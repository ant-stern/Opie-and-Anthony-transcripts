<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a self-aggrandizing introduction highlighting their controversial image as "shock jocks."  They immediately launch into a graphic and sexually suggestive description of a Discovery HD segment featuring a nude Brazilian tribe, detailing their activities and rituals with crude humor.  The conversation then abruptly shifts to the "Cinnamon Challenge" incident involving staff member E-Rock, playing audio of his severe coughing fit and choking after consuming a large amount of cinnamon.  The hosts express concern but also find the situation humorous, strongly advising listeners against trying the challenge and detailing E-Rock's subsequent doctor's visit.  They also discuss Jim Norton's upcoming shows, a new CokeLogic animation, Alex Trebek's health, a rise in Long Island home invasions, and explain their recurring catchphrase, "woot."

The home invasion on Long Island is discussed at length, focusing on the intruders terrorizing a family, including throwing a one-year-old down the stairs.  The hosts debate home security, advocating for armed self-defense while making jokes about the intruders' methods and the victims' responses.  Listener emails referencing "woot" are read, along with a Jeopardy-style clue about Coumadin.  The E-Rock cinnamon challenge video is again promoted, this time with emphasis on the hosts' reactions and its availability on YouTube.  A news story about a paramedic, Lonnie Hazard, accused of sexual assault is discussed, with the hosts engaging in comedic, speculative scenarios surrounding the incident.  The show promotes an upcoming screening of "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," confirming John C. Reilly's appearance the following week, briefly mentions Britney Spears' behavior, and Ben Bailey's "Cash Cab" show's mention of Opie and Anthony.  A listener's audio interpretation of sounds set to music and a "Grammy Minute" segment are also featured.

The show continues with a discussion of their appearances in pop culture trivia games, particularly concerning the "Sex for Sam" incident, followed by a discussion of their poor sports trivia knowledge and brainstorming absurd game show ideas like "Ghetto Cab."  This leads into increasingly bizarre scenarios involving home invasions, ranging from nude cheerleaders to hostage situations involving cookie-baking intruders.  A news story about an 18-year-old who broke into a house, viewed pornography, and took pictures of himself on the victim's phone is discussed in detail, along with listener submissions including a potential kindergarten bomb threat and unclean hotel glasses.  This segues into "Whippin' Mount Wednesday," with a call from a listener who had sex with a coworker on "Opie and Anthony Day."  A significant portion is devoted to playing and critiquing Scott and Todd's song, "Have a Roly-Poly Christmas," filled with crude humor about weight gain and overeating.  This segment is interspersed with discussions of the E-Rock cinnamon challenge video and the Mitchell Report on steroids.  A conversation with producer Elo about the podcast's launch on iTunes and XM follows, along with discussions about the show's iTunes presence, a sub-par smoothie, and a playful threat of a livestreamed spanking of a staff member.  Vulgar language and sexually explicit topics are frequent throughout.


A segment featuring a crude description of a staged spanking between hosts Jimmy and Kenny transitions into an update from XM employee Elo regarding subscriber numbers (over 8.5 million) and podcast download strategies.  The E-Rock cinnamon challenge video's viral success is again discussed.  A phone call with Elo praises the show's freeform style, leading to tangents about Opie's potential need for therapy, his marijuana contemplation, and a detailed description of his girlfriend's reaction to a missed call.  Discussions of bodily functions and wiping with clothing follow.  The latter half focuses on a heated feud between Roland (Ron and Fez) and Paul O., fueled by Paul O.'s criticism of Roland's film reviews.  This involves accusations of lying, insults about Roland's appearance, and a challenge to a physical fight.  Audio clips of Paul O.'s disparaging comments, including personal attacks and accusations of homosexuality, are played. Roland responds defensively, countering with insults.  A song mocking Roland by Eastside Dave is played.  The "Money Honey" segment and a "Google bomb" attempt to boost the E-Rock video's views are mentioned.


A heated on-air conflict between the hosts and Roland erupts, stemming from perceived disloyalty and a perceived slight regarding John C. Reilly's guest appearance. Accusations of "trashing" each other, lack of communication, and insults regarding Roland's energy, sexual orientation ("sound gay"), and penis size are exchanged.  The discussion becomes increasingly vulgar, with comments about defecation, body hair, and sexual acts.  Inflammatory comments about Dave's baby are made.  Fez's participation in the insults is noted.  A physical altercation between Roland and Eastside Dave ensues, fueled by aggressive insults about family members and physical attributes.  Roland seemingly wins the physical confrontation.  The show concludes with promotions for Jimmy's New Year's Eve show and Opie and Anthony merchandise.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say? 
[00:01:00]  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the Hams.  This is where entertainment is going.  I do not touch that.  The only thing that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  Oh my God.  They are sick.  Freaks.  How close did you get to having relations with the dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch them all.  It's time for people to understand these are words. 
[00:01:30]  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Now that we got the dramatic intro out of the way, we can start the silliness of the Opie and Anthony show.  Dramatic drivel over dramatic garbage.  At least we acknowledge it.  Oh, such important music. 
[00:02:00]  I wonder about like the person listening to us for the first time, like a newbie.  And they hear the dramatic ecstasy of gold, the big build up.  Important program.  A big, huge introduction.  And then this crap behind our voices now.  It's going to be an important program.  And the newbie sitting there going, wow, this must be a very important radio show.  Yes.  Full of all the issues of the day. 
[00:02:30]  Issues.  No.  No.  No.  We just almost kill our fellow employees.  We almost kill our staff.  And then we go through the news and find funny stories about mishaps with people's genitals.  Good morning, though.  We're a little bit of everything.  Yeah.  When we have to, we do show our intelligence. 
[00:03:00]  Try to keep that to a minimum.  And then we get this.  Discovery, uh, it's day.  Oh, it's day.  Why are they blurring out, though?  Because they're guys' butts.  Oh, but they're showing boobies.  Hey, boobies.  Wow.  They're showing the boobies.  All right, hold on.  I got to turn.  Wow.  They show breasts, but not the S?  They beep out the S?  Yeah.  The guy's buttocks is blurred out probably because it's not just a butt shot, you know?  Oh, there's something else. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I forgot.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Wow, there's a little whipping going on.  There's banking, there's some old guy smoking a peace pipe.  What is this?  This is a whole montage of wacky things this tribe is doing.  This is some wacky tribe.  Man, they like, uh, they're nudity.  They like being naked.  Yeah, they cut themselves and leave all the blurs.  It's just guys' junk all over the place.  They just, the Yawala Pity.  Yawala Pity.  Pity.  Yawala Pity.  Yawala Pity.  Yawala Pity.  The Yawala Pity. 
[00:04:00]  The Yawala Pity.  And that's the tribe from Brazil.  Yeah, wow.  They're on the river, off of the Amazon River.  And they love being naked.  They just showed two naked girls catfighting on regular TV.  Now, I gotta tell you something.  For me, it's regular TV, because everyone has cable at this point.  It's, uh, what?  It's Discovery HD, right?  Let me, uh, look.  Oh, my goodness.  This is like...  And they all got a hard day's night haircut. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're all going...  The Paul.  The Paul.  Now, this is quite interesting, because, um, if the African tribes...  Uh, the women are a lot more, uh, saggier, it seems, than the South American tribes.  Yeah, look, man.  Oh, look.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  This is way...  Dude, this is complete spank material.  This is way too hot, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's barely, like, blurred out. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, you can see...  You can see what's going on.  Oh, now they just threw a girl in the middle of a...  Look at their...  Oh, my God.  Dude, first of all, they're not, um...  They're not saggy.  No.  Which is odd, because the same gravity...  They're showing girls' butts, no problem.  They're showing everything.  A bunch of kids running around.  And they're just showing, uh, uh...  Yeah, children of all ages.  Wow.  The guys.  Look, wait a minute.  They didn't blur out enough on that first guy.  I think I see.  Either that or that's a satchel he keeps his marbles in. 
[00:05:30]  No, what happened with that is they...  It's a bunch of guys doing kind of like the elephant walk.  Oh, they're all sitting in there.  They're sitting right next to each other with their shoulders on the guy in front of them.  And they're blurring out their junk.  But the one guy, uh...  Well, I think his is a little lower than the rest.  So it was popping out of the blur.  Dude, this is the most bizarre culture ever.  Now they're completely nude, but they're grabbing each other from behind. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They're trying to put...  Like, the one on the end is trying to be...  The girls have to pull you off one by one.  They certainly do.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Firm bosoms.  Yeah, why is that?  I don't know why.  They don't have brass ears.  And the guy has to hold on to the guy in front of them while the girls pull him off.  Yeah.  What are they trying to do?  Yank him away from his homosexuality?  I guess that was more of a visual, but...  Now they're holding his head down on the ground.  The guy is holding on to the guy in front of them, and then a bunch of naked women grab  the guy and try to, like, pull him free. 
[00:06:30]  Imagine you're just canoeing down this river, and you come up on this tribe and just go,  this is the greatest tribe I've ever seen.  Beavis, we have found paradise.  Look, the guy's holding on to a pole, and I guess he doesn't want to be dragged away  by the naked women.  I don't know what that's about.  Jimmy, I would say they like being naked.  Yeah, I would say that they certainly have an affinity for it.  Yeah.  It might even be a little more than just liking it.  I could say that, like, I like being naked, but apparently this group love it! 
[00:07:00]  They can't get enough of it!  They love to be naked.  Jimmy, now they're frolicking in the water.  They sure are.  This is almost porno.  Jim, were you here last time we checked out the HD channel?  We've looked at this, but we keep missing them.  Oh, no, okay.  I've been here when we've caught them.  I guess they only...  They do them early in the morning.  They only do the tribe show, like, once a week.  We've got to remember.  Yeah.  I think it's every Wednesday.  Wednesday. 
[00:07:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  All right, now we've got the guys in the water frolicking.  They're frolicking, and they just slow-moed.  Bunch of men with Moe Howard hairdos just frolicking.  It's frolicking nude.  Moe Howard, Pete Rose, mongoloid, Paul McCartney here.  Early Beatles.  All right, now they're carrying stuff on their head.  Ah, and they're coming out of the water.  Oh, my God.  Look at the busums on these.  And the one girl looked like she had, like, Victoria's Secret boy shorts on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:08:00]  I'm losing my mind.  This could be a vacation mecca if they wouldn't, you know, hit you with poison darts when you  pull up.  Ah, white man.  Funk.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  Now the sun's setting.  And now it's nighttime, so I guess they're going to get all naked.  They sleep in hammocks.  I guess that's to keep the bugs out of certain areas.  Snakes don't crawl up.  Yeah.  All right, now they've got a little fire going.  That discovery. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  There's some old codgers sitting on a rock, and something was hanging down like a melting  Turkish taffy.  Well, he was sitting on the rock, and another part of his body was sitting on the dirt floor.  And I was going to tell some old story about why they have this silly hair.  I think something is going to happen tonight.  We're reading now.  Bunch of lesbian heads.  Something will happen to the moon.  Oh, boy.  They still think something's going to happen to the moon.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:00]  What the hell happened?  All right.  A copy of one of the Beatles' albums from, like, 1967 fell out of a plane, and that's  it.  They decided.  It was the gods talking to them.  Yes, they had to get that hairdo.  Dude, how hot was that?  That was some hot native footage.  Last week, it wasn't as hot.  I mean, the girls were naked.  They were topless.  But gravity was taking its toll.  You've got to give South American savages a lot more credit than African savages for other 
[00:09:30]  high-definition television shows, because it seems the South American savages, they have  firmer breasts.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I don't know.  It must be their diet.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Lions.  Huh?  I mean, maybe in Africa, their breasts sagged because they move so much running from lions.  They're constantly running from lions.  Because they're prey.  In South America, they're the boss.  In Africa, they're prey.  They're frolicking here with each other.  And in the African one, it was pretty much trying to get food and not be food. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, this one is more like Club Med.  The one where...  Yes, Club Med.  This is like Club Med.  They're just having our keg party.  They play fun games here.  They put all the guys off.  Yeah.  You know.  You're all naked, sitting in each other's laps.  Yeah, laughing.  Call me crazy.  I think these guys, they don't like the women as much.  Nah, it seems like they're very happy with each other.  Holding on to each other.  Whipping the back of another man.  Yeah, why are they whipping each other's buttocks?  I don't know.  They're into the whipping thing.  They love it. 
[00:10:30]  I got to find out about that.  What was it?  The Yawa...  Well, Yawa Kapiti...  Look at this guy.  What nice cheeks.  Is that a guy or a girl's hiney?  I can't tell.  That's a gentleman, I believe.  That's muscular.  No.  Well, now I'm starting to think it might be a girl.  No, that's a gentleman.  I don't know.  You see how he just stomped his foot after his whipping?  Those are guy legs.  You can't tell.  Guy legs and a girl hiney.  A fine combination.  That's exactly what we were looking at, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Now they're...  What are they doing now?  They're doing some kind of ritualistic, probably a war dance. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, with big sticks.  Big dumb yellow hats.  Yeah, they're all painted up.  Paint each other up.  Me and you.  What do you say?  Are they going to go hunting?  Sitting on each other's laps and have women pull us off.  Uh-oh.  They're going into some big, huge hut with their...  Big, thatched hut.  With their long...  Now they're painting a butt.  Painting like an ass of some young, firm...  I know.  These guys are obsessed with the butt.  Brazilian.  They are Brazilian, aren't they?  Now they're painting up each other's butts. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, there's flies on their ass.  Oh, God.  A fly just landed on their butt.  This is hysterical.  What?  No.  Who is watching this for it being like an education of other cultures?  You're just kind of watching it, trying to catch a quick piece of ass or boobage.  Most of them are not that attractive.  They're hot for people who sleep in the dirt.  But it sounds like modern-day hot.  They're really not.  If you were in the jungles of Brazil like that and came across this tribe, though... 
[00:12:00]  You would never go home.  You would just be...  You would rip up your ticket home.  Oh, yeah.  No, I wouldn't.  You would rip up your ticket.  Come on.  They all kind of run, walk, like they trot.  You know you could just...  It would be every night a different savage woman.  I would just turn into the slut of the village.  That's it.  Look, they painted their heinies up with some cow blood.  Now what are they doing?  That's got to smell nice.  That's... 
[00:12:30]  And these are like, I guess, potential brides.  Maybe those are the grooms.  Maybe this is a wedding.  I know.  Because they seem kind of young, these girls.  Either that or they're getting ready to play Parcheesi.  I don't know.  Why not just get married at church?  They're running in circles like a bunch of idiots.  Why did you change...  Oh, there it is.  Church.  They think something's happening to the moon.  I don't know if they're advanced enough to believe in the Almighty.  Yeah, they have some primitive beliefs on God and whatnot.  Yeah.  They worship like a coconut falls and everybody runs over and talks to it. 
[00:13:00]  I've had enough of these people.  They contribute nothing.  They build nothing.  They run in circles.  They blow darts on things and eat it.  People suck.  But they like pinning each other up.  Exactly.  They sure do like to paint each other.  Oh, God's paint.  How about building condos in this dump?  I've given them a chance and they've failed.  I haven't seen one wheel.  Of course you have.  I haven't even seen the wheel.  They'd eat it if they saw a wheel.  I've had enough of these people.  And paint each other like a bunch of just savages. 
[00:13:30]  And you wonder why the man comes in and just like destroys their homes.  Just starts hacking down the forest and just builds McDonald's or something.  They probably gave them like a case of Pepsi or something or Coke.  Yeah, they love it.  And then they, yeah, gave up everything for that.  Some guy with a pith helmet shows up and he goes, wow, this is great land.  My word.  They hand him a rock and they go, oh, he's like, oh, these won't be difficult people to overtake.  We're going to relocate your tribe, see?  Yes.  That's pretty much the guy with the pith helmet. 
[00:14:00]  Now they're all painted up and now they come out of the little hut sideways dancing.  They love to dance.  They certainly do.  And there's leaves on them.  They have leaves on them.  Yeah, now they have leaves on themselves.  There's not a tree within eight miles and they think they're hiding.  They're fools.  They're in the middle of the dirt.  They have leaves hanging off their arms like something won't recognize them.  They're in a circle.  What else is new?  A bunch of children.  A bunch of nine-year-olds.  They really are.  I don't know what their jobs are. 
[00:14:30]  They haven't shown like the women or the men doing anything.  Of course not.  You're not going to see any stock trading.  One guy in a grass skirt.  Hi-ya.  In a circle.  That's fun to watch.  Those guys pounding a piece of bamboo.  It's a fly with human spit on it.  Whoa.  That's a delicacy.  Wow.  And now we're back to naked boobies with their butts painted up.  And they got like a tail.  They put like a little piece of grass in there to give them a tail.  And they got nice long black hair. 
[00:15:00]  They look to be in their teens.  All of these?  Yeah, they're like young girls, and I think they're potential brides.  That's what I'm gathering from this.  Let's just put it this way.  If the skin color was a little different, and they found this on your computer, you're  going away for a while.  You'd go to jail.  You're going away for a while.  Why is that?  You could film like young, under-18-year-old nude girls.  Look at that girl.  That girl is nowhere near 18.  That girl right there is probably, and these girls are nine or ten.  Those girls were nine or ten. 
[00:15:30]  Why is that?  Because it's far away.  Look.  They're showing.  Oh, look.  Dr. Octopus is sitting there naked.  Gawk.  Pink hair and a yellow hat.  We really need to.  We should test neutron bombs in this area.  The man with pink hair and a yellow hat.  He's the head muckety-muck.  Why aren't we going over there with like a hundred guys and taking over this area?  A hundred guys?  One guy with a match?  I think you're the fire god.  And you can burn down everything they own.  One Zippo lighter is like a nuclear bomb to them. 
[00:16:00]  Just get a big flat screen TV and a Wii.  And let them play with that for a while as you just completely take over their village.  People are saying Africa.  It's not African.  They're South American.  They showed the map.  They live on Amazon.  Yeah.  They're kind of off the Amazon.  You have no idea how bad I want to go there and just slaughter the indigenous people and  build a mall.  I want to just remove that indigenous dribble and put a big wall in a place for people to 
[00:16:30]  shop and buy Starbucks.  Here they are now.  I guess this is them working.  They're fishing.  So that's probably what they do after all the dancing.  I would like to force them to take showers and put on jeans.  Yeah.  Put on Western clothes and feel all uncomfortable.  It's like when you try to put a sweater on your cat.  Yeah.  They just walk around all silly trying to get it off with their teeth.  Make them put on jeans and a Nike shirt with a swoosh.  Jesus. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  That was wrong.  All right.  Some people are joining in.  Nice mo cut.  Like people are now watching.  Of course you got to watch this.  And they're firing arrows at the fish.  How about a...  Why don't you get a worm and a string with a hook?  Almighty.  They're firing arrows at fish.  And they got some...  And they're catching things.  Wow.  They are amazing.  And they're catching fish that way.  Of course they are.  That's great.  They'll wear them as earrings instead of eating them.  Now they're dopes.  Oh, here he goes.  He's going to conk them on the head with a log.  Oh, God damn. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, this is brutal.  Oh, he's smashing the fish over the head.  The fish got mouthy.  Got all lippy on him.  The fish is like, get this stick out of me, would you?  He conked him with a log.  He bashed him three times in a big fat log.  Looks like they're...  At least I hope it was a log.  It might be a purpose for running around half nude.  It looks like they're praying to the Pete Rose guy.  Now two guys just start dancing in a circle around each other.  They're on all fours and now they're fighting. 
[00:18:00]  And now they're just going to wrestle.  Some barbaric ritual of course.  Oh, God.  It's just...  Nude men wrestling.  We have no concept...  Of fun.  It's just...  Of fun.  Of good, clean fun.  Two men nude wrestling.  Oh, look.  One's got cinnamon in his mouth.  I don't get...  This is sort of like taking them and just plopping them in the city.  Yeah.  They wouldn't be able to understand it.  And we watch and we just don't get what they're doing. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  They're all muscled, though.  Well, I guess that's how we start today, huh?  That's a fine opener.  A little description of some of the HD, Discovery HD, down there in Brazil.  And you got to bear with us because this stuff pops on every once in a while in the morning.  We don't know when it's on.  We look for it every morning since the last time.  Yeah.  And we haven't seen it until today.  And it's a new tribe.  Wow.  That guy really needed a lot of blur.  He must be a popular gentleman in the tribe. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Imagine they're all left up as a tribe, though.  Like a guy with like a big...  Just a big...  Yeah.  A monster.  Is looked at as like...  They laugh at him.  They openly laugh at him.  It's all about having a teeny weenie.  Let that go through.  Yeah.  No?  Probably not.  It's all about having a tiny, you know.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, more women.  We'll never get off this subject if we leave this on. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  We're just going to watch these nude Brazilian women.  Know what we should do as a radio show?  We should drop like a Victoria's Secret like lingerie.  Oh.  Wouldn't that be great to just see them walking around in like miracle bras and a little lingerie?  They wouldn't know what to do with it.  They'd build a hut out of the material.  They'd try to live in the catalog.  They'd probably throw it into their soup. 
[00:20:00]  Into their gruel.  Their gruel.  Yeah, they just...  It doesn't look good.  All right.  What they're eating.  We're going to take a quick break, but why don't we get Drew Boogie's remix on before  we do this?  Please.  Steve hates midgets.  Do we have to explain the Steve sounds by now?  I hope not.  No.  Steve warms up his vocals.  I'll play this one.  Before he plays production.  Because I have a feeling we're talking to just a few newbies today, so why not maybe  get them on board a little bit?  So, Steve, he makes really weird noises when he warms up his voice to do production for 
[00:20:30]  the show.  Ah!  I didn't realize.  Ah!  I hate it.  How can you not?  I hate it.  And he does many noises very similar to that, and the listeners have taken it upon themselves  to kind of throw those noises into song.  Right.  What?  Drew Boogie, everyone.  What?  What? 
[00:21:00]  What?  What?  What? 
[00:21:30]  What?  What?  What is he doing?  What?  Do you see what the hell's going on?  I can't look away.  Now there's like a topless woman.  Oh, what's she doing?  Well, now that's a, is that a girl or a guy? 
[00:22:00]  That's two girls.  Okay.  And the other girl's completely naked, and they're taking this thing, this tool,  with a lot of like sharp points on it, and just scraping the crap out of the naked girl's body.  And they start bleeding.  I've seen this before, and then they let the blood dry.  They scrape some kind of pattern in them or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  It's a new video.  Two girls, one crab shell.  Okay. 
[00:22:30]  We're getting a request for Metallica that came in yesterday.  With the Steve Sounds.  Yeah, with a fun one.  This is the Steve Sounds, Put to One. 
[00:23:00]  What?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[00:23:30]  That one is giving Drew Boogie a run for his money right there. 
[00:24:00]  Metallica won.  That was sent in by Hirsch in New Jersey.  Great job on that.  Okay, listen.  We've got to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to check in with Cinnamon Man.  We almost had a major situation yesterday on the radio.  Oh, man.  Not even exaggerating, a major situation.  We'll explain next.  But E-Rock, there was a moment there he was in a bit of trouble.  We'll explain next.  And I think we also, I hate to say it, but I think we have to do a public service today. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Because I think there's a lot of people out there that will try this.  Yeah, a definite PSA.  And E-Rock ended up in the doctor's office, and he had doctors saying, make sure no one does this.  Yeah.  We'll explain next.  It was pretty crazy yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton. 
[00:25:00]  Jimmy, how's your tickets selling?  They're good, man.  Yeah?  At the Borgata, January 20th.  And New Year's Eve here in New York, I'm doing my first Long Island show in a long time at the North Fork Theater.  You can go to Ticketmaster for that.  And we're giving away tickets at one point, hopefully today.  Four tickets.  So if you have friends and you're broke, you can come.  All right.  A little later on, we'll give away tickets to see Jim Norton.  What, New Year's Eve?  Yeah.  I'm there.  I'm happy you're going.  I am there.  That is how I am spending my New Year's Eve.  Are we doing the FH afterwards or what? 
[00:25:30]  I would like to.  Yeah, very much.  You want a piece of my sister's cheesecake?  Yeah.  Shove it in my fat face.  I would like that a lot, actually.  I might need probably transportation.  I probably shouldn't be driving on New Year's Eve.  No.  You probably shouldn't be driving from December 17th to January 8th.  At this point, you shouldn't be driving into work.  Absolutely.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah.  Come on.  It's a turkey from Thanksgiving.  Anthony thought he was going to get some kind of surprise from Jimmy and I.  Oh, really?  Maybe I should get a ride. 
[00:26:00]  Enchanting group, really.  OCD, alcoholism, and sex addiction.  Three zilches.  At this point, you should have a full-time driver.  You're not fooling anyone.  My sister is doing so well with the freaking baking, she's going to start her own business.  Really?  That cheesecake is like taking over the world.  I like a good piece of cheesecake, but I always pinch my stomach fat while I'm eating it.  And go, oh, it goes right to my thighs.  All right.  Here we go.  I'll just rub it into my thighs. 
[00:26:30]  Rub it into your face.  I was at my girlfriend's family's, and I was going to eat meat, and I point at the toilet,  and I go, well, that's where it's going to wind up anyway.  And I threw the food in, and no one laughed but me.  And I went, ha!  And I put my arms out.  Even with the hat, no one laughed?  Yeah, I think I'd get a big laugh.  Hey, you know what?  This is going to be a little weird for us.  It's going to be a little weird for us right now.  We did something yesterday, and I think at this point we're convinced that you could actually die doing this. 
[00:27:00]  So I think we really have to, or I think for the first time in our careers, do a public service.  A disclaimer, a public service, something.  I'm not even joking, man, because I know how this whole YouTube culture is taking off,  and I know a lot of people are going to try this, and we're not the first.  No, no, that's the problem.  See, we watched a lot of these on YouTube.  Right.  And it looks hysterical, it looks very funny, the people do look like they're in some type of distress, 
[00:27:30]  maybe respiratory distress for a while.  Yeah.  But you're watching it on a video, you know it turned out okay.  Yeah.  So you're under the assumption that this is something safe and fun to do.  Well, when you see it live, you realize how absolutely dangerous this is,  and we actually really thought there was a good chance that Iraq was going to die in front of us yesterday.  Or have a major, major issue, yeah. 
[00:28:00]  A major issue.  No, I thought he was going to stop breathing.  You were very close to calling 911, right?  Yeah, it was, there was a situation, there was a point where he couldn't breathe.  Right.  I don't even know how this came about.  I think one of our listeners said, hey, you've got to go on YouTube and check out Cinnamon Challenge.  So we check it out, and there's this really hot blonde girl with her boyfriend, I believe, in a kitchen.  If that's the boyfriend, man, she's got to leave.  And I guess the challenge is you can't, like, what, swallow a teaspoon or a tablespoon of cinnamon. 
[00:28:30]  You're putting your mouth dry, you just can't swallow it.  Yeah.  And listen to us, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie and Anthony.  Well, this is, yes, this is a step out of character here.  This is a very rare appearance by Greg Hughes, but you've got to listen to us today.  I can't believe we're doing this, but we have to.  I know.  So we see this blonde do this on the video.  We're laughing, you know, hysterically.  She's having a pretty big problem in the video, but she's okay. 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  So then we're like, ah, E-Rock's got to do this.  Yeah.  And Bob Kelly was in yesterday, and I blame Bob Kelly.  Oh, I do, too.  All right, you do, right?  Absolutely blame Bob Kelly.  Because Bob Kelly, you couldn't put another granule of cinnamon on this spoon.  It was a heaping, helping, just mounded up.  It wasn't even a rounded spoonful.  It was an Everest-style peak.  Right.  That was on this teaspoon, and he put it all the way into the back of E-Rock's throat 
[00:29:30]  and dumped the cinnamon there.  Yeah.  So it wasn't even like on his tongue where E-Rock might have been able to control the quantity.  I was under the impression he dumped it directly down his windpipe.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  That's kind of what he sounded like.  E-Rock's mouth looks like when you start up an old diesel engine.  Ba-rum-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  So right away, E-Rock started gagging, and all of a sudden, he coughed up what can only 
[00:30:00]  be described as a cinnamon cloud.  It was literally a cinnamon cloud.  It was a big dust cloud of cinnamon came out.  But the thing was, it wasn't like he put it in his mouth and then coughed, and it came  out of his mouth.  He put it in his mouth.  He had this sick inhale and then started coughing.  So the cinnamon was in his lungs, in his bronchial tubes, and then he coughed and it shot out 
[00:30:30]  in a cloud.  Yes.  It was like watching a swarm of bees from a distance.  Little cinnamon bees flying out of a fat mouth.  He looked like, what's his name, from the Green Mile?  John Coffey.  John Coffey with those flies coming out of his mouth.  And I got to tell you what I was thinking at that point.  Because the cinnamon was pretty much coughed out of him within, what, a second?  Yeah.  Some of it, anyway.  Yeah, some of it.  And I'm thinking in radio terms, I'm like, oh, this sucks. 
[00:31:00]  We didn't get much out of this whole thing.  Oh, no.  And then it continued and continued and continued.  And then we pretty much stopped talking.  Anthony's getting ready to call 911.  E-Rock is choking.  He couldn't breathe and he couldn't drink water.  Right.  Which I don't know if that's a good thing or not, to drink water, because it's not water  soluble cinnamon.  So it just kind of, I don't know, puts it further down in there. 
[00:31:30]  What's that, E-Rock?  It turns it into paste.  Into a paste that you can't then cough out, really.  Right, right.  So cinnamon is great, gently sprinkled on your French toast, let's say.  But a whole spoonful in your mouth is absolutely not recommended.  You want to hear the audio from yesterday?  Who doesn't?  All right.  And we got to say it.  And no one told us to say this.  We're just showing some kind of responsibility.  Do not do this. 
[00:32:00]  Trust us.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not even joking.  I have a text to Dr. Steve.  I would love to know, because it does get sucked down when you breathe in.  Like, there's some reason that this really can't.  We had a doctor call in and he said that it gets caught in your vocal cords.  Like, it really, you can't.  It gets everywhere.  Your throat actually closes.  Closes up.  It clenches.  You'll hear it in the audio.  You'll hear E-Rock's throat clenching.  Closing.  It's almost like a type of a pepper when you do it.  Because I've heard people die from trying to do that with pepper. 
[00:32:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They will just die.  Your throat will close up.  We had no idea.  We were stupid enough to look at a hot girl do it on YouTube and said, ah.  But, you know, I think she did a little less.  And maybe she didn't, like, inhale as much as E-Rock.  I don't know.  But we're highly, highly recommending that you do not try this at all.  A horrible way to die.  Here's the audio if you don't.  It smelled great, though.  Yeah.  Here's the audio if you don't believe us.  Listen to E-Rock struggling.  Ready?  One, two, three. 
[00:33:00]  Go.  Okay.  E-Rock is attempting.  You all right, E-Rock?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is he doing?  You all right, E-Rock?  How is he?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you ****.  Holy ****.  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose. 
[00:33:30]  He's too.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  There's a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock. 
[00:34:00]  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  Holy ****.  And then poor E-Rock gets himself fired in the middle of the whole thing.  And we're back live.  That continued for a long time.  That's just a little taste of what happened yesterday.  Oh, there's one part where you hear this lick.  He goes.  And then.  And then you.  Like he's trying to breathe.  But there's so much liquid in his mouth that he's been coughing up. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Just listening to that.  I just.  Look how far Bob puts it in his mouth in the video.  Yeah.  What a bastard.  See?  That's to the back of his throat.  We're watching the video right now.  And immediately E-Rock is having a problem.  There's cinnamon dust flying out of him.  And we even slowed down the cinnamon dust.  Yeah.  It's all slow motion.  And the laughing Travis in the background.  When you watch this video the 80 times I know you all will on YouTube.  Look at the giggling, laughing, doesn't care if E-Rock dropped dead in front of him, Travis, who is behind E-Rock holding the microphone. 
[00:35:00]  Well, Travis doesn't like E-Rock.  No, of course not.  And this completely shows that.  And he'll come in here and go, no, I like E-Rock.  But we know differently.  Poor Eric.  When you watch the face, he looks like a guy in trouble.  Like, I was watching him yesterday and I was like, I knew it sounds funny, but it's like he really looked like he was choking me.  He was in respiratory distress.  And I think if you had any kind of respiratory problems that maybe you don't know about or heart ailment or something like that, that would absolutely kill you. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, so, I mean, we highly recommend you do not do this.  If you don't believe us, check out the video.  Best cinnamon challenge ever, E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  It's up on YouTube under that title.  Best cinnamon challenge ever, E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  Let's go to Slick in Jersey.  Slick, what's up?  Yeah, it sounded like Opie was a little upset.  I think it would be a good idea for E-Rock to, I don't know, apologize.  E-Rock, he's saying that you owe Opie an apology. 
[00:36:00]  Well, E-Rock, he's shaking his head.  What the hell is that?  E-Rock, in the middle of this, like, tells me to shut up.  And then a little later on when he continues gagging and choking and stuff, I go, E-Rock, you know what?  Why don't you take the day off and we'll discuss tomorrow how you told me to shut up.  But after, he was having problems for what?  At least 10 to 15 minutes.  Easily. 
[00:36:30]  But real problems.  Like, real problems.  And then after that, he continued to puke in the bathroom.  He pretty much puked all over the place.  His eyes got bloodshot.  He broke the blood vessels in his, like...  The whites of his eyes.  And ended in the upper cheeks by his eye sockets.  Oh, that's what that is today?  Yeah, all around his eyes.  I said he was going to have, like, black eyes.  Yeah.  Your ears, too?  Yeah.  His face turned purple.  He was trying to cough, but his throat was closed up. 
[00:37:00]  So all the pressure was building up from a cough that was being, like, choked off at his throat.  And his head was just turning purple.  Yeah.  You couldn't breathe.  And all the blood vessels started popping in his ears and by his eyes.  Were you scared?  Yeah, because I kind of was blacking out.  Oh, man.  If you would have blacked out, it would have been great.  Guys, I'm telling you, this is the real deal.  Do not try this.  Yeah.  It was really scary yesterday.  And then, and then, E-Rock... 
[00:37:30]  Hold on for a second.  That brings up the fact that he looked like Arnold in Total Recall when they shot out the window  and rolled down the sand, and his head started getting real big.  Right, right, right.  That is exactly what E-Rock looked like.  He had cartoon head yesterday.  It went purple from his throat up.  Anyway, E-Rock, after he sort of calmed down, which took close to an hour, he came back in  the studio, and his hands and his arms were ice cold. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know what that was about, but they were ice cold.  Like, to the touch.  It was creepy.  And he was really dizzy and lightheaded.  My exterior was cold, but inside it felt like I was burning.  Yeah, you were like setting up for something.  Like, your body kind of shut down the extremities and wanted to keep all the blood close to the  vital organs.  Wow.  Man, were you a mess.  After the show yesterday, I'm just finding out about this.  Only a few minutes ago, you went to a doctor?  Yeah.  What happened after the show?  You still were having problems? 
[00:38:30]  I was in the bathroom, just kept continuously coughing up cinnamon, and about an hour or so  after the show was over, I went down to the doctor.  Why?  You felt so bad.  Yeah, I was really lightheaded.  I was having trouble pretty much walking.  So I went down to the doctor, and when I explained to her what I did, she leaves the  room and brings other doctors into the room, and she goes, tell them what you did. 
[00:39:00]  It's a test study in idiocy.  She was amazed that you did this, and she needed other doctors to hear it from your mouth.  Yes.  So I explained what it was and what it was for, and then she looks at me and she goes,  do not let anybody else there do this.  Well, no crap.  We don't need to do this.  Do me a favor.  When we see my girlfriend, don't mention to her what happens when you do it.  Get that under your hats. 
[00:39:30]  And then what did they say?  They said, well, water was probably the worst thing for me to take.  Good thing.  We were saying drink water.  Yeah, it turns it into a paste almost like talcum powder.  And it just, when the cinnamon goes into your mouth, it absorbs all the moisture in your  mouth and your throat, which is why no one can swallow it, and adding water to it makes  it worse.  So then she, after a few minutes, she checked me out.  She said, I'll be okay.  And then she wanted to know where this video was going to be posted the next day.  Why? 
[00:40:00]  She wanted to see it.  Of course.  Who doesn't?  Did they say you're going to still be breathing up cinnamon?  Did it actually go down in your lungs?  Yeah, they were finding it in my teeth, and they would, they, um...  Along with the rib.  There was a throat culture, that throat culture thing they were doing, and they were like,  look, and it was still on the back of my throat.  They found it in your teeth, the back of your throat, in your cholesterol, where else?  But, uh...  She was worried about the, um, the, uh, the, uh, capillaries and everything that broke, so... 
[00:40:30]  Broken blood vessels, yeah.  Why is she worried about that?  Yeah, just because she thought my eyes were going to get all puffed up, and it looked  like I got punched in the face, like I got two black eyes.  Yeah, I, I, when, when I came in this morning, I'm like, wow, why is he all red around his  eyes and his cheeks, and it looks like, yeah, like, the capillaries there bursted as well.  That's so, I, I had no idea.  Yeah, she was trying to figure out how it happened, like, in my earlobes and everything.  It was all over the place.  Yeah, you, you were ready to, your, your head was ready to explode. 
[00:41:00]  It was like scanners.  He was trying to just, uh, explode.  Oh, you poor bastard.  I don't know what you do for this show.  The, uh, video's up on YouTube.  Best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony, and, uh, I swear, this is Greg Hughes, the actor that  plays Opie.  Yeah.  Do not do this at home.  Do not try this.  And, and, and, and please even like, spread the word not to try this.  It's not, uh, it's not as funny to watch it in, in person as it is on video. 
[00:41:30]  I'll tell you that much.  Well, Travis laughing his ass off, you know, and we were laughing as well.  Cause we thought, Oh my God, what a great reaction.  This is hilarious.  And, but there was a lot of moments yesterday when this was going down where we were like,  Oh my God.  Did you care more?  Let me, let me, I'll be honest.  Did you care more for E-Rock safety or your own, um, job and wellbeing and, um, lawsuit?  Well, you're, you always got to worry about yourself first.  Yeah.  That's what I was doing.  All I was thinking was, Oh my God, if that idiot drops dead, um, I'm screwed. 
[00:42:00]  I'm screwed.  How does this affect me?  Yeah.  But you were the one that almost called nine one one.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  It was one of those things like, what do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  And then someone's like suggesting water.  We don't know water.  We did our research by checking out a blonde doing this on YouTube, rub some leaves on it.  Put some leaves on it.  And so, and before we did this, we were asking around if anyone knew how to do CPR and I'm 
[00:42:30]  like, stop, shut up.  All I was thinking too was how silly we'd look in the media.  Well, Opie and Anthony have finally done it.  They've killed somebody with cinnamon.  It just would have, the story just would have been, these jackasses should have been all  off a long time ago.  Now the poor Nagel family's going to a funeral.  Guess which?  It smells great, but guess which shock jocks killed somebody with a tasty treat? 
[00:43:00]  That's what it would have been, the tease.  Or like awful post headline cinnamon, but with an S instead.  S-I-N dash.  Oh, sin.  Sin a man.  Sin a man.  Sin dash a dash man.  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  This video has got legs big time.  Yeah.  Big F in time.  Well, what happened to Iraq when you called Iraq yesterday after the show and asked him  how he was?  What was his report?  You know what, Jimmy?  It's funny you should say that because I do have a heart.  Yes. 
[00:43:30]  And what did I say the first thing when I came in today?  I apologized for not calling him yesterday.  Oh, no.  I realized I should have.  Am I the only one that called to see how he was doing?  You did call him?  No.  On the heels of the shock jocks killing somebody with cinnamon, is the cinnamon in your house  dangerous to your children?  We'll be doing an investigation.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Michael in Orlando.  Hey, what's happening?  Are you calling from O-Town?  From O-Town, son?  O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  That's a scary place, O-Town. 
[00:44:00]  It is.  What do you got, bro?  Well, I went to culinary school for all of about two weeks, but one of the things I learned  before I dropped out was that cinnamon, in addition to being not water-soluble, it clings  to all the moisture in your mouth.  You also, it's one of the spiciest of the spices in its raw form, so it completely stops  you from being able to ingest it.  Your body shuts down, and that's why his throat wasn't able to take it down and why it turned  into such crap. 
[00:44:30]  In addition to that, I know that if E-Rock was to try it again, try to mix it with mayonnaise.  What is this?  I don't appreciate that concern for our friend Eric turning that into a fat joke.  E-Rock, you all right, though?  Yeah.  You know, we beat you up a lot on this show.  Just a tad.  But I got to tell you, this guy has given us some amazing radio.  Because after the YouTube video, you know how they suggest other videos?  It's a whole, like, greatest hits of E-Rock, and I didn't even realize all the stuff he's 
[00:45:00]  done on our show.  He's cried, he's laughed.  The tearing of the wax is great.  It's one of my favorites ever.  Where he falls off the toilet and hits his head while they're waxing his armpits and makes  that sound.  Spanking that stripper really hard.  I mean, just amazing stuff from E-Rock.  There was a couple others I can't remember offhand.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Hey, can you play that audio again as we go to break?  This is E-Rock, and I got to say it again, and I really hope that people spread the word. 
[00:45:30]  Do not try this at home.  It's on YouTube right now, the video, if you don't believe us.  Best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on O-Bean Anthony.  This is the audio, though, once again.  This is audio of a guy in some serious trouble for a little bit here.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Okay.  E-Rock is attempting...  You all right, E-Rock?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking. 
[00:46:00]  What is he doing?  You all right, E-Rock?  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Like that.  Water, you...  Holy...  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose.  He's pure.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water. 
[00:46:30]  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  It was a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy s***.  That was funny.  Right in the beginning, there was a part where Jimmy goes right there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Where he goes like...  That's when...  That's when I got...  I can't breathe.  That's when I got really nervous.  Yeah.  Because that was like the sounds of a guy who really couldn't breathe.  Yeah.  Just a thought.  All right.  We'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Word of the year.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:47:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 877-212-ONDA.  Also, ONARadio.com has all the links, all the visual links that we talk about on this  fine radio show.  And it also has Stephen S. from Bayshore's show rundown.  Woo!  Woo!  Steve rules.  What's this woot all about, Anthony?  Woot.  Woot.  Woot is a word used in online video gaming. 
[00:48:00]  Pretty much.  Yeah.  It's when something good happens.  Um, it's used in a lot more of the geekier games, I think, than the real, you know, action  games.  How do you spell it?  EverQuest.  W-O-O-T.  Someone will write woot.  Yeah.  Woot.  Like if, uh, let's say you're a little, um, squad.  Your little squad of people goes out and eliminates, uh, what you went out to eliminate.  You will all give a good woot. 
[00:48:30]  Woot.  Or if someone got some, some nice, uh, loot.  Some nice loots you'd give from, uh, something, you'd go, woot.  And if a girl gets naked and says, do you want this?  What do they type?  W-H-A-T?  Yes.  That is the what.  Well, it's, uh, the word of the year for 2007.  Woot.  Woot.  W-O-O-O-T, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  W-O-O-O-T. 
[00:49:00]  Lowercase W.  Uppercase O's.  T.  Yeah.  There's plenty of ways in leet type.  By the way, um, I, I, we just mentioned, uh, O-N-A-Radio.com.  And E-Rock is pointing out that there's a new CokeLogic animation up there for you to check out.  I think, uh, pretty much once a week, CokeLogic gives you a, uh, an animation that you can check out on O-N-A-Radio.com.  And this one's called, what, uh, Stranger Danger?  Stranger Danger.  What is it? 
[00:49:30]  Where basically you don't want to, uh, have any interact, interaction with little kids anymore.  Because everyone's paranoid they're going to have a Chris Hansen moment, even though they're not trying to have a Chris Hansen moment.  Yeah, so you, you don't want to be alone with children under any circumstances.  Yeah.  In a public restroom, in an elevator, anywhere.  It's based on a Bill Burr bit when I saw him recently, and we talked about it on our show.  And now CokeLogic has animated it.  And I'm just looking at a little kid in a men's room with Anthony coming out of a stall, his arms to his side like, whoa, whoa, I didn't do nothing. 
[00:50:00]  And the kid is pointing at Anthony like he did do something.  But it's a very innocent thing.  Obviously nothing actually happened.  And, but this is what you deal with in this day and age.  You're scared to be with, uh, kids because, you know, first of all, kids are just dopes.  And they're going to say that you touched them even though you, you were trying to give them a helping hand or something.  I don't know.  Never try to give a helping hand.  Right.  The second they get in any kind of, the second they sense that they're going to be in trouble for something, they'll just turn on anything around them. 
[00:50:30]  There's a, there's a, uh, uh, a screen cap.  It's, it's, it's Bill Burr animated because it's, it's, it's, it's his bit.  And, uh, Bill said that even if, when you come across a kid that's in trouble, like he's crying and you need to give him a tissue, you should give him a tissue by holding out a really long stick with the tissue on the end of the stick.  Just so there's no interaction with the little fella.  So check it out for yourself.  Uh, very interactive radio show. 
[00:51:00]  You know that by now.  Oh, and a radio.com.  Word of the day.  We did that.  Woot, whatever.  Uh, oh, uh, Alec, uh, Trebek.  He's, he's going to be okay, but he had a heart attack.  Alex Trebek.  Yes.  I like to say Alec.  Alec.  Is it Alec or Alec?  Sir Alec Trebek.  Alex Trebek.  Alex.  He, uh, he married a, uh, Harborfields broad.  Diddy from your hometown, huh?  His, uh, his wife, I, I used to take the school bus, uh, just a little dumb fact, O&A trivia. 
[00:51:30]  Oh.  But I used to take the school bus with, uh, Alec, uh, Trebek's, uh, wife.  They've been married forever.  What is to school?  Huh?  School bus.  Oh, I thought it was a question.  Oh, no.  What's answering?  Jeopardy style.  She lives like a quarter mile from, uh, from, uh, from, uh, us.  What is Centerport?  Very good.  Very good.  Yes.  All right.  And, yeah, we got some, some stuff to get to.  We have another home invasion.  Mm-hmm.  We can't even keep up with the home invasion, uh, news stories. 
[00:52:00]  There was one yesterday we never got to.  There's a new one today.  Uh, people are asking you about your video podcast about home invasion.  Yes, I, I actually have the, uh, thing in my, um, flash drive in my pocket.  Okay.  I have to see.  I'm getting close to actually posting it.  Okay.  It's on this.  It's on my little flash drive.  How many gigs is that?  That is one gig.  You're sweet.  Of flash drive.  I love those things.  You just pop in.  So, are people going to be able to check out your, your video podcast soon?  Yes, very soon.  All right. 
[00:52:30]  Well, we can.  And it's all about home invasions and weapons.  You know, Ant's turning me around here.  Thank you, Kenny.  You are turning me.  Because now that we brought this home invasion to everyone's attention, uh, through the radio  show, there's, there's not a mooring that goes by without a brand new one.  Out on Long Island, they're calling it a rash of home invasions.  These, these criminals see easy pickings.  This, this is an easy target for people.  They know that, uh, they can, they can walk into a majority of these houses, not be confronted  by anything but scared homeowners and, uh, get their valuables by just pistol whipping 
[00:53:00]  them a little bit.  But, uh, they don't have to, uh, for the most part, they don't have to worry about a murder  rap unless it's some kind of personal vendetta.  But for the most part, they go in there, beat the crap out of them, steal, uh, their goods  and leave and leave the family traumatized for life.  That's something that doesn't go away.  You know, years later, you're still, you know, dealing with that one.  Right.  So, uh, I've decided I won't be somebody that's going to fall prey to that. 
[00:53:30]  Uh, we moved on from woot way too fast.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  He writes, woot is inscribed on the sword of the gay.  Ah, the sword of the gay.  Actually, the sword of gay, right?  Yes, it was the sword of gay.  Linger Linger.  Yes, uh, Blue Heeler.  Thank you.  Sword of, I think it was the sword of the gay.  Of the gay, right.  It has to be of the gay.  Of the gay.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Woot is gay slang for slide it in. 
[00:54:00]  And Steven S. from Bayshore writes, I'll take Coumadin for 100, Alex.  Oh, Jesus.  And time for an audio daily double bypass.  He's going to be all right, though.  67 years old.  Yeah.  Uh, 34 million people a week watch that dumb Jeopardy.  Ooh.  Still?  I stopped watching that years ago because I just...  Like the 80s.  I just realized I didn't need any more knowledge in my life.  That's...  My head's full.  That's right.  I've had it.  Memory full. 
[00:54:30]  Here's, uh, the latest home invasion and then we'll stop the tape and Anthony will start,  uh, uh, explaining what the, what this family did wrong.  Okay?  Exactly.  Raise your hand when you want me to stop this.  All right.  Just get in there and give your, uh, expertise.  Okay.  Janice Davis...  Stop.  What happened?  Shoot through the door.  Something's out there.  Oh, my God.  Better safe than sorry.  No?  Janice Davis feels lucky to be alive after three armed men wearing masks burst into her 
[00:55:00]  home and terrorized the family.  It happened at around 10...  Now, I don't know, burst through the door, is this, is this a locked door?  Or they're, they're so aggressive they went right through the locked door, it wasn't open?  What do you think, Ed?  That's what they don't tell us in yesterday's home invasion, because like Ope said, every day  we didn't get to talk about home invasions.  Uh, in yesterday's home invasion, they didn't talk about how the intruders got in either.  Uh, they showed police that were around a window, so perhaps that window was open. 
[00:55:30]  In my podcast, you'll hear me talk about windows, and open windows, and how you gotta check those  things.  Yeah.  Especially after people are in your house.  Yeah.  Doing work, maybe.  Check every window.  All right.  Uh, but they didn't tell you, they say burst into the house.  Did they kick the door in?  Well, uh, obviously your locks aren't good enough.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna guess they had one of those, um, Trojan horses.  If somebody gets home invaded through the old Trojan horse gag, they deserve everything 
[00:56:00]  they get.  I'm gonna guess they went old school.  It was a Trojan horse with really nice rims on it.  Maybe it was a big fat lady with like 50 criminals under her dress.  Right.  My car's broken down.  They opened the door.  I'm gonna guess a really tall guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they're all under, uh, his, his big trench coat that goes to the floor.  All right.  I'm gonna guess a horse.  Yeah.  Do you get it?  It happened at around 1045 last night at their home in Wyandanche. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, Wyandanche.  In the county of Long Island.  All right.  Mrs. Davis, her husband, her children, and grandchild were in the home at the time.  The men ordered them on the ground as they searched one of the bedrooms.  The men were very aggressive, even tossing the one-year-old grandchild down a flight of  stairs.  Oh, my God.  Oopsie.  And you're, you're basically saying if you have guns in the home, they're not tossing  the grandkid down a flight of stairs. 
[00:57:00]  Uh, when you're standing there watching your young grandchild being tossed down the stairs.  You know, the, the grandchild that you're scared to hold because you think you're going  to break its neck.  Still got that little soft spot, maybe.  Right, right.  He's landing on the floor in front of you.  Uh, all you're thinking is, oh, my God, how do I deal with this situation?  These people might want to kill me.  They, instead of, uh, taking decisive action before it even gets that far and, uh, leaving  them with, uh, holes in them, bleeding on either your front lawn, if they walk out, run 
[00:57:30]  out.  Usually, usually they do that.  I'm trying to run away from death thing.  They, they find them a few yards down the street.  Death will always beat you in that foot race when you got a hole in your chest.  Uh, they find you with a, a, a pulled hamstring.  Yeah.  A pulled hammy.  Ow.  Now this hurts.  But, uh, yeah, you got to leave them, you know, leave them regretting what they did for 
[00:58:00]  a few minutes.  Right.  Uh, uh, Steve from Jersey.  Yes.  Woot.  We owned other teams.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  Okay.  Oh, cool.  But, um, Woot's been used for a long time.  What's the word of the year, though, Ed?  The word of the year.  They got to give it a little attention.  How about a D with two zeros and a C-H-E?  That's what they should type.  Oh, my God.  It's a spelling joke.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Douche.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  I want to know where, uh, us came in this year.  Us.  That should be word of the year. 
[00:58:30]  It's probably Poe just misreading the word us.  He doesn't know any better.  Us.  I bet you that's the, uh, the runner-up word of the year.  Us.  Yeah, of course it is.  Woot.  Woot, gentlemen.  More on the, uh, home invasion out there on Long Island.  So he smashed the baby out of her arm.  Mm-hmm.  And he, like, tossed him.  So at that point, it was like just to hear him scream loud and knowing that you can't move.  You can't move because if you move, you got two up above you and one standing in front of us. 
[00:59:00]  Unbelievably, that little baby is okay.  After tumbling down those stairs, they did take the child and the baby's mother to the hospital to be checked out.  But they have been released.  Wow.  One above you, two over there.  You let them take up tactical positions in your own goddamn house.  They all have to come through that front door.  Let me tell you that one.  They all have to come through a door.  Your best defense is having a situation where they all have to come through one place. 
[00:59:30]  You ever see the 300?  They had to go through the narrow little, uh, valley there.  Mm-hmm.  And 300 guys are holding off, uh, oh, my God.  Just thousands and thousands.  Thousands and millions of enemies.  Thousands and thousands.  If you get a home invasion and they got to come through a door or a window, you got to keep stuff secure enough where it's going to take them a little while to get in.  The front door sounds like they either kicked it open or it was left open, which means your locks aren't good enough.  And then when you hear that commotion, grab your weaponry, take up a position, that door flies open, bam, they're all right in your sights. 
[01:00:00]  Start shooting.  No kid getting thrown down the stairs.  And, and, and, and just to be really safe, keep a gad in the diaper.  Yeah, you should.  So that way, uh, you grab your child and, uh, you could fire right through the diaper.  Hopefully get them with some fecal matter.  What do you do, though, if, uh, you're in a different room and they grab a loved one and they walk in with a gun pointed at your loved one's head and said, put down your weapon.  How'd they get in the house?  Well, let's just say they come through the window, a Blitzkrieg style attack and your loved one's in the living room. 
[01:00:30]  There should be guns there.  Well, you know, people don't have enough money.  And a moat around the house like Anthony's building.  Save it.  Save your money.  Buy guns.  Guns.  But what if that does happen, though?  What do you do?  What, if someone flies through your window?  No, no, no.  But say someone's got your, your girl, your loved one, your kid or whatever.  You shoot the hostage.  Play your longer.  Is Santa too fat?  Go away.  Uh, Lydia from Oceanside. 
[01:01:00]  What's up, Lydia?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I'm a clinical psychologist who had called Anthony crazy.  Oh, God.  We hate your voice.  I forgot about you.  Remember Lydia?  She called me crazy.  I hate about my voice.  Yeah.  Turn me around.  I'm going to tell my husband to go dig up his gun.  Very good.  See?  That's cool.  And there, by the way, there will be at least one, if not two more home invasions by Friday  on Long Island alone.  Dude, they happen constantly on Long Island. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know why.  I didn't pay attention to this crap until Anthony really brought it to all of our attention.  And there will be at least another one, if not two more, by Friday.  Well, let me ask you, with as many home invasions as there are, and people that don't know,  how come you never hear about criminals really being shot by homeowners?  Because homeowners are idiots.  They don't, because, because, see, Jimmy, I'm considered crazy.  No, you're not.  I address that in the podcast, that I am considered crazy.  What do you mean, considered?  I, well, see, because of, they call me paranoid, and crazy, and insane, and a little too into 
[01:02:00]  this whole thing.  They also call you Italian.  Exactly.  I might just have a race-based affinity for weaponry.  First way to avoid home invasion, don't live in wine dance.  Thank you.  We were trying to, we were trying to leave that out of the equation.  Well, and this one doesn't sound like a typical innocent home invasion, because apparently 
[01:02:30]  they had some kind of a person living in the house that may have been involved in some  shenanigans, as I like to say.  It's a home invasion just the same.  It is.  There were innocent people caught in the horror of a home invasion.  And I think if more people were, thought about it, and gave home invasion some thought,  I think you would see more of these guys getting blasted as they come in the house.  Alarm systems, a good lock, a good lock on that front door, and be very alert. 
[01:03:00]  People that just skip to their front door at night, and unlock it, and walk in, and they  have bushes around the house, and they don't look.  Like, I kind of give a good look around the house.  When you pull in, and your headlights sweep the house, or something like that, look in  your bushes.  Look around.  Look to the side of your house where your garage is.  Make sure no one's going to follow you in.  Why don't you just have all the bushes taken out, and have floodlights put there, and have  concrete so they can't crawl through the grass? 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Good idea.  And have heat sensors on the top.  I like that.  Claymores?  I have a feeling Anthony will have someone walk in the perimeter within the next year.  Don't need it.  Why do I need that when I got video?  And a car out front with some big, burly dude just eating big subs.  Why do you need that?  Video surveillance.  Lighting.  A lot of lighting on the house.  The house is lit up like a Belgian castle.  It really is just lit up.  Is it hard to break into your house? 
[01:04:00]  I wouldn't say it's hard to break in if you're, you know, motivated.  Anybody will break in any place.  It's going to be hard to leave alive.  It's going to be very hard to leave, yes.  It's very hard to leave holding your innards in.  How many guns do you really have in the house?  I wouldn't say that for security reasons.  Okay.  But I do have a few.  Say more than three.  Yes.  All right.  And in my podcast, I do bring out a few of these weapons and give a little rundown.  When are we going to see this famous podcast?  A little rundown on how effective each one is in home invasion defense and how ineffective 
[01:04:30]  some of them are.  You're like Axl Rose.  I'm building up the hype.  I'm building up excitement.  Well, so did he for so long that no one gives a crap anymore.  When are we going to actually get to see this thing?  Speaking of Guns N' Roses, thank you for that, Anthony.  We have Sweet Child Oh My.  Jimmy likes this one.  There's another one I like, too, which we got today.  Yeah.  We're going to play those right now as well.  Oh, I didn't realize. 
[01:05:00]  The sounds of Steve.  There's many of them.  Oh, the sounds.  And our listener is putting them to music.  I hope that's all I have to do today to explain this thing.  This bit has taken on a life of its own.  This came in yesterday.  It's worth playing again.  It's Tom and Philly.  And then we got two, maybe three new ones today.  It takes me way to that special place.  And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry.  I didn't realize. 
[01:05:30]  I didn't realize.  That's a good one.  That is pretty good, right?  All right.  And then this one came in today.  Let's get right to the new ones.  When we were young, the future was so bright. 
[01:06:00]  The old neighborhood was so alive.  Every kid on the whole damn street.  Just going to make it big and not repeat.  Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn.  The kids are caught up, but the lives are worn.  Walking one little street.  Swallowed so many lives.  Oh, ends abruptly, but I like that.  And people got to understand, these sounds weren't made specifically to put to music.  Yeah.  These are just random noises he made. 
[01:06:30]  Just stupid Steve making noise.  And then the listeners try to figure out how it fits into a saw.  This one's really good, and it's from our own intern, Bon Jovi, Faithfully by Journey.  This one's really good, and it's from our own intern. 
[01:07:00]  It's the dumbest, stupidest thing.  I don't know why it's so funny to me.  I don't know either.  And then, wow, this is for the people that linger longer.  You want to explain Fire, Fire, Fire?  It's bad, bad, bad.  When I was a kid, I used to think this was the coolest song ever. 
[01:07:30]  It was about the boy who cried fire.  Yeah.  And I didn't know where to get it, and of course, I mentioned it on the air.  And I used to think this was like rock music when I was like five.  And one of the listeners sent the record in, and this is about a boy who cried fire.  And he would sing about calling the fire department, and they eventually didn't come.  Someone out there picked up on the old, the time we talked about that on the show.  This is my favorite song ever. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, he would talk about how you loved it.  I didn't like this song.  I loved it!  It's all I thought about.  And it will get stuck in your head.  We missed you yesterday, because we had some kind of wizardry.  I heard that when I was on my way in.  Anthony said, where's Jimmy?  The wizardry.  Wizardry.  We needed some of your wizardry.  Woot!  That's wizardry.  Yes.  So here's Fire, Fire, Fire.  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire everywhere. 
[01:08:30]  There's a fire in the closet.  There's a fire in the bed.  There's a fire sitting under my chair.  There's a fire in the sink.  It's so hot I'm turning pink.  Oh, doesn't anyone care?  Then he reached up with his arm, and he pulled down the alarm.  And he knew the engines would soon be there.  You know, I know we're known for beating bits into the ground. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, yes, we are.  But for some reason, this just still has a life, this thing.  Yeah.  Just when you think, all right, time to move on.  The new ones come in, and you can't help but enjoy them.  The listeners are going to freak out now, not knowing what happened.  He burns. 
[01:09:30]  He burns.  He burns up.  I say he's dead.  Well, the engines are coming.  Then all of a sudden, nothing.  Yeah, no fire.  He keeps doing it until one day the fire department doesn't show up.  He doesn't die, but he does have a very surprised look on his face for the rest of his life.  That's right, and no lips.  He has no lips.  He has to buy wax lips from the store just to kiss girls.  How about you just make up your own ending like I had to do last night?  I was watching The Biggest Loser.  The one problem with the DVR thing is when you've done it too, right? 
[01:10:00]  Yep.  I hit pause.  I went and got some stuff done.  I come back to The Biggest Loser.  Who gives a crap about the show?  I understand, but I fell for it.  I'm enjoying these fatties losing weight.  All of a sudden, they're getting ready to kick off this dude.  I'm like, oh, they can't kick off this dude.  He's lost 143 pounds.  How do you kick off the guy that set the record for losing the most weight at the fad camp?  I take the remote because I realize what is about to happen, and I slam it down on the couch, just hit it really hard. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, boy.  Live.  Live.  All of a sudden, the channel changes.  Oh, yeah.  And I realize I'm not recording, which I usually do, and the show jumps to live, like you just said, and now it's the end of the show.  Yeah.  Like the whole buildup to someone getting kicked off is who gives a crap.  They're on treadmills and stuff, but it's interesting to watch them weigh in and get kicked off, and it jumps to the end of the show. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  So I had to make up my own ending last night and go, well, I guess he cried and was sad that he got kicked off, and I guess they show him now, and he's a lot thinner.  I don't know.  How mad were you when you did that?  Dude, I looked at Lindsay, and she's like-  Is she laughing?  She's laughing, and she's like, calm down.  It's your own fault.  And I'm like, I'm such a dope.  Had the sweet and adorable little Jack Jack step on the remote a couple of times.  Good.  And-  He had a-  No.  No, not little Jack Jack.  I had a kill-  Steve from Bayshore.  Give me that.  I'm going to guess you boiled him alive for doing that. 
[01:11:30]  No.  You just say, oh, no, boy, and you pat him on the head, and he goes-  Well, how about you put the remote where stupid Jack Jack can't get to it, like in a bear trap?  You take that back, Jimmy Norton.  And he goes in there to get it, and he's jack, jack, jack.  No.  No.  And you know what, Jimmy?  What I give you today is a woot, woot, woot for that.  I want a woot, woot.  You get a woot for that.  We owned other team. 
[01:12:00]  Do you?  Oh, wow.  Bill from Waterford is noticing my choice of TV program.  Extreme Home Makeover and Biggest Loser.  Are you eating estrogen for breakfast, O.P.?  You might as well add Little People Big World to the list, where little Matt Roloff has all sorts of medical problems now,  and the season finale is next week.  Got to see how he's going to handle his diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  That's the way it's pronounced, diabetes. 
[01:12:30]  He's got some of that diabetes.  You know what he should do?  He should send to Liberty.  Liberty will deliver your diabetes drugs.  And then when you get him, you'll start saying it like diabetes instead of diabetes.  I don't know why old walrus mustache says diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Testing supplies. 
[01:13:00]  Don't put sugar on your Quaker Oats oatmeal if you got the diabetes.  Diabetes.  Wilford Brimley.  Yeah.  And also, tonight is the season finale of Kid Nation.  Kid Nation.  No one talked about that this year, really.  It started off hot, right?  Then it was just kind of faded.  Hot.  Yeah.  Why don't you talk about how hot it is?  No, no.  Not that type of hot.  Sit down.  Have some lemonade and talk about how hot the show is.  No, but it didn't start off like really a big thing that no one cared. 
[01:13:30]  The ratings are huge for 5 to 12-year-olds.  Yeah, yeah.  The kids love it.  And parents.  Everyone in between is not watching except for some dopey shock jock.  We don't like kids.  That's why we don't watch them.  Who got caught up in this nonsense.  Is the cute little model girl still in?  Yeah.  I'll tell you why I got caught up in Kid Nation.  I think I got a good excuse.  My lovely niece in Orlando.  Your pederast.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Your hard drive crashed.  You need something to watch.  My lovely.  Gary Glitter gives it four stars. 
[01:14:00]  My lovely niece, Kelly, down there in Orlando, is very good friends with one of the stars  of Kid Nation.  Which one?  And I forgot her name.  That one.  That one.  Right there.  That one.  This one.  The one that was the sheriff last week.  Yeah, her.  Sheriff.  I forgot her name.  The sheriff is it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oops.  Shit.  That's why I took a peek, because Kelly said, hey, my friend.  Oh, right there.  Go over, like. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, right.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Sophia.  Cinnamon in your eyes.  What the hell?  Right there.  Sophia, who's a big star of Kid Nation.  I mean, they got.  Oh, that girl.  I know who she is.  They got a ton of kids on Kid Nation, but this one is featured a lot.  Sophia.  She's 14, and she's friends with my niece in Orlando.  So Kelly called me up and said, yeah, my friend, like, all of a sudden just disappeared  from school, and she wasn't allowed to say where she was going.  She went to film this show, and now she's a big star down there in Orlando, and that's  the reason why I started watching initially, and now won 20 grand two weeks ago. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, she won one of those big challenge things.  Yeah, so that's why I.  Gold star.  Watch in the season finales tonight.  All right.  Oh, and people are checking out E-Rock's Cinnamon Challenge video.  You're getting a lot of hits there.  What is it called again?  Best Cinnamon Challenge Ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  I just put in E-Rock Cinnamon.  E-Rock Cinnamon?  Yeah.  That seemed to work.  It's an amazing video.  We do a lot of videos, and a lot of them go viral, but this one is quite special because 
[01:15:30]  E-Rock was in serious trouble yesterday during our show, and you can check it out for yourself.  The video, now that we know you're okay, the video's hilarious.  Yep.  Absolutely hilarious, but once again, we got to tell you, do not try this at home.  This is a bad one.  Poor boy.  Very.  But people are laughing their asses off on instant feedback.  They think it's hilarious.  So check it out for yourself on YouTube.  Best Cinnamon Challenge Ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  He's got eyes as blue as time. 
[01:16:00]  As if they thought of green.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony with little Jim Norton.  We're giving away tickets to my New Year's Eve show.  If you call up now, the phrase that pays is, Travis is a queer.  If you say that, you get a pair of tickets to my New Year's Eve show at the North Fork Cathedral  on Long Island.  You get one pair of VIP passes and one VIP parking pass so you can park where you want. 
[01:16:30]  We're giving away two of those, so each person will get a nice pair of tickets plus this other  stuff.  So call up now.  Travis is a queer.  And you'll get your New Year's Eve tickets.  Only for the first two callers.  And I'll throw in a slice of cheesecake for my sister.  And Sweet Opie is throwing in a slice of cheesecake, which will not be brought to the show.  No.  You will have to go to FH Riley's after.  Rose Restaurant and Honey.  How great would it be if you just brought in your pocket and made them fish it out? 
[01:17:00]  And I didn't tell you how big the slice was.  It's going to be a little slice.  Just a sliver for your tongue.  It's going to be as thin as a piece of paper, but enjoy it just the same.  First two callers and give the phrase that pays.  All right, phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  If you don't give the phrase that pays, you can't get them.  That's right.  Make sure Travis has to hear that on the phone.  That's right.  Hey, a lot of people checking out the video at this point.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Holy S, I just watched the E-Rock Cinnamon video, and I had to take a few puffs off of my 
[01:17:30]  asthma inhaler.  That was hard to watch.  Yeah, you feel yourself like not breathing.  Wheezing.  You're with him not being able to breathe.  Yeah, it's YouTube, best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  Getting a lot of views right now.  I wonder how many little kids have died doing that, not realizing what it is.  Like, you know, they have a little cinnamon, and they just take a big taste of it.  Yeah.  I wonder if little, I bet your kids have died doing that.  Those kids love cinnamon.  Because cinnamon's good.  And we highly recommend you do not try this. 
[01:18:00]  We learned the hard way yesterday.  We all went into a panic.  I mean, E-Rock went into the biggest panic.  Oh, yeah.  But we were also panicking right alongside him.  Anthony actually reached for his phone.  He was ready to call 911.  It was a big deal yesterday.  No, actually, I was just texting.  Yeah.  Bob offered water to kill him.  Travis laughed.  Sam filmed.  We all snapped into action immediately.  I sat there quietly.  And now that we know he's okay, the video is definitely hilarious. 
[01:18:30]  There's not one definitive hero amongst us.  We would just stand there.  We're spectators.  That's not true.  I've done a lot of...  You think we would be...  Oh, really?  Yes.  You think we would be spectators in E-Rock's death?  Leave him alone.  Yeah, we all would have stood there watching him die.  That pretty much would have happened.  Someone call 911.  Okay.  Can we offer any help until then?  No.  You've got to break down that outer wall of yours.  You do.  Which one?  You really do.  Which one?  Because you were close to calling 911, but you don't want to show people that you were 
[01:19:00]  a little...  No, I didn't.  You had a little emotional yesterday.  I show that every so often.  It slips out of...  What do you think, Jimmy?  What do you think, Jimmy?  What do you think?  If you listened to the audio yesterday, the entire piece of audio, you would realize  I was the most concerned.  Yeah?  I was.  All right.  I analyze, but don't do it.  I was saying breathe slow.  I was telling him not to try to catch his breath all in one shot like that.  Slow breaths.  And then I checked his pulse.  I don't touch people here in the studio. 
[01:19:30]  I don't touch you guys.  Oh, you did take his pulse.  And then I felt his hand to see if it was cold, and I took his pulse to make sure.  How cold was his hand?  His hand was pretty cold, but no colder and clammy than in all of our listeners at signings.  You know, I learned something about myself yesterday.  Yes?  That it takes me a long time to get out of radio mode.  And actually start thinking over things?  I'm just thinking as far as a bit goes.  I'm like, ah, the audio's... 
[01:20:00]  It's okay, but he could be hacking a little more.  And then I'm like...  Oh.  And then his face is turning a little red, but I'm like, ah.  Still concentrate on the audio and how people are perceiving this out in radio land.  And then finally a snap out of it, like, oh, my God, someone called the EMTs!  He's starting to think, uh-oh, this could be trouble.  So we got that audio again.  It's worth definitely replaying again.  It's one of those things that's worth replaying a few times.  Yeah.  But if you want to see the video, it's up on YouTube.  YouTube.  What is it called again?  Cinnamon Challenge, E-Rock, Opie and Anthony, something like that. 
[01:20:30]  We'll get you there.  Best Cinnamon Challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  But here's the audio.  And Jimmy brought it to our attention.  And pretty close to the beginning of this, you hear E-Rock just wanting to take a deep breath.  And you realize he's not getting air.  It's when he goes...  And then there's this other gurgling.  It almost sounds like...  Where so much liquid is just coming out of his mouth.  He's trying to breathe.  And it sounded like a sucking chest wound. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  It's a few seconds in.  And, uh...  Yeah.  All right.  Here it is.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Okay.  E-Rock.  Not here.  You all right, E-Rock?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is it?  You all right, E-Rock?  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Right there.  Water, you...  Holy... 
[01:21:30]  A whole cloud came out.  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose.  It's too...  Breathe water.  Drink water.  It's not Bob.  It's going to kill him.  I've ever seen.  Drink water.  You fat idiot.  Drink a little water.  What a whale recommending water.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead. 
[01:22:00]  E-Rock.  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It does.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  It was a cloud of cinnamon that went across the room.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy s***.  That's when I knew...  That's when...  That's when I was knocked out of radio mode, by the way.  Yeah, that's when you knew it was serious.  E-Rock would never tell me to shut up.  He just wouldn't.  Shut up!  That's when I laughed and went, whoa, this is pretty serious, man. 
[01:22:30]  He's fighting for his breath, but he uses the little bit that's in there to say, shut up.  And a lot of people telling us, yes, it's very dangerous.  Of course it is.  We are acknowledging that today, and we want to get the word out that this is probably something you shouldn't try.  But we do blame Robert Kelly...  Completely.  ...for what happened yesterday, because...  Much too much cinnamon on the spoon, and he dumped it right on the back of his tongue.  Yeah, I guess...  Yeah.  Right to the back of his throat.  Stupid Bob Kelly.  And then you naturally try to breathe, so all that is going down in you, and then now he's, like, just coughing it up. 
[01:23:00]  And trying to get it out of his lungs.  I don't even ever, ever want to know what that feels like.  No.  I'm watching the video and just seeing that cloud of rust coming out of him.  Yeah, best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  It's up on YouTube.  All right, moving on.  Paramedic accused of sexually assaulting patient.  You want to talk about the perv switch that we talk about from time to time.  Yep.  You never know when that perv switch is going to go off.  It's in all of us.  Most of us control it. 
[01:23:30]  Well, you usually just think about it.  You see some hottie walking by, and you look, and maybe for that split second, your mind runs through some fantasy or something.  Some scenarios.  And you walk on your merry way.  You're done.  And then all of a sudden, you're done with that, and you're like, I'm going to go get a slice of pizza.  Yeah, I'm a little hungry.  Like, it goes like that.  Yeah.  But to others, it just goes off.  It's a switch that, it's the switch between the thought and your actual muscles of your body to make you perform whatever wacky thought is in your head. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  A fantasy.  Yeah.  So that's the perv switch, yeah.  Well, listen to what this paramedic did.  A lot of dentists have weak perv switches, it seems.  Oh, yeah.  They really love gassing up those girls and ripping the blouse open.  Sure they do.  Trust them to help you during a medical emergency.  But tonight, Portland detectives say former AMR paramedic Lonnie Hazard sexually abused a patient while taking her to a local hospital. 
[01:24:30]  Dave.  The F.  Dave.  What the F?  Really?  Well, hold on now.  How old was she and what was her injury?  Let's take this in context.  75-year-old Edna Burns was flattened by a dump truck.  Well, then Lonnie's a weirdo.  You know, it was a stripper who twisted her ankle.  Lonnie's all right with me.  Basically, let's not judge the guy.  Of course not.  All right.  We're in no position to judge as of what we know right now. 
[01:25:00]  You're right, Jimmy.  We're walking out of an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, caught a bug shot to the chest.  Lonnie's a creep.  All right.  A cheerleader that had a memory loss.  She has a cheerleader with amnesia.  I understand Lonnie's thinking.  You know, sometimes it takes Jim to put this all in perspective for us.  Let's start over, then.  Let's give Lonnie the benefit of the doubt.  Lonnie Hazard.  You might want to get ready with that buzzer there, Anthony.  Hold on. 
[01:25:30]  I got a few.  Uh-huh.  We're going to give him the benefit of the doubt, but hold on.  Hold on, sweet old Lonnie.  Hold on.  We got to set up a little bit here.  Bear with me.  I just want to know what the circumstances were.  Here we go.  Trust them to help you during a medical emergency.  But tonight, Portland detectives say former AMR paramedic Lonnie Hazard sexually abused a patient while taking her to a local hospital.  Dave?  Yeah, you worked as a paramedic, volunteered, and helped the needy.  But tonight, police say Lonnie Hazard sexually...  How funny. 
[01:26:00]  I got to stop it again.  How funny is it that the guy's name is Lonnie Hazard?  Lonnie Hazard.  He's obviously a hazard.  Yes, he's a hazard.  Everyone around him.  It's like that dentist, Bill Cavity.  Max Power.  Lonnie Hazard.  He's an action hero.  He's a Lonnie Hazard sexually abused a woman while he was taking her to the hospital for help.  Very neighborly friendly, warm, charitable, giving himself.  Right.  Really?  Who's that? 
[01:26:30]  Lonnie Hazard's dad.  Very good.  He actually has a thesaurus.  But they're all adjectives for good.  Very helpful, slash well-behaved, slash conscientious.  Good thing.  Fine.  That's right.  He's a dandy boy.  Friendly.  You're unconscious, and your breasts are exposed.  Then he grabs them and yells whore until his neck veins pop.  He's a good boy.  Unless you're asleep.  All right, let's find out more. 
[01:27:00]  According to Portland detectives, Hazard was taking an adult woman to Legacy Emanuel Hospital sometime Saturday.  And once at the hospital, the woman complained she'd been sexually abused.  Because of privacy laws, Fox 12 is unable to find out exactly how old the woman is and what she was being treated for.  But after investigating, police arrested Hazard Monday, charging him with two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree.  Tonight, his friends in Vancouver say it's all too hard to accept. 
[01:27:30]  So it sounds like it's an old woman, huh?  I don't know.  They didn't say the age, but they did say woman.  This story sucks.  I know.  What happened?  Not enough detail.  It was getting hot for a second.  We have to know what exactly it was.  Did her breath smell like a tequila worm or nitroglycerin?  There's a big difference here.  Good old Lonnie Hazard rules.  Well, we got Snapman from Wackbag.  Lonnie Hazard's cousin is Guy Compton. 
[01:28:00]  Guy Compton.  Linger Lunger.  Nah, we don't get enough of this story.  It's not the picture of Lonnie that we know.  And based on that, I have to go as a friend and say I'm behind him 100%.  Tonight, AMR tells Fox 12 Hazard was a paramedic with the agency for years  and that he was put on paid administrative leave,  but as of tonight, is no longer working for the company.  At this point, he's still innocent.  So, and that's important to remember no matter what's put out there. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, sure.  And detectives want to have contact with women who may have had contact with Hazard.  If you have information on this case, please contact Portland Police.  How do you have information on this case?  If maybe you were in an ambulance with Hazard and he had done this before,  some women don't report these things.  I think it's a medical procedure or something.  If you're coughing on cinnamon and he goes,  here, this will help suck this.  Yeah.  Well, I got to say, that was a bust.  That had such potential.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Without knowing the age of the woman and the injury. 
[01:29:00]  I was hoping something.  You know, Jimmy brought up a great thing there.  Given CPR through a TF.  Oh, my God.  We need chest compressions.  Let me just take this.  Okay.  Don't worry.  I'm okay.  Lonnie Hazard will help you out.  Zip.  The ambulance in the woods.  There's nowhere near a hospital.  Bite this wallet so you don't shout. 
[01:29:30]  Wait a minute.  We're not out of the hospital.  Yes, this is Lonnie Hazard's house.  Don't worry about a thing.  He shocks her with those things and he yells,  Clear!  And then she bucks back right on to him.  It gets her to move better.  She didn't want to move her hips.  Clear!  And her ass moves back on.  Lonnie Hazard knows how to get things done.  Lonnie Hazard.  Lonnie Hazard.  Lonnie Hazard is God.  He rules.  He should be on Grey's Anatomy.  And no, I do not watch that show.  Or House.  I was just coming up with a stupid hospital show.  I do not watch that one. 
[01:30:00]  On an all new house with guest Lonnie Hazard.  Lonnie Hazard, right.  House has to find out why Lonnie keeps humping the patients.  Why patients are coming with any problem all of a sudden need sphincter repair.  Or he's on St. Elsewhere and he treats Ed Bigley's face in a way that no man should.  I'm going to go with your house thing.  Wouldn't House have to rebuild the sphincters with some part from some other? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, of course, from a child or something.  From a child or something.  Damn it, I've got to save one of them.  House.  All right.  Lonnie Hazard, come here.  Stupid house.  Show's still on.  Sam.  Sam.  Sam is another victim of Lonnie Hazard.  Lonnie Hazard.  Oh, my God.  Well, Quince, I don't know what the matter is.  There is, Sam.  They're finding the same substance in all their underwear.  And Lonnie Hazard is connecting them. 
[01:31:00]  Why don't we understand that this is the work of Lonnie Hazard?  I close my eyes.  I could enjoy the impression that much more.  It's just a perfect Quincey.  He gets all the little inflections.  Lonnie Hazard.  That's right.  Hey, it's Detective Monaghan.  Oh, yeah, Monaghan.  It's always after Quincey.  Lonnie Hazard was accused of flattening a woman's ass with a shovel, and then she wound  up on Quincey's houseboat.  That stupid flat-ass woman. 
[01:31:30]  There's a cardboard cutout, Quince.  He got it from a Victoria's Secret.  Here's a chick there, Quincey.  Oh, hold on.  There you go.  Now her ass is right for you.  That's right.  I like an ass.  She can slide into the door like a pizza box, Sam.  Even Lonnie Hazard doesn't want that ass.  I know.  She was in the hospital, and Lonnie Hazard actually just dropped her off like he should have because  he's an ass man.  Apparently hers was sliced off in a hoeing accident. 
[01:32:00]  Do you get it?  She has a flat ass.  That's in the intro of Quincey, just to help people along there.  When you watch Quincey, go on YouTube and watch a Quincey, and he's like picking this  girl's chubby, awful arm.  He's like picking at it, and you think it's a body until the camera pulls back, and he's  on his disgusting houseboat, or as it's called, Pedarest Island, because he goes out into  international waters and just commits crimes against humanity.  Sam, I don't touch him.  I just take that picture of him that small. 
[01:32:30]  He and the colonel from Boogie Nights, Sam.  It's going to be part of the lost episodes when they put out the box that.  Quincey, the better of the site.  On his creepy houseboat, just off the national shore boundary there.  What do they call that?  International waters.  Quince, they're a little small.  The hands, they make it look so big.  Why is Monaghan with him?  I don't know.  He was on the phone with his bad glasses.  Calling Quincy's creepy houseboat. 
[01:33:00]  Quincy's houseboat stinks.  Dirty cars.  Hands always smell like dead bodies.  Nobody wants to talk to him.  Jeez, Jimmy, that's...  Oh, that is really funny.  We're going to have more tickets to your New Year's Eve show to give away soon.  Oh, are you kidding me?  I'm coming out in a lab coat like Quincy.  That's how I'm bringing in the new year.  Who is this guy?  Oh my God, it's Jimsy.  Jimsy.  That's Jimsy. 
[01:33:30]  That's Jimsy.  That's a big J.  We're heading toward a break.  We got Big A and Twitchels coming in.  Oh, great.  No?  What?  Oh, no Twitchels?  Where is he?  Okay.  On some other show?  All right, who knows.  We'll have Big A do something else then.  We'll poke him with sticks or something.  That was...  Jimsy. 
[01:34:00]  I love that.  New name, obviously.  Yeah.  Going to be Jimsy.  Wait, who called Danny?  Sam.  Twitchels called Danny Stone yesterday?  Oh, we'll have to get into that after the break.  Okay.  It's time now.  I love these things.  Another Grammy moment featuring our own Club Soda County.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Before he cheats, Carrie Underwood.  Glad I dug my key into the side.  With his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive. 
[01:34:30]  Carved my name into his leather seats.  I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires.  Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Cheat.  Cheat.  It was a great delivery. 
[01:35:00]  He did a good job.  He sure did.  I hope so did Kenny, everyone, with his Grammy moments.  And then, can we squeeze this in, you think?  You like that, Jimmy?  You like Club Soda County?  I have to go on break.  I had to tinkle.  He's in one of those alternative relationships there.  Club Soda County.  Yes, he certainly is.  Tim, I got one of these, though, from Than.  What?  It's like an eh.  I got the hand pointing straight out, going back and forth.  Eh. 
[01:35:30]  Eh.  Eh.  That's a mezzo.  You don't like this?  Eh.  Classic O&A staff form.  I have to pass that along to Danny.  He's the one who listened to it.  Oh, really?  That's the review.  That's Danny's review.  Yeah.  Was an eh from our own Tim.  Yeah, but I trust Danny's judgment.  He's trying to, we're trying to, like, do something with the E-Rock audio of him choking  doing that cinnamon challenge.  That's what we got.  Maybe it's good.  Maybe Danny wasn't going eh.  Maybe they were just like, let me see if your hand can be held straight without a drink.  And it was just going back and forth.  Anyway, that's the best I had on that one. 
[01:36:00]  Here it is.  I want to live with a cinnamon girl.  Ah!  I could be happy the rest of my life with a cinnamon girl.  Ah!  Ah!  A dreamer I need you.  All right.  Kind of fit in there a little bit.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  I mean, why is there coughing in there?  What the hell is that?  I think, um, that was supposed to be some sex sounds or something. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Right?  What did you think, E-Rock?  Microphone.  What?  Huh?  It was not good.  When are you going to stop milking this thing, by the way?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, he's just too full of cinnamon to move.  I know.  He's just like, he's moving slowly.  I think he's giving, I think he's purposely doing sick voice at this point.  Yeah, he's got cinnamon eyes.  Yeah, do you notice he's just like this the whole morning?  It's like, ah, my throat. 
[01:37:00]  And his eyes are really effed up from yesterday, but he's, I notice he's like, just giving us  a little squint.  Yeah, yeah.  Just in case we don't notice that his eyes are all messed up.  My eyes are puffy.  You've got capillaries that burst all over your face.  We see.  You're in.  You're doing a hack Clint Eastwood impression.  Yeah.  His squinty eyes and the rugged voice.  Yeah.  Had some cinnamon yesterday.  Anthony, go ahead, make my toast.  Best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony. 
[01:37:30]  It's up on YouTube.  Yeah.  And wow.  Check it out.  You'll love it.  The views are going up.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm looking at Britney Spears.  At one point, I was feeling a little bad for her, and now I just kind of hope she drops  dead.  What an awful mother she is with her pink hair, telling photographers that she's lost going  to the hustler store.  What a pig.  Yeah, she just wants the attention for herself. 
[01:38:00]  She makes me sick.  Her singing is not even good.  I know her CD's bombing.  I'm a big fan of TMZ.  I watch that, and they usually make fun of all the celebrities, and even they are kind  of turning the corner with this whole Britney thing going, wow, man.  Like, who cares?  No, not even who cares.  Like, wow.  Because they said this behavior is because, you know, possibly drugs, right?  But now they're starting to say, they just think she's freaking completely nuts. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, whatever she is.  And then she's just really lonely, and she likes this attention that she's getting, so  now what she does is she just jumps in her car, goes to Starbucks, gets some dumb Starbucks  drink, and just drives around L.A. with no real purpose.  Taunting photographers.  No, no real purpose in mind.  She goes here, she goes there, and they're all like, wow, she's just doing this because  she really likes the attention of the paparazzi following her around.  I've turned the corner on it, too.  I'm convinced she's going to end up dead. 
[01:39:00]  Remember when she was the wholesome one, and Christina Aguilera was the slut, and that  was like the big duo that was battling it out?  Yeah.  Like in the old days of Tiffany, and what's her name?  The one that, oh?  And Debbie Gibson.  Oh, Debbie Gibson.  Which one's going to last, or which one's going to just fizzle out?  By the way, they were both ugly.  Of course.  They try to make them both look pretty hot, but they were both ugly in the end. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, but wow, that's Britney's butt?  What happened to it?  She was just sitting down on a car seat, that's all.  Oh, okay.  There's nothing going on there, really.  Come on.  But yeah, she's in a bad, bad place.  Hey, Jimmy, we're doing that movie screening today?  Yes, we are.  Which movie is it again?  John C. Reilly's film?  Yes.  What's it called?  Walk Hard.  Walk Hard.  What is Walk Hard about?  It's a comedy?  Where's Roland?  Is Roland here yet?  It's Jimmy strolling down at the meatpacking district. 
[01:40:00]  We get a nice opportunity.  We get to go see these movies before they hit movie theaters, because we've got to be prepared  for interviews and stuff, and I believe we're going to have John C. Reilly in studio.  In studio, what?  Next week there, Roland?  Yeah, the 18th.  18th, okay.  And we're doing a screening, so we're informed about his film before he comes in or whatever.  And I hear we could invite some listeners.  Yes.  Because it sees 70 people.  This is an impromptu thing, but I know Jimmy and I are going. 
[01:40:30]  If you want to join us as we watch this, what is it called?  Walk Hard.  Walk Hard.  The story of Dewey Cox.  The story of Dewey Cox.  It's getting pretty good reviews?  Yeah, it's getting really good reviews.  By the people that have seen it so far?  Mm-hmm.  So, what do we tell the people?  It's a very small screening room.  Yeah.  This is one of these impromptu things.  You don't need a ton of promos and, you know, coming up, you're a chance to win.  This is just off the cuff.  Join us if you're in the area, right?  Yeah.  It's on the...  It's out Friday-wide. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's screening 70 people.  Where is it rolling?  550 Madison Avenue.  It's a Sony building.  Madsen?  Wait, what?  Madison.  Madsen.  Madsen.  Madsen.  Is that down in Soho?  Madsen?  Michael Madsen Avenue.  No, it's Midtown.  Where is it rolling?  Seriously.  550 Madison Avenue.  The Sony building.  550?  You're a floor?  Oh, no.  No, if they wait outside, they'll get them in. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, really?  I thought they had to, like, you know, get a window wash and bring them up.  Apply for jobs.  We're 447 stories.  Whatever the case may be.  That guy's still alive.  Yeah.  Still alive.  40 stories, and he's still alive.  Hey, what's the update on that guy?  You washed those windows.  All right.  Yeah, he's probably getting fired because some of the windows were left unwashed.  Yes.  Knowing the building that he was doing, you know, it's a hoity-toity.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Can I just fall on 500 feet?  They're probably pissed because, you know, their window wasn't cleaned.  What did he land on that he's alive?  Not the... 
[01:42:00]  A sidewalk.  Not the bubble wrap.  No, there wasn't a bubble wrap truck.  Supposedly hit the sidewalk, 47 stories.  The sidewalk.  He fell, and he's alive.  And they had it cut open.  We said it yesterday, but his internal injuries are so bad, they actually had to cut open his  body to allow his organs to expand.  To swell.  So he has a chance to survive.  But so far, so far, he's still alive.  But did he just bounce, or did he...  I don't get how his internal...  His brother fell the same day and got cut in half. 
[01:42:30]  No, with him.  Because he hit a...  They fell together.  The same day.  The same day.  What a coincidence.  Right, right, right.  Different part of the town.  But his brother hit a fence and got, you know, sliced in two, basically.  Did he?  Dead.  But this guy, he hit the sidewalk, I guess, and he's still alive.  47 stories.  And he didn't hit anything on the way down or, like, bounce off of...  It wasn't a big cotton convention.  Awning.  Fluffy clouds or something.  Yeah, it's insane.  It's a miracle.  But, Roland, so...  Now, we got about 10 or 12 on staff going, so it's going to be limited seating for some 
[01:43:00]  listeners.  So if you're in the area, you can join us.  What the hell.  All right?  Yep.  Okay.  We'll see you there.  Madison Avenue.  Oh, at noon.  But they got to get there early.  Yeah.  Get there around 1130.  The address one more time?  550 Madison Avenue.  Well, 550.  And it's an avenue?  All right.  He's asking a question.  Is it?  Am I right?  So if you want to see a free movie and you're around Midtown, it's around 1130.  Come join us.  Okay?  All right. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  We got...  We got...  Oh, oh, we should mention this.  Ben Bailey.  Yeah.  Friend of the show.  Sure.  He performs at the Comedy Cellar.  Jimmy knows him very well.  He's done our show a couple times.  Yeah, he's a funny comic.  He does his show on...  I don't know what channel it's on.  I want to say Discovery, my role...  I think it's the same channel as Mythbusters.  Cash Cab.  It's actually really popular.  Yeah, Cash Cab.  Ben Bailey, he's a comedian here in New York City, and he actually got his taxi license.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Just to do this show.  And basically, he picks up unsuspecting people.  Mm-hmm.  And next thing you know, his cab has turned into a game show.  A rolling game show.  A rolling game show.  It's on Discovery Channel.  And you've got to answer trivia questions before you get to your destination, and you  win.  Three strikes, and you're out.  Right, right.  And then it'll just drop you off wherever you are when you get your third strike.  You don't get to go to your destination.  And I take a peek at the show every once in a while, and I like it.  Yeah.  When I do come upon it.  I've seen Cash Ambulance with Lonnie Hazzard. 
[01:44:30]  It's an interesting twist on the game.  He checks your orifices for change like a payphone.  Stupid Lonnie Hazzard.  Lonnie Hazzard is a fantastic...  That's exactly what you need in the EMS industry, is a guy with a sense of humor.  A Lonnie Hazzard.  That's right.  Lonnie Hazzard.  You can't get over that name.  I'm going to be saying it all day.  Oh, my God.  What a goose.  I'm just going to give that out as my name all day. 
[01:45:00]  An old radio bit, yeah.  You come up with names for professions.  Yeah.  Like an eye doctor, and his name is something to do with eyes.  Stevie Wonder.  So, we got a mention on Cash Cab.  That's what we're getting at, and it's on the Discovery Channel.  But we were mentioned yesterday.  Here's your final $100 question.  Synonymous with comedy in the 1990s, prank call artistes Johnny B and Kamal are better known as what? 
[01:45:30]  Opie and Andy.  Andy and Opie.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie and Andy?  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, no.  Strike three.  Ouch.  It's the Jerky Boys.  Nah, I didn't know it.  The Jerky Boys.  Man, that's your third strike, guys. 
[01:46:00]  I didn't know it.  How do you not know the Jerky Boys?  As far as prank callers go.  Yeah.  Opie and Andy?  Andy and Opie.  Opie and Opie.  He finally got on the third try, Opie and Anthony.  But that's kind of cool.  That's always...  I always found that funny, being the answer to anything.  Yeah.  That's like a crossword puzzle.  I'm in the New York Times crossword.  Or Jeopardy.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  I was in the crossword puzzle myself.  Yes, you were.  And then on a game show or something, or Chris Hansen's little Catch the Pedophile show. 
[01:46:30]  Have we played the Chris Hansen in a while?  That's worth another play.  It's very odd to be...  We're becoming part of pop culture, man.  Pop culture.  We were in a Trivia Pursuit game as well, you know.  Ooh.  We're one of the answers in Trivia Pursuit, yeah.  How about that?  I think for the Sex for Sam thing.  The dopes edition?  Someone's got to help me out, but I haven't thought about this in years.  But we are definitely in Trivial Pursuit. 
[01:47:00]  You know, we finally make the game when no one gives a crap about the game.  That's a fun game.  That is a fun game.  We couldn't be part of the game when everybody was buying it and playing it.  Now it's like, oh yeah, they still make that game?  I get so competitive with that game.  Me too.  I need an orange wedge.  And I'm such a faggot.  I can't...  Oh, can I even say that in the context of me not knowing sports?  Yes.  No.  Because gay guys do no sports.  Yeah, well...  So you just insulted everybody. 
[01:47:30]  I know.  That's really bad in this day and age in radio.  You can't insult anyone.  Are you crazy?  What's wrong with you?  I'm being a mad person.  I never can get the sports questions.  Like, unless it's an easy one.  You know?  Joe Nameth.  The answer is Joe Nameth.  What drunk tried to pick up a reporter on the sideline?  Joe Nameth.  Hey, uh...  I'm not good at hockey questions.  No.  No.  Ooh, hockey questions.  Some Russian guy.  I'm a hockey fan.  I can't do the hockey. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I don't know that either.  Hey, we missed the obvious.  Al from Cleveland.  This is why we...  Al!  This is why we acknowledge our listeners, man.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  They make sure we don't miss a thing.  And now I don't know where he is because it updated.  Oh, man.  Al, I'm gonna...  All right, here it is.  How about Ghetto Cab?  You pick up fares at 2 a.m. and ask questions.  If you get questions wrong, you drop them off in Harlem.  Well, you go to ask the first question. 
[01:48:30]  That would be hilarious.  You start in a very safe neighborhood, and as you're getting questions wrong, you keep  going further and further north.  How funny would that be?  Like, ah, I'm sweating.  Ah, humm, humm, humm, humm.  Jesus.  I just wanted to go to TGIF.  Humm, humm, humm, humm, humm, humm.  Or a ghetto cab is they pick you up in the ghetto, and then you go to ask the first question,  and the guy pumps two bullets into your head, takes your money, and your questionnaire. 
[01:49:00]  And your questionnaire.  Hey, ah, another home invasion.  Oh, God.  This one's a good one, though.  This is a fun home invasion.  Are they ever really fun?  Let's see.  A cheerleading squad breaks into your house, takes off everybody's clothing, including their  own, and does their routine, and then leaves you feeling happily completed at the end of  their home invasion.  Yeah, cheerleading squad, coming in and having a panty party, that would be a fun home invasion. 
[01:49:30]  Panty party!  Jimmy, would you like to give another example of a home invasion?  That would be a good home invasion.  That would be a good one.  Panty party!  A good home invasion would be if someone broke in, right, because they had all these freshly  baked cookies they didn't know what to do with, and they broke in and they held you  and your family hostage and made you eat chocolate chip cookies, even though you were trying  to cut back for the holidays, and then they took your garbage out, because they hated 
[01:50:00]  it being there.  Left pleasantly, quietly, with your garbage.  Exactly.  See, good home invasion.  That would be a great home invasion.  Hear about those.  I'm going to say that...  This one, on the scale of cookies, what do you think?  I want to protect myself.  Possibly a good home invasion.  Right?  All right.  Possibly.  The more I read about this one, it could go either way.  Here we go.  An 18-year-old in Ahwatukee is accused of breaking into someone's house, looking at 
[01:50:30]  pornographic pictures on their computer, then taking dirty pictures of himself on their  cell phone.  His explanation to police?  I'm a pervert.  Okay.  Best story of the day, at least.  Could be story of the month.  That is a good one.  I'm a pervert.  Hey, being honest with you, what do you want from me?  I love the news guy has to be serious through the whole thing.  An 18-year-old in Ahwatukee is accused of breaking into someone's house, looking at 
[01:51:00]  pornographic pictures on their computer, then taking dirty pictures of himself on their  cell phone.  His explanation to police?  I'm a pervert.  The second we figured it out, I thought I was going to vomit.  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say...  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say Alani Hazzard broke into the house.  John Montone.  This guy really said she...  She was sleeping.  She was sleeping. 
[01:51:30]  He just interrupts what she said.  Okay.  He was probably there when they were producing the piece.  Okay.  Fade her down here and I'll come in with my VO.  So, she was sleeping.  Good job.  Good job.  Yeah.  Good job.  Could you extend the she a little bit more, though, because we have to get the commercial.  She really was sleeping.  We probably had to start ahead of the microphone.  She was sleeping.  Sam.  She was fast asleep, Sam. 
[01:52:00]  And he came in and took photos with his phone.  She couldn't roll over on her stomach.  She was stuck on her back because of her flat ass, Sam.  Her ass looks like it was taken off by a deli slicer, Sam.  So, what happened?  Gypsy.  Gypsy.  Gypsy.  I love Gypsy.  I have a bunch of bad sweaters with collars.  I'm always getting involved in, like, these mysterious chases. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  I'm just a creepy coroner.  And then you could be at, like, the bar hanging out.  Every woman I have sex with has hair and toenails growing and that's it.  I sleep with all the cold bodies that come through.  You sleep with the dead.  Of course I do.  Little Gypsy.  Gypsy.  Stupid Robert Ito walks in in his homoerotic white coat with a little hole cut in the back  for easy access.  I despise Sam.  I don't know what's ever happened to Robert Ito.  I'll be dying alone and screaming.  What an idiot. 
[01:53:00]  You're an idiot.  There's more on the, uh...  Gypsy.  The pervert.  We figured it out.  I got...  I thought I was going to vomit.  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say 18-year-old Ryan Houghton broke into her Awatuki house  through an unlocked back door, took dirty pictures of himself on her roommate's cell  phone, then looked at pornography on her roommate's computer.  It was sickening.  I remember feeling very nauseous. 
[01:53:30]  All right, we get it.  Jeez.  Upset your tummy.  I thought I was going to vomit.  It was sickening.  I felt nauseous.  I might be acting like you've never almost been raped before.  Oh, wow.  Another roommate wasn't home when it happened, but heard about the burglar with the bizarre 
[01:54:00]  fetish later.  I was just shocked that somebody would actually come into our house and do that.  The girls found evidence someone had used the computer the next morning.  Yes, it was all over the keyboard.  Good work, detective.  Somebody spilled white jam on the X key.  Oh, my keyboard smells like pennies and bleach. 
[01:54:30]  What happened?  The screen is filled up with M's because the M key is stuck.  You're the next morning.  And the cell phone, too.  He made a dirty picture of himself.  The cell phone's wallpaper.  He wanted us now.  He wanted to.  He really wanted that to be seen.  I got a question for Jimmy.  You think this guy likes porn?  This guy doesn't even watch porn occasionally.  Occasionally.  This guy loves it. 
[01:55:00]  I love the fact that he makes his bag her cell phone picture.  The wallpaper on her cell phone.  No matter who calls her, she has to see that.  By the way.  And then he hung wallpaper with what he left all over the keyboard.  People are saying, why didn't we say this for Perv News Thursday?  It was too good to say.  Yeah.  Cell phone's wallpaper.  He wanted us now.  He wanted to get caught.  We could totally tell.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have left all those things behind him. 
[01:55:30]  But police say what he left behind at this house on the streets of Awatsuki helped detectives  catch him, but not before these girls learned an important lesson.  We're vulnerable anywhere we are.  How did she learn that lesson so late in life?  What kind of sheltered existence did she have?  We're vulnerable.  Really?  Wow.  And Santa's not real. 
[01:56:00]  Thought she could just walk around.  I thought there was fairy dust sprinkled on me.  My father told me when I was three that he sprinkled fairy dust on me.  The guardian angel.  That guy is funny, though.  Oh, yeah.  You know what he did.  Because there's not much you can put on a cell phone wallpaper.  You wouldn't do a full-length thing.  You can't hold the camera out that bad.  You've got to be specific.  So you know it was just exactly that that was on her cell phone. 
[01:56:30]  She probably picked it up and just went, oh.  She probably thought it was eel sushi.  Who took a picture of an eel and put it on my phone?  It looks like the Loch Ness Monster, and he's drooling half and half.  Wait a minute.  There's a fleshy shoulder stole.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we've got a smart one here, huh? 
[01:57:00]  All right, listen.  We've got to take a quick break, Jimmy.  It's a thumb with a pith helmet on it.  People are acknowledging you're on fire, but we do have to take a break.  When we get back, we've got a kindergartner that might be expelled for a bomb threat.  Kindergarten?  You could not get expelled in kindergarten unless you killed somebody.  Oh, and they're taking this one seriously.  Zero tolerance policy.  Zero tolerance.  We've got a new Scott and Todd Christmas song worth playing.  I'm sure it's hysterical.  What's it called?  I've had work done?  Jingle all the way?  It is Whippin' on Wednesday. 
[01:57:30]  You know what?  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We didn't even acknowledge that.  Oh, we didn't get to one of those.  We didn't even acknowledge that today.  Maybe we could end the show with one of our classic ones.  Pick a good one, E-Rock.  We'll play that before we get out of here.  Morning Zoo Bit of the Day, we do that on Wednesdays.  Maybe we'll get to the Scott and Todd awful Christmas song that they think is good.  And, you know, I was going to blow this off, but Hotel Glasses, they did this story here in New York recently on the news.  Oh, right.  And how they're not clean. 
[01:58:00]  And I'm like, whatever.  Dirty glasses.  Who cares?  I hate those stories.  I looked more into it, and the crap you could catch from a hotel glass is frightening.  From just a glass.  I don't like stories about what's in hotels, what's on the blanket.  Everyone knows to just take that bedspread off the bed because they don't wash it or something is the rumor.  Well, wait till you hear about the glasses if you haven't heard yet what you could get.  What do you think you could get from a glass, a dirty glass?  I don't know.  Probably.  AIDS?  I'm going to guess a cold of some sort. 
[01:58:30]  I'm going to guess maybe a herpes, but I don't know how, like if your lip touches where the lip was in the glass.  I don't know about that.  Maybe shards of glass in your mouth if it's broken.  It gets punched while you're drinking.  Exactly.  For being lippy.  Or maybe if there's like some kind of knockout juice in it and Lonnie Hazzard comes, you can get a sore hiney from a hotel glass.  Well, I'm going to do my job right now.  We're going to tell you after the break.  Oh, we'll tease.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Me and Howie Mandel.  Stupid Howie Mandel.  Stop.  Stop teasing through commercials.  Just do the show.  Open the case for God's sake.  Nah, he's actually brilliant at it.  And also, we'll do What Did You Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show next.  Lots still to do.  Stay there.  Getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I like this.  We did a lot of stuff today, man.  Yeah, who is this?  I'm going to guess.  What? 
[01:59:30]  Back from the System of the Down.  That's what I'm guessing.  Oh, really?  You would have guessed that?  I swear to God.  Is this the guy with the long beard?  Yeah.  He's a drummer, right?  No, he's a singer.  He's a drummer, man.  Syndrome of the Down.  That's my favorite.  Oh, that's funny.  Where the hell is that from?  I don't know.  It was said once before on this show and had me almost going to the bathroom on myself.  Did you just linger longer?  Yes, I lingered longer. 
[02:00:00]  It is Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  We got Danielle from Iowa.  We can take these calls every week, but we're a bit busy these days.  We're a bit busy with our radio show, but Danielle wants to share.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Oh, Daniel.  All right.  What's up, Daniel?  Oh, man.  You don't need the lingerie.  All you need is Opie and Anthony and Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  I've been kind of in this girl for maybe a year, just kind of kissing and whatever, and I walked into the office this morning before anybody was there, and she said, you know what day it is? 
[02:00:30]  And I said, yeah, it's Wednesday, and she said, no, it's Opie and Anthony Day, and raised her shirt.  Nice.  Look at that.  Opie and Anthony Day.  Or Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  Whatever.  That's fine.  By the time it was over, there was no papers or phone or stapler or anything on her desk except us.  You guys did the nasty at work?  We did the nasty before anybody got to work. 
[02:01:00]  Are you married?  Well, yeah.  And I assume not to her.  It was, no.  Well, there you go.  Jimmy, you got a question for this guy, you think?  No, not at all.  I just thought it was.  No, not at all.  I knew when he said she whipped it out.  It wasn't a book.  I'm just kidding.  He likes you, though.  I like his number.  How do you feel about the Jimmy Dean's sausage going down to a smaller size? 
[02:01:30]  They need to raise it back up.  12 ounces ain't enough.  You can't feed four people.  You can't feed four people.  I love when the guy's trying to describe the fat pig that he married.  He goes, she's a plump girl.  A plump girl.  She's what again?  She's a...  Scottish.  Scottish.  Plump.  She's plump.  She's a fat Scot.  And what does she say?  No, no, no.  Make the money.  Make the money.  Make more money.  My wife is beautiful, but this girl is just drop-dead gorgeous. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  Congratulations to you.  You got a little something because of the show.  And whip them out Wednesday.  All right.  Yeah, get the WOW stickers or the WOW signs or write it in the dirt in the back of your car.  This WOW thing definitely does work.  There are women out there.  They see it.  They're fans of the show.  They will flash you.  So if you see a woman and she doesn't feel like flashing you, you just move on with your  life.  Yes.  But there are plenty of women out there that will do it.  They do it every Wednesday on Pal Talk for us right here in the studio. 
[02:02:30]  Okay.  It is the Christmas season.  And we're too lazy to actually come up with an Opie and Anthony Christmas song.  So why not play somebody else's?  Why not play Scott and Todd's?  The big morning show here in New York City.  Setting the radio world on fire.  How many frigging people are there on that show?  About 15.  My God.  Scott and Todd in the morning.  Oh, we'll give them a plug.  Yuck. 
[02:03:00]  And this is a good test, by the way.  We like to test our listeners every once in a while.  We're going to play something right now.  It's called Have a Roly-Poly Christmas.  Uh-huh.  And if you find yourself chuckling, laughing, enjoying this thing, and not because of what  we do with the song, then I think you might want to change the dial.  That's right.  This show isn't for you.  Or take a big handful of cinnamon and eat it. 
[02:03:30]  Throw yourself down an elevator shaft.  Oh.  Look at what they did.  They made an animation with all their heads on it of them in little elf outfits doing  these wacky little dance.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  Can we do the same thing?  Oh, my God.  But we want to be nude.  They have dancing elves on their website.  Abusing each other.  That would be funny.  For fruity elves.  Ugh.  Well.  I'll be happy to catch G.H.  Hey, Sam. 
[02:04:00]  What do you got on Scott and Todd on this awful song?  Oh, I was just listening the other day just because sometimes I like to listen to Scott  and Todd.  And she laughs, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It just helps me get the humor back in the morning.  And I heard Roly-Poly Christmas and thought you guys might want to listen to it as well.  You got a chuckle from it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was very funny.  Oh, wow.  It is our morning zoo bit of the day.  Yes.  And I think we only get bits from Scott and Todd at this point.  Well, they are just a goldmine. 
[02:04:30]  They have a plethora.  Yeah.  Plethora.  Of morning zoo bits to choose from.  Here's Have a Roly-Poly Christmas.  Listen to this.  Merry Christmas!  Sam's dancing.  Have a Roly-Poly Christmas.  Eating everything inside.  Oh, I get it.  Because people get fatter on the holidays.  I was wondering what the theme was going to be.  Whoa, whoa, hey.  That's a little edgy, though, because there are people, I'm sure they wanted to do the 
[02:05:00]  song, but yet be sensitive to people that are overweight, because we all come in different  shapes and sizes, and that's what makes us diverse.  I agree.  I couldn't agree more.  And I just want to make sure that this one doesn't go a little too far.  These guys are known for going a little too far, and I just want to monitor this one.  I bet there's going to be a lot of food references.  These guys like to eat, don't they?  Mike gained a few pounds during the holiday.  Roly-Poly, too big to even walk, are you?  But we don't want to, no.  Come on now.  We don't want to make fun of people that are overweight. 
[02:05:30]  I don't even consider it overweight.  It's just a different size body.  We're all, it's a diverse nation.  We should address that and celebrate it with songs like Roly-Poly Christmas.  And by the way, let's look at the positive.  You're not overweight.  You're small for a planet.  Isn't that the truth?  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:00]  Cakes and pies go to your thighs.  Isn't that the truth?  That's true.  And apparently a little surgery goes to your eyes.  Make you look younger, doesn't it?  I'd have to unlisten that belt buckle around the holidays.  Whoa, hey, hey.  Cakes and pies go to your thighs.  That's funny.  Have a Roly-Poly Christmas as Lonnie Hazard flips you around.  Good gosh.  Good gravy.  Cakes and pies go to your thighs, and the formaldehyde rag goes over your eyes. 
[02:06:30]  I almost tripped over that one.  Formaldehyde rag.  Tough to get out when you're singing, folks.  Have a Roly-Poly Christmas.  Everybody.  Is the whole thing you don't pop.  Oh.  Oh.  Red pudding and red icing.  You try, but you can't stop.  Mm-hmm.  Moo, moo.  The dress you wear, cause nothing will fit.  This time of year you need...  This song sounds like s**t. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, boy.  That's right.  We're making fun of you.  You stink.  He looks like droopy dog.  He's got like...  I don't know what's going on.  I don't know.  How big does your head actually get when you get older?  He's awful.  His eyes are like 25, and the rest of his face is like 60.  How does that happen?  He's a young man's eyes. 
[02:07:30]  Nothing will fit.  Stop it, stop it.  Thank you.  Oh, you just wanted it stopped.  Okay.  But there's plenty of fat references still to get to.  Oh, there are more.  Yeah.  Holy, Polly, folks.  Pull over.  Here it comes.  Gotta be careful around the hall.  Don't eat too much, folks.  Whop like a balloon, but you won't float away.  Why?  Because you're a fat pig.  Nothing will fit.  This time of year. 
[02:08:00]  You need two chairs when you sit.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  Because you won't fit in one because your ass is fat.  Or don't move to the Middle East or they'll cut off your...  Can we say this?  You're a woman.  You're a f***er.  Have a roly-poly Christmas.  Oh, that's good.  I get it.  We eat too much around the hallways.  Yeah.  Have a roly-poly Christmas.  Eat the fruitcake. 
[02:08:30]  What the hell?  Because there's no laws and Mr. Santa Claus can make an XL.  Wow.  What is that called?  Shoehorning?  Shoehorn those words in.  He shoehorned those.  Shoehorn them in.  But they're celebrating diversity.  XL.  Poo, poo, platter for lunch.  Stretch marks in your guts.  By Christmas Day you'll look like Jabba the Hutt.  Oh, wow.  That's not bad.  A 20-year-old reference. 
[02:09:00]  I like Jabba the Hutt.  Jabba the Hutt.  Jabba the Hutt.  Jabba.  Like Fatty Arbuckle.  With a Coke bottle Fatty Arbuckle.  Like Caesar's Fat Assistant.  Almighty.  Wow.  Can we hear the Jabba the Hutt line?  How awful he stretches out?  Jabba the Hutt.  He had a stroke in the middle of the line.  Please stop.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:09:30]  Who's trying to rhyme scheme with the word Hutt at this point?  Oh, well.  Yeah, there's a few.  Pooh, poo, platter for lunch.  Stretch marks in your guts.  By Christmas Day you'll look like Jabba the Hutt.  Have a rollie.  He actually turned Jabba into a five-stable word.  Jabba the Hutt.  Sadly, Paul Linde. 
[02:10:00]  Wait for our next hit.  Walking in a c***er wonderland.  Celebrating diversity.  No matter, we can build a bro-man.  All right.  Holy Christmas.  Being skinny's not so great.  It's more fun to say you're done and show your empty plates.  Have a roly-poly Christmas.  Get the sugar in your veins. 
[02:10:30]  Eat tons of grams of freaking yams and suck down candy canes.  Oh, is that it?  What?  I see you packing up.  Oh, well.  You can't.  What do you say after this?  How do you follow?  What do you say after you work the word yams into a song?  Yams?  What the F eats yams, you dope? 
[02:11:00]  Just because the word fits doesn't mean you use it.  Oh, ho.  Yams.  Mm-hmm.  Yams.  Stew, stew, the fast food joins today.  Forget your cheese.  No!  Remember that your goal is stomach by your knees.  Yeah!  Have a roly-poly Christmas.  Get a fat roll neath your nuts.  Eat cookies and you and monkeys and a gingerbread house.  Smash the bathroom scale with your body mass. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, what?  Uh-oh.  Ass?  Ask your family when you pass them.  Yeah, a little fight.  Little, make a little fart.  Yeah!  Have a roly-poly Christmas.  It's the best time of the year.  Yeah.  Eat and drink until you get a big stand of claws.  Size rear.  Rear.  That's funny.  Merry Christmas.  Hey, Scott and Josh.  Say, what a... 
[02:12:00]  Goodness gracious.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  They're all laughing at the roly-poly jokes.  They're making yam references.  They're all independent smiling.  Oh, Posada knew the fat jokes were coming.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, hey, this is Roger Clare.  I'll be a little roly-poly.  Rhyme with...  Ha-ha-ha-hut.  Ha-ha-hut.  Wow.  Ah, that's fantastic. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, God bless you guys.  God bless.  They've been doing morning radio forever.  I don't know why with that crap.  Who laughs at that on the way to work?  I don't know.  I don't know!  Santa Claus size rear.  That's a big and...  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Funny.  Good break, Sam.  Funny stuff.  All right.  Well, there's Pete from New Jersey.  He's hoping that Scott and Todd try to invade Ant's home in the near future.  Yeah, yeah.  Roly and poly-ing down the stairs. 
[02:13:00]  Holding their roly-poly guts.  Well, we didn't get to what did we learn on the show today.  That means...  We didn't learn anything, right?  That means we didn't need filler today, so that's a good sign for us.  Hey, best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  That sounds a little weird.  I don't like that.  Yeah, it sounds a little weird when you read it like that.  Oh-ho.  It's on YouTube.  The video is getting viewed.  This is a biggie, folks.  It's a biggie.  E-Rock almost died yesterday.  Check it out for yourself.  Best cinnamon challenge ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony on YouTube. 
[02:13:30]  Okay?  Right.  We're off to XM.  You guys, um...  Come back tomorrow and listen to us again for our ratings.  Why would they come back to this, Jimmy?  Why?  Because...  Why?  Because it's been a long time since you were able to get Quincy references in this town.  Sam.  And if you want more Quincy references, tomorrow from the 7 to 8.30 hour, it's going to be  a bunch of Quincy...  Like, Quincy as a dentist, Quincy as an eye doctor, Quincy as an ENT. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Quincy as, like, a gas station tenant.  Of course.  You can see Quincy in so many situations.  Yeah, they're all funny, too.  Yeah.  All right.  All of them.  Ah.  Hmm.  Ah.  Well, let's, uh...  Let's, um...  Go and do, uh...  Our other, uh...  Thing.  I say we just go home.  All right.  Let's do that.  It's fine by me.  Oh, I think I saw Boo!  Oh, my God!  God damn!  Whip him out Wednesday! 
[02:14:30]  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Scott and Todd have a choking video, too.  It's Todd choking on Scott's roly-poly cock after recording their song.  Yeah, it doesn't take long from the time we get here.  So the throwing out of the first cock.  Again, it's a cock mode.  Cock.  We're in cock mode.  I think they dumped out of the word teeny weenie.  Yeah, teeny weenie.  I can't say teeny weenie. 
[02:18:30]  I can't say teeny weenie.  I can't say teeny weenie.  I can't say teeny weenie.  I can't say teeny weenie.  Get us male listeners.  I can't say weenie.  Well, that was a little tough when we were watching the Brazilian tribe there, and everyone's naked, and the girls have fine, firm bosoms.  And I had a very good thought, but I couldn't figure out how to say it on regular radio, because we were acknowledging that some of these tribesmen had some fine cocks on them.  You could just tell by the pixelation that was going on.  Yeah, how long the pixelation was down at their knees.  And I was trying to say that how funny would it be if in that culture, that tribe, having a big, huge cock is actually a bad thing, and they openly look at you, and they openly laugh at you. 
[02:19:00]  They laugh.  Look at the big cock guy.  And if you had a tiny one, a tiny cock, that you were considered like a god, and the girls were just freaking getting wet instantly because of your tiny cock.  Because it just, that's just how it.  Anyway, let's go to Nate in Iowa.  Teeny weenie.  That's too racy. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, teeny weenie.  Can't say teeny weenie.  Well, wow.  And I was going to say teeny weenie junk, teeny weenie cock.  You can't say a small penis?  But I think they, uh...  No, you can't describe any of the organs.  Cock meant weenie.  Oh, and faggot got dumped out.  Size, moisture, and faggot.  Why did faggot get dumped?  And it was in, the context I was using it was ridiculous.  I would have left this in, but Opie then said,  Gay people know sports too. 
[02:20:00]  Well, that didn't...  What?  Oh, blame it on me.  Ah, ha, ha, I'm clean.  Oh, this guy doesn't have much time.  This guy named, uh...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry to hear.  Oh, Jesus.  Nate in Iowa, what's up?  Yeah, I think you guys need to crack a Lopweiser for Scott and Todd.  Yeah, I do believe they earned a Lopweiser today with that roly-poly Christmas song.  Yeah, crack one for them.  There you go.  Ah, there it is.  That one's for Scott, and that one's for Todd.  Yeah, Lopweiser.  Lopweiser. 
[02:20:30]  Wow.  Fucking A, Jimmy.  Nice.  Doing anal shots with each other.  Have a Lopweiser.  Uh, Elo.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Speaking of Lopweisers, do you have any comment on, uh...  Eh...  I comment on what...  I've been trained so well, I can't answer that question.  I stopped myself.  I'm showing restraint.  Let's just put it that way.  Understood.  Hi, Elo.  Some of that fine inside info I get from Elo is too good for the radio, and then you realize, 
[02:21:00]  well, do you really want to blow up your career?  No.  No, I know.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Did you change your cell phone?  I tried calling you a couple times, and it goes to some bizarre voicemail box.  Really?  Yeah.  My cell phone?  Yeah.  Is it the one that I have?  I always answer for the Elo.  Wait, let me...  All right.  Try to call me right now, see what happens.  No, I was calling you from the office number, so who knows, it could be some jacked up thing.  My phone didn't change, and I haven't gotten a call from you, have I?  No.  Bobby, is that you? 
[02:21:30]  Bobby.  Bobby.  You are a bastard.  I'm sorry.  Do you want to check Gantt's cell number?  Make sure it's right?  Well, I wouldn't give it out on the air.  Let me dial it here.  All right.  Do you have...  Let me see.  Which one do you want me to give a minute?  No, I mean...  Here, I'll just...  I'll dial the one right here.  I got it in a little...  Let's see.  All right.  Turn my ringer on. 
[02:22:00]  Do you have...  Let's compare.  Do you have nine ones?  Hey, hey.  What?  We can't be just giving out my cell phone number.  Oh.  Okay.  There it is.  There's my ring.  Elo's a liar!  Hello, Eric.  You're...  I just hung up on you.  Oh, the son of a bitch hung up on me.  Who the hell was that?  I can't talk very long.  Oh, you can't talk very long?  Wow.  You are a liar.  Holy Jesus.  What?  You got to get down to Kinko's? 
[02:22:30]  Resumes to print are expensive, especially on high-quality stock paper.  As we laugh, hold a space in line for us.  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  Goddamn liar!  You didn't try calling Anthony.  No, I did.  I did.  No, you didn't.  I did.  You wanted to.  I dialed it from my desk phone here.  Or Monday and Tuesday when I was trying to give him the updated news that I gave you,  Opie.  See, that's odd because it comes up and it says, Logan.  Well, that was from my cell phone, but when I called from my desk... 
[02:23:00]  Oh, sometimes if something comes up and it says, Blocked or something, I don't even answer it.  Ah, that's what it is.  So if you're blocked, you call me with your cell phone because then it comes up and a big  bottle of whiskey comes up as a picture icon, so I know it's you.  A car wrapped around a pole is my picture icon.  With a Billy Joel song playing.  Oh, this is Jim Norton.  I sometimes sit in the opening athlete program.  Hello, Mr. Logan.  I've got a call for you. 
[02:23:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sitting here.  I couldn't...  Logan...  I got this call from Bob Kelly on my cell phone, I think it was.  Oh, what does he want you to play that call?  What the...  Oh, fuck.  I can't even remember the fucking name of the...  No, Jim just called me.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All of duty.  Thank you.  Logan, two days ago you called me with this great news...  On a call of heroes?  What?  What the fuck?  About podcasts and XM and iTunes.  And during the phone call with me, when did you realize that I didn't give a shit?  Oh.  Wow. 
[02:24:00]  Somewhere early on.  That's why the call was over pretty quick.  That, uh...  That is in part, yes.  Oh, that's great.  I mean, this is always a hell sign with Opie.  Oh, that's great.  Fantastic.  Good stuff.  I was lining up a 20-foot fucking putt, Target Woods 08, and you're calling and I'm getting  distracted.  I know.  With your big news with iTunes and the podcast.  Which actually, his answer, by the way, Anthony, was, I gotta go, there's food at the door.  Oh, okay.  Food at the door is code for I'm putting.  Leave me alone.  Food at the door is hand me my sandwich. 
[02:24:30]  This show goes through phases where we get completely engrossed in video games.  We're in one of those phases right now.  The entire program.  I couldn't have told by the gay G-A-A-Y troop with Bob Kelly and Call of Duty or anything.  His clan.  Get it right.  You know, there is no way I would join that just because I'm not putting that in front  of my name.  I want to be a cool, I want to be in a cool clan.  Not the gay clan.  The way I ordered it would be after hearing it because I have Call of Duty 3, but I don't  have 4.  4 is amazing. 
[02:25:00]  You'll love it.  You'll have plenty of time to play it.  It'll be great.  Elo.  Elo, you ever do any of that whoop, whoop?  Do you whoot when you kill people?  No.  Fuck.  That's leet speak.  Yeah.  No.  The other thing I hate is guys, you know the other thing about those melee rooms that  I hate, not that we should turn this into a gaming segment, boring, but I hate people  who go in there with their cheats to show off how good their cheats are.  It's like, no cheats, use a Colt 45 and like, you know, that's not like, oh, I can jump  40 feet in the air and turn invisible. 
[02:25:30]  It's like stupid.  How's the merger?  What merger?  Attaboy.  Yeah.  It ain't happening.  What do you mean?  You heard it here first.  No, stop.  Tell them.  Stop it.  Tell them.  Tell them.  Tell them.  What?  What?  What?  What?  More sounds of you driving home at night?  I can't do that with my car collection.  It's very expensive now. 
[02:26:00]  Elo's whoot, whoot as he's barreling over pedestrians on the way home.  That's right.  On a late Friday night.  Hey, Elo, that merger thing, I have no idea, to be quite honest with you.  Uh, podcast, where are we at with iTunes and all that?  What's the big news?  If you go to iTunes now, we are on the front page of iTunes.  That is cool, man.  Let me see that.  If you go to iTunes and then there's a tile at the very, very top that when you click on  it, it comes up XM and then you click on the XM icon, you can subscribe to a variety 
[02:26:30]  of podcasts of which one of them is the Opie and Anthony shorts, which are CokeLogic videos  that we will now be pushing out on a regular basis that people can download for their iPhone,  which look really amazing on the iPhone, by the way, and also the Nano video or any other  MP3 device you have.  A bit of an observation from the Opie and Anthony camp.  We get an animated short, Bob Edwards gets best of Bob Edwards.  There you go.  Comment?  Comment?  Comment?  Comment?  Comment? 
[02:27:00]  Well, I can tell you which one's being downloaded more, if that makes a difference.  We get a minute.  Bob Edwards gets, what, 60 minutes?  Comment?  It's a minute.  It feels like 60.  Comment?  Well, what I would simply say is, you can accomplish more in three minutes than somebody  can accomplish in 60.  Let's go inside this deal, though.  What were you scared of?  Our content with the Apple people?  No, I wasn't scared.  No, actually, there's no issue with the content at all, by the way.  Comment?  Comment, comment, please.  It's expensive to animate. 
[02:27:30]  What the hell are we doing?  You paid by the minutes.  Making a Simpsons episode or something?  Which one did they animate?  Where is it?  Can we see it?  It's great.  The first one is you asking Bob De Niro, Robert De Niro.  Oh, that one's really good.  Oh, cool.  So there must be some residual money coming in, right?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, Jimmy, that is correct if the agent who negotiated all the deals for the  show actually had the appropriate rights in there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, here it is.  This is, that's right on the iTunes website today. 
[02:28:00]  It's an animation, but it's still a funny bit to hear as well.  So, I'm at Tavern on the Green.  I don't want to yank my camera out because I don't want to get thrown out.  How's he shirt?  I don't want to get the camera out, and I see Robert De Niro standing there, and I've  never seen Robert De Niro in person, and it floors me.  Dude, De Niro.  So I walk up behind him, and I tap his arm.  Oh, no.  I, I, I, I don't tap De Niro ever. 
[02:28:30]  And I said, Bob?  Oh, my God.  I called him Bob.  I called him, I called De Niro Bob.  He turns around.  I was so speechless that it was De Niro.  So I just go, I'm a big fan.  Can I get a picture?  And he said no.  Oh, no.  It's the first, the first celebrity turn down ever.  I'm amazed you're still alive.  He said to me, he goes, nah, I'm just trying to see Billy.  He's like, and if I take one, everybody's going to start asking me, and it's like, I 
[02:29:00]  knew he was being truthful.  He wasn't being a prick.  Oh, boy.  That's, uh, that's the funny, that's the funny.  He just didn't want to have everybody take photos.  Jimmy, next time you're in a room with Bobby De Niro, you get a picture.  I guess he probably just didn't want to start a frenzy.  Yeah.  But he was nice about it.  You are Rupert Pupkin.  You are, you are Rupert Pupkin.  Exactly.  Yeah, well, it's choppy and all over the place.  It's buffering.  It's buffering.  Is that what was happening?  You got a buffer. 
[02:29:30]  It's buffering.  Coke Logic did a great job with that animation, and it's featured on the front page of iTunes  today.  Yeah, and if you subscribe to the podcast, we're going to push out a new one of those automatically  to all the podcast subscribers every two or three days.  We've got three more lined up, and I think the next one, one of them is the insensitivity  training, Jimmy, with you from a few years ago.  That was a good one.  And then Anthony, the New Jersey Tornado Chaser is one of them.  All right, okay. 
[02:30:00]  So, I mean, there's some good ones, and then we just got another slate of audio in, and  we're getting those animated, so it'll be good.  Very good.  There you go.  Yeah, so it's exciting.  And then, you know, the great thing is that, you know, Apple's doing a huge promotion  for us, so we're real excited about that.  Yeah, that's absolutely cool.  Good people to get into bed with.  What are some of the other podcasts you can download from XM?  Okay, are you hanging up now or later?  No, he's actually...  No, this is big news.  I've got to help you out.  Okay, I need all the help I can get. 
[02:30:30]  But we've got a music podcast with Billy Zero, your friend Bob Edwards, Artist Confidential.  Bob Edwards.  Ooh.  Be nice.  Wait, you can download Artist Confidential right to your iPhone?  You can get...  You can download the Green Room.  It's a five-minute sample of Artist Confidential.  The first episode is Def Leppard.  So what is it?  Them just talking and a little taste of their music?  You got it.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  And when you download the Bob Edwards one, that's pretty cool. 
[02:31:00]  It's probably like...  You can download it like that with the wind and the ocean sounds if you're tired.  Stop it.  I'm not knocking Bob Edwards.  Yes, listen to my coffin cast.  Be nice.  No?  It's like a pod.  Oh, you know he sucks.  Wooden coffin.  Let's be honest.  Hold on.  I'll give him one back.  Love a sound effect battle.  We're even.  You should at least acknowledge it wasn't your deal.  It's not my deal, Wade. 
[02:31:30]  That wasn't your deal.  That wasn't my deal.  That was before me.  Hey, Elo.  That's a really good news thing, right?  It's a great news thing.  It was good.  It was very exciting.  My fee.  And then you got what?  Some sports podcasts.  Coach K.  Coach K is his podcast.  James Carville, Barry Switzer.  We will have up an unmasked podcast later today, which will have a seven-minute clip of Carlin. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, nice.  And these are all free, by the way.  George?  What is that?  Nothing.  What's the Opie and Anthony experience?  Those were...  Tedious.  Those are...  Jimmy Norton.  God damn you.  I can't top that.  I got to go.  No.  What is the Opie?  There's two things on there. 
[02:32:30]  You got the Opie and Anthony shorts, and then there's something called the Opie and Anthony  experience.  Those were test videos of bootleg versions that people were putting up of PalTalk.  And that was not put up by us.  Oh, okay.  So what does that mean?  It's just stuff up there.  It's under the XM podcast page, but it wasn't put up by XM.  If you look at...  Yeah, that's what that was.  And if you search under XM, there's a lot of other stuff. 
[02:33:00]  If you just search under XM, under iTunes, there's a lot of other stuff there as well.  Yeah, people put stuff up.  All right.  And iTunes is going to feature XM for the next week on their front page?  Yep, on there on front page, in the front page of the podcast section, and then we  have our own dedicated page within iTunes, which you can get to.  So wait, people go there to iTunes, and they go to that front page, and they can download  our stuff.  The more they download the Opie and Anthony stuff, the more Opie and Anthony stuff that  will probably be up there, because iTunes or whatever app we'll see are shit getting 
[02:33:30]  downloaded.  So if the listeners want to do that, that would be great.  It would be fantastic if all the Opie and Anthony fans would subscribe to all of these  or specifically the animated ones.  No, just the animated ones.  We want to look like superstars.  And I will be able to tell you guys probably tomorrow what is the most downloaded podcast  when I get my first report.  How many do you think?  Let's pretend we don't know what that one's going to be.  Let's pretend.  Bob Edwards is leading the way right now.  Is he really?  No, he's not. 
[02:34:00]  We haven't even mentioned it yet.  Well, that's probably why.  Well, NPR is one of the most downloaded podcasts on iTunes, by the way.  Is it?  When people fall on their keys when they fall asleep?  No, I'm sure Bob Edwards is good at what he does.  I mean, it's just not our particular...  It's not your cup of tea.  Exactly.  It's not my cup of NyQuil.  Way to wreck Jimmy's bit, by the way, Elo.  That was a damn good one.  Thank you, sir.  It's not my cup of blood. 
[02:34:30]  Stop it.  Are we going to get downloaded, though?  Are you going to get downloaded?  Yeah, because the De Niro one I like, but there's other ones I like better than that  one.  I think that one's like...  Because, you know, it's kind of clean.  Yes.  Yeah, yes.  What do you want?  All right.  You don't have to humiliate me.  This is a good thing for us.  It's a good thing for you guys.  I know it is.  Why is everybody screaming at me?  Elo, what can you tell us about the merger? 
[02:35:00]  Anything?  Yeah, any news.  Anything.  The Mitchell Report's coming out tomorrow.  That'll be fun.  The Mitchell Report.  What the hell's that?  Well, that's a report by Mitchell.  Bob Mitchell?  I would think.  No, it's Mitchell and Murray.  Or is it George?  Mitchell.  What does that mean?  The steroids.  The steroids report's tomorrow.  That's the big news down here.  Yeah.  Many, many players, both playing at this time and retired.  60 to 80 is what they're saying.  Involved in this report. 
[02:35:30]  The steroids report.  They say it's going to be 1,400 pages, so.  And what?  They're just going to name 60 to 80 players?  Yeah.  Yep.  Current and former.  They said they're named in it.  It doesn't, I don't think that means that all of them are doing steroids.  I mean, you know, some might know people.  Is it going to be, is it really going to be a surprise at this point when you see a name  on that list go, oh, wow.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  When Jason Giambi's name is on the list, I don't think anybody's going to drive off  the road.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Let them do whatever the fuck they want.  Language.  I love 600-foot homers. 
[02:36:00]  I don't care they get tumors because they're hitting 600-foot homers.  They're knocking tumors out of the stadium.  I could kill less.  They fly out of their arms.  Yeah.  Cut the...  A young fan catches a tumor.  Yeah.  Cut the tumors out of their heads and give it to the pitcher for the next inning to throw.  Oh, I don't care.  And then hit the tumors out of the stadium.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Well, I miss talking to you, Elo.  Well, I'm always here.  I'm waiting for my baby to get here, so...  Can you imagine if they cleaned up... 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  Don?  Don Wicklin.  In that little diaper.  No, he said that affectionately, like his broad.  Oh, my baby.  Sweet Don.  My little baby.  He likes when Don puts like a bouffant wig on.  So does Don.  Yes.  Come on.  He's wearing a pink dress today.  Answer this.  Who's Don kidding?  Apparently, his wife.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  We kid Don.  We know he's gay, but we kid him.  What's the big meeting today?  Big meeting today?  Let's look at the old calendar here.  I have...  No, you were in a meeting when we called you.  Who were you meeting with?  That was to renew a deal that we don't have any money to renew, so we were just trying  to figure out how to gracefully tell him no.  Please, I hope you weren't talking to Bob Eatman.  Let's see.  I got country meetings.  I got an urban content meeting. 
[02:37:30]  I got an EPG meeting.  Urban content meeting.  That sounds interesting.  Is that a problem?  Are you going to be speaking with people about rap lyrics and whatnot?  Yeah, exactly.  Really?  Ask them to move the gun chat from Love...  Gun chat.  Gun chat.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Baby, gun chat.  Elo just crashed you.  Now, who are you speaking with?  Leaders?  Urban leaders?  No, no, no.  It's our programmers.  Oh, programmers.  So, are you going to be telling them to maybe play different versions of songs? 
[02:38:00]  What's that?  Are you going to tell them to play different versions of songs?  Ones without gunfire or bitches in it?  No, this is about how we can just other shows we can sign and stuff, so it's nothing major.  Oh, because I like when they talk about bitches.  Hey, Jimmy, by the way, I just got a text message to communicate in.  Are you in Minneapolis in March?  I think so.  Yeah, I have a tour that just went on sale.  Why are you going to be there?  Yeah, I may come up to my brother's one's ticket, so...  All right, well, I'll be the ticket master. 
[02:38:30]  So, why don't you answer?  I'll give you his cell phone.  You can call him and just say, here's the number, call.  That'd be hilarious.  You didn't answer Anthony's question.  What?  I'm sorry, Anthony.  So, basically, you're admitting that there's censorship involved with XM.  Oh, no, no, no.  This has nothing to do with it.  This is about what personality you want to hire.  They can play whatever they want to play.  I believe that.  Do you?  Yes, of course.  Do you?  I love the Programmer Rack Channel.  Put all Sabbath songs on it.  Just watch people get pissed off. 
[02:39:00]  Fucking annoy everybody.  Who got the smoothies today?  Kenny, why?  What's wrong with your smoothie, Anthony?  It's thin and piss warm.  Oh, yuck.  It's thin.  It's like watery.  I want a smoothie to taste like it should have like a frozen drink.  You want it to taste like cum.  No, this is cum.  What?  I have a full fucking cup.  What?  It's three men, one cup right here. 
[02:39:30]  This is awful.  It's warm and it's thin.  Look how runny it is, Kenny.  Feel that smoothie, Kenny.  Look how runny it is.  What happened?  I'll take care of them.  Sorry that that happened.  Oh, don't be sorry, Kenny, because I know it's not your fault.  Kenny's doing everyone's job today.  And Pat Duffy brought it in.  Where did he take possession of said smoothie?  Oof.  Probably from Pat from Unaki's stomach.  Oh.  Yeah, he'll be right back.  Did he go down to get the smoothie or did you get the smoothie? 
[02:40:00]  No, Pat Duffy got the smoothie.  Oh, so that's why it sucks ass.  All right.  Now it makes sense.  Kenny, you usually check things like this.  Yes.  Are you feeling okay?  Don't worry.  It's not your fault.  What are you doing?  It's Pat Duffy's fault for giving me a subpar smoothie.  Well, because like it's the general's fault if a private gets shot out in the battlefield.  Technically, it's not.  It's the private's fault for sticking his ass out of the foxhole too far.  What are you doing?  I still take responsibility. 
[02:40:30]  Were you too busy ironing your electric blue shirt to monitor this electric blue?  Elo's killing us.  Elo hit us with the boring button.  Boring.  But here's the deal.  Elo, you take responsibility.  What does that mean?  Does that mean Jimmy gets to spank you?  If he'd like.  Jimmy, would you like to spank Kenny if he pulls down his big boy underpants?  More than I want to breathe, I'd love to spank Kenny.  I would love to spank Kenny.  Can Jimmy spank you if you keep your big boy underpants on? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, hey, by the way, if you do it, we'll put it on iTunes.  Whatever you want.  Oh, iTunes.  It'll be up on iTunes.  Oh, so we can throw other stuff up on iTunes eventually.  Yeah, eventually.  Yeah, this is the first phase.  When you convince iTunes that we're not, you know, the devil.  Monsters.  Right.  Well, if you're the most downloaded, I think they're going to want to do more with you.  And you think it's like an animation of Kenny getting his ass spanked by my cock?  We could certainly call Coke Logic and get that done.  Do you really want to spank Kenny?  Because we've got the camera in here and everything.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:41:30]  It's a bit creepy, I know.  It really is.  It's really creepy.  Only because I'm afraid he'll, like, stand up and have a rod.  I'm submissive, you know.  This is good, finally.  Kenny's taking his big boy leather jacket off.  I've been dreaming of this.  Oh, bro.  Oh, boy.  Watch it.  Oh, boy.  No video.  Are you really going to allow Jimmy to spank you in your big boy underpants?  Oh, my God.  Elo, this is not right.  I'm logging on to Pop Rock as we speak. 
[02:42:00]  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Elo's.  Hold on.  Elo's logging on to Paltalk.  All right, hold on.  Let me.  Let me.  Let us know when you can see.  Let me cam this up a minute.  Let me get this right.  What you got is Kenny in his big boy underpants and his Chester King freaking shirt.  He looked like a white blob.  All right.  You're logged on there?  Fire away.  All right.  All right.  There he is.  Move the thing.  Oh, oh, oh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me go to camera six.  It's much better.  All right, camera six. 
[02:42:30]  Camera six is much, much better.  Hold on.  Okay.  Which one's out?  Oh.  I got.  This is the view you want.  Hold on.  Whoa.  Zoom in.  Zoom in around.  Yep.  Yep.  Let me get the whole.  Why is there no light?  Why is there no light?  Why is there no light?  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What the hell is going on?  What the hell is that?  Put some light on in here.  I don't know.  A couple of men with rods that need to be seen.  And why is Kenny getting spanked, Jimmy?  What's that?  Why is Kenny getting a big boy spanking?  That one.  Because Anthony's smoothie wasn't creamy. 
[02:43:00]  Wasn't creamy.  No.  Because the smoothie wasn't cold.  It was cum warm.  It was.  All right.  It was awful.  You ready?  Oh, my God.  Is that all you're giving him?  Because it's just creepy.  Jimmy is spanking.  Kenny.  As Kenny's bent over his big boy underpants.  Oh, my God.  You still smiling?  Hit him.  Jimmy, hit him. 
[02:43:30]  Hit him.  This is disgusting.  Oh, he did a rub.  He did a rub and smack.  He's got the alternate cheek technique.  Yeah, like you rub one.  Really give him a good, one good whack that'll leave a handprint on his ass.  But we have to acknowledge, why are your pants down, Jimmy?  Jimmy, faster, chow.  Here.  Um, I don't know.  Why wouldn't they be? 
[02:44:00]  I mean, it's only fair.  Kenny's looking hot.  Why wouldn't I?  All right.  Here we go.  Kenny's a big gentleman.  Smile, Kenny.  He's not even flinching this, Kenny.  He's used to it.  We're on the road together all the time.  He makes mistakes on purpose.  I forgot your pretzels and the pants come down automatically.  I love that Jimmy's pants come down. 
[02:44:30]  Why?  They should be down.  There's no reason for that.  Give the girl something to look at.  I guess we're done.  I mean, how am I supposed to spank him?  I'm not going to hurt him.  All right.  Send this off, Taito.  I'm not going to hurt him.  He's not going to come.  What's the use?  By the way, Elo, you're getting props on Instant Feedback for the Led Zeppelin channel?  I'm getting what?  Props for the Zeppelin channel.  Hold them up, Kenny.  What?  52, right?  59.  59.  I'm sorry.  59, the Zepp channel.  When does that go away?  About another four or five months.  Oh, wow. 
[02:45:00]  Okay, cool.  And then we've got another one we're going to announce after the first of the year.  You too?  You never know.  You never know.  That was a guess.  I hope it's you too.  Me too.  All right.  All right.  I think we're done with Elo.  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  I'll let you guys get back to the bondage and spanking.  So what do you want the listeners to do?  Go to iTunes today?  Just go to iTunes.  Sign up for all the podcasts, as many as you can.  How much per podcast? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, they're free.  Oos.  They're free?  They're free.  Wait a minute.  Oos.  So all you have to do is sign up and then what?  XM sends you the podcast automatically?  Yep.  When you open up iTunes, we push them out to all the pods.  It's free?  How does that work?  It's free.  It's part of our sampling strategy.  And then eventually you'll charge?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think we're going to keep these free.  If you look at the podcast, it's got a lot of branding in it.  Holy shit.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're giving away samples of the content.  And if you look on it, then you go to the XM site. 
[02:46:00]  And there's a place where you can get a free 14-day trial and buy a radio for the holidays.  You're using it to do some of that viral marketing?  Viral marketing, buddy.  Elo, how many subscribers does XM have now?  North of 8.5 million.  Wow.  Will we reach 9 by the end of the year?  Our street guidance was somewhere between 9 and 9, too.  Oh.  And the car deals are starting to kick in, I noticed.  Things are doing well.  We're feeling pretty good.  So we basically don't need Sirius, right?  We're doing great. 
[02:46:30]  You can't shoot this kid.  How many do they have?  Yeah.  How many do they have?  I need to look at their numbers.  I think they were north of 8.  I think they were north of 7 million.  I'm sorry.  Oh, you scared me.  No, they're north of 7 million.  7.  Okay.  I think that's where they were.  All right.  So we're north of 8?  8.5.  Oh, okay.  So we're about a million and a half ahead?  Yeah.  And finally, the cinnamon challenge.  Did you have to yell at anyone yesterday?  I had a little, yes, short answer.  Who'd you yell at?  Oh, wow. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I just, you know, anytime somebody is having respiratory failure, it's probably not a good answer.  Yes.  I was getting yelled at.  I got to tell you, man, Elo has been amazing for this radio show.  Other people in our career have just completely panicked.  They've had nervous breakdowns.  They quit the business.  All sorts of shit.  And Elo, man, he just fucking rolls with it.  He just rolls with the punches.  Absolutely.  But Elo, I got to tell you, we did show responsibility yesterday.  We saw this hot blonde on YouTube doing exactly what we did yesterday. 
[02:47:30]  And so we did our research.  We figured it was safe.  We figured, okay, if she can handle it, E-Rock can handle it.  And you can understand that, right?  Sure.  I understand it, but don't agree with it, but sure.  I mean, how many times, if you give a kid a gun, how many times is he really going to shoot himself with it?  Right.  So you could just throw them around to kids as play toys.  No, you shouldn't do that.  I think that's a careless, reckless abandon.  You shouldn't do that.  Yeah, that is a reckless of broadcasting also.  Have you seen the video?  Of E-Rock?  Yeah.  No, I'd rather not.  Oh, you should. 
[02:48:00]  It's well done.  It's actually much more handy if I'm ever deposed.  I can actually say I never saw it.  Never saw it.  Very good.  Just lie.  You got to see him today.  Plausible deniability.  He's going to have black eyes.  His capillaries in his upper cheeks are completely busted.  So it's kind of like he has a rash on his face near his eyes.  And his earlobes.  And his earlobes for whatever reason.  The whites of his eyes are coming back, though.  Those were bloodshot red yesterday.  That's just mayo.  They're filling up with mayonnaise.  They're filling up with mayo. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  He's full.  And, you know, he's a star on YouTube today.  I mean, it's getting viewed pretty good right now.  Hey, Hilo, let me ask you a question.  If somebody wants to listen to this show right now and they don't have XM,  is there a way for them to listen to it at XM.com or something?  Yeah, they can go to XM.com, sign up for an online subscription,  and listen to it online.  Why?  Who are you?  Why, Jimmy?  My friend wants to listen to the show.  Well, buy him a radio.  Yeah, I know, but I mean for now.  Oh.  Yeah, he can sign up right now, 14-day trial. 
[02:49:00]  Okay.  Actually, what's the website?  XMRadio.com.  Okay.  And you go slash the podcasts, and there's a button right there.  You know what I could do?  XMRadio, and I love the fact that XM has to pay for this.  Oh.  Look what I do now.  I want to show you guys something I could do.  Oh, boy.  He's got his phone up.  It's called the BlackBerry.  BlackBerry.  I got my BlackBerry.  To me, that's just a phone. 
[02:49:30]  The BlackBerrys will always be those big, clunky things.  No, I like the BlackBerrys.  Like the old ones.  It's the Pearl.  It's nice.  Although I hate to double click.  Look what I get to do.  On XM's dime, baby.  Now, how are you getting that?  You're subscribed?  Are you streaming that on the phone with you?  Yeah.  How much does that cost, XM?  Because I do it all the time in the cab now.  It's, well, we make money on it, so. 
[02:50:00]  Huh?  We make money on it.  Every time you listen to it, we make money on it.  So it's robbing Peter to pay Paul.  No, but basically the BlackBerry goes, are you sure you want to do this?  Because this is quite expensive.  It actually says that?  It's quite expensive.  Not in those terms, but basically they're like, all right.  No, it actually comes up with a question, are you Jewish?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Sorry.  I was like, oh, jeez.  You know, they killed him.  Elo?  Well, I will not hang up on you. 
[02:50:30]  I do want to ask you a question, though.  What do you like about the show lately?  I just love the free forms.  I mean, it just sounds like you guys are having more fun than you've had in quite some time,  to be honest with you.  The camaraderie.  Yeah.  There's like a very good camaraderie.  Yeah.  And guess who's maybe going to go to a therapist in the very near future?  No.  What?  I'm going to start some of that therapy.  Oh, we might be starting therapy.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Why?  What do you mean why?  You're kidding, right?  Because too many people have decided that I'm self-destructive.  I'm so glad.  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  I'm so glad.  Name that R, Silo.  Oh, couldn't tell you.  Let's call you over.  Come on.  That's cream.  You should know that one.  Yep.  Otherwise known as Aunt Smoothie.  All right. 
[02:51:30]  It wasn't creamy.  It was a problem.  Hold on.  If Elo doesn't think that I need therapy, then why am I going?  He knows.  He was saying why.  It was just kind of like he didn't know what he should say.  He wanted to know what you should offer up.  It just bought me some time to figure out how to change the subject.  Yeah, that was the worst, most insincere why I've ever heard in my life.  You know what?  Why?  You know what?  I'm not going to go to therapy now.  Good move, Eric.  Christmas music being played. 
[02:52:00]  See, I can even get the Christmas stations on my BlackBerry.  Yeah, see, I don't know if the BlackBerry's got XM lead or not.  It may.  I don't think it does, though.  Let's see what's on.  You want country or decades?  I go to country.  The hillbillies.  I fucking hate country.  Really?  I like the country challenge.  A little known fact about stupid Elo.  He used to be one of the biggest freaking country PDs in America.  Tell him, Elo.  Tell him.  Tell him. 
[02:52:30]  I was.  He speaks the truth.  He loves his country.  I do.  Oh, speaking of which, all right, this will get us out of this boredom that we've gotten  into.  Where's our Grammy moment with Kenny today?  Did you hear Kenny doing country today?  I did not hear that one.  I heard the one earlier today, though.  That was the one we did earlier today.  Yeah.  The Carrie Underwood.  No, the Carrie Underwood.  Heard that one.  And we don't have it.  Great.  Can we find it real fast or no?  Why would you have it?  Yeah, why?  Why would we? 
[02:53:00]  All right.  You know what?  I'm not doing therapy.  I just decided.  Thank you, Elo.  Oh, you should.  You're a true friend.  I appreciate it.  Huh?  I don't think you need it.  Yeah, I don't think so either.  Hold on a second.  You know what I need, though?  I'm going to start.  Do you understand?  Maybe he's not sure.  Do you think you're talking to Nathaniel?  Come on.  I will promise you this, though, Elo.  I'm going to start smoking pot soon.  That's fine.  That's good, right?  How about this?  Let's compromise, Elo.  Don't get carried away.  How about you give therapy a quick try for a year? 
[02:53:30]  No.  Just give it a quick try.  I go to therapy.  I had to cancel today because we got a thing, but I go every Wednesday.  Aw.  Actually, I was joking.  I don't really believe in therapy because I know they don't give a shit.  That's why they're good.  They don't care.  Well, they don't care.  That's why they're good.  They're paid to sit there and listen to you.  Now you're wrong.  That's why they're good, though, because they don't care.  They don't get emotional about it.  They don't give you honest advice.  Yeah, they're not like a friend that's going to say, give you advice they think you want 
[02:54:00]  to hear or something like that.  They have no ulterior motives.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to Elo.  All right, guys.  But keep listening to the show because we're doing this for you today.  It's a Grammy moment featuring our own club sort of caddy.  Elo?  Yes, sir.  We're cakes for nudges.  That's why I'm here.  But they're laughing at you.  Bleachers.  They love them.  We've got some nice people on the bleachers today.  We certainly do.  And Big A.  See, that was a joke.  Ding.  I love Big A. 
[02:54:30]  Elo, thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye, Eric.  Thank you.  All right, go subscribe to podcasts.  Merger by the end of the year.  I got to call my wife and check in on my daughter.  Good luck.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Bye.  A cold, thick smoothie.  Attaboy.  His wife's expecting another baby, right?  Yes.  Any day.  Did I tell you, Kenny, also on the walk over here, you know there's construction going  on?  Yeah.  Over there.  And it's right across from us.  Yes, it is.  And what do you think, Mr. Doom and Gloom, Kenny says, if that construction crane falls, 
[02:55:00]  it's going right into your building.  It's a big construction crane.  Yeah, but it's going to hit way up there.  It won't affect us.  You know what he would have said if he was working over at the construction site?  If that building falls, it's going to hit the crane.  He's constantly scanning his immediate area for just shit he can say is dangerous, deadly, 
[02:55:30]  potentially harmful.  I'll tell you this much.  If the crane falls and hits Kenny, the crane gets dented.  Yeah.  Yes, it does.  Ow.  What was that?  Was that a mosquito?  I have to protect you from all hazards.  Yeah, but there's no protecting from a falling crane.  No spanking is going to solve that one.  No.  And I think, you know, I think they're fine with the cranes.  Look, I certainly hope so.  Thank you.  All the statistics show they do come down. 
[02:56:00]  I really got to say something.  What?  I am thinking about smoking pot again.  Please don't fucking send pot in the mail.  Are you insane?  Absolutely.  No.  Now I don't open any packages.  Why?  Because I don't trust these fuckers.  So throw it out if they send it.  What?  Throw it out.  Or have you...  Eric...  Fuck me.  Oh, God.  I was just trying to think of E-Rock.  You need less sleep every night.  I got eight and a half hours yesterday. 
[02:56:30]  That's what I mean.  You need like two hours of sleep.  But no, funny story.  I wound up going to sleep at 3.30 in the afternoon.  And I want to take a little nap.  I'm like, I'll be up by six.  I wake up at one o'clock in the morning with my phone ringing.  And of course, a fucking text message.  Here's a lovely...  Who the fuck, first of all, is calling you at one?  A friend of mine who I haven't spoken to in a while who just didn't realize.  Who better have been...  I haven't spoken to in like four years.  Three years? 
[02:57:00]  Wait, hold on.  Let me tell you...  What's funnier?  Three and a half years.  A half always makes it.  I'll just keep throwing numbers out.  Seven years.  300 years is great because no one's ever lived that long.  Here's a really nice...  That is funny.  So I look at my iPhone and see my text messages.  I had a bunch.  One from Esty.  You know, I was supposed to do a spot.  I missed it.  Oops.  And here's one from my girlfriend.  I should be with you right now.  Now, that you haven't even called hurts me incredibly as you probably already know.  Don't bother contacting me at this point.  I am too upset with you. 
[02:57:30]  Holy shit!  Because she thought I flew back from California and then just blew her off all day.  You did, didn't you?  Because she called me...  No!  No.  Because she had called me earlier.  I just never called her back.  But I was sleeping.  Uh-huh.  So I called her and she's like, oh, I'm sorry.  And that was that.  What?  Hmm.  What?  Did you have...  I don't want to stir things up.  I'm just saying.  You can.  Did you have any time to give her a phone call and just say, hey, how you doing?  Yeah, but what happened was I wound up... 
[02:58:00]  I got home and then I wound up doing a phoner to Cleveland Radio to promote it on sale.  And I wound up...  I'm like, I gotta take a nap.  Take a little nap and I'll talk.  I think I was in a seer last night.  I thought I was in a seer.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  I said, I'm gonna see the bitch when I get up.  Why?  I gotta be calling.  I just wanna take a nap, bitch.  I'm tired.  Don't even contact me at this point. 
[02:58:30]  I'm too upset.  Yeah, I called her.  I said, bitch, why are you bugging?  I like ghetto Jimmy.  That's ghetto Jimmy.  What about Jimsy?  I like Jimsy.  Oh, Jimsy.  Jimsy is my favorite new character, Jimsy.  Jimsy.  Yes.  Sam, he fell asleep.  Somebody drugged his pasta, Sam.  He didn't even call his girlfriend.  And the hands opened.  Yes.  The perfect cleansing.  Can we go to break? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  I like that because right now my dick vein is filling with urine.  Oh, shit.  That's actually the name of my one-man show.  Can I tell you about...  A swim walk.  Can I tell you about...  Can I tell you about how good you shit after you eat this fine pink grapefruit?  Did it help you shit?  Oh, my.  Yeah.  Like a mudslide.  Oh, okay.  Like a mud...  See these little things?  They all come out individually.  Oh, I like that.  You know the little things that make up the little grapefruit?  It's lovely.  I wasn't going for a laugh there. 
[02:59:30]  No?  No.  You heard the comfortable silence, but I really wasn't going for a laugh there.  I made a hell of a fucking duke this morning, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, I dropped a nice one.  Dropped a solid shit in the toilet.  And I had nothing to wipe with.  I'm out of toilet paper.  I'm fucking wiping with Sabbath shirts.  Fucking horrendous.  All my girlfriend's clothes.  She has a pair of jeans right now with shit from the buttons down to the ankles.  I'll just blame it on her.  Who knows?  You probably fell in shit.  What do you think I did?  Wiping it?  What was the girlfriend line that got me today? 
[03:00:00]  You did those girlfriend lines.  Oh, the cinnamon shells.  Don't tell us.  Yeah.  Nobody tell her that it's dangerous.  Tell her that what happens is it makes you smarter and happier.  It makes you giggly.  A mouthful of cinnamon.  It's like sunshine.  Yeah.  Duck tape from our show.  Literally.  It burns like the sun.  That's fucked up.  Poor Iraq.  Oh, okay.  Or it's a little...  Yeah, we should have Big A record a Grammy moment for us.  We should have Big A eat some fucking cinnamon. 
[03:00:30]  He'd probably swallow it without a fucking...  I like how he has to sit in the middle of the bleachers because if he sat on one end,  everyone else would have to sit on the other.  Like a seesaw.  Yeah.  Tip over like Fred's car.  Hey, can we do a Grammy moment with Big A?  Mix it up a little bit?  You want to sing Plain White Tees today?  Delilah?  Hey there.  Hey, what do you think of the Brazilian girl there, Big A?  Cute?  What would you do to her if you had the chance? 
[03:01:00]  Let's just make believe she doesn't have a boyfriend and all that crap.  Paint her ass and dance wearing yellow flowers on my head.  What would you do to her, Big A?  Let's get into this a little bit. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know.  Look right at her.  I think you know very well.  Yeah, you know.  What would you do to her?  Look at her.  She's a nice girl.  She's cool.  She likes the show.  Dump her, right?  And don't do that date crap.  It's a fantasy.  What would you do?  Like, what would you do first?  She was willing and ready to go.  What would you do first?  What would be the thing?  No.  What would you do?  What would you do?  She's your slave to do whatever you want.  There's no embarrassment.  There's no repercussions. 
[03:02:00]  There's nothing but whatever you want.  Let's just say it.  What would you do?  There's no legal ramifications.  Right.  I would, uh, give her a strap, strap, strap, strap on, strangle.  I would put my cock in my mouth.  Oh, shit.  Oh, okay.  That's your first move.  No, you didn't.  Wow.  Geez.  You don't even fucking take her out or nothing first?  You suck.  Not even a kiss.  You're a douchebag.  Not even a kiss.  Not a fucking asshole.  Wow. 
[03:02:30]  What a chanting thought.  God damn.  Hi.  How you doing?  Shove his fucking dick in her mouth.  She thinks it's a big date.  He shows up with a Sarah Lee cake and fucks her face.  What's the matter with you?  She's a nice girl.  You got to go out first.  Jesus.  Wow.  Right to the cock in the mouth.  And he wouldn't even ask.  Right?  No.  Like, while she's on the phone with her mother, she'd be like, what?  And she'd turn it up there with me.  Whoa.  And knowing big A, she would still be able to talk to her mother.  Oh, come on.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Google bomb for your cinnamon movie on YouTube.  It'll drive up the views.  What's a Google bomb?  Is that a real term or did he come up with that?  That's him.  Huh?  I haven't heard of it.  I think Google bomb.  Well, you know how we all, like, get the search up?  Uh-huh.  Let's get the search up.  So we need, how do we get that as the number one search today?  The listeners make that happen like that. 
[03:03:30]  E-Rock cinnamon.  Trust me.  Yes.  Hmm.  E-Rock cinnamon.  I mean, that works on YouTube.  But you want him to click on it.  I have to pass.  Think.  Think.  Think.  Oh, shit.  I mean, that's good, but.  Thinking sucks.  I guess for queers.  Cinnamon.  It's cinnamon.  Mm-hmm.  You got to get their attention, like, uh.  Cinnamon.  Cinnamon.  Clip.  Cinnamon.  What?  Get their attention.  It has nothing to do with it.  How about, um. 
[03:04:00]  Don't start, uh, don't start Googling yet, because we got to get the, the, the right  term.  Mm-hmm.  Because not only do we want, number one, on Google trend, we also want people to go, what is  this, and, and click on it.  Hey, how is this?  Let's be honest.  No one knows who E-Rock is.  That's the only problem I have with that one.  How about this?  Cinnamon granules expelled forcefully.  People are right.  Cinnamon will just get spelt wrong anyway.  Yeah.  Not if we spell it for everybody.  Yeah, that's true.  Three M's. 
[03:04:30]  Does Pal Talk have a good, uh, idea?  No.  Because then we all go together and we start Googling.  Fucking ball vein hurts.  Cinnamon choke?  Uh.  Is that too boring?  Cinnamon choke?  What do you got, Dan?  You got a good one?  Oh, no.  Let's do this.  And I like the term Google bomb.  Yeah.  But we also want it to, cinnamon gag?  We want it to return the, the, the video as a result, right?  If you do it.  Yes.  Right.  So what do we got to do?  I see.  We got to get some Opie and Anthony kind of. 
[03:05:00]  Naive.  Well.  Cinnamon.  Come on.  How about, um.  Fatty chokes on cinnamon.  Yes.  Jesus.  That's right.  How about, yeah.  Come on, we're going to work together.  We're going to show you what technology could do.  I'm going to piss.  I know.  I know, Jimmy.  People are, I can think, I'll think about why I piss.  I'll come right back.  I'll have an answer for you.  That's an interesting.  What, what, what, what, which one?  Uh, Billy Baroo.  If you actually, because I think if we get some of the websites involved, you can just 
[03:05:30]  make sure they Google the actual URL.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That is a good idea.  Billy Baroo.  This is going to take a little, uh, you know, a little work on our part, but let's all Google  the exact, the, you know, the YouTube URL.  Or what about the description?  Well, no, because then people will click on it.  What is the YouTube URL?  Hold on, guys.  Bear with us.  Yes.  It'll be worth it in the end.  We need this up and running.  Yes, we do. 
[03:06:00]  This could be, uh, massive if we do this right.  It is one of the best fucking videos ever.  You're watching a man nearly die.  Yeah.  Of respiratory arrest.  So what?  That?  A man.  Yeah.  Sorry.  You're going to have to get the, the.  I don't know what he is.  The sites involved on this one.  Oh, nah.  Because then no one's going to click.  I think we've got to.  Well, people might see just a YouTube link.  How about, how about we just do best cinnamon? 
[03:06:30]  This will get, uh, pique everyone's interest.  Let's just go with best cinnamon challenge ever.  What would that do if it's Googled?  Will it bring you to the video, you think?  Let's find out.  Well, somebody then, you know, yeah.  That should do it.  Because that'll pique everyone's interest.  People are like, what does this mean?  There's a bunch of those.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Fuck!  Help us out!  Help us out! 
[03:07:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I, I, I, I, I'm fucking at a loss.  I'm looking for other people's ideas.  Ha ha ha!  Hmm.  E-Rock cinnamon is at the top of the page.  What does that mean?  You, you want to just do E-Rock cinnamon? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  I mean, we, that's what you came up with, right?  Yeah.  That, that seems.  All right.  Maybe, yeah.  All right.  Let's try that then.  E-Rock cinnamon.  Everyone, uh, Google that right now.  By the way, uh, Google's on to us.  They're changing their ways they do Google Trend to minimize, uh, Google bombs.  Are they?  That, uh.  Which is an old term.  Sorry.  Uh, the E-Rock cinnamon, the first, uh, link is to the LiveLeak version of this video, of  the E-Rock video.  So, at least, if you Google E-Rock cinnamon, you will get the video.  All right. 
[03:08:00]  Not our version, but the LiveLeak.  What is LiveLeak?  I think it's.  That's the old, uh, Ogresh.  Yeah.  Is it really?  Yes.  I used to love Ogresh.  Me too.  For the most part, except for the beheadings.  Oh, it's my favorite.  All right.  So, E-Rock cinnamon.  That's what we need to Google right now.  Let's get that as the number one trend.  Number one on the Google Trend, okay?  E-Rock cinnamon.  Cinnamon is C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N.  Just think Sin with N-M-A-N-E-F-R-E-T. 
[03:08:30]  Google E-Rock cinnamon.  We'll get that number one.  We'll get people checking out this video, okay?  Right.  We go to break with Club Sertikani and his Grammy moment for today.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Before he cheats, Carrie Underwood.  And then I dug my key into the side with his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive.  Carved my name into his leather seats. 
[03:09:00]  I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires.  Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:09:30]  The Yankees.  What's up to the listeners on the bleachers today, man?  Yo.  Got a nice little crowd out there.  I have a name for them.  What?  The Bleacher Creatures.  Wow, that's a good one.  I like that, yeah.  That was not my first choice.  We ought to copyright that or something.  Bleacher folks didn't sound as good. 
[03:10:00]  No.  If you're just tuning in, Google E-Rock Cinnamon for us.  Yeah.  Trying to make you move up the Google Trend thing to help the views of the fine video.  Hey, we're going to do Money Honey in the very near future.  What, next week?  Yes.  We need girls.  Girls.  Girls.  Preferably beautiful girls.  Couple of beautiful girls.  We need some girls.  Kikak Club.  Kikak Club.  We got $2,500 cash.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Actual cash that'll be thrown all over the studio. 
[03:10:30]  How'd that happen?  There's a little twist on our old game, Money Snatch.  Yeah.  We're doing it a little differently this time around.  And then maybe down the road we do Money Snatch again.  You never know.  Eh.  But we got $2,500 cash from BodogLife.net that'll be just thrown all over this brand  new studio.  We also have a five-night ski vacation from SkiColoradoNow.com.  Nice.  We're looking for five girls.  Yes.  Hopefully next week, next Thursday, next Friday, somewhere around there, right? 
[03:11:00]  Maybe Friday?  Friday, yeah.  All right, next Friday, to come down to XM, and what we're going to do is we're going  to kind of apply some honey all over your bottee, your nude bottee.  Nude.  As nude as you want to get, although we prefer nude nude.  Yeah.  Extra credit.  You know, where we can see your snatch and stuff.  Yeah.  That kind of nude.  Please.  Where your privates are showing.  Yeah.  You want to see some privates.  We want to see where your dirty putts are. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, why don't you come over here?  I'll show you how to make big boys like you.  Come here, like a little lollipop.  Lick the lolly.  Oh, God.  You know what I would do for my niece whenever she wouldn't feel good?  I'd make her a cump-sicle.  Oh, my God.  You can't even laugh at it.  It's just so uncomfortable and despicable.  It creeps me out, man. 
[03:12:00]  Take it out of the freezer.  It's like a popsicle, but you make it from your own body.  There you go.  Oh, God.  You don't worry.  So, can we get the girls today?  Uncle Paul's a creep.  Uncle Paul's a good boy.  No.  Give you $20 to shit in a pizza box.  Who's the fat kid with cinnamon breath?  I don't like him.  He ain't sexy.  All right.  Money, honey.  We need contestants.  We need five girls that need a little cash this holiday season. 
[03:12:30]  They'll get nude.  We apply honey all over your bodies, or you apply it yourself.  I don't give a shit.  Oh, next Thursday?  A week from tomorrow.  Nice.  And there will be at least $2,500 cash on the floor, thanks to BodogLife.net.  And then maybe we throw a few extra hundreds down there.  Who knows?  So, $2,550.  $2,550.  And at least one trip to Colorado.  Five-night ski vacation from SkiColoradoNow.com.  That's huge.  So, one of the dollar bills, maybe we'll have some kind of marking on it that will allow you to win the ski trip as well. 
[03:13:00]  You got to email Travis at dot, dot, dot.  Well.  What?  It's Foundry Music.  Oh, it's Foundry Music, but it's written Travis at dot, dot, dot.  I was in a hurry.  Oh, Travis at FoundryMusic.com if you want to be part of the money, honey thing we're doing a week from tomorrow.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Or we'll take your phone call now.  Yeah, I mean, you want to do this, we wouldn't turn your phone call down. 
[03:13:30]  Wow, look at the phones, though.  Woo!  Lighten up.  Whoa, get out of my way.  I got to get to all the girls that just call like crazy to be part of this.  Truckers and guys.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up with Roland and Paul O.?  Oh, there was, I heard, I heard there's something going on.  Yeah, what's this deal about?  I didn't, I didn't get to hear Ron and Fez last, uh, yesterday.  I was a little tired.  Paul O. called up.  Yeah.  Like he usually does.  He's going to talk about films.  Okay.  And then just started bad-mouthing Roland about, uh, how he's not a film reviewer. 
[03:14:00]  Okay.  Uh, he, he doesn't know about the films.  He wasn't able to convey what the, the storylines were.  Okay.  So I'd agree with him.  Uh, you're not a film reviewer.  Uh, but, but Ronnie was saying, well, he seems to see a lot of movies, which you do.  Would that be Ron and Fez noon to three?  Of course.  Okay.  He's going to kill you.  Ron and Fez featuring Lily.  Whoa. 
[03:14:30]  That's actually the, what they want to change the name of the show to.  Really?  Featuring Lily?  Featuring Lily.  That's nice.  With a dash after featuring.  She's a nice gal.  A gal.  Roland?  Yes.  Yes.  Do my, yes.  Yes.  Hello, Roland.  Hello, yes.  Doing all right.  Roland, so, Paulo is known for, uh, known a little bit about movies on the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  Apparently.  And I do believe he sees more movies than you do.  Not really, though.  He said he goes, he tries to see.  I don't think he does either.  Oh, really? 
[03:15:00]  No, I think Roland sees more movies.  I think Paulo is a liar.  I think he's like a compulsive liar.  Yeah, because he's not invited to junkets anymore, so that means he pissed off a lot of  people.  I don't think he was really going to that many anyway.  Yeah, he lies a lot to make himself appear to be better than he is.  Yeah, bigger and better than he is.  He's shit on a stick, Roland.  But unlike you, he gives Ron and Fez great radio, I got to tell you.  Oh.  Roland gives us great radio.  Not really.  Well, all right.  Every once in a while.  Right?  See, they're in agreement out there. 
[03:15:30]  They're just embarrassed for Roland.  I think you do great, Roland.  Well, he, and then, well, Paulo does things that, you know, you would never do.  Like what?  Put a jacket on?  Remember.  Remember that time when.  Do you remember?  He licked Sandy Kane's herpy growth or whatever the hell that was.  Licked their fucking genital wart.  Genital wart.  And then he, didn't he shit in a pool?  Into a pool.  Would you ever shit in a kiddie's pool?  No, I'll shit on Earl's desk right now. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, shit.  You would?  Yeah.  No, you won't.  Well, once I have to get shit, I'll do it to you.  Oh, well.  Well, he'll sit down.  No action.  I said in 24 hours away, we'll go shit on his desk right now.  Yeah, Roland.  Everyone pooed earlier this morning.  Wow, you're crazy.  Ooh.  If he had to shit, he would shit on Earl's desk, everyone.  Ooh.  Watch out for Roland.  He's unstoppable.  Come on, Roland.  Go over there and shit on Earl's desk.  Go ahead.  You're the most productive thing on that desk in a long time.  Pop out a nugget right now. 
[03:16:30]  I'll try.  How about this?  All right, get a microphone.  Let's see if he can at least try.  Pull down your pants.  I don't have to go now.  Put an asshole print on his phone.  Mark, how about rub his phone on your ball-banging asshole?  And rumor has it that Paulo wants to fight Roland.  I heard that he wants to fight me in February.  What?  February.  For what?  I don't know.  When this shitty movie comes out, apparently, he made.  Oh, his movie?  Is that the one that, like...  They're not still acknowledging that he's in.  No filter Paul is in? 
[03:17:00]  They're not acknowledging this movie still, are they?  What's it called?  Attack of the Shrunken Heads?  What's it called?  What's his movie called?  I think it's called Gap.  Oh, Gap.  His movie's called Gap.  What's it?  No, Roland was extremely pissed yesterday when he started hearing this stuff on Rotten Fez.  He texted me after I told him what was happening and said,  Paulo can suck my cock and Dave, the WGA member, crossed the line.  What an asshole.  Because he's part of the member and he wrote a song about me. 
[03:17:30]  So technically, he broke the WGA rules.  What was the song about?  What's the dope?  What is this gang talk?  What?  He's talking about the Writers Guild.  The Writers Guild.  Because he said he's part of the WGA.  Oh, really?  Well, here's some audio from yesterday.  This is Paulo hating on Roland.  Hey, Paul.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, Paulo.  How are you doing?  Yeah, this Roland guy is...  I mean, I know movie critics are basically assholes to begin with.  But, I mean, he's got to be the absolute bottom of the barrel. 
[03:18:00]  Well, I don't know if Roland's really a movie critic.  He's a guy who enjoys film.  I mean, you know, okay.  People have called me a lot of things over the years.  But I'm a big, strapping guy.  I can beat the crap out of any movie reviewer in the country.  And this guy is, you know, he's a Truman Capote wannabe.  I mean, he can barely talk.  But who else is...  What other movie critic looks like they could fight?  Roger Ebert don't even have a voice box anymore.  Well, you know, I don't understand why Roland has to go and steal Paulo's bit. 
[03:18:30]  Paulo always does his end-of-the-year top ten.  Roland does...  Every critic does an end-of-the-year top ten.  But Paulo does it on 202.  Right.  And it has been for years.  He's been doing it on the Ron Fess program.  But not on ONA's program.  It's all a totally different show.  There you go.  Roland, what do you have to say about that?  Let's see what you got.  Paulo is calling you out.  Well, I'm not a movie reviewer.  That's what I never claimed to be.  Yeah, see?  That's just it.  He never claimed to be a movie reviewer.  And Paulo is a fucking, like, wannabe stunt guy for the radio show. 
[03:19:00]  He used to do all kinds of stunts.  He got tattoos all over himself for losing stupid bets.  He's just an ass.  What else was he going to do with that body, though?  Oh, what a disaster.  Let's be honest.  He's got this overinflated self-worth.  Yeah.  He thinks he's making a movie.  Yeah.  What is this movie Gap about?  I just heard little bits and pieces that it was filmed in, like, three hours.  Well, No Filter Paul is in it. 
[03:19:30]  No Filter Paul is in it.  So it's about what's between his ears.  A gap.  Get it?  It's like my father would say, use your head for something besides a hat rack.  Oh, that's telling you.  All right.  Let's move on.  Now, Roland, uh, Paulo's getting pretty, uh, down and dirty here.  He's calling you gay in this next clip.  Roland is the movie critic slash stuntman who, I hate to say it, Paulo, has replaced you.  First of all, he's not a stuntman.  He's like the Marshmallow Stay Puft guy. 
[03:20:00]  He's like, good one.  He's awesome.  Marshmallows.  You know, when they were talking to him the other day, they asked him outright, are you gay?  I mean, because if you have a gay voice and then you're going to pretend not to be gay, I mean, there's nothing wrong with being a gay and having a gay voice.  But you're going to go in there with that gay voice and then say, oh, no, I love, I don't like cock.  I mean, he literally said, I don't know.  He's stupid.  That's it?  That's the end of the clip?  Hmm.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Paulo's a man's man.  Always has been.  He's nothing but butch. 
[03:20:30]  And Roland just is, he's tubby.  He's got a bad hairline.  Why are you guys fucking beating up on him?  Because.  You're trying to be ONA juniors?  No.  He gets enough trouble on his own show.  We don't like him taking over Paulo's turf.  He's not a stuntman.  I could smack the shit out of him first.  I don't even think you could beat him in a fight.  That's it?  Okay.  Fight?  You want to fight Paulo?  You want to fight him?  Well, what do you have to say for yourself?  You want to have to fight.  I don't know who Paulo is.  First of all, Paulo sounds gayer than Roland. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  He always has.  Yeah.  I mean, we know he was married at one point.  Yeah.  That went horribly wrong, as was documented on the Ron and Fez program.  Some of the best radio ever, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Roland, would you like to, you know, maybe, I don't know, do some mud wrestling with Paulo?  So you want to sexy it up, is what you're saying.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I'm not mud wrestling.  I figured I'd do both these guys a favor.  No.  Maybe jello wrestling? 
[03:21:30]  Hot oil wrestling?  Something with a food product.  Oh, you don't like the whole getting food on you?  All right, so how about mud?  You like getting food in you.  Well.  How about cinnamon wrestling?  You guys roll around in a big vat of powdered cinnamon?  Here's someone that doesn't know much about me.  Oh, my mom.  I hear Poe.  Jesus.  In the background.  That's my freaking phone ring, but I want the Drew Boogie new thing.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Tell me I need to put that on here.  You specifically said you wanted it. 
[03:22:00]  I sure did.  I want the thing.  All right.  So, where we at?  We have to fight on February when his movie's in the film festival, whichever film festival.  His movie's not going to be.  What film festival?  That's what he claims.  He's always claiming this stuff.  God, is he a disaster.  What film festival?  There isn't a film festival in February.  He's screaming at me.  So, are you going to fight Paulo or what?  Oh, this girl's got duty on her.  What's on this broad fucking chest?  Did you see this? 
[03:22:30]  Look at these broads.  Look, it looks like someone made duty on her.  She's on Maury.  It's extreme teen plastic surgery.  And this African-American woman has these big growths on her that look like duty all over her.  What a fucking moly broad.  She has duty on her.  What is that shit?  Wow, that is like.  That's a tank top.  That is awful.  How about a fucking cowboy jersey?  Just fucking slice it off.  And he told me not to worry.  He was going to fix everything. 
[03:23:00]  During the second procedure, I felt the doctor removing the staples from me.  He didn't give me no pain medicine, nothing.  I knew that my once-timed scars would be worse than I ever imagined.  Oh, no.  So that this man wasn't even a plastic surgeon at all.  I can no longer look in the mirror.  What the hell was she having done?  All I see is the massive scars that were in my life.  Tattoos?  I'm guessing removed.  Oh, I'm looking.  Could you wear something that really shows him off?  Yeah, no kidding.  You're a beautiful girl with duty on you. 
[03:23:30]  Get her a winter coat or something.  It looks like a fake bottle you bought in spices.  Yeah.  He just said you're beautiful, too.  You're beautiful.  He did?  That son of a bitch.  I know you don't think so.  They don't look right.  Wait a second.  Lots of things don't look right.  We all make mistakes.  We all make mistakes.  Okay?  I bet you wish it never went.  Yes, I do. 
[03:24:00]  How were the scars before?  They were really small.  I wanted to look like everybody else I did.  And you wanted to be a model.  Yeah.  And you thought that that was holding you back.  So you go to this doctor.  And by the way, it's not a doctor.  This was an MD.  You thought he was a plastic surgeon.  That's what I told you.  What did you find out afterwards?  That one of the head nurses there that told me that he wasn't a plastic surgeon.  What was I doing?  These scars are raised.  It looked like duty was thrown out.  And it was supposed to be laser surgery, right? 
[03:24:30]  Was it laser surgery?  No, it wasn't.  He cut you.  He used a scalpel.  Then when you went back afterwards to find him, where was he?  He wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  He was gone.  Yes.  Vanished.  He was gone.  You haven't found him yet, have you?  No, I haven't found him.  Well, we found him.  And I've been to like seven, ten lawyers.  I mean, it's a lot of lawyers.  And nobody wants to take my case because I signed a consentful.  See, that's the thing.  You better know what you're doing. 
[03:25:00]  By the way, Maury doesn't have a doctor to fix that.  When you sign that consentful.  No, no, everyone's waiting.  We have a certified plastic surgeon, Dr. Mengele.  His budget for this show sucks.  And expose your personal story.  Uh-oh, you might have a doctor.  To an entire country.  Is that or the fact that you're coming out to sing a song.  And the good that you can do, because what would you tell everybody out there?  To do their homework?  We're going to supply you with chocolate pudding to rub all over your body so no one notices the duty on you. 
[03:25:30]  If you need any help, you talk to me.  I'm just going to tell everybody that she's an aerial view of a map.  Wait, wait, wait.  We want to try to help you as much as we can, all right?  And we want to be a support system for you.  You are a beautiful woman.  And you have a right to lead a happy life, okay?  Oh, my God.  What's he going to do, though?  He said a support system.  No.  He goes...  Oh, don't let me...  I ain't touching it.  We're going to give all your friends masks.  A million dollars.  No, what he said is, we have a great staff that will support you, but they don't have a doctor. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, they didn't give...  Because Moore doesn't have a budget to find a doctor and take care of this girl.  All he said is, we'll do whatever we can to support you.  Right.  They have nothing for this poor girl.  You'll get nothing and like it.  We found a guy who said he'll fuck you without throwing up.  How lovely.  All right, listen.  Jesus.  So, Roland, this bit is taking off.  You and Paul O., it's just amazing.  I know.  So, he's calling you gay. 
[03:26:30]  What do you have to say about that?  Yeah.  I'm not gay.  Oh, of course not.  You don't like cock, right?  I don't.  I don't.  You think it's okay?  What?  Cock.  Cock is okay.  What do you like about cock?  Yeah.  What are the things you like about cock?  If you had to pick one.  Out of the long list.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What the fuck is with this show?  The shaft or the balls? 
[03:27:00]  Neither.  Like, when you, this is not even to be gay.  Yeah.  But, do you like to grip or to glide the hand up and down?  Hmm.  I don't know.  I guess glide.  I glide?  That's cool.  Watch the mouth.  Good boy.  What kind of an asshole do you like?  A glide one?  I don't know.  What are you?  What's wrong with you?  Why are you answering this?  All right. 
[03:27:30]  Paulo challenges Roland in this next clip.  This bit is just, wow.  The shelf life on this one is going to be unbelievable.  It's off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  Yes.  Hit it.  You know, I mean, I'll take a punch any day of the week.  That's right.  I'm sure I will do that.  So, what do you want to do?  Get in the ring with Roland?  I'll get in the ring with 20 Rolands.  I can't get 19 other Rolands.  I hope not.  You can get a clothing machine.  I'll be up there in New York in February around Oscar time.  I'm going to try and get my movie screen and all of that.  You set it up for a review for Roland to watch it? 
[03:28:00]  Absolutely.  All right.  So, this is the challenge.  You want him to climb in the ring?  I'm not trying.  We got enough room in this studio to set up a ring.  We do an Afro show, and we let these guys go at it.  Well, I'm just saying.  I'll be up there in February.  Anybody who's got a fucking problem with me, I'll fucking take care of them.  All right, big guy.  All right.  Easy.  He's gotten really angry.  Yeah.  The one thing I love is, like, I'll be there February around Oscar time. 
[03:28:30]  And my film is going to be, you know, review or submit.  What did he say?  Something.  Like, he was trying to imply that his film, in some way, shape, or form, is connected to  the Oscars.  Like, it would even be considered for anything.  What did he film it on?  Why are you acknowledging that this film exists?  Because they talked about it.  They got to stop.  I would love to see it, because it's got to be god-awful. 
[03:29:00]  I gave up on that storyline on Rana Fez well over a year ago.  What?  The Gap?  Gap story?  There's no film.  Let's be honest.  There is a film.  No.  Stop it.  Paul was in it.  Stop.  No filter Paul.  No.  I'd love to see him acting.  Didn't he have a starring role?  Yeah, I would like to see him acting, too.  What did he play?  Like a human.  Detective.  That's right.  He's on a child pornography case.  Then he realizes it's all in a briefcase in his own house.  It's called the I Did It. 
[03:29:30]  Roland?  You're our guy.  What's going on, man?  Paul is getting the best of you here.  He wants to fight you.  He's calling you gay.  You don't need to know this guy to give it back to him a little bit.  Give him the business, Roland.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Do Muhammad Ali on his ass.  Let's go.  What do you got?  Talk up your shit.  I don't know.  Let's just.  Easy.  Come on. 
[03:30:00]  Well.  What's up?  I don't know who he is.  I don't know.  He's an asshole, I guess.  All right.  That's good.  Both barrels.  Yeah.  Wow.  You don't hold anything back, do you?  Jesus.  No, no.  You're shitless.  Holy shit.  Just.  Ron and Fez.  Another bad bit they do.  I don't know.  Oh.  Wow.  You're getting on Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Dave's an idiot, as we all know. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, I don't know.  He's a fan of his.  How could you call him an idiot during such a happy time in his life?  He's going to be a father.  Well, I hope his baby's a water baby.  Just announced yesterday that he's going to be a daddy.  Is he really?  Yes.  I hope the kid's retarded.  There you go.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, no, you didn't.  You know.  You know.  I hope the word, I lost my baby, comes in a month.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  That's for the song.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  That.  Oh, my.  That is nothing. 
[03:31:00]  Nothing.  That's why I hold my anger back.  Nothing but uncalled for.  Hey, he wrote a song about me, Dave.  Holy shit.  Yeah, but how bad was it?  What did the song say?  La, la, la.  He's got a big forehead.  That doesn't, you know, equate to wishing ill upon anybody's unborn children.  Of course.  18 years of explaining photographs.  What a fucking new potential.  Wow.  How are you?  That's Roland.  He's got a.  Wow.  All right.  Well, we got the Roland.  Holy mother of Christ. 
[03:31:30]  I don't even know what to say after that.  Roland.  Jesus, Roland.  Didn't you realize you were just having fun?  There's radio and then there's, like, real life.  Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with you?  Find the line.  So what else, Roland?  I'm not going to bail on you.  Yeah.  Jimmy's with you still.  Yeah.  What else do you wish on Eastside Dave?  Jesus.  It's not about his kid, but about him.  Let's just deal with him.  He's the total zero here.  Go to the whole family fucking mafia.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  I know.  Why don't you give him a Colombian necktie?  I don't know. 
[03:32:00]  Just.  Just.  Because every time I start getting angry, I'll say something that I just said.  Well, let's listen to the song and see if anything pops out of your brain.  This is Eastside Dave doing the Roland song.  The Roland song.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Yeah!  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  He eats corn from his colon.  And that is why he has a ride.  He has chip-up cheeks that look swollen. 
[03:32:30]  And less charisma than Kyle Bolin.  Oh, that pudgy Roland has ride.  He eats Doritos all day Sunday.  With worse hairline than Jeff and Gundy.  He weighs more than King Kong Bundy.  His ass is wide.  Roland eats feet stew.  Roland sips.  Roland chews.  Roland farts.  Roland blues.  Ride.  Roland's bigger than a barge.  Man's breast.  Muddy lodge.  In the Fed Army.  He's the sarge.  He has a ride.  Rawhide.  Yeah!  Roland, Roland, Roland. 
[03:33:00]  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Yeah!  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Roland has a rawhide.  He's got a good voice.  I, uh...  I don't know why you got so upset about that.  Yeah, that's...  It wasn't that bad.  Still.  Still by my baby comments.  Jesus.  He stands by his baby.  Have you stand by those?  You didn't appreciate this song about you.  No.  He'd go fuck himself.  Jesus.  Wow, I've never seen him so...  Would you like to retaliate with a song of your own? 
[03:33:30]  No.  Like, you're a bad producer.  You don't know anything.  No, no, no.  I don't know about Steve, bro.  Steve, Dave.  Alright, so...  You didn't appreciate Dave taking a dig at you?  No.  Because, I mean, they damned it.  Like, hey, or call me saying,  hey, we're going to talk about you.  It was just...  Sam texted me.  He goes, turn your XM radio.  Then they started trashing me.  The guy, he's going...  And then Fez going...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't feel well.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  The stupid Earl going,  hello, hello, yeah.  There's no movies.  Go fuck yourselves.  Wow.  Yeah, hey, if you want to see guests,  turn on our channel  instead of begging for me.  We're on the same channel.  We're on the same channel,  but basically you're bragging  that you get good guests  for our radio show?  Not bragging.  Just one guest, Earl wanted that.  Which one?  John C. Rally.  They're claiming stuff, so...  Oh, what's the problem?  I don't know. 
[03:34:30]  What's the issue there?  There seems to be a problem  because I know that he's going to be doing  Ronnie's thing.  Yeah, but he's going to do our show too.  But he's doing our show.  Yeah.  But is that a problem?  I don't think so.  I don't think they were too happy about it.  Who was?  I don't know.  I guess Earl wasn't,  but then he goes it was okay.  Oh, that we were going to...  But isn't it two different things?  Ronnie does like his own thing.  But we got him first, though.  But it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  We're all on the same team.  Like, who cares? 
[03:35:00]  Do you...  Wow.  What do you have to say about Black Girl?  Who's that?  Oh, her?  No, no.  Earl.  Earl, not a black girl.  Oh, no.  Just that he just jumped on top of it  and started trashing me, too.  Yeah.  These movies...  So what do you have to say to Earl?  Oh, nothing, though.  Um...  I don't have, like,  any ill will towards Earl.  No?  No.  You wanted to shit on his desk.  Yeah, well,  because just making those comments,  but...  Do you have to shit?  No.  That is not an act of friendship.  What about, uh,  Ron Bennington? 
[03:35:30]  I like him.  I mean, he didn't trash me.  No?  No.  Just Fez.  Fez trashed you?  What did Fez say?  What did Fez say?  He said I sound gay.  Well, look at the source.  I know.  That's what I said.  You know?  It's the pot calling the kettle a cocksucker.  I just get annoyed.  That's all.  Do you have a small penis?  No.  What is the... 
[03:36:00]  Where does that come from?  How big of cock you hide down there?  Yeah, let's get into the size.  Just sporting something.  Let's get into the size of your cock.  I think it's regular size.  What do you got growing up down there?  I don't know.  Are you all balls?  I bet you it's six thin with hair growing up to the...  Like, almost halfway up the trunk.  You shave down?  What do you got?  A little pattern down there?  I mean, he's...  Or are you a hairy mess?  I am a hairy mess.  Down there?  No.  I mean, geez, look at me.  But do you shave, you know, keep it well kept?  A mangroomy? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  I try to, but...  What?  Do you shave?  No, it's shaved my ass, but...  Oh, oh, your arms and stuff.  It's like a weed lacquer?  If I know, it's like Steve, too.  It was really...  All right.  Yeah.  Well, this was just wonderful radio.  Good for Roland.  Roland's fucking not happy.  Well, we saw a side of Roland that I've never seen before.  That's right.  I did.  You know Casey's going to kick your ass now.  You do realize you're going to get your ass kicked, so...  Oh, Dave's wife?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to be Dave that gives you the beating.  It's going to be Casey. 
[03:37:00]  And all of her friends, because she's got a lot of good friends and stuff.  Yeah, you're done.  You went over the line with that statement.  Yeah.  Yes.  They're going to pull the rest of your hair out.  That's fine.  And shove it down his throat.  That's fine.  Do you have any...  And then they're going to make you, like, lick a vagina.  That should have got something.  The whole rumor that he might...  No?  Fuck.  It's just too uncomfortable.  Do you have any...  Would you like to amend any of your statements? 
[03:37:30]  I apologize to Casey for making the baby comment.  Do you apologize to Dave, too?  No.  No.  Wow.  How do you apologize to one and not the other?  Yeah.  It's a mutual creation kind of a thing, you know?  It takes two.  Well, I hope the baby's like her, then Dave.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's been said 80,000 times.  I don't think Ronnie even said that.  All right.  All right.  Gee.  Oh, boy.  This is not going to bode well. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  I can't wait to listen at noon.  Yeah?  This is an out-of-control radio war.  Radio war.  It's like rap wars, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's going to be some gunfire.  Buck, buck.  Drive-by insulting.  This is just amazing.  This is like watching the Jets and the Dolphins play.  It's going to be crazy.  I don't know when we all started bombing.  I know.  But, boy, are we. 
[03:38:30]  Well, because, like, Roland has no energy, and he brings down everyone else's energy.  I don't know.  I like Roland's little vibe.  Go shit on Earl's desk.  Help us out.  I wish I could.  Just try to push out a nugget.  Nobody will notice.  I'll just think Earl fell asleep on her.  Wow.  I don't have anything in for that.  All right.  Thank you, Roland.  There you are.  All right.  All right.  There's Roland.  Thank you, Roland.  Defending himself today.  It's amazing.  There he goes.  He had to.  All right.  E-Rock, you good?  Yep.

Where is it at?  Madison Avenue.  I don't know.  I'm going to give me the address.  It's 550 Madison.  550 Madison Avenue.  If you're in Manhattan right now, you want to watch John C. Reilly's brand new flick.  I can't remember the name.  I don't know why.  Walk hard.  We're watching that today at 12 o'clock.  And we'll let some listeners in today if you're in the area.  You all right, Jimmy? 
[03:43:00]  I have a bit of a cough.  Oh, no, thank you.  YouTube, check out E-Rock's Cinnamon Challenge thing.  Also, iTunes, XM's got, what?  Podcasts.  Podcasts.  Podcast.  Podcast.  Let's go have some lunch.  All right, let's do that.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What's the Yopi and Anthony experience? 
[03:43:30]  Those were...  Tedious.  Those are...  Ah, yes.  He's pure.  Nice tag.  Very good.  Very nice.  Very good.  Mike...  Who's that guy in a suit outside?  Who are you, sir? 
[03:44:00]  Probably an intern.  A suit?  You're an intern?  These dummies come in suits.  Intern candidates come in suits because they're told at college that they've got to be professional  and show up in suits.  Who are you interviewing for?  I'm just curious.  Just, I guess, for the show.  Just a general internship.  Yeah.  CSB.  CSB.  Ah, the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Correct.  That's good.  And they recommend that you show up in a suit and tie.  Proper attire.  Look professional. 
[03:44:30]  Have a resume in a nice folder.  Leather bound.  Leather bound.  And what did they say?  Greet the interviewer with a strong handshake and a blowjob.  That's right.  A firm handshake.  Oh, a firm handshake.  Oh, shit.  What's his name?  Ken.  Ken.  And Jimmy wants to know if you'll get, like, naked down to your underpants.  Naked?  Uh, no.  Before we, uh...  No.  Why?  That's still, like...  Say goodbye to everybody today.  No.  Why would you even say that? 
[03:45:00]  Because Jimmy wanted me to ask.  I'm trying to find out.  He's coming in for an internship.  I'm sorry, Jimmy, but I can't do that.  He could end up being, like, probably one of the best interns ever.  Well, enjoy your ten minutes at XM Satellite Radio.  Maybe not.  All right.  You have a good memory.  I'm fine.  Sorry.  Who do you got to interview with?  Travis.  That couldn't be more wrong.  No.  Good start, Junior.  Look at Van.  I never got a name, then. 
[03:45:30]  Who?  Me, Steve, and Danny.  Oh, cool.  The triumvirate.  Basically, what Dan's trying to say is that Travis doesn't rate.  Travis has a wonderful set of skills.  That's a shame.  But just they aren't making decisions like the rest of the men.  Exactly.  Okay.  Fair enough.  I guess that's it.  Time for lunch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good boy, Tinkle.  Let's get till tomorrow when it'll be Thursday.  Thursday. 
[03:46:00]  Good tease.  Yeah.  That's right.  Coming up tomorrow.  Thursday.  Thursday.  Okay.  How do we do this?  I don't know.  Point?  I don't know.  It's always so awkward to leave.  Oh, no.  It's not.  This should be just an easy out, but every day it's the same thing.  Yeah.  Should we do the same?  You know, we start the show the same every day.  We do?  Yeah.  With the, you know, ecstasy of gold.  We should end it the same way every day.  That way people know that we're gone. 
[03:46:30]  So you want me to pick my nose?  Wait, hold on.  We have to end it the same way every day.  Yeah.  Fuck.  How about, like, you ever see that Michael J. Fox movie where he's being the, he's trying  to make Kirk Douglas happy and he's pretending that he's like Jimmy Durante?  No.  You remember that?  No, but I'm embarrassed at even the thought.  No, but he was doing the, ah, cha, cha.  Cha, cha, cha, cha.  Cha, cha, cha. 
[03:47:00]  You want to end it with, ah, cha, cha.  Yeah.  Jimmy Durante was a cunt.  He probably just buried his nose in chick's snatches.  Ah, cha, cha, cha.  They love it.  They love when I, ah, cha, cha, cha, their clit.  Can you turn around before you do your impression?  Sure.  You got to turn around and then say, it might look something like this.  Uh, cha, cha, cha, cha.  Oh.  I heard this, how about this? 
[03:47:30]  Turn around again.  Get ready for your impression.  All right.  He's getting, he's turning back around.  Ah, cha, cha, cha, Sam.  Ah, cha, cha, cha.  It's Quincy.  Ah, cha, cha, cha, cha.  That didn't work.  No, it didn't, it didn't at all.  It didn't stop the show.  No.  Somehow we got to end the show.  The show must be stopped.  It's an entity unto itself that must be halted for the day. 
[03:48:00]  Put back in its cage until tomorrow morning when we will release it again.  Release the kraken.  Ooh, I got pissed.  No, no, Jimmy.  I do, I got pissed.  Jimmy.  I'm hurting the dick vein.  Oh, okay.  I get that fucking pain, man.  I got to go.  How about, uh, abracadabra?  Hold on.  Um, Hocus Pocus?  Let's see what, um, Ethel's playing today.  All right.  What happened?  Everyone's just taking a piss. 
[03:48:30]  Everyone's just leaving.  All right.  But, uh.  Hmm.  I don't like that song.  What is that?  I don't know.  Awful.  I don't like it.  Let me see what else I can find.  Yeah.  I'm not a big Lucy.  Well, I guess I am a Lucy fan to a point.  Let's see what Lucy's got on right now.  I like how the show just, it doesn't end.  It just slowly falls apart.  Well, yeah.  That's nice.  It's not a show that has that da-da-da-da-bump ending.  It just kind of slowly, like, comes apart and just is left there laying in pieces. 
[03:49:00]  Literally pieces.  Jimmy is in the bathroom, sitting here.  Who top tracks?  I listen to that.  It's pretty good occasionally, but.  A little repetition.  Holy shit, I'm yawning.  I'm going to guess they're playing The Who right now.  What's your guess?  They're playing that.  What are they playing on top tracks right now?  What's your guess?  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  Top tracks.  They are playing CCR. 
[03:49:30]  CCR, let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  It's Dr. Paddy's song.  Yeah.  One pill makes you huge, the other makes you see you.  Oh, boy.  Eastside Dave's here.  Oh, Dave.  Oh, boy.  Now this happened.  What?  Jesus, I thought the show was going to end.  Hold on.  Let me turn off my XM.  Oh, God.  How do you do this?  Okay.  A retarded baby.  Uh-oh.  Wait, wait.  Why would his mic work?  Hold on, Eastside.  This is, uh...  Yes.  Go ahead. 
[03:50:00]  A retarded baby.  That?  A retarded baby.  Why don't you say it to his face?  Why don't you come...  Where's Master Pug?  Where's Master Pug?  Get rolling in this fucking studio right now.  First of all, I have retardation in my family.  I know that's not much of a surprise.  But nonetheless, you don't fucking wish that on a guy who has a baby.  Nobody.  At the end of the show, I said I apologize.  Well...  You better apologize, you son of a bitch.  You better apologize before I put these fucking 24-inch pythons around your neck.  I'll tell you one thing right now. 
[03:50:30]  Where's Master Pug?  He's not here today, and this is a hell of a day for him to not be here.  I'm not exactly sure if I...  He's a big, stocky boy.  You're scared of fighting him?  No.  Look.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got him in a headlock.  He's not doing much to me.  Well, I don't know.  Oh, his head just went into the wall.  Oh, they're brawling.  Fight on!  They're brawling.  Fight on!  Where are they?  I got his ass, though.  I didn't even find him.  I got his ass!  They're moving too much.  Fight! 
[03:51:00]  He's holding Roland's ass.  All right, you spanky Roland.  That's...  That's...  Roland is...  All right, all right.  All right, all right.  They're beating the crap out of each other.  I got some of this!  I'll get you any time you want!  I know.  It's trying to get your clothes off.  Where is he?  Why am I looking at more?  Hey, little bitch.  Oh, there he is.  What?  He said he held back, Eastside.  Roland's very strong.  No, I didn't want to fucking come in shooting my mouth off about Roland.  Especially on the Open and Empty program, two of the four greatest hosts in the history 
[03:51:30]  of radio.  But!  What about...  What about...  Jimmy's...  Jimmy's bigger than the host.  Jimmy's, you know, he's a super...  Wait a breath, little bitch.  What's that?  Wait a breath.  Oh, you're a son of a bitch.  The whole point, Mr. Opie...  Hey, darling.  The whole point of this song was that fucking Roland comes in.  He's trying to take Paul's thunder.  I hope I have a son.  I don't want a son, you fat bastard.  Look at this fat fucking Jeff Van Gundy.  I am, but I'm not on the brash, you dumb motherfuckers.  Go produce a show.  I'm a fat Jeff Van Gundy. 
[03:52:00]  Go produce a show.  I get fucked with the ass by a Marty Stoudemire every night.  Let's talk about movies.  That hasn't been done before.  I'm going to write a fucking song.  This is the first time I met people.  This is the first time you've spoken clearly in the fucking hair.  Go fuck yourself.  This is the first time you've spoken with any goddamn volume in three years.  Go fuck your mom.  This is the first time you've talked about starring in seven years.  This is the first time you've talked about coffee breath in nine years.  Go see 100.  This is the first time you've spoken with a fucking show.  I'm going to do Netflix. 
[03:52:30]  This is the first time you've talked about without being a fucking asshole in 15 years.  This is the first time you've talked about anything in 35 years.  That's really big guest stars.  This is the first time you've talked about anything but fucking in 45 years, you son of a bitch.  And you're still under breath.  And I'm the fat one.  I'm out of breath because I got passion, baby.  A passion?  Unlike you, I ain't seen it on this program. 
[03:53:00]  I ain't seen it on any other program.  Oh, wow.  I went to Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  You come in here.  A four-year degree.  You're trying to eat your top ten.  That's a ball-off gimmick, smart guy.  My college degree costs more than yours.  What are you going to do next, Lequando?  Oh, did you go to college?  Don't you rip off ball-off in my life.  Oh, I went to L.A.  Oh, Jesus.  They're backfiring.  All right, they're backfiring.  All right, Roland.  Eastside Dave's got Roland in the head.  All right, Roland is losing his fucking mind.  Roland.  Roland's ass crack is hanging out. 
[03:53:30]  Look at Roland's ass crack.  Oh, Dave's on the floor.  Roland just threw him.  He pushed this down again.  Oh, God, no.  It's the real fight now.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh, it's insane.  Roland's crazy.  I'm learning that Roland is crazy.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Roland's on him.  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  I got to say Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Roland's kicking Dave's ass.  I think you saw this coming.  Get a mic on him.  Get a mic on him. 
[03:54:00]  Get a mic on him.  Where am I?  It's way too powerful.  Oh, my God.  A coffee breath.  That's the most lethal move I've ever seen in wrestling.  Holy shit.  Oh, and he's out of breath again.  It smells like coffee and semen and fucking farts.  Wow, you're out of breath.  What the fat guy's not?  You got dragon feces breath on me, man.  Yeah, from your wife.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  Hey, Dave. 
[03:54:30]  Roland has no to three.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he's getting it.  Oh, you're getting it.  Oh, he got the plug.  While you're screaming about me.  Paolo.  Paolo's going to kick your ass, baby.  Oh, no.  Paolo's going to kick your ass.  You're out of breath.  You're out of breath, Dave.  Paolo's going to kick your ass.  You're out of breath.  I'm not out of breath, help me.  I'll train for a month.  This is passion.  This is why this fight's never about me.  You're just picking on, you know, fucking Bobby the Brain Heenan.  The real man's my man, Paolo. 
[03:55:00]  He's going to take you down at the hard rock.  I challenge him.  I'll leave it at that.  You got to leave it at that because he kicked your ass.  Let's be honest, Dave.  He did kind of kick your ass.  You barely got a shot.  Steve pulled me off.  He's a fatso.  This guy doesn't even have a hint of a muscle and he just kicked your ass.  What about Slapbox right now?  Slapbox?  Slapbox.  He's fucking, he's a fatso.  He's going to put his weight on me.  I'm going to fall to the ground.  Me, I'm in shape.  Look at this.  I'm 195 pounds of twisted Irish steel.  But you're out of breath.  Because your fat fucking stomach was on me. 
[03:55:30]  People are commenting that Roland has leaf bark skin.  I pray it's a Slapbox match.  I'll do it tomorrow if you want.  Slapbox?  No.  I said Slapbox.  Let's go.  Hey, Slapbox, I'm done.  Oh, of course.  Because you know the speed.  Look at the moves.  All right.  All right.  Dave's moving around.  He's showing off his moves.  Look at the moves.  He's showing off his moves.  Look at that.  Yeah, that's a good move.  Look at the speed.  All right.  I can do a jumping jack.  Can you do that?  When's the last time you've seen your dick, Pudgy?  Huh?  That's what I'm about.  That's what I'm about.  I'm about seeing my penis, baby, when I piss. 
[03:56:00]  That's what I'm about.  I'm about not having hair plugs like Jeff Van Gundy either.  Wow.  Oh, that was a hair plug joke.  Wow.  Yeah.  Eastside, are you a little scared of rolling?  Slapbox!  Slapbox rolling?  Come on, let's do what men do.  I gotta go to a...  I'm in the fucking Ricky hat in your ass.  I know he lost.  That was a bad reference.  I'm gonna go early.  My head's not thinking clear. 
[03:56:30]  Where do you live?  Queens?  Is that what you can afford?  Yeah, come to Queens.  Yeah, all right.  Come to Queens.  Wow, he just made fun of where you live.  I live in Brooklyn, you add.  Touch fucking fatso.  I've lived in Brooklyn for four months.  Right?  Oh, no, I can't afford that.  I'm sorry.  Maybe in one day, I live in a place that's two blocks away from Mr. Buscemi.  Two blocks away from Mr. Turturro.  Two blocks away from Mr. Turturro.  Two blocks away from Mr. Turturro.  I live three blocks away from Mr. Giamatti.  I live two and a half blocks away from Mr. Ledger. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, whatever.  If you goddamn give Mr. Ledger some goddamn respect.  Are you making fun of his marriage?  You give Mr. Giamatti some respect.  You give fucking Mr. Turturro some goddamn respect.  My friend's his manager, you dumb fuck.  Oh, yeah.  I never met them.  Oh, my friend's our manager.  Who are your friends?  He's a manager.  Manager what?  I've never heard of that.  I've never seen him.  My friend's a manager of Dairy Queens.  And what castle?  The fuck are you talking about?  The fuck yourself.  Oh, my friend's your friend.  Holy. 
[03:57:30]  I grew up in L.A.  What's your contact?  I know a guy from Subway.  I know a guy from Parker Meridian.  I know a guy at the Big Spamburgers.  I know a guy at the Masters Square Garden that sells peanuts.  I know a guy at the New York Yankees.  I know a guy in a parking lot, Section 4.  I know a guy at Dan Dwayne Reed.  I know a guy at Walgreens.  I know a guy in a parking lot.  You want to talk to me about Mr. Turturro? 
[03:58:00]  I know a guy at the Big Spamburgers.  I know many people.  You want to talk to me about Mr. DeVito anytime, baby.  He's a personal friend.  You want to talk to me about Mr. Bam Bam Bigelow and Mr. Craig Vigio of the fucking Houston Astros.  Come talk to me.  I'll be excited to tune in and listen to them on your show.  And check next door to my mom.  Well, I'm sure you can get them for the bucket list on your show.  I'll be glad to tune in.  I will.  With that Sopranos tattoo on your back.  My Sopranos tattoo is for my love of the Sopranos. 
[03:58:30]  Other people might think it was a lost bet.  I don't look at it like that.  I look at the glass half full all the time.  That's what I got that you don't got.  Passion, glory, and drive.  Paula's going to kick your ass.  Success and money.  I'd rather take those two.  You can take your three.  Look at the passion.  Look at the passion, Pitsy.  Pitsy, you see the passion.  Yeah, Pitsy, yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  Wow.  I do believe.  This is a sad day for you, Dave. 
[03:59:00]  I took him down in that, Mr. Opie.  Roland kicked your ass physically.  I took him down.  And emotionally and verbally.  Roland has been a sleeper since we've known him.  Yeah.  I've never seen him come.  I thought in a verbal and physical fight, Roland would get his ass handed to him.  He fucking owned.  Oh, no.  This is a dark day.  He's strong.  He's strong.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Woot.  Roland's a fiery Mexican.  That's right.  Keep writing him notes, too.  The Mexican came out in him right there. 
[03:59:30]  He's a Mexican.  In his pants.  It's a fried bean.  Roland doesn't have writers.  Go ahead.  Say another line that E-Roc just wrote you out posted.  I did.  Let me tell you something else, too.  It just shows you.  Why don't you call Pissy to write your line?  I bring other people's talent level up.  Like Bill Parcells before me.  I fucking come into town and I build up a program.  Why can't you build a barrel?  You were a puddle of shit before me.  Like the Cowboys, like the Patriots before Parcells came into town.  After me, you win championships.  I congratulate you. 
[04:00:00]  But don't know, don't ever forget who fucking just birthed you right here.  You came out of my vagina, baby.  Am I retarded?  Am I retarded, too?  Oh, no.  Maybe we'll have two retarded babies in your family.  Oh, man.  Roland's an animal.  Roland, don't pull punches.  Adeline.  What the fuck, dude?  He doesn't fight fair.  Roland, don't pull punches.  Jesus Christ.  It's called working with Carson.  You have to defend yourself.  Johnny?  Daly?  Yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, no.  The other one.  Oh, my God.  I mean, I don't want to say yuck.  I don't want.  Something doesn't tell me that you really got to kind of stick it to Carson Daly, do you?  No, he's like a brother to me, no.  Yeah, okay.  You talked very clearly during that whole thing.  No, he was yelling and really angry.  Wow.  I've never seen it where Eastside Dave couldn't get a word in edgewise.  That's a sad Dave for Eastside Dave.  Sad Dave for Apollo.  And Ron Efez, 12 to 3.  For Ron Efez.  When you threw the plug in before he was able to get it in, that is like taboo. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  For one of their guys to come in, the first words they utter on mic should be Ron Efez,  12 noon.  But he slipped that one up, and then you destroyed him physically.  He thought he could charge at you against the wall, and then verbally you just handed  him a new ass.  Wow. 
[04:01:30]  Now we have our ending.  It's over.  So long.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of Wow Stickers and 2x4s.  Solid as a rock. 
[04:02:00]  Oh crap.  I'm not insured.  Opie and Anthony!  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers at opieandanthony.com. </pre>
