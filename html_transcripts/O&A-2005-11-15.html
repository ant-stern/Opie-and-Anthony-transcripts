<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about Earl, a caller who had persistently pitched a "Black Rock Coalition" radio show idea to Eric Logan, the head of XM Satellite Radio.  After recounting Logan's initially dismissive response ("Why would I buy this? It's a piece of crap show."),  a debate ensued about the show's merits and the definition of "rock music," ultimately culminating in Earl being granted a two-hour Saturday night time slot.

Simultaneously, Opie detailed a graphic account of his apartment's rat and mouse infestation and his unsuccessful attempts to eradicate them using various traps, providing vivid descriptions of the gruesome results.

Eric Logan appeared in studio for a segment resembling "Ask the Boss," answering listener questions about XM programming, channel availability (specifically the lack of a streaming trucker's channel), the upcoming launch of XM Canada, and other operational issues. His responses were often laced with humorous evasiveness.

A significant portion focused on Opie and Anthony's XM-funded shopping spree for an upcoming photoshoot. They recounted their extravagant experience, including limo service and high-end stores,  while Logan reacted with amusement and exasperation at their clothing choices and the challenges of wardrobe selection.  The expense report and lack of clear spending guidelines led to a debate about reimbursement.  The hosts also discussed the upcoming studio renovation, including plans for new cubicles, a stripper pole, and a band area, referencing a newspaper article outlining their vision.  They also discussed making the studio less welcoming to certain individuals.

Multiple callers contributed to the broadcast.  Nelson inquired about a studio webcam; Scott in Virginia asked about XM channels' appearance on Direct TV; and Mike from Baltimore suggested an unorthodox disposal method for an unwanted muffin.

Bill Burr was a guest in the studio for a substantial portion of the show.  Discussions ranged from Opie's photoshoot attire and a sexually suggestive anecdote about Burr's chef to a planned "fat chick eating contest."  A particularly disturbing segment involved a discussion of pro-anorexia websites and their graphic content, including descriptions of self-harm and disordered eating.  The conversation involved several callers, including Heather, Michelle, and Stephanie, who expressed interest in the eating contest, with one caller's sister also recruited.

Another caller, Stephanie, recounted cheating on her husband, resulting in him having a heart attack, but surprisingly, their relationship improved, culminating in her receiving a G-spot orgasm from him. This led to further sexually explicit jokes and discussions of infidelity and weight issues.  Musical interludes by Stephen Lynch were included.  Bill Burr also called in again, promoting his stand-up show.  The hosts discussed a new show intro by Steve, compared to Laszlo's work; video games including Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Nintendogs, and Star Wars Galaxies; and a humorous, sexually suggestive shaving commercial.  The segment concluded with discussions of a potential business meeting and an XM commercial featuring the hosts and Snoop Dogg.  Laszlo was a studio guest throughout parts of this segment, and E-Rock was mentioned.


The show also included a discussion of a new national commercial campaign for the show, contrasting it with previous advertising efforts.  Laszlo was again a studio guest, his numerous electronic devices prompting jokes about potential health hazards.  A "speed round" of news topics followed, including Miss Senior America's rap performance (described as "comedy terrorism"), a nasal sex spray, and other news items provided by Laszlo.  More banter, a promotional segment for the show's "best of" moments, and promotion of Bill Burr's stand-up shows (while carefully avoiding conflicts with other comedians) filled out the broadcast.  The Nintendo DS game "Nintendogs" was discussed,  along with a listener’s plan to use it for nefarious purposes.  The case of an 18-year-old who murdered his girlfriend's parents was analyzed, focusing on the motivations and critiquing a television news expert’s perceived downplaying of the event.  The nasal sex spray and Miss Senior America’s rap performance were revisited, followed by Laszlo mentioning a Netflix-style porn service, an anime sex doll, and used panties vending machines in Japan, resulting in more sexually explicit and racially charged jokes.  The broadcast concluded with mentions of a planned photoshoot.

[00:07:30]  machine you're yeah no i brought coffee wait i gotta back up and explain though the last time  i saw the lovely aaron uh they were at in my uh apartment yep and she was nine and a half months  pregnant and you had no furniture for her to sit on she was so pregnant wasn't it funny that's right  and she had nowhere to sit yeah wasn't it at the same time the black earl was pitching me that horrible  show the black rock coalition oh didn't you tell him that it wasn't horrible though i did but that's 
[00:08:00]  what i tell people like oh is it how to good oh it sounds great you know send me a demo please  earl will still have hope earl will still have hope even if we played this very clip for him that  elo himself is saying a piece of crap show that he promoted just for the new listeners uh black  girl has been pitching this black rock coalition for probably 10 years it's a program where he that  he would host that uh just features black rock artists and do you know the demo he i actually 
[00:08:30]  you know because opie said would you just please humor him pleaded with me and i said okay fine so  i actually i didn't want to take his calls anymore right i can i'm and frankly i'm getting tired of  taking his calls so i actually listened to it it was an hour demo with nothing but music and he said  like two words and i'm like that's earl i'm like what am i actually if i actually bought this  what am i buying what the hell am i buying besides a jukebox besides somebody's very limited jukebox  you want to get the worst records i've ever heard in my life but yeah that was the last time you saw 
[00:09:00]  because once you with the joke is once you get past living color you're pretty much done with the  whole playlist i forgot i made the mistake because uh they used to live in the neighborhood before uh  elo got the huge job down there in washington yeah so they were in the hood and they came over to  watch some football and i forgot that i invited earl that's right earl got his ear about the damn black rock  colell he was this guy's making multi-million dollar deals all over the place and he has to  sit there and listen to earl's pitch between earl's pitch and then listening to ben just talk about  the patriots and you know ah yeah i pass non-stop opi's apartment with no furniture in it yeah 
[00:09:30]  exactly you can even sit down i got lovely i got stuff now oh really yeah i got stuff you're still  a minimalist huh you're still a minimalist i don't like a lot of clutter did you get a couch  no i got the same well the real question is is the rat problem solved oh that's gone right  i got uh i got traps set all over the apartment and i haven't gotten anything in a while i'm kind  of bummed bummed yeah that means the problems have been solved yeah but it gets it it gets  addicting you're addicted to mouse hunting thing after a while yeah mouse or rat it was it was mice 
[00:10:00]  i was gonna say it wasn't one mouse it was uh my total i think i caught nine haven't caught one in  about two months now did you do the hammer thing where you actually put him like in the bag and get the  hammer and cove well that's what they should explain when you get the glue traps the glue  traps i started with the glue traps what would you get a glue you know that was probably invented in  like 1810 and and the glue trap remained unchanged i started with the glue traps they got modern 
[00:10:30]  technology i'm assuming maybe there's a little chemical on the glue traps that uh you know puts  the the little mouse to sleep nicely you gotta finish him off oh my god instead you wake up in the  morning and he can't move he's stuck from his ear to his ass and technology based on the tar pit  and he's whining yeah he sees you coming he's having like a little mouse heart attack yeah yeah mice make  uh some sad noises yeah you don't you don't think they do until they're in pain it was awful  it was awful and then you got the uh we we put the word out actually and we're sent some pretty 
[00:11:00]  sophisticated mouse traps yeah the electronic one was the best they're amazing just electrocutes  them they're amazing cooks them i actually walks through a little maze it's a black box with a hole  in it and he walks through a little maze and then there's two metal plates at the end with the  lovely piece of peanut butter or cheese or something just out of reach just out just where he's got to  step on those two metal plates and just that's the beauty of the trap you don't have to ever reload  the trap no they never make it to the never make it to the peanut butter they never makes it when 
[00:11:30]  have you seen a mouse in like con ed boots right unless he's in there ain't gonna make it it's like  the green mile for mice or something yeah and the trap went off the trap went off when i was in the  living room so i quickly jumped up and went to the kitchen he was already dead so it's like it's so even  if you wanted to save the mouse it was kind of where you are now he's he was done gone done  immediately and better than the uh the uh traditional spring-loaded whap mouse trap because those could get  sloppy yeah yeah those things are like the guillotine yeah and it's a horror thing because 
[00:12:00]  they never just look like a mouse with his neck stuck in it it was got some contorted the ring  face on and i like yeah the eye is out of his head his ear is off half of his head is severed  you guys are amateurs amateurs good don't consider me an amateur those traps don't work that well  they're too smart for those traps i set those things so many times i i think i broke a finger  because they were going off in my hands and stuff because i couldn't set them right  don't you think the words out about that whole gimmick the mouse trap the words out on that one 
[00:12:30]  amongst the other mice they can pick at the cheese and actually yeah pick the cheese off of those  traps that's what they were doing over and over again it's like you come in new york and someone  goes you want to buy a vcr you know there's like a brick in the box yeah everyone everyone's on to  that everybody you see the new uh mouse trap it's uh that spinny one how does that work  the spinny one yeah i think decon makes it you take it it's round you turn it a couple of times  and then you put it down and the mouse goes in and the thing goes whap and spins back i don't know 
[00:13:00]  what's happening inside of it i don't know if it just closes the door or some kind of pulverizing  action is happening inside but you just take a blender yeah i was thinking that way where it would  pulverize them well you know for every mousetrap there's somebody who they actually test these  somewhere so there's some like lab somewhere where they have these ideas and are cooking up these  mousetraps different ways to kill mice yeah and somebody has to approve these mousetraps somewhere  yeah like that's a good one i want to see the ones that aren't approved they could yeah the ones that 
[00:13:30]  don't quite make it don't quite make and then what is the criteria there's too much suffering in that  one yeah it's got to be the suffering angle right that's why i'm surprised they still sell the glue  traps because that just seems like you know suffering because the ones that they're putting out now  end it really quickly yeah it's like that thing that johnny it's so fast and that's the way they  kind of promo it on tv is how quick it is and then you just pick it up and throw it away hey we got  black girl on the on the line wow earl on the line yeah earl yeah uh the word's out the word on the 
[00:14:00]  street is uh elo does not like the black rock coalition and it will not be part of the xm lineup  anytime soon didn't sound like earl when he said yeah is that earl earl yeah i'm sorry he literally  just walked me out is earl it is earl yeah earl earl we heard your your meeting uh back when at opi's  apartment about elo and you would you would talk about the black rock coalition and then you came 
[00:14:30]  i remember talking to you about it and you were very excited that you had spoken to elo about it  and uh i guess he had told you well you know sounds all right or something or get me a demo or  yeah i think i gave him a written proposal and and it was written it was handwritten handwritten no it  was not handwritten it wasn't typed up it was typed up you know what in fairness it was typed up but it  had that that plastic sleeve that you put your reports in like the eighth grade you know with the 
[00:15:00]  little plastic thing to slide down the side and actually it was like a tent it was like a like  an orange kind of shimmer tent really yeah it was well done and then uh yeah but we just heard from  elo that um i what was the exact quote he used opi just moments ago why would i buy this and he called  it that piece of crap show that earl pitched hey earl i want to help you make a better demo when you  make a demo you need to actually talk on the demo earl much like right now earl yeah this is the sound 
[00:15:30]  of disappointment yeah yeah yeah the sound of disappointment absolutely he's he had this thing  going in his head it was a hope a dream and you know how long it takes i mean you you make a show  you make a pitch and to get somebody to sit down and listen for 60 minutes from tip to tail the whole  thing yeah and i'm listening to it and i'm looking around going i i don't get it i do not get it and 
[00:16:00]  not just anybody this is elo we're talking about here and this isn't some low level guy uh you got  right to the guy that you need to get to earl and uh he's saying you know i don't get it earl  he doesn't get it well i'll have to refine the idea i'm refine you've been working you've been  working on this for how many years we've known you how many years have you worked on the black rock  coalition idea six years maybe i don't know six years and you're not willing to give up on it huh  earl has a dream huh no why not everybody has an idea that they want to get across you guys have a 
[00:16:30]  dream and you guys worked that and got it done yeah but there's actually you know you might be  surprised but there's actually a little bit of substance to this program the key is we had an idea  and you actually talked you got to start with an actual idea not a fake idea and it's not just  playing you know black artists doing rock music you have to kind of have an angle to it where you  would talk and and do something apparently you didn't talk on this well well you also got to 
[00:17:00]  remember i well it's about the music yeah yeah but you know what thanks for bailing him out bill  it's about jesus christ it is not about the music we've got a library at xm with like four and a half  million songs having somebody tell me you can play more music doesn't help me i disguise that too  well i was just joking you gave him an out he was struggling and you gave him a rope bill this  show's about black rock artists name five yeah jane hendrix all right good uh that guy from fine young 
[00:17:30]  cannibals would that be on your show earl would that help earl well fine and cannibals yeah sure why  not why not that's two bill and then be serious try to come up with three more it's tough uh and he  wants a whole show a full-time show but to his credit living color of course that's that's that's the  benchmark right there how about i wait till number three you're already to three you just need two 
[00:18:00]  more that guy uh uh what is his name um will it go round in circles was it billy preston  earl billy preston yes billy only member of both the beatles and the rolling stones  he was a fake member yeah so does lenny kravitz qualify lenny when billy preston played on his own  he played black music though of course yes yeah so it wasn't rock rock music is like white music 
[00:18:30]  that is the most asinine statement i've ever heard it really isn't because you know what you  know how white people when they try to play funk it stinks because it's just not inherently a part of  them that like living color they stunk they were great musicians but i mean the only time they were  good was when they started to make it a little more on the funk side you know what i mean  wow earl you're just brilliant today no whatever i mean you guys take over everything like with  sports and all that shit so if you guys are actually really good at rock wouldn't you have 
[00:19:00]  done it by now no what wouldn't there be a band out there with just like yeah guns and roses all right  but they stole from us here's the real deal i mean bill do you see now the issue we have with the show  we have the author the architect and the vision of the show on the phone right and you can't defend it  and here it is afro you only came up with four by the way well i'm getting overrun by four guys  you won't let me get a word in get a word in we've sat here listening to silence every time we  we go to you earl name your top five get a word in well god top five right off the top of my head 
[00:19:30]  uh-oh how about a top two what seven dust seven dust uh you know letting kravitz uh i gave him that  one yeah sly and the family stone sly and the family stone chuck berry is sly and the family stone rock  though i know that i i don't know i don't consider that you can dance to it it's not rock i'm sorry  well your definition of rock i'm sorry that's my music sir stand down stand down stand down 
[00:20:00]  that is my music too that's exactly the point of the show i wouldn't consider a sly and the family stone  uh rock and what about fishbowl in there that's like funkadelic it is yeah fishbowl look i dare anybody  to listen to the first four funkadelic records and say they don't rock as hard as any album that  it was that first i think from funkadelic but i don't consider that rock we actually work for 
[00:20:30]  a little bit of a deli you don't think that kind of gives it away if it was rockadelic you'd have a  point why don't you just do a funk show you get it on the air yeah should we give them one black  funk coalition one shot on this fine channel on a saturday night i say absolutely black people say  when they listen to rock the beats fucked up yeah yeah earl if we gave you four except for earl how many  hours will we go well initially we only i'd only ask i think for two hours i'm not i'm not being 
[00:21:00]  that i mean i'm not that ambitious to think i could all right earl if we give you two hours  two hours on a saturday two hours on a saturday black rock coalition hosted by earl and then you  know what we'll let we'll let the pests decide if the show there you go right we'll have a little  poll on uh... opianthony.com what do you say up for the challenge earl right on i'm always up for  challenge all right yeah i like that attitude we want you to dj this thing that's the new earl  no no you give me this no all i ask for is a shot and that's what i want that's what you're at 
[00:21:30]  yet what you're offering me that's what i'm doing are you gonna dj this sure why not yeah all right  our old dj the black rock coalition are you gonna are you gonna only are you gonna talk more than you  did on your demo oh of course no i mean are you gonna book maybe a guest oh have an interview  yeah i could trade i would like that because it would be a well-rounded uh balanced show right  you play some music you talk about the music you have an interview with one of the artists something 
[00:22:00]  like that i actually saw a little independent film about uh black uh punk rockers black punk rockers  yes wow that is really niche was that afro punk uh probably was it for earl knows it because the  earl does know a lot about this stuff i can't remember but i was watching it and then like  the the lead singer would be like you know i'm singing punk and he looks out it's all a bunch  of white kids listening to it and he goes and i just want to be this isn't for you i'm not talking  to you and he went and all that type of shit oh oh yeah and then by the end of it they were 
[00:22:30]  saying black people invented punk rock and uh by that point i wanted to throw my movie chair at the screen  last night on ifc they had a film called uh you know a straight up punk documentary  yeah and the guy who directed it was don let's he used to work with the clash  extensively he's a brother from england all right well earl when do you want to do this this saturday  you pick the date i'll be there let's do it before the christmas holiday we get a lot of subscribers  yeah look at elo he's thinking elo hate your idea you are really gonna have to do something uh pretty 
[00:23:00]  special i assure mr logan that you will have a much broader picture of the show what i put together was  so awful it was what earl it was like a sketch it was like a very small sketch of the idea why would  you make a tiny little sketch for the big guy it's supposed to come with the big guns in the demo 
[00:23:30]  anthony and i used our power for you to get to the big guy and you hand him a sketch  you should have sent him like a uh a rembrandt right you destroyed that credibility i don't think  charles schultz made a stick figure of like the peanuts no to get the job right probably like charlie  brown it's gonna be much better than this but you get the idea by looking at this stick figure of  charlie brown now you got another problem to contend with is our midwest listeners who are 
[00:24:00]  starting to uh chime in the only black rock coalition i want to hear involves a chain gang and a quarry  you know there's the racism now that you're gonna have to overcome because it is national you are  talking to the entire country earl there's a lot of square states out there that and the country will  hear it and the country will enjoy it and the country will decide right i think you're giving  him too much credit for being open-minded seven dust is a white band with a black singer it doesn't 
[00:24:30]  count hmm interesting i'm actually looking forward to this now yeah you know what that's kind of like  that's kind of like the white drummer in uh sly and the family stone yeah and he was just you  you know i mean the reason why that shit was so crazy was because of uh that that crazy black dude  right came up with the funky shit yeah all right earl listen we've wasted enough time on this yeah uh  uh somebody's pointing out you call him to tell him his show idea sucked now you give him a show 
[00:25:00]  why because well uh well i just think it's really more closure the show is more about closure  it's more about closure it's you know you can't keep holding at least earl will be able to sleep  at night knowing he had his shot that's hysterical now it's just earl this is closure for you that  should be the name of the show closure welcome back to closure you know what guys i i've been left for 
[00:25:30]  dead before and you know what i've always rebounded that's true let's give us an example give us an  example thank you that was really like a hacky how are you letting him off the hook with that  because they they finally uh did they fire him from any w or did he quit he could get that job  tomorrow come on that was that was a big that was a big statement no no i'm not talking about  professionally either oh personally give us an example earl uh his ulcer i dropped my toothbrush this  morning well my my ulcer guys i nearly died nearly died that is that is true i nearly died 
[00:26:00]  damn it we weren't ready for a statement like that earl yeah thank you  yeah yeah all right earl you guys name the date i'm there saturday this saturday let's go this  saturday we got don wicklin in what time he'll set it up what time what at night way at night  i'm voting for like two or three in the morning i say way at night apparently we're uh 
[00:26:30]  well i guess the question would be would be for to earl it's like when would be the optimum timer  well yeah you got a shot when would you want to do it 10 p.m when we set the clocks forward and you  lose an hour i say midnight saturday night you you that means uh nine o'clock l.a time where all the  movers and shakers are i'm gonna listen what do you think uh again it's up to you guys you guys are 
[00:27:00]  calling the shots on this one trust me if we announce you're doing the black rock coalition  this saturday night at midnight you will have an audience i'm not doubting that at all i have  complete faith in you by the way earl uh hawk have a have a worst up ready  and someone somebody from our show has to you know be here so you guys can record all the hate  calls in another room and you will be live on direct uh tv channel 879 that's right by the way 
[00:27:30]  uh we're getting some listeners right now chiming in this that launched today launched today on  direct tv you could listen to this very program all right earl we're gonna let you be all right  guys thank again thank you for the opportunity how's the fezzy doing you speak to him um no i  mean you know i just want the rest he's you know he's with family now so yeah yeah very good all  right earl early uh earl thumbs up or thumbs down on billy ocean no no billy ocean didn't he do 
[00:28:00]  caribbean queen i'm just telling you the show is going to be how about phil bailey with that phil  collins it's going to be yeah well the show is going to be diverse it's going to be unique who's  that guy i always feel like somebody's watching me that is rockwood what about him you know it's funny  i find it i mean i'm putting on my militant hat for half a second uh-oh i find it ironic that 
[00:28:30]  you know i'm generalizing here but i always find it ironic that you know first white people are the  first people to knock black music but the first to steal it also are we stealing his music oh that's  yeah not when it comes to rock that's great as you're trying to get people on your side in alabama  good luck saturday night at midnight buddy what about herbie hancock good luck i met him the other night  you met herbie hancock yeah it's great how's he doing he's doing great  all right listen earl he's a legend of course he is earl we're gonna let you go all right all right 
[00:29:00]  i'll see you in a bit all right can't wait it's always a pleasure black earl at what point did we  say white people didn't steal black music we were just saying i know all the sudden music is our  horrible version of your music and thank god we did we made it better a lot better yeah all right  we got to play brother i was black earl song oh yeah great song this is a great song it's called black  earl lazy bum one of joe's best songs i think ever for the new listeners earl uh

[00:32:30]  and shop with sunglasses like me it's like hey you guys want to buy some fireworks i'm like yeah  yeah and i bought this what looked like a bazooka i mean it's like it's like six feet long metal tube  all right and i forgot about it i set it up on there and then gibbie haynes from the boat  old surfers was traveling with us for a while too so gibbie got into our m80 supply that we usually throw  each other so gibbie's like hey man let's let these on the bus i'm like oh that is so lame man we do that 
[00:33:00]  every day what's wrong with you here oh i remember i got this six foot pyro on here  so we're in the back of the bus we light the things and this thing the guy told me i remember the  toothless guy told me he's supposed to make like a pirate ship in the air or something  it's like it's supposed to make this galley in the multi-colored  so we like the thing in the bus while we're rolling down the highway between houston and dallas 
[00:33:30]  so we we light it i'm laughing i'm thinking all right we're gonna put it out okay i'll light it  and just freak everyone out a little bit greg like just gets down on one knee at the very back of the  bus and aims it for the front of the bus that's all you do booyah the thing goes off pellets bounce  up the door and catch every bunk on fire all right and the great thing about this was is every fire was  a different color this is so psychedelic well we're done spinning yarns today kids and it's a good thing 
[00:34:00]  too because i gotta go dig a hole and poop in it come back soon for another tall tale from your old  uncle al al jorgensen  ah exactly we're back with the opian anthony program we just got a nice surprise visit from  the big boss thank you eric logan where you going oh man people want to ask you questions 
[00:34:30]  oh is this like the ask the boss segment of the show of course you know you know some of those  news stations i've asked the mayor and the mayor comes in and you could go hey i got a pothole in  front of my house uh when's it going to get fixed and the mayor goes well we're sending the road crews  out give me the address i'll make sure it gets uh taken care of this is almost like that and you  know the mayor sits there like ah fuck i gotta go fill in a pothole that was one of the most fascinating  bits of radio i don't think bloomberg does it because uh it was a cbs thing and bloomberg's got 
[00:35:00]  his own radio station i used to watch i uh watch i used to listen to that show every week or whatever  it was the greatest show you ever hear this show bill once a month what show julianni would go on  the radio and it was called ask the mayor and it was on cbs their news station or something and he  would sit in and for an hour take phone calls from people in the city that i swear they were this uh  uh mayor giuliani yes uh wonderful uh talk to you yeah um uh there's been this uh refrigerator 
[00:35:30]  dumped like behind my apartment building and it's been there for like uh a month yes sir and uh i'm  just wondering you know how can i get rid of this what should i do and the second the mayor would  actually start addressing it okay sir um you know we're supposed to uh have these things on the street  to put out and then they get like okay i'm on the phone with the mayor now it's my chance it was  cordial for you know you know it's been there for two weeks sir like everyone copped an attitude at 
[00:36:00]  the guy after they realized he wasn't going to hang up and it really was the mayor like the smallest  little problem so it came down to this if you got through to the show the mayor was going to help  your stupid problem fix your problem and you could be calling to have have him solve really big problems  in new york but it was spent oh yeah please how about you know open it up a lane here or this  or tolls or something but it's always all right um getting queens uh my street in queens here there's  been a pothole and you know i back out of my driveway every day i fall into it i tell us where 
[00:36:30]  it is we'll send a crew over and it was like it was like it was like a lotto it was like a lotto  because if you got through the problem pretty much got fixed like he would address the problem  need a new roof on my brownstone yeah i will send over a crew so we're gonna do a little of that  with elo for a little while here what the hell right it's the ask the boss segment every ask the  boss you know ratings are really bad in terrestrial radio when they go to that bit right it's like you  have a bad book like many stations in new york had yesterday by the way oh really oh yeah oh boy 
[00:37:00]  trend came out oh boy our our former employers are not having a good morning too bad jack uh oh jack is  is done you know you know when any w is the bright spot for what does that tell you that's like the  highlight yeah of their uh their uh it's sort of like it's sort of like asterisk asterisk oh by the  way but any w is doing really good now well it's because everything else has come down below it  so no but no you know it's bad when it's the ask the boss segment uh before we move on the black girl 
[00:37:30]  show that might happen this saturday midnight there's a poll up on foundry music.com right now f-o-u-n-d-r-y  music.com should black earl have his own black rock coalition show and the instant feedback is  coming in like crazy we deliver keggers from east meadow i can't wait to hear two hours of ghost  busters by ray parker jr steven from bayshore we may steal your music girl but you guys steal our  property also from steven who's very obsessed with this whole thing the show is going to be diverse 
[00:38:00]  unique and short but you know what this is where earl's not even thinking it's like call patrice and just  throw out a life vest and go help wow see see now that's what programmers think of it's like why  don't i go get patrice to help me with my black rock coalition sit in right yeah but that's a smokescreen  because you know in the end patrice does he has no desire to do that show you know it was so funny  my cell phone rings in the middle of the buccaneers game um uh and it was patrice and so i didn't even 
[00:38:30]  know i didn't recognize the number so let's go to voicemail leaves me a like three and a half minute  message just like he does on the air just rambles and it goes it goes from everywhere to thank you  for the call it's very very kind i got a thing about you know the radio i'm not sure how i'm  supposed to suck up to the boss i mean it went it went all over it was remarkable he did some great  radio he's the best people are uh instant feedback uh uh really freaking out about uh opi's announcement 
[00:39:00]  now that elo is here okay they want to know arch enemy arch enemy uh and they're freaking out i got  hit i got hit yesterday at a lunch with a very very senior reporter of a newspaper really who hit  me with it yesterday ah so i mean this thing is like permeated into the bones of society yeah very  nice we could end with that are we allowed to announce it today uh not today but probably maybe  tomorrow jesus man come on already hey you can't hate me anymore the boss i'm gonna do my drew rosen 
[00:39:30]  next question yeah because people think i'm teasing this along look you heard from the boss you can't  hate me anymore it's the real very angry no in all fairness so the pests understand because they all  you know i get the emails too yeah um opie we were gonna do it friday we didn't have it it was not  done so it was not opie when one of his little games he's playing it's real so what are you guys  talking about exactly you don't know no all right you don't want to know because it'll just it'll keep  you up at night i'm gonna save you the trouble hmm it's not very nice part of the show i just 
[00:40:00]  really just went through the whole rolodex of all possible scenarios it's not going to keep me up  tonight all right sorry love bill in fact i don't even give a shit now all right he's making believe  he doesn't give a shit todd pennsylvania what's up good morning gentlemen this is this is ask the boss  yes uh elo it's uh very special you to bring anthony his door today oh yeah is that why you're in town 
[00:40:30]  to hand deliver my door the doors and my carry-on luggage elo actually did take care of my door problem  i made a phone call to elo after many phone calls to many other people i needed a door for my srx and  uh here it is uh tuesday i believe the door is scheduled to be delivered to the collision shop  tomorrow and it will be put on my vehicle immediately and i should have it by uh friday there you go back  again thank you elo you're welcome see he was solving problems how many hours did you spend how many 
[00:41:00]  hours did you spend on anthony's door elo about six hours six hours and i know there's an announcement  coming soon yeah it would have been made already but yeah he's a little behind that's right well  you know something i'm thinking well i feel guilty a little bit i'm just thinking it probably gave elo a  little a little departure from the normal part of the day it broke up the monotony yeah the monotony  i'm sure your job gets a little monotonous like anyone else's and this was a whole other avenue to 
[00:41:30]  kind of pursue it gave him uh an opportunity to finally get to know you there you go to take a  phone call from me isn't that awful i just called when i needed something that's okay because i assume  and believe me i have nothing but the utmost respect for you uh personally and professionally  and i just my stupid problems or anything that happens uh around the show i don't want to bother you  with it and i appreciate and i figure if it's serious enough you're gonna get this guy on the phone  he's gonna be calling you and really should crack crack burying you shouldn't use the word serious 
[00:42:00]  in front of elo though uh what word could we use that word's not in his vocabulary critical critical  critical is a much better word to use let's say hi to wade in toronto a faithful listener of this  show my deal wade he listens to xm illegally yes uh wade you're born and boys good show good show  elo serious question i'm not gonna joke around i've been listening to xm for over a year i'm hooked up  through wisconsin is it possible to get when when xm canada opens can i bring my xm radio up to canada 
[00:42:30]  legally you know what i don't have an answer to be honest with you he doesn't have that answer  i actually don't know uh that's uh that's that's one that's one of those things where you defer to  the legal department because i know if i say something i go to jail right i actually actually  i don't know the answer to that question what's up with xm canada when does it start uh we've we've  discussed that the service will be up before the end of the year just in time for the holiday season  and um and it is uh i've seen the channel lineups and uh 202 high voltage is going into canada very 
[00:43:00]  good so uh so all your canadian friends will hear this show and this channel and the black rock  coalition unfortunately no no we're gonna get that done legally in canada yeah can we get it before  the canadian that's no problem and jim norton called you personally all obsessed about xm canada  absolutely called me at dinner last night uh and my cell phone said little jimmy yeah and all he was  just worked up into a lather just yeah breathing heavy you know how he you know he gets all short 
[00:43:30]  breath oh yeah and it was all about canada well what do i need to do you know he was getting he's  crazed so i said yes you're going into canada and he's like okay and he hung up the phone it was  bizarre well he was convinced one of his sick uh rants that he right that he did on our show  blew the whole xm canada deal well it certainly got their attention let's let's put it that way  wow oh man is he going to be paranoid and actually i didn't hear the rant live somebody else did and  i was told to turn the radio on at that point i'm like oh okay it's that good so yeah well and he 
[00:44:00]  called ben last night because uh he found out that kato kalin was in studio oh he melted down he uh yeah  i know how he thinks he is really pissed off at himself that he wasn't in studio to get a picture  with kato kalin crazy photo guy i'm not even hilarious he's mad that he's doing a television  show in l.a you know bill knows as well right that's no but that's how he thinks right now he's beating  himself up like why why did i have to be out here for hbo i could have been in studio to to get the kato 
[00:44:30]  kalin picture to meet peter brady that's bad where's ben get ben in here real fast that's what he's all  about though he's he's crazy like that the best thing in his life happening right now an hbo tv  series that he's part of and he's worried about coming here he's worried because he missed a  photo op with kato kalin and that's how he thinks in his in his brain in his sick little head he can't  reason with himself and say well unfortunately because you know because i'm doing this hbo show  and i'm out in l.a i'm gonna miss some of these opportunities so i told ben i'm like dude do whatever 
[00:45:00]  you can to get an ex-president in this studio before before jimmy returns because he will lose  his mind yeah jimmy card is uh he's got a book yeah let's get jimmy card in here a lot of press  great freaking jimmy will lose his mind yeah that's what i hear who else i mean really who else did you  read it yeah i read it you did yeah it's a great book i like jimmy yeah big fan of his how can we get  in here that really puts him over the side though i mean what is that would do it an ex-president what if  i brought ozzy in before his scheduled appearance ozzy he's already met he already did like it would 
[00:45:30]  still freak him out actually already did somebody like paul mccartney would like he would yeah that  would freak him out of paul mccartney denaro thank you denaro eric yes yeah bobby denaro if you could  get denaro in here just to come in say hi and walk out yeah step in walk out that's it he will  lose the name of the lead singer of uh in living color something glover yeah corey corey glover very good  yes but if we could get denaro he would be in a in a straight jacket oh yeah what did you know

[00:48:30]  a lot of you know uh you know tv shows that like the reality world and all that doesn't play well on  satellite radio so we just we parted west people want to know when the blink and you'll miss it  channel is coming to x i think it's on this saturday night at midnight actually let's go to tom in  kentucky tom hey how you doing boys hey tom hey uh elo uh i really love the uh college sport channels but  uh are you ever going to get the sec on there we're working on that yep i mean those contracts are uh 
[00:49:00]  contracts are in force right now but as soon as those negotiations open up you can rest assured  we'll uh we'll be talking all right let's say hi to chris in pennsylvania chris hey how you doing  i have a question for elo yes i want to know why channel 171 is not online 171 171 the trucker's  channel why is it not online why it's not online well you know because sometimes you don't have all 
[00:49:30]  the rights to stream certain shows and when you have a channel that has a bunch of different shows  you have to cut deals with each individual provider to get streaming rights and if i can't get  all the different streaming rights for one channel i can't put them all up okay that's  steve summers the clear channel right what's that that's uh steve summers yeah yeah but it's not  it's not it's not his choice it's more of a corporate decision i mean i mean you've got uh phil  mac you've got nemo and you also have uh the truck and bozo that's part of xm that's right 
[00:50:00]  yep so why can't we just bring those and just keep uh steve summers off well because it actually  we have to actually build a whole separate channel just to do that okay is there any inflammation uh  implement for in the future inflammation you know any inflammation you're feeling  actually my knee's a little sore from last night there you go sir your questions have been answered  yes i will work on that i will i will make a note it's a good question by the ice that knee down  that's right we got uh i'll work on my inflammation we got tj from whack bag can you please ask elo to 
[00:50:30]  just turn off channel 152 since it's just a horrible channel with awful hacks wow ouch i couldn't agree more  actually say hi to brian in tennessee brian what's going on good morning fellas hey brian hey uh question  for elo i noticed that uh nhl channel only has five channels to it yes and it'll put show games that  are coming up when there's actually games on that evening are there contract rules with each team 
[00:51:00]  or are you guys going to expand it well no we're going to keep the five channels we'll have uh i  think there's twelve thirteen hundred and forty games across the season i think we'll have almost  eleven hundred games okay and so what we basically have done is spread out all the games uh evenly  between all the teams and even when there's a game going on we'll actually show with the next game  on that channel is coming up so that all kind of rotates on the uh what's called pad data so when you  guys look at the radio the technical term is called pad data so that rotates he's got an answer for  everything he certainly does you're welcome uh elo we started a new bit yesterday where we use a bull 
[00:51:30]  horn out the window oh do we you have you have no problem with that right absolutely not all right  thank you there we go there you go came from the top clearance top i love it check that it's a great  bit actually people loved it yesterday actually uh if we could isolate elo saying yeah i have no problem  with that uh so anytime we ask a question we could just play it on the replay here oh very good and  i can hit it and and we do it we have it on tape as elo saying fine well uh really fast i i discovered 
[00:52:00]  living in new york that you throw anything on the sidewalk people will pick it up you know i started  clearing out a lot of the stuff in my apartment old clothes and old cds old dvds and i just left it on  the stoop thinking no way will anyone pick up this crap some of the cds didn't even have cases anymore  everything was everything wow every single thing i i threw out there even the dumbest things  they took so we started that bit uh yesterday on the sidewalk of new york and what'd you put out  there uh just some stuff a couple items a couple items dvds i got a whistle yeah whistle uh i think 
[00:52:30]  it was a uh a frozen ham and a bat boy lives t-shirt i have a uh a demo of the black rock coalition  it's we could lay that out there maybe a couple other items yeah maybe they shouldn't be brought  up anyway and finally elo before you move on to do your big deals today yes sir uh anthony and i want  to thank you for the shopping spree yesterday what you got you're not wearing what this is not your  outfit no no of course not what did you wind up although this is my problem with my shirt this is 
[00:53:00]  my broadcasting outfit right like it it's your uniform i like it it's uniform yeah we went on a little  shopping spree we went all over manhattan in a uh stretched limo we had uh dinner on the uh lunch  on the company i would think if we went to soho it would have been a little more discounted i know  that those stores are pretty expensive but it's more you know it's not as expensive probably as  the places we did go elo i gotta tell you uh a lot of money was spent but did you feel good though 
[00:53:30]  when it was all said what did you uh certainly what was my budget yeah what was the budget for a  clothes for anthony and i think i said um i told wiki you know spend your two to three hundred dollars  to buy some clothes uh-oh that's one pair of pants  did we outfit the entire wardrobe now well i mean see this is really not sure what jeans i'm gonna  wear today for this photo shoot so you bought eight pair of jeans well three three and one had to be 
[00:54:00]  tailored because they were a little too long yeah yeah i had to tailor one of my four pairs and if you  buy a pair of two hundred dollar jeans of course you got to get them tailored you don't want them  a little you don't want them too long not off the rack and then the shirts i believe uh there were  three shirts purchased at about a hundred bucks a clip yeah easily between 80 and 100 well you know  how this was sold through right i mean this is how this is how it all started it was like we're  gonna do a photo shoot because the last photo shoot we weren't happy with yeah and you know we've  got the big billboards and soho and everything so yeah i didn't like those either it's like we 
[00:54:30]  we don't like those photos and so and so and so wiki's like well i'll just go take them shopping  i'll go great idea you know so why don't we just get a car and let's go buy him something for the  photo shoot by the way you know what that means we dress like slobs yeah i know it's the point i've  been trying to make no no that's wait wait i i gotta say something opie dresses like a slob  no we don't you look like you have a night shirt i wear it's not a night shirt it's like something  ebony's a scrooge would wear to bed with those sock hats look the last publicity shot is right 
[00:55:00]  behind anthony am i dressed like a slob in that picture no look how dark it is when i have to  see half your face i bet that the real color of that shirt was horrendous it was a black shirt  it was a pure black shirt it's the same black shirt opie brings to every photo shoot all right  so i needed a couple of lines you needed a couple of different ones did you buy another black shirt  yesterday i got a pure white shirt and they told me look you know for what we're doing  you can't wear white doesn't work and i'm like yeah but just in case so i got one of those too

[00:56:00]  shirt against the white background oh or else we'll be you know they have none to follow like a head  yeah just make a square block like the weather guys a bad chroma key back in the 70s you know  like muted out all of a sudden half their jacket disappears but we didn't want to take their word  for it so we got the white shirts right because they looked good will they be coming with us on the  photo shoot today no no because then we decide after we got home that obviously it's not gonna work  yeah but someday we want black background in a photo shoot you have the white shirt hey now we  got to go shopping again that's only got 120 sneakers because you know you want to look good

[01:01:30]  bust that a shame she's gonna be of a huge loss uh when she goes over to the uh other company by  the way yes to do something yeah so uh i just wanted to explain something eric logan yesterday  it was announced that xm has a huge national ad campaign a xm commercial anthony being shown all  over the place yes and uh you should have taken a shopping like a day earlier a day earlier because  i got to communicate just as i was stepping into my first clothing store yeah and oh goes oh okay 
[01:02:00]  now i get why this is going on like everything adds up in opi's head of course everything adds up  you were actually you're you're giving you're giving us a far too much credit that we're that smart okay  we're not part of the national ad so they're letting us uh and they're giving us uh some uh local  publicity and market publicity around uh logically it made sense to pick up the hundred dollar bottle 
[01:02:30]  of uh black cologne you bought cologne wow was it the new polo black uh uh yeah that's oh no no the  uh uh kenneth cole the balls oh yeah i had the blackberry in my hand i kept reading the announcement  i'm like yeah i'll try on another pair of jeans oh that white shirt that i'll never use in the photo  shoot no i'll buy that when we were at sax walked up with like i don't know a couple of pairs of  pants a couple of shirts and stuff walk up to the register and uh i start looking around i'm like 
[01:03:00]  where's wiki like like and i'm almost looking like i'm going to pull my wallet out like yeah i'll get  this and then and then wiki comes over and i just backed right off because what i don't understand i  don't know i don't know i want to i'm curious how the money is going to work so wicklin put all this  on his credit card uh well he's here ask him so he's going to float oh he's not even going to move  look he's right there panicking now and now he's freaking right so this is what's interesting  because hey if it's even half of what you guys have said yeah if it's half of what you said in

[01:06:30]  webcam in here what is the story on the webcam i mean where where is that gone we have to talk to  steve about that uh don is giving the international sign for money well given what you guys spent  yesterday that might have been the webcam yeah you're wearing the webcam later the webcam's on your  cufflinks hey i don't know how much the limo costs but i know we spend well over five grand  no problem wow wow problem that would do a webcam that's that's a that's a web that's a webcam higher  done higher higher higher than five well that's two webcams higher than five g higher than five 
[01:07:00]  wow punch it out guys oh all right thank you uh i just want to know something for my own  peace of mind here if i would have even attempted to have that leather jacket paid for by xm because  i did pull out my own credit card for a couple items that i just there was no way in hell i thought this  is ever going through if i would have popped that up through would you would would you have put the 
[01:07:30]  bill would you have paid for it on that uh credit card no no eleven hundred dollars so look how brave  he looks in front of the boss he's like what was his criteria i mean at what point did he actually  ever say opie you shouldn't get called did he know there was this kind of unspoken rule like i knew the  leather wasn't going to go over right i was actually going to buy new luggage i was actually i was looking  at the kenneth cole luggage set i was like damn that's good luggage it's bigger than the ones i have 
[01:08:00]  and i was ready to just wheel it over and say you know come on xm hey i travel a lot for the show  i need luggage i need i need to some place to carry all these shirts to carry the shirts and the leather  jackets i'm buying and the pants well you only gave him like a 300 budget so i mean you gotta throw the  hammer down and say he's responsible for the other 47 he is well that's what i want to figure out i want  to figure out where the approval came from i don't know but i don't know he and by the way and again i 
[01:08:30]  i don't know how he if it was five i want i want to see him float five is it going to be on his right  it's on his credit card he's got five g's for at least six to nine months months until that's how  long it takes the reimbursement comes through all right elo uh he's he's fidgeting in there he looks  like a snitch right now yeah he's got dry mouth he can hear it sweating what about the cubicles  when when do we get this place oh that's a good question uh that actually when you guys come down to dc  uh one of the meetings is with uh big tony big tony who has schematics and we kind of outline what 
[01:09:00]  you guys want to do out here stage and has there been an idea of uh what yeah we we want to do and  they they kind of know yeah tony to actually what tony wants to do is turn this into a place where you  can bring bands they can just plug right in it's wired it's mixed and then we can actually broadcast  from over here do we get our stripper pole like we talked about you get you're ripping me off now robin  well we came up with that did you see in the newspaper and then our lounge do we get the  lounge where we sit around and just read papers for the first break there it is let's just take 
[01:09:30]  what was printed in the newspaper they actually had an artist's conception of howard's studio which  is everything you talked about it was exactly to a t what we had said we wanted this to be once the  cubicles are removed everything stage the pole the band area the lounge area where we could say the  nice subdued club-like lighting do you guys know anything i mean i know you're very similar you  guys are like robin do you want the boom mics have you seen the new boom mics that we use down in dc 
[01:10:00]  the little headset thing yeah we'll do those yeah those are actually really good i don't know you  into the boom mic thing i was making my coffee band and i wasn't able to tell you this before it went  on the air so i'm gonna say i'm gonna say in front of everybody now yeah uh i'm hearing that uh the  boys from uh the frank uh channel frank's place they don't want to leave they don't want to leave  they love it here and i was uh uh let's just say i was taken aside and was asked to help that  situation along help him help the situation for them staying no you were taken aside i was basically 
[01:10:30]  somebody came to you in a dark i swear to god this is a this is a true story all right i was pulled  aside and someone told me that they could use my help use your help well i'm really gonna say that  but in getting them out of here like they understand that i'm a real ass and i can make people very  uncomfortable oh this person hinted that there's a few people that don't want to leave right and they 
[01:11:00]  suggested that maybe i uh make it very uncomfortable uncomfortable for them in my to be here in my fine  way oh i got you get them out of the building i swear to god this was an actual conversation i had  just before i went on the air is this the same person that maybe uh i'm not i can't say gonna  be putting in expense reports i can't say no no no no no no no for 5200 dollars i swear to god they  said that somebody doesn't want to leave because i guess this is very close to where he lives or 
[01:11:30]  something right there he can't walk two blocks right there he's only moving two blocks oh boy there you  you go then move us over there that'll be close to my house there's a there is a there's a design  where we're going to do every listen if you guys do half of what you want to do right they'll be out  of here well i'm not kidding this was a conversation that like you know and i'm like oh for once you  want me to be an asshole yeah i could do that we've done such a good job and of unwinding the  asshole chip yeah and now we're like encouraging him you know what doesn't work it's like somebody in 
[01:12:00]  rehab it's like no seriously try cocaine again this time it won't be as bad i swear to god i had this  conversation my eyes lit up because i love this stuff he goes uh some of the boys have been uh  discussing this behind the scenes and they uh they uh told me to come to you and suggest that maybe you  can make it a little uncomfortable around here again maybe you can make it a little uncomfortable  basically we've been too nice to people around here and they want us to go back oh boy to the other  way well no one could be here it can't just be like one cubicle left while we have every all this 
[01:12:30]  other stuff going on because it defeats the purpose you'd see that all around new york where  one guy won't sell so there's these massive office buildings all over the place with like a little  house underneath an i-beam holding up the rest of the building the whole building's like built around  it yeah yes overpass hey he can stay with his cubicle but the stripper pole goes right through his desk  but then you know one of those rules that we have where we pull the curtains down in here when 
[01:13:00]  shenanigans you're going on yeah uh then you know it defeats that purpose we'd have a problem  everyone's got to go we got a clean house all these cubicles zero tolerance zero tolerance everyone's  gone all right let's go to scott oh that's it now see that'll be a meeting i want to attend yeah  that's what that very good and i have your agenda coming uh next week so oh oh boy is there an agenda  more more than just that oh yeah it's scheduled out lunch working lunches you know working lunch  it's that doesn't there's no such thing let's say hi to scott in virginia scott what's up fellas 
[01:13:30]  hey how you doing good hey elo i was just wondering i saw the uh xm channels on direct tv this morning  and i was just wondering if there's any plans and you know maybe add any album covers or anything a  little more exciting so it's just a black screen yeah it's all it's all we've worked to get this  thing up so fast that uh i've not actually seen it but i've seen the mock-ups of what it's going to  look like and it's going to have uh album art it's going to have websites it's going to have uh news  information so it's going to be really cool so at this point you kind of slapped it together  we just we we pulled it just wanted to get it up we want to get it up there asap asap that's right 
[01:14:00]  and then they'll uh they'll pretty it up for you scott nice it'll look it'll be visually appealing  all right i'll add pink rizzo is a god punching out all right very good all right i guess uh we got  some of the questions answered there you go hard-hitting questions we want the webcam now we got to figure  that out yeah well i want my five grand back but that ain't gonna happen okay there was sort of a  there was this unspoken rule though well that's what i want to know i want to know was there parameters 
[01:14:30]  given none just walk me through because i know the i know what i was told when the idea came to me  so when the idea was presented to you how was it presented it was we're gonna go shopping  because you have a photo shoot on uh uh so they say that everything you have sucks is basically  what he says you dress like a slob and we don't like what you have it was that's in essence what  it would have been interpreted that way it could have been more like we know what we're going for  here and what we need and instead of looking in your own wardrobe for something that fits let's just 
[01:15:00]  go out and buy what we know will work but there was never a conversation of like we want to buy  an outfit which is how i would phrase it an outfit for the photo shoot it was kind of go shopping for  a couple of things things yeah a couple see there wasn't this direct like this many things we're  gonna buy oh you don't like if i took you shopping yeah i said i'm gonna buy you a piece of luggage  yeah that would be like one suit one one suitcase not an assortment of a hanging bag a vanity bag 
[01:15:30]  i need two big suitcases and a smaller bag right i need three pieces but if the guidance was  a piece of luggage a piece of luggage you would know that they're buying one yeah probably the  more expensive right and then you'd buy the rest yeah so this was like we're gonna go shopping very  open-ended see i knew there was no way i was wearing that leather for the photo shoot so that kept me 
[01:16:00]  from bringing it up and trying to have xm pay for it you know you're just but everything else the pants the  shirts even though they're plural here i'm saying pants and shirts i knew that they would all  probably be used during this photo shoot or a photo shoot in the future or yes a photo we'll  probably do a little costume changes opie there'll be changes done yeah my stuff will never be used  uh during this photo shoot today no no and you're lucky that uh i was very tired yesterday i wasn't  as motivated no i think we could have got away with murder yesterday that's because you were bloated 
[01:16:30]  i was bloated blueberry morning i was lean on me yesterday today's blueberry morning  someone's suggesting tomorrow op try pound me in the ass great from kellogg's thanks a lot  pound me in the ass flakes oh the fiber i was buying you up like a wicked friend oh my god  it was brutal yesterday all right eric logan fist me where you off to now uh actually i have a

[01:34:30]  front of the building maybe angry janitor will come out and get it all right i still want someone to  puke oh by the way because i i was thinking about this this bit we did yesterday i think we need to  do it when bill burr is in the house yeah so uh jimmy's coming back what monday for a couple  weeks he is so i think we should do that same bit friday it's unorthodox i gotta tell you saying  we're gonna do the bit again friday okay yeah before you leave for a couple weeks because i think it 
[01:35:00]  worked well with you so why not why not sure and then we'll rest it for a couple weeks usually we like  to throw a bit out there and then we rest it for a while but why not why not let's go right back to  the well we'll do this that bit uh again on friday we got to come up with some good items okay yeah i  hope our pals out there again too because he made it fun of course well we got we got to think of  something how to provoke him yeah yeah we'll figure it out there something to get him out there some  sort of stain on that sidewalk that he needs to mop up something he needs to mop up which i'm thinking  the puke thing i mean if somebody if we could get somebody to just ralph right there on the sidewalk 
[01:35:30]  he's got no no yeah know what i was thinking i swear to you and you know me i was this close  because we arrive when no one is on these streets huh and i had one brewing man i had one brewing what  a dump hole dude yeah let's just put it this way it ended up almost three feet almost three feet long  why didn't you take a picture and win the contest that's never going to happen because i why didn't 
[01:36:00]  you bring that up because i wrecked my digital camera when i was on vacation oh really it was  in my bag when it was raining and i thought the uh the stupid x games bag we got would protect stuff  from the rain and it didn't so my digital's uh done do you have the audio of you discovering that  your camera was ruined i was so bummed out actually i like that camera so now i got to get the best buy  and buy a new one so the lean on me cereal makes a nice size dump my god i don't know what but  i was just i was debating this this morning coming a little early no one is around and just 
[01:36:30]  just you know take a dump on the sidewalk he would first of all he would absolutely know who did it  you think in his whole history over there of mopping i'm sure he's never had to come out and clean  that up yeah i mean it's not really an area where you find dumps like that yeah i think what would  give it away is as he goes to clean it up the three of us are screaming with bull horns kind of let  him know what would you yeah clean up that crap faggot come on get your mouth now clean up that 
[01:37:00]  fucking big piece of shit all right so we're trying to come up with five really good items for friday's  gag all you got to do is shit in a bag that way light it on fire and ring his bell no no no you  shit in the bag because i'm saying at any point there's always going to be somebody walking up to  you so you shit in a bag yeah and then you just casually walk by and turn it over right on the  ground and then you walk in the building you got to be subtle like our boy danny i was going to  say get down like you're tying your shoe right right and then just dump it out uh bert from philly 
[01:37:30]  opi's colon is baking bread because the lean on me had a yeast infection thank you uh all right bill  we got to get into what you found for the the program yeah oh yeah this website and and and and  how you discovered it it started with a hollywood actress or something right yes scarlett palmers  she's some girl from that show reba which i didn't even know existed reba reba i don't know  if i got that right is that show still on oh i have no idea that a wb show or one of those 
[01:38:00]  yeah isn't that on right after caroline in the city  i really don't know if reba's still on the air so uh is it ever on the air i couldn't tell you um  anyways yeah so uh i guess this girl she went down to 73 pounds whoa and she did it they said by  going onto the internet and visiting pro anorexia websites which i didn't know existed there are  pro anorexia websites out there anorexia is good kind of like the nambla thing yeah 
[01:38:30]  fucking children is is okay it's a good thing yes here's where you can go and get the support you need  to continue doing this yeah so i went i so i googled it and like the first five websites were  all like uh saying these pro websites and pro anorexia things were bad and then i you know  i got to page two of the google search yeah then i got into the dirt and i got all like these uh these  topics of these anorexic girls like trying different techniques to get down to 68 pounds they trade 
[01:39:00]  secrets these little uh tried and true methods of losing weight you want to hear one of these yes  all right here's one of the topics chew and spit all right what do you guys think about chewing and  spitting i just started it this weekend and i love doing it because i can taste it but not really  ingest it i know you can still uh you still get some cows cows yeah cows she's so starving she can't  write the whole word oh i'm exhausted yeah there's no capitals that shift button it's got to weigh 200 
[01:39:30]  pounds of them but she goes uh get some cows but i just eat normally and spit it all out so it's like  nothing i just wanted to hear what you got your guys opinions on it then they just go back and  forth on show guys and they just discuss what's that and then then they just go back yeah they go  back and discuss it kind of like uh hey the patriots are playing the dolphins what do you think well uh  did it get a thumbs up or a thumbs down though isn't the whole chewing spitting thing a lot of a lot of 
[01:40:00]  a lot of people like to chew spit because you get to taste the food and there's that whole type type  of thing but it seems like the jack and without uh ejaculating it's yeah and then you don't have to  puke it up so you don't you don't uh you don't uh burn your esophagus out yeah and kill the enamel  teeth yeah there's the back of your teeth problem there but it is it would seem to me like it would  be like jerking off without coming like swallowing the food it's pretty much the gold coming without  getting a disease is that it i'm thinking more well the whole the the satisfaction part of eating 
[01:40:30]  isn't just the taste of it it's getting full it's feeling like you've eaten something oh you're just  chewing and spitting but you're getting the taste let me try all right you're gonna choose there's no  way as a normal person to do that all right anthony is now chewing i didn't even go out and tell  i know what it's like it's like beginning to fuck some uh a supermodel and and not finishing 
[01:41:00]  even though she's saying it's okay right if you want to finish you can well i need the garbage pal  hawk hawk are you awake today why don't we uh film this chewing and spitting all right oh this is  disgusting all right so you're chewing what are you chewing by the way don't spit it on the sidewalk  are you chewing one of the elo muffins that he brought in today crump cake how long do you  chew until you feel like you've got everything out of the out of the food i'm already getting 
[01:41:30]  nauseous you gotta suck all the goodness out is what you're doing and there goes the spit  all right let's get a how do you feel how do you feel it do you feel satisfied like you had a donut  i was kind of good i think i could drop some weight that stinks that method you get what are you  missing you're missing the goodness of it being in you but but the hell  save that you fuckers got mine the other day you better fucking mark that one of course i forgot to 
[01:42:00]  tell you guys i'm walking out yesterday right honestly these are working against us on a daily  basis and i want to call them out right now you're saving that right do you honestly think i don't say  that and know they're gonna fucking jack me with it later but stupid me i'm not thinking right so  after we were doing what we're doing after the show i'm leaving and i hear from the production  room which is the last door you you walk past before you enter the real world and steve's got 
[01:42:30]  a promo he's working on uh cranked up right and all i hear is my voice perfect time as i'm walking by  has anyone smelled my ass around here all out of context and it's gonna be part of this brand new  promo they're working on oh they don't even tell you they just have a little pad somehow i know your  cereal is going to be worked into that of course the gay cereal yeah somebody smelled my ass yeah no but  yeah they don't have the subject all of a sudden it's just me saying hey has anyone smelled my ass around 
[01:43:00]  here and they i know i'm saying a million times so now you got a few versions of it great but they  have a little pad every time you just say something over the top gay they write it down that can be  taken out of context yeah so you just said that it feels good to be like goodness inside me or  something yeah i'm sure they'll use that  you know he leads to his feet save that save it fuck this guy over that's right i'm not gonna be 
[01:43:30]  the only one in the barrel you know when you chew something like that and uh and don't swallow it  your body is still gearing up to digest but what about the second you put something in your mouth  and start chewing it right your stomach starts like the acids start in so that's really got to be bad  like now you're just bubbling this cauldron of acid with nothing to digest inside you except for uh  your stomach lining that's probably really bad too yeah it gets your body all ready ready to rock  you know when you're standing on the subway platform you think one's coming and then it's 
[01:44:00]  the express and it goes right by yeah yeah you're like oh man yeah another 10 minutes when you got  to take a leak or dump really bad and then you're you pull up in the driveway it gets 10 times worse  because you know it's like right there ready to rock all right so uh your body preps thumbs down on  the on the chew spit huh thumbs down all right girls you gotta just puke all right why don't we uh  continue there bill that's what i'm suggesting so the first topic was chew spit these are great topics 
[01:44:30]  the next topic of discussion the uh the topic of discussion is i'm disgusting these are like topics of  the thread i'm disgusting i'm disgusting this is going to turn into my new favorite website okay  here here it is i can't tell if i'm happy or miserable another five pounds slipped off the scale  and i cried not knowing which emotion to feel i'm so hungry yet the thought of food disgusts me  i ate today and i was threw up in class because i was so disgusted by the thought that something was 
[01:45:00]  being digested inside me that i had put something in myself that would only make this pain worse  i'm sorry if i sound pathetic with a u i just really needed to vent  these things are unbelievable and they all just support each other and but it's not in a way to gain  weight this is how to lose weight oh yeah they they give each other pointers but you see 
[01:45:30]  she feels like like she seems like she doesn't want to lose weight and she feels disgusting  no some of these oh because she digested something because something was actually  inside her christ yeah something was inside her digesting  what about the next one there bill next topic i hate scales  this morning my weight was 121 before peeing before peeing before peeing like you're gonna 
[01:46:00]  i mean what kind of piss are you taking well right now it's 4 p.m and it's still 121  but i've had two cups of coffee two cups of green tea four cups of soda one cup water and a lot of  gum gum i ate about 100 calories last night as a binge what is that's like a handful of cereal  yeah about 30 calories of gum today what is that like when the sugar gets in your saliva and you 
[01:46:30]  actually swallow a little it trickles down your throat they keep track of like uh calories and tic-tacs and  all that crap as well as two servings of jello and a sugar-free popsicle i didn't know that existed  that's like an ice cube isn't it making my total 160 i'm kind of happy kind of scared happy that in  the morning my weight might be less if i'm 121 right now with all this fluid in me i think i've uh 
[01:47:00]  only gone to the bathroom once or twice today scared that it will still be 121 in the morning  or even more and that i really haven't lost any weight also i can't tell if i'm retaining retaining  fluids my stomach is puffy my face is puffy my rings are tight my thighs are a little bigger as are my  boobs i just started birth control who's fucking this girl really a week ago 121 pounds 121 she's a fatty  for an anorexic yeah so if so if i lost that water weight maybe i really have lost weight 
[01:47:30]  i'm trying lean on me cereal tomorrow fit day fit day and this forum are really helping me i still  chew and spit we start another lingo and eat at night every day but it isn't a much smaller quantity  creepy creepy girls they have pictures man i i this looks fake but i i guess it's not 
[01:48:00]  this woman it's two girls and they're having a little fight with a hose in their bikinis  and that's one of those enema hoses i bet to clear her out to lose more weight lose more to get rid of  the grape she had for breakfast and the only word obviously the only thing that comes to mind is  concentration camp uh victim that's what she looks like absolutely disgusting supermodel uh concentration 
[01:48:30]  camp yeah this is like their supermodel their version of like if christy brinkley went to auschwitz  yeah that's what she would look like she got like every joint on her looks like a newborn thoroughbred  like a newborn foal yeah you you see her superior bone structure right everywhere the high cheekbones  the pubic bone every bone is exposed there she's a living skeleton did you read uh binged again or creepy  as hell uh-uh binged again had huge binge friday fasted yesterday and felt really good about it today 
[01:49:00]  i was going to fast again but was nauseous so i ate about a hundred calories still felt okay then  tonight i ate a real meal and it set me off on another fucking binge what the hell is wrong with  me fatty i keep coming close to my goals and then blow it i need help last weekend i had three binges too  she can't take it she's not going to be a successful anorexic you're binging because you're starving 
[01:49:30]  yeah why why do i binge what's wrong with me i keep eating and then creepy as hell i did the same  thing and i binged friday uh too but it but i did today i can't read this because the there's so  many damn typos what's wrong i'm trying that dizzy thing they're dizzy but i'm trying that  thing i add a bunch of tom's hope it is is she trying to say tom's  yeah it looks like it all right forget this one it's all over the place you want to hear a real 
[01:50:00]  creepy one yeah go ahead this is called uh making love this is some guy who's into these really  anorexic girls he goes i swear this is his truth but making love to thin girls is really and truly  better for me mainly because i think they enjoy it more i guess food is a no-no other sensations  become more amplified as a guy i've only had one anorexic girlfriend in the past about five eight  and 110 pounds i guess the fun part was seeing me in her if i had her at the right angle get the 
[01:50:30]  fuck out of here the rest of my girlfriends have never been more than 120 125 pounds i mean what the  fuck is wrong you could see how what would the angle be like probably her laying back on the bed  right maybe you standing up on the side of the bed with her bony legs hanging over the edge of the  bed and you're standing up on the side so that you get a lot of like no rub on the inner side of her  abdomen no what backward cowgirl 
[01:51:00]  how would you see it when the spinal cord cannot look around the spinal cord would get away around the  corner back around the corner you're looking at her back when you're doing the backward cowgirl  cowgirl with her leaning back no i say no the the bend in the dick doesn't hit  backward cowgirl no yes absolutely not who's with me absolutely i'm gonna have to disagree 
[01:51:30]  why because the bend in the dick isn't right and the rubbing on the outside of her on on the inside of  her abdomen isn't and the spinal cord would obstruct your view yeah no i said you're not looking first  of all i think what he means is you look from the front not the back you're not seeing her your dick  through her no you lay her on her back and you just do it like missionary style and it'll be almost  look like this there's an alien being underneath her bush but maybe you got it yeah exactly it looks 
[01:52:00]  like oh it's so creepy it looks like aliens ready to bust out from inside of her  yeah that would work yeah if you kneel like down or missionary and then kind of pull yourself up to  look yeah oh he could probably jerk off while he's still inside or just go right around her waist and  just kind of give it a couple of tugs let's say hi to jason in texas jason morning boys hey  i was wondering if these chicks when they're giving head do they chew and spit yeah keep the chewing part 
[01:52:30]  out of it chew and spit very good i'm sure they don't swallow though they probably think of that  as being calories it's protein yeah well we're going through the website we're getting more uh  i haven't been able to find the the website we'll give out the link to everybody in a little while  for the ones that need it spilled out for them others have found it they probably are easy though  like this guy if you if you troll that website the support website and you know chat with them a 
[01:53:00]  little bit you could probably pick one up i bet their self-esteem is in the shitter you know that  right from the start yeah i i think i agree with uh dion i was gonna say this the missionary position  modified a little bit dion from uh arizona yeah if you put a pillow under the back you probably see  a dick coming through the stomach oh yeah okay arches are back a little bit with the pillow under there  now you're talking all right yeah yeah i'm checking out all right i i think we found the uh the position  so okay creeps i like how that actually became a real discussion yeah well if you put the penis in 
[01:53:30]  all right we'll get more from the website in a little while also um we're trying to hunt down miss uh  uh miss senior america no we're not her name is halpin what halpin that's not a name h-a-l-p-i-n  that's her first name first time ever seeing that name that's an old lady name halpin mccarney 75 she won 
[01:54:00]  miss senior america and her quote it's a relief it's stressful it takes tremendous courage to do this  why i don't know we'll get into that article as well after the break all right  whoa whoa whoa what do you got you got another one yeah my boyfriend hated my body when i was 93 pounds  i'm five foot seven wow but he loved the whole caveman thing if i talked back to him he would 
[01:54:30]  just throw me over his shoulder and walk into the dorm building in front of everyone and just throw me on  his bed he also liked picking me up when i was sitting at my desk and studying chair and all  i can't tell she's laughing or coughing and when i was depressed or crying he'd give me airplane rides  which was basically picking me up in his arms and spinning me around oh he's not that bad he likes 
[01:55:00]  my body much better now at 120 pounds 120 yeah but he can't really do much of that stuff anymore  she's still real skinny yeah her boyfriend needs to work out so he can still pick her up she's dating  a pussy and it's making her become uh an anorexic that's probably why he picked her up so much  because he's probably like nothing as far as muscles go yeah it's the first time he could carry a  girl across the threshold me bag of bones listen here's the deal something are we gonna do our fat 
[01:55:30]  chick eating contest i want to i'm very psyched about this can we do it like next week before  thanksgiving it's it's a good tying tie-in to thanksgiving i i just know we're gonna have a hard  time finding girls girls are a little self-conscious we need five girls to come in here and eat as much  food as uh as possible big ladies between the hours of six and eleven o'clock five straight hours  of eating and whoever gains the most weight we weigh them in before and after weigh them in after 
[01:56:00]  right whoever eats the most whoever eats the most wins what where are we gonna find girls that'll do  this well you don't think we'll find fatties there's the problem there's the problem  i said big girls you said fatties see yeah that's such a big difference we need  we need girls there's like a solidarity like kind of yeah i remember that girl from the practice or 
[01:56:30]  something won that award uh-huh this is for all the big girls yeah and they all yeah if she said this  is all the fatties crickets yeah they wouldn't clap big girls or fatties we want see now why do you  gotta be mean big girls will show up but maybe a fatties won't show up maybe a really hot thin girl  that just knows she could gain a lot of weight in five hours knowing that she'll just puke it up  after the show and she's back to normal oh you want that like the eating contest girl because she's 
[01:57:00]  skinny and she eats a lot i'd say it's why don't i got one why don't you get a bunch of anorexic girls  in here have them binge see who can binge the most gain the most weight well that'll be exciting all  we need is one one thing of tic tacs olive i you don't think they're gonna eat more than that  for five hours they just kind of stare at the tic tacs trying to trying to get brave enough to grab  one that's a wonderful contest these are great ideas for bits why don't we have terminally ill 
[01:57:30]  patients race down a hall with their iv pulls whoever doesn't get here we go whoever's iv is  still in their arm here we go let's start with heather heather yeah you'll do it i'm gonna throw  myself under the bus and do it all right heather how tall are you five three and how much do you weigh  two oh five there you go five three you're two oh five a true fatty our first time no she's a big

[02:03:30]  oh brownies what do you make them or you buy them no usually i work for uh i work for a doctor so  you know the the drug reps come in with junk food every day the drug reps come in with junk food oh god  yeah they're like feeding you they make you fat and you feel like you have to eat it because it's  there is that their mo so they can then later sell you like anti-cholesterol drugs and heart medication 
[02:04:00]  and fat people stapling drugs and exactly that's it's like the chulies guy from uh clerks  the chulies by the way the prize for the fat chick eating contest that we're trying to get  together here we have one contestant so far her name is heather she's on the line uh the the prize  is uh plastic surgery what are you serious like a makeover thing what what shecky sparks just came 
[02:04:30]  in with that plastic surgery do you have a big old gut the french bulldog of comedy  plastic surgery in what way i thought you're a hockey puck  plastic surgery plastic surgery maybe they mean lipo or something i guess i don't think lipo works on 
[02:05:00]  fat people no because the right works on people that lose weight but then have like a spot that they  can't kind of get rid of right like that secretary thing the spread yeah or the belly they gotta use  like a wet vac not a shop vac because the home depot shop vac all right we're gonna have to find out  a little more about this but the uh the prize is plastic surgery that is like the most general thing  you could say that's a term that they don't even use anymore plastic surgery that could cover you know 
[02:05:30]  a nose job or having your foot replaced plus it also is much more accurate on what you look like  you know what i mean as opposed to cosmetic it makes it sound like it's going to be beautiful no plastic  plastic all right well we got our first contestant heather uh we're gonna put you on hold all right  yes stay on hold don't hang up and we'll get your info and um that way we can get in touch with you  all right let's say hi to michelle in virginia michelle yes what's up well i want to know what's 
[02:06:00]  the weight limit because i'd love to have some surgery what um how big do you have to be in order  to be a big girl well how tall are you i got a chart here yeah five foot seven five seven so she's uh  five seven relatively tall for a gal 197 yeah all right go ahead give us that weight 151 this morning  when i stepped on that scale that's not that bad at all bad for uh her height you're a big you're 
[02:06:30]  a big girl though right uh uh uh five seven 151 that's actually uh it's a little maybe a little above  average yeah but i mean it's not like tall like model tall and then skinny like that like she's a  big not fat but she's big yeah what's the problem the most damaged i think of uh like hour that  i've been on this radio really you're just feeling badly about yeah this is just horrific we're  mocking the anorexic which i'm not no i'm not you brought it i did no i'm i'm a part of it all 
[02:07:00]  right michelle yes so what's the problem mary on you my belly your belly yeah how many kids your radio  how many kids how many kids did you have none no kids how old are you 30 did you ever eat one  i'm sorry i'm gonna apologize i know you're just are you gonna commit or not i know i can't  are you gonna commit to this hate radio or not come over to the dark side it's funny it's a

[02:08:00]  she's probably you would look at her if she walked in a room and you'd be like you know that's the girl  that's on like the basketball team or something or you know she's uh five seven one fifty one i  don't think it's that it's i think she's like  big like she would walk in and look like a big girl  not fat not saying fat let's go to stephanie in new york like daisy fuente is big 
[02:08:30]  stephanie like a thick girl thick all right listen guys good we got we got the girls coming to the  table now we got stephanie from new york she's five seven 133 pounds and she's saying she could  out eat anyone now that's no problem well we should have different weight classes what the hell just  throw them all together stephanie yes hi are you uh do uh gentlemen consider you hot um i don't know  my husband does ah and you want to eat have you ever gone outside the relationship for sex 
[02:09:00]  um honestly yes you have yes how how uh recently like within the last six months  was it just oral or did you uh penetration everything everything wow and your husband knows  yes and he and he his response was um he wasn't too happy about it we split up for three months but 
[02:09:30]  we're back together now and i told him i'd clean up my act to be a good girl are you yes are you going  to continue have you have you felt weak at any point that you're going to go back to your old ways  no who's the guy um i can't honestly say how'd you meet him well what was your relationship yeah  bang the guy in the next cubicle over while at work co-worker no was he married no he had a 
[02:10:00]  girlfriend and i just called her up recently and told her and now we're good friends you're  rest why would you do that because it's the right thing to do no the right thing to do was to not do  it to begin with and then you don't tell everybody so you can feel better oh okay that's the right  thing to do i shot him in the face but then i told everybody i did it because it was the right thing to 
[02:10:30]  get down wow it's not i want to know if i win this eating contest what do i get plastic surgery  as in what like bigger boobs or something what's your problem area what do you plan to do with those  bigger boobs ma'am i don't know maybe impress my husband oh is that why you cheated good answer  is that why you cheated you you weren't getting much action uh at home what was the problem oh no i  was getting a lot of action at home just not what i wanted something tells me impressing your 
[02:11:00]  husband would be keeping other men's cocks out of your mouth like can you honestly what why did  you do it just uh well she wasn't getting what she wanted at home what was that she wants something  different yeah well what well what did you want stephanie different cock was a different uh different  cock or a different way um it really wasn't all about the cock it was more emotional  ah female females are very emotional creatures we don't always want sex there are some of us out 
[02:11:30]  there like me that like sex but you just wanted to be you know cared for and and felt like you were  wanted oh do you never notice whenever they cheat they always have like these good valid reasons  rather than you just wanted some emotional some different dick i wasn't getting it high but i just  want to be loved all right if he had raked the leaves a little more then i wouldn't have had that  orgy that's what it was it was his fault well you know i told him to take out the trash when i left my 
[02:12:00]  husband i had my first g-spot orgasm so it wasn't all a bad thing oh wow you never had one with the  hubby huh um he's given me one since we got back together of course he has he wants to keep you in  the house wow yeah i'm getting two selfish cunts and a cheating whore on instant feedback no but if  he wasn't if he wasn't doing it right though but if the dude wasn't doing it right i mean guys do that 
[02:12:30]  yeah if you got a girl you know you love her and everything but she's awful in bed eventually you're  going to go outside the relationship so if that's what she did i can kind of understand it oh now you're  understanding yes okay because i think they're just like us yeah as far as like the whole cheating  you ask girls about as far as like them cheating if you really get a girl to be honest they say 60  i've heard everywhere from 60 to 75 percent of them go outside the relationship at some point because  they're not getting uh what they want at home no just because they fucking want something different 
[02:13:00]  the same as they're just as dirty and filthy as us but they're a lot they're such better liars wow  big time that's frightening well do you guys want stephanie the uh the cheater part of the contest  yeah hey and how did the husband give you the g-spot orgasm when you got back together  um he's given me a g-spot orgasm with both his finger and his penis oh hey what what was the scene can  you paint the scene when you told him was he did he suspect something what what why did you tell him 
[02:13:30]  um actually i gave him a heart attack oh that's good an actual heart attack yes why is there glee in  your voice when you say that wow what's that you kind of seem like there was a happy tone in your  voice as you actually i gave him a heart attack what when you told him or when you were cheating or  you're just aggravating yeah he was like really stressed out and then when i actually told him we  got into a big argument and he ended up in the hospital and they told him he was having a heart 
[02:14:00]  attack wow and it all started with always and forever always and forever why don't they show  these kinds of women on oprah no shit now he's the moron guy why can't we get a selfish whore like  this woman next maury povich if you've cheated and given your husband a heart attack call maury 
[02:14:30]  stephanie is he a nice guy though in general he's wonderful wow man he didn't deserve that shift wow  you guys were dancing on that dance floor on your wedding day yeah he's gonna die sooner now  well he is ten years older than me so i guess he will probably die before i do well you hastened it  by giving him a heart attack nice turn down your radio stephanie that's a slight delay there  that's fucking everybody up back do you have anything you want to say to your husband yeah 
[02:15:00]  you want to give a dedication to the man you give a heart attack yes walter i love you very very much  and i hope that we can have a life together and you can forgive me for what i did say what you did  this motherfucker man is working his ass off in bed to keep you satisfied which means he's that much  closer to another heart attack the first time he doesn't give you that g-spot orgasm you're out  the door this guy has got flop sweat on 24 hours a day trying to satisfy this bitch he's probably had 
[02:15:30]  like performance problems right flop sweat jesus did you come right really don't lie to me you  fucking hard the pressure this guy's got to be feeling oh wow he doesn't take viagra he takes  like heart attack meds blood pressure meds the nitro under his tongue he's probably on a blood thinner  for his heart he's on viagra to get enough blood flow he's a mess because of you 
[02:16:00]  well he seems to be doing better now oh he hasn't had a stroke this month  all right do we want stephanie and we have to have stephanie in the fat check eating contest  even though she's not fat she's 5 7 133 pounds okay can you come in next wednesday stephanie  um i don't know i got a big girl versus cheating whore yeah you don't know why come on  come on no what are you doing no i don't know if my husband would approve what what happened i

[02:28:00]  see good for me so so stay close and you'll find out i'm right down the block all right kenny  thanks for listening we appreciate that you got it he'll come by with some cookies for the contest  next week all right we got lazlo in studio uh really fast um steve just handed in a piece of  production that's going to go into rotation in the very near future yeah next monday when jimmy's back  it's the new ona show intro wait wait you mean when the show opens yeah this will play instead of  i'm jim norton and i'm on the radio well eventually that one well there we're always updating those and 
[02:28:30]  and eventually what we're going to do is we're just going to rotate all the show openers so it  gets a nice little variety and people don't get sick of the show opener sure remember how long the  saint pats some people come to saint pats to pray all those are coming back too really rotate all of  them yeah it seems come up with like 10 of them already but here's the new one that's going to be  this is the one that's going to be on the radio for a while yeah until we figure out what to do and  before we start rotating all of them the only reason i bring this to everyone's attention is because 
[02:29:00]  of that rant i just did about uh these asses isolating the homo lines that we do uh-huh right  take it out of context the next thing you know you sound really really bad well that line is in  this promo so i guess uh because we talked about it a little while ago it'd be worth playing really  fast let's hear listen to this where do people turn when they have lost everything when a cruel  catastrophe has taken everything they loved and cared about in life where do they turn when they're in  despair it's show time folks it feels good it's cool we're brilliant broadcasters i'm thrilled i'm 
[02:29:30]  excited i'm ecstatic very respectful very nice there is some shenanigans going on it just feels right  they're like two puggles we want perfect questions we want some laughs some thoughts being provoked and  thrown back and forth i don't like flaky i like cakey i want to hug a cute dog how fake was that the name of  this radio show should be the happy idiot and the sullen douche two total dorks am i listening to a 
[02:30:00]  radio show two djs and a tranny lover that's what this program is about mister only creeps listen to  this program go boys what's happening man anyone around here ever smell my ass it's lovely come on  we're gonna tell you how to get chicks james i'm jim norton and i'm a horribly boring person  we just kind of laugh at him he's getting better but uh we've got to break him in still he's a 
[02:30:30]  candidate for killing his wife he gets married i love e-rocking with a console that's us  snapple and mayo your dumps must be lovely and featuring hurricane ben  martini steve i think there's a degree of mental illness with everybody on the show  ramon ramon ramon eric's breath smells like the diaper of a cancer patient  can i say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick i got a few ideas they could get us  fired please use them please use them hey steve not bad man wow steve that's the new show opener 
[02:31:00]  very good we'll start monday for a while that could be the longest one of those i've done so far  really yeah yeah hey we got no problem you make them four hours long okay  come on and just go take it easy see you tomorrow you know does none of us have any complaints about  that the longer the better the less we work the better we feel all right very good good job bravo  that's steve i think steve feels a little uh competition a little pressure with uh pal laszlo 
[02:31:30]  who uh comes in here with some fine production you guys start that shit and then it blossoms on  these fucking message boards and then laszlo and i call each other up and looking at these  things going can you believe this shit stop reading the message boards oh yeah the message  boards actually uh think there's you know sure they think there's a big like uh butting heads  going competition and a little tension do that they wouldn't jump to any conclusion of course  not then why would they do that message boards are usually rational thinking body of people of 
[02:32:00]  course they don't just take a bad idea and run with it no no speculate uh for months on end about  things they aren't completely full of shit if some like comment is just thrown out there on this  program regardless of how sarcastic it was said they don't pick it up like it's fact and run with it and  i love it when i i'll make a comment on my show just an off the cuff comment and that comment will 
[02:32:30]  be isolated show up on whack bag and then there's a whole thread on it yeah oh yeah and i'm like dude  it was it was a joke dude to calm down they're like comic book nerds your fans are like comic book  nerds and they and every little component every page they're like i didn't like the inker on episode  five page 42 was a little out of context they're they're worse than comic book nerds because  comic book nerds don't get acknowledged on a national forum and then they're not written 
[02:33:00]  about in the comic book yeah yeah true very true these are comic book nerds with a little bit of  publicity and then so and that that makes it exponentially worse what the hell is the kevin  smith movie where they went around to jay and silent bob strike back and they go to all the  messages and they just knock on the people's houses at the doors and punch them in the face when they  answer the door that is so fucking like how great would that be oh it's so many people and they  had a whole printout of all the posts and they're reading them and just knock on the door and this 
[02:33:30]  12 year old opens the door and they just punch him in the face that's what we should do get a bus  put steve on it yeah we can hunt people down they can knock on the door yeah okay you posted this  on a july 20th exactly by the way my production sounds like shit compared to laszlo by the way  these two are working together yeah yeah yeah he actually did a voiceover for uh that's why it's  funny when they when when they smash him and smash me busy because he and they're on the phone you know  trading notes and shit like i heard the kid in there too yeah what is this all about um one of 
[02:34:00]  these commercials that's in the new grand theft auto liberty city stories uh there was a voice  over and i said i think i will have steve do the voice what is liberty city stories about isn't it  just the old game no it's uh an entirely new game set in uh liberty city so it's actually set before  grand theft auto 3 yeah it's the prequel to grand theft auto 3. yep i just figured that out too recently  so why isn't there a buzz on the game i don't know i hope there is i'm waiting for the check i thought 
[02:34:30]  they just kind of repackaged the old games no not at all they they do this is another grand theft auto  game yeah it's a completely new story for psd for psp but that's probably why and that's why a new  platform yeah it's a new platform that a lot of people you know not as many people have that that  have uh computers in their house not that many people owned a ps2 until gta 3 actually i mean right  that the game really drove sales of the platform and they're and sony's really hoping that the same  thing happens with this yeah because it's expensive i mean platforms in general the new xbox is going 
[02:35:00]  to be 400 you could get a dell computer that'll pretty much run any game for that maybe a little  more these days and the thing that's not because the new xbox comes out next week and there's like  a 300 version that doesn't come with a hard drive and a 400 version that comes with a hard drive but  the 400 version is the only one that can really do all the things you want it to do yeah because and  the 300 version isn't backwards compatible so if you own a bunch of xbox games they're useless to 
[02:35:30]  you on the new platform why they put a hard drive in these things you're at the point now get a  fucking computer right right why are you getting a gaming platform that is in essence a computer that  cannot be upgraded or uh you can't get other games that are available for the other platforms that are  available on a computer i i don't understand why you're doing it so those uh pcs will play all the  games even like the regular and more or the most part they're starting to make some which pisses me 
[02:36:00]  off they're making these exclusive games that are just xbox exclusive hate that one of these is that  fucking game far cry right these bastards should be shot they put this game out far cry they they took  advantage of the fact that uh the newer doom i guess it was doom three yeah and half-life uh two  were delayed not coming out all of a sudden out of nowhere this game far cry comes out graphically  beautiful the gameplay was fantastic and this game sold like a motherfucker on pc right played it 
[02:36:30]  steve uh uh turned me on to it it was great game now far cry 2 comes out i go oh let me order it  not available on pc only on uh xbox like these motherfuckers the only reason there isn't one  uh a two that's coming out for this game is because the computer people went out and bought it  and now they're cutting off all the pc people probably because they know that the computer  audience is their main core they want to drive all those people to buy the xbox yep it's exactly 
[02:37:00]  what's a marketing strategy right i'm not i'm not doing it though i'm not buying it fuck them  even with the new i don't understand microsoft's marketing strategy well actually i do they  typically throw stuff out there and then just let the public beta test everything um yeah with  with the new xbox even if you have the 400 version and want to play your old games you have to download  a patch from microsoft and put it on your xbox like i said why didn't it just come with the  fucking thing ready and backwards that's where sony wins because they make their platforms backwards 
[02:37:30]  compatible and for a while there were rumors that microsoft wasn't even going to make the xbox  backwards compatible which is stupid it means all your games are useless and now gaming  platform people like xbox ps2 things things like that three whatever they're up to these days  uh are going to be welcome to the world of patches it used to be with a console game there's no patch  the game had to fucking work when they put it out computers are always fucking with you they will  put a game out just because it's got to be on schedule they'll put it out knowing there's glitches 
[02:38:00]  problems that that are gonna the game's gonna crash whatever knowing that we'll just put a patch out  we can get the game out on schedule we'll put a patch out in a few weeks a month and that'll take  care of it now platform games same thing you're gonna get your games you're gonna be playing them  they're gonna crash it ain't gonna work ah the patch is going to come out get a computer right  you're welcome you're you're in the same hell you might as well just get get a computer unless  the course the game that you're playing isn't available for a computer yeah and then you won't  be able did you see that the dungeons and dragons people finally woke up and they're 
[02:38:30]  finally coming out with a game actual after every other right kind of game ripped off the concept and  successfully has been doing it for years they're right on the ball they put a they put a press  release out and said that 4.6 million people still play dungeons and dragons in the united states  which i think that's horseshit no i don't know anybody that still plays dnd what is the concept of  that game um you sit around with a bunch of boys in a room a dark room and pretend that you're dragons 
[02:39:00]  and slay each other with your swords yeah you're like yeah like what are your knights and your  characters like you would be in any kind of video game is it like shoots and ladders i mean it's over  and like no it's not a board game it's not a board game i've never played it but i know how it works  shoots and ladders and there there are like these die that you do it's a 20-sided 20-sided die with  different numbers on it and stuff and you roll it and depending on the number it's how much you would  just hit somebody for yeah damage and damage hit points but then there's what's called the dungeon 
[02:39:30]  master that kind of weaves this story so the game isn't set it's not like football where there's you  know the rules regulations football parameters the four innings and all right and the camel toe  exactly and the intersections right all right parameters that have to be stuck to this dungeon  master can just out of nowhere pull these fucking oh and now this thing just flew down and hits you  for you know it's like his and so how do people go crazy playing that game to be the dungeon master 
[02:40:00]  is like to be the mac daddy of the fucking crew there because it's up to him uh who actually  succeeds and fails uh and some people never make dungeon master and i guess they get upset and kill  themselves or yeah people have their characters their characters they play for years and then their  character will get killed off and there's been people suicidal like my imaginary friend is dead or you  gotta kill the dungeon master right the game takes years well you can if you're involved with your  little there's online games that have taken years i i've i've had a character in an online game for 
[02:40:30]  five years now for five years i've had one character in everquest and what's he doing right now right  now what is your little guy doing right now he's camping  i'm gonna sneak into your house and run a magnet right down the back of the you try to sneak in  my friend i'll decide whether i use the wilson 12 gauge or the fucking ar you know what i can see  it in your eye you don't have it in you 
[02:41:00]  he's standing there with the weapon and a fucking puddle of piss underneath him  hey we're gonna back up just slightly all i'd have to have is some sort of urban accent and  that would be it you just stay in the bed just leave okay hook i'm gonna hurt you i cook  we're gonna back up slightly stephen lynch has a great song about uh dungeons and dragons oh yeah  we're we're featuring stephen lynch a lot today but uh his songs are coming up in conversation so  listen to this really fast

[02:44:00]  Up down!  Thanks.  Steven Lynch, ladies and gentlemen.  It's Mark Tike.  There you have it.  Very, very good.  Big Cab wants in on the conversation about D&D, by the way.  Big Cab, what's going on?  What's going on?  Please make it fast.  I think we talked about D&D a little too much already.  I was actually calling to talk about Star Wars Galaxies. 
[02:44:30]  And how they're dumbing it down, practically, to a platform or console version game,  rather than the glorious, in-depth game that Anthony and I have enjoyed.  They have changed that game about three times so far.  And I mean major league changed Star Wars Galaxies.  When it first came out, it was supposed to be a Star Wars version of EverQuest, I guess.  They kind of did a good job.  I liked the game when it first came out.  But they had a major overhaul about a year ago, I guess, where they changed the combat. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, they changed the combat.  They changed the classes.  I mean, they changed everything.  And now they're doing it again.  And I guess they're making it like a first-person shooter.  But actually, it's still a role-playing game.  I don't see how that's going to work.  And they've trimmed out all of the intricacies that we liked.  And all of that stuff is pretty much going away. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, the people that play these games, and I'm one of them, I like a lot of detail.  I like the option to have a lot of things to do.  If you get bored just grinding out, hunting something, you could go back and do what they call the crafting,  and build up your crafting points, and buy and sell things on the market that they have.  And they're kind of doing away with some of those little details.  And I think they really are going to have a problem keeping subscribers. 
[02:46:00]  And what makes this one pretty sinister is the fact that they announced it two days after their current upgrade  that people paid $30 or $40 for went live.  Yeah, so people buy the upgrade, and then they announce they're changing the entire game.  And then how about this one?  You bought Jump to Lightspeed, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, so did I, and now it's offered free.  So they got it.  They made people pay.  This is like cell phones.  Yeah.  They're never going to catch up. 
[02:46:30]  Absolutely.  And they keep changing the game.  You do what I do.  You quit.  Just quit?  You quit.  You keep playing Asteroids.  But what if you spent years building your character up to Jedi?  By the balls.  To Jedi status.  Now you can't just quit.  Sure you can.  The gaming company is the crack man.  Yep.  He's got you.  I think macros are going away also.  Macros are where you can just sit there and kind of program your computer to play the game  for you.  Thank you for explaining, Anthony.  And do certain little tasks.  Half our audience just turned off their radio. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  A lot of people play games.  You'd be surprised.  Wah!  Got to dumb it down a little bit, though, Big Kev.  All right.  Big Kev is a very, very intelligent person.  I'll never deny that.  Highly intelligent.  Thank you.  Midway's selling.  All right, Big Kev.  Isn't he just informed?  He's extremely informed, and he lives in a world that I can't relate to.  It's a world of comic books, video games, and C-list celebrities at some of these big  shows that they do at convention centers.  He lives in Nerdsville. 
[02:47:30]  Is he a LARPer, too?  Christian Slater does a guest appearance.  Christian Slater, it's more like the guy that played the giant in the episode of the  Twilight Zone to serve man kind of thing.  And he'll be signing autographs at this convention, sci-fi convention.  Big Kev will be excited about that.  He has, like, Jawa No. 3's autograph.  The Star Wars characters are huge at those conventions, and it is.  It's like I was Jawa 3 in the scene where Luke was buying R2, and, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  There's a whole crew of people that are now making Princess Leia metal bikinis from Return  of the Jedi.  And if you go to the website, it's leasmetalbikini.com, and it's, like, dozens of chicks that are,  like, dressed up like Princess Leia.  How awful do they look like that?  And some of them have gunts.  Of course not some.  All.  We call them gunts?  We call them bunts.  Oh.  You go with the gut?  It's the gut above the gun.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Captain Obvious. 
[02:48:30]  We knew that.  We just went the other way.  Why does Bill Burr have, like, a wine box of coffee sitting next to him?  No, that's from Eric Logan.  It's a craft.  Okay.  It was in our office.  A box of coffee.  All right, getting back to this.  So, Steve and Lazlo are working together.  By the way, I just saw Liberty City's on the PSP.  It looks amazing.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Yeah.  I'm going out today and getting a PSP.  I just played a little and was very surprised at the way it looks and the way it plays.  Very good.  I have no interest in playing it.  You see that PSP with all the traveling you do with your comedy? 
[02:49:00]  That would be perfect for you.  What's that?  That would be perfect for you.  It's a game you might enjoy.  It's on the new Nintendo.  It's called Nintendogs.  You can have your own puppy, Bill.  Raise it.  I have to, like...  Yeah, you raise it and feed it.  You know, I got one of those recently and I was looking at games to buy and I saw that  puppy game.  What the fuck is that?  It is because Nintendo is getting smashed by the PSP.  Absolutely.  So they are putting out a game for girls.  Because no reasonable man is going to sit here and pet a puppy with a fucking stylus. 
[02:49:30]  You have to pet it.  A little slay a dragon.  A bunch of...  Yeah, yesterday I named one Chester and you can actually abuse the dog.  My character right now is building a roads garden on my PC at home.  My macro.  Here is someone who doesn't understand gaming.  Fucking nerds.  Wait, Bill.  I mean, I'm with Bill on that one.  You don't understand it either.  I have been bored shitless for the last half hour.  I understand.  That's why I'm trying to, like...  But you guys don't understand it.  I know they've got these games that you can't use on your PC, but you could use on your PlayStation. 
[02:50:00]  I'm petting a puppy.  All right.  Go ahead.  Talk fucking basketball for ten minutes.  We haven't.  We haven't.  We haven't.  We haven't.  No, you haven't.  And we have not.  I've heard you guys talk about basketball.  We have not.  And you'll see more audience go, ugh, than with video gaming.  Listen.  I want you to find that clip.  Yeah.  And send it to me.  Basketball?  I don't know anything about basketball.  And by the way, there's some tension between you two today.  I'm loving it.  You've got a lot of nuts.  You've got a lot of nuts. 
[02:50:30]  It's all show business.  Giving people shit about the clothes that they wear.  When I was hanging out with you a week ago, you were wearing not only an...  No, you were wearing an iZod, but not just a regular iZod, a counterfeit iZod.  Oh, yeah.  I bought it off the sidewalk.  I'm walking out of a sushi place.  Next to a Bat Boy t-shirt.  And I was literally looking at it going...  What makes it a counterfeit iZod?  I was looking at it.  I was going, does this look real?  It was like 25 bucks, right?  And I'm looking at it.  The alligator looked a little too small.  The person I was looking at is going, no, no, that's real. 
[02:51:00]  That's real.  So I've been wearing it.  No one's noticed.  And then I went by the real, like, Lacoste store.  And I noticed I have an extra button.  I guess it's only supposed to have two.  You look close and it's actually an anteater.  It's not even an alligator.  I'd wear it in here and you wouldn't even...  It's a gecko.  It's an art bar.  Art bar.  I'm sorry.  It's much better.  It makes the joke a lot better.  I understand.  I'm just saying, and it gets to a point where it's uber geeky.  I can't relate to a game where you have to spend hours and hours to, I don't know, build 
[02:51:30]  arrows for a fight that may or may not happen.  That's when I stopped playing.  I know.  But the thing is, see, there are some subjects that because you don't understand it doesn't  mean it's not hugely popular with people out there.  All I'm saying, there's many levels of gaming.  There's, like, Bill, Asteroids, Ms. Pac-Man.  You are.  You are.  I do, like, Tiger Woods.  Let me tell you something.  You are probably...  I do Grand Theft Auto.  You are probably one of the most casual gamers right before someone who doesn't play games  at all.  Yeah, I understand.  You're barely in it. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  I'm entrenched way further than anyone should possibly be in it.  That's the point I'm making.  That's all.  And there's a middle ground there.  I don't think we've gone uber geeky.  I know when Laszlo's a guest, we will talk a lot about gaming.  Dude, I don't know what a patch is.  I don't know what micro...  A patch...  Dude, everyone that owns a computer knows what a fucking patch is.  I know.  Maybe that's why you had to throw away your last fucking computer.  That's right.  Maybe you would have patched it once in a while.  I was, like, trying to figure that out, you know, when you were a kid and somebody...  Oh, my God.  Somebody uses, like, a sex term and you're trying to figure it out. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Who knows what a patch is?  Other room, raise your hand.  What is a patch?  You know what a patch is.  Dude, I know most people know what a patch is.  I'm just saying that it's something I don't need to...  Windows send you a can.  Windows send you a can.  Trying to make fun of the Dungeons and Dragons people, like, they're different people.  Yeah, like, they are.  Like, they're not part of the same fucking gene pool.  What they do is cool, but the D&D guys are faggots.  It's like the Star Trek and Star Wars people trying to say they're different.  You're not.  Like, you're making fun of the airline joke guy.  Right, comic.  I understand.  I understand.  But you're almost a LARPer. 
[02:53:00]  I will never LARP.  You are almost a LARPer.  Right.  What is that?  That's somebody who's live action role-playing.  It's playing the video game.  He's close to being a LARPer.  Actually dressing up and going outside and beating you.  I saw your Halloween costume.  You didn't buy that for Halloween.  I could not LARP in that.  You're almost ready to go LARPing.  I would kill somebody.  I think you're almost there.  I would never LARP.  You're almost ready to LARP.  If someone ever sees me LARPing, I give permission to kill me.  You are going to be a LARPer.  At least dent another door.  Right. 
[02:53:30]  I will never LARP.  They run around the woods with, like, plastic swords and stuff.  For, like, two or three days.  They have full-on, like, camp-outs.  And they LARP.  And they have fireworks that they throw spells at each other with.  And they hit you with their sword and go, two damage, two damage, two damage.  And it doesn't even hurt.  So I guess the sports version of that is people who play, like, fantasy football and those nerds.  Right, right.  There's many levels of it.  I understand that much.  I'm not making fun of you, Anthony.  I know there's a whole group of people that are way into it.  It's not a group of people. 
[02:54:00]  See, even that you're condescending.  The group of people that is, I don't know, generating more income than Hollywood is lately.  I don't know.  Exactly.  More video game sales than all the movies put together.  I understand.  That's an exciting fact.  That's a massive, massive fact.  That's an exciting fact.  I didn't mean it to be an exciting fact.  Listen to me.  Tell me about this puppy game.  You're supposed to be here, I'm here, entertaining people.  And I believe I am.  I'm just fucking with you.  What is this puppy game about?  Because I got one of these Nintendo DS things.  I'm not sure if I like it yet.  I'm going to go out and get a PSP today. 
[02:54:30]  But I was looking for games for my Nintendo DS, and I saw this puppy game.  I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  It is so huge in Japan, this game.  And it's starting to spread like crazy in the United States.  But what's weird about Nintendo, they're still making, like, Pokemon games.  Who the hell is buying?  I haven't explained the puppy game!  You raise a puppy.  It's like the, whatever, the Tamagotchi or whatever.  You've got to feed it.  Thank you.  It's got a wireless signal.  So if you're walking through the park and somebody else has the same game,  your Nintendo unit there will bark. 
[02:55:00]  Let me ask you this.  And then your dogs wirelessly go to each other's machines and play with each other.  Let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this.  Can you starve it?  Yes.  Yes.  And that's a good game.  Yes.  And you can also train it.  You can say, sit, shit, dick.  And it will sit.  If you can kill the puppy, that's a good game.  I want to sit there and I want to watch it.  This game is going to become popular with the gay community.  Faggots are going to be walking around with this game.  Sure.  And if your dog barks, it's like a signal. 
[02:55:30]  It's going to be code.  It's going to be code.  You want the stylus so you can pet his little head?  Pet his head.  See what he says.  Is the volume up?  No.  Turn the volume up.  The bottom's on the bottom.  The volume's...  That literally looks like a...  Does he go...  Look at that.  Nothing's going on.  That literally looks like a compact case.  Like you're going to take a little makeup out of it.  Yeah, like you're putting on some eye shadow.  All right, wait a minute.  Why is it running toward the screen now?  Huh?  It's...  It wants to...  I'm not kissing the fucking screen.  Kiss it.  Kiss it.  People are kissing the screen when this...  Put his eye out. 
[02:56:00]  Look at...  Give it a little...  Put his eye out.  He's sticking with the thing.  Hit him.  All right, I'm going to try to...  Hit him across the nose.  I'm going to try to...  Here, turn the volume up.  Yeah, it's on the...  The volume's on the very bottom right there.  I hear him yelp when you hit him.  The volume on this thing is pretty...  Can you beat the dog?  All right, let me see.  Can you take like a rolled up newspaper and hit him across his snout?  All right, here he comes.  Stick him.  Look, look, look.  Ready?  Stick him.  All right.  Oh, he's sticking his ass up in the air like he wants you to mount him.  That is a gay dog.  What the hell is going on there, Ovi?  I told you, man. 
[02:56:30]  Stylous abuse.  Hey, look.  Whoa, it just jumped.  Okay.  This is stupid.  Right, it's stupid.  People are about 11.05 when you see the story.  Give me the dog game.  Well, what else can you do with the damn thing?  The dog game for chicks.  I don't know.  Nintendo FedExed me this thing, and the only one I've really loaded is the dog game, and  it was entertaining for about a minute.  Do they have any other games for that thing?  Boy, they're losing out.  I got the Raymond game.  I think they've painted themselves into a corner.  You know, they have...  There are so many...  They keep rehashing the same shit. 
[02:57:00]  It's like Mario 7...  Sonic.  Donkey Kong 85.  Yeah.  Just on and on.  For a goof, I wanted to buy, like, the old Mario Bros. game, because I enjoyed it growing  up.  Oh, boy.  I couldn't even tell you how to get it.  You go to the store, and every one of the Mario Bros. games looks like it could be the  original, but it's not.  You'd be bored in two seconds.  No, I just...  I ended up playing it a few years back.  Bang, bang, bang.  I played Tetris all the way to Australia.  Tetris?  From L.A.  It was fucking great.  Wow.  You're sitting there, and your eyes are on... 
[02:57:30]  Look, it's just like you're listening to A-ha on your fucking CD player.  It was available.  Were you completely blind when you got off that plane?  Yeah, no shit.  Wow.  Yeah, it was awful.  It was like a 23-hour flight.  He goes to the baggage carousel, and he's trying to rearrange the suitcases so they fall  into the right spots.  So, there's many different puppy games, too, I noticed, right?  Yeah, actually, there's three different breed versions you can buy, but the Zelda games,  those are...  Nintendo's making a lot of money off of those still. 
[02:58:00]  I'm going to bail.  I'm going to go right to the PSP.  20 years old?  I'm going to bail.  Yeah, because there's actually porn coming out for the PSP.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Who doesn't like to watch porn on plane flights?  And then get to...  Yeah, all the movies when you're traveling.  Fantasy football's not LARPing.  We did not say that.  Thank you.  There are guys that are a little too deep into fantasy football.  Totally.  Like, he'll bring...  Hey, you see that game with so-and-so here?  Yeah, he's on my fantasy team.  Oh, yeah.  Cool, yeah.  Great.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I know.  I'm like that with games.  I'm too deep in. 
[02:58:30]  I know.  But don't try to make it sound like fantasy football is any better.  Fantasy football is...  Because there are people that...  No, no.  That was my point.  I was saying it's kind of like the same thing.  Fantasy football is huge, though.  Irritating.  It's huge.  They're not even watching the games anymore for the actual team.  They just want to see how their players are doing.  How their players...  Hey, so bringing this all around, you and Steve are working together and...  Yeah, he did a voiceover.  This is actually in Liberty City Stories.  It's one of the spoof commercials.  All right.  Sort of making fun of the whole Nintendo rehashing monkey games. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Laszlo's great with the fake commercials for the Grand Theft Auto games.  Everybody was wondering if there was something on that puppy game where Opie could have kicked  him in the liver.  No, there wasn't.  His little stylus boot.  Find me a patch.  Good, right?  Yeah.  This is data station to approaching spaceship SST.  You are out of approach vector.  Please respond.  Please respond.  Oh, no. 
[02:59:30]  They're coming back.  In space, nobody can hear you cry.  He's back.  It's Space Monkey 7, the video game that swept through Japan and Europe.  Now America gets to destroy mankind all over again.  Ah, Space Monkey.  After a nuclear holocaust, the monkeys leave Earth.  But they return to destroy the dark simian research facility controlled by Dr. Chank.  Ah, Space Monkey. 
[03:00:00]  I stick those bananas up here as Space Monkey.  Find the fossils and not the ones in our game design department.  Discover your origins.  Give in to the beast within.  Garwin's dangerous idea just got worse.  It's fun, family-friendly apocalypse that will keep your little monkeys entertained for hours.  Ah, Space Monkey 7.  Space Monkey.  Wow.  That's a good commercial. 
[03:00:30]  Ah, Space Monkey.  Stick with those bananas up your ass, Space Monkey.  Anthony and I, and I just found out Ben also featured in the new GTA game.  Everybody except, uh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock's here.  You want to take it up with you?  No, it's cool.  It's cool.  Oh, I thought you meant E-Rock.  Ow.  Sorry.  Ow.  Why don't you want E-Rock in there?  Ah, we'll put him maybe in another game.  Wow, what's that about?  I don't know.  I just, it was pointed out to me that, you know, maybe that was on purpose. 
[03:01:00]  There's Ben, Anthony, Opie, Steve.  No, E-Rock.  Master Poe.  Are you, are you hurt?  Master Poe as himself.  As Master Poe.  Oh, I'm not hurt.  That wasn't you, that wasn't you posting on the message boards about it?  No.  Under a fake name?  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Laszlo?  Nothing.  Nothing.  This show's all about controversy.  Yikes. 
[03:01:30]  Making someone feel uncomfortable.  What do you got on?  Uh, the old E-Rock.  Somebody noticed?  Oh, me.  Of course somebody noticed.  You?  No.  Is there a problem?  No, I think there's a problem between Hawk and Laszlo.  Uh, well, I got the audio of Ben in GTA and myself in GTA.  We don't have Anthony yet for some reason.  Why?  I don't know.  Tell the listeners to find Anthony.  Rip it from the thing.  I think I overacted in mine.  Yeah?  Overacted.  Overacted. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, like you wouldn't believe.  You know, it's really uncomfortable to listen to.  The best part, the day that I had you guys scheduled to do the voiceover, I'm like, oh,  this is going to be a great day.  These guys are going to do a voice, you know, for GTA.  And I'm sitting there listening, and it was the fucking Opie-Jimmy fight.  And I was sitting there listening, and I'm like, ooh, I ain't getting shit done today.  Oh, wow.  That was the day.  That's why.  And I called Steve, and I'm like, so what's a chance of me getting a voiceover?  And he's like, mommy and daddy are fighting.  Yeah, this is, uh, I, there's something wrong with my, uh, my effort here. 
[03:02:30]  Well, first, it's Ben calling into the Laszlo show that's featured on GTA, the PSP version,  Liberty City.  Listen to this.  Let's hit the phones.  Yo.  Uh, uh, hello?  Yes, hello.  You're on Chatterbox.  What's that noise?  My name's Lenny.  I want to talk about shaving.  Oh, okay.  What's the trouble?  You got a weird rash?  Uh, uh, there's no trouble.  There's no trouble.  I just, I just can't stop.  What?  I love it.  And I realized something really important.  Oh, God. 
[03:03:00]  If you shave downstairs, he looks a lot bigger.  You know, if you remove the brush, the tree looks massive.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, man.  Now I don't have to get surgery down there.  I just thought I'd share that with a few people.  Come on, Laszlo.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.  Where do you get ideas like this?  Like, my mom said, uh...  All righty, then.  This show's going great.  Uh, this is Chatterbox.  What's ever on your mind, however big or small?  Just give me a call.  Lines three.  Well, you shaved downstairs.  You looked a lot bigger.  Go away. 
[03:03:30]  Please, stop calling the show.  This is Chatterbox.  Hello.  Please be a normal human being.  Laszlo, your show sucks.  Dude, you're going to get no argument from me.  Today's show is rubbish.  What do you want to talk about?  How come I can't eat people?  Okay.  Who says you can't?  Wait, were you a socialist or something?  Talk more about eating people!  Next caller.  That's Ben.  Ben did a great job.  Ben did much better than I did.  What's great is Ben keeps calling back during the show.  Yeah.  Well, he's featured during my call. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  I turned him into a...  Listen to me overact here.  LCFR.  It's freedom.  Freedom.  And like freedom, people are begging to take it away.  All right, we're back on Chatterbox.  Let's go to the phones.  Yeah, I agree with what you said about Vinewood.  That count has got to stop churning out heartwarming movies with kids and shit.  I tell you, if I see one more damn movie with ten kids and a dog in a wheelchair and some damn baseball championship,  I'm going to start killing people myself and blame it on Vinewood. 
[03:04:30]  Hey, that sounds reasonable to me.  Yeah, man.  It's like albinos.  They're taking over.  Okay.  Let's all have a huff of lithium and take a deep breath, all right?  Next caller.  Hey, Laszlo, you ever eaten anybody?  Oh, God.  Not you again.  Go run somebody else's show.  You fucking suck.  Line four.  You're on Chatterbox.  Hello?  I listen to your show every day.  It means a lot to an old woman.  There you have it.  Ben is a star.  Ben's a star.  Who knew?  That is so funny.  He's got attitude and everything. 
[03:05:00]  That'll be in the GTA Liberty Cities game for the PSP.  I wish I could have done another take for you.  Come on.  That's so overacting.  And Anthony, the part that he plays, if somebody actually refines it and sends it in,  is some guy that's upset that his avatar has turned gay in his online game.  Yeah.  We got Elo in studio.  Typecasting.  There he is.  How was the meeting, Eric?  Huge.  Huge?  Huge.  Ooh, that's good.  It was great. 
[03:05:30]  I think there will be something to talk about.  I think there will be something to talk about.  Well, there's a positive maybe.  Well, we left Elo about an hour and a half ago.  He was doing a meeting with someone that may help the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Yeah.  Achieve heights never considered.  Ooh.  Really?  Yes.  The elevator repairman here at the building.  Pretty much all the lines are the elevator here, by the way.  Is there?  It's like one elevator in this whole building.  I said, where's the stairs? 
[03:06:00]  They go, we have no stairs.  I said, you liar, there is stairs.  It has to be stairs.  It has to be stairs.  It's called a fire code, dumbass.  Yeah, there's stairs.  We could show you whatever.  We'll rack some heady love that.  It's going to be good.  Yeah.  So I need the two of you when you guys are off the air.  Today?  Yeah, just call me.  Well, we do have a photo shoot.  I know.  Try to squeeze me into your day and the depressing of your five pair of pants and your...  Hoping to nap.  What time does a stretch limo drive you down to the meatpacking district?  Well, funny you should say that. 
[03:06:30]  Funny.  Or ask.  Two o'clock?  Yeah, I think it's two.  So did we just hire the limo for like the day and a half from yesterday?  Probably.  Probably.  Did the limo go out to Long Island and pick you up this morning?  No.  Actually, I've stayed in town to take care of this business.  And you'll be seeing that hotel bill.  I'll see that hotel bill as well.  That's right.  Was that the room at the Waldorf Astoria that I saw you in?  No.  King Jaffee Jaffer's room or whatever it was.  Yeah, the royal suite.  All right.  So it went well.  So it went great. 
[03:07:00]  It was good.  All right.  Thank you guys.  I think the two of you will be pleasantly surprised and pleased.  Pleasantly surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.  And it still has nothing to do with the Arch Enemy.  So.  All right.  This is a whole nother thing.  This is a whole nother thing.  This is a whole nother bag.  And in the Arch Enemy, we'll talk about the Arch Enemy.  Oh, look at the commercial.  This is just like a goddamn comic book.  The XM commercial.  Hey, here's the XM commercial.  There it is.  Wait, I want to see me in it.  Snoop Dogg.  Hold on.  There's Alan.  There's Snoop Dogg.  There you guys are walking down the hall right there.  There's Snoop again.  More Snoop.  There's us.  Snoop walking down.  It's a very sharp looking commercial. 
[03:07:30]  Snoop saying hi to David Bowie.  David Bowie.  David Bowie is in one of the Snoop.  David Bowie.  More Snoop.  David Bowie.  And right there is My Fi.  Is My Fi to the O&A show?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm sure it did.  And there we go.  I'm sure it did.  It did, you fucking man.  Wow, we're right there.  Oh, look.  My phone's ringing.  I've got to go.  I've got to go.  We're on to your games.  Games.  We thought the company was stepping up with these billboards and these bus signs.  Oh, no.  That was to keep us calm because this was coming out.  A big national commercial that's running. 
[03:08:00]  That's hilarious.  You guys were thanking them so much in the week.  Really appreciating, guys.  Thanks for that black and white full-page ad.  We've got the full-page ad in the Daily News.  Oh, that was great for a day.  More full-page ads coming.  Billboards coming.  We've got billboards in the Albany Gazette.  That's a national spot.  How many people could possibly see a national spot anyway?  I mean, look.  I mean, you are sponsoring a few bake sales here and there.  Yeah, whatever works. 
[03:08:30]  Some church circulars that you're going to be in.  I say we stick to the grassroots approach with this show.  Don't want to go too highbrow.  No.  Word of mouth.  Now I know why you didn't write me back yesterday when I asked about the national spot.  Actually, my blackberry was dead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A grim day for us all.  A coincidence.  Yeah.  Give him his muffins back, Bill.  Yeah.  Take his...  Take your coffee.  Yeah, take your box of coffee.  Take your muffins.  Have any of the coffee?  I think someone had a swig.  I had a little bit.  Did you actually bring this?  Yes.  This is dedication to caffeine consumption right there. 
[03:09:00]  Big box of coffee.  You know what he brought?  He brought bread and circus.  That's what it was.  Bread and circus, huh?  A little juggling act.  Diversion.  Yeah, some donuts.  Yep.  There he goes.  That blinking blue thing on his ear creeps me out.  He is like the boar.  He is.  He just walks around.  Anytime he comes near a mic, the mic's...  He's got more electronic equipment on him.  He's going to have like a cell phone tower.  He's going to have a big tumor growing out of his head.  Oh, forget about it.  We're going to have cancer just from standing next to him.  Just from shaking Elo's hand. 
[03:09:30]  It's like a lightning rod for brain cancer.  Yeah.  He's constantly wearing the Bluetooth thing with the blinking light.  He's got 20 different electronic devices around him for...  He's got the Blackberry, his cell phones, all kinds of other little things that need stylus.  All right.  He's got one phone.  We've got Laszlo in the studio.  We're going to do a speed round next.  We've got to do some news or something that makes this show sound current.  We have to talk about Miss Senior America. 
[03:10:00]  And she did a rap song.  Of course she did.  Because isn't it adorable when old ladies rap?  Oh, that's the funniest thing.  They can't put that in movies enough for me.  All right.  Break this.  Also, we'll talk about the nasal sex spray.  And whatever else Laszlo has for us today.  Okay?  All right.  Okay.  Take it easy. 
[03:10:30]  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  Shit.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be right back.

Yeah, we don't want to confuse the issue there  Okay  It's all about Bill Burr this week  We want people to go to Bill Burr's show  And then Jimmy will be back  And he'll plug his thing  Then they'll all go to his show  And I'll be out there in front of 30 people  Alone on Thanksgiving  That's how it's going to play out  What you learn in broadcasting school  Is one thought  You give them one thought to digest  You don't want to confuse the listener  You really cock-block any sort of extra tickets 
[03:16:00]  I would have sold out of them  Yeah, because now people are going to  Hey, let's check out Bill  But wait a minute  The guy I like better  Let me see  Jimmy may also be playing  Is right down the street  Right  It's a nicer club  It's in Times Square  He's been on the show longer  He's going to get to  My loyalties towards him  You can't win  Who's this new red-headed asshole  Plenty to do right out the door  When you're done with the comedy show  Let's see  I could be in Times Square in New York 
[03:16:30]  Or I could be in Montclair, New Jersey  Somewhere in Jersey  Hmm  Thank you, Lazlo  There's the one  I think the election's over  You've got to still  Really fast  There was a great instant feedback  That came in  We were talking about the Nintendo  And the doggy game  And you said something about  If there's other people  Playing the doggy game  And they're in the area  Something will happen on your screen  Yeah, wirelessly  It'll detect that there's somebody else  With the game  And then your puppies can play  Like your puppy shows up  On the other person's screen  This is why we have the most  Interactive radio show in America  Because we can't  We can't catch everything 
[03:17:00]  No  We missed the obvious on this one  Reverend Riot from Cincinnati  Hey, I've got a scheme involving  Ninten  It's called Nintendogs  Nintendogs  Nintendogs  Simply buy a DS and Nintendogs  And walk around  Until you get a signal  From another unit  Then you bug them  You know they at least have a DS  In the game  And probably if they have that  They aren't broke  Yeah, I can see where  That would be a problem  People do that with Bluetooth too  They have like Bluetooth detectors  And you can see if  Detect if somebody's got a nice 
[03:17:30]  Mobile phone  Yeah  Maybe like Elo  Yeah  And all that electronic  Crunch them over the head  And take all those devices  There you go  Hey, you guys want to hear about  Miss Senior  Senior America  Do you have her rap song?  I don't think we have it  Maybe we can find it somewhere  Old ladies rapping  Old white women rapping  Oh, that's not funny  It's outrageous  There's nothing  It's anti-funny  Because I will shut off  Whatever is on  That is featuring that  Right  Enough  It is so not funny 
[03:18:00]  It's comedy terrorism  Right  And they got that teen kid  That killed the parents  Yeah  That was a good  Way to fuck up your life  This is any  Way to plan it out  Way to think ahead  Think things over  And you think that  By now people would sort of get it  But there was a front page story  They had blogs  Both of them  Yeah  Like see  Could have been the internet  Made them do it  Yeah  It's like every teen  Has a stupid blog 
[03:18:30]  Every kid's got a blog  Bill Burr's got a blog  Everyone goes to  Website  Message boards  On MySpace  Right  Jimmy's got one too  If you go to  Fuck  Yeah, that was great  The 18 year old  Goes to the parents house  Actually, you took the daughter out  She's 14  He's 18  Takes her out  Brings her home  At 6.30 in the morning  At which point  The parents blow up  Call up the kid  And say  Like at 7.30 in the morning 
[03:19:00]  Get over here  We need to talk to you  So he sits down  And has a talk  With the parents  I'm sure that wasn't  Much fun for him  Probably went along the lines  Of you're 18  My daughter's 14  Could you please stop  Fucking her  Yeah  I would think that  Probably covered the entire  Conversation  Stop bringing her home  At 6 in the morning  With a money shot in her hair  Yeah  Not fun to be involved  In those conversations  The father  Talking about his daughter  Who's younger  Conversation  Been there  Had one of those  Little things  Didn't shoot the guy 
[03:19:30]  And what was the  Obvious solution  The obvious solution  Was you know  Fuck you  Here are my intentions  You know  We're very close  You didn't take out  Your rapier  No I didn't do it  None of that  There was some angry guy  Once and he called me  Melissa my fine feathered friend  And I couldn't get past it  Anything else he said to me  I just was like  Why would he say  Fine feathered friend  Isn't that from like  Bugs Bunny  Yeah  My fine feathered friend  And he used it a couple of times  And I was just standing there  Just yelling at me 
[03:20:00]  About like telling other people  That I was going up to the college  To see his daughter  He used to hang out in the bar  My mother tended bar at  So I told my mother  Who was there  I was saying  Look I'm going up to college  To go see this girl Lisa  Right  And then I guess it got around  In the bar  So now  The guys that love  Fucking with this guy  Because his father  Used to drink at this bar  We're coming in going  Hey so Anthony's going up  To see your daughter  At the college  And just got him  So fucking pissed off 
[03:20:30]  That he called a conference  With me  And  You're just  Bragging  And spreading around  If you're going up there  Why does everybody  Have to fucking  Listen my fine feathered friend  If I  And I'll just  I don't have feathers  Why is he saying this  Over and over again  Wow  He's very angry  So something  I'm guessing in the same line  As that  Happened with this 18 year old  But he  Had a little gumption  And decided to shoot mom and dad  As they were escorting him  To the door  I guess the conversation was over  Yeah 
[03:21:00]  They had probably told him  You're not to see the daughter again  Father's escorting him  To the door to leave  He pulls a pistol out  Shoots him in the back of the head  And then takes off  The daughter  Takes off  No  Runs around the house a little  There's a younger sister  And younger brother  Who then like to try to  Barricade themselves in the rooms  Jump out a window  They're trying all kinds of things  Apparently the kid  Wasn't fixed on shooting them  Kind of  They ran out of the house  And then he shot the mother  And then took off with the daughter  Killed the mother too?  Yeah  Killed the mother too  And then took off  In his parents' car 
[03:21:30]  I guess he had driven over in it  So it's chicks loving him now  Right?  He just killed my parents  Did the chick go  No, they said it was a kidnap  They're calling it a kidnapping  But they don't know  They had been seen  Like getting some lunch  At a sandwich place  She had puffy eyes  Like she was crying and stuff  But she wasn't trying  To get away from him  What's the first thing you do  After you kill the parents?  You jump in the car  Do you turn on the radio  And find a cool song?  I mean  You got to  Go three ahead  You got to  Get our mind off of it  Well, I guess that takes care of that 
[03:22:00]  And then  Do that with your hands  And then you  Have it in your head  You're going to live happily ever after  Where?  Thinking about every movie  Where guys were on the run  It worked out for a few people  Yeah  We could do it  Harrison Ford  We're going to make it  Yeah, there you go  Cleared his name  Cleared his name  But, you know  You did see me kill your parents  So I guess  Telling you that someone else did it  Is out of the question  Yeah, what do you do?  You put on a song  Do you go through the drive-thru? 
[03:22:30]  You know you have a few hours  Before anyone knows  You know every song  I just screw up  That was the mamas and the papas  Motherfucker  Can't get her mind off of it  But they weren't that far away  That's what kills me  Because there was just  Like a prison escape recently  And they found the guy  Literally like an hour and a half away  Yeah, drunk on a payphone  Just right  What an idiot  Dude, flee  There are places in America  Nobody will ever find you 
[03:23:00]  People hang out like an hour away  People aren't really thinking  And I think this kid  At 18  He's in lust with a 14 year old  And kills the parents over it  I don't think he's really  Planned this out  I don't know  He had a gun with him  So maybe he did have it in his head  That he had a bright future too  David G. Ludwig  That's like a  Corporation name right there  David G. Ludwig  Here's some from the Connecticut  Blood Wigs  Well, we got some audio  Let's see what this is about  Well, it doesn't appear  That this is something  He may have planned in advance 
[03:23:30]  Okay  Alright  Is this his lawyer?  Nope  It's one of our favorite things on TV  The expert  The expert  The expert  The expert  They have to drag these people out  What makes this guy an expert on this?  I don't know  Well, it doesn't appear  That this is something  He may have planned in advance  Keep in mind  It occurred  In the middle of an argument  About the curfew  Unfortunately  18 year olds  Can be very impulsive  Impatient 
[03:24:00]  And imprudent  And when  A block  Or some sort of barrier  To getting what they want  A girlfriend  Is in their way  They often times do act  In an aggressive way  Aggressive  My guess  That's bullshit  Or these stories  Would be on TV every day  He's really  Kind of toning the whole thing down  This guy is really  Just kind of  Glazing it over a little bit  In a happy little way  Yeah, you know  He wants something  They whine about it a little  There's a block  There's some kind of  Yeah  Him describing a gang rape  Well, you know 
[03:24:30]  There was a group of gentlemen  A little frustrated maybe  A young lady  Was involved  You know  When anxiety gets in the air  And things are pent up  People tend to take  Aggressive actions  Towards another member  Of society  Things can get passionate  In that atmosphere  There's a group mentality  Sure  Yeah  Members come out  And they're blasted  In her anal area  My guess 
[03:25:00]  Is the alleged killer here  Mr. Lovewick  Didn't plan this in advance  But it was something  That occurred  In the heat of the moment  I also doubt  That there's anything  About his background  That would have tipped off  The Bordens  Or anybody else  To the potential  For committing homicide  So you're saying  So you're saying  That there was  Nothing in their relationship  Or in their friendship  At that point  That would have made  Carabeth's parents say  Yes, you stupid bitch  Maybe our daughter  Should spend less time  With them  Even though we knew  That we know now  That they were not 
[03:25:30]  Allowed to see one another  Right  Well, the age difference  Is what they were  Concerned about  But according to reports  There was nothing about  This boy in particular  That  I thought you were  Going to say  According to reports  You didn't look 14  Yeah  I love you Mickey  Yeah  That has a little  Of that going on, right?  The thing about  This boy in particular  That sent off warning signs  That he was dangerous  Essentially  They forbid her to see him  They went out  On the sly  She came home late  Violating a curfew  And an argument ensued 
[03:26:00]  Unfortunately  He was armed with a gun  Unfortunately  That seems to be  A big part of the problem here  Had he not been armed  With a gun  This episode  Would have turned out  Very differently  If he had a rapier  Right  I'll run ye through  Romeo and Juliet  Yeah  Well, now the expert  Talks about the issue  Of age difference  Robin, I want to talk to you  Because he brought up  The age difference  And that's one of those things  That I remember  When I was growing up  My parents said  Hey, there's a big  Age difference  Between early teens 
[03:26:30]  And late teens  A little more  She's 18  She's 14  How critical is that?  Well, I think what happens  Is the younger  The girl is  And the bigger  The age difference  The more there's  The potential for risk  Obviously as you get older  It's different  The big problem is  You want different things  Out of a relationship  You have different experiences  But parents really have to  Focus on the individuals  Themselves  And get to know  Who that person is  And why actually  Your daughter  Or your son  Is either  Your son is dating down  And your daughter  Is dating up  Yes  She wants a Barbie's playhouse 
[03:27:00]  You want hairless muff  It's easy  They do want different things  He's 18  He's old enough  To own a gun  And a car  Yeah  I think if he had  His parents  A car  And a gun  Who knows  Who knows  Where that came from  And that expert guy  Said oh you know  This wasn't premeditated  What do you think  Was he going to the range  After that?  I know  He went over  With a gun  That leads me to believe  He was probably  Anticipating a problem  Some type of problem  That you need a gun for 
[03:27:30]  It's not like you know  There are different levels  You don't just go  I might have a problem  By getting into an argument  With this guy  I should maybe  Think it out  Bring a good argument  With me  No  Not a gun  It was the sex switch  In his head  He made every wrong decision  And then okay  The guy says  I can't see it  Do I take the gun out  And just wave it at him  And threaten him  Nah  I'm going to shoot him  In the back of the  The head  Do I stop there?  Nah  Got to get mom too  Yeah  Going to shoot her  In the head too  That way I'll never  Get out of prison  What if you say  Because I can hear 
[03:28:00]  The argument in my head  But I'm more mature  Than the boy's my age  And he understands me  And what about that?  You know that's great  Because you want to  Communicate with your child  Because sometimes  It's a nice kind of kid  And teens at that age  Want to become independent  They want to have  New relationships  It's when it turns bad  Quote unquote  When that boy  And 85% of violent  Kind of abusive relationships  Are when it's a girl  Not a boy  And you know what happens  Is the boy is controlling  Your daughter is being isolated  She's changing her friends 
[03:28:30]  Those are all signs  That it's a bad relationship  Regardless of the age  And when he's older  He may have more power  Isolation  What else did you say  Isolation  She's giving up  Some of her old friends  She's being controlled  She's changing how she dresses  She's being secretive  She's wearing a dog collar  Her parents had said  We don't want you  To see this boy  Was that a good approach?  You know disapproving  Obviously not  I'm forbidding  Because once you forbid  It starts to push it underground  And all communication is gone 
[03:29:00]  You really need to talk  To your child  About who she is  What she's looking for  Maybe negotiate  New kinds of rules  Maybe it's a sign  There's something about  The parenting relationship  That needs to be changed  Or is your child  Having some hard times  With friends  Peers  And is needing approval  And some kind of validation  Outside of the home  There's just a whole crew  Of these people  That go from  Channel to channel  Oh I know  So called experts  Tragedy to tragedy  That can turn  Like ten minutes 
[03:29:30]  Of just nonsense babble  Yeah  That's what that was  You gotta leave  The communication lines  Open  With the people  You think the father  Right before he hit the floor  With that bullet in his head  That last moment of life  And consciousness  There was kind of  An I told you so  Thing going on  Like I  See  I told you this kid  Was a fucking scumbag  Like almost vindication  Like he was almost like  See  Look  There you go  I told you this kid 
[03:30:00]  Was a scumbag  And he killed me  Here's your love of your life  There he is  Go ahead  Run off with him  Like that split second  Before all functions  Just shut down  Stupid kid  Father knows best  You idiot  Just let me bleed  To death here  Alright really fast  We gotta find out  What this nasal sex spray  Thing is all about  Nasal  Sex spray  It's all the rage  Today  All the rage  Yeah it's a new thing  That just came out  Most of the people  Don't snore  Let's find out 
[03:30:30]  Well you know  It's beyond  Viagra  Viagra and related drugs  Work on shall we say  The peripheral appendages  Of  Sex  Engendering blood flow  That's right  This works right on  The arousal center  In the brain  And so this stimulates  Not only  The physical capacity  For passion  But the interest in it  And it appears to have  This effect  In early studies  In both men and women  Now we know a lot more  About what it does  To rats than people  So far  But early studies  Particularly in men 
[03:31:00]  To a lesser extent  In women  Show  Increased passion  Increased interest in sex  And then heightened  Physical sensation  So that's quickly  Within 15 minutes  Apparently  Apparently  Because it's still in testing  Yes  Apparently  Apparently  Apparently the rat's cock  Was going up  In 15 seconds  At this point  So what  You just spray this  And instantly  You're interested in sex  We call it  A Peruvian flake  It's a brand new  Scientific discovery  Can you imagine  What it smells like  For it to make you  Interested in sex 
[03:31:30]  Within 15 minutes  Something that you  Shoot up your nose  That makes you  Want to fuck  Great  Pussy mist  Well that's where  I was going  My Faberge  Smells like a  Brand new yo-yo  Nice  Intestine  That's right  As you mentioned  Phase 3 trials  In men  Are just beginning  It's possible  If everything goes well  This could be a drug  We would see  By the end of 2006  For men  Probably not 
[03:32:00]  For another year  Or two after that  For women  If we don't run  Into sex  Now this is  It's a hormone  Essentially  PT1  Stop  I don't want to  Give me that cock  It's a hormone  Essentially  PT141  It stimulates the brain  We have to worry  That there's a possibility  Of side effects  That sex in a nasal spray  May not be  A panacea  It's like  You always hear  In Asia  They're like  Snorting rhinoceros  Horns 
[03:32:30]  How do you have  A problem  Getting horny  Yeah  Why don't you just say  Just admit  You're not attracted  To your wife anymore  Yeah  Right  The poor rhinoceros  Has to suffer  Because one ass  Thought it helped him  You need PT141  Right  Chewing on a monkey's foot  Just a second  Just a second sweetheart  I'm starting to feel something  You're sitting there  In a Victoria's Secret  Feeling like a fucking idiot  You're chewing on a monkey's foot  Yeah maybe the passion's 
[03:33:00]  Just gone  Yeah  A new  All right well  There's possible downsides  To the drug  No  There's side effects  Something you snort  You're kidding  But you know David  Just as sure as God made little green apples  People are going to talk about this as  I guess as an aphrodisiac  Right  Well and in essence  That's exactly what it is  Except so far it appears to really work  As opposed to  Rhinoceros horn  And penis of tiger 
[03:33:30]  That's all they said it was  Maybe this will benefit endangered species  Because we'll stop  Cutting those things off  Of those animals  Which is where they ought to stay  They don't work  This apparently does  There are worries here though Charlie  And I think we ought to voice those  I worry about people using this  As a band-aid  For a damaged relationship  You know this is not  Relationship improvement  In the nasal spray  And if you're not having  A satisfying intimate life  Because of problems  In the relationship  I would hate to see people  Fix it this way  I also worry about it  Being a potentially corrupting influence  Could this be the next 
[03:34:00]  Date rape commodity  Particularly combined with alcohol  Which disinhibits  This enhances desire  People could wake up the next morning  Thinking my goodness  What have I done  Well they are talking about it  At least many years  From the market  And in trials  We'll have to wait and see  But certainly very intriguing  Very intriguing  All you've got to do  Is just pretend you sneezed  In her direction  And she's good to go  I think a band-aid  For a failed relationship  Is called a mistress  I can't wait  Like the pharmaceutical companies  Are going to come out  With something like  Called a  Vaginax  Smells like your wife's vagina 
[03:34:30]  Just spray it on  That's great  Yeah  I'm glad they  Yeah but I used your scent  It's not  It's not that bad  I'm glad they've cured everything  Yeah you are  To where they can work on this  Some pharmaceutical companies  Very proud of them  What were they actually  Trying  Chasing your wife  Around the kitchen  With a spray  Because she's rigid  Come here you bitch  Smell this  Snort this  Yeah throw it in our hairspray  Throw it in  Yeah  You know  Use chloroform  Let's spin around for a while

Oh sure  Microphone friend  In front of me  Expert  Oh I forgot  I forgot  We came up with that a while ago 
[03:40:30]  I read this one a while ago  There was a vending machine company  In Japan  That was selling  Women's used panties  And they come in a little  Plastic cylinder  And you'd  Use the vending machine  Pay money  And pull this out  And then sniff it  Do it  Have a jerk off in it  Whatever you want to do with it  That's how it is  But yet  You cannot show women's pubic hair  In the porno  For some reason  Yeah any Jap porn you see  Is like edited out

Hairless people anyway  How odd are they?  They're really wacky  About the pubic hair  And supposedly  Like women  Shaving there  Is not popular  Like it is here  They like to be  As bushy as possible  It supposedly shows  Fertility or  Very strange  Maturity  I don't know  And there was a guy  That we spoke to  That actually talked about  A procedure  Of transplanting 
[03:41:30]  Oh that's right  Curly hair  From men  Into the area  Of Asian men's  Pubic areas  To give them  A curlier  Hairier area  Or was it to  Or was it to make  Their chest hairier  And they were using  Pubic hair  Were they doing that  Reruns of Magnum P.I.
