<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  He recapped the previous week, highlighting Jim Norton's surprisingly positive interaction with Scott Shannon while promoting his stand-up, and Bill Burr's phone call detailing humorous travel experiences in Germany, including visits to Hitler's bunkers and observations on cultural differences between America and Europe.  The pre-show previewed the upcoming main show, announcing Burt Kreischer as a studio guest, and included clips from Lindsay Lohan's reality show and a news story about antisemitic messages in Easter eggs.  A caller criticized the show's "rude and crude" commentary on zombie Jesus.  Sam also recounted contentious calls from recurring callers Marion and Lady Di, a heated exchange between Opie and Marion, and Mars' admission to having herpes.  Sam promoted his podcast and teased upcoming segments.

The main show opened with the hosts and Sam Roberts recounting a dinner celebrating a Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield movie.  They detailed their attempts to get photos with the boxers, focusing on Jim Norton's aggressive pursuit of a photo with Holyfield (resulting in a picture of a smiling Norton and a scowling Holyfield) and his subsequent overly enthusiastic behavior.  They eventually got photos with both Tyson (who lightly punched Norton in the gut after a compliment on his book) and Holyfield. The dinner, described as cramped, included Ice-T and Coco, with an awkward encounter involving Norton's long fingernails and Ice-T.  The conversation then shifted to the Boston Marathon, discussing the disproportionate number of Kenyan and Ethiopian winners, and speculating on genetic, environmental, and cultural factors.  Several callers offered their theories.  A caller also claimed to be Jim Norton's father.  The segment featured frequent use of profanity and homophobic slurs.

The show continued with a discussion about white men's difficulty in winning major marathons compared to Kenyan runners' success.  The hosts speculated on reasons, including genetics and training methods.  A caller, Steve, argued that an athlete like LeBron James could excel at marathons, leading to a debate about body types and athletic aptitudes.  A caller corrected them about Muggsy Bogues' failed attempt at the New York City Marathon. The discussion moved to boxing, the movie *Champions*, and socioeconomic factors influencing athletes' choices.  Callers contributed to discussions about the disproportionate number of African-American athletes in certain sports, the athletic abilities of animals versus humans, dolphin intelligence, the teaching of evolution, and the age of the Earth.  The segment included commercial breaks and promotional announcements, rambling conversations, comedic banter, and offensive language.  The show also touched upon increased Boston Marathon security following the bombing and a man surviving a plane wheel well stowaway incident.

The next segment began with Opie recounting a humorous misunderstanding about a movie and a tree falling on his house, followed by a discussion of a phone prank.  A news story about an "Ice Road Trucker" charged with kidnapping and assaulting a prostitute was discussed at length.  The hosts then discussed how different cities respond to disasters (Boston, New Jersey, New Orleans, and a highly critical discussion of Detroit), and the lack of media outrage regarding gun violence in Chicago. A Toronto caller contributed to the Detroit discussion.  A significant portion focused on Lindsay Lohan's failing reality show and her perceived dishonesty and addiction, with several callers weighing in.  The hosts discussed a Canadian radio show ("Humble and Fred") that criticized their show, comparing radio humor and stand-up comedy.  The segment concluded with more commentary on Humble and Fred, online comments, and the short appearance of Bert Kreischer, who was a guest in the studio.

A segment focused on a Duke University campaign urging people to stop using offensive words and phrases ("no homo," "tranny," "that's so gay," "bitch," etc.).  The hosts and Bert Kreischer (in studio) debated the campaign's legitimacy, the offensiveness of various words ("retard," "N-word," "F-word"), and context.  Kreischer shared an anecdote about removing offensive language from his act. A caller, Brian from Chicago, shared his experience of being called a "faggot."  The conversation explored the potential harm of these words, censorship, and the origins of slurs.  Kreischer promoted his book and Travel Channel show, recounting some harrowing adventures.

The show featured Ziggy Marley promoting his album *Fly Rasta* and a concert.  Numerous commercials aired (Dave Smith dealerships, Two Men and a Truck, getaroom.com, Zoom e-cigs, etc.).  The post-show discussion centered on a "fuck-up list," Sal and Iroch's contributions, and their disagreements.  They discussed the possibility of positive life changes and whether they would be ridiculed. Other topics included listener calls, Lindsay Lohan's show, a debate on genetics and eugenics, and Jim's reaction to the photo with Evander Holyfield.  The show ended with clips of the day, further "fuck-up list" discussion, bickering,  a "line of the day" referencing a gay Archie comic character, E-Rock's gift to Scott Shannon, a caller calling Iraq "boring as a rake", more commercial breaks, and banter.

Prepare for the incomparable O.P. and H.M. show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  It was good.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony pre-show. 
[00:01:00]  With Sam Roberts.  With Sam Roberts.  Welcome to the pre-show.  866-WOW-ON-WOW is the phone number to call.  That's 866-969-1969.  After a day of rest.  We are live here on the O.P. and Anthony pre-show.  O.P. and Anthony will be live in a few minutes.  Minutes from now, O.P. and Anthony will take the airwaves once again and start another week of radio on a Tuesday. 
[00:01:30]  It's a Monday on a Tuesday, folks.  Then you'll like that one, I hope.  A lot to get into today.  So if you want to call in, call now before the phone lines get all jammed up and talk about everything that happened last week on the show.  Also, if you finally got a chance to hear the big O.P. and Anthony unmasked over the weekend that was playing here on the O.P. and Anthony channel and on Raw Dog, it's also finally available on demand to my knowledge.  So a lot of people got to hear that for the first time over the weekend. 
[00:02:00]  Or if you'd like to talk about what may be going on today on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Because if you were following along with the guys' Twitters, you know that they all had full weekends.  So a lot to do today.  A lot to do indeed.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number to call.  And I want to start with something that happened on Friday's show.  To me, it was probably – and Friday was a big show.  And Friday was a dangerous show for the staff because Friday was a tired show. 
[00:02:30]  After we went to dinner after the unmasked on Thursday.  So everybody was tired on Friday, which means O.P. and Anthony are cranky, which means for the staff, everybody's got to be on their toes.  But me included.  The most surprising thing about Friday's show was when Jim left the studio.  And I know that we've all established that Scott Shannon now has a positive relationship with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I don't know exactly how it happened. 
[00:03:00]  After all the years that we made fun of the Scott and Todd show here on ONA, we finally actually have a positive relationship where Scott is a friend of the show.  So much show, so, so, so much show, show enough that Jim left ONA for a few minutes to call in to Scott Shannon's new CBS FM morning show to promote his upcoming dates at Caroline's.  But it was amazing, not only to hear Jim on Scott Shannon's show, but to hear them get along like old friends. 
[00:03:30]  Listen to this clip from Friday.  I worked with that group for a couple of years.  And all my friends are, you've got to write a book, you've got to write a book, you've got to write.  Some of the stuff is actually unbelievable.  What did you do with them?  I was like a publicity manager.  I was hired by Casablanca to take them on the road and introduce them to radio stations because I was already in radio and I got fired from a job again. 
[00:04:00]  And so this guy hired me to say, hey, I want you to take Kiss around the top 40 radio stations and introduce them.  And they used to have to get their makeup like twice a day.  And I'd take them to, you know, the station in D.C. and we'd do a promotion and all that kind of thing.  Basically, I babysitted Ace.  Oh, he was kind of the one even back then that was kind of more likely to do something and vomit during an interview or do something.  That's him. 
[00:04:30]  Nice fella, but blue nun wine 24-7.  Were you surprised that Gene and Paul kind of had nothing to do with them?  I mean, I was like, come on, why don't they at least be friendly for the haul?  But it seems like Paul is the one really pushing this.  Like, he really seems to hate those guys.  Well, they let him down frequently, let's put it that way.  Did you read Peter's book where he said at one point, let's just say a girl was doing something and then Ace crawled under the covers with her?  Two of them under the covers with Peter?  Did you read that?  Yeah, I read that.  I was there, my friend. 
[00:05:00]  Not there that particular night.  Jim, I wasn't there that night.  I was about to love you forever if you got under the covers.  That would have made me so happy.  I didn't do that.  I didn't do that.  I also love Jim's priority on his career where he just stops.  He's there to promote his gig.  But as soon as the conversation of Kiss comes up, he stopped the presses.  You know Kiss?  Let's talk about that.  I mean, I guess it makes sense for Scott's show because now he's on the Classic Rock channel.  But it is funny. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, I'm not criticizing.  I would do the same thing if professional wrestling came up.  Well, as Jim Norton phone called in to Scott Shannon's show, we had a surprise phoner on the Opie and Anthony show on Friday.  Bill Burr called in.  And Bill Burr, I mean, it's always awesome to hear Bill.  We haven't heard from Bill in a while because he lives in L.A.  So he calls in when he gets a chance, and he always has a story about traveling. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know of many comics that are as well-traveled as Bill Burr, and I think it's because, unlike most comics, Bill decided at some point in his career that when he traveled from city to city to actually walk around.  Most comics, when they're on the road, just know what the inside of hotel rooms look like and all these cities they go to.  But Bill Burr started doing this thing where he was going to a baseball game in every stadium.  He was really getting a feel for the local flavor of wherever it was that he went. 
[00:06:30]  And then he started extending that, and then he started going to other countries.  And now he called into the show after, I guess, a European vacation.  And he called in and started talking about Germany.  Let's go to track 11.  In one of the bunkers we walked into, right as you walked into, right in the entrance,  was this little carved out, maybe like an inch or two below the floor area to stand, and it was a shower. 
[00:07:00]  And I guess Hitler, I didn't know, he had gotten gassed in World War I.  So he made sure all of those little pillbox things, or whatever the hell you call them, had little showers in them.  Oh, so if they throw gas in there, you could fucking, like, rinse off?  Well, if you got gassed off, you could get gas wherever, out in the field or something.  You could run in or wherever the hell it happened.  Oh, and on my podcast, Kyle, that was, like, the first, like, the softer side of Hitler. 
[00:07:30]  That's funny.  Wow, that sounds intense.  Blue-eyed troops to get gassed.  Yeah, they need to be able to watch off.  They have a lot of that stuff just laying around still?  Well, I mean, it's not, like, laying around, it's, like, built in.  I mean, it's, like, the way the Germans built their shit was, this is the funny thing about the tour.  After hearing about their technology, I think the next car I'm going to buy is going to be German engineers.  Yeah, no shit, right?  How'd they lose that war?  The reason why we beat them, we didn't really outsmart them. 
[00:08:00]  We just kind of out-manufactured them.  Just kept fighting them until they ran out of shit.  Oh, my God.  Dude, their machine guns, this guy was saying, were better, so much superior to ours, that when we would kill one, we'd drop our gun and pick up theirs.  Their tanks were better, and then, like, the bunkers that they made, we even shot, like, bazookas and shit at them.  I mean, they just sort of, I mean, they did some damage, but people inside of them were all right.  So, yeah, they definitely, uh... 
[00:08:30]  Just the fact that they're still there is amazing, yeah.  Yeah.  From the makers of Mercedes-Benz comes a pillbox.  Burr's awesome.  He went on, and we were also, if you haven't heard it, go on YouTube.  We've played it twice now in the last week or two, but Bill Burr's Sherry's Berries Live Read.  I know it's been on YouTube forever, but we finally caught on to it.  You can find that on our Twitter, actually, at O&A Show, if you haven't heard it yet.  He went on to talk about Americans in France, as Bill Burr continued. 
[00:09:00]  One of the number one ways that they make money in France is tourism.  It's the number one, I guess, visited country on the planet.  Wow.  And they did have a bad reputation of being snotty.  Oh, yeah.  They had a horrible one.  But, dude, I've got to tell you, though, like, you know, it's...  I don't even know that it's 50-50.  Because the one thing I have noticed since traveling is coming back is, you know, we're fucking loud. 
[00:09:30]  I can't tell you, dude, and I hate admitting that because I always hated people going over to Europe, and I'm not kissing their ass.  Like, one of my favorite things to do when I go over there and do stand-up is start to lead them on like I'm going to trash America,  and then I start bringing up all the fucking horrible shit that they did.  But, dude, we're just loud, dude.  We're cowboys.  Loud Americans.  Right, right.  Cowboys.  And I sit there and I laugh. 
[00:10:00]  Me and me laugh when we're over there because you can spot us a mile away.  I'm not saying we're dumber than they are.  We're just loud.  Yeah, yeah.  God, and it's...  We make our presence known.  Oh, Billy, Billy.  If you want to get on the air with us, if you're on the phone now, stay on hold.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  I'll get to all of you in a moment. 
[00:10:30]  Also, we'll get to some of the clips of the staff on Friday's show.  Taking it on the chin, if you will.  And everything that's going to be going on today.  It's going to be a busy show.  We have Burt Kreischer coming in studio.  Burt Kreischer hasn't been in in a very long time.  You may know him from the Travel Channel show Trip Flip from his classic machine story on Joe Rogan.  He's one of the funniest guys I know.  He's always, always got a story.  He's got a book eventually coming out.  But I think this appearance is to promote Trip Flip on the Travel Channel. 
[00:11:00]  So, Burt Kreischer will be in the studio later on this morning.  We've got some clips from Lindsay Lohan's finale of her reality show, which was, I mean, absurd to say the least.  And, of course, we'll get into everything Opie and Anthony and Jim were tweeting about what was going on.  We'll talk about that in a few minutes here on the pre-show.  And I'll get to your phone calls.  So, stay on hold.  But before we do that, one more clip from Mr. Bill Burr on Friday's show. 
[00:11:30]  I actually learned about money over there because I was saying to me, I go, you know what?  We're over here blowing money.  To actually own a yacht, like, there's no point in, during your day, you not have money coming in.  These guys are making money.  Yeah, right.  They're sitting here, like, they, I don't know what they do.  I don't know who they're oppressing or what's going on, but you've got to have that making money while you're sleeping.  Right, right.  They're not balancing their checkbooks. 
[00:12:00]  If you own a yacht.  Wondering where that yacht payment is coming from this month.  Trying to figure out if you can dig up enough, you know, dollars for the fuel.  Yeah, that you just know you have enough money.  It's just coming in from all directions.  I forgot about that.  But, yeah, if you have a fucking yacht, you just, that's hemorrhaging money.  And we took the tour on the boat ride, and the guy's pointing out houses.  And there was, like, somebody there was, like, from the Middle East, the big oil guy.  There was somebody else that was part of this conglomerate that owns, like, Louis Vuitton, all that top-end, next-top model. 
[00:12:30]  Like, five of the top lines of that high-end shit, I guess, is all owned by the same person.  So, this person had the house there.  I looked over, and there was all these zillion-dollar houses in the middle of one of them.  Actually, he took a picture.  It was this giant house, and there was this flagpole, and on top of it was a German flag.  So, I was trying to think.  I was, like, maybe that's the McLaren guy or something.  Like, it was, like, they were, like, celebrity, but, like, businessmen. 
[00:13:00]  Right, right.  They're so rich that they enter that celebrity status.  Yeah, like, if you owned the Gap, you'd be a bum over there.  And we think we're wealthy.  It's amazing.  But Bill Burr, hopefully, I mean, it's always a trick, because we don't know when he's calling in.  It's just, if he happens to be awake, if he's jet-lagged, or if he's stuck in an airport, or wherever he is, Bill Burr calls in, and it's always awesome.  We also have a news story that we're going to get to today. 
[00:13:30]  I want to know what Ant's take on it is, because there's a neighborhood where the families were all doing Easter egg hunts, right?  So, they put out Easter eggs on their front lawns so their kids could go find them.  And this white supremacist group was going from front lawn to front lawn and just kind of throwing one of their eggs onto the lawn.  And the kids would find this one egg, and they'd open it up, and there was just a note inside that said something to the effect of, like, diversity is the elimination of white, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:14:00]  I was like, what are you doing?  Just let it be Easter for these children.  Let's go to James.  James in North Carolina, welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Hi, uh, hello.  Hello.  I just called in to say that I heard the replay of the Monday show where Anthony and Opie were talking about zombie Jesus.  That's right.  And they got really rude and crude about it. 
[00:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  And you're losing another listener, and I suspect that there's going to be more if that thing keeps airing.  Are you being serious?  Oh, yeah, I'm very serious.  Well, listen, I mean, you're saying you're not going to listen to Opie and Anthony anymore because they were being rude and crude about zombie Jesus.  Do you not get offended when they're rude and crude about every other subject?  Like, are we just not allowed to offend you?  We can offend everybody else? 
[00:15:00]  You can say whatever you want, but after you said that, I'm not going to listen anymore.  Well, let me ask you something.  Did Jesus come back from the dead?  Of course he did.  That sounds like a zombie to me, does it not?  Isn't that exactly what a zombie is?  Well, you know, you can try to make humor out of it now.  Have you seen the walking down?  I'm telling you, Jesus would not have been the second coming if somebody had pierced his brain.  That's all I'm saying.  Nobody thought to do that.  Before he ascended and became our savior, nobody thought to pierce his brain and stop zombie Jesus. 
[00:15:30]  That's all.  Well, I'm just trying to let you know that there's going to be more if that thing gets around.  And they should care.  They told the other Christian listener that they didn't care if he called or listened or whatever.  Well, I am glad that Opie and Anthony's irresponsible broadcasting has not affected the listenership of the pre-show.  So, as long as you will continue to listen to the pre-show, I don't have a major problem with it. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Look, I'm serious.  What type of...  Who knows?  Jason in Rochester.  Good morning, Sam.  Good to hear you.  Good to hear you.  Look, listen to that phone.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I recently was looking at Bobo's Twitter yesterday.  It was fucking hilarious because not only did they tweet Colin Quinn and say,  Hey, buddy, you should write self-help books with all those funny tweets of advice you give. 
[00:16:30]  But then afterwards, he starts inviting people to his birthday celebration at a bar next to Citi Field.  And then he says, Please contact me if I follow you or have your number.  And after that, he says, Also, please do not retweet my last two tweets.  Because they were personal invites.  Yeah.  I guess people that follow him.  I don't know.  I had Bobo in a panic this weekend because he tweeted something to me.  He said, Hey, Sam, some fan told me to tell you to get a haircut. 
[00:17:00]  So, I just quoted his tweet and wrote blocked under it.  But I didn't actually do anything.  And then he just started tweeting me and panicking.  He was blocked.  That's awesome.  Keep up the good work, buddy.  Can I shamelessly plug something?  Please do.  I just started writing for the Interobank.  It's the podcast section.  All right.  I just wanted to put that out there.  We did your mom's house.  And I think soon is going to be Bob Kelly.  Well, check out the Interobank.  Thank you, Jason.  Well, thank you.  And let's go to Lou in Jersey. 
[00:17:30]  What's up, Lou?  Sammy, good morning.  Good morning, buddy.  Yeah.  What a great week of radio last week.  But derailed in the last second by Marion's incessant calling again.  I've got to figure it out.  She has, throughout this whole time, she's basically talked about four things out of all the calls.  She talks about her fucking cruises, how she exercises, she insults Lady Di, and then she also has her parrot insults, as ants like to say. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  That's what she does.  She just repeats what the guys say about her back to the guys.  It was really absurd.  She called in at the end of Friday's show, and it was kind of one of those things where Lou was right.  It was just a terrible way to end the week of radio.  But we started with Lady Di.  And we were kind of trying to ask her about Crown Chicken, the place where she got mugged.  But she immediately changed the subject to something that was not interesting. 
[00:18:30]  Or at least it could have been interesting, but she didn't let it be interesting.  Let's go to track 15.  Hey, there's a rumor going around that the chicken place where you were mugged at closed down years ago.  Oh, no.  No, it didn't.  It's still open.  That's why this is a rumor at this point.  But supposedly someone checked it out on Google Map or something, and it was closed down.  No, it's still there.  But, you know, I'm avoiding that place right now.  Oh, yeah.  Why? 
[00:19:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  I went to the hospital.  I went to the hospital.  Who cares?  Well, Bill had to go to the hospital.  That's how back he was.  What a terrible existence that is going on in this hovel.  Oh, I thought you meant on this radio show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why do we care that Bill went to the hospital?  The bed bug.  The virus, the fucking drunks, the fucking lying, the muggings, the no job, the fucking... 
[00:19:30]  It's just...  Getting naked in front of Ugly Betty, puking in the sticks.  The vomiting, the shitting, the fucking squirting, the bleeding.  You're just a god-fucking disaster.  A god-fucking disaster is right.  Can you imagine, if this is the way Lady Di conducts herself, on the phone when she's on the air with Opie and Anthony, can you imagine what the conversations are like between Lady Di and Marion, like, privately on the phone? 
[00:20:00]  There must be zero train of thought.  Like, they both just say things.  Like, Marion would say, you know, Di, what you need to do is...  And then Di just goes, Bill was in the hospital.  And then Marion goes, I like apples.  And then Di goes, breakfast!  And they just go back and forth.  Just with no sort of consistency to any type of conversation.  Let's go to Bob in Illinois.  What's up, Bob?  Yeah, you better watch out.  Sam, you got the Jesus mafia after you. 
[00:20:30]  Why?  Because of that six-year-old zombie Jesus clip.  And then Anthony, the other day, says, God's fucking disaster.  You better fucking watch it.  I hope everybody knows.  I said that zombie Jesus was the savior, for the record.  So I hope they're not after me, too.  Jim in Ohio.  Yeah, along the same note there.  I heard the replay about the zombie thing.  And, yeah, I'm going to keep listening. 
[00:21:00]  But I'm not going to listen to that first caller and his bullshit.  All right, so we gained a listener.  All right, so we're evening out the odds here.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're doing just fine on the Opie and Anthony show.  Terrific.  Marion, as if the Lady Di thing wasn't bad enough,  Marion called the show at the end of the show on Friday.  And just started – I mean, Lady Di – Lady Di had a weird tweet, too.  We were talking about tweets.  I just got a tweet from Lady Di that said,  I love you, Sam, over the weekend. 
[00:21:30]  And I didn't know she felt so strongly.  It creeped me out a little bit.  But I did share that one with everybody, too.  A lot of people got a kick out of it.  But she's got a lot of love in her heart.  Lady Di has no ill will toward not being invited to the unmasked.  Marion still did.  Marion on Friday still had a lot of ill will  and started talking like a tough guy.  So Opie decided to come back at her just as strong. 
[00:22:00]  But we did have the table, the VIP, the bucket of champagne, the wings,  and a free tab on the O&A show.  Yeah, it was all free.  I didn't know you were not going to do that.  Yes, they were.  Because you never called – that's why I called you and hung up on you.  What are you saying, tough guy?  Look out.  It's Marion.  Ooh.  Yeah, you big bruiser.  Scared of her.  You big bruiser.  Look out.  You know where we are.  Come down here right now.  We're going to scrap.  She could handle herself. 
[00:22:30]  Don't worry about me.  Oh, right.  That fucking tough guy act.  Shut it.  Shut up.  I want to work.  Well, the invite was there.  The invite was there.  That fat ass in your mom jeans.  Shut it.  Not my mom jeans.  You're maybe your mom jeans.  Oh.  Watch out for the tough guy.  Get out.  Tough guy with her fucking minor bird comebacks. 
[00:23:00]  That's great.  You parrot comebacks.  Mark, maybe you're mom jeans.  Mark, maybe you're hair.  Mark, maybe you're pants.  Shut up.  Get out, man.  Hold on a second, man.  There goes tough guy.  What happened, tough guy?  You got to punch out?  Tough guy.  You fucking mutant.  You cartoon character.  Get me on the phone.  Get me on the phone again.  Shut up.  We don't...  You too.  What?  Was Bob Weeby there?  Yes, everyone was there. 
[00:23:30]  Everybody.  Just keep saying names.  Just keep naming everyone from the show.  Was Dillinger there?  Right.  Was Malcolm X there?  You were the only one...  Was Pete Holmes there?  We had a table.  The only one that wasn't there.  We had a table set aside for you, so I don't know why you didn't show up.  Diane should have gave you the message.  She was told.  Maybe that's the problem.  Marion absolutely knew there was a table for you with VIP treatment.  She fucked up.  But she was too busy being a tough guy.  Look out.  She had a bar brawl to settle. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Right.  She didn't tell you because she couldn't get to her phone because her dukes were up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was knocking somebody's...  She's putting a battery on her shoulder and daring someone to knock it off.  Right.  It was a car battery, that pig.  And it just went on and on.  Lady Di would not hang up the phone on Friday.  She just kept going.  And I won't put you through all that, I don't think.  We have a lot of show to get to today.  As I said, Burt Kreischer is going to be in studio. 
[00:24:30]  A couple different Easter clips.  There's the white supremacist one.  There was also a news clip of some newscasters, and they got nervous because they thought it  would be funny to have rabbits on their news desk.  And they just started humping each other.  The rabbits just started...  They're animals.  And they're rabbits.  You know how, like they say, teenagers have sex like rabbits?  The rabbits started having sex like rabbits in the middle of the news broadcast.  So it's always fun to see newscasters panic.  And all the other...  There's a Jimmy Fallon video, of course, going everywhere. 
[00:25:00]  I was going to talk about all of the tweets that were going out.  What was going on with Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Because there's a couple things.  We've got to hear how their Easter weekend...  With Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.  And if you guys were following along Opie Radio and Jim Norton on Twitter, you know that  both those guys were at the screening.  They went to the dinner afterwards.  Photos with Evander.  Photos with Tyson.  Photos with Sam Roberts. 
[00:25:30]  I was there.  So that's why I know it was a notable event.  Anthony will get into all that today on the show.  I don't know.  We have clips.  I wish I had time to get to all of them.  Because as I said, Friday's show was a rough day for the staff.  And I have clips.  I have one of the guys commenting on Sal's mom.  I have Denny and me fighting.  And I have Mars admitting to having herpes.  And I don't know where to go.  I think we only have time for one. 
[00:26:00]  Let me go to Brody in Dallas.  Maybe Brody will make the call.  What's up, Brody?  Hey, man.  Good to hear you, Sam.  You too.  I just wanted to say I'm a huge SRSOLA fan and promoter.  And I love the return of Amy to Kitchen Nightmares.  Yes.  As far as what clip to go to, I don't know.  I mean, they're all good.  Will you tell me?  Here's what I have.  I have Denny and me fighting over my intro at the Unmasked. 
[00:26:30]  I have Kenny commenting on Sal's mom.  And I have Mars admitting that he has herpes.  I mean, we need to hear about Mars.  Because Kenny doesn't know what he's talking about.  And Denny is just inappropriate.  He doesn't need to be disrespecting your talent.  You're right.  Both Denny and Kenny have no place here, do they, Sal?  Absolutely not.  Sal, don't be afraid to be offended by what Kenny said to you.  Thank you, Brody.  And for those of you that don't know what Brody was talking about,  he was talking about my podcast that I do on the Internet. 
[00:27:00]  Let's go to Mars.  And this is, I love, I love this clip.  I'm glad Brody picked this clip.  Mainly because it's not humiliating for me.  And because Mars' honesty, it's almost childish.  And it entertains me to no end.  I think it's great on the radio.  I love whenever Mars is in studio.  Listen to just how directly he answers these questions.  Let's go to the track.  That's track, what, six?  Yes. 
[00:27:30]  What happened?  A little sparring?  No, man.  That's how I've been hiding.  I got a little herpes on the fucking lip there.  You got a little swamp.  Fucking embarrassing.  Why?  Yes, I love Mars.  I got a little herpes.  You got a little swamp?  How long you had that?  Swamplet?  Two days.  No, I mean in your life.  Years ago, I had it about five years ago, I believe.  That comes on.  You just got it?  Five years ago?  Yeah, the first time that this broke out was about five years ago.  Was it from sucking dick?  Oh, I don't think so because I actually don't think so is his answer. 
[00:28:00]  You rule.  But I apologize for that.  Those come out because of stress.  I don't get them as much, thank God.  Oh, you used to get them all the time.  All the fucking time.  One would clear up and then the next one would pop.  Always before an appearance.  Always.  There's a million pictures of me out there with swamp light.  Really?  But I don't really get them as much these days. 
[00:28:30]  Less stress, I guess.  I don't know.  Try them.  But that virus is in you constantly and then it's the stress that makes it pop out.  Yeah.  What do you do for it?  Well, there was this cream that you get.  Creams don't work.  Prescribed?  Yeah, prescription.  Okay.  What's the cream?  Well, you got that one.  A little Valtrex cream?  Valtrex is, you take pills for them, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one.  And then they got the other one that's over the counter. 
[00:29:00]  It's 20 bucks.  As soon as you feel it, you have to put the world on Valtrex at this point.  What, does it just get all tingly or something?  Yeah, you feel it, man.  When it comes on, it's a bummer because it starts with a little tingle, a little itching.  And then it just starts growing from that point on.  Yeah.  No.  And then the damn thing pops and it's just all raw nerves.  And then you know you're stuck with it for a good week or so.  So I was hiding.  I've been hiding because of that. 
[00:29:30]  I didn't want you guys to fuck with it.  It's really noticeable.  I know.  It's so funny, though, because Mars says, I didn't want you guys to fuck with it.  I was embarrassed by it.  But if you listen to the beginning of that clip, they say, what'd you do?  Get your lip busted.  And instead of just saying yes, like in that moment, it means that Opie and Anthony believe  that his lip could have been busted.  He goes, no, just a little herpes.  He just admits to it.  Well, big Opie and Anthony show to come today.  We start the week right.  Talking about the Easter weekend of the guys. 
[00:30:00]  The guys had a long weekend.  Ant had a poker night.  Saw that on Twitter.  Jim and Opie at the Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson champs movie premiere.  Opie was on the red carpet, if you were checking his Instagram.  Whoa.  Return to the red carpet for the big start.  And Burt Kreischer in studio for the first time in a long time.  All happening today.  And the good news is, you're really not going to have to wait for it any longer.  And the reason is, because the Opie and Anthony show starts right now. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Let's go.  We're playing.  We're playing.  We're playing.  We're playing.  For more information visit www.fema.org

[00:33:30]  The year 1994  From the murky banks of terrestrial radio 
[00:34:00]  A new hope begins to rise  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts  People sure are listening  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world  As broadcasting's greatest duo  After 20 years these children of the 80s have arrived  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore 
[00:34:30]  Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony show  We're out of show on the road  Through 55 gallon drums and whiffle ball bats  You push it in until you're comfortable  From mayors to mayor  It was an April fool's pulse by two radio disc jockeys  Bottle rockets and brow bombings  And wieners and wieners and pigs  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any  Well these people will definitely stop  Guaranteed 
[00:35:00]  Lift up the cocks  They've met friends along the way  Jim Norton  I have a raging heart on right now  Can I please put my dick in your donuts  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations and terminations  It's the one show that remains unscathed  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  Comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else 
[00:35:30]  Real  This is the Opie and Anthony show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Yeah, good morning everyone  Oh boy  It's this again  We're live  We took yesterday off  Blah, blah, blah  A little Easter day  Yeah  To recuperate from our Easter  Yeah  Yeah  How was everyone's Easter? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, Fandango  Yeah  Sure  You did nothing  You did nothing  Easter is pretty much a holiday for people with kids  Even more so than Christmas, I think  Like Christmas, even if you're a regular old just a guy with no kids  You know, you still participate in the Christmas thing  It's turning into a mini Christmas  Well, yeah, right?  No, it really is  When we were growing up, wasn't it just like a few eggs laying around the house and maybe a little Easter basket you had to find on your own? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah  Now there's toys involved  Oh yeah?  Yeah  You gotta buy some toys as well  I kind of remember getting some toys as a kid for Easter  But they were  You do?  But they were so shitty that it was just kind of like, oh, this is definitely not Christmas  It was toys, but there was like chocolate in them or something  Yeah, yeah, the whole chocolate thing had a  I want to thank  I want to thank Dominic Ansel  Oh  The Cronut guy  Jesus 
[00:37:00]  Roland dropped off some of his homemade peeps  What?  And they were in a tiny little box and there were four of them  You can't make your own peeps  He made his own peeps  How were they?  Amazing  Not as good as regular peeps, though, right?  No, they were amazing  Really?  Very marshmallow-y  Oh, yeah  And that yellow stuff was just on the top  It was like, he, this guy, I'm obsessed with him  I don't tell you why  So I get the box, right? 
[00:37:30]  There's four or five, maybe six in there  I'm trying to think now, maybe six  He, he, he takes an actual egg  He hollows that out, gets it all nice  And then he makes his peeps inside the egg  That seems like the biggest pain in the ass ever  How do you make a peep inside an egg?  Huh?  Oh, I see  You see?  Yeah  You see how he just, everything is handmade  And everything takes forever 
[00:38:00]  And he can only make, like, one an hour, maybe  What is he doing?  Well, if you need to crack the eggshell and eat the peep  You gotta, you gotta break the eggshell off  It peels off nicely in the end  But I'm just thinking the effort that it takes to make these things  Like, while, you know, once again, Costco's just, there's the peep  The peep factory is squishing out a peep every fucking .3 seconds  This guy's like, good news, this guy's like, good news, I was able to make 18 today 
[00:38:30]  I really put in some O.T.  Oh, my God  But in the end, it's delicious  But I don't understand how this guy, you know, makes any money whatsoever  Don't they smell well for me in the egg?  Not at all  Because I'm sure he  He washed the egg out nicely  I'm sure he washed it out  I'm sure he has some kind of process where he probably boils it or something when it's hollowed out  And then he puts his marshmallow in there  And then there's, like, some kind of butterscotch thing in the middle  A little surprise there  And then it looks like an actual little chicken being born 
[00:39:00]  It does look like a little chickadee from that picture I'm seeing  But the effort and the time it takes to make these things  It's ludicrous  Where do you go to see it?  You can go to DominiqueAncel.com  You can just go to O&A Show on Twitter  Dominique? I like to say Dominique  But I guess it is Dominique  Because he's more French  DominiqueAncel.com  It's a Tumblr thing  Just go to O&A Show on Twitter  Alright, you'll tweet it out  Because they look amazing 
[00:39:30]  But once again, just the effort it has to take to get one of these made  Jesus H. Christ  But, you know, some of us were able to have him at my Easter celebration  Because, you know, there were only six of them  I mean, I did get him on the arm, so  But I'm just thinking, he can't make too many  No  He can't supply a whole party with these things  Hell no  So  Good for him  Very good for him  Good for him  Everything I've had from him is absolutely amazing 
[00:40:00]  Yeah  But the obsession comes with the fact that  I just don't know how he makes money  If you're making, you know, 21 cronuts a day  Uh-huh  A couple, what, seven milk shots a day  Did he have them  Cookie milk shots  Did he have them give them to Roland to give to you?  Or did he give them to Roland and Roland decided to give them to you?  I don't know why  Just wondering  What do you mean?  What's the problem there?  Are you wondering why they weren't giving out?  Oh, hell, I haven't gotten one thing from Donnie 
[00:40:30]  I was rather peopless on Easter  Well, the problem is you live on Long Island, so it's easier to get stuff when you live in Manhattan  Well, he doesn't ship to, um  Let me see  I live one building over  I couldn't be any closer  The officer could have thrown a peep out the window would have hit me in the foot  But it becomes a whole thing  Oh  I'm meeting some friends  This is Roland  I'm meeting some friends for an early brunch  I could drop off the peeps  Some friends for dinner  The peep eggs with your doorman in the AM  I'm heading into the city now 
[00:41:00]  I could drop off the eggs to your doorman  It's like a drug deal  I could be there by 830  And then he's like, I'm on my way  And then he writes, how were the peeps?  Wow  And I wrote, excellent  When's Louis C.K. coming in?  Right back to business  So you don't really know if that was given to you  Or if it was given to him and he just gave them to you  I think he's trying to help Dominic out  So he probably said something like, hey man, I know Open would appreciate some peeps for Easter 
[00:41:30]  We'll get to the bottom of this  Yeah, you could ask why you didn't get yours, that's for sure  Where's Rolando's?  But how, before we move on  How long does it take, you think, to make one of those?  It looks like a little chicken being hatched  I would say one in an hour  One in an hour, Jesus  So in a 12-hour day that he probably works there  He made a dozen  And then you know, like, Costco 
[00:42:00]  I keep going to Costco  But let's, I don't know  Let's go to Walmart, anywhere  Target  They're going to figure out how to, like, mass-produce these things  And then, you know, somebody else is going to make all the money off  They'll squish him out  Invention  Synthetic egg  Right  That's extruded out of a huge machine  Right  Yeah, they're going to figure out, ah, who cares  In the end, no one cares if it's a real egg  As long as it's good inside  Yeah  Roland, I caused a little problem here, I think  Roland  Why did I get the peeps and no one else? 
[00:42:30]  I know Jimmy, he works out and washes what he eats  And Anthony's a Long Island  Whoa, hey!  Oh, shit  Look at, look  You have kids  Look  The lava gut is almost gone  Yeah  See, you had a squint to see a little something left, right?  No, no, I would drop them off if you want  But I was wondering if Dominique said, here, give these to Opie  Or if he gave them to you 
[00:43:00]  And then you're like, I don't need it  Let me just give them to Opie  He gave me two boxes of peeps  He goes, are you seeing any of the guys?  I said, I could drop one off to Opie  I said, I'd drop one off to Opie  And I'm the closest guy, considering he lives pretty much in Brooklyn  Sure, sure  I'm one building over  Jimmy's one building over  Opie's going to throw a peep out the window and hit me in the ear  If he's sweets, I'll get it for you next time  No, thanks  Then I said, I'd drop them off to him  Now, Roland, once again  They were amazing 
[00:43:30]  Everything I've had  I haven't had a bad thing at his place  But how long does it take to make one of those?  And those are real eggs  Yeah, a long time  Well, he has a new one, too  It's like a key lime pie  But it's like a bar  Right  That one takes a while to make, too  How is it?  It's forever  Does he understand there's money to be made out there?  Yeah, you have to  It's like a process  You have to put the brown sugar in the middle  Then you get the lime  And squeeze it  But it's delicious  He squeezes the lime? 
[00:44:00]  You have to squeeze the lime once it's done  It's like made to order  Does he understand all the big boys are just waiting around to take advantage of his inventions?  I'm going to watch how it's made  It's amazing what machines can do these days  Because all it can do is  It's so good  It's like you get that little stick  Look at this thing  Oh, boy  Explain this  What does it say?  Lime me up tart  Hold on, hold on  An interactive key lime juniper tart  That comes with a mixture of  It's hard to read here  Made in  What is that? 
[00:44:30]  Malden?  Malden sea salt  Malden sea salt and sugar  For people to sprinkle into a crease  In the center of the tart  Squeeze a fresh lime wedge over to form a type of sauce for the tart  So you have to make it yourself  Yeah  Do some add-ons  Yeah  But he almost shaped it like a celery stick  So you could put your thing in the middle  It's really good  And he sold it out of them  But he made new ones  Of course he sold out of them  One person showed up 
[00:45:00]  Right  And the woman was very angry with me  Because I go, this is so good  She goes, oh, do you have an extra one?  I go, yeah, but that's mine for later  Oh, man  Like this, too  You have to put the  I know, that's my point  What is that?  That's why I'm obsessed with this guy  It's pomegranate  All these things you can see has the personal human touch  Of course  But the big boys, they're just waiting for the new dessert  They take it  They throw it in a blender to see what kind of ingredients are in there  And then they mass-produce these things  Does he make chocolate babka? 
[00:45:30]  No babka  Cinnamon babka?  The best babka is like on the Upper East Side  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  Good babka?  Very good  They have chocolate babka  That's the only babka  And they have cinnamon babka  It's just  It's a lower babka  All right  It's Seinfeld, all right  It's a lesser babka  Okay, Seinfeld  Have you ever even had a babka?  Never eaten a babka  Okay, all right  It's delicious  Had marble rye  Can we talk to Dominic and like wake him up? 
[00:46:00]  He's baking right now  I mean wake him up  To what the hell  What's going on in the world  People are taking this stuff  And making a lot of money off it  Don't you think?  I don't know  How many of those peeps did he make?  I think I think one of the last two boxes  He's not making them anymore?  No, he sold out  I mean, he put in  Of course he sold out  50 of them  And the people are just grabbing them  That's what I'm saying  50 boxes  He could have made thousands  Oh, God  And this woman offered me money 
[00:46:30]  For my box  But I was like  Nah, I'm going to eat them  Because no one's going to happen  Next year  Around Easter  Because that's the  You know  People don't really eat peeps  Right, right  Although they're trying to get  Until the holidays  Yeah, they're working  You have to have a kid to know that  Christmas peeps, really?  Yeah, they try to make peeps  For all the holidays now  That's ridiculous  But especially for Easter  You're going to see a big company  Come swooping in  Oh, yeah  And it's going to look  Very similar  Similar to Dominic  Ansel's peeps  People are going to think  It's some of that gourmet peeps  Right  They're going to be everywhere  Next year 
[00:47:00]  And this guy won't capitalize  On another one of his desserts  Yeah  Until the next holiday  It'll be the 4th of July  He'll create something  How will he cap?  He's got to make some  There's got to be a way  For him to cash in  And make some kind of real money  He needs to find  Like, you know  Some type of factory situation  He really  He really does  Just slap his name on it  Right  And start that assembly line  Of pumping  Exactly  Like a soup Nazi  What's this?  Somebody made a cheeseburger  Out of the cronut 
[00:47:30]  If that's not an insult  You're a bitch  A cheeseburger  They just cut it  And use it like a bun  Yeah  Geez  I don't think the sweetness  Would go well with that  No  That's the ultimate insult  Maybe it's full pork though  Yeah  Mmm  So anyway  Tell Dominique  The peeps were amazing  But I just don't understand  Alright  Because they have to take forever to make  Yeah  So  Who else had them? 
[00:48:00]  Did they like them?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, they were great  Peeps  Sorry to say  Do you have another box laying around  For these guys to try?  I gave them to my doorman  And their people  Yeah  I fed my apartment people  Okay  I'm going to grab you some peeps  From Dwayne Reed  No, I like regular peeps  I've always liked peeps  I've always liked peeps  I've always liked regular store peeps  I never  They're too sweet  They are sweet, aren't they?  Yeah  They are good  Oh boy, though, man  The Jimmy Norton of little treats 
[00:48:30]  That's what I was thinking  People have told me  You're very peep-like, Jim  I'm like, what do you mean  They're like, think about it  This is delicious  Someone is going to take peeps  And just shovel them into fake plastic eggs  Do you understand what I'm saying, Sam?  This guy's got a mess  That's what I'm getting at  There should be  This thing was so amazing  I know I can't  I'm still talking about this  And I apologize  But you just heard Roland  He only made 50 boxes 
[00:49:00]  Yeah  Easter's a big holiday  You shouldn't take pride in selling out  If you're not making any money  Like, if you sell out everything  And still are like  Yeah, I kind of broke even  Well, 50 boxes  Let's say it's $20 a box  I think that would be even high  What's the math on that?  What's that?  A thousand bucks?  A thousand dollars?  That's it?  A thousand dollars for his latest creation?  For 800 man hours?  Right  Yeah 
[00:49:30]  Right  Do you understand what I'm trying to say?  See, because somebody else is just going to come and figure out how to sell them in the mall  Oh, yeah  So if he's not doing it, he's just losing money  He's driving me insane  Look at the regular peeps, man  Those, they're identical  Of course  And they pump them out with a machine  It's just  Ka-chunk  Ka-chunk  Ka-chunk  Ka-chunk  Here we slowed the photography down  So you could see how the peep is actually made  Right  Because just the machine's spinning so fast 
[00:50:00]  It's just blurry  It's a blur  And then you see it's like  Wow, look at it  Squeezing out a peep  They probably made 10,000 peeps since we just started talking about peeps  And Dominic is putting the eyes on one  On one  He's just  No, it's not quite  I would like to have this one kind of looking up and to the left as the shell opens  Ah  Everyone's the same  Every peep  And now the peeps people  Because they got the trademark  They're like  Oh, good idea  Now we'll just put them in eggs  Specialty item 
[00:50:30]  Right  Except they'll put them in like chocolate shells  Of course  So after eating Dominic's limited edition blah, blah, blah  The ones that come out of the factory  People go  Oh, these are a little better  You can eat the shell  You can eat the egg in this one  I don't want to have garbage  His coming garbage  This guy wants to talk about the cronauts  They're being duplicated in a large store where I live  Of course  We did that already  Already  They're everywhere  We certainly know  Although the cheese  The cheeseburger 
[00:51:00]  That's an insult to the cronauts  Yeah  Like cronauts are so plentiful  We'll just throw a beef patty on them  Who cares  Whatever  Try anything  Let's deep fry it  Easy to find  Like secondary  Dip it in batter and deep fry it  And sell it at county fairs in the south  Oh, God  Amazing  Anyway  Sorry  But my obsession with the cronauts  No, he's amazing  I love the guy  I really know  He's the nicest guy  You go down there  You should bring a date down there 
[00:51:30]  I'm telling you  Yeah, huh?  It's a great time  You sit in the back  Mars, what do you say?  Me and you?  Let's do it  A little outdoor sort of area  I'm trying to think if there's a ceiling on his outdoor  Because it's glass walls  I don't remember now  But it's nice  You sit back there  He brings out some nice desserts  That are just as good as the cronauts  And you see a line  And you see things sell out  Because you can't make enough  I'm thinking  Jesus  Are you kidding me? 
[00:52:00]  I finally went into the t-shirt business  It's my writing on a shirt  And it sounded like crazy  Mind-boggling  There's absolutely no effort in the t-shirt that I put out  And they're selling like crazy  Like hotcakes  Like hotcakes  But not Dominique's hotcakes  Those would take hours just to make one  That would be like me making seven  Check out the Empties Mon t-shirts  Because each one had to be hand-traced and drawn  And cut to a cloth  Are you kidding me? 
[00:52:30]  Gotta stitch them together  I took a piece of paper like this  I took a sharpie and just wrote  Check out the Empties Man  And then I took a picture of that  And sent it off to the t-shirt place  That's all it takes  I'm like  Perfect  Print it  It's literally the least amount of effort  Anyone's ever put into clothing  Right  And it sells like crazy  But not this guy  Check out the Empties  That's so stupid  We're trying to find  Eh, whatever  It's for another day  We can't keep up with the demand  You gotta have to tell him make them 
[00:53:00]  We're gonna try  We gotta find a better way to do it  So  And then people are like  I thought you weren't into limited edition stuff  Isn't your shirt limited edition?  If you're not making them anymore  Oh boy  Anyway  So Easter was good?  Did you do anything?  No  Not really  Just chilled out?  Just hung out  I had people over Saturday  For a big poker game  And some hijinks  And a few shenanigans  But for the most part 
[00:53:30]  Easter, like I said  That's definitely for people with kids  Right  Because as an adult  There's nothing really to get  You don't get into the Easter spirit  There's no adult giving another adult an egg  Or chocolatey stuff like that  So it's pretty much a kid thing  Yeah  Holidays come back strong  When you have kids and get married  Yeah  Yeah, because there was a bunch of years  Most of the holidays  I didn't celebrate  I didn't give a shit  And now it's like  Oh, fuck Halloween  What's that?  Yeah  Aren't we supposed to go to a bar  And just get drunk? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, yeah  Well, even Halloween  Like, I like it  Because I usually have a party  A party, right  I have a big Halloween party  And that's fun  And stuff  So even that one  No  You could do it  There's not really  Easter really falls into that  Who gives a fuck?  But Halloween  I had to come out of retirement  And hit the streets for the first time  Right, right  For the first time in like 20 years  You had to kick it old school  I came out of retirement  Like, what?  I gotta go from house to house again?  I put in my time?  Man 
[00:54:30]  Anyway  Until he goes  Dad, I want you to come out with us this year  Can I just go with my friends?  That'll be a sad day  Oh, man  Get older, huh?  Fucking bastards  Do you understand what I did for you?  I got a few years before that  Thank God  And then  Jimmy and Sam and myself  We got ourselves into a situation  A good situation  We were like eating dinner with like Tyson and Holyfield's family 
[00:55:00]  Like, I don't know  Why were we invited to that?  I'll have the ear, please  I'll have the ear, please  I'll take this dinner  I like to think we're big shots  But I don't know if we were supposed to be in that room, Jimmy  Well, the fact that Sam was there  Right  Really brings the big shot factor  To a new low  How dare you?  Tyson's publicist is a huge fan of the show  Joanne, yeah  Her husband is a huge fan of the show  So I want to say hi to him  That's great  I don't know his name, though  I know Joanne  I never met him, I don't think 
[00:55:30]  He's a good dude  Really good dude, right?  So we got invited to the Tribeca Film Festival movie for Champs  Which was really good  It's a movie that takes a look at Tyson and Holyfield and Bernard Hopkins  Yeah  Who won, by the way?  He won a split decision, right?  Yeah  Did he win the fight, though?  Oh, yeah  Is there a controversy?  Oh, I don't know  Oh, okay  Because I saw people on Twitter saying, oh, figures, split decision, what the fuck?  So I don't know what that meant  I don't know if somebody got robbed or not  Oh, I don't know  Fucking Farrow Fawcett hair 
[00:56:00]  Oh, Linus  Linus has Farrow Fawcett hair today  Yeah  I guess  I don't know  I guess if your prostate is rotting  It just gives you fertilizer for your hair  He's got an amazing, huge head of hair  Don't Linus  He looks like Sebastian Bach today  Doesn't he?  He's got some 80s rocker hair  Major 80s hair  Yeah  You never had anything done?  You think there's something going on up there?  No  You know what?  I've never seen any point in his life where he had anything thinning or anything 
[00:56:30]  Right  Wow  It was great  But the movie was great  Yeah  It was great  Did he get choked up?  I got a little choked up at one point  Which part?  When he was talking about the guy buying clothes when he was a kid  Oh, yeah  Because he got sad  He used to start some thug in the neighborhood who bought him clothes  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Whenever really tough guys get sad, it makes me a little sad  Yeah  You become a sad boy sometimes, and when they cry, I can cry  It was 9 or 10 at the time 
[00:57:00]  Yeah  When that happened  Aw  The movie was good, man  Yeah, I loved it  I loved it  It was by that guy, Bert, who I didn't even realize we'd had him in  I forgot the director we had in  Yeah  For some of the projects  You would remember this guy, yeah  He was cool  Wow, that's fucking pretty A-list as far as boxing goes  We got invited to the after party, you know, the dinner  But I wanted a picture, I'd never met Holyfield 
[00:57:30]  Of course you did  What was Holyfield?  I said, let me try to get him  Of course you did  So I was with the Obster and Sam, we walked around, we left the building  And I thought we lost him  Yeah  And I was like, I'll just get him at the dinner  Jimmy always has his eye on the prize  Like everyone else, like, you'll get distracted if you're at one of those things  Yeah, yeah  Oh, where's Holyfield?  Ah, I don't know  But he knows his every move  Yeah, yeah  His every move  We happened to see him outside  But we didn't, I didn't try to run up to him  I was like, ah, we'll give it some  But I'll do it later 
[00:58:00]  I don't want to annoy him  And then we happened to be standing in front of the theater  And I think it was Sam that said, uh, he's right there  And I thought he was, like, you know, fucking with me  So I turned around, Holyfield was fucking eight feet away from us  Just standing with the guy  And no one was really bothering him  Oh  So you figured you would  Yes  I, uh, I went over and I got the photo  And he was not happy  Wow, really?  He took it  But, uh, he was just 
[00:58:30]  Seemed like  Damn it  Seemed like he really didn't want to be there  It seemed like both guys didn't really want to be there in a way  But they're so sick of fame, I think  They're so recognizable  I don't, I don't think that they get  They get off on any of that stuff anymore  You know where they both seemed relaxed  And enjoying themselves at the dinner  At the dinner of that  Because it was just people that they kind of knew there  We probably shouldn't have been invited to  But Jim also did not  Confront Evander Holyfield  As if he was also in show business  Oh, no  It was, there was nothing that was sort of 
[00:59:00]  Screamed peers  Yeah  Well, that's how Jimmy works, though  That's how he gets his stuff done  What did he touch his arm?  Van!  Well, you know, not far off  Oh, no  I kind of sauntered up  And they were shooing people away  But I did my, like, I'm a sick kid look at me face  Oh, your normal look  Exactly  Which meant I just walked up  Right  And Sam pointed out  That I didn't say the words properly  Oh, no  Like, I didn't say  Can I have a picture with you? 
[00:59:30]  Then I kind of little boyed it  And I said, uh, come a picture  Come a picture  I didn't mean to do that  Oh, no  He said, could  I have a picture  Come a picture  I have a picture  And Mr., I just ate some skitties  And before he could say no  Jim had already turned around and looking straight at the camera  So there's a photo of Jim just smiling  And Irvander Holyfield with a scowl across his face  Oh, that's great  Oh, yeah  He couldn't have been unhappy  Yeah 
[01:00:00]  No, I mean, uh, thank God Sam was out ready  But what did he expect?  He's out in public  Thank God for Sam  That Sam was ready with the fucking camera  That's right  You fucked that up like Erock did?  Well  On Thursday, was it?  No way  At one point, Jimmy gave me the camera  I'm like, fuck no  Too much pressure  Here you go, Sam  Out of this one  I already ruined a picture  I want to be that guy  I ruined his, uh, I think it was his zombie picture  Because the flash went off  And you could see it in  The window glare  You could see it in the window glare  Yeah  And he had to point it out to me 
[01:00:30]  I was like, I'm sorry  Look at Holyfield's face in that photo  Oh, yeah  He, oh, he just looks like  Take it  He's unhappy with me  He didn't take a lot of pictures at that point  He didn't take a lot of pictures in general  Yeah  So then, uh, then of course  We had to talk about the Holyfield picture  For the next half hour  Because we had  Oh, yeah  We had almost an hour to kill between that  And  We just walked around  And the private dinner  We shouldn't have been invited to  And we had to deal with Jim's excited  Post-successful photo op energy  Oh, yeah 
[01:01:00]  I got it  Well, but it was more than that  Like, he starts, like  He just gets overly touchy  And does this, like, friendly guy character  Like, he kept for, like, 30, 40 minutes  Oh, no  Putting his arms around me and hoping  He wouldn't stop  Boys, you know, sometimes  You want to take a photo  And, yeah, all you got to do is ask  Boys, you know, let me tell you something  Yeah, I was in my happy  I was in my happy  I kept grabbing Sam by the shoulders  And shaking him  And walking through the experience again  Oh  It was quite a good time  Did you see  Did you see the part when I went up to him 
[01:01:30]  And I, oh, God  You know, sometimes the boys  You just got  It was really fun  That would have been fun for a minute  He did that for 30 to 40 minutes  At least 30 or 40 minutes  Probably 40 minutes  A lot of laughs  A lot of touching  A lot of shaking the boys' shoulders  Oh, God  Oh, how annoying  Yeah  Nothing was normal after that  And then he wanted to get coffee  So it wasn't like  Oh, let's just go find a coffee place  He's like  Boys, I think we found a spot  To get some coffee  You want to go in here for some coffee?  Let's do it  I couldn't have been happier  Yeah, but  Let me get you a beverage  Over-energetically 
[01:02:00]  Happy  What Sam doesn't understand  Is thank God  He got the picture  Because that 40 minutes  Could have been way different  Yeah, that would have been me  What a fucking piece of shit  That fucking guy  I can't believe you wouldn't  Take a fucking picture with me  Fucking asshole  Fuck  Let's go back  Maybe he's still standing around  I gotta get that fucking picture  Put him in with the big unit  And fucking Jeter  Right  I knew I would have  I never badmouthed De Niro  I know  I love De Niro  Yeah  The big unit  Yeah, the big unit  Was just a little mean at that moment 
[01:02:30]  Certainly was  Did I get photo credit  In your book for that picture?  I'm pretty sure you did, yeah  Alright  Or I just wrote it  In this story  Where he was walking away  Yeah  I'm gonna double check  I think you did  The opster needs credit  Or he's gonna fucking sue  Damn  That would be funny  If you sued me  And I lost everything  And we had to work together  And you're like  Do it, you know  Photo credit  I'm like  I don't understand  I think that was my retirement  After that picture  I used to take  I used to take the pictures  For Jimmy  Yeah  We were at the Brooklyn Diner  And the big unit  All we see is this head  Go by the window  Because the windows are up high 
[01:03:00]  So the average person  You never see their heads  And the big unit  Just his head  And Jimmy goes  Holy shit  Then we chased him down  The story's told in his book  He went  Very funny  You know  In a very funny way  But then  Yeah  The big unit said no to Jimmy  Yeah  So I got a picture  Of sort of the back of his head  That was funny  And walking away  As Jimmy's kind of  Around the corner  Going  Unit  Unit  Andy  Big you  Big  Big you 
[01:03:30]  I was so happy  At the end of the night  Because Tyson was really nice to it  Like he likes us a lot  Like the show  And he's a really nice dude  Well let's start  But all of a sudden  They go  Okay you're upstairs  And they open this door  That's like  This door to nowhere  That goes up  Into this weird private area  It looks just like  I can't even  The door looked like  It led to a closet  But it led to these stairs  And up  Into this  Into this really nice restaurant  Into this tiny room  That was maybe  Probably not much bigger  Than this room 
[01:04:00]  And then there were like  60 people in there  And they all knew each other  Oh  And it was me  Jimmy and Sam  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  This is a closed party  Right  And you couldn't move around at all  And then  They were like  Where's the bathroom  So they go over there  And we open the door  And there's like  Just Holyfield and Tyson  Doing like a photo shoot  Pairing dicks  It was like  The bathroom area  It was like  I don't know  I didn't open it up  And Tyson's blowing Holyfield  Oh my god  Come on in boys 
[01:04:30]  It was a sitting  You'd almost have to  It was a sitting area  That led to I guess  Bathrooms  And there was some  That old lady  I don't know who she was  But she's a big deal  Was she?  I think so  Yeah  She was taking their pictures  And then with Polaroids and stuff  And having them sign the Polaroids  She was for some big magazine  I guess  They were  You could tell that  Neither one of them  Was thrilled with it  Like they were just  I think tired at that point  And they were  But they were both standing there  They both wanted to eat  And it was this back private room  Where they were doing a photo shoot 
[01:05:00]  And she was just  Like literally  Five inches from their face  With a camera  Getting close ups  And they were not thrilled  My feeling is that  They have some kind of understanding  For this movie champs  Because they didn't really socialize  At dinner  Or any of that stuff  And even during the photo shoot  They were next to each other  For the photos  But I didn't see any  Like small talk going on  So I think there  There was an understanding  Like look  We gotta promote this movie together  During the Q&A though  They did a Q&A after  At the movie  Where they all sat on stage 
[01:05:30]  And one of the promoters  Like five of them on stage  And they talked  And Tyson was really  Hilarious  Hilarious  Mike Tyson is a funny guy  Oh yeah  Really funny  And he was very like  What's the word  I'm looking for  He was very loving to Holyfield  Very praising  Of what a sweet guy he is  And a forgiving guy  And he really spoke  You can tell that he spoke  Genuinely about how much  He liked him  And you know  The fact that Holyfield  Kind of forgave him  For that whole thing  Doesn't hold a grudge  Yeah  But they both believe  They're the greatest  Of all time  And they both believe  They're better than the other guy 
[01:06:00]  Which makes it  A little tough at times  I think  I'm sure it does  So I had to jump in  And get a shot  With Holyfield and Tyson  Both of them  Yeah  You have to take that one  Above and beyond  The single picture you got  But that was just  We happened to be there  And the two of them  Were standing there  Taking photos  That's a great photo to get  It certainly is  I'll be honest  I'm not a photo guy  Like Jimmy  I mean I appreciate  A good photo from time to time  But I'm not all in  Like Jimmy  Guess who was on deck  For that same photo  Oh you got that one too 
[01:06:30]  Well there was  There was no on deck  Though officially  Uh oh  Only Jimmy got that shot  But you could have  Wow  Cause I don't know  I didn't want to be  I just assumed  Didn't want to be Jimmy  See I'm that guy  I just assumed  I would be next  Right  But as soon as the picture  Was taken with Jimmy  Holyfield and Tyson  Boy did everyone just  Scattered  Scattered away  And it was impossible  To get them back together again  You gotta ask real quick  Here's how I did that  Was we were chatting  We said hello to them  We said hello to Mike  And he was talking to us  And he was I think  Happy to see us 
[01:07:00]  Really happy  He punched me in the gut  Yeah  He likes to  He gets punchy  He does  Cause I told him  How great his book was  I was so glad  I was able to finally  Say that to him  I've been waiting for him  To come in here to tell him  And I was telling him  About how you know  How honest the book was  And stuff  And he like  He smiled and gave me  An almost shucks  And then punched me  And then punched me  Oh poof  Not hard  Not hard  Yeah yeah yeah  Just imagine like  Oh god  If you put 20%  Behind that punch  I'd be crying  Right  Yeah  So I asked him  Him and Holyfield  Were standing there  Doing something 
[01:07:30]  And I'm like  Can I get one with both of you guys  And he goes  Oh you haven't met Evander  I'm like no  And I just jumped in  And we took it  And it was like  I asked him to make that  Wow damn  And then I went  Well now it's my  Where'd they go  What  Yeah you gotta grab me  Sometimes  Can I just do one more  Because it takes them  Three seconds  And they were already  There doing that  Holyfield didn't care  But I got my picture  With Holyfield  Because we were  Basically bumping shoulders  In this dinner  That we didn't belong  Yeah there's a table  Next to us  And him and Oprah  Cut it back to back  Oh  And Jimmy's good though 
[01:08:00]  Because I'm like  I don't want to bother  For a photo  And Jimmy's like  Come on  And then he gets  Jimmy gets things done  For his people  Well I didn't want you  To not have a photo  I mean it was like  Pictures  But to me  But to me I'm like  Ah look  He's right there  He passed the salt  One time  We're good  But no we got to talk  For a little bit  It was nice  It was a really nice dinner  I just felt like  We were imposing  A bit  Yeah when the director  Did his speech  Thinking everybody  And how everybody  In the room  Was a special person  In his life 
[01:08:30]  A special person  In his life  That was closely  Associated with this project  Oh boy  I looked down  I just kind of looked down  I have nothing to do  With anything in this room  I checked my Twitter  At that point  Yeah yeah  Oh boy  I mean we'll  We'll help promote  Certainly  Because we're boxing fans  And we're friends  We're kind of friends  With Tyson at this point  But we had nothing  To do with the movie  I mean nothing  Not a god damn thing  No  And we saw him outside 
[01:09:00]  When we  That was the coolest  Yeah  Because Tyson finally said  I'm done with this room  And he left early  Him and his wife  Kind of leave separately  I think that's how  A lot of tremendously  Famous people do it  They go outside  Then the spouse does  It seems like  This way no one  The whole room  Doesn't rush over  Say goodbye goodbye  Sure yeah  And we chatted  For a few minutes  He kind of called us over  We're like hey Mike  We want to just thank you  For inviting us  Whatever  And then he's like hey  And then we talked  For a bit  Yeah  On the road  How happy were you  By the way  When Sam  Because you know  Tyson loves his hair  And Mike 
[01:09:30]  One of Mike's assistants  Was there  And looks at Sam  And sees his hair  And goes are you Jewish  I was so happy  Because Sam thinks  He has street cred  Yeah  And this guy just thought  He was a Jewish guy  Oh no  That's bad  But you know  Mike Tyson liked  My Bruno San Martino  T-shirt so  Oh he did  That was dope  Yeah he kind of did  That's what you wore  To this  Well I didn't know  It was like a dinner  And everything  I just got a text  Holy shit  I just got a text  In the afternoon  That said hey  You want to go  To this Tyson thing  And I said yeah  What is it  But the opster  Didn't respond to that one 
[01:10:00]  So I was like yeah  Whatever  I'm just going to go  Wouldn't you err  To the side of  Maybe not a  Bruno San Martino  T-shirt  No  Because Tyson loves  Bruno San Martino  I would think  Anywhere you were  Invited to go  Would not  Would like  Would qualify  More than  A Bruno San Martino  T-shirt  There's not one place  Where that would be appropriate  Not one place  I would wear that  To a Bruno San Martino  Memorial  Yes  Wow  That's a slip up  For you  Usually  These days 
[01:10:30]  You like being  A little more  Well dressed  Sam Roberts  I didn't look  I don't think  I looked out of place  You probably looked  Slovenly  With a t-shirt  With a fucking  T-shirt fits well  Nice shirt over it  Had my jacket on  And during the dinner  I very subtly  Buttoned up my shirt  Ah  So as to hide  Bruce San Martino  Were you a little embarrassed  No  At your lack of dress  No  Because I was like  I didn't know  I didn't even  Technically get invited  To this thing  I just wandered in  I had my lesbian shirt on  The same shirt I wore 
[01:11:00]  Where either Bob Kelly  Or Voss  Or probably both of them  Had to  Had to point out  That I looked like  A lesbian  Because of the color  I chose  But I thought  It was festive  For Easter  It's kind of  A violet-ish  Almost  No it's not pink  But it's certainly  Like a violet  Perish the thought  It's pink  Yeah  Oh there's me  On the red carpet  Coming out of retirement  Wow  You want to walk  The red carpet  And then  I remember  The last time 
[01:11:30]  I walked  The red carpet  Where none  Of the cameras  Went up  Like  Keep walking  Right  But safe to say  The flashes  Went off  This night  Ah  I wish  It made me  Very happy  I really wish  I was there  I would have  Wanted Sam  Holding hands  I would love  To have held  Your hands  On that fucking carpet  That would have  Been a good one  It would have  Funny  Yeah  I really didn't  Want to  And then I said  Oh okay  Let's see how  This thing is  Is there a picture  Of you with  Your Bruno  San Martino  T-shirt  No  I mean  I didn't walk  The red carpet  Oh there you go 
[01:12:00]  There's his Bruno  You can kind of  See it  Yeah  Oh you can go  To my Instagram  Opie Radio  To see all the  Tyson photos  From the big  Night out  With Jim Norton  And Sam  Nice  And Jimmy's  Growing his hair  Out for a  For a thing  You know  People are  Obsessed with  Oh I know  They are obsessed  They're very obsessed  With Jimmy's hair  They're obsessed  With everything  Any picture  Any picture  That's posted  Of us  I have a feeling  That a lot  Of the guys  That listen to us  Want to fuck us  I know 
[01:12:30]  Just how they talk  I think they want  To have sex  With us  And they can  Oh my god  Jimmy  Yeah  Yeah  Because they love  Commenting about  Everything we're  Wearing  Our hair  And stuff  I think girls  Wear busy bodies  When it comes to  Clothes and hair  I don't think  I've ever talked  About a guy's  Look before  Oh okay  Really strange to me  Oh that's a nice  Picture because  It's just kind of  Hey look  We're hanging  Well look how tiny  The room is  Yeah  Yeah that's me  And Holyfield  He's dark  Yes he is 
[01:13:00]  He's got that  Dark skin  Look how bright  You turn out  Because the camera's  Like I don't know  What the fuck  To do here  No it's great  It just ruins  The fucking sensor  The camera's like  I give up  Yeah every camera  Every photo I take  With a black guy  You can see the camera  Just bails halfway through  And they get a great  Shot of them  And they just  Wash out  Cast my pants  Well because I have  An android  You know the  Samsung  Instagram fucking  Squares off my  Pictures horribly  Oh  So I have to  Use this app  Which you know  Helps you out  So you can get  The full picture 
[01:13:30]  On Instagram  And then it  Chooses the border  You can't pick  The color  Oh  I just allow it  To choose the  Color for me  I'm not even sure  If you can pick  The color  I do all my work  In Snapseed  Snapseed  Yeah you could  Do the color  The contrast  Saturation  Shadows  You could dull down  His darkness  And bring up  Your lightness  I don't need all that  It's called  Square droid  I use  Oh  And look what color  It picked for the border  Peach 
[01:14:00]  Peach  To go with my  Complexion  That peachy  It probably should have  It probably should have  Went dark brown  No  Well  Because it tries to  Figure out what  Color is prominent  In your photo  Really  Yeah look  Good luck  Oh yeah look at that  Gray  See  I didn't put that  Border  They figure what  Color is prominent  And then they  Use that as the border  That's a pretty good  Picture you take  With the camera  That camera is  Really fucking good  This fucking  Galaxy Note 3  I mean  The video quality  And the picture quality 
[01:14:30]  Is amazing  That's the only reason  I have this  That's me explaining  How much I like this book  What are you  I'm holding my gut  Because that's right  After he punched me  He punched you  So I went like this  Going oh my god  It's going to hurt a lot  And I went oh that's right  He only punched me  Using 2% of his force  He pulled it  Yeah  He pulled it  What is this 78 year old  Man in the background  Doing  Oh that's  Everyone is commenting  That you're looking  At our dicks  Oh yes  What's Jimmy  Checking out you  Cuck  Believe me  If the two of you  Were there  If I had to  I wasn't looking  At any dicks 
[01:15:00]  Yeah  But if I was  I would have  Forgone yours  And watched  Tyson's dick  Dude I do alright  The opster does alright  I'm not saying  That it's not  A giant handful  I'm now insulted  You don't want  To look at my dick  I'm saying  I'm with your dick  20 hours a week  Tyson's dick  I very rarely get to beer  I could just check yours out  In the fucking stall next to you  With a urinal  Well I want to thank Jimmy  Because he pushed this  I wasn't even going to go  And Jimmy was like  Come on man  It'll be fun  And I had a blast  That was so much fun man  I really did  I felt like we probably  Shouldn't have been at the dinner 
[01:15:30]  But it was still nice  They invited us  We should have  We didn't know anyone Jimmy  We knew Tyson  Who we talked to  Ice-T  Was there  Ice-T and Coco were there  Did you say  What  Ice-T  Yeah  I was thinking about it  Just as a goof  Right  I walked over to  It wasn't a friendly room  Meaning I didn't know  Enough people to do that  Was it a very black person room  No  Not at all  No  Not at all  No it looked like  A lot of industry insiders  Yeah  A lot of executives  That flew in from LA 
[01:16:00]  And stuff  That's probably why  They asked Sam about  His hair  It was Jewish  What happens to this movie now  Does it  Distribute it  I don't know  It was so good though  I liked it  We've seen a lot of  Boxing documentaries  But I loved the angle  They took on this  And where these guys  Come from  And their horrible  Horrible backgrounds  And it was really  Really great  I went to shake  I was such a fucking  I went to say hello  To Ice-T  And he was very friendly  And he said hello  And as I'm leaving  He goes okay man  And we went to shake hands  But he reached up  And when he reached up 
[01:16:30]  His hand hit me  And he scratched  His hand hit me  And he scratched himself  With my Edgar nail  I scratched Ice-T with my nail  It was so embarrassing  Do you understand  He grows in  His nails for Edgar  Yeah of course  So he could  Fucking get that nail feeling  On your arm  Yeah and touch you  It's terrible  It's really strange  But I was really embarrassed  About it  I gotta trim them  Yeah  I've humiliated myself  If I'm a rapper  Anyway that was our  What night was that  Saturday  Saturday  We only said our device  Yep  And that was it  Pretty nice 
[01:17:00]  What happens is  Then I went home  And dyed Easter eggs  I suck at them  I just plop them in  Old school or new types  Of things  That shit hasn't changed  In a hundred years  Really  Vinegar and a little dye  In a cup  The little wire thing  That you're supposed  To lower them in  Even that they haven't  Fucking made better  Yeah  And I just  I used to like  Maybe do half and halves  Now I just drop it in  Dunk it in  I don't know  I like a good  Fucking ruby red  Color  Right

Probably the new CD  Or something  Yeah  He's a maniac  That guy  Yeah  Fucking energy  I've never had  Energy like him  And it was the  Everest Jump guys  Yeah 
[01:33:00]  His Sherpas  Apparently  In the avalanche  He didn't  He wasn't caught in it  They cancelled  I read yesterday  They cancelled the jump  Yeah  The guy that came in  To promote the fact  That he was jumping  Off the top of  Mount Everest  Well they had that  Avalanche  And some Sherpas  Died  And it was part  Of his team  For the Discovery  Show thing  So they cancelled  That  A few Sherpas  Were injured  That's gotta be  Some scary shit  Fuck  At 21,000 feet  They were  I think that's 
[01:33:30]  Right  I think there's  A camp around there  Yeah  And I don't know  If they got knocked  Off the mountain  Or if they got buried  Probably knocked  Right off the mountain  You gotta assume  Right  Oh man  Who knows  They're Sherpas  They're the ones  That pretty much  Know the fucking deal  Right  And they got fucked  And Boston had  Their marathon yesterday  Oh yeah  I saw a little bit  Of the coverage  From CNN  First American  Yeah in years  Since what  19  I wanna say  83-ish  Is that about right 
[01:34:00]  Yeah 1983  What  American  Yeah  Kind of looks like  Obama a little bit  Oh boy  That's racist  Is it  No  No but it would be  Well within  Anyone's means  To say it is  Look  A little bit  No  That looks like Obama  He really looks like Obama  Is he a real American  Or is he one of those  Naturalized Americans  He's a fake American  Is he a fake American  Yeah because he looks like  Every other guy  That's ever won a marathon  That's true  When you  Oh  Maybe I should shut up  Because I was about to say 
[01:34:30]  What do you think American  Well  Oh look  Is that the last time  An American one  And they show some  Fucking white guy  White guy  Oh boy  With the early 80's beard  Yeah  Right  Is this guy  Originally from Kenya  Um  American  Meb  Kalakavagazi  The hell is that about  Maybe he came when he was young  He might have come here  And he said  Yeah  I would say 
[01:35:00]  He's either Ethiopian  Ethiopian  Yeah okay  Ethiopian  Yeah those guys do very well  Born in Ethiopia  Why do Kenyans and Ethiopians  Is it cultural  Because they run so much  Where they live  Oh boy  To live  Watch yourself  Watch it  No because  Watch it  They run  Pete Correale  I think we talked about  He did a bit one time  About I think it was  An African tribe  And the way they hunt  Is they fucking chase  Deer  Down  Yeah  On foot  Nice  And they out 
[01:35:30]  They run  Until the deer  Cannot get run anymore  They hunt this thing  By running after it  Hilarious  Until it gets fucking tired  Build a gun  You dummies  But you understand  But that's  That's  There's something there  There's something there  There's something there  We can talk about that  Of course  White guys do  Don't do well with marathons  Oh boy  You had your Bill Rogers  Back in the day  He was great  And you get a guy  Here and there  But in general 
[01:36:00]  All the top spots  Are Ethiopians  And Kenyans  Are you saying  It's genetic  No because  They're only black guys  From those places  Which has something to do  With it's environmental  Because they're running  Well what if this guy  Was from Ethiopia  But he left  When he was a kid  That has nothing to do  He didn't  He didn't hunt  Or have to do that  So why is he good  I don't know  But who knows  If he did or not  When did he become  A citizen  And the current Ethiopians  Aren't hunting deer  They're not hunting deer  Running them down  So is it something  In their DNA  After all these years  Is it genetic  I don't know  He was here in 87  He's 38 
[01:36:30]  87, 13, 27, 10  He was a kid  12, okay  12, 87  Oh right  It's not  What is it  I don't know  Is it genetic  And if it is genetic  What else is affected  By genetics  As far as  Differences between races go  Huh?  Huh?  That's where you're going  With this  I thought you were  Like being nice  You know me  You thought he was  Being nice  I knew he was  Just gearing up  Anytime he sounds nice  He's gearing up 
[01:37:00]  To hit you  With a frying pan  Give me the top 10  Male finishers  Peter North  He's a good finisher  Of this year's marathon  And where they're from  I'm telling you  All right  We're getting there  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  USA wins it  Then Kenya  Then Kenya 
[01:37:30]  Then  Ukraine  UKR  Ukraine  Vitaly  Shefar  And then Ethiopian  One  That's the top five  So in the top five  You got two Kenyans  And Ethiopian  Well actually  But you have four  Out of the five  And then the guy  From the USA  Was an Ethiopian  Yes  Or that's where  He started from  So and then  Here's the women  Kenya  Ethiopian  Kenyan  Yes  Oh wait  Kenyan  Ethiopian 
[01:38:00]  Ethiopian  Kenyan  Ethiopian  So there's  There's something  There  I'm sorry  There's something  From that part  Of the world  Where the legs  Are probably  Structured differently  Oh here he goes  Jimmy the Greek  You know  The bigger muscles  In the back  Of the leg  Yes Jimmy  No but talking  About evolution  Jimmy the Norton  Well Jimmy the Greek  Would work as well  Yes  For different reasons  Talking about  The way people  Are  It's like saying  That Nordics  Have blonde hair  But you can talk  About people's  DNA 
[01:38:30]  And structure  Yeah  And maybe there  Is something  With the length  Of legs  Because there's  No reason  For that many  People  From those two  Places  Right  To be able  To run so well  I'm agreeing  Wholeheartedly  On this one  So  Jimmy Norton  I don't think  That's an odd  Thing to speculate  No  When you have  Out of the top  Top five men  Top five women  You know  The guy I want  Who's from the USA  But  Born in Kenya  Or Ethiopia  Ethiopia  So that would be  One  Two  Three  Four 
[01:39:00]  Five Ethiopians  And one  Two  Three  Four  Kenyans  Out of the top ten  And one guy  From the Ukraine  I'll agree  But you know  Sometimes stats can be  Right in front of  Someone's face  And they still  Can't grasp  What happened  Are you talking  About marathons  Yeah  Okay good  Because it's right there  You're saying  You know  There's got to be  Something there  Because look at  The statistics  Of the wins  And I'm like  No  It doesn't have to  Be something there  Because statistics  Is probably just a lie  I think if you get  Everyone into a  Good school 
[01:39:30]  Yeah  There'd be  A big change  Do you think  I do  I don't  I think there's  Some people  They're a little  Rambunctious  Marathon school  Right  Yeah  Where's your  Marathon school  Yeah  You think  You think  If an American  Or a regular  Old  American  White dude  Trained  With a  Kenyan  Or an Ethiopian  No  In the same way  That he would be  As competitive  In the marathon 
[01:40:00]  No  I don't think  That physically  He could probably  Compete  Okay  I think there's  Something to do  With elevations too  Because I think  A lot of our  Top runners  They  They have to  Move to like  Colorado  Or some of them  Do go over  To Ethiopia  Yeah  And Kenya  To train a little  Bit too  There's something  About the elevations  Is it higher there  Or lower  I don't think  They got a big  High elevation  Over there  I think they go  Up high  Yeah  Well I know  Some mountains are high  But I think  They go up high 
[01:40:30]  To train  The regular  Lowlands  I do believe  There's something  With elevations too  As far as  Being a marathon  Runner  Yes  I do want to  Know why  Ethiopia  And Kenya  It's not even  All  It's not like  The sedan  Is putting out  Great marathon  Runners  Although if I  Find out the sedan  Is in one of those  Places  I'm just a  Geographical idiot  But it's two  Places  It is just  Two places  In the world  That are putting  Out the majority  Of what is it  About those two  Places  Because they  Probably have a  Program that  You know  Trains people  For that  And I think  They're used to 
[01:41:00]  Just being hungry  Oh see  Now  And you know  You're starving  Yourself when  You run a marathon  Literally  Your body starts  Eating itself  Because you're not  Supposed to go over  You're not supposed  To run more than  20 miles before  Your body can't  Handle that anymore  So what your body  Does it just  Starts eating itself  So then what other  Starving nations  Like India  Right  How about  There should be  Some Indian  Yeah let's say  Hi to Dave in  Jersey  Dave  Hey what's  Going on guys  Hey buddy  Yeah so  I was calling 
[01:41:30]  Kind of what  Jimmy said  It's not  You know  Everybody from  Africa is a  Great runner  It's a pretty  Small area  Of a place  In Kenya  Ethiopia  And Eritrea  Where they're  Really good  Runners  Where they're  Just they're  Naturally  Predisposed  But kind of  Like you're  Talking about  The Sherpas  On Everest  Those Sherpas  For the past  You know  Five thousand  Years have been  Living on the  Himalayan plateau  Those guys  They have more  Red blood cells  You know  They're long  They have a  Higher  When they breathe  How much air  Goes in and out  Volume 
[01:42:00]  When their  Heartbeats  Through evolution  Or for the last  Couple thousand years  They're naturally  Predisposed to being  Better at  Particular things  So all those  Years of hunting  I'm sorry  So does that  Have anything to do  With you think  The hunting  Or whatever  Like all those  Years that  There's something  Different about  Their makeup  Maybe like you  Said the amount  Of red blood cells  Or the way  They breathe  If that's the  Way that they  Hunted  Then you'd think  That there would  Have been some  Natural selection  For people who  Are better at  Endurance  Could more easily 
[01:42:30]  Run down  A gazelle  And eat it  And feed their  Family  So you know  You do that  For long enough  For you know  10,000  20,000  50,000 years  You might  There might be  Some selection  For that  I also think  That that area  Of Africa  Is at an  Elevation  Of course  It is  I knew that  That's why  I said elevation  Sir  And also  It's survival  To  Call up in five  Minutes  They don't know  Crap  They're very skinny  And they have  Long legs  Because let's  Be really honest  There's a lot  Of shit that  Will eat you  In that part 
[01:43:00]  Of the world  That is true  So part of  Your survival  Is being able  To run the fuck  Away very quickly  And to make sure  You don't have  Any of that  Fat on your body  Yes  That shit is delicious  Run  That's some delicious shit  Big eyes to see  Really well  Like let's  Let's amscray  So how did this guy  That came over  12  How did he win  He was born  Genetics  Genetics  Okay  That's what I was saying  It's genetics  It's not just  Trust me  It's not just  You know  That you're born there  But if your genetics  Give you that extra 
[01:43:30]  Like the guy said  With the Sherpas  The extra blood cells  And the oxygen thing  You're 12  You're born there  You're not far enough  For a move  Where your genetics  Are going to change  It's happening  You're just right there  Yeah  But it's more about  They're predisposed  To have a little bit  Of an advantage  It doesn't mean  That you can't be  A great marathon runner  Growing up  In New Jersey  Or that you can be  A crappy marathon runner  Being from Aritrea  Yeah  Of course  It's all  It's never 100%  But it's every year  These guys  You've got to play the odds  Every year  Yeah  But also look at  Sprinters 
[01:44:00]  There's good sprinters  Coming out of Jamaica  It's not even  All of the island of Jamaica  It's like one little town  Right  Where there's  Really good sprinters  It's so weird  How that works out  Well sometimes though  If some place  Becomes known for that  That's where the people  Go to train  And to  You know  Be from that place  So they have an advantage  It doesn't necessarily  Mean the place  Does it  It means that  It's drawn people  That have natural ability  Well then the numbers  Are pumped up  Because then you get  Other people going there 
[01:44:30]  To train  Is that what you're saying  Yeah  Yeah  And that becomes the place  Like if you're  Let's say  You know  You go to Kenya  Just to train  To be  You know  Will that help you  I don't know  I think that  Does it like  It'll help you to a point  I mean we send a lot  Of our athletes  To you know  Yeah  Colorado and stuff  To train  Up in the  5,000  Yeah  Up in the high altitudes  So  Yeah  But I don't know  To what extent  Let me go on to 
[01:45:00]  Jay in Jersey  Jay  Hey guys  Hey  What's up  Hey I saw something  On ESJet  It said that the majority  Of Kenyan  Marathon winners  Are from the same tribe  It had something to do  With running from  Tigers and shit  And  Tigers  Tigers in Africa  No  Altitude  The altitude  You said tigers though  No I said  Yeah  Running from tigers  And  In Africa  Yes sir  Is there no tigers  In Africa  No  Lions  They get the lions 
[01:45:30]  How about that  Okay  How much  Out of the thing  All right  Thanks  Yeah  It's probably just lions  Let's say hi to  Brandon in Baltimore  Brandon  Hey what's going on  Hey man  I just recently  Heard a  Radio Lab podcast  And  The Kenyans  Actually  There's a certain tribe  Where they do  A coming of age  Ceremony  And  If you show any pain  Or if you wince  At all  You're like shunned  By the tribe  And like a large  Number of 
[01:46:00]  Messiah  Marathon runners  Are from that area  So  It makes it sound like  There's still  All these  Tribes doing these  Primitive things  The guy's probably  Staying in a fucking hotel  Wouldn't you be the guy  That just goes  Ow ow ow ow  I'll go live over there now  Yeah  Hopefully someone  Will join me eventually  You'll have enough space  Why would you go through  One of those rituals  Like that  Yeah  Then again I dropped  Well how about the  I dropped marshmallows once  From your Heidi  From my Heidi  Just so I can have 
[01:46:30]  Beer with the guys  Great  Great  Can't I just have  Beer with the guys  Why do I have to  Why do I have to do that  I don't understand  Well this guy  Was an American though  And he's just got  Kenyan  Kenyan background  Yeah  He didn't train over there  I don't know how  Genetically  Well  Well we got a guy here  Berto  Hey man  I know why  They're good runners  My wife trains  With the sister  Of the Boston Marathon  Who's the sister 
[01:47:00]  Of the Boston Marathon  Her name is  I believe it's  I can't even  Say the name  Oh boy  But  But  The thing is  That  They train  For economics  The winners  Get  You know  A million dollars  Nobody out there  Has a million dollars  So  They see all these  Runners come back  With  You know  All these purses  And that's why  They train  Actual purses  Why would you spend  Your million dollars 
[01:47:30]  On purses  That's so silly  No  I'm sure  Ant has an answer  For that  They come in  With all this money  I get what you're saying  That plays into it too  Because now you're like  Whoa  This is a way  I could get rich  Yeah  So then maybe  That motivates you enough  And maybe you had  Some natural skills  Behind you  You didn't even realize  And that was the  Motivational factor  Yeah  And they go all over  The world  And look for the  Perfect elevation 
[01:48:00]  And they live  There's groups in Mexico  Up in the mountains  Training  And they  They train  In that area  And hit all the races  That have purses  That there's prize money  They don't race  Just a race  They only race  Where there's a purse  Something purse  All right  No right  Yeah  The lips are all purse  Physically though  If you want to be  A good marathon runner  Obviously you need  Long  Slender  Legs and body  Right 
[01:48:30]  Right  And there's certain  There's just certain  Physical attributes  That are conducive  To being a marathon runner  That's it  Well you know  That's what you got  A short  A group of people  That are normally  Like Peruvian people  Normally a lot shorter  Shorter legs  You don't see many  Peruvian marathon runners  And you got to eat  Like twigs and stuff  And dirt  Right  A lot of dirt  In your diet  I mean the American marathon  Runners 
[01:49:00]  They're throwing a cheeseburger  At them as well  Are they ever  That's just not  Oh  Your competition's not doing that  No  And you got to make sure  Your hotel gives you  The wake up call  Or you have a friend  That knows to wake you up  On time  So you're not late  For the marathon  Because that  Would be tragic  Do I have to say  Seinfeld every time  What  If I don't  They get mad at me  I think they do  He got three  By you today  One more 
[01:49:30]  Blake in Florida  We're going to wrap up  This discussion with you  So make it good  Go ahead Blakey  It's Luke  Blake  What's up Lukester  Hey Luke  Hey well I actually  I'm your father Blake  What  In Manif Lake California  Just keep talking  I have no idea  What you're talking about  Because we were having  A little fun with you  And you ignored that part  Of the phone call  Very very into just  Telling us what he knows  Go ahead Luke  Go ahead Dol  Luke 
[01:50:00]  Alright  Yeah I live in the same town  As Meb  Out in California  It's a ski resort town  I just grow up  Shooting womp rats  8,000 feet  And he's been running  Around town all the time  And then he takes  The gondola up  To 11,000 feet  After running  I don't know  How many miles he runs  And then that recovers  At 11,000 feet  So  Pretty cool  I guess that plays  Into the whole  Winning the Boston Marathon thing  Uh huh  I'll be honest 
[01:50:30]  I just assumed  Either you or Jimmy  Were going to listen to this  Usually we have a  It's kind of a  Redundancy that we have  If you're not listening  I'll be listening  Jimmy  Right sure  I think we had a  Triple failure there  Really  You're saying how  Map  His guy's name is  Was running around town  You'd see him running around  All the time  Like I guess  For years  That they saw this guy  Training  Oh  Alright  Okay  Thank you  Jimmy  Got it  It's almost impossible  To be a white guy  And win  The marathon 
[01:51:00]  Yeah  The big marathons  Right  The Boston Marathon  The New York City Marathon  The Marathon  The Marathon  If there's a lot of money  To be made  It's really tough  For white guys  To excel at that sport  So it really is ridiculous  For people to go  You can do  Or be anything you want  Because sometimes  You're just not  You're not dealt that hand  Right from the get go  Right  You know  If you're a  Dumb white guy  With short little legs  You're not fucking 
[01:51:30]  Winning a marathon  Several reasons  One is because  The Kenyans are used to  Running with no shoes  And the bottom of their feet  Are harder  The guy's 12 fucking years old  He came over to the states  He probably put Nivea  On his feet every day  He wore a lot of Nikes  Yeah  I love these things  That come out  From fucking  600 years ago  Well  The tribe he had  They put a bone  In their hair  And that  No one's doing this  He's 12  He comes over here  Let's say hi to Steve 
[01:52:00]  On Long Island  Steve  Yes  Hey what's up boys  Hey  Hello  So yeah  Once in a while  I'm not sure you guys  Aren't retarded  Because I'm pretty sure  If like LeBron James  Wanted to play  Wanted to do marathon running  Instead of being a basketball player  He'd probably be the best at it  He's been American for a while  You think  You think LeBron James  Could be a good marathon runner  And you're calling us retarded  And we're retarded  A guy that bulky  And an idiot  You're crazy  And that tall  Most marathon runners  Are not that tall 
[01:52:30]  They're not 7 foot  No  Well LeBron's what  6  If there wasn't more money  He made running a marathon  Than playing basketball  That must be it  I bet if Michael Jordan  Played baseball  He would have been one of the best  Oh that's right  Shut up  We're talking about running  Although he had a giant  Strike zone  Was the problem  Yeah  Sir you're incorrect  A guy like LeBron  Could not have been  He might have been  A decent runner  A fast guy  Because he's a great athlete  He's not trained  To fucking  Oh yes I was saying  Of course he's not trained  I'm sure he'd be trained for it 
[01:53:00]  He'd probably be  No  No  I don't think so  No  What about people that  He has the wrong body type  For that particular sport  Yes  That's why you don't see  Midgets in the NBA  That tall  Wrong body type  What  Well midgets  I mean that's a little silly  I demand you take back  Your retard statement  Why is that silly  It's the same  Point you're making  How is that silly  Because again  LeBron James  Are like again  Like Michael  LeBron James  LeBron James is a giant  And would be a shitty  Marathon runner  Right  So my point isn't silly  That's like saying 
[01:53:30]  A midget can be great  In the NBA  So you're saying  A tall canyon  Can't be good  But a short canyon  Can be good  A tall canyon  To a certain height  Not a 70 foot tall canyon  Not almost 70 feet tall  It's calling around  Much too much real estate  With you  Alright  Maybe LeBron James  Wasn't the best example  But like  It was a horrible example  Because you're retarded  Yeah  Remember you called us  Retarded though  Yes  In this conversation  Well if I hurt your feelings  I'm sorry  No you didn't hurt your feelings  You just wrecked your credibility  You're just an idiot  Because you're not  You know you have to  Take 10 minutes  To admit that you're incorrect  Although Muggsy Bogues 
[01:54:00]  Was almost a midget  In the NBA  Yeah  And he did very well  What was he  5'4  What  I bet he would be  A good marathon runner  What  Thanks help  Muggsy Bogues  A good marathon runner  No  I'm sure he'd be awesome at it  Muggsy Bogues  Actually tried to run  The New York City marathon  Oh  And he couldn't finish it  Dude  He did I think  I want to say 15 miles  And he couldn't finish it  Wow  I understand that  But it wasn't  See I just made that up  I wanted to show you  How easy it is  Just to throw nonsense facts 
[01:54:30]  Around in these discussions  I have no idea  If Muggsy Bogues  Has run more than  10 feet in his life  10 feet  I think Muggsy Bogues  Was more of a shuffle runner too  I don't think that style  Would do well  In a marathon  I believe he shuffled along  Up and down that court  I just think that  A really great American athlete  Want to be a marathon runner  As opposed to playing basketball  And making $100 million  Or opposed to playing basketball  I kind of understand  Your point a little bit  Because actually  They tackled that point  In the movie  Me and Jimmy  Just saw over the weekend  And Sam  Champs 
[01:55:00]  They said a lot of guys  Are choosing other sports  Than becoming boxers  Because the sport  Is shitty right now  So they're like  You're getting your big strong guys  That would be your new heavyweights  To keep that whole thing going  They're going into football  And basketball  And other sports  So I understand your point  Slightly  Yeah  Well I'm sorry  I called you retarded boys  Thank you sir  Even though you were right  They're basically saying  If boxing can clean up  Their own sport  Then you would see  That heavyweight division  Come back strong again 
[01:55:30]  But people are like  Fuck this  I ain't going into that sport  They don't have their act together  So they go into other things now  Yeah  I was amazed  Holyfield talked about  They're like  Rich kids don't box  So it's a poor kid's sport  Right  You kind of get why  Because you don't have to  But Holyfield's mother  Couldn't read  His father couldn't read  Like he comes from  A really bad  Like a really  I mean that's a huge  Disadvantage to start with  And he's lucky  He could fight that  Well  Ali had some money  Growing up didn't he  A little bit  But Ali  Ali became a fighter  Because some kid 
[01:56:00]  Stole his bike  And he was  Some people  Probably just naturally  Gifted fighters  And Ali  Who was also very smart  He was the smartest fighter  I mean as opposed to  Being the best  He was the smartest  And he fucking  He wanted to beat that  Kid up and get his  Bicycle back  And so that's why  He started training  He had a reason to  He didn't do it  Because he was getting  Beat up every day  He just wanted to  Get his bike back  Most of the big names  Though started out  Very poor  And then there was  A lady that stood up  There was a little  Q&A after the movie  Oh yeah  And she stood up  Talking about her son  Who was bullied in high school  She's a rich lady though  She has money  Oh yeah  I was getting to that point 
[01:56:30]  And so her son  Got bullied  So she got him  Into boxing  You know  So now he walks  The halls  And no one fucks  With him  Type of story  Which was awesome  To hear  And then  She's really worried  Because you know  He now wants  To go into boxing  So she's very rich  As Jimmy said  And because  I guess she was  Saying to the guys  Look you said  Only poor  Poor kids box  But my kid  You know  We have a lot of money  And he still wants  To be a boxer  So she asked  The panel  How do you get him 
[01:57:00]  To not want to box  And Tyson  That's why he's hilarious  He goes  Know how you get him  Not to box  You have him box  Because you get  Hit a few times  And you realize  Fuck why am I doing this  If you have to do it  You'll do it  Thank you  If you don't have to  Yeah you'll probably be like  Ow  A few of those punches  To the head  And you might just say  You know what  I don't need this  I'm done with this  Yeah a kid might  Might be a talented athlete  He might throw pretty well  But then he'll fight  Some kid that you know  Who has probably been  Fighting a lot  You know in the 
[01:57:30]  Fucking hallway of a project  Since he was six  Right  Yeah  Some guys are just  Harder to knock down  They just have those  Fucking heads and jaws  They can just take a shot  Big jawed people  Yes big jawed people  Big jawed  Even UFC  You see like guys like Liddell  Just a big solid  Bulldog head  Scott in Jersey  Hello  Hey Scott  What's up Scott  Hey uh  I didn't realize  It was Black History Month  I don't understand 
[01:58:00]  Uh  All we're talking about  Is uh  Negroes  All we're talking  Well we're talking about  The marathon  Which just happened  And the boxing event  Which Sam and I  Just went to  What would you  And all you hear  Is us talking about  Negroes  That's all it is  What would you prefer  To talk  What would you prefer  To talk about  White Night  I can't do the show anymore  I just can't do it  Let's talk about  Jimmy being a pussy  In Edison High School  Uh I didn't go to  Edison High School  Stupid  He didn't drink beers 
[01:58:30]  And rip bong hits  Rip bong hits  So hold on  What  And he goes away  Yeah  What a twat  The show's not for everybody  I guess  No but of course  He hangs up  Anyway  Not for everybody  Jimmy was saying  Something there though  Fuck  Oh the UFC fighters  Joe Rogan  Had a great podcast  This has got to be  I don't know  Four or five months ago  And they were talking  About the guys  That go into UFC  And a lot of those guys 
[01:59:00]  Had major issues  Growing up  And that's why  They were  They pushed themselves  Toward that particular sport  Or abusive brothers  You were saying that  They had  Okay yeah  They had brothers  That beat the shit out of them  Just horrible abuse  At home  And a lot of those guys  Their back story  Not all of them  But I would say  A majority of the guys  In MMA  Have crazy ass backstories  And that's why  They're in MMA  Whether they were  Bullied at school  Bullied at home  Or what have you  There was a great fight  Recently  The heavyweight championship 
[01:59:30]  Is going to be  Cain Velasquez  Against a guy named  Fabricio Verdum  Who's the guy  Who actually beat  Fedor for the first time  He's a giant  Brazilian jiu-jitsu  Black belt  What a fucking  Great fight  A lot of poor guys  Are great at basketball  Because it doesn't take much  To get a hoop up  And a ball  A lot of very rich guys  Are professional golfers  I loved golf growing up  We couldn't afford it  We were caddies  So we got to play  Here and there  But that was a rich man's game  And it still is  Even though Tiger  Has changed it a bit 
[02:00:00]  Over the years  The poor sport  Is polo  Polo's a very poor sport  Exactly  Well hold on  No  I thought  Imagine  You take your  Raggedy horse  Your ragged shit  Your ghetto horse  Your ghetto horse  Your stick with a horse head on it  Because that's all you can afford  Yeah you'll do just as well  As the rest of the guys  Yeah  Ghetto  Oh shit  Right  Yeah  Obviously  Yeah 
[02:00:30]  Economics has something to do  With the sports  People choose  Right  How well they do  Yeah  How would animals do  In a marathon  You think  Oh wow  Let me think  Which one  A sled dog  You know how well  A sled dog would do  Oh my god  You're right  Like an Iditarod  Fucking dog  But they're stupid  Because all of a sudden  They're not running  On the marathon  Route anymore  They could be distracted  With a hot dog  How many times  Could they be distracted  And still be that far  Ahead of humans  Where they could get back  On track 
[02:01:00]  I bet they could  Fucking beat them  If they stop  Taking piss  Shit  Even if they take a left  For a mile or two  Do a little frisbee catching  Right  In the fucking common  And then they just  Fucking get back on  And finish off  Horse  Would fare well  In a marathon  I think it'd do very well  If it could focus  Well  You need these damn things  To focus  And stay on  Blinders on  On the route  That would be good  Or the route  Depending on what  Part of country you're from  I guess  I think horse  And a husky  That's why I laugh at 
[02:01:30]  Pretty good  Humans are just  We're just ridiculous  Cheetah  Michael Phelps  Swimming against a dolphin  It wouldn't even be close  Oh my god  Michael Phelps  Would look stupid  That's true  But good luck  For that dolphin  Fucking catching  Michael Phelps  In the net  And eating him  And all his friends  Wait on the dolphins  Let's see when they make  A fucking thing  Called the cold  About Michael Phelps  And his friends  Getting trapped  And chopped up  Into pieces  Exactly  We win  But I thought  They were intelligent  Exactly  I'm intelligent enough 
[02:02:00]  Not to  Get myself stuck  In a net  In a net  Chopped up  Right  At least try to  Talk your way out of it  If you're intelligent  And you're in the ocean  Wouldn't you think  Okay I gotta look out  For nets all day long  Yeah  All day long  That would be  The first thought  When you open  Your little dolphin eyes  In the morning  I'd be like  All I gotta do  Is learn a couple  Of fucking words  In this thing's language  And I'm set  Exactly  Then I could just say  No  Ow  Family  Right  Living  Me  And people go 
[02:02:30]  Whoa  Learn how to use  Your eyes better  To make us feel  Sorry for you  Yeah yeah  Is that the guy  Right outside  The marathon  What happened  Oh was that him  There was an old  Footage they showed  It was just  They must have been  Fox and Friends  Will have the marathon  Guy on  Yeah  But you're right  Dolphins aren't that smart  Stop with that  No they're not  They get themselves  In some predicaments  Some tricky situations  That we would just  Step to the siding  And avoid  Wouldn't you not  Put that mine  On your back  And swim to the ship 
[02:03:00]  That they told you  To fucking blow up  Exactly  Back in the day  Exactly  Or wouldn't you  If you were a dolphin  And you heard Asian voices  Like a Japanese accent  How do you know  Don't go above  Leave  Yeah they're not good to you  Leave  I heard this one  I'll let Jim  Get some credit  I did hear this one before  Credit  It goes with what we're saying  Go ahead Jim  Hey what's up boys  Hey  I definitely had heard  That Jim Brown  Was definitely the best  Lacrosse player of all time  But obviously  He chose football  There's no  And I know Anthony  Is never going to watch  Lacrosse again  But I know that  They said he was 
[02:03:30]  The best lacrosse player  Of all time  But there's no money in that  I don't know if it was  Of all time  But he was extremely  Well  Good at lacrosse  As well  But yeah  And I know  With you playing golf  I remember when you  Played against Judge Snell  And that tournament  You did great  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  But you can take  Lacrosse and football  And there's a lot  Of crossover  In your athletic ability  And your ability  To play the game well  I think  In lacrosse and football  Lacrosse is a great sport  The same things 
[02:04:00]  That make you great  In lacrosse though  You could take the football  You're strong  You're fast  That's what you're saying  Right  Things like that  But Jim Brown  Didn't have a chance  Being a pro golfer  No  That's more our point  I guess  Exactly  Because lacrosse  Lacrosse  You can almost  Make your own  Of course  You can almost  Make your own sticks  Especially when he was  Playing back then  Why don't we watch  Lacrosse on TV  I don't know  It's a great sport  It really is  You know  Mariano Rivera  Actually  I don't know  If you've heard this  He made his own glove  Of what  It was out of a 
[02:04:30]  What the fuck  Was it made out of  A box  Oh  Cardboard  Cardboard  No no no  It was the fake grass  In the easter egg basket  Who called him out  And said  If you tell that  Fucking story again  It was you right  I think it was  Steiner right  Yeah  Steiner  He was going into  His Mariano Rivera  Mariano  Story  He made a glove  He took a cardboard  And tape  And yes  And you go  If you tell that  Fucking story  I couldn't sit  Through it again  Because we allowed him  To tell the story twice 
[02:05:00]  Yes  Because the second time  We all heard the story  About  You know  When you do a radio show  Sometimes you gotta go  You can't say  We heard that already  Because you know  There's a lot of people  That probably didn't  So you allow  The guy to do it again  But not a third time  Fuck that  He was trying for the three-peat  Right  Let's say hi to Dan  In Pennsylvania  Dan  Dan the man  Hey what's up  Hey man  Welcome Danny  I wanted to ask Jim  Is Monsterain a rich man  Or a poor man's game  That's  You know what  It's a great question  That's a smart man's game  Because you learn  Because you learn how to have fun 
[02:05:30]  At a young age  When somebody doesn't have  Parcheesi or sorry  Parcheesi  What an awful game  Parcheesi was  Oh sorry about that  Gordon in South Carolina  Says I can't listen to this  But for another reason  Go ahead  Hey guys  Hey  Yeah I was actually  Hoping to follow Scott  Because the pressure  Was completely off  But anyway  This  Talking about the  You know  The marathon runners  From Kenya  It's pure Darwin  Darwinian natural selection  You know 
[02:06:00]  Darwin went to the Galapagos  For a reason  Because it was isolated  Now you think about  These tribes in Africa  Just talking about the Kenyans  These are isolated tribes  That to your point  Had to hunt  And chase down game  To survive  So if you put  Anthony's short-legged Peruvian  Next to the  You know  The long-legged Kenyan  20,000 years ago  Which one of them  Is going to survive  Yes  And by surviving  They're able to  Reproduce  And those genes  Move on  That is purely  Darwinian natural selection 
[02:06:30]  And that's why  Living in South Carolina  Pisses me off  That they're trying to teach  You know  They're trying to get away  From teaching evolution  It's  There's proof of it  Looking around you every day  You talk about those  Those sled dogs  That's forced evolution  That's human  Human created evolution  Basically  You know  It just drives me crazy  Your listeners  Are just a bunch of  Misappoint  Kids got to learn  About evolution  So what  It's going to be up to  Us parents  To teach evolution 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  I mean  They're talking  I didn't pay attention  That closely  But this is a real issue  They're taking evolution  Out of schools  Left and right  Are they really  Yes  That's the religion thing  Not only are they  Taking evolution  Out of schools  They're attempting to  They're trying to  Teach intelligent design  And creation  Right  Creation  Anybody in this  Day and age  I mean  You might as well  Tell me the fucking  World is flat  As much as  6,000 years  Oh I know 
[02:07:30]  Come on  Look at the map  Right  Yes  The maps are flat  God what dopes  They really think  That they're teaching  Creating  Above evolution  But they're not teaching  Look  If you have to  Hold on  Hold on  If you have to  Teach both  Teach both  Whatever  But you can't  Just blow off  Evolution  And say  Ah  We're going to  Just teach you  You know  Creationism  A religion thing  Yeah  Especially in the south  Absolutely  And I'm originally 
[02:08:00]  From Toronto  So you know  I have a little bit  Broader  Broader world base  But  It just  I mean  Why are  Why are the  Peruvians  Legs short  Because they're  Going to walk  Up those  Fucking mountains  Those mountains  It's not  Why  It sucks  It's not  Why  It's because  They only make  Short pants there  And the Peruvians  Are always tripping  Over their pant legs  I had no idea  Jimmy  They evolved  Into a shorter  Legged people  Because of their  Pants  Absolutely  The Peruvians  All wanted to wear  Cargo shorts  As long pants  And now they can  I got you  Because the ones 
[02:08:30]  That didn't have  Pants would die  Of exposure  How long are we  Going to do this  I'm just kidding  I'm just kidding  Thank you  Gordon  Thank you sir  So the Pope  How old does he  Think the earth is  How old  He'll probably say  6,000 years  But he has to sit there  And say the earth  Is 6,000 years old  I don't know  He knows how old  He knows evolution  I bet he wouldn't  Say it  Of course he wouldn't  Say it  But what would  His stance be  His stance has to be  It's only 6,000 years old 
[02:09:00]  I don't think  That is a  Universal belief  That's why I'm asking  Because I don't know  Like  Catholicism  Right  I don't think it is  I think it's this thing  That these  Religious  Scientists  Have decided  That's how we  Cover this  Evolution thing  We say that it was  6,000 years ago  And dinosaurs and people  Trucking around  Even though you can't  Find any evidence  Through bone fragments  Or anything  Where dinosaurs are 
[02:09:30]  Mixed with human bones  In the same levels  Of sediment  And stuff  It's amazing  The science  That contradicts  Everything that they say  Yet they just  Don't want to look at it  There's obviously  Been documentaries  And things done  On these Kenyan  And Ethiopian runners  And someone just  Twittered me  He goes it has to do  With the mitochondrial DNA  That makes Kenyans  Have an insane  VO2 max  And leg strength  So it's all probably  The blood  Whatever VO2 strength  I don't know  What that is  VO2 max  I would 
[02:10:00]  As soon as the oxygen  And your  Your ability  For your blood  To hold  And transport oxygen  Red blood cells  Muscle fiber  And organ  Oxygen  Red blood cells  Stuff like that  I'd say that  Right  Yeah  More of  The above  Sam  Comment  Maximal  Oxygen  Consumption  Nice  See I don't have  Very good VO2 max  No  No it seems like  My body takes in oxygen  And throws it away  Immediately  No thanks  We don't need this 
[02:10:30]  We don't need this  Goodbye goodbye goodbye  Yeah no thank you  Goodbye goodbye  We don't need this  We're gasping for breath  No sleep  Thank you anyway  Goodbye goodbye  Take care  I don't know  How do veins get  Oxygenated blood  On top of the roof  Like a weather vane  Is that what you were  Going for  Yeah  Wow  Was that a bad joke  Oh  Worse than a bomb  That's germ warfare  Was that a clunker 
[02:11:00]  Wow  That was a stinker  Like if  They're made up of cells  Right  Of living cells  That need to  Be replenished with oxygen  I would think  Like every cell  In your body  Would rot  If it didn't get  Nutrition  From the blood  But it's only  Bringing back  The deoxygenated blood  That's already  Been spent  So how  Do the veins  How do veins  Get nutrition  I don't know this  Dr. Steve  Help me 
[02:11:30]  They are  I need to learn  I need to learn  Let's say  You should open yours  And look at them  And ask them in the tub  Jimmy wants me  To kill myself  No I don't  I want you to research  Just a little research  Blake in Wisconsin  Go ahead Blake  Hey there  I'm enjoying  The run and fez  Which animals  Would run faster  Brakes  Yeah that's kind of  A run and fez bit  I gotta be honest with you  It's kind of  The road they go down  Every once in a while 
[02:12:00]  Last year  A golden retriever  Got out  Escaped  And I don't remember  Which marathon  It went on  But it ran  The whole damn thing  And then like  After the marathon  The next day  It died of a heart attack  Yeah I think it was  I think it was a day later  Because I believe  They did all sorts of stories  On how cool it was  That the golden retriever  Ran the marathon  Oh no  And then  They had to kind of  Update their stories  And a tragic side note  To the story  I think you'll find that  Sam  I believe that's how  It played out  No it's fine  I think I know what happened  That dog actually was healthy 
[02:12:30]  But then he saw  McGruff the crime dog  And he realized  Well I could have just  Done that for a living  Why  Whoa  Look at this  Fucking  God damn  Mountain lion  Came out of someone's roof  Why  I don't know  It's crazy  It started attacking some dude  Why are you living among  Among  Mountain lions  The mountain lions  Crazy  Amongst  Love it  Amongst  Amongst  The mountain lions  Let's say hi 
[02:13:00]  To Mike in D.C.  If you got that  Golden retriever story  Let me know  Mikey  What's going on boys  Hey Mike  Hello  I don't know  If you guys  Talked about this already  But the shooting yesterday  At the national zoo  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  There was a shooting  And a couple of stabbings  Where was the national zoo  Washington D.C.  Okay  It was also  National  Easter Monday  It was African American Family Day  There  At the 
[02:13:30]  At the national zoo  And  You know  There was some trouble  Some stabbings  And a shooting  What the fuck  It's just  For the umpteenth  Second of year in a row  Basically  I happen to be driving through it  Right as it happened  And  There was about a million  Little nigglets  Standing on  Oh my god  Look  We can  We can discuss things  We can discuss things  Race related  Without  Resorting to  Uh  Ridiculous name calling sir  That is correct  Thank you  I apologize  All right 
[02:14:00]  Whatever  Wow  Anyway  Punching out  Is that the  I'm sorry  Is that the inside of the plane  A wheel well  That's how big a wheel well is  Wow  Yeah  That's where  Oh he's lying down  Okay  But we got a kid that  Made it from where to where  LAX to  Hawaii  Five hours  38,000 feet  And he was passed out  For most of the flight  Because no oxygen  No oxygen  Freezing  Below freezing  So how did he survive  Without the oxygen part  Must have been very minimal  That's what they're saying  They say about 
[02:14:30]  A quarter of the people  That try this  Actually live  And most of them die  So you pass out  Because there's no air  And it's freezing  So how did he survive  I don't know  He passed out  How are they saying he survived  And then he said  He said he had a heart attack  On descent  Did he  Yeah  That's what they were saying  How old is he  Fifteen  They say when you pass out  That you go into  Like a hibernation state  Where you know  Your body adapts  The cold doesn't affect you  As much  And you slow down  Your oxygen intake 
[02:15:00]  So much  So he was getting oxygen  But a very  Very minimal amount  Huh  You think he was lightheaded  When they landed  Oh  Wow  A little woozy  How did he not fall out  When the wheel came down  Oh yeah  There's a ledge  For you to sit on up there  Oh is there  I would imagine  If you're going into a wheel well  You're going to figure out  How to like  Make sure you're alright  When all that shit's going on  Depends on the plane  But there's a lot of shit in there  So there's like  The bottom of the plane  Where you would sit there  And the wheel comes up 
[02:15:30]  In front of you  It doesn't squish you  It has  It's fucked up  Some people that have been squished  And then they fall out  When the plane goes to land  And some mangled body  Hits somebody's roof  Why didn't he save up  Miles for a ticket  Yeah exactly  Like the rest of us  What's wrong with this guy  He was running away  He had a fight with his folks  Yeah  He had a fight with his folks  His folks  How do you fucking not know  That it's going to be  50 below zero  And no air 
[02:16:00]  But he landed  And he was walking around the tarmac  And they questioned him  And that's how they got him  Crazy ass  Did he really have a heart attack  On descent  That's what they were saying  That's going to suck  Yeah  They were amazed  At his condition  Think they flew home  Wait his condition  What's that song  Condition  Dead stock cards yelling down the hall  I'm sure  The condition I'm in  The condition of my condition  The condition  The condition of the condition I'm in  Yeah  Somebody's got it 
[02:16:30]  Someone's got it here  First edition  No  My condition of my condition  The condition of the condition  I'm in  I'm going with two conditions  I don't know  By the way  Most religions  Acknowledge normal  Evolutions  Only the fundamentalists  Yeah  These guys are saying  You can't shit out all the Catholicism  For that  Okay  That's why we ask these questions  And I said that  Of course  We're not saying it  So the Pope could acknowledge  Openly  You know  That evolution  Existed 
[02:17:00]  What was the condition  My condition was in  Yes  But there was two conditions in there  Thank you Mike  David Duncan said  Many religious people  Also claimed that  God buried  Fake dinosaur bones  Just to test their faith  He did  If you believe that one  You're a horse's patoot  He actually  After he put the dirt back on him  He went  Tee hee hee  Yeah  And tiptoed away  And now in China  There's a giant ladder  Back to heaven  I'm an idiot  You're never going to win a debate 
[02:17:30]  If that's  No  Some of the things they believe  How  And then  The only thing you have  To back it up  Is say well  Scott  All sorts of knowledge  And they go well  He buried them  He buried it  Fake ones  To test our faith  How do you come back  From that in a debate  No he didn't  Saying God buried his bone  Buried the bone  Buried his bone  Don't ask me to help you  You weren't very helpful  On my  Please  On my weathervane  Joke  You could have assisted  You made it a charmer  No I didn't  Like bashing my head 
[02:18:00]  With a shovel  Joe in Ohio  Joe  Hey man  Yeah the other night  On Cosmos  They were actually  Talking about  How they figured out  The age of the earth  Quote unquote  In the bible  Oh  Found a calendar  Exactly  Yeah  But it was based off  Of  Somebody that died  And they knew  The date that he died  And somebody just went back  And counted up  The generations of people  In the bible  Back to Adam and Eve  And that's how  They came up with it  They said  It's never been mentioned 
[02:18:30]  In the bible  How old the earth is  So  Alright  This is a contradiction  And they were really  Talking about  You know  6,000 years  Is what  You know  Quote unquote  What Christians believe  And then the actual earth  Is 4.5 billion years  They're off by a lot  They're off  If they said  4.3 billion  And science said  4.5 billion  I'd say they're in the ballpark  Right  Right  Yeah  Science is 4.8  They say 6,000  They're fools  Big difference  Yeah  Alright sir  Thank you 
[02:19:00]  Alright thank you  Let's go to Keith in Philly  Keith  Hey what's going on guys  Hey buddy  Hey  Yeah Bill Nye  Recently debated  One of the creationist scientists  Yes we saw that  And the guy  Went with the 6,000 year old thing  And the next day  Someone was interviewing  Pat Robertson  Who's like extreme  As you could get  And even Pat Robertson  Was like  You know  We gotta cut out this bullshit  Because it's really  Making us look bad  Oh good for him  Pat Robertson  Although I hate his guts  Wow  Yeah and just  I'm gonna show you  How dumb people are  During the middle of the debate 
[02:19:30]  This woman said to Bill Nye  She goes  How do you explain  The sunset  If there's no God  And just that question alone  He broke it down  And explained  You know  How the earth moves  And  Under my feet  It goes  Yeah  It goes back to that thing  Where you can explain it  And people just go  Nah  I was God  But the idea  That somebody would use that  How do you explain  The sunset  If there's no God  Oh well  I've never seen anything  Prove God less  Than us getting colder at night  Yeah 
[02:20:00]  Yeah  Yeah  And the natural occurrence  Of the earth spinning  And the sun going to the other side  It's ridiculous  You mean God  You mean the one thing  That does give us life  When it disappears  That's evidence of God  You shitheads  Yeah  It's like the way people thought  You know  The first people thought  You know  10,000 years ago  That's  You know  That's how they believed  They explained everything  You know  I would say  How can you deny  The existence of God  When you're getting blown  And a girl is working 
[02:20:30]  A small dildo  Into your asshole  And you realize  Wow  I can come this way  There's no other explanation  To me  That was the Lord at work  Showing me  That I'm on the right track  She was doing God's work  Prove to me  That I will not always  Make a duty  When that happens  That's wonderful  Thank you Christ  Why is Danny losing his mind  Back there  Apparently you guys  Are not broadcasters  Because broadcasters  We would have known that 
[02:21:00]  Of course  Condition that my condition  Is in  We ask  Who did that song originally  I don't know  Who did that song  Yes  It was  First edition  First edition  He has a problem  With what we're doing  And not knowing something  And he's actually harping on it  It's pitching  Pitching a fit  You don't like that? 
[02:21:30]  Ew I hate it  I should get over it  I should get over it  But I can't  You have to  Pitching a fit  He actually looked at the paper  Writing that song  And said yep  That's the one I'm using  Yeah whining and crying  And pitching a fit  Pitching a fit  I don't think it's worse  Than an older gentleman  Trying to write young person lyrics  It's got to rhyme  With get over it  So pitching a fit  You could have said clit  You could have said  So many things  This song's a piece of shit  A gun in my mouth  Would fit  It's a big song for them 
[02:22:00]  This song sucks  In more than just a bit  It's just like Desperado  Oh exactly  Big hit  Big hit  Oh boy  The guy wants in  On the religious debate  We're not debating  Religion right now  Thank you Jerry  We're trying to move on  Dave go ahead  Yeah we know  Black girl believes  The earth is 6,000 years old  Yeah  That makes him stupid  Crazy  Go ahead Dave  How you doing  Basically this is where  People go wrong  With the whole religion thing  Basically these 
[02:22:30]  Hardcore Christians  I mean it's ridiculous  Like I'm Catholic  Born and bred  But they're basically  A series of guidelines  Where okay  This is how to live  To be a better person  And if you look  At any other religions  They kind of all  Bring to the same thing  But there's no need  To dismiss  Scientific facts  Because you believe  In something that  Gives you comfort  That's where these guys  Are going  Absolutely wrong  And the only debate  That they can actually  Put forth for an argument 
[02:23:00]  That makes sense  For the defense of God  Is the fact that  The people that  Don't believe in him  Can't prove that  He doesn't exist  So you know  Why I believe in God  Have you ever seen  A sparrow  Flutter around  A flower  How do you deny God  When a sparrow  Is fluttering  Fluttering his beauty  I'll tell you  How do you deny God  When you walk up  With a zim-zam paddle  And you swat that sparrow  Into the sidewalk  Yeah yeah 
[02:23:30]  I know  It can't be disproven  But it's so ridiculous  That you shouldn't have to  I don't know  Oh no I completely agree  I mean I just  I just believe  It's a set of rules  To help people  Live better  I mean if you look at  I get you  We got it  But some people  Don't think of it  That way  They think of it  Very literally  What would be  The other things  That were better  Like that you'll be  Smitten  If you do this wrong  Or if you deny  Thy mother and father 
[02:24:00]  That thou shalt be smitten  Yeah he will smite  I mean I think  The best way to do it  Is just to live  The golden rule  You know treat people  The way you want to treat it  And call it a day  Golden rule like Bill Devane  He lives by the golden rule  Exactly  You're safe  I shower by that rule  Yes  It's like I get pissed off  The golden shower rule  Jimmy  Okay boys  I'm punching out  Alright  Thank you buddy  We're going to take a break 
[02:24:30]  Alright  And move on to other things  Sure  What was that  What  What happened  I don't know  I don't know  I keep looking at  This Fox  Morning show  Right  And  There's just nothing  Going on in it  I keep looking like  Oh maybe that's something  That's interesting  No  No  God  They're wacky  They are  They try to be too  Zanerific  They do wacky stuff

Oh, this sounds like  With every move she makes  I told her, you know, on a jagged sky  I just wanted to see what condition my condition was in  Alright, that's all 
[02:39:00]  We're trying to remember that line  Yeah  My condition was in  That was like Secret Agent Man  Secret Agent Man  Yeah  E-Rock sent a little gift to Scott Shannon  From the show  Oh, yeah?  And Scott Shannon received the gift  Jimmy?  No  You look cheeky  I know I do, but I didn't  You didn't fart?  No  And, you know

Well, Scott Shannon thinks we sent him a gift  I had no idea that we sent him a gift  I didn't either  Until E-Rock told us that he sent a gift on behalf of the show  Yeah  I know, I can't stop looking at my fat stomach  Jesus  I had a shitty day beating on Easter 
[02:40:00]  To have treats?  Fuck  It's hard, man  It's hard  It's so hard  We did blow off dessert, though  After the Tyson dinner  We didn't stay for dessert  Yeah, when I went to Bob Kelly's to watch Game of Thorns  I didn't blow off those cookies  Game of Thorns  Thorns  I always say that  I always say Game of Thorns  Game of Thorns  Chip says that to be annoying  Game of Thorns  Yeah, Game of Thorns  You want to watch Game of Thorns  Ugh  But I always say that like now  This is staggering 
[02:40:30]  Was this watch broken?  Two hours and eight minutes and 37 seconds?  Did you have a moped through some of that?  You know, I did the Boston Marathon  This was my third time  I was third  Oh, okay, he's American  I played since 2010  After I won New York  But this time  Third time was a charm  And I always believed I could run fast  I just never had the opportunity to run beyond a fast course  And yesterday  If I couldn't win it  I want to be on the podium  If I can't be on the podium  It's like Mariano Rivera a little bit  Yes, if I run the best that I can to give to the city  That's all I could ask for 
[02:41:00]  You think Baruch Tetley  Yes, him too  All of the three happened  I won, I ran the personal best  And I couldn't be happier  And it's two  Sounds a bit French, no?  Everything happens in God's time  Because, you know, what happened last year  I don't know  How devastating it was  I guess it was American  An American win it  And on the spotlight  And to be able to give a little life  To the city and the United States and the world  It's just amazing  Very nice  Matt, when you raised your hands in celebration  Victory  It was a victory for freedom  Congratulations  Oh, my God  Damn it  Ew  Straight ahead and run down the bar 
[02:41:30]  Ew  How fucking embarrassing  It wasn't a victory for freedom  It was, Jimmy  Enough with the word freedom  I love that word  I love freedom  But enough yapping about it  When you see a country that has it  Please let me know  Victory  Freedom, my ass  That's that word  It's kind of  Overused  It's a joke at this point  In this country  It is  Freedom  But you don't think that was a victory for freedom? 
[02:42:00]  Look, granted  There's worse places to live  I'll acknowledge that  But  Stop at the freedom  Oh, the other one was like  Yesterday  I saw them interviewing  That guy  The winner  And it was Fox News  And the anchor  Was it Bill Hemmer  Or something was there  And he goes  He goes  You know  There are 38,000 other winners here today though  He says it right to him  It's like  No  I won  Of course  Why wouldn't he say  And he's like  Yes, yes  You know 
[02:42:30]  After the events of last year  I think everybody that ran  Is the winner  No  Wrong  Wrong  Wrong  Wrong  Mr. Hemmer  Yes  He talked to Mr. Nails too  It was a very  It was a very emotional day for Boston  It was a nice day for Boston  Right?  I guess  But  Let's not overthink it  I love how they put all  They like  Doubled the amount of cops  On the course  Oh yeah, they did  You know what's fucked up though  It's like  Look who did this  It was like  Two of these 
[02:43:00]  Dopes  That fucking did that  It's not like  It's a  Recurring problem  I think they got a little  Carried away  But you know  If something did happen  And they didn't have  Twice the amount of cops  Then there'd be a problem  Of course  But I mean really  People would go with the fudge  They always do shit like that though  They close the old barn door  After the horses got out  Well Boston proved  They're very strong though  Yes they did  Boston is strong  Jersey not so much  New York wouldn't be as strong  Maybe Jersey  Because the hurricane  Well Jersey is what 
[02:43:30]  Well I saw people from Jersey  Come together  And they got through that  Because Jerseyans  Get through  What are they doing  As only New Jerseyans could  Right  Is that the line  You know  But that's what  Boston's all about  Boston's a city  Where adversity comes around  You're going to see  These people  Getting together  Because that's what  Boston does  That's what Boston does  But every other city  Eh not so much  They would fold  They would fold  You know  9-11 though  New York  We saw 
[02:44:00]  Right  Why do we do that  To ourselves  Wasn't Jersey stronger  Than the storm  Right  Uh huh  And other cities  Wouldn't have been  Stronger than the storm  Yeah  They would have just  Sat there  Fucking you know  Shitting themselves  And crying  And never rebuilding  Anything  Wouldn't it be great  If they actually came out  To something negative  Like a bunch of people  In Oklahoma died  In a tornado  So the tornado came  We hid in the cellars  And died  Because that's what  Oklahomans do  And the survivors  Came out  And just wept 
[02:44:30]  In their own filth  Look  It's a nice story  Up in Boston  Of course  I love Boston  But I hate  When we do that  With our cities  And every city  Does it  Like they're special  Or their state  Is more special  Than other states  I've never seen  A city come together  Like I did  This week  When  Insert city name here  Right  Insert state here  That's all we're saying  But I'm sure  It was a great day  In Boston  And some tears  Were shed  It was good  But  I don't know 
[02:45:00]  Yeah  They  Stupid  Governor Christie  Does it the worst  Worse than anyone  Trying to say  That New Jersey  Is the greatest state  And the people  The greatest people  It is  It's just nonsense  Right  Let me say hi  To John in Jersey  John  Good morning boys  Good morning  I just want to let you know  That we here in New Jersey  Are stronger than the storm  Ah there it is  See  Oh right  Right  Stronger than the storm 
[02:45:30]  Alright  Let's say hi to Bill  In Pennsylvania  Hello Bill  Hey  Hey  I got pulled over  By the state police  With that choking dog  And the razor  And stuff  I was laughing so hard  I was tearing up  You almost had me  Do a sobriety test  And telling you  You heard it  And felt  And he was laughing  Could that be  This week's nugget  Or did we  Use that as  A nugget already  Sam Roberts  Oh  The Jim Brewer

[02:49:00]  Another successful funny phone scam  Right there  Yeah  At 8.05 in 22 seconds  We'll be doing the same bit  I'm reinventing radio  Kill myself  Cock  Cock  Anyway  We got an ice trucker  In trouble  Ice trucker  And it's really strange  Because we did a production piece 
[02:49:30]  When the other ice trucker  Ice road trucker was in  Yeah he was funny  But a little creepy  And he added that creepy laugh  Yeah  Can we play that production piece  Before the story  The news story  So we made this after  One of the ice road truckers  Came in  On the ice roads of Alaska  Oh hey man  Thank you so much  For picking me up  If someone  Is playing a deadly game  I gotta tell you man  Most people wouldn't have stopped 
[02:50:00]  For a stranger  The good lord  Puts different things  In one's path  Every day  What?  There's always things  Happening around me  Ever since those young  Not good things  You know  Oh I'm scared  A lot  I'm scared  I'm scared of the dark too  But I go out there  Prepare  For the thrill ride  Of a lifetime  40,000 Americans a year  Die on the highways  Of America  The trucker 
[02:50:30]  I'm the funniest guy  I know  Was that him?  That's eerie  That's the same guy  Who did the  Deep voice  I did  I think that was probably  Mitch  That's pretty good  Our production guy  He's got that fucking  Yeah like  His delivery there  So Ice Road Trucker  Kidnapped Hooker  Good boy  Ice Road Trucker  Deadliest Road Star  Tim  Zick 
[02:51:00]  Zicker  Zicker  Ticker  Tim Zicker I guess  Has defied death  On the road  But he might have  A hard time  Steering clear  Of three  Unbelievable  Validates  Hilarious  Zicker  Is being charged  With first degree  Kidnapping  Extortion  And coercion  He looks bizarre  All stemming  From an incident  With a prostitute  Named Snow White  TNZ reports  Snow White  The police report  Obtained by TMZ  States  Zicker hired the prostitute  On December 18th 
[02:51:30]  2013  She claims that  Zicker gave her  His debit card  And instructed her  To withdraw her fee  Wow  But later accused her  Of taking out  An extra thousand dollars  Bitch  The next day  The next day  Zicker allegedly  Arranged a meeting  With Snow White  To settle their  Financial dispute  He reportedly  Attacked her  Punching her  In the face  And threatening  To kill her  If she failed  To return  The stolen funds  When's the crime  Happen  Do you really believe  That he said  Here's my debit card  Go get yourself  Some money  You give a hooker  Your debit card 
[02:52:00]  And then  Yeah  Just take out  What  No no  That's ridiculous  Come on  Snow White  Claims that  Zicker tied her up  Using backpack straps  Continued to beat her  And poured cold water  On her  From a mop bucket  Before locking her  In a closet  And demanding  A phone number  For someone  Who could get him  His money  Instead the crafty  Hooker gave Zicker  A number of a  Police officer  That's smart  That's a good one  Zicker called  The police officer  And arranged a meeting  But before leaving  To collect his cash 
[02:52:30]  Zicker forced Snow White  Out of his apartment  Via a second story window  Threw her out the window  Upon meeting the officer  Zicker apparently admitted  To the entire ordeal  Oh there you go  One of the ice rug  Wow  In deep trouble  He looks scary man  So you gotta just  Take the hit on that one  Even though it sucks  You know  If you get  Because of stuff like this  A thousand bucks  For him  That's a lot of money  That's probably a lot  Of fucking money  Right  Well don't give a 
[02:53:00]  Fucking hooker  Your debit card  Exactly  You think she might  Have stole it though  Yeah  I mean how'd you  Get his pen though  Why didn't he say  Yeah exactly  Okay  What a dummy  He was probably  All fucked out  Drunk  Just sitting there  Like ah  You go  I want my money  Yeah here  Just take  Just take out  Probably  Terrible impression  Yeah  He actually sounds  Exactly like him  Let's go to  Tony in Cleveland  Tony  Hey yeah  Hey oh hey yeah 
[02:53:30]  Hey you know  Boston had their  Little problem  Last year  And they were  Boston strong  And New Jersey  Gets hit by a storm  They're stronger  Than a storm  Katrina hits New Orleans  What was their theory  Ah fuck it  Pretty much  Pretty much  They just didn't know  How to figure that out  The government didn't  Come in  Swoop in  To help  See they needed  A snappy motto  They would have  Came back  They rebuilt  Quite well  So that's our point  Thank god for that  Mayor Nagin guy  No I don't know 
[02:54:00]  Ant he was not  Very helpful  Oh that's right  He's  Well they got  Passed that  He got convicted  Of misappropriations  Of certain funds  Ray  Was that Ray  Extortion  Ray Nagin  Yeah Ray Nagin  Ray Nagel  It was a little  Roadblock for the city  But they got  Passed all that  Yeah  The point is  You know  When horrible shit  Goes wrong  People  That's what brings  People together  Brings them together  They were so poor  And so black  We remember 
[02:54:30]  And Detroit  They don't give a fuck  Either  Detroit might be  The only city  That just  Is saying  Fuck it  They might be  The only one  You know  Detroit is a city  Where the  Alright  I can't even  Fake it  Everyone just  Said fuck it  There's no  Strength here  What is  What is  Their motto  Fuck it  I used to drive  To Detroit  Five days a week  And that is  Some of the  Scarier  I've driven  All 48 states  And there's  No place  Scarier than  Detroit  I swear  I want a tour 
[02:55:00]  Of Detroit  So badly  But you know  It would have  To be with  Like you know  Armed  Armed  With the cops  And stuff  Cause  Yes  I could show  You some areas  In Detroit  Without Kenny  I don't think  You'd go  Dude  I have  YouTube  When I'm bored  I just watch  Detroit videos  On YouTube  Yeah  With the urban  Decay and stuff  It's amazing  Absolutely amazing  You hear about  The  Thanks Tony  The shenanigans  In Chicago  Over the weekend  No that's more you 
[02:55:30]  40 people  Shot  Really  40  40 people  Shot  In Chicago  Five of them  Children  They need gun laws  I guess it's the  Gun laws  Oh that's right  They have them  Now it's  And I guess the  Feds are stepping in  In some way  Shape or form  They're going to  Start using some  Type of  Federal statutes  To try to  Quell the violence  But that won't  Work either  Nothing works  It's a  It's just  Conditioning  It's  It's a culture  It's something 
[02:56:00]  That needs to be  Done on a  Very much  Deeper level  Than just  The  Trying to  Enforce these  Laws  But yeah  Oh 45  People  I guess was  The final number  Over Easter  Weekend  45 people  Shot  And yeah  Five of them  Just kids  In a park  And it was  Obviously over  You know  Drugs  And these  Idiots don't  Even know how  To shoot their  Dumb guns  And they  Wind up  Hitting kids  Where's the  Where's the  Media outrage 
[02:56:30]  Like the  Zerman trial  Could you imagine  If there were  40 people  Shot  Let's take it  Not individual  Shootings  One guy  Goes into  Somewhere  Shoots 45  People  Including five  Children  And  It would be  Outrage  Because the press  Does not care about  Black lives  They only care about  White behavior  Right  They don't care  They really  That should prove to you  They don't give a shit  How many black people  Get killed  They don't  Don't even care  But they'll give a shit  If white people 
[02:57:00]  Talk about it  Yeah  And make it sound  Like you know  A problem  I don't know  I don't know  But that's your  How many dead  Chicago report  I don't know  How many died  Did any die  Eight  Eight dead  Eight out of 45  No  Eight plus  44  Oh so it's  Eight dead  44  Wounded  Oh wow  That's pretty fucking  Intense  152  Total people  They gotta get  Their average up  Those fucking  Numbers are  Pathetic  Jesus Christ 
[02:57:30]  If I went to the range  And fired 45  Fucking shots  And only got  Eight center mass  Fucking take my  Gun away  Crazy  Well maybe the feds  Will be able to go  In there  And tiptoe around  All types of  Political correctness  And still fix the problem  Good luck to you  Good luck there  Chicago  Chicago  Let's go to  Ben in Toronto  Toronto  Ben  Hey 
[02:58:00]  I'm from Toronto  But I'm in Buffalo  Right now  I don't care why  Hopi  You definitely gotta  Go through Detroit  That's probably  The scariest city  In the world  It's unbelievable  It's almost like  Being out in the  Middle East  Somewhere  It looks like  Bombs have gone off  Have you ever been  To the Middle East  Sir  I've seen pictures  Like you've seen  Pictures of Detroit  It's terrible though  Right  Yeah I would love  To do that  We were up there  Once for our  Virus tour  Yeah  But we like  We didn't get to  See anything  No we stayed 
[02:58:30]  In the compound  We didn't venture out  We're in the middle  Of nowhere  Yeah we were  Even right downtown  I've been driving  By houses that are  On fire in these  Neighborhoods  There ain't nobody  Coming to put them out  It's just crazy  The city's so broke  The highways are dirty  It's scary  It's like it doesn't  Even  It isn't even  Part of the  United States anymore  Well no I heard  Somewhere  And I don't think  This is true  As I'll hear  Say from other  Truckers  Who don't know  Their ass  From a hole  In the ground  Oh boy  Where do they have  Their friends  Put their dicks 
[02:59:00]  They should just  Grow pot  Everywhere up there  Your bank  That would help  That would help  What are you saying  Though sir  You were starting  To say something  You have some  Friends  Drive through there  No no no  You know there's  People that were  Saying that they  Were trying to sell  Detroit to Canada  Like just give it  To Windsor  Oh there you go  That'd work  According to  Michael Moore  You guys would have  It whipped into shape  In no time 
[02:59:30]  No crime  No nothing  You need  The only way to  Turn around Detroit  They need major  Industry to move in  And that's just  Not going to happen  Nobody wants to move in  Because it's the scariest  Fucking city in the country  So how  How are they going  To turn that around  I guess  Maybe over  Many many years  You got to get rid  Of all the  Are we on the air  Yeah  I'll wait  It's another one  Of these cities  That have been  Wrapped by corruption  And poor  Mismanaged  Funds 
[03:00:00]  And  A democratic  Leadership  That  Just let the place  Fall apart  It's like  You know  Look at the way  New York City looked  Years before Giuliani  When a lot of  Your democratic mayors  Were in office  It was terrible  You know  You look at  What the Bronx  Used to look like  All those  Shit holes  But the economy  Was also horrendous too  Well the New York economy  Was even worse  Than the country's economy  Yeah  But it played into it  But there was  The thing is 
[03:00:30]  It was  A bad element  And I'm talking  Everything  The porn fucking  Places  The stores  And shops  In Times Square  That just kept  A bad element  Coming in  You know  It took  Giuliani  To come in  And really say  No  Get the squeegee  Guys off  Get fucking  Real businesses  In here  Let's pump  Money into  What's going to  Make money  For the city  And it did  That was really  Brilliant on his  By Giuliani 
[03:01:00]  To turn Times Square  Around like that  Yeah  That's like the pinnacle  But that's all  Taurus now  Yeah  They flood to  Times Square  Yeah  Huge  To hang out  With other tourists  I'll say it again  If you come to  New York City  There's so many  Cool places to go  Why would you  Why would you  Sit your ass  In the middle  Of Times Square  For two or three days  For a long weekend  There's  There's nothing there  Except other tourists  Yeah  And us  Because we  Work a block  From Times Square  Basically  Huh  There's a big TV  In Times Square 
[03:01:30]  You can watch  Oh there you go  Go to  Go to  Soho  Go to  Little Italy  Go to  Chinatown  Go to  Central Park  They're scared  Go to  Union Square  And people watch  Yeah  Bryant Park  There's a million  Places to go  And they all  Just go to  Times Square  And walk around  I've seen other  Parts of New York  And then Jersey  I usually drive  Into Jersey  The port in Jersey  I pick up cars  In the port  And bring them back  To Canada  Same port  Right  But for Giuliani  To have the vision  That he could  Turn this around 
[03:02:00]  This Times Square  You have to  Spend money  That's going to  Make money  For a city  It's ridiculous  To think  You could  Shovel out  A bunch of  Fucking money  On programs  And projects  That don't  Pay back  More than you  Put into it  And that's what  Happened in New York City  And that's the reason  All those buildings  In the Bronx  Got knocked the fuck down  They started building  Other establishments  That made money  But how they can  Do that in Detroit  Is my point  Well that's just it  You have to 
[03:02:30]  You have to  Start from the bottom up  You gotta get  An administration  In there that  Understands the problem  First of all  And then start  Fucking  Working accordingly  I don't know  How it's done  But I know  That letting it  Rot away  And just trying  To keep the bottom  From blowing out  With funds  To things that  Don't make money  That doesn't do it  They don't even  Have city bosses  I think at this point  It's a disaster  I think they have  City buses  But you're right  It's rotting away  I think the cops  Have to take the buses 
[03:03:00]  Or something  Something  I don't know  They have to drive  Buses around  I'm fascinated by Detroit  What's going on  It's fantastically depressing  And someone's gotta make  A real solid documentary  On it  Yeah  You get little  You get little pieces  Here and there  On YouTube  And other shows  Like Anthony Bourdain  Did a great episode  Of his show  Out of Detroit  But you know  It's based on food  I'm doing a documentary  In Detroit  It's called Detroit  Colon  The Wonder Years  Oh  It's all about  The auto industry  Did you know  The auto industry 
[03:03:30]  Used to be big there  We didn't know  Alright sir  Thank you buddy  Thanks man  Thanks for the phone call  Lindsay Lohan  Finished her reality show  Sam  Yes  It was the finale  I watched one episode  And I couldn't be bothered  By this dumb  I didn't even watch one  This dumb thing  I should have missed  Carriage  It was one of the  All time worst  It really was  Reality shows go  Because she's lying  To everybody  Even Oprah  And Oprah's trying to  Oprah  Oprah  Hang in there  And she's trying  To believe Lindsay Lohan  But Lindsay Lohan 
[03:04:00]  Plays everybody  Around her  It's boring  It's just a boring  Boring show  Right  So what happened  On the season finale  This is just like  Lindsay talking  To the camera  About how far  She's come  And how good  She is  And some of the  Things that the  Reality show  Did to her  Oprah paid  A lot of money  For this  And it was a bust  It was part of the deal  She got the interview  With Lindsay  And then the reality show  And blah blah blah  But then Lindsay Lohan  Would just take off 
[03:04:30]  Without the camera crew  For a couple weeks  Go to LA  Well she explains  In the clip  Exactly why  That she was so naughty  She was not able  To be filmed  For a couple weeks  She's an incredible liar  She oh absolutely  Well my humble opinion  Is still using  It strikes me  As watching it  In my opinion  As addict behavior  Kind of stereotypical  Addict behavior  Yeah  I may have  Addictions  To certain things  In life  But I'm not  Essentially your  Typical addict  That's not who I am  I'm not that kind of person 
[03:05:00]  I know the difference  Between right and wrong  And stupid  And idiotic  And you know  What's good and bad  Like I know that  I was raised well  By my parents  But  And I've seen it  But there's certain things  That people don't  And there's no one  Around people sometimes  And I see that now  Shut up  She's whining  Tunting  Enough of her  But then sometimes  I'm like  Yeah  You made your bed 
[03:05:30]  Now fuck everyone in it  Jesus  Now you gotta deal  With Michael Rohan  Fuck him  It gets back to him  And then he  He threatened Jimmy last time  He was none too pleased  With my criticism  Well her  His fucking actions  Through her life  Have just done  Wonders for her  I don't think so  Oh I don't either  Let me go to Chicago  And talk to Jeff  About this situation  At hand  Hey  Hey how's it going there  Oh

[03:06:30]  On YouTube  I mean  I think it'll be under  Oprah Reed  The Ride Act  Or Oprah  Who's that  Yeah  Oprah Reed  The point is  The point is  You can actually  You can actually read  Some of the Riot Act  Yes  Where do you find a copy  Of the Riot Act  I co-authored the Riot Act  Oh  Yes  If you need to read  Some of the Riot Act  Where do you get a copy  Yeah where do you get  The Riot Act  I don't know  I don't know  Because you're always trying  To read some of the Riot Act  And I've never found it  I can't memorize all that  I need to read it 
[03:07:00]  You were saying  Some of the Riot Act  I hate it  Maybe quiet  Ryan has the Riot Act  Oh thank you for wrecking everything  Oh fucking  Boo  Ryan  More Lindsay Lohan  Thanks  Now I'm in a place  Where I've learned it  And I know little things  That I can do  And people that I  Could surround myself with  Or not be with  I blocked so many people  On my phone  Oh good  I went for the Shaman  For  I did a cleanse  The Shaman  These are crazy  I did a really eye-opening  Experience of Ayahuasca  It was really intense  And I saw my whole life  In front of me 
[03:07:30]  And I had to let go  Of past things  That I was trying  To hold on to  That were dark in my life  And physically  I felt it  When I had this experience  Like I saw myself die  It was insane  I saw myself being born  And that  I feel different  Ever since that  Just being okay  With  You know  I saw myself being conceived  And letting that go  And still fresh  From the back  This bitch is nuts  She's talking about  Trying to slap her life together 
[03:08:00]  By deleting people  From her phone  And going to a shaman  That's right  I was a shaman  On EverQuest  How did it work out for you?  It was pretty good  Nice  I would tank sometimes  And be able to cast spells  It was pretty good  I was a shaman  In real life  Yeah?  Cast spells  You weren't  Things of that nature  Things of that nature  She's a fucking idiot  I like how she says  She knows the difference  She's like  I know the difference  Between right and wrong 
[03:08:30]  I know the difference  Between stupid and idiotic  Right  Stupid and idiotic  What is the difference  Between stupid and idiotic?  Let's say hi to Bill Doe  What's up Bill Doe?  What's going on guys?  How are you Bill Doe?  Pretty good man  I was just wanting to  You know  Raise awareness  To the fact that  If you're delivering in Detroit  You'll notice that  All the street signs  Are taken down  In the industrial parts  So they can get  These truckers lost  And what they'll do is  You know  You'll pull over 
[03:09:00]  And try to call somebody  To figure out  Where the hell you are  And they'll  They'll come up to your window  And you know  Try to rob you  It's happened to me  Two or three times  But I just leave  In the window rolled up  And keep moving  Well then why are you  Getting off the highway  After the first time  Use GPS  No no no  You have to like  Pick up in Detroit  Or deliver you know  You don't want to  You have to  Yeah I think your story  Is a flat out lie  Oh shit  Oh bullshit  Bullshit  Jimmy said it  Why aren't you using GPS  You don't need road signs 
[03:09:30]  Oh I've got GPS  But you don't want to  Trust them  Because I'll put you  On road  Oh god  You're just lying  Don't want to trust GPS  Hey the truckers  Know what I'm talking about  Oh boy  I think GPS  Is pretty accurate  And if you know  This type of thing  Is happening in Detroit  To break down  Your lie further  You would have to  Now depend on the GPS  You don't believe this story  Right  Not at all  Well  I asked for directions  Once to the highway  And the guy said  Fuck your mama  Do you believe this guy 
[03:10:00]  Actually cut off his own dick  Or do you think  That there's a reason  Why these guys  In the interview  Weren't answering questions  Because I've seen somebody  Cut off his dick  And thrown off the balcony  I think he really  Cut his dick off  And jumped off the balcony  They couldn't reattach it  By the way  Right  Have you not seen  Ace Ventura Pet Detectives  Nope  Nope  Never saw it  I saw a great  A great episode of Cops  I saw Short Circuit though  Oh that one sucked too 
[03:10:30]  Ace Ventura was such a big thing  I suppose  Oh me  They had this tractor trailer  And they parked it  In a very bad neighborhood  And they left the lock off  Of the back door  Whoa  And they opened it up  And there were boxes  Of VCRs  Back in the day  Right  Boxes of VCRs  Stacked in the back wall  Of the tractor trailer  And then up against the side  Was what looked to be  Boxes of other shit  Right  But it was actually  A wooden hinged wall 
[03:11:00]  That cops were behind  And when they'd run up  To get the VCRs  The cops would slam  This thing shut  And they'd be in there now  Stuck with the guy  That was trying to steal  The VCRs  It was so funny  The surprise they got  Where is this?  I don't know  But the guys were going  When they opened it up  They were going  VCRs  VCRs  It might have been LA  East LA  It's pretty good though  Were they bombed  At the cops  North LA  Oh were they bombed  They were trapped  Like rats  With the cops  Yeah with the cops 
[03:11:30]  And there was nowhere  They could go  Maybe North LA  I don't know  I'm gonna go with East LA  I think  Probably East LA right  Good  Although I think  All of LA  Is very Mexican  These days right  Not sure  Detropia  I've seen Detropia  Andrew  Yo Detropia  That's one of the  Fine documentaries  On Detroit  On YouTube  I've seen it  Well yeah  It was out in the theaters  It's unreasonable  Maybe a year or two ago  I was just saying  You guys were talking about it  And it was actually pretty good  It was very good 
[03:12:00]  Yeah  He's selling it  The demise of the city  That's all  Fair enough  I was just fucking with you  No worries  Yeah  Sorry to eat my ass  Nick in Ohio  Nick  Yeah how you doing Opie  Hey  And guys  Oh yes  Opie you sound very out of touch  When you say GPS is reliable  Fuck I don't want to be out of touch  Damn it  I drive a truck  As you can probably guess  And when you get close to your destination  You can't rely on GPS 
[03:12:30]  Because it could send you on a road  You don't belong  Or down  Especially in Detroit  Underpasses that are 12 feet  And you're 26  Oh  So  You can't  When you get close up  You usually gotta call  Ahead of time  Sign said  Clearance of 12 foot line  But the chickens  Were stacked to 13-9  We shot that tunnel  At 110  I don't know what that was  Alright  Well  I was wrong  I guess GPS is a little different  For truck drivers 
[03:13:00]  Yeah  For truckers  I mean  You can't just take any road  Right  I have to understand  Your point today  And you hung up  You hung up  Here's one more clip  From Lindsay Lohan  When a camera's on  I'm on  And if I can't  If I know I'm not capable  Of being on  That's why I would say  I couldn't film today  Not bad  And no one knows this  And we can finish after this  I had a miscarriage  For those two weeks  That I took off 
[03:13:30]  Uh oh  It's a very long story  But  I'm so sorry  That's why  On the show  When it says  She doesn't  I don't believe her  Oh man  Because everyone's talking about  Why were you gone  For two weeks in L.A.  And we weren't allowed  To film you  Yeah  She went into hiding  And it was probably  I'm thinking  Because she  You know  Yeah  Was telling everyone  She's not using anymore  And she was probably using  She probably spilt  A Bloody Mary  And uh  Right  Looked down and went  Oh  What'd I do  What'd I do 
[03:14:00]  But then  Get a doctor  But then if you say  I had a miscarriage  Then you get everyone  Back on your side  Right  You get everyone  Back together  Yeah  Because you would sound  Like a complete scumbag  To question that  Yes  Now you can't even question it  And addicts are very smart  In that way  What do you think  James  I think that  Oh  I get it  If you have a miscarriage  If it's a girl  If it's a boy  Is it a mister carriage  Don't  Shit  Go back  You want to come down  She doesn't want to come down 
[03:14:30]  I couldn't move  I was sick  And mentally  That messes with you  Does it  And watching this  I just know how I felt  Her womb was so polluted  And I can relate to that girl  Which sounds kind of crazy  But  I'm like  Oh my god  This is  This is really sad  Like who's helping her  And no one knows  What's going on in my head  At every second  Because I'm constantly thinking 
[03:15:00]  My mind does not shut off  Oh  Which is the only time it does  Is when I start doing meditation  Or I put music on  In my headphones  And  There was a lot going on  In my life  Yeah she's troubled  Oh  She's lying  A stew tomato  From a low hand  He would  He would do that good  So is she saying  She was going to have a baby there  Yes  I dropped the baby  On the kitchen floor 
[03:15:30]  She was going to have a baby  Sam  Yes she was pregnant  Do you believe her  No  From who  I don't  Because if she  Said she had an abortion  During that time  You could probably  Like look that up  Kind of  Yeah maybe it was  A surgical miscarriage  So to say  Miscarriage  That could happen anywhere  So you can't really prove that  She's a liar  No no  She's just  She's still  Addicted to all sorts of stuff  Maybe it went into the toilet bowl  And she was happy 
[03:16:00]  That it happened  Francine  Francine  I don't think I'll say  That's a joke about  Francine's miscarriage story  Is probably one  That we should play somewhere  That's just  Great  That it was a fantastic story  It's been a long time  Yeah  She's a classic  Rock and roll  Oh yeah  No no no  I wasn't thinking that  I just rock and rolled  I rock and roll all night  Miscarriage  She's  She's  In my opinion  Still using  She's not ready  To get clean  The me me me  Fucking shit  You'd have to deal with 
[03:16:30]  With her  They don't even have  Any idea who the father  Would potentially be  If the miscarriage story  Was true  Yeah  Jimmy Norton  Oh  That's not  That's not Jim  I didn't see the face  He had turned his head around  That's Lyle  I don't want to say nothing  Lyle Lohan  Lyle Lohan  Yeah  My kid  No it's not  You're a virgin  I heard on the podcast  Now they're saying  There's special GPS  For trucks  So am I right or wrong 
[03:17:00]  At this point  I don't know  I would guess  Can I be back to  Being right maybe  Right or wrong  I bet there would be  Something that a trucker  Could put in there  And say you know  Hey I'm a truck  Right  Give me the truck  Give me the truck  Give me the truck  Right  Exactly  Whatever  Let's say  How to White  Resin  Who's White  Resin  I'm me  I'm me  That's your name  What's going on guys  Hey White Resin  From Canada  Yeah it's me bud  That's just my twitter 
[03:17:30]  Named White Resin  But uh  Fair enough  I got a good  I found a good clip  Of you guys  Guys fucking  Running train  On you guys  Making fun  There's a show  Making fun of us  Yeah I got this  Yeah on satellite radio  Man  Fuck I had to go  Through so many  Of the boring ass  Podcasts  To find the clip  Whoa right  It's uh  Humble and Fred show  It's like  Humble and Fred  What  Yeah they're like  A four time  Fucking  Best morning  Bullshit show  What  I just thought 
[03:18:00]  It was so far  Off our radar  That like  Oh man  Fred  Never heard of them  Why are they  Obsessed about us  We don't even know you  No they just  Use you guys  As an example  Of the super  Unfunny  DJs  That made it  Ah I see  They reference  You guys  And what  They're jealous  That they haven't  Really made it  Who hears them  But  I mean they're like  Jim  Well  Well that's  That's that  Divine and Cocker  Thing  People  Love doing 
[03:18:30]  It has worked  In the past  Oh yeah  What's the clip though  Do you have it  I got it  Canadian phones suck  Slow down sir  You're panicking  Sorry man  I'm in the middle  Of nowhere  In a truck  Everyone's in a truck  Stop with the truck  I was just about  I got the clip  Alright we got the clip  You got the clip guys  I'll just sign out  But I had one more question  Yeah  It's for Jimmy  Go ahead sir  Hey where'd you get that  Jim  Where'd I get what  Shit it's not gonna work 
[03:19:00]  Alright peace guys  What  But he said it  I don't even know  What that means  He said where'd you get it  Jim  And then Jimmy  Didn't right away say it  How long is this clip  But then he did say it  You want to hear  Humble and Fred  Taking shots at  Well the YouTube clip  Is labeled appropriately  It says Humble and Fred  Take shots at  Superstars O.B. and Anthony  Cool  Cool  Wow  I don't know how  We're gonna handle this  I don't know who  Humble and Fred are  You're about to find out  How do they sound 
[03:19:30]  Like radio guys  That aren't used to that  Situation  Hey everybody having a good day  And when I hear that  It's like  Oh shut up  You're going to that already  What else  Hey having a good day  There's what they imagine  It to be like  Hey that's funny  Cause you know  We've often talked about  The way some people do  Morning shows  And I always say  We talk about that 
[03:20:00]  I'll say Blundell  I say here's the litmus test  You know you've got a bunch  Of people in a room  And they're laughing  And you know  They have these morning shows  Where they say these things  Everyone's laughing along  And you just know  That wasn't a joke  That was just a kind of a  Whatever a jocular moment  I always say the test is  If you take that  Out of the  If you took it out of the  Context of that morning show  And put it up on stage  Would it get a laugh  I say no  Whereas a lot of stuff  It's said  By Fred and Eileen  I guarantee you  It would be funny  But that's not  That's  That's not true  It doesn't have to be on stage 
[03:20:30]  And they just did  What they were talking about  They just started  They just started laughing  Instead of Fred and Eileen  That they would get a laugh  On stage  You fucking idiots  You just did exactly  What you're trashing  And also  What works on stage  And what works in a room  It's completely different  Yeah  Dynamics  Because the  There's little inside jokes  And just things that work  In a room  It would be like saying  That anybody  That was making people  People laugh at a party  Could then go up on stage  And use that material 
[03:21:00]  And make people laugh  They're totally different  His rule of thumb  Should be up his ass  See  Laugh  Go ahead  But then  It's not stage  But then they're laughing  At something that wasn't  Even close to being funny  I know  Fred and Eileen  Alright keep going  I guarantee you  It would be funny  When you repeated it  Later on that day  It just is  And that was always  That was always a bonus  Pardon?  That's a bonus  Because you know  There's a lot of  Successful radio stations  That aren't  That you can't take 
[03:21:30]  That material to the stage  And that's my point  That you oftentimes  I'll hear people  On these shows  And everyone's laughing  Abroiriously  And I'm thinking  Okay  Take that sentence  Put a premise  It's not getting that loud  And I think  What's happened over time  Is radio listeners  Have evolved  And they know that now  Before it used to be  A sense of fun  Remember that boss  We were talking  We were in New York  Listening to Opie  And Anthony  Our boss said  This famous line  Fred and I are going  Well these guys aren't funny  Well it's not about being funny 
[03:22:00]  It's about being fun  Well no we're funny  But they're not funny  And I'm just going to tell you  They're just  We  It's just not  Really funny humor  They got guys  In their show  That are funny  Jim Norton  Those guys are funny  Yeah Jim Norton  It's great  You know guys  Look guys have opinions  What's who's to say  I hear nothing but jealousy there  Whatever  How does it happen  That's kind of it  It fades out  And there's a photo  They're wrong about the way 
[03:22:30]  Humor translates to the stage  It's just not the way it works  There's been a million things  We laughed at in here  Yeah  Which were punch you  In the stomach  Funny that you cannot  Bring to the stage  You can't do  You can't react  Shining references  That rely on something  We did  Yeah  Like for instance  Somebody says something  Oh god what a whale  And then Ant goes  Oh E-Rock  That's funny because of the context of the show  I remember when Pryor did that  Exactly  You know you could  That huge laugh  E-Rock material  You could never bring that to a stage  Because there's no context of a callback 
[03:23:00]  From eight years ago  Or five years  It doesn't work that way  It's a different medium  And they say they're funny Sam  So why don't you just  Sam we should  Why don't you just  Why don't you listen to a random show of theirs  And let's see how funny  Humble and Fred are  Maybe we'll find some of the funniest moments for tomorrow  Humble and Fred  And they're whole  And they're whole  You know  They're not even trying to do radio different  They hired the stupid hole  Because someone told you to hire the stupid hole  So shut your fucking mouths  You're doing exactly what your PD is telling you what to do 
[03:23:30]  Because no guy wants to work with a fucking hole on the radio  Period  But you have no choice  Because you don't have any fucking balls  To say look I don't want the hole  Uh oh  What happened  What  I mean I just don't know if we want to mess with this show  Why  Only because  They have some really odd fans  Yeah  What do you mean by odd fans  Well I just mean I'm looking at  Let's go to their Facebook page  That's what I'm looking at  I'm looking at some of the things that their fans post on Facebook 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  And it's like  First of all  First of all  These are the guys  Are they lovers?  They're very close  Would you ever lean up against me in a publicity shot?  Well if I was holding my dick like that guy is  I'll be honest I would  Yeah  Yeah  Let's  Oh no  It's got a huge breast implant  Is that a boy in Hitlercock?  Hitlercock  The progeria kid  Your show gave me progeria  They do love that 
[03:24:30]  They find progeria funny  I guess  Why are their fans saying  This fucking show has AIDS?  Oh man  That's just mean  That is mean  These are all older  Yeah see  Their fans get ornery this morning  I wonder what's going on  Because a lot of the people are just posting  Get ready for a beating  Oh  I don't understand it  That's not funny  Why would their own fans threaten them?  That's not funny at all  I don't like that  Not funny  Not funny  Not funny  Remember that guy?  Not funny  Not funny  I remember him 
[03:25:00]  Whatever happened to him  I forgot his name even  Not funny  Patrice  Patrice  And Aunt Jemima  Just like Aunt Jemima  With a face on it  Why did AJ Poopy Shits  Post a picture of me and Ozzy  In our newspaper?  Aww  I first hit a press  I don't know  I didn't even know  AJ had Facebook  That is so weird  Isn't that weird?  You and Ozzy are on the same page like that  My first time ever  Have you told him?  They showed it to him  You did?  Yeah  He needed to go to sleep  You don't think it's an interesting story? 
[03:25:30]  God  No  But I said  You're playing the asteroids  Thank you Jim  Thank you Jim  Oh  One of the  Just reading some of their own  Sure  Updates on their Facebook page  They are funny  Yeah  It says  Today on the Humble and Fred show  The rain can't dampen our spirits  On this panel of women day  Panel of women day  And it's a rainy day  But their spirits are still high  Oh my god  What's the panel?  Wouldn't it be funny though  If they had a great name for it  It's called Cunt Thursdays 
[03:26:00]  That would get a laugh on stage  I wish  Would this get a laugh on stage?  Jim  You're the comedian  If it were Easter  And you wrote  After an egg-stra-long  Chocolate-fueled Easter weekend  The Humble and Fred show  Returns live tomorrow morning  Yes it would  But only if I was talking about ovulating  It's an egg-stra-long  Are you kidding me?  Egg-stra  If this is the kind of show they are  With a panel of women thing  And egg-stra  Of course they're not gonna 
[03:26:30]  This show's not for you  It's for real men  That laugh at tit jokes  And asses  That's right  There's a face and a fart  And you don't laugh  There's something wrong with you  I don't know  Alright let's move on  From Humble and Fred  They're too much for us  Let's say hi to David in Los Angeles  You've been humiliated  Yes I have  David  What's up?  Hey Opie  Lohan said she's not  A typical drug addict  But she said she took ayahuasca  Which is probably the most  Powerful psychedelic there is 
[03:27:00]  So she took a drug  To get over her drug habits  Well the shaman gave it to her  Well you're allowed to take  Some of those drugs  When you see a shaman  Yes  I guess  I don't know  She's just a liar  Pants on fire  I think she just continues to lie  Thank you David  Do you have the Oprah clip?  I do not have the Oprah clip  Alright it doesn't matter  I guess  We should take a break  Oprah  Bird is here  Bert is here  Right  Why are there pictures of me  With all my kiss people 
[03:27:30]  But it's Terry Schiavo  And everyone  That's not kissing  That's one of the photos  Of Terry Schiavo  That's kind of cool actually  Oh god  Stop it  Alright we're going to take a break  Get Bert in here next  And see some other things  What's the white supremacist story?  Well he was a tin knocker  And we got rabbits humping on a news desk  Oh yeah  Alright we got stuff to do still  And Bert Kreischer is going to join us next  Stay there

[03:39:30]  The Encore  Of the Opie and  Anthony Show  Gonna start at  11am on the east  8am for my homies  On the west  So if you miss  Any of this shit  And you wanna hear  It all again  Tune in  And check it out  The Opie and  Anthony Show  Is back  On Sirius XM  Got Bert Kreitzer  Outside the studio  Promoting his  Travel Channel show  I believe right  And also we gotta  Get into this  What is it  Duke University 
[03:40:00]  Yeah  Yeah  More absolutely  Irrelevant  Weak shit  By college students  Just the worst  Bert take a seat  How are you guys  How you doing  Good how are you  Doing alright  We're bitching  And complaining  About something  Yeah  We had yesterday  Off too  So this is like  Our Monday  Yeah yeah  It's the shit  You hear during  The weekend  You're like  I gotta talk  About that  People really  Want to hear me  Talk about it  Do you see  Things in the news  And kind of  Perk up  And go  Oh that's  On my radar  Yeah yeah 
[03:40:30]  That one  And then people  On twitter  Try to point  Things out  You really ought  To talk about  This on your show  That's why  I can never  Do fucking  Radio  Because I always  Whatever I  Perk up  Perks up  On my radar  I always have  The horrible  Opinion of  That I could  Never share  No but that's  A good thing  No that would  Be good  The horrible  Opinion is good  You'll probably  Get yourself  In trouble  James Winston  Yeah  STDs  James Winston  Oh yeah  Yeah  I believed  It was a train  Gone wrong  Really  Yep  And that was  My opinion  Very honestly  Because brothers  Were always in trains 
[03:41:00]  Uh huh  I've never been  In a train  That's not a  White guy thing  Have you ever  Been in a train  Jimmy  Well that's a  Bad guy to ask  I have  Yes  On the train  And the clean  Up committee  The clean  Up committee  Jesus  It's cream  Pie removal  Yes  So no but  That was my  Theory on the  James Winston  Thing  And you could  Never go on  Terrestrial radio  And say that  No not terrestrial  That is a  Bad place to be 
[03:41:30]  When you have  Opinions that  Most people  Don't agree with  Yeah  Cause you get  Fucked over  You would  You would  Be into this  Can you get  That up  So what  I hate that  Fuckin  And we got  This from  Twitter  Duke University  Has got  Another one of  Those campaigns  Where we got  Like words  It's like a  Worse  I knew  By the way  By the way  Once again  I'm sorry  To cut you off  Go ahead  I knew the  Duke rape thing  Was bullshit  Yeah  I knew it  The second it  Came out  I knew it  Was bullshit  That's right  White guys  Don't do that  No  But they don't 
[03:42:00]  Do that to  Black women  There is a  Power  I've been  In fraternity  Parties  When they have  A black stripper  As a power  Black women  Have  Over a group  Of white boys  They can get  Them to shut  The fuck up  In a second  Yeah the white  Guys are like  Okay  Yeah and it  Just I just  Believe when I  Saw that all  Go down  I was like  Nope  White boys  And I'm not  Saying I can't  Say 100%  But white boys  Only rape white  Women  Wow now that's  A thing you  Probably can't  Say on terrestrial  Radio  Or satellite  Probably  God damn it 
[03:42:30]  Alright it was  Good seeing you  Guys again  I'll see you  In two years  Burt Kreischer  Burt Kreischer made  It one day  With his radio  Show  But I've been  In those situations  As long as you  Don't say  You could say  White guys  Only  Just as long as  You don't say  Should always  Right right  Should always  I think if you  Looked at crime  Stats you would  Probably see that  White men  Predominantly are  Raping white women  I think you could  I think you could  Say that  Sure  As long as you  Got the stats  To  It's stats  You know  Back up  There is stats  But let's get  To this Duke  Thing  It's a campaign  That's 
[03:43:00]  It's a  You don't say  Duke  And it's more  This words hurt  Crap  And it's all  A lot of sayings  That we've all  Used  We've all used  Them  No matter who  You are by the way  Yes  What's this first one  And they  They have  The bad thing  To say  And then the  Reason they  Don't say it  Right  And I guess  They want the whole  Country to follow suit  And a bunch of  Papers are picking up  On this campaign  By Duke University  The first one is  I don't say  No homo  No homo  For the record  Yeah 
[03:43:30]  I learned that term  On this show  Yeah  Yeah  I think Danny  Was the one  That brought it in  Really  Yeah  I remember hearing it  I'd never heard it before  And I've heard it a ton  Wow  I feel like we  Were one of the first  In mainstream media  To use it  But who knows  Well usually there was  A comma after no  Sam  We were answering  A question  Sam would like  To think it was  Some kind of  Black rap artist  But I don't  I think we're  Way ahead of the  Black rap artist  We got this one  The intern came in 
[03:44:00]  And got it from  No  Youth culture  You don't think so  No  Nope  Because we already  Knew the term  Before that  You just hadn't  Used it yet  Yeah  I don't say no homo  This guy says  Because it  Delegitimizes  Love and sexual  Identities  Holy shit  Fuck  Would you want to  Hang out with this guy  Good point  Good point  No homo  Right  No homo  But because it  Delegitimizes 
[03:44:30]  Delegitimizes  Delegitimizes  Love and sexual  Identities  I don't give a fuck  Who you love  And I still want to  Say no homo  Is that okay  I don't think  I'm really sensitive  To like the R word  The M word  The N word  The F word  They're all great to say  But I can never  Pick the right one  They're a lot of fun  Imagine yelling  Them all at the same person  What a disaster  It is walking down the street  I wouldn't  I wouldn't go up  To a retard  And go  You're a retard  Geez 
[03:45:00]  That word  I wouldn't say  The R word  Oh you don't even  Say the word anymore  Why  And you'll stop  We have to  Have you seen our staff  How old is your son  Four  Yeah  Yeah you'll stop  Why  Because you get parents  That you get into  A place  Where that word  Then hurts someone  That's really close to you  But I'm also not  Going to say it around  Like you know  A classroom  Or any of that shit  Here's the thing  With those words  And I don't want to be  Fucking political 
[03:45:30]  Correcting this for you  Please  But if they're on your tongue  They come out  Quick  Cock  A cock  But like if you  If you do  They come out quicker  So like if you say  That word a lot  Like you will say it  Very quickly  In the wrong situation  And not realize  What you said  I don't use retard  I wouldn't say that  I use it in my act once  I would say it like  Here occasionally  We say it occasionally  We say it on our radio show  It's very rarely though  Very different than our lives  But I am very conscious of it 
[03:46:00]  If I'm around people  I would never say it  For fear that somebody else has  And I don't mean like  As a comedy thing  I mean like  In a social setting  You certainly don't want to  Hurt someone's feelings  Yeah yeah  But I'll drop an N-bomb  Like a motherfucker  Especially at home  When I'm playing Xbox  Oh man if you get a microphone  In my house  I'm done  But  Among your friends  You don't say the word  No no  When you guys are just  Fucking around  And someone does something  Retard  You go oh  Stop being a retard  No it was in my act  I took it out 
[03:46:30]  I only took it out  But just because I have  Friends whose children  Have special needs  And so yeah  If they heard me say that  Then they'd think  I don't know that's  It's me  I'm over sensitive  The reason  No no no  It's like I understand that  Like I know  I don't purposely  Want to hurt somebody  I never watch it  That's not my desire  Certainly  So many things  If I look at them  That literally  Can hurt people  I care about  Yeah  And I figure  I don't show any respect  For the boundaries  Of things that have hurt me  Right  So I won't show them  For any boundaries  That have hurt other people  But I've also attacked 
[03:47:00]  Brutally  The things that I hold  Near and dear  And the things that  Would hurt me  But these are more  Same  Like you wouldn't  Use no homo  You don't use no homo  I don't  I don't  Let's see what  There's no cause for it  What's the next one  I don't say tranny  Hold on now  Let's hear this one out  She must have a horrible time  Trying to get her  Car fixed at Amco  Exactly  It would be  I was broken  I need servicing  I think I need fluid 
[03:47:30]  I don't say tranny  So I couldn't think about it  This is such an obvious joke  I had nothing  It's to you  It's just girl  Exactly  I don't say tranny  I say hello  Come on in  They picked a model  For this one  That looks like  She could have a dick  To be honest with you  I don't say tranny  Because it's insulting  To transgender  And genderqueer communities  I've never heard the term  Genderqueer communities  Genderqueer  I've heard genderqueer  But just the fact that  They can try to empower  The word queer  Queer 
[03:48:00]  And put it in  It's just such fraudulent outrage  And people who don't fit  Traditional labels  Ugh  Wow  Tranny is not  A derogatory word  I think Bailey J  Don't like it  Bailey J says it  Bailey J always said it  Maybe now she explains  Well it's pornographic  If you have such nice tits  And such a big dick  You could say it too  Well exactly  I did recently  So I dropped a few  What's more sensitive  Tranny or she-mail  I think they think 
[03:48:30]  They're both pornographic terms  They're not terms  That have been associated  As far as I know  With violence  Well that's an interesting  Fact you're bringing up  Is that  We're talking about  We're talking about  Sex  We're talking about  Porn and what we see online  Not maybe the person  Who just simply  Wanted a sex change  And then also wants  To raise their children  There you go  Yeah  What if we are just  Talking about the chick  In the movie  Yeah I just assumed  Every tranny  Showed their tits and dick  Yeah right  You just think  Well isn't that  Why you did it  I just assumed 
[03:49:00]  Every single tranny  Just does that  I don't know  In a surprise kind of way  Like pan down  Slowly  Not even  If you're a tranny  You just  Whoever wants to see  The tits and the dick  You just show them  You don't think  There's trannies  That are like  Just living lives  No I didn't know  Until right now  You think they're  All online  Just showing their dick  And tits  Yes exactly  Everyone has been  Documented and tagged  For online purposes  For your breakfast  I just assumed that  I learned something  Fucking funny  Well it's basically  Because anybody with a dick 
[03:49:30]  Does not have a good reputation  Yeah  Anybody with a dick  Is pretty free  To show our dicks  Yeah  So you don't think  That anybody with a cock  Will ever show restraint  On showing it  Right  Yeah  I hope  I hope  That was funny  For humble and friend  I just hope  Oh boy  Have you ever heard  Have you ever heard  Yes  What  Have you ever heard  Todd Glass  Talk about  The word  About using the word  Gay  Like don't call things gay  Have you ever heard  That on Maren's podcast  No  Todd did come out  He's gay  Yeah  And I gotta be  Real honest with you  And I think 
[03:50:00]  That changed a lot  Of my perspective  Of how  And it's not about  Say like  And this is  I'm paraphrasing Todd  And I apologize  If I'm doing a horrible job  But it's not about  The adult tranny  That may be standing  On the corner  We're not offending  That guy  We're talking  What his concern  Was the kid  Who maybe feels  Like he's in the wrong body  And then that  What he feels  Is bad  So like if you say  Your car is gay  Well then a young  14 year old boy  Who's having terms  With his sexuality  Then feels like  Well I'm gay  So everything that is bad  Is gay  So whatever I am  Is bad 
[03:50:30]  Todd explains it  A lot more eloquently  But I heard that  And I literally heard that  And I took the F word  And the word gay  Out of my vocabulary  In my act  I can't  You know  When I'm beating him  On the streets  I still say it  But I can't have it  In my act  I can't have it  In my act  Yeah exactly  Let's move on  To the next one  Tranny  We did that one  Let's see  Who wants to do  The next one  Oh that's gay  There it is  Yeah that's the one  Who wants to do this one  Bert why don't you  Do the honors  I don't say that's so gay  Because sexual orientation 
[03:51:00]  Should not be mocked  Or re-appropriated  As derogatory terms  Yeah  I think that  Using gay  As something like  Oh don't be gay  That's gay  I think it's so far removed  From the actual  Gay person  That it becomes  Something else  It's not  It's a word  That's spelt the same  But has different meaning  I honestly think that  It's  I sort of  At this point  Yeah 
[03:51:30]  Team Harvey  Roland why do you have  A Team Harvey shirt  Firestein  Oh suits  There's a  There's a  There's an  Archie's comic  Book  Man  The character is gay  He's an  Out of the closet  Gay guy  My kids are into comics  And there's a  Which one is it  Which character is it  Givehead  I don't  I think that story  Is done right there  Are you going to laugh  At that one  Or is that too sensitive  No fuck off  I am not too fucking sensitive 
[03:52:00]  I am not too sensitive  You're a comic  Lighting up  Oh no  I'm fucking on board  If it makes me laugh  It makes me laugh  You can't see gay  On stage anymore  Fuck off  Oh no  I know  I understand where some of this  Could be hurtful  But  Yeah  Yeah  It's part of it  We used faggot growing up  We did  I know  I totally remember learning  If you're  If you're our age  You just grew up with that word 
[03:52:30]  And you never  I just never thought  The gay angle  It meant if you didn't want to go  Out that night  You know  Wait  Hold on  Hold on  Yeah exactly  Faggot is  Is  But it became  It didn't mean gay  When we were kids  It wasn't used  But always in a gay way  And it came  Like Anthony said  Way more than that  It was  It was a  Yeah when you called your friend  A faggot  It was because  He didn't want to fucking  Use his car that night  To go out and fucking  I understand why  It started out that way  But then  Everything was  Stop being a faggot  Don't be a faggot  Right 
[03:53:00]  I just think there's so many  Of these fucking situations now  Where words are like  It's so hurtful  It's like  First of all  It's not really hurtful  It's  It's not  Helpful  But I don't think  They're quite as hurtful  As these groups  Like to say they are  And I think  If you're just  A dumb  Straight  Little white kid  You also got  Issues and problems  That are being  Mocked and talked about  But you don't have  That protection  Of these groups  That have  So again  It falls into  That we all have 
[03:53:30]  Our god damn  Crosses to bear  That kind of thing  You know  Just get your group  Stronger  And then none  Of this shit  Will matter  It comes with  Your own personal  Self worth  And your own  Personal strength  And I understand  It's hard for kids  Who are gay  To hear gay gay gay  And have it  Aligned with  Things that are  Taken as being stupid  Or whatever  But  Again  It's another thing  A kid's got to deal with  If you make different  Lifestyle choices  As a kid  And it could be anything  From wanting to wear  Goofy looking pants 
[03:54:00]  To being gay  You're going to be  Made fun of  You're going to have kids  Saying and doing things to you  But I think it's part  Of growing up  And it's got to  Make you stronger  That's so straight  I know  It's so straight  That is straight  And that could be  Akin to being uncool  Or fucking  You know  Exactly  Goofy  It's like  You look so straight  Let's go to the next one  I don't know  So far I think  We're making amazing points  I don't say bitch  Oh this is fucking ridiculous  You don't say bitch  Oh no I say bitch  Oh you say that one  I definitely say bitch  So that one's okay 
[03:54:30]  You know  Yeah 100%  Because chicks are bitches  Period  I agree with this actually  I don't say bitch  Because it insists  That femininity  Is inherently negative  And  Yeah go on a divorce court  And tell me it's not  You fuckers  Well they don't mention cunt  My shit  Yeah that's true  I'll take away bitch  If they give us cunt  Give us cunt  I'll take cunt  In a heartbeat  Inherently negative  That's right  I don't like femininity  Being disparaged  In an inherently negative fashion 
[03:55:00]  And why would it be  Femininity  Being inherently negative  When bitch  Isn't referring to femininity  Well it's a female dog  We all know  It's  But  But you're not  Calling something  You're not making femininity  Look inherently negative  By saying bitch  You're making a bitch  Seem negative  Because she's being a bitch  Femininity's great  Wear a fucking sundress  And a god damn  We love that shit  It's defining  I mean as a fucking man  Is femininity  Exactly  We love when you walk around  The office  With all that cleavage  Right  You filthy cooter showing  Right 
[03:55:30]  But we can't acknowledge  That we see half your tit  As we're asking a question  Fucking hot you bitch  Right  I call my daughters bitches  In my act  Alright  I go these bitches  Snitched on me  Bitches  Yeah  I refer to them  Yeah  In the song  I want my MTV  They say faggot  At the end  Yeah but  SiriusXM has edited that word  Edit it out  That's the money for nothing  The little faggot  Has a car  A plane  The little faggot  Is a million  They're actually 
[03:56:00]  Sticking up for that  Are you serious  That's what they're saying  Yeah  Yeah yeah  That was back in the 80s though  I say at that point  Then don't play the song  But to take the artist's word out  Like that  Don't play the fucking  It drives me nuts  It's the same thing  Just don't play the thing  I wrote  Yeah  It's the same thing  With Uncle  The fucking book  Where they took the M word out  Uncle  Oh yeah yeah  Uncle Tom's Cabin  I know what he's talking about  Tom Sawyer  I read that book  In school  With the M word in  And I remember reading it  And it was like 1987  And being like  Whoa  Holy shit  There's one in the room 
[03:56:30]  He's reading it too  And he's gonna get pissed off  Corey's gonna be mad  We're all gonna get black eyes  The bottom line is  They just shouldn't have you  Read that book in school then  As opposed to editing it  If you think  Nigger Jam is too rough  Then don't give it  To the fucking kids  To read  Fuck that book  You can't edit  Other people's work like that  That's really insulting  To the artist  Right  Then yeah  Like Jimmy said  Then just take it out  Of the schools  What they should be doing  Is no one can hear  Which is an outrage too  By the way 
[03:57:00]  Target the religions  Because that is where  All  And Hitchens pointed this out  It's the most protected speech  Is religious speech  And that is where  All anti-gay hate speech  Comes from  It is religion  Absolutely right  All of it  Hate speech  Comes from religion  At least with the gay stuff  That's where  All of it is born  So if you want  To target things  Stop targeting words  Like faggot and gay  Go after the source  Which is the religion  And don't just go after them  By trying to be a part  Of the religion  Go after them  And brutally attack the religion  Because those are the ones  Who are pushing it 
[03:57:30]  Now Bert  I gotta ask you this question  So like  You don't say gay  You don't say faggot right  Uh yeah  I mean  How do you sign the name  How do you feel about  Gay guys actually using those words  It's okay for them  I don't care  Because they'll throw around  The word faggot like it's nothing  No big deal  And they'll also say  That is gay  Yeah  Even though they are gay themselves  So where do you draw the line  On that  I used to talk a lot  About race in my act  Right 
[03:58:00]  And I just stopped  Because I don't care  Really  I don't care  It's not my fucking  Cross the bear  You don't see color anymore  No I know  But I didn't know  Oh I certainly don't  I just don't feel like  Like I  Don't  I don't really care enough  To lose my job  Does that make sense  Yeah  Okay faggot  What's next  No it absolutely does  Like I got a good job  And I'm really happy  Oh no you gotta be smart about it  Yeah and so I go  I go why even fucking  Toe the line  Slip up maybe  Yeah I just talk about my family  And my stories  And whatever  But that is a good point  Because gay  Gay guys will use the word faggot as well 
[03:58:30]  Oh I  Rope  Don't get me wrong  I think what's happening  They're making it  Tough for themselves  At that point  No  Shouldn't it be banned  Across the board then  I believe that what's happening  Is they're taking people  That have good views  And are honest  And have good hearts  Out of the conversation  Right  Because people are afraid  To talk about it  Afraid to even say it  It's sad  I've talked to  Go ahead  No go ahead  No no I was just  I think that I do have an opinion  I'd love to share it  But I don't want to  Because I don't want to get fucking fired  So I keep my mouth shut  I'm just confused by it  Well we're on the bitch word right now 
[03:59:00]  Women say bitch all day long  She's being a bitch  Stop being a bitch  So  What is the problem with the word?  Hey women say retard a lot  A lot more than men  That's retarded  A lot  See the thing  We're in a culture  Where there's subsets of groups  Who can use the word  Well if you're a black guy  You can say nigga  Yeah  Even though that makes you sound  Like a fucking southern plantation owner  You don't sound like you're saying a new word  It's still a racist word  That's true  You don't sound smart  You sound like  Hello nigga  That was something they said  Fucking 400 years ago 
[03:59:30]  It's not  But it's not an evolved  Throughout Long Island  It's not an empowering word  So stop bullshitting yourself  Yes right  Just admit you're using a word  That you don't want other people to do  Where when gay guys say queer  Or when there's little groups  That can say it  You can say it if you're that group  But you can't say it  But if you're a Korean  You can make fun of other Asians  It's just too much to fucking  That's all I'm trying to keep track of  But you're right  You could get in trouble for that  And it's supposedly  You're supposed to be able to have these open discussions  But the second it starts 
[04:00:00]  I watched that goddamn Katie Couric show  And she's like  We're going to have an open  And honest racial discussion  It's 2014  It's time we have these open discussions  About race  And it was a bunch of black people  Getting up on our stage  And talking about how awful white people are  And how awful they were treated  And no other side of it  So as far as being an open  And honest discussion on race  It can't happen  People are petrified  Right 
[04:00:30]  Of open and honest discussions  By the way  We're wrong about money for nothing  I remember a time  Where they edited  Where they edited the word faggot  Out of the song  What do you mean?  But now people are tweeting like crazy  Saying Classic Rewind  And Deep Tracks  Both  Classic Rewind would  But if you go to the 80s channel  They would edit it  Oh I guess it depends on what channel  Yeah it depends on what channel  Because I've heard edits on the 80s channel  That aren't on Classic Rewind  Alright  Yes  That seems to be weird  The most honest way to have a talk about race  Is one on one 
[04:01:00]  Like I  Yeah yeah yeah  I find like  Who the fuck would want to do that?  Yeah exactly  Alright let's sit down  And talk about the word faggot  Oh my god  What happened to you?  What the fuck?  You're really fun  I had a one on one racial discussion  Friday  Here in the city  You used to be called the machine  Right?  And you want to have one on one discussions?  No I was saying  I had a good  This Tuesday we're going to talk about queer  Wait we were just talking about this 
[04:01:30]  It's not like I brought it up out of nowhere  Me and you  Ew  We'll do that  Welcome to Dork City  Just my friend of color and I  Are sitting down for a cappuccino  Right  Discussing race  Oh my god  I had a black guy on my podcast  And it was fun  Why?  Oh sorry  Traitor  But that's not one on one  It's an audience  Yeah but still  It was neat to hear  People get to hear that  I am not going to defend this  Alright let me  This guy wants in badly 
[04:02:00]  Brian in Chicago  Brian go ahead  We got Bert Kreischer in studio  Yes  Pretty good  You know as someone that was called a fucking faggot  In junior high and early years of high school  I'm gay  I gotta tell you  I would not change a thing  And I think Bert  Your explanation using Todd Glass  Who was so brief to come out in his 50s  Now he wants to use  Protect the word faggot  To not shield the kids  Don't we shield kids enough  My experience was  It helped build character  In the four sports that I played 
[04:02:30]  In high school and junior high  None of my teammates called me a faggot  It was only the loser  But you know  We're just bunch of douches  What were the other three?  There's baton twirling  I know  I was right there with you  A little bit about challenge  Right  Soccer  Badminton  Badminton  Tiddlywinks  Tiddlywinks  How did you play so much sports  When you had the drama class to juggle?  You know I had a very  You know they  And how many 
[04:03:00]  How many  How many bats did you guys ruin  Putting it up your assholes?  Oh Jesus  Oh too far  Much too far  Sorry  I apologize Brian  Just trying to have fun  You gave me a little room there  I decided to go for it  Alright  Thanks Brian  Bullying does define you  What did he say?  I said 17 bats when you had it  Oh  You did  Alright  Thanks Brian  I appreciate it  We gotta move on to the next word  Alright  What's the next word? 
[04:03:30]  Sam go ahead  Sam Roberts  The next word is  Oh it's a whole montage  We don't say  Man up  Do you want to go to the next big one?  If you ask me  No go  It's ridiculous to not say man up  It says  We don't say man up because  This was  It's hard to read from here  Strength is not  Strength is not defined by sex or gender  That's right  That's so stupid  Adam  That's absolutely right  Why don't you man up  Man up means that you're  Doing man  Things that 
[04:04:00]  Man up  Men like to do  What's that supposed to mean?  So the next time a man punches a woman in the face  Don't look at it any differently  Than a woman punching another woman in the face  Exactly  Don't judge that any differently  Than two girls fighting  Oh that's right  Man up  Don't be a pussy  Because  There might be a reason for that  Let's hear it  Don't be a pussy  We don't say don't be a pussy  Because I don't believe that any gender is inferior  So this pussy is equated to  They should also have don't be a dick on there also  Ah  If they don't have don't be a pussy 
[04:04:30]  Don't be a dick  You're right  That's true  That is not on there  What guys say to each other all the time  Don't be a bag of lima beans  Oh that doesn't even make sense  Don't be a bag of dirty socks  Don't be a dick  Don't be a dick  Don't be a dick should be on there too  Guys say that to each other all the time  Oh man  The bitch one we did or is it a different  Have some balls  They say it differently  No it's the same bitch  Alright same no homo  And same that's  That's so gay  No I think no homo is different  Alright what does this one say  Oh this says because it means that 
[04:05:00]  Showing any affection towards someone  Of the same sex is inherently bad  But I'm doing it short for homo erectus  Oh  See so that doesn't mean  Oh look at you  Fancy man  Homo erectus  Someone did well in school  No I didn't  And this gentleman doesn't say that's so gay  Because the words gay and stupid  Are not interchangeable  What  That's so stupid  That's so gay  That's  Is that what it means  That's so stupid 
[04:05:30]  That's so gay  Well no  That's kind of wrong  How about those tits  I never say how about those tits  Because to divide someone by their big juicy delicious tits  Is fantastic and proper  Is that it for this  I mean no there's a bunch of them  Keep going  Do we get them all  Well I mean there's different reasons for all these phrases  But they're the same ones  I don't say no homo because it limits the ways we express kindness to others 
[04:06:00]  And disfigures the kindness of an entire group of people  What  That doesn't even make sense  No homo never really got a chance  It's only been out for like four years  I know it's a new one  You don't say  Get it  It's not like  Oh you don't say  It's you don't say  Don't say  This is fucking bizarre  These times we live in  No the college students are getting something done  People making up words we can't even say  Why doesn't he say fag  How about the three R's  Reading, writing, and arithmetic  Attaboyant  Right 
[04:06:30]  And the one that we can't say anymore  Which was the most fun  Right  I think vocal cords shouldn't develop until you're fucking 30  There you go  Just shut up  These people have nothing to say  They haven't lived a fucking life  Be seen and not heard  Exactly  That is  Insulting  It's  It's limiting  I'm actually we're just going to sit around and just nod at each other  So we don't offend anyone  But don't nod in a certain way  It'll get down to that  What did you mean by that nod? 
[04:07:00]  I saw it went sideways a little bit  God  It's something inherent in these people that they are never going to be happy  So I kind of wonder what if we did take one month of being 100% politically correct  Correct  What would they find then?  That would be a horrendous fucking way of life  They would find something else  Oh, it's a bad month  They would find something else  We talked about this with Nappy Headed Ho  We said every group is going to need to ban their word  That is now happening  And now we're starting to notice that there's a second level of words that the groups want banned as well  So where does it end? 
[04:07:30]  It doesn't  Because you've empowered them  They have an outlet  They have this way to influence other people  No one gives that up  Once you're given what you want, you keep going  I believe offended people are powerless people  I believe it's the same people that cross the street slowly  They have no power in their life  Oh, so every opportunity they can fuck someone over  Or try to have power over somebody  They're going to take it  That's a good point  Yeah, and so I know people that get offended 
[04:08:00]  And they are powerless in their own lives  They don't get to tell  They don't get to pick when they wake up  Their boss does  They have to go through the same fucking traffic  And that fucking pisses them off  And I believe that offended people will always  They're always going to feel that way  And they're always going to look to grab some sort of power  And I don't know  I don't know who gets offended  I don't think the same people that get hurt  When you say retard  Because they have a child that is mentally handicapped  It's not the same type of hurt 
[04:08:30]  As a gay guy hearing the word fag being used  It's just not  That is a realistic pain that the parent is feeling over their child  The fag thing is like  Name calling, you don't like that  There are things I don't like  But I don't have the power to conjure up a group  You know, alcohol  I'm very sensitive to that word too  Is it alcoholic?  I don't appreciate that 
[04:09:00]  I don't make jokes about black livers  Was it racist?  Which one?  Racist I am proud to be called  Because it means I'm winning the argument  Cat lover  Which one?  Yes, little Beavis is adorable  Little Beavis  I'm not a crazy cat lady  I've heard that  All right  This guy wants to explain the F word  Let's give him his moment here  Frank in Cleveland  Oh, well  Frank  Frank  Okay  Frank  Frank  If you remember the movie Back to the Future like we all do 
[04:09:30]  Anybody that's watched it  When they were in the car  And Marty was like  Oh, you drink?  You smoke too?  Lorraine was like  Don't be such a square  If that scene had been taking place in 1985  She would have called him a faggot  Stop being such a faggot  Maybe  Don't be such a square  I like that one too  Because  When  When  When Biff's  When Biff's guys go  Hey, beat it  Spook  This don't concern you  And it's like  That was a comedy movie  Right  Yeah  Oh, you know 
[04:10:00]  How to use that word  Oh, no  Oh, dude  Look at  Look at  Look at  Look at  Look at  Look at  Look at  Like Porky's  That is straight up  Rape  Right  They are raping people  Right  I mean  They're putting  They're  Completely  You'd go to  Fucking jail  Yes  You would be  You'd be the  Stupid Bill 5  If Porky's  Took place today  We saw that movie  Stupid  We saw that movie in theaters  And thought nothing of it  That was hilarious  Oh, it defined  How we presented ourselves  Sexually  I took my dick out  All the fucking time  Why wouldn't you?  I thought that was a move  You were supposed to 
[04:10:30]  De-panting people  Do you remember de-panting people?  Ah, you'd just pull their pants  And underwear down from behind them  And then they would show their dick and balls  To strangers  And then you'd go  You're a dick  Yeah  You're such a dick  Well, you want to see my ass faggot?  Right  I was calling people kites  For a long time  Oh, because you thought  That was the word  Kite  You're not even a good racist  It's kike  That was a great scene  That was really funny  I'm a good racist  By the way, one of the funniest moments  I will ever say on this show  I remember where I was driving  When Louis and Patrice 
[04:11:00]  Had that cover  Oh, God  That was funny  On where did the word nigger come from?  Oh, dude  I  Everyone  You always hear from people on radio go  I pulled my car over  Yeah, yeah  I literally pulled my car over  And could not stop fucking laughing  Because I think first  Patrice kind of had this  Kind of eloquent  Funny version of  Where it came from  And then Louis just  You got the Patrice part too?  Oh, play it  It's my favorite thing  I've ever fucking heard  It's online  It's so easy to fucking find  Yeah  I have the Louis part  Do you have the Patrice part?  You got to play the Patrice part too 
[04:11:30]  The set up is what makes it amazing  It is  It was so fucking well done  But  Yeah  I was driving to tennis  I used to listen to the show  Every morning driving to tennis  Played tennis with this old man  That's right  Every fucking morning  You're the tennis guy  And fucking I remember  Pulling my car over  And thinking  I've heard people say  They do that  But I actually fucking did it  Was that it?  Look at this  Yep  Wow  Hey, here's some interesting news  About the Jew thing  I do know where the term kite came from  By the way  Ah, derogatory term for Jewish people 
[04:12:00]  Yes, I see what  I do know where that came from  Where?  It is  When people used to come  Over on the  You know  In the ships  On Ellis Island  A lot of people couldn't write English  So they used to make their mark  And the Jew's mark was a circle  And the circle is called keichel  So that's what  They were just showing it to keich  The guys  Oh, yeah  Here's another keich  Once they've seen the circle  You know where a nigger came from?  Originally  There was some black guy being a nigger  That's what they called him a nigger 
[04:12:30]  Jesus  He was being a real nigger  What a nigger  And that's where it started  It just was a  Nigger was a feeling  Yeah  He was just like  This is my  Look at him  Yeah, it was just some wordplay  Just blurting out a sound  And it came out like that  Just the guy was being such a nigger  That it fucking made someone say the word  Oh, my God, man 
[04:13:00]  That's so awful  We were learning about  Derogatory terms  And where they came from  That's right  Wow  It's history  It's a really good history  It's history  You never knew it  Say hi to Jesse  Jesse, what's up?  Oh, my God  Wow  That fucking Louis  I was not expecting that  When he blurted that one out  Holy shit  Yeah, because Patrice had a real  You know, this is what  I heard about Ellis Island  Going  It's so interesting 
[04:13:30]  I'm not to get into Patrice  But like  It's so  The way he would  The way I remember him telling something  It was insightful  But owning the hurtfulness  Of what he was about to say to you  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  And like saying like  I hope you're about to  I wrote a chapter  There's a  Patrice's in my book  I dated a girl with cerebral palsy  And didn't know she had cerebral palsy  Because I was drinking so much  And Patrice  And I flew her to Scotland  And I found out she had cerebral palsy after  And Patrice thought it was fucking hilarious  That I was such an alcoholic  Because she was so drunk 
[04:14:00]  I couldn't tell she had cerebral palsy  And Patrice met her  And it was her right arm  And we were in Scotland  And she extended her left hand  To shake hands with him  He's like  Who the fuck you think  You ain't the queen, bitch  Oh, no  Put you on there  Give me the baby hand  And it's fucking  Oh, shit  And it was me, Voss, Ben Bailey  I think  It was either Voss or Ben Bailey  And for the whole fuck  Him and her hated each other  And the second  The first night  Patrice bombed 
[04:14:30]  And she said something like  I thought you'd be funnier  Boy, I could hear  Oh, no  The landmine click  Under her foot  Oh, man  And she didn't know  She had stepped on it  I was like  This is gonna be a long trip  The best part of the whole story  Is I fucking got a TV show  And I left  And I left her with Patrice  For a fucking like two weeks  Oh, shit  And Patrice would call me nonstop  Bitch, get this bitch  Get this baby leg bitch  Out of my house  Holy shit  She was left with him  She left with him  And I thought  Why would she just go home?  She was a trust fund kid  I don't know  I really didn't fucking 
[04:15:00]  Pay much attention  I really didn't know  She had cerebral palsy  Three dates  I dated a girl like that once  Did you chip?  Well, we had the one-armed girl  In our studio  We had no idea  Dude  That's true  We had the one-armed girl  That was  She hid upon her purse?  She was Bill O'Reilly's producer  She came in for a while  And then she became friends  With all of us  And she was around all the time  She had a plastic hand  She had a plastic hand  With a bracelet on it  A little bracelet on it  It was like a rubber  Real hand  Game of Thrones  And the big reveal was  We were at a signing  And all  I  Either someone told me  Or I saw it myself 
[04:15:30]  I don't remember anymore  But we were at a signing  At Hooters  And I looked over  And went  And had the  Revelation  That she had a fake arm  And then I told these guys  And we're all just  Stupefied  We're like  How the fuck  Does not one of us  Realize she had a fake arm  Well my chick was hot as fuck  And  She was really  She looked like  She looked like  Fucking button  The vampire slayer  That girl  Yes  She was in a funhouse mirror  No but you couldn't tell  And we were drinking in Soho 
[04:16:00]  And it's like cobblestone streets  And they know how to like  Kind of like work it  And you're always  They know how to work it in a way  Like they're not gonna  Just show it to you  Yeah  And my buddy Weecho told me  He goes  You need to go out with her  In the daylight  And I thought he was saying  She was a dude  And I was like  Nah she's fine  But I went out with her  And she was wearing sneakers  And I remember  That was my first sign  I was like  She's wearing sneakers  And then we went to lunch  Like right from where  She had like a huge house  On the upper east side  And we went to lunch  Right around there  And she ordered a salad  And I noticed she was just  Eating with her left hand  And I was like  Mother  I was like 
[04:16:30]  We're gonna get some cocktails  So did you look at the right hand  I looked  And then I figured it out  Did it look bad  No it didn't  It didn't look bad  And she was hot as fuck naked  And it didn't look totally bad  It just  She definitely could not  Use her right hand  Wow  And the best part of all of it  Is that Patrice just kept  Hammering me  You're such an alcoholic  Like you drink so much  That you don't even  Fucking notice  That's crazy  And she was a big fan  Of Guns N' Roses  And I got a show  Where I interviewed Slash  And by this  Like six months later  I called her 
[04:17:00]  And I told her  I'm interviewing Slash  If you want  You can come down  And meet Slash  And Slash had just  Gotten kicked out  Of his house  By his chick  He was sleeping on the couch  And he was having a bad night  He came into the show  I was doing  And looking for whiskey  And I had it  So we started drinking  At like six in the morning  And I'm drinking with Slash  She shows up  I do the interview with Slash  It's fucking amazing  The best interview  I've ever done in my life  We go to my green room  And I introduce her to Slash  And she's fucking through the roof  And Slash is like  She's hot as fuck  And then she gets up  To go to the bathroom  And I see  It's noticeable  Oh no  They're all fucking  Halogen lights  You can see it  She reaches across her body 
[04:17:30]  To open the door  And I'm like  Okay  Was he just hanging  And yeah  And Slash looks at me  And he's like  She's perfect  And all I could hear  Was Patrice's head  Like you're as big  As an alcoholic as Slash  Oh no  I could hear it  In my head  Not quite perfect Slash  Why'd you blow her off  Because she had cerebral palsy  She sucked my dick  One night  And her ex-boyfriend called  In the middle  Like right after  And she started fighting with him  And I was like  You just sucked my dick  And so I was like  I was like  I'm not into drama 
[04:18:00]  It was when I was like  Trying to fucking  You know what it was  She probably left like  Six right gloves  At his house  And he wanted them back  I have no use for these  She's like  I don't either  Sorry  Sorry  She sucked my dick  And she couldn't juggle  The balls  The way I preferred  She had to take her left arm  And grab her right elbow  And juggle that way  And it felt silly  Shake her arm  She one night  Got really fucking drunk  In Scotland  And got naked  And stood at the front of my bed  And was like  We are naked  We are not fucking 
[04:18:30]  Like she was crazy  We are not fucking  We are not fucking  And Patrice stuck his head  In the room and saw it  And I could see him  Look at me  And his eyes were wide  And he shut the door  And the next morning  Like that trip  We just watched  Kung fu videos  And listened to hip hop  And he tried to explain  Both to me  And the next morning  He was eaten  Ready to fucking talk  What happened last night  And I was like  Fucking crazy  Wow  Yeah  Fuck  When's the book coming out?

Snow  It's like  It's actually an airport runway  So like  Like a snowed in  Airport runway  Were you scared?  I was a little bit  Because I'm at the age  Where I'm always afraid  I'm going to blow my knee out  I've had a few  I've had a few moments  Where I thought I was going to die  On this show  Like we went  Hello skiing  And I'd never really 
[04:20:30]  Snowboarded in powder before  And we're like  12,000  13,000 feet  In the Alps  Wow  And I fucking ate it  Face forward  And I landed in  Four feet of powder  And I couldn't get myself out  And now mind you  You're following a guide  Who's telling you  Where not to go  Because there's crevasses  And there's avalanches  And there's all that shit  And I'm following  And I'm watching  But I'm also listening to  Wilco  I'm a little out of it  Like I'm having a good time  But then I eat it  And I'm stuck face forward  I'm thinking  Is anyone behind me?  Like no one's behind me  I'm fucking here forever 
[04:21:00]  Holy shit  And I couldn't get myself  I kept pushing  Were you buried?  Buried  Buried and I'm fucking  Wait we were just talking about this  The other day  Could you breathe under there?  A little bit  You can but  Panic is so fucking intense  Well he was in powder  You were in soft powder  I was in  Low touch powder  Yeah  We were talking about avalanches  But it's  It's similar at least  It was  I was lost  You're like in quicksand  That's snow  And I have a snowboard  On to my feet  And I'm face forward  And every time I push  My hands are just going  Deeper in snow  Right  That sucks 
[04:21:30]  Oh dude  And I thought to myself  This is how I die  I remember thinking  Oh man  Had to get out  And I'm out of breath  Because there's no oxygen up there  And I'm fucking tired  From snowboarding  And I got music blaring  In my hair  Ears  So I can't hear anything  Can you move your arms  And stuff?

I'm sat there  And then all of a sudden  Something grabbed my jacket  And pulled me up  And it's a Swedish guy  Or a Swiss guy 
[04:22:00]  And he's like  You should see your sound guy  And my sound guy  Had fucking eaten shit  And was up  All you saw upside down  Were skis sticking in the air  And I was like  Holy shit  So they brought a helicopter  In to get him off the mountain  And then  And then we skied down  But it was  It was really like  I've had a few of those moments  On this show  Where you just go like  Like  It's intense  It's fucking intense  It's what this show's about  Now it's like  Now it's really high energy  Like  Wow  Fucking thrills  Wow  And I'm 41  I'm at the age  Where you do blow out a knee  You know  And then you blow out a knee

[04:24:00]  From the drug dealer  To film in there  This was the one favela  That there's a movie about  Apparently  This is the favela  That the dirty cops  Went in and cleaned out  And there's a big movie  About it in Brazil  That everyone's like  You haven't seen it  And they're like  He lived right there  And there are these  Like police  Like almost like  A skeleton  Symbols all over the place  Meaning like  The police run this favela  So it's not that  It wasn't that dangerous  And you know  Aren't they corrupt though  Too down there  A bit  I mean I think so  We're going back  So I'm not going to say  Too much about them  But 
[04:24:30]  Yeah  But you weren't scared in there  I was scared  I think that's part of  This show  It's part of  Travel in general  Is to get out of your  Comfort zone  And be a little scared  When you do shit  Right  You know  How was your hotel room  It was actually  It was kind of shitty  In that hotel  Yeah yeah  It was just a bed  No air conditioning  And it was like  It was like a  Like one of those  Clay hut  And like  You know like  Those clay type huts  Where it's like  No windows  It's just a hole  In the holes  Looks out  You're saying it was  A nice hotel  It was a nice hotel  But it's not like  Five star  It would not even be  A star  But your room is shitty  I'm confused 
[04:25:00]  Fucking  It's  What you said  I know  But it's like  It's a nice hotel  But it's not a  Five star hotel  For the favelas  For the favelas  It's extremely  Fucking nice  It's a palace  I got you  It's beautiful views  Absolutely gorgeous  The best views  I've ever seen  In my entire life  Of Rio  Right  But I mean  You wouldn't really  Want to  You know  Other than saying  You stayed in a favela  Well  We're wrapping up  And actually  Travis is saying  You gotta go  Yeah  I guess  I don't know  You doing a lot  Of promotion today  I have a busy day  I'm doing Ron and Fez  I think

[04:37:30]  Bert Kreischer  Back in the house today  It's been almost two years  Since he stopped by  I think  You don't have a date  On the last appearance  Do you Eric?  Not with me  I don't  Always great  Always great  To hear from Bert  And I also love how like  And I would  I wish he was still here  Because this is what I wanted  To talk to him about  He came in  And it was almost like  He was saying that he had  Made changes  To be what he felt  Was a better person  He was talking about 
[04:38:00]  Not using certain words  Anymore  Because  They affected people  In his life  Or people close to him  And he was talking about  You know  When you're a parent  Maybe using the R word  You know  It's different  Because you meet parents  And that affects them  And blah blah blah  And it seemed like  He was trying to make  Positive life changes  And there is nothing  And no place  Like the Opie and Anthony show  That will make you think twice  About making any positive life changes  Eric I think you know that  Better than anybody  Is that right? 
[04:38:30]  Yeah  This is not the most  Supportive environment  No  It's the moment  Any change is made  You're an asshole  They become very critical of it  What do you think  Is an example  Do you have any examples  Of a positive life change  That you tried to make  That they instantly  Just started shitting all over  To the point where you were like  Fuck it  Then I won't do it  I don't have to think about that  Because there's been so many things  That they just shit on  Sal was just telling me  Last time Bert was here  Was June 2011 
[04:39:00]  So  Three years  Yeah almost three years  Sal  Have you been here long enough  That you've tried to  I mean  Anytime Sal walks in  If he's got a beard  Any kind of facial hair  He's thrown under the bus  Anything that's instantaneously obvious  But have they curtailed  Any positive growth  In your life whatsoever  Yeah probably work ethic wise  I'd say  You think so  In what way  It'll definitely fucking  Straighten me out  Like for sure  Yeah but that's making  A positive change  Not you making a positive change 
[04:39:30]  No it's them preventing you  From making a positive change  That's what we're looking for  Oh  Making a  I don't have anything currently  No  Well you don't focus  That's the problem  Probably  Hey have you and Eric  Been working on your lists  You know what  At Sal  Yes  Have you and Eric  Been working on your lists  What  Your lists  Do you know what I'm talking about  I know what you're talking about  Of course you do  And this gets added  To your list  This is number two  Have you been working on your list  Yes  But Sal's been pretty good 
[04:40:00]  This past week  There was a lot going on  Everybody was really  Kind of  Stepping up  Maybe I should give you  Give you another week  Yeah maybe  And Sal  Everybody was doing good last week  Sal has no idea  What we're talking about  No I have  Well me and Eric  Agreed to not  Do the list  Yeah I don't care  What you and Eric  Agreed to  It doesn't matter  If something gets said  On the air  You and Eric  Can say whatever you want  But guess what  You coming on the air  And being like  Well me and Eric  Have decided we're friends  Has never worked for you  In the past  And it's never going to work for you 
[04:40:30]  To answer that question  Yes I have the list  And Eric  You should not let Sal  Off the hook like that  Because how many times  Has he come on  And been like  No everything's cool  With me and Eric  And then the minute  You leave the room  Take every opportunity  He can to shit on you  That is true  Do not let him  Off the hook like that  He's trying to do  What he does every time  And when the heat  Gets packed on  Like oh  You know maybe there could  Then he tries to skirt out of it  Well no him and I  Not last week  I guess it started  The end of the week  Before that  We had talked about it  The list and all that 
[04:41:00]  And I know he was  Paying attention last week  And I was paying attention  To him  And like Sal said  We did kind of say  Like well if there's  Nothing really there  We're not going to  Force the issue here  And like I said  Last week there really  Wasn't anything  So there's no need  To bring it up  I'm being overly specific  Yeah  You know like for  Like little things  Nothing exciting  But for your information  When we were in there  For the pre-show  All that had to  A clip  Even if there was 
[04:41:30]  Something wrong  With the editing  That Sal  To Sal's ear  Like I wouldn't even  Pick up  But Sal was like  That was a bad edit  And that's going on the list  Well when something's  Three minutes  And you have to chop it down  Something's got to go  Don't make excuses  Don't say you have bad edits  I'm not saying I have bad edits  He said he's putting it on the list  Not because it's an edit  Because it's a bad edit  Good  That's right  Then he's more than happy  To take over that assignment  Well maybe  But we're going to get back  On this list thing  Okay  Another thing  No  I will stick to the list  And you know 
[04:42:00]  If something major happens  Of course you know  That'll probably come to air  Probably before we go down the list  But I'm going to keep the list going  And I'm sure  Iroch has this as well  And you guys don't need to be  Discussing this with each other either  I don't see what good  That could  Because one of you  Is going to turn on the other one  That's the only reason  As of now  Iroch does not know my list  And I have no idea  What he has on me  Well Iroch said  He's only got two things  On his list about you  Iroch and Sal agreed  To make a fuck up list  Last week  Or the week before  Listing  Because they were arguing  Over who fucks up more 
[04:42:30]  I have six on my list right now  You have six  Alright  So you're at six to two  Iroch said  He doesn't fuck up more  Than anybody else  Sal  Just  Or everybody  Not just Sal  Everybody brings up  Iroch's fuck ups  So like  Anytime Iroch screws anything up  It gets brought to the table  Whereas if Sal screws something up  Behind the scenes  It's not brought to the table  Sal on the other hand  Is saying that it's not true  Iroch just fucks up a whole lot more 
[04:43:00]  Is that right Sal?  Yeah I agree  Yeah  Okay  Well we're going to find out  Because we're going to get back  On the list train  And we're going to find out  Because either  Either enough of Sal's lip  Or  We have to admit  That we were wrong  Right?  No  I'm team  Sex bagel here  I'm in the  Iraq army  N-word  You know what I mean?  Thank you for saying that  You're welcome  And I'm not trying to offend anybody  I'm not trying to offend  Burt Kreischer  I'll say  Iraq army 
[04:43:30]  N-word  And let it set at that  Right  Now Sal  Do we have line of the day  Or is Iraq going to have  Something for his list?  I got it right  Okay  Here  Comes  Light of the day  Light of the day  Light of the day  There's a  There's a  There's an Archie's comic book  Man  The character is gay  He's an 
[04:44:00]  Out of the closet gay guy  My kids are into comics  And there's a  Which one is it?  Which character is it?  Give head  I don't  That was a funny line  That was a funny joke  Very good sound  Good pull  Iraq  You caught  We were  Looking at  Other things  That we talked about  Today on the show  Of course  Burt Kreischer  In studio  And that was  The voice you heard  On that clip  But we were talking  About a whole bunch  Of other stuff  We were talking  About the Lindsay  Lohan show  We were talking  About the marathon  And having a debate 
[04:44:30]  About genetics  That was getting  Very close to  Eugenics  It didn't get there  But it was getting  Close at times  But you  Sent a gift  In the show's honor  To Scott Shannon  Is that right?  And this is what I said  You have that  Narrow  Single focus  It's all  Building the Scott Shannon  Opie and Anthony  Relationship for you  Isn't it?  Oh of course  Why is that?  It's just  It's time  It's time 
[04:45:00]  To do  Right  And make some  Connections  In this industry  Instead of  Hating everybody  Is this  Your way  Of bringing  Batman and  Superman together?  Are you  Right now  Living out  Your childhood  Fantasies  And by the way  There's nothing  Wrong with that  That's what  We're supposed  To be doing  Are you  Living out  Your childhood  Fantasies  Of bringing  The two shows  That influenced  You most of all  You've said  Many times  You grew up  On Scott Shannon's  Show  And then  Evolved into  An Opie and  Anthony fan  Is that right?  That is right  Are you 
[04:45:30]  E-Rock  Radio  Are you  Using your  Power in radio  Now to try  To bring your  Two shows  Together  Just because  It's something  That when you  Were a kid  You thought  Was awesome  I think I  Already have  You have  You've orchestrated  This just because  This is cool  To you  There was an  Opportunity  Yeah  When things  Went bad  With his  Old partner  And got him  On  I love that  E-Rock's doing  The radio thing  Too  Where he's  So Team Scott

[04:47:30]  And that was my  Opinion  Very honestly  Because brothers  Are always in trains  Uh huh  I've never been in a train  That's not a white guy thing  Have you ever been in a train  Jimmy  Well that's a bad guy to ask  I have yes  Many  On the train  And the clean up committee  The clean up committee  Jesus  It's cream pie removal  Yes  Right  I don't know why he had to add in  The cream pie removal part  Like  Oh there was already 
[04:48:00]  Like when he said  Yes I've been on the train  And in the clean up committee  You go oh  And then Jim  Jim just has to go  A step further  And add in  That he cleaned out  Cream pies  You ever clean out  A cream pie  No  Okay good  But I think he's implying  He's cleaning out  The other guy's cream pie  Oh  Either way  I mean  It's even worse  You ever clean out  A cream pie Sal  I'm not even sure  What a cream pie is  Do you want me to tell you  No I don't want to know  It's when there's  Ejaculate inside of a vagina  Oh  Yeah that's right  And then Jim cleans it up 
[04:48:30]  I talk to Denny about that a lot  You do  Yeah  No  I'm sure Denny's all for it  Being that he works blue  What was Erock's clip of the day  And we had to deal with  Jim's excited post  Successful photo op energy  Oh yeah  I got it  Well but it was more than that  Like he starts like  He just gets overly touchy  And does this like  Friendly guy character  Like he kept for like  30-40 minutes  Putting his arms around me  And Opie  He wouldn't stop  Boys you know  Sometimes you want to  Take a photo  And yeah  All you got to do  Is ask boys 
[04:49:00]  You know  Let me tell you something  I was in my happy  I was in my happy  I kept grabbing  Sam by the shoulders  And shaking them  And walking through  The experience again  It's been quite a good time  Did you see  Did you see the part  When I went up to him  And I  Oh god  Sometimes the boys  You just got  It was really fun  That would have been fun  For a minute  He did that for 30-40 minutes  At least 30-40 minutes  Probably 40 minutes  A lot of laughs  A lot of touching  A lot of shaking  The boys' shoulders  Oh god  Oh no idea  Yeah  I get why you pulled that clip  Because you've been part of that 
[04:49:30]  Positive  You've been on both ends  You know what it's like  So we were talking about  The fact that we  Opie, Jim and myself  Went to see  The Evander Holyfield  Mike Tyson movie  Champs  That premiered at Tribeca  Over the weekend  And Evander Holyfield  Was there  Jim hadn't met him  So Jim went to get a photo  With Holyfield  And we were talking about  The positive  Positive Jim  That comes out of  A successful attempt  You've been there  Both for the 
[04:50:00]  Positive energy  And the negative energy  Right  And I don't know  If he was doing this  When he got his  Holyfield photo  Jim has this weird  Switch in his head  Where when he's trying  To get the photo  He's at fan level  And this person is  Like superstar  Celebrity level  Jim gets the photo  He's looking at it  He checks everything  Makes sure it's good  Then he morphs into this  They're on equal paring  Like oh he's an old friend  Kind of thing  Like they've been 
[04:50:30]  Friends for years  In this business  Have seen everything  Now he's at this level  With the celebrity  And he just walks around  Like it was no big deal  But when he asked  The celebrity for the photo  It's as if he's never been  A part of show business  Whatsoever  No he's constantly  Staring at the person  He wants to get the photo with  And ignores everything around him  We talked about it  On the show today  He literally  Asked  Evander Holyfield  Evander Holyfield  For a photo  By saying  Could I have a photo  He said could  Not could 
[04:51:00]  Not can  Could I have a photo  Like a little kid  Going up to an athlete  Yeah  Like I said  You might as well  Have just tugged  On his shirt sleeve  Excuse me  Excuse me Mr. Boxer  Yeah  Mr. Boxer man  Uh  Snowy in Michigan  What's up buddy  Before I get to that point  Um  I thought what Iraq did  Was a very thoughtful gift  To Scott  Myself  I think that's very thoughtful  You mean the boat movie  Yeah the boat movie  Right  Um 
[04:51:30]  Sam  I have to ask  Uh  At this dinner  After that movie  Did you uh  Have a  Adult people food  Did they have chicken fingers  And french fries for you  Or did they  Eat real food  Or something  Snowy I had the fish  Oh fish  Good man  That's right  We all grow and evolve  I had  I had a nice  Fluke  Really  That's right  Fluke  That's right  Ben in Boston  Fried and breaded  No  Wow  Seared  Hello  What's up Ben  Uh  We both need to agree
