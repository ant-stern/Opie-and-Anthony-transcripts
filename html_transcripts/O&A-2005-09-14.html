<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Manhattan's extreme traffic due to the UN and presidential visits, seguing into a discussion of Rob Bartlett's Brian Wilson impersonation on the Imus show (Bartlett was wearing an Opie and Anthony t-shirt).  The hosts then touched on their relationships with other radio personalities (Sean Hannity, Don Imus, Ron and Fez),  Jimmy Norton's absence (in Los Angeles), and their disdain for female radio co-hosts.  Bob Kelly, guest-hosting for Norton, promoted his website, RobertKelleyLive.com.  This led to discussions of RateMyWow.com (a listener-submitted photo website with a focus on breasts), the *Grizzly Man* documentary (and speculation about the protagonist's suicide), perceived news biases (especially concerning missing children), and a news story about a man escaping a fiery car accident by jumping off the Tappan Zee Bridge.  Martini Steve (RateMyWow) and a mime, Derek, were also guests.  Future guests Otto, George, and Harry Reams were mentioned, along with the "Whip Them Out Wednesday" promotion featuring Gamma O girls distributing stickers.  The overall tone was irreverent and frequently included offensive language and sexually explicit material.


The show then shifted to a discussion of negligent owners of an old folks' home facing murder charges after a hurricane.  This transitioned into criticism of the planned Flight 93 memorial's "Crescent Embrace" design (red maple trees in a crescent shape), with the hosts arguing the crescent symbolized Islam and was inappropriate.  They speculated on liberal interest group involvement.  A caller countered, stating victims' families chose the design, leading to further debate on memorial appropriateness (comparing it to the Oklahoma City memorial).  The hosts also discussed media portrayals of Muslims and the lack of condemnation of terrorism from the Muslim community.  Other topics included Jim Norton's move to Hollywood, the Danny Bonaduce show, Opie's accidental encounter with a Holocaust memorial, Opie's water pill usage, and a vulgar comedic bit involving "kick in the cunt."  Bob Kelly remained a guest, and Harry Reams, the *Deep Throat* star, joined the show.  Reams discussed his career, obscenity trial, alcoholism, recovery, real estate career, his new documentary *Inside Deep Throat*, and Linda Lovelace's allegations.  The segment concluded with promotions for the show and merchandise, and frequent references to Imus indirectly promoting the show.


Harry Reams remained a guest, detailing his life story: his porn career, alcoholism, homelessness, recovery, finding religion, and real estate success. He described his rock bottom, including jail time after a blackout. His recovery involved a 12-step program and making amends.  The hosts and Reams engaged in sexually explicit jokes.  The conversation covered the evolution of the adult film industry.  Later, Gamma O (a testosterone booster) was promoted, with two promotional models present.  A raunchy "wiffle ball bat challenge" ensued, with the models participating in a sexually suggestive game involving a lubricated wiffle bat.  Crude and offensive language was prevalent.


This segment featured graphic sexually explicit content with multiple women (Gamma O) and a wiffle bat. The hosts provided graphic descriptions of their actions.  The hosts discussed Jimmy Norton's potential reaction to the events.  A brief interview with Arrestes (promoting a Spanish-language baseball channel on XM) occurred.  The broadcast included discussions of Hurricane Katrina interwoven with sexually explicit material, a Bob Kelly voiceover demo, and Opie's foot injury complaints.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive remarks continued throughout.


The show began with a Toyota commercial ("$99 down and $99 a month"), followed by graphic storytelling from Anthony about sexual fantasies involving the fathers and grandmothers of his dates.  Anthony stated he couldn't stop creating new sexual fantasies involving family members. Robert Kelly returned to the studio.  A significant portion focused on attempting to decipher unintelligible audio from a school fight between two mothers, filled with obscenities and incoherencies.  The hosts offered absurd interpretations.  They played other audio clips (911 calls, news reports).  An auction promotion for opiananthony.com occurred, including a comedic, exaggerated advertisement for Yankee pinstripe robes.  A news story about disabled children found in cages was briefly discussed.  Listeners called in with show takeaways.  Closing remarks mentioned Bill Burr filling in for Norton the next day and thanked guests, including Harry Reams (who almost relapsed during the show).

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Why don't you go eat a decoder piece of crap? 
[00:04:30]  What the heck are you guys doing?  Trying to ruin my life and make me look like a freaking idiot?  I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:00]  Hey there.  Hey there.  What do I have to adjust today?  Why, problem?  Problem?  I don't know.  Problem?  You sound funny?  Maybe if I turned up my microphone.  Oh, you had it way down.  Way down.  Now we're up.  Now we're up.  Now we're ready for our broadcast day.  On this fine Whip them out.  On this fine Whip them out Wednesday, Anthony.  Oh, it is Wednesday.  It is Whip them out Wednesday.  Supposedly we got girls from Gamma O handing out wow stickers all over Manhattan today. 
[00:05:30]  There you go.  That's the way to do it.  They should be down by the U.N.  That's where all the traffic will be stopped and it will be easy to hand them to people right in their cars.  They should just plaster them on the bumper sticker, bumpers of the diplomats that are all driving around.  So you see some wacky Asian guy with a wow sticker on or some terrorist looking dude in his limo.  I was worried about you today.  I thought you wouldn't make it into work.  No, my hours are pretty good for this whole thing.  You sure?  I'm out.  Yeah, yesterday was like a big day. 
[00:06:00]  The U.N.  And I was out.  Sorry.  Very early.  Sorry.  Someone has turned us on to something and the phone's ringing like crazy.  So we really just have to go to the phones and then we'll get back to the U.N. conversation.  Sally, what's up?  Hi.  The Brian Wilson character on Imus is wearing one of your T-shirts today.  Yeah.  So I'd let you know.  We saw that you called so we went right to MSNBC and there's Imus.  And who is it?  Rob Bartlett?  Yeah.  Bartlett.  He's dressed like Brian Wilson.  Brian Wilson and he has kind of like a Hawaiian-like Beach Boys shirt on. 
[00:06:30]  Beach Boys shirt and underneath that is an Opie and Anthony T-shirt.  It's really, really funny, man.  He's all disheveled.  And they did discuss it for a couple minutes at about a quarter after if you can dig up the audio.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  We're going to need that audio.  Don Imus, a true friend of the Opie and Anthony program, believe it or not.  We love that show and the crew over there is great.  Did he ever come through with that auction bid?  What was he going to do?  That billboard. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know who won the Arthur Cheehan billboard.  They got him fired.  Well, come on.  Get on it, son.  I got knocked out at the last minute, sons of bitches.  But, man, Imus is, he rocks.  He absolutely rocks.  See him today?  He's very gruff, rough and tumble.  He's got his, like, real riding hat on.  Looks like he should be in Deadwood.  He doesn't feel good today either.  He's going to a doctor right afterwards.  Oh, he does?  There's nobody that is as sick as him, you know?  Yeah, he gets sick all the time. 
[00:07:30]  It's because he doesn't eat meat.  For someone that eats very healthy, he's very sick all the time.  Well, when you abuse the shit out of yourself for 70 years and then decide you're going to eat healthy on the latter part, I think your body rejects it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, anyway, there you go.  All right.  Thank you, Sally.  Bye.  Thanks for the heads up.  It's very funny.  It made us laugh really hard today.  We'll have the video up on OpieandAnthony.com, but there you have it.  Yeah.  We've got the weirdest friends in radio.  Yeah, not your common radio friends. 
[00:08:00]  A lot of people in radio have the same stupid friends in radio.  We have, like, Sean Hannity and Don Imus.  Yeah, that's pretty much their business.  And Ron and Fez.  Right.  Brother Weez, BJ Shea, Scott Farrell, and that's it.  Earl Douglas.  And Earl Douglas, that's right.  Earl.  We've got to welcome Bob Kelly to the program.  Bob!  We give nothing but respect to the person sitting in that seat. 
[00:08:30]  That is Jimmy's chair.  You're sitting in Jimmy's chair.  We've got to do what Jimmy does, everyone, and move this mic here.  There we go.  Yeah.  That way I have a good view of you.  Hey, hi.  We can look at each other now and trade our ridiculous ideas for four hours.  Chat.  Jimmy, poor Jimmy's gone.  I know.  He's getting famous.  Nothing against you.  I miss him already, though. 
[00:09:00]  I do, too, man.  I miss him.  I like him when he's here.  A little creep.  A little creep with a boner.  He left without saying goodbye to anyone.  He didn't say goodbye?  No, we threw him a nice party yesterday and everything.  I tried.  I actually said goodbye to him, and for a second I was actually going to shake his hands.  Then I realized they were full of KY jelly and stripper vag juice.  Oh, that's right.  Because he was shoving that dildo in that chick yesterday.  His hands were, like, glistening.  And I went to shake his hand and I went, up!  Well, good luck, bro.  Have fun out there in L.A. 
[00:09:30]  I'm not touching you, you little creep.  We'll see you in a few weeks.  He did the same thing that Colin and Ellen, when they went to Iraq and they came back,  he just left, like, they're at the airport, and he just walked away.  He didn't say goodbye.  That's what he does.  He just disappears.  He just walks away.  He just leaves.  I like that.  I do the same thing around here, though.  I really do.  Like, I won't say goodbye to anybody.  The show ends, especially on travel days like in New York, where it's all crazy and going  to be gridlocked, and I just got to get home immediately.  I won't say goodbye to anybody. 
[00:10:00]  Boom!  I'm out the door.  Yeah, but that's a little different.  You'll be back tomorrow.  He's leaving for three weeks.  Yeah, but Opie one time had a call me on my way.  I was halfway to my car.  He's like, Anthony, we have a meeting with the boss today.  Like, what?  He goes, Elo's in town.  We have a meeting today.  I'm like, fuck, I was almost there.  I almost made it.  I had to turn around and come back.  Yeah, well.  Little Jimmy will be holding up an Emmy soon.  Yeah.  A little thing that looks like him.  Isn't it all golden like him on the bathroom floor?  I'm wearing Anthony a t-shirt on. 
[00:10:30]  If you have a satellite radio on now, can you listen to Sirius or XM, or do you have  to have two separate radios?  Oh, Don.  Well, you'd have to have two separate radios, I mean, if you wanted Sirius.  Right.  If you wouldn't want.  Well, yeah, you would want that.  Okay.  You want Sirius.  I don't own any XM stock.  Well, that's your first mistake, homie.  Could be. 
[00:11:00]  Call him homie.  Might be, yeah.  You should invest in yourself.  That's the first thing I tell you.  How do you think I lost all the publishing rights to my songs?  Well, I'm not sure how that happened.  Anyway, the first thing at 11 after the hour, the business report for the New York Stock Exchange  is coming up, but First Child has some news, and none of it's any good.  It's never.  Bartlett is hysterical, man.  He's imitating, yeah, Brian Wilson with an Opie and Anthony t-shirt on today.  I can't get enough of it. 
[00:11:30]  So flurrying.  His mouth full crooked.  He called him Opie, right?  Yeah, he calls Don Imus Opie.  If you have a radio, can you get Sirius on XM?  Oh, the poor guy.  Come on, Don.  Don knows, though.  Read a magazine about it.  He absolutely knows.  Let's say hi to Brian in Queens.  Hey, Brian.  I'll get it on my old Victrola.  What's up, Brian?  I was just listening to Howard, and he's doing the exact same bit that Anthony was doing. 
[00:12:00]  Intro on the old radio stations, doing the whole disc jockey thing.  He's talking about his new radio station on Sirius.  It's going to be Douche 100 or something like that.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  So, you know, he thinks he invents everything, but he's taking a bit from Anthony.  He's just a jackass.  We noticed that he's pretty much doing our show three or four weeks behind.  Scott from Jersey, what's up?  Same thing, man. 
[00:12:30]  That fucking hooked-nosed Jew is hurting you guys off again.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  He's doing all the shit you guys do.  I'm so sick of it.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, I ain't over here.  What do you want me to do?  Uh-oh.  All right, thanks.  We've got to go back to this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've just learned that from scenes.  Steve just said it's going to rain.  Yeah, I'm Mr. Money Business Report sponsored by the New York Soccer Saints. 
[00:13:00]  Rob Bartlett, man.  Sorry.  We're supposed to be doing our own radio show.  We're just listening to Imus.  We're the worst, man.  We really are.  Don't take a nap on a couch.  It is just, you know, I've got to turn people on to Imus this morning.  MSNBC.  It's the wackiest thing I've ever seen, I think.  That's a funny character, man.  It really is.  Brian Wilson.  His hair is completely a mess.  He's just a mess.  His tongue's hanging out of his mouth.  He's got an O.P. Anthony t-shirt on, and he's just babbling. 
[00:13:30]  That's great.  Anyway, where were we?  Okay, yeah, today is like gridlock all over Manhattan.  That's where we're at.  Yeah, because...  I was worried about you.  I didn't think you were going to make it in today.  They're pretty much warning people, just stay home today.  This is going to be one of the worst driving days ever in Manhattan.  In New York City history, because you've got the president in town.  And what is the U.N. thing all about?  They're having their big pat each other on the back convention that they do every year.  All the world leaders come here. 
[00:14:00]  All the world leaders are in New York.  It's a great day to be here.  Any day.  If anything is going to happen, it's going to happen today.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be just a great thing for terrorists to attack?  And it's New York City...  God.  ...where on a good day, it stinks to drive in here.  It's awful.  For people that work in New York City, it's just horrible.  And then they bring in these world leaders.  You see all the limos and the black cars out there?  Oh, yeah.  Which are a nightmare anyway.  Those drivers stink.  And now they're all over the street. 
[00:14:30]  There's gridlock where people are pulled in the middle of the intersection.  The light turns green for you.  You're not going anywhere.  Because some idiot decided he's going to try to make the yellow light when he's got nowhere to go.  So he sits in the middle of the intersection.  You're sitting there.  Now you've got a green light, so you've got to beep at him.  You just want to broadside him.  You want to weld a piece of railroad track on the front of your vehicle and just broadside him.  And watch his brown terrorist head smash through the passenger window. 
[00:15:00]  Whoa.  Jesus.  They should put the United Nations...  You have no idea, Bob.  ...in Iowa.  ...in case driving.  Why don't they put the U.N. in Iowa?  They don't care.  You've got to take a plane there anyway from Europe, right?  Sure.  Why not?  So take Iowa.  There's nothing going on in Iowa.  They're closing down most of the east side so these guys can get around.  And they go, oh, the FDR is going to be closed today from 1 to 5 or something like that. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, that's all.  Just the FDR?  Just the main travel route on the east side of Manhattan?  That's it, right?  Manhattan.  So you've got Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  So now you've got to get off of that and now go on the streets that have lights every  10 feet instead of a highway that everybody uses.  And even with that road open, it's just a nightmare to drive around with.  That's what I'm saying.  On a good day, it's a nightmare.  And now all those cars have to be on the side streets.  Right, exactly.  So I make my escape.  You might actually hear the last hour of this show me calling from my OnStar system on my 
[00:16:00]  Escalade.  That's not a bad idea.  We should do that today.  My Escalade.  I call it the Escalade.  Sometimes you can be hilarious.  Love it.  Love it.  Pull the Escalade around.  You really have an Escalade?  Of course I do.  Yeah.  Look at me.  Wow.  I'm Italian.  It's the law.  Gotta have a Caddo.  I got the black ones, of course.  Really?  Black Escalade.  Good for you.  The brothers.  That's why I drive in early in the morning and I stop at a light. 
[00:16:30]  I look around because the brothers love Jack and the Escalade.  Love it.  Oh, you know that retro thing.  Oh, back to Bartlett.  But the people of Verizon should know that this guy, Clay, M-U-N-E-T-O-N, he worshiped  that he's a retail sales representative at the Verizon store on Steinway Street.  They're crossing the parking lot or whatever the hell it is.  And he's a keeper.  Oh, the kid is great.  He's a keeper.  Did he buy an acre out of the way? 
[00:17:00]  No, he didn't.  They're going back to him.  Imus is always on the brink of just losing his train of thought.  He's constantly, like, almost breaking down every minute.  So he's got to end it with some stupid shit.  I don't know what it is.  Some crap.  And then he figures it out last second.  Last second.  He gets it all together.  He pulls it all together and can actually do it.  I'd love to see him try to read to inner-city school children.  A cat in a hat had some stupid hat deal or something. 
[00:17:30]  It's like in the 80s.  Well, because I'm always hammering somebody here.  I mean, there you go.  I spend four hours a day bludgeoning people, and I just wanted people at Verizon to know.  I pulled some.  It's constantly on the brink.  I guess we'll have the guys pull some of the good audio.  Is that up on opanthony.com yet?  No?  Okay.  Anyway, speaking of the traffic and the U.N. and all that, Bob and I were walking home  the other day.  We were walking together for a couple blocks.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  All of a sudden, all hell broke loose.  The sirens are just flailing, and you've got cop cars and SUVs and limos and town cars,  and they'd just come flying by us right through all the red lights.  They had guns, though.  I mean, literally, the windows open showing you, I have fucking guns.  That's what I was getting at, Bob.  Thank you.  Nice.  That was the punchline.  The big climax of the story.  The climax of the story was, yes, as this whole mess was flying by, all of a sudden, 
[00:18:30]  this SUV with the windows down.  Then, yeah, you had a Secret Service woman.  You could tell she was Secret Service just staring at the pedestrians on the sidewalk.  It was actually Sandra Bullock.  And then in the back seat, you had these guys just armed with, I don't know, the heavy-duty  stuff in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Mac Daddy weapons.  The ones with the little pole, instead of the little pole with a thing for your armpit.  The shoulder stock that pulls out.  Yeah, it pulls out.  So they can hide it in their jacket.  Yeah, that one.  Rip it out and start letting loose.  Slinging lead.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  There you have it.  Let's see.  They stare you right down now, those son of a bitches.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Dan in Miami.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, I just moved down here, and you got these people on this oldie station, 105.9, that  I just am listening to, and guess what they're doing?  Is this gay?  I'm like, didn't I just hear this?  And it's two guys and this one girl, and the girl is, and you know, I never paid attention  to that, but you guys were nice enough to point it out to me.  This girl, I would rather drive an ice pick into my fucking temple than listen to this girl. 
[00:19:30]  She's the most annoying bitch.  Oh, a hole.  Yeah, it's just called the hole, sir.  That's what any girl in radio is called, the hole.  We really turned a lot of people on to the hole, the hole concept.  I actually now search out other radio shows just so I can hear the hole and laugh.  You gotta hear the hole.  And then you laugh uncontrollably because you realize, wow, she has absolutely nothing to  add to the program.  Would I be the hole today?  You today are the hole. 
[00:20:00]  Guys.  Guys.  You certainly are the hole.  It's gotta be difficult to get acclimated to the show.  You know, Jimmy Norton is usually there on a daily basis.  And he's brilliant every day.  Big shoes to fill.  Of course.  Well, one shoe.  One shoe.  One shoe.  One huge.  One puppy padded arthritic shoe thing.  One shoe and a foot thing for his foot.  A foot thing for his foot.  Lest you be confused where it goes.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So anyway, Bob Kelly.  I was just about to say, yes.  Yes, exactly. 
[00:20:30]  Well, Bob is here.  Yes.  Yeah.  This is the hole that they want us to work with while Jim is gone.  So.  Ooh.  Yeah.  You know, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.  Shut up.  We're not talking about Marilyn Monroe.  We got Bob Kelly here sitting in for Jimmy.  No.  Hold on.  You're going to get us all in trouble.  This is what a hole sounds like.  That's exactly what she sounds like.  Well, you get your mind out of the gutter.  You can pick any morning show that has a hole.  And this is what happens. 
[00:21:00]  No formula.  It's a formula.  The men will be doing the heavy lifting, talking about stuff, and the hole will just be doing  this in the background.  You got to have to stop.  You know?  That's exactly what she sounds like.  We, uh, so, so Bob, Bob comes in.  Yeah.  And, uh, he's sitting in for Jimmy.  But you, you gotta, there's some, like, it looks very free form and like we're not doing  it, especially before the show.  So, but you gotta understand something.  Uh, you're a little too talkative in the office.  A little too talkative. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, in the office.  You're a chatty little Kathy in the office.  I said, I probably said five words.  Five too many.  That's a lot.  You know what we say?  We all go, hey, what's up?  Good morning.  And then we sink into our newspapers.  Our zones.  Our zones.  Uh, another thing.  We're getting another hour of sleep.  Yeah.  From six to seven.  That's pretty much what it is.  We just go into our newspapers, occasionally it's like, hey, you see this asshole on page  five?  Something like that.  We really don't need to pop in Bob Kelly, RobertKelleyLive.com. 
[00:22:00]  What was it?  Is that the website?  What was it?  Is it RobertKelleyLive.com?  Oh, my brand new website.  Right, your brand new website.  This morning.  Oh, yeah.  You sat down on the couch and RobertKelleyLive.  And the first thing he does, we're not even on the air yet, is plugs his website to  us.  We're trying to, we're trolling for material and we're supposed to go to the web and now look  at Bob Kelly's website.  No.  Guys, Anthony, I was just.  Jimmy doesn't do that.  Jimmy usually just bitches about something that happened to him.  You have to walk in and complain, fucking savages. 
[00:22:30]  I hate deli owners.  Yeah, something like that.  Make us feel at home like Jimmy's still here.  I thought you guys just didn't like me.  But no, no.  I was yapping a lot.  I was like, so.  Bob sits down and he's like, hey, you going to Dane Friday?  I don't give a shit what.  I said, and then I go, what, Rolling Stones Friday?  Well, I didn't even, I wasn't listening.  And then he's handing out bath robes.  I'm like, all right.  We'll just sit down.  Hey.  You know Frosty, right? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, we know Frosty.  He's got bath robes.  He's got Yankee bath robes.  Yeah, I got one.  You see these days.  It's a million dollar idea.  We get it, Bob.  Shut up.  Ten minutes to show time.  Ten minutes to curtain.  I'm reading.  I'm reading.  We're on.  He has a fucking dress.  Try not to trip me up with those big feet of yours.  And then you're like, you say what everyone says.  They walk in the office.  Man, this is early.  I don't know how you guys say this.  Yeah, we said that too.  Yeah, we haven't heard that one before, Bob.  I wrote that one down on the way here in the cab. 
[00:23:30]  We were saying that every day, Bob, a year ago.  Exactly.  He's probably walking down the sidewalk trying to think how he could fit in.  Wow, gosh, I don't know how you do this every morning.  It's early, it's early.  Yeah, Bob, yeah.  I love how that when you get a mic in front of both of you, you just become really honest  like a crystal ball.  But if you're not on a mic, you just clam up like two L.A. fat chicks.  We are such a pussy.  You guys are like, hey, Bob, yeah, maybe I might go.  Hey, I'll check out that website.  Sure.  And in your head, you're like, this fucking moron.  Oh, the whole time in my head.  Here's my address for my robe. 
[00:24:00]  Thank you.  Hey, dude, that's a good idea.  I do want the robe.  I might go to Dane.  What time is the show?  Hey, what time is it?  I'll meet you there.  Put it on the air.  What a shithead you are.  Don't even ask me, you tool.  Then I go to Bob.  Did you prepare anything for the show today?  Exactly.  Exactly.  You'll get nothing and like it.  I like to fit in with us, trust me.  Prepare.  You have a whole gaggle of guys around here. 
[00:24:30]  There are a lot of guys running around like mad men.  There's a lot of guys with two-button shirts and dirty jeans running around here.  I thought that they might be doing stuff.  They make us look very, very good.  Getting us material, sound clips.  So Norton's going to be in L.A. for what?  Two and a half weeks this time around?  Three weeks.  Three weeks.  Yeah.  So we're going to have Bob Kelly and a bunch of others sitting in that seat in the next  couple of weeks.  Yeah.  I think Bill Burr is going to be in tomorrow and Friday.  Cool.  We have Bob Kelly today.  And that's how it's going to be.  Right.  And during that period, Jimmy will be checking in a lot. 
[00:25:00]  So don't you worry if you're a Jim Norton fan, okay?  God bless Jimmy.  God bless Jimmy.  He's going to do great out there in L.A.  All right?  Hey, what's going on with the Wow Girls?  We've got to get that going on.  We were just looking at, and it is Whip Matt Wednesday, we were just looking at the  new Rate My Wows before the show.  Another website that Steve runs.  Yeah, I hadn't looked in a while.  Let's get Martini Steve in here.  Why not?  I haven't looked at Rate My Wow in a while. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it's up there, and I didn't look at it, so Opie was trolling it, and I figured  I'd take a look.  There's a reason I haven't looked at it in a while.  Let's just put it that way.  Well, I was looking at the new, because I see there's a whole bunch of different ways  you can enjoy Rate My Wow.  Steve, you should change the name of this website.  All right, so Rate My...  Yikes!  Here comes Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, man.  What's bad?  Well, if you go to the highest-rated Wows, that's pretty enjoyable. 
[00:26:00]  RateMyWow.com.  There's some nice Wows on there.  You've got a couple girls making Wows.  The first picture, two girls.  Very nice.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Wow.  People can vote, and...  That girl on the right has kind of a Carmen Electra about her.  She certainly does.  That's a...  Very, very nice.  I think Joey Silvera sent us those from a set of a porn shoot.  Very, very nice.  Oh, that's why.  That's what we deal with.  See, stupid me.  I'm thinking, wow, we have listeners that look like that? 
[00:26:30]  Slow down.  Well, the guy that's directing the video looks like that, and he can tell them to hold the  sign-up.  Yeah.  But then you go to maybe lowest-rated Wows.  Yeah.  This can be...  Now...  This is a picture of me with my tits out.  We wish.  That would be an improvement.  Is it worse?  Look at this one.  Yeah.  Look at the first one.  The first one is probably the worst set of tits I have ever seen in my life. 
[00:27:00]  It looks like moose noses.  It looks like, yeah, it looks like two moose were sharing some pudding.  That would be some...  That would be Mises.  Mises.  Yes.  With these nipples that are distorted.  You know, it's taking those guys who are watching a long time and decide if they want  to give Judge Roberts the job or not, Opie.  I guess part of the reason for that is because it's not just for the Supreme Court gig.  It's for the big chair, the chief justice, which would be like an intern applying for  a position on your radio program and thinking he was going to sit where you are, Opie. 
[00:27:30]  I don't know of any other job where you apply for the top spot right off the bat.  Like you fill out an application for busboy at Denny's and next day you're President of  the United States.  I mean, what are the chances that'll ever happen?  Again.  You'd think Judge Roberts would at least have to work his way up through the mailroom or  something and then get promoted later.  I wonder how the other justices much feel with this game show host looking guy cutting 
[00:28:00]  in line like that.  Clarence Thomas thinks it's racism.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg thinks it's sexism.  And Tony Scalia thinks somebody's going to be sleeping with the fishes.  Funny how I know about all those guys, huh?  You know why?  No.  Because it's a high court.  Highest in the country.  And they're so slow making their decisions, they just got to be smoking some chiva.  I know I have. 
[00:28:30]  And the way I figure it is, if Judge Roberts gets in, he'll be in there for a long time  because he's like 50 years old, which makes him the youngest chief justice in 200 years,  which I guess was almost as old as Chief Justice Rehnquist was.  Well, although he didn't look half as old as you do, O.P.  What happened to you, man?  And what's with that cowboy hat?  You look almost as stupid as Imus. 
[00:29:00]  28 after they are.  Craig Crawford with his new book, Attack of the Messenger.  Holy crap.  Imus is like hooking us up today.  Major exposure for the show on MSNBC.  MSNBC.  Imus is, he has what, Rob Bartlett playing Brian Wilson, but he has an O.P. and Anthony  XM Satellite Radio t-shirt on, one of the ones my brother made.  All right, anyway, back to RateMyWow.com.  We're in the section called Lowest Rated Wow.  We weren't going to put that section up. 
[00:29:30]  Initially, when Jeff and I put this up, we only wanted to expose the flattering ones.  And we got a flurry of email from the ONA fans saying, no, dude, you've got to put up the awful ones, too.  The last tits look like the Red Sox logo.  Where?  The two little socks, the first one?  Yeah.  Doesn't it look like the Red Sox logo?  The two socks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty good, bro.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Look at the fourth one across the top.  All right, let's check out the fourth one.  Similar. 
[00:30:00]  A lot of people hitting the site.  That's all right.  Of course they are.  Oh.  Let's see.  Well, they want to play along, Anthony.  Holy crap.  The worst.  How do you take your clothes off?  How do you take your clothes off and look at that?  How the nipples, what, what, is she up, what is she doing?  Where'd they go, right?  How did they get down there?  Look at how low they are.  How did your tits grow, like, downwards, like cones?  That is awful.  Oh, this one's really bad, too. 
[00:30:30]  Okay.  Which one?  The second row from the bottom, all the way to the left.  The second row from the bottom, all the way to the left.  The second row.  Oh, sorry.  And again.  Those aren't that bad.  Those are horrific.  I don't think those are that bad.  Look at where the nips are.  Stop it.  Well, I don't, the nipples look like they were made in a basement, but the tits aren't  that bad.  I've seen worse tits.  Oh, that's, that's too much.  Yeah, that's too much.  The last two pictures we showed. 
[00:31:00]  That's the only place you're going to see worse tits.  That's too much cleavage.  Way too much cleavage.  That's not that bad.  I didn't mind those.  I don't like little tiny ones with the nipples bigger than the tit.  There's a woman up there that has absolutely no boobs showing them on RateMyWow.com.  I mean, there's flat, and then there's something called, there's nothing.  Was it the redhead with the awful belly button?  I think she made, go to most recent.  Yeah, she's in the new ones.  Most recent Wows.  She could, you know, basically put her hair in pigtails and play, you know, 14 or so. 
[00:31:30]  She's one of those girls.  Yeah, she could.  Where is she?  It's coming.  Things getting pegged, I think.  Yeah, we're getting, oh, wait, there it is.  Let's see.  That's disgusting.  That is some awful tits.  This girl's nipples look like burnt hotcakes.  It does look like she's holding up two cupcakes.  Left on the griddle too long.  Someone smashed burnt pancakes on her chest.  Uh-oh.  Let's see.  Yeah, the site's just getting killed. 
[00:32:00]  I think I know.  Well, it's good to know we have listeners.  RateMyWild.com, another site that Steve runs.  The Gamma O girls are stuck in traffic.  Thank you, Ben.  Of course they are.  We'll be here by 8 o'clock.  Bah!  Come on.  I'm waiting for this picture to load.  Did it load for you, Ant?  No, I'm still, uh...  There it is.  Look.  I got it on my screen.  Looking at the heinous ones.  Oh, there she is.  She has absolutely no...  Wow, there's no boobage.  ...no tissue up there.  I think I know who this chick is. 
[00:32:30]  This is, uh...  Really?  You know, Brandon sent us this picture after he got done dropping a batch on her face.  Oh, what was she in?  A slap happy?  She was in one of his...  I think it's called...  I think it's one of his latest in his Baker's Dozen series.  Baker's Dozen?  Baker's Dozen.  That's wonderful.  Where he goes and gets 12 guys to just bukkake a girl, and I think she was one of the victims.  On the face.  It looks familiar.  I think I saw that one.  Really do.  Really?  Well, do we have our listeners sending in the wild shots?  Yeah, plenty of them.  Or are they all just porn stars from L.A.?  No, no, no. 
[00:33:00]  The porn stars from L.A. are the ones you're going to see in the highest rated ones.  Yeah, they help us out.  They spice up the...  Yeah, but there's actually...  There's one girl.  I don't know where she's from, but this one.  Yeah.  That's definitely a listener.  She sends in pictures all the time.  Who is that?  She's got massive boobies.  Yeah, she's got nice...  Hey, she looks like my mother.  That chick...  That's not even a chick.  That looks like Joey Butta Fuco.  And more girls are starting to show their faces in these shots, which is cool.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  I don't like the porn chicks.  I like the regular chicks.  If I know it's a porn chick, it takes it all out of it. 
[00:33:30]  Okay, we've got a very busy show.  We're going to take our first break.  Bob Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton today.  We've got the girls from Gamma O handing out WOW stickers all over New York City,  helping us out with our Whip Them Out Wednesday promotion.  It's an ongoing thing.  It's going to happen all year long.  It's WOW.  Basically, you get a WOW in your car.  If the girls see that, a lot of them out there will flash you as they drive by you, okay?  It has worked like a charm.  If you need a WOW sticker, send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  We get hundreds of envelopes every single day. 
[00:34:00]  Don't get impatient.  It's like fishing.  That's right.  You just put the pole in the water there, and you never know what's going to happen.  All right.  Also, Otto and George in studio at 830.  Ooh.  A cock.  Harry Reams in studio at 830.  Harry Reams is coming in?  The Harry Reams.  Harry Reams.  The porn star.  Legendary porn star, yes.  Harry Reams.  The guy from...  I won't know him until I see his balls.  From Deep Throat.  Oh, he's the Deep Throat guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Derek just actually performed the mime Deep Throat to remind you what the name was. 
[00:34:30]  That's kind of disturbing.  Is that the guy with the mustache?  He's very hot.  Back then, you idiots.  They all had mustaches.  Oh, that porno chick from the 70s, the one with the hairy muff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was hard.  Yeah, he had the big 70s porno mustache.  Right.  It was the 70s, and he was in porno.  Wow, that's a real star.  Yeah, definitely.  He's going to talk about Deep Throat again.  How did he get away with not getting the AIDS?  We'll have to ask him.  Any of those 70s guys get away with that. 
[00:35:00]  How did you not get the AIDS?  How did you not die of AIDS?  We'll have to ask him.  Ask him that.  Is he the one doing that reality show, too?  Which one?  I don't know.  You want to mime that one there, Derek?  Steve would, maybe Steve would know.  It's like, Steve!  Yep.  Yeah.  I love that.  You don't have to land.  Just tell him.  Sure.  This is a quick flyby.  Harry Reams, does he do a reality show with his family?  Is he the one?  No, Harry Reams is not. 
[00:35:30]  You're thinking about Seymour Butts does family business.  Of course, see?  Seymour Butts, Harry Reams.  Same shit.  Well, Seymour Butts is 20 years younger than Harry Reams, I think.  Of course he is.  How do you know this shit?  I know these things.  I just...  Fascinating.  All right, you're making us all dizzy.  We're trying to follow you.  Okay, off.  I'm going.  You're making circles above us.  There you go.  Bye, Steve.  It's this hybrid car.  It's nice.  I like that color.  It's a good color.  You see the...  It's either a Fuji or a Nokia blimp. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, the Fuji blimp.  It is Fuji, right?  Yeah.  You know what that's for?  I thought there was a sporting event happening.  That's the NYPD.  Really?  Keeping an eye on things today.  Watching things?  Keeping an eye on things yesterday.  Just a little blimp flying overhead all day long.  Just taking a look.  Taking a peek.  Yeah, that's...  They came...  I was in the Verizon store.  I came in Monday.  I went into the Verizon store up the street.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the whole store was taken over by those guys.  They just opened the door.  They line up at the door, three of them. 
[00:36:30]  They all have these little buttons or something.  They intimidate the hell out of everybody in the store.  Were they like Secret Service or something?  Yeah.  Security?  They were like Secret Service.  They all come in.  And then a few more guys come in.  And they kind of surrounded the whole inside of the store.  And then these three dudes walked in in the middle of everybody.  And they just surrounded them.  And I just left.  I was like, I'm not...  I don't know who this guy is.  There's about 120 world leaders around.  Each one of them have their own security force.  Right.  And the NYPD is out there.  What happened to these two?  Dude, I thought this was like an SNL skit. 
[00:37:00]  I swear to God, I thought this was fake.  Hero Father Saves Daughter.  Good morning, America.  When Grizzlies attack.  Are we taping this?  If we're taping this, make sure Travis brings this in.  Yeah.  Hero Father Saves Daughter.  Yeah, when Grizzlies attack.  Did it look like an SNL skit?  It certainly did.  The guy's laying down in some kind of lay down gurney.  Wheelchair thing.  He's got a patch over his eye.  One of those, one of those, I broke my neck halos on his head.  Right.  His daughter's next to him all patched up with a sling and she's in a wheelchair. 
[00:37:30]  He's got fresh bandages that look like they're still bleeding.  Yeah.  I really looked up and thought they were selling some old SNL tape or I don't know.  Something.  Yeah.  Or I thought it might have been I'm just doing a parody, whatever.  But it's no, it's Good Morning America talking to these two that got attacked by a grizzly bear.  Did you see that movie, The Grizzly Man?  You saw it?  No.  I asked you if you saw it.  I did see it.  Did you like it?  I loved it.  Somebody was telling me, it's retarded though, that dumb guy.  But they're pissed off that they didn't play the audio of him actually getting killed by the grizzly. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, they don't do that?  No.  It would have been the best part of the movie.  Yeah, that would have been great.  Basically, yeah, this guy that was filming grizzlies every summer, he finally gets eaten by one.  I said no photograph.  Because he stayed too long.  But he was psychotic though.  He thought he could talk to the grizzly bears, right?  Well, what happened was he usually would leave at a certain time because what happens, the bears he really knew would start hibernating, if you really need to know the story.  Yes.  It's still dangerous, obviously, but these bears would leave and start hibernating and there would be other bears that would take the place of these friendlier bears. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  They were a little more surly.  They're surly.  And one of these surly bears got him as the camera was rolling.  He was under the impression that...  He ate him and his girlfriend.  He was the bear's friends.  Yeah, he was definitely...  He thought he had some connection with the bears.  And, you know, it's all well and fine when they're being nice to you, but the second they turn around and try to bite you, there's no reasoning with them.  There's no chatting with the bear. 
[00:39:00]  It's the same.  They do that all the time with animals.  They're fine.  Like the shark.  You can stand right here and nothing will happen.  They won't...  Then he gets his calf bitten off.  99 out of 100 times, they're going to leave you alone.  And then you get a, you know, a Siegfried and Roy where the lion will go and grab you by the throat and shake you around a little because that's what they do.  Like a toy.  Yeah.  What pisses me off is, all right, this grizzly bear that attacked these people on Good Morning America, right?  Now I'm sure they're hunting for this grizzly bear and now they have to kill the grizzly bear for doing exactly what a grizzly bear is supposed to do. 
[00:39:30]  It's tasted human blood.  We must kill it.  But, I don't know, I have a theory about the grizzly man guy.  He was gay?  Well, they kind of hinted to that in the movie.  Oh, really?  Bear fucker.  But he was getting eaten alive and his girlfriend's taking a frying pan and just slamming it over the bear's head and he's just screaming, save yourself, save yourself, leave, leave, leave.  And it turns out the grizzly bear not only ate him, but ate her as well.  Ate his girlfriend, too. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why didn't she just leave?  Can you imagine being eaten alive by a grizzly bear?  I guess you're thinking, you know, you feel a little guilty if you leave.  Here's my theory on the grizzly guy.  And I was waiting for more people to see the movie.  He was getting some fame because he was doing this every summer, okay?  He even ended up on Letterman.  He was getting a name for himself.  And he went out to L.A. to be an actor to begin with.  Supposedly he lost a part of Woody in Cheers.  No, what was Woody Harrelson's character?  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Whatever.  He tried out for Woody Harrelson's role in Cheers.  His name was Woody.  It was, right?  It was Woody.  Okay.  Yeah.  And he was a failed actor, basically.  And then he went off and started doing this type of thing.  And I think deep down he still wanted to be famous.  He started getting that fame.  He was on Letterman.  And that fame sort of went away because in the end no one gives a fuck that you're out  there with the bears filming him every summer.  Right.  He would go to schools and talk and show his latest footage.  And after a while I was like, yeah, whatever, dude.  It's, yeah, cool.  So it was more about him getting famous than it was any real research or. 
[00:41:00]  And I'm thinking, you know, then the psychosis is kicking in.  He's not getting the fame.  He's not getting the attention and the exposure that he used to get.  And I think he started taking some major chances at the end and thinking, you know, I hate  my miserable life.  Maybe this is the way I'll go out and I'll be known as Grizzly Guy that got eaten by the  bears.  Suicidal.  That's what I'm starting to think.  You think he killed himself?  He got eaten by a bear?  Suicide by a bear.  That's rough, man.  The guy was.  Who is that rough?  The guy was, you know.  He was crazy, but he was also a smart guy.  He did this for many, many years. 
[00:41:30]  Many, many years.  And he decided this one summer to stay, knowing that these other bears were going to start  moving in.  I thought he missed his flight or something happened that he had to stay.  I don't know.  No, because they have footage of him.  You know, he just decided.  No, he left and I think he came back, actually.  So you think your theory is that he, to kind of, you know, nothing's going down, let  me get.  Maybe get a little more exposure.  Maybe he wasn't planning to kill himself, but maybe at least get some aggressive footage 
[00:42:00]  or something.  You know what I mean?  Get something good.  Get the money shot.  Get something good where he could come back to the States and go, look what almost happened  to me.  Here I am in a tree as this bear is clawing at my, you know, my thigh.  Was he yelling, cut?  Cut?  Yeah.  But it was a documentary and they have the actual audio of him getting eaten alive.  And I'm thinking you got to go there.  You have to.  You got to go there.  You have to.  You know, people know when, you know, that you're going to see some sick shit when you  see some of these documentaries.  And they didn't even let you hear it. 
[00:42:30]  They just, they put a little text up on the screen.  One of the many women that he was kind of seeing here and there, old girlfriends and  stuff, they had her listen to the audio and they filmed her listen to the audio and she's  just losing her mind.  That was the closest they got.  And then the guy who was the announcer in the film dramatically pushes stop, takes the  tape out and hands it to her and goes, something like, you really need to just destroy that.  Destroy that.  The guy from Cheaters?  You really need to just, just get rid of this. 
[00:43:00]  Sounds like the guy from Cheaters.  You ever see that guy?  This is what he was doing.  They were holding hands.  Right.  And then they were in a parking lot.  I don't know if you want to see this, but here it goes.  They hugged.  I was into that Cheaters show for like a moment and then.  He got stabbed.  The guy got stabbed in a boat.  Oh, he did get stabbed.  That fucks up my theory because I thought a lot of that shit was set up.  But you're right.  I forgot about that.  He got a nice, he got a nice knife right to his gut.  I forgot about that. 
[00:43:30]  You're right.  He just desserts the rat.  He's on the thing, but he's still dramatic.  There's a knife.  Oh my God.  Did you see the footage?  I'm sure you want to see this.  You have to go there.  You got to show the.  Yeah, you got to show that.  You got to be able to hear that.  I mean.  Yeah.  Hear it.  It's like September 11th.  If they didn't show the footage of the planes, you wouldn't get the.  I get the same effect every time like it happened yesterday when I see that plane.  I'm like fucking dirty Arabs.  I think you're hoping it just veers off or something and it never does. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, right.  The same end result.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony was talking about the memorial in the fields of Pennsylvania.  Oh, this is infuriating.  I was trying to read the paper this morning while Bob Kelly was babbling incessantly about  his website.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Brand new.  Stupid robes.  Some people are checking in and saying, God damn, his website yaps as much as he does.  I really don't.  When you go there, it starts talking to you.  If you roll over stuff, like the MySpace button, it goes, MySpace. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, fat.  I get it.  One of those annoying websites that yap at you.  If you type on the email contact, it has a little baby going, Dear Robert, I think you're hilarious.  Stop selling it with the fake laugh.  I swear to God, it's great.  It's fucking good twice.  And then the links goes, links.  Were you all proud and happy when you checked out the website for the first time? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Thinking, wow, look at this.  The little kid sounds good.  That's a good one.  Let me check the MySpace button.  Click.  It works.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I'm going through the paper, and I see this article on the memorial down at the World Trade Center site  and all the controversy that's going on down there.  Was it past the tiny item saying that 80 died in Iraq yesterday?  That was another thing, yeah.  There was a little postage stamp story on page 14 that said, 80 people killed in bombing in Iraq. 
[00:45:30]  And it's like, that's a pretty huge story.  But we really don't care.  We don't.  And I'm just as guilty.  I thumbed past it, gave it a quick look before I really started thinking about it.  Who cares?  Boom, boom, paged right past it.  80 people dead.  That's 80 families that are just grieving like maniacs right now.  It's a bombing that killed it. 
[00:46:00]  We have soldiers over there.  And 80 people dead.  Page 14, postage stamp.  Because we just don't care.  It's far away.  If one person here died in a bombing, it would be a big story.  Front page.  Front page.  Sure.  80 people.  And this is on the heels of, you know, this past week.  I don't know how many have died, but you read all the time.  50 here, there's 25 there, 75 dead, blown up.  We just don't care.  But there are Iraqi people. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  And that's why we don't care.  There was 80 people.  That's one family.  They wiped out one house in Iraq.  Who gives a shit?  One car load.  One dude and eight wives.  80 Iraqis, the front of the New York Post today.  Katrina Killers, senior home owners, jailed in 34 deaths.  Yeah.  So 34 deaths of old people, much more important than 80 Iraqis.  But it wouldn't have been as important as maybe a bombing of three white people.  Three very healthy, young white people. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  That's huge.  So 34 old people trump 80 probably healthy Iraqis.  We are absolutely like this.  As human beings, as Americans, I guess, there is a bias one way.  Of course.  When you see that.  You ever see when kids disappear?  When you have a little blonde girl that disappears, it is all over the news.  Front page.  They're looking for this kid.  You know how many black kids disappear on a daily basis and you just never hear of them? 
[00:47:30]  It never makes the news.  Why is that?  They're black?  I understand that.  They're harder to find in the dark?  You can only look for them half the day.  Who wants to go to those neighborhoods and search?  Jesus.  There is definitely a bias there in the news.  Yeah.  Because the news splashes the young white children all over the news when they're missing. 
[00:48:00]  Well, I know we're jumping all over the place, but you're making a really good point.  It's all tied together with the news.  It's going to tie together to what we started with, because now you've brought up something  else that I've got to go to here.  This story.  What do you have to do to get on the front page of the New York papers?  Apparently not that.  We know all you have to do is have a couple have sex at St. Pat's Cathedral and bam, you'll  get all the front pages you want.  But this black guy, this story made page 12. 
[00:48:30]  This story should be on the front page of every paper in America.  Listen to this.  Man on fire leaps off the Tappan Zee Bridge and lives.  And his pals killed.  Yeah.  Basically, they're on the bridge.  A man engulfed in flames leaped 50 feet from the Tappan Zee Bridge yesterday to escape  a fiery, fatal car wreck and miraculously survived after being pulled from the Hudson River.  Yeah.  All right.  The accident, which shook the bridge for hours, snarling evening rush hour traffic, killed 
[00:49:00]  the driver of a disabled car that was rear-ended by a big rig, sparking an explosion.  Big rig hits this car.  Boom.  Goes up in flames.  There's two guys in the car.  One guy's trapped.  The other guy gets out.  He's on fire.  He's on fire.  He's like, holy fuck, I'm dead.  Yeah.  Who has a fire extinguisher in their car?  So he decides, wait a minute, I'm on a bridge.  There's water below.  A lot of water.  I'll take my chances.  He jumps 50 feet.  He survives the jump. 
[00:49:30]  The fire is put out.  Yeah.  Now he's just hanging out in the river waiting for someone to rescue him as he's floating  down the river.  The workers rescue him.  Boom.  Page 12.  Now he's in the hospital.  He's alive.  Page 12.  Page 12.  This guy's face should be on the front page.  Wow.  That is some...  Is that quick thinking or just reflex?  It's scratch and wind is on the front page.  Yeah.  I think that's just scratch and wind.  It's up to 250,000.  That's just...  To answer your question, that's just reflex, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're like, oh my God, I'm on fire. 
[00:50:00]  I see water.  I don't give a fuck how far down that is.  Yeah.  I'm going for it.  He's lucky he wasn't mid-span on the Tappan Z.  You know how high that bridge is?  Oh, yeah.  He was down at the end, I think, when it starts getting where you just have those cement little  things holding the bridge up.  He jumped off and then they looked over and he was like, can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  And then he went, ta-da!  The aristocrat.  You know, I find it hard to dig up sympathy for that car because you know how much traffic 
[00:50:30]  there probably was with that disabled car sitting there?  And I've seen it before and I've said, I hope they get hit by a tractor trailer.  And they're burning.  They go on fire and have to jump.  You probably drive by and go, good, okay, that's fine.  He's burnt up.  You see a little brown skull.  Okay.  A great quote.  Who jumps that far on fire and is still alive?  Yeah.  That was one of the guys that rescued him. 
[00:51:00]  Jimmy Curran was a hero yesterday.  But it's a black guy, so ah!  Yeah.  Page 12 is good enough for that story.  Not as important.  Not as important.  Like, what paper was this again?  Was it the Post or the Daily News?  It must have been the Daily.  Yeah.  It was the Daily.  You sure?  Yeah, I just looked at the Post.  What did you say?  Page 12?  Yeah, hold on a second.  That's a huge story.  Let's see.  Yeah, it was page 12.  So what was important to be on page one?  Well, the Democratic runoff for the mayor in New York City. 
[00:51:30]  Somebody threw a Yorkie terrier out a six-floor window.  That's crazy.  Your little Yorkie died.  But it was owned by a white guy.  That's a good one.  Yeah, we'll get to that story in a little while.  And Donald Trump was talking at some kind of, I don't know, I don't know, he lectured about  how real estate is good.  That made page three.  All right.  Anyway.  Yeah.  So getting back to the, so the Iraqis, 80 die, that's deep, deep, deep in the paper. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  You got the 34 old people that died because the owners decided to not accept the buses  that the city offered them or something to evacuate them.  Yeah, they were given plenty of time to, they just thought it was too much of a hassle.  Yeah.  Yeah, too much of a pain in the ass.  That's a hurricane.  What are we going to get all these people out of here and then have to bus them back in?  What a pain in the ass.  Screw it.  It's just going to be a little rain and wind.  Yeah, we don't need buses.  We'll just throw up some paneling. 
[00:52:30]  We'll be fine.  Yeah, that's all.  Everything will be fine.  And then they, they fleed and 34 of their, uh, of their, uh, oldies there, they, they  died.  They're charges.  Dead.  Dead.  Should have told them they were going to New Hampshire to see foliage, the leaves.  We're going to New Hampshire.  We're going to go see the leaves change.  Get on the bus, you son of a bitch.  Well, they, uh, they died horrid deaths in this, uh, old folks' home.  Just a bunch of whining.  You know, the winds whistling through the window.  Oh, my God.  It's so chilly in here. 
[00:53:00]  What the hell is going on?  It's chilly and damp.  Burgess, shut the window.  There were old people trying to pile tables up against the windows, uh, to keep the, uh,  water and, uh, wind out.  Uh, one old guy, they found him wrapped in a shower curtain.  Like, that was going to do it.  Really?  Really, just, they died horrid deaths.  Some of them laying on their beds when the water just came up and drowned them.  Jesus.  Because they couldn't move.  And these, this couple that owns the place just high-tailed it out of there.  And now, you know, one day you're in charge at an old folks' home. 
[00:53:30]  You never think anything could really happen that's going to send you to prison.  And then the next, there you are.  Up on 34 counts of murder.  I don't think it'll stick, to tell you the truth.  That's a real tough case right there.  They can say that their own lives were in danger and blah, blah, blah.  I think they're fine.  But, they're white people.  That's right.  They are white people.  And a lot of the people in their care were black people.  That looks like the same person on the front.  Just looks like the guy in drag. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, it's a little weird.  It's like, uh, yeah.  Well, you nailed it.  Very good.  It's kind of weird, right?  Uh, so, getting back to the memorial in Pennsylvania as we wrap this all up here.  Well, there was an article.  Holy crap, you showed your face.  Why are they showing our website?  What is he doing today?  He's going to, uh...  That's very nice of Imus.  Imus is giving us a huge commercial today on MSNBC.  Now, they were going to commercial, and they had a shot of a computer screen, and it was  the Opie and Anthony website, opieandanthony.com. 
[00:54:30]  That is fucked up, man.  That is weird, right?  He is a friend.  I met him a couple years ago, and we just hit it off.  Was it that long ago already?  Um, yeah.  Was it?  No, uh, a year and a half ago, I guess.  The i-man.  I guess it was a year and a half.  You're right.  And, uh, well, I was reading, uh, about the memorial.  You know, they have all these problems, uh, at the World Trade Center site with the memorial,  because a lot of people are getting their paws involved.  What should be there is a memorial to the people that died there. 
[00:55:00]  That's it.  A big memorial to the fire, police, and the people in the building.  Uh, I know the fire department wants some type of separate recognition for the firemen.  Absolutely.  I think they should get that.  There should be a few memorials down there for the people that died that day.  What they want to do, and what a lot of these liberal groups that are coming in there,  and interest groups that, uh, uh, want to have their hands in this memorial,  is make it, uh, uh, the big picture memorial. 
[00:55:30]  They want to put something there that identifies the plight of everybody fighting for their freedom,  including American Indians, Tibetan monks, uh, African Americans.  So they want to put this huge thing, this museum for peace, down at the Trade Center site,  as a tribute and memorial to the people that died down there.  How?  Muslims, too.  It's probably something with Muslims, yeah.  Absolutely.  Why can't you just pay tribute to people that lost their lives there that day, 
[00:56:00]  and the heroes that gave their lives trying to save other people, uh, as they did their job,  the fire department, police.  Because we have to include everybody now.  Right.  That's the world we live in.  Because everyone's got to get their hands in there.  All these interest groups feel that they're entitled.  There's this entitlement that goes on.  So now, uh, that's up in the air.  What they did do is they went ahead with this tribute, this, uh, memorial down in Pennsylvania,  where, uh, where, um, the, the flight, uh, what was it? 
[00:56:30]  93.  93 went down.  Um, what they decided on was something called the Crescent Embrace.  It's, it's these, uh, red maples in the shape of a crescent, which is...  A croissant or a crescent?  A crescent.  What's that?  It's a crescent, like a crescent moon.  Oh, okay, I get you.  Which is the symbol, like the cross is the symbol, uh, symbol of, uh, uh, Catholics and Christians. 
[00:57:00]  This is the symbol for Muslims, the crescent.  The guy that designed it said it's, it's there as a tribute and as something to heal, as a healing, uh, tribute.  Why put, to me, when I read that, to me, that is like having a swastika at a Holocaust memorial, as a healing thing.  Why on earth would you put the symbol of the hijackers, the people that killed all those people, 
[00:57:30]  and have that as the predominant symbol, not even predominant, just anything?  That shouldn't be involved.  But because these people get involved, Teresa Heintz and her, uh, organization, uh, put $500,000 toward this thing.  She's ultra-left.  Her organization, ultra-left.  And instead of just doing what they should do, these should be, as the article said, war memorials.  We were attacked.  Uh, people died, gave their lives.  It should be like a World War II memorial, Korean War memorial, just a memorial to the people that gave their lives. 
[00:58:00]  It should, when you see it, conjure up, uh, uh, anger, bad memories, uh, tribute to the people that gave their lives.  Not a healing thing.  That's not what war memorials are about.  They're so you don't forget what happened.  Yeah.  You remember that.  It's not about healing.  It's about, look at what happened.  Yeah.  Look how these people reacted.  Look, and, and, and to, to think they put this crescent there, the symbol of, uh, Muslim religion, is, it's an outrage. 
[00:58:30]  Because everyone's got to get their myths involved in these things these days.  Everyone.  Just a disgrace.  Bravo.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  Thank you.  Isn't Anthony great?  He is great.  That was beautiful.  I was, I was actually mesmerized.  He's very articulate.  Very upset.  You are mad, and they suck, and you should, you should, you should absolutely, right, you should,  when you see that, you should just picture, like, twisting an Arab's head off, just snapping 
[00:59:00]  the neck.  It's made of trees.  I would think it would burn down pretty easily.  That's all I got to say.  Good point, Anthony.  Good point.  All right.  I wanted to play the, uh, Jack Black song.  I couldn't find it, though, so.  Oh, is it right there?  Jesus, right in front of me.  Nice.  Thank you, fan.  You're welcome.  We got a little sing-along from, uh, Jack Black as we go to break.  Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton.  Yes.  My space. 
[00:59:30]  Jim Norton is on his way to Hollywood.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Hollywood.  I'm looking forward to his, uh, first check-in.  It's going to be fun.  Yes.  It's going to be a very fun thing that we follow with Jim Norton.  I mean, nice and angry, I bet, right now.  All right, uh, Otto and George at 8.30.  Harry Reams at 8.30.  I think when we get back, we should talk about the Danny Bonaduce show, man.  Holy crap.  I wasn't going to give this thing a thought, but I saw it on VH1 last night.  It's crazy.  It's awesome.  And we got some clips from the show. 
[01:00:00]  We'll go over the next.  Real quick.  Anthony, liberal groups don't want that.  Conservatives want it to be dedicated to freedom in general.  It's propaganda.  The liberals are protesting against it.  Stop it, Joe from Jersey.  Stop it.  They absolutely are not.  But I've seen the people that are for and the people that are against this.  And going along party lines, the liberal people are much more in favor of putting these general freedom museum things down at the World Trade Center site than the conservative or right is. 
[01:00:30]  And by the way, again, I think both sides are assholes.  Chris from Philly, Ann, I'm so disappointed that you're buying that crescent story.  It's a C-shape.  It has nothing to do with Muslims.  Yeah, and again, I've read that, too, as a kind of a cover-up.  Oh, it's a C-shape.  What does that stand for?  What's the C stand for?  Oh, it's a C-shape.  Really?  C.  Hmm.  Hmm.  It has nothing to do with it.  It's a crescent. 
[01:01:00]  The guy that designed it said it's for healing.  Stop it.  Could mean anything, though.  Could mean, you know, C.  Kumier.  It's for me.  It's for you.  It's Kumier.  Right.  Kumier.  My last name.  It's in tribute.  Stop.  And now someone's saying the family's picked the design.  My God, we can't go to break now.  We had a take on it and their own opinion, and this was really started up by a preacher.  Bill, Bill, Bill.  Were you talking the second the screener picked up and you haven't stopped?  Because we just picked you up, and you're in mid-conversation. 
[01:01:30]  Yes, I've been talking.  All right.  Well, you are just now on the air, like this second.  So everything you said, you were talking to yourself.  He thought we were talking to him right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, all right, Bill, you're on the air.  And that's my opinion.  All right.  Great job.  Sorry about that, man.  That's all right.  No, I just wanted to call and say that the Red Crescent was picked by the family members. 
[01:02:00]  I was the first responder on the plane crash, and I thought we were pretty close.  And they had a committee of all the family members and various other individuals of interest there,  and that was the design that they picked out of hundreds of designs that were submitted.  Yeah.  What were the other designs?  I can only imagine that.  A big turban?  Yeah.  Two swords together? 
[01:02:30]  No, no.  I mean, there was everything from, actually, statues of a plane going into the ground.  Well, that's a real nice.  Wow.  Who's going to pick that one?  There's a more subtle way to remember.  Right.  They should have little legs and arms screwed around on the ground.  Yeah.  Strewn all over?  How about that?  Thanks for saying strewn.  I couldn't figure out that word.  I said strewn.  A statue of a plane going into the ground or this statue of a turban.  Yeah.  Your choice.  Didn't in Oklahoma City, didn't they put a bunch of chairs? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  It's like their memorial are chairs, empty chairs for everybody that died there.  That's a little creepy.  Yeah.  I mean, there was a lot of designs, and I don't know that that's one that I would have necessarily picked.  You know what?  The best design ever is that Vietnam War Memorial, man.  Just names.  When you go down to Washington, that just says it all.  Names with a statue of the soldiers, that's fantastic.  You'll have a little piece of paper with a pencil.  Yeah, get a little rubbing.  It's not that fancy, and it gets the point across, you know?  But like Anthony said, those chairs in Oklahoma City, it's downright creepy. 
[01:03:30]  It is perfect.  It's something you could also, the family can take a little piece of it home with them when  they do those little rubbings on there.  Right, right.  And get the names of their loved one.  You could take that with you.  But a bunch of chairs.  The names immortalized up there.  Yeah, chairs are creepy.  It's kind of...  Well, it kind of works in that you...  Like the Vietnam Memorial, you get the sheer number of people that died, you know?  When you see over 50,000 people's names up on a wall, that's huge.  Is there that many chairs?  How many...  Every victim? 
[01:04:00]  No, how many people died in Oklahoma City?  I forgot.  Yeah, see?  183.  Are you sure?  I think he's pretty close.  Really?  I just guessed that.  I think it is kind of close.  I think it's pretty close, actually.  I didn't let you guys know.  I think it's...  I'm almost positive it's under 200.  That's 183.  I know.  I'm certain about that.  Some memorials are pretty good.  Some...  Yeah.  All right.  But Pennsylvania, I mean, stop.  You know?  What?  It's a...  Why a crescent? 
[01:04:30]  What's that?  Why a crescent?  I don't know.  I didn't pick that design.  That was just...  The design itself is supposed to surround the actual impact site of the plane crash.  And I think that's why, in order to highlight that area, but...  What a big, granite statue of Mohammed Atta.  And then there was a lot of bad ones.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  But, I mean, you know...  Thanks for being there. 
[01:05:00]  You helped me get through my days.  All right.  We appreciate that, Bill.  Let's say hi to Sal in D.C.  I guess Anthony hit on a little...  Oh.  ...hop button.  Sal?  Sal, go ahead, Sal.  Hey.  I just wanted to ask Anthony why he's so quick to blame all of the Muslim population.  Oh, that's what I did?  Wow.  Could I...  Derek, get that tape for me for later on, because I want to hear when I actually blamed  all Muslims.  Well, you did.  You didn't say it directly, but you did in a way that you... 
[01:05:30]  When you said they're putting the crescent up, and that's the symbol of the Muslim population.  Right.  But that's just wrong to do that.  It is.  Well...  It is, because the people that killed all those people on that day were all Muslim, my  friends.  It wasn't their symbol.  They are not representing the Muslims.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  They are doing a better job of representing them than the peaceful Muslims are coming  out and speaking against this.  How are they doing a better job?  Because they're able to be on the front page of the newspaper? 
[01:06:00]  There you go.  And because the peaceful Muslims are not coming out and speaking out against all of this.  Of course they are.  No, they're not.  They're in the media because of CNN and Fox.  They won't put them on.  CNN and Fox.  Polar opposites as far as their politics go.  But both of them are doing the same thing.  No.  They're not getting the representation and the media representation as the ones that  are doing the bad.  Sal, until Muslims really kick it up a notch.  You know something?  Maybe you're right, but I think they have to go above and beyond just being nice people, 
[01:06:30]  some of them, and really speak up against all these atrocities that are being committed  in the name of the Muslim religion.  I don't care if all Muslims are nice and a small percentage are bad.  The fact that a few of them killed so many people should negate any symbolism of that  religion being put at one of these tribute memorials.  I agree with you that they need to kick it up a notch, but unfortunately it's not that  easy as you make it sound. 
[01:07:00]  There are programs, there are newspapers, there are internet.  They do report on what the good things that the Muslims do.  Did you read that there was over $3 million that was donated by an Islamic fund to the Katrina?  Yeah, yeah.  Something tells me that's racially motivated.  $3 million isn't that much.  We gave $200 million when a tsunami hit.  Hey, how much did they give to the World Trade Center victims?  They did.  An Arab prince tried to, but Giuliani wouldn't take it. 
[01:07:30]  Good for him.  Good for Giuliani.  Don't want your blood money.  Don't want your blood money anyway.  That filthy money.  Who's on those bills?  Put it back in your turban.  All right.  I like his show, but I just wanted to comment on that.  Are you Muslim?  You've got to be devil's advocate.  God damn, we thought we could talk about the Muslims.  We didn't think he had the satellite radio.  That's exactly what he was being, the devil's advocate.  We thought we were all brave.  We didn't think the Muslims had the satellite radio.  We thought we could just speak with our mind. 
[01:08:00]  How could they have that in a tent in the desert?  Woo!  Try to tune it in.  On the back of the camel?  They have the...  You know, Joe Hollander or Lee Davis.  No, well, Hollander is the head of a media company.  No, it's not.  And Lee Davis is the head of FAM.  Well.  So what does that tell you?  Well, not everybody can be Joe Hollander or Mel Carmosan or those kinds of people.  The old age are orgores.  There aren't that many places to go. 
[01:08:30]  Not that many jobs.  Not enough of a weasel, that's why.  Who?  Mark Chernow.  It's a way...  You know, that's a very good point.  Excellent point.  It was...  He opened his shirt up more so he could see the O&A logo.  Well, you don't know him for that long.  Yeah, I've known him a long time.  Well, you know, obviously, he's been a big guy.  No, no, no.  I knew him when he was a salesman at NEW 500 years ago.  And he means that literally.  No, he was never a weasel. 
[01:09:00]  He may be...  You said he was a salesman.  No, but he may be a mutant practically himself in this business.  Because he's not.  He was an aberration.  I'm listening to Rob Bartlett play Brian Wilson.  He's wearing an open-ended t-shirt on Imus this morning.  But, boy, I'll tell you, he really is.  He has many, many rodent-like qualities.  Oily ferret.  An oil?  Yes, that's even...  See, Charles, that's why I love you.  He's an oily ferret. 
[01:09:30]  You're absolutely right.  Well, send the oily ferret down in my office.  Where's the O.F.?  It's nine minutes at the hour.  We're going to go to Peter Alexander.  All right.  God, Imus is just promoting our show big time today.  That's incredible, man.  Love the I-Man.  I don't know.  I guess he's trying for a golden ticket or something.  I want a golden ticket.  I've got to get out of here.  We'd have him on XM in a second. 
[01:10:00]  That'd be great.  In a second.  Phillip in Georgia.  Still trying to take that break.  Phillip, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Calling the representative of the Midwest.  You guys are talking about the memorials and talking about how Oklahoma City is pretty creepy.  But let me tell you, creepy is much better than what's going on up in Pennsylvania.  You walk in that place and there's not a dry eye in the place.  Yeah.  You're talking ten years after it's happened.  I mean, it's intense.  And it's something you guys should get out and see. 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to let you know.  I get too depressed at things like that.  God, it creeps me out.  I understand and everything.  You know what?  I accidentally trotted into a Holocaust memorial one day.  Oh, was that in Boston?  In Boston.  I love how you could just be walking down the street and all of a sudden you're in the  middle of a Holocaust memorial.  What happened?  I was going to a Sox game.  I was with you.  Anthony and I and a bunch of us, we were at one of the oldest bars in America.  Yeah.  The Oyster Bar or something.  I don't know.  There's a bar.  Right over there at Faneuil Hall. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Down there.  They're claiming to be the oldest bar in America.  This thing is awesome.  Yeah.  And we have a nice buzz and we're shucking and jiving and eating clams.  Were we shucking and jiving?  Well, I was thinking of clams and stuff.  So we were having our share of clams and we were getting drunk and we're all happy.  And now we're walking, I think, to go see comedy or something.  Yeah, great thing to do as a prelude to a comedy show.  And we're stumbling down the road to some of these back streets and stuff.  And yeah, we come across this Holocaust.  All of a sudden you're right in the middle of names. 
[01:11:30]  But they have fog that comes up, too.  Right.  From the ground.  It's fog.  All of a sudden, shh.  Yeah, like we need to see steam at a Holocaust museum to get the feeling of what was going on.  Oy.  Yeah, you need to see.  Oy.  Oy vey.  Creepy.  It's awful.  I'm doing a lamb, a patetico.  I didn't want to.  They got to warn you before they.  Why are you shucking and jiving?  I'm essential to the water.  Like, what the fuck did I step into? 
[01:12:00]  I just want a few pints.  You don't want that.  It's like all of a sudden you're in a fun house or something.  All of a sudden you're in a haunted house.  You'd be scared because you didn't know you were going in.  That's what happened.  Honestly, I thought it was a bus stop.  Right.  I swear to God, because it's set up.  It's a weird structure that just is from nowhere, and it looks like it could be a bus stop.  I thought it was a mist for the heat.  When they first built it, though.  On the subways or something.  Yeah.  It freaked you out because they have the steam for some reason.  Yeah.  And it's like, you kind of look around like, is this a joke? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  It's just, they're shooting gas.  You're going to blow a girl's skirt up or something.  Because you're in the little thing.  Yeah.  It's like surrounded, and then it comes up, and it's like, you think they're gassing you.  Right.  They're trying to put me through what they went through so I can relive the experience.  Yeah, you're all of a sudden in a small spot because it's almost like a maze or something.  And then a gas starts coming up through the floors.  It's like, wow, this is a great tribute.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  And it's right in the middle of all the cool spots, Faneuil Hall, all that cool stuff. 
[01:13:00]  You're having a great time, and then you're just crying on the other end.  You're weeping.  Yeah, exactly.  I forgot all about that.  That's trickery.  Mike from Boston.  They tricked you into going to that memorial.  168 people dead in Oklahoma City.  Wow.  Robert, you almost nailed it.  I'm sorry, though.  You went over, so you don't win.  You don't win.  Price is right rules here.  We really should take our first break, huh?  Oh, right.  We were going to do that a while ago, weren't we?  I took a water pill yesterday, and I have to pee.  A water pill?  What was a water pill about?  You woman.  What guy takes a water pill? 
[01:13:30]  Are you bloated?  What are you doing?  Well, I went into the natural store up the street, and there's a little store.  Me and Jimmy used to go, when he lived in my building all the time, and we'd get juice.  Fuck.  And wheatgrass, and I was a little bloated.  I've been bloated.  There's something wrong with me.  Where, like, my jeans, I bought these jeans, and they fit when I got them.  Then I get home, and for two days, they didn't fit.  I almost returned them, and then the bloat went away, and then they fit again. 
[01:14:00]  The water pill is not going to take care of the problem that I'm looking at in front of you.  How about a few sit-ups with your water pills?  How about the not-eating pill?  A water pill would sooner fix the levy than get rid of the water in you, my friend.  Well, I have to work on the emotions.  I walk in, and now, do you have water pills and a really in-shape black eye that can help me?  No, I went in.  I had a water pill in a salad. 
[01:14:30]  Who are you kidding?  Well, I am a little chunky, but there's a difference between being chunky, but then there's a certain point where you get bloated.  You know when you push your stomach out, you pretend you're pregnant?  How big can water make you?  Exactly.  It's not like you're...  All right, look at this.  Look, look, look.  All right, look at this.  Don't show us...  What are you doing?  I'm not going to show you my belt.  Opening your belt.  Look, look at these pants.  They're very loose on you.  But when I bought them, they fit tight.  They were tight.  Had you eaten?  Then one day, I couldn't even wear them. 
[01:15:00]  They were just so tight.  But I took these water pills, and it kind of took the...  Look at these.  Look at that.  Look at that.  I've never seen her.  Look at that.  Look at that.  No.  No.  Look at that.  Why do you guys always have to show us your asses?  What's with that chair?  It must be the seat.  I don't need this for you, Jack.  Look at my bush fat.  Sit down.  You can always pinch an inch.  Sit down.  It's bush fat.  No matter how thin you get, you can always pinch an inch of bush fat.  I've never seen a guy with a 38-inch waist and a 26-length pants.  I do. 
[01:15:30]  I have a 30.  You know how awful it is when I go in?  I can have a 40, 30.  Do you have fat midgets?  I need fat midget size at the gap.  It's the worst.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  All righty.  Robert Kelly doing a very good job.  Check out robertkellylive.com.  MySpace.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's Jack Black.  We were going to get to this 15 minutes ago.  Yes, Steve?  A picture of Rob Bartlett and the Spread the Virus shirt is on opianthony.com right now. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  You got to check that out.  I'm just doing us a solid today on MSNBC.  Oh, there are several ways to irritate a lady.  You could mention that her act's gone out of style.  Oh, that's sure to get a nift.  It's bound to cause a tick.  But here's a little trick to go the extra more.  Give her just a little kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt? 
[01:16:30]  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a nice kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stunt if you go for the punt with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Now, a lady of grace will show utter distaste for a slur or a randy suggestion.  But if you call her a whore, it may do nothing more than make a subtle change in her complexion.  So give her a kick in the cunt. 
[01:17:00]  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a lovely kick in the cunt, eh?  If you ain't to annoy, there's no better fly than a rousing good kick in the cunt.  Now, you might want a sucker or clopping your choppers, a sucker for making a rabbit and knuckles.  But she'll throw the coppers and you'll in the jail where you eat bread and water and shit in the pail.  So if you've enough of a womanly guff, no need to be rough.  It'll be quite enough to call her block with a huff and a puff to stuff your foot straight into the muck. 
[01:17:30]  Just an old-fashioned kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  A kick in the cunt?  As about an eye's kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stunt when you go for the cunt with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  I can't find a bra that will holster my massive hooter.  He's very proud of my big tip. 
[01:18:00]  Thanks God for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  When I went to the dentist yesterday on Long Island, I was so grateful that I had quit smoking.  Because I had very good teeth.  Good teeth, Jimmy.  Little Jimmy Norton takes care of his teeth.  I had still some staining from smoking.  Yellow staining, was that?  Yeah, from urine.  I don't understand what this one is.  I forget it.  Just, you know, wipe it off. 
[01:18:30]  You like chocolate keg a lot, don't you?  Oh my God, wow.  Your teeth are so clean.  Do you rinse with ammonia of some sort?  Because that really cleans your teeth.  But she told me I had great bone.  They do this weird test on your teeth.  It's really uncomfortable to get the x-rays.  They take like 30 x-rays of your mouth.  Yeah.  And then she puts this little thing and it goes,  Three, one, two, one, over each tooth.  They actually put a thing between your tooth and gums real quick  and they measure the distance to make sure that your teeth and gums are like, 
[01:19:00]  between each part of your teeth and the gums.  Yeah.  Why are you explaining something that everyone goes through?  You mean you've actually done that?  Oh my, everyone in their cars right now are like,  you're explaining a teeth examination.  You're explaining a visit to the dentist.  You idiot.  I've gone to many.  How long has it been?  A couple years.  You were explaining that, like, you're the only person that's ever been through it.  They take pictures.  They take 30 x-rays.  No.  He actually said it takes 30 x-rays and they're very uncomfortable.  Wow.  And they take this instrument and go, 
[01:19:30]  One, two, two, three, two, three, three, one, two, three, three,  I never had that before.  And then they take this thing, it's like a fishing line.  And they actually go in between your teeth.  Stop it.  No.  There's a small little toilet bowl next to me that,  The water goes down it in a swirl and you spit into it.  And they give you fluid, but they don't want you to drink it.  You rinse and they want you to waste this lovely beverage.  No, I understand.  Guys, it's really weird.  They start by putting a bib on you. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, stop it.  I'm like ready to eat, but it's really heavy and filled with sand and lead.  This isn't for food.  Why are you running out of the room?  I really don't take a good picture.  Oh, hell, oh, oh.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Mama. 
[01:20:30]  Mama.  Mama.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  I'm like, fine, whip them out Wednesday.  Yes, make sure you get a wow on your car if you want to see titties.  There are girls that will flash you if they see the wow on the back of your truck or car.  You can make a homemade wow sign or you can get one of our fine official Opie and Anthony 
[01:21:00]  wow bumper stickers.  That's right.  The Opie and Anthony wow bumper sticker.  Just send a self-addressed envelope to us here in New York City and we'll send out the wow stickers immediately.  I see a lot more of the XM Opie and Anthony wow stickers out there now.  When we first started, I'd see wow stickers and be like, oh, there's the old WNEW one.  Right.  Now, $15 plus a $5 fat boy surcharge.  Because there's more material to cover it up. 
[01:21:30]  It took me months to get mine.  Talk about this, Darren.  Well, we got it together.  Because Opie is Opie's crooked brother who's involved in this, right?  There are many t-shirts.  Many t-shirts to be had.  But, yes, his brother is a crook.  You're absolutely right.  Well, we have more serious things to discuss.  Let's go to the scene, McLaughlin.  Dudes, I can't express to the rest of the country.  Imus is just giving us one huge commercial today for SoundCloud Radio. 
[01:22:00]  That's so weird, man.  He just does this from time to time.  Know why?  We got to tell you.  We got to say it again.  We worked with Imus and we worked with Howard Stern.  Completely different people.  Imus just doesn't give a fuck.  No.  He knows his place in radio.  He knows he's had success.  He continues to have success.  He just doesn't give a fuck.  And he's got a great sense of humor.  Great sense of humor.  Anthony does one of the best Imus impressions I've ever heard in my life.  Thank you.  And when Anthony does his Imus, he just kills him. 
[01:22:30]  Destroys him.  Makes him look like a complete fool.  Imus laughs and told me when I met him how funny it is.  He doesn't give a crap.  But you pick on Howard and he goes running.  Runs to Mel Karmazin.  Surprise to the bosses.  Make them stop.  Make them stop.  You know what's weird though is in Howard's movie he makes Imus look like a psycho.  Like just a dick.  You know how it is to watch that scene in that movie knowing what the absolute truth is?  That Howard is a prick and has done more to try to keep radio people down, especially in his company, the same company he works for, than Imus ever did. 
[01:23:00]  Like Imus gives a shit.  Imus was a friggin' legend back then in those days.  Like he gives a shit if the likes of a Howard Stern comes to work for WNBC.  He didn't care.  WNBC.  WNBC.  Mr. Imus uses characters. 
[01:23:30]  WNBC.  Like he cares.  And yeah, Imus has a great sense of humor.  And they have to be listening to our program on a daily basis because this just came in from Brian from Virginia Beach.  The Brian Wilson character on Imus wearing the Opie and Anthony's shirt was just talking about the difference between XM and Sirius.  He said, you know, XM has this thing called a MiFi and it's like, you know, an iPod.  And Sirius has one too and it's like the size of a refrigerator.  God damn. 
[01:24:00]  And Imus calling my brother a crook.  A crook.  Jesus.  Imus' brother has more products out on the market.  Selling his salsa.  Salsa and all sorts of shit.  His salsa.  You ought to sell it in a little Imus hat.  You know how sometimes the ice cream places, you could get like a Mets batting helmet full of ice cream or Yankees thing.  You just ought to sell that salsa in a big Imus hat.  And as far as my brother goes, he hasn't left his house in about ten years. 
[01:24:30]  Give the kid a break.  He's making a couple shirts to pay the bills.  That's all it is.  You could be crooked from your own home.  That's all it is.  He's making a few shirts.  He's a very talented, creative artist.  I got an email.  Trying to make ends meet.  That's all.  I got an email from your brother the other day from Nigeria.  What?  He needs my credit card number, my bank account, because he's got $50 million he has to launder.  Are we getting some of this audio from Imus?  Because I'm just popping in and catching some stuff here and there. 
[01:25:00]  I'd love to hear the refrigerator line.  Yeah, I want to hear the refrigerator line, too.  Steve, you're nodding your head.  Yeah, what's going on?  We're getting audio.  Yes, we are.  You're getting audio.  All right, thank you, Steve.  That was brilliant.  Thanks.  You can leave now.  Well, he left his car in the garage over there at the production studio.  Oh, great.  That's just great for us today on MSNBC.  He might win the Assault on the Media contest.  I know.  It's really crazy.  I'm not even kidding, because we don't have anyone else that has done a really good Assault  on the Media this month.  And the contest is going to end in, what, two weeks, Ant? 
[01:25:30]  Mm-hmm.  We only have two weeks left in the Assault on the Media contest for September.  Every month, we're giving out some fine prizes.  I don't know what the prizes are this month.  I'll have to ask Ben.  But so far, no one's really in the lead, I don't think.  No one?  We've had some failed attempts.  Well, I guess the guys from Buffalo might be in the lead, but they were...  What would they do?  Well, you know, where you jump up and down on live TV with hoping...  No, no, no, no, I know that, but what do the guys from Buffalo's do? 
[01:26:00]  I don't really know.  They were that bad that I didn't even watch the video.  Yeah, it was a bad attempt.  Believe me, people, if you're listening to this, to win this would be really easy this month.  Yeah.  All you have to do is, if you had a WOW sticker and got behind a reporter and didn't say  word won and just held it up, that pretty much would win this month.  Right.  We've had nothing.  And we have a MiFi and concert tickets and all sorts of stuff we're giving away this month.  I just don't have the list in front of me.  Water, pills, everything.  We're running the gamut of prizes.  Oh, water pills. 
[01:26:30]  Water pills, yes.  The official Opie and Anthony water pills.  My brother will be selling them out of his basement.  One says O and one says A.  You have to take two.  He's a crook.  He's a crook.  I love it.  I love the old G-man terminology I misuse this.  Crook.  We all have brothers that are taking advantage of our fine success, Anthony.  Of course.  You know.  Mine's touring the country.  Yours is touring the country as a U2 band.  Yeah.  My brother's making t-shirts from his house.  And my brother. 
[01:27:00]  The house that he refuses to leave.  My brother's getting hand jobs from girls.  Is he?  Under the.  Wow.  What is he going to say?  My brother Bob Kelly.  Who?  Yeah.  And then just go, ah, he hurt my knee, man.  Hurt my knee, man.  So.  You know him.  I guess all the rules of the Assault on the Media Contest are up on opiananthony.com or  foundrymusic.com, somewhere.  All right.  All right.  We've got to move on to other things.  Is he here?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I guess that's him.  He's here.  Harry Reams.  Wow. 
[01:27:30]  I thought he was one of the executives here at XM Satellite Radio.  Want to get him in here?  He's in a suit.  Great hair looking all distinguished.  Why is he wearing a suit?  Because he's a, well, a suit jacket.  I'm not wearing a suit.  You're wearing a suit.  It's a suit jacket.  Are you going to play golf?  Now that's an idea.  Wow.  Wow.  You look like Judge Smales from Caddyshack.  All right.  What can I tell you?  I'm old.  No, that's wonderful.  You're not eight years old.  You're not old, bro. 
[01:28:00]  You just got the suit jacket that scared us.  That's all.  It looks like a million bucks.  That's Bob Kelly.  How you doing?  I'm just, how you doing, buddy?  Nice to meet you.  He looks like a million bucks.  That's Opie.  You really do.  That's up, bro.  He's pretty good.  Yeah.  And that's Anthony over there.  Anthony.  All right.  And that's Harry Reams.  So I got a Bill and Anthony.  Bob.  Bob Anthony.  Bob Anthony.  Opie.  Hold on one second, though.  Hold on.  Pass the bong.  I mean, I don't.  Did a wild, stupid Bill come with your Opie and Anthony t-shirt? 
[01:28:30]  No, I can't with the proprietary technology.  32 after the hour here on it.  Every time I pop up the TV, he's mentioning our name.  That's hysterical.  It's like one big commercial for this program today.  Harry, what's going on there?  Good morning.  Good morning, New York City.  Good morning.  A legend in the studio.  Yes.  I am thrilled. 
[01:29:00]  I just saw your movie recently.  Which one?  I hadn't seen Deep Throat since it came out.  Don't we have the clips from Deep Throat?  Thank you, sir.  That's why you look so awful.  I look awful?  Oh, you know.  I look awful.  People like me who see these movies, you know, we look like a million bucks.  It's inflation, my friend.  It's taking away on your million.  Keep it clean.  How, uh, we were wondering, how long were you in the porno business? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, I started in 67, maybe 68.  67, and when did you finish up with that business?  The last time I did was 85.  85.  How the hell did you survive?  With AIDS, pretty much, that was the real huge time where no one really knew about it,  but people were, you know, fucking.  We could use that word because it's satellite, my friend.  And, uh, uh, a lot of the porno industry, uh, was, was dropping dead of the AIDS.  So the question is, how did I survive?  How the hell did you survive?  Was it just a lot of the draw? 
[01:30:00]  Large quantities of alcohol.  You think alcohol is, uh.  Alcohol kills the, uh, the AIDS virus?  I didn't know that.  That's good to know.  I wasn't part of the lifestyle.  I mean, I made the movies.  Dr. Reams.  Most of the people, yeah, most of the people that were in the movies went off and partied  with drugs and booze, and after they finished shooting on a set.  Yeah, but you were having sex with them.  But you're having sex with these people.  Yeah, but this was before AIDS.  I actually didn't do a movie from 76 to 82.  No?  Not a, not a porno movie.  Right.  It was mostly over in Europe. 
[01:30:30]  And everyone knows AIDS started around 85.  Yeah.  I was actually.  About 85.  I don't know what you know about me, but I became a real low-bottom alcoholic, which is why  I have this voice, um, what's a low-bottom alcoholic?  Half a gallon a day.  Of what?  Vodka.  Half a gallon?  Yeah.  How are you alive?  That's the miracle.  I'm not even kidding.  Today, I'm 16 and a half years clean and sober.  I got a new life.  Oh, you got it.  You got to applaud that.  Everyone does.  It's just what you do.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  I turned my life around.  Half a gallon of vodka.  Yeah.  I found the rooms of a 12-step program, and that's all I'll call it.  But it taught me a new way of life.  Yeah?  I put God in my life.  I'm happily married.  I own and operate a very successful real estate brokerage.  That's what you look like.  You look like a real estate guy.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, you really do.  That's what I look like.  Absolutely right.  And I live in God's country.  Park City, Utah.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you get recognized?  Well, everybody knows me.  Really?  It's a small town of 7,000 year-rounders.  Is it Mormons?  A bunch of Mormons? 
[01:31:30]  Are you Mormons?  No, not up there.  No?  No.  The rest of Utah is.  That's why I call it an oasis in a desert.  Right.  Do you put your picture up on the real estate signs when it's sold by, and then you put your  old 70s porno mustache picture up?  Nobody up there knows me.  That'd be cool.  I mean, they all know who I am and what I did, but today I'm a highly regarded real estate  broker.  Yeah.  And operate a good company.  So you started in 1967.  Yeah.  What kind of porno were they doing in 1967?  Back then, they were doing what we called loops. 
[01:32:00]  Ten minute, black and white, soundless epics that premiered at Kiwanis Clubs or something.  A lot of hair, right?  A lot of hair.  Everyone was very bushy and hairy.  Yeah, we all very good.  They had this huge mustache.  Yeah.  And then I'm Curious Yellow challenged the existing obscenity laws, came in from Denmark.  It was found not to be obscene.  So all the guys making those little ten minute films started to make feature length films.  They were what they called the stag reels before that, right?  The stag films before that.  Yeah.  And then there was the white coders. 
[01:32:30]  I Am Curious Yellow won because it proved it had, quote, social redeeming value.  So the American filmmakers always had a doctor.  And I played the doctor a hundred times before.  Yeah, you were always the doctor.  And I'd sit there and say, if you're having problems with oral sex, here's how you do it.  And it would cut to a stag film that was made five years earlier.  And then Deep Throat came along.  And what gave it its success was really that it spoofed the white coders. 
[01:33:00]  It had no pretense of having social redeeming value.  Yeah.  But again, you were the doctor.  The crazy doctor was me, and it was the first time we played him for comedy.  Yeah.  So that was the groundbreaker right there.  How did you get into that business, especially back then?  I was working in a theater here in New York.  Yeah.  I had worked at La Mama and WPA, Bleecker Street Theater.  I was doing a little stint with the National Shakespeare Company.  And I'm making $78 and change a week under an actor's equity associate. 
[01:33:30]  Was that good back then?  No, it was scale.  So another actor said, I know where you can pick up $100 and want it for one hour.  And I went and did it and never looked back.  Jesus.  I was a little repressed Jewish kid out of Westchester.  Wow.  So I did not have a lot of sexual experience.  Were you any good, the first one, the first movie?  We won't go into that.  No?  Well, I went into that.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  You didn't last that long, did you?  No.  Next.  Wow.  And then you said you turned your life around.  What was the bottom?  Because everyone's got the story where you had to.  Here's the bottom.  I was drinking excessively, to say the least.  And I was in place.  Were you always a drinker?  And then it just escalated, really?  It really started when I was on trial in Memphis.  I used to leave the courtroom.  You guys didn't do your homework.  We like to hash this out live on the air with our guests.  It's a little bit differently, sir. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  What's the trial in Memphis, though?  Let me back you up for a minute.  All right.  I'm here promoting the release of a documentary called Inside Deep Throat.  Well, we know that much.  It's both NC-17, and if you're shy, go buy the R-rated version.  But it's a look at the social and political and cultural changes in America from the 60s to the present.  Now, as far as the White House goes, the executive branch, there's not much change.  You had Richard Nixon then, and now you've got George Bush. 
[01:35:00]  But when you look at the changes in America, I mean, the 60s were a very volatile time.  None of you are old enough to really remember it.  But, you know, we had a sexual revolution.  We had women's rights movements, black rights movements, Freedom of Information Act.  We had all of this stuff boil up and change the mores from the 40s and 50s.  Yeah.  And that's when we started to wear long hair, call ourselves hippies, and screw around a lot. 
[01:35:30]  So this movie sort of spans that era, and it's very interesting.  I went on trial for 12 weeks with eight members of the Columbo family in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee.  I'd never been there.  The film just flew over the state.  It was forum shopped into Memphis.  And I was on trial for, quote, conspiracy to transport interstate obscene materials.  They were trying to hold an actor or an artist responsible for the distribution of their product. 
[01:36:00]  And what year was this?  The trial started in 75.  I got arrested here in New York in my apartment in Chelsea.  Three FBI agents broke down the door at four in the morning.  Wow.  Next thing I know, I'm on an airplane going to Memphis, Tennessee, and I find out that I'm being held responsible for the distribution of a film.  So I alerted the entire entertainment community.  Everybody about the issue.  They didn't necessarily back me, but the effects were chilling.  With an organized crime family. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, I was on trial with eight of these guys.  Yeah, wow.  They all were with the Columbo family.  They were the distributors of Deep Throat.  I didn't know it when I made it.  Of course, this was the pioneer days of porno in the United States.  They were the original distributors of that movie?  Yeah, and the producers.  Columbo Crumpf?  Yeah.  In fact, Linda Lovelace and the director, Jerry Damiano, were witnesses against me.  Wow, wow.  Can you imagine that?  I'm on trial for the distribution of the film, and the director, producer, and the star are pointing the finger at me and said, 
[01:37:00]  yeah, he had sex with me on film.  Give me a rest, man.  We didn't need to hear you.  You should have shoved your cock in the mouth.  Anyhow, they proved murder.  They proved tax evasion.  They proved, oh, they were beating people that took the money at the box office every night with baseball bats.  Wow, shake them down.  Shake them down.  And I'm on trial for these crimes.  All you did was make a movie.  Well, here's the conspiracy laws, and this is the broadest use of the conspiracy laws in the history of the United States to this day. 
[01:37:30]  Two or more people acting in conjunction to commit a crime, all right?  Hypothetically, you have knowledge the president's going to be shot tomorrow, and you don't legally disavow and destroy that.  You're now a conspirator.  You don't call the authorities.  You go on trial for murder.  So I knew the film was in distribution, but it wasn't obscene where we shot it in Florida.  It wasn't obscene up where I lived in Westchester. 
[01:38:00]  It was obscene in New York City, which I find curious.  Especially in 70s.  Yeah, so they were trying to hold me responsible for this whole thing, and it was really an organized crime trial.  It should have been.  They proved murder.  They proved brutalizing people.  They proved tax evasion.  They just wanted to bring a face into it.  There's a scene in this DVD where one of the FBI informants walks into this room, and this was shown in video at the trial, and he has a little camera in his briefcase, and he walks in this room full of money. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, loaded to the ceiling, and he turns to a couple of guys, and he says, how do you know how much is here?  He said, we don't.  We don't count it.  We weigh it.  Six hundred million dollars.  Wow.  Escaped the United States.  Never paid taxes on it.  And because I made such a furor, I made such a fuss over an artist, good or bad of any kind, being responsible for the distribution of his materials, the conviction was overturned when Carter took office. 
[01:39:00]  If the Republicans stayed in office, I'm in jail.  But were you convicted at first?  Convicted and sentenced to five years.  Five years on conspiracy.  Then I got Alan Gershowitz out of Harvard, one of the great First Amendment attorneys, and he said, keep this thing public.  So I did fundraisers all over the country with celebrities that came and supported the issue, not necessarily me.  And eventually the Democrats took the office, took the White House, and one of the first acts Jimmy Carter did was to overturn the conviction against me. 
[01:39:30]  He was a big fan of your movies.  Well, he's a big fan of freedom.  Overturned the conviction, and then dismissed.  That was the first order of business.  And then I had two other indictments coming.  Yeah.  One for Devil and Miss Jones, one for Memories Within Miss Aggie.  These were adult films back in the early 70s, and all of it got dismissed.  I find it interesting, and the DVD, which is both R-rated for the timid, and if you want to see the real deal, get the NC-17. 
[01:40:00]  What does the NC-17 include that the R-rated doesn't?  Clips of the movie?  Blowjobs.  Can you never do that sound again, please?  It was the creepiest blowjob sound I've ever heard.  But anyhow, here's the difference in culture in America right now.  Thirty years ago in Memphis, Tennessee, the federal government prosecuted me for the distribution of Deep Throat.  Convicted me, too.  I was in Memphis three days ago doing some press to kick off this. 
[01:40:30]  You know, I'm out promoting the release of this DVD, and it's great.  It's really good.  And I go into my hotel room, and it's one of the landmark hotels in Memphis.  It's called the Peabody Hotel, with the ducks in the lobby and just a gorgeous old historic hotel.  I get to my room.  I turn on the TV.  Right in front of my face, it says, when I went to the section for movies, they had three or four general releases.  They had about 50 porno titles, including Deep Throat, the original version. 
[01:41:00]  You go to the Peabody Hotel, folks, in Memphis, Tennessee, for $11.99, you can see that film.  Did you watch it?  I don't know if I really ever saw it from beginning to end.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, I did the movie.  I used to tell the producers, because I was in the actor unions, don't use my real name, which is Herb Stryker.  And so they made up names for me.  Dick Hurt, Peter Long, you know, all these.  Herb Stryker is a great porno name.  That is a good porno name, too. 
[01:41:30]  Herb Stryker.  But anyhow, on the movie Deep Throat, the name Harry Reams pops up.  Suddenly the phone is ringing.  All over the world, people are asking me to do movies.  So I kept the name.  But I find it ironic that today you can go into Memphis, Tennessee, and rent this.  Where you were brought.  One of the most conservative hotels and historic landmarks of the South.  Come a long way, sir.  Time does roll on, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  Go ahead.  Anyhow, this DVD.  Getting great reviews, by the way.  Yo, fabulous reviews.  It premiered at Sundance Film Festival, which happens to be Park City, Utah, where I live. 
[01:42:00]  I hadn't done press for over 20 years.  Since 1985 until about two years ago when this movie came out, I refused to do any press.  Everybody wanted the sex, the drugs, the rock and roll.  Well, you hawk like the best of them now.  Yeah, well.  You're good, sir.  These guys came along.  This is Universal Studios and HBO.  They funded this project.  Brian Grazer of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Academy Award winning producer, produced this film. 
[01:42:30]  And two great directors, documentary directors, Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, directed this film.  And I didn't want to do it.  And they just kept hounding me.  And I said, well, all right, well, what's your fix on me?  How do I fit into this story that you're going to tell about social change in America?  And they said, well, yours is a story of redemption.  I'm 16 and a half years clean and sober.  I found a program of recovery.  I turned my life around. 
[01:43:00]  My life today is better than anything I could have expected it to be when I was a kid.  So, you know, I'm going from station to station.  I'm losing my voice.  Want a shot?  Keep that in your...  What are you doing?  Don't use your teeth.  Early in the morning.  For Christ's sake.  A half a gallon of vodka.  What about the allegations that Linda Lovelace made, that she was forced to do the movie? 
[01:43:30]  Linda Lovelace was a witness for the government against me.  She wrote a book.  After she couldn't make a transition into more conventional movies and entertainment,  she joined the women's movement and wrote two books.  One called Ordeal, which says that she was forced at gunpoint to make that movie.  Right.  To make the...  I was the lighting director.  I wasn't even supposed to act in that damn thing.  Hilarious.  It's true.  But I had worked for the...  Hey, you.  How's your cock?  Come here.  Come here. 
[01:44:00]  Hold this light and do this.  I had worked for this director as an actor many times.  I had shot loops of these old stag films two, three years earlier with Linda Lovelace.  One or two of them are in the movie.  Really?  Yeah, they ran out of time.  62-minute movie.  You take out all the sex, you've got 11 minutes of me.  Who the hell wants to see that?  So, Linda Lovelace wrote this book, said she was forced at gunpoint.  I, being the lighting director, was on every single scene.  No such thing happened.  Look at the movie.  She's having a ball. 
[01:44:30]  Literally and figuratively.  She's enjoying herself.  So, when the women's movie dumped her, she went right back to taking off her clothes  and doing nude appearances.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  So, I turned my life around.  So, she was full of crap.  And you're now married?  I'm happily married.  How long have you been married?  I converted to Christianity.  I was a trustee at my Methodist church.  I opened a real estate brokerage.  How do you explain your past to your wife?  Because, you know, you get into a new relationship and everyone has baggage they've got to explain 
[01:45:00]  to the new girl.  She knew who I was.  Oh, she did.  We had met in 82.  And then we met again in 89.  I understand she knew who you were, but, I mean, that's got to play on her.  Like, oh my goodness.  It doesn't bother her.  She's an in-the-moment person.  Does she think, ah, that was just...  She doesn't care about the past.  That was just his past life that has nothing to do with us and what we're doing.  That's exactly right.  You're like a prize, though, for people that turn their life around and find God.  I'm 58 years old.  I am baggage.  No, you know what it is?  You look good, dude.  You look like you just won the Masters.  You know what? 
[01:45:30]  You really do.  You know what?  Looking good is everything.  It's not how you feel.  It's how you look.  It's perception.  So, you know, I combed my hair today.  I shaved the mustache.  I'm old.  When did you shave the mustache?  How long are you on?  My wife asked me to shave it off in the first year of our marriage.  Really?  Yeah.  You could have saved that in a jar and sold it on eBay if you knew eBay was going to be invented.  Next.  Imagine having his mustache.  Amazing.  Where would you put it?  Where would I put it?  I don't know. 
[01:46:00]  I'd probably put it up proudly displayed on a bookcase.  Sealed, of course, because it probably smelled like trout.  You read books?  You read books?  Occasionally.  Usually comic books.  One of the smartest people you'll ever meet, Mr. Reinhard.  Is that right?  Oh, yeah.  Is that right?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Recite the alphabet backwards.  I tend to pick out little things.  He's not a rain man.  He can't drop matches on the floor and he'll count them.  But he knows a thing or two about a thing or two, sir.  He certainly does.  Well, that's something. 
[01:46:30]  Turned your life around.  But you said in there during the trial you really started the drinking.  And then when did you hit bottom?  What was the thing?  Well, after the trial was over and I was convicted from 76 to 82, I didn't go near a porno movie.  And I tried to make a transition into more legitimate stuff.  I was hired to play the coach in Greece for Alan Carr in Paramount.  And about a week before production, they paid off the contract and said,  We're sorry, but we're losing play dates because you're in this movie.  And so the writing was on the wall. 
[01:47:00]  I wouldn't make the transition.  So in 82, I went back very reluctantly.  I got paid a fortune.  I got paid $120 for nine days' work, plus 10% of the gross.  And I did another porno movie.  And from 82 to 85, I did porno movies again, but not with the same joy I used to.  I was already in my mid-30s and alcohol was taking its toll.  The last movies I did, certainly I couldn't have sex, 
[01:47:30]  but they would carry me to a chair, put me in the chair, and I'd deliver three lines.  And a month later, a video box would come out with my picture on the cover saying another Harry Reams miracle.  Wow.  So I ended up in the ditch there in 85.  From 85 to 89, I lived in the streets.  I panhandled.  Are you kidding me?  Most of the time in jail or a hospital or a psych lock-up.  I had a doctor's appointment here in New York City.  I had eternal bleeding. 
[01:48:00]  I was bleeding from the throat, my stool, my urine, everywhere.  I had two ulcers.  Hot.  Like a water pill.  I was almost dead.  So I came to New York.  I was put in the St. Luke's Roosevelt AIDS ward, interestingly enough,  because it was the only hospital that allowed AIDS patients in, was St. Luke's Roosevelt.  I spent 32 days...  Well, they assumed you had it.  I did not.  They probably had assumed that.  No, no, they didn't.  They did all the tests.  No?  But there was a gastroenterologist, a stomach guy, who was wanting to study an alcoholic. 
[01:48:30]  So for years, I went back to him to dry out, and he kept me in for 32 days.  Friends, because I'm originally from New York, came to visit me.  And I had stolen and borrowed and, you know, pissed them all off over the years.  And most of them said, well, I'm not going to come back.  I don't want to see you die like this.  And before they left, I used to ask for quarters for the telephone.  You got a few quarters.  I need to make phone calls. 
[01:49:00]  Well, over 32 days, I had a lot of quarters.  I walked out of the hospital on 11th Avenue, walked across the street, bought a bottle of vodka,  woke up seven days later in Los Angeles County Jail.  To this day, I don't know how I got there.  That was my last drink.  That was it.  That was the first day I went to a 12-step meeting.  Why the jail?  Just because you were drunk and disorderly?  Public urination, drunk and disorderly.  Wow.  I used to buy cars, huge convertible cars like Cadillacs and Pontiac Bonnevilles, 
[01:49:30]  so that when I did, and it wasn't a question of if, it was when I smashed into a telephone pole,  I would live.  And I smashed up a lot of cars going through Topanga Canyon.  Nice drive, by the way.  So you were on 11th Avenue in New York City.  Correct.  And you end up in Los Angeles County Jail and have no clue of anything in between.  I don't remember most of 85 to 89. 
[01:50:00]  When I got sober, my sponsor told me, you have to make amends.  You have to clean up your past.  You got to call people, apologize.  You got to show up where you need to show up.  So I had a local policeman.  By the way, I was arrested the first time I walked into a meeting.  It was in the same building as the police department.  Wow.  So they had warrants out for me in Park City.  And I had that policeman pull up, an FBI or whatever they pull up,  and I had warrants all over the country, Florida, in South Carolina, in New York City, 
[01:50:30]  down on the island of Jamaica for some reason.  You had them pull this up?  Yeah.  And for that first year of sobriety, I...  So you can make amends.  Exactly.  I went to every judge.  I apologized.  I told them what I'm doing now.  And every one of them saying, keep doing what you're doing.  You're on probation for six months.  Get out of here.  Wow.  So that was my last drink.  You want to know where the bottom was?  That was it.  That's unbelievable.  Excuse me. 
[01:51:00]  It's a miracle I'm alive.  Truly.  I mean, if the voice is the worst thing that happened to me from the alcohol abuse...  I think it's kind of sexy.  I can live with that.  Thank you, sweetheart.  I do.  I like it.  A little...  It's kind of like Demi Moore a little bit.  Like, hey.  I kind of like it.  Wow.  Hey, Bob.  Watch it.  Easy.  That's something.  You ought to take an example there, Bob.  I've been sober for 20 years.  I just celebrated my 20 years September 3rd.  20 years?  20 years.  I swear to God.  He wants to shake your hand there, Bob.  There you go.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:30]  I did the same thing.  We had the same joke.  What's on my hand?  We both looked at him.  Good for you.  So you know what I went through.  Yeah.  Well, not...  You know, I was a lot younger.  I was in Juvie Hall.  I didn't just wake up places.  You get in a program?  Yeah.  Why did you stop drinking, Bob?  I went to Juvie Hall from like...  You know, I just got arrested again.  Was in jail again.  And again, and again, and again.  Yeah, I just kept going and...  Do you like envy people that can drink and just have a good time and not...  You know what?  Absolutely.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  I wish I could be a normal drinker.  Yeah.  Just so I can get a buzz on.  Doesn't it look like fun for most people?  But I'm the kind of guy you put a bottle in front of and I pour a drink.  I'm not thinking about the rest of that bottle.  I'm thinking about where am I going to get the next bottle.  The next bottle.  Exactly right.  I never drank on the rocks.  That's the one thing I missed.  I was young, so I was drinking beer and we used to take the cap off of whiskey and throw it away.  Oh, you stopped drinking when you were drinking like a kid.  Well, yeah.  You didn't even get to the adult with ice and a swizzle stick.  Yeah, I was drinking in a pot like a pint and just chugging it down one sip. 
[01:52:30]  Nice clink, clink.  Yeah.  I never did, you know, like three ice cubes.  Uh-huh.  Pour it over, let it sit.  I've never did that.  In fact, I'm going to go do it right now.  Yeah, you should.  20 years is a long time.  I'm not a drunk anymore.  Hang on, I'll be right back.  So after so many years, you still would like to have a drink, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  You still have the urge?  Well, I don't have the urges and the obsessions anymore.  Smoke a little weed?  But for the first year, no, nothing.  Nothing.  For the first year, you know, I had to like tie myself up, sit in my hands so that I wouldn't go out and drink. 
[01:53:00]  And I got a sponsor in that program and I was taught to find God in my life.  I mean, I hate to get hokey about this.  That worked out for you?  It worked out great.  Yeah.  It works out for me.  It worked out great.  You know, I'm happily involved with a Methodist congregation.  That's what I'm saying.  They must hold you up like, oh, look at this.  You are their golden boy.  Wow.  Because they like when anyone comes to church, comes to church out of somewhere.  But usually it's a story, you know, I had a bad marriage, something like this. 
[01:53:30]  When you can pull up a Harry Reeves and say, look at the redemption we've done here.  His mustache is gone and the Lord is here.  They parade you around, right?  Well, anyhow, I met a wonderful woman.  I married.  I got a real estate license, not knowing I never sold a thing in my life.  And you're successful with the real estate business?  Hugely.  Really?  Yeah.  That's awesome.  There's about 600 realtors in my community.  I'm always in the top 10.  Yeah?  Top five.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a great story.  See, I'm glad I didn't read a bio. 
[01:54:00]  That's a great story.  You changed.  But you changed.  It sounds like you changed the way you talk and the set.  You're kind of like.  I got one for you guys.  You ought to take this.  You ought to practice this.  Ready?  I used a lot of profanity when I was younger.  I certainly used a lot of it when I was drunk.  So my first sponsor said to me, go buy a roll of quarters.  Put it in your right pocket.  Every time you use a profanity, put a quarter in your left pocket, and then when you go  to a meeting tonight, dump the whole thing into the kitty. 
[01:54:30]  Well, in three days, I wasn't using profanity.  I was out about 60 bucks.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you talking about?  I've never used profanity anymore.  But you've still got a roll of quarters in your pocket.  At least I think.  It's looking like dimes today.  But you can't.  You can't.  You can't.  You don't like swearing.  You don't like swearing.  You can tell.  He's a religious man now.  Yeah.  No, I'm not religious.  I'm not religious.  I enjoy a curse.  You know what I do on Sunday now? 
[01:55:00]  Huh?  I play golf.  Yeah, I go to the Church of the 18 Lynx.  There you go.  I play golf, and I say a prayer.  Do you still enjoy the sex?  What?  Do you still enjoy sex?  I'm not going there.  No, he's not going there.  You know, when you think you hear Harry Reams saying something like, I put it in the hole,  you would never think he's talking about it as a Sunday golf game.  On this day and age, it's a lot different than the seven days and age.  He said it nice, though.  He didn't say, you know, you said it nice.  No, that's all. 
[01:55:30]  That's all I'm saying.  You still, because that is an interesting fact that you did change your life around.  Well, you did, too.  Well, I did, but I'm still a sexual creep.  He's still a pervert.  I need to work on that.  You know what I mean?  He said you work on it.  Yeah, but, I mean, you're talking to a guy that...  For 20 years, it'll be all over for you.  Oh, yeah?  20 years?  Harry...  I'm 58.  I haven't thought about sex.  No Viagra, Cialis.  Harry, out of respect for you, I'll say it this way.  The man you're looking at right now, he used to get off by effing sinks.  Well, he would lay on the sink in the hotel room.  I can make you a star. 
[01:56:00]  Really?  Yeah, you are.  You want to make a movie?  Sink fart.  You put a mustache on me?  I can make a movie.  You want to make a movie?  Yeah, so...  Wow.  Have you ever heard of that?  No.  Exactly.  No.  You never banged a sink?  What's a sink?  A sink.  You mean like where you shave?  Yeah.  You put your hand on the edge of...  You know the long sinks in the hotel and the sink in the middle?  He's serious.  And you put your hand on the edge of the sink.  You kind of lie on top of it like this.  And you put your hand on the edge like that.  Hey, get that away from me. 
[01:56:30]  I really did look like I was just going to blow him.  You really did.  You were leaning over a little too much, man.  And he flinched, too.  It's a way of getting himself off with his hand.  Well, you know, looking at him, I understand.  Throw him on me now.  We've been having a nice conversation.  Any addictions?  It's time to beat up somebody else.  Any addictions you still have?  Coffee, cigarettes, anything?  Yeah, coffee and cigarettes.  Coffee and cigarettes.  Incessantly.  I should have quit cigarettes at the same time I quit booze.  Yeah.  I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes incessantly. 
[01:57:00]  You've got to have something, though.  You've got to have something, Harry.  Seems like you had a problem with being an addictive personality for years.  Well, you know what?  I've taken that compulsive, addictive behavior, because you can't change that.  And I've just channeled it into more constructive stuff.  You wake up at 3 in the morning, I've got to sell a house.  I've got to sell a house.  Shut up, bitch.  I have to sell.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Happily married.  Wow.  Look at that.  That was the character I was doing.  Look out the door.  Oh, there are some very attractive girls out there.  Oh, my goodness.  You want to meet the girls real fast?  They're here to hand out wow stickers. 
[01:57:30]  I don't want to meet any girl real fast.  I want it to last.  They're doing a little promotion for us.  As we get these girls in here, what do you think of the porn business today?  Do you pay attention to it at all?  Instead of being a million-dollar business, it's a billion-dollar business.  And the reason is hotels all around the nation buy these things and put them on the air for $12 a pop.  And that's what's turned it into a billion-dollar, more than a billion-dollar.  Never saw that coming in the porn industry years ago.  No, no, when I was doing it, there were no VCRs. 
[01:58:00]  There was no Betamax.  There was no nothing.  You had to go to the local...  You went to a seedy little theater.  Theater, yeah.  And you sat next to a stranger and got his raincoat wet.  Put your arm around him.  Hey, uh...  Oh, my goodness.  But what do you think of the porns getting freakier and freakier, though?  They're all...  I don't know.  I haven't seen them.  You haven't seen any?  I haven't seen a porn movie in 30 years.  There's a series out called Slap Happy.  And it's a lot of, actually, violence in it.  It's girls doing oral to the gentleman. 
[01:58:30]  But the guy is holding the camera as she's doing it.  And he's, like, smacked her.  The guy's holding the camera?  Yeah, he's the one doing the camera work.  And so you get that overhead shot.  And then he smacks her in the face and pulls it out and smacks her with it.  And it's a little too violent.  I don't like the violence thing.  I'll watch the sex.  Make him choke on it now.  Like a lot of this.  Make her gag.  You know.  Get that thing away.  And then they got the Baker's Dozen.  You know, it's Bukkake on the face. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know anything about that.  And my favorite porn I'm holding right now, Century Sex, sir.  Oh, have you seen this?  No, no.  Talking to porn legend Harry Reams, by the way.  Look at that woman.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What is Century Sex?  Looks like my mother.  Look at the cover.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Look at the cover there.  It could have been someone you did back in the day still doing porno.  Maybe.  You never know.  You know, my thoughts on what I did 40 years ago is I hope I had a good time.  I hate to feel that bad and not have had a good time.  If you're in the program, don't they tell you not to really hang out with people you used to know? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  You stay away from the people, the places, and the things.  They're going to get you in trouble.  Do you know or have you spoken with anyone from back in those days?  No.  Well, yeah.  There's one actor, Jamie Gillis.  He and I are friends.  Excuse me.  What about Ron Jeremy?  No.  Yeah, I know Ron, but I haven't talked to him in 30 years.  He's more a caricature of a porn star now.  But Jamie used to teach in the New York School District, and I worked for, I studied with Lee Strasberg.  So we were educated guys, and we had somebody to talk to. 
[02:00:00]  You studied with Lee Strasberg?  Yeah.  Get out of town.  Word of God.  Yeah.  He studied right across the street here.  He's a real actor.  No shit.  He's the real deal.  I used to be.  That's right.  Steve, you got a question for Harry Reams?  No, you almost covered it.  You mentioned, you asked him what he thought about the current stuff.  You know, guys like Brandon who are making the pseudo-Bukkake movies.  And they're making lots of money.  They are making a lot of money.  When I worked, it was a hundred bucks a day.  A hundred bucks a day.  Yeah.  Of course, after Deep Throat, it was thousands a day. 
[02:00:30]  Well, the performers really don't make that much money, comparatively.  I hear differently.  The women do.  Women make great money.  The guys make nothing.  The guys who are distributing it, like you said, in the hotels, those guys are making millions  upon millions of dollars.  Well, the owners in the film.  Yeah.  The guys that are actually just getting paid.  Chicks want to do DP.  You know, they're making some cake.  Yeah.  Guys don't make nothing.  I like the old.  I need a plot, man.  I like the old school.  I can't get into, the girl walks in, hey, how's it going?  You know, and just starts going at it.  They both have their place. 
[02:01:00]  Sometimes you like a nice, goofy plot.  Other times, you just want to turn it on and get the business done.  I love a plot.  I love a plot.  You do?  I do.  That's not entertainment.  Yeah, it is.  I need porno movies.  Because I need to go there.  Porno movies always were and will always be a sex aid.  Right.  It's titillation.  It's voyeurism.  Nobody cares about the storyline.  You're a mess.  It's not.  Listen to me.  I'm a bull guy.  I just told you I fucked a sink.  I am a mess.  I mean, we've established that. 
[02:01:30]  Harry dreams of calling you a mess.  This guy doesn't remember four years of his life and he's calling you a mess.  Three more years of sobriety than you, and I like to fucking sinks.  Yes, I'm a mess.  But I'm saying that you need that.  I need that story because I'm going to tell you, Harry.  He wants to care about the kids.  No, I don't want to care about these girls.  Because he needs to cry while he's whacking off.  I need midgets.  No, because I like the storyline because it's like almost watching a regular TV show, and 
[02:02:00]  then all of a sudden the chick's sucking his conch.  So, a film like Deep Throat you like because it had acting.  No, not acting.  You take the sex out of Deep Throat and you're left with 11 minutes of me.  Yeah, we got it.  Who the hell wants to see 11 minutes of me?  I like it, Harry.  We have some audio, I believe, of you from Deep Throat.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Let me hear a little of that.  Well, let's take a listen here.  Yeah, it's really quite common.  Perhaps you've had a traumatic... 
[02:02:30]  Is that you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you make a choice for the actor?  Anyhow, yeah.  I'm trying to figure out why she can't have an orgasm.  Right.  So, I'm looking all over and I look down her throat and I go, there you are, you little  bugger.  Can we reenact the scene right now?  I don't know.  Her clitoris is deep down in the bottom of her throat.  Yeah, her clit was in her throat.  And she starts crying.  She starts crying and says, well, suppose your balls were in your ears.  And I said, well, then I could hear myself coming.  We've got to listen to this.  It's audio from Deep Throat with Harry Reams. 
[02:03:00]  Well, it's really quite common.  Perhaps you've had a traumatic experience as a child.  No, I don't think so.  Nothing unpleasant that could have possibly turned you off to sex when you were younger?  You're getting me all wet.  Please stop it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Nurse!  Nurse, Miss Lovelace is done with her bubbles.  Ah, the music.  Nothing turned you off to sex.  Listen, doctor, please.  I'm not turned off to sex. 
[02:03:30]  I enjoy it.  In fact, I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.  Well, then what's the problem?  I don't know.  Something's missing.  Something's missing?  Yes.  Something's missing.  There should be more to it than a lot of little tingles.  Tingles?  I want to hear bells.  Bells?  Bombs.  Bombs?  And dams bursting.  Rockets red glare.  Bombs bursting in air.  Gave truth to the night that our flag was still there. 
[02:04:00]  Please be serious.  Nurse!  Nurse!  Take that away.  That's your problem.  You say that you want more out of sex than just a lot of little tingles.  Yes.  I want to hear bells.  Embodied.  Yes.  We just went through that, Miss Lovelace.  Let's not do that one again.  You know, I think your problem might be physical instead of psychological.  Have you ever had an internal examination?  No, I don't think so.  Step into my examination room. 
[02:04:30]  I want to take a look at you.  Please stop this.  Wow.  Harry Raves, everyone.  Oh, man.  Wow.  It's not the same without the picture.  It's not the same without the image.  You blew her away, her acting.  Oh, she really did.  Oh, she blew me away.  Oh, doctor.  You were putting on sort of an accent.  Oh, rather.  Watson?  Listen, I want people to go out and buy this DVD.  Inside Deep Throat.  Yeah.  It's getting great reviews.  It's getting great reviews.  It's been at every film festival since last February. 
[02:05:00]  Wonderful acclaim.  It's done by professionals.  And it's really not about Deep Throat.  Well, it is.  It tells the history of it, how the porno industry started and where it's at today.  But it really looks at America.  You know, it's the thread to tie together social change from the 60s to today.  And it's very fascinating.  It's very informative.  Well, I will definitely pick it up and check it out.  You want to meet the ladies really fast behind you?  I know you only have a couple of minutes left here.  What have we got here? 
[02:05:30]  These are the girls from GammaO.com.  GammaO.  I like it already.  Yeah.  What do they do?  That's the one you saw through the door of the blonde, I believe.  Huh?  Wait, that mic's not on.  It's not.  What do you got under there?  None of up.  You want to bring them over here?  What do you got under there?  They're not on.  The mic's not on.  Come on, let me see.  Come on.  I want to see you up here.  What do you want to see?  Here.  Here you go.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Somebody's from my heart. 
[02:06:00]  My heart.  Do you guys know who Harry Reams is?  I don't know.  No.  Legendary porn star.  Do you ever see Deep Throat?  No.  The movie Deep Throat?  He's in it.  You ever hear of it?  There's nobody here over 12 years old.  What are you talking about?  Huh?  Too busy at home trying it.  Yeah.  God bless her.  God bless her and her tulip.  If Harry stays to the rest of the show, we'll mess him all up.  Oh, yeah.  He'll be drinking.  Drinking and having sex on the console.  You'll be doing the scene.  You'll hear, oh, doctor.  He's doing great, but I can tell he's barely holding on. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  He's holding on by his fingernails.  By his fingernails.  I got to work off you guys.  Come on.  This ain't easy.  Harry, keep it together.  You got a four-bedroom that's going to sell on Tuesday.  Yeah.  Terrific.  That's right.  Terrific.  You'll be in one of them, won't you, Bob?  Yeah, I will if you get a couple of these girls.  I'll throw in a sink.  Ladies, any questions?  I'll throw in a sink for you by this house.  Ladies, any questions for Harry Reams, porn legend?  Yeah.  You must have a question about porn, maybe.  How big is your dick?  Oh.  Good question.  You mean then or now? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  He was packing pretty good in the day.  Was he packing?  In the day.  In the 70s, yeah.  In the day.  Huh?  Did it shrink?  Yeah.  Like everything else on the body.  I have no muscles anymore.  I have no thing.  I have nothing.  Oh, that's sad.  He's got a real estate business.  He's an old guy going brain dead.  You got a great hairline.  I'll give you that.  There you go.  Your hair is unbelievable.  Good for you.  What do you know?  If you were a woman, I'd marry you.  Well, what do you got to do?  You know, I live in Utah.  Polygamy.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, don't throw anything on him.  I'm sorry.  He's using the Lord's name.  Yeah, but he's talking about having sex with me, and I say Jesus Christ, and I'm the bad guy?  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  I'm sorry.  He's using the Lord's name in vain.  That's right.  I thought I was a guest.  Yes.  I feel like a prisoner.  How do I get out of this mess?  Any other questions for Harry Reams, porn legend?  How many chicks did you bang?  All right.  How many girls?  That was a good question.  I think I'm into four figures. 
[02:08:00]  One, two, three.  Wow, really?  Probably.  I had to figure that out.  And that was just 1974.  Yeah.  Wow.  No joke there?  I got nothing to say.  Over 1,000, you think?  I don't know.  Well, look at IMDb.  We're looking at 137 films on there.  Oh, for me?  Yeah, four, seven, three.  You know that's wrong.  And I'll tell you why.  A lot of clips.  Some of them say 1989, 1988.  I see that.  Why are you in Cumshot Review 5 in 89? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I know.  That's what I mean.  I stopped doing these things in 85.  They just changed the titles, put them in a new box with a new cover, and resell the same movie.  So you're saying you're not in oral majority, too?  No?  Not that I recall.  How about Backdoor Brides?  I don't think so.  No?  No.  If you took some Gamma, you could still make it some more movies.  Come on.  Come on.  Get off of this stuff.  All right.  Take a little Gamma.  You can make a couple more movies.  You're an old guy.  You guys are going to give me a stroke.  Well, they got this product, GammaO.com, and the girls are here today to hand out wow 
[02:09:00]  stickers all over Manhattan for us.  Ooh, did I get a wow sticker?  I showed you a wow.  Yeah, you sure did.  And it stuck.  That was pretty nice.  When was the last time, besides, you know, being married and stuff, when was the last  time you saw a strange girl's a strange push?  A while ago?  A long time.  A long time ago.  A long, long time.  That's pretty good.  I'm married over 16 years.  Wow.  I'm married over 15 years.  Any other ladies want to flash Harry your snatch?  You know, regardless of how beautiful they are and they all are, I still love my wife. 
[02:09:30]  Of course.  There's no interest here.  But it's always nice to see.  You love your wife.  God bless America.  Show me pussy.  She did that already.  Again?  Somebody else did.  What else she got?  Any, uh...  The way you did it was kind of like you were...  How about the top end for Harry?  So, what's go...  Here we go, Harry.  Here we go.  No, no, no, no.  The top...  I saw that.  The top... 
[02:10:00]  Oh, wow.  There we go.  Rock it.  Rock it.  Rock it.  Oh, we're working as a team now, Harry.  Come on.  The furrow star.  The hell with you, Bob.  We're really messing this guy up.  He's going to fall apart after...  Get Harry some Jägermeister.  I thought...  I'll tell you what's good in coffee.  Where's the Jägermeister machine?  A little Bailey's in the coffee is good.  And that's not even like drinking, Harry.  Of course not.  A little bit.  It's a coffee drink.  That doesn't count.  I got your back, Harry.  I won't let anything happen to you.  All right.  So, how much longer am I going to have to hold you guys up here?  All right.  No.  We're going to let you go. 
[02:10:30]  You're welcome.  Harry, thank you, man, for coming in.  You're a pleasure.  Enjoyed it.  Fantastic story.  Amazing.  Good luck.  Glad to see everything's working out for you.  Buy the DVD.  Pitch that.  Check out the DVD.  Inside Deep Throat.  Inside Deep Throat.  Yeah.  All right.  Harry Reams.  N.C. 17 and R.  I'll get the N.C. 17 one.  Comes out next Tuesday, the 20th.  Eepert and Roper, two thumbs up.  How about that?  So, it has to be good.  No.  Sure.  Very good.  And Entertainment Weekly, sensational.  It's going to be a hit.  Hot.  It's going to be a hit on DVD. 
[02:11:00]  It's Harry Reams.  Harry Reams, thank you, man.  You betcha.  Thank you, guys.  Now, get out.  See you.  Have fun.  All right.  Enjoy it very much.  You too, sir.  Take the headphones off.  Watch them headphones.  I thought I could take those home.  Take it easy, Eric.  See you, ladies.  He's dressed all nice.  Bye.  He's got a great head.  He had a great hair on his head.  He looks like he just won the Masters.  He does.  He looks like he just won the Masters.  Yeah.  He's one drink away from sounding like Tippy Tom.  So, as all people are saying, there's Tippy Tom in there. 
[02:11:30]  He sounds like a cleaned up Tippy Tom.  He said he also sounds like Chris Penn.  Oh, yeah.  That was Chris Penn action.  Sure.  Chris Penn in his voice.  Sure.  But, man, pulled himself together after a...  That's probably why he's still alive.  A lot of the porn guys from back then.  Gone.  Gone.  Ladies, any of you girls thinking of doing porn?  No.  Any porn on?  No.  Good.  Good for you girls.  Keep it together.  They're keeping it together.  It's the devil's lifestyle.  They're from Gamma O.  What are we doing today, guys?  We brought in some t-shirts that we were going to hand out as well as bumper stickers. 
[02:12:00]  T-shirts.  These ones didn't come out so great, but that's what we got.  That looks like something a kid would wear at the Special Olympics.  Hey, listen.  White t-shirt with the black, little black writing on it.  If you win.  I told you they didn't come out that great.  Did your 10-year-old daughter make that shirt?  We're handing them out.  Would you use a Sharpie?  And any shirt you have to stop and take more than five minutes to read.  We're handing these out to you guys.  What does that one say?  It says, I fuck me.  www.gamma-o.com, right? 
[02:12:30]  It's Gamma-O or just Gamma-O.  I always say slash.  It should be a dash.  It sure looks great on him because he's shredded.  Yeah.  They're all shredded.  Well, that's because of the Gamma-O.  Robert.  You know, people are going to walk by and just laugh at me.  Obviously, you don't know what the product's all about.  You know how many water pills they had to take to get those bodies?  How many water pills?  I didn't know water pills.  No.  Of course not.  I'm on.  Bob takes the water pills.  Let me see.  He's retaining water.  It looks like he's frustrating.  He's making fun of you. 
[02:13:00]  I know he is.  Kick his ass, Bob.  Kick his ass.  Bob, you going to take that?  No, I'm going to go out and beat the shit out of Hannah right now.  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to go beat the hell out of that old porn star.  You got to have a shot with him.  Every time you fuck with me, I'm kicking that guy's ass.  Is that what you want?  You know what sucks?  I didn't really hear what he said because he didn't have a wireless mic on him.  What did you say about Robert?  I said he's retaining so much water because he's menstruating.  No.  Those are fighting words, Robert.  What are you going to say?  If I keep abusing him, he'll really beat up the old guy?  Oh, stop it.  How are you going to turn him over and fuck him in the ass before he knew what was happening? 
[02:13:30]  And I'd thank him for it.  Listen, I like it.  It's the smallest big guy, too.  That's what annoys me.  I'm the squirrel of the group.  I am.  I'm the squirrel of the group.  He really does.  You guys do a lot of ass-kicking?  You kick some ass?  What do you mean you fight?  What do you mean you fight?  You pick fights with fat guys like me?  Mixed martial arts?  Yeah.  I'm so glad.  You know what?  I looked at him and I had a couple of zingers I was going to say to him and I went, you know  what?  Shut up.  You know what, Bob?  Just shut your face this time. 
[02:14:00]  Shut your mouth.  I'm glad I did.  Oh, it's the martial arts that's scary.  Take a look at what I'm wearing.  We're actually going to be wearing some of our gear and they're taking our stuff.  We're going to be on Pride.  Those guys are going to start wearing our stuff as well.  Those guys are familiar with KTFO.  They just purchased half of their company.  Wow.  KTFO Fight Gear has knocked the fuck out.  Right.  Hey, Master Poe.  Oh, I forgot.  You got Master Poe on my side.  Master Poe.  This guy was fucking with me, Master Poe.  The little guy with the baby chest.  The little guy was messing with you? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, the little guy.  What would you like me to do to him?  Nothing.  I'm just kidding, dude.  I'm kidding.  Relax.  Jesus.  Now, Poe.  Yes, sir?  Poe, you look at these guys.  They're big guys.  They're built.  You, on the other hand, you're more, what do they call it?  Natural.  Natural.  A little soft.  A little soft compared to these guys.  Not lanky.  These guys are ripped.  Well, this guy has probably double the width, size of the body.  But you, do you think you'd have a problem taking him out?  Well, he's talking about mixed martial arts.  That's a sport.  Yeah.  So, you have certain rules. 
[02:15:00]  There won't be any rules in the street.  No rules when it comes to Poe.  I'll stick my finger in his eye, and, you know, I'll pull out his teeth.  Yeah, who's talking tough now, huh, little man?  Huh?  You want to fuck with me, huh?  What were you saying about water, bitch?  Pogo's at you.  When Pogo's at you, it's like a piece of heavy machinery.  Well, you know what's funny is that these mixed martial artists, they're all skilled.  If you give them, if you take away those rules, then you're going to have death in the ring,  and you don't need that.  You need to have those rules.  I take that back, dude. 
[02:15:30]  No, I totally agree with that.  There's a lot of guys, when you're out in the street, and they have real good mixed martial  artists, and then they get punched in the face, and the whole world changes.  Really?  They're just not used to it.  The UFC guys, a little different.  They're used to getting punched in the face.  I watched that stuff on Spike and on Pay-Per-View.  Holy shit.  Who's the champ now?  That Chuck Lydell.  Chuck Lydell, yeah.  He's a fucking animal.  Animal.  The guy is an animal, and I can't get enough of it.  I watch it all the time.  Do you know Chuck Lydell?  Spectator Sport. 
[02:16:00]  I haven't met him.  I heard, actually, the last time he fought in Vegas, he knocked the guy out in like a  second, with a foot to the head.  A foot foot to the head.  With his foot thing.  Yeah.  But then he went to the strip club after.  I think Spearman Rano, and some guy walked.  He's not a big guy.  No, no.  Punched him in the chest.  He said something to him, and he just knocked him.  One punch, he knocked him the fuck out, right?  No, actually, the story that I got, and I don't know which is true, but the guy walked  up to Chuck Lydell and said, hey, how you doing? 
[02:16:30]  And punched him in the chest, and kind of ran away just to say, I got to punch in on Chuck  Lydell.  Holy shit.  I heard he knocked the guy out.  I heard the guy say, you don't look so tough, and he just knocked him the hell out.  My story's better, but thanks for fucking it out.  The guy walks up and just screams and takes off.  Mine would have been great.  It would have been rumors all over the internet.  Chuck Lydell knocked him out.  Yeah, you hear that chick with the frozen hot dog?  I got one, too.  Chuck Lydell knocked the guy out one punch.  We can come back and talk about martial arts all day long, but why don't we have the girls 
[02:17:00]  get naked while we're here?  Oh, well, somebody's right to the point.  Would they?  Well, I think I need my tank tops back.  Wow.  Start over there.  Start over there.  Come on, buddy.  Oh, these girls.  Wow, yes.  Hey, yeah.  Very nice.  The girls from very attractive girls.  Very attractive girls.  Are flashing us on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  This is our job.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Amazing.  And it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday and everything.  Fantastic. 
[02:17:30]  All the sizes and shapes.  Oh, my goodness.  Very, very nice.  That's what you call a cutie patootie.  Unbelievable.  Bravo.  Wow, ladies.  Oh, she's got the nipple piercing.  Yeah.  Nice.  And this one's ready.  Yeah, they're very nice.  They're both piercing.  Her skirt's ready to fall off.  Whoa.  Hey.  That's something you'll see every day.  What a trooper.  She's completely naked.  Good for you for doing that.  You love yourself, and I love you for it.  Very nice.  There's another one.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Good for you.  Wow. 
[02:18:00]  Good for you.  Wow.  I didn't think these girls were go-getters.  That is beautiful.  That is beautiful.  That is beautiful.  Whoa.  Yes.  And good for you, honey.  Wow.  Now they're all nice.  This is positive reinforcement.  Good for you, girl.  All right.  I guess we can plus comment.  I guess we should plug gamma-o.com.  God, I'm just such a creep right now.  Who the hell saw this coming?  This is great.  You guys are all gorgeous.  I thought it was, you know, girls that were just-  If you want to see it coming, take gamma-o.  Gamma-o.  Oh, there's a new slogan.  What happened?  Why wouldn't you girls do this for poor Harry Reams, who is now- 
[02:18:30]  Because he loves his wife.  Who now has to jack off to a quick pussy shot.  The one on the end there.  What's your name, sweetie?  Jessica.  Jessica.  What nationality are you?  A little everything.  A little Asian and Jewish.  A little Asian, right?  Now, how flexible are you?  I can put my feet behind my head.  Can you do that real quick?  I've never seen that done.  A chair?  You can do it right up here.  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  Yeah, right up on the-  No, no, no.  Over here, sweetie.  On the console.  Over here.  Do it over here so we can all see.  Right in front of Robert Kelly. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, it's a little more comfortable.  No, no, no.  Over here so you don't fuck up coffee and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Robert's worried about your safety, so you should do it right in front of his face.  There you go.  She could just about pleasure herself.  Can you show Opie the balloon out while you're in there?  Wow.  Gamma-O.com.  Did you hear the other girls?  That's amazing.  She's fantastic.  That is something.  I don't know what this Gamma-O does, but damn it.  Good for you.  Gamma-O is great.  Good for you.  Oh, my God.  What does Gamma-O do again? 
[02:19:30]  Gamma-O is an all-natural testosterone booster.  And obviously, you guys know you did a live read for us.  Yeah.  That airs.  And I've got to tell you, we have a big Opie and Anthony fan base that orders from us.  We have a lot of the truckers.  We got a lot of support from you guys.  I mean, it's an all-natural testosterone booster.  It's right currently, it runs at $99.97 a bottle.  It's a one-month supply.  We have almost everybody reorders it.  And today, for all the Opie and Anthony fans, we're going to take $15 off. 
[02:20:00]  There's a discount code.  They have to type in T-I-T-S.  T-I-T-S.  T-I-T-S.  Just for you guys.  Just for you guys.  Very easy to remember.  You just got to think of it a little bit before you figure out what it is.  It's usually, you know, radio or some kind of code word.  But T-I-T-S is all right.  It's T-I-T-S.  We should do that something they wouldn't forget.  Very good.  I'd love to actually get one of these girls to wear the robe we're going to auction off on eBay for the hurricane relief.  And what would that do?  Huh?  That would fucking look real sexy. 
[02:20:30]  They are completely naked.  I'm a Red Sox fan.  But there's no making and sexier.  That is one of my biggest fantasies.  Really?  With the robe and then they, you know, boom, and it kind of opens up a little bit.  And one, like...  They're naked.  Look at them.  Yeah, but you wear a little robe and have a titty hanging out.  He wants plots to his porno and he wants his naked girls clothed.  And he wants a faggot.  A robe.  And I want it open in the front.  And I want you to stare right at me.  He wants a wardrobe.  Sounds like he's trying to live out a fantasy, actually.  I think, is anybody up for the wiffle ball bat challenge? 
[02:21:00]  Wiffle ball bat challenge.  We'll give an extra hundred to whoever wants to do the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Wow.  Wow.  I'll let open in Anthony.  Wow.  An extra hundred.  Well, here's how it goes.  We haven't done this in a year, probably.  That bat is almost retired.  See the bat?  I was here the first time it happened.  That is a wiffle ball bat.  Yeah.  You see the markings on it?  With the corresponding names to the mark.  What is done is a condom is rolled onto the bat. 
[02:21:30]  A lot of lubrication is used.  And you could put it anywhere you want, as long as it's a hole in between the waist and kneecaps.  And then we see how far it can go.  We mark it, put the name, and whoever can get it the furthest wins.  You might ask what you win.  We've never given a prize to it.  But if anyone... 
[02:22:00]  A hundred to do it and two hundred to win.  Look, don't feel any pressure about having to beat the mark on there.  I'm a cock hog.  Just doing it.  You're a what?  I'm a cock hog.  Oh, you're a cock hog?  Do you see how fast...  A hundred to try it and two hundred to win.  And the thing, you know, jam mics in her face.  I'm a cock hog.  It's right in her face.  You'll get a hundred to do it and two hundred if you can beat the mark. 
[02:22:30]  No, there's no beating the mark.  I don't care how big of a cock hog you are.  Look at the name on the mark.  Bob Kelly.  Of course you're not beating that.  You're not beating that.  That is right.  I popped five people with some jammer up there.  They shout out like pomegranate seeds.  All right, they're studying the bat, Anthony, so...  Is it through wash?  Yeah, it's very clean.  A condom is used every time.  We use condoms.  So what do you say, girls?  You're like Asian businessmen right now.  They're like, I don't tell you.  Please break our dry spell for the whiffle ball bat challenge. 
[02:23:00]  And also, more importantly than breaking the dry spell, winning money or anything, is just  the fact that we're doing this when little fucking Jimmy isn't here and it will kill him.  He will hate the fact that after a year, we pull out the bat and he's not here to see it.  Good.  I have condoms also.  Hollywood-leaving bastard.  Well, I brought...  You brought condoms with you?  Yeah.  So you or the cock hog?  I can't make it to the mark.  I have a small pussy. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, cock hog, you want to try it?  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  All right.  I'll try it.  Yeah.  The bat is back.  If we could ask you to come up on the console over here.  Gamma-O.com.  Any position you want.  Now he's plugging away.  You need a non-flavored.  Now let me also...  Non-flavored condom.  That's a simple request.  No flavors.  Oh, we're here, here, ladies.  Now also, let me tell you, please, be careful with it. 
[02:24:00]  You will insert it at your own speed, your own depth, and the second you start feeling  uncomfortable, please stop.  We don't want you to hurt.  The second your tongue starts to come out of your mouth.  We used to push it in for the girls.  Oh, please.  Opie used to line up with his driver from golf and smack it in.  It was very, very painful for the girls.  Titanium one wood.  No, what's the other spore with the mallets?  Oh, croquet.  Croquet.  Yeah.  He put his foot on your pubic mound and smack it in to use a highlight. 
[02:24:30]  A highlight glove.  No, give me that.  Who saw this coming today, man?  God bless America.  That is back.  We saw it progress towards this.  I love it.  Jimmy has been holding us down.  Woo!  That's right.  Somehow, the girls see Jimmy and don't want to do shit.  Then you need a little sexy jawline.  I don't miss Jimmy anymore.  Is that what it is?  I don't miss him anymore.  I got the little goatee.  I'm all right.  Fuck Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  He's been blocking us now.  He's blocking the clock blocker.  What?  Opie, think about it. 
[02:25:00]  Think of all the shit that used to go on before Jimmy.  Right.  And then think of when Jimmy came aboard.  All that stopped.  The girls didn't want to take their clothes off.  What's this?  We couldn't get girls naked.  They were scared of him.  That's because they thought a little bald kid was in the studio.  We went from cock blocker to cock hog.  Right.  Now we got cock hog.  Cock hog.  Cock hog.  Oh, Miss Cock Hog, if you would please step up on the console.  Huh?  Cock hog.  We do lesbian shows together.  Oh, they do lesbian shows together.  Oh, great.  These are real.  You tell me. 
[02:25:30]  I can't.  That is fantastic.  Those are probably the most perfect.  Well, I had a reduction in a couple years.  Unbelievable.  You could pull the newspapers off of there because their ass will probably pick it up  with pictures like Silly Putty or something.  Oh, that could be funny, though.  Wouldn't that be funny?  I think she's got a picture of Dondi on her ass.  I want the headline, Katrina Killers, on her ass.  A picture of a dead Yorkie on her ass.  Whoa.  All right.  All right.  She is lubing up.  The condom is already rolled onto the back.  Yeah, you've got to get it all down the side, too, though. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, you want more?  Yeah, use a lot.  We like it juicy.  Where do the girls do the lesbian shows?  Where do you do the lesbian shows?  Wherever you want to show.  How are you doing?  Screw handing out wow stickers today.  That's why they came in.  She's my favorite, by the way.  It took Gamma O to bring back the wiffle ball bat out of retirement.  What's your name?  Mystic.  Mystic is sitting on Robert Kelly's lap.  He's sitting on pizza.  My name's pizza.  And you like her boobs, you said?  Yeah, well, yes.  Very lovely.  I do. 
[02:26:30]  36.  I need a tissue, too, by the way.  36 full D's, probably?  D's right here?  I'll tell you.  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  Let me guess, because I'm really good at it.  These are definitely a D.  And then I'll guess.  Oh, well.  I got a little mushroom cap right now.  Me and Harry.  A little Gamma O.  We'll fix you.  Is that what it does?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a testosterone booster.  So it makes your...  It's like...  You can't say hog booster or something?  We can say whatever you want.  Stop it wrong.  Because I thought...  It doesn't make it bigger, but it makes it harder. 
[02:27:00]  Keep it hard.  Oh, yeah.  So it's just an enhancer.  A sexual environment?  You know what?  The testosterone is like fuel for the man body.  Do you have one on you?  Yeah.  No, we'll send you one.  We keep sending stuff here.  It keeps coming back.  You just brought a bunch of girls in here, and you didn't bring one pill?  No, it's not a pill.  It's a liquid.  It's a liquid.  It's a liquid.  You drink it, yeah.  One ounce a day.  It works phenomenally well.  Do you realize if Harry was still here, he would have woken up in a jail in L.A. tomorrow  not knowing where he had been?  He'd be blowing me.  This would have put him over the time.  You know, God bless the guy, but you can see it in his eyes. 
[02:27:30]  He is hanging on by a thread.  I'm hanging on by a thread.  What about me?  Do we want to get this started with the back here?  Oh, of course we do.  We might have to do real radio.  See, you have a sweaty ass.  Yeah, you've got to back up a little.  This is fantastic.  Let her, uh, you want to put your feet up on a chair or something, like stirrups at  the old gyno's office?  Oh, my God.  Then put one on your shoulder.  You want a speculum?  Whatever that's called?  Speculum.  You want some salad prongs?  You want a spatula? 
[02:28:00]  Here we go.  Yes, we are ready.  Yeah, okay, get that out of there.  And I can't see what has to go there.  Opie, what do you need me to tell you?  But she said, what has to go?  Oh, she had to push the chair out of the way.  Oh, okay.  All right.  That's as far as I can go.  That's it?  That's come on.  All right, mark it.  Well, we can mark it.  Wow.  You went pretty good.  What?  Let me see.  You are like, she went, she went.  I swear, it's either she won or she's an eighth inch from cock cog. 
[02:28:30]  I got it.  You beat the mark.  Cock cog.  Cock cog.  Cock cog.  Good for cock cog.  Wow.  Good for CH.  That's good.  Wipe that piece of spleen off of the tip of that.  Wow.  Wait, Eric has something to say.  Her hair got longer.  She didn't make it.  There's a mark down here.  Oh.  What a buzzkiller.  Yeah, but that's my mark.  Wipe that off.  That don't count.  What a buzzkiller it is.  She didn't make it.  She didn't make it. 
[02:29:00]  There's another mark there.  What the fuck, dude?  You're not an Olympic judge.  Nothing?  Hey, are you shoving it up in any holes?  Exactly.  She's got a good point there.  Wow.  Cock cog.  Great job.  Good for you.  I'm a round of applause.  Good for you.  That's my cock cog.  Gamma O.  Gamma O.  Oh, by the way, that's how big my boyfriend's cock is from taking gamma O.  Is it really?  Yes.  Wow.  That big?  Almost the size of the bag.  Poor girl. 
[02:29:30]  You could play a game with his cock.  Always.  Yeah.  You could take it to the beach and have a nice wiffle ball game.  Throw a curve ball in.  I prefer the park.  Now, do you want to give this a whirl?  Me?  No.  I can't beat her.  Oh, you're talking about it.  You can't beat her.  Same deal.  All right.  Well.  Just to try it.  Just try it.  You can do it.  Put it in half of what she did if you want.  Just a little bit.  You know what?  She tried it all.  There you go.  Yeah.  I like your attitude.  I like the attitude.  This girl's a sweetheart.  Of course.  Just because the other one is.  We'll call you cock suckling. 
[02:30:00]  What's that?  Cock suckling?  Yeah.  Maybe someday she could grow into a cock cog.  She's got like a perfect ass.  Oh, partners.  Well, that works.  Yeah, they're lesbian partners, Anthony.  They do lesbian shows in their free time.  She's a cock cog.  The condom is rolled on.  She is lubing it up.  How do we get Jimmy Norton's first day away?  We have the bat used twice on two different girls in one day.  He is going to be livid.  I need foreplay.  Talk to me.  I need foreplay.  And you're going to bob? 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Well, cock cog is.  Wait a second.  I'm going to talk to you.  Hit her over the head with a hammer.  Focus in, baby.  Focus in, baby.  I've got to give her some foreplay.  That's focusing, baby.  You're in bat's arm.  Go ahead, Robert.  Help her out.  Kiss in, baby.  I just got K-Y in my head.  You know, they're really ruining a moment, don't you?  It's a work hazard.  Give her some talk.  Take your time, sweetie.  Take your time, baby.  Take your time.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Deep breath.  Kamo.  Kamo.  Yeah.  Put the bend. 
[02:31:00]  Put the bend.  Kamo.  Easy.  Oh, how are you doing?  Easy.  Breathe.  Feel like a...  No.  I won't go any further.  Yeah.  That's it?  That's it?  Let me see.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, not bad.  Not bad.  We could date.  That's good.  That's not bad.  I actually have a chance with this one.  Oh, gamma O.  That's good.  Do we have a moist towelette?  How about a Lysol towelette?  K-Y coming out of me.  What happened?  You bump into the cervix? 
[02:31:30]  I still got K-Y coming out of me.  Yeah, I chipped the tooth.  This is just not normal, man.  Oh, I love it.  Will you go for a hat trick?  Well, the girls are going to be walking around the area heading out wow stickers, I guess,  huh?  Any other ladies want to piss off Jim Norton by doing this?  Since we could say we had three girls try?  She says she'll give it a shot.  Yeah, give it a shot.  You don't have to win.  It's not about winning.  This is like the Special Olympics.  Everyone gets a prize. 
[02:32:00]  That's right.  Everyone gets a prize.  Who's Jimi Norton?  Jimi, uh, she's rolling the condom on.  I guess we're a lot of people asking how can we see pictures of these girls.  I guess we're going to throw some stuff up on opnancy.com.  Don't you worry about it, people.  Foundrymusic.com.  I need some gum.  What have we got going on?  If Steve gives us a link, we'll link to you guys so everybody can see it right from our site.  All right.  Very nice.  Very nice. 
[02:32:30]  Now we got the girl.  But I can do it with my legs behind my head.  Oh, there you go.  I'll let you put her legs behind her head.  She's a bit smaller.  We got cock hog, and now we got cock ouch.  Her legs are going behind her head.  Ladies and gentlemen.  No, she put a lubricated condom on.  No, you got to use more lube than that.  Yeah, more lube.  More lube.  Yeah, you got to put more lube on there.  Here, sweetie.  Let me open this for you.  It's not real. 
[02:33:00]  I don't need the tub.  There you go.  Ready?  Like she's going to get some go-go juice out of it.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  All right.  Ready?  Are you ready?  Yeah.  No, you need it.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Stay right there.  One of the T-shirts.  I'm messing all over.  I got QI.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  It's just in her eyes.  Swipe with a QI.  All right.  Now I have...  Eww, bleach.  Eww, bleach.  That's kind of nasty.  Wow.  Wow, this is wild.  Yes. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  Wow.  What do we got going on?  Nice, nice.  Go.  Doing pretty good.  Good for you.  That it?  Let's go.  Keep going.  You can do it.  Good for you.  Oh, she's pushing.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Don't hurt yourself.  Jesus.  Don't hurt yourself.  Wow.  Not bad.  Not bad.  All right.  Wow.  Well.  I could never be with any of these girls.  No.  I like small dicks, so.  Then I could be with her.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:34:00]  What did they...  Did somebody make this girl for me?  She's got a J-Lo ass, perfect real tits, nice pillow lips, and she likes small cocks.  What did I do right today?  You sat in that seat.  God bless this seat.  Give me who?  That's what you two are going to do a show.  I think we should be taken out with a little lesbian show.  A little example of the lesbian show you girls do.  You guys do a lesbian show?  Yeah, a little bit.  Really?  On the Liberator.  On the Liberator, perhaps?  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Well, we got the Liberator.  Let me clean up the spot for you guys.  From the fine people at the Liberator Company.  Thank you, Will.  We'll put it on eBay and auction this paper off.  I think we should auction off the original wiffle ball bat, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Good idea.  We'd get thousands of dollars for that.  That's a huge item.  I think you should engrave Gamma O right on the back.  Gamma-O.com.  Gamma O.  Poor little Jimmy Norton.  Who knew?  Who knew that the girls would come in and do this today? 
[02:35:00]  That's right.  We plan stuff out weeks in advance, and it never pans out.  Right.  The girls come in.  They're all, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  But you girls, we barely got notice you were coming in.  You're in.  And the best group of girls we've ever had.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Yesterday was good.  No complaining.  Nothing.  No complaining.  It was fun.  We're just here to promote Gamma O.  That's it.  Yes, you are.  That's it.  Where are you from, sweetie?  You from New York?  Yeah.  Queens.  Nice.  Queens. 
[02:35:30]  Queens.  I think Bob likes her.  What?  I think you like her.  What do you mean, like her?  I think you might ask her to go steady.  Is that what you just said?  Oh, Jesus.  I think Bob really likes this girl.  I still have KY coming out of my twat.  What did you say?  Remember the time we first met, honey?  How could I forget?  I had KY coming out of my twat for seven days.  All right, let me get rid of the gum. 
[02:36:00]  All right, the girls are getting on the Liberator.  Yeah, let's get rid of the gum.  The Liberator it's called, yes.  I saw that at Shopper Image.  Yeah.  It's great.  The leopard print's a little tacky, but it's comfortable.  It comes in all different types of coverings.  That's right.  You girls.  Can I at least kiss her first?  You girls do whatever you want.  Want to do a little scene?  Do a deep throat scene.  Pretend you're a doctor and she has something wrong.  Just let her go at it.  A gynecologist?  Put your legs in the stirrup, please. 
[02:36:30]  Harry Reams banging his perfect gray hair against the wall right now.  That he missed this.  That he missed this.  Watch me forward.  He's outside drinking.  Oh, he's doing shots.  Fuck my life.  Fuck the real estate business.  Fuck Jesus.  Back in porno.  Back in porno.  Back in porno.  The old creepy guy.  He's growing his mustache back.  As we speak, right?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You just noticed him yet? 
[02:37:00]  Well, we had to get the funny in.  He's busy.  Ladies, we had to get the funny in because there's some people out there that still want the funny.  Two girls very naked on the Liberator.  Thank you, Liberator.  Look at how their breasts are brushing each other.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Shut up.  This is fantastic.  Thank you, Gamma O.  Thank you, Gamma O.  Yes, Gamma O.  Thank you, Gamma O, for bringing wonderful girls in.  Oh, a little nipple play.  That's nice.  Yeah, I like that.  Just laying back on the Liberator.  I like the kissing, too.  That was nice.  It was kind of sexy.  Her titties licked by the other girls.  Wonderful.  Anthony? 
[02:37:30]  Shall we line up for this last shot?  I like the licking of the areola.  Yeah.  Last time they were together, she birdied this hole.  Do you guys want to get closer so you can see what we're actually doing?  I'll just hold.  You don't want us to get closer so you don't see what we're actually doing.  That's perfect.  That's great.  Robert's having a great appearance today.  Maybe if you could lift that right leg up a little bit. 
[02:38:00]  This one?  Can you just...  There you go.  Now I can see perfect...  Wow.  Wowee.  Look at the view.  That's a pretty...  Can you get that mic a little further out of my eye?  It's not a mic, honey.  There we go.  Wow.  That's a pretty vagina.  I was going to say stink wrinkle, but I didn't want to say that.  That'd be disrespectful.  Beef curtains.  Beef curtains. 
[02:38:30]  Who doesn't have beef curtains?  That's actually a packaged little pink pleasure happy lovelength.  I think that's what they call it in the business.  Yeah.  And she is working it.  She is.  And she has a nice cucka, too.  Look at that.  You're making her laugh.  She's laughing inside of her pussy.  What does that sound like?  That's it.  All right.  Let's hear it for the girls from Gamma-O.  Bravo.  Very nice. 
[02:39:00]  I am stunned we got this kind of accent back.  And go to gamma-o.com, right?  Wow.  Gamma-O.  These girls are going to be walking around the station handing out wow stickers for us.  All right.  That would be the best.  We've got to take a break.  We've been on the air for like an hour and a half straight.  So I have to go to the bathroom.  My water pills.  Water pills, you faggot.  You want to talk about your water pills now?  That's great.  Wow.  We found out Jimmy has been cock-locking us the whole time.  Little Jimmy Norton.  The girls look at him and run with their clothes on, wearing parkas. 
[02:39:30]  They run out of the studio.  Jimmy's not here.  Day one.  Two wiffle ball bats.  Lesbian girls all.  Three wiffle ball bats.  Three.  Three.  All girls completely naked.  Legs behind the head.  Porno star legend.  He ran away, though.  Cock-hawk, for God's sake.  Cock-hawk.  Cock-hawk.  Cock-hawk is a great name.  Cock-hawk is a brand new name on the message board.  I guarantee you that.  Hey, Cock-hawk.  How you doing?  Cock-hawk. 
[02:40:00]  When you were growing up, what did you want to be?  Cock-hawk.  Honestly, I still don't know.  Yeah?  When did you get your first cock?  When I was 17.  17?  Yeah.  And you couldn't get enough after that?  Absolutely.  Wow.  That's good for you.  Bravo.  All right.  And what do you do, sweetie?  I'm a stripper.  Really?  God bless you.  Over by the airport?  Private stuff.  Private stuff?  Yeah.  Bachelor parties, things like that?  Yeah, bachelor parties.  Really?  And then promotion for Gamma O. 
[02:40:30]  Good for you, sweetie.  Good for you and everything you do.  What about you?  What are you?  Same.  Same?  Stripper?  Same.  Stripper and promo model.  Really?  What about you, sweetie, in the back?  I promote for Gamma O.  It's a great product.  And I'm a cosmetologist.  You guys beat them up.  Yeah.  It works.  Every morning, my boyfriend wakes up with a big Woody, and I love it.  It's true.  Wow.  I've got to get some of this stuff.  How about that?  I've got to get some of this stuff. 
[02:41:00]  It's great stuff.  All right.  Keep sending you guys stuff.  With that, we're going to take a break.  All righty, let's take a break.  All righty, let's take a break.  In the studio.  Thank you.  Gamma O.com, everyone.  Gamma O.com.  God bless you guys.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Like sun is through the hourglass.  So is the O&A virus.  Most radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know, but I always thought it was such  a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll and all the other rock stations in your area, they're not the 
[02:41:30]  home of rock and roll.  No.  We're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot.  That fucking thing fell again right on my fucking foot.  I just want to kill you.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed, and it just fell  on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh. 
[02:42:00]  I'm sorry.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  He has a foot thing on his foot.  Why did that fall again?  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  Dude, I got a foot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis, and I have ligament  damage.  He's got an old man's foot.  And it's right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating. 
[02:42:30]  Anthony and Jimmy are very serious if he and Bob get on my foot.  It should not have fallen again.  Right on my foot.  Holy shit.  I saw his face.  He just turned that freaking whack.  Scared the shit out of everybody.  And then you look at him.  Did scare me, man.  Don't leave.  He looked like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut. 
[02:43:00]  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at his thing.  Look at his thing.  He has to wear.  Big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen? 
[02:43:30]  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZP for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit.  Is that irritating?  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of...  What is it?  It's solid.  It's bald.  It's probably eight inches off the ground.  Opie probably has a fishing string over there.  All right.  Right now again.  Quack.  My fucking foot.  I got a foot to my foot.  On my foot. 
[02:44:00]  Last ass fucking foot.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[02:44:30]  What a crazy, crazy show so far.  Yeah, man.  And it's only going to get better.  We got Otto and George in studio today.  Thank you.  I got to follow the wiffle ball bat and Harry Reams.  Great.  We got a little Katrina material here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like the Hurricane Katrina thing?  How do you follow a wiffle ball bat?  I know, Otto.  We shift the people in here a minute ago.  We always fuck Otto so bad.  He's got to follow the craziest shit.  And the Beatles next.  Yeah, it's the Beatles and the Otto and George.  Oh, I forgot to tell you. 
[02:45:00]  We're going to have to bump you because we got the Rolling Stones coming in for a quick interview.  Yeah, just a quick interview.  It's only a five minute interview.  I mean, Otto.  Mick's going to do the bat.  Well, we had girls with the wiffle ball bat and, yeah.  Harry Reams, legendary porn star.  Yeah, he was something, huh?  From Deep Throat fame.  He doesn't remember four years of his life, Otto.  Yeah, we were listening in the car.  Four years of his life, huh?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Did he make any money on that movie or?  Nah.  You know, we forgot to ask him that, but I don't think so. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, a couple of bucks, but those guys didn't make shit.  Yeah, a hundred bucks a day.  A hundred bucks and it's something like that.  The top grossing porn film of all time.  He's one of those guys hanging from a thread, though.  He's hanging from a thread.  And you can tell.  He's been hanging on for 16 years and he wants a drink.  He wants to fuck.  He wants to fuck.  Nothing.  You can see it in his eyes.  Yeah, because he's dressed in the part of a Christian, a real estate broker.  He was the one, by the way, that got that girl to flash her pussy.  We weren't even trying for that.  He went, hey, show me a little something.  The second the girls walked in, he was like, hey, show me a little something. 
[02:46:00]  Right, right.  Like the old Harry came out.  That's all it's going to take.  He didn't turn in like two seconds.  Two seconds.  Hey, settle down, Robert.  And show me your pussy.  Yeah.  See that snatch.  Hey, he started the whole thing.  And then, you know what it would take?  Nothing.  I wish we still had the Jaeger machine here.  I'd love to have gotten him drunk.  Anthony.  I would love him.  He's got 16 years of sobriety.  You want to throw him down the gutter?  We should have sent a camera to follow him after his appearance.  How do you think he's up at the scores right now? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, I guarantee we got him in a straight jacket right now going, Harry, Harry.  Harry, it's going to be okay.  You know it.  He scores.  Yeah, right.  That almost threw me off the wagon.  Oh.  Back shots.  Yeah, you like that, huh?  Oh, my God.  Well, Robert was saying some interesting stuff during the commercial.  You were ready to just dive in and say, screw everything, right?  Yeah, but I didn't.  Of course not.  I know you didn't.  Trust me.  I know.  But it's very interesting that that switch in your head was ready to just...  There's always a...  I'm telling you, man, with that...  I mean, that sex addiction, there's a switch. 
[02:47:00]  All she had to do is go, seriously, eat my pussy, fag.  And I would have.  And you'd have been right down there.  I would have.  Oh, you got it.  You got to prove you're not a fag.  Yeah, I'm not going to sit here with all these guys on Gamma O, and I'm not going to eat some pussy.  Honey, you have to understand.  A little KY in your mustache.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, I didn't.  It was that stuff like that.  I mean, you could see it in Harry, too.  You could see it.  Two seconds.  He was like, God and Christian and 16 years and Utah and then show me your pussy.  The second he looked at that snatch.  Turn around.  Second. 
[02:47:30]  Tick.  It's the perv switch.  Yeah.  He has it.  You got it, too?  The perv switch goes off in your head.  No, no.  I'm talking like anybody, even dentists, professional people.  It's when you're, you read about it all the time when these dentists feel up these chicks  when they're under anesthesia.  They don't leave that day thinking they're going to feel up a chick, but the switch goes  off.  And a hot chick sits down.  She's got a huge set of tits.  She sits in the chair.  She's snoring.  Okay, I'm going to put some nitrous here, and let me check this.  All right, the third bicuspid of, I need those tits!  They just, bam, and it happens that fast. 
[02:48:00]  You just turn.  And before you know it, she's coming to, her shirt is still open, and you're in jail.  Thank you, Albert DiSalvo.  It happens.  It happens.  Cops are at the side of a door writing a ticket.  All right, did you know how fast you were going?  You were speeding there.  Eat that box!  Boom!  It's like that.  All of a sudden, internal affairs, your career's over, you're done.  You ever get arrested?  Show me your ass.  Show me your ass.  Show me your ass.  How are you tonight?  The Kid Cat Club? 
[02:48:30]  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  He just was pulling them over for a ticket.  Yeah, see?  And then he snapped the switch.  Lost his mind.  Show me your cock.  A bush talking live on TV, hey?  Big shit.  He just snapped, too.  He's like, hey, Louisiana, show me your cock.  Show me your cock.  Well, what is the latest on Hurricane Karina?  Karina.  Did you hear this yet?  What? 
[02:49:00]  Hurricane Karina?  No.  What, a song?  No.  No, it's not even a song.  Yeah, who is this?  Listen to this voice.  Pronouncing the hurricane wrong.  Ah, it's only one of the biggest events that hit America in the last, I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't on the news enough.  Eh, maybe not.  Listen to this.  Because of Hurricane Karina, are starting to school this week.  And I also want to encourage anybody who is affected by Hurricane Karina to make sure  their children...  Now, who was that? 
[02:49:30]  Who do you think that was, Otto?  Dumb bitch, I guess.  Well, right.  The Game O Girls?  You really don't know who that was?  No.  Robert, do you know who that is?  All right, don't give it away.  Let's play it again.  Uh-huh.  Let me listen.  Listen again.  Very closely.  You should know this voice.  Because of Hurricane Karina, are starting to school this week.  And I also want to encourage anybody who is affected by Hurricane Karina...  Laura Bush?  ...to make sure their children... 
[02:50:00]  The President's wife.  Wow.  It's only the President's wife.  I got it, too.  I had that second one.  Karina.  Hurricane Karina.  Hurricane Karina.  Eh, it wasn't on the news that much.  Eh, only black people.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Hurricane Karina.  Wow.  Fats Domino's missing.  Who cares?  Fats Domino.  She got Katrina and colored mixed up.  They'd have sent out the National Guard if it was Axl Rose.  Meanwhile, they can't get Fats Domino. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, get Sean Penn in there.  Get those sea monkeys out of there.  Have some compassion.  Jesus.  Could you just say it is the puppet?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot I brought the puppet.  It's all good if it comes out of the puppet.  It's out of the puppet.  We're all in the clear.  That's how it works.  Really?  Come on.  Help us out a little bit.  Sea monkeys is funny, man.  I'm not racist, but that's a good one.  Wow. 
[02:51:00]  I love black people, but sea monkeys is funny.  All right.  We got something from Bush.  Listen to this.  Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government.  And to the extent that the federal government didn't fully do its job right, I take responsibility.  All right.  He takes responsibility.  All's good now.  I love that about politicians and people.  All you have to say is, I take responsibility, and it's okay now. 
[02:51:30]  Takes responsibility.  It's okay now.  And then goes forward and says how, I took responsibility, but we've got to move on now  and find out what went right and what went wrong.  That's the way to do it.  No more finger pointing.  I like how they just threw that FEMA guy under the bus.  That Brown.  Oh, my God.  First, they send him back up to D.C.  They put one of the National Guard guys or some Navy guy in charge down there.  And they send him back to D.C.  And the press asked, you know, what's the deal with Brown from FEMA? 
[02:52:00]  Why is he taken out of the site?  And they went, well, we've moved him back up to D.C.  so he can oversee the big picture.  So he can, you know, be up there and oversee the big picture.  He did a great job.  And then a couple of days later, his resignation is being tendered.  Bye-bye.  See you later.  And, like, people really resign.  Like anyone has resigned because they want to leave.  You're fired.  That's the way you get fired in Washington.  They give you a chance to slit your wrists in the bathtub with the wine and everything, 
[02:52:30]  and they'll take care of your family kind of thing.  A lot of jobs give you the chance to just resign, wink, wink.  Yeah, you have to resign.  If Eddie Murphy catches you on videotape lying, you have to resign.  Resign.  Yeah, always resign.  We never got a chance to resign, did we?  No.  We weren't really fired, though.  You guys were never fired.  You were still on the thing, right?  Oh, I didn't think of it that way.  Thank you.  We never really were fired.  We just had to sit.  Lucky us.  Sit and sit and sit. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, we got a Robert Kelly voiceover demo.  Oh, no.  Robert Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton today.  What's this, Robert?  Shit.  Shit.  That's...  I put it on my website because I thought it was funny, but I have a voiceover agent,  and I had...  You're trying to get voiceovers?  No, no, no.  This guy met me at...  Well, he actually was walking up to Keith Robinson at the cellar one night, giving him his card,  and I took it and threw it in the gutter, and I said, 
[02:53:30]  Do you really want that awful voice?  What are you selling?  Fried chicken?  God damn it.  Buy my chicken.  Wow.  God damn it.  You got to know how to get the chicken in there, huh?  I have five, fifteen special herbs and spices, and all of them fill it.  God damn it.  Now give it up for Jim Norton.  But, yeah, so I had to do a...  I had to actually pay for this myself, too.  Oh.  I had to go and do a voiceover. 
[02:54:00]  They just give you these things to read, these commercials.  You read them, and then they give you this tape, and he puts it on the website, and this  is what they use.  So you paid to have this.  It's like a resume, almost.  Yeah, it was like 80 bucks.  Yeah.  And you have it, and he puts it on his website, but I asked him for a copy of it so I could put  it on my website.  Yeah.  Just so people get it.  So potential clients will go to this website and pick out voices.  And say, he's the voice I want for my product.  Yeah, the only one I've ever booked from this is an angry baby.  I'm not even kidding.  What did they need an angry baby? 
[02:54:30]  I don't know.  How did that voice go?  Hey, you.  Over here.  Come here.  No.  Hey.  That's Joe Pesci.  Yeah, but it's an angry baby.  If they put a baby to it.  No, it's Joe Pesci.  A bad Joe Pesci.  Yeah, but if it was in North Carolina, they say this is an angry baby.  Does that sound like an angry baby?  Sounds like Norris doing the mini-wheat.  Exactly.  This is Joe Pesci.  Ready?  Yeah.  What the fuck kind of people are they, huh?  Come here.  Hey, Jesus.  Hey, hey, Henry.  Come here.  Now it turned into angry baby. 
[02:55:00]  No, this is angry baby.  This is angry baby.  All right, wait.  Let us...  All right, you do one.  This is angry baby for the abortion clinic.  Come on down.  We got a two for one.  What fucking product needed angry baby?  Yeah.  It was a health care thing.  Was it health care?  Yeah.  And what was wrong with the baby that he was angry?  I was mad.  I was mad because...  All right, hold on.  You do the voice and Aunt and I will guess Joe Pesci or angry baby.  Go ahead.  I'm even closing my eyes.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  There he is.  Hang on.  Listen. 
[02:55:30]  Let me tell you something here.  This health care plan stinks for me.  Um, I think it's a trick.  Joe Pesci.  Baby Pesci.  Baby Pesci.  That was the angry baby.  All right.  Now Joe Pesci.  All right.  Ready?  Spider.  Give me a fucking drink.  Jesus.  All right.  There's a slight difference.  As an actor, I made a choice.  Hold on.  We're going to do this.  Joe's not angry in that one.  Do the famous line from Goodfellas.  All right.  The Spidey and all that.  All right.  Spider.  Go ahead.  All right.  I'll do the...  From Pesci.  What kind of people are they? 
[02:56:00]  I'll do that one.  All right.  Okay.  That's Joe Pesci, right?  Yeah.  That's Joe Pesci.  All right.  Ready?  What the fuck kind of people are they?  Hey.  Henry.  Come here.  There you go.  I like that.  All right.  Okay.  Now do the exact same line as the angry baby.  All right.  Here we go.  Hang on.  I got to get into character?  Mm-hmm.  Hang on one second.  Here we go.  Because it's a little different.  Otto, close your eyes.  It's a little different.  It's just a slight...  I just got to get...  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[02:56:30]  What the hell kind of people are they?  Ken, give me...  You owe Joe Pesci some money.  Wow.  That is the same exact voice.  Slightly different.  It's slightly different.  Slightly different.  It is.  And the first one I said, hey, what kind of people are they?  The second one I said, what kind of people are they?  Right.  That's true.  The baby wouldn't know how to use hey.  You changed it up a little bit.  I changed it up a little bit.  What the fuck?  Ooh, this guy's a fucking moron. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  Well, Bob Kelly's voiceover demo.  Some samples.  Here we go.  Here's you talking about Gamefly.  We like the guys from Gamefly.  When's the last time the mail got you this excited?  Now, at Gamefly.com, you can rent every new release for PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube, and  it won't cost you anything.  We even pay the shipping.  Go to www.gamefly.com for your free trial.  That whole Boston thing, man.  Jesus Christ, does that come through? 
[02:57:30]  You know what?  It's your Xbox.  Xbox.  Gamefly.com.  Give me a joke.  There's 49 states going, I ain't buying this shit just because of his voice.  But did you hear that one point?  And it won't cost you a thing.  We at Xbox.  What, do you work there now?  You work over at Gamefly?  You're like the collective we.  No, they...  We can offer you...  But those aren't real.  We can offer you Zorks tickets, for God's sake, you motherfucker.  Hey.  Hey, Sally.  Come here for a second, you cock fuck. 
[02:58:00]  Sally, where's your PSP?  I got some good fucking games for this shit.  Oh, I'm gonna fucking kick it right in your neck with this fucking ninja game.  Look at this wicked cool fucking game.  Watch this.  I hit X, diamond, and a left one, you fuck face.  You're a fish-faced enemy of the people, you fucking weirdo.  We're...  We're...  We're...  We're...  It's great for a PSP or your Xbox. 
[02:58:30]  Even Nintendo 97.  All right, well.  You were just playing the regular guy there.  That was a regular guy.  That was a regular guy.  I'm expecting your voice to be a little different for the Wendy's read.  Is it?  Don't tell me it's the same fucking voice.  Well, the thing is...  And now he does baby bobbing.  This is...  This is...  You know when you do a demo, you gotta give him a few flavors here.  Mix it up a little.  Yeah.  Well, everyone is...  How about that Xbox?  Will?  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Yeah, see?  I like Wendy's burgers. 
[02:59:00]  They're swill.  All right, let's listen to the Wendy's read.  All right.  Who can enjoy a full moon on an empty stomach?  Now, no one has to.  Wendy's late night.  Classic single.  Classic double.  Classic triple.  Eat great.  Eat even late.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What is that one?  You're not Bruce Willis.  This is the weirdest thing, though, is the guy told me while I was doing this to...  I was actually jerking him off while I was doing it just to get into the mood.  Literally. 
[02:59:30]  You can tell by the...  Wendy's closing.  Wendy's closing.  You were using the movie guy voice.  In a small town.  That guy.  Was I?  Yeah.  It was definitely the drama was there.  Look, I met this guy in front of the cellar.  He said, do you do voiceovers?  I go, I never have.  He goes, would you like to try?  I go, yeah, whatever.  80 bucks.  But then I go to this place, and this guy literally comes in on his day off.  He does sound for a living, but he comes on his day off to do this horse shit for this guy.  So he's like, let's go.  Let's go.  I got to go.  How you doing?  Nice to be getting in the booth. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Just read this text.  Now, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm thinking something here.  I'm hearing the music.  I'm hearing the voice.  Now, the voice corresponds to the music.  Right.  Did you know what type of music they were going to play before you did the voice, or did  they use their knowledge and expertise to put the music?  Because that dramatic Wendy's music is behind your dramatic read voice.  It would be funny if there was like carnival music behind that.  Right.  This is the choice I made.  All right.  When I heard the music, I was actually, picture a night with, you can see the moon, but the 
[03:00:30]  clouds are going in front of it.  Uh-huh.  It's chilly.  So you knew the music was going to be great, but not too cold.  You knew it was going to be dramatic music.  And I was on top of a hill.  So you gave the dramatic read.  And I had three burgers.  Uh-huh.  One, a classic, a Wendy's classic single, a classic double, and a classic triple.  Yeah.  But you're not Clint Eastwood.  Eat my burgers, punk.  Right.  Well, it was a choice I made.  It was a little cold out.  The moon was out. 
[03:01:00]  You've got to ask yourself, is that a Wendy's classic or a Wendy's triple punk?  Fatso.  All right.  Hey, I really sounded like I was fucking the burgers.  All right, well, we're listening to the voiceover demo from Bob Kelly.  Oh, shit.  Starbucks.  Oh.  Was there a Starbucks?  All right.  What do you think?  Do you have a Starbucks voice?  Dramatic, fun, regular guy.  What type of voice did he use on this one?  I'm going to go with a little bit of a faggy delivery. 
[03:01:30]  Are you thinking like preppy?  Yeah.  Kind of regular guy, but a little more energetic and preppy-like?  Yeah.  It's got to be energy because it's coffee, for God's sake.  Yeah, he can't use this one.  No, no, no.  And Starbucks is very young and hip.  Right.  So he's got to do the young hip guy.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  A little older than the Gamefly voice.  What do you think, Otto?  The Clint Eastwood, which sounded good.  Yeah?  Do you like that one?  What do I know? 
[03:02:00]  Drink some Starbucks, you motherfucker.  All right.  Well, let's listen in and see how Bob Kelly does the Starbucks thing.  Nice Starbucks.  One moment for yourself.  Starbucks coffee.  Take a break this holiday.  Oh.  That was kind of a mix of them, too.  How could you go to sleep during a coffee commercial?  That was dull, Bob.  I'll tell you what I was thinking.  I liked your Gamefly so far.  Let me tell you my choice on that one.  Uh-huh.  Is that it was Christmas time. 
[03:02:30]  It was Christmas.  Okay.  And at Christmas time, you're not all crazy.  Right.  But you want coffee.  Yeah, but you want to...  You're taking stock of your life, your family.  But this is more like you're taking a cup of coffee to sit down and relax.  Take a sip.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And it's Christmas.  Relax.  Coffee to relax.  Relax.  Good idea.  Starbucks coffee to relax.  I've been drinking these espressos for hours now.  If I hadn't, I'd have been in a fucking coma.  Right.  Jeez.  I don't know.  I'm not digging that dramatically. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, we're not feeling the Starbucks.  So far, I'm all with you with the fucking Gamefly fucking Xbox spot.  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  I agree totally with you, kid.  Great.  All right.  He does an anti-drug commercial.  Anti-drug?  Yeah.  Let's hear what voice he picks for this one.  It's 3 p.m.  Do you know where your kids are?  Times have changed.  Keeping kids off drugs means knowing what they're up to, even after school. 
[03:03:30]  There are ways to do it.  Encourage them to stay active in the hours before you get home.  Kids involved in after-school activities are less likely to use drugs.  Call 1-800-788-2899.  Parents.  The anti-drug.  Call 1-800-FUCK-A-SYNC.  Do you know where your kids are?  In my trunk, whore.  Yeah, exactly.  Hearing you doing that is a little creepy.  Do you know where your kids are?  No.  I'll send a note.  You send the money.  And no Amber alert. 
[03:04:00]  No Amber.  There's no Amber alert.  You understand?  Amber.  If I see Amber on any fucking highway going up the Mass Pike, I'm stabbing her in the throat.  Do you know where your kids are?  No.  Where?  Where are they?  In my trunk.  Do you know where?  You're kidding.  Why?  They're in my trunk.  I was just talking to them.  Now they're in Bob Kelly's trunk.  Yeah, well, you're the anti-drug, whore. 
[03:04:30]  I'm anti-drug.  This is Uncle Alcoholic.  The anti-drug.  Oh, fuck.  I like it, though.  Very serious.  That's that no-joking-around-here voice.  Yeah, I got Harry Connick in the background.  Do-do-do-do.  That's a good one.  Why don't we try the clothing store one?  Oh, shit.  There's another one?  One more.  Here it is.  70% off regular prices on the world's finest clothing, shoes, and accessories for men and  women, tomorrow through Sunday. 
[03:05:00]  Ah, that's kind of you'll enjoy yourself here.  Yeah, that's like a sale-in Sunday type of read.  That's exactly what it was.  Yeah, that's all it is.  Wow, what are you doing here when you're probably so busy with offers?  With all your voice work.  I've only booked the angry baby.  And that wasn't on your audition?  On the real?  No, I didn't get that.  It wasn't a national thing.  It was just like a North Carolina health.  I didn't get it.  Oh, so you didn't get it through.  Oh, you didn't get it.  I didn't get the...  I got the gig.  You did.  I got it, but I didn't get a recording of it. 
[03:05:30]  Damn, how could you not bring that?  The angry baby?  I want to hear your angry baby spot.  I should see if...  Maybe my...  The health care?  Yeah, it's health care.  Hey, you.  Come here.  Yeah, you over there.  Come here.  Bring it.  I might get sick here.  You know, this milk might be wrong.  Your tip doesn't look too healthy.  And I might get sick and puke.  What happens then?  You got shitty health care, lady.  Oh, angry baby.  No, I thought you said angry baby's all right.  I thought you said angry baby's all right. 
[03:06:00]  You didn't need a drink.  No, I said fucking angry baby needs a drink.  All right, angry baby.  No, I thought you said spider angry baby's okay.  All right.  No, you fucking...  You fucking milk, yeah?  I said fucking I need a drink.  You get a drink for him?  You get a drink for him?  You get a drink for me?  You fucking drink for me, you fucking...  Give me a fucking drink.  You want a drink, angry baby?  Yeah, I want a fucking drink, you fucking cocksucker.  All right, all right, angry baby.  What is he fucking...  Who's fucking...  What the fuck?  I thought you said spider.  I'm okay, Angry Baby.  I'm okay.  You fucking dumb fucking...  I'm a fucking angry baby.  I need a drink every fucking hour. 
[03:06:30]  It needs to be warm.  Angry Baby, you're going to take the...  Oh, yeah?  What the heck?  Yeah, fucking...  You fucking cocksucker.  Now get the drink, you fucking cunt.  Warm milk in a glass.  Put a nipple on the end of it, fuckface.  Angry Baby.  I hate Angry Baby.  It's uncanny.  Really?  It's amazing.  It's a little different than Joe Pesci did.  Just a tad.  I'm picking up the subtle difference now.  Hey, we got someone else checking in today, Anthony.  Uh-huh. 
[03:07:00]  Arrestes.  Yo.  Hey, man.  Que...  Como esta usted?  Yo, mi ingles un poquito...  No good English.  Ah, que pasa?  Uno.  Bien, bien, bien.  How you guys doing?  Vamos.  Vamos.  Hablamos español.  Uh...  Como esta?  I think Angry Baby knows a little more Spanish than you do. 
[03:07:30]  Who the fuck are you?  Who the fuck are you, huh?  Maricón más brabicho, bandego gringo.  Ah, that's all I know.  Ah, that's all I know.  It's all good.  No estamos sortos, hijo.  Just picking dialogue from third-year Spanish out of my head.  What's up?  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  To arreglan mi cuatro.  Whenever you get a little stuck, just start, you know, reciting the menu from Taco Bell,  and you'll be doing pretty good. 
[03:08:00]  That's why I love Spanish, because you can just make it up.  Oh, really?  You want to lick my pastel alofus?  It just sounds like it works.  Add an O to everything, and you'll be all right.  Past pastel alofus.  Lick my pastel alofus.  That's a good bet.  I like that.  Now, you are working with XMMLB Español.  Yes, I am.  Ah, the Spanish language baseball channel.  I didn't even know we had one.  So they wanted you to call us to promote this fact. 
[03:08:30]  Well, you know what?  You guys are, you know, one of the hot tickets, so, you know, we figured your fan base is so  wide, and, you know, why not?  Let's put Solamente Palota, and we're on from 3 to 7, Monday to Wednesday.  Friday, so we have a good time over there.  Do you need to know Spanish to listen?  Not necessarily, man.  My show, guys, is quite bilingual.  I cross over a lot.  We have a lot of the regular American angle players that come on the show, you know, at 
[03:09:00]  times.  But for Donald, I'd say probably 75% is in Spanish.  So it's like a Spanglish kind of thing?  A little Spanglish.  That's a new trend going on right now.  You know the Mad Mexican?  Hey, the Mad Mexican's my boy, man.  Yeah.  He's my man.  In fact, he does my in and outs a lot of times, you know, promoting me.  So, yeah, he's on our team.  Yeah, we like that guy.  We just don't like his dog.  Chicago.  I haven't seen his dog, man.  Oh, it's always about Chicago, his dog.  Oh, all right.  Enough.  I'm going to throw it out a window of a high rise. 
[03:09:30]  You really don't like it.  He's going to pick it up and grab it and throw it in the garbage.  In the dumpster.  Yeah, fun story out of New York today.  Sorry.  Hey, who do you think is going to win the World Series this year?  Oh, good question.  Oh, that's...  Wow.  Look at it, man.  I'll tell you what.  You guys are just knowledgeable baseball aficionados.  Let me ask you this question before that.  Do you think the Yankees are going to even make the playoffs?  That is the big question, especially with a $200-plus million payroll.  If they don't make it, it'll be the biggest disappointment in Major League Baseball. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, don't forget Randy Johnson, both shortstops.  Say it again?  Don't forget Randy Johnson, both shortstops.  The best shortstops in the league.  One has to play third base.  No, I think, you know, the chances are real good for them to make it.  They just, they pounced on Tampa Bay last night.  They scored like 100 runs.  And so, you know, they seem to be back on track, but...  They scored 100 runs?  Yeah, I think it was 105 runs, something like that.  Wow, that's got to be like a record. 
[03:10:30]  In one game?  That's crazy.  Yeah, in one game they scored 105, 110 runs, something like that.  No, really they scored 17, but it seemed like 100.  Tampa Bay double race.  So what do you think about the Yankees-Red Sox playoffs?  Who's going to win?  I'll tell you, man, if they meet up again, it's going to be pandemonium,  especially, you know, the last couple of years they've been knocking horns  and playing seven-game series.  So if I had to choose a team that's a little bit, you know, better right now, 
[03:11:00]  I'd probably say the Red Sox, if they're pitching, is a little more solid.  All right, I can deal with you.  But, you know, hitting-wise, man, both of those, they just crush, man.  Good for you.  They're a good answer, and you're well-knowledgeable about sports.  You really know what you're doing.  Arrest this.  Yeah, buddy.  Barry Bonds.  Yeah.  Played with him.  You did?  Yes.  In my younger days, and his very younger days, he's younger than me.  He was a Pittsburgh Pirates, 1988, man.  He was my locker next door to me, brother.  He'd be and I go way back. 
[03:11:30]  And he's the greatest hitter of all time, period.  Arrest this.  Jason Giambi.  What do you want to know about Jason?  I don't really want to know anything.  Steroids.  Oh.  Yes.  You know, definitely.  You know, he definitely came out and said that.  There's a problem right now with steroid guys.  I mean, there's no doubt about it.  They've got to clean it up.  It hasn't been completely cleaned up. 
[03:12:00]  You know.  But baseball let it go and turned their back for a long time.  And all these home runs made baseball super popular again.  And now they've got to face the music.  What do you guys like?  You guys are in New York.  So, I mean, you guys got to have, you know,  you've got to be Mets fans or Yankee fans.  Arrest this.  The Mets.  The Mets?  Hmm.  Is that both of you guys?  Are you guys that are Mets fans? 
[03:12:30]  The rest is the Yankees.  Okay.  Well, I see.  I can see you're bipolar then.  But Arrest this.  I like the Red Sox.  You look at the standing and you like the team that's in first place pretty much.  Sorry.  Arrest this Mike Piazza.  Mike Piazza.  You know what?  He may be a Yankee next year.  He may just slide over from Queens to the Bronx.  That's the little inside rumor. 
[03:13:00]  Arrest this group.  The big unit.  The big unit?  Are you talking about the angry baby again?  Or are you just talking about Randy Johnson?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know the unit.  Arrest this Randy Johnson.  The big unit.  He's 6'10".  And, you know, if he's back on track, bro, watch out.  I'm sure neither of you two guys want to get up on the plate and face Randy Johnson.  I'll tell you that much.  You'd probably rather face King Wayfield throwing a knuckleball.  Arrest this Big Cock. 
[03:13:30]  Big Poppy?  Big Poppy.  Big Poppy's best nickname in the game right now.  Yeah.  You've got to love it.  And he's the Dominican Babe Ruth.  He's awesome.  Cock Hog.  Who?  Arrest this Cock Hog.  Cock Hog?  She's good with a bat.  I don't remember.  Very good with a bat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good with a bat.  Cock Hog.  Very good with a bat. 
[03:14:00]  Yep.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  That's what I'm saying.  All right there, Arrest this.  All right.  So, Arrest this.  It's Major League Baseball in Spanish for our Spanish-speaking friends, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it, man.  Major League Baseball in Spanish, 3 to 7, Monday through Friday on XM 190.  It's called.  Are you?  Are you at Shea Stadium?  Yeah.  Are you landing a plane right now?  Jesus.  Yeah, brother.  They don't pay you enough at XM? 
[03:14:30]  You've got to land planes before your show starts?  I'm multitasking right now, brother.  I'm talking to you guys from, you know, a cockpit and landing a plane.  Delta Airlines.  Oh.  Delta Airlines.  No, I'm not a big fan of Delta Airlines.  Arrest this.  No.  Boeing 767.  767.  I like the 777.  Oh, very good.  The Tokyo.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Arrest this.  Any Japanese, by any chance?  I also played in Japan many years, so you guys speak any Japanese?  Oh.  Arrest this. 
[03:15:00]  Godzilla.  Godzilla.  There you go.  That technically is Japanese, so very, very good.  Arrest this.  That would be Deki Matsui.  Very good.  Adios.  Okay.  Love you guys, man.  Take it easy, man.  You guys are tight.  All right, bro.  Later.  Be good.  I like Arrest this.  Arrest this.  Isn't that funny?  A Spanish guy named Arrest us. 
[03:15:30]  Adios.  So, we have Arrest us on the show to promote the Spanish language baseball channel.  We have a lot of Spanish language listeners.  On channel 190.  But if they're listening to our show, they could speak and understand English.  Right.  Why wouldn't they just go to the English?  Sometimes you want to get that Spanish feel to your call, maybe.  Maybe that's it.  You know. 
[03:16:00]  I guess.  Yeah.  We're still working out the bugs, I guess, of this whole thing.  I'm sure he's a very, very cool guy.  Arrest us.  Butt plug.  We were on to something, and then stupid Kelly had a highlight.  He goes, I like the Red Sox.  I want to ask you now.  What did you do wrong there?  We're going to, now, you're in training over here.  It just says, yeah, I know.  What did you do wrong?  Because you will be sitting in that seat from part of time.  You're going to be in that seat.  Now, when you see what we're doing, what should you have said?  Arrest us. 
[03:16:30]  The Red Sox.  Right.  There you go.  There it is.  Not, I like the Red Sox.  I like the Red Sox, you motherfucker.  In the baby voice, by the way.  It was Arrest us.  And then, like, a word, maybe two.  I really just wanted to be part of, guys.  It was a new bit we were trying, and you didn't help it.  I really, but I really did fuck it up.  The bit needs work, but you certainly didn't help.  You really didn't help.  You really picked it up at the end.  You had the set up, too.  You went, Arrest us.  I like the Red Sox. 
[03:17:00]  You were an ass.  I fucking sucked.  As soon as I said I liked it, I was like, what are you doing?  Otto and George in studio.  Board, Otto.  Oh, no, sorry.  All right.  I hit the ground running, and I never stop.  We're going to talk to Otto and George next.  Yes.  You got a gig you're promoting there, Otto?  Yeah, I got a few gigs coming.  I got a fucking CD coming out.  Ooh.  Working.  I watched your DVD. 
[03:17:30]  Hysterical.  Joe Conte's here.  He's dying to get to the mic.  I'm sitting there.  I don't say a fucking word.  Ah, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  I get the one at Joe.  Hey, Joe.  How are you?  The Jets looked awful, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry, dude.  And any recognition from the aristocrats there, Otto?  Yeah, people go see it.  I don't get paid.  No, I mean, are they recognizing you now?  It's a big movie.  It's a big movie out there.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm not recognized.  No, not at all.  Jesus.  You never get people come up to you and go, hey, Otto? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, the guy out there recognized you because I was holding a puppet.  Yeah, maybe you held the puppet the whole time.  Yeah.  But that would be a little odd.  You're onto something because when I'm with Anthony, I get recognized a hell of a lot more  than if I'm just by myself.  Especially when he has his hand up my back and I sit on his knee while we're eating.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue with Otto and George and other things.  Thanks.  We've got a real commercial from Toyota as we go to break.  Want me to do it?  Yeah, Toyota's a fucking great car. 
[03:18:30]  Four-door.  We hate the angry baby.  Do it as Pesci.  Toyota's a fucking great car.  It's a four-door.  What kind of car is it?  I like Pesci so much better.  Fucking car.  Yeah, Honda.  Fucking Honda.  Christ.  A Toyota is where you are, Henry.  No, that was the baby.  That was the angry baby.  See, now I can tell.  You're right.  It's a little different.  Restless, I like angry baby.  This weekend, for the first time in Toyota history, an unprecedented sale will change everything. 
[03:19:00]  What if we told you to get any new car, truck, or SUV?  All you needed was $99 down and $99 a month.  I'd say you were full of shit.  Well, we're not.  Get ready for the no shit sale from Toyota.  No shit.  No shit.  No shit.  Toby Hines, fearless leader in Gulf States, Toyota has gone completely apeshit.  An authorized...  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:19:30]  ...just to sell you...  Wow, this is kind of awkward.  ...any car, truck, or SUV for a ridiculously low...  ...99 down and $99 a month.  No shit.  No shit?  You gotta be shitting me.  Nope, this shit is for real.  It's the no shit sale from Toyota.  $99 down, $99 a month.  But you better hurry because this shit won't be around forever.  In other words, shit or get off the pot?  Exactly.  It's the no shit sale.  Well, $99 down and $99 a month gets you any car, truck, or SUV you want. 
[03:20:00]  Holy f***ing shit.  You said it.  See your Toyota dealer now.  Get the feeling.  Toyota.  $99 down payment, $99 monthly payment, not through Gulf States Toyota.  No shit sale does not apply to any existing Toyota car, truck, or SUV anywhere, anyhow, anytime.  Not a limited time offer.  Don't see dealer for details.  In other words, we're full of shit.  Well, no shit.  I love showing my boots to introverted fat guys.  We whip them out Wednesday.  We whip them out Wednesday.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[03:20:30]  I'm not as bad as people would think.  I will say that women who have hooked up with me at times, even just regular dates, are always surprised.  I'm not completely the creep they expect me to be.  Really?  Yes.  The ones that live through it.  Very gentlemanly?  Yes.  Very gentlemanly?  Yeah, I'm not.  I'm a nice fella.  So you get to know them a little.  Yeah.  And you start to sing.  Ooh, that sounds good.  And you start telling them what it would be like if they had to sit and watch you and  her father.  Oh, yeah, that was a good one. 
[03:21:00]  Snuggling and you jacking the father.  Yeah.  And just, and just, he lets it go in my hand.  He puts his face in my neck and goes, and he just groans in my neck as it bubbles over  on my hand.  And he paints these pictures for these girls.  Oh, is that horrific.  I used to love that one and telling her how I was going to hug her grandmother, but then  just grab her grandmother's ass and press my heart on into it against the kitchen counter,  like into her crotch.  Like, that's what she said, too. 
[03:21:30]  She said the worst part of the whole, like she'd come down the steps.  And the way I would describe it is that me and her dad would have our pants pulled down  just to mid-thigh.  Like, we wouldn't be naked.  And she said the worst part was the pants not being all the way off and the face in the  neck.  She said that was the worst part.  Oh, the father, you feel his little razor stubble on your neck.  Like, he can't look at me, but it just feels too good to make me stop.  And they'd have to walk around with this image in their head. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  That is hysterical.  You're an awful human.  Too good.  Would she laugh at that?  No.  Maybe she's like, ugh.  Yeah.  It would just gross her out.  Why?  As soon as I found that out, I couldn't stop.  Every time we saw a family member, I'd think of a new way I could sexually accost them.  No Opie and no Jimmy. 
[03:22:30]  It's just the Anthony show with my special friend, Robert Kelly, in the studio.  Oh, fuck.  What the fuck, you fucking fuck, yeah.  What's up, man? 
[03:23:00]  It's just us.  You're just us now.  What happens with these long breaks, Opie goes and takes a walk sometimes, and we get  left.  And then me and Jimmy chat.  How you doing?  Now you've got to sit in there and chat.  Chat with me.  Chat with you.  Oh, he's back.  Here he comes.  There he is.  Hi, Opie.  It's so awkward when the show restarts and you're not sitting there.  I get scared.  We're having a really fun show today.  I'm having a blast, actually.  Anthony, you were explaining this.  I really don't know this story. 
[03:23:30]  The Houston mother fight?  Two mothers fighting in Houston?  Yeah.  What, the mothers are from Louisiana?  See, no, I guess one's from Louisiana and the other one is from the Houston area because  there was a fight in a school.  Remember when all the refugees from the hurricane went over there to Houston and the mayor and  the governor of Texas and everybody said, all your children will be sent to school.  Don't worry.  We'll take care of their schooling.  Well, they put them in the schools and apparently now they're fighting. 
[03:24:00]  They're just fighting.  These schools have to be, whew, that's got to be a fun place to be.  I'm just looking at the video from it and it looks like very inner city school.  But why are they fighting?  Because, Opie, because.  Pause.  That's the reason given?  If you put, you see, you can't put the tiger in the lion cage.  Well, they'll fight with each other.  It's just kind of a territorial thing.  Really, the tiger in the lion cage? 
[03:24:30]  All right, look, I'm trying to make an analogy and keep my fucking job.  All right.  So that's what I'll say.  But it is.  I may have used a different analogy last night in my home in the privacy of my own house.  Like silverback gorilla?  Was that one of the animals?  Oh, stop.  No, it wasn't one.  I don't know.  A horrible man.  All right.  But they're fighting.  And then when the police got there and the press arrived, how did the press get there so quickly?  I don't know.  Maybe that's someone else's camera. 
[03:25:00]  And the parents arrived.  So now these women, who look exactly like the same women we saw coptered out of New Orleans.  And for some reason they look the same in Houston, too, the mothers.  Big, fat asses in wife-beater t-shirts.  It's like a uniform.  And they started going after each other, the parents of the kids.  Well, the video's up on opiananthony.com.  Foundry, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  I don't know how much you can make of the audio, but it's just pandemonium. 
[03:25:30]  And, again, the cops have to deal with this.  I don't understand why they're fighting.  They're fighting.  One kid jumped another, and then the mother showed up, and then they're fighting.  And it just seems to be this underlying violence thing going on between the two cities.  I guess the kids that went to school there aren't happy to be helping the kids that are coming in.  There were times growing up that my mom was upset, but she never showed up at the school and fought another mother. 
[03:26:00]  Thank God.  How embarrassing would that be?  Right.  When your mom shows up at school, it just means embarrassment.  It just means you can't take care of things.  Oh, they grab you by the hand.  What did you do to my boy?  Oh, you're the faggot.  You're the faggot now until 12th grade.  Mom, go home.  Please.  Mom, leave.  I'm fine.  Here's the audio.  Go on for some basketball.  I'm going to say basketball.  Oh, no.  I know you didn't.  I didn't say you.  I know you didn't. 
[03:26:30]  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I know you didn't.  All right.  Let's play.  I heard something about a basketball.  I heard basketball.  But that could mean anything.  Really?  All right.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to start over.  Like hearing the in a sentence.  When you hear a word that makes sense, please shout it out, okay?  So we can maybe figure out what this fight's about, because that's all.  I don't give a fuck.  I just want to know why they're fighting.  That's all.  Why the fighting?  Here we go again.  Go on for what you're going to say.  I'm playing basketball. 
[03:27:00]  Basketball.  I know.  I know.  He didn't.  He didn't.  I didn't say you.  I didn't say you.  I know you don't.  I know you don't.  I know you don't.  You don't know myself.  I know you don't.  I know you don't.  I know you don't.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  You don't know my name.  I heard that.  I heard that, no.  Speak, Taylor, speak. 
[03:27:30]  Look at them, look how they act.  I swear to God, I heard that in the background.  You'll find your destiny.  Oh, oh, I got benefits.  It is your baby.  Murray Dunn told me so.  Uh-oh. 
[03:28:00]  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.  I heard it now.  Did you see a sign that said Dead Digger Storage?  Not about my coffee jewels.  He'd go like this, I heard.  I heard he'd go like this.  He'd go like this. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  All right, well, that solved everything.  Sure did.  Now I understand.  The whole thing is summed up.  Oh, Jesus.  What a mess.  Well, thank you for that non-story.  These are people that just can't get along.  Why?  They're refugees.  They've been brought to a certain place for help.  And there's fighting going on.  It's hot.  It's real hot.  Maybe it's the heat.  It's the heat.  It's the heat, Anthony, down there in Houston. 
[03:29:00]  It's the dry heat.  It's the heat.  The sun hits your skin.  Someone wants to know if...  Yeah, well, let's go to the phones.  John?  Hello?  Go ahead, John.  Yeah, I think one of them said, Boo got shot.  Yeah, where's Boo got shot?  Boo got shot.  You ever hear Boo got shot?  No, man.  You got to hear Boo got shot.  While we're looking for Boo got shot, I'll play this one.  Yeah, this is one of my favorites.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[03:29:30]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  UPS.  Oh, that's fucking awesome.  Yeah.  UPS.  Cigars and Scotch is going to help us with the translation.  Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I hear one woman repeatedly screaming, spinning causes gravity.  Spinning causes gravity.  Very good.  All right.  Here we go.  Didn't one say the foot thing on my foot?  I heard her.  I have a foot thing on my foot.  Way in the background. 
[03:30:00]  I have a foot thing on my foot.  Has that name been taken on Wack Bag?  Foot thing?  A foot thing.  Foot thing.  It should be, and it will be.  All right, here we go.  Boo got shot for Robert Kelly.  Uh-huh.  She was taking real bad news.  Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody.  Oh, Pam.  She called my cousin, Punkin, that sailed up.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chee-Chee, she had left out, and she went down her car, she bailed out. 
[03:30:30]  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot,  and I seen some boy had runnin' the building over it that way.  He ran that building.  I seen that car that flew off, and then I seen a long gun.  Of course.  We don't runnin' the car.  All right.  I'll give you $1,000 if you know what she's talking about.  Dude, I love the way she said, building.  Building.  Building.  My cousin, Punkin.  And then my cousin, Punkin.  Pauline. 
[03:31:00]  Pauline.  Pauline.  She never said Pauline.  She said Pauline.  This is a good one, too.  This is a woman that was trampled over when they were giving away free computers, or $50 computers, at a huge arena.  No, that's not it.  It's Bank 6.  Here you go.  Look at my name.  I'm an earthen.  It's a grand old time, and I just started kicking the people in the balls and everything.  It's like, you know, I never stressed, so I couldn't breathe.  Sounds like Rich Voss. 
[03:31:30]  Now, this was right off the news.  Me and Bonnie, we're going to get married.  I was on stage.  All of a sudden, they trampled the stage.  Gotta go to Canada.  This woman was trampled there, and the news is interviewing her, and they can't understand what she's saying,  because they never would have allowed her to say, she goes, I kicked him in the balls.  No.  Yeah, that's what she's saying.  Why didn't she say that?  Listen closely.  I'm going to kick him in the balls.  Look at my name.  I'm an earthen.  It's a grand old time, and I just started kicking the people in the balls.  And the news person's like, yes, yes. 
[03:32:00]  They had no idea.  She just said, they're kicking people in the balls.  Look at my knee.  Look at my knee.  Anthony, I want to play along.  I got one, too.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, listen to this one.  For many days, I didn't bring him here, because I suffer when he bites me.  He bites me in my vagina.  When I'm walking, and he sees all the dogs, right away, he jumps on my vagina, because he 
[03:32:30]  gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything.  And he bites the labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to bite my labrador and his penis.  My labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  I got another clip from that lady.  And my vagina, two times, he bites me.  But his teeth are very small, and they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  What the hell is that from? 
[03:33:00]  What is that?  Is that real?  Yeah.  Is it a real lady?  It's a real news thing.  Oh, I want to meet that lady.  All right, getting back to Boo Got Shot.  We actually have the translation.  Boo Got Shot.  Do you do?  Yeah, someone took the time to listen to the audio and translate it.  Listen to this.  Uh-huh, she was shaking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness.  Peaches, they got shot, they got shot.  Someone has been wounded.  The whole hope.  I inquired as to who the victim was.  Boo, she said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot wound.  Boo got shot. 
[03:33:30]  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh my God, oh my God.  Oh me, oh my.  We just saw it.  My sister had called somebody or a pen.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin Pumpkin to sell dust.  In fact, it was my cousin Pumpkin who lives in this very same community.  She called her, and Pumpkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Pumpkin was already on the phone with the local authorities.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car, she bailed out. 
[03:34:00]  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out, piercing the cold night air.  And when I heard the gunshot, and I seen somebody had run in the building over that way.  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building.  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there.  And I seen that car, that thing flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber. 
[03:34:30]  A big old gun in it.  I mean substantial.  The boy was in the backseat, he had a big old long gun.  In fact, it was the gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel.  There you have it.  The translation of, ooh, God, shot.  My cousin pulling.  I love how she says he left.  He left out, left out, left out.  You left out your mother.  Is that the angry baby? 
[03:35:00]  No, that was Pesci.  Oh, right.  Everyone knows that was Pesci.  Stop.  What's wrong with you?  Did he laugh out?  All right.  We're trying to move on to, yeah, the Opie and Anthony auction is going quite nicely.  Go to opiananthony.com for all the items that are up.  Can I tell you about this robe thing here?  From the Yankee robe there you're putting up on the auction?  Yankee cranky robe? 
[03:35:30]  Yankee cranky?  No, it's a Yankee robe.  It's got pinstripes on it.  It's got pinstripes.  It's official.  These are the actual robes that all the Yankees players are wearing in the clubhouse.  They just got them Friday.  They're all wearing them.  Jeter and A-Rod wear these?  Yeah, you can get them all in the clubhouse shops in Manhattan.  Yankee's clubhouse shops in Manhattan's.  They all have them now in Manhattan.  You're doing a commercial.  Well, for the guy who gave it to you.  I would do a more dramatic read.  Yeah, why don't you?  All right, how about this?  Do I have any music?  Do you have any music?  We need some dramatic music. 
[03:36:00]  Do you need some dramatic music?  Do you want the Wendy's read?  I want the Wendy's read.  Yeah.  Real dramatic voice.  Derek's working on music.  We could do a little of that movie with Jack.  Oh, The Shining?  The Shining there.  Shining music?  Yeah.  That might work.  Unless you have something else that you're going to.  I'll be ominous enough.  What?  Oh, that's good, too.  That's for Matt.  The hurricane was a tragic, tragic thing. 
[03:36:30]  But I hope you and Anthony have put things on eBay to raise money for the hurricane relief.  And one of those things is a sports robe.  The Yankee...  Ease...  Idiot.  Idiot.  Just got them in their locker rooms this past Friday.  Idiot.  They just came out in stores and are sold exclusively at Yankee Clubhouse shops in Manhattan.  Mama. 
[03:37:00]  For more store locations, go to...  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  www.sportsrobe.com.  Again, that's www.sportrobe.com.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Thank you.  And God bless.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  Let's see what Ron and Fez are going to be doing on their program today. 
[03:37:30]  Hey, um...  We should get them.  We're trying to get through the rest of the audio here.  NBC News story on 11.  Caged kids in Ohio.  What was this about?  They found, like, 11 kids, was it?  Caged up in someone's house in Ohio.  So, it's about all I know about the story.  Haven't heard any clips.  All right, let's listen in.  Authorities in Ohio are investigating how 11 disabled children were kept in cages by their foster...  Ah, they're disabled kids.  Who cares?  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:38:00]  That was a real story.  Oh!  Wow!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Jesus!  Jesus Christ, though.  Don't waste my time.  We're sports.  Ah, there they are.  Ron and Fez.  Hey, Ron and Fez.  Oh, hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, bodies.  Bodies.  Ron and Fez.  How goes the battle, buddy?  Their show will start in minutes.  Yes.  And then, because a lot of people are very confused, we've got to start telling people what's going on here.  Ron and Fez are on the East Coast from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Then we go back to, like, a worst of hour of Opie and Anthony from 2 to 3. 
[03:38:30]  And then today's program will re-air at 3 p.m. Eastern.  Right.  There you go.  It is confusing.  It's a mess, but we'll figure it all out as we move on, okay?  Yeah.  Including getting more exposure for the guys, more replays.  Don't you worry.  Yeah, stop your bitching.  Stop your bitching.  Five seconds.  There is so much bitching going on.  Yeah.  On both message boards.  Let them get comfortable.  I see it on your guys' message boards, our message boards.  There's all kinds of heat. 
[03:39:00]  And don't act like we've never done this before.  We're just settling in.  This happens every time.  No, it doesn't.  This is the first time it's ever happened.  Today's a big show, though.  We're talking about Bob Kelly's brand new website.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Hey, we got a good one.  Oh, we got talking icons.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Listen to this.  That's a good one.  Listen to this.  What is this?  This is some of the audio that you get from Robert Kelly. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, when you roll your cursor over the links on his webpage, unlike just a regular webpage  where it gets highlighted a little bit, you'll get annoying audio coming off of his website.  There you go.  My face.  What the fuck?  What the?  What the hell's wrong?  Ready?  My face.  My face.  Wow.  What do you find at MySpace?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Yeah, it's a, I always thought of MySpace, friends, there's faggy, faggy thing. 
[03:40:00]  That's why I was kind of joking about the My face because it's a fact.  Oh.  But let me tell you something.  There are so many, there's a million people on that.  Yeah.  And there's, dude, MySpace is something that has nothing to do with your site.  That's what made Dane Cook famous.  What, MySpace?  Yes.  Yeah, you're probably right.  It really helped out Dane Cook because I was reading some things about Dane Cook and he  mentioned MySpace.com.  It's unbelievable.  Or whatever it's called, MySpace.  Unbelievable.  Oh, look at that.  And who did the animations on your site?  That was my Asian web guy. 
[03:40:30]  Actually, Norton makes a cameo in the air as a little worm that I pull out of my ass.  And he goes, I'm all about the poop.  And then jumps off the bar of soap.  Let's be honest.  After today, Norton who?  I mean, come on.  Who?  Right.  Exactly.  I mean, the foot guy.  The guy with the foot thing on his foot.  We had so much action in here today.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  Now, another one of the interns, we get to meet the weird interns that you guys gave us. 
[03:41:00]  Uh-huh.  The one who is focused on Anthony, weird enough.  The other one is totally focused on Norton.  And I didn't even know his whole weird backstory, but he's a Norton wannabe.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And it's just frightening.  Yeah.  You've given us the...  And all the scary interns we've ever had, these have got to be the two scariest.  Only the best for you, Ronnie.  Yeah.  I don't want to be alone with my own interns.  This one's trying to emulate all of Norton's habits.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, that's a healthy thing to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that'll make for good radio.  For a while.  Till we're dead.  It's me, me.  What the fuck is that?  What link is that?  It's a links page.  You can't even hear it.  You can't even hear it.  Me, me.  He's going to play the bad one in a second.  Dear Robert, you are funniest.  Thank you.  I can't understand it. 
[03:42:00]  That's the naked kid page?  It's a little kid saying what?  Dear Robert, you are the funniest I've ever seen.  Pete Townsend got busted for this kind of stuff.  Yeah.  You've got to be careful.  Kids on the websites.  That's my schedule button.  New clip of the year.  We love that clip.  Oh, look at the time.  What a bummer.  All right.  Well, tomorrow on the program, very, very excited, extremely excited, Bill Burr sitting 
[03:42:30]  in for Jim Norton.  What?  Not that you didn't do the job.  This is one day?  Yeah.  He gets one day.  He's just settling in.  He's just settling in.  Look at me.  Look at Billy.  He's a little redhead.  The white race.  Billy fits in with Opie a lot better.  No, actually, you know.  We should just have you and Billy do a show.  All kidding aside, Robert Kelly did a great job today.  Absolutely.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Thank you for having me again.  I've been reading instant feedback and a lot of comments coming in saying one of your 
[03:43:00]  best appearances ever.  I have a blast every time.  Thank you very much, folks.  And thank you for the wiffle ball back.  All right.  We might have a minute or two here.  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned two out of four ain't bad.  Three out of four ain't bad.  Okay.  I got you at the last second there.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, what's up?  Mike in Jersey.  I learned today that the HIV virus can be killed if you drink enough and you won't get AIDS.  There you go.  AIDS killed by booze.  We learned that today. 
[03:43:30]  Prozac from Whack Bag.  I learned the show went from cock blockers to cock hog.  And I learned Bob has the line of the day.  You love your wife?  God bless America.  Now show him your pussy.  That was a good line.  Let's say hi to Calvin in West Virginia.  Calvin?  Yeah, I learned today that Boo got injured by the perpetrator.  Oh, yeah.  We did learn that finally.  Very good.  Yes, we did.  Very good.  Also want to thank Harry Reams for stopping on by.  He was losing it.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  20 years of, no, 16 years of sobriety and you could see it in his eyes.  He was ready to go on the edge.  He was ready to go, man.  Dialing Sid on the other line.  Hey, buddy.  After 16 years, we just about had him over the edge.  Yeah.  A girl flashed and you could just see the switch going off in his eyes.  He was ready.  He had new strange snatch in his face for the first time in years.  You never really quit the mafia, do you?  It's always right there.  There you go.  Running Fez next.  That's it.  I'm out of here. 
[03:44:30]  Thank you. </pre>
