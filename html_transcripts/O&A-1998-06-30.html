<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a self-deprecating opening, noting their initially meager listener count (six, climbing to eleven). Anthony then regaled listeners with a humorous account of his recent move, highlighting his minimalist furniture situation (cable spool coffee table, milk crates for storage) juxtaposed with his immediate acquisition of cable television.  The hosts transitioned into discussing a large-scale construction worker protest in New York City, comparing the scene to a chaotic moment from *Blazing Saddles* and imagining the reactions of nearby office workers.  They then commented on a striking anti-smoking commercial featuring a woman with a throat hole who continued to smoke, a discussion that prompted some reflection on their own smoking habits, including Anthony's recent cessation.

A caller criticized their discussion of the anti-smoking commercial, accusing them of mockery, a charge they denied.  The hosts then unveiled a new website feature designed for instant listener feedback.  They proceeded to read and comment on letters from the "Voice of the People" section of the Daily News, focusing on critical remarks about Mayor Giuliani and opinions about Vanna White's role on *Wheel of Fortune*.

The show's final segment centered on an upcoming Star Trek marathon on Channel 11.  This prompted a playful exchange filled with impressions and opinions about William Shatner's acting and favorite Star Trek episodes, along with discussion of specific episodes and characters.  They also briefly touched on their future plans for online content before closing with more listener feedback – both positive and negative – and a final, slightly improved, tally of their listener appreciation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  WNEW, where rock lives, Billy Joel, of course.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Saying hi to the six people that like us so far.  Yeah, we're up to six, we like that.  We gained three listeners yesterday, actually.  And today we're going for four more, so we have a total of ten people out in the New York area that actually like us.  The pressure's on.  The pressure is on.  Oh, we do have to say hi to all the people from Long Island that do remember us from our radio days on the island.  We're getting lots of email. 
[00:00:30]  From those folks, and we notice.  Thank you very much.  Right?  Back in the ancient days.  Yeah, that goes back four or five years ago now?  Was that 1948?  49, I remember, post-war.  So, Anthony?  Yeah, yeah.  You moved into your apartment, congratulations.  Don't, don't.  You finally settled in the New York area?  That's great.  What?  As the prom date said, that's a little premature.  What happened?  Uh, I, I, I have an apartment. 
[00:01:00]  Uh-huh.  And no furniture.  Where's your furniture?  I don't know.  I haven't a clue.  Right.  The moving company took my furniture.  I do believe I saw some of my stuff for sale in the park.  On a blanket.  Really?  I'm not sure, but I recognize some knick-knacks.  Uh-huh.  That might have been mine.  So, yeah.  It's, it's at the point now where we have, uh, an apartment and, uh, a portable TV.  Right.  And cable.  You got cable around?  Oh, yeah.  You don't have furniture, but you got cable.  Now, it looks like a dorm room. 
[00:01:30]  You got cinder blocks.  Yeah.  Uh, the big spool.  Oh, the big spool is your, like, uh, living room table?  Yeah, the cable spool.  Right.  You know, that says Lilco on the side.  Right.  And, uh, yeah, various milk crates that are, of course, are a crime to possess.  Right.  We have them.  Well, just drive around the neighborhood and you can get a couch, I'm sure.  They're all out on the side of the road, so.  I'm just, uh.  I got an old.  Up in the air.  I got an old yield sign if you, if you need some decorations for your living room.  Groovy.  And I think I got a, uh, a Budweiser, uh, like, you know, bar lamp. 
[00:02:00]  A light.  Something that went over a pool table.  Yeah.  That's what I need over the dining room table.  I got some stuff.  And I got my old orange, uh, shag rug from the college days if you want to borrow that  until your stuff comes.  A few, uh, two-by-sixes and, uh, bricks for shelves.  Right.  And I'm set.  Yeah, because you don't have your stereo yet.  No.  You know, I knew you were in trouble.  Me and Anthony had to go to LaGuardia Airport last night.  What a nightmare.  Four-hour delays.  We had to dodge all the lightning bolts that were coming down in Queens last night.  That was amazing. 
[00:02:30]  Wow.  Amazing.  Absolutely.  Absolutely amazing, the stuff that was flying through the air last night.  But, uh, you know, there was delay, so Anthony decides to call his old apartment to make  sure the movers got everything, and he got his answering machine.  I got my answering machine, which means they didn't take my phone.  An answering machine.  Right.  And this was at nine o'clock.  And they were supposed to be out of there by then, right?  Oh, yeah.  With all this stuff, so.  Long gone.  Oh, so you're going to be in a great mood today.  I'm in a fine mood.  I don't care.  All right.  I'm one of those people, I don't care. 
[00:03:00]  Cool.  Well, the phones are ringing off the hook.  More hate calls.  Cool.  We'll get to that next.  If you want to send a fax, 212-957-WNEW.  And we're coming back with Third Eye Blind.  Stay there.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Pearl Jam from the Yield CD and Wishlist.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony on your radio for day what?  What are we up to?  Four days?  Five days?  Yeah, something like that.  Five days, I think, we've made it so far.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  And what's going on in the city today?  Are the cabbies striking now today? 
[00:03:30]  Well, yeah, it looks like the city's in big trouble again.  After yesterday?  I don't think anyone's going to top that demonstration yesterday.  Yesterday, we had 40,000 protesting construction workers on Madison Avenue clashing with the police.  Yeah.  Made all the big news stories.  Today, cabbies numbering in the tens.  In the tens?  All right.  In front of City Hall.  They're in front of City Hall right now, and there's 10 guys?  There's not as many, let's say, as 40,000 construction workers.  I think they had to dispatch a couple of security guards to get the raucous cabbies under control. 
[00:04:00]  So they're not organized, I guess.  No.  For some reason, I just think it comes down to money.  I think a cabbie would rather be in his cab making money than protesting.  I think it's a language problem.  They all speak different languages that they can't really get together and figure out where they're supposed to be for the demonstration.  That's a pretty good concept.  I didn't even think of that.  You know, there probably is this language barrier that keeps them from uniting.  Yes.  I think that's what it's all about, actually. 
[00:04:30]  Although there was a language barrier last night.  I was watching on the news between some of these construction workers.  I think it was drunk and sober.  Did you read the Daily News about the riot yesterday that even a horse got punched?  Yeah.  That's a nasty demonstration when horses start getting punched.  It's like the scene from Blazing Saddles.  Yeah, exactly.  The bungalow punches the horse.  Right.  I noticed one thing.  I think to be one of these construction workers, I think I got the pose.  What you got to do is put both hands up in the air, clench your fists, and go, 
[00:05:00]  And just yell.  Because every picture of them, look at this.  Yeah, I see it all.  It's got their mouths open.  Right.  And both arms up.  Yeah.  Sometimes both arms, fists, and one finger is up.  My favorite was the guy with the Jets jersey on, ripping down the American flag.  Mm-hmm.  I think he was like the hero yesterday.  But, you know, something we should touch on today.  That riot was going on. 
[00:05:30]  40,000 construction workers.  Did you hear what the women were doing during this riot yesterday in Midtown?  I was reading about this.  Yeah.  The women in all the office buildings around the riot site, they were well protected.  They're like 10, 12 stories up.  They were all just gazing at the construction workers and falling in love.  Yeah.  Look at the abs on him.  It's like that old, what was it?  The Pepsi commercial?  The Diet Pepsi, yeah.  The Diet Pepsi commercial where, you know, the girls are checking out the construction workers.  Yeah.  They were doing it for sure yesterday in Midtown.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Matter of fact, if you were one of those ladies checking out the scene yesterday, we would love to talk to you today. 
[00:06:00]  I want to see how much work you actually got done, right?  Yeah.  All right.  You can give us a call.  On the way, we got some great rock and roll, of course.  Want to do some Everclear next?  Yeah.  Let's do that, huh?  I've got to interrupt the program for one second here.  Anthony, I know we have a lot of people listening.  Yeah.  But how many people actually like our show so far?  All right.  Total right now is up to six. 
[00:06:30]  We have six people that like us out in the New York area?  Total of six.  I think we might have two more.  Let's go to the phones.  Hi, N.E.W.  You can add the total to six, make it eight.  1027-W-NEW, The Rock of New York.  You two from Achtung, baby.  Also in their Marcy Playground, Sex and Candy.  And we started the hour off with Better Than Ezra.  And good.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I hope you're enjoying the program today.  Yes.  We're psyched to be here.  And Mayor Giuliani, what is he on today? 
[00:07:00]  It seems today...  Every day he's got a new cause in this city.  He does.  He's a busy mayor.  He's a very busy mayor.  He's jumping all over the place.  Our old mayor wasn't a busy mayor.  He spent most of his time just trying to kick me and you out of the fine city of Boston.  At least this mayor in this city works.  He's doing something.  Right.  He's always out and about.  I'm looking at page 18 of the New York Daily News.  And there's a picture of Mayor Giuliani.  And he's got his big beluga whale forehead picture in the paper. 
[00:07:30]  You look at his forehead.  It looks like one of those, like a honeydew melon with a little tarantula on it.  That's how I'd describe him.  It's pretty accurate, actually.  He wants stiffer penalties for people caught selling cigarettes to minors.  Yeah.  I guess the Daily News did an expose.  And because of that, Mayor Giuliani is going to make it tougher on the people that sell to minors.  Are we ever going to get rid of underage smoking, though, in this country?  Seriously.  Isn't it kind of like a rite of passage? 
[00:08:00]  It is.  You have to go through it, I think.  Didn't we all at least try some cigarettes when we were younger and most of us grew out of it?  Yeah.  You've got to realize it's pretty bad for you and then just stop.  And I think nowadays it's really hard to continue your cigarette habit unless you enjoy going out in the cold with your buddies and it's 10 degrees out.  Exiled.  It's not bad in the summer months.  But in the winter when you're walking into the building and you just see the huddled mass of smokers.  Outside the building, freezing as they take care of their habits. 
[00:08:30]  It's like, hey, I think your cigarette's been out for about 10 minutes now.  Yeah.  It's just the steam coming out.  Yeah.  So anyways, he's getting on that campaign.  And in the paper, like Anthony was getting to here, they had a bunch of kids in the New York area rate the cigarette, the anti-cigarette commercials that are on TV.  And most of these commercials are pretty lame.  I wouldn't stop smoking if I saw these commercials.  No.  Except for number one.  Whoa.  And it's the lady with the hole in her neck in the voice box. 
[00:09:00]  Debbie.  Debbie, yes.  Her name is Debbie.  What you see, the commercial opens with a close-up of Debbie, a woman with a hole in her throat who says she had her first cigarette at 13.  When I was 13 years old, I started smoking.  She tried to quit but couldn't.  It's because nicotine isn't addictive.  That's what she said?  Or thought when she was 13?  That's right.  She says that she takes a long drag on a cigarette that she places up to the hole in her throat. 
[00:09:30]  How can they say nicotine isn't addictive?  Uh.  Uh.  I'm going to be a bag of cigarettes, kid.  Yeah.  When I see somebody, you know, using a voice box, that scares me to stop smoking.  Without a doubt.  That's enough to make you just stop.  Yeah.  We had a relative when I was growing up.  I think he was related to the family.  I'm not really sure because no one would talk to the guy.  We were all scared S-less.  The guy would come over for Christmas when we got all the relatives together.  Yeah.  And he had the voice box. 
[00:10:00]  He had the hole in the neck.  And he continued smoking the cigarettes through the hole in his neck.  Oh.  And he was exiled to another room because he would scare the kids.  Come here.  Give Uncle Mike a kiss.  No.  Come here and give Uncle Mike a kiss.  Well.  Yeah.  What hole do you want me to kiss?  Ah.  You know?  And then, you know, we would sit around and start singing Christmas carols and stuff.  And the guy would join in with his voice box because he was just trying to fit in with  what was going on.  That's horrible. 
[00:10:30]  It is horrible.  That should make you stop right there.  I think so.  But, I don't know.  I wish the mayor luck on this campaign.  Kids have to smoke because they think it looks cool.  That's the bottom line.  But when you get older, you've got to realize it's bad for you and put the things down.  Yeah.  I used to smoke.  Anthony used to smoke, what, two, three packs a day, right?  Well, not that much.  You smoked a lot.  It was about two packs a day. 
[00:11:00]  Two packs a day.  All right.  And you know what happened?  I woke up one morning and said, you know something?  This is pretty bad for you.  Yeah.  I said, I have a career that my voice is pretty important.  Right.  And I should pretty much give up smoking.  So, you know what I did?  I threw the cigarettes away and didn't smoke anymore.  You have to say to yourself, I'm not going to pick up a cigarette.  You consciously pick up a cigarette, put it in your mouth, and light it.  Don't you?  You do that.  You have to.  You know you're doing it.  It's not like you all of a sudden go, oh, I'm half done with a cigarette.  Wow, how did that get in my mouth and lit and puffed halfway down? 
[00:11:30]  So, if you just don't put it in your mouth and don't light it, you won't be smoking.  Don't give me any addiction stuff.  Put a needle in your arm.  Put some heroin in you for a week.  That's an addiction.  I don't know.  Then you'll start, like, when you're physically on the floor in the fetal position,  then you might understand addiction.  But cigarettes, come on.  Don't pick them up and you won't be smoking.  It was that easy to quit, Anthony.  That's it?  Man.  You've got to have a little willpower.  You're lucky, though. 
[00:12:00]  And how long haven't you smoked for now?  Over here?  I think five hours.  No.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives with Joe Walsh.  Just a reminder, don't forget, beginning tomorrow and all weekend long, we've got your tickets  for the Brian Setzer Orchestra at the Hammerstein Ballroom on July 16th, plus a copy of his latest 
[00:12:30]  CD, The Dirty Boogie, all this weekend where I can swing with 1027 WNEW.  Sophie and Anthony, we've got a bunch of people on hold complaining about you and your voice  of a box, Anthony.  I don't understand it.  We're just talking about a story in the paper today.  Rudy Giuliani.  Right.  Trying to crack down on people selling tobacco products to kids around the city.  And a couple of little stories about commercials that are very effective at keeping kids from  smoking. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  One of them is Debbie, commercial featuring Debbie, who had her voice box taken out, now  has a hole in her throat, and still smokes through the hole in her throat.  Yes.  And she's talking to the kids like,  I get to take cigarettes for an addictive, now I know better.  That's sick.  And the kids have decided that's the most effective anti-smoking commercial that's on TV right 
[00:13:30]  now.  Because it's frightening.  It's frightening, and it's scaring the kids from, you know, keeping them from smoking.  Exactly.  Keep me from smoking.  Well, this guy has a problem with you.  Hi, NEW.  I've been listening to the station for a number of years, hearing what you guys have just done  in regards to the laryngectomies that I think you guys made a total mockery out of them.  A mockery?  Don't you understand that we were just conveying how awful it is to smoke and have to go through  something like that?  Yeah, I agree with that.  And we said if the kids see those commercials where, yeah, someone's using a voice box and 
[00:14:00]  has a hole in their neck, that will make me stop smoking.  Hearing the way how you guys were playing around with the idea of the voice box.  Well, you want to sugarcoat it?  It's an awful thing.  It's horrible.  I know exactly what it is.  I've seen people with that.  I've worked with people with that.  So have I, and it's horrendous.  It is.  I don't question that at all.  But the way how it was coming off on this end, and the couple of people that are sitting  here listening to this, we basically feel that it's being used as a mockery more than 
[00:14:30]  anything else.  Why would you say that?  Come on.  You had to do that, huh?  That was not a mockery.  Well, the guy wasn't going to agree with us anyway, right?  I don't think so.  Hey, we got new technology for our show, by the way.  I don't know if we should tell the people about this now, because we're going to get  flooded with hate responses.  But that's okay.  If you go to the WNEW website, and you click on our section, which is our baby pictures, 
[00:15:00]  because we're too scared to show anyone what we really look like, I guess there's a section  where you could click on it, and you could pop a message right into the studio, and we  could read it instantly, right?  Instant feedback.  Instant feedback.  Bam.  Right there.  Instant feedback, which is scary, but we'll deal with it.  And it's only going to happen between the hours of 3 of 7 during our show, right?  Technology.  Science.  And then they shut it down at 7 until the next day.  But if you want to get an instant message to us.  1027 WNEW, where Rock lives, Black Crows, and hard to handle from Shake Your Money Maker. 
[00:15:30]  I do believe we're going to get the Black Crows in here eventually.  That'd be cool.  Maybe if we can talk them into it, they'll play live for us, too.  Hmm.  That'd be fun.  We got plenty of room.  Just like Grant Lee Buffalo did on Mr. Herman's show last week.  That was really, really cool, actually.  It's Opie and Anthony.  One of my favorite sections in the New York Papers is the Voice of the People section in the Daily News.  Sometimes it gets you, though. 
[00:16:00]  And you read a letter from somebody, and you're just like, oh, shut up.  Well, it is America, though.  It's so off base.  Well, this one's pretty good.  Carolyn from Brooklyn writes about the mayor.  Hmm.  And the title is Godfather.  Godfather.  Godfather.  Like a mobster wannabe, Mayor Giuliani has a vendetta against anyone who crosses him or whom he just doesn't want around.  Like street vendors, taxi drivers, pedestrians, Cooney students, sidewalk artists, subway riders who take up the two seats or hold the doors, tenants in rent-stabilized apartments, anyone who dances at a bar, and the Grammys. 
[00:16:30]  Here are a few suggestions for Rudy to further improve the quality of life in our fine city.  How about running those Mr. Softy trucks out of town?  That repetitive nursery rhyme must be breaking some noise codes.  Those Salvation Army Santas, aren't they just panhandlers in red suits?  And can he force parents to ship off to camp all those kids running around making noise and having fun all summer long?  Carolyn.  Wow. 
[00:17:00]  Giving them a fuck there.  Yes.  And also in the Voice of the People.  Now, that one was at least about something that people care about, the mayor.  Yeah.  A lot of people hate the mayor.  A lot of people like him.  And there's no real middle ground here in the city.  George from Oakdale, Long Island.  What does he want?  This is in the same Voices of the People section.  Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune should be more considerate of Vanna White.  Very important subject here, yeah.  When they first walk out on stage, he dismisses her like she's extra baggage. 
[00:17:30]  And he's anxious to get in the spotlight.  Pat, try this.  Ladies and gentlemen, my co-host, Vanna White.  And then let her go to the board to the sound of applause.  Ah.  No offense, but Vanna White, she makes millions of dollars to...  She doesn't even turn the letters anymore.  No, she just touches it and it lights up.  Because you know why they started that.  She screwed up a couple times.  Yeah.  So the makers of the show, Merv Griffin and them, they decided to make her job even easier  where all the... 
[00:18:00]  The letter lights up and she just touches it and then it shows you the letter.  In the old days, she had to spin the letter and she was spinning the wrong ones around.  I think the more important thing here...  Yeah.  ...is Vanna White should get his name and get a restraining order.  If that doesn't sound like a stalker, who cares about Vanna White?  Oh, yeah.  1027 WNEW, where rock lives.  The Rolling Stones, Sympathy for the Devil.  That's my favorite stone song, in case you care.  I know you don't.  I don't know why I said that, but there you go.  It's Opie and Anthony for The Ride Home. 
[00:18:30]  Thanks for checking us out.  We are up to ten people that actually enjoy the show  and we want to acknowledge those ten people out there in radio land.  Thank you very much.  That's ten more than we had on the first day.  Yes, we're gaining listeners every two or three days.  That's good.  Yeah, we're slowly but surely building some type of following.  I don't know why, but we'll get there eventually, right?  Okay.  Also, if you're a long-time smoker  and you've been trying to quit for years and years and years and years 
[00:19:00]  and you just have pretty much given up hope,  give us a call.  I think we could make you stop smoking today.  Right?  We'll get you to stop.  Yeah, Anthony's got a sure-fire way to get you to stop.  I'm serious.  So the phone line is 212-757-1027.  Also, Anthony, it's going to be a big weekend for you.  Fourth of July weekend.  Fourth of July weekend.  Plus, I know that you're a huge Star Trek fan.  Yes.  Huge.  Probably one of the biggest Star Trek fans, right?  The original Star Trek.  Not the new stuff, right? 
[00:19:30]  Well, I just don't get a chance to watch the new stuff.  But, yeah, the original is just a kick in the pants, you know.  It's pretty fun.  Well, Channel 11's going to have a Star Trek marathon this weekend.  I heard about that.  Where's that?  And the cool thing about this,  they allowed the fans to pick the top 25 episodes of all time.  They've got their website, www.wb11.com.  And the countdown is going to start on Friday at 9 a.m.  and go pretty much all weekend long.  Let's see if I agree with this. 
[00:20:00]  Well, what was your favorite Star Trek episode?  A couple of them.  Balance of Terror was a good one.  The Romulans.  Right.  The cloaking device.  Right.  And the Doomsday Machine was good.  The planet crunching device.  Did you like Spock's Brain?  No, Spock's Brain was horrible.  Well, that made the top ten.  Now, see, now that shouldn't be in there.  I'm looking at the list.  Where is Gamesters or Triskelion?  Now, that had a big blonde bombshell in a loincloth fighting Captain Kirk. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Captain Kirk, all man in that episode, too.  At one point, he belts her right in the mouth.  But it was for her own good because he had to get away.  Right.  And she was bringing him food or something in the cell.  And he kind of, like, laid into her and then, like, grabbed her head, you know,  gently put her down.  I know you're a beautiful woman, but I have to save my chip and crew. 
[00:21:00]  So what did you like about Spock's Brain, then?  Spock's Brain was horrible.  Didn't have phasers.  Right.  I want phasers.  You want phasers and nothing but phasers.  Okay.  Yeah.  A good episode like Gamesters or Triskelion.  And you had Kirk with the big blade.  And he's going at the girl on the, trying to slice.  Right.  You got the music.  Right, right, right.  And it's like,  I mean, that's great stuff.  Spock's Brain.  Great.  They go around with this robot remote control like Spock looking for his brain. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  It was terrible.  Did he like Space Speed?  Which one?  Space Speed with?  Space Speed.  Oh, yeah.  With Ricardo Montalban.  Right, right.  That was good.  And the movie after, Rathacon.  Great.  There you go.  Great movie.  What was the episode of Star Trek where the evil twin or whatever?  Mirror, mirror.  Mirror, mirror.  Yeah, yeah.  Where they beamed back up to the ship and they were the evil selves.  Right.  Yeah, horrible. 
[00:22:00]  That was something they did in sitcoms in the early days, like in the 60s and 70s especially.  Yeah.  Whenever a character had an evil twin, it was an easy makeup job.  They gave the character a goatee and a beret and now he's an evil guy.  Remember Gilligan's Island, the evil Gilligan?  He had the...  The evil Gilligan had...  He looked like a painter.  He had the goatee and the beret on and now he was the evil Gilligan.  I remember an evil Darren Stevens.  With the same thing. 
[00:22:30]  He had the goatee.  In the 60s, for the evil twin, you needed the goatee.  You're absolutely right.  And Spock had the goatee.  Right.  Unbelievable.  So...  That's good.  And if you're wondering, the number one episode chosen by the fans was The Trouble with Tribbles.  Is there any doubt, you think?  That was a great episode.  That was a good, fun episode.  Like, you know, kind of funny, but...  Right.  I don't think...  But now enough phasers for you?  I like battle episodes.  Klingons, Romulans, bring them on.  Because Kirk just fully pumped with testosterone. 
[00:23:00]  Fire!  Fire!  Lock on phasers.  Zulu.  Lock on phasers.  Fire.  Take a round.  I've got to save my...  ship.  1027 WNAW-FM.  The Rock of New York.  Wallflowers and heroes.  From the Godzilla movie soundtrack.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Created a lot of interest about Star Trek this afternoon. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I know.  1011's going to be running the Star Trek marathon starting Friday morning at 9 a.m.  They're going to play the top 25 episodes of all time, according to the Star Trek viewers.  Yeah.  They've had something going on their website where you can vote for your favorite Star Trek episode.  Jeez, Trekkies on the computer?  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  Boy, I never thought I'd see that.  Right.  But a bunch of people calling in and Anthony, they want to hear a little more Captain Kirk.  Really?  Yeah.  They liked your Captain Kirk impression here. 
[00:24:00]  I'm a standard.  The funny thing about Captain Kirk, you know, his acting was absolutely horrible.  I don't know how he got that job, actually.  He was.  He had to be the worst actor ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  I can't believe.  I can't believe.  I can't believe.  Stock here.  Dan.  Smart bones.  Smart bones.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  The Rock of New York.  The Rock of New York.  Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Blue on Black.  John Cafferty in there.  And Matchbox 20 and push. 
[00:24:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're looking at the instant feedback that we hooked up today, huh?  Yes, I am.  All you got to do is go to the N.E.W. website.  Of course, www.wnew.com.  You go to the Opie and Anthony section.  And you can actually type stuff in.  And I'm reading them as they come in.  Yeah, it's instant feedback.  I mean, we got the email and all that.  But, you know, we get into some interesting stuff on this show.  And people want to comment immediately.  Immediately.  So we're giving you that chance through the N.E.W. website. 
[00:25:00]  You can pop a note right into the studio.  Let me tell you what we have planned, too, in the coming months.  We were, like, cutting edge as far as Internet goes.  Yeah.  We had cameras in our previous studio.  So when we do things in here, bam, you saw it on the web.  Yes.  And there was some very interesting stuff going on.  Yeah.  We plan on doing here.  One step at a time, though.  Yeah.  But maybe someday we'll talk about what Wednesdays mean to you and I. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, that got us in trouble, too.  Yeah, it did.  All in due time, though.  Go ahead.  I'm reading one letter.  Opie, is that your real name?  No.  If it is, I apologize for the years of abuse you must have taken as a child.  Trust me.  I didn't make up this name.  And it's not a radio name.  I got it when I was, like, 11 or 12.  I was the only one.  I was the only one in sixth grade that didn't have a nickname.  And damn Julie Burson.  What did she do?  She decided I needed a nickname.  So it was between the kid from Lost in Space. 
[00:26:00]  Will Robinson.  Will Robinson.  And, like, Howdy Doody.  Oh, dear.  Yeah.  Come here, young boy.  Dear William.  Woo!  Yeah, I guess I hope he was better.  Yeah, it was much better.  So.  And, you know, a lot of people calling in and abusing me and stuff.  The How's that B line?  Heard it a million times.  And Anthony's heard the spaghetti line a million times.  How many times do I have to hear?  It's Wednesday.  Every Wednesday.  Hey, Anthony.  It's Prince Spaghetti Day. 
[00:26:30]  Right?  Right?  What?  I can't hear it.  Come closer.  What?  Right.  Is it Prince?  A little closer.  What?  You're up.  Exactly.  1027 WNEW where Rock lives.  Spin Doctors had two princes.  I gotta stop doing something.  It's Opie and Anthony, by the way.  What?  I can't talk anymore.  What's the problem?  Well, there's an espresso machine right outside the studio door that we've been taking advantage of today.  I know.  I've been drinking some of that, too.  Oh, my God.  Like, it's fantastic.  Love this stuff.  Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it. 
[00:27:00]  It should be outlawed, this stuff.  Mocha espresso.  Yeah.  It's like crystal meth.  It is.  What?  What's going on with that stuff?  I'm trying to slow down my brain, but it's not happening at all.  That's a...  See, I can't talk.  I know.  I'm, like, stuttering.  They got...  You can get regular espresso here, right?  You can get coffee here and the mocha espresso.  Mocha espresso is good, yeah.  Right.  All right.  Let me boot up to calm down here.  Relax.  Yes, okay.  Phones are ringing. 
[00:27:30]  You want to take another call here?  Sure.  Last call of the day?  We can do that, right?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, what's the total on people that like us?  We started...  Tote.  Well, we started the day with six people actually enjoying the Opie and Anthony show thus far.  Mm-hmm.  And, Anthony, what is the total as it comes to the end of another show here?  Opie, today, the total, 11.  We gained five listeners today?  We gained five listeners today that like us.  We have plenty of listeners that don't like us.  Oh, we're very aware of you guys.  Don't worry. 
[00:28:00]  You don't even have to call anymore.  We're very, very aware.  11 listeners.  Well, we got 11 people that actually enjoy the show.  Thank you.  Cool.  Let's go to the phones.  Let's go to the phones. </pre>
