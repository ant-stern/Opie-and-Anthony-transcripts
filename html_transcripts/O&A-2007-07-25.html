<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a defiant rejection of pressure to be “nice” on the radio, immediately transitioning into a discussion of the newly installed, unbolted, and weight-limited stripper pole in the studio.  E-Rock, wearing only his boxers, attempted to use it, resulting in much comedic commentary and Steve's efforts to stabilize the precarious pole.  Their Program Director, Tracy, was mentioned frequently, with anecdotes about her hugging the hosts and coating them in sparkly lotion.

The show then delved into current events, focusing on controversies surrounding Barry Bonds, Michael Vick, and an NBA referee's alleged mob ties.  The hosts debated the need for better officiating technology.  The recurring "Whip 'Em Out Wednesday" segment was referenced, alongside the "WOW" stickers and a related listener contest involving Joe Van Driver, who pulled over listeners with the stickers on their cars.  Significant time was also spent discussing a Jill TV segment and the outfits Jill wore, prompting ongoing bets between the hosts. A listener called in to describe a "WOW" encounter, and the hosts discussed the design process and issues with past and present WOW stickers.

The next segment opened with a humorous recounting of a disastrous promotional idea from a program director named "Pop-Tart Roger" – broadcasting from Madison Square Garden next to a giant Pop-Tart. This led to stories about Roger's alleged theft of company property.  The hosts then discussed audio clips of a laugh track overlaid on tragic news stories (Hindenburg, Terry Schiavo, Tammy Faye Bakker), connecting Tammy Faye's death to Jessica Hahn's resurfaced relevance and critiquing excessive cosmetic surgery. A “Guess the Sound” segment followed, with listener guesses ranging from Michael Vick drowning a dog to Terry Schiavo being assaulted. A new bit involving a randomly selected news story read by a random staff member unexpectedly led to a discussion of the Dandy-Walker complex.

The show then focused heavily on Bret Michaels' VH1 show, "Rock of Love," with detailed descriptions and clips.  The hosts discussed contestants' antics, particularly "Tiffany," deemed too “ugly” initially, only to return and exhibit drunken, inappropriate behavior.  The discussion broadened to other celebrity reality shows, their trends, and the irony of has-been celebrities' resurgence.  The segment concluded with a discussion about rotary phones versus iPhones and the hosts’ opinions on AT&T and Verizon.  Bill Burr was a guest in the studio during this portion; Bret Michaels and Chris Hansen were expected to call in later.

A humorous reading of rotary phone instructions opened the next segment, transitioning into a discussion about disappointing iPhone sales and their “What the Hell is That?” contest, showcasing unusual photos, including one of a pinky toe seemingly growing out of someone's nose.  Bill Burr remained in the studio. A call from Fez, promoting a gentlemen's club appearance with E-Rock, led to a discussion of lap dances and Fez potentially pole dancing on the show.

Bret Michaels eventually joined the show, discussing his reality show, highlighting its unscripted nature, memorable moments (a contestant's face plant, a medical device incident), and the 80s hair metal scene.

Bret Michaels remained a guest for another segment, detailing a Poison concert power failure, recounting numerous “Spinal Tap” moments from his career, and his encounters with other rock stars, including positive experiences with Kiss members and a negative interaction with an unnamed rocker.  The conversation turned to his reality show, *Rock of Love*, specifically the revelation that contestant Brandy C. was also a porn star.  Photos and videos were shown, and humorous commentary ensued.  Bill Burr appeared briefly as a fan of the show.  Michaels discussed his early career, challenges faced by 80s and 90s bands, his dating history (including Pam Anderson), and a fistfight with his bandmate, Bobby. The segment concluded with a listener-submitted *To Catch a Predator* clip,  and the hosts mocking negative online commenters using offensive language. A recording of Jimmy Norton's rendition of "Back in the New York Groove" played.


The final segment started with a replay of a previous show clip where a man's reaction to brownies seemed to indicate a connection to the show.  The hosts speculated on his motivations. An update on a friend, Voss, whose wife was about to give birth, followed.  A bizarre audio clip of Jimmy Norton singing was played.  A "mystery sound" segment ensued, with absurd guesses. A discussion of a mis-listed sexual assault hotline number connecting callers to a phone sex line followed. The segment culminated in an extremely vulgar and graphic rant by Jimmy Norton about "shooing an invalid," filled with offensive language and descriptions of abuse. The hosts reacted with amusement and disbelief.  The discussion turned to Johnny Cash's "Hurt,"  a MySpace page of a man from *To Catch a Predator*,  upcoming book signings, stand-up shows, and the repeated question: "What's your Opie and Anthony?"  Jimmy Norton was present in the studio alongside the regular hosts, with E-Rock mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah.  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator with all these problems?  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was. 
[00:01:00]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Words.  These are words.  These are words.  Just words coming out of your raid, Joe.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Morning.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  On this fine, whip them out Wednesday.  Yes.  On this fine, cat noise Wednesday.  No.  On this fine, butt rub Wednesday.  I might have to accept that.  Jimmy enjoys it so.  And on this fine, we're going to attempt it again this week.  Uh-oh.  You can't say that Wednesday.  Wednesday.  A complete and utter failure last week as the audience misunderstood the concept of you can't say that Wednesday. 
[00:02:00]  Was it as much of a failure as our Corey's interview yesterday?  Uh, maybe the same.  I'll put them on the same level.  No, that was good train wreck radio.  I disdain the two Corey's at this point.  That was good.  It was train wreck.  We almost had a perfect show yesterday.  And then the last 15, 20 minutes, the two Corey's came in and just, just effed it up for everybody. 
[00:02:30]  It was like a little insight on what is happening in the lives of two former child stars.  You know how they do their shows on VH1?  People love them.  They eat it up.  So then you get to see, or in this case, hear, and see if you're looking in on Pal Talk, what these guys are doing.  My God, man.  People love that nostalgia crap.  You know?  The VH1 shows and stuff.  They like seeing how people have fallen apart. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, can't get enough of them.  Makes you feel better about yourself, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Of course it does.  And we have to acknowledge the stripper pole in studio.  Yeah.  Our new PD, Tracy, she's out of her mind.  She's nuts.  We like her.  We like her.  I mean, John Minnelli would not approve of a stripper pole in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Probably one in his house.  Drinks his clinky ice drinks in the morning and maybe does a little dance. 
[00:03:30]  Who knows?  But Tracy got us a stripper pole.  It is in studio.  Unfortunately, we have nothing but guys around us.  Oh, that won't stop it from being used.  E-Rock?  I suggested that E-Rock has to try it.  Like, just one spin around the pole.  Oh, that's not even good.  But in his box, there's those big muscle man fans.  Oh, God.  This turns into the almost stripper pole. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, on cue, he walks in.  Yes.  Hello.  If a man's going to be on the stripper pole, I want to see it.  But it's like Laverne and Shirley.  You say something like, and then it was disgusting.  And Steve walks in.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes, Steve.  Oh, and Sam's got his camera.  Everyone's all geared up for use of the stripper pole.  E-Rock, would you do one, like, spin around the pole?  But you have to do it in your boxers. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, with your calves.  I want those calves.  Do you know how to do it?  Does anyone know how to do, like, a spin around the pole?  I'll talk Eric through it.  I heard, like, the stripper pole's in the studio, but it's not weighted yet.  Oh, really?  Is there something?  I can hold it down.  What?  You can hold it down?  It's not bolted down or something?  What's the problem, Steve?  It's not bolted down, Anthony.  No.  It's not bolted down.  I'm good if it tips over him.  He falls on his ass.  We can sit on the corners, unless you hand him dollars.  Oh, what?  They have to, like, drill it into the floor? 
[00:05:00]  I guess, or at least sandbag it for something to keep it stable.  And the weight limit is, once it is weighted down, will only be 250 pounds.  Oh, no.  You better go on it today.  You mean some 300-pound slob wants to come in?  That would be hilarious.  That's the type of thing we would do, though.  That would be worth breaking it over.  Just watch it bend.  Big slob on the end of it.  Well, you know what?  This is not attached to the ceiling, so it's like a freestanding pole.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  The higher you get.  Oh, look at that thing.  That thing's going down today.  See, it's the principles of leverage.  The higher you get on the pole, the more unstable the base is going to become.  Eric won't do any tricks, then.  No tricks?  Well, I'd like to see him do a spin.  Yeah, we just want one lousy, dumb spin.  I'd like to.  Maybe it's the music, man.  We have to have some music for him.  We can't just expect this kid to be sexy.  We got Bret Michaels coming in, so we could do a little poison or something.  Poison is alive and well in the strip club. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, Tracy got this for us, but she doesn't know some of the basics.  She's really pretty smart about some things, but some of the basic things, she's just oblivious to it.  Like what?  Oblivious.  Like what?  Yesterday, we were talking about the ratings, and we really had a good ratings book for spring here in New York.  Good.  It was amazing.  Super duper.  How about number one in men? 
[00:06:30]  Yep.  Pretty much across the board.  Yep.  Number one.  Numero uno, my friend.  I think one of the demos we were number two, but number one across the board.  Yep.  And so she decides, hey, oh man, that was great, you know, and we're like, yeah.  She goes, how about a hug?  All right.  Give her a little hug.  Get done with the hug and realize she's wearing that lotion or something with sparkles in it.  So now you're covered in the you can't go home sparkles. 
[00:07:00]  It's like stripper sparkles.  Yeah.  When did all the hugs happen?  Oh, that was in production.  That started yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  We're moving forward fast here with her.  Yeah.  I'm very bothered.  You didn't get a hug?  You two.  Oh.  I'd like to get the sparkles.  Would have gotten the sparkles.  Oh, Steve's hugging you.  Look.  But it's not normal to get stripper sparkles from your boss.  No.  Doesn't anyone understand what's going on here?  What the hell's going on?  Stripper sparkles.  We're getting stripper sparkles on us now. 
[00:07:30]  She's our boss, technically.  Ladies don't realize those things are like tags.  Yeah, you can't.  They're like stripper tags.  They put them on you, and then you might think they're all gone.  And then you go home, and one little beam of the light from the TV will hit it, and you'll  go off like a disco ball.  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell was that?  And you got, like, glitter on you.  Oh, that's just great.  I see what you're doing at lunchtime.  No, it's my boss. 
[00:08:00]  She wears strippers.  It's the boss.  How do you explain that?  Ah, the boss.  It's the boss.  Just hugging us over good ratings.  This isn't what you think.  This is a ratings celebration.  Right.  A ratings celebration.  Oh, it looks like I see someone with clothes on.  E-Rock, why haven't you been prepared?  See, the whole glitter break that we just did was just off the cuff timing-wise to get 
[00:08:30]  you prepared to do your little pole dance.  Yeah, just a quick spin.  We want to see.  Look at his face.  He's smiling.  He's a little shy and embarrassed, yet there's this little anticipation on his face.  He's like, I've never done this, and I'm excited.  He's like a housewife about to go out and strip.  He feels fun.  He feels sassy.  Yeah, a little sassy.  Hasn't felt this sexy in years.  All right, let's get girls, girls, girls revved up for a while.  Oh, come on. 
[00:09:00]  Let me hear a little girls, girls, girls.  Oh, yeah.  This is nice.  All right, E-Rock is in his boxers.  Sure is.  The Motley Crue.  Wait, we're going to have to hold the thing down.  Oh, God.  Where's Steve?  Yeah, he's got his shirt on.  Why?  Hold on, E-Rock.  Oh, God.  What is this?  We just go with the bit.  What are you wearing his shirt for?  Yeah, just take your shirt off.  It's in your boxers.  Oh, Steve's going to be underneath holding it down. 
[00:09:30]  All right, Tim, hold down the stripper pole.  Yeah, do it like that.  Why would they set this up without anchoring it down, knowing we would have to do something with this?  Steve looks like he's at one of the tables at the strip club.  What is he doing?  Oh, he's weighing it down.  All right.  Well, E-Rock, maybe you could get on the pole, go around it a couple times, and then take your shirt off as you're up there dancing.  You should bring your own towel on stage and lay it back.  This is terrible. 
[00:10:00]  Is he taking his shirt off or what?  Of course he is.  I don't want to be the one screaming that he needs his shirt off.  Someone else help me out here.  Help me out here, Hammer.  Take your shirt off, Hammer.  There we go.  I had to give the Pell Talk audience a little treat.  A quickie, Ralph, on instant feedback.  We'll talk about Jill TV in a second.  We almost had an epileptic seizure today.  Epileptic?  Epileptic seizure today because of what she's wearing. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  But first, E-Rock.  I tried out the new stripper pole that Tracy, the PD of this fine station in New York, got for us.  Did she get it because we had great ratings?  No, she probably wants something to do for herself after we leave.  She's bored because she comes in and dances, hangs out.  All right.  Here we go.  Start up the music.  Well, we need the big announcement coming to the stage, Anthony.  All right.  Can we do an echo or?  Oh, that's nice.  Ladies and gentlemen, making his way to the stage. 
[00:11:00]  You might have seen him screwing up here on the O&A show.  It's E-Rock.  Pick out for E-Rock, ladies and gentlemen.  E-Rock.  All righty.  Let's see what you got.  Oh, he's spinning.  I think that thing's going to be broken in one day.  He just did the one-arm swing.  That was a one-arm swing.  A 360-degree turn there.  Now, do you know how to do it where you wrap your leg around it and slide down to the floor? 
[00:11:30]  You've been in strip clubs.  You've got to lift your feet above your head.  That's a guy.  See, wrap one leg around it.  Like that.  Right.  And then you spin around and kind of bend your legs and go all the way to the floor so Steve gets the treat.  Maybe something will pop out one of those pant legs.  A little oopsie for Steve.  Steve's got money out.  Oh, is this rude?  Yeah, for sure.  All right. 
[00:12:00]  Come on, E-Rock.  What do you got?  Oh, there he goes.  He's on the floor.  And Steve is putting a dollar in his shorts.  Oh, God.  All right.  Now lose the shirt, honey.  Yeah, lose that shirt, baby girl.  Yeah, if you want...  Oh, the camera's rolling.  He said that for a single.  Yeah, that was for a single.  If you want real money, you're going to have to lose that shirt.  The camera's rolling.  E-Rock did a...  I don't know.  I think he spun around twice with his legs wrapped around the pole. 
[00:12:30]  Sam's figured it out.  If he holds the camera, he doesn't have to do anything.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a genius.  And poor E-Rock is up here on the pole.  How does it feel, E-Rock?  It feels like this thing is going to collapse.  You swing and you think it's just going to start tipping over.  I probably will.  That would be hysterical.  Oh, and I'd love to see it snap and him fly through the window and plummet to his death.  His parents would have to find him like that. 
[00:13:00]  They'd have to bury him with a stripper pole in his hand and his undershorts.  All right, let's go.  A tragedy in the Nagel family today.  Oh, Jesus.  He's spinning.  Oh, he's getting a little more rambunctious up there.  Oh, here he comes.  This is the moment we're waiting for.  What?  Yeah, there goes that shirt.  Oh, God.  Oh, there goes.  God, nice.  Yeah.  Oh, he's throwing it at Steve.  This is gay, man.  This is so gay. 
[00:13:30]  It's not gay.  Come on, who's tenting?  Funny or gay?  What is this?  This is gay.  Is it just gay?  It's pretty funny, but.  Hey, but take your shirt off.  I mean, you know.  We're going to get the video right.  What are you doing?  What happened?  One spin with the shirt off.  You have to.  You look good.  A spin with the shirt off.  You're just saying how gay this is.  And they're like, wait.  Put the shirt back off.  We still got to do radio, though.  One more spin.  I just want to acknowledge it's gay, but we're doing it.  Dude, what the hell?  Jesus.  There's more than a pole here in the studio. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, there he is.  Oh, he almost slipped.  He's wearing his white socks, and the stage is a little slippery.  Maybe that's because of Steve.  What are you doing down there, Steve?  All right, well, there you go.  E-Rock.  Yes, E-Rock.  That's Tracy the PD here in New York.  Let's hear it for E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, remember to tip your dancers and your boyatresses and bartenders.  Wonderful.  That's just wonderful.  That was horrid. 
[00:14:30]  That was horrific.  Very scary.  I really want that people snapping him just to fall on the carpet in his undershorts.  All right, our phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  They're already sharing photos.  I love this age we're in.  Oh, nice.  Get the pictures up on the website.  Yeah, of course it has to be a guy that tries out the stripper pole for the first time.  For the first time.  Why would it be any different?  And we would invite ladies down immediately to do it as well, but we've got to anchor this down.  Or someone's going to, like, break their neck. 
[00:15:00]  Without the pole being, like, anchored into the ceiling, it's almost impossible.  Because no matter how well you anchor that down, that pole is going to waver.  Yeah.  Hey, we've got your Barry Bonds update.  Barry Bonds update, everybody.  Two homers away.  Yes, he's two homers away.  From tying Hank Aaron, three from breaking the record.  He went 1-4-5 last night.  One walk and two strikeouts.  No home runs for Barry Bonds last night.  Whoopsie.  Nobody wants to be the one who wants to give it up to him.  Nobody wants to be the one who wants to give it up to him. 
[00:15:30]  Just, I would love them to just bean him every time.  Just bean him.  Right in the fanny.  A nice, innocent bean.  They should just play fanny ball.  Every time he comes up, they all have decided around the leagues that they need to hit him in the fanny.  The fanny.  Every time he comes up, just hit him in the fanny.  Don't say fanny.  For the rest of this year.  Hit him in the fanny.  And for the rest of next year until he gets the hint that he's not allowed to break the record.  Just keep hitting him in the fanny night after night after night after night. 
[00:16:00]  A lot of, you know what's interesting, sports is all effed up.  Has anyone else noticed this?  You got Barry Bonds, who they're saying may be indicted by September for the steroid thing.  Yeah.  You got Michael Vick just effing up the NFL.  And then you got the ref messing up the NBA with his ties to the mob.  That's a big one.  And the gambling.  I think you will find this guy dead at some point.  He has resigned, obviously.  Yeah, well.  And, yeah, David Stern looked really sad during that press conference yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  Because David Stern comes across as very cocky.  You know, he finds Mark Cuban almost weekly.  And Mark Cuban's been yelling and screaming about the refereeing for years.  Yeah.  And David Stern, I think he's going to have to step down on this.  Step down because it was under his tenure.  I think you're seeing the last days of David Stern.  I think he's going to have no choice.  I don't know.  I'm sure it goes on in all professional sports.  This guy got caught.  But this is one more push for replay to me. 
[00:17:00]  It's one more reason that replay has to be used whenever it can be.  Because that's something that you can't mess with as much when the replay is being used.  They messed up replay like they messed up everything else.  Replay sounds like the easiest concept whatsoever.  But then they introduced all these rules around it where it made it impossible to use the most simplest of technology.  Why couldn't they just say, yeah, we're going with the replay.  That's easy enough. 
[00:17:30]  If there's a dispute, you check it out.  And no rules.  Here's the play.  Right.  You're the ref or the ump.  No, they had to add a bunch of rules to it, which makes it a pain in the ass.  Right.  It's the simplest thing.  They should just bring it back.  I agree with Jimmy.  And just let the refs and the umps have at it.  They get to see the play, and then they make their decision based on just what they're seeing.  No rules or any of that crap around it.  People always feel, though, that you need that human factor in these games where there has to be the ref with the human factor, the element of, you know, fallibility. 
[00:18:00]  These guys can make mistakes, and it does affect the game, but that is part of the game.  Yeah.  And then there's the other people that want it, you know, mechanized, where there's cameras everywhere to check and make sure, and it kind of takes the human element out of the game.  But, you know, I think it would eliminate these guys, guys that are betting on the games and then refereeing the games. 
[00:18:30]  Jesus.  Yeah, it's time to update the sports.  I mean, you've got the easy pass technology.  Yeah.  Why can't you use that in baseball?  Why can't you just use that in baseball?  It would be obvious if the ball got there first or the runner.  Oh, you mean put, like, sensors on the ball, the runners, and the bases.  Yes.  Yes.  Sounds like the simplest thing to do.  Yeah.  You would never have a blown call at first base ever.  You don't even use a first base, and you actually have to throw the ball at the guy as he's running. 
[00:19:00]  I like that.  What's Stan got?  Well, I know nobody cares about it quite as much, but tennis has a perfect system.  A perfect system.  Yeah, rich people and homosexuals enjoy it.  Well.  All right.  But they have a—  You can knock your teeth out.  Stan's a big tennis fan.  Not Russian chicks.  He's going to knock your teeth out.  You can't be a tennis fan.  He might play because he's an athlete.  He's a huge tennis—  Name a few tennis players, Stan.  Let's go.  Well, James Blake.  How about one of the hot ones? 
[00:19:30]  Maria Sharapova.  Ah, yes.  Yeah.  There you go.  Why would you go with James Blake for it?  I know.  You go with James Blake.  Get on that pole.  I'm going to go with the obvious ones.  But yeah, they have a system.  Why go with the ones that everyone does know?  Yeah.  But they wouldn't demonstrate tennis knowledge is what I'm saying.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Instead of the hotness that might be there.  That might entertain or at least titillate the fans.  Right.  But yeah, who cares what I'm going to say now because you guys don't care. 
[00:20:00]  But what is it?  They have a system that it's anytime a player doesn't agree with a call, they just challenge  it and they go to a system that measures it within like three thousandths of an inch  or something.  Well, that is the perfect system.  Yeah.  And that is the last word in terms of the call.  There's no—  No more yelling at the—  There's no more human factor to it.  The line judge or anything?  Yeah.  But it was fun when McEnroe would yell and scream.  Oh, yeah.  When he thought a play was—  See?  People enjoyed that more than they do this technology that kind of makes it, well, we 
[00:20:30]  know exactly what happened here.  They kind of like that with McEnroe where he used to scream, you know, what the hell are  you talking about?  That was in!  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  You know, people enjoyed that.  How often is the ref right or how often is the player right, would you say?  The player's right most of the time, actually.  Really?  Yeah.  I can hear that perspective's a little closer.  Yeah.  They just know they hit the ball so much.  All right.  That's part of the game.  Hitting the ball a lot. 
[00:21:00]  Well, Moe in Brooklyn, he writes, Ope, you used to work for the NBA, and I think you're  way off on Stern resigning.  He would only go if the owners turn on him, and they won't because he's made them huge  money.  We'll have to wait and see.  He looked like—he looked like, you know, like crap yesterday during that press conference.  I don't think he'll go because it's like it could happen in any sport.  It's almost like it could happen after him, too.  Yeah, but there was something where they were—I've got to get my info, but they were looking  into this back in 2005.  Yeah, they were kind of on to this whole thing.  And David Stern said, yeah, I kind of messed up. 
[00:21:30]  We came up empty on our investigation back in 2005 or something like that.  So there's a bit of a history there that are making people raise their eyebrows a bit  today.  Did he—are they—have they shown any calls that he made that were like just blatantly,  oh my God, what the hell is this guy doing?  They're going—well, David Stern said he's going to go through every game this guy.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, reffed.  His stats are way up, though. 
[00:22:00]  Like, he called way more fouls than, you know, for one team than another.  It was way off balance in so many games.  And that's how games are decided, you know, on the free throw line for the most part.  I think he also gave out more technicals than anybody else.  More technicals.  So not only was he making bad calls, but then if you argued about them because you knew  they were bad, he would get you chucked out of the game with technicals.  And if you're a scorer, boy, if you're a high scorer, that's it.  You pretty much know who's going to win.  Well, they talked to a lot of guys in the NBA, like coaches and stuff, and they said  it would be so easy to control these games. 
[00:22:30]  You just, you know, get the star player in foul trouble early, and there you go.  There you go.  You're guaranteeing that, you know, the odds are way in your favor as far as winning that game.  Yeah, they've got to sit Shaquille maybe for the first half of the fourth quarter, or  they've got to sit Colby.  Well, they go even earlier because then, you know, you're very, very timid the rest of  the game.  So basketball seems to be easy to fix with the refs.  You get the star player—  You get the star player in foul trouble early, and if that's not helping, then you start  calling, you know, a lot of fouls later in the game for the other team. 
[00:23:00]  So they go to the line a lot.  How could you do that without it being obvious?  Basketball's like—basketball's such an odd game.  Whenever I used—and I don't enjoy the game at all, and I never liked playing it because  it was always very vague, the rules of where your hands could go when you're trying to  block or get the ball.  That's why it's easy in the NBA.  Like, baseball, you know, it's either a ball or strike.  You know, you're going to have, like, you know, someone come running out like Lupinello 
[00:23:30]  or something arguing balls and strikes, of course.  Yeah.  But it's going to be within the strike zone.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not going to start calling, like, strikes that are three feet outside the strike zone.  Like, time and time again.  But in the NBA, there's so much action.  You could call a foul on every play.  Yep.  Right?  Every play, you can literally call a foul.  So it's really hard to see if this guy is calling, you know, too many fouls for a team.  They're constantly banging into each other on the board.  There's always contact.  I think it's the toughest, you know, sport to, you know, to ref, ump, whatever. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it's a little too vague for me.  The whole line where you, you know, it was always, I could never play the game either.  It was one of those things where I was always fouling.  Like, I'd try to steal the ball away and I'd reach in and just hit it.  Oh, you can't do that.  Why?  Because the guy's back is to me.  Why can't I just reach in and smack the ball?  What's that called?  Reaching in.  Is it?  What's that called?  It's called reaching in? 
[00:24:30]  What a stupid rule.  If I'm able to do it, why can't I reach in?  You're so used to getting a reach around.  A reach around.  Oh.  All right.  So that's.  That's funny.  It's called reaching.  And of course it is.  What else would it be called?  I'm a dolt.  All right.  With that, why don't we take a break?  We're a little late here because E-Rock, you know, spinning on the stripper.  Yeah.  Well, well worth it.  877-212-ON-A.  Write that number down.  Okay.  Well, we'll talk about the sports thing a little bit and definitely a lot of other stuff. 
[00:25:00]  Uh, we're still trying to figure it out for today.  Let's be honest.  But we'll give you some fine radio.  Guaranteed.  That's a guarantee from Opie and Anthony.  Oh, wow.  We'll be back.  Time to wake up, mother effers.  Don't wake everybody up.  Why?  We need listeners.  Wake the F up.  Because I'm looking at pal talk right now.  Trish, call your friends and wake everybody up, will ya?  Cool.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on this fine Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wow.  What's going on with Whip Em Out Wednesday? 
[00:25:30]  I gotta be honest with you.  Yeah.  I think we've downplayed Wow for way too long.  We gotta bring Wow back.  It must come back.  It must come back.  In full force.  Uh, talking to Tracy the other day, she said, uh, yeah, you guys need to bring Wow back.  And she's getting brand new Wow stickers made because the station here in New York especially  changed formats again.  So they're gonna have, uh, some Wow stickers in the near future.  That's what we need.  More Wow stickers.  More girls wowing. 
[00:26:00]  And what are you looking at?  I'm looking on a pal talk.  And, uh, there's somebody in here called Boobs.  Boobs.  And, um.  Studio cam here.  Can I tell you something?  I now, I'm now looking at what you're looking at?  Yeah.  That is really hot.  She's sleeping.  There's something really hot about that.  She's asleep.  She's completely out.  And, uh.  She's got a webcam on her, uh, on her body from like the belly button up. 
[00:26:30]  Well, she's in bed.  She's asleep in bed.  She's got the sheet.  I wasn't sure if that was a bed or a couch.  It looks like her bed.  Yeah, you're right.  She's got her sheet pulled up to about her belly button.  And then her arm is kind of crossed around her stomach.  And just below her breasts, uh, which are bare.  Just bare.  Right there.  She's, uh.  She sleeps nude, I gather.  Yeah.  And she's just covered with a sheet, um, up to her belly button.  And she's just snoozing right there.  Giving us a little whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:27:00]  Uh.  And she don't even know it.  She's in dreamy land.  The boobs are breathing on their own.  They're just breathing as she sleeps.  There is something pretty hot about just looking in on a naked sleeping girl.  Yeah.  God bless, uh, Pal Talk.  Wow.  Wow.  Never went away on Pal Talk.  Wow.  And it's really time to get it, uh, going on the streets again.  It's real simple.  Real simple.  A lot of the radio stations we're on, uh, they have wow stickers.  You put one on the back of your car and now you're in it.  Now you're in it.  Yep.  And it could happen at any moment. 
[00:27:30]  It could happen today.  It could happen a month from now.  You never know.  But we've had thousands upon thousands of winners.  Other radio stations, they give you a prize.  Ah, they get one dumb winner.  We give, we give people thousands.  Thousands.  Yeah.  You ever see that?  They've put a sticker on your car and if we find you in our van and you have the right  license plate number and you say the phrase that pays and whatever it is, we'll give  you a chance to win.  Well, what the hell is that?  This one, you just slap a sticker on and you win the gift of boobage. 
[00:28:00]  That, that, uh, that's, that, that never worked in radio, by the way.  All of a sudden there's, uh, you know, Joe Van Driver.  Hey, his name is Joe Van Driver.  Hey, Joe Van Driver will be out looking for you and your sticker.  And if he pulls you over, he's got, he's got front row tickets to see Molly Hatchet at  the forum.  Next thing you know, you're just trying to go to work, you're late for an appointment  and you got some, some long haired dope in a van trying to pull you over and you're like,  get the hell away from me, man. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, hey, but it's Joe Van Driver.  Joe Van Driver.  This is my only job at the station to pull over listeners.  What a coincidence.  My name is Van Driver.  My last name, Van Driver.  And I'm the Van Driver.  Get it?  Yeah, we get it.  You're a loser.  He's in an old school van with the, with the radio station logo on the side, beeping,  trying to, trying to stop you.  Hey, pull over.  You're like, look, man, I got to go pick up my kids.  I, you know, I, I, someone just handed me the sticker leaving a, leaving a sporting event. 
[00:29:00]  Leave me alone.  I don't want it.  I don't want to be part of the pull, pull me over contest.  Yeah.  I'm busy.  But I'm Joe Van Driver.  I got to sit on the side of the road with Joe Van Driver until the jocks through with  his five songs in a row so I could get on the air with him.  I'm late.  Right.  I'm late.  So what do you think of Joe Van Driver pulling you over?  It's I'm late.  I'm late.  He sounds pretty excited.  And Joe Van Driver, when he's not on the air, sounds kind of like, yeah, you know, you  and me.  Yeah.  And then, uh, you know, you got animal back at the station. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Animal.  This is animal.  And we're going to go to Joe Van Driver.  Joe, what's going on?  Well, we're here on the side of the city park.  Well, hey, we've just pulled over.  What's your name, sir?  Dan.  Dan, we've got him in here.  Time out.  Yeah.  I already established the voice of Joe Van Driver.  Then why couldn't I be animal?  You could be animal.  I'll be Joe Van Driver.  All right.  Joe Van Driver.  Wait, what's your radio name?  Animal.  But you don't sound like animal.  Who could I be?  You sound more like a, uh, like one of those breezy type radio stations. 
[00:30:00]  Do they have Joe Van Driver?  No.  Joe Van Driver works for.  Like a rock station.  No.  Joe Van Driver works for a station like, uh, uh, classic rock that really rocks.  Classic.  Oh, butt rock.  I gotcha.  70s butt rock.  All right.  So he's got like this kind of voice.  A little gravelly.  A little deep.  Yeah.  You've, you're, you're like, you're, you're, you're, you're listening with the animal today.  Yeah.  You want to be animal.  Think Scorch. 
[00:30:30]  Think Scorch back in the day.  Scorch.  You're right.  Hey, hey, hey.  But don't rip off Scorch.  Oh, oh, okay.  Because he does the kingdom of, uh, nakedness.  Oh, this is tough.  He does kingdom of nakedness.  This is an actual guy, by the way.  Scorch.  We love the guy.  Where is he these days?  Scorch.  He's in New Hampshire now?  In New Hampshire.  Spreading the kingdom of nakedness.  It's not spreading if you move from one place to another without leaving anything behind.  So picture Scorch.  Scorch.  But you're animal.  I'm animal.  Which is a little different.  And now you, you're at a station called Classic Rock That Really Rocks. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Maybe the station's called The Wolverine.  Hey, you're listening to The Wolverine.  You're animal.  I'm animal on The Wolverine.  It's 640.  It's time to go to Joe Van Driver out on the street and see if he's, uh, pulled over any  of our lucky, uh, people that are wearing a bumper sticker.  Wearing the, uh, Wolverine bumper sticker on their bumpers.  And, uh, let's go to Joe Van Driver right now.  Joe, how you doing out there?  What's up, animal?  Hey, how you doing, Joe Van Driver?  I'm doing all right.  This is Joe Van Driver on the side of the Southern State Parkway. 
[00:31:30]  So who do you got over there?  You find someone with a, uh, Wolverine sticker?  Not yet.  I'm in hot pursuit.  I'm a minivan.  Minivan.  And he's got a sticker.  He sure has.  But for some reason he keeps driving faster than I can drive in this crappy van.  Well, go get him, Joe Van Driver.  You got to give him the prize.  What's the prize today?  Uh, front row tickets of Molly Hatch.  Molly Hatch are going to be playing, uh, this weekend.  And, uh, Bennington's gift certificate.  Fantastic, Joe.  But I can't stop this minivan.  Catch up to him. 
[00:32:00]  For some reason, I don't think they give a crap about this promotion.  This is exciting.  All right, back to you, Animal.  What do you got?  What do you got on your show today?  All right, well, we're going to be rocking it with plenty of classic rock.  And then, uh, it is, uh, Cat Meow Wednesday.  So, uh, we're going to check back with you, Joe Van Driver, in about ten minutes.  Hopefully you'll have that guy pulled over and give him the prize of Molly Hatch tickets.  All right, call back when you're doing the five o'clock traffic drive.  You got it, Joe Van Driver. 
[00:32:30]  And we continue with the rock here on the Wolverine.  Joe Van Driver, classic rock.  That really rocks.  That really rocks.  Len Zeppelin.  Stupid radio promotions.  Most of them suck.  That's why we came up with Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I'm getting a call.  Q104 wants to hire us.  Yeah.  Stupid radio promotions.  Wow's easy.  You throw the wow sticker on your car.  What it does, it supports the, uh, the Opie and Anthony show.  Right there. 
[00:33:00]  It supports the show.  And then you just go about your life.  Look, we're not trying to bother you.  And then one day, you might be driving to work, and all of a sudden, some lady decides,  wow, cool, I like that radio show, and I know what this Whip Him Out Wednesday is all about.  And the next thing you know, they're flashing you.  And you win.  That's it.  No Van Driver.  No Joe Van Driver.  No speeding tickets.  No stopping.  Because you're trying to get away from Joe Van Driver.  And believe me, looking at lovely breasts on your, uh, miserable commute is a lot better  than, uh, Molly Hatchet tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  So.  Not as good at looking at them, though, on CW11.  Ah, yes.  We'll get into that.  So, yeah.  Show TV.  And if you don't have a WOW sticker, you can write it on the back of your car and make  a homemade, uh, WOW sign.  So Whip Him Out Wednesday, that's what WOW stands for.  And ladies, please help us out with the whole thing.  And guys, if you do get WOWed, ah, that's all the girl wants.  Just leave her alone and go about your business, okay?  Oh, yeah.  It's just, once it's done, it's done.  You move on.  You have a smile on your face.  It's a wonderful day.  Right.  You could ask the listeners to call in with their Party Patrol drivers from their cheesy local 
[00:34:00]  stations.  Party Patrol.  Ooh.  Ooh, E-Rock.  Oh, Party Patrol.  Like, what are you, looking for a party?  Yeah.  Hey, and they gotta sound like there's a party going on no matter where they are.  There's nothing.  I've never stumbled on a party while driving.  Ever.  Hey, I'm driving around.  It's just, uh, Party Patrol.  Here's a-  Shut up.  Oh, I can't.  Uh, Party Patrol.  We're having a great time on the-  Oh, jeez.  Hold on a minute. 
[00:34:30]  It just has to-  Where-  Where-  I would hear the Party Patrol, and, uh, boy, what a party going on there.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Where-  Whoa!  Oh.  Oh my God, someone call an ambulance.  Unless your radio station includes, like, Lindsay Lohan in your Party Patrol.  Right.  Don't do it.  It's not a party patrol.  Uh, at a station I was at, his name was Cliff. 
[00:35:00]  They called him Clifford the Big Red Intern.  Oh.  Gah.  Yuck.  I'm a bit nauseous from that one.  All right, Jimmy, I interrupted you.  I'm sorry.  But Ralph brought this to our attention.  We said in the office, uh, Opie, Jill TV is killing me.  This may be the best she has looked, you think?  Did you take a, uh, a screen cap today, E-Rock?  You did.  It's a little hard, because the way her shirt is with that blue background screws up the camera.  Yeah.  She, like, she, she wore something that's, uh, not very TV friendly. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  They check that before she goes on, and they normally will do that, where they'll put a  camera, like, you give it to wardrobe, and they check it.  Carson used to wear suits like that once in a while.  They bounce.  They, like, they're wearing metal.  You can't have something with very thin diagonals, lines on it like that, because, uh, you know,  the TV can't handle it.  It just freaks out.  Yeah.  It's like, it gets scared.  My eyes are all messed up from looking at her, and her boobs look huge today in that blue thing.  Ben commented, if you look at her dress long enough, you'll see a sailing ship. 
[00:36:00]  It's definitely one of those.  Yeah, that's the type of it.  It's definitely one of those, uh, little outfits she's wearing.  But it looks hot.  Looks hot as hell.  And, uh, we're still keeping track.  How many, how many screen caps do we have of Jill at this point?  Can we get a number?  I'll find out.  Here we go.  When she finally wears the same outfit that she has worn at some point before.  You know what?  I think the listeners could get involved, because, you know, ooh, ooh, 28.  28?  28 screen caps and, and not, not, uh, not the same outfit yet, right? 
[00:36:30]  Nope.  28 different outfits.  We should, we should, uh, we should bet.  I'll, uh, yeah, I'm more than willing to bet.  Of course you are.  Some money.  Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet.  Of course you're willing to bet.  20 bucks.  Is someone keeping track of all the bets we got going?  That's the new thing on this show.  I think we got two bets. 
[00:37:00]  I lost yesterday's.  That guy was dead?  No, that one's still up in the air.  What was the other one you lost?  I don't know about that one.  I lost the one about the family that was the doctor's family.  I said I would take both your bets, so my hand is out waiting.  I didn't see your money.  Get the tape from yesterday.  I didn't see your money.  Were they Russians?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I meant.  Me too.  No, you didn't.  It was very cold.  What did we say?  Get the tape, exactly.  Get the tape. 
[00:37:30]  You said you lost, though, and you were betting against me.  No, no.  No one else bet you.  I was saying.  You just said on the air that you lost.  I thought I did until Jimmy just said they were Russian, because I thought they were Yugoslavian.  And then when he said they were Russian, I went, oh, okay.  Now I know they're.  All right.  Just move on.  How about the latest bet?  The latest bet.  How many days is Jill going to go before she has to, has to wear the same outfit? 
[00:38:00]  We're up to 28 days, 28 different outfits.  Well.  And the listeners can have fun with this on some of the sites.  I'll give her.  All the screen caps, by the way, are on our website.  I'm only going to give her, and you can't go days.  You have to go, like, you know, performances.  Right.  Well, that's what I mean.  How many times she's on camera.  So she's been on camera 28 times or whatever, 28 different days, and she hasn't worn the same outfit.  But I'm only giving her two more appearances in even 30 days. 
[00:38:30]  30 days.  Yeah, because I got to figure 28 days, she's probably having that time.  And one of the outfits might need to be washed.  Do you think she has a period piece?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you think she has that one?  Yeah, there's one dress that she wears every once a month, just in case.  When she's having her time?  Yeah, it's one that covers up any bloating.  And you're not afraid if, you know, you got to put a little shout on it. 
[00:39:00]  Maybe to shout out something.  That's all I'm saying.  So she's probably got that dress.  Wait, wait.  Wait, what are we laughing at?  What happened?  Oh, all right.  Opie, correction on Jill.  We have 28 screen caps, but about seven outfits.  What are you talking about?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What do you mean? 
[00:39:30]  When you asked about how many caps we have, I said we had 28.  We don't have 28 different outfits.  I thought you were taking a picture of her every time she's on TV.  Yes, but she also has a lot of days off, too.  We've only taken seven pictures, so that's only seven appearances?  No, hold on.  I'll show you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I don't know.  How could E-Rock have screwed this up?  So why weren't you taking pictures of her every day, even when she's there?  She hasn't been off 21 out of 28 days.  If you have 28 screen caps, she's not.  See, there's days where you just got pictures of other people. 
[00:40:00]  Basically, there's a lot of days you decide not to get the screen cap.  Because we started this bit a long time ago.  You're trying to tell me she's only been on...  Hey, wow, she looked awful that day.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, that was Jimmy Norton.  Right.  She looked good.  She looked adorable.  So how many...  All right.  We're seeing the same outfit just because it's the same day.  Yeah.  So you're snapping maybe earlier in the newscast and then midway through the newscast.  All right.  That's fine.  All right.  But wait, what days are you not snapping pictures of her? 
[00:40:30]  You only have seven days of screen caps?  Or seven appearances.  Seven appearances.  So that means you're not taking her picture every day.  I try to get her every time that she's on.  There's times that she's not there and then we don't get the photos.  Well, we don't need her every time she's on.  We just need her.  We started this bit a long time ago.  And you're trying to tell me we only have seven appearances on the website.  We also had a vacation.  We were also in Philly.  So there's certain things that we don't have enough.  No, you just forgot some days.  You've shirked your responsibility.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  You've shirked it.  Don't get the listeners involved.  They'll tell you exactly when we started the bit and they'll tell you how many days she's had off since.  And they'll have it all figured out in seconds.  Well, that sucks because we want to see how many appearances she goes before she has to wear something twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sort through those.  All right.  Well, we might not be able to do that.  No.  I wanted to bet.  Hey, who's this?  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah, hello.  What's your name, bro?  Hi, this is Jerry. 
[00:41:30]  Happy bike.  I'm calling from Rochester, New York.  I'm on the road here heading towards Syracuse.  And I just got wowed here a few miles back by two lovely young ladies in a silver BMW.  Oh, there you go.  See, just in case you didn't think this was going on, it happens all the time, especially on Wednesdays.  Yeah, and it was a driver behind me had the wow sticker on the back of his truck, and it worked for both of us.  There you go.  See, I would just put a wow on my car if I was out there. 
[00:42:00]  And was it nice?  Oh, absolutely flawless.  It was a doubleheader.  See, he got two.  Two lovelies in the car.  There you go.  Opened up the sunroof and it's not a whole deal.  Wow, nice.  You got an above view.  Some ideas for your, for some other themes.  You know, gratuitous wheat.  Ah, here it goes.  And how about Idle Promise Friday? 
[00:42:30]  Idle Promise Friday.  What's that?  I've been married for 23 years, and that's basically what I get.  Oh, see.  You think you're going to get some and then don't pan out, huh?  That's the story of my life.  Yeah, wait till you get home, honey, and this, that, and the other thing.  And, uh, 12 hours later, uh, nada.  What are you hauling today?  Uh, I haul, uh, aluminum, uh, castings going to the, uh, Magna, uh, driveline plant. 
[00:43:00]  Uh, they're, uh, for transfer cases for GM, uh, 4x4s.  Ah, there you go.  What do you got?  Two of them in there?  That's a little joke on GM's, uh, problems.  Yeah.  All right.  I think that's all we can make out of your phone call there.  Yeah.  But the good news, uh, WoW's alive and well out there on the, uh, highways.  Well, I don't like the way this guy's just waiting around for it when he gets home. 
[00:43:30]  Take some initiative.  Yeah.  Maybe she wants you to come home and take what's yours.  Mm.  Caveman.  Just go in there.  Erg.  Caveman up.  Pick up a frying pan and show her who's boss.  Uh, Iraq, I just want to acknowledge that your, uh, your idea has fallen flat.  What was his idea?  No one's calling in with the prize patrol from their local market or their van driver  name.  What was the bit again, Iraq?  Maybe you could jumpstart it before the break.  Jumpstart.  What was the bit? 
[00:44:00]  Call the time.  Let's call it.  Like a hospital ER.  Right.  What was the bit?  The, uh, call in with the name drivers from their local cheesy stations.  And, uh, who has the stupidest one?  Will we be giving out a prize for this?  We have a prize list.  I'm sure we could.  Yeah, but we don't have any more Alec Baldwin best of SNL. 
[00:44:30]  He gets so nervous and he has to drink when he talks.  Yeah.  Why don't we have prizes?  Yeah.  We're getting away our SNL.  It's because they just spent all our money on a stripper pole.  We can't have strippers in.  This place is bizarre.  Uh, uh, all right.  We'll, uh, we'll regroup.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:45:00]  Got, uh, instant feedback here from someone on their cell phone.  Yeah.  Uh, Tracy is the new PD here in New York City.  And she wants to get, uh, wow stickers out there with the K-Rock logo on them.  Right.  And this guy writes, is Tracy going to make them window clings?  Well, funny you should say that.  We saved Tracy from a complete disaster.  Yes.  We basically told her that the listeners will destroy her. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  She sat us down.  She was very excited.  She said, uh, wow stickers coming back to New York City with the new logo.  Now that we're back to playing, uh, rock.  And then she, uh, kind of showed us like the first window cling.  Yeah, it's like, uh, she said, uh, you know, uh, I'm, I'm going to get, uh, those window  clings because, uh, no one puts bumper stickers on their cars anymore.  And we just laughed.  And we had been through it because we'd been through it before. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, you don't think they'll put them on their cars, do you?  We've been through it with a gentleman named, uh, Roger, Roger, who was a promotions guy  at a station we used to work at here in New York, uh, WNEW.  Uh, we had gone through a very, uh, rigorous and time consuming effort of, of coming up  with a bumper sticker design, something that's visible.  You just see the wow sticker.  You think, wow, but they are very visible on the road.  The colors were considered the font, everything designed by brother Elmo. 
[00:46:30]  Exactly.  Brother Elmo on my space.  And, uh, cute kittens on TV.  And, uh, look, they're meowing.  Yuck.  Oh, they're adorable.  Oh, class action.  Allergic to the little bastards.  Anyway, go ahead.  And, uh, yeah, very, very, a lot of work went into making them look, uh, the way they look.  Well, this guy, Roger, goes, okay, I'm on it.  So he orders them, and it's taking forever, and we're so excited when the boxes of stickers 
[00:47:00]  come in.  So we're like, finally, we are going to be giving these things out.  We're going to go do sticker stops.  We're just going to paste them all over everything, stop signs, uh, here in the city bus booths,  just hand them out to people so they could stick them everywhere, and just canvas the area  in WoW stickers, to make people aware that there are WoW stickers.  He pops open a box, and it's what amounts to a completely different color than we, uh, chose. 
[00:47:30]  It was like, uh.  It's like orange.  Lime yellow.  And lime yellow.  It was the worst.  I mean, yellow sucks as a color to begin with.  And then he found, uh, an even worse version of that.  Yep.  It was horrible.  Right?  Lime yellow is the only way I could explain it.  It was yellow and red.  Yellow and red.  Well, that's not lime yellow.  A yellow and red color form.  Yeah.  All right.  It was like, it was, and he goes, I got you window clings.  And I'm like, what?  What did you do?  We wanted stickers. 
[00:48:00]  We need stickers.  But no one puts stickers on cars.  And this way, they could put it in the back window.  And we go, what about like the truckers, truck drivers that want to put it on the back of  their trucks, or people that just don't want it.  And ass.  Most cars have a bit of a tinge to their windows these days.  Yeah.  Tint.  Everything's tinted.  I mean, why did I say tinge?  A tinge.  Sure.  So you're not going to see it.  And then what about the fact that we want them slapped all over things that aren't cars?  Like when we do appearances at clubs or something like that, we wanted them plastered all over 
[00:48:30]  the neighborhood.  It's called guerrilla marketing.  Right.  To stick them everywhere.  But these are window clings.  And they were so unmanly.  There it is.  Oh, God.  There's a thick one.  It was so unmanly.  Hey, I know Al's listening down the hall.  Now.  And he does like the show rundown for 92.3krock.com.  Yeah.  It's great, by the way, because he adds links to all the stuff we're talking about.  So if we talk about a video, you can just click and see the video we were talking about.  Right.  Right.  Al, if you're listening, if you're going to add this to your show rundown, you've got 
[00:49:00]  to get a picture of the window cling.  E-Rock found one.  It is the worst looking sticker ever compared to the WOW sticker, which, you know, nice  design that your brother did.  The colors really stand out.  We made sure.  And we were like, well, the name of the show has got to be a certain size.  Like we went over everything.  And he goes, window clings with not even a thought of your design to it.  Yeah.  He changed pretty much what he did on his own colors, the font. 
[00:49:30]  He changed everything.  Do you remember sitting there with the ice cream PD that we had?  Yeah.  And they lined up about 15 different designs in front of us.  And we stood there for like a half hour, eliminating some.  All right.  That one's a maybe this one.  I mean, the work.  That's when we used to work at the radio show.  We used to actually like step back, like, all right, let's see.  All right.  You're this far from the car in front of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this one looks good. 
[00:50:00]  That one stands out.  A car length away.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good.  Yeah.  I like that one.  And he picks one.  You can't even read our name on it.  It's so small.  And the WOW is just awful design, awful color.  And it was a color form.  It was a fruit roll up.  It was a shrinky dink.  We'll call it lemon yellow.  Okay.  How about that?  All right.  Lemon yellow.  Bugging Opie, the color.  And a weird red orange.  I would call it another yellow that we can't say here on that.  Well, that's the one.  That's the one.  That's why I was having a tough time.  That's the one.  Because they complain. 
[00:50:30]  That's the one.  Everyone knows it.  You know, when you take too many vitamins, just think that color.  Yeah.  And people say when you see a car of that color, you go, oh, geez, who would drive around  in a car that's yellow?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, that's it.  And he was...  By the way, something to add to this, they would fall off if the sun got your car too hot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They would just roll...  They would roll up into a scroll, into sacred scrolls on your rear deck lid.  You ever, like, touch a centipede on its belly and the whole thing collapses? 
[00:51:00]  It curls up.  That's what these window clings would do.  We should have known we had trouble with him.  I've told this before, but I'll just do it quickly.  This guy, Roger, was a pip.  He didn't get our show at all.  And one day, he decides he's going to come up with a big promotion for us, and he comes  in all excited.  You know, this never gets old, by the way.  And I know the listeners, the faithful ones, have heard this story 10 to 10 times.  It never gets old.  But this just gives you a little line on what Roger was all about.  This is the hell we've been in our entire career. 
[00:51:30]  We finally think we have a PD that we can actually listen to.  This Tracy Broad with the stripper glitter.  Tracy Broad.  And the, you know, the big boobies and the no bra thing that she walks around with every  day.  And, you know, you could also say good ideas.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right, go ahead.  It's on one thing.  Yeah, so Roger decides he's going to come up with a promotion because we wanted to do  a promotion that was going to get our name out there.  It was pretty early in our tenure here in New York and at the new station. 
[00:52:00]  They had brought in this promotion guy who our PD at the time told us was the best promotions  guy ever.  He could get you three Humvees if you need them in a day's notice, he was saying.  By the way, this is the PD that would take three hour lunches.  Three hour lunches.  Come back.  To the point we were going to hire a private eye to see where the hell it goes every day.  What he was doing.  We had some ideas that we probably didn't talk about on the air.  Apparently he was interviewing for producers for our show, but they were all female and 
[00:52:30]  had no radio experience.  Oh my God.  And he spent three hours at lunch with them.  He would drag us to these, God, we're going off on way too many times.  It's okay.  It all comes together in the end.  That's the beauty of us.  He would take us to sushi lunches.  Like we needed a producer.  That was a fact.  Yeah.  And he would take us to lunches with these potential candidates that were just huge booby  monsters and tight sweaters.  And he would just like be at lunch, just staring at the girl's boobs. 
[00:53:00]  Nothing about the show either.  No, nothing.  So what did you do before?  Where'd you go to school?  Right, right.  Just mundane questions.  And look, we're not complaining.  It was nice to like see these booby monsters coming into New York, but there was no way  we were hiring any of them.  They had no radio experience, but broad after broad after broad was flown into New York  for these like sushi lunches.  Yeah.  His lunches to find a producer.  So he gets this promotions guy.  Roger.  Roger. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  And he's like talking him up to us that this guy's great.  So the first thing Roger does is, you know, I'm going to get some publicity for the show.  And we're like, okay, whatever you can do, you know?  So he comes in and with a complete lack of understanding about what we're about, we're  not like a morning zoo show or anything like that, or this hacky radio thing.  He comes in all excited.  And this went down.  Didn't this go down on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Like we wanted him to come in and like announce what this big promotion was.  He goes, guys.  Well, because we heard in the hall and we just, the listeners would just. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Find it very funny like we did.  Guys, I have a promotion for you.  I want you to broadcast from Madison Square Garden.  And I'm thinking.  And we're like, all right.  So far, so good.  Now this has some potential.  That's exposure for Opie and Anthony.  No one knows who we are here in New York.  Broadcasting from Madison Square Garden.  Iconic venue here in New York City.  Probably something big going on there.  Same place that Led Zeppelin played back in the day.  Exactly.  Maybe broadcast from a concert.  From something that's relevant and to our audience. 
[00:54:30]  Guys, I'm going to have a table.  And mind you, right next to the world's largest Pop-Tart.  And you will broadcast beside the giant Pop-Tart.  And we can set up interviews with the chef that cooked the Pop-Tart.  And then people will eat the Pop-Tart and you can talk to them.  So you are broadcasting from Madison Square Garden next to the world's largest Pop-Tart. 
[00:55:00]  And what you just heard was exactly what we said.  Nothing.  We were speechless.  How this guy could come in with that?  A Pop-Tart.  He was then known as Pop-Tart Roger for the rest of his time there.  Never just called him Roger.  It was, hey, Pop-Tart Roger.  How was the broadcast?  That was fantastic.  That was a delicious Pop-Tart.  We said that's Scott and Todd craft. 
[00:55:30]  It was.  How could you make broadcasting next to a Pop-Tart?  That's accurate.  That Scott and Todd do.  Not us.  Hey, we're next to the Pop-Tart.  Coming up next, stick around.  We're going to be talking to the chef of this Pop-Tart.  And then we find out it's even lamer.  It's even lamer than that.  It wasn't one giant Pop-Tart.  They took a bunch of Pop-Tarts and just put them together to make a big Pop-Tart.  They didn't even go through the effort of making the giant Pop-Tart.  Make a Pop-Tart. 
[00:56:00]  This business is so stupid.  So he became Pop-Tart Roger.  And later it was alleged by people that he might have made off with a few of the prizes from the prize closet.  Wow.  And I'm not talking DVDs or CDs.  I'm talking satellite television systems.  Web TV.  Web TV's.  Remember when Web TV was hot?  Remember when the gold records disappeared from the wall?  Wow.  Oh, this guy was a rip.  When we worked at WNEW here in New York, it was like a museum.  The crap that was on the walls, it was like they had like Nirvana stuff signed. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like the whole band lithographs from Zeppelin and like Rolling Stone stuff and Beatles stuff just hanging up on the walls like it was a museum.  What about the tape vault and the recording vault?  And then it became obvious that the place was falling apart.  The wheels were falling off.  And then no one was in charge, really.  And next thing you know, you would come to work every day.  And all of a sudden, the Nirvana thing was missing.  And I'm like, oh, my God, I would have stole that weeks ago if I knew we could take this crap. 
[00:57:00]  Someone stole it first.  Damn you.  Well, I was thinking, you know, I had my eye on that thing.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Of course.  And I was trying to figure out how I could get this legally.  Next thing you know, it was gone.  And then you come in and the Zeppelin stuff's gone.  And then all of a sudden, some rare like John Lennon like cartoon he drew on a napkin was gone that was signed and everything.  All hell broke loose.  Yeah.  There were recordings in this like vault area that people just used to go in and out of and just pilfer from, you know, John Lennon talking to Scott Muni. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, Lennon would come in with a guitar or something, just start fooling around.  And this stuff was like beyond all rare.  Priceless.  Priceless.  What a place.  Next thing you know, like just boxes are being removed.  All right.  Well, anyway, getting back to bring it all around.  Tracy, we saved you a beating.  Yeah.  When you suggested the window clings.  Window clings.  I think it was last week. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  So now we're going with bumper stickers.  Trust me.  Yeah, that's what was going through our heads when we went, no, bumper stickers.  Trust us on this one.  In a split second, that entire story went through our heads.  Trust us on this one.  No window clings.  Yeah.  Don't need the window clings.  All right.  Hey.  You want to become Pop-Tart Tracy.  Don't forget, we got Bret Michaels coming in in about an hour.  Ooh.  Bill Burr coming in at 8 o'clock.  Bill's coming in.  Thanks, certainly.  And we got a phone from Chris Hansen.  And remember, one of our guys.  You know, I don't want to say one of our guys because that's not really true. 
[00:58:30]  A listener of this fine radio show.  Yeah.  He was a Z100 listener who happened to turn on our show at the moment.  Obviously, a Scott and Todd listener.  Well, he was caught in the Catch a Predator house.  Yeah.  And so we got Chris Hansen.  We got Chris Hansen calling in today.  Chris Hansen.  To talk about that.  You were coming here for sex.  And, all right, we got to do one of these because the requests for these are ridiculous. 
[00:59:00]  Really?  You know this.  The smokers laugh, guys.  Well, that laugh has been put to horrific things.  Yeah, those are a couple of news anchors laughing at a runway model falling on her ass.  Yeah.  As she was walking down the runway, they did a little news story on it, and they couldn't stop laughing.  Yeah.  And, I don't know, a few people thought it might be funny to see if that same laugh would 
[00:59:30]  be as funny if it was put to a horrific story.  Yeah.  Well, we can play one of these.  Which one do you want to hear?  Oh, boy.  What are the options?  Well, yeah.  How many are there?  There's three.  You go old school with the Hindenburg disaster.  Oh, okay.  That doesn't hurt anybody.  Yeah.  That tragedy is so old, no one gives a crap.  No one cares.  Like, you know, we figured this out years ago.  Enough time goes by, no one cares anymore.  No, I got Titanic now.  Titanic, no one cares. 
[01:00:00]  Made a little party ride out of it.  So, the Hindenburg, we can play it safe, no one cares, and everyone will just laugh.  Uh-huh.  We could go with the Terry Schiavo thing, which is a bit old at this point.  By the way, my personal favorite.  All right.  Agreed.  Or we could go real fresh and do Tammy Faye cancer audio with the guy laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That one's fine.  Believe me.  That one is really good.  But that Schiavo one is the best. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see Jessica Hahn on TV now that Tammy Faye died, you know, and now she's relevant  again?  No.  They pulled her out of the grave.  No one has talked about her in 10 years, but all of a sudden, she's on all the gossip  shows.  Because she had sex with Jim Faye.  Dude, her face is horrific.  What happened?  All the plastic surgery and the Botox.  Does she got the duck bill nip?  She's crying, but there's like, there's just tears rolling down her face with no, like,  emotion.  Why was she crying?  Because of Botox.  She knew her, right?  Yeah, because, you know.  Because she banged her husband? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I don't know why she's crying.  What's she crying about?  Maybe we could get that audio of Jessica Hahn and try to figure out why she's crying because  Tammy Faye died.  That's a good point, Anthony.  Nothing makes a woman look more like a tranny than those goddamn duck bill collagen lips.  You women are insane for doing that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We can talk about that after the break.  That'll be another 10 minutes.  Yeah, it's a picture of Jimmy Norton, but it's very funny.  Yeah, well.  I've seen that before. 
[01:01:30]  I have not.  We'll go to that after the break, because that's one of the funny people out there.  Yeah, there are.  Yeah, absolutely.  Our listeners are the funniest in all of radio.  We know that now.  I'm going to have to vote for the Shiavo one, because the timing of it was so good.  Yeah.  All right.  It sounded like it belonged together.  It was great.  Right.  All right.  Well, here you go.  Just listen to this.  By the way, our own Danny came up with this, and he's trolling through the new ones.  The listeners are sending in other ones.  So far, none worth playing.  This one's worth replaying. 
[01:02:00]  Terry Shiavo, everybody.  Is the pain constant?  Well, or, or, or, or, is the pain constant?  Here we go.  Not anymore, I guess.  How are you doing?  That had to hurt.  That's embarrassing.  Well, you all are just really tickled by that, aren't you? 
[01:02:30]  Oh, God.  It's the hold on, hold on.  That makes it just, it's perfectly timed. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, is that horrid?  She really was trying to talk, wasn't she?  Was she?  Yeah, man.  They just pulled the plug on her.  They killed her.  Yuck.  Creepy.  All right.  So we, I guess we have to go to break.  Yeah.  When we come back, Dandy, will you bring that picture up?  Yeah, we will.  We'll talk about that next.  Talk about that.  I have to.  Yeah.  Wait, what, that picture?  No, just not after.  I just asked Dandy if. 
[01:03:30]  Do we know who did that picture, Jim?  Okay.  All right, we'll figure it all out next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Lots going on today.  Hey, on the instant feedback, we got Cosimo?  All right.  The DC?  One of the dudes from PowTalk checking out all the wowing that's going on over there today?  Yeah.  Cool.  We should go local for Washington today.  Those newscasters laughing are Washington DC legends George Michaels and Jim Vance. 
[01:04:00]  DC fans will love to know that.  There you go.  Hey, that's cool.  We love those guys.  That's funny.  Who pointed that out?  Was that a listener or did Dandy Walker point that out?  Or what?  I didn't hear you.  No, I wonder if it was a listener or did Dandy Walker point that out.  What?  He said it twice.  It's a question.  Can't talk to my friend?  What?  Wait, I don't get it. 
[01:04:30]  Who?  I'm just talking to my friend.  Who?  Dandy Walker.  Oh, my God.  What?  I don't.  He does a good job over there.  He didn't.  Okay.  Can I go for take two, bringing the show back?  All right.  Banner.  Banner.  Get out of the shot.  All right. 
[01:05:00]  Listening to Dandy Walker.  Yeah, it's E-Rock.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Becko's Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's at the roll.  She's gone.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  The milkman's alive.  Yes.  What are they saying?  What?  What?  Wait.  Oh, no.  You're not mad at me, are you?  I wrote it down in my little stat book as a home run.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Trapway, rebound, score.  Yes.  All right.  No.  What?  Come on.  How does that not go in? 
[01:05:30]  Oh.  Isn't that what you do at home, too?  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, jeez.  That hurt.  Someone's got to pay for that one.  Someone's got to pay.  It was a goal.  Someone's got to pay for that, Jimmy.  Oh, that was when Dandy was spanking that girl.  Dandy.  All right.  He's my friend.  He is my friend.  I love him.  He lost a lot of weight.  Yeah.  He's good. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, it's time for Guess the Sound, everybody.  Our own Pat Duffy came up with this one, and here it is.  What is this?  I know what it is. 
[01:06:30]  It's Pat Duffy with a German Shepherd on his back with oven mitts on.  Wow, that one's really...  Now, can I ask some questions?  Sure.  That clip sounds disturbing.  Yeah.  Is it disturbing?  I ain't answering that.  Why?  Either way.  It could be pleasurable, or it could be disturbing. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that gives away the whole thing.  Fuck you, then.  Hey!  You can't say that.  It's You Can't Say That Wednesday.  It sure is.  I kicked it off with the F-bomb.  Oh, no.  That's no way to get there.  Yes, I did.  What?  Yes, I did.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  No, you didn't. 
[01:07:30]  You can't say that Wednesday.  I did.  You shot her in the...  Can't say that.  If you ever watched a person...  Can't say that.  Oh, how do you say this on regular radio?  Can't say that.  And it was completely acceptable when I was a kid.  But so were some other...  Can't say that.  And I'm thinking, wow, if that was on the radio, we'd be fired.  It's a joking happen show.  Can't say that Wednesday.  Let's say hi to Jason in Cleveland.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, O&A, little Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Just wanted to say hello from Cleveland. 
[01:08:00]  You know, home of the foaming pussy.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You can't say that, man.  You can't say that.  You certainly can.  Jason, you can't say that.  Come on.  Keep it clean.  Keep it clean.  What else is going on in the world today?  Paula Zahn's leaving CNN.  Who gives a crap?  Right.  Where's she going?  Hopefully...  Hopefully to have something removed.  I don't care what it is or why.  Just something has to be removed.  She was obsessed with us when it came to our latest controversy. 
[01:08:30]  She wanted us gone so bad and did a horrendous job reporting on our situation.  So long, Paula Zahn.  She's a dumb broad who's not hot enough anymore to justify her position.  Completely out of touch as far as what was happening with us.  Demanding that we should be fired and all this crap without even looking into the whole thing.  We're going to do some news stories.  Huh?  We're doing news stories.  I just wanted to do the sound thing.  For what? 
[01:09:00]  I bet that I can guess it before the end of the show.  Of course you want to bet.  I just...  Of course you want to bet.  I want to lay down a little wager.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Your betting is getting out of control.  I'm just a little friendly wager.  I'm not taking this bet.  Damn it.  Because the internet spoils it for everyone.  Did it?  Yeah, there's a guy on the line.  He knows.  He knows already?  We're not doing it for you, Joe Internet Surfer. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  Okay.  And yeah, now you know what it is.  So now, no bet.  I can't read the monitor from it.  I know what it is.  I know what it is.  All right, guess the sound.  What is it?  Flintstones clip.  No, not that.  That's it.  But that was the clip.  Yeah.  And does anyone care about Lindsay Lohan back in rehab?  No.  You're stupid.  I'll bet you.  I got a bet.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  Who dies first?  Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, or Britney Spears?  Lindsay.  Lindsay Lohan?  I would say out of those three, could be Britney.  Yeah, Paris, you got to take her out of the mix.  She knows exactly what she's doing.  She invented all this crap, and then the unstable broads have joined her, and that's where the problem is.  Lindsay Lohan or Britney Spears will end up dead. 
[01:10:30]  I see a Britney OD.  Yeah?  Or a Lindsay massive car wreck.  But I think before she – I don't see her getting killed in a car crash, but I see Lindsay killing someone in a car crash.  She's a real wreck.  Britney has kids.  A hazard.  She's a little bit more –  She's not stable, though.  Look what she did to – she did an okay photo shoot, and she was doing some bizarre things.  Like, what was she doing? 
[01:11:00]  Wiped her greasy hands on a $274 designer gown during lunch.  She cleaned her hands up on a designer gown.  And then she let her puppy poop on a $6,700 Zach Posson, I guess, gown.  Took frequent bathroom breaks with the door open.  Oh, nice.  And when I heard that, I'm thinking, well, she's like – she's got to do some stuff in the bathroom, you know, some illegal activities.  But no, I think it was – she was relieving herself and didn't give a crap that the door was open. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, that is disgusting.  Hi, I'm Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's just completely nuts.  And it comes the same day that Lindsay Lohan got arrested on her – arrested for her latest DUI charge.  Lindsay Lohan will end up killing somebody.  Ugh.  They make the worst drunk drivers.  They just plow into things.  What was it?  Lindsay Lohan was chasing her assistant's mother. 
[01:12:00]  Why?  I don't know.  She was drunken and high on the cocaine.  She's exactly where you want her.  Oh, yeah.  She's got, like, a bracelet on her ankle that, what, monitors her alcohol consumption?  She's all hot.  She's got the alcohol monitor ankle.  She's boozing it up anyway, coked up.  She's got a horrid relationship with her father.  It's just a wonderful moulange of getting laid by a hot chick.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  I think anyone would have access to her at this point.  Anyone that says, like, a kind word to her, and you're in.  You know what I don't understand with these Hollywood starlets?  Don't they pay attention?  Like, Tara Reade was Lindsay Lohan.  Oh, my God.  Remember Tara Reade, and everyone's like, wow, she's hot, but she's coking it up, and  she's drinking.  She's a mess.  Out of control.  The paparazzi were taking pictures of her with her boob falling out.  Yeah.  And her falling down.  She was the go-to gal for the paparazzi for a while. 
[01:13:00]  And she was hot, though.  And then all of a sudden, she made that drastic turn, and now she's like, ugh.  Well, the pictures of her bumpy belly came up.  And Britney Spears see this?  Yeah, they don't see it coming.  Like, it's still really hot.  These stories are hot when they come out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But there's going to be a turn somewhere, and that's when they've got to stop before  that happens.  They never see it coming.  You know who are the big competing blondes back in the older days was the blonde from 
[01:13:30]  T.J. Hooker.  Remember her?  What the hell was her name?  How old are you?  T.J. Hooker.  What the?  Yeah.  Heather Locklear.  Oh, Heather Locklear.  There was Heather Locklear, and then that other blonde chick that had the coke habit, and  she wound up just completely...  Who's the other chick?  I'm trying to remember.  Linda Tripp.  No, Heather Thomas.  It was the two Heathers.  Oh, the Heathers.  Heather Locklear and Heather Thomas. 
[01:14:00]  And they were like neck and neck as the hot blondes of the day.  And then Heather Locklear, who still looks good.  Heather Thomas, who knows where the hell she is, but she, even back then, started looking  raggy because she was so into blow.  All right, let's Google Heather Thomas, see if we can get a current picture of her.  What the hell show is she on?  I don't even remember.  Linda Tripp.  Hey, we got someone that wants to guess the sound.  Let's go to George in South Jersey. 
[01:14:30]  George, what's up?  Opie, guys, you guys got a great show, but I think I know what the sound is.  Is it Michael Vick drowning a pit bull?  Wow.  See, that's how the bit goes, Mike.  Look, look.  Mike.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I'm sorry, Mike.  That's how the bit goes, Mike.  That's how the bit goes.  You're right, but no one cares about the right answer.  Don't you get it?  Goodbye, sir.  It's just...  So, uh...  Oh, the fall guy. 
[01:15:00]  That's what Heather Thomas was on.  So, that guy says Michael Vick drowning a pit bull.  Drowning a pit bull.  Drowning a pit bull.  Drowning a pit bull.  Drowning a pit bull.  Best laugh ever. 
[01:15:30]  I could swear I hear a monkey in there  A monkey?  It sounds like a monkey scream  Don't even put that thought in people's heads  Okay  Is it somebody with the rage  from 28 Days Later?  Ooh  Because I think I hear a monkey 
[01:16:00]  Is he eating someone's face or vomiting blood  in somebody's face?  What a great movie  We got Jared in Boston  Jared  What's up?  Not much, I got a guess for you  Is that Terry Schiavo getting plowed by her orderly  And her little snarky poodle is trying to object  but the orderly just looks at it  A threatening look  Alright, we'll play more Guess the Sound in a little bit 
[01:16:30]  I want news stories  because I think  this is my suggestion  Maybe we can have different people read different news stories  Oh, that sounds exciting  I think that would be if I'm a  Fun with a capital F  Alright, like  Get it going  What do you got?  I don't know  You're just going to randomly pick a story?  Let me just rifle through  Alright, rifle through  Randomly picking a story  Okay, this one  Alright, that story  Who do you want to read it? 
[01:17:00]  E Rok  E Rok  Okay  E Rok  Very, very random  E Rok  It's a new bit that Jimmy came up with  It's called  It's called  Have the guy read the story  Just a random guy reading a story  Just sit down and read it  Alright, E Rok  The start of a brand new Jim Norton bit  Nice, Jim  Have the guy read the story  Alright  I see what happens  You just randomly pick a story  and randomly pick a guy  and then you see what happens  What a boop  Very good, Jimmy  Alright, go ahead, E Rok  French doctors are amazed that a 44-year-old civil servant with an abnormally small brain 
[01:17:30]  has led a normal life with a slightly lower-than-normal IQ.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Doctors said the father of two went to the hospital de la Timion in Marcel  with a mild weakness in his left leg.  He was given a CT scan and an MRI, which showed that his cerebral cavities and ventricles had massively expanded. 
[01:18:00]  The brain itself, meaning the gray matter and white matter, was completely crushed against the sides of the skull.  The condition is called Dandy-Walker complex.  Oh!  Look!  Now it's funny!  Hey, Jimmy!  Look at Jimmy!  Oh, let me take all those back.  And the homer's out of here! 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, it is out of here!  They're in their kayaks trying to find the ball!  A, B, C, you later!  Oh, boy!  And that is a goal, absolutely.  We went to the instant replay.  My God.  Wow.  That's the beauty of the show.  It all comes around in the end.  All comes together.  Don't stop reading.  So what is it called?  Dandy-Walker complex.  You are now, from this day forward, Dandy-Walker. 
[01:19:00]  DW for short.  You gotta finish the story.  The condition is called Dandy-Walker complex and is a genetically sporadic disorder that  occurs in one out of every 25,000 live births, mostly in females.  Of course.  Although many with Dandy-Walker develop dramatic symptoms from the condition, such as an enlarged  skull, jerky muscle movements, and problems with the nerves that control the face.  The condition also can develop unnoticed. 
[01:19:30]  Subsequent tests have revealed that the man has an IQ of 75.  That's a nice, solid 75.  And likes to swing on stripper poles.  With a verbal IQ of 84 and performance IQ of 70.  The bulk of people in society have a minimum IQ of 85.  Thank you, Dandy-Walker.  Dandy-Walker.  Hey, by the way, Stephen from Bayshore.  Hi.  He writes, it's huge setup for, it's huge setup for Joke Wednesday. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  Giant setup.  Jimmy knew exactly where he was going.  And we're like, what?  He's cruising just going, look at these suckers.  We're like, what's wrong with you?  Well, I knew there was no way for you to know.  I just, I just liked the idea.  I wasn't sure if anybody read the story.  I should have known.  Yeah.  Nobody read the story.  Read.  Somebody would have read.  I read the story, but I don't, I didn't read the name, I guess.  Steve from Bayshore is also calling him Dandy-Rocker.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland. 
[01:20:30]  Jeremy.  Jeremy.  We're getting really stupid today.  I'm sorry.  All right.  What's up?  Hey, I wanted to play a guest of sound.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is this the audio from the Benoit household?  Oh, all right.  All right.  Here it is.  I'm tapping out.  Tapping out.  Throw in the towel.  Let's say hi to Seth in Maryland.  Seth, what's up?  Good morning, guys. 
[01:21:00]  How are you?  I'd like to play guest of sound.  All right.  Is it Tammy Faye Baker choking on a kidney bean?  What's up?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh, God.  See, that sounded like a monkey. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Then it didn't.  That's not right.  Look, look.  Maybe we should file this.  We're a little vile.  Jimmy, yes.  The picture.  Who came up with this?  Iraq?  Oh, Dandy Walker.  James Dammit on Whack Bag.  And what are we looking at for the people that don't have, you know, video. 
[01:22:00]  Computers in their car.  Yeah, video attached to their radios.  It's very funny.  Your head.  It's the Paul McCartney Starbucks card with Jimmy morphed into it.  Jimmy's making the whole face, though.  You must have taken a picture.  Oh, yeah.  Where you're making the stupid Paul McCartney from his latest album face, where he's pursing  his lips and he's, like, peeking in.  Yeah.  Jimmy, he's peeking in from somewhere.  It looks like he's leaning over, holding his lapels with his women's lips all pursed. 
[01:22:30]  And he's also on the same awful photo shoot, which no one could tell Sir Paul stunk.  He's hiding behind a chair.  This one, like, wild action shot with a chair that's on the cover of the awful trite dribble  album he put out is tipped over.  And he's, like, standing behind it.  Like, there's a conflict.  And he's behind the chair.  Wow.  What happened?  Did she throw the prosthetic at you, Sir Paul, when you didn't want to give her $60 million?  What does the chair represent in that? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  That he's hiding behind it.  I don't know.  And there's something frightening in front of it.  Yoko coming for more royalty money and rights to songs.  Shut up.  I like this song.  Yeah.  Is it growing on you?  Maybe it's George Harrison's wig someone threw at him behind the chair.  Full of pudding.  Full of pudding head.  Do you have that picture online anymore?  Him hiding behind the chair?  Let's find it.  He doesn't even have to pucker his lips when he whistles like that.  He just stands there and blows. 
[01:23:30]  He was breathing.  By the way, someone else tried to guess the sound on Instant Feedback.  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton writes.  That's the sound.  The sound is Tim Donahue.  Is that how you say his name?  Yes.  The NBA ref.  The sound is Tim Donahue covering the spread on when Tammy Faye dies.  That's tough.  That's tough.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah.  Dan was trying to find the... 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I think we gave him some good radio in that 20 minutes.  I don't know.  I feel good about just taking a break right now.  And then we can continue with the Paul McCartney abuse next.  Bill Burr is here as well.  Bill.  And Bret Michaels' Rock of Love is the new show on VH1.  It's basically flavor of love for white people, I guess.  Is that it?  Pretty much, yeah.  He's coming in, Bret Michaels, to talk about that.  And another thing.  Oh, when we get back, remind me.  How to dial a rotary phone.  What?  We get some audio on how to dial a rotary phone. 
[01:24:30]  Where the hell is that from?  It just shows you how far we've come from the early 50s.  Wow.  So, I guess, you know...  Okay.  You used to pick up your phone and then what?  You would tell the operator what you wanted, right?  Yeah.  Back in the day?  Back in the old days.  And then they decided you could dial your own number.  Hello, operator.  Just connect me with a white person.  Where's his music?  He's going with 1940s voice guy.  I like it.  Yes, it's easy to dial the new rotary phone. 
[01:25:00]  That's right.  As easy as using a whites-only water fountain.  In this lovely neighborhood.  You know you won't get connected to a colored person with the new telephone.  They can't afford it.  And it's all their fault.  That's right.  I can't wait to hear it after the break.  Yeah, they have to, you know, tell you how to do it. 
[01:25:30]  Because it was a new technology.  Amazing.  So, we'll do that next.  And some other things.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rock.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about that.  It's Alive and Well on Pow Talk.  Here in New York City, we're getting brand new stickers made for everybody.  In the other cities, they have their stickers for the most part.  Get it on your car, your truck.  There are women out there that will wow you. 
[01:26:00]  Show you a little something-something if they see the wow stickers.  Okay?  Right.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  And we got Bill Burr in studio.  Hello.  And he's very excited because Bret Michaels is coming in in about 20, 25 minutes.  And you're a big fan of Rock and Love?  Oh, great show.  Are you a fan because you think it's a great show or because it's kind of like a train wreck?  Even because of how they started off the show, out of all the humiliating things I've seen on reality television, 
[01:26:30]  they basically get, you know, it's basically Flavor of Love.  So they get 25-  Flavor of Love for white guys.  Right.  For the white audience.  They get 25 white whores this time, right?  They have them out in the driveway.  And, you know, Bret comes up in his yellow motorcycle.  They're all going crazy.  I got a Bret.  Right there, I think, the show is ridiculous that they're going crazy over Bret Michaels.  I mean, back in the day, I understand he was with Pam and everybody else, but come on.  Jesus, come here, dude.  I mean, come on.  If you saw these girls- 
[01:27:00]  Jesus, easy.  That's not reality.  If you saw these girls, though, they all look like the hottest girl at, like, Denny's.  I mean, retired stripper-looking girls.  They're horrific, right?  So he pulls up.  Everybody goes crazy.  And then he walks in the house, and his big bouncer guy stands there, and he's looking  at them, welcoming them all.  And all of a sudden, he just starts calling off names.  Called off, like, he picks one girl, then picks another girl.  By the time he got to the third girl, I'm saying to my girlfriend, going, they're going 
[01:27:30]  to kick these girls out before they even get in the house.  That's exactly what they do.  They pick five of them, and all the other whores are going, like, why are they not picking  me, right?  They get done picking five of these girls, and they're hideous.  They look like, oh, like, they're just awful-looking.  They tell the other girls to go in the house, and then they tell those five girls, basically,  you're too ugly to even get into the house on a horrific reality show. 
[01:28:00]  That's true.  That was awesome.  Did they talk to him?  I'm very disappointed.  Well, there was one girl who just, like, all of them, yeah, they're all just like, I'm  embarrassed.  I came all the way from Iowa.  Like, they're just, like, from horrific states, right?  The bus from Oklahoma City was 72 hours just to get to Utah.  I deserve more, right?  But one girl just refused to leave.  Wow.  She was just the whore that wouldn't quit, right? 
[01:28:30]  So she comes back, you know, and just starts pounding on the door, and then they just had  to let her in, and, I mean, she looked like she was every bit of 47.  Oh, my God.  Is that Tiffany?  That was the girl who kept going, don't threaten me with a good time.  Oh, Tiffany.  We got that clip, actually.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  That was her catchphrase.  They did a montage last night.  I don't know if it was on last night.  I have it on DVR or whatever.  But the episode I saw, they did a montage of her saying that over and over again.  And when she says it is basically when someone's telling her to get her life together, someone's 
[01:29:00]  criticizing her.  Someone's trying to give her some real good advice, and that's what she's saying.  Yeah.  If you don't shape up, we're kicking you out of the house.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  If you don't get off drugs, we're taking away your children.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  She was a mess.  It's the catchphrase of the summer, though.  Oh, it's fantastic.  We got the clip of Tiffany trying to get back in the house after she was deemed too ugly  to be in the house, right?  Big Don, he called out five names. 
[01:29:30]  He told us, you're out of here.  By the way, Bill, thanks for the huge setup.  No problem.  Wow, really?  We just happened to have this clip.  Five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  I didn't come all the way from Chicago to be eliminated before I even walked in the door.  My name is Tiffany.  Hi, Tiffany.  You caught me, and I was wondering why.  Listen, it's nothing personal.  It's physical.  If it was up to Brett, he wouldn't have dismissed me.  No, Brett, if it was up to Brett, the entire city of L.A. would be here.  But I'm a big fan of his.  I had a hat made. 
[01:30:00]  I came here all the way from Chicago.  There's literally nowhere for you to sleep.  I'll sleep on the floor.  Please.  Please, I'm begging you.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I don't care.  If I had a hat made, I'll do anything.  Anything.  Anything.  I'm using your bags.  He finally said yeah, and I jumped up, hugged him, and I didn't let go.  It's meant to be. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, man.  What did you have made?  A hat?  Yeah.  I can't hear.  I had a hat made.  Tara Reid's older sister.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll do anything.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  You have to stop smoking crystal meth first.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  I'll tell you, man.  If she did four more episodes, she could have sold a million of those T-shirts.  Yeah.  It was just, it really was going to, like you said, it was going to be the catchphrase of 
[01:31:00]  the summer.  Oh, my God.  Well, then she gets let back in the house, and this is what she does immediately.  I'm Tiffany.  I'm an alcoholic.  Tiffany, she got completely bombed.  I was just sitting back watching, like, holy ****.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ain't no booty like stuff side booty.  Ain't bitch no band enough to step front of my face.  I got here this long.  I'm not going to, like, go home now.  Brett will keep me around.  Just an old, drunk broad. 
[01:31:30]  Is that what she is?  This is what is not doing justice.  She's like one of those girls who's old, but she's kept herself in shape.  Right.  So from the neck down, she could be 32, but you look at her face.  She's just a lizard.  She's closer to 50.  Oh, it's awful.  Tammy Faye.  Yesterday, you know what?  It's a good show.  I mean, yesterday I was watching.  They had to do phone sex.  Because if Bret Michaels is on the road, did you see that episode yet?  Oh, it was great. 
[01:32:00]  I'm telling you, it's a great show.  You know, Bret's girl's got to, like, you know, help him out if he's on the road and  she's back home.  Yeah, sure.  So they had all these girls, like, dress in their hottest, like, lingerie and lay on  this, like, you know, this, like, heart-shaped type bed and do phone sex and he's in another  room.  And they hooked up something.  Did they hook it up to his?  Yeah, they actually hooked something up to his unit.  Yeah.  To see if he would get aroused.  Yeah.  And if you were terrible at it, they would just flatline.  And the best part was Bret would get halfway through.  If they stunk, he just hung up on them. 
[01:32:30]  Dude, I'm telling you.  They got some great bits on this show.  Oh, that's great.  One girl just started just giving phone sex and everyone else was, like, horrified.  Like, whoa, man, this is just a fun little show we're trying to participate in.  And she's like, I'll suck your beep.  The whole, her whole segment was beeped out.  That was the weird thing.  It's your beep in my beep.  Until you beep.  All the other girls are watching.  So it kind of made it awkward. 
[01:33:00]  But there were some girls that were just so bad at it.  They were just like, I just really want to spend time with you.  Yeah, yeah.  I just, you know, I just think you're interesting.  And it's just like, lady, what is this supposed to do for this guy?  This guy's a rock star.  He's probably had an 18 on one.  18 on one.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God, Brett.  Let me tell you what I'll do.  I will take your entire beep into my beep and then beep and beep until you beep all over my beep. 
[01:33:30]  And if you want to put it beep, feel free.  I don't mind.  I've done it before.  Brett, if me staying in the house takes you putting it beep, I will do that.  I've never done that sober.  But I'll probably do it for you.  And I'll even wash beep because my beep is probably really filthy.  But for you, I'll do anything.  I'll let you go from beep to my beep. 
[01:34:00]  And that's really sick.  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  A lot of girls won't do that.  A lot of girls wouldn't let you put beep.  We need a heart monitor here.  And then put beep.  But I would let you do that.  Right there.  And I will beep until you beep.  And then if you want to put it beep, I'll even do that.  I don't care.  Do you have a dog?  If you have a dog and some peanut butter, I will beep the peanut butter on beep. 
[01:34:30]  And then I'll let the dog beep, and you can watch.  I'll even let the dog beep me.  All over my, on my.  And the dog could, I don't even care.  Even the dog could beep my beep.  Because I don't care.  And that's really dirty.  But for you, I'll do it.  We got one more Tiffany clip worth playing. 
[01:35:00]  You love me, b***h.  Love you, b***h.  She's a sloppy mess.  And it's pretty funny.  B***h.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's not a nice word.  Oh, yeah, it is.  B***h.  That's not a nice word.  You can't go throwing words like that around.  Hey, now, now.  Simmer down now.  Simmer down now.  No, you simmer down.  Simmer down.  I know this one faded.  No, no, no, no.  You totally hate.  We're just having a good time.  Yeah, that needed a setup, obviously. 
[01:35:30]  Tiffany calls one of the two black girls in the house an effing C word.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She was dropping it.  Dropping it like it was not that.  Why would they boot her?  Yeah, right.  Did they boot her yet?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they boot.  Yeah, that's where they're just so stupid with these shows.  You would like the black...  You keep her as long as you possibly can.  You know, they did it with Sanjaya.  Loose cannon.  You keep these people.  It makes it interesting.  It would have been good because the black girl on the show is hilarious.  She wore like a...  There's a clip on CW11.  Oh, there it is.  Of a clip of the show. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, well, I think he's on CW11 right now.  And then he's heading over here.  Yeah, there he is.  It's still 1980.  1980, dude.  I was going to say, don't talk about him, but he's on there, so he can't listen to us right now.  He looks good, though, man.  I got to say, he doesn't look much different than he did a few years ago.  Oh, wow.  I mean, they showed him in pajamas without all that stuff, like the headbats.  Oh, that was bad.  Oh, my God.  He looked like a circus clown out of his makeup.  Oh.  It was bad, dude. 
[01:36:30]  He's had some stuff done on his face.  Wow, there's chicks pushing each other and stuff.  No, that black girl's hilarious.  The other black girl there is like, she's really into animals, like PETA, and the black  girl had a fur coat.  And she goes, I hate animals.  She goes, they're for food and clothing.  And she goes, how can you say that?  She goes, if there was an animal in here right now, I'd slit its throat.  I swear to God, just to piss her off, and she totally took the bait.  It was great.  On last night's episode, two girls went at it after the phone sex thing, and they're 
[01:37:00]  upstairs, and the one girl has like, I think the girl calls them circus boobs.  Yeah.  She's got implants that are so massive, and they're really high up, like way higher than  they're supposed to be.  That's bizarre.  They're massive, and she calls them circus boobs.  They are a little freakish.  She looks like she has an ass on her chest.  So the one girl thought she was going to be cocky and started making fun of her circus  boobs.  So the circus boob girl goes, oh yeah, and just starts making fun of her face.  And it turns out the girl that has the kind of the face is a little off is because she 
[01:37:30]  was in a car accident in 50 stitches.  Oh, Jesus.  So, you know, she started the little fight, and then circus boob goes, well, look at your  awful face.  And she's like, but that was from a car accident.  Like, you went too far with this.  And she started complaining to Brett saying it was, it's, it's like a disability.  Would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair?  Right.  But she was the one.  You know how it goes.  If you're going to fight, you're going to, you know, you're going to break out all the, 
[01:38:00]  all the weapons.  Wow.  That's not fair.  I was in a car wreck.  Yeah.  If your face went through a windshield, you probably shouldn't start snapping on somebody.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be talking about someone's circus boobs.  They just showed a motorcycle accident, a little motocross, a little crash one of the  girls took, face planted.  It was pretty good.  So they just put these whores in interesting little contests and competitions.  Dude, they're all whores.  They're all trying to act like they're not whores.  But they have a stripper pole in there. 
[01:38:30]  And then the second they got drunk, all of them were doing those, those, you need whore  abs stripper moves on the pole.  You know, you got like your legs straight out.  It's like the only people who can do that are strippers.  Yeah.  I didn't want to like the show, but I like it.  Yeah.  That VH1 knows what they're doing with this celebrity reality crap.  I was telling Jim last night at the cellar, like we were talking about, you know, how,  you know, the reality TV and game shows, there has never been a better time in Hollywood  to be a has-been than it is right now.  Oh my God, you're right. 
[01:39:00]  You have a better shot at getting a TV show than I think.  Than anyone else.  Somebody brand new, yeah.  Scott Baio, I just want to punch him in the face.  Have you seen that show?  The Two Corys.  The Two Corys.  They were in here yesterday.  The Two Corys, yeah.  But my thing is, what is the cutoff line where even like you're too old?  I think it's like 75 or four.  I would say like Tony Dow isn't getting a reality show.  He was the older brother on Leave It to Beaver.  But then when you get to that old, then you have to herd the has-beens.  You got to put them all in a house. 
[01:39:30]  In a surreal house, yeah.  After 1970.  Like the My Three Sons guys.  The My Three Sons sons.  You could get one of them.  Yeah.  And he just sat there crying how there was no residuals.  Anyone from Gilligan's Island, do you think?  It'd have to be one of the women.  Yeah, Marianne or Ginger.  Ginger, yeah.  Yeah, they could probably do it.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to like change gears a little bit here.  How to dial a rotary phone.  We teased this before the break. 
[01:40:00]  Ah, speaking of the olden days.  Nice segue.  Well, you know.  Speaking of Juan Epstein, sometimes you got to just jam on the brakes.  Well, they could do that.  The Welcome Back Cotter people would definitely be.  Yeah.  Because they had Horshack in the fights.  Remember that?  And that celebrity box.  They've just been through all these and they gather up the has-beens to beat each other up.  And Horshack got beat up by Screech, right?  Yeah.  I'd love to be a has-beens agent just to hear the offers that come in. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, it's got to be just hysterical.  VH1 wants you for a celebrity toe jam.  Race to the bottom of the Grand Canyon with the cast from Family Affair.  Just these horrific shows.  It's heading that way.  They're going to get worse and worse.  Yeah.  It is VH1, I think, that started all that stuff, too.  They're the ones we first came up with.  Yeah, yeah.  They're brilliant, man.  Well, they came up with the concept of celebrity reality.  Yeah, they took the reality show thing.  The celebrities involved with the reality shows. 
[01:41:00]  Making it cool.  Because when reality shows first hit, no celebrity would be caught dead to it.  It's like, oh, that's hack stuff.  Those are people that just can't make it legitimately.  Yeah.  But then somehow VH1 talked them into it.  Well, they don't get the big celebrities.  They get the has-beens, which is hysterical.  Well, watching these people living together.  Yeah, but see where it's going, though?  It's going to be legitimate stars are going to sign on for this as their next project.  You watch.  You think?  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  That mini-me guy, he was the quickest has-been ever.  He was just like the, you know.  Yeah.  They were still in post-production.  Yeah.  He was.  Yeah.  And he was naked on that little scooter, peeing in the corner.  Yeah.  One of the greatest moments ever, by the way.  And he was huge, like when the movies came out, the Austin Powers movies, like people were  quoting things from the movies.  I remember, like, page six, he was in scores and he had little leather pants.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  And he was the toast of the town from Monday to Wednesday.  And then he's, ah.  Oh, my God.  How do you make a comeback from that?  How can you classify that as a person?  No.  What about when he started going, ah.  Yeah, do we have that clip?  Do we have all the clips? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  If you're laying there dreaming about a fire, you think there's a fire engine?  Yeah.  What a mess.  And he was.  He was, you know, a big star.  Even when he's sleeping, he doesn't even look peaceful.  No.  Completely naked on a scooter, gets off and just takes a leak in a closet.  And then he was in all the Austin Powers movies.  That's great.  So how to dial a rotary phone?  Ah, right.  Well, everyone around here has got their iPhone. 
[01:43:00]  Some people love them.  Some people hate them.  I am a fan of the iPhone.  The jury's still out.  Jimmy, not a fan.  I don't hate it.  What I hate is AT&T.  I love the technology of the iPhone.  I just don't like AT&T.  American Telephone and Telegraph.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  It's Ma Bell.  Oh, cool.  You don't like it?  I haven't had any trouble.  Thank goodness.  iPhone sales were disappointing, by the way.  Stock dropped, what, $8 yesterday?  What it is, it's AT&T. 
[01:43:30]  And I heard they almost had a deal with Verizon.  Yeah.  Because Apple is notoriously, I mean, they put out great stuff, but they're hard to deal  with.  I mean, and they wanted a piece of every phone call made.  At first, they only wanted stuff sold in Apple.  And AT&T's like, well, you got to get, we have to all sell the phones in our stores.  And then they want, like, 50 cents or whatever for the first minute for every phone call made  on the iPhone.  Some kind of weird concession they want.  Phone companies never give up.  And Verizon, I think, from what I heard, that was the breaking point.  Verizon, I'm like, no.  No.  And they had the best coverage by far, Verizon, because they have landlines. 
[01:44:00]  Dude, I talked to Bob Kelly.  His phone, it cuts out all the time.  He's the worst.  He's got a $500 phone, and I got to go, Bob, go walk back to where you were.  And I got one of those little chick phones that you flip open.  Yeah.  Verizon, it's way better.  I haven't had any trouble.  I'm knocking wood, but I haven't had trouble with Signal.  I love it.  I love the, look how futuristic.  I had nine or ten texts in a row.  No, you'll throw it.  I know you're comedians.  Dude, I had nine or ten texts in a row yesterday that said, error, sending message. 
[01:44:30]  Error, cannot send.  It would not send the text.  I had to move around the house and hold my phone towards the window.  Did you sit out all night with, like, a tent to get it?  Dude, it's like holding a ray gun.  I got to point it a certain way.  See, that's cool.  It's futuristic.  This is a $600 phone, which I do like.  The technology, like, you scroll your fingers, you open it up.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  But the fact that Steve Jobs makes things so difficult and they had to go with AT&T, it's 
[01:45:00]  like, come on, guys, what are you doing?  Yeah.  I don't like that exclusive phone company crap with telephones.  Yes.  You know, they make these deals.  You should be able to pick whatever service you want with whatever phone you want.  Whatever phone or whatever.  Yeah, because sometimes there's a really good phone and lousy service.  Right.  Bastards.  Well, we've come a long way, though.  We certainly have.  There's the SEG.  So you got the iPhone.  Mm-hmm.  A mere 50 years ago, they had to teach people how to use a rotary phone.  Rotary phone.  Because, you know, back in the day, you picked up the phone, you talked to the operator.  Right.  And then they did away with that, and now you can dial your own numbers. 
[01:45:30]  You have to crank that little crank on the side.  Operator.  And then go, Sarah?  Yeah.  Sarah, could you connect me to 555?  Right.  Well, here's the, here's.  Murray Hill 6.  Yeah.  Wisconsin 9 or 8.  Here they instruct you on how to use your rotary phone.  The local news of the week.  At midnight Saturday, the telephones in this city will be changed to dial service, and all  telephone numbers will be changed.  Ah.  Late this week, new directories will be delivered. 
[01:46:00]  This is important.  Here are a few important suggestions for the use of your dial telephone.  Before calling any number, first secure the number from your new directory.  Then remove the receiver and listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  Oh my God.  Are you kidding me?  Doesn't everything just sound harrowing?  Like the Russians are going to attack at any moment?  Oh my goodness.  And why can't we, like, update that?  Why are we still using that?  Nah.  We still got it.  It's a little different variation, but it's there. 
[01:46:30]  But can't it be something else by this point?  I didn't understand even what he was saying.  Secure the number?  Secure the number.  Does that mean look it up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First secure the number.  Memorize it, or stay away from the apparatus.  You do not have the brain intellect to use this new technology.  Let's get the voice down.  That's it.  It sounds like this.  If you hear it, run.  That's right.  Your phone's about to explode.  The Reds have gotten your phone.  The Reds.  The Reds are coming. 
[01:47:00]  The Reds.  Do not discuss the war when you pick up the apparatus.  Loose lips, sink ship.  Oh, sorry, man.  Loose lips, sink ship was my line.  Damn you, Bill Burr.  If I'd have secured the number earlier, it would have been my line.  And listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  That tone indicates everything is ready for your call. 
[01:47:30]  With the receiver off the hook, dial the desired number.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around to the finger stop.  That's a whole phone number back then.  That's a whole number?  No dash, no parentheses, no nothing.  If you want to dial 5, it's like, what's your number?  5.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around to the finger stop each time. 
[01:48:00]  Be sure to allow the dial to freely return to its normal position.  Oh, would you try to stop it with your finger?  You push it sometimes.  Oh, I remember dial phone.  Come on.  You'd go like, and then rake it back to its starting position.  Oh, that's right, you would.  Because you'd try to dial faster.  Wow, I forgot all about the stupid dial phones.  The dial to freely return to its normal position.  And this is the ringing signal. 
[01:48:30]  What's the same, too?  Hello?  What's the problem?  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  Come on.  Alexander Graham Bell joke?  No?  No, that's good.  I just did it.  Yeah.  If the line is here, you'll hear.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Well, how do you walk?  You could call your local bowling alley.  Call a tobacco shop.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can? 
[01:49:00]  Well, you best let him out.  He may suffocate.  There can't be much air in there.  In there?  Hello?  Is your refrigerator running?  Well, you better catch it.  Your food will go bad.  Listen to me.  You gotta go turkey.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get Brett Weir, I said.  It's the super across the way. 
[01:49:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Butt plug?  Hello?  Are we still allowed to...  Probably not.  We're not allowed to play butt plug anymore?  Of course not.  No?  That can't...  You can't even say it.  Oh, wow.  We've probably been dumped out of twice.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Well, you can't say that.  No.  It is, uh, you can't say that Wednesday. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, true.  It's going to pick up.  If the line is busy, you'll hear this busy signal.  It's just everything is so terminal back then.  Yeah.  Huh?  It really is.  Like, meh.  Ah.  Yeah, but we haven't really updated that crap.  The busy signal.  If you hear this busy signal, go to your local shelter.  Where there will be food and supplies.  You may have to stay there for weeks as the radiation settles down. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, wait.  It's just a busy signal.  Sorry, I thought the commies were coming.  The Reds.  The Reds.  Just when we got done with the Nazi menace, the Reds come.  And remember, if you see black people in your neighborhood, dial 9-1-1.  No, it's back in the day.  Dial 9-1.  If you're a Negro.  No.  Dial 9-1.  9-1.  Just 9.  Yeah.  That's reserved for the police.  They'll be sure to be there with fire hoses and German shepherds. 
[01:51:00]  It's the 50s.  Get it?  If you get a busy signal, try writing a letter.  Thought it was funny, Than.  Thank you.  Good time to credit Than.  Yeah, right?  It was funny.  Until Saturday midnight, please use your present directory and make your calls in the usual manner.  How was that? 
[01:51:30]  Yelling out the window?  Well, you just pick up and the operator did it all.  Operator.  Number, please.  Someone has called me out on my stock info.  Didn't we read Apple dropped eight bucks yesterday?  Seven dollars.  They lost seven billion in the market.  Didn't we?  It was six percent it dropped, but they're still up to like a hundred and...  Alex is saying it's been steady at 135 for about two weeks already.  Tell Alex to shut his face.  Dude, they dropped six percent yesterday.  Right?  The market dumped like a couple hundred points yesterday. 
[01:52:00]  Yes, he probably just didn't get the information on his phone.  What are you...  This is going to be boring for most people, but let's find out now.  Let's see what...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a second.  He's a douche.  This is how you turn it on.  The Apple iPhone is giving investors something to talk about, and it's not all good.  This is how you turn it on.  TNT Wireless, the exclusive wireless service provider in the U.S., the initial debut of  the device was nowhere as strong as analysts first predicted.  Only 146,000 iPhone subscribers signed on in the first two days of the Pulse Connect debut, 
[01:52:30]  a far call from the 500,000-plus number first put out by analysts.  Some of the disappointment is being blamed on the iPhone activation process, which was  entirely Internet-based.  A small number of the first buyers couldn't activate their phones until three or four days  after purchase.  He's figuring it out.  But analysts say the first few days of subscriber sign-ups may not tell the whole picture of  the launch's success. 
[01:53:00]  For its part, AT&T says demand for the iPhone remains strong since then.  More clarity on the debut is expected when Apple releases its quarterly results on Wednesday.  Can that be any more boring?  What channel is that from?  Keep, keep, keep, keep, keep.  Was that from the BBC or something?  NPR?  What was that?  That was just dull.  According to our own fan, it fell $8.81 to $134.89.  Why does it make me happy?  Because you're sick of the hype and the tech, the everybody's screaming about how great 
[01:53:30]  it's going to be and you know it's going to be irritating and dummies like me and him  and him run out and get it.  Dummies?  I enjoy it.  But you're not one of the...  I'm waiting for a couple of upgrades maybe.  I'd like a video.  It's more Bobby.  Bobby flaunts his technology.  Yeah, he's fine.  Like a little whore.  Oh, yeah.  Bobby's, uh...  So does Vaz, but his technology's from like 1997.  Did you see this?  It's a dial phone.  Do we know if Bobby had a baby yet?  His friend's having a baby.  Yeah, what happened?  Well, let's find out next because we're real late.  And hopefully Bret Michaels will make it before we end this side of the show. 
[01:54:00]  He's on his way from WB11.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Bill Burr, what are you promoting?  Anything, Bill?  Absolutely nothing.  I was just a fan of Bret Michaels.  Great.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  All right.  More with us.  Opie and Anthony, next.  Opie and Anthony with you.  Boy, big thank you to all the women on Pal Talk wowing today.  Yeah.  Helps us through the show. 
[01:54:30]  Growl.  We're having fun today.  Fun today.  Bill Burr in studio.  Still chewing an egg white omelet here.  Yeah, he's running late because he just got off TV.  Yeah, that's quite true.  He should be here any minute.  What the hell is that coming to the Opie and Anthony show?  Travis was showing us some of the potential people that are coming in with their oddities.  I saw one and wow.  Where's Travis?  We got an update on this?  The grand prize, by the way, is an iPhone, man.  How cool is that?  An Apple iPhone.  How cool is that? 
[01:55:00]  Everyone's loving them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Everyone's digging them, man.  My cousin's still standing in line for one, man.  Is he still in line?  Unbelievable.  Yeah, grand prize, an iPhone.  Second prize, $250.  Third prize, $100.  And you also get diagnosed by some professionals.  But our professionals are also going to tell you to go see your regular doctor.  We're just trying to do this to kind of like...  Diagnosed for what?  Brain cancer from using the new...  Anything.  Dude.  Dude.  From using cell phones. 
[01:55:30]  What the hell is that?  Basically, if there's something on your body and you're pretty sure it's not supposed to be there,  we want to see it.  Oh, Christ.  We got medical professionals that'll examine your oddity and then point and laugh at you.  Yes.  First of all, you didn't have to circle...  Oh, my God.  Is this guy coming in?  You didn't have to circle the oddity on this guy.  Is this guy coming in?  Would you look at that picture and go, what's wrong with this dude?  Unless you circle it?  Oh, wow.  All right.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  Wow.  If you got an oddity, we want you to email Travis.  And obviously, people are emailing Travis and sending the pictures of the oddity in. 
[01:56:00]  It's Travis at FoundryMusic.com.  That's F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  FoundryMusic.com.  Travis at FoundryMusic.com.  And we're doing it a week from tomorrow, I do believe.  What are we looking at?  We're looking at somebody with a nose that's made out of Play-Doh.  And somebody pinched one of his nostrils.  Wow, that's something.  How do you describe that?  He has a pinky sticking out of the left side of his nose.  Pinky toe.  Yeah, it's just his face constantly. 
[01:56:30]  It basically looks like, yeah, I'm onto it.  Okay, you take your pinky and you go to pick your nose.  And then someone chops off the pinky right at the second knuckle down.  And just leaves the pinky there.  And rips out the pinky nail.  And then the other part of the pinky decides to start growing back into your face.  It may sound like something's wrong with his hands.  Huh?  You made it sound like something's wrong with his hands.  No, this is the pinky picking the nose.  And then the pinky stays there for the most part. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, can we put these pictures up on the website for the...  All right.  His nose is kind of smeared across his cheek.  And this guy doesn't know what this is?  This little piggy.  Yeah, this little piggy.  He's got an extra piggy on his nostril.  It looks like a little toe.  It's definitely a little toe growing out of the side of his nose by his nostril.  Okay.  Well, he's in.  Acid trip face.  Yeah.  And then we have...  Funhouse mirror face.  Then we have this guy.  Where Travis had a... 
[01:57:30]  Travis had a circle of the oddity here.  It's Jason.  What did you think we were going to think it was, Travis?  The shirt?  Yeah.  Well, the shirt's an oddity, yes.  The guy, first of all...  Unless you live in Seattle in the year 1991.  He's got a shaved head, which is probably very difficult to do when you have what looks  to be...  I don't even know what that is.  Some type of bump growing out of the top of your head.  What was that Star Trek movie where they put those worms in the helmets and it crawled 
[01:58:00]  in the person's ear?  Oh, Captain, they put creatures in our bodies.  Yeah.  Oh, well, I can't help you there.  That's what's on top of his head.  Where'd they put him?  He never says in his ear.  In our ears.  In your ears?  In our ears.  I saw him bomb up in Montreal this weekend.  Who, Shanner?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  He was hosting the gala and it wasn't his fault.  They gave him this sketch to do about Harry Potter and he was mocking how big the book 
[01:58:30]  was and he was supposed to open up this thing that the book was in and there was supposed  to be an explosion with smoke and nothing was happening.  Oof.  Oof.  Yeah, it was great.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Did he address it?  Yeah.  He covered it the best he could and I was standing.  It was one of those stupid, you had to walk down 58 stairs to walk up to the microphone  because it's television.  Yeah.  Rather than just having you step out behind a curtain, they had you walk down these Miss  America like you just won the crown. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  Because it's television.  Yeah.  Why is that?  You kind of walked down 800 steps.  Dude, it was one of those moments I was sitting there backstage.  First of all, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do that just doesn't like just  have the F word 58 times in the joke and I'm listening to Shatner bombing and then I  have to walk down like 58 stairs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  You got some life going on there, Mr. Barr.  No kidding.  Getting back to what the hell is that.  We got a webpage to give out.  If you want to see this nose oddity where it looks like the pinkies are still attached 
[01:59:30]  to the nostril and part of it's like kind of cheek, the page is thebestpageintheuniverse.net.  The bestpageintheuniverse.net to see this oddity.  And this guy is definitely coming in.  Where is he from?  Is that him?  It's his page?  Or is it just...  I don't know.  Because it could be just people sending in like pictures.  You mean this might not be a contestant?  Oh.  Have you talked to him, Travis?  No, I have not.  Then it's not him. 
[02:00:00]  What about the guy with the bump on his head?  Yeah, I've got his phone number.  Oh, you're talking to him.  So he's coming in.  What about bunion nose?  No, we don't...  No bunion nose?  It's just somebody sent one in.  No firecracker face?  You know?  Shove the cherry bomb up his nose and lit it.  All right.  Well, we're hoping this contest is going to be...  He's the urban myth guy.  I'm hoping this contest is going to be something, but I'm thinking it's going to be a buck.  Look, here's a...  If you got an oddity, you got to email Travis immediately. 
[02:00:30]  It's simple.  Last time we did this, we had all sorts of crazy stuff to look at.  You got anything.  Something growing on you.  You don't know what it is.  Something you want a doctor to maybe look at, but you don't want to go to the doctor.  Or just some odd thing that you've had your whole life.  Come on in.  You have the chance to win the iPhone.  And don't we have cash prizes?  Oh, yeah, we do.  Yes.  You know what you should do?  You should direct the signal at the growth from the cell phone to see if it's some sort  of poor man's chemo.  Give it a try. 
[02:01:00]  Could you see that if the iPhone cures cancer?  And then he'd be going, ha ha, see?  Well...  And the stock still goes down.  What do we got to do?  Jesus Christ.  Well, now that page...  The latest disease-curing jerk.  Now the page I just gave out, that page is for the iPhone.  So, we've, you know...  Oh.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I don't either.  All right.  So, the nose guy's not coming in, obviously.  All right.  Listen, let's move on.  Screw this.  Travis at foundrymusic.com if you want in on the What the Hell is That contest. 
[02:01:30]  Do you have any nutty pictures you want to send in?  Yeah, don't send the pictures in.  We really want legitimate contestants for this.  All right.  Yeah, we need people to come down.  I really thought...  I'm so disappointed.  I thought nose guy was, you know, definitely happening.  I wanted to bite it.  I wanted to bite the thing off his face.  His nibble.  I would have sunk...  I would have sunk my teeth into it.  I would have pushed his nose and sunk my wallers into it.  And ripped it off his face.  We're going to have a problem with sales after the radio show today. 
[02:02:00]  Ooh.  Why?  Fezzy, we love you.  Hello, boys.  Hi, Fez.  Uh, Fez was told to, uh, call to promote an appearance he's doing with, uh, our own E-Rock.  Yes.  But, uh, sales never kind of, never told us about this.  Oh.  That's wonderful.  You know, first of all, I want to see nose guy really bad, but how will we recognize him  when he gets there?  He'll be the one, everybody's going, yuck, when he walks by. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, he'll be the only one who's not tearing in his eyes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, Fez, you do realize that you are, are you and Ron both going, or is it just you?  Uh, it'll be the Ron and Fez show.  Here's the thing.  It's VIP club, an adult entertainment club.  Yeah.  And as buxom as E-Rock is, and as perfect as he is to host this gig, it really does need  a hostile takeover by the Ron and Fez show.  You do realize that you guys were only brought on board because no one would go to see Eric.  Yeah.  Especially, uh, nude. 
[02:03:00]  They are using you to fill up the VIP gentleman's club.  Well, you know, it's exotic dances and stuff, and who knows more about the poon than Fez  Wiley boys?  Well, yeah.  You know, I love the ladies.  Well, um.  Do ya?  Do ya really?  Fez, you really?  Fez, have you ever gotten a lap dance?  Um, yes, actually. 
[02:03:30]  From a girl?  Yeah, and threw up immediately afterwards.  Oh, must have been something you ate.  It really was.  I think like a flu was coming on or something.  Yeah.  So, Ron and Fez with E-Rock, our own E-Rock, this Friday night at VIP Gentleman's Club from  10 to midnight, and VIP is located at 20 West 20th Street.  That's very easy.  Yeah.  Here in New York City.  Oh, I may go see you there.  It's Friday night, 10 o'clock.  E-Rock, you're going to be taken to the pole over there like you did this morning on our  show?  Yeah, that was impressive, E-Rock.  Maybe take your shirt off, your pants, and do a little spin on the pole? 
[02:04:00]  Might need a few lessons before that.  Hey, Fezzy.  Good improv.  You may need a pair of princesses for pasties.  Yeah, pasties.  Hey, Fezzy.  Fezzy.  We got a stripper pole in studio.  We got a stripper pole in studio, our P.D.  Tracy.  Really?  I thought that was Travis.  She gave us a stripper pole.  We tried it out with E-Rock this morning.  But I'm thinking that you might have to come by tomorrow and do a little spin or two on  the stripper pole to promote your big appearance at VIP Gentleman's Club with Ron. 
[02:04:30]  Andy Walker.  And E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  Sure.  Anything.  So you just surprise us tomorrow with some kind of outfit.  You do a couple spins on the pole, and then we promote the big gig for you guys.  Sounds good.  You know me.  I've been known to go around the pole or two.  Yeah, well.  He's a fake.  Hey, we don't know that.  Tony Soprano.  We don't know that.  Yeah, I'm not the one who showed up to see Bret Michaels. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, hey.  Hey.  All right.  You got something going on.  Looks like we're all going to be disappointed, too.  Is he showing?  He'll show.  He was supposed to be on this side, though.  He might be on the other side.  He might be on the other side.  It happens.  What can I tell you?  All right, Fezzy.  There you go.  Big appearance for you guys this Friday.  All right.  Hot style takeover of the VIP Club this Friday.  Let the rumors begin, by the way, because what are you doing calling us over here? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, well, I just thought this was the appropriate place.  Huh.  Interesting.  Let the rumors begin, boys.  And the rumor is out of the gate.  And it takes an early lead.  There it is.  Run with it.  Why would this station have Ron and Fez, who don't even work for this station, doing an appearance on a strip club?  That would be ridiculous.  I was thinking the same thing.  What the hell is going on?  He couldn't wait a few more minutes, and then it would just be for the satellite side. 
[02:06:00]  I don't understand it, quite frankly.  Where they work alongside us.  Sometimes there's confusion and people mess up.  Maybe that's what it is.  Yeah, I think that was a mistake.  You called a little too early or something, maybe.  It's my rotary phone.  Oh, no.  Now we got music.  What's going on?  What's going on with this?  Wow, that's a mixture of...  Why the hell would we play this music out of nowhere?  This is Ron and Fez music.  Huh.  It's interesting. 
[02:06:30]  All right, Fezzy, tomorrow, outfit, you're spinning around the pole.  And by the way, for the faithful listeners, eventually we'll have hot chicks doing the same thing.  Sure.  We certainly will.  All right, Fezzy.  All right, boys.  See you tomorrow.  Later, Fez.  And leave Eastside Dave home.  Oh, my man beats will be there Friday at the VIP club.  But I mean, leave him home as far as coming on our show tomorrow.  He just wants your love, Opie.  Duty Wars is over.  It's over.  It's over.  Over, I say.  It's over, Johnny. 
[02:07:00]  Now it's over.  Now it's over until there's more duty.  Duty Wars.  All right, Fez.  All right, boys.  Say hi to Ron for us.  Will do.  All right.  Can I say this tomorrow night?  I don't have the info in front of me, of course, but I'll be doing a signing at the Barnes & Noble  in Long Island.  You are Barnes & Noble, Old Country Road in Carl Place.  Jimmy.  7.30 p.m.  7.30.  I'm going to come down and say hi to Jimmy during his book signing because it's close to me.  And we're off the next day. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  You could come over my house.  I will.  We could play.  Watch me never leave.  I'll be like the guy who just doesn't get the hint.  Kind of like on this show.  Well.  Opie politely invited me once in 2000 and all of a sudden you had to hire me because you  were too nice to go get the F out.  Gilbert, anything?  What's happening?  Pittsburgh Improv, August 12th.  Oh, there you go.  You should promote that.  We're on in Pittsburgh.  All right.  Yeah, I'll be out there.  I don't know if they're listening, but we're on it. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  We're on a station down there or over there.  Rumor has it.  Kind of over west, sort of like southwest.  I'd say over there.  Over there.  Let's just say over there.  Bill Burr is coming to Pittsburgh, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  We're out of here.  Goodbye, gang.  We'll see you tomorrow.  No, Brett Michaels.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't he show up?  What happened?  I don't know.  Have a good day.  Where is he?  I don't know.  Sounds like me or the good time.  I'm scared.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:08:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  We're on the XM.  We got Bill Burr in studio.  He came in because he's a big fan of Rock of Love, right?  With Brett Michaels.  I was actually, you know, I was talking to Danny on the internet and emailing him. 
[02:09:00]  Like a future guy.  Oh, yeah.  No, we had little video cameras.  He was taking his hat off.  What year is this?  The year 3000?  Wow.  You guys are amazing.  There he is.  Yeah.  I was just saying I was watching the show, man.  What's up, man?  Hey, Brett Michaels.  How's Brett?  How you doing, man?  Good.  Good.  What's up, Brett?  How are you, man?  All right.  Let me get over here and just say hello.  What's up, man?  How are you, man?  Bill Burr.  Hey, Brett, I got to tell you.  When I saw like the promos for Rock of Love, I'm like, I don't know. 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  And then I saw it.  I'm completely hooked.  Are you hooked?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I saw the promo, I was like, I don't know.  Right.  I was thinking the same thing.  Because, you know.  These are no.  Does it matter?  You guys don't care.  No, you don't need to have your own things.  No, don't worry about it.  No, because I was thinking Flavor of Love.  Right.  And I'm like, how do you do the Flavor of Love show again?  Right.  Right.  Because that was huge for everybody.  And it's kind of sort of like a white version of that.  But you're doing your own thing with this show.  Yeah.  I think the show, you know, it's a weird thing because I've never, you know, in all my years 
[02:10:00]  of partying and bizarre things and being on the road, I have never,  I've never done anything this weird because when they say they're filming you 24-7, you're  thinking, well, you know, I can get up in the morning.  I'm diabetic, right?  I just had a moment coming over here.  I'm having a low blood sugar.  I'm like, I need to fix this in the traffic because of the big burst.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The crater on the street.  Yeah.  Asbestos is fine.  I'm going.  Got to love New York, right?  Yeah.  My dad is like.  Wouldn't be New York if we didn't have this stuff going on.  But we, when I went in to do this, I got to be honest, I thought, man, 24-7, I'm pretty 
[02:10:30]  sure it's, you know, it's not going to be like that.  But they literally, besides going to the bathroom, film everything you do.  And I'm a pretty independent guy.  I'm not a big posse guy.  You know, there's not like 80 agents don't tell me where to go.  And, you know, I just do my thing.  And I got to be honest with you.  It was the first day I pulled in there, they picked me up.  VH1 is pretty open about shooting stuff.  It's not.  I know you guys were having a debate the other day with, I want to say the Corys, about whether  it's scripted or not.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, no, no, no.  Let me. 
[02:11:00]  This is what's screwing up reality TV.  We'll say it again.  And I don't think it's really going on with your show.  They've decided that they need to script reality shows.  Right.  And they did it with the Hogan family.  And that's why I don't watch the Hogan family.  Scott Baio shows.  That's why I stopped watching it.  Because you could tell.  And then the two Corys, I wanted to like the show.  And I told them.  And we said it on the air.  They're scripting actual shows instead of, because they don't want to invest the time  of having the cameras, like you just said, 24 hours a day for a long period of time so 
[02:11:30]  you can finally capture the good stuff.  So they're trying to get the good stuff by writing material for these guys.  It's wrecking reality shows.  And here's what, and let me go into this completely.  When they first asked me to do this, I said to them, I said, guys, first of all, I was  being funny.  I go, my acting skills are limited.  So scripting me to be like, you are beautiful.  Now let's argue at the jacuzzi.  Yeah.  The jacuzzi argument is so phony because you're watching, let's call it straight.  You're watching The Bachelor.  These girls don't know this guy.  And I don't care what anyone says.  But you go into reality TV, you cannot tell me that they fell in love the first fucking 
[02:12:00]  night.  I mean, they all love this guy.  No one's met him.  And now they're punching each other in the face at the jacuzzi.  I'm like, man, I've been trying to rock start for 20 years.  I use the term trying, ups and downs, right?  And I go, they don't fight that.  They don't catfight every single second that we're.  So what happened with VH1 in this show is I went and I said, guys, can I just do this?  Because originally they only bought six episodes.  That's all they were doing with me because they wasn't sure how the white guy was going 
[02:12:30]  to fly after Flavor of Love.  I knew what they were saying.  I said, I'll tell you what, as long as you don't script it and you let me come in, let  me ride my Harley in.  I don't want to shoot this at my ranch.  Let's tell them this isn't my house.  It's not my house.  Anyone that saw Cribs knows I don't live in this house.  You know what I mean?  And that wasn't.  Is that an actual house?  Is it a set?  No, here's what it is.  It's a guy.  It was a porn director, not a porn star, but a porn director from the 60s.  It's the most god-awful, ugly house I've ever been in. 
[02:13:00]  We walked in.  It stinks of pool.  Bad chlorine on the jacuzzi.  I went to step in the jacuzzi.  I'm like, uh-oh, we're going to have a bad argument.  This jacuzzi is going to be fake.  Everyone's going to hate it.  We never got to the jacuzzi except to fall in it.  I walked in.  The jacuzzi is about 11 feet deep.  If you go to go under, you're like, and you're under, you're down at the bottom swimming.  It's like a bad movie.  And it's horribly designed, that house, but great, great house to party in and do reality.  Anyway, going back to your talking about reality, I watch all these shows, and they're so scripted. 
[02:13:30]  And I know the world knows it.  With this, they just busted loose.  I mean, how many girls go out, ride dirt bikes, get hurt, play lingerie mud football, which never ended up in lingerie.  They just had shorts.  And full contact, the girl breaks her ankle.  I mean, they get tattoos.  Her first tattoo ever is my name on her neck.  I said, you could get booted off and may have.  You know, so the face plant I saw, you were just over on Channel 11 over here in New York, and we were watching some of the clips. 
[02:14:00]  And that face plant that that chick takes off of that dirt bike is hysterical.  And she endos.  Oh, my God.  There's one that goes up in the air.  And I said, I've been riding a long time, and I still don't got it down.  And the girl's like, don't tell me how to ride.  I can go fast.  She took off, hit the thing, endoed, flipped.  Yeah, she hit it like a whoop-dee-doo.  If you're going straight, if you're going straight, that's fine.  You know, she might be able to go from point A to point B. 
[02:14:30]  But I could see before she even hit that thing, it was over, man.  You knew it was a disaster.  She starts, she can't, the handlebars are going, and she face plants.  It's stunning.  Yes, it is.  Put it this way, the cracked tailbone doesn't make for good sense.  And here was my worst disaster that happened.  One of the prettiest girls on the show, we play football, right?  We go out, and they wet the field in the mud.  Now, mud looks cool when you're doing those new dives in slow-mo.  But when you're running in the mud, it sucks because you can't get going. 
[02:15:00]  You can't. You get stuck.  We fell about 60 times.  When we were done, we had pulled every muscle.  So the girl that wins the date can't move her leg.  She's like this.  Hold on a minute.  You know, she's like, I'm like, that's not going to really pan out for me later on too well.  It was fun to do during the time we were shooting.  That'd be great for you.  She can't close them.  You're trying to fuck her.  She's just got to keep her legs open.  I'm stuck.  But she didn't go that way.  She went this way.  Now I was really fucked.  Oh, you couldn't open them up.  It was like a chicken wing.  I got chicken winged and mermaided. 
[02:15:30]  When a girl mermaids you on the date, you're screwed.  Mermaids you.  Oh, that's beautiful.  She mermaided me, dude.  She mermaided me.  I got screwed.  And not literally.  Hey, who came up with the concept?  I thought that was the greatest beginning as far as how you had all the girls out in the driveway and then you had your security person weed out the horrific ones that they could not even go into the house.  Well, see, they didn't tell me they did that because I got – I don't know if they showed this on the first episode because I'm seeing bits and pieces of the first episode because we're on the road, right? 
[02:16:00]  And here's what kind of pissed me off with John, and I was being funny when I said it.  I didn't get to meet all 25.  Like when I pulled in, I know I may not be the fastest, but I'm pretty sure there's 25 girls.  You know, I looked.  I pulled in.  I'm like, okay.  They all look decent to me.  They all look like we're going to have a good time.  I get into the house, and I'm looking around, and I was shooting pictures, and I'm like, okay, 19, 20, maybe 21.  I'm like, there's not 25 girls, so I figured a couple of them are out by the pool or doing something. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, I thought you were giving the ages because –  We saw a couple pushing 50 there, Brett.  It was 21 to 70.  I was going to say, believe me, they did you a favor, those five that they got rid of.  Was that John did me a solid?  Yeah.  They all look like they signed the Declaration of Independence.  Hey, isn't this my mom's friend?  Yeah, exactly.  There are a few that were up there, Brett. 
[02:17:00]  It was a couple of wrecks.  John did me a solid.  That's what you're saying.  Okay, good.  Big time.  What we like about the show, Bill Burr brought it up.  You guys got great bits.  Thank you.  You know, when they were phone sexing, that was on this week sometime.  I saw that DVR.  They had – it was hooked up to your dick?  Pretty much.  And what it was is it's something they actually use.  Oh, they're horrified in the studio.  They go, ah, this XM, we could just go with it here.  They do use that stuff, though.  Like, Brett's been fired from it. 
[02:17:30]  Can we remove Brett from this show immediately?  Immediately.  It wouldn't be the first time that a PR person takes a guest off our show.  What they did is they did it.  It's actually used to measure, like, blood pressure or blood flow.  And being a diabetic, I know what it is because they do it for, like, your feet.  You know, they do it after – I've been diabetic so long that they do it to make sure the shit's still working.  Make sure there's blood flowing through you.  Luckily, I got a little blood flow still going through there, and it's all still doing what it's supposed to do.  And they hooked it up, and it was a very uncomfortable move for me because when you're doing stuff and you're being funny on a tour bus, that's one thing. 
[02:18:00]  When you're doing it and there's a crew of people filming you doing it, you're like, this is kind of weird.  You know what I mean?  And then I'm sitting there in those god-awful pajamas that I had made.  I thought they would look funny, and it looked like I just had orange face.  I mean, there was something going on that wasn't good.  And I'm like, I don't look good, but just let's roll with it.  I was really unhappy, actually.  I said that on the air.  My face looked orange.  Can I say what I – I said you looked kind of ridiculous in your pajamas.  I look stupid.  You can say it.  You look like a circus clown without the makeup on. 
[02:18:30]  I thought I was going to look rock star.  There was something going on there.  I'm like, wow.  Can we be funny for a minute here?  Let's go.  You know, when you're thinking in your brain, this is the story of my life, right?  My book should be called In Spite of Myself because in my brain, I thought these flame-looking pajamas can't go bad.  Right, right, right.  On camera, I looked like an idiot.  And I was the first to admit it.  All right, good.  Because I was like, whoa.  When I walked out, I looked uncomfortable.  You had no confidence.  I was like, listen, they're going to hook this thing to my dick.  And I look like town clown, okay? 
[02:19:00]  So just – I thought at this point five of the girls may eliminate themselves.  There was a weird color to your face.  I don't know if it was coming off the orange-flamed pajamas.  It's called orange.  I had an orange face.  Yeah, okay.  Remember the bad suntan cream we give you?  It looked like I had missed behind the ears and it was a bad scene going off.  I'm glad you admitted that.  You're all right, bro.  You're all right.  Because we all know that.  We all have to know when we've got to say, I lost this battle.  So they got you hooked up and then the girls had to talk dirty to you.  And some of the girls were hacks. 
[02:19:30]  And then some just went at it.  Like, I want to suck your dick.  I want to blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, Rodeo, she was good.  Was it Rodeo?  I don't know the names yet.  I'm still getting to know.  Yeah, some of them I knew their voices.  And the one girl goes – she was talking and she goes – she was really hammered.  She goes, don't threaten me with a good time.  And I was like –  Well, I love Tiffany.  But I was like –  I was like, okay, that's not going.  And then a couple of them were really sexy, like the English bit.  And, you know, there was some good stuff.  And it feels weird when they're filming you and you're kind of getting excited. 
[02:20:00]  And I'm like, what am I going to do about this?  I can't jerk off here.  I'm not going to –  Like, nothing is going to come from this right now.  That would have been a great episode if you just jerked off and chased the crew.  Look, you see the orange pajamas just moving around.  And the leg going out.  We were laughing about that before.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  I'm going, I'm not.  I just cut you loose.  There's no real good time happening.  She's off the show.  Why?  You guys should have kept her around for a few more weeks. 
[02:20:30]  But here's the reality of reality, right?  And when they – with this show, they let me do what I wanted.  Like, all the things were my ideas.  You know, I take full responsibility for the goodness and the stupidity in my pajamas.  You know, because they were telling me those don't look really good.  I'm like, no, I look killer.  Dude, they're rocking.  Look at me.  I'm great.  Come on.  I look killer.  And then it didn't really pan out so good.  I think the boys are going to be making fun of you for a while on that one.  You know what?  I haven't lived that one down yet.  Good, good, good. 
[02:21:00]  And you shouldn't.  You got it bad sometimes.  Just think of my day in my pajamas.  All right.  Oh, we do just the dumbest thing around here.  Forget it.  It lasts, like, weeks.  You're never going to live it down.  We'll just make fun of the person.  That's the whole point of having friends, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Good.  And it's funny.  My friend I just saw last night met you casually.  He's a comedian.  He did a big festival you guys did.  Rock in Oklahoma.  Yeah, Jim.  And he said he was on the bus with Brett.  And he said he really does work 12 chicks at a time.  It's a fucking miracle.  He keeps everybody happy. 
[02:21:30]  Makes sure everybody's drinks are full.  He's a great guy.  And then all of a sudden he disappears into the back.  And there's a Star Trek door that opens on the tour bus.  And one of the girls is gone.  And you're like, oh.  Star Trek door.  We were playing cards back there.  But for everyone else, it looks sexy as hell when you shut the Star Trek door.  They're going to think we're screwing.  You want to finish this game of Parcheesi before we go?  Yeah, they think you're fucking.  They hear Yahtzee.  They're like, what is he doing?  Remember, what was that game where you punked it?  Kaplago.  No, Boggle?  Was it Boggle?  There were a few.  Trouble was one.  Oh, Trouble.  Trouble, thank you.  Where you pop a six and you move twice, race your man around the track and try to send 
[02:22:00]  the others back.  But yeah, Rock in Oklahoma.  Not only was it a great show for rock fans, but Poison, it was funny because a lot of the  bands were down there.  They sounded great.  We just brought, because we're out in a row, we brought the full show.  I mean, we went big rock and had a great time, but the after party on my bus was out of control.  It was one of those ones.  We had a bunch of guys.  I'm a big supporter of our troops.  So I had a bunch of the Marines up there and a bunch of my buddies were going off to  Iraq the next day.  I said, guys, if you're going to Iraq, let's get you hammered now before you go. 
[02:22:30]  And he looked over at the girl's ass.  He goes, that's why I do it.  I mean, he goes, that's why we do it.  And I go, hoorah.  And then he, you know.  So you could stay here and fuck them?  That's why he did it.  They are heroes.  That's why he did it.  God damn.  What a selfless person.  Really?  It seems like a lot of the great rock from the 80s and stuff like that, like all the  bands are touring again, man.  It seems like everybody's going out and making money again.  It's cool to see.  We've been fortunate with our band.  And I want to say this.  We've been lucky because we've had really loyal fans. 
[02:23:00]  And even through, and I used Jon Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and a few of us that  have stayed at the top of the game through any genre, you know, you have a couple that  sort of stay there and kind of stay in the arenas and play.  And fortunately, I just want to say this for all the bands that came out in the, you know,  the 80s, late 80s, early 90s, really good, as much as we took a beating, and we can openly  say critically and all around, all of us were players. 
[02:23:30]  Like all of us could, you know, you went in and listened to a band, whether they stayed  huge or not, a lot of these guys were really great musicians, aside from the hairband thing  and all that stuff.  They were good players.  And then when Poison was out, I saw where the future was going, and we took Alice in Chains  out in a row with us.  Their first arena shows were with Poison, and Jerry's still a buddy of mine.  But music's always evolving, and I don't think it was ever meant to stop in 1988.  Like I never said, this is where music's going to stop. 
[02:24:00]  It's the greatest era ever.  You know, I was just like...  You guys always made the best of it, I'll tell you that, because there was no...  There's been no era in rock that was full of such excess and such people that wanted  to be rock stars.  When you watch these bands, all you thought was, I want to be a fucking rock star.  Look at what these guys are doing.  Right.  It was nothing.  The videos were all this backstage chicks drinking.  It was just...  It looked like a good goddamn time.  It looked awful, man. 
[02:24:30]  Like, I can't have any of this going on.  What a horrible thing that was happening.  God forbid, I can't believe we're having a good time at this backstage festival.  Yeah.  It just always looked like, Jesus Christ, that's what everybody wants to be.  Girls going to the shows in their lingerie.  Yeah.  They just...  And then as time goes by...  Well, now, time went by.  You hit the 90s, a lot of the grunge stuff, and some of the bands still tried to tour in these  places, and it just didn't work.  I remember once, and I'll never forget it, seeing... 
[02:25:00]  I think it was Warrant in the 90s, and at one point, the drummer threw his sticks out,  and I heard him go, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, on the floor, and it was like,  wow, that's got to hurt, man.  Well, you know what it is, too?  Here's...  Let's...  I love this conversation, because it...  For me, and especially for me, it hits home in this way.  We...  I think you've got to go back and look at...  You go back and look at those bands, everyone was having a great time, you know, and this  is no diss to Warrant, or Winger, or any of those bands, because they're all still out 
[02:25:30]  there...  Here's where you've got to give them credit.  They're still out there playing through thick and thin.  A lot of bands that happened in the 90s, the minute there wasn't success, they're like,  fuck this, I don't want to play no more.  I mean, the minute it...  You know, because a lot of those bands also...  And I don't mean this in a bad way.  You know, you take Cobain.  Some of those bands were...  That era of music was really depressing, but some of those guys were...  And obviously, by his death, his suicide, were really depressed.  They weren't faking that depression.  Right, right.  The depression was deep, and it's a shame, because he had great music, but here's the 
[02:26:00]  thing, a lot of that era completely died, too.  It just didn't get as beat up as our era.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're going to live big, meaning if you're going to live excessive, you also got to remember,  you're going to take that beating when it comes down.  I think it has to do with what the next transition is, and it transitioned into this, let's  strip it down, let's, like, how we really feel.  So, a lot of the hair bands became like, what the fuck are these guys doing with the makeup  and the, you know, the big hair and everything? 
[02:26:30]  It's like, you know, it became like a joke.  And it was a rebuttal, kind of, to what...  I mean, it was a backlash, but here's what the thing was, was funny with Poison.  We always have been kind of that island unto herself, because no matter what, and again,  in spite of ourselves, we were one of these bands who grew up, small garage band, Mechanicsburg,  Pennsylvania.  I mean, and we knew that it's always evolving, and the thing we did, the one thing we did  when the whole music changed, right, or what was happening then, you know, changed a bit, 
[02:27:00]  our band never went in and said we hated what we did.  And the mistake, the bands of the 80s made a lot of them.  Every one of them was like, I was never in that band.  And that's a diss to the fans, man.  Yeah, yeah.  If I grew up and bought every Kiss record, right, and all of a sudden Gene Simmons said,  I've hated, or Paul said, I hated everything I did, or Robert Plant said, I think everything  I did before now sucked, I'd be like, what do I do with the 42 albums or 8-tracks I purchased?  Yeah, that was like that guy in Warren, like, he, like, said I could kill myself for writing 
[02:27:30]  that Cherry Pie song, and just, like, flipping out about, like, he was like a borderline suicidal.  And suicidal, but he never, here's the thing that's funny, they never said that shit, though,  when it was happening.  Right, exactly.  What I'm saying is as soon as it turned a little, everyone's like, that isn't me, and I'm like,  listen, we did Native Tongue, it was a successful record for us, Bon Jovi and Poison were the  only two bands of that era that stayed in the arena throughout our career, but because both  of us said, hey, I wrote this, I admit my hair did look a little ridiculous, but at the  same time, I did, I lived and loved what I was doing. 
[02:28:00]  Brett, know what happened, you guys had more going on as a band, though, because I was  a DJ, you know, in the 80s, and what happened was, these hair bands, like, the first group  had major talent, and then everyone else said, wow, this is my in in the music business, so  everyone did the hair band sound, and then everyone had to have a power ballad, and then  what happens, it gets watered down.  Absolutely.  And then, like, they forget that Poison is bigger than the genre, and you get kind of thrown  away with everybody.  Absolutely. 
[02:28:30]  That's exactly what happened with the hair bands, because I saw it coming, I'm like,  you know, when the power ballad first hit, it was like, wow, this is a cool concept, a  rock band actually really slowing it down, and everyone getting their lyres out and stuff,  but then every band that came out in that five-year period had to have the power ballad.  They made a formula.  It was a formula, there you go.  Talking about, like, rock of love, and what happened with Every Rose, Every Rose for us, like,  we took, and we mix it up a little bit, because Poison, it's funny, each member, like,  CeCe's from Brooklyn, New York.  We love CeCe, by the way.  He is awesome. 
[02:29:00]  He's done our show many times over the years.  Yeah, and he does that CBGB, you know, he's very the Ramones-y kind of, and then I come  in and I sort of bring a little bit of, I want to say, the Skinner, Zeppelin, I'm a  classic rock, you know what I mean, mixed with some, my dad was a big country fan, so I  grew up with a lot of that Americana feel, and then the other guys bring in, Ricky likes  that Bowie kind of feel, and each of us adds an element, but when Every Rose hit, you  nailed it, when Every Rose hit, our, including Capitol Records, nobody, but nobody thought 
[02:29:30]  that song would be a success, and we were one of those bands that was fortunate, because  no one in the beginning of our career wanted our publishing.  Everyone's like, you guys will never have more than one single, blah, blah, blah, and  we were, we were one of the fortunate bands that just, like Metallica, we just, you know,  I said, if I'm going to make it, let's make it on our own terms, and why give away my  life, if we hit, why take some shitty advance, meaning business-wise, I'm saying, why take  some bad advance, they're going to come chasing me for, if I don't have another hit, let's 
[02:30:00]  just take it when we, if it writes and it's a hit.  So many bands considered that, making it.  Hey, great, we're in huge debt, we made it, this is great, this is the best.  Let's get a hold of J.G.  Wentworth.  Yeah, this is great, and we've given away rights to everything we've ever worked on since  I was 13 years old, forever, forever, forever, this is great.  How does that work as far as, like, you get that advance, okay, the band gets an advance,  and then their album flops, you're saying you've got to pay them back, what, do they  just put you on the road? 
[02:30:30]  I don't know how they, literally, I don't know how some of those bands did it.  With ours, we've kept all of our masters and all of our, like, we are an independent  band.  Our first album, Cat Dragged In, was on Cyanide Music, on Enigma, meaning, when I say Enigma  records, they were distribution from a warehouse that we packed the shit up ourselves, and then  when we, and then when that record ended up, Talk Dirty to Me busted loose, and it really  became a fan hit, not that, remember the early 90s when they could buy marketing teams to call  in and say, make that song a hit? 
[02:31:00]  We actually came from an era where we didn't know what the fuck that was, so our real fans  were actually calling in, and then...  Just to explain, yeah, radio stations or record companies would, like, hire marketing companies,  and their whole job is to get young, you know, guys, girls, what have you, flooding radio  stations, you know, requesting, let's say, a poison song.  Requesting the songs to make that, oh, jeez.  And then the station's like, wow, this must be a hit, what, what is it, what's good?  Yeah, and then the band would come to town.  And no one knew for the first, you know, few years.  Right, and then that band would come to town, and how you would know, they'd go to sell 
[02:31:30]  an arena, and there'd be, like, four people to get it.  Yeah.  Hey, where are all the phone callers?  What happened?  All from the same marketing firm.  Hey, Jesus Christ, we got our signage up and everything, and now we're  It was huge in the late 80s, yeah.  They would hire these marketing firms to pump up these records for these guys.  Yeah, we just weren't smart enough to do that, so it turned out to be a blessing.  Right, right, right.  You know the first metal band to do very soft music on their, uh...  Let me think.  Black Sabbath.  Yes!  I love it.  Yes!  We love the Sabbath. 
[02:32:00]  Jimmy loves Sabbath.  Look at that.  Come on, if she's gone off technical ecstasy or exchanges, or they always did solitude off  mastery, they always did a very soft, and then kissed it in, like, 76.  Every bad boy has a soft side.  Everybody thought it was, uh, you know, it was kisses eventually.  I love that one.  Every bad boy has his soft side.  The voice has to change, right?  Have you ever listened to the music when they do, like, we were going back to a reality show  talking about rock and love?  It is the...  It's funny, because when you do that, it is the weirdest thing, because you gotta forget 
[02:32:30]  that a camera is...  Like, so I wanna talk to the camera, I'm like, man, dude, how's your face?  Is your daughter...  I was like...  Don't talk.  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I'm like...  And it's weird for me, because I'm not used to...  You know what I'm saying?  I'm used to, like, hey, what are you doing?  Yeah, just talking to people.  Yeah.  That must be odd when you watch after it's been done, and it's on TV, because the music  is pretty funny.  Yes.  There's this dramatic tone to...  You know, there's what amounts to...  I'm sorry, some whore trying to, like, make her way in life.  Yeah, but that's good. 
[02:33:00]  No, that's great.  It's great.  Everyone needs a chance.  Great for bread.  Exactly.  I mean, believe me, it's fantastic.  Great for bread.  It's fantastic.  It's like you share the wealth a little bit.  There's this dramatic music playing, like she's the first lady in danger or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just fantastic, man.  Did you hear the knocking on the door, too?  We added...  Yeah, yeah.  What was cool about the show, as I said, guys, when we do this, can we please do all  the things that we all...  And I'm a big Will Ferrell fan and all that, where they actually take...  No, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  I was like...  I said, please, let's have some humor on this show and make it, along with the cat fights 
[02:33:30]  and whatever else we do, just have a good time.  And I think that's what...  The reason this thing has been their number one show this season, and we beat the first  season of Flavor Loves ratings and the new Hulk Hogan ratings, which...  And the thing for me is I've never done a TV show.  So, for a lot of the fans out there, I want to thank them for tuning in, because it's...  It's...  It turned out to be a pretty huge show.  Hey, dude...  So, just out of the reality of it, you know?  One of the best things about being a rock star is, I heard David Lee Roth used to just 
[02:34:00]  go into scores and other cores.  Yeah.  Coming down cores.  Do you...  Like, to me, like, you always, for the rest of your life, have a guarantee of fucking  banging chicks, because all you gotta do is go into a strip club, something is  gonna play, and you're gonna fuck one of the girls.  I mean...  How great is that?  Especially if you say, if you slip the DJ a couple bucks.  Yeah, right?  Oh, I just happen to be sitting back here at this table, and my song...  Yeah.  How did my song get on?  Is that me?  Oh, and the girl...  Oh, this is my favorite song! 
[02:34:30]  I love this song!  And she's ripping her clothes off.  When you wait, you can...  What you have to do is scan through the club, because a couple of them are like, oh, I  hate this song.  That's so blah.  And you're like, no, no, no.  Yes.  The guys that light up, and you go, that shall be the one I'll spend my 20s on.  Oh, I love how he's pulling back the curtain.  Yeah.  That's it, huh?  Never mind the wizard.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Let's say hi to Dave in Wisconsin.  Dave, what's up?  Hold on.  Brett won't be able to hear what he's doing.  I'll just put it up to your ear.  You don't have to put him on.  Hold on, Dave.  Hold on.  You don't have to put him on.  Just put it up to your ear.  Dave, what's up? 
[02:35:00]  Hey, what's going on?  This is Davin calling from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  Okay.  Amen.  Just saw Poison Saturday night at the Fond du Lac fair.  Which was an awesome...  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah, dude, it was just a great show.  You guys blew up something with the power generator right in the beginning there and got her back on.  I guess I was just wondering, did you catch any flack for the video that you had playing on the screen behind the stage?  No, nothing at all.  You know what's funny? 
[02:35:30]  We came out on the stage and when we were in Fond du Lac, he's talking outside of Green Bay, Wisconsin, we did a big rock festival there.  And we went on stage and we blew out...  Because a lot of the fairs and festivals don't carry a lot of power, we blew all the shit out.  You know what I mean?  So we stopped the show.  I mean, I'm coming up on this big elevator thing to bring...  I'm like, I'm the greatest!  And then it stopped like halfway up and I had to like crawl up.  You had a spinal tap moment.  No, my life is spinal tap moments, right? 
[02:36:00]  Spinal tap moment.  I'm literally coming up on the elevator thing and I'm like, I'm the greatest!  And then all of a sudden...  We walk out with a bullhorn thing and we're telling people, we'll be right back.  They broke the attendance record there.  It was like the biggest crowd they'd ever seen there, ever.  And I'm like, we'll be right back.  Get a sandwich, grab a beer.  And then we came back out and restarted the entire show.  Yeah, how do you get the momentum going again?  You just come back out.  I got in the mic.  I said, we're sorry.  Here we go.  Take two. 
[02:36:30]  At least you know the music's real.  You know, all the instruments were like...  You know?  I said, hey, the place was actually loved it better that we didn't get all pissed off and  busted.  We just were like, shit happens.  Shit happens.  This guy's talking about a video of a naked woman, though.  Yeah, there was...  That was playing.  You didn't get in trouble for that?  No.  We have a couple of screens that we shoot.  We have some big screen stuff that's behind us.  And there's like a girl dancing around, like a stripper dancing around on one of the songs.  I don't...  If we did, I sure didn't hear about it. 
[02:37:00]  Give us another Spinal Tap moment.  Oh, my God.  We've got to have a million.  Did you have time?  Give us another good one.  We love asking you guys for your Spinal Tap moment.  Here's one of my finest, finest ever Spinal Tap moments.  Now, can I go back to the club days?  Like the club, club days.  We were playing a place called the Pine Grove Inn in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania.  I'd have to read the set list and would say like, you got another thing coming, Judas Priest.  Living after midnight.  And then announce two for one nickel tuggers.  And, you know, to nickel drafts. 
[02:37:30]  And then I would have to say, shake your hiney at the piney.  Here's our next song.  This is no lie.  Our dressing room, I have this on video to prove it on Betamax.  We would have to dress.  Like people would have to walk past us, all four of them, to get to the bathroom.  You took a shit beside the stage.  I would have to change it in my spandex.  I'm like, hey, how you doing, buddy?  You know, I'm putting my furry leg warmers on because I wanted to give them a show.  I always wanted to give them a show.  Oh, yeah.  But then Texas Jam. 
[02:38:00]  Let's cut a little to the future.  87.  We're playing Texas Stadium.  83,000 people.  Wow.  I'm walking to the stage with Paul Stanley on my left, Stephen Tyler on my right.  They're giving me advice.  I'm about to crap myself because I'm so nervous.  I get up on the stage.  And we had another Spinal Tap moment.  The mic didn't work.  I'm like, Texas, you rock.  And then we went to the cord, which left me about two inches of room to move.  We're filming the I Won't Forget You video.  Paul Stanley comes out.  He plays Strutter with us on stage. 
[02:38:30]  Place goes nuts.  I go backstage afterwards.  I go to jump.  Now, in my mind, I live out a lot of my childhood fantasies of what rock is.  You know, because you want to live it out, right?  I'm like, I got two beers, and then this girl named Jerry Miller from Metal Edge was shooting  a big pictorial thing in Rolling Stone backstage.  I dive into the fountain, which looks mighty deep.  It's a facade.  The fountain's about two inches deep.  I'm like, I'm not great. 
[02:39:00]  You know, one of those.  I threw the rock horns, dove in, and landed, and I busted my fucking tailbone.  And the rest of the day, I'm like walking around with, you know, bad hair, leg warmers,  and spandex soaked.  And it was a good time.  But we went.  Here was my best lesson.  I'm going to get serious now.  Hold on.  I'm going to get serious.  I won't put you to sleep, though.  My best lesson ever.  We drove out of there.  That night, 83,000.  This rocked.  Life was good.  We get to Carl's Corner, Texas.  And we're at a truck stop.  And I just left the place with people going insane. 
[02:39:30]  And this was the best moment of my life.  There wasn't one person there knew or gave a shit who we were.  And it was the best lesson.  I said, you know what?  All fame is fleeting.  Do it for the right reason.  Enjoy making music.  And don't bust your tailbone in a facade pole or fountain anymore.  But it was a great lesson.  Good lesson learned.  What advice does Steven Tyler give you before you go out in front of 80,000 people?  Make sure your mic works, dude.  Oh, it does.  I'm sure of that.  They've had people check it.  He was saying, you know, I was going to, he goes, don't be nervous. 
[02:40:00]  Go up there, man.  You guys are going to be great.  And then we, a year later, we toured with him and did all the soccer stadiums in Europe.  And he was the coolest, coolest.  You know when you meet somebody?  80,000 people.  Can we bring up a topic that's really on my mind now?  All right.  Did you ever go and meet somebody?  I'm not going to throw anyone under the bus yet.  And they just suck, dude.  Can I tell you my biggest fear in life?  I vowed, and I won't say who this was because it was one of my greatest idols ever.  And it wasn't Robert Plant or Tyler because they were cool.  I met one of my biggest idols ever, and he was such a dick. 
[02:40:30]  And I vowed.  And now I'm like nervous.  Like, even backstage, I'm like, oh, they're here.  I'm like, find out if they're cool first because I don't.  Like, in my brain, I've got the posters and the shit.  I'm like.  How is he a dick, though?  How is he a dick?  Like, what was he?  Was he a drool?  Completely, just condescending, cocky, arrogant dick.  So was he with Paul Stanley when you met him?  No.  It wasn't Gene.  Believe it or not, you guys are going to laugh at Gene.  We were kind of disappointed with Gene from time to time on our show. 
[02:41:00]  I know you have, and I've listened.  Believe me, I'm a listener, so I know.  You listen to our show?  We've had great times with Gene, and we've had awful times with Gene.  And we've had not-so-good times with Gene.  But I love Gene.  I had a big run-in with him, and I trashed him on the air, and I fan, actually.  That had nothing to do with it, though.  Well, no, no, this was after, and I trashed him, and he was hosting an event that I was  a judge on in front of 3,000 people, and this little maniac fan came up and confronted  Gene for not taking a photo with me, so he hugged me in front of 3,000 people.  Really homoerotic, but I mean, it didn't kind of bring it all home and make it okay. 
[02:41:30]  No, but here's the thing.  What you're saying is weird, and let me talk about Gene for one minute.  Gene, to me, in my career, I've been lucky because he's always been-  Poison has always said, we never tried to hide the fact I'm a Kiss fan.  Like, I was never like, oh, I've never heard of them before.  We just happened to have a couple songs that are fun like theirs, you know?  So we just address who and what we like, right?  And he's always been cool, and he was great.  You know, you're going to laugh.  He's a good magician.  You know, like, he can actually do all these tricks, and I had my daughters out on the road. 
[02:42:00]  I have two daughters, and I had them out on the road.  He's doing all these coin tricks.  I'm like, this is a surreal moment.  I'm backstage with Gene, figuring there's going to be this, you know, drugs and joints, and  all of a sudden, he's doing, like, magic tricks, and he was really good at it.  I mean, it was funny.  He's doing, I got your nose, in the back of a tour bus.  He's kind of like, yeah, you're like, you're thinking there's sex, drugs.  We're back there figuring out old car tricks, you know?  No, but he was really cool.  He doesn't drink or do drugs.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, he does nothing.  You know Kiss, right? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Okay, I would like you to help me.  I have to meet Ace Frehley.  I don't have to meet anybody.  I have to meet Ace Frehley.  I think I can help you do that.  We had him on the show.  Not when I was here.  He's the only guy I've kissed in my life in the finals.  I never met Ace Frehley, and I hear he's just a fucking problem wherever he goes.  Yeah, but you know what?  What's great about Ace, every time I've ever been around him, and especially in his drinking  days, he's sort of surreal, because it's like, he's cool.  I mean, every time I've been around him, he's, like, cool, stumbly.  And then he's kind of neurotic, and stumbly, but he is what he is. 
[02:43:00]  Do you know what I mean?  I hope I'm saying that right.  I got the bit, Jimmy.  What?  How much you're willing to pay.  We'll put the word out.  Bring us Ace Frehley, and we pay the listener.  Okay.  I'll pay whatever you ask.  I'm thinking it could be a good little bit, though.  Someone will...  All right, bring us Ace Frehley.  Bring us Ace Frehley, and we'll take care of you.  We'll figure it out.  I'm serious.  Can I get in on that?  I haven't met.  Can I get in?  No, because you know what to ask for.  You'll ask for a lot of cash.  I don't fuck with arena money, guys.  I'm going to need a non-recoupable deal. 
[02:43:30]  How long are you guys, like, fucking around in the clubs?  In the day?  Yeah.  We started out probably...  Put it this way.  My dad drove me to most of my early gigs.  So I was about 15 when I played rhythm guitar in a band,  and then quickly realized that the singer got all the ass.  So I quickly bought the PA system.  I got a job.  That's how everybody gets in the band.  The singer buys the PA.  This is the way you do gear.  This is the funniest story ever.  The way bands are invented in Pennsylvania, it had nothing to do with your skill level. 
[02:44:00]  It had to do with what equipment...  Of course.  If you bought a bass, that's what you...  Meaning, if you sucked at it, but you owned a bass rig, you were the bass player.  Meaning, it was the drummer.  There'd be like four drummers show up, and whoever the singer was, because the PA was the most expensive.  So I went out and got a job, and I said, I gotta be the singer,  because I'm not getting any action back here as the rhythm guitar player.  I remember stealing people's floodlights from their driveways for the light show and stuff,  and just there at home drinking some beer, soldering stuff together for your light show. 
[02:44:30]  If you gave me a soldering iron and some old spotlights, I could build you one right here.  I know how to do it.  That's it, man.  Hey, when that whole 80s thing was starting, you guys survived as far as when the whole L.A. glam scene and everything died.  What were the rest of the bands doing?  Some of the bands not handle it so well?  I mean, there must have been like when stand-up goes through a dip.  I used to talk to 80s comedians, and they would talk about how there was a club on every corner,  and then all of a sudden it just died.  Yeah, you must have noticed some people that just didn't make the cut. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, you know what happens, I think, to a lot of them, like I said before?  Or they got bitter for all the wrong reasons, because you can't, you know how that saying is,  don't hate the player, hate the game?  Yeah.  It's the game you're in.  I don't think any genre was meant, like I never went in there and said,  music is going to end, this will be this for the rest of our lives.  Right.  We went in there just enjoying every day doing what we're doing.  You just ride it out.  And when things changed, I think what happened is some of them embraced it, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, 
[02:45:30]  ourselves, where we were just, I don't want to fool anybody, I just play hard rock music.  Like, I'm not going to trick anybody.  I think a lot of the bands got real, real bitter about, what happened was is,  and I'm not kidding you, we got a phone call, and I won't say from what network,  telling us they were no longer, the year before we had the number one video,  like number one all time, beating out Faith No More.  All of a sudden we handed them a video, they're like,  we're really not playing your style of music anymore.  Video network from the 80s.  Or the 90s. 
[02:46:00]  I don't want to mention any names.  Wow.  But I have to say, when they told us that, this was the phone call we got.  These are, we're not playing this anymore.  When I say they turned her back, they didn't turn her back, they turned her back.  Fuck Nickelodeon.  Yes, that's exactly what I said.  That's the last time I'll go down to Nickelodeon and do my dog and pony show for them.  Wow, man, that's something.  It was that quick though, huh?  Yeah, it was pretty quick.  And I just, we knew it, but we just went on with Native Tongue and ended up having a very successful record.  And I think we've been fortunate. 
[02:46:30]  Again, I want to throw out to the fans.  I think they realize with our band that I'm a fan of music.  And when I go on stage, they know that I'm out there with them.  I'm not a, I've never gone on there with the idea that I think I'm greater, even though  I do like to throw a great after party.  We're talking about that.  But I never go on with the attitude that I'm better than this.  I just feel like Rock, La Homa was a great example of one of the best rock days.  I mean, everyone out there, you know, 40,000, 50,000 people just partying and having a time  of their life. 
[02:47:00]  It was great.  I have to ask this too, because everyone knows you dated Pam Anderson.  I heard she used to carry a photo of your penis.  Her photo?  I forced her to.  Was it a photo?  Was it on her phone?  No, she, it wasn't, we weren't real big.  We didn't have a lot of phone technology in the early, no, 95, 96 air, right?  Some technology, but we still had the big click of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it was like the Motorola, you know.  With the antenna though.  But you were rocking it, man.  I'm cool.  Hold on, let me get my shoe phone out.  Yeah.  But yeah, she had a, we had a couple of great pictures together and we kept them for medicinal 
[02:47:30]  reasons.  We would carry them with us.  And I took a picture of John Holmes' dick and said, this is me.  I just glued my head on it and said, here you go.  Early Photoshop.  And I just dimmed the lights a lot.  I'm like, you don't need to look at this.  Hold on a minute.  I did the same thing with John Holmes, but I did it with his blood test results.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Give me.  Boom.  Wow.  You go, wait, I messed up somehow.  I did the wrong thing.  They're running away from me.  What did I do? 
[02:48:00]  Show him his dick or give him these results.  What should I do?  Whatever happened to the sex tape?  Did you guys squash it?  We did.  Well, you don't.  You guys decided to squash it?  You try to.  And we did it because we both were in different relationships.  I think if we'd been together, like her and Tommy, where it's not that big of a deal  when we were together, you're like, hey, it comes out.  It's kind of fun, cool, whatever.  When you're not together and you both got kids, different relationships.  And I just said, you know what?  I think what pissed me off about it was that when you get threatened, like if I called you  out and threatened, they literally threatened Pamela and I. 
[02:48:30]  They're like, we don't give a shit what you think.  Right.  We will win this.  We put out Pam and Tommy's.  They couldn't stop that.  And then when I got mad, we just went and got a federal injunction.  And you don't ever really stop it.  You just squish it.  Just try to control it.  Yeah.  Try to keep it as controlled as you can.  As you can, you know.  It wasn't on Nickelodeon for some reason.  You guys doing any gigs around here?  We're not playing your type of video.  We got, you know, we played last night at Jones Beach at the amphitheater.  And then tonight we're doing a, we do this every year.  It's a fan jam. 
[02:49:00]  And we pick out a station in a city.  This year is New York.  We're going to do the China Club tonight where we just go old school.  I call it CBGB, but I don't have a better term.  But where it's just a couple amps, us plugged in and do the set for a bunch of fans that they  started announcing it the other day.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  And then we do, yeah.  And then we do Taj Mahal at the arena, Trump Taj Mahal.  And then Saturday we're at the PNC in New Jersey.  Oh, cool, man.  Hey, let's go to Texas.  We're talking to Bret Michaels, of course, star of Rock of Love. 
[02:49:30]  Let's not forget about his great reality show on VH1.  That's the reason he's here.  What the hell can we bring him on here for anyway?  That's the reason he really is here.  But, you know, so much to ask him.  What's up, bro?  Hey, man.  You're talking to Bret Michaels?  I don't know your name or I would have said it.  So what's your name?  I'm sorry.  My name is Bryce.  I'm just a really big fan of Bret Michaels.  And I know I'd like to get a rock scream.  Oh, wow.  I'd like to get a rock scream out of the band.  All right.  Let me explain something. 
[02:50:00]  That's a good idea.  Let me explain.  We found this on the internet.  This is fantastic.  What's this guy?  Just put your head...  No, no.  It's not you.  It's not...  No, but this...  You'll be happy it's not.  We play this as a goof, and then it just took on a life of its own.  So listen to this first.  Yeah!  Who is that guy?  It's Jim Gillette. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Teaching?  Is it a lesson?  We don't know what it is.  We believe so.  It's his rock scream.  I know the name Jim Gillette, but he teaches vocals or something.  Oh, look at that.  Is that serious?  Yeah, we played that, and it took on a life of its own, and now we do this whole thing  called Rock Scream Tuesday, and people try to imitate that.  Because we like making fun of the...  Do you want me to give you a good...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me just give all my excuses.  I sang late.  I party late.  I'm out of the way now.  Dude, we would be flattered.  Like, you don't even have to imitate that. 
[02:51:00]  Just do your own...  Just want like a Paul Stanley...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You know what he does?  Whatever you feel like doing.  Ooh, wow.  That's all I got.  I got nothing.  I sang all night.  I love that when you go to gig, and I see...  Because I'm just talking band stories.  I'm just talking band stories.  Because I know how it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know how it is.  Band stories.  When you think you're going to sound like shit.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh my God, I can't believe this.  My voice is shot.  Right.  Last night.  You go up on stage, and it's just best night of your life. 
[02:51:30]  Absolutely.  Out there, and you have no reason why.  And then there's some nights where you think you're going to kick ass, and you're like,  what the fuck is happening to my range?  Yeah, no, I live that daily.  I have that spinal tap moment daily.  The singers just have the worst position, because you don't know.  It's the best position, because you get all the pussy, but you don't know day to day if  you're going to...  Imagine the guitarist opens up his case, and it's like, oh, fuck, my guitar smashed today.  Right.  Fuck.  What am I going to do?  That's important.  If you don't...  I'll tell you what kills a singer more than anything, and this is something I fall victim  to a lot, is because we enjoy a good after party, is booze, smoke, and all that stuff 
[02:52:00]  aside, lack of sleep will kill you.  You know what I mean?  Like, when you don't sleep, and you're just...  You know, but you get up on that stage, and some nights I go on there, and I'm feeling  like, man, tonight is going to be the best night ever.  And then the monitors blow, something's not right, and you're like, you can't fix it.  It's not like a guitar.  You just turn it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Just got to go with it.  Who's the biggest animal you ever worked with?  Like, rock star animal.  Like, just like a fucking awful lifestyle you can't believe.  Like, you know, like partying. 
[02:52:30]  Like, how are they still alive?  Just exactly.  Like, how do you perform with the debauchery or the amount of...  The amount of drugs and stuff in the system.  Well, whatever it is, yeah.  Yeah, any...  You know what?  I have quite a few.  I'd probably say Cece.  Cece and Bobby are...  Cece and Bobby, I thought I could throw a pretty good party, but being diabetic, there's  a level where I have to cut it off.  Sure.  Where I'm like, I've had a good time.  I'm having fun.  But Cece would do three-nighters.  And I'm telling you, I didn't know how he performed.  Like, when I say don't know how he performed, he'd be sleeping 10 minutes before show, been  gacked out of his brain for like three days, and he would get on and Bobby, and I would 
[02:53:00]  be like, man, you...  Like, do you ever watch our Every Rose video where Bobby looks like a...  Like, he's like, you know, he can't stand...  But they could play.  Unbelievable.  Like, they would get on there and play, and I'd be like, fuck, how's he...  I don't know how he's breathing, let alone...  You know, he's doing the solo, and I'm like, a minute before we walked on, I thought  we'd have to hit him with a couple more bums just to get him to, you know, through the  show.  Hey, we gotta get Brett out of here, unfortunately.  You know, this just hit yesterday. 
[02:53:30]  Brandy C. from Rock of Love on VH1.  This will help the show, by the way.  Please.  She's a porn star.  I love...  This just came out that Brandy C. from Rock of Love on VH1 is a porn star.  She goes by the name of Brittany on the website BabyGotBoobs.com.  Baby Got...  All right.  Baby Got Boobs.com.  Is this her first porn, or has she been doing it for a while?  I better...  I honestly don't know.  I better go get tested.  Yeah, I don't know.  Why?  You had fun with Brandy C, or what?  We just talked.  Just talked a lot.  I like him already.  No bag, no nothing. 
[02:54:00]  I gave her a nice smathering.  No.  What's the most at one time you ever had?  That right there is a rock star answer.  Let me think.  Yeah, I gotta go back.  You gotta think.  Hey, turn that...  Jesus.  Texas has been real good to me.  As he thinks, there's Brandy C. from Rock of Love.  Can I go over there?  Take a look-see.  She's the one on the left.  What do you think?  Oh, yeah.  Brandy C's hot.  Wow. 
[02:54:30]  There she is as a porn star.  As Brittany on BabyGotBoobs.com.  Yeah, she's hot.  She's the one on the left, if you're looking at the...  She told me she'd never been with a guy before.  Oh, damn you!  Wow.  Yeah, she's looking pretty good on there, though.  I mean, she's doing all right.  She's playing the fiddle.  They're sharing that penis.  They're so good with it.  They both take the same amount of space on the side.  Yeah, they're equally sharing the penis there.  Yeah, no selfishness.  Just enjoying it.  No, she's awesome.  Now, is she doing this? 
[02:55:00]  This is kind of running me on.  Is this her first?  That's hilarious.  She's sitting there with a dick right in her mouth.  She's awesome.  I love her.  She sounded like she gave you a get well card or something.  Oh, what a sweetheart.  All right, let's...  What a gal.  What a gal.  They're going to be yanking him out of here.  So, Rock of Love, VH1, we're all hooked on the show.  Bill Burr came in just to meet you, because he's a big fan of the show.  Thank you, Bill. 
[02:55:30]  Well, hey, some of the things we're going to see as the show goes on.  What can you tease?  This week, most incredible, and I say this, this is what makes it so real.  These girls, including Brandy C, were such great sports, right?  But they came out, and we raced motocross this week.  Next week, we go in, we have a big rock jam.  Then we go out to the gun range, shoot.  Then we play.  You've got to check out the mud football, full contact lingerie mud.  All the contests are amazing, and you can tell none of the...  Like, you can't script that.  I mean, it's knock down, drag out, fist... 
[02:56:00]  I mean, it's good.  Blown out ACLs.  A lot of torn ACLs.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, Brett, you're really cool, man.  You've got to come back when the show's over, because we want to get all the inside scoop.  Done.  Like, how many girls you banged.  What kind of diseases you got from these broads.  You know, we're going to really get into this.  Brandy, I'm surprised she told me I was the first guy she'd ever been with.  I'm a little shocked.  Maybe they just CGI'd a penis in there.  Maybe that was actually an apple or a banana. 
[02:56:30]  I'm thinking that's what happened.  Yeah, they just photoshopped it.  I'm sure you're heartbroken, and you're going to be crying all day.  Guys, I'm going to be in a corner crying.  You're going to be over there for a while.  It's Rock of Love, Sundays at 9 p.m. on VH1.  And also, Poison has a new CD out called Poisoned, or something like that.  Brand new CD, again, on Capital UMI, just called Poisoned.  And a bunch of songs.  We just went back and did a bunch of cover songs,  because we were going to do an all-original record,  but me and Bobby got in a huge fistfight at Atlanta on stage at the arena,  and we decided to buddy up again. 
[02:57:00]  He gave me stitches in my knee.  Did you do a fistfight with a bandmate on stage?  Yeah, it's all over.  Apparently, because it was at the end of the night.  We walked out.  We had a discrepancy over the songs we were doing.  He said a few things to me.  I said, you're talking to me.  Next thing I know, I had my microphone.  He knocked it over.  I threw it at his head by accident.  Oh, shit.  I missed, which sucks, because I'm a good thrower.  I actually can throw decent, right?  I miss his head.  He ducks.  He takes his Warlock bass, which is the pointiest, sharpest bass ever made,  and he starts to do a Peter Townsend around his head with it. 
[02:57:30]  And I go, he's not going to throw that thing at me.  That will kill me.  And he chucked it right at me.  I went Kung Fu, Karate Kid.  It bounced off the stage.  It got my knee about eight stitches.  And the next day, we were best friends laughing about it.  And it's on YouTube?  It's on YouTube somewhere.  Oh, I'll check that out.  Wow.  Yeah, there's something.  It's awful.  It's like, you know, you can tell it's like a bunch of phones.  What was the argument over the songs?  We were deciding what songs to put in or not put in the set  and what we wanted to end the night with,  whether, you know, talk dirty to me, nothing but a good time. 
[02:58:00]  It doesn't have to be a real subject.  They'll argue over anything.  That's what's fun about it, because I know if I ask that question,  it'll be something so stupid.  It'll be something ridiculous.  It's the only way we know how to fight.  It can't be something intelligent.  Come on.  They were arguing over whose penis that was in the video.  That was mine.  Damn her.  She looks hot in that.  She's lovely.  She looks hot in that shot right there.  All right.  We're out, man.  All right.  I'm out.  Thank you guys for having me.  Brett Michaels, man.  Come back, please.  And he's a fan of the show.  How cool is that?  Rock of Love, Sundays at 9 p.m. on VH1. 
[02:58:30]  It's Brett Michaels.  BrettMichaels.com, everyone.  That was great.  Thanks, Brett.  Pleasure.  We'll go to break and continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I definitely want a picture.  Of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  You threw me off a little, Jimmy.  Why, sweetie?  I was trying to take care of you.  I think I got a really good idea.  And you were like, you're crazy.  I want someone to bring us Ace Freely.  Back in the day, we used to tell our listeners to bring us something. 
[02:59:00]  And I remember at the time we said, bring us a 7-Eleven worker.  A convenience store worker, yeah.  We wanted a foreign 7-Eleven worker.  We got one.  And we put out a prize.  And the listener, oh, sorry.  The listener actually kidnapped a foreign 7-Eleven worker to win the prize.  She didn't know why she was down there.  I think it was Grateful Dead tickets or something.  Was it?  But you said how much money.  It's like, I don't know because it's hard to bring Ace in.  He's not like an object.  And that's why we have to get the listeners involved. 
[02:59:30]  They'll start knocking on his door.  Like, can you help me win some money?  Little Jimmy needs to meet you.  And I get money out of it.  I just want to.  He's the only guy in Kiss I haven't met.  And the next thing you know, we're going to get a phone call one day.  And they're going to say, Ace Freely is here for Jim Norton.  You might be tied up and gagged, but you'll meet him finally.  How many people in Sha-na-na do you need to meet?  Bowser.  I met the fat one that sang Earth Angel.  Did you?  I only want to meet Ace.  He's over at Jimmy's apartment and he's got pictures of the guys in the gold suits with  no shirts on. 
[03:00:00]  Jimmy just thrilled.  I got everyone.  It's unbelievable.  But Ace, I don't have.  And he fucking would sing, back in the New York groove.  And that's exactly how he sang it live.  I'm back.  I'm back in the New York groove.  How do you not love Ace?  Hey, can we get your version of that, please?  Is E-Rock still working?  I really do like the...  Hey, can I...  Jimmy's version of that is great.  I forgot about that.  Have you ever seen his...  Like, I was...  Your old apartment.  His collection of pictures is unbelievable.  That was shitty, like, 25 little shots on the wall. 
[03:00:30]  Jimmy's got a...  Hey.  It's like the hard rock.  Hey, really?  Remember, Bill is on the wall.  Before we move on, I want to help out the haters.  Hmm?  I want to help out the haters, okay?  How?  Half a cunt face from Wackbag.  Half a cunt face?  We have been on to you for so long, I can't even tell you.  So, I'm going to do you a favor.  You're a hater of this radio show.  It's time to change your name, so then we'll take your instant feedback serious again.  I'll help the haters out. 
[03:01:00]  Half a cunt face, we've been on to you for a long time.  I never heard of them.  That doesn't like anything we do.  Every day, it's a negative comment about whatever we're doing at that time.  And see, it works if you change your name.  So, you've got to change your name to something new, and then maybe you'll get to us.  I'm just going to help the haters at this point.  Give them a little helping hand.  Yeah, because he writes, this interview sucks, let me know when it's done so I can tune back  in and listen again.  And that's right around the same instant feedback that's, like Eric from North Carolina, right  next to him.  One of the best interviews ever. 
[03:01:30]  Bring Brett back soon.  We love him.  This was really cool.  Blah, blah, blah.  He probably liked the beginning of the show today where E-Rock was on the pole dancing naked.  That seems probably more his style.  Nude men.  More people on instant feedback, exactly, are saying how great Brett Michaels was, and that  was a really cool segment.  So, I'm going to try to start helping the haters.  You can't please them all.  No, I understand that.  I don't want to, because I understand what they're all about, but I want to help them. 
[03:02:00]  Half a cunt face, we've been on to you for so fucking long.  Just change your name, and then you can continue writing your name.  Full cunt face.  Half a cunt face.  It's going to be full cunt face.  That's like half a fag.  Yeah, half a cunt face.  I love these guys, though.  You know, we read instant feedback every day.  Well, we know which ones are the haters that are just trying to get to us, whether they're  a Howard Stern fan or something else that's going on.  So, I just want to help guys like half a cunt face.  We're on to you.  So, if you want to get back in the game where you think you're trying to get under our skin,  you've got to change your name at this point. 
[03:02:30]  All right?  Here's the thing.  There you go.  I don't know this half a cunt face.  I don't know what he does.  All I care about is I like him if he knows Ace Freely.  I don't if he doesn't.  I only want Ace, and I want to sing with him.  We're back in the New York groove.  I love that.  I like that.  I love Jimmy's version.  By the way, I want to help another hater out because he doesn't think we're on to him.  Muffle Voice says, half a cunt face is right.  It sucks.  You ass kissers.  Muffle Voice, we've been on to you for months as well.  Not Muffle Voice.  Not Lee.  I don't know who these guys are. 
[03:03:00]  I've never heard of them.  You also have to change your screen name if you want to start getting back into trying  to get under our skin.  Muffle Voice.  I love these guys.  Is he from the Pittsburgh Muffle Voices?  He's never heard of him.  These douches, they write in and they don't think we're on to the screen names.  They're on to the people that obviously don't like the show for whatever reason and they're  just trying to get to us.  Muffle Voice, you're one of those guys as well.  Yeah, I hate this show.  I listen every day.  No, it's way past that, Bill.  These are guys that are like Howard Stern fans or some other thing is going on.  So Muffle Voice, you're another one.  We've been on to you for a very long time. 
[03:03:30]  Time to change your screen name.  Okay.  Does Muffle Voice know Ace Frehley?  If Muffle Voice knows Ace Frehley.  MV, do you know Ace?  That's all I care about.  How does that song go?  We're back.  Oh, here it is.  But he actually turns to the left.  Then I'll play it.  He rocks back and forth.  Ace is always high.  He's like, we're back in the New York groove.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He doesn't care.  No.  Shot me.  He's the fucking greatest.  I'm obsessed with Ace Frehley, dude.  All right, here's Jimmy doing back in the New York groove. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, it's for the drums.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  Welcome back to the OVNF E show.  My favorite.  You know what's great about that, Bill? 
[03:04:30]  There was a drum set set up over there, and that's Jimmy playing.  That's Jimmy on the drums.  That was Carmine Apice's drum from the Vanilla Fudge was playing on the Radio Chick show,  and his drum set was there.  How friggin' funny is that?  There's something about that.  I could hear that all day long over and over again.  That's Jimmy actually like the...  You know what it is?  It's timeless.  You don't know if it happened during ragtime or recently. 
[03:05:00]  It really is.  Wow, yeah.  Transcends any era.  Yeah, the joy in his voice.  Maybe the gay 90s.  1892, I'll go with that.  The gay 90s.  There's a great part in New York groove where Ace kind of talks things,  which is basically through all that.  And he goes, here I am again, back in the city.  And just to see him doing that live, oh, it's the fucking...  You want to hug him.  Well, he's not a singer.  No!  No!  Ace, he didn't give a shit that he wants to.  No, he didn't care.  He didn't try to fucking fake it. 
[03:05:30]  He didn't fucking kiss.  Jimmy, I wanted to interrupt you, but that's another problem some of the listeners have,  and I had Ace Frehley on the phone, supposedly, and he hung up.  Well, maybe he's saying.  So maybe Ace Frehley could call back.  That would be great.  Where's Ace?  Supposedly, people are...  Whoever answered the phone, oh boy.  Who's answering the phone?  Bon Jovi.  Oh, boy.  Why is Bon Jovi answering the phone?  It was a fake Ace Frehley, because it said this guy claiming to be Ace Frehley.  Of course it was fake.  Yeah, that one would have been fun, listening to the guy pretend that's true.  Maybe it was Ace Frehley.  All right, let's say again...  It was Bon Jovi, though.  He's a rock star.  I'm fucking...  Not that one.  I'm fucking pissed, by the way, because... 
[03:06:00]  I'm turning off phones.  The Bret Michaels interview was great, and we had Ace Frehley...  Oh, Ace Frehley, sorry.  Where's Ace Frehley open?  Is he in the dressing room?  Is this part of my birthday surprise?  Oh, you're some dumbass, man.  Bring me Ace.  I'm pissed, because we had Chris Hansen on hold.  Who is he?  And he was ready to go, and our interview with Bret Michaels went long, because we wanted to go long.  And now Chris Hansen's got to, like, reschedule.  Oh.  Did he hear Ace Frehley come in the door?  Did he hear what happened with Chris Hansen? 
[03:06:30]  No.  Oh, can you get that clip?  Did somebody finally attack him?  Oh, that's a good one.  No.  No, don't even tell Bill.  Don't even tell him.  He was doing the thing, and a guy walked in thinking it was a young girl.  It was Chris Hansen.  And he goes, he goes, were you here for sex?  And the guy's like, no.  And he goes, well, all right.  But the weird part of this interview was, Chris Hansen actually had a kid there, and the guy fucked the kid, and Chris went, good job.  And then he left.  It was really weird.  What episode was that one? 
[03:07:00]  The Lost Episode.  It's on the DVD.  Under extras.  He just keeps going.  He didn't stop.  You think I don't know?  That was spiraling into just dullery and nothingness.  I didn't care.  Why?  Because someone was looking for something.  I didn't care.  I didn't care.  There's a lot of rumors around that were suggesting that you kidnap Ace Frehley.  I don't kidnap Ace Frehley.  Why don't you take a seat?  I want Ace to come in and talk to me.  Well, it says here you wanted to fuck her in the ass.  Enjoying the lemonade? 
[03:07:30]  Why don't you take a seat over there?  No, no, no.  Take a seat right over there.  Over there.  What are you doing here?  I thought the house was for sale.  You thought the house was for sale?  He's got to repeat it.  You thought the house was for sale?  Like, everything he says is stupid.  So it's like he walks in and he goes, what are you doing here?  I was hot.  I took my clothes off.  You were hot and took your clothes off then.  Yes.  Why don't you have some lemonade?  Now, are you here to have sex?  No, no.  I thought...  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw the garage door was open, and I was just concerned. 
[03:08:00]  I was just concerned that someone was going to steal a weed whacker.  So you saw the garage door open, and we're concerned that somebody was going to steal  a weed whacker.  Yeah.  Am I in some sort of trouble here?  Are you in some sort of trouble?  Yeah, I guess I am, aren't I?  I love that.  He does.  He does.  He repeats what they say.  I love it.  You know what I love?  They go, what the fuck is this guy doing?  I like how the white-collar pedophiles know enough to immediately shut the fuck up, leave,  and ask for a lawyer.  Lawyer up.  But the dirtbag fucking, you know, the average blue-collar or a fucking guy off the street 
[03:08:30]  who has a laptop somehow.  He don't know.  Yeah, he's just like...  Why don't you tell me what you're doing here?  Why did you come here?  I was going to try to fuck a two-year-old and her five-year-old brother.  I guess I'm in trouble, aren't I?  How great would it be if the cameraman's doing the gig, so he knows where the house  is, and he has a guy he doesn't like, and he goes fucking, like, he emails a guy, and 
[03:09:00]  he goes, meet this hot chick here, so the guy shows up at the house all fucking ready,  he walks in thinking this is an adult.  Oh, that would be brutal.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Good way to play a trick on a friend in the neighborhood.  Dude, I don't know if you noticed, that's like, that is the next, like, hack topic to have  as a comedian.  I was just joking.  No, no, no, no, no.  I was only joking.  I mean, that topic of To Catch a Predator, I went down the cellar and I did it.  I had, like, four or five other comics just go, like, dude, I basically have that exact  bit, had to end up dropping the thing. 
[03:09:30]  It was so much fun to do.  Yeah, I know.  So many people, though.  It's like, it's popular culture.  So here it is.  We don't want to tell you what happened.  Bill, I want to get your reactions.  Okay, the anticipation.  This was a recent To Catch a Predator with Chris Hansen, who has to reschedule, because  we want to, we kind of wanted to talk about this today.  He asked you a schedule.  What, did you dose them?  What?  Did you dose them?  No.  They're really good.  I had them before. 
[03:10:00]  Did you bring the snook?  Can I just roll it up wherever?  Yeah.  Let's check it out.  Go check it out.  He wants the decoy to smell the marijuana he brought.  Smells good.  All right, I'm just going to go get something to drink while you finish that up, okay?  You want something?  It seems something about that line gets this man thinking.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  That's key.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  All right, that's key. 
[03:10:30]  Perhaps he's heard it before.  That's the setup.  You ready?  Love him.  Are you ready, Bill?  Okay.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands right where I can see them.  All right.  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  What was your plan tonight?  Plan tonight?  Come down, you know?  Come down.  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  Come down.  You're Chris Anson?  I am.  Have you seen this show? 
[03:11:00]  You have, too.  I thought you were real funny on Opium Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opium Anthony.  Can I honestly tell you something?  Yeah, please.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this to happen.  No fucking, no way.  No way.  Yeah, that's one of our fans.  We've made it in pop culture, man.  What a proud day for us all.  What a plug.  What a plug.  That'll help the merger.  No fucking way. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, you heard me on Opium Anthony.  And we got this voicemail overnight.  That happened.  And then all our phones fucking went nuts, right?  And Doug Stanhope called from in the middle of a desert somewhere on the Mexican border with this.  Steven, it's Douglas Stanhope.  We're drinking wine at the border here.  And, oh, my God.  Some to catch a predator guy just mentioned ONA.  And so you've had this fucking Chris Matthews fucking entrapment connoisseur as a fucking guest. 
[03:12:00]  And this guy knows him from you guys.  Oh, I want to.  I would like a fight.  That's such a dog shit program.  We baited long before perverted justice.  Fucking baited.  I'll talk to you on the air or on the phone. 
[03:12:30]  It's dog shit.  It's bull shit.  You act like this.  Ah.  I won't talk now.  I'll save it.  End of message.  All right.  You know, what's going on with our staff?  Why can't we have all the curses?  We're over here at XM now.  That's the only version I had was from this.  Oh, this should be an unbelief version.  Yeah, but this should be an unbelief version.  It came in unbelief.  It should be automatic that we just record, you know, get it on disc.  All right.  I'll get it.  I'm not blaming you, Eron. 
[03:13:00]  I am.  All right.  I'll get it.  Why wasn't it?  Well, he's the only one in the room.  I mean, why don't we have, like, the unbelief version of that?  I mean, we're acting like a bunch of blank holes.  Right.  Hey, how stupid does that sound on XM?  So we were going to have Chris Hansen on to talk about that.  Chris Hansen.  Fucking Andy Walker didn't get us an updated fucking version.  Some pot.  What is that you got there?  Some pot.  Some pot.  Yeah, I was just going to, you know, see if you like the smell of it.  Like the smell of it.  If you listen to that clip.  Now, the punchline there was the fact that the guy listened to the show. 
[03:13:30]  But listen to when Chris Hansen, if we could play that again, because he does repeat  what the guy says.  It's a great little tactic.  And someone's saying that's a classic police interrogation tactic.  And it's got to be pointed out.  First time I've ever seen Bill Burr.  Shocked.  Your mouth went.  It was like, oh, my God.  Your mouth went agape.  It's one of yours.  Like, oh, my God.  Dude, there's just nothing funny about fucking a kid.  Oh, you understand that.  I'm just like, it's one of ours.  There you go.  That doesn't have to be said.  Trust me. 
[03:14:00]  We didn't know what.  We're like, oh.  No, it just really made me think, like, at any given moment, there's, like, a pedophile  learning about whales on the Discovery Channel.  Right.  Exactly.  They watch TV, too.  They listen.  They're just like us.  They listen to the radio.  They listen to the show.  Except for that one little tick.  Bill, you've had pedophiles in your audience.  I know.  That's what it comes down to, okay?  Do you ever wonder if you've ever, like, sat next to or talked to, like, a serial killer?  Oh, yeah.  I think shit like that all the time.  Absolutely.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  Like in a diner, he just finished murdering, like, three people, he was getting pigs in 
[03:14:30]  a blanket.  And you're like, hey, dude, do you mind if I get the ketchup?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they don't have it.  Your hand touches.  It just murdered somebody.  I'm just hoping when you die, like, God, like, sits you down and goes, wow, remember  when you were 18 and you decided not to get in that car?  Well, that, you know, this was going to happen to you.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  This is how many times I saved your ass.  Right.  Or you were sitting next to a serial killer in that diner, but at the moment that he was going  to kind of make his move, you decide you need to take a leak, and he got nervous at  that point and left him, moved on to another victim. 
[03:15:00]  Like, I would love to know how close I was to some fucked up shit.  God is too busy to do that.  Here's what God would do.  God would walk up and go, you know the poem Footprints?  He'd go, yeah.  He'd go, know it.  Learn it.  That's what God does.  And by the way, Bill, not only has a pedophile been in your show, but there's been somebody  who has listened to your CD and enjoyed it.  Why are you going to ruin it?  And say, this guy is great, and then turned the thing off, and said, I got to go inside  now and molest my daughter.  Oh, shit. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, wow.  Someone has laughed at your joke, and this guy is fucking hilarious.  Oh, wow.  Yep.  I got to get in there, though, because she's five, and she's been sleeping for a while.  I got to destroy a young person's life after listening to your chuckles.  Not inspired by your CD.  But I mean, it is the juxtaposition of us as entertainers with the public, some great  fans.  That's right.  And occasionally the one, I know, guys, occasionally the one who will enjoy your CD, and then go, 
[03:16:00]  God, I have to fuck that kid.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  It happens.  It's what kind of a society we live in.  You just don't know.  So, Chris Hansen talks about the Browdy.  Ah.  Yeah, listen to the repeating.  It's great.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands right where I can see them.  Why would the guy listen?  How about this no?  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  And what was your plan tonight? 
[03:16:30]  Come down, you know?  Talk to her.  Talk to her.  You're Chris Hansen.  Talk to her.  I'm Chris Hansen.  Have you seen this show?  You have to.  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opie and Anthony.  Can I honestly tell you something?  Yeah, please.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this time.  Did you?  Did you really?  I bet you didn't.  The guy was, it would be funny that Chris Hansen's like,  why are you here?  And the guy went, I'm a cunt.  I'm a cunt.  I'm a cunt.  I'm a cunt.  Oh, you got me. 
[03:17:00]  Damn.  Can that listener do a phone-in?  Yeah, where is he?  When they were in prison?  We're trying to find him.  Getting just anally destroyed?  Well, of course, this is when he knew something was up.  No, homo!  One more quick clip.  Using show lines.  How funny would it have been, though, if he said, you be the guy, I'll be Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  So what are you doing here?  Just here to meet the girl.  Oh, to meet the girl.  Yeah, I thought, you know, I'd see what she was doing. 
[03:17:30]  We chatted.  Chatted.  Yeah, I thought you were really funny on the Opie and Anthony show.  Baba Booey.  That wasn't a particularly good impression of Chris Hansen.  It was the great Karnak.  Bloody diapers and a brownie.  I like that Jim couldn't do the voice, but he thought if he crossed his hands like this, 
[03:18:00]  that it would be good.  He's going to get his essence.  Jim captures the essence.  May Chris Hansen abuse you with a broom handle.  Here's one last clip from that episode.  What's so funny about the brownies?  Right when I saw the brownies, I knew.  You knew what?  I knew I was going to be running into you.  I think that's the first time we've had brownies.  I'm kind of chuckling about it just because, you know, I shouldn't have.  So you think it's funny?  No, I don't think it's funny. 
[03:18:30]  I mean, it's funny how dumb I'm really turning into.  You're there, Betty.  You've turned.  The journey is complete.  I was just kind of chuckling, and then he's got to bring it all back.  You think it's funny?  Because he knows we're going to play the clip after he says Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Yeah.  He did everything but say richvoss.com.  That's great, man.  Wouldn't it be great if the guy just went with it and he goes, you think it's funny?  Yes.  Yes.  It's hilarious.  Think about it.  And then he just goes, frunkus. 
[03:19:00]  Yes.  You think it's funny?  And then he's sitting there going, frunkus.  Frunkus.  So.  Oh, you're just using the lines for this stuff.  Richvoss.com.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Can we call Voss?  Yeah.  His wife is supposed to have a baby.  Can somebody find out if our friend is having a baby?  By the way.  What's he doing with that baby?  Yeah.  Why can't we get an update?  It was supposed to happen yesterday.  They asked for that hours ago.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, I might be onto him.  I'm not sure.  But I think half a cunt face is now known as Scott Smoke. 
[03:19:30]  Keep a vigilant eye open.  I wanted to hear Jimmy playing the piano and sing.  What?  There's a song that E-Rock just put up there.  It said, Jimmy, also have Jim singing Beth while playing piano.  Oh, is this another time?  This is the B-side.  I'm good.  I don't remember this.  I don't either.  All right.  Let's go.  Beth, I hear you calling.  Oh, yeah.  But I can't come home right now. 
[03:20:00]  Because me and the boys are doing some radio.  And I can't find the sound.  And then he goes, thank you.  Like I said, it's time.  Is that the 1920s?  Was it last week?  Dude.  That could have come right after some, I don't know, some rag time.  Dude.  Sessions presents Timeless Classics by Little Jimmy Norton.  I sang that in a speakeasy.  Jimmy rules.  That could be a YouTube sensation right there. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Make it just slightly longer.  I mean, come on.  Timeless Classics.  Yeah.  And he's like Stevie Wonder.  He can play all instruments.  Yeah.  That's right.  Somebody give me a flute.  I'm going to start fluting.  Zip.  Little skin flute.  Listen, let me set up.  You bag a tug.  Let me set up the last 15 minutes of the show.  Ooh.  Because we're going to take a break.  We've got to find out what this is.  Oh, I forgot.  Yeah.  Mystery sound. 
[03:21:00]  Just lost in space.  It's like a chimp.  All right.  We're going to find out what that is after the break.  We're going to do some line of the day.  I think I know what it is.  Oh. 
[03:21:30]  It's a man reflavoring marmalade.  Reflavor marmalade.  Exactly.  It sounds like that.  Oh.  That's why I've never heard it before.  Dog barks.  Dogs always bark during a good marmalade reflavoring.  Who doesn't know that?  Right after the break.  I have a lot of good guesses.  I bet you do.  What else?  That's somebody spinning in a circle while mumbling racist epithets. 
[03:22:00]  I'm telling you.  I don't think so.  It is.  Racial epithets.  Mumbling.  We're also.  Also.  Got audio.  Audio.  There was a listing for a sexual assault hotline.  Hotline.  So you call this if you've been sexually assaulted.  Sexually assaulted.  And the phone connects you with a phone sex operator.  Phone sex operator.  Did you hear what he just said? 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Good.  Actually he wasn't.  I was just kind of listening to you.  Yeah.  It's one of those things.  I'm sure he isn't listening either when these people are talking.  He's just like, you're so screwed.  And we go to break with Norton doing another little ditty.  No way.  I remember when he commented over Hurt.  Oh, right.  Okay.  One of the greatest cover songs of all time.  Johnny Cash doing.  Might be the greatest ever.  Yeah.  You're not going to get an argument from me.  You will from the people though, Jimmy.  No, I won't.  It could start a whole hour of radio. 
[03:23:00]  I hated that cover.  Oh, no.  I hurt myself today.  Yeah.  Well, this is what Jimmy had to say as we were trying to play Johnny Cash's version  of Hurt.  I know what that sound is, by the way.  What?  It's a man shooing an invalid.  Shoo them?  Yes.  You just hammer it right into their dumb feet because they can't feel nothing, no  how.  Here you go.  Fucking turnip legs.  Now beat it.  My shoes don't come off.  Shut up, you fucking burden. 
[03:23:30]  Go sit in the corner like you normally do.  Fucking collapsible leg.  Silly goose.  Take your fucking folding tent legs and hit the bricks.  I'll take those fucking nurse shoes and I nailed them right to your dumb feet.  You can't even get naked.  You have to fucking bathe with your asshole in the tub and your legs hanging out of it  so your tootsies don't get wet.  What's better than shooing an invalid?  He can't even kick at you.  He can't, he's trying to punch his leg to get some kind of a fucking, like a reaction 
[03:24:00]  from his legs to kick out.  He doesn't want to be shooed.  It's embarrassing.  Because you nailed the shoe on all crooked.  It's all askew.  It looks silly.  Holy shit.  Shut your face, fucking spaghetti feet.  Atrophy, dumb legs.  What's better than that?  Fucking guy in a chair with pencil thin legs.  Because they have no muscles.  They don't get a workout. 
[03:24:30]  Guess your fucking, he's got, he's got arms like fucking, like, like, like Roger Clemens.  Fucking, hey, hey, asparagus legs, I need to talk to you.  All right, let me wheel over with my extra strong and dirty hands.  Because I'm always wheeling after I just rolled through shit.  And then I put my hand in it and I go, varoom, varoom. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, phone cord legs, you got a second?  Hey, doll feet, get over here.  I do have doll feet.  You've shooed me.  To shoo an invalid.  Holy shit.  My fucking size hurts.  What's better than that?  When you twist his foot really hard and he has to just look at it and know that it should hurt?  How come I'm not reacting?  I don't know. 
[03:25:30]  How does this feel?  Half a person?  How does that feel?  Fucking.  I didn't know he was a slam poet.  Hey, eggs, Benedict knees.  I want to talk to you for a second.  Dumb dangling feet.  I initially thought you meant shoo them like shoo them away.  No, you shoo them away.  You were literally like you would a horse. 
[03:26:00]  No, you grab their leg.  You wrap your whole hand around their fucking thigh.  Your fingers touch when you wrap it around their wafer-thin thighs.  Big, big, gigantic upper fucking body.  And just below.  They just taper like they're being sucked into a black hole.  And you give them a good shooing whether they like it or not.  Just a couple of dangling twizzlers.  They just look like, what do they look like?  Just two pieces of spaghetti with a lima bean on them. 
[03:26:30]  That would be the feast.  Just swing them back and forth and watch how they don't stop swinging until the wind says  it's time to.  Oh, my God.  We cancel line of the day today.  Oh, God.  Just cancel it.  It's over, Johnny.  Rant of the day.  Evil man.  I love him.  It won't do line of the day justice.  You just heard it.  Somewhere in there.  Just keep it like that.  Spoke to Voss.  Nothing to report.  Bonnie goes back into the hospital on Monday. 
[03:27:00]  No baby yet.  Monday.  For the Vosses.  It was supposed to happen this past Monday.  It's a week late.  A couple days ago, yeah.  It's in our 11th month.  We're not really going to take a break.  We're just going to re-listen to Norton commenting during Hurt, and then we'll do something something,  and then we'll get out of here.  How's that sound?  Goody good.  Can we get a taste of Johnny Cash doing Hurt?  This song is deeply depressing.  I hurt myself.  Here he goes.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash. 
[03:27:30]  I should have had Joaquin Phoenix sing this.  I hurt myself today.  I hurt myself today.  Did ya?  To see if I still feel.  Well, do ya?  I focus on the pain.  Did ya?  The only thing that's real.  Is it?  The needle tears a hole. 
[03:28:00]  Does it?  The old familiar sting.  Is it?  Try to kill it all away.  Do ya?  But I remember everything.  Do ya?  What have I become?  Of all my sweetest friends. 
[03:28:30]  Everyone I know goes away in the air.  Do they?  All right, we get it.  That is all it is.  Yeah, could I?  Eric, what were you saying to me off air, buddy?  I could not hear you.  Yeah, what were we...  Hold on.  Eddie!  Why did he rock?  Dandy.  It was just one of Jimmy's lines I thought was really... 
[03:29:00]  I didn't know you said something about a shoe.  What line?  He said, hey, turn up legs, come here.  And the guy's saying, I can't, my shoes don't come off.  Thank you.  You know what you are?  He's the fucking spick and span of humor.  He just comes in and cleans a line fucking...  Like a buzzard.  Of all funniness.  You're the humor buzzard.  Wow.  There's fucking meat on a line.  He comes in there and he picks all the humor right off it.  You couldn't have made that less funny. 
[03:29:30]  I...  I'm stunned.  Hi, fly ball.  It's the left foot of the floor.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I thought, sure, he was unable to reach it.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Now, why don't we just go home?  Thanks, E-Rock.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking...  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:30:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  I'll never say a line again.  I have a little crushed brain.  That's why they call me Dandy Walker.  Toss let rain.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[03:30:30]  Are you sulking?  Good thing he can hide behind those monitors.  Jim Norton, we'll be signing books at the Barnes & Noble in Long Island on Old Country Road tomorrow at 7.30 in Carl Pace.  Toss let rain.  Toss let rain.  Anyone who has old ventriloquist doll legs need not come.  Toss let rain.  Fucking just twist those feet around six or seven times.  And you know what you do?  You watch them just like unwrap themselves.  And the one shoe comes normal and the other one just is still pointing backwards as his leg still has a half a twist in it. 
[03:31:00]  That's right.  Reach down and do it with your hand.  Fucking you no baton passing bag of shit.  Fucking one pair of sneakers all through high school, motherfucker.  Oh, wow.  It's pure evil.  It's pure evil.  Hey, perfect treads.  I'm talking to you.  Brand new souls. 
[03:31:30]  Brand new souls.  Hey, never stepped in shit.  Get over here for a second.  Hey, eat off your shoes.  That is so evil.  So funny.  Just cut him off.  Fucking one last one last thing to do.  Years.  Okay.  One eight six six. 
[03:32:00]  This was the call Karen Carter's daughter made Sunday night.  She starts getting this horrible look on her face.  Scared.  So Carter listened herself.  I had to be dialing the wrong number.  Hey there, hot stuff.  I've been waiting for your call.  Somehow, the phone book and the attorney general's website had a phone number for a sex hotline.  North Central Florida Sexual Assault Center.  But the listing said it was for the North Central Florida Sexual Assault Center.  A mistake would have been how to repair your car or something. 
[03:32:30]  I mean, this was a number that was, you know, specifically for pornographic purposes.  I mean, it was the opposite of what you were calling about.  Wow.  Somebody thought it would be a funny joke.  Yeah.  And apparently, it wasn't.  From my understanding, that operation has been shut down for about four to five months now.  Again, it's been very unfortunate that they were the type of business to purchase that number. 
[03:33:00]  So how does it take so long to realize the mistake?  That's something we're looking into to find out what the delay was.  Again, you know, we're in the way it's a new administration, so we've been methodically going through our website.  The number was taken off the website after WCJB contacted the Attorney General's office.  And I'm getting this, this sex.  But dialing still leads girls like Karen Carter's daughter to a sex hotline.  And I convinced my daughter that this phone call was going to help her.  And it just made things immensely worse. 
[03:33:30]  Could they at least get the people off the street when they talk about the worst moment of their life?  Yeah.  Get them inside so we get good acoustics.  By the way, Tom in Philly writes, I don't think we're not much there, but Tom in Philly writes, there, he did it.  Bill always says how he leaves feeling dirty walking in the streets.  He said, hey, he was clean until the perfect treads line.  Enjoy your insomnia, William.  You had to chime in. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, I chime in.  You're going to see that fine song.  You get caught up in the moment because it's so much fun to listen to.  Brilliant rant.  Yes.  Had to jump into it.  It's very funny.  And you get caught up.  You want to be part of it.  You know what you want to do?  I have a need to be liked.  I don't know.  I just want to be accepted by the group.  Yeah.  You know what you do to an invalid like that?  You fucking walk over and you, hey, I'm talking to you.  And you punch him really hard in the thigh.  And you watch him get angry because he saw you do it. 
[03:34:30]  But if he was sleeping, he never would have known.  Well, you fucking take his shoes off.  Like, you ever see Scared Straight?  How they take the guy's shoes off and you throw him like between, like you reach into the chair.  You take his shoe off and you throw it back between.  And you start bending his foot back and forth.  The way you would a plastic spoon.  And you fucking lecture him.  I used to talk to my girlfriend years ago about that.  There's not a look of pain in his face.  Oh, my God.  Many years ago, the girl I dated, she had a fucking, one of those, that's where I got turnip legs from.  Because she had a guy in her fucking family that just had these awful, atrophied fucking, atrophied fucking stems. 
[03:35:00]  And I used to always talk to my girlfriend.  I said, I want to, I think it might have been a woman, actually.  I said, I want to fucking straighten her feet out on the chair.  But I would wheel her over.  And when company was coming over, I'd take her feet and then jam them onto the footstool and make them straight and then scold her.  Because they would keep, like, folding in.  Folding back in and pointing at each other.  As if to say, can you feel anything? 
[03:35:30]  Because I can't.  Yeah, you can hear the two big toes going, psst, are you as useless as I am?  Old wicked witch under the house feet.  Curl up.  Oh, I forgot about that.  They curled up under the house.  The anger at not being able to make the feet straight because company was coming over.  That's why they make them wear blankets over their legs.  It's embarrassing to the family.  Down power line legs.  Just flopping around, no good to no one. 
[03:36:00]  Oh.  Wow.  I think that's a good place to end this.  Jimmy Norton.  We're not going to do any better than that.  Ladies and gentlemen, happy endings.  On sale.  Yeah, tomorrow night.  By the way, we found the MySpace of that guy that got caught on to catch a predator.  He's got a MySpace?  And supposedly it has some great stuff on there, like...  Is he a fan of the show?  This is a quote from his MySpace.  Just get a unicycle.  It's the pedophile's Corvette.  Now, who would say something?  Is this real? 
[03:36:30]  This is really his MySpace account?  That's what I was given.  Come on.  No way.  Come on.  Wouldn't you...  If you were busted, wouldn't you just clear all that out?  Like, wouldn't you do a mass cleaning of your MySpace page?  Wait.  But there's a video of Jimmy.  Is that a Jim Norton video?  No.  Right there.  Jim's like, no.  Right there.  Not a part of this on any level.  That's Fez.  That's Fez?  Oh, it's Fez.  Okay, then now it makes sense.  Please tell me this guy's one of those message board people.  Oh, that'd be great. 
[03:37:00]  Who I'd like to meet?  Matt Damon, Ron Bennington, Mike Rowe, Fez, Watley, Eastside Dave, Bill Burr.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Tom Cruise, Bruce Lee, Jason Kidd, Martin Scorsese.  Any...  And James Gumm.  Any women?  No.  Any pictures of that kid from I See Dead People?  Is this where...  Yeah, this is the kid.  Haley Joel. 
[03:37:30]  Haley Joel.  Oh, that's him.  That's definitely him.  Write down his name for me.  Can you do that?  Right.  And...  I'm going to find out who he is.  The needle tears a hole.  The only thing that's real.  What are you doing?  Looking at his photos.  Oh, okay.  Oh, looking at his photos.  What's he got?  Uh-oh.  What's he got here?  Let's see.  What's he got?  Do I see a kid?  The face of a pedophile.  Oh, Jesus.  He has sexual predator facial hair.  Yeah.  In that first picture.  Oh, boy.  He's got a Red Sox jersey on. 
[03:38:00]  Bill?  How do I know this guy's a hater?  I just can fucking smell it.  Can you?  Yep.  You can smell it?  Oh, please, God, let him be someone that doesn't like me.  Please let him be going to jail for kid-touching.  Oh.  Would that please me?  All right.  He's going to have to resign as president of the Dakota Fanning Fan Club.  No, he won't.  He should be reinstated immediately.  He's sincere.  Dakota Fan Club.  You're going to have to resign.  Yes.  Resign.  Resign.  Yeah.

Ace is a fan of this show?  No.  That was Ace.  That wasn't Ace.  Hi, Ace.  We're going home.  Ace, hi.  What the hell is that?  Clip from Martin.  What is this guy, a lunatic?  What was this?  Got a clip of, like... 
[03:39:00]  Oh, I'm in his top eight.  All right, you made his top eight.  You said Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly's there, yeah.  Dave Attell.  Anthony.  I am.  Ron and Fez show.  Ron and Fez.  I'm not there.  I'm in the clear.  Anthony is.  Oh, my God.  Great.  And little Amanda.  Little Amanda.  Where's little Amanda?  Oh, my God.  Does he have a kid?  Well...  I can't read that one.  Amber Albert.  Uh-huh.  No?  Maybe.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  Not that up to date on...  All right.  ...that.  Bill, you're going to be in Pittsburgh.  Yes, I am.  Great job today, by the way, buddy.  August 12th.  Thank you.  August 12th?  That weekend?  That weekend, yeah.  At the Improv in Pittsburgh?  Yes, in Pittsburgh.  Want to make sure.  And BillBurr.com?  Yep.  BillBurr.com.  Pedophiles are not welcomed.  Oh, stop being such a...  An elitist.  Why don't you tell me what's on BillBurr.com?  Why don't you tell everybody what's on there?  Well, I mean, I got some photos up there. 
[03:40:00]  Photos?  Yeah.  I got a...  Yeah.  I have a message board and...  Message board?  Yeah, you have to sign in.  Sign in.  I just wanted to know if, like, the internet was for sale or anything.  For sale?  Yeah.  You're here for sex.  Your website is for sex with young children.  I guess I'm in a lot of trouble, aren't I?  Yes, you are, but you're free to go to the police, the five police that are going to grind  their knees into your neck. 
[03:40:30]  I know.  I could just leave?  You haven't seen the show, have you?  Now comes the fun part.  This is like the part where Alan Funt used to come out and say, smile your uncandid camera,  except police officers thrust their knees into the back of your neck, and then you're  taken away, embarrassing family, friends, losing your job.  Happy?  Have a brownie.  Some lemonade.  My favorite one was that doctor.  Did you ever see the doctor?  Oh, God.  Where he threw his beeper, his cell phone down. 
[03:41:00]  His sunglasses.  He took them off of his head, and he just goes, God damn it.  I'm in so much trouble now.  You don't understand.  I'm starting to cry.  Yeah.  What about the...  Do you see the rabbi literally having a nervous breakdown?  Just going like...  The only way to have your diaphragm move the way his was, was to be caught trying to fuck  a child on camera.  You can't breathe like that.  It was...  It was...  I've never seen it, and he's just like... 
[03:41:30]  He was so distraught, I almost felt bad for him, because I kept forgetting that he was  there to, you know...  I think pedophiles use, like, children's testicles, like those stress balls.  Oh.  Just sort of hold them.  Just kind of...  Hold them.  Yeah, that's all they're doing.  Yeah.  I have stress.  You're here to relieve stress.  Yeah, I have...  Captain Quick.  I have...  I just have a lot of stress, and I'm just trying to relieve it.  Relieve stress.  Yeah, but that's it.  I just want to make sure the person was okay. 
[03:42:00]  With a young person's private areas.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I guess I'm a bit...  Have some lemonade and step outside.  Our SWAT team will come down on your head like you just robbed a thing.  Oh, pedophiles.  All right.  All right, let's wrap up.  We got a movie to go to.  You going, Jimmy?  No, I'm going to go to therapy.  All right.  Therapy.  I can't be missing therapy.  A bunch of us are going to go see the Simpsons movie. 
[03:42:30]  I got to go to therapy.  Is that one of those cartoons?  A little cartoon action.  A cartoon.  It's about OJ and Nicole.  Oh, wow.  All those wacky Simpsons.  White bitch.  Let's go.  All right.  Later.  See you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison, and you are listening to the one, the only, magnificent,  my pal, Lil Jimmy Norton.
