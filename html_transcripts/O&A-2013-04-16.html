<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a visceral discussion of the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing.  The hosts provided graphic descriptions of injuries sustained in the attacks, speculating on the perpetrators and the nature of the explosives used. They criticized President Obama's address as generic and noted Boston's mayor's absence due to illness.  A caller, Kevin from Boston, described his harrowing experience near the second explosion. The hosts debated the role of social media and police scanners in disseminating information, comparing citizen reporting speed to that of traditional media.  Buck Sexton, a former NYPD Intelligence Division member, joined the show, offering expert insight into investigative methods, focusing on bomb signatures and digital evidence. He discussed the challenges of preventing such attacks and the potential for disinformation.  The hosts and Sexton criticized the media's focus on sensational details, like the youngest victim's injuries and the picture of a man on a roof, mentioning a Saudi man as a person of interest. The discussion was punctuated by strong language throughout.

The show continued by exploring the proliferation of conspiracy theories surrounding the bombing, particularly those propagated by Alex Jones.  They played and ridiculed a video of Jones speculating on government involvement, satirizing his style and production quality. Buck Sexton remained a guest, emphasizing the importance of focusing on apprehending the perpetrators rather than overreacting with increased security measures.  The hosts expressed their contempt for conspiracy theorists and their "false flag" narratives.  Jim Norton then joined the show, engaging in a vulgar conversation about anal hygiene, followed by Jim Brewer recounting a similarly graphic anecdote about cleaning up after his father.  Further discussion included the Boston Bruins' game postponement, the Westboro Baptist Church's potential protest, and the appropriate music selection for the show in light of the tragedy.  A brief conversation with Dennis Falcone about programming choices followed, along with commentary on a vacationing colleague's bikini photos.  The segment was replete with crude and offensive language.

The next segment began with the hosts discussing the Red Sox game cancellation, then veered into a Rocky movie clip discussion, followed by a debate on their favorite films in the franchise. This transitioned into a comedic challenge for Dennis Falcone, in studio, to select a song appropriate for the somber mood.  The ensuing banter was filled with profanity as numerous suggestions (and listener suggestions) were rejected due to lyrical content or potential misinterpretation.  Ultimately, "Dirty Water" by The Standells was chosen.  The show then featured jokes about a photo of comedian Scorch performing to a nearly empty audience.  The segment concluded with a discussion of an upcoming Rob Zombie interview, with Tom Papa (also in studio) providing insights into Zombie's personality and home.  The hosts used the upcoming GoToMeeting as a springboard for comedic commentary about their disdain for corporate interactions.  The show ended with the playing of "Dirty Water" and continued humorous commentary, including a bit about their avoidance of professional interaction.


The show then focused on a blogger, "Lady Trucker," who had criticized Jim Norton.  The hosts and a caller discussed her blog posts and tweets, which contained racist remarks and other offensive language. The hosts defended Norton, highlighting the blogger's hypocrisy in playing the victim after her own attacks.  They debated the appropriateness of online attacks, especially those threatening violence, focusing on her inflammatory language, including the phrase "salty wetback," and her lack of self-awareness.  They also mentioned potentially inviting Lady Trucker onto the show.  Tom Papa and Rob Zombie then joined as guests.  The conversation shifted to Papa's comedy shows and Zombie's new movie and album, touching on promotional challenges, Zombie's elaborate stage show, special effects (including an iPhone app), and the difficulties of working in New York City.  They also discussed Words with Friends, Zombie's collecting habits, and live performance experiences, including dealing with cell phone usage by the audience.  The conversation included references to other musicians and comedians and was marked by frequent crude language.  A caller, Eric from Colorado, mentioned Ronnie and Fez's opinions on Louis C.K., and another listener commented on Fez's past offensive material.  The segment concluded with discussions about the challenges of maintaining audience appeal and Zombie's upcoming tour.


A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a conversation with Rob Zombie.  The discussion covered his career, the anxieties of maintaining success, changes in the music industry, and adapting a true story ("Broad Street Bullies") into a film script.  Zombie discussed his relentless work schedule, the financial pitfalls for musicians, and the different career stages, including the possibility of mid-career slumps. He shared anecdotes about other musicians, comparing his career to David Lee Roth's and discussing the aging process of musicians.  Listener calls were featured, including one about a negative encounter with Scott Ian of Anthrax and another about a bad experience with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe. The hosts and callers shared various experiences meeting celebrities, both positive and negative.  Highlights included a caller revealing a Rob Zombie tattoo, discussions about the sexual content of Zombie's films, and humorous banter about Zombie’s perceived difficulty as an interview subject. The changing landscape of music consumption was also discussed, comparing physical and digital media.  Offensive language was frequently used throughout this segment.

The final segment was a chaotic and vulgar discussion touching on several subjects.  Whoopi Goldberg's (Who Kid's) interactions with other celebrities formed a recurring theme, with anecdotes about negative encounters with Adam Carolla and Allen Houston, contrasting with positive interactions with Rob Zombie and Sam Roberts.  The conversation frequently veered into crude humor, including explicit sexual references and jokes about defecation.  A significant portion focused on a Dollar Shave Club advertisement, with humorous commentary on shaving practices and razor costs. A caller shared a story about a reportedly drunk and rude encounter with Tim Allen.  "Racist Francesa," a caller, shared his opinions on celebrities, praising Sam Roberts and criticizing Dan Harron. A running gag involved a banana, culminating in Roland destroying it. The show concluded with a Mother's Day advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers and a promotion for Who Kid's upcoming Willie Nelson birthday party featuring various musicians, including Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg. Alan Thicke Jr., the intern, was repeatedly referenced and involved in humorous bits, including a discussion about his girlfriend and his reactions to the previous broadcast about his relationship.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, good morning. 
[00:04:30]  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  I guess you just start with a good morning, right?  That's usually the way, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  So, what do we know?  Do we know anything else?  Nothing new overnight?  Nah, nothing new.  They search some apartment in Revere.  Got some Saudi guy. 
[00:05:00]  Was it Revere or Hull?  Revere.  Oh.  Got some Saudi guy in the hospital.  They've called him many things.  Person of interest.  Right.  Person of interest.  They're questioning.  Right.  They're questioning.  But, yeah.  Everyone's speculating.  A lot of speculating.  Speculating, speculating, speculating.  Everyone's just trying to figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  I'm surprised no one has really claimed responsibility yet. 
[00:05:30]  Well, not yet.  There are people.  The fucking Pakistani Taliban has said, hey, we got nothing to do with it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They were smelling drone attack on them.  Oh, really?  They're like, hey, hey.  Whoa.  Hello.  Nothing to do with this one.  Nothing to see here.  Move along, please.  I think it was a lone person or a people.  Because it's just, it didn't seem like they were very effective.  I mean, effective.  But they weren't as sophisticated a bomb, it seems. 
[00:06:00]  Lone Wolf?  Yeah.  Or a small group.  Well, it's interesting that it happened at the, the video we've all seen a thousand times.  I think, um, I think it said four hours and nine minutes, right?  On the, uh, the finish line clock.  Now.  That's, uh, that's, that's about two hours after the elite runners, you know, finished the race.  Yeah.  So, and I was telling you that before the show, I mean, you know, when the elite runners are coming in, there's a hell, there's so many more people. 
[00:06:30]  And there's VIPs as well.  A lot of politicians and celebrities and, you know, around the four hour mark, you're not going to have as many of those type of people around.  And, uh, this might be a case where the guy just couldn't get, you know, close to the fucking finish line until that point.  At that time.  Mm, perhaps.  I mean, we've been down there a million fucking times.  We've, we've broadcasted from the marathon route.  How would he get two bombs there?  A backpack or whatever.  Everyone's walking around with backpacks because, you know, you got family members in the race. 
[00:07:00]  So, you know, I've seen it here in New York city as well.  People are all walking around with backpacks because, because they got something for their, their family member that's running the race.  So it's one of those days where you do see a lot of backpacks.  That, a bag, you just put it down, put it on a garbage pail, whatever the fuck.  No one's going to think twice about it.  Right.  And, uh.  But it's obviously still very crowded, but, I mean, not as crowded as it would have been around the two hour, two hour and 15 mark.  Yeah, which would lead you to believe he couldn't get in there until, uh, the crowd thinned out and it wasn't planted earlier when, you know, they would sweep in with dogs earlier. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, you know, we're, we're splitting hairs.  When we say thinned out, I mean, there was obviously still a shitload of people there.  But, yeah, but I mean, that's, that's a huge clue that it happened at the four hour and nine minute mark.  I think, I think.  Well, there, uh, like I said, a lot of speculation and speculation.  It was horrible to see all the blood and the carnage.  I mean. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, that was messy.  Holy shit.  You wanted to say that the, the picture of the guy's leg and the bone was fake.  You know how that.  Oh, that was so bad.  You know how that pops up from time to time.  All right.  Obviously that's fake.  No, this time that was fucking real as, uh, as real could be.  That looked like it hurt so much.  Oh my God.  Yikes.  That bone sticking out, like the whole lower, like below the shin bone.  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was fucked up.  That was, that was a brutal photograph.  They, uh, yeah.  Remember we were all looking to see, um, a picture of the basketball player. 
[00:08:30]  What's his name?  Kevin Ware.  Yeah.  Kevin Ware.  And it's like, where's the picture?  And it's like, oh, that one's fake.  That one's Photoshopped.  Right.  Where's the picture of the bone sticking out?  Right, right.  And then we get that.  It's like, oh, okay.  We get a real one.  All right.  That's fucking like horrific.  So, oh my God.  Yeah.  So, um, yeah, it's, you know, it's running the gamut from the, um, crazy right wing extremists  to Al Qaeda.  Right.  And this is the weird time of year too. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  It's anniversary.  It's the anniversary of what?  It was Patriot's day.  It was Patriot's day.  No, I know, but it's also.  Tax day.  Adolf Hitler's fucking birthday.  It's right around the corner of the, uh, the anniversary of the Oklahoma, Oklahoma city  bombing.  Columbine.  Columbine.  It's a, it's a, this is always a weird time of year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if there's a connection there.  Just so happened, you know, uh, they're, they're running the big race on right around  the same time, I guess.  Char.  Yeah.  So, uh, I don't know. 
[00:09:30]  Sean in New York.  I'm a runner.  The four hour time is an hour is average for a lot of people.  No, I understand that, but I mean, you know, you're going to have a lot more people at  the finish line, uh, seeing the, you know, the elite runners.  You're going to have celebrities down there doing their FaceTime, politicians.  Yeah.  Well, believe me, between callers and the Twitter people, Twitter, obviously, uh, playing such  a huge part in, um, news events these days, a lot of people getting to comment and throw 
[00:10:00]  their shit in there and speculate.  Uh, so yesterday I, I catch a tweet that something's going on.  Uh, one of the news alerts on Twitter.  So I turn on the news and I'm like, holy shit, you know, something's going down here in Boston.  And then I go to the, uh, the scanner app on my phone.  Holy fuck.  So it's the best fucking way to get any news to it.  So I turn on, I, I, well, that's what the news people do. 
[00:10:30]  That's probably what the news people do.  Yeah.  But you get it even faster because the news people have to listen.  It's got to go through their side.  Yeah.  Right.  All that shit.  And you know, like right there.  So I was listening and I started, uh, tweeting what I was hearing, but then you get people  like, no asshole, that isn't what they said.  It's like, look, all I'm doing is just hearing it on the scanner and typing it in on Twitter.  Yeah.  You're getting raw info.  Yeah.  So, you know, I was like, oh, cops have just shut down this. 
[00:11:00]  They say there's something going on here or, you know, they say that they're getting bomb  dogs in.  They found two more devices.  Did you promise that the news said that no, the news, I know the news, they're usually  late to the party.  Yeah, exactly.  Did you at least say that you were listening to a police car?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So listen, but you know, people don't want to hear it, but because they were confused  by the library at first, it just happened to be an electrical fire on the same fucking  day.  It was that. 
[00:11:30]  And then they said it was an incendiary fire, which could be a device or that one was, but  it didn't have anything to do with the bombing.  Yeah.  But it was a significant incident over there at the library, right?  On the same fucking day that these two bombs went off and they found other bombs.  How many, how many other bombs?  I think two.  Two more bombs they found.  Two other bombs that they found.  And yeah, they had, they called up like every dog from fucking, from Amtrak, from the airport, 
[00:12:00]  from Logan.  They got like every fucking dog down there.  It's interesting, uh, what I learned yesterday when they get these bombs, they pretty much  know which groups are involved because the groups don't change the way they make their  bombs.  Make the bombs.  They have a way of making their bombs and that's, they usually don't change that, that  often.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  I would think if you're in that business, you're going to fucking change how, how you,  how, you know, what type of bombs you're using.  So what do they found? 
[00:12:30]  That's the first I've heard that.  Oh, they found at least two, right?  And where were those two bombs?  Uh, were they on the, were they on the, the route as well?  I'm not sure actually.  Yeah.  I'm not sure about that.  I don't think they've shown.  I mean, somebody was probably standing there.  They definitely found bombs.  Shearing next to a garbage can with a bomb in it that just didn't go off.  Fuck people.  There's probably people that have no idea how lucky they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe I, I just have a hunch the guy, it was one guy with those two bombs.  He, he drops the first one.  Now he's walking out of the area, drops another one on his way out. 
[00:13:00]  Hmm.  It may be.  Doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it's just one guy involved, but it just feels like  that.  That was the responsibility of, of, of one guy to drop those two.  And maybe he dropped a couple more in like Jimmy saying that didn't go off.  Well, they were scheduled to go off.  Did they remotely?  Well, they'll figure out.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The FBI is so fucking good at this shit.  Yeah.  I mean, they already know stuff that they're not saying.  Of course.  We're way behind. 
[00:13:30]  About how they were made.  Like you said, there's, they call them, uh, signatures.  Right.  You know, people that make bombs, uh, they have certain types of bombs that they, it's  like you're believing a fucking fingerprint.  Right.  Based on how you make it.  So it gives them a very good idea who's involved usually.  Yeah.  And if it's something they haven't seen, then it might be a newer group or someone who  hasn't been around in a while.  Let me say hi to Kevin in Boston.  Kevin.  Oh, Hey, um, right at that time, that four hour mark, the saw, the Red Sox game had just 
[00:14:00]  finished.  And all those people were heading down towards the finish line of the marathon when all that  happened.  Interesting.  Yeah.  I was down, I was right across the street from where the second blast went off only about  probably 20 minutes to a half an hour before, um, before.  So you were in front of the Mandarin hotel?  Uh, I was in front of the Prue.  Oh, are you okay?  Are you okay?  Okay.  Are you okay?  I was there.  I was there five minutes before.  Yeah.  And I was, uh, I was home. 
[00:14:30]  I was in just as much danger as you.  Everybody always tries to do that.  Oh, you know, another anniversary.  I'm looking at our sheet today.  Six years ago was the Virginia tech massacre already.  That's six years.  Oh.  And I always, I always know this time in April is just a weird time.  It's around that Hitler shit.  People are blowing shit up around the, or September.  Huh?  Yeah.  Or September.  So what do you, what do you got to add, Kevin, besides the fact you were close to one of 
[00:15:00]  the, uh, bombs when it went off?  No, I just putting out there that all those people from the Sox game were heading in that  direction.  It was, I mean, you couldn't even get down the sidewalk.  That's how packed it was down there.  Yeah.  We're all just guessing, obviously, but it seems like if you're, if you're targeting the Boston  Marathon, you can try to get to the finish line, you know, in prime time, which is  around that two hour mark, two hour and 15 minute mark.  But I'm just guessing like any other fucking asshole.  I don't know.  I have no fucking idea.  If you think about it, all those people that are down there looking for their families, 
[00:15:30]  obviously most of those families aren't coming in at two hours.  Right.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  So they're probably coming in three, three and a half hours.  Yeah.  But there's, all right.  That's fair enough.  I mean, there's just a lot of, there's a lot of people for most of the day down there.  We all know that.  Absolutely.  And somebody obviously wanted this covered.  Yeah.  They weren't scared that pretty much everyone has a iPhone camera now and all the news crews  are down there and the photographers.  Yeah, the news crews are on the fucking finish line, you know?  Whoever did this didn't give a fuck that they were being, you know, caught dropping bombs 
[00:16:00]  in garbage pails.  Because they will have video of somebody or a picture of somebody.  You see the picture of the guy on the roof?  That could be just a coincidence, though.  That's how the conspiracy shit starts, though.  Speaking of conspiracy shit, holy mother of God.  A picture went around yesterday of a guy just on the roof, but maybe that's just a maintenance  guy that had nothing to do with anything.  Exactly.  But I'm sure, you know.  But they're already blowing that out of proportion.  Yeah.  I've gotten that picture a bunch of times.  Check it out. 
[00:16:30]  Or that picture was interesting.  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Maybe it's just a fucking maintenance guy.  On the roof.  What are you going to do?  So, right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's, uh...  I was thinking it seems very domestic, kind of, you know, bomb shit, but I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm sort of swinging over now to some kind of foreign shit.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  We're domestic being done to connect with a foreign.  Like, uh, it seems like if it's a Saudi guy, it just didn't seem that sophisticated.  Like, it seemed like for all of those people, for two bombs to go off, I mean, more people  might die, but luckily only three people are dead.  I mean, that could have been hundreds of people dead.  Well, if those other two bombs went off, and I wonder where those two bombs were supposed  to go off.  Well, that's just it, too.  It's very difficult.  Um, the police usually do a good job of making sure, if someone came in with something big  enough to do that big of a, uh, much damage. 
[00:17:30]  And then it's like, well, then he would use C4.  It's like, they've caught people trying to make bombs with C4, because there's a paper  trail, and a trail, when you're trying to buy C4 and bring it into the country, it's  not that easy to do without setting off some red flags, you know?  Right.  So it's either got to be a very big bomb with conventional explosives, or something smaller  with explosives that are going to kind of ring a bell on the FBI and anti-terrorism.  So, I mean, they did a lot of fucking damage. 
[00:18:00]  And I think it's a little bit of luck that, um, the, the death toll is, is as low as it  is.  But when you look at how many people were, were injured and seriously injured, that's  pretty fucking bad.  Right.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  Three dead so far.  I mean, you got a, I think you got a close to 20 people and over a hundred people injured.  That's crazy.  50 now, I think.  But you got about 20, uh, in, in critical condition in hospitals.  And they're confirming ball bearings on the outside of the bomb. 
[00:18:30]  So, uh, yeah.  So those, you know, those fly out in all directions, just rip, rip limbs off.  This is exactly what it did.  Jesus.  So it was a little more sophisticated than just, you know, some kids with a pipe bomb kind  of a situation.  So, well, um, it was so annoying to hear of Obama talking.  We're on the same page.  I'm ready to just know what it was going to say.  Don't jump to conclusions.  Like just, well, it's all, it's all the same nonsense that they, they say, you know, when  something goes down.  Yeah.  Instead of talking like a human being, it's, it's, it's everything that Obama said, we 
[00:19:00]  are, we've heard a million times by, it was his Benghazi speech by him and, and past  presidents.  No one just talks to the people anymore.  We'll get who did this.  So, will we?  Oh, I thought we were going to let this one go.  Yeah.  I thought this time we'd let it go.  We're really, we're going to, we're going to hunt them down and get them.  That's all of our resources are available to the people of Boston.  Of course they are.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  It's all, of course stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No shit.  I just don't like being told constantly to stop telling me, don't jump to conclusions. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop telling me that.  The only time I've jumped to conclusions wrong since 1994 was in Oklahoma.  Yeah.  Every other time I've stepped, I've stepped knowingly into the correct conclusion.  Stop fucking telling me that.  I don't go, and I don't go out and string people up.  All right.  Even if I assume it's a Saudi guy.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I didn't start, I'm not starting a giant frenzy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think what I want.  See, then everyone has their opinion.  This guy, well, let me, let me go to Boomer in Jersey.  Uh, Boomer, go ahead, sir. 
[00:20:00]  Morning, boys.  Hey, they were just saying on Fox News that, uh, they shut down cell service, and they think  that's why the other bombs did not go off.  Oh, right.  They did that yesterday to stop any remote detonations.  Uh, no, I, why wouldn't you set them off like.  Yeah, no, they would, they probably wanted the other bombs to go off around the same  time the other two went off.  They didn't shut down cell service immediately.  And there's no confirmation that they were cell, uh, cell detonated bombs.  We got a lady, they're showing on the phone, on her cell phone after the attack. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, it took a while for them to, to shut down cell service.  Yeah, that's what they were just saying, so I don't know.  Well, and no one's confirmed that it's fucking, you know, it just could have been a timer.  Right.  You know, timers on the fucking things.  You don't know.  Holy shit, look at this guy's pants.  It's unbelievable, yeah.  But he's walking.  Like, that guy's all right.  He's like, the front of his pants was just ripped.  Crazy.  It looks like he's wearing almost, um.  He's a lucky guy.  Chaps.  Like, his fucking, his slacks have been ripped off.  The front of, uh, his pants just ripped completely off from the ankles up to the crotch. 
[00:21:00]  Um.  That guy lost his leg.  It was fucking terrible.  My son, my son saw one guy on the hotel patio.  He'd lost his leg.  I wonder if that was right over the blast.  Terrible.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Like, right over it?  Uh, no, it was all street level.  They have, they have these patios that are kind of, you know, on the sidewalk.  On street level, yeah.  On Boylston.  There's a few places that have that.  I kind of know that area.  I always like, uh, when I go to Boston, I stay on Boylston and hang out on, uh, Newbury Street 
[00:21:30]  and all that.  It's just, it's just a nice part of the city, close to Copley Square and all.  Uh, here's Obama and what he had to say yesterday.  And, and they kept, not teasing him, but saying, you know, Obama's going to be, you know, speaking  to the nation.  And, and the whole time, just like Jimmy, I saw what you tweet.  I'm like, he's not going to say anything.  He's not going to comfort anyone.  It's just going to be just nonsense.  He's not good at this.  Not, not many presidents, presidents are or were. 
[00:22:00]  Reagan's very good.  Reagan was great.  We always go back to Reagan.  He was really good at, uh.  He knew how to talk to the people.  Making people feel good after some bullshit.  Even if his shit was bullshit, he just knew how to deliver it better.  Exactly.  I don't know.  But you knew Obama wasn't going to say anything that was going to comfort anyone.  No.  Boston police, firefighters, and first responders, as well as the National Guard, responded heroically  and continue to do so as we speak.  It's a reminder that so many Americans serve and sacrifice on our behalf every single day 
[00:22:30]  without regard to their own safety in dangerous and difficult circumstances.  Man, we salute all those who assisted in responding so quickly and professionally to this tragedy.  We still do not know who did this or why.  And people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts.  I hate that.  There's only so much he can say.  He doesn't know anything yet.  But I hate being told don't jump to conclusions.  We all know what you're saying.  But why is it that the president is scheduled to speak, they go, okay, we're going to do this 
[00:23:00]  at 6'10", and then you don't hear from him again.  I would like a president that pops on, I don't know, another four or five times before everyone goes to bed.  Yeah.  A little update of the situation.  He hasn't really said anything since.  That's the type of guy I would love to see.  Yeah.  Like, you know what, I'm going to pop on again.  Well, what do you got to say?  I don't really know.  I'm just going to fucking talk for two minutes.  All right.  And everybody was looking at him to see what he was going to say on the heels of the Benghazi situation. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And, again, he didn't use the word terrorism this time around either, which seems very calculated to not use it.  I don't know what.  This is terrorism.  I don't know why.  This is absolutely terrorism.  Regardless of who it is, it's terrorism.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Right.  There's no doubt in anyone's mind.  Yeah.  But he hasn't talked since, he hasn't talked in 12 hours.  It was 6 o'clock last night.  Yeah.  Our president.  Like, just jump on the fucking, on the TV.  Just say anything. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe he's planning another vacation.  What are you going to do?  But, make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this.  Oh.  And we will find out who did this.  We'll find out why they did this.  Like Benghazi.  Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight.  Of justice.  Yeah.  Today is a holiday in Massachusetts.  Patriots Day.  It's a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American 
[00:24:30]  city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our nation.  And it's a day that draws the world to Boston's streets in a spirit of friendly competition.  Boston is a tough and resilient town.  So are its people.  I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and  move forward as one proud city.  And as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings. 
[00:25:00]  We're still in the investigation stage at this point, but I just want to reiterate,  we will find out who did this, and we will hold them accountable.  Will you?  Great.  Thank you very much.  Thank God.  Yuck.  That's what I said when he was done.  Yuck.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing.  That was nothing.  Another robot speech by a politician.  Yeah.  Fucking hate politicians.  They're the worst. 
[00:25:30]  Then you had Mayor Menino.  He didn't seem to be saying too much, huh?  Well, Mayor Menino is very sick.  Well, I know.  He's got busted gam, right?  Yeah.  We didn't even talk about it.  I mean, he steps down.  Well, he didn't officially step down, but he said he's not going to run again.  And, you know, he was walking with a cane.  Don't mind me.  No worries.  He was walking with a cane last we talked about him.  And then a couple days ago, he broke his leg.  We didn't even talk about it on our show.  So he's in the hospital.  But he had to show his face. 
[00:26:00]  And he showed his face at a press conference.  He was in a wheelchair.  He talked briefly.  We haven't seen him since either.  But I don't think he's in the right frame of mind to take on something like this.  He was passing it on to the...  I think he's a pretty sick man.  The commissioner, right?  He was passing it on to the governor and the police and fire commissioners.  But you know what?  When something happens in your city, the mayor is like the guy that is supposed to get up  and really kind of give that rah-rah speech.  We've seen it, obviously, with Giuliani and even Dunn-Bloomberg when things have happened. 
[00:26:30]  He does get up and talk about what has happened.  Right.  To not see...  You've got to show your leadership.  ...the mayor get up there was a weird...  Yeah, it was very weird.  He's in a bad place.  I think he is in a very bad place.  He's in a very bad place.  He's sick.  I think, yeah.  I mean, how did he even break his leg if he's moving around slowly to begin with?  Yeah.  You know, it wasn't like he was on the tennis court or something.  He was already feeble when he was making his announcement two weeks ago. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, there's shit going on with him that I don't think they're really saying.  No, they're keeping it under wraps.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's why you only heard him briefly yesterday.  The governor and I have spoken with the president of the United States just a half hour ago when  he's off at all the...  You know what I found strange?  Hmm.  You know, we're not really going for the jokes today, but he spoke pretty good here.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really did.  A little fire under his ass.  Yeah, there was more of an energy and, you know, he was more fast-paced with his speech. 
[00:27:30]  ...to us doing this investigation.  Myself, as I may offer my condolences and prayers for families that are involved in this explosion.  But also, family needs some assistance.  They'd call the mayor's hotline if we need some information over the next 24 to 48 hours.  But let me just say that this is a tragedy.  We're going to work together on this, and Boston police, the state police, FBI, all the agencies  we just met, and we're committed to working together and making sure that we come to a 
[00:28:00]  finale of what happened this afternoon.  And the governor has been very helpful to us on some of the issues this afternoon.  So I'll turn it over to the governor and have him say a few words.  Look at that.  That was like he rushed right through it.  Yeah, that's it.  Right.  I like the fact that he said explosion.  You know, it's so funny when you hear these guys talk how they avoid, like the police commissioner  yesterday said, yeah, they expired.  No, they're dead.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop using fucking language like that. 
[00:28:30]  Like, you know, they keep, I love what they say, in light of the incidents today.  Incidents.  How about in light of the attack?  Right.  Or in light of the explosions?  You know, you don't have to soften every fucking thing you say and sanitize everything you  say to us.  We're really softening our language.  You're right.  It was weird to hear him say explosion.  Right.  Like, that's how used to you are to these guys.  Yeah.  Not saying that type of thing?  No, the soft term or the rounded term.  You know, the term that won't upset.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then they'll show all the blood.  I mean, what's the fucking difference? 
[00:29:00]  If you're going to show the carnage, then use real language.  Real words.  Then you have the boss of police commenting on the devices here.  I'd like to clarify one statement.  The device at the JFK library was actually an incendiary device or a fire.  We haven't linked that directly to this incident.  So right now, this incident consists of two explosions that occurred on Boylston Street.  The information that we got about 15 minutes before the prior press conference could very 
[00:29:30]  well be premature.  Sure. But we are still asking people to be to be calm, to to go to their homes and to  and to work closely with us.  There was no specific intelligence.  We certainly increase our posture around a big event like this.  All of those things happened in preparation for this event.  But there was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen.  Yeah.  I didn't realize how much he looked like East Side Day.  East Side Day.  Dan Shaughnessy, right?  Yeah, that's Shaughnessy on MSNBC.  Break Hill and Newton, a turn at the fire station. 
[00:30:00]  You come in, down through Coolidge Corner, into Kenmore.  And at Fenway, you can see from the press box the runners coming into Kenmore.  Press box.  It's always been this great day, 117 years.  People lined up four or five deep all over the route.  Great atmosphere, families, all of that.  And to have this shattered in such a way, it really takes everyone aback here in Boston.  And it forever changes one of our great institutions. 
[00:30:30]  So sad.  It always was a really good day in Boston.  Oh, my God.  Listening to the dispatches on the radio yesterday, it was like, you know, wow.  Well, yeah, there are reports of a bomb.  Reports of a bomb.  God, that accent.  Jesus.  So what do they got on this Saudi man?  He's 20 years old.  He's here on a student visa. 
[00:31:00]  He's under heavy guard at a hospital.  20-year-old Saudi.  That doesn't fit the bill.  Yeah, right.  Their sources say that he smelled of gunpowder when grabbed by police and declared, I thought  there would be a second bomb.  He also allegedly asked, did anyone die?  Whoops.  Authorities stress they do not have a suspect, but they're talking to numerous people.  Yeah.  When they were saying, because I guess the New York Post online was reporting this guy was  in the hospital, and the hospital had a heavy SWAT presence at the front doors and stuff 
[00:31:30]  as security, which seems a little odd for the hospital to have that kind of security  for something like this.  And then they say, yeah, the Saudi guy is in there, and the Post reported that they had  him, and they were guarding him and questioning him.  And everybody said, ah, the Post, shut up.  And then people started reporting, oh, yeah, well, I guess they do have a Saudi guy. 
[00:32:00]  And then the police guy gets up, and he says, well, I don't know where these stories are coming  from.  There's no one in custody.  They would use words like in custody, which doesn't mean they don't have somebody that  they're questioning.  And then somebody said, do you have specific rooms being guarded at the hotel?  Hospital or hotel?  At the hospital.  Okay.  And the police commissioner gave this weird answer of, he didn't say yes or no. 
[00:32:30]  He was like, well, we've taken steps that will secure certain, like, it was a no, non-answer.  It's probably because if they're looking for a second person, you don't want them to know  that we have the first person.  Right.  You never want to make the announcement like, you know, we have guy one, guy two, if you're  out there.  But how would they get this guy so quickly?  You're a guy, you drop, let's say, he's a backpack in a garbage pail.  Yeah.  And then you're walking out of there. 
[00:33:00]  Like, how are they going to fucking get you that quickly?  He got burned.  So it might have fucking gone off when he was walking away.  And then what, people pointed, like, we saw this guy fucking...  Could be, yeah.  That.  It could just be the fact that they were going to help him and he started saying things that  were a little fishy, like that.  Right.  You know, hey, I thought there was going to be a second bomb.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Also, early this morning, law enforcement interviewed two men at an apartment and removed  two trash bags and a duffel bag.  It is not known if they're suspects.  The apartment is in a building on the street where the Saudi man lives. 
[00:33:30]  So it might be where the Saudi actually lives.  Yeah.  But they're not saying that officially.  But it's on the same street, they're willing to say.  So obviously they went to this guy's apartment.  Yeah.  And disassembled it.  They took some stuff out.  They know.  They know way more than we know.  Oh, they know a fuckload more than we know at this point, especially.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll give us more shit later today.  Yeah, maybe.  With some dribs and drabs of information. 
[00:34:00]  They're keeping tight-lipped for whatever reason right now.  All Americans stand with the people of Boston, Obama said.  Of course.  Isn't that nice?  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  I just wish our leader, and I'm not saying it because I hate Obama or any of that.  I don't like any of those guys in that position.  We just talk like a human being to the people.  They don't even know how at that point in their life.  You don't think they do?  No.  They've been politicians so long, they don't know what it's like to really have a conversation. 
[00:34:30]  Every word is written out and calculated, especially Obama.  You know, obviously I have no love for the guy, but fuck, man.  The guy brings a teleprompter to a fifth-grade fucking classroom.  Did he really?  To talk to kids.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's like, the guy has never spoken in just a sincere, honest fucking word.  It's crazy.  When he was campaigning, we got bamboozled because a lot of people were talking about  how this guy knew how to talk to the people.  Yeah.  And he gave some amazing speeches early on. 
[00:35:00]  I think the one time he kind of shot off the cuff was when he was talking about Newtown.  I actually believe that he was really, I'm not saying he didn't have his teleprompter.  Oh, yeah.  He was a little different then.  Yeah.  I got to give him a little credit for that.  You're right.  He was a little different that day.  And when he said, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.  Yeah.  That's probably his also.  Good job.  Good job.  They caught the Saudi guy by the spectators tackling him because he looked suspicious.  That's coming in from Bo.  I haven't heard that.  And then someone saying the Saudi national was cleared yesterday. 
[00:35:30]  This is all that info that's just kind of up in the air.  It wasn't cleared yesterday.  It's obvious he wasn't cleared yesterday.  It doesn't seem that he's been officially cleared.  No.  If he was cleared yesterday, why were they going into his fucking apartment this morning?  Overnight.  Right.  And, yeah, and early this morning.  People just, they fucking, I don't know where they hear shit and see stuff and then you  do some research and post something and they call you an asshole. 
[00:36:00]  Everyone just tries to figure it out.  They get a little nugget.  They pass it along.  You know, obviously you're not going to know everything about the situation.  There's going to be speculating and stuff.  But there are certain things that are fact that some people still don't even get a fucking  hold on.  How do you feel about the news?  Like, obviously there's a horrific situation, right?  Yeah.  How do you feel?  And they do this all the time.  Then they have, it's almost like they go, okay, this is really bad, but we got to make 
[00:36:30]  it worse for our viewers.  Always.  So now it's time to find out who the youngest victim is.  Yeah.  Because you know that's going to pull at everyone's heartstrings when we find a kid died.  It's not bad enough that, you know, like, you know, adults died, but now it's like, okay,  now we got to really push it forward and find the youngest victim.  And we're finding out it's an eight-year-old.  Eight-year-old.  Dude, I saw that.  And people say like, well, it is a news fact, but it seems to me so calculated by the news. 
[00:37:00]  They love the morbid part of this whole thing.  Because it's so horrific.  We don't need to, you don't need to push this as a horrific event.  We get it.  Yeah.  But the news, they almost are insecure with their own reporting and themselves.  They're like, well, no, man, we're not sure how much, we want them watching longer.  We got to now find the youngest victim.  That and some of the questions they were asking the doctor during his press conference,  they were, it was a feeding frenzy of reporters ganging up on this doctor.  Right.  And they were yelling out, this one, this one guy is like, 
[00:37:30]  can you tell us exactly how many amputations there were?  He said that.  He's like, he's like, he wanted to know.  Yeah.  How many?  Um, uh, what, what?  And they asked, did you find any separate heads?  Right.  It's like, what, what was the, and he goes, what's the most horrific injury you saw?  It's like, what the fuck?  It's like, what's the line between reporting the news and doing the public service and telling  us and be, and when do they cross over to being these morbid scum guys?  I, I, I think there are times when they could push some of that shit forward. 
[00:38:00]  Cause they're, they're in, they're, they're in a business.  Let's be honest.  They're making money off, uh, reporting the news, but I just feel like there's some of  these events where it's so obvious that they should just take a step back and go, okay,  we don't have to do that fucking nonsense.  No.  Everyone gets this one.  Dude, because when people talk about it today.  That's a good question, Jimmy.  I don't know where the fine line is.  Where is that line?  When people talk about it today though, they will be like, and did you hear there were  20 amputations?  Right, right.  Like, because they, they, they'll hear it on the news and, and it's morbid and, and, 
[00:38:30]  but they love talking about it.  Look at the front page of the paper.  This poor woman.  She, boy, does she look like, what the fuck happened?  I just came to the marathon.  Right.  I see a picture on both papers.  Right.  But you wonder where does it like, because then their, their argument would be, well,  yeah, but we're trying to tell you what happened.  Like, well, this is what happened.  This is the, these are the injuries and we're just reporting it.  And so where's that line?  Yeah.  And, and they would certainly say to, to me, uh, look, it's a news fact.  Okay.  It is.  We all know that it is a news fact, but is it, is it that necessary to really yank at 
[00:39:00]  the, the heartstrings?  I mean, just look at the front page of the paper.  I've never seen this much blood in a newspaper before.  Yeah.  It becomes, I never even, I never saw this much blood when, um, 9-11 went down.  No, there was not much blood.  Yeah.  That wasn't really as bloody when you look.  Right.  It's, uh, I've never seen so much blood in a newspaper.  Plus 9-11, it seems like it was an hour when everything was videotaped.  But you forget, people didn't have sophisticated cell phone cameras. 
[00:39:30]  Then you had a video camera.  You didn't.  And that's only 10, 12 years ago.  Yeah.  It's only, yeah, you're right.  A little over, well, call it 12 years ago.  I mean, what, they finally found, what, two videos of, of the, uh, planes going in?  Well, the first one.  The first one, obviously, yeah.  Because no one had, no one had that capability.  Now we all do.  Almost every single person does.  We got an expert on the line.  I want to thank Stuntbrain.  He got us, uh, Buck Sexton.  Oh, yeah.  He's been on our show a few times.  Hey, Buck.  Hi. 
[00:40:00]  How you doing?  Hello.  It's just a weird day to be a broadcaster.  It is indeed.  How would we know?  Yeah, exactly.  We've heard, allegedly.  It's just strange, because, you know, we're not experts at any of this shit.  We're just talking like anyone else.  Well, this brings back memories for me.  I was in NYPD Intelligence Division when, uh, Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber,  uh, you know, I got that call right away, and it was all hands on deck, and nobody was  going home until we found that guy.  And, uh, I would assume right now it's the same thing with the, uh, Boston authorities, 
[00:40:30]  the Joint Terrorism Task Force, JTTF.  This is the kind of thing where everybody just, uh, like I said, everyone joins together  and they decide that this guy's going down, this guy's, it couldn't be plural, we don't  know yet.  Whoever it is, uh, they're gonna, they're gonna get him just like we got Shahzad.  Wait, you, oh, so you were working when, when Bloomberg made the brilliant statement  about how it could be somebody who was against healthcare reform?  How, when Bloomberg really had his finger on the pulse of the city and thought it might  be a right-wing nut who tried to bomb Times Square? 
[00:41:00]  I can tell you that every professional I was working with at the time who actually knows  anything about terrorism, when we heard that, our eyebrows went sky high.  We're like, whoa.  Isn't it amazing?  What, what is it in, in politics, if you've dealt with these guys, that they feel this  need to get people to try to look away from what we all know is probably the truth?  I think they just can't help themselves.  Uh, yesterday there were so many of these pundits and just, just asserting this ridiculous, 
[00:41:30]  uh, to call it sort of early stage analysis to give away too much credibility.  I mean, these guys are stepping far outside the lines and saying things about, uh, you  know, that they started to try to get in the mind of, of, of who this is.  Like, we don't even have any evidence yet.  We, we have no idea where this is coming from.  And, and many people on the other side of it were so slow to call it a terrorist attack  because they, they didn't want to be lumped in with the sort of early analyzers.  And all I could say is, no, no, this is a terrorist attack.  Right, right.  You know, this is a terrorist attack. 
[00:42:00]  Within five minutes of hearing the story, I'm like, this is a terrorist attack.  What, what do you think, um, uh, the FBI, uh, is doing right now with, with, uh, the, the  evidence and with the, uh, unexploded, uh, bombs that they picked up?  Well, they're going to be looking for a signature from the bomb.  They're going to be looking for something that tips them off either in terms of material or how  it's constructed, how it's put together.  And quite honestly, a lot of the stuff you see on sort of like the CSI shows in terms 
[00:42:30]  of going back through video footage, looking at faces in the crowd and that, I mean, that  stuff is legit.  I mean, that's what they're going to be doing.  We know what the, uh, we, we know what the crowds looked like roughly around the, around  the bombs at the time.  A big question now is, were these command detonated or were they standoff devices?  Meaning somebody calling with a cell phone, um, which is very familiar from, from my time  in Iraq.  I mean, if somebody calls on a cell phone, gives a signal and you, and you get the explosion  or was it on a timer, which could have even been a sort of a simple time device down the 
[00:43:00]  new, you know, obviously the marathon goes on for a number of hours.  So it would have been hard to do that.  That's what they're going to be looking at right now.  Um, and they're hoping to get that one lead because that's what it tends to be.  It's one lead that breaks and boom.  Now all of a sudden you've actually got a, you've got a hot case.  Is it true that they found, I mean, I'm hearing on Twitter again, you know, who knows if it's  accurate, but they found one of the bombs unexploded under the stands at the finish line.  Is that where the other one was?  Or one of them?  I've, I've seen it in a bunch of press reports that that is the case. 
[00:43:30]  Uh, you know, everybody that I know who knows about this stuff, isn't talking and everybody  I know who wants to know more is calling people like madness.  Uh, you know, I mean, in terms of being sort of inside the community.  Um, but I do think there were, there were on, there was unexploded ordnance that to the  best of what I've seen everywhere.  And of course, the second that we knew there were two explosions where they were and what  the damage was, and this was obviously a direct terrorist attack.  I mean, ball bearings.  This is like a straight out of not saying it is Al Qaeda, but it is straight out of the 
[00:44:00]  Al Qaeda handbook.  Right, right.  Yeah.  And what about this, uh, Saudi, uh, national that they, um, supposedly have at the hospital,  uh, questioning him?  You, you hear anything on this?  Yeah, I, I know that they're calling him a, a person of interest, you know, a POI, uh,  and that means a whole broad array of things, right?  He could be somebody that, you know, right.  I know that they've, uh, there's been a little leak about how he's a Saudi national and he's  on a student visa.  I wouldn't say to people, I mean, this is Boston. 
[00:44:30]  There are a lot of people on student visas, but it doesn't, you know, it doesn't mean  one way or the other.  It just means, you know, let's not get too far ahead of things.  Uh, he, he could be the guy that either was, who knows, he could be responsible.  He could tell us, uh, what the guy looked like who was, or he could be quite honestly,  a waste of time.  And they're calling him a POI because they don't want to tip their hand about what information  they're getting from this guy.  If he does have actionable intelligence, if he knows stuff that is critical to some of the 
[00:45:00]  solving what actually happened yesterday, they want to move on it before the press  knows about it.  And so that's why they're, they're being pretty tight-lipped about what's going on with this  guy.  Isn't it possible?  Is it possible that he is not at all who they're, they have, what they're looking for,  but they throw out some bullshit like that just, uh, to keep people that he might be working  with from fleeing?  Sure.  I mean, disinformation in this kind of a circumstance would not be outside the realm of, of, uh,  a possibility.  Uh, they got to do what they got to do to make sure that they, there's, you know, there's 
[00:45:30]  a couple of things.  I mean, it looks like everyone's calmed down about the possibility of follow on attacks.  That's usually a major, look, we know there's unexploded ordinance.  There could have been, uh, more of this stuff around the city or meant to go off the next  day.  People seem to have calmed down about that for now.  So I think the major, uh, the major thing that's on everyone's mind is Faisal Shahzad,  Times Square bomber, almost got out of the country.  I mean, was very close to making it out of here, even though there was a, you know, everybody  was looking for him. 
[00:46:00]  Uh, they don't want to, they don't want these guys, whether they're domestic or international,  doesn't matter.  They want to get out of the U S and we want to make sure that doesn't happen.  Yeah, exactly.  Man.  Wow.  Um, yeah, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to,  ask you something, but I, uh, seem to have, um, it seems to have slipped my mind.  Oh, with, uh, with your experience now, with, with the, the amount of, uh, evidence that  they supposedly had picked up, uh, do you, do you just a hunch, do you think they'll, they'll 
[00:46:30]  get to the bottom of this?  I do.  I, I really do.  Uh, there's so much now, uh, by way of digital data, you know, all the stuff they can collect  from the area at the time, so much, uh, footage, video footage, photos being taken of the area.  There are news cameras right there.  I mean, we've seen all the, all the, the, the horrific footage, uh, some footage, though,  of course, will be useful for, for tracking down leads.  I think they're going to figure out who this is.  I think it'll happen relatively quickly within the next few days.  They'll at least know who's responsible, finding who's responsible is, is, is a different ball 
[00:47:00]  of wax, but they'll get to it.  I mean, this is, you know, for the guys working this case, Boston is their town too.  I mean, they, they could not be more serious about this and these guys are going to be absolutely  fired up to get the perpetrators.  Do you think, do you think there's any, any way to prevent something like this?  It seems like we're still very vulnerable to these kinds of attacks.  There's unfortunately no way to prevent this entirely.  Uh, when you look at the selection of target, and this goes back years, this goes back even 
[00:47:30]  pre nine 11, people have always been worried about marathons, huge congregation of people  out in the open, you know, where they're going to be way far in advance.  They, they, everyone knows what the, what the route will be.  So this has always been something that's been on people's mind as a possible soft target.  You can't secure 26 miles, 26 plus miles of, of terrain from, from an attack like this.  And quite honestly, we've had a couple of very near misses, uh, particularly over the 
[00:48:00]  last four years, uh, everyone sort of thinks we've been breathing pretty easy about terrorism  until now, but we really shouldn't have necessarily been thinking about it that way.  When you look at the underwear bomber, I mean, if that guy builds a little underwear bomb  differently, that plane goes down, nothing was going to stop them.  Uh, Faisal Shahzad, if he's a slightly better, uh, car bomber, if he knows a little more about  explosives and how to get, how to get a bigger, a bigger boom, uh, you could have had hundreds  of casualties in times square.  I mean, that's in times square. 
[00:48:30]  Cause we got lucky a couple of times and, uh, I don't mean to sound in any way like a being  too glib about this, but at some point your luck runs out.  Um, and they only have to, they only have to get through our defenses once and they  got through our defenses yesterday.  And this is where like a lot of people complain about these street cameras.  Like you're a big brother.  But when something like this happens, it's like, you're glad there's so many just security  cameras and things.  Cause there's really no way in and out of such a populated area without somebody catching  you on film in this day or one security camera catch where like you said, there's going 
[00:49:00]  to be in the next couple of days, a piece of news footage that you're going to see over  and over of a guy walking or of a guy doing something and they think this is him in a  garbage pail or something.  There'll be something that pops up.  Hey, how do you, uh, Buck, how do you feel about the fact that it went off at, uh, four  hours into the marathon?  Do you mean in terms of, of the timing of it?  Yeah, well, cause the, the, the, you know, the elite runners are coming in around two,  two hours and eight minutes, two hours, nine minutes. 
[00:49:30]  Uh, is there significant significance to the fact that this went down two hours after that  point?  Well, it makes me, it makes me think, uh, it may, it's, it's hard to tell whether it  was again, a command detonated device, which would mean, and that could be standoff.  And right now it sounds like, uh, everyone agrees.  It's very unlikely that you had a suicide bombing, right?  They don't have what they would expect to have given that there'd be some pretty specific  telltale signs of that.  But did somebody call in the meaning that they had it set up so that, you know, they have 
[00:50:00]  their cell phone out and, and they press, uh, you know, they press the numbers and then  all of a sudden you get the explosion or was it on a timer?  You know, they may have said, all right, I'm going to get this here and drop it.  A timer seems less likely because a backpack or something dropped for a long period of  time.  But, you know, a timer for five minutes gives the guy plenty of time to get away.  And everyone, everyone's looking at those runners.  I mean, I've been to the New York marathon a bunch of times.  No one's paying attention to what's happening around them. 
[00:50:30]  They're all focused on those runners.  So I think that they probably just tried to set up when there'd be maximum people around,  not necessarily going after the elite runners.  Uh, but, you know, necessarily elite runners, but for the, you know, uh, there's celebrities  down there, there's politicians, there's certainly even more people packed in around the finish  line, uh, at that point.  Yeah.  If you're a homicidal lunatic, this is a target rich environment.  And that's just the unfortunate reality of it.  Uh, if you're somebody who wants to cause maximum carnage, you know, 
[00:51:00]  everyone's going to be getting more into sort of, uh, the, the who's done it aspect of  the next couple of days, but this was a mass casualty attack.  They were just trying to kill as many people as possible.  Of course.  And you bring a, bring up a great point.  You know, when you're watching a marathon, uh, no one is looking behind them at all.  So if you're there to do something like this, you don't give a fuck about the race, obviously.  And you've got everyone just, you know, looking forward.  It's a, it's a perfect opportunity to drop something behind people.  Even comparatively to say a stadium or some of the other big events that come to mind. 
[00:51:30]  You got people looking all over the fucking place.  That's right.  They're checking out.  Oh, look at what's going on over there.  But a marathon, everyone is like, there's no reason to look behind you.  It's a storefront.  Who cares?  And if you're a bad guy and you're trying to do escape and evasion, you're trying to  get away, uh, there's not a limited number of exits.  The whole city is open to you.  You know, they don't have this stuff cordoned off.  It's not like a bomb goes off and they can, uh, you know, they can sort of cordon an area  and all of a sudden they know who's where. 
[00:52:00]  So very tough to secure this kind of an environment.  No, you can pop down a side street very easily after you drop something off.  Exactly.  Very easily.  And I agree, by the way, uh, with, uh, with Mr. Norton, that, uh, there's a very high likelihood  that they're going to get some kind of, there's going to be some guy that we're all staring  at for, you know, a week, weeks to come and we're like, that's the guy.  I think that's probably going to happen.  It'll be some weird thing, background news footage where they have to darken out the rest 
[00:52:30]  and then have the little highlighted circle on the guy, like, you know, like how they  do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the question is, is he going to look like sort of, we're all, you know, we're  all thinking, is he going to look like he's shady or is it the guy who really, uh, tried  to fit in and understood that this is a big event.  And if you look more like sort of a happy tourist, you're not going to stand out.  We'll see that that's all coming.  And like I said, I would assume every resource the federal government has, uh, is that at  Singerton's right now.  I mean, they, this is just sort of, uh, all in for these guys. 
[00:53:00]  So they'll, they'll get to it.  If there's stuff to get to, they're going to get to it.  And do you see anything, um, being put in place, uh, for other events, uh, in the,  in the near future and far future that are, um, we're going to have to go through  much like we did at the airports now after nine 11.  And, uh, every time something happens, it seems like, uh, there's a few more things,  a few more hoops.  We got to jump through in life.  Absolutely.  That's going to go down now.  I'm, I'm worried about that already.  I'm writing about this on the blaze.com trying to convince people, don't start trading your 
[00:53:30]  liberty for the perception of security.  People love doing that.  It's not actually security.  Uh, and in a situation like this, the most important thing we can do is find the guys  who are responsible and, and, and put them away forever.  I don't know if Massachusetts actually has anything beyond life in prison.  And I can't remember off the top of my head.  That's the most important thing we can do is, is actually find, uh, find the guys responsible  because there's just no way you're ever going to be able to stop this kind of thing from 
[00:54:00]  look, they could have gone Mumbai style.  And to me, it's more than one individual, which again, it could have been one guy seems  to me a little unlikely, but it could have been one guy.  In Mumbai style, they get a bunch of guys who have some basic firearms training and they  get into an area like this and they'll shoot a hundred people before anyone can get in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This, this is, this is the reality of the world we live in.  So I don't think, look, they're going to be grandstanding politicians who pretend like  they have the answer and they can make us all safe as long as we, uh, you know, allow 
[00:54:30]  them to do sort of the, the equivalent of the TSA body check pat down at every single  public event.  We've got to say, no, we don't want that because it's not going to make us safer.  It's not going to stop people from dying in these kinds of attacks.  Most important thing you could do is find and eliminate the bad guys.  Yeah.  And how do you feel about, uh, the people that think the government's involved?  Uh, they're, you know, idiots.  I don't know what else to say.  I remember, you know, right after nine 11 and I remember other tax people, you know,  make these assertions.  I think there was actually a guy in one of the press conferences with, uh, governor 
[00:55:00]  Deval Patrick, the reporter, and his first question was, is this a false flag to steal  our dollars?  Yeah.  You know what?  Hold on.  We happen to have that.  Hold on.  A false flag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's an Alex Jones guy.  He was dispatched pretty quickly.  We're going to get into the Alex Jones video, uh, after the break, but this, this is what  you're, uh, referencing.  Have to take any questions.  Well, sir, why would a lot of speakers tell the people when you all this stuff, the economy  moments before the bottom went off, is this another false flag stage attack to take our 
[00:55:30]  civil liberties and put more homeless security, uh, sticking their hands down on the pants  on the streets?  No.  Next question.  You have that next question?  No.  No.  Next question.  No.  He looked really annoyed, too.  But it's just such a dumb fucking, first of all, do you think he's going to tell you?  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  Well, the problem is, though, that world is growing.  There's more and more people that are onto that.  If you're a conspiracy theorist, false flag is your go-to, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's the big catchphrase. 
[00:56:00]  That's the catchphrase, right?  Whoever's whoever.  And you're positive.  You think it makes you sound cool, like you know what's going on.  Yeah.  So whoever's responsible is not really responsible.  There's somebody else, and they're putting your responsibility on somebody.  So this just allows you, you know, this sort of endless loop of it wasn't who we think  it is, and also, like I said, people who have no idea how a terrorism investigation works,  how an attack is conducted, whatever, they get to sound like they have some idea of what  was going on.  Some knowledge.  Really, they're just buffoons.  It really is ridiculous.  It really is odd how an hour or two after it, already people have, you know, the conspiracy 
[00:56:30]  theorists just, they're obsessed with everything being in that world.  Nothing's as it seems.  They refuse to accept anything is as it seems, and they think that makes them smart and not  gullible, but it really does just make them seem like fucking dumb idiots.  Exactly.  They seem, it's amazing to me, only the conspiracy theorists after this kind of an attack, really,  in terms of Americans, the only people that I know who aren't going to at least have a  moment of, we're in this together, you know, President Obama, use every tool you got, 
[00:57:00]  use these guys, and we put everything else aside.  The only people that don't do that, the conspiracy theorists, because they think that President  Obama was like, is like a cyborg, and, you know, this is all fake, and the Queen of England  rules the world, and whatever.  She's a lizard.  So, they don't even make a concession for the immediate aftermath of this kind of an attack,  because, again, they think it's a false flag op, because of the Illuminati, or whatever  else it is that they say. 
[00:57:30]  Unbelievable.  Hey, Buck, where can people follow you and check out what you got to say?  Sure.  So, on TheBlaze.com today, I'm going to have a piece sort of analyzing this, soup to nuts,  top to bottom, giving my sense of where things are, where the investigation is going.  So, just check out Buck Sexton on TheBlaze.com.  Also, I'll be tweeting out anything I see worthwhile, any articles, anything I think people will want  to know about with this investigation from my Twitter account, at Buck Sexton.  Very good.  Thank you, Buck.  Cool, man.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Great talking to you. 
[00:58:00]  Take it easy, man.  Buck Sexton from TheBlaze.com.  Yes.  Speaking of false flags, after the break, we'll do the Alex Jones video.  Oh, yeah.  He's just out of his fucking mind.  This is great for his business.  Oh, okay, folks.  The dramatic pullback.  Oh, wait till you see the dramatic video.  It's great.  On CNN, I think, because they mentioned Wolf Blitzer, and then the dramatic pullback.  Okay.  Let me break this down for you.  We were in Boston, and they had said to us, you stay away from that trash can.  And I said, well... 
[00:58:30]  Wait till you hear it.  Wait till you hear it.  I wonder if the word stand down is...  Oh, stand down will be there.  When I'm right here, stand down.  And they were told to stand down.  Shut up.  Black Ops.  They're using JFK movie...  JFK movie lines.  That never happened.  Hey, Norad, stand down.  Okay.  Okay.  Shut up, you fucking assholes.  Okay.  God, I hate them.  Jack asses.  They still...  The conspiracy theorists just hate my gut so much, and believe me, it's fucking mutual. 
[00:59:00]  Good.  It's fucking mutual.  What did the Westboro Baptist Church have to say?  Are they going to be...  Predictable.  Are they going to be protesting the funeral?  I hope they do show up in Boston, because for some reason, I think Boston is a little  more ornery than a lot of the other places.  A little less tolerant.  Boston's a little less tolerant.  Obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  Than they're used to.  All you have to do is walk around the city and know they're less tolerant.  Your mother's fucking cock.  Right.  Yeah.  You just wish that one time... 
[00:59:30]  You never want to see cops get hurt, but you really wish that one time a crowd would  overrun the security.  Yeah.  And just literally take these people's signs.  Just pound them to death with their own signs.  To death.  Yeah.  Just beat them to death.  All right.  We'll do the Alex Jones video after the break.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the sex bagel battles his demons. 
[01:00:00]  Everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila Day was my idea.  But when things go wrong, E-Rock gets personal.  I can come with a woman.  You can't.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick.  Maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife.  I didn't grab her tits.  No.  I don't think she's proud of this particular show. 
[01:00:30]  Then insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign off.  Go home.  No one needs you.  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9-0-8, 8-  Try it again.  9-0-8, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A lot to go home.  We may get the truth.  And I know, I know that he doesn't like me. 
[01:01:00]  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Morning BJs.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide.  You know, as we move into the future, personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to our daily lives. 
[01:01:30]  Why, look.  There is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton.  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this.  I arch my asshole out.  And I fucking open the cheeks.  And I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean.  Even on those extra messy days?  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll take a wet wipe or whatever.  And I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up. 
[01:02:00]  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know?  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean.  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton. 
[01:02:30]  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today.  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer. 
[01:03:00]  Listen to this one.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera.  And he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go.  He has to go now.  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  So I go there.  I open the door.  I'm going to open the door.  There's shit on my fingers.  So I'm like, what is this?  So I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands. 
[01:03:30]  And it's fresh.  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it.  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking around.  And I look at him.  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts.  I finally get up the stairs.  And I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs, where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have 
[01:04:00]  fell out of his shorts.  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  Like, there's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people are just staring at me going, I can't believe someone let their dog just  defecate on the sidewalk.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? 
[01:04:30]  What the fuck are you doing?  Not another fucking Dylan thing.  Yeah, but what is he doing?  51 years ago for this song.  That's shit.  I like this song.  No.  Just a weird day to be playing Blowing in the Wind.  Ugh.  Cannonballs fly.  This song, 50 years old?  51 now.  Wow.  The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind. 
[01:05:00]  It's a good song.  I like this one, too.  I don't like this fucking...  I don't like that horn.  Stupid harmonica.  So, um...  Trying to figure it all out, like everyone else.  Still no info.  No new info.  And then I'm looking at just headlines and stuff.  And the Boston Bruins actually had to explain why they postponed their game last night.  I think it's pretty obvious. 
[01:05:30]  But Travis said, yeah, they had to explain it.  Where did Travis go?  Because he knows more about this than I did.  Why would they have to explain that?  I don't think anyone was up for hockey last night in Boston.  People are dummies.  That's why.  Well, did they have to explain it, or did they just to cut off any dumb questions?  It says why we postponed an NHL game.  Like, I would assume that somebody, you know, needed an answer.  You got that, Sam?  I got tickets.  What the fuck? 
[01:06:00]  What do you got on it?  After consultation with the city, state, and NHL officials, we collectively made the decision to postpone tonight's game.  Public safety personnel from the city and state are still gathering information regarding today's events.  And it is vital that they have all resources available for their investigation.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone in the Bruins organization are with the city of Boston and all those affected by today's tragedy. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, maybe they didn't want it to seem like they're caving in, you know, to a terrorism kind of thing.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then they said, like, look, we got people that normally would do security here that need to be elsewhere.  You know what?  That explains it.  All right, that explains it.  You know what?  Now it makes sense.  Yeah.  Because you don't want, you want to try to move on with life in general.  But I'm sure the cops that normally would have had the detail there were a little busy. 
[01:07:00]  Right, of course.  Okay.  No, all right.  We walked through it.  We walked ourselves through it.  We did.  We did.  Yeah.  We figured it out on the spot.  Alex Jones has the whole thing figured out for everybody, by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Nobody has answers today.  Just a lot of questions.  And, but Alex Jones already figured this whole fucking thing out for everybody.  A mere, it looks like a mere half hour to 40 minutes after one day.  Nothing ever just happens the way it looks like it happened. 
[01:07:30]  There's always a conspiracy.  It just goes way too fucking far with his conspiracy shit.  I think it's okay to ask a lot of questions, but.  Why do you accept none of the answers that the rest of us don't?  Right.  This guy is unbelievable how quickly he jumped on this and is saying the government's involved  and it's a false flag and black ops and we know that this happened, so that's why. 
[01:08:00]  Stand down.  Stand down.  You weren't, no one was told to steal.  Bill of Noddy, New World Order.  New World Order.  What else are we going to hear here?  And I'll be honest, I haven't seen this yet.  I saw the first minute and I said we got to do this cold on air.  What else?  It's Operation something, you know.  All right.  It's like Operation Tar Heel.  Tar Heel.  So this is Alex Jones and what's great about this video is the dramatic pullout. 
[01:08:30]  Before Alex Jones talks, he has to have something dramatic.  Yes.  And then I wonder if he's going to walk around the room in this one where his cameraman has  to follow him and if he's going to aggressively lean toward the camera and point into the lens.  It's, yeah, it's all shaky cam too.  It's a quick video.  You know, the video starts with a shot of the TV with CNN, live coverage, breaking news, bombs in Boston at the Boston Railroad. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  Hit it, Sam.  And Peter, what are you waiting to hear for, to hear about in these coming hours?  I think the actual, the constituency inside the bomb is going to make a big difference about how we identify the person who did this or the persons who did this.  Because if it's hydrogen peroxide, that points to Al-Qaeda.  If it's something else, it could be a different, could be a right-wing extremes group or some other group.  I now turn it over to Wolf Blitzer and the situation for him for the latest on it.  All right, folks. 
[01:09:30]  I went on the, I love, right off the bat.  All right, folks.  Now he's going to lay it out for us.  Thank God, because, uh, all right, folks.  He's the only one that can figure this out for us.  We're too stupid to figure this out.  Yeah.  All right, folks.  I went on the radio today, hours before this happened.  It's on record, the 15th of April.  And I said, I can see all the scripting with the TV shows, the movies, where it's the right-wing patriots that are going to stage the terror.  They're going to merge with Al-Qaeda, Founding Fathers, the following, all these shows. 
[01:10:00]  And I said, I see them staging it very soon.  Because I see a crescendo of the preparation going.  When you know what's going on, the stuff's all scripted.  And just about 30 minutes ago, it's like 425.  Show people the atomic clock.  425 Central.  He's got his atomic clock.  Why not just say, show people the clock?  No, it's the atomic clock.  You can't fuck with the atomic clock.  I will say, they're in a kitchen. 
[01:10:30]  This is a great video, because behind him, you can just see, like, a fucking coffee pot.  Yeah.  It's not really a NORAD-looking place.  But he's got an atomic clock.  That's pretty good.  That is true.  We don't have an atomic clock.  No.  That's pretty impressive.  That's probably three seconds more accurate than my iPhone.  They come out and say that it could be right-wing groups.  Now, look.  Here is this establishment, authoritarian site, that poses as liberal. 
[01:11:00]  Alex Jones declares Boston a false flight operation, FBI behind every domestic terror plot.  I put a link to the New York Times with that headline from a year ago.  Why don't you tell them in your article that it was a link to the New York Times?  You're not going to do that.  Even before them, Salon, Boston explosion, a government conspiracy.  We see a false flag to be playing on the Tea Party to expand the TSA.  I said a lot more than that.  They're telling the police there will be bombings everywhere by right-wingers.  They're saying, get ready to arrest Christians.  I mean, this is mainstream news.  Now they're saying it could be Saudis. 
[01:11:30]  My point is, is that it's Patriots Day in Boston while Oath Keepers is there.  I would be crazy to not be concerned.  Now, look at this.  U.N. coach, bomb-stiffing dogs were at start-finish lines.  They had loudspeakers saying, it's just a drill, everything's fine, and then boom, it happens.  That's done over and over again.  7-7, the Madrid bombing, Gladio, they always have drills.  So in case the compartmentalized group of mercenaries doing it with police uniforms or FBI, it varies, get caught, oh, it was part of the drill. 
[01:12:00]  Like when Putin's people got caught back in 99 planting bombs in the fourth building, they were going to blow up to blame on the opposition.  They said, oh, it's part of a drill.  And that's how they got out of the local police station.  Look all this up.  It's a drill.  Oh, we were just practicing robbing the bank, you know, if you get caught.  So that's what's going on.  This article is key.  U.N. coach, bomb-stiffing dogs were at start-and-finish lines.  And this is key.  It proves that the drill was happening even before, during, and then after the marathon. 
[01:12:30]  You understand what that means?  Well, weren't they?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, Chip?  That's right.  You agree with them?  He's fucking right.  Bunch of false flags.  Because everyone's in on it.  When you have dog-sniffing, dog-sniffing bombs, bomb-sniffing dogs throughout the entire day and the entire event, what is he talking about?  When we walk to the parking garage here, there's bomb-sniffing dogs out there.  Right there.  We see one every day.  Yeah.  Every day we see one.  They put them in places that are high risk. 
[01:13:00]  So they're going to bomb this fucking building?  And eventually they could say, no, you know, it was a drill.  We were doing a drill.  We're not part of that.  I don't understand his logic.  I don't either.  At big events, you see the dogs.  That's how you can position the people that are going to be responsible.  Like he said, the uniformed officers, FBI, they're all in on it.  Every single one of them?  I don't know.  Why doesn't anyone ever talk?  The ones that are in on it.  I don't know.  Why doesn't anyone ever talk? 
[01:13:30]  They're amazing people that just keep their mouths shut.  They go, fuck that.  I'm not in on this.  They're amazing.  You can't get 100% of the people onto something.  And to keep quiet.  Right.  Yeah, so they're in on it, and they're there to perpetrate this crime.  Right.  And they're just blending in by being the police officers, the FBI agents, the guys with the  bomb-stiffing dogs.  Yeah.  There's logic there, but it's far-fetched.  No, no, it's right.  And none of the other cops go, none of the other cops go, who are you? 
[01:14:00]  I've never seen you.  Never.  Right.  Quiet.  Quiet, you.  Pipe down.  Stand down.  The one cop will say, is this a flag operation?  They'll go, wink at them, and they go, ah.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  Oh, you got the memo, too?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, good, good.  All right, good.  Yeah, let's hear some more.  Do you understand what that means?  Now, if you go to Infowars.com forward slash listen, or follow us at Twitter at Real Alex  Jones, we're doing live video coverage.  I'll be live tonight at 7. 
[01:14:30]  You can also see our live feed right now with our reporters, Jakari Jackson.  Um, everybody.  Rob Dew, uh, David Knight, everybody.  Adon Salazar, Kurt Nemo.  They are all in here absolutely kicking butt on this in a war room situation.  War room situation.  Hold on, plus, his war room looks worse than our office that we haven't been in in years.  His war room looks like a LAN game that a bunch of fucking people are having. 
[01:15:00]  A bunch of nerds?  Yeah, a bunch of nerds having a LAN party.  That's not a war room.  It really isn't a good war room.  If you're Alex Jones, you got to make your war room look impressive.  Yeah, that's not a war room.  That's a couple computers and a couple guys.  That's it.  And continually.  Now, check this out right here.  Oh, now where's he going?  We've got our incredible team in here working.  John Bowne behind the deal.  Look, you can look right in there.  We've got our crew going right now. 
[01:15:30]  I'm about to go in there with Mike Adams.  So, again, InfoWars.com forward slash listen to find the free video feed and audio feeds.  Get this out on your Twitter, Facebook, you name it.  If we can put attention on the fact they're running a drill, if it was a false flag, which  the globalists have done it over and over again.  They've been caught over and over again.  Gladio, you name it.  Karzai said a few months ago, the West is staging bombings as an excuse to be here and  to destabilize the government.  In Afghanistan, British MI6 has been caught staging bombings, even London Guardian. 
[01:16:00]  In Iraq to keep the war going.  Remember that?  No.  We'd be crazy to not look at them as the main suspects.  They have the motive to get more power.  This could be, you know, real organic terrorists.  They're rare, but they're not like unicorns.  They do exist.  Okay, but almost like unicorns.  It could be mentally ill patsies.  We don't know.  Patsies.  But they have a history.  Patsies.  Oh, fuck.  Hold on, hold on.  They are trying to imply.  We didn't think a patsy as one of the words.  Are you keeping a list today, Sam?  Oh, the words.  We should have asked you.  Oh, that was a good word.  Mentally ill patsies. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, the fucking patsy.  We didn't think.  Describing our listeners.  We didn't think false flag, Illuminati, patsy.  So one of our enemies is going to say that they're going to bomb things to keep the war going,  and we're just going to believe what the enemy says, right?  Yeah.  Why don't you question what he's saying, Alex?  Holy shit.  Well, Karzai is supposed to be our friend. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know if he really is.  No, I know.  That's a bit of a shady situation, of course.  Folks.  But he doesn't question anyone else.  No, he doesn't at all.  If the info fits what he's trying to push forward, then, of course, he doesn't question those people.  He should be the type of guy, my point is, to question everybody.  Why would Karzai lie?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know, Florentine.  Florentine. 
[01:17:30]  Well, patsies, we don't know, but they have a history of it.  So Salon and the rest of you, I was right again, they are trying to imply it could be us, okay?  Who stands to gain from all this, ladies and gentlemen?  But I'll be in there, continued coverage, and you'll be able to see prisonplanet.tv,  nightly news tonight, infowars.com forward slash listen, or follow us at Twitter, Real Alex Shones.  We're going to keep tweeting out the live free link to watch the show.  So Alex Shones signing off for infowars.com.  And the Death Star is orbiting the planet, and it's clear to fire in five minutes. 
[01:18:00]  I mean, they need to do this to turn the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the checkpoints loose on us.  They need to make us the terrorist.  They've been saying we're the terrorist.  They're already scripting that, so we know what comes next in the play.  We've got to counter them on this so that people know where to look.  And anybody with intel in Boston, anything you saw personally, or people that track things on the news,  keep emailing us all your tips because they do not want it out.  They were running drills.  That is big news, and it's not the national news.  It's only here and on local news right here, local 15 TV. 
[01:18:30]  Get that out to everybody.  It's also up on infowars.com.  This is like a game of – it's like an adult role-play game.  Yes, yes.  It reminds me – because when you look at the TSA, and I know people hate the TSA, how bad is it?  Like, you go through security.  I've never had – I've been stopped a lot.  Mildly inconvenient.  It's even faster now than it was before. 
[01:19:00]  And this is 9-11, which was, what, 13 years ago or 12?  12, yeah.  How has my life been so impacted or inconvenienced by the TSA?  I want – yeah, they're annoying sometimes, and, you know, but I want somebody –  I don't want anybody to just be able to get on a plane.  I don't want you to be able to get on a plane with a gun or fucking necessarily mace or a bomb.  So what's the answer?  Like, what is the answer?  Like, I'm happy that somebody is there. 
[01:19:30]  I don't want them looking at my asshole, but I don't mind walking through an x-ray because  I want other people to be – and then you walk through and you shop and you go on the  fucking plane.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Like, in all the years since 9-11, what has happened with the TSA, besides being mildly  irritating, that is so devastating and terrible?  No, nothing.  Explain to me how everyone's lives, this fucking phony rebellion – I don't understand. 
[01:20:00]  It is very hard, though, to gather up everything without your shoes on and then bring it somewhere  to sit down and put your shoes on.  I don't know, Jim.  That's pretty hard.  I can't be sure.  There's been times where I've stopped looking at my right dickhead, all right?  Put your cologne there, all right?  But literally, I fucking go through and it's like, who cares?  And I watch other people going through.  And you pick up your belongings and you get on the fucking plane.  Right.  And you know the guy next to you, there's no fucking piece of C4 strapped to his fucking 
[01:20:30]  bag.  I just don't understand where this TSA hatred comes from, other than the fact that it becomes  the thing you're supposed to hate.  Yes.  It's almost like a hack conspiracy point of view.  Ah, fucking TSA!  Break down to me how terrible they are.  If you don't want to go through the x-ray machine, you don't have to.  And if our government is this evil, wouldn't they take an Alex Jones out, if he has such  an inside scoop on everything?  You'd make him a martyr.  Come on. 
[01:21:00]  Can't make him a martyr?  Is that his explanation for that?  Yeah.  Why the government hasn't taken him out?  He's said many times, if I, you know, if anything happens to me, make sure you know  that the government did it.  So he's holding the evil government hostage?  Yes.  Yes.  They have to keep him alive?  Sure.  Exactly.  Absolutely.  I would just like to, when you think about that.  Can we get him on the line?  What has happened?  He'll talk to us today.  In my travels, and all these fucking cameras all around New York, it has affected me zero. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I don't, I just don't give a fuck.  And I'm not willing to give up my liberty.  I love my liberty.  Actually, I don't give a fuck about cameras anymore.  When it first started happening, of course, because it was new and different.  But now, I don't give a fuck.  Oh, they're lulling you into a sense of security.  And you know, I think it was at Bill Burr that raised the point about the Illuminati  and these cures for cancer and all this shit.  And you look at Steve Jobs and he died, he was 58. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Where, where, where, who are these fucking people that have all the, if Steve Jobs doesn't,  I think Burr raised that point.  Somebody did.  Yeah, probably Burr.  If he doesn't have access to that, who the fuck does?  They probably, he probably did something to piss him off.  Ah.  Yeah, there's always an excuse.  Yeah, he was onto something.  The best thing about conspiracy theorists are, you could always make a reason,  because it's all fabricated, so you could always fabricate a reason as to why  something is or isn't happening.  Like Alex Jones is, I guess what his, his whole thing is, 
[01:22:30]  they, they do these bombings and whatnot.  And terrorist events around the country.  Then they say that they are domestic and they're right-wing extremists.  And then you're able to put more, um, shit in place.  Shit in place.  Take away liberties.  To make it simple, right.  Take away more of your rights and liberties.  Take away your freedoms, yeah.  But meanwhile, they say it's right-wing extremists,  because the media just doesn't want to fucking say anything that might be wrong about foreign, 
[01:23:00]  and that's politically incorrect.  That's, that's all that is.  They'll just say, well, that's domestic terrorists, or it's, you know,  because they don't want to assume the wrong way.  Well, let's try to get Alex on the phone today.  Yeah.  To explain this further.  Because this is, this is a tape he made, I think, less than an hour when it all went down.  I think there's something new he might have to say.  Oh, I'm sure there will be.  He'll come on our show.  Yeah.  That's one thing I like about Alex is he will come on and talk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's for sure.  He doesn't shy away. 
[01:23:30]  Nope.  Cook.  He's a little nutty.  I love having him just go off.  Under the radar, why Boston Marathon bombs avoided detection?  Well, because everyone's walking around with backpacks yesterday.  Some kind of bag, something to hold their stuff for family members.  They're goods.  They're goods.  And, you know, Buck Sexton made a great point.  Everyone's just staring at the marathon route.  You could walk behind people easily in that situation.  They'll find out who it was, though. 
[01:24:00]  They're pretty fucking good with that shit.  It seems like the people that did this don't give a fuck if they're caught.  Well, it's kind of like the whole thing.  You kind of want them to know who it is.  Right.  If you're doing it, you're like, yeah.  Just hoping to try to get out of the fucking country, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Well, Alex Jones.  So that's what Alex Jones is saying today.  People are saying, why are you giving him more attention? 
[01:24:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Don't give him attention.  I like Alex.  He really grew on me.  I do like him.  I just think he's nuts.  I think it's like you said, though.  It's like some kind of a role-playing game.  It's like a web series.  He's putting out, like, webisodes of this weird, like, X-Files-ish thing.  Dennis Falcone has a theory on this whole thing, Sam?  Of course he does.  Is he here?  Yeah.  Oh, well, Dennis Falcone has to come down and, uh... 
[01:25:00]  We should also find out, how do you cover something like this?  Well, you've got to be upbeat for the audience and all that.  Like, how is the mash-up handling this?  Something like that.  They're on vacation, I think, right?  I think they're back today.  That's what?  Nicole went down and put on a bikini for two days and came back?  Yeah, she's just there for a long weekend.  Oh.  She was tweeting pictures of herself in a bikini.  I saw that.  Really?  Was it hot?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  Let me see.  Did she show her feet?  No.  That's what made it hot. 
[01:25:30]  Good thing.  Dennis Falcone's walking down the hall.  He's the oldies DJ.  He's a very traditional DJ.  Let's see.  Whoa.  Let me see.  Not bad.  She's posing, though.  She is posing.  She's really working that picture.  Clenching.  Oh, my God.  Left leg delicately bent.  Yep.  She's got it all figured out.  She knows where every part needs to be.  She's just glancing.  That's her glance.  Morning Miami glance.  All right.  I just got out of bed and threw my bikini.  No, you didn't. 
[01:26:00]  Meanwhile, her foot's hanging off the balcony and dangling in front of somebody's window.  What is that?  I think a lizard's trying to get into our room.  It's sunning on her foot.  Throw those giant stucco-eating snails.  DennisFalcone.com is in studio.  Is Mike hot here?  Yes.  The mic is hot.  That's a catchphrase.  Is that your catchphrase?  How are you feeling, Anthony?  How are you doing?  You know, my voice is shot, Dennis. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Yes, very nice.  You like the bikini picture?  What's that, my friend?  Is that what you were saying very nice about?  Yes, a young lady.  You enjoy a good bikini pic?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  You and E-Rock.  E-Rock loves him.  He's in there all the time downloading Bikini Girls.  That's right.  He fapped to that.  Nothing wrong with that.  When he does it during work hours.  He was fapping.  Dennis Falcone.  So it's a tough day for radio guys.  How do you handle a big event like this? 
[01:27:00]  Now, a talk show, obviously, you're talking about the news and whatnot.  But a music show, what do you do when there's been such a tragedy like we got in Boston?  Keep it going because the music show has to be the release.  You know, when people are kind of headed up to here with all the news reports, basically  it's the same thing being rehashed and rehashed.  Do you acknowledge it on the show?  Sure.  You cross-promote to your other channels.  In what way?  In an area like us.  You could say, you know, to follow this.  You could either get in on the conversation on our POTUS channel or listen to Fox News or  CNBC or CNN. 
[01:27:30]  Gotcha.  You know, and if you want to release, if you want to hear something, you know, we've got  country music for you.  We've got rock and jazz and blues.  Would it be prudent to play a Boston song?  A song from the band Boston?  That would be kind of silly.  Would it?  Yeah, sure.  Well, what song would you play?  Please Come to Boston by Dave Loggins.  Oh, well, there you go.  You don't want to shy people away from going to Boston.  Or the dropkick Murphys, maybe.  Yeah.  I think people will stay away from Boston for at least a couple days. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, a couple days.  I don't think it's their first thought, let's go to Boston.  Let's go to Boston right now.  Although last night it looked like traffic was flowing up on that street when I was watching  Sean Hannity for a while.  What do you mean flowing?  They opened up Boylston?  No.  There's no way they opened up Boylston.  What are you talking about?  Right in the back.  I mean, it looked like traffic was flowing down one of the streets, not too far from there.  Well, you've got Newbury's, the parallel street to Boylston.  I'm not too familiar with the geographic outlay of Boston.  No, I think they've got the area pretty shut down right now. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But back in the day when President Kennedy was assassinated, I remember listening to  WABC, and they played somber music, like very beautiful music, chamber music.  Wait, JFK?  How old are you?  What's that?  How old are you?  Double Nichols, 55.  Double Nichols.  Right.  But JFK, how old were you?  Five.  And you remember this?  Yeah.  I guess you really wanted to get into radio.  First grade.  Where were you when you heard it?  I was in school, and I was in the first grade, and I was in parochial school, and the nun came 
[01:29:00]  in and said, there's been a terrible tragedy.  Your friend, because he was Roman Catholic, they used to call him your friend.  The president has been shot.  He's a dear friend of ours.  He's a dear friend of ours.  We went home.  You know, you went home, and you only had the six channels back then, and the word I always  remember was the rotunda, you know, when they had TV.  And I remember seeing, you know, Ruby get shot. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You know, cartoons weren't on.  They weren't playing any cartoons, you know?  No, no, huh?  Popeye and the Little Rascals and, you know, Laurel and Hardy were not going to get shot.  At five, he's watching the news.  Ruby didn't get shot.  Yeah.  When Ruby shot out.  He was meant to be in this business.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I definitely remember that, you know, putting on the radio and hearing it.  You forget that your cartoons were mixed in with the news and everything else.  Yeah.  You didn't have, like, it wasn't all niche.  No, there was no cartoon network.  No, none of that shit. 
[01:30:00]  You had your local channels and your network channels, and that was it.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a somber day.  So what's your thoughts on Boston?  Who did this, Dennis Falcone?  Do you think it was a hate group because you always have a large population of, I guess,  African-Americans and people from other parts of the world running?  No, I don't think so.  I think the, um, I think the, uh.  There's way more white people that run the Boston Marathon than.  Again, this is just a disc jockey's observation.  Wow, you were ready to.  It's not a newsman. 
[01:30:30]  I'm just throwing it out there.  The Boston Marathon in general is a very white event.  So you're saying white.  I mean, the lead runners.  Well, I always.  The lead runners is a pack of guys that have a chance of winning the thing,  and that's maybe 10 to 12 guys.  And then the rest of them are just white guys and white, uh, white gals.  Well, hate group.  Yeah.  Al Qaeda.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  Yes, I do.  But you were thinking white supremacists?  Possibly.  Possibly.  Because nobody has really taken, um, taken a claim to this.  Maybe because there wasn't enough deaths.  You think they might be disappointed and they're not taking, um. 
[01:31:00]  Not possibly.  Maybe it didn't go off the way they expected it to go off.  Wow.  He's got some theories I haven't even heard yet.  No, I mean, they, you know, it did its job.  Everyone's, uh, fearful today.  I know there was, uh, there was probably some, a couple of races now around the country, right?  And as you started getting into springtime.  Well, you got the London Marathon this weekend, Dennis Falcons.  So there's a lot of, uh, focus on the London Marathon and what they could do just in case,  you know, there's a one-two punch.  Sure.  That's a good thing.  I'm reading over here.  Um, people think Dennis doesn't want to alienate the Muslim listeners. 
[01:31:30]  The Muslim listeners.  I don't know.  I haven't gotten too many emails from Muslim listeners.  No?  I, I, it could be anybody.  I mean, hey, there's a lot of nuts in the world.  Well, that's true.  A lot of nuts in the world.  How would you talk in between the records about this?  Keep it here.  We'll keep you updated on any developments happening in Boston.  As, uh, you know, as they come in, we'll pass them along to you.  But in the meantime and in between time, let's keep running on empty with Jackson Brown talking  about running.  You know, play some running music or, you know.  You don't play running music today. 
[01:32:00]  Sure you do.  You keep, you know, you look, life has to go on, your business has to go on.  For most of our careers, we've been known as shock jocks.  And we even know you just don't play running music today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That might be a little insensitive.  Running on empty?  That's horrific.  You're kind of.  That could be the worst song to play today.  You're almost taking the event and kind of making it about something insignificant.  Right.  An empty that has a significance.  Running on empty?  I don't know, Dennis.  Just a, you know, running song.  Well, what, do you know any other running songs?  Maybe, I'll work with you a little bit. 
[01:32:30]  Maybe we can find a running song that's appropriate.  Run to the Hills?  Run to the Hills.  There's a good song by the new beats called Run Baby Run back in the 60s.  Okay.  Good song.  But then the first.  Run Away, Del Shannon.  Run Away, you're running away from bomb.  All right, you're asking me to running songs here.  Right.  Run Baby Run, that's also like you're running for your life.  Anything with running today means I'm running for my life.  Run Joey Run.  Run for your life, the Beatles.  The do, run, run, run.  The do, run, run. 
[01:33:00]  How does it run for your life?  The Beatles song.  How does that one go?  Run for your life if you can, little girl.  All right, right, okay.  All right.  Good song.  There's a lot of things, but, you know, I mean, you have to, you know, business has to  go on.  I know in Boston, I mean, a lot of the different radio stations there are, you know, covering  it a lot differently.  You know, but it's the same thing.  Because they're close to the situation.  Sure.  Supposedly, our pals, Toucher and Rich there, one of them, I think the Rich guy, lives in  the building where the bomb went off.  Oh, wow.  Outside that building.  Is he okay?  The bomb went off. 
[01:33:30]  I've heard that a few times this morning.  No, it's a sad thing.  People go out for a great event like that.  Patriots Day.  Had the Red Sox.  Patriots Day.  Tax Day.  You got the Red Sox playing.  You got the Marathons.  Everybody was wearing number 42 yesterday in baseball.  For Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson.  What was his birthday or his anniversary of his...  No, that was the day that he broke into Major League Baseball.  So everyone wears 42.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I bet you A-Rod would refuse.  He probably would be the only one that says, no, I'm not doing that. 
[01:34:00]  And the only guy still wearing, of course, Mariano.  Is Mariano the only guy who still has that number?  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  I think the last guy before...  I remember Butch Husky from the Mets also wore that number.  And why won't he move on from 42?  When he retires, they're going to retire.  Oh, yeah.  But why wouldn't he do the right thing and go, all right, you know what?  This isn't my number anymore.  He is doing the right thing.  He's a super...  They're all superstitious nuts.  Right.  And once they have a number and what Rivera has done, he can have number three if he wants  it from fucking Babe Ruth.  And he might have had a conversation with Rachel Robinson.  I didn't know he was the last guy. 
[01:34:30]  You know, Jackie's widow, who's a very nice woman.  And she's going to be understanding, but she's probably thinking, what a fucking asshole.  How about you give up 42 for my husband?  That's my man.  Yeah.  Right.  Who fucking broke the barrier for so many athletes in so many sports.  Last of the 42s.  I don't think he's...  I don't think she's understanding.  Okay.  She probably was to his face, but behind closed doors, she's like, she's a fucking asshole.  Well, they just never gave out the number anymore.  No, I understand.  I didn't realize he was the only one. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, he was the only one still wearing the 42.  Yeah.  Well, Dennis Falcone, a great angle in this whole thing.  A somber Tuesday.  It is a somber Tuesday.  Do we go with somber music?  No.  No.  You have to keep going.  I mean, you have to...  You know, there are a lot of places to get that...  And sometimes people need the release.  That's why even after 9-11, you know, they said, you know, let's...  We're going to have football this weekend.  And, you know, back when Kennedy was killed, they canceled the NFL that weekend. 
[01:35:30]  That's right, they did.  Oh, did they?  Yes, they did.  So, you know, I mean, each situation has to be, you know, measured.  And, you know, what the impact is.  And we can't live in fear, right, Dennis Falcone?  Can't live in fear, because then they win.  That old gag.  And they win.  Maybe there's a can't live in fear song.  Tears for fears.  Can't live in fear.  Can't live in fear.  Don't be afraid.  We'll have to dig into the hard drive of hits and see what we can come up with for you.  Hey, I was on the 60s last night.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it was on the 60s channel. 
[01:36:00]  Great, I had a blast.  Reliving the past.  It was a lot of fun.  Why are you saying blast?  That's not true.  Because it was a past.  Because it was a lot of pro.  Why couldn't you say I had fun?  I had a good time.  You didn't say I had a blast.  Come on.  You can't do that.  You're a shock jock.  I think you're more of a shock jock.  No, no, no.  I had a blast.  My God, that's crazy.  It's a piece of shit thing to say.  It wasn't meant like that.  Yeah, we know it was.  It wasn't meant like that.  That's part of the vernacular when you're... 
[01:36:30]  God damn it.  Who were you filling in for?  Who was on last night?  Terry Motormouth Young.  Ah.  You're starting to get more shifts because of the popularity we've given you?  Time off for good behavior.  Yeah, I fill in from time to time.  So if they need me, I'm here.  He gets so excited.  He pulled me over to his desk the other day and he goes, Sam, come here.  I go, what's up, Dennis?  And he goes, the night guy on the 50s channel.  60s?  He has cancer.  He called out. 
[01:37:00]  I was prepared.  Nice.  Okay, great.  You were prepared to go in.  You're like a first responder.  Just sitting there, just waiting for the call.  What do you think of the Islanders' chances in the playoffs?  Oh, that was a tough Saturday night, losing to the Rangers in that one-nothing.  It was an amazing game, though.  Great game.  Great game.  Won nothing.  Yeah, it was a tough game.  Rangers got him in overtime.  It was 0-0 after regulation.  Yeah, it's coming down to the wire, and we've got all the games for you here on SiriusXM.  You can't have a normal conversation. 
[01:37:30]  Find out where your team will be playing.  Everything has to spin back toward cross-promoting.  That's what Troy doesn't like.  No, I'm looking forward.  I see Troy in the bathroom.  I go the other way.  Oh, do you?  That's his beast.  Oh, you go the other way, huh?  Well, I don't mean to pass.  You go to the store at the hall and the hall and the hall and the hall and the hall.  Don't worry, hold John.  You're accepting that Troy doesn't like you?  No, he's a good guy.  We get along.  He invited me in last week.  He said, come on in and have a hamburger.  I said, that was very nice.  Where were the hamburgers?  Oh, over here?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  I forgot about Hamburger Day already.  We had fun. 
[01:38:00]  Three-day, more than 140 hurt.  Just got a refresh on the news site.  I'm on and nothing new.  Hunt is on for Boston bombing clothes.  That's all they got right now.  They're all hoping to get that next nugget information.  Oh, yeah.  The next nugget info.  They're hunting for it.  And you're making jokes, Dennis.  I'm not making jokes.  I've always used that line on the air.  Had a blast.  Relive in the past.  Stop.  Fun line.  That's not a hurtful line.  Stop saying that.  Not a hurtful line.  It's just insensitive at this time. 
[01:38:30]  No, I don't think so.  It kind of is.  No, I don't think so.  It kind of is.  It's fun.  What song would you play for everybody if you had the ultimate choice?  A lot of people.  Ultimate choice?  Got a lot of ears right now.  People are feeling a little strange and weird and scared and fearful today.  And you could bring them all together with one song.  How would you do it?  Eye of the Tiger.  What?  Nice uplifting song.  It's another running song.  It's a classic running song. 
[01:39:00]  Dent, dent, dent.  One shot.  One shot.  And this is what you would give the people?  This is good.  Wait, wait, wait.  Pause.  Hold on.  Pause.  Let's see how he would fucking ramp this up.  Maybe there's a way he ramps it up that makes it make sense.  That's why they won't put him on the air.  This is the one song.  Everyone's counting on you.  You're the big fucking boss jock in Boston.  Do Eye of the Tiger?  Yeah.  I mean, that's a nice uplifting song.  All right.  Speak from your heart.  Here we go.  It's an uplifting song. 
[01:39:30]  Well, sad thing happened in Boston.  But they've tried to keep us down before here in this great country of ours.  And you know what?  It's not going to stop now.  We're too strong.  As everybody gets together and we stand behind this, as we did 9-11 and tragedies after that.  So you know what?  You just keep it here.  Keep the faith and keep believing.  And you'll always have the Eye of the Tiger behind you.  This is Survivor here on SiriusXM on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Have yourself a great morning.  We'll keep you updated on what's going on in the news.  Oh, you went for that ramp.  I saw you ramp. 
[01:40:00]  That was good.  You didn't want to go to the vocals, but there was a ramp there.  No, there's too much talk here.  There's too much talk here.  Yeah.  That was good.  Did you hear this song?  No.  It's pretty good.  Never heard this.  How about Don't Try to Me?  Metallica.  Don't try to me.  Why won't you be a little more aggressive?  This is a long intro, boy.  You get through fucking weather, traffic.  Community bulletin board.  Community bulletin board.  This is a song that is really cool when you're alone, and if you drive by somebody, you roll  your windows up so they don't see you douchely enjoying this song. 
[01:40:30]  I like this song.  I do, too, but you never want anyone to know you like Eye of the Tiger.  I don't know if it's appropriate to play today, but I do like it.  It's a good song.  Fucking Rocky III, motherfucker.  Yep.  Definitely not appropriate today.  I've really done nothing appropriate this morning.  This is the one where Rocky didn't think he could win.  He lost confidence.  Right.  And until Adrian, like, backed him and was in his corner, so to speak, he didn't have it. 
[01:41:00]  But then she wanted him to win and go out there and do it after some type of personal tragedy.  And you know what?  He went in there and, all right, turn the radio off.  Got a spoiler.  All right, good.  He won.  He won that fight against Clubber Lang.  Holy fuck.  He beat Clubber Lang.  Is it amazing?  They frolicked on the beach.  Dude, that scene is so gay. 
[01:41:30]  When him and Apollo Creed are running, Apollo Creed's got this short, cut-off, bippy top he's wearing.  He's wearing like a halter top.  It was the style back then.  And then he's running down the beach.  And finally, finally Rocky's got that drive, the Eye of the Tiger.  And he beats Apollo on the beach in that little race.  And they jump in the water.  I know.  And start slow motion jumping and hugging and splashing in the water.  Frolicking.  I call it frolicking.  They were frolicking in the water.  It could be. 
[01:42:00]  It's rough.  It's the gayest part.  Worse than a volleyball scene in Top Gun?  Very close.  Very close.  Hold on a minute.  There it is.  If someone has a problem with Dennis Falcone, pause that so we can see it.  But first, Frank in Maryland.  Frank.  Yeah, I got some information for the DJ in the bullpen.  Dennis Falcone.  Yes.  The NFL did play.  The weekend JFK got a sad day.  All right.  Roselle said that was the biggest mistake he made by not canceling the games.  You're right.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you're right.  He said he should have.  Yes.  I'm going to correct the DJ in the bullpen.  Yes, you're right. 
[01:42:30]  The DJ in the bullpen.  Thanks, Frank.  I've got to admit you're wrong.  That's right.  Roselle always said that was the biggest mistake he made by not canceling the games.  You've got to move on, right?  Yeah.  Or the terrorists win.  We all know that.  Yeah, yeah.  Are the Red Sox playing today?  Did anybody...  I think they might have canceled today as well.  Yeah.  Just because, like Anne said, because I was a little confused by the security people and  everything.  Yeah, man.  They're using all their resources for the investigation.  Yeah.  I believe they're canceling the Red Sox game today.  Yeah, plus they probably also don't want a lot of people driving around to the area. 
[01:43:00]  Well, perhaps.  Yeah.  Yeah, perhaps.  Yeah, they've got to still check out everything.  Let's see the...  I've got to see this.  Is there sound on that?  Yeah, it's at the end of their sprint down the beach.  We're near the end here.  Yeah.  Full screen.  Oh, yeah.  The action music.  Rocky wins.  Now, like, they jump in the water with their sneakers on?  Yeah.  Damn.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  And they're hugging.  They're hugging and touching each other.  Clapping.  Oh, my God.  This is...  Why are they doing this?  Oh.  All right.  I don't know.  You like that, Dennis?  How many times...  Fucking garden hose artery and fucking Sly's arm.  How many times have you seen Stallone looking up with his mouth, like, in a rage?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  They knew how to bring on the shivers in your body, though. 
[01:44:00]  Those movies.  Dang.  When they fucking ding.  And the music.  And the music.  Holy fuck.  I like the one when Adrian came out of the coma and then just...  You probably liked it when she fell onto the feet bag.  She said, win, Rocky.  Win.  Ah, that was...  That was good.  The music spoiled.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah, that was very good.  Yeah, yeah.  Rocky 2 was great.  I liked Rocky 2.  I liked Rocky 3.  I liked the Clubber Lang one.  Me too.  Oh, that's a great one.  Yeah.  After that, right down the toilet.  I must break you. 
[01:44:30]  I must break...  If we can do it here.  If we can do it here...  Oh, remember that speech?  We've broken down that speech as well.  Working out with the big logs.  The big...  Well, yeah.  In the middle of nowhere, you had to find shit to lift.  With that log.  I don't know that.  Yeah.  Till I work out.  Dennis Falcone, how about one more shot before we say goodbye to you today?  All of Boston's counting on you.  One song.  I don't know if I have the Tigers.  All right, all right.  Well, let's brainstorm here.  Let's have a little morning show meeting.  A little get-together here. 
[01:45:00]  What could we...  It's up to you, man.  Morning show what?  You know way more songs than I...  Than I do than any of us do.  Theme from Rocky.  Oh, wow.  But that's an instrumental.  What do you got?  It's a great song.  We need a song that just...  Fuck the Rocky on the brain.  We need a song that just brings everyone together.  Brings Boston together.  Happy birthday.  No, we don't want to play Lee Greenwood.  God bless the USA.  We used that 9-11.  That brought everything back.  How about you, Sam?  You got any good songs for us here?  No help from us, Dennis. 
[01:45:30]  No, we need no help from you.  Come on.  You guys, you're a professional.  You're a veteran.  Something.  How about Disco Duck?  It's funny.  You're a veteran of the Thousand Psychic Wars.  Trying to come up with a good song to keep everybody on the...  Let's see here.  What...  How about the listeners?  Are they chiming in on there?  Or anything that's helping us out?  It's really up to you, Dan.  It's all up to you.  I don't even have the hard drive of hits that I could scan right now.  The pressure's on.  I understand the pressure's on, but, you know, sometimes you're in a tough spot as a radio guy. 
[01:46:00]  Well, let's see.  The other song is...  It's winding down.  You know?  You're looking at the counter.  It's winding down.  You need another song.  I feel like I'm living a radio fucking nightmare.  Yeah, it is.  Why?  It's like when you wake up and you always have that dream of dead air.  We know.  The song's ending and you can't pick the next one.  That's why we're referencing this day.  Oh, the slow clap.  Never...  Yeah, never...  Let me see.  Never Give You Up.  Never Surrender.  What was Never Surrender?  That was Corey Hart.  No.  That was Never Surrender. 
[01:46:30]  You know that song?  Never Surrender.  All right, let's see.  I remember Corey Hart, yes.  Don't Stop.  That was Fleetwood Mac.  We don't want to use that one.  No.  No, no, no.  Don't Stop.  Did Bill Clinton use that song as his campaign theme?  Well, there are suggestions coming in, Dennis.  Sweet Caroline is coming in.  So good.  Dirty Water by the Stendells.  Good song.  Oh, Boston, you're my home.  Yeah, written by Ed Cobb of the Four Preps.  A lot of people say in the Stendells, Dirty Water would be the song. 
[01:47:00]  I hate that song.  It's terrible.  You don't like that song?  No.  Never liked it?  No, never liked it.  Down by the river, Charles.  I hate that song.  It's a good song.  I hate it, huh?  It's a good song.  No, it's really not.  You really don't like that one?  Coming up with a song here.  Boston loves that song.  Boston loves it.  That's probably their number one hometown song up there.  Yeah, so let's play it for them.  You didn't really come up with that one.  No, I know I didn't come up, but I asked for the listeners' help.  Yeah, but you're supposed to do this.  Sam's right.  That is true.  Sam's right. 
[01:47:30]  Sam is right.  Why is it that so many people came up with Dirty Water by the Stendells?  Well, because that was obvious.  But the veteran radio guy did not.  Well, that was obvious.  I mean, I was trying to look beyond that.  I'm trying to look past the forest to see the trees or something.  Is that the one that they use?  Just look through the trees to find a song.  Look through the trees.  Let's see.  How about something by the Beach Boys?  Can we get something by the Beach Boys?  There's a nice Good Time song there.  Good Time song.  Oh, yeah, Good Times.  To make people feel a little better.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  We don't want to play I Feel Good by James Brown.  How about Come Together by the Beatles?  That's coming in.  Yeah.  That's a good one, too, from the Abbey Road album.  But these are all songs you're not coming up with.  No, I'm not coming up with a song.  Do you want me to go back to my desk and do some show prep on this?  Oh, jeez.  Well, the song needs to come on in two minutes.  I mean, it's next.  You don't have time to go back to your desk.  What's the Beach Boys song you like, Sam?  God Only Knows.  That's a great song.  It's a great song.  It's a love song.  It really is a love song.  It's a love song.  It's an incredible song.  Let's see.  I'm trying to come up with something.  I'm trying to.  I'm really digging deep here into. 
[01:48:30]  Don Wicklund.  How about More Than a Feeling by Boston?  We said Boston.  I know.  We said Rock and Roll Band by Boston.  I guess I just woke up.  How about some Scorch because of Sibby and he was in Boston?  Did you see the picture?  There's a picture somebody sent that was in the audience of Scorch's show.  There's no one there.  No.  Oh, really?  There's no one.  I don't want to know.  Yeah.  I don't want to.  There's no one there.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  It's fantastic. 
[01:49:00]  They're tearing down the fourth wall of the whole thing.  Yes.  That's great.  I want to believe, like, Scorch.  No.  That he's a big star.  Yeah.  Fuck.  There it is.  Turn that seven.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  They're fucking round cafeteria tables.  Yeah.  And there's three people.  Shucks.  Holy shit.  Is that from the back of the room, you think?  Yeah.  I think so.  Wow.  He's in his chair.  The pan's up there.  And there's three people.  You don't have tables. 
[01:49:30]  We might have to do Scorch Day today, because it's just a strange day.  And I know there's a new episode out there.  People let me in on that.  You can play Thundercast 65.  Rob Zombie is from Massachusetts.  From Framingham.  Yeah.  Zombie's coming in today, too.  Rob Zombie.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Hmm.  I'm not familiar with that song, but if you believe it.  If you don't know Thundercast 65, it's not on the hard drive.  I'll have to make sure that you want suggestions from the audience.  All right.  I have no idea what these guys are going to say.  Let's say hi to Brad.  We got DennisFalcone.com in studio.  Brad. 
[01:50:00]  How about I'm TNT by ACDC?  Oh, no.  It's right up your alley.  That's terrible.  That's not funny at all, sir.  We didn't want to.  He's just punching out.  All right.  That's cool.  Dennis.  Good vibrations.  Beach Boys always a nice song.  No, it's not good vibrations.  It's good vibrations.  Because you're feeling a good vibration, you want to bring people together.  You want to stay away from blast, running, and vibrations.  I'm not looking at it that way.  People explode, Dennis.  Yeah, but everyone else would look at it.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:50:30]  You're looking at it way too deep.  You think good vibrations would fly today?  Why windows blast out?  Because of vibrations.  Oh.  Dennis, so insensitive.  Stay away from that shit.  They were talking about love vibrations because it was a different thing back in the 60s.  But, you know, if someone hears good vibrations on the radio, they're calling in and saying,  how dare you?  Yeah.  God damn it.  Dennis Falcone must be back on the air offending people.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm not offending people.  Shock jock.  Because you guys are looking at it way, way too deep.  Or as my three-year-old would say, are you kidding me? 
[01:51:00]  How dare you?  How dare you?  Oh, how dare you?  The other one I remembered after the show is, are you kidding me?  Did it ever annoy you when he said that?  Oh, my God.  I kind of laugh.  That's what I do laugh.  It's funny.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not.  This is for your own good.  No, I don't want to come up.  So good vibrations is a bad one, too.  How dare you?  That's a bad one, too.  You're falling apart in front of us.  Everyone's counting on you.  Come on, Dennis.  I'm trying to come up with something good.  I mean, what's that? 
[01:51:30]  What does that have to do with bringing people together?  Just saying, you'd rather be surfing right now, right?  Well, we could, I know, 1969, the Youngbloods get together.  Nothing with blood.  It doesn't really happen.  That's the name of the group, because it's drunk.  The guy's name is Jesse Collin Young.  But you don't want blood.  I just want the song Get Together.  That's insensitive.  The song is Get Together.  The song is Get Together.  They're talking about the fact that one of the victims is eight years old.  That's so sad.  The song is Get Together.  You want to play a song by a band called Youngblood? 
[01:52:00]  What the fuck?  Now you're just being a shock jock.  Shit.  Jesse Collin Young.  You're a shock jock.  His group is called the Youngbloods.  That's all.  You don't want to mention blood.  You don't want to mention bombs.  It's a great song.  You don't want to mention Get Together, really?  Yeah.  Come on, everybody.  Get Together.  That's what it was.  It was a get together.  That was Get Together.  Because people are falling apart.  Come together.  You guys are missing it.  You don't know how many people lost limbs yesterday?  You want to play a song called Get Together?  It's terrible. 
[01:52:30]  What the fuck, man?  I'm looking at it from a positive, happy, tough spot.  I understand.  But you can't have a group called Youngblood.  You can't have Get Together.  You can't have good vibrations.  You can't have anything with...  You wanted running on empty as your first suggestion.  Might as well use Kokomo, then, for that matter.  I mean, we're trying to come up with something happy here, something positive.  I mean, I appreciate you at least trying to figure it out.  I'm trying to.  I'm trying to.  Yes, I'm failing miserably. 
[01:53:00]  Because I wasn't given enough time to do any show prep.  Youngblood, really?  The show prep.  Get Together is a good song.  Your instinct is to offend.  Do you know the song?  Don't play the song, Eric.  People get pissed off.  No, we need a new song.  Get Together.  We do?  Yeah.  All right.  We're saying no to Youngblood.  Get Together.  So you're saying no to that.  And then we start thinking of groups.  Let's see.  So you think of, do the Beatles have anything?  They've come together.  I said we're getting away from putting things back together.  Well, we have to put things back together.  A lot of people lost limbs yesterday.  You have to put things back together. 
[01:53:30]  Well, of course.  They've got no leg, but we're not addressing that right now.  Right.  We all understand how horrific the injuries were yesterday.  How about Love Train?  OJs.  Can we ride the Love Train?  That makes people feel good.  OJ.  Another American Tragedy.  The OJs.  Now, OJ.  That's what you want to bring up.  The OJs.  Named after the Cleveland disc jockey, Eddie OJ.  He named the group, The OJs.  I don't know about that.  Yes.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that either.  A little trivia right there.  I knew that.  From The OJs. 
[01:54:00]  You knew that, too?  Yeah.  They have a bunch of good songs in there, too.  Look up something about The OJs.  I've got a lot of pussy-telling girls that.  They have a bunch of great songs that we could use.  I don't know if that's the time.  Now you're just bailing out.  No, I'm not bailing out.  It's a song that has nothing to do with bringing people.  I don't want to say the word, but, you know.  Let's just say getting everyone on the same page this morning.  That's what the OJs song does.  Love Train.  Might as well play Surf and Safari.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  You guys are just shooting down everything I'm coming up with here.  Well, you had some rough songs that you suggested.  With throwing out ideas.  It was a brainstorming session.  You're the guy that came up with running on empty.  Throwing.  Good Vibrations.  And Youngblood.  What the fuck?  No.  No, you guys are just shooting everything down that I come up with.  That don't make no sense.  That's right, Chip.  Chip's right on this one, Dennis.  The OJs also had another one.  Put your hands together.  That's a great one, too.  Jesus.  Put your hands together because you've got to get people together. 
[01:55:00]  Of course.  That would be great if you have two hands this morning.  That's terrible.  What the fuck?  People lost hands, man.  I'm just...  But it's something that you just want to tell people to, hey, relax.  Everything is going to be fine if we all work together.  But what happens to people listening to you and being like, I can't put my hands together  because I don't have them anymore?  Jesus.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  No songs about limbs.  Please.  Yes.  Yeah.  Keep the limbs out of this.  No songs about limbs.  What are you going to suggest next? 
[01:55:30]  Fucking ZZ Top song?  Oh, yeah.  He would.  Did you say that?  I didn't say that.  We want to make sure you don't say that.  You would.  I'm not going to say Sharp Dressed Man.  We're on to you.  All right.  We're on to you.  You're on to me here.  I'm trying to come up with some songs, but you should have given me a little...  He's trying to offend people on the sly.  I don't want to offend anybody.  That's not my bag.  Oh, it's your bag.  That's not what I do.  All right.  That's not what I do.  How about Living in America?  James Brown.  That's a great song.  That's a great one. 
[01:56:00]  It brings people together.  All right?  That's a safe choice.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  You're going with safe choices now.  Well, I'm going the other way, and you're yelling at me.  And that's...  Well, you went way the other way, and now you're going way the other way over here now.  All right.  So we've got to bring it back up to the middle.  Are we playing the Rocky soundtrack today, or are we doing a show?  It's either over-the-top outrageous, or it's way over-the-top outrageous means nothing to anyone.  I wasn't trying to be over-the-top outrageous.  You sure?  I was not trying to be over-the-top.  And I'm not trying to offend anybody.  I'm not offending anybody. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Maybe surfing safari is the way to go.  Last chance.  I don't think so.  Because we've got to move on.  Yeah.  Do you have a song to bring everyone onto the same page?  How about E-Rock?  Do you have a song?  No.  It's up to you.  I'm asking for his help.  You're the boss jock.  You're the big DJ.  I'm not the big dean of the DJs here.  I'm trying to come up with something that people might say, hey, this is nice.  Yeah.  Let's see.  How about maybe something by Elvis?  If I Could Dream is a nice song. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, Elvis.  It's a nice song, which makes people feel a little bit better, because if you could dream  of a better world, that might be a nice song.  Sam Cooke, A Change is Gonna Come, which was a song about the civil rights movement and things  back in the mid-1960s.  A great song as well.  Did I just send Anthony into a depression?  I'm trying to think of something positive and something that's going to make people feel  good about themselves.  Oh, yeah, right. 
[01:57:30]  Let's just play the Stendells.  Yeah.  Might as well.  I think that's the best song that we could play this morning.  Sure.  Yeah, but you didn't suggest it.  Okay, so we turned it to a listener.  So you turn it back to the listener, and you make the listener feel good about themselves.  Dan Ingram's would have had a song.  You know that, right?  Okay.  He would have had a song.  He would have.  Absolutely.  He would have.  He would have had it well thought out.  He's a legend.  It would have been one of those songs where everyone had that wow moment.  Like, holy fuck, that's why I listen to Dan Ingram.  Okay.  My God, he just knows what to do.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm trying to help, but you asked for my help, and you come in here, and you destroy me. 
[01:58:00]  You put me down.  You came in here.  We were already here.  Yeah, exactly.  You marched in.  I didn't march in.  They said jokes.  They said the guys want to talk to you.  How dare you?  They said the guys want to talk to you about this.  You marched in with your jokes and your offensive comments.  True.  All right.  We'll be back.  We got Rob Zombie coming in a little bit.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll certainly, we might, I think we should go to the phones today, see what everyone's  saying about the events that occurred in Baltimore.  There's a lot of people on hold. 
[01:58:30]  They want to talk about me being in Baltimore this Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Guys, not now.  I mean, if you want to go to McGooby's, I'll be there, but it's not about me.  Oh, you got a Thursday show, you said?  I do, yes.  So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, for this run of Voldemort, go see Jim Norton.  Wait, it's only Friday, Saturday?  Four shows.  Oh, Friday, Saturday.  I'm not there, Thursday?  No.  Oh?  Was I supposed to be?  No.  What a dummy I am.  What happened there, Jimmy?  I just got a fucking heart on.  Can't you just save me a show? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, and cost me money.  Oh, no.  I got a raise.  I got a fucking raise.  Yes, you did, Jim Norton.  Fucking cocksucker.  All right, well, uh.  I got to make pay pay.  Fuck yeah, I got to go piss.  Pick us out, slobo.  You just don't want to hear this song, Ant.  No.  Where the fuck are you going?  It's Boston's song.  Cocksucker.  It's Boston's song.  Just let's play it.  Let's not even.  Nah, fuck him.  I like him doing shit.  He's in there drawing tits on himself, cocksucker. 
[01:59:30]  Thank you, DennisValcone.com.  Thank you.  Hold on a second.  I don't want to offend anyone this morning.  I know.  I ain't ready for this.  You talked over the.  Yeah, you fucked it up, Eric.  Stop, stop.  Put it back, I'd say.  You guys were all yelling at me as we're, as the song is playing.  You're in here fucking around.  We weren't yelling at you.  Yeah, we were having a little fun with you.  Yeah, what the fuck?  What the fuck, dude?  I'm a sensitive person here, you know?  Are you?  All right.  Fucking ramp this one up for us.  It's a quick one.  Yeah, fucking ramp it up.  Go ahead, Dennis.  Shit.  On the Obi and Anthony show, Dennis Falcone. 
[02:00:00]  Sorry if I offended anybody, especially you.  In Boston, here are the Standellas.  I'm going to tell you a story.  I'm going to tell you about my town.  I'm going to tell you a big, fat story, baby.  It's all about my town.  Yeah, down by the river.  Down by the banks of the river, Charles.  Oh, that's what's happening, baby.  Oh, that's where you'll find me. 
[02:00:30]  Along with lovers and bugs and thieves.  Oh, but they're cool people.  Well, I love that dirty water.  Oh, Boston, you're my home.  Oh, you're the number one place. 
[02:01:00]  Frustrated women.  I mean, frustrated.  Have to be in by 12 o'clock.  Oh, that's a shame.  But I'm wishing and hoping.  Oh, that just was those doors one hop.  I like to stay time with my feet and walk around.  But I love that dirty water. 
[02:01:30]  I'll Boston, you're my home.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  I love it.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  Oh, yeah.  Cause I love that dirty water 
[02:02:00]  Oh, Boston, you're my home  Oh, yeah  Well, I love that dirty water  I love a baby, love that dirty water  I love Boston, love that dirty water  I'm the strangler, love that dirty water

[02:03:00]  This is the Orpian Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  A marriage is...  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business, it's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich,  and the other person is spelling all the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it. 
[02:03:30]  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with, like, casually loving touching?  Well, because I know he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't...  Like, hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie. 
[02:04:00]  And rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted.  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I've seen that a whole thing.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem. 
[02:04:30]  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  You're going to need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.  From a qualified professional.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  New from the Hiv Corporation.  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Sensitivity training.  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in, and they can tickle my bag a little.  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area.  And then they can leave.  Jim will help you construct a business plan.  Greed is good.  He'll guide you through the hiring process. 
[02:05:00]  Hire all fat chicks if you don't want them harassed.  He's also a whiz at customer relations.  Here's what you do, stupid.  When they complain, you go, click.  You take the phone.  Click.  Ladies will also enjoy Jim's wardrobe recommendations.  You send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the workday.  Jim is also an experienced marriage counselor.  How could you marry a chick that won't drink out of your mule?  And he can help mend even the most fractured of family relationships.  I killed my wife with a hammer.  And he'll also assist with time management. 
[02:05:30]  130, Human Resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  135, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor.  End of meeting.  Call 1-800-LOG-DROP for the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook.  Order today.  Meeting adjourned.  The O.P. Anthony Show continues. 
[02:06:00]  Good choice.  Got Rob Zombie coming in today.  Yep.  And because of that, we invited Tom Papa in.  We don't need a reason to have Tom Papa in the studio.  But Tom was just in and we're like, he'd love to come back and talk to Rob, I'm sure, because they're friends.  We thought it would be a good idea.  And I was asking Tom Papa, oh, they're blurring out the guy's leg in that picture that we've all seen.  What are they doing?  But that's why the internet is so much...  Right.  Why, you want to see it?  We all saw it.  So what's the difference in this point? 
[02:06:30]  I want to unsee it.  Yeah, I definitely want to unsee that as well.  So Tom Papa is very good friends with Rob Zombie.  So we're like, we should get Tom in here to help us out a little bit.  Yeah, we're pals.  He could be a tough interview.  Rob?  Thank you for saying that.  Sometimes Rob gets quiet.  We've had quiet interviews with Rob Zombie over the years.  He doesn't suffer fools.  I had a lovely chat with him when we were at Comic-Con.  That's the last time.  Just flowed like two old friends.  Yeah.  Aw, that's adorable. 
[02:07:00]  But I think Tom's right.  It could be tough at times.  If he's not in the mood, Rob is one of those guys, which I totally don't have this gear,  where we just did a...  He directed my last comedy special, which we just did a couple months ago.  And people come in, like production people and stuff, and you're doing the day of the thing.  Like director, lighting people, whatever, comes into the green room.  And Rob's just there with his sunglasses on.  Oh, shit.  And they'll be like, so that light's not working, but maybe we can do without it. 
[02:07:30]  And Rob just goes, no, you've got to fix it now.  And they go, well, it's broken.  We can't.  And I get nervous, so I start going, ha, ha, ha.  And Rob just kind of stares at them and just will let the uncomfortable feeling wash over the room  until they're like, okay, we'll fix it right now.  You know what I mean?  I don't have that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He knows what he wants.  Yeah.  Good for him.  The word you're looking for is moral courage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  I think you're right.  I'm a total sap.  You were telling me you spent a whole summer riding with him at his house,  so I asked you what kind of house does he have,  and you said he has the Munsters house.  Yeah, it's exactly what you think Rob would live in.  It's got that giant polar bear thing from the beginning of the Addams Family in the lobby.  I mean, it's just that house.  It's got crazy, gory stuff from movies.  Does he have dead stuff in there?  Yeah, there were a couple things that looked dead.  That looked dead. 
[02:08:30]  I think I might have seen A Shrunken Head.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some wildness in there.  A lot of vintage movie posters and all the classic Dracula stuff.  Right.  I wonder if he's seen Kirk Hammett,  because Kirk Hammett from Metallica is a big fan of that shit.  Oh, yeah.  And he wrote a book with all this great photos of his stuff in there.  Yeah.  And it's amazing, all the shit he has.  Kirk Hammett has fucking 25 years of Metallica money,  and all of it is into fucking monster posters. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Obsessed.  It's really cool.  You start to see, oh, he has a real respect for this genre of scary movies  and all that kind of horror stuff.  And when you see it, you're like, oh, it's kind of cute.  It's like, he likes clowns and funny-looking monsters from the lagoon.  And then you watch his movies that he makes, and you're like, no,  he has a deal with the devil.  Right.  This isn't adorable.  He's evil.  He's evil. 
[02:09:30]  He's totally scary.  He has a deal with the devil.  But he's a fascinating combination because he has that,  he has all that crazy monster on stage, monster in movies,  just a complete beast.  But then he has this really love of comedy and a real cool sense of humor  and smart and, you know, so it's a real weird mix.  And I believe he's from Framingham.  Framingham?  Yeah.  Massachusetts.  Yes, he is.  I was from Ashland when I was up there.  Right next door.  Right next door. 
[02:10:00]  If you can't afford Framingham, you go to Ashland.  Yeah.  If you can't afford Natick, you go to Framingham.  All shit flows downhill.  Man, he's...  I knew he had a suit to armor somewhere.  Had to.  Yeah.  His house looks like Disney's Haunted Mansion.  Exactly.  There it is.  That's a rock star house.  Yeah, that is a rock star house.  Pretty cool.  This is the L.A. place.  Oh.  Now he's moved east.  He still has that place, I think.  Must be nice. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Well, you really know.  He's a rock star.  No, we hang all the time.  He's a...  There's the bear.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you just saw this video.  Yeah, and his wife is really super hot.  His wife is...  I would hope so, yeah.  She's a dancer, right?  Like, she danced with him on tour?  Yeah.  One of his dancers on stage?  Yeah, once in a while now.  But they're really cool people, and I don't know.  I just like being around a rock star.  Let's just be honest.  I can't believe a rock star likes me, so I just kind of hang out there.  We do the Rob Zombie interview through Tom Papa first, and then when Rob Zombie comes 
[02:11:00]  in, we ask him the same thing.  Yeah, and then he'll talk about something, like, you know, and we'll go, like, yeah, been  there, done that, Rob.  Yeah.  Tom told us everything.  Tom told us.  Let's be honest.  We're going to just watch two friends talk for a half hour, and then we're going to call  it a day.  We have a meeting today.  You do?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  It's a nonsense meeting.  It's not an important one?  No, it's for go-to meeting.  We love the concept, but I don't know why we have to meet with the go-to meeting people.  It's pretty obvious what it's all about. 
[02:11:30]  Because they want to sponsor the show.  They're making us go-to meeting to talk to go-to meeting.  It's ridiculous.  Wait a minute.  It doesn't make sense at all.  Can we, should we be able to do this from home?  Yes.  That's their whole concept.  That's the whole thing they're selling.  That you don't have to actually be in a conference room.  You could have a meeting anywhere.  So how about we do the meeting from my home, Dan's home, and they could be wherever the  fuck they are.  In any sense, that would show how great the product is.  If it's like a meeting, why do we have to have a meeting here at the studio?  Why are we going for a traditional meeting? 
[02:12:00]  Well, we're going to need you guys to come in.  No, the whole concept is you don't have to come in for meetings anymore.  Yeah, but we want you to come in.  It's like going to Burger King for a meeting with McDonald's.  Right.  And we're showing everyone how well we know this concept.  So thus, then, we don't need the meeting.  Yeah.  How funny.  You go to the meeting.  People just keep coming in with water and dropping stuff.  It's a tiny hot conference room and nothing's working.  And we're negotiating the meeting time, which is classic.  Yes. 
[02:12:30]  We gave them a half hour.  We said 10 to 10.30.  No problem.  But I have to pick up my kid today.  I really, my out is 10.30.  Yes.  I think we got it down to 10.10 at this point.  Are we down to 10.10?  10 minutes, I said.  It's down to 10 minutes.  It's at 10 minutes.  Are they coming to you or are you going to them?  We have to go to the conference room.  In the conference room.  Oh, boy.  And it's over the phone, though.  So they're going to be on that little triangle phone thing.  Oh, really?  Or the computer or something.  And we'll just be like, you will hear like,  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  Hi, how you doing? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, good meeting.  How are you guys doing?  I just want to tell you a little bit about the product.  And there's always someone in the background you can barely listen to.  Right.  Yeah.  Or hear whatever.  And we always have it on mute.  And then over the years, me and Ed, we'll take turns.  We'll pop the button.  Yeah, it sounds great.  Yeah.  Put it back on mute.  We don't even know what they're talking about.  We just know the right phrases to say.  As they're talking, me and Opie look at each other and do the universal sign of jerking off.  We're running video.  We're running video. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we look forward to it.  Boom, back on mute.  Sounds great.  Yeah.  Okay.  I always feel like when I'm on those calls, I say hello and then it's ten minutes of wrapping it up.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Oh, that sounds great.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Let me know.  Let me know.  Yeah.  Let me know means get off the fucking phone.  They don't get the hint that you're trying to wrap up.  All right.  Well, touch base with you then.  Cool.  Looking forward to it. 
[02:14:00]  Great.  Great.  All right.  Great.  Die.  We're very excited.  We're working with you people.  And the greatest silence you'll ever hear is right when everyone hangs up because no one  wants to say anything just in case they're still in line.  So you just sit in silence for like a few seconds and then go, are we done?  Can I get the fuck out of here?  But everyone pauses.  Yeah, you're right.  You look to make sure no lights are on on the phone you're using.  You don't want to say anything stupid.  And then the real fucking asshole.  Oh, shit.  I'm here.  You're on a fucking conference call. 
[02:14:30]  You're in different places and you want to talk about it after.  So I'll call you right back.  And then you make sure you hang up.  Everybody hangs up the fucking phone and gets a clean, open line.  Yes.  You never do that.  You just talk to.  Oh, yeah.  It's always like, oh, what a waste of fucking time that was, huh, guys?  But thanks for doing it.  We really appreciate it.  It goes a long way.  Yeah, whatever.  All those phrases.  It's so funny that those business people really use all those cliches.  It's just they live in that environment all the time.  Of course they do.  All right.  We're going to send it up to flag balls. 
[02:15:00]  They love it.  Yeah.  They get out of their cubicle.  They get to go into the room.  Well, we're going to let this bake for a while before we blue sky it.  Are you?  Really?  We've got two buckets.  Do you?  They love me.  You know what it is?  It's something that they can write down on their little sheet that they did today.  That's right.  It's like, well, I got a conference call.  I did it.  Got a conference call today.  Honey, I got to go in early.  Got a big call.  Yeah.  And it's a chance for them to talk out loud and other people have to listen to them.  Oh. 
[02:15:30]  I was thinking if we bring down the product from Maryland.  Oh.  Wow.  Never heard that before.  And we got a new kiosk.  But we're going to upgrade the displays.  Oh.  Oh.  That's a good idea.  Great idea.  Great idea.  And we want to increase production.  Oh.  Oh.  Increase.  Not decrease.  Oh.  Not decrease.  But then at the end, it's just nothing.  We decide we're just going to take all the products and shove them in our asshole. 
[02:16:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Asshole.  In the asshole.  That's nice.  We're just a bunch of dopes that don't want to work hard.  I know.  And we have to talk to people that are working hard and get nowhere.  Oh, my God.  It just doesn't make sense.  It really is.  We are terrible.  A bunch of people who've spent their whole lives avoiding any kind of professional interaction  with anybody.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's why we're here today.  Right.  It's the whole object of this.  Exactly.  Like, why are you forcing us into those situations that we're trying to avoid? 
[02:16:30]  We won.  We won the game.  It worked out well so far.  Leave it alone.  Sit down and be like us.  No.  That's what you have to do.  Right.  I can make fart sounds and not get fired.  Yeah.  You have to do it.  They came to us and asked us if we would be kind enough to do it.  Right.  Like, we could have just said no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And those corporate douches, man, when they see fucking meeting on their calendars, boy,  do they get excited.  They love it.  Woo-wee. 
[02:17:00]  Meeting day.  They love a good meeting.  Should we get some extra water?  Should we get a fruit platter?  Yeah.  Should we?  I think out of every meeting I've ever been to, maybe one or two have fleshed out something  useful.  Uh-huh.  I honestly...  Name one.  They're all just, you know, putting in FaceTime, as they call it.  We had a couple...  We had one meeting, one meeting with the entire staff once in the back that, like, something 
[02:17:30]  came up.  Like, an idea for something came up.  Right.  I fell asleep.  That's what I was about to say.  Yeah, you were...  I didn't...  I was out.  You having a recollection of this meeting.  I didn't say I contributed to the meeting.  I said the meeting that something actually came of it.  Well, Tom Popper...  I was asleep.  Tom Popper's a very creative guy, so let's run it by him.  These idiots, middle management, decided that we should start meeting again.  And we didn't necessarily disagree, by the way.  We're like, yeah, you know what?  Maybe get some fresh looks at some bits and stuff. 
[02:18:00]  So they set up a big, huge fucking room.  What was it?  Well, they actually...  Like, they rented out the performance space.  Uh-huh.  So they could put enough chairs around and make sure everybody was comfortable.  They have to rent out rooms around here.  Right next to the fishbowl.  Next to the fishbowl, yeah.  It was one big circle with them in the creative meeting.  They've never done anything creative in their lives, but they're going to now be part of  the creative meeting. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we're just sitting there, just staring at each other.  I was taking pictures of...  Whose boner was it?  Oh, someone had a boner.  I don't even remember.  It was a Roland.  Like, we go back to being like...  That's not mine.  We go back to being like nine or ten years old.  We're not even listening anymore.  I'm trying to sneak pictures of this guy's fucking boner that he had in his pants.  I sat in a comfy chair, which was mistake number one, because in any meeting, I will  fucking fall asleep.  I can't deal.  I instantly get that feeling like I've been up too long and...  Your brain's in retreat. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  So I decided I was going to pull the brim of my hat down to cover my eyes and just rest  my eyes.  Oh, no.  But you also left your big comfy jacket on that's like a blanket, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I pulled the jacket around me.  This is our creative meeting.  And I'm just sitting there.  This was done for us.  The next thing I know, like, everyone's up to leave, and I'm like, huh?  Did they know you were asleep?  Oh, of course.  Of course.  They were so bothered.  Because he's been in a lot of meetings, never the one that he really needs the most.  Oh! 
[02:19:30]  Whoa!  So we did it for like two weeks, maybe?  Two weeks.  And then they realized, okay, this is getting nowhere.  But it wasn't, don't say two weeks, it was two meetings.  It wasn't two consecutive weeks.  It was one meeting, and then like four weeks later another.  Oh, right.  I don't even remember that.  Yeah.  All right.  This is great.  This is really productive.  Let's implement this, and then we'll meet in another couple weeks.  They just knew.  And I think the most productive thing to come out of it, I think it was, yeah, we should  do cherry darts again. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, that was probably it.  It's not a new idea.  We should do that one more time.  Well, in all fairness, we got sick of doing these meetings, because we would bring some  pretty solid ideas to the table, and then everything, you know, fast forward, the meeting's  over, and then they get back to you like, ah, I can't do this because of this reason,  can't do this, lawyers have a problem with this, can't do this.  Can't afford it.  We could do this bit, but we have to do it in a corporate way, which obviously we wouldn't  want to do.  Right.  Then we're like, why are we wasting our time?  We gave you 10 ideas, and all 10 were shut down.  Bus trip anyone?  Thank you.  Let's go back to our tree house and be by ourselves. 
[02:20:30]  And be by ourselves.  Screw the parents.  That's what this is.  It's a little hideout in the woods.  Yeah.  Parents aren't allowed.  Yeah.  That's it.  No grown-ups.  Did they finally bail on the bus trip idea?  No, it's fall.  Officially?  Yeah, it's going to be in September.  Why haven't we heard anything since they put it off?  The one you were going to do in the spring?  That one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The one that was supposed to occur in like a week?  Are you supposed to be there right now?  Yes.  Exactly.  This would have been our bus trip time.  And we said it would never happen?  Right.  And we did say it would never happen months before it never happened. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, that's crazy.  But now it's not a never happened scenario.  Now it's been pushed off again.  So late September.  But they're already doing what I said would happen.  They're finding another event so then they could save face.  They came to me and said, why don't you guys go to Montreal for the comedy festival?  I said, that would be awesome.  I would love to do that.  So when they plan that trip and could maybe pull it off, which I doubt they can, then they'll  blow off the bus trip officially so they don't look like idiots.  This is why you don't go to meetings.  Of course. 
[02:21:30]  Because bus trip is definitely on the back burner now.  Yeah, that's on the way, way back burner.  Yeah, it's not until September.  So we'll deal with this stuff now.  Right.  It's bullshit.  Anyway.  I love the idea of just shutting my eyes.  Whenever you say, let me just rest my eyes.  Oh, that's so good.  Like driving a car.  Let me just blink a little longer.  One eye at a time.  I'll drive like this and like that.  But how scary is it when you are driving a car and you're in those situations?  You could talk yourself into thinking it's an okay idea.  Like it's okay if I do this right now. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Close my eyes.  I'm only going to close them for a second or two.  Right.  There's nothing that keeps you awake.  Like you'll just be there going like, oh my God, I almost crashed.  I got to stay awake.  God, holy shit, that was close.  I was weaving off the road.  All right, I'm good now.  I'm so good.  I am so good.  Oh my God, holy shit.  There's not a driver alive that has, you know, opened up their eyes and went, oh my God, how  long was I asleep?  You have no fucking, you have no fucking idea. 
[02:22:30]  You try to figure it out with the song that's on the radio.  Like, wait.  Just a hunk of metal hurtling down the highway with no one controlling it.  And you're inside it.  That's great.  That's the dingbat.  Yeah.  Because logically you thought it was okay to get a little, a quick rest.  Wow.  That is bad.  I can't drive as much now.  The older I'm, I used to like do gigs in like, I did a gig once in North Carolina.  And I was like, well, the gig's done.  I'm not going to stay here.  I got in the car 14 hours straight. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  It's hard to do that these days.  I can, now if I go to the stress factory, I'm like, I'm going to need a room.  Stress factory.  It's down the road.  For the people that don't know.  Yeah.  It's a half out for the city.  Right.  I'm really going to need to rest a little.  Tired driving was, for me, more dangerous than drunk driving.  Yeah.  Like I would never get drunk to the point of fucking like falling down and drive.  Right.  But I had some pretty good goddamn buzzes on when I'm driving. 
[02:23:30]  And, uh, and I would, I would just get into that.  I got to drive legally.  I got to drive, you know, fucking middle lane.  Not the right lane.  It looks like you're trying too hard.  Left lane's out of the question.  Middle lane, fucking 10 and two.  Put on the cruise control so your speed doesn't vary a lot.  And, uh, drive, drive home.  Yeah.  Uh, but tire driving, there's nothing you could do about it.  No.  There's no strategy for fucking being unconscious behind the wheel. 
[02:24:00]  I never stayed over.  I always drove home from Oneonta.  Upstate, like, you know, eight-hour rides, seven-hour rides, Buffalo.  Right.  When the gig was done, I was out the fucking door, man.  Right.  I never stayed over.  I don't know how you do that.  Now I don't drive anywhere.  D.C. is as far as I'll drive.  You will drive D.C.?  Yeah, five hours, because, again, with the airport, hour flight, hour and a half or two hours,  it's really not that much of a difference, and then one delay can just make you later. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And then you have to go from the airport.  It's really, it's only a little faster to fly, and a delay can wreck you.  You know what I like going to D.C.?  I like taking the train.  Oh, you know what, Tom?  It's a delight.  You know what, Tom?  Take the Acela.  It's a speed train.  You know what?  Get some Wi-Fi.  There's a snacky car.  Oh, you get that nice dinner they serve you with.  Oh, yum.  That's delicious.  I have the ground cartilage burger.  Hold on.  That's really good.  Not. 
[02:25:00]  So when's Rob coming in?  What the fuck happened?  Not.  What the fuck happened?  Said no one.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I said to myself, yourself.  I remember Mrs. Ross, my third grade math teacher, or a teacher, said that.  And I thought it was the fucking greatest thing.  I thought she was a genius.  Really?  She was funny. 
[02:25:30]  She was like a funny teacher.  But she's like, I said to myself, self.  And we all cracked up.  Wow.  That's fucking good.  That's good writing.  Yeah.  That was a young chip.  Is that your inspiration to get into comedy?  Yeah.  Like, I could do that.  But I kept fucking it up.  I said to herself, no.  Jimmy had a little Twitter battle yesterday.  What happened?  Well, Louis C.K.'s special was on HBO.  Right.  And I thought it was great.  Was it good?  There was another great special by Louis C.K. 
[02:26:00]  And he was basically, she says, this blogger for Mediate says that Louis was suggesting that  all pedophiles are gay.  Yeah.  One bit he was doing.  She was doing the thing where you take the joke and you make it that it was an actual,  literal, serious statement.  Uh-huh.  Um, and her, what her point seemed to be, I think, can we find her name, Sam?  I don't remember her name.  Was that, it was, uh, Miss something on, or something Delgado.  Delgado.  Yeah.  AJ. 
[02:26:30]  AJ Delgado.  And she said something like, her point was like, well, the left is hypocritical because  Louis has bashed Sarah Palin, blah, blah, blah.  And the left is hypocritical about who they go after, but it has nothing to do with Louis.  Right.  That's just Louis just doing his act.  Mm-hmm.  And I hate when I see a blogger or somebody else blog about being offended at comedy.  I just don't buy it.  Yeah.  It just annoys me.  Mm-hmm.  And so, uh, we talked about her.  Oh, one other point, because I think it's important.  Sure.  She does say in her blog that she is a fan of Louis, but it's one of those horse shit statements 
[02:27:00]  where you know she's not a fan of his, but it just helps her point if she says that.  There's no way you could be a fan of Louis C.K. if you're bothered by the all pedophiles  are gay, uh, suggestion.  Right.  If you listen to any of his other specials.  Or watch his show.  He goes after a lot of shit.  Yeah.  I mean, anybody, somebody blogs about this, it makes me angry.  Again, she has the right to do it.  Of course she has the right to do it.  But it makes me very angry because, hey, that's my job, too. 
[02:27:30]  And if, you know, someone's going to attack Louis, I'm up.  We're all up for it.  And the fact is we should all stick up for each other when it comes to this shit because  if no comics tolerated this shit, then no comics would really get in trouble.  If the other comics kind of stood up and said, fuck you, it's...  Comics are always so tight with each other and defending each other, aren't they?  In a lot of ways.  Not always, but a lot of times we do.  I mean...  Self-centered psychopaths.  Good.  He's going down.  Finally.  Finally. 
[02:28:00]  Someone's putting an end to the Louis train.  Guys are twisted.  No, but just this wormy way of phrasing it.  Did Louis C.K. imply pedophiles and gay men are in the latest HBO special?  Ah, did he?  Yeah, I'm just floating it out there.  I'm just saying.  Throw it at the wall.  See what sticks.  Oh, God.  So I bashed her on Twitter for her writing and for the article.  And, you know, I just didn't like it.  That's good.  And she didn't want to address me directly.  But, you know, she was feeding into it, of course. 
[02:28:30]  She was annoyed, I'm sure.  So we're going back and forth.  And then, you know, the fans tend to get involved.  Which is great.  It really opens up a lot of things for debate.  How big is her cunt?  Yeah, it really is ridiculous for me.  Oh, yeah.  I made fun of the way she looked.  But it's like, look, I don't tell people what to tweet or not because I don't care.  It's not my business.  But, you know, it's like some of them are saying, like, I hope you get raped.  And it's like, you know.  They really do go way too fucking far.  It's like you can be nasty or make fun of her. 
[02:29:00]  But, like, that's like.  Like your picture with the ostrich.  That's a little rough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you said that's a picture with her.  And it was the picture of you with the ostrich.  Yeah, I made fun of her.  That made me laugh.  I mocked her.  She might have a long fucking manly neck.  Making fun of somebody is like if you want to mock somebody.  And, again, I'm not telling you what to tweet.  Fucking do it.  But if you're tweeting at a woman, like a real person.  And you're telling her, like, you know, I hope you get raped.  It's like.  It's not.  She doesn't deserve that type of shit.  No. 
[02:29:30]  She's irritating.  Right.  She's an irritating blogger.  Yeah.  Right.  And you can mock her.  Yeah.  And be annoyed at her opinion.  And that could absolutely be twisted around as a threat or, you know.  It's just a violent.  It's very unsettling.  Yeah.  When it gets a threat-y.  Yeah.  I'm only saying this because it's like.  My interaction with her wasn't even nasty.  No.  But it was just like.  Don't.  What are you doing?  Don't say that shit.  I mean.  Again, if you want to, it's up to you.  I don't like to try to tell people what to say.  But.  That's just a little fucking rough.  Sometimes it's a little. 
[02:30:00]  I get put off a little bit when.  One of my tweets are retweeted.  And then someone writes something completely fucking horrid on it.  Right.  And I'm like.  You know.  Obviously I didn't tweet it.  It's a retweet.  Right.  But just have your name put with.  Because obviously I put a lot of.  I do a lot of racially based tweets.  It'll be like.  Hey.  There's a.  You know.  Why is there such a double standard.  With white on black crime.  As there is black on white crime. 
[02:30:30]  And I'll put that out there.  And then like.  Three tweets later.  It's like.  Because of niggas.  And I'm like.  You know.  No.  And they attach your name to it.  Yeah.  Right.  And now there's the name.  And it's that.  And I'm actually trying to open up a dialogue or something.  Yeah.  No.  I got an example of what you're trying to say here.  Lady Trucker.  What did you tweet the blogger?  Well.  She's from Cuba.  And so I called her a salty wetback.  Well.  Let me ask you.  Now.  I don't care if you said that.  But what.  Why can't you like. 
[02:31:00]  Have some intelligence.  Or at least be.  If you're defending the show.  Or Jim Norton in this case.  Why.  I love when the guy.  You know.  The people out there.  Actually have some intelligence.  That they hit her with.  Yeah.  But people that come down from Canada.  And people that come up from Mexico.  All the rest of American immigrants.  Are salty wetbacks.  And you're a fat slob.  What's.  So.  What's the point?  The point is.  The majority of Americans.  Are salty wetbacks.  Oh boy.  All right.  All right.  I don't care. 
[02:31:30]  You're asking too much.  I told you she tweeted that.  But then she retweeted that.  And put like.  Oh Jim.  How come you didn't go after her.  With that tweet.  Racist much.  Oh.  And I actually mocked her for writing that.  You're a Harvard graduate.  And you wrote racist.  No.  That doesn't affect me at all.  It's like.  No.  I take no responsibility for that.  And I don't care if they tweet that shit.  It's a little silly.  But I'm talking about violence.  It's like.  You can be as racist as you want.  But you know.  If you're going to be mentioning.  The only thing I agreed with.  Was when someone mentioned some. 
[02:32:00]  She was attacking people.  Who were like anonymously threatening to rape her.  She's like.  Use your real name.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And that I agree with.  It's like.  You can't write shit like that.  I mean.  You can.  If you want to.  But.  Only a gentleman.  Only a real gentleman.  Writes his real name.  When you threaten rape.  Right.  I think her.  I think her blog was shit.  And I think what she wrote was shit.  And it was wrong.  And I think that's up for attack.  I mean.  You know.  You bash what she wrote.  And if you want to make fun of her Twitter photo.  Yeah.  Her.  Her.  Her.  Her.  Sig pic.  Which you bet I did.  Because she has a long neck. 
[02:32:30]  And I mocked it.  And.  You know.  To be fair.  Putting Louie's name.  With pedophile.  In a headline.  Ah.  You know.  That's.  I mean.  That's his livelihood.  You're right.  He's.  You know.  I mean.  That's.  That's a pretty offensive act.  And what.  You're absolutely right.  What I didn't like about her.  Was this.  This is what I did not like about her.  Is that.  Then she plays the victim.  And it's like.  Oh.  They're all threatening.  It's like.  Don't put that on me.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Because you know.  What I've tweeted at you.  None of it had a threatening tone.  Right.  None of it had a. 
[02:33:00]  You should die tone.  And you know that.  She has the ability to read.  Like everyone.  So that.  That type of shit.  Like.  You want to write something.  About a comic.  And then a comic comes after you for it.  Uh huh.  Don't all of a sudden curl up in a ball.  And play a victim.  Because a bunch of the fans are being dicks.  You know I didn't.  And then she's like.  Well.  And this is what I love too.  This fucking.  She's like.  Well you're encouraging the frenzy.  I didn't tell anybody to do anything.  Don't be mad at me.  Because I have more Twitter followers than you.  Right.  Like you don't care.  What frenzy you cause. 
[02:33:30]  When you write something like this.  Right.  She's trying to get a frenzy going.  An anti-Louis thing going.  Right.  Right.  So if I bash what you wrote.  And I make fun of you.  All of a sudden.  I've started this frenzy.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  But anyway.  We invited her on the show.  Travis has emailed her two days in a row.  Not even to you.  I really wouldn't scream and yell at her.  But I really want to know.  Like what are you.  That drove me nuts.  Like to play that victim.  Like all of a sudden.  Yeah.  I'm keeping the frenzy going.  I'm not going to stop tweeting.  Because people choose to tweet dumb shit.  Right.  What do you want me to do? 
[02:34:00]  Not tweet because there's crazy people out there?  Yes.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Is this in a real spot?  Wow.  Is that true?  Is it her own thing?  Or is it.  I guess she works for Media Lab.  Okay.  Which has some heat.  Media Lab has some heat as a website.  We invited her on the show.  So we'll see if she wants to come on.  And again.  Not to scream.  I just had to talk to her.  Right.  Let me say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Yeah.  Hey boys.  Hey.  Fez was pissed at Louie yesterday also.  Oh God.  Who was Fez?  Ronnie said him straight. 
[02:34:30]  But yeah.  Fez was all pissy too.  About the same bit?  Yeah.  Well he probably just read that and didn't like see the better.  How does Fez not understand comedy at this point?  He works every day with a comedic genius and he doesn't understand how comedy works yet?  What the fuck's wrong with him?  One of the listeners kind of also brought up that Fez used to do a bit about Mr. Pants Puppet which was basically a gay pedophile.  And you know that kind of shut Fez up but at the same time you could tell Fez you know wasn't done but he shut up. 
[02:35:00]  Well I'm glad Ronnie said him straight.  You got to defend stand ups every single time.  Exactly.  Hey we got to take a break because Rob Zombie is going to start walking down the hall.  Tom Papa.  You got anything you're promoting Tom?  I'm at Bananas this weekend.  Bananas.  In Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey right?  Yeah and I have a big show coming up in Philadelphia at the Kimmel Center.  And it's going to be a nice theater which is going to be great in Philadelphia which I'm pushing and it's going to go to TomPapa.com for tickets. 
[02:35:30]  Alright and Jimmy's going to be in Baltimore.  Friday, Saturday only.  I thought it was Thursday but I'm dumb at McGooby's Joke House.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Come on, get down with the sickness.  Open up your hate and the death of what I make.  Come on, get down with the sickness. 
[02:36:00]  Disturb, right?  Why are you not playing Rob Zombie, Art?  Down with the sickness?  Because I played Rob Zombie last break and if I would have played it you would have said,  well you're playing his fucking music when he comes in so I went with something else.  No, I wouldn't have.  That doesn't make any sense though.  Why the anger?  So I play something almost similar-ish.  Yeah, you're playing his competition.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's doing that?  They're probably fighting for the same audience.  Hiroh Comet.  Wow, people are calling you a dummy.  He's not around anymore.  What?  Disturb's not around anymore.  It's not competition. 
[02:36:30]  They are around.  I bet you they're around somewhere.  They're probably like really big in, I don't know, Asia or something.  Yeah, why would you play someone else's music when you have a rock star coming in?  They're huge in Taipei.  Wow.  So is this show.  I think we are.  Well, Tom Papa, it's a pleasure seeing you again.  It's always good to see you fellas.  People are compelled to jerk off on video.  This fucking asshole.  Can't even get a heart on either.  Oh, gross. 
[02:37:00]  I've got footage from my house.  How do you do that for the whole world to see?  I don't know.  Is this what we're going to see in the go-to-meeting meeting today?  Yeah, right?  And you're trying to get intelligent tweets in the comic debate.  I know, I know, I know.  Oh, you're saying I should put my penis down and then tweet?  Yeah.  My expectations are a little too high.  Yeah.  A little high.  My mother would say they were pecker-tuggers.  Chip, don't go into that chat room.  There's a bunch of pecker-tuggers in there.  Pecker-tuggers? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, tugging their peckers.  Oh, I forget.  I noticed they pushed CNN to a side street.  Oh.  They didn't let them on Boylston for whatever reason.  I don't think they were letting anybody on Boylston.  Some of the other news networks looked like they were on Boylston.  Really?  Yes, they did.  Oh, CNN.  CNN is on one of those side streets where all the brownstones are.  Sam, are you happy that Rob's coming in today?  Yes.  Nothing new, huh?  I was about to ask that.  They haven't...  Oh, they know.  That means they know.  It's like breaking news. 
[02:38:00]  FBI takes charge of Marathon Probe.  They've been...  That's taken charge the second it happened.  And that's been the breaking news all morning.  Yeah.  They pulled something out of that apartment, it looked like.  They were wheeling something out.  Yeah.  Some kind of...  Device.  Snack box or something.  Oh.  I wonder at what point that conversation took place where the guy goes,  Who's in charge here?  And the Boston cop goes, I am.  And the FBI goes, not anymore.  I love that scene.  Like it happened. 
[02:38:30]  It had to happen yesterday.  Yep.  What movie is that?  Not anymore.  Every movie that's ever been...  Every movie where the feds take over.  Yep.  This is my jurisdiction for it.  It was your jurisdiction.  That's a big one.  The Die Hard is a good one with that.  Where it's that fucking guy from the Breakfast Club, I think.  That's who the cop is.  Yeah.  I'm in charge here.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Meanwhile, they would already know that.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, the FBI is kind of taking over here.  Yeah, of course.  And relieved.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  No one ever brings that up.  Texting is, honey, I'm on my way.  Yeah.  Thank God the FBI is here.  I'm getting out of this.  No cop cares that his fucking, the investigation is being taken over by somebody else.  Oh, I wanted to write the report.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Someone sent me a link to a Family Guy scene.  Huh?  Where Peter Griffin wins the Boston Marathon.  Oh, yeah?  And it's really quick.  I'll just play it through my phone.  I'm Bob Costas here with Boston Marathon winner Peter Griffin.  Peter, how did you do it? 
[02:39:30]  Damn phone's busted.  Maybe I dialed wrong.  That wasn't on an episode.  Somebody put that together recently.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Wait, is that from, when is that from?  It's, someone put it up online yesterday.  Someone cobbled that together.  You think they cobbled?  That's why I'm bringing it up.  You think?  Absolutely.  Oh, that's not from an episode?  I don't know.  Come on. 
[02:40:00]  Huh?  Rob Zombie's coming?  That's silliness.  Does anyone know if that was actually from an episode?  No way.  That'd be a little strange, don't you think?  Exactly.  It's either strange or in very poor taste.  That would have been like fucking premonition.  Right?  Is that the word I'm looking for?  Why didn't you pre-order his new album?  I just buy it when it comes out.  But real fans are like, yeah.  Yeah, they want it early.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll get it at the same time.  No, you won't.  No, you won't. 
[02:40:30]  Get on iTunes.  I don't like your high-pitched, exasperated answer voice.  It's like he's getting ready for the prom.  Yeah.  My voice is changing.  Oh, no.  We got a minute.  What's going on with the Osbournes?  Some are saying they are breaking up.  Jack is now saying they're not breaking up and it's all bullshit.  But they have video of Ozzy basically leaving his house with boxes and stuff.  I'm bummed to hear Ozzy relapsed.  He did.  He said he's got 44 days now or 45 days. 
[02:41:00]  But for the last year and a half, he's issued an apology on Facebook to the fans, his family.  He's like my bandmates.  He goes for crazy shit.  Oh, was he all fucked up?  I guess it was a crazy year, man.  I didn't know it.  I thought he was sober.  I'm bummed for him.  How long was he sober before this?  Don't know.  A while, though, right?  Yeah, I think so.  Seemed like it.  So, I hear they're not getting divorced.  Jack said it's bullshit.  They're not getting divorced.  Maybe they're separated.  I mean, maybe the drinking or whatever fucked him up.  Maybe that's why he's sobering up now.  I'm wondering if Sharon left because of that. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  There he is.  Hey, Rob.  What's up, Rob?  What's going on, bro?  Robby.  Take a seat.  What's up, baby?  Hello.  How are you?  How you doing, man?  Hey, how are you?  Good to see you.  I was doubting that Tom was a friend of yours, but apparently so.  Yeah, we saw the smile.  I was like, no, I didn't say that.  I'm friends with Don Zombie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  He just lives up.  Look, disappointment on his face when I walked in.  Oh, that guy. 
[02:42:00]  The only two people I play Words of Friends with are sitting in front of me right now.  It's little Jimmy and Rob.  Oh, really?  I haven't beaten either of you ever.  And you haven't.  Actually, mine actually says I'm supposed to remind you because you haven't played in  like 15 days or something.  I was slacking off there, Tom.  Hey, look at his phone.  I don't want to admit to 15 days, Tom.  Just spiky case.  We were just talking about you just have to play.  Just accept it.  Just accept I'm going to lose. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I always lock up when I'm down to one letter and I know I'm going to lose.  Yeah, I hate that codependent reminder thing.  Tap someone and remind them.  No, they should fucking know.  It's not count.  Just play the U and get it over with, Tom.  I might have the Q and you're going to have to deal with it.  That's the fucking worst.  I'm so terrible at spelling.  I can't like play that or Scrabble or anything.  I sit there going like, I'm the guy that just sits and goes, um, uh, and I'm looking  at the letters and they just, I have no clue what can be made with it. 
[02:43:00]  Well, the great thing is you just go, hmm, clonk.  Didn't know that was a word.  65 points.  Oh, you could, you could put shit down and then it'll tell you like, yeah, that's why  any of you can play.  That's the most frustrating part.  Jimmy had that recently where he had some 75 point word.  He does not know this is a word.  I lucked up on it.  And it used to be, well, you have to look at the Scrabble dictionary and then you get  one turn.  And if not, then you lost your turn.  Now you could just go 40 times in a row.  Whatever sticks.  It's like, Jimmy doesn't know that fish knocker is a word. 
[02:43:30]  How about something is a word?  You're like, zen.  Doesn't work.  Yeah.  There's some Z word like the zen that doesn't work.  Right, exactly.  Zod.  How many people from Superman 2 have tried Zod?  Zod.  No good.  But fucking Z-A is a word.  Q-I.  Z-A, yeah.  Quone.  What's that?  Quone.  Means to quone.  Yeah, Kramer tried that one.  It didn't work.  Right.  Thank God someone gets my Seinfeld reference.  Rob knows.  Means to quone. 
[02:44:00]  But it's funny when Alec Baldwin got in trouble on the plane and then they said he was being  difficult because he was playing words with friends.  I'm just thinking, well, he probably had a great word.  Like, I get why he didn't want to shut his fucking phone off.  I understand.  The fucking mania.  Losing an online game is humiliating.  It's funny when you're playing and you go back and forth.  Like, I hit a word.  You hit a word.  And you're like in real time doing it.  And all of a sudden they disappear for a day.  You're like, what is he doing?  What happened to Jimmy?  Do you play Scramble? 
[02:44:30]  Anybody play Scramble?  No.  It's like a word search, but you have to drag your finger over the window.  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  It's fucking nerve wracking.  You need at least two minutes.  That's a great game to play while you're shitting because you can't stop because it's a two-minute  clock.  So you just drop a juice and play Scramble.  Try to time it out.  Sounds great, Jimmy.  It's like words with friends.  It's the same.  It's words with Scramble.  I've noticed with the advent of the smartphone, a lot more time spent on the ball.  Unnecessarily.  I know.  Unnecessarily.  You can stand up off the ball. 
[02:45:00]  You look like that newborn fawn.  Your legs are just shaky and numb.  I don't know how filthy everyone's phones are.  I know.  Fecal matter over everyone's phones.  It's true.  It's got to be.  That is a terrible thing.  But nothing can be worse than the motel room remote anyway.  Right, exactly.  If your immune system can handle that.  You can handle anything.  And I'm not a germaphobe, so I really don't care.  But I've used the remote while I was eating in a hotel room. 
[02:45:30]  And you just think, like, ah, I've got my hands on it.  I've got my hands on the burger.  It's disgusting.  I figure it builds up some kind of fucking immunity to something.  It's good for you in the end.  Yeah, it's good for you.  I guess it makes you a little bit healthier or strengthens you, but who cares?  Good germs.  What are you doing, Robbie?  Why'd you come into town?  Why'd you come off the mountains?  I am pushing the movie, pushing the record, just pushing stuff all over people.  When's Lords of Salem open? 
[02:46:00]  Ah, Friday.  What is today?  Today is about Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Tuesday on the 19th.  Is it the 19th Friday?  Yes.  Oh, very cool.  Finally.  So and finally get it out of my life.  How far into a movie opening do you know, like, if it's going to be a great weekend?  Like, do you get, like, counts, like, the first couple of hours?  Are you obsessed about that or wait the next day?  They kind of do, but I don't really pay attention that much anymore because I was doing that  on Halloween when that came out, and I remember getting the counts.  They're like, well, the 11 a.m. screenings doesn't look good on Friday. 
[02:46:30]  Like, the movie had been out, like, 15 minutes.  Holy shit.  And then it was great.  And they're like, oh, my, we're adding extra screenings at midnight because they're selling  out.  But it was like, well, why do you start the day with, like, a 10 a.m. screening and  Boise didn't really do well?  You know, it's like, I don't even want to know.  Not a lot of people getting their coffee and going to Halloween.  No, you can't.  I just like, I don't, you don't have an early morning crap.  I'm done worrying about things I can't control.  Right.  It is what it is.  How much, you collect stuff. 
[02:47:00]  We had Kirk Hammond in, and he has a book out of, like, all this great, like, horror  film.  Yeah, he has a lot of stuff.  Do you have, do you have a lot of stuff like that, too?  Like, do you collect the originals, or you don't care?  I had a lot of stuff for a while, but then I stopped collecting it, and I just gave up.  Why?  Did it become too overwhelming?  It just gave up.  It just one day, I was just like, I just don't want all this crap.  Yeah.  And I get my, like, and I can, I can now look at someone else's stuff and go, oh, that's  cool, without feeling like, now I must own all that also.  Right.  Which is like how I used to feel, like, and now I must have it. 
[02:47:30]  You know, now I don't feel that way.  But you still have a bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  I still have the stuff that I had.  I've been trying to liquidate it, but.  You should, when your friends visit you, that you should send them out with something.  I was sort of doing that for a while, actually, because I had, like, Kirk collected so many  movie posters that I was giving them away at every, everything, and they were very, you  know.  Well, that's weird.  Expensive ones, but.  That's weird.  That you never got one.  You gave away a lot of stuff like that.  They probably knew you'd have nowhere to put it.  I mean, you're not going to hang a movie poster in your living room. 
[02:48:00]  Over my daughter's bed.  Yeah.  I knew the day I was, like, I would frame them, but then I had so many, they were just  on huge rolls.  Right.  And they were all, like, really expensive, and I'd be going through them, and I'd be  like, I don't remember buying this.  I don't remember buying this.  Oh, shit.  Where'd this come from?  I don't remember buying this twice.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  I was like, this is done.  Wow.  Done.  What's the one piece you can't let go of?  Is there any that you're like, I love this one too much to let it go?  No, I mean, I have some that, I mean, I have a bunch of Lon Chaney ones from, you know,  silent movie posters that some of them are the only existing copy, or maybe there's one 
[02:48:30]  other one that exists.  Like, really, stuff like that.  Those are pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  Do you display all your stuff?  I'm actually having shelves built, like, to put them up, because I have no place to  put all this stuff.  Right.  And I want to get it all displayed nicely.  There's no reason for it to just sit in the closet.  Well, that's the thing.  Yeah, it becomes like an endless, like, I'm going to move these boxes to this storage space  now.  And one day when I display it all, and that day never comes.  Yes.  You think you're going to open a museum? 
[02:49:00]  It goes to another basement that will eventually flood, and you go, I'm gone.  Garbage now.  Because that happened to me once I had, like, every vinyl and the poster, so much stuff  in the basement flooded, and it was almost kind of a good feeling.  Like a relief.  All that crap's gone.  I don't need that shit anymore.  Yeah, it feels irreplaceable, and some of it is, but it's like, what am I going to,  it's just the idea of possessing it is much more important than actually showing this  stuff off, and it becomes this creepy obsession that there's no endgame.  Yeah, once you lose the obsession, you're like, ugh.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  It almost gives me anxiety to think of having all that crap now.  Did you see that tweet the other day that someone said that I should go on tour with  you and come out on stage before you start?  That would be good.  Yeah, I saw that tweet.  Comedian, you mean.  What's that?  Comedian, stand-up at rock shows always goes over really well.  No, I was thinking maybe do something different.  Maybe, I don't know, leave it up to you.  Maybe dance.  Dance?  How about just walk slowly down some stairs while other girls dance around you?  That'd be nice.  I've seen you do that at work hall. 
[02:50:00]  For my new comedy special, Rob and I wanted to do like the, everybody's like anti-showbiz,  and they just show up like a t-shirt, and they don't really care.  Yeah.  And we're like, let's, we should celebrate that we're in show business.  Let's make this special at the beginning of it.  Let's make a show.  Really great.  Like a Busby Berkeley beginning, entrance.  Yeah, we have like, we actually have showgirls come out, and they're like dancing this really  cool song, and then this thing in the middle enters, and I come down, and all these beautiful  girls come down with me.  That's awesome.  It's awesome. 
[02:50:30]  It really came out great.  What a rule.  Yeah.  That hasn't been done in a while.  It's so funny because as a comedian, then you have like this huge opening, and then it's  like, hey, so, uh, my wife's crazy, right?  Hey, you guys, there's a new Pope.  I can't wait in line at the airport as much as I do.  Isn't that weird?  Rock is so much more built for a grand entrance.  Yeah.  Because with comedy, it's like the opening joke better fucking hit.  If it's a five, it's really humiliating.  Exactly.  Kind of a letdown.  Yeah.  Then you see people going like, oh. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It's not fun, is it?  They're all standing up, and you're like, fuck, the West Side Highway, huh?  Boom.  Gets a shit.  Maybe it's one of those nights where Chris Rock shows up and doesn't tell anybody  he's going to be here.  When are you airing?  You're airing in what, July?  Yeah, July.  I'm trying to find.  I have it on my phone somewhere.  Not that that works for radio, but.  Oh, we're going to see it.  We've got to see the entrance.  60% of the stuff we do is not radio friendly.  Right.  I do a lot of visual stuff here.  About 80% of the audio shit is not radio friendly. 
[02:51:30]  It's just garbage.  It's great because Rob has a...  That was just a rehearsal.  Rob will just be like, when we're doing it, Rob's like, so then we're going to have a...  It's going to look like the gong show in Sonny and Cher, and then we're going to have  showgirls come out, and then Tom's going to come flying out of the center.  But you hear that?  Oh, shit.  It's got that cool sound, like the old...  Yeah.  A projector.  Right.  And then all the production people are like, yeah, okay.  Rob's like, staring at me.  No, that's what we're doing.  And then first the giant silhouette appears of you.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  It's pretty big.  It's got...  Pretty full of yourself there, Tom.  Yeah.  It's a real showgirl set.  It looks like a Vegas set.  Yeah, no, it's huge.  Yeah.  And it's really, really well lit.  It looks like a Vegas set.  Yeah.  It's pretty crazy.  It's funny.  You know, like we were just saying off air, you know, doing the special was a little taste  of, no, let's be like a star.  Let's make this thing badass and big, and which comes naturally to Rob.  Because, you know, we were saying how rock stars, like a rock star, well, you don't have 
[02:52:30]  like an option in your closet of like a polo shirt when you walk out.  You have all badass rock star clothes, even when you're in your most casual.  But for a comedian to like go that full bore, it was like, is this okay?  Am I allowed to walk down?  Purple velvet too much?  Yeah, yeah.  It's very out of context.  I love the sound of that fucking old time.  It's a great sound.  It looks like an old time camera.  Like, I don't know how you get those little, that jump.  This is why Rob is great to work with. 
[02:53:00]  I'm like, let's do an opening of getting to the special where we're walking through  the city streets, and it looks kind of 70s retro, you know, we'll dress like that.  It's like the French Connection or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Popeye Doyle going to it.  It's so dirty, right?  We show up to do it, and Rob's like, takes out this phone.  He's like, all right, let's go.  I'm like, what do you mean, let's go?  Where's the crew?  Where's the makeup?  That's not the part where he was thinking, oh, it's great.  That's where he's going, like, Cynthia was right.  He filmed it all off an app on the iPhone.  Holy shit.  He's walking through the city, and he's like, okay, now come this way.  And that whole thing you just saw was all done from the iPhone. 
[02:53:30]  No kidding.  That looks fucking, who said, who said it?  What happened?  It looks like Mean Streets.  This is the intro.  It's like 16 millimeter, 8 millimeter.  Oh, William Stevenson.  Okay, that's how I knew.  Those effects.  Wow.  And we had no permits.  We were filming walking around.  We were in the elevator.  The guy got in the elevator.  You're like, I told him to move.  Buddy, could you move?  You could get out of the way.  Get out of the shot.  You're in the shot.  What do you do for audio, though?  Like, that's my problem with those.  Is the audio, or are you mic'd, or is it silent?  It was silent.  Oh, okay.  It was all the music. 
[02:54:00]  Well, you know, we didn't use it to shoot the actual special.  Right, right.  I mean, that's...  Right.  Now, that would be silly.  And then Rob was standing up in the middle of the auditorium.  Just keep going.  No crowd.  That was pretty funny, Tom.  Take it again.  How many cameras?  You're right.  Your parents are stupid.  They don't understand Facebook.  Did you use smoke?  I shot in Boston, and we couldn't use smoke, and I was panicked about it.  Until Louie told me, like, I never use smoke, but I was convinced you had to use it before 
[02:54:30]  the show.  Or did you use it, or no?  Smoke?  We did on the first one.  Like, for the light?  Oh, you don't have to.  We didn't on this one, because we wanted to make it look like a TV show, but we did  on the first one, not so for the lights, but more so that it would look like the audience  was smoking.  Oh, really?  Like, we had the smoke in the crowd, so that...  Because Tom wanted to look like, you know, like Richard Pryor, Sunset Strip concert or  something.  Okay.  So we tried to make it look like everybody was smoking.  Yeah.  Oh, but you didn't use it for this, so that's encouraging to hear that it's not as...  No, yours looks critical.  Without the smoke.  I love how it looks, but I was panicky about it, because Boston has all these weird fire 
[02:55:00]  code regulations now.  Right.  Yeah, New York does, too.  Using foggers in New York is tough.  Yeah.  They won't let you shut the...  Because you've got to shut the smoke alarms off, and I guess after that great white fire, everybody  fucking panics.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When are you going on tour again?  June.  June?  June.  Is it a big outdoor show?  Yeah, it's a Mayhem Festival.  Headlining that.  Oh, cool.  June 29th is the first show.  Is it going to be a...  So it'll be a big...  The big show?  The big shoe.  Nice.  Yes, the really big shoe.  Did you...  I saw Rob at, what was it, Roseland when you were here, or Bowery? 
[02:55:30]  No, Hammerstein.  Oh, Hammerstein.  Yeah, that was the little shoe.  And it was a little show, and he was backstage, it was kind of a smaller set.  That was a nightmare.  And he's like, we can't...  I have this new thing that we drive around on stage.  It won't fit through the door.  Drive around.  Half the show was in the truck.  That was a drag.  He was always...  His show was so huge, like with monsters and this giant thing.  He's like, we've got this great thing that we drive around.  What is it?  Like a...  It looks like a giant tank.  He drives around on stage. 
[02:56:00]  The funny thing was, they're like, well, I'm like, how come we can't get on stage?  They're like, we have to load it through the front.  So once the crowd's in, there's no way to access the stage.  I'm like, oh, wow.  He was so pissed up.  Jim Florentine was backstage.  I want to see it.  Come on, man.  Just do it.  What's the problem?  Who cares?  Yeah.  There's no pyro in New York.  But that's going to be good.  I can't wait to see the big show.  That's the part about being a rock star that's hard.  There's so much to this.  Being a comic, you just fucking walk out and all you need is the mic working. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  But these guys have so many.  It's great to be able to come up with ideas and make them reality, you know?  It's like, yeah, I want a big tank.  I want to drive it around.  Fuck it.  Right.  It's also great to just walk on stage with a microphone and pick up a check.  Yeah.  That's pretty great for that.  Where's the crew?  Oh, it's just me and my suitcase.  See you later.  Although a Jim Norton check and a Rob Zombie check are not the same check.  But it is easier.  You don't have to worry about anything.  You don't have to worry about, like, necessarily your voice. 
[02:57:00]  There's a lot of shit that you have to put up with, this kind of...  Yeah.  New York's a rough place to work, too, because the fucking unions and the stages, it's much  harder to get stuff done here.  New York?  Oh, yeah.  New York is the toughest, actually.  It's really difficult.  Yeah.  You know what's difficult?  Having your family come see you perform at a place called Bananas.  Yeah.  Bananas.  Bananas.  Bananas.  Bananas.  It's always got to be some cute, funny name.  Yeah.  That's like comedy.  Every comedian on a talk show, they always seem like they're embarrassed to say,  I'll be at the Chuckle Hut. 
[02:57:30]  I didn't want to say the name.  It's never a great name, either.  No.  I'm performing at Laugh Until You Jizz at a brand new club.  I hear they treat you real good.  They let you eat off the whole menu.  Are you done with...  You and Manchin are not touring anymore, right?  No, that tour ended, yeah.  Okay.  Was it really bad, or was that all blown out by the websites?  It was fine.  It was like one weird moment.  It was fine.  Okay.  It's like people grab that, and they make it look like that's the way the entire tour 
[02:58:00]  or the entire situation is.  They like a story.  Yeah.  They like a drama.  So who else is on Mayhem?  Are you headlining the whole thing?  Is this one of those all-day long things?  Yeah, one of those all-day things.  So, I don't know.  Five Finger Death Punch is on.  I like those guys a lot, man.  I didn't know their first two records, but this third album, American Capitalist, is fucking  fantastic.  Oh, yeah?  They're really heavy, yeah.  It's like a thousand bands.  Nice.  Literally.  A thousand bands.  A thousand bands.  Do you care who you're on after ever? 
[02:58:30]  Are you ever concerned about following somebody?  No.  Can't worry about it.  Do you worry about what they do, or do you have what you'll allow them to do stage-wise  before?  Like, you don't want pyrotechnics or anything that kind of resembles your show?  Um, that really hasn't been a problem, I mean, for the most part.  We don't...  Nobody does that.  Yeah, true.  No, we don't try to limit what anyone else can do.  That'd be pretty lame.  Because I've seen...  I've seen...  I remember I went to...  It was years ago, 20 years ago.  Woodstock 94, they had comedy on the side.  It was fucking horrendous. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, we just bombed in front of people in the mud.  I was like, you probably can't hear you.  They did, unfortunately.  It was so...  Believe me, they heard it.  That wasn't the situation.  They heard every word.  They heard it, and they rejected it.  Trying to help you out there, Jimmy.  There was on these side stages, but on the main stage, the headliner was Aerosmith, and  before it was Metallica in 94, and I'm like, why the fuck would you want to go on after  Metallica?  Like, what is Aerosmith doing?  And I guess they were the bigger name.  Right.  But it just...  It seemed like a rough go.  They want to be big. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, something like...  They would not have to kiss.  I saw them in 2002, and I was like, why would you follow kiss?  It's just ego shit.  You think so?  Maybe.  I was at the Woodstock 99, and I was on the stage, like on the side.  Of the main stage, you know, bringing up bands and doing stuff like that, and everyone  was like, and here's James Brown, and everyone would kind of hang out and high-five him on  his way, and then when Metallica came in, it was like, everybody off the stage!  And it was just like an army.  They just kicked everybody out.  I don't care.  No one has a credential to stay out here.  Oh, shit.  And it just blew everybody out, and it was just like nothing but business. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the way it goes.  Yeah.  That's the way it goes.  I got booted to it, and it was at fucking...  Was it Bonnaroo?  When they had a headline, Bonnaroo a few years ago, we were all on the stage, and they're  like, nope, Metallica has everybody cleared off.  Yeah.  And then you harumph, harumph on the way out.  Yeah.  Well, sometimes you've got to do that, though, because you get people standing around, and  you go, please move, and they're like, please move, because that thing you're standing in  front of him is about to explode.  You know?  That's his cock. 
[03:00:30]  Fire shoots out of that thing that you're sitting on.  Jesus.  So you might want to back up.  Have you ever almost been burned?  I mean, you know, fucking Gene Simmons obviously has been.  Hetfield got hurt.  Yeah.  I mean, it's happened.  It sucks.  Wrong place.  But, you know, it gets better as the year's gone.  Was it your fault, or was it a technical glitch on their part?  It was their fault.  Okay.  The thing I'm more worried about is sometimes you have the fire that's shooting up, but  I thought we were going to light our drummer on fire many times, because especially outdoors,  it's going up, and then the wind suddenly hits, and we don't worry, and suddenly it's 
[03:01:00]  going this way, and he's like, you know, ducking, trying not to be on fire.  We'll still play him, though.  Isn't it ever nice just to do a small show where you don't have to worry about the stage  show, like where you just do a fucking playing gig, and you don't have to worry, there's  no setup, or do you don't like to do that anymore?  I hate doing that.  Oh, you do?  I'm not trying to get more intimate, as some people say.  Right.  I want to be less intimate.  You do?  Yeah.  Less connected to them.  Yeah.  I love the last show I saw, when you yelled at everybody about their phones, because 
[03:01:30]  you know, he comes out, and everybody has their phones out, and he just rips into them, really  like, just no, like, hey, you're my fans, but it's just like, you fucking morons, put  your phones down and enjoy the concert.  Well, it's funny for a long time, because everyone's like, eh, he's not talking to me.  He doesn't need me.  It's getting embarrassing.  But it was great, because then it worked, and all of a sudden the phones were gone.  And nobody was really holding up phones, and it was like, and then it became like a party.  Yeah, it's really funny how you can feel it, because nobody will jump around, and no one 
[03:02:00]  will have fun, because they're so busy filming this horrible video that they're never going  to want to watch, that they can put on YouTube and get six views of.  But when they stop, and they go, oh, fuck, this is actually happening live, I can have  fun.  Right.  It is weird.  It's so much better.  So you find that they experience the live show less, and your audience reaction is deadened  by them all holding up phones.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  For sure.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, totally, because they're not paying attention.  I mean, they're staring at this.  Right.  And so you're looking down, and no one's actually looking at you. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, they're making a video.  They're not enjoying the show they're at.  Yeah, and they're texting their friend.  Yeah, it's really weird.  Five years from now, it'll be Google Glasses, though.  Like, this is just a temporary thing, while people get used to capturing everything.  Right.  We'll be used to it sooner or later, and then you look out, and everybody will have  these fucking 3D glasses, you know, typing it, you know, streaming, like, where you bought  your shoes across the glasses.  Those are from Zappos.  Hey, when is your CD coming out?  I'm ordering those shoes.  When is your CD out? 
[03:03:00]  23rd.  So that's, like, next Tuesday or something?  What's it called?  Yeah, next Tuesday.  Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor.  Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor.  You know, I came up with that title, didn't realize, I think that was a Neil Young record.  His acoustic.  His acoustic.  One of the slower, slower albums.  He was rockabilly.  And all the real fans have probably pre-ordered it.  I hope so.  Yeah, for sure.  Push those three copies out the door.  The guy that has the zombie tattoo.  He has a Rob Zombie tattoo, and he won't pre-order. 
[03:03:30]  I want to buy it when it comes out.  I know, but the pre-order makes the artist see how many people are buying his stuff.  Yeah.  Then I'll pre-order it.  I wouldn't have checked, so it doesn't matter.  You could have bought it.  All right, yeah.  I know, but Sam, I thought it was one less than it should have been.  I know.  Sam, you got a question?  Yeah, sure.  Why don't you go to a microphone?  Do you know Sam's big fan?  Yes, from last time.  I'm glad that you really made no impact on Rob and his name was tattooed on you.  He's a massive fan.  I remember.  I thought it was interesting.  A minute ago, you said you were kind of... 
[03:04:00]  Why wouldn't you stand here, Sam?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Mike over there by his camera.  Making your idol turn around.  What's the matter with you?  You were done with the Lords of Salem.  You wanted it out of your life.  Yeah.  How long do you...  I'm just joking, but...  I don't answer the question.  Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, boo, Sam.  But you move on from project to project.  Like, do you really get sick of things?  No, I don't get sick of it.  Dumb questions.  It's just like...  It's like anything else. 
[03:04:30]  You know, I mean, the movie has been done for a while.  It's coming out.  So I've seen it a million times.  I've worked on it thousands of hours.  But you forget no one else has seen it.  So it's like...  It's just kind of weird.  You want it off your plate.  You're now worrying about stuff for the tour.  You know, you're on to the next thing that's happening that you really...  Yeah, that's on your plate that you have to deal with.  So do you have to worry about marketing it and all that, or do you leave that to other  people?  Well, you know, that's kind of why I'm here, I guess.  Exactly, Sam. 
[03:05:00]  0 for 2.  Say, Rob, why do you refuse to do promotion while you're here?  Those were bad questions.  They're terrible questions.  Rob is uncomfortable.  No, no.  Yeah, I don't know.  What was the question?  Exactly.  Hey, do you...  I want to know, do you ever, like, want to...  Because, you know, you're a zombie.  Do you ever, like, want to write, like, a ballad or is there anything you ever wrote?  Like, fuck, I would love to do that, but it just doesn't fit any album I put out.  I mean, I like all kinds of music, but I...  No, it doesn't fit, and it's not that... 
[03:05:30]  I hate when...  I don't hate when it...  But it always seems a little embarrassing sometimes when someone wants to, like, oh,  this is the other side of me.  Yeah.  Check this out.  And you're like, really?  Not many bands have avoided that.  Suggs.  Suggs.  He's a douche.  It's like that Garth Brooks, Chris Gaines thing.  All right.  You were sort of like a Prince guy on the inside.  Yeah, what the fuck was that?  That was the weirdest one ever.  Didn't like shoes and whatever he was doing.  What was he doing? 
[03:06:00]  That was bizarre.  That was really bizarre.  What the hell was that?  I don't know.  No one knows.  Metallica got a lot of slack when they did a couple of...  You know, it's amazing how many, like, real Metallica fans hate the Black Album.  I love the Black Album.  I do, too.  I think it's fucking great.  I remember when that came out, I was down by CBGB's.  I don't remember who was playing.  And people...  There was somebody who had the record.  It just came out there, and he was, like, smashing it in the street.  And I was like, what the hell?  Yeah.  That's a little extreme.  What got you, Sandman, or nothing else matters?  Like, what the fuck did people get that reaction out of something?  Well, they got upset when they cut their hair. 
[03:06:30]  The fans lost their minds at first.  Yeah.  Right.  Just over them cutting their hair.  Well, I guess it just goes to show how fanatical their fans are.  Yeah.  That's fair enough.  No, people don't like when a band changes because it makes us feel older.  That's all it is.  It's like if the band somehow matures, it's like, oh, fuck.  I'm not 22 anymore.  Well, yeah, you're stuck in that weird thing where they want you to stay the same.  Like, that would be great, but, you know, you just don't have that ability to stay the same.  It just doesn't work that way.  You know, you get older, things change.  And also, everybody remembers things differently. 
[03:07:00]  Like, you can't come to a show and experience it like you're 15, and you just snuck out of the house again.  It's not my fault.  It's a product of your life, too.  Yeah, I'm sorry that you're 45 and have five kids, you know, and you're not a 15-year-old anymore.  Yeah, he sucks now.  No, you suck now.  Your life sucks now.  You know, you try, but, you know, it's all perspective.  Do you change as an artist?  Like, I mean, I know you do as an artist, but do you find that, like, I don't really want to do that song anymore because, like, you know, I'm not... 
[03:07:30]  It doesn't mean the same.  No, no.  I never really...  As long as a crowd's into it, I'm into it because I never really felt like, you know,  oh, man, I was in this...  Yeah, I always think it's a little like, oh, man, I was in this mind space in a row.  I'm just not that...  Bro, I'm not in that mind space.  Can't go there.  It seems like core shit.  Right.  I think it is, and it's bad for the fans.  It's like, yeah, I want to hear that.  Right.  Are you never going to play that again?  Oh, wow.  It's not about you, fucko. 
[03:08:00]  I think, you know, like Tom was saying at the beginning, I mean, there's a big element that it is show business, and I've always had the attitude that if you're going to play shows for free in your basement, then great.  You don't have to play your hits.  You don't have to do this.  You can do whatever the fuck you want.  But as soon as someone buys a ticket, you can't please everybody.  You can't tailor-make exactly what they want, but you have to make an effort to try to figure out what they do want.  Perish the thought you play Karma Police or Creep, you motherfuckers. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I get it.  Radiohead refuses to play Creep.  Really?  They haven't played Creep in who knows how long.  I know.  Yes.  The Steve Miller band came to my school during his jazz phase.  Oh, no.  Wow, what a great time to see him.  So disappointed.  Oh, my God.  It was a big effort.  Did he at least rework the hits?  Nothing.  Into a jazz fucking number?  No, it was all this jazzy, feel-good stuff.  I was like, what?  Hey.  No Jungle Love, huh? 
[03:09:00]  I don't get it.  I mean, I can get maybe that you thought that that would be a good idea, but once it's not.  Yeah.  Right.  Like, there's songs that we never play, and some of you are going to be like, oh, we've got to play this.  Let's play it.  We'll play it one night.  And halfway through the song, I'll just lean over and go, we're never fucking playing this.  This is why we never played it in the first place.  Done.  Because as soon as the crowds don't react, I mean, it's exactly like being a comedian.  Yeah.  If the joke's not working, you're going to keep doing it in your set forever because you like that joke.  Right.  And if every night the crowd is just looking at you like you're an idiot.  No, you go, done. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes you're like, I'm going to be stubborn and keep it until it works.  And then other times, halfway out of your mouth, you're like, this will never be fun.  What was I thinking?  You want to perform to a sea of disappointment?  Yeah.  But that's the same thing I'm jealous with singers about is the same thing that seems like it was hard.  Like the fact that a musician can do a song for a long time and people still love it.  And it's like, fuck, man, that must be great.  But it also seems hard because then they want you to do that.  So Kiss has to do rock and roll all night, which not that that's a terrible thing. 
[03:10:00]  But what if they don't want to do it one night?  They still got to do it.  Right.  And they got to make believe they're still way into it.  They have to feel as fresh doing it as they did.  I could never do that with a joke.  That's pretty brilliant.  Then again, if I had fucking chicks showing their tits, maybe I could do it.  It's really all about the crowd.  I mean, I think that's why, like, going back to the cell phone thing, why when the crowd starts doing that, that really, like, as soon as the crowd's weird, I kind of don't feel like playing any of the songs.  Wow.  Yeah.  It feels like a weird thing.  It feels like a chore. 
[03:10:30]  But if they're into it, you can play a song for the 10,000th time and be like, this is awesome.  Do you ever break out a joke that it's like if you're in a special show or something and you break out a joke that you've,  done, you know, years ago and it just slaughters?  Rob?  Why don't I do this?  Yeah, occasionally I'll do that.  But it's like, usually it's one that once I tape it, I'm done with it.  Like, you don't ever want to do it again because then the crowd knows the fucking punchline.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, but I usually don't retire jokes until I tape them.  Right.  I milk them. 
[03:11:00]  Until it's on tape somewhere.  Then I'm fucking finished with it.  What if the crowd minds, though?  I know comedians always say that, but does the crowd actually care?  You know, I did a show in San Jose recently and then San Francisco shortly after that.  And this one guy was like, I saw you in San Jose like a month ago and now I'm here.  And I was like, oh, did I show you some new stuff?  And he was like, what do you mean?  It's all funny.  He didn't even have the concept of new stuff, old stuff. 
[03:11:30]  He was like, I had a great time at both.  Yeah, but those are the people that will sit there and go like, oh, and they won't laugh a lot because they've seen it.  Because a joke catches you off guard.  That's what a joke kind of does.  That's why you laugh at it.  Catching you off guard is a big part of it.  I think certain comics can do it and certain ones can't based on their act, the material, how they...  Because Brian Regan, for some reason...  We all know the punchlines.  I've seen Brian Regan.  I know some of the punchlines to some of his old stuff.  And I still laugh my fucking ass off.  Yeah.  He's the only comic that people request fucking bits. 
[03:12:00]  They'll screw him out the entire show and he doesn't mind.  No, but there's stuff that Jimmy does that I would want to see again for sure.  Occasionally, but if it was a whole hour of it.  You know what I mean?  Like the occasional joke you could throw in or I'll...  Yeah, sure.  I think you could do it.  I think that the crowd doesn't pay attention like you think they do.  Yeah.  Because the amount of times people go like, hey, man, why didn't you fucking play such and such?  They go, we just did.  That was the song that we're just playing.  Oh, shit. 
[03:12:30]  That's when you realize, don't pay attention to it.  It's a much bigger deal to us, I guess.  Well, that's what I used to care.  I used to freak out and someone would go, how was the show?  I was like, well, there was no guitar for the last four songs.  I didn't even notice.  Yeah.  What?  Right.  Bass and drums, the only thing happening for the last 20 minutes of the show.  I had no idea.  John Fye was picking his nose.  Cat joke.  No one's going to go.  Hey, that's a thing from the other specials.  Right.  No one's going to know.  I know.  And the other thing is, we think everybody knows our stuff.  Yeah.  It's pretty arrogant to think everyone in this crowd knows you so intimately and has seen 
[03:13:00]  you over and over.  Oh, they know I've done this before.  Right.  Yeah, they're going to recognize a joke I did in 2002 on my second CD.  Like, oh, God, they're going to kill me after.  Right.  Nobody gives a shit.  No.  My manager doesn't even recognize it.  No.  Is that new?  No, idiot.  I'm talking about Schwarzenegger as the governor.  How new could it be?  Do you, what do you, right before you walk out, like, what is,  going, like, are you putting yourself in any kind of a, are you like, hey, just make  sure my coffee's ready?  Or are you getting yourself into a complete vibe of some sort? 
[03:13:30]  No, I'm just pretty much calm.  Usually what I'm trying to do is, I always have that moment.  I bet you guys have this where you're like, I cannot remember the first line to the first  song.  Oh, man.  And you're like, the music's going.  Like, okay, the song's going.  I'm going to be coming in in any minute.  Holy shit.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And right when it's right, then somehow your brain remembers.  The second that music.  If I sit there and I'm thinking about it, I'm like, I have no idea what the words of  the song are.  It's a scary thing.  And I'll go from bit to bit sometimes and not remember. 
[03:14:00]  And here's how you know I have no idea where I'm going.  Fuck, man.  You guys are good tonight.  Oh, God, God, please.  Sip of water.  Sip of water.  And then I just kind of go, I just slow myself down a little bit.  And then I kind of figure out where I got to go.  Because usually I'm coming out of, like, there's some doors that open under the drum  riser or something.  And I'm always, every night I go, I got to write the words down to the first song so I  can read it.  Of course, I forget to do that every night for the last 20 years.  But it's still, like, it's amazing how there's a part of your brain that just is working on 
[03:14:30]  it without you being in charge.  Like, you're just like, I'll be in the middle of a joke sometimes and think, wait, I don't  know where this is going.  And then it just comes, pops out of your mouth.  And it's because there's a different part of your brain that's just, I got this.  You think about your laundry.  Well, it's also, too, when you try to remember lyrics or you try to remember comedy bits,  you think of the first word.  Like, okay, that's this and that's that.  But usually in your brain, what takes you is the last word of one thought takes you  into the first word of the next thought.  It's not the first word to the first word.  Right.  And you're trying to block out all the booing and silence. 
[03:15:00]  Exactly.  Like, I want to give a really boring...  A sea of disappointment.  Yeah.  Just the expectant faces all thinking of refunds.  I hate that when I see the cameras up, though, for comedy, because it's like they're going  to put it online and then people are going to hear the joke.  But again, like you said, it gets six views.  It's like nobody gives it.  I act like all of YouTube wants to see Jim Norton's new bit.  Where are you going?  That's not fucking Justin Bieber recording it.  I have an appointment right now.  I have to step out for a couple of minutes.  Oh, shit.  Who are you going to talk to?  That's more than your friend, Rob Zahn. 
[03:15:30]  Another show.  It's a show business thing.  But I'll be right back.  Are you going to hang out, guys?  We have our meeting.  We have our meeting a few minutes.  Yeah, we got our meeting.  We're going to end on time today.  Eight minutes left, Tom.  What are you doing right now?  You can wait eight minutes.  Your phone call is obviously at 10.  Oh, he's got a radio phoner.  A radio phoner.  Yeah, but they're probably 6 to 10 in the morning.  It's probably Pete Dominick.  He's calling down the hall.  These guys suck.  Here he goes.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Tom Popper.  You can do it on the air and do two shows at once.  That would be awesome.  Yeah, we've done that before. 
[03:16:00]  You want to do that?  You don't want me to.  You don't want me to.  I don't feel like masturbating in front of you.  Yeah, it would be.  Do you like directing comedy?  I do, yeah.  I mean, I love comedy.  I mean, I love being part of it.  I mean, I don't...  I think sometimes you always love the stuff that you feel like you can't do.  Right.  Like, you can understand it, and you get it, and you can appreciate it, but you couldn't do it.  They say when actors meet, like, athletes, like, when Kareem would meet Nicholson, like,  all Kareem wanted to talk about was acting, and all Nicholson wanted to talk about was basketball. 
[03:16:30]  I believe that to be true, because especially, I think, for people that are...  If you're naturally good at something, it doesn't seem probably...  I don't know.  Especially athletes.  I mean, I guess athletes have to be sort of naturally good at something to be professional.  They're probably, like, bored with the, oh, yeah, I know, I'm super fast.  But you...  Yeah, great.  Yeah.  You're funny.  Look what you do.  What do you do on downtime?  Like, you're a really busy guy.  I don't know.  I don't have any downtime.  Really?  It's a thing, trying to do all these projects.  My last downtime was... 
[03:17:00]  I finally had a break, and I ended up doing Tom's thing.  See?  So you're working anyway?  Yeah.  You don't just hang around, maybe glue together a model?  No, it's really funny.  Catch up on a box set of a TV show?  I feel like I...  You know how it is.  It's like you just...  The opportunity comes up, and you're like...  Okay, I'll do it.  Yeah, yeah.  So you're like, oh, crap, that's this week, isn't it?  Yeah, that's drive, man.  Holy shit.  You're always busy.  You're always fucking doing shit. 
[03:17:30]  God, sometimes it's just...  I think you get this paranoid fear.  I mean, I think this business breeds it, because you work so hard to get someplace that when  it's happening, you feel like if you start saying no to stuff...  Uh-huh.  Remember that last time I said no nine months ago, and no one ever asked the question since  time?  You know, something, you know?  Yeah.  You feel lucky to be getting the work, or lucky to be doing and creating and just continuing  to do so.  Yeah, I mean, because there's no guarantee.  That's the one thing with this type of job, you know, weird way to put it, but there's  no guarantee. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  There's no guarantee that it's going to keep going.  I mean, it probably will after a certain point.  You can feel kind of comfortable, but, you know...  No coasting.  That's why, you know, I mean, I always took the point of view that, especially in the  rock business, that's why most people seem like they end up broke.  They kind of live their lives like, this is never going to end.  Yeah.  And I would always live it sort of from the point of view of like, I don't know why this  is happening, but it's probably going to be overshaming.  So I better be smart about this.  Yeah, sock the money away and be fucking...  He's got a lot more money in the bank, then.  Yeah, it's smart.  So that's a good way to live.  Because too many guys blow through everything they make, and it's like, then they're fucking 50 
[03:18:30]  or 60 years old, they got nothing.  Yeah, I mean, because it's tough, because you see it, and I've seen it so much,  and it's sad, because with most things, especially in music, it seems like you have your, this  sounds so cheesy to say, but there's like that peak earning time period where like it's  hitting, say like when CDs were big, and you could literally make so much money, but now  that's gone, that revenue streams.  Okay, so you're not making money off CDs, and now you're back to playing clubs, and this  and that, and suddenly it's like, uh, how am I going to build back that fortune I wasted? 
[03:19:00]  I tap dance at the end of fucking selling merchandise and signings, which you can't do when  you're in an arena, or when you're in a small theater or comedy club.  I fucking, I'll talk to everybody on the way out.  And you know who brought that up recently?  It was David Lee Roth in here.  About?  Where it all went away.  All right, all right.  And he was playing, he said he got used to playing state fairs.  David Lee Roth, Van Halen.  Yeah.  Holy fuck, they were playing to the world for so many years.  But it seems like there's a comeback if guys hang around long enough and they're good.  There's like a lot of times those valleys, but a lot of times people start to crave it again. 
[03:19:30]  You get a long valley, though.  Yeah, I have a theory.  My theory is that when you're in your sort of like late 30s to mid 40s, that's the bad  time.  Because like when you're young and new, it's like everyone's excited.  Then you're kind of like, yeah, you've been kicking around.  We're used to you.  Whatever.  Right.  But then if you get a little bit past that, if you can survive that, then like suddenly  you're a legendary.  There is a legend.  Yeah.  The legend has arrived.  But it's that middle ground where you're sort of the kind of old guy we're sick of. 
[03:20:00]  I remember that guy.  Sure hope we're legends, Ant.  Well, you see it with everybody.  It was like, say, you know, like an Aussie or anybody.  There seems like that mid 40s time period where people kind of take the person for granted.  Then suddenly it's like they rise up to this whole other giant level.  And all music, it's crazy.  You know what Aussie did that was smart, I mean, it was the fact that he always embraced  really good young bands.  Like he took Metallica out when they were fucking on fire, Motley Crue, You Gotley. 
[03:20:30]  He never shied away from young, hot talent.  No, he always stayed youthful.  Yeah.  Like his band, the guys in his band and the whole way he would surround himself, it never  seemed like he was like some guy that started in the late 60s.  Right.  It always seemed very current, you know, whereas a lot of his contemporaries seem like just  everyone they're playing with has like gray short hair.  They're gone, yeah, yeah.  Fucking jazz drummer.  But then again, it's kind of a, it kind of goes along with what we said.  I mean, you watch some bands and, you know, it was like, I was watching this thing.  It was like, I don't know what it was. 
[03:21:00]  It was like a Gibson guitar concert and it was all these guitar players.  And, you know, Ron Wood came out.  Ron Wood was probably the oldest guy on stage, but he's thin.  He looks great.  He's dressed super cool.  And I'm like, fuck, he looks fucking, I mean, he looks old.  But he still looks like fucking badass.  Ron Wood.  Right.  And then the other guys that came out, and I don't want to say they're there, but they're  like, they got fat.  They're wearing shorts, sandals, a Hawaiian shirt.  You go, this guy used to be fucking badass.  Look at him.  But then Ron Wood proves that it doesn't matter.  Right.  He's still amazing, you know. 
[03:21:30]  But then the other guy looks like your dad's like, hey, I got a band on the weekend.  Come see us, Jim.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I guess the Stones fucking have managed to look just good through all this time.  Always.  They're incredible.  I want to ask you about Broad Street Bullies.  I didn't know you were a hockey fan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the next project.  I'm excited about that.  Me too.  That's a different one.  Where are we at with that?  Well, the script is finally finished.  That was sort of a big project in itself just because, you know, every script I've done  has been a fictitious thing. 
[03:22:00]  You can just make up crazy stuff.  But that was a lot of research.  A lot of research digging that one out.  What type of angle are you taking on that?  Well, I mean, it's really – it starts with the formation of the Flyers because just the  formation of the team as one of the first expansion teams is a crazy story up to when  they win the Stanley Cup in 74.  Right on, man.  And that's – I mean, I –  That was a crazy group of guys.  It's a crazy story too.  There's just so much stuff that just seems fake. 
[03:22:30]  It seems like I just made it up.  I think that's going to do really well.  I've never heard of them because I'm not a big hockey guy, so I'd be interested to  see that.  That was the nickname of the team in the 70s leading up to the Stanley Cup.  Were they brawlers?  Oh, God.  I mean, basically what it was was one day, Ed Snyder, who owned the team, the Flyers were  a new team and they were just getting brutalized, like literally brutalized by other teams  on the ice because they had – they just had, as he put it, a bunch of little French  guys out there on the ice.  And he's like, I don't care if we're the best skaters or shooters. 
[03:23:00]  I want to build the toughest team that ever has ever played hockey.  And that's essentially what they set out to do.  And –  And they accomplished it.  They just –  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I mean, there was something coming up out there.  The Philly flu, they would always talk about where players from other teams would suddenly  get the flu when they went to Philly because they didn't want to play them.  They didn't want to get their teeth knocked out.  Oh, wow.  They fought every fucking game.  How good were they?  Oh, and then they wanted to shut the cup on twice.  No, Rob makes a great point.  They ended up being a really good team, but you know what?  It was an expansion team, so you're just trying to throw whoever you could find together. 
[03:23:30]  So you found that making – writing this at least was a lot different because you had  to stick to a certain amount of facts.  Well, yeah.  I wanted it to be truthful and I wanted it to be very detailed, but I mean, if you – with  a movie like this, most of the information is just the facts of the games and stuff, but  trying to just dig out the information on the team.  But it's cool.  It's there.  Did you have access to the players?  Did you talk to them?  Yeah, I did.  I mean, I went to Philly and was hanging out with the players.  But it's funny because, you know, they won the cup like 74, so it's like almost 40 years  ago. 
[03:24:00]  And most of the team was still at the game.  And it's like, you know, like Bernie Perrant was there and Joe Watson and Gary Dornhofer.  I mean, it's like there's still legendary guys in that building 40 years later.  It was amazing.  Have you shot a timepiece yet?  Like where you have to have everything – like for there, you better – every car,  every shot better be 1974 or earlier.  Yeah, I did.  My second movie, Devil's Rejects, was set in 77, I think.  Was there any mistakes with consistency that you look back at?  Like, oh, fuck, I didn't realize there was an iPhone on the table in that shot. 
[03:24:30]  I don't think so.  I didn't – I think we were – I think that's correct.  I'm always amazed that there are guys out there that will look for that.  There might be something that I don't want.  Those picky Pete's.  But I'm fascinated with like the set designers and stuff that pull this off and everything  just looks organic.  I'm like, you know how hard that is in this day and age to get a whole block to look like  it's 1975?  I know, it gets harder and harder, too, as time goes on because, you know, luckily  some of these neighborhoods, like even if you go down Lower East Side, change out the  cars, it looks like it's 1960 and the buildings and nothing's changed.  I actually saw one on the Upper East Side recently.  Half a block looked like it was right out of the fucking 70s and then literally right 
[03:25:00]  out of the camera was brand new cars and people dressed like today.  Really strange.  And you drive sometimes and think, what would I have not seen 20 years ago?  Like there are certain digital signs and then you'll get like a little stretch where  you're like, this all looks like it did when I was younger.  But then you'll just hit like this sign for iPhone or iPad.  To fuck up something?  Yeah.  Or some kind of a...  Digitally remove it.  Oh, you can.  That's what they do mostly.  Yeah.  Well, we got a meeting to go to, unfortunately.  Oh, the final question. 
[03:25:30]  Where's...  I know you're early on, but when is that movie coming out?  Broad Street.  I don't know.  I mean, I got a lot of touring now, so we'll probably start shooting it late in the  year.  So it's still a ways away.  A few days away, yeah.  It's a big project, so...  Yeah, obviously.  Okay.  And we got...  Let's promote properly.  Rob is promoting the Lords of Salem.  It opens...  It's a limited release April 19th, which is this Friday.  And the new CD is called Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor.  Fucking fantastic name.  And it's out April 23rd. 
[03:26:00]  Of course, all the real fans have pre-ordered it.  Sam.  The pretenders have not.  That's what I hear.  That's what I hear, yeah.  Yeah.  Sam's like a...  Fairweather fan.  Yeah.  Wait till it comes out.  Yeah.  My friend makes a copy.  Robzombie.com.  And, of course, RWzombie on Twitter.  Where do you even go if you want to buy one?  What's that?  I want to go buy one.  Where would I even go?  Dude, I drove by where Tower Records used to be down on 3rd Street.  All gone.  Yeah.  I still love Tower Records.  Everything's gone.  I kind of like the digital age, too, though.  Like, I like the fact that I can think of a song, and just because we were talking about 
[03:26:30]  that Beach Boys song, you like it.  I could just fucking get it on my phone and have it.  No, we get the convenience, but just going through a record bin used to be kind of cool,  you know?  Newberry Comics on Newberry Street.  Yeah.  You could do it there, still.  But they're one of the last places.  The convenience is cool because of that reason.  Yeah.  But the other thing is cool just because sometimes I like that experience of, like, I don't know  what I'm looking for.  Right.  But on iTunes, you kind of have to know what you're looking for.  That's true.  You can't shuffle through and go, wow, what's this?  This is badass.  And all of a sudden, you find a surprise, like, oh, fuck.  What's the smell of a CD booklet? 
[03:27:00]  What's better than the smell of a CD booklet?  Pussy.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  That's true.  CD booklet comes in 40.  Pizza.  I don't know.  A lot of things.  Pizza.  Exactly.  Fair enough.  That's banana.  That's coffee.  All right.  Well, CD booklet comes after Melba Toast and before Rockhead.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Hey, Jimmy, you're going to be in Baltimore, too.  Yeah, I'm in the Goobies Friday, Saturday.  I've got four shows.  The Goobies?  Yeah.  I couldn't be prouder to say that.  Yeah.  In front of Rob Zombie.  Yeah, McGooby's fucking joke house.  I'll be there fucking prostituting myself. 
[03:27:30]  Well, I feel your pain because all the arenas now have names like that.  Yeah, that's true.  Like, there's literally one we play.  It's called the 1-800-ASK-GARY Arena.  Oh, Jesus.  That could be the worst name ever.  Yeah.  Especially for us.  Dental Clinic.  You're going to ask them.  Why?  Most of them are fucking the Verizon Wireless.  Yeah, or the Capital One building.  Yeah, it's all right.  But that's all right.  You could deal with that in a weird way.  Madison Square Garden or fucking Mental Land.  They used to have great names.  Shit like that, yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get Rob out of here.  And then it becomes a tourist center.  Yeah.  Actually, yeah.  That actually will.  Yankee Stadium are like the two holdouts.  Or Texas Stadium, I think, for the Cowboys.  Yeah, there's not many.  But they're offering way too much money to change the names.  How do you say no to City Field?  Fucking $80 million, whatever they paid?  I think it was, yeah.  I just made that figure up.  It was probably a lot higher, if you want to really get into it.  All right.  We're done for the day.  Good to see you all.  Thanks, Rob.  See you tomorrow.  Yep, yep, yep. 
[03:28:30]  After O.B. and Anthony Live.  There's not that many people I like more than Rob Zombie.  I've got to be honest.  Not that many people.  I've been to Rob Zombie fans since I was in, like, seventh grade.  He hasn't been in the studio in a long time, either.  When was the last time he did the O&A show? 
[03:29:00]  K-Rock.  That was it, right?  He did it once at K-Rock, and he hasn't been...  No, you did something here with him.  Well, I've interviewed him a couple times.  Yeah.  Since then, I think.  But I don't think he's done O&A since K-Rock.  You interviewed him at Comic-Con.  I interviewed him at Comic-Con, but then...  That's the last...  I remember, I've interviewed him, I think, two times up here.  Because the first time I ever got to sit down and interview him, Jess and me were supposed  to be going to Disney World, and we had all the plans, and everything was laid out.  And we find out, like, Annabella, the talent booker, she came up to me, and she goes... 
[03:29:30]  Because O&A were on vacation.  And so Annabella goes, hey, Rob Zombie and his wife are going to be in town.  O&A aren't here.  And this was before I had my show.  I was doing something, I'm sure, but I wasn't doing a lot of interviews.  Like, now, I'm interviewing people for the show every week.  You know, back then, I wasn't doing a lot of interviews.  So it was a very exciting premise.  DJ Hookett just stopped by.  We had Rob Zombie up here.  You know, are you a Rob Zombie guy?  You aware of Rob Zombie?  Yeah, I'm very well aware. 
[03:30:00]  Why?  He's, like, my worst interview of all time.  You didn't go well?  No, I mean, I interviewed him, like, years ago for...  That's what I mean.  ...fucking Halloween.  And it did not go well?  It was the worst.  Him and his wife.  I had him and his wife on my show.  That must have been the same day.  It was years ago, because I was saying, you did not...  I love him.  Can I show you something, Who Kid?  Yeah.  This may affect you.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's his logo tattooed on my arm.  I got that when I was in college.  You are crazy, man. 
[03:30:30]  What?  A little while after that, I got him to sign it and then tattooed that on.  What?  Yeah.  That's Jack White under there.  You did not do that.  Yeah, that's his real autograph.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I tattooed it on after.  It was when the Educated Horses album was out.  And I went to an autograph signing.  Yeah.  I got him to sign my arm.  Went to his show that night.  And you had it tattooed.  And then the next morning, went to a tattoo place and got him to go over it.  That's kind of ill.  It's kind of ill, right?  It's not too pussy, is it? 
[03:31:00]  I think I got him on a bad day.  I mean, not fuck him.  Well, he's known, Tom Papa was in here just talking about him earlier.  He's not, for a lot of times, he can be a difficult interview.  Yeah.  Like, for me, I think he knew I was a fan, so I know everything about him.  So it was easy.  He probably likes that, like, I'm just this weirdo who's got his name tattooed on me.  Because I showed him when I interviewed him.  I mean, he probably wants to fuck you.  Do you think so?  He got his tattoo.  I mean, I guess I would if he wanted to.  If he brought it up.  I'm not a fan. 
[03:31:30]  Roland, would you suck Rob Zombie's dick?  He probably would.  Yeah, if we're booking, yeah, why not?  Times are tough.  You would, right?  Most celebrities.  You have to keep all celebrities booking.  I'll do any celebrity.  But so here's what happened.  And I think this was even before me and you were really hanging out.  This was years ago.  Because, like I said, I wasn't doing a lot of interviews.  Okay.  And Annabella, the talent booker, was like,  O&A are on vacation.  Do you want to interview Rob Zombie and his wife?  And I was like, yes.  Oh, so you interviewed him too?  Right.  But at that point, that was like a dream come true. 
[03:32:00]  It wasn't like.  Get the fuck.  So it was good for you then?  Well, yeah, it was great.  But what I had to do was I had to call up Jess, my wife,  and be like, look, I know we booked travel to go to Disney World.  We got to push it back a day.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  We got to push.  We got to push.  She was like, we're leaving in four days.  What do you mean?  I go, no, no, no.  We have to push it back a day.  You deaded Harry Potter World for fucking Rob Zombie.  Fuck you, man.  Yeah.  So we had to push everything back.  And I ran up in here to get the interviews done. 
[03:32:30]  But it was such a thrill.  I mean, I'm a Halloween fan.  Every black person is.  Yeah.  Everybody loves Halloween.  Which is weird because black people are so afraid of music.  Yeah.  I mean, magic.  Magic.  Music.  Black people are so afraid of magic.  We're scared of horror flicks, period.  Because, you know, the black dude don't go in the dark area.  Only white people do.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, I'm not going to check shit.  Let me go check.  But that's your job in the horror movies.  The black guy is.  He has to go check shit.  And then he's the one who dies.  Yeah.  He's the one friend that he convinced.  Of course.  They always killed a black guy real quick. 
[03:33:00]  But all I was talking about is his wife stripping in the fucking movie.  Oh, he probably wouldn't have liked that.  That's the best part of that whole movie.  I know.  But don't you have a sense of when you're talking to somebody to not keep going after they're  obviously.  Like, when you throw something at someone, right?  Yeah.  And you know, especially if it's their wife stripping.  And you're like, in your head, you're going, this will be a funny thing to talk about.  I told him I had a hard-on.  Yeah, I know.  I had a hard-on over your wife.  You throw that at somebody.  It can go one of two ways.  Like, for me, I'd be like, oh, that's so nice of you. 
[03:33:30]  Thank you for saying that.  I guess I married out of my league.  What a wonderful.  Let's talk.  Tell me more about your hard-on.  His wife was happy.  She was like, hee, hee, hee, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  But for Rob Zombie, he was like, how about we don't talk about this?  Fuck you.  Well.  But instead of your style.  Exactly.  Instead of being like, I'm going to move on to the next thing then.  And kind of bring.  No, I stayed there.  You stayed there.  I was like, yo, the strip, the movement, the going around the pole, it was crazy.  Yeah.  She's a slut, I guess.  I don't know.  No, she's not a slut. 
[03:34:00]  In the movie.  Maybe her character.  But that's what I enjoyed.  I didn't care about, you know.  Michael Myers.  The mask and the sister running and all that bullshit.  But he's done so much.  You couldn't have brought up his music.  It was like the prequel, right?  It was like they went back in time.  They added some prequel.  Did you see the movie, Who Kid?  Tell me the truth.  I mean, I saw a little bit of it.  You didn't see it.  Did you tell me?  You saw what I saw the previous.  Right.  Did you watch Beyond the Stripper part?  Nope.  No.  You didn't see it.  You didn't check out the movie.  I like the original Halloween.  Yeah.  You know.  That's why I'm always eating the Activia. 
[03:34:30]  Like, I love Activia.  I stay with Activia by ass.  You put it.  You're not supposed to put it in your ass.  It's supposed to help you clean out your things.  I know, but you eat it.  No, no.  You eat it.  And then it clears your throat.  Yeah, it's yogurt.  She told me to put it in my ass.  Who, Jamie Lee Curtis?  When I had her last time.  She was fucking with you.  You had a good interview with her.  Yeah, that was gangster.  So Rob Zombie was maybe your worst interview.  Yeah, all time.  I interviewed over 800 people up here in the nine years I've been here.  Like, every star. 
[03:35:00]  And he was, like, he's the only one that was whack.  That is so funny, because it was, as I was saying, like, when I interviewed him for the  first time, it's very early into my interview career.  Now, I'm like you, who kid?  Me and you are up here interviewing people on the daily.  You know what I'm saying?  But back then, I wasn't doing interviews.  And so when they're, like, you know, you're idle from when you were a kid.  That's crazy.  You have his name tattooed on your arm.  Can you explode?  You can interview.  Yeah, I came in my pants a little bit.  I knew it, yeah.  A little bit.  But that doesn't make me pussy, does it?  Yeah, he's a pussy.  Oh, man.  You're a fallopian tube. 
[03:35:30]  But so I guess I didn't realize what a risk I was running of, like, when you meet somebody  you're a fan of, and they turn out to be a dick.  Because to me, he wasn't a dick.  To me, he was awesome.  And then I interviewed him, and he was awesome.  And the whole thing was just fantastic.  I was like, what a great experience this has been.  Was your wife happy for you?  She understands.  But you weren't married at that time.  Huh?  You weren't married at that time.  No, but I was dating her.  Oh, okay.  And long-term dating.  Dicking it down.  I was digging or dicking? 
[03:36:00]  Dicking it down.  Dicking it.  Yeah, I was dicking it down at the time.  You know, I was dicking it down and heading to Florida and everything.  But I don't think I've ever had that experience where the only time Jess said that she took  a little bit of umbrage with Rob Zombie once, and I thought this was funny when he did it.  So for the record, I was like, okay, he should be making fun of me a little bit.  Okay.  Because before I got to interview him, this was when he was at K-Rock, when he did Opie  and Anthony, for the first time while I was working there, I had met him at the signing 
[03:36:30]  when I got my arm signed, and I had talked to him at Comic-Con that Roland had set up.  Oh, wow.  And that was a fucking thrill in my lifetime at that point in my life.  I mean, that was crazy.  Damn.  But I printed out the photos that I had taken with him, so I had two, right?  And I asked him to sign them in the green room, and he was like, okay.  And I was like, could you sign this one, too?  And there's another picture of him and me, and he goes, okay, and he signs it. 
[03:37:00]  And then Eric is standing there with the camera, and I go, hey, would you mind taking a photo?  Eric, do you remember this moment?  Yeah, I said, hold the photo up.  Yeah, but he goes, you know what Rob said?  He goes, yeah, of course.  And he stands next to me, and he puts his fist up for the photo, and then he goes, I don't  know what's going to make this one any different from the last two you got.  I was just like, oh, shit.  I took a photo with his wife only.  I didn't even have him on the shot.  You asked him, please, could you step aside, Mr. Zombie? 
[03:37:30]  You know what I'm saying?  You're a son of a bitch.  Don't ever disrespect the zombie family like that.  If I had had one more question with him today, I would have asked him, why no zombie babies?  Why no little zombie kids running around?  I think the world needs another generation of zombies.  I don't think he likes jokes, because he was very serious about that movie, and I think  the movie got bad ratings at that time, because the prequel was kind of iffy.  It ended up doing well, but he was saying, yeah, he was saying today that at first it  was like iffy, iffy.  But we don't bring that up in the interview, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:38:00]  No.  It's supposed to be a good time.  Who's we?  No, when they come on your show.  Oh, we interviewers.  Yeah, we're not supposed to be like, yo, I heard the movie's whack, but hopefully everybody  sees it.  You're not going to say that.  Like, I'm hearing terrible things about the movie.  Is that upsetting to you?  Exactly.  You'd be like, yes, yes, yes!  Why would you ask that question?  But he just got, like, you know, bad reviews and some, you know, I guess, he got that info,  so he come on my show, and I'm joking, I'm talking about his wife's pussy for an hour. 
[03:38:30]  Right, and he's like, I don't want to talk about that anymore.  My movie's about to bomb, right?  But then it didn't.  It didn't, obviously, but he wasn't feeling too happy.  I think he also, Rob Zombie, this is one of the reasons I like him.  Rob Zombie strikes me as the type of guy who just surrounds himself with what he likes  and what likes him, and beyond that, he doesn't want it in his world.  He doesn't want it, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, he's not interested in listening to anybody who doesn't like him.  Yeah.  He's not interested in listening to people who don't like his ideas, you know what I mean? 
[03:39:00]  He has a vision, and you can either follow that vision with him, and usually it's a good  vision.  Of course.  I got all his albums, I got all his movies.  He's a fucking smart guy.  That's the vision sound.  Yeah.  Or, you know, he doesn't want you around him.  So I feel like when he comes in to do interviews, and a lot of guys are like, I mean, and you  can tell, you know, the way Tom Papa was describing his house.  He wants all kinds of horror movie posters everywhere and all this stuff.  He likes, and he's working all the time. 
[03:39:30]  He's a guy who likes...  I mean, he's an incredible musician.  Like, come on.  Right.  Can't sleep on him.  He's a guy who likes to have what's him around him all the time.  What he likes around him.  So I feel like when he comes in to do interviews, he doesn't know when he walks in if it's going  to be like a crazy little fanboy geek like me.  And he likes that, because if you're a fanboy geek, then you're down.  He's probably happy because he probably would never be able to fuck his wife.  He probably thought I had an option.  I don't think that was the problem, Hoot Kid.  You don't think so? 
[03:40:00]  No.  I think his wife and him are committed to each other, and they're in a loving relationship.  His wife looked like she had black dick before.  No, I don't think so, Hoot Kid.  Okay.  I don't think so.  Maybe I assume too much.  And I think that that's what happens.  Sometimes he walks into interviews, and he ends up sitting across the table from a fucking  asshole.  DJ Hoot Kid.  I didn't have a bone in her.  He saw it, too.  He probably asked.  I heard your booty about your bum.  Is that true?  He saw my shit.  He saw your shit?  I said, what are you looking at?  That's not true.  My Michael Bayer.  I don't believe that for a second.  This is turning into a horror movie. 
[03:40:30]  Marshall in Texas.  Hey, Sammy.  You're a pro bro, dude.  I'm a pro bro?  Professional broadcaster.  I like that.  That's like some Covino-enrich terminology.  A pro bro.  Professional broadcaster.  Pro dude bro.  You've got the tattoo and everything.  Shit, dude.  I kept freaking out because you sounded like Steve C with testosterone.  With testosterone, it's true.  Without that sort of weird lispy thing that Steve C always had. 
[03:41:00]  Rob Zombie has this crazy, like, announcer-y voice.  Oh, get out of here.  Yeah.  You talk to him.  What do you mean get out of here?  Let's get ready to rumble.  No, like a voiceover guy.  If he wasn't doing this, he could do radio production or something.  He's just got this, like, you know.  Everything he does is great, Alan Flick Jr.  His wife got a nice mouth, too.  Why would you bring up his wife again?  DJ Hoot Kid.  I love his wife.  I understand.  Sherry Moon Zombie is a beautiful- that's her name.  She's a beautiful woman.  She's also very, very talented. 
[03:41:30]  She can dance.  Got a nice mouth.  She can act.  Nice mouth.  All right.  We're not talking about that.  That throat.  God damn it.  Michael in Georgia.  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  Good morning.  I was good until Hoot Kid came in and started making trouble.  I was talking about her uterus.  God damn it.  This is why people-  Now you get it.  This is turning into your worst interview ever.  This one with me right here.  Quit busting Hoot Kid's balls.  I'll tell you, he's balls.  He's busting.  Yeah.  Hey, how much ass do I have to kiss to get a T-shirt today? 
[03:42:00]  I'll tell you what, Michael.  We're going to send you a T-shirt and a mixtape.  How about that?  That's hot.  I would love it, as long as it makes the shirt extra fat.  And, all right, since you're a fat guy, I don't know if the T-shirt will fit, but to  make it better, I will send you Opie's finished Sudoku puzzle of the day.  Get the fuck out of here.  Today's note, and this is a special one.  Today's note says, play Dirty Water by the Strandells.  That's a little note to himself.  Remember when he did that on the show today, E-Rock? 
[03:42:30]  Yes.  He wrote it on this thing.  I'm going to send it to you, Michael.  I appreciate it.  All right, hold on.  He finished that puzzle, yo?  Yeah, who could, Opie's got a new thing.  The smart motherfucker.  Well, it's not that, when he, he sits here while the show is on.  Not during commercial breaks.  No way, he does it.  While the show is on.  Get the fuck out of here.  And who could, we don't play music.  Smart motherfucker, yo.  While there's talking and everything happening.  Maybe, maybe Rob Zombie interview helped him out.  Like yesterday, yesterday, Jim and Anthony were talking about Trayvon Martin for like an 
[03:43:00]  hour and a half.  Get out of here.  So like, Opie could have probably finished 14 Sudoku puzzles in that amount of time.  He finds his moments, and he completes them successfully.  Like you said, U-Kid.  Smart motherfucker.  He's a smart motherfucker.  Thursday's going to be a tough one, though.  A lot of guests.  Who's coming in on Thursday?  Trayvon Martin's coming in?  Kevin Smith, Jason Hughes.  Okay, Jay and Silent Bob.  I don't know, is Trayvon coming in, or?  No.  He's deceased, isn't he? 
[03:43:30]  Well, we have something, yes.  Right, right.  We have Tom Sizemore.  Tom Sizemore.  Yeah.  Jay Silent Bob, Tom Sizemore, all the drug addicts here coming in.  And then Ricky Gervais.  Wow.  It's like Crackhead Weekend or something.  That is a big Thursday.  I don't know if Ricky Gervais is technically a Crackhead.  I don't think so.  But if you had that line-up, who kid, you would call it Crackhead Thursday?  You know, sniff the line.  I don't know.  Maniac.  I read Obi's tweet, too.  He was saying there's no, like, responses to what black people do to white people. 
[03:44:00]  You know, I was bugging when I saw that.  What do you mean?  You know how they always, like, tweet, like, the atrocities that they do to black people?  Black people get shot or killed, but there's no black violence towards the white people.  You don't see that.  The dude's too tough.  Oh, I understand what you're saying.  You know what I'm saying?  So I saw that tweet out.  You know, the white in me, I felt so, like, happy.  And you'll side more with Anthony on this.  You're more of a white supremacist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You are?  Of course.  You get to know that, DJ.  I'm not just Anthony. 
[03:44:30]  Anthony in Florida.  Different Anthony.  Anthony in Florida, you are not a white supremacist, correct?  Thank you for clarification.  I'm not a white supremacist.  No, I haven't chosen a party.  Thank you.  I was calling about, you were talking about, like, me.  The fear of meeting a celebrity that you like and being disappointed.  Oh, by the way, primetime food kid, what's up?  How you doing?  What up, son?  Good to talk to you.  What up, kid?  So, yes, I met a celebrity, and circumstantially, it just kind of let me down because he was kind 
[03:45:00]  of a dick.  But I don't know if you want to name names.  Name names.  Yeah, put the name out there.  Yeah, this is what this show is.  All right, you guys know the band Anthrax?  Of course.  Okay, yeah, I'm a big, I like Anthrax.  And I met Anthrax after a concert in Orlando at one of the venues.  I think it was House of Blues.  And they had a folding table set up.  And all the band members were there.  I got some autographs and stuff.  But at the time, I was kind of trying to learn, like, rhythm guitar.  And I made the mistake saying, hey, Scott, you know, just want to let you know, you're  a huge inspiration, man. 
[03:45:30]  I'm really, you know, I'm trying to learn this guitar stuff.  And, yeah, I love your stuff.  And he just shot me this look, like, what the fuck are you saying?  Really?  He had an angry look in his eyes.  But you know what?  So I kind of walked away from that, like, oh, bummer, man.  So Scott Ian was a dick to you.  Damn, that's fucked up.  To some degree.  You know, here's what I figured.  They used to play, like, Madison Square Garden.  And at the time, this was, like, five years ago, they were playing, like, House of Blues, 
[03:46:00]  which is a real small bench.  So I'm thinking maybe Ian is used to playing in front of thousands of 15,000, 20,000 people.  I'm thinking about it.  I'm like, well, I didn't piss him off, you know.  Yeah, so that's why I wanted to share that story with you guys.  You should have flipped the folding table.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fuck you.  You know what I'm saying?  Have you ever met anybody?  I mean.  We're so tough right now.  Yeah, well, that's because we don't have to face these people face-to-face.  Have you ever, you've interviewed, I've been lucky, I think.  Because I can't think of anybody.  I mean, that's it. 
[03:46:30]  I've interviewed everybody, had a great time.  Rob Zombie's the only interview that was fucked up.  He was kind of a dick.  I can't think of anybody that I've ever encountered that's been a dick.  Everybody's been cool.  Yeah, it's weird.  Because you always hear that, Roland, you've encountered a lot of celebrities.  Can you name anybody that kind of disappointed you?  Maybe before you were with Carson, so it's before you signed the non-disclosures.  Maybe when you were a kid or something.  Because Roland's got stories upon stories, but he's not allowed to tell any of them.  I need to tell you when I'm drunk. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Which is most of the time.  Yeah.  I'm probably just sports athletes, basically, when I was a kid.  Yeah, athletes are assholes, right?  The hockey players, the LA Kings, when I was a kid, the nicest people in the world.  Then I love the Dodgers.  And I waited for an autograph.  And I went, Fernando, you're my father.  They're laughing because he's Mexican, I'm Mexican.  Yeah.  So he came up and took off his hat and just chewed me away.  Really?  Yeah, when he signed my ball.  Get the fuck out of here.  See, like, all the UFC fighters and the wrestlers have been cool. 
[03:47:30]  And Kyle Ripken was cool in here.  The football players were real nice.  Chris Kardashian dissed me.  Chris Kardashian, the mom?  I mean, well, Chris Humphries, but we call him Chris Humphries.  Big faggot.  What did Chris Humphries do?  Nah, because I had to DJ their fake wedding party that they did in the city somewhere.  Was it after their fake wedding?  No, they were married, but they did marriage parties everywhere.  Oh, crushed it.  Yeah, so they did one in the city, so I DJed that. 
[03:48:00]  But he never met me.  I'm cool with the Kardashians.  So I went up to him and said, what's up?  He also knows that he, at that time, had married a woman who had a history of enjoying the darker, you know, dick, if you will.  He pushed me away.  He did.  He was like, whatever, pal.  I was like, oh, shit.  So I told Kim Kardashian.  He thought you were just like a fan or something.  Yeah, but meanwhile, I'm DJing the party.  Everybody's wiggling.  Ooh.  Ooh.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  I 100% know what you're saying.  Fuck him, yo.  And then fucking, I told Kim Kardashian, and all of a sudden, Kim ran up to him. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, she grabbed by the ear.  Take this fucking picture with who, kid?  Uh, I'm sorry, Kim.  I got the photo, too.  I didn't know that was too, kid.  I'm sorry.  Yo, Scott Disick, like, ripped his asshole up.  Scott, that's the other boyfriend, right?  He ripped the shit out of his ass.  Scott, I didn't know, Scott.  She was like, take this fucking photo with who, kid, right fucking now.  He's a dumb guy, isn't he? 
[03:49:00]  He's a stupid fuck.  He is, right?  Fuck him.  He's a member.  He is.  Alan, you're not the smartest guy.  Can you pick up on the fact that Chris Humphries is a stupid guy?  Yeah.  You can.  Good for you.  He looks stupid.  Good for you.  Alan?  No, no, Chris Humphries.  He's cool.  He's a guy.  He's fucked a black girl.  He's all right.  Oh, the guy I was about to talk to just hung up.  We'll go to Bob in PA.  What's up, Bob?  Yeah, Sam.  Nice.  Happy.  It's my birthday today.  Hey.  I'm a little. 
[03:49:30]  But who cares?  What up, son?  Happy birthday, kid.  Eat that pussy.  What?  Hey, Sam.  I want that t-shirt for my birthday.  But first of all, I called to say what I learned today.  I learned that E-Rock likes Disturbed more than he likes Rob Zombie.  Yeah, E-Rock, why did you play Disturbed?  E-Rock is my boy.  E-Rock, but E-Rock, like right before Rob Zombie was coming in, like at the beginning of that segment,  E-Rock put on a Disturbed song.  I love E-Rock now.  Why?  I'm getting him some pussy today.  Why?  Why you? 
[03:50:00]  Because he fucking went against the grain.  That's my man.  Why did you play Disturbed, E-Rock?  There have been times we've had people in and if I played their music,  then they sit there and go, oh, he's playing their song.  Is it coming in now?  It's all uncomfortable.  Yeah, but you don't play something similar.  Like you either go completely different or you play the shit.  You don't play like something of the same genre.  Why not?  Because it doesn't make any sense.  It's like everybody picks up on the fact that, okay, this reminds me of Rob Zombie,  but it isn't Rob Zombie.  Nah, I think you're overthinking the rejoinder music. 
[03:50:30]  Dude, every single person in this room was like, what the fuck is he doing in there?  Because you brought it up.  No, I didn't bring it up.  I saw your face just going around trying to get other people's attention.  With your eyebrows up, like, what is he doing?  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  The minute everybody put their headphones on, they were all asking the same question.  What the fuck is he doing in there?  Why would you play Disturbed?  Roland, does it make any sense to you?  What did you say, Bob?  I said, can I get something for my birthday?  Yeah, I'll send you a mixtape.  All right, that works.  All right, I'll put you on hold. 
[03:51:00]  I do remember Terrell Owens when he came here.  Oh, that was my favorite with the football?  Yeah, Eric didn't put a name tag on one of the footballs.  And T.O. goes, I'll sign anything, but you have to do whoever.  Because he doesn't want an eBay.  eBay, okay.  So Eric, either he didn't put it in or it fell off.  And then T.O. goes, who's this for?  I go, I don't know.  He goes, well, now it's to Nicole.  Ah, that's fucked up.  He goes, someone's pitching if you put one, they're a bitch.  So Eric, do you have a football from T.O. that says to Nicole? 
[03:51:30]  I think so.  Oh, yeah.  It might be somewhere.  It's in his autograph collection?  There was supposed to be a name tag on it, but.  Yeah, because he does.  Great.  So great.  Rick in the Bronx.  Hey, prime time.  What's up, buddy?  What up, kid?  I sold a used washer and dryer to a New York news celebrity, Stormfield.  Stormfield is the weather guy.  Yeah.  And he shorted me 50 bucks. 
[03:52:00]  He brought a bunch of coffee mugs.  What a loser.  And shorted me 50 bucks.  And then I emailed him and he said, oh, it's a big misunderstanding.  We should have counted it together.  What?  He sent me a check for 25 bucks.  He just wouldn't let it slide.  He needed to know that he won.  He's still got a little deal on you.  I'd like to see what he pulls in restaurants and everything else.  You know, he tries to pull that card.  He's just leaving 8x10s instead of tips?  Wow.  And, Sam, you've got to drive a little faster on the West Side Highway, man. 
[03:52:30]  I whizz past you sometimes.  You're doing about 40, kid.  Dude, I've gotten way too many tickets on the West Side Highway.  Do you understand?  I'm going to end up like DJ Who, kid.  I literally have to set it on the speed.  Well, first of all, I don't need you stalking me on any West Side Highway.  I don't know why you know what I'm doing on the West Side Highway.  You can spot your hair from a mile away.  How many tickets do you have right now?  I got a lot.  And they're all pending.  And, like, I don't need to get a suspended license right now.  I'm the only guy who, kid, I don't drink.  Serious?  The only people...  I'm about to get my license suspended.  Because I got... 
[03:53:00]  So what?  I don't have one.  It's been, like, what, 12 years?  I understand that, but I'm not doing a night in jail.  Okay?  I'm not doing that.  I don't have DJ cred.  Get your ass fingered for a change, man.  I don't have 50 cents lawyer to call to get me out of my bullshit like you do.  Get me out of here.  Did you fix your driver's license situation?  It's a coincidence that this came up.  I'm going to court Thursday to finalize everything, pay all my bills.  How much are you going to have to pay?  My fee, whatever.  I got, like, $2,000 or something.  It's like $2,000, and I got a civil penalty for, like, $750, which may be reduced because 
[03:53:30]  I have a 50s lawyer.  That shit low.  Yeah, dude.  I can't.  I set...  I get my speedometer to the speed limit on the West Side Highway and then cruise control.  Get the fuck out of here.  Because I just...  You are such a fucking uterus.  Because I start speeding and I get tickets every time.  They just love pulling me over.  They think I'm black.  I don't know what it is.  It's that hair, yo.  You got that nigga hair.  Is that what it is?  Look at that shit, man. 
[03:54:00]  Do I need to inform them that it's just the hair and not actually an N-word?  Wear a t-shirt saying I'm not a nigga.  Yeah, but you...  What, can I get one from you?  I mean, that's what you rock all the time.  I'll get a hat made for you.  I'll get a fit.  Bobby.  Bobby.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, uh, when you met Rob Zombie, that was at the Virgin Megastore?  Yeah.  In San Jerome?  Yeah.  I was at the same thing.  He was awesome there, man.  But I met Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue there.  He was the most pretentious piece of shit I've ever had in my life.  Really?  At an autograph signing? 
[03:54:30]  Damn.  If you didn't have tickets, you didn't care.  He didn't really talk to you.  Oh, what a son of a bitch.  I actually met him before.  He's kind of cool.  You said he was a piece of shit.  Like...  He was a piece of fucking garbage, man.  How did you pick that up just from a signing?  Like, you could definitely tell when someone's cool.  It's the aura.  At the autograph signing with Rob Zombie, he was there with his whole band.  And it was actually when I was working for Scorch.  That's how long ago it was.  But he was there with his whole band.  And you're right.  He couldn't have been cooler at that signing.  His band couldn't have been cooler.  What was it? 
[03:55:00]  What did Nikki Sixx do that pissed you off to this extent?  Well, the thing I dug about Rob Zombie's signing was when he...  I don't know if you remember, but when he walked in and they had a table on a stage set up?  Yeah.  And he said, get this out of your hands.  I don't want to work down on my hands.  I don't want to work out of heart with him.  Which was great because I took a photo with him.  I got my shit signed.  You know, not my shit.  My arm.  You know, not my shit.  I got a photo with him showing me at the moment.  It was beautiful.  But Nikki Sixx, there was probably 2,000 or 3,000 people waiting to meet this guy. 
[03:55:30]  Wow.  And you just, you know, again, if you didn't have tits, he didn't want to talk to you.  I'm going to fuck you, asshole.  You know, everyone's saying the same thing.  Oh, Nick, I'm a huge fan.  I'm a huge fan.  I'm trying to say something that maybe I can engage in the conversation.  So I'm like, I'm a bass player, too.  I play the same bass as you.  Yeah.  And he didn't even make eye contact with me.  He wouldn't sign any of my memorabilia.  He wouldn't take a picture.  He just looked at the book, signed it.  He goes, so what's going on?  I'm like, apparently nothing.  And I just walked away. 
[03:56:00]  Wow.  That's the beauty of rock stars, though.  You know at some point he's going to be hard up and he's going to wonder why nobody likes him.  This is like a repetition as well.  Rock stars don't respect other musicians.  I guess they don't like the fans.  I don't know.  Unless they got tits.  Unless they got tits.  I met Angus Young from ACDC at the same place.  And I told him, I said, you know, you're the reason I'm playing guitar.  And he was cool?  And he was awesome.  He high-fived me.  I mean, a high-five, you know, Jim Norton goes, that's the way to go, man.  But it was great, man.  It's awesome.  You know, you've got to learn to appreciate stuff like that. 
[03:56:30]  But Nikki Sixx, fuck him and fuck his family.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  Fuck his family.  It might be like a comic, though.  They're telling the comic.  I know a good joke.  Let me tell you.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a bad day.  They're like, enough.  Enough of your dumb shit.  I guess.  I just couldn't picture somebody coming up to you and being like, I like what you do.  I'm actually just paying money for your art.  Can I take a photo with you?  Can I have an autograph?  And not being like, yeah, for sure.  You've got to be a little humble out there.  Right.  Like, when somebody comes up to me and they go, hey, Sam, I'm a big fan. 
[03:57:00]  Can I take a picture with you?  Like, in my head, I'm going, what the fuck is going on?  This is great.  So I'm not going to sit there and be like, yeah, dude.  I'm going to be like, holy shit.  This doesn't happen to people.  That's why I always take photos with bitches that suck my dick.  I mean, I respect them.  No, that's what he was talking about with Nikki Sixx.  You're the guy who's not paying attention unless they're selling your dick.  I'm not letting no dupes suck my dick.  They're already on the dick.  What's up, Alan Thicke Jr.? 
[03:57:30]  Do you think he might have been jaded by all the money he lost from, like, online piracy and music and stuff?  Listen, if you lose a whole bunch of money, you should be even more thankful that there are fans in a record store buying your CD and asking you to sign it.  Well, the bootlegs are going on.  They weren't pirating.  You know what I mean?  They're the people who aren't pirating.  Unless you're going to be a fucking asshole, then I'll just go to Napster instead of dealing with this bullshit.  And I know Napster's not around anymore, but neither is the Virgin Megastore, so cut me some slack. 
[03:58:00]  Okay?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Damn.  I'm in the era.  You ever met anybody famous that you didn't like except for me?  I was kind of disappointed when I met Adam Carolla, but that's about it.  Why?  Oh, shit.  Well, I mean, like, you know, he's a big reason why I got into radio, like, why I'm really interested in it.  And when I met him, I was like, hey, like, you know, you're the reason why I got into radio.  And he was like, all right.  And they took a picture, and it was like, and I didn't even have time to, like, set up.  It was essentially a crotch out of me, like, right next to Adam Carolla's head.  Well, that's partly because you're an idiot, and partly because, yeah, he was being a dick. 
[03:58:30]  So who's your new radio role model?  You.  That's what I thought.  That's what I thought.  And he was on your dick.  Well, they all are.  In a cool way.  In a cool way.  Not in, like, some pussy shit, right?  It's like a nut sack.  Right.  Like, in a good way.  Like, that's hip-hop, right?  Yeah, that's the hip-hop shit.  I mean.  Diddy says it all the time.  Yeah, he's on my dick.  You on my dick, son.  And then it's cool.  It's just like, all right.  All right, cool, man.  I'm on Diddy's dick.  You know what else is cool?  Oh, here we go.  The shaving.  No, I don't know what I'm going to talk about. 
[03:59:00]  We're talking about Rob Zombie.  Oh, okay.  Fuck it.  You know what Rob Zombie doesn't do, though?  No, don't fuck.  No, not fucking.  He's the fucking man.  You know why?  You got a tattoo.  All right, I'm a respect man.  I got his tattoo.  I got his fucking autograph on my arm forever.  It's not on my ass.  I would never show you my ass.  You know what's cool about Rob Zombie?  His name's Rob Zombie.  But he doesn't sit around zombying out his face with day-old razors.  You know what I mean?  He keeps that face smooth.  Well, except when he's growing out that big scraggly beard. 
[03:59:30]  But when it comes time to shave it, he shaves it.  He's always got...  His wife's pussy?  I don't know about that, kid.  We're not talking...  He shaves his wife's pussy?  I just told you.  I don't know about that.  Just trying to make sure everybody hears it.  Bzz, bzz, bzz.  No, no bzz, bzz, bzz.  It doesn't have to vibrate.  Rob Zombie knows that.  He knows that you don't need a vibrating handle.  Shit.  You don't need a back scratcher.  You don't need 10 blades.  Seriously.  Alan Thicke Jr., have you noticed the price that you pay for new razor blades?  It's all my expenditure income. 
[04:00:00]  It's how much?  It's all my money.  It's day in pesos!  And you do this every month for the rest of your life.  This!  Get me out.  This is your Rob Zombie Dollar Shave Club moment, okay?  This is what it's all about.  You don't have to shell out 20 bucks month after month.  Dollar Shave Club is genius.  You send them a couple bucks every month.  A couple bucks, not 20.  Just a few bucks.  And they deliver amazing quality razor blades right to your door.  You save a fortune, and you always have fresh blades on hand.

We had a double bonus.  He loves it.  He loves it.  Let me go to Matt in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, what's up, Sam Roberts? 
[04:01:00]  What's the haps?  How are you doing?  All right.  What's up, who, kid?  What up, kid?  You know the only other person that's ever asked me, what's the haps?  I didn't have any...  Paul Heyman asked me, what's the haps?  He goes, let me ask you, what's the haps?  I'll be like, I have no fucking idea.  I ask people that question.  I don't know what it means.  That's the second time I asked you, and you said you didn't answer.  You just replied with another question.  Yeah, because I don't know what the haps is.  It doesn't mean anything.  I just say it.  You guys remember that show, uh, Home Improvement with Tim the Toolman?  What's that dude's name? 
[04:01:30]  What's the lead star?  Tim Allen.  He's a fucking asshole.  Oh, shit.  Seriously?  What'd you try to go...  Did you try to take his hot rod out of the garage?  He's the only one who drives the hot rod.  He was partial owner of a, uh, an open-wheeled race car.  And I was running security at a Penske racing facility.  He was fucking drunk, driving through.  Okay, I don't know if that's true for sure, but go ahead.  It could be a lie, but...  It absolutely is true. 
[04:02:00]  I mean, if you probably ask him, he doesn't remember because he's a hammer.  Well, it's a legend.  Yeah, I mean, it's what a caller says.  Woo!  A legend.  But he was a dick.  No, a total, total dickhead.  I couldn't tell him to slow down.  No.  And he gave me the finger.  He and his goddamn whatever luxury car he was driving.  Oh, Matt.  I don't think so, Matt.  I hope it's true.  I, for one, hope it's true because it's hilarious.  But I don't know for sure.  I mean, it's Matt. 
[04:02:30]  You know?  I don't know.  He's asking me what's the haps.  He's obviously a lunatic.  Let's go to Racist Francesa.  Racist.  What's up, Corey?  How's it going, Racist Francesa?  Hey.  I'm chilling.  I'm chilling.  Okay, what's good?  What up, my nigga?  What up, my nigga?  I like this.  We get Racist Francesa out of character.  That's hot.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got a quote.  Biggest dick celebrity and a coolest celebrity.  Biggest dick celebrity is Dan Harron.  You know who he is?  He's the bitch for the Angels.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, another fucking baseball player.  Sports star.  Dick.  Dick.  He's from Washington Heights, too. 
[04:03:00]  He's like, hey, what's up, Danny Harron from the Heights?  He's like, yeah, great.  He's like, all right, whatever.  But the coolest celebrity I met, though, recently at WrestleMania 29, Sam Roberts.  Who is that?  There you go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  How great was that interaction, huh?  Who's the coolest celebrity that I met, Sam?  Tell me.  Professional broadcaster, primetime Sam Roberts.  That's the only way to go.  Thank you, bro.  Come on, bro.  Hook it up.  All right, buddy.  I respect that.  I'm going to put you on hold and I'll give you definitely a mixtape.  Maybe give these guys t-shirts, too. 
[04:03:30]  We got t-shirts, right, Eric?  Yeah, we got.  Are they wanting the ones that we got yesterday, those Halloween ones, or the just regular show  shirts?  No, just give them regular show shirts.  Okay, we got those.  All right.  Stay on hold, racist Francesca.  Yo, Sam, there's a big, juicy banana here.  Can I taste it?  What the fuck are you talking about right now, who kid?  That's my banana.  I'm like, I can't have a banana in front of me, son.  You just said there's some big, juicy banana.  There is, though.  I guess it's a, yeah, there's a piece of, if you want it.  That's my banana.  Oh, that's your, I don't want it. 
[04:04:00]  That's my banana, who kid?  I don't want to taste your banana, man.  This is getting weird in here.  Really weird.  What's up, Jason in Detroit?  What up, kid?  Who kid?  What up, kid?  Hey, um, I used to, uh, put it through here.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Jason, if you could hang on a second.  Alan Thicke, Jr., the intern.  Oh, my God.  Jim left his banana here.  Yes.  When Jim leaves grapes, you go, could I have those grapes?  Yes.  When Jim leaves a banana, you go, could I have that banana?  You like to eat Jim's leftover fruit, correct?  Correct. 
[04:04:30]  Uh, who kid brought attention to it just now?  It was crazy.  What the audience didn't see was Roland requested the banana.  And while we were talking to Jason in Detroit, uh, intern Alan Thicke, Jr., what happened?  Um, Roland asked for the banana.  I handed it to him, and then Roland immediately destroyed the banana.  Why would you give it to him?  He took the, he took, he took the banana, he slammed it down on the table, he squished  it like a rolling pin, and then he chucked it in the garbage can. 
[04:05:00]  That had to be a disappointment for you, yes?  Yes.  Yes.  Why would you give it to Roland?  Hey, fuck yes.  Because I didn't think he was going to do that.  Well, no, you could have ended that sentence early.  Oh.  You didn't think, did you?  I didn't.  Not a lot of that goes on, huh?  I guess not.  It's all good, buddy.  Yeah, Roland, you're a bully, man.  It's all good.  A little bit of a bully.  Fickin' on the retarded kid, huh, Roland?  Yeah.  That's no offense to you, Alan.  Yeah, that's all right.  Jay, I know what you mean.  Timmy. 
[04:05:30]  Do they still do that character?  Come on.  Oh, God.  They do?  Timmy is still on South Park?  Still on South Park.  He just sits in the back.  He doesn't really say anything.  Yeah, he hasn't had an episode in a while.  Yeah, because I remember saying Timmy when I was in high school.  I love it.  Timmy.  I'm in front of retards, man.  I mean, handicaps.  Right, right.  What's up, Jason?  Hey, guys.  Years ago, I used to put in pool tables for a living, and I had to go to Allen Houston  South when he played for the Pistons, or he went to the Knicks.  And I knew the day before I was going up there, so I went out and bought myself a nice NBA 
[04:06:00]  regulation basketball company.  Cost me a few bucks.  Yeah.  I figured I'd go up there, and I put in this pool table, real beautiful house in the outskirts  of Detroit.  And, you know, sometimes you spend a couple bucks when you're going to meet these people.  Like, when Tarantino was in here, I was like, you know what?  I'm going to shell out $80, $90.  I'm going to get that Blu-ray box set so I can get the old QT on it.  Yeah, so, you know, I put in this pool table, go over everything with him, take out my, 
[04:06:30]  you know, have my assistant go get the basketball.  You know, he signed, you know, that we delivered the pool table.  I go, hey, I'm a big fan.  Can I get an autograph?  You know, if you could make it out to me.  He's like, nah, man, I can't do that for you.  No way.  After all that shit?  Why not?  You weren't in a public place.  I know.  And so, luckily, actually, like you said, it cost me a few bucks.  Luckily, I still had the receipt and took the ball back.  And after that, when the Pistons got rid of him, I was so happy. 
[04:07:00]  I never let that guy sit.  Yeah.  I'm glad he went to the Knicks.  I'm glad he never won a championship.  Fuck that ball.  These fucking athletes, they don't realize.  Straight navel lint, I'm telling you.  Navel lint?  Like that belly button shit?  He made him do all that and couldn't sign a ball?  What a loser.  These athletes don't understand.  Fuck him.  That this shit called life is cyclical, okay?  And I will meet you on the other end, and we'll see what happens, okay?  When this, whatever his name is in Detroit.  He's so evil, man.  That's evil.  That's true.  No, that's what happens.  That's some real shit. 
[04:07:30]  That's some karmatic shit who could recognize.  That's evil.  You know what?  If I had come on your show three or four years ago with that Rick Ross interview, and you  had played the interview, and you would have been like, that's a funny interview, now get  the fuck out of here, white boy, and thrown me off your show like that, guess what?  You would have been, yeah.  I never would have brought you into my universe, and we never would have been able to create  this great empire that we're in the process of creating.  I would have been a regular nigga.  Right, that's exactly what you would have been.  No, I'm that nigga. 
[04:08:00]  And I would have been like, you guys know who, kid?  And Opie would have been like, what, that regular nigga?  Exactly.  And I would have been like, Opie, don't use that word.  Who, kid?  Is not giving you permission, because in this alternate dimension, he decided to be a dickhead.  It all, what goes around comes around.  Of course.  Treat people the way you'd like to be treated, if I'm trying to tell you who, kid.  That's what my mother taught me.  And give me care, kid.  You know, Mother's Day is coming up, by the way.  This is why you've got to respect your moms.  I mean, you respect your moms by...  I just give her a G every time she sees me.  But, and you watched her, didn't you watch her, like, shave her pubic hairs or whatever? 
[04:08:30]  A long time ago.  Yeah, you did do that when you were younger.  But you give her $1,000 every time you see her.  I can't even remember that.  Of course, I remember everything.  I honestly would remember me watching a book.  I also, I remember you peeking on your mom in a Don Draper moment, if you saw Mad Men this week, peeking in on your mom while she washed her vagina.
