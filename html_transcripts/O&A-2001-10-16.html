<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of the fallout from their April Fool's Day prank announcing Boston Mayor Tom Menino's death.  This resulted in their indefinite suspension from WAAF,  Mayor Menino's threat of an FCC complaint and potential lawsuit, and a subsequent return to Boston radio where they boasted of achieving number one ratings in the men 18-49 demographic, surpassing their former station and rival DJ Rocco. The hosts spent considerable time mocking their former boss, Dave Douglas, and other WAAF colleagues,  interspersed with audio clips from rival Boston radio stations and discussions of upcoming appearances.  Opie's sports curse was also revisited, with a caller noting difficulty receiving WAAF in Boston. The entire segment was punctuated by copious vulgar and offensive language.

The broadcast then shifted to a humorous, poorly executed Yankees-themed song, apparently commissioned by Maeve Giuliani. This transitioned into a discussion about the perceived negativity surrounding New York City and its sports teams, juxtaposed with the resilience of New Yorkers, alongside mockery of various team songs.  Upcoming events were promoted, including a Philadelphia trip for a meet-and-greet, radio broadcast, and road show featuring Days of the New and Steven Lynch, alongside a "$1000 Stars and Stripes Bikini Contest."  Calls from listeners included Doug Ray ("Bad Ronald") of Bowery thanking the hosts for promotion, and a false report of Neil Diamond being in the studio.  A significant portion revolved around Opie's purported ability to guess a woman's age by observing her "taint,"  with caller corroboration and a live, apparently successful demonstration.  The anthrax scare affecting news organizations was discussed, featuring an unedited, highly offensive clip of Tom Brokaw's reaction.  The segment concluded with a surprise appearance by the entire band Jane's Addiction.  They discussed their return to performing, post-9/11 and anthrax scare sentiments regarding New York City,  Perry Farrell's past drug use and reasons for quitting, and his unusual theories about alien communication through music based on mineral compounds.

Jane's Addiction remained in studio for the next segment.  The conversation covered their tour, Perry Farrell's mineral-based alien communication theory, listener requests for discounted tickets (granted by the hosts),  the band's feelings about flying, their history and views on contemporary music, and numerous listener calls.  Funny moments included caller interactions, discussions of Perry Farrell's eccentricities,  and a Frank Caliendo impression bit (Aquaman and John Madden).  Promotional spots for O2Go water and Double D's gentlemen's club aired.  The Philadelphia show, meet-and-greet, and bikini contest were again promoted, along with a brief mention of an upcoming sales meeting.  The conversation heavily featured Perry Farrell's unusual ideas and the hosts' reactions.

The final segment focused on an upcoming field trip to WISP radio in Philadelphia.  The hosts speculated about the personalities and office layouts of WISP employees, particularly contrasting their own fun workspace with the allegedly austere office of their program director Ken (described as containing an "anal couch" and featuring binoculars).  Jeremy's meticulously organized office also provided a contrast.  Numerous listener calls featured "lessons learned" from the show—mostly jokes and non sequiturs—including comments about a celebrity's appearance,  a humorous take on good ratings, and speculation about an intern's possible anthrax connection.  An intern hospitalized with potential pneumonia, who had left suspicious items around the building, was also mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion of distributing Jane's Addiction concert tickets (possibly stolen from the boss's office) to listeners, highlighting logistical challenges, and expressing excitement for the Philadelphia trip.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I hope their listeners Mayor Menino had been killed in a car accident.  At the time it aired, the mayor's wife, Angela, thought her husband was in a car on the way to the airport, so she thought it was true.  When the mayor's staff heard about the prank, they demanded a retractation.  Totally irresponsible.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  Boston Mayor Tom Menino, thankfully, is alive and well, contrary to a radio station's so-called April Fool's joke.  W.A.A.F. DJs O.B. and Anthony had announced on the air the mayor was killed in a car accident in Florida. 
[00:00:30]  Tom Menino is very much alive and not at all amused.  It was an April Fool's joke, albeit a tasteless one.  But, you know, some of the listeners actually found it very funny, and I do want to state that,  because we're getting a lot of flack that it was just shocking.  There was some comedic value to it.  Now, the mayor plans to file a complaint to the FCC, and he may even sue the radio station.  And W.A.A.F. management says they've offered to let the mayor throw pies in the DJ's faces to raise money for charity. 
[00:01:00]  But tonight, Opie and Anthony told me they will not go along with that.  This is where it gets stupid.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line, huh?  Uh, yeah.  I just wish, I just, I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  Tom Menino was very upset.  Adding to his anger was the fact that the on-air personalities never apologize. 
[00:01:30]  We apologize to the mayor.  Never apologize.  I am sorry, mayor.  I will not accept the apology of this time.  I am sorry, mayor.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  This is going to get you fired.  I am sorry, mayor.  You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.  The station initially tried to parlay this incident into a publicity stunt.  Station owners did take the situation very seriously, and today, they acted.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly announced that Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash. 
[00:02:00]  Now, WAAF has suspended the DJs indefinitely without pay.  Mayor Menino is also seeking sanctions from the Federal Communications Commission.  Let's kick it!  Today, Opie and Anthony were gone.  Fired.  Fired.  Opie and Anthony are unemployed tonight.  Opie and Anthony have been terminated.  Fired.  And that looks like the last you're going to hear from either of these DJs for a while.  And if the former WAAF afternoon drive duo are looking for sympathy, they better not look on the streets of Boston. 
[00:02:30]  I agree with that.  I think they should have been fired.  Absolutely.  I think they should have been fired.  It's like someone saying that's my mama's head.  Opie and Anthony are off the air for good.  Losers.  Opie and Anthony have been fired.  It was all just a joke.  Opie and Anthony delivered the joke on April Fool's Day.  But the punchline knocked them right out of Boston radio.  They're dead air as far as their radio show is concerned.  That's no joke.  The station's keeping kind of a low profile as a couple of its top DJs go to no profile. 
[00:03:00]  Instead of delivering jokes, Opie and Anthony are going to be delivering audition tapes.  Mayor Menino had no comment on that tonight.  But in a statement, he said,  Hopefully this incident will give all broadcasters pause.  Pause.  Pause.  Or they make statements which are false and irresponsible.  Pissed off.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  We killed the mayor of Boston.  Don't ask them.  Opie and Anthony.  But we're a nobody's bitch.  Can anyone take a joke anymore? 
[00:03:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today.  Ah.  A couple phone numbers really fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Boston!  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  We're throwing my voice out today.  866-277-4.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  The rest of the country is going to have to bear with us for at least two and a half hours today.  Now, we'll try to make this quick and painless.  Well, it's going to be painful for someone and painless for everyone else.  I guess thank yous must go out from this program to the fine folks.  Let's just put it this way, Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  Anthony and I are on the radio to be number one, men 18 of 49.  Yeah.  Ah, the papers will talk about overall numbers and women and this and that.  But we get paychecks for being number one, men 18 of 49.  That's it.  Basically, number one in the male demos.  Well, that's what this show is pretty much about.  Hey, ladies, we love you.  Trust me, and we're glad you're listening.  But as far as advertisers and station management goes, they want us to bring in the lucrative men numbers. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  We are number one in all the male demos in New York City, including men 18 of 49.  Right.  We found out yesterday that we're number one in all the male demos in Philly.  Yes.  Including 18 of 49.  Well, we've got to add another city to that list today.  Yes.  The fine city of Boston.  Of Boston, Massachusetts.  We are now number one, men 18 of 49.  Wow.  In Boston. 
[00:05:30]  What happened?  We've only been on the air like two months.  Good idea, Dave.  Telling me not to talk about him.  Dave.  Oh, my God.  He must have been throwing things in the office today.  This win is so sweet because we were kicked out of Boston on the top of our game.  Yeah.  Our bosses at the time, one still works there. 
[00:06:00]  Dave Dickless.  Dave Douglas.  Hello.  Didn't support us.  Dave.  We've told the stories many times, I know.  Yeah.  And I know a bunch of people rolling their eyes, but you've got to bear with us today.  Yeah.  A guy that was more worried about saving his own neck basically called us and told us  to lie about this mayor prank that we did to save his own ass.  Would you say that I didn't hear about this until, oh, six o'clock or so?  Sent us to the firing squad, and we were fired, and we were picked up here in New York. 
[00:06:30]  We work with people that understand what Ant and I do.  Yeah.  They understand we're going to get in trouble.  They understand we take it to the limit.  And I'll tell you this one thing.  And we've done things down here in New York that are ten times worse than saying the mayor  of Boston died in a car accident.  Hell yeah.  The difference, we had a company and bosses.  Yeah.  Two guys that we do make fun of, but we've got to give them their props today.  Ken Stevens and Jeremy Coleman.  Mm-hmm.  That support us.  When we do get in trouble, they take that walk down that road. 
[00:07:00]  The green mile.  Take the walk down 56th Street.  Yeah.  To the big office.  And they sit there with us.  And they're willing to lose their jobs.  Well.  Alongside.  Slow down.  Ken was.  Ken was on many occasions.  He was right there with us.  Yeah.  Getting yelled at.  He didn't, like, you know, beg us on the side to, you know, lie.  Change your story.  To save his own ass.  Okay, Dave.  He understands this type of radio, and he's there for us. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Simple as that.  So we get fired, and three and a half years later, we're now back on in Boston.  Yeah.  And the ratings came in today.  Ah, yes.  And payback, my friends, is a bitch.  Unless you're on this side of it.  Then it's really nice.  We told our old radio station in Boston, WAF, that we were going to kill them in the ratings.  Mm-hmm.  We begged them to at least go out fighting.  Yeah.  But, you know, a bunch of pussies over there, they do what Dave Douglas says, and Dave told  them to shut their mouths. 
[00:08:00]  What was I supposed to do?  He rules with an iron fist.  And now, because you shut your mouth, and you allowed us to just walk all over you, you  are definitely crying today.  What's the matter, Rock Hole?  What's the matter, schlocko?  You should have said something.  Stop doing your fake bits, and confront us.  Do something.  No, he doesn't even have to confront, because you know what?  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  We've got to move on to bigger and better things now. 
[00:08:30]  We gave you a chance, and now it's over.  That wasn't even a fun battle.  Well, it was kind of fun, but it wasn't even an interesting one.  You kept your mouth shut, and you continued doing your fake radio bits, and we exposed  you for the fraud you are.  The station was living off what we did when we were up there.  Mm-hmm.  Running around, having parties, and drinking, and patting each other on the back, while  Ant and I were wondering where we were going to work next.  All the people that made that radio station are long gone. 
[00:09:00]  I think we all could agree with that.  We're gone.  Ozone's gone.  Well, yeah.  Bruce Mittman's gone.  Come on.  They call him the architect.  The architect.  He's good.  Boys.  He moved on from AF, and he's now building a slum called WFNX.  I certainly have my work cut out for me, boys.  Boys.  B-b-b-boys.  Yeah.  We love Brucey.  I've got to tell you.  I know this is a little too inside, but the GM that made AF, not that twat that's in there 
[00:09:30]  now.  She has no clue what she's doing.  Bruce gets fired, too, and Dave doesn't stick up for him as well.  So, he goes over to FNX, and he's going to build, like, the new AF.  Yeah.  And then we came to town, and...  Ouch.  Kind of threw a wrench into those works.  Sorry.  It's kind of weird, because I'm looking at the ratings in Boston, and I don't even see  FNX on the list.  Ouch.  I mean, we printed up the first three pages.  You'd think they'd be here somewhere.  I have a grand scheme, boys. 
[00:10:00]  It's quite all right.  Anything's grand compared to me.  I'm very diminutive, boys.  Dave, what do I do?  I know I should have said something.  All right, Matty, here's what we do.  I say that you're having an argument with your wife, and you got to live at my house.  Oh, you know what?  We did that, Schlocko.  Oh, I get confused with the old fake bits that we've been doing. 
[00:10:30]  We'll give him credit.  But I think Rocco beat us in one demo, Anthony.  He did?  Yeah.  Boys 12 to 17.  Was it the boys, the young boys?  Oh, dear.  Yes, my favorite demo.  Woo!  Yes.  That's a demo I could sink my teeth into.  Yes, yes.  Dear boys.  So really fast, and then we can move on.  We told you guys. 
[00:11:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Birdsy, it's Rocco.  What's up?  Look, I'm thinking maybe we should hook back up.  Birdsy, for the rest of the country, was Rocco's partner after we got booted.  Yeah, here it was.  Rocco and Birdsy got put together by Dave Dickless, I guess.  And, you know, we weren't in town, so they eked out a little existence there.  It was kind of cute to watch.  And then, for some reason, Dave Dickless decides he's going to fire Birdsy. 
[00:11:30]  Because Birdsy wanted more money or something.  Because Birdsy wanted some cash or something or whatever.  You know, it's his right.  So he tells him, no, you're fired.  Here's Rocco's on-air partner, which could, I mean, I couldn't imagine Jeremy Coleman coming  up to one of us and going that, hey, Opie or Anthony, your partner there, I'm firing him.  And you're just going, okay.  Or me just going, yeah, I'm fine, okay.  I'll continue to do the show, Dave. 
[00:12:00]  And he did.  He didn't stick up for his on-air partner and just let him be fired.  The whole station, they just, they don't want to take care of each other.  Nope, that's what it's all about.  We got fired.  No one stood up for us, okay.  Bruce Mittman gets fired.  Dave doesn't, you know, stick up for him.  Bruce hired Dave and then took him out of the middle of nowhere, a place he's going back  to real soon.  Oh, yeah.  Dave, look around, Dave.  Look around.  Take a good look.  You are going to be out of Boston radio so quick. 
[00:12:30]  It'll make your head spin.  And then Birdsy gets fired and no one, you know, Rocco doesn't stick up for him.  So they have a history of this over there.  You think that bitch boss you got to answer to is going to let you stick around when you  destroy the station?  The station that pretty much, I'll say, John Ostelin built musically.  He's the only guy that had a clue as to what was going on musically at that station, the  Ozone.  And he bailed out for a better gig. 
[00:13:00]  You know?  That's a springboard station, my friend.  And the only people that are still in the pool years later are the people that couldn't  climb out.  Anyone with any type of motivation for their career, you know, moved on.  You move on.  So now the station's left with a bunch of pussies.  Dave, I can't wait.  That knew we were coming to town and we're too scared to fight.  Yeah.  Hey, I'll just go about my business.  Do my great Bin Laden parodies.  Oh, Jesus.  We didn't get where we were today listening to the likes of Dave Douglas. 
[00:13:30]  Anyway, and really fast.  Oh, what?  Anyway, real fast.  The ratings for Boston.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Afternoon drive.  Schlocko with a 3.1 share.  Ah, that's kind of cute.  That's cute.  We have a 4.1.  Oh.  By the way, we're only a half of this ratings book.  Yeah.  Nick Carter helped out.  So Nick kicked your ass to Schlocko. 
[00:14:00]  Schlocko.  That'll hurt.  Men, 18 to 49.  That's what we are paid to do.  That's it.  Rocco.  Ooh, 6.5.  Hey, that's not bad.  Hey, not bad.  That's cute.  Opie and Anthony on WBCN.  Ooh, that would be an 8.9 for first place.  Oh.  Oops.  Ow, Rocco.  Ow.  Oops.  Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  the fluke.  Is 8.9 a lot more than 6.5? 
[00:14:30]  Uh, yeah.  That's a lot more people.  Uh, Jim, I, I, you know, thank God my sports curse has nothing to do with radio.  I will guarantee that number is going to be a lot higher.  Yep.  And if I was a betting man, I wouldn't bet against me here.  No, because, uh, how bad he is at sports curse, that's how good he is at figuring this crap out.  I'm the rain man of radio.  Believe me.  Persons 18 to 34.  Ah, Rocco, nice showing.  6.6. 
[00:15:00]  Not as good as, uh, Opie and Anthony's 9.1 on WBCN.  Persons 25 to 54.  Ooh, that's a big money demo, Anthony.  The advertisers love the 25 to 54 person demo.  Yeah.  Oh, Rocco has a nice 2.8 for 14th place.  Not bad.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Hey, you'll get a lot of beer companies calling you soon.  We got a 4.4, Ant.  Men, 25 to 54.  You break down a little more there.  Uh, Rocco, 4.1.  Opie and Anthony on WBCN, 7.0. 
[00:15:30]  Ah.  This is a cute little demo called, uh, Men 18 to 34.  This is the bread and butter of, uh, of, uh, our old radio station.  That's what they say, you know.  1834, Men, here's the, uh, the, the core audience.  Here it is.  Uh, FNX.  We'll, we'll go down to FNX on this one, okay?  Uh, thank you for recognizing our station boy.  Storm and, uh, what?  We'll give him a plug.  Birdsey.  Storm and Birdsey.  Uh, they got a 2.3 share.  Ah, right.  That's good for 11th place. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Schlocko, 9.9 for 3rd.  Look at that.  9.9 is in 3rd place.  He used to be in first, Dan, before we came to town with an 11.1.  An 11.1?  Wow.  One could only dream of getting an 11.1.  Well, we have a 13.6.  Oh, my goodness.  And that is good enough for first place.  Schlocko.  Oh.  We told you.  At least you could have went out fighting.  But now you lost all your ratings and you're a pussy. 
[00:16:30]  Maybe it's some of the, um, I don't know.  Maybe it's some of the bits he was done.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  You want to listen to a little song?  You want to listen to some fun, uh, uh, schlocko Matty stuff?  Yeah, this is what, uh...  Yeah, this is good stuff.  Come on.  I'm in Taliban. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, Schlocko and Matty, live on your airwaves.  You should join, too.  It's a great organization.  Unless you're a woman.  Or a gang.  Or have any independence up whatsoever.  Other than that, you're welcome.  Join us.  Have I lost my mind?  I join the Taliban cause I'm swine.  Long heels and long shawls.  I think turbans are the balls.  Evil I will spread. 
[00:17:30]  I think women should cover their head.  Okay, look.  Wow.  Hey, congrats, guys.  You're now syndicated.  We just syndicated one of your bits.  Look, that's...  Yeah, there you go.  That was heard in many cities.  That was Iron Man.  Why would anybody...  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass.  I see a cute little Mass Pike song.  Oh, that one.  That's good.  And then, uh...  Let's see what that one's all about.  All right.  The, um... 
[00:18:00]  This is, uh, Schlocko and Matty.  It's, uh, F the Mass Pike.  Ooh, nice.  This is great stuff.  Cursing out a row, that's always good.  Hey, F the Mass Pike is robbing me blind.  You see jerks stuff that screw us and they take every dime.  I can't stand the door like what a mean, nasty trick.  Come on, F the Mass Pike. 
[00:18:30]  I got my hatch pipe.  Let's all wait for it.  Me and my family.  You won't be shitting me.  You and your increase.  I'm gonna drive by.  That's good stuff.  Oh, you're a friggin' whole guy.  Oh, f the Mass Pike.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  Come on.  Hey, I'll give you credit.  They did a local bit. 
[00:19:00]  Local bits always help you read the joke.  Hey, that's great stuff.  Keep it a local.  And then, um, of course, um, we got, uh, Taliban Girls Go Wild.  Ooh.  Schlocko appearing.  Now you can have the hottest action right here in your living room.  All the sexiest movies in the new, too hot for TV video, Taliban Girls Gone Wild.  Let's see what happens when we point our cameras and these Taliban chicks tear it off. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, is that...  That's great stuff.  That's Rocco's actual voice.  That's Rocco.  Hey, Rocco, you're syndicated.  There you go.  Hope you enjoyed that five seconds.  What a dick.  Taliban Girls Go Wild, Dave.  This is going to make me number one.  Did you run that bit past Dave before you recorded it to make sure it was okay?  Yeah, that sounds good.  I'll help you write it.  I'm the third member of the Schlocko and Maddie show. 
[00:20:00]  Well, that's it.  It was very, uh, very fun.  It was very decisive.  Kicking your fat ass.  It's kind of like the military, uh, actions in Afghanistan.  And, yeah, there's nothing really going on from the other side.  Lobbing some bombs over.  Just wait till we bring in the heavy artillery.  We've just begun.  There you go.  There you go.  Gave you a little sample of the talent pool over there.  That's great. 
[00:20:30]  And then they wonder why they're just going to dwindle away in the ratings until, uh, their asses are out of the seats.  And, uh, Dave Dickless has to trot along to some other small market somewhere.  I'm sorry to say that we can't really spend much time on our old station in Boston anymore.  I mean, we'll swatch every once in a while just to make it all fun.  But we already kicked your ass.  But we got to move on to bigger and better things.  We need to find a real fight.  Yeah.  I thought that was going to be the one.  You know?  What do you want to go on?  Battled.  Who do we have to, uh, compete against next here? 
[00:21:00]  Howie?  Want to take on Howie Carr now?  Is that even an issue?  Not really.  I mean, I...  Let me see.  Kind of doing like a...  Let me see.  ...political thing.  I...  We could just make fun of ourselves.  No.  That's good.  At least we'll fight back.  Eh, there's no one ahead of us, really.  So if you want, you're in Boston.  I wish, uh, wish Rocco some condolences on the death of his ratings. 
[00:21:30]  On the loss of his ratings.  Rocco, how embarrassing is it that we're not going to, like, fight you anymore and we've  got to fight Dale Dorman?  Oh.  Oh, that's killer, man.  I'm kind of bummed they didn't fight back.  We love a good fight.  Now if they try fighting, it's just going to sound silly.  Because everyone knows they shut their mouths as soon as Dave Douglas and that twat told them  to.  Yeah.  That freaking woman GM that they got. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, my God.  The twat that calls our lawyers every time we mention her on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's her name?  I can't even remember.  I don't know.  We're not allowed to say it anymore.  Yeah.  So that's why we call her...  I mean her first name.  Julie.  Julie Twat.  Julie Twat.  And then you've got to answer to her.  How does that feel, Dave?  How does that feel that you've got to now go to her and explain why Rocco's ratings are  so far down and why ONA are kicking his ass?  Dave, you've got to crawl in there, suck it up, and answer to this bitch why Rocco is 
[00:22:30]  getting beaten by us.  And you have no answer, do you, Dave?  Well, we're hoping to things pick up.  Well, we'll call Sully from Godsmack.  He'll give us a big bump.  That'll do it.  That'll do it.  We'll do another free show at Godsmack, and that should get the whole city of buzz.  I think more crossovers between the shows.  We should probably do that.  I think we could do another local palooza and rape the local bands blind.  That's good.  When we pocket money off the hardworking local bands, that'll help. 
[00:23:00]  Sure.  We'll get Rocco out there.  Oh, that's right.  Rocco can't make appearances because ONA's listeners destroy him.  All of a sudden, you go to the website and try to find out where Rocco's appearing.  Nowhere.  Psycho Tim, what's up?  Gentlemen, how's it going?  All right, bro.  Congratulations, of course.  Well, we want to thank our old listeners in Boston that obviously didn't forget about us.  We were a little worried.  Well, my question is, what am I supposed to do now?  Well, you're going to have to go after Dale Dorman. 
[00:23:30]  Dale Dorman.  I don't even know who he is.  I swear to God.  And we were in the same city broadcasting for three and a half years.  As long as you just leave my Lon and Wally alone.  I love Lon and Wally.  When I am trying to navigate the streets of Boston by not making a left-hand chin, I only listen to Lon and Wally.  Box of Wally.  I mean, I really didn't even attack him that hard.  I know.  It was kind of cute.  It's kind of like Michael Jordan coming back into the NBA and then he finds out it's now wheelchair basketball. 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  I bought one of those megaphones for a hundred bucks.  I thought I was going to get at least one use out of it.  It's all, you know, Rocco has no balls and it's so obvious.  He sat there.  He listened to Dave, which was rule number one in the Opie and Anthony playbook.  You don't listen to Dave.  Dave's a dick.  He's a no-talent, no-knowledge putz from the Midwest that rode the coattails of anyone that had talent and made headway at that station. 
[00:24:30]  Period.  The guy is a loser.  He sat back while John Ostelin programmed that station and did a damn good job building relationships with record companies.  He leaves.  Dave's lost in space.  We're not there, so he figures a schlocko and whoever is sitting next to him is going to do just as well as O&A did there.  Sorry.  That ain't the way it works, Dave Dickless. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And then do some comparisons of some live events.  BCN, River Rave.  The likes of STP, Aerosmith.  Black Rose Live.  Black Rose.  I mean, bands that, you know, you listen to on a daily basis.  The Loco Bazooka.  The Loco Bazooka.  Unknown bands that are being extorted so they can get on stage and play.  They have to pay to play. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  All right, Tim.  All right, guys.  I'm on the way down to New York right now.  I thought maybe I'd join you in Philadelphia tomorrow.  Oh, cool.  Is there anybody in Philadelphia that can attack tomorrow?  No.  I can't even think of one person in Philly there.  MMR.  They didn't give us a fight in Philly.  That was kind of embarrassing.  Like come down and consult or something like that?  You know when MMR found out in Philly that Ed and I were coming to town, they started applauding and cheering.  And they thought it was the end of WISP.  They threw a little party for themselves. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, it's cute.  Gay.  They probably put on cute little birthday hats, little party hats.  Gay.  Remember when Dave Dickless took out a little ad in one of the trade papers that said, congratulations, BCM, on your new format?  Like all of a sudden they were going to be a talk station?  Unbelievable.  No, we're just a rock talk show.  That's right.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  All right.  See you in a while.  That didn't work very well, did it?  Dave.  Dave. 
[00:26:30]  And we're pretty damn local as far as Boston goes.  We got like three or four appearances in the next month alone.  Have some fun up there, man.  Dave.  What do I do?  Nothing.  Just watch it happen.  We told you what to do.  Hey, Dave.  How about not letting your wife program the station?  How about not letting your wife tell you what offends her personally and then you going to the show and saying don't do that?  Oh, man.  I didn't think we were going there today.  No, we're going there.  We're going there.  Wow.  Yeah, we found out through certain people that he had a problem with some of the bits we were doing. 
[00:27:00]  And then we find out he might have been influenced in his personal life.  So he would come to our show and just go, yeah, I don't like the way you're talking about the gays or this, that, or the other thing.  And tell us not to do things.  And what did we do?  We did whatever the hell we wanted.  That's the only way you win when you are saddled with an albatross like Dave Dickless, rock hole. 
[00:27:30]  If you had balls, you would understand.  You don't listen to Dave.  Get on the air.  If you're pissed at O&A, you yell at O&A.  If it takes longer than the allotted friggin' minute and a half that Dave allows you to talk, then you blow off some songs.  Have some balls.  But no, it didn't pan out that way.  It's not going to happen that way.  And it showed up in the numbers, didn't it? 
[00:28:00]  Rock hole in Dave.  Well, thank you, Boston.  Boston, bless you.  Thank you.  So, I had all the confidence that the listeners would be there like they were when we were originally there.  And they were.  There's a couple things, you know, if you're a faithful listener to the show, we would like you to do.  First of all, call up Nick Carter on BCN.  Because this is half his book, my friends.  We did this together.  And congratulate him. 
[00:28:30]  Because he took a lot of crap from rock hole.  And he's doing well in his midday slot.  And make sure you call our old radio station and congratulate Rocco on his fine ratings.  Condolences.  I'm so sorry on the loss of your ratings.  Send him those prayer cards.  Yeah.  Go to like one of the drugstores or something.  And they have that section that says sympathy or sympathies. 
[00:29:00]  And fill out a sympathy card and send it to Rocco for the loss of his ratings and his balls.  On the heels of the loss of your balls, it is so sorry to hear of the loss of your ratings.  I love it.  Yes.  I'm loving this today.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  You guys rock.  Hey, thanks. 
[00:29:30]  Calling out of Boston.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Main reason AAF sucks completely in the city of Boston is that I live in Boston.  Yeah.  And I can't get AAF on my radio even if I wanted to.  No.  No.  It's complete static.  On top of like, you know, Rocco's voice.  It's like all you hear is.  It's ridiculously retarded.  Well.  Retarded.  I love it.  I love the retarded.  Well, you know, as long as you can receive it crystal clear in Bridgeport, Connecticut, 
[00:30:00]  I guess that's all they really care about.  That's basically all they count.  Because they talk about how Boston they are.  And for the love of God, you can't even get the goddamn station in Boston.  They're completely horrible.  And I mean, the only good DJ they actually had, I don't want to name any names, but like  the 7 to 11 DJ they had, they decided to change that and put it to the midday to try  and like compete.  We told Dave how stupid that was.  If he wants, I mean, he can start calling me.  I'll consult that station.  I can fix that station tomorrow.  Definitely.  And the new nighttime guy, he's just, he's a tool. 
[00:30:30]  He's a puppet.  I am a programmer now, you know.  Oh, yeah.  The new night guy is ridiculous.  He's a mannequin.  All right.  We said that was a stupid move.  Yeah, you shouldn't have put her in middays.  Because she was a good DJ.  All right.  And she still is, but I mean, nothing compared to you guys.  All right, Joe.  It's nice to have you guys coming up here for Halloween, though.  Yeah, we're going to have a ball with that.  We're going to start talking about that later this week, all right?  All right, man.  Peace, Joe.  You guys rock.  Thank you. 
[00:31:00]  I wonder if Dave Dickless goes over to Ozone, over at RKO, and just asks him,  Hey, how do I get in touch with these labels, these record labels?  How do I get this band over here?  Got any numbers?  Well, yes.  Any phone numbers?  Some phone numbers you want to pass to me?  So there you have it.  It's been a long three and a half years, but we came back and we did it.  Yeah.  I know we're crowing today.  Trust me.  And this is not our style, usually.  New York will know that.  Yeah.  We usually spend about two minutes on ratings in New York. 
[00:31:30]  It's just this victory.  But this has been something that has been just eating away at us for a very long time.  Just watch Gladiator.  You see how he got screwed over?  And then he came back and kicked some ass?  That's how we're feeling.  That's how we were wronged.  We were wronged.  And we knew we were wronged.  It's just nice to march back and kick some ass.  Even if, you know, you're not getting any fight back. 
[00:32:00]  Friggin' pathetic.  All right, we got to move on, Ant.  Yes, we do.  Thank you, Boston.  Might I offer a hearty congratulations to the boys?  Congratulations!  Thank you.  Thank you.  I want a congratulations from b-b-boys.  Where's Bruce?  Get Bruce on the phone.  We want him to congratulate us.  B-b-boys.  How bad would that be for Bruce?  Boys, can you not kick my ass so much  so maybe my radio station could appear 
[00:32:30]  on the first page of the ratings?  Boys, boys.  I'm in 21st place as a station  and it only goes up to the top 20, boys.  Boys.  Job well done.  If it wasn't for me, Bruce Mittman,  you wouldn't be where you are now.  Boys.  Boys.  I'm not going to get my $50 bonus.  I'm not going to get my $50 bonus.  Congratulations. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  You knocked me out of my bonus money slot.  You're taking food out of my mouth.  Now I've got something to fight about.  So you know what it's like?  It's like you guys got dumped by a chick.  Yeah.  Then you pick up a much hotter chick.  Right.  And not only do you pick up a hotter chick,  but you found out your old girlfriend  has a lump on her cervix.  Oh, God.  It's just great news all around.  All around.  All right.  Well, again, thank you, Boston. 
[00:33:30]  And we'll be up there very shortly.  Kind of sucks.  We can't fight with you anymore.  I mean, we'll swatch every once in a while  because that's always fun.  A little swat.  Swat.  A little smack.  A little acknowledgement  when you're doing another one of those phony,  I stole the tickets from Dave's office  how many goddamn times.  Hey, I stole the tickets from the boss's office  and I'll be giving them away all week long.  Hey, uh, and I got audio of, uh, uh, Rock Hole.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Thank God.  After that twat, uh, I fired him.  Okay. 
[00:34:00]  I'm looking into the future.  Into the future.  Sure.  Yeah.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nothing else.  Jeez.  Well, thank you, Boston.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Maybe you could still be the, uh, the king of Worcester. 
[00:34:30]  Why not?  Maybe.  So, in case you're, uh, keeping track at home,  uh, Opie and Anthony now number one in New York, Philly, and Boston.  Oh, Brucey.  Um, Brucey.  Bruce.  I saw your numbers, yes.  Uh, very nicely done.  Thank you, Mr. Mittman.  You know, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be where we are today.  Well, that's true, of course.  You discovered us and you invented WoW.  Well, no, I didn't invent WoW, but I did discover you.  Uh, uh, oh, by the way, FNX is on 1017. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yes.  Fine.  You are a pisser.  Uh, so, are you, are you calling, um, are you, uh, uh, going to congratulate us?  I congratulate you.  Yeah, thank you.  Good numbers, right?  Uh, they're very nice numbers.  Uh, I think that, uh, you inherited some very good numbers.  When, when did yours come out?  Oh, yes, that must have been it.  Well, you know something?  You will see.  Oh.  How do you think Dave Douglas is handling the, uh, news of Rocco getting beaten in all of 
[00:35:30]  the, uh, uh, demos?  Well, I...  Do you foresee a tantrum?  Oh, no.  I'm not going to start tantrum, but I certainly think he would be quite miserable.  Quite miserable.  That's all I want to hear.  I am so happy.  And what about that bitch in charge over there, Bruce?  Yeah, the bitch that took hold for you.  The one that took you a job.  Uh, no comment.  Oh, you're a pussy.  There is no way.  I'm a pussy.  There is no way somebody with a vagina can do the job of a Bruce Mittman. 
[00:36:00]  Did I notice you did well at YSB as well?  Yeah.  Oh, yes, you did if you, uh, looked at the Philly rating.  Yeah, I did, yeah, to see how, uh, the boys did, but not in New York.  What happened?  You went down in New York.  No, we didn't.  Where did we go, uh, to New York?  Yeah, I saw you went way backwards.  Way backwards?  You're insane, dude.  Are you a mad person, Bruce Mittman?  Would you like us to break out the New York numbers for you?  Uh, no, you know, I, I'm, I'm in the middle of the 17th hole right now. 
[00:36:30]  Uh, and, and Bruce, that explains 21st place.  Why so obsessed with ratings?  Yeah, where, where, where, where are, uh, where are your ratings, Bruce?  Excuse me if I can't hear you.  I lost you there.  Are they in the cup where your ball just, uh, went in?  Oh, oh, uh, well.  Are you on the golf course looking for O.J., with O.J. for the real killer and the ratings?  I think it's...  No, I've been looking for anthrax.  Yes, watch out.  I think it's...  Watch out, you guys might get some.  I think the ratings could be found in the pond where his golf ball just went. 
[00:37:00]  Well, uh, well, I've got a hit once, so nice talking to you, boys.  Thank you, Bruce.  And congratulations, and, uh, that's your last good book.  Okay, okay, Bruce.  We'll, we'll call you again in three months.  I look forward to it.  All right, we look forward to, uh, getting your resume.  Oh, uh, can I work for you now?  Oh, boy, I love that guy.  I can't get...  You know something?  You know how pathetic, though?  We said, uh, we need Bruce to, you know, Bruce on the show today?  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  He listens to us every day.  Instead of his own station.  There we go.  Calls right up.  Uh, hello, b-b-b-boys, b-b-b-boys.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got to move on to other things.  Yeah.  We're going to find Shemmy Chubchub.  Sports curse next?  Yes.  Thank God.  All right, we'll get into the sports curse next.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see your butt?  Let me tell you about my balloon nut.  The O.P.R.  I'm too very strong.  Radio's own slag. 
[00:38:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We do appreciate that.  Enough patting ourselves on the back.  Brian, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  All right.  I just wanted to congratulate you guys on the ratings in Philadelphia.  You're now officially number one with more men there than Tom Hanks.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, is Norton in there? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, Norton's here.  Norton's here.  Right here.  Hey, I just wanted to say I love you, buddy.  Thank you very much.  Thanks.  All right, later.  Bye.  He needs that quite literally.  Great reference, too.  Yes.  That was good.  I hate the reference.  Always good.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Tony, what's going down, man?  Yo, hey.  Hey.  I got a little survival tip for you tomorrow when you come down.  Yeah.  Don't wear any giant paraphernalia with the Monday night game coming up.  Uh-huh.  You know, it's funny you say that because we're all going to Philly tomorrow.  We have a whole day of activities planned.  Yeah.  And I was packing my bag because I'm crashing the city tonight because we got an early train 
[00:39:00]  tomorrow.  And I almost packed my Islander hat.  I'm like, am I insane?  That wouldn't be fun either, Ope.  No.  It would be even worse if it was a Rangers hat, but I think the Islanders are safe.  I don't think the Islanders are safe in Philadelphia, my friend.  You don't treat the Islanders like the little retarded brother that you've got to be nice  to anyway?  No.  Sometimes.  Because we know they suck.  They got a good team this year, my friend.  Well, as per the argument in the office, Ope says they are undefeated. 
[00:39:30]  Islanders still undefeated.  Yeah, but we know your curse, Ope.  They have.  We know we don't have to worry about that.  Now, I don't understand how they're undefeated when they lost the game the other night.  Oh, that was called an OL.  Right.  An overtime loss.  That's a new category this year in the NHL.  Yeah, but it's still a loss.  You say that they are undefeated because they have nothing in the L column.  Islanders still undefeated.  Yeah, remember, they added a fourth column.  So you still have an L in that loss column.  It really is ridiculous. 
[00:40:00]  There's this new rule in the NHL.  It's like if you tie at the end of regulation, you get a point.  Right.  And then if one of the teams wins in overtime, they get two points.  What?  So you get one point regardless.  Regardless.  It's like the Special Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Everyone wins.  Everyone's a winner.  Exactly what the Islanders are.  Special Olympics.  My friend, we have no losses in the L column.  Only one loss in the OL column.  It's still a loss, though.  That's a loss.  Oh, come on, Opie.  Admit it. 
[00:40:30]  It's still a loss.  No.  He won't admit it because the sports curse, he doesn't want to believe that it's that strong.  Well, good.  Maybe he'll curse you then and say that the Giants will win on Monday night.  Tony, it's funny, though, because, yeah, I was packing for Philly, and I really wanted to wear my Islanders hat.  I'm like, I'm going to get killed.  I'm not stupid.  I know there's a lot of people in Philly that enjoy our show, but let's not get crazy.  Right.  Well, but I look forward to going down there and watching an Islanders-Flyers game.  That's going to be incredible. 
[00:41:00]  But, so then I'm looking through my closet, and I got all these sports hats, and then I was thinking of wearing my 76ers hat.  Well, that'll be good.  The hat you guys sent us when we first got syndicated.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, then the New York people will kill me when I come back to New York.  Well, just make sure nobody sees you with it wearing.  So I think I'm going to go with the very safe hat that just says N-B-A on it.  Ah, that's pretty safe.  There's nothing else I can wear.  That's very safe, and we'll get you a Flyers hat when you get here. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, man.  You get a picture of me with a Flyers hat on.  A hundred bucks, my friend.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Sports curse.  Yeah.  This is amazing.  We've always talked about the Opie sports curse.  Whenever we're talking about sports or Opie's excited about a game in the NBA or something,  he'll call the winner.  He'll say, I think, you know, and give good reasons why he believes strongly that that team 
[00:42:00]  is going to win.  Not picking a winner and saying, I pick this and it's going to win.  Just his idea of why he believes a certain team will win, regardless of the sport.  And time and time again, that team, sometimes inexplicably, will lose.  All kidding aside, off the air, we were trying to think of the last time I picked a game right.  Yeah.  And we cannot think of one.  And then we sent it out to the listeners.  No one can remember the last time I picked a game.  Opie was very excited to be going to the Islanders' home opener. 
[00:42:30]  They were 4-0.  And they were playing Detroit at the Nassau Coliseum.  Opie, very excited.  And predicted that the Islanders would continue their winning streak and beat Detroit Red Wings.  No, you know, I mean, whatever.  I mean, the Islanders have to lose eventually.  So you say it's not that crazy.  Right.  But they gave up the tying goal with nine seconds left in the game.  Nine seconds, yeah.  And then went on to lose the game. 
[00:43:00]  It's an OL, but it's a loss.  All right, Ray.  That's amazing enough in itself.  OL is an Opie loss.  Right, an Opie loss.  But that pales in comparison.  A lot of the results of your sports curse pale in comparison with what has happened since Friday.  Amazing.  I got the tape of what I said Friday.  This is audio from Friday.  And my God, it is like Kreskin himself came in to predict this. 
[00:43:30]  Because it's exactly what happened is what I said would happen because of the sports curse.  Oh, you can hear it in Anthony's voice like, oh, my God.  I was like, there's hope.  There is hope for the Yankees.  Because it was like, it was said with passion.  Uh-huh.  It's not like, you know, you know, Opie's going to win.  You give me a couple teams.  You know, if I'm not feeling it, who cares?  But when I have that passion, it's over.  Now, when the Yankees played the A's at Yankee Stadium and lost the first two in a best out of five, you know, hey, there's the A's. 
[00:44:00]  They've got to win one more.  And they're going back to Oakland.  There's no way that the Yankees were going to win two in Oakland, come back to New York, and win and sweep three in a row like that.  And Opie made a point of letting everyone know this.  So here it is.  This is really audio from Friday.  Andy, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on with this sports curse, huh?  Ah, the sports curse is over, my friends.  Yankees are losing bad. 
[00:44:30]  And the Islanders, if you can believe it, are four and oh.  This can only lead me to believe the Yankees will pull such a miracle rally and win three in a row.  Anthony, I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to tell you, Yankees will be defeated by the A's.  Oh, my God.  Sports God, you heard that.  You heard that.  It's a Yankee sweep.  Not only are the Islanders 4-0, they're 4-0 on the road, have not played a home game yet. 
[00:45:00]  But that happens tomorrow and we're all going down.  With your sports curse, what could happen?  I see that big scoreboard at the Nassau Coliseum falling on the team.  That's the only thing that could happen when they have their home opener.  Oh, Vince.  He's coming up swinging.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  Oh, the Yankees win.  Nice.  The A's will beat the Yankees. 
[00:45:30]  Right there, I was like, oh, it's a three-game sweep.  I can't believe it.  And can I add that no team in history has ever, in a five-game set, lost the first two at home and then went on to win.  It never happened.  It never happened.  But you know something?  It could be no other way when Opie felt so strongly that the A's were going to win.  The best part is that he thought he had a sure thing.  Oh, yeah.  He just thought, you know what?  This is a no-brainer.  Well, you heard it in his voice.  Yeah.  Sports curse finally over. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  The Yankees losing badly.  Because I picked an easy one.  I'm like, I really want the sports curse over with.  Look, they lost the first two at home.  They're going back to Oakland.  It's over.  I need the sports curse to leave my body.  So, yeah, I went out on a limb.  So, your people in Oakland can be pissed off at Opie.  Pluto.  So, Opie, you are the biggest jinx since Mrs. O'Leary's AIDS-infected cow.  Oh, my God.  You better hope this does not translate over to war or else I swear to God I will come down there and put a turban on you and force you to grow a beard and not shower. 
[00:46:30]  It's just sports, my friend.  I want that guy from Oakland that called up Friday mocking me and Rick and the Yankees.  Remember that guy he called up and was like, where are you Yankees, tool?  Kicking your ass.  Steve, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey.  Baggots.  What's up?  Hey, Opie, first I'd like to say congratulations.  Wow.  You made me $2,000 richer.  Two grand.  Yeah.  If you didn't bet, I don't understand why people aren't just walking around rich. 
[00:47:00]  All I got to say is this.  I am a diehard Mets fan.  Hate the Yankees.  Can't stand them.  Yeah.  But Opie said they're going to lose.  There's no way they can lose.  Yeah.  Friday, you had an empty blank check.  You had a blank check Friday when Opie said that to earn money.  I mean, why the hell wouldn't you do it?  It's like bending over and picking up a pile of cash on the floor.  It was free money.  That easy.  Free money.  Hey, Opie, how much do you love your listeners? 
[00:47:30]  A lot.  Okay.  How about every Friday, since you love your listeners so much, you give your predictions?  He can't do it that way.  It doesn't work.  It has to be when there's passion involved.  It's got to be the real deal.  Yeah.  I will not pick games.  You just have to listen close enough to realize when he's saying something and go, oh, there  it is.  That's what I'm looking for.  Friday was a perfect example.  I purposely bite my tongue.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  I just want this to go away.  I just love how sure he sounded.  Friday.  Sports curse over.  Yankees losing badly.  It was over.  Opie, I just want to say I love you and I'm going to go listen now and hear you call me  a dick.  All right.  You know how we're all obviously afraid of the anthrax in the mail.  I don't know if you know it.  Sports teams are actually afraid to open their mail and find a picture of Opie.  It's miraculous.  With their hat on or something, you know?  It really is amazing. 
[00:48:30]  It's all kidding aside.  How freaked out am I in the back office?  He is like he is like a lunatic in the back.  I had a whole.  You don't even want to talk about it when he first came in.  Yeah.  I had a whole conversation with yourself about the Rangers and Islanders.  I will not say what I said because I didn't want to jinx either team.  Ah, you want to hear what Opie said in the back office?  No, no, no, no, no.  Islanders, much better team.  Rangers stink.  They have a horrible team.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  I don't know what that even holds any water. 
[00:49:00]  Dan.  Yo.  What's up, man?  That's a John Edwards prediction, Rick.  I can't hear.  You can see into it many ways.  John Edwards.  I'm picking up somebody dead.  They did a great skit on that on SNL.  They're showing how much of a tool that guy really is.  I missed that one.  Ah, yes, Dan.  What's up?  Yeah.  Am I on the air?  Yeah.  Yes.  You guys, man.  You guys are a bunch of freaking tools.  Why?  You're looking for competition.  Skit.  I don't know.  He's cursing like a sell.  I know.  Thank you. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you very much.  All right.  So, hey, we got a new Joey Balls and Kaminoosh song about the Yankees.  Oh.  These guys, man.  Do we have a little of the original?  Because that would be nice.  Because I think they updated their sound a little.  These two guys from New York, you know, the Yankees, been doing very well for quite a number of years now.  And they've been writing these songs, these Yankee, little rah-rah songs. 
[00:50:00]  Remember, we heard this the first time in the stadium before the start of one of the games.  Remember that?  Of course.  We were goofing on it.  It's two ginzos.  I hate this thing.  Here it is.  They're good guys, too.  This is the first one?  They play this at the stadium to the point where you want to just smash your skull in.  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:50:30]  Isn't this awful-looking noise?  How you doing?  Why?  Why?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Well, they wrote a new one.  And it's got a little updated sound.  The same type of thing.  A little guitar in it, Opie.  And it's a little different.  You know, it needs to be said, by the way, that the A's were asked to lose that series. 
[00:51:00]  Were they?  To make us feel better here in New York.  I think that will be reported soon.  Somebody will say the morale of the country, it was in our best interest to have the A's  lose that series.  Well, then it would mean that the Yankees have to go all the way because, you know, a World  Series win for the Yankees.  New York needs a boost of pride and excitement.  But, no, the fact of the matter is that the only team that could pull off something so 
[00:51:30]  ridiculous is the Yankees.  And this show is syndicated to Seattle and Opie does not like the Yankees.  So, Mariner fans have nothing to look forward to.  I don't care who he picks.  The only reason they didn't lose in Cleveland is because it's impossible for two syndicated  cities to lose when they're playing each other.  Right.  Right.  I don't, um, I'm not even going to ask Opie and no one will and I'm sure he won't fess  up to it.  I can only believe in my head that he actually believes that the Mariners have a slight edge 
[00:52:00]  over the Yankees and will walk away winning this next series.  I believe that's what he believes.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to hear it.  That's my opinion.  It doesn't matter, though, because technically, as far as he's concerned, the Yankees are no  longer playing because they were supposed to lose to the A's.  So, it is an impossibility because they shouldn't be playing.  What a paradox.  Yes.  I'll do a little John Edwards thing.  It's bizarro, Lord.  John Edwards.  I'll do a little, like, meh, around about thing here.  And people are going to have to interpret it? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  You've got to appreciate a team like the Seattle Mares.  Right.  After losing Rodriguez and Griffey to have the year they had.  Okay.  You've got to love that as a baseball fan.  Wait a minute.  Listen.  Listen to Seattle.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  They're screaming.  They're screaming in Seattle.  I hear it.  I hear it over the air.  As a fan, you've got to love that the team gets rid of their two best players and they  go on to pretty much set the record for wins in a season. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  You've got to appreciate that.  Oh, my God.  Hey, can you hear it?  Let's be quiet.  Listen.  What's coming from Seattle?  Listen.  Listen close.  Shut up!  Wow.  Shut up!  They saved millions of dollars on their payroll.  Oh, my God.  And to have the season they had.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That is like a true message.  Shut up! 
[00:53:30]  Shut up!  Quiet.  Shut up, Demi.  That's all I have to say about that.  Oh, God.  Hey, it was like a John Edwards song.  It can be interpreted in many different ways.  Right.  It doesn't mean anything.  Kurt Cobain just shot himself again.  All right.  So, we have the new How You Doing song, Anthony.  Oh, great.  From Joey Balls and Kamenucha.  Yeah.  All right.  A little updated sound here.  Let's...  Well...  Oh. 
[00:54:00]  Hey, Joey Baseball.  How you doing?  Oh, Kamenucha.  I'm doing so much better.  How you doing?  Listen.  We just got a phone call from Maeve Giuliani.  He wants us to do a little something special for the Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  This is going to go out to all the heroes in New York.  Wait a minute.  Here it is.  New York.  Hey, you.  Oh, God.  Ha, ha, ha.  This is awful.  New York.  Hey, you.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, you.  Hey.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:54:30]  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  The Pinstrikes.  26 championships.  Operation Yankee Dynasty moves on.  How you doing?  It's going down in the Bronx again.  We're going to get you.  Still the greatest city in the world.  In the greatest country in the world.  How you doing?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Ha, ha.  New York.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:55:00]  Crackling Rosie.  Get on board.  But what's with all these miserable and the Taliban?  Miserables.  You know, trying to stop freedom is like trying to stop the Yankees.  You can't do it.  How you doing?  You can't stop me.  I'm still taking a four train.  And I'm still sneaking into the stadium.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Do your way.  Ha, ha, ha.  Every other city is openly laughing at us today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a consolation right here to Oakland.  What do you do?  How you doing?  That at least their team doesn't have this song. 
[00:55:30]  I'm on my way to pick up some of New York's bravest.  At New York's finest.  We're going to the game.  And we're sick with the bleach.  The creatures.  How you doing?  Oh, God.  And the Yankees going hands in hand.  They were down but never out.  Never underestimate the heart of a champion.  How you doing?  Oh, God.  Oh.  Yankees.  How you doing?  New York.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[00:56:00]  How you doing, Kaminoosh?  Yankees.  It's your boss.  Are you ready for the four piece?  Are you ready for the four piece?  I'll tell you what I'm ready for.  I'm ready for my name Janus and V. Bruno.  Get that beer company on the phone. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, they check who's in there.  Go balls.  Go balls.  Go balls.  Yeah.  I mean, they don't even say it right.  How you doing?  Hey, New York.  Jokes aside.  You keep your chin up.  That's right.  Don't forget.  We all got a big fight to win.  God bless America.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh.  Let me tell you something.  To the other radio stations that want to play that as a serious song,  you can find it on Prepburger.  I got to say something. 
[00:57:00]  As an Italian, that pretty much, as an Italian, listening to that is like if a black guy is  listening to something going, well, Lordy Lord, we's going to get us some fried chicken  and warty melon.  I mean, what kind of a stereotypical, how you doing?  That's like the Knicks song.  Yeah.  You know that stupid Knicks song they have?  Oh, my God.  Team songs always stink.  How you doing? 
[00:57:30]  Super Bowl shuffle, my friend.  Oh, God.  Not the Super Bowl shuffle.  Was that 85, though?  That was a nice little odd day.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing, sweet Caroline?  How you doing?  How you doing?  When you walk through the door, how you doing?  I am, I said, with no one else. 
[00:58:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  That song is...  Yankees are on the rocks.  Awful.  Never count them out.  All right.  Let's go, Mets go.  Come on, 86.  Oh, that stunk.

Oh, that is brutal.  Heck of a time.  Whatever.  Oh, who let the vikes out?  Who let the vikes out?  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  I've never heard a team song that didn't make me want to pick up a knife and slash somebody.  Yeah, really bad.  Really bad.  They're terrible.  The Mets had another one. 
[00:59:00]  They've had them.  Well, who let the dogs out was the team song a couple of years.  Everybody was like, yeah, that's the Mets song.  Who let the Mets out?  Stunk.  All right.

[01:06:00]  four four four none in the lost column none even in the overtime lost column it's just you are four  four four four right and uh we had the girl that was the expert on uh the back door thing on the  ace x the ace x balloon knot action tristan and uh she uh yeah she bent over and we we uh took a look  took a little gander and opi uh guessed her age it's amazing so check this out hey what's going on

[01:09:30]  yeah it's hilarious from start to finish yeah it's great to pop in you know get some guys around i  turn a lot of people on to you from that yeah i just want to know if there's anything that works  as far as something current coming out uh some new material a little neo diamond  demented world a cd that you cannot find anywhere that's a smart move if you own a record company  i've tried to burn that thing a few times with some people yeah that that's a whole nother story  about uh yeah early in our career getting abused was that something that uh they they pushed you 
[01:10:00]  to put out or did you guys no we wanted to uh put it out we were very happy with it and uh we thought  it was a great thing we were up in boston we did signings uh we thought we were getting involved  with a real radio company that would be able to you know a record company yeah uh a record company  excuse me that would be able to you know get that cd out there for everybody that thing kicks  you know i'm in jail my favorite you know that uh that cd the mental world that we put out when  we were in boston it's uh it sold over 40 000 copies mostly in boston do you know that we've  been in new york for over three years and uh i think we've sold maybe maybe 2 000 down here 
[01:10:30]  and why because you can't find it you can't find it because the guy that runs the record company  decided for some reason he wasn't going to put it in stores wasn't going to support it  um and wasn't going to pay us for it well you got you guys put a few clips i've heard on the air  there oh yeah oh yeah yeah we play some of the stuff still uh the next cd cringe we had it all done  two years ago oh god yeah oh you're gonna have a heart attack uh it was it was uh it was a day 
[01:11:00]  away from going to the cd plant swear to god yeah it was going to be pressed the next day the next day  and uh lawyers got involved and squashed the whole prod project for some reason gary wall  our uh pd at the time said kept saying don't worry about it don't worry about it opie was saying  uh look gary there's some bits on here that i i don't know if the lawyers are going to have a  problem with just because not because they should have had a problem with it but just because uh with  past dealings with them we knew that there would be something up and gary was just like don't worry 
[01:11:30]  about no it's all taken care of everything's fine everything's fine day before it goes to press  uh guys they had a problem with a couple of tracks uh how many uh gary and how many did it turn out  to be um we had we had 61 tracks it was going to be a double cd and uh oh man at least should have  been at least 39 to 40 tracks oh more than that it was it was about saying that's conservative 80  percent of the tracks so ridiculous i i put easily 200 hours into the project and uh i i mean here it is 
[01:12:00]  right here here it is here here it is these are the masters that never never made it out there  no let's go put them out well now we got to redo the whole thing yeah now there's stuff on here you  know quite frankly we don't want years old yeah so know what i would like to do um i i we would  love to put out a you know another cd and maybe you know uh give all the money to charity that would  be good you know there's a lot of people hurting here in new york city i would love to i don't know 
[01:12:30]  what the turnaround time is but i would love to try to get something out there immediately  well you know it's a lot better now than before you get a lot more listeners we don't need the  you know the money there's a lot of people down here that do and i think it would be a great thing  so i don't know we'll talk uh off the air and see if we can make that happen in the near future  good idea all right hey looking forward to it thank you john thanks for the support up there we  greatly appreciate that yeah you guys are well known around here we were kind of scared you guys  forgot about us oh are you kidding so go away thanks john get my signs up for tomorrow too

[01:34:00]  what's up perry  yeah  how you doing  davarro's over there  how you doing  steven and eric  no that's martine  that's martine  hey  there we go  there you go  alright  we can get eric  on the phone for you  if you like  oh  who's that  that's martine  lenoble  oh i'm sorry mark  martine  right on  so this truly is a  surprise  out there  uh this is a huge  surprise yeah  we did this under  the radar  it was a little uh  little surprise that  we uh put together  a little trick  huge fans of james 
[01:34:30]  addiction  i was we were  driving and steve  we were driving  past your building  and steve said  pull over  the mark and bryan  show i said  awful  the amos and andy show  the amos and andy  we've gotten that one  opie and dopey  we've heard it all  yeah  we've heard it all  it's been a while  so you guys uh  you guys came up from what  north carolina you're saying  well they did the garden  last night  behind the garden last  night but ben got to go  to the show he said it  was unbelievable 
[01:35:00]  we got more garden in us  than north carolina right  now  yeah a lot we got a lot  more new york in us  definitely than north carolina  so i was just wondering  about the travel situation  hey  you take the bus  you take the bus though  right  all right perry's a little  happier now  we took care of him  we figured you need a  little pick me up there  thank you for the lap  dance  all right  we could have arranged  that  we travel greyhound  so let's let's get the  obvious out of the way  how does it feel to be  back in new york i mean  it's uh it's a little  strange here with 
[01:35:30]  everything that has been  going on the anthrax and  the terrorist attacks  any thoughts perry  dave  it sounds like new york to  me i mean  yeah really  doesn't sound much  different than the new  york i remember  you're not feeling a  different energy on the  street  you know what man  uh of course i do  but you know at the  same time  i am not gonna uh slow  down from enjoying  myself i don't think uh  it's the new york way  yeah  i think it 
[01:36:00]  before this there was  there was muggers and  and murderers you know  what i mean  the good old days right  well look how many cases  of anthrax as opposed to  how many murders were  committed  it's really not  any different  right  if you want to look at  it on that level except  for the fact if you if  you'd lost a loved one  okay and be deeply  serious of course it's  different  i'm just trying to keep a  a good uh frame of mind  and keep a keep peace  you know what i mean  and keep on going 
[01:36:30]  that's the way i deal  with it  right on  colton get in your head  though when you're out  i don't know  i can't  sometimes you open an  envelope or something  and that freaks you out  it used to be just  second nature  and now you  well i did get a package  this morning that i did  put calls out to trace it  really  yeah i really did  and it ended up being  some really cool  belt buckles  so there you go  you know the mail is a  good thing  and who the hell is  sniffing white powder  these days  right  exactly  screw that crap  yeah exactly  how you doing dave  i'm doing really good man 
[01:37:00]  yeah  and in answer to your  question um  personally  it does it does feel  a little um  a little tense  out on the streets  and a little um  i don't know  a little  i feel very sensitive  to the situation  that's going on  and the cool thing  about us coming  last night  is that  it was a magic  that was in  in the house  you know  that i think we all  felt and  and shared with the  audience  and i think it was  you know a real nice  coming together  for for us  and for you know  the people who came  to see us  and um  we all had a really 
[01:37:30]  good time  and like perry said  it's like we're not  going to you know  avoid you know  experiencing life  and sharing it with  people and um  that was evident last  night we had a really  really good time  yeah the garden was  rocking everyone had  a great time  it was one big huge  party  people want to get  out and have some  fun you know  rock again  as they should  hell yeah  hey you know  this is something  i've been uh  you know keeping  inside for about  10 years  why the hell did  you guys ever break  up  you guys were one  of my fames  at the time man  oh thanks  well we're playing  again so  i don't know 
[01:38:00]  but there's like  a 10 year gap in there  that i'm not going to  get back  to be honest with you  i don't know if we  ever really did  i mean i think that  we went and did other  things and the cool  thing that i have found  is that when we got  together as jane's  addiction  the four of us came  from completely  different musical  backgrounds  and then we kind of  brought those  influences together  and became what we  were  whereas now that  there's been this  10 year lapse  as you pointed out  we're able to have  our own life  experiences  our own musical  influences  and yet bring  those back  together again 
[01:38:30]  for a freshness  that we had  back in you know  the early days  so it's almost  like we still  are maintaining  a freshness  that we had  when the original  magic happened  i think  so you're not  fighting at all  you're probably  just having a  ball huh  steven  oh no we're  completely at it  trevish  yeah right  it's been a living  hell out here  but yeah we do  love each other  very much  and this is  actually the best  it's been  ever  yeah  and i think  the potential  is still even  ahead  better potential  is ahead of us  i gotta ask  the obvious  i mean maybe  an album 
[01:39:00]  any of that  any of that  talk going around  i think maybe  is a good word  carrie would you  like to do  another album  with these guys  yeah  yeah  yeah  cool  i think that's  one of those  things i mean  i think we all  love that  i would love to  see that  i think it's  just you know  we've been  doing this now  for a couple  weeks and you  know it is  exciting and fresh  and especially  given the state  of you know  the world  we're just  we're really  doing this  for the right  reasons  you know  what i mean  which is  to spread 
[01:39:30]  happiness  and you know  the jubilee  things about  awareness  and that tour  and this is  just such a  perfect time  for that  and i would  love to see  that happen  i just at the  same time  i don't think  any of us  are willing  to you know  commit yeah  for sure  that's going  to happen  because you  know there's  a lot of  factors at play  but i think  that in our  hearts we love  to make music  together  and that's  all that matters  you just put  out of cd  and it's uh  it's well  received  thank you  you know  someone has  a question  here uh  yakov  what's up  yeah james addiction 
[01:40:00]  why are you  guys so depressing  wake up  scumbag  maggots  mullabella  jesus  they're just  they're just  mellow  they had a huge  show last night  at the garden  they're playing  jersey tonight  we're not  depressed  we're tired  yeah  they're beat  they probably  slept two hours  so far  anyway i saw  your movie  jerky boy  and it sucked  i mean that's  just proof that  new york in  its essence  is still the  same  so there you  go  yeah everybody  was cool to  each other  i'm curious as  to what show 
[01:40:30]  he's listening  to because  we're sitting  here talking  about how  happy we are  and how you  know we're  looking forward  to the future  and like the  jubilee and  like unity  yelling or  something about  it  perry's got the  white wine in  front of him  you're happy  right perry  life's good  right  oh yeah  you're gonna  come up with  any more festivals  for us hopefully  i'm thinking  about it  yeah  do you want  to hear about  them they're  kind of  depressing  we talked  to you a few  years back  in boston  and you had  this great  idea for a  festival where  people would  camp out all  night and  it never really 
[01:41:00]  got off  and something  had to do  with some  kind of ufo  thing  there were  ufos involved  right  yeah yeah  well no  what i did  was i was  putting out  signals in  the space  right  using just  alchemical  they were  kind of  it's kind  of a crossover  into musical  theories  and playing  out these  sounds that  were actually  they were  compounds like  mineral compounds  just to see if  i'd get any  response back  get a response 
[01:41:30]  back  yeah like  what would you  send these out  musically what  you're singing  you're singing  musically the  symbols of  garnet or  or onyx  you know  that is so  far out  there  i cannot  even  like i'm just  thinking close  encounters  uh...  boop boop  this is  this was legit  but uh...  so how  what would you  no i'm trying to  figure out  this was no movie  what would you  use  no but we can't  just sit here and  nod and say  yeah  what would you  use  probably  like  to make the  sound 
[01:42:00]  for example  use the  vla  no no you  can use a  keyboard  right  what you can  do is you  can find  mineral compounds  like the  equations for  mineral compounds  and you can  equate that  with a  musical  composition  yeah  you can  break it  down and  translate that  into music  you know  what i mean  using hebrew  alphabet you  can do it  holy jesus  wow  so then  what made you  think of this  because i  thought like  if you want  to talk to  ufo  it's an  immaculate 
[01:42:30]  language  they don't  have to  know latin  or you know  anything like  that this is  immaculate  it's gotta be a  basic thing  this is a  scientific but  using math  i mean using  science but  but um  breaking it down  and translating it  into into musical  formula  this is amazing  i thought that  if anybody  was a ufo  they'd be smart  enough to figure  it out  and they would  shoot back to  sound  you were there  you were at the  party  you were at the  party  that's why i'm  smiling  and i think 
[01:43:00]  we worked out  over dinner  and some aliens  definitely showed  up at the party  right  you never got  anything back  though  it had nothing  to do with the  weed right  steven  no that was a  great night  actually  or was that a  week  oh it was a  week night  it took a week  wow  but the whole  festival didn't  really take off  because you needed  like the venues  to stay open all  night and stuff  i remember at the  time  it's like this  no one would  really work with  you  i know  you'd like to  have a blonde  with big boobs  and long legs  but sometimes  you know  her legs  aren't so long 
[01:43:30]  what i'm trying  to say is  so we couldn't  stay open all  night but we  did get the  alien compounds  out there  we got some  great music  we had a  communal meal  should i say  more  what else  do you want  to know  have they  written your  back  the aliens  have they  contacted your  back  well i don't  think we know  because it  takes so long  you guys are  poking funny  with those messages  to travel  no we're trying  to understand  there's a big  difference  i'm trying  to understand  because i'm  not going to  sit here and  make believe i 
[01:44:00]  completely understand  where you're going  it takes a while  to get out there  to tell you the  truth  okay i'll be  honest with you  i was kind of  kidding  okay i can deal  with that  because you know  to a lot of  people you you  come across and  i was trying to  board  were you  i actually did  do this  somebody who's  so like you  know  smart but in  actuality i am  no no yeah yeah  that's where are  you going here 
[01:44:30]  definitely definitely  smart but but  somewhere where you're  like wow i cannot  relate with someone  like this on any  level  i'll break it  down for you  if if i were to  try to put out  let's just say i was  being ditzy and i  want to put out a  signal out in the  space i i know  where there is  there is um  it's science it's  like breaking down  equations kabbalah  with hebrew alfa with  the hebrew alphabet  you can go across the  board and understand 
[01:45:00]  things like emotions  emotions i could be  explaining to you  emotions using hebrew  alphabet exact emotion  i could also take that  principle and assign it  to uh mathematics or  or music so somebody  musical theory for you  with it so it would be  like universal so  somebody would be able  to pick this up and  understand what you're  trying to convey even  though they don't know  it's universal language  okay you don't look at  it as hebrew look at it  as a universal language  an eerie  universal language 
[01:45:30]  okay ready to jump  out at you did you  find them under your  back  i found them to be  very very um forgiving  and uh horny  you weren't anally  probed were you  was i  no no that's what  they do when they  i have been  should i talk about  it  but not but not by  an alien  no  well she said she  wasn't an alien but  i didn't believe her  wow  that's something  because she knew all 
[01:46:00]  the formulas for onyx  amethyst  we can all relate to  the music though  but they were alien  objects  all right enough with  the goddamn close  encounters music  at pool  that was too easy  i'm sorry perry  i apologize to you  personally  do you guys mind if  we don't do the show  tonight in jersey and  just stay here  you're liking the  because i think we are  a hit  we don't  call back  come on  they love us  we were a little  nervous having you guys  come in and we don't  get nervous often  what were you nervous 
[01:46:30]  about  i don't know  you guys are like  what do you think  might happen  because you guys are big  i've read all the articles  i mean perry gets out  there and i want to try  to you know  i want to kind of look  cool to perry  well you don't  sorry about that  but i think you're a pretty  decent guy  it ain't working  i know  sandra what's up  you do man  you remind me of those  guys in laguna beach  that would let me surf  their surf spot  if anybody knows 
[01:47:00]  i think that's a  girls  he's kind of cute  blue eyed  and he looks like he  just came from  california  sandra what's up  hey  hey we're hanging  with jane's addiction  i know you are  i'm so jealous right now  i just want to say  i saw you guys last night  and you actually were  amazing and i was so  honored to see you  where were you  um madison square garden  i know but where were you  i was like maybe 30 feet  when you guys went to  the little stage  yeah yeah  and oh you guys  that was you  yeah  i told you i saw that  girl  yeah you know 
[01:47:30]  we made eye contact  what was your favorite  part of the show  sandra  well we all uh  probably when we  played three days  yeah  right on  yeah  yeah that was great  all right  so i want to say  good luck tonight  and put on a great show  like you did last night  any questions for the guys  they're all here  oh god i can't even  think right now  i absolutely love you guys  we know how you feel  i might spell that  all right sandra  thank you  thank you  all right  let's see what john has  john what's up  hey opi and you guys  rock i got a question  for uh perry 
[01:48:00]  okay  you still shooting the dope  oh jesus christ  you guys made the best  music when you guys  were high  and you still make  great music  well thanks a lot  i think you already  answered my question  going into all that  alien and metal stuff  that doesn't have to  that doesn't have to be  some kind of drug  induced thing  you rock  now look look  this is what  this is what it is  there's a mandate  don't shoot dope man  i don't want anybody  shooting dope  and here's why  you shot enough  for everybody  that's right  because i want 
[01:48:30]  i want the rest of it  no  not really  the reason is  because the money  that most of that  um dope is coming  um coming in here  is going to  support terrorism  did you know that  like uh opium  yeah the opium trade  is brought into this  country and like  okay so  fair enough  it might feel okay  but then you know  all the sadness  and and um  all the rest of it  man it's a  trail of tears  so to support 
[01:49:00]  my brothers  i say  you know what  i got my spliff  and i got  you know  i've got my red bull  and vodka  quality vodka  we bought you guys  and when they really  care about me  they get me a good  bottle of wine  and you know  who picked that wine  i told you  i didn't say anything  what are you guys  coming to here  i'm just trying to  let you know  something about wines  but you sent somebody else  no man let me just  get to my point  all we did was  we threw as much  money as possible  and said get a good  bottle of white wine 
[01:49:30]  i am half teasing  no you're not  which means  all i'm trying to say  is man there's a lot  of ways to enjoy  put it this way  if you cannot have  a good time  with a little glass  of wine  some girls  and some good music  then i am sorry man  i can't help you  you gotta go to  somebody else's party  yeah  and all the other stuff  was in a way  trying to block  the fact that  a lot of the parties  sucked  and also  you know  there's a lot of  good reasons  not to use it now  so i don't know  you do your thing  but for me  you know i'm over it 
[01:50:00]  you just stopped  yeah  wow  that's pretty good  did you have any help  or you just said  screw this  well i don't need help  i got a good life  i don't need it  that's cool  steven you're awfully  quiet over there  you want to add  anything to this mess  yeah i'm happy  my friends rock drugs  thank you steve  it makes your life  a lot easier right  i love these guys  so much  yeah okay  let's uh go to liz  liz what's up  hi  hi  i just want to tell you  guys that i love you  i've been listening to you  for like forever  i went to you 
[01:50:30]  when you fit at waterloo  you got the splicer on  don't you  yeah let's try again  your phone was crap  okay here wait  i'm pulling over  can you hear me better  yeah  okay i've been loving  you guys for forever  so you're the first  lalapalooza at waterloo  and like  and soul kissed  and all that  ass back then  old school  she's an alien  i am an alien  did you understand me  basically  see we're speaking  the language of love  she went to the first 
[01:51:00]  lalapalooza loved it  yeah  yeah  in your opinion perry  what happened with  lalapalooza  got too commercial  well uh  it's just the way  things go man  sometimes  everything comes together  and it bakes a pie  you know  and then uh  sometimes  it's just not the right  ingredients  or you're out of  ingredients  and your latest idea  my latest idea  here it is  man  here we are  no i mean  another festival  possibly  i'd love to do it 
[01:51:30]  again  but i want to  like i say  i want to make sure  it's good  i mean i want to do  it for the right  reasons  i think we've got  a lot of enthusiasm  and and um  good good um  causes behind us  and the guys are  in a good state of  mind and we're  making music  i say that music  should just  music and art  should flourish  this year  whether i'm  exactly um  attached to it  or whether i'm  spectating it  i think that  the part  of the solution  that we're  missing here 
[01:52:00]  is uh  there's a lot  of voices  that are being  heard  you know  you've got  extreme people  being heard  you've got  politicians  being heard  you've got  uh  big companies  being heard  and then we  get our  asses bombed  i think that  um  we need our  voices too  the people  on the streets  need their  voices  because you're  not hearing  all the voices  i don't care  what anybody  says  i would sit  down with a  palestinian  musician  and play  and i'm a jew  and i guarantee  you my voice  as a jew  is different  you know 
[01:52:30]  it's a different  voice than what  you would think  what the jews  say this  the palestinians  say that  islam says  this  the christians  who is they  i'm a voice  individuals  we're all  individuals  yeah but i mean  like they say  the think this  about them  that's  you don't lump  everybody  right  don't you think  the internet  has helped that  well yeah the  internet rocks  and i think  as i say  i want to get  back to art  art is a great  expression of a  voice and music 
[01:53:00]  is a very very  loud roar  what bands  are you listening  to and who  would you like  to have  at a festival  yeah i like  to dj a lot  but there's  amazing  freak  thank you  you are too  freak in a good  way  exactly  get into it  yeah freaky  freaky  but i think  that you're  going to see  i think  artists should  step up  because that  shows right  off the street  what the  voice is really  of a lot  more people  than just  some guy  in a company  you know  that voice 
[01:53:30]  he's not  really  he's a  what do you  call it  there's  ventriloquists  and there's  puppets  you know  that's what  i see a lot  of  all right  let's go  to jinxie  jinxie  what's up  hi  i just wanted  to talk to  perry for a  moment  i missed you  at all your  djing gigs  recently  oh sorry  hear that  i am very  upset about it  i wanted to  interview you  well dance it  out kid  well i would  if i could afford  tickets to your  show  and what are you  trying to say  do you really

[02:04:00]  which you do as a kid  all day long  but as you get older  you start to think about it  you might not have run  as fast as you can  for a long time  you should do it  every day at recess  so i i did  is that what you're  talking about right  yeah dude  yeah  you still do that  but do you do  that's my point  yeah  wow  you gotta do it  the true jane's way  with the police chasing you  i had one more question  uh anthony threw it out  there before  but i didn't hear an answer  if you were to put together  a festival  who would you invite  yeah what kind of bands 
[02:04:30]  would you uh  i listen to left field stuff  all the time  you can't hear anything  good on the radio  that's why i listen to these guys  hear them talk  well for  first  you know  speaking of left field  they're pretty good too  no no  there's a crew  called left field  they're like uh  innovators  techno innovators  well what  it's more like  i would look at it  more like um  i would change the size  and the shape of the thing  and i would  i would not have  quite as many live acts  maybe quite  a few live acts 
[02:05:00]  and then i would go more  into the electronic  and then i would bring in  a lot more of the world  beat  the offbeat  you know  kind of gypsy king  slash femi cootie  kind of thing  and  um  keep the parties  a little smaller  and uh  make sure that there's  a lot more women  can't argue with that  women always good  Perry  yes  i heard the women  on the stage last night  were amazing  they had little just  little pasties on  that was about it  they're great spirits man  but these gals  besides being  drop dead gorgeous 
[02:05:30]  are just  they're hot dancers  they're old school  like  trained dancers  and they  they can  what they can do  with their legs  close your eyes  nice  i know i gotta let you go  but there's a  there's a science teacher  on the phone line  that wants to  talk about your  alien theory  who is this  mary  hey you guys  hi  how are you doing  hey Perry  hi mary  how are you doing  i'm doing so well  i just want to tell you  that i just  got out of a 
[02:06:00]  i am a real  earth science teacher  i just got out of a  meeting  i turned on the radio  i've been dying to  talk to you about  your theory  i just heard it  the alien theory  right  yeah  i just wanted to  tell you  i think it's very  elegant  because i'm a  geologist  and i was curious  as  you know that  they have a  resonation  every mineral  has its own  resonation  that's right  okay so there you  go  that's absolutely  right  all right  so tell these  guys  that's absolutely  true  plus the fact  you know you have  to kind of groove  on the fact that  the universe  only has a certain  amount of elements  in it 
[02:06:30]  and other planets  you know have  the same elements  in them  so you know all the  minerals are made up  of certain elements  hydrogen  carbon  let's read them  off  hydrogen  carbon  there you go  helium  oxygen  oxygen  there's four  that's it  and that's it  and i was curious  as to what  what minerals  do you use  i would think  that you'd want  to use like  you know  like  well  there's no  pop quiz  i know  diamonds 
[02:07:00]  diamonds is a  good one  salt  that's a good  well that's a  very high  pressure element  so  to tell you  the truth  i had only  three  three minerals  i actually can't  remember them  right now  but they were  minerals  they were  you know  something you'd  find onyx  or something  like that  like a stone  and i happened  to know  by reading  this book  what it was  and so  i just put it  out just for fun  it was just  amongst the other  things  do you think  if the aliens  got him  and they went  look at the  minerals he picked  i'm not even  getting in touch  with this guy  like you were  so close 
[02:07:30]  but you just  picked the wrong  minerals  right  all right  mary  oh wait  one more question  do you have  any geology  background  perry  no no  but you know  what i am  studying right  now  last good  point  i'm studying  right now  something called  the phoenix  phoenix project  and what it is  it's how to  take the  world's energy  and put it  into hydrogen  what do you  think about that  mary  put it  into hydrogen  yeah invest  all it  we have to  stop what  we're doing  with with  fossil fuel 
[02:08:00]  and invest  put our time  and efforts  into hydrogen  hey you ever see  the hindenburg  my friend  that's a good idea  thing went up  like a flash cube  no come on  don't dispel this  thing  i'm not  i'm just saying  how do you  control hydrogen  to make it  less dangerous  it's not dangerous  hydrogen is not  dangerous fuel  it burns into  it turns into  vaporizes into  water fume  yeah  no  just water vapor  that's it  steam  yeah  it is the safest  and it's the  and it is the most  out of all the 
[02:08:30]  resources  out of all  you can marry  something  out of all  the resources  we've got  in the whole  universe  yeah  the fuel  that is used  most by the  universe  and it's a  natural  is hydrogen  that's right  stars live on  hydrogen  they absorb  hydrogen  why aren't we  using the  hydrogen  this is it  they will  in the next  10 years  because it's  very low  density  and it  floats out  of our  atmosphere  that's why  it's hard  to hold on  to  yeah but  we can  remove this  from  we can  remove them  from the  atoms  from water  yeah we 
[02:09:00]  all atoms  have hydrogen  we can  like in  between  gigs  we have  no we  have the  capabilities  to be out  there with  a net  mark my words  in the next  10 years  they're calling  it the  hydrogen  economy  because  that's  what they're  titling it  within the  next 10  years  the world  will go  over to  hydrogen  because  we're  exhausting  our  natural  resources  and we  need to  do  we've got  to cut you  off  these guys  got to  get to  a show  in  Jersey  man  you know  what  before we  go

[02:14:00]  one in Boston  and one in New  York  right down the  road  look at that  oh my god  you know what I  learned today  I can live to  a lot  I can live to be  a hundred  and I will never  ever be as cool  as those effing  guys that were  just in the studio  well you know  I like to think  I'm hip  I like to think  I'm out there  a little bit  yeah  those guys  now that's out  there  rock  Perry is  so far out  there  yeah maybe 
[02:14:30]  that's it  I don't know  you know  if I ever went  to a party  like he'd be  the guy  that everyone's  hanging around  and he could  just be talking  about hey  hydrogen  whatever  and people like  hanging with him  and stuff  everyone's you know  having fun with  their drugs and  everything  and listening to  him  then I'd just  be like  I don't know  what to say  you just sit  there and listen  that's all  I gotta try that  though  at a party  I gotta just 
[02:15:00]  talk  I'll probably  just get thrown  out like a nut  though  he can pull  it off  you know  what's weird  and if they  are listening  right now  as they go  to Jersey  for the show  tonight  did we give  out all the  tickets  I hope so  we gave out  all the tickets  for the show  tonight  alright cool  and this is a  compliment  if Perry's  listening right  now  if Perry was  on the subway  sitting next to  you and you  didn't know  it was Perry  and he was  talking like  he did  in the studio  you would  get up  and go to  another subway  car  right  you would  he'd be like 
[02:15:30]  that guy  that's talking  and you'd go  uh oh  uh oh  I gotta get  another seat  any other place  that guy would  be homeless  you know what  I gotta start  like a little  kooky  I gotta start  I gotta start  paying more  attention to the  homeless  people out  there  maybe they're  rock stars  sitting in  those seats  I think  they're on  to something  Ziggy is a  genius  we just  don't know  it  that  um  that hydrogen  thing  I was like  what  what  what's  hydrogen  but it's  escaping the  atmosphere  so we have  to uh  do we 
[02:16:00]  do we have  to farm it  because hydrogen's  not dangerous  but then you  know for  for burning  as far as  exhaust goes  but I saw  that Hindenburg  thing  that was full  of hydrogen  that looked  dangerous to me  it blew up  like crazy  hydrogen  very very  flammable  and I know  they're listening  right now  going ha ha ha  you're just  mere mortals  silly you  if you  infuse it  with a  right  oh okay  Perry could  not have  found  bigger  retards  to try  to explain  this  I know  just watching 
[02:16:30]  you guys  struggle  with just  the elements  that there  are elements  elephants  elephants  and he thought  we were making  fun of him  I was  completely  enthralled  fascinated  I could sit  here and listen  to him all  day  all day  Anthony  I just had  this visual  that in  between gigs  like Anne  said  that Perry  Farrell  is in  like a  space suit  trying to  farm  like hydrogen  because it's  escaping  from our  atmosphere  they were  cool guys  they rocked  this guy  Anthony  says that  spending  fee grand  in terms of 
[02:17:00]  college on  his master's  degree was  meaningless  because everyone  knows that  there are  three elements  helium hydrogen  and oxygen  you don't see  me trying to  play guitar  or work a  radio transmission  and then we  asked those guys  if they're afraid  to fly  and Jeff  writes  there's so  many hilarious  instant feedback  Jeff writes  of course  Perry isn't  afraid to fly  he's flying  right now  see that's  the whole  thing though  that that  image  and the way  you talk  if you're  a rock  star like  that 
[02:17:30]  that I  just don't  get  and whenever  you're backstage  in the show  and you're  getting like  that  how close  were you  listening  half the  stuff Perry  said was  based on  fact  well fine  the whole  mineral thing  oh look  yeah that  was based  on fact  the fact  that yeah  minerals  have certain  signatures  that can be  translated  and stuff  fine  but then  he's sending  those out  to aliens  hello  you know  scientists  have  that's not  as crazy  as you think  scientists  sent out  a gold 
[02:18:00]  record  many years  ago  with a record  player  did they send  a record  player  yeah there  was a way  to play  it  well that  would be  silly  sending out  a record  without a  record  player  hello  in X  amount  of languages  in case  aliens  ever found  it  and there  was a  drawing  of a man  and a  woman  and where  we positioned  in the  universe  and the  solar system  so right  now  some aliens  enjoying  ABBA  no they're  not  because I  think in  one of the  Star Trek  movies  a Klingon  used it  for target  practice  blew it up  thank you 
[02:18:30]  that's the  kind of  image  though  that  tell me  you wouldn't  want to  get high  with those  guys  they would  freak you  out  so bad  I couldn't  keep up  by the end  of the night  you'd be in a  corner crying  for your  mommy  they would  come up  with crap  that'd be  like cut it  out  stop  I couldn't  picture those  guys in the  studio  I couldn't  picture them  in the studio  I've been in  bands  and I've  worked with  some musicians  and being in  the studio 
[02:19:00]  and I just  imagine asking  Perry something  and just  woo  something coming  out  is this having  to do with  our recording  session  and I did  and Stephen  was giggling  behind Perry  oh I know  and I was like  you know  a couple of  those guys  thank god  there's one  guy I can  relate to  man  I see  Dave just  going like  yeah man  Perry's cool  man  right  but a couple  of them guys  just like  alright man  look  alright  Perry's  going off  again  that was  so cool  having him  in  that was  fun  hey Bill 
[02:19:30]  what's up  hey  you know  there was  a movie  a couple  years ago  that was  based on  Perry's  life  and I  can't  remember  the name  of it  but  at one  scene  it was  his girlfriend  or wife  died of a  heroin overdose  and he  goes and  he screws  the dead  rigor mortising  corpse  and I can't  remember the  name of it  but I just  want to tell  you guys  about it  and I wish  I got  over Perry  thanks for  calling  now  well  you know  I was  trying to  get  the whole  time  because  the guys  are one  of my  favorite  fans  but I  wish I  got 
[02:20:00]  through  before  alright  you guys  got any  tickets by  any chance  still  we gave  away all  the Jane's  addiction tickets  for tonight's show  in Jersey  there  that's a shame  alright guys  thanks a lot  alright  bye  so  I'm just  glad I have  nothing to  plug tonight  you know  how embarrassing  it would be  competing with  Jane's addiction  and having one  person show up  at my dumb  performance  Mike what's  going on  what's up  man  the problem  with the  abduction is  you can't  turn to your  buddy  and go  I'm having

[02:21:00]  just  started  look man  we just  had fun  for the  last hour  but we're  bringing the  show back  to earth  seriously  one of the  reoccurring  things is  missing time  they couldn't  figure out  why the  fire was  out  they put  the fire  in  they got  in the  canoe  the next  thing  you know  the fire  is out  Mike  it's time  for a  re-entry  I'm going  to make  a joke  I'm going  to make  a joke  though  you've  got to  listen  alright  I actually  this is  true  I had  an  experience  where  there  was  big  guys  putting  things  in  my  A  I woke  up  with  a  rod  so you're 
[02:21:30]  saying you  enjoyed it  delicious  let's just  move on  with the  show  let's just  realize  we're  not cool  we stink  our lives  are boring  we really  are nerds  we are  such nerds  man  you should  see  people  listeners  can't  see  I got  a picture  with  those  guys  thank  you to  Rick  and you  should  just  see  four  cool  guys  and a  chubby  dyke  I look  like a  chubby  lesbian  a chubby dyke  you do  look like a 
[02:22:00]  chubby dyke  I sent a  picture of  myself  with  Sully  from  Godsmack  I met  him in  Boston  and I  sent a  picture  to  this  girl  who I  hadn't  met  and she  sent  back  and she  meant  that  she  said  are  you  a  lesbian  she  thought  they  will  be  on  my  website  when it  goes  up  chubby  carpet  muncher  four  cool  guys  and a  fat  dyke  I  stink  photo  taken  I'm very  happy  about that  I had to  sneak in  on his  shot 
[02:22:30]  then he  wouldn't  take a  shot  of me  when do  I ever  ask for  a photo  name it  never  that's  cool  props  to Ben  he set  up this  damn  thing  there were  all sorts  of rules  and they  had to  be  snuck  into  the  building  we should  talk  about  some  of  this  stuff  what  was  the  whole  deal  you  had  like  meet  them  behind  a  car  in  the  garage  first  of  all  they  called  and  they 
[02:23:00]  they  called  last  minute  and said  no  they  don't  want  red  bull  and  vodka  the  manager  is  like  Perry's  not  drinking  any  red  bull  and vodka  before  we go  so get 
[02:23:30]  him a  bottle  of  white  wine  so John  runs out  and gets  some  bottle  of  white  wine  he  he  probably  gets  the  real  expensive  he  said  to me  let's  see the  bottle  wine  we have  some  white  wine  experts  out  there  they'll  tell us  exactly  what this  wine is  all about  it's cream  and ripple  I call it  cripple  Perry took a sip  and then looked at it and I like  hey man I thought we were on a good show  you guys are on in 15 cities  no he was cool  he was definitely cool  because I said I saw you last night on the small stage you were drinking a red bull and vodka 
[02:24:00]  and he's like yeah you know  alright we really need a wine expert to call in and tell us  that's got a cork  that's good  oh my god  where the hell did you get this  what is that  you took this out of a homeless guy's hand  what kind of white trash wine is that  what the hell is it  Del Ronco  Boone's Farm  what  it's a Sauvignon  hey wait a second  just to defend John for a second  I guarantee  none of you idiots in here could have picked out a better one than him  so  I would ask the guy at the counter  yes  he did  I told him to  didn't you  get my friend  good wine  I was told 
[02:24:30]  get something over 20 bucks  that's not a Chardonnay  over 20 bucks  over 20 bucks  wow we're rocking  this cost 21 bucks  I bet you  24  24  over 20  $4 more  let me say  it's a  Gelsso  Del Ronco  Gelsso  it looks like it might even be a 4  I don't know  here Ed  it's  it's  Italian  it's Italian  why don't you just bring back some Meisterbrow  oh god  the worst  yeah 
[02:25:00]  first of all  I wouldn't have gotten this  because the label looks weird  yeah  label alone  I would have went with a classier label  that  that's a label that says cheap  yeah  yeah  they're trying to make it look like it's not cheap  but it says cheap  good job John  imported by  Payne Bianco  can I give you at least 30 bucks  I had like 27  I had to get a bottle of wine  and I had to get ice  to keep it cold and everything  I was told to get two bags of ice  I grabbed the first one  blew it  our first chance to hang with real rock stars 
[02:25:30]  and we blow it  we don't even get them the right wine  who sent them out with 30  good thing you're not putting them up in hotels  it'll be sharing rooms  nice comeback  callback I should say  Joe what's up  hey guys  hey  listening to Perry's cycle babble  I kinda understood it  but I came to the conclusion  Perry is the Socrates of rock  Socrates  Socrates  getting Socrates  alright  yeah I see this as being cheap  well has anyone called in about the wine yet 
[02:26:00]  Kevin what's up  hey what's happening guys  hey  well you should have gotten them the box of wine  box of wine  but actually  the reason I was calling  I would have loved to heard  Perry Farrell sit down  and have a conversation  with Mike Tyson  hi  hydrogen  hi  hydrogen  Q-L-P-Y-Z  alright Kevin  take it easy  bye  phones have exploded  Ronco Del Gelso  it's Ronco  Ronco is  Pope Heel's pocket fisherman  Ronco  remember Ronco  yeah that old TV  Eric what's up  Ronco  hey guys  Ron Pope Heel 
[02:26:30]  I wanted to warn you  when these guys were in  just lock the doors  and call the cops  why  these guys sounded so weird  they sounded just like the intern  you remember the guy with the accident  with the fake eye  yeah  oh my god  a little  a little  they're  you know  didn't you get that feeling  when you were sitting with them  no  I mean you knew who they were  you know  I look forward to  reading about those guys  Dave Navarro  does great interviews  yeah  there was one recently  in Spinner  or something  that was unbelievable 
[02:27:00]  Perry Farrell  every time he's in  Rolling Stone or something  I can't get enough  rock stars are all  a little bit off  yeah  those guys are just wired  it just sounded weird  alright  alright guys  alright this guy knows about  wine hopefully  Hassan  yo  what's up  not a whole heck of a lot  Hassan  how do you know about wine  first of all  my  wife  ex-wife to be  whatever the heck you want to call her  is from Germany  and the whole family  has I don't know  how many  hundred acres 
[02:27:30]  of grape fields  they're all vintners  alright  how pathetic was the wine  we just gave  Perry  well I can't tell  the most expensive wine  around is an ice wine  and that stuff goes  for like a .35 liter bottle  for about $35  but it tastes like sugar water  to some people  so it's up to taste  some people like dry  some people like sweet  alright  slow down  I just want to know  about this  Gelsa  yeah we just want to know  about the wine  that Perry was drinking  that's it  what  what was it 
[02:28:00]  it is  Ronco  Ronco  Del Gelso  or Gelso  Del Ronco  no it says  Ronco Del Gelso  the label  how can you tell  is that a Chateau  is it aged on the truck  it is  Sauvignon  dry white wine  1998  alright Hassan  I got another expert on the line  I got to go to Randall  we got to get to the bottom of this  Randall what's up  how are you gentlemen  how do you know about wine  the wine that you have  is basically the grapes  that fall on the floor 
[02:28:30]  and rot  and they squeeze it out  later to drink  if you want to impress somebody  a nice bottle of  Caymus white  yeah  or a bottle of  Opus Merlot  how much  Opus Merlot  running about $250  Caymus white  about $85  yeah exactly  see there you go  we should have been spending  if you get a  Caymus white  you'd enjoy it  do you know this wine  in particular Randall  no I never tried it  but I would know it  if it was anything  see what scares me  it was 24 bucks  Ant  and we're talking 
[02:29:00]  New York City prices  yeah  so it's probably  a $14 bottle of wine  well you know how you knew  he was going to blow it  because on the back of his shirt  John has Irish  Irish pubs of Ireland  that you don't send  a hillbilly  in an Irish pubs t-shirt  to buy fine wine  for a rock star  you don't do that  go to a nice steakhouse  buy yourself a bottle  of Opus One  enjoy it  let it breathe a little bit  for 15-20 minutes  you'll have a great night  alright Randall 
[02:29:30]  have a great day  another indication  that the wine  just flat out stunk  he left it behind  man  he left it  it was in the fridge  he didn't  there's barely  any taken out of it  it just  he had a few sips  to be polite  if he liked the wine  it would have been  hey you know  can I have some more  I'll take that with me  something  but you know  it's  whatever  you can travel  3 million light years  but you can't put  a fat guy in a canoe  that's what the twins saw  so don't feel too safe  thank you  or you should feel safer 
[02:30:00]  he had to get his  punchline into his bad joke  alright  Jay  last call on the wine  I gotta say  I gotta say  most of these guys  are idiots man  the first thing you need  is a Grand Cru  which means  the best press  out of white wine  alright  and the best wine you need  is a white  Burgundy  if he's wanting  some light  alright  Jay  Jay  help us out 
[02:30:30]  alright  we don't want to  talk about wines  it's going to bore people  we just want to know  how cheap the wine was  that we got  no one even has  heard of this wine  well  my family's all  from Scotland  and it could be  like buck fast wine  which is  cheap ass  like 19  like  what is that  what's the wine's  simple question  it's going to take  20 minutes to get the answer  I just need like  a liquor store guy  to go  it's the rack  crap  garbage  can we talk more  about this  I'd like to get  Mario Cantone 
[02:31:00]  on my lap  and discuss wine  Diana  what's up  Diana  hey guys  let's change the subject  how are you today  alright  how are you  good  James was cool  yeah we had fun  with them  that's the best show  so far  from your Philly syndicate  alright  coming down to Philly  tomorrow  I wanted to know  if I could come to the studio  and wow you guys  with my beautiful  pierced nipples  nice  wow  tomorrow  yeah  hell yeah  you know where  WISP is  yeah  I just wanted to know  if I can come to the studio  of course you can

[02:39:30]  let's take a break  awful  hey what's this  super fresh thing  is it short  four minutes  yeah we could  Caliendo  we haven't given them  any entertainment  for their dollar  this break  bang for their buck  are you saying  they haven't given them  any bang for their buck  this break  so  hey our buddy  Frank Caliendo  is in  and he's hilarious  and he did this whole  super friends thing  and we'll replay it 
[02:40:00]  as we go to break  how's that sound  okay  all right  all right  you know the commercials  were playing  and Frank and I  were talking about  Ted Knight  and he's like  why is the Ted Knight  you know funny  because the dueling  Ted Knight thing  that you and Frank did  people love that  so much  I don't like  there's something  about Ted Knight  even when he was  trying not to be funny  whatever he said  was funny  I'll find myself  a new greenskeeper  is that clear  anthrax is terrible  it really is  don't let the spores  get on you 
[02:40:30]  don't breathe them in  the problem I have  is halfway through a breath  in this laugh  I breathe them in  my eyes are bleeding  felt like I let you find  I want them cleaned  and buffed  with a fine jammy  chop chop  yes sir  yes sir  why you son of a bitch  Spalding  I'll let you have  the golf course  in five minutes  chop chop 
[02:41:00]  you're playing golf  today  Jackie  Sarah  Monroe  Mr. Ross  Monroe  shut up  Mary  we've just gone  through every  generation  meanwhile  back at the  Hall of Justice  that's right  he was that  Superman prepares  with Superdog  and Aquaman  Aquaman 
[02:41:30]  who's played by  Brian Regan  oh no  something went off  in a volcano  there's a volcano  going off  all I can do  is swim fast  I'm a swimmer  I got green gloves  but there's nothing  I can do  with magma  and lava  Aquaman covers  75% of the earth  he can patrol  yet all the crime  takes place  on the 25%  of land  oh if there was  a giant fish  attacking you  I would be able  to save you  unfortunately  this project  takes place  on land  calling the animals  of the sea 
[02:42:00]  they could do  nothing  like he could  whip up everyone  the sharks  and the sailfish  using his telepathic powers  Aquaman summons  a can of fish  a lot of good  this will do  for the villain  in Wisconsin  Charlie Tuna  unable to help him  on the swamp  damn it Aquaman sucks  meanwhile  somewhere on the road  a man listening  to the Opian Anthony show  goes off  to the side 
[02:42:30]  meanwhile  somewhere  in Opi's brain  nothing's happening  what would Brian Regan  sound like  if he was  over there  in Afghanistan  kind of trying  to find out  oh goodness  kind of look  oh my god  trying to think  of something  couldn't think  of anything  that was PC  enough  trying to think  of something  politically correct  to say about  Afghanistan  hey maybe  that's not  going to work  either  trying to think  of something 
[02:43:00]  somebody  bail  me out  of here  where's the  superhero's music  somewhere in another  part of the program  Frank's still doing  John Madden  and then this is  funnier  and then there were  little people  and they're putting  one foot in front  of the other  and the burger  meister meister burger  and the joke  Frank was doing  that wasn't working  got no idea  what I was talking  okay so they're  over there  play the thing 
[02:43:30]  again  get me out of it  a song for me  a song for you  let's have a song  I like baboon  meanwhile  another voice  in Frank's head  I don't know  what's going on here  I don't understand  why everybody's  gotta be looking  at me like this  this doesn't make  sense at all  I don't see  in another part  of Frank's brain  meanwhile 
[02:44:00]  in another bit  we're trying to find  a new Seinfeld bit  we don't have one  oh we can find one  all right  we're gonna have one  we're gonna have it  hello Jerry  hello Newman  meanwhile  Frank's trying to  catch up with  what he was doing  here's a guy  you can't remember  what bit he was  going to do  at that point  and then you go  and then meanwhile  I've never been  waiting for you  this time  I'm back in a song  I was singing before  and I'm enjoying  myself 150%  even though you 
[02:44:30]  can only go  about 100  he's gonna be okay  meanwhile  back with  Opie and Anthony  Frank Caliendo  see it wasn't that easy  New York Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  are now on the air  welcome to the  wonderful world  of Balloon Not Pleasure  yeah excuse me  Lube you're a loser  take it like a champ  okay  the Opie and Anthony  show  spreading like AIDS  in Haiti  and we're back  with the Opie and  Anthony show  for a few minutes 
[02:45:00]  yeah  and we gotta go get  some sleep in us  busy day tomorrow  oh yeah  going on a little  field trip  it is a field trip  and we didn't even  need permission slips  my mommy signed mine  like the olden days  you're going to the  museum of natural  history  get your permission  slip signed  and bring your  bag lunch  I can't wait to see  Tim Sabian's office  yeah we're gonna have  to see that 
[02:45:30]  the program director  of WISP in Philly  what do you think it is  the fun hip guy office  or is it the stuffy  Ken Stevens like office  that we have here  this will be a little  or the meticulously kept  Jeremy Coleman office  this will be a little  inside but there's  some radio people  that enjoy the show  yeah  I do believe  Tim will have  a R&R article  that he was featured  in  oh you think so  framed  framed up on the wall  oh that's good  alright  the one time he was  in R&R  where they had 
[02:46:00]  an exclusive interview  with Tim Sabian  the brain trust  behind WISP  in Philly  you notice our office  he will have  a little  an old radio  kind of on  oh you think  an old  or an old microphone  an old radio microphone  something like that  he'll have  hundreds of CDs  that he never  listens to  why doesn't he  just take them  to music stores  and sell them  in the secret room  well Anthony  they don't have  a secret room  at WISP in Philly  they have one 
[02:46:30]  at BCN  yes they do  the secret room  what a tool  I love that gag  alright  we say stuff  just to crack us up  I'm sorry  yeah  like our office  is nice and fun  and there's things  going on all the time  Jeremy's office  you can tell  you're in management's office  but at least  there's a couple  of things  you know  he's got some  of those little puzzles  you know  you gotta like  the little  get the thing  put back together  again puzzle 
[02:47:00]  something like that  but Ken's office  is just like  devoid of fun  well Ken just  calls it in  there's no  right right  yeah that's  that's just like  he just comes up  here you know  for a couple days  every week  to make sure  we didn't  blow up the place  that's like  someone's summer  house  there is nothing  in his office  yeah  it's a timeshare  that makes me think  that he enjoys  his time in New York  he should just  timeshare it out  where other people  from other companies  can hey I'm here  today too  why not  I'll use your office  he still has  the anal couch  in his office 
[02:47:30]  yeah  that shows you  a lot right there  yeah he's got  the old  Gary Wall round table  that was featured  in Richard Neer's  book right  I got him  binoculars  so he could  democratic round table  I got him a pair  of binoculars  so he could check  out the chicks  changing  over at the dance  school  across the way  but instead  he's using them  trying to read  Jeremy's writing  kind of so inside  but it's funny  I know  he writes very tiny  our program director  here in New York  yeah  he yeah 
[02:48:00]  the regular loose leaf  most people  you know  one line  per one line  you can write  the letters  are as high  as the space  or maybe half  the space  if they're lowercase  he can put  four lines  within that space  and that's how  he writes  and his office  looks like something  out of clockwork  orange  it's just weird  and neat  and not a speck  out of place  yes  very stark  a lot of emotional  problems  but then Ken's  office is just  this unfun  you're in trouble  or you're arguing 
[02:48:30]  for something  in there  and the room  just reeks of it  of just argument  he has the best office  and he doesn't even  take advantage of it  corner office  corner office  tons of windows  yeah  great view of the chicks  changing  or sunbathing  topless on some  of these buildings  around here  doesn't take advantage  of none of that  nothing  let's play  what did we learn  on the ONA show  today huh  yes  Dennis what's going on  what's going on boys  I learned a couple  things today  I learned Norton  looks like a chubby dyke  chubby dyke  and I learned good ratings

[02:50:00]  of anthrax  so  hey  how you doing  that's a little  odd isn't it  what nationality  does it say  Arizmendi  I don't know  what that is  I think that's  Irish  yeah it sounds  but if  he does have  some kind of  anthrax  wow  you know  did he get it there  or is he the guy  that's been spreading  it around  and maybe came back  to bite him  in the ass  we don't want to  profile anybody  though guys  stories developing  let's go to
