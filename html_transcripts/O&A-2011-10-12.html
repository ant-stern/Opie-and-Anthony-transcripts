<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show began with a discussion of heavily photoshopped pictures of Lindsay Lohan in Playboy, prompting crude and sexually explicit commentary from Opie, Anthony, Danny, and Jim.  This transitioned into an enthusiastic, albeit hyperbolic, recap of the Denver Broncos' surprising victory over the Chicago Bears, largely attributed to Tim Tebow's performance.  Listeners called in to share their opinions on Tebow, his perceived "miraculous" abilities, and the game's key moments, including Marion Barber's controversial run and Matt Prater's long field goals.

The show then digressed into several tangents, including a listener's previous overly enthusiastic call, the hosts' disdain for Mika Brzezinski, Opie's frustrations with Time Warner Cable, a negative movie-going experience with his son, a critical assessment of "New Year's Eve,"  a jab at Ashton Kutcher's perceived lack of self-awareness, and numerous anecdotes about past interns, especially "Intern Jared" and his infamous "Big Boy Makes a Duty" stunt involving feces. Opie also shared a story about a severe case of diarrhea requiring a hasty bathroom break.

A heated confrontation with a caller, Jordan K, dominated a significant portion. Jordan K, who considered himself part of the show, had tweeted offensive insults about Anthony, leading to a furious and extremely vulgar tirade from Anthony filled with homophobic slurs and personal attacks on Jordan K, his family, and his intelligence.  Uncle Paul, described as an "old guy" with a "creepy stare," made a brief, potentially inappropriate contribution, followed by a promotion for Uncle Nino's stand-up show featuring "adolescent toilet humor."  The segment also included discussion of Tim Tebow's post-game thank you to Jesus, which irritated the hosts, and a brief call from Israel. The insults toward Jordan K and the discussion of blocking Twitter followers continued throughout this segment.

Later, the show shifted to a discussion on religious attire, followed by criticism of Reverend Al Sharpton's IRS debt and a surprisingly positive review of a blueberry pie commercial featuring him. This transitioned into an in-depth analysis of UFC fights, particularly Jon Jones's match, and the firing of Miguel Torres.  The hosts also discussed the experiences of intern Matt at FH Riley's, including a detailed, sexually explicit account of a threesome.

Another segment focused on a lingerie calendar, Opie's assessment of the models, and a bizarre conversation with one of the calendar girls. This led to humorous, slightly offensive comments about Jimmy's departure and his upcoming comedy shows, followed by mockery of Chris Humphreys's appearance on Good Morning America after his short-lived marriage to Kim Kardashian.  A lengthy debate about Pearl Jam, particularly Eddie Vedder's ukulele album and a music video, ensued with a caller known as "Coke Logic." The segment concluded with an advertisement for a Christmas party at a topless club, a complaint about a song being ruined by the hosts, and a heated argument between interns Sal and Matt, fueled by Sal's anger and jealousy. E-Rock made a brief appearance at the end.  The show featured "Hard Son" by Eddie Vedder.

The final segment detailed another graphic account from intern Matt, this time about a sexual encounter with two women he met at a bar, including a former Hooters waitress.  This led to a ranking of past interns, including Pat Duffy, Intern David, and Jared "Cream Pie Jones," with Pat Duffy calling in to share anecdotes.  The segment concluded with an advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers and brief commentary from Dr. Gay.

[00:04:00]  O.P. and Anthony show.  fuck attractive girls and little jimmy i don't even like an r-opening it sounds like a little  stop with that shit i know here they are why why am i introducing these buffoons i'm with  him shatner god damn it but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  fuck yeah i agree 
[00:04:30]  morning everyone hi how's everyone doing danny had a good take on the lindsey lohan picks yeah we're  gonna get into this today oops sorry and uh i'm gonna call out a bunch of dopes on twitter because  they're like oh i'd still do her yeah yeah the problem with the lindsey lohan pictures if you  haven't seen them yet she's supposed to be i think 27 28 she looks like she's in her 40s they  photoshopped the shit out of her did they because she's uh ravaged and and in one picture her wig 
[00:05:00]  is on crooked and then you got people on twitter well what's wrong with you i'd still do her my  point is that's not lindsey lohan yeah if you saw her without the photoshop and everything else and  without the marilyn monroe sort of vibe you would you would fucking puke all right i'll be the judge  of this i think jimmy thought the pictures were hot most people are thinking sense what the fuck  man these lindsey lohan pictures should be a lot better than they are how was that right danny and 
[00:05:30]  what what were you just saying well i mean when i saw him uh on friday you know they were nice it  was a woman and there was breasts and a body yeah of course all that shit is nice it didn't really  look like lindsey lohan's right and you know if i want to beat off to lindsey lohan i'd much rather pull  up some paparazzi shots of her on the beach in a bikini because at least it looks like her and i  know what i'm beating off to this just look like some blonde airbrush chick that could be anybody  and the pictures you're talking about you know those are pictures before you know the party and  got the best of her yeah look at this that's her right there let's say okay i mean danny nailed it 
[00:06:00]  yeah it's a naked girl she's got big boobies yeah all that's fine but we're talking about lindsey  lohan look at that let me see that is photoshopped okay the uh the big the big uh heavy jugs right  are all right with the fucking nipples that are uh fading away quickly well yeah she's got uh well  she's got that whole red freckley thing she's got very light nipples she's covered in freckles too  well like sprinkles on an ice cream well you couldn't tell because they photoshopped all that away 
[00:06:30]  that and all the scum they overexpose it too where all the white spots get really kind of  light is that what's going on a little overexposure yeah yeah so to the the guys going i'd still do or  okay fine but this you're not looking at at pictures that represent her at all no no the guy  should win some kind of special effects award for the photoshopping because that's they got rid of a  lot of stuff i feel gypped you know yeah i wanted to see lindsey lohan and that's not what i got 
[00:07:00]  here oh what a jip that's right though it's overexposed so the whole thing looks a little  too like white washed out yeah that's a good way to get rid of imperfections exactly remember those  pictures she did in the new yorker like three years ago yeah those those are way better way better yeah  yeah and they left a little uh lindsey lohan in the pictures they decided to not photoshop everything  they took these uh and just fucking yeah look at that really way better that's in the new yorker  yeah those were in the new yorker in 2008 and look at her arm and chavis what do you think of 
[00:07:30]  the pictures just like danny danny and i were looking at them you know together oh yeah you  know we're mutually masturbating once upon another yes i like that you heard the stories about what  happens after hours here uh but no the same thing it's like who cares i see her you're grabbing  balls these days yes nice change yes thank you i just get mad at dummies that go i'd still do  or you're but you're not looking at actual pictures of lindsey lohan uh yeah of course i would much 
[00:08:00]  rather beat off to this this picture of lindsey lohan it's just her in a green bikini with like just  some shirt that's open like i would much rather and and it's not photoshopped it's not like ann said  it's uh what washed out yeah it looks like her she's got red hair like how you would expect her to  look exactly right i like the uh what they call the uh freaky friday pictures now those i could jerk  all right i have to be outrageous um and she looks a lot older in these playboy pictures 
[00:08:30]  doesn't she she doesn't look like a woman in her 20s and why the marilyn monroe thing well  she's trying to class with marilyn monroe i think that's an effort to try to class it up you know  what i mean oh so she doesn't so she doesn't uh feel like she's desperately doing this because yeah  because no one else will hire her no one's paying attention to her you know what else it is her if  you want to call it muscle tone and skin when she lays down everything kind of falls a little bit  like a sharp a yeah her skin is kind of yeah it's very elastic-y i would love to see the original 
[00:09:00]  photos oh i bet it's a wreck oh they'll come out no no because hugh hefner made her reshoot the  entire thing so all those so there's a set that was worse than this i'm wondering if this is the set  he wasn't happy with because these are leaked right that he wanted no this is the set he wanted  okay it's gonna come all right sure fine sure sure all right all right all right all right sir  all right sir but she uh she's she's doing that marilyn monroe thing i don't know i'm not fucking 
[00:09:30]  i wasn't feeling the marilyn marilyn thing but i mean to the people saying i would you know i'd still  do her well of course you're obligated but you would have to go into some weird photoshop world  to get that girl yeah that's that's why i was frustrated by that mike do you understand what  they did to make her presentable yeah whatever good for her why are we talking about that when we  when we have uh uh the the son of god playing football what the son of god jesus himself 
[00:10:00]  jesus oh yeah turn this up who knew the new place uh the holy land the new holy land is denver  colorado that's right that's it what are they calling him the the three mile high messiah or  something like that travis what's his new nickname every mile high messiah it's jesus he could be three  miles high because he could probably hover two miles more over denver i do believe you're right 
[00:10:30]  on that yeah three mile high three mile island i was thinking maybe three mile island it's early  you're right yeah but i was telling that before the show we're gonna do a deja vu thing yeah didn't  we just do this break last monday deja vu all over again  and thank god we don't have a woman on this show to fucking ruin it we're watching msnbc this uh mika  miko whatever the hell her name is the the boys were having a fine discussion about tebow time 
[00:11:00]  and this miracle that he pulled off and the broncos pulled off obviously and she's like all right well  you know there was so much happening in politics let's talk about the president are you guys done  with your silly fucking football thing so she could try to spin the fact that obama's got 54 of the  people saying they wouldn't vote for him yeah uh and he's not doing a good job but she wanted to get  right to that oh boy did she she didn't want to try to spin that around it could convert the people  she didn't want to let the guys just have a little uh discussion on the football how ridiculous this 
[00:11:30]  broncos game was yesterday right tim tebow and the denver broncos i almost want to watch them more than  my new york jets at this point well you know uh with an exciting a miraculous finish uh that really  just you know i bet a bunch of people just shut the game off well the if you i mean everyone knows  by now so i guess we don't have to give too many details but tim tebow and the broncos they're down  10 nothing with a little over two minutes left and uh you know broncos score but the problem is 
[00:12:00]  the broncos have no timeouts left and the bears all they have to do is run out the clock yeah all  they have to do is uh do three three running plays and that's it it's over that little wacky thing where  they just kind of yeah they uh no passing you run you eat up the clock you take a lot of time in  between right setting up and everything this is why this is a miracle they won a game that was  impossible to win as long as the bears did you know basic football shit yeah and then marion barber 
[00:12:30]  fucking runs out of bounds whoops he starts running toward the sidelines and and and he's got to be  smart enough to to realize you got to stay in bounds keep that clock rock allowing the broncos  to pretty much push him out stopping the clock now that's going to guarantee as long as the defense  does its thing where the broncos are going to get the ball back yeah do you think marion barber  believes no marion barber does not believe in jesus jesus you don't have to believe in jesus to believe 
[00:13:00]  in tim tebow see the problem is marion barber doesn't believe in jesus and tim tebow does i i think  marion barber is uh muslim matter of fact some people are telling me last night so then wins  that battle travis the broncos get the ball back with how much time uh 50 seconds 50 seconds and  they're deep in their own end yeah oh yeah they're on like it's hot uh what are they on like the 10 or  something like that and then fucking tebow who's had a shitty game once again up until tebow time 
[00:13:30]  marches up the fucking field and gets him where uh pratter could attempt a 59 year old field goal  59 yard field goal this is how insane this game was that's uh that's a hell of a fucking uh  field goal and then pratter steps up and kicks a 59 year old uh 59 59 year old field goal a 59 yard  field goal yes and one of the dopes on fox uh fox and friends like oh you see how surprised he was 
[00:14:00]  pratter let me tell you something about pratter you dope on fox news the blonde guy uh pratter wasn't  surprised at all the guy knows he could kick that fucking far yeah they showed if you watch the game  at all that he in practice he hit a 70 yard field goal just to show you what he could do well that's  pretty good but obviously in a game situation you got to get it over the line and all that blah blah  blah but pratter knew that he could kick it 59 yards it was uh it was pretty cool to watch because uh  you did not see the team no you didn't see the teams they showed the uh they showed the uprights 
[00:14:30]  yeah and a lot of field yeah and then somewhere at the bottom of your television set the team might  have been down there you might have saw a helmet and by the way the 59 yarder there was plenty of  room yeah it wasn't like it just squeaked through the uprights probably could have done another three  or four yards easy so then they go to overtime and the bears march down the field uh-oh and now  the bears are in field goal territory certainly at that point right travis and then here yeah they 
[00:15:00]  should have made it and then here comes marion barber again he fumbles the fucking ball he gets  he gets stripped actually whoops allowing the broncos to get the ball back and then they march  back down the field and then pratter steps back on the field and kicks a 51 yarder and there you go  tebow fucking wins again jesus over allah dude yes but it was this they weren't supposed to win this  one well they did if you're watching the game at one point the announcers they just start openly  laughing like uh what uh we don't know what to say let's talk about other things that wasn't 
[00:15:30]  supposed to happen opie jesus wasn't supposed to walk on water true jesus wasn't supposed to cure the  lepers true jesus wasn't supposed to feed uh like a lot of people with just you know fish true how  about wine into uh blood into wine how about uh uh body into bread true you know these are things and  tebow time is now the the latest uh incarnation of jesus miracles right and and and a lot of people  i love this they're trying to well fine let's go to albuquerque no one's gonna listen to you 
[00:16:00]  a long drive go ahead dave oh you know what i'm a huge broncos fan have been all my life  um not a jesus fan by any means oh damn you literally um but you know what this guy's winning  games although mary and barber kind of won that game for us yesterday that guy that guy shouldn't  have run out of bounds see you're you're you're you're thinking like a mere mortal right tim tebow had 
[00:16:30]  everything to do with that because he believes in jesus that's what you don't understand things are  happening around this guy that aren't supposed to happen that's what happens tell me about it you  don't have to explain it to me man i'm a broncos fan and i can't stand the guy and and and this  whole jesus thing but you know what at the end i'm like how does he won the game who cares how does  how do they get two lucky breaks like that where mary and barber doesn't keep his stay in bounds and 
[00:17:00]  then during the overtime he gets stripped that's some jesus shit how does the team win because the  other team oh you just talk that's right jimmy jimmy wants to say his first words of the show and  and you trounced upon him he didn't know go ahead all right dave thank you they just showed uh the  70 yarder in in practice too by the way people were um very elated huh people very elated there  in denver because they weren't supposed to win this one to be quite honest with you i mean the other ones 
[00:17:30]  they probably weren't supposed to win i don't know what the fuck's going on supposed to win their  last six games yeah exactly i know tebow had a shitty three quarters again he always does it's  always three pieces of shit and then twitter all sudden trending topic tebow time you're like okay  no fucking way is this gonna happen again and it happens again you hear my excitement i'm way  more excited about this shit than the jets who jets game was boring though the game was just  they were pretty much uh that game was pretty much over after the first i don't know quarter 
[00:18:00]  basically yeah it was a boring game i walked around because what else was i gonna do you want to you  want to hear some tebow clips who doesn't can we actually capture these on like cds his voice i  sure i thought it came out of a burning bush and turned your hair white you watch this game jimmy  fuck this game and fuck tebow i'm so disgusted with football i can't even express oh shit what  happened how fucking livid the last night's game i was i watched it you did watch yeah like the last 
[00:18:30]  half with it from the first i was gonna get into that as the second game there's only two games in  disgust today basically fucking just so every time i'm just hearing all these clips and i'm just i'm so  fucking livid football livid i don't think romo goes to church brother it ain't even romo's fault it's  just it's just the team stinks terribly coached how do you allow the giants to march down and  because they stink that's how when you stink that's what happens i couldn't sleep oh jesus i thought 
[00:19:00]  you weren't a football fan anymore what happened that's why that's why i can't do it i can't do  this you weren't a football fan for the entire year and then like i think if i remember correctly  the last couple weeks jimmy's been hinting like oh i can't not watch my team it just gets them all  pissed off dallas giants you can't not watch that when you're home it's like i'm writing something you  can't not watch dallas giants they blew a 12 point uh fourth quarter lead five and a half minutes  left and lost uh 37 to 34 yeah another field goal that was kicked at the buzzer yeah that had to be 
[00:19:30]  re-kicked because of a timeout yeah that's two weeks in a row who who's the cowboys uh kicker dan  bailey i think he's a fucking rookie and it wasn't even his fault it was just one of those things where  you get blocked whenever a kick gets blocked it's not the kicker's fault it's the fucking  offensive line yeah he uh he tied the game technically not technically i guess yeah to  send it to overtime but it didn't count because the giants called a timeout in time this has  happened to the guy twice in two weeks in two weeks oh but last week it was his own coach right 
[00:20:00]  it was his own coach that froze him it shouldn't have come to that so the defense was shit but fuck  the giants too the giants are shit too i hate all you giant fans that are happy fuck you oh the  giants don't have a fucking they have no shot they don't have a shot at this shit sorry fucking  hate the giants always have always will oh bad uh bad a bad night for football it was terrible dude  it was really i was literally laying in bed really pissed off i thought it was something else no no i  woke up uh cranky and then i just walk in i see football clips i'm like oh so i literally i was 
[00:20:30]  in bed for fucking 90 minutes maybe just awake really yeah and you didn't sleep like a lot  the night before that's why you were up no no you just were no no no i turned the game off after  it was over and i'm like this is why i don't fucking watch this is why i don't do it yeah but  that that's the chance you take when you like follow a team i know they could fucking break your  heart i know they could break your heart uh let's say hi to john in gainesville hey good morning guys

[00:22:00]  tebow's doing it's like a it's like a poster i i read once op it was called cleat prince on the field  and some of the players were wondering yeah why during the toughest times of the game  did tebow leave that right but i mean if you look at his stats they're shitty yeah but he's winning  these games and that's everyone is stepping up around him because they just believe in this guy 
[00:22:30]  because he's so motivated fuck one more one more call from uh jim on long island no one is dying  hey guys yeah uh i bartended at a sports bar uh out here in hicksville and i go radio show  and yeah well you know and uh everyone was gearing up for for the giants and and then the cowboys and  like a couple of stragglers left over for the jets game but but like the whole tebow thing everyone  was watching the the the denver game and it turned into it turned into like everyone was rooting for

[00:29:00]  he was featured on a jocktober oh that that had a little side business going at geneseo where oh  boy he was fucking he was setting everybody up with cable i mean everybody well the old days that  was old school it was easy the old days uh i'd go down to a radio shack yeah get uh some heavy  coaxial cable right big spools of it and then uh climb the uh pole across the street from my house  and then just run it uh to my window and uh there it is you got your cable you got to take the 
[00:29:30]  little filter off but you could do that with two skinny screwdrivers how do you know you weren't  going to get electrocuted because i wasn't by the power part of it i was by the cable but most  people don't even know that power lines are higher up on the pole like the cable and telephone are  down low right so you you just you know and you know you see the coaxial cables actually run wire  across street across the street because we used to just you know it was these houses where there  was 10 apartments in one house no i'd have to run it saw who had cable and then you fucking did 
[00:30:00]  your thing well the reason i had to run a new cable is because the cable guys came and actually  cut the cable one day they cut it didn't even remove it they cut it where it was swinging over  the street like here asshole we know what you're doing stop it and i just i went right there and ran  a new line and how long did that one last it lasted a while they weren't coming there every day like  fucking bullies they weren't cable bullies but uh they knew they knew what was going on right  it's amazing how bad tv looks when you look at hd like you watch the game and you go to regular 
[00:30:30]  oh my god oh my god i don't think i watch any tv is regular tv worse than it used to be though or is  it just we know to see how good it's digital now you just see how great uh hd is i do not watch  tv that isn't hd anymore like i go to my fios by the way let me just tell you how this works  i go on my remote and then i hit hd channels and only the hd channels show now so now i could scroll  down and dispense with the crappy standard definition channels and then i get you know 
[00:31:00]  fox hd all the because all the regular channels are in hd now and then they got the other ones for  some inane reason they're tying up fucking bandwidth with the shitty standard def channels that are  unnecessary right now right if you don't have hd right now there's a big problem because you can  get a television that's hd you could fucking get an hd antenna whatever the fuck how long ago are we  talking about tvs hanging on the wall like i can't believe that's gonna oh back in the 30s i know  when they said the communists were going to uh i thought it was more recently what it was yeah 
[00:31:30]  probably seven years ago like they just hangs on the wall it hangs on the wall it's amazing you  know i yep i uh it goes with the discussion i went to the movies this weekend i brought my son to  see the wall bits oh okay i thought you went to see new york's eve where the babysitter  no worst movie week since fucking 2008 i haven't been to the movies in a while and i know they love  their previews and their commercials and holy fuck and when you have a little kid in a theater the 
[00:32:00]  clock is is is ticking fucking movie time 4 35 the actual movie because i i fucking timed it  five oh five half hour it was a half fucking hour and i'm sitting there turned out my kid was he  he turned out to be cool through the whole thing you know we almost made it through the you don't  know it could be ticking time bomb it was ticking like he doesn't want to see a coca-cola commercial  let's go potato with a child it was a half hour 505 is when the muppets uh officially started 
[00:32:30]  wow there's a lot of kids when a kid's movie like that is there like is it expected that there's  going to be chatter during the movie and stuff just trying to know it wasn't bad at all you know i  thought my kid would be the problem because he was the youngest one in the whole damn thing  and he was he was fine he started acting up near the end and and know what i do know what i do as  a parent whether he's acting up let's get the fuck out of here hey that's what i did that's what i did  yeah that's all you have to do what are you acting up was he like crying or just no not even crying he 
[00:33:00]  was just starting to be he was he was bored fussy he's almost what is he what day is today oh he's 19  months old so you know he sat through about an hour and 40 half of that was a half hour that was  previews then we saw about an hour 10 of the movie i didn't need to see the whole movie i've seen the  muppets already i was just fucking on my uh phone the whole time it didn't matter i was just sitting  there and then he started fussing around and moving around too much and getting bored and started  looking around i'm like okay he doesn't need to see the end of this let's get the fuck out of here 
[00:33:30]  like what he saw though i could do he was paying attention yeah it's fucked up what kids know but  he can't really talk right uh he's having what they call a word explosion what's that we're all  out of your ass with chili but only words with your shit alphabet soup yeah we're all sudden just words  are popping out oh he's getting like like crazy but then he won't say those words ever again  i don't know it's really strange uh what was the point oh the point being that and we we've 
[00:34:00]  discussed this many times i'm sitting in this movie theater watching the muppets and the previews and  everything going this is a shitty experience oh movies are horrible it's archaic what are you going  like watching the previews and being forced to sit no just the quality of of uh what you're seeing  it's it's unbelievable to drop off at this point between your hd tv at home and what you uh see at  a movie theater unless you go to an imax do they have hd screens or is it only i i hear i hear they 
[00:34:30]  have technology but it's way too expensive to turn everything over so they have decided fucked up we'll  just continue with the old way it's it's bad the sound even even when the sounds good it's not as good  as you can get in your house for relatively you know you're going to be paying for surround sound  in your house yeah but that's most now yeah most people are getting all that stuff yeah they don't  have to be extremely rich to get a nice sound system and a halfway decent uh tv in your home now is 
[00:35:00]  imax better like i've been to imax movies just oh imax is better technically i don't know obviously  the screen is ridiculously big and maybe that's what makes it cooler i don't know do you not jealous i'm  gonna be gone tomorrow and be in la but there's a screening you guys can go to that fucking  mission impossible 3 imax oh i'm crying i'm not i'm i've been dying to see that movie for a year  and a half is that tomorrow i think so yeah tuesday yeah i'm gonna get to another one yeah  fucking miserable i'm gonna miss that oh boy well where are you gonna be jimmy i'm doing leto 
[00:35:30]  tomorrow but so i leave today oh but i'm crying yeah i'd rather do leto and you can and you  could go to mission impossible yeah right no other than it's a commercial i mean i'm of course  i'm happy i'm done i don't mean like i should cancel but i'm like i'm just fucking i would so  rather get on a plane and go to la than see mission impossible oh look at the fucking birch tower he's  jumping out the birch how do you not see that i hope that's not just one minute  i think that has a big uh what's that just be a dream he has in the movie and he jumps for a second 
[00:36:00]  he wakes up and it's a a love story yeah between him and another man yeah we're checking that shit  out tomorrow i hope uh i hope my son uh is gonna sit through mission impossible because i don't know  if i have a babysitter so i'm dragging his ass into the imax experience if i have to leave uh  mission impossible because he's getting fussy that that's not as easy as leaving the muppets  muppets is easy yeah well what were you talking about at the fucking um god a lot of fucking 
[00:36:30]  today a lot of crap i don't know what that happens it's monday you gotta get it out you've had a  whole weekend of not being able to curse is that what it is you weren't able to curse because you  have a kid so you can't blurt out profanity so you're getting it all out there you go the the  movies this weekend was a dud worse uh worst box office since i think 2008 god you listen to the  same fucking yes i know i get my little tidbits of uh information right september  2008 yeah the number one movie was new year's eve with 13.7 million and i don't even know how it 
[00:37:00]  made that much i didn't hear one good review on this fucking movie it's one of these ensemble huge  casts of celebrities and it's uh you know it definitely does not add up let's see who's in  there halle berry i hear she's in it for two seconds uh john bon jovi in any movie is great i hear he's  not too good as an actor in this one robert de niro jessica biel robert de niro i heard in a 
[00:37:30]  review he plays a guy that's dying he uh dying and uh there's a part that's supposed to be very  touching and profound when he's talking about something and the audience was laughing they were  laughing in the theater at how bad really his his scene was this is a drama or a comedy it's a  drama calm thing it's like those ensemble things like uh fucking you know it's got its levity in  one story maybe the sarah jessica parker story has its levity well she's working in central park 
[00:38:00]  doing buggy rides you know she's got a a teen daughter that i believe is pregnant  and then there's um there's uh michelle pfeiffer's in it and hillary swank uh uh zach efron ashton  kutcher i can't even look at stupid ashton kutcher after that groveling fucking sissy  i'm sorry i'm gonna give my twitter to my management teams uh yeah twitter got too big for 
[00:38:30]  me what anybody that can't express their own thoughts they need their management team to be  why would anybody fucking see anything he does and you can't filter your own thoughts what's wrong  with you dope you made a mistake you didn't know the paterno uh paterno story at the time so just  say that like when i tweeted this i didn't know uh what was going on i feel like an idiot period  fucking end of tweet but instead he fucking tries to blame everybody else just a typical worm instead 
[00:39:00]  of just going like hey i'm an asshole can't you laugh at yourself and just get out of course  fucking what a worm of course it's star-studded and it made 13 million opening i don't think that's  gonna pay for is that a lot or no hoof is this real bad is this an ensemble cast yes ensemble cast  they made 13 million that means it's gonna be dead in the water it's done yeah it's done that's it  it's not gonna go off jessica biel does anybody enjoy her work like she's pretty but what has  she done where you're like wow she's great i'll tell you what i liked her in okay blade one of the 
[00:39:30]  blade movies was a three blade trinity uh she was she looked damn good in that fucking movie and all  she had to do was jump around and look hot in a fucking very tight black outfit katherine heigl is  she good katherine heigl all i know about her is my ex-girlfriend hated her and whenever she was in a  movie poster she would just go i hate that i'll tell you why i hate her and i've said it many  times in the show uh knocked up all right she wouldn't show a movie where she's supposed to be  loosey-goosey and uh she doesn't show her tits she's having the sex things with her bra on it's 
[00:40:00]  like that's just how it goes down that's terrible you know film it another way then where we just see  your back or whatever but it's like no this is a this is a movie where there's a bunch of different  stories right stories what do you like to do that and then a bunch of stories stories and then  they're all brought together in time square on new year's eve which by the way a little factoid  yeah i think the new year's eve uh time square segments were filmed during last year's actual 
[00:40:30]  new year's eve so they get a bunch of the people and they get the the the thing and then they just  got a cgi in little you know two thousand fucking 12 hey that's what dave would say  what a hilarious jew i miss him is he gonna come in soon sam all right he's still not uh happy with  the show he doesn't want to be associated with it whatsoever uh and he works at the world trade 
[00:41:00]  center memorial i know all this i just love hearing you repeat all this whenever uh fans or  staff members who actually know who he is and he knows by sight approach him uh he disavows all  knowledge of the show and runs in the opposite direction but let me tell you he'll make a face  like he knows exactly who you are oh yeah oh yeah i said david he just looked at me and just ran away 
[00:41:30]  he didn't talk to you no god no it is him that bastard we got him a yankee cranky and everything  yeah well yeah his shitty family probably gave him so much flack for that i'm sure that's idiots  because he thinks that the show costume is the reason that he's not doesn't have a better job now  no it's because he's you know i'd still like to get him here yeah yeah i'm i because he's a weirdo  i try he's lucky at us he's the greatest person that's ever been on the show well you know who's 
[00:42:00]  gonna say anything different sorry david's better than pat duffy is an action pat duffy's an action  hero right that's true uh david different genre cerebral thing different genre duffy would get  you fired by accident because he's so crazy like pat duffy will do anything like if you're like hey go  bite that kid's fingers off he would do it that would do pat's the greatest thing on the radio and he's  also like very scary because every time he does something you're like oh like we he will never  call him he's like luca brazzi of radio stunts duffy will never call himself off like you have to 
[00:42:30]  rein him in and i don't trust us enough but he's also like a go-to guy like you tell him what to do  and he'll do anything whereas david never want to do anything we just talk to him yeah and that's  all you need to do perfect the perfect mixture of the two cream pie jones oh yeah just a fucking  idiot who also was too stupid to say no to stunts i'll never forget but he hates this but does he  yeah yeah but he's doing well after his internship obviously no oh what happened to him he's still 
[00:43:00]  working in a restaurant somewhere oh boy but he's convinced but he's a college graduate oh yeah he's  and he's deep in the hole under his belt right internship yeah no he thinks that it's because people  look up intern jared on the internet from opian anthony and find him uh in videos with shit fecal  videos but at that point once you grow some facial hair dye your dye your regular hair and lose some  weight no one will know it's the same and don't say you're intern jared from the opian anthony show  kind of fudge things around say you know i was an intern at sirius xm satellite radio well i also 
[00:43:30]  don't think that that's the reason why he hasn't found anything he's not crediting himself with the  fact he's a fucking idiot so that's well that's true okay huge him being an idiot you think is  more yeah that's to it than i feel like past yeah that's holding him back yeah i hear why would you  ever admit you work for opian anthony i don't even admit that no i really don't i'm not i i just say  uh marketing i go i've said this i go i'm in broadcasting i don't even say broadcasting because  that makes them go oh yeah yeah because then they go like oh what do you do i'm just like yeah 
[00:44:00]  it's kind of behind the scenes i go they go where you work i go sirius xm especially when you're you  know doctor's visits or whatever and you have to fill out all that shit yeah and they go oh what  do you do there because now they're interested like oh so i've heard a series like sam uh i'm just in  the marketing department no big deal you know i just work on posters and stuff when you google intern  jared opian anthony yeah when all the videos come up uh intern jared becomes cream pie jones which is a  mock bukkake film uh we did that to stalker patty too big boy makes a duty comes up the uncomfortably 
[00:44:30]  that's his citizen kate oh boy is it jared's pube mustache comes up things that i don't even  remember him doing jesus christ wow big boy makes a duty big boy makes a duty was one of the funniest  things we ever put on video i gotta i gotta be honest it's so do you remember how many times  we watched that yeah when we first were able to just watch it it was well and you remember it took  40 minutes on the air of making sure everything was set up just right because we were gonna have one 
[00:45:00]  shot at this right and this was on regular radio right it was a k-rock man yeah we bitch a lot about  what we couldn't do on regular radio anymore but for some reason this one fucking fell through the  cracks man big boy makes a duty he was yeah he he literally grabbed into a toilet bowl and and took  shit out of it a mealy jimmy shit it was a bad one too yeah it's a good walk out though that looks  like fucking uh i can't even tell you it's mud he picked it up with his hand a whole hand are we 
[00:45:30]  are we doing this again let's do it let's do it i love jim's little walk too who's got the video  these days daily motion if you just go just google intern jared opie and anthony and you'll be set all  day yeah uh some videos probably not safe for work yes we went through a shit a shit stage yeah  thank god we're out of it though we had a few of these i'm like what are we doing yeah but what's 
[00:46:00]  also great we're doing shit play what's also great about intern jared and intern david was you also get  to enjoy after you made them do a stunt you got to enjoy their regret whereas pat duffy no regrets  he goes full force oh yeah a hundred percent all the time it's great but you don't get to enjoy  the human elements of regret where they're feeling obviously bad about what they've done  no they've made a mistake yes yeah i think jared got like 75 bucks for this oh and just had to take 
[00:46:30]  his shit money but yeah the best part of this is you know what went behind this we were writing  scripts oh yeah there were marks we need the right stand we need the right camera angles and all this  crap we didn't know how much duty jimmy had in them yeah take after take of walkthroughs we did  as soon as you flush that toilet you know you don't know if there's gonna be another duty for take two  the gift is finally finally that magic was put down on video all right here it is the audio portion  but look up the video if you've never seen this before makes a duty 
[00:47:00]  oh the music  it's the dumbest thing ever  so gross what what happened in there big boy made a duty  did someone say big boy made a duty  he's got a duty hat  or is this the toilet he just reaches he scoops his hand into the shit  look at his face big boy sure did make a duty 
[00:47:30]  now he puts a little duty hat on the duty  it goes into the toilet and he flushes  bye bye  and he's waving goodbye  he's waving bye bye with his shit stained hand now  as the duty with the little duty hat  gets flushed  he picks up jim's feces  oh you should never live that down  oh dude  i know why uh  it is december on true team  i know why people don't hire him 
[00:48:00]  his acting was  his acting got left a lot to be  his acting was good if it was a silent film  it uh it was terrible  well he was in the scene with somebody that really took it to another level  yeah i really pepped up and walked out of there  duty was made  when jimmy does his little  i don't even know what you call it  it's the fredo  it's the fredo when he walks in  it's the fredo step  i would say pat duffy jared and david  in no particular order  top three all time  i would go uh  cream pie number three 
[00:48:30]  yeah i mean i would definitely  and then i'd have to figure out number one  yeah i mean  we've had this discussion  cream pie was number three for sure  i didn't want to hurt his feelings  but yeah he wasn't as good as the other two  because david's best bit ever was when he had to like  uh give the reviews  the reviews yeah yeah  he just played that recently  yeah and how seriously he took it  and he obviously was the worst intern  out of all of them  that was a good crop that year  if you remember  oh yeah  and then david is telling all the rest of the guys  how bad they are  and what they have to work on  and pointing out all their real flaws  right  and so it was like 
[00:49:00]  they knew that that was a real flaw  so that's what annoyed them even more  because you have this asshole  pointing out their actual flaws  when he just has flaws  right  right  where the rest of the guys  had to do all his work  right  but we made him  the main guy  that was actually his second semester  in charge of the rest of the interns  and some of the first semester interns  were teaching him  what to do  during his second semester  yeah yeah  unbelievable  i uh  god we were good  i have a duty story  it's not your run of the mill  just hey  it was a big fucking 
[00:49:30]  hey you got some on your dick  if you remember friday  uh by the end of the show  as in friday  yes  friday  i was  i was gurgling pretty good  is that why  why you left  i had to get  i and it was a  it was a shit that i knew  i could not do here  i wanted to get home  and spend some quality time  with my fucking porcelain  so i'm driving  uh i make it to a second avenue  driving to the uh  uh midtown tunnel 
[00:50:00]  when  it just  i i have to go  i i and i've  i've never been in this situation  where i can't hold it anywhere  it doesn't matter  i can hold it  this was so bad  that i was like  my my uh  thighs were  were aching  like where your thighs ache  to your knees  and then it hurts  from like your sternum  down to your fucking groin  you have to lift up a little bit  yeah yeah  lifting up  i i undid my fucking belt  my pants  like everything  and now 
[00:50:30]  i'm stuck in traffic  on second avenue  because they don't open up  another lane to the tunnel  until like 10  or or so  and it was just a little  before that  so a lot of traffic  were you panicking  when you hit the traffic  like when you saw that  dude  you don't even fucking know  the  the cold sweats  i was getting anyway  i would have just  i was getting sweats  and stuff  i would have shit my pants  i think  no  i said you know what  i'll just deal with this  when i get home  and hopefully my wife  and kid are not in the house  i would have had to junk the truck 
[00:51:00]  it would just would have  soaked into everything  and i would have  it wasn't going to be solid  no and it was going to  really be bad  although i i didn't know  if it wasn't going to be solid  or not  that it comes into play later  okay  so i had to fucking go  so now i'm  i'm scouting the area  and second  isn't a good area  there isn't a lot of stuff there  there's a lot of little like  bodega things  and and shit like that  there's the nigerian consulate  but i don't think  they wanted me shitting in there  no  even though you've almost yelled 
[00:51:30]  the name of their place  out your window  i certainly did  i should have come to claim  my eight million dollars  that they sent me an email  saying i'm getting  oh really  yes nigeria it's great  so i spy on the corner  a restaurant  now again  it's very early  and new york city  restaurants don't fucking open  you know  early  but i had to try it  so i park illegally  right on  like in a crosswalk  on the corner  i get out of the truck  and i check the door  of the restaurant  it's not open  but there's another door  so i check that one 
[00:52:00]  it opens  damn it  i was hoping you were  going to shit in the  the alley  no no no  i walk in  yep  and these two like  very italian guys  are there  the guy goes  hey hey  we're closed  and i'm like  sir  i really need to use  your bathroom  he goes  we don't  we don't let people  use the bathroom  i go  look  it's an emergency  i work  i'll pay you  i'll buy something  he goes  and then he's just  disgusted  he goes  he goes  all right  it's downstairs  downstairs 
[00:52:30]  so i fucking  do the duck walk  down these stairs  uh  go into the bathroom  and it's a  a bathroom  not too big  but it's got  the urinal  and then it's got  a closed off  stall area  so i'm kind of  happy about that  i go in  you know  get all adjusted  sit down  and man  oh what a  what a  bittersweet moment  that was  you opened up  the floodgates  that i'm getting  rid of it  but it is just  such a  a disastrous  fucking  movement 
[00:53:00]  how bad  did it stink  it was  so  bad  and  the  the beginning  part  was very  solid  oh  well that was  like the plug  well that was  yeah  keeping everything in  then it just  came flying out  and made a  melange  in the  in the toilet  i spent another  maybe five minutes  just cleaning up  and also wiping  like the cheeks  of your ass  the back  you  believe me 
[00:53:30]  the whole zone  had to be done  it was  i had a clean  at one point  i i went to the  sink  and wet some  fucking tissue  and dabbed  and dried  it took a good  five minutes  they knew what  you were doing  in there  because you  were gone  so long  i i don't  i don't know  but  like i get up  i fucking  flush the ball  i'm ready to  leave  and then i see  the nightmare  the the the  the water  starts swirling  no  yes  yes  because of the 
[00:54:00]  the size of the  initial plug  and all the  toilet paper i had  used to clean up  oh you fucked  this poor guy  it starts  and i'm like  no fucking way  it's coming up  coming up  i'm like  ah  i just slam  the lid down  and i start  walking out  and i hear  like it's coming  dude i swear  it's coming  over the  edge of  the toilet  and i noticed  the toilet  the the stall  part  i noticed 
[00:54:30]  the stall  part of the  toilet  has a  little push  button lock  so before i  left i pushed  the button  shut the door  so it was  locked from  the inside  so now  it gave me  a little more  time  if someone  was coming  down as i  was leaving  they wouldn't  have been able  to open  that door  so i left  i saw the guy  i just cut my  head down  i was like  fucking michael  corleone  dropping the  gun  don't look him  in the face  but don't  look away  either  they were  probably  thinking it  was some  kind of  mafia  payback  that's just 
[00:55:00]  a little  warning  like  10 bucks  you didn't  pay off on  a ten dollar  thing and  you know  you shit  up your  bathroom  you pay  the guy  on the way  out  no no  no  because he  didn't want  money  he just  since i was  offering  he thought  you think  it was  overflowing  i really  need  oh it  was  overflowing  i heard  i heard  that splash  and then  i i got  out of there  i got in  the truck  and now  i'm trying  to weave  through the  traffic enough  to get  enough distance 
[00:55:30]  between me  and the  place  that if  he comes  running  out  right  he could  just look  in every  car  you know  it's in  front of  the place  i was that  disturbed  that this  guy was  gonna whack  me out  for fucking  shitting up  his uh  great  his his  bathroom  but uh  oh i got  out of  oh and i  felt i just felt so much better uh but then i just when i got home i literally to myself started laughing at the the whole thing that must have happened after that the guy coming to the locked door hey you in there what do you know hey what's going on and then finally you know jimmy in the door and then opening it and seeing this horrid shit all over the floor lifting the lid of the toilet 
[00:56:00]  just seeing just seeing a fucking uh just seeing a fucking uh god damn nuclear sub in there  he was doing you a favor i know and you fucked i felt bad but not bad enough to make me just laugh my ass off you should have left the hundred in the bathroom you think i should have left the fucking c-note as in look  out there like hey hey i'm sorry it happens it happens i'm sorry the city you come in and it was locked in the door 
[00:56:30]  shitting it happens a toilet  hey i was to say my own ass what if one of the guys were walking down while i just left  to use the bathroom  he'd have fucking  were you embarrassing  they're not even open  oh yes  he knows it's me  he would have beat the shit out of you  yeah  or at least i'd have been there with my head in that fucking toilet  oh yeah  and have to clean it  you think he'd have made you clean it  oh yeah  he was that kind of guy  he was one of those guys  he was like uh  if he wasn't a mob guy he should be  oh boy  he was like that kind of  on the air  well you know what 
[00:57:00]  if uh you know  anything worse when you clog a toilet  and it starts to rise  and then you decide to take the chance and flush again  no that never works  but we we've all done it  there's an emergency method  and that is  and it's very dangerous  because you could get hurt  hit with your own watery shit  that's coming out of the toilet  depends on how fast the water's rising  you gotta assess that quickly  go under the bowl  and shut that fucking valve off  who knows that  shut that valve off  and it'll stop the  any more water from coming 
[00:57:30]  in the middle of  that shit going down  no one knows  no one says let me lay on the floor  no no I've done it  I've done  you gotta know that's what you gotta do  I think you just taught me something  I've done that at people's houses  and then you wait  you wait  you wait  wait for everything to get mushy in the bowl  and then  give it another flush  now the water that's in the bowl  will go down without any new water coming in  so you might be able to get away with a second flush  if not  you gotta  you gotta hope there's a plunger in there  if there's no plunger  you gotta be creative  magazines  newspapers 
[00:58:00]  in a newspaper rack  if you roll up a newspaper  the size of the drain  at the bottom of the toilet  you can push it all through  and push it in  let it get a little wet  so it swells up  and then  pull that fucker out  that'll get the shit down  and then just put the magazine back on the rack  in the rack  who cares  that's what I think of time  oh no it's Tony the Deuce  Tony the Deuce  oh shit  did you see who just walked in  Tony the Deuce was here  the music plays  the Deuce  Jack Waltz woke up with a big log of shit in his bed 
[00:58:30]  that was happening in our building  we were getting backup shit from other apartments for a while  yeah  holy  in your toilet  yes  ew  it's bad enough when your own toilet fucking backs up  and you gotta deal with that  imagine someone else's shit  I don't know what the hell  they were having some kind of problem  where it was backing up into ours  and we had to call the maintenance guy  and we had to like  you know  convince him that it wasn't our shit  horrible  right to the tippy top too 
[00:59:00]  sorry  gotta bounce the guy  bye bye  what happened  doink  what happened  he's an asshole  fuck him  was he complaining about some scumbag  who came into his restaurant  yes  yes he was  no he's giving us all kinds of shit  oh they're reaching today  reaching  oh talking about  fuck you  this is a great hour of radio  kids are shit about you  you don't like it  don't listen  now I just  I just forced you not to listen  I am so done with the assholes  I'm banning him too  I'm just  I don't want him back any other day  I'm just so fucking done with him

[01:27:00]  because you're delusional  you're a cubicle  fucking dwelling  shithead  who thought you  were a supervisor  in your weird head  in your fucking  rupert pupkin head  you got this delusion  you went into work  and said  i want more money  because i'm a boss  and they said  no you're an idiot  and then they fired you  because you're delusional  and thought you were  a boss for a day  no because you know  what people should be  paid what they're  what they fucking  no you fucking  you're an idiot  you have a boss  you have supervisors  and you're the guy  in the cubicle 
[01:27:30]  that does their bidding  you went to sleep  you woke up  with a mental delusion  from not enough  medication  or whatever it may be  and then you went  to work thinking  you were one of  those supervisors  when you really weren't  and then you demanded  more money  i'm gonna let you go  i'm gonna let you talk  i'm just gonna sit here  you're crazy  what do you  what happened  what do you do  for a living character  so how long  you've been out of work  i've been out of work  a couple months now

[01:28:30]  yeah he's gonna get into radio  he's just gonna call every day  oh cool  jordan  i think people  i think people actually  enjoy what i what i talk about  on air  because i'm i'm obviously  uh i'm obviously  keeping your show going  he's not wrong there  he's keeping our show going  come on  get us get us to 10  jordan  go ahead  he's not wrong there  he's already done about  about 20 minutes of radio  for us  do his show jordan  take us to 10  go  you're on  by the way  someone's saying  that's not laid off  that's fire  yeah you got fired  you didn't get laid off  you got fired 
[01:29:00]  fair is fair  they're saying it's uh  a firing  not a  naga naga  naga work you no more  well obviously those people  did not respect my uh  intelligence and my  knowledge and my  and my hard work  and my dedication  all the people that  that worked under me  hold on hold on  hold on  no one worked under you  i want to know what this  130 iq is  can you prove you have  a 130 iq  i can take an iq test  again i haven't been  tested  can we do that at least  dan or or no  oh please  because i i would love  to call him out if he's 
[01:29:30]  not a 130  because uh james the  psycho has something  james  hello boys  yes  listen i'm a  psychologist um i  give these tests for  a living a 130 iq is  the 99th percentile  that's genius level  i thought 150 was  genius  so you're a genius  no  150 is genius  130 boys  100 is the average  130 is two standard  deviations above that  average that's the  99th percentile  jordan can you prove 
[01:30:00]  you're a genius  yeah  you're a genius  you're a genius  with a 130  most of my friends  everybody knows  i'm a fucking genius  because they always  have the answer to  everything  he does  yeah he does  he's proven that  on the show  i thought 150 was  genius  well  maybe they lower  150 is pretty  fucking high  maybe they had to  lower the standards  because of those  people  what  150 is a very  difficult score to  get  yeah that's like  so can you ask him  a question right now  james the psycho  oh boy 
[01:30:30]  um  it's not like that  boys  it's not  yeah i know  i know  it's like bobby fisher  was in the 190s  i think  190s  that's crazy  bobby fisher was  amazing  shut the fuck up  he's right  can we at least  give him an IQ test  to see if he's a 130  we should  yes  let's do that  how do we  do it  you'd have to come  get my contact info  i will do this  of course you will  you're a whore  you'll do anything  for this show  you fucking whore 
[01:31:00]  that's james the psycho  saying he would do this  that was me  no i heard him  believe me  horrible voice  alright hold on  now we have to  i listen to the show  every day  you know jordan  just might be a genius  because i thought  we were done with him  and now we have to  have the IQ test  so he's figuring  out how to stay  alive with this  radio show  uh james the psycho  hold on  we're gonna get  your info  and uh jordan k  hold on alright  figure out how to  write profoundly  retarded  because that's  what's gonna be  at the top  of the fucking  IQ test  do you want  to have some 
[01:31:30]  kind of uh  IQ test  bet with jordan k  uh sure  yeah  do you really  oh yeah  or no  why wouldn't i  no  why not  what are you doing  i can't read you  today  do you  yeah  you  a real  late  this weekend  what happened  what happened  there  never mind  never mind  what why  are you so  well hold on  i think he said  you didn't get  laid this weekend  oh really  oh really  is that what you  said jordan  jordan why 
[01:32:00]  so preoccupied  with my sex life  now genius  that's an easy  question right  elaborate  and tell me  why are you  so preoccupied  with my sex life  i got you under  i i obviously  i'm under your  skin and and  it's making for  good radio right  now  no you're not  under my skin  you're an idiot  like someone  getting under my  skin would be  somebody that's  clever clever and  sharp that i can't  really come back to  that's right  like chip  like when i said  hey that's a good  hat would you get  that from the hat  convention  yeah that 
[01:32:30]  fucking that  stunned me right  there  cracked up  i was fucking  i was wobbly  after that one  so you're not  getting under my  skin you're just  you're you're an  idiot  just because  someone's an  asshole doesn't  mean they're  getting under  your skin  i bump into  assholes every  fucking day  people that  actually get to  me that's another  thing and and  tell me why so  preoccupied with my  sex life  because i i  obviously uh you  you you started  saying shit about  me so oh that's  it you're like  yeah trying to  live vicariously 
[01:33:00]  through me are  you  i'm just looking  to see when uh  what i'm gonna  explain what that  means first  you want to  explain  dummy uh bobby  fisher was 167  okay that might  i mean this guy's  just saying it he  might not be  right  but that's but  that's 60 points  above i'm sorry  37 points above  what is considered  genius right  and my scale was  150 and i thought  he was 190 so  it's 40 so it's  around the same  thing i was just 
[01:33:30]  wrong obviously  gotcha uh  jordan you're  gonna take the  iq test now  and are we having  a real bet  or no  uh what kind  of bet  what do you  think that he  has to hit  130 or something  happens  yeah unless  it's 130  oh he's panicking  already it doesn't  go away it's it's  not a knowledge  test it's a  potential uh your  potential for for  absorbing information  and for figuring 
[01:34:00]  out things it  doesn't it doesn't  go away it's not  like you know  it's an intelligence  test how much  intelligence you  have not how much  knowledge get it  okay yeah i i  totally understand i'm  just what i'm i'm  not trying to  interrupt you because  you're obviously  have the power of  hanging up on me at  any given time but  whatever all right  hold on  einstein was 160  oh again this is i'm  just reading this  al al albrecht 
[01:34:30]  holler 190 i don't  know who he was he  must have been an  inventor that's like  an that's a space  i think that's the  guy that invented  uh angry birds  pretty smart  yeah iq is i believe  in it stupid orange  bird i fucking hate  it ruining the  franchise but warhol  was 86 iq doesn't  mean anything i mean  he was looking at the  art genius he had  like even though i'm  not a huge fan of  his yeah if it's too  high you become a  weirdo is what it  is well it's like  yeah no i don't  say it yeah well 
[01:35:00]  iq is like 450 but  the thing with jordan  is he's 130 which  means if that's true  he's a genius and he  certainly has the  social skills as well  so he's got the  full package in it  he really does have  the full package  yeah yeah he's  everything all right  hold on the line  because you got to  take that iq test now  jordan this is why i  called you the king at  fh riley's the king  right here and uh and  by the way the the  food at fh riley's was  amazing that burger was  the best burger i've  had been as good as  your asperger's  well i actually uh if 
[01:35:30]  you want to hear a  funny story i uh kind  of uh let's have  someone else tell it  i showed my family my  asperger with cheese it  was great it was the  most awkward moment in  my family's history  what's that what  happened you didn't  hear what i said i  did not because they  was being pretty funny  there yeah no he was  i didn't hear what  fair is fair he was  kind of mumbling um  so i uh i pulled on  my pants and showed my  family my asperger with  cheese oh fuck that's  pretty good it's not  true though did that  really happen no look 
[01:36:00]  at his dumb face why  look at that dumb  fucking face he looks  like bobo on uh steroids  i have i have the  ability of changing my  face very much so that's  not twilight zone like  every day yeah he kind  of he kind of like  changes it up a little  bit i noticed that too  by the way that guy who  wrote was a dummy  fisher was 187 187  yeah and einstein was  160 damn it so smart  bobby fisher was  dolph lundgren is 
[01:36:30]  160 so why didn't he  figure out what why  was he playing chess  instead of figuring out  the universe they would  have said the same thing  about einstein if he  played chess good point  because he would have  been probably he  fisher would have  smashed him and then  he would have had to go  back to math god nerd  ed oh jordan liked  that oh all right jordan  uh hold on a line  needy wanting shit ed  you don't ask how the  weekend what what are  you buddies i'm just  actually showing interest  in because i love this  comedy i just wanted to  see how it's going 
[01:37:00]  no one cares well jimmy  had some great shows in  doyle's town that was  amazing i heard it was  really loved it what's  going on with the  patrice ad oh i just saw  that in the daily news i  twittered it it just said  it was it's a car it's in  the funny papers what in the  cartoons it's in the funny  paper between the lines just  has a picture of patrice  today and it says  righteous over a picture  of it says patrice  donnell the greatest i  love it fuck is that  awesome yeah can we  tweet that i just did i  want to tweet again yeah  i'll retweet you then

[01:38:00]  of fucking people man and  we felt like it was the  right thing to do and it  seems like you guys would  pay for that stuff so you  know that's that that's  something jordan shut up  don't chime in during this  it's very important and  you're not  you should have put me on  hold you did it already  jordan that's amazing  because it's not even  available yet yeah yeah  good one but i mean you  know a lot of no it's not  no i'm talking about that  you dumb fuck it's just  130 huh it's the stuff he  did on our show because a  lot of people ask you what  could they do this would be  beautiful and uh none of 
[01:38:30]  the money's going to us or  the company oh god he's  talking about it and he's  one of the he was one of  the most funniest fucking  guys ever oh well really  well coming from you that  means nothing do you know  by the way who the  highest iq on this list is  that i can see it's 228  oh god i didn't want you  to know it's a woman  oh  no it's worse her name is  marilyn voss there's no  way there's no way there's 
[01:39:00]  no way she got it all from  the voss family from that  lineage all the points went  to her are you kidding no  look what is what is  look up marilyn voss oh  marilyn marilyn can you  imagine if rich is actually  well somehow related to  her how funny that would  be what is marilyn voss do  i didn't say just of course  american magazine columnist  author lecturer and  playwright who rose to fame  through her listing in the  guinness book of world  records under highest iq wow  you think uh she uses a lot 
[01:39:30]  of big words yeah is her  name marilyn voss savant  that's her name yeah wow i  thought there was a listing  what are the odds let me see  your face looks like voss is  like the middle name because  rich is rich idiot savant they  lowercase it what is that what  does it mean when you  lowercase the middle name it's  like a von something i don't  know what does anyone know  no marilyn voss savant it  looks like her name is  marilyn voss savant which we  had a genius here to ask and  the and the voss part wow she  kind of looks like she could be  related to voss but she's a 
[01:40:00]  columnist so it's like who  cares what a waste highest iq and  you're you're a columnist  pulger's a chess player she's  170  reagan was 105 yeah what really  all right jordan hold on a line  you're gonna do your iq test  okay man it doesn't think you're  you'd come close to 130 no  you're an 80 i was 450 you're  450 that's pretty good  yeah well it's just like i and i  and queuing all over the town or  something i and queuing

[01:41:30]  connection to kim kardashian with a  big story like that that went down  this year but to me it's even no  matter what the answer is it's such a  an uninteresting story like i don't  care why they're together if it's for  the show or it's for fucking right who  gives them fuck yeah yeah but it's  just it's entertaining because he's all  annoyed like dope he is like they  would actually have him on to talk  about the the new jersey nets get the  fuck out of here cares so we'll do  that tim tebow audio and the debut of

[01:48:00]  showbody and full of shit  even though he is i'm sure  as religious as he's implying  right  it just it irritates me  i don't give a fuck  that you  you christ  talk to him privately  well he's using his skills to hopefully get you know  more people  some believers  yeah i know  and that's and that's a good christian  and maybe that's where he is trying too hard like oh wait i gotta remember  yeah  because i have a  a bigger goal after football  and that is to you know turn people into jesus  jesus 
[01:48:30]  anytime  turn people to jesus  if we can see your religion by your clothing  if you wear something on your fucking head  or a certain shirt  i just i can't stand you anymore  i've gotten so  not anti-religious  but anti-fucking in your face  yeah  it just drives me nuts  what's up with your voice jimmy  what's up with your voice  i was losing my voice on stage  where did it go  the thought was hiding out in the voice factory  ah  that must suck on stage  to start losing  dude friday

[01:52:00]  you had some big drops  that really slowed your offense down  and then in the fourth quarter  it just seemed you guys  went on a steamroll  jesus  well you know  i thought  i think we just kept believing  we kept pushing  we kept fighting  and different guys  were stepping up  and dt was huge  on that drive  and uh jeremiah  and eric decker  and the line  was protecting great  and you know  those guys made me  look a lot better  than i really am  well congratulations  on a great win  and doing it one more time  thank you so much  god bless you  thanks  back to you guys  son all i've ever asked  of my marines  is for them to obey  my orders  as they would  the word of god  the word of god

[01:53:00]  my lord and savior  jesus christ  he's the fucking greatest thing ever  where do they capture that jet  he should still be getting  nominations for supporting  sam how do you say god 
[01:53:30]  god  god  it's god  yeah  god  everyone knows that  like florida  florida  you were getting a lot of shit  for florida  oh yeah i got a few tweets  with eight o's in it  yeah  florida  florida  costume  oh fuck  uh oh  what  you got one of the  you got one of the super jews  mad at you jimmy  uh oh  you're gonna have to deal with this  david  david from israel  i love david  also known as the super jew  david 
[01:54:00]  it's not david  it's not david  steven singer's got super jew  oh  why  why  silva  who's this  yes sir  it's gabe  from israel  i'm actually a new caller  oh hi gabe  we have  we have two listeners  from israel  gabe  from israel  whoa  whoa  whoa  that's pretty good  whoa  yes it's very good  yes  gabe  yes sir  are you in tel aviv  i am actually not in tel aviv 
[01:54:30]  i'm in a place called ber sheva  ah ber sheva  southern israel  okay  can you get sushi there  uh you can  you can get pretty much anything here  sushi in the desert  how come the bear don't have a sweater  why does bear shiver  he's probably cold or something  yes i'm freezing  yes hello  go ahead  jimmy i just want to um  uh make sure i understood what you said before  you said  you don't like people wearing their religion  because it gets in your face  but um  do you mean like 
[01:55:00]  even like someone who wears a yarmulke  uh oh  i mean  and any  any type  of religious  clothing  or  any  i don't mean get in your face like they're forcing it  it just  annoys me  because like when i pray  i pray privately  like if i want to thank god for something  whatever i mean my my whole thing with god has been weird for a while  i just don't know  i just hate  uh  any type of religious clothing  or any type  of religious  talk that's automatic  no i clearly agree with you 
[01:55:30]  and  what t-boat does  you know that's in a public forum  and you know  thanking jesus christ  i'm not  you know  i couldn't care less  but like  that i understand  but if someone's just like wearing religious garb  and  mind his own business  i mean you can't really  you know  say anything about that  sure i can  it annoys me  what about the christians that wear the cross jim  whatever  that's okay  crosses aren't as bad  because they become a jewelry statement at this point  um  unless you're on a giant one outside your shirt  right yeah yeah  but uh 
[01:56:00]  the homies  it's not about  exactly  them  hold on  it's not about i don't think they should be able to do it  i don't think they're being invasive  it just annoys me  because i don't give a fuck what religion somebody is  hmm  i don't care  it can definitely annoy you  it annoys me when i see  um  you know  people who  you know  wearing  full-on  you know  hijab and stuff like that  which i'm completely fine with  that's a religion  but in terms of like  let's say safety  um  you know  that's an issue to me  like  you know  in the uk 
[01:56:30]  where they could wear  full-on  garb  i think that's like a security issue  and more than  a  someone who's trying to enforce  i think it's not so much for  for jimmy  as it is for their own religion  like they have to wear certain things to just adhere to the religion  any of it  any  anybody who's paying attention  and like wearing clothing or whatever it is  because they want to honor something that's a couple thousand years old  it just bugs me  oh  it's like what are you doing  all this fucking wasted energy 
[01:57:00]  into doing this and doing that  could be fucking  that's true  read about science or fucking  instead of teaching all that horse shit  teach moral values  cover god a little bit  and then talk about black holes  that's a pretty bold statement  you're making there  you're pretty much  sick of it  you're pretty much just  writing religion off  fuck them  because all they do is  why can't you have the best of both worlds  i mean i learn  you can  all that stuff  you know  and i'm a religious jew as well  so  you can sir  i don't get any other 
[01:57:30]  i believe my own stuff  i don't dare like  try to enforce on anyone else  yeah  and uh  you know  it's completely fine  it annoys you  and one of the things  annoy me too  and again  i'm not saying  that you shouldn't be able to do it  i'm just saying  it's like a lot of times  i know muslim garb  has been an issue  with train operators  and it's like  how about this  if you want the gig  dress like everybody else  and they fall into this thing  well it's my religion  i don't give a fuck  then go something  get another job  it's like it's this untouchable  well that's true 
[01:58:00]  right  yeah  just so fucking tired of it  causes a lot of conflict too right  all of it  all of it  and this is jews  catholics  muslims  whatever else  muslims that want to wear  their headgear  when they're taking the picture  for their license  it's like what  really  anybody  anybody  sick of it  but as a society  we allow it  we should  society  we should  allow them to wear burqas  when you need to see their face  on a license  oh no no i'm sorry  no no no  you should not  yeah of course not  on that one 
[01:58:30]  thanks gabe  thank you gabe  i was howling door that  because steven s from basher  writes  sirius must broadcast  into israel for free  yeah  that's funny  jeez  oh boy  um  supposedly  uh  oh i'll let lj say it  from florida  uh  old gators fan  uh there lj  no  not at all  go ahead  uh just the point  i wanted to make  is that  chevo's part of that  religious sector  whatever  that doesn't believe  that dinosaurs  ever existed 
[01:59:00]  ever existed  yeah you know  that  i can't even have  conversations with  people like that  so  has he ever been  to a museum  and actually  sees  dinosaur bones  uh  fuck if i know  how do they explain that  how do they explain that  these dummies  think it's a  it's fake  or it's a fraud  yeah  but now what's happened  is and this is why  they have to  fucking backtrack  because it's  they're so  embarrassing  themselves by saying  that dinosaurs 
[01:59:30]  didn't exist  they almost  can't say it  without everyone  going you're a  fucking asshole  so now they have  to say they  coexisted  uh because the  embarrassment of  proof  wait it started out  as dinosaurs  never existed  i believe  i don't know  that i think  they thought  and then they  had to go with  they existed  at the same time  right  yes  and i just walked  around with  dinosaurs  just garbage  jesus and the  dinosaur  i can't talk  to people  why would you  want to  what do they  say  nothing  and i'm not  saying you  shouldn't believe  or love god  i don't mean  that  yeah but that's 
[02:00:00]  that's crazy  but if you  really think  there weren't  dinosaurs  you're a dope  jesus  let's meet  jesus  he's the  modern stone  and then jesus  had like a  record player  that was a  bird  and he would  put the  record on  and the  bird would  look up  and go  that's a  living  yep  yes  because he  lived with  the dinosaur  that's something  you can prove  they were around  man  i've got to  get another  job  that was the  garbage disposal  very good  which was 
[02:00:30]  was it a  mini  it was like  a little  mini elephant  no  that was the  sink  the garbage  disposal was  like a  little pig  a boar  a boar  a boar  okay  yeah  like jordan  forgetting my  flintstone  knowledge  fifth  i hated  the flintstones  yeah you  don't like  them  detested it  and the  lawnmower  the fucking  laugh track  on a cartoon  like there's  cartoon people  laughing  or fucking  hannah barbara  was stupid  who hannah or

[02:03:00]  is one of those  guys saying hey  everyone needs to  do their share  and he's not  doing his share  what the fuck  is this guy up  to and what  how do they come  up with that  reverend al  non-profit paid  him nearly  242 thousand  dollars even  as it carried  1.6 million  in debt  oh great  so he's working  for this non-profit  thing and it's  not even pulling  up pulling  of course  well i guess  that's why they  call it non-profit  obviously but  they're in debt  1.6 and all  the controversial  activists and  his empire  including the  national action  network and  two for-profit 
[02:03:30]  companies were  5.3 million  in the red  jesus  but he doesn't  care  he don't  care  where's all  that money  coming from  especially the  non-profits  are from  like donations  oh my god  most of  nans  what's nans  national action  well  that's latin  network  okay  money woes  stemmed from  more than  880,000 in  unpaid federal  payroll taxes  interest and  penalties  it also paid  more than  100,000 dollars  to settle  lawsuits  by products 
[02:04:00]  of the  unpaid  bills  man oh  man oh  man  so he owes  the government  some money  that motherfucker  money  well we all  know he was  just a giant  hypocrite so  full of shit  that's crazy  but no one else  calls him out on  his full of  shitness  why would they  why would they  and he's working  for msnbc like  like i said  where uh  they all  are preaching  that everyone  needs to do  their share  do their share  with the pie  i don't understand 
[02:04:30]  why they hired  this guy  he's tough  to look at  on tv  their network  stinks  they're dying  and they want  black viewers  that's why  it fucking  sucks  they want black  viewers  and that  commercial he did  he thought that  was a good  idea  you know talk  about eating  blueberry pie  blueberry pie  they remind me  of the gop  but they the  one be  they the one  be eating  the pie  they the one  they the one  they eating 
[02:05:00]  the pie  what's the pie  commercial  you haven't seen  the blueberry pie  commercial  we must have  did this whole  break when you  were gone  last time  it's the greatest  commercial ever  yeah it makes me  laugh i have to  watch it every time  he's a former  fatso that's still  sort of a fatso  and he's talking  about when he was  a kid he was  eating blueberry  pie with his  friends and then  he relates it to  the gop  grew up here in  brooklyn and we  used to come home  from school  my mother some  of the ladies in 
[02:05:30]  the neighborhood  would make  blueberry pie and  we would rush in  knowing our  mothers were still  working and we'd  eat they'd come  in did y'all eat  the pie no and  blueberry be all  over our face  that's what happens  when i look at the  gop they talk  about the economy's  bad and we  didn't do it  we were the  ones fighting  but they got the  blueberry pie all  over their face  they were the  ones eating the  pie they were the  ones eating the  pie they were the  ones eating the  pie and and 
[02:06:00]  wouldn't you wipe  your face off  not to get too  fucking nitpicky  and the way they  eat the blueberry  pie with their  fucking hands how  about use a fork  right therefore you  don't get blueberry  pie and plus if  you're black it's  much harder for  blueberry pie to show  up right you  should have said  lemon you  asshole  lemon meringue  exactly blueberry  pie shows up on  white people's  faces the  blueberry pie  makes it look like  they just dove into  the pie with their  faces and then  they're not cleaning  off their faces 
[02:06:30]  yeah shut the fuck  up you full of  shit unbelievable  what an idiot  so we'll be  following the  uh rev rev  now some back  taxes story but  he's been through  some tax woes in  the past and uh  for some reason  especially with uh  black politicians  and black activists  like this uh  it never sticks  well they um  you know charlie  wrangle had a big  fucking cluster fuck  go on and they  overwhelmingly voted  him back in and  yep god only knows  what he didn't have  to pay um your 
[02:07:00]  mitt romney there  looked a little weird  on tv huh with  that ten thousand  dollar bet  they're making more  out of that than  they should though  it's just a dumb  little throwaway  but they're making  it look like why  would he say  there's any value  ten thousand  dollars  even though he  is a dope  he's kind of  creepy  i'm uh i'm all  about the newt  gingrich now  you like the newt  all about newt  gingrich  tell it like it  is newt  yeah i like his  tell it like it  is i don't give  a shit who it  is i don't know  if it's the  republican candidate  that's who's  getting my vote  these two though  perry and romney 
[02:07:30]  what the fuck  i'm telling you  romney looks like  he could have a  nervous breakdown  at any moment  and rick perry  just is like  i don't know  what's going on  with him  you hear the story  you don't know  what to believe  where instead  of preparing  for the debates  he'd be on his  plane just telling  like what they  called fraternity  type jokes  of course  it's from texas  he's just like  i'm not gonna buy  everything they tell  me on tv but i  found that kind of  funny because it's  very believable  yeah because like  supposedly his aides  were like look man  we got a few you  know a couple hour  flight here 
[02:08:00]  yeah you know  why don't you  study up on some  of this shit  and he's too busy  just socializing  and telling  some jokes  but he's the  governor of texas  but he's got  jokes  you got jokes  you gotta tell  some jokes  is this the  ten thousand  dollar bet  thing  yeah  that went  down  when was this  debate  there's so many  debates you can't  watch them all  was uh sunday  was it no  i think it was  saturday night  who the fuck's  watching tv on a  saturday night  you're watching  ufc fights that's  what you're watching 
[02:08:30]  not a gop debate  i'm just saying  you were for  individual mandates  my friend  you know what  you've raised that  before rick  and uh  you're simply wrong  it was true then  no no  it's true now  rick i'll tell you  what  ten thousand bucks  ten thousand dollar  bet  i'm not in the  betting business  but i'll show you  this  i'll show you the  book  i've got the book  it's just joking  it's a dumb joke 
[02:09:00]  he's trying to  improv a joke  my favorite part  to go back to  the beginning  rick perry says  his line and  then he looks at  the audience for  approval  oh and he got  nothing  he gets nothing  it is funny  he turns back  around to the  audience with a  dumb smile on his  face and it's  like crickets  he's got that  uh matthew  mcconaughey i'm  too cool for the  room type of  personality  yeah you know  what i mean like  he's just so  fucking cool and  smooth yeah  yeah play that  again you know  i'm just saying  if you were for  individual mandates  my friend  you know what  you've raised that  before right  he gets nothing 
[02:09:30]  he looks at the  crowd like that  was a good one  right  individual mandates  come on give it  give it to me  i think these debates  have really hurt  romney because  they're starting to  see what kind of  a personality he  has yeah he has a  horrible personality  i think that's  which unfortunately  is very important  if you're running  for president they  love that charisma  they always have  over the years  gingrich is coming  across like a  strong guy that  no nonsense  ready to do 
[02:10:00]  the shit that's  got to be done  and not  coming across like  these guys who  are just tiptoeing  around each other  a little bit  well who's new  going to pick  as a vp  i don't know  that's that's  you got some  time for that  one will be  someone that's  not in the  debates  they've been  known to do  that just pick  out of some  other well i  just hope it's  not a gag  fucking ticket  ticket like  last election  but that  sarah palin  was terrific  she's really  good for you  guys  voter kryptonite 
[02:10:30]  that was  i disagree  she wasn't  very good  oh no  she was  terrific  yeah i've  uh  first and  foremost i  just have to  thank my lord  and savior  jesus christ  of course you  do  son all i've  ever asked of  my marines is  for them to  obey my orders  as they would  the word of  god  what do you  do for a  living character  character  character  um all  right  jesus  i spent my  whole uh  my whole weekend  playing call of 
[02:11:00]  duty and  sleeping  what a great  weekend that is  that's a good  weekend yeah  call of duty  what's wrong  with that  and sleeping  i was awake  until i think  six or seven  in the morning  on saturday  sunday morning  and then i slept  all day sunday  i was just a  fucking call of  duty weekend  are you getting  good uh yeah  uh much much  better than i was  that's for sure  i've reached level  80 why don't you  ever talk about  ron paul  because we're not  talking about this  on a serious 
[02:11:30]  level we get it  pick up we just  pick out dumb  little things and  and and do a  quick little thing  on it ron paul  ron paul ron paul  there you go he  should be your  fucking president  don't worry about  it enough with  the ron paul  he's not going to  be your president  more importantly  i reached level  80 sorry  and prestiged  you prestiged  that's when you  you cast everything  to the wind  you you throw in  everything you've  built up over  80 levels  and you start  back at level  one and you  build it back 
[02:12:00]  up again  and you get a  little badge  do you get a  little badge  that's uh next  to your name  and you do that  ten times  look at jimmy's  face nice  what's wrong  with the little  badge  how about you  build a hundred  levels  no because  then you you  gotta like give  back all your  shit  fuck that  that's all  your prestige  that's so fucking  socialist  why not just run  around with all  your shit  if you don't  prestige they  beat the shit  out of you  because you're  not prestige  if i see  someone level  80 that hasn't  prestiged yet  i wonder like  what do you do  oh you got your  gear wow you're 
[02:12:30]  the badass  you know try  cashing it in  and fucking  building back up  again  why wouldn't  you hover around  70  uh i don't  hover there  because you gotta  play and you  even if you're  not doing well  you're still  gonna level up  oh i got you  but i was  prestiged in a  whole bunch  i got to like  like a bunch  of 80s  prestige like  40 times  no you didn't  that's not true  you did not  uh one one  another thing i've  noticed is uh  late at night  well early in the  mornings late at  night around 
[02:13:00]  between 3 a.m.  and 6 a.m.  that's when the  homeboys pop on  i don't know what  this is but i've  heard a lot of  racial epithets  from white people  saying things and  uh in my own  microphone i've  heard them as i  play the game  but uh over the  weekend at about  3 in the morning  i'm hearing this  i'm tired nigga  i'm tired  my eyes is burning  nigga where you  been nigga  i've been playing  a game for maybe  four hours nigga i  need a break nigga 
[02:13:30]  and i'm just like  fuck man this guy's  really throwing the  word around like  not even in anger  you know like i  would sure uh the  guy's just fucking  talking to his  friends and then  there was this  little kid just  going oh i'm  beat nigga i'm  beat been playing  all that i ain't  when these level  fucking 16 niggas  come over and  can't even play  that look at that  nigga he got  fucking five kills  he been killed  fucking 30 times  now that nigga  helping us nigga  do they shit talk 
[02:14:00]  to each other  people oh yeah  people who stink  bad look at that  nigga he don't  know but  motherfucking  and uh it's it's  just complete  like race based  shit with that  and they they  love trash talking  and black people  have uh you know  the names that they  put up there like  you can't even  understand them  lots of x's and  symbols and things  it's some kind of  secret code i don't  know but i was  playing with a bunch  of the brothers uh  and then some of  them just decide to 
[02:14:30]  start rapping in  the middle of the  game and i gotta i  gotta just bail out  i gotta just leave  the room i can't  fucking listen to  this shit  why you're there's  your race war right  in front of you  oh well yeah no  i've played with  them a few times  there is a level  where you're uh  playing against or  as uh black  people it's the  african militia  and you're like  whitey and you go  into this village and  you're just shooting  black people it's  it's some game  they've got here  but uh i found a  great spot  that's in the  actual game not 
[02:15:00]  something that  somebody said  oh no that's in  the game  no kidding  that's in the  game but you  you get to play  either part like  you never know  until you go in  you're like all  right it's the  village map uh  and then it  starts and you're  like you see your  hands around the  rifle in the first  part of the  perspective it's  like okay i'm a  black guy you  don't know who  you are no you  don't know who  you're gonna be  until the game  starts does that  bother you when  you become a  black guy well  see you're able to  be uh both and  uh what it  bothers you doesn't  it you should hear  some of the talk 
[02:15:30]  that goes on when  when when the the  game starts and  you realize who  you are and  maybe you have a  team of i don't  know other  like-minded people  it's it really  gets out of hand  jesus why can't  they just um why  can't you just  choose what color  you want to be  well you it it  changes depending on  the game like uh  sometimes you're  russian sometimes  you're uh american  sometimes you're  english sometimes  you're african  militia and it  just changes as 
[02:16:00]  you know you  play the game  they kind of mix  it up like that  depending on how  many people are on  each team so when  you're playing in the  african as african  militia your black  guys they're all  skinny and they're  running around you  just fucking you know  when you're playing  the white guys  against them it is  kind of weird because  you're in all this  it doesn't matter to  the game but  visually you're  dressed up in this  all military garb and  these guys are in  ripped t-shirts and  shorts and big afros  and they're running  around and uh you 
[02:16:30]  know there was one  guy came around the  corner last night  just i really just  took his head off and  it was kind of like  oh this is a little  creepy jesus that's a  great game people want  to know how they can  play with you uh i've  i've played with i've  been playing with a lot  of listeners how do  they find lately um my  name is a noodles 61  on the on um on  xbox uh yeah i'm on  xbox there you go it's  noodles 61 and um don't  try to befriend me  don't try to fucking

[02:17:30]  know i imagine no i  know you got to pay is  it is it i mean as a  bar owner you have to  pay like ufc there's a  special thing you got to  pay differently yeah if  you're putting it on for  a group i blew it because  i went to fh rally there's  a little gathering so to  answer your question i  didn't see the fights and  i wanted to see john jones  badly he was very good he  got rocked um machita is a  weird fighter man yeah and  uh he's this really  unorthodox way he rushes in  but he's really good  fighter i heard he hit  jones a couple times yeah  i think john i think we  should have won the first  round he really challenged 
[02:18:00]  jones like he tested jones  more than anyone else has  well shit i mean up to  this point i don't think  john jones got hit this  year and he's look he  looked concerned in between  rounds really and then  rogan i think or it was  saying that he's like his  first time i've ever seen  concern on his face yeah  but uh round two he beat  the shit out how did he  win jimmy uh elbows uh he  fucking cut his forehead  open with a vicious elbow  and uh he tapped him didn't  he oh no he actually oh boy  what happened he knocked 
[02:18:30]  him the fuck out really  choked him out completely  his arm went limp yeah he  choked him right really  limp he was holding up  holding him up against the  fence and then he just as  soon as the ref split it up  he just dropped machita just  like completely limp his face  was white it was it was a  really interesting start  boys well jones yeah yeah  hold on which watch we're  watching the jones uh thing  for a second buddy because  uh jones is like guillotine  choking him it seems like  and um when he stands him  up like he's choking him so 
[02:19:00]  hard that machita's arm goes  limp his right arm goes  fucking limp and uh the ref  did see it i guess and he  stopped it but i was like why  did he tap he's but he he  was like on his feet  unconscious he was shit he  had to stop the fight to see  about his blood i don't think  he knows how to tap that guy i  don't think it's in his style  but oh is he beating look at  the cuts on his head that was  an elbow elbows are terrible  fuck that's deep that's like a  vagina yeah those elbows are 
[02:19:30]  oh my god look at that those  elbows will fucking kill you  right through to the skull and  john jones has those pointy  elbows oh yeah and he's really  strong damn it go ahead let i'm  sorry oh yeah it's all good uh  yeah he only threw like two  elbows to get that cut but uh  the frank mirror fight was  ridiculous i mean he got he  he got caught uh he was  fighting big nog uh no gara  yeah he he caught frank mirror  and frank mirror was going down 
[02:20:00]  and then uh frank mirror got him  in a camora and nog wasn't  tapping and he wouldn't tap and  he fucking dislocated his  shoulder you see the shoulder  pop out and they just kept  replaying it we were just  everybody i watched the pay-per-view  with was just fucking cringy it's  one of those things where  everyone at the same time goes  oh you just hear the room  explode mirror is such a big guy  too uh oh this is round two  i almost fell through my buddy's  floor of his trailer i jumped in 
[02:20:30]  the air so i was on the floor of  his trailer you're painting quite a  picture there sir oh damn is he  out unconscious holy shit that's  like a crime he fucking put him  out he was jones was uh relieved at  that point yeah he was choking him  but he had his arm choking he was  pushing his hand up to to make it 
[02:21:00]  tighter like that's how a dead body  falls that's a full strength  choke did he have with the palm of  his hand on his throat i don't know  no he had his arm around i think he  had his oh he did his forearm around  it it looked like and then he was  using his hand to push it make it  tighter he wanted that fight over  how long does it take before you  wake up from that i don't know he got  me he was okay they salt you and they  put uh he's got his his arm around  all right he's got him in the crook of  his right there and you can watch  machine his right arm yeah yeah yeah  his right arm he's he's locked under  his neck and watch his right arm you'll 
[02:21:30]  see it drops drops uh yeah that's gone  yeah yeah and the ref took a few seconds  sack of potatoes that is choked the  fuck out take one of those jimmy next  time never oh man i won't get knocked  out man um i won't scary right yeah it's  just too bad for you it's bad for you to  have happen yeah all right canada thank  you sir pan  was it a good car though i mean um yeah  tito got uh tito lost there was a lot of  quick fucking ends to the fights uh like 
[02:22:00]  there was one that lasted about fucking  eight seconds the guy walked there was a  white guy i forget the name uh a hammock  against an asian guy and um it was just  like he threw a punch and he missed and  he just kind of kept his chin out there  and the fucking asian dude just leveled  him where's tito at now you think he's  close to retiring yeah he won the one  fight but then he lost uh he fought well  against uh rashad but uh because he fought 
[02:22:30]  on short notice because of the uh right  and the fucking he lost after that and  he just lost again to little nug  everyone's asking us about miguel torres  what's your thought on that oh yeah miguel  well miguel torres tweeted what he the  joke he tweeted was something about the  ufc fighter obviously rape van and if  they why do they call it a rape van if  they called it a surprise van more women  would get into it because everyone likes a  surprise it was something like that and  dana fired him and that's uh it's a 
[02:23:00]  really weird one because dana doesn't  he always gives guys the benefit yeah and  i was like i didn't know how to feel  about it because i love dana yeah and i  love the ufc and they've been pretty  consistent with letting guys have some  freedom but you know as a fucking guy  that makes jokes for a living it's like i  hate to see anybody get canned for a  joke and i saw it ariel hawani  interviewed dana and what i love about  him is the way he goes over stuff he's  like we don't give canned statements from  lawyers i go over every case he talked 
[02:23:30]  about forrest griffith's tweet that almost  got him in trouble rashad evans and he  goes this is why i allowed that i was  okay with those once he got explanations  and he said for this there was just it was  just stupid like i couldn't he's like i  just i think my opinion this is from  watching it because dan said fox has  nothing to do with it he's like no one  will ever pressure me into punishing my  guys but i think that look and this is  just my take on it is that they're with  fox now it's a whole new level they're  trying to get legalized in new york i  think he made an example out of miguel 
[02:24:00]  torres um but i also think that if  torres who did apologize i also think  he'll be back in the ufc i think that  was more like you guys got to stop this  fucking idiocy because you're hurting us  while we're at this it's almost like when  we were on terrestrial radio and people  like you're gonna call dana out for  firing him no because like we were on  terrestrial radio even though i'm a  comic who believes in saying anything  i want to say i didn't go on twitter  and say like fucking uh you know so and  so like you know and do completely  racist things you have to use common 
[02:24:30]  sense right um so i hate to see the guy  get in trouble for that i guess dana is  worried about the bigger picture obviously  yeah and he didn't say that but it's  like how could he not be the sponsors  right it's like just don't be stupid  because there's no reason as a ufc  fighter to twitter that do i think he  should be fired no i want to see him  back in the ufc but i think that was um  you know i think that was a fucking  warning to all fighters like you can't  do this shit i think i think uh but  watch the ariel hawani interview i'm  sorry yeah and dana really does explain 
[02:25:00]  himself well and it's hard to argue with  them because he has been so because he's  like i believe in guys can make mistakes  he says everything you would want a guy  to say i think uh you're right i think  dana will figure out a way to get him  back in and i think because he apologized  and it's like i i never said that a  person should never say they're sorry  ever tracy morgan uh doing a joke in his  act or imus doing something in the  context of his job to me should be much 
[02:25:30]  less punishable than a guy who is just  it would be like literally if i went on  twitter it said something about uh i  watched a movie yeah there were too many  niggers in that movie like people would  go like what the fuck are you doing like  that's not part of your job like that  would get me in a lot of shit because  it's completely out of the realm of what  i'm doing i'm not trying to be funny i'm  just being a scumbag do you know what i  mean yeah where he was trying to be  funny but it's totally out of the realm  of what he does um it's hard to explain 
[02:26:00]  what i'm saying i hope i'm getting it  across i mean like there's i just i  like dana a lot and i like the way he  explained himself like and why he did  it i would love to get dana on the phone  yeah it'll be he was i wonder where he  is it's been a while and he takes these  things on he doesn't avoid them again  he doesn't send a lawyer out but i'm  hoping that miguel gets back in and my  opinion is that he will um i'd love to  hear his take on it yeah uh maybe roland  could make a quick phone call see if he's  around today yeah because i leave at 
[02:26:30]  9 30 i have an earlier flight well that  means we leave at 9 30 sam no no no no  nice no it's only monday fuck you're  doing a full show today damn mondays  what what if it was a tuesday tuesday  you do a full show fuck when do we go  to home what are you the boss i'm  somebody's got to keep you guys in line  it's got to be you because i'm the one  in here yeah what are they gonna do  okay  makes sense  all right we should break 
[02:27:00]  we got hulk hogan uh that's something  else too oh all right all right you  want to do it now i think we should do  it because it's my big premiere oh boy  and i got a ballad a power ballad i don't  talk to chip and could talk to you i got  it loves me yeah yeah i love me too  what's the ballad  it's um it's called tears  it's very deep  yeah  yeah  kev jimmy back for a second 
[02:27:30]  what's that i need jimmy back for a  second with okay  because it's important sure  does dana know that miguel i forgot  about this until someone uh put it on  his feedback so i i thank marcus hook i  i did know this and then i for some  reason forgot he was quoting uh always  sunny in philadelphia with that tweet  oh i didn't know i did not know that  um maybe i actually didn't know that  no that's a rumor  because one of the guys from sunny in  philly tweeted that that's not their  joke  oh okay  oh fuck okay  uh then i was just believing maybe it 
[02:28:00]  reminded me of something yeah yeah  it's a dumb joke all right like and i i  hate this i really do hate to see a guy  get fired over a joke under any  circumstances  yeah but i i really believe that that  was a fucking like come on man what do  you  it'd be really bad if i think it would  be really bad if it was a quote from a  movie or a show yeah then that would  be really fucking bad  yeah so all right sorry about that i  don't know if it's sunny or not  sick fucking puppies  oh my god  yeah the ballad that's not the one  you got i didn't hear this one they  just were doing i i like to do my own  guitar work and stuff you're working on 
[02:28:30]  your ballad tears  yeah it's good  when will you help my tears dry  cause you may hate me cry  the tea  here's just stinging my  i hate his fucking vocals  you  didn't even say bye bye  he just drags out words  good way to rhyme  like there's no 
[02:29:00]  he just drags them out  there's no tonality to any of it  there's nothing emotional about the way  no i i do  when i was creating that i knew  that when you uh  i actually will do i told sam in the  bathroom i'll sing these into my  fucking iphone because i kept  forgetting riffs  oh yeah  you don't know how many bad ones  you've gotten away with not hearing  but uh when i was going like  yeah it'll be part of the box  you may hate me  i knew that would annoy you  oh of course  may hate me  that's our love  and then with all the words came in  with uh  you who didn't say goodbye 
[02:29:30]  like it just doesn't  i got a random text  i think it was on friday  um  the spelling  made me realize  that this was chip  texting me  oh yeah  because it just says  without  you know  i mean i  no  sort of  hey what's up  nothing  just uh  in parentheses  heavy guitar  of course spelled  h-e-v-y-g-i-t-a-r  what's up people 
[02:30:00]  are things all good  heavy guitar  because there's some  sick fucking puppies  in your neighborhood  oh yeah  heavy guitar  we ain't soshes  and we ain't  no soshes  we ain't soshes  oh sorry  soshes  we ain't soshes  and we ain't yuppies  heavy guitar  we're just  a crazy ass group  called the sick fucking puppies  heavy guitar  yeah i didn't put the riffs  to that one yet  we ain't soshes  and we ain't yuppies 
[02:30:30]  just a crazy ass group  called sick fucking puppies  this is so douchey  can we give the people  a taste of sick fucking puppies  i would love to hear  i haven't heard this  it's actually pronounced  sick fucking puppies  yeah  sick fucking puppies  i know you say  that we're some sick motherfuckers  because where it's cold  there's the ice road truckers  and when we come to your town  the shit goes down  we're sick  sick fucking puppies  sick  sick fucking puppies 
[02:31:00]  fuck it up your tree  jesus i could so see that being a real song  the pandemonium ending  i like that  yeah it's crazy  at the end we just throw  like confetti and stuff  it's a little punk sounding  there's intern sal 
[02:31:30]  on the production  good job  i need more lyrics  for that young man  pretty good  it's the difference  between sal and matt  wow  oh yeah please  is he done yet  this is his last week  although jim  made mention on the air  of wanting to keep him  for another semester  oh really  i'm a big matt guy  isn't that like  not possible  does the company frown on that  please let me in here  yes sir  i saw matt's charisma  at work at fh reilly's  oh yeah  oh yeah  and sam was there  he had two blondes  well uh 
[02:32:00]  sevens  well one was a seven  one was like a  six  six-ish more  but with the blonde hair  and how they were dressed  you know  pretty much any guy  in that joint  would absolutely  love their attention  he had the attention  of both of them  and  and the one girl  was so gonna fuck him  she was all over him  she was  she was dripping  sexuality  right in front of me  and sam  she was out of her mind  for matt  and i'm like  i just don't get this  to the point where 
[02:32:30]  i was gonna cock block  because i thought it was funny  and then i didn't  because i thought it was  even funnier  i was like  this is actually  gonna happen  guess what  your cock blocking  wouldn't have mattered  it wouldn't have  he's too good  this broad  was so into matt  after only talking to him  for a little while  at fh reilly's  she loved him  she had her arms around him  and everyone was laughing  like  he's gonna be my intern  everyone was laughing  like oh it's only a matter  of time  before these two broads  realized what a douche  this kid is  but by that time  the entire night  they were following him  around  and the one especially  i bet they were hookers 
[02:33:00]  no you know what it is  i'll tell you one thing  about matt  he's got a really good voice  that makes people  want to talk to him  he doesn't have a bad  speaking voice  so women will kind of  hear that like  yeah you know  whatever the fuck  he's yapping about  and he's a good talker  that i in a way  respect what i was seeing  because i couldn't  believe it  this one girl  couldn't get enough  of him  they just met  well when the uh  when the internship  uh entails picking up  girls  then i guess  he'll be a fucking  boon to the show  but uh

[02:42:00]  uh huh  see that's her  taking a picture  with big A  you know  you get to see  from the side  sure  sure  I guess she's  part of a  calendar or  something  she's sexy  yeah she's in  I guess a  lingerie crew  and they took  pictures and they  put out a calendar  and everything  but there's  negotiations going  on about our  calendar  she kept asking  me if I want  one  I'm like yeah  I'll take a  calendar  and then she  had to have a  guy go out  to the car  to get just one  calendar  of course you're  a guy  and then  I had to be  really impressed  that I got to 
[02:42:30]  have a calendar  and then as I'm  going through the  calendar politely  she has to point  out every picture  she's in  I'm like I know  it's you  I can tell  you're here  and now you're  here  but then Opie  when he was  leaving  he took the  calendar  yeah  and he put it  on the floor  outside  right outside  the door  so she would  see it  when she left  oh jesus  she's just  uncalled for  he'd been nice  to her the  whole night  and then on  his way out  he literally  put it face  up  the best part  if I could  pat myself  on the back  she's not 
[02:43:00]  going to be  mistaken  she only gave  out I think  two calendars  so she knows  you fucking  dissed her  calendar  that the  calendar  was waiting  for her  right outside  the door  face up  well that's  not nice  oh that made  me howl  fucking made  me howl  it's just  uncalled for  uh by the  way  oh by the  way  my brother  um is  gonna give  out some  kind of  pest card  or something  I didn't even  know this  he like  facebook did  yesterday  uh because 
[02:43:30]  he really  appreciates uh  the listeners  really helping  grow the  business over  the years  so I guess  if you follow  fh riley's  f h r i l e y  s on twitter  uh more details  will come about  but I think  he wants to  do something  for uh the  listeners that  have really  helped over  the years  a little  pest card  maybe give  give you  some discounts  or something  I don't know  nobody took  any pictures  of the bitches  matt was with  maybe someone  yeah why  wouldn't they  take pictures  of the bitches  yeah maybe  because they  were unremarkable 
[02:44:00]  unremarkable  one of them  is a fan  she's just  listening and  doesn't understand  oh wow  I'm sure she's  pretty  huh  they were  they were fine  yeah  they were fine  they weren't  nines or  tens like  he's saying  no he's a  fucking idiot  though  I like that  but he is  an idiot  I got a rod  what do they  have  do they have  absinthe  goggles on  I don't know  what it was  man like  I saw the  look in this  one girl's  eyes and she 
[02:44:30]  was all about  it  they thought  he was cute  like he was  like he was  kind of just  you know  boyishly charming  and everything  and they took  him under their  wing and  went and  put their hands  and vaginas on  him  who's that  one right  there  who's that  bitch  nah I left  one more  who's that  fucking bitch  why is she  not available  it says content  not available  there you go  what  I would smooch  with that bitch  for an hour  for an hour  who is she  I don't know  I'm gonna give her  ass a little toot 
[02:45:00]  what's going on  those pictures  I'm gonna plug her  yeah  everyone was  everyone was  really nice  except for  this one bitch  she comes up  to me  and you're  looking at  a girl  that could  have lost  easily 100 pounds  oh shit  easily needs  breast implants  and she probably  should put a bag  over her  fucking head  goes to me  you really need  to shave  that beard  and I'm like  I'm not growing  the beard  to be fucking  cute  she goes  you need to  really shave  it down  and I'm like  do you want  me to tell  you what's  wrong with  you right now 
[02:45:30]  oh hell  there are some  truly hideous  women that  listen to this  show  there are only  truly hideous  women that  listen to this  show  that's what  I learned  at FH Riley's  not everyone  yeah  but a lot  of hideous  women  see I'm trying  to be nice  who are really  entertained  there were some  sights at FH  yeah  there were some  sights at  yeah  it was rough  just couldn't  make it  it was rough 
[02:46:00]  people who work  at FH Riley's  were just like  what the fuck  did you guys  do to us  what  they liked  that there  was business  but they  didn't like  this horrible  group of  people  honestly my  brother tweeted  or Facebook  said that  you know  he really  he likes  he knows  there's never  going to be  a problem  when the ONA  now I have  to take this  bit seriously  but he goes  I don't  ever have to  worry about  the ONA  crew when  they come  into the  joint  they're cool  and they  spend money  that's good 
[02:46:30]  they don't  look that  great  but  I imagine  he feels  differently  about the  shade  crew  plus they  fuck  yeah  well apparently  so  they're DTF  they definitely  are  well one of  them was  the other  one wasn't  only if the  guy has a  real BD  right  big dick  Sam how many  lookers were  there  um  women who I  would call  lookers  how many  lookers were  there  Jimmy's doing  the Sam 
[02:47:00]  pose  yeah the  Sam face  how many  lookers  put a number  on it  terrible  I'm gonna  beat him  out of it  he will  stop that  make that  face  go ahead  do it  he can't  sell t-shirts  unless he's  doing that  face  it's a  marketing thing  Sam  no one's  buying a  shirt with  that face  it's branding  I'm putting  Sam on the  spot  I'm putting  Sam on the  spot and I  want a real  fucking answer  not some  bullshit answer  how many  lookers were  at FH on  Saturday  I want an 
[02:47:30]  actual number  because you  looked around  the room  like I  did  okay  I can  think of  calendar girl  yeah that's  one  and the two  with Matt  that's three  right there  if we're gonna  call like fives  and sixes  lookers  oh god  it's being  kind  come on  now  let's keep  it at a  six  makes it  an official  look  a looker  is a  seven  I would  think  seven  I would  think a  looker  is a  sixes  all right  you know  yeah I'd  fuck that  and all right 
[02:48:00]  besides calendar  girl  the girls  who were  hanging out  with Matt  were like  at that  bar  they were  lookers  but at  another  bar  they'd be  there at  the end  of the  night  all right  so we  going with  uh  what  I would  say  calendar  girl  I  well  maybe  you're  pissing off  a lot of  people right  now  there are  only  three  lookers  at FH  I think  three  I'm not  gonna say  who  and not  they know  who they  are  and not  the  blondes 
[02:48:30]  no  so you're  counting calendar  girl  yeah  so that means  only two  other women  in the entire  place  lookers  yeah  you can take  I'm not telling  who you are  two  two others  and not the  blonde  maybe the  blondes  hanging out  with Matt  made them  look lower  to me  I don't know  but when I  saw them  hanging off  of Matt  I didn't  think to  myself  now these  are two  lookers  gotcha  you know  what I  mean  only two  lookers 
[02:49:00]  I say  two  not the  blondes  and yeah  the third  was the  pig rose  girl  okay  so there's  two others  she had a  terrific personality  though  did she  nice  I hope he  didn't like  her  I hope he  didn't like  her  why didn't I  like her  what was  what was  to tell  well I hope he  doesn't like  like you know  women who like  know they're  hot and are  just kind of  playing the  game like  you're supposed  to be really  impressed by  their you know  their hotness 
[02:49:30]  or whatever  and it's just  it's the same  hot chick all  the time  no but she  wants to do  the radio  show  and when I  do Otto's  pig rose  she insists  that she's on  that episode  oh  because maybe  we can do  a little  back and  forth with  each other  little banter  little friendly  little banter  I hear ya  and I hope he  was just being  weird with the  calendar and she  didn't know how  to react to his  humor  like cause she's  not thinking  like she's used  to just  no one does  she's used to  just guys being  like oh yeah  okay  you're hot  and Opie was  like look it's  you again 
[02:50:00]  on the calendar  like a little  kid  and she was  like yeah  that's me  you're on  for two months  she was  well it doesn't  make sense  to have a girl  on more than  one month  well this might  be more of  like a Larry  David type  thing but  if you're  a calendar  girl you  shouldn't be  on two months  in a row  no  and then she  had to explain  why  unless the calendar  is only you  cause July  didn't show up  so in a pinch  she decided to be  July even though  she's June  she's part of  February as well 
[02:50:30]  and then she's  part of December  oh boy  which you should  put the November  girl in for  it's not like  they weren't  month themed  they were just  girls in lingerie  but I forced  her to explain  you knew it  couldn't be  an interesting  story and as  it turns out  it wasn't  yeah  it's the worst  bar conversation  there ever was  but at least  I'll get my  calendar back  hopefully  why you threw  it on the  ground  I wonder how  many cars  rented over  yeah there has  to be I mean 
[02:51:00]  it was made  of paper  it was not  like you know  it wasn't a  calendar calendar  you missed a good  time I gotta tell  you  boy it sounds  like I did  you missed a  really good  time  damn  I enjoyed  myself  chilling with  Jordan  Jordan was  cool  that would have  just been  great  Bobo as a  table  half the night  yeah  alright why don't  we  and every other  party I've ever  been to  20 times over  I hear you  got it  yeah  get the gist  yeah I don't  have to go to  everyone  it's okay  alright we got 
[02:51:30]  Obama on 60  minutes but more  importantly Hulk Hogan  is now suing his  ex-wife Linda  I'll see you guys  tomorrow  Wednesday  are you really  leaving us  I have to go  to go  and there's no  reason to listen  to the rest of  the show  no reason for us  to be here either  then  you too  I'd say  Opie Anthony  why don't you guys  try to be the best  Jimmy's really the  backbone of the show  and I think if he  leaves  we should all  just probably  skedaddle  we should ride  Jimmy's fucking  back right the  fuck out of here  I think it's a  tribute to Jimmy 
[02:52:00]  and how great he is  yeah  we should  you know  what would Jim  have wanted  Jim probably would  have wanted you  to go to  Queensbury  to the Saratoga  Comedy Club  Friday and  Saturday  because I'm on  my tiny comedy  club tour  to get the  hour ready  Saratoga is a  nice fucking  area  I like that  gate too  it's too bad  you're going  in the middle  of winter  I know  summertime  August is the  time to go  to Saratoga  oh you catch  the horse races  check out  the races  I have loved  these small  shows  you're loving  it  I did  two shows 
[02:52:30]  in a row  I did an hour  and twenty minutes  hour and twenty  five  I never do  that kind  of time  it's nice  it's fun  it's nice  great crowds  oh Jim  big fans  all right  Jimmy  and are you  going to LA  is that what's  going on  Leno tomorrow  right now  yeah I'm going  out in the  tonight or  tomorrow  tomorrow  I fly tonight  but the  bet's tomorrow  and I'm back  Wednesday  Wednesday  on the plane  over the night  as long as I  don't crash and  die  if I crash and  die  let me just  say that I've  enjoyed my time  on this program  and with all  my family and  friends  and if I  happen to be  in some state  where you're  not sure if I'm 
[02:53:00]  alive or not  just kill me  I don't want  to live  uncomfortably  all right  Jim  if I happen  to come out  of that plane  fucked up  oh no  don't say that  yeah this is  a terrible way  I know that  but just  just cover my  bases  can't you just  write all that  in your last  week  I don't think  that counts  on a radio  show  it's not legal  either  it's not legal  but it would  hold up  oh could you  spend time  in prison  just to  fucking bail  me out  it would  no no  it would  it would  it would  hold up  you think  yeah very  rational  I don't know 
[02:53:30]  in the end  it would hold up  no but you  can't kill  somebody  no not kill  me I'm just  saying make  sure that my  wishes are  known  yeah we'll  tell your  model  yeah tell  tell that  bitch  why are we  having this  conversation  this is  terrible  I'm thinking  of your  wrestling face  and you wish  you were dead  all right  you don't like  that face  hand  no I hate  it  one more  time  look at it  he makes  a duck mouth  it's to sell  t-shirts  no it's not  it's because  he's uncomfortable  yeah  what t-shirts  are you trying  to sell  I made t-shirts  he's got t-shirts 
[02:54:00]  everybody's got  t-shirts now  oh wait I might  have a picture  of Matt's  girls  big A was  wearing his  I mean live  from the compound  t-shirt  hey  I got Matt's  girls  oh you did  let me see  that's not  Matt's  what  no here  here's the  picture of  Matt's  girls  that's three  gay guys  fucking each  other  I like the  fact that they  photoshopped it  into the dining  room of FH  Riley  it's a fine  establishment  beastie333  beastie333  thank you for  the picture  I think 
[02:54:30]  all right  Jimmy's out  t-shirts look  less cartoonish  than he does  in real life  wow  oh good  saying you look  cartoonish  I guess  I mean I don't  know if that's  an insult  it probably is  Jimmy just walked  out  it's a tentative  he's busy  sounds like a  Jordan insult  that should be  a hint that we  should fucking  take a break  because this is  just nonsense  yeah because we  got 8,000 reads  and things like  that  all right  you know  chop chop  it's almost  time  to go  it's UM 
[02:55:00]  it's  almost  time  it's  almost  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  Oh, man, it's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  Sirius XM. 
[02:55:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is really awkward.  What's the matter?  We gave Jimmy the big goodbye, and he's staring at us.  Well, his car isn't here.  Yeah, but that's weird now.  It's 945.  This is weird for everybody now.  They have more Jimmy.  There's more Gunner.  More Gunner.  We should charge more.  Yes.  There's 15 minutes.  More-ness.  Sirius XM app, I guess they did an upgrade. 
[02:56:00]  Didn't they?  How'd that work?  I think you can listen to us on demand now through the Sirius XM app.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I demand it.  When you go on to it, you can start from the beginning of the show.  Yeah?  And then once you do that, you can also fast forward, rewind, pause.  Really?  Yeah, it's like a little DVR functionality.  But does the app actually work?  I'd put it on for like five minutes, and it worked.  I've never heard more problems with an app before.  I don't know.  It's crap if you ask me. 
[02:56:30]  Me neither, to tell you the truth.  A lot of people have problems with the Opie and Anthony showing that app.  Crap does sound like the word to use.  I don't know my name and password to get online.  Like, I could listen online and shit.  I don't know what it is.  But I have an account.  I pay for accounts.  I do everything.  I don't know.  I don't even have our channel in my car.  Oh, great.  Why don't you get put in?  Yeah, you probably could.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  It's a good channel.  I listen to it.  Is it good?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's great.  Fuck, what am I missing?  Remember the first Sirius radios we got? 
[02:57:00]  They drill-screwed the fucking things into your dashboard?  Wow.  Some big, archaic fucking radio and this little stand that was on.  And they literally took my fucking, I think I had a Mountaineer at the time, and just drill-screwed  fucking three holes in my console.  More importantly, I remember what I was thinking at the time.  Yeah, this will catch on.  Yeah, this is going to catch on.  Yeah, everyone will willingly let someone just drill holes into their new car just to  listen to us. 
[02:57:30]  No, I was in such denial.  I was, too.  Like, who the fuck is going to do this?  I remember riding around and looking for satellite radio antennas on cars and going like, oh,  there's one.  That's a good sign.  Yeah, that's-  And then 20 minutes would pass by.  There's another one.  I think that's-  Oh, no.  But I was in such denial.  No, I bet you the one guy that has it, he'll just dupe a lot of copies for other people.  Oh, yeah.  And they'll pass it around that way.  Do you remember how we used to tease?  I used to love when we would tease Sirius because of their shitty technology. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  We were just on XM how we would beat up their giant fucking units and help.  Because their units did stink.  Oh, we were fucking-  That was fun, man.  Teasing them.  But I forgot they drilled holes into your dashboard just so you could listen to satellite.  They couldn't figure it out.  The aftermarket shit just sucked.  And that's only seven years ago, right?  Yeah.  Once the car started getting them in, like-  We can't say only seven years ago.  That's a long fucking time.  Yeah, it is.  Bye, guys.  20 million strong.  Oh, Jimmy.  We were supposed to get ourselves fired way before now.  Yeah.  This is a long stretch for you guys.  It's the longest gig. 
[02:58:30]  The longest gig.  I gotta go.  All right.  Let's go.  It's not 945.  Yeah, but the car is here.  The car is here.  My shade's on.  Not on my new fucking shades.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck are those?  Yeah, it's the new Jim Norton voice.  You guys like that stuff.  Sexy.  Yeah.  Just go.  Yeah.  One second.  Get a little sip of throat coat.  Throat coat.  Those are nice shades.  Fuck.  Yeah.  What are they, Ray-Bans?  Yeah.  A little Ray-Ban for your listening pleasure. 
[02:59:00]  Looks good.  You don't have to call him Ray-Ban.  You know what's funny to me?  When you said on demand, and you went, I demanded, and you got nothing, and then you  went, bleh.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Jimmy just looked at me and started laughing.  Someone out there appreciated it.  I love that.  This is one of those things that you think, and sometimes it comes out.  Yes.  You just say it.  I don't even care if things get laughs.  You guys didn't update your apps?  I'm trying to right now, but I can't.  Oh.  I don't even have an app on my phone.  How do you get that?  Just go to the app store.  Oh, go to the app store. 
[02:59:30]  Can't they just take my phone?  Or do they have to own this phone, because I want their app?  Just go to the app store.  Why would you give it to them?  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, see, it's not an iPhone.  Droid.  No wonder it's much more complicated.  It's not, man.  Why don't you have an iPhone at this point?  I love my Android.  I can't make phone calls, but I still love it.  Why do you love it?  I don't really know.  Yeah, it doesn't do anything specifically well.  To be honest with you.  Here's Chris Humphreys.  Chris Humphreys was in that fake wedding, in my opinion, to Kim Kardashian. 
[03:00:00]  Yes.  And I think it took an 83-year-old man to figure out the Kim Kardashian thing.  Kim Kardashian realized, holy shit, if I'm married, the average Joe doesn't feel like  I'm obtainable anymore, and they can put their cocks in my poopy hole.  I didn't like when she was married.  And so she went, holy fuck, I can't be married, because that's why I'm so famous, because  everyone feels like they maybe could have sex with me.  Ah!  Where the cocky comes out. 
[03:00:30]  And when Pat Cooper said that, I went, holy shit, that's exactly what this is all about.  She has to kind of stay single.  Anyway, Chris Humphreys went on GMA, and this dope.  He's a dope.  I told you he's stupid, remember?  He's stupid, right?  He's the dumbest.  He's the dumbest guy on television.  Is he looking like a dummy in the hot tub?  He is, but he drowned in the hot tub.  He's so stupid.  He's that guy that looks like a dummy in the hot tub.  Dummy in the hot tub.  So this dope goes on Good Morning America, assuming that Good Morning America wants to 
[03:01:00]  talk to him about the NBA coming back, and the New Jersey Nets.  There are more people who know him from the Kardashian show than that actually know he's  a basketball player.  No one even gave a shit.  I will be honest with you.  I follow basketball, maybe not as much as I did 10 years ago.  But I know enough players, and I never heard of Chris Humphreys before Kim Kardashian.  That is a fact.  Nobody did.  And he played for the Nets.  But I'm a Knicks fan.  Still, it's a global...  But I swear to you, I didn't know who he was.  Anyway, listen to this shit. 
[03:01:30]  You responded by filing both for a legal separation and an annulment.  And an annulment would say that no legal union had, in fact, taken place.  What do you hope the court will decide with regard to the annulment?  Well, I'm not focused on...  You know, I'm really, right now, I'm focused on basketball.  And, you know, other things will take care of themselves.  So, you know, it's a great day for the NBA and the fans.  For most people, camp starts today at, I think, 4 o'clock. 
[03:02:00]  So, you know, hopefully I'll be on a team soon and get ready to go.  See, he doesn't...  He thinks that that's why he's on Good Morning America.  No one gives a fuck.  Sorry, that ain't it.  Right.  Not even on a team.  He's not even on a team?  He said, hopefully I'll be on a team just now.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  He's just a dope.  Someone with more knowledge than me has got to explain that.  He's currently not signed to a team.  He's not on the Nets anymore?  What happened there?  No, he currently does not have a team.  That's how good he is.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So, what the fuck is he there for?  What did he think he was there for?  Right. 
[03:02:30]  Talk about basketball.  Start shit-talking Kim Kardashian.  She made you look like a dummy.  He's not a clever...  No, he is a dummy.  He's not a clever person.  You look like an asshole.  Exactly.  He starts shit-talking, you idiot.  He has no idea how.  We're not trying to look back.  We're trying to just focus on moving forward.  Do you still love her?  Oh, this is great.  Is that the lawyer?  No, that's his...  Oh, his mom, right?  His mom was there with him.  Yeah, so she's trying to get him out of it.  We're not trying to look back.  We're trying to just focus on moving forward.  Do you still love her? 
[03:03:00]  This guy.  You know, I'm focused on just, you know, what I can control, which is, you know, being ready  to play ball and supporting my mom and her cookie bake.  Oh, yeah.  Is that your answer?  Just answer the questions about Kim Kardashian.  Yeah, you idiot.  That's the reason why you're on TV.  But it goes away.  Like, if you answer the question, then it's done.  If you don't answer it, then everybody just wants to know now.  Right.  What?  He's just an idiot. 
[03:03:30]  He can't even communicate.  Is he at least smart enough to realize that they were going to ask him those questions?  No.  What a dope.  He thought he was there to talk basketball, just like you thought...  What a fucking idiot.  The fairytale wedding, as advertised on television, was indeed a fairytale wedding.  They were married 72 days?  72 days.  After all that hoopla?  After he had to dive into the ocean to find her earrings for her.  Yeah, because she was crying hysterically.  Because she worked really hard to get the money for the...  I saw that episode.  He didn't dive in. 
[03:04:00]  He dove in, but he didn't dive under.  So what did he do?  A real man went under and figured out...  Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Held his breath and got the stupid earring back.  He was just wading water.  He's not allowed to go underwater because he forgets to come back up.  He drowns.  What a dope.  He's stupid.  You see what I'm saying?  Yes, yes, yes.  I'm turning Jimmy's mic off.  Oh, shite.  Don't do that.  He's not here.  I know, but the memory.  The memory. 
[03:04:30]  The memory.  The memory.  It's too real when you turn his mic off.  Did I read somewhere that Metallica, 30 years in the biz...  Is that possible?  Totally.  Yeah, they did...  Holy fuck.  30 years.  Our Pearl Jam expert.  I mean, our music expert.  Yeah.  They did a bunch of anniversary shows over the weekend.  And I think the original lineup played for the first time in almost 30 years, like with  Dave Mustaine and some other guy.  I'm not the biggest Metallica fan. 
[03:05:00]  He is a Pearl Jam expert.  Yeah, hey, you want to talk about...  Cameron Crowe's going to be in today, so...  Whoa!  I thought we were interviewing Cameron Crowe.  No, he's not coming until later.  What?  I thought we said yes to Cameron Crowe.  Well, you probably said yes to him, but...  But he said no.  He said fuck those guys.  Oh, boy.  He's doing...  Roland said he's doing TV until like 10 o'clock or something.  Oh, boy.  That's fine.  Any Pearl Jam questions you want to ask?  Yeah, why do they sing that Olay song?  That's their new song.  You know, fuck Coke Logic.  Coke Logic goes...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know any Pearl Jam past 1990. 
[03:05:30]  What year did he give me?  So I started listening to newer Pearl Jam.  Olay, it sucks.  It's their new song.  I hate it.  It's good.  You want to hear Olay?  I don't even know if it's in the system.  Hang on.  A little piece?  We can play it off my phone.  It has to be in the system because I heard it on the Pearl Jam channel.  But Coke Logic's beating me up because every time I talk about Pearl Jam, I mention the  same songs that I like.  I said I like Breathe.  What album was Breathe on?  That was on their last album.  All right.  I like that one.  Just Breathe, you mean?  Like the slow one? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  That Eddie Vedder's got a giant heart on for?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's very emotional.  That Breathe song.  That's good.  Sam, you got it over there?  So that's a newer song.  So why is Coke Logic beating me up over my Pearl Jam knowledge?  Because he's a bastard.  He is, right?  Yeah.  I got it over here if you want.  I thought so.  That's a good song.  All right.  Listen to this.  Pearl Jam 20.  PJ 2-0, mother.  This song is going to drive Anthony nuts.  Oh, I bet it will.  I like Pearl Jam way more than Anthony.  Actually, Anthony barely can stand him.  No.  I like this.  Here comes a good one, right? 
[03:06:30]  Sick fucking puppies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's your taste. 
[03:07:00]  That's your taste right there.  You know what?  It's just there.  I don't hate it, but I don't like it.  It's just like that could be any garage band.  Now Coke Logic's yelling me through the instant feedback.  A lot of exclamation points.  Ole fucking rules.  Told you he's a bastard.  See, he knows what he's talking about.  Let me go to Travis. 
[03:07:30]  Does it rule, Travis?  It doesn't rule, but maybe Coke Logic is a little excited to be on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Oh!  No, no, no, no.  Oh, shit talk.  Travis called him a fanboy.  Shit talk.  Oh, shit.  I would never shit talk Coke.  Ouch.  Let's do 20 more seconds of Ole.  It's a good song.  Just so I could say I gave it a chance.  Go.  That was 20 seconds. 
[03:08:00]  That was 20.  What'd you say?  Oh, boy.  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  Ole!  Ole.  No, Cameron Crowe was going to do the show, but he was only available at 10.  Oh, shit show.  I have to show, baby.  Cameron Crowe, Sam Roberts.  Why wouldn't you?  10 o'clock?  Give him a fucking picture face.  That's why he's not coming in today. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  We only work past 10 when we're feeling it.  Oh, please.  Fuck this.  Can I figure Monday, 10 o'clock will be tough.  Yeah.  Maybe for Russell Crowe.  You go, girl.  By the way, this is my new statement.  Oh.  I like the company.  I just don't like a lot of the people that work for it.  Okay.  Who in specific?  I can't say right now.  That's good.  Because I got to see who's going to stay and who's going.  Oh, you like the company in the sense that I got you.  I love this company.  I just don't like a bunch of the people that work for it. 
[03:09:00]  That's my new statement.  I see what you're angling for here.  Get that statement out there, please.  Do you love the Brooklyn refrigerator on 36?  Because I have a feeling some changes are going down, so I got to fucking, what is it called?  Could be.  Hedge some bets.  Yeah, you got to put your ducks in order, hedge some bets, line up your balloons.  This is my new statement.  I still love doing radio with Anthony Comey and Jim Norris.  Of course.  It's a pisser.  And I do love Sirius XM satellite radio.  I just don't like a bunch of the people that work for this place. 
[03:09:30]  A bunch.  A bunch is such a relative term.  That could be a lot.  Someone, I don't know, that wants to maybe, let's make a list.  If there's someone that wants to sit down me in the near future to pick my brain, I'm  more than willing.  Oh, Jesus.  To discuss some things.  You're losing subtlety quickly.  I'm willing to discuss some things.  You know?  Like what?  That's all I'm saying right now.  Ole.  Ole.  Oh, all right.  It's going to be in your head all day.  Coke Logic.  I already forgot how it goes. 
[03:10:00]  By the way, Coke Logic, because a lot of people can't figure me out.  I love you.  You know that.  So let's go with that.  Travis was taking shots there.  Coke Logic knows I love him.  We email all the time.  What do you got, Coke Logic?  Ole, ole, ole.  Yeah, I'm really appreciative of Dr. Gay calling me.  Dr. Gay!  They call him Dr. Gay!  I don't know where that came from.  I don't know.  It fits.  I should probably just forget about it.  You know, nobody can remember where it came from.  Dr. Gay is the hilarious man to be called.  Travis came in when we had Dr. J in studio, and he was like, oh, Dr. J. 
[03:10:30]  And then you said, Anthony, Dr. J, more like Dr. Gay.  Yes, Travis is now Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay!  Why haven't any of us grown past the age of, I would say, 16, maybe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was going to say nine.  I'm an old fuck.  Nine, yeah.  All right, Coke Logic, let's go.  Let's get into this.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I just want to explain my tweet there.  When you're doing the top five, your list was very reflective of no more than the first 
[03:11:00]  two albums and Just Breathe.  It didn't seem like you went very deep into their catalog to explore how much great shit  they actually have.  Well, I forgot about Pearl Jam like most people.  Yeah.  I didn't realize they were touring all these years and putting out new music.  I'll be honest with you.  Were you listening to the concerts, though?  No, I only started listening to the concerts.  A fan gave me a whole shitload.  I appreciate that guy.  And then the Pearl Jam channel.  So I'm catching up. 
[03:11:30]  But I don't know a lot of Pearl Jam songs, especially from the last 10 years.  Get the self-titled Avocado.  Stop it.  Why did they name their album Avocado?  Avocado.  No, no.  It's self-titled.  It's the picture on the cover of Avocado, so it's referred to as Avocado.  Oh, man.  It's self-titled.  It's called Pearl Jam, right?  But it's got an Avocado on the cover, so people are going to call it the Avocado Album. 
[03:12:00]  How else are you going to differentiate?  Travis, what was Pearl Jam getting at by having an Avocado on the cover?  I don't know.  Avocado.  I like Avocado.  Makes a fine guacamole.  I, you know, writer's block.  Yeah.  I really like Eddie's voice when he slows it down.  I can't help myself on that. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, the ukulele album is fucking awesome, too.  Ukulele.  Ukulele.  It's up for a Grammy.  It's a small guitar.  It's up for a Grammy.  It'll probably win the Grammy.  It's up for a Best Folk Album.  All right, Kokulele, this is what I do for you today.  Yeah.  I want, and you can't go too deep, because you're like, you and Travis are ridiculous,  over-the-top, uber Pearl Jam fans, so you've got to kind of think a little mainstream for  me here. 
[03:13:00]  A little bit.  I want five Pearl Jam songs I should listen to.  What a herb.  What a herb.  What happened?  What happened?  What did I miss?  The ocean view.  You know, Sam punches up a video for Can't Keep Any Better.  What a herb.  And it starts off just playing this little ukulele, and now he's doing,  it's a Rio video. 
[03:13:30]  It's like on a boat or the wind blowing.  Look how beautiful that is.  Look at that.  It's gorgeous.  I think it's like a lot of gold silence.  It's a rock.  It's beautiful.  What a herb.  Look at that tiny little guitar.  He's on a rock playing a tiny guitar.  And the rock's in the middle of nowhere.  How did he get there?  You can't even dock a boat to get on that rock.  He fucking sailed his ukulele there.  Did they parachute him in for the shoot?  What is he doing?  Bracelets.  Yeah, what's he got?  Friendship fucking bracelets on? 
[03:14:00]  He doesn't have any friends.  He's any better.  And now he's being strafed by a photography plane.  They got helicopters involved in this photo shoot.  There's a whale in the...  Oh, it's huge.  Wow, look at that.  This is an extravaganza.  Whales?  Yeah.  I bet you the whales were nowhere near that rock.  Yeah.  Just B-roll.  He didn't see no stupid whale.  Like Ed Wood.  Find some whale footage.  Ah, some of this stock footage.  I can make a full feature.  All right, let's go with five. 
[03:14:30]  And a lot of people are already trying to give me songs,  but I'm going to go with Coke Logic.  Five songs, not too deep, not too over-the-top.  Oh, boy.  Uber fan-friendly.  Sort of mainstream.  Pearl Jam songs that I should listen to.  Of the last ten years.  Of the last ten years.  Got it.  Because I got the first ten years pretty good, I think.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Give me the five songs.  I think he wants them right now. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, you want them now?  It's on you, sir.  I don't think I'm going to Twitter them.  It's on you, sir.  Oh, you want to just tweet them?  Yeah, this is radio, though, you know?  That would be a big fucking plug for your Twitter, I'm thinking.  What?  Coke Logic on Twitter.  Coke Logic on Twitter?  Hell yeah.  All right, all right.  So later today you'll tweet, so you want some time to think it over.  Oh, I've got to do some homework here.  I've got to look at the master list of fucking songs and pick and choose, and you can't just  shout out, like...  Oh, no.  It's much too important for that.  Fuck is...  This was a two-minute throwaway bit. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, God.  And I've got to wait for him to tweet this shit later.  Yeah.  Okay, here.  I'll do it on the spot, then.  You are off of Riot Act.  Travis, you agree with that?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh.  Oh, that was a big one.  Okay.  You're all assholes.  Dream a little dream?  Well, why is he in a tiny little boat with his tiny little guitar?  He's in a little boat with a tiny little guitar.  He's in his tiny little guitar.  I heard the ukulele album is Dr. Gay's favorite.  Dr. Gay!  And isn't his nice suit getting wet, because it's not even a little boat? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, of course.  It's like he's on a frisbee.  He doesn't care, man.  Yeah, man.  Let it get wet.  But his pants are getting wet.  He's letting his freak flag fly.  Exactly.  What is that?  Dream a little...  Is that literally the Mamas and the Papas Dream a Little Dream?  You know the song.  Oh, my God.  He's butchering this.  I prefer the Ella Fitzgerald version.  I like the Mamas and the Papas version.  I fucking love his voice, but that stupid little guitar. 
[03:16:30]  Him and Springsteen does Better Man together.  Oh, great.  See, Roland can get behind Eddie Vedder.  The whole time Roland is over here whispering, hey, pull up when him and Bruce Springsteen are  doing Better Man.  No!  We're cheap to through the tulips.  We're here.  Eddie Vedder plays the ukuleles.  We allowed Coke Logic to get his shit together.  So now he's going to have the song.  All right.  You are.  All right.  You are.  I'm writing these down, and they better be online for free. 
[03:17:00]  You are.  Everything's online for free.  All right.  Good.  What else?  Online.  Okay.  Let's go with Comatose off of Avocado.  Travis.  It's a good song.  Fuck.  All right.  He's not going to get one that I'm going to say no to.  All right.  Two.  All right.  Number three is Insignificance off of Pinaural.  It's one of the best songs.  Is it?  How do you spell Insignificance? 
[03:17:30]  Spell it out.  Or sound it out.  I-N-C-I-G-N-I-F-I-N-Significance.  C-A-N-C-E?  No.  No.  I have a live version of Insignificance.  Live version rules.  Yeah.  It's better than the studio version.  You guys like it?  That's a surprise.  All right.  That's three.  Give me two more.  Okay.  Immortality off of Vitalogy.  I know that one, obviously. 
[03:18:00]  One more.  Let's go Off He Goes off of No Code.  Off He Goes?  Yes.  All right.  Spot his old friend that left him.  Any of these on Jay Moore's list?  He might have picked Off He Goes.  I thought I saw that.  But fucking Jay Moore picked Evenflow, which is commonly known as Pits Break.  I know, but Evenflow, man. 
[03:18:30]  I've been listening to the Pearl Jam channel.  That song is fucking good, man.  You like Evenflow?  Yeah, that was one of my favorites.  All right.  I fucking love it.  I like that one.  I'm starting to like that song more and more.  Are there any bad Pearl Jam songs?  That's why every single goof I do is to Evenflow.  Evenflow.  I like that dumb daughter, but they have to add a song on to it always now.  Why is that, Travis?  What?  Daughter's the song they use to like seg into some classic. 
[03:19:00]  No, they'll do that with Daughter.  They'll do that with Better Man.  What about Black?  Are you a big fan of Black?  Black's great.  It's a little...  I like that they don't play it every night.  They kind of like spare it like Jeremy and stuff like that.  Yeah, spare the ones everyone wants to hear except for the purists.  Three people in the crowd that are fans.  Hey, assholes, why did you say I spelled insignificance wrong? 
[03:19:30]  I wasn't listening to how you spelled it.  Fucking assholes.  Thank you, Woodfloor Licker.  I spelled that shit correctly.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  It's over, guys.  We're in overtime.  Good break.  That was actually a very fast, like 20 minutes.  See, time flies when you're talking about Pearl Jam.  Oh, fuck.  I think that's because you're making fun of his baby guitar.  Yes, his little tiny ukulele makes time fly.  One of my favorite Eddie Vedder songs, someone is putting Hard Son as a Pearl Jam song. 
[03:20:00]  It's not a Pearl Jam song.  That was when Eddie was doing his fucking solo thing for that movie where the kid fucking  rots in the woods.  Into the Wild.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And that's a remake.  Hard Son's a great song.  Love Hard Son.  That could be my favorite Eddie Vedder song.  We could play that.  I'll play it.  It's only five minutes.  It doesn't matter.  What are we going to do?  Nothing.  Sam?  Yeah, it just cuts into his time.  Who cares?  Yeah, everybody's agreeing with that.  Here's the other thing.  Coke Logic on Twitter.  It's a dumb little thing we could do today. 
[03:20:30]  Like, top five.  Your favorite five Pearl Jam songs of the last ten years.  Coke Logic cheated a little bit there.  I was going for the last ten years.  Oh, fuck me.  Yeah, you're right.  And we'll do the Hulk Hogan thing tomorrow, Ant?  Yes, brother!  Can we list songs on the ukulele album?  Not a fan of the ukulele.  It's not Pearl Jam, Sam.  You're right.  You're a stickler.  You always have been.  Oh, Travis, do you have some songs?  Right now?  Yeah.  It's not a life choice. 
[03:21:00]  It's just your five favorite songs.  Of the last ten years?  Yeah.  You're putting me on the spot.  I would definitely put...  Well, intern Sal says light years.  Well, we didn't axe intern Sal.  I would definitely put insignificance.  Indio.  Thank you, fucking Kevin from Connecticut.  Indio.  They did hard song originally.  And a great job with it, by the way.  But no one wants to acknowledge that Indio fucking sang the song before Eddie better. 
[03:21:30]  You all right?  Yeah, this is going nowhere.  Let's play Hard Son.  Get the fuck out of here.  And we'll see you tomorrow, I guess.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Can I do the live read before Hard Son?  Let me see.  Yes, God, fuck yes.  You should have to wait until after the song.  No!  There you go.  Give me that.  Why I oughta...  I and...  It's Christmas time! 
[03:22:00]  But in Rockland County, it's less and stiletto.  It's more like XXSmas.  Hey, come celebrate their Christmas party Thursday, December 15th.  One party, two clubs, three miles apart.  It's crazy.  So you can get up close in Poisson with over 150 of the hottest, sexiest girls in the tri-state area.  Admissions free before seven.  Is this stiletto?  This is stiletto and lace. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah.  This is my show.  I pay attention to this show.  Oh, yeah.  More girls than ever.  And, of course, lace.  More girls dancing.  More for your entertainment.  It's going to be more, more, more.  What you want, what you want.  And it's hotter, hotter, hotter.  So don't, don't, don't miss their Christmas party.  Thursday, December 15th at lace.  Lace, by the way, is topless.  With a full bar.  That's booze.  And it's 21 and over.  And stiletto is 18 and over, but.  Huh?  All nude.  God damn it.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Both are located in Rockland County, just over the Tappan Zee Bridge.  Lace is in West Nyack on Route 303.  That's half a mile south of the Palisade Center Mall.  And stiletto is in Nanuet on Route 59, four miles west of that same mall.  Check laceclubs.com, laceclubs.com.  And don't miss the Christmas party, Thursday, December 15th.  By the way, Ant, do we have another library?  No.  Oh, this is meaningless.  No, it's meaningful.  I was trying to do some filler, because I thought he had another library. 
[03:23:30]  There's a guy on the line.  We didn't get to him, unfortunately.  He said that, he thought it was me, but it's actually Anthony.  What happened?  That you ruined Love Rain Or Me.  Rain Or Me.  Love Rain Or Me.  Because I can't fucking listen to that song anymore, because of you guys.  You know who does a great cover of that?  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  That's right.  Maybe we should play that today.  Let me see if we have one.  Love Rain Or Me. 
[03:24:00]  I love that song.  Love Rain Or Me.  Love Rain Or Me.  And how do you spell Orr?  Orr.  Oh, apostrophe, E-R.  Yeah, something like that.  By the way, let the record stay, because now I'm being called out again.  I spelled insignificance right there on the fucking paper.  Let me see.  Because someone said, I said I-N-S-I-C.  It says, I didn't say that.  I-N-S-I-G-N-I-F-I-C-A-N-C-E. 
[03:24:30]  That's fucking insignificance right there, motherfuckers.  That's the word.  All right.  Read it and weep.  I'm a really good speller.  Well.  Really good.  Are you?  Yes.  You're getting, you're improving.  What happened?  Insignificance.  That's a big one.  Insignificance.  That's a big one.  Yeah.  It's a big word.  I see all those letters I just read.  It's a big word.  But you said I'm getting there.  That means.  Well, I mean.  Historically.  It's a problem with the past, you asshole.  Historically, it's not like, you know, you have so many good qualities. 
[03:25:00]  What word did I misspell?  I mean, I don't remember off the top of my head.  You're going to call me out on the there, there, and the two, two thing?  It happens every now and then to all of us.  Who the fuck knows that shit?  Like the back of their hand.  There, there, and two, two took a while, but I think I got that shit down.  I got the hang of it.  You did?  Yeah.  I think so.  My dad was very, he used to be a copywriter, so he was very, he enforced grammar quite  a bit.  Oh, did he?  In the Roberts household.  Mustache.  Did he hit your knuckles when you got a word wrong?  Yeah, he always had a ruler in his back pocket. 
[03:25:30]  Sick household of yours?  I know.  I like how he made believe that he had a perfect fucking childhood.  Nice.  There was some sick shit going on in that house, too.  Twisted.  It's kind of twisted-ass shit going on.  I would guarantee it.  You're right.  Rules were to be respected.  Oh, boy.  And if not, hell was paid.  People saying go to the tape, I misspelled it.  Listen, but I wrote it right, so how do I write it right and then say it out loud wrong  as I'm spelling it right?  Maybe your problem is speaking.  Oh, shit.  Sam Roberts in for the kill.  You're not the first person to say that. 
[03:26:00]  I was laughing because Eddie Vedder was singing the same song again.  I really like that he just, he's only got the one tune in his head.  It's just even flow no matter what.  I'll sing about this avocado.  Avocado.  Are we doing Heart, Son, or Love, Rain, or?  You're the boss.  It's up to you.  Sound the same.  Well, Ant doesn't get a vote because he's not going to listen.  No.  So you don't get a vote today?  He's going to pretend to not like any of you.  I'm going to pretend to not like any of you.  Travis, which one do you want to play?  Out of those two?  Whichever one was on avocado. 
[03:26:30]  Say the right one, man.  Say the right one.  Say the right one.  He just makes a fine guacamole.  Is Heart, Son, the right one?  Guacamole.  Is Heart, Son, the right one?  Yes.  Good job, Travis.  Thank you, Sam.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  When I walk beside her, I am the better man. 
[03:27:00]  When I look to leave her, I always stagger back again.  Once I built an ivory tower so I could worship from above.  When I climbed down to be set free, she took me in again.  When she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feet. 
[03:27:30]  When I see a pin of charm, she just throws it back at me.  Once I dug in her grave to find a better land. 
[03:28:00]  She just smiled and laughed at me and took her bruise back again.  A big heart, son.  Be the big heart, son.  Being all the big people.  In a big heart world.  Oh, there's a big, big heart, son.  Being all the big people. 
[03:28:30]  In a big heart world.  When I go to cross that river  She is comfort by my side  When I try to understand  She just opens up her hands 
[03:29:00]  A big, a big hard sun  Beating on the big people  Once I stood to lose her 
[03:29:30]  When I saw what I had done  Bound down and threw away the hours of her garden and her sun  So I tried to warn her  I tried to see her weep 
[03:30:00]  Forty days and forty nights  And it's still coming down, babe  It'll be a big hard sun  Beating on the big people  In a big hard world  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun  Beating on the big people 
[03:30:30]  In a big hard world  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun  Beating on the big people  In a big hard world  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun  Beating on the big people  In a big hard world 
[03:31:00]  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun  Beating on the big people  In a big hard world  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun  In a big hard world  In a big hard world  Beating on the big people  Oh, it'll be a big hard moon  Beating on the big hard world  Oh, it'll be a big hard sun 
[03:31:30]  Beating on the big hard world  In a big hard world  We'll be right back. 
[03:32:00]  The Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's right.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  It's a goofy show today.  I like goofy shows.  It's just Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  No guests.  Tomorrow, I'm hearing Joe DeRosa will be in studio along with Rich Voss. 
[03:32:30]  Keep in mind, Joe DeRosa is going to be at Caroline's this week.  I believe Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday is headlining.  That's a big deal for our buddy Joe DeRosa.  He's headlining Caroline's Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday.  Go to carolines.com for tickets and enter the promo code ONA, all lowercase,  and that will get you almost 50% off tickets.  You'll end up getting $10 tickets.  And trust me, it's a $12 show.  So, I mean, that's a great deal if you can get there. 
[03:33:00]  I guess we started the show with the Lindsay Lohan pictures.  But even somebody, like, I'm not a big football guy.  What's going on over here, Sal?  Talk to me, Sal.  I don't want to talk to you.  No, no, talk to me, Sal.  Because, Sal, Matt is clean in the studio.  All the Ron and Fez interns are in here.  Sam, I absolutely, I love you and I love the other show, but I don't want to be on air right now.  You don't?  I don't.  Why not?  Because I fucking hate him.  Look how long, look what he's doing, Matt.  Who do you hate? 
[03:33:30]  Matt, the intern?  Don't let him talk, don't let him talk.  Okay.  He is sorting these fucking pieces of paper.  That's right, you know why?  Because I do a nice job.  Thank you.  Thank you for turning it off.  He just wastes so much fucking time.  I cleaned up this whole room and he just wastes time so that he will actually be in this room for longer.  Look what he's not even doing anything.  No, he's not.  Sal, tell me, is Matt simply sorting those papers next to a microphone hoping that...  And did you notice he was somehow able to organize the papers while using his other hand to grab the mic closer to his fat, smelly fucking mouth. 
[03:34:00]  I see.  You fucking suck.  You hate him.  You hate him.  I'm gone.  You hate him.  I hate him for the rest of this shit.  Wow.  Fucking asshole.  Wow.  Sal, why the hatred?  Why the venom?  I'm just sick.  But why?  I don't want to talk anymore.  Why the venom?  You can't just come on...  I had a lot to say because you pulled it out of me.  But there's so much venom.  You're like a nice guy.  Like, Sal is like the nice, polite, like, mother's very proud kid.  It can be therapeutic.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[03:34:30]  Go ahead.  It can be therapeutic to vent your problems sometimes.  Like, you don't want to keep them bottled up inside.  It's a good point.  Listen, when I need advice, I go to UCB Fred.  So I would take his advice above all.  No, it's a very valid point.  From Ron and Fez.  Why?  Where did this venom come from?  Because you came in here.  It's all smiles.  You don't even get mad at E-Rock.  And everybody gets mad at E-Rock around here.  Why would I get mad at E-Rock?  I don't know.  This is what I'm saying.  Like...  I think it's jealousy.  Matt, I don't think it's jealous.  Is this mic still off?  No, I put it back on.  It's like...  Talk to me, Sal. 
[03:35:00]  Why the venom towards Matt?  No, I've always had it.  It's just a matter of...  But why is it...  You're hearing it now.  Why is it coming out so strong that, like, it's seething in you?  What is it?  I think it's...  You know, I'm eager for him to end.  So it's just like, I really...  I want these next four days to go really, really fast.  Like, you're getting irritable, like, it's Christmas Eve, and it's just not going quickly enough.  Right, yeah.  Why do you hate him so much?  Like, why do you want him to end?  Like, we have to go over this again.  Like, it's...  I...  Shut up.  No one fucking cares about him or me. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  So just fuck it.  Just go...  Do your good job.  You do a great job at the after show.  Keep on doing it without me and him.  I just don't understand why there's such venom.  Like, it's more than just like, oh, this guy is annoying.  It's like...  I spend...  Fuck that guy!  You know what I mean?  Fuck that guy.  That's what you're saying.  One day we were in Toasties, and he created a fucking scene.  Toasties is the deli downstairs that we get our breakfast from and stuff like that.  He's like, you can't talk to me.  Well, you have to talk to me like an equal. 
[03:36:00]  You come in here like on your high horse.  And Matt, if anybody walks around on this fucking high horse, it's you.  It is.  And you are fucking oblivious to how high you are up there.  The air's thin up there.  I read it in your diary.  So, I...  If you're with the kid.  You're like a diary of a wimpy kid.  He's making fun of his haircut again.  Did you tell...  Did you yell at Sal in the middle of the deli saying...  I did.  Why?  I came very close to...  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm talking.  Cut the mic, Matt.  He's not even talking about it.  Okay, perfect.  No, but it's... 
[03:36:30]  He fucking came in.  Started making a scene.  We're in public.  You know, there's business people around.  Right.  And he's fucking yelling at me.  I said, Matt, not here right now.  I completely...  I was like, Matt, you gotta chill the fuck out.  If we were outside, I probably would have hit him, and that would have been hard.  Well, actually, it wouldn't have mattered, because it's not in the building.  Yeah, you won't hit anybody.  You never hit anybody in a deli.  You can blow me later.  Did you hear this guy?  You want Sal to blow you later?  Now, somebody's...  It was just a terrific joke.  You're saying...  You think Sal's jealous of you?  Yes.  Yeah, how come any time anybody gets mad at you, in turn, Matt, you think they're jealous? 
[03:37:00]  Well, because usually anger does come from jealousy.  Usually, in most cases.  Yes, absolutely.  Now, what is Sal jealous of, specifically, in terms of...  Well, I think today he was pissed, because, you know, he got the...  Talk on the mic.  You're just talking into air.  He got the sick fucking puppies thing on the air.  Yeah, he did a great job.  Yeah, which was great.  I'm gonna play it again on the after show.  And then you said, hey, in turn Sal did a great job.  And then he said, oh, and then he started talking about me for 20 minutes. 
[03:37:30]  So I think that's where the jealousy and the hatred today...  And I've noticed...  You know, you're right.  One thing I've noticed about Sal is he just loves that attention.  He's a detention whore.  I really...  He loves the air time.  That's why he's been on the air so much.  You know what, Matt?  You were completely right.  I think he wants the attention, though.  He craves it.  He's just not getting it.  Man, he's never...  He's almost...  He's been on the air less his entire semester than you were on your first day.  Right.  And he's still not in a bad mood about it.  I don't think that Sal is eager for...  Well, I don't know.  He was just angrily screaming at me and calling me names. 
[03:38:00]  I think he just hates you.  Which I'm definitely not fat.  I didn't call you fat one.  What do you call him?  You said he had a fat face.  Yeah.  Oh, his fat face.  Okay.  You understand that.  Which doesn't really make sense.  I mean, if I had a fat face, it might make sense, but I don't.  Yeah.  The other things were true, though.  The smelly and...  No, I don't smell.  You do.  You have had a history.  And actually, no, I did start wearing deodorant recently.  Oh, terrific.  How old are you again?  How old are you?  I only wish E-Rock were here for the momentous day. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, Sam, it's me.  Oh, E-Rock, you're here.  What's going on?  Well, Matt just announced to the world that he wears deodorant.  Boy, I gotta go.  I have another day off.  Fuck yourself.  Okay.  See you later.  Sex bagel.  I'm hungry.  Well, I mean, I hope that you guys can...  Have you tried to work this out with Sal?  I just ignore him mostly.  I mean, we did have a civil conversation, actually, ironically, before we came in here  about Christmas music.  And then he came in here, and I think because the mics are on, now he's got to make a show 
[03:39:00]  of it and start yelling.  Does anyone realize?  I mean, I think all the listeners realize, but he's the only one who doesn't realize  that whole situation right here.  He's the only one that searches the board and talks about Bobo and Jared.  Bobo's my friend.  Bobo's not your friend.  You just use him, hoping that you'll get airtime out of it.  And by the way, I did call up Bobo the next day and thank him, because I started talking  to the girls, in part because of Bobo, because I started talking to them about Bobo.  It came up on the air that you went to the FH Riley's party over the weekend. 
[03:39:30]  Sal, you were not there.  I was not there because, well, I'm not a part of the crew.  I'm an intern.  And this fucking tool bag goes around to like every event, you know what I mean?  I'm having a good time.  I'm having a good time.  You're having a good time, but no one likes you here or wants you here.  So you think they're going to want you in a less formal situation?  Are you fucking stupid?  I got fans out there.  Apparently those two girls did.  Yeah, you're right.  You know, he's right.  I'm sorry.  He does have fans.  Now, how did you come to start talking to the two girls?  You say you had a three-way with them. 
[03:40:00]  Yes.  Was that your first three-way?  It was.  It was.  Is that exciting for you?  It was very exciting.  Was that the number one thing that you've taken from this internship?  Yes.  Your very first three-way.  Absolutely.  I would think that's quite a momentous occasion.  It was fucking awesome.  Was it weird you were in the corner by yourself if the two girls were making out?  How was that?  Was it worth, what did you take, a $5,000 loan for this internship?  Was it worth the five grand?  Absolutely.  It was.  It was worth $5,000.  Yes.  Like if they were prostitutes, you would have paid the $5,000. 
[03:40:30]  And it would not have been as good.  I mean.  Oh, you like the whole scenario is what you pay for.  Of them picking me up and the whole night, them taking me out, paying for my drinks all night.  What was your strategy here?  How did you get these girls, how did you trick these girls into thinking that that was an okay thing to do?  How much deodorant did you put on that night?  I did as little as possible.  You smell.  You did.  Which is normally, in the past, I've sometimes made the mistake of being too aggressive.  Sure.  I said, you know what?  I'm just going to lay back and just let them. 
[03:41:00]  Lay in the cut.  Just let them do the work.  Right.  It worked to perfection.  Were you like a jerk with them?  Or were you a nice guy?  No, I was just really, really nice.  I played the role of their intern for the night.  Really nice and made them pay for his drinks and shit.  Right.  And you were like, I'm just mad.  I don't know.  I just stood there and looked cute.  That's all I did.  Wow.  Darius will be cute.  Yeah.  I am very cute.  You think so?  Yeah.  Sal?  Do you find him cute? 
[03:41:30]  Sal finds me attractive.  Travis, Dr. Gay.  You'd be the one to ask.  Do you find...  You want my diagnosis?  Yes.  Dr. Gay, please give us your diagnosis.  And that could be your new bit, by the way.  Oh, good.  This is what I want.  I want my new bit to be the diagnosis of whether or not I find a man to be attractive.  That's the new Dr. Gay bit.  Okay, good.  Give us your diagnosis, Dr. Gay.  Is Matt the intern cute?  Not cute.  Not cute.  Not cute.  The diagnosis is not cute.  Negative.  Matt, I'm sorry.  I didn't hear what he said.  He said not cute. 
[03:42:00]  He says you're really, really hot.  Well, maybe he's just jealous.  Stop it, Matt.  With the jealous.  Travis is totally what I am.  The guy who's married and has a kid and a life and a job is just totally jealous of Matt,  the intern.  It makes complete sense.  And Travis's wife is not a five or a six, for that matter.  So I...  Travis's wife, I would say he was three and a half, four.  Oh, right.  Don't I?  Fire him right now.  That doesn't even bother me.  It doesn't even bother me.  Because you know he's a fucking idiot.  If we're going on your fucking scale, then yeah.  No, when I said Travis's wife is not a five or a six, I meant she was above the girls 
[03:42:30]  that you were with at the bar.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Are you fucking...  No.  Sam, you can't honestly tell me that the blonde with the huge tits that used to work at Hooters  in Florida...  Listen, Matt, I'm going to tell you something.  I've seen some ones who work at Hooters.  Why would Hooters hire a one?  Being a waitress at Hooters is not...  Yeah, she's got to be hot.  She used to be a waitress at Hooters. 
[03:43:00]  In Florida.  Whoa.  Yeah, especially in Florida.  Do you know how competitive it is to work at Hooters in Florida?  It is extremely competitive.  We should call Eric because that's his homeland.  Yeah.  Yes.  Do you know how many Hooters there are in Florida?  Yeah, it's not competitive.  Yeah, not at all.  She told the whole story about how she had to go in, she had to put on the Hooters outfit  and make a round-to-round Hooters and, you know, flirt with customers before she got hired.  That's all to get some boss off.  Yeah, that's just sexual harassment.  That's what they do. 
[03:43:30]  And she said that they have to sit down with the customers 75% of the time.  And that's why they get such big tips.  She said she made $3,000 her last week at Hooters.  That doesn't mean she's not a six.  I mean, she's a whore.  She's a fucking nine.  I'm sticking with it.  These are everyone else trapped in the fours.  No, she was a six and the other one was a five.  But still, it's impressive that you got them, well, that they got you back to their place.  They lived in the area?  Yes, in Huntington.  So we took a cab back. 
[03:44:00]  Nice.  Did you pay for it?  Nope.  Why would you?  You didn't pay for any of the shit, right?  Nope.  Good for you.  I bought one round of drinks at one of the bars.  Towards the end?  Totaling $30, yes.  Other than that, and not only that, there was a swingers couple at the next bar we went  to that both of them were also hitting on me and the other girls.  They liked your dandruff?  Or what did they like about you?  What was so sexy about you?  What is it about you that exudes?  That's a great question Intern Style brings up. 
[03:44:30]  What, if you could pinpoint where the sexiness exudes from, where does it come from?  I think I just ooze sexuality.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Matt, do you think that these girls would have picked you up if you hadn't been an intern  for the show?  Like, what?  Um.  Is it yes or no?  Probably not.  So maybe it's not oozing sexuality, maybe it's just star fucks.  But like, how does that make you feel that you have no other talents other than being  a bad intern? 
[03:45:00]  Well, I do have a lot of other talents.  What?  No, I'm actually, I'm sorry to, I'm sorry to ask a question.  By the way, this guy on Feedback in Long Island says that, uh, in Florida, ha ha ha, Florida  Hooters could be the easiest job to ever get.  And like, I could, I could probably wear a half shirt and, uh, and, and whatever, naked  leggings, whatever they're called, and get a job at Hooters.  This is a guy saying that?  Yeah.  How the fuck does he know?  Because guys are the ones who rate the girls.  Who don't work at Hooters.  Yeah, but they go into Hooters and look at who's there and say, oh, these are some unattractive 
[03:45:30]  women.  And they give them $300 tips for no reason, because they're hot.  Go ahead, Matt.  Okay, well, as you were saying.  No, what was your, your talents?  Your talents, yes.  I have many, besides, uh.  Start with your strongest one.  Besides sex.  Okay.  You're good at sex?  Yes.  You're a good fucker?  Yes.  Very good at sex.  I can see Matt has that crazy look in his eyes.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Now, is it just intercourse that you're good at, or all fours?  Everything.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Matt, having sex with one woman is, you know, it's a difficult thing. 
[03:46:00]  If you're going to please two women at the same time, how would you, how would you go  about doing it?  And this is UCB Fred just asking for himself, because you never know what situation you're  going to end up in.  Well, the situation we were in, uh, is they were both naked and making out and rolling  around on the bed.  Were you naked as well?  Yes.  Good for you.  And, um.  Did you use Trojan Bears and costumes?  We don't have to say that anymore.  Oh.  Oh.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  So you just bare back this one.  You were just.  Well, yeah.  I didn't, okay.  When we were rolling around on the bed, I didn't, uh, fuck either of them then, but 
[03:46:30]  I was fingering at the same time, and I was going back and forth, licking both vaginas.  Intern Matt is here.  Just waving the fingers around like it's just the Wild West, and you've got your two finger  guns.  It's Intern Matt.  Finger in.  Fingers for all.  And I was rubbing and sucking each boobies from each girl.  Each boobies.  So, four boobies in general.  Maybe it's the emotional maturity that you've achieved that they're so attracted to.  Yeah.  And, uh, the one of them was, uh, sucking my cock on and off and rubbing it. 
[03:47:00]  Rubbing.  This is while you had the gun pointed at their head, like, cause I really think.  Did you have a gun?  You threatened them.  You didn't have a gun.  No.  Um, but the one who you liked so much that you said was a nine because she worked at  Hooters in Florida.  Right.  Um, she didn't do much to you.  No, not as much as the other one.  The other one, who even you'll admit wasn't quite as hot as Hooters go.  She wasn't quite Hooters in Florida level hot.  She was hot, but not as hot as the Hooters go. 
[03:47:30]  Like, do you think she could get a job at Hooters in Florida?  Was she hot enough for that?  No, because her tits weren't that big.  Okay.  You gotta have big tits.  She didn't have that.  Is that right?  She didn't have Hooters big tits.  I see.  What were her strengths?  Uh, well, she, she was very, uh, sexy and she was very good at sucking cock.  And she also, what I like is that she fucked me, like not the opposite.  Usually I like to be the one that fucks, but she got on top of me and started fucking  me.  Good for you. 
[03:48:00]  And I, she told me in the morning that I came, but I don't remember coming.  I remember fucking her for like 10 seconds.  And then the next thing it was like four hours later and I woke up.  You came inside her maybe?  I don't know.  Did you wear a condom?  No, definitely not.  Why not?  I don't like condoms.  Yeah, but don't you think it might've been somewhat smarter?  If like, if you're getting picked up at a bar, right?  Yeah.  And the reason you're getting picked up at this bar is simply because a fan of the  show wants to sleep with somebody who's on the show.  Right.  Uh, do you think it's out of the realm of possibility that maybe they want to take that precious Prince 
[03:48:30]  intern Matt Seed and, and, and, and impregnate themselves?  Is that out of the way crazy idea?  No.  But you'd be cool with that.  It's not that crazy.  Would you, if you found out that she was to be the mother of your child?  Yes.  And the kids would be like Lenny from Over Mice and Man.  If you found out that little Lenny was going to pop out of her and using your seed, would 
[03:49:00]  that be exciting to you?  Yeah.  You're ready to be a father.  I would be an amazing dad.  You're not ready to graduate college, but you're ready to be a father.  I would be a terrific dad.  Cool.  I really would.  I'd be a cool dad.  Would you make an honest woman out of her?  Uh, what does that mean?  Marry her.  No.  You wouldn't marry her.  Well, maybe.  I mean, you never know.  How is the, how is the relationship beyond the, uh, as you said, fucking and finger banging?  With who?  The one who would have your child.  Well, I don't know because it didn't happen.  There's no relationship to speak of.  No, this just happened two days ago. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, but you still know how you got along with her.  Yeah, but she gave me a fake email and a fake number.  So obviously, if she wanted to, this is not going to happen again.  And they also said, uh, yeah, this never happened.  But you said it on the air just now.  Right.  But, you know, I never said their, I don't know their last names.  I couldn't even find them on Facebook.  No one seems to have pictures.  She's not even wearing it.  Wait, did they say this never happened?  Wait, wait, wait.  Dr. Gay has something to say.  Well, I've been listening, and maybe they kept saying this never happened because Matt 
[03:50:00]  was just rolling around on the bed with himself, and they just kept telling him, look, this  is not happening.  He was just all fucked up and rubbing his dick in balls.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And sticking his two fingers on each hand up in the air, thinking something was going  on.  He was on all kinds of pills and booze.  Fucking blacked out.  And they're like, and you're sitting there going, I've never been in a three-way before.  And they're looking at you going, Matt, this never happened.  This probably happened in the back of a car, too.  It wasn't even in the house.  No.  He's just screaming. 
[03:50:30]  It's you in the backseat of a car, erect.  Yes.  Rubbing yourself, putting your two fingers up in the air, going, I love three-ways.  And they're like, looking at you in the backseat like, Jesus Christ, Matt, that never  happened.  They're just like driving them home.  Yeah.  We're just trying to get you home.  We're going to leave you at the bus stop or something.  As amusing as that is, no, it did happen at the house.  I don't believe it.  And it was very exciting.  Well, you say you don't remember cumming.  No, I, well, I definitely came in the morning because then she sucked my dick again and I  came on her face.  You did?  Partly on her face and partly in her mouth. 
[03:51:00]  Really, Tucker Max?  When I started cumming on her face.  Shut up.  Is this a little Tucker Max story?  No.  Travis.  Absolutely not.  Are we feeling Tucker Max-ish right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, it is starting to get to that point, isn't it?  Tucker Matt.  Tucker Matt.  You know what?  Honestly, I don't care if you're doing it or not because it happened and I'll never forget  it.  That's all you need.  For the next threesome, though, is to, is to fuck both of them and to fuck them in front  of each other.  That's the only thing.  You know what my goal for your next threesome is?  What?  To not hear about it because this is your last week and that's happy. 
[03:51:30]  Yay!  Yay!  Well, I mean, I thought they were trying to convince you, you seemed at the bar that  you said I have a chance that I could possibly stay.  Right, I was just saying that to them because I thought they might say you wanted to talk  to them.  Do you guys want to come back to my place in Zuccotti Park?  No, because they wouldn't bang you if they didn't think you might come back.  Like, if you were definitely not coming back, they wouldn't have banged you.  No, it had nothing to do with that.  Yeah, it did.  There's the whole thing.  And I did like how you were trying to get a drink out of one of the Hooters girl.  You're like, oh, well, da, da, da. 
[03:52:00]  Sam doesn't drink, so that's...  Yeah, I don't drink.  I swear you said that.  I was asked by 19 people.  14,000 people at FH Riley's asked me if I wanted a drink, and I said no.  And you didn't have one?  No.  He doesn't drink.  I don't drink.  Why?  What, are we going to get into the Sam Roberts story now?  I'm just wondering.  Because I don't.  That's not something I do.  There's lots of things I do and don't do.  Did you drink in college?  No, I never drank.  I've never drank.  If Carmel Anthony came up to you and said, Sam Roberts, I'm bleeding out.  He was like a basketball stupid.  I'm a big star.  I'm a big star.  I'd like to buy you a shot. 
[03:52:30]  You would say no?  That's probably a bridge that I'll cross when I get to it, Matt.  I don't think I need to make plans for that just today.  But who knows?  You know what I mean?  Life is long.  That'd be exciting.  It would be exciting.  Speaking of exciting, we were talking about interns on the show today at the beginning of it.  And we made the list of the top three.  And it was kind of a no-brainer.  It was Pat Duffy, who's known for his outlandish stunt work.  And he did things so remarkable that even Joe Rogan comes in here and brings him up out of the blue. 
[03:53:00]  Nobody will ever forget the things that Pat Duffy did.  Staple Gun?  Staple Gun.  Everything.  He was amazing.  We talked about Intern David.  That was one of the other top three.  And Intern David, to me, I mean, I'm sorry, Pat Duffy.  Intern David gets my number one spot.  You get number two.  I know other people will put you at number one.  That's a debate that will go on for all time.  And Jared the Fish Boy, a.k.a. Cream Pie Jones, ranked in at number three.  Now, David, we know, won't talk to us.  Pat Duffy, I just spoke to the other day. 
[03:53:30]  I texted Jared saying, will you call into the actor show?  Can I call you at 10 o'clock?  And remember how we were talking on the air about how, for some reason, these interns refuse to acknowledge the show?  Now, Pat Duffy will.  Pat Duffy calls in a couple weeks ago.  So, Pat Duffy is a good sport about the whole thing.  But Intern David and Intern Cream Pie Jones, Jared, refuse to acknowledge that they were part of the show.  So, I text him. 
[03:54:00]  And he says, I say, you know, I'll call you at 10.  Is that okay?  And he goes, no, I have to go to work.  And I go, well, you work in a restaurant.  I'll plug the restaurant.  Just call.  I'm going to call you at 10.  And he goes, well, why do you want me on?  And I said, because you made the top three interns today.  And he goes, funny, top stupid interns.  Otherwise, we'd be producers.  What?  So, he's still pretty pissed off about the whole thing.  And he responds, I'm not interested. 
[03:54:30]  Sorry.  I hope all is going well for you and Jess.  Have a Merry Christmas, though.  And that's the evidence right there.  For whatever reason, these interns want nothing to do with the show.  Now, listen, when you search intern Jared Opie and Anthony on Google, what you end up with is video results for intern Jared wearing a hat with shit in it, intern Jared picking up shit by the handful, intern Jared making a pube mustache with mayonnaise, and intern Jared starring in a mock Bukkake film. 
[03:55:00]  But remember, he had Brie Olsen, though.  Come on.  Yeah, and exactly.  For his birthday.  Listen, it's not all bad here.  First of all, he did all that stuff.  So, if you're going to do it, you're going to have to embrace it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Second of all, you guys know Brie Olsen, the porn star?  It's fucking hot.  Exactly.  Let's just say...  Nine and a half.  No, he got a good birthday gift from her.  Yeah, let's just say Jared the Fishboy got to know her quite intimately.  Something we'd all hope for. 
[03:55:30]  They were rolling around together.  He's shooting his fingers.  That's right, yeah.  Who wants a fingering?  Pew, pew, pew!  But, yeah, and see, look at this.  This is what I like.  Pat Duffy is on the after show.  What's up, Pat?  Hey, what's happening, man?  How disgusting is it for you to see Jared the Fishboy, Cream Pie Jones, and intern David just refusing to acknowledge that they were once a part of this great show?  Well, I mean, it's their own fault.  I mean, it's the only thing I ever used to gain any kind of notoriety anywhere. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  I mean, this is the thing.  Now, have you been listening to...  I know...  I can't remember.  Are you a fan of Intern Matt or no?  Intern Matt?  Oh, no, never.  Not at all.  No, not at all.  Have you...  Did you ever end up in any three-ways because of the show?  Never any three-ways, but I did have the most sex in my life using the paperwork that we used to do.  How is that?  Remember when we used to have the audience come in and I'd have them fill out all the paperwork?  Uh-huh. 
[03:56:30]  Well, if I was an attractive girl there, I'd take her phone number and then call it later on, and that used to get me late quite a bit.  So you wouldn't ask for the phone number.  You'd just take it off the paperwork.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'd just call them right there.  I'd go around the corner of the other room and just call them straight up.  Oh, and so then they'd be like, oh, that's so witty and charming.  You'd call me from the other side of the room, and then you'd bang them out.  Yeah, meanwhile, it's just creepy, and then I would never call them again.  Yeah, it really is creepy.  I mean, you're supposed to...  When you write your phone number down, you're entrusting that person to not be creepy with it, which is exactly what you were doing. 
[03:57:00]  Not only did they give me their phone number, they handed me their ID, and I made copies.  Oh, God.  So they didn't, like, when you called them from the other side of the room, they didn't think to themselves, oh, God, this is the guy I gave my ID to.  They thought to themselves, oh, that's so funny.  Yeah, oh, that's the guy on the show showing interest in me.  Yeah.  I'll let him put his dick in me.  Yeah, but listen, Sam, the reason I called you is because you're talking about Cream Pie Jones, and a couple months ago, he sent me an email. 
[03:57:30]  I guess you and him had some sort of falling out.  I don't know.  He used to do the Saturday night show when me and Dave were doing it, and he was just horrible.  And, I mean, we let him come in every week for, like, a year and a half, and every week...  And he had done two semesters of interning for O&A, and I swear to God, up until the last week he came in, it was as if it was his first day interning.  And so at one point, I just got frustrated.  That's not even surprising in the slightest.  Yeah, at one point, I just got frustrated and said, you're no longer the intern. 
[03:58:00]  You're just Eastside Dave's personal assistant.  So, Dave, you take care of it.  And I guess then Dave got fed up with him.  And I don't know if we had an actual falling out.  Why?  What did he say?  Well, he just sent me this, like, paragraph-long email about how he felt so used and strung along, and he thought any moment he was going to get hired.  And I was like, you're never going to get fucking hired by the Sam and Dave show.  Guess what?  Sam and Dave didn't get hired for the Sam and Dave show.  Exactly.  Well, just throw him a couple bones. 
[03:58:30]  He deserves it.  Yeah, really.  And Creepy Jones, I think it's everybody who, like, disowns the show has this attitude, like, if they just show up enough times, people will just do things for them.  It just happens for them.  They don't have any sort of thing in their head that says, I need to go out and take this.  I need to make this happen.  I need to prove nothing.  It's just, well, I was here for three months.  What do you mean you're not giving me anything?  Yeah, that's like a half a Pat Duffy approach. 
[03:59:00]  You just have to show up and do everything you can.  They just showed up.  Right, exactly.  And even the Pat Duffy approach really turns out it's not to work.  Well, of course.  I mean, in the end, it didn't work.  But that's regardless.  I had fun, Sam.  Thanks for making me think of it that way.  Yeah, I mean, I didn't know where we were.  But, yeah, you did have fun.  Okay.  And you're still famous, right?  Oh, absolutely.  So you could probably still get laid because of it.  And you'd be like, look at this video of me, you know, getting puked on. 
[03:59:30]  Well, no, more than likely because I randomly joined Twitter last week and I got like 1,500  followers overnight.  So I'm going to weed through those.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  What's your Twitter to all the ladies that would like to get a good banging from Pat Duffy?  Oh, yeah.  It's Pat fucking Duffy.  And you got the fucking in there.  Oh, of course.  You know, you got to be shocking.  You got to be over the top.  No G.  No, no, no.  Why would there be a G?  Exactly.  I just don't want people to follow the wrong Pat fucking Duffy.  We're being shocking, but we're also being cool and street. 
[04:00:00]  You know, it's Pat fucking Duffy.  Yeah, you know, you got to play to the kids, Sam.  I like that.  Well, intern Matt, I'm going to tell you this, Pat Duffy, Pat fucking Duffy on Twitter.  And I'm sure you know this deep down.  You know that this is intern Matt's last week and you know within two weeks, like by the  time we get back from Christmas break, we'll forget he ever existed.  Oh, absolutely.  There won't be any, hey, you remember intern Matt?  Because the answer would be no.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, Sam, you remember Hip Hop Ron?  Not really.  No, I don't.  I can't say I do. 
[04:00:30]  Neither do I.  Yeah.  But Pat Duffy, you will always live in infamy.  Oh, I know.  But like Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly right.  Thank you for calling in, buddy.  No problem, guys.  Have a good day.  You know, though?  It's Pat fucking Duffy on Twitter.  I had a great fucking time, no matter what.  Don't start using the F word and trying to get that Pat Duffy heat.  That's Pat Duffy's thing.  Cursing for no reason.  I had a great time.  Well, you know what could give you an even better time?  Is it some kind of silver?  That's right.  It's a super silver, Matt. 
[04:01:00]  Everybody knows Steven Singer is the best place in the country to buy a diamond.  That's where I bought.  Listen, I've purchased one, or I've purchased a handful of very, very small diamonds in my life.  The only place I'll go is Steven Singer.  Right.  Because you got to get some on the side, you know?  There's like one big diamond and there's stuff on the side.  You can't just have one either, right?  Right.  I mean, you got to keep going and getting diamond.  Steven Singer makes you a diamond expert.  But what a lot of people forget is that Steven Singer is also the best place to just buy a gift.  Sometimes it's not a diamond occasion, okay? 
[04:01:30]  Like, for instance, for my fiancée Jess, she got a diamond on the engagement ring.  Guess what?  There's a lot of non-diamond occasions following that one.  But Steven Singer is still the place to go.  Number one holiday gifts this season is super silver.  Yes!  You've heard us talking about Steven's newest item, super silver.  It's made with diamonds and argentium.  Damn.  What is argentium?  It's sterling silver on steroids.  It's legal, though.  Traditional sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver and mixed with copper to make it strong. 
[04:02:00]  But Steven Singer's super silver argentium is up to 96%.  Fuck.  Pure.  And it contains no copper, none of that bullshit.  Would you say it's like the Carmelo Anthony of silver?  That's right.  It is.  And Carmelo Anthony is a super player.  As a matter of fact, what makes Steven Singer super silver so super is unlike traditional sterling silver,  which tarnishes with exposure to air, super silver becomes whiter and brighter. 
[04:02:30]  It's as if it's magic, but it's not.  It's super.  So get her a gift, or him, gay fellas.  This holiday season from Steven Singer's super silver argentium collection.  Steven has the best gifts for you.  They're so special, he's going to make you look like a hero.  Oh, now I get the music.  Way to go, Steven.  Way to tie everything together.  Go online to IHateStevenSinger.com and check out his super silver collection.  This brand new collection starts at only $149. 
[04:03:00]  So cheap, even someone like me or intern Matt could afford it.  If you're in Philly, visit his store on the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  If you're not in Philly, go to Philly and visit his store on the other corner of 8th and Walnut because it's worth the trip.  Call him up.  888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER and have a personal shopper assist you.  Or don't get off your couch, you lazy schmuck.  Visit him online.  It is.  It's like an elf.  It's like the North Pole.  Steven Singer is the Santa Claus of jewelry. 
[04:03:30]  Hit him up online.  And he's got a hot wife, too.  Stop interrupting me.  Hit him up online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  That's IHateStevenSinger.com.  I'm assuming you're referring to Leanne, who's not his wife.  That's his assistant.  Oh.  However, she's very attractive.  And many times at the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  So go check her out, too.  I like how Matt just goes back to what he says.  And he's like,  Hey, call me Leanne.  Yeah, just shut up.  He already did the Carmelo Anthony thing, right?  He has his brain's like,  Say it.  Carmelo Anthony. 
[04:04:00]  Listen, that's about all the time we have for today.  I'm sorry that I have to leave you.  But luckily, Ron and Fez are coming up next.  So you'll have that to look forward to.
