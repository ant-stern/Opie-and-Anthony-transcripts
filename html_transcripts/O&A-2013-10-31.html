<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation before shifting to a celebratory discussion of the Boston Red Sox World Series victory, filled with profanity and anecdotes of drunken fans.  They then vehemently criticize the NFL's crackdown on taunting, referencing Leon Lett's infamous Super Bowl fumble.  The conversation turns to complaints about politically incorrect Halloween costumes and decorations, including examples of racially insensitive costumes and the perceived overreaction to minor offenses, with discussions about costume-free zones in schools and absurd neighbor disputes over decorations.  A caller shares a workplace sensitivity issue related to their last name. The segment concludes with discussion of Pamela Anderson's new haircut and a tease of an upcoming Scott and Todd prank call.  The entire segment is rife with profanity and offensive language.

The show continues with planning for a "Jocktober" wrap-up, involving playing old audio and potential physical assault of the hosts. They discuss graphic and shocking prank calls from Scott and Todd, involving cancer, death, and rape.  A significant portion focuses on a video of Guy Fieri and his hairdresser arguing, with speculation about their relationship.  The hosts’ commentary is heavily laced with vulgarity. A Steven Singer Jewelers commercial is interspersed with inappropriate jokes. A listener’s three-page letter complaining about General Mills' Monster Cereals' recipe change sparks a physical altercation involving Opie, Anthony, and Roland, a studio employee, resulting in a cereal fight.  Jimmy, one of the hosts, leaves early.  The segment concludes with continued discussion of the Fieri video and the cereal complaint, accompanied by Deep Purple's "Highway Star."

The show resumes with the aftermath of the cereal fight, showing five cereal boxes and a bag of Marshmallow Mades strewn across the studio.  The ensuing cleanup efforts dominate the segment, with interns struggling to vacuum the massive amount of cereal, and the pervasive smell of cereal noted repeatedly. Anthony is briefly absent using the restroom.  The cereal fight is explained as a reaction to a long and boring listener letter about cereal. Listeners call in, mocking Roland for not fighting back. Penn Jillette then arrives, discussing his experience on *Celebrity Apprentice*, his frustration at losing to Trace Adkins, his belief the show was rigged against him due to his criticism of Donald Trump, and listener reactions to his perceived betrayal. He details his crowdfunding campaign for "Director's Cut,"  including promotional videos featuring celebrity friends calling him an "asshole." He criticizes Criss Angel's magic and discusses Lance Burton's retirement, before detailing a new Penn and Teller act involving a cow disguised as a pygmy elephant.

The segment with Penn Jillette continues with Anthony teasing Opie about a perceived betrayal of Trace Adkins.  They discuss Penn's crowdfunding campaign. Penn provides a detailed commentary on Lou Reed's musical influence, citing specific songs and comparing him to Lenny Bruce. Opie then recounts a graphic anecdote about removing a bowel movement from his infant daughter's rectum, followed by a listener suggesting alternative methods.  Jim Jefferies calls in, discussing his Carnegie Hall show, his TV show (including casting George Lazenby and Carrie Fisher), Lazenby's anecdotes, his preference for practical effects over CGI, and getting a girl pregnant while drunk during filming. He compares his past partying habits to those of women. The show ends with Opie and Anthony reminiscing about past outrageous guest appearances (Justine Jolie, Shauna Lene), discussing Chris Brown, their Halloween plans, a teenager shot while toilet papering a principal's house, and a high-frequency tone audible to some but not all of the hosts.

Finally, the show covers the fallout from the listener's large cereal box delivery and the subsequent cereal fight between Opie and Roland.  The cleanup dominates the segment, highlighting the interns' struggles and Roland's anger.  The listener's letter about Count Chocula is discussed, along with reactions from other staff, including intern Tyler's inexperience with vacuuming. Penn Jillette’s reaction to the mess is mentioned, along with listener calls and discussion about intern Yuri (Jack/Don)'s name choices.  Advertisements for Russell Peters' Netflix special and Steven Singer Jewelers are included.  Strong profanity is used throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flesh you didn't.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  He doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, good morning everyone.  Hi.  Hi everybody.  Of course we gotta do something right off the bat here. 
[00:02:00]  Give me a moment.  Oh wow.  Right off the bat?  Right off the bat.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Socks go boom.  They went boom.  Playoffs now.  Oh, cool too.  Valentine fired.  Fans cheering loud.  Loud they were.  Fenway Park.  Big poppy.  Well, big poppy, yeah.  Play is back with Gomes and Napoli.  Pitching staff.  Yep. 
[00:02:30]  With letters K's.  Oh yeah, he was good.  And our bats go pow pow pow.  But there's one sound that we all know.  What's that?  Ow.  Oops.  Uh-huh.  Oops.  You got too excited.  I was drumming along.  Oh, and the DVD, the CD skipped.  You broke it.  Wow.  But we all know what it does.  What do the Socks say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  Oh, boy.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[00:03:00]  My drumming was good, too.  Should we start over?  Oh, boy.  You just got so excited.  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  Socks go boom.  Playoffs now.  Valentine fired.  Line fired, fans cheering loud, Fenway Park, Big Papi, play is back with Gomes and Napoli. 
[00:03:30]  Pitching staff with Leicester's K's and a Batsko pop.  No, stop.  That's the part where I like to drum, though.  No, pow, pow, but there's one sound that we all know.  We get so excited.  No, what does the Sox say?  Win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win win 
[00:04:00]  Red Sox.  I couldn't stay up.  I wanted to see the final out. 
[00:04:30]  I just can't stay up.  Yeah.  I actually watched it.  Did you?  Yeah, I forgot it was on.  And then I saw on the drug report, they said Boston is close to clinching.  I'm like, I got to watch the last couple of days.  I saw the big rally, and they were up, what, four zip or something.  I'm like, okay, this is done.  I made it to the fifth inning.  But I wanted to see the final out because it's the first time since 1918.  It's kind of a cool little historical thing.  Yeah, once they started really opening it up and just rallying, it was over.  So I watched some other shit. 
[00:05:00]  And then toward the end, yeah, I had to tune in and watch the big on-field celebration, I guess.  Yeah, I guess.  It's more than history.  You see this drunk kid that the news interviewed from Boston?  Oh, well, yeah, he's representing Boston.  Yeah, and very accurately, too, because they were crazy.  What do you expect?  This is what you're going to get.  That last out, what was that moment like when it actually happened?  You have no idea.  1918, it wasn't the same.  It wasn't the same.  Talk about being here for this moment. 
[00:05:30]  This is occasion.  This is history.  This is history, and I'll tell you what.  I was not alive during 1918, obviously, and this was more than fucking history.  Tell me a little bit more about what it was like in there.  When this happened.  I've been alive since 1988.  These guys are wasted.  This is the best time ever, because I've been watching the Sox since 88.  I've never seen the Sox.  In game six since now.  Okay.  Since now. 
[00:06:00]  We've got to say, we apologize for that.  We apologize.  Do you have to say it?  We've got to say it.  We've got to say it in the responsible ways that others are apologizing for that.  We've tried to do our best to not allow it.  We're so sorry.  We're not going to kill themselves.  Who is bothered by the word fuck at this point?  No one.  And if you are, whatever.  A weirdo would be bothered by that.  In that context.  If you are, you don't interview drunk 20-year-olds with the Red Sox winning.  Right.  If you're that sorry that the word fuck got out, you should have known not to put a mic  in front of that drunk. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Odds are they're going to say fuck.  Yeah.  And you see their eyes.  They're all glazed over.  Well, I wasn't around in 1918, but it was different then.  And the Sox fucking blew it out of the water.  Go Sox, go.  They did.  Congratulations, Boston.  Big Poppy.  They're not listening right now.  Maybe they'll hear this on the replay because they're all sleepy.  Big Poppy got MVP, eh?  God, he was an animal, right?  Well.  Very clutch. 
[00:07:00]  Very clutch, yes, as they call it, clutch.  They didn't really need his bat yesterday.  No, they were walking him a lot.  They walked him a lot.  I saw that.  Because he fucking, he's hitting in the series.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I tuned in.  And then right before they clinched, I put on the old Boston area police scanner.  Oh, did you?  And man, it was like a military operation.  They had so many cops, and they're talking about crowds that they're, they move the crowd 
[00:07:30]  around.  They divvy them up.  It seems like if you're in the middle of just chaos, you'd think like, all right, the  cops will just watch what's happening and make sure nothing bad really happens.  Sure.  But there's so much preemptive shit going on.  They divvy up the crowd.  They were saying like, all right, push that crowd over to this park area, and we'll close  off these two streets.  Make sure no one, these two crowds don't link up.  It was pretty, pretty cool to listen to.  So, yeah.  They know what they're doing, man. 
[00:08:00]  And then a lot of arrests were going on for intoxication and, yeah, and some vandalism  and stuff.  I guess they flipped over some cars.  You know, that seems to be the thing to do.  Well, when your team wins a championship, you got to do that.  You got to flip a few cars over.  You got to put them on fire.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, now that they got the World Series Cup, you know, you got to flip a car or two.  World Series Cup.  Here in Bofferson.  How's that hooten here?  Where is that clip, E-Rock? 
[00:08:30]  You know, as my tenure as mayor of this great city of Bofferson comes to a cause.  There goes the scurrying E-Rock down the hall to get the clip.  Thumping away.  He makes it look like he's running.  When you demand something from him, you go, where's that clip?  I can always feel him on this side of the wall running from that room.  He lumbers.  He really lumbers heavily.  A lumber.  It's very heavy.  It's a trotting.  He trods. 
[00:09:00]  He trudges.  He trudges.  He trods.  He lumbers.  He lumbers.  He's E-Rock.  And no sports curse, finally.  I finally have picked a winner.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, poor.  I had some guarantees over the years.  That didn't come, you know, through.  Yeah.  I got this one.  I told you people.  Yeah.  Oh, we got it right here.  The never-die Red Sox will play in the third World Series for the last nine years.  It's right here. 
[00:09:30]  I hope you enjoyed your trip.  The World Series Cup to Boston like we did in 2004 and 2007.  2004, 2007.  This Red Sox team plays with a lot of heart.  Heart.  Heart.  This Red Sox team played a lot of heart here in Boston.  Heart.  The pride we fear ever.  The never-die Red Sox will play in the third World Series for the last nine years. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Why don't we rootin' heart to be back?  Harley-hooten-heart.  Harley-hooten-heart.  Harley-hooten-heart.  Let me hear that part again.  Harley-hooten-heart.  The Red Sox team plays with a lot of heart.  Heart.  And some cold sometimes.  The never-die.  Harley-hooten-heart.  Red Sox will play in the third World Series for the last nine years.  Yes.  The World Series Cup to Boston like we did in 2004 and 2007. 
[00:10:30]  This Red Sox team plays with a lot of heart.  And some cold sometimes lukewarm.  Right.  Oh, God.  That means he's got to talk today, right?  I hope so.  It's got to happen.  What does Menino say?  That's the bit. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  That's the bit right there.  What does Menino say?  I don't know, no, no, no, no, no.  He is a marble-mouth old fucker, isn't he?  Yeah.  That's right.  So, there you go.  I guess that's today's show, because that's all that's happening.  Red Sox won the World Series.  Red Sox.  We could go home now.  Yeah.  That's it.  Good night, everybody.  Or we could move into the NFL thing.  Where's Travis?  What's going on there?  Well, what's going on is the NFL's not backing down from the Redskins thing. 
[00:11:30]  Uh-huh.  Which I like.  And they're trying to get this taunting rule passed.  Oh.  Taunting.  Who is bothered by taunting?  Yeah.  How many players are coming forward and saying, you've got to do something about this?  I'm so upset when someone taunts me.  Who are they doing this for?  I have no idea.  And don't say the fucking children.  Who are they doing this for, Travis?  I know in the NCAA, if you taunt like this, you know, this play from, which game was this? 
[00:12:00]  This was the Seattle game on Monday.  Yeah.  Okay.  Seattle.  Give us the details on this play.  I don't even know the play.  I mean, it was just a touchdown run and you start taunting.  He started taunting at like the 20 or the 15.  That's awesome.  He's waving goodbye as he's running the ball into the NFL.  That's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  As a sports fan, I love that.  Especially if it's two teams you don't give a fuck.  That's going to keep you interested when you see stuff like that. 
[00:12:30]  Sometimes it doesn't work out.  There have been clips.  Of course.  It's even better.  Leon Lett, one of the most famous.  Leon Lett in the Cowboys victory 20 years ago over the fucking, he's holding the ball out  and Don Beat just smacked it out of his hand before the.  The people that should, you know who should reprimand him is fucking like a coach.  Right.  Like say, what the fuck are you doing?  You could drop the ball.  But for the NFL to come forward?  If I was a coach, I would be all about just do more of that.  I love it.  You like that?  Yes.  Even if they drop the fucking ball? 
[00:13:00]  But who's crying over that shit?  The NFL.  It can't be the players.  Of course not the players.  Snow-filled field.  The NFL, where they know these guys are getting brain injuries.  But let's make sure they don't taunt when they run for a touchdown.  It's the same thing when they make ridiculous, you know, like you can't spin the ball.  Right.  That's a penalty.  Yeah, they're putting these guys in real danger.  Like later in their lives, they're going to have major fucking problems.  But let's make sure when they're, you know, when they make a really good play, they don't taunt. 
[00:13:30]  You know.  I guess the NCAA, though, if you do that shit, I didn't even know this.  They take the touchdown away, which is ridiculous.  And now they're hinting that the NFL might do just the same.  They're going to look at it.  They're going to look at it.  Yeah.  That's.  Yeah, that's kind of.  That was the wrong one, Sam.  Yeah.  Does anyone know why they're doing it?  I want to point out to the young lady that she hit the wrong Leon Lett drop in the ball clip. 
[00:14:00]  Does anyone know why they're doing this?  I don't know why, but I think it's just like, why not?  The NFL wants some weird classy league.  Fuck that shit.  Meanwhile, Brett Favre's talking about how he's worried about his memory.  Right.  And he's only, what, 45 years old?  45, and he completely forgot his daughter playing soccer.  And you notice the NFL didn't make a comment about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They ignored that, but let's get into this taunting issue.  Yeah, let's make sure people don't wave bye-bye as they're running for a touchdown.  You could get a conclusion of the brain. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, who does it bug so much that they're like, we got to do something?  And the other person goes, yeah, I agree.  Like, who gives a fuck?  I don't know.  It's this ridiculous society we live in now.  Because it really is like self-imposed.  It's not like there's some group saying, you know, like, this is mean.  Right.  Or something.  They're all men.  Every member of the San Francisco Fairy Marys is very upset.  I think even Troy, uh, Troy, Troykman.  Troykman.  I even, I think Troykman's okay with this, too.  Yeah, but I mean, Troy Aikman, we all know what he is. 
[00:15:00]  Troykman.  Do you want to apologize for that?  Troykman.  Wow.  Good old Troykman.  Oops.  So great.  Was that the clip?  Let me see that.  He's fucking running into the end zone.  Yeah.  See, you could get fucked if you do some of this stuff.  That's why this is great.  Oh, shit, I got this, motherfucker.  Fuck you.  Oh, man, is he lumbering down the field?  Fuck you.  He's like, where'd he come from?  Oh, come on.  And now he's trying to argue the call, like, wait a minute. 
[00:15:30]  I was just fucking around.  Got him on, like, the half-yard line, I think, right?  Dallas, had that not happened, they would have scored 59 points, which would have been the  most in Super Bowl history.  Oh, shit.  That cost them the fucking most points in Super Bowl history record.  Right.  Come on, ref, I'm going to look like an asshole.  Ref, you've got to help me here.  Although, is that the play?  I don't know.  It's one of them.  God, and he's had a few.  77, I think they have.  I love the old NFL films that we saw before with the smoke.  Ow.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Now he's on his feet.  Fucking idiot.  The play has been ruled as a fumble in the field of playing.  The fumble went forward through the end zone and out of the end zone, creating a touchback.  Buffalo's ball.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Embarrassing.  Does he look like.  But he slowed down to celebrate at the five-yard line.  And when he did, Don Beebe.  It's let time, baby.  Stripped it away.  Baby is the fastest Buffalo Bill. 
[00:16:30]  And what if he had just run all the way, would have had the touchdowns.  He's already solid.  Oh, that is a close call right at the goal line.  Yes, it was.  And Leon left it.  He's kind of acting like, where'd he come from?  The sideline?  He couldn't have caught me.  In fairness to Lett, he might have made it from that angle.  It looks like the ball might have.  That's hilarious.  It's great.  It's more than just a fumble.  He must have just licked.  Yes.  He must have just licked that ball. 
[00:17:00]  I'm going to swat that right out of your hand.  And that was such a cowboy fucking trouncing.  It probably was unnecessary to taunt when you're fucking 52 to 17.  You just look mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me go to the phones.  We're trying to get the answer.  Who the fuck is bothered by taunting?  In a football game, especially.  German, it says.  It's Jermaine.  How are you doing?  Yeah, all right.  Well, they spelled German.  The goddamn German's got nothing to do with it. 
[00:17:30]  What's up, buddy?  You're calling from Long Island.  Yeah.  What I found out from TV is the NFL is just looking at their sponsors.  You know, they get big bucks for things like the Super Bowl for those commercials.  Right.  And it's more of a business decision for the NFL,  thinking that the stupid talking that goes on in a pro football game could actually hurt  their business that way.  That's funny.  That's great.  But, you know, but they all know, you know, this old gag, but they all know, you know, 
[00:18:00]  what happens when people drink beers.  Right.  Yeah.  But let's ignore the downside of that, right?  Yeah.  The drunk driving accidents don't seem to deter their fucking business decisions.  And of course, you don't think that Red Sox fan would taunt anybody in that inebriated  state?  Oh, come on.  He's great.  Fuck.  I want my sports to look like that.  Taunting.  I don't like sportsmanship.  Yeah.  Nice little handshake every once in a while.  That's fine.  But fuck. 
[00:18:30]  Say how great you are.  And how great you did.  That's big business for you.  Big pump.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  All right.  Punch it out.  Take care, guys.  So that's, that hit yesterday.  That clips everywhere.  Bunch of fucking.  Yeah, like there's already a penalty for taunting, but it's, it's enforced after the  touchdown.  They don't take the touchdown away.  To take a touchdown away.  What are you talking about?  That's crazy.  The guy, the guy scored. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It doesn't matter how he scored.  If, if he was following the actual rules, you're going to make some weird rule that they  have to now follow.  That could be the worst penalty in football.  Like that would be the worst thing possible.  Worse than any fucking yardage penalties or fucking, like they're taking away points.  They're, yeah.  These guys get really excited when they make an amazing play.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they gotta, they, you know.  And they're not too bright.  You gotta, you know.  You gotta.  You want people to control their emotions in a situation like that. 
[00:19:30]  That's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  I mean, we've already lost great touchdown celebrations.  I know, man.  That was fun.  Yeah.  Of course it was.  Have those guys look like idiots.  Yeah.  And you would laugh.  I think it's the fans excited.  Like, fans are going nuts when somebody's about to score a touchdown.  This guy agrees with the NFL.  Come on.  All right.  Greg in Georgia, go ahead.  Yes.  Uh, I agree with the NFL.  I think, uh, Tony is a form of bullying. 
[00:20:00]  And, uh...  Bullying.  There's no way.  Bullying on the football field.  I think he's right.  That's like, yeah.  Do you agree, Greg?  I do.  I like to recruit football fun.  Ugh.  I just want to hug everybody.  Football fun.  They're pretty much hitting each other and hurting each other.  Right.  But that's bullying.  Yes, they're killing each other on the field.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Greg, you're obviously bullshitting us.  Yeah.  No, one other thing.  Oh, here it comes.  PUNKUS!  You're falling crapped out, guy.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  You just fuck it.  I'm punching out.  I'm going to punch out your fucking mother.  No taunting before you get hit so hard you end up with brain damage later in life.  Yeah.  That's why.  It's ridiculous.  The NFL got away with murder when they had that payoff.  They paid, what, $700 million?  They said that was like a joke to get all that brain shit to go away for a while.  Yeah.  I mean, none of those players are going to remember getting that money anyway. 
[00:21:00]  Exactly.  Don't start eating it.  Let's talk to Brett Favre.  Which way did he go?  Which way did he go?  He's all fucked up.  Chunks of his fucking life.  Did he get hit that much as a quarterback?  Sure.  Fuck yeah.  He was an Iron Man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was one of those hittable quarterbacks.  Yeah.  He would rarely miss a game, obviously.  And he wouldn't come out of a lot of games.  Not the prima donna types that fucking, you know.  Right.  You know, not to hit. 
[00:21:30]  They're fragile.  But what did he say recently?  He doesn't remember his daughter playing soccer?  Playing soccer, yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, I remember playing this sport or that.  It's like, but that soccer thing, I remember like maybe one game.  But in all fairness.  But then I found out she was on a team and fucking played a shitload.  In all fairness, it's soccer though.  Yeah, really.  Not that memorable.  Yeah, it's true.  Maybe he's just blaming bad parents.  Girls soccer.  Girls soccer.  Not memorable.  They got kids just running around.  They don't know what the fuck they're doing.  He also sent out a photo of his genitals with shower shoes in it. 
[00:22:00]  That's true.  Now we understand.  I bet he doesn't remember that.  Yeah, but people don't let him forget that one.  No.  No.  That was embarrassing.  Sure was.  Oh boy.  Well, happy Halloween everybody.  Yeah.  It is Halloween.  Yeah, that means sitting on the couch, trying to, you know, have a nice afternoon and being 
[00:22:30]  interrupted every fucking couple of minutes by the doorbell ringing.  Just don't answer the door.  You can't.  Then they fuck your house up.  Do what I used to do when I lived in Huntington.  You just turn off all the lights.  That's another thing.  You turn off all the lights and we used to turn the TV in such a way that you can't even  see the TV that is on through the windows.  That doesn't work.  I didn't want to deal with it.  They come up to the door.  They know I'm in there.  Just leave the bin outside with one of those.  Yeah, man.  You know what?  If it was just kids from my neighborhood, I would do that. 
[00:23:00]  But you know what they do?  The blacks?  Yes.  There are certain more, let's just say, underprivileged, of course, areas of Long Island and around the  area that I live in Nassau County.  And the parents, I guess, or parent, whatever, grandma, whatever, tends to drive to these  more lucrative areas. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, but we used to do the exact same thing.  We would find the rich neighborhoods.  Yeah, so when we were growing up, you remember, right?  We'd go to Hidden Lake.  Oh, I know.  I hear you.  We would go to a couple towns over knowing that it was a little better.  And if someone was stupid enough to leave all their candy out and you were one of the  first to get there, it didn't matter what color you were.  I was taking it.  Especially if they had good shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like Smarties.  Smarties.  I like Smarties, though.  You picked a bad one. 
[00:24:00]  Smarties hurt.  I like Smarties.  They make the back of your mouth hurt.  No, you don't bite them.  You just kind of bite them.  You let them dissolve.  Come on, everyone knows that.  Taking the entire bin is not a race thing.  I don't think so at all.  That's a teenager thing.  You take the stool that the bin is on.  You just take everything.  I can only go by what I've seen.  And I knew whenever I would see one of those take one bins, as I'm walking up, I'm like,  well, there's no candy in here.  And there was never candy in there.  Of course.  It was already gone.  Of course.  Never first to the scene.  So then, of course, you've got to egg the shit out of their house. 
[00:24:30]  Of course.  For not taking care of you properly.  Well, I don't like feeling like I have to take a bunch of candy and pick it out and  throw it in their bag.  So I just kind of hold out a thing, a big bowl thing, and let them pick.  And, of course, I've conveyed this story in the past of how this young African-American  child literally took his arm, like, put his forearm in the candy and just swiped into  his bag. 
[00:25:00]  Nice.  I think I was robbed.  And he swiped, like, half the candy with his forearm into his bag.  And I got to stand there and go, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I don't think that's a black thing.  I was like Barneys.  Yeah.  I had to call the cops.  Now, old man Kumi is upset about Halloween and what blacks have done to Halloween.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a fist-shaking motherfucker on Halloween.  It's so funny you mention Halloween. 
[00:25:30]  So, my kid's not going to school today.  And this is the reason.  I just got a reminder email.  And I'm going to read it word for word.  Uh-oh.  From the school?  Dear parents, happy Halloween.  Oh, that's nice.  This is a friendly reminder that Blank School is a costume-free zone.  Ew.  This is what I'm dealing with.  So, please, save those great costumes for trick-or-treating later this evening. 
[00:26:00]  All the best.  What an unfun fucking country to try to get into.  All the best.  So, that's why my kid is not going to school today.  I'm not doing that to him.  He knows today's Halloween.  And he knows, you know, he's going to be trick-or-treating.  And he can't wait to put his fucking costume on.  Costume-free zone.  A costume-free zone.  A fun-free zone.  And I've talked to the parents, and no one is into this.  No.  They're like, why the fuck are they doing this?  And don't throw that religious holiday shit at us, because no one acknowledges that Halloween's 
[00:26:30]  actually a religious holiday.  No one thinks that.  No one thinks that anymore.  It's just supposed to be fun.  More costume controversy on the news.  Oh, that's Bob Pottery Barn, probably.  Those cowards.  What's this big problem?  It looks like they were dressed up as the Jamaican bobsled team.  No, the Jamaican bobsled team, yeah.  Oh, the Pottery Barn had one.  They had a sushi chef outfit.  Just the outfit that's a sushi chef.  Right.  And one that was like a kimono.  And they were called racist by an Asian-American group, so they discontinued them. 
[00:27:00]  Of course they did.  And there's another story I was reading about insensitivity.  I guess at a hospital, they were having a little party, and somebody dressed as Obama, with  an Obama mask.  It was like, it wasn't blackface or anything.  It was an Obama mask, and put him in a straitjacket.  And they deemed that insensitive, and told every staff member in the hospital that they  then had to attend diversity training. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm not kidding.  Diversity training.  I don't know.  Meanwhile, it was the mental hospital guys that were with the Obama in the straitjacket  were two black guys.  So it was like, what's this diversity thing?  Well, yeah, but that's racist, though.  It's so racist.  It's cool if Bush has a Nazi hat on.  Right.  But don't.  You could dress like a Hitler Bush.  It's unbelievable.  That was fine.  Eventually, all our kids are just going to be walking up to houses in their regular clothes.  Yes.  Sure.  Yeah.  You dressed up as someone about to get a kiss. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, God.  Hi.  Happy Halloween here at Dave Herman's house.  You're going to get a prize.  I think his lawyer is speaking out.  We've got to find out.  Oh, that lawyer.  Yeah.  Can you get that?  The excuse is retarded.  I got a second part to this.  So I was talking to someone in my building about what I just read to you.  Yeah.  That's the reminder.  But we've known for a while.  You can't have your kid go to school with costumes today.  And then the guy just started telling me some of the dirt and some of the fucking assholes 
[00:28:30]  that live in my building.  There's a lady that complained to this guy.  It's not even his job.  Is she sure?  All that glitters is gold.  There's a lady.  Oh, very good.  Shit, I should have got that one.  But I guess somebody put Halloween decorations on their door.  Uh-oh.  And she lives on the same floor.  Yeah.  And she goes, you know, that's illegal.  You're not supposed to have anything on your door.  And then she goes, are they going to do that for every holiday? 
[00:29:00]  That's not right.  I need to talk to someone about this.  How old is she?  I don't know.  He didn't give me an age, but I know this much.  She doesn't have kids, obviously.  So she's bothered by this family that has, obviously, kids inside, and they put a couple  dumb Halloween, you know, decorations on the door.  And I'm sure it's just basic shit, maybe a pumpkin or something.  I don't think they went over the top.  And she's losing her mind over that.  She's a cunt.  Yeah.  She's a cunt.  And no one says, too bad that you're upset.  Yeah.  Live with it.  But I told this guy, go watch. 
[00:29:30]  A memo's coming soon that, you know, they're going to remind people that you can't have decorations  on your door, because like we always say, the minority fucking rules.  Well, we respect everyone's individuality.  Yeah.  And then he told me about it.  We really don't.  He told me about another lady.  He goes, she had a leak in her apartment.  So we're trying to figure out where the leak was.  Yeah.  Kelly?  Nice.  She had a leak?  So she went and did it.  So the guy's like, is the leak in the master bedroom or, I don't know, whatever, the other 
[00:30:00]  bedroom?  Yeah.  She goes, I would really appreciate it if you don't say master bedroom anymore to me.  What?  Because that brings us back to slavery.  Ah, come on.  The time when there were masters.  Is it a black woman or is she just a white lady?  I did not ask that.  I assumed it wasn't a black lady, by the way.  Massa.  A Massa bedroom.  That's what I call mine.  So she has a problem with the term master bedroom.  That's crazy.  People are losing their fucking minds. 
[00:30:30]  You live in a crazy building.  I don't know if it's crazy.  I think it's, we could take calls right now.  I guess master's degree, she should probably have a problem with that.  They should change that.  I'm not the master of anything.  Yeah.  Well, I think they actually did change the, you know how you can slave together?  Yep.  Things like hard drives and whatnot.  They changed that because they didn't like the word slave being used.  It's fucking astounding.  Language police.  It's, it's, it may, it, like when I hear this, I feel it from the bottom of my throat to my 
[00:31:00]  stomach.  Like, it's, it's a physical reaction.  Where the cum goes.  Not on my face and in my hair.  It makes me so angry.  It's like sometimes I don't want to be, I just can't be funny.  I just want to just yell dirty things.  I just can't believe it.  I can't believe this shit is real stuff.  And it's become, it's the norm now.  Like, we got, we got a letter from my daughter's school saying that she could dress up for Halloween.  I know.  And, and I shouldn't be actually surprised when I get that letter.  Right.  You know, but I was.  Yeah.  Because I was expecting her not to be. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  But no one speaks.  How do you, how do you tell a three-year-old he can't go to school in a costume?  That's ridiculous.  Because you know how excited everyone in my daughter's class is.  Right.  They don't know.  To dress up for Halloween.  It was always so much fun.  Think back, you know, going to school when you were a kid, dressing up.  Oh, it was great.  And if the one kid doesn't dress up.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Guess what?  The parent has, has to talk about it.  Yeah.  With their kid.  Let the kid feel after that.  What are you going to do with the kid in the wheelchair?  Nobody can use their legs at school.  We have somebody who's in a wheelchair.  So everyone has to hobble around or crawl on your stomachs. 
[00:32:00]  Enough already.  There was a story in, in Park Slope last year.  Oh, God.  They got to change that name.  That sounds more like, that sounds more like a mean order.  I always notice they can't park.  Where a bunch of parents, a bunch of parents wanted the, the ice cream trucks to stop coming around.  Because they didn't want to have to deal with their kids not being able to get ice cream.  They didn't want to have, have to tell their kids, no, you can't have ice cream right now.  So no one should have ice cream. 
[00:32:30]  Because they can't take responsibility.  Because nobody wants to tell no one.  Nobody wants to say no.  They can't be responsible enough to say, no, you can't have ice cream right now.  Can, can they just, maybe, teach, maybe?  Yeah.  Just like, like schools.  How about schools teach?  Hey, there you go.  There's a novel fucking idea.  Instead of wasting so much energy on, on this political correctness bullshit, how about we, we put kids through school so when they pop out the other end, they could actually read cursive.  It's, I heard they're not teaching cursive anymore. 
[00:33:00]  Did you hear that?  Someone told me that they are not teaching cursive anymore.  I've heard that.  It's the dumbest thing ever.  What, cursive or?  Yeah.  I don't know what they need.  I'm just saying that they're not teaching.  It's a discipline thing.  It's a mental discipline.  I've been block printing my ass off ever since I was a little kid.  I write cursive, but not well.  Like, I'm sloppy.  No one, no one does it well.  It's faster, though.  I write in calligraphy.  That's what I do.  It takes 20 minutes per letter.  I like to put heart over my eyes.  I read an article about, like, how people aren't going to be signing their names.  I know, I wrote the article. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah, oh.  That's good.  Go ahead, sorry.  People aren't going to be signing their names eventually.  You know, if you're not learning cursive, how are you going to sign your name?  Oh.  Big X.  Plus, you won't need it with, you know, fucking fingerprint phones.  Who are you?  Boop.  Oh, okay.  That's you.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Hello.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, my last name is Koon.  C-O-O-N.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, exactly.  And at work, everybody's last name is on their mailboxes, except for mine. 
[00:34:00]  Somebody complained, and now they used my first name.  First name is nigger.  No, his first name is Amma.  And they can't call me, my nickname is Koon Dog, but they can't call me that at work anymore.  But it's your name.  Well, Jesus.  That's how bad it is.  What you should do.  That's fucking funny.  Is you should, but dude, why don't you complain and say that you want the same treatment as the 
[00:34:30]  other employee?  Yeah.  Right.  Because people take this shit.  Equality.  Nobody speaks up.  Yeah, I speak up, but what are you going to do?  It's a big company, you know?  Yeah, that's my last name.  Need the fucking job.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, no, I don't want to see you get fired, but I mean, there's a way to speak up.  Yeah, that's true.  I don't want to see you get fired.  They make child pornography props.  Hey, punch it out, guys.  Have a good one.  Sure you are.  See ya. 
[00:35:00]  All right, Koon.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Jersey.  Tommy.  Tommy.  How's it going, guys?  Boy, I'm a little tired.  I work for a school, and we have these workshops, and they showed us this one game called Ah So  Co, and an Asian group complained, so they had to change the name.  Because Ah So?  Ah So Co.  Ah So Co.  Hmm.  I don't understand it anymore.  You're just showing the world you're, like, weaker when you speak up about some of this  shit. 
[00:35:30]  I said some of it, because, you know, maybe case-by-case basis, but you just show, like,  you're a weak person.  Yeah.  I think it's bad for any group to be represented by somebody that presents themselves as so  oversensitive and weak and fucking they can't handle it.  Right.  It's attention-seeking.  It's, it's, it's, it's people feeling a little powerful in the moment.  Right, right.  Look at me.  It's all self-interest and self-serving and insincere shit.  Uh, Doug in New York, what's up?  You're happy that kids can't wear costumes at school?  Absolutely. 
[00:36:00]  Okay.  Uh, because I remember as a kid, I would wear a costume and my costume wasn't as, you know,  kids are a bunch of jerks.  So, screw it.  No costume.  I don't want these kids to have any fun at all.  I love fanning this stuff.  Hmm.  I go to the meetings with the other parents and there's always a parent who's like, let  the kids have this thing, let them have fun.  I'm like, no, no fun.  Nothing.  No cell phones, no costumes, no playing. 
[00:36:30]  Well, are you kidding or are you serious?  Of course he's kidding.  I'm absolutely serious.  So, are you just coming from a baby boy, I'm jealous that they have what I don't point  of view?  I bet.  About half of it, yeah.  Because I'm like, school is work.  I don't want them to do anything.  I want them to sit there.  I don't believe you.  You're bullshit.  You're bullshit.  Yeah, you gotta do a better job.  Only because somebody who's that much of a twat isn't, wouldn't say it that way, they  would give themselves other reasons.  And plus, if you're that way with your own kid, then what a cunt you are. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, what an asshole.  You got your own kid in there and you're taking out your fucking child as, I didn't get  what I wanted, vengeance on him?  I don't believe this guy.  Yeah.  Nah.  Wow.  Master bedroom, though.  Oh, just, it's endless.  Decorations on a lousy door.  Who cares?  Nobody has the discussion.  As soon as you open your apartment door, there you go.  You don't have to deal with the rest of the world.  Right.  So who gives a fuck?  You're in a building, so you're pretty isolated to begin with. 
[00:37:30]  But that little voice where everybody would go, ah, that guy's an asshole.  That person is now, oh, we're sorry.  Like, everyone just is afraid of controversy or any conflict there.  Like, Pottery Barn is embarrassing to pull those.  What happened?  I don't even know.  Two costumes, not at all races.  One is a sushi chef.  Um, and it had, like, the Japanese flag on it or whatever.  It's a costume representing that, and one is a, uh, kimono.  And the Asian group complained, and they pulled him.  They're banning all kinds of, uh, workplaces, all over the place. 
[00:38:00]  They're banning any type of ethnic, um, costumes.  So you, you can't.  And then I heard, like, cowboys and Indians.  Like, like, the Indian one, you could say maybe.  But why the cowboy?  Yeah, cowboy is not based on color or race or ethnicity.  It's, it's an identity.  It's not a race.  I don't know what they want.  They want a bunch of fucking Frankensteins.  Because nobody, nobody has the fucking discussion for real.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:38:30]  They just go, why are we doing that?  And they go, well, we think it's best.  Oh, okay.  I was afraid of standing out in a negative way and being ostracized.  I don't want to be the racist.  Because we've all watched people have their careers and their lives ruined  and were being called racist or insensitive.  I'm glad they just checked my Twitter.  Kingston Pete, who's a good, good guy on the, on Twitter.  He writes, it's black and orange day at my kid's school today.  Oh, is that what they call it?  They're not even calling it Halloween.  Oh, you know what today is?  That's not, that's not happening.  You know what today is at Sirius XM?  What?  It's the October fall gathering. 
[00:39:00]  No, no, it isn't.  At one o'clock.  Where, where, where?  Here.  Lobby.  Stop it.  In the lobby.  Let me find the, let me find the actual wording for you.  Why not Halloween?  So it's happening right here in front of our eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  Why isn't it called Halloween?  It's just.  They canceled the day because you're acknowledging it is Halloween.  You're just changing the name and then it makes it okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  October employee gathering.  Come celebrate candy, the fall, and the company.  Oh my God.  Oh my God. 
[00:39:30]  It's happening right here in front of our eyes.  You are invited, and that's not everybody.  This is for me.  You are invited to an employee gathering on Thursday, October 31st.  Come have a quick bite and Halloween treats.  Oh, no.  Oh, they said Halloween treats.  Halloween treats.  Uh-huh.  All right.  It's not a Halloween party.  They're just serving Halloween treats.  Right.  It's the October employee gathering.  That's ridiculous.  They'll have another employee gathering to celebrate the winter in December. 
[00:40:00]  Right, right.  That's what they do.  The winter gathering.  Right.  Oh, did you hear the last line?  Sam is fired.  This is a great opportunity to get together with your co-workers and scare or surprise your  co-workers with your costume.  Oh, see.  So they want you to dress up.  We should scare some people.  That's good.  I saw a guy walking around with a progeria kid costume the other day. 
[00:40:30]  It's funny.  It's very funny.  Did we used to work with him?  Yes.  Oh, I know who you're talking about.  Of course.  Remember him?  Yeah, he's the oldest progeria kid in the world.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  I'm just a regular kid.  You know how easy that would be for him?  To be a progeria kid?  Oh, yeah.  For the fall what?  The fall gathering.  The October employee gathering to celebrate fall, candy, and the company. 
[00:41:00]  The gathering of the dilladoes.  Fucking.  What is that?  What meeting was held for the wording of that?  We're all guilty, man.  We can't put a Halloween party.  We're all guilty.  We're allowing this shit.  Oh, man.  It must have been a bunch of meetings.  I will accept no responsibility.  I have been yelling and screaming about it and twittering about it, and that's all you  can do is speak up.  You can't make it happen. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  I accept zero responsibility for this fucking dog shit state we're in.  So, I guess we're supposed to all be the exact same person eventually, right?  Is that where we're heading?  But no, but they, like they say, they stress diversity and individuality.  That's all bullshit.  But they don't want it.  Yeah, it's bullshit.  Complete bullshit.  I don't just, I just don't know what the basis is.  Like, is it a legal thing?  No.  It accompanies.  It accompanies.  Yeah.  Or maybe even a school.  You know what?  That might be it.  Some parent, some fucking parent probably sued. 
[00:42:00]  They didn't want to tell their kid, hey, we're uptight, or we're Jehovah's Witnesses,  and we don't believe in God, or whatever it was.  Right, right, right.  And no school wants to deal with the legality of it.  It all comes down to lawsuits and legal bullshit.  You're right.  That's the whole push of where we're going is legalities.  Nonsense by lawyers.  Another guy, we don't have to go to him on the phone, but at his daughter's school,  it's called the Harvest Party.  Oh.  A Harvest Party.  A Hargis Party.  Yeah.  It's always fun. 
[00:42:30]  And leave your pants at the door.  Creep.  Why can't you just put out an email saying, hey, man, today...  Happy Halloween.  I want to remind people, today is Halloween, and I also want to remind you that kids will  be showing up in costumes, so if you're one of these lame-ass fucking parents that  don't want your kid in a costume, you might want to keep them home today.  Stay home.  Why?  Why?  Because it's one kid.  It's two kids, maybe. 
[00:43:00]  So the whole classroom has to suffer?  The whole school has to suffer?  And anybody who gets made fun of for having a shitty Halloween costume gets made fun of  for having shitty clothes every other day of the year.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to say the T-H in clothes.  Yeah.  Clothes.  No, you don't say clothes.  You say clothes?  Clothes?  Clothes.  That's how the word is spelled.  Oh, no.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of things are spelled.  How do you say clothes?  Clothes.  Just clothes.  You don't say clothes.  You say clothes.  No, you don't.  No.  From cloth.  No one says clothes.  Maybe if you're called London.  Clothes.  Clothes. 
[00:43:30]  Costume.  Yeah.  Clothes.  Beak.  Beak.  It's like you don't say, uh, dowkey.  You say douche.  Yes.  Very good.  Clothes.  Clothes is what you do to a door.  Do you say often?  Yeah.  Often.  You're not supposed to.  Often.  Yes, you are.  It's a silent T.  Often.  It's not silent.  It is silent.  It is often.  Often.  Absolutely.  Often is not.  Often.  Do you say psoriasis?  That is a silent P.  You say psychology.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The T is not silent and often.  How do you say human? 
[00:44:00]  Human.  How should I say it?  You should say it like Kirk.  Newman.  Yeah.  Some people like to say human.  Human.  Human or something like that.  Yeah.  They fuck it up a little bit.  There's an H there that won't be ignored.  Word.  Hey, uh, before we go to break, I just, I just tweeted the picture of Pamela Anderson.  What the fuck is going on?  She decided to go for the pixie cut.  That all, it's all the rave with some of the young girls like herself, the young, the  young girls, but boy, but all she had was her sex appeal. 
[00:44:30]  So what the fuck is she doing?  Well, that's been appealing away over the fucking, over the years.  You're right.  She is.  I swear.  I thought I was in the paper for a second.  Oh, no.  For a second.  I'm like, oh, wow.  We're back in the paper.  It's been a while.  Where'd I go?  That's Pamela Anderson.  Yeah.  She looks like a boy.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Big, giant tits.  It's horrible.  It's the sensible haircut we talk about where, you know, something happens with you ladies 
[00:45:00]  and you just completely give up.  That's a Miley Cyrus thing.  She saw Miley Cyrus do it.  Like, that's young and it feels fresh and new.  Miley Cyrus is so much younger.  On a broad her age, though, that's that kind of that, you know, oh, it's just so much easier  in the shower.  You know, we've talked about this over the years, how women, they're married, they get  a little older, and then they just decide to fucking look exactly like their husbands.  They just cut their fucking hair off, start wearing, like, stuff that isn't the least 
[00:45:30]  bit sexy, because it's all convenient that way.  Oh, I'd rather wear some comfortable shoes and pants and, you know, cut my hair short  so I don't spend so much time in the shower.  And then the guy turns around and goes, I'm married to my friend fucking Bob.  I remember the bit.  Of course.  I like that bit.  Yeah.  You gotta keep trying.  Oh, come on.  Especially if you're married, you gotta keep trying.  And the guys do, too.  You can't just assume that, you know, you don't have to worry about shit anymore.  The ladies get all mad at this. 
[00:46:00]  It's like, no, the guys have to also.  You can't turn into a fat piece of shit.  We just know what happens to the ladies.  Yeah, yeah.  That's our perspective.  I'm sure the ladies can call up and give their perspective.  You gotta stay in shape.  You gotta eat your pussy.  You gotta be a good guy.  But we all know they're chicken shits and they don't call our show.  The pussy is just the gateway to the ass, I say.  Attaboy, Ant.  That's what I say to it, too.  As I'm looking at pussy, I'll go, you're just the gateway to the ass.  I point at it angrily.  It's a gateway drug like pot.  So there you go.  Pamela Anderson in the paper today cut all her hair off. 
[00:46:30]  That's crazy.  She's no kid anymore.  You can't do that.  Although the big, wacky head of hair doesn't look good on an old broad either.  What do you do?  That big, long head of gray hair.  You gotta do a little in between.  Put a reggae hat on.  I like a white leather reggae hat.  You like it?  Like fucking Sway?  Yeah, I guess.  Wear a big Sway Jiffy Pop hat.  How do they keep their heads up?  I don't know.  I've always wondered that.  That is kind of like, whoa. 
[00:47:00]  That's a lot of weight after a while, I think.  Has anyone ever seen Sway without his hat on?  No.  Did he wear his hat when he was interviewing Obama?  Obama?  Oh, yeah.  With his look, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's kind of disrespectful, isn't it?  No, not if it's your look.  No?  Not if it's Sway.  Really?  You're not in a church.  He's an entertainer.  If you're in the KKK, you can wear your hood.  Well, you should be able to answer that.  See, there you go.  He did.  He's wearing his fucking hat.  Yeah, but he put a stylish one on.  Yeah, but you shouldn't be able to wear that hat. 
[00:47:30]  He's in the fucking White House.  We cut his shit.  He used to, like...  Wow.  That used to be his hair.  Jesus.  You know, his hat.  His head looks like Alien head.  Like, from Alien.  With that big hat.  That's so funny, the way things end up.  Now we just see him walking down the hall, wave.  Hey, Sway, how you doing?  Yeah, Sway's cool.  Sway.  I remember when they brought him on.  Sway's one of the cool ones here.  When they brought him on MTV initially, it was like,  What the fuck?  Because you had Kurt Loder.  And it's like, I'm Kurt Loder.  Here's the MTV news. 
[00:48:00]  And then it'd be like, yeah, I'm Sway!  Hear the shit that's going down, nigga!  It was like, what the fuck?  But it worked.  He's really respected, too.  Oh, absolutely.  He's been on MTV forever.  I like Sway.  He's a good guy.  He's still on, right?  Yeah.  How long has he been on?  Since we were in high school.  15 years, at least.  Oh, wow.  Damn!  Since we were all in high school, you're right.  Yeah, I remember.  I meant weed.  It's about time you had made it.  That was the we.  I'd be like, God damn, yeah, I gotta get out of gym early because I want to catch Sway. 
[00:48:30]  That's right.  What?  Is that what you would say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were seniors.  You guys were freshmen.  What?  That's right.  But we weren't all in high school when Sway hit MTV.  Bullying you guys.  You guys are out of your minds.  Yeah.  Like, you are.  That was fucking...  We gotta take a break.  I have one announcement.  I don't know if the Jocktober thing's gonna happen today.  What?  And I'll tell you why.  Uh-oh.  Because he's gotta leave.  Wait, I have to leave at like 7.20.  I have an early shoot day today. 
[00:49:00]  Lay for you now.  I don't know if at least start it when we get back then?  I'd love to start it.  Give him a little taste.  At least listen to the...  Today's the last day of Jocktober, and on the last day of Jocktober for the new fans  of Jocktober, we beat the living shit out of ourselves.  We turned it around on ourselves.  Right.  For something we did in the past.  Let's start it when we come back.  I do it.  I gotta hear a little bit.  Yeah, it's fine.  I'm trying.  I'm gonna miss it.  Do we have to take a break?  We have a new...  No, I don't want you to miss it.  That's why I'm...  Why don't I just do it?  Huh?  Fuck the break, then.  Yeah, no, because it could be at least an hour.  Yeah.  It could be, right? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I got an idea.  I'm thinking maybe...  Scott and Todd phone call by Hilarious Pranks.  Oh, you know what?  By Todd Pettengill.  What?  Funny Pranks.  Yeah, there's a bonus disc.  What?  For Jocktober that we have to do before we do O&A.  What is it?  It's a Scott and Todd prank call that I've been saving.  Wow.  It's gold.  Wow, you've been sitting on it?  So why don't we do that next with Jimmy?  And this is what I suggest, and I'm gonna hate myself.  for suggesting this, because we would have got away easy today, that you invite some 
[00:50:00]  of the, you know, the boys in.  Okay.  For the beating.  Okay.  That's true.  So maybe we do it on Monday.  Okay.  We could.  We're out of October, obviously, but who gives a fuck?  Doesn't matter.  But we'll wrap up Jocktober nice on Monday with some douchey audio from our past.  And rather not rush it.  And then some of the guys could come in and just, you know, have their way with us.  Colin.  I'm sure Bobby would love to be a part of it.  That's a good idea.  And of course, you've got to get Rich Voss. 
[00:50:30]  So when it gets really ugly, then we could fucking attack him.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  Well, we can't handle it anymore.  We'll go right after Rich Voss.  Get away, John!  All right.  Yeah, the Todd Pettengill prank calls, though, are just different than what we used to hear.  I sort of know what you're getting at.  I got it over here.  Oh, you have it, though.  All right.  So we'll do it after the break.  All right?  Yeah.  There's a new feature, though.  Huh?  This is called Craig's Conundrums. 
[00:51:00]  Which is correct to say the yolk of the egg is white or the yolk of the egg is are white.  The yolk of the egg is white or the yolk of the eggs are white.  Shake about it.

We never have to go anywhere, eh?  No.  No, we don't.  We just never have to go anywhere anymore.  What happened?  I don't know.  I want to have to go somewhere.  How cool would that be?  I know.  Guys, I'd rather stay here until 10 and then go after...  I wish you could, Jimmy.  I hate leaving early.  I know. 
[00:55:00]  You know me.  Yes.  Wow, there's a lot of tracks on this bonus Jocktober.  Ooh, nice.  Uh, uh, so what's going on here?  Well, this is...  What's going on?  This is some special Scott and Todd parodies.  And, uh, I mean, prank phone calls.  Prank.  Parodies?  Phone scams.  Phone scams.  Yeah.  That we didn't get to.  You've been phone scammed again.  Oh, that's great.  But we have to make believe you didn't say parody?  No, no, no, because I was getting confused with parody song.  Oh.  Is that it? 
[00:55:30]  Bullshit.  Scott and Todd parody.  Scott and Todd phone scams.  Scott and Todd wore the roses.  Oh, of course, Sam.  You lying sack of shit.  I don't lie.  I'm an honest dude.  Oh, man.  You are.  You look good on shaving.  Thank you.  Bobby Kelly doesn't like that.  Appreciate that.  Doesn't like when he started growing fucking facial hair like a man.  So what do we do?  We just hit play.  Just hit, just like Aerosmith says.  Just push play.  So these are real phone scams from, uh...  From the Scott and Todd, the big show with Scott and Todd. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Hello?  Hey, is this Mr. J?  Yes.  This is Dr.  Dr. McFeely boobs.  Yes?  Your medical results came back.  Yes?  You have cancer of the testicles, brain, and lungs.  What? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh!  That's terrible.  This was, I think, that was Wednesday's show.  Wow.  They're getting a little edgier.  It was a little fast.  They're listening to us.  They're getting a little edgy.  Wow.  A little fast prank.  That absolutely sounds like a real prank call for once.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Right, it was, I think.  Yeah, it was very genuine.  That Dr. McFeely boobs doesn't have a good bedside manner.  Yeah, funny name.  Phone side manner, whatever.  I don't want to congratulate Troy Kwan for officially being back on our radio show. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, that was not...  What?  Why did he call Troy?  Huh?  You mean back on Scott and Todd's show?  Is that who he pranked?  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Right.  I hope everything's okay with his health.  We have another prank call?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Another phone scam?  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello, is this Mrs...  Yes?  This is Professor Poppinkooky from the school.  Yes?  I got a call because a drunk driver hit your child and killed him.  Oh, my God! 
[00:57:30]  Oh, we're finally laughing.  Oh, now these are good phone scams.  That was from the middle of October.  I've been saving that one.  Wow, you sat on that one for a while.  Nice.  Damn.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, another one.  Hello?  Hello, is this Mr...  Yes?  Yes?  This is police officer Booby McCoppergun. 
[00:58:00]  Yes?  Your wife was raped and hit with a brick.  Oh, my God!  Oh, I'm in a little Hickaboo.  Now, I'm in a little Hickaboo.  Chippa-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe.  I'm in a little Hickaboo.  Now, I'm in a little Hickaboo.  Chippa-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe.  Jesus.  Yeah, they've been mixing it up over it.  Wow.  I don't know.  They're taking a whole new tack with this thing.  It's amazing.  It's like you want to make fun of them, but they've got to...  Yeah, they're really bringing it to them.  Yeah.  Finally.  We got one more.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Hello?  Is this furniture store?  Yes, it is.  Put the manager on.  Excuse me?  Put the manager on, tough guy.  Hold on.  Hello?  Yeah, this is Mr. Couch Potato Sofa Fuchs.  Can I help you?  Yeah, you can help me there, turkey.  I bought a sofa, and my baby crawled on it, and it closed on him, and he died.  Oh, oh my god. 
[00:59:00]  Wow, they're really mixing it up over there now.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  And they used to be, you know, four and a half minutes.  Now they're down to about 40 seconds.  Down real quick.  Getting right to the point.  Yes.  I like the goofy names.  That's my favorite part of any phone scams.  That was the one part of the formula that wasn't broken.  You're right.  The wacky name.  You look at them and laugh all along when they hear the name.  They are right off the bat with the name, you know. 
[00:59:30]  I know we're going to play some of our audio from the past just to give the people a taste  and Jocktober, and then we're going to really do it on Monday when we can have some of the  guys in to beat the shit out of us.  Yeah.  But I can't ignore the Guy Fieri fight.  Is Guy Fieri gay?  What the hell's going on?  Gay Fieri.  Why would he fight with a hairdresser?  His, not a hairdresser.  His hairdresser.  But?  It's his hairdresser.  He's having a fight.  I don't know if you, I don't know.  I gotta say, if you've got a hairdresser, that's a bit mysterious. 
[01:00:00]  If you travel with a guy, it's a little weird.  It's a bit mysterious if you have a hairdresser, period.  Guy travels with him.  Hey dude, all he does is fucking spike it up with some shit.  It's all you need to do.  Right.  It's not a woman that needs, you know, this fucking lustrous hair.  It's not like it's like long and curly.  Yeah.  You can just do it yourself.  And maybe brown or something.  Right, right.  You know, that's the type of hairdresser you don't really need a hairdresser for.  Where you gotta maybe touch up the grays a lot.  Right.  You know? 
[01:00:30]  You know.  The color makes a difference.  Perm it.  Make the wig look good.  Yeah, yeah.  Get the wig in place.  Right.  Wig glue carrier guy.  Right.  You're not talking about guy.  I'm just saying.  Any random dude.  I'm just doing random dudes with hairdressers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which I always found very strange.  Yeah.  But especially Guy Fieri.  That's an easy do.  Uh-huh.  Because, I mean, obviously he gives it that rock and roll color.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's up to Guy Fieri to just spike it out.  But you're not gonna need.  Why would you need a hairdresser for that? 
[01:01:00]  You don't need a hairdresser there to maybe touch up your color at a moment's notice.  Right.  Go to your hairdresser with pictures of Smash Mouth.  Yeah.  Is he married with this guy?  Yeah, he met his son.  He sounds cool.  Trevor or Trent or Tracker or fucking, he's got one of those names.  Uh-huh.  Troy.  I don't know.  All right, guys.  I gotta go.  You're not gonna hear the audio.  No, I'll listen to it.  You're not gonna hear the audio.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'll listen to it.  You want a little taste? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  And I'm at the Deacon tomorrow night with Dice, if you are so inclined.  Yes.  Yes.  Probably have about 80 tickets left.  That's it?  Yeah, that's a good check.  Oh.  If it wasn't after Halloween, we'd be so good.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but it will be sold out.  That's great.  Boobs are great.  I don't care how old you are.  Guys like looking at boobs.  I'm sorry, ladies.  Even gay guys like looking at boobs.  Who is that?  My mom.  It's true.  It reminds them of mom.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Who's that guy?  Holy shit.  Who's that guy? 
[01:02:00]  Why?  Guys like looking at boobs.  That's good.  You know who I think that might be?  What?  I think that might be the opster.  Wait, I thought it was a chick.  Oh, my God.  I thought I was, for some reason, I didn't remember the whole time where I was doing a radio with  a girl partner.  What happened?  This lady's like, get over it.  Grow up.  When I'm 60, I hope I continue to talk about boobs.  When?  IAF, what do you got?  Who do you guys?  I'm curious.  Late 20s.  Why? 
[01:02:30]  Audio from 1997.  Remember when I said I hate leaving early?  Oh, my God.  1997.  Late 20s.  Late 20s.  Why?  That's about right.  What are you fucking asking, lady?  That's about right.  You were younger than I am now in 1997.  Yeah, yeah.  Late 20s, man.  That could be 26.  Hey, idiot.  They weren't going to hire old guys at a station that's called the only station that really 
[01:03:00]  rocks.  Yeah, so they hired two young mavericks from New York coming up.  That's right.  Up and comers.  You guys are like radio prodigies.  I don't think I can do this.  That's hilarious.  Please save it for me, Monday.  I feel like you just brought in a girl with great big meaty pussy lips.  Yeah.  She's showing them and I have to leave.  Wonderful.  And Anthony, how old are you?  Yeah, I'm still in my teens, but you know, I'm with it.  Bye, guys.  Take it easy, Jimmy. 
[01:03:30]  I'll see you tomorrow.  Yes.  So that's going to be the end of Jocktober.  We're going to do it on Monday.  Yeah.  Oh, is that a good one?  Wow.  What a taste.  That's a taste.  That's a taste.  That's a good taste.  I need mouthwash.  You know what?  I don't remember that.  I don't either.  I have no recollection of fucking saying that.  And this is going to be a special one because there's that taste.  Yeah.  And then I have, from that era, an Opie bit and an Anthony bit.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, I hate these. 
[01:04:00]  Why don't we do Jocktober?  I know.  I know.  We just got to survive one day out of the month.  Oh, gosh.  All right.  So we'll do that on Monday.  Monday.  We'll wrap up Jocktober on Monday.  Yeah.  With this audio from the past.  You're saying it's from 97.  Yeah.  When you guys were in your 20s?  Late 20s.  Late 20s.  Yeah.  Late 20s.  That's about right.  That's not.  You're out defensive, too.  Late 20s.  Why?  What's the matter? 
[01:04:30]  No follow-up questions, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Don't ask anything about a year born or...  Right.  Why?  What am I doing wrong where you don't believe I'm in my late 20s?  Why?  It's such late 20s, it's oozed right into the 30s.  Right.  Oh, man.  Why?  So what's going on with Guy Fieri and this hairdresser?  He got into a big fight with them, so I guess they were coming from San Francisco.  International Air... 
[01:05:00]  San Francisco.  Right.  It has all the features.  All of them.  He's just traveling with his hairdresser from San Francisco, and they're drinking on the  plane, supposedly.  They were drinking, and they used a car service to take them home.  Commercial flight.  They used a car service to take them home.  It appears to be that way, but I'm not positive.  This is all a legend, I guess.  Man, I do have a guy that cuts my hair.  I can't imagine a scenario where I'm going to be punching it out with the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:05:30]  Can you come up with a scenario where you would be punching out the guy that cuts your  hair?  No.  No.  No.  Roland is saying that he thinks it was a private plane.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Which is even more like...  Private's plane.  Private.  Private's plane where you can show your privates.  You can show your privates.  Yeah.  Other men can touch them.  So then I guess they ended up getting into a fight, and I think Guy Fieri is in this  car.  Okay.  And the hairdresser's outside of it.  Okay.  So here's the...  Who taped this? 
[01:06:00]  Just the passerby?  The paps.  Oh, the paparazzi?  Paparazzi.  The paparazzi was following them?  Well, they were right outside the airport, so it was probably like, you know...  Okay.  Had the paparazzi chill at the airport waiting for celebs to come into town.  Celeb.  I'm going to watch this cold.  I actually didn't click on this one.  I haven't seen it yet, either.  Okay.  I'm a fucking dickhead, man.  You fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck you. 
[01:06:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  Is that his hairdresser yelling?  Yeah.  Passionately.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  So his hairdresser was very upset there, it seemed.  What could he possibly be upset about?  That is really upset.  He was passionately upset at him.  Yes.  What did Guy Fieri go, hey, man, I'm going to save some money and go to Supercuts. 
[01:07:00]  I'm sorry.  Just do all I need to do is go to Supercuts.  I don't need you.  I hear that he squirted some vodka down his throat with a squeeze bottle.  Yeah.  I could see where they would be pissed off then.  Oh, Sam Roberts comment?  I could understand the...  Sam didn't act like a little bitch.  No.  Damn.  Well, kind of.  I got an apology.  But not a full-out bitch, but you're a little bitch.  Could I hear him again?  I want to hear this impassioned fuck you from his hairdresser. 
[01:07:30]  Guy Fieri's hairdresser.  Guy Fieri's hairdresser.  Why is he still...  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  That is something very personal.  Yeah.  And then he runs away going...  He's like...  Did he hear Guy Fieri with an ow? 
[01:08:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  That's like a...  It sounds like a betrayal.  Yes.  Yes.  A betrayal.  That sounds like a betrayal.  That isn't like...  Maybe he stiffed him on a tip or something, guys.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  On a private plane that they were flying together.  You're probably stiffed him.  He probably did his hair...  He probably did stiff him.  While they were flying, and he said, you know what?  Oh, boy.  I'm not going to tip you as much.  That doesn't sound like, hey, I left my fucking conditioner in the hotel room, so I'm not 
[01:08:30]  going to be able to condition my hair.  Fuck you, you dickhead.  Fuck you.  Even Guy saying, I'm going to start using another hairdresser wouldn't have that kind of reaction.  What is TMZ saying?  What is TMZ saying?  Do dish.  Nothing yet.  No?  Any speculating?  A rep from Guy tells TMZ, a bunch of guys were messing around.  Things got a little out of hand, but they're all good now.  A bunch of guys.  It's always rock and roll.  You know...  What is that rock and roll covering up? 
[01:09:00]  You know what happens when guys talk about chicks?  That's right.  They get mad at each other when talking about chicks.  Hey, Harvey, never seen dudes being dudes before?  Weeping while calling someone a dickhead.  Right.  Fuck you!  Saying, fuck you?  Wow.  Weeping.  He was weeping.  There's some weeping going on there.  Yeah, it was...  Well, I'm just going to...  No one wants to speculate.  I'm just going to speculate.  They were having gay sex.  Right?  And, uh... 
[01:09:30]  It's pure speculation.  It's just speculation.  Okay.  Based on what I'm seeing right here.  Okay.  I can put together that they have been, uh, uh, homosexual lovers for years.  Right.  So you're saying that's the kind of fight that somebody would get into after somebody  says, I no longer want to have gay sex with you.  Because I'm now having gay sex with another man.  And that's the type of reaction you would get from the guy you'd been having gay sex.  And that guy just found out?  Right. 
[01:10:00]  Just replace the guy with a girl.  And then a lot of us can relate to this scenario.  Oh, hell yeah.  Can we get Guy Fieri on the phone?  Oh, boy.  He's a friend of the show.  I don't see why not.  I'm sure he'll take our call today.  Yes.  Yes.  Because this is all...  He'll explain.  I'm sure he's got a good explanation.  All right.  Cool.  Call up the homo and let's...  But then that guy runs away like...  He really did run away in a tiff.  A huff.  That's right.  Can we hear it again?  We ran off like he was drunk and just found out his gay lover told me he was having gay 
[01:10:30]  sex with another man.  With another man.  That's how he ran, I'm saying.  Yes.  Let's hear this again.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  That's his voice. 
[01:11:00]  And then Guy Fieri slams the door.  That's telling.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I can't believe I trust this fucking asshole.  Oh, I can't believe we've been having gay sex for so long and he runs off like that at  the airport.  That's a very interesting theory you present, Ann.  I didn't even...  It's just my theory, but I'm basing it on my own personal assessment of the video.  I don't know, but that's what I say.  Justin Stengel just texted one theory, maybe he lost his comb.  He could have.  That would get a hairdresser very upset. 
[01:11:30]  That's his job.  True.  True.  Although, this sounds more emotional, and I think the gay sex theory has more emotion  in it than the comb theory does.  It does.  It does.  You would get that high-pitched, kind of a crying, sounding like a bitch girlfriend  sound.  Well, let's get Guy on the phone to...  Let's get Guy.  ...straighten his shit.  I mean, to give his side of the story.  Yeah.  Probably don't want to straighten it out.  Right.  It's nothing to do with this situation. 
[01:12:00]  So, in your theory, then...  Yeah, my theory.  Would you think that since that guy is a little more whiny...  Uh-huh.  ...a little more submissive, even...  Right.  ...that Guy would be the top?  Guy?  Based on this video, Guy is the top.  Yes.  This guy has spent their entire gay relationship together as the sloppy party bottom.  Yes.  Oh.  He's the guy that needs the towel after they're done.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he gives it to him good.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:12:30]  Based on my speculation of this video, from what I've seen...  Yes.  ...I am coming up with a theory.  Yes.  Not based in fact.  Just my theory based on this.  Guy comes all over this guy.  Yes.  Uh, well, a lot of tweets coming in.  Oh.  Uh, Guy's barber.  It's a hairdresser.  A barber.  Sounds like Jill Nicolini, Bernie Anthony stuff.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like Boogie Nights just came in.  And what was that based on, right?  Betrayal.  Heterosexual relationship between heterosexuals. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  But betrayal.  Uh-huh.  The word there is betrayal.  And what...  Supposedly they were drinking all night long on a plane.  That's...  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Drinking private plane.  With your hairdresser.  With your hairdresser.  Fuck.  Who, when he gets upset, gets real whiny and bitchy.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Little Boogie Nights.  Yeah.  All night.  Yeah.  Come on.  Faster.  Faster.  Fucking jerking, jerking.  Look, I can't do it with you talking. 
[01:13:30]  Shut up.  This is rock and roll, so a guy would be into this.  Rock and roll.  Yeah, something tells me, just based on my own theory of the video we just watched.  Yeah.  That the whiny, cryy guy just got ditched.  Just got dumped by his gay lover.  Of at least six months, if not longer.  Six months.  That's a relationship anger. 
[01:14:00]  That isn't just some whore anger.  A one-night stand, let's say, anger.  You fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  Listen to that.  Fuck.  Yeah, there's a problem.  Can we play Right Said Fred over this, too?  Oh, God.  A little Right Said Fred.  You got some Right Said Fred, maybe?  I'm too sexy for my shit. 
[01:14:30]  Let's see how it sounds with some Right Said Fred.  All right, let's play it again.  Yeah.  Let's try to figure this out.  Yeah.  We're going to try to figure this one out.  Yeah.  You fucking dickhead.  You fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  See, I think he was suggesting, I think Guy was suggesting, I mean, the hairdresser was 
[01:15:00]  probably suggesting, based on my own theory.  Speculation.  Was speculating.  He got a little out of his zone as a hairdresser and started getting into Guy's zone as a cook.  Guy didn't like it.  Because that guy suggested a new steak dish called Meat Spin.  Oh.  Yeah.  And he wanted to demonstrate it for Guy.  And Guy wasn't into it at that moment. 
[01:15:30]  He's in a fucking limo.  He just got off the plane.  He's drinking.  So keep it for the house.  He wanted to give him a tube steak sandwich.  Exactly.  Right.  I understand.  Yes.  Yes.  Fuck you.  And then he goes, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Why isn't Guy calling our show?  I don't know.  Man, when he needs to promote, he's right there.  Oh, rocking and rolling.  He's got to do one for us today.  Explain this shit.  Come on.  Apparently we're getting no answer from him.  No answer?  What?  Damn.  Wow. 
[01:16:00]  So you're not saying, you don't think one night stand here.  No, no.  I'm not thinking one night stand.  I'm thinking personally, based on my own assessment of this situation.  Long term relationship.  Something tells me.  That went bad during the flight?  Yeah.  Not only in cooking does Guy Fieri like to leave the bone in.  You know what I mean?  Right?  Right.  Yes.  Right.  Right.  Yes.  Just juvenile.  And then he just tries to say, it's just, guys being guys. 
[01:16:30]  Just guys being guys.  You understand.  We've gone on a lot of road trips, right, Ope?  With the guys, the comics.  What?  We had the tour, right?  Sure.  Was there any moment where any of the comics maybe was leaning in one of the vehicles,  crying, yelling, fuck you?  Not really.  Yeah, yeah.  I was thinking of Bob Kelly when he broke his knee.  But, you know, there's a guy.  Even that wasn't as bad as Guy Fieri. 
[01:17:00]  Those are guy moments.  And he wasn't angry at anybody.  Right.  No.  I'm just thinking of someone that was crying out.  That's the only one I can think of that ever happened.  Uh-huh.  But what's Guy's quote again?  Well, Guy's people.  Guy's people.  He's peeps.  They reached out to TMZ.  Yeah, yeah.  They said, hey, TMZ.  Hey.  Bunch of guys were messing around.  Things got a little out of hand, but they're all good now.  It's all good now.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[01:17:30]  As he pranced away.  Screaming.  Screaming.  From Guy Fieri.  I've been in some situations over the years, you know, fights and whatnot, but I've never  like pranced away going, woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Isn't it more like, you motherfucker!  Yeah, yeah.  I'm coming to get you!  You dickhead.  You dickhead.  Fuck you!  Woo!  The hairdresser's name is Ariel Ramirez.  Uh-oh.  That's mysterious. 
[01:18:00]  Uh-oh.  That's fucking...  That is mysterious.  I don't know.  I don't get that hairdresser thing.  You think it's the whole thing.  It's just a lot of mystery surrounding it.  Look, you know...  Carlos Danger.  Well, we're on TV once every five years.  Uh...  Sure.  We'll get someone to fool around with the hair a little bit.  Oh.  Make sure we look TV-ready.  Sure.  But to have someone doing your hair on a regular basis, that's just fucking...  That's...  That's not...  Mysterious.  That's not guy shit.  No.  And I mean just guy shit. 
[01:18:30]  Just being a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really isn't.  Isn't that a little coincidental, too?  His first name?  Guy.  Guy.  Hey, what are you into?  You know what?  Guy.  Yeah.  Replace one of the letters and you know what you get.  I do.  Oh my God.  I do.  Uh-huh.  All right, yeah.  Let's play it over this music.  All right.  Let me...  Wait, you know what?  No.  To be fair, because guys are guys, man.  Let's play it with some rockin' song. 
[01:19:00]  Like some...  I don't know.  Deep Purple.  Or like...  Oh, man.  Or even like...  Like Sabbath.  What's a really good...  Highway Star, Deep Purple.  All right.  Let's do Highway Star.  That's...  Just to be fair.  That's an old school rocker.  And then we'll try It's Raining Men.  Yeah.  Because we're trying to figure this shit out.  Yeah, maybe we're not hearing it in the proper context.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  So let's hear this...  Deep Purple.  Yeah, this is a guy's song.  All right.  Now play it.  Fuck, you dickhead. 
[01:19:30]  You fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rocks.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Fuck you.  This is a very fast beat.  If a guy is thrusting to the music...  I was just thinking, if you want to tear up another man's ass...  Right.  You'd play this.  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, dress.  I love him.  I forgot we were talking about Guy Fieri.  This song is so fucking good.  Turn it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you want to feel all right, hold tight, I'm a highway star. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  How old did you guys say you were in 97?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Late 20s.  Late 20s.  Late 20s.  Yeah.  I discovered this.  Because my dad liked this classic rock stage when I was growing up.  All right, hold tight, I'm a highway star. 
[01:21:00]  We got a box of shit that just entered the studio.  What is it?  What is it?  Kenny's frowning.  Awesome.  Why is it awesome?  Why is Kenny frowning? 
[01:21:30]  What happened to this?  A bunch of three-page letters.  Cereal?  A three-page letter.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, man.  Fruit Brute.  All right.  What'd you count chocula?  Blueberry.  Oh, my God.  Lucky Charms.  I love Lucky Charms.  I'll sign the Lucky Charms.  Hey, there's a Star Wars pen inside.  I want that.  Why do we got a...  Count chocula.  What's going on?  Blueberry.  Why all the cereal?  We got like 12 boxes of cereal.  How many?  One, two, three... 
[01:22:00]  Chocolate...  Chocolate marshmallow...  Marshmallow...  What is that one?  I don't know.  Someone give us a bunch of...  That's that ghetto-ass cereal in a bag.  That is.  Cereal in a bag.  Just says ghetto.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...  About 12 boxes of cereal.  Mama can't afford the box.  What kind of cereal?  It's all the monster cereal.  So it's Blueberry and Count Chocula and Frankenberry and Fruity Yummy Mummy.  Fruit Brute, too.  And Fruit Brute, yeah.  Fruit Brute's like the wolf ham. 
[01:22:30]  Do they have any peanut butter in there?  No peanut butter.  Fruit Brute.  I heard that was the nickname for a celebrity chef.  Oh, my God.  You didn't go there.  I don't know which one.  Oh, my...  It's a three-page letter that's typed out.  For what?  Who wants to read this?  The cereal thing?  Happy Halloween, Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  Love you.  Love the show.  Of course you do.  Every year at Halloween, General Mills re-releases the monster cereals.  Count Chocula, Frankenberry, and Blueberry. 
[01:23:00]  Admiral Mills.  For a limited time.  This year, they've also resurrected two long-requested perennial favorites that have been retired from the lineup for decades.  Fruit Brute, formerly Fruit Brute.  What?  It is still Fruit Brute.  Yeah.  It just doesn't have that weird line over the...  Why?  What?  Formally Fruit Brute.  Fruit Brute, formerly Fruit Brute, he writes.  All right.  And Fruity Yummy Mummy. 
[01:23:30]  Too much fanfare.  I do believe Eric Stoltz was eating Fruit Brute in Pulp Fiction when John Travolta called him.  Remember he was watching TV and eating cereal?  I think that's right.  I think he was eating Fruit Brute.  Okay.  What is Fruit Brute?  A little trivia for you.  Which one's Fruit Brute?  This is it.  It's cherry flavored.  Artificial cherry flavored frosted cereal with spooky fun marshmallows.  Sounds delicious.  I don't remember Fruit Brute.  Well, I know.  Sam glommed two boxes already.  It wasn't a thrush to him.  He's pulling him out of there.  Yeah, it's all right.  You get last dibs. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, man.  He wants Count Chocula.  What'd you grab?  Boy, you like Count Chocula, huh?  I love Count Chocula.  Yeah, huh?  Well, all right.  What about Iraq?  Cereal leader, Iraq?  Let me read.  I still got 20 minutes to read.  Oh, right.  That's true.  I forgot about that.  Those of us who are children of the 80s and 70s, even.  I guess he's older than us.  I remember, like, Frankenberry commercials in Count Chocula.  Yeah.  Look forward to their annual appearance with great nostalgia and childlike delight as we  seek to re-experience, ever so briefly, one of the joys of our childhood. 
[01:24:30]  That's the first paragraph of a three-page letter.  But when we, as adults, taste one or all of our favorite monster cereals of yesteryear,  the reaction is almost always the same.  They don't taste like I remember them.  Oh, man.  I remember loving these as a kid.  I guess my tastes have changed.  I don't enjoy these like I did when I was younger.  Do people really think this hard about cereal?  No.  No. 
[01:25:00]  Thank you.  Most adults who have this experience, upon tasting the modern-day incarnations of the  monster cereals, keep it to themselves and just forget about it.  It's because they've taken out all those delicious carcinogens that we used to gobble up as children.  And forget about it.  I cannot.  I will not.  Wow.  Capital letters.  I can't.  I can't.  I won't.  It is my intention to cry foul, expose General Mills' deception in attempting to pass off  these cheap inversions and call upon them to restore the monster cereals to their original 
[01:25:30]  former glory.  Oh.  I have no idea.  What is this deception I speak of, good sirs?  Yeah.  One simple word.  Corn.  Corn syrup instead of sugar?  When the monster cereals were first introduced in the 70s, the primary green ingredient was  oats.  Actually, oat flour.  Oh.  Creating a delicious cereal with a perfect texture for accompaniment by Marshmallow Bits. 
[01:26:00]  Think flavored versions of Lucky Charms.  Obviously, the government's in this conspiracy to change our childhood cereals.  Thank you for your service.  Regardless of which flavor was your favorite, the original oat-based versions had a texture  and mouth feel that made the cereal delicious.  Does this guy have anything more important to do than talk about?  Ready?  Oh, boy.  Page two. 
[01:26:30]  Fast forward to the 21st century, and General Mills has placed profit above quality and quietly  altered the recipe, replacing the oat flour with a much cheaper, both in cost and quality,  and more prolific grain, corn.  Oh.  Oh.  Anyone else notice that my reading's gotten a lot better since having kids?  Wow.  No mistakes.  Thank you, Sam.  I have to read a lot nowadays.  Getting that fucking muscle back working.  The corn-based incarnations of the monster cereals taste nothing like their namesakes from days 
[01:27:00]  gone by, and only serve to sully the memory of the oat-based originals by having a texture  not unlike shellacked styrofoam.  Wow.  What?  General Mills' deception runs even deeper, as they also released the corn-based monster  cereals this year in retro packaging from the 70s and 80s, available exclusively at Target.  What branch of the military is General Mills? 
[01:27:30]  Very important.  Now, while I absolutely love the concept of the limited edition...  Limited edition!  Limited edition!  Linder longer!  Get your Lucky Charms box in its original packaging!  He actually wrote that.  Yeah.  Uh, retro boxes.  They only serve to deepen the disappointment when the contents of the box are nothing like  the classic box art conjures.  And a direct quote from the same press release, bring in Fruit Brute and Fruity Yummy Mummy 
[01:28:00]  out of retirement this year.  General Mills' marketing manager for the monster cereals, Ari Zanudin, is quoted as saying,  We choose the current flavors of Fruity Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute to be as close as possible  to the original flavors while taking into consideration consumers' preferences with consumers can get  a taste for what these cereals were like when they were originally on shelves.  Was he at a podium with a bunch of microphones from the news in front of him when he made  that important cereal statement? 
[01:28:30]  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The original Fruit Brute, which ran from 1974 to 1984, and Fruity Yummy Mummy, which ran  from 1987 to 1993, were both generically fruit-flavored cereals.  Is this what those congressional hearings were about yesterday?  I thought it was the healthcare thing, but I think it was about the controversy of the old  school blueberry and the new Fruity Yummy Mummy.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Stop reading.  But no, I can't.  General Mills obviously felt that re-releasing two cereals that had essentially the same flavor 
[01:29:00]  profile, though Fruity Yummy Mummy touted vanilla marshmallows...  They touted?  ...would be counterproductive and relaunched the expansion monster cereals with completely  different flavors, assigning cherry flavor to the reintroduced Fruit Brute and an orange  vanilla cream flavor to Fruity Yummy Mummy.  What are you talking about?  Now, I will say this.  You've already said enough.  The two new flavor profiles of the reintroduced Fruit Brute and Fruity Yummy Mummy are actually 
[01:29:30]  pretty decent.  Ick benign Fruity Mummy.  He's giving a fucking speech.  Right.  Now, that having been said, the corn-based texture of the cereal component makes all five of  the monster cereals completely inedible.  And I have sent the enclosed samples...  Okay, now we get to the part of why he sent this to us.  And I've sent the enclosed samples to you guys to see if you, as fellow breakfast cereal  aficionados, agree with my assessment.  So, I see one says Frosted Toasted Oat Cereal. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  So that's the good stuff.  I guess.  We're with Kellogg's.  We're not with General Mills.  Oh, shit.  I'm over here now.  With Kellogg's.  You may also be wondering why there are two additional cereals included with the monster  cereals.  I was fucking...  That was really getting to me.  Well, you're going to get the answer right now.  I have discovered that until General Mills restores the oat-based formula to the monster  cereals' recipes, there are two somewhat plausible workarounds.  One for Count Chocula and one for Frankenberry. 
[01:30:30]  Is this guy serious?  Yeah.  A workaround.  Another cereal company, Malt O'Neal, makes a competing product to Lucky Charms called  Marshmallow Métis.  Oh, that's the...  That's the poor kids.  I'm Métis.  Let me look at Marshmallow Métis.  Looks like cat food.  It looks horrendous.  Yeah, it comes in a big...  Who the fuck would buy that?  Poor kids.  This guy.  Yeah, that's ghetto food right there.  That's what the poor, underprivileged children have to eat. 
[01:31:00]  They have EBT cards?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you buy with them.  They have a chocolate version that, while partially corn-based, also contains enough  oat flour to answer, though not completely resolve the texture issue.  This is as close to the flavor and texture of the original Count Chocula as one can presently  get.  Maybe it tastes better when you put water on it, because that's how they eat it in the  ghetto, too.  They eat that cereal with water.  Milk goes bad.  Poor bastards.  That's literally a poor bastard.  I guess I lived in the ghetto, then.  Yeah?  Did you do water? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, when you ran out of milk.  I remember mommy coming home with whole milk, motherfuckers.  Or there was just enough milk to get a little, like, moisture in your bowl, and then you  have to fucking add the water, so you can eat it properly.  Dampen it up a little bit.  An approximation of Frankenberry can be achieved by replacing the milk in a bowl of Lucky Charms  with a bottle of strawberry Nesquik, which I'm sure the interns can procure for  you.  Now he's bossing around the interns.  Page three?  Ugh.  Page three is not as long as the other two. 
[01:32:00]  Thank God.  Holy shit.  If you really want to simulate Count Chocula and Frankenberry, you can take these alternatives  one step further by swapping out the marshmallows in the chocolate marshmallow meaties and Lucky  Charms with their monster-shaped counterparts from boxes of Count Chocula and Frankenberry.  This guy's a fucking psychopath.  Or better yet, have the interns do it for you.  I do believe he's a serial killer. 
[01:32:30]  Like that one, Obster.  Like it.  Good one.  Good one.  That's what I want.  He writes like one.  I want the fucking interns picking things out of the cereal and mixing it up so I could  then eat it.  I am beyond.  Maybe Jackie and Sydney, but yes.  I am beyond disappointed in General Mills for their short-sightedness here.  My three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Quinn, who incidentally, Ope, was born the same  week as your son.  Oh, boy.  Loves Halloween and asks me to buy the Halloween cereal when we go shopping and dejectedly wants 
[01:33:00]  to know why I won't.  The kid won't know.  Buy the fucking cereal for the kid.  It's delicious.  Don't take your dumb fucking hang-up psychopath OCD and put it on your kid.  Do you think cereal tasted better in the 70s?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  You pour out this stupid cereal to your kid, they're going to love it.  He's going to explain.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Why are you jumping ahead?  He's going to explain why he refuses to buy the cereals for his kid.  I can't, in good conscience, allow my child to think that this is what a quality cereal 
[01:33:30]  should taste like.  Holy fuck.  Because never having experienced it in the 70s or 80s, she has nothing to compare it  to.  That's true.  But can he do the same experiments that he wants us to do?  I guess, but who has that kind of time?  So not only can I not enjoy the monster cereals, I can't share the fun with my kid either.  Wow.  Yes, you can.  I'd sue.  My goal is simple.  Here's the summary, people.  My goal is simple.  To motivate General Mills to eliminate the corn from the monster cereals and restore them 
[01:34:00]  to their former oat-based delicious glory.  Yeah.  I'd love to know what you guys think.  I'd be happy to call into the show.  Or perhaps schedule permitting even stop by the studio to discuss this.  Are you shitting me, dude?  He wants to explain this live on the air.  All the best.  Keith.  A.K.A.  Serial guy.  Jimmy's Apple consultant.  Oh, wow.  All right, this guy's a psycho. 
[01:34:30]  I killed a box of Count Charkula like a week ago.  It was delicious.  It was fine, wasn't it?  It was awesome.  Well, my kid the other day, and people thought I set it up for a good photo op, the fucking  assholes on Twitter, poured out my latest box of Lucky Charms.  Oh, man.  It wasn't set up.  See?  Cunts.  And let me tell you.  So can I take the box of Lucky Charms?  Maybe.  Thank you.  Maybe a kid didn't like the Lucky Charms because they fucking...  Weren't oat-based or corn-based or what?  Thank you. 
[01:35:00]  Oh!  Wow.  Jesus, Sam.  Yeah, this arm on me.  What?  This arm on me.  I can't control it sometimes.  Yeah, you got quite an arm.  So now what?  Serial throwing arm.  Now what?  Now what?  I'm going to take a dump.  Eric.  Eric, do you know anything about this serial controversy?  Who gives a shit?  That could be...  And that's coming from me.  That could be the best way to wrap that whole thing up.  Who gives a shit?  Ah, a little cereal bowling.  Those two cereals they brought back suck anyway. 
[01:35:30]  They're terrible.  That's why they discontinued them in the 70s.  People stopped buying them.  Blueberry isn't even any good.  What happened to Corey Feldman?  Oh, boy.  Why don't you bring it up?  What?  Why would you bring that up?  I see his book there.  It's going to be on the after show, right?  I don't know for sure because...  What happened to Corey Feldman?  Well, he was scheduled to do a morning show.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And then this morning, about 90 minutes before he was scheduled to come in...  Right.  ...the host decided to cancel out.  That's a dick move.  Why would they do that?  I know.  Well, because instead... 
[01:36:00]  That's horrible.  Instead of talking to Corey Feldman...  Right.  ...they wanted to use that time on the show...  Right.  ...to read serial letters.  ...to read a letter about cereal.  A three-page letter.  Exactly.  ...about oat-based and corn-based.  Yes.  Yes.  And to wonder why...  I've got to hit the can.  ...fruit-fruit...  I really don't.  It's not what it used to be.  I really don't.  My stomach's gurgling.  I think it was the fact that I drank vitamin water and then a V8.  Sure.  That doesn't mix well.  I think it's break time anyway. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Try some chocolate marshmallow mateys.  I'm going to try to sop it up with some mateys.  What do you mean they're going for a Lucky Charms thing if they've got chocolate in there?  I know.  It's not.  That's Cocoa Pebbles and Lucky Charms mixed together.  All right.  Go ahead.  You can't do that.  I got this, I think.  All right.  I got this for a little bit.  You fucking tag team.  I love it.  I got this.  Open that up, at least.  The marshmallow mateys.  The marshmallow...  Yeah, this is just getting poor kids filled up with sugar.  Let me see that.  Lucky Charms isn't even that good.  Lucky Charms is delicious. 
[01:37:00]  Lucky Charms should just be marshmallows and take the rest of that shit out of it.  No, man.  That's a good combination.  Just make kids diabetic.  Yeah.  And it's a good combination, the two.  Although my kid already figured it out and he just eats the marshmallows.  He does?  Yeah.  He's not stupid.  Look at...  His father might be stupid, but my kid's not stupid.  Let me see that.  There we go.  Let me see the marshmallow mateys.  I want to try them.  That's a big bag of marshmallow mateys.  All right.  It's super-sized.  What?  It's super-sized.  What do you mean?  That's the size of the bag.  Super-sized bag. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, really?  Oh.  Oh!  It's all over the floor.  That's unfortunate.  And now Roland's stepping on a fruit fruit.  He's picking the bag back up.  No!  Oh!  We have to get a visual element.  He just threw it all over Roland. 
[01:38:00]  He just threw the open bag of chocolate marshmallow mateys on Roland.  Roland is not happy.  Roland's got dust on him.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, Ro-Ro.  Wait, Ro-Ro.  Oh, he's...  Wait, Ro.  He's not happy, but he...  No, I can't though, because it's going to get all over.  Oh, Ro-Ro.  You can do it.  Serial fight.  Serial fight.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Mars.  Mars, I don't know what happened.  Will that be a problem with the equipment?  Yeah.  I don't want to throw it.  I don't know what happened.  We're good?  Yeah.  No, he wants to throw it over there. 
[01:38:30]  Not the east door.  What are you?  What are you, a pussy?  What are you, a pussy?  Well, yes.  What are you, a pussy?  Dude, he just...  A huge vagina, because I don't want to pay.  What are you, a pussy?  He just threw a bag of cereal all over you.  Are you a pussy?  Yes.  Hey.  You're going to just take that shit?  Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro.  Do it for Corey.  You got cereal dust all over your shirt.  Or this is HR, abuse of a Mexican.  What are you, a pussy?  Come on.  I have a huge vagina.  Come on.  I'm throwing it.  I'm ruining the equipment.  Come on.  I'm filming you now being a pussy. 
[01:39:00]  And then I get sent down with management and I go, oh.  So if he comes to you on the bridge...  No.  Do it.  Do it.  Roland.  Do it.  Do it.  I'm filming you being a pussy.  Roland, don't be a pussy.  I'm filming you being a pussy.  What pussy?  He just threw a super-sized bag...  Yeah.  ...of poor kid cereal at you.  That's right.  You're going to let me get away with that shit?  You're going to let me get away with everything.  So, yeah.  You're the boss.  You're the host.  That's the privilege of getting away with everything.  Come on, man.  I'm calling you out. 
[01:39:30]  He's canceling your guest's day of.  I did.  I canceled Corey Feldman.  Oh, my God.  Last minute.  That's different from last month?  How?  Come on, people.  Come on.  Are you going to be a pussy or what?  Don't puss out, dude.  This is your shot.  No.  I strike back later.  No, you won't.  Nope.  This is your chance.  This is it.  This is your chance.  No, because they got ruined the equipment and the Mars will go, oh, cereal dust is the reason  why it's not working.  Dude, he's on here calling you a pussy and saying throw the cereal at him.  That's right.  No court in the world. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  Would find you guilty of damaging that equipment.  Come on, let's do this.  Except for the one down the hall.  I don't think so.  Come on, let's do this.  Come on, let's do this.  Give me another box of cereal.  Throw it at an arc so it misses the board.  Oh, boy.  What do you want?  Fruit Brute.  That was Opie.  Fruit Brute is in the hands of Opie.  This is Fruit Brute.  That's Fruit Brute.  Here, can you take this for a second?  Yeah, sure.  It's not recording right now.  Ew.  You might want to get a long shot. 
[01:40:30]  Uh-oh.  Roland.  Maybe I guess pinch a little like some cereal.  Roland.  Good luck, Roland.  Come on!  Let's do this!  Let's do this!  Let's do this right now!  No.  Give me the other box. 
[01:41:00]  There you go.  Come on, Roland.  Stop being a pussy.  I'm not doing it.  No!  Stop being a pussy.  No!  Come on.  I'm in trouble.  You know you want to.  Oh, God, I do.  Oh!  Oh!  Come on!  Let's do this!  He just threw three boxes of cereal at you, Roland.  Very hard, too.  Look at you!  Come on, let's do this!  You're covered in dust and marshmallows. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, but it hurts.  Your last chance.  Let's go.  Pick your favorite flavor.  Let's do this.  No.  It's Halloween, Roland.  It's Halloween.  I know it's Halloween.  All right.  I can't do it.  Oh, no.  I'm sure.  Hubbell berry.  I'll be careful.  Eric likes that one.  Huh?  I'll go for you, Eric.  Ah, it's gonna hurt.  It's like rocks.  What the fuck?  Ah!  Ah!  Oh.  That's a bag.  Ah! 
[01:42:00]  Ah!  Ow!  Roland, he's treating you like a piece of shit.  I don't think he has a ball to finish the three boxes.  The balls is rolling.  You see how much cereal's in this place?  It's really bad.  Boys, it smells good in here, though.  Someone get me some milk.  I think Roland needs some milk with his cereal.  Oh, no.  Does anyone have any milk?  I'm actually intolerant. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, Roland.  If I throw it, it's gonna fuck up the console.  You know how much I love Lucky Charms.  You are sacrificing your children's Lucky Charms.  You know how much I love Lucky Charms.  And look, Roland is now cleaning up the console.  That's humiliating.  That's gonna be a fist right through there.  Because you're not my boss.  You're a chick.  Can you put the book down for a second?  No.  Uh-oh.  Ah! 
[01:43:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, there's cereal everywhere.  There's a Star Wars proof.  I told Ann I got this.  I told him I had this.  Ann is shitting and he's gonna come back.  And there's half a dozen boxes of cereal  spread all over the studio.  All right, we'll take a break.  Pendulet's next.  Let's see.  This is the OPN Anthony Show. 
[01:43:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.  What's up, man?  Smells delicious in here, but...  It does smell very nice.  Wowie, kazowie.  There is cereal everywhere.  It's everywhere.  How many boxes, Sam?  Five?  It was five boxes and then also the super-sized bag of Marshmallow Mades. 
[01:44:00]  Six boxes?  The ghetto bag.  I got like three or four on film.  I dared fucking roll in a fight pack.  You wouldn't fight back.  Why wouldn't I?  I don't know.  I don't understand that.  Wow.  There is so much cereal everywhere.  It's ridiculous.  It's tracking out into the hall.  No, don't track it into the hall.  That's when I'm going to get in fucking trouble for this nonsense.  Like, it's stuck to my...  I got clumps of grain and marshmallows on the bottom of my shoe. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now the interns are in here having to clean up cereal.  Oh, there it is.  It goes to the vacuum.  Oh, she's having a little trouble working that vacuum.  Step on that little pedal thing to the left.  Doesn't it have a hose thing where you just fucking use the hose?  Nah, you got to do that first.  Is it coming up at all?  Kind of, but it's also flinging everywhere.  Okay, no, it's working.  It's working pretty good?  Yeah, it actually is. 
[01:45:00]  Amazing vacuum right there.  It's a very cheap way to promote my Twitter, but...  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think five boxes of cereal is going to fit in that canister.  It's already filling up so quickly.  Look at how full the canister is getting.  All right, well...  It's almost up to the HEPA filter.  All right, you got to empty the vacuum.  You're going to have to empty it every 30 seconds.  Every 30 seconds or so.  Yeah, pretty much.  It can't go up to the filter, really.  But vacuum your ass off before, you know, the people upstairs get word of this, come down, 
[01:45:30]  and then cause a fucking issue.  Yeah, this was too much fun.  Somebody's going to have an issue with it.  Well, it's usually the too much fun that always ends up being an issue.  There you go.  Now dump that fucker in the garbage here, and we'll be okay, I think.  The guy who's screening calls outside the studio for whatever show thought it was hilarious.  Hilarious!  He's enjoying that now the whole area smells like fruity, delicious, sugary cereals.  It is delicious.  Well, Ant went and took a dump, in case you're tuning in.  Oh.  And we just did a, we just read a really boring three-page letter about cereal, and I just 
[01:46:00]  felt like we had to do something.  I felt like we had to do something, so I started a nonsense cereal fight with Roland.  The poor intern's having a little trouble with the, um, canister.  The vacuum?  He doesn't know how to empty it.  Yeah.  I saw this on Animal Planet once.  It was kind of fun to watch.  They're calling Roland a punk for not fighting back, Sam.  Oh, damn.  Well.  A punk.  I would have fought back. 
[01:46:30]  You would have fought back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would have thrown a box of cereal at you.  It smells like Halloween in here now.  It smells very, uh, fruity and sweet.  It smells very delicious.  Andy-like.  Delicious.  All these marshmallows are stuck to the bottom of my shoes.  Like gum.  He's got it.  Look.  I think he got it.  Now, in another 30 seconds, you'll have to fucking empty it again.  Yeah, yeah, marshmallows are sticking to the bottom of everybody's, oh, yeah.  All over your sneakers.  Oh, yeah.  All fully.  That's right. 
[01:47:00]  And the waffling.  We had to pump up the cereal bit.  Oh.  I had to pump it up a little bit for the people out there.  I just liked the letter reading was good.  I thought we were going to stick with the guy's idea of testing the different cereals  and choosing corn or oats.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  That was brilliant.  Which was more aerodynamic, Opie?  Corn or oats?  Oh, that's true.  I think corn flies a little better than the oats.  Okay.  I conducted my experiments just like that guy asked us to.  Synthetic.  So, cheap plug, I know, but Opie Radio for a few of the pictures from the cereal fight. 
[01:47:30]  What time is Penn coming in?  He's supposed to be here now.  Oh, boy.  What?  He can appreciate this.  Can he?  Dude, our logo looks...  What'd you say?  Our logo looks really cool covered in cereal.  Maybe we should leave it.  Yeah.  That is filling up so fast. 
[01:48:00]  It's five boxes of cereal.  You know, you need a shop vac.  Yeah.  One of those big barrel-like shop vacs.  That'll get it.  But the more equipment you get, the more questions start getting asked.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  Yeah, that's full again.  Huh?  That's it.  It's full again.  What do you mean it's full again?  The vacuum.  Yeah, the vacuum's all full again.  Well, do something about it. 
[01:48:30]  Holy shit.  You know what's good about this, though?  What?  Every room that that vacuum's used in, again, for the rest of its life, it's gonna smell great.  It's gonna smell delicious.  It's just gonna...  You know, you ever notice somebody that has a dog and their vacuum just smells like dogs?  They fucking turn on the vacuum and start vacuuming, and the air that comes out, it's like,  Oh, it smells like wet old dog.  Well, now this is gonna smell like fucking nice cereal.  What is that?  It's under the couch?  Holy God.  Yeah.  We have to remove all the furniture out of the studio, because there's probably a full 
[01:49:00]  box worth of cereal under all the couches here.  I think you should have gotten the Dyson ball.  Dyson vacuums.  Look at how it sucks it up with its cyclonic action.  That guy don't sound like a fruit.  My work is done here today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And ain't gonna get better for you than this?  Yeah, yeah.  Why even try?  Dyson! 
[01:49:30]  I need a Dyson vacuum!  Oh!  Oh, man.  They're pulling fucking furniture out of the studio.  This is bad.  This is bad.  Why is it bad?  Oh, it is tracking out.  Let's start having fun again.  All right?  When?  Let's start having fun!  You missed it.  Oh, boy.  It wasn't even like he was throwing some cereal out of five boxes.  I was picking up boxes to see if I could get a handful or something out of them.  Empty boxes.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, in one fell swoop, the entire box of cereal was thrown at roll. 
[01:50:00]  Look at how cool our logo looks covered in cereal, though.  It does look cool.  That looks all right, right?  It looks like a Banksy in here.  Yeah!  It's crazy.  Anyone could do the Banksy thing.  Yeah, you just throw cereal all over the floor.  I missed this, but why is that guy in blackface?  Huh?  What the fuck is going on?  On the bottom TV.  For the last two years, there's a guy out of Ohio.  Sends me $15 a month for a haircut.  I've never cashed your checks.  Every month, I get $15.  I'm going to put it in my trust account eventually. 
[01:50:30]  Well, look.  It looks good.  You're a good-looking bald man.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know about that, buddy.  It looks pretty nasty.  It looks like some guy's on a strip in Vegas right now, actually.  Is he in blackface?  Yeah, what are you, Bobby?  I don't think so.  Or is he just tan?  I think he's just a tan guy.  He sure looks like he's in blackface.  Let's accuse him of it.  Well, I'm just going to accuse him of it anyway.  Much like we did Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  We accused him of being a gay man.  How are we doing over there?  Bad.  What do you mean bad?  I mean, there is a...  We can't be bad.  There's a huge amount of cereal that was thrown all over the studio. 
[01:51:00]  Well, Roland did some kind of Mexican fucking hat dance all over the cereal.  With him, it's just called a hat dance.  He crushed it into the carpet.  Right.  It was laying all nice.  And then he decided to do some weird Mexican dance.  This is like a fucking vacuum commercial.  Huh?  Because, you know, this is probably the toughest assignment you're going to get for a vacuum.  Crunched and crushed in cereal into a carpet.  It's got sugar in it, so it's kind of sticky. 
[01:51:30]  It's marshmallows.  On the fibers, marshmallows.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Happy Halloween, huh?  Well, you know.  I guess I forgot.  This was our big Halloween bit.  This is our Halloween party.  Yeah, yeah.  Why didn't Roland fight back?  He was afraid of...  I gave him every opportunity.  Well, you know, the thing is, Roland realized that when you throw cereal in a studio full of  equipment, some of the equipment can be damaged.  We're still broadcasting, aren't we?  Yeah.  Somehow we are.  It's not wet.  I mean, we have to broadcast over the sounds of a vacuum cleaner. 
[01:52:00]  Well, and I did ask for milk.  Oh, you did?  That would have been...  They did not give me milk.  That would have been tragic.  Oh, it's coming up.  All right.  Yeah, but you can vacuum.  I got a good view of this now.  You can only vacuum for 30 seconds.  Oh, there you go.  Would you have thrown the milk?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, no problem.  That would have been bad.  It's time to fucking start having fun again.  You're right.  All right.  Let's see what this fucking radio show could do.  Right?  Well, so far, we can pour five boxes of cereal all over the floor. 
[01:52:30]  Pour?  That wasn't pouring.  Throw.  Oh, my God.  It's coming up good, Ann.  We're good.  Yeah, but look, he's done already again.  I know.  I know.  That vacuum sounds full, doesn't it?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, get a fucking shop vac, jerky.  I think I've got to pay the interns today.  Oh, man.  Didn't sign up for this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  This is like, this will help you in your search for broadcasting jobs.  Right.  Well, you can also tell that, like, the amount of housework and stuff that gets done, because  this kid's never used a vacuum cleaner before in his life. 
[01:53:00]  He looked at it like it was a fucking strange device.  I think he thought it was something you smoke the pot out of.  That's right.  Well, how about we do this?  Huh?  What?  We're going to take another break, get some live reads done, and hopefully Penn Jillette will  be here next.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, we need...  Where's Penn?  He's coming.  Right now?  What do you mean?  That's vague.  Why are you being so vague, Roland?  Oh, my God.  Roll it.  Roland kicked over the pile.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Where is he?  He's got a few blocks away. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, okay.  So we'll break right now.  When we get back, Penn Jillette, stay there.  All right.  This is the OP and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  It's the OP and Anthony Show.  We've got Penn Jillette outside the studio. 
[01:54:00]  Mr. Jillette, come on in.  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da.  Ah, there he is.  The gesture.  Ah, that's a gesture.  Give me that gesture.  That's a good gesture, right?  Come on in.  A very good gesture.  All right.  How are you doing?  Come on in.  I figure we're friends now where you can just do that gesture thing.  We can certainly do that.  There was a little accident with some cereal, but it smells nice in here. 
[01:54:30]  It smells very nice.  Give a nice pleasant funk.  We went old school, did a little shock jockery for everybody.  Oh, that's good for you.  Old school.  That's good for you.  Penn, we've got to start with the Celebrity Apprentice.  We haven't talked to you since.  I know.  And what I heard...  How the fuck do you lose to that guy?  First of all, I tell you, have Trace on.  He's a good guy.  You'll have a good time.  Didn't I tell you that?  Yes, you did.  We ended up really liking him.  Right, but totally liking him to the point...  We pull you off. 
[01:55:00]  I go to that show, my show that night, and they go, I thought O&A liked you.  And I go, yeah, we get along great.  What was it?  They go, well, they're telling Trace he's going to win and fuck you.  And they're...  I go, what?  And I said, they didn't say his ice cream was better.  No.  Well, no.  They said, well, he didn't say it was worse.  I said, what's wrong with those fuckers?  How long have I been your friend?  How many times have I tickled your ball sack with my tongue?  Oh, Penn.  Can I break this down for you?  Okay, break it down.  Your ice cream was way the fuck better. 
[01:55:30]  Way the fuck better.  To the point I continued buying even...  Fuck yeah, we know that.  We didn't even have to buy it anymore.  I was still buying it.  No one has to discuss that.  No one thinks.  No one in the world thinks it's better.  But quite honestly, your personal story wasn't as impressive as his.  What's his personal story?  He got shot in the heart and lived.  We weren't competing on being in the wrong place when a bullet's being fired.  Are you telling me it's the smarter person?  That is shot through the fucking heart?  He actually has real bullets shot at him.  Fuck yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, man.  No, see, the goal in life is the one who gets hurt the less wins.  That's true.  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  And then...  And he was funnier than me, I suppose, on the fucking show.  No.  No, no, no.  Okay.  But he had better stories.  He's been shot at many times.  That's true.  No, a fake shot.  No, but I have also been really shot at.  I've really had a gun pulled on me twice.  Oh, man.  And it was not fired.  And I consider that to be, because I handled the situation, better.  Better than Trace did.  Better.  I'll just give you a little piece of advice. 
[01:56:30]  Uh-huh.  Getting shot worse than not getting shot.  I gotta agree with that.  So, let's see, Trace is a better talker than me?  Yeah.  Smarter than me?  Oh, no.  Better ice cream than...  You wouldn't believe it wasn't me, right?  And I got really...  Let me tell you this.  In the celebrity apprentice world, you get sucked into that Scrooge McDuck fucking wacko shit.  You get sucked into it and you believe it, right?  So, the final thing is coming down.  I come on, do my buddies.  They're really supportive.  I'm feeling great, right?  It's great. 
[01:57:00]  I go to do a show in wherever the fuck it was, New Jersey, right?  And I'm feeling pretty good about myself.  And I'm out signing autographs after the show.  Like a thousand people want to sign my autograph.  And guy number five goes, man, ONA sold you out.  And I go, what do you mean?  They go, oh, they were saying that Trace should win.  Trace was the winner.  Oh, my God.  He's never even been on the show before.  And they go, oh, they love him.  They just sold you right there. 
[01:57:30]  We're easy.  We're easy.  I go, okay, well, this guy's a nut, right?  Because you get nuts, right?  Yes, yes, sure.  Of course.  You get nuts.  So, sign another 10, 15 autographs.  Uh-huh.  Whoa, did you hear ONA?  Oh, no.  What do you mean I hear ONA?  Oh, they sure love Trace, man.  They were sucking his dick.  Okay.  You bunch of fucking rats out there is what you are.  Okay, let me just bring the whole thing, the whole thing to an end.  Just to misunderstand.  Yeah, yeah.  Take all the jokes out and everything.  Okay.  We finished signing about 1,000 people.  Yeah.  I'm standing there.  We sign outside. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  1,000 people have left.  I'm standing there picking up my markers, picking up my water.  Glenn comes over.  Glenn goes, you okay?  And I go, I'm a little bummed.  It's stupid, but I'm a little bummed.  Oh, no.  He says, what?  What?  Why?  Why?  And I go, I heard that like ONA were saying that Trace should win.  And he says, you know that this game doesn't mean anything to you.  You don't give a fuck.  I said, I don't give a fuck, but it just feels, I feel like I've just gone through some 
[01:58:30]  sort of weird breakup.  I'm really bummed.  And he says to me, well, you know, it's all the pressure of the show.  You've been working hard.  You haven't been sleeping.  And I said, it was like five people.  He said, I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.  I'm going to call tomorrow.  And the next day, he says to me, yeah, I guess they do.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  I do have two other points here.  First of all, with the Trace Atkins, what impressed us, he gets shot in the heart by  his wife or girlfriend at the time, and he doesn't scream. 
[01:59:00]  And he's just relaxed and goes, all right, call 911.  No, but that's in the story.  What?  It was impressive.  But that's in the story.  It's impressive.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean it happened that way.  Well, we're gullible.  We believe half your tricks.  They're not tricks.  Sorry, sorry.  And here's the other thing about...  They're swindles.  Here's the other thing about Celebrity Apprentice that blew me away for real.  I saw the finale, because I was rooting for you in the end.  You know that.  Oh, I don't know that.  Say that again. 
[01:59:30]  We are rooting for you.  Okay, well, do you mean it?  I was hoping you won, but his goddamn story was like, oh, God.  It's like he made it up to win.  Yes.  That's precisely my point.  He had to make up for the fact that his ice cream was horrendous.  Horrendous.  It was horrible.  It was terrible.  But then this is what I learned by watching the finale, because you're on it.  That's the only reason I watched.  Thank you.  And your new boyfriend, Trace, was also on it.  He is dreamy.  He is dreamy.  He's better looking than me. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, he's got that voice.  And I would think that if any two guys would not go for better looking, it would be you  too.  There you go.  But here's my point.  The whole season was a ruse.  Yes.  Because Donald Trump hated you from day one, because of what you wrote in your book about  him.  Oh, that's right.  He called you out.  He was never going to let you in anyway.  Do people know this?  He said it on the air?  He said it on the air.  Well, so I'm telling the people that maybe didn't watch the finale.  He basically said that he doesn't like you because of what you wrote about him in your 
[02:00:30]  book.  That's what he said.  And then he said, do you want to apologize?  And I said, no.  Thank you.  And thank you for saying no.  When someone says to you, do you want to apologize?  It's the moment of truth.  Right.  That's the crossroad.  And then I'm sitting there going, oh my, he had no intention of having you win ever.  No.  No.  There was no intention.  And there was actually fights with, um, with, uh, Walgreens and the producers who wanted  me to win.  Right.  Right.  And they were, they were much more pissed than I was. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, because they could have sold a lot more ice cream if you want.  Because in the end, it was a much better product.  And, uh, the other, the other thing that, uh, I can't, I can't tell you who, but people  involved in the, uh, production who were so embarrassed ended up giving me that amount  of money for the charity.  Wow, they did.  Yeah.  Well, good for you.  They just said, this was kind of bullshit.  Let's write you.  Well, that's good.  So Opportunity Village made a, uh, uh, a, uh, a metric shit ton of money.  What's weird about Donald Trump, he, he, he dishes out a lot of abuse, but then you give  him a little shot and he can't take it. 
[02:01:30]  Well, when the shot is as perfect as my shot.  It was a good shot.  That his hair looks like cotton candy made of piss.  Dead on.  Why is he, why is he surprised at that?  For, for some reason he's decided to have horrible hair even though he's a billionaire.  I've seen better, I've seen better hair systems than that.  Yeah.  Way better.  Well, they have.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, well, I hope we, we, we straighten this all out, Pat.  And you came out to Vegas.  I came out to Vegas.  And you didn't wear your baseball hat.  No.  And you're absolutely unrecognizable. 
[02:02:00]  He did not even recognize me.  And I knew he was there.  That's our biggest fear though.  When you guys finally give us an invite, we show up and like, oh, oh, he doesn't even  know.  No, no.  Once, once I knew you, I treated, I treated you with a great deal of joy.  You came back with great stories, how you treated him.  It was fantastic.  And, and the show itself is just amazing.  I loved it.  I can't believe that your baseball hat is what I recognize.  I know.  I, I, I didn't have the hat on, uh, cause you know, it's a classy jerk.  I don't want to be in a classy jerk with a hat on, but, uh, what a great time. 
[02:02:30]  And the show was so much fun to watch, man.  I got to see it.  Just a blast.  And now you guys, although I imagine there's someone else who's better looking with a better  voice who can seduce you.  I am now doing a fund anything.  I'm doing a crowdfunding campaign.  Yes, yes, yes.  I saw this.  And you watching the other, did you see the Jim Norton or anything?  Uh, no, I didn't see that.  Okay.  Cause we went, you know, the idea, I want to make this movie called, uh, Director's Cut.  I made The Aristocrats, which did very well.  Sure.  I made it with my own money.  I made, uh, uh, this thing called Tim's Vermeer, which is a smart artsy movie that's doing fabulous 
[02:03:00]  on the circuit that we made with our own money.  And then I wanted to make one movie that was like a horror movie, thriller movie, down and  dirty.  And the idea I had was to do a movie that had a director's commentary over it.  But you realize that the director's commentary is not by the real director, but rather by a  psycho.  And he's gotten, he's gotten onto the director.  He's set and stolen all the outtakes from an FTP site and he's kidnapped the lead actress 
[02:03:30]  and he has her tied up and is making her do scenes that cut in with the movie while  he's doing the director's commentary.  And I wanted to be the bad guy.  You know, after two years of going on Celebrity Apprentice and sucking corporate dick, I wanted  to be a bad motherfucker.  And you know, I'm right on the edge of bad motherfucker.  Yes, you are.  You are.  So I decided to crowdfund, make Penn a bad guy. 
[02:04:00]  And I got all my friends.  Let me just tell you this test here.  The idea is it's fundanything.com.  You just go right there.  There's a page.  Click right to Penn.  Or you can go to fundanything.com slash Penn.  P-E-N-N.  Take you right there.  And I asked 50 friends, including Jim, to make me a video to help me sell this movie.  I need a million bucks to make the movie.  So help people give money.  Now, if you ask your friends to do that, some of them will, some of them won't. 
[02:04:30]  If you ask your friends to give money, none of them will.  But let me run this test.  If you ask your friends to do a video calling you an asshole, saying Penn's become a real  dick, I hate this fucker, everybody comes through.  100%.  I mean, David Copperfield, if nothing else, you've got to watch the David Copperfield one.  He did it from his island.  Of course, yes.  All he is is explaining what an asshole I am and how I've been an asshole forever.  And it's really funny.  Matt and Trey did it.  Neil Patrick Harris did it. 
[02:05:00]  Joan Rivers, I saw.  Yeah, Joan Rivers.  But the best one, and with all due respect to Jim Norton, the best one is that Lawrence O'Donnell  and Glenn Beck did one together.  Together.  How did that come about?  They're both friends of mine.  And they did a script that were together, cut together.  And they have agreed to, for the first time they'll ever meet, they will act in my movie.  Wow.  So there's only like two days. 
[02:05:30]  And we have amazing rewards.  I mean, you give like a few hundred dollars, you get a suite at the Rio, tickets to our  show, hang out afterwards, magic lesson, juggling lesson, come over to my house.  That's pretty good.  Everybody's saying, you know, other people's rewards are like, you get a t-shirt, fuck you.  Right, right, right.  But these rewards are insane.  There's two days, three days left.  And you just go to fundanything.com.  And at least check out the videos.  It's like, not all of them are up yet, but Glenn and Lawrence O'Donnell.  And it will really kill you.  The two of them working together. 
[02:06:00]  I kind of watched that immediately.  Yeah, it's pretty.  They don't like each other.  Oh, they really don't.  No, no.  And you know, I got them to, you know, both blurb my book, which they were kind of against.  And then I kind of, I'm sucking them into my cab.  And I just want to, and I'm not also, this is something very important.  In this movie within a movie, I am not having Lawrence O'Donnell play Lawrence O'Donnell.  He is not playing generic TV guy.  Glenn Beck is not playing TV pundit.  They are playing two police officers who are partners and who hate each other. 
[02:06:30]  Fucking great.  That's perfect.  Wow, that's great.  That's the movie director's cut.  And it's being crowdfunded.  And if you go to the site and crowdfund, you'll also notice that the bad guy who gets his access  to the movie to attack the female lead is already in the crowdfunding.  He's already helping.  He's already putting money in.  So the bad guy is already there.  Nice.  So we're monkeying with everything. 
[02:07:00]  This is kind of a reality goes over, a fantasy kind of, look at you.  Yeah, I'm excited.  What is it?  Is it real?  Is it for all my God?  Well, you know, I love that Blair Witch happened on the internet.  And I want this movie to happen in crowdfunding.  So when there's a crowdfunding party, the bad guy will be there.  Yeah.  The bad guy will be there.  And I think, did you watch the video of me with the woman tied up?  I did not.  You look very creepy.  I look pretty creepy.  You do, yeah.  And I just do that all myself. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there's no makeup or shit.  No prosthetics.  There's no hanging off flesh.  You let your hair down there.  I let my hair down, take my glasses off and scare the shit out of Anthony.  And you're mean.  Do you want us to call our pal Trace to see if he wants in on this?  Trace came through and did a video for him.  Did he really?  Yes, he did.  Oh, excuse me.  Trace is my pal.  Someone came back after the show and said...  He's our fake pal.  Well, that's what I like to hear.  We haven't seen him since.  I don't think we'll see him any time soon. 
[02:08:00]  Trace came back.  Someone came to the show and said, in Vegas, after the show, they said to me,  so you still hang out with Trace?  And I said, well, he's playing golf with my wife right now.  And he comes out and stays in the house and plays golf all the time and hangs out.  And then my family's going out to visit his family.  We get along great.  And we have no problems.  There's no problems between me and Trace, except you two.  Yes.  Why the fuck did ONA suck up?  I expected...  You know, I told you to put him on. 
[02:08:30]  I told you he'd be good.  And I expected you to be cordial, polite, very, very complimentary.  And then for one of you, I don't even care which fucking one.  You know, either the whop or the other one.  Either one of you.  Can't you either Opie?  You know, one of you would say, listen, man, you're really great.  But, you know, Penn's been on the show forever.  We got you to know that we're rooting for him.  His ice cream is a little better.  But listen, man, you are great.  You are fabulous. 
[02:09:00]  Was that said as ever said?  Yeah.  I mean, we did.  We did feel a little guilty.  No, it wasn't.  We felt a little guilty.  It wasn't said.  We felt a little guilty after the show.  I think we might have a clip.  Is it short, though?  I don't want to waste Penn's time with a long clip.  Yeah, it's short.  All right.  A short clip from that day.  Oh, no.  We hope you win Celebrity Apprentice.  I do, too.  You just told Penn that yesterday.  No, no.  I don't even know.  No, I said it after we looked at his backstory that we have to go with this guy.  I did say that.  I changed my opinion, even though he's a really good friend of ours. 
[02:09:30]  But how do you not root for a guy like this?  Penn's a really good friend of mine, too.  Yeah, but Penn has a sex dungeon.  That's all he's got going for him.  That's the Midwest.  Wow.  You know what the most important part of that whole clip was?  After Judas Iscariot over here kisses me on the fucking cheek,  he then, three sentences later, says he is a friend of ours.  And then this fuck beams in his chair and points to me like, 
[02:10:00]  see, after I said I wanted you to lose, I said you were my friend.  See, I'm an okay guy.  You know, if you'd have sat there with your head down in shame  like the fucking piece of shit you are, it would have been better.  But it's the point and the smile.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  That was really telling.  You didn't have to interpret that clip much to see what he meant by it,  which was, I hope, Tracy was like, see, we're okay.  I said we're a friend. 
[02:10:30]  He's a good friend of mine, too.  A good friend of mine.  A good friend of mine, too.  Okay, and since when does New York back Louisiana over Massachusetts?  Since when has that happened?  And any sort of jingoistic, tribalistic thing, you guys are on my side.  But I never said your ice cream, I stuck to the point that your ice cream was better.  Thank you.  So, although friendship doesn't matter to you, gluttony does. 
[02:11:00]  Penn, I don't want to throw Opie completely under the bus here, but I have to say something.  Did you hear me in the background?  Yes, I did.  I said, Opie, oh my God, you were saying that to Penn, you phony load of shit.  Yeah.  What?  He was there.  You sold me out.  I was backing Penn the whole time.  Yeah.  Let me practice this.  So, you know, I love you guys and Opie and Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I love one of them, man.  Oh, there you go.  And then you have plausible deniability as to which one.  One of them is great, man.  One of them is fucking great.  I swear I'm sweating. 
[02:11:30]  There's something a little real about this moment.  I'm sweating.  I have to tell you, and this is the really embarrassing part.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm telling you something that is humiliating, and you know that I often don't kid.  I just tell the truth when I tell it.  Yes.  I'm standing, you know, we're playing like wherever it was, New Brunswick, New Jersey, right?  Thousand people have gotten my autograph, but I have to like pick up my water bottle and  my stuff.  And I'm just standing like this.  And you're bummed.  And he's bummed out. 
[02:12:00]  After signing, you know, it's like, ah, I'm famous.  I'm successful.  I'm doing it.  But something's bothering me.  You'll leave here feeling a little better that I was only half the team.  Yeah, there you go.  That's pretty good.  Good cop, bad cop.  Yeah, you know.  Are you friends with Criss Angel?  Well, you know, I know him.  He's always been nice to me.  Mostly, no.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're going to get me to tell you to bring Criss Angel on.  No, no.  You're going to bring Criss Angel on.  Then you're going to sit there and say, oh, Mr. Magic Man, could you just pull down your 
[02:12:30]  pants so one of us can suck your cock, the other can tongue your asshole, then we can  finish up and say, and when you're in Vegas, there's only one magic show to see.  Is that what you're setting me up for?  No.  As funny as that is, we'll give you a taste of reality.  We haven't had him on since his trick went horribly wrong in front of us, and we kind  of felt kind of douchey, and we now don't have him on our show.  Yeah, that's wise.  And then Anthony brought to our attention his new show, and it's driving us nuts how his 
[02:13:00]  well, the tricks are okay.  His illusions.  Oh, it's his presentation.  Concentrate hard.  Huh?  Hard.  Concentrate hard.  Yeah.  Concentrate hard.  Concentrate hard.  His presentation is so uncomfortable to watch.  We all know these are illusions.  They're not illusions.  They're swindles done on TV.  Fair enough.  See, I was trying to be nice, but he walks across the pool in Vegas, and then he naturally 
[02:13:30]  has a woman swimming underneath him, like, posing.  I'm like, no, don't do that.  Yeah, the old plexiglass.  To basically say, see, look, quiet.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Quiet, Anthony.  Nobody knows.  I'm exposing this.  And then the...  Focus hard.  Focus hard.  Concentrate hard.  I love the idea.  Concentrate hard.  That's perfect.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  He did one where... 
[02:14:00]  Now, you've heard of this and seen, I'm sure.  He's a fire guy.  He pulls the person apart on the park bench.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like that.  And then the lower half...  A great little trick.  The lower half goes running away.  But that wouldn't happen.  And then the upper...  I mean, the upper half goes running away.  And, I mean, when it's on video like that, you could freeze frame, you could see it's a  little person or a person without legs or whatever the fuck it is.  No, it's someone that definitely is an amputee from the waist down.  And you can see their face is completely different than the face on the full-size person. 
[02:14:30]  It's like lazy or something.  Yes, yes, lazy.  And then the lady runs away with her hands like she knows how to do that because she's...  She was just pulled in half.  How would she know how to walk on her hands?  Right.  Because she's been doing it her whole life, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  But he doesn't think about these tiny little things that would help the swindle, you said?  Yeah.  The swindle a lot.  Well, let me talk about this.  Uh-huh.  A while ago, some people thought that the word trick was too short and that they wanted  to be pretentious. 
[02:15:00]  So they used the word illusion.  Illusion.  Now, illusion is not only a longer word that was very hard for Doug Heady to remember.  It not only has a full illusion.  Three syllables.  That's a good one.  But also, it's the wrong word because illusion means looks one way but really done another.  So it's for the mirror things.  It's for the stuff that's visual.  It's for the stuff that's less interesting magically.  And then all these people came up going, we don't do tricks. 
[02:15:30]  We do illusions.  And then people went, oh, okay.  I guess it's a longer word.  It must be more polite.  It's also wrong.  It's the wrong word.  We do tricks.  Chris Angel does tricks on TV, which means he's not in the category with David Copperfield.  He's in the category with Samantha Stevens on Bewitched.  Are you saying there's camera shenanigans going on? 
[02:16:00]  I'm just saying.  I can't.  I'm just saying.  No camera tricks.  Right.  Lots of editing tricks.  Lots of editing tricks.  No.  No, you know.  And a cast.  A cast of characters around him.  He does so well.  I don't understand.  People love that stuff.  Not so much these days.  Is there anyone you respect in your field?  Yes, everyone really.  I mean, David Copperfield does great tricks.  And he's been around for quite a while.  Been around forever.  And when you go to see his tricks, you don't know how they're done. 
[02:16:30]  And that seems like an important part of a magic show.  That is a very important part of a magic show, is not knowing and wondering and trying  to figure it out.  It's not everything.  Right.  But it should be the baseline.  It should be playing into it.  Yeah.  You want to be mystified.  Yeah, sure.  You know?  And David always does that.  David always delivers that.  You know, Lance Burton, who's now closed.  He's retired, but he used to do a great show.  How old is he that he's retired?  Younger than me.  He is, right?  Why did he retire?  54.  Is he all right?  Yeah.  He's fine.  He's had it?  I was short. 
[02:17:00]  He's had it.  He retired.  And I said to Lance, I said, you know, Lance, because this is what you say when you're  an old guy in show business.  Yeah, you think you want to get out of it now, Lance, but you're going to miss doing  the show every night.  You're going to miss the applause.  I'm telling you, you're going to be back within 18 months.  18 months.  I see Lance now, and he goes, he's great.  Yeah.  I get up at 6 in the morning.  I play pool.  I play with my dog.  Yeah.  That's what I do all day.  Really?  I just enjoy it.  I guess, yeah.  But why wouldn't you do, like, a shorter schedule or something? 
[02:17:30]  He doesn't want to ever walk on stage again.  He says to me, you know, Pat, when you're doing it, it seems like fun, but it's really  not.  Well, yeah, because, I mean, you make it fun for yourself, because you've got this over-the-top  personality.  I have a blast.  That's wonderful.  And I love it.  But these guys, like, a friend of ours did Broadway for a while.  He goes, I will never do another Broadway.  It's Stephen Lynch.  Yeah, yeah.  When he saw him backstage, he's like, I will never do this again.  I can't do the same exact thing.  And I go, what do you mean the same exact thing?  When you guys fell in the dumpster, you didn't improvise that? 
[02:18:00]  He goes, nope.  Every fucking night, we fall in the dumpster the exact same way.  And it got me to thinking, like, that's got to suck after a while.  Yeah, but it also has, it's a question of being a professional and being in the right  job.  Yeah.  What I love about it is, when you go out, like you guys are now, you have to think about  what you're going to say next, and you kind of get into this whole world of making sure  everything goes.  You guys are really, really good at doing a form, but not really good at the content, 
[02:18:30]  because you're not doing the same content every day.  So you don't know what's coming next, so you become people that learn form.  That's fine.  But the idea of learning content, the idea that I can go out and know what I'm going  to say, but be aware of every single person in the audience, exactly how I want to say  that sentence.  Doing a show over and over again is for someone that, like, sees Groundhog Day and thinks  that's a really good thing.  Right, right.  I'd love that.  I would love that, yeah.  I love, love, love going out and making the show on RCH Better every night. 
[02:19:00]  You explain that in your book perfectly.  I really enjoyed that part of your book.  You know, the fact...  Where you study the audiences, and you...  Sure.  And you pick up little things that they're...  And you really are so aware of them, and it's so terrific.  Yeah.  So I love it.  And Teller and I have the best of both worlds.  I mean, I get to do stuff like this, which is not scripted, and I love doing.  I get to do stuff in the show that's exactly scripted, and must be exactly scripted, where 
[02:19:30]  I cannot ad lib, or people could get hurt.  And then I do new stuff in the show all the time.  When you go to Vegas, everybody tells you.  You know, you get a show that's fairly successful, you go to Vegas, and it stays that way.  That's it.  You just go there until you die.  You play golf all day, you go in and do the show you know how to do.  Teller and I have never done that.  We've written five hours of material just in the past ten years in Vegas.  We've gotten like four brand new Broadway shows we wrote in Vegas. 
[02:20:00]  We put new stuff in.  And, you know, a lot of magicians will say, well, you can't trade out the stuff that's  gold.  That's gold.  And we go, but who says that you can only create 90 minutes of gold?  Right.  You know, we take out tricks that we fucking love.  We take out tricks that destroy the audience and that we love doing and we're not bored  with because there's something else that's a little harder to do and might blow their  minds a little more.  It'll be sloppy to begin with, but we hammock it. 
[02:20:30]  You know, we put it between a killer bit, killer bit after, put something in there.  See how it goes.  You saw Teapot.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty new when you saw that.  It was?  Yeah.  We've been working on that for two years.  But what happens with Teapot?  Christ.  We sing, I'm a little Teapot, short and stout.  Right.  Here's my handle.  Here's my spout.  But we act it out.  And I pick up Teller by one side and pour boiling water out of his hand.  And it's a great levitation.  It's just, and it's two minutes long with the show.  Took us two full years.  For two minutes. 
[02:21:00]  Two years.  Amazing.  Two years.  Do you finally have that aha moment in that two year period where you're like, okay, this  is how we're going to do it.  Yes.  And you're finally done.  No, no.  You're finally done.  Well, what happens in that two years where you're like, ah, just this angle's not right.  Well, everything has its different problems.  But what I wanted to do, you know, this is the thing that drives me crazy.  People who get into show business to get out of it.  You know, guys who are comics and then want to get a sitcom.  But you're a comic. 
[02:21:30]  That's what you do.  Or people that say, you know, I just want to make enough money doing this so that I can  kind of do less and retire.  And when I was 16 years old, living in Greenfield, Massachusetts, which is where I'll be tomorrow  night, my first time back in my hometown, doing a book reading.  You know, my book, Every Day is an Atheist's Holiday.  Say, how about them socks and you'll get a nice round of applause.  Just help me now.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Because we know you're not into sports.  No, I'm not.  Do you know the socks won last night, at least?  No, I didn't.  But thanks. 
[02:22:00]  It was a big thing, right?  The big game?  It was pretty big.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The World Series.  Oh, they won the World Series?  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  I know.  See, I know enough to know that's a big deal.  Oh, yeah.  Just say that.  They'll be like, yeah.  Wait, before you move on, though, one question in there.  That's why I went down that road.  How much ad-libbing per show?  Almost none.  Almost none.  Okay.  Once we get a bit tight, you know.  So when I was in Greenfield, 16 years old, never met anybody in show business, hoping  that I could do this.  If you told me you can have what to me in Greenfield would have been infinite amount of money, and 
[02:22:30]  a partner who is the best magic mind alive, you can write new stuff, and you'll have 2,000  people that'll come every night and see it.  That's heaven for me.  Right, right.  If you told me you're going to get to a certain place, you'll make a lot of money, and then  you'll just not think about the magic anymore, just go in every night and cash your check,  I would have gone, well, then I might as well work at the Sears.  Right.  You know, I mean, the money's different, but it's, so we, you know, we've been working 
[02:23:00]  on this bit, I'll tell you a stupid bit, I may have already mentioned this to you.  We got in our heads that, you know, Siegfried and Roy worked with big animals.  Yeah.  Now, we can't work with a tiger or an elephant, not just because we're cowards and scared,  but also because it's too dead on, it's not the right comedy for us.  So we got in our heads five years ago, we got to do something with a cow.  No, because a cow is bigger and heavier than a tiger, stupider, impossible to handle, and 
[02:23:30]  podunk.  So you make fun of the fact, you know, Penn and Teller vanish a cow, but it's going to  be an impossible fucking vanish.  Yeah.  So Teller and I five years ago start studying cows.  And, you know, big animal vanishes are really hard to do.  You have to use a box, and Penn and Teller don't push out boxes with glitter on them on stage,  so we can't do that.  Right, right.  But also, explaining the joke to them, hi, we're Penn and Teller, we got a cow, that  explains the joke.  So you can't do a tiger, because it's not a joke, and you can't do a cow, because it 
[02:24:00]  explains the joke.  Right.  Are you with me?  I'm right there.  So for comedy purposes, we can't do either.  It's going to be an amazing trick, but we can't get it comedically right.  So finally, we say, what if we dress up the cow as an elephant and call it the endangered  pygmy spotted elephant from the plains?  And then, because Siegfried and Roy have the magic garden of Siegfried and Roy, we'll have  Penn and Teller's magic pasture. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  And we're where the spotted pygmy elephants are.  So we get some, we go to cow experts, we find they love having a feed bag on.  They love having a bag full of food.  So do we all.  We like those fruit loops attached right there.  Oh, yeah.  And then we put a dryer hose on it.  The trunk?  Yeah.  Then we put big ears that flap, and then we put a little thing over it that says Elsie  the elephant. 
[02:25:00]  And you say Elsie the elephant, and a dryer hose, and you have a cow, you've got really,  really funny.  Then you've got to handle a cow, because handling a cow, cows are stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  You think moving Jim Norton around is hard.  Try a cow.  For the most part, they don't want to move anywhere.  They don't want to just lumber.  And they're heavier than you.  And the other thing that's embarrassing, and I'm only going to say this once, I don't  want to repeat it, cows are dangerous. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, I know, I know.  But you know, you're in close quarters with them.  Sure, sure.  They kick the shit out of you.  They have a sharp, very heavy kick.  Yeah, they do.  Very fast.  Really?  For four years, wham!  Yeah, for four years, we've been with cow traders.  And then we want to bring the audience up on stage, have them all touch it, say, is  that a real elephant?  Which is very funny.  Of course.  And they all say, yes, that's a real elephant.  Then, boom, boom, gone.  No trap door.  You can see under it, see above it, see around it. 
[02:26:00]  We want it to be the most amazing vanishing we've ever seen, and done stupid.  You know how we do that in our show.  You just saw the show.  That's the beauty of it.  I love it.  You do stuff that absolutely fries people, but then act like you're just doing dumb shit.  It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So the cow thing, we're now at, the budget is now $200,000.  Holy shit.  And it's now four years.  It's now a team of 15 people that are just the cow people.  We have a cow wrangler that's to bring them into the trailer, because the SPCA has to 
[02:26:30]  check everything.  Of course, make sure they're good every night.  And then, you know, the end of it is, I'll give away the punchline, because it makes me  laugh so much.  The end of it is, the curtain goes up for a moment.  And the audience can see under, so there's no trap door.  They can see over, they can see, they're all around.  Bring the thing up for a second, I say to tell her, you know, this audience is so good  tonight, tell her, I don't want to just vanish the elephant.  That's too easy.  I want to turn the elephant into a standard barnyard animal.  So the whole audience is disappointed. 
[02:27:00]  It's just a gag.  They pull down the sheet, and there's going to be the cow out of his elephant drag.  And we pull down the sheet, and it's a chicken.  Wow.  The chicken alone on stage, a live chicken.  The chicken replaces where the cow was.  Yeah, there's nothing there.  Somehow the cow vanishes.  Except the cow.  And I'll tell you, vanishing a cow is a...  We went through all the vanishing elephants people have done through the years, said, can't  do that, too obvious, nope, that won't work, nope, nope, nope.  And finally worked on stuff that we think is going to work.  Now, the whole thing...  Oh, so, all right. 
[02:27:30]  This is on the table still.  Four years.  I thought he gave up on this one.  No, no, no.  Oh, wow.  It's going to go in, I believe it'll go in probably February or March.  Now, that is really taking a chance as a magician, trickster, whatever you want to call it, because  I would assume...  Now, I know nothing about this gag, but I would assume at some point that cow has to move on  cue.  Call me silly.  Which right there is a problem.  Secondly is live animals tend to make noises if they're unhappy. 
[02:28:00]  And you don't want that ruining...  Well, we will be playing Born Free really loud during that.  Is that why you do that shit?  Of course that's why they do it.  Magicians don't like music.  If they had their way, they'd play white noise.  But you don't want a squeaky hinge giving over the day.  Born Free.  As free as the wind blows.  As free as the grass grows.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Oh, wow.  I'm a gullible fuck. 
[02:28:30]  If you've ever heard...  So that just covers up all the squeaks and the animal noises.  If you've ever heard the Siegfried and Roy show...  Yes.  Did you ever see Siegfried and Roy?  Never.  Just on TV, you know, like anyone else.  If you ever went to the Siegfried and Roy show live, which I went to, I loved it.  Went to the Siegfried and Roy show.  They played music at the volume of about Deep Purple 72.  Nice.  Right?  Highway star?  Come on.  Let's do this.  That music, that volume, what they were playing was da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:29:00]  But, you know, probably about 118 decibels.  Wow.  And if you went into rehearsals and they didn't put the CD on, the soundtrack of Siegfried  and Roy really sounded...  Fucking move it.  You know, I never thought of that aspect of it.  The sound of all those things, hinges, latches, clap...  So, we had to go forever saying, well, if we play Born Free, it's really, really funny. 
[02:29:30]  If we play it too loud, it's really, really funny.  And it covers up.  Because we can't go da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  We have to find the exact right song.  Right.  So, people go, isn't that great?  They're playing Born Free, too loud...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Four years, though.  Yeah, we've worked forever on this shit.  And it'll be...  I've been driving nuts to work on something for four years. 
[02:30:00]  It'll be a full five minutes.  Right.  Now, a gag like that.  And we're also selling...  I love this.  We're going to sell little wheels of Elsie Elephant Cheese.  Oh, that elephant cheese.  Of course.  It's wonderful.  The cow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting the labels put on...  Laugh and cow.  Yeah.  We're getting the little labels put on called Elsie Elephant Cheese.  Oh, man.  I wonder what a trick like that...  How much of that, when you first conceive of this gag and go, oh, this is what we want  to do, how much of it borrows techniques and stuff from other tricks that you do? 
[02:30:30]  And how many do you just need to 100% come up with brand new fucking way to do something?  This is it.  You know, Teller has used this analogy, and it's really right.  He said, magic is like if you were in music, and every time you wrote a song, you had to  build the instrument and learn to play it.  Okay, see?  That's...  I know exactly right.  That makes sense.  Right.  You can't just say, okay, now we're going to do this song.  We'll pick up the...  Because you know, what are we going to do?  Pick up the teapot and turn it into an elephant? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  No, you start from scratch.  It's one of the reasons that I enjoyed being on Celebrity Apprentice, because if you tell  me, you know, tomorrow, the three of us are going to go do something none of us know how  to do, you two might go, ugh.  And I go, okay, great.  Hey, that's kind of exciting.  Right, right, yeah.  Speaking of Celebrity Apprentice, I didn't feel good about Ant throwing me under the bus  or anything.  No?  No.  Uh-oh.  I've been doing a little research on my own here.  Did you put Iraq on an assignment?  Maybe. 
[02:31:30]  So, Penn, if you will, bear with me and just listen to this.  Thank you.  Trace has lived the life here, man.  The work ethic, the getting hurt on a real man's job.  Right.  The country music star.  Weapons charges.  Jesus Christ.  It's fantastic.  Are we going to tell Penn Jillette that we're not rooting for him anymore?  I know.  You already told him.  I'm all about, I'm all in with Trace now.  And this is fantastic.  Yeah.  You asshole.  Did I say that? 
[02:32:00]  And I saw.  I can't have Penn leaving here today thinking you're a good guy and I'm not.  I saw Trace, you know, because I had my sad moment.  Sad moment.  Yes, yes, yes.  And then the very next day I see Trace.  And I didn't hear your fucking piece of shit show.  So I'm in the green room with Trace.  And I go, so I heard you had a good time with ONA.  He said, yeah, thanks for getting me on that show.  That was really great.  And I go, I heard they kind of, he said, oh, your boys sold you out. 
[02:32:30]  He said, they are not your boys.  Let me tell you that right now.  Now, this, Trace is a friend of mine.  So Trace, a friend, is telling me, your boys, they're just sold you.  Boy, I don't remember saying that.  You can hear the tongue in cheek in there, right?  You can, right?  You can, right?  You've been trying that argument since you were eight, right?  You hear the tongue in cheek.  Has it ever worked?  No.  The I was just kidding, mom? 
[02:33:00]  I got to take an acting class.  No, he does that Wounded Warrior commercial.  You feel so good for him.  And he sings about the soldiers.  Oh, my God.  It's got a dry eye in the house.  What a great American.  Guys, this is not what's making me feel the best.  No.  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  You did come back today, though.  That's a good sign.  I did.  Okay.  Geez, we had it all settled out, and you had to throw that out there.  I was feeling good.  I was telling stories that had nothing to do with that. 
[02:33:30]  I know.  It was great.  Penn's got to go.  Elephant.  But, uh...  Oh, man.  They're saying you've got to go.  We would love to have you there for another half hour or so.  You guys have got to, yourselves.  You're going to check it out.  Fundanything.com.  There's only like three days.  There's some great stuff left.  One of the rewards we have is Jet Tilla, who's this fabulous chef who gave me cooking  lessons for this show, world-class chef.  If you give money to this movie, you can come over my house, and Jet and I will cook you  supper along with your friends. 
[02:34:00]  That sounds pretty cool.  You can come to the show.  We'll teach you magic.  Talk about how many tricks in the show is done afterwards.  I'll teach you to juggle.  We can hang out to the suites at the Rio, come by, and also huge chances to be in the movie.  I mean, you can also, we have a chance of you to put a friend of yours in as one of the  eight-by-tens that's held up as a corpse.  You can do that kind of stuff.  You can also put names in.  You can get your name in the movie.  We're also allowing, because the idea of the movie is that I do the director's commentary, 
[02:34:30]  also on the DVD, there's another 20 tracks.  We are letting people do their own director's commentary track over it that you can have  all set up.  This is such a way to involve people in this.  Yeah, we're all making the movie.  We're probably, you know, it's either L.A. or Vegas, but we're probably going to be shooting  it in Vegas, and there'll be a huge wrap party that everybody's invited to.  My band's going to play.  Everybody?  Great.  Everybody that's involved in the movie.  What about me and that?  Well, you're going to put money in the movie, aren't you?  Sold them out.  Right now.  I sure am.  You're better. 
[02:35:00]  That's right.  This is where you can come back.  I want to go there, and I can see who the contributors are.  I want to see you guys there for at least a Blu-ray package, maybe for a line, and come  back.  And maybe you could put, where they say the comments, you could say, with apologies to Trace  Atkins.  I am definitely, I'm going home, I'm going on the website.  What's the website again?  Fundanything.com, F-U-N-D-A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.com.  And then you'll see my picture there, but if you need to go right to it, it's slash pen, 
[02:35:30]  P-E-N-A.  And the podcast, which I just, I'm on it.  Oh, thank you, thank you.  I'm a huge fan of.  I did a real tough one last week.  I didn't hear it yet.  Yeah, it's real tough, because it was the day I found out Lou Reed died.  I was going to ask you about that really fast.  I know you've got to go.  I swear to you, we don't understand Lou Reed.  Yeah.  So give me a minute or two on Lou Reed.  I will.  I will.  What Lou Reed did was he synthesized the New York hardcore art scene, pop art scene, the 
[02:36:00]  Andy Warhol scene, added to that kind of Delmore Schwartz straightforward short story writing  that put a different point of view from rock and roll.  Rock and roll had, to that point, always been, I love you, my boyfriend did this, this happened.  But he brought in that kind of Delmore Schwartz straight recording, put really nice pop hooks  to it, and then brought in experimental noise music and put that all together. 
[02:36:30]  What you want in art, and I say this all over and over about director's cut, you know, the  crowdfunding thing, you want to have, in any art, the visceral and the intellectual collide  as hard as they can.  You want your mind and your guts to be fighting.  When you're on a roller coaster, your guts say, we're going to die right now.  And your intellect says, you know, if they killed someone every time, their insurance  rates would be too high. 
[02:37:00]  You know, and those two things fight, and that's where the joy comes.  Lou put together a band.  They were bands that did noise, you know, and there were smart bands, and there were  pop bands.  But he brought together the idea that smart people could be down and dirty.  And the combination of intelligence and simplicity really does create the whole punk move that's  going to go beyond that.  You know, when you listen to The Clash or any of those bands, you have this driving stupid,  you know, it's college kids meeting bikers, is what it really is. 
[02:37:30]  And Lou brought that together, used that monotone singing to give you the idea it was a short  story, and then took Phil Spector's wall of sound and turned it completely inside out and  turned it into something menacing as opposed to something comforting.  See, that's how I felt about the Bay City Rollers.  It was the same type of...  What song would you suggest by Lou Reed for people that don't know him? 
[02:38:00]  Well, you know...  Not Walk on the Wild Side, which we all know.  No, no, you all know Walk on the Wild Side, which is, you know, which is...  Give me one song, because I'm not...  I like a few of his songs, yes, but I don't go deep with Lou Reed.  Give me one.  I'm going to give you a hard one.  Okay.  I'll give you a really hard one.  It's 11 minutes long.  Okay?  It's a trilogy, and it's called Street Hassle.  Street Hassle.  Yeah.  And the first line of it is, that cunt's not breathing.  I think she's had too much or something or other.  Hey, man, you know what I mean.  It's about having a dead girl from drugs in the apartment and having to bring her out into  the street. 
[02:38:30]  That is a hassle.  Street Hassle.  And it breaks it into three parts.  And, just to bring a little jersey in, Springsteen does the little monologue in the center.  No kidding.  Street Hassle is so smart, so visceral, so powerful, and just so great.  And then I would also, you must listen to New York.  You know, the New York album, Romeo, Had a Juliet, and Dirty Boulevard.  Those songs, the narrator, you know, it's this nutty thing that Lou got to do. 
[02:39:00]  Everybody else, when there's huge, loud music behind them, would, of course, scream.  Yeah.  Everybody was a screamer.  And his idea of having this huge attack of sound and then going, and, you know, was  a really, I didn't really do that.  He's the first, this is the first time it's been put in this context.  But, you have to remember also, this is a big mistake.  Do you feel guilty now?  This is a big, this is a big, this is a big, big, this is a big, big, this is a big, big  moment right now. 
[02:39:30]  Is that if you listen to Lenny Bruce.  Right.  Right now.  The Carnegie Hall concert.  If you listen to that record, you will say, if you're honest, what's the big fucking  deal?  You're not that, not that funny, not that surprising.  I'm one of those guys.  Not that anything.  Right.  Because I love comedy.  So I, I, I listen to all Lenny Bruce stuff.  I don't get it.  Of course you don't.  And the lingo takes me out of it.  But you know, you know why you don't get it?  Yes.  It's because it's become everything around you.  Gotcha.  The idea of talking first person about your real life with the sadness and getting comedy 
[02:40:00]  out of that is invented by Lenny Bruce.  Yeah.  You do it every fucking day.  I would postulate you might not be doing it if not for Lenny.  But it becomes so absorbed into our culture that you can't see the novel.  That's not a big deal anymore.  At the time it sent him to jail, right?  You know, but when everybody else was coming on the stage and going, does your wife shop  too much?  He came on the stage and said, my wife filed for divorce today. 
[02:40:30]  And I was like, what are you talking about?  I mean, that's a huge difference.  His first person was real first person.  And, uh, he invented this American art form.  So Lenny Bruce, I love playing Lenny Bruce to, uh, people who are in their twenties and going,  what do you think of this?  Just a hack comic.  Nothing special.  Nothing special at all.  Well, let me tell you, you don't have George Carlin.  You don't have Pryor.  You don't have Louis C.K.  Yeah.  None of those people exist if not for this. 
[02:41:00]  So I agree with you.  If you're looking to just put on a Lenny Bruce record and just be taken away with it,  you're not going to get that.  You know, there's a famous quote from, um, from Brian Eno, and I won't get it word for  word.  That only 30,000 people or 3,000 people bought the first Velvet Underground record, but every  one of those people started a band.  Um, I mean, you don't have David Bowie without Lou Reed at all.  You don't have Iggy Pop without Lou Reed.  You certainly don't have Nirvana.  You certainly don't have any of the 90s stuff. 
[02:41:30]  Uh, you certainly don't have U2.  Uh, all of those people.  And they all acknowledge this.  I'm not saying that.  And the reason is, the balls it took to say, instead of talking about how I miss my girlfriend,  I'm going to talk about what I saw happening on the streets of New York.  Instead of talking about candidly, you know, sneakily about, we went to Itchikoo Park, we  got high.  Instead of doing that, I'm going to say, heroin, when the blood shoots up the dropper's neck, 
[02:42:00]  I feel just like Jesus' son.  You know, that kind of reporting is a whole different thing.  Right, yeah.  All of a sudden, it got really wicked real.  And, um, would someone else have come along and done that?  Almost certainly.  Mm-hmm.  But they, Lou did.  When you're the first.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lou was the first.  And, uh, you know, he's also, I must add, a very good friend of mine.  And, um...  You guys were close, huh?  Yeah.  Really, really smart.  And just rocked like a motherfucker. 
[02:42:30]  And such a sense of all that.  But it's exactly true.  If you'd have heard The Velvet Underground in 68, 69, your reaction would have been, what  the fuck is this?  Holy fuck, right, right.  You might have hated it.  Most likely would have hated it.  But you certainly would have got a, what the fuck?  Mm-hmm.  Now you hear it now and go, this sounds like every single thing on the radio.  And I would say, that's precisely my point.  Yeah.  Precisely my point, you know?  It's like when Debbie Harry came along, and all of a sudden, all beautiful women looked 
[02:43:00]  like Debbie Harry.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's because she brought that high cheekbone, beautiful look into it.  So, uh, Lou, Lou is the big one.  You've got live TV, Penn.  Sorry.  Live TV, I've been yelled at.  Yeah, their pants shaking its hands like, right.  Keep talking about fundanything.com.  And you guys will be part of it.  Thank you.  Is Trace doing a fundanything?  I'm kidding, Penn!  Let me say these really important words.  Yes.  You are forgiven.  Oh, thank you, Penn.  I love you.  Thank you, Penn.  And Trace is very seductive.  He's a friend of all of ours.  I know, right, isn't he? 
[02:43:30]  We've got a new friend, Penn.  Thanks so much, man.  Penn Jillette, everyone.  The great Penn Jillette.  Take it easy.  Love having Penn on.  Never disappoints.  Here he goes crunching away on the cereal on the floor.  So push it.  All right.  God damn.  Very cool.  I love Penn Jillette.  He sure can put things in perspective, can't he?  That Lou Reed speech was just amazing.  Fucking, uh, boy, he really has a way of...  I had a human moment there, like, oh, all right.  Maybe we should have talked to Penn before we did our thing with Lou Reed.  Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything about that.  How does it feel like?  It's a little weird.  Fuck him with Lou Reed's dead dick. 
[02:44:00]  I wasn't going to...  I don't know.  It was a friend of his.  See you in the end.  See you in the end.  I do love you.  I'll throw you under the bus when I'm not going to go that far.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  That was hilarious.  Oh, yes.  What I said was 20 times worse than the clip that you...  Oh, there was no refuting what I had said.  All right.  Where are we?  We got live readers.  Well, I want to talk to you about Crash and Burn, of course.  The, uh, new book from Artie Lang.  Comedian and radio personality, Artie Lang.  He shocked the world in 2008 when his book, Too Fat to Fish, it, uh, became a mega hit. 
[02:44:30]  Debuting at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.  One of the most successful stand-up gimmicks in the country.  Artie sold out, um, theaters.  Was heard by millions, of course.  But he was completely out of control.  Addicted to heroin.  Dangerously depressed.  And forever flirting with disaster.  Until the day, yes, he tried to take his own life.  Oh, boy.  Artie wouldn't appear on stage for the next year and a half and managed to lose everything. 
[02:45:00]  But what fans don't know is what happened next.  For the first time, Artie opens up, shares all the full truth behind his now legendary on-air meltdown.  His colorful and crazy stints in rehab and mental hospitals.  The most important, uh, thing, though, is the next chapter.  The wild, wild ride back.  Hilarious and heartbreaking.  Artie goes all in with a story that's shocking and funny.  Crash and burn by Artie Lang.  It's on sale as we speck and see.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:45:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Right now.  Damn, yo.  Oh, yes, Russell Peters.  Yes, just happens to be one of the biggest stand-up comedians in the world.  And he's got a brand-new comedy special, Notorious, premiering exclusively on Netflix.  The hour-long special was shot on Russell's recent world tour.

So don't miss Notorious and Russell Peters vs. the World,  now streaming only on Netflix. 
[02:46:30]  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dirty Boulevard.  Dirty Boulevard.  He lips out a window without glass.  I still don't like it. 
[02:47:00]  Well, I mean, you know, Penn put it very eloquently in everything.  I understand.  I just don't like it.  I think after Penn's explanation, I think I just became a huge Lou Reed fan.  Oh, man.  I'm not even joking.  That's crazy.  I'm going to go check out a lot of Lou Reed now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something I was going to say.  Oh, I was going to just say this.  Penn Jillette is great on our radio show.  I know.  Every fucking time. 
[02:47:30]  He rules.  He's never had a bad appearance.  No, he's never at a loss for words.  It's always interesting, fun stuff.  You know.  He knows how to say shit.  That's his whole thing.  He's like a carnival barker.  That's just amazing.  That fucking...  How good was the show?  Cow trick, man.  I want to see that.  The show was great.  His show is so much fun, man.  He's hilarious.  And the magic is really good.  I've always wanted to see a Penn Jillette show.  Yeah, it's good.  I got to get out to Vegas just to do that, I guess.  And you realize, and he doesn't ever try to, you know, fake it or anything. 
[02:48:00]  He Teller's the guy that, like, comes up with the fucking tricks and shit.  Right.  And Penn's the guy that makes it interesting.  If it was just Teller up there doing magic, you'd fucking...  The most amazing things, and you'd be yawning.  Right.  But Penn brings that whole entertainment dynamic to it.  Well, they understand they work very well together.  Absolutely.  So...  Yes, they're the Opie and Anthony of magic.  Ooh!  Anthony's a dirty fuck to go back on Penn like that. 
[02:48:30]  I know.  Hey, you know what?  I won't even deny it.  And then I tried the tongue-in-cheek thing, and he's on to that.  He's on to the whole thing.  He's on to everything.  He knew.  He knew.  Boy, my clip was ten times worse than yours.  Was it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I was too busy worrying about what I said.  You want to hear something really disgusting?  Uh-oh.  What?  Um, yesterday.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Is it disgusting, like gross disgusting, or disgusting, like ideologically disgusting? 
[02:49:00]  It's just gross.  Oh, okay.  You know...  You know, like interracial marriage or something.  You know, um...  Disgusting.  What?  The past few years, I've been talking about how you would do pretty much anything for your  kid.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a lot of parents out there correlate to doing anything for your kid.  Well, I had one of those I'll-do-anything-for-my-kid moments yesterday.  Oh, no.  Because I've heard parents talk about things with, you know, puke and shit and piss and 
[02:49:30]  snot and earwax and everything else that...  Let's play a little game.  And they go, as a parent, you know, yeah, that grosses you out when you think about it  before you have a kid.  But then afterwards, you know, it doesn't even bother you.  Uh...  Let's play a game.  Okay, let's play a game.  Try to figure it out.  Ask a couple questions.  All right.  I'm going to try to do it in the fewest amount of questions possible.  Okay.  Is it something that was involving, um...  Something below the belly button? 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Front or back of the body?  Back.  Oh, God.  Wow, you're really good at this game.  I had to quarter the child.  I quartered the child.  You're really good at this game.  You're really good at this.  Of course, it's...  It's shit. 
[02:50:30]  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  Shit.  Wow.  I'm trying to think.  Probably even...  I hope I don't get in trouble for this one, because we try to keep our kids as...  Yeah, but...  As private as possible.  No one's going to know.  Private citizens.  It's just a kid.  Then kids do.  So...  What happened?  My daughter, who's now one, is off the breast.  Oh.  And when it happens, when you're off the breast, you've got to give them the real milk.  And when you give them the real milk...  Oh, no.  We learned probably a little too late that it really binds them up. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Like constipation?  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  And she was struggling yesterday.  And we've seen, you know, my son struggle.  Struggle.  And what he could get done with his tiny little asshole, it's amazing.  I mean, it is amazing.  You can make money off that.  Just showing people what a little tiny...  Now, that's magic.  ...asshole could get done.  That's magic.  It's just amazing.  I can't possibly... 
[02:51:30]  You can't...  That's exactly what you think.  Like, there's no way that came from it.  Uh-huh.  And solid, so it's not even like it kind of, like, changed shape to get out of his body.  It's just amazing.  So yesterday, she's struggling really, really bad.  And sweating and turning red.  Oh, my God.  So I decide I've got to fucking, you know, do some exploring.  So I get her on the changing table and I...  Oh, no.  ...see what's going on.  No.  And there's only one way to say this, so... 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no.  She had a shit that was crowning.  Have you ever seen crowning videos?  Oh, my God.  Of women giving birth and the crowning is, of course, the head.  Right.  Is crowning, so it's like...  It's coming out.  Pushed out.  But there's no way that she's going to be able to get this out.  And then I'm feeling sort of on the sides.  I start by feeling on the sides and I can feel where the rest of this thing is. 
[02:52:30]  And it's a lot bigger than...  Yes.  Oh, no.  And she's crowning as best as she can.  I'm like, she's going to like...  This is going to be bad.  Oh, no.  So I had one of those I'll do anything for my kid moments.  Oh, no.  I got in there with my fingers and started digging it out.  And then you ate it?  Because...  And then you ate it, Sam.  I mean, I started with Vaseline because you got to start with Vaseline.  You're kind of hoping to lube up the area. 
[02:53:00]  Like trying to get a ring off your finger that's a little too tight.  Right, right.  Sure.  And I'm getting right in there.  Right in there.  Holy shit.  And that's not working.  So I finally determined the only way is to break this thing down myself.  Got to bust it up.  Bust it up.  I saw that.  That was...  What movie was that with Bruce Willis and the asteroid?  Armageddon?  Armageddon.  You got to fucking get in there.  You got to drill deep.  There you go.  You got to set the fucking bomb and blast that thing.  There you go.  Yes.  So I got in there with my pointer finger, the part that was crowning, and I just started 
[02:53:30]  like this.  Like scratching at it?  Yeah, chipping pieces away.  So you just kind of have to scoop it out.  Pretty much.  With your finger.  And I broke off some impressive pieces.  How solid was it?  Extremely solid.  I'm trying to think of...  So it wasn't like mushy where you like push it?  Not even close.  It was almost hard to break pieces off of it.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  So what you got to do as a parrot, Ed?  Well...  And you're going to have to do this with Beavis.  No.  One day, little Beavis is going to be constipated. 
[02:54:00]  If he's straining, I'll just squeeze his guts over the fucking box.  You're kind of a parrot right now.  No, I...  In a different way.  So Beavis is going to...  He might have one of these things that happen still.  If he had ever had any kind of blockage, he'd be at the vet.  Take him to the vet and go, look, sir.  Get your fingers in there.  You dig deep.  Right.  I was able to break a few pieces off to the point, and then, long story short, then she  was able to...  Did it come shooting out?  Not really.  She still had a struggle, but she got it out. 
[02:54:30]  And now we're on the concentrated prune juice.  I'm going to have to call you up after I have a night with a lot of Guinness.  Oh!  I hope I can use a hand here.  I couldn't...  See, I'm still smelling to see...  Oh, no!  I could not believe that I had to do that yesterday.  With the stench on your fingers for a while?  No.  No.  No?  She's going to scrub pretty good.  My nails are cut pretty good right now.  She make yourself a mustache for old time's sake.  Yeah!  Nah!  Oh, yeah!  Nah! 
[02:55:00]  How could something like that be formed?  Like, you see, like, the beautiful, sweet, innocent, little, tiny, adorable baby.  Mm-hmm.  How could something like that be formed in its tiny, little body?  It's...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Look, we could take a million calls now.  I mean, this is one thing that does amaze parents, what they could pass in their little  bodies.  You're like, get the fuck out of here.  No way did that just happen.  Because you'd think something like that would be stored up in your colon for years.  Right.  What does Laura do?  What...  Laura.  Laura.  Hey, how are you guys doing? 
[02:55:30]  Good.  Are you listening?  Yes, I'm listening.  Oh, you shouldn't have used your finger.  Why?  Because, this is something that's very common, but I give you a lot of power to do that.  But all you needed to do was just take a thermometer and put a little vaseline and just rub it around  the area, and she would have went.  But I give you a lot of power, because you're a better parent than I.  I had to do that with my son a long, long time ago when he was little, and we did it  with a thermometer.  I never would have thought of doing it with a finger, so... 
[02:56:00]  Couldn't you have dug it out with, like, a demitasse spoon or something?  You just kind of mine at it, like you're a little fucking strip mining?  I didn't want to use any instruments, because I was worried that the instrument would hurt  her, so I had to be really careful.  But a lot of it was crowding out.  Yeah, you could have dug in the middle, like, some pudding.  That's what I was doing, kind of like my finger, and the nail, I guess.  I guess, technically, I was using the nail to break it apart.  And I did use Vaseline around the area, but that wasn't working.  Here's a Sawzall.  Well, you just have to take the thermometer, and you just put a lot around the thermometer. 
[02:56:30]  I did all that.  This is great.  This is, like, why I'm just like, I, you know, the second, if a tad bit of nostalgic thought  comes into my head, or this thing like, you know, oh, I see my brother, and I see my sister  with a kid, and it's stories like this that I go, hallelujah!  I had a dream that you had a kid.  Whoa!  It just, I just remembered.  How was that?  You were really happy, and you were hanging out with your brother and sister with their 
[02:57:00]  kids.  Yeah?  I swear to God, I just had this memory.  Yeah, and you guys all got together with your kids.  Wow, that's fucked up.  All right, Laura, thank you.  Did it get under your fingernail?  I don't know if it did.  If he was scraping with his fingernail, it had to.  I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's say hi to Drew really fast, and then we got a big star on hold.  Drew, what's up?  Fast on hold.  Well, look, the last time I stuck my pinky finger up a butthole, it ended up in a nightmare. 
[02:57:30]  What?  All right.  Yeah, man.  Should have gone to the big star, I think.  We're going to go right to the big star.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, sir.  That was a prime example of a horrible fall.  But he thought he was awesome.  He thought he was awesome.  He thought he was awesome.  Jim Jeffries, what's up, brother?  Oh, Jim.  G'day, guys.  We've had you booked here and there for the last week, and I apologize for that.  That's all right.  I've been on hold here for about five minutes, and the first sentence I heard was,  what he could do with his little arsehole you could make money off. 
[02:58:00]  That's caramity.  Have you had any situations with your young son yet?  I had to dig out poo from my daughter's butt.  No, my son seems to be more evolved than your children.  Yeah, none of that gross stuff.  I just leave it in there.  I've seen him get constipated.  You give him baby laxatives the same way, same stuff they cut cocaine with.  Well, but this poo was already formed. 
[02:58:30]  That's the problem.  I guess if it was all coming out already, what are you going to do?  Yeah, it's already formed.  It's already formed.  You've got to get that one out, and then you do the right thing, and now she's on a nice  regimen, so hopefully that won't happen again.  Oh, God.  No, I don't know how or why.  My son already has a gaping arsehole.  Just follow it.  Gaping.  Jesus.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You've got something going on, huh?  Carnegie Hall.  Jim Jeffries.  Carnegie Hall.  How's that? 
[02:59:00]  Carnegie Hall.  November 9th is coming up, and there's still about 300 tickets left, which isn't me.  It will sell out, but I'd like to sell out a bit before.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, you would like to not have to worry about the ticket sales and just focus on the  gig itself.  So let's get tickets for Jim Jeffries, man.  Carnegie Hall, Saturday, a week from Saturday.  Okay.  Very funny.  I'm thinking it's Friday, because we're taking tomorrow off.  So a week from this Saturday, Jim Jeffries at Carnegie Hall.  You can get the tickets through carnegiehall.org. 
[02:59:30]  I assume.  That's okay.  I assume.  I assume.  You really calmed down, huh?  As far as partying and stuff and going out?  Well, no.  At the moment, I'm back drinking every now and again, but at the moment, we're filming  season two legit.  Right.  And so it's, you know, I can't really, because we're working so hard.  Yeah, yeah.  Talking about legit, I don't know if I mentioned this last time, we got George Lazenby, he's 
[03:00:00]  got to play my dad.  Hey, wait a minute.  Didn't he play, what, James Bond or something?  Yeah, he was James Bond for one movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And the thing is, he was like the best looking male model in 1968.  68.  Every time you're hanging out with him, he's always talking about, oh, you know, we used  to have these orgies, you know, John Lennon's cock would be there.  Peter Sellers' cock would be there.  Yeah, there'd be a few, I said, if you'd ever fuck the Bond girl, he goes, it'd be easier 
[03:00:30]  for me to tell you which ones I haven't fucked.  He goes, they all come to the conventions, so I think he hasn't fucked them in their prime.  I think he hasn't.  Oh, you think he's fucking them, like, from the conventions, so.  Oh, man.  I think he fucks them and there's just a pile of headshots next to each other, all half-signed.  Like, yeah, just some old broads waxing fantastic about the old days while they fucking have 
[03:01:00]  Viagra sex.  Yeah.  God damn.  And Carrie Fisher's doing a cameo.  Oh.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Carrie Fisher.  We had her on once.  She's wild.  But it's that weird thing, no matter what she looks like now or whatever, I haven't seen  her in anything for years, but I mean, you know, there's a bit of me that wants to,  when she shows up, just go, oh, there's been a wardrobe change, you'll be wearing this  gold slate.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a Star Wars fan, obviously, right?  Yeah, I like Star Wars, yeah.  What do you think of J.J. Abrams, this whole thing?  What do you think it's going to be?  I think it will be better.  I'm pretty excited.  Yeah, it's kind of, look, I like the new Star Trek, some of those Star Trek.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think it'll be the same.  I don't want CGI in anything anymore, and I don't give a fuck about 3D either.  No.  No, you don't. 
[03:02:00]  You don't give a fuck about 3D, or you don't like a lot of CGI?  I like little tiny models, and I like puppets.  Puppets.  You know what I mean?  Like when Yoda was a puppet.  You're a child.  When Yoda was a puppet, you believe that Yoda exists, right?  But when Yoda's got like two lightsabers, and he's jumping around like a maniac, you  go, well, that's not fucking real.  I didn't like that at all.  I didn't like when he's jumping around like a maniac and stuff.  I did kind of like him when he was just the puppet with the little cane and stuff 
[03:02:30]  walking around.  But I think as far as the space battles go, and especially with J.J. Abrams, that looks  fucking awesome in Star Trek.  And I think it'll look...  I think his version of CGI space battles is really good for Star Wars.  I think it'll look better than when Lucas did it.  I don't know.  So I like when the models, and you can watch the extra features, and they pull the wings  apart with a bit of fishing wire.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  It's like a...  And the Death Star was made out of bits of battleship pieces.  That's what you watch.  That's when movie making was still a craft.  Yeah, but you know what?  It worked back then, but now you'd kind of look at it and just be like, when you watch  the original Star Wars, and they're coming in over the Death Star, and you could tell  it's just like firecrackers going off on a big model.  I don't know.  That's what I don't get.  They go, the new Star Wars, or the new whatever.  They go, this is a $300 million movie.  What?  Once you've got the fucking computer program, it should be like five bucks. 
[03:03:30]  You're right.  It was more expensive with the model makers and stuff, I would assume, right?  It has to be.  You have no idea the painstaking length they go to.  What?  Fuck off.  They're animators.  Yeah, once you have the program, it kind of makes itself, doesn't it?  Yeah.  As long as you're good at using DOS or whatever the program is, I don't know.  I'm not computer savvy.  DOS.  Yeah.  Sorry, guys. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Hey, have you ever, I know you back off from partying and stuff when you're filming the  show, the TV show, but did you have to learn that or make a decision after you maybe went  in hungover or something?  Yeah, I was drunk through the whole pilot, and then I got a girl off that pregnant, so  that was a pretty easy decision.  No, I came up with a theory the other day, which was, okay, in my life, I've partied 
[03:04:30]  and then I've partied.  You know what I mean?  Like, my girlfriend tells stories about when she used to date a guy from the Miami Heat  and she went out with Madonna and Dennis Rodman and it all ended with drugs and sex, right?  Jesus.  And then I'm just sitting there going, just shut up.  Just shut up.  Don't even tell me this story.  And she's like, why, you've partied?  And I go, no, I've gotten wasted.  Right, right.  I've never truly partied.  I go, oh, my partying ends around a coffee table with five guys trying to do coke and 
[03:05:00]  one guy at the end playing a conspiracy and us all thinking at 5.30 where chicks might  be.  Right.  Not fucking basketball players, goddammit.  Yeah, it's like, a few times in my life when I really partied was involved like hookers  and like a limousine in Vegas and all that type of stuff.  Yeah.  I've woken up and I've gone.  If you really party, you wake up and go, hell, that was, well, geez, we partied last night.  That cost us two, that cost me $2,000, right? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But when a girl wakes up and goes, I really partied last night, I just made $2,000.  That's a big difference.  Yeah.  Like, if a girl really party, she'll profit.  Right, right.  Boy, and you just, you don't want to hear those stories either.  No, I don't.  There's some center, but yeah, no, I don't want to hear that story.  You know, my cock can never live up to that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I'll never, sort of, some NBA player.  Not even if, even if my cock was the same size, just the enthusiasm level of a professional athlete.  Yeah.  She was with black guys?  Um, that's what the story sounds like.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, no.  Oh, you can't be friends with Anthony anymore.  She's wrecked.  That's a big no-no in Ant's world.  A big no-no.  That's like my first question I ask a girl before her name. 
[03:06:30]  Have you ever been with a black guy?  I'm terrible.  And if the answer echoes back to you, you know, she's lying.  Yeah.  See, because her vagina's big.  Yeah, she's like a cave, you see.  If anyone's in the car with the kids right now, that's going to take a big explain.  Yeah, exactly.  Jim Jeffries, when are you coming into New York?  Are you here already?  I'm filming on the Friday, so I'm coming in on the red-eye that night, and then I'm straight 
[03:07:00]  doing Carnegie Hall.  God, man.  I'm back on Sunday.  Bizzing.  That's crazy.  You would think if you're playing Carnegie Hall, they would give you a break and let you  get here early and relax a little bit.  Yeah, you'd think that, but, you know, no, that's not the case.  It really is going to be an amazing show.  I already told you, Jim.  I can't wait.  I'm going to this one.  I've got to see you at Carnegie Hall.  Jim Jeffries, Carnegie Hall, week from Saturday, November 9th at 8 p.m., carnegiehall.org for tickets. 
[03:07:30]  Very cool.  And, of course, it's Jim Jeffries on Twitter with the two Fs.  The two, the three E's and the two Fs, and the picture of me.  Very complicated.  All right, yeah, it's J-E-F-F-E-R-I-E-S.  E-F-E-S.  Yeah.  Okay.  Jim, thanks for calling, and we'll see you at Carnegie Hall.  Thanks, guys.  See you again. 
[03:08:00]  All right, man.  We'll see you soon, buddy.  Thanks, mate.  All right.  Jim Jeffries, everyone.  Here goes our pal Jim Jeffries from a faraway land.  Yeah, big fucking star in Hollywood now.  I know, right?  That son of a bitch.  I went out with him a couple of times, and man.  We all have.  Holy fuckaroni.  That guy can't.  Were you able to keep up?  Yeah, quite honestly.  He's an animal.  I was, but, boof.  Yeah, he likes.  He's an animal.  You remember the show he came in the day after St. Patrick's Day? 
[03:08:30]  St. Patrick's Day.  With that guy, who I guess is really famous, and we didn't know.  Yeah.  He was rolling on the molly.  I think he might have been.  He was rolling.  They were fucking.  Yeah.  That was a fun day.  They were fun.  They were out of their minds, paranoid, just sitting here with us.  And then Justine Jolie showed up, and he said he wanted to eat the shit out of an  asshole with a knife.  Oh, that was the same day?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, okay.  Oh, yeah.  That was bad.  Because I was about to say that it was, I don't even remember if it was a good appearance,  but if he did that on that show, yes, of course it was. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, it was fantastic.  Awesome appearance.  Yeah.  He just railed her.  Right.  Wouldn't stop.  Well, she kind of needed us.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  She was getting a little too big-headed around us for some reason.  When, like, the first couple times she came in, she was beyond cool.  And then something changed.  Maybe because E-Rock basically fucking assaulted her.  Oh, when he punched her or something?  Yeah, he punched her in the mouth or something.  I don't know.  I think it was the jaw.  Yeah, it was the jaw, right, E-Rock?  I don't think that was what happened.  My favorite was the stripper girl or whatever porn star that cried, came in here and started 
[03:09:30]  crying.  Which one?  That one that...  Oh, we've had a few.  Yeah.  That we showed her the photos of her.  Oh, Shauna Lene.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Performing in what she performs in.  Because I thought she was, like, probably one of the hottest girls we ever got crying.  I thought you meant after she started crying.  Oh, I thought...  You mean as far as the girls that cry on the show?  Yeah, yeah.  She was pretty fucking hot.  Yeah, by far the hottest girl that was caught on our show.  The hottest girl we ever made cry.  Jesus. 
[03:10:00]  Do you remember in the first year on Satellite, we had some porn girl in and you kept insisting  that she might be pregnant because she was sick?  Oh, all right.  And then she started crying and then she went to the bathroom and then we found out she  left.  Yeah, but wasn't that like a major...  Wasn't that like Carmen Luvana or something?  Or Jesse Jane or something?  Yeah, it was one of them.  Big name.  Yeah.  Big name.  I don't know.  Well, it's not like we tore apart.  They're all pink on the inside.  Good one-o.  I don't see names.  I don't care.  It's not like Jenna Jameson. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, it was Jesse Jane.  You guys fucking tore her apart.  That's true.  She did cry in the studio.  And a little follow-up, I guess there was a press release that she just stopped promoting  her book.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she's done.  They said, well, she's going to take a little time to stop because she's, you know, exhausted.  Yeah, she's got to get some rest.  She was apparently sleeping in the green room before her interview with Jim and I, so obviously  she was tired.  She absolutely was.  Do you think that's secret rehab?  Do you think that she's going to go rehab? 
[03:11:00]  I hope so.  Something like that?  Honestly, I hope so.  And of course, Chris Brown.  She claims she's not on anything.  Yeah, well, good luck.  Chris Brown in rehab, huh?  Yeah, he's getting his head together.  The old, you know, then it's a gag that we've talked about on this show plenty of times.  It's the fake, uh, people are mad at you for something you did, so you go into rehab.  And then everything's okay.  It doesn't mean anything.  Right.  He doesn't want to go.  He doesn't think he's got a problem.  But you do this, so it's a PR move, you know?  This Chris Brown's a real piece of shit, by the way. 
[03:11:30]  I think so.  Just a real fucking, he's got a fucking anger problem.  It's obvious.  He's a piece of shit.  And any of these fucking team breezy, dumb douchebag women that hop on his bandwagon  and defend him, you're all a bunch of dopes.  You're dopes.  Because he would crack you in the fucking face as quick as fucking Guy Fieri would suck a dick.  Whoa, wait, what? 
[03:12:00]  What?  This is so alleged.  Wow.  We have no idea.  It's my opinion.  What are you going to say?  What are you going to say, you know?  It's all absurdity for humor's sake.  Guy Fieri's a friend of the show.  Is he?  Yes.  Of course he is.  I think he is.  Hey, we're very diverse.  We get friendships from anybody.  Gay, straight, whatever.  Exactly.  Yes.  Just absurdities for humor's sake.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go home.  I got some trick-or-treating to do today.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Is it going to rain today?  Is it raining now? 
[03:12:30]  I don't know.  Rain will cut down on the pain.  I don't think it's raining yet.  It's just very foggy out.  Is it going to be a shitty, rainy Halloween day?  Sure.  What time do you start trick-or-treats?  Well, I got to get to Philly first.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, Philly.  Philly.  God damn.  God damn Philly.  God damn Philly.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  I'm from Philly.  I'm a tough guy.  Fuck him.  Perfect for Halloween.  Yeah.  It's not supposed to start raining until 7 p.m.  You sure?  But that's exactly what...  Isn't that when... 
[03:13:00]  That's good for us.  Oh, you go out...  Oh, because you go out...  Yeah, we'll be on the stoop having a beer by then.  You know what's bad about that?  The little kid?  Well, sure.  You got to start them early, especially, you know...  Do it natty ice.  Especially if you're in Philly.  Yeah.  I love a natty ice.  Drunk, degenerate.  That's bad for the toilet papering.  If kids TP the trees and stuff, and then it rains on it, it makes it so much harder  to clean up because it falls apart, it gets on there.  And it was bad for one kid.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't even get to the story.  Teen shot while toilet papering principal's house. 
[03:13:30]  All this reminded me of is fucking Back to the Future.  You're a slacker in Back to the Future 2.  Yeah.  When fucking...  What was his name?  Lee...  I can't even remember his name.  I keep thinking of Lee.  Lee Harvey Oswald.  Lee Leland.  No, it was...  No, it was Lee Harvey Oswald.  Strickland.  Strickland.  Strickland.  When he comes out and greets Marty in the alternate universe there with a shotgun.  And he's ready to shoot him.  And that's all I'm thinking is like, wait a minute.  This is just like this fucking story. 
[03:14:00]  Kid tries to TP the house.  He's a slacker.  His father was a slacker.  He's going to be a slacker too.  And he gets shot.  Or shot at.  I guess they arrested the principal.  He can't do that.  Yeah, he can't really shoot students.  They frown on shooting the students?  They kind of do.  Fucking crazy.  Kid was trying to TP his house.  Don't have a problem if the students are doing the shooting, but if you shoot...  No, no.  You shoot at them first.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like to kind of stand your ground thing.  Hey, you know what?  Orange is the new black.  Wow.  Jesus.  Oh, E-Rod, thanks. 
[03:14:30]  So, not like my fucking...  Not like I try to go to sleep where it feels like I put two seashells up to my ears each night.  Holy shit, my tinnitus.  I had to switch players.  I didn't adjust.  Terrible.  What?  Exactly.  It doesn't matter.  D-Roc's board goes to 11.  I'm losing my hearing too.  What?  Sucks.  What?  Huh?  My mother-in-law gives me a hearing test.  Really?  She did one day because she was convinced I was deaf.  And she had it work out.  She actually said, oh, thank God.  I just like tuning people out. 
[03:15:00]  I've heard a little bit.  You know that deal.  I know.  I tune out a lot of people, especially because we do this for a living.  The last thing we want to do is listen after 10 o'clock.  I find myself not wanting to listen at all for the rest of the day.  Yeah.  Because you have to listen for four straight hours.  And yeah, of course, at times we're not listening and blah, blah, blah.  But that's really important.  So I'd like to rest that part of my brain and not listen.  You know there's a sound frequency that you can't hear once you're over, like, 20 years old? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  And they play it throughout the malls sometimes really loud because the shoppers won't hear it and everything.  But it's supposed to keep the kids away if they don't want kids loitering.  No.  Yeah, yeah, it's fucked up.  Your hearing starts degrading by that point.  So it's like some fucking high-pitch frequency that, uh...  Is that it?  Yeah, I can hear it.  Oh, turn the volume up. 
[03:16:00]  Turn the volume up on this.  See if we can hear it.  I hear that.  Wait.  No, you don't.  I swear to God.  You really don't hear that?  I hear that.  I hear that.  For real.  Play it again.  Hold on.  Stop it and make it go again.  I could hear so slightly this sound.  I hear...  Is it a tone?  Thank God. 
[03:16:30]  Wait, wait.  Is it a tone?  Is it to go beep?  No, it's...  You don't hear me doing anything?  Like, I was just...  The whole time you were talking, turning it off and on, off and on, off and on.  You can't hear that?  Play it again.  You don't even hear the clicks?  No, I hear the clicks.  Okay.  I hear there's supposed to be something there because this is very...  It's so low that it goes like...  You don't hear it now?  I was playing it over you while you were talking.  No.  Wow.  I swear I could hear it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, I could hear it.  I'm very happy that I could hear that.  What does it sound like?  It's very high-pitched.  It's a high-pitched tone.  You cringe a little bit.  Yeah, it's a little uncomfortable.  It's not a straight tone?  It's not like a...  Yeah, it's a straight tone.  It's going like...  Yeah, but a very high frequency.  Play it again.  You can't hear that.  No.  Wow.  Holy fuck, that is so weird.  There's nothing there.  Why can I...  Why am I able to hear it?  Holy shit.  So I'm an older gentleman.  You're young at heart.  Well, you're in your early 20s or late 20s. 
[03:17:30]  What do you hear?  Nothing.  When I'm talking, nothing.  Oh my...  When I listen very closely, I hear this, literally.  Here's what I hear.  Let's hear.  Just like that.  Did you hear it through...  Do you talk in there?  No.  Oh my god.  No, no, no.  I hear the clicks, but I don't hear a sound.  It's playing right now?  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  I swear, I don't fucking hear it.  It's so weird. 
[03:18:00]  So why is it certain people of a certain age?  Because I definitely hear it.  I guess the hearing is supposed to degenerate so that you can't hear...  I think...  I never cleaned the wax out of my ears, and I think that has saved me.  And now I refuse to clean the wax out of my ears, because I feel like it's insulating  my hearing and saving me.  It doesn't clog your ears?  What?  Clog.  Clog?  It doesn't clog.  Oh, you heard that, huh?  Clog.  Yeah, I heard that.  You have to talk in that fucking frequency.  I'm almost there. 
[03:18:30]  That's why.  Entertainment Weekly.  I know.  And the rest of the world...  We're kind of done with the show, and now we're just, like, you know, kind of just...  Chilling?  Chilling, doing small talk.  Wow.  The rest of the world...  Like, I don't know how they ever get letters.  Yeah.  I got caught in this Sudoku thing.  I got to, like, send out, like, science Sudoku puzzles.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sending one to, like, Belfast.  Belfast.  And instead of having, like, a zip code, it's like BT1, but then there's a space, 2DY, Northern 
[03:19:00]  Ireland, UK.  Like, how is it...  That's never going to get there.  Really?  Why wouldn't you, like, adopt our number system?  They had that shit in England, too.  What is BT1...  And it's not...  And then it doesn't continue.  BT1 space 2DY mean.  That's their zip code.  You hear it now?  No.  It's so weird.  It's so weird.  My high frequency is gone.  And it was from years of the band, and then...  Thank God it's... 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Thank God I still got it after all these years of radio.  And probably my job, too, because I used a lot of heavy equipment, tools, a lot of those  fucking, like, jackhammer things and fucking sawzalls and hammer drills.  Right.  So a lot of that shit just fucked my hearing up.  Oh, man.  I hope this gets there.  There's no way this is getting there.  Northern Ireland.  We have fans of Northern Ireland?  What the fuck is this about?  How come I can't hear that, but I hear a fucking... 
[03:20:00]  I hear the tone in my ear from tinnitus.  Yeah, is that fucked up?  Yeah.  You would think that you wouldn't be able to hear that at all.  Yeah, why can't I not hear that?  Do you hear this?  It's playing.  It was playing.  I didn't hear it.  It still is playing.  It's still playing.  Oh, it's still...  No.  No, no.  Now it's stopped.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Oh, I'm a happy man today.  But that is a tone that most people, um...  What?  Can hear?  I don't know.  I'd love to hear it.  I mean, I heard it.  Eric can hear it. 
[03:20:30]  Opie heard it.  Where's my mailboy?  I can't hear it.  He's coming.  Could you turn it up real loud?  Turn that sound up real loud.  Turn the computer up.  Oh.  Over there, as high as it'll go.  Turn the sound up real loud.  Oh, it's as high as it'll go?  Yeah.  It's been really loud for me.  That's loud.  Is it?  Wow.  No.  Sal, can you hear that?  Sal, put headphones on.  Oh, yeah.  You can hear it. 
[03:21:00]  I swear I can hear it.  I know you can hear it.  How loud is it, though?  Maybe I don't hear the whole thing.  I mean, it's loud.  It's like 18K?  What is 18K?  I don't know what he's talking about.  Thank you.  This is why it's mailman.  How loud is this?  In general terms.  No, no.  18K is the frequency.  I don't care.  How loud is this?  It depends.  It depends on how loud you have the headphones on.  There's no actual...  How loud do you hear this?  Loud.  Like pretty loud.  How?  Like it's almost distracting. 
[03:21:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Let me turn my headphones on.  Yeah.  See, I hear it low.  I'm playing it real loud now.  My headphones are loud.  Go.  Oh!  Yeah, yeah.  That hurts now.  That was...  You can hear that now?  I cranked it up real loud in my headphones.  And it's like...  It hurts.  It's a little piercing.  Yes.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  We got to go home.  Jesus.  Happy Halloween.  Happy Halloween.  Happy, happy.  Happy Halloween.  I'm bummed I'm missing your party. 
[03:22:00]  Have fun there.  Oh, yes.  The big party.  I'll probably wind up putting that like I usually do on Life from the Compound on Ustream.  So just go to Ustream.com and just put in fucking Life from the Compound.  You'll find me.  And people come down.  They do shows in the studio.  I put cameras out during the hijinks and shenanigans.  And it's usually a lot of fun.  So people can live vicariously through it.  Last time you did this, Bobo threw up.  Bobo, last party. 
[03:22:30]  Bobo threw up.  The show went on until the wee hours of the morning with various drunken people saying horrible  things about people.  So tune in.  Generally, it doesn't get rebroadcast.  No, it's a one and done.  It's a one off.  Because it's just very politically incorrect.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Have fun.  Happy Halloween.  We'll be watching that.  Maybe I'll tune in from Philly.  Oh, sure.  It'll be like I'm there or something.  Yes.  What?  You didn't read that.  Oh.  I just threw the readaway.  Oh, click on my What's My Name video. 
[03:23:00]  I like that one a lot.  Some lunatic New York City lady trying to return $9 of sweet potatoes.  Yelling and screaming.  And demanding that the person knows her name.  It's not like the fat lady that was pissed at the truck that was idling in the parking  lot.  The diesel truck.  And she came up.  She came out of a Prius and she's like, you leave it in the exhaust that's going in my  window.  What a bitch.  Really? 
[03:23:30]  I got that DM to me a couple of times.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Fucking.  Is it good?  You want to smack her in the head.  She's just a fat cunt.  I think it's one of our listeners, too.  Really?  I don't know.  That's how it was tweeted to me.  I just didn't have time to click on it yet.  But it's basically saying he knows the problem.  The person that filmed it, supposedly.  Eh, fuck it.  I'm just going to tell you about Orange's new Black House of Cards.  The rest of development.  When's this airing?  Do I have to just...  You ready for the next big thing from Netflix?  Prepare yourself.  Oh, it's airing.  It's on Netflix right now.

Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Who are you guys?  I'm curious.  Late 20s.  Why? 
[03:25:00]  Watch out now.  The Open Anthony Show continues.  Sort of.  After O&A Live with Sam Roberts.  It's next.  This is After Open Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  The cleanup continues.  As does the show.  It's After Open Anthony Live.  Call us up.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  You can call right now. 
[03:25:30]  And if you're sitting there listening to your radio going,  why the fuck are they vacuuming during a radio show?  Boy, did you miss a show today.  How's it going over there, Sal?  You getting it done?  He can't hear me.  You getting it done over there?  I said, how's it going over there, buddy?  Going good.  What are you, vacuuming the wall, I see?  There's just shit everywhere.  It's crazy.  Roland, how are you doing?  A little bit of a headache.  Why do you have a headache?  Because I got shit held in my head. 
[03:26:00]  Okay, well, what happened today?  Sal's actually now vacuuming the console, like technology.  He's taking our Apple TV devices.  See, Sal's the thing.  I held back by not throwing shit.  Well, what happened today was some guy sent us a giant package.  We were talking about Guy Fieri and the fight that he got into with his hairstylist.  Do you know anything about that, Roland?  I don't.  So weird, isn't it?  Very mysterious.  So Guy Fieri gets into it.  I just figured I'd ask in case you knew. 
[03:26:30]  You know, you never know when Roland has a little nugget of information.  Sometimes he doesn't know anything.  I know nothing.  Sometimes.  I see nothing.  I hear nothing.  Okay, so maybe he does know something, and we'll find that out as the days progress.  However, we're talking about Guy Fieri, and all of a sudden Kenny brings this giant box into the room.  I gave it to him.  I should never give it to him.  You gave him the big box?  It was a mail.  It came in yesterday.  Yuri dropped the...  We call you Jack, right?  Yuri.  Jack dropped the vacuum cleaner. 
[03:27:00]  Yuri Jack.  No, Yuri Jack.  This would be the great time to do Steven Singer's read.  Because he came from somebody who works from Apple, so I thought it was somebody giving him technology goodies.  Eric, can you reprint out my reads?  They're gone.  Yeah, I'll be right there.  Um, you thought it was technology in the box.  Because it's somebody who works at Apple.  Well, we opened the box, and as it turned out, it's not somebody who works for Apple.  It's somebody who knows about Apple and just put the logo on his return address.  I saw it.  I didn't pay attention to that yesterday.  You didn't.  What happened was, uh, I think I have two. 
[03:27:30]  No, no, no, I have two today.  No, I know you have two.  Um, what happened was, we get this box, and it's a huge box, and this guy sent the show.  He sent 12 to 15 boxes of cereal, and he sent all the different Count Chocula, Boo Berry, all those cereals.  Ghetto.  And he sent the, and a bag of ghetto cereal.  And he sends a three-page letter explaining that Count Chocula doesn't taste as good anymore. 
[03:28:00]  And we're all like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Like, what are you, this is, it was the craziest thing maybe we've ever gotten in the mail.  Jesus Christ, that's a loud vacuum.  It's because the hose is on it.  Um, so what happened...  Vacuum two.  Huh?  And we got a second vacuum coming in.  So what happened was, Anthony went to the bathroom, he decided to take a shit,  and Opie got a little rambunctious, and he started opening boxes of cereal and throwing them at Roland. 
[03:28:30]  Open.  So cereal just went everywhere.  And he wasn't just throwing the box.  Like, he'd take the box and fling it in Roland's general direction.  Of course, there'll be video posted at some point today on Opie's YouTube channel.  But Roland just got covered in cereal.  His clothes had cereal dust all over him.  Cereal all over the console.  Cereal all over the floor.  We've actually had to take all the furniture that's in the studio and move it to the hallway.  I went to the bathroom to wash all my eyes because I had cereal dust. 
[03:29:00]  You had cereal dust in your eyes.  Yeah, like, what the fuck?  How many boxes of cereal did he throw at you?  Six or seven.  Six or seven boxes.  And when I say throw, he's not throwing the actual box.  He's heaving.  He's holding the box and just flinging it so that all the cereal, a full box of cereal,  I don't need to yell anymore.  There's no vacuum.  It's sailing over the console and into Roland's face.  Like, he covered this studio with cereal.  The only good part is that Luke Skywalker pin hit me in the head from Lucky Charms. 
[03:29:30]  So now I have the Luke Skywalker edition.  You have to keep the toy inside the box of cereal for yourself.  That's the only positive I took out of this.  Sal, I see you're bringing the furniture back in.  Do you think it's ready?  Only that section.  The console's still fucked.  The console's still fucked.  Yeah, the console's completely marshmallow dust all over it.  And then we've got to wipe down, we've got to Lysol wipe everything because if you put  any moisture on that dust, it's just immediately sticky again.  Right, right, right.  We've got to do this right, you know.  Now, you did not retaliate, Roland.  No, because I'm not foolish. 
[03:30:00]  Obi was saying, Roland, don't be a pussy.  Throw some cereal back at me.  Oh, Jack.  Throw some cereal back.  Roland was saying, I'm not going to do it.  And I said, Roland, don't be a pussy, you've got to throw it back.  And Roland said, Sam, I'm not going to do it.  Why didn't you want to throw cereal back at Opie?  Because that...  Wait, did you want to?  I wanted to lunge.  And throw everything, and possibly I could get my paws on.  You wanted to...  I wanted to rip the TV off and just throw it, just to laugh.  You wanted to throw your body at Opie.  I just wanted to rip the TV off and just throw it.  You looked angry the first time he did it, because it was unexpected. 
[03:30:30]  Yes.  That got you very mad.  Because it hit my eye in a hurry.  Well, it's one of those things where it's like somebody is making fun of you, and it's  like, okay, it's all in good fun, it's all in good fun.  Then all of a sudden they walk behind you and smack you in the back of the head.  That rage fills your body.  It does.  And there was a rage I saw.  There was.  Now, when he continued to do it, did it make you feel like, okay, it's just a joke now?  Or did it make you get more angry and more angry?  I was wondering if I could rip off the Sony TV and throw it.  Okay, so more angry is the answer. 
[03:31:00]  You wanted to tear the studio apart.  You wanted to basically do what Carrie did at the prom.  You wanted the entire room to fall down on top of Greg Opie Hughes at that moment.  On top of everybody, so I go, even Stevens.  What's even Stevens about that?  What did everybody else do?  Call me pussy, so I'm like, you're coming down with me.  So you wanted to go down with the flames.  The whole body, so people cry, my legs are stuck.  Like, that's right.  That's right.  Are you a pussy now?  You want to hear all the pain.  Yes.  Like, you don't sacrifice yourself if it means hearing everybody else's pain.  That'll make me happy. 
[03:31:30]  Okay.  Somebody hurts Roland emotionally, he hurts them physically.  Right.  And we gradually need to learn not to hurt each other at all.  Now, why didn't you actually do anything?  Because I know the guy down the hall.  Who's the guy down the hall?  You're talking about Tim Sabian who's in charge of our channels now?  Him and the bigger bosses.  Okay.  I just pictured in my head seeing to them saying, well, he told me to throw it at him.  And then they have like a $20,000 bill in front of them and just staring at me saying, you're an asshole. 
[03:32:00]  So you're worried about marshmallow dust sprinkling into the board.  I was told that if it gets onto the board and the sugar gets hot, the knobs can get sticky, stuck, and then they have to call a guy to fix it.  And it could take a week to get this one particular person here.  Well, Roland, what are you going to do if I throw this?  I'm just kidding.  There's one more box of cereal.  I would have dragged your head across Fifth Avenue.  See, with Roland, I don't actually employ him.  I don't have any power over him.  So if I decided to just jump on the bandwagon, my little one box of cereal, he would get back at me not only for every box of cereal that was thrown at him today, 
[03:32:30]  but for every guest that's ever been said no to, for every joke that's ever been made at his expense.  Translation today.  Yeah, this would be my death.  Yeah, probably.  Probably.  But since his name's on the wall, El Jefe always wins.  Yeah.  But Roland's smart, because remember when Ope spilt Cheerios on the K-Rock board?  Yeah.  They had to replace half the board while the show was on.  Yeah, but Ope didn't get punished for that. 
[03:33:00]  No, because he's the boss.  He's like, it's Ope and Anthony.  He's the boss.  Roland's called replaceable.  Is that right?  Upstairs.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I don't want to sit down and go, again, another one?  Get the fuck out of here.  Okay, now, we have one intern who...  Oh, shit.  You're wrong.  This was the intern who I forgot his name before, and I still don't remember.  Tyler.  Tyler.  Taylor Taylor.  Can I tell you something that's sincere?  Yeah.  I was about to call him Connor.  Connor is what I thought his name was.  It's all entertaining.  I just tell him Taylor, Tyler, and then he looks up. 
[03:33:30]  See, Taylor.  It's Tyler.  See, boom.  Tyler!  Good to see you again, buddy.  How are you?  Pretty good.  How are you?  I'm great.  Now, I saw you were holding your wet wipes a moment ago, and just looking at the console  in a very confused manner.  What was tough about this?  I would think that you take the wet wipes and you rub the table.  Now, it's just, it's truly dawning on me, like, when Sal was talking about wiping down  all the equipment and stuff, like all the little knickknacks and little corners that 
[03:34:00]  all this dust has gotten into, that's sort of what, it just sort of, like...  Well, I mean, you're almost done.  You literally have, like, seven minutes of work left.  It's not like you can, it's almost clean.  You can't look now and go, I can't believe this.  It's now dawning on me.  It's all in the garbage can.  It's all vacuumed up.  I can't imagine now if that side was covered with cereal.  Oh.  That would just, it would just have been...  It would be bad.  Plus, you've got to worry about getting Penn Jillette in here.  Did Penn Jillette say anything or his guy say anything when he walked in and the studio  was still... 
[03:34:30]  Penn goes, hello.  He goes, did you crawl out of a hole?  He goes, why are you so dusty?  Right, because you're dusty and then the studio is half filled with cereal still.  Yeah, he said, I go, oh, I go, is this your Halloween costume?  I'm like, no, I got thrown cereal at.  He goes, okay.  He knows the show.  Yeah, he knows.  That's why Penn Jillette is so great, because he goes, all right, that's to be expected.  Four, two, three, you're on after Oak and Anthony live.  Prime time.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, buddy?  We're just cleaning the studio, doing a little more vacuuming.  Hey, man, today's show was fucking awesome. 
[03:35:00]  I was laughing my ass off all day.  So, in the spirit of Halloween, man, I got something I want to do just for E-Rock.  Ah!  Oh, wait, wait, we have a gift for him, too.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You know what?  Since it's Halloween and that was a very good slobo, I'll send you a copy of The Conjuring  on Blu-ray.  All right, buddy, I'll talk to you later.  That's line three.  I hung up.  250.  I can't say you're... 
[03:35:30]  250.  Yeah, you're on the air, dude.  All right, now you can't be on the air.  Sal, have these guys done any housework whatsoever before?  Did you grow up doing housework or no?  Of course.  You did.  I actually did.  Tyler, I'm trying to tell these guys, we're in commercial break, you've got to fucking  hustle, and they're just doing this at such a slow pace.  I'm like, come on, we've got to do this.  Sorry, Sal, why is Denny out there lurking?  Oh, he probably heard free cereal.  He's probably going to eat some of the scraps that's on the floor.  Hey, Jack.  I could text some of my cousins. 
[03:36:00]  They could come clean this place.  Ask Denny why he's just leering out there.  Your father-in-law.  Yeah, it's our father-in-law.  Why is he leering?  What's he doing?  Jack, what's he doing out there?  Denny, what are you doing out there?  You're just leering like a creep?  You hoping there's some more...  Just looking.  Just looking.  You want some fruit brood?  No, you have any kashi cereal?  I like kashi.  We have fruit brood, dude.  I'm not into that stuff.  It's too sweet for me in the morning.  So you're just looking?  I was just looking at the studio to see what you guys did in here. 
[03:36:30]  Now, Sal, you were raised Italian family, traditional.  Obviously, everybody's got to do their part.  Yeah, I had a lot of shorts.  The black furniture.  What do you mean?  No, I'm kidding.  It's an awful guinea thing.  Plastic slipcovers?  Did your family have plastic slipcovers?  I wouldn't be surprised.  I was watching these guys, and you got this guy.  Look how slow he's going.  What's his name?  He's doing a good job.  Eric, Eric.  Tyler.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Tyler.  Tyler. 
[03:37:00]  You got Tyler over here.  Tyler, by the way, great to see you again, buddy.  You got Tyler, who's sitting here looking at wet wipes and looking at the table like,  I don't know.  I have no idea what I'm going to be doing here.  And then you have Jack, Yuri, Jack, who prefers to be called Jack, who's sitting there,  and I swear to God, while the show was on today, he's just staring at the vacuum cleaner.  Yeah.  He's like, well, how am I going to start?  Like, Dennis, you know when you use a vacuum cleaner, there's always some kind of pedal  on it somewhere so that you can angle it down so you can hold it like a person. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  He's sitting there popping wheelies with this vacuum cleaner.  It's going to do nothing.  All the brushes.  So he's just rolling the vacuum cleaner wheels on the ground, hoping, I guess, that some of  the cereal becomes airborne and gets sucked up.  When I was an intern, E-Rock smashed your TV.  I remember that.  And that was a tube TV.  Yeah.  And this studio was a fucking, not as crazy as this was, but that was more toxic shit.  Jack.  I cleaned that all up in minutes.  Come here for a second.  You ever use a vacuum cleaner before in your life?  Yep.  You have? 
[03:38:00]  Yep.  He's Russian.  All right.  He's Russian.  So then why are you popping wheelies with that vacuum cleaner?  You came in here.  Like, you know that the vacuuming happens on the floor of it.  You know what I mean?  On the flat part.  But instead of, like, all vacuum cleaners have some kind of pedal or something so you  can angle it down and hold it.  But you were just sitting there, like, holding it at an angle, thinking that the wheels were  just going to, I guess, sop up all the cereal?  I'm going to find the pedal at first.  So you were just like, I guess you just tilt it.  I don't know. 
[03:38:30]  Do you do a lot of housework?  Be honest.  Not as much.  Not so much.  Not in the past.  What's the past?  Two years ago.  Two years ago, you did housework.  For how long?  Once a month.  Okay.  So two years, you did monthly housework.  And what was the housework?  Vacuuming.  Now, these are tough questions, I'm assuming, because you're taking a real kind of pause.  I'm remembering.  Did you do a lot of housework?  Yes.  Okay.  How long ago did you do housework? 
[03:39:00]  Well, I was not living at home, so probably, like, two years ago.  Do you live by yourself now?  I clean my own apartment now.  Right.  So you clean it.  Yeah.  Where do you live?  At home, as well.  And so your mom just does it?  She's got it?  More so, yeah.  Or you got a cleaning lady?  We've got a cleaning lady.  And she's got it?  She's got it.  Okay.  So you're like, I don't need to figure out how to use that device that she's got.  So when you end up in, like, a real-world scenario like this, because, you know, when  you have a small studio and you have to clean up six boxes worth of cereal spread all  over the floor, I would call that a real-world scenario. 
[03:39:30]  Do you sit there going, I wish that I had spent more time with a vacuum cleaner?  Not always.  No.  You're just going, you know what?  I'm okay to have to suffer through it this time if it means I don't have to go home and  vacuum.  So how come two years ago you had to do some vacuuming?  We didn't have a cleaning lady before.  Would your parents come into some money?  I don't know.  Or would they just realize that, look, we can't count on Jack for more than once a month,  and even then, he's just rolling the vacuum cleaner wheels across the dirt.  There's literally nothing being sucked up. 
[03:40:00]  Mom, this vacuum's incredible.  I swear to God, I've been vacuuming for six months.  I've never had to empty the thing.  It's unbelievable.  That scenario might have happened.  It might have happened.  It might have happened.  And she's like, you're not doing anything with it.  There's no, it's not even plugged in right now.  Jack, do your parents call you Jack?  No.  No.  Call me Yuri.  Roland, this whole name change thing infuriates you.  It does.  Wait, wait, and when he was interviewing, didn't Iroch, didn't you say that he also wanted  to be called a different name then, too? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, he told me a different name when I interviewed him.  What was the name when you interviewed him?  Don.  Do you want to be called Don?  Yeah.  And how long ago was the interview?  July?  July.  So it's August, September, October, three months ago.  Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  He started in June.  No, this was May.  Okay, so six months ago.  Six months ago, you were going to go with Don.  And the vacuum goes.  Wow, you know, is that good radio?  That's great.  Okay, good, good, good.  We've got to make sure the studio is clean for Ron and Fez. 
[03:41:00]  Yes.  So Don was the name we were going to go with.  Were you going by Don for any amount of time, or did you just go into this interview and  think, I'm going to be interacting with new people at work now, I can choose whatever  identity I want.  Well, let me tell you, when I interviewed him, he told me he wanted to be Don, right?  Right.  Right.  His first day here, before I got a chance to introduce him to everybody, he already  went around and told everybody his name was Jack.  Well, I'm still trying to get through, I'm still trying to figure Don out right now.  So what was the decision to say, I'd like to be called Don? 
[03:41:30]  Was that something you were called, or was that something you figured you'd start fresh?  Start fresh.  So you figure, I'm going to start fresh, I'm going to create a new name for myself.  Did a personality go along with the name?  A little bit?  I wouldn't say so.  Maybe a little.  Because are Yuri and Don, are they the same guy?  At times, yeah.  But not always?  Not always.  Not always.  Because sometimes Don, how does Don differ from Yuri?  Don gets a preference order, right? 
[03:42:00]  Is that it?  Yuri fucks up.  Okay, so then, you're going to go by Don.  And it seems like it's okay.  You get to the internship, why do you start telling people your name is Jack?  I just like it more.  You prefer Jack to Don.  Have you ever gone by a different name than your birth name, Yuri?  Well, when I was younger, they used to call me Jack's Don thing.  They used to call you what?  Jack Skellington.  Okay, Jack Skellington, Nightmare Before Christmas.  Is that because you were skinny or because you had a big head? 
[03:42:30]  You have a big head?  Your head's not round, it's oval.  Jack Skellington's head is round.  So you were thinking, Jack, Jack Skellington.  So when they called you Jack Skellington, was that, did they call you Jack for short?  Or did they go, look, there's Jack Skellington, that little piece of shit, and start beating you up?  No.  It wasn't a mocking thing.  It wasn't a bullying thing.  Because this is no place for hate, you know that.  I don't know.  So, Jack Skellington was a name that they, was endearing. 
[03:43:00]  Dennis, we don't have to yell so much now, the vacuuming has stopped.  Yes.  It was an endearing name.  So you figured you could take Jack Skellington with him.  Were you hoping somebody here would be like, Jack, you ever see Jack Skellington from Nightmare Before Christmas?  That's what we should call you around here.  Or Jackass.  Yeah.  Anybody, anybody ever call you Jackass?  At times, yeah.  Yeah.  Did you ever think that maybe, there's no such thing as a Don-ass.  Yeah.  Maybe Don would be the way to go.  But Yeri's a scary name, though. 
[03:43:30]  I am Yeri.  What's wrong with Yeri?  It's awesome.  Nothing's wrong with it.  Why did you go against it?  I just...  You don't want to be called by your government?  Is that the problem?  Could be it, yeah.  It's a strong name.  Your mom gave you that name, though.  Not the government.  The Soviet government.  The Soviet government.  It's a good, strong name.  Like, what's your name?  That's true.  Do you like being Russian?  I like it, yeah.  So then why not have a nice, strong Russian name?  So, that's not the only thing I'm associated with.  You know?  Oh, it's that Russian kid. 
[03:44:00]  Gotcha.  You look a little Russian, to say the least.  Yeah, but then he's like, my name's Don.  You go, oh, I was wrong.  You must be Italian.  Donatello.  Donatello.  Right?  Who was Don?  Was that based on Donatello from the Ninja Turtles?  No.  I thought Dom DeLuise?  Because if so, that's Dom.  Don Corleone, maybe.  Was it Don Corleone?  No.  Who was the Don based on?  Don Wand.  By the way, if you listen real closely, they are vacuuming outside in the hallway right now. 
[03:44:30]  Who is Don based on?  Don Draper.  Yeah.  Okay, you just made that up because Eric said.  Yeah.  No, because...  Yeah, that sounds great.  He's handsome.  I know he's got a big dick.  My parents like the show.  They were watching it, so I'm like...  Mad medicine?  You're sitting there.  Well, my parents love Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, but I'm not a doctor.  What's her name?  Martha?  Or is that the MTV lady?  What was Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman's first name?  Denny, you should know that.  It was not Jane Alexander. 
[03:45:00]  What the heck was the character?  I don't know.  My parents love Gilligan's Island.  But you know what happened?  I showed up for my first day of my internship, and they were like, nobody here is going to  call you Ginger.  It doesn't make any sense.  And I said, all right, maybe I'll just go by Sam.  What about Marianne?  They said, no.  No.  Why not Yuri?  Little Buddy.  Why don't they just call you Little Buddy?  I just didn't want to be associated with, oh, that Russian kid.  Okay.  Russian kid.  How's it going so far?  Fine.  Now, what about when Roland doesn't let you be called Jack?  When he goes, hey, Yuri.  And I go, well, I think he likes to be called Jack.  And he goes, well, I'll call him Yuri. 
[03:45:30]  It's kind of annoying.  It bothers you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you'd like to set up your own identity.  Actually, my mother, Russia.  Do you, at home, what do your friends call you?  Jack?  No.  What do they call you?  My real name.  Yuri.  Yeah.  Okay.  So weird.  You think it's weird?  Somewhat.  Have you ever met any...  Yuri's a cool name.  I keep your name.  I mean, keep your identity.  That's who you are.  You ever meet anybody who just decided to change their name like that?  I had one in...  That's like what Asian kids do.  When I was in seventh grade, there was an Asian kid who came to class. 
[03:46:00]  It was his first day in class.  Nobody had ever seen this Asian kid before in our lives.  And we were like, what the fuck is this kid doing in our class?  And the teacher goes, is AC here?  And he goes, yes, that's my official name, but you can call me Paul.  And Yuri goes, what do you get Paul from AC?  I didn't...  Have you ever, Sal, heard of somebody just deciding this will be my name?  Like you said, with Asian people, yeah.  They just do it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, at least call yourself like AC. 
[03:46:30]  You could be like Anthony.  It starts with an A.  You just embrace it.  I have an annoying name and you just embrace it.  Salvatore.  Salvatore.  Yeah, what if Sal was like, I don't want to be known as Italian, so I just need you to  start calling me Mary from now on.  That's not really a guy's name, so...  Well, and we would call him that anyway.  Yeah, we've been calling him Mary from the time he got here.  You like to be called Sally?  Sally, no.  Sally Boy?  How about Sally Boy?  It's a Salvatore.  It's an Italian thing.  Hey, Sally Boy, come over here.  All right, maybe it's an Italian thing in like the 1950s. 
[03:47:00]  When you were, like, when your world, Dennis Falcone of radio, was still relevant.  When he was growing up.  Yeah.  When, like, when this world that you created was still great.  You loved the old school, huh?  Oh, yeah.  So you're a racist, right?  I'm not a racist.  Well, because that was a very racist time, was it not?  No, it's not.  Yeah, absolutely.  The 1950s were not a racist time.  It was a time of change in our country.  Okay, well, how else I know is...  Yeah, they had signs over water fountains.  You know what those signs referred to?  The ethnicities that were allowed to drink at them.  That sounds kind of racist. 
[03:47:30]  You didn't know that, did you?  No, I learned something every day listening to you.  The history lesson for Dennis.  You know, I'm surprised you guys didn't turn the cereal thing into a bit with Bobo.  He's not here.  Well, it might be a good bit with him, though.  Would you leave it?  Have him be covered with cereal.  Look.  And have little animals come and eat the cereal off him.  Dennis, this wasn't something we planned.  Somebody sent us a giant box of cereal and Roland was in the room, so he got stuck in the barrel.  The barrel?  Metaphorically speaking.  Oh, okay.  Eric, this is not what Yuri told you?  No.  I see you're holding your head. 
[03:48:00]  You're so frustrated with Dennis right now.  Okay, let's go with that, too.  When are you going to play some Halloween music?  I'm not playing any fucking Halloween music.  Now, our kids, they're not allowed to come to your house anymore, right?  Of course they are.  You're not on the list?  No, I was never on the list.  Okay, I didn't know for sure.  That's something I had to check.  That was a different DJ.  I have speakers in the window of my house.  He has a sign on his door that they're not allowed to come.  Yeah, I thought I read about you in the paper, though.  No, no, that's not me.  Something about an airport.  No.  That wasn't you.  No, that was not me.  Dennis, I apologize, and I stand corrected.  Thank you very much.  I gave him a whole music bed and sound effects bed. 
[03:48:30]  But I thought it was you.  No, you got that wrong.  Way wrong, young man.  I guess things are wrong sometimes.  Didn't you think that was Dennis, too?  I did.  I did.  We were wrong, though.  We were totally wrong.  Dennis is going to help.  Why is he tirating?  Because he's excited.  It's Halloween.  Oh, Eric always points it out.  Then he humps the console when he comes in here.  Well, you know, because I stand up all the time.  Did you dry hump the console?  No, I'm not doing that.  You're pelvic thrusting the console right now.  Don't do that.  All the time.  He's fucking the console.  All the time.  He's like, roughest excitement. 
[03:49:00]  I can't still.  Because that's what he's thinking.  That's what Dennis Falcone is sitting there, and all this corny and cheesy bullshit that  he does, in his mind, he's going, I'm going to take the skulls of the listeners right  now and fuck the shit out of them.  Sam, here's a list of the top 100 Halloween songs.  He's got Halloween music here.  Wait till you see.  I'm going to skull fuck the shit out of these Halloween-y acts.  He's making love to radio.  He is.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Skull fucking radio, Eric.  What's one Halloween song that isn't like a goth rock song?  Goth? 
[03:49:30]  Werewolf Bar Mitzvah, I think.  Werewolf Bar Mitzvah.  Creepy, crazy droid.  Now, Eric, what were you going to say about Yuri?  Slash Jack, slash Don.  The reason, when he told me he wanted to use a different name, and I said, okay, why?  He just kind of paused and looked away, and then he told me it was security issues.  Security issues?  And this is not, I'm not making this up, because I told, no, you told me it was security issues.  Is there an issue with the Russian secret police?  Could be.  But probably not?  You don't intern at a broadcast facility if you're worried about secrecy. 
[03:50:00]  Especially this show, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Does seem a little silly.  Don.  What other shows do your parents watch?  Revenge.  Who's a good character on Revenge?  I don't watch it.  They do.  You watch Mad Men, though?  Not really.  So how did you know his name was Don?  I saw a few episodes.  So what's the show that they watch that you watch a few episodes of?  Did they ever watch F-Truth or Hogan's Heroes?  Enough with Hogan's Heroes.  I don't even know what that is.  It's brick walls with this kid, Dennis, isn't it? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  He's a youngster.  Well, he doesn't know.  He's a youngster and a funster.  And a funster.  So, Dennis, it's Halloween today.  Halloween party here in the lobby today.  That's going to be fun.  It's not a Halloween party.  It's an October gathering.  Yeah, but it said come and enjoy Halloween.  Celebrate Halloween.  No, it didn't say celebrate.  It said enjoy Halloween treats.  Okay.  The word Halloween was in there, though.  Yeah.  I did notice it.  Do you feel like...  The whole gathering.  Do you feel like people are a little extreme with this anti-Halloween stuff, Dennis?  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  And even they did that, too, with Christmas music, too. 
[03:51:00]  But at least we have a Christmas channel.  We have many Christmas channels.  You love that Bill O'Reilly war on Christmas?  Christmas music.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  It's Christmas.  It's Christmas music.  December 25th.  It's Christmas music.  It's Christmas music.  It's not holiday music.  Yeah.  We should do a festive holiday.  Pete on Long Island.  How's it going, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  I'm back to the...  Well, I don't know if you want to go back.  Ridiculous name conversation.  Yeah.  My legal name's Fury.  I go by Pete.  What's your legal name?  P-I-E-R-R-I-E, which is important to note that that's Irish. 
[03:51:30]  It's not French.  Okay.  But you're an Irish dude.  Irish dude.  Piri.  Piri Francis Barnable IV.  Wow.  That's a great...  That's a fantastic name.  Why would you go by Pete from Long Island?  I would call up radio shows and be like, will you tell Sam that Piri Barnacle Irish name  IV is on the phone?  What was your name?  That's what I tried to go by.  I went by Pete all through high school and then they switched it up for my driver's license  and the teacher went down and was just like, Piri, and said my last name. 
[03:52:00]  Every person in the class looked at me and was like, what the fuck did he just do to your  name?  Tell me again.  I thought it was blown up.  Tell me the full name again.  Piri Francis Barnable IV.  Piri Francis Barnable IV?  Oh my God.  If I had that name, I would wear t-shirts with my name on it all the time.  I got to get some made up.  I definitely think you should.  And Piri Francis...  PFB.  Yeah.  PFB.  Exactly.  That's all it says on my fucking license. 
[03:52:30]  Piri Francis.  The whole name can't fit.  So it just says Piri F. Barnable.  And then Roman numeral IV.  Love it.  I love that dude.  Embrace it.  Embrace it.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  Have a good Halloween.  All right, buddy.  You too.  You see that, Yuri?  You got to embrace that shit.  Oh my God.  What are you doing over there, Dennis?  You're dancing.  Just dancing.  There's no music playing.  Just dancing, brancing, and romancing.  Just having a good time.  What the fuck's he talking about, Sal?  He's getting erect.  Are you erecting Dennis back up a little bit?  Yeah.  Radio.  Oh, shit.  There's a little something.  Why would you cut that out? 
[03:53:00]  You're a little chubby in the pants right now.  We don't have any candy corn in here, do we?  I think there's a little piece of candy corn pointing out of your pants right now, Dennis.  She's got a little bit of a boner.  I've got a little bit of honey.  A little bit of honey.  Yeah, there's a little honey going on.  That's what Dennis says before he eats an ass.  Eric in New York.  Yeah, I believe his parents, they watch a show called The Americans.  It's about Russian spies.  Is that what happens?  Is this whole Yuri thing, is this all fake?  Like, you watch The Americans, and you're like, yes, I will be Russian. 
[03:53:30]  Russian spy.  Are you even Russian?  Yeah.  I don't know if I believe you.  Does your mom run the kitchen and Orange is the New Black?  I don't think she does.  I don't think so.  He's familiar with the show.  Netflix show.  I was trying to tie in the read.  Well, when you talk about Orange is the New Black, I don't know what you're talking about  at Reed, but you talk about Orange is the New Black.  It's one of the great Netflix shows.  Let me tell you, speaking of Netflix, about Russell Peters.  He just happens to be one of the biggest stand-up comedians in the entire world.  And he's got a brand new comedy special, Notorious, premiering exclusively on Netflix. 
[03:54:00]  This hour-long special was shot on Russell's recent world tour, and it's the newest comedy  special for Netflix.  If you haven't already checked it out, you really have to.  It's awesome.  Notorious is not to be missed.  You saw it, Roland?  Yeah, it's Life from Australia.  It's really good.  Russell has been doing stand-up for over 20 years, since he was 19 years old.  This guy sells out arenas all over the world, has nearly a million Facebook fans, and his  YouTube videos have over 75 million hits.  Entertainment Weekly calls his new special, Notorious, funny, and risque. 
[03:54:30]  Netflix is also launching an exclusive four-part series, Russell Peters vs. the World, which  takes you behind the scenes during the Notorious tour.  So don't miss Notorious.  And Russell Peters vs. the World, now streaming only, only, only on Netflix.  Brent in D.C.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  I was wondering where Dennis sits when he comes in. 
[03:55:00]  Like, on the after show?  He sits, I don't know, one of the guest mics.  Oh, one of the guest mics.  If he's humping the console, I was wondering if maybe that's where the crusty shit they got  all over Opie's pants.  You're right.  Do you remember?  A couple of weeks ago, Opie was complaining that there was some crusty shit that was left  on his pants from when he was sitting at the console and his legs were touching the  bottom of the console.  Well, you know, Denny's here at all hours, even when we're long gone.  Do you think he comes in here after, like, when Ron and Fez are done? 
[03:55:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Not only do I think he comes in here, I think he comes in here.  Ew.  Is there a possibility that Denny's pre-cum was under this desk?  Yes.  I think so.  He's an ass eater.  He loves the ass, he tells me.  Where did Denny go?  What, I do a live read and he's got a vamoose?  No, he finished.  I want to know.  He finished.  I want to know if he has ever brought himself to completion under Opie's desk here.  Probably during the week he listed his holiday channel. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, I think so.  It's fucking weird.  It's fucking weird.  When he stands against that console, it's right at the bend.  Like, it's almost a triangle.  Yeah.  That's going straight into his crotch as he's thrusting towards the mic.  David in New York.  Oh my god, I'm on the radio.  Oh yeah, hell yeah.  I'm on the radio with Sam Roberts?  Fuck yes.  That was a good scream.  He really did scream like a girl.  You gave it a pin to let book.  Lord have mercy. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, you hung up.  You got all excited.  Mike in Baltimore.  Hey, what's up, Dick?  What's up, buddy?  Speaking of screaming faggots and cumming everywhere about the Guy Fieri thing.  Jesus Christ.  I know exactly what happened.  What?  The hairdresser queer was dicking Guy Fieri.  Okay, look.  It's like, you go to a certain extent, but just a dash of subtlety.  Like a dash.  Just some thing to tell me that you used your brain for a moment.  Not just like, fuck, cunt, shit, curse word, impressive, funny, right? 
[03:57:00]  Well, what's up, dicks?  Yeah, it's like, okay.  All right, I'm giving you that one.  It's going to be a bad call.  Let's see where you're going.  Tyler, you've used more.  When was the last time that you did some housework?  On my own house?  Are you a cleaning lady?  No, randomly in the street.  No, I worked a summer job cleaning schools.  You did?  Yeah.  You were a creepy janitor? 
[03:57:30]  Not exactly, no.  What's the difference?  Are you creepy?  No.  Tyler.  That's the difference.  Tyler.  We're trying to be honest here today.  It's Halloween.  It's Halloween, Tyler.  Also, it's hard to be creepy when there's no kids in the school.  No, not if you're just a naturally creepy dude.  Were you or were you not a creepy janitor in this school?  I was not.  Tyler.  Did you lick their seats?  Did you lick any seats?  No.  If you're not going to be honest with me, Tyler.  Also, that wasn't part of the job that I did.  Tyler, I can't have this conversation with you.  If you're not going to be honest with me from the get-go, it's not something we can talk about. 
[03:58:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm sorry.  But it's obvious to me.  If you were a janitor, you were a creepy janitor.  So, I'll go to 937.  He'll be honest with me.  937.  You're on the air, buddy.  What's up, buddy?  I am.  Yeah.  Can I get that Pendulet book?  Yeah, sure.  Hold on.  Thanks, man.  That's all it takes.  937 gets it.  You did it.  A signed copy, by the way.  It's the paperback version of Every Day is an Atheist Holiday by Pendulet. 
[03:58:30]  Make sure you check out his movie stuff.  What is it?  Fund Me Now?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Look up Pendulet.  Then he has a documentary out that is Oscar Buzz right now.  Oscar Buzz.  Oscar Buzz.  We'd love to see.  He can be an Oscar winner by the time he comes up here.  We'd love to see our buddy Pendulet win an Oscar.  He may be my favorite guest on the show.
