<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  It began with a discussion about their public image as "shock jocks" and the perceived pressure to be "nice" on the air, followed by a humorous anecdote about abandoning people in a London dumpster and a discussion about the unpleasantness of male-on-male kissing.

The show's football picks segment dominated a considerable portion, with Ant's abysmal performance (2 out of 7 correct picks) being relentlessly mocked.  Surprisingly, Sam, who guessed randomly, won the pool.  Jimmy, a comedian who appeared at Dennis Leary's Comics Come Home, was a guest and shared his experiences.  Movie reviews of "30 Days of Night," "American Gangster," "Lions for Lambs," and "Fred Claus" followed, with the latter two receiving negative commentary.

A heated debate ensued regarding "An Inconvenient Truth," with one host expressing newfound belief in global warming and the other remaining skeptical.  A caller, Mark from Ohio, vehemently disagreed, resulting in an angry confrontation and insults from Anthony.  Other segments included discussions about Veterans Day, the hosts' personal lives (including a drunken night and resulting hangover), and a listener contest for $1000.  A blind woman, Louise, was interviewed in a conversation peppered with awkward and insensitive questions about her sex life and perception of the world. The show also touched on Slash's autobiography and the $1000 listener contest, which involved a racially offensive soundbite as the cue to call.

A caller, Carol, initiated a contest segment, which transitioned into a discussion of the show's history and independence from K-Rock.  The news segment covered rising gas prices and the increasing, albeit small, adoption of hybrid vehicles, relating this to comedian Bill Burr's ownership of a hybrid. The hosts argued that initial hybrid cost savings often vanish over time.  The conversation then shifted to Prince Harry's girlfriend breaking up with him for missing her 22nd birthday due to the Rugby World Cup final.  This sparked a heated debate, including offensive language, about relationships.  A caller's sinus surgery experience was briefly discussed, followed by a news story about a recently released sex offender committing another assault, prompting outrage and discussions about mandatory sterilization.  Further news stories covered a dentist leaving a patient to die and another assaulting a patient.  The segment concluded with complaints about high cell phone bills and inexplicable charges from AT&T, such as a "towing" charge.

Another segment focused heavily on listener complaints about exorbitant and unexplained AT&T charges, with callers sharing shockingly high bills (including one of $3100 and another with $1200 in in-state roaming charges).  The hosts discussed hidden fees, "taxes on taxes," and the complexities of disputing these charges.  One caller mentioned an automatic towing service added to his Sprint bill, another the sale of phone insurance to children.  The conversation expanded to include general frustration with unclear contracts, using AT&T's lengthy (over 6700 words) contract as an example.  The hosts read excerpts highlighting confusing language and hidden fees. The segment also promoted upcoming Opie and Anthony events, including Adam Ferrara and Rob Bartlett's stand-up shows, and a "Fart Trivia" contest (censored on air).  The annual eggnog drinking contest featuring champion Pat Minaki and potential challenger Joey Chestnut was also discussed, along with a daily $1000 contest using a racially offensive soundbite.  Jim Norton's mother's voicemail, expressing concern over his lifestyle, was played.

A subsequent segment primarily focused on a new XM Radio fan website, XMRadioGold.com, and the eggnog drinking contest. The hosts discussed the site’s potential for negativity, referencing other online message boards. They contacted George Shea, president of IFOCE, about Joey Chestnut's potential participation and Pat Minaki's feeling of being overlooked.  Humorous exchanges about Pat's eggnog consumption (75 double shots) and a caller who'd already consumed 30 double shots were notable.  The later portion detailed Iraq's sleep study for suspected sleep apnea, leading to a graphic discussion about the procedure, the mask (compared to a pig's nose and Darth Vader's mask), and its impact on his sex life.  Several callers shared their experiences, and the segment ended with sexually explicit jokes. Guests included George Shea and Matt from Queensbury.

Another segment prominently featured a continuation of the sleep apnea discussion, with vulgar jokes about the masks and their effect on sex.  A heated discussion about a previous interaction between the hosts, Jim Norton, and Chris Jericho followed, playing an audio clip from BJ Shea's show detailing Jericho’s anger over a joke Norton made about paraplegics.  Both sides of the story were presented, featuring insults and accusations. A fire drill briefly interrupted the show.  A caller ("Flea's mom") complained about the show's offensive humor.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Jericho-Norton incident, a promotion for a Ron and Fez radio show segment, and the "Line of the Day" segment. Bronx Johnny also appeared, discussing a radio "war".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1, 2, 1, 2.  Po, po, boo, bo, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, fo, fo, fee, fi, mo, mo.  Po!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Oki and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one, to feel his manhand  holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst.  The worst showing.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Monday.  Monday.  Monday.  I don't know.  Who needs a reminder?  Monday.  I know the second that alarm goes off.  Hey.  It's Monday.  It's Monday.  Yeah, when the alarm went off this morning, it was one of those weird days where subconsciously  subconsciously I'm thinking, wow, what's that noise? 
[00:02:00]  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Monday.  Mondays.  You ever do that though?  You don't recognize your own alarm clock even though it's the same alarm clock you've  been used in the last two or three years?  What is this?  That's a weird noise.  Is that the fire alarm?  Eh.  Did I leave the TV on?  I have to set like four alarms now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got my regular alarm clock and then three on my iPhone that I just kind of pop on at 
[00:02:30]  five minute intervals just in case I fall asleep.  They just keep going off.  Yeah.  I'm usually up by the alarm clock one, but that's if, you know, I'm really beat.  A little safety backup.  Well, Ant, great football picks over the weekend.  Yeah, I kicked ass.  Made my football watching quite enjoyable.  Yeah.  Two for seven.  You're the two for seven kid. 
[00:03:00]  You and your stupid animals suck.  I was trying to, you know, logically reason it out which names of which teams would beat  another name of a team based on what they're named after.  And I had a little slump this week.  A little.  Last week you did four for seven.  So I'm thinking, all right, you can do my football picks again.  Two for seven.  And one of those games I had to tell you that a Viking cannot beat a Packer.  Yeah.  Or you lost that one too.  I basically said, dude, ugh. 
[00:03:30]  I basically was hinting Packers aren't losing that game.  There's no way in hell.  Well, that's when I came up with the Packers could throw the Vikings into their machinery,  their meatpacking machinery, and it got a lot of laughs.  Well, thank God, because that was one out of the two wins you had this week.  Well, what about the Giants?  I really thought the Giants were going to crush the Cowboys.  Gigantic people should be able to beat Cowboys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree with you there, but it didn't happen. 
[00:04:00]  It didn't.  I was very upset about that one.  So enough with your dumb idea.  We're done with you and your football.  Yeah.  I tried for a couple of weeks.  I'm just like, I stink at it.  Let's see.  You were 6'4", 14 in two weeks.  Nice.  Yeah.  All you had to do was pick home teams, and you could have done better than that.  Well, I tried a system.  It didn't work.  I'll have to come up with a new system.  I'm sitting there.  You know how you're watching.  Yeah.  You see the scores go by, and I'm just like, oh, God. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, this is just a catastrophe.  Loss after loss after loss.  Yeah, it was bad.  And then it's not fun to watch football anymore.  You ruined it for me.  No, it's a lot of fun watching me just tank.  And Sam, who knows nothing about football, by the way.  Yeah.  The big winner this week.  The big winner.  How did that happen?  He doesn't even know how many downs there are per team.  He's clueless, but he won the football picks.  By just guessing. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, he put nothing behind it.  At least I put something behind it.  The names of the teams.  Right.  Versus the other names.  Sam, congratulations.  Thank you.  Big week for football.  You have no idea who won, even.  Yeah, my picks.  All right.  Who won?  Giants lost.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who's the quarterback of the Giants?  I don't know who the quarterback of the Giants is.  Who was the star receiver for the Cowboys? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know the answer to that question either.  Who became the second quarterback to throw for, how much was it?  60,000 yards this weekend.  I think, was it Brett Favre?  I saw that in the email Travis sent out last night.  Oh, gosh.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Well, congratulations, Sam.  Thank you.  I don't know nothing about football, but you won this week's football pool, and you're  a little richer because of it, right?  Yes, I am.  Thank you, Dish Network.  It's time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  They supply the football picks, and my brother's going to have to come off the bench. 
[00:06:00]  It's going to go back to Alamo.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You picked the Giants or the Cowboys?  Yeah.  Which one?  He picked the Giants because they're giant.  Because they're giant.  Giant people squashing Cowboys.  I told you that was a bad pick, though, because Cowboys have...  I told you that.  Yeah, but...  Listen to me.  But how are Cowboys going to beat a Giant who could just step on them?  I don't know.  They did a good job on the Indians.  There's a lot more of them.  They have guns.  You know what?  My football picks go to Jimmy this week. 
[00:06:30]  Really?  Yeah.  He's showing a little knowledge right now.  Yeah.  A little bit of knowledge.  Yeah.  A little bit of that knowledge.  Everybody knew the 2-3 defense was never going to work against a pick-and-roll.  How was Boston, Jimmy?  It was really good, man.  Jimmy did Comics Come Home, Dennis Leary's thing he does every year.  Yeah.  For cancer.  6,000 people?  6,300.  Yeah, that was the capacity.  It was at Boston University.  This new venue they're doing it at.  And it was really good.  It was at Cam Neely Foundation. 
[00:07:00]  And it's weird, like, because Boston's such an aggressive place.  And I'm like, this is, you know, are they going to be rough?  Are they going to be great?  And in between jokes, they were just silent.  They were lovely.  Yeah.  They were lovely benefit people.  Oh, no yelling?  No.  One Marine was yelling Semper Fi to Dennis.  That was it.  It was great.  It was a good time?  Yeah, it was really good.  Very good.  All right.  And how was your weekend there?  Ah, great.  Nice drunken night on Friday. 
[00:07:30]  That was fun.  Went out to Iggy's, a little karaoke bar.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A little karaoke action?  I had a little bit of fun there.  And a little bit of Guinness and Jaeger.  Ah.  It's nice.  Spent Saturday pretty much just doing nothing, watching bad movies in bed.  Just trying to recoup.  Aren't you, uh...  I can't do that anymore.  But you're not old enough to be, like, spending all day in bed.  That's like an old person thing to do.  No, not after Friday night. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was really bad?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It was pretty, uh...  It was pretty bad.  Yeah.  No throwing up, which is good.  But I had quite the headbanger on Saturday.  And then Sunday, I went to the movies for the first time in a long time.  I actually went to a movie theater.  A movie theater.  That's not like you?  No, it's not.  But it was a good experience.  No problems.  And by problems, I think you know what I mean.  No problems. 
[00:08:30]  Saw that 30 Days a Night.  Uh-huh.  The vampire movie.  It was good, right?  Yeah, it was alright.  It was one of those...  It seemed more like a zombie movie than a vampire movie.  Uh-huh.  Because it's like, you know, you get a bunch of people.  Uh, they have to hide.  And, um...  Then they have a certain amount of time, and then they gotta get away.  That's pretty much it.  Group of people slowly getting picked off.  But it was...  It had a more zombie feel than a vampire feel.  Vampires were pretty creepy. 
[00:09:00]  Little kid vampires, always creepy.  Uh-huh.  But, um...  Some nice graphic violence.  You know, axing off some heads and stuff.  So that was pretty good.  Overall, uh...  Uh, two and a half to three.  Give it that.  Two and a half to three stars?  Yeah, yeah.  Out of what?  Ten stars?  On my...  Actually, a hundred stars.  Out of a hundred stars.  Do you follow the traditional five-star review?  Never.  No.  Never.  I change my star rating based on movies.  Sometimes the movies only got two stars to work with.  And I say, I give it two stars. 
[00:09:30]  And it's great.  Well, big surprise.  What's everyone thinking?  The big movie over the weekend was the B-Movie.  Yes.  Who saw that coming with all the advertising and marketing?  And Seinfeld's name on it.  Right.  I thought I was actually watching the B-Movie on regular TV over the weekend.  And just realized it was just commercial after commercial after commercial.  I think it's just called B-Movie.  I call it the B-Movie.  It's called the B-Movie.  Larry King called it that.  And Jerry got very angry. 
[00:10:00]  Well, that's why we're going there.  The B-Movie.  The B-Movie.  Beating out that gangster movie.  But the gangster movie was already two weeks in.  Yeah.  Very good movie.  I saw that.  Huh?  American Gangster.  You like it?  You like it?  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah.  Denzel was great.  Russell Crowe was great.  Ronnie said, because I heard his review.  He was saying, it was alright, but they could have left out more of the parts with the white  guy.  Because it was kind of cool just to have the black gangster thing going on.  And then they were throwing too much of the cop thing and his family life and all that 
[00:10:30]  crap.  Yeah, they did throw in a little too much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was still enjoyable.  Yeah.  I like Denzel was great.  And one of the guys from The Wire was in it.  Oh.  I'll just say there's one scene in it that's really good where, let's just say one of the  gangsters in front of a whole group of people puts the gun against the other gangster's  head.  He goes, what are you going to do?  Shoot me in front of all these people?  Really well done.  Nice.  You have to be able to watch somebody collapse on a sidewalk in front of a bunch of witnesses. 
[00:11:00]  Very, very cool.  And then, of course, we've got Veterans Day today.  Yes.  So, big hello to all the veterans out there listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Actually, they're not listening.  They're sleeping.  No, they're listening.  Right now, you think?  They're always on guard.  Always on duty.  Oh, no, that's the Canadians.  You were right, by the way, I think, about that stupid Tom Cruise movie.  Because we saw Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise all on Good Morning America together.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, that must not be good.  They knew.  It was really hard.  And what did it make, $300 at the box office? 
[00:11:30]  They knew it was just a lemon.  Yeah, you can tell when a movie's going to suck.  Lions for Lambs, right?  Or something like that.  What's the name of the movie, even?  Yeah, no one even knows.  It got 26% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  What, Lions for Lambs?  Lions for Lambs.  Yeah, the B-movie actually got 51% good reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Brother Wee's back in the day turned me on to this website.  It's the only place to go for movie reviews.  Because they take all the movie reviews from all the major newspapers across America and give you one solid review. 
[00:12:00]  Like American Gangster, for example, 79% good review on RottenTomatoes.com.  And, oh, wow.  Dan in real life is doing that well.  64% good reviews.  And which one did you see, Ed?  30 Days of Night.  30 Days of Night.  51% good reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Oh, okay.  Saw 4 getting 17%.  Yikes.  Yeah, that Saw franchise is strictly for, I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  Horror buffs.  No, you go on, like, cable.  Or you see it in a hotel when it's on there or something.  You think?  Yeah.  And then Fred Claus.  Oh, God.  Does one of these crap movies have to come out every Christmas?  That's the slapstick, wacky Christmas movie.  You have to do it every year.  And especially since Bad Santa, now it's got to be, like, the twisted Christmas movie every year.  This year it's Fred Claus.  Fred Claus. 
[00:13:00]  Fred Claus, 23% good reviews.  Looks funny, though.  Thus far.  Vince Vaughn, he's always entertaining.  And then I, over the weekend, also watched An Inconvenient Truth.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, I saw that, because, you know.  Oh, no, here we go.  Hubbub and hullabaloo about it.  Here we go, go ahead.  I completely believe in global warming now, and we have to do something about this, because we're doomed as a world.  And that is based on me watching that movie. 
[00:13:30]  No!  That's so stupid.  He, uh...  Why, why, why, why?  Oh, you really thought...  It's my acting chops, Jimmy.  Very good.  My acting chops.  Do you believe there's something going on, at least?  Yeah, I think there's something going on.  And I think, you know, when you have facts like he had, they took, you know, a bunch of core samples from the North Pole, and they were able to dig down far enough where they could actually get air that was on the Earth or over the Earth from thousands of years ago. 
[00:14:00]  So they could test it for, um, carbon levels and whatnot.  And, uh, it was a lot less back then than it is now.  And in recent years, like just about the 1900s and when we started our industrial era and stuff like that, it really shot up.  Like, ridiculous.  They showed the graph line, and it just ridiculously shoots up.  Eh.  So what?  Like, who cares? 
[00:14:30]  What difference does it make?  A lot of people out there care.  Ah.  A lot of people.  When they, when he started showing, uh, and then it contradicts itself.  Is it getting cold or is it getting hot?  Well, it's kind of cold.  No one knows.  Like, he's talking about a second ice age coming if we don't watch out, and then he's talking about things burning up.  But doesn't a second, doesn't the ice age take a really long time, though?  No.  Ten years, Europe can be frozen if, if, uh, uh, the, the polar ice caps melt. 
[00:15:00]  No.  And screw up with the conveyor system, which is the, uh, yes, the currents in the ocean.  No.  You know, warm water on top, cold water on the bottom.  Sure.  Bunch of cold water comes in, it screws up the flow.  All of a sudden, this engine that's kind of turning in the North Atlantic and, and getting warm air, pushing it over Europe, will stop turning.  And, uh, all of a sudden, Europe, frozen.  Just frozen Europe.  Ice age.  Just the water part?  No, the whole, land and everything.  Crazy. 
[00:15:30]  Wow.  How do you get stock in ice skates?  Uh, yeah.  European ice skates.  I will sell them for 50 euros.  But don't the Europeans have weird ice skates?  Don't they have like, like, like, I don't know, like, like curly toes on them or something?  Yes, very curly, Hans Christian Andersen-like, um, ice skates.  All right, where do I get that company?  I need stock in that company.  Bye, bye.  It's, uh, it was done very well.  Uh, Al Gore seems like a nice, sincere, likable guy. 
[00:16:00]  I, I really don't have any problems with him.  Uh, it showed part of his background and upbringing and stuff as a little farming family.  And, and it was done very slick, very well.  He did these presentations with huge screens behind him at colleges and, um, environmentalist meetings and stuff.  So it was done very well.  Right.  I could understand how it got so much attention.  He added some humor to it.  Uh, which, you know, you don't think of humor when you think of Al Gore.  But it was kind of, uh, there was some funny parts.  But, um, did he, you know, he's taking it very seriously. 
[00:16:30]  Did they explain why he got so fat or how he got so fat?  No, actually, uh, they did not explain that.  I think it's called not having to run for office and look, uh, presidential.  I think it's called supporting the fast food industry.  You think he's doing that?  Of course.  And then when he's on tour, I guess, doing all this stuff, uh, the, the speaking engagements, uh, you know,  he'd eat like crap on the road.  So it's probably what he's doing.  Free meals on the arm for the rest of his life.  You kidding me?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  He'd eat whatever he wants.  Yeah.  Whatever he wants.  How nice that's going to be.  Crap.  But then they did.  They showed him on planes and stuff, doing a lot of stuff.  Those, those things I think kick out a lot of exhaust, if you ask me.  They're burning up a lot of fuel.  I'll tell you one thing.  Here in New York, uh, I personally breathe a sigh of relief because, uh, it's cold.  Yeah.  We were all kind of looking at each other, like, late October, early November.  Eh, it's still, it's still pushing 80 every day.  What's this about?  It's supposed to be colder and, um, it's got colder later.  See, this is still, he would say it's still the effects. 
[00:17:30]  And by the way, um, Manhattan will be underwater in, um, about 50 years.  50?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or at least a lot of it.  No.  Florida's gone.  Uh, that, just forget about it.  Uh, right up there till, till Lake Okeechobee.  It will just be gone.  Yeah, but when, when is it supposed to have, like, you know, start eroding drastically?  Uh, I, I, I think it'll start going faster and faster.  See, you know what happens?  The ice caps are melting, Opie. 
[00:18:00]  The ice caps.  And Greenland is melting, by the way.  Greenland's just melting.  And when that happens, uh, the sun reflects off of the ice.  Reflects.  So that heat from the sun reflects off the ice and it's absorbed by water.  So the heat gets absorbed by water.  The more, uh, uh, or the less ice there is, because the ice is melting, the less sun's  reflected.  Makes more water, more heat's absorbed.  So it kind of, you know, builds up ahead of steam as time goes by. 
[00:18:30]  So, uh, I'd say by the day after, uh, tomorrow, we're pretty much, uh, done.  No, because I go to Florida, you know, ever since I was a kid and, uh, in the last, let's  just call it, let's just call it the last 20 some odd years, a little over 20 years,  go to the same beaches.  I don't, I don't see much of a difference.  No.  What you do see a difference in is, uh, a snowfall, things like that.  You don't see as much snowfall.  Uh, and then they show always shown pictures of glaciers.  It's like, this is a glacier from 1908 and here it is today. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Not much glacier pulled back.  What do you want from me?  Not much different.  No, it's big difference.  Oh, great.  Big difference.  Huge glacier gone.  Then they show, uh, mountains, you know, snow cap mountains.  And, uh, then they show them now that is no snow.  Well, maybe they didn't feel like having snow in their mountains anymore.  We're, we're, maybe they wanted plant life.  One lifetime is a very insignificant amount of time on this planet.  And if weird little fluctuations happen in a lifetime or generation, uh, I don't put much 
[00:19:30]  credence in the fact that it's the end of the world.  You give 10 generations and you start seeing some problems.  All right.  Now you're talking a little flick in time instead of a little speck.  People are so self-important.  Like Al Gore.  He's self-important.  Everyone likes to think Armageddon is right around the corner in your lifetime.  It ain't.  Ow.  Ow.  You're going to be laying in a hole somewhere, rotting away as people play on top of you. 
[00:20:00]  It's just going to happen.  And, and, and if, if this global warming thing does catch up with somebody, it's going to  be a little further off than I think everybody, uh, figures.  Let's talk to Mark in Ohio.  Mark, what's up?  Uh-oh.  We're talking about the end of the world, Mark.  Oh my God.  All right, Mark.  What do you want?  What do you want, Mark?  Tell me what you want.  I don't want Professor Anthony anymore. 
[00:20:30]  What do you want?  Anything but Professor Anthony.  What do you frigging want then instead of just me discussing something for a few minutes?  I just want to entertain me.  By what?  Give me a frigging, give me an example of what you want, douche.  Go ahead.  What do you want?  You don't have to be.  You want a dick joke?  Huh?  You want a dick joke?  Will that, will that do it for you?  Uh, Jesus Christ, go bury your head.  Go shoot yourself.  Jump off a frigging bridge, you douche. 
[00:21:00]  Just leave.  In that order.  Go.  Fuck you.  God, I'm sick of these ass.  Ugh.  Enough of him.  Christ on a pony.  Gee, gee, okay, forget it.  Ugh.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  We got nothing but...  What do you want?  What do you want?  Ah, dick jokes.  We'll do some dick jokes after the break.  It's fine.  Ugh.  The bar?  Yeah.  Yes.  God. 
[00:21:30]  Good.  Stan's holding up the break sign.  Good break.  We'll make Mark happy.  Well, Mark doesn't understand.  If you listen to this program at all, Anthony doesn't believe in any of this crap, so he  finally sees inconvenient truth.  It's kind of interesting to a lot of faithful listeners out there.  Like, wow, the guy finally saw the movie.  What does he think?  Because it affected a lot of people out there.  Yeah.  A lot of people went green because of that movie.  Oh, don't talk about it.  No more.  Oh, ho, ho.  We don't want to put him to sleep.  Douche. 
[00:22:00]  I wish Ant would become a flaming liberal environmentalist.  That would be good.  That would be really good.  Epiphany?  Wouldn't I?  You know, a thing with an E?  Epiphany?  Something E.  He gets so into the movement that he officially wants the show to go green, and we can't broadcast.  Yeah, we have to go green.  We can't broadcast anymore because it uses electricity.  I ride a little scooter into work.  You have to do an Ed Begley Jr.  Ed Begley Jr. on a bicycle.  Just ride your bike to work every day.  Ew, does he ride his bike?  Oh, yeah.  Of course he does.  To where? 
[00:22:30]  I love how they say Ed Begley Jr. rides his bike to work every day.  What's he doing?  He doesn't work.  Why doesn't Ed Begley...  To his mailbox and back.  No scripts.  Hey, I think this guy...  Let's go to Seth in New York.  Seth?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  By the way, to Mark out there, because I'm sure he's still listening, the phones are completely  lit because people do want to hear this crap.  Oh, I hate Mark.  Seth, go ahead.  This Mark would die right now.  You're absolutely right.  We do want to hear it.  But what I think personally is that the seasons are eventually going to change. 
[00:23:00]  You know, winter's going to get longer.  Summer's going to stay later.  Winter's going to be summer.  Summer's going to be winter.  Yeah, I think what's going on is the rotation of the earth is happening in such a way that  it's just kind of reversing itself.  So you know how, like, what?  Australia has...  Where are they right now?  In spring?  They're heading towards spring?  They're heading towards summer, really.  Summer?  Okay.  So we're going to be, like, eventually heading towards summer this time of year.  The earth is...  The earth is slowly rotating. 
[00:23:30]  As it spins.  Filting on its axis?  It spins like this.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  But as it does that, it's also like...  No one's noticed?  Slightly.  No, not yet.  Oh.  It's happening very, very slowly.  I agree with that guy.  The seasons are just going to change.  All right.  Because the woo, woo, woo, woo, woo also has...  Just a little bit.  A little...  It might take about...  But I'm going to say two more generations of this.  That's it? 
[00:24:00]  As woo, woo, woo, woo, woo continues.  And then it's going to tilt on its axis.  Okay.  Yeah, it's slowly just tilted.  That's scary.  And you've got the two axes.  Axises.  So they're just going to change places.  And then eventually...  Wait, then it's going to be upside down relative to what it is now?  Yeah, that's what I mean by that.  Oh, upside down.  And woo, woo, woo.  And then we'll just go back to woo, woo, woo for a few, like, I don't know.  That's creepy.  A few hundred years.  And then the process will start again.  We'll spin back around.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, it's Pod Talk Monday, everybody. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, it is.  And when we get back, we've got to stay on this subject because there's a great, great  news piece out this morning.  Hybrids could take 17 years for a consumer to make back extra costs.  Go ahead.  People like Steve and Bill Burr can get their hybrid car.  And we can explain that.  It's just, you know, they're taking advantage of the people that are starting.  They're trying to do the right thing.  It's also, what?  We got free Ringtone Monday Mania.  Oh. 
[00:25:00]  Might give you a few ringtones today.  It's also Feel Good Story Monday.  We got that right in front of me.  The Feel Good Story of the day is right, right here.  And also, we're going to give away $1,000.  What's the sound?  Do we remember?  Yeah.  You had it.  It was me, right?  Yeah.  Which one?  It was that fun one.  Oh, it was that one?  It was fun.  I heard it on a promo over the weekend and I was laughing.  All right.  Sometime between 7 and 7.30, we're going to play this.  Yeah.  And when you hear that, be the 10th caller. 
[00:25:30]  877-212-ONA.  And you will win $1,000 from your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show  On a Monday  Yeah  What's up veterans  My pop was a veteran  I'm with ya  I'm with ya  I miss my dad's friends 
[00:26:00]  I gotta go see them  The old codgers  You're with them in spirit  What?  Not, you know, you aren't a veteran yourself  Oh no, no  I'm with ya  I think the only reason  There's no veterans or  Yeah, no one that was in the military  In our world  In our radio  Like our  Microcosm  Our circle here is because we were born  In a lucky time  In between wars and stuff  What's up vets 
[00:26:30]  I gotta go to Kings Park  And check out the boys at the VA  Ah yes  Not the VA hospital  The veteran  What are they called  BFW  BFW, that's what I was about to say  Sit around and have a few beers  And listen to them make fun of every single race  Amazing  Like real men do  Oh yeah  Oh they'll make black jokes right in front of the black vets  I've said this many, many times  Well I guess they've been through stuff that's a little more serious 
[00:27:00]  Than just a couple of jokes  The Italians make fun of the Irish there  The Irish make fun of the Italians  The Polish guys, the bartender  And they all make fun of him  Because he's stupid  It's amazing  What goes on at the VFW halls  Freedom of speech I say  Of course  And they exercise it thoroughly  In those places  By the way  I was catching up on Curb Your Enthusiasm  Over the weekend  Love, love, love that show 
[00:27:30]  Yeah  We don't talk enough about it  They did a whole show  Where Larry said the N-word  About four or five times  Really?  And I was just like  Wow  What balls  What balls  You get a lot of balls  And you got that Seinfeld money  Just look at Kramer  Now if we say it right now  They'll dump out of it  Yeah  Even though we're trying to do  An entertaining  You know  Program for everybody  Yeah  Why not?  Why if  If we came up with a way to say it  Why couldn't we just say it on the radio? 
[00:28:00]  Because we'd mean it  People get very offended  Words hurt  Or we're looked at differently  It just came up again  Because we've discussed this many times on our show  That you're just looked at differently  If you do a radio show  Where the main focus of the radio show  Is to entertain  And make people laugh  But if all of a sudden  You know  One of our jokes goes wrong  Or we say the wrong word  We're fired  Yeah  Why isn't Larry David fired  For having a whole episode  Where it kind of revolved around the N-word 
[00:28:30]  Why does South Park continue to do what they do  Without any real problems?  That's a good question  So effed up  I have no idea  When is that going to change?  Never ever  I'm thinking maybe we could start our show every day  With some massive disclaimer  Just a massive  This is what we do  How come for some reason  Disclaimers don't work in radio?  That's what I'm saying  It is so effed up to me  That entertainment in general  You can get away with stuff  If you're doing a TV show  If you're doing a movie  If you're doing a cartoon 
[00:29:00]  The following program contains graphic language  You know  That like all of a sudden  You're freed up to say a few things  That might be off color  I think we're in our own genre  I really do  You explained in an article recently  Like when you do a talk show  You're in the news talk genre  So you have to have a little more responsibility  Yeah there's gotta be this  You gotta be like a newscaster  And have that type of ethics  Doesn't wash with me 
[00:29:30]  Can't just be entertainment  What about the old days  When they used to put on radio shows  And you'd have a script  And read it  Those people weren't held accountable  For what they said  Because they were playing characters  Yeah  Maybe if we did characters  Like Mr. Amos  Right  Oops  No even if we do that in character  Yeah I know  We'd be screwed  We're screwed  I was just thinking about it over the weekend  It's just so weird  I think we're in a very very small group of radio shows  A tiny little group of radio shows  That doesn't really  We don't fit in any categories 
[00:30:00]  We don't fit in the news talk category obviously  Although we do show our intelligence every once in a while  And we'll talk about news  And things that are going on in the world  You know  Yeah  And get zzzz  Zzzz from the emails  And then  What is the other category in radio really  Wacky morning shows  That are so stupid and silly  We're not in that genre  And even they can't say anything  And then the rest of them  Are just playing music  And doing like top ten lists  Yeah  And the Q with the D  We're a sexy show I think  Yeah we're sexy 
[00:30:30]  Rawr  Rawr  I was telling these guys during the break  Maybe  Maybe  Wackbag or one of the fan sites  Could help us out  Everyone's doing their  We're going green  Thing  These days  Yeah  I was watching Biggest Loser recently  And they had to have their  Their green episode  Where everything was revolved around  You know  Green  Recycling  Green is a very big catch word right now  And turning off the electricity  And just eating organic food  And I was telling Anthony  We have to do our official green show 
[00:31:00]  Whatever that means  We don't know what that means yet  See we like to do this in front of everybody  Like this is an idea  Hash it out  We just don't know  How we're going to make it our own yet  We have to give it the Opie and Anthony spin  Obviously  And it would be pretty silly to do our green show  As we talk through  You know  These things that are giving us all brain cancer  Microphones  And a lot of power coming out of the transmitter  Of this thing  You know  It takes a lot of juice to keep these things going  But I'm thinking we could do our own green show  I should turn my lights off more 
[00:31:30]  That's what I could do  I could turn my lights in my house off a lot more  Yeah  I have  I have giant floodlights  That come on  And just make the outside of my house glow  Like it is  It is made of light  Right  Why?  Because I want it to look palatial  Yeah  It's just  They're just floodlights  That shine on my house  And I drive up  Like last night  I'm coming back from the movies  And they're on a timer 
[00:32:00]  You know  So I make the corner  And I go  Wow  That is really lit up  No reason whatsoever  All the other houses  Dark  Mine's got to be lit up  Like it's  Like the alarm just went off  At a POW camp  Oh my god  You know  I'm going to  I'm going to  I'm going to turn down the heat  And close my windows  My thing is to keep my windows open  And keep the heat on  So I get some fresh air coming in  I don't like the heat in the bedroom  I like that turned off 
[00:32:30]  Because I like the bedroom being cold  Because in the middle of the night  With the blankets and stuff  You can kind of regulate your temperature  But I'm  The lights  I have a problem turning lights off  Like I'll go to bed  And then  Shut the light off  In the bedroom  And look and go  Oh boy  I just see a glow  Coming from downstairs  I know I forgot to turn the light off  Do I get up and turn it off?  No!  I'll just let it burn  Burn baby burn  That doesn't use a lot of  Electricity anyway  It does all the time 
[00:33:00]  Nah  Big floods in the ceiling  Let's go to Robin  Horrible  I'm a waste  Are you scared of the dark?  I'm not scared of the dark  You are though  I prefer a little bit of light  Why?  Because I like to see my surroundings  That's a yes by the way  Of course  No no no  I'm not afraid of the dark  Per se  It's not like this  I sit in fear  I like having  If it's dark  I'm not going to freak out  I'll go to sleep  But I prefer to have  A tad bit 
[00:33:30]  Like a TV type light  On  Or something like that  I like it pitch black  Or a distant light  Pitch black when I sleep  How do you sleep with a TV on?  You've been talking about this for years  Well the sounds of it  A lot of times I'll put a music channel on  And let that play  But there's a little light from the TV  I like that  If I hear a little sound  I don't want to be creaking my neck  Wondering what the hell it is  In the darkness  Know what the problem is  With those trippy stations  They got a few on XM  They got a few on regular radio  They got a few on the TV choices 
[00:34:00]  Right?  Yeah  And you'll get into a nice groove  It's real mellow  Almost like massage music  And you hear the water  And the nice piano  And very light guitar  And all of a sudden  This is how they wreck it  You're listening to the sounds of the season  Ugh  Right in the middle of it  They just will have to make their stupid announcement  What you're listening to  And it takes you right out of that dumb  Whatever trance you were in  By listening to this music  And I'll just put it on a rock station or something  And like turn it really low 
[00:34:30]  But go to sleep to that  Oh alright  So  And it's off the TV  So there's no DJs  It just plays consistently  Let's go to Rob in New York  Rob what's up?  Hey how you doing guys?  Hey  I love this show  I've just had an epiphany myself  As I'm driving to work  We have atom smashes  We have satellites in space  That could watch you pick your nose  And we're now at the apex  Because we've reached  Woo woo woo  Hee hee hee hee  Right  Exclamation of the 
[00:35:00]  Look man  Rotation and  First of all  It's pot talk Monday  But I'm trying to explain  Why the seasons are slowly changing  And it's because we're still doing  The woo woo woo  As an earth  But there's also a  Eee  As the earth itself  Is slowly turning  Up and down  Flipping  Right  Oh I know  I gave up on  The Discovery Channel  I understand that  It's a little weird out there  But I don't want to know  How weird  That's how I 
[00:35:30]  That's how I roll  Thank you sir  I'm one of the few  Veterans that's got a report  To work right now  I'm at Randall's Island  So guys have a great show  I enjoy the show  You guys are the best  To keep my mornings going  Oh thank you sir  Gotta work for it  It's his day  Have a good day guys  Alright  Hey can we play  Drew Boogie  Steve's Hybrid Remix  This is very very cool  Then we'll get into  That hybrid story  We teased before the break  Hit it there  E-Rock  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break 
[00:36:00]  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  We teased before the break  I love you. 
[00:36:30]  All right, we get the idea.  Thank you, Drew Boogie.  Really fast, we got Louise on the line here.  Louise, what's up?  Right, I'd like to know the phone number I'm supposed to call after I hear this morning's sound. 
[00:37:00]  Ah.  All right, you got a pen down?  I'm visually impaired, but I use a slightness when I get off the phone.  All right, then I'll have that happen, darling.  I never had eyesight.  I was born without it.  Oh, would you rather have been born without it or have it and lose it?  Oh, I'd rather have been born without it because I don't know what it's like anyway, so.  That is so weird.  I hate these conversations.  Wait, are you visually impaired or totally blind?  Totally blind, that's what I mean. 
[00:37:30]  What do you see?  Big difference.  Do you see just like blackness, nothing?  No, I don't even see nothing.  But she doesn't know what seeing is.  Nothing is black.  Do you even understand the concept of seeing?  No.  Do you see something?  Do you see stuff in your dreams?  I see in my imagination, yeah.  Boy, things must look really screwy.  Oh, how cool would that be?  It's like a sci-fi movie.  I just picture everything all goopy and not really together, running.  But even if I don't see, I go out and do for myself as if I never lost. 
[00:38:00]  God love you, dear.  How do you picture things like when someone says the color red or hair is blonde, what  does your mind do?  Well, if I hear red, it reminds me of, you know, like red if you hurt yourself and you  turn red, you know what I mean?  Oh, okay.  It's more of an emotional thing.  How do the people around you explain black people?  They punch you in the face.  Oh, God.  No, I never really got into that conversation. 
[00:38:30]  I would like the phone number.  Yeah, we know.  We're interviewing you.  Would you, um, wait, what are your ears okay?  Yeah, pushy boy.  Do you, uh, do you think you have a good understanding of what people look like based on, you know,  the years of just kind of touching and...  No.  You really don't think you have a good idea, a good line on it?  No.  Do you make mental pictures in your head?  I make kind of, you know, like, uh, if I feel different materials, I think of it as 
[00:39:00]  like different flavors, you know, like vanilla and chocolate, you know.  Wow, you really got to pull some plugs and reroute things, huh?  Yep.  Jesus.  So you, you, you feel material, but then you got to kind of equate it to things that  you know, like taste and smell and things like that.  Right.  Boy, that is weird.  Yeah.  And you want the number so you can know when.  Oh, yeah.  I would like to use that money right now.  Ah, what could you use a grant for?  Well, I'm going on a, on a trip to, um, Rochester and... 
[00:39:30]  Why?  ...and I bought a ticket and it's expensive.  I'm seeing some friends and I want...  No, you're not.  You're not seeing anybody.  Well, I call it a seeing, you know, like I'm visiting.  Well, what is...  All right, you're visiting friends.  Why doesn't your family just turn you around in a circle for an hour and then go, here you  are, you're in Rochester, enjoy.  And then just get on the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, why, why go anywhere?  Oh, I, I go out, it doesn't matter, blind and no blind.  Yeah, but, but why? 
[00:40:00]  You can't really see anything.  You know, you don't want to say anything.  Even if you have eyesight, you realize, uh, that going from city to city, why bother?  Yeah, why bother?  Because it's the same crap.  When we were growing up, it used to be cool to go, uh, to different cities because you  saw actually different things.  You got to eat at different type of restaurants.  Now it's one, the same strip malls in every city.  They ought to take her, like, instead of taking her to a place, just sit you on the porch  and then go vroom with a fan in her face and go, vroom, ooh, yeah.  We got the top down. 
[00:40:30]  I'd rather go out and do things like anyone else.  Yeah, well.  Well.  Fortunately.  Yep.  A little windows to the world or a little dirty.  That's okay.  I, I, you know, the world is, the world is, you know.  All right, good.  It's, it's darkness and nothingness, I understand.  So, are you married?  Nope, I'm single.  Single?  How old a gal are you?  I'm 56.  56?  Did you ever have a date?  Well, I do have, I, I do go out with different guys. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah?  Yep.  Do you give it up?  Nope.  No, what do you mean, no?  Have you ever?  No.  You've never had sex?  No.  You ever ridden a horse with an elephant man face guy?  No.  Why haven't you had sex?  I don't, I don't want to have it because there's too many diseases going around.  Doesn't matter, you have to be able to see yourself falling apart.  Why don't you just enjoy yourself now?  Go out and get laid, you're 56.  Blind stalker patty.  No, I just want to stay a virgin the rest of my life. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  Why?  Are you, do you like guys or girls?  I like, I like, I like anybody, really.  You should try it.  You might, you might catch one in the eye and all of a sudden I can see.  Uh oh.  Is there any hope that you'll ever see?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know what the technology is all about.  Are you a big girl, are you?  No, I asked that question.  Am I what?  Are you a heavy girl?  Size 14.  Oh, I love to eat.  I'm about 300 pounds.  Wow.  Are you lying or no?  Huh?  Are you lying or no?  Yeah, down right now.  She can't get up. 
[00:42:00]  No, I'm not lying down.  I'm sitting right on a chair.  Are you really 300 pounds?  Huh?  Are you kidding or are you serious?  I'm not, I'm kidding.  I'm not kidding.  300 pounds, so you eat a lot.  Everything that won't get up and walk.  You ought to watch what you eat.  Uh oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you know you're not eating like rotting food or poisonous food?  That's just like having sex.  I have a sense of smell.  If it doesn't smell good, I don't eat it.  Well, you should use that same advice.  No wonder she doesn't have sex.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  You should use that same logic when it comes to dating.  All right.  Well.  All right.  That's about that.  Oh, you're fine.  All right.  Here's the number for the contest starting at seven o'clock.  Right.  You lost it.  No, I got it right here.  We have it.  Okay.  1-800.  1-800.  N.  You mean the number six on the phone. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, but I thought I'd do it easy for you.  N.  Yeah.  O.  O.  E.  E as in everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is what you eat.  Y.  Yeah.  N-O-E-Y.  E.  E.  S.  S.  S.  S.  S as in some.  Leave the last S off for C.  All right.  Why don't you read the phone number back to me, please? 
[00:43:30]  You know, I can't understand it.  All right.  You know, like when it's letters, I got to hear it in numbers.  1-800.  Yeah.  1-800.  And.  Yeah.  How do you, how do you, how do you, how do you, how do you just memorize the number if  you hear it real quick?  Is your memory that good?  Um, yep.  All right.  1-800.  Yeah.  How do you do that?  How do you do this?  Letter.  Wait, how do you do?  Uh, 1-800.

[00:44:30]  C.  A.  A.  N.  N.  T.  T.  S.  S.  E.  E.  E.  E.  Right.  Those are the two numbers you could use to win the contest.  Oh, either one of them.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, N-O-E.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Yep.  Y.  Yes.  S.  Right? 
[00:45:00]  I forgot an E.  E.  What, excuse me?  You forgot an E after the Y.  N-O-N-E-Y-E-S.  Right?  Yes.  S.  Yes.  And is there another letter?  No.  That was it, I believe.  And then what's the other one?  Well, there's a third number, 1-800.  1-800.  D.  D.  U.  U.  M.  M.  B.  V.  B, B, B.  Oh, D-U-M-B. 
[00:45:30]  Um, C.  C.  U.  Yeah, that number is a private lineup.  N.  N.  I don't know if that's good or not.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Oh, that's all.  I would rather use the first one.  Well, no, this one's good, too, because I got the seven.  It's 1-800-D-U-M-B.  Yeah.  C.  U.  U.  N.  M.  N.  N.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's seven.  N.  And that's it.  You don't need the last letter because you only need seven.  So that one's good, too. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  You leave the last letter off for taking off the air.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, and there's a fourth number if you're in Canada.  You might want to use that number.  What?  1.  1.  8, 7, 7.  7, 7.  Yeah.  P.  What?  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  P.  R.  R.  I.  I.  Z.  Z. 
[00:46:30]  E.  E.  P.  P.  I.  I.  G.  Did you say P-I-G?  Yes.  Yeah.  1-877-PRIZE-P-I-G.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, that's a neat.  That's easier.  Of course.  Yeah, that's an easy one.  Use that one, then.  Right.  1-877-PRIZE-P-I-G.  That's it.  Right.  I think I'd use that one. 
[00:47:00]  I bet you should.  But you wouldn't use the others?  Um, well, I can remember the more better.  I can remember that one, more better.  More better.  Wow.  Yeah.  More better.  All right.  The other one has too many letters involved in it.  Sure.  More better.  Better.  It's not more worse, all right?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Okay, thanks a lot.  All right.  Or you can make it very easy, Louise.  Yeah?  And just call the number you called.  I mean, um, 1-877-212-K-ROCK. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, yeah, you could use that one as well.  That one might work.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I'm ready to just gouge my own eyes out at this point.  I know.  You're giving me a lot of numbers.  I think you're killing me today.  No.  Well, or you could just use the one you used.  Or if it's easier, you could use, uh...  Prize pig.  Well, that's very...  That's an easy one to remember.  But I would suggest you just use the one you called.  The one, you mean the one, the one, eight, seven...  Why is this happening? 
[00:48:00]  Shut up.  I can't take this.  Yeah, I know you do.  You're torturing me.  Do you have a redial on your phone?  Yeah.  Which, in your case, is one, two, three, four clicks down?  Yep.  Okay, well, why don't you just use that, man?  Yeah, use that.  I have a redial.  Yeah, not a speed dial, but I got a redial.  Why?  All right.  Why?  Well, we're going to start the contest in a few minutes here.  So, good luck to you, Louise.  Thank you.  Do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  I have it on right now.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Not really a fan.  But in general, do you listen?  Not just now?  No, I have it on a lot, yes.  What do you like about the show?  It's nutty.  That's why I love it.  Nutty.  All right.  That's how we like to promote it.  Nutty.  At least the bus signs are working.  Because that's what we say.  We're nutty.  We're nutty.  And it's got these guys, each with a handful of nuts, and their eyebrows raised.  Like, we don't know what happened.  Oh, wait.  You're nutty, too.  You might as well just have two walnuts in your head. 
[00:49:00]  Thana's giving me...  Painted blue or something.  That macadamia nut just staring blankly out of his face.  Two lid-covered macadamia nuts.  Wait.  Well, I would call you an ice cream soda.  That's what I'd call you.  All right.  Listen.  Why?  Thana's giving me another phone...  Louise, I apologize.  I'm getting another phone number here.  Okay.  1-877-  7-7.  8-7-7. 
[00:49:30]  1-8-7-7.  The letter I.  I.  The letter A.  A.  Letter M.  Yeah.  Letter M.  M.  Letter F.  F.  Letter A.  A.  A.  Let's see.  What is...  I can't read his handwriting.  Letter T.  T.  And we finish it off with another T.  There you go.  Yeah.  You said I am fat. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Way to get it after 20 minutes.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, good luck to you there, Louise.  Thank you.  God speak.  All right.  God speak to you and your eyes.  There goes Louise.  Yeah.  Louise from wherever.  We got to take a quick break.  And now we didn't get to do our hybrid story.  We'll do that after the break.  But we're about to start the contest between pretty much now and 7.30.  Someone out there is going to win $1,000.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:50:30]  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  I'm reading Slash's book.  Can't put the damn thing down.  I think it's just called Slash.  And what I'm learning is that when Guns N' Roses became huge, Axl stopped talking to the band.  Really?  That was it?  Slash is admitting a lot of stuff in this book.  Like, completely stopped talking to the band, basically.  I'm up to a part.  Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 come out. 
[00:51:00]  And they barely had contact with Axl.  And they only saw him on planes and on stage.  And they held it together as long as they even did.  Slash said, yeah, he was surprised how long they were able to hold it together.  It's a pretty damn good book.  He's being pretty honest with a lot of things in this book.  What a tool.  What the hell is wrong with him?  Well, it continues to this day.  Yeah.  And then I, uh, he was talking about how Axl is very self-destructive.  Well, of course.  And I'm sitting there like, eh, maybe I should pass this chapter. 
[00:51:30]  Move on to something else.  No, don't pass it.  Please read it thoroughly.  Like, wow.  I can relate to this a little bit.  Sabotaging his own success.  Oh.  And I'm like, was he?  Oh, boy, maybe I should read that chapter again.  Yeah.  Maybe this would be a good chapter to read slowly.  You should print it out in a huge font and wallpaper it on your walls at home. 
[00:52:00]  He's pretty much saying that Axl was just a complete dick.  Really?  Pretty much, without saying it.  He goes, ah, and then he's polite.  He's like, I'm sure Axl has his own version of what happened that is just as important  as mine.  But here's the true version.  Yeah.  That's basically what he's getting at.  I'm sure he's got his.  Uh, let's say hi to Carol in Brentwood.  What happened to Jimmy?  Carol, what's up?  Oh, he's in the bathroom?  Carol, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Carol. 
[00:52:30]  I'm here.  Hey, what's going on, Carol?  How are you?  Well, I'm doing okay.  Just waking up, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh, I was waiting for that funny, kind of like weird sound on the radio so that I  can call in for the book.  Ah, big fan of the, uh, show, I see.  Kind of.  What do you mean, kind of?  I can listen, I can.  How long have you been listening to the show?  With K-Rock?  No.  I've been on for a long time.  No, no, no, no.  Don't lump us into the whole K-Rock thing.  Uh, we love being on K-Rock here in New York, but Opie and Anthony, we're our own thing 
[00:53:00]  for many, many years.  How long have you been listening to the Opie and Anthony show?  For a while, on and off, and then you guys have gone for a little while there and came  back, right?  Yeah, but are you listening more because of the contest?  May I say yes?  Okay.  May I?  And here's the big, Carol, here's the big question.  What?  Uh, contest is going to end soon, I believe.  When the contest ends, what are the odds that you'll continue listening to the Opie  and Anthony radio show?  Um, pretty good.  Pretty good.  You guys are funny. 
[00:53:30]  Keep me going.  Get me up in the morning, yeah.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  We didn't play the sound yet.  Okay, then I'll keep on listening.  Yeah.  All right.  You do that.  I will.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  I really believe you.  Bye-bye.  What station do you think she goes back to after this?  Oof.  Does she do a little wake-up with Whoopi?  Uh, no.  I think it's more of a light.  Does she listen to Jim Kerr, that boar?  Hmm.  On Q104, classic rock that really rocks. 
[00:54:00]  Here's the news in between Zeppelin records.  And we might make a funny about Britney Spears.  Yuck.  Uh, hybrid, uh, cars.  Here we go.  This is what we were supposed to play in.  Yeah.  We got a little distracted.  As average gasoline prices rise above $3 a gallon, drivers are turning to hybrid vehicles  as a way to save money at the pump.  Hybrids now make up 2% of the vehicles on the road.  Ooh.  But before buying, drivers need to remember that hybrids cost more.  High-end technology, like the battery, can add $2,000 to $7,000 to the price tag. 
[00:54:30]  And recent tax credits for these vehicles have started to end.  Ah, see, we were just talking about this with Bill Burr, who moved out there to Hollywood  and, uh, got himself a hybrid vehicle, driving it around, and, I don't know, I was trying  to have a little discussion with him, but he gets a little, he gets a little edgy.  Yeah.  And, uh, he gets very defensive about his, uh, hybrid vehicle and how he's going green 
[00:55:00]  and saving the, uh, planet and saving money on gas.  Well, uh, you know, when, uh, people first started buying hybrids, they actually were saving  money.  Yeah.  Now, if you buy a hybrid, you're just doing the, uh, the ultimate, you're trying to save  the environment, but you're not saving yourself any bucks anymore.  No.  That's awful.  It, uh, it, uh, it just takes how long, uh, that's there.  Well, this is the stat right here.  The Wall Street Journal and car researcher Edmunds compared hybrids to conventional cars  driven 15,000 miles a year with gas at $2.79 a gallon. 
[00:55:30]  It found that it could take 17 years to make up the $3,700 extra cost for the best-selling  Toyota Camry hybrid compared to the conventional gas-powered Camry.  The popular Honda Civic has a hybrid version, but it costs nearly $1,500 more than the regular  Civic.  It would take four and a half years to make up the difference in price.  So obviously you're not saving a damn thing because no one keeps their car for 17 years 
[00:56:00]  at this point.  No.  And, uh, Steve from Bayshore, I guess, commenting on the, uh, there are 2% of them on the road.  He says that the hybrid cars represent 79% of all vehicles parked in rest stops.  Jimmy, where were you?  Sorry.  What happened?  Just in the office.  With the boys?  No, just with...  Just having a fun chit-chat.  About the, uh, the fart word? 
[00:56:30]  Just silly.  Just silly.  Was it about that?  Yeah.  We're trying to do something that we think would be fun radio, but we have to change the  name of the contest, which is just so ridiculous and silly.  Well, we'll...  I can't even be bothered with this crap anymore.  We'll deal with it off the air.  Yeah.  We're just chit-chatting.  Let's deal with it off the air.  That's just a little frustrating.  That's...  I understand.  We have a great concept for a little trivia contest, but we need to call it what it is.  I have a trivia contest.  Who's the most ungrateful bitch on the planet? 
[00:57:00]  And the answer, Harry's girlfriend.  God, does she suck?  I don't know what you guys are on, but I'm just gonna smash her face.  What's wrong with Harry's girlfriend?  She dumped him.  He's a prince, and she dumped him because he didn't want to do her birthday party.  He didn't want to go to her birthday party.  He went to a soccer match instead of her birthday party.  He's gonna run England.  Soccer's very important.  Who gives a crap?  God bless this shit.  He's going to run England.  Soccer's very important to them.  No matter what they do, no matter what you do as a guy, it's never enough for these brawls. 
[00:57:30]  It's never...  There's always something.  Wait, you are reacting right now like you are him, and she just did this to you.  Wow, you really get caught up in that.  It annoys me so much.  Wait a minute.  I gotta take her side.  What's...  Ooh.  I'll tell you what's wrong with it.  Keep being catty.  He blew off her birthday.  God, he's a prince.  That's one...  He could run England.  Is nothing enough for these chicks?  She could be a princess. 
[00:58:00]  He's never gonna run England.  Maybe he won't, but the point is, he's still...  He's an heir to the throne.  He didn't go to her party.  Maybe he's not some royal...  One of these people that loves the royals.  Well, technically he's not, because the Duke of Windsor has to talk to the Lady of Spent.  Shut up.  Who cares?  It's all incest.  By the time he gets down to Harry there, you know...  Prince Charles is, what, in his 60s now, and there's not even a chance he's winning it, you know, gonna be running England anytime soon.  That's because the Crypt Keeper just won't lie down and kick the dirt nap already. 
[00:58:30]  How old is Prince Charles?  That poor guy's been waiting his entire life to run England, and he's still running.  They don't even run it.  They sit there and...  And no one listens.  They got a prime minister that runs things.  You know what?  God bless this broad that she doesn't go for that crap.  She's a dope.  And she's a dope because...  Why is she a dope?  She probably has some royalty in her own family or something.  Yeah, she's probably no slouch.  It's just the idea that this guy, the life you can have with this guy, and it's just like they always find something. 
[00:59:00]  It's not like he punched her in the mouth.  The life she could have, hanging out with an unfaithful old English troll, and then being wrapped around a pole in a tunnel in France.  That's what I'm talking about.  I like it.  Enough with that anorexic, too.  She's probably puking out the window.  That's why she died.  She was vomiting that nice dinner Doty just bought her.  I have to look skinny.  We get it.  We get it.  Could you put your head back in your crown? 
[00:59:30]  It's sticking out.  And stop strapping it around your chin.  You look like an ass.  We know.  You're the people's princess.  We've heard.  The people's princess.  She was a weak woman.  No, she was.  I love how they make her look like she was this big, you know, strong woman.  She was so strong.  Because she stayed in the marriage and stuff.  No, you were a weak woman that just stayed with that crap for all those years.  Must get rid of the landmines.  I like the fact that he was in a bar.  He spent a $5,000 bar bill that night with a bunch of his friends.  He was a drunk. 
[01:00:00]  Good boy.  Well, I love Harry.  Sounds like Friday night, as a matter of fact.  Prince Anthony.  She was fed up with Harry's playboy lifestyle and was miffed.  He had opted to skip her 22nd birthday party last month for a rugby match in Paris.  What was she going to do on her birthday?  What would have been fun?  What's more fun than the jet-setting lifestyle they live?  What, do you have cake for her?  If you blow off your girlfriend's birthday, you expect her to completely understand?  No. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  I'm Jim Norton.  Let me explain the differences.  Yes.  I don't run a country.  I'm not a prince.  Yeah.  He's probably an ass.  I'm sure he is.  He's a rosacea-faced idiot.  Those red cheeks, they're terrible looking.  Yeah, it's very English.  Yeah, just rosy red, sloppable cheeks.  He's got a very Pink Floyd the Wall-ish kind of look to him.  However, to date that guy, it's amazing how they always find something. 
[01:01:00]  No matter what place in your life you're in, there's always a woman who's just going to  hit, beat, beat, beat, hit, beat.  They're going to find something that you're not doing.  Which birthday was it?  How old?  For 22nd.  It's not even a monumental one.  Oh, okay.  I was thinking of a milestone birthday, 21, sweet 16, 29.  You shouldn't blow off your chick's birthday.  You guys are insane.  What are you going to do?  Take her out?  He probably would have seen her after or whatever, but he was always out of the country.  Could you come back for my birthday?  For what?  What are we going to do?  You missed my birthday. 
[01:01:30]  Up.  Bunch of her and her dumb friends kvetching.  Good for Harry.  He doesn't like you.  You leave him.  Yeah.  Do you think I should?  And then she'll go after him.  One of her friends.  That's what he should do.  He should run through all of her friends and leave something on every one of their faces.  Go say hello to her.  That's what I would do.  I would run through.  I would actually get her.  I would have one of my people steal her phone book, and I would check off everyone on that list that was female. 
[01:02:00]  And even a few males if they were related to her, just to straighten them out.  Tell her what I did to you.  Beat it.  I say good for her that she's not going for all that horse ass.  All that crap.  That's just another example of a chick.  Nothing's good enough.  And I can see if he was going to be...  It's a birthday.  You can't blow off your chick's birthday ever.  Whether you're in line to be the prince or the king. 
[01:02:30]  She's going to have to get used to that because he does a lot of traveling.  Or if you work in a deli.  It's the same thing.  You can't blow off a chick's birthday ever.  Why?  My birthday's irrelevant to me.  Dinner's nice.  I agree with you.  Dinner's nice.  But it's not like he just went out.  He was out of the country doing something.  She thought he should not have done what he wanted to do in another country.  And when he could have taken her out the week after.  I'm sure he sent her a Rolls Royce or something.  Who cares about her birthday?  What are we going to do on your birthday?  Let's go out to dinner.  Okay.  And then what?  I opened the gift that you got me.  That's more expensive than any gift any guy will ever get me. 
[01:03:00]  How good for you.  How about I fly on a private plane somewhere?  You want that?  Nothing's good enough for them.  No matter what stage of your life, they're always going to snivel about something.  You don't do this.  Wow.  What happened over the years?  Absolutely nothing.  Something's going on, man.  I had a great weekend.  You're in a good place?  Yeah, we're in a very good place.  But if you decide you're going to go out with a girl or get married and stuff, there's  just things you shouldn't blow off.  I mean, you could live as a single playboy and then you could go do whatever the F you 
[01:03:30]  want.  But if you're in a relationship, you can't blow off a chick's birthday ever.  So he should have said that I can't go to another country and do this, which is what  he was doing.  Instead of saying, I'll take you out in a couple of days.  I look at my own birthday.  I don't care about my own birthday.  So why not?  But if I expect you to be at my birthday, just make sure you're there and then I don't  do it for you.  That's different.  But I could care less.  If you're busy on my birthday, I will do it a couple of days.  Right.  It's a big deal.  It's a chick.  It's just a chick complaining like a chick. 
[01:04:00]  That's you, Jimmy.  And she's trying to show him that I don't care if you're the prince.  Yeah, really?  You don't care who's the prince?  She's going to go out with some soccer hooligan.  Exactly.  Next.  Oh, please.  She's just trying to put her dumb foot down.  And she's trying to show who the boss is.  And he knows it's him.  That's what she's doing.  I don't want to.  Oh, you've got to come to the party.  Let's go to Brent in New Jersey.  Brent. 
[01:04:30]  Tell us.  Hey.  Look, I got to say, I agree with Jimmy on this one.  Because the match that he went to see was the Rugby World Cup final.  Oh, the Rugby World Cup final.  Wow.  Well, I didn't know it was that.  I thought it was just the Rugby match.  Is that like the Super Bowl here?  Would that be like the Super Bowl?  A little bit bigger.  I mean, it's every four years.  No, the first.  Stop.  There's nothing bigger than the Super Bowl.  Well.  Okay.  The World Cup is way bigger than this.  Oh, it is not to us. 
[01:05:00]  Is it every four years they do the Rugby World Cup?  Yeah.  Every four years?  Is that what he's going for?  It's a dumb thing.  Obviously, us dumb Americans think that because it's an American thing that it's the biggest.  But I think the World Cup is bigger than the Super Bowl.  And I don't know.  Maybe this Rugby World Cup is actually bigger as far as the whole world goes.  Rugby.  All right, Brent.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So what are you going to do?  But it's Rugby.  That was a good one.  All right, buddy.  You're going to go to the Super Bowl or your team's in the World Series and you want to 
[01:05:30]  go to a game and your chick is going, it's my 22nd birthday.  And you're like, this is the World Series.  There we go.  I didn't realize it was the World Match.  This is the World Series.  Yeah.  But it's my 22nd birthday and I want to go to dinner.  You'd want to spit on her.  Why can't we do it next week?  I think it was the final straw if you read the article.  Oh, you probably.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the guy's obviously probably not taking, you know, their relationship  seriously.  Very seriously.  And he's running around doing his playboy thing and this was the last straw, I'm thinking. 
[01:06:00]  What's up, C-Bass?  Opie.  Yeah.  What happened to you?  What?  You become soft after being engaged.  You're defending Prince Harry's girlfriend?  Yeah, because I think that whole royalty thing is a complete joke.  It's nice to see that someone's not falling for that crap.  I think half a year ago you would have had a different story.  You would have said F her.  No, not really.  I have always hated that royalty thing.  Well, it's not even for me.  And I love when these people get smashed in the face and something, you know, goes wrong 
[01:06:30]  in their life.  I agree with you.  But it's not about the royalty for me.  It's just simply that it proves that no matter where you are, no matter what you do, something  won't be good enough.  Something they'll have to find and poke their beaks in.  Something.  No matter what.  Hold on, buddy.  No matter what it is, their beaks will poke in the window.  Picture this.  You're in your car.  You're doing everything you can.  And that beak comes in the window. 
[01:07:00]  You're not doing this.  Their beaks.  I like when the royal family gets smashed.  So, yeah, I'm taking the broad side.  God forbid.  Going to have to agree to disagree on this one.  Oh, boy, I totally disagree with her.  They're beaks.  And again, I don't like the royal family at all.  It's not about him being royal.  It's just simply, it's that pattern that you can do 80 things, and the one thing you 
[01:07:30]  don't is the thing they bring up time and time again.  Now, this is based on something, Jimmy.  You're going to a deep place with this.  Yes, you are.  I have more metal.  Maybe you don't want to share, and that's okay.  No, no, no, no.  It's not even about me.  I've been sitting across from here for a while.  I could tell there's a little personal.  No.  Not at all.  No.  A personal punch to this rat.  No, no, no, not at all.  I had a great weekend with my girlfriend. 
[01:08:00]  I did the MySpace show Friday, then I was gone Saturday.  So yesterday, we had a nice dinner.  But let's just say in my relationship, let's just say I do 80 things, and then there's  that one thing that I'm not good at.  Let's just say it would get brought up time and time again.  What would this thing be if you were, I don't know.  I don't know.  It could be anything.  It could be we spend too much time in my apartment, not enough time in hers. 
[01:08:30]  It could be that.  All right.  You've brought that up in the past.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It could be that.  It could be anything.  Yeah.  And I actually see it your way on that one, by the way, because your apartment is way  better than hers.  So why would you want to?  Well, I don't even look at it like it's better.  I just do it because she has roommates.  That's all it is for me is the privacy issue.  It's not about, like, I don't care if mine's bigger or whatever.  I'd still hang out in her place.  Yeah.  I like the fact that she wants me there.  You don't want roomies?  No, but I like the fact that she wants to share her space with me and stuff.  She said, like, you know, I want you in my life and I want you in my place too, which  I like that she's not trying to keep me out of her. 
[01:09:00]  It is just simply the other people there.  I've lived with roommates before.  It's fine.  But if you could be alone or be with them, I'm very private.  Yeah.  You're past that point in your life.  I just hated it.  I just, because I lived at my family until I was 30.  And then I moved in with Jim Florentine and his girlfriend at the time.  And so it was like, you know, for the first 34 years of my life, or 33 or 34, I couldn't  walk naked around my place.  What a sin.  I know.  That's just a sin.  But you know what I mean?  So it's like now I'm 39. 
[01:09:30]  I've only been five years without just alone.  Right.  You're kind of just walking around noodle.  All the time.  All the time.  I haven't closed a bathroom door since, what is it?  Oh, one.  I haven't closed a bathroom door since oh, one.  That's fantastic.  Cool is that.  It's a good feeling, right?  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  People are split on this one.  Yeah.  I'm sure some guys are going to see it the other way.  But it has nothing.  I'm macing the royal family just because it was such a stupid thing she's mad at. 
[01:10:00]  But to me, it's no matter what stage you're in.  There's something that they're going to harp on.  Girls take their birthdays very seriously.  And all they do is...  I'm kind of with you.  When my birthday comes up, yeah, I want it to be acknowledged.  It would be nice to open up some or do something like dinner or something.  But girls, man, they look at it completely different.  You can't miss their birthday.  But I don't care about their birthday.  You're getting older.  That's all it's going to do is make me not like you as much.  But I'm just saying...  What's the matter with you?  Oh, Jesus.  But I'm just saying they do care.  If you were getting younger, I'd celebrate every year. 
[01:10:30]  Look, I'm going to be 17 this year.  Hoorah!  Let's go out and get you a pony ride, toots.  Birthday's a biggie for women.  I know.  Maybe there's other things they don't care about as much, but that's one that...  What?  I'd love to know one thing they don't care about as much.  Well, maybe we can go to the phones after a break and find that out.  Hopefully some will have an answer.  Maybe somebody...  I mean, you're right to say that your birthday's not a big deal.  Well, I'm trying to think the last time my birthday was a big deal.  You went to dinner. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, it's my birthday.  I want it to be acknowledged, but past that, Christmas is not a big deal to me anymore.  I think Christmas will mean something when I finally have kids.  Birthday's a biggie.  But I could give a crap about Christmas year after year.  I actually like Thanksgiving over Christmas.  That's more of hanging out with the family and stuff.  Just eating.  The extended family and just hanging out.  You don't have the pressure of trying to figure out what to buy everybody and the stress  of going shopping and all that kind of stuff.  I don't have that pressure anymore.  Gave up.  Gave up on it. 
[01:11:30]  Now, I just flee the area.  Flee!  Just leave.  Go on vacation somewhere.  Like, I'm just not around.  I'm not available.  What are you doing this Christmas?  Don't know, but I'm not going to end up in stores trying to figure out what grandma wants.  So you're not going to buy it?  Will you be giving people checks?  I might.  I might cut some gift certificates or something or some of those American Express gift cards.  The whole Kumiya clan just turned up their radios. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, God.  What's his answer?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Is he going to be giving the big checks this year?  Oh, God.  Oh, please say yes.  Please say yes.  It could go either way with the checks this year?  For years it was just going over grandma's house and then everyone would be there and  everyone's got presents for everybody else and it turns into this big thing and it's a  pain in the ass for months before that.  And then they decide, I think, last year, I think we're going to do like, you get a gift  for this person, this one gets one for that person, sort of grab bag style. 
[01:12:30]  Well, Anthony must have been the one.  Oh, my God.  Look, I'll trade you three uncles and a mom for Anthony.  A big announcement to my family.  We're too old for Secret Santa.  Stop.  You don't want to do the Secret Santa?  Whatever sibling's going to start the Secret Santa thing this year, just stop.  Don't do it.  It sucks.  We're all over 30 at this point.  Stop with the Secret Santa thing, please.  Why does it have to carry on to when you get older than like 10? 
[01:13:00]  I'm more worried about what to buy your kids.  I don't need to worry about buying a gift for somebody.  The Secret Santa thing blows.  I know it to get kids cash.  Kids love greenbacks.  They just love opening up a card and seeing a president staring them in the face.  Ooh.  They can buy whatever they want.  I like to give kids knowledge.  Like my nephew this year, he's 11.  He'll love this.  It's a book on the history of that river in Washington, the Potomac River.  Of course. 
[01:13:30]  The Potomac River's history and all the historic things that have happened along it.  I'm sure he'll cherish it.  That's right.  It's going to be a good history teaching.  My nine-year-old nephew is going to get a book, The History of Spores.  To learn about spores?  Yeah.  Everything you need to know about spores.  Spores for dummies.  That's kind of like Fungus in a Nutshell, which is what I got him last year.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Dan, we get it.  We got a break.  I know.  Break, break, break, break, break.  Break, break, break, break, break, break, break. 
[01:14:00]  Somebody won the $1,000, so you can stop calling.  We'll figure out who that winner is next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right.  I'm going to be, hey, what's up?  This is Bob Kelly.  I'm going to be at the Laughing Post in Michigan.  Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo, Michigan, on November 29th and November 30th.  That's Kalamazoo, Michigan.  What the fuck are you doing?  I finally got one right, and you fucked it up with your gay cell phone ring. 
[01:14:30]  I don't give a shit.  The first time I ever did a dumb promo that came out correctly, and your stupid gay alarm  comes.  All right.  Now, I want you to do it.  What are you going to do?  Ah, just go to my MySpace.  This is Bob Kelly.  Go to my MySpace.  MySpace.com.  Backward slash.  Wow.  Robert Kelly live.  Go now.  Ain't nothing going to break my stride.  Nobody going to slow me down. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no.  I've got to keep up moving.  Ain't nothing going to break my stride.  I'm running in a warm touch ground.  Hey, good morning.  It's all the veterans.  It's Veterans Day.  Veterans Day.  Opie and Anthony with you.  We got a winner.  I don't know who it is, though.  Don't know who it is.  What city?  What?  This dude?  All right. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, Steve, you won $1,000, right?  I hope so.  Steve.  Steve, where are you calling from?  Hey, Harrison.  What?  Harrison.  Where's that?  It's Westchester.  Oh, Westchester?  Yeah.  All right.  Congratulations.  You won $1,000.  Thank you so much, guys.  You'll see me every morning.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  We've got to move on, though, today.  So we've got to go quick with the winner today.  Harlequin.  She's a girl from Buffalo, New York, listening on the edge. 
[01:16:00]  The home of Shred and Reagan.  She writes, the birthday was the last straw.  I mean, everyone is talking about Jimmy's rant.  Hey, people are, some are agreeing with you as well, Jimmy.  Do you care less if they agree or disagree?  Lisa came running in here and said, you know, what did she say to you?  She's like, I think she asked if someone was hassling me, like, is my girl hassling me?  I'm like, no.  But it was, she's like, yeah, I'd probably go to the World Series with you.  Like, I used the World Series rant.  I didn't realize it was that big of a match, even.  Right.  But it just goes to prove that no matter what you're doing, you're going to bitch about something. 
[01:16:30]  I'm not giving you some Tom Likas rant, like, ah, women are terrible.  But it's just a fact that no matter how much you do, it's just, there's, people talk about  being henpecked, and that's why.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Let the prince go.  And watch.  He's got death threats.  Do you know how many people want to murder this guy?  Yeah.  Let the guy go watch the game with his friends.  I understand he's rich, and it's not just about that.  It's the fact that he's going to have security for the rest of his life, because people would 
[01:17:00]  love to chop his head off because of his country's policies.  Let the guy go watch the game with his friends, and you and your dumb 22nd birthday, go have  some cake with your other stupid hens, and peck your beaks together.  Peck, peck.  What else does he do?  Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.  Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.  Oh my God.  It's unbelievable.  It really, it's kind of, this is going to a deep place.  Oh, it drives me nuts. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, I did see your point, but now it seems a little more personal, but.  No.  I could be wrong.  No, no, no.  I think it's good.  You want to just, I don't, well, Harley Quinn writes, the birthday was the last straw  for her.  She didn't let the fact that he's a prince cloud her judgment.  And, of course, talking about Prince Harry, his chick broke up with him because he missed her 22nd birthday because he was at the World Rugby match in Paris.  Right. OK. If he's blowing her off while they're dating, what's going to happen if they get married? 
[01:18:00]  The things he does now marks what he will do later.  Yeah. That's what Harlequin is saying in Buffalo.  All right. I'm sure Harlequin in Buffalo has a similar lifestyle and experience that this woman and the prince have.  I'm sure her 22nd birthday, her husband was probably eating wings and then on the toilet for nine hours and couldn't take her out.  That's probably why. Because he's an alcoholic.  All right. Melanie in Nashville, Tennessee. Melanie, what's up?  Good morning, boy.  Hey.  He did what every other man in this world would do. 
[01:18:30]  Well, every other man has the balls to do it.  Yeah. If I were him, I would have blown her off, too.  Look, the bottom line is the birthday is nice. It's nice to go out to dinner.  I think that's nice. And my girl's birthday, I'll always take her out to dinner unless I'm working or something. I can't.  Yeah.  But it's like, this is a guy, I know he's a privileged prince and the royal family sucks, but on the other side, there really is a 24-hour death threat on the dude. 
[01:19:00]  And if that's one of the things he likes doing with his friends, just let him do it. Just shut your mouth.  He could have a hot chick at the drop of a dime.  Yeah.  All right, Melanie.  So drop her, get everybody else.  I like the fact that she was sulking and he just went out and ran up a $5,000 bar bill.  How great is it to know that you kicked and screamed your 22nd birthday and he probably replaced you within an hour.  Good.  Exactly.  He had a terrific game.  All right, Melanie. Thank you. Let's go to John in Jersey. 
[01:19:30]  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, what's up?  I don't think it's the fact that this lady likes to complain.  I think it's the fact that she loves it.  You are 100% right.  Linger and longer.  Linger and longer.  She doesn't enjoy complaining.  She loves complaining.  Complaining and breathing have an equal sign in between them for her.  Almighty. 
[01:20:00]  I can't even find your calming music today, unfortunately.  We haven't played it in a while.  Jimmy, you know what?  I just want it standing by just in case.  Because you never know.  You never know.  The moment has passed.  But where is it?  Just in case.  And now my nose.  I'm trying to get hooked on nose spray again.  No, you're not.  Because my nose is ruining my life.  Last night, I went to bed at 11 o'clock last night.  The earliest I've gone to bed in nine years.  Yeah.  And of course, my nose was so congested. 
[01:20:30]  So I had to spray again.  And now this morning, it's itchy and leaky a little bit.  So I'm starting to get to that place.  I'm going to get hooked on a nose spray again.  I remember you were spraying all the time.  I want to put a gun on my nose.  I don't want to kill myself.  I want to shoot my nose and sinus.  Is there any way to put a bullet through your sinuses so it clears you out?  Well, what are you going to do?  Are you going to get an operation?  I don't know.  I hear all these reports.  I want to know if I can find who to go to.  A guy that's really good and is going to fix my nose.  Is he reputable?  You might lose that beautiful tone to your voice. 
[01:21:00]  A lot of people don't get the nose fix because they're afraid.  There's a lot of singers.  Billy Joel.  They don't want to do that.  But I think you'll be all right.  What am I going to talk like this?  Who cares?  When you come out talking like this, hey.  I just want my nose.  Or like this.  You've got a beautiful tone, Jimmy.  Don't mess it up.  My voice is awful anyway.  How great would that be?  Just to come in with a totally different voice.  Something I missed.  Like, hello, baby.  What's up?  We got your feel-good story.  It's feel-good story Monday. 
[01:21:30]  We try to find just a nice story that we all could just go, aww,  and feel good about ourselves.  Because there's just such awfulness in the world out there every day.  Yeah.  There's nothing but bad news all the time.  So we pick one story every Monday.  We play it for you.  And it's just that feel-good story of the day for this fine Monday.  Are you guys ready for the feel-good story for today?  Of course.  All right.  Here it is.  Wearing nothing but a gown because detectives took his clothes as evidence, 
[01:22:00]  convicted sex offender James Walker is headed back to jail  after serving a seven-year sentence.  Mr. Walker came underneath that stall, forced him against the wall,  held him against his will, forcibly fondled him.  Walker's 15-year-old victim stopped to use the bathroom while on his way to school.  Oh, Jesus.  This guy just lost his mind.  He's got to have it.  Yeah, the perv switch definitely went off.  Oh, he's in the bathroom.  I need it. 
[01:22:30]  There's a young lad right next to me in the next stall.  He's right there.  I can't take it.  I've got to pin him against the wall.  I'm crawling under the stall.  I have to.  I have to.  He just lost his mind.  After the sexual assault, a grounds crew contacted police,  capturing Walker as he attempted to run.  What, a grounds crew in between the seventh inning stretch?  Yeah.  This is what they do when they're not, like, breaking out the big rake?  No, the grounds crew were able to multitask like this. 
[01:23:00]  After the sexual assault, a grounds crew contacted police,  capturing Walker as he attempted to run.  I wasn't even over there, man.  Why are you guys harassing me?  Police say Walker had just been released from state prison in April  after serving seven years on a 15-year sentence for sexually molesting yet another child.  For seven years?  He's being held without bond in a blue.  Why is he out in seven years for molesting a child? 
[01:23:30]  Now he's being held without bond.  Well, they showed him a 15-year sentence.  He should be in there for 15 years.  You rob a bank, you don't get out for 25 years.  Anything with property in this stupid country.  You molest the kid, you're out in seven years.  Seven years of a 15-year sentence.  You know, the feel-good part of that story, of course, is that the guy will now go back to prison.  I was just going to get something to eat.  Yeah, I'm sure you did.  Yeah, well.  Why don't you take a seat over there?  Poor guy. 
[01:24:00]  Unbelievable.  So this is the second time he couldn't take it.  Right.  Probably more than that.  Perhaps more than that.  But he's right back at it again.  There's people like...  The cases of recurring crimes when it comes to these creatures, it's just like 100%.  These guys get out, and they go right back to doing what they were doing. 
[01:24:30]  Why the hell let them out?  Sterilization.  Mandatory sterilization.  Yeah, I agree.  Just clip, snippy-snip, and you're done.  But we're a democratic society.  Yes, that's cruel and unusual punishment as opposed to ruining a life because of what you did when they were younger.  Very good job.  Let's say hi to Robert.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Jimmy, I just want to let you know that I had two surgeries about eight years ago. 
[01:25:00]  One surgery on my sinuses, and I got worse after that.  I went to a guy up in Mount Sinai.  He drilled a hole in my head over my eye.  And that thing hurt like...  Jeffrey Dahmer?  Did he pour bleach in there?  You're not...  Jimmy, the guy put like this noodle, a straw, in my sinus.  It used to leak out through the bottom of my nose.  It was the grossest thing for six weeks, and within two months, I haven't had a sinus infection in eight years. 
[01:25:30]  So what?  The one guy, the guy who drilled the hole in your head helped you or no?  Yeah, the first guy did regular sinus surgery, and that's all, you know, it's all BS.  It doesn't work.  Why?  It makes your nose bigger.  It makes...  No, I didn't get a nose job.  I just got...  No, no, I mean the passageways inside bigger, so you can breathe better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what happens is, what they don't explain to you, is that you end up, some people get scar tissue, and it just made my nose worse within six months. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  This guy went in there and took care of the scar tissue, and it's really been a lot better.  I mean, the guy's a wet job.  The guy, I don't want to say his name.  Right, don't.  Yeah, the guy's in the OR, they seek Heil to the guy before the surgery.  He has this whole running joke with everybody in the OR that he's like a Nazi.  I don't care what is running...  Good.  Let Anthony Opera...  Don't hang up. 
[01:26:30]  Give Travis your info or the guy's info.  Yeah.  I don't...  No problem.  Thanks, man.  By the way, Jimmy...  Hey, Jimmy, I'm Jewish, and it wasn't fun to watch that happen before I went under.  But he did help your nose.  Yes, he absolutely did.  Thank you.  But he really would do that to a Jewish patient?  He's in Mount Sinai, for God's sake, the Jewish hospital.  All right.  Well, thank you there.  He's on hold.  I don't understand people that don't do their research.  We had a story here in New York.  This woman went to a dentist in, like, Chinatown. 
[01:27:00]  This is a story that was...  It's about two weeks old now.  She went to this dentist in Chinatown.  The guy obviously didn't really know what he was doing.  And let's just put it this way.  She passed out because I guess he gave her too much.  I need more details in this story.  But basically, something went horribly wrong in the dentist's chair.  With the anesthesia.  And he just put her out on the sidewalk.  Yep.  He freaked out.  He put her out on the sidewalk and went back inside, hoping that someone would find her. 
[01:27:30]  Maybe it'll just go away.  Did she end up dying?  Yeah, I think she did.  I think she might have died on the sidewalk.  And the family's like, what the F?  And they figured out that, you know, that on her planner or something, she was seeing a dentist that day.  And the story goes that something went awfully wrong.  And the guy, instead of, like, you know, maybe calling somebody or doing something, he figured it would go away by just putting her out on the sidewalk to die.  Hey, did you see the dentist footage?  It was on...  I saw the train yesterday on CBS or something.  Oh, that guy that lost his mind and started pushing the woman. 
[01:28:00]  Wait, what's this one?  This dentist was trying to get into a parking lot and there was a car blocking.  Do you know the full story?  His name was Dr. Moody.  Was I?  It was all moody.  Yeah.  There was a Mercedes, apparently.  And I can understand how you would get pissed off at this.  There's a Mercedes blocking the entrance with the hazard lights on and trunk up to a parking garage.  So this Dr. Moody gets out and starts yelling at the guy.  He's like, move your goddamn car.  And he jumps in the guy's car to try to move it. 
[01:28:30]  And shoves him out of the way.  And shoves him out of the way.  So this guy is, like, yelling at Dr. Moody.  Dr. Moody gets out and goes to get into his car to leave.  And the guy that owns the Mercedes, his sister or somebody else, a relative, and it's a woman,  comes walking up to Dr. Moody and starts giving him, you know, a little guff.  Dr. Moody just mushes her and pushes her right down on the ground.  Well, she touched him to shove her or something.  He shoved her hard on the ground. 
[01:29:00]  He pushed her so hard she flew back on her ass.  And the other guy punched him.  The other guy.  Yeah, the other guy punched Dr. Moody in the face.  And Dr. Moody was subsequently arrested.  He was a big guy, Dr. Moody, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Dr. Moody.  Just a dentist.  Miserable with his job.  Just all angry.  Yeah.  Dentists are a weird, weird bunch of people.  I think they have a very high suicide rate.  They absolutely do.  I don't think a lot of them are very happy.  I think they bring pain to people's lives.  So even though in the long run it's good, but I think they bring pain to people's lives 
[01:29:30]  and they know it.  I think it's the rotting smell of mouths that just get to them eventually.  That does it?  Yeah.  Hey, here's the story.  Brooklyn Dental patient left on curb dies.  All right.  She was 71.  She was dumped unconscious on the curb by a bogus Brooklyn dentist.  The guy didn't even go all the way with his education.  Yeah, that amazes me.  A lot of times these people are practicing medicine and they have nothing.  This guy is accused of carrying the Manhattan woman to the sidewalk below his Coney Island. 
[01:30:00]  Okay, it was in Coney Island.  Offices after she began foaming at the mouth and lost consciousness.  I didn't put her on the cyclone over there at Coney Island and just say, look, she must  have had a heart attack.  She's an old broad on the cyclone.  Had she not?  Say that with like cotton in her mouth.  Novocaine.  Her family was saying that had she not went to that dentist that day, she would still be  here with us.  You don't know that.  That's going to hurt his practice.  He doesn't have a license and he killed somebody.  Yeah, that could hurt.  He should put that in his hand.  Only one dead. 
[01:30:30]  It'll probably never happen again, folks.  Can I comment on something Iraq did that was like really ridiculous?  Yeah.  There was a special report that was on for a couple of seconds and there's a big plume  of smoke over London.  Something happened.  They're saying it's not terrorism, by the way.  They are?  Yeah.  I wouldn't know this.  You know why?  Why?  Because Iraq, in order to maybe, because I kind of looked at him like, what is that?  To get a better story, better angle on the story, switch to the CW11 news. 
[01:31:00]  Iraq.  Why would you go to the, they're doing morning workout dancing.  When the story came on, it was on Good Morning America and they flipped back to their interview.  Exactly.  Who cares about good, but you know where you go when a breaking world story happens?  Tell me where you go.  Fox News.  Or write.  CNN over Fox News.  CNN over Fox News.  By the way.  If you want to have a little fun, go to Fox News.  If you need, if you want to have a little entertainment value.  To know what's going on. 
[01:31:30]  Although they're all bad, but.  That's where you go.  I would say Fox is the worst.  CNN is the best.  And MSNBC is kind of in the middle.  That's, that's how I rate them.  But if you want kind of entertainment, then you go to Fox.  If you want a little, uh.  Mapping of Muslim communities supported, uh.  Community.  Do you support the mapping of Muslim communities?  Yes.  Yeah, sure.  I support that.  There's a great article in the Post.  Where's that?  That's the one in England.  Is that England?  Uh, yeah.  See?  See, Iraq?  Look.  Turn it off quick. 
[01:32:00]  I'm watching a burning England there.  I'm watching England burn.  And on Fox 5 News, uh, Intel to unveil a chip for improving internet video quality.  Interesting story.  I like it.  But I kind of want to know about that.  And the CW-11 is the last resort.  I swear to God.  If, if I saw Russian MiGs flying out the window bombing our building, I wouldn't go there  if, if every other station was off the air. 
[01:32:30]  That put the point across how I wouldn't ever go there.  All right.  Go to the local channels.  I'm going to see how they're reporting the London, uh, story there.  Local.  Local.  Here we go.  Yep.  Like local is 2, 4, 7, 9, 11.  Do you watch television, Iraq?  What?  Well, we don't need HD.  We don't need HD.  Info.  Well, Channel 4 is doing shadow traffic.  Channel 2 is a humidifier ad.  Yep.  Let's see.  Where else?  Channel 7 is, uh. 
[01:33:00]  7th is traffic.  Trapped traffic.  And Channel 11 is, uh, have fun out there.  And Channel 7 is a fat, a fat weatherman.  And Channel 9, nothing.  Channel 9 is actually doing sitcoms.  They don't even do anything.  CNN has England burning.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, nobody cares.  That's all.  I just wanted to know.  That's all.  Let's see if, uh, it might be some of that, uh, what you call terrorism.  Let's go to Mike in Pittstown.  Hey.  Where's Pittstown?  Uh, Hunterman County.  Hey. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  So what do you got?  Uh, my old dentist went to jail for shooting his ex-wife who worked in the office.  His name was Dr. Rambo.  No.  Yeah.  It's a job for his blood.  So, so he shot his wife?  His ex-wife still worked in the office and I guess they had an argument.  And he, and, uh, he's doing some time.  Dr. Rambo.  Oh.  How does it, how do you figure out in your mind that, you know, this is going to take 
[01:34:00]  care of the problem?  It's just a moment of rage, I think.  You don't care.  You don't care.  Yeah, believe me, I get it.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Do I.  Oh, oh, boy.  You got it.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Nothing, actually.  I'm actually in a really good place.  How were your pancakes?  What pancakes?  You liked pancakes on Sunday.  I do.  I didn't have any.  I was on a train coming home.  No pancakes.  That's why.  That's why you're a little, uh, a little edgy.  No, we had fun yesterday.  I, I, I, we went up from back to the football.  Did she boo you?  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Joke. 
[01:34:30]  Boo.  No, she didn't boo me at all.  All right.  We had a wonderful evening.  And we had sex, which I did okay at.  Oh, you were, you were okay this time?  I said okay, not good.  Oh, okay.  If it was Rotten Tomatoes, like, what percentage?  Three.  Three percent good?  Yeah.  An improvement.  My performance.  That's exactly what was, that's exactly what I was trying to, trying to, uh, make her feel  good with a Rotten Tomato.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Oh, my failure.  And continue. 
[01:35:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On your radio now.  On your radio now.  877-212-ONA.  Also got the PalTalk cameras, the instant feedback.  Very interactive radio show here.  Plenty of ways to get in touch with the program.  Uh, we did the football thing.  Uh, former President Bush goes skydiving again.  Uh, it's kind of a yearly thing he does on his birthday.  Kind of getting a little creepy now, though.  He's 83. 
[01:35:30]  You know what really looks, uh, odd?  That camera view of his face as he's plummeting.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah, you get older and, wow.  There's a lot more real estate to pull back.  But he's, uh, doing that every year until he dies, I guess.  Yeah.  What else is going on that anyone cares about?  Oh, the UK man, yeah, who made 15,000 calls to women asking them about their underwear.  He's going to jail for two years.  Two years for that?  This guy's great. 
[01:36:00]  What's the, uh, what's the charge?  Like harassment or something?  Well, the underwear-obsessed telephone stalker's undoing proved to be the opening of a gym opposite the apartment  that the 40-year-old shared with his mother.  Detectives caught Paul, uh, Kavanaugh, okay, on film, leaning over the balcony of the West London apartment  just as he was peppering the gym's female receptionist with calls.  Jailed for two and a half years Friday, Kavanaugh admitted making some 15,000 such harassing calls to women, 
[01:36:30]  asking them questions about their underwear.  He posed as a clothing researcher and claimed to be gathering marketing data for a retailer.  Ah, he had a story.  Good.  He'd been making the calls for 12 years, usually starting off his conversations with seemingly innocuous questions  about the women's socks and cardigans.  Then he would move on to their underwear, making lewd suggestions to his victims.  Just, how do people just not hang up and not bother with it?  Oh, I'm glad he's going to jail.  What a creep. 
[01:37:00]  15,000 calls?  Yeah, he's persistent.  But I mean, it's...  I hope he has a good calling plan.  Your friends, family, and frequently harassed program.  I don't know how...  How...  On average, is your bill a lot more or a lot less than you thought it would be when you signed up for your iPhone?  It's, I believe, a little bit more.  Not a lot, but I don't do that stupid email thing, but it's a little bit more.  Mine seems a lot more.  Yeah, I thought it was AT&T.  A lot more. 
[01:37:30]  Really?  Yeah, I got a plan.  Remember they said, like, there's two plans or something?  One was for something, and then $100 a month for another plan.  So I got that one, figuring that was, like, good.  And I read through everything, and it seemed pretty inclusive.  But every month, I'm getting a phone bill that is over $200.  But why?  I don't know.  These stupid surcharge...  A usage charge?  Dude, the charges on these bills, usage charge, tax on the usage charge, equipment charges, taxes on that, and then there's excise tax, and a tax for a tax tax. 
[01:38:00]  They tax the crap out of everything.  They tax the crap out of tax.  Yes, they're taxing taxes.  How about Elliot Spitzer?  Governor Spitzer does something about that and the way they are raping the public.  Instead of worrying about if a radio guy is going to see Van Halen at the Garden, how about you do that?  Yeah, where he got his tickets from.  Well, you got to explain. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, they really messed up radio, and every ticket has to be accounted for now if you work at a radio station.  That's what Jimmy's...  Because I asked for Foo Fighter tickets.  I wasn't allowed to have Foo Fighter tickets because then Elliot Spitzer's office would be suspicious that some kind of plug-ola thing's going on.  How about Elliot Spitzer and then do something about these disgusting charges these thieves in the phone companies are putting on you?  And they're thieves.  Because we talk about politicians all the time.  That's tough stuff to do. 
[01:39:00]  It's easy to go after the soft subjects and soft topics out there.  That would be pretty intense if you went after the phone companies and said,  what the F are you doing with all these extra charges every month?  Isn't that something that people could kind of get behind?  Of course.  That's not like one of these stupid things that some people get behind, most people don't care about.  That's something that people go, yeah, you know something?  This was cut down on my cell phone bill.  But no, they never go after that.  What is a usage charge? 
[01:39:30]  That's my phone bill.  That's my phone bill.  I'm using the phone.  There.  I pay it.  Oh, they're pigs.  I don't think your cable bill should be up to $200 a month either.  What is that about?  Well, there's no hidden charges in that, I don't think.  Yeah, I haven't seen any.  When I get a huge cable bill, I look and I get all the channels and movies and stuff like that.  I think it's way too expensive.  It's way too expensive.  It's ridiculous.  They pretty much got you by the right there.  But the phone thing is, you read through your phone bill, you have no clue what those charges are. 
[01:40:00]  And there's no explanation for them.  And then I don't even understand why it's so much for the iPhone above what my plan was for.  My plan is for $100.  And it was supposedly unlimited data and a transfer.  And then I'm looking and I'm paying a hell of a lot more.  And I don't understand why.  AT&T.  I hope Apple understands that AT&T has been an abysmal failure as a carrier. 
[01:40:30]  They have been an abomination as far as a carrier.  You understand, you get a photo texted to you, a photo sent to you.  It's like when I had Verizon.  And the way it would work with Verizon is I still couldn't get photos from my BlackBerry.  So I would have to go to the site, but you have an account and you could save all the photos you have in your account.  You sign in and there's the photo.  It's a little inconvenient, but it was doable.  This stupid AT&T, you get a text, it has a different password and code number for every photo you get. 
[01:41:00]  Every time you get a photo.  And it opens in a small window.  You can't save it to anything.  It is despicably bad technology.  You can't look at it full size.  You've got to look at it in this postage stamp little size.  It really is ridiculous.  AT&T is horrendous.  Horrendous carrier.  We've got Greg in Long Island talking about AT&T.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know that when you go into a dealer to sign up for AT&T, 
[01:41:30]  AT&T basically, in one way or another, forces the dealers to put add-ons that you don't know about.  Add-ons such as towing, things like insurance.  Towing?  What?  Hold on, hold on.  Towing.  Wait, did you say towing?  Yes, I did.  Like towing your car if you want to become disabled.  They add stuff like that onto your bill.  I was speaking with a gentleman yesterday. 
[01:42:00]  I am completely lost about the towing thing.  Towing?  What are you talking about?  Is there like a tow hotline for AT&T customers?  Like insurance.  Like AA, AAA, whatever that thing is.  Right.  They have that for your cell phone so that you're insured through AT&T.  Oh, okay.  Oh, like the GPS thing?  Right.  It tells where you are.  They add-on to your bill that you don't normally look at or wouldn't even realize.  A lot of times it's equipment and items code. 
[01:42:30]  So you don't know what this code is and what you're being charged for.  But there's one guy that I was talking to said that he had three separate instances where  people came in and their kids had that insurance on their phone and they were only 12, 13 years  old.  So they weren't even driving yet.  They were paying a monthly fee to have that insurance.  You know what AT&T should put their resources into?  Putting some towers on the west side of Manhattan so calls are not constantly dropped. 
[01:43:00]  How about that?  How about that is where they put their efforts?  A lot of times what happens is people don't want the towers by them.  And they go out and fight the lobby to not have the towers put by their houses.  And usually it's the people that use their phones that are complaining.  Well, how does Verizon Sprint do it?  I don't know.  It's two different types of technologies on how they actually operate.  And what happens is depending on who has the phones where, how many people are congested 
[01:43:30]  in one single area is what's going to determine how many people can talk and how clear it will  be and whether or not you're going to get thrilled.  So if AT&T has too many customers, let's say, on Long Island that their system can't handle it, Verizon may not have as much.  Therefore, their service is going to appear better.  Well, Verizon, here's the thing.  I think they're the biggest.  They have the most everywhere. 
[01:44:00]  They have the best coverage.  And I'm not shilling for Verizon.  I mean, their customer service is as awful as anybody's.  But AT&T service has been such a disgusting disappointment.  All right.  Let's go to Roland in Tennessee.  Roland?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You have this towing thing, this towing charge?  Yeah, I got Sprint service.  And if you run out of gas right now, you just call it.  And they'll come out and give you some gas to get you to the station.  Or they'll come out and tow you to a shop.  Do most people know they have this?  But is it on everyone's bill?  No, I had to select it. 
[01:44:30]  I went to the store and looked at the sheet.  And I wanted a towing package on it.  All right, that guy's claiming they just throw that on without you even knowing about it.  Maybe they do.  And you'll never use the service because you had no clue you had it.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mike in Westchester.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, bro?  How you doing?  Hey.  Dude, listen, I bought the iPhone when it first came out, right?  Yes.  The first billing cycle, I had a $3,100 bill.  Why?  Dude, I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  I had a $3,100 bill.  I started getting all these recalls on the phone and everything else.  I called up AT&T, and I had Tourette's syndrome.  I was cursing everybody out.  Yeah, I got a huge bill when I went to the Bahamas for roaming charges.  I understood it was going to be a little more than usual.  I'd taken phones down there.  I'd had it on roaming, and you pay extra for that.  But it was so ridiculous. 
[01:45:30]  It was something like $1,200 I had to pay in a phone bill, which I've never paid that much in a phone bill.  You said something interesting there.  You knew it would be a little more.  Most people have no idea.  Yeah, you go out of country, and all of a sudden your phone is just on, and it's roaming its ass off.  When it says roaming, it doesn't just mean, hey, I'm just going to roam around.  You stay here.  I'm going to hit the beach and the bars.  Right, right.  You go out.  It's not just roaming.  It's costing you extra money.  They're getting the phone coming.  They're just getting away with murder.  Huh?  I wasn't even out of the country, bro.  Why was it so much? 
[01:46:00]  I don't know.  What happened was I called up, and they said to me I was in roaming.  I drive a truck.  You know, I live and work in Westchester County.  The farthest trip I go to is Dutchess County.  So they turned around and told me I have a $3,100 bill.  Must be one dead area that you're roaming in that you keep going through.  It's just disgusting, man.  They're just thieves.  It's sick.  It's sick.  It's crazy.  And the funny thing about it is I think the president who owns or who works for AT&T got 
[01:46:30]  raped by monks with hoods on their head.  They're raping all the people with phones.  Okay.  I didn't quite get your point about the monks with hoods on their head.  How do you check your bill on the iPhone?  Let's go to Brian in Pennsylvania.  That's a good idea.  Brian, what's up?  Let's check our bills.  Hey.  Hey.  A little bit off subject, but I have a late nomination for a line of the day within the  past hour.  You guys were talking about the birthday and the prince and everything, and you guys blew 
[01:47:00]  right past Anthony's line when he said, I can see if it's a landmark birthday, 21, sweet  16, and then he goes, nine.  Yes, I did.  That's okay.  Oh, no.  Did you just check your bill?  No, no, no, no.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Oh, nothing.  Oh, usage.  Let's see.  Just check the usage.  Oh, Jesus.  Of course.  Well, then how about helping us out?  Wait, what happened?  Exactly.  What happened? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know how to.  Oh, well.  There you go.  Of course.  Matt in California, what's up?  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Hey, I was just calling.  A caller earlier said, talking about insurance on your phone bill and said something about  a 13-year-old that wasn't even driving.  It's not car insurance.  It's insurance on your phone.  If you break it, you call them and they send you a new one.  I know, but you know, I think they send you a used one.  All the phone companies have that and you'll get a refurbished. 
[01:48:00]  That's the word they'll use, refurbished.  Refurbished.  That's used.  It's furbished again.  I've never gotten anything furbished.  I don't know what it means.  I just want it furbished.  Do I have a furbished phone?  No, no.  Don't furbish it again.  How do you furbish something?  I don't know.  All right.  Hey, Tim put this together from earlier.  Anthony Cumia's seminar for a greener planet.  I completely believe in global warming now and we have to do something about this because 
[01:48:30]  we're doomed.  Recycle.  Join Anthony in his fight for a cleaner world.  A second ice age coming if we don't watch out.  Anthony Cumia's seminar for a greener planet.  The ice caps are melting, Opie.  The ice caps.  Ten years, Europe can be frozen.  Armageddon is right around the corner in your lifetime.  Make the world a better tomorrow for your children and your children's children.  I'd say by the day after tomorrow, we're pretty much done.  The Anthony Cumia seminar for a greener planet on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the end of the world. 
[01:49:00]  I was taken out of context.  No, you weren't.  That's what you said.  I was taken out of context.  Some of those words were indeed mine.  No, you're now officially environmentalist.  But for the most, I'm an environmentalist.  Oof, that'll be the day.  It says it right there.  I am not.  It says it right there.  Let's go to CJ in New York.  What's up, CJ?  Yeah, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey.  I got a quick question for you, man.  I listen to you guys every fucking morning.  You guys are hilarious.  Oh, hold on.  You're cursing, sir.  That didn't go out over the radio. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, we want a lot of people to hear what you're saying, so try not to curse too much,  okay?  Not a problem.  All right.  Go ahead, CJ.  I listen to you guys every morning.  You guys are hilarious.  I caught Jimmy Norton's Monster Rain on HBO.  That guy, he just, I mean, I don't know.  He had me falling over, you know?  Thank you.  But everybody's whining and moaning about these cell phone charges, but you get these  people that run around and all they do is talk on their damn cell phone all the time.  We're not, sir, hold on.  We're not complaining about being charged to use the phone.  And this is not just AT&T.  Every company does it.  I had it with Verizon, too. 
[01:50:00]  There's these, and now we talk about hidden charges.  They find reasons just to continually raping you.  They can't just be square with you as a consumer.  Oh, they're anally, they're anally violating you every time you turn around.  They get you coming and they get you coming.  But you need to, you want the service.  It's a convenience factor, you know, because nobody can get their home phone.  Yes, you're right.  Again, I'm not complaining about the service.  What I'm complaining about is when they put on charges like a usage charge and a tax and 
[01:50:30]  this and that and this that you're not supposed to have to pay.  That's my complaint.  They tax you on the tax.  They tax you on your tax that you, that they charge you on your damn phone, you know?  They owe it all the taxes, $11.27.  Well, you got to tax on another $0.70 because $11.27 equals $0.70 in tax.  But it seems to me, Governor Pataki, he don't care about that.  He has no stake in that.  It's the gas prices that he cares about.  Governor Pataki?  Governor Pataki. 
[01:51:00]  CJ, I'm calling from another time?  This is fascinating.  CJ, when are you going to get to the, your, your, you want to say who gives a S gas prices  are worse?  That's right.  Gas prices need to be adjusted.  Yes, they do.  But they're not mutually exclusive.  Yeah, maybe we could just adjust them.  Okay, $10 a barrel.  You can do both of these things.  You don't have to make a decision.  Gas or cell phones, folks, it's up to you.  Why?  Pick and choose.  If you were on a desert island, here it is. 
[01:51:30]  My current balance.  Last payment received, $215.  Current balance, and this, I'm not even closed yet, $200.39.  For what?  This is over $400 for two months of service.  Dude, I don't know.  I don't know.  I have to call and ask questions.  But calling is a pain in the ass, too.  Any type of customer service you got to deal with.  They got it all figured out.  You have to call to find out the answers, but we all know that's just a nightmare. 
[01:52:00]  No one calls.  So just continue.  You know that I still pay for AOL.  I haven't checked it in two to three years.  Because I know it's going to be a pain in the ass.  That's what I did.  To call them and just cancel the dumb thing.  Dude, seven years.  Seven years I had AOL, and I never used it.  Two accounts.  Just boom, boom, every month, every month.  And then finally, I'm going through my bill.  I said, you know what?  I'm going to call them and cancel.  It took hours to cancel.  And I got one of those guys that just wouldn't let you cancel.  Well, look.  We'll leave you signed up. 
[01:52:30]  We'll cancel the account.  But you still have like six months free.  And I go, no.  I don't.  Just cancel it.  Completely cancel it right now.  You do understand we have these offers that.  Holy Jesus.  Just cancel the goddamn service.  I joined a gym recently, a new gym.  And they're going to take, you know, my fee out monthly from my credit card.  And I'm like, oh, you're doing that because you're going to get so many people that are  going to like pay for two, three, four, five a year before they go, wait a minute.  I'm still paying for the gym membership and I don't go there anymore. 
[01:53:00]  And then they finally cancel.  I'm like, this is a wonderful revenue stream for you guys.  You know, if you take money out of someone's credit card month after month, that you're  going to get a lot of people that aren't going to be paying too much attention.  They're going to be paying for something they're not using anymore.  He goes, yeah, you're absolutely right.  But, you know, it's corporate policy.  And what can I tell you?  I just work here.  But you know what?  Between me and you, you're absolutely right.  That's why they do these things.  They figured out little revenues, you know, streams.  They know the percentage of people, they probably do their research, that will not cancel a service 
[01:53:30]  right away and will allow a company to continue taking out charges from their credit card before  they finally wake up and go, wait a minute here.  Yeah.  Just a scale.  Because they try to make it sound like it's easier for you that we just take your fee out  monthly.  Yes there, Jimmy.  Current balance.  Hold on.  $169.73.  And I'm supposed to have the $100 plan too, right? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  So where is this extra money going from?  Shouldn't a $100 plan be $100?  I hate that crap.  Like any time I sign up for a phone and I have like a plan, you know, whether it was $39,  $49, $59, whatever it is, that was my bill.  So I really never went over anything.  And I always signed up for whatever I could unlimited, whether it's data transfer or whatever.  Yeah.  And I'm noticing that I'm paying twice what I'm supposed to be paying at least. 
[01:54:30]  Is it $100?  Now this is, I saw a $40 thing too.  Is it $100 for unlimited phone and then $40 for additional unlimited data?  Maybe that's the thing, like with texting.  I don't know.  I want somebody who knows this.  Gotta read your contract.  Can someone print out a contract?  Read your contract.  Can someone print out an AT&T contract?  Where is it?  Good luck.  Good luck.  Another one.  Exactly.  I went and got a camera recently and they had a special or whatever and they said, I don't  know, I don't remember exactly, but just follow me. 
[01:55:00]  You'll understand it was like, let's say $499.  I'm like, Ooh, $499.  Perfect.  Plus tax, a warranty.  Then we got this guard thing and then we do this and then we get, you know, for an extra  20 bucks, we'll give you this and this.  And then, and all of a sudden they just threw so many charges at me.  I'm like that, that camera that's, that is like advertised 499.  I'm walking out like $700.  I'm like, what happened to the $499?  Doesn't exist.  Doesn't exist.  I would love a company to go, look, here it is. 
[01:55:30]  This camera right here is going to cost you exactly this.  We ain't going to mess with you, but first of all, make it prices, uh, prices $499 because  $499 sounds like you're paying, you know, in the 400s for a camera.  No, it's $500.  It's 500 bucks.  But it looks better to see, it looks better to see four instead of five when you're trying  to save a little money.  They do that to you every time.  And, and I never take any of the, uh, warranty, extended warranty thing.  That's betting.  You're placing a bet that what you just bought is going to break. 
[01:56:00]  You're hoping it breaks so you, uh, can get, uh, your dollars worth out of that plan.  And I think they'll give you a refurbished one anyway.  They won't give you a new one.  All right.  Refurbished.  I'd like one that has been furbished again, please.  Furbished.  Here you are.  Uh, can you, uh.  What is to furb something?  I don't know.  This is furbished.  Can you move that out of the way?  Thank you, E-Rock.  Jesus Christ.  Why would you put up the iPhone terms and conditions and then like decide you need to  instant message someone over the thing? 
[01:56:30]  Because he's E-Rock.  Just move it to the side and then you can, you can do both things at one time.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, cell phone company, uh, it poses monthly regulatory cost recovery charge of up to 125  to help defray costs incurred in complying with state and federal telecom regulations,  state and federal universal service charges, and surcharges for customer-based and revenue-based  state and local assessments on AT&T.  Uh, these are not taxes or government-required charges.  International messages not included.  Charges for international messages sent from the U.S. are 25 cents for text messages and 
[01:57:00]  50 cents for picture-slash-video messages.  Additional charges for premium messages and content apply.  Messages over 300 KBs billed and additional 50 cents per message.  Terms applicable.  Thank you for clearing that up.  You jumped over something.  Well, I said not, these are not government charges or taxes.  Yeah.  So, what exactly are they?  Well, this is how they get you.  Like, this is like trying to, like, read a foreign language.  Terms applicable to nation, family, talks, GSM plans, credit approval required. 
[01:57:30]  Subscribers must live and have a mailing address within AT&T's own network coverage area.  An early termination fee of $175 applies if service is terminated before the end of the  contract term.  Oh.  If phone is returned within three days, activation fee will be refunded.  If phone is returned within 14 days in like new condition with all components, early termination  fee will be waived.  Service may be canceled after 14 days, but within 30 days, an early termination fee will  be waived, but equipment may not be returned.  All other charges apply. 
[01:58:00]  Some dealers impose additional fees.  Minute increment billing and usage.  Airtime and other measured usage are billed in full minute increments, and actual airtime and  usage are rounded up to the next full increment at the end of each call for billing purposes.  Phone company charges a full minute increment of usage for every fraction of the last minute  used on each wireless call.  I mean, some of this you pick up, but most of this is like your brain starts to explode.  Minutes will be depleted according to usage in the following order.  Night and weekend minutes, mobile to mobile minutes, anytime minutes, and rollover minutes. 
[01:58:30]  Calls placed on networks served by other carriers may take longer to be processed, and billing  for these calls may be delayed.  Those minutes will be applied again against your anytime months and minutes in the month  in which the calls appear on your bill.  Unanswered outgoing calls for 30 seconds or longer incur airtime.  You may obtain usage information by calling customer service or using one of our automated  systems.  Pricing, taxes, no proration.  Final month's charges are not prorated.  But why is my bill $200? 
[01:59:00]  I'm getting to it.  Prices are subject to change.  Prices do not include taxes.  Activation fees, $36 activation fee for each new line, $26 activation fee applies on each  additional family talk line.  Nights and weekends, nights are 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Weekends are 9 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday based on time of day at Switch providing your  service, including long-distance calls can be made from the 50...  Oh my God, I have to go all the way down to here?  This is like 20 pages!  Distance calls can be made from the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin 
[01:59:30]  Islands to the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Northern Mariana  Islands.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  Roaming charges do not apply when roaming within the service area of land-based networks  of the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.  International long-distance brings vary.  Additional charges apply to services used outside the land areas of the U.S., Puerto Rico,  and U.S. Virgin Islands.  Unlimited voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between two individuals.  Unlimited voice services may not be used for conferencing, calling, call forwarding, 
[02:00:00]  monitoring services, data transmissions, transmissions of broadcasts, transmission of recorded material,  or other connections which do not consist of uninterrupted live dialogue between two  individuals.  If A&T finds that you are using an unlimited voice service offering for other than live  dialogue between two individuals, the phone company may, at its option, terminate your  service or charge your plan to one with no unlimited use in comments.  Phone company will provide notice that it intends to take any of the above actions and you 
[02:00:30]  may terminate the agreement.  International roaming.  Substantial charges may be incurred if phone is taken out of the U.S.  Even if both carriers are intentionally used, off-net usage, and your minutes of news  including unlimited services on other carrier networks, off-net usage, during any two consecutive  months exceed your off-net usage allowance.  Shut up.  Phone company may, at its option, terminate your service.  Shut up.  Deny your continued use of other carrier covers, or change your plan to one imposing usage  charge for off-net usage. 
[02:01:00]  Game over, man.  Game over.  Your off-net usage allowance is equal to the lesser of 750 minutes of 5% of the anytime minutes  included with your plan.  Phone company will provide notice if it intends to take any of the above actions, and you  may terminate the agreement.  Oh, caller ID blocking.  Your billing name may be displayed along with your wireless numbers on help out calls to other  wires on a landline phone with caller ID capability.  Bueller.  Bueller.  Capability.  Bueller.  Contact customer service room information.  I'm blocking the display of your name.  You may be charged for both an incoming and an outgoing call when incoming calls. 
[02:01:30]  Can you dig that?  I'm routed to voicemail even if no message is left.  See wireless service agreement for additional conditions and restrictions.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Family talk.  Who the F, dude?  No, no, no.  This is him.  Okay.  He rocks.  We didn't even get into rollover minutes, mobile to mobile minutes, term application to 
[02:02:00]  features, voice dials, wireless data service terms and conditions, general terms and conditions  applicable to the phone company, data service, including but not limited features that may  be used with data service and wireless content.  I just wanted to know why.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Look at how long this thing is.  They do this on purpose.  Look at, yes, that's what I'm getting at.  No one's going to read it.  Eh, who cares?  They know that, to me, if you unravel this, you can probably have charges knocked off,  but they know that you're not going to because it's only a few bucks a month. 
[02:02:30]  But do that, you know, times five million customers and you make a lot of money.  I'm just going to have to call and ask, wait, wait, wait, wait, go to the top of this.  I know there's a visual, but maybe we'll try to, I mean, okay, all the way to the top.  Okay.  We're on the internet.  Watch this scroll by.  Who the F is going to read this and understand like a part of that teeny tiny text?  It's keep going.  Still scrolling.  E-Rock's been scrolling the whole time.  Still scrolling.  Yep.  It's like a mortgage.  Scrolling.  Yeah.  It would have, honestly, it would probably take me a minimum of a half hour to read this 
[02:03:00]  whole thing at fast speed on the radio.  A minimum.  Should we have-  Probably longer.  A word count?  Do you know where you can put that in a word document?  I'd love to see how many words that contract is.  Well, look at the bottom of this thing.  Pulled.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go to the bottom.  Go to the bottom again.  A little further up.  I just saw something.  Pulled Data Connect Plans.  Hmm.  That might be it.  And then they talk about additional kilobyte charge. 
[02:03:30]  Ah.  See, that's the problem.  Additional kilobyte charge.  Do you know what a CRU is?  Yeah, I do.  That's right.  What's a CRU?  It's married to one.  I don't know, but I know what that first word is.  All right.  There you go.  A foundation account.  Do you know what a foundation account is?  Sure.  You do?  What is it, Jimmy?  That's when the foundation decides that they need to make calls, they get an account.  Yeah.  All right.  Of course, the account upon which other accounts are built.  Well, let's not forget, guys. 
[02:04:00]  CRU-  Go to this down here.  Upon which?  Don't forget, too, by the way.  CRUs on pool plans and CRUs participating in a legacy pool data connect plan pool created  prior to February 17, 2006 legacy pool cannot be in the same pool, but can be within the  same fan.  It has to do with pools.  End users on non-pooling plans may be included in the same fan as CRUs on pool plans.  However, these non-pooling end users will not receive the pooling benefits or contribute 
[02:04:30]  included usage to a pool.  I don't know what that even means.  I rest my case, judge.  People are asking, is the pool heated?  6,707 words.  How many pages does that come out to?  11.  11 pages?  6,000 word contract.  And you're supposed to sit there at the phone store while you're waiting to get a phone  to read that first.  Wait a minute.  Can I have my lawyer go over this paragraph with you? 
[02:05:00]  I want to know, and Ope, you read this, and the first-  I did?  I don't even know what I read.  I don't think this is exclusive to AT&T.  It's the one thing here.  AT&T, and again, this may be Verizon and all of them, also imposes a monthly regulatory  cost recovery charge up to $1.25 to help defray.  What does defray mean exactly?  It's like defer, only fraying.  Defray means recapture costs incurred in complying with state and federal telecom regulations,  state and federal universal service charges, and surcharge for customer-based and revenue-based 
[02:05:30]  state and local assessments onto AT&T.  So in other words, it's like, we have to pay this, but we don't want to, so you're  paying it.  That's pretty much what that means.  I would love to do that.  Look, I'm going to have to charge you more, because I got bills to pay.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We weren't real late.  We should talk about contracts in general after the break.  They've got to make contracts easy, so we can start meeting again, instead of just sign  here, sign here, sign here, sign here. 
[02:06:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, this is Adam Ferrara.  Where am I going to be?  Well, I will tell you.  November 14th through the 18th, that will be at Hilarities in Cleveland, Ohio.  For tickets, call 216-736-4242.  4-2-2-1-6-736-4242.  When you look into your eyes, I can see how much I love you, and it makes me feel like 
[02:06:30]  Hey, it's Rob Bartlett.  December 15th.  Rob Bartlett, back at the brokerage, Belmore, Long Island.  The big, fat Christmas show.  The Brokerage, Merrick Road, Belmore, 1-516-781-LAFF.  And that's L-A-F-F.  Because you know why?  It's wacky to spell it that way.  And of course, you know, the one is only if you're outside the 516 area, you're coming  in from Suffolk or, you know, from Jersey, because you have nothing else better to do on  December 15th.  The big, fat Christmas show at the brokerage. 
[02:07:00]  Call Opie and Anthony.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Cell phone and PDA users, send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com.  Call Opie and Anthony.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[02:07:30]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Something big.  Kind of like that log you left for your girlfriend to find.  Ah, getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Did you learn anything today?  You never learn anything.  Did ya?  Yeah, they learned my whole thing on Earth. 
[02:08:00]  Ooh.  Right?  I learned that somehow my words got twisted around to turning me into an environmentalist.  Yeah, we learned today that Anthony is now an environmentalist.  I don't believe in global warming.  I explained why, like, the seasons are changing.  It's called my...  Theory.  It's where it twists and tips over.  Yeah.  Did we do any ringtones today?  That's the only thing we didn't do on the show today. 
[02:08:30]  We got a lot done, but...  I think you could probably cull some ringtones.  Yeah?  Ding.  Just from the audio of the show.  Okay.  I think there was enough funny little lines that could be used as ringtones.  We need the sound for tomorrow.  We got this $1,000 a day contest.  We play a sound between 7 and 7.30.  And if you're the 10th caller after you hear the sound, you win $1,000.  Just for listening to Opie and Anthony.  So easy.  I got tomorrow sound.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  You ready for this one?  Please.  This is what you're listening for for tomorrow.  Okay.  What?  I just got to put my headphones on.  Oh.  Well, Negro.  Where the hell is that from?  That's from that old school...  My baby is black.  All right.  Negro.  Is that going to be too short?  Is it?  Because if it's too short, then we could use...  My baby is...  Well, we don't want to confuse people.  Is that too short?  I don't think it's too short.  Let's try the other one, though.  The Negro.  That's perfect.  That's not too short. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  What do you think?  We can't change it now.  Sure we can.  It's in the rules.  It's in the contest rules.  Did the rules ever say we had to do it the day before and say it only once?  No.  We can sort it out.  Yeah.  We're sorting it out.  Well, let's go with this.  Tomorrow between 7 and 7.30, we'll be playing this.  The Negro.  That will be your cue to call and be the 10th caller.  If you are, you'll win $1,000.  By the way, all these sounds are on onaradio.com, just in case maybe you can't linger longer 
[02:10:00]  and you don't pick up on the sound.  You can just go over to onaradio.com.  It's listed pretty much right there on the top.  Top left, I believe.  All right.  Goody good.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show today.  It's Gary in Missouri.  What's up, Gary?  Not much.  I learned today that Jimmy lived with Mommy and Daddy until he was 30 years old.  Yep.  I know, dude.  It's awful.  That's what I deserve.  30.  Is that worse than me? 
[02:10:30]  I moved out at 18, came back at 28, and then had to live with Mom and Daddy after being out of the house for 10 years.  Nah.  Is that worse?  What you dealt with might be more frustrating, but no, what's worse is at least you had 10 years  and hit a rough spot and then came back and left again.  I had, from the time I was 18, 12 more.  I used to get hookers.  I would put up the sun visor in my parents' driveway so my mother couldn't look out the window and see her son humiliate himself. 
[02:11:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're in the middle of What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show, and I just learned a...  Oh, yeah, I'm going to say it.  A doozy!  You got prostitutes in the driveway?  Many times.  And I had a visor.  What a safe place.  The sun visor that keeps the sun from heating up your car.  I would pop that up.  The big ridiculous one?  Yeah, the big pieces of tinfoil or whatever you put in your...  Oh, those things.  Yeah, those things.  What do they call it?  Sun blockers.  Yeah, yeah.  You put them in your car and you go to the beach so that they keep the sun from beating down onto your seat. 
[02:11:30]  So I would put that up in the front so if you walked by the car, you couldn't look in the window and see anything.  You're awful.  Do we have Jimmy's mom's phone call?  We haven't played that in a while.  It might be a great way to end today.  Did they have any idea?  Dad had to know.  No, they were in bed.  I just didn't...  I'd park in the driveway and have it one day.  Why would you park in the driveway?  Safe.  I can't buy my own driveway.  Yeah, that's true.  The sun guys are up.  That's a great place to go.  Did you ever see a light come on or...  I don't remember.  I don't think so. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you think they knew it was going on?  I don't know.  Any point?  I'm not sure.  When they'd walk in and maybe the front of my pants would smell like drugs.  They assumed that somebody had drugs.  Yeah, it could have been a problem.  Cane's dribble.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Good afternoon, Cleveland, by the way.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hello, boys.  I learned that Anthony's going to convert his house to solar power.  It didn't get longer.  I am not.  Let's go to Polk. 
[02:12:30]  Is it Polk in Connecticut?  What's up, Polk?  That's right, gentlemen.  Good morning.  How are you?  Today, I learned that blind people are way more dumber than humans.  Linger longer.  Linger longer.  Jesus.  All right.  Hey, we got...  Can we play your mom's voicemail?  It's been a while, Jimmy.  If we have time as we're walking out, yeah.  Well, I don't have to listen to it.  You don't like listening to it?  Oh, I don't mind.  I've just...  But you took her advice.  You found a nice girl.  You hit the gym.  You settled down.  Why don't you settle down? 
[02:13:00]  It's all the things she said in this voicemail, if you think about it.  I mean, it did.  So it's nice to look back.  That is true.  To reflect, as we say, I did settle down.  I did meet a nice girl.  Jimmy's...  That's nice.  Jimmy's mom listens to the show.  Are you all right with this?  I don't want to do this.  Oh, yeah.  You're not all right with this.  Fine, of course.  Okay.  And she was kind of bothered with some of the things Jimmy was discussing on the show,  including his life with prostitutes.  And, well, she left this very, very awkward voicemail on Jimmy's machine there. 
[02:13:30]  And I actually put it as the final track on my second CD.  Oh, that's right.  So everyone can hear Mother.  Mother.  Her lovely little voice.  Mother.  Here it is.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something. 
[02:14:00]  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling. 
[02:14:30]  So don't get offended or think I'm straight.  Strange, but I am a mother.  And I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you.  And I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  And I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie? 
[02:15:00]  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  That's my favorite part.  Don't be mad at me.  Jimmy just comes and goes over there.  Why did you say this?  You know, I want to be mad.  Start punching her.  Did she read your book?  I don't know.  I never asked and I don't want to know.  Hope not.  Wow.  Of course you read it.  They did.  Sure they did.  Of course you read it, Jimmy.  Oh, I thought there was something going on over there, no?  Okay.  All right, guys.  That's where we'll leave today's show. 
[02:15:30]  Yar.  Hope you had a good time.  We did.  Yar.  We're going to go over to another joint now.  And the festivities continue.  We're going to go curse.  And if you're not joining us, well, you know, have a good day.  And love one another.  As you would have.  Ah, screw it.  And don't forget that Anthony is now an environmentalist. 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  Congratulations for going green, eh?  I'm going green.  Congratulations.  See you tomorrow.  All right, man.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Ryder.  Hey there, father muckers. 
[02:16:30]  Wah, wah, wah.  That's better.  Here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  The future of radio.  The future.  Right?  It entails rocketry.  And man-made objects in orbit.  In outer space.  Space.  Space.  Yes.  It's truly the future. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Oh, yeah.  I was feeling it.  Had an uncomfortable look from Tom on the way out.  Ah, it's all right.  We didn't know.  In the end, we didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for everything.  All right.  What are we doing over here today?  Well, somebody brought up Atlantic City. 
[02:17:30]  No, we didn't.  They did.  The Borgata.  I hear there's going to be a very funny comic.  How long are you going to talk about that?  There.  Who cares?  January 18th and 19th?  It's irrelevant.  My Borgata shows mean nothing.  Forget them.  All right, good.  Just forget them.  But Martin Luther King's birthday, I wanted to discuss.  That happens to be the weekend.  I'm going to be there.  Oh.  I think it's important that we discuss the great Dr. King.  Yes.  Happy birthday.  Today?  No, no.  In January.  In January, of course. 
[02:18:00]  No, not today.  When he's going to be there.  January 18th and 19th.  That's his weekend.  I think it's the Monday that's his birthday.  Yeah.  But they celebrate.  But everyone takes Monday off.  As a matter of fact, I think the only named person we get a holiday off for now is Martin  Luther King.  Lincoln's birthday, Washington's birthday became President's Day.  Yeah.  I believe the only person's name that's a day off is Martin Luther King.  Hmm.  Really?  I believe so, yeah.  Very interesting.  I think so, too.  It's amazing how the tides have changed.  So, uh...  It's amazing.  We're trying to do fart trivia this coming Friday? 
[02:18:30]  Yes, but we cannot say fart trivia on CBS, so we have to go some other way to say it.  Yeah.  For some reason, they don't want us to say fart trivia, so it's going to be called what?  Cunt lip.  It's so weird how they're settled on that.  Can I have some water, please?  Are you parched?  Yeah, I just want water.  All right, let's get Jimmy some water.  So, how do we get the people for the fart trivia, fan?  How do we get them?  Yeah.  If they're interested, they can email...  Oh, boy. 
[02:19:00]  The mic isn't on.  Do we have a prize?  I don't have that.  They're working on...  Where's Steve?  I hope they have a prize.  Let's see what the prize is.  We had some stuff lying around the prize closet, which...  Where's Steve?  Here he is.  Where's Steve?  Wow, this list is getting shorter every day, huh?  Which one's that?  This used to be two or three pages.  Oh.  The O&A commercial radio station list.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 19, 19, 20, 19, 20, 20, 21, 20, 20, 20, 20. 
[02:19:30]  It's still pretty impressive.  Just under 20 stations still.  Where's Steve?  I don't know.  He's probably scrolling.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll 
[02:20:00]  certificate for $100 or $150  and then a whole bunch of  stuff that's in the prize closet  over at the other place. Which is what?  Which is what? The best of Christopher  Walken on Saturday Night Live.  So basically we got a $150  gift certificate. Yeah.  To get them. Is that it, Steve?  Yeah, as far as  the prizes without going to 
[02:20:30]  a sponsor? Alright.  So why don't we just say we have no prizes?  $150? I'll  cough that up. Yeah. Not for this.  But for other things.  $150 prize  we have. Ooh. Wow.  Hmm. Line up, folks.  I think we're going to need some more  initiative. Yeah.  More incentive, I mean, to have these  people show up  for fart trivia.  Or we'll just cancel the contest and give a shit.  No, but I wanted to do it. 
[02:21:00]  It sounds fun. I want it to be called  fart trivia. Simple as that.  What is it now called?  Fart by any other name.  I think that's funny though.  It would still smell like fucking  hot garbage and sizzling.  Thank you.  See, I was trying to make a point  that it really doesn't matter  what the name of the  contest is.  I agree.  If we call it something ridiculous,  I like the noise  because it's so stupid  and it's so obvious  that we can't say the word.  All right.  Can we get promos together 
[02:21:30]  for trivia?  Of course.  We're not working on that right now.  Can we...  Because to change the wording of it,  because they won't let us say fart trivia,  to change the wording of it  wouldn't make sense  because then it sounds like  you're trying to tap dance  around fart,  which is what you're trying to do.  And it's just like,  it's going to be too cute.  You know, the gas.  I know.  It's going to sound like  we came up with  a wacky name for it  when we just want it to be  straightforward.  Yeah.  Fart trivia.  Says it all.  I think we need better prizes,  though, to be honest.  I think we're going to get people in. 
[02:22:00]  We need more than $150 gift certificate.  Is the problem  that no one wants to sponsor this?  Is that what we're getting?  No, it was really just the...  They wanted to focus  on the other big things  we have going on in December.  And...  What?  Like what?  Homeless shopping spree.  What?  We can't do that in drive time.  What?  They wanted to focus  their energy on those.  And...  Those...  What you said was a that.  Yeah, and they're not  focusing energy on that.  It was a that.  You said the homeless shopping spree.  And eggnog. 
[02:22:30]  What did I say?  I just heard homeless.  Yeah, homeless shopping spree  and eggnog  were the two other ones  they wanted to focus  their energy on  so they didn't have to...  So what do we have  prizes for that?  We were waiting...  We have cash prizes  and other vacations, I think.  You don't have any vacations  left to sell.  Okay, well, what about...  What do we have  for the eggnog thing?  What vacations to wear?  I think one of the...  One of the prizes  for eggnog  is a Colorado vacation  if I'm not mistaken.  I'm surprised I didn't have  something to do  with one of the affiliates.  A flight to Cleveland 
[02:23:00]  or a bus ride to Boston.  A flight to Cleveland  on Christmas Eve.  Yeah, that's what you want.  You get a fucking...  A ride down to fucking DC  but only between 10 and 1  in the afternoon.  On the Ocella.  All right, well,  what are we doing?  Home of Shopping Spree.  What are we doing  an eggnog drinking contest?  Let's set some dates right now.  Get the planner out.  Let's go.  I thought we had dates already.  And do we have a venue  for eggnog drinking?  We're doing it out  for the people this year. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, I think we almost  have a date, a venue.  Hard Rock?  Yeah, I think so.  It was going to be that...  Is that the only venue  in New York City?  No, they looked in the...  We love them, trust me.  We love them.  We adore them.  It would be nice to just  maybe do something  a little different  every once in a while.  Are we doing it in the morning now?  Yeah, we are doing it in the morning.  Why?  Is it going to be harder  to get people there  in the morning?  No.  Not for eggnog drinking challenge.  Eggnog, I'm sorry.  No, these fuckers  are going to come out  of the woodwork  to see the eggnog drinking contest live.  I was thinking about  the homeless shop.  No, homeless is...  That's a whole other...  No, because of what? 
[02:24:00]  We can only get 500,  600 people at the Hard Rock?  We'll fill that up  nice and early.  We did...  When we broadcast live  in Philly at that venue,  they were lined up  around the freaking corner  at 4.30 in the morning,  5 o'clock in the morning.  So we'll be fine.  That's easy.  Homeless shopping spree  we're going to do  on a Saturday?  On a Saturday.  Like we did last year?  Mm-hmm.  Do we have a date for that?  We're looking at  December 15th.  December 15th,  homeless shopping spree.  All right.  We got to start talking  to the homeless guys.  And eggnog drinking contest  is usually like 
[02:24:30]  right after freaking  Thanksgiving, so...  It's...  We're looking at the  7th, I think.  It's a Friday.  Yes.  November 7th?  December 7th.  I mean, December 7th?  Yeah.  That's right, man.  Obviously.  What is that for?  Eggnog.  Eggnog?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Great.  Just trying to figure it out.  Why?  Don't know.  I'm just wondering.  All right.  All right.  And we'll start promoting it.  So we got to start getting people  that want in on  the eggnog drinking contest.  Is Pat from Minaki  showing up again this year? 
[02:25:00]  Yes, he is.  The current champion?  What else does he  really have to do?  It's his day, really.  It's Pat Minaki day.  It's not cleaning.  We want some real  competitors this year.  Are we getting  a dude from Nathan's  that won this year?  Remember he wanted in?  Joey Chestnut?  That's the thing.  Is he part of that  IFOC thing?  Skull, skull, skull, skull.  Skull, skull, skull.  Skull, skull, skull.  Skull, skull, skull, skull.  I am actually getting  Skull, skull, skull, skull.  It's not a nervous reaction.  Maybe I have an email  from Joey.  What a coincidence  this would be.  Skull, skull, skull.  All right.  Skull, skull, skull, skull, 
[02:25:30]  That's that competitive eating organization  that wants money if we bring them into it.  What?  Yeah, I told you this months ago.  How much do they want?  You know what?  I'm starting my money.  $150 gift certificate.  Exactly.  If you involve any of those competitive eaters.  Tell them, don't they want the marketing?  Joey Chestnut,  there would be great exposure  for their dumb eating organization.  So when they're having their matzo ball eating contest, 
[02:26:00]  somebody will give a shit.  I'll ask them.  I still wouldn't give a shit, I bet.  Yeah, but they have all these eating competitions.  The one everyone knows is the hot dog,  but they eat everything.  Right.  They eat what they have.  Well, they should eat some crow.  That'll show them.  Ladies and gentlemen.  You told them.  A piece of humble pie, perhaps.  Ladies and gentlemen,  their foot,  the current eggnog drinking champion.  Hi, guys. 
[02:26:30]  Paffermanaki.  Pat.  Hello, people.  Oh, hi, Pat.  Will you be defending your title this year?  I wouldn't miss it for the world.  We haven't seen you in a while, Pat.  Yeah, I've been kind of busy.  Really?  In my pit of despair.  What's the matter?  Oh, nothing.  Nah, just nothing.  Uh-oh, what's the problem?  All right, Pat.  Come on, Pat.  What's up? 
[02:27:00]  Nah, nah, it works.  It works, but my vehicle kind of sucks.  Oh, no.  Still or again?  Still.  No, well, actually, the van I had that was taken away, the new van I had, well, the recently  purchased, as I like to call it, is a bigger money pit than the old one, so I'm just kind  of, the more deliveries I do, the more it costs to keep it running.  And he runs a delivery company, so he needs that. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  And then he doesn't really...  I'm getting by.  I just...  I'm getting by.  Things will be all right.  We want you to do better than get by, though.  Pat.  Keep a good spirit.  Why don't we get you into, like, a real moving company or something that will give you a real  nice van or...  You ever think of working for someone else, working for the man?  Ooh.  No, huh?  I kind of like my freedom.  I'm an independent contractor.  Yeah, but how do you get your calls?  On my...  I got a Nextel radio. 
[02:28:00]  They just call.  I let them know I'm available, and then they...  And then we got some work for you.  And how many hours a week do you work there, Pat?  I put in a good eight-hour day.  When I'm, like, listening to the show, and I'm lingering longer in the morning, I'll work  later at night.  I picked up at the Hard Rock last Friday night, like, 10 o'clock at night.  There was something that had to come back to Jersey.  They're doing some kind of event, and I had to pick up, like, lighting equipment. 
[02:28:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  All right, so you're in.  Eggnog Drinking Challenge is going down.  You're in.  December 7th, which is a Friday.  Eggnog.  Oh, God.  I think we're talking, what, four weeks away at this point.  I'm in shrink.  Oh, and my eating organization?  Yeah.  They stink.  Wow.  They had a tournament that they have, and they usually have the top people, and they  build it as having the top 16 eaters. 
[02:29:00]  And I'm ranked 16th.  And they skipped right over me.  Why?  Because I'm being discriminated against.  Because I'm fat.  I'm like the last fat guy in the organization.  Oh, they're trying to show that these are thin guys and athletes now.  They're trying to show that they're athletes.  Stop it.  Yeah, they said it was something that was aired on Spike.  And then they said, oh, we tried to get you in, but it was all Spike.  And then the next event they had that was an invitational, they did the same thing.  Well, how is it all Spike?  Mike, if they're the eating organization, how does Spike TV make... 
[02:29:30]  Because the producers and whatnot, they approve the...  That's their story.  But I ain't buying it.  Well, then who's discriminating against you?  People at Spike because they want fucking athletes?  Yeah, people who look like athletes anyway.  Maybe they didn't rank 16th, and they billed it as the top 16 eaters in the world.  Pat, maybe they just didn't notice.  I'm sure it wasn't 15.  It's more of a round number. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, what is the top 16?  Why 16?  What do they have to game by, like, making sure you're not in on that?  Maybe it was just...  Because they're trying to get characters.  You're the biggest character.  He's fat.  You do that fat waddle when they call your name at the, you know, the Nathan.  You could be the goofy guy.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we get somebody from the eating organization on the phone, Pat?  I would like to straighten this out.  Of course.  Me too.  Well, can you call one of these people?  Uh, sure. 
[02:30:30]  Well said.  Hey, Pat, you want to drink, like, sugar-free eggnog this year so we don't risk you losing a toe?  I got nine left.  Still has nine.  I got bare toes.  How many eggnog challenges have we done?  All right, Pat, hold on the line for a second.  As a trooper.  He knows how to puke it up.  Pat's in.  He will be defending his title this year.  It looks like December 7th is the official date.  Tony in Philly, what's up?  What's up?  I was wondering when that contest was starting, so I want to sign up.  Uh, December 7th. 
[02:31:00]  You think, uh, you can handle it?  Uh, I've been practicing, actually.  I did 60 shots the other night.  Everyone's so cocky.  Did you really do 60?  Yeah, I've been practicing.  Yeah, 60.  Wow.  It's double shots, right?  Double shots.  Double shots.  Yep, so they can't.  It was 30 regular shots, so it's 60.  But that was just the first night of messing around, so.  So what?  You just sat around with your friends and said, I gotta try this?  Well, they did Jager bombs.  You did 60 Jager bombs?  Stop.  No, no, no, no.  They just did regular Jager bombs.  Like, just hanging out.  Oh, they were hanging out watching you just do double shots eggnog every minute? 
[02:31:30]  Yep, sitting around watching Fargo.  We were bored.  Okay.  What's wrong with that?  Should we get, should this guy just be in?  Uh, yeah.  You know, Tony, are you serious?  You really did 60?  Yeah.  All right, you know what?  You're in.  It was that easy for you.  It's not gonna be that easy for everybody else.  But Tony Affili, hold on to the line.  You are a contestant in the eggnog drinking challenge this year.  All right?  Sounds good.  All right, hold on to the line. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, Pat.  Pat.  Pat died.  Pat.  Oh, boy.  Pat died.  Pat.  Yeah, he's dead.  Yo, Pat.  All right, he's gone.  He was dead.  I can pay my phone bill.  Let's go to Matt in Queens.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, um, hey, guys.  I went to Jimmy and Bill Burr's shows this weekend.  Yeah.  So, first of all, it was off the weekend, two free shows, but both of them killed, especially  Jimmy.  Thank you.  And I want to say to you guys, it's really cool that both Jimmy and Oak can be down to earth 
[02:32:30]  and, you know, talk to normal people.  And then the guys are real fancy people.  Oh.  So, it's great to know that you can walk right up to you guys.  Yeah, don't let others know that, though.  I want to keep that between you.  Yes, I have a reputation as a gentleman.  Yeah.  A fancy gentleman.  Oh, well, you were a fancy gentleman the other night.  Thanks for coming, man.  I appreciate it.  It was a great show.  That MySpace show was very fun to Caroline.  Yeah, there was...  Thank you, man.  There was a gentleman who had gone down and seen Jimmy's show on Friday and said he met 
[02:33:00]  Opie there and Jimmy.  And then he just happened to be walking through the bar that I was in and turned his head and  went, holy shit.  Oh, wow.  It was Anthony.  Could you sign this?  When he looked down at the floor, he's like, happy to see you there.  Close.  No, he's a little too early for that.  And I saw someone being escorted out.  And I said, holy shit.  Was the drinking a good one on Saturday?  That was Friday.  I mean, Friday, was it good?  Yeah.  Fuck, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Guinness and Jägermeister.  Breakfast of fucking champions, my friend.  Yeah?  Than was there for a little bit.  How'd you do, Than?  Oh, good.  Wasn't that good?  Well, I stopped at two because I had a radio show the next day.  Ah, that's true.  And you were being responsible.  That was true.  He said he had a radio show to do.  How did that work out?  The big Than, Sam, High Society radio off.  Oh, we pwned.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  And this was determined? 
[02:34:00]  Between me and Sam.  I thought so.  You guys did good?  Yeah.  How'd they do?  Just stunk up the joint?  Yeah, you know, they tried hard.  Really hard.  In for effort.  Was it good or no?  I don't know.  I went to bed.  They came on after us.  Well, did you hear any of the Bronx Johnny and who's the other guy?  Pepper Show?  Yeah.  Sam, did you hear any of that?  Well, I heard like the first hour because I was driving home.  Mm-hmm.  And they spent a lot of time talking about us naturally.  Did they?  They didn't have. 
[02:34:30]  And I guess I read the message boards and the highlight of their show was that Jay Moore  called in.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jay called in?  So they had a celebrity.  Who was your big celebrity?  We don't need celebrities.  We are the celebrities.  That's what some would say if they felt slighted.  You guys are celebrities.  Yeah.  You're celebrities in your own right.  They had Jay Moore.  Who was the biggest celebrity that called your show?  There had to be somebody.  Struff.  Struff.  From fanandsamfanclub.com.  The Struff?  Struff.  Oh, that's a biggie.  All right.  He's hard to get.  That's strong.  Yeah.  All right.  He didn't call into high society, so. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Pat's back alive.  Oh, wow.  Pat.  Pat's back.  We must have been disconnected.  Damn phone bill.  Pat, that guy did 60 double shots of eggnog first time out.  Bring it on.  He's practicing, and he's already done 60 double shots.  I've heard it all before.  How many did you do last year before you decided to be?  You're fat.  You're stupid.  Irresponsible.  Your father left.  I believe it was now 75.  75, I believe, was the number. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now I'm getting intel here.  David L. from Philly.  He said 30 regular shots, so that's 60.  Yeah.  That dude's an idiot, and you didn't even catch it.  Yeah, you didn't catch it.  He did 30 double shots.  No, 30 regular shots.  That's 15 double shots.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That guy's done.  Get that guy back on the phone.  I'm going to have to tell him he can't be in the competition.  He might be an early puker, which would be good.  Wait, so if he did 30 regular shots, Jimmy's right.  That's only 15 double shots. 
[02:36:00]  Easy out.  Easy out.  Pat did 75 double shots?  Yep.  Bring in the outfield.  Bring it in.  Bring it in.  No batter.  No batter.  Yeah, Pat, I don't think anyone's going to beat you.  Although I thought Joey Chestnut had a shot, but I don't think he's going to be able to do it.  Yeah, I don't think he can make it.  Why?  It's different than hot dogs.  Uh, no, no.  I'm just hoping he can't make it.  All right, sir. 
[02:36:30]  He wants to emerge victorious.  All right.  Hey, we got a big crowd today.  Indeed.  And they want to promote something.  Do they?  Do they?  Do they?  Who's the spokesperson out there?  Yeah.  Who's the spokesperson for you?  Who speaks for you?  Who speaks?  I know this, dude.  What's happening?  What's happening?  What's happening?  What are you doing, guys?  I see a big, uh, big sign that says XM Radio Gold, the fans board.  Wow.  What is it? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  A new, uh...  It started last week.  A new fan site?  Get on mic, bro.  This is the big...  You've got to sell your site.  All right.  We're going public today.  We started, uh, you know, last week developing it.  Google.  And it's, uh, the fan board.  It's the board where, uh, the fans are going to be.  But that's what every board says.  It's the fucking kiss-ass board without freedom of speech is what that is, motherfucker.  Well, I was on another board and was told if I didn't like it to leave, so... 
[02:37:30]  Let me tell you something.  That's going to be fucking run by the radio station because fucking...  Shut up.  Not you.  I'm kidding.  So they said you could leave, so you decided to start, uh, I'm not in on this whole political  thing that's going on out there, but...  What's it, uh, what's it called?  It's called XMRadioGold.com.  Ooh.  XMRadioGold.com.  Yep.  Okay.  And this is going to start as a fan site, and then it'll morph into just another... 
[02:38:00]  No.  ...website that bitch is about the show.  We're the fans that left a certain other message board because, uh, we're sick of the ruler.  Gotcha.  So.  Okay.  This is the new board.  XMRadioGold.com.  Yep.  And you're going to try to keep it more positive than negative.  Definitely positive.  That's all I ask.  I understand this.  You know what?  I understand there's negativity associated with every single fan site out there.  I get that.  But when it comes to the point where it's way more negative than positive, then I can't  look at it as a fan site anymore.  Yes.  That's all.  That's my rules. 
[02:38:30]  That's how I look at things.  We have, uh, and it doesn't mean that we can't be disagreeing with.  There are plenty of people that disagreed with me, like on Wackbag about the Jericho situation,  plenty of people that agreed with me.  Uh, I didn't like the way some of them took a certain tact about it because they were just  wrong.  I was sitting here.  And by the way, BJ Shane Seattle fucking rules.  Why?  What happened?  Because he had Jericho on and Mr. I'm over it.  First thing he says about me, he's like, oh yeah, that guy's an idiot.  So it's like, do we have audio of that?  Uh, I have it somewhere.  I think it's on, actually, you know, I said that knowing, I think we do. 
[02:39:00]  Well, I'm not really sure.  Which is fine.  I saw a YouTube video from BJ Shane and said, Chris Jericho.  So that must be the audio.  Yeah.  Can we get that?  But BJ was just cool.  Me and BJ worked together back in the day with Brother Weez.  He's, he's a, he's just a standup guy, man.  He really is, man.  He's a great guy.  He really is.  So, uh, but, but whatever.  If plenty of people disagree with me on that, eh, whatever.  Well, you know what?  Even though I've been jaded on a lot of message boards, when I go home, I will go and I will  register.  Thank you.  And, uh, I will scope around a little bit and see, uh, I, uh, see how that is. 
[02:39:30]  I wonder what name I'll use.  I'll support by the, I won't register.  All right.  I've never registered for a fan site.  A little known fact about me.  Never had an official name.  Well, I did for maybe a week and I posted once and then I got slammed and said, all right,  I get this.  I can't be part of this.  If you don't register, you can't become a super admin and boot people off for not seeing  things your way.  What I love is when people, I love when people are ultra critical about like pal talk and  other things.  And when you see they have 15,000 posts or 12,000. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  And it's like, I'm not saying there's anything even wrong with being a part of a message  board community.  It's fun.  You fucking hang with people.  You're talking shit, but it's like when you trash one way of communication and you spend  that many hours doing it, like how do you come off trashy wine, but like yours is fine.  Look who you're talking about.  Good point.  Look at the, the, the ilk you're talking about there.  All right.  That's how.  XMRadioGold.com.  Thumbs up out there.  Thumbs down.  What's going to be the, um, the official, uh, gang sign of that site sucks. 
[02:40:30]  I'm done with that.  Because, uh, that was always a good one.  Were there other names you guys were thinking of?  Oh, there were gang signs.  The number one name I wanted to do was Linger Longer, but it's taken.  LingerLonger.com.  What do you think?  Everything's taken.  I want to say hi to my Linger Longer pals out there.  I saw that.  I saw that thread.  What?  Linger.  I wouldn't even know what that is.  Is there, is there actually a site?  No.  A thread.  It's some type of like, uh, I don't know, bed company or something. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that's good.  Oh, the actual LingerLonger.com?  It's had it for like a few years, so I don't think I'll, I don't think we can get that.  Well, there you go.  XMRadioGold.com.  Doesn't, and will you be squishing bugs every once in a while?  If somebody needs to be squished.  Ooh, I like that.  I like that.  I like that in like, let's give us a few months.  That fucking XMRadioGold site.  Jesus Christ.  They all start out really, really cool and nice, and we get excited, and then we're like, 
[02:41:30]  oh boy.  I'm kidding, of course.  This is the fans board.  All right.  That's cool.  All right.  So it's XMRadioGold.com.  Up and running today?  Yep.  Yeah, I see like a total of, you're up to 10 posts.  That's pretty cool.  You start slow.  I'm just fucking with you, man.  So, this weekend programming, Opie and Anthony, Ron and Fez, general discussion, big boy made  a duty, off topic.  Very good.  There you go.  You'll get a few hundred people signing up today. 
[02:42:00]  Opening up a new store.  All right.  There you go.  Speaking of go-to bits, we have, here's the go-to bits.  Why are you here?  And one of them is Jared Skits.  Jared has been gone for months.  Why is he still on the go-to bits list?  All right.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah.  Your radio zoo host, Nathaniel, there is delusional.  Hold on.  Who's George Shea?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, Bruce.  We'll get to you in a second. 
[02:42:30]  Hang up on that.  George.  Yes.  Hi, George.  George, we're doing our eggnog drinking challenge once again this year, and you might remember  Pat from Minaki.  He's the star of the thing and the reigning champion.  And Joey Chestnut, who won the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest this year, wants in on the  eggnog drinking challenge.  Are you going to have a problem with that?  I don't know.  I have to explore it.  Joey Chestnut, you know, because the eggnog is so much more, how would you characterize 
[02:43:00]  it, volcanic than regular food.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, has, you know, Joey's capacity has got to be, I mean, just enormous relative  to Pat, I would think, but keeping it down is so difficult.  That's not the question I ask, sir.  Right.  Are you going to stop us from having Joey Chestnut in our competition?  Because supposedly there's some kind of like IFOCE problem with this whole thing.  Well, I haven't even spoken to Joey at all.  I would have to check with him first.  Well, how about, okay.  Well, we can talk to you.  Will there be a problem? 
[02:43:30]  Is there a problem?  Well, I have no idea.  You guys just called me on the phone.  I haven't spoken to him at all.  Well, who came in and said there might be a problem?  Like Hillary.  Steve?  No, I just, hold on.  We got Steve, George.  No, I just spoke to George.  He's going to look into whether or not we can get some of the competitive eaters this  year for.  Well, looking into George, is George the boss or kind of the head of it?  George?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Well, now, would you be able to get us possibly somebody from your organization or have somebody  from your organization participate in our competition? 
[02:44:00]  What's this rumor that you guys want money for that?  No, I was just talking to your producer.  You know, I didn't know what he was talking about.  Typically when we go, you know, we do a big event.  And it's a paid event.  But I recognize the reach of Opie and Anthony.  I understand you guys have a great platform.  I just haven't even explored it at all.  Okay.  And our pal, Pat, from Monaki.  Yes, more importantly.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's have Pat talk to George.  Pat, from Monaki, you're on with George Shea, the what, CEO of IFOCE or whatever? 
[02:44:30]  President.  President.  Okay.  All right, Pat, what do you got for George?  Hey.  Oh, hi, George.  Hi, Pat.  How's it going?  I don't think Joey can make it to that eggnog contest.  Say it again?  He's busy that day.  What?  He's busy that day, Joey.  Pat, you're panicking.  That's everything.  Oh, what?  Oh, my God.  Yes, Pat, Pat.  Pat, what you wanted to talk about. 
[02:45:00]  About Spike and, you know, 16.  Spike and being slighted.  Here's the guy.  Ask him personally.  I felt a little passed over for that Spike.  I was passed over.  That's the way God wanted me to.  Yeah.  I'm smart.  Not like people say.  So, George, Pat feels, since he's a nervous nelly right now, that the top 16 people were  being done for the Spike TV thing.  Pat feels like he was stepped over.  Or why was Pat stepped over if he is legitimately number 16? 
[02:45:30]  I don't think it was necessarily the top 16.  I think it was more like an invitational.  And it was not, obviously, entirely in our hands.  When we did the last one that we did, we did top 32 and top 16.  But I don't think it was.  Was it top 16?  I don't believe it was.  Well, it was a press release of the top 16 in the world.  So, a press release says that, why would there be top 16?  That's such a weird number.  It was like, you know, drop it down, you know, like cut in half, cut in half. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, they run it like March Madness.  Yeah.  So, was Pat slighted?  He's saying he was ranked 16th.  I don't dispute that.  Pat was not slighted a lot.  I mean, he's the widely recognized and hailed as the eggnog ring champion of the world.  No one would ever slight him.  But I don't know, I don't believe that there was any, you know, bias in the selection.  I just don't think they went by the top 16.  Pat?  Yes? 
[02:46:30]  Do you feel that they did or didn't?  Well, I saw the press release.  I have, there's a thread on Black Bag where I put a link to the press release.  And it said, the top 16 eaters, and that's how it usually was, like the last Alka-Seltzer thing that they had a couple years ago.  That was the top 20.  And then they never skipped over before.  I mean, I didn't personally do the selection, Pat, but I think that there was, what was his name from, El Toro from Las Vegas was in there, 
[02:47:00]  and he's ranked like 40-something.  I think that they were picking individuals out and that it wasn't the top 16.  They may have positioned it in the press release as, like, you know, watch the, you know, the world's greatest eaters.  So basically, were they picking people who were not fat, George?  Oh, on the contrary.  They were picking people they felt were charismatic, although I feel that, you know, obviously Pat is very charismatic.  Of course.  Yes, he is.  So why wouldn't Spike pick them? 
[02:47:30]  Spike didn't think that.  Well, all right.  Well, Pat, how about the other event you said you thought you were passed over?  What was the other one?  Oh, that was the next one, the noodle one.  That was just an invitational.  That wasn't necessarily the top people, but they skipped over me again.  Well, Pat, was it the top 15 and then 17?  How did they skip over you?  Yeah, they had 17 and then they had, I think, 23.  So you weren't the only one skipped over that.  If it was top 16, they had 17, 23. 
[02:48:00]  Who else was skipped over it?  Uh, no, no.  Pretty much they had the top people and then when they got to me, they kind of leaped over me.  No, I don't, you know, I understand why you're sensitive, Pat, but there was, I mean, I don't, not certain that's the way it went.  You know, they're, they're, these things are, these things are picked by people who look at the, you know, at the, uh, rankings.  They say, well, I want this guy, you know, he's got crazy hair.  I want this, you know, it wasn't, it's not like you're being, uh, stepped over.  Yeah, but aren't the rankings the rankings? 
[02:48:30]  If it's one through 16 and Pat is 16, he should be in it.  Not, you know, skipped over for some guy that looks a little wackier or something.  That's better hair.  Yeah, what is that?  Right, but, but I, I know what you're saying, but no one ever said that they were going to, what they were going to do is you take the top ranked people.  We have done that in the past and Pat was involved.  You know, we did the, we did, I think, the top 32.  Pat, were you in that one?  No, back then, no, I wasn't ranked then.  That's when I first started.  And then they had the year where they didn't have the sponsor, where they didn't even have it.  So, I mean, Pat has been to Coney Island, the greatest contest in the world, without doubt, the greatest, uh, you know, event of the world. 
[02:49:00]  Well, I'll show them on TV.  Without doubt.  Well, you, you got a few ahead of you there, George.  Maybe the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Well, where would you guys place it, honestly?  It's definitely up there.  Oscars.  It's above Wimbledon.  VH, uh.  Above Wimbledon?  Above Wimbledon.  I put it.  I'd put it above, I'd put it between Wimbledon and the Westminster Dog Show.  Yeah, I think it's somewhere between the Super Bowl and Planned Parenthood dumpster diving. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  But you are just ahead of WNBA basketball, the finals anyway.  But barely.  That's a real event.  It's a really, uh, famous event.  Yeah.  I'd like to see that.  Curse splat.  All right, well, we didn't get much done here, George.  That sounds like a belly flop.  Sounds like most of this is in Pat's head.  And he wasn't slighted on purpose. 
[02:50:00]  With a lot of fat.  George, you're going to see if some of your guys can compete in the eggnog drinking challenge?  It's early December, right?  And this is the deal I make you.  And it's simple.  I don't want to hear nothing else.  Huge exposure for your organization.  That's it.  Okay, so let me check into it.  Of course, it's in a slightly divergent, this is drinking, but of course, I would think  that would fall under our mandate.  Not drinking alcohol, obviously.  It's just, you know.  Eggnog.  Eggnog without the alcohol.  Is there a record?  Because I would guess that Pat's last effort might have been disqualified, right? 
[02:50:30]  I mean, is there a...  Why is his disqualified?  Didn't he have a reversal of fortune?  Oh, he did that on purpose after he had won the event.  What was the...  How much did he drink?  75 to 76.  Double shots?  75.  75.  75 double shots.  And is it a one-on-one?  Does he come back to defend his title?  Yeah, he's won two out of the three.  All right, well...  This will be the fourth year, I believe.  Huh?  I mean, that seems to me to be something to be seen. 
[02:51:00]  And Badlands Booker won the...  Yeah.  Badlands Booker won the one that Pat did not win by literally a half a shot or whatever.  Was that close?  Half a shot.  Yeah.  And what was his number?  Was it above 75?  No, the...  It was like 71 or 71.  Yeah, the official record is 75 double shots eggnog that Pat did last year.  Last standing rule.  Yeah.  And this year we're doing it in a venue there, George, in front of a lot of listeners.  No, I remember.  I mean, you guys know this... 
[02:51:30]  Shut up.  Everybody, everybody was talking about it last year.  Well, we would like to have Pat involved.  No, Pat will be involved.  No, not just in our event.  I hope we would have been invited to this one.  I'll cry if I'm not.  You'll cry even if you are.  Yeah, this is Pat's big...  George, this is Pat's big day, so...  All right, well, listen.  Let me check in there.  I'll call Steve.  Thank you.  All right, thank you, George.  Good luck.  He'll be right now.  His hand is scrolling.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Scroll, upload, scroll, upload.  Tony.  Hey, what's up? 
[02:52:00]  Are you the guy we just gave an invite to?  Yep.  Tony, you did 30 shots of eggnog?  30 double shots my first night, just hanging out.  You did do 30 double shots.  Okay.  I think you did 30 single shots.  I might have.  I might have been nervous or something, but we did 30 double shots.  All right, 30 double shots.  That would be 60 shots eggnog, but we used a double shot thing.  But Pat did 75 double shots.  Yeah, so you're not even close, Tony.  You have to do another 45.  Double shots.  Double shots.  I'm practicing.  You're so gay. 
[02:52:30]  All right, well, 30 double shots eggnog is pretty respectable.  So, all right, you're still in.  That's all right.  We were thinking you might have done only 15.  That would have been the...  Yeah.  Pathetic.  We really want some real competitors this year.  All right, Tony, thank you.  All right, later.  Pat, we got to go.  We got to take a break.  Okay.  Hey, Pat, if you can't be good, be careful.  Eggnog drinking challenge goes down December 7th, I think at the Hard Rock Cafe, somewhere  around 16.  A date that will live in infamy. 
[02:53:00]  That's right.  We do it live this year in front of everybody.  So, it's going to be very, very exciting.  All right, Pat.  I miss Pat.  Yeah, I haven't had him on in a while.  We haven't seen him in a while.  All right, Pat.  All right, Pat.  Bye.  We have to talk to Iraq.  What's up?  Why?  Iraq did his sleep study, remember?  Oh.  He was having all kinds of trouble, I guess.  Okay.  And he had his sleep study.  I just want to know what that entails with Iraq. 
[02:53:30]  All right, we'll do that next.  I'm thinking driving into work, taking his position behind the desk.  You know, everything he does here could be used in the sleep study.  All right, we'll see what went down with that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, nice. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, nice.  Oh, nice. 
[02:54:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So, Iraq did a sleep study. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, he was having problems.  He came up with all these medical problems all of a sudden.  One day, he's down in the dumps.  As we like to say, down in the dumps.  And we asked him, what's wrong, Iraq?  And out of nowhere, he came up with this.  He's got some fucking medical shit going on.  And for one of these things, he had to go for a sleep study.  What was the other shit you had?  Some kind of nerve thing where your hand would go numb?  And then your mind would quickly follow? 
[02:55:30]  The other thing they think I might have is autonomic peripheral neuropathy.  Nice.  What does that mean?  It means my nervous system is having a hard time regulating my body temperature.  Oh, right, the temperature, because then your temperature goes up and then down, and you can't just regulate it.  Well, how is that?  Your body kind of senses the things you do around here and is interpreting you as a glacier?  Glacier, it's a long way to walk for a lazy joke, huh? 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, it's really sorry.  Glacier, laugh every time.  Because they're huge.  Unlike Iraq.  I meant slow.  Ah.  Not slow and huge.  I didn't mean big.  I meant that you move like a glacier.  I wasn't saying that.  I honestly was not a fat joke.  I was saying that you're more of a slow piece of shit, not like a, no disrespect.  So you get, none taken, don't worry about it.  So you get, like, high temperature.  How high does it go? 
[02:56:30]  98.6 is normal, right?  It's averaging around 99.9, 100.  Oh, that's like a little fever.  At certain times, I'll hit 101 for no reason.  And then other times it drops below.  Like, I'll be 96, 97, and I'll be freezing.  Jesus.  Yeah.  And they told you what this might be?  How long does it take to figure out what it is?  Um, for the first part, I go in tomorrow afternoon to get some of that, uh, the results for that,  those tests.  Yeah.  The sleep study, I won't find out for 10 days. 
[02:57:00]  And what did the sleep study have to do with this?  Um, they, well, there was this issue, and then they thought that it was being aggravated  by the, that I might have sleep apnea.  So, I'm not getting enough oxygen while I'm sleeping.  Right.  So, um, the problem was, I was waking up in the middle of the night like I was burning.  And they think that I, that I'd stop breathing during the night, so my body would just start  pumping adrenaline to wake me up.  So, it, your body, you thought you were dead. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  And had to react accordingly.  So, you shoot out of the bed feeling like you're burning, and you can't calm down.  Like, you need to run around for a while just to get all that out of you.  Because you feel like you're hot, right?  Yeah.  Constantly.  How about putting a fan on yourself?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, how about that?  What about a cold shower?  What happens, Eric?  I have to throw back the electric blanket.  Oh.  That's the problem.  To get the hot water bottle off my head.  No, it's, it's usually the air conditioner's on, full blast, right on me.  Yeah.  Even in the winter.  Or in the winter, the windows are always open. 
[02:58:00]  Windows are open.  No heat on, windows open.  Wow, that is freaky.  So, now the sleep study.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, you go in, uh, and, well, they, they put,  all kinds of sensors on you.  It, it looks like an, an asylum.  You walk in, it's all white and gray.  That's what I pictured.  It looks like a loony bin.  It's only a couple blocks from here.  Oh.  And, um, you walk in, they have to escort you from the elevator to wherever you go.  You're not allowed to be alone at any time.  Yeah.  Why?  This is their problem.  It's an insane asylum. 
[02:58:30]  He, he went to a crazy house.  So, they, um, they escort me to my room, and you get into the room.  Um, there's a bed with, like, a million wires just laying all over the place,  and cameras, and some other machines.  So, you have to wait there for the, like, saw.  You have to wait there for the technician to show up.  When he shows up, it took 35 minutes just to get all these wires on me.  How, wait, how, what do they do if you have to piss?  Um, well, this happened later, uh, after the wiring went on. 
[02:59:00]  You have to take everything with you and go to the other side of the building.  But, you're sitting there with the technician, like, in shorts and a t-shirt.  Wow.  They, um, they apply all these cables to, um, your chest, your shoulders, all over your head,  your face, your legs.  And then it all gets plugged into this, um, like, green electronic box.  It looks like an old phone switchboard.  Great.  So, then the little green box gets hooked to the wall, which, now, all that information 
[02:59:30]  is being transferred to some remote computer room.  No, it's not.  It's just an empty box going to the wall.  We were just fucking with you.  But, uh, they have to apply all the stuff with some kind of, um, it's almost like cement.  So, you've got these, these blotches of, uh, gray, like, pasted all over you to hold everything in.  Your little wires, okay.  Now, but, how do you, like, how do you go to sleep?  With all that shit on you.  You have to lay down, once they get everything in, you have to lay down on the bed. 
[03:00:00]  Then they add a few more wires to you while you're, you're laying down straight on the  bed on your back.  And then they tell you to make cumzies, and that puts you to sleep.  Then they hook your entire body into the system in the wall.  So, once it's hooked into the wall, then the cameras that are, um, on the ceiling facing  down to the bed.  Do you have to sleep on your back?  For the most part, yeah.  I could never do it then.  How is that a fucking test of the way somebody's, I can't sleep on my back with wires on me, 
[03:00:30]  much less.  No.  What a shitty fucking system.  I know I have apneics.  I wake up every 10 minutes gasping for air.  Do you?  Test fixed.  They tell you you can't, like, sleep on your side or your belly or any of that.  You're allowed to turn your head to the side, but you're not allowed to turn your body if  you, while you're sleeping.  Well, they're not going to get an accurate freaking.  Yeah, who the fuck sleeps like that?  It'll be, it'll be the wake test.  I don't even start sleeping until I go on my side.  I might start falling asleep, but I can't sleep that way.  Will they drug you at least?  No.  Oh, then fuck that.  So, you're on your back. 
[03:01:00]  So, you're on your back, and you have all these wires on you.  Now, the cameras are going, and they also have the night vision.  So, they're watching everything you do while you sleep.  The cameras are going, and then there's a speaker that they don't tell you about that's behind  your head.  All of a sudden, somebody starts talking to you, and they're like, Eric?  Yeah?  I need you to blink five times.  So, you're blinking, and then you're moving your eyes in every direction, show us how  you grind your teeth, show you, show us, uh, uh, flex your legs, flex your arms, you're 
[03:01:30]  getting a read of every possible movement before you go to sleep to see how you are, before  you're out cold.  Eat a BLT.  Yeah, exactly.  So, you're laying there, and then they go, okay, go to sleep.  The technicians leave, they shut the door, it's pitch black, all you see are the, these,  this red circle from where the camera is.  And what time is it?  It's about 10.30.  10.30 at night, so you're ready to go to sleep.  This sucks.  All right, so, so they tell you, go to sleep. 
[03:02:00]  Now, how the fuck long does it take to go to sleep?  Well, I, I don't know, but they survey you through the whole time.  So, I'm sleeping, I think, about an hour.  Then they come in, and they wake you up.  That's fun.  To see how you are, I guess, like a nap kind of thing.  How did you sleep, how did you fall asleep like that, dude?  I, I, honestly, I don't know.  I know it took me a while.  Did you get to pee?  But I was in there.  I did a little later on.  So, they come in, and they wake you up.  Yeah, you have to get up now.  So, now they unplug me.  They put the wires around my neck.  So, now I'm carrying the little green box where all the wires are connected to, and the 
[03:02:30]  rest of the wires over my right side.  Were you wearing a little gown with your hiney sticking out?  No.  So, they make you get up and walk around for a little while, for about 10 minutes.  So, I'm walking around the place.  This is, I guess, to see how you are when you're napping.  And then you come back, and then they put you back to sleep again.  Oh, they want your deeper sleep.  How do you fall back to sleep, Eric?  I don't know.  And then I lay down in bed.  They hook you up again.  Go to sleep.  So, now this is supposed to be the long term.  So, I go to sleep. 
[03:03:00]  I remember getting woken up the first time.  A guy came in, I guess, because I turned, and some of the wires moved, so they had to  fix it.  They push you back down on your back, and you have to go back to sleep again.  Push you down?  Like, he...  You sure he was part of the test?  Yeah.  He was an orderly.  And they put this big thing in your mouth, and you have to sleep while they pump the tube  in and out of your mouth.  So, I'm laying on my back again.  I'm falling asleep.  Then, all of a sudden, I'm hearing something through that speaker where they're calling 
[03:03:30]  my name, and I finally wake up again, just as somebody comes flying through the door,  goes over to this machine to my right, and puts one of those little oxygen masks over  me.  Because, apparently, I stopped breathing while I was sleeping.  Oh.  So, they have to...  My heart rate dropped so low, and then it just seemed like I wasn't breathing at all.  So, they had to put this mask on me for a while until I fell back asleep again.  Holy shit.  You're fucked up. 
[03:04:00]  You got the apnea, huh?  You have to.  Probably.  Yeah.  So, then, um...  You're gonna have to sleep with that dumb mask.  I guess while I'm sleeping, somebody came in again and took the mask off, because the  next time I woke up, I didn't have it on.  But, now, this time it's around 3 a.m., and I'm burning.  Like, I can't sit still.  I gotta get up.  So, they're telling me I can't, so I can't get up and walk around.  So, I say I have to go to the bathroom.  So, the technician comes in, unplugs everything again, wraps it around me.  Now, I go into the bathroom trying to cool down. 
[03:04:30]  I'm sitting there, just running my hands and my arms and my face under the water, just trying  to cool down.  And wound up having to go back to bed again.  And next thing I know, it was 7 in the morning.  And you don't know yet what this...  It doesn't sound good.  I gotta...  I'll tell you that much.  It doesn't sound like they're gonna go, well, that's fine.  Ah, sleep apnea, and you gotta get that dumb mask, and then you'll never have sex again,  because you're gonna look stupid.  But you'll sleep great.  It's supposed to help you sleep, but how do you sleep with that mask on? 
[03:05:00]  Get a picture of those masks.  They're ridiculous.  I can't...  I forgot where I saw it.  Was it your dad?  Yeah, it was in the Sopranos to Uncle Junior.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  I knew I saw it somewhere.  I can't...  Fucking...  I hate sleep.  And my nose.  Yeah, you just gotta get your sinuses fixed.  You know what?  I have apnea, too.  Fucking cowardly lion.  You know who does a great impression of that? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, Twitchell.  I wish he was here.  Hypopotamus!  Who can actually look at him when he's doing that?  I can't even think of him while I do it.  I can't.  I'm thinking of it now.  It is so cringeworthy when he goes into that fucking awful impression.  Because he really does it.  Oh!  He's spitting.  His face gets all contorted.  You just want to punch him in his stupid Tourette's face.  I know.  And then he does that stupid impression.  There's a mask.  Look, it looks like a pig's nose.  There it is.  How the fuck do you sleep with that thing on your head? 
[03:06:00]  It looks like you're a pilot in the Iraq War.  You should be sucking a dick at the Shining, the Overlook Hotel.  Screw the sleeping part.  How do you get laid ever again?  Just put that on her face and pump fucking little sleep gases in there.  There you go.  Iraq, that's your future right there.  There it is.  Can we Photoshop your face on there?  I want to see what you're going to look like.  Oh, please.  With the pig nose mask.  Get that on the boards immediately.  I was walking around.  There's a different mask where it's a plastic tube that goes in your mouth. 
[03:06:30]  So it keeps your mouth open the whole night while you're sleeping.  That's what my dad has.  What do you mean a plastic tube?  It forces you to breathe through your mouth instead of your nose.  What is it, hollow?  Yeah.  Peter Frampton?  Wow.  What do you go?  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  It keeps your mouth open?  Keeps your mouth open.  Oh, my God.  It forces air in and out so you're forced to breathe through your mouth.  Your girl's going to have a great night of sleep with all that bad breath that knocks her out.  Oh, no.  That was uncalled for.  It's going to knock her right the fuck out.  Holy shit.  Is this a tube?  Can't you choke on the tube? 
[03:07:00]  No, it's attached to something.  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  It's a whole getup.  A whole getup.  Yeah.  Look at these masks.  That's your future.  Oh, my God, no.  That's how you're going to have to sleep so your heart doesn't stop.  Wow.  I'm serious.  You're going to have to sleep apnea.  All right.  Well, there's your EROC update.  Well, that doesn't...  Did you feel like you had a good night's sleep?  No, it was horrible.  It was horrible.  Nightmarish?  Nightmarish.  How'd you doze off?  I can't comprehend.  I honestly don't know because every time you woke...  Sorry, in the morning when you woke up, they give you a survey. 
[03:07:30]  How long do you think it took you to fall asleep?  What do you think was happening while you were sleeping?  How about you know?  You write this in.  Fill it in.  You were watching me.  Everything was a survey.  What do you think you did?  What do you...  How do you think this reacted?  You're monitoring me.  I have no...  Do you think they got video of you touching your wee-wee at night?  Maybe you did a little.  I don't do that.  I'd love to.  You don't touch your own wee-wee?  What's wrong with you?  You touch your wee-wee?  How often do you jerk off?  I don't know. 
[03:08:00]  Average amount?  I'd give you...  What's an average amount?  Please say 12 times a day.  What is average amount?  He made a cock ring out of the wires.  What's an average amount there, EroC?  Probably at least once a day.  That's not that bad.  At least once a day and you got a girl?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Are you a quick comer?  No.  When you fuck?  No.  Do you talk dirty in bed?  Sometimes.  Say something dirty.  No, no.  Are you more dominant or submissive? 
[03:08:30]  If the sandwich fell on the floor, I'd still eat it.  I don't even kiss it up to God.  Either or, depending on the...  Dude, you jerk off more than once a day?  No, I said...  And you're getting married?  Once a day.  That's good practice.  At least once a day.  You said at least once a day.  More than once a day.  That means at least seven times a week.  That means probably closer to ten times a week.  I'm pretty much taking care of, so I don't need to do that.  I'm pretty much taking care of, so I don't really need to.  Ah, you know what?  That would have been nice if you said it before you said it.  Yeah, now you're backpedaling. 
[03:09:00]  You idiot.  Don't you know what a backpedal is?  How about this?  Say something dirty that you would say in bed.  Not necessarily with this girl, but any girl.  You're dominant.  Say something dominant.  I want to hear dirty talking, Iraq.  All right, close your eyes, Iraq.  What would you say?  Everybody closed their eyes.  And ears.  Go ahead.  Sometimes it's a little angry. 
[03:09:30]  Fucking cunt.  Fist in the face.  No.  No?  What is it?  Not that angry.  Sometimes.  Fuck OB.  How am I supposed to know what he's thinking?  I'm not even looking in that direction.  I made you hero number two on my list.  Sometimes it's like, you know, the typical, you like that?  Do you want me to believe that?  Hold on.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  Hold on.  We need an orgasm.  Yeah.  Or some porno music or something.  No, we need orgasm.  Give me one that's a little long.  We'll make believe we're in the middle of you banging some broad.  And then what you would say to get her really going over the top.  Do we have a Iraq sleeping mask?  It's one of those Hulk Hogan Halloween masks.  Where's a good orgasm?  All right.  Here we go.  Let me try one here.  So it's either this one. 
[03:10:30]  What's wrong?  Nothing.  It's funny.  But that's.  No.  He was just going into his dirty talk.  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  So you got the person going.  What would you say to him?  What's wrong?  You're working it and you start, you know, you got your rhythm going.  Yeah.  And you're just kind of looking at her dead on. 
[03:11:00]  Like you're almost looking through her kind of thing.  You like that?  Yeah.  You like that?  Do you want me to.  You know, you start grabbing the hair and holding the face a little bit.  Wait, so you just made love to a dude, bro.  You, uh.  Why'd you fall for that?  Oh.  You clench your teeth?  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here's the chick.  Here's the chick.  We got the porno music.  Close your eyes.  You're in the middle of it. 
[03:11:30]  Go ahead.  What do you say to get this over the top?  Go ahead.  You're on E.  Okay.  Come on.  Are you pulling the hair at all?  What are you doing?  Pulling the hair a little bit.  Sometimes you're holding the face.  Yeah.  Almost like, uh, the hands over the face, like gripping it like a mask, kind of.  Oh, that's comfortable.  I'm just like, yeah, you like that?  You like that?  Is this doing it for you?  Yeah.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You're going to come for me. 
[03:12:00]  You're going to come for me.  Do it.  Wait, keep going.  And you start yelling.  Keep going.  Keep going.  And what do you do after you say to come for me?  And she says no.  Well, here's her response.  That's kind of violent, bro.  Not all the time.  It's a rarity on it.  You're grabbing her face and stuff.  No one likes a hand over there.  She has to smell your hand.  She's got like fucking.  It's not like this.  Yeah, it's over her face.  No one likes that.  There's a fine line between getting a little rough with your talk and like grabbing her face. 
[03:12:30]  I'm coming.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  I'm going to fuck you in my mouth.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it.  You let one drop spill and I'll whip your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Do you like that?  Is that doing it?  Do you actually say, is that doing it for you?  Do you grit your teeth like that?  Yeah.  Is that doing it for you?  I have apnea.  Is that doing it for you? 
[03:13:00]  Do you have a pet name?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  It's, I don't know.  He calls a girl hot pussy and she calls him incompetent.  Oh, I'm not coming.  Stop.  All right, let's go to Kevin in Minnesota.  Kevin, what's up?  Yeah, I use one of the machines like E-Rock was talking about every night.  The mask thing that keeps your mouth open?  Nah, I've got one that fits over my nose and my mouth.  Are you married, sir? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is it a little awkward to put that mask on every night?  Oh, yeah, but put it on after activities.  No, dude, what you should do is put the mask on and make her suck your dick and look at  you while she's swallowing your load with that stupid mask on.  And then say, I pay the mortgage.  Huh?  We tried that.  It works.  It's just like I feel like Darth Vader when I'm doing that.  I think I would rather die in my sleep.  Let's give that a whirl.  No, I'm being.  Darth Vader's better.  I'm being serious. 
[03:14:00]  I've thought about this.  You know, you're going to start getting older and all of a sudden you've got to go to  bed with apparatuses and stuff.  How long are you supposed to wear it?  Forever.  You've got to wear it all the time.  Yeah.  Every night.  For the rest of your life.  I was stopping breathing about 180 times an hour when I took that test.  Yurok, just die in your sleep.  And I love you.  And I swear to God, I'm saying, have some pride. 
[03:14:30]  Because she thinks of you as her man.  And now you're going to be this like dork with a mask sleeping every night.  I couldn't go down that road.  Is that doing it for you?  Do you like that?  Yeah.  Here's, we got a little audio of you in the bedroom here.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a ling on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the same.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  See, that doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother me a bit.  Doesn't bother her either.  You know what?  God bless you, Kevin. 
[03:15:00]  I'm not even trying to make a joke.  I wouldn't be able to bring weird apparatuses to bed to make myself sleep and shit.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  I can see Yurok talking dirty in the middle of it.  Hold on a minute.  Getting some oxygen in between sessions.  No, because the more sleep you get, the more better sleep you get.  More gooder.  Listen longer.  Yeah.  More red butt cells. 
[03:15:30]  More red butt cells.  You're falling apart, sir.  Yeah.  I'm really not making this sound good.  All right.  Yeah, your heart rate's dropping here.  I wouldn't mind a sleep mask.  I just couldn't go through the test.  I just want to go get a mask.  Get me one.  Really?  Just assume I failed.  Well, it beats not sleeping.  I mean, my shitty sleep wrecks my life.  Do you understand how bad my nose is?  I can't breathe.  It's fucking horrible.  Well, maybe you just need the nose job.  They'll ream out of the nostrils or some shit.  Are you going to get the surgery?  If I can find a good doctor. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I've got one.  You do?  She's going in January for it.  How good is this doctor?  Apparently pretty good.  Thanks.  Apparently.  That's a great sales job.  I've never met the guy, but she just texted me to recommend the doctor to you.  All right.  Let's go to Jeremy in Wisconsin.  She wants me to go first, so if I die, she'll find somebody else.  Jeremy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I have sleep apnea.  I went through all that shit, too.  And it's pretty fucking weird.  Especially sex, too.  Because, I don't know, I used to take it off in the middle of the night, but she woke me up before and having sex with it on is... 
[03:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, having sex with Darth Vader.  Yeah, your woman looks at you like...  That's the worst call we've ever gotten.  Yeah.  He not only was falling apart, but then he took the other guy's Darth Vader line.  The Darth Vader line.  We got it.  There's other people with masks.  All right.  Let's...  Can you figure out one other person with a mask that you can use?  You're like the Obi-Wan?  No, wait.  C-3PO.  Boba Fett. 
[03:17:00]  Jesus Christ.  We got a celebrity on the phone.  You can use this, Than, for the next Than and Sam show.  They had a big celebrity.  You guys need a big celebrity.  We got them.  Can you put him on hold when you're done?  Sure.  It's Matt from Queensbury.  Oh, Matt from Queensbury.  Big celebrity.  I got to meet Matt when I was up there.  Matt's a big guy.  Yes, I'm a big guy.  Like a linebacker.  How big?  Just solid.  Well, I was a wrestler my whole life, and now that it's been a few years in the gym, now a few years out of the gym.  So I probably would be solid at 250. 
[03:17:30]  He looks like a power lifter.  Oh, really?  Up to the three area.  Who the fuck pinned you?  What a big head he had.  Who pinned you ever?  I know.  Well, even worse was back in high school, I wrestled at about 167, 177, and then spent a lot of years in the gym after that and bulked up a hair.  You think Chuck Liddell could tap you?  Well, with the tap-out moves and the choke holds, you know, he might be able to, but I think if I got a hold of him, he might have a hard time getting away. 
[03:18:00]  Really?  Hmm.  Guy's talking some shit.  How about Kevin Randall then?  Yeah, I mean, as long as it only lasted like 30 seconds after that, I might need to take a rest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, that being said, I do have one of those apnea machines.  Aye.  And as many bad things that can be said about them, the good they do is just amazing.  I mean, I had severe, chronic, obstructive sleep apnea, which meant I was exhausted all the time.  I would sometimes take a nap at red lights. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  I've done that, but it hasn't been from apnea.  Yes.  And at work, I'd sleep at my desk.  Every time I had a break, I'd sleep, go down and sleep in my car.  I could fall asleep immediately at any point at any time.  And then when I got that machine, as silly looking as it is, it was like the best thing that ever happened.  How does your machine work?  How do you put it on?  Like, is yours the mouth tube or?  No, it goes over your nose.  And you don't put it on and then say to your girlfriend, hey, you want to watch some porn and hook up? 
[03:19:00]  You know, you put it on the second before you're going to go to bed for real.  How uncomfortable is it?  It really didn't take much getting used to just because it was just such an amazing thing to finally be able to sleep during the night.  And as far as the sleeping on your side, sleeping on your back, you can move about, but most of the time when you move, when you're sleeping, it's because you're uncomfortable.  And usually I fall asleep on my back with my hands folded on my chest, and I wake up that way. 
[03:19:30]  I don't even move at all during the night.  Well, I get dizzy if I lay on my back too long.  But do you have bad sinuses?  As a matter of fact, my sinuses still aren't that great, but with the forced air through the nasal passage, they clear out while I'm sleeping.  So, you know, I breathe through my nose all night, not through my mouth at all.  And the other thing about the mask too is usually if you have apnea, you snore like a son of a bitch, which I did.  Wait a minute, how do I get one of these? How do I get a mask? 
[03:20:00]  Well, normally you have a sleep clinic thing.  But, I mean, you can find machines on eBay and stuff.  Are you some of a used machine? No.  No, no.  There's mucus in it.  You can find a used or new machine, but you can get all new...  What does it look like? Darth Vader?  Yeah, you can get a new hose and a new...  Oh my God, enough about the apnea!  Well, the thing is...  I'd rather read my cell phone contract again.  No, but in EROC's defense, if you have sleep apnea, it can cause you to gain a lot of weight. 
[03:20:30]  Ah, well, there you go.  Because it screws up your metabolism.  Start eating again.  Now, also, enough about the apnea.  I do want to thank Jimmy and Kenny for hooking me up with the show up here.  Jimmy's new material is amazing.  Oh, thanks for coming, man.  Anybody who hasn't seen him, I urge you to go.  We had a great time.  All right.  All right, very good.  Thanks, very good.  All right, let's go to Vinny in Pennsylvania.  Vinny, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Let me get this straight.  You're supposed to wear this mask while you're sleeping, and these people are calling in 
[03:21:00]  talking about having sex while wearing the mask.  Do we see a problem here?  Well, I don't think most of the people are having sex while wearing the mask, but I think...  Well, these guys are saying, oh, it's like having sex with Darth Vader.  Yes, it's like having sex with a sleeping Darth Vader.  You're wondering why you're having...  Hold on, hold on.  Now, when two Darth Vader lines in a row bomb,  what made you think that if you put a sleeping Darth Vader in, that was going to knock it  out of the park?  By the way, all I'm saying is, I think it affects your sex life if you're wearing all this weird 
[03:21:30]  shit while you're sleeping.  I think your woman wants to look at you like you're like some fucking, you know, stud.  Not, hold on a minute, I've got to put my sleep mask on.  I'll tell you what affects your sex life.  It's your wife staring at you in the morning.  Do you have any idea how loud you were fucking snoring last night, you bastard?  As if you're doing it on purpose.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think it would affect your sex life because, again, you're going to fuck  before you put it on.  My girlfriend doesn't look at me when I'm sleeping and think anything, probably, except 
[03:22:00]  look at this lump that I've been fucking.  I don't think my girlfriend...  You know, this magazine's out there of people wearing all sorts of crazy masks while they're  doing it.  Right, Darth Vader.  We're not doing it from medicinal.  Of course.  We get it.  Yeah.  What, you're looking at Darth Vader doing a handstand.  Luke, I have apnea.  I'll do it for you.  The Imperial Emperor likes to sleep comfortably, Luke.  A cavalcade of crashes with a Darth Vader reference. 
[03:22:30]  I can't breathe.  It's like I'm wearing a Yoda mask.  Uh-oh, here he comes.  Oh, boy.  Butcher, right on cue.  And 18 lines in.  All right, Benny, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Give me the mask.  I can't breathe.  This isn't funny at all.  No matter how many times the caller calls in with this, it will not be funny. 
[03:23:00]  I look ridiculous.  My wife doesn't want to have sex with me.  Wait, my accent isn't even right anymore.  Fuck.  Tim H. from Columbus, Ohio.  Holy shit, is this dull.  Are you going to talk about menopause next?  Enough about the sleep apnea.  Hey, fuck Tim H.  Fuck you.  But the phone's running in.  Fuck him in his fucking hole.  Exactly.  A lot of people deal with it.  Tough fucking shit for Tim H. 
[03:23:30]  I don't sleep good.  And now we're talking about it.  And our own E-Rock has been dying a slow death every night.  All right, one more.  Detroit, Jake.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Good to hear you.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock.  Listen, I had the same problems that you had.  Exactly.  Went to the clinic.  I mean, it was, you know, horseshit trying to get to sleep.  But I've got the mask on.  I've had it for about 10 years.  And it is awesome.  Let me tell you something.  For the guys that don't know out there, keep in mind that the hose that goes from the mask to the apparatus is ripped. 
[03:24:00]  My wife and I have had plenty of fun with that ripped hose.  No, you haven't.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  No, you haven't.  You know what's even better?  Having her straddle your colostomy bag.  Exactly.  And just pump away on your shit bag.  Can the women call and, you know, prove my point that it just takes the sexiness out of the whole fucking thing if your guy's wearing some weird thing to bed?  Well, that's it.  But if you're going to sleep with a thing on, like if you're sleeping, it's like once you're sleeping, you're sleeping.  But she turns over and sees you applying the mask and I don't know, man. 
[03:24:30]  Well, if your fucking woman is that shallow that she'd rather have you dying in her sleep, just fucking jerk off in a prostitute's mouth anyway.  If your woman is that fucking shallow that she, I don't want you to live.  I want to look at you while you're sleeping and think you're hot as you're leaking shit all over your pillow.  None of us are sexy.  We get eye gunk built up.  Our fucking eyes are closed.  Oh, I have to fuck that.  I understand, but I don't know.  Shit.  Any fucking woman, as much problems as they have with their pussies, I tolerate you sticking that plug up your cunt every fucking Monday. 
[03:25:00]  Dude, they hide that shit from you, though.  It's not right in the open.  It's all over the bathroom.  You go to the bathroom, there's a fucking bloody thing.  Hey, did you commit a murder or are you on your period?  I told you, different bathrooms saves relationships.  We learned that years ago.  Different bathrooms completely?  Yeah.  That's odd.  Yeah.  We learned that back in the day.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  Thank you.  We got the Chris Jericho audio from BJ Shea.  Oh, cool.  You want to go down this road? 
[03:25:30]  I don't care.  I was just saying that BJ Shea is definitely a stand-up guy, man.  Well, the Chris Jericho video is getting a lot of views on YouTube and Break.com and a lot of discussion on the Chris Jericho, Jim Norton thing.  And I didn't trash him that Monday.  A week or so ago.  That Monday when we came back, I didn't bash him on the air.  Just.  No.  What's that?  Well, that's interesting.  That's the fire drill.  I'm out and outside.  Oh, there's a fire drill?  There's a fire, guys.  Don't worry.  We got everything under control. 
[03:26:00]  Just keep saying.  Learn not to burn.  Please have your attention.  Please have your attention.  Wait.  Are you shitting me?  Please disregard any signal you see or hear.  Wow.  The Jews are running out of this building.  Wait.  I thought he was one of our guys making it.  No.  This isn't a joke.  No.  Turn that up.  Ow.  Please disregard any signal you see.  We are here.  We are conducting a test in the fire of Jesus. 
[03:26:30]  It's just a test.  Come on.  Your possessions will arrive.  Yeah, we're here.  Please get on the trains.  You will be kept together when you get to the family camp.  We are asking for all your clothing to be put in one pile just in case there is a fire.  Oh, you.  I really thought that was someone fucking with us.  No, no, no.  Holy crap.  All right.  I'll beat back three. 
[03:27:00]  All right.  So here's Chris Jericho went on BJ Chase show out there in Seattle.  This is how it went down.  We just don't want another Opie and Anthony thing.  We're just trying to make sure we understand each other because I don't want to pitch you off unintentionally.  Oh, yeah.  Or intentionally like that guy.  That guy was an idiot, man.  Oh, nice.  Absolutely.  I mean, Jim Norton's a really good friend of ours.  So that's right there.  Oh, Jimmy, you're an idiot.  No, no.  But like or intentionally like right there. 
[03:27:30]  As many times as I explained, I did not know Chris Reeve was a friend of yours.  And I explained it nicely.  I said, I'm not trying to be a dick.  That's the conclusion he drew.  Fuck him.  No more Mr. Nice Guy.  I would rather have him sitting.  Seriously, I would rather say that to him while he's in the studio.  That is the conclusion he came to or intentionally.  Hey, sorry.  I'm not a part of a business where I cut my fucking head with a razor and smash people with chairs.  Sorry.  I don't have the entertainment integrity that you do in the business you're in. 
[03:28:00]  Sorry.  I don't blow myself up in a limo.  And hey, that's funny.  Again, unless, of course, you're a soldier in fucking Iraq who's been killed by a car bomb.  That's not so funny.  You want to go down that road with humor?  You will never win this argument.  Why are you yelling at me?  I'm not yelling at you.  Oh.  He really annoys me.  That guy was an idiot, man.  Absolutely.  Our problem is Jim Norton's a really good friend of ours.  So that's why we sure as heck can't go on the side.  And we think you're a good guy and you've been good to us, too.  So we're in a tough position where we've got two guys who we have a lot of respect for 
[03:28:30]  who kind of don't like each other right now.  I'll just tell them not to make paraplegic jokes and we'll be okay.  It was a quadriplegic joke, first of all.  All right?  Big difference.  And again, you see, don't make paraplegic jokes.  Okay, fine.  But in wrestling, you can...  And speaking of paraplegics, no one has ever imitated my job and smashed themselves through  a table in a backyard like backyard wrestling fans do.  No one has ever emulated what I do and hurt themselves or injured themselves terribly. 
[03:29:00]  Sucked little children's dicks.  Well, that's true.  You know.  You want to hear more of this?  I've heard it already.  It doesn't matter to me.  I was just pointing out, like, that's how he starts out.  It was just such a crazy experience.  The room just went black when all this stuff went down.  But it was fun.  That makes exciting radio.  It's better than answering the same questions over and over again.  By the way, I got a lot of respect for you because you're right.  It was great radio.  And a lot of people don't realize that. 
[03:29:30]  That, look, you know, you're doing a show.  You're entertaining people.  And like you say, you have to answer the same dumb questions all the time when you're on  tour.  And it was memorable.  And I got to be thinking that probably people who may not have wanted to come see you might  have come see you because of the whole drama.  So, yeah, BJ definitely stuck up for me in the situation, which I appreciate.  It was nice.  He didn't just side with the guy who was on the show.  Well, I think that Jimmy realized this.  Like, I was playing a part, too.  Like, we're acting and playing a character when you're doing these radio shows because 
[03:30:00]  it is fun.  I mean, you turn up the heat a bit and people get interested.  It's like, well, is this really, is he really mad?  Is he really doing this?  Like, that's why I...  See what I'm saying?  Wow.  Chris, you were mad at me.  Yeah, he was, you know, let me jump in here, Jimmy.  He was absolutely mad at you.  And then maybe somewhere, somewhere down the road, he was playing a part.  I don't know.  I'll tell you right now, he was as mad as they'd come, man.  And this is what I meant when I was talking about what pissed me off.  It wasn't that he even got mad at me. 
[03:30:30]  It was that, it's like, come on, Chris, stop saying that you're playing a part because you  had, you got, I didn't pretend I was playing a part.  I was pissed off.  But you're not playing a part.  You were angry at me.  He didn't want to come across and say that he was pissed.  Yeah.  It's like, why not just admit that you were pissed off?  It was a genuine thing.  You understand what I'm saying?  It's like, you can't have it both ways.  Oh, I was pissed off.  Oh, no.  He was an idiot for saying that, but I was playing a part.  No, you were.  Stop trying to have such control over the way you behave.  Stop it. 
[03:31:00]  You were pissed off.  It's okay.  I was like, well, is this really, is he really mad?  Is he really doing this?  Like, that's why people liked what I did, whatever it may be, wrestling or acting or with a band  or, you know, whatever it is.  You're entertaining.  It's show business.  That's all part of it.  So, am I thinking then the paraplegic line really didn't bother you?  You just thought this is how I would be bothered by it?  I'm a little confused because I really felt like you were bothered by it, but you're just  saying you were just, you know, doing some entertainment.  No, no, no.  I was bothered by it at first more than anything because I told him not to say anything about it. 
[03:31:30]  That wasn't right there, please.  Don't make a badge.  Right there, and I said this, what bothered him was that as an alpha male, he told me  not to do something and I did it.  And therein, therein lays the problem.  I did something he told me not to do.  He told you not to?  Yes.  Told me not to.  I told him not to say anything about it.  Don't say, don't make a bad joke.  Friends are friends.  He still had to say the joke.  I thought that was very disrespectful to me because I told him not to. 
[03:32:00]  I asked him not to, said that Christopher Reeve and I were friends.  See, it's right there.  I'm not even going to say he's lying.  He's probably just actually not remembering it correctly.  It was, you know, a week ago.  But I'm saying he's probably, I don't think he's intentionally being deceitful there.  He did not say, we're friends.  I said to him, why didn't you tell me?  I didn't know you were friends.  And then he just went, I told you not to.  But he's painting it like I said, hey, Jim, don't do it.  Chris and I are friends.  And you blurted the line out. 
[03:32:30]  Do you see how people remember things?  What bullshit that is?  It's bullshit.  Yeah.  I agree.  It's not the truth.  So anyways, when it first happened and when that was first said, it did kind of bother me.  But then when I said whatever I said back to Jimmy, I could tell he was bothered back.  So when he was bothered back, that's kind of when I started to stir it up a little bit more.  He would have said it and then that was it.  That's it.  Fine.  But when I mentioned what I said back and kind of could tell that his feelings were hurt, 
[03:33:00]  that the tables were turned on the, you know, the shock comedian that's not used to ever having that happen to him.  That's when I kind of started needling a little bit more.  Really?  And that's kind of where I was talking about the show.  Pause this.  Please pause this.  I'm not going to lose this fuck.  Really?  The shock comedian who's not used to going up against the wrestling brilliance of you?  Do you understand I have been fucking going back and forth with Patrice and Colin and Keith and Bobby and fucking brutal guys like that for a long time?  Do you understand that?  What do you think?  You're the first one to ever say anything unpleasant to me? 
[03:33:30]  He got you.  That's what is driving me nuts.  And the shock comedian, what was so shocking about that line?  Again, that's your perception of comedy.  I don't look at it like it's shocking at all.  You know what's shocking to me?  That you need to entertain people.  So what you do is you hide a razor blade and you slice your head.  That to me is shock entertainment.  You slice your head and then smash another human being with a chair. 
[03:34:00]  Gee, I don't know.  The shock comedian.  What's so shocking about my dumb line when you have to fucking cut your head with a razor and hit people with a chair to entertain them?  I wasn't used to being up against such a tough warrior.  Gee, I've never had that before.  Somebody say something unpleasant.  How about making a joke about paraplegics aside from being maybe in an occupation where people are made paraplegics constantly and then just thrown to the wayside when it happens?  What I'm saying, and I'm not knocking wrestling. 
[03:34:30]  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that at all.  But to have that fucking elitist attitude about something, because I said something you don't like.  When you do that to entertain people, and the way wrestling parodies everything, they make fun of everything.  They make fun of retards, the two black guys that are criminals.  They fucking goof on everything in wrestling.  Midgets?  They've been making a living teasing midgets for 25 years.  It's kind of really starting to lay it in thick.  Oh, yeah, okay.  I can tell that we had struck something that was a little bit different than the normalists. 
[03:35:00]  Let's work with it for a bit.  All right.  I think BJ finally explains your side of this to him.  But here's what I'm saying to you, Chris, because you're an entertainer, and this is where I get aggravated at people who are in the business of entertaining.  This is what Jim Norton is supposed to do, and I don't think you, if you're an entertainer, you're selling your book, you want people to interview you,  those guys have a job like we have a job, to put on entertaining radio, and I think you took it too personally.  And I think as a guy like you, who's as professional as you, as an entertainer, I think that was a mistake, because this is what Norton does, and this is what we all do to entertain. 
[03:35:30]  I mean, it was a funny joke.  It wasn't a funny joke.  It was a bad joke.  See, I disagree with that.  But comedy is comedy.  It's beauty in the eye of the beholder.  And the point is, you see, I think you were on two completely separate wavelengths here, in the fact that, I mean, you're taking a Stanford team.  I've done O&A like 10 times.  Open answer are great, great, great guys.  Three times.  I've always had some ridiculous experiences.  I've never met Jimmy Norton in my life. 
[03:36:00]  I didn't even know who he was.  I'm not saying it in a bad way.  I'm just saying, listen, when I sit down with someone, I'm coming to Open Anthony's studio as a guest of theirs.  I'm having a great time.  When he said that, it was like, well, listen, that's kind of a little bit disrespected when I said, I just said, please don't say that.  But Christian, first of all, I have, I'm not angry he didn't remember, like, because I was here the last time that he came on the show, which is fine.  I mean, he, you know, that's, he does a million interviews.  That's fine.  I mean, I don't, I'm not familiar with his wrestling either.  I know who he is, but not his career. 
[03:36:30]  But that's, the fact that you're ignorant of what goes on in the show is not my problem.  Like, you're ignorant to the day-to-day workings of the show doesn't mean I'm going to change what I do.  I don't understand where you're coming from with that.  I think BJ continues here.  I'm just telling you, Chris, to give you insight to the business, us radio guys.  I know the business, man.  But we hate it when someone comes in.  I tell you, I hate, I hate smart-ass radio DJs who think they own the damn world.  Dude, we're having a conversation and discussing things.  I don't even know, like, is Jimmy Norton, are you like his lover or something? 
[03:37:00]  What's the deal?  Now, see, now I want to see, now Chris, here's the thing.  Now, you've just taken a shot at me, and I've been very respectful to this.  You have not been.  Of course I have.  You have not been.  What have I said that's disrespectful to you?  What have I insulted about your career, about your book?  Have I said anything at all about you as a performer?  No, I have not.  Yeah, you have.  What did I say?  I don't know if I can talk to you anymore.  I mean, I don't know if I can talk to you anymore because I'm not disrespecting you at all. 
[03:37:30]  But, you know, Chris, I think you take things way too personally,  which is probably why you got into that whole thing with Norton in the first place.  Wow, bravo to my old friend BJ Shen.  BJ Shen is a nice dude, and even said to him, I respect you as an entertainer.  I think he took a two.  He's not attacking Jericho.  This is a guy who is so used to having his ass kissed and having everything he does.  He's just used to a man who's used to being listened to and dictating what other people are going to do.  Yeah, and when you pull those shenanigans, I told him. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my.  Did you fucking hear that shit?  I told him.  And then he says, I told him, me and Chris, you did not say that, dude.  And when I said you should have told me that, you said, I shouldn't have to.  That never works well with us when you say, I told you not to go down that road.  He might not have found it funny, but it was a funny joke.  And it wasn't even that rough a joke.  No.  It really wasn't.  No.  I've heard you do much worse on the subject.  We got the final clip here.  I'm done. 
[03:38:30]  Would you let me finish?  When the thing with Norm was done, Opie and Anthony were totally like, man, we love having  you.  You're a great guy.  Please come back.  That was great radio.  That was our little thing on Opie and Anthony.  You saw it on the video camera or whatever it was.  It wasn't the Jimmy Norton show.  It was the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Fair enough.  And Opie and Anthony were on my side, or not on my side, but Opie and Anthony were  very respectful, as they always have been.  Jimmy Norton, I don't know if he's a guest host on the show.  I don't know if he's on the show every day.  Is he just another guest?  He's a member of the show.  Yeah.  Okay.  But to me, I'd never seen him. 
[03:39:00]  They never explained anything.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Opie and Anthony were talking about it.  It's a different thing.  And they wouldn't say it either because they're respectful of their guest.  No.  Okay.  There's another line.  He can say whatever the hell he wants.  Okay.  There's another line.  Hey, Chris, we do have to run.  And you know what?  I think you make sure.  No, no, we do.  I mean, we have to.  But you make good points.  Another line, then.  Okay.  So it was the Opie and Anthony show.  They could say what they want.  But I thought the problem was that it was a bad joke.  So I hope somebody else can at least understand the horse shit he is spewing about this.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we should get. 
[03:39:30]  Well, that'll make a few wrestling message boards.  And then people will bash you.  Who cares?  I don't give a fuck.  I know you don't.  Then let him.  You're a trooper.  Let's go get Chris Jericho back on the phone tomorrow or Wednesday.  If he wants to come on.  Yeah.  I would love to hear that explanation.  It's the Opie.  I understand that.  It wasn't like I took over the interview.  I fuck.  I'm not a wrestling fan.  I said very little about that.  And after he.  This is what really annoys me.  And Opie and Anthony were very respectful.  Afterwards, I even talked to him.  And said, I would never have been disrespectful about your mother if I had known I was not trying 
[03:40:00]  to do that.  I was very cool with him about that.  I was not arrogant or a douchebag to him in any way, shape, or form.  But he doesn't mention that.  Look.  Sorry I didn't listen to the alpha male.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Let's say hi to Shane in Tennessee.  Shane.  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Jimmy, I don't think it was just the point of it was a bad line or anything.  Because it was a good fucking line.  The thing is, I think that he just got mad that he told you not to do it. 
[03:40:30]  The little guy smarted off to him.  What the shit he could do about it is so he got his panties in the water and he just can't  get over the fact that a smaller guy said, you know, what you did say to him.  There's no shit he can do about it.  He's not used to that.  He's a cocky fucking jock like they were in high school.  And when you smart up to him in high school, they could beat you up.  Not anymore.  This is the fucking real world.  So he can go fuck his stuff.  He's probably wrecked guys like you.  Of course he has.  Of course he has.  He's a fucking douche.  Frankus.  And the problem. 
[03:41:00]  Frankus.  And again, it was, you know, yeah, you're right.  That's exactly what it is.  He has wrecked guys like me.  Of course he has.  And he could now if he wanted to.  I'm not coming off like I'm standing up to Jericho.  Believe me, if he wanted to smack me in the face, I would shut my mouth.  I'm not an idiot.  Let's go to.  I don't want to see that.  Because I couldn't help.  I don't either.  And I wouldn't expect you to.  I would give the old, leave him alone.  I wouldn't expect you to jump in.  Let's say hi to LJ from Boston.  LJ.  Hey, what's up? 
[03:41:30]  Hey, LJ.  I was just calling about the sleep apnea thing.  I used to sleep with a guy in college that had one of those creepy fucking masks.  And what did it do for the sex life?  Nothing.  At all.  Did it hurt it?  Like, we would have sex and be like, okay,  I would go to rollover.  And then he'd be like, oh, whoops, I'm going to put my mask on.  And it was just creepy.  Like, you don't want to sleep with somebody that's hooked up to a machine.  You feel like they're sick.  Like who? 
[03:42:00]  You could describe the mask or who it might have looked like.  Oh, what?  Like Darth Vader?  See?  Oh, that's a funny one.  Yeah.  He just, I don't know.  It was just, I felt like he should have been like 80, not 22.  Yeah, I'm with LJ, man.  It just seems weird.  It is a little.  That's why I don't want to get older and all of a sudden you like freaking have a colostomy  bag or something and you're still trying to bang broads.  There's a big difference between a little mask you doze off and a shit bag that you lug 
[03:42:30]  around to events.  But I'm just saying, as you get older, there's other things that come into play.  It's like, I don't know, man.  Like, my dad has a mask and there's no way.  Like, I don't know.  I got out of that one pretty quick.  Yeah.  All right, LJ.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Crazy, crazy show today.  Than and Sam.  Rana Fez doing this on theirs?  This is kind of their storyline or what?  Sure.  It was Than and Sam versus what?  High Society?  Yeah.  Yeah, we, uh, yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah.  Well, no, I'm just asking.  Is it going to play out on their show?  Um.  Where's, uh, Bronx Johnny?  If, yeah, if they come in today, we're ready to take them on.  You never know if they're going to show up or not.  No.  Well, there was a.  That show, oh, well, there he is.  Okay.  Bronx Johnny, what's up, bro?  Hey, Pippin.  What do you got?  So the big, uh, the big showdown happened on Saturday on 2-0-2?  Yeah, we showed up.  Yeah, we did our things Saturday night, man.  Right.  That went, uh, pretty good.  Is Ron and Fez, like, playing this out on their show? 
[03:43:30]  I don't know.  I figure as such.  Because you guys did more, they did more on it on Friday, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because the deal was, like, we asked, uh, Than and Sam to come up with their five minutes  of, uh, Radio Gold, and you guys got five minutes?  Yeah, no, we're doing that right now.  All right, so it is going to play out on Ron and Fez probably later today.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Noon to three.  Oh, damn.  You beat me to it, man.  You beat me to it, noon to three.  Yeah.  Again.  That should have been the first thing you said when you sat down.  Dude, I'm so smoked up.  You should have opened with that. 
[03:44:00]  I'm so smoked out of my mind, I barely know where I'm at right now.  I wasn't going to remember that.  Are you high?  Not high.  Just enjoying shit.  Yeah.  That's how I'm looking at it.  Yeah.  Well, shout out to, uh, Jay Moore, who does, uh, his thing on Fox.  Fox Sports.  Sure.  He called your show.  He called the show up.  Yeah, he called Doug.  That felt real good, man.  Was he giving you mad props and respect?  He liked the show.  I don't know if it was respect, just he liked the show.  Take what I can get.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, Sam, not impressed. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not here to impress Sam.  I'm here to impress fans and shit.  If you go to the message boards, we got that.  Well, it all depends on which ones you go to, I guess.  You got that.  You go to basically all of them.  We took that.  Yeah?  Is that true, Sam?  No, the only message board that we go to is, uh, fanandsamfanclub.com.  We swept it, so.  Yeah.  They're pretty smart over there.  Five votes to none?  Yeah.  Sorry.  But these guys did do something pretty funny, because it started off with Fan and Sam doing 
[03:45:00]  their show, and then at the end of their show, they made it sound like, uh, the channel  was going off the air for the night before.  Yeah.  Before High Society could, like, uh, do we have that clip?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is what these guys did at the end of their show on Saturday night.  Thanks for opening, Anthony and Ron and Fez, for bringing, uh, our radio war in to the  spotlight.  Um, unfortunately, the channel is going to go dark after our show.  They have to do some maintenance on the satellites or something.  And after the performance that the High Society kids had on Ron and Fez, they didn't really 
[03:45:30]  want to go for it, so.  They lost a lot of confidence, so unfortunately, uh, there will be no audio.  Yes.  Going over this channel.  So there's probably no point staying tuned in.  But thank you for listening to us.  Thanks a lot.  And see you next time.  Thanks!  Wait for it.  This concludes Saturday Night Virus.  I thought you went with the tone.  Oh, that's horrible.  He was only on for 20 seconds. 
[03:46:00]  20 seconds.  It's long enough.  Yep.  Yeah.  I'm sure you got a few people switched right away.  Oh, you should have went for an hour.  Yeah.  Really fuck him up.  That's pretty funny.  This concludes our broadcast day.  All right, well, that's going to play out a little more on the Ron and Fez show.  Sure.  Fantasy Sam vs. High Society.  It's really their thing that they started, so, uh, tune in at noon to see how it plays out  today, okay?  All right.  Are we ready for Line of the Day?  Yes.  I don't know.  Are we?  Hope so.  Line of the Day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net, free life scoring, stats, bios, and news that 
[03:46:30]  will help you win big this season in fantasy football, all at BodogFantasy.net.  Here is a runner-up Line of the Day.  Oh, no, this one's good, too, because I got the seven.  It's 1-800-D-U-M-B-C-U-N-M-N.  Yeah.  That's seven.  N.  And that's it.  You don't need the last letter because you only need seven.  So that one's good, too. 
[03:47:00]  Exactly.  It was good.  You just, you know.  That was a good line.  Everybody was trying to figure out if it was going to get dumped out of it, I think.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  BodogFantasy.net, here's another runner-up Line of the Day.  I've heard it all before.  How many did you do last year before you decided to puke?  You're fat, stupid, irresponsible.  Your father left.  I believe it was now your father left.  Had to throw that one in, didn't you?  I didn't.  I just was heading to the list.  Yeah.  I think I'm drinking challenge, December 7th. 
[03:47:30]  Mark your calendar.  Time for Line of the Day.  Here it is.  Here it comes.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Please have your attention.  Yeah, please have your attention.  Wait, are you shooting me?  Please disregard any signal you see or hear. 
[03:48:00]  Wow, the Jews are running out of this building.  Yeah, you like that?  You like that?  Is this doing it for you?  Yeah, keep going.  Keep going.  You're going to come for me?  You're going to come for me?  Do it.  Oh, God.  Do it.  Yuck.  Do it.  He stinks of talking dirty.  Yuck.  Why is Flea's mom on the phone?  Flea's mom, what's up?  What?  Um, I just wanted to say that people don't remember what you show or know what your show is about. 
[03:48:30]  And you've done jokes on miscarriages and I've cringed and you made Jewish jokes and I cringe.  You've cringed because you should have had one.  See, I even cringe when you make fun of my son, but I have to tell you that off the air, you guys are really, really nice and people don't know that.  And we like your son.  We like Flea.  Your son.  You're not supposed to say that on the air, are you?  Nah, I see.  He's a good boy.  Nah, he's all right.  Thank you, but I just get annoyed when people like Chris Jericho or one time you had a Jewish woman ranting and raving at poor Ridge boss about things he said. 
[03:49:00]  And people just have to lighten up and know what the show is about and if they don't, switch the channel.  That's all.  All right.  I think you guys are great.  And I'm sorry I missed Joe's show on Friday, but I got stuck in traffic and I missed it.  All right.  Thanks, Flea's mom.  Hey, the new fan site, want another plug?  What is it again?  I forgot already.  It's what? 
[03:49:30]  I could save some time by saying it for him.  It's XMRadioGold.com.  Right?  New message board.  You guys are starting up.  Good luck to you.  All right?  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I guess that's it for today.  Time to go pee.  And we'll have to hang on to that.  All right.  That's a good one.  And we'll see you tomorrow.  Mañana.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho, the sexy beast of the WWE and the lead singer of Fozzy.  And this is Opie and Anthony.  Listen up, kids.  Interest in the morning.  Suppressed memory. 
[03:50:00]  Andy and Anthony.  Holy. </pre>
