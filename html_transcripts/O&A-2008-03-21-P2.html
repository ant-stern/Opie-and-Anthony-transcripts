<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a "best of the worst" comedian compilation, immediately shocking listeners with the "Two Girls, One Cup" video.  Bob Kelly was present in the studio throughout this segment. The bulk of the show then centered on *Grizzly Man*,  featuring extensive audio clips from the documentary about Timothy Treadwell.  The hosts and callers dissected Treadwell’s behavior, his relationship with the bears, and the graphic, omitted audio of his death.  Callers shared photos, some disputed as fake, and the medical examiner's report was played. The discussion transitioned to Andrew Dice Clay and his poorly-received pay-per-view special, with callers offering scathing reviews.  Dice Clay himself then called in, engaging in his characteristically abrasive and offensive stand-up routine and banter with the hosts and callers.  Further discussion of Dice Clay and more *Grizzly Man* audio concluded this segment.

Andrew Dice Clay remained a prominent guest, delivering a rambling and highly offensive stand-up routine filled with vulgar jokes targeting Kathie Lee Gifford, Cardinal O’Connor, and including highly inappropriate racist greeting cards. He interacted with callers, one suggesting a bizarre self-harm stunt.  The vulgar back-and-forth between Dice Clay and the hosts continued. Howie Mandel then joined the show, shifting the focus to his OCD and germophobia. He detailed his elaborate hygiene rituals, a horrifying potty-training anecdote involving a ravine, and his aversion to public restrooms. The hosts and Mandel joked about his quirks and his preferred fist bump greeting, before Mandel promoted his new Bravo show.

The conversation continued with Mandel's new show, focusing on hidden camera pranks, and further discussion of his OCD and germophobia.  The hosts and Mandel then discussed *The Aristocrats*, detailing various comedians' performances and their levels of profanity, including Bob Saget and John Stewart. The discussion took a dark turn with graphic descriptions of decomposition and death, prompted by Chandra Levy's case.  This led to personal anecdotes about death and its unsettling imagery. Patrice O’Neal called in, recounting a terrifying YouTube stunt with Louie C.K. involving a stolen ice cream cone and a helicopter escape, and discussed the varied reactions and surprisingly high viewership of Louie C.K.'s videos.  Anthony's own viral video was also mentioned. Carrot Top then joined the show in-studio, and the discussion shifted to his physique, prompting jokes about his muscular build.

With Carrot Top still in-studio, the hosts discussed his career, negative audience reactions, and the challenges of being a prop comic. He discussed living near Michael Jackson, his earnings, and his Bunny Ranch experiences. The conversation remained crude and vulgar, frequently targeting Carrot Top. Sandy Kane, an older burlesque dancer and alleged Phil Spector victim, then joined, contributing highly offensive and sexually explicit language, bizarre behavior including displaying a sex toy, and crude jokes.  The hosts and Carrot Top engaged with her, escalating the offensive and vulgar nature of the conversation. Pat Duffy then smelled Sandy Kane's genitalia, leading to further explicit commentary. Sandy Kane concluded her appearance by singing a crude song about Dolly Parton.

Sandy Kane remained the central focus, with the hosts and Carrot Top offering highly offensive commentary on her dancing and appearance.  Her malfunctioning microphone added to the crude jokes. The conversation veered off-topic, including discussions of Carrot Top’s Vegas shows, the Phil Spector trial (with Sandy Kane's account), and her public access show. Patrice O’Neal joined in-studio, contributing to the vulgarity.  The discussion included Clint Eastwood movies, further vulgar jokes, and concluded with Sandy Kane leaving a mess in the studio.

The show featured Richard Jeni, initially kept outside the studio and subjected to juvenile treatment by the hosts repeatedly hanging up on him.  After much teasing, Jeni came into the studio, and the hosts played tracks from his comedy CD, particularly focusing on his 9/11 material. Callers offered mixed reviews.  Ron Jeremy’s upcoming appearance was mentioned.  A significant portion involved the playing of "Two Girls, One Cup" again, and callers criticized the hosts’ treatment of Jeni. The discussion also covered Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Andrew Dice Clay, Patrice O’Neal, and John Cena.

Finally, Patrice O’Neal was interviewed. He recounted anecdotes from his WWE time, describing Vince McMahon, Triple H, The Undertaker, and Tiger Ali Singh. He discussed a disturbing beheading reenactment, his multiple firings by Stephanie McMahon, and the dynamics within WWE.  He praised other comedians (Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, Colin Quinn) and concluded with a humorous Metamucil endorsement.  The show ended with the hosts and crew talking over each other.

[00:02:00]  Let me try to look away. We have it on every screen. There's no getting away  Look at the final shot  It's based on a true story  I never saw that coming 
[00:02:30]  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show  Welcome back  To the Opie and Anthony radio program  It's the best the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show  Hey, it's Bob Kelly and you listen to the worst of Bill Burr 
[00:03:00]  Dude, dude  On the Opie and Anthony show  Billy Burr, have you seen his new haircut?  Oh my god  He should be in Philadelphia too  We got Grizzly Man audio  Bill Burr, give us the set up  Because we have new listeners  We have new listeners checking us out as he throws his stuffed animal into the garbage  Bill threw out my stuffed animal  Oh, Grizzly Man, it's about a guy of questionable sexual preference  Right  Living up in Alaska with bears with absolutely no training, wildlife training 
[00:03:30]  He just goes by gut instinct  He did it for many years and he finally got eaten alive by bears  Yeah, and then his girlfriend, his beard  Came over with a frying pan  Tried to hit the Kodiak over the head  Kodiak wasn't having it  Nope  And instead of getting the cheeseburger  He went for the quarter pounder  He ate Grizzly Man and his girlfriend  He supersized it, yeah  Supersized it  And he was a guy that wanted to be famous in Hollywood  He was up for the part in Cheers that Woody Harrelson ended up getting supposedly 
[00:04:00]  Dude, every failed actor, if they fail, they somehow came this close  This close to so close  I was supposed to be Kramer  I was this close, it was me, Kramer was right in the fucking room  The last minute he came in, I had the part  Yeah  Yeah, sure  And Bill Burr does a great Grizzly Man impression  But here's the real Grizzly Man talking about bears  I kind of think he was over ten feet high, don't you?  Oh, he's a big bear  He's a big bear 
[00:04:30]  A very big bear  Wow  Grr  Anyway, he's over here rub-a-dub-dubbing  He's a big bear  Holy crap  And I'm going to tell you, that doesn't even do it  You have to rent this movie  Because this fucking bear is ten feet tall  Rubbing its back against this tree  That if you drove into it in your fucking Hummer  You would go through the windshield and die  And this tree is like bending over  Like, get this fucking thing off me  And this gag dude is like two feet away 
[00:05:00]  Going, he's a big bear  Yes, he is  He's a big bear  And these fucking bears  Are just, they're like weirded out by the guy  It's like they're kind of full of salmon  So they don't attack him  But they just kind of  Every once in a while  They kind of snap at him  And he treats him like a dog  They get creeped out by him  You can tell  Wow  On some level, you can tell  The bears are creeped out by this guy  It's like, this guy should not be here  Does he know we can just kill him instantly?  Yeah, and what is that?  Yeah, what is it? 
[00:05:30]  Tony in Cleveland  Tony  Wow  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey  Hey, on my MySpace  And a couple months ago  I sent some pictures to Steve  There were pictures of the Grizzly guys  Attack on Ogresh  For about two weeks after it was announced  And then they had to pull him  Oh, so they are out there somewhere?  I don't even want to see the movie  Because they yanked that audio of him being killed  It's like, that's the fucking highlight of the movie  Yeah, they had the audio  And they refused to play it  Why?  A documentary  It's a documentary  They should have played that  I didn't want to see it  But they were going for a mass audience 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I've got it on my MySpace  If you look, it's got a picture of a cop standing next to just his leg  With like all the meat going  And just bone laying there  Is that really the pictures from this?  Yeah, they were on there for about a week or two  And then for some reason they jerked him off  Because the whole family, I guess, is having a fit over  All right, we're going to put you on hold  So we can go to your MySpace  If it's really good, we'll announce it to the world  Okay  All right, thanks, Tony  Hold on a second  Get his MySpace thing  It's MySpace slash Jim Norton  I didn't want to see the movie 
[00:06:30]  Because I didn't want to hear that audio  But after three minutes of watching this idiot  I wanted to see him get killed by a bear  That would have been a great finale  But they don't play it  They don't do it  It's even worse  Yeah, because the director listens to it  And then just goes  You need to burn this  Like it was a big moment about himself  Yeah, you're going to decide for everybody else  Thank you  Don't exploit this  Yeah  That I have  Yeah, as we exploit the guy  Exactly  What a fucking asshole  Oh, that pissed me off  He was just afraid it would be too graphic  To probably get mass distribution or something like that  He fucks an eight-year-old 
[00:07:00]  No one else should do this  No one should  We should burn this child now  Yes, people should not have sex with children  I saw that movie early on  And halfway through it  I realized  Oh my god  They're not  They're teasing it  But they're never going to play this audio  I was getting so pissed off in the theater  Yeah, that's why I don't want to see it  For what?  Because it's in the documentary category  You know what I mean?  Can we get the director on the phone?  I guess we can  Why not?  That'll happen  It's not a bad idea  But they did kind of sell it  Like you were going to hear the audio  Yeah, exactly  You know he's killed  You're like, alright  This will be kind of interesting to watch 
[00:07:30]  I remembered that  I remembered that  Alright, here we go  Grizzly Man talks about The Grinch  The name of one of his bears, I guess  I want to introduce you to  One of the key role players  In this year's expedition  The bear's name is The Grinch  The Grinch has come on  To be one of the more frequent bears here  In the grizzly maze  The Grinch is a female  Of about five years of age  Oh, hi, Grinch  Hi  And she has kind of an aggressive attitude  Hi  If I turn around too much 
[00:08:00]  She'll bite me  It's okay  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  Don't you do that  Don't you do that  Back off  Don't do it  It's okay  I love you  I love you 
[00:08:30]  I love you  I love you  I love you  I'm sorry  Wow  Okay, what happened there  Was the thing  Like, he fucking walks up to this thing  In the rear  I mean, I'm literally looking at it like  They're gonna show it  He's gonna get killed here  Right here  You can't believe  Actually, what you can do to a bear  What it takes for these fucking things  To attack you  The bear is looking at him like  Dude, get the fuck away from me  He's coming  Hey, here's a big bear  And he finally just went  Like this  10,000 per square inch  Lunge at this guy 
[00:09:00]  And then he starts scolding him  Like he's a fucking  Like a chihuahua  Yeah  No, no  I love you  You don't do that  And then the thing's walking away  And he's going  I love you  I love you  Maybe the bears were afraid to bite him  Because of what they might catch  Somewhere there's a bear in a robe right now  A little honey tea next to him  An 80 pound bear  I just wanted a snack  Hairless  Hairless  Hibernating in July  He's all curled up in the fetal position 
[00:09:30]  Coughing and frightened  His friends have to bring him honeycomb  All he wants is the fucking  Will and Grace box set  Are the bears protesting  To get him out of the neighborhood  One understanding deer  There is no  See, I didn't hear any of this  Or see the movie or anything  It's a comedy  You got it right  Yeah  All I've seen close to this  Are real nature documentaries 
[00:10:00]  Where there seems to be  A professional person  Who knows something about the animals  Teaching you about them  Even that stupid Australian guy  Even he like  Kind of knows something  About the animals  And how they should  And shouldn't be treated  This guy  From what I've heard so far  Has no business  Being among  Goldfish  Never mind bears  He has no clue  It doesn't seem like  He's doing anything 
[00:10:30]  That is  Benefiting our  Education of the bear  You know  What we learn about bears  This guy just decided  He's going out  With bears  Until one of them  Eat him  He just makes up shit  About nature  At one point  He's laying next to  Half a fox  Somebody  Wolves  Or something  Ripped this fox apart  That used to be  One of his pets  That he'd name  Technically  Yeah  What was his name  I don't know  What the hell 
[00:11:00]  Foxy  Yeah  This is Foxy  And he's laying there  I just don't understand  Why this has to happen  Like it's like  There's too many guns  In the neighborhood  That's the way  He's treating this shit  Another senseless killing  Yeah  I don't understand  And then the idiot  Who's making the documentary  Hits like pause  And he goes  This is where  I have to disagree  I believe wilderness  Is chaos  It's like dude  You're rationalizing  With a crazy person  Right  That dude just went like  And you were like  No I actually think  Any idiot knows  What goes on out there  Bigger animals 
[00:11:30]  Eat the littler ones  Yes  That's how it works  He did this year  After year  After year  He got crazier  And crazier  And I'm convinced  That he decided  Alright I'm gonna  Just commit suicide  By allowing one of these  Bears to eat  Bear  To eat me  Suicide by bear  And then there'll be  Video and I'll be legendary  As that voice in his head  Got louder and louder  Suck a cock  Suck a cock  I like pussy  It's a big bear  Kill me  By the way  We got reports  The audio was a little low  We got a brand new copy 
[00:12:00]  So you might want  To turn down your XM  So you don't get  That director really  Should be shot  You're right  That was probably  A personal moment for him  That everyone else  Had to fucking suffer  Because of  I know  I hated that  What a douche bag  Beck in Florida  Hey what's up guys  Hey if you can recall  During the movie  The guy had a fetish  With the bear shit  Every time he turned around  He was like caressing  And holding it  It's just  One of these movies  That's not supposed  To be a comedy  That is  Yeah  It's in my comedy section  At my house  It's hilarious 
[00:12:30]  It really is funny  On so many levels  Caddyshack  Animal house  Grizzly man  Right  Fucking  He's got a sandwich  Between Caddyshack  And Schindler's List  I forgot about that  He does start  He gets more and more  Into playing with the bear shit  That's just great  That's fantastic  He touches it  Oh yeah  Hey is there something  In there for you Jim  He's got a helpful rascal  With his  What kind of haircut 
[00:13:00]  Does he have  Like the prince  What is it called  Prince Valiant  Yeah yeah  He's got that hairdo going  It's just  It's funny  Oh you know the best part  Do you have the audio  Of the guy from LA  His ex  Actor friend out there  Who turns his death  Into like a monologue  He's like trying to  Like book an audition  You can tell  He fucking rehearsed it  This thing is  Like there's so many  Different layers  This thing's hilarious  And if I described it better  That would have been funny too  Well maybe we can get  The actor friend on the phone  We should interview  Yeah that'll happen 
[00:13:30]  Why not  They're not that big famous  No one cares about them  I don't know  Someone's saying the director's  In Munich Germany  Or something like that  Is it  Oh really  Well we have audio  They didn't highlight it  As one of the best cuts  But it is though  The director listens  To the audio of the attack  Then tells Jewel  Ex-girlfriend  To get rid of the tape  So we do have that  We'll get to that in a second  But first here's another clip  This is a helicopter pilot  That used to fly him  In and out  Would drop him off  And go  Jesus this guy's nuts  And then he'd pick him up  Like two or three months later  That long he'd be there  Yeah he was there 
[00:14:00]  For like the whole summer  I think right  Yeah he would leave  Right before they started  To hibernate  But the year he got eaten  He decided to stay longer  Knowing that more dangerous bears  Were taking the place  Of the bears that were there  That were going to hibernate  I guess there's a whole cycle  Like some bears go  Hibernate earlier  And then these really nasty ones  That can survive in worse conditions  Still hang around for another month or so  And eat everything  It's like being in midtown I guess  And then deciding one night  You're going to go uptown  How much longer 
[00:14:30]  It's kind of the same  It seems the same  You would think it would be the same  But somehow something's different  It's like walking around this area at night  Gets a little different than walking around here  A little bit  A little bit  Here we go  Here's the helicopter pilot  I think the only reason that  Treadwell lasted as long  In the game as he did  Was that the bears  Probably thought  There was something wrong with him  Like he was  Manly retarded or something  Retarded 
[00:15:00]  That bear  I think that day  Decided that he had  Either had enough  Of Tim Treadwell  Or  That something clicked  In that bear's head  That he thought  Hey you know  He might be good to eat  I think that's closer to it  My opinion  I think  Treadwell thought  These bears  Were big  Scary looking  Harmless creatures  That he could go up  And pet 
[00:15:30]  And sing to  And they would  Look at that  Bond as  Children of the universe  Or some odd  I think  He had lost sight  Of what was really going on  Broke back  Yeah  That's the same  This guy's fucking  Rationalizing it  Like the bear  Maybe it was a political argument  Maybe that's why he killed him  You fucking idiot  I'm Tim Treadwell  Get to the chopper  He had a falling out  With the bears  The bears thought he was retarded  The bears thought he was retarded 
[00:16:00]  And said  I've had enough of this guy  Or  He thought  That's a tasty treat  The bear  I'll go with the tasty treat  I think the bear  Just looked  He was hungry  And bears will eat anything  They're stupid bears  They have video of the bear  That ate him  They're convinced  That he actually taped him  Yeah  And you could just see it  They make this point in the movie  You could just see it in the bear's eyes  That there was just a  I just need to eat look  Hungry bear  He was an older bear  And all the younger ones  Ate all the salmon  And this douche bag  Was standing there  He's a big bear  Old bear 
[00:16:30]  Can't hunt anymore  Probably  Then an expert  Looking at the footage  And this Tim guy  Is watching this bear  Dive really deep  And Tim thinks it's great  That the bear  Could dive that deep  And it's so cute and stuff  And the expert's like  That's not cute  That's proven that this bear  Is beyond hungry  And is going really deep down  To try to get food  You ever see the cute picture  Of the bear sitting down  By the waterfall  And he just puts his hand in  And his salmon's on his claw  And he eats it  Puts another one  If bears gotta work for anything  Right 
[00:17:00]  Yeah they must be hungry  That's what the expert explains  Like you know  He has to work real hard  To survive at this point  It's not like you know  The height of the salmon season  Where you just scoop up  As many as you can  Yeah and what's funny  When you look at the footage  Of the bear  It literally looks like  The bear's playing  It's a scene right out of Bambi  Because he's diving deep  And then coming back  On his back  And if you knew nothing  About these animals  Like I don't  I was like laughing  Go ahead look at him  How cute  He's swimming  Swimming  He's just taking a break  He's starving  He's doing the  Yeah he's diving down deep 
[00:17:30]  Because there's no  Fucking fish left  And he keeps coming up  And he's occasionally  Glancing over at this idiot  I could eat that I think  I think I could eat that  Another step closer  It's like finding a chick  In the neighborhood  Who sucks your dick immediately  The bear's probably like  I heard about this asshole  I can't believe he's really here  This guy's for real  I thought this was a goof  An urban legend  Do you hear about the guy  That just hangs around  He doesn't run away  When you walk up to him  No he just talks  No he talks to you  It's a set up man  I don't like it 
[00:18:00]  Who did this Danny or you  Danny  The description on the next track  Is hilarious  Hello bear  Why don't you take a seat  Right over there  What were you thinking  When you came over  To this guy's camp  I don't know  Track seven  Sorry  Listen to this  Spirit the fox's cub ghost  Takes Tim's hat  And runs off  What results can only be  Described as fag mad  And could be the most  Hilarious audio ever recorded  Fag mad  The hat ends up in a den  But Danny's saying  This could be the most  Hilarious audio ever 
[00:18:30]  Ever recorded Anthony  Alright  Ever  Hey who's stealing that hat  Let me see that hat  Ghost I want that hat  Man  Ghost is bad  Ghost what are you doing  With that hat  Ghost  That hat is a very  Important hat  Drop it  Hags  Oh god damn it  I can't believe this

[00:20:00]  Here's the next track  Tim petting and talking  To Timmy the fox  Timmy  And then he asked the public  To stop killing  And hurting foxes  Do you know anyone  That kills and hurts foxes  Um  I know nobody  That does that  Bill you  No  You know what  I've never heard of it  I've never  You know  Tally ho  We get up on horseback  And send the hounds out  Chase that fox  Go on a fox trot  Fox hunt 
[00:20:30]  How often do you  How often do you  Call your friends  I'll leave a message  We're out hurting a fox  Call you back  It's a different perspective  I do believe  Yeah  How many foxes  Could be hurt out there  Only Timmy is the boss  Of all foxes  And all bears  You're the ruler  Look at that face  Look at that ear  Yay  Thanks for being my friend  This is so good  Does it feel good  We patrol the grizzly sanctuary together 
[00:21:00]  How did we meet  Over a decade ago  He left his mother and father's side  Promptly peed on my shoes  Pooped on my clothes  That was it  He was my friend  Timmy the fox  Yep  And we watch over things  And he's the boss  Takes care of everything  Yep  Yep  Yes I love my head  I think one of the things  That's really important  Is you can see the bond  That has developed  Between this very wild animal  And this very  Fairly wild person 
[00:21:30]  And you realize  He has this gorgeous fur  And people are trying  To kill him for it  With steel jaw traps  And cruel farming practices  And other people  Run him down on horses  For a sport  Fox hunting  We want this to end  Between Timmy the fox  This beautiful fox  And me  We ask the public  Please  Stop killing  And hurting these foxes  And torturing them  Don't you think  Yeah  If they knew how beautiful he was  And how sweet he was  They would never hurt him  Thanks King 
[00:22:00]  Holy shit  Too bad  Two bears didn't do  An infomercial  Please stop eating  Psychotic faggots  Please just let them  Wander around your neighborhood  Without being harmed  And eaten  I like how they're playing  That acoustic guitar music  Like they're so trying  To get you to give a fuck  About this guy  He had a good heart  Yeah he meant well  Yeah we're all too jaded  He meant well 
[00:22:30]  I like this next track  Because he loses his mind  Because he's talking to the camera  And it's not coming out right  So he does the lines  Over and over again  And he gets madder and madder  Listen to this  Timothy used his camera  As a tool  To get his message across  Sometimes his approach  Was very playful  Do another take here  I fucked up the last one  I almost just fell off the cliff  I'm a fucking asshole  Behind me is the grizzly sanctuary  And also behind me  Hidden down below  In those trees  Somewhere  Is my camp 
[00:23:00]  I must stay incognito  I must hide from the authorities  I must hide from people  Who would harm me  I must now even hide  From people that seek me out  Because I've made some sort of  I don't want to say celebrity  But they come here to Alaska  And they hear about Treadwell  In the bush  And they want to go find him  But they can't  I'm hidden down below  No one knows where I am  Even I don't even know where I am  That was pretty shitty  Let's do a really short take here  But as a filmmaker 
[00:23:30]  He was methodical  Whatever  Often repeating takes 15 times  One more really short  Excellent take  Let's just really sum it up  Here we go  This is going to be the motherfucker  Behind me is the grizzly sanctuary  And also hidden down below  Is my camp  For I must now remain hidden  From the authorities  From people who would harm me  For I must now  From people who would seek me out  As a story  My future  Hoping the end  Depends on it  I must be a spirit  In the wilderness  He's methodical 
[00:24:00]  As a director  He's kind of like Kubrick  But without limbs  I'm a shithead  Rachel  My camp is down there  Someday it will all be yours  The Peloponies  My mutilated body  What is a string of intestines  Rachel  You've hit him over the head  With a frying pan  If there 
[00:24:30]  I have no idea  If there's a god  But if there's a god  God would be very  Very pleased with me  If you could just watch me here  How much I love them  How much I adore them  How respectful I am to them  How I am one of them  And how the studies they give me  The photographs  The video  And take that around  For no charge  To people around the world  It's good work  I feel good about it  I feel good about myself doing it  And I want to continue  And I hope I can  I really hope I can 
[00:25:00]  But if not  Be warned  I will die for these animals  I will die for these animals  I will die for these animals  Thank you so much  For letting me do this  Thank you so much  For these animals  For giving me a life  I had no life  Now I have a life  Thank you so much  For getting killed  That faggot eating bear  Does not get that picture  Foraging lessons  Salmon eating lessons  I was going to make him 
[00:25:30]  A producer  For foundry music  Danny didn't highlight  This track  But I think we should play  Because it says  This is the cut  Where Tim wonders  Why girls don't want  To be with him  Let's see what he has  To say about this  Because you're gay  And you smell like bear shit  And that's my story here  For me  Timothy Treadwell  The kind warrior  The kind warrior 
[00:26:00]  Can I take it?  I'm trying  Okay, yeah  I can do it  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Across the halfway point  Government's given me  All they have  So far  I've stood up to it  I've had danger  In the boat  I almost died  I've almost fallen off a cliff  Yeah  The danger factor  Is about to amp up  In the maze  This maze is always  The most dangerous  Lord, I do not 
[00:26:30]  Want to be hurt by a bear  I do not  I always cannot understand  Why girls don't  Want to be with me  For a long time  Because I have  Really a nice personality  I'm fun  I'm very, very good  In the  Well, you're not  Supposed to say that  When you're a guy  But I know I am  They know I am  And  I don't fight with them  I'm so passive  Bit of a patsy  Which is that 
[00:27:00]  A turn off to girls  To be a patsy  I mean it's not  It's not that I'm a  Total great guy  That means faggot  I'm a lot of fun  And have a good life  Going  I don't know  What's going on  I always wished  I was gay  It would have been  A lot easier  You know  You can just  Bing, bing, bing  You guys  Have no problem  I mean they go to  Restrooms and truck stops  And perform sex  It's like so easy  For them  And stuff  But you know what  Alas  Timmy Turner  Was not gay 
[00:27:30]  Bummer  I love girls  Girls  Girls need a lot more  Need a lot more  Hold on  I gotta back up  Yeah  Yeah  That guy  Is trying a little too hard  Hold on  Let's back up here  A little bit  No problem  I mean they go to  Restrooms and truck stops  And they  Perform sex  It's like so easy  For them  And stuff  But you know what  Alas  Timmy Turner  Was not gay  Bummer  I love girls 
[00:28:00]  Girls  You're a fucking liar  You need a lot more  You know  Finesse  And  Care  And  And I like that a bit  But when it goes  Bed down  And bed  And you're  Alone  It's like  Well  You know  You can't rebound  Like you can  If you were gay  I'm sure gay people  Have problems too  But  You want to kiss me  One goofy straight guy  I'm Timothy Treadwell 
[00:28:30]  Anyway that's my story  That's my story  He's like  Oh what a shame  I'm not gay  Yeah  Oh boy  I'd like to be  But  My girls  Let's go to Eric  In New York  Eric  Rachel  I've become  Bear  Hoodoovers  Hoodoovers  Or  Derbs  Nasty boss  Mr. Marshall  Good one Eric  Well here's Tim  Talking to a fox 
[00:29:00]  We're almost done here  The Grizzly Man  Audio  I love you  Look at you  You're the best  Little fox  But how did I  How did I come  Into this work  Iris  Did you ever  Did you ever  Get the story  I was  I was troubled  I was troubled  I drank a lot  Did you know that  Iris  You wouldn't even  Know what that is  But  I used to drink  To the point  Of  That I guess  I was either  Gonna die from it  Or  Or break free of it 
[00:29:30]  But nothing  Nothing Iris  Could get me  From  To stop drinking  Nothing  I went to programs  I tried quitting myself  I did everything  That I could  To try not to drink  And then I did  Everything I could  To drink  From the mule  He means  And it was killing me  Until I discovered  This land of bears  And realized  That they were in  Such  Such great danger  That they  They needed a caretaker  They needed someone  To look after them  But not a drunk person  Not a person messed up  So I promised 
[00:30:00]  The bears  That if I would  Look over them  Would they  Please help me  Be a better person  And  They become  So inspirational  Thought he said  A deader person  And living with the foxes too  That I did  I gave up the drinking  It was a miracle  It was an absolute miracle  And the miracle  Was animals  The miracle  Was animals  Sex with them  Guaranteed  This guy fucked something  An animal  One of the foxes  A bear 
[00:30:30]  Something  I gotta say  This is what's impressive  You saw the pictures  Yeah  One of them  He's sitting behind a bear  This bear is fucking massive  I don't think  That's not the guy  That's him  And this one  Has been disputed  They're fake photos  This is a fake photo  The other one  Isn't a fake photo  It's a real dead guy  This isn't  But it isn't the guy  That's not the guy  I don't know  If this is him  But there's a picture  Of a guy's leg  That has been shredded off  And his fucking hog  Is hanging out  By his intestines  And he's gotta be  Packing seven soft  And I'm like 
[00:31:00]  In a panic mode  Your cock shrivels  So for this guy  To fucking have a dick  This big  After being attacked  By an animal  Hats off  And the animals  Even know  Not to eat the taints  Look at that  It's completely intact  So this is not him  No that's some other  Animal attack  Why would the bear  Leave the best part  Maybe the bear  Just sucked it  And walked away  I thought this whole  Thing was bullshit  I like how his thigh  Is completely gone  But his shin is there  And his sneaker  Is still nicely tied  On his foot  And his leg  Is kind of almost  In relaxed mode  Like he's sunbathing 
[00:31:30]  Yeah like he's  Kicking his leg up  A little bit  But the audio  Pictures are fake  They're definitely fake  Those aren't the ones  No that's not the guy  So you guys want to hear  From the medical examiner  We got two clips left  Yes  Oh this guy  Everybody  This guy was a creep  In the movie  Yeah you ever see a movie  Where it's just  Everybody's good  And then they all go on  To be like stars of movies  As an occasional  This fucking documentary  Is like that  There's not a B-list person  In this  Did you ever see the movie  We gotta get the audio  Of 
[00:32:00]  They made it  Kind of a loosely  Based documentary  I guess it's a documentary  On the death of Kurt Cobain  Oh yeah  That came out  About seven  Eight years ago  Kurt and Courtney  I don't know what it was  Was it called  Kurt and Courtney  The one that said  That she was involved  In the plotting  Yeah that she got a hitman  To kill Kurt Cobain  And stuff  Yeah that was it  And they finally find this guy  And he had a really scary name  And this guy couldn't kill  A mosquito  I gotta get the audio of that  What was that guy's name  In that movie  I don't remember 
[00:32:30]  And then like after  Like a month or two  After filming  He was run over by a train  He was like a raging  Alcoholic  That was in some obscure  Like punk band  In Seattle or something  It was hilarious  Another movie  That was hilarious  Yeah not trying to be  Harder than it was  Remember when he was  Driving in the car  And he goes  Right here we were  Going to use some audio  From Nirvana  But Courtney wouldn't let us  Yeah yeah yeah  No what about  Oh you did see the movie  Yeah and he left that  In the movie  So it was these two  Like bumbling idiots  They're like trying to  Like prove that 
[00:33:00]  Courtney killed Kurt  Right and now  It's the moment  That they've been waiting  For on film  Their cameras are rolling  They finally got Courtney  They only have her  For like a couple seconds  And then all of a sudden  The screen goes blank  And all of a sudden  There's a voiceover  Going  Unfortunately at this point  Our battery ran out  Yeah  I remember that scene  Nice professional work  Another one of those movies  So worth renting  Because it's so silly  And funny  Ah I forgot about that  I remember laughing  In the movie theater 
[00:33:30]  And these people in front  Were evidently like  Big Nirvana fans  Oh dude once again  And they would turn around  And go like  Dude  I'm like this is pathetic  I saw the movie in Cambridge  And a huge Nirvana fan  Most people know that  I was openly laughing  But there were people  In this theater  Like you just said  Taking this movie  Like it was  It was the real deal  Alright  Here's a medical examiner  He had examined the bodies  After the bears  A good old Tim  And his girlfriend  Alright  Here's  Girlfriend 
[00:34:00]  Timothy Treadwell  And Amy Hooganaut's remains  Came in this large metal can  Inside this metal can  Was a plastic bag  One for Timothy  And one for Amy  I mean these are human beings  And the question I ask is  First of all  Who are you Timothy  Who are you Amy  And what happened to you  I don't think you'll get an answer  In the case of Timothy and Amy  What I had were body parts  Just the visual input 
[00:34:30]  Of seeing a detached human being  Before my eyes  Makes my cock hard  Makes my heart  That's what I was going to say  The guy  Yeah he sounds a little into it  You know what you couldn't tell  In the beginning  Is he has these big silver crates  And he's like  Timothy and whatever her name was  And his hose bag  Came here  And these crates  And he  Wham  Slams down  And there's this big creepy echo  Yeah  Yeah  He just looks like he's way into death  Like  Way into it  He gets to bed  Examiner  Why does he act like he's never seen a fucking 
[00:35:00]  No he gets really into describing the  What happened to these people  That's coming up  From my eyes  Makes my heart race  Makes the hair stand up on the back of my head  Makes the blood flow  Particularly in combination with the contents of a tape  An audio tape  That is the sound portion of a video tape  And when I find out from other investigators  That the shoes neatly placed at the entrance to a tent  And the cap left on a camera  So that the visual part could not be recorded 
[00:35:30]  Yet the tape is running  So that we can hear the sounds  Of Amy screaming  And the sounds of Timothy moaning  Tells me that this event occurred very very quickly  Suddenly and unexpectedly  I clearly can hear her screaming  Stop and go away  Maybe run away  There's a lot of background noise  Timothy is moaning  And I hear Amy beating 
[00:36:00]  On the top of this bear's head  With a frying pan  And Timothy is saying  Run away  Let go  Run away  Run away Amy  Run away  Amy had a great deal of conviction  She had a great deal of conviction  In this relationship  We know that  Although in the past  She was more standoffish  She didn't get as close to the bear  As Timothy did  She was more cautious 
[00:36:30]  However I know  That at the moment of death  When one is being tried  To the maximum of one's ability  To be faithful  To stick to a situation  To be loyal  If one can say that to Timothy  She stayed there  And she fought with Timothy  She did not run away  Amy  We know  Fought back  For approximately six minutes  Amy stayed  With 
[00:37:00]  Her lover  With  Her partner  With her mate  And with the bear  Ultimately  She stayed  With the bear  In the situation  Definitely  Definitely  Definitely a James Blunt moment  Right there for her  Where was she going to fucking run to?  You're in the woods  With a bunch of bears  Where are you going?  Where's the audio of him  Explaining the injuries?  You just slowly sort of walk away  Like  Alright Tim 
[00:37:30]  Yeah  Take it easy  It's the way you kind of  Wanted to go out  It's not the way I want to go  So I'm going to be leaving  I know  She's like  You haven't fucked me in years  He wouldn't have to tell me  To run away  He would have been like  Run away  Where are you?  Here's  Pop a smoke  Where you used to be  Here's the director  Or the main guy  Listening to the actual audio  I like his  Of him being eaten alive  And his girlfriend  Go ahead  I like just his brutal  Like reenactment  Of what they were saying  And he was like  Run away  Run away 
[00:38:00]  It was more like  Run away  Yeah  Run away  But at this point  There was a lot of  Background noise  Yeah  It wasn't one of those  Quiet getting eaten alive moments  Wasn't mixed well  They really didn't have  Good mic placement  This is the big bummer  Of the whole movie  Because they didn't  Play the audio  But this guy  You get to watch him  Listen to the audio  With headphones on  He gets to hear  We can't  So there might be  Some dead space in here  As he's listening to the audio  I don't know  This is Timothy's camera 
[00:38:30]  During the fatal attack  There was no time  To remove the lens cap  Jewel Pallovac  Allowed me to listen  To the audio  I hear rain  And I hear Amy  Get away  Get away  Go away  Yeah  He's listening  He's still listening 
[00:39:00]  Grr  Grr  He's listening  Grr  Grr  And  No no no no no no  And he's listening  No no no no no no  Grr  He continues to listen  Can I turn it off  Grr  No no no no no no  He's still listening  Grr  Grr  More listening  I bring nothing to the table  Huh  Where did that come from  Grr  As he continues to listen 
[00:39:30]  Is he laughing  True  You must never listen to this  I know  I'm never going to  And you must never look at the photos  That I've seen at the coroner's office  I will never look at them  Yeah  Yeah  Chicken  Lichen  And you must never look at the photos  While listening to the audio  Now you know why 
[00:40:00]  No one's going to hear it  I think you  You should not keep it  You should destroy it  Yeah  Thank you  I think that's what you should do  Yeah  Okay  Because it will be the white elephant  In your room  All your life  She was later killed by a white elephant  Which is odd  Coincidence of that situation  You must burn it 
[00:40:30]  You must dig a long ditch  And get the people to load them in  And cover them with kerosene  And burn them  So we are not  Our crimes will not be  Oh  The tape  Burn the tape  You should never listen to this  While looking at those pictures  While having your ass eaten on a bear rug  Near a fireplace  Freep  Cockblock Nazi  What did the girlfriend look like?  Oof  She looked like she could have been  In the woods  Being filmed  The kind of girl 
[00:41:00]  That had to give him  The benefit of the doubt  Yeah  Exactly  Also known as a fag hag  Fag hag  Fag bear hag  Wow  What year was this?  A few years ago I guess  I don't know  Something like that  Did the audio still exist?  I think there's got to be more than one copy  Had to get out there somewhere  The cops  They always do  Ah the cops  Hey  Check this one  The cops for the Christmas party  You gotta think  Murphy ran off the tape  Look  Yeah  All the shit they've seen  They like eating lasagna  It doesn't buck them  Right  Well I'm making an offer 
[00:41:30]  $25 to whoever produces that audio  Wow  Holy Jesus  That's a lot of money  And tickets to my February 24th  25th Albany shows  Wow  That's right  I don't think the listeners  Will be sending an audio  Of a bear eating somebody  $25  Alright  You owe me  Grr  Grr  Grr  Grr  Grr  Listen to the panty sounds  Grr 
[00:42:00]  That's him ripping the flesh off  The bear's body  Grr  Grr  Grr  Grr  Grr  Alright we'll leave  With one last clip here  From Tim  Talking to the bears  Well I just want to discuss  That fight with  With Mickey Bear right here  He's right  Oh yeah  He got on film  A crazy fight  Between two bears  A very violent  Violent fight  That was a lot of fun  To check out  In the background  Two heavyweights  And he's about 50 feet away  From what just happened  Well I just want to discuss  That fight with 
[00:42:30]  With Mickey Bear right here  He's right next to me  Here in the Grizzly Sanctuary  On the Tide Flat  Saturn  Off to camera left  Mick  You underestimated Sergeant Brown  You went in for the hit  He seemed to be rope-a-doping you  Like he wasn't that tough  And then once you  You banged into him  Down go straight  Man he turned out to be  One heck of a rough bear  A very rough bear  And I'm telling you  I was so scared  I almost got sick to my stomach  Watching you fight  And then when he knocked you down  And you had him  And you were down on your back  It was terrible  It was terrible 
[00:43:00]  You can't win Ron  I'm not duking it out  For any girl like that  I'm telling you right now  I'm not duking it out  For any girl  But I  You know  I've had my troubles  With the girls  Yeah  And I'll tell you something  If Saturn was a female human  I could just see  How beautiful she is  As a bear  I've always called her  The Michelle Pfeiffer  Of bears out here  Michelle Pfeiffer  Alright  You lay there  I'm gonna go off  With your girlfriend  Don't beat me up over it  I'm  I'm cool  Even the bag knows he's gay  Things are bad for me

[00:44:00]  He's not gay  It's why he was drinking  It would be better  To be gay  Finally he's attacked  By some fucking  Bear in skinhead boots  That doesn't approve  Of his lifestyle  That's a little taste  The movie is just  Terrific  A little taste  That's funny  A little taste  Michelle Pfeiffer  Michelle Pfeiffer  What's that call her  Before we go to break  The first half of that  Whole clip CD you played  I thought it was still  Mario Cantone's  Grammy commentary

[00:54:30]  Look, I think I'm dying over here.  Yeah, I'll riff on the paper.  Okay.  You see the stock market yesterday?  Uh, yeah.  It plunged 374 points.  I got a chick.  She plunged on me.  Hey, gee.  See, that's topical.  I'm just riffing on the noose.  Okay.  All right, another story.  What do we got here?  Hey, gee, gee.  Would you like me to give you one, maybe? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I can't read.  I just figured this out.  Hey, you know what I found out?  These screensavers are amazing.  I ain't never seen one.  All of a sudden, the computer's making pictures.  I'm like, hey, gee.  Well, people are calling in with reviews of your show last night, dice.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's going on?  How's it going, ONA?  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing, Rob?  Whatever the hell your name is, take off.  All right, I checked out your pay-per-view last night. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, thank you.  Hey, funny stuff, right?  Yeah, it sucked.  Hey, what are you talking about?  It looked like you shot.  It looks like I've seen amateur porn that looks better than that.  Yeah, with your mother in it.  See, I came back out of there.  Hey, good callback.  You like that?  Yeah, very good, dice.  I was watching 10 minutes into it.  I turned on Friends.  It was friggin' terrible.  It was a piece of crap.  Dice, he turned you off for Friends.  Hey, you see that show Friends?  Yeah.  Hey, what's with that Chandler?  What kind of name is Chandler? 
[00:56:00]  Oh!  That's all you got on one of the hottest shows of our time?  Hey, I don't feel too good.  Look, I think I'm having a heart attack.  I'm dying over here.  All right, listen, why don't you talk about Hillary's new hairdo?  Hey, you see Hillary's new hairdo?  That's a big story here in New York as she makes her Senate run.  A little makeover for Hillary.  So she got the hair on top of her head done?  Yeah.  You think she fixed her c**t?  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh! 
[00:56:30]  Wait a minute, dice.  Hello!  You can't say that.  Hey, did you have to dump out?  Yeah, we had to dump out.  Hey, they're screaming on the phones.  Wow, let's see if they heard that on the phones.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I saw the dice thing last night.  The guy sucked.  I think that, you know...  Like your mother sucks, Jack.  Hey, Jack, what's your last name?  Ass?  Jackass.  Look, I put two words together, and I make them look like a jackass.  Oh!  Hey, dice, I think it said kick me on the back of your jacket. 
[00:57:00]  I think they got the bedazzler, and they put that kick me in my fat ass.  Hey, let's see you do a pay-per-view, jackass.  Okay?  Let's see you.  Hey, dice, can you say anything other than jackass?  Yeah, ass jack.  You're an ass jack.  See, I can turn it around.  Hey, why are you hanging up on our listeners, dice?  I don't want to talk to him. 
[00:57:30]  Why?  Because he's a jackass.  Was he getting the best of you or something?  No one gets the best of the dice, man.  Let's go to Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  Yeah, the Dices show was a new one Friday night.  It was on Friday.  A new one?  Yeah, the one that was on last night.  Hey, shut up and let me talk.  So you were laughing, right?  Yeah, I was laughing.  You thought it was hysterical?  Yeah, the second time around.  What was that supposed to mean, Jake?  You're a jackass.  I mean, it sucked.  What are you, dice now, Kirsten?  He said that for it, Opie. 
[00:58:00]  You gotta be on the button.  Like the dice man.  I'm up to date.  Look, Kathie Lee leaving the show.  Yeah.  You ever see her with the can sagging?  Yeah, she doesn't wear a bra.  Oh!  That's all you got on that.  Well, she's the gigging, I'm going to get you a bunch of love.  And Regis with his millionaire show.  Yeah, who wants to be a millionaire?  Who wants to be?  The guy, I got millions of dollars for when I sold out like the garden. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Oh!  Put me in the hot seat.  I'm dying over here.  Who wants to be a washed up comic?  Is that the name of your new show?  Hey, Farmer.  Yeah.  Hey, how about Cardinal Ocana?  How about him?  He's going to be retiring soon.  Hey, he looks like a marshmallow with a big hat.  Come on, that's funny.  That's almost there.  Sure.  I surprised myself.  I'm laughing at that one.  A marshmallow with a big hat.  All right, well.  Oh!  Marshmallow with a big hat, Opie. 
[00:59:00]  Right, listen.  Hey, see, Cardinal Ocana?  Yeah.  He looks like a big melted marshmallow.  See, now I changed it up a bit.  I'm topical.  Hey!  You're riffing.  John has a short poem for you.  John?  Hey, Opie.  Hey there, Dice.  Hey.  Hey, John.  This is B-Rack, okay?  Roses are red, violets are blue.  No one under 18 has ever heard of you.  Hey, can I use that?  Oh, sure.  I'm putting that in the act.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Hey, John.  Bye.  Say this.  I mean, you can't get me to drink about a personality. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, you can't get me to get you out of a personality.  I'm dying over here.  Hey, John.  John.  You see Cardinal Ocana?  Yeah.  He looks like a melted marshmallow with a pulp hat.  Uh, that's kind of funny.  I guess.  Wow.  John.  Dice is working it here.  You can laugh at at least one of his jokes.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  Hey, I understand.  I'll give you a half a heart.  Uh, TK from Long Island. 
[01:00:00]  Dice should get the pipe to see if there's any remnants of his career in there.  I'm still hot.  Look, they did a pay-per-view.  Yeah.  I think someone in pay-per-view screwed up and put the wrong reel on.  What was that?  The outtakes?  It was supposed to be Steel Magnolias or something.  This guy says you look like the Fonz on your pay-per-view.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you.  Hey, the Fonz is cool.  No, it looked like a 60-year-old Fonzie with a sequins jacket.  The same old cigarettes. 
[01:00:30]  Stupid thing.  It's over.  See, I do the thing where I come out on stage and I light a cigarette.  I'm telling you, you should take Fonzie's place.  Hey, sit on it, Patsy.  Okay?  Sit on it.  Hey!  So you look like the Fonz now, huh?  That's what I'm going for.  Like a cross between the Fonz and Vinnie Barbarino with a cigarette.  Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Hey!  Cunningham in my office.  Oh!  See, I'm going for the Fonzie thing. 
[01:01:00]  I still come out on the stage.  Yeah.  I look all cool.  Oh, yeah.  I light a cigarette.  Oh, sure.  And then I have a heart attack.  I have to go.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  Can you say that?  Take off.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.  Hey, you see Cardinal O'Connor?  Yeah, you did the Cardinal O'Connor joke.  It's a new one.  It is?  Yeah.  Okay.  It looks like a pillow with a quote pad on. 
[01:01:30]  It's topical.  Hey, did you see HBO's If These Walls Could Talk?  Oh, they got with the dykes.  Yeah, you must have some good material on that.  Yeah, Ellen DeGeneres, right?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  She chews a rug.  Right.  Oh!  That's all you got.  Oh!  Sharon Stone.  Yeah.  With the, uh...  She's got, like, cans.  Yeah, she does.  And Ellen was playing with him.  Yeah, she was.  Oh!  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:00]  I'm dying, over here.  I know you are.  Make your back in the personnel.  All right, we'll take one more call for you, Dice, okay?  Anthony, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Dice.  Yeah.  You are done.  Hey, thank you.  You are so done.  Is that a new hip term the kids are using?  Done?  That means, like, you're hot, right?  Let me ask you something.  When people say, hey, Dice, you're fat.  That means good, right?  So I'm done.  What was that deal with those cards you wrote last night? 
[01:02:30]  He had these cards.  Oh, it's the new act.  I got it.  See, instead of rhymes, I'm doing greeting cards.  You couldn't even read it.  Yeah, let me do one.  You could.  Uh, this one would be for a chick for Valentine's Day.  It says, happy Valentine's Day, you freaking whore.  See, that's funny, right?  Look, you're laughing.  He had nothing better.  Here's another one.  A personal Christmas card for Christmas.  Merry Christmas, you freaking whore.  See?  And then I got an alteration one on a birthday. 
[01:03:00]  Happy birthday, you fat bitch.  Hey, ye.  See, this is funny.  It's a new twist on the rhymes.  Uh, Dice, we got the Olive Garden on the line.  They want to, uh...  I'm dying over here.  They want to book you.  Is the Olive Garden on the line?  Yeah, Dice, how you doing?  Hey, well, this isn't exactly the garden I'm looking for.  Yeah, this is Mike from the Olive Garden, Dice.  What's going on?  What can I do for you, Jake-off?  I want to know if you can sell out a table of five.  Table of five?  I got some hospitality, I know. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I saw you the other day at, uh, Laugh to Your Crap Your Pants in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Yeah, and then I'm playing at, uh, at Shake Your Balls Loose.  Dice and the Ha-Has and the Comedy Toilet.  Oh!  And Ha-Ha just left.  My career's rolling.  All right, Olive Garden, thank you.  All right.  And finally, Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I think Dice, I have a great idea for Dice, you know, how he can improve his act.  Yeah.  I say, I say you put a cigarette in your ass on stage. 
[01:04:00]  All right, I'm still with him.  Don't laugh.  If this will get the career back, I mean, you're not going to get your personal.  Yeah, by the way, I figured out what that means, that guy's going to get the personal.  Yeah.  I think you're having a stroke, you freaking fat loser.  I could be.  Look, I'm dying over here.  Smoke another cigarette, you fat loser.  You have a greeting card for this guy, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I know it's your birthday and you want the case, but not until you show me your case.  All right? 
[01:04:30]  I got a greeting card for Dice.  Yeah.  My deepest sympathy on the loss of your pathetic career, you fat sow.  Hey, can I use that?  Jack.  It's the only original thing you've ever had.  Hey, your name's Jack.  Jack off.  Look, I got him, right?  I nailed you.  I nailed you when you know it.  Your name's Jack.  I called you Jack off.  Look.  Oh, I got you.  I got a good one.  What are you, a chink?  Are you a chink?  Look, I'm racist now.  Hey, hey, chink.  Hey, Jack. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, Jack.  Jack off.  Look, I'm still banging you.  Hey, hey, I got a new one for you.  Off Jack.  Hey, hey, that's good.  I like this guy.  You want to come to Vegas with me?  You can open up and make a congregation of personal.  I'm dying over here.  Hey, Jack off.  All right.  I'm Jack.  All right, Jack.  I'm going to use the cigarette in the ass, though.  I like that.  That's the only way you'd be entertaining, you fat loser. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, what are you hanging up on it for, Dice?  I don't want to talk to nobody that's going to be railing me.  Hey, I got some more cards.  All right.  Here's one for Mother's Day.  Okay.  Hey, Mom.  Happy Mother's Day, you freaking whore.  Okay?  See, you're laughing.  It's just topical funny stuff.  How about this one?  Happy Groundhog's Day.  I hope it crawls in your ass.  Okay?  Hey, how you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personnel.  I mean, you've got personnel. 
[01:06:00]  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma.  Okay, terrific.  Pharma.  Pharma.  See?  You play my promos all the time.  Yeah.  We love you.  Pharma.  We still love you, Dice.  You've got to leave us with another greeting card.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  Yeah.  Your daughter's a dyke and your father's a queer.  Okay?  All right? 
[01:06:30]  See?  I got to leave on a high note.  Yeah.  That's not bad, right?  You're onto something.  How about that?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're listening.  No, not Anthony Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're listening to Hopi and the guy that wants to be me show on WNEW 102.7.  Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  What's the matter?  You don't understand? 
[01:07:00]  Huh?  Jacobs.  You play my promos.  Yeah, we do.  How about this one?  Yeah.  Happy Hanukkah, you kike.  Okay?  What, huh?  That's just...  Yaddle daddle.  Apologize.  How about this one?  Happy Kwanzaa, let's call a spade a spade.  Okay?  Why are you getting so racist, Dice? 
[01:07:30]  Andrew Grease Clay.  Yeah, why are you getting so racist all of a sudden?  All right, hope your holidays bring you some cheer.  I'm gonna bang your ass, you friggin' queer.  Okay?  All right.  And the Dice, I'm killing now.  I'm killing.  I mean, you gotta get your personal.  I'm dying over here.  All right, you want to hang out for the show today?  I'll hang out for a while.  All right.  One more greeting card, Dice.  One more.  All right? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  This one's for lovers, okay?  Okay.  I know that in this world, there's only two of us.  Now, I'm gonna punch you in the friggin' uterus.  See, I kind of bit that one off of Mike Tyson.  But I could do that.  I could do that.  Oh!  So, I'm with this whore the other night, right?  Wait, I thought we were done with you.  I'm with this whore, right?  Okay, you're with this whore, yeah.  And she goes, oh, why do I always have to sleep in the wet spot?  I said, get off of you, Chuck McGee. 
[01:08:30]  Okay?  Okay.  I tasted the new dice on the O&A show.  Happy Chinese New Year, you friggin' slope.  I don't think we need the racist stuff, Dice.  The dice always is racist.  Hey, how about you see my aunt when I go, Chinese, how could you give them keys to a car?  You can blindfold these people with dental flaws, okay?  Hey, didn't we drop a couple of bombs on these people? 
[01:09:00]  Wait, Dice.  Oh!  I thought you were trying to do the Seinfeld thing.  Not the racist thing.  Andrew Dice Seinfeld.  Yeah, I thought you were doing a little Seinfeld.  What's with these airplanes?  What's with the peanuts?  Always with the peanuts.  Huh?  How about these airplanes?  Dice, do you...  With the peanuts.  I'm going to give you the personnel.  Dice, do you have maybe a tender greeting card that you're working on?  Hey, Kramer, suck my hog, okay?  Maybe a tender greeting card?  Tender moments? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Maybe a little softer?  So for like Valentine's Day?  Sure, maybe a Valentine's Day card.  You're so special, and you want to know what?  I love you so, let me see that...  Okay?  Okay?  I love you so, you're a whore.  I'm going to give you the personnel.  Okay.  What does it mean when it feels like an ice pick's going through your temple?  Because I think I'm dying over here. 
[01:10:00]  I don't want me to give you the personnel.  Whore.  This was much funnier than the pay-per-view.  Oh!  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you, Mario?  Yeah, you know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that Dice is one step closer to finding God.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Oh, no, if that ever happens.  Maybe he'll call the new album that or something, you know what I mean?  That's the next step.  Could you see Dice doing that?  So, I got to tell you about my new personal relationship with Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, I got to change the back of my jacket because I'm now a disciple of Jesus.  You hear me?  And you'll hear the words of Christ.  Yeah.  You know, would that just be too much?  That would be something I would check out if he decided to be like a minister or something.  I'd go to church every Sunday to hear that.  Jesus walked around healing people, wearing a loincloth, so the lepers wouldn't have to look at his yambang. 
[01:11:00]  Okay?  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  So, he's walking around.  He sees a leper, you know, and they're like, oh, Jesus, could you cure me?  Yeah, sure.  Slap the nose back on your face.  I'll wave my hand.  You'll be okay.  Hey!  Praise the Lord.  Now, the Lord is our Savior. 
[01:11:30]  I went to a period of my life where I was doing things that maybe the Lord didn't like.  You hear me?  But Jesus is over here now.  Okay?  In my heart.  Jesus is over here now.  It just won't work, man.  And the Lord saith to you, stop your evil ways over here.  Over here.  Okay?  I'm over here now.  My disciple, Club Sutter Kenny, come here. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I found Jesus Christ.  I walk with the Lord now.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, he's over here now.  He's over here.  In Dice's heart.  Dice would like the Virgin Mary, that's for sure, huh?  Hey, I'm a man of God now.  Yeah.  I can't be saying things about the Virgin Mary.  No, of course not.  You know, I would have liked to slip her a nice one in the old days.  Because she is a virgin. 
[01:12:30]  Oh!  It was Immaculate Conception, Jesus, with Mary.  Mary never felt a yam bag on her ass.  Immaculate.  Oh, my God.  Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.  Now I found the words of Jesus.  Right.  Christ is my Savior.  No more with the hairy banana. 
[01:13:00]  Now it's a cross.  I do my work with a cross.  I'm touring the country, spreading the word of God.  Could you see that?  Oh, my God.  That would be too friggin' surreal.  Yeah, Jesus is over here now.  Over here now.  Our Father, who art in heaven.  Oh!  So, you know, in the old days, I might have talked about Moses going to the burning bush 
[01:13:30]  and added in something dirty.  But it's a beautiful thing.  I'm walking with Jesus.  You ever see that picture with the footprints in the sand?  Yeah, there's only one set of footprints.  And Jesus walking next to me during the times of my life.  And I say, hey, Jesus, how come during the toughest parts of my life, there's only one set of footprints?  Why'd you leave me, you scumbag? 
[01:14:00]  And he said, no, Dice, that's when I carried you.  Right.  So I broke down crying in tears.  Let me read now from the book of Dice.  You need a personal relationship with God.  We're all equal.  The chinks, the chinks, the colored, the midgets, the whores.  We're all children of God over here. 
[01:14:30]  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  Hey, shut your ass.  Sorry, sorry.  Okay?  Okay.  You know, I don't want to be laying there dying over here.  Before I find Jesus.  Before you find Jesus.  Right.  Because Satan does seem like a lot of fun.  I don't want to go to eternity with a pitchfork in my ass.  Okay?  Oh!  A dream, you know, bigger than selling out the garden would be Saint Dice. 
[01:15:00]  Okay?  The patron saint of studded leather jackets.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Oh!  I'll be at Saint Whack Bag Episcopal Church.  A cause from Laugh Your Yam Bags Off. 
[01:15:30]  A yam bag.  Oh, my God.  And Stoner Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey.  I learned that in the world according to Dice,  everyone with bad karma is coming back as a midget with sausage-linked fingers.  But even the midgets are children of God.  See, what I was saying before was bad.  You think when midgets go to heaven, they get small little angel wings?  No, it's not funny.  It's really what I'm thinking.  Jesus, over here now. 
[01:16:00]  I was over there.  Now I'm over here with the Lord.  Just remember the battle cry of the Lord.  Jesus is over here now.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the best of the worst of the comedians of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Just hilarious. 
[01:16:30]  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian Howie Mandel.  All right, let me explain what's going on.  Howie Mandel just walked into the studio, but we're in the middle of a subject,  so maybe, Howie, you can jump in, and then we'll get to what you're up to as well, okay?  I'd love to jump in.  All right.  Brian, you're going to explain Life Aquatic?  Well, you know what?  I was going to try to, but you kind of closed on a note,  but just to tie it in with Eddie's movie that just came out,  I think people got to remember sometimes that you're there first to be entertained with a movie. 
[01:17:00]  Life Aquatic, you put it in that, sum it up like this.  They're trying to goof on Jacques Cousteau's life.  Well, I get that.  Right.  Now, other than that, it's kind of like Napoleon Dynamite.  I know people that saw that and said, I don't get what they're doing.  Love it.  It's just a bunch of losers.  And I'd say if you like Napoleon Dynamite, you're going to like Life Aquatic.  Man, maybe I should rent that again and give it another shot.  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  I thought the character development was great.  I thought the characters were very original and stuff, but I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think they're trying to split the atom.  I don't think there's some deep underlying spiritual meaning to Life Aquatic.  I think it's just supposed to be a goof with these characters who are obviously all losers,  or most of them are anyway.  Right.  And that's kind of like Napoleon Dynamite, Big Lebowski, same thing.  You're just watching a bunch of losers go through a mission.  Right.  All right.  All right, man.  Punch it out.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  One more here.  Eric in California.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Eric. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I just want to let you know, with Life Aquatic, it's just supposed to be one of those movies  where you're like, what the fuck?  What the hell's going on?  Where it changes around, everything's all bizarre.  But, oh, seriously, man.  You're always saying that shit sucks.  And it's bumming me out.  Like, you were talking about how Fred and Deep Tracks are just awful stations.  Yeah.  Because they go too far, right?  Yeah.  Well, that's just my taste.  That's all.  I don't want you to...  You don't have to agree with what I say. 
[01:18:30]  I'm just...  So, Life Aquatic, the purpose was to say, what the fuck's going on?  That's what they were going for?  That's what you got out of it?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, this is Howie.  You...  Dude, it's just a weird movie.  It's just a weird movie where...  I know, but you're right.  You don't...  A lot of people don't go...  A lot of...  You know, I've been involved in some films, and I never thought of that.  To go for the audience saying, you know, what the fuck is this?  Well, that's what I was thinking last time.  The fuck am I doing it?  But I watched it over and over again. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  You got to watch it over again so you can keep saying, what the fuck did I watch it the  second time for?  Well, I also think...  Three fucking times I watched this fucking piece of shit.  I don't know what the fuck this is.  A lot of people don't go...  That's a niche.  And you...  He's right.  You're right.  And I love that about it.  Hey, but, man, as for the deep tracks of the Fred, like, isn't that the whole point  of satellite radios to go, like, beyond what commercial radio's doing?  Like, of course it's great that they're playing crazy.  Yes, it is.  Relax.  Don't hold yourself, would you? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, I mean, Eric, you got to understand this show.  We spew our nonsense.  You don't have to agree with it.  We're just giving our opinions and stuff.  I personally don't like deep tracks of Fred because I think they go too deep.  And I think if you bring it in a little bit and play some more familiar stuff, I would  be happier.  He's kind of missed the point.  I think the point of this particular show is for you to listen to it and think, what  the fuck is this?  Yeah, exactly.  That is pretty much it.  I got to tell you, Howie.  Is this for me?  No. 
[01:20:00]  That's just in case somebody cuts in.  That's if Jimmy, which he does, he gets nervous.  Sometimes you cut a gas or it slips out.  And you got to spray because he stinks.  Cans of Lysol.  Yeah.  Cans of Lysol and disinfecting wipes.  I don't know if you know.  Well, that's what we're going to get into.  You got the hand thing.  I hear you have some issues.  Anthony definitely has some issues.  I don't have issues.  I have issues.  I get skeeved out sometimes.  I have some OCD in my family, so I guess I have some issues myself.  I'm thinking with having what they call issues. 
[01:20:30]  What is it if I don't want to shake someone's hand after they come out of the bathroom?  That's not an issue.  That's kind of gross.  I love it.  I love the whole Asian thing.  I wish it would take over the planet.  I want to bow.  You just want to put your hands together.  Hands together and bow.  There's no reason to touch your...  What's with the touching?  I don't like touching.  I hate touching.  I won't touch anyone.  I don't like when people take pictures and they're like, hey, dude, and they get close.  Stay away.  I have no reason to touch anyone.  No touching.  You got to see the shot I took.  How does it mean?  I remember.  We did Tough Crowd together.  And this is the picture he and I have together. 
[01:21:00]  Standing.  Arms behind your back.  That's good.  That's like...  That's one of my favorite shots.  Don't touch.  Yeah, both of us just standing with our arms behind our back stairs.  That's a very awkward photo.  It's a great picture.  Well, we're close.  We're close.  Yet, we're not touching.  Right.  Yes.  And is anyone going to believe that your buddy's enough with Robert De Niro, if you get  a picture with him, that he's going to put his arm around you?  That's how you walk down the street because you're taking a picture and he's got his arm  around you?  You don't need to.  You just need him in the frame.  I always joke and say, you know, it's time for us to make believe we are friends and 
[01:21:30]  then they take the photo.  Yeah, but even friends.  When have you assumed there's no camera around?  I know what you're going to say.  I've known Anthony for 10 years.  Never a hug.  Not even a hug.  You know the pose where you stand beside somebody and you put your arm around them and you face  the camera?  Aside from when there's a camera.  Have you ever just stood like that with Anthony?  If you're a best friend, you would never do that.  Just put your arm around me and let you stand here and just enjoy the moment.  It never happens.  It's a stupid picture.  Everybody's got that picture.  You're absolutely right.  That's ridiculous.  At a urinal, it's acceptable.  That's the only time.  Your friend's there having trouble, maybe prostate problems, you put your arm around them, you 
[01:22:00]  walk them through it.  That's the only time it's allowed to be done.  You've walked your friend through a prostate problem.  Absolutely.  You just stand there with your arm around them, two men talking, getting to know each other,  a little medical help.  No problems.  Howie, can you explain what's going on with you?  You got like the OCD or what?  I have OCD.  You do?  And germs is just one part of it.  You're freaked out by germs?  No.  No, I have OCD.  Do you know what OCD is?  Yeah, my mom has it really bad.  I have it pretty bad.  OCD is obsessive compulsive disorder, so you get a thought in your head, weird thoughts  in your head, and it doesn't go away. 
[01:22:30]  And one of the thoughts, like if I shake hands, I haven't shaken anybody's hand for a couple  of years.  A couple of years?  A couple of times, you know, I'll do it, or the other day somebody grabbed my hand and I'll  do it.  And I actually ended up being okay, but sometimes I don't know if I'll end up okay.  And then for the rest of the day, I have images of, you know, shit on my hands.  And I'll go in, I'll scald my hand, and then I come out back to wherever I was, and then  I can't even hear people talking.  I'm focused on my hand. 
[01:23:00]  Even though you washed?  Even though I washed, and I know logically that I got the hand clean, and then I'm focused  on my hand.  I go back in, and I scald it again, and I come out, and I'll wash my hands up to like  30, 40 times after somebody.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And my hotel room is like nuts with, you know, I'm here in New York, and I'm staying in the  hotel room, and it takes me about two and a half hours to prepare my room so that I'm  comfortable.  I make paths with the towels.  That's what we've heard.  Yeah.  I order a lot of towels, and I'll make paths so I don't have to touch the carpet to all 
[01:23:30]  the different places.  I know that I'm going to go, and I remove the comforter.  What makes the carpet between the towels better than the carpet outside the towels?  Like, I can understand if you just built the house brand new, you could know that that  was clean, but I mean, if you're in a hotel, the carpet between the towels is probably just  as bad as the carpet outside the towel.  I don't, I don't, no, the carpet's not, did they shampoo the room as each person leaves?  No, I don't think.  He doesn't touch the carpet.  I don't touch the carpet.  Oh, no, I thought you were leading out a path.  You actually stand on the towels. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I have.  All right, that makes sense.  Now that makes sense.  That makes perfect sense.  See?  See?  So I've got, I've got towel paths wherever I go.  Okay.  You and I seem to have a simpatico.  But why are the towels okay?  Because they're clean, they're like white, they're bleached, they're bleached, they're  bleached.  I'm okay.  I don't know.  Don't give me another.  All right.  Did you really, someone said that you shaved your head because you're uncomfortable with  the germs?  I actually shaved my head originally for a film, and then, and then.  And then I realized this feels like cleaner.  It feels, it feels clean. 
[01:24:30]  So I keep it shaved now because anything to feel cleaner and not infested with whatever  you could possibly be infested with.  Now, have you been, like, obviously people say, well, the compulsive hand washing is  like, you know, deep seated, like trying to get rid of problems.  I mean, I'm sure you've heard all that stuff a million times.  I'm in therapy.  Oh, you are in therapy.  And I'm supposed to be medicated.  I don't take the medication.  Oh, really?  No?  No.  My mom has tried it all.  It is a nightmare on earth, man.  What's her thing?  It's bad.  She has thoughts that she's killing people, and she's convinced she's killing people, and 
[01:25:00]  she'll see a story in the paper, and she wants to go down to the police station and  turn herself in.  I mean, it's brutal stuff.  But like you said, she knows it's dumb.  Right.  She knows she's not crazy, but she can't get the actual thought out of her head.  You know, it's like you have a CD that skips.  You know, you get this.  I think everybody has these weird, bizarre thoughts going through their heads.  You know, you see a story.  You see something horrible, a horrible thought, a crazy thought, and it just goes by, and  nobody thinks about it.  And what happens is our minds get stuck on that thought, and it keeps repeating and repeating  and repeating.  And over again.  You know, I make fun of it, but it's pretty horrible a lot of the time. 
[01:25:30]  Sure.  How many times have you got to lock the door and stuff before you leave?  You know, I've done it up to maybe 20 times.  I've gone into my car, and I go, oh, I didn't lock the door.  And I go back up to the apartment, and I'll check the door and shake the handle, and it's  locked.  I go back to the car, and then I go, oh, I probably didn't shake it enough.  And I go back to the car, and I shake it again.  But you're down at the car, and you absolutely know it's going to be locked when you go up  there.  You know, I have shaken the door handle, shaken the door handle, then bang, like punched 
[01:26:00]  the door handle so I'll feel the pain in my hand so that when I go down to the  door, I go, I know that I shook it and punched it, so I'll feel the pain.  But maybe I knocked it loose, so I'll go back up, and I'll do it again, and you can't get  that stuff.  Are you just late to everything?  It doesn't always happen.  No, I get that one every once in a while.  Usually when I'm tired, I'll have to keep coming back to my apartment like, all right, it's  locked.  Okay.  And then I'll walk down the end of the block and go, well, exactly how you just explained  it.  You know, so it's not a fun thing, but I deal with it, and I'm able to function. 
[01:26:30]  But I thought you guys put out all this.  For you?  No, it's because he farts through the whole show.  He farts.  I hope you have no problems with farting, because if you do, you might as well leave right now.  Well, I do, but it's not an issue.  It's not a Purell I'm not allowed to use anymore.  Why?  You know what happened?  I did, in 1998, I did, I got a daytime talk show.  Paramount gave me a daytime talk show, and they sat down with me and said, you know, I  said, you know, the only thing that I really have an issue with, and they said, we can't  have you focus on the whole germ thing, and, you know, guests come on, they want to shake 
[01:27:00]  hands, and they want to, you know, so you got to shake their hands.  And I go, okay, because, you know, this is the daytime audience, the ladies are home during  the day, and...  They like a good handshake.  Yeah, and you can't, you know, you can't just talk about how fucked up you are, and  so I said, okay, I'll do it, and you got to wear a suit, and you got to shave, and you  got to take out the earrings, and you got to look like, I guess, Maury Povich.  Right.  They wanted a Maury Povich.  So I went on, but I called my friend who's a surgeon, and I was using Purell like crazy. 
[01:27:30]  My hands are totally soaked in Purell all the time.  My friend's a surgeon.  I said, you know, what's that stuff before you go into the OR?  I see you guys scrubbing that, like, you scrub, and he got me.  I got cases of that stuff.  So before every show, I would scrub up on my hands, and then behind my desk, I had Purell,  and then I would shake everybody's hand, and I had Purell, and then I would scrub after  the show, and I had this thing, and the show lasted for about eight months.  I also don't open doors.  I do, you know, I push it with the side of my hand.  I'll push. 
[01:28:00]  I don't use doorknobs, and I find different ways, and I found, like, wherever I was pushing  the doors, I started getting, I got these warts, and that just blew my, I didn't know  what it was, and I go to the dermatologist, and he goes, you got warts, and I go, how would  I get?  How the hell?  Well, here's what happened.  I killed all the antibodies in my hands, so I was getting, warts are just viruses, so  I would start getting viruses in my hands because I was, my hands were so antiseptic.  You killed all the good stuff that's in there to kill the bad stuff.  Because you spoke, I killed everything, so I'm not allowed to use, I don't use Purell, 
[01:28:30]  I don't use, and if you went, I don't want you to, but if you saw me in a public restroom,  it's like fucking Cirque du Soleil.  I can do, I can do things with my feet, and I could twist things, and I can contort so  that I, I would rather explode than go into a public restroom, but I, when I get there,  I can do things without using hands.  People have goofed on me in the public restroom because I, I, I use the bathroom, and I'll 
[01:29:00]  wash my hands, and I'll use the paper towel, but then I'll use the paper towel to open the  door with, and then hold the door at my foot and throw the paper towel into the, the garbage  so I haven't touched anything after my hands.  There's actually a logical reasoning.  They've done studies.  They do find, like, flex of shit on them.  I mean, that's not lunacy in a public restroom to not want to touch something.  And then the key, who found flex of shit?  They've done studies on, like, doorknobs.  Well, not even doorknobs, you know, they say in the, in the restaurants, in the mints.  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  All right.  Urine.  Yeah.  They found little, little, you know, just microscopic, so that's not complete crazy.  So we're over at the Parker Meridian, and we're having lunch, and I have to use the bathroom. 
[01:29:30]  Now, you need a key.  I won't use it there because the key.  You need the restaurant key.  So we got the key.  Now, she gives me the key, and I go to the bathroom, and everything's fine, and then  I realize, wait a minute, this key is being held by people who don't wash their hands  when they go to the bathroom.  I don't even think that.  See, I was at the Parker Meridian, and I went across the street to the Starbucks, and I pissed  at the Starbucks.  No, see, but you know what I did?  What?  I then took my hands, and the key, and the soap, and washed everything. 
[01:30:00]  You washed the key.  I washed my hands, and the key, and then I rinsed everything off, dried it, so now I'm  carrying back a key that's been washed, and, and gave it back.  I fucking took the key, and I scooped it into my oatmeal, and I ate off it.  Who fucking cares?  I'm the same.  Same way as you go now.  What, do you even catch a cold?  Big deal.  I'm wearing condoms since 1988.  Who gives a shit?  Don't make Howie leave.  No, I'm not.  I love Howie.  We're off to a really good start.  I don't like bathroom stuff.  I understand the mentality, but it just doesn't work that way for me for that.  See, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not as far as you have gone, but I, I like, I don't like 
[01:30:30]  the bathroom stuff.  You're not as far.  You washed the fucking key.  I washed the key.  See, even Howie thinks you're dirty.  I gave the key back, and I never gave it a second thought, Howie.  That is true, you key-washing motherfucker.  You know, we got to get into what Jimmy does on the side, because that would, that has  to just, what, would freak Howie out.  Oh, just the disgusting sexual practices.  I don't even, I don't even know how we go down this road, but.  Go down it. 
[01:31:00]  It would just be a very interesting, what do you do?  He lets attractive women, after he puts plastic down on his bathroom floor, squat over  him and piss on him.  I've been tinkled on him.  He pisses antiseptic, though.  Howie.  Oh, yeah.  What would, what would that do to you, you think?  You know what's funny?  He let some strange chick piss all over you, but you, you put plastic down on the floor,  because God forbid some should get on the tile.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm a neat freak.  He's very pissed on me, but don't mess up my fucking tile. 
[01:31:30]  And then we had a stripper come in, or dance, or whatever the fuck she was.  Oh, she was sexy, man.  She came in, she had spit on the window here and licked it, and I was just completely  skeeved out.  I was skeeved on that one.  It was turning Jimmy on.  Yeah.  She comes in, and they start talking about spit, and Jimmy asks her to spit in his mouth,  and he opened his mouth, she leaned over him, and spit in his mouth, much to everyone's  disgust.  Oh, it was hot, man.  It was hot.  It was not hot.  It was disgusting.  It's a kiss.  It's a different.  It's a kiss.  It is a kiss.  It's a saliva transfer.  It's not a kiss.  It's without that annoying intimacy horse shit. 
[01:32:00]  Who wants eye contact?  How do you deal with intimacy?  You know, I'm intimate with myself.  Yeah, well, that's always good.  Yeah, because I know where I've been.  Right.  But I've been with the same girl for almost 30 years now.  Wow.  Wow.  Who I have hermetically sealed, and she's my wife, but she knows the rituals.  Right, right.  She cleans up, and then I said, are you clean?  I'm coming in.  Does the family ever resent it?  Like, because, you know, it's ritualistic stuff. 
[01:32:30]  It's like, and did they ever just go, fucking enough?  Like, do they ever resent having to do things a certain way?  Because I have children, I've always maintained that, you know, dad's sick, and don't be like  that.  So, you know, I know that for their health reasons and because I'm a responsible parent  that don't, but my wife gets mad at me sometimes.  Because my son, when my son was, I'll tell you, I've had, like, horrible potty training  story.  I had one with my daughter.  My daughter, my first daughter, my daughter's like 21 now, but when she was young, I guess how  old are you when you're potty training?  You're almost two years old. 
[01:33:00]  Depends on the chromosomes.  Right.  But she's, my wife was really into the potty training, you know, and read all the books,  and you have to, you know, after she pees or shits in the potty, you know, we all had  to applaud, and everybody who's around, it's a big deal.  She's just about potty training.  My wife says, I was going out one day, and she says, you take her, you take her with you.  So I have this baby in the car seat, and she's just a little girl, a little baby, and we're  out someplace, and she says to me, Dad, I have to go potty.  And, you know, my heart, I get heart palpitations. 
[01:33:30]  I'm thinking, I can't go in a public restroom.  I can't sit her down.  And where am I going to take her?  I can't go in the men's room, and I don't want her to sit down.  I mean, I can't go in the ladies' room.  I don't want her to sit down in the men's room.  So I said, honey, you know, can you hold it?  Is there any way to hold it?  And she goes, you know, it's a baby.  Yes.  She goes, I'll try, Daddy, because she could see the horror in my eyes.  She goes, I'll try, Dad.  So I put her in the car, and I put her in the car seat, and we're driving down the Ventura  Freeway. 
[01:34:00]  I live in Los Angeles.  We're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  And she goes, from the back seat, I hear, Daddy, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, honey, we'll pull off here, and we'll go to the gas station or something.  She goes, no, I can't hold it.  I go, okay, okay, fine.  So we pull over to the side of the Ventura Freeway, this public freeway, and I pull out,  and there's, like, hedges on the side of the freeway there.  So I get her out.  I unbuckle her from the car seat, and I put her in my arm, and I go over to the hedges,  and I take one step over to the hedges, and I don't realize it's a gully.  It's a ravine.  Oh, my God.  So I step, and I slip on my back. 
[01:34:30]  I fall on my back, and I start hurtling down this mountain, down the side of the Ventura Freeway.  And I'm holding the baby.  I'm coddling her on my side.  She's screaming.  I'm yelling.  The twigs are breaking.  There's mud that my pants rip.  It cuts my ass, and I end up at the bottom of this gully in this horrible, like, infested kind of wet puddle,  and I'm bleeding, and I'm in this gully, and I'm holding the baby, and she's crying,  and I kind of stand up, and I hold her in front of me, and she goes, I got to go. 
[01:35:00]  I got to pee.  I go, okay, all right.  And I look.  My wife had put her in some sort of, like, a jumpsuit kind of thing.  So I unbuckle the thing, and I pull it down around her ankles, and I'm holding her up by the armpits in front of me, and I go, okay, honey, go, go.  And she goes, I can't.  I'm going to pee on my pants.  I'm going to pee because her legs are down below.  And this is the first daughter.  I've never really, you know, I grew up with brothers and everything.  I said, okay, all right, just put your feet up on my shoulders, up on my neck.  I'm holding her in front of me, like, face to face.  Put your feet up on my neck, and then I figure, you know, your legs are out toward me, and then you'll pee down into this. 
[01:35:30]  If a cop saw this, you'd be shot, by the way.  Right.  So her feet are up on my neck, and I go, okay, go.  Well, I didn't know that.  It seems like with the vagina that whatever way your feet are aiming is what way the fluid goes.  So she goes, and then all of a sudden, it's in my face.  She's pissing in my face, my fucking mouth.  In my mouth, I'm screaming like a woman.  Like, and my ass is bleeding. 
[01:36:00]  I'm standing in a puddle of, this is for a guy who didn't want to go into a public bathroom.  And I start to scream, and she's screaming, and it's all over her clothes.  And she goes, I got it on my clothes.  Her fucking clothes, it's in my fucking mouth.  So I'm trying to be a good dad, and I take off the bottom of her pants,  and now she's naked, and my hands are covered in the mud and the blood.  So now it's all over her, and I'm filled with piss.  She's filled with piss, and I try to climb the hill.  Now I'm climbing the hill, and it's mud.  You know, and I get up like five steps, and then I slide back down the hill, 
[01:36:30]  and she's crying, and I'm almost crying, and I can't breathe.  And, you know, my heart, I think I'm going to have a heart attack.  Finally, after it seems like an eternity, I get up on top, on the freeway,  and I come through the hedges like 500 feet from where my car is.  And I'm standing there, and I'm bleeding, and I'm covered in mud, and she's crying,  and there's piss, and there's blood, and a car slows down.  And I got a naked little girl out of the hedges, and the car slows down,  and pulls down his window and goes, are you Howie Mandel? 
[01:37:00]  And I said, no, get the fuck out of here.  No, and we get into the car.  My wife was waiting.  My wife has never let me take the – I don't really take the kids out anymore.  No, I wouldn't let you either.  What a horrific story.  Oh, I hate when that happens.  Fuck.  That is horrid.  Welcome to my life.  Wow.  Do you ever feel guilty over it, like the fact that the family has to kind of do stuff?  Because sometimes you have those moments where you're like, Jesus Christ, man,  my obsession is causing other people's lives to be shifted. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, my son, the first time he went to – he has to go to the men's room alone,  and I think he was like four or five, and he came out.  It was in the middle of a California pizza kitchen, which is this chain out there.  He walks out, and it's packed, and he goes, I went by myself, and I didn't touch anything.  And my wife just turned to me and went, fuck you.  Look at how the fuck you started.  Wow.  But, you know, I work as hard as I do on trying to keep myself germ-free.  I work on telling them that this is not the way to live. 
[01:38:00]  How old were you when it kicked in, or was it your whole life?  You know what?  I didn't realize it was my whole life.  I have a younger brother who, when I was seven years old, would just – we didn't –  a lot of brothers fought physically.  He would just hold the lid to the laundry hamper, and it would scare me.  And everybody thought it was kind of funny and weird.  You know, and I would never – I would always wrap up my own laundry,  and I had my own little rituals and counting things and doing things,  but nobody knew what it was then.  You know, I've been around for a long time.  So why not the medication before we move on from this?  Because, look, after all these stories, life is great. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  No.  Actually, my life is great.  You know, I have a functioning relationship with three kids.  Yeah.  You know, I'm working, and I like – I don't want it to take the edge off of whatever –  you know, until I feel that I can't function or the people around me are really being inhibited by what I do,  then I will.  Do you notice it getting better or worse or staying the same?  Oh, it goes in ebbs and flows.  There's sometimes when I'm – and probably you'll notice that with your mother.  You know, there are times when it's just not bad and you wouldn't know.  And I don't know if stress brings it on. 
[01:39:00]  I don't know what brings it on.  You know, they're starting to connect it to – there's a study in California that connects it to strep.  You know, I had a lot of ear infections when I was a little baby,  and they're saying that that strep, that whatever that virus is – because it's physiological.  It's not a – it's not a – it's supposed to be a physiological problem.  I think it's like some sort of chemical problem.  Chemical imbalance.  Wow.  The ability to not let a thought go.  Whatever it is.  Whatever it gets in there.  Some days my mom is completely normal, and it's like – and then she goes back to, you know, just freaking out. 
[01:39:30]  The scariest thing about it is when you have those freak outs, and you know – you know, you know,  it would be better if you didn't know that what you're thinking is psycho, you know,  but you're so aware and cognizant that what you're thinking is psycho.  Yeah.  Which makes you even more psycho.  You go, I know this is ridiculous.  Yeah.  But –  Isn't it amazing that, you know, somebody who's a comic – now it's your job to get up on stage  and make people laugh, and, you know, nobody's the wiser, and it's got to be difficult in some situations 
[01:40:00]  to get up there and be funny when you're just either horrified or freaking out or whatever.  And – yeah, it is.  But – and also, you know, I'm doing a new show.  I'm doing a new show on – and this is not a segue to promote the show.  Oh, it's okay.  We can move on.  Anyway.  No, I'm not moving on.  No?  What I'm saying – no.  What I'm saying is I got the show on Bravo.  I do, like, these hidden camera pieces, and that's what I'm doing, and premieres August 18th.  Very good.  At 11 o'clock on Bravo. 
[01:40:30]  But a big part of it, it's a half reality and half – a big part of it is I decided to do my real life.  So a big part of it is showing the OCD and my germ phobias and all that.  And what I have found in the fact that I talk about it publicly, you know, when I go out,  people have listened to this show.  They'll walk out and they'll go, hey, Howie, how you doing?  I heard you on the radio today.  I'm not going to shake your hand.  It just makes my life easier and makes my world easier if I do it on television,  if I talk about it on the radio.  It's kind of – I used to not talk about it. 
[01:41:00]  They still understand, and they won't think you're just a dick, you know, because you're not shaking their hand.  Right.  Most people are angry.  You know, I started – I used to go out.  I used to go out and bandage.  We do fists.  That's what I do.  We do a quick little fist.  Yeah, that's how I came into that.  That's how I came in.  I'll do the fist.  Right.  But I used to, before I came to that, I used to – I would put a Band-Aid.  I would put a Band-Aid on my hand, and they'd go – they'd extend their hand to shake it,  and then I'd go, look, I got a Band-Aid.  So then they would go – they would go – then they'd extend the other hand.  All of a sudden, everybody's into, like, a left-handed –  I don't do left-handed shakes.  Right.  But I couldn't – so then what I did is I put a Band-Aid on the right hand, 
[01:41:30]  and I put a Band-Aid on the left hand.  It was a bizarre clapping accident.  Then they'd go, what happened?  Then you had to come up with – then I had a sling.  Then I had two slings.  Then I had – it was just bizarre.  You're giving Anthony ideas here.  Oh, I love this.  You know, but now I just go OCD.  But it's still the thing with the fist.  I do the fist.  Yeah.  You know, and some people, they don't know what to do.  Like, I'll extend the fist.  Just do this, and then people will just grab your fist.  Oh, don't do that.  Is that why you have rings on the end, too, just to kind of keep the thing –  you would probably want to use four rings just to stop the things from touching? 
[01:42:00]  You're right.  I didn't think of that.  Now the rings are big rings over there.  Yeah, I got rings.  It kind of keeps –  It keeps it away from my flesh.  But people don't know what to do with the fist.  And then you'll do it to, like, you know, a black guy will come up to you,  and I'll give the fist.  And then they think – I've got to tell them it's not like a BET thing.  It's an OCD thing.  Because then they want to grab hands at the end.  They think I'm just trying to be – no, when you extend the fist,  sometimes they think you're trying to be, like, hip, you know, and you've got the whole –  Then you've got a whole thing you've got to do.  Yeah, they touch the end of the fist, and they bop you on the top of the fist. 
[01:42:30]  All of a sudden you're doing ink-a-bink-a-bottle-a-ink, the cork fell out, and –  Fing-fong-fooey.  How do you remember that?  No.  What?  The inky-binky thing.  Inka-bink-a-bottle-a-ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.  Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean,  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine stand.  And you are not at eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch-a-fella.  Well, we know how that one goes.  Catch-a-fella.  Hey, Nellomia, Jessica Simpson comes up to you right now and says,  I have to blow you. 
[01:43:00]  I know you're married, you wouldn't do it, but let's just –  I'm talking OCD-wise.  No, no, no, no, no, right.  OCD-wise.  I have to blow you.  Where does shaking hands come into that?  No, no, but I'm –  No, but that's – I have no problem with that.  All right, let's seal the deal with a shake.  Don't shake his hand.  Well, then I can't – then I can't have the blowjob.  Look, anyone can suck my cock, that's fine, but get off my hands.  It's true.  That's where my issue is.  It's just my hands.  What about him and pussy going down?  What about –  It's fine with you if it's the same girl over 30 years, though. 
[01:43:30]  It's like if you –  We're not – yeah, I don't want to bring his wife into that.  No, no, but I'm saying would it bother you if it was somebody who didn't know to give –  If you were single right now and a girl wanted you to go down on her.  Right.  What would go through your mind?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a good thought, though.  I don't know.  My issue is my hands.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I have that – it doesn't make any sense to me, but my issue is my hands.  Would you go down on her if you met her when she walked out of a Port Authority bathroom  and she had paper trailing from the back of the pants? 
[01:44:00]  That wouldn't be – if she had walked out of your place, I would be more,  because I know she had just pissed all over you.  I've seen Howie on Regis many times, and I don't see Regis asking these questions.  No, this is a lot different.  This is a lot different.  Why are you washing your hands so much?  Angry Regis.  I like this.  I like this.  This is a lot – no, I have no issues with – I have no issues with any other –  I have other issues besides shaking hands, but not with germs.  You're afraid as a comedian of the medication kind of affecting the brain, right? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, he makes a great point with losing the edge.  That's very interesting.  Because you see people who are like – whether it's Paxil or whatever they're on,  you know these guys in the business, they always get that white shit in the corner of their mouth,  and they're just so neutral about everything.  So neutral.  They really are, man.  They have no anger and no happiness.  They're just kind of talking like that.  You've got to wonder, how is that better?  Level down.  Absolutely.  But when you hear all the side effects of every kind of medication, you wonder why it's better for these people.  I guess for some people it is better because if you can't deal with it in your own mind, what's the alternative? 
[01:45:00]  I'm neurotic.  Are they talking about me?  Are they talking – some guy came in and told another guy a secret.  Really?  It was funny.  I watched how he looked, too.  He looked to the right.  No, they just do that because we're on air.  Because they are assholes.  What was the secret you told them?  What was the secret?  What did you say?  Well, we're just setting up something.  We're going to bring in someone that's very sick, and they're going to just start coughing all over the place.  And we want to see –  No, no.  It's all right.  Are you a crazy person? 
[01:45:30]  Opie.  They do it all the time.  He'll come in.  He stays on that computer, and he'll come and talk to them.  No, it's totally cool.  We're just messing with you.  It's nothing.  All of a sudden, a guy comes in.  Stop bothering Mr. Mandel, you fucking creep.  Right.  I saw The Aristocrats.  Yes.  You're in there, and you shocked me with the C word.  Well, there are two words.  That's what I love about this movie, and I can't believe I'm just saying the C word because we're on satellite.  No, but there are two words.  The two words that the female, that any woman hates most are, number one, the C word, and number two, cunt. 
[01:46:00]  Right?  Yeah, those are them.  Yes, I think those are them.  I think that's the end of the list.  That's what I love about The Aristocrats.  I think it's a great movie, and getting rave reviews, so they don't need my help, but all you guys going and just showing a little bit of yourselves.  I think on the DVD, they're going to show the whole, you know, I think they sat with each one of us for over an hour, and we told it, and they decided, I guess my little portion was the, I said cunt a lot.  Yeah.  I heard there were certain comedians that wouldn't curse, and I guess, look, you've got to be true to what you do, but then there's a certain thing, it's like, there's got to be a certain camaraderie as comics where it's like, yes, we're telling a dirty joke. 
[01:46:30]  I don't care if you're Cosby or, you know, Rita Rudner.  It's like everyone has reveled in a dirty joke, and that's like what this is, I think part of it's about, and there's certain comics that wouldn't do that.  There were people that wouldn't do it in The Aristocrats?  Yeah, I heard that John Stewart wasn't that dirty, or I heard, what's her name?  Rita Rudner.  Rita Rudner wasn't dirty.  I heard a couple of them weren't.  I think they were as dirty as they are, you know, I think that John Stewart was actually pretty funny in it. 
[01:47:00]  Well, someone said he wouldn't do it, he wasn't that dirty, he was kind of like careful.  He's in it.  I haven't seen it.  Well, I, no, no, honestly, and I'm a fan of John Stewart, it seemed like he was very safe with his presentation.  But you don't know, you know, the point is, you don't know how long, that's what was edited in, so you don't know, you don't know where it got to, and I thought what he did was really funny.  Well, he used to do our show, and he was a lot different than what he's doing now, is all I'm saying, so it seems like.  John's got a certain image he's got to uphold these days.  That's what we're sort of thinking.  It's almost like that Daily Show has become a real news show. 
[01:47:30]  It was a complete parody of the news, and now they're saying a lot of people are getting their news from it.  It's actually throwing a lot more facts out there than jokes about news.  Right.  They keep it funny and entertaining, but, you know, I think he's also got, he's kind of getting into that image of almost an anchorman.  Al Franken wants to run.  No, but, you know, but also you have to also look at, if you're talking about the aristocrats, you have to look at, you know, they came to us, you know, either Paul Provenza or Penn Jillette would call and say, you know the joke.  And you guys know the joke. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  The aristocrats joke.  So it's just about being filthy, and we're going to talk about the joke.  You can do the joke.  You can do any twist you want on the joke, and we'd love you to be part of this.  And they would come to wherever it was most convenient to you.  If you look, most of the people were in their private offices.  They were in their houses.  They were in their houses.  You know, and it was a joke that really is never really that often told on stage.  It's told amongst your cohorts.  With John, he was in his workplace.  He was there in the makeup room, and he had the makeup people, you know.  So you have to. 
[01:48:30]  And it sort of horrified one of his workers as he was telling.  Yeah.  As he was doing what he was doing.  I thought she was funny.  I thought it was funny.  I thought he was a good part of the movie.  I haven't seen the thing.  I just heard of him.  Go see it.  You won't think.  He's not holding back anymore.  And you don't know maybe when you see the DVD of it.  I loved, like, Jason Alexander got really dirty, which was a surprise.  Drew Carey.  Who else?  Saget.  Well, Saget.  We had him on the show last week.  He was great.  He was really funny.  Oh, he's filthy.  He's really fast, too, man.  Because I had never seen him.  I mean, I'm doing stand-up since 1990. 
[01:49:00]  So I think he was kind of, like, in full house, like, pretty much right around the time I got in.  So I never saw him do stand-up before.  Right.  But he is really fucking quick, man.  Not only is he quick, you know, I knew him from him and I started at the same time.  He was, he's just, most of what he does is off the cuff.  And it was always filthy.  He was always the filthy, edgy comic.  They would put him on at night, and he was filthy.  So to see him, for us, who started out with him, to see him on full house, that was the joke.  And that was weird.  And he was doing, he was also a correspondent for the CBS Morning News before that. 
[01:49:30]  He did that.  He did that.  And I think, how could they put Saget on the Morning News?  How could they put Saget with these little girls?  How could they put, and now you go see the aristocrats, and you watch this guy who's talking about fucking kids in an eye socket.  And you go, oh my God, that's the guy from full house.  No, that's the guy, that was Saget.  That's really him.  And that's the guy that they put on full house.  That's the joke.  Because everyone's now looking at him like he went insane, but no, this is his real personality.  It's how we'd feel if Voss got a job on a TV as a scientist.  Right, exactly.  There you go.  Did you guys do the, you and Saget on the Young Comedian special? 
[01:50:00]  Was that the same one?  No.  My Young Comedian special, I think I did the sixth.  On mine was Seinfeld.  Right, that was the one.  And Harry Anderson, and Richard Lewis.  It's so cool to watch those classic, on classic HBO comedy where they show the old specials,  the old comedy specials, and you're like, holy shit, look at this.  And then you'll see one guy, it's like, wow, he went nowhere.  Like they'll have one guy you never heard from again, ever.  But I think we had a good, I mean, Seinfeld, Richard Lewis, Harry Anderson, and Sean Maury, 
[01:50:30]  and Maureen Murphy, who I don't know where she is now.  Maureen Murphy used to be.  I've heard her name around, though.  Sean Maury I've never heard of.  And the Smothers Brothers were the host.  Right.  They were funny in the movie, too.  Yeah, they were.  I think they were really funny.  The mime was hilarious.  The mime was great.  I thought Sarah Silverman just kicked ass.  I love the movie.  I'm going to go see it again, actually.  Nice to see it getting a huge fucking press, too, man.  Everybody's talking. 
[01:51:00]  People are picking up on it.  Bob Saget was just on CNN.  I know.  Talking about the aristocrats.  And you were on what?  You did Regis.  You were on TV this morning.  We looked up, and you were like.  I saw you on Regis this morning as we're doing our show.  I'm like, he's not going to come in here.  I wasn't really on Regis.  I just went.  I sat in the audience because I'm such a huge fan of that show.  No, I was hosting.  I was hosting for the last two days, and then today I actually sat in there.  His audience loves you, though, with the hidden.  That's why I sat with them.  The hidden camera stuff.  The hidden camera.  That's where that all started, right?  You started doing it for him. 
[01:51:30]  Gilman gave me the glasses.  I got these glasses.  Part of my OCD is I get obsessed about things, so I carry the glasses wherever I go, and  every day I go out and I fuck with people.  A lot of them end up on The Tonight Show.  A lot of them end up on Regis, and some of them just end up in my own personal collection.  But I realized I have restraining orders to stay away from places, and I've gotten in  trouble, and I've been beaten up.  You've been beaten up for what?  This is a show for annoying somebody.  They don't know it's me, and sometimes they find out it's me, and they hit me harder. 
[01:52:00]  And you're just trying to wash off with it.  Hey, I'm Howie Mandel.  I'm doing a fuck you.  I've never loved it.  You fucking idiot with a fucking glove.  He's not punching back.  He's applying Purell to his cheapo.  But I realized that it was a, you know, that maybe there's a show in this and how it affects  my family.  Everybody's real in the show, except my wife wouldn't be on camera, so Julie Warner plays  my wife.  You know?  Interesting.  And you see the effects of these hidden cameras, how I get ideas for them, and then what happens 
[01:52:30]  during them, and how they affect my life after.  Sounds like a good show.  It's on Bravo, you said?  11 o'clock Thursday night, this coming Thursday, on the 18th, 11 o'clock Thursday night, watch  it, this premiere, a little sneak peek.  You bring your own mic, man, because one of the things that disgusts me is when you're  doing a bit, and you'll breathe a certain way, and you smell the mic, and that is just,  that's revolting to anybody.  Do you travel with your own?  No.  He does now.  Now I will.  I wasn't thinking.  Why are we giving him that?  Dude, I don't have it to that extreme at all, and that bothers me. 
[01:53:00]  At all?  You're letting strange chicks piss all over you.  I'm just a good egg.  At least you're not like, who is that?  We used to hear the stories, was it Danny Thomas?  There were stories.  Oh, yeah, laying under a coffee table?  Yeah.  Laying under a coffee table, like what a rookie.  That's an amateur.  Yeah.  Yeah, why do you ruin the furniture that way?  But that wasn't piss.  No, I know.  No, there have been stories.  Was it Danny Thomas?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Jimmy's been known to take a log every once in a while.  I don't take a log, but if one slips out, what am I going to do, criticize?  You know, you take it, you laugh it off later.  You know he's never coming back, right? 
[01:53:30]  You've had a chick shit on you.  No, no, no.  Maybe theoretically.  You know, maybe it happened once.  Who knows?  I don't remember.  Look him in the eye.  You don't remember.  How can that happen?  I think something happened.  It's the shame.  He's just covering the shame.  No, not at all.  You let somebody shit on you, right?  No, not at all.  No, it never happened.  You guys are polar opposites as far as personal lives.  Oh, please.  No, it's probably not as opposite as you think.  It just manifests itself differently.  If you touched yourself, each other, the universe would explode.  But you let it shit on you?  He's not even facing you anymore, Jimmy. 
[01:54:00]  No, it's possible.  Maybe it happened once, but it was just like a whole thing happening.  And maybe it was supposed to be on my chest.  But I yawned.  I mean, you never know.  And it rolled off?  It possibly could have happened.  Don't make Howie investigate you with his glasses.  Maybe.  You forget.  I don't remember.  It could have happened.  And was it disgust?  Or was it an accident?  I mean, was it...  Disgust.  Try for $400.  We're just keeping it real here, Howie.  Trip to Fetish Town doesn't come cheap. 
[01:54:30]  Isn't that awful?  How horrible.  Did you put the plastic down?  You have to.  You have to.  You would be irresponsible otherwise.  Howie's not even facing you anymore.  He's got his back dirty.  He puts the plastic down.  He's a class guy.  That's so funny, because if we touched the universe, we'd explode.  Complete opposites.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm laughing on the outside, but inside, I'm screaming.  Absolutely.  I'm freaking out.  I can imagine.  I'm crying. 
[01:55:00]  But we're not that different, believe it or not.  It just completely comes out in a completely different area.  It's the same thing in the head.  Everyone can relate on certain levels.  I think everybody has it to some extent, but it's what level it is and how you deal with it.  That's it.  Right.  And did you have her shit on you because you thought that would be fun, or was she supposed  to shit on you so you're supposed to look at it and think, oh, what the fuck's this all  about?  Like Life Aquatic?  I'm so glad he put a good joke at the end of that, because I was going to have to answer 
[01:55:30]  like a real question and examine myself.  You'll answer it.  I don't know why.  Is it the hotness of looking at her parts, just the physical aspect of watching it open  up?  There's nothing hot about that.  Okay.  It's awful.  Then it's something about you've been a bad boy and need to be shown something.  Oh, no.  If I would ever do something like that, it would never be a shame issue.  You know, like with regular sex and men and regular sex, once you come, that's it.  The feeling goes away and you want to get her out of there and you want to leave and  it's over. 
[01:56:00]  Once she shits, once you're just sitting there and she's gone and you're lying there with  just a big, just a pile of shit all over your face, a patty on you, do you feel good  about yourself?  Do you feel, is it a nice, what is that feeling?  I would imagine you'd feel no different about yourself, because it's not an esteem thing.  Even tinkle, it's not like I'm not naughty, I'm not naughty, I'm a fucking filth bag.  I don't feel repressed or dirty if a girl pisses on me at all.  You know what I mean?  I feel like, go ahead, piss on me.  What pleasure center is being taken care of in that, though? 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  What pleasure do you get from whispering sweet nothings?  But fuck it, people do it.  Maybe a bad example.  It is a bad example.  Yeah, whispering sweet nothings.  That's a big leap from sweet nothings to a pile of shit on your face.  There's a lot of real estate in between.  That's a shitty something.  Oh, God.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the best.  Boo! 
[01:57:00]  The best of the worst of the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian, Louis Black.  Cocky.  And I say, what?  It ain't bragging if you do it and you back it up.  They say I'm cocky.  And I say, what?  It ain't bragging if you do it and you back it up.  And we back it up.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:57:30]  Louis Black in the studio.  The radio edit there, huh?  Yeah, I know.  A little radio edit.  Mother effer.  I like that version.  Louis Black playing Town Hall June 14th.  Chandra Levy is dead.  Well, I think that was apparent.  She's dead.  She's dead.  They found her remains.  She's in Rock Creek Park.  I know Rock Creek Park.  You do? 
[01:58:00]  I'm from that area.  You are, are you?  Yeah, I used to play.  It's where you'd go run around.  I like the fact that they had police dogs searching that whole area.  For how long?  Yeah.  For months and months and months and months.  And nothing.  Yeah.  Some guy's walking his dog and the dog kind of pulls him over to that, sniffs around and  starts digging and finds her.  Yeah.  Plus, they knew.  That's what's nuts, too.  They knew this.  I didn't.  I mean, until they, you know, they knew that she was going over there.  Yeah.  So wouldn't that be the primary cherry? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, but she was buried, my friends.  Yeah, she was.  And the dog dug up a little.  I think a little coyote or a bear or a dog, something dug that up.  She was in the shallow grave.  She was in a shallow grave somewhere.  Bear in D.C.  A bear?  A bear being in the District of Columbia.  There's got to be one.  One bear.  One left.  Wandering around.  Wandering around.  Wandering around.  Looking for some food.  Come on.  They have all kinds of.  I'm a little lost.  Very hard to find clues.  Looking for his pal, Boo Boo.  Very hard to find clues at this point because she was so decomposed, she was nothing more 
[01:59:00]  than a skeleton.  And jewelry.  They did find a Walkman on her ears, and it's assumed that she was listening to Don and Mike  and died of boredom there in D.C.  Thank God her tape thing was on record, and all they heard was this.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Hi, Boo Boo. 
[01:59:30]  The official cause of death, bored dead.  I was, uh, now I'm re-fascinated with the story.  Remember when she disappeared, everyone was fascinated with it, then we had that other big  story, and now it seems people are so willing to just forget about that one, and we're getting  back to things like David Blaine on a pole and Chandra Levy.  And she, uh, came back like, you know, the bitch wasn't satisfied with a little fame 
[02:00:00]  that she had for those few minutes.  Yeah.  You know, like, like, like Darva, she has to come back now because she was out of the  news for a while.  And the cops can't find her, and who finds her?  Some schlub who's out looking for a turtle.  Oh, is he turtle hunting?  He was looking for turtles in the park.  What a zilch.  Imagine thinking it's a shell and you just pick up the top of her skull.  Oh, it's a little head.  What is that there?  I thought it was a big albino turtle.  I always get a little too deep into these things. 
[02:00:30]  I start thinking, and it's a kind of, sort of macabre, the way I think about this, but  knowing that she was dead, and she was laying there in those woods for so long, all I kept  thinking was, when, at what point, at what point during the time that our parents were  pleading for her to at least call and say she was okay, or pleading with some captor,  or some, some hint that would let them know where her little girl was, at what point during 
[02:01:00]  that time did that jawbone just go, and fall open as, as the remaining connective tissue  was gnawed away by a bug.  You know, when they find their skeletons and that jaw is just eerily hanging open, like  an Indiana Jones movie.  When was it, okay, shot, and then just, there had to be a moment, a day, a minute, where  it just went, and opened up. 
[02:01:30]  Was it when they were saying, please, Chandra, call us, call us, and it's opening up.  Wow.  I never, I never want to hear about, I think about that.  I don't ever want to hear about your family life.  When did what, when did what was earlier during her livelihood, her pubie mound, when did that  make contact with her tailbone?  Just from, they had to make contact at some point during the rot phase. 
[02:02:00]  I needed an asthma inhaler.  When did that mouth that got her the internship to begin with just pop open?  You think about horrific things like that.  Don't tell me you never thought about a friend that had passed on and how they must look at  each day rotting in their coffin.  Oh my God.  You never think about that?  No.  I think about that creepy stuff, because no matter how deep you bury them, they're there.  It's creepy.  They're somewhere in space and time. 
[02:02:30]  And she was laying out there in the open.  One day, maybe a little coyote came along and gave a nibble on a toe.  Or a raccoon or something.  There's coyotes in Washington.  You guys got to go to D.C.  There's got, we've been there.  There's no coyotes in Washington.  We were just there two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  There are no coyotes.  Hundreds of rabid fans outside.  Well, no, now it's being reported that JFK had to pay those people to be there.  Oh, is that it?  No, it's not.  It's better than...  I swear to God.  It's not.  I swear to you.  I don't know.  It's now being reported that JFK hired people to be in the... 
[02:03:00]  Who said that?  In the parking lot.  Oh, come on.  Who said that?  Some fans of another show.  No, they didn't.  I swear to you.  That's ridiculous.  They were paid.  Yeah, right.  Okay, you're right.  They were paid.  You got it.  I went to.  And the girl that drank out of my mule was paid, and actually she was.  Hey, guys, want to go turtle hunting?  Oh, little turtle.  Oh, look.  Hold on.  Ann has disturbed Dawn.  What's the problem, Dawn?  Dawn, what's up?  You are out of your mind. 
[02:03:30]  I can't believe you think of those sick things like that.  I think of these horrific images like that.  Oh, my God.  My stomach is so upset.  I want to vomit on myself.  Like, whenever somebody you know, whenever they die, like, you know, when my, let's say  my grandfather, when he died, all I thought about for, like, months and months on end was,  all right, what phase of the rot is he in now?  Are the gaunt cheeks stretching the skin over the bone?  What horrible movie did you watch that starred you for you to think of these sick images? 
[02:04:00]  Things like Creepshow.  It horrified me.  How many times did you whack your back thinking of that?  Just cranking.  Oh, my God.  Just cranking.  Yeah, you rot, Grandpa.  Oh, you just rot away.  As I just did.  Notice how I was really doing the jerk motion.  Are you bouncing?  I'm bouncing.  I'm thinking of rotting Grandpa, and I'm cranking.  Okay, I got to hang up.  You're making me more sick.  No.  You never thought of what happens like that?  No.  Stop it. 
[02:04:30]  You're lying.  No, I was not that right.  There are images that you get in your head of what happens at that point.  No.  When they find a body.  You don't think, you don't think, what's his face in there?  No, no, no.  Who is that?  John Walsh from Americans Most Wanted.  Adam Walsh is funny.  You don't think he thought at some point where his little boy's head was?  Holy ass.  What's wrong with you today?  You think of things like this when death and bodies are involved.  Yeah, sometimes you do. 
[02:05:00]  Like, you wonder exactly at what point did the fat guys realize, wow, we are never even getting a one.  When did that happen?  You do wonder when something is dying slowly and horribly.  Right, and just rotting away.  Yeah, who carried off the first eyeball?  Who walked off with it?  Was it a raccoon?  Was it a big colony of ants going, oh, it's a big round cricket?  Because they don't know better.  They're stupid ants, Lewis.  And they're like, thud, thud, trying to bang it into the hole. 
[02:05:30]  But it ain't big.  The hole ain't big enough.  I just got to go.  Now, when, at what point in the childhood did this, I'm serious, did you start to fix it?  I think.  Nobody.  I have never, ever.  I have seriously ever heard anybody.  No one has even.  You have crossed the territory.  You've moved into a place.  I'll be honest with you.  I think I know when it was.  I had a cat, a little brown cat named Smokey, Lewis.  He was named Smokey.  Don't tell the Smokey story. 
[02:06:00]  Lewis, you don't want to hear that.  It was the cutest little brown, long-haired cat named Smokey.  Meow, meow, meow.  Little Smokey.  And one day, Smokey wasn't home.  I came home from school.  I'm like, Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey.  And no Smokey.  So I asked Mom, where's Smokey?  Dad, no one knows where Smokey is.  Days go by, and I'm really freaking out.  And my father told me that Smokey had ran off. 
[02:06:30]  And Smokey's in a better place, I guess.  He had seen, like, where Smokey was, but for some reason couldn't get it.  The story's a little shaky in my head.  Yes.  Yeah.  It turned out, as I was walking home from school one day, taking the usual way, but I crossed the street by the woods.  Yeah.  And in the gutter, just off the road. 
[02:07:00]  No!  I saw something, Lewis.  I saw something brown.  And as I went toward it, I saw it was an animal.  And the closer I got, and as that smell of rotting animal would tell you, something has died.  And it is truly rotting.  And as I walked up, I saw, oh my God, it's Smokey.  And I took a stick, and I went to flip Smokey over to see the other side of Smokey. 
[02:07:30]  I didn't know I'm a kid.  And Smokey was flat on that one side with his flesh eating away to the rib cage and maggots crawling all over my little Smokey.  And all I could think of for nights and nights and nights on end was how long Smokey laid there as a recognizable Smokey.  And when that side became flat and how long it took for the maggots to eat the flesh away to expose the ribs. 
[02:08:00]  And then ever since that point, I've always thought that whenever death is involved, that, you know, what's the decaying process?  And what point are they at right now?  Is that scaring you, Lewis?  I can't breathe.  Did you kneel down and cry and shake them like Ricky Schroeder and say, wake up, champ?  Wake up, champ?  Did Jack Warden cry while you petted Smokey for the last time, did he? 
[02:08:30]  No, it wasn't like that.  I was kind of scared to touch.  That's why I used a stick.  And he tussled his little head for the last time.  Karen, what's up?  Well, I was going to call and say hi to Lewis Black, but now all I can think of is my older brother who passed away 10 years ago.  Oh, no.  Did you ever think about it, Karen?  Look what you did today.  Yeah, I did.  In fact, I asked the funeral director what was going to happen to him.  No, no, no.  See, you sick bitch.  No, no, no.  I'm not.  I was worried about what happens after, you know? 
[02:09:00]  No, no.  Yeah.  I always picture things, too, because, you know, there were years ago.  This is like, we should be doing an ad for cremations.  There was a very lovely young girl that died well before she should have.  And whenever I think about a situation like that, you just picture, like, how if a child, a young child has died, they dress him in the cute little dresses and whatnot. 
[02:09:30]  And then you just picture this skeleton with the dry skin and the clumps of hair falling out.  But the dress is still all pretty.  What is wrong with you today?  You lost even me today.  That's not possible.  Trust me.  He lost me.  He lost me.  It's sick.  I know.  You lost me with that.  It's just something.  Hey, I also think of quantum physics.  I think of a lot of everything. 
[02:10:00]  Lois, stop laughing.  You know, I'm stronger than that thong is hugging her tailbone.  Oh, God.  That one sexy thong is just crumpled with bones in it.  Let's see, yeah.  You got to think there's a skeleton wearing a thong.  There's a bra with nothing in it.  The bra.  Karen.  Just on those blades, shoulder blades.  You guys are making me feel better.  Karen, help me here.  Help me.  Sure.  What do you got?  Anything else?  Well.  The front release clip laying on the sternum.  All right.  Stop.  Just let me say hello to Lois and ask him to talk. 
[02:10:30]  What are the odds that it's going to lay right perfectly centered?  It ain't.  It's going to be off to the side.  Sometime during the assault or burial, you know, it was shifted a little, so now it will  be like that forever and ever.  Until they find him turtle hunting.  Forever and ever.  Little tag from the thong, just tickling the cockies.  The cockies.  Little bony white feet sticking out from those jogging sneakers.  Just jogging to stay healthy.  How ironic. 
[02:11:00]  See, no one understands me.  Oh, look at James.  I am with Lois on this one.  Oh, man.  All right.  It's a little dark, but I'm sitting right between them.  We all have our dark moments.  Now I'm going to have dreams.  Stephanie.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I think we need to hear a little Kill a Kitten for your tribute to Smokey.  Smokey.  Yes.  All right.  We'll do that.  Awesome.  Thanks.  Thank you.  See you.  No one understands me.  Let me, uh, let's go to Lois.  Hey, Lois, what's up? 
[02:11:30]  Lois.  The Lois.  Lois?  Something's wrong with the phones today.  Oh, well.  One more try here.  Lois.  Well, people are careening off the road in the middle of some of these discussions.  Uh, you know, I cannot believe.  Lois?  The fact that you can get this up your chest is what's, there's almost a sign of health  to it.  But the fact that you, no, I'm serious.  But the fact that you share it is wrong.  Being able to speak about it is great, but you're supposed to do this in some sort of  professional atmosphere.  I know, but I, you know, I never really thought about it. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, dude, I'm sorry.  I stepped away from the phone for a second.  Oh, you don't have time for that.  Hey, Ant, I think you're old enough to hear this now.  I mean, you've matured.  You've become successful.  The last word Smokey heard before he killed himself was,  Shut up.  Talking about Smokey like that.  Rock Hole.  Why is Rock Hole calling today?  Hey, Rock Hole.  Hey.  What's going on? 
[02:12:30]  Your name is Greg?  Oh, that's awesome.  That is so funny.  You got him there, Rock Hole.  You got him good that time.  You got me.  Welcome to the club.  And if I've learned anything, it's that calling into this show doesn't help boost your rating.  It stinks.  I just get destroyed by some lesion-headed comic. 
[02:13:00]  Come on, Rock Hole.  And you too.  Come on.  Be nice, Rock Hole.  I am being nice.  What are you doing on your show today?  My show today?  Well, basically, I'm just listening to you guys.  And we just got done talking about David Blaine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I actually heard a bit that we got to talk about this maybe a little later.  Heard a bit, and then I searched the web because the bit sounded familiar,  and I found a recording of the exact same bit that Rock Hole did.  Which one? 
[02:13:30]  Done better.  I'm not going to say it because I want to play it at some point.  But it had been done years ago, word for word, and the acting in his version is so bad.  Really funny.  Good job, Rock Hole.  Thanks.  All right, man.  All right, dude.  Later, Greg.  Rock Hole's getting a kick out of your M.A.  Dean, what's up?  All right, Frank.  Hey, Dean.  I tell you, I thought that yesterday was the worst I could possibly hear in cringe radio 
[02:14:00]  with Steve the Whistler.  And, you know, it was bad because he was in studio.  I thought when you guys tooled on Mr. DVD, that was pretty bad.  But today takes the cake, man, by far.  All right, Dean.  Very good.  Dean from D.C.  Look, we have a listener in D.C.  Yeah.  Thank you, Dean.  Take care, boys.  All right.  Peace.  I had to pay people to stand outside.  Hey, you ever think of celebrities like that, too?  Because sometimes that happens.  No, I don't like thinking that way.  Well, nobody does.  It's hard enough getting across the street than thinking, oh, I'm looking at somebody. 
[02:14:30]  Boy, I wonder what they're going to like when a bulldozer hits them and their head explodes  like a ripe melon.  And, oh, boy, watching the little worms eat the brain.  I don't think that way.  Like, you know, when Lane Staley was in the house for a while.  There's a door in your head and you shut it.  No.  Oh, I like opening those doors.  You put a couple of bulldogs in front and when the door tries to open, you go, and you  stop it.  I just want to know, at Lane Staley's house, like, you know, at some point, because there 
[02:15:00]  was quite a few days had gone by, there was some point during all of those days where there  was that slight light blue light at about four in the morning that you get five in the  morning coming through the window where you could just see him laying there rotting as  the birds are going.  That's funny.  And I was a James fan.  And, like, the next day, the same thing.  And all day, he's just laying there, not moving. 
[02:15:30]  With an eye.  The sun high in the sky.  It's midday.  Maybe outside you hear.  With his eyes open.  Yeah.  The cars are going by.  Maybe you hear kids playing way far away.  And then nighttime comes along.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  The owl of the Pacific Northwest.  Hoo, hoo.  And then again, all night long.  Maybe it's pitch black.  Pitch blackness.  But he's still there.  And then blue again.  Awful.  Free ball of soup.  See?  It's kind of horrific when you think in those terms, isn't it? 
[02:16:00]  Hey, we're going to take a break.  Lewis Black in studio.  All righty.  He's playing Town Hall June 14th.  What a fun show.  It's tremendous.  Yeah, better take a break.  I agree with that.  What pissed you off today, my friend?  It's just part of the dark doors.  Like he says, you're supposed to leave those doors shut.  Sometimes it gets jammed open a lot.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program. 
[02:16:30]  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, everybody?  This is Patrice O'Neal, and it's the worst of Lucky Louie, Louie C.K. on the Opie and Anthony Show.  But Louie C.K. is a huge YouTube star, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Many YouTube clips now.  And everyone's telling us we've got to play the Catholic Church video.  It's a favorite.  I got the treat.  I got the special treat of seeing that.  That's right.  I showed it to you right after I finished cutting it. 
[02:17:00]  When Louie was in.  Showed me on the laptop.  Yeah.  And it's hysterical.  Jesus.  You're going with some sick shit.  So the other day, I'm just fucking around on YouTube, and I don't even know how I get  to certain places.  You know, you just kind of, you're on a road, and you don't know where you're going.  You just, you go, you watch one video, and then there's something in the sample window,  and you go, hey, let me see that.  Right.  And you go in a whole nother direction.  Well, I ended up on one of yours, and it's you stealing a child's ice cream and running  into a helicopter.  Yeah, and the helicopter takes off.  And the helicopter takes off.  Yeah.  How did you get permission to even do something that dangerous? 
[02:17:30]  Well, it was, we were using the helicopter for something else.  Oh, okay.  And so I had this idea, right before we take off, can I get this kid and I steal his ice cream  and then jump in a helicopter and have it take off.  The thing is, it took off before you were really secured in there.  Well, that's what the, the guy gave me a tutorial of how to get in the door and close it.  The cool get in as I'm taking off.  Oh, like an action figure.  Yeah.  Nice.  Action star.  You know how the dudes give you, you know, a safety thing.  You have to get in, you have to pull the latch 15 different ways and close it, and then 
[02:18:00]  strap in.  Before I take off, I have to see you strapped in, and I need to see a closed door.  Yeah.  The guy gave me a very authoritative voice.  That's what I need to see.  I do not lift off.  The sleds do not leave the ground until you are in and the door is shut.  And I said, it would look a lot cooler if you would take off the instant I'm even near  the helicopter.  Yeah.  And he said, all right, we'll do that.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  That's cool.  And I thought, the thing is, I was thinking like a guy shooting a comedy video. 
[02:18:30]  I wasn't thinking like the dude who has to do it, because I don't like heights.  I don't like-  Well, you picked a great gag.  I'm not a courageous dude.  And so it didn't hit me until I'm actually, I had a foot on the sled of the thing, and one  foot in, and he starts taking off.  And I was terrified.  Dude, that's what got me.  Like, the bit itself is funny.  I'm watching it.  It's funny.  Louie comes out.  There's a kid eating ice cream.  Louie, there's no real dialogue between you two.  It's just you, kind of music.  And then Louie kind of looks around, grabs the kid's ice cream, and runs. 
[02:19:00]  Here he is.  He licks it, runs.  And then I was totally taken out of it by feeling like you were going to die.  Yeah.  Can I-  Like, it's like, wait, Louie did that?  Wow, look at that.  You're like an action star.  And then the helicopter banks to the side of the door.  Yeah, banks to the side of the door.  So you could have flown right the fuck out of there.  I was looking down.  I was holding onto the seat, pushing, which, by the way, is Velcroed into the helicopter  very softly.  And I'm looking down at water.  Yeah, the thing turned like sideways. 
[02:19:30]  And all I see is just water.  It's just the East River.  It took me right out of the bit itself.  When I was looking, at that point, I just went, Louie just did a stunt.  It was crazy.  And then seconds later, we're over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Like, it takes like 10 seconds.  I gotta jump in, though.  You don't run like an action star.  No, I don't.  I run like a big, fat retard.  And you do what everyone does when they're approaching a helicopter.  You're crouching down.  Except for Vic Morrow.  He didn't do that.  Even though there's plenty of headroom, but we all have to crouch down. 
[02:20:00]  Look at him crouching down.  You're giving yourself a few extra inches.  Exactly.  Well, because in order to take off that fast, he had to be at, the rotors had to be at that speed.  That speed, yep.  It was incredibly loud, and it was, and he did that.  Yep.  And the kid, and nobody cared.  I was the only one who was like, can the kid be this close to a helicopter?  Yeah, it's by the water.  You could have blown him into the drink.  Were you scared over the bridge?  Yeah, that really bummed me out a lot.  But we did three takes, and by the third one, I was enjoying it. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, you were flying it by the third one.  Like, give me the stick.  You know what?  That's a cool YouTube video right now.  That is.  That's something different.  I like it.  It's funny, though, because there's a lot of comments on it, and some of them are like,  fuck this video.  I hate this video.  This was a waste of my time.  Every single video on YouTube has the, dude, this sucks.  It's a way.  You could videotape Jesus Christ coming back, walking on fucking water, and there will be that  guy, dude, this is such shit. 
[02:21:00]  This is so good.  This is why YouTube sucks.  Fake, fake, fake, so fake.  And then they'd be fake, fake, yeah.  Yeah.  It's the same comment.  Yes.  And then there's the, you know, dude, that's so funny, or this rules, you know, so talented,  that's great.  Yeah.  Dude, this is what YouTube, you know, it used to be cool.  There's another kind of YouTube, another comment that's on every YouTube thing that I have,  which is just a literal reaction to what was done.  Yeah.  Like, there's a few comments on that one that say, like, wow, he really, he took that ice 
[02:21:30]  cream and got in that helicopter.  Oh, wow.  He took it, ran.  Yeah, that seems like a lot of, he didn't need a whole helicopter to get away from that  child, did he?  Like, people literally.  Taking it literally.  And you're, and you're using a child actor, but some of these dummies, this one right  here, oh my God, that was so mean, I hope that was just a joke and you didn't really  just steal ice cream from a little boy making a dramatic escape on a helicopter just for  the heck of it, because that would be mean.  You get every, what it is, is you get the, a cross section of society. 
[02:22:00]  You get everything.  You're not just getting people that get a joke or have a sense of humor or are stuffy  business people.  It's everything.  So you'll get morons that think everything's real.  Yep.  You'll get the people that think everything's fake.  Well.  You'll get people that think everything's great.  Exactly.  Everything sucks.  Exactly.  No, the one that I have, the most innocuous video that I have on there, my dog fighting  with a sprinkler, it's been hit two million times.  People love animals.  Yeah, but.  And we wanted to. 
[02:22:30]  Why am I rich?  We want to show it at the virus tour, but we didn't, we can't get a good copy.  I don't have, I took it with a little digital camera.  Yeah.  So, but, but every, there's a bunch of people that are really mad at me because the name  of the video is Louis C.K.'s stupid dog.  And, because I call my dog stupid.  She's stupid.  She's a dog.  Of course.  And the video, just if you haven't checked it out yet, is Louis' dog kind of chasing after  a sprinkler.  It's just she's trying to drink from a high powered sprinkler.  I like to think that she's trying to eat it.  She's trying to eat it.  The, the, the velocity of the water is turning her head sideways every time she bites into 
[02:23:00]  it.  Ripping out teeth.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Watch.  Then she follows the thing.  She tries.  She's like, and then she goes.  Barks at it a little.  Yeah.  I'm done with it.  All right.  That hurts.  That's how we want to introduce you at the virus tour, but we don't have a good copy of  that.  Well, since I put, that one has more comments than anything else, and most of them are negative.  People saying, you shouldn't call your dog stupid.  You're stupid because you didn't give her enough water.  That's why she's doing that.  Dogs love things like that.  People saying you're wasting water. 
[02:23:30]  It's a fucking public park sprinkler near my house.  You got 6,300 comments and four honors, by the way.  What are the honors for the video there, Iraq?  Cruel.  Down, down, right there.  No, up.  Asshole.  Most fake video.  It's not even a real dog, dude.  Iraq.  It's the dog in the Pirates of the Caribbean that is holding the keys.  This one is on, also, it was on Keith Oberman on, uh, it was on television.  Oh, really?  I just read, somebody told me it was on television.  Iraq, honors.  You've never looked at honors on a video? 
[02:24:00]  Why would he know about honors?  Iraq, move the arrow to your left.  Iraq.  All right, now up.  Up.  Stop.  Directing his mouse.  To the right.  Higher.  Right.  Higher.  Down.  Down.  Why?  Down to the left.  Oh, my God.  Right there.  Right.  Oh, duh.  Oh, my God.  It's like a young, retarded child.  I didn't know you could have honors.  I don't even know what that is.  Honor.  Most discussed all-time comedy.  You're in 95th place.  Not bad. 
[02:24:30]  Recently featured, 66th place.  Wow, you're big in Poland.  Recently featured in Poland.  26th place, though.  Let's see what Polish videos are beating it right now.  Ah.  Wow.  All right, here's the Polish.  Quite a person doing the same thing.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  That's funny.  Polish people are watching it going, so that's how you drink from a sprinkler.  Well, you got the joy of shaving, beating you. 
[02:25:00]  Go to the first page.  Joy of shaving.  First page there.  Polish videos.  We just featured in Poland.  Wow, I can't speak Polish.  You speak Polish?  Oh.  Tesla.  That's what you were.  Tesla coil at Duxin 2007.  Tesla.  South Bank juggling.  Ararat video.  Ah, whatever.  I guess this is funny.  Ah, crap.  We were hoping.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Sorry.  Damn.  How many hits, though?  That one at over 2 million.  Jesus. 
[02:25:30]  It's getting close to 3 now.  I think it's like 20, isn't it 2.4 million now?  Wow.  Oh, you're checking every day, aren't you, Louie?  Oh, yeah.  We do that.  We do that.  How many do I have?  Put my Vista in.  Louie's got 2.5.  Damn it.  Put my Vista in.  How many?  How many?  Anthony had a viral video, too, there, Louie.  He's up to...  What?  What?  1.7, son of a bitch.  1.7.  Good.  What kind of faggot video is that?  1.7.  I know.  1.8 almost.  Let's call it 1.8.  It's my Vista when I was loading Vista in on my Dell computer. 
[02:26:00]  The biggest Opie and Anthony video so far on the video.  Oh, yeah.  And the comments on that one are great because it's like, all right, Mac fan boy, won't  you blow it out your ass, you sissy, with your Mac.  And then it's like, you know, and then the PC people are even like, you know, you can't  figure out how to do it.  You know, you got to run the test first to see if your computer's compatible, asshole.  And I'm like, dude, I know about computers.  I did everything.  I bought a computer that was a Dell computer that was Vista ready. 
[02:26:30]  It said Vista ready, but Vista wasn't ready yet.  So they go, when Vista comes out, you load it in, and you're Vista ready.  I go to load it in, wouldn't fucking load, no drivers for it, and people go, well, it's  not Dell's or Vista's fault, ass.  It's your cards, your video cards didn't have the drivers ready for Vista.  Well, then Vista ain't fucking ready to come out.  It was working before Vista, didn't work after.  It's Vista's fucking fault, not NVIDIA, you fucker.  I hate that.  And they make it sound like, you know, well, he must have a real piece of shit. 
[02:27:00]  Dude, I buy and sell your fucking piece of shit computers on a weekly basis.  I'm sorry, I have to bring my wealth into this.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Most people were with you.  The thing is, people think, this is what I've learned from it, because the Catholic  one I did got the most negative response, because it's very inflammatory.  Well, of course.  But even the one I did one about my father, this whole thing where it's a cartoon.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one's good.  It's just a cartoon of how I can do anything in a cartoon, but it mostly becomes about  confronting my father. 
[02:27:30]  And I get a lot of people saying, you know, you should leave your dad alone.  He probably did his best.  The thing is, I think people's problems is that it's okay to get offended by stuff you  see, but because people get to comment, they think they're being offended should matter.  Right.  And it just fucking doesn't.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  If you're offended, nobody has to give a shit that you don't like something.  Yeah.  You can just sit there and not like it and go fuck yourself.  That's why I like that they have comments for people's comments.  Yeah.  Like you can take his comment and then people get ragged on their comments. 
[02:28:00]  It's like, good.  See, you said fuck you.  Now these people are telling you, go fuck yourself on your comment.  Who animated that?  Because that looked like you.  A great guy.  His name is Aaron Ogoblick.  Did he do the credits?  He did.  No, no.  That's David Trisman for Lucky Louie.  But this guy, he does a show called Wonder Shows on MTV.  That's really funny.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's so funny.  It's like, I can fly.  And then it's me telling my father that I don't appreciate his...  Dude, I got something to do.  I can do everything in a cartoon, you know, because I'm a cartoon character. 
[02:28:30]  So he starts doing all these fun things in a cartoon.  And then it always ends up him having some awful confrontation thing with his father.  Yeah.  Stuff that I'm too afraid to have.  Is that worth it?  In real life.  Is that worth playing?  Audio-wise?  Nah, because it's all about the graphic.  No, you got to say it.  You need a cartoon.  Okay.  The Catholic one's the best one, especially since we're on XM.  I'm going to give you the big plug.  This is what I'm doing tonight.  I'm going to watch all the Louis C.K. videos on YouTube.  Definitely.  If you go to YouTube.com and then it's just slash Louis C.K., then that's my channel. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing that it takes like four minutes to set up and you have your own channel.  Your own channel.  Hey, whatever you want to say.  And it has the same bandwidth and strength as like NBC.com.  Yeah.  That's why the internet scares the shit out of these people.  Yeah.  Oh, this is fucking up to you, man.  All you need is a little push, you know, some, you know, people to catch on to it.  You get huge amounts of hits.  People see things more than they see some TV shows.  Especially if you don't charge money.  Because as soon as I see that I got to pay for something on the internet, goodbye.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:29:30]  It's the best of the worst of the comedians of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I always acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian...  Carrot Top.  And now we say good morning to Carrot Top in studio.  Yes.  You're over here in the lounging chair.  Yeah.  You're sitting on the lounging chair. 
[02:30:00]  This is nice.  Yeah.  It's gigantic.  It's a nice setup.  He's just...  I'm looking at his tricep.  I'm like, he's huge.  If he backhands me, I'm dead.  I want to see Carrot Top...  You're carrying crap around all day.  I want to see you just drill your fist right...  I tell you, I mean...  If any works out a little bit, I think you could take it.  I could probably take the shot, but I don't know if I want to.  No, you don't.  Gigantic.  Yeah, right?  What's he going to do to you, right?  How old are you?  42.  42?  How old are your biceps?  Brand new? 
[02:30:30]  No, this is a lot of...  This is a lot of work of...  This is a lot of...  I was always an athlete as a kid, but I mean, yeah, it's every day.  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah, it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work.  People tell me I have a gym body, but I mean, like, when I look at you, I'm like, that's  where the guy...  Jesus.  Jim J.I.M.  Oh, yeah.  It's me.  I have to sit up because they're putting a camera on me.  I don't want to look like a...  I don't want to look like you, Norton.  No, there's nothing you could do to look like you're in any kind of shit.  It really is.  He's dwarfing you right now, Vinny.  He is a midget. 
[02:31:00]  Vinny Brandy is a fucking midget.  You are a midget.  He's just fucking...  You're jacked up.  When did you start doing that?  The smaller ass day.  Just, yeah.  It took that quick.  I lived it my whole life.  I just think people are taking notice to it because I was always, you know, I just bought  smaller shirts.  They come in men's.  Smaller shirts?  Yeah, that's the way.  That's the best way.  I remember years ago watching you, though, and not recalling such big arms.  I tried to wear as big a shirt, too, because I knew how to use fucking shit for it all.  Right.  I'd wear a big shirt.  The growth is a little Barry Bonds-like in terms of it.  No, that's so funny, but yeah, nothing. 
[02:31:30]  Nothing?  You've never done the roids?  No.  No roids?  No bonnet douche?  No bonnet...  No.  But I saw him, and he was like, how do you keep on doing this?  He's already got the veins pop on his forehead.  He was actually injecting while he was talking to me.  How the fuck do you get this?  That's strange.  Some guy actually said that, though, at Mandalay Bay Poole.  Hey, it's Bonaduce.  And I was like, fuck.  Damn it.  That's the first time in my life someone's ever said that, so I need to stop training or something.  Can you even scratch your back anymore?  I mean...  I'm not back. 
[02:32:00]  It's those three shows Saturday night with all those crunks.  Slip my sweaty balls.  Yeah.  Sweaty balls.  You must be just sick of it, though.  Like, everybody's got to be like, hey, Carrot Top, you're big.  Yeah, they do.  You ought to just really start punching people that say that.  That would be great.  It's like, don't ask fucking Carrot Top anything about his muscles.  He punches you in the face.  We took a pic together at Tough Crowd when he did Tough Crowd, and you're wearing an open  shirt, and just the definition on your pecs, and I'm just standing there like such a non-man, 
[02:32:30]  just like a little fat-faced fan.  Something a little uncomfortable about you looking at the definition on his pecs.  I was feeling all good about me.  Your arm looks like Carrot Top's cock.  It was just showing off his bicep there.  Yeah.  It was impressive until he walked in the room.  Fuck, Carrot Top.  That's great, man.  What the fuck, man?  That happens.  I'm carrying all my hate mail around, you know.  That must be it.  Yeah.  You've caught a lot of shit throughout the years, man, right?  You've caught a lot of bullshit.  Oh, absolutely. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  You know, what the fuck?  You're going to catch a lot of shit during his 40-year career in comedy.  We were talking about that.  You're going to, anyhow, you're not going to please everybody, so get your fan.  Well, in a way, we can understand it's, we, being shock jocks, being shock jocks, have  taken some shit in New York, especially with the elite of New York radio.  They, like, don't like what we do.  They consider it a little lowbrow and things like that, and they're constantly bashing  us on message boards and things like that, and then they, you realize, we've been here 
[02:33:30]  like fucking 10 years, you know?  In New York alone.  Yeah, so, you know, if we got fired tomorrow, they couldn't say anything, but still, it's  like, hey, fucking failures.  Yeah.  You know, the fucking guy's going to be out of here in a month, I bet.  I get it all the time.  People are like, there'll be a comic in the club.  He'll be playing in the state theater right around the corner from me.  Never comes to say hello.  Doesn't know me.  Doesn't matter.  But there's 1,800 people.  They're lined up everywhere, and I got some guy with 104 people in my room.  He's like, hey, prop guy.  Why don't you find some props, jerk-off, because I can't put my kids through college on 
[02:34:00]  your numbers.  You're fucking killing me.  But please write some prop jokes.  Props get a bad, it's like anything else you do in comedy.  It's almost like me and Colin were talking one time about like planes.  I'm like, yeah, man, I can't even do this plane joke or McDonald's or whatever.  He goes, why the fuck not?  Like, why would you allow the hacks to hijack every subject like that if you got something  original?  So it's the same with props.  Because so many shitty prop acts.  Right.  It's like a guy that's really good at it.  Yeah, it did get a stigma of just like being a hack because so many hacks would come out  and try to do prop acts. 
[02:34:30]  Well, you know, I tell the guys, the elite guys, I'll say, okay, well, write a couple  jokes.  It's so easy to do.  Write some prop jokes for me right now.  Here's some shit.  Write some jokes.  Do what you feel like.  How bad is he?  Do it.  Fucking do it.  But it gave me literally shit, which is hard to work with.  Well, it pisses people off because I'll be like, oh, what, you know.  And they get mad at me because I'm like, listen, if a guy does what he does and he's good  at what he does, leave him the fuck alone.  The guy's filling a theater and you can't write what he's writing.  Carrotop's here.  We like to talk about it.  I'm also afraid.  That's why I'm saying this shit.  Let me explain before Carrotop talks.  He's my spokesperson. 
[02:35:00]  Why did he steal his way until he sat next to Vinny's room right now?  This is what Vinny's, he's trying to book him at his club.  Yes, he is.  Exactly what he's trying to do.  He's not harassing you, but I defended you.  You're so full of shit.  Let me tell you something.  He's filling the state theater.  If he wasn't this fucking big, I'd be trashing him right now.  Oh, you fool of a shit.  I don't want him in the club, you phony cunt.  He can't fit in the club.  Exactly.  If he's trying to do it in my club, there's no room.  Vinny, he could be raping children if he fills the state theater.  You fuck him at the club, you fucking phony. 
[02:35:30]  Listen up, you're a good child raper and you're good at it.  You're probably saying to that guy with the 104 seats, no, but you know, just keep doing  what you're doing.  No, there's 104 seats.  I never tell them to keep doing what they're doing.  Change what you're doing.  How long was the phone call that night?  So you're doing, you're like, you're selling, you're still selling a lot of tickets, man.  Because you were like, it was known that you were like a fucking over a million dollar  a year college act.  I mean, he was fucking making huge money before he was truly a famous guy.  Well, Vegas, I'm just there every night now. 
[02:36:00]  We just do the Vegas thing now.  It's great.  Yeah.  Wow.  What is that like though?  Do you just like totally avoid the casino at this point?  Yeah, for the most part you do.  I mean, unless you, you know, when I hit the clubs, you know.  Yeah.  But usually I do the show and you go home.  Or the Bunny Ranch.  I've heard.  The Bunny Ranch.  Yeah.  It's always fun.  It's a little far from Vegas, but.  You fuck a lot of broads there?  I'm going to pull a train with Carrot Top.  Carrot Top.  I won't be the lead.  I'll just take your fucking, I'll take what he's done with because I don't want to fucking  follow that.  You know, Regis, they asked me the same thing yesterday.  Regis was like.  Yeah, yeah.  Talk about the Bunny Ranch. 
[02:36:30]  How many girls do you fuck over there?  Tell me, Carrot Top.  Do you pull out the props when you bagger these chicks?  Regis.  I do.  He's just.  You should have pulled out on Regis' show.  A healthy heart.  You're awful.  What the hell is that thing?  There ain't one stitch in that. 
[02:37:00]  You live in Vegas?  Yeah.  Makes it a little easier.  You must have a nice spread out there.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all right.  I bet you it's pretty impressive.  You live near anybody?  Michael Jackson.  Really?  Not a joke.  Yeah, like two streets over.  I thought he lived in the Middle East.  He lives in, he lives, no, he lives in North Central Vegas.  So that was all fake footage?  You know, I don't know.  So they just got him out in the sand?  Yeah.  Said he was in Saudi Arabia.  He's actually in Vegas.  That's the word on the street that he's got a, that's his house, so you can see the 
[02:37:30]  Ferris wheel and it's kind of weird.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You're going to be testifying soon.  What did you see coming out of the house?  A little hairlish Asian boy.  Vietnamese boys.  Explain to us with this toilet bowl with wheels.  Could you just tell us what happened?  No, it would be a stock cage with a tear bucket.  That's what Michael uses it.  What, how long ago and, and what, what made you just decide, I'm going to put these two 
[02:38:00]  things together, take it on stage?  I'm not a good comic like these, these other comics, the stand-ups.  And I, and I knew that right away.  I was just, I had the visual thing.  Did you try it on stage?  Like regular straight stand-up comedy?  Yeah, I was straight stand-up and, um, I had like one or two props and it turned out  to be, but it worked.  It was like a neighborhood crime watch sign or something.  And I had, hey, how good is the crime watch?  They're not watching their signs, you know.  All right, that's good.  Fucking sign.  That's good.  Jackson, the lady that used to book a club who now, I think, manages Larry the Cable  Guy or something.  So it's interesting. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, he's making shit money.  Yeah, I'm talking about money.  Yeah, I'm making shit.  Yeah, poor guy.  We should have a benefit for him.  You've got to make 50, 60 bucks a night.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  Yeah, a lot of dough.  So I don't know, just got to work down is what it was, you know.  I had a billion comics saying, lose the fucking props.  And I'm like, I'm carrying him.  You don't have to worry about it.  Do you still make these things yourself, or do you just design them and have somebody  else build them for you?  Yeah, I would.  There's like this fucking, I just picture the Carrot Top Factory, like you're sitting  there drawing up these blueprints that are all, it started out with you just in the garage. 
[02:39:00]  It's really just not that exciting.  It's just duct tape and glued on and tried.  Yeah.  I used to remember the legendary Wood, who's another prop actor that comedians love, and  he's just a fucking animal.  Yeah.  He just throws his shit all over the floor.  People want to punch him in the face like that they're so good, because he's like aggressive  with the audience.  He's like, he's holding a strainer over his head, and he goes, I'm under a fucking  strain.  Yeah, he's a laugh.  I'm under a fucking strain.  You look back on props, acts, jokes that you did at the beginning and think, oh, that  sucked.  How did I do that?  Because comics look back and they say, you know, that sucked when I did that. 
[02:39:30]  Why explain to him what comics do you mean?  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  I don't like to ask straight questions, but I want to know, does he look back and tell  that?  I think he ever looks back and says, yeah, my writing's gotten better or clever.  I don't know.  It was a serious question.  It was a great question, Vinny.  Yeah, let me ask you another question.  It's a great question, Vinny.  We're having a lot of laughs here.  You just decided to turn it in to meet the press?  Why don't you go back in the glass booth for a little while?  Exactly.  Take a time out, will you?  Time out for Vinny.  Time out for Vinny.  It hurts.  Your mic's off.  Goodbye.  Let me ask you another fun Vinny question. 
[02:40:00]  Caratop.  The laughs covered the tears.  It's a comedian.  It's just a fucking comic.  I know.  I wanted to know.  Well, you know what?  It's like you became, I mean, just the name alone was such a, it's like, people recognize  that name, Caratop.  Everybody knows the name Caratop.  It's a fucking comedian.  I mean, people that don't know comic names recognize that name, even if they don't know  the material, haven't seen the act.  Right.  All right.  That wasn't a question.  No, that really wasn't.  Not only was it a statement.  It was a statement.  It was not funny as anything I see. 
[02:40:30]  I think early on in the club, like, you want everyone to like you.  You go to a comic, you go there, you want the comics to like, you want to get booked.  So there's a lot of clubs that didn't book me because I did props.  I'd kill and they'd say, he does props, he's not going to play this club.  So that kind of stuff earlier on, you're like, this sucks.  And then you move on.  Like you said, you play state theater and well, fuck you, you won't book me your club.  I'm going to play the theater.  Like, you don't get enough attention with the hair and the biceps that you paint your fingernails  black.  I actually shaved my nuts for this, too.  Did you shave your nuts, too? 
[02:41:00]  I don't pay off there, but I did.  I have no idea.  You just decided.  I don't care about anything.  You just want to.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about anything.  I don't care about anything.  I didn't have shit for what I do anyhow.  No one's going to say, oh, and now he paints his nails, too.  No, you could fucking, you could do anything.  If you dress like Oscar De La Hoya, no one would give a flying fuck if you were in a tutu and  a little...  Those photos of me will surface soon, so...  Are there? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  We all have them somewhere, don't we?  If you're a rock star, it's like, wow, this guy's really eccentric and he's really cool.  But if you're a comic, people are like, have you lost your fucking life?  Yeah, it's true.  Did, uh, what the fuck?  Oh, yeah, the roast.  That, uh, you did for, um...  That's more like your kind of stuff.  That was not...  I think that's why they had me there.  The flavor, flavor, flavor, roast.  Yeah, I mean, the roast in general was like, how many times did you say black pussy?  Yeah.  Did you want to kill Greg Giraldo?  Did you want to fucking...  I actually like...  I think he's very funny.  He's one of my favorite, like, roasters when I was.  Yeah.  He's very funny.  But he was, like, giving you some shit. 
[02:42:00]  Well, sure, yeah.  Yeah.  But you're going to get shit.  I'll take shit for, like, you work out or something.  When they say, oh, something stupid, like, look at his fucking face.  What the fuck is his face?  Look at it.  What the fuck happened to you?  You're like, what the fuck's wrong with my face?  And you start thinking...  Or you can rip my axe, because that's pretty common.  But I guess you're looking like I look like...  Yeah, you went for a new angle.  That's right.  Roasts are fucking, like, brutal.  No, it's brutal.  It was all me for the first...  It's all been edited.  The first hour was just me.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I think we're roasting him.  I think when you get a bunch of comics like that together... 
[02:42:30]  I knew it was going to happen.  And they talk about you when you're not there.  When you're there in a roast atmosphere, it's like you just fucking...  Yeah, it's brutal.  You were there.  No, it's brutal.  Are you talking about this clip?  Yeah, I walk up...  Oh, great.  Oh, you got a clip?  That's nice.  Oh, fucker.  You are a big, ghoulish woman.  I'm talking to you, Carrot Top.  A ghoulish woman.  Jesus.  What happened to your face?  Jesus.  You look retarded. 
[02:43:00]  How did you do that?  Right.  How did you find a plastic surgeon who could add a chromosome?  He's calling you a retard.  Well, it was funny.  I mean, I will sass that back there and said that was funny.  You appreciate the brutality as a comic.  Everyone got ripped on.  Everyone got ripped on.  Yeah, that roast was unreal.  But if you look at those old roasts that they had when it was Dean Martin and stuff, dude,  it was nothing like they were.  No, they've gotten back.  It was gentle ribbing. 
[02:43:30]  Well, they...  Right.  But now it's just like, your mother's a cunt.  It's just...  Woo!  Right, right.  True.  It is.  And they would co-sign for each other's stuff back then.  Like, who was the guy who always pretended he was drunk?  Foster Brooks.  Foster Brooks.  They would all laugh and stuff, right?  Today, Patrice would get up.  You're not drunk!  You're not drunk!  Yeah, just sell him out in front of everybody.  Just fucking...  Speaking of that, did you guys see on YouTube that clip of Jamie Foxx just trashing that 
[02:44:00]  guy while the guy was trying to roast somebody?  No.  Oh, my God.  He kills him.  Jamie Foxx was the host of it, so he had a lapel mic that was on, and this dude came  up.  It was like an Emmett Smith roast, and he starts bombing, and Jamie starts speaking into his mic.  Oh, shit.  Doing the guy's inner thoughts, like, I just told another joke that didn't work.  Maybe I should just get off.  It was hilarious, but it was one of the most brutal things I've ever seen.  I got to see that one.  Here it is, right?  I want to actually see a YouTube video of Bill Burr watching YouTube videos. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that's all I do.  You seem to know every fucking video.  Dude, if you want any slap fight or any animal thing, I watched them all.  You know them all.  I've watched them all.  Yeah.  Love them.  We'll get that on the radio in a minute or two, because it's really long.  Let's say hi to Greg in California.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, not much.  Carrot Top, I've got to congratulate you on one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on TV.  You kissed Gene Simmons on national TV.  That was awesome.  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  On his show?  You did. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  They just were doing some stupid, you know.  Family values.  That's when I painted my nails that day.  Oh, okay.  Now it all makes sense.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  They kept saying, we're doing these intros, you know, the Gene Simmons thing.  Kiss him on lips?  No.  I said, we were doing like little bumpers for the show.  And I said, listen, I'll be upstairs or something.  And they kept doing something stupid.  They said, keep fucking with him.  Keep fucking with him.  So what else do I do?  Yeah.  I said, I'll be upstairs.  I was going to come out completely naked because there was only like 10 people there.  And I was going to come out and say, I'll stay upstairs or something. 
[02:45:30]  And I kissed him on the back of his ear.  And he was like, what the fuck?  And he really wasn't happy with it.  No.  No.  He's kind of looking at me like, you don't fucking kiss Gene Simmons.  I'm like, your producer said to do it.  He said, push it furthest I can push it.  So does that or blow you?  You're giving the choice.  You're watching A&E.  I didn't do that.  Let's go to Catherine in Atlanta.  Catherine, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, Carrot Top, I have to tell you, you did the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life 
[02:46:00]  at Georgia Center.  Oh, I kissed Gene Simmons.  Back in like 92 or something.  Jesus.  That's when I was funny.  That's it.  That's it, 92.  What was it?  What was it?  He smashed his watermelon.  No, he ordered a pizza from Domino's in Statesboro, Georgia.  And our local pizza guy was like a retarded guy.  And he came up on stage.  Carrot Top made him wear a pair of women's underwear.  I have funny with the retards.  All right.  I do remember that.  So you took advantage of a retarded person on stage. 
[02:46:30]  It's the funniest thing you've ever done.  And it was in 92.  Thank you.  What a backhanded compliment that cunt just gave you.  Oh, good, 92.  Not since then you've done much, but 92 is really great.  You did the funniest thing.  I walked into your dressing room and the retarded pizza guy was there and you were fingering  his ass and you and your whole crew were laughing at him.  That retarded pizza boy is still in Carrot Top's trailer.  It was every show.  It was 1989.  Get the retarded pizza boy.  We stiffed him on the pizza.  It was a rough night for him.  We called him. 
[02:47:00]  We paid him and he ate the money.  That's all right.  And he cried and punched himself.  He told his parents came.  Some people don't understand what a compliment is.  Yeah.  Some fucking guy over the weekend.  I forgot where it was.  It might have been Riley's when I was over there over the weekend.  Comes up and he's saying some shit like, he goes, man, I loved your show.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  He goes, when you guys were at NEW, that was when you guys were so fucking funny.  I was like, thanks.  He goes, you guys used to be like so fuck. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Shut the fuck up.  That was five years ago.  Thanks, buddy.  And the guy wouldn't even tell you.  He goes, no, it's like so much shit and stuff that you can't do.  He goes, you guys, man, we're so fucking don't want to hear how funny I was.  God, what a douche.  They say, even in the casino, they go, you know, I hate you.  I've always hated you.  You're annoying.  I don't like you.  But I came because my wife wanted me to come.  And it was really better than I thought it was going to be.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  What the fuck was that?  It didn't totally suck.  I have to set it up.  I fucking hate you, first of all.  Yeah.  Let's set some standards.  Nothing.  I don't like anything about you.  You're stupid.  You know, all that.  Yeah.  But you did have fun.  He goes, all right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was just okay.  Yeah, thanks.  Hey, Billy wants in here.  Billy in New York.  What's up?  Hey, Carrot Top.  I'm a huge fan, dude.  I thought you were great as fucking Rocky Dennis in the mask, you retarded ginger.  Oh, jeez.  Motherfucker. 
[02:48:30]  To make Rocky Dennis jokes is always appropriate.  And then you see how quickly he hung up because he was afraid you would somehow be able to punch  him through the phone?  That's great.  I'll fucking find him.  I'll find him.  Yeah, he'll get him.  Track him down.  Has it ever gotten to you really badly?  Any bullshit like where it's like, all right, man, this is fucking hurtful?  Oh, no, not really, no.  He doesn't care about anything.  He doesn't give a flying fuck anymore.  No, Dennis Miller one time was kind of giving me a lot.  Back in the day, I opened for him and I was at a college. 
[02:49:00]  And I got there and it was at Wake Forest or something.  And they said, you got to do 30 minutes.  And I said, I got 20, maybe.  And 15 was okay.  So I said, I'll do, I'll stretch.  So I get there and I look in the wings and he's standing there.  I remember thinking, oh, God damn, it's Dennis Miller.  He's only, he's little.  I remember thinking, oh, fucking little he is.  So I'm doing my thing.  I'm looking over and he's just pacing and he's doing like, what the fuck?  And I'm looking.  I said, I've only been up here like nine minutes.  So he's like, come on.  And the guy's like, get off.  So I'm like, leave all my shit here.  He's like, just get off. 
[02:49:30]  So I walked off and I said, walk by him.  And he says, you went too fucking long.  As he walked by him, he did his set.  He didn't feel good that night.  He kept checking on the Braves game.  He kept saying, where's the Braves and the so-and-so winning?  And it was whatever series that was.  And I came off and I said, Dennis, it was great.  And he says, get a, first thing you do is buy a fucking watch and don't go watch your time.  And I said, I was supposed to just do 30 minutes.  I did 10.  What a douche.  Now then, but later on he came back and he was like, hey, what's up, Doppler?  You know how he is.  Yeah.  Hey.  I said, I never went long though.  Did he get out on stage? 
[02:50:00]  I wanted to be clear with you that I did.  But no, he went on every show for about a year saying, it's Mike Doppler.  The guy took longer than Pederocles took to conquer the Venetia Lufins.  What?  What?  Standing over here like.  The crowd didn't quite get him.  Yeah.  It was because I was holding up.  Hey, look at the boot with the kickstand.  It was easy.  It's shiny.  Look.  And they're like, yeah, it's college.  Hit a pinwheel.  Yeah.  For 10 minutes.  He gets up there.  He's all smug. 
[02:50:30]  I'm standing there like fucking quick quake for Christ's sake.  I feel like it's 1540 and I'm here in the fucking, what?  Well, we made up.  We made up.  He's a good guy.  Oh, did you?  Can't top her with a shitty head shake.  Fuck you.  Fuck him.  He's a fucking button bottom suit.  Fuck him unless he's on this show.  Absolutely.  That's what we say.  I didn't like the way he didn't defend the O&A thing.  I didn't like the way he didn't defend the show.  Well, it's not like it's the freedom of speech.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:51:00]  That is a great, what, Center Square, right?  In Hollywood Square, as you just did.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Charles Nelson Miller.  No.  He's Michael J. Fox, Miller.  Hey, how you doing?  I don't have power to fuck you.  Yes, Samantha.  Yeah, he trashed us, too.  Yeah, I know he did.  We were in our latest problem there.  Like it wasn't a real freedom of speech.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock, really fast.  Sandy Cain's here.  Did you meet Sandy Cain in the green room?  I did not.  Hope not.  She was allegedly raped by Phil Spector back in the day.  She's an old, like, burlesque dancer. 
[02:51:30]  She's been doing our show for years, but she's, uh...  Let's bring her in.  She's crazy.  Well, but, uh...  Really, literally.  A little observation.  I guess the K-Rock people are going into the green room.  Why?  They heard her coming in, and people from K-Rock have been peeking into the green room.  She's just sitting there staring at the wall.  Eh, eh.  So people have just been peeking their head in to see what she's doing.  She hasn't moved.  You want to bring her in real fast?  Yeah.  Bring in Sandy Cain.  Where are you putting her?  My play-o.  No.  She's not going to hurt you.  No, no, no, no, no.  She goes back by E-Rock. 
[02:52:00]  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, just sit on Karatot's lap.  I'm like over there.  Oh, God.  Yeah, she's got to make sure she's far away from me.  Is she going to do a little thing on the stripper pole?  We got a mic?  Like she used to.  What mic were you using?  Years ago.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Bye, Vinny.  Sorry, Vinny.  Vinny's going to the bullpen.  Why are you taking Vinny's mic?  Vinny, you can move over there to E-Rock's mic.  Yeah, move over to E-Rock's mic.  Just because we're keeping Sandy Cain away from everybody. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, we want to keep her away.  Is she here or what?  She gets crazy.  Bring her in.  She was in the far away green room.  Oh, okay.  She's sitting there like Billy Bob in the beginning of Sling Blade.  Staring out that window.  Billy Bob.  She used to dance in Times Square when Times Square was really seedy and bottomless and  shit like way back in the 70s.  The good old days.  Yeah, the good old days.  You know, it's like the new world down there, right?  I know.  I like the fun old days.  Look at her.  Here she is.  Oh, wow.  Wow, Sandy.  Now I can see why I raped her. 
[02:53:00]  How have you been?  Okay, I'm still breathing here.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Hi, Cowatown.  How are you?  Wow, all right.  All right.  Yeah.  I brought dildo with me.  You're like cauliflower top.  Cauliflower top.  My titties were sweaty in the green room.  Evil can evil and Dolly Parton fuck.  I didn't hear that.  See, he doesn't need props.  No, he puts things together.  You just put that together. 
[02:53:30]  He's perfect at putting things together.  That's why I brought dildo with me because I need protection here.  Is that the name of your dog?  I brought dildo with me.  Yeah, we know about dildo.  You always bring dildo with you.  It really is a dildo.  She sounds like a character actor from the 70s.  No, I don't want that.  Don't even try.  Stay there or Steve will.  Is it Vandova?  Well, you got to put the mic by your mouth.  You can't talk into a dildo.  No, don't.  The microphone.  The collagen is interfering with the microphone. 
[02:54:00]  Which one's the dick?  Is it a mic or a dick?  Her hat just fell off her head.  I wish her head was in it.  Her hat actually jumped out of the leg.  I think I've got the wig stain there.  It just keeps moving.  Oh, my God.  Jump.  I know I'm doing this movie about Dolly Parton.  Oh, you are?  Yeah, I wanted to do this song called Rock Around Dolly Parton's Twat. 
[02:54:30]  So I'm wondering if that's possible to do that.  Is that possible?  But we don't believe you're actually doing a Dolly Parton movie.  Yeah, it's set in 2018.  It's called Parton, me, Dolly.  Dolly, we got to go back to the future.  Hey, you know, she's a big star.  In this one, she gets run over by the DeLorean.  So let me do that song, Rock Around Dolly Parton's Twat.  We'll let you get to the song.  It's been a twat-o, it's twat. 
[02:55:00]  It's been so long since we've seen you.  I know.  I'm the same.  I'm the same, you know.  Well, not really.  I'm not?  Yeah.  Why not, Opie?  A few more miles on you.  They're all bad miles.  Ah!  Oh, God.  I have that hemorrhoid, and I never let anyone fuck me in my asshole.  Wow.  Okay.  Do you really have a roid?  Jesus.  He doesn't believe you have a roid.  Wait, could you show Carrot Top?  Hey, hey, hey.  Which one?  She has a few hemorrhoids? 
[02:55:30]  Carrot Top.  She's got a, uh...  I got a hemorrhoid, but it really works for me.  It's a genital wart.  I never let any man fuck me in my asshole.  And even when they raped me, I said, no, please don't.  You know what I mean?  Listen.  You know what, you look like a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader opened the Ark of the Covenant.  They made it, that's why they made the cheerleaders move away from the other team's sidelines. 
[02:56:00]  Sandy.  Sandy Kane.  Show Carrot Top Twato.  And show Vinny.  Vinny has not seen it.  Just move.  Vinny, man.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Vinny.  Vinny.  Is it Jewish?  Is it Jewish?  Is it Jewish?  Do the name like that?  Are you Jewish?  Vibrating.  Yeah.  Is he serving sides?  I love how she's doing like this.  Enough dildo.  Look how she's doing this porno humor.  And then like her jokes are from 1912.  I love humor, man.  Funny is funny, as Buddy Hackett would say.  Exactly. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  If he wasn't dead.  I understand.  Hold on, hold on.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  He wants to do my big titties, man.  I want to see your hemorrhoid, do I?  Okay.  Yes.  I brought my big titties.  Sandy!  Kane!  Fuck.  Show Carrot Top Twato.  It's XM, right?  Twat.  Cunt.  Steve, will you control this beast?  I love words like that.  Show him Twato.  Twato.  Remember Twato?  I forgot how frustrating she could be.  Now she'll just take pictures.  Hey, Jim.  Remember when you were first getting into the clubs in New York? 
[02:57:00]  This is the kind of person you'd run into in, like, the New York comedy club.  Okay, Jim, what do you want me to say about you?  Show him.  No, show Twato.  Where's Twato on the front?  You do Crack?  Who does Crack?  Oh, we do.  Play along.  Play along.  Remember Twato in the front?  Let me see Twato.  I haven't seen Twato in years.  Show Carrot Top.  I'm not looking.  Come over and look at it.  Not too close.  Right there is good.  Right there.  Right there is great. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, right there is good.  Right there.  Carrot Top.  Boy, I can't wait to tell my family.  Look at what this is.  Don't freak me out.  It'll freak out.  Okay, where is it?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Did I bring it?  Move your hand.  Uh-oh.  It's okay.  I got my O.B. and Anthony G-string.  Move your hand.  Show.  I got my O.B. and Anthony G-string.  It's the worst thing in life.  All right.  No, pull that aside.  No, show.  Show Twato.  Why would you look at that?  No, it's not embarrassing.  That's what I want to know. 
[02:58:00]  Why would anybody look at that?  Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  It's a pop.  I was going to die a few years ago when they had the doctor show.  Remember?  Oh, my God.  We're still here.  Wait, wait.  Carrot Top has.  There's Phil Spector's pistol when you need it.  Right?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Carrot Top, comment?  I thought it was going to be a cock you were going to pull out of there.  Oh, yeah.  It's like an ear.  No, well.  Did it get bigger?  Did anyone see it?  It's big.  That has seen it in the old days?  Yeah, it's pretty big.  Same size? 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Go back by the mic.  Get it back by the mic over there.  No, no, no.  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'll kill you.  I don't even know what that is.  That may be the nastiest thing I've ever seen.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the weird thing, too.  As it got closer.  We're here, man.  Jesus, you said I'd make it.  As it got closer?  It's the whole thing.  It's the whole thing.  Yeah, the whole package.  The whole thing.  No, the whole thing.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Shut up.  Her genital wart looks like something that SETI uses to search for extra intelligence.  One of those giant things that Jodie Foster should stand under. 
[02:59:00]  That'd be kind of hot, though.  It's just like you're eating her out and just kind of suck on that thing.  We had a guy come in and do that.  Yeah, I actually did have a guy.  From the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, Paul Lowe.  Because why wouldn't we?  With something available like that, it's a prop.  Carrot Top, can you tape something to that and somehow come up with a closing bit?  We should give Carrot Top 10 minutes in the green room.  10 minutes and some duct tape.  Yeah, 10 minutes.  You got duct tape in that.  Go.  Is the hair on your dick red like that or what? 
[02:59:30]  It doesn't look anything like yours.  Yeah.  I have red, red hair.  Oh, God.  Oh, my.  Hold on.  She keeps it nice and quaffed.  I know.  It's a little bit like Opie's hair.  She's in great shape.  Even if you keep yourself in great, you look horrific.  How old are you really?  I'm a woman of the 90s, 93.  How old is the general goiter?  It's huge.  You know how I really think I got it?  I was shaving.  I was working at this place called Las Vegas Bar. 
[03:00:00]  It was totally nude.  You couldn't even wear socks or an anklet.  And I was waiting for 40 seconds.  You woke up and he had it on you?  And I shaved, and then all of a sudden, that growth came.  Couldn't wear socks.  I'm pretty sure that's how it happened.  I wasn't born with it, man.  Right after shaving, did you fuck a motorcycle gang?  I'm just joking.  It could also be from all the cock that fucked you.  I hate 30 years.  She looks like she used to weigh 400 pounds and somehow lost it all.  In 20 minutes.  What happened to your pussy hair? 
[03:00:30]  She stayed in a...  It looks like Fred Mertz's head.  Fred Mertz's head.  No, I don't want to see a hemorrhoid.  Oh, my God.  Now, wait a minute.  I can see a hemorrhoid.  Yeah, there's a hemorrhoid.  Why would you not have that removed?  Show me the roid.  I didn't see it.  I don't believe you have one.  It's another general wart.  Show Jimmy the roid.  It's dangling down there pretty good.  Just open your asshole, please.  It's dangling.  It's like a cow udder.  It's really good.  Dude, your caratop's disgusted.  I have a great smelling ass. 
[03:01:00]  No, shut up.  Stop it.  It couldn't be any worse than your jokes.  Fucking show me your asshole.  Wait.  Hold on.  Should we have Pat Duffy smell her ass?  She says that again.  Oh, yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Bring in Pat Duffy.  Fucking Pat Duffy.  It's fucking Pat Duffy.  Fucking Pat Duffy.  Wow.  Turn that hat around.  You're going into battle.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  And his Amish beard.  That's right.  We'll go into battle here.  We want you to smell Sandy's asshole. 
[03:01:30]  Because we really think that's a general wart.  We don't want you to get like a wart on your nose.  Just sniff her asshole.  Get close.  Get a good sniff and let us know.  Steve, control this shit.  Open it up.  Open your ass cheeks, Sandy.  Spread them.  All right.  Get down there.  Pat Duffy will smell Sandy Kane's ass to see if it does indeed smell good.  Get in there.  Open it.  Get in.  All right.  Open your ass.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory.  Open your ass.  There you go.  All right.  Get in.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory this weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 
[03:02:00]  545-4242.  All right.  Pat, what's the matter?  I've had shit.  And that was worse.  Wow.  We might have found something that Pat can't handle.  One more whiff.  One more whiff.  One more whiff.  A good one.  One show Thursday.  Open it up, Sandy.  Open it.  Open up the ass.  Open it.  Open it.  Open up the ass.  Go ahead, Pat.  Get in there.  It's like pussy.  It's like an old attic.  Two shows Friday.  Two shows Saturday.  It's like an old attic.  He's cringing.  And that's from a man who brushed his teeth with dog shit. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  He had a puke in his face.  Yeah.  Wow.  You all right, Pat?  Yeah, I'm fine.  That was just...  Yeah.  It's like smelling salts.  If you pass out, just get Sandy.  Can you squat over your nose?  Can you smell her vag, too?  Just smell it.  All right.  Sure.  All right.  Good sport.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Let him smell your vag.  Open it up.  Open up that vag.  Carrot Top, can you believe you ever got shit for being a prop act?  Ever?  I was just going to say, ever?  I know.  Can you believe it?  I'm going to say, yeah.  Unbelievable.  And then sniff your finger.  No, Sandy.  No, no.  There's going to be no touching of your pussy. 
[03:03:00]  Sniff your finger.  Sandy, I swear I was going to say that.  Let him just smell it.  He's not going to touch it.  He's not touching your pussy.  Open the lips.  There's not a man in this room that's going to touch your pussy.  It's not that my pussy smells.  It's the G-string that smells.  It's like she lost 100 pounds in a day.  I can't believe she draws lines anywhere.  She doesn't.  Just spread your pussy and let Hal Roach fall out.  All right.  You don't have to.  Open the pussy. 
[03:03:30]  Pay as you exit.  Wait, wait, wait.  Steve, why are you miking her vag?  The vag doesn't talk.  I'm waiting until his face gets closer.  All of a sudden, he's miking her vag.  Steve the Bear blocking everything.  I'm loving him right now.  Yeah, you got a $50.  Put the Confederate money back in your fucking garter.  You got to pay her with a pelt.  Hallelujah, man.  Jesus, really.  I'm a Christian here, you know.  All right.  Steve.  One of the originals.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now you can. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  She's got to pull her pussy open.  Yeah, pull it open.  Hey, this.  Open it.  Open.  Pull it aside so you can get a good whiff.  Pull that aside.  Now get in there.  I'm not opening it.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait.  What does it smell like?  Once again with the attic musty never been.  Oh, it's fucking terrible.  Never been fucked.  Wow.  Nothing tells me.  It's awful.  Well, you know what?  I don't know.  Can you hear hits from the 60s in there? 
[03:04:30]  Hold on.  The wall of sound.  The wall of sound.  The wall of sound.  You just smelled Richard Pryor's 30-year-old cum.  Oh, shit.  Linger longer.  Oh, God.  You know what, Oak?  I'm not convinced that her asshole.  I think Pat's playing it up.  I think the only way to tell is for someone else to smell her asshole as well.  Step up to the plate, Norton.  And I think our own Iraq should just not touch it, but I think that Iraq should take a whiff. 
[03:05:00]  Iraq, what do you think?  I think so.  Yeah, Iraq, come on.  I think so.  You've been messing up lately.  This will get you back in our good grief.  Somebody's not thinking about Andy Williams right now.  I don't know why.  Make her open it.  Make her open the cheese.  Smelt his smell in a while.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, I know who that is.  Oh, I know who that is.  Turn around.  Look at Stan.  Stan's got the bucket.  Stan's got the bucket.  Pat fucking Duffy.  Pat fucking Duffy.  That was child's play.  Don't worry about it.  Child's play for Pat fucking Duffy.  Okay.  I have to go to confession.  All right, open the asshole.  Pull it down and open it.  Does she ever get tired of bombing? 
[03:05:30]  This is just for words.  I apologize, Carrot.  Sandy, open it.  Open up your asshole.  Yeah, pull that string aside.  Yeah.  Hold on to that.  Spread it open.  All right, we do have a bucket nearby because there's no way Iraq is surviving this.  There's no way.  I got five bucks so he'll tough it out.  You think?  Five bucks.  All right, you're on, man.  A good sniff.  Five bucks.  Hang in there, Iraq.  Okay.  He's going to pick.  Bend over more. 
[03:06:00]  Come on, hang in there.  I want to go buy a breakfast croissant.  Oh, he's done.  He's done.  Wait, that's only the first sniff.  You got it.  Oh, God.  Carrot Top, what are you here to promote again?  Try to get a plug-in.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God damn it.  All right, hold on. 
[03:06:30]  Carrot Top, two shows at the Luxor.  Hold on.  That's only the back end.  He still has to smell the front end.  Iraq, how was it?  Iraq, how was it?  Iraq, what was it smell like?  Like an open coffin.  That is horrible.  You got to smell the front.  Yeah, you got to smell the front, and then you're done.  Don't touch it.  Anthony, you sure you understand why Bill Moyers doesn't respect you as a journalist?  I can understand now.  Didn't Regis do this, too?  Come on, smell her cunt. 
[03:07:00]  I want you to get your nose in there, Gilman.  Get your nose in.  All right, here we go.  The front end.  Fatty Arbuckle.  He pulled a uterus out with a Coke bottle.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Front end for Iraq.  Here we go.  He said he didn't do it.  This is horrible.  Bigger prints.  We're all over a twat.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Iraq is getting ready.  A broken bottle. 
[03:07:30]  Hold that aside, Sandy.  You're cheating.  You're cheating.  Fatty Arbuckle.  Come on.  Charlie Chaplin was quite a ladies' man.  Okay, get in there.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Keep with Iraq, or I'll rip your hat off.  Go ahead, Iraq.  He got his mustache stuck on a wart.  All right, here we go.  Iraq.  Moving in.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  There he goes.  Wait, he's kind of gagging.  Come on, that was half a sniff.  All right.  That was not a good one.  Come on.  Be a fucking man.  First of all, strike.  Get in there.  Get in there. 
[03:08:00]  She grabbed the back of his head.  Come on.  Sandy.  Iraq, what happened?  Yeah, wait.  Something went wrong.  Wow.  Pull it from the other side, Sandy.  Don't eat out, I'll tell you that.  Sandy.  No.  Pull it from the other side.  Oh, zippity-doo-dah.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, you're doing that, Sandy.  This is it.  From that side.  Iraq, a good sniff, man.  Come on.  Come on, Iraq.  Do it for the troops.  Hold on.  Do it for the troops.  God, look at that thing.  She is dressed in the good.  Oh, God.  She did a USO gig in the Civil War. 
[03:08:30]  She's got this.  So, how are we doing, everybody?  With all my amputees.  The blue and the gray.  Iraq, now smell it with the lip.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  His face is a price.  Here we go.  He can't take Iraq.  Going in.  Come on, Iraq.  Give us a smell.  No touching.  Good sniff.  Big sniff.  You okay? 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, he's spitting his hand.  He's spitting his hand.  Iraq.  What, are you getting ready?  What's it smell like?  David Ortiz.  What's it smell like?  Embalming fluid.  You smell like someone died.  Oh, my God.  That is something.  When was the last time you've been laid?  Well, I could have gotten laid, but I said no.  Why?  Because I'm scared.  I'm scared. 
[03:09:30]  The guy will put his big dick in me, man, and then break my fucking heart.  Forget about it.  Break your heart, your neck.  Fuck him.  You know what I'm saying?  He was cute, too, but, you know, I have to, like, you know, I might fall apart.  He was cute?  He was very, and he's in radio, too.  Oh, Jesus.  He's a program director for radio.  Yeah, how you doing?  We're about the same age.  He was very drunk at the time.  How'd you meet Joe Franklin?  Joe Franklin comes dust.  I was going to go with Cousin Brucey by fitting people for the punch. 
[03:10:00]  Joe Franklin and I, we had sex in the bathroom at Joe Franklin's comedy club.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, very limp.  What year?  No shit.  He's fucking you.  I don't think it was Joe's fault.  It goes without saying.  Joe Franklin.  I couldn't give him a dick.  He's a tad.  And he smelled my pussy, too, and he was like, he liked it.  He's, you know, yes, he did.  This is what Sandy Cain's saying.  We don't know.  Jesus.  She's lying.  She's crazy.  She just lies.  It was back in 91 when I was funny.  That's when it happened.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And he had to duct tape a tongue depressor to his cock to fuck me. 
[03:10:30]  Sandy, what else you got today?  I don't think Joe Franklin ever fucked anyone, really.  Did you have a song you were going to sing?  Yeah.  Can I sing it?  What is that?  It's fuck around.  It's rock around Dolly Parton's twat.  All right.  You're just funny the way you word things.  What?  Unfortunately, you got to put headphones on that we're going to have to destroy after you're  Where is it?  You know, sucker for wordplay.  Can I do this topless?  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, please.  Don't do it like that.  No, topless.  I mean, without a head. 
[03:11:00]  Where's Tom Chiasano when you need him?  Exactly.  She has like four bras on.  Yeah.  She needs it.  Of course.  She's 80.  She needs it.  Tied into a sailor's knot.  Hold these titties out now.  Because they're real.  They're not implants, Coward Top.  They can't stay up with three bras on them.  This is for the new movie, Parton Medali.  What studio is doing this movie?  It's involved with the Rolling Stones' Apco.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Sure.  I hope it's a snuff film.  Fantasyland film presents.  Would you believe it's really...  Dolly Parton gets killed when she's 90.  That fucking rickety hat is really annoying me.  Rickety.  It's just dusty.  You know, you're not an American, man.  It's all about the USA.  Is it?  Yes.  Toby Keith's sister is here.  Yeah.  Go sing it.  Who's this guy?  Oh, he's Kenny.  This is my pasties.  They say Sandy Ken. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, good.  You got pasties on.  That's good.  Of course.  See, that'll keep everyone happy.  Oh, my God.  Pasties.  They're yarmulkes.  Holy shit.  Those things are huge.  No nipples, but...  Shriner's caps.  Definitely.  Shriner's caps.  Looks like her tits just graduated from Sloan Kettering.  Yeah, don't spin them around so much. 
[03:12:30]  They don't spin like the old days.  Hey, you want to bust in the mouth?  Oh, fuck.  You know, if you look just at the boobs, ignore the hideous faces.  Don't even start saying...  Don't even try.  For someone in, what?  You know what?  I got to go with Buffy.  Thank you.  That's pretty amazing for someone in their 70s.  Just the tits.  Just the rest of the body, you know.  He's 76, right?  You look good.  All right, here's your music, so you can sing your dumb song.  Here you go. 
[03:13:00]  You're going to sing a song.  Depart on me, Dolly.  Ready?  Where were you at?  World War I started.  World War I.  All right, shut up.  Shut up.  Right here.  This is World War I.  Shut up.  Here we go.  Ready?  Get ready to sing.  Here we go.  Focus.  Focus.  Dolly part wherever you are, bitch.  Feel free to sing along.  Take your big dick out and join me, hon. 
[03:13:30]  We're going to have some fun when your twat strikes one.  We're going to rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're going to rock around Dolly part in's twat tonight.  This is great.  When the clock strikes two, three, and four, she'll suck you dick.  You yell for more.  We're going to rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're going to rock around Dolly part in's fucking twat. 
[03:14:00]  You can't throw newspapers at her.  Finish your song.  No, I'm going to finish.  At least not in two sections.  That's the mental part.  Here we go.  Rolling up and hit her with it for shitting on the rug.  When it's 8, 9, 10, 11, 2, she'll suck you dick and then she'll screw.  Rock around Dolly's twat.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're going to rock around Dolly part in's fucking twat tonight.  She's really, like, selling it. 
[03:14:30]  When it's 8, 9, 10, 11, 2, she'll suck you dick and then she'll screw.  Rock.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, twat.  You're going to rock around Dolly.  Dump the garbage on top of her.  Oh, my God.  Everybody's saying that.  Dump the garbage pail all over her.  And the garbage is frankly laughing at me.  No, team.  He'll hear the music.  All right.  The music.  Oh, shit.  What other garbage is singing?  You had Sandy thrown under her. 
[03:15:00]  Hang on, there's another verse.  One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, twat.  It's five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, twat.  Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, twat.  We're going to rock around you, twat.  We're going to rock around Dolly Parton's fucking twat tonight.  There's merchandise available in the lobby.  Say, twat, twat, twat.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Undeterred through all of it.  Yeah, she kept going.  She's a trooper.  Thank you very much.  Dolly Parton.  Clean it up. 
[03:15:30]  Hey.  That is something.  Sandy, when was the last time you used a stripper pole?  Oh, we got one.  I know.  Yeah.  Do you want to do a little dance for us?  You have the music?  Yeah, can we play some music?  What kind of music do you like?  Well, I have the other Dolly Parton song, Here You Come Again.  No, we need a real stripper song.  Yeah, we need like a stripper song.  What was your song during the day?  Was it Benny Goodman?  I love it.  I love Dick. 
[03:16:00]  I should have put I love Dick with me.  I love Dick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on his dick.  Anything by Scott Joplin.  Just made a weapon.  Benny Goodman.  It's just like the piano player that used to play during the silent movies.  Here we go.  Yeah, here's your song from the old days.  Flash.  Get on the pole, you haw.  We bring you now to a strip club with Sandy Kane. 
[03:16:30]  Before we send the guys off to walk.  This is a celebration of the invasion in Normandy to free France from the Nazi menace.  And now we take a break with Sandy Kane.  Her vagina caused more damage than the Bombay of the Enola Gay.  This is what you're fighting for, boys.  Remember.  Remember.  We don't want Tojo getting his hands on this. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  This is what we're fighting for.  It kind of makes you want to go back to Iwo Jima.  What the fuck?  A pussy will remind you of the rice and raw fish we'll have to eat if the Japs win.  You thought being a POW was bad.  Hamagander at those.  She's rubbing her ass on the pole.  Don't rub your ass on the pole.  She's cooling off her hemorrhoid.  Scratching a hemorrhoid.  That's what it is.  It's a hemorrhoid scratch. 
[03:17:30]  It's refreshing.  She's scratching like a chihuahua on the carpet.  And her cunt looks like it's wearing the hat that got thrown into the Apocalypse Now helicopter.  Wow.  She's doing a little kick with her legs.  She's wearing big white go-go boots.  Yeah.  And genuine fishnet stockings.  It smells like the fish is still in them.  Can we get a mic on Sandy Kane?  Oh, you're putting a dollar under your breast?  That's good.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  She can put a safe under that. 
[03:18:00]  What move is that?  Was that ever popular?  No.  Jesus Christ.  That's the I don't want to break my hip move.  It's called my hips are like graham crackers.  Christopher Reeve wouldn't be jealous of that.  Oh, shit.  She's holding the pole and she was just like waving her right foot. 
[03:18:30]  I said dance on the pole, not dance like you have polio.  Dude, who does she look like?  It's driving me nuts from an old movie.  E.T.  She looks like D. Snyder.  Snyder.  The old Alec Baldwin movie.  It does.  With the ghost.  The ghost.  Oh, the one that.  Where she was like the secretary at the.  Help me out, somebody. 
[03:19:00]  I don't know the movie.  Yeah.  Beetlejuice.  Beetlejuice.  The receptionist woman.  Receptionist.  Thank you.  Got smoked out of her slit throat.  Yes.  Mic's not on.  All right.  We're turning into mic on.  Human heroes.  She does this shit.  Is this what you used to do in Times Square?  We can't hear her.  Yes, yes.  We can't hear her.  Yeah, that's what the dancer used to do in Times Square?  I used to get tips, though.  You get tips.  You don't come back.  Hopefully of bayonets. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, we can't hear you.  I had to do this for free.  She wants to be paid.  You want us for dancing on the pole?  What the hell do you want from us?  I've got ten bucks if you put some clothes on.  Hey, if you do the big finale by throwing your arms out and then just crashing through  both of those windows, I'll throw a fiver at your fucking cadaver.  New York.  Just plummets to her death. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  All right.  Get her back on mic.  There's going to be a scream.  Screw the stripper, Paul.  Who gives a shit?  Jesus Christ.  That is just something to look at.  Tarotop, where are you going to be, bro?  Wait for it in Vegas.  We're going to be hooking up later and doing some pole.  Hey, Tarotop, I'm going to be recovering.  I brought my matches if you want me to light my tits up for you.  Yeah?  You want to do that?  Yeah.  What are you promoting today?  Nothing.  Just a Luxor?  Yeah, back to Luxor.  You do it six times a week.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[03:20:30]  I forgot where my matches are.  I did have them.  Six nights.  Do you have any matches?  Have you ever seen anything like this in the lounges out there?  No, not really.  Not even at Circus Circus?  Okay, I want to do this just for Caratop.  I'm a big fan of yours.  I have watched you on TV, and you're nicer in person.  And Opian Ante the Greatest.  Oh, well.  Abuses.  And Jim.  And Jim Norton.  Okay.  This is to everybody here.  There's no blood left in her nipples.  There's no pigment left in her nipples.  Big titties, Caratop, but I don't have any nipples. 
[03:21:00]  God left me out.  But then again, he gave me Toronto.  Why are they so awfully nipples?  He took her nipples away and gave me Toronto.  They've been chewed off.  Phil Spector shot them off.  He was using them as target practice.  She's got innies that she can stay.  Oh, God, that is disgusting.  You can only imagine the cheese that is built up in there.  Oh, God. 
[03:21:30]  You could squeeze her tit like space food.  It'll just come out.  Toothpaste tube.  I'll tell you, men don't know how to make love to titties, guys.  I mean, really, they go right down to the pussy.  They like big titties, but they don't really know how to excite tits.  I'm having trouble.  Anyone goes right to the pussy.  You have a hell of a memory.  I'll tell you.  Don't light your frigging wig on fire.  Anybody having a birthday out there?  She looks like they got literally erased. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  The old burlesque music playing.  There she goes.  She's lighting her magic.  There it is.  I want to see her without the wig.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  There she goes.  Can you do this doused in gasoline?  You're going to set your wig on fire.  Yeah, you're going to set your hair on fire.  Put her out.  Put her out.  There you go.  Hopefully, it's a Michael electrocuter.  Oh, I like it. 
[03:22:30]  I love abuse.  You almost set your hair on fire.  I know.  Can we see you without the wig?  Is that flame retardant?  It's one of the biggest train wrecks I've seen coming into this show.  It's worth it, guys.  You know, don't be an Anthony.  Without the wig, I want to see you.  Where are you performing?  Oh, come on.  Let me see you without the wig.  So what?  I'm doing this movie.  No plug until I see you without the wig.  Yeah, you sold us your rectal abscess.  You can...  I don't care.  Isn't this...  What was the...  I have it.  Let me see it. 
[03:23:00]  Hey, Anthony, you know who she reminds me of?  The old cartoon where the dog pulls off the wig.  Dino was in love with...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when Dino was in love with that dog that did the commercial.  Yeah.  It was like a lassie.  And then Dino saw the dog without the makeup.  Yeah.  Went like...  Ooh.  She looks like Buffalo Bill when he was dancing.  Yeah.  Would you?  Hey, I'm going to be at Eastern Cock.  Eastern Cock is a gay club downtown.  Oh, yeah?  Eastern Cock, that's going to be October 3rd. 
[03:23:30]  How appropriate.  I can't imagine any man wanting to fuck a woman ever seeing you.  That's going to reinforce all of their ideology.  Maybe even if there's a few that are on the fence, they'll fall right on a cock after they  live.  If she could sell tickets, you'd have her at your club.  Are you open in October?  The Yankees are in the playoffs.  Eastern Cock.  Every cock is on a fucking plane to L.A. right now.  Hey, really fast.  We did find her stripper music.  Very good news.  Okay, great.  This is what Sandy Cain used to dance to.  What?  In 1912. 
[03:24:00]  I was the first one.  Here's her stripper music.  Okay.  There it is.  This is hilarious.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're sorry we couldn't get Mary Pickford.  But here is Sandy Cain.  But here is Mary Yuckford.  Instead, you got Mary Pickaxe.  A benefit for all those lost on the Titanic last week. 
[03:24:30]  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  Very good.  Is this what you would dance to?  Yeah.  I can dance to anything, man.  Anything.  Remember the Lusitania.  Did you work in one of those clubs where the little door would go off and there was the  glass?  Peep shows.  Peep shows?  Yes.  Yeah?  It was great.  I watched all men masturbate for like a long time.  And it was great because I really learned a lot about men.  Yeah?  That men will do it to anything, man. 
[03:25:00]  Sheet.  If they could do it to me, right?  And I worked there a long time, so.  I bet you've seen more cocks wilt.  I saw more cocks.  It looked like time-lapse of flowers.  And then, you know, there's this guy who gave me a lot of money to shit on my face.  Who is that, God? 
[03:25:30]  And why haven't you cleaned off your face yet?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  It paid the rent, you know?  I mean, really?  The job sunk, but you have to, you know, you have to do something in life, right?  Not everyone's as lucky as Carrot Top.  Yeah.  He feels lucky right now.  Yeah.  Hey, Carrot Top, are you going to be on the next Surreal Life? 
[03:26:00]  No.  Oh, all right.  I'm getting the wrong info, then.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't think so.  Oh, shit.  That's pisser.  Anything else, Sandy?  Sandy, yeah.  No, and I'm also, you know, I still have my public access show called Sandy Kane's Midnight Blue.  It's on every Friday night at 12 midnight on Channel 57 and 84 RCN.  And anyway, and I will be taping a live show at Eastern Cox. 
[03:26:30]  Can I shit on your face right now?  That'd be great.  I see Carrot Top shit on Sandy Kane's face.  I dare you.  That'd make you tube.  Yeah, we'll cross-promote both their shows.  Yeah.  I dare you.  I dare you.  I dare you.  You like that stuff?  I love it, man.  Now, real quick.  I want to talk about Phil Spector a little bit.  Okay.  Do you think he killed that actress?  He totally did.  She did not stick a gun into her.  Of course, man.  That's why I came out and said it, because he put a gun to my fucking head. 
[03:27:00]  And I said, anything you want, Phil.  I think she should have done whatever he wanted her to do.  And she didn't.  And he murdered her.  So that's what you think?  I know.  Because he made you suck his cock with a gun to your head.  Right.  As he sanded off your nipples.  Phil Spector made you suck his cock with a gun to your head?  Yeah.  In a limo or something.  Who had the gun to his?  I actually jumped in my pants to get that one out. 
[03:27:30]  He came running out of the bathroom with that one.  No, the thing is, in those days, I was the only one with tits.  Years ago, they didn't have implants.  So, you know, you say, I had still.  Would you grow up in a Filipinos boy youth home?  No, I'm just saying that, no, years ago.  She still has the burnt matches sticking out of her tits.  I know.  It's just awful.  Oh, my God.  No, but I'm just saying, I was pretty hot when I was 22 years old.  And I had big titties when nobody did. 
[03:28:00]  Were your nipples like that, though?  Always.  Honest to God, I might even make a pun of you.  I need someone.  Why don't you suck one out?  Your nipples look like assholes.  They look like two assholes.  Bleached assholes.  There are nipples inside.  If someone would suck them out, but no one wants to.  God really didn't want to finish making you.  No.  Even though I want to.  Hey, don't touch my nipple.  Even an infant would pass that.  That's a starving infant.  Unbelievable.  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't find my nipples. 
[03:28:30]  Suck on my nipple.  All right, hold on.  We got.  She's talking to Mitch Hedberg.  Yeah, we got Casper checking in.  Casper, what's up?  Five dates with Bill Spector, and she's still alive.  Very good.  Still alive, man.  Yeah.  He definitely killed her.  Do you think he's going to be convicted?  Hung jury is what they say.  He's still, he's really well hung, huh?  Excuse me.  All right.  Anything else there, Sandy Cade?  Yeah, but isn't, aren't they going further with the trial?  Yeah, they're figuring that out, what they're going to do. 
[03:29:00]  They got to do a redo.  The judge is leaning towards convicting him, though, right?  Don't you think?  The judge?  I think it's a jury system.  Yeah, as long as they can go to court in England.  What does Her Majesty's Court say?  No, but he's leaning, you know, because he really did murder the woman, she's not going  to kill herself, right?  I don't know.  You should.  Yeah.  Why couldn't?  Let's give Phil a second chance.  I love how Sarah, she's literally standing knee-deep in trash, topless, streamers hanging 
[03:29:30]  up.  I think the problem with the trial was...  She's disgusting, like it's court TV.  Yeah, to be honest about her.  I'm waiting for a house to hit her, and those shoes to curl up underneath.  Phil Spector was fucked up that night.  Oh, yeah?  He was on pills, he was on everything, he was incoherent, he was crazy.  He's a credible witness, she should bring her into the courthouse just like that.  Maybe she should give the testimony while she lights her nipples on fire. 
[03:30:00]  Let me tell you something about Phil.  Richard Pryor the same exact way.  He was totally incoherent, un-fucked-up on every shit there was.  There's no way Pryor fucked you.  Why not?  He was crazy about me.  No, he wasn't.  He never heard of you.  What do you mean he never heard of me?  How do you know?  Because I just know.  We read his autobiography, there's nothing in there about you.  Exactly.  Yeah, well, you know, he definitely did, and he was just very crazy about me. 
[03:30:30]  But he was totally fucked up at all times.  And that night he didn't have cocaine, so I was about to leave, and then he said,  Hey, leave the pussy, bitch.  If he knew you, chapter six of his autobiography would be,  The bitch had no nipples.  He went right down to the pussy.  He was not interested in titties.  He probably thought you fucked that thing on your pussy with an umbrella,  he wanted to sit under it.  He was a really crazy guy.  He was a really crazy guy.  But I would have fucked him if he had cocaine. 
[03:31:00]  He did not have cocaine.  Wait, he always had cocaine.  Not that much.  You have to have standards, and thank God you have standards.  Yeah, right.  He probably had it and didn't want to fuck you.  He priored him with me.  Yeah, exactly.  No, he definitely did.  You know, when you're 22, baby, you know, even you look good then.  You didn't know prior when you were 22?  I want to see pictures of her when she was in her 20s.  Yeah, but she didn't know prior.  Are there any pictures of you?  Do you have a website or something?  No, but...  Or just webs in your pussy?  No, I have pictures when I was four. 
[03:31:30]  In a covered wagon?  Isn't it true you were in front of a fire when he set himself on fire?  Yeah, that's the reason.  No, I really...  Really, really?  How old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  So can I.  Yeah, we heard that one before.  Well, that's mine.  Take your wig off.  Why would you, when they gave away the punchline, just do another one that's the same?  What kind of comedy instincts are those?  You know what?  I think Jim's asking you...  That's what annoys Jimmy.  Jim's asking a good question.  That's what annoys him. 
[03:32:00]  That's a good question.  Like, you just said, can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  And the punchline is, well, so can I.  And then they said, well, so can I.  And instead of just realizing the joke was blown, you went, well, that's mine.  Like, we're not going to recognize it was the same thing.  And go, ha ha, you card.  No, the thing is, well, that's mine.  That's a punchline.  That's yours.  But the punchline is, well, that's mine.  You're not listening to Jim.  He's asking a great question.  You have no listening skills.  Okay.  You're right.  You're right.  When you're right, you're right.  No.  What is she doing?  What is she doing?  That's an impression. 
[03:32:30]  When you're right, you're wrong.  You're doing impressions?  Yeah, I could do...  Swear it's the real person.  All right.  We're finally all calming down.  I could do...  Joan Rivers, can we talk?  Can we talk?  Can you do one with Edgar?  Oh, that's great.  That's great.  That's great.  This is...  I could do...  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Wow.  Who's that?  Oh, my God.  That's...  I love you, Mr....  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Who's that?  Wow, that's good.  Oh, that's dead on. 
[03:33:00]  Dead on.  Wow.  Dead on.  That's pretty good.  One more friend, Drescher.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Just does one line.  How about one more impression of her?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  Oh, my gosh.  It sounds...  Wow.  Do the episode where they got lost in the cabin.  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  You're a one-trick pig.  Oh, Jimmy.  One-trick horse fucker. 
[03:33:30]  That's it.  Can we talk?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield.  We get it.  We get it.  You think I'll get to Vegas?  You get that thing removed.  Maybe we can't even get to Jersey.  That's when you got it, right?  You said you got that thing?  You're on your way to Coney Island.  Oh, wait a second.  Get to Vegas.  I hope she gets to Vegas like Pesci in Casino.  Just beating in her underpants into a fucking hole by Frank Vincent.  Well, next time I'll come on, I'll wear my real hair, okay?  I want to see your hair. 
[03:34:00]  Don't be shy.  You just showed us your hair.  Fuck, man.  God Almighty, you're not going to show us your hair?  Let's see your hair.  Nah.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  How could you show a hemorrhoid and a general word and not show your hair?  No, come on.  Is it red?  Yeah, it's red.  It's like this.  Let me see it.  I don't.  Don't.  All right.  Jesus.  Sandy, I want to see it.  Oh, Christ.  All right, let's go.  Let's see the other thing.  I'm not taking my fucking wig off shit.  Unless you give me $100.  No, I'm not giving you $100.  We're going to plug your gig for you.  With all your money, Tim?  Five bucks.  You get five bucks.  I said before, don't touch the hair. 
[03:34:30]  We'll plug for you.  We'll plug.  Take over my hair.  We'll plug your gig.  Give me the hundred.  I can't pay my rent with your fucking clothes.  I'll suck your nipple out.  I bought your book.  I read your book.  Man, you're making fucking money, man.  Exactly.  I'm not seen.  So show me the way.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Read your book.  Show me the way.  Yeah.  Sounds like Harvey Keitel in Mean Streets.  Hey.  Hey.  Next time I can do the show, I'll show you my real hair, okay?  All right.  Oh, it's just no good.  You know, remember my hair?  It's down to here.  Down to my hemorrhoid. 
[03:35:00]  Hey, let's go to the Verrazano Bridge and jump off.  That would tap it.  Can I be your opening act?  Titties, the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't have to be titties.  It could just be asshole.  Carrot Top, can you follow that?  It may not, actually.  It's a prop act following a prop act.  All right.  Where's Dildo?  Where's Dildo?  Yeah, fine.  Gather up your stuff.  Put your stuff.  Yeah, take Dildo and get the fuck out of here. 
[03:35:30]  Here's her music.  Leave your hemorrhoid.  Here's your camera.  Could someone...  Oh, what disease do I have now that I held this?  Probably roaches crawled all over.  Oh.  Yeah, your apartment has a lot of roaches, right?  Oh, totally.  Yeah, running away from her.  Now I have water bugs, so I'm really, you know...  You really?  Wow.  Of course.  Well, you know, roaches are big water bugs.  Yeah, no.  I mean, water bugs are big.  Yeah.  You have water bugs?  Oh, definitely.  Where are they?  I love them.  Next time I'll...  Not in her twat.  I'll eat one.  We did a Cribs, right?  We did a Sandy Cane Cribs.  We went over our house and videotaped our house. 
[03:36:00]  Man, you got to see this place.  Roaches?  Holy shit.  Yeah, it was really a little run down.  And what about you?  You had a small little room when they did that with you, right?  With you.  And now you have a big place right in Hell's Kitchen, right?  Yeah.  Well, and you still live in that shithole.  That's terrible.  I live in Hell's Kitchen.  Do you?  She lives a block away from me.  She's still a block away from me.  Yeah.  She's the reason they call it Hell's Kitchen.  Hell's Kitchen.  You're cooking in Hell's Kitchen.  Hell's bathroom.  All right. 
[03:36:30]  Thank you, Sandy Cane.  Yeah, thank you.  We're exhausted.  Thank you, guys.  All right, thank you.  Until next time.  No problem.  Yeah, gather up your stuff.  Okay.  And thank you.  The garbage too?  Well, you can do that for an intern or something.  Okay.  I'm sure they'll be happy to clean it up.  They smell pussy.  They got to clean it up.  Yeah.  All right.  I want Sandy to put on a shirt.  I want Sandy to put on a...  Hold on, Sandy, please.  I want Sandy to put on her bra and hat and run through the K-Rock halls.  I want her to run into Chiasano's office.  Is he still here?  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  I put your...  Still here.  Life back together.  Take a little longer.  Well, Carrot Top, I hope you were pleased with your appearance here.  Yeah, we have to catch a flight, Sandy.  Yeah, you and Sandy.  So we got Carrot Top, Luxor, and Las Vegas.  Yeah, Luxor starting again.  We got a lot of fans out that way.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Six times a week.  In fact, I got a lot of friends of mine that listen.  Oh, cool.  I knew I was going to be on.  Hey, is that the casino you've always been playing at out there?  MGM.  MGM for about 10 years, and then this one just started. 
[03:37:30]  Carrot Top.com.  Yes, sir.  All right.  By the way, can I...  Eric, can you put that monitor on that you wrote before, please?  I just want to point something out.  If it's still on, don't touch what you wrote.  Okay.  He wrote Carrot Top is here, and he spelled carrot with one R.  Of course.  If it was Cupcake Top.  Do you fucking believe that Bob's big boy hairdo?  Mayonnaise Top.  He doesn't know what a carrot is.  Leave Herak alone.  He smelled asshole today. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, I know.  Leave Herak alone.  He smelled a lot of it.  He smelled a lot of it today.  A real trooper today.  He's well in her 70s, and he smelled her anus.  She's just gathering her things in the background.  I apologize.  I'll leave Herak in that fucking ducky boy hairdo.  Ducky boy.  That fucking end of the wanderer's feisty hairdo.  Okay, Mr. Shop.  Anthony, turn around.  Turn.  Ah!  What about...  Yeah, go around that way. 
[03:38:30]  Take your pictures.  He likes taking pictures.  Yeah, well, things are going to fall.  Take one of Carrot Top.  That's a bitch.  All right.  Bill Burr is going to be at the Stress Factory all weekend long.  Starting tonight, Vinny?  Yeah, starting tonight.  Shows are busy.  Reserve it.  Me, you too.  Don't miss Bill.  Yeah, Bill pretty much sells out every time he's at the Stress Factory.  Thanks to this show, by the way.  Really?  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  Go over there, because I want to take a...  Go over there.  Look at Sandy.  She's dragging the Paltalk camera.  Come back.  Absolutely. 
[03:39:00]  She's a fucking disaster.  What happened?  She knocked the Paltalk camera over, and then she's dragging the other one.  She's dragging it on her foot.  I think the garbage is just attracted to her.  It's following her out of the studio.  Look at the cable for the Paltalk.  She's dragging it.  That was great.  She's just walking, dragging it.  She's walking out of the bathroom at Radio Shack.  You're a mess.  All right, listen.  Why don't we get the fuck out of here? 
[03:39:30]  Carrot Top, it was a pleasure meeting...  Well, hanging with you for the first time.  Oh, absolutely, man.  We would love to have you back.  We didn't do one of the...  Yeah, when you're back in New York, feel free.  Awesome.  That's fun.  Line of the day, I think Anthony had about 15 of them.  Yeah.  Fuck.  There's no way we could pick one or two, so just to acknowledge we do line of the day,  and it's brought to you by BodogFantasy.net, offering you all the tools you need to win  this season in fantasy football.  Trash talk with confidence and take home the glory.  Go to BodogFantasy.net, okay?  Do that.  Do that, please. 
[03:40:00]  We got to thank Bill Burr.  Yes.  And we got to thank Sandy, and of course, Carrot Top, and Vinny.  Of course, Vinny.  And Vinny Brand.  Yeah, everyone got their plugs in, so we're just out now.  Let's take it.  And I think Bill Burr's going to come back tomorrow, because we don't get to see him anymore,  because he's an L.A. boy.  Yeah, Bill.  Absolutely.  So, Bill, you just come back tomorrow.  Yeah, and get into the hole, I'm going to buy a hybrid.  I want you to yell at me.  I want to hear about your hybrid car and everything.  We got to do a little catch-up.  We haven't seen it in a while.  As I get into my Escalade and drive home.  People are voting for Line of the Day on Pal Talk.  They like the God shit on her face thing. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, that was great.  They like your time-lapse flower thing.  That was good.  Yeah, there were a lot of them.  I like the Dallas Cowboy.  You're opening the Ark of the Covenant.  And whatever you said coming out of the bathroom, Jesus Christ, there were so many of them.  There were so many.  Listen to the replay later.  I can't wait to hear the replay.  Pick your own.  What a day.  Oh, God.  I turned around.  All right.  Your ass is awful.  All right.  But you've got to admit, for a 93-year-old, she's kind of hot.  I don't know what it should look like, so I can't base it on anything. 
[03:41:00]  I bet.  If you just look at the...  Well, the boobs have a problem now, too, because there's no nips.  Right after the Triangle of Shirtwaist fire, I think she was at her hottest.  Wow.  Hey, by the way, I'm hearing Sandy Kane has videos on YouTube for the people that want to know more about this mess.  I enjoyed the Sands It Offer nipples.  Yeah, that's a great, funny one.  Oh, shut up.  Just leave.  God.  All right.  Treat our guests nice here, don't we? 
[03:41:30]  All right.  We're out of here.  All right, Sandy.  Thank you, Sandy.  Oh, God.  Go back to that failing rodeo.  They bring her out when they need the bulls to leave the arena.  Hey, this is Carrot.  Fuck.  Hey, it's Carrot Topper.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Fuck.  Turn it down.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  And this is the worst of Patrice O'Neill on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:42:00]  And now we have to take this time to kind of make fun of Patrice for a second, Anthony.  How do you make fun of Patrice?  In the privacy of my own home or a car with the doors locked, windows up.  It's easy.  How do you make fun of Patrice when he doesn't allow you to talk?  Come on, I'll let you talk.  Stop.  Enough with the high-pitched talking and the laugh.  We get it.  You're black.  Hey, E-Rock, this was a great idea.  Why don't you just play the fucking thing?  Obviously, we can't improv. 
[03:42:30]  Jesus.  And I can't even say improv.  Jesus, will you get me the fuck out of this bit?  Thank you.  We'll be right back. 
[03:43:00]  Rickleson, his latest movie is getting, what, 18 stars?  Oh, I can't wait to see that.  Everyone is saying this is good.  What is it called?  Departed?  Departed.  Do you go to Rotten Tomatoes?  I thought Rotten Tomatoes was for bad movies.  No, Rotten Tomatoes basically is the...  Brother Wee's turned me on to this.  It's the greatest movie review site ever.  Because they take all the reviews from all the major papers in America.  And then they give you a nice average of what the movie's going to do. 
[03:43:30]  Right.  Because, you know, your local paper, you know, you might have one of these movie reviewers  that's too cool for the room, so you can't really feel...  Artsy, fartsy guy.  So you don't know where his head's...  Yeah.  You don't know where his head's at.  He's giving, you know, movies one star that deserve three or four.  Right.  So with Rotten Tomatoes, they take all the reviews, and then they give you one solid rating.  Yeah.  And Departed, for example, has a 94% positive...  94?  94% positive review on Rotten Tomatoes. 
[03:44:00]  That's huge, right?  That's massive.  That means, like, one guy didn't like the movie in America.  But it means, yeah, it means somebody or a couple of reviewers didn't like it.  How are these guys?  Nicholson, the same old, same old...  Yeah, I don't really agree with...  They gotta be one of these idiots that just, I can't go along with the crowd.  I can't.  Maybe the guy on, during his regular job, he, like, reviews kiddie porn, and there wasn't  enough, uh...  Not enough kiddie porn in there.  Not enough kiddie porn in this movie for him, so he had to give it a bad review. 
[03:44:30]  I used to...  I used to be on...  This one guy I used to be on, like, old white guy, because I was on this thing where  I wanted all old white actors to disappear and move away.  And I was really...  You know who I feel sorry for now, and I want him to make a comeback, is that damn Kevin  Costner.  Oh, yeah.  And The Guardian got such a disgusting review, and it's just like, I really feel bad for him,  because it's like...  That was his big comeback movie.  He really is the Brett Favre of acting.  He...  But in the 80s and early 90s, that guy was making these epic movies that a lot of people 
[03:45:00]  would, like, say, oh, it's too long and everything, but any time they're on, I'm watching  it.  I love that Postman.  I love Waterworld.  I love...  Yeah.  The Postman.  The Postman was a great movie.  Silverado was the greatest Western...  It's the best Western I've ever seen, Silverado, and then the one with Clint Eastwood, but I  know you...  The Good, the Bad, the Ugly?  And the Ugly?  No, none of his...  None of the spaghetti ones.  The one with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman.  Unforg...  Oh, The Unforgiven. 
[03:45:30]  Unforgiven.  Or Unforgiven, whatever.  Yeah, that was a great movie.  It was great, but I loved The Postman.  Yeah.  All those...  Wait a minute, you just called me out saying I don't like Clint Eastwood?  I didn't like his...  That fight movie.  I thought you didn't like him now as a...  I hate Clint Eastwood now.  All right, then what's the matter about me?  Unforgiven is pretty old now, bro.  It's about...  That's at least 10 years old.  At least.  99, right?  That's when he was still...  No way.  That's when you could still put him in the Western attire and he didn't look ridiculous.  Yeah, no.  It changed for me when he's soaping up in Bridges of Madison County. 
[03:46:00]  Oh.  Yeah, I got dragged to that.  Oh, that goddamn chick flick, Bridges of Madison County.  I got dragged to that piece of crap.  Yes.  When he's out by the well and he's got his shirt off and he's washing himself and what's  her name there is...  Meryl Streep is in the window watching him and slowly touching her shoulders and running  her hands down her body, getting all hot.  And he's just a mess.  He's all...  He's like an old leather purse. 
[03:46:30]  Old man.  He had his baloney boobs.  What she was doing...  What she was doing...  She wasn't getting off on him.  She was touching her shoulders.  She was touching herself.  I feel the same way he looks.  Like, oh, I got the heebie-jeebies looking at him.  I feel leathery.  Are you ready to feel old?  Unforgiven?  1992.  Oh, okay.  Is that 92?  That's an old movie now.  That's an old movie.  Is that the city old?  Yeah.  Yeah, because someone born then is how old?  A teenager right now.  14 years old. 
[03:47:00]  But no, Unforgiven I consider new.  And let's get real.  Unforgiven was an amazing Clint Eastwood movie, right?  After that, it was in the line of fire.  Great movie.  Which was a good movie.  Great movie, man.  A Perfect World.  Bridges of Madison County.  I liked A Perfect World.  That was good.  Which one was that?  And that was Costner.  That was Kevin Costner with the little kid.  That was a Clint Eastwood movie?  He kidnaps the little kid or...  That was a Clint Eastwood movie.  Yeah.  Clint Eastwood was a...  You can't...  That was...  I'll give you that.  That was a good movie.  All right.  That's amazing, man.  And then you go Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys. 
[03:47:30]  That was awful.  Blood Work.  And then that freaking fight movie that everyone loved.  I couldn't stand Million Dollar Baby.  It made me...  It was the most unnecessary...  You shouldn't be that sad at a movie.  How much more depressing.  Unless they do a movie of someone who actually...  But even if it's real, it's like, you know what?  At least when she dies, put her in a robot chair or something.  But it's like for half the movie, I watched her deteriorate into the bedpan stuff. 
[03:48:00]  It was like, why do I have to watch this?  Why?  Why?  When is this going to turn for me?  No.  Then he leaves.  Here's what I hate.  I don't like when a character leaves a movie, and at the end of the movie, it doesn't go...  It doesn't tell you what happened to the character.  Just a little line.  What do you want?  The freaking Animal House ending?  Yes!  I want Animal...  I want that ending for every movie.  Bluto married him.  All right, Bluto.  All right, baby.  Here comes Senator Blutarski.  That's what you want, the Animal House ending.  Oh, man, he went crazy in Vietnam.  The Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
[03:48:30]  Jeff Spicoli spent the reward-wanted money hiring Van Halen to play at his birthday party.  Is that all, Jeff did?  Damn!  Don't they do?  Because Hollywood has to do their...  Hollywood has to do their thing and be too cool, you know?  How about this?  Every movie has the Fast Times at Ridgemont High ending.  After the credits.  Most people are out of the theater.  You like Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  If you want to...  I like it.  Oh, yeah.  I loved it.  If you want that type of ending, you just sit through the credits and wait so you could  be taken care of.  I always thought it was a little silly on a drama. 
[03:49:00]  Like comedies, it's one thing.  But in a drama, it's kind of silly to put that ending, what happens to the characters,  because it's fictional.  You know what happens?  They turn back into the actors.  They went to their wonderful homes and had wonderful meals.  No, man.  No.  You got it.  Please give me Blutarski.  Senator Blutarski.  You want Senator Blutarski taking off with the hot chick in the car?  Oh, man.  That's the...  Oh, that jerk.  Because he beat him up early in the movie.  That jerk.  Good.  He died in Vietnam.  And T-Day, they don't even know where he is. 
[03:49:30]  Good.  She got pregnant.  Good.  We're about to unknown.  She had a water head.  All right.  Yeah.  Because I didn't like her in the movie.  Oh, the virgin guy got to go out with the other...  You know what?  That's good.  He deserved it.  Spider bifida?  Damn.  I was really liking her.  Yeah, every movie.  Yeah, every movie.  Yeah, every movie.  After he splashed that man in the face with the hot coffee, what happened to Judge?  What?  What?  He lost a toe in a lawnmower accident. 
[03:50:00]  Just get stupid.  I love...  You got to have that, man.  I need that.  And that damn...  That million dollar baby, dude.  It...  Yeah, very depressing.  It just should have had a Rocky thing to it.  To me...  But that's what it...  That's where...  When you said the chick thing...  The feel-bad movie.  The Madison County thing, it's like, you know women love that.  There's something about that that women love.  But guys want to see her knock out the girl that broke her neck.  She comes back. 
[03:50:30]  She drinks raw eggs.  She beats up a few girls.  Right.  On the way to getting back the one that broke her neck.  And then it's the old Rocky Clubber Lang thing.  Yeah.  Where, you know, he goes in there and just kicks some ass.  Get the music going and get that montage going.  When she lost her leg...  I want to see your montage.  I want to.  I said...  When I was watching this, right?  I got sucked into it.  And I said, when she lost her leg from infection...  Yeah.  I go, wow.  How's she going to...  How's she going to come back?  How's she going to come back and not figure out what I'm going to do?  This story's getting good because somehow they got to figure out a way to give her a leg 
[03:51:00]  and get her in the ring again.  Man, this movie's been on for three hours.  She going to get a prostate leg in the fourth hour?  Ah, nope.  Oh, no.  And then when did you start thinking?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I don't think...  Oh, this isn't going to end well.  This isn't going to end well.  What?  What?  Did the parents get the money?  That's the only thing.  I think the parents didn't get the money.  If the parents got the money, I'd have sued Clint Eastwood. 
[03:51:30]  Emotional.  I'm not supposed to go to the movies for that.  That's something you're supposed to hear somebody tell you on the phone and you go...  I'm sorry to tell you this.  Um, um...  Yeah.  Look, I got to go, man.  All right.  Oh, fuck.  And then Clint Eastwood is working on Dirty Harry, 2007.  Oh, no.  And he's playing Dirty Harry or not?  No, stop it.  Is he mentoring?  He cannot play...  Don't do this.  It's in pre-production.  Who's the star in it?  Because I'm going to tell you what it's going to be.  It's going to be him as the mentor to some new Dirty Harry. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, new Dirty Harry.  Vin Diesel's Dirty Harry.  Look, you'd remind me a lot of me when I was your age.  A lot of that.  Look, it's a different time and a different age.  Is it?  And it's going to be like...  Yeah, pops.  I get it.  All right, old man.  This is how we do it today in some Fast and the Furious car.  Hey.  Hey, slow down.  I'm getting too old for this.  Yeah, we know.  Remember Colors?  It's like, hey, the cow...  Pac-Man.  Pac-Man.  Dude.  Yo, Pac-Man. 
[03:52:30]  I just happened to have this in front of me today.  Clint Eastwood's greatest movie ever.  Which one?  Play Misty for me.  Play Misty for me.  This was horrible.  This was a TV movie from the 70s where he plays a disc jockey in this old...  I guess it was a lighthouse or something.  They had turned into a...  This was a TV film?  TV movie.  A lot of big celebrities did TV movies back in the old days.  A lot of them were good, too.  Simple was a TV movie.  It was like, remember, yeah, remember, the ABC Sunday night movie starring... 
[03:53:00]  And it was like a big event.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  They don't do that now.  And Brian Dennehy was the number one guy on the CAS list.  Yeah.  Brian Dennehy.  Joyce DeWitt.  And...  You Stole My Child.  Tragedy.  In a Lifetime Exclusive starring Markie Post.  And the mother from Family Ties.  The mother from...  And Joe from The Facts of Life. 
[03:53:30]  From The Facts of Life.  After losing her breast to breast cancer, she thinks she found the perfect man.  But he turns into a nightmare.  Yeah, it was...  So he's like...  Starring Barbara Streisand's husband.  So he's the perfect guy until halfway through the movie where he's like, just out of nowhere,  tells her, shut up!  And smacks her in the face.  He goes, oh!  I didn't know he was abusive.  And then he just turns into some homicidal maniac.  And she's got to kill him. 
[03:54:00]  And then it ends in the courtroom with her getting acquitted.  Yeah.  Farrah Fawcett was good for that.  That was the first one, the burning bed.  Burning bed.  Where she burnt the husband up in the bed.  In the bed.  That was like a true story or something.  She's announcing that she has cancer today, by the way.  Yes.  She wants everyone to...  She held a press conference to tell the press to leave her alone.  Yeah, she had a press conference to tell the press to leave her alone through this difficult time.  I think she's got the poop cancer.  No.  Does she?  The colon?  I'm not sure.  Ow.  What kind of cancer is Farrah fighting? 
[03:54:30]  Poopy cancer?  Oh, my...  Jesus.  Did she got the poopy cancer?  It's not.  Come on, man.  I love your medical jargon there.  Look at me, man.  Don't you...  Don't betray somebody that you know you've pleasured yourself to when she was young and  hot, man.  That poster?  Come on, man.  That everyone had on the wall?  I liked her...  Even Tony Manero had that poster on his wall.  Come on, man.  Don't...  Nah, I liked her replacement, actually.  Cheryl Ladd?  Cheryl Ladd was...  Yeah, back in the day, man. 
[03:55:00]  Cheryl Ladd, in the Charlie's Angels days, was unbelievable.  Yeah.  They killed us.  But then they got that Terry Hatch?  Hatcher?  What was...  No, no, the other one.  Not Terry Hatcher.  No, not Terry Hatcher.  It was something Hatch.  Some other blonde bimbo.  Like, I'm supposed to remember that goddamn name.  It's been 30 years.  Starring the mother from Growing Pants.  You guys want to hear...  You guys want to hear Clint Eastwood as it?  It was a love she thought would last forever. 
[03:55:30]  Little did she know he held a secret.  There was a sinister side to Alan Thicke.  Oh, anytime it's anything with a penis, it's bad in a Lifetime movie.  Alan Thicke.  Alan Thicke.  You guys want to hear Clint Eastwood as a DJ?  Yeah, let's do this.  This is Play Misty for me.  TV movie back in the 70s when they were really big.  I can't...  Are you sure this is a TV movie?  Absolutely.  Someone was saying that it was in the movie theater.  No, it wasn't.  I think it was in the movie theater.  I'm telling you.  I will bet any amount of money right now. 
[03:56:00]  Play Misty for me.  TV movie.  Stop it.  Go to IMDB and we will...  Internet movie database.  Solve this.  If this bill hangs up, I'll hunt him down.  All right.  Hold on, Bill.  We'll find out.  Hold on, Bill.  Well, the movie is Clint Eastwood.  He's a DJ in Carmel, I guess.  Yeah, Carmel.  A little radio station in the middle of nowhere, and he had to write his poems for his radio show.  His radio show.  Got to feel the music.  He had to pick out his music, and then he had to play poems that he wanted to play in between  tunes.  That's what it was. 
[03:56:30]  And then he had to listen to that drivel.  And then he had the stalker that all she wanted to hear was play Misty.  Yeah, play Misty for me.  Play Misty for me.  And it just ends up with her running into the studio or his house with a knife trying  to kill him.  Oh, yeah.  And all she'd say was, play Misty for me.  And at first it was like, all right, what's your name?  All right, here's Clint Eastwood on the radio.  Taking requests.  Here he is.  Two for Tuesday.  You're in the lighthouse.  Here he is reciting one of his poems. 
[03:57:00]  Poems.  Men have destroyed the roads of wonder, and their cities squat like black toads.  This sucks.  In the orchards of life, nothing is clean or real or as a girl.  That's the PD.  Make it to love or be a man with.  This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk, and five hours of music to be  very, very nice to each other.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Clint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, we're going to talk.  Can you bring in an air check into my office?  So you really got to go over this. 
[03:57:30]  You stink as a jock.  Yeah, but he ends up throwing her off the cliff in the end of the movie.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  But he's the worst disc jocky ever.  Hey, Opie, the Dirty Harry thing you're looking at on IMDb is the video game Clint Eastwood  is going to be in.  Oh, he's doing a voiceover for it?  I thought it was in the movie section.  Oh, okay.  It's IMDb.  I'm sorry about that.  Oh, it's a video game.  Okay.  Oh, that's cool.  Usually you'll just see a VO for voiceover.  Here's the broad calling in to Clint Eastwood as he does his radio show.  Men have destroyed the roads of wonder.  That sounds like my poem again. 
[03:58:00]  I'm being redundant.  Sorry.  It's a twofer, I told you.  Caramel, Dave Garver speaking.  Hello?  Hi, what'll it be?  Play Misty for me.  Misty, huh?  We have that right on the player rack.  Thanks for calling.  That's his request.  Opie, push your fart button for me.  Yeah.  Do the thing when a guy's choking and doing something.  See, this is what DJs did before Howard showed us all what to do. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, thank God.  You dick.  Yeah.  A lot more sounds.  I invented poetry.  Hoo, hoo.  Hoo, hoo.  I'm going out to the Hamptons.  Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  They're ripping me off.  Men are ruining the world.  And black toads are coming.  But I invented all that.  Radio is nothing before me.  I'm going to satellite.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Radio is all about just reading poems. 
[03:59:00]  And five million listeners.  Before I came along.  Robin.  Robin.  Now I have to have my girlfriend fall down at Madison Square Garden.  So they talk about me in the paper.  Hoo, hoo.  Oh, what'd you do?  What was the last hoo you did?  Hoo, hoo.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Here's more Clint Eastwood on the radio.  We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute.  First, at ten minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Center, home of the Buccaneer, The Man's Boutique. 
[03:59:30]  The Man's Boutique is doing commercial reads.  Cheryl Teagues was replaced by Shelly Hack.  Shelly Hack.  Thank you, Ken.  I walked out.  She was horrid.  Thank you, Ken.  And here's one more Clint Eastwood thing on the radio.  And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night.  It's the great Errol Garner classic, Misty.  And this one is especially for Evelyn. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, boy.  He acknowledges Evelyn.  You want to hear Evelyn?  You want to hear Evelyn?  Even though Clint Eastwood was just reading poems on the radio, he was making enough money to have a maid.  And this is what Evelyn did to the black maid.  Please, somebody help me!  Of course they couldn't swear, but they could kill a black woman to death. 
[04:00:30]  Wow.  For a while.  They could stab a black woman until she really died.  I need a Negro woman for my movie.  All right.  Cut.  You're not screaming hard enough, Negro.  Yeah, he directed this movie.  Let's see.  I don't think they should have at least two directors when black people are in movies. 
[04:01:00]  It was his first directorial.  It was his first movie he directed.  Finished shooting four days ahead of schedule and $50,000 under budget.  Oh, look at that.  Film completed in 21 days.  Uh, I don't know.  It says nothing about the movies, but if it was in the movie, what is this?  In theaters in 71?  Made $10,600,000?  Like, up till when?  Yesterday at Blockbuster? 
[04:01:30]  I don't believe it.  Still not agreeing.  And cut.  Patrice, we need you to scream better than that.  Can she say, mammy?  Don't stab me, mammy.  And stop blinking.  We need your eyes buggy.  I'm new at this directing stuff, and it's throwing the lighting off.  Every time you open those big Negro eyes.  Listen, I'm not going to blame anybody, but the nigglet. 
[04:02:00]  Won't stop screaming correctly.  How can white people direct?  How can Steven Spielberg direct so many slave movies?  I don't know.  They seem to like it.  Lordy Jesus, cut.  Look, let me talk to you.  I've directed Jaws, Duel.  I've done a lot of things.  I know the way Negro's supposed to scream.  Now, you go lordy, lordy.  Because that's what they said back then.  I did the research.  W-D-E-E-L-O-O-D-U-I. 
[04:02:30]  Black people.  Lordy, lordy.  Black people have no problem with Spielberg making black movies.  But Spike Lee's got problems with white people making certain, like, black theme movies.  Like, some.  Why should you?  Wait a minute.  Because Spike Lee had made Schindler's List.  Because Schindler's List had been a Spike Lee joint.  I think he could have.  But I think it would have been completely different.  Different take on it.  Different feel.  Oh, Hitler.  You better not put me in there.  But let me tell you something. 
[04:03:00]  Neither Steven Spielberg nor Spike Lee were either slaves or in the Holocaust.  So I don't got it.  So, but who should, okay, who's more qualified to make a movie about Italian family life, me or you?  All right.  But I'm in an Italian family.  But these guys were never in the Holocaust.  You could do as much research about the Holocaust, and I don't care what color you are, you're going to be able to make a film about it based on what you research.  Well, black people innately know what black people did because it's passed through, like, certain behaviors passed through black folks. 
[04:03:30]  You think it's in the genetic, in your genes?  Not genetic, but when you was a slave, somebody else, when the last slave was not a slave no more, he was still slavy enough to talk to the dude that's not a slave.  The next guy.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Spike Lee is more slavy because the Jews were slaves, too.  So Spielberg's not as slave-y, even though.  We can't start this now. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, we got to go to break.  Cecil B. DeMille knew that you, Brenna, knew what an Egyptian was.  We have to take a break.  This is good for after the break.  Because this is another 40 minutes.  Slave-y enough.  They're going to kill us down the hall.  It's the RNA virus spreading across America.  We got Patrice O'Neal in studio today.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal, and to find out any dates, any information, anything you need to know about me,  go to PatriceO'Neal.com, or visit me at MySpace slash Tourist in Brazil. 
[04:04:30]  I don't know why I did that.  I'm not that corny.  Somebody had stole my original MySpace, and that's what he put.  Like, because that's how he's, you know, he knew me from Brazil.  But that's my shit.  You can't even change it now.  Because by the time I got it, it was already 8,000 friends.  This nigga had more friends than I got now.  Like, I haven't even doubled the friends that this fucking imposter did.  So if you go to MySpace.com slash Tourist in Brazil, you can get some information on Patrice O'Neal.  And if you go to PatriceO'Neal.com, it'll tell you all the lovely little places I'll be. 
[04:05:00]  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the best.  Boo!  The best of the worst of the comedians of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  Holy mother of God.  Now presenting comedian...  Richard Jennings.  Richard Jennings out there? 
[04:05:30]  Yep.  Yeah, get him on the phone.  Richard Jennings is a comedian.  Called up yesterday.  Yes, he did.  At the end of the show, wanted to come in.  Mm-hmm.  Plug his show, Caroline's.  And for some reason, he kept getting disconnected.  Right.  And we invited him to come in today.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Who's this?  Richard Jennings.  Who's this?  Richard Jennings.  Hey, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[04:06:00]  How are you?  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy, thanks.  When are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time?  Probably about 4.40.  4.40?  It's what, 4.22?  Yeah, I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys. 
[04:06:30]  Hmm.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's penis, I could maybe stop  in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  You get along with him?  Yeah, you said yesterday, right?  Yes.  I've met him before.  In fact, I used to do jokes about him in my head.  Oh, you did?  I used to do a joke about big, hairy, fat guys with hair on their back getting all kinds  of chicks, and he came up to me.  I did the porno awards.  That's how I met him.  Oh, really?  I had a bit in there about fat, hairy guys getting all kinds of women. 
[04:07:00]  He comes up to me, he goes, you're talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, no.  It's just the generic fat, porno, hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the form.  It was just telling a story.  Oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio.  Right.  And you talk that way. 
[04:07:30]  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  Why can't I just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny.  That thing yesterday was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It'd be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does. 
[04:08:00]  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  It was so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show  because we're juvenile.  That's true.  You know?  Well, it's up to you.  I'm just hoping you put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny. 
[04:08:30]  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here.  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Clinton.  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  Do you got any knock-knock jokes? 
[04:09:00]  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Uh-oh.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol-whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it, Richard Jenny Ho?  Sorry. 
[04:09:30]  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Both of you are just the worst host ever.  All right, hold on, Richard.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Paul.  What's up, boys?  You're on the air with Richard Jenny,  who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Yeah.  Do yourselves a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday, 
[04:10:00]  and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead.  Oh.  Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did.  But actually, I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too.  Oh, he was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul.  Well, thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenny came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby.  Not for much longer.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean? 
[04:10:30]  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff.  Come on.  You're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right.  You're not having fun with this?  Yeah, it's funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny.  And then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet.  I have a long wait. 
[04:11:00]  Richard, do you know what our show's about?  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the O.P. and Anthony show, Richard?  Nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No.  Are you from New York or where are you from?  Originally from New York, yeah.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like Commonplace and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had. 
[04:11:30]  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah.  Oh, man, really?  Yeah.  Why?  What, you thought this wasn't on the air?  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm hanging up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Go see how that went.  He's right outside the door.  What's the matter? 
[04:12:00]  I thought we were having fun.  Why is everyone coming in here?  Go smooth things over.  No, we're going to go to the listeners and see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny.  Come here.  Sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny.  How are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh.  He looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You'd spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right? 
[04:12:30]  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny after we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  Just let's see how much we can screw with Richard.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on speaking of the beach.  All right.  Forget it.  Opie.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies. 
[04:13:00]  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say.  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two because Opie is.  Press button, you big loser.  Press and button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us and we can't take it.  I was listening and Opie is a prick to guess.  You don't have a sense of humor?  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah, we're on the air.  Okay.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  We got a machine.  No, thanks.  Look what it did to you.  I know.  Would you like a beer or something to loosen up? 
[04:13:30]  No, I don't need a beer.  No?  No.  It's not about needing it.  It's just, you know, you want to hang out.  Yeah, no, I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  I never started.  You didn't?  No.  You've never had a beer in your life?  I had a couple.  I've had beers.  I just never got a taste for it.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Michael feels bad too now.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Listen, Richard, you're a real radio whore, aren't you?  Well, me and your mom.  How many shows are you going to be on, man?  I mean, come on.  What's the problem? 
[04:14:00]  What other shows would be on a radio show?  He's not funny.  He's, like, miserable.  He can't even go with the flow.  I mean, you know.  Well, we busted his balls the last two days.  Well, I mean, that's what comedians are all about.  But I really like you anyway, man.  You're a good guy.  All right.  Cool.  I don't care.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  Brian, what's going on?  Richard, I was thinking, just thinking back to some time when I was watching the UPN network  and your brilliant sitcom Platypus Man.  Right.  Oh, that's great. 
[04:14:30]  You were on that?  It sucked.  It did suck.  Well, finally somebody is.  All right.  I'll take that one.  It did suck.  Come on.  It was a bad show.  Did you see that, man?  No.  How big an idiot are you for watching it, though?  What do you have going on in your life that you were watching a show that bad?  Come on.  Stick a knife in your forehead.  Where are you from originally?  New York City.  New York City.  Brooklyn.  And you never made it out to the island when you were living here?  Yeah, I did.  But it was crappy then.  Right.  Governors was a crappy club then.  Now it's gotten a lot better.  Now it's great. 
[04:15:00]  Well, the beaches you went to out there, right?  Yes.  You know what I did recently?  I went on speaking of the beach.  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Forget it.  Oh, no.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies.  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say.  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two because Opie is.  Press button, you big loser.  Press button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us and we can't take it.  I was listening and Opie is a prick. 
[04:15:30]  You don't have a sense of humor?  Can you say prick on the radio?  Yeah.  You can say prick, sure.  They keep changing it.  Really?  Yeah.  You just can't use it in the context of a unit.  Right.  Yeah, you could call someone a prick.  You could say don't be a prick.  Okay.  You can't say I grabbed his and then used the word.  Glenn, what's up?  Oh, man.  You guys got to cut Richard Jennings a break.  We are.  First of all, the hanging up yesterday and then having him wait out in the lobby.  Oh, I haven't laughed his heart since Gary Coleman.  See, Nancy from Jersey.  Opie, you are such a rude, unfunny a-hole. 
[04:16:00]  See?  See?  You're being bad to Richard.  See that?  All right.  People are mad at you.  All right.  What were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say anything.  No, be quiet now.  We'll do it your way.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  You're a big shot radio guy.  Let's not let him be funny on our show.  We're the funny ones.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We only bring in the comedians to abuse that.  Don't say we.  I was being nice.  I want to sit here.  I'm listening to what you're saying.  And we allow...  He's being a jackal.  We allow a lot of people to be funny on our show.  Yeah.  So you can do your research.  We allow them to be funny. 
[04:16:30]  Well, you know what I mean.  We allow them to be funny.  This is now officially turning uncomfortable for me.  We have this show, and people come in, and they're funny, and we don't care.  All right.  Okay.  All right?  So what were you going to say?  I forgot.  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What were we talking about, Ed?  I don't remember either.  You're being rude.  It was something about Long Island, right?  Yeah.  And governors.  Yeah.  And then you were going to say something.  I don't want to talk about this.  Let's do whatever.  Do whatever it is you do.  We don't do anything, Richard.  This is what we do.  We just sit here and do nothing for four hours a day. 
[04:17:00]  We goof on people and make them feel uncomfortable.  That's our gig.  We have to abuse the comics.  No.  All right.  We're trying to get along that.  We love the comics.  We've had a lot of comics on here.  We had Jay in here yesterday.  We had Jay.  We have Norton comes in all the time.  We've had Andrew Dice Clay in here.  Ron Jeremy's coming in a little while.  He's not a comic.  He's pretty funny.  He wanted to be a comic at one point.  He's got some comics on him.  Have you watched some of those movies?  You watched his movies?  Yeah.  I've seen a couple.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen those back in his heyday. 
[04:17:30]  Yeah.  He's great.  He's quite the guy.  He's...  I like...  I...  You know, people think that...  We should say this on the air.  That people...  This is a misconception that people have that men like porno, which is false.  It's men's penises that like porno.  Right.  He's like, any guy, no matter how stupid he is, he's going, this movie sucks.  It has a bad watch.  Any people, but the penis is going, it's genius.  It speaks to me.  I haven't seen performances like these in years.  I must have it for my collection.  So I like Ron Jeremy.  He's a big, disgusting character. 
[04:18:00]  Uh-oh.  Some people call him a hedgehog.  I got a porno dish, a satellite dish that plays porno 24 hours a day.  Yeah?  Plays other things, too.  You like your porno?  You got a steady?  You got a steady gown?  You're never disappointed.  You never sit there going, gee, I didn't think it would end that way.  It was really good right up until then.  Up until the money shot.  And then the whole plot just fell apart.  What the hell happened there?  Tony Camacho, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  It's Tony Camacho from Rascals in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Now, it's the only room that Rich is not working in the New York area and Jersey, whatever. 
[04:18:30]  And I still got to say he's the funniest man on the planet.  There you go.  The proof is go watch this man perform and then get some opinions because Rich is funny.  What's your act like?  I'm really, I haven't seen your stand-up.  Never?  Just like, no.  You have HBO?  Yeah.  I saw him on HBO and stuff.  You are?  Yeah, he's very funny.  You never saw me ever?  I swear, no.  You're the target demo, man.  I know.  You're an Italian guy from New York, aren't you?  I, I, I.  Are you Italian? 
[04:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  From Brooklyn.  The target demo, never saw the act.  It's, uh, you know, what can I say?  It's your act.  You stand there, you talk.  Is it?  I stand there and I talk.  Is it filthy?  No.  No.  No.  Very clean?  It's a little filthy toward the end.  Yeah.  But the whole thing isn't filthy, no.  Okay.  No, it's not.  A little lifestyle stuff?  It's, it's, you wouldn't like it.  No?  It's not annoying.  It doesn't embarrass anyone.  I like all forms of comedy.  It's not, it's not into humiliating anybody.  We like all forms of comedy.  Let's break them down like a rifle. 
[04:19:30]  No.  We like Jim Norton, who's as dirty as they get, and we love Brian Regan, who's as clean  as they get, and everyone in between, Jay Moore and the rest of the gang.  So you just have to go through a certain amount of abuse until you get to be part of  the Opie and Anthony family.  Yeah.  I think we just got off on the wrong foot, somehow.  Yeah, that was, that was how that happened.  That was Anthony, that was Anthony's idea yesterday.  I don't know how that happened.  I think it's maybe because we hung up on you, and then when you were here, we called you  from the lobby, which would be really funny if it wasn't happening to me. 
[04:20:00]  Hey, I like that.  See?  It's always funny unless it's you.  Yeah, it's always funny unless it's happening, unless you're the guy.  Well, why don't we take a break and regroup?  All right, we'll regroup, Opie, and we'll like start over.  All right.  We'll start fresh.  If you start yelling at us, we're just going to turn the mics on.  I'm not yelling.  Yeah, be prepared, affiliates.  We might just pop the mics up.  Yeah, because if he's going to yell at us, everyone else has to hear it, too.  Right.  I'm not.  Richard, Jenny.  I think we should go to an Italian restaurant, all three of us. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'll forget my gun inside, and then it'll all be fine.  Now presenting comedian Richard Jenny.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, so Richard Jenny sent us a CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  Of his latest material on the situation in Afghanistan and terrorism and patriotism in America.  Richard Jenny, who likes going on other shows and agreeing that there are clone shows out there, clone radio shows, 
[04:21:00]  and sits there lapping ass and agreeing with people that are saying that there are clone shows out there,  and then Richard Jenny will jump right on the bandwagon and start lapping, just frothing that ass,  just lapping away, lapping like a bunch of kittens around a little milk thing.  You know how they, with their tongues, lap it.  That Richard Jenny?  Yeah, the guy begged to be on our show for hours.  He sat where Morton is sitting.  He could have brought it up while he was on our show. 
[04:21:30]  No, no, he ain't going to bring it up.  He goes on certain shows, and when this show is brought up as a clone show,  Richard Jenny, instead of either shutting up or maybe defending a show that he came on,  will sit there and just lap.  Yeah.  Suckle, suckle, suckle, Richard Jenny.  That Richard Jenny?  Well, that was after he begged to be on our show, too.  Yeah.  Begged, begged, begged. 
[04:22:00]  Well, we should have kept him out on the phone.  We threw so much abuse at him, and he took it all.  Like a big, you ever see a dog that's been chasing a frisbee in 90-degree weather?  That tongue that hangs out, is just dripping.  That's it.  Just to find an ass and lap away.  There it is.  That Richard Jenny?  Yeah, that Richard Jenny.  Just to have to clear that up.  Well, he sent us a CD of his latest stuff on the whole situation, talking about the terrorist attacks and the Taliban and the Taliban and Afghanistan and all that crap. 
[04:22:30]  Afghanistan.  Quick stuff.  I'm glad you came out.  I'm glad you came out tonight, because it proves that you're not altering your life because of what happened.  You know, that's great.  And I think we all do.  You know, let's be realistic.  We have to alter our lives a little bit.  But, you know, for example, like tonight, even though it looks really good on me, I decided not to wear my turban. 
[04:23:00]  You know, because that's like a fashion don't right now, isn't it?  The turban.  You don't see a lot of people.  Anybody wearing a turban?  Nobody.  That's kind of funny, right?  I've heard Voss do better.  How about those turbans?  I know the struggle.  Well, let's try the next one.  Maybe the next one's a little better.  You know, last night I turned on the television and Miss Cleo was wearing a fireman's helmet. 
[04:23:30]  She had a helmet.  You know, she was, oh, I'm getting into the firehouse, man.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  So Miss Cleo, why would Miss Cleo, who is a Jamaican.  Oh, because she was showing her support for the firemen, I guess.  Oh, I got you. 
[04:24:00]  I got you.  Because it seems like a lot of people are wearing like NYPD hats.  Yeah.  And fire hats.  Yeah.  So you take it to the nth degree, and then someone like Ms. Cleo would have one on TV.  And that's why that's funny, because when you exaggerate stuff, it becomes funny.  And she's the most ridiculous person you could come up with.  I pull back the curtain.  I'm pulling back the comedy curtain, yes.  Yes, when you over-exaggerate and say someone has a five-foot mule, it's funny. 
[04:24:30]  Five feet would just be ridiculous.  Ridiculous, the point where that would be funny, right?  Dale from Jersey, Richard Jenny should turn up that laugh track.  I could barely hear it.  Yeah, why was it so low?  Well, why don't we try the third track that he sent us, Anthony?  All right.  Richard Jenny, this was recorded at the Improv in L.A.  I'm glad you're here.  You're in a good mood, see?  People are nicer in L.A. lately, have you noticed?  They're a little bit nicer, a little more sense of community. 
[04:25:00]  Today I was on the 405, I cut a guy off, and he fired his gun, like, over my car.  You know, he could have hit me.  He was like, eh, no problem.  What a guy.  Oh, okay.  See, that's because, like, they shoot at each other, or they did ten years ago there on the highway.  Well, no, they have a lot of drive-by shooting, so.  But the guy's being nice, and he shot over him.  But it's ridiculous, because why would he shoot anyway if he was nice? 
[04:25:30]  Was that funny?  Why doesn't Jim Norton want to participate in this segment of our radio show?  Because comics can't bash other comics unless they know each other and are good friends.  Oh, I see.  Then they could really bash him.  Drive-by shooting joke's always funny, though, right?  You don't want to burn your bridges in comedy.  You don't want to.  See, like, the gang member was being really nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, he shot over his car instead of shooting him.  Oh. 
[04:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Well, let's try the fourth track.  B-4, or B-52.  Oh, I screwed up the punchline.  Does it have to be A or B?  Oh.  It's always B.  All right, let's go to this track.  Well, I say nuke him.  Nuke him, damn it.  Yeah.  If they're stupid enough to blow up the World Trade Center, we're dumb enough to nuke him.  Fry him up, put some frosting on him, sell him in the mall. 
[04:26:30]  Take out the Cinnabon, put in the Talibon.  That's my attitude.  Oh, I cut it there.  Yeah, that's what it was called.  Damn it.  And look, I don't mean to be xenophobic or jingoistic, and I'm sure I'll feel those way  even after I find out what those words mean.  I don't know why that one's funny.  Do you, Ant?  Do you have a clue on that one, possibly?  What?  Oof. 
[04:27:00]  That was weird.  You ever get that thing where you're just about dozing and your leg kicks?  That just happened to me.  God, that's so weird when that happens.  You want to try this track again, Rick?  And then it's going to work on us?  Are we in spots?  No, no.  Oh.  Well, let's try this one.  We have only a couple more left here.  I'm just frustrated.  I just want to kill somebody.  He said, but who are you going to kill?  We don't know who they are.  Well, we know somebody did it.  We know they're bad.  Let's kill somebody bad. 
[04:27:30]  Let's bomb OJ.  Bring back OJ.  Nice.  Bomb OJ.  We're coming.  What?  Why would that ever be funny?  See, because OJ is like a bad guy, but he got away with it.  Sure you don't want to burn this bridge, Norton.  Really?  It's like an old rickety wooden bridge.  There are plenty of nice suspension bridges out there and all ties to the tunnels. 
[04:28:00]  There's other connections.  I don't think the Richard Jenny Memorial Bridge is really one that needs to stay standing.  Well, we're enjoying the comedy stylings of Richard Jenny, Anthony.  Comedy stylings.  He sent it to us.  Okay.  We got two more left.  Here we go.  Oh, please.  I'm just frustrated.  You know, people, there's always people in the crowd going, you know, war is bad. 
[04:28:30]  You know, I don't like war.  It's bad.  Really?  Let me get a pen.  I know that.  We shouldn't go to war.  I don't like war.  Well, who does?  What are you going to do when somebody blows your country up?  Send them a sarcastic note?  Dear Osama.  Well, if you were planning to ruin our weekend, you certainly succeeded.  I don't think we should go to war.  What do you want to do?  Sneak into his camp and key his camel?  What?  Be quiet, sir. 
[04:29:00]  What?  Be quiet, sir.  Like, that's going to freak him out.  They keyed my camel.  These people will stop at nothing.  Wow, I need a drink.  Okay, terrific.  Did he go on like three in the morning after everyone got completely hammered at other clubs?  They don't even sound into it.  They're just, ha, ha.  Oh, he's joking about the touchy situation.  It's like when you get some gimp up there or some diseased person or a midget or a CP or something gets up and they're a comedian. 
[04:29:30]  The deaf comic woman.  Do you know I've been doing comedy for an hour, 20 years, and I got to tell you, I have a hard of hearing.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Let me clap.  She's deaf.  She was on WLIW over the weekend.  Was she?  The public TV station in this area.  Was it during one of the pledge drives?  Oh, it was so bad.  You can get a tote bag.  Hi, I'm going to be a radio person.  I'm going to be my rim ball. 
[04:30:00]  What's her name?  Kathy Buckley?  I couldn't even tell you.  Is she the one from Facts of Life?  No.  She's got palsy.  Palsy.  Jerry.  Deaf palsy.  Look at you.  I don't know the difference.  Who cares?  Let's go to Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Hey, are you sure this isn't Norris doing Jenny?  You know, that could be it.  Now, now, who appreciates my CD now, huh?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, your CD's great compared to this crap. 
[04:30:30]  Oh, gee, there's a compliment.  Thank you.  Your CD is very funny.  What's that?  I like the Voss CD.  It is very good.  Especially since he thanked all his friends on it.  You know what?  The one that's in the store now?  You dirty little creep.  Hey, Norton, the one that's in the store at Border Books has your name on it.  Oh, it's a new one?  Yeah.  Well, no, it's the same one, but they just did, like, a new copy for the, uh, you know.  A new cover?  What, did you run through the store with little stick-ons?  No.  Stupid.  I had it reprinted.  That's cool.  Yeah, and I, you know, I mean, of course, O&A are way up top, and Norton, you're way  at the bottom, but still. 
[04:31:00]  Please go out, buy the Voss CD so he can afford to buy a 62 Rambler next week.  Oh, this car's cruising.  You know what?  Like his Mercedes that he bought.  You hear he bought a Mercedes?  Yeah, with, how many miles were on it when you bought it?  77.  Another Jew buying a Nazi mobile.  77,000 miles.  That's great.  2,000 miles less than on your chin, okay?  They're showing some pride for your heritage, Voss.  Another Jew buying a Nazi car.  No, yeah, but it's not new.  That's fantastic.  It's not new, so the money didn't go to Germany, okay?  Do you go faster when you're driving Doc Martens? 
[04:31:30]  Ugh.  You know, this is a guy that just moved out of his mother's house a year and a half ago,  okay?  And your car has 190,000 miles, doesn't it?  No, I bought a brand new vehicle today, actually.  Did you really?  What kind?  A Saturn, as I always get.  A Saturn.  You got a Saturn?  The Saturn.  I like the cushy, huggy commercials about how you can just bring it in and eat a jelly  donut while they fix something.  A Saturn, please.  No, here's what you do when you're waiting.  You realize that they almost didn't approve the loan because there was a, what's the word 
[04:32:00]  when your credit card hasn't been paid?  A delinquent.  Delinquent payment.  It turns out these vultures in Citibank, it was a $15 delinquency on a JCPenney card.  Ah, well, that's all.  They don't care about the amount.  You didn't pay it.  I almost didn't get my loan.  Listen to this.  Listen, I owed a credit card.  I owed them $3,000 seven years ago.  They stopped sending me bills.  They never sent me a bill.  So I stopped paying them.  I didn't know where to go.  Well, yeah, that's what you do.  Well, I didn't know where to send the money, right?  I thought they went out of business or something. 
[04:32:30]  You showed them.  This is true.  I thought MasterCard went out of business.  No, no.  I thought it was.  What is that?  That Visa thing was a fad.  Well, anyhow, I get a bill a month ago for $7,000.  I owed them three.  Now it's seven.  Of course it is.  Right?  No interest.  And I got to go to court and, you know, I'm not going to drive the Mercedes.  I don't want them to take that.  But I owe them seven grand.  Yeah, that'll knock off $400.  You know what?  I didn't call to take any abuse today.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, boss. 
[04:33:00]  Thank you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I literally drove into the city right from this place.  It was a nightmare.  And a bird took a dump on my window.  Brand new, right?  And whoever is killing birds in New York, please continue.  I hate them.  Matt, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I've heard eulogies for crack-addicted AIDS babies that were funnier than that Richard  Jenny crap.  Awful.  Well, we got two more to get through.  Major Dan says, I'd rather be halftime entertainment at a Taliban soccer game than sit through another 
[04:33:30]  minute of that ass.  Hey, put another of your foot hacksawed off.  Here's another track from Richard Jenny, Anthony.  Oh, we got to go to war.  You know what we should send?  Tony Soprano.  That would be cool.  People who have experience in this stuff.  Send over Tony Soprano disguised as Jesse Jackson.  What?  When they're not looking, he takes off the mask, gets out the piano wire. 
[04:34:00]  George Bush says hello.  Five minutes, you're done.  There's Tony Soprano in front of the cave.  Yeah, White House, please.  Yeah.  How you doing, George?  Okay, he's gone.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  He had an accident.  Fent down.  He was kissing a rug.  Boom, his head fell off.  I don't know how it happened.  There's people in our country talking about how smart these people are.  You know, they're not good people, but you've got to admit, they're pretty smart.  That's smart, folks, to blow up the World Trade Center. 
[04:34:30]  You know what's smart?  Building the World Trade Center.  That's smart.  Ah, now he's going to get that.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, Richard Jenny.  What is their point?  They have no point, okay?  These people make the Flintstones look like the Jetsons.  They're not good people.  You know what he was trying to do there?  He knew his material sucked really bad, so he's like, well, I'll get the sympathy thing.  I'll see something else about the World Trade Center being built up.  Building it.  Building it. 
[04:35:00]  Yeah, that'll get an applause.  Yeah.  Maybe that'll wake him up.  Let me tell you what's smarter than destroying it.  Building it, everybody.  Building it.  Paul E. from Lawrence saying, at least Jenny's trying new material, Voss.  Wow.  Wow, that hurt.  And finally, Anthony, the last track from the Richard Jenny thing that he sent us.  Oh, please.  One more.  And Jenny didn't even ask us any questions.  You know they still stone people over there in a Taliban? 
[04:35:30]  You commit a crime, put you in the middle of the street, take rocks, throw them at your head until you die.  And that's if you have a really good lawyer.  That's if you have, like, the Johnny Cochran of Kabul.  And you're waiting in your cell and he comes in going, all right, Ahmet, hold on to your turban.  You're not going to believe the deal I made for you.  Now, they wanted to rip off your legs and set you on fire.  But I pulled a favor and I got it knocked down to a stoning. 
[04:36:00]  Who's got the best lawyer in Afghanistan?  Yeah.  Shut up!  Shut up!  All right.  Well, there you go.  Just a few of the comic stylings.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Well, he sent it in, Anthony.  He wanted us to play.  Let me shield my eyes.  Hold on.  I know where this goes.  He's god-awful.  Oh, my God. 
[04:36:30]  Stick to talking about your kids on stage.  Oh!  Wow, that sounds like it came apart real good.  Did you get it in the eye?  Did Richard Jenny get you in the eye?  I got a piece in the eye that time.  A piece of his CD?  That's a great one.  Oh, there it is.  Wow.  That was good stuff.  He's funny.  He's a funny guy.  Just lap it.  Lap it!  Matt, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys? 
[04:37:00]  Hey.  Dude, I just got to say one thing.  Yeah.  That bit sucked.  What bit?  That last Richard Jenny bit.  That bit sucked.  It was supposed to suck.  You guys, that was an old...  I mean, Norton.  Yes, sir.  Norton, you were totally...  You didn't say a word.  They were doing an adequate enough job.  Oh, no.  I don't want to hear that.  But, no, I didn't trash it because we're all doing terrorism material.  And it's like, I'm thinking of my stuff as I'm listening to his.  I'm like, yeah, I'm sure yours is good.  Oh, guys, that was horrible. 
[04:37:30]  It was supposed to be horrible.  Don't you get it?  Yeah, but, I mean, you guys didn't make fun of it at all.  I mean...  It spoke for itself how bad it was.  Oh, my God.  It was supposed to make you uncomfortable in your car.  Oh.  That someone could be this bad.  Well, guess what?  I'm not in my car.  I came from at home.  And guess what?  I was so uncomfortable.  He's talking about, you know, stonings in Afghanistan.  The audience should have picked up rocks and stoned him while he was on the stage.  And, dude, dude, they did make fun of it.  Because I'm sitting here as a comic, and I just told this to Ann off the air, and I'm listening.  And I'm just like, if that was me, I was, like, cringing. 
[04:38:00]  You didn't say nothing.  He was doing a fine job.  Oh, my God.  All I'm hanging himself by himself.  You guys suck.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to hang up on Matt to explain some of the things we do on this fine Opie and Anthony show.  I don't even think it's...  Sometimes you don't have to, like, accent it and make it funnier or worse.  You just let the material speak for itself.  There you go.  Richard Jenny is an unfunny fuck.  Ah, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on. 
[04:38:30]  You can't use the F word.  Richard Jenny is unfunny, okay?  And that material was supposed to make you just cringe in your car and squirm and get uncomfortable.  That's what that was about.  Oh, my God.  People don't even get some of the things we do anymore.  It wasn't about us, you know, throwing the material on and completely abusing him.  The material itself made him look ridiculous.  And that's what we were attempting to do there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And to see Jim Norton sit there like a pussy and not make fun of him was worth the price of admission. 
[04:39:00]  I am a pussy, I admit it.  What's the problem?  You got a TV project in the works with Richard Jenny?  I got nothing going.  Another Platypus Man?  Platypus Man.  I'm a worm.  Are they going to be doing Platypus Man again?  Worst sitcom in TV history.  Platypus Man.  Even worse than Homeboys from Outer Space.  What movie was he in, Richard Jenny?  I recently saw one.  And, like, he popped up and I'm like, he's in this movie?  The mask he was in. 
[04:39:30]  Oh, right.  Okay.  That one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The mask.  The mask.  I thought you said recent movie.  No, no.  I didn't say recent.  I said I had seen it recently.  It was on cable.  Oh.  But I was like, oh, I didn't know he was in this.  That really bums me that some of the listeners didn't get that.  The guy was a douche to us.  Not some.  That guy.  He begged and pleaded to be on our show.  We went through Ron and Fez begging and pleading.  And then he sat outside the studio for two and a half hours because we flat out didn't want him on the show.  He kept calling. 
[04:40:00]  It's a really – no, I'm not going to play the bit, Rick.  It takes forever.  And then he's just begging and lapping us and we finally let him in and he did – I'm not going to lie.  He did okay stuff when Ron Jeremy was in here.  And then he turned and went on another show and completely trashed us.  It's like, you pussy.  He had the chance to do it in front of our face.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  So then he sends this CD of god-awful material.  And I'm thinking, oh, my God, the listeners are going to get this.  We're just going to play it and maybe make a couple comments here and there. 
[04:40:30]  But for the most part, you're supposed to be uncomfortable and squirm because the material sucks.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, look who's on line six.  Rich or Jenny?  Opie and Anthony.  What's up, Rich or Jenny?  I got a call from New York.  You guys are trashing my material and trashing me and accusing me of all these horrible things.  What?  Who said that?  I got a call from New York.  Was it Rich Voss?  No, it wasn't Rich Voss. 
[04:41:00]  Hey, Richard, we got the CD of your latest material on tourism and what's going on in Afghanistan.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Really?  It was the worst stuff I've ever heard in my life.  Opie, I kind of liked it, Opie.  I don't understand why you're getting like this.  And you knew it was bad when you were doing it because then you went for the cheap applause  saying, you know, we should rebuild the Trade Center.  And then you got your first applause of the CD.  Right.  What are you trying to do? 
[04:41:30]  Well, I was trying to, you know, I was trying to do material about the World Trade Center.  But now you're passing it out to radio stations and we played it and we barely commented.  We let the material speak for itself.  Right.  It was horrendous.  Really?  See, now, I heard you said it wasn't original or something.  No, we didn't say that.  No, that was Voss's material.  Yeah.  And then we were talking about Rich Voss.  Oh, okay.  We said at least Richard Jennings trying to write new material.  That's what we said about that.  All right.  At least you're trying.  But then...  But you didn't like it? 
[04:42:00]  No, it was horrible.  You thought it sucked.  People were calling up saying it sucked.  Are you getting big laughs on the road with that stuff?  Right now I'm headlining at New York, New York and Las Vegas and it's sold out every  night and people like it.  So it just goes to show you, you know, everybody's different when it comes to comedy.  But we really have a bigger problem than your stupid material.  What's your bigger problem?  You were in this studio, Richard, right?  Yeah.  And you had the chance to talk to Aunt Nye, right?  Yes.  And speak your mind, right?  You got it.  And you did not do it.  And then you went on another radio show and then lapped someone's ass for the whole morning 
[04:42:30]  as this guy was talking about shows out there that are clones.  Right.  You're a pussy.  You had the chance to say it to our face.  I'm a pussy.  I had a chance to say this to your face.  First of all, we talked during the break, okay?  Your people should know this.  We talked during the break and you said, oh, you know, we're just kidding around up here.  This isn't for real.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know, we're just, this is what we do.  This is our show.  You believe that.  You're so stupid. 
[04:43:00]  We lulled you in.  Am I supposed to go on somebody else's show and defend you guys?  What am I supposed to do?  You're a pussy.  Why don't you speak your mind?  If you didn't believe what he was saying, then you should have said something.  But instead, you're like, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  All right.  Let me, let's see who's a pussy here.  Am I a pussy or are you a pussy?  You won't even mention the guy's name, speaking of pussy.  The guy's name is Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  You ripped off his act.  You don't do it as well.  Hey, Richard.  And if you're so insecure.  Hey, Richard.  Richard.  Oh, now you're saying that.  Why didn't you say it to our face when you're in the studio? 
[04:43:30]  That's what I'm getting at.  You had every.  Why didn't I say it to you?  You had every chance.  I didn't say it to him either.  If that's what you think of our show, you should have said it while you were sitting here right next to us.  Hey, now you're going to tell me what I'm supposed to say on a radio show?  Why not?  I didn't say it on his show either.  I didn't mention your name on his show.  Oh, but you sat there and agreed all morning.  Why are you so insecure about it?  Because you know what?  You were lapping his butt.  You were lapping his butt.  Do you care if I didn't do a radio show?  They went, no.  They're not our competitors.  We don't care.  Why is it so important to you?  You were lapping his butt. 
[04:44:00]  I was lapping his butt.  Lapping.  Lapping.  All right.  And that's why you played my material and made everybody call up and make fun of it for 20 minutes.  No one called up.  Because you're mad about that.  No, no one called up.  We didn't make it.  I heard a lot of people called up.  We didn't make anybody call.  He said, oh, he sucks.  We don't like him.  He's terrible.  Why do you have him on your show?  You know, then your spies are wrong because that's not what we did.  That's what I heard.  We said Richard Janney sent this CD of material.  Let's play it.  All right.  Well, let me just say, why is it that people like you who don't have any actual comedy talent 
[04:44:30]  have to get listeners by making fun of people like me who do have talent?  Yeah, you have a lot of talent.  It's obvious.  Hey, I do it by myself, dude.  I don't do it with buttons and noises and sound effects and writers and idiots in the studio.  I do it by myself.  Writers.  Well, maybe you should get a few of those things, Richard.  I don't need them, dude.  I haven't had a great career without them.  Oh, yeah.  Is that where Platypus Man came from?  Platypus Man was great.  All right.  Platypus Man sucked.  I'll go with you there.  And it's a radio show.  Of course, you have other people involved and you play sound effects and stuff. 
[04:45:00]  What I'm getting at is I was very disappointed.  You begged to be on our show for a long time, right?  I did not beg.  For Ron and Fez, you didn't beg?  Where's the begging?  I went to...  You want me to get Ron and Fez?  Ron, Ron.  He was calling me every day and saying, you know, Richard really wants to get on.  We're like, I don't know if he's going to fit in with what we do, blah, blah, blah.  So we finally have you in and we kind of got along after we messed with you in the hallway  and then you came in.  Yeah, you wouldn't let me in the studio for two hours.  Because we don't need you to be, you know, to be funny. 
[04:45:30]  We were funny on our own.  And then we brought...  Okay, but it's not right to say that I begged.  I got Ron and Fez.  Holy...  That was a friend of mine.  I knew he knew you.  I knew you guys had a big audience.  Dude, a comedian...  I'm in town to promote something.  I don't think any other comedian begged as much as you did to get on our show.  That is a fact.  I went to Ron and I asked him, I asked him, I says, go tell these guys you know me and  I'm funny and they'll put me on.  I was in town promoting something.  And then...  You had a big audience.  I wanted to be on your show.  How is that begging?  And then I just have a problem with you being a phony.  You're on our show. 
[04:46:00]  We had kind of a good time with Ron Jeremy and all that.  And then you're on another Howard show.  They're going to dump out.  That's the reason why we say it another way.  And you had the chance to say, oh, come on, that's hogwash.  But you did it.  You just went with it because it probably wouldn't be good for your career to disagree.  I also had a chance to go off on you guys and I didn't do that.  I didn't even mention your name.  I didn't even mention your name on the show.  They wouldn't allow it.  Oh, I didn't even know.  Well, I didn't know that.  I didn't know I'm not allowed to mention it. 
[04:46:30]  I had a chance to go off and start saying all kinds of things about how you made me sit  in the lobby and all this other crap.  I didn't.  I just let it go.  You got to admit, you do have an influence from that guy.  Oh, see?  You had the chance to say it on our show, but now you're saying it.  And who are you influenced by, Richard?  Mostly Howard.  Howard Stern.  No, no.  Everybody's influenced by somebody.  Right.  But how do you think your radio show would sound if I played it 30 seconds at a time  and had people call up and make fun of it?  No, we play the tracks as they were on the CD. 
[04:47:00]  And you didn't like them?  It was bad.  Maybe it's not my type of humor.  Even if it was like the first two days after the show, you still think that material would  suck.  First two days after the attack.  No time to make it work.  Just first right out of the box.  You still think it would suck.  Did you drive around L.A. with the CD in your car thinking it was really good and I can't  wait to get it out to radio stations?  No, I thought...  Look at you.  Look at you.  That's someone that's unfunny.  You know, and you're not the only radio station where PR people send it to.  We sent it all over.  A lot of people played it.  You're the only one that took 40 minutes to tell everybody how bad it sucks because I 
[04:47:30]  told Howard Stern.  Sorry, I can't say his name.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We didn't say how...  We just let the material speak for itself.  Yeah, we didn't tell people to call up or anything.  Yeah, like you guys aren't screening the calls.  Like you don't have the guy there going, oh, here's a guy who hates him.  Let's put him on.  You know what?  I would have to go listen to the tape again, but I don't even think we put one person on.  Rich Voss we put on.  That was it.  Well, but that's my point, though.  Between stand-up and doing the radio, I mean, it's a much harder thing to do stand-up comedy 
[04:48:00]  in a radio show.  I can't hang up on people or play noises over them.  I don't have some people helping me.  It's just a more difficult thing to do.  And we can't go out on the air every day and say the same thing we said yesterday.  That's true.  All I'm saying is next time have a backbone.  And tell you that you suck right to your face.  Well, if that's what you thought, I don't think you thought that.  I didn't think that.  Until someone else was talking bad about us, and then you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wasn't, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you didn't even hear the show. 
[04:48:30]  You're getting this third hand, aren't you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're getting this third hand.  Oh, no, everyone knows we listen every day, right?  Did you hear what I said?  It got back to us.  You didn't hear what I said?  It got back to us.  It got back to you.  I could have.  In many ways than one.  I could have went off.  I didn't go off at all.  I spent two hours sitting in your lobby.  I had a chance to get even with you, and I didn't take it.  Oh, because we ended up doing good radio that day.  What I'm just trying to tell you is next time.  That was fun that day.  I got news for you.  I thought it went well.  Okay, but all I'm trying to say is next time have a backbone, whether it's, you know, you're 
[04:49:00]  not being treated right on our show or if you're on another show and you  don't agree with what the host is saying, have a freaking backbone and don't worry about  how it's going to affect your career and you're standing with the show you're on.  Okay, but I don't have a backbone.  I'm a pussy.  You're not a pussy.  You have a backbone.  Oh, God.  I knew you were going to do that.  Next.  Everybody, Richard Jennings. 
[04:49:30]  Those are the times I just like to sit back and watch opesine neurosis at work.  You enjoyed it.  I just love sitting back and watching and going, oh, it's just a bunch of phonies.  Bunch of phonies.  What? 
[04:50:00]  All right.  What?  I would play the material again, but if we broke the CD.  Yeah.  And I wouldn't say a word.  No, you know.  He's calling back.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B.  and Anthony show.  O.B.  and Anthony.  Welcome back to the O.B. 
[04:50:30]  and Anthony radio program.  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B.  and Anthony show.  You haven't seen two girls, one cup yet?  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right.  Roll them.  I won't even face them.  All right.  Here you go.  Oh, is that funny?  And we like to tape it for the internet.  So this is...  I'm still trying to get Kim Kardashian, ladies and gentlemen.  This is two girls, one cup.  Best camera for Colin.  What is this nonsense?  Well, what do you see so far?  I see an Indian girl and a white girl, and they're pulling each other once, pulling the 
[04:51:00]  top down.  That's it.  That's right.  Exposing her boobs.  Just exposing the boobs.  There you go.  Nice, right, Colin?  Yeah.  Very nice, actually.  All right.  Hey, well...  Oh, God!  Why'd it come out the texture?  Turn, turn.  Why?  Why does it come out the texture of ice cream, though?  That's the only amazing part.  See, that's why I think it's fake.  Why aren't you watching?  Turn around.  Colin, you gotta watch.  Why don't you just fucking be a man?  Colin, you gotta watch.  It's making me sad.  You gotta watch.  Colin. 
[04:51:30]  Colin.  He's gonna be sad.  He's gonna make me sad.  He's gonna be sad.  You made us pause the tape.  Now look at it.  Look at it.  He's gonna be sad.  We're only halfway done.  Look at it.  I didn't think it would phase you.  What a rookie.  Colin, look at that monitor so we can get your pretty face on camera.  Right there.  There's a pail just to get sick.  Now, just watch the rest of it.  You have to watch.  You got past the worst part.  It should remind you of yourself in the business.  All right.  All right.  Roll him. 
[04:52:00]  All right.  Oh, come on.  Now watch it.  Colin, watch.  Watch.  What are you doing?  What's rolling with you?  Colin, stop looking away.  I'm gonna throw up.  You're ruining our radio show.  We had to put pause again.  Colin.  Throw up.  No, it's great.  I'm nuts.  Okay, look.  Let's make it a throw up.  There you go.  She's puking the shit up.  No.  Now watch.  This is.  This is.  She's puking shit into the other girl's mouth.  She's puking shit into the other girl's mouth.  Watch, watch.  Look at that one.  That was a gem. 
[04:52:30]  She puked.  Oh, look.  They're still hungry.  The girls are still hungry, Carl.  Carl has got.  He can't get away from it.  The fucking, the one girl ate the shit and then puked it into the girl's mouth.  Oh, that's a great reaction.  Wow.  How many people have thrown up from watching this?  I thought you said he wasn't gonna be funny.  Bob Kelly, yeah, really, really puked.  That's not positive, huh?  That was disgusting there.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. 
[04:53:00]  These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.  BIRDS CHIRP  BIRDS CHIRP  BIRDS CHIRP  BIRDS CHIRP  Thank you. 
[04:53:30]  Thank you. 
[04:54:00]  Thank you. 
[04:54:30]  Thank you. 
[04:55:00]  Yo, what's up? This is the WWE's John Cena, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:55:30]  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Bob Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Patrice O'Neal on the Opie and Anthony Show.  So it's pretty much going to be him just talking over everybody, screaming, and laughing at his own jokes the whole fucking time.  So enjoy.  Vince is a cold dude, man.  Yeah, this Indian dude.  Yeah, we've never talked to you about that.  I think Jimmy brought it up or something. 
[04:56:00]  You used to fly around with Vince McMahon or something?  In a Learjet.  In a Learjet and write for WWF?  Write for WWF.  Vince McMahon.  There's three people I've met in my life.  You know, you probably can name them, people in your life where you met and you lost your manness.  Like, you try to go, hey, what's happening?  Hey, good to see you, Michael Jackson.  Nice talking to you.  But it's like I met a few people, like maybe four, three or four, where I go, oh, boy.  I was at his house in Stanford writing.  They were rewriting.  Nice house, too.  And he just comes up, hello, Patrice, in his jumpsuit and his everything. 
[04:56:30]  And I just was like, oh, my God.  I was like a little girl, like, hey.  Hi, Mr. McMahon.  Yeah, we've had him on a few times.  And he's a powerful dude, man.  But he's a cold dude.  Now, this one guy, I used to have a turban.  And he goes in.  And none of the wrestlers talk to him personally, you know, except for the big guys.  Like, I'm on a plane with, like, Triple H.  Everybody else got to drive their, like, Hyundai Sonatas from town to town.  But, like, Triple H, Undertaker, those guys, they get on his plane. 
[04:57:00]  So I'm in the back and, you know, watching this whole thing go down.  And he, this guy with a turban, he goes, listen, my family says, please, can you stop making fun of my team?  Turban.  Oh, no.  Because my people.  Tiger, Tiger, Tiger Ali Singh.  Tiger Ali Singh.  He's like, please, don't make fun of the. 
[04:57:30]  He goes, he goes, shut up and put on a turban.  Please, my people.  Thank you.  Put on the turban.  Like the Jerky Boys, dude.  He's just like, my people.  He's like, I don't want to hear that nonsense.  Get out there and put on that stupid turban, you jackass.  It was like, oh, my God.  That's great.  Oh, there's the clip from WWE last night.  By the way, someone's pointing out. 
[04:58:00]  Yeah, they're choking the shit out of.  Someone's pointing out that they taped us on Tuesday, so it's a huge coincidence that.  Really?  Yeah, that the bombings were, what, yesterday?  Yeah, they're choking.  I'm dressed in there.  We're cutting a Christian man's head off.  Yeah, but watch how they take the other dude away.  Yeah.  Like he's the martyr.  Yeah.  It was brutal.  And you know, I think anything is funny, man.  But I was like, this is not good.  They even lifted his hair, like his head, like the way.  Yeah, yeah.  You saw that on that they lifted the Undertaker's head by the hair? 
[04:58:30]  I'm telling you, it was brutal.  What's your thinking, man?  That's a touchy subject.  That is a touchy subject.  To reenact a beheading in a wrestling ring.  Yeah.  Were you responsible for some of the legendary storylines on WWF in recent years?  One that comes to mind?  No, I was the fourth man on the totem pole.  They have a kid there, this young white kid who's the boss. 
[04:59:00]  But if I'd have stayed, I just couldn't deal with what they were asking.  I couldn't deal with that little Learjet with them.  And, you know, I just couldn't do it because they're very corporate.  You have to be committed to their cause.  And I just wasn't committed.  You know what I'm saying?  And I got fired.  What's her name?  Stephanie fired me like six times.  Really?  She kept calling me back and firing me.  But she doesn't realize comics just get fired.  So she goes, you know you're fired, right?  I go, yeah.  I understand.  I do understand. 
[04:59:30]  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to.  What would you get fired for?  Because I had a show.  Yeah.  And I said I can't make it.  And she's like, what?  You're committed?  Yeah.  They want 100% loyalty over there.  I was like, I met Steve Austin.  It was good enough.  What I took from it is how powerful Vince McMahon was and how the rock was cooler than he should  have been.  Yeah.  He was just too accessible.  I didn't want him to be that accessible.  Just like a regular guy.  Hey, man. 
[05:00:00]  Hey, how you doing?  They were real regular guys.  And they kissed the writers' asses because the writers make up scenarios for them to become  whatever.  So they, this little white kid, he has these giant roided up dudes like, ha, ha, ha.  Kissing ass.  And he's like, ah.  Was he good?  What he did?  The kid?  Yeah.  He must have been because he was Vince's right hand dude, man.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Bye-bye.  Do they write scripts or just storylines?  They write everything done. 
[05:00:30]  Really?  There's some who get leeway like Kurt Angle, the biggies.  They can talk.  Yeah.  They can say words that aren't there sometimes.  But the other guys, you stick to the script.  But they do not play around with that, man.  Wow.  He runs that with an iron fist.  He's behind every, he's behind the scenes, sitting there at the, when they come out with  the explosions.  Uh-huh.  He's there like, all right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know,  doing, running it. 
[05:01:00]  The director.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  And to find out any dates, any information, anything you need to know about me, go to  PatriceO'Neal.com.  Or visit me at MySpace slash Tourists in Brazil.  I don't know why I did that.  I'm not that corny.  Somebody had stole my original MySpace and that's what he put, like, cause that's how  he's, you know, he knew me from Brazil.  But that's my shit.  You can't even change it now.  Cause by the time I got it, it was already 8,000 friends.  This nigga had more friends than I got now. 
[05:01:30]  Like, I haven't even doubled the friends that this fucking imposter did.  So if you go to MySpace.com slash Tourists in Brazil, you can get some information on  Patrice O'Neal.  And if you go to PatriceO'Neal.com, it'll tell you all the lovely little places I'll be.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  All right.  So you heard it all.  You're listening to Patrice O'Neal on Rich Vosch.  You're listening to Patrice O'Neal, Bill Burr, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, Colin Quinn,  the whole crew, everybody. 
[05:02:00]  You know, I'm not going to lie.  The best comics in the business are these comics I just read off.  These are the, this is the crew.  These are the people that you want to go see.  Now, if you, if you're in, if you're anywhere and you, anywhere you live and you see their  name in a paper, I want you to come see me at the Arlington Cinema Draft House.  If you see their name, I don't care what I'm saying as funny guys.  Patrice has got to be one of my favorite comics on the planet.  Just watching him with such hatred and sustain towards human life, get up there and perform. 
[05:02:30]  It's magic.  Louis's brilliant.  Uh, Billy.  What can I say about Billy?  That hasn't been said in Philadelphia.  Colin.  Colin, if you, if your ears are quick enough to keep up with his fucking mouth, brilliant.  Brilliant.  Louis C.K., brilliant.  Robert's okay.  You know, he's, he's a good guy, Kelly.  He's, he's, he's finding, he's finding his voice.  No, he's great.  The whole crew.  All right.  How about you guys go fuck yourselves?  Because I got to go.  I've been taking Metamucil.  Have you tried that stuff?  Metamucil?  If you take that at night, it's like pure fiber. 
[05:03:00]  It's the next morning.  It's like cake.  You know what I mean?  It comes right out.  Ooh.  Metamucil.  That's what I'm going to say.  That's my new slogan.  Come see Ridgevoss and a little Metamucil.  I got gigs every week.  I'm in, I'm coming to Detroit, Grand Rapids.  I'm at all these places, you know, a lot of places.  But listen, folks, you know, I sent out some emails, uh, Pittsburgh.  I'm waiting for that call.  You know what I'm saying?  Uh, all right.  That's pretty good.  I think we pretty much got it all in.  Uh, have a fun vacation.
