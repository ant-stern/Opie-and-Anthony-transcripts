<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a deep dive into the Elliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, fueled by details from the New York Post.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Rich Voss (present in studio),  launched into sexually explicit commentary about the scandal, dissecting Spitzer's spending, speculating on his motivations, and analyzing photos of the call girls. Their discussion extended to broader themes of infidelity in politics and marriage, laced with cynical observations about politicians and their wives' reactions.  A caller offered a humorous, albeit crude, explanation for the prostitute's choice of train travel over plane travel (BDSM paraphernalia setting off metal detectors).  The conversation then broadened to other political scandals, including one involving a Detroit mayor.  Callers weighed in on Spitzer's chances of surviving the scandal and the rapid online dissemination of the news.  The hosts also engaged in a furious, offensive tirade against two Boston Herald "Inside Track" gossip columnists, recounting a past negative encounter and playing audio clips to mock them.  Further discussion of the Spitzer scandal included speculation about his wife needing STD testing.  A caller impersonating Robert Kelly from the Burly Bear Network called in, leading to the playing of audio clips from Kelly's show.

The show then shifted to a planned, but ultimately failed, interview with Meat Loaf.  Opie and Anthony expressed immense anger and frustration, reading aloud a series of highly offensive and insulting questions they had prepared for him, targeting his documentary and his performance of "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights."  A comedic bit involving a staged re-enactment of a scene from the "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights" video was also included. Dina Matos McGreevey, ex-wife of former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, called in to offer her perspective on the Spitzer situation and compare it to her own experience.  The hosts continued their angry commentary on Meat Loaf's absence and the unreliability of publicists.

A segment heavily featuring clips from Bobby Kelly's "Burly Bear" show followed.  These clips showcased Kelly's unpredictable and over-the-top style, including threats of violence and bizarre statements.  The hosts discussed the show's low-budget production.  The Meat Loaf debacle resurfaced, leading to further offensive language directed at Meat Loaf and his publicists, along with clips from Meat Loaf's work. The discussion then veered into a frank and vulgar conversation about infidelity, fueled by the Spitzer scandal and Meat Loaf’s absence.  A caller shared their experience working at a college radio station that aired "Burly Bear."  Professional wrestler Aron Sheik called in with a rambling and incoherent message, followed by the playing of a new audio clip filled with insults toward Hulk Hogan.  The segment concluded with a highly explicit account of one host's experiences with massage parlors.

Another segment focused on the Spitzer scandal, particularly his wife's reaction and the perceived motivations behind her remaining with him.  The conversation again involved vulgar and sexually explicit commentary about Spitzer, his wife, and infidelity.  The discussion delved into male and female sexuality with numerous crude and offensive jokes.  A caller, Matt from New Mexico, offered his perspective on preventing infidelity. Other callers shared their experiences, incorporating graphic sexual descriptions, often interrupted by the hosts' sexually explicit and offensive commentary. A digression into a video of a physical altercation (an elderly woman's hat being violently removed) led to further vulgar commentary and mimicry. The show briefly touched on other news, including a reporter being assaulted, ending with more sexually explicit and offensive jokes.

A final segment heavily featured a video of Bobby Kelly’s acting performance, met with vulgar and offensive mockery from the hosts and others in the studio, including Rich Voss (who was eventually asked to leave).  The hosts and others made frequent crude comments and personal attacks.  Mention was made of an upcoming guest, Michael K. Williams, and Bobby Kelly’s CD/DVD release.  The segment ended with an announcement for Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers and an internship opportunity. The overall tone was unprofessional, filled with profanity, personal insults, and offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let him starve.  And then let him starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Brief.  Bobby, please love.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, you okay?  So where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  Oh, my God.  We're done.  We're out.  What is it?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  I want to say good morning to all the hookers.  They can't keep their mouths shut.  They're out there.  Yeah, but is it the hookers' fault?  They're out there.  The hookers that can't keep their mouths shut.  We got hookers coming out of the woodwork here in New York City.  Isn't that a good hooker?  I also slept with him two years ago. 
[00:02:00]  Shut up.  Yeah, a couple of pictures of, well, at least one picture of a girl that says she slept with Elliot Spitzer.  And then a picture of maybe this Kristen girl.  Yeah.  A little face picture.  A little dark-haired minx.  Her face isn't that good.  You didn't think so?  No.  What are you?  What?  No.  I don't know.  She was kind of crawling around.  Her hair was in her face a little bit. 
[00:02:30]  Which page?  Oh, I don't know.  Turn to your workbook pages.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Front page of the New York Post.  Hooked.  Sex addict.  Governor.  Spent $80,000 on call girls.  $80,000.  And then you got a hot blonde.  And it says, I slept with Spitzer.  Call girl Sienna.  Whose own website picture has her face blurred. 
[00:03:00]  Says the governor was a big tipper.  Big tipper?  And look at that body.  Wow-wee.  Jesus.  Wow-wee.  You got to give it to him, I guess.  At least, you know, at least it wasn't one of these situations like, what's his name there?  That stupid English actor jackass that I can't watch one of his movies.  Hugh Grant.  At least it wasn't like that where he's with some goddamn slob.  Hugh Grant.  Hugh Grant.  Oh, I thought this was Kristen. 
[00:03:30]  No.  That's the madam.  No, that's the madam.  That's the gym teacher.  Don't look at her.  I call her the gym teacher because she's not good enough to play the sports, so she's got  to teach.  She's got to teach.  She's not good enough to be the hooker, so she's got to like...  Hell no.  She's the madam.  The madam's always a little...  Yeah.  A little...  But no, Kristen's the one right there.  Oh yeah, she looks really, really good.  Okay, I got confused.  Yeah.  The one picture we have of this Kristen Broad, who's way underground, they're saying, here  in New York City somewhere. 
[00:04:00]  Hiding.  She's either really nervous, she's either really nervous because her family's about to find  out she's a prostitute, or she's like, I am going to get paid.  Yeah.  She's got one of the two things going on, but she might be paranoid, her family's going  to find out.  Supposedly websites that feature her have kind of shut down.  She's in hiding, everybody wants to know what this girl looks like.  Yep, she's the girl everyone's chasing.  She can make some righteous bucks, I think.  She already makes righteous bucks.  I know, but I mean like one of those deals where she makes millions giving an interview 
[00:04:30]  and pictures to maybe the Inquirer or something like that.  By the looks of it, it looks like she might have been making millions already, and she just  wants business as usual for a few more years.  You brought up an interesting point that you think Elliot Spitz is going to be killed.  Oh yeah.  That's interesting.  He pretty much brought down a giant money-making enterprise, this emperor's club.  And there's going to be some more high-profile names that come out. 
[00:05:00]  Oh yeah.  They're not going to be too happy.  There's a rumor that one of the people on the list might be a New York judge.  Well, you know, I guess people just don't understand, guys like this stuff.  They like having sex with attractive women.  Yep.  And if they're in politics and married, have kids, things like Elliot Spitzer, I guess you 
[00:05:30]  have to make a decision.  You either have to sacrifice those urges and continue with your career and your marriage,  business as usual, or you give in to them and hope you don't get caught.  But how many do you think really decide, I'm just going to stick with my career, my marriage,  and how many are actually doing this and not getting caught doing it? 
[00:06:00]  Oh my God.  The number's got to be ridiculous.  I would think it's more than 50%.  I would assume it's more than 50% of these guys in politics, all these, that walk around  with their doting wives and their kids and they parade them out during re-election and  kiss them and they're all huddled around, are just going out and spending money and getting  banged.  Absolutely. 
[00:06:30]  You know who I blame?  The wives.  You got to keep it sloppy.  You got to keep it sloppy.  Keep it a little dirty.  You got to keep it a little dirty.  A little filth in there.  I think something happens in relationships where all of a sudden you forgot that you  used to like getting a little sloppy, a little dirty.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  This sold abroad, you think she gets dirty and a little sloppy in the bedroom?  I don't know.  Probably not.  But I would assume not.  I assume she'd rather have a nice game of tennis with the other wives. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe join the other wives, yeah, for some tea.  And going out shopping and doing lunches and stuff.  I think the broads wreck it for themselves.  When she's dipping the teabag in her water, she's thinking what she used to do and why  he married her.  Right.  I think every single one of us wants a little love and a little lust.  That's the key to every relationship. 
[00:07:30]  I need to write a book through Patrice.  We want the Madonna and the whore together.  Yes!  You want a little dirt and a little slobbery.  Yeah.  As soon as the slobbery goes away, guess what?  Guys start looking around.  They start going to the strip clubs a little more.  They start, let me look at that website online.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, look at that.  And they start getting urges.  Absolutely.  And looking and going, eh, you know, I'm a powerful guy.  Got some cash.  You could go out there and maybe grab some of this stuff up. 
[00:08:00]  I go on a lot of business trips.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  I'm in radio.  Oh, damn.  Hold it.  Wait a minute.  Jesus Christ.  What did I just say?  Do you agree, Jimmy, or what?  I could not agree more.  I mean, it's exactly what happens, I think, in most cases, is that, you know, there's  just guys that no matter what you do for them, they won't be happy.  But I think in a lot of cases, maybe women start having kids, and, you know, they take  on a mother role.  It's a different vibe.  Yeah.  It's hard to be filthy. 
[00:08:30]  We've been doing this radio show for a very long time, and every once in a while we go  down this road, and the women will even call up and go, I'm too tired.  I got a job, too, and I got three kids.  I just don't want to do that anymore.  Well, that's fine, but guess what?  The guy still wants to do that.  And that's where the problem occurs.  There's also something to be said for the chicks this guy was getting at the Empress Club. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  It's beyond anything that he's going to get from his wife.  It's beyond anything he's going to get, just maybe in a discreet relationship kind  of rendezvous situation.  You know, he's going to these things.  He has a certain taste, I guess, in women, and he found it.  He found it in this Emperor's Club.  The thing is, like I said before, you're the governor. 
[00:09:30]  You know, you pretty much are going to sacrifice, or at least really gamble, your entire life's  career.  Everything you've done since school and up till that point is used to attain the position  you're at.  And you're willing to throw that all away for that blonde you saw in the newspaper today.  Well, yeah, you're, you're, you're preaching to the choir.  I know. 
[00:10:00]  It's just an, there's not a guy alive that would, wouldn't roll the dice for this girl.  It's, it's a statement on what guys, what their priorities are, right?  This guy isn't some anomaly that comes around once in a blue moon and you go, Oh my God,  how could he do this?  Look at that girl on the cover of the paper, look at his wife and kids that he goes home  to.  I'm sorry, but you know, that, that's a whole nother frigging league, a whole nother game. 
[00:10:30]  But Silda's not, not a bad broad.  I mean, she's Silda is probably the perfect politician's wife.  As far as the showpiece, he parades her out.  There's a lot of kissing.  There's the arm around as he's waving, as he's getting on his plane or his limo at the  swearing in.  She's right there smiling and all the women are going, Oh, does Silda look good?  But you know something?  Look at the blonde on the paper. 
[00:11:00]  Front page of the post.  That's a whole different story.  By the way, if you squint, you can see her face perfectly.  I know that pixelation or digitizing.  If you just squint a little bit, you see right there.  I learned that with the, um, with the, uh, you know, the cans, the cans growing up, not  growing up.  I mean, we didn't pixelate many things when I was growing up.  That was just called interference on the cable.  But if you squinted, you could kind of see stuff.  Yeah.  I love the way the paper point, like, this is this big deal. 
[00:11:30]  Sex side of gov spent 80,000 on call girls.  And then I'm like, that's a, that's a good year.  And then you look back and it's like over 10, over 10 years and they're calling him an  addict.  10 years.  And the fact that he was using like high profile or high, uh, cost, uh, call girls.  Come on.  Someone did some math.  Yeah.  Oh, you average that out.  This is why he's a, this, he's a good kid, but good kid.  You want to go back 10 years, $80,000 that averages $24 a day. 
[00:12:00]  Wow.  You could feed a family of six in Olivia.  That's the big addiction.  24 bucks a day.  24 bucks a day.  But you know what?  If he's nothing, you know, but let's do the real math.  I mean, they're, they, they're assuming 10 years, but probably 15 to 20.  And there's a lot more than $80,000.  There's a lot more.  Yeah.  He's a billionaire, right?  Who comes from a lot of money.  I heard he's a billionaire.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We're close to that.  Family.  Anyway, his family.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  The family.  I was on the East side of New York yesterday and I was walking, uh, home and I decided,  you know, where does this Elliot Spitzer guy live?  Pass by.  So I decided to pass by the, the media frenzy.  They're all outside his apartment on the East side there.  Did you, did everybody get quiet for a second so you could hear inside?  I don't think this guy cares that his whole freaking family's falling apart. 
[00:13:00]  I think you don't think he cares.  Nope.  I think this is going to free him up to, to just, uh, continue his lifestyle.  I think it's just going to free him up.  He's going to be relieved.  I think it's going to be relieved.  He doesn't have a career to worry about anymore.  So he's going to, it's going to be all about this.  His, uh, his career is done.  He knows it.  Do you think that's going through his head?  Like, do you think he's saying, uh, my career is done?  I really, my politics, my family life, everything's done. 
[00:13:30]  Um, I can get whores now whenever I want.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, anyway, so I, I, uh, walked by the media frenzy.  They're all outside, uh, Elliot Spitzer's place, all hoping that he's just going to leave,  you know, out the front door yesterday.  Like that was going to happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're waiting for him.  And, uh, I had, uh, I had a moment.  I was standing there and like, uh, this young guy walks by with his friends. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And he stops me.  I mean, he, he, he, he confronts me or whatever.  And he says, uh, Hey, is this where Elliot Spitzer lives?  I go, yeah, yeah.  He goes, that explains why all the prostitutes are here.  Prostitutes?  The media, man.  Oh, prostitutes.  Yeah.  They think we're just sick killer zombies.  I looked at the guy.  I just went, uh, shut up. 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  And then he walked off.  He goes, his friends, come on, we're out of here.  Oh God.  That explains why the, all the prostitutes are outside.  The prostitutes.  Man.  Shut up.  Look, I, I have no respect for the media in general.  And I know we are sort of part of the media.  No.  But that is such a, such a hack line. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  We get it.  You're all zombie killers.  Trying to be all, uh, profound, aren't you?  Yeah.  You know, we talked about Hillary yesterday.  I didn't even realize how stupid I was.  They, they, she didn't say anything about Spitzer because of her own dumb husband.  She couldn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't put two and two together at that moment.  Like she couldn't say anything.  Yeah.  It's a bad place for her to be.  You would think though she could say something, but yeah, her husband, uh, and of course Monica  Lewinsky, uh, her, her just standing there pretty much not knowing it. 
[00:15:30]  Dude, we, Ant and I were laughing so hard because the news is now doing the montage of all the  politicians that have gotten in trouble.  Oh God.  And all the evangelists and stuff.  They have a awesome montage.  They're running here in New York.  I'm sure they're running it on every TV, uh, station in America at this point.  But, uh, when they got to McGreevy, it was the best one because there, the way he said  it, he goes, he's standing there, his wife is next to him.  He's standing there at the podium and he just goes, I had consensual adult sex with another 
[00:16:00]  man.  And there was this gap, this like, and it's like consensual adult sex or adult consensual  sex.  Right.  And, and everyone's just like, all right, all right, let's see where this goes.  Maybe we'll, you know, he'll apologize to his wife and family.  And then when he goes to another man, it's just like, what?  What? 
[00:16:30]  And the, the wife is just there going, oh my God, I turned men to other men.  I think she was on TV last night.  Oh, she didn't stay too long with him because he got so femmy once he came out of the closet.  He went, oh, did he go fem?  He went into every toilet.  He went into a mode immediately.  Cause I guess he was trying to, you know, keep up a good front, uh, when he's married,  he's the governor.  Uh, but then when he said he was a gay American, was he ever, oh, did he fly out of the closet 
[00:17:00]  with a feather boa?  He pranced at it.  He was dancing out of the closet.  Oh yeah.  Well, his wife was on TV last night, uh, talking about why women stand by their, uh, their men  on, when this type of thing.  Why?  Yeah.  All right.  Take away all the legal questions.  The big question today, the Elliot Spitzer sex scandal.  Why?  Not why he did it, but why his wife would stand by his side. 
[00:17:30]  She was right there with him during that very public apology yesterday.  Same way my next guest was right there with her man as he came clean about a gay love affair.  He, of course, being the governor of New Jersey at the time, Jim McGreevey, his estranged wife  is with me right now.  Dina Matos McGreevey.  Was it deja vu for you, Dina?  Yes.  Um, you know, I watched that, um, report yesterday and, and I, my heart ached for, uh, Mrs.  Spitzer. 
[00:18:00]  It was, um, like reliving, uh, my ordeal, uh, you know, three and a half years ago.  That voice could turn you gay.  I'm sorry.  Horrendous.  I'm sorry.  I was ready to lunch for Jimmy just listening to that voice.  Nah.  Nah.  My heart goes out.  Nah.  Could you do a good read today for Quick Stop?  Nah.  Nah.  Quick check, please.  Can you imagine that awful goose voice trying to turn you on at night? 
[00:18:30]  Poor Jim.  He just wanted to doze off and, and wake up and go find another gentleman through a hole  in the bathroom.  Thinking of sugar plums dancing on his face.  And, and there it is.  Ah, Jim.  Jim.  Give it to me, Jim.  No.  Uh, she continues.  Elliot Spitzer's wife stood out there with him.  Time and again in these scandals, we see the spouse stand out there looking stoic as you  did.  Oh, look stoic? 
[00:19:00]  With, with the candidate.  Why?  Well, you know, I, I can't speak for her, but for me, I, I loved him.  I married him because I loved him.  And this was all.  You did something and you said, go to hell.  You've humiliated me.  No.  You've humiliated our daughter.  No, no, because I was in a state of shock.  Uh, it was only a couple of days after the, the resignation speech.  She felt sorry for him.  Yes.  Initially, I felt sorry for him.  Do you think Mrs. Spitzer felt sorry for her husband, even though it looks like he might  have had five years or better of dealing with this prostitution? 
[00:19:30]  She probably did.  And she, they're married over 20 years.  They have three daughters together.  And, you know, your feelings for someone don't evaporate overnight.  Oh, what the hell?  Well, a week or two, they sure do.  There is a lot of evaporation.  I think this situation is different, too, aside from the infidelity.  Right.  I think she can probably feel more sorry for McGreevy because he's just was this confused,  you know, trying to hide his sexuality like that. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And having to go out there and, and, and come out of the closet at the same time he's, he's  given a press conference on, on a scandal and everything.  Whereas Spitzer, it's pretty much just, hey, I like you.  I like getting some of this and you ain't it.  I like to get some of this young 20-year-old ass.  Yeah.  Who's feeling sorry for Spitzer?  And you ain't it.  All I have to do is look at the front page of the New York Post.  Jesus.  That's just ridiculous.  I think even half the women out there aren't feeling sorry for him. 
[00:20:30]  He got that.  You shouldn't have to design the show on that picture.  No.  You know what?  With that picture, it's like at least the guy, you know, the money went to a good cause.  He got that looking like that.  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing right there.  I don't even care about the money thing.  What he should do is kick his wife, Silda, out of that dumb apartment.  Silda?  And move this Sienna chick in and, and business as usual for the, for the state of New York.  There you go.  There should be the new first lady of New York. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Just a dumb blonde airhead walking around with him.  Just smelling good all the time.  Hugging all the politicians and now they got sparkles on.  He's got to roll over them.  He's got to run around the big fancy cotillions looking for her.  She's all drunk like Fredo's wife.  You want me to take care of this, Elliot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, because the rumor is he's going to resign today, but man, could you imagine he 
[00:21:30]  just, um, goes to a press conference with one of the, one of the, look, yeah.  And just, he lays it out.  Look, this is what I got for my money.  You understand, right?  Who's arguing guys, guys, please.  Any of you guys that don't appreciate where my money went, you stand up.  All right.  McGreevy sit down.  He squeezes her face like a horse.  Look at this mouth.  He starts like feeling her gums and her teeth. 
[00:22:00]  And then they got the approval rating on TV and there's, there's 30%, 30% of New Yorkers  think he's doing a good job.  They were talking that his approval rating was down to 30%.  That's 30% of people going, I, I kind of like what he's doing.  I kind of understand.  I don't mind.  And then there was 70% of the people that said he should resign.  So that 30, again, is going, no, leave him in.  Leave him in.  I want to see what he does next.  Leave him in.  Keeps it interesting, right?  Do 70% think he should, that's a little harsh. 
[00:22:30]  They should, you know, I could see 50%, but there's really that many guys that think he  should retire?  That is, uh.  I don't think it's harsh.  I think it should be a lot higher.  I mean, the fact that 30% think he shouldn't be, shouldn't resign is pretty, pretty interesting.  You know?  It's just, it's.  I want to know how many of those are women out of the 30%.  I bet you they asked 100 people, 70 women and 30 men, right?  There it is, Jimmy.  All right.  We got to take a break, but another, this is going to be a great show today. 
[00:23:00]  That's for sure.  We got your latest Elliot Spitzer bullet points here.  We also have a big FU going out to Meatloaf and the Manatees.  Yeah.  Ugh.  We'll get into both of those things after the break.  The Manatee.  Not much of a difference between Meatloaf and those two fatties.  Yuck.  Getting Crap Wrong once again up there in Boston.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on WBCN, the home of the River Rave. 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  The home of Toucher and Rich.  Mm-hmm.  But first, we got a little something-something.  Opie and Anthony.  Re-elect Governor Elliot Spitzer.  As governor, he proposed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in New York.  Hey, hey!  As a client of the Emperor's Club, he enjoyed the services of a petite brunette escort named Kristen,  who may or may not have electrocuted his b***h with a car battery.  Re-elect client number nine for governor.  Paid for by the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:24:00]  Thank you so much.  You folks are in a great mood, and I know why, because it's a beautiful day in New York City.  Isn't it lovely outside?  Beautiful blue skies.  It's sunny, very, very sunny.  It's so sunny and bright outside that earlier today, Elliot Spitzer came out of a brothel squinting.  That's right.  Well, I guess everybody knows about this by now.  New York Governor Elliot Spitzer caught with a high-priced call girl. 
[00:24:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, there, but for a declined MasterCard, go I.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the only thing people are talking about.  It is just amazing.  What a funny line led a bit ahead of that declined MasterCard.  Yeah, yeah.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Big F you going out to meet Love today. 
[00:25:00]  He blew us off.  He blew us off.  Yeah, but it's just like it was going between two PR firms, and Roland was dealing with them.  And they said it was confirmed.  And then they're like, no, we didn't say it was confirmed.  Meanwhile, we've had it down for today at 8 o'clock, and Roland said they absolutely confirmed it.  And we had copies, advanced copies of his movie.  Yeah.  So why do you give out advanced copies?  I don't know these people.  I'll tell you who the people are. 
[00:25:30]  One of them is from Murphy PR.  John Murphy from Murphy PR.  I don't know if he's right or wrong.  And there's a Marley Wilson from Vroom PR.  Maybe people have dealt with them, and they know.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  If any of you know either one of these guys and know if they're legit, maybe they are.  We're just sick of being lied to.  Tired of it.  It's just amazing.  People love lying to this program.  Oh, yeah.  The bottom line is, and then the answer is, well, he's not doing any press today.  Oh, really? 
[00:26:00]  So today was never an okay thing.  But he was doing press.  They asked us if we want meatloaf.  So what happened between us saying, yes, we want meatloaf, and today where he's not coming on the show?  He probably – see, the thing is, originally I didn't fault him.  I'm like, you know what?  It happens.  The artist doesn't always get the message.  But now I know the managers and stuff know that we have been promoting this and all that stuff,  and they're still douching us, and he's not coming on.  So that's why I feel comfortable attacking him as well because he could have come on, 
[00:26:30]  and he just doesn't want to.  He wants to probably stay in bed instead of coming on and promoting his completely average documentary.  Well, screw him.  This is not exactly Katrina you're covering.  Why is his documentary average?  That's wonderful because I didn't even bother watching it.  Why would you?  I don't know because it's about a man in his late 50s.  This is the whole thing.  It's about him on tour in 2007 because we've all wanted to know. 
[00:27:00]  What is meatloaf like on tour?  And it's about him because he does Paradise by the Dashboard Lights, and he acts it out.  Well, yeah.  He acts it out on stage with a much younger dancer – a singer – who's actually – she's a very good singer, in fairness to her.  Her name is Aspen.  How much money did that cost him?  Believe me, it had to be a lot.  $80,000 over the course of 10 years, I believe.  The critics brutalized him and how awful it looked, and she looked like a little kid, and he just looked gross. 
[00:27:30]  It's so funny just to watch this fat idiot falling apart at the seams, trying to act like the critic reviews don't bother him.  And then he's like – the big mystery is what's he going to do?  Is he going to fix it?  How is he going to fix it?  Because he has eight shows before they film the DVD.  Oh, no.  Now what does he do?  Eat?  I'll tell you what he does.  Here's the big – save yourself the money.  He decides to put on the wig like the old days and then make it like it's a retro. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  No, he doesn't.  Yeah.  So that's what this guy does.  He puts on a wig, and they all – the whole meatloaf band has to go out there in Halloween costumes and pretend it's the 70s.  And so he's kind of like reenacting the video.  You remember the famous video of him in the –  Oh, of course.  Who could forget?  Yeah, it was just a moment.  And then they reenact that.  And then there's one point where they can't do the kissing.  It's just too disgusting. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  He has to just put his arm around her.  They both have to stand there and look at the screen.  It's horrendous.  Oh, wow.  That's what your idea of compromising and making this palatable to critics is?  Maybe that's why he's not coming on the show today because the reviews are just getting really bad.  And he's embarrassed.  Well, that was the live show.  I don't even know what the reviews of the documentary are.  But he was a real dick to the guys who were filming him.  It was really – I had a bunch of questions for him.  I was so annoyed.  Yeah.  The questions –  I see a whole list of questions for meatloaf, Jimmy. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  What's on that sheet?  Well, I may have allowed it to annoy me a little bit, so forgive me.  Okay.  But I felt, why can't I ask my meatloaf questions?  Yeah.  I had 10 questions I was going to ask meatloaf, but I amended them slightly when my mood altered.  Oh, okay.  The original – one question was, was it uncomfortable being filmed?  You seem to have a terse relationship with the camera crew.  Okay.  I changed that a little bit.  Why were you such an incredible douche to the poor slob who drew the short straw and got stuck filming you? 
[00:29:30]  That might have been my bitterness creeping in.  I don't know.  Yeah.  The next question was, I was amazed at how hands-on you were with the stage production.  Has experience taught you that the only way to get things done is to pay close attention to every detail?  Oh, very nice.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  I kind of amended it, though.  What bothers you more, the fact that you're a monumentally charmless control freak or the fact that all your attention and focus adds up to mediocrity? 
[00:30:00]  And this is the thing.  This is kind of charming.  He goes on stage with a jersey of the local sports team.  Sure.  Yeah.  In every city you played, I noticed you wore the jersey of the local team.  You a big sports fan?  That was the question you was going to get.  And 3A would be, have you always resorted to such groveling, wormy tactics to win over an audience or just since you lost your voice? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, wow.  What a dick.  I love it.  It's just the original questions.  Jimmy calls me yesterday as I'm outside.  We're a weird show, man.  I'm outside Elliot Spitzer's apartment, part of the media frenzy, just taking it all in.  My phone's ringing.  It's Jimmy.  I'm like, hey, Jimmy, what's up?  He's like, we have to just beat the hell out of meatloaf tomorrow on our show.  I'm like, yeah, that's cool.  No, you don't understand.  I'm writing questions. 
[00:31:00]  I'm ready for this one.  I was so irritated.  It got one star by this in search of paradise.  That was generous.  Yeah.  And there's one scene where meatloaf is looking, because what he does is he's very ritualistic, as a lot of artists are.  Sure.  And he goes over the night before's performance, like on the CD, and he listens to it.  I guess that tells him what he did right and wrong.  You know, it's a whole thing with this.  Wow.  But apparently in the hotels, one of the maids accidentally threw out the CDs.  Oh, God.  Oh, well.  Talking about the tension building. 
[00:31:30]  So I wanted to say, in one of the hotels, the maids were cleaning your room and threw out a recording of the previous night's concert.  Wow.  Were you able to recover that CD at all?  Hmm.  Because I'd like to know.  A little mystery.  Nice.  A little mystery.  I may, again, maybe been in a scripted foray.  Did it ever occur to you that the maid who threw out the CD did so after listening to it for five minutes? 
[00:32:00]  Now, this is the problem with the concert, is that the acting out of Paradise by the Dashboard Lights, the critics were killing him for it.  And so I said, many critics felt like the acting out of Paradise by the Dashboard Lights was inappropriate due to the age difference between you and the girl.  Did you get any sense of that from the audience?  Which I think is a legit question.  Yes, of course.  Sure.  5A.  Your acted out rendition of Paradise by the Dashboard Lights was the most embarrassing, campy piece of garbage I've ever seen.  Not to mention, you look like a bloated suburban dad trying to recapture his youth while making one of his daughter's friends uncomfortable. 
[00:32:30]  The critics justifiably crucified you for this.  Comment?  Comment?  Jimmy, you've got to do more writing for the Opie and Anthony show.  This is wonderful.  And this is one I've always been curious about, number seven.  Now, I've heard that you got your name because your father called you meat as a derogatory reference to your weight, and years later, one of your coaches called you loaf.  Now, is that true, or have I been spending a little too much time around the rumor mill? 
[00:33:00]  You're like a joke question, kind of.  I felt like shortening that in my pithy mood.  Is it true that people call you meatloaf because you've only written three good songs since 1974?  I love it.  I felt that was just a little easy.  Yeah.  Just a couple more.  There's a montage of you complaining about all your...  Meatloaf, this is kind of charming.  He's got like a lot of ailments and things that drive him, you know, bad. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a montage of him complaining, so I wanted to ask him, there's a montage of you complaining about all your ailments.  Have you always been a bit of a hypochondriac?  I'm hoping that wouldn't be a bit much for him.  And then I amended that to, I always knew you were fat, but I never realized you were such a whiny jerk-off.  Does that tend to annoy everyone around you and cause them to hate your guts?  And two more for the meat.  I don't want to give it away, but to silence the critics, you came up with a pretty ingenious way to perform Paradise by the Dashboard Lights that would be comfortable for the critics and yet enjoyable for your audience. 
[00:34:00]  Did you find yourself getting more favorable reviews after that?  Nice, yeah, sure.  9A.  Since you apparently have the artistic integrity of a child pornographer, you allowed a few bad reviews to force you to change your douchey presentation of a song we're all tired of anyway.  So you made the band dress in 1970s clothes while you humiliated yourself by putting on a girl's wig and a tuxedo so you'd look less like a pederast and more like you were paying tribute to a 30-year-old music video. 
[00:34:30]  So, did this blind the critics to the awfulness of you acting out this song and garner you good reviews, or do they continue bashing you for not only being campy, but for being a sellout whore as well?  That was a little wordy, but effective.  But effective, yeah, but we get the point.  And the last one.  All right.  Number 10, a real sexy part of your stage show is when you get to kiss the lovely Aspen Miller.  She's the, uh, good girl.  Va-va-voom.  Despite the age difference, any sparks flying between you two? 
[00:35:00]  Oh, okay.  And, uh, how many times did Aspen Miller threaten to walk off the tour unless you doubled her salary?  And after one of your big kissing scenes, did you ever notice her backstage crying and scrubbing her mouth out with a toilet brush?  Just a few questions I'd like to ask the meat.  I wish he would have, uh...  Look at the picture!  Shown up.  Yeah, look at the picture of him...  Oh, my God!  ...in his, uh, in his dad jersey.  Look, dad going to the, uh, high school football game to root on his son. 
[00:35:30]  And, uh, dad is flirting with the cheerleader.  Yes, with that.  The underage cheerleader.  But that's stupid.  He looks like every radio sports guy.  Yeah.  And he's got to stand there and sing, and we were barely 17, and we were barely dressed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she looks 17.  Well, she's barely 17, and he's...  And he, uh...  He's barely holding on to the 50s.  Ooh.  Yeah, he's like 57 years old.  Is he 57?  Hey, we've got to get that picture up on onaradio.com, because it is downright creepy.  Hey, uh, John from Virginia writes, guys, try to find the audio meatloaf performing I'll 
[00:36:00]  Do Anything for Love on the Today Show.  It's horrendous.  And then Steven asks from Bayshore, what happened between...  The booking of meatloaf?  Hold on, I lost him.  Uh, what happened between booking meatloaf and today?  Three words.  Baby, diaper, mustache.  Really?  Nah, I think that, uh, he just probably wants to stay in bed and doesn't want to get up,  and his managers, uh, instead, they probably, I'm sure they know about what's happening and  the fact that he was promoted all day or for a week, and he's still douching us. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, again, it's the PR firm.  I gave you the names.  Maybe some of you know those people.  I'm, I don't know what happened.  Right.  But if any of you have dealt with them, uh, maybe you could ask them what's gone on.  I have no idea.  That is the creepiest picture.  Yeah, we'll get this up.  Yeah, looks like Tom Arnold.  Yeah.  It's like a big, fat Tom Arnold just singing with a girl who needs a gig.  She's really attractive, but watching them, like their little groping, it's like, he's  using it as an excuse, it looks like, just to kind of put his hands on a younger woman 
[00:37:00]  so his wife doesn't smash him in the face.  It's really uncomfortable to watch.  Who's singing back up for them?  Chris Hansen?  It should be.  It is really creepy, and one star is a gift.  Very good, Jimmy.  I mean, we were ready for the meatloaf interview today, too.  We had all sorts of production we did, and we're actually like, uh, like working on  this radio show again.  Are we?  It's quite terrific.  Yeah.  We should, um, because we do, uh, go into the production studio.  Yeah.  And we promote the guests.  Yes. 
[00:37:30]  That are going to show up, and a lot of times they haven't shown up.  Yeah.  So we should just start promoting huge stars.  Sure.  That won't show up.  That's a very good idea.  I mean, why not?  Hey, catch the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow when we have whoever.  I'm hearing.  Tomorrow we got Barack Obama.  All you have to do is say, I'm hearing.  I'm hearing.  Yeah, yeah.  Word, word is.  Word on the street.  Yeah.  Ugh!  Oh, my God!  They're kissing, Jimmy!  This is so bad. 
[00:38:00]  Look at the size of his head compared to her.  It looks like a wildebeest kissing a hot chick.  It's uncomfortable.  It is.  Why is Tim Sabian kissing that young girl?  Oh, no.  A little inside, but a few people out there are laughing.  It's just, it's uncomfortable.  If he had any, any, if he was an artist, he would have made it.  Because it is extraordinarily campy.  Yeah.  And you can't watch it without going, ugh.  Ugh.  He would have had like a big monster chasing him around and made it funny instead of vainly 
[00:38:30]  attempting to capture some sex appeal or some kind of relevance.  Yeah, of 30 years ago.  Ugh.  And for Meat Loaf, talking about this scene that we're grossed out by, we did a little  something with it for our big Meat Loaf interview today.  Here he comes.  Please play.  It's going to be close.  Here's the throw.  Here's the play of the plate.  Holy cow, I think he's going to make it.  Stop right there.  I got to know right now.  Before we go any further, do you love me? 
[00:39:00]  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me?  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?  Will you take me away  And will you make me alright  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me  Will you love me forever 
[00:39:30]  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  And I'll give you my answer  In the morning  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer  In the morning  Let me sleep on it  Baby, baby  Let me sleep on it 
[00:40:00]  Let me sleep on it  I'll give you my answer  In the morning  Ning  That's actually sexier  And less creepy  Than what you came in the morning  Will you love me forever  Do you need me  Will you never leave me  Will you make me so happy  For the rest of my life  Will you take me away  Will you make me your wife  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me  Will you love me forever  What's it gonna be, boy? 
[00:40:30]  Come on!  I can wait all night  What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?  What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  Let me sleep on it  Answer in the morning  I gotta know right now  Do you love me?  Will you love me forever?  Do you need me? 
[00:41:00]  Will you never leave me?  Will you make me so happy  For the rest of my life?  Will you take me away?  And will you make me your wife?  I gotta know right now  Before we go any further  Do you love me?  And will you love me forever?  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things  I've ever seen  Will you love me forever?  Will you sleep on it  Will you love me forever?  I couldn't take it any longer  Lord, I was crazed  And then the feeling came upon me  Like a tidal wave  I started swearing to my God 
[00:41:30]  And on my mother's grave  That I would love you  Till the end of time  I swore that I would love you  Till the end of time  So now I'm praying  For the end of time  Hurry up and arrive  Of course if I gotta  Spend another minute with you  I don't think I can really survive  I'll never break my promise  Or forget my vows  But God only knows  I can do it right now  Praying for the end of time  All I can do 
[00:42:00]  Praying for the end of time  I can end my time with you  It never felt so good  It's okay  It's okay  It's going far away  It never felt so good  It never felt so right  And we're all glowing  Like the metal on the edge of a knife  It never felt so good  It never felt so right  And we're all glowing  like the metal on the edge of a knife. 
[00:42:30]  It never felt so good, it never felt so right,  and we're all glowing like the metal  on the edge of a knife.  It never felt so good, it never felt so right,  and we're all glowing like the metal  on the edge of a knife.  What's better than it was today?  Alright, let me do it again.  Again?  What, did he think he was going to get a better take?  I don't know.  I love the enthusiasm of Closer to Kano.  He jumps right into his role.  Steve, though. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I like the metal on the edge of a knife.  We had him do another one.  This one's a lot shorter,  but you know that wolf thing?  That meatloaf, well, I forgot the name of the song,  but I guess he was trying to get another  Paradise by the Dashboard Light thing.  I think it took the words right out of my mouth.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we had the boys do the beginning of that.  This is a lot shorter.  On a hot summer night,  would you offer your throat to the wolf  with the red roses?  Will he offer me his mouth?  Yes.  Will he offer me his teeth? 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Will he offer me his jaw?  Yes.  Will he offer me his hunger?  Yes.  Again, will he offer me his hunger?  Yes.  And does he love me?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  On a hot summer night,  would you offer your throat to the wolf  with the red roses?  Yes.  I bet you say that to all the boys.  That's all you need.  God.  How awful is that? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it bugs me.  It's like we're just a business filled with liars.  Like, no one just bugs you straight up.  Liars.  The publicists are the worst.  The PR people are the worst.  Yeah.  They just, they can't be,  because what they are,  a lot of times,  they're kind of,  they're fringe players in the sense  that they're not talent.  Mm-hmm.  So they have to be a part of it somehow.  So they just kind of,  you know,  leech and bloodsuck from the out.  And they want the power,  I think,  that the actual celebrity has.  They want some kind of power  in dictating what they do, 
[00:44:30]  who they talk to.  So then they just,  you know,  lie.  Bits of liars.  It really is irritating.  Absolutely.  It really is irritating.  All right.  We're going to move on  to the next liar after the break.  Oh, more for the black people to attack?  The manatees from the bottom.  Oh, yeah.  Stupid manatees.  We'll get into that whole thing  after the break.  You're checking out  Opie and Anthony.  Elliot Spitzer.  Tough on crime.  Tougher on the coochie. 
[00:45:00]  Sir, now listen to this.  Spitzer was told about  the evidence against him  on Friday.  On Friday.  Last Friday.  And how about that?  I'm thinking,  wow, somebody had a worse weekend  than I did.  Friday, for the love of God.  But he was,  he was,  he went through this  call girl thing  where you get the call girls  and he was known,  a regular customer,  he was known as client nine.  Client nine.  And it looks now  like client nine  will soon be looking  for wife number two. 
[00:45:30]  He looks like.  That's what it is.  But, you know,  I'm a half full kind of guy.  I always try to put  a positive spin on stuff.  And sure,  it's a horrible story.  On the other hand,  you look at it this way,  he was supporting  New York's number one industry.  So that's good.  We always have to.  Letterman doing a great job  with this Elliot Spitzer thing.  We're back  with the Opie and Anthony shoot.  Hey.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  The phone's just lit once again. 
[00:46:00]  This is pretty much  the only thing  people are talking about.  This and how much  of a douche meatloaf is.  Yeah.  Don't miss that  riveting documentary.  What's going to happen  when he shoots the DVD  and he shows?  Well, look.  Oh, boy.  The tension.  You can handle tension.  I recommend that.  If you can.  Oh, if you have a weak heart,  stay home.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss  in studio today. 
[00:46:30]  What's going on?  How are you, Rich?  Pretty good.  I haven't seen you  since the great  diaper caper.  I saw it on,  I saw that they posted it  online on a different place  and I couldn't look at it  because I respect you too much  and it's just,  it's just,  I don't know.  Isn't it just creepy?  You know what?  And I got home  that night  and this is true,  Bonnie goes,  I told her the story.  She was like,  she goes,  change the baby's diaper.  I go, no.  She goes,  oh, you get all the fun 
[00:47:00]  with the crap stuff,  not me.  You know what I mean?  I can't even speak.  That was a very good  coherent story.  What is wrong with you?  I'm just,  I gotta get into it.  This is a national  radio show.  Oh, all of a sudden  this is the first time  I screwed up?  No, you're screwing up  a little more than usual.  You alright?  What happened was  I get all the glory  when it comes to crap,  she said.  Whatever.  You made a career out of it.  By the way,  this is our dumb voices. 
[00:47:30]  We both hosted  for Comedy Central  a show called  Live at Gotham.  I did one night,  Richard did another night.  A bunch of comics did it.  And they have  a teleprompter.  And the words  were a little,  and Voss was worried  about reading  the teleprompter.  Do you think  I forgot this?  Oh, no.  And he says to me,  because he was worried  about pronouncing words,  he goes,  do they at least  have it in hieroglyphics?  No, he didn't.  He did?  And I'm like,  what did you just say?  And he goes,  hieroglyphics.  And then what else  did you say?  There was one more  word you used.  I forget the word 
[00:48:00]  you used,  but of course  it was wrong.  Phonetically.  He wanted to.  Of course he wanted  to say phonetically.  Hieroglyphics.  Poor Rich.  Egyptian symbols  going by  on a teleprompter.  You know,  sometimes you're  not thinking.  Sometimes.  I'm surprised  when you eat,  you don't just  put food in your ear.  That's how  monumentally stupid  that was.  You were like  a hero on Friday  and you're back  to being,  come on,  I've only been in  for 30 seconds.  I was up all night 
[00:48:30]  watching that.  You know what?  How about you go  to bed early  if you're going to  have an appearance  on the Opie and Anthony  show?  We started watching  this dumb movie.  Sean Penn owes me  two hours for this  horrible movie.  What movie?  Into the Wild.  Right.  So here's the thing.  Completely disagree.  Loved Into the Wild.  Yep.  It wasn't that bad.  What do you need?  A lot of words?  It was cool to just  kind of hang  and watch this  whole thing  kind of developing  and watch this guy  trying to find himself  and walking around  the wilderness  and trying to survive. 
[00:49:00]  I guess because he  rolled around  in his own crap  you related to him.  Come on,  that wasn't that bad stupid.  Baby diaper mustache  is doing quite well  on YouTube,  by the way.  It was the funniest thing.  And Rich set me up  nice with E-Rock  bringing in that diaper  and I did a little mustache  with God,  now you got something  on me.  Now I'm ready to go  I'm in a good mood.  I can't wait to see  your daughter  when she understands  stuff and starts speaking  where you can point at me  and go,  he wore your...  As a mustache. 
[00:49:30]  As a mustache.  Thank you, yes.  Wow, I thought  we were going to do  a few more minutes  on baby diaper mustache  but you have nothing today.  I do.  I don't just come out  from the gate.  Sometimes I come out strong.  Sometimes I build.  I was at the doctor yesterday  so I got a lot  on my mind again.  I got to put a telescope  through my...  A what?  Oh no,  they got a snake...  Front or back?  What's that?  Front or back?  The front.  What are they looking for?  Kidneys or...  Huh?  What are they looking at?  The bladder this time. 
[00:50:00]  The kidneys are...  You know,  we already talked about that.  I've been through so many...  They send you  from one to another.  It's like a nightmare  from digestive system  to kidney to...  That's so everybody  gets a piece  of the insurance pie.  I'm sure...  I think it's unbelievable.  It's a big scam.  Is it?  Yeah,  because all the doctors  recommend you  to other doctors,  I guess,  and then they...  Yeah,  so they all get  a little cut of the insurance.  Uh-huh.  That's why you pay  ridiculous insurance premiums.  It's crazy.  Fix that. 
[00:50:30]  Fix that part of it,  Obama,  or stupid Hillary,  if you want to be president.  How about fixing  that part of health care  and health insurance  instead of just  trying to tax everyone  that might be making a living  and paying health care  for people that can't afford it?  How about you just  make it affordable  to everybody  by fixing that mess?  It's a big scam  between the doctors  and the insurance companies  and the pharmacies,  the pharmaceutical companies.  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  Back to Elliot Spitzer. 
[00:51:00]  This thing is getting terrific.  Sex with Elliot Spitzer.  Yeah.  I guess he's going to resign today?  Well, maybe not today.  He's supposed to,  but they were saying that  yesterday also.  He's apparently using  this resigning thing  as a defense  against criminal prosecution  for money laundering.  They want him  on money laundering charges  because he's been  taking this money  and kind of  running it  through a little wash  so people are a little 
[00:51:30]  thrown off  as to where it ended up,  which is in,  you know,  hookers' brassieres.  Right.  So he's going to use it  as a bargaining chip  so he doesn't do jail time?  Yeah, yeah.  So he's going to plea.  But how can you use  resigning as a bargaining chip  at this point?  Because it's so obvious  he has to step down.  You have to do it anyway.  And he should have  stepped down already.  Yeah.  Supposedly,  one of the news organizations  are saying he wanted  to resign last night  at 7,  Monday night at 7 p.m.  Yeah.  But his lawyers  got involved and said,  no, no, no, no.  We could use this 
[00:52:00]  for good.  It would be like  you're at your job.  You're caught stealing  from your job.  And they call the police  and you go,  look, okay,  here's the deal.  Um, I'll leave the job  if you don't, uh,  arrest me.  It's like, no, look,  we're firing you, idiot.  You're out.  You stole.  You are leaving the job.  Yeah.  As soon as you hit the sidewalk,  they're going to cuff you.  They're going to arrest you.  That's pretty much it.  There's no bargaining here.  Yeah, you can't bargain  with something  that you don't have  to bargain with. 
[00:52:30]  He's bargaining,  using his job to bargain.  His job is over.  He's done.  You know what?  They send, uh, uh,  the track star to abroad  for steroids to prison.  But, you know,  this is 10 times worse.  Is it?  In steroids?  I mean, what's the big deal?  Some track star  or whatever her name is.  If he was using  taxpayer dollars,  I think that would be bad.  What I'm saying is,  you know,  join her curses you or whatever.  Yeah, they send her to prison  for a year  for just taking steroids.  No, for lying.  Right, under oath.  Under oath.  Uh, you know,  and he's got money laundering, 
[00:53:00]  uh, fraud,  interstate,  uh, prostitution.  You know,  I mean,  it's a lot worse.  Yeah, here's the...  I'm sorry,  what's going on  with the Detroit mayor  who's got a sex scandal too?  I mean,  there's another big politician.  Really?  Uh, I heard the Detroit mayor  used the N-word too.  And I thought they buried  the N-word in Detroit.  They did.  They made a whole big, uh,  to-do about it.  Yeah, what's the sex scandal?  To-do.  Let's find out  about the Detroit mayor too.  Yeah, let's get that going on too.  Uh, here's the headlines  for Spitzer, uh,  just to get everyone up to date.  Spitzer has been using hookers 
[00:53:30]  for at least 10 years.  Uh, traveled as far as Florida  to meet up with girls.  May have had seven previous dates  with this girl, Kristen.  Wow, she must have been a good egg.  May have spent up to 80,000  on prostitutes.  That number's gotta be a lot higher.  That's because that's really nothing.  That's gotta be a lot higher.  Over 10 years?  It's nothing.  Yeah.  22-year-old girl  says Spitzer paid her for sex  two years ago  when he was a big tipper.  And that girl's on the front page  of the Post today.  Yeah, that's the, uh, Post girl.  The front page of the Post.  She should be on, uh, 
[00:54:00]  that page where they put the  hot girl.  Right, right.  Look at that girl.  Look at that, Rich.  Huh?  That's what he was paying for.  Exactly.  Wow.  That's what we gotta do today, Ant.  Every, every guy that comes  into the studio,  just show that picture to them.  Show on the page.  I'm gonna leave it.  And get the natural reaction.  And then you got,  even with the deal,  he could still face many charges  that carry jail time,  including some of the ones  we discussed.  Tax evasion,  money laundering,  and bringing a prostitute  across, uh, state lines.  So, so he's, uh,  in a bit of, uh,  a bit of trouble. 
[00:54:30]  Prostitutes across, uh,  state lines is a bad thing, huh?  That's a man act,  I guess they call it.  That's a man act.  Driving through people's backyards.  Taking Amtrak local stops.  But he didn't bring her, though.  He didn't bring her.  They said,  I bet you they won't get him on that.  They, uh,  because what if she was already  there in D.C.?  Yeah, she took a train.  She got him on wiretap.  And Joe knows why  she took a train.  Uh, Joe in New York,  what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Quick, one quick question first. 
[00:55:00]  I always hear you guys  talk about Huntington.  Do you guys ever go  to the Lion's Cage  way back when?  Of course.  Okay, good.  Wait, where's the Lion's Cage again?  That's the name  I haven't thought of.  We're going to Huntington  across from Burger King.  New York Avenue.  We're going so local.  Yeah, oh, yes, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's like a,  like a workout place  or something.  All right, that's way too local.  I think it's become  a gay bar or some shit since then.  Well, thanks for the cursing.  Or some stuff.  Thanks for the cursing.  Thanks for going so local 
[00:55:30]  that probably 99.9%  of our audience  decided to go somewhere else  for a few minutes.  Well, we'll get him right back.  What do you got, Joe?  Well, Joseph,  we'll get him right back.  The reason she went on a train  and not the plane,  and this is from somebody  who supposedly knows,  is she couldn't get through  a metal detector  taking the plane  because she had a shit up.  I'm sorry.  She had a bunch of dog collars,  chains, handcuffs,  all that stuff.  Are you out of your mind?  Look, man.  First of all,  he's a bad caller.  He doesn't understand  the rules. 
[00:56:00]  Secondly,  he,  what is he talking about?  She's got dog collars  on her and stuff.  Yeah.  And here's...  Look at the metal detector.  What?  Is she wearing them?  Why couldn't I follow him?  I wish that call  came right before me.  What a joke.  Also,  if you get to go local,  you got to make it  so interesting  because most people  will just turn off the radio.  You can't say,  remember the lion's den?  And you go,  yeah,  now you're expecting  some cool story.  And he goes,  yeah,  that place was awesome.  Yeah,  that rocks.  It is great.  Well,  the thing is,  it's like,  that's one of those,  that's already an urban, 
[00:56:30]  even if he did have whips,  she could just put it  in her luggage.  Right.  You don't carry him on  and throw him at the cockpit  as the plane's taking off.  You could just put him  in your luggage.  She didn't take the plane  to D.C.  because with airport traffic  and delays,  she could have been late.  This is a big gig.  A train is fast  and direct  and it's three hours,  three and a half hours,  you know you're there.  Plus...  Why send her to the airport?  Plus,  it's easier to hide  if you're taking a train.  Much easier.  And she feels more comfortable  doing a train.  Yeah,  you don't have a big paper trail  with a train 
[00:57:00]  as much as you do.  And that's probably  the real reason  why she took the train.  You know,  it would be so easy  to get all sorts of info  about this girl  if she took a flight  to Washington.  We've gone to D.C.  Do we never take a plane?  We always take the train  to the same plane.  Yeah.  It's easy.  Let's say hi to Robin  in Detroit.  He might know about  the mayor's story  in Detroit.  What's up, Robin?  Hi, hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Robin.  Yeah,  our mayor had two guys  in the police force  investigating him  for some different things  and he had them fired.  And so when the policeman  brought a wrongful 
[00:57:30]  termination suit  against him,  went to court,  they had his text messages  from the phone company.  He was having an affair  with his little assistant  and they lied about that  on the stand.  They lied that they  all got together  to get these guys fired.  cost the city $9 million.  Wow.  So,  so was the mayor  actually having  some kind of affair?  Oh, yeah.  They have the text messages  about meet me in this room,  blah, blah, blah,  do this, do that.  They had it all 
[00:58:00]  on the text messages.  Now, why did they  subpoena the text messages?  Was it about proving  these cops were fired wrongly?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  They made you happen  to find that.  Oh, that's a bad one.  That's good.  You douche two cops  and then your life  gets wrecked.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  That's what you get.  He's a dirty birdie.  There you go.  Thank you.  Let's go to  another dirty birdie.  Let's go to Dan in New York.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, um,  he definitely can use  that resignation,  I think,  as advantage.  He says he's a sex addict  and he couldn't 
[00:58:30]  control himself.  I was fired years,  I was caught stealing  at a job years ago  and I used that  because I was addicted  to drugs  and they said  that legally helping me,  they had to let me resign  and no charges.  I wonder,  you know what,  I thought of that too,  the sex addict angle.  Which is gonna come out.  Is it possible  if he gives,  because again,  these were adult  prostitute women,  there's nothing  that he was doing  that people can't comprehend.  It wasn't kids,  it wasn't,  it was,  is there a way for him, 
[00:59:00]  I mean,  maybe there's not,  but to admit,  look,  I screwed up,  I was sick,  I love my,  is there a way for him  to survive this?  No.  No.  No,  because,  what part of this?  They'll just pile on.  His current size governor.  Oh,  no way.  They'll just pile on  with the money laundering stuff,  being secretive about it.  You can't have a mayor,  I mean a mayor,  a governor,  that's seeing prostitutes.  He was,  he was prosecuting, 
[00:59:30]  yeah,  as he's prosecuting prostitutes.  Yeah,  that came out today,  as he's prosecuting  prostitution rings,  he's,  he's seeing prostitutes.  High class call girls.  You think when he's in prison,  like,  when the other cellmates  go meet him,  he gets dressed up  because they're going  to the governor's cell  that night?  He's not going to jail.  No,  he's not going to jail.  His life's ruined though.  This is pretty interesting.  Listen to this.  Well,  one of our sources  who's been spending time  up in the eighth floor  apartment here  says it's been largely silent, 
[01:00:00]  not much conversation  at all  between the governor  and his wife.  And in fact,  between the governor  and his daughters even.  Instead,  he's been spending  a lot of time  in an office  up in the apartment suite  talking extensively  with his closest advisors,  some of whom have said  he will resign  as early as this morning.  talking to his closest advisors  on Craigslist.  And this is,  he's in his office  by himself.  Would you leave 
[01:00:30]  this guy alone  at this point  if you were his wife?  But these are people  that are up there.  Where'd they get  that information from?  It's,  you can just say  whatever you want.  Are they listening  through walls?  You can say  whatever you want  because Eli Spitzer's  not going to come out  and go,  hey,  that's absolutely false  what you just reported.  Hey,  you're a liar.  We all have  an inner circle,  right?  Could you imagine  your inner circle,  they're with you  in a time of need  and then they're  running downstairs  to tell the reporters  that's such a crack of crap.  They could be listening 
[01:01:00]  through the walls  with like stethoscopes.  Or looking from  across the window.  Yeah.  Using one of those  laser things on the window  so they could listen  to what's going on inside.  Or they get a lip reader.  Or a lip reader.  Or it's the delivery guy.  He comes by with  some Chinese food.  And Elliot Spitzer  opens the door  and all of a sudden  it's all quiet.  Yeah.  Because they don't want  to air their dirty laundry  in front of the delivery guy.  And then as soon as  they pay for the food  and that door closes  it's back.  It was really quiet. 
[01:01:30]  No,  I think he is in  a living hell  being in there  with his wife  and three daughters.  Where can he go?  He can't even go to the...  He's got to sit  in his office  Can you imagine  just kind of  going to the fridge?  Oh.  You won't find  a whore in there.  I'm just trying to eat.  Oh,  eat what?  How much is that  going to cost you?  You have to tip  more for that?  Can I just  get something to drink? 
[01:02:00]  I would just  pack my bag  and just walk out  the front door.  Everything he does  is just being scrutinized.  I would hail a cab  and I would never  be seen again  and just let someone  else clean up the mess.  Never resign.  Nothing.  You know,  where enough time  goes by  and they have to  declare that he's  not governor anymore.  Like,  well,  I guess he's just  not the governor anymore.  We have to  get someone else in there.  She's online  just ordering stuff.  Yeah, Elliot.  No,  I'm just ordering  a few things.  About $80,000 worth. 
[01:02:30]  I figure  it's owed.  Oh,  could you just leave?  I'm just,  I write.  Screwed up.  Let's say hi  to Daryl  in Michigan.  Where are you,  Daryl?  I'm Lansing.  All right.  What do you got?  Hey,  regarding him  prosecuting  prostitution rings  and then going  to see prostitutes,  yeah,  average Joe  says,  that's the pot  calling the kettle black.  That's regular Joe, 
[01:03:00]  not average Joe,  sir.  Regular Joe.  You're wrecking  Jim Norton's  new character,  average Joe.  Regular Joe?  You're calling him  average Joe,  yeah.  You know,  what do I know?  I'm just,  I'm a working stiff.  There he is.  He's just regular Joe.  I don't know nothing.  Let the big muckety-mucks,  let them work it out.  They'll sort it out.  Six to one,  have a dozen other.  There you go.  Who am I to say?  What do I know?  New details show  a long-standing pattern  of prostitution  used by Elliot Spitzer  that could have 
[01:03:30]  long-term  and dangerous  consequences.  A number of investigators  close to the case  say Spitzer  was a repeat client,  spending some  $80,000  on escorts  from that service alone.  And other  law enforcement sources  say Spitzer  has been using  prostitutes  for as long  as 10 years,  including  while he was  New York  Attorney General.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  just bad.  The other day  when this came out  unconfirmed 
[01:04:00]  on the internet  before it hit the news,  you could just  see it build  within like  three hours,  it just exploded.  Did you see  the headline  on the internet  where it said  just they're  investigating  Governor Spitzer  and then  within three hours  every news station  was outside  his house.  Well,  that's how things  work these days.  Yeah,  not on this scale,  but we kind of  know how that works.  It's not fun at all.  Hey,  maybe this story  will die.  That's right,  maybe.  Oh,  right,  it's not  going to die.  It's going to blow up. 
[01:04:30]  What website  did you see it on?  MSN  on the front page.  Yeah,  that's not a news  website.  What is it?  Microsoft Network.  Yeah,  it's the news.  MSN.  Is it?  No,  you said  it started  on the internet  and then  the news  picked it up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  MSN  is kind  of a big  place  to go 
[01:05:00]  to find  out what's  going on  in the world.  I thought  it was going  to blow over,  I'm not going  to lie.  I thought  it was some  weird website  that had  nothing to do  with the news,  but it's going  to blow over.  MSN,  look,  we're on the  front page  of MSN.  I got to tell  you,  it's nothing  but news  stories,  Rich.  Let me tell you  something.  Ten years ago,  he was 39  years old.  You're telling  me,  I'm 39  now.  I'm 20  years into  hookers.  You don't  start getting 
[01:05:30]  hookers when  you're 39.  At 39,  you know,  you got a  point there.  The guys  probably,  and you  know,  I don't  know,  but I  would assume  based on  what Jimmy  just said,  I may have  been having  prostitutes  for quite a  while.  Oh,  yeah,  long,  long time.  Let's go  to Jared  in Boston  listening on  BCN.  River Rave  coming to  BCN  very soon.  We'll have  more details,  I'm sure.  Yes,  Jared.  Hello.  Some of you guys  I don't think you've  covered is that  there's no way he 
[01:06:00]  can survive.  The New York  legislature is  threatening impeachment.  Yep.  Not only are they  threatening impeachment,  they will start  those procedures if he  doesn't resign  immediately.  They're really pissed  that he hasn't  resigned yet.  In private,  the Democrats  want him to  resign as well,  but they can't  be on TV  like,  ah.  Yeah,  hey,  get rid of  this guy,  or we'll  impeach him.  But everyone  wants him  gone.  You know  why they  say no  business is  being done?  I do,  I do.  Thank you,  sir.  The taxpayers  are paying, 
[01:06:30]  and nothing's  getting done  right now,  because it's  just in limbo  until he  leaves,  and we get  the blind  black guy  in there  to stumble  into the  job,  I guess.  Yeah.  Well,  ain't that  just the  way it  goes?  Hey,  it's regular  Joe saying  it's just  the way it  goes.  I like  your commentary.  Yeah.  Give me a  container of  coffee.  You know,  you're just  a meat and  potatoes kind  of guy. 
[01:07:00]  That's all  I am.  That's what  it is.  Regular  Joe.  Yeah.  Mike  Crawford  hates  regular  Joe.  Who  would like  regular  Joe?  I want  regular  Joe  dead.  And we're  going to  bed last  night.  Do you  remember my  birthday a  couple years  ago?  They gave  me that  little thing.  It's like a  long stick  with a little  head on it.  And I was  shaking it with  little bells on  it.  It was one  in the morning.  I was exhausted  and she did  the nighty  night dance  and I wanted  to kick her  through my  window.  It was awful.  What's the  nighty night  dance?  It's where she  goes back and  forth shaking  that thing 
[01:07:30]  going.  It's nighty  night time  and I hated  her for it.  Oh my  God, how  does she  still live?  I don't  know.  That's what I  live with.  You should  have killed  her.  Regular Joe  and nighty  night time  and you  wonder why  we're going  to couples  therapy.  After the  break we  got to talk  about the  fact that  one in  14 girls  are infected  with an  STD.  One in  14?  One in  four.  One in  four?  Well I said  teen after  that so that's  where you got  confused.  One in  four teens?  Four teen 
[01:08:00]  girls infected  with an  STD.  Oh, that's  unbelievable.  But that  report is not  true because  yesterday it  was Afro  American they  said and  they took  that out  of that  report.  Afro  American.  Wait, what's  not true?  Well no, right  here it's  misleading.  So you think  white girls  it's okay?  I didn't say  also when I  heard this  story come  out, it  came out  on this  website.  It said  one in  four Afro  American  girls.  It's  African  American by  the way.  If you  want to be  politically  correct.  Afro 
[01:08:30]  American is  like from  1970.  And how  old am I?  And it  lasted.  True, you  were 30  that year.  So if we  have somebody  old to come  in, they  could say  colored.  And then  we'll get  some real  old, old  guy.  You're  trying to  bring that  back?  Yeah, I'm  just old  school.  Bring a  real old, old  guy and he'll  talk like we  do when the  mics are off.  Let's go  to Steve in  New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hey,  boss.  Oh no.  What?  Yeah.  Why don't  you just go 
[01:09:00]  home because  you're offering  nothing.  Well, you  know what?  Am I  supposed to  just completely  kill every  time for the  second I come  in and come  out?  When you go  to work, do  you perform  every day at  100%?  No, I sleep  at my desk.  Okay, so there  you have it.  And you get  paid for it,  don't you?  Well, they know  what to expect.  Yeah, but  basically what  Steve is saying,  see the type of  job we have, we  can't just like  sleep at our  desk.  We have to  be on at  all times.  Yeah, I  know, but  here's the 
[01:09:30]  thing, you  throw in a  couple good  lines here and  there and  you know, it  builds.  Yeah, there  you go.  Let's go to  Patrick on  Long Island.  Patrick, what's  up?  La la la la la la  la.  Good morning,  Opie.  Jesus.  I just wanted  to say that  Opie got  outsmarted by a  guy who doesn't  know that MSN is  a news site.  Yeah, of course  I know it's a  news site.  No, you said  you saw it on  some website  before the  news.  stations picked  up on it and  then you watched  how everyone 
[01:10:00]  picked up on it.  Everyone is so  particular around  here.  Well, it's not  even particular.  Let's go to  Terry in Montana.  Terry.  Hey, what's up  boys?  Hey.  I have never  seen anybody go  from hero to  ass so quickly on  this stinking  show.  You're talking  about Rich Voss,  of course.  I'm talking about  Rich Voss.  I've been on  for two.  Shut up,  stupid.  I've been on  for 20 minutes.  What am I  supposed to do?  Back flips?  Calm down.  I just drove in.  I slept two hours.  Shut your stupid  face.  20 minutes too  long, first of 
[01:10:30]  all.  Second of all,  why are you  sleeping two hours  before your big  appearance on the  Open Anxion show?  You're taking  advantage of us,  sir.  No.  You should get a  good night's sleep,  take your vitamins,  and get all prepared  for this fine  national radio show.  I'm prepared.  I took you a hookster.  All right.  Shut up.  All right.  I turn it around.  I start off slow  and I build  sometimes.  Oh, my God.  I'm done.  They're really  pissing me off.  Hello there, man.  All right.  We're going to  take a break.  Listen, Rich Voss  didn't bring in 
[01:11:00]  the diaper on Friday.  I've done it.  That led to  baby diaper mustache.  The video's up  on YouTube.  We're going to go  down memory lane  and just play  the clip  where we get  this done, okay?  Poor Richie  can't win for losing.  It's regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  Check out the video  on YouTube.  It's pretty much  the only place  that the video  is being viewed  at this point.  Our own radio station  here in New York  refuses to freaking 
[01:11:30]  post a video.  I'm going to play  this video  at the Stress Factory  this weekend.  That's why I'm going to play it.  Oh, that's where  you're going to be, Rich?  Okay.  We go to break  with this.  Baby diaper mustache  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Once again,  this is called  baby diaper mustache.  All the crazy stuff  he was...  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  Oh!  One, two, three, dude.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P. 
[01:12:00]  O.P.  Wipe that right under his nose.  He took two fingers, wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, no, no, he's got the diaper in his hand.  Where is he?  He's going home.  All right, he's running off to the bathroom.  Holy s***.  I don't know about you, but when I heard about the scandal, 
[01:13:00]  here's the first thing I thought.  I said, whoa, boy, well, there's another success for eHarmony.com.  That's what I said.  That's what I said.  They're talking about impeaching Elliot Spencer if he doesn't step down.  And I'm thinking, whoa, a Democrat being impeached for extramarital sex.  Happy days are here again.  Oh, my God.  Let's go.  Yo, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[01:13:30]  Got Rich Voss in the house today.  He's going to be at the Stress Factory all weekend long.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy here this morning.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He's good for a few every day.  He writes, bring the diaper back.  It contributed more to the show than Voss did.  Oh, Rich.  Well, you know, first of all, I just want to say, sorry, I'm late,  but that guy that does the impression of me that came in earlier.  I already did okay.  All right.  All right.  What do they want from me?  Jesus.  Everything.  So critical around here.  A laugh.  It's so hard.  What? 
[01:14:00]  Bill Wedgie from Connecticut writes,  does Opie mean one in four girls have a STD?  D.  Linger longer.  Beep, beep.  And then Gut Shot Drew from Howell.  He writes, I love the story of how they're saying that Spitzer's wife  needs to be tested immediately for STDs.  Oh, wow.  What kind of small talk will be going on during that exam?  Yes, she does need to be tested for the STDs  because we learned what that thing was yesterday,  that it was, in fact, sex without a condom. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Remember that came up yesterday?  There was some kind of unsafe practice or unsafe?  Something that was a little dangerous, I think.  Dangerous, sure.  Yeah.  He really wanted it without the condom.  And even with condoms, I mean, it stops AIDS and all that stuff,  but warts and herpes are both transferable even with condoms.  Crabs.  Well, crabs she would know, though.  Yeah, she certainly would.  And that stupid stiff wig hairdo of hers,  if there was a crab nest happening,  she'd probably feel it crawling around somewhere in that awful. 
[01:15:00]  And, you know, there's probably not much grooming going on with her.  Not much grooming.  It's all natural.  Not since kid three.  Yeah.  She does it with a weed whacker.  The warts are good, though,  because they're like having built-in ticklers on you.  I'm just sorry I didn't have the volume up for the Pound Talk people  to hear that gem.  Oh, regular Joe has one.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks for sharing.  You think we're all zombie killers? 
[01:15:30]  TMI.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  Meh.  Yeah.  We got to address something that's in the Boston Herald today.  We're not going anywhere.  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  On CNN, there's a near miss.  Yeah.  Look at that.  This guy goes through a busy intersection.  You've never seen anybody almost have ten accidents.  Wow.  Wait, where is he?  He's the love watch. 
[01:16:00]  Seattle.  Oh, how did he miss that?  Oh, my God.  How did he miss?  Did he hit the guy at all or no?  He might have clipped the white car.  Oh, my God.  That's him a little bit.  Just a little bit.  That could have really been a disaster, though.  Wow.  Wow.  That should have been a massive.  Blackstone Cops film video.  We'll get that video up on onaradio.com later this morning.  Here we go.  So we got to address something that's in the Boston Herald today.  Basically, for everybody listening on WBCN, we're going nowhere. 
[01:16:30]  We're staying in mornings for the foreseeable future, okay?  The dopey manatees, these fat pigs that write the gossip column for the Boston Herald,  the inside track, they're just two messes.  Disasters.  They think they're in the know.  They start rumors about us all the time.  This is another one that's hitting their dumb inside track today.  I think they used to like us until we kind of started pointing out the fact that they're 
[01:17:00]  phony fatties.  And then the hatred.  Yeah.  Well, honestly, most celebrities, most entertainers in the Boston area just hate these two.  Yeah.  They're phonies.  They go to like these restaurants and the clubs and these press junkets and they hide in the  corner, in the shadows, and they jot things down, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot.  They think they're in the know and they're completely wrong most of the time.  But just like any gossip column, you can write whatever you want because it's just the hearsay. 
[01:17:30]  It's rumors.  It's like we hear that.  Yeah.  All you have to say is we're hearing and there's no accountability because they don't have  to name their sources or anything.  And they're not the news.  It's a different thing if it's somebody breaking real news.  This is entertainment stuff.  Right.  So they get a lot of leeway.  Well, we lost our affiliate in Providence because they're going to an oldies format.  And I guess Scott Zolak, I didn't even know he was doing a radio show, got kicked off of 
[01:18:00]  this station and now they're trying to figure out where he's going to end up.  And the manatees write this.  Another scenario being bandied about has BCN tanking morning morons, Opie and Anthony.  Morning morons.  Both have M's in them.  Yeah, I like that.  Good writing.  Morning morons.  Very clever, funny writing.  Yeah.  And they don't use tanking. 
[01:18:30]  It makes it sound like tanking as far as our ratings go.  That's not it.  Tanking meaning just firing us.  Yeah.  Another scenario being bandied about has BCN tanking morning morons, Opie and Anthony.  Not to mention most of its rock format.  Moving afternoon men, Toucher and Rich, into the morning slot.  By the way, Toucher and Rich could do a great job in morning.  Do you think that alcoholic is going to be able to get up?  Morning started at 2.15. 
[01:19:00]  Unshaven disaster.  We've seen them at work.  My God.  He wears slippers to a radio station.  A Hawaiian shirt.  Unshaven with slippers.  That's how he does his afternoon drive show.  All kidding aside, the guys could do a great job in mornings.  They back up a tanker full of Bloody Marys every morning.  What does bandied about mean?  Can we look that up here, Rob?  Oh, it's just bandied about.  Bandied about.  That means, you know, it's being considered, Jimmy.  People are talking behind closed doors. 
[01:19:30]  A little rip-artee.  Sure.  A little tetch-tetch-tetch.  Let's see.  Not to mention most of its rock format.  So these fat dopes are saying that BCN is going away from rock as well.  Just not true.  They're promoting the river rave.  I mean, they're very excited about the rock that's happening in Boston.  And then they're bringing back the river rave for the first time in, what, four or five years?  Something like that?  You got STP.  You got filter.  STP. 
[01:20:00]  A little band.  Who?  STP.  I said STP.  I like the psyched STP better.  Right.  And then I guess Zolak would go into afternoon drive at BCN.  This is being.  What planet is he from?  Zolak?  Yeah.  What planet is Zolak from?  Zolak.  Zolak.  The planet of bad radio.  I am Zolak.  I am Zolak.  Ah. 
[01:20:30]  And then I haven't specifically heard that, says Gresh.  I guess Gresh would do the show with Zolak.  Gresh and Zolak?  Gresh and Zo.  Wow.  Their show's called Gresh and Zo.  Sounds like a fun listen.  BCN's been great to Zo and me and Gary Tangway during the Patriots season, but to tank Opie  and Anthony, that's a bigger decision that would come down from New York, but my ears  are open.  As always, do stay tuned.  Heheheheh, heheheheh, heeheh, heeheh, heeheh, heeeh, heeheh.  I hate these two. 
[01:21:00]  Go eat.  What are their names?  Look, why don't you just write an article about how you just don't like us and you're  going to try starting rumors about us whenever you can.  I mean, we can't play all our cards here, but I can tell you this much.  We're not going anywhere anytime soon.  You dopes.  You fat dopes.  what is it's gaily one of their names is gaily gaily fee gaily fee that's her name yeah yeah 
[01:21:30]  and laura riposa yeah gaily and i know why they don't like us by the way because back in the day  when we were at af one of these pigs actually hit on me and an appearance and i openly laughed at  her like she was saying how i was cute and stuff i'm like just go away it's glasses too  but one of these pigs and she knows who she is i don't even know which one it was  they're interchangeable to me kind of hit on me can't say the fat one and i i talked about on the 
[01:22:00]  air like yuck and ever since i've been yuck look at these two big fat pigs these two wow  thinking they know what's going on in boston the one in glasses i love the fact that she wears  she wears the uh the camouflage of the fat girl which is like a very colorful paisley almost yeah  so you don't know where like she begins and the background scenery ends so it just looks like a  floating head with glasses instead of oh my god that's all part of one living organism  it's like it's like a casino rug yeah exactly you can smaller that's good you can drop a 
[01:22:30]  a chip what what happened i screwed up my joke you said it's like a casino rug yeah i meant to say but  bigger i was honest i said but smaller but smaller because the casino rugs they're pretty big  she wears clothes that you would find on a casino rug because that hides a world of hurt like you  could drop chips there's a reason why the rugs are how they are at casinos because if you drop your 
[01:23:00]  chips it's hard to find them and at the end of the night house will pick one up perhaps i hear it's  it's good business man they sweep up chips uh you know all all the time and you'll notice the pattern  on the casino rug is it has all the same colors as the chips in them right in the uh rug so if you drop  it a lot of people aren't looking down for chips and then they clean up every so often and they find  chips look at these messes who think they know what's going on at bcn and and who think they know 
[01:23:30]  what's going on in boston in general they really are disgusting women it just this the one is has  her hair in her face of course you know what that's all about and then she's wearing like a casino rug i  bet they get together every so often sit up on the couch and watch a chick flick while they're eating  like rocky road ice cream this is good who needs a man right we have our ice cream are they married  what's their deal the one on the right looks like lithgow from garp yeah wow looks like a fat 
[01:24:00]  tranny you got a fat tranny and you got a bra that wears a casino rug trying to tell boston what's  going on what's going on in the scene man but that is what they should be doing just two just two  heart-stressed hens cackling at each other two jotting asses  they might bring a bathtub into the living room with ice cream in it and they eat out of that with 
[01:24:30]  two ladles they don't even use utensils just shoving their fat faces in there  crying in the bathroom in high school that's what they meant just from being torn oh definitely  oh we've been friends since we were just tortured constantly about how fat we were i want to know  how many times a year one of them is asked when are you expecting and they have to pretend they  didn't hear it and go what do you mean huh i didn't hear you i'm expecting what a fedex 
[01:25:00]  you can't mean a baby i'm just fat but it's just like nobody wants to hear you know broads talking  about rage what yeah well uh being bandied about once you name your saw your source this came up a few  months ago and we called them out and they and they yeah who's bandying it they hid once you were like  write a little uh article tomorrow and and tell us who your source tell us who's bandying  because i know uh i know differently and you know that it's not true just taking a little shot so 
[01:25:30]  just write your dumb article saying you hate opian anthony and then you support the hill man and his  dumb man show they probably do because just as two just as two sea cows they probably think that  that's funny like the whole gay like you know man town thing like that's what guys should do  guys should have like their own little room that they go look at naughty things  pigs  look at these messes oh who the f wants to hang out with them 
[01:26:00]  no one apparently i swear to god parties and no one hangs out with them the one without the glasses  honest to god she'd be wearing a tuxedo and singing paradise by the dashboard lights  she really looks like that fat meal  i will do anything for food  yuck what a disaster  yuck two disasters and they call us morning morons why are you calling us morning morons yeah huh 
[01:26:30]  uh let's say hi to joe joe what's up  hey how you doing guys hey yeah they are big uh hill man supporters i don't know of course fat  people loves hanging out together because they can't uh pick on each other about how fat they are  so you get a big fat hill man and a big fat manatees and they know they're safe 
[01:27:00]  on like a show one day during the week and i don't know what's going on now but they try to do a  a radio show it failed miserably did they really they're gonna call us morning uh morons how about  your radio show it went nowhere i've been doing this since i was 18 years old you fat pigs did this  do we have audio can we get audio on the radio show anywhere uh yeah let's try to get some audio  of these these uh these wonderful sites i guess they dish the gossip every uh they dish it out every  week on the mad show wait for man town they do the gossip right in do they fag hags no women you look

[01:29:00]  detail wrong there for the most part these gossip columns are just a waste of time and paper they  never get anything right oh i don't know and they don't have to name sources and they they they  they they they they sneak around uh at restaurants and bars they can i just know what's going on i  just like reading about brangelina for some reason i see them sneaking around those yeah how do they  sneak maybe around a blimp or something not a restaurant people when they come in they start 
[01:29:30]  hiding their food eating like they're in prison with their arm around the plate well it's time to  have fun with the manatees uh we're gonna have uh some audio of their fine radio show absolutely  oh really oh you got some of that uh mike what's up hey anthony what i just wanted to tell you it's  not gaily it's gail you dumb ass it's spelt g-a-y-l-e-e how the f am i supposed to pronounce

[02:14:30]  Where else were you going to go, right Rich?  This is it, man.  This is it.  This is it, man.  Isn't this great?  Make it sound like that's the place to be.  Ah, very, very nice.  We got more Bob Kelly audio we can play.  That's it.  You want to hear some more Bob Kelly? 
[02:15:00]  Who doesn't?  We also...  This is gold.  College students.  We also were turned on to some more Awful Meatloaf audio.  This is a quickie.  Oh, beautiful.  Might be a good way to start the show.  Absolutely.  Some more Bob Kelly audio.  We got Bob Kelly acting that we gotta get to.  From Meatloaf to Meathead.  I'm kidding, Bob.  Get it?  Get it?  Call me a kidder.  Meatloaf.  One of the listeners turned us on to this.  He kind of stood us up today.  Not kind of. 
[02:15:30]  Fuck him and fuck those fucking PR people that fucking douched us.  I couldn't say that on, you know, CBS is that way.  Of course not.  But fuck them.  Fuck him in the shitter.  Motherfuckers.  What happened?  We were kind of doing him a favor too.  That's what's...  He did this dog shit documentary.  This fucking tedious nonsense.  The big thing was the camera crews were watching him because he was going to be doing a DVD in Canada.  It's a whole who gives a fuck thing.  Big build up to his big DVD. 
[02:16:00]  Who gave a shit.  And the critics were attacking him because he does this fucking campy paradise by the dashboard lights reenactment with the girl who's way too young to be doing it with.  And it's just gross.  And it's embarrassing.  And it's like, dude, you're trying to be like fucking...  What are you doing?  You're wearing a football jersey.  You look like an asshole.  He looked like a fucking asshole.  Was he in today?  Did he come in?  No, he was supposed to come in today.  We were going to talk about his fuck.  I'm kind of glad he didn't because what I have said about this... 
[02:16:30]  I'm looking, I'm looking.  Just show Bob Kelly and Rich Voss the picture because, you know, Meatloaf ages like a motherfucker  and the girl has stayed the same age.  What happened?  Nothing.  It's just...  It's...  E-Rock had pulled those pictures up, right?  Yeah.  I'll find...  Because I need the name of the girl.  Her name is...  What are we laughing at?  I'm confused.  No, I was laughing because Dan was like...  E-Rock picked those up, those pictures.  It's hard to find the pictures. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  She's really a pretty girl and she's a great singer.  But it's just...  It was a whole gives a shit thing.  And Meatloaf just comes off looking like a hypochondriac and a fucking prima donna.  But now that he's 60 or close to 60...  He's only 60.  The chick should be about 30.  30?  She should be in her 50.  Well, I'm...  Yeah.  But I'm being polite.  I mean, the girl he's using is barely 20.  What's the matter?  Why'd you hire this chick?  Wasn't fucking Bea Arthur available?  You asshole.  Uh-huh.  You fucking pompous asshole mistreating your camera crew.  That fucking shitty who cares documentary. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, what's gonna happen?  Will he quiet the critics?  Don't waste your money.  He quiets them by putting on a fucking wig.  It's so embarrassing.  He has to wear a wig so it looks like a retro tribute to that shitty fucking tuxedo video  he did in the 1970s.  Which it still probably doesn't look like because he's just a slob.  Of course he is.  And he's fucking...  He has hair like Valerie Bertinelli in it.  And, uh...  The wig?  It's fucking horrendous.  Look at that.  It looks like John Candy right before he died. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, look at the size of him.  He has the balls to wear it.  That looks like Nathan Tulane's.  He's wearing a vest.  He's got a buttoned vest off.  Holy shit.  Hey, it's fucking Hitchcock singing to a hot chick.  What the fuck?  These pictures aren't as bad because those are a little older.  No, you gotta see...  You gotta see the new one where he looks like your dad in a football jersey.  He's wearing a sports jersey.  He's wearing a sports jersey like that groveling fucking move every place they go.  Here it is.  Look at this one. 
[02:18:30]  Look at this.  This one is the best one.  Here it is.  The collared shirt under a sports jersey.  Look, she's still the same age from the 70s and he's pushing 60.  It's fucking horrendous.  He's got a stupid football jersey on.  Just what are you doing?  Just dad going to the high school game.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  Look at that fucking Tom Arnold creep with his awful pants.  His fucking...  What kind of fucking rock star wears a fucking Chargers jersey with a collared shirt outside  of it, you jizz bucket?  And she looks like Punky Brewster. 
[02:19:00]  With her little white boots.  Kinda hot.  She's very sexy.  She's a hot Punky Brewster.  She's sexy, but they have to do a little make out.  And it creeped people out so badly.  Their fucking campy, awful reenactment.  It's like a father yelling at his daughter now instead of...  That is exactly what it looks like.  Instead of the hot thing.  Why he makes out with her?  Yeah, but it's just gross and uncomfortable.  With her Dorothy Hamill hair.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, they have to do a kiss, but the critics trashed him so bad.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, God.  This is it.  Wait.  There it is.  Look at that.  Look at his sweaty head.  His breath is probably awful because he's been fucking drinking Red Bull and singing.  Fucking old man breath.  Red Bull and cheese sandwiches.  Fucking medicine breath.  Meatloaf again?  Huh?  Yeah.  His breath like Tums.  Fucking old antacid breath.  Fucking rotten sweaty brow.  Oh, as he gives me the fucking creep.  Oh, he's just sweating all over that.  I'm happy.  I think we're turning the corner here because for a while we were worried about trashing 
[02:20:00]  people because we're trying to get more guests on our show, but at this point, you've  got to say, fuck them.  He looks like he just walked out of OTB before he kissed her.  Just beaten down fat old man.  Yeah, it looks like Colin Quinn making out with a chick.  Yeah.  You know?  Here's the PR people.  John Murphy, murphypr.com.  Maybe you guys know John Murphy or Marley Wilson from Vroom PR.  I mean, how Vroom PR?  Is it Vroom, V-R-O-O-M?  Vroom? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, the sound of a little car makes when a child...  No, Vroom.  V-O-O-M.  Oh, V-O-O-M.  Yeah, and...  All right, because I've heard of Vroom.  They're the ones who did this Vroom media.  And good not to fucking have them come on a nationally syndicated radio show that's  on in two countries and replays.  You fucking dummies.  You fucking dumb motherfuckers.  And what was the excuse why I didn't come on?  Well, there was a scheduling glitch.  He was never technically confirmed.  Really?  Is that why you gave us two copies of the movie, you shit dicks?  Two copies of it.  We promoted it.  We promoted that he was coming in. 
[02:21:00]  And then they go, no, he was never really confirmed for today.  Turns out he's not doing any press for today.  They say he's got meetings all day.  Really?  At eight in the morning he has meetings?  Do you think I'm a fucking dummy?  Well, yeah, but he doesn't have meetings.  You're the district attorney.  Why would I ask that?  Why would I ask that?  So where do we direct all this anger to?  At each other?  We have pests out there.  We didn't even ask them, but the pests have attacked the Boston Herald online website  and shut the damn thing down.  Well, I would never... 
[02:21:30]  Just because we were making fun of the fat manatees up there.  I wouldn't say go to murphypr.com and attack them.  No.  I would only say to email John Murphy or maybe Marley Wilson at voompr if you know them  and if maybe you think that you have a rational explanation for what happened and maybe they  would contact you.  You know, I would never ask anybody to write inappropriate emails.  No.  If, you know, again, maybe we have a lot of listeners.  Mm-hmm.  So if one of you guys knows them, you might call this happens frequently, whatever.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  Are you asking for the intelligent branch of the pest organization to take this one  on?  Yes.  Really serious emails only.  Only if you know them or whatever.  I mean, we don't need junk emails.  But the bottom line is they fucked us.  And I called John Murphy yesterday myself because I'm like, we always beat these guys up.  We never talked to them.  And he's like, oh, no, it was never confirmed.  Oh, you talked to John Murphy.  Yes, I did.  And I'm like, well, just so you know, we're going to deal with it on the air tomorrow.  He goes, I know you're bummed.  I know we're not bummed.  We're furious.  We've had it. 
[02:22:30]  We've had it.  Tired of being shit on.  We're tired of it.  Especially a meatloaf sized shit.  I know.  Giant.  Exactly.  Dinosaur.  Big, giant, thick, like a fireplug log.  It's pathetic that we were blown off by meatloaf.  Especially since he turned up on Regis.  We thought it might be a good little thing to check out.  I'm sure he'd be a good interviewer.  The guy was at the Parkland Memorial Hospital when fucking Jackie got out of the car.  Yeah.  He saw Governor Connolly get out of the car.  In Dallas?  Yes.  What was he doing down there?  He lived down there. 
[02:23:00]  He's from Dallas.  And he was in the hospital doing what?  Getting a book depository?  Yes.  A book depository.  Like a fucking cockroach eating the glue that holds the books together.  Fucking.  Fucking.  And it annoys me.  The only reason I attacked him so hard today is because he fucking, his people knew, by  the way, that we had been promoting this.  It got back to his people and they still didn't have him come on.  So fuck him and fuck them.  As a performer, if I knew a radio show, a national radio show had promoted me and stuff  like that and it was a mix up, that was because of the fucking cocksucker PR people 
[02:23:30]  who don't give a fuck, they'll just overbook them and then go, sorry, and they'll cut  out what they think is the weakest link.  So sorry you consider the Opie and Anthony show the weakest link, you fucks.  Yeah.  Fucking liars.  Let's all just fuck meat now.  Ooh.  Fuck a meatloaf.  Fuck meat.  That's it.  We'll make a meatloaf drill a hole in it.  Let's just get some meat and just start fucking it and send the pictures to them.  The first time I fucked meat.  This was sent in by a listener, Meatloaf on the Today Show.  First 30 seconds, whatever, but it's the end of I would do anything for love. 
[02:24:00]  Listen to the weirdness in his voice.  Make me some magic with your own two hands.  Can you build an Elro City with these strings of sand?  Can you give me something I can take hold?  Oh, I can do that.  Oh, I can do that.  Well, you fell to everything I got.  Well, you hold me down with holy water. 
[02:24:30]  If I can't do mine.  Well, you take me down to mine.  He went from his song to backup on his song.  What the fuck was that?  I heard.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Josh from Rochester.  Oops, I just accidentally attached a photo of a gaping ass with a pile of dicks in it  to John Murphy.  I was just trying to send an inquiry as to why Meatloaf couldn't come on the show. 
[02:25:00]  Could you apologize on air for me so no one else makes this mistake?  Yeah.  That would be bad, right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we apologize for that.  I think these publicists, they need to realize that we have a huge, faithful audience.  And then maybe we wouldn't get, we won't be blown off as much as we are.  No, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.  This is my, uh, my questions, uh, before, the questions I asked before, I was just wondering  if the people in PalTalk, um, had, had to listen to those questions and thought they were 
[02:25:30]  fine.  Okay.  Uh, ending of, I, uh, I would do anything for love.  Ah!  Oh, I can do that!  Oh, I can do that!  Oh, I can do that!  Oh, I can do that!  Oh, I can do that!  Tell a story I've been around, it'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down. 
[02:26:00]  And sooner or later you'll be screwing around.  It's like the Roman Pulaski story. 
[02:26:30]  I won't do anything for love, but I won't do that.  No, I won't do this.  Yes, you will.  That's Spitzer's song to his wife today.  He's wearing a vest and a big dumb scarf. 
[02:27:00]  Stop those fucking jowls from flopping outdoors.  She should get an Academy Award for the acting she was doing on that stage.  Oh, my God.  She's looking in his eyes with lust.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, she was.  She's hot, too.  She's calling the wedding band back now to go to them.  Get it?  Hey, why don't you hand me over the post there, Rich?  Make yourself useful.  Thank you.  Bobby.  Yes, sir.  So there's the picture of one of the girls, Elliot Spitzer. 
[02:27:30]  How is that?  That's right.  It's worth $4,000.  This isn't the one from the latest Rendezvous.  Yes, this is a girl called Sienna.  What do you think?  She's smoking.  Would you ruin your life for that?  I have.  You have?  No, I would.  Yeah, I've got caught shooting, man.  Let me tell you something.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, when you come home and the door isn't open, when  you go to grab that door handle and it's locked, you're like, your heart, your heart, when you 
[02:28:00]  go, every night you come home, that door's open, you open it up, hey, and then that one  night where you're like, oh God, and then you go to open it and it, I actually, and then  you hear, it's like five in the morning, you hear the elevator go, ding, because the doors  just opened.  Oh boy.  I'm telling you something, men though, it's, it's weird because we immediately go, we, a  man who gets caught, a woman who gets caught cheating, falls apart. 
[02:28:30]  A man, we immediately just go, whatever we have to say or do, we, we defend ourselves.  It's like, you know what, you know, I was molested.  Does that work?  An hour ago by that chair.  Oh shit, put the hat on, kid.  Oh yeah, swim walk.  There's no, uh, there's no defense when you're, uh, it doesn't, what are you going to say?  Oh, you, let me tell you.  You have to just, what do you, you walk away. 
[02:29:00]  Even nuts, you need to go on like this.  You got to Elliot spitzer the whole thing.  I did it.  I did, picture what he did.  An hour before that press conference, he went up to his wife and said, look, this  is what happened.  I'm going.  And you know what else did that?  The gay guy, the guy, the gay governor, walked up to his wife like an hour before and just  said, having a press conference, press conference and I'm gay.  Let's go.  I don't even think he told her ahead of time because the look on the stage.  Yeah.  She says she wasn't told until right there on the stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the look is like, what? 
[02:29:30]  What the fuck?  You got to compare yourself to, I mean, would you rather have your husband?  I mean, cheating with a hot chick or some dude, some twink.  What would a chick like?  What would your wife, would you rather your wife be cute with a guy or a girl?  I wouldn't mind my wife actually cheating with somebody who looks like me.  Really?  You're kidding me.  If he looked like me, I would be like, yeah, a seahorse.  Sorry, Bob.  That was a good one, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  Jackie Coogan's dead.  I wouldn't mind if she cheated with a guy who looked like me and, you know, he came 
[02:30:00]  over and cooked up some plankton.  Why would she go from a two to a two?  Fuck, you ruined all the fucking fun.  That wasn't bad.  What the fuck?  Can you hand over the Dilly News too, please?  There you go.  Let me tell you something.  Thank you.  Have you ever got caught?  Anybody?  Have you ever gotten caught cheating?  You ever get caught cheating?  No.  Never.  Technically, no.  You never got red-handed caught.  How'd you get caught, by the way?  This was a long time ago.  Just let me say that.  A long, long time ago. 
[02:30:30]  But I'm telling you, the technology is the worst thing in the world for sex.  It's just the worst thing in the world because, you know, the photos and the emails and the  stuff like that, it's just...  I don't cheat, though.  Like, I didn't cheat.  Yeah, why'd you have to cheat there, Bobby?  I wasn't like a cheater guy.  So, it wasn't like something I had to...  There's two forms of cheating.  There's cheating with a girl, holding her hand, telling her you like her, kissing her,  taking her to dinner, taking her to movies.  And then there's the massage parlors, you know, getting hookers and being addicted, trying 
[02:31:00]  to fill a gaping hole in your loneliness because you didn't have a father.  All right.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear you.  I never really cheated the emotional way where it was like, look, I met another girl who  I like her.  Right, right.  I didn't want to hold hands.  I didn't want to take her to the park and watch birds and shit.  And to you, there's a distinction between the two.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  If a girl cheats on you, she's not cheating on you to get dick. 
[02:31:30]  She's cheating on you because there's something about that guy that she likes.  What if it is, though, just to get dick or to be in a relationship?  What's worse to you?  What do you mean?  If your chick decided to cheat.  For dick?  Just for dick.  Right.  Or for kind of because, you know, she likes the guy.  Dick.  Dick.  Dick is worse?  It's the reverse for women, though.  It's the reverse.  Dick is, yeah.  Your chick is fucking just wanted some dick. 
[02:32:00]  Ugh.  Oh, I'd so rather, like, she found something emotionally attractive to the guy, like he  was nicer or treated her better or something emotional rather than just, I want a fat cock  in me.  And the guys, it's the other way around.  It's the other way around.  Right.  It's like when you want, like, I was watching this scene.  It was like a rape scene.  And I'm watching it in some movie.  And I'm getting hard. 
[02:32:30]  I'm watching it like, oh, shit.  But I'm also keeping my eye on my girl as she's watching it.  Because if she doesn't like it, like, I can't show that this is turning me on.  I'm like, ugh.  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  But I'm trying to fucking not fill up fully.  But I'm also watching her to see if she's into it.  Because it's like, if you're into it, you're a fucking whore.  Why would you like what I like?  Wow.  If you like what I like, you're a fucking ugh.  Because there's some woman being ravaged by some guy she doesn't know.  Yeah.  Just dick.  Just getting dicked.  And you have to sit there. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  I'm watching her.  If she's like, oh, you know, it's kind of hot.  I'd be like, you fucking dirty whore.  Beat it.  Wow.  But the thing is, when you do get caught cheating, you immediately have to really say to her,  look, I did this not because of you.  Not because it's because of me.  I'm trying to fucking help.  I don't know.  No, I'm a fucking piece of shit.  That's a cliche fucking excuse for cheating. 
[02:33:30]  It's me.  It's not you.  That's the same when they break up with you.  It's not you.  It's me.  Yeah.  I mean, what are you going to...  I mean, you gotta...  Look, man.  And you gotta say, you have to fucking stick up for yourself.  You have to stick up for yourself.  You have to say, look, fucking, you know, I don't know.  I gotta get help.  Does that shit work?  If you don't want to stay with me, I get it.  I understand.  But look, you know...  Yeah, I mean...  And then why are you staying with someone you're cheating on?  Like I said before, if it's an emotional cheat, if you just met another hot chick who you 
[02:34:00]  really like and you're done with this fucking broad, you're like, good, thank you.  Finally, you get me.  But if you really like a girl, this guy...  But if you really like her, you wouldn't be like, man, that's hot.  This guy didn't cheat because he fucking likes hookers.  He cheated.  I was trying to tell my wife this last night.  He cheated because she didn't keep up her fucking end of the bargain.  Honey, I need to call your cell phone a couple times and you not pick up and have me go, where 
[02:34:30]  the fuck is she?  Is she fucking somebody?  Why didn't you pick up your...  I need to be jealous.  You need to keep me on my fucking toes.  I need to call up and go, where the fuck were you?  Well, I was doing with my friends.  Well, you leave your fucking cell phone on.  When I call you at late at night and you don't pick up the fucking house phone and you don't  pick up the cell...  I don't want to know where the fuck you are.  Sounds healthy.  So he's the governor of New York.  He's supposed to act like Jake LaMotta.  What's the matter with you?  I'm just saying...  Why did you fuck them?  Why did you fuck the House of Representatives?  You suck his cock?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  You suck Mario Cuomo's cock?  I sucked his fucking cock and it's bigger than yours.  Bob, the thing is, I know what you mean.  You have to...  She has...  I'm saying you have to be jealous.  You need to be jealous.  If you don't give a fuck...  And they gotta be dirty and fuck your ass.  And they gotta...  Listen, they have to keep up their end.  They have to keep in shape.  You have to keep fucking...  If you shave your pussy and your armpits, your legs, and you do your toenails to keep  that shit up...  When are you gonna keep up your end?  We don't.  That's the best part of fucking about being a man. 
[02:35:30]  We get to go bald, get tits, hair on my ass.  I got fucking...  Oh my god.  I got skin tags under my armpit I had removed yesterday.  Oh, wow.  Just fleshy skin tags.  I mean, but because what women do is they get fucking pregnant, they have a couple kids,  and they say, fuck it.  And then all of a sudden, they start cutting the hair.  You ever notice around 50 women just say they stop dying it?  We've talked about that.  Yeah, they start looking like your best friend, man.  Yeah, they look like they pitch for the Yankees in 1978, part their hair down the side. 
[02:36:00]  Fucking cunts.  I told my...  I won't let my wife cut her hair.  It's like, don't...  You're not cutting your hair.  I don't mind the gray and stuff like that, but you're not cutting your hair to look like  fucking, you know, maud.  It's not happening.  Well, but they cut their hair because they say it's easier to take care of their body.  It's so easy.  It's easy.  My mother used to wash old women's hair, and, you know, old women's hair.  And what happens is they get it done. 
[02:36:30]  After a while, they just get it done because they don't want to shower.  They don't want to fucking shower anymore.  They just want to get their hair done.  They don't touch it for like two weeks.  They go to the parlor.  Right.  They get their hair in a big bouffant.  And they have to actually...  She had to clean these fucking women's hair with palm olive.  It's the only thing that would get the grease out of their scalp.  Dish soap.  Dish soap.  Palm olive they use to wash old ladies' hair.  And they wonder why their husbands are out.  And Elliot Spitzer's wife was in a no-win situation because she can't look as hot as those young chicks. 
[02:37:00]  Sometimes guys just want to fuck hot young girl.  I mean, no woman can compete with the chick on the cover of the post unless she's a total dom and she's got him so emotionally, sexually satisfied.  But man, once you pump out three kids, there's no way he's not going to want to fuck that chick.  A man that isn't...  A man that's married has the wife and the kids is making a sacrifice by being faithful to his wife and family. 
[02:37:30]  There's a sacrifice being made because he wants to fuck the girls that Elliot Spitzer has been fucking.  But you have to sit back and go, wait a minute, I'm married, I took these vows, blah, blah, blah.  But it's not like it isn't in their head.  They want to fuck that.  But he wants his...  Let me tell you something.  No.  He's not fucking...  But he's just... 
[02:38:00]  He's jerking.  He's paying some fucking girl to jerk him off.  He's just coming.  He's not fucking...  It's an hour.  She's fucking having a fucking thing of peanuts out of the minibar and then she's gone.  He's busting his nut.  Gone.  Now he's going to work.  He's going home.  Spending time with his family.  Doing all the shit.  Yeah, but you're not supposed to do that.  But that has nothing to do with how your wife looks.  Either you're going to do it or not do it.  Yes, it does.  No, I don't think so.  It does have a lot to do with how your wife looks.  A lot of it has to do with what other void you're filling, what addiction you're swapping. 
[02:38:30]  No, there's no addiction.  Look, don't turn this into addiction.  It's called being a guy.  Guys fucking look at hot girls and they're attracted to them.  He's right.  Some are attracted to the point that they want to have sex with them and take all their other responsibilities and commitments and vows and trust.  And everything and throw it out the fucking window and fuck.  Other ones can sit there and want to fuck.  They want to fuck just as bad as the guys that fuck. 
[02:39:00]  But they sit there and go, look, I got to just not do this.  It's called being mature.  It's good.  Yes, there are many words for it.  Mature is another one.  There is a decision that you make where it's like, you know what?  I'm not going to do this.  This is and it's a choice.  I'm going to be with this girl and whatever the fuck it is, I'm going to stay with her and  I'm not going to cheat.  In my case, I understand what Voss is saying, though.  Look, you're going to a massage parlor at two in the morning and getting a handjob by getting  a massage and a handjob.  It's affection and it's that touch. 
[02:39:30]  It's a high.  It's a high that somebody's touching you.  It's that instant gratification.  That's what it is.  But it's the fact that every time I went to a massage parlor, in my head, I pretended  like I didn't know what she was going to do.  Yeah, always.  There's this seduction.  Holy fuck.  She would touch my dick and I would go like, I would go, it was good.  She, she would touch my dick and I go, she goes, you like, I don't know.  I get, is that, is it?  You do that?  Yeah.  I would act out shy.  Yeah.  I guess.  Same thing.  Like when they fucking brush up against your ass, you push your ass back. 
[02:40:00]  What's better?  Dude.  I got on all fours one time and she slapped my ass and says, no, no, get back down.  What's better than the massage on the back of your leg when the finger brushes the balls?  Dude.  But it's 45 minutes in.  The 45 minutes in, she hasn't touched anything.  I actually position my hog so that when I get hard, it will stick out between my legs.  I've done that where it points back between your legs.  Yeah.  I've done that too.  They have to touch it. 
[02:40:30]  They have one of those dirty Asian fingernails.  And all of a sudden, she'll be doing your bum.  She'll be doing your hamstring.  And then all of a sudden it does.  It just grazes up your cock, touches your nut, and goes up through your asshole.  And you're like, oh my God.  It's one of the best feelings I've ever felt sexually in my life.  And it's just a fucking nick of your nut.  A nick of my nut.  And I'm like, oh my God.  And I just can't wait for her to do it again. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  It's un-fucking-believable.  And then they get you so fucking...  And then she'll go down to your feet and then come back up and then keep doing it.  Hey, hey, hey.  What?  Back up here.  Like, hey, come on.  What are you doing at the feet?  That's the best part though is that she'll go away and you're like, please touch...  And you don't say it.  Verbally, you don't say it.  Because in my head, she's not supposed to touch mine.  I'm getting a regular massage.  She just touched my nut by accident.  You know what I mean?  Oh my God.  I love this one too.  This is what I do too.  And they're like, you have any areas that you need worked on?  I always go, well, you know what?  I've been doing this treadmill and stuff like that. 
[02:41:30]  And the back of my legs gets really sore.  I fucking do that every time.  It gets her up in that area.  But you're not saying touching my upper thigh by my asshole and balls.  I went to one...  I went to one of...  This cunt...  This cunt rung me up for three hours.  I went in for a half hour.  She did like one part of my body every hour.  Finally got down to my fucking legs.  And I was like, yeah, my ham...  Exactly, my hamstrings.  I think I...  I told her about my knee.  I brought...  Yeah, I was in my knee. 
[02:42:00]  I heard my knee.  You don't even tuck my basket of fruit here between my legs so you can fucking brush it.  You don't get uncomfortable with them touching you?  Just touching you?  Don't even acknowledge that you heard a noise.  Yeah.  What?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Are you the angel on my shoulder, fuckface?  No, Jackie.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with something.  What show are we on?  What the fuck are we on?  Regis and Kelly?  No, I've never felt like shit.  No, no, no.  Listen to me.  You're wrong.  I'm saying there's nothing wrong with going to get a quick hand job or something.  Right.  But them touching you or fucking massaging and all that bullshit. 
[02:42:30]  That's fucking...  Dude, let me tell you something.  You smoked.  You put tar on your lungs and you're worried someone's hands are on your back.  What's the matter with you?  Don't worry.  Bonnie's not...  You suck dicks.  No, no.  Bonnie's not listening right now.  That's different.  That's different.  That's not...  Hey, you...  You had short shorts for fucking heroin fans.  Yeah.  Trying to turn on your drug dealer.  Yeah, you don't understand where they're coming from.  But yeah, exactly.  Short shorts for drugs.  You know, and when they start actually rubbing...  This is my favorite part is when they finally just go and grab it. 
[02:43:00]  They grab it from underneath.  So you're still in your stomach.  And they'll grab your cock from underneath and just stroke it a couple times.  And it's half full.  So it's still bent backwards.  And then I always get up on my knees and raise my...  I always get up on my knees and raise my ass.  Fucking animal.  What visuals make me laugh?  Oh, I always get up on my knees, raise my ass, and then they just start jerking it.  And then they'll tap your ass and then roll over.  And you just fucking rock hard. 
[02:43:30]  There was one girl who used to do this to me.  And I know you've had your asshole spit in.  Yeah.  She would spit in my asshole.  But then she started sucking my cock.  Like, she was actually blowing me.  Like, I would be on my hands and knees and she'd have that cock bent back.  Yeah.  And she'd be sucking it from the back.  And she had a sloppy, wet mouth.  And she would always say something like, oh, how much she likes sucking my meat pole.  Oh, God.  And my fuck stick.  Wow.  She'd be like, you got a nice piece of meat.  Oh, she was so fucking dirty.  I used to have an 18-year-old. 
[02:44:00]  And the only thing, I wouldn't fuck her because she was so young.  I just, I just.  What a guy.  Just the opposite word.  This is how weird.  I wouldn't fuck her.  This is how weird I am.  I wouldn't fuck her.  But the only thing she would do is blow me from behind like that with my cock like pulled  behind me and eat my ass.  Massage girl?  No.  Regular chick.  Oh, fuck, dude.  I would, you know who I'm talking about.  I used to have her wash my ass in the shower and blow me from behind and fucking eat my ass.  Wait, was it, um, was it, was it.  Eat your ass in the shower? 
[02:44:30]  Huh?  Was it suck on the ball?  No, no, no, no.  It was the.  Oh, it was a bar thing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She was sexy.  Let me tell you something, dude.  What a fucking slob.  What a fucking.  Oh, God.  I always wanted to fuck her.  I got to get to the phones.  We're losing.  One guy that said, look, not every guy wants to cheat.  He wanted to get in on this.  Yeah, fuck that.  I hope his car hit a pole and he couldn't.  And then you got Dana.  Dana.  Dana.  Hey, morning, guys.  Oh, Dana.  How are you, girl's name?  I apologize, sir.  I can't wait for the show. 
[02:45:00]  Thank you, man.  You guys are missing something fundamentally important that, um, a guy who doesn't want  to cheat, there's something wrong with him genetically because it's in our genes to  want to procreate with young, you know, sexy girls.  Heard that shit.  You got a fucking free will.  You got free will and a mind.  That's why you don't.  It's such an instinct thing.  Yeah.  No, it is, though, because look.  All right, Gene Simmons.  Hold on, dude.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  He's right, though, because look at every animal in the kingdom.  It is the males vying for the right to mate.  Yeah.  Every animal.  So we're no different, but we have the conscience that says don't do it. 
[02:45:30]  It's not right.  We have, like, this, uh, divine spark.  Yeah, it's called divorce lawyers.  Fucking converse.  And when women are nesters, they want the one they think is right for their entire life,  and that's how these women stick with their men.  You're right.  Like Spitzer's wife, potentially, and, uh, Clinton, and, you know, any other one.  I think it's because the nest is full of fucking money.  Yeah, the nest is made with money.  Yeah, it's not like if, if Elliot Spitzer was some fucking, uh, construction worker,  not with that name, it wouldn't be.  A tin knocker. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, that's true.  I'll say one thing.  Spitzer's wife probably-  The head of the building company.  Spitzer's wife probably does love, love him.  Hillary Clinton, you can never bring, she is a fucking methodical twat who would not,  if she dumped Bill, her political career would be over.  Yeah.  She'd be a fucking, just a housewife.  She stayed with him.  He cheated on her.  He's been cheating on her from college.  Okay?  He cheated on her when he was a governor.  He used to have special people in his office.  When she came in the front door, the chicks would be out the back. 
[02:46:30]  She's known about it.  Yeah, Stadies would bring the girls in.  Exactly.  She's been, she knows that she, he's a piece of shit.  And he, he'd been cheating on, I think it was, what, three times he got caught in the,  well, he was the fucking president, the fucking president of the United States of America.  This cocksucker just went, I'm sorry.  And she stood by her fucking man.  Fuck her.  She knew what she was doing.  She wanted to be fucking president someday, or vice president.  She stuck by that fucking big nosed asshole.  So she could have that.  It had nothing to do with love and family. 
[02:47:00]  It takes a village, a village of whores that your husband fucked in the office.  Alone in the apartment.  This is alone in the apartment.  The two dogs are looking at him like, we're fucking not even the same species.  This boring asshole.  And this is what he's done.  I keep fucking, dude, she fucking, he just wants to be in front of our fucking audience.  I have a, where they go, God, that was right.  I have a, I have a mirror in front of my fireplace that I rehearse in.  Dude, dude, she stayed with him.  His fingers are pointed.  She fucking knew. 
[02:47:30]  And meanwhile, he's holding his shit in.  Like, he has this shit, but he's sucking it back in.  And she knew.  Let's go to Matt in New Mexico.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Can't wait to see you this, uh, this Friday night.  In Denver?  Denver.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Gothic theater.  You know, the first thing I think I want to hear about this Elliot Spitzer thing is,  what was his wife not doing anymore?  Because if your wife is hot and she keeps herself in shape and she acts out every fantasy,  no man in the world is going to cheat. 
[02:48:00]  No way.  Well, yeah, that's different.  Why would he risk losing it?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I agree with that.  We said that earlier that she stopped getting sloppy somewhere along the line.  She stopped spitting on his cock.  She stopped doing it.  And it's important to fucking, for your, I told my wife last night, you have to keep  up your end of the deal.  What you get, what you, what you're bringing in right now that I'm agreeing to be with,  you have to keep that up.  Meanwhile, his end of the deal has collapsed fucking three years ago.  Bob's a fucking, she's hot.  She fucking looks good as a girl. 
[02:48:30]  Bob's a mess.  Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about, X-Men body.  I know I'm horrible.  What are you, but I'm not.  Yeah, but you're talking like you're a personal trainer, you mushy asshole.  I know I'm mushy.  You came out of an apple and fucking met you, girl.  But I'm not, but I'm not, I'm not warning, I'm not warning chicks.  Now, honey, you better keep up your end of the bargain, or this might mosey off.  Really?  Like King Tut from Batman, what are you going to do?  Where the fuck are you going?  You should be.  She could shit on the floor and say, clean it, and you would. 
[02:49:00]  You're not going to leave her, you can't.  You should be warning chicks.  This should be a warning.  Trust me, make me wear a condom.  Because I'll lie to your face.  I'm saying that a man, though, there's something about a man that even, the older we get, we  get sexier.  And we're always in the position of power, because we're going out, we're earning, we're  making the money, we're working our asses off.  This guy's a very powerful man. 
[02:49:30]  Women love power.  Women are, it doesn't matter what you look like with a guy.  If you're powerful, if you're like, we're funny.  I can get a chick because I'm funny.  I can still be fat and bang chicks just because I'm funny and I'm on stage.  You know?  My wife, you know, a woman doesn't do that.  But a woman's not, my wife's not going to go out and fucking just meet, hey, what's  going on?  And do a fucking set somewhere.  She has to be hot.  She has to be hot.  She has to know how to fuck.  She has to know suck dick.  That's not true.  Any girl can go out and get fucked. 
[02:50:00]  She doesn't have to have, she doesn't have to have a talent.  Yeah, but you can go out and get fucked, but you're not going to meet somebody.  Not every girl's going to go out and meet a guy that will want to be with her forever.  A guy will fuck you, but then go, look, I'm done with you, you fucking creepy chick.  And you think these girls you pick up after a show want to be with you forever?  Same thing.  They're just fucking you.  Yes.  A lot of these fucking girls would fuck, yeah, they're looking for you.  They want to be with you.  They want you to be their man.  When you fuck a chick as a guy, you're not looking for her to be your chick.  When a woman fucks you, I believe that she is looking, like there's potential. 
[02:50:30]  Most of the time they want you as.  You're their guy.  Yeah.  As he's saying this, he has toast crumbs.  On the front of his sweatshirt, he's got crumbs all over him.  Let's be specific, it's a wheat toast.  Mike Fresno, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say I really agree with Jimmy.  I mean, I'm kind of into some of the same kind of little freaky shit that he is.  My wife, we both put on a lot of weight.  We've been married seven years, but she still satisfies me emotionally, sexually.  She's a freak. 
[02:51:00]  She does all that crazy shit I like, and then as soon as we get out of bed,  she takes care of my four-year-old daughter, goes off and be the school teacher.  And later on at night, she gets freaky again.  So that's why I don't cheat.  I still want to fuck young girls in my head.  Sure.  But I just think about how freaky my wife is.  No 18-year-old girl is going to do some of those freaky shit I like.  Like what?  Like what?  Yeah, what's your freaky stuff?  Tell me something.  What?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I like the way my wife licks my ass.  My wife's sitting on my face, and she's got a little yellow treat.  I kind of like that kind of stuff. 
[02:51:30]  I like a girl to tell me to smell her ass.  Like as long as it's got like a nice ass sexy smell, like smell it.  God, smell it.  Okay?  I love how Jimmy has to bring his voice down when he starts talking to perversion.  You know, Bobby knows.  You know, I like.  This is what I like.  Let me tell you about it.  Well, you know, it really is on the chick to actually keep her shit together.  And sexually, I mean, if your chicks, you know, like I talked to my girl about this.  We have to get a little dirtier because you want me to.  She wants me to be more loving sexually. 
[02:52:00]  You know?  She wants me to go from fucking craziness to loving.  It's like, you know what?  You have to come a little my way, too.  You have to do some freaky shit that I like.  I'll try to, you know, we'll have sex a little more.  We'll do a little more cuddling or intimacy, whatever the fuck you want that way.  But you're going to be a little freaky, too.  Get a couple outfits.  Get a backpack and a lollipop.  And get a fucking, you know, a fucking nurse's outfit or whatever you got to do to keep up my end of the bargain.  Your end of the bargain.  All right.  One more.  Mike in New York. 
[02:52:30]  What's up?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Basically, Chris Rock said it best.  A man is as faithful as his option.  He's brilliant as a girl.  You could be as loyal as you want, but you have a little girl, like a little hot girl coming to you at a bar.  If she wants to do you, it's tough to turn down, you know?  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Look at all the guys in relationships going, hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I don't want to say, first of all, you don't have to cheat.  I don't cheat on my chick.  I fucking love being with my chick.  There's nothing wrong with being with the chick and like being with her and not cheating on her and making free will. 
[02:53:00]  Like you said, it's your choice.  That's fine.  I'm in that too, but you have to, you have to, uh, there is, I mean, look, I still go, I download porn on the fucking internet.  She comes home.  That's different.  And I'll do, I'll have nasty shit up.  Like, you know, she came home one day.  I had fucking, uh, squeal like a pig on my computer.  It was your face.  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah, you were just updating your website. 
[02:53:30]  Damn.  Did you just say dare?  What are you, a black fucking chick?  Damn.  Damn.  So why did he...  Oh, he said squeal.  I thought he said eat.  I'm glad that Norton just saved you from a bomb.  Go ahead.  What did you say?  I got it.  No, well, well, come on, Rich.  What was it?  I got it out.  I see.  What did you say?  You got another one.  Let's go.  What is it?  Yeah.  You know, uh, it's so weird because...  Every time...  Any girl I ever went out with, I always wanted to bang someone else. 
[02:54:00]  But there's times in your life where you're content and you don't want to...  But ever since I met Bonnie...  No!  Me and Bonnie are just the ultimate couple.  It's also where you are in your life.  We're a power couple.  Bonnie's listening right now, so I better say this.  It's where you're at in your life because you got to consider that what I've done in  my lifetime sexually since I got, you know, sober, I, you know, I did replace drugs and  alcohol with sex and food.  Once I, once I found out, once I found out, you know, that you could do this stuff, I 
[02:54:30]  just go fucking bang broads.  But there's a point in life where you're like, I've done everything.  You're a food slut.  Yeah, but see, that's what I said to you earlier.  You were just transferring addictions and you said no.  Don't forget to say no.  No, I said that it's not an addiction to cheat.  No, it's a void you're filling and when you, you can transfer it, when you're, when you're  doing drugs or alcohol, you're filling a void and you could do the same with sex. 
[02:55:00]  But if you're a married guy with kids, then you have a void.  There's a void.  There's a void to be filled for everybody.  If you're a married guy like Elliot Spitzer, your wife is getting a little up there.  Uh, you got three kids and a lot of responsibility.  The fucking hole you want to fill is that blonde on the cover of the fucking post.  Yeah, man.  There is a normal side to that too, where addictive sexual behaviors like me, when I'll  zone out for four hours and jerk off with my dick limp just to do it, that's sickness. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, just pre-semp dripping on the floor for an hour and a half.  It's like yanking a piggy tail.  My fucking dick is limp.  Like a drippy faucet.  But when you're just banging a fucking hot chick like that, it's normal.  You're 50, though.  I'm not saying that in a bad way, but you have a younger wife, an attractive wife who  you like.  It's different.  If you met her 20 years ago, you might have cheated because you were still on that dirt  bag stage.  I'm not justifying it.  I'm not saying it's right.  And I'm not saying that every guy is a cheater. 
[02:56:00]  I'm absolutely not saying that.  But I am saying that there would be this void that you're talking about.  It's not this addiction that only a few people have or that has to be.  Dealt with, with therapy or something.  Right.  It's just there.  And it's something that can be handled with your own fucking willpower.  Some people don't have willpower.  That's what I mean.  But that isn't some fucking addiction.  That's people without willpower.  Right.  I mean, Jimmy's what Jimmy's saying.  Some people just don't have it.  Is when like what you're talking about, just a chick like that or going with like what 
[02:56:30]  he was talking about, like if you're, you're the hooker you're with has bigger biceps than  you.  That's a fucking, that's a little, that's a bad move.  That's a bad move.  That's a fucking bait and switch.  Doctor photo.  When they snatch the glasses off your face.  Doctor photo.  Oh, my favorite animations.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I have two things real quick.  Jimmy, the one time when you said you had a woman that like when you were laying down,  she was licking your ass and sucking you from behind and telling you great hog and everything 
[02:57:00]  like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A nice piece of meat.  Can I map quest that place?  Is there a way I can get over here?  How the heck do you get to that place?  Oh, no.  Dude, I haven't seen her.  Honestly, God, she used to come to my place.  I haven't seen her in years.  I don't even know if she's still in New York.  Some of these girls fucking leave, man.  It's unfortunate.  But I think she always, I always just see her at my old place.  Where do they go, Jimmy?  Where do they go?  I don't know.  It's a fucking hooker heaven.  It's unfortunate.  Jesus.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got more.  Can we just say that me and Jimmy, like I think I can speak for Jimmy.  This is, what we're talking about is years ago. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, I'm not talking about last Tuesday.  Wow.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  No, I'm just saying that this, honest to God, I made a decision, like you said, like  four years ago.  Look, I'm going down this road.  I'm going to try to get, I'm done with this shit.  Because I didn't want, I don't want to wind up like this asshole and be a 50 year old  fucking batch of, like Colin Quinn with big earlobes and fucking skinny legs, not being  able to fuck anything.  He really is a fucking, I don't know.  You know. 
[02:58:00]  He's a top heavy fucking, he looks like a caricature.  He has fucking teeny legs and a giant awful torso and head.  Yeah, he's got elephant earlobes.  They should have plates in them.  He's a king in some fucking cultures in South America.  Fucking like thin girl fingers.  He does.  A little thin, his little wooden puppet nose.  His fucking awful blotchy skin when he gets nervous.  Oh, poor fucking Colin.  I just can't wait until his fucking toupee blows off the patch of hair he has up there 
[02:58:30]  that's just hanging on.  That fucking hairdo he has is atrocious.  And he's getting balder as he gets fatter.  It's just shrinking.  Fuck as shit.  Because his fat head is expanding.  All the fuck as shit.  Fuck as shit.  Oh, wow.  Folks, I'll be in the comedy club with the Keith Robinin show.  You know, some people can talk about it.  Somebody can't talk about it.  Just collapsed against the wall.  There's fucking awful.  His doll fucking, his doll sweet body. 
[02:59:00]  He's a fucking, he really does.  He's a doll sweet.  Him and Patricia's remake, give me a break.  He's an awful sinus.  He's going to wear a sleep apnea mask at night.  Like a fat Darth Vader.  Like a jackass.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Bob Kelly, Rich Voss is going to be at Stress Factory.  And we'll continue.  We found more awful meatloaf. 
[02:59:30]  So it's one of the running themes today.  So we'll check that out next.  Also, we got a reporter that was attacked by a family.  This is a really great story.  We love when this happens.  We'll get into it next.  Whether you like a middy-ditty, medium or enormous.  Courtesy of Opie Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  Get your free wrap flicker.  No reason to go and buy it.

Think you want to get wowed? 
[03:00:00]  Watch the ladies whip her mouth and jump around.  Jump around.  Jump around.  Jump around.  Oh, man, Anthony!  Exactly.  Dean Wormer's wife is sexy, too.  Yeah.  I mean, she's sexy.  Wow.  We're talking about Spitzer's wife.  And we're looking at the footage of them.  And, you know, we can't.  And she's a good-looking older broad.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  But, uh.  Yeah, she's like one of those that everybody's probably like,  Oh, Elliot, she's so beautiful and everything.  And, which, you know, it's fine.  Yeah.  And if he wants to stick with that, that's fine, too.  And the kids and everything else.  But then you look at the cover of the post and go,  Ah!  She's smoking.  Is she a Jew?  Do you realize she's had a third?  Is she a Jew?  Is she a Jew?  Elliot Spitzer, the Jew.  The Jew with the claws.  The shapeshifting Jew.  The shapeshifting Jew. 
[03:01:00]  And the horns?  And the horns, uh, Jew.  Here's why he doesn't want to fuck her anymore.  Because she's had a third of a baseball team marked out of her cunt.  Do you realize the fucking outfield popped out of her box already?  She really does.  Why would he want that?  She has fat kidroids coming out of her asshole.  That's why she, he wants to eat an asshole that doesn't have lumps on it.  He has to worry about it popping like pomegranate seeds.  Fuck her.  Oh, shit!  Fuck her.  Her overly fucking, overly perfumed body. 
[03:01:30]  She tries to fucking, she tries to trim her pussy, but she gives up and misses spots.  It's like an older gentleman's chin.  Her lip just has a spot of hair on it.  You're like, what is this?  Her fucking pussy smells like a ghost.  It's just fucking awful.  You know what she is?  She's not bad for a wife to go out and be a chick and fuck every once in a while.  But when you want to fuck a hot, look at that.  No stretch marks on her stomach.  You know her stomach is all stretch marked out and her belly button looks like a baby's fist. 
[03:02:00]  How come a guy, how come a 21 year old or a 22 year old would rather fuck an older woman?  He would.  Some do.  It's called milfing.  It's a goof.  No.  It's a fucking goof.  It's a goof.  It's a goof.  It's cougar hunting.  Cougar hunting.  It's a fetish, Rich.  It's not for real.  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to move on to other things, but Spitzer to resign effective Monday, sources  say.  Breaking news.  Watch him legalize prostitution.  That was way out.  You know he's going to go fuck something this weekend. 
[03:02:30]  Bring back the nude dancers.  Completely nude.  What?  I didn't realize that part.  I didn't see that part.  What?  When they walk off the stage, Spitzer and his wife, he puts his arm around her.  They walk to the wing of the stage and then to the open part of the back curtain, and  she walks a little faster and steps in front of him, and he's got to take his arm off her  back.  Yeah.  She wants no fucking part of him touching her.  You can't.  He's going to talk at 1130 this morning as well.  Yes.  Eastern.  Eastern time. 
[03:03:00]  Eastern time.  So it's going down very, very soon here.  Spitzer definitely has one of those big fucking huge mules, too.  Look at his face.  Really?  But, yeah.  You think so?  He looks like fucking Mike Birbiglia.  All right.  We're going to do speed round.  We've got a lot of things going on here.  Most people knew what you were talking about.  Yeah.  Here we go.  We've got more meatloaf from an A&E special that E-Rock found.  We're obsessed with meatloaf today.  More bad singing.  Because he's a...  This is great. 
[03:03:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  And put the food right in.  Stick the vocal cords out of your mouth, too.  Put the nose right out of my throat.  What happened?  He sounds like me in the shower. 
[03:04:00]  He's not hitting the nose, though.  Flat.  That is awful.  He obviously didn't take the muffin out of his mouth.  He does sound like a tranny's peeing in his mouth.  If only his belly was as flat as what's coming out of his mouth.  Took the words right out of my mouth.  Oh, that's stupid.  Oh, it must have been like, yes, it's me. 
[03:04:30]  Took the words right out of my mouth.  He looks and sings like Big A now.  And then you got...  Two out of...  Three...  And now we got the Detroit mayor using the N-word.  We had this story earlier.  We finally found it.  And finally tonight,  and this may be the most talked about part of this speech  after laying out all of that. 
[03:05:00]  But I feel that I cannot leave this auditorium  with my wife and my son sitting there  without addressing this issue.  In the past 30 days,  I've been called a nigger.  More than any time in my entire...  He's the guy that buried the word, right?  Yeah, what happened?  More than 30 days, what happened?  One app, one app.  Now at least I realize I got the right email address. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, Jesus.  More than any time in my entire life.  What, did he go to a Red Sox game?  In the past three days...  Oh, God damn.  Ah, fucking Boston.  In the past three days,  I've received more death threats  than I have in my entire administration.  Close your ears off.  Oh, what's a death threat?  I've heard these words before, 
[03:06:00]  but I've never heard people say them  about my wife and children.  I have to say it because it's very personal to me.  I don't believe  that a Nielsen rating  is worth the life of my children  or your children.  Yeah, wait, what?  He did it.  A Nielsen rating?  Well, they're getting ratings 
[03:06:30]  by reporting the story  that he cheated, I guess.  Oh, oh.  He did some kind of...  I guess that's what he's...  Oh, he's probably getting  accused about the cops and shit.  He's probably getting fucking...  Yeah, all right.  When you shit on the cops like that  because they're doing their job  and they're doing a little investigation on you  and then you fire them,  that's something you can't do.  Fucking Nixon tried that  with people investigating them.  Fire them.  Fire them.  Where's my Jew, Henry?  Remember the granny 
[03:07:00]  that was stuck in the closet yesterday?  Yes.  Of course, who could forget  that they had the exclusive interview  on the Today Show  and while you guys were doing  that wonderful rant about cheating,  they had her on  with her old lady hat  askew on the top of her head.  The one that should be removed  by that fucking guy.  I love that guy  in that video  with the 101-year-old woman.  The old hat remover.  That's the way  you take an old lady's  fucking hat off.  You punch it off.  If she's so fucking rude,  she doesn't understand  that when you're in a building,  you remove your hat.  The only way to handle it 
[03:07:30]  is to ball up your black fist  and punch it off her fucking head.  Knock that Hungarian bitch's  fucking crown right off.  When did that happen?  It's just so fucked up.  That was a little while back.  Yeah, it was a very...  A woman was mugged  in her apartment building  when she stepped out  of the elevator.  I'm sorry.  She gets out with a walker  and some gentleman of color  comes up to her  and decides she needed  to remove her hat.  That a lady doesn't wear 
[03:08:00]  a hat indoors.  And she needed to be removed  over a pocketbook.  Do you have the video,  Thanikins?  I've got to show up.  How do you not...  You've never seen this video?  It's unbelievable.  This guy is fucking...  He was the winner  of the hat removal competition  three years in a row.  Well, that is the penalty  if you're an old lady  with a hat on indoors.  You get your punch in the face  and your purse taken away.  Yes, of course.  They just take your hat off  quickly.  You should have known.  Let's say hi to Sean  in North Carolina  as we find that video.  Sean, what's up?  First of all, Jimmy,  you killed Saturday night.  Thank you, buddy. 
[03:08:30]  And Anthony,  why didn't you tell us  you had a house guest  for the past two days?  Ah.  Hmm?  What?  Boo.  Boo.  I don't know what that means.  You had somebody over, Anthony?  No, I think he's trying to, like,  equate what we were just talking about  with being my house guest.  What?  What?  You had a prostitute or something?  No.  Oh, I know what he's talking about.  What?  No idea.  I didn't get what he was talking about, 
[03:09:00]  but I think he's trying to tie in, like,  Something else?  what we were talking about.  All right.  What?  Oh, she got punched.  Look, here it is.  This is just really is awful.  This is our real footage.  Look at how rude she is  with that hat indoors.  Look at the gentleman's  trying to instruct her.  Can you do the dialogue  that actually happens  since we don't have it?  Yes.  Can you do the play-by-play, please?  It's pretty quick.  I'll be the old lady.  Hello, sir.  Madam, where did you learn  your manners?  Take that hat off.  Ow!  Ow!  Take that hat off.  Why?  It's off. 
[03:09:30]  It's off.  It's off.  It's off.  It's off.  It's off.  It's so awful.  It's off.  It's off.  She took three.  Take it off.  Keep it off.  Keep it off.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Our little walker tips over.  He knocked that bitch  Look at the wheels  spinning back and forth.  And he takes his bike with him.  He has some old bag.  Can we watch that again?  Remove your hat.  I said remove your hat. 
[03:10:00]  It's off.  It's off.  It's off.  It's off.  And he's still  sucking her.  He's blasting her.  He's like looking  through her purse.  Are you thinking  about your hat?  Are you thinking  about your hat?  Are you thinking  about your hat?  He's looking.  He's feeling her up.  Are you thinking  about your hat?  Don't put your hat back on.  Go down there  get your hat.  Go down here  get your hat.  Did he walk her?  It took four punches  to get her down.  I think she called him  something because  he turned around  with this  What did you just say?  What did you just call me? 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  She actually reached  for a pocketbook again.  That's why  you can see  he takes it  and then she reaches for it.  Well he's trying  to be a gentleman  and get her  and fucking  he's like trying  to like hang her coat up  and be a gentleman  and she's like being  she's like fucking up  the whole thing.  Look at her.  He's trying to look  at her jewelry.  You know what happens?  She reached for another hat.  She reached for another hat.  So he had Papa  with his shorthand right  with his short arm right.  Well they say  that she hadn't trained  for the right hand lead.  No.  Like she had been  so ready for the  fucking jamming  and the dancing  and the ducking  that he just threw 
[03:11:00]  a right hand lead at her  and no one.  I cannot tell you  how funny  the little wheels  spinning on her walker  like shopping cartwheels.  The hat pops off  like Rocky  when Adrian was going  to the ring  at the end.  It pops right off her head.  Look he's ready to leave  and he's like  what did you ask?  Well she's an instigator  obviously.  He goes through her pockets  a little bit  see if she's got another hat  and watch  she turns around  but she  and then she goes  to grab  a hat.  The worst part though  is the way  her fucking hair  billows out  with her.  All right. 
[03:11:30]  Hold on.  That big puffy  cotton candy head.  Watch the way  the fucking hair  looks like Andy Rooney  the way the hair  looks like the way  the hair shakes.  She's like a rock star.  When her hair shakes  when she reaches down  she can take a hit  though.  Oh she sure can.  She can take a punch  this broad.  She's hair like  Edgar Winter.  Rich what do you think?  Look here it is.  Wait why's the hair  pull out?  You know wait  you guys are sick man. 
[03:12:00]  What the fuck's wrong  with you?  What the fuck  is wrong?  You're fucking  insane.  What do you say?  They're just  fucked up Rich.  The way her hair  billows out  is hysterical.  She's all  hard to play.  When she goes down  and she doesn't  play games.  What's wrong  with you guys?  She's fucking  damaged. 
[03:12:30]  Fucking David Bowie.  Rockstar.  She tries to hold  out and stop  and look at that.  She's trying to  hold her.  I'm cock sucking  but she falls.  Oh Rich in her  glass jaw.  What the fuck  is wrong with you?  Jesus man.  Rich what do you think?  What do you think?  She should have  never gotten  in the ring with him.  I see.  I just see how  times change.  There was a time  that she would sit  on her front porch  and he would  bring her tea.  Oh God.  That hair looks.  What does that 
[03:13:00]  hair remind me of?  That's a cheat.  Look.  As she's falling over  and he pushes her.  Get down there  bitch.  Holy shit.  Look at her.  She looks like  dusty rods  going down  from the top.  Oh my belly hurts.  Oh that was a  tussleable  fucking head of hair.  Holy mackerel  did she have a full head.  He tussled it.  He sure did.  He's got a ground 
[03:13:30]  I'm tired  of looking at your head.  Fist as big  as her head too.  Did they ever  catch this guy?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah they did.  Yeah.  And she's now  101.  He's going to  Gleason's gym  to fucking work on it.  Took him four shots  to get this whole back.  Oh the laughing stock  of the yard.  She better go  hit the speed back.  I could have  knocked that bitch  down with two shots  maximum.  One belly.  He should have  went to the body first.  Alright let's go  to Brian the trucker.  Brian what's up?  Hey guys.  One, two, three.  Hold on what? 
[03:14:00]  Hold on what?  Brian.  Yeah I'd like to say  Kwame Kilpatrick  is a big  What?  Well.  Trying to get  the truck horn bit  going and they still  aren't doing it right.  Can we watch?  I want to see from the top  because she looks  like Tanner Boyle  falling down.  It's Tanner Boyle.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Take that hat off.  Oh no.  Motherfucker.  Oh I fucking  can't get enough of it.  This is upsetting Rich 
[03:14:30]  so much.  It's Chris Washington  and the spirit  it's made.  Of course he's  the same age she is.  Oh please  don't take the  pictures of my son.  They're in here.  Oh Tanner.  What about that though?  Oh she took a tumble.  That is great.  God love her.  Fucking down  goes Peter Graves.  You ever seen a grown  drug addict  nigga?  Jesus. 
[03:15:00]  Peter Graves.  All right.  Take that  Wilford Brimley.  Jesus.  She's pushing on  Meals on Wheels.  Oh my God.  She has a fucking  Peter Graves head.  Peter Graves.  There she goes.  Oh goodbye.  Oh my God.  Oh down goes Gary Busey.  Down goes Gary Busey.  Oh my fucking God. 
[03:15:30]  She really does get hit.  Oh that fucking  mop do is fucking  Hey David Spade  don't fall.  Jesus Christ.  What is wrong with you guys?  But I was  just walking  She positioned herself  pretty much saying  could you punch me  in the side of the face?  Oh boy.  He fucking  gave her a hook  and the wheel  is still going  The wheel is just going  Look at her little legs  trying to get up again.  Oh she's trying.  That wheel is all  stay down.  Stay down. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Very good.  That hurt.  Boomer from Jersey writes  How bad is this video  where the voice of reason  is the guy that spread  baby shit on his face  less than a week ago?  You guys are just insane.  It's too funny.  Love that shit.  Steve and Derek  just handed this in  and then we're going  to go to that old  granny story  from yesterday.  Ladies and gentlemen  this is called  Baby Diaper Mustache.  Baby Diaper Mustache. 
[03:16:30]  How the fuck  am I going to do this?  You're going to  stick your fingers in there  and do it quick.  It's not a big deal.  It's like food  only you know  in the second stage.  Food in the second stage  is called shit, Rick.  Do it.  Mana.  Oh my God.  Look at that part.  This is a new world.  Do it.  A new fucking world.  Let me do it.  Oh my God.  No.  Oh God.  Open.  Oh no.  That is fucking disgusting. 
[03:17:00]  Pretty good job with that.  Very good job.  Very good, Derek.  Baby Diaper Mustache  on YouTube  if you haven't  checked it out yet.  William Cutter.  Now I got to defend you guys  because William Cutter  from Charleston  and he writes,  you're doing a fucking  radio show, assholes.  Critiquing a video  we can't see  like you're Bob Saget  ain't cutting it, motherfuckers.  Oh, shut up.  You got to use  your imagination there.  Plus, everyone's 
[03:17:30]  seen the video.  If we were watching  the Kennedy one  and we were saying  there he goes  behind the sign,  would you still not  know what we're talking about?  I mean, it's obviously  not as famous as that,  but come on.  It's getting there though.  It's getting the views  on Brick.  Just as funny.  Actually, I think  the video's on  Brick.com with audio  so you can check it out  for yourself.  Old woman mugged  in the search engine.  Can I say,  that's a fucking panic.  What the fuck  is wrong with you?  Oh, that is a scream.  All right.  Hey, uh...  Oh, boy. 
[03:18:00]  We talked about  the granny yesterday.  A tornado hits.  She gets stuck  in the closet.  We had the audio.  Well, they had  an exclusive interview  on the Today Show  and I do believe  she said shitting  during the interview.  Shitting.  She took cover  in a closet  to protect herself  from a tornado  she thought  was heading her way,  but the door locked  and 62-year-old  Susan Mitchell  was stuck inside  along with two  of her cats  for more than 20 hours.  So how did she escape?  She's lucky to be here  to tell us this morning.  Susan, good morning.  Actually, we're the lucky ones  because this is  some darn story.  This happened, what,  about a week ago?  Darn. 
[03:18:30]  A week ago?  Exactly.  You heard the tornado sirens.  Well, on the news  they kept saying tornado.  First they say warning  and then they say watch.  And this was watch.  And it was all around  Greensboro,  which is about  an hour away from me.  You grabbed two of your cats,  you ran into the closet  because you're supposed  to go into a secure  kind of a place.  Right.  And what was the moment  when you realized  that the door was locked?  Actually, I laid down  and fell asleep for a while.  I don't know how long  and I woke up  and I thought,  well, I'll get up  and go to the bathroom. 
[03:19:00]  Doorknob just turned.  It would not,  I mean,  it was just free-falling  and I was like,  no, I've locked myself  in this closet.  Dope.  Well, I was going  in the closet  to get my hat.  which was punched  off by a Negro.  Jesus.  I wanted to get  the new hat I bought  with the chin strap  in case  in case that vagabond  showed up again.  Andy Warhol. 
[03:19:30]  That's the line.  That's who it is.  She looked like Warhol.  Andy Warhol  gets punched in the face.  That's funny.  He fucking had  a Campbell's soup can  balled up in his face.  Fucking.  So I was going  to get my new  chin strap hat  so a Negro  couldn't punch it  off in the lobby.  As I stood there  sassing him.  William Cutter  wrote back,  Charleston,  South Carolina.  I saw the video  on break  and I take it back.  I love you guys.  Frunkus.  He filled in  the blanks there.  Now your phone 
[03:20:00]  was off the hook  and you live alone,  right?  Except for the cats.  So they don't dial  911 at all.  He's funny.  What do they do?  Besides,  they don't dial 911  but do they bury  cat shit in your vagina  when you fall asleep  in the closet?  Those little cat feet  kicking it back  into a box.  911 at all.  Because you had  three outside.  Because you had five  cats all together, 
[03:20:30]  five outside the door.  So how many hours  into this whole escapade  were you realizing  that you're locked  inside?  About two, three hours?  It didn't take very long  an hour or two  but then I thought  well all I can do  is sleep right now  and then I sort of  started,  this is almost  like a storage closet  so I was stravaging  around the closet  seeing what was in there  and I found a board  and I measured it  when I got out.  It was four and a half  feet long,  15 inches wide  and a half an inch thick  and I started  beating on the door  with it because 
[03:21:00]  you think of the door  as a means of escape.  Well how many hours  was this into  your escapade?  Right.  Probably about  four, at least  three or four hours.  Three, four hours, okay.  And when,  see what I did  to my door.  Oh, you hit it.  I hit it,  I'm pretty strong.  And the reason  I'm strong  is I give credit  to the Thomasville YMCA.  I do three days a week,  I do half hour  water exercises  and an hour of sleep.  Drown.  There you go,  you never know  when that good exercise 
[03:21:30]  is going to come in handy.  You ever seen  some of this  water exercising crap?  You're getting nothing done.  Of course you're nice.  You're getting nothing done.  That's fucking brain exercise  and not like yourself  in a closet,  you dummy.  Here's where she says  you're shitting.  It was a fucking  lock-on or closet?  Sorry we wasted  like two or three minutes  to get to this clip.  So, you know,  we need to also add  that there was some urgency  to your getting out of there  because you are a diabetic  and you needed to make sure  that you had  the things you needed  to stay healthy.  So at some point  you started beating  on that door pretty hard.  I kept hitting it  and hitting it.  I'd rest 
[03:22:00]  and I'd hit it.  And I was getting  pretty exhausted  and I wasn't...  Bob Murphy,  who knows a little bit  about tornadoes,  he goes,  she said first  it was a tornado warning  and then a tornado watch.  A warning is more serious  than a watch.  Basically,  she went in the closet  when the danger  had already passed.  When they downgraded.  That's great.  Oh my God,  they said partly cloudy  when I went to the bomb shelter.  Fucking overreacting old twat.  I'm terribly hungry  but I would have mugged anybody 
[03:22:30]  for a bottle of water.  I'm very thirsty.  Using that joke again.  So almost 20 hours,  about 20 hours.  And I was praying  and I was crying  and I was praying  and I was crying  and finally I was laying there  and I said,  please God,  you have to let me out.  And he said,  what is stronger?  Wood or sheetrock  and I realized,  why am I shitting,  hitting the door  when I can hit the sheetrock?  When I can shit on the floor.  Why am I shitting my pants?  I ask that question  every time I'm in the car  or buying something in the store 
[03:23:00]  or watching television  or I'm watching my programs.  My programs.  Oh, I stand up  and there's fucking pudding  all over my ankles.  Watching my cereals.  Why am I shitting,  hitting the door  when I can hit the sheetrock?  There you go.  And so what you do,  I said you had the door  in her hat.  And you came out  with this advice  so I say to everybody,  keep a hammer in your closet,  tie it your cell phone  around your neck  and be in shape.  Well, thank goodness  for the YMCA.  Thank goodness for you  and I'm glad to see you  healthy and happy in here. 
[03:23:30]  Thanks so much, Susan.  And I've enjoyed being here.  All right, good.  How many millions of people  had their time wasted  with that little feature  this morning  on the Today Show?  Who gives a shit?  Small broads  stuck in a closet.  Great.  Dummy.  And she'd start  punching the door  like Uma Thurman.  Oh, fuck.  If only I can remember  the movie.  Kill Bill.  Kill Bill.  Oh, Kill Bill.  Oh, yeah.  Kill Bill 2.  It's good.  Kimberly?  You'll need the two. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, and it didn't matter  whether you got it or not.  Excuse me.  Thank you.  Kimberly.  I actually didn't hear it.  Hello?  Hi, Kimberly.  Hello.  Are you in your closet?  No.  No.  She's from Oklahoma.  What's up, baby?  Tornado Alley, right?  Oklahoma's part of that  Tornado Alley.  Yes.  Tornado Alley.  What do you got?  I just saw your video  of the diaper  on my husband's phone. 
[03:24:30]  He has YouTube.  He has one of those.  We don't care.  That Anthony has.  He has the YouTube.  He's got the phone  that Anthony has.  What store did he buy it in?  You mean the iPhone?  The iPhone.  The one that has  a million people have?  Oh, yeah.  He had to have it.  It's not a Ferrari.  He's like Anthony.  He has to have all the new.  Man, you're off  on a horribly tedious tangent.  Get back on the road.  What do you got?  He said,  oh, I saw the video  and it's totally real,  so I don't care  what anybody says. 
[03:25:00]  How many people  are saying it's fake?  Just assholes  that don't like the show.  It's very obvious  that it's real.  When Bob Kelly was here,  Rich Voss was here.  Jimmy missed that day,  unfortunately.  It looked like  you mowed a lawn  and then turned  the lawnmower over  and took the two finger scoops  out of the bottle  and just wiped it  on your mustache.  In a fucking mulch pit.  There's no way  that's fake.  It's totally real.  People are just ridiculous.  You know,  I'll tell you this much.  If it was fake, 
[03:25:30]  it would be posted everywhere.  Break.com  decided not to touch the video  and they'd love us.  And the K-Rock website  here in New York City,  our home radio station,  they refused to put  any pictures or video  up from that day.  Certain people think  this is fake?  Are they out of their fucking mind?  A few.  Why won't they put it up?  Huh?  Because it's shit?  I don't know.  Yeah, because it's shit.  Baby shit is cute.  No, it's not.  It's baby shit.  No, it's not.  If you ate it or something,  I would understand, I guess.  Plus, you didn't see it.  A baby diaper mustache?  Stop.  Plus, you didn't see it happening, 
[03:26:00]  so it could have been anything.  You know, that's the problem.  Like, that's the thing.  You didn't see it coming out  of an asshole,  so it should have been allowed.  Right.  And this new governor of New York,  he's blind and black?  Yes.  I would explain my benefit joke.  It's kind of good, though.  He won't know that  they're walking him  in the back door.  It would be fun  if he had confidence in it.  He's trying to trip.  Wow.  You take your headphones off  in the middle of bombing.  What's that about?  He's like, you know what?  I gotta admit.  What?  Are you gonna quit the business? 
[03:26:30]  Everyone is, uh,  you guys wanna go check out  Elliot Spitzer after the show?  I know exactly where he lives.  We could watch him, uh,  do his thing.  I think he's gonna talk  right outside his, uh,  house today.  Oh, yeah?  At 11.30, supposedly.  Ah, I think.  Unless they're whisking him away  to somewhere else.  Yeah, they'll probably  bring him somewhere.  It'd be great if,  right in the middle of the interview,  her wife opens up the curtains  and she's just sucking a cock.  Her wife?  I'm sorry, there you go.  Fucking animal.  Thanks.  Thanks, Tony.  Sorry.  Tony.  I love calling you Tony. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, a lot of people are right.  I said, what a waste of time  and, of course,  J.A. from Atlanta.  Who had their time wasted, Opie?  How about all of your listeners?  Oh!  Well, he's right, though.  But I saw there was a clip  that, where she said  shitting, so.  Hey, one more story.  We got a reporter  that got beat up  for being just  a little too nosy,  I believe.  Right?  Is the video on  the internet?  Do you have the video,  fan?  It's on the news somewhere. 
[03:27:30]  I will look for it.  Check this story out.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.  Stop it, stop it.  Stop it, stop it.  Stop it.  You ain't gonna be  such a hell of a  come on my shit.  Stop it.  I think we're gonna need  a little explanation.  Where's Danny?  I think this is Danny.  I think this is the actual  audio from the video.  I guess a reporter  went to, what,  a victim's family's house?  What's the story, Danny?  Yeah, they get into it.  They play the way  the story runs. 
[03:28:00]  They play the audio  of the reporter  getting attacked  and then they actually  get into the story.  Okay, good.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.  Stop it, stop it.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.  You ain't gonna be  My photographer was  putting his gear away. 
[03:28:30]  He was already in the car  and he was looking  at what was going on  from afar.  So it was just me.  And she charged  across the street,  punched me,  pulled me to the ground  and at that point  I just had to try  to defend myself.  It's always our policy  to make sure  that we're courteous  and respectful  of the requests  of those people  who are going  through that tragedy.  And I think in this case  we definitely did that.  We also have a responsibility  to report the news  and to make sure  that the public 
[03:29:00]  is being informed.  This was a potential...  What fucking...  Do you have a story?  Responsibility to inform  the public  on nonsense stories?  What tragedy?  What was going on?  Yeah, Danny,  what was the story?  Why were they  at this house?  That might help.  Oh, you don't know.  You're reading now,  so great.  Danny went  and then looked  at the computer  like,  God, somebody  please help me.  Oh, look at this.  They mentioned  the fucking race 
[03:29:30]  of the family.  I said the same thing  when I first saw this.  No, not when I first  saw it this morning.  The family members,  all white,  began yelling  and charged  a black reporter.  These fucking...  How about mentioning  the race  of the fucking student  that was just shot?  The fucking student  body president  that was just shot  and the fucking color  of the guy  they're looking for?  Yeah.  Why not mention that?  Holy shit.  If you can't see  a liberal bias  in the media,  you're a dumb motherfucker.  I said the same thing  this morning  when I first saw  the story on the news,  I'm going,  why are they 
[03:30:00]  mentioning color?  Who cares?  Because it has  nothing to do  with a white woman  running out  and hitting a black  reporter.  Well, they called her...  They yelled racial slurs  at her house.  Who cares?  They were fucking...  The big deal.  They yelled fucking  racial shit all the time  when they attacked  white people.  Yeah.  Fuck, it's not important.  Why were they there  anyway, reporting?  Yeah, let's find out.  David in Jacksonville.  I fucking hate the media.  David, uh...  I was able to kill her.  Fucking...  Knock her hat off  at least.  You made her tracks.  Are you another racial one?  Where was the race  mentioned in that? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  No.  We'll have a listener  give the details of the story  because obviously  we don't have them.  What do you got, David?  Right, right.  It's a family of white people  and one of their family  members was arrested  and the reporters  showed up.  Actually, it was two  groups of reporters.  All right, slow down.  Slow down.  So why was this person  arrested?  Ooh, I don't know  the crime.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's kind  of important here.  Well, she said something  that we have a responsibility  to make sure  the public's informed 
[03:31:00]  and I strongly disagree  with that.  Some stories, sure.  When you've got a governor  that's sleeping around  with prostitutes,  that's a responsibility  to the public  to keep them informed.  But some just dopey story,  a reporter doesn't have  that responsibility.  That's assault  and battery charges.  They have the right.  More white on black  verbal and audacious.  Assault and battery charges.  The black reporter  goes there to get  a comment from  the victim's family?  Yes.  Well, no, just a report  in front of the house  for a location  because of the crappy  reporting local news.  Right. 
[03:31:30]  They have the right  to be there,  so I mean,  I can see why  they would get angry.  Oh, wait.  No, no, I'm sorry.  That's what they were  charged with after  they beat up the reporter.  No, Brown was reporting  on the death  of 73-year-old  Tommy Howell  who was killed  by a blow to the head  after an argument.  All right, you're done there,  Jacksonville.  You ruined it.  His body was found,  so there was a death  in their family  and the vultures  that are the media  stood outside.  I guess,  what's the responsibility? 
[03:32:00]  That's what I'm getting at.  Of course,  to talk to the dead guy's family  about what?  Like they were there,  they saw it?  There's no responsibility there.  You know,  you just know  it makes for good TV.  There's no responsibility  to the public.  Another vulture  in the media, good.  So an old guy,  73,  died  by what?  A blow to the head  after an argument.  After an argument.  Okay,  a reporter shows up  to get some comments  from the victim's family.  Yeah, there you go.  You got what you deserved.  Absolutely, you did.  That. 
[03:32:30]  We also have a responsibility  to report the news  and to make sure  that the public  is being informed.  This was a potential homicide  and you at that point  don't know  who else  could be in danger  and it is our responsibility  to make sure  that the information  is out there  and we take that  responsibility seriously.  So why do you have to  stand in front of  the victim's house,  you fucking,  you buzzard?  You fucking circling  the crime scene buzzard?  Why do you have to stand  in front of the victim's house? 
[03:33:00]  Well,  that it's not a fulcher.  Because they're all  prostitutes, man!  Zombie killers!  Oh,  they mentioning the race  really annoys me.  God,  I fucking hate this imagery.  What was the race?  Was it black on black?  No,  it was white on black.  I don't even care  if they mention that.  But it's like,  then you get this fucking  student body girl,  this white girl  who was shot,  the guy's black  and they never would mention it.  No race.  It's amazing.  No race.  It's because you assume.  All right.  I don't know.  So what,  are they going to keep  saying it over and over  and over again?  That's their thinking, buddy. 
[03:33:30]  That's their thinking, buddy.  That's absolutely right.  Wow.  What's going on?  Is that him leaving?  No,  it's not.  It's stock footage?  Oh,  believe me,  they will,  okay.  Is his house far?  Huh?  Is his house far?  From here?  Yeah.  A mere 20 blocks.  Right on 5th Avenue.  He lives in the city.  Right across from the museum.  No,  Patterson.  He's on about 79,  79th Street  and 5th Ave. 
[03:34:00]  Not saying anything crazy.  They're all camped out there.  It's not a secret.  It's a governor.  Somewhere around there.  I think they know.  Bloomberg lives on 66th.  Keep it under your head.  Yeah,  keep us between on 66th.  Knock your head off.  Yes.  I drive,  I drive 66th  and I'm right back  to my apartment.  Oh,  that's where he lives?  Yes.  Wonderful.  He doesn't live in the mansion,  right?  He lives in his own building.  Very nicer.  Let's go to Josh.  Josh?  Yes.  Yes.  I live in South Carolina.  I watched a news story last night 
[03:34:30]  and apparently the grandson  had killed the grandfather  and two of the women  that were arrested  were his sister  and his mother.  Okay.  So they're dealing  with their own shit  and this vulture  is trying to get comments.  Well,  apparently the woman  that was attacked  had already packed up.  They were ready to go.  That doesn't matter.  They were just probably  tired of the media.  Anytime a reporter  gets beat up, 
[03:35:00]  very rarely  do I think  it's not justified.  They've been such  fucking bags of shit  for so long.  They have no connection  to anything they're reporting.  They have no conscience  about any of it.  They don't care  about the victims  at all.  So anytime they catch  a fucking fist to the teeth,  good.  Good.  Good one, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love it that we're  talking about that  and then 10 minutes ago  we were just making fun  of an old lady  getting her face smashed in.  That's true.  Fucking flip-flopping  assholes.  We really are. 
[03:35:30]  We really are just assholes.  Hey, you know what?  Fucking the media  gets what they deserve  taking advantage of people.  Look at that lady's head.  The wheels are flopping.  Take your hat off,  you cums.  Funny is funny, dude.  That's true.  Speaking of funny is funny.  Should I have kids  for love?  Oh, wow.  I blew that.  I mean, that would have  been all right, too.  But speaking of funny.  It's just that sometimes  it's easier to keep  running away from things  rather than to commit 
[03:36:00]  to the hard choices,  even the ones  that make us happy.  That was 11.  You mean like falling  in love happy?  Getting married happy?  Having kids?  That kind of happy?  Gino.  You think my parents  were happy, Joe?  Wrong.  They were fucking miserable.  For years I had to go  through that.  Years.  So is this about them  or you?  Hey, man, no offense, 
[03:36:30]  but you know me  for like 12 weeks.  And granted,  I admit my head's  a little screwed up,  but there's no way  in hell you know me  well enough to understand  why.  I understand  that you can't keep  running away  from the thing  you're chasing.  That's what's making  you crazy,  not pizza.  Stay out of my head,  okay?  Bob Shelley.  And bliss my ass.  I'm going on break.  Look at me, Anthony.  Is this a play?  Look at me.  You're not Irish.  Look at me.  Oh, God.  How good looking am I?  Look at his hair 
[03:37:00]  is blowing.  Look at that.  What is this?  Holy Jesus.  What did you eat him?  We're seeing a video,  obviously,  Bobby doing some  of this acting  with a full head of hair,  at least 120 pounds lighter.  Who are you acting?  That's just his arm.  Jesus Christ.  120 pounds?  What is this?  What movie is this?  Looks like the Outsiders.  This is last night  at Eddie's.  He's got long,  curly hair.  I was the romantic lead.  I see that.  You're looking off  into the distance  between your lines.  If you heard this dialogue, 
[03:37:30]  you'd fucking throw up.  Right now?  What's the scene?  What's the scene?  You and Grandpa Lewis,  that sounded good.  Yeah.  What's the scene?  This is where  I'm talking to her  about the desert.  Are you talking about  traveling the world  and finding God?  That's it, yes.  Yeah, finding God.  I really wish we had that.  California sunsets  out so bad.  I'd like to see that someday.  But I just don't get out  that much.  You should. 
[03:38:00]  It's a beautiful country, Allison.  Last time I went down  to the Colorado Rockies,  pause that for a second.  It's a beautiful country, Alice,  and I've opened for Dane  all over it.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Look at him  with his jerry curl in.  This is me talking  with the retard kid.  Got your jerry curl  in your hair.  Look at this.  Watch this, though.  Look at my lip. 
[03:38:30]  Look at that fucking face.  Fuck you.  You look like a fucking  Puerto Rican girl.  You look like Rosie Perez.  Before us today.  What?  Today, this afternoon,  the Senate will pass  its budget  that we believe  addresses  the economic crisis  in a way  that rejects  new taxes.  All right.  I thought it was  the Spitzer crap.  No.  When Spitzer comes on,  they're going to...  Yeah.  You'll know it.  Oh. 
[03:39:00]  Bobby's bad.  I went down  to Navajo Valley,  southern Utah.  A place called  the Valley of the Gods.  Yes.  Oh.  As far as you can see  are these  rock formations going on.  Watch you on the  Valley of the Gods,  Buddha.  Bobby, what's wrong?  You all right?  He's acting.  The back of my neck hurts.  See if he's  holding up that head.  I'm certainly not  from the brains inside.  Your fucking back  and your neck  should be airy 
[03:39:30]  and fucking  stretch-free  pulling up a walnut.  A fucking hollow coconut  with a fucking walnut  hanging in there.  What are you going to do?  I knew you were going to say  what are you going to do.  What are you going to do?  Was this on video  or released anywhere?  Yeah, this is actually  big in fucking  I think Taiwan  or some shit.  No, it wasn't.  Really?  Yeah, they redid the cover  and made it  it was supposed to be  one of those  Better Actors. 
[03:40:00]  What'd you say?  Better Actors.  I wish they did.  As far as you can see  are these  rock formations  growing hundreds of feet  right up out of the ground.  We're all made  of this red sandstone  so at night  when the sun starts to set  it's like the whole  valley is on fire,  Allison.  Oh, God.  What emotion  you put into that.  I like a fucking  watered-down pony boy.  It's exactly what you're like.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:40:30]  If you're looking for God,  that's where you're finally.  If it's so amazing,  why'd you come back?  I mean,  it can be so depressing  around here,  don't you think?  Same old places,  same old faces.  Dylan,  it doesn't matter.  That's it.  Just glad you're here.  That's it.  Allison!  I need you in here! 
[03:41:00]  Go to the, uh...  I better go.  Hey, Allison.  I miss you.  All right, Bobby.  Wow.  We like to do  time machine bits  on this show.  Yeah?  If you had the chance  to go in a time machine  and talk to this  Bob Kelly,  what would you do to him?  I would say, uh...  Try emoting a little  when you act. 
[03:41:30]  I would try.  I've heard fucking  blimpy subs ordered  with more fucking  passion and range.  Fucking asshole.  Please don't just make  faces of the emotion.  Angry.  Oh.  Sad.  Oh.  You might want to try it.  Trumpy.  Hee.  If you're looking for God,  here's where you'll find him.  Really?  State your, uh,  state your floor.  We have bras  on, uh,  floor three  and bathing suits  on the fourth floor.  And, uh,  when you're looking for God,  here's where you go.  There's sandstone, Alice.  There sure is sandstone.  You know what, Alice? 
[03:42:00]  I missed you, Alice.  One level.  It's all I do.  I'm the same guy  at all moments, Alice.  There's a little...  There's actually one  with some emotion in it  where I tell her I love her.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Is it nausea from the audience?  Hey, is it true  that Hunger Strike  is being played  in the background  of that scene?  I don't know.  Someone is suggesting  that Hunger Strike  is playing in the background  of that scene.  I love you, Alice.  I missed you.  You'd never know it  to talk to me.  You'd have to read it  in the script  to know I missed you.  Oh, yeah, that wasn't... 
[03:42:30]  On the Inside Track.  I'm hearing, uh,  we didn't even  call out an attack,  but, uh,  the listeners have  taken it upon themselves  to go after the manatees today.  And on the BostonHerald.com, uh,  Inside Track website, I guess,  uh, they're just commenting  about that dumb story  they ran today  in the Inside Track.  ONA aren't going anywhere...  Anywhere...  Anyway?  ONA aren't going anyway,  see cows?  Someone told me to read this,  but now I'm, uh...  No?  It's all right.  All right, fuck it. 
[03:43:00]  Fuck it.  They're having fun  with the, uh...  Thank you.  The Inside Track.  Good.  What are you doing?  I'm borrowing 100 bucks  from Boston.  He goes,  are you going to rip it up?  I'm like, no.  Who am I fucking?  Michael Milken?  At least he just busted  a stereotype before.  Somebody get me a napkin.  I just spilled coffee  on the console.  All right, it's obvious  it's time for line of the day.  Yep.  Line of the day.  Uh, brought to you  by BodogFantasySports.net.  They've got, uh,  one million dollars  up for grabs  in the Bodog Bracket Buster game.  If you think you know 
[03:43:30]  college basketball,  head over to  BodogFantasySports.net.  Here is a runner-up  line of the day.  Is Dolph Sweet body?  He's a fucking...  He really does.  Dolph Sweet.  Him and Patricia's  remake,  give me a break.  Right on to the next one.  Have you noticed  around 50 women  just say,  they stop dying it?  We've talked about that.  Yeah, they start looking  like your best friend, man.  Yeah, they look like 
[03:44:00]  they pitch for the Yankees  in 1978.  Part the hair down the side.  Fucking cunts.  You gotta add that in.  Rich Voss at, uh,  Stress Factory.  Oh, yeah.  Starting Thursday?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday,  Stress Factory.  Thursday, Friday.  New Brunswick, New Jersey?  Will you stop  farting in my face?  732-545.  Ha ha.  Very good.  Here's another  runner-up line of the day.  Guys, please. 
[03:44:30]  Any of you guys  that don't appreciate  where my money went,  you stand up.  All right,  McGreevy, sit down.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  He squeezes her face  like a horse.  Look at this mouth.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  He starts, like,  feeling her gums  and her teeth.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Finally, the last.  That was a shared one.  Runner-up line of the day.  Book, but they sell guns  and Target.  It won't be in Target.  They won't sell. 
[03:45:00]  It's mind-boggling  how they have to sell.  They should sell his CD  because then you'll go  buy a gun.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Whoa.  Whoa, Rich.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Coming back.  Now, Rich, don't say  another word.  Take your headphones off  and walk out the door.  Yeah.  Because that's the last thing  the listeners are going  to remember.  Don't even say.  Trust me on this one.  Take it.  There you go.  Put your coat on.  Yeah.  Don't even say goodbye  because you'll fuck that up.  Put that fucking,  that fucking,  in Irish cheddar-haired coat. 
[03:45:30]  And finally,  with that,  with Rich Voss leaving,  here is your line of the day.  Here comes  line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Here's why he doesn't  want to fuck her anymore.  Because she's had  a third of a baseball team  much out of her country.  Ha ha ha.  Do you realize  the fucking outfield  popped out of her box already? 
[03:46:00]  She really does.  Why would he want that?  She has fat kidroids  coming out of her asshole.  That's why she,  he wants to eat an asshole  that doesn't have  lumps on it.  He has to worry about it  popping like pomegranate seeds.  Fuck her.  Oh, shit.  Fa la la la la,  la la la la la.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Hey,  Jake in Missouri  is reminding us  of something.  Yes,  Jake.  Hey,  Bobby owes Voss  a hundred bucks.  That's how terrible 
[03:46:30]  a Jew Voss is.  He can't even remember  to get his money from him.  I'm not here.  No,  well,  he,  we actually,  he owed me dinner  from a thing,  so we did a trade-off.  Bob owes you a hundred dollars.  No,  he owed me a hundred dollars.  Because Bob said  if anyone comes in  with a baby,  a baby diaper,  he'll give a hundred dollars  to that person.  I told Bobby,  Bobby one time  was working at Caroline's,  I said,  if you get more than 50 people  in,  I'll buy you dinner.  So 51 people showed up.  51 people showed up.  He was counting himself  twice though.  What? 
[03:47:00]  But no,  so we called it even,  but that's a big dinner.  It's a hundred dollars dinner.  Did you just do a math joke?  Whatever.  Yeah,  line of the day,  just walk out.  Yeah,  he couldn't do it.  Oh,  fuck,  I love you guys,  man.  You know,  I'm sorry,  you know,  I'm not going to lie,  I wasn't on my game today.  Don't play on our emotions,  asshole.  Fuck you.  Exactly,  we don't love you.  Yeah,  we don't.  We would have if you  didn't fucking kill our Lord.  Yeah,  we're not a happy family,  fucking faggot.  Beat it.  I hate Bobby with confidence. 
[03:47:30]  It's not me with confidence,  it's you without confidence today.  Yeah.  Sorry,  I just want to,  I apologize.  Let it go.  What's wrong with you?  Exactly,  you fucking worm.  You all right?  You okay?  No.  What's wrong?  Well,  because I'm just not up to par today.  You almost said not funny,  but you said up to par.  You got tears in your eye.  I have no tears in my eye.  You got a little glassy eye.  You're right?  I feel bad.  I feel like I let you guys down.  Oh,  don't worry about it.  You do it all the time. 
[03:48:00]  Tomorrow,  we got Michael K.  Williams over 8 o'clock.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  Omar.  And April 8th,  my CD DVD comes out.  That's right.  That's right.  And if I sell 30,000 copies,  I get to kick the president  of Comedy Central Records  in the nuts.  Oh,  yeah.  It's nice to know  he'll probably have  a 28,000 fucking cushion.  It's just mean,  Jimmy.  It's a CD and a DVD.  You're supposed to help me  sell shit,  you asshole.  Are they the same?  Is the CD and a DVD? 
[03:48:30]  Are they separate?  It's two.  It's a CD,  50 minutes,  and then it's a DVD.  The half hour special  is on it.  And a 45 minute documentary.  I did little jimmies in it  being very mean to me.  Yeah?  Very mean.  Very mean.  All right.  We're out of here.  Colin,  Dane.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Fun show.  Now,  we all know  that Opie and Anthony  Wow Stickers  are your tickets  to seeing some  beautiful bosoms.  Well,  yeah.  Did you know  that Wow Stickers  have many other uses?
