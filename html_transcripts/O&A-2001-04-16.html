<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with a somber tone, playing "I Want to Be Sedated" by the Ramones following Joey Ramone's death, then transitioning to U2's "In a Little While," the song played at his passing.  The hosts and callers debate appropriate "exit music," with suggestions ranging from the expected to the shocking, including Nirvana's "Rape Me."  A caller, Dylan, brings up Opie's past interactions with Joey Ramone on the Ron and Fez show, and another mentions the supposed "Opie curse" in relation to Ramone's death.  Discussions also touch upon *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* and a personal anecdote about meeting Joey Ramone.  Ben is absent due to jury duty.  A significant portion details a chaotic incident at a Dice Clay concert where a heavily intoxicated woman with a Joe Dirt-style mullet disrupted the show, culminating in her spitting on several audience members and subsequent ejection, recounted with graphic detail and offensive language. Multiple callers corroborate this story.

The show then transitions to discussions about *The Sopranos*, with callers and hosts analyzing scenes, characters (particularly Tony Soprano's eating habits), and storylines, frequently using vulgar and offensive language. The "Joe Dirt" woman from the concert becomes a recurring joke, alongside a caller's repetitive use of "Do you have a problem, sister?".

The next segment shifts to Anthony's eating habits while filming, the etiquette of pointing out boogers, and a listener, Abigail, who has a countdown to her 18th birthday. This sparks a discussion about the legality of photographing nude minors and sexual activity with minors.  The conversation jumps to listener Natalie searching for "wow stickers" along Route 3, leading to complaints about Long Island traffic and absurd proposed solutions, including nuclear blasts and tiered highways.  This is followed by calls offering equally outlandish solutions, an SNL skit discussion, a morbid population control joke, and more Long Island traffic woes, concluding with speculation about the island's evacuation in a disaster.  Ben calls in, recounting a conflict with a listener named Jesse.  Bella calls in, leading to a commercial break featuring Stacker 2, Planet Java, and Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Dave from Monster Magnet then joins, discussing his upcoming Long Island show, seedy hotels, the legal issues surrounding photographing a 17-year-old, his past drug use, and his views on the music industry. Abigail returns to the studio, participating in further discussions about the legality of activities involving minors, and a link to topless photos of Anna Kournikova is mentioned.  The segment ends with more banter and plugs.

A subsequent segment centers around Bella, a caller who hasn't had sex with her husband in three years.  The hosts engage in highly sexually explicit questioning, offering to arrange a "banging" for her with multiple men, including a limousine and group sex.  Multiple male callers volunteer their services. Bella expresses some interest but remains hesitant.  The conversation features extensive use of sexual innuendo. This is interwoven with the hosts' anger toward their radio station management, citing censorship, conflicts with unspecified individuals ("Abercrombie and Fitch midget"), and pressure from record companies regarding musical guests. They express their frustration with being "muzzled" and allude to an off-air phone call to confront management.  A listener points out the illegality of adultery in New York, which is dismissed. A brief Rockaway Bedding advertisement and a short appearance by Stockbroker Dave occur.

The final segment discusses inflatable Titanic bounce houses, leading to jokes about morbidly themed inflatables like a Hindenburg ride and a Holocaust-themed disco.  Jim calls in about seeing the Titanic inflatable at a children's party.  A significant portion focuses on a call from Chuck, whose 17-year-old daughter, Abigail, is also in the studio.  Chuck discusses his daughters' sex lives with surprising openness, including plans for Abigail's 18th birthday and his relationships with his daughters, prompting varied reactions from callers. Abigail participates, appearing uncomfortable at times. Dice calls in, recounting a fan spitting on Rick and his wife at a recent event, and the segment ends with callers sharing their takeaways, promotional information for upcoming Monster Magnet and Buckcherry concerts, and more banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Radio is a commercial business, and you have to do what people want.  Oh, what a crap.  We don't do traffic, we don't do weather, we do nothing.  Did you just stay here and talk a little bit?  That's it. It's like the birth radio on the planet.  Yes, we know.  Oldie and Anthony's show. We're so late.  Ben getting credit for those two songs, Anthony.  I know, and Ben, uh, not even here today.  Ben's not here. Ben's in, uh, Jury Duty. 
[00:00:30]  I picked out those two tunes.  I did it all myself.  One again.  That was messed up, hearing that Joey Ramone died.  Yeah, it was really messed up.  So we played I Want to Be Sedated, and off U2's latest CD, we played In a Little While.  The reason for that, in case you didn't read the paper today,  that was the song they played as Joey died in the hospital.  Yeah, like right when the song was over, I guess, uh, so was Joey. 
[00:01:00]  That was it.  Kind of morbid.  I don't think that's the song I want to check out, too, but okay.  All right, what song are you on, Chip?  I don't know.  Well, I'd have to think about it.  Something blasting as you go in a fiery crash into a bridge, a buttman.  Yeah, it would have to be a little louder, sure.  Yeah.  Well, when you're in the hospital, I guess you always pick those, uh, mellow songs.  Maybe Rape Me by Nirvana.  Oh.  I don't think Joey picked it.  From what I hear, he's pretty, uh, pretty sedated. 
[00:01:30]  No pun.  And, uh, well, he was.  He was very sedated, yeah.  All right, well, that's a great way to start the show.  Yeah.  With a death dedication.  God damn death dedication.  Hi.  Mark, what's going on?  212-757-1027, by the way.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  I just wanted to call and say that that was good, man, playing that song first.  What, I want to be sedated? 
[00:02:00]  You got it.  Yeah, we'll play a few more Ramones songs today, I guess.  Yeah, man, I tell you, I was laying in bed last night.  I had MTV.  I was flipping through the channels.  I saw that.  I said, whoa.  I know.  I was like, some guy named Jeff died.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jeff Hyman.  Jeff Hyman.  Jeff Hyman.  Jeff Hyman.  I don't know any Jeff Hymans.  Nah.  Joey Ramones' name.  Yep, yep.  All right, Mark Hyman.  All right, take it easy, guys.  You suck.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dylan.  Dylan, what's going on?  Dylan.  Okay, I got a question for you.  Yes.  You know, seeing as, like, Joey Ramone, like, die, aren't you, like, a little bit remorseful 
[00:02:30]  for, like, making him cry?  How did I make Joey Ramone cry?  When he was at the same Dominator's thing.  It's an Oscar reference, asshole.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  The Ron and Fez show that was replayed on a Friday, I believe.  And I got one more question.  Uh-huh.  All right, I was listening to the Ron and Fez again, and I know all the crap I was calling  her before about Angelina, I wanted to bang her, and all the stuff you said, um, I don't  know.  She sounds pretty hot.  So is there any chance I could bang her?  Well, go ask her. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, I don't know her.  That's why I'm calling you.  I don't know her.  I've been connected to this broad for the last eight months.  Enough with the Angelina crap.  Go find your own hose bag.  Go on the message board.  She's probably there.  She's on it, like, 18 hours a day.  Go pick her up.  Give her a bang.  All right, Dylan.  You got some great stalkers, Opie.  And you don't?  I have one.  You got a few.  Yeah, well.  Oscar, what's going on?  Yeah, big props out to Ben, man.  That was a fat shout-out.  But the Opie curse continues, man.  Yo, you mentioned Joey Ramone on Friday, and now he's dead. 
[00:03:30]  Cut it out, Opie.  Don't mention my name.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Bye.  All right, bye.  I know that doesn't mean we can do mornings now.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Dude!  What's up, Mike?  You remember Fast Times Ridgemont High?  Of course.  The song he tells him to play when he takes her out on the date?  Zeppelin, Side B, first song.  That's the song I want to go out to, bro.  But that's not what you...  It's not Side B. 
[00:04:00]  Whatever.  Hey, Opie, Opie, you still biting Buck's mouth?  What?  What?  I'll play with you.  I don't even know what you said.  If you're going to call up to insult or say something, at least make sure we heard it.  Opie, at least I bite that.  Do I bite books?  Bite books?  Is that what he said?  That's what I heard.  Yeah, I bite books.  Whatever that means.  You book biter?  Sure, why not?  I bite books.  Opie, that's my book. 
[00:04:30]  He felt like he had to say something because the first part of his phone call sucked.  Right.  Because he didn't know what he was talking about with Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  I guess.  Cashmere's not even on that album that Ramon was talking about.  Jiminy Cricket.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's up?  I want to talk about Joey because he was really, really nice to me when I was about 12 years old.  I went to school with his cousin, his younger cousin, and he invited me over because he knew I was this little punk kid. 
[00:05:00]  They're like the Ramones for Passover Seder.  So I celebrated the High Holy Days with the great Joey Ramone.  All right.  Is that it?  That's pretty much it, yeah.  But I want to go to the Buck Cherry Show tonight, too.  There's tickets still available.  Yeah, but I want to hang out in the Skybox and meet the bands with you guys.  Do we still have tickets for that?  All right, hold on.  If we have a pair laying around, we'll give it to you, all right?  Yeah, I want to be in the Opie and Anthony Skybox.  Maybe some XFL cheerleaders can show up.  He sounds like a smartass.  Dave, you're being a smartass? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I'm no smartass.  I just want to go see the show.  I don't think you really want to go.  Yeah, because people really want to hang out in that Skybox just because it's a cool place to see the show.  No, I want free beer.  Come on.  See, I don't like this guy.  I want free beer and I want to meet Buck Cherry.  Wow, that's giving me the thumbs down on you.  I don't like you.  You sound like you're ready to be a big smartass about something.  I'm not going to be a smartass.  I promise.  No, no, no.  Just a total of saying now.  We don't know if you're kidding or not.  Nope.  No, I'm really not kidding.  I swear.  But it was great when the guy in The Sopranos died on the toilet.  I thought that was excellent. 
[00:06:00]  Stinky!  Last night, you didn't watch the show?  Yeah, we did.  Stinky.  When he died on the toilet.  It's an Odell, this Presley, you know.  Relax.  All right.  Dave.  Yeah?  Stinky has some words for you.  Stink?  Okay.  There are no tickets for you.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  And that's because we ran out, if Dave's still listening.  John, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  That clip finally came in handy.  I love that Willy Wonka clip. 
[00:06:30]  What's up, John?  Yo, what's up?  Calvertier, guys.  Yeah.  Hey, aren't you a little upset that Joey Ramone's twin brother didn't die, if you know what I mean?  When was Joey?  I'm trying to think.  Was there another Hyman brother?  Yeah, Joey does have a twin, and he's still alive, yes.  No, that's unfortunate.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Let's move on to Liz.  Liz, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  I saw you at the Dice Clay concert on Saturday.  At Westbury Music Fair.  Yes.  Yes.  You were looking very cute, by the way, Opie.  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  What was up with the girl in front of you that was taping the show when she got thrown out and spit at you?  I didn't think anyone noticed that.  I noticed.  Only about 1,000 people turned around while that whole thing was going on.  I missed this.  You were gone.  Where'd you go?  And left early.  I had to be somewhere.  And he missed the fireworks.  That was, oh, God.  That was too, that was funnier than the show itself, by the way.  I thought Dice was really good.  Did you?  Yes, I really did.  I thought Jim Norton was a lot better.  Jim Norton killed. 
[00:07:30]  Dice was really good.  I'm telling you, that's a good room for him, that in-the-round stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like the old bikes better.  That's cool.  No, he did a lot of the old, whatever.  I mean, I'm not going to try to convince you.  Cool.  All right, Luke.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  Didn't you like his big superhero outfit when he came out?  And that leather jacket and those huge pants?  That looked like a gigantor Transformer.  I saw the superhero without his cape and, oof.  Oh, really?  Not a pretty scene. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, he pretty much had an after-hours party in his room after the show.  There was like 12 of us.  Before the show, I went into his dressing room.  And I'm like, hey, yeah, break a leg there, Dice.  You know, have fun, whatever.  He's like, I don't know if I could do this.  I'm tired.  Guy, I think you'll muster up the energy.  No, no, I'm really tired.  What are you going to do?  Cancel the show?  I'm thinking.  I don't know.  He's always got to be like a...  It's funny you say that because I was talking to Norton. 
[00:08:30]  We were hanging out at that Club Blue that Kimmy turned us on to in the Garden City Hotel.  Big hi to the whole staff there.  And Norton and I were hanging and having a couple of drinks before we went upstairs.  It was like an after-hours party.  Yeah.  And he was telling me the exact same thing.  Every show, maybe we could get Norton on the phone.  Every show, Dice has something going on.  What?  Jesse, what were you just doing?  You were just goofing on Ophie, weren't you?  Why are you goofing on him?  You were saying, yeah, it was an after-hours party at Garden City Hotel.  So he does this. 
[00:09:00]  He does like this move.  Like he swings his head back and forth and starts snapping his fingers.  Like, hey, look who I am.  Jesse, do you really want to go?  No, I don't.  He's still doing it.  I figured, let me throw a mash under this can of gasoline.  You want to compare coolness?  Why?  What are you going to say?  Nothing.  I'm not even going to play.  It was razzin'.  No, I wish I could go to an after-hours party.  I'll work on the list, but maybe someone will invite you.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:09:30]  Dick.  Whoa.  Anyway.  Ah!  If we can get Norton on the phone, Ant.  Yeah.  He says the same thing.  Before every show, Dice has some problem.  Whether it's like his back hurts, his neck hurts.  Yeah, he's always got something happening.  Some kind of anxiety.  I'm dying over here.  And then they announce him, and then he's fine.  He comes out.  You see him walking down like he was Muhammad Ali, making his way to the ring?  Yeah, I know. 
[00:10:00]  He's a lot bigger than he used to be.  Just playing it out.  Well, his leather coats are huge.  Yeah, his jacket's big.  It's huge.  He's got all the studs on it.  Walks down, and it just goes off.  More rank and disgusting than I think he even was back in the day.  You know what I mean?  There's old couples there, which I still...  You know, you realize Dice came out, what, 85, somewhere around there?  So there are people that... 
[00:10:30]  There are old people that were into Dice back then that go to his shows now.  Right.  So you're seeing a guy there, he's in his mid-50s, even, you know, 60.  Who's 60?  Oh.  I saw some people there in their 60s.  Yeah, they probably saw Dice for the first time when they were, what, like 45?  Yeah, you know, around there.  And he just starts, you know, hey, how is her, uh, so you bang that?  And it's, oh my God, he's ragging on old people.  But, uh, I heard more actions in the, uh, in the stands. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, where's Rick?  After I left.  Should we tell this story that about 500 people saw?  Minimum?  Our whole section, our whole piece of the pie of the, of the round saw this.  Well, you could, you could, I'm so distracted by this douchebag.  Uh-oh.  What happened now?  Dude, you're not making friends, you know that, right?  Yeah, so I realized.  Just leave, so we can do our show. 
[00:11:30]  Uh-oh.  Whatever you, whatever stupid thing you're doing, do it outside.  Wow.  So distracted.  Bye.  I need to wind this on top of it.  You can tell me what's cool.  He snapped his fingers because I went to an after-hours party, Rick.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  What a tool.  Just drives me nuts. 
[00:12:00]  I wish Ben was here.  Ben would lose it on him right now for me.  So I don't look like the dick.  Okay.  Terrific.  Which I'm sure I look like now, but whatever.  Anyway, uh, we gotta talk about, uh, Joe Dirt, who was sitting in front of us.  This woman was the most annoying person in the audience.  So you can start the story, and then I'll tell you what happened after you left, Anthony.  Yeah.  It got really good.  I was there, uh, and, uh, about a row in front of, uh, you guys.  Was she the next row?  Yeah, she was a row in front of us, and you were sitting right behind. 
[00:12:30]  I was right behind you guys.  And, uh, first thing, she's, she's taking pictures, and she's standing up.  During Norton, even.  Right.  And people behind her are annoyed.  It's Westbury.  Sit your ass down.  No one stands up during the show at Westbury.  No one made it worse.  She was completely hammered.  Yeah.  If it was, like, a fan, and they're trying to get pictures and stuff, you give them the slack.  Like, okay, whatever.  They're excited to be there.  It's cool, you know?  Picture this, um, this, uh, like, skinny, ridden, hard, and put-up wet blonde that's got, like, 
[00:13:00]  she's really weathered.  Yeah.  And old.  Like, and just.  Heavy-duty pop marks all over her face.  Yeah, and she's just like, ah, and got the raspy voice.  And her hair, get this.  She had this bleached, like, like, straw hair, because it had been, like, bleached so badly  over the years, uh, in an attempt to look younger, I guess, and it was cut in, I swear  to you, exactly like the Joe Dirt mullet.  Exactly.  It looked like clown hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was, like, fake. 
[00:13:30]  It was crispy.  I don't know.  Joe Dirt hairdo, to a T.  And she's standing up, taking pictures, and she's got one of these, uh, digital cameras  that have the little screen on the back so you can see what picture you're taking.  So I'm looking, she can get the same picture sitting in her seat as she can standing up.  Because there's no one in front of you at Westbury.  See, you just take the picture.  And she's standing up.  So that was annoying enough.  Then Dice comes on.  Now she reaches uber annoying. 
[00:14:00]  She's standing up, she's taking pictures, and she's yelling to Dice.  Andrew!  Andrew!  Andrew, turn around!  Andrew!  Andrew!  Andrew!  And Dice at one point just, shut up, you bitch!  And the whole place went nuts.  Yeah.  Because it was just an annoying, disgusting piece of crap.  She bothered probably half of the audience there.  Yeah.  Easily.  And then she gets out of her seat and goes all the way down the front row to get more pictures.  And then the security guards go down to get her.  Because she's standing up from, like, the front row and now blocking a whole other section. 
[00:14:30]  And the security guards have to get her out of there.  And she's just, like, she's ignoring them and she won't go back to her seat.  So they finally get her back to her seat.  And now she's cursing the security guards up and down, up and down, up and down.  And now continues to take more pictures.  Uh-huh.  This is after you left, Anthony.  Just a bitch.  The whole section was just so annoyed.  And she was screaming once again, you know, Andrew, turn around, Andrew, turn around.  And she's saying, like, lines.  And she thinks she's funny. 
[00:15:00]  You know, like, Dice will say, yeah, so, I'm, uh, this chick is sucking my, uh, and she's like, uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, sucking.  Shut up.  Right.  And pay to see Joe Dirt tell the jokes.  So then a couple guys sitting to Rick's right.  Yeah, there were four guys.  This is how it started, right?  Yeah.  The four guys, and they were really nice and polite.  They weren't even trying to cause trouble.  They asked her to shut up, basically.  They said, please be quiet.  They didn't even do that.  You know, she kept looking back.  She kept looking around, like, you know, oh, did you hear what he said? 
[00:15:30]  He told me to shut up.  For five minutes, she was on Dice told me to shut up to the guy sitting next to her who she was with.  Right, but then the guys to your right said something like.  Right, they just went, shh.  Right, right.  And all of a sudden, that's right, it was the shit.  So all of a sudden, Joe Dirt keeps turning to her husband or boyfriend that was pretty pathetic,  would not talk up whatsoever.  This girl, like, runs the family easily.  She wears the pants in this, uh, relationship.  Oh, this poor guy.  Yeah.  He's just a dopey ass who's sitting there totally emasculated by this piece of crap annoying Joe Dirt. 
[00:16:00]  Right, so the guys to your right go, shh, because they want to hear the rest of the show.  Right.  Dice's butt is facing us, and she wants, you know, him to turn around so she can get the fine face shot of Dice, okay?  Right.  And so the guys go, shh.  So now, like you said, for ten straight minutes, at least, over and over again, so the guy she's sitting with, she's like, you hear that?  You hear that?  They said, shh, because they're a bunch of faggots.  They just want to look at Andrew Dice Clay's A-hole. 
[00:16:30]  Bunch of faggots, I tell you.  Shhh.  You hear that?  Over and over and over and over and over again.  And then she's...  A bunch of faggots sitting right behind me.  They want to just see Dice's A-hole, his butt.  Right.  And now she's turning it up a level, because now I was doing all that stuff.  I was surprised it was good.  A bunch of faggots.  Yeah, I was surprised they didn't take a swipe back.  Yeah, because it was brutal.  I mean, over and over again.  She wouldn't stop.  And then she turns like...  You guys are a bunch of faggots.  You just want to see Dice's A-hole.  Yeah.  Faggots. 
[00:17:00]  I'm like, holy.  So I finally had it.  And I'm sitting right behind Rick and Linda.  Right.  I mean, right behind Rick's wife.  And I just go as loud as I could to get her attention.  I go, how many times are you going to say that?  Oh, no.  Because she at least said it.  Seriously.  Seriously.  How many times did she say it, Rick?  And she had...  It was 10 minutes.  It was 100 times.  Over and over.  Oh, my God.  Without exaggerating, it had to be 20 times.  Over and over again.  Over and over and over.  So then she turns around and thinks that Rick's wife said... 
[00:17:30]  How many times are you going to say that?  And goes...  Did you say it in your Boston radio voiceover?  No, no, no.  Turns around to Rick's wife and goes,  Do you have a problem, sister?  Sister.  Sister.  Which is lingo.  I guess the hottest lingo in the trailer park community...  Well, yeah.  If you're in the trailer park,  Hey, sister.  Do you have a problem, sister?  I cannot tell you how many times this weekend I remembered that line in my head 
[00:18:00]  and just started laughing out loud to myself.  Because it was so funny.  Do you have a problem, sister?  So Linda's annoyed, just as annoyed as everybody is.  Everybody around here is annoyed.  And she just goes,  As a matter of fact, yes, I do.  Uh-oh.  Now it's percolating.  Now it's...  Now it's...  Now let's look who's involved.  The faggots?  Right.  Joe Dirk?  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Linda.  Right.  Are now involved in this little thing that's going on.  No, plus at least 100 people behind us.  No, but I mean now they're involved.  Now you're involved. 
[00:18:30]  You've communicated.  You've made contact.  Now she stands up and is now in Rick's wife's face.  She stood up.  Oh, yeah.  And turned right around.  You got a problem, sister?  Like, she wants to go.  She wants to throw.  Right.  Sit down, twat.  She wants to throw.  And so Rick's wife said yes.  As a matter of fact, I do, whatever.  God, I wish I was there.  Yeah.  I wish you were there, too.  Son of a bitch.  I'm laughing so hard because the whole scene is so surreal.  Then Rick turns to...  I get up into her face and go, best line ever. 
[00:19:00]  And I say, yo, shut the F up and sit down, Joe Dirk.  I called her Joe Dirk to her face.  Nice.  I called her Joe Dirk to her face.  Because that's what everyone was saying.  Like, you heard the mumbling and stuff?  It's like, Joe Dirk, Joe Dirk, Heather, Joe Dirk.  She had a mullet.  At this point, I forgot his name.  He's a great security guard at Westbury Music Fair.  I look up.  He can see there's some kind of commotion.  Something happening.  And he gives me the look like, are you guys okay?  And I just went like this, and...  Uh-oh.  You shake the head like, here's a problem. 
[00:19:30]  Here's a problem.  Security guards from all directions come down to Joe Dirk.  Now they're trying to get her out of her seat and get her out of the place, or at least to try to calm her down.  At this point, I don't think they were throwing her out.  They just wanted her to calm down.  Did you see the security had to deal with her earlier when she got up, got in the aisle, went stage side, yeah, and started snapping pictures.  And I saw Happy Face over to my left.  Because any movement near the stage, Happy Face just goes, oh, and looks at it.  Right.  And I saw him get up. 
[00:20:00]  He's a trained killer, you know.  I know.  And I was hoping he would come over.  And he had security take her away.  So this time, now, security starts wrestling her out of her seat.  Wrestling.  And then, like, her husband or boyfriend, whatever, gets up.  No problems.  The worm.  Doesn't even say a word to anyone.  He's like, oh, bastard.  Right.  It was almost like, oh, I've been through this before.  It looks like he has a problem wherever he goes with this girl.  She's in battle mode.  So now she's going, whatever his name is, Henry, we're not going anywhere.  Sit down.  Right.  And continues sitting back down and trying to enjoy the concert and taking pictures. 
[00:20:30]  Henry, sit down.  So he's like, oh, okay.  And he sits back down.  Then the security guard grabs him again.  He starts walking out with the, you know, him.  This was the ultimate pussy whipped guy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, and then starts grabbing Joe Dirt again.  And she refuses to go.  Oh, she keeps breaking loose and sitting back down.  Finally, they use a little force to get her up and out.  Right.  Did she say, why don't you speak into the mic?  I have a backup mic, too.  Like Joe Dirt in the commercials. 
[00:21:00]  Now, this is where it gets pretty good.  So it's obvious they got a good hold of her and they're dragging her out.  That's when, that's when, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Okay.  Kimmy.  Yeah.  What are you going to say about Kimmy right there?  She's on the line.  Well, no, go ahead.  Kimmy was sitting right next to everybody.  All right.  Well, what I was going to say is when it was obvious they were thrown around at the  joint, I would say at least 100 people started applauding and some people started standing.  Well, that's what I was going to say about Kimmy.  All of a sudden, Kimmy's the first one to just break out.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  Wait, let me get her on the line here.  She is the first one clapping and hooping and hollering.  Kimmy.  Hi.  Of course, now I'm driving.  I'm probably going to cut off because I'm coming up to the dead zone.  That was the funniest thing that whole entire night.  Yeah.  Because she's sitting there and the guy that she was with, he is.  He is just like the biggest loser.  But the best part was when she first sat down and she had the camera, she goes, I hope you  don't mind, but I'm going to be standing up to take pictures, you know?  Yeah, we mind.  Well, she was nice.  She was nice at first.  She said, she said, you know, I'm going to take a few pictures. 
[00:22:00]  We're like, yeah, all right, whatever.  But then she was getting drunk or something was going on and she was a complete mess by  the time Dice was on stage.  It's like she's got like the dirty, greasy bi-level going on in her head.  Yeah, it was the Joe Dirt mullet and she just looked ridden hard and put up wet.  But the best part, when she's getting pulled out there, she's like, I'm not going anywhere.  And like the security guard's pulling her husband and she's pulling him back.  She's going, you're not going anywhere.  And this guy didn't say a word to Joe Dirt or the security. 
[00:22:30]  He was like a rag doll.  Is it true that you said to the guy, if we were 60 feet underwater, I'd kick your ass?  Yeah.  But the whole thing went on for like 20, 30 minutes.  Like we missed like the whole section of this show.  It had to be at least 15 minutes of this going on.  I'll fill you in on the show.  Dice ragging on chicks' private areas.  And guys wearing beige.  Okay.  Right.  Kimmy, thanks.  We've got to finish this story. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, no, I know.  But I wanted to say hello, goodbye.  And I had a great time.  And enjoy the rest of the show because it was great.  And I'm sorry about Joey and Ramon.  Yeah, that was pretty sad.  Hey, thanks for, you know, hooking us up at that Club Blue.  No problem.  And then I'll see you guys around.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There's Kimmy from Survivor.  So then they're dragging around.  It's obvious that she's gone.  Kimmy starts to chant or whatever, cheering.  Everyone else starts cheering.  A lot of people start stating up.  So Joe Dirk turns to Rick and Linda mostly and just spits. 
[00:23:30]  Spits.  Spits.  Like the animal that she is.  So he spits.  Ugh.  So it got on Rick, Linda, and supposedly part of Kimmy, right?  Oh, my God.  And at this point, Rick bolts from his seat.  Of course.  And I'm like, this girl is so dead.  That in the rules, you can then punch that chick right in the face because she spit on your chick.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  The rules say at that point you can punch her in the face.  Oh, okay.  Especially if she looks like Joe Dirk.  Yeah.  If you look up the rules to punching a girl, yes.  If she's hot, you just take it, you know, unzip and work it.  Say, thanks, honey.  So now they're dragging her up the aisle.  Rick's following.  And I'm like, man, he's just going to kill this chick.  And then I didn't see what happened at that point because you guys went behind the soundboard, I think.  Right.  I hear he had to make the touchdown.  You had to do the ultimate.  Yeah.  I went there with one thing in mind.  I'm like, I'm not going to swing at this person, woman, whatever it is. 
[00:24:30]  Trash.  Right.  White trash.  I'm just going to make sure she gets an earful to take home with her so it will bother her that night, the next morning, and all Easter Sunday.  Rick pulled out the A-bomb.  Yeah.  Called her to see.  Right to her face.  And that's when she tried to swing at you, right?  That's when she swung at me and I stopped her with her hand.  And that's when the guy, the security guy that we can't remember his name, picked her up and just threw her another five feet.  Yeah.  And then at this point, she goes, he grabbed my breast. 
[00:25:00]  I'm calling the cops.  Oh, please.  Trust me, honey.  No one wants to grab your breast.  Cops would have arrested you.  Ugh.  And that was it.  Disgusting.  They threw her out and we enjoyed the rest of the show.  Good.  Good.  You had to know she was going.  Yeah.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  Oh, I stopped three rows right behind you guys.  It was nasty.  It looked like she took a mouthful of beer or soda and just sprayed everybody with it.  There was a lot of spit that came out of that.  Oh.  Most of it missed, but, you know, you get a little bit on you. 
[00:25:30]  That's enough.  Yeah, that's enough.  It's just skeevy enough.  Yeah, it was foul.  It was a spit.  Yeah.  It was real foul.  And I tell you, it's not necessary.  Not necessary at all.  All right, Frank.  Be good.  Bye.  Rich is claiming he was sitting right in front of me, but that can't be possible.  Rich.  Yeah, hi.  Hey.  How you doing?  What's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, how you doing?  I was there also.  We were sitting right in front of you, my wife, my sister, and her husband, and we saw  what was going on.  You guys covered it pretty well, but, you know, an animal. 
[00:26:00]  She was a real animal that was.  Wow.  That was just trash.  I couldn't believe it.  I said, here you are on the show, and she was a pain in the ass all along, all night long.  The whole time, right?  Yeah.  Up until I left, she was a pain.  Hey, Andrew.  You gained a little weight there, Andrew.  You got to get a little stubby.  All right.  What the hell is this all about?  But just to say, Opie, by the way, I thought you don't shake anybody's hands.  I shake everyone's hands.  You shook my hand that night.  You know who my hand was?  Don't even tell me.  Thanks.  I'm only kidding.  You guys are great. 
[00:26:30]  All right, Rich.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye.  A spitting piece of bleached, blonde, mullet-headed trailer trash.  Yep.  Nice.  Tommy.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  So what happened?  Did he hit her?  I don't know.  Rick did not hit her.  He called her the C-word, which I think is even worse.  What did you say?  You walked up and went, you...  Yeah, I wanted to make sure that the security guys weren't going to, like, just calm her down  and then let her back.  Right.  Yeah.  So I went to them.  I'm like, hey, I hope you guys intend to throw this woman out because she just spit at me, 
[00:27:00]  my friend, and my wife.  Yeah.  And she turned and she goes, I didn't spit.  I go, yes, you did, you effing C.  Oh, nice.  Nice.  You know what I would do?  My girlfriend's a little timid.  Like, I would want to definitely punch her, but then it's a girl.  You can't punch her.  I don't know what I would do.  Now, that was like a man.  Hey, behind a soundboard with no one watching, you could punch him.  That was like a man, anyway.  Yeah.  That was like a man.  You wait until security brings her back and brings her to a darkened area, and then you  pop a one in the head.  I'm proud of you guys.  Love you, boys.  Also, I don't know.  I think her head...  She fell down.  Her head hit the doorstop on the way out. 
[00:27:30]  The cinder block fell.  I slipped.  What?  Oh.  She was disgusting.  Now all the Joe Dirt stories are coming in from the show.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, L1A.  Hey.  My wife, I sent out for a beer during the show, and comes back with his puss on her face  with wearing beer.  She almost kicked Joe Dirt's A.  Really?  Yeah.  She knocked into her.  She said she was wasted.  Yeah.  She was all drunk and disgusting.  Yeah.  Really nasty, man. 
[00:28:00]  Really nasty.  Yeah.  All right, Chuck.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  It was fun, though.  And the whole thing about Joe Dirt is that she totally negated the guy who was sitting  a row behind you guys.  Who was annoying, because they were just, like, yapping.  Who was Mr. Explain Every Joke guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, Dice would be telling his jokes, and the guy behind him going, oh, yeah, yeah.  That's a reference Elvis, when Elvis died on the crapper.  Yeah.  I know, buddy.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  I know.  Oh, the big T's.  Yeah, that chick's got the big T's.  And TF. 
[00:28:30]  And, like, just blurting stuff out.  You're like, shut up.  Let Dice do it.  Ah, Sammy.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Listen, I was at the show also Saturday.  I said, right across the stage from you guys.  Okay.  That damn flash kept getting in my wife's eyes and my eyes.  Oh, she took a picture every minute.  She had to take, yeah, at least 50 pictures.  Yeah, she did.  At least.  I was going to walk over there and say, what the hell is going on?  There's a sort of scuffling going on, and up and down, and security.  I says, the hell with that. 
[00:29:00]  It was a show within itself.  Yeah.  But then when they were dragging around, I don't know, the whole back, the row right  behind us, they all cleared out to go check it out.  Yeah, I saw it because, you know, I'm trying to watch the show, listen to the show, then  I'm looking at this.  Yeah.  You know, it was bad.  It was bad.  White trash, white trash.  I don't even know if we're doing the story justice.  It was just such a scene.  Yeah.  Dan from Hoboken saying, I don't understand why someone like Joe Dirt would be at a Dice  show.  She was perfect. 
[00:29:30]  That was Dice's, my God.  Dice's people.  And she's taking the pictures and just screaming, Andrew.  Right.  And then when Dice told her to shut up and turned away, she's like, yeah, you're gaining a little  weight there, aren't you, Dice?  Oh, yeah.  Like under her breath, she's yelling like they have a relationship.  And the worm next to her, how the hell would it be to be that guy?  Just shoot yourself, dude.  Oof.  Shoot yourself.  What are you living for?  Imagine I'm going to go on with that, and you didn't stand up to those sons of bitches.  I had to do it. 
[00:30:00]  You're a pussy.  You've always been a pussy.  Imagine that, going on with that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You know, you started a little.  I started.  Yeah, bend over.  I'm going to give you ten more.  Yeah.  Just straps one on and rails him.  Spits on him.  Spits her putrid Milwaukee's best all over his back.  Milwaukee.  Die.  Milwaukee puke breath.  Oh.  Old Milwaukee puke breath.  Just thinks she's the life of the party. 
[00:30:30]  Well, Rick, I must have thought of that line 12 times over the weekend.  You have a problem, sister?  I think we're going to be hearing that around here a lot.  You have a problem, sister.  You got a problem, sister?  Rick's wife is like the coolest, mellowest person, never speaks up, like just a lady.  Yeah.  Do you have a problem, sister?  And even then, she's sitting there.  She's like, yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.  Yeah.  And I'm looking at Linda like, oh, she's going to get up and she's going to karate chop this chick right in the face. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Linda takes boxing time and all that stuff.  She's not afraid.  Yeah, Linda's a lady, but she'll throw if she has to.  Right.  That would have been so good if she would have just gotten clocked in the head.  Oh.  I thought Rick was going to clock her.  Because then they all start screaming at me, go stop him.  I'm like, it's too late, man.  Rick, you know, when Rick's in that mode, you've got to control.  You've just got to let him go.  All right.  We've got to take our break.  I just had a call to see.  212-757-1027.

[00:33:30]  This right here.  I used to play this in Boston.  Monster Magnet.  Remember the band, Hum?  Oh, Hum.  They had that one song about stars, remember?  Right.  Missed the plane to Mars.  Mars and stuff.  Out there counting stars.  And then we had to find another hit off the album and we came up with The Pod.  That rocks.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[00:34:00]  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on?  Yeah, I wanted to talk about Sopranos last night.  Tell me that show doesn't just get more and more messed up every week.  You got a guy dying on the crapper.  And then Sleeping Guy was great, too.  Sleeping Guy was very funny.  That was funny as hell.  He had more.  You going to get him on?  Yeah, Sleeping Guy.  Knowing us, we'll get Sleeping Guy on our show.  I had more interaction with Tony Sopranos than the other two guys.  You know, helping in the head with a piece of bread and going to sleep on him all night.  I thought Igor said he was going to be in this week's episode. 
[00:34:30]  He lied.  He did lie to us.  He lied.  He better call up and fess up.  Yeah, what did he say?  He said he was going to be driving a cab or something.  And there was no cab in there.  The Russian mobster guy who is a friend of the show.  He said he was going to be on the Sopranos last night.  Yeah, well, at least Turk Pipkin, who was a sleeping guy, by the way.  He goes in with Tony.  The Sopranos.  There are so many great storylines that have been forming the last few weeks.  I just want death and destruction now.  Something to happen.  But nothing ever unfolds.  Well, that's what they do.  They've been setting up and setting up. 
[00:35:00]  What was the last good killing we had?  The hoo-er.  The hoo-er.  Tony, she was a hoo-er.  She was a hoo-er.  A hoo-er.  Guido the Killer Pimp.  I love Guido the Killer Pimp.  Time of your life, eh, Joel?  Risky Business was on, like, every time I was flipping around over the weekend.  I'm like, ah, it's Guido the Killer Pimp.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  And if you catch Goonies, you'll see them in that show.  All right, guys.  I'm going to go make some sandwiches now.  All right.  Sanguiches.  I had some turkey sandwiches. 
[00:35:30]  Sanguiches.  The show was really good.  A lot of great storylines.  But now it's like, okay, let's do something with the storylines.  Yeah.  You know?  And now start getting things rolling.  Although Meadow's turning into quite the little hose bag.  That's kind of cool.  She likes the ex.  She tried the ex for the first time.  She tried the ex.  And then she was passed out a little too much to have sex.  Oh, excuse me, Anthony.  It's E.  Remember, we were corrected last week.  We're not hip.  It's called E now, not X.  Even though on The Sopranos, they called it X. 
[00:36:00]  And I think The Sopranos is a pretty hip, cool show.  So I'll stick with X.  Wow.  When describing ecstasy.  All right.  Dude, it's spelt with an E.  I understand.  Holy smokes.  Never a boring day around here, huh?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, so...  What do you think of that chick?  What?  Tony was banging at the end of the episode.  Oh, the...  Earl came up with a good one.  Yeah, Earl actually had an idea. 
[00:36:30]  That this girl who was hanging out in the waiting room of the shrink when Tony walked in is maybe a fed.  You know, it just seemed a little coincidental that she's there when it's Tony's appointment.  Like, oh, I made a little mistake.  And she, uh, the psychiatrist there, when she goes to her own shrink, was saying, oh, and this girl with her problems.  And they're just these inane, like, not real problems. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  So maybe she's a plant for someone.  See, I just thought it was like she had a problem.  She gets clingy with guys that she dates.  That's what I was thinking.  That's why she's seeing Lorraine Bracco's character.  I mean, Bracco.  Bracco.  Bracco.  Bracco.  Bracco.  And that's going to set up a problem for Tony.  But, no, I think Earl hit it.  Could be a plant of some sort.  Maybe a fed.  I like the fed plant angle.  That's a possibility.  I don't know.  That might be a little, like, entrapment or something.  You know something, though?  Enough of the shrink scenes. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, Tony's seeing a shrink.  I can't take it.  The only thing that redeems those scenes is Tony talking.  Right.  Like, some of the stuff he says is really funny.  But I really, yeah, enough with him sitting in that goddamn office.  We want to see bada bing.  We want to see the guys hanging out.  We want to see there's a problem.  We've got to take care of this problem, Tony.  You know, that's what I like saying.  I think Mr. Walnuts there is not too happy with Tony these days.  Well, I think they're seeing Tony pushing it out a little bit.  Pushing it out is making Mr. Walnuts happy. 
[00:38:00]  Make a decision.  I'm thinking there might be something developing there.  Mm-hmm.  Now, tell everyone how neurotic I am when we're watching The Sopranos again in the back office.  Yeah.  There's something that happens on The Sopranos that I can't take.  Oh, Tony eating.  It moves, it, it, it, yeah, because I told you too, right, Rick?  It freaks me out, though.  Anyone else notice how he just plays with his food in a very strange, weird way?  Yeah.  They're always eating on the show.  Richie's in there.  No one plays with their food as much as Tony does before he takes a bite. 
[00:38:30]  And I go to him, man, look, look, man.  Look at what he's doing.  It drives me absolutely nuts.  Look what he's doing.  He's playing with his food again.  And it's such an obscure, stupid thing that no one else would pick up on.  But it drives me nuts week after week.  Now you're going to laugh.  Next Sunday, you'll watch.  He shuffles the food around a little bit with his fork for us.  Kind of clink, clink, clink.  It's just a weird way.  Like, no one.  Like, he pulls it in, he pulls some food with his fork, and he flicks a little away.  It's called, like, pasta, too.  There's nothing going on there.  And then there's, like, meat, and he'll put it on the fork and then kind of shake the fork 
[00:39:00]  so it's kind of just hanging there, swinging.  It drives me nuts, and I'll tell anyone that wants to listen.  And I'll put it in his mouth, everything else.  There were people over watching The Sopranos last night.  I'm like, look, look, look, what are you doing?  He's eating.  He's just eating.  I'm like, no, look how he plays with his food.  It drives me nuts.  I know I do.  You're not telling me anything I don't know, Rick.  Tommy, what's up?  Hey, Owen, hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey. 
[00:39:30]  Big Sopranos fan.  Paul.  The only thing that pisses me off a little bit the last couple of weeks, I mean, it's  like a soap opera.  Nobody's getting wagged.  The best thing that got wagged in the last two weeks is a Cadillac.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, nobody's getting banged around.  It's starting to become like dynasty.  I need to see a little more action.  You know, like this week coming up, it's got to be somebody, because there's at least  four characters on that show that are ready to get wagged.  There's a lot of hardcore Soprano fans that would talk down you and say, hey, that's not  what the show's about, you know, wagging someone every week. 
[00:40:00]  Well, you know what?  You want to get the audience's attention.  Right.  I think there's enough going on that someone could get wagged, though.  Like, all right, just throw in a little murder.  Throw, you know, you got to kill the rapist off, right?  Well, that's because you're into soap operas.  You got to kill that kind of crap.  You know, you need to see some action, but the average O&A listener is probably the  average Soprano fan.  Tommy, I agree with you.  You need to see something.  I mean, you don't need to be showing enough boobs over at the bada bing anymore.  I don't know about that.  It seems like they're showing lots of boob shots the last few weeks. 
[00:40:30]  And the last two weeks haven't been too much.  All right, Tommy.  All right, guys.  Look at the hottest girls in the background in those bada bing shots, too.  Andrew noticed the same thing about the food.  I noticed that's what it will be.  It's like Tony setting up for a slap shot from the circle playing with that friggin'  posse.  That's what it is.  That's a great way.  Yeah, that's a great observation.  That's good.  It just drives me nuts.  You'll probably see it this coming Sunday.  You're stupid.  Whatever.  They're right.  The only people who call it X are old people and narcs. 
[00:41:00]  It's called E.  Being on E is called rolling.  Like, yo, I'm rolling hard.  All right.  Johnny.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, Ann, I've got to shoot you down.  I don't think she's a planner because then the shrink's got to be in on it.  Well, I'm not saying that she's a fed.  I'm saying maybe some kind of plant for somebody.  And why can't the shrink be in on it?  She knows exactly what Tony does.  It could be.  It could be.  Maybe her conscience is getting to her.  Why would the shrink have to be in on it?  She just makes an appointment with the shrink and shows up during Tony's appointment. 
[00:41:30]  Because the shrink didn't know she didn't schedule her appointment at the same time.  I don't know.  I just thought about it.  I thought about it.  You guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Thank you.  All right.  Someone else say, in no way, Tony's girls are fed.  Corey.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Listen, Tony Soprano showed up at the Mercedes-Benz dealership unexpectedly, and she was working.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  It's kind of an assumption to make that she would.  The feds, I mean, the feds aren't stupid, though.  They're, like, just dangling the bait, knowing he's going to go for it eventually. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  In my opinion, I don't know.  She's a piece of work.  You know, if I were him, I'd be doing it, too.  All right, Corey.  What do you got, man?  Richie thinks we're idiots.  Richie.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Listen, Annabelle Short has got the worst taste in the world.  She goes from Wesley Snipes, then she goes to Fat Tony Soprano.  She's horrible.  Yeah, it's another thing.  Like, what the hell is she doing with Big Fat Tony Soprano?  She's pretty hot, and then she's sleeping with that fat slob?  On a test drive.  And second of all, and second of all, he screwed up. 
[00:42:30]  He's supposed to make nice with Ralphie.  He did.  No, he didn't.  He made him cap up.  He made him cap up, and then refused to have a drink with him.  Yeah, so?  He doesn't even acknowledge him.  He's screwing up.  Well, that's going to be a huge storyline by the end of the season.  Tony's screwing up.  A bunch of people thought he was going to be whacked last time.  I'm like, no way.  This is going to last at least until the end of the season.  All right, fellas, later.  All right.  He's too good.  Yeah.  Guido the killer pip is too good on the Sopranos to whack him off.  I only know him one way. 
[00:43:00]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What is up when he's eating his goddamn food?  He's playing in the place like he's going to hit the floor or something.  Yeah, well, we were just saying that.  I hope he doesn't like that at all.  I know.  He starts shuffling the food around.  I got to shuffle it around a little.  Just shuffle it around a little bit.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, good.  Hello.  Yeah, go.  Hello.  Chris.  Hello.  Not funny, stupid.  Yeah.  Go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How you guys doing? 
[00:43:30]  Goodbye.  What he wanted to say was Meadow laying on the bed.  Yeah.  Meadow laying on the bed was great.  It was.  We almost saw Meadow's bush.  His hand went down her panties.  Almost saw the Meadow.  We got to get.  He's kind of pulling it down.  We got to get Jamie Lynn on the show.  She's turned into quite the little hose bag.  It's nice.  I want to know if that guy had reached patch.  And then she passes out and he takes a look at her chest.  I did that once.  She's just like flop.  She passes out. 
[00:44:00]  I did that once.  And he's like, damn it.  You know, what do I do?  He starts again with the hand down the pants.  Then he's like, I can't do this.  So he just kind of lifts her shirt up and takes a look.  He's like, yeah, yeah, nice.  I'll get to that eventually.  Yeah.  You got to take the peek in that situation, right?  When he's shooting pole with his friends.  Did you F her?  Right.  Did you F her?  She's creaming for me.  Did you F her?  There's going to be some problems.  Going to be some problems.  EJ has a good question on nine.  Why were the Sopranos celebrating Thanksgiving?  Yeah, that was a little strange. 
[00:44:30]  They could have made it like Easter.  Oh.  Well, I guess they got to fit a whole year in a season.  You know what I mean?  You can't like.  I think by the time Thanksgiving rolls around, they're in reruns.  Yeah, I guess.  They kind of get the whole year compressed into.  Yeah, I guess the season did start with like Meadow going off to college,  which would be what, late August, early September.  Saying that the, let's say, the Mercedes dealer chick, a private eye,  hired by Tony's wife.  I don't know if she'd have slept with him. 
[00:45:00]  I think it might be something like family related.  Maybe.  Let's go to Jerome.  Jerome, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, you guys don't understand how Italian he eats.  If that's, you're going to make fun of this guy.  You've got to get everything on the fork before you put it in your mouth.  Don't you understand?  I guess.  You've got to get everything on the fork.  Please don't.  He's collecting more food because you've got to get fat real quick.  All right.  More on the fork than people fat.  Listen, I like what he did, what his face did, with the metal.  That was Mike. 
[00:45:30]  He should have just went all the way there.  He looked right in there.  He got to see everything.  He got to see the movies.  I thought he was going to violate her while she was sleeping.  I'm like, oh, man.  That would have been a problem for Tony, huh?  Yeah, well, Tony would, you know, that would have been bad.  He still got the Mouly incident to deal with.  Right.  You guys do the best.  Take it easy.  They drop a lot of storylines on the Sopranos.  It frustrates me.  Yeah, hopefully.  Some of them come back, I understand.  But it's like, let's, you know, wrap up some of these things nicely.  Michael. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Good.  What's going on?  Opie.  Tony's always playing with his food because when they're filming, he can't keep taking  mouthfuls of food.  So he's got to look like he's doing something with each take because it doesn't happen in  one take.  If he kept eating food with each take, he'd be throwing up in five minutes.  I understand that.  But, you know, I mean, he's not the first person to eat on TV or on a film.  Yeah, plus he's a guinea, though.  That guy who just called that something, too, you know?  Other people seem to, like, you know, fake the eating thing when you're watching a movie  or a TV show. 
[00:46:30]  It's just some petty little thing that drives me nuts.  Yeah, I hear you, man.  All right.  All right.  Later, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Enough on the Sopranos.  Oh, that's it.  I knew it.  What?  Why does Anthony sound like a Labrador retriever?  Huffing and puffing?  No, I got, I got, like, snot in my nose.  I got blown my nose.  I didn't even notice.  I noticed a couple of times I'm talking.  Like, you know, you get the whistle in your nose.  Won't go away.  The whistle's hilarious. 
[00:47:00]  Pshh.  Pshh.  Trying to sleep.  Pshh.  All right.  I'll go grab a goddamn tissue.  That's stuff you see on the train all the time.  I'll just blow a snot rocket.  People, the best is, like, you know, I saw a guy sleeping with the nose whistle.  Yeah.  With a dried up, like, booger just kind of going back and forth on the inside of his nose.  Like, oh, God.  What's the etiquette when you see somebody with a big booger in the nose?  Do you say, do you have a booger in your nose? 
[00:47:30]  Does it have to be somebody you know?  Like, if Rick had something in the nose, right, I'd go, Rick, you got something coming out over there.  Yeah, you just, well, yeah.  You go, hey, Rick, Rick.  But what if it's somebody, like, you don't know the person, you just got to deal with it.  Without a doubt.  Because I can't even then look.  Because I will get sick.  If you see, like, a big snot right in the corner of the nose or something.  Simple.  Someone you know, you just discreetly give them the little signal that something's going on.  Yeah, but shouldn't you tell everybody you see that that's going on? 
[00:48:00]  You would think.  But it's uncomfortable.  Just puts you in a weird position.  What if, you know.  What about a sales guy comes into the office, got something there.  Did you say something?  What if they have bad breath and they're trying to, like, tell you about the Sam Adams reads that are coming up?  Yeah.  That's kind of rough.  Whoa, what happened?  It's kind of rough.  Just an example.  I just pulled it out of the sky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how close do they have to be?  You know, what if a guest comes in?  Well, if they come in here, we'd be like, hey, hey, what's with the snot, you know? 
[00:48:30]  Well, yeah, the rules are different in here, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  We have Abigail here.  Yep.  She's 17 today?  17.  It's her birthday today.  Oh, it was Saturday.  It was on Saturday.  Yeah, so she is 17.  So what kind of legal situation is she in now?  I'm just oral.  Okay.  Just oral.  What?  The famous Abigail who used to send us, like, interesting pictures, and we got a little nervous.  Well, because she was 16. 
[00:49:00]  She was 16.  And they weren't naked pictures.  And there's a countdown clock on foundrymusic.com to her 18th birthday.  Oh, she's 18.  Because I know you cannot photograph a nude girl under 18 years of age.  Right.  Cannot be photographed.  But now she's 17.  Right.  You can be sexually active.  Because I guess she wants to be on the lesbian couch on her 18th birthday.  That's why we're doing the countdown clock on foundrymusic.com.  What is time, though?  Isn't it just a relative thing?  I'm working it.  What is the one more revolution around the sun? 
[00:49:30]  Who cares?  I've been to jail once.  Don't really feel like going back.  You can take the picture.  This whole time thing is just a made-up, man-made scale, divvying up eternity.  So, what is a year?  What about those first nine months for Christ's sake?  Yeah, do you count the first nine months?  I would.  Yeah.  Hey, retro. 
[00:50:00]  That's right.  She is 17 and nine months old.  Yeah.  I wonder if that would work in a court of law.  Hell no.  I wonder if anyone has brought that up before.  Oh, yeah.  Natalie.  Yes.  What's up?  You're on the radio.  Hello.  Hi.  What do you got?  Hello.  Natalie.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I'm driving down Route 3, and I'm countless, and no one has wow stickers.  What's going on here?  You people. 
[00:50:30]  Completely countless.  I have too many, yes.  You're completely countless.  I am.  You have nice boobies there.  Oh, yeah.  How big?  C's.  C's or D's?  D's.  D's.  D's.  You don't have the Joe Dirt mullet, do you?  No, I don't.  Sorry.  Nice.  Do you want to give out your location or no?  I am on Route 3, passing exit Route 7.  Okay.  And you're looking for wow stickers?  I'm looking, and there's none here.  Natalie, do us a favor.  Only flash the guys with the wow stickers. 
[00:51:00]  I'm waiting for them.  And guys, if you haven't gotten a wow sticker yet, you can make a homemade wow sign on your car.  That is okay as well for the ladies, all right?  All right.  Natalie, call us back if anything happens out there.  I will do that.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Why wouldn't you put a wow in your car and just go about your business?  She's waiting for one.  By the way, I apologize that we had no wow stickers to give away at the Dice shows over the weekend.  Someone around here felt like it wasn't really important to, you know, give wow stickers to our core audience. 
[00:51:30]  You would think the Dice show would have been the premier spot to give out wow stickers.  A lot of our audience was at Westbury.  None.  A lot.  Not even a van out front.  Nothing.  Again.  Where was the van Saturday night?  Who was it?  I don't know.  Parked.  Parked.  In the garage?  Parked in the garage.  Yes.  Well, I went out with Jeremy today.  I'm like, whatever.  People are sick of hearing this bitch, but nothing ever changes.  It's the basics of radio. 
[00:52:00]  You get a van out for Dice so you can hand out wow stickers after the show.  Right.  A bunch of people on Long Island would love to get their wow stickers.  Yeah.  Never had the time to try to write down the address and send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  You know, you have them right outside the show.  Boom.  There you go.  You're all set.  Ready to go.  You're at the back show.  Ready for wow season, right?  Right.  But if you want to send in the self-addressed stamped envelope, see, now it's a hassle.  You've got to get a pen and a paper or try to remember this while you're driving.  It's 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106. 
[00:52:30]  And we'll send out the wow stickers.  Okay?  Immediately.  Right.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  All right?  Yeah.  Pour your nose.  You want a little dose of honesty?  You'll find it here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a couple of idiots.  Filthy, disgusting, breezy idiots.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker, two of the world's strongest fat burner.

[00:54:00]  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin, us two a-holes.  Hello.  102.7 WNEW.  Rusty on the instant feedback.  Listening to Opie hypothesized on the plot of The Sopranos is like listening to a three-year-old with Down syndrome reading Einstein. 
[00:54:30]  Friggin' two, uh, three.  Three and a half hours to get home in, uh, holiday traffic last night from exit, uh, 63 of the expressway out on Long Island to Brooklyn.  And in the traffic, you have so much time to ponder, uh, what could fix this.  It's not the roads.  They could, they could pave Long Island, North Shore to South Shore.  You know, just avoid the houses and drive willy-nilly, and there'd still be traffic. 
[00:55:00]  Space cars.  Make your own roads.  Well, we know that ain't coming.  I say, here's another idea I got.  Much harder driving tests.  I know I'll pass.  You know, you gotta weed out the incredibly stupid, the untalented driver, and the old drivers.  You put in, you put in, say, um, and here's the driving test.  Styrofoam trucks.  And they're, there's just enough room for your car to get through. 
[00:55:30]  You gotta thread that needle at, like, 30.  Not even a fast speed.  From lane to lane, like?  No, just once.  Okay.  Just once.  All right.  But you have to be doing 30.  You slow down.  Bam.  No license.  Too complicated.  Because, you know something?  Double parked vehicles around, especially in the city, Brooklyn, people will stop.  They'll just stop.  And you're like, I could get my truck through there.  Can you move?  Come on.  I, I, I got a better idea.  What? 
[00:56:00]  Uh, a little, little.  Yeah.  Nuclear blast.  Yeah.  In Patchogue.  Just take out some people.  Yeah.  It's called thinning the herd.  Thinning the herd.  Happens in the Serengeti all the time.  They have to thin the herd.  Too many gazelles running around.  I don't know.  You, you make, you make it a little tougher.  We're the only creature on this earth that doesn't thin the herd.  Gotta thin the herd every once in a while.  You don't think we do?  Not all the baby turtles are supposed to make it to the ocean.  Yeah.  Need a few seagulls to take, uh, take away a few of the baby turtles. 
[00:56:30]  Pluck them away.  Pluck them away.  What?  I don't know.  We're all high and mighty.  I think they make it too friggin' easy.  Well, do you remember your driver's test?  Hasn't changed.  It's gotten easier.  You don't even have to do anything like, like any maneuvers that you normally have to do to get somewhere fast.  So all these people that can't drive worth a crapper on the road, plug it up.  Put the signs on the road that just say, everyone, hit the gas in three, two, one, boom, we're home. 
[00:57:00]  So you're all in traffic, but you're just going faster.  Right.  Bumper to bumper, 60 miles an hour.  I like that.  I don't care.  Sure, some people will wipe out, but you've got to do something.  Building roads doesn't help.  Roads with, uh, trap doors.  Right.  You're the one that's effing it up.  Poof.  Goodbye.  You're gone.  Gone.  Cameras everywhere.  Road swallows you.  I'd take a pay road.  How about a pay road?  You pay a toll.  It's one highway.  Maybe there's four exits the whole way. 
[00:57:30]  I was reading about that.  There are places that are thinking about that.  Where the privilege will have their own highway.  Yeah.  That pays a lot of the tolls.  I would put a privilege of, uh, you know, having this super highway with a lot less traffic.  If you could get on a super highway out on Long Island, you're out in eastern Long Island, you pay 20 bucks.  And you know you're going to get there because there's no traffic.  Guaranteed no traffic.  Guaranteed no traffic.  Guaranteed no traffic.  Paid in a second.  Paid.  In a second.  Who wouldn't?  And then that would be all tied up. 
[00:58:00]  You'd get a refund because too many people pay it.  Then make it higher.  Keep making it higher?  Make it really ridiculous high so you'd only use it if you really have to be somewhere quick.  Because sometimes you have to be somewhere, there's nothing you can do.  So it's like a hundred bucks.  Oof.  A hundred bucks.  Still worth it if you just...  Still well worth it if you need to get to the airport or something.  If you're still doing that, you know, that trip for just holidays, still worth it.  It's worth the trip.  Three hundred bucks a year to, you know, stay out of traffic?  Holiday traffic?  Big Kev's got something there.  He just said, old people got lots of money. 
[00:58:30]  Sons of bitches.  Age restriction.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I was wondering if anybody quotes SNL this weekend.  I missed it this weekend.  Opening skit at SNL.  Will Ferrell and, I don't know the other woman's name, they're doing that skit where they play  the musicians, and they're talking about brokers.  And Will Ferrell's talking about, you know, accountants and stuff and how they'll ruin you.  And that's exactly how he said it.  They'll ruin you?  Yeah.  They've got to get audio of that, man.  That's a stretch. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, no, but he definitely said he did the little accent and crap.  That's a funny goddamn bit when they do that.  Yeah, yeah.  You got somebody who has to have audio of that.  I think a couple weeks ago there was something that a lot of people missed out on.  They were doing some Olsen twin stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, during weekend update, right?  Yeah, Kid Rock said, hey, the Olsen twin.  There's grass.  Let's hit play on the field.  Yeah.  I just want to give a shout out to my brother Dave.  I was watching the other room.  Listen to the other room.  All right.  Later, guys.  Of course, because the shout out is so much more important than the line Anthony just said.  That's okay.  What was the line, Anthony? 
[00:59:30]  I was just saying what Kid Rock said.  He goes, is everybody in the country waiting for these two to turn 18?  Oh, yeah.  We started that a year and a half ago.  I thought it was just this show.  Damon, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to say that our herd definitely is thinning.  It's called AIDS and cancer.  Yeah, acts of God don't count, though.  Yeah.  Know what I mean?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We don't thin our own herd.  Not here in this country.  I know in other countries they do. 
[01:00:00]  You go into Rwanda and watch them hack apart a whole family with a machete, they're thinning  the herd, believe me.  Pretty violent.  They don't care.  That's what the lions are doing to the gazelle, though.  They go into a schoolhouse and just start hacking apart the opposition with machetes.  Ouch.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, not much.  They have the private highway system out there in California.  In California?  Because I was reading an article on this.  Yeah, it's in Riverside County and Orange County.  It's up and running, this highway, where you pay a ridiculous fee to use. 
[01:00:30]  Actually, it's only like four bucks every 12, 15 miles.  That's nothing.  Yeah, it's nothing.  It adds up after a while.  You guys know the highway system out there, how crowded it is, the traffic.  I don't know if that's the one.  I was reading there's one where the price is going to be really high to keep the people  off and it's going to be one of these almost super highways for rich people.  Well, that's the new one they're building.  And then the people that don't have as much money, this is going to take care of some of  the...  Oh, yes.  Because it'll take the rich people off the road.  Well, with the private highways now, it pays for maintenance on the public highways. 
[01:01:00]  It's making so much money.  Yeah.  All right, Jeff.  See you.  Bye.  I'm just saying, if you're in a hurry, like you have to get to the airport, there should  be a road you could take that you'll pay the extra cash, but you know it's clear.  I like it.  Throgs Neck Bridge went up to six bucks.  Did it?  That's just insane.  It's well worth it.  That's an attractive bridge to drive over.  It's insane.  I just drive out and wonder every time.  I turn around sometimes and hate again. 
[01:01:30]  Is it going to get to a point like people on Long Island are just not going to be able  to leave Long Island because they can't afford to?  They had a dream.  You know, until I left Long Island, I didn't realize what a drag it is to drive out to.  You know?  It's gotten ridiculous.  Get on these roads and I'm just like...  And that whole thing...  Remember years ago with Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant out there?  And they were always trying to say, no, we have an escape plan for Long Island.  No, we don't.  What?  You can't...  You can't get off of the island in less than three and a half, four hours. 
[01:02:00]  Never...  Imagine a nuclear disaster.  They really said they had an escape plan for Long Island.  They had escape roads like Sunrise Highway, all the way up to the North Shore, the LIE,  all the parkways would all of a sudden become escape roads, emergency routes.  Maybe if you have a James Bond car.  Yeah.  Because you're still going to be sitting in traffic burning.  That's their escape plan.  Bugs Bunny saws it off like Florida.  Right. 
[01:02:30]  And let it float away.  Let it float away.  As per Earl.  I don't...  There's no way to get off of that thing.  It's a pain in the ass.  I don't know...  But you take the train every day.  Yeah.  If it wasn't for the train, I would have to leave Long Island.  Yeah, but you leave here like you've got a wife in labor every night after the show.  I've got to catch the 722.  I've got a 722 to get on.  Isn't that inconvenient?  You've got to just bolt out.  Sometimes, but then I catch the one after that.  Yeah.  It's my excuse to get away from y'all. 
[01:03:00]  I like having the vehicle.  But I just couldn't take driving out to Long Island.  No, see, the vehicle...  I tried the vehicle after you and I stopped commuting.  Yeah.  It's...  They have made it impossible.  Yeah.  I mean, people...  I see them.  They're just pulling the hair out of their head.  I mean, there are nights when I'm hanging at Caroline's till whatever, 12, 1 o'clock at  night, and then, you know, now I got the car, because maybe it's a Saturday or something.  Easy drive home.  You would assume it would be a piece of cake to get home to the Huntington area.  There is traffic no matter what time you leave Manhattan over that 59th Street bridge 
[01:03:30]  or the tunnel.  And then they're building on the expressway there through Queens, so it's just a cluster  F.  It's amazing.  You're like, oh...  It can't be done.  Oh, it's 1.15 in the morning.  There can't be any traffic.  We'll be home in 35 minutes.  Yeah.  Wrong.  Like, where are these people coming from?  Where are all these people coming from?  212-757-1027.  Bill, you're next on WNEW.  Oh, hey.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, guys, not only do I have to suffer and sit there and eat with the Shwet in-laws 
[01:04:00]  yesterday, but it takes me four hours to get home from New High Park to Master Pequa.  Here's what they should do.  Here's the solution.  All right.  Have the driving test on holidays for these people.  And for the older people, have it at night.  So they can't see.  I can't see.  They can't.  They're killing us.  Make it harder.  You make it so they have to do some kind of maneuver besides just drive around and  park.  One maneuver, one driving emergency type maneuver, at least 20% of all drivers fail right there. 
[01:04:30]  They couldn't do it.  I agree.  It thins it out.  Take public transportation so you can pass.  And I'm not partial either.  Listen, my father's 80 years old.  God bless him.  He drives all over the place.  But even he should have a road test again.  All right.  They should have to take another one at 65 years old.  There you go.  Thanks, Bill.  Later, Bill.  I'll say it right now.  Old people off the goddamn road.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[01:05:00]  Listen, I had one point I got, too.  I just wanted to tell you to knock it off with complaining about the traffic while I'm  sitting in it.  You guys are my out.  All right.  I don't care.  I was in the last one.  I'm not supposed to be my out in this traffic.  I'm not supposed to be thinking about this.  You're right.  You're upsetting me.  And I got another solution with this traffic.  Yeah.  Okay?  You do the registration for the cars.  You do, like, one registration for a house, two registrations for a house, because you  got these spicks with 5,000 people living in the house.  Everybody's got a car. 
[01:05:30]  Ah.  And the same thing with the monkeys.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  What he's talking about.  I heard the most offensive racist joke yesterday at Easter dinner.  Oh, no.  At Easter dinner.  Easter dinner.  I was hanging out with Rick's family.  Mm-hmm.  The Puerto Ricans.  What's Puerto Rican Easter like, Opie?  It's good.  Yeah?  A lot of Puerto Rican-type food.  They served the turkey on a hubcap.  I was thinking maybe they would do that. 
[01:06:00]  No.  The food was delish.  Yeah?  Nice?  Good?  Yes.  It was very good.  But Rick's cousin, I don't even know if I can tell this on the air.  It is brutal.  Really bad?  Comes from a Puerto Rican.  Will that help?  Matters?  And what group does it attack?  Dude, your cousin, I wanted to say his name on the air, told the most racist joke at  Easter dinner last night.  I guess I got to throw it out there.  Throw it out there.  As soon as he said it, I'm like, oh, I'm using that on the radio.  Who was it against? 
[01:06:30]  Blacks.  Very popular race for jokes, of course.  Them and the Polish.  It's really quick.  What do you call?  I don't know.  Waddle-doodle.  Think before you speak.  Bone-dry snarlingsy.  I got one, too.  What do you call?  Ah.  Waddle-doodle.  Slingin' lead.  Opie, you want to be my partner?  I'm broadcasting on CB Band 19 in the Caribbean there. 
[01:07:00]  Does it matter if I say it's really offensive and it's brutal?  Okay.  Use Martians.  Hey, you want to tell Martian jokes today?  Martian jokes.  Martian jokes on the O&A show?  Opie, start off with a Martian joke.  A Martian joke.  Sorry to offend the Martians.  What do you call a Martian girl having an abortion? 
[01:07:30]  What would you call a Martian girl having an abortion?  What?  A crime stop.  Because the Martians are criminals.  I get it.  Oh, God.  Okay.  I got you.  It was a Martian joke.  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  How do you babysit a Martian?  How?  You wet its lips and stick them to the wall.  Oh.  What?  Hey, Ben's here.  Hey, Ben. 
[01:08:00]  How you doing, man?  What's up, Ben?  What's up, Ben?  See, you were to defend me with that whole Jesse thing earlier.  People don't understand how annoying that kid.  Did you hear that, Ben?  Well, you want to know what happened?  I actually, I was totally screwed, and then I got, thanks to some kind people that were fans of the show,  I got out of being in a real bad trial.  So I got into the big pool again.  So I put on the Walkman, and the first thing I hear is the whole thing with Jesse.  So I called, and he answered, like, a little while ago, to tell him I'm coming in.  And I'm like, hey, douchebag.  And he's like, who is this? 
[01:08:30]  I'm like, Jesse, you're a loser.  I'm just like, I'm going to kick your ass.  And I guess he thought it was Mark, and I wasn't even, you know, impersonating Mark.  Love the abuse on the retard.  I saw him outside.  See?  Oh, God damn.  See, because everyone started writing in, I'm a dick and stuff.  But you guys got to understand, Jesse gets under my nerves and Ben's nerves especially.  He's going to tell us what cool is all of a sudden.  Holy ass.  Wow.  I don't know.  The guy doesn't annoy me. 
[01:09:00]  I think it's kind of entertaining to hear about the hip scene going on.  If you weren't staring at the computer screen for two straight hours, he would ignore you too.  You don't get your lunch, then you get pissed.  I get pissed at anybody.  How about that 45 minutes it takes to get your lunch for a moment?  Oh, guys, I got the lunch.  I'm sure it eventually gets there.  I'm kind of easy going.  I'm going to mess the other day.  He's easy going.  He started with Earl about Earl being late or something. 
[01:09:30]  I'm like, dude, who is the one that takes forever just to get a sandwich?  He's like, oh, yeah, you're right.  30 minutes to get three cars.  Although he had a problem with Cowbell Bill.  He had a problem with Cowbell Bill the other day.  Remember Friday we were having the party over here?  And, yeah, Wild Bill Hillcock.  And Jesse came in and he had the gel in his hair.  So Bill said on the air, he goes, hey, what do you got there?  Some dippity-doo in your hair?  And we kind of like goofed with him and stuff.  And then after the show, he went up to Cowbell Bill and said, hey, you don't know me that well. 
[01:10:00]  What?  He walked away.  Yeah, that's what Bill told me.  So Bill was just like, hey, man, come on.  Does he want to defend this?  I don't know.  I don't know if he was goofing or what, you know, until I hear his side.  Because, Ben, I took a lot of abuse earlier.  People don't understand this.  I like you, Jesse.  I do.  I think you're funky.  Did you get into it with Cowbell Bill?  Wait, why?  Oh, were you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because Bill came up to me and said, he goes, what's up with Jesse?  I said, what happened? 
[01:10:30]  And he described that situation and said that you said, hey, you don't know me that well.  And, like, he was like, oh, dude, was he pissed?  I was being completely sarcastic.  I thought he laughed when I said it, so I thought he got it.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe he was just laughing at you, like, you know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, wow, we got, okay.  All right, Jess.  We got to move on, because we got Abigail.  She's celebrating her 17th birthday today.  We're going to get her in next.  Tell her that, all right?  She's been waiting patiently outside the studio.  And, Bella.  Hi.  Bella, we got to take a break, but we want to talk to you next, okay? 
[01:11:00]  Okay.  Bella.  Are you on a car phone?  Oh, yeah, I am.  All right, hold on.  We'll get your number.  We'll call you back, or you can call us back, all right?  Okay.  And we're telling Martian jokes today, by the way.  Don't hang up.  We will bring you morphine.  Oh, I have a lot of good Martian jokes.  Bella, I think we can take care of you.  You think so?  Yes.  Hold on.  I need to take care of you.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We'll get into it next, okay?  Yes.  That's going to be a good call, and we'll do that next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027 WNEW.  Uncle John, real fast.  We're in the middle of a commercial here.  Okay, guys.  Hey, how many Martians does it take to tar a roof?  How many Martians does it take to tar a roof?  I've never heard this Martian joke before.  How many, Uncle John?  Two if you slice them, kid.  Thank you, Uncle John.  You're welcome.  Bye.  All right, bye.  I've been Martians. 
[01:12:00]  Anthony, Planet Java.  Hey, finally, iced coffee just got cool.  It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java, it ain't no social drink.  It's an iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  We drink this stuff all the time.  Matter of fact, I would love, I think it's a Javadelic.  Javadelic.  Javadelic.  I like the Javadelic.  That would be a grown-up milkshake, Opie.  The perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling truck.  They've hit the streets and are coming to an area near you with cool new flavors like 
[01:12:30]  Javadelic, Tremble, and Caramoca.  Caramoca is a chocolate caramel in a coffee drink.  Yeah.  It's like a dessert.  It's a morning drink and a great mixer, too.  And Tremble.  Need we say more about Tremble?  You need a kick?  How's 121 milligrams of caffeine?  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  Tremble.  Gives you a major boost.  You're going to love it.  Tremble does the trick deliciously.  Be yourself with Planet Java iced coffee with an attitude.  And available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.

Who else gets you a bus filled with naked jeans that you can see from the streets of Manhattan?  What are you doing for new jeans? 
[01:13:30]  Come on.  You can't arrest a boy or a bus.  Now you're doing it.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027.  Monster Magnet playing with Buck Chery tonight on the island, Anthony.  Yes.  At the Vanderbilt. 
[01:14:00]  I think there's some tickets available.  A bunch of us are going to the show.  We got Dave from Monster Magnet on the line right now, Anthony.  Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, huh?  What's up, fellas?  What's happening?  How are you, bro?  I'm sitting in Long Island.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, well, actually, I'm right across from Vanderbilt right now.  They put me in the fabulous roadway in.  You're at the roadway?  Yeah, I think I saw this in Goodfellas one time.  I don't think I'm in a very good room.  Oh, God, that sucks.  No, it's okay.  I like being close to the gate.  You like the seedy hotels, right? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, well, you know.  They got a lot more personality.  Plus, you know, they don't come after you to pay for stuff when stuff gets messed up, you know?  You took the big quilt thing off of the bed right away?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm hip to that.  Yeah, because they don't wash it.  I'm hip to the fecal matter.  You got to bring your own sheets to places like that.  Because it's always the drunks that come in and will just start effing right on top of that big thing,  and they don't wash it.  You have never seen the housekeeping shit.  I'm sure it was in the New York Times or something, 
[01:15:00]  and then they took a sample of it, and it was just, it was curdling.  Teaming.  You know, forget it.  Teaming with life.  Oh.  Yeah.  So are you psyched to play Long Island tonight, Dave?  Yeah.  You hardly ever play Long Island.  And this place looks like, I don't know, it looks like some Art Deco.  It's a cool room, though.  Yeah, it looks cool.  It's different.  Yeah.  I mean, you're a Jersey guy.  Mm-hmm.  I was almost choking on myself.  Sorry, Dave.  They're writing us notes. 
[01:15:30]  I got to explain something to you.  Uh-huh.  We have a girl outside the studio.  Her name's Abigail.  Yeah.  Maybe you can help us out with this.  She just turned 17 today, and we're trying to figure out the legal age in New York State.  Yeah.  I think for sex, it's 17, but to take pictures, it's 18.  I'm pretty sure that's right.  I would imagine it would be 18.  Especially under the current leadership of New York City, I would imagine that you guys 
[01:16:00]  will be pushing it if you take a picture.  Yeah.  I don't think we could take any pictures.  We heard you can't take pictures until 18, but you can pretty much do whatever you want  with a 17-year-old.  Right.  Really?  Is that true?  Well, that's why we're asking you.  You're the rock star.  Yeah.  I think you've had some...  Hey, man, I try to stay away from the rules as much as possible.  I don't ask any questions.  Well, what would you do?  What would Dave do from Monster Vagin?  Yeah.  All right.  You're done with the show, right?  Yeah.  You're at the Vanderbilt.  Chick comes up.  She says, I'm 17.  She's hot.  What do you do? 
[01:16:30]  And she has proof she's 17.  Yeah.  What do you do, man?  Well, I mean, for a matter of course for me, in the United States, it's too young.  You know why?  Because it's just too young in the States.  But in Europe, on the other hand, it's a completely different story.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They grow up different over there.  Really?  Oh.  You guys don't.  It's like the 18th century over there.  Oh, my God.  There's a place called Estonia.  It's right near Finland.  Uh-huh.  And their whole trip there is to raise their kids, girls in particular, to marry, to go 
[01:17:00]  out there and start getting into it when they're 14.  Nice.  There's no sex age.  So I'll get into it when they're 14 and marry by the time they're 17 or 18, preferably  to a man that's over 30.  Come on.  I am not kidding.  This is totally sanctioned by the government, religion, and everything.  In fact...  And what is the reason for this?  I think they want to boost the economy.  And they want to get people to move there.  And they want guys to...  They just want everyone to feel good. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  You know, it's a weird old Euro thing.  They've been doing this for a long time.  Over there, they don't ask questions like this.  But I tell you, I've never seen anything like this in my life.  So you hook up?  It was insane.  Well, it was so bad that I was with this girl that looked like...  You know, looked like she was 14.  She was 17.  And she goes, you know, it's absolutely okay, you know.  It's okay.  Did you do it?  You're American.  I didn't do it.  Yeah, sure.  That must have been after you quit the drugs. 
[01:18:00]  Well, you know something...  You look at it, there's some people that are made that are ready.  And there are other people that aren't ready.  No matter who says they're ready.  This one wasn't ready.  But I tell you what, there was like a thousand others that weren't ready.  And every band crew member I know that I've toured around with in the United States and the world,  they're all moving there.  Really?  I know guys who just bought houses in Estonia.  It's like incredible.  It's like this exodus to this country. 
[01:18:30]  You've got to see it to believe it.  And did you ever hear about the Swedish love boat?  The Swedish love boat?  No.  Oh, the Swedish love boat.  It goes from Helsinki, Finland to Stockholm, Sweden.  Oh.  Filled up with teenagers that just go in there and drink.  Okay.  And then just have sex all over the boat.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nice.  There you go.  I mean, this boat is like the big red boat or whatever that thing is.  Really?  Like a cruise ship.  It's a whole bunch of people.  Yeah.  They have gambling on it and discos and stuff. 
[01:19:00]  And it's just pretty much like a rolling...  The F boat.  Yeah.  The F boat.  It's a sex boat.  It's an orgy boat.  Are 30-year-old guys allowed to go?  Are you kidding?  They're like the prize.  Yeah, right?  That's what I mean.  Like over there, it's just a whole different trip.  They want their kids to marry guys that have some money and stuff.  They're really good.  All right.  Book it.  Hey, Dave, is it true that you once said that you did enough coke to kill an elephant?  I did.  You're not doing the blow anymore?  No.  You know, I did it so much I think I fried my syntax down to it like a hairy nub. 
[01:19:30]  I have just one nostril in the middle of my head and I have to flush it like once a week.  Jesus.  Well, what happened where you finally said, you know what, this is it.  Everyone's got the one night.  The one night.  Yeah, I do have the one night.  It was called death night.  Yeah.  I got sick.  I was sick in Europe for a couple months and I got sicker and sicker.  And one day in Canada, I woke up and I couldn't move. 
[01:20:00]  I was like, I don't think this is good.  I need some coke to get my energy.  Yeah, I was like, I don't think the coke is going to help me out of this one.  And they sent me to a hospital and the guys just totally freaked out.  They said, there's not one vitamin left in your body.  They put me on a medevac plane.  It was like a huge trip.  You know, they choppered me out of there.  Wow.  I put me on a plane.  Not one vitamin left in your body.  There's nothing.  You know, there's no sustenance for it.  It's just like veins of drugs.  And I went to, came back to Jersey for a couple weeks and I went to see a doctor. 
[01:20:30]  And he goes, you know something, kid, you got the body of a 69 Camaro.  But if you feed a 69 Camaro urine every day for the rest of your life, it's going to break down.  And I said, okay, I know what you're talking about.  So that was it.  I get the car analogy, Doc.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, see.  Yeah, I got the car analogy.  And ever since then, you know, to say the truth, it's like I've done enough.  I've done enough.  Are you still drinking, though? 
[01:21:00]  No.  So what do you do when you're on tour to pass the time in the...  What do you think I do when I'm on tour?  In the seedy hotel.  What do you think I do?  Well, you do a little of that effing.  Watch TV and F.  Yeah.  And yell at Fred Durst.  And yell at Fred.  Oh, yeah.  I don't even see that guy.  But, yeah.  You know, he's jealous right there.  You're really not into the rap rock, are you?  Well, you know, it's not that I'm not into rap or not into rock.  It's just like the rap rock.  It gets pretty embarrassing after a while.  I mean...  You've got to admit it when it first hit, it was kind of cool, but now there's too much 
[01:21:30]  of it, right?  Yeah.  Well, you know, when the Beastie Boys were doing it, it was classy.  And that was a long time ago.  And then basically what happens is, I mean, to me, is that these guys are like boy bands.  You know, they're like the Backstreet Boys.  I mean, get over it, man.  Look, they all look the same.  They all sing the same song.  It's corporate.  They got stuff.  You know, they got endorsements up the butt, like all over the place.  It's pussy music.  It's like, these guys think they're being all like revolutionary and hard and stuff? 
[01:22:00]  Believe me, man.  They look like the monkeys.  You know, hey, look, man.  I got a tattoo and a lip piercing.  Give me a break.  And plus, does anyone like, does anyone realize that this is music made by men for men?  I mean, how screwed up is that?  No, you need the chicks at your show.  Yeah, you need chicks at your show.  And you've got to sing to women, too.  I mean, well, this is crap.  Believe me, man.  In this day and age, it's the year 2001. 
[01:22:30]  The economy's good.  If you're a white kid in America, it ain't that tough.  You know what I mean?  What are they complaining about?  So, where do you think the music's headed?  Pardon?  Where do you think music is headed?  Are we going to get rid of it?  It's going to be all this.  I mean, the guys that do it good are going to keep on doing it good.  Like, the Deftones and Korn, those guys do it.  You know, they do it well.  You're right.  All this, like, monkey's crap and bubblegum rap rock and angst rock and stuff.  That'll go away.  And personally, you know, I'll put a serious note on the thing, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:23:00]  I think there's going to be not a return of anything.  I think it's going to be a hybrid of music that actually speaks to people.  People are going to care about melody more.  People are going to care about words, and they're not going to care as much as being punched in the face.  Because that's what these bands are about, punching the face, which is cool.  I mean, I can appreciate the testosterone.  We're going to get back to good songs again.  Good songs.  Yeah, it's going to be more songs and stuff.  And basically, you're going to have to start, you know, these guys are going to have to start singing. 
[01:23:30]  They're going to have to get out.  Yeah.  You can't just holler.  I mean, rap is one thing, man.  When rap came out, rap was from the inner city.  It was made by people who didn't have the money to actually buy instruments.  And they created this thing that was, like, very organic.  It was made from reality.  What we get now is kind of like a half-assed copy of the whole thing.  And it's not, it's like kids copying somebody else's culture, but not anything new to it, you know? 
[01:24:00]  Well, that's something that's been happening for quite a while.  So there's no suburban culture anymore.  And, like, when I was a kid, there was a lot of suburban culture.  There was punk rock.  There was rock.  It was, and even, and all the black guys I went to school, they were always like,  what are you doing with the rock?  They loved hard rock.  You know, they loved it because they thought it was something different from what they did.  So does our own black girl.  Yeah.  You know?  You know?  I talked to rap guys, and they're like, and I go, what do you think about this? 
[01:24:30]  What do you think about that?  And they go, man, I don't know what these guys are doing, but they're just throwing their whole identity away.  They be clowning.  They be clowning.  They be clowning.  If I may use the lingo.  Hey, what do you think is going to happen to Britney Spears eventually?  Oh, she'll get married, you know?  She'll get married to a big, big star.  I mean, she's like Pepsi Cola, you know?  Coca-Cola kind of thing.  She's beyond.  You know what, though?  I hate to admit it, Dave.  She can sing whatever she wants.  Oh, she's awesome.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to get her in one of your videos.  You always have the hot chicks in your videos.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:00]  She's soft, though.  Her stomach.  I mean, she's really hot, but I think Christina Aguilera sings better.  And I'd take her for a spin before Britney Spears.  Thank you.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of like the Britney thing because it's so Euro.  Like, the guys that make those records are like Swedish guys and stuff, and you can tell  it sounds like that Euro disco thing, you know?  Oompa, oompa, oompa.  I don't think I've ever heard either one of them sing, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I just stare and go.  Watch with the sound off.  Hey, Dave, where do you get the hot girls for your videos? 
[01:25:30]  Anywhere I can, man.  Like, one time I remember just driving up and down to L.A.  All the strip clubs.  They're like $6,000 in my pocket going, you want to be in a video?  It was great.  And your style is being copied by all the black artists I've noticed over the years?  Where do you get a copy?  Well, I just copied.  You know, I copied from...  Or did you copy from them?  Yeah, I copied from them.  Either way, you're getting the hot chicks in the videos again.  Yeah, I just thought it was...  I mean, some of those grunge videos were cool to a point, but it's like, all right, let's 
[01:26:00]  get back to checking out some girls and their bodies.  Yeah, I mean, you've got to get down to the original reason people get in a rock and roll  band in the first place.  You know, it's not to discover a pure for cancer.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Yeah, I mean, pretty much that's the way it starts, and that's the way it ever is.  And if anybody tells you any different, they're lying to you.  Yeah, any thoughts on Joey Ramone passing?  Big time.  Joey Ramone was an American original, man.  There's nobody like him before, and there'll be nobody like him later. 
[01:26:30]  The whole Ramones thing is just such a trip.  Really, really American, and particularly New York.  You know, I mean, that couldn't happen anywhere else but New York.  Ramones couldn't happen anywhere else but New York.  Yeah, it's a big deal.  Joey Ramone dying is a big deal, because the Ramones proved that even if you didn't have  a lot of musical talent, you can get by by your wits.  Right.  You can use your imagination to be in a rock and roll band, which a lot of people didn't  realize, so those guys showed up.  All right.  There you have it.  Well, we're going to see you a little later. 
[01:27:00]  Right on.  It's Monster Magnet.  Dave from Monster Magnet playing with Buck Cherry tonight at the Vanderbilt on Long Island.  Dave hanging out in the seedy hotel across the street.  Uh-huh.  Hey, we're going to play one from God Says No, all right?  Right on, man.  Thank you, Dave.  Come back and see us, all right?  We will.  Right on.  All right.  There he goes, Dave.  Lead singer of Monster Magnet.  We could jam a tune today, can't we, Ed?  Sure.  Why don't we play Heads Explode?  All right.  My sad is I look at topless pictures of anacornical.  And we'll tell you how you can find them next.

Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Irving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Yeah, it's the ONA show. 
[01:29:00]  Lots going on today.  We got Abigail in the studio.  It's her 17th birthday.  Or it was his past weekend, right?  Saturday.  Saturday.  My 17th birthday.  Abigail, a huge fan of the show.  Happy birthday.  And all the fans, fans of Abigail, matter of fact.  Yes.  Your pictures made the rounds a while back.  Yeah, I heard outside.  We kind of had to get rid of those pictures for some odd.  They had to disappear.  Well, it wasn't like you were naked.  No.  You weren't naked in any of these pictures. 
[01:29:30]  Not naked.  Fully legal.  And you were 16 at the time of those pictures.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, Abigail's the girl that's on FoundryMusic.com.  Well, the Abigail countdown clock is on FoundryMusic.com.  Yes.  Counting down the days until she's 18.  And then we were bringing in the lesbian couch, right?  Uh-huh.  Definitely.  Only another year away.  Yeah.  Not even, Anthony.  Her birthday was Saturday.  Right, so it's under a year.  363 days to go.  We should check with Steve to make sure the countdown clock,  clock is accurate. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, make sure there's nothing like a leap year that might F it up  or screw it up by a day.  Oh, is that one of those leap years?  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  Oh, well.  That would help the situation, right?  No, we made it longer.  Leap year?  We made it a day longer.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  And she's, um, she's, what, a junior in high school?  Yes, you're a junior in high school.  Jesus Christ.  I just did some quick math in my head.  It's pathetic. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You weren't even born when I started radio.  84 I was born.  84.  You'll be taking your SATs next year.  Well, good luck to you.  Good luck to the SATs.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Holy S.  Steve, grab a mic.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, feverishly.  Yeah, we got a link to pass on to everyone today.  Yes, you can find it on Foundry.  As a matter of fact, within the next couple of minutes, it will pop up on the home page, 
[01:31:00]  the link directly to the site where you could see some lovely shots of Miss Anna Kornikova.  Non-doctored shots, I might add.  Yeah, there's been a lot of pictures of Anna Kornikova circulating where they say Anna Topless.  And you're like, no, you can tell it's the fake Photoshop kind of head melting.  Yeah, there's poor edits that are just circulating and have been for years.  And there have been some good-looking ones where it's like, oh, look, she's wearing this real sheer shirt for no apparent reason,  and it's wet, and you can see her move.  Those are all fake.  This seems to have been taken during a vacation. 
[01:31:30]  And there are some pictures of her reclining on a little chaise lounge, getting some sun.  And she's got her top off.  And she's wearing a thong.  And she's very tan all over.  And they are authentic pictures of Anna Kornikova with her top off.  Really classy tabloid kind of shots.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're great pics.  They'll be in a tabloid.  Probably one of those in London tabloids.  Mm-hmm.  Where they get away with more, it seems. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Dare to dream.  Wow, your website's getting pounded already.  Come on.  And then, look, there's one of her on all fours kind of getting into position to lay on her belly.  Here's one of her taking her top off.  And she's turning over in this one.  Look at this.  Wow.  How about that?  Steve's got it up.  It's up.  Yes.  Look at this.  It's there.  Look at that.  There you go.  Foundrymusic.com.  You can see Anna Kornikova, real pictures of her topless. 
[01:32:30]  Look at this.  Look at this.  See?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Looks like she's turning over.  Her back got too much sun.  He certainly did.  Look at the ass muscles on this chick.  Jesus.  Push you right out.  Best legs in the business right there.  Nice.  Nice.  The nicest legs ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  I'm not going to ask Abigail when was the last time she had detention, Rick.  When was the last time you had detention? 
[01:33:00]  Any detention?  Not since sophomore year.  You were bad then?  What did you do?  I think I cut a class.  I think that was the worst thing I've done.  It was sex in the closet, wasn't it?  In the broom closet there at the school.  She went to her strip club for her 17th birthday.  You did, did you?  Oh, thank you for telling my father.  Sorry, Dad.  Don't listen, Dad.  We went to Delilah's Den for my birthday with my sister and a bunch of my friends.  Did you get a lap dance?  Two.  Two?  Two.  A girl named Alexis.  She's beautiful.  She's very, very nice. 
[01:33:30]  What song did she do?  Did you get a stripper smell on you, though?  No.  Stripper sweat and perfume and body glitter?  No.  No?  No.  She actually, she smelled really good.  She was real soft.  She was real nice.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You liking the girls better than the guys?  Apples and oranges.  Two totally different things.  But she likes them both.  Too early to tell, I think.  Yeah.  Let me go to Stockbroker Dave.  Dave!  Hey, boys!  What's going on, buddy?  How's everything?  Does Abigail want to play Win Stockbroker Dave's Money?  Uh, Dave?  Go ahead. 
[01:34:00]  Save that for bail.  If we're going to be playing that game.  Come on.  I know she can't take, she can't have sex and, uh, you can't take pictures, but maybe  she can win Stockbroker Dave's Money.  No, we found out today that 17, yes, you could have the sex.  You could have sex.  You just can't take, uh, uh, pictures of her.  It's 16 in New Jersey, actually.  You don't have to wait to be 17.  Well, we're in New York.  We're in New York.  Oh, it's 16 in Jersey?  16 in Jersey, but...  Everyone head for Jersey.  Have some, uh, 16-year-old sex.  So, I mean, technically, we could have brought him the lesbian couch today for her. 
[01:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  Right?  In, uh...  Why the hell are we waiting until 18?  We just can't take pictures.  Oh, that's the reason.  Yeah.  How old do you have to be to be with a wiffle ball bat?  Would you...  Dave, the wiffle ball bat isn't to be brought up here.  I have a feeling Stockbroker Dave did well today on the floor.  That's for our sleazier hose bags.  Very slow, Hope.  It was very slow today on Wall Street.  Yeah.  All right.  Very quiet. 
[01:35:00]  Well, we've got to play another round of Win Stockbroker Dave's Money.  I'm ready.  Another show has taken that concept and ran with it.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  I...  You know, that's all I can say.  What happened?  I didn't hear this.  There's other chances to win fill-in-the-blanks money going on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  All right, Dave.  Well, uh, come by and see you soon, all right?  All right, boys.  Be well.  All right.  We also have, uh, Bella on the line.  Bella.  Bella.  Bella. 
[01:35:30]  Hi, guys.  Hi, Bella.  You like the name Bella, do you?  Yeah.  Bella, yeah, that's so sexy.  Bella Lagosi.  Ooh.  Bella, is that your real name?  Yes, it is.  How stupid are you?  Yeah, what do you...  Well, don't reen it up.  Who cares?  Why would you use your real name?  Why do I care?  All right.  Well, explain your situation.  What's the problem?  Okay.  I've been married for 10 years and, um, haven't had sex with my husband in over three years. 
[01:36:00]  Whoa.  He has absolutely no interest whatsoever.  He has no interest.  All right.  Now, let's dig a little deeper into this situation.  Yeah, let's go with this for a while.  Let's get all the basic questions out of the way.  Don't be insulted or do anything.  I just want to get all this answered quickly.  How many...  I'll start.  How many pounds have you gained since, uh, your wedding day?  And be honest.  Uh-oh.  Hello?  None.  Oh, I thought she ate the phone.  Why were you laughing?  I haven't gained any, actually. 
[01:36:30]  How much did you weigh when you got married?  118.  And you still weigh 118?  Yes, I do.  And how tall are you?  5'7".  All right.  5'7", 118.  That's nice.  How...  Have you had children?  One.  You've had a child.  How long ago?  Mm-hmm.  How long ago?  Uh, three years.  Ah.  Uh-oh.  Here it is.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh, red flag.  Something seems to be matching up here.  Three years.  You haven't had sex with a husband. 
[01:37:00]  Uh, three years ago, you had a kid.  That's right.  Now, did he all of a sudden not want to have sex with you because you were a mommy?  I think that might be it.  I really do.  Yes.  Yes.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I think that he, um, he can't look at me that way anymore.  I don't understand why.  Was he in the delivery room during the birth?  Yes, he was.  See?  Guys, stay the hell out of there.  It's a place for doctors.  You don't want to see that.  There's a beautiful thing.  The woman's area. 
[01:37:30]  And then you're looking at a scene from Alien.  Remember that?  I want to check that out someday.  No.  No.  No.  Check it out.  Maybe if it's something, maybe to walk in, uh, someone you don't know and see that.  But if it's the, as Dice says, pleasure pouch that you're used to, you don't want to see  the next heir to your throne coming out of it.  No one wants, you know, and the women are so, you want to rap them sometimes.  You've got to be in there.  You've got to be in there for the birth thing.  You don't understand what this is going to do to me. 
[01:38:00]  But Anthony, a lot of people are taping that these days.  Tape?  Oh, that's another one.  What the hell are you going to show?  And most people don't, uh, find it offensive or disturbing.  Now on DVD from Time Warner.  What are you, who are you showing that to?  Why are you watching it again?  You know our buddy Brother Weiss?  Yes.  Who does that show on Saturday nights?  Uh-huh.  He taped it with all the kids in the room and they, uh, they watch it from time to time.  Why the hell would you pop that in the VCR?  Check it out.  Why would you bring a camera?  Why would you watch it?  I'm for the old school Ricky Ricardo and Lucy. 
[01:38:30]  You stand out in the waiting room pacing back and forth with Fred.  And then when you hear it's a birth, you get the cigar and everything's fine.  I don't want any part of inside that goddamn room.  It's the women that came up with that.  And the pussy whip guy decides he's now going to join his women in there.  You can't go in, guys.  You cannot go in there and see that.  Because look, it turned Bella's husband off to her area.  That's exactly what happened, Bella.  Bella, did you talk to him about this? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  And what has he said?  Get out of the way.  I'm watching golf.  Well, it's golf.  But is it Tiger and the Masters?  Of course.  Yes, actually, yeah.  I mean, Tiger is Tiger, you know.  Let's Tiger put something in a hole.  Jesus.  Come on.  Somebody better soon.  Oh, but ladies, don't ask you guys to do this.  So, have you seen someone?  I'm thinking about it.  Ah, so now you're thinking of cheating. 
[01:39:30]  I think we were supposed to have you on about a week ago.  You even said that you walk around the house nude in front of him.  Yeah.  You're doing everything to try to get his attention and nothing is happening, right?  And he just watches TV or says, get away from me or what?  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Pretty much just sit there and choose me away.  Even when you're naked?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  It is very bad.  Ouch.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  That's tough to swallow. 
[01:40:00]  So, do you pleasure yourself there?  Oh, absolutely.  It's not because the barn doors are dragging on the floor like a tail, is it?  Absolutely not.  All right.  It's still nice and tight there?  Well, it's been three years.  I would assume it is very.  It's got to look like a little cherry stone clam.  Yeah, you don't have the cowboy doors, do you?  Right.  No.  You don't want it looking like an old Long Island mussel.  No.  You know?  It's got to look like a nice cherry stone clam that you look at when you pick it up and go,  this is going to be a hard one to shuck. 
[01:40:30]  I'm going to have a hard time shucking the hell out of this one.  Because it's tight.  And shuck and shuck.  I'm going to shuck and shuck until this is open.  Because you don't want one that looks like it's been out in the sun too long,  like a big Long Island mussel that's kind of open and some of the meat is hanging out of it.  Oh, I'm talking about Long Island mussel.  We've all seen them.  But you know the tight cherry clams, Anthony?  I find if you want to shuck those type of clams, you shuck it from behind.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of times you try to go in from the front first. 
[01:41:00]  It's hard.  So you've got to turn that cherry stone around and shuck it from behind.  Right at the back first.  And that loosens up the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  That baby will open right up.  And it's so sweet.  Yes, yes.  A little cocktail sauce in there.  And it's perfect.  Right down.  Okay.  Well, I feel bad for whoever I get my hands on.  Why?  Are you just going to ravage the guy?  Absolutely.  All right. 
[01:41:30]  Now, what have you done that makes you think you're going to cheat soon?  Have you been putting the feelers out?  I don't have to.  What do you mean?  The feelers come to me.  Oh, so you go to...  Have you gone out, though, to a bar, to someplace where you normally wouldn't go just to attract  you guys?  No, I don't have to.  Well, you stay in your house and guys knock on the door.  Well, no.  I go out to work and...  And guys come on to you?  Yes, absolutely. 
[01:42:00]  What do you do for work?  Yeah.  What type of work?  Um, I'll just say that I'm a doctor.  That's all.  Uh-oh.  Are you really a doctor?  Yes, sir.  Look at that.  Wow.  Why don't you just get a divorce?  I'm thinking about it.  Well, she wants to just cheat to begin with, right?  Obviously, I'm not getting anything from him, and I can take care of myself, so...  How many times do you pet the poodle a day?  At least twice.  Wow.  You're all horned up and nothing to... 
[01:42:30]  You still...  How old a gal are you?  35.  You're 35.  You're all horned up.  You're still looking good.  Your ass looks nice and everything?  Yes, it does.  Hasn't...  It's not dropped or nothing?  Do you want to...  No, no.  Do you want to come in?  I work out every day.  Do you want to come in so we can take a look at you?  Sure.  Make sure nothing's sagging?  Yeah, you just come in, and we'll scope it out a little bit, and then maybe we'll find  you some, I don't know, someone to cheat with, so we can be mentioned in the trial. 
[01:43:00]  You know what?  We can set up a cheating for you.  That's easy.  Can you?  Yeah, we try to do this one other time, and the person backed out.  We're willing...  This is what we're willing to do, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're willing to bring Bella down, but you have to cheat that day, okay?  Oh, absolutely.  She's ready to cheat on the phone.  You come down...  On the phone.  Oh, baby.  You come down, and we'll line up, I don't know, 10 or 12 guys, and you decide who you 
[01:43:30]  want to cheat with, and you'll be whisked away in a limousine around Manhattan as you  cheat.  Oh, okay.  Imagine we hook her up with some Martian with a big friggin' slump.  You're making money.  Bella, would you be into this one?  I think so, yes.  All right.  So you want us to line up some Martians?  No Martians, though.  No Martians?  Okay.  No.  All right.  No.  How about some Venetians? 
[01:44:00]  How about Anthony?  No, no, no.  Yeah, you just throw that pipe wrench into the works, too.  It'll be a...  Jared, are you?  Huh?  Yeah, petrified.  Jared, are you?  Totally petrified.  No.  I'm in a relationship.  Yeah, with a little girl.  Nice.  So, Bella, come on down.  When are we going to do this?  We'll even get a limousine from...  Top-notch limousine.  Whoa!  Shameless plug. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know the phone number.  I only know the phone number for the other place you work for.  We'll get a limo from Vital Transportation.  Yes.  The cheat limo.  1-800-TRY-A-LIMO?  No, I don't know the phone number.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  Oh, 1-800-GO-VITAL.  So, this is what we'll do, Bella.  You come down, and you'll have 10 or 12 guys to pick, and you'll pick the guy, and then  you go downstairs to the limousine, and you go around and... 
[01:45:00]  You have an affair.  You have an affair.  Cheat on your husband.  Are you into it, or what?  I think so, yes.  Think?  Yeah, you've got to be sure now.  You're making a commitment.  Too many people blow us off when we set up these fine things for them.  Okay, I say yes, but I have to...  Check with your husband?  Clear my schedule.  I check with your husband.  Oh, my God.  All right, Rick's going to talk to you further, but if you're game, we'll set up some guys.  I mean, they're already calling.  Hold on. 
[01:45:30]  Let me talk to Dom.  Dom, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Dom, what's up?  Hey, I'm willing and available.  Yo, I'm looking for a stack of tuna cans.  Personality, yes.  You have to have some personality.  That's me.  I'm full personality.  That's me.  I'm full personality.  Maybe I can do some personal.  I'm full personality.  I want a nice-looking, muscular guy with a Harley, so I can...  My father, right there. 
[01:46:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, bring in my daddy.  Oh, my God.  Abigail's father will do you, Bella.  My father, he's got a Harley.  Big, muscular guy with a Harley.  All right, so we've got to set up big, muscular guys with Harleys for Bella, Rick.  Hey, Bella.  My daddy hasn't gotten any in a while, I'm pretty sure.  Bella.  Yes?  Do you think your husband's cheating on you?  I don't think so.  But three years without sex for a guy, I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Something's got to be going on that way.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Cranking that thing like the pump in Helen Keller.  Bella, let me give you a tip, though.  Every day.  We all love sports, but after a while, you know, you've got to take care of the situation down there.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  I want in.  Dom, you want in?  All right, hold on to the line, okay?  All right, hold on. 
[01:47:00]  Hold on.  Here you go.  This is getting good.  Let's go to Justin.  Justin, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, let me toss this girl one.  I'll throw her one real good.  Yeah?  I may not be Mr. Universe, but I got a hog in my pants.  He's got a hog.  Yeah, the girls love to ride my hog.  Yeah, Bella, you can't ask for much, because this is an all-out banging.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you will.  You know something?  You've got to commit.  If you're going to go out on this date and you're going to be in the limo. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  That's stupid gay radio.  Right.  We do bangings.  If you're going to do this and get in the limo with a guy, you know, there's going to be banging going on.  Right.  I think I'm a short thing, guys.  Wow.  You're a short thing for banging.  We call it a banging.  Does she mind me using...  Hold on.  You can't put it in those terms.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  Bella.  Yeah.  What are you into?  Are you into oral?  Oh, yeah.  Both giving and receiving. 
[01:48:00]  Absolutely.  Hey, how about that?  Hey, Anthony.  What?  Does she mind if I donkey punch her when I'm from behind her?  Well, what about a donkey punch, Bella?  I don't know if you could donkey punch the girl.  Bella, we could set you up with two guys in the limo.  Oh.  Well, what about that?  One's on her back.  We'll need to get the pinochle deck.  Hold on.  Justin's out of control over there.  Bella, two guys?  How about two guys and a girl?  Two guys and a girl.  We could probably make that happen as well. 
[01:48:30]  I'm sure you could.  All right.  Let me see what Andy's got for Bella.  Andy.  Oh, and hey.  How you doing?  Well, someone needs to bang Bella.  Look, I'm married.  I haven't had it for a while.  Me and my wife just ain't happening.  Bella, I'm your man.  All right.  That's double.  Bella, that's even better.  No commitment.  He's in the same situation as you.  You can get the banging out of the way and you go back to your miserable lives.  Plus O&A.  Yeah.  I love O&A and I'm very good at it. 
[01:49:00]  Well, why are you telling me that?  Well, for she to tell Bella.  When you say Bella.  I'm not for a topper.  When you say Bella, I'm into blah, blah, blah, you know?  Okay.  All right.  Bella, what do you think of Andy?  Any questions?  No questions.  The rich has a good point.  He's working in Midtown.  He says she's full of ass.  If she was serious about this, she wouldn't be giving out her real name on the radio.  Yeah, why?  She doesn't care anymore.  She?  Oh, she meaning Bella. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Let's get another guy in here for you.  Let's go to Evan.  Evan.  Evan.  Evan.  Hey.  Evan.  He's right there, too.  Jake Goff.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  This is Ray Watson calling from Evan.  Good, Dixie and I will do it.  Ray Watson.  Call me from...  That's my favorite Martian.  All right.  We understand.  Yeah, I'm just trying to...  All right.  All right. 
[01:50:00]  I'm a dick.  All right.  Bye.  There you go.  All right, Bella.  Yes?  So we're just going to have to set this up.  When are you going to be free?  I'm free every day.  Every day?  It's in the Constitution, baby.  So when do you want to come down?  Later this week?  That sounds good to me.  Sound a little wacky.  Not a little wacky.  If you're pulling our leg, then you've got to tell us, because we'll set the whole thing  up.  We'll hook you up.  We'll get banged. 
[01:50:30]  We'll get the limo, and we'll get all these guys to come in, and then you decide which one  you want to go to the limo in.  Okay.  I'm not pulling any legs.  What I will do is I will clear my schedule Monday this week.  Okay.  And I will call you guys back and let you know what day is good.  Okay.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  And we'll have a studio filled with guys to make sure you get one that you really want.  Okay.  That sounds fair to me.  No strings attached.  It's all about just getting banged.  One banging.  That's it.  One banging for Bella.  That's it.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  Hold on.  Rick's going to talk to you.  Okay.  All right.  Let me just grab Jeremy real fast.  Jeremy!  Yo, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Oh, bro, you've got to let me get in there.  I'm 18 years old, 6'3", 255 times the muscle.  You've got to let me get this old lady in there, man.  Bella, what do you think?  I don't know.  Huh?  He's an instructor.  I'm serious, man.  You want an 18-year-old?  We could do that.  I've got a lot of experience.  What do you think?  He doesn't shut his effing mouth, though, so Bella could answer. 
[01:51:30]  Well, you blame him?  He's excited.  I know.  Bella, what do you think?  18?  He's good.  As long as he can prove it so I don't go to jail.  82.  82?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wait.  He just holds his eye out.  All right, Bella, hold on.  Rick's going to talk to you.  We'll set this up for later this week.  There you go.  Bella will get banged later on this week on the O&A show.  Cool.  Hey, this is Tracy Lewis. 
[01:52:00]  Before it's a news, the O&A's name, 1-A-2.7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, we're doing a live read for something, but I don't know.  I don't either.  Oh, here we go.  Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  When you're thinking of cheating on your husband, you're going to need a good bed, right?  Or a new bed when you're done, maybe even.  Oh, my God.  Imagine if she cheats on her own bed.  And you've got to sleep in another guy's sap. 
[01:52:30]  All right, hold on.  This guy's really pissed off.  Bitter.  What's the matter?  Yes.  Oh, it's a girl.  Bitter, what's up?  Don't you guys know that adultery is a crime in New York State?  You could actually serve time for that.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, I swear to God.  Look it up.  It's Dominic.  He'll tell you.  Yeah.  It's a crime when I've got to pay.  Tell me about it.  I don't think it's a crime.  I'm the bizarro Anthony.  I don't think it's a crime.  Hey, Bitter, don't ruin our contest.  Bella's going to get her banging.  Crime against God.  Look it up. 
[01:53:00]  Look it up.  All right.  Look it up.  Thank you.  Someone is saying Bella is scamming.  I'm on the air.  Frank.  Frank, you're on the air.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Opie?  Yeah.  Hey, don't you think this girl is scamming you?  Oh, we don't know.  We really don't know.  We'll find out when she gets there.  Think of that.  What woman, 5'7", 118 pounds, can't get laid?  Well, she's been married, so she hasn't cheated.  She's thinking of cheating now, so she's come to us.  Yeah, right.  She's got to come here.  And she's a professional. 
[01:53:30]  She's a doctor.  She's announcing on the radio her name.  I mean, her husband would get hair for money.  Yeah.  Right?  Maybe she's not a doctor, and maybe her name isn't Bella.  Right.  I don't know.  I bet she doesn't show.  It's all tricks of the trade.  Maybe she knows exactly what she's doing.  I doubt it.  What are we supposed to do?  Just tell her, don't show up?  Because you might be scamming us?  No.  Well, if we get scammed, we get scammed, but you've got to play it out. 
[01:54:00]  Either way, she's getting banged in a limo sometime this week.  No doubt.  By an 18- or 19-year-old guy.  She's 35.  Might as well take care of the ladies for once on our show.  There you go.  All right.  Well, I'll be happy to see her coming.  I know she's lying about something.  She's got to be.  Well, we'll find out when she gets here.  We have ways of making them talk and slipping up.  Yes.  Yes, you do.  All right, Frank.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  Rockaway Bedding, 1-800-TRI-BED.

[01:55:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  A bunch of people have problems with our new contest, Anthony.  The contest, Get Bella a Banging.  She's been married for 10 years.  Her husband hasn't touched her in over three.  Three years, right when she had that kid.  So she called us for help, and we figured we'd set her up a banging.  Preferably with another married, miserable F, or with a young stud, like an 18- or 19-year-old. 
[01:56:00]  She's like 35 and wants it back.  So who are we to say no, right?  Nice.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  Hi.  Yeah, guys, I don't have a problem with your contest, but I am a criminal justice major.  We were just discussing this in class the other day about how adultery and a lot of, you  know, old laws like that are still on the books in the majority of states.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:56:30]  Including New York.  I think we could get away with this one.  No, I'm...  Wouldn't the mayor be in jail?  Yeah.  Look, the mayor of New York.  You actually want to know something really funny.  About two and a half months ago, guess what finally was considered legal in New York State  and the majority of other states?  Oral sex?  Yeah, oral sex and anal sex.  And the anal.  They finally got rid of the sodomy laws.  And it's amazing, when they put it into work to get rid of the sodomy laws, it was right  after the Clinton debacle.  So now the sodomy is legal, huh? 
[01:57:00]  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  So, uh...  Good stuff.  VJ's for all.  What about the sex with animal thing?  Animals thing.  Yeah, I'm not sure about that.  I'll have to check my penal law.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  I've got to go listen to myself.  All right.  VJ has a problem with our contest, too.  VJ!  Oh, and hey, why don't you have something to share?  You know, like some HIV or something?  Well, that's what makes it fun.  Right.  You never know.  You never know.  Scrap shoot.  Matter of fact, it's the chance she's going to have to take.  I think it's our duty to get one guy in the studio that has the HIV. 
[01:57:30]  What if she has it?  And we don't tell her.  One of the guys.  One of the guys has the HIV.  And she's got a pick from the pool of guys that want to bang her and, you know.  She might decide to use a condom.  The guy might decide to use a condom.  The guy decides to use a condom.  What's that?  What guy decides to use a condom?  Yeah.  The guy decides.  I better use a condom.  Yeah, right.  Hello.  Wake up. 
[01:58:00]  Dreamy land.  Well, we'll make sure they practice the safe sex when they're banging.  That'll be up to them.  It's two adults.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's their decision.  Craig, what's going on?  What's up?  I'm 21 years old.  I'm 6'10", 280, and I work on elevators.  I'm down.  You're down?  I get it.  You're ready?  Yeah, I'm down.  You want in?  You want to bang Bella?  Hell yeah.  All right.  35 years old, 5'8", 5'7", 115, she said. 
[01:58:30]  118, something like that.  118?  Okay.  Well, the phone's an exploded.  I think we'll just invite everyone down and, you know, give her enough guys to choose from, right?  Yeah.  We'll have them lined up all the way down the hall.  I'll be straight over all of them.  So you can just pick who she wants?  I'll be straight over all of them, guys.  All right, Craig.  Hold on a line.  Did anyone get your info?  No, I'm not sure.  You're not sure?  Someone would have said, hey, what's your name and your phone number, no?  No, he didn't ask my phone number.  All right.  Hold on, okay?  All right.  Rick, are we writing down everyone's name and number? 
[01:59:00]  Yes, we are.  I think for this contest, we've got to get as many guys as possible.  I don't care if 100 guys show up, but we have to line them all the way down to Ken Stevens' office.  And Ken Stevens could be at the end of the line.  He may make it picked.  Never know.  Here he wants in on the contest.  Why not, right?  Pete.  Yeah.  What's up, bud?  You guys think it?  Oh, that's getting old.  That old gag. 
[01:59:30]  No, see, it's a lot different.  We do bangings on this show.  Right.  Ass munch.  Swear to God, we have to leave this place because I need to talk.  Mm-hmm.  It's not us preventing us from talking.  Right.  I'm willing to fight.  We need to be unleashed and unmuzzled.  Your hero's not willing to fight, douchebag.  Mm-hmm.  Don't get me started.  Oh, could you imagine? 
[02:00:00]  We're not the cowards.  You remember that.  You remember that.  We are not the cowards.  Oh, but you're hot when you're pissed.  Thank you.  They're dumping out of this, though, so no one heard what I...  I'm sure they are.  They don't.  I'll just keep saying until they play Van Halen.  We're willing to fight.  We're not the pussies.  We're not the cowards.  Mm-hmm.  Douchebag.  We have to leave. 
[02:00:30]  We have to leave.  Can't even hand out wow stickers anyway.  Oh, God.  I'm pissed.  Ronnie, what's going on?  I have a beef about your wow stickers.  Why?  Go ahead.  I'm 21.  I want to wow somebody so bad for like the last six months, and every man I see is over  50 with a wow sticker.  That's so not true, though.  Everywhere I go, I'm in the five boroughs everywhere.  Every man I see is like over 50.  Keep looking.  I see them...  It's horrible. 
[02:01:00]  I even have wow stickers on my car, and nobody's...  I'm looking for the girls.  No one's wowing me.  No one, huh?  What's wrong with this?  We've seen a lot of cars with wows on them, and there's people of all ages.  And what's wrong with wowing a guy that's in his 50s?  He needs it more than anybody.  This is true, but, you know, I'd rather do somebody else that's a little younger.  All right.  Well, keep looking.  I'm telling you.  I have to have you listen to this, you know?  Ronnie, we could go to the phones, and I could take 20 calls in a row from guys that are under  like 30 that have wow stickers, under 20. 
[02:01:30]  Well, let me know where they're at.  They're all over the place.  Keep looking.  I will.  You guys are great.  Just make sure you do some flashing for us out there, okay?  Definitely.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Our day will come.  That's for sure.  Oh, man.  When the muzzle's off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You want to see ugly?  You want to hear things that anybody that's familiar with this program will listen and go, 
[02:02:00]  oh, my God, this is all the stuff I was wondering why they weren't saying.  No, it'll come out.  Yeah.  I don't give a crap.  If it takes 20 years, it'll come out.  It'll come out in a fine little book.  The idea is for free.  That we'll give out for free.  I don't even need to make money, but someday the stories will be out there.  It could be on the airwaves, Opie.  That's what I'm saying.  You never know.  The stories.  I've just flat out had it.  I have hysterical bit ideas I would love to do. 
[02:02:30]  I want to thank Monster Magnet for having the balls to call into our show today, by the way.  Yeah.  Because we were also supposed to talk to Buck Cherry, both bands playing the Vanderbilt  on Long Island tonight.  What happened there, Opie?  Well, there's some politics going on.  All of a sudden, you know, Buck Cherry cannot be found, and, you know, people are running  around nervous because they don't want to piss off other people in this town.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  The Abercrombie and Fitch midget get involved once again.  But, no, the company wants us all to, you know, get along and be one happy family as 
[02:03:00]  we get F'd over and over again.  If you got on that show, you can't, we won't play your songs anymore.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, we've been pushing the Buck Cherry Monster Magnet show at the Vanderbilt.  It's happening tonight.  We're all going.  Tickets still available, I believe, or some anyway.  And, you know, both bands were definitely into calling our show.  Actually, they were supposed to hang out on our show.  So then all of a sudden it's like, well, there's a problem with them hanging. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  But I think I could get them to make a phone call.  I think.  I think, maybe.  Not really sure.  Things are happening that I can't really discuss.  You know, they're putting us in a bad situation.  And now, you know, night of the show, Monster Magnet, they're like, F you guys.  You know, I'm going to call the show.  And Dave did, and he was great.  But Buck Cherry is out there somewhere hiding.  Won't call.  Guaranteed. 
[02:04:00]  Because the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget got involved again.  But the company looks the other way.  We're muzzled.  You and him in 60 feet of water.  I want to see it.  I want to see it.  Slow motion brawl.  I would take that one to land, my friend.  We're taking this to land.  I would take that one to land, my friend.  We'll see what happens.  Got to be patient.  All things will come. 
[02:04:30]  So is Buck Cherry calling or not?  Nope.  No.  I don't think so.  Don't be silly.  Don't look like the stood-up guy with the hope.  She's going to call me.  Don't look silly.  I was even told they're, like, embarrassed about this, too.  Who's embarrassed?  Someone in the...  The management was just embarrassed.  You guys don't know...  You guys don't understand the politics that happened.  And we really can't get into it.  It's amazing.  They're embarrassed, and now they're hiding from the person that was going to get them to call. 
[02:05:00]  Legitimately hiding between 3 and 7.  Nice.  They were there early in the day.  And now they can't find them anywhere.  Oops.  And I'm pissed off at the record companies because they run around scared.  Like, guys, I know you guys are big fans of Green Day and stuff, but if we put them on your show, then blah, blah, won't be playing their records.  And they also threaten that not only will they not play their records, they'll tell all the other program directors they know of across America not to play the record.  Is any band or management buying that load of crap? 
[02:05:30]  They'll play the songs.  They will play the band.  There's no way they can't play them.  This is the crap that goes on, though.  They'll play them every day because that's all you hear, the same effing songs every goddamn day.  What, are they going to pull it out?  They won't have anything to put in there.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, I think the only thing worse than hearing you guys complain about the other stations is having them dump every five minutes out of it.  Well, you know, Bill, every time they dump, you can figure out exactly who we're talking about. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know.  They're going crazy on the button these days, guys.  Because it's been the same problem since we started here.  Yes.  I hear you.  I'll be close in line to get the book.  All right.  We're in this, like, we're in this bizarre situation here at WNAW.  They don't want to help our careers, but they don't want us going anywhere else.  They don't want us to sit here and do the same thing over and over again.  That's exactly what they want from the Opie and Anthony show.  We're a little dangerous elsewhere.  It's very nice that we're here and we're adhering to certain rules and we're in a position where we can't talk about things because there's people down the hall that punch buttons. 
[02:06:30]  So it's safe.  We are the caged tiger.  You could poke it with a stick, Opie.  You poke it with a stick.  It'll growl.  It'll yell.  But all you got to do is step back.  It can't slot at me.  But if someone comes along and opens the cage, then we can attack.  Grr!  I am convinced, and this is no bit, and I know the bosses are listening. 
[02:07:00]  I am so convinced that they don't want us at WNAW, but they don't want us anywhere else.  Crouching Opie, hitting Anthony.  Look out.  They don't know what to do with us.  Yeah.  They don't want to help us out in any way as we sit here and rot.  And they certainly don't want us going, as they say in the business, across the street.  Oh, no.  That wouldn't be a good thing. 
[02:07:30]  Could you imagine the unmuzzled bits we can come up with?  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm tired of hearing you guys complain about this other show.  Why don't you guys just come up with some sort of code word?  You guys refer to all sorts of stuff that you can't talk about.  You guys know, but you know what we're talking about.  And I understand you guys are sick of hearing it, but this crap goes on every day.  Today's problem is all we want to do is talk to Buck Cherry.  We're fans of Buck Cherry.  We're helping Buck Cherry sell tickets tonight for their show on Long Island.  And the Abercrombie and Fitch midget freaking prevented us from talking to Buck Cherry. 
[02:08:00]  I'm convinced of it.  You want a suggestion for Code Word?  Oh, we have.  They dump out of Code Word.  They dump out of everything.  We've had Code Word.  I was going to say, I was...  That'll be dumb.  They dumped out of that.  It's a good line, but they dumped out of it.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Bye.  And SNL is pretty funny these days.  And you've got to do a live brief because I need to make a call.  Dead serious.  All right.  Because I ain't waiting until I cool down. 
[02:08:30]  I'll be back.  Give me a commercial.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  What, are you crazy?  Hold on.  You mother-effort piece of crap.  Somebody stop it.  Stop it.  Damn you.  Shut up, you bitch.  Boy.  Yeah.  Chuck it.  Come here.  I'm sorry. 
[02:09:00]  Boy.  Stop, stop, stop, stop it.  Somebody stop it.  Jamila.  Andrew.  Me, Dale.  Chuck the, Chuck the, Chuck the, Chuck the, Chuck.  It's not the truck.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Shuttle, you a fool.  What, are you crazy? 
[02:09:30]  What, are you crazy?  What, are you crazy?  7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  What is this, sports guys?  Only guys, now we've got to find a stand-in for Opie.  What, is he still on the phone?  Is he, what's he doing?  He's yelling, Rob.  He's yelling?  Yeah, we have audio.  Good.  Oh, God.  Yeah, hang up.  After the phone, they'll sound like, here he comes. 
[02:10:00]  No.  Oh.  What happened there?  You got to make a, you got to drop a dime?  Oh, yeah.  A little phone call?  Oh, yeah.  Feeling better?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Someone's effed.  Good.  Because we nailed him this time.  Nailed you, you midget.  You got to play by the same dopey rules they laid out.  With the behind-the-scenes phone call crap, instead of just addressing it out in the open. 
[02:10:30]  Nelson's hi, by the way.  Hey, what's up?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  And then we danced.  Dan from Hoboken.  Quick, Jesse, here's your chance for airtime.  All right, we got to move on.  You got a problem, sister? 
[02:11:00]  All right, where were we, Ant?  I believe we were just wrapping up about the whole Abella thing.  You know Abella.  Yeah, we're getting the contact numbers for all the guys who want to bang Bella?  Mm-hmm.  Right?  How many you got?  What?  How many you got?  Like 50 already?  3-4-5-6-7-9-10-1-1-12-13-14-14-14-14-14-14.  About 17 guys.  Bella gangbang. 
[02:11:30]  How about that?  Right?  How would she like that?  Going from not having sex in three years to 30 guys.  Leaving like a glazed donut.  Nice.  We can make that happen.  What else were we going to talk about today?  Well, we covered a lot of our ground today, and then we had a blowout.  So now I'm kind of boggled. 
[02:12:00]  This is the mellow.  You're the mellow.  Now, what happened?  Taking care of business.  I took care of business.  You made a phone call.  It was a very good.  And everything's fine.  A very good phone call.  All right.  I used the bat phone.  You used the bat phone?  Yeah.  The secret number?  No, I wasn't effing around.  I wasn't going to, you know, play with Jeremy or anybody.  Oh, boy.  All right.  So the big door.  Oh, boy.  You know the phone in the office that has the glass over it that we have to break? 
[02:12:30]  Commissioner Gordon.  In an emergency?  Shh.  Wow.  Well, you just got to dial three letters on the phone?  That phone?  That phone?  That phone.  With no secretary?  Don't have to go through a secretary.  All right, right.  Nice.  We'll play. 
[02:13:00]  I'm ready to play.  We'll play your cute little game.  That's how they want to play, so.  All right.  All right.  We got to get rid of all the people that want Bella.  Are we getting all these people's phone numbers?  Yes.  Everyone on hold, we got their information before I hang up?  Uh-huh.  David, I'm going to hang up on you.  You want to bang Bella, right?  Yeah, I want to bang Bella.  All right.  Well, did someone get your info?  Not yet.  Oh, all right.  Hold on.  Just have Stinky get all these people's phone numbers and info, and then we'll hang up.  Got to get all the guys that we can for Bella. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug, what's going on?  We've got to get the show back on the tracks here.  Hey, ONA, what's going on?  Hey.  I know Abby.  I went out with Abby like two weeks ago, and it was like the first night she went out  with my friend Pete, and she like banged her.  Banged him, I should say.  Remember me, Abby?  Who is this?  It's just Doug.  Doug, Doug, Doug.  I don't know Doug.  You were up in my room.  I was playing Steven Lynch songs on the guitar.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:14:00]  Wait, you're playing Steven Lynch songs on your guitar to get some pooh-ha.  Nice.  No, I need no pooh-ha for her.  Why not?  Because I got my own pooh-ha.  She was hitting on me the whole night in front of my girlfriend, too.  That was nice.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I was hitting on you all night when I was there with Pete, and just, you know,  I haven't had sex in quite a while, and Pete was not the luggy one who got a hold of me,  so.  Oh.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  You didn't have sex with Pete?  No, I did not have sex with Pete.  Really?  Really.  Pete says different, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, he sure does.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, because guys will do that.  I say it all the time.  It sucks for the girls, but guys will do that.  You didn't have sex with Pete?  No, I did not have sex with Pete.  You're not just saying this because your father's listening?  If I had sex with somebody, I'd say it, but I did not have sex with him.  When was the last time you asked him?  Well, Pete's quite a bit older than that.  How old?  21.  Old.  Nice.  So, what was the last time that went?  Probably January.  January?  What are you waiting for?  I mean, what? 
[02:15:00]  The right guy you're kind of looking for?  You're just meeting up with a bunch of a-holes?  I mean, what's the...  I don't know.  I'm just...  Not...  When do you decide to give it up?  I don't know.  It's just I have to really be in the mood for it, and Pete wasn't doing it for me.  Wow.  No, huh?  And...  All right, Doug, so Pete told you that he banged her?  Yeah, well, according to him, her hand was down his pants all night.  Oh, yeah.  And in the club we were at, right?  When we were in front of, like, 500 people?  Yeah.  Now, do you consider sex just sex?  Like, you know... 
[02:15:30]  Sex.  What about BJ?  That's not sex.  Okay.  And when was the last time about?  January.  I broke up with my last boyfriend in January, and I haven't really been with anybody since.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And then some girls don't consider a balloon nut sex.  You know, back action.  Any of that since January?  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Ah.  Precious a daisy. 
[02:16:00]  So, it's been January, then.  January.  And nothing looking up in the future as far as prospects?  There's a couple.  There's a couple, but nothing else.  Wow.  Got to take that Ferrari out of the garage.  Let's see.  No.  Yo, guys.  My other phone was in the car and said that she had Pete to go get some condoms, so I don't  know why she would want to be doing that if she didn't want to have any sex.  Is that true?  Is it true that I asked him to go get condoms?  Yeah.  It's more true that I was trying to get rid of his friend.  Oh. 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  Wow.  What a way to do that.  Not because I didn't like him, just because he and I were supposed to go out, and we ended  up going to a bar, which was fine.  We went to go see a band play, and then when we go home, it's like,  I don't really want somebody sitting in the backseat of the car where he's dropping me  off, you know, waiting for him to get a ride home, so just trying to get rid of the friend.  All right.  There you have it.  So he's there with his friend?  Yeah.  What's that all about?  Trying to get action.  With his friend in the car? 
[02:17:00]  Yep.  You drop your friend off, or at least your friend is supposed to go, hey, I see you got  something going here, you know.  Yeah, you find a 7-Eleven and kick his door.  Kick him out.  That's no friend.  That's an ass.  That was always the way.  You know, I'm starting to get flashbacks of remembering this with a friend that wouldn't  leave the goddamn car.  Joe Curry.  All right, Doug, I'm going to block her. 
[02:17:30]  Thanks for getting my story straight.  All right, bye.  Do that.  Yeah, we got Abigail in the studio.  She just turned 17.  When she turns 18, she wants to be on the lesbian couch.  Yeah.  But you're out drinking in bars and everything?  No, I wasn't drinking.  It's 18 and over.  Ah.  But you don't drink?  Um, I don't drink unless I'm home, like, or unless I'm in a place where I know I'm not  going to be doing stupid stuff, because I'm not really big into drinking.  You've got to get into that.  Faith, what's going on? 
[02:18:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Faith, what's up?  Hey.  This is my sister.  No sex since January?  Ooh, you lie.  Oh.  Oh, the sister has a different story.  Faith, how old are you?  You don't want to be pulling stories out of the closet, because I was in Mexico with you,  dear.  You do not want to start.  Faith, how old are you?  I don't know what goes on.  How old are you?  You don't have to tell me anything.  Faith, how old are you?  How old am I?  Yeah.  I'm 20.  20?  You're 20.  Does she look like you, or?  No.  No, we look nothing alike. 
[02:18:30]  She's taller than I am, and she's got a bigger rack than I do, and she's got red hair  along to her shoulders.  Yeah.  But you're saying she had sex since January.  Faith?  Hello.  Yeah, when did she have sex?  She's nervous now.  No, I can't hear, because they've got the big radio on, and I'm like, yes.  Well, tell them to turn it off, or tape it or something.  All right, we're in the other room.  It's good news.  All right.  So you're saying that your sister Abigail had sex since January?  Huh?  They're saying, they're asking you, have I had sex since January? 
[02:19:00]  Do you know this?  I don't know for a fact.  Oh, all right.  All right.  Well, thank you for nothing.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I couldn't make your day more amusing.  No, she knows the truth, but she won't say it, because...  You have dirt on her.  I have dirt on her.  Oh, so the truth is that you have had sex since January.  I'm not saying a word.  Well, not with Pete.  I'm not going to say it.  Oh, okay.  We just keep our dirt on each other private.  All right, man.  That's all.  All right.  Makes way more...  Hey, hey.  Are you working?  No, I'm out of work.  Yeah, Faith, why didn't you come in here? 
[02:19:30]  Because I had to work all day.  I got out of work at like, well, after four o'clock.  Yeah.  All right, next time, okay?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Bye.  Hmm.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey.  What's up, Jimmy?  Listen to me.  Both of these girls are lying.  Why?  Absolutely can tell.  First, I'm sorry, Abigail.  You're probably a nice girl or whatever.  But she's lying through her teeth.  She's going to get into a whole bunch of trouble when this other guy gets to her.  I don't even ask what this other guy says to me. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  You're lying, girly.  You really don't.  And before your sister got on, I was praying you put me on the air so I could say that you're lying.  You're lying.  And so's Bella.  Bella's story.  You want to hear what I got on Bella?  Yeah, Bella's the lady that wants to get banged.  Bella's lying.  She's probably been cheating on her husband the whole damn time.  But now her husband did something.  So now she's going to make it public that she's going to go and cheat on the guy.  I'm telling you, both of these girls can't trust none of them.  And what is this, oh, not really? 
[02:20:30]  When the question was, have you had sex?  How does not really know if you had sex or not?  Well, some guys think things are sex, but they're really not.  Because when a guy is too...  Yeah, all right.  You're lying.  Listen, I've got to go to work.  All I know is that they're both lying.  Don't believe nobody.  All right, Jimmy.  Take it easy.  You guys are great.  We're going to find out about Bella.  Where are we going?  Did you read that?  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, you guys did a new room?  I'm sorry?  No.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  I want to be cremated. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you, guys.  That's so bad.  It's funny.  It's worse than my Martian joke.  I want to be cremated.  Adrian.  Yo, Abigail.  Yes.  Listen, I just talked to your father.  Oh, great.  He said to make sure you put him in for the bell contest.  I told you he'd want to come.  He wants to be in it.  Oh, yeah.  I'll make sure that they, well, I'll try and make sure that they.  Yeah, your dad in the Bella contest, you think?  Well, get your dad to call the show. 
[02:21:30]  That could be good.  We'll get your dad to bang Bella.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you guys will roll with Chuck.  He's a wild one.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Thank you, Adrian.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye, hon.  Bye.  And let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to get the 20-year-old sister, 17-year-old sister, both on the couch, same time, right  now.  All right.  We'll make that happen just for you, Mike.  Okay. 
[02:22:00]  Jack Hayes.  Thank you.  What an idiot.  He called you an S-head.  I did.  I heard that.  I haven't heard the S-head in a while.  You S-head.  All right.  Oh, don't get mad at the friggin' Ramones remark.  People are so sensitive.  Meanwhile, remember I was telling you earlier, I was going to say, not enough time has passed  by, Anthony.  Right.  Not enough time has passed.  It's only been a day.  But as time goes on, then the jokes come out, just like everything else.  And driving home from my mom's house from Easter, there's one of those fairs going on 
[02:22:30]  where they got the big Ferris wheel and whatnot.  And there I see this huge inflatable Titanic, tipped up like it's sinking into the ground.  It's a big ship.  And it's inflated.  And you know what it's for?  Kids climb up it and slide down the deck.  Get out of here.  And there's smokestacks that they bounce off of as they slide down. 
[02:23:00]  Dude, it's an amusement park ride type thing that is based on the way people had a horrific death.  Kids just get on.  Whee, look, I'm falling down the deck of the Titanic as it sinks, bouncing off the cones.  That's the latest ride at all the county fairs this summer, huh?  It seems like the kids love it.  Because I haven't seen that one yet.  Based on a huge tragedy, huge loss of life, and probably the people that died the most horrifically on that ship 
[02:23:30]  falling down the deck as it tipped up to nose under.  And there it is.  There's a big inflatable back of the Titanic with kids just falling down it.  Goes back to what we have said many times in the show.  Enough time goes by.  Anything could be funny.  Oh, yeah.  You'll see a space shuttle.  The space shuttle ride?  The space shuttle ride.  Why not?  It shoots you up. 
[02:24:00]  You get a little blast.  Like a great adventure?  Yeah, and then you fall into the water.  There'll be a free fall drop?  Why not?  A passenger seat with Dale Earnhardt.  You'll see that.  You race around the track, and then you hit a wall with Dale.  They probably have the music playing while the kids are sliding down the Titanic.  Whee!  Whee!  Look, I'm bouncing off of the steps!  And my child that I've had with Renee as I place her on the deck to slide down and bounce off the steps like all of the people that did not survive. 
[02:24:30]  She's giggling because it is so funny because it happened in the time of the black and white.  The world was not in color back then.  It's so sick!  Jim, what's going on?  You know, I was at a birthday party with a bunch of six or seven-year-old kids with one of my cousins, and they had that Titanic thing there. 
[02:25:00]  You can rent that, and it costs like $500 for like three, four hours to rent that thing.  It blows up, and it looks like it's sinking into your lawn or whatever it is.  It's only part of it.  You can rent it for the kid's party?  Yeah.  You can rent it for a birthday party for kids.  As a matter of fact, the first time I saw it was on a plane, I saw it in Maxim magazine.  No way.  How about that, see?  It's out there, and it seems to be a popular attraction.  What about the Holocaust disco?  Yeah, well, they have the Hindenburg bed, too.  It blows up and stuff.  It's great.  Yeah, why not have a big Hindenburg ride where when all of a sudden you touch the ground and blow up? 
[02:25:30]  You guys are great.  This guy is saying that he's seen Hindenburg rides.  No, stop.  Stop.  You're busting her nuts or what?  What's this?  You.  Are you busting her nuts?  No, man.  All right.  I live right down near Lakehurst.  There's blimps on everything.  That's where the Hindenburg blew up.  Yeah, and what, do they have a ride?  No, but I mean, there's like blimps on the cop cars.  There's blimps on the hotels down there.  Blimps on everything.  Oh, it's like a big attraction. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's their claim to fame.  Their big claim to fame.  Hmm.  All right.  Yeah, what about the disco they made out of one of the concentration camp buildings?  Yeah, by Auschwitz, I believe.  They had to take it down because of the outrage.  You don't want a disco at a concentration camp.  Although I have an attraction that me and Renee are trying to sell.  Well, it is by Camel Toll Log Flume.  It is great.  Celine songs play as you take the log through my... 
[02:26:30]  Oh, where?  Wow!  And the climax of the ride, as you go over my bunt, you slide down my Camel Toll in a big splash.  I'm trying to market that one, me and Renee.  So did you see this ride set up at one of the county fairs, or was it on the back of a truck?  Yes, the Camel Toll ride.  Oh, the Titanic.  Yeah, the Titanic.  Yeah, it was set up. 
[02:27:00]  Kids were sliding down the deck.  They're sliding.  That's messed up.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  How about the John Denver experience from South Park?  Yeah, I guess they touched on that whole subject, the John Denver ride, right?  All right, for John Denver experience.  Yep.  I love that.  Here's a picture of it.  You got a picture of it?  Here's a picture of it.  Here's the Titanic.  It even says Titanic Liverpool.  It's big. 
[02:27:30]  It's inflatable.  And look, see?  There it is.  Look, look.  It's sinking into the grass.  And you slide down.  You bounce all over the towers.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  It's on a blue map.  More Titanic views.  To represent the ocean.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Titanic.  Here you are walking up the stairs.  Uh-huh.  And then you slide down.  Oh, my God.  That is messed up.  Is that wrong?  What website is that?  I don't know.  AmericanCarnival.com. 
[02:28:00]  There it is.  AmericanCarnival.com.  This guy's saying the ride's been around for two and a half years.  Where have we been?  Pete, what's up?  Yeah.  I saw that ride about two and a half, three years ago.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  AmericanCarnival.com.  All right.  Abigail, your dad's on the line.  Pop?  Yeah.  Hey, Abigail's dad.  Hi, Dad.  How's it going, troops?  Good.  She's behaving herself as she celebrates her 17th birthday with us.  I got to tell you guys, I'm learning way too much on the O&A show today. 
[02:28:30]  Don't listen.  It's like, you got to listen, you got to tape.  I mean.  So what do you think?  Do you think your daughter was doing something with Pete or what?  I don't know about Pete, but I think I'm the only one who didn't get any action in Mexico.  Oh.  You all went to Mexico?  Yeah, we went to Sonora Beach.  Did you get anything in Mexico?  Was he American or Mexican?  No Mexicans.  Thank you.  There you go.  Pops, what's going on in your family?  Your daughters are going out to Mexico with you and they're getting banged and nothing for dad. 
[02:29:00]  No, it just works that way sometimes.  You know, I party earlier now.  You know, if that sperm cell next to the one that made her would have hip-checked the other one,  it could have been his son.  You wouldn't have to worry about this.  No.  My God.  You give them all the information you can, you load them up, and you send them out.  You load them up.  And you hope for the best?  Yeah, that's it, man.  Any of your friends trying to bang your daughter? 
[02:29:30]  No.  No?  Yeah, you just don't know of.  Yeah, not that I know of.  Oh, guys.  Yeah.  And the young lady that I spoke about, Christine, who wants to come down with Abby on her 18th birthday,  spoke to her online today.  Wait, you're setting up the lesbian act that your daughter's going to go through, right?  Yeah.  I'm not setting it up.  It's all set.  No, she's a secretary at one of the places that he works, and she had been saying that she wanted to go,  and he mentioned it to her one day that I wanted to go also, 
[02:30:00]  and then when she came to our house for my dad was going to a wedding,  we agreed that we would do it on my 18th birthday.  Do you find your daughter hot?  Do I?  Oh, please do not answer this, Dad.  I thought it was very attractive, but, I mean, she doesn't do anything for me.  Really?  No, I mean, it's...  But you're setting her up with a lesbian experience.  Hey, man, I don't set the rules anymore.  What the hell did my dad get me for my 18th birthday? 
[02:30:30]  Hey, Opie, you were talking earlier about how old you were when Abby was being born?  No, that was when I started my radio career, yeah.  Well, I was probably in college about the time you were being born.  All right, well, all right.  And to the young...  It's not as hot.  It's all relative, I guess.  Yeah.  But to the young lady who called earlier and just can't find anybody to wow,  tell her, I got a wow on the back of my helmet,  I got a wow on my truck,  and there would be nothing nicer than to have somebody brighten up my day on the way home. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  There's a guy on the line that's saying you're an animal.  Hold on a minute.  Uh-oh.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Are you out of your mind?  And you don't talk about your kids having sex.  There are some things that are just sacred.  Okay.  What kind of parent do you?  You get on the radio and you talk about your daughter having sex.  She's 17 years old.  Well, what about your parents, Steve?  Did they have sex?  It has nothing to do with what about my parents.  You don't talk about your daughter that way.  Well, when you were trying to get it,  I'm sure you didn't want your parents to know about it. 
[02:31:30]  The difference between you and your parents and me and my dad  is that I'm smart enough to be able to talk to him about it,  and I'm not going to end up with bumps or hives or herps or whatever else.  He educated me on what to do,  and I play it smart instead of having to hide from my father.  Playing it smart?  You don't broadcast it on the radio.  That's just such white...  Oh, maybe Mom and Dad should have spent more time with you, Potty Mouth.  Shut up, you'll reenie.  All right, Steve, thank you.  I was following everybody until we discovered  Abigail's dad is setting up the lesbian experience. 
[02:32:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  Opie and Anthony set it up.  I'm not going to be...  I can't even listen that day, guys.  But you got one of your secretaries involved.  No, she's a young lady who works at a company who...  Is that what you're getting your secretary for Secretary's Day, your daughter?  Saves money on flowers, man.  Jeez.  I got to admit, that was just a little strange.  Just a tad.  Just a tad?  It's a tad, but I mean, this young lady is smoking hot. 
[02:32:30]  And, uh...  Which, your daughter or the secretary?  The secretary.  Thank you for verifying that one.  So, and, uh...  And you guys all discussed this already.  Well, I wasn't part of the discussion.  Well, you kind of set it up, though.  You asked the secretary.  Well, Christine is a huge O&A fan.  She turned me on to Foundry before you guys really talked about it much.  Foundrymusic.com.  Anna Kornikova.  Topless pictures today.  There you go.  Yeah, 297.  You're in.  Been there. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you.  Free pics.  Yeah, the sample pics are free.  Yeah, there's some, uh...  Yeah.  Shows her rolling over, and she's on all fours, and her cans are kind of hanging out.  Yeah, the sample pics are good enough for me.  I don't even need to pay the money.  We figured someone out...  A bunch of people out there will be fine with just the freebie.  I've spanked out many a batch to free sample pics, so, you know.  Don't have to pay for it.  So, Dad, which daughter's hotter?  Abigail or Faith?  Yeah.  Oh, man, that's a tough call.  Come on.  I mean, they're both good-looking kids.  I mean... 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  And they're very, very different.  There you go.  Abigail resembles me a little bit more, and...  Wow, you've got nice cans.  Thank you.  That was great.  Oh, man.  Actually, the other one resembles her mom, and they're huge.  So, your other daughter has the bigger boobs.  Yeah.  Much, much, much bigger.  All right, Dad, this is very strange. 
[02:34:00]  Half the calls are saying you're the greatest dad ever, and the other half want to pretty  much wring your neck.  Yeah, well, you know what?  There's no in-between with these people today.  Let me put Matt on the line with you.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  Hey, listen.  I got a daughter.  She's kind of young.  I want to find out, at what point did you start talking to Abigail about all this, so  that she's kind of cool with it and knows what to do, as her words.  I knew about sex when I was in first grade.  My father let me know what there was to know about it, and pretty much any time I had a 
[02:34:30]  question about anything, or any time I had problems with anything, I could just ask my  father without feeling embarrassed about it, and he'd let me know what was up.  But what did he say?  Like, how did he approach you?  Wait, you're scared to talk to your daughter about sex?  It's just that...  Have her mom do it.  No.  God, no.  No.  No.  No.  She would turn her into a refrigerator.  Turn her into a prude?  No.  How old's your daughter?  Six.  Wow.  Six.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you got some time. 
[02:35:00]  I know.  That's why I want to start, you know, thinking about how to approach it now.  You got a few years.  Help me out here.  Help me out.  Can I chime in a minute?  Lock her in the closet until she's 30.  Yeah, go ahead.  Abigail's dad.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  We don't want to turn this into a Dr. Ruth show, but you can start talking at six years  old about the dangers of sex, the responsibility involved with it.  You know, it's not like when we were a kid, or when I was a kid, I mean, the worst thing 
[02:35:30]  you worried about was getting a girl pregnant.  We can indeed turn this into a Dr. Ruth show.  I believe even 17 is good enough for the lesbian couch.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Look for my new book, Anal for Dummies.  A little reference.  Dr. Ruth kicked your butt, too.  Keep talking.  Keep talking.  I'm listening.  You just start talking in generalities.  You don't have to get down to the slot A, tab B stuff.  Hey, nice.  I'm done now.  All right, Chuck.  Thanks, Dad.  I appreciate it.  Matt, thank you. 
[02:36:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Wow.  This guy says Chuck is the greatest dad ever.  Let's put Joe in the line.  Well, to everybody else.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Wouldn't you love to have this guy as a dad for your girlfriend?  Most dads, they'll, you know, check in in your room every once in a while and make sure  no funny business is going on.  This guy, hey, go ahead.  I'm not allowed to be in my room with the door closed with the guy.  That's a strict rule.  And it's respect.  Well, he wants to watch.  What about it?  Oh, that was wrong.  Oh, that's wrong, Chuck.  That was wrong. 
[02:36:30]  You ever walk around the house with the panties on?  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm talking to your father.  Oh.  Do you ever?  Oh.  Have you been walking around and stuff?  I walk around in, like, brown underwear or a T-shirt and underwear.  Hey, Chuck, can we make believe that it's, I don't know, 11 o'clock at your house and  Abigail needs a snack?  Would you mind?  She has to walk around now.  Get a refrigerator.  You guys are on your own with her. 
[02:37:00]  She's a handful, dude.  Two handfuls from the look right here.  Didn't need to know that.  Can we play?  It's snack time?  All right, you go for it.  You brought pajamas?  I brought pajamas.  I don't sleep in pajamas.  I don't sleep in really anything.  Did you just hear the groan from the outside?  That was stinky.  I just heard stinky.  She goes, I don't sleep in like nothing.  And the stinky goes, aww.  Someone get some Formula 405 for the keyboard out there. 
[02:37:30]  Well, why don't we take a break and we'll play it's snack time.  And she's going to get in her PJs.  Yeah.  And then she'll come walking into an imaginary refrigerator, maybe the cart rack.  And get a snack, all sleepy, all sleepy, rubbing your eyes and stuff.  Is that all right, Chuck?  Playing the part of the snack, stinky schlong.  Hey, stinky rules.  You keep stinky out of there. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  All right, Joe, thank you.  All right, ready, guys?  We have one more call for Chuck.  Let me go to Michael.  Michael, you're on with Chuck, Abigail's dad.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing, Mike?  Good.  It sounds very interesting, but, I mean, are you, you know, it sounds like you're banging  your daughter.  Oh, my God.  No way.  No, come on.  I mean, you sound very cool and everything, but, you know, you got two hot daughters.  You're talking about your daughter's boobs and everything.  I know what this is all about. 
[02:38:30]  I figured it out a while ago.  What's that?  Mommy's not around, if I remember correctly.  Yeah, Mom's not around.  Abigail's dad, Chuck, is loving life because Abigail is bringing her hot friends over all  the time, and Chuck gets to take a peek.  You got it.  Well, that sounds good, but he doesn't let the daughter close the door with the guy in  the room, but he lets the daughter be with the guy no matter what, you know, so he's  just like you said.  Not in my bedroom.  Not in my bedroom.  Right.  Why?  Because he can't watch.  It's a matter of respect.  It's respect.  Do you have a pool in your yard?  No, we live in a condom complex. 
[02:39:00]  I am buying you a pool.  Where's the respect?  How is that respect?  You can bang them, but you can't bang them into your own room?  You can bang them down to Disney.  Yeah.  Hey, Michael.  I live in a one-story house.  I live in a house that has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and it's just a hallway, and  I don't have any place to go that I could hide anything from my father.  Exactly.  Let's not get stupid.  Abigail's not banging guys in the house when the dad's there.  Did any of us? 
[02:39:30]  All right.  Well, I mean, that sounds cool, but how do you get on the list, though?  Yeah, you jerk.  No, I'm serious.  I thought I told you to shut up.  You're going to reen it.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Chuck.  Okay.  Abigail's going to get her PJs on.  You guys are the best.  You know what?  No, no.  You're the best.  No, sir.  We're going to buy you beers for the rest of your life. 
[02:40:00]  We should give him, like, a free beer card.  So every listener of this show that's a bartender has to, like, give Chuck free beer.  Ugh.  Always.  I'd rather talk with Bella.  We're going to try to set you up with Bella.  We'll see if that's a bro-o-one.  Joe, real fast, because we've got to take a break.  Hello?  Joe, go.  Hey, I'm a friend of Abby's, and I know Chuck.  Hey, Joey.  I know Joe.  He's a real cool guy.  I think he's a great dad.  He's raised two wonderful girls, and they're really cool. 
[02:40:30]  Joe, sex with Abigail, yes or no?  Quick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It never happened.  It never happened.  Oh, it never happened?  No, he's too good of a friend, so it would be kind of weird.  Yeah, he's a really good friend of mine.  Too good of a friend.  Do you give him a peek every once in a while and just say no?  Sex with Faith, Joe, yes or no?  Oh, yeah.  Sex with Chuck.  I don't know.  Take a few beers for that one.  Take a few beers.  We found out he has nice boobs.  I mean, what the hell?  You know, I don't know.  All right, Joe.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  We have to take a break, Anthony. 
[02:41:00]  Yes.  Chuck, we're going to let you go for now, okay?  All right, guys.  Carry on.  You'll have to come in and see us someday.  Bye, Daddy.  You promised.  Bye, Daddy.  Listen to us.  I'm going out to dinner, Dad.  So I'm going to be home a little bit later.  I'm going to go out with Brian.  In Jersey?  To Hell's Kitchen.  Oh, boy.  You call me when you leave there.  Okay.  All right.  Love you, baby.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm going to be home a little bit later.  I'm looking for a toilet train and books.  Everybody poops is still the standard, of course.  We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.  What can't work so well? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, then you want your anomaly child and a concentrated evil coming out the back of you.  We hope we ain't happen to show.  I need to go pooping.  Here is our friend, Mark Griffin.  Hey, Rick.  Hi.  It was about a month after the Redskins had won the Super Bowl when he was the Super Bowl MVP. 
[02:42:00]  And, you know, being the supreme jock sniffer that I am, I said, where is your Super Bowl MVP trophy?  And he just, he waved a hand towards the other room and he said, it's right over there.  It's in there.  It's in that room.  Go ahead.  To be honest with you, I don't know where it is right now.

Anthony, Planet Java.  Iced coffee just got cool.  When I was making that very important phone call about a half hour ago?  Yeah.  I sat back, put my feet up on the big desk, dialed the number and cracked open a Planet Java. 
[02:43:30]  What, a tremble so you'd be all nice and shaky?  No, I had to go with the Java Delic.  Like a grown-up milkshake to show that you were a grown-up.  You were handling it in a grown-up way.  It was quite good.  Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java, it ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  I don't even know what that means.  How could iced coffee let you be yourself?  You know, we don't need a script.  It's really basic.  I mean, the stuff is better than Starbucks. 
[02:44:00]  I used to drink the Starbucks.  I got sick of it.  Planet Java came along.  And there's something about Planet Java that I really, really like.  And they got three flavors.  The Java Delic, the Karamocha, and the Tremble, which is like just off the hook, yo, a delicious kick in the ass is what they should call it.  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country right now.  So if you're looking for that boost, you should try the Tremble, all right?  And Karamocha makes a great mixer.  Yeah, the packaging is cool.  They got trucks all over the tri-state area giving, you know, tastes out there. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  So you can try it for yourself.  And I believe Planet Java is sold wherever, like, Coca-Cola products are sold.  Am I right?  Yeah, and if your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, get Planet Java.  Damn you.  Iced coffee just got cool.  And it's called Planet Java.  Try it for yourself.  Planet Java.  Opie and Anthony show.  The sickest, most disgusting people having sick sex.  Something could help us continue being number one, right?  Yeah.  That means beautiful. 
[02:45:00]  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Abigail back in the studio with a very conservative look, Anthony.  Yes, it's not that wild of a PJ look.  It's her nightwear.  It's the same top she had on.  Ten top.  Oh, it's not?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Okay.  And, uh, PJ.  Long PJs.  Yeah, she's got a, what is that, like a, you know what that?  Victoria's Secret PJs. 
[02:45:30]  They're almost, almost see-through.  They are see-through.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  They're see-through.  How about that?  How about that?  Dice.  Huh?  And then we dance.  And then everybody dance.  Dance.  You know what I mean?  We don't have much time today, Dice, because we're, uh, almost out of here.  What does that mean?  What time is it?  We were hoping you would call earlier.  We got like five, ten hours.  I had to do a thing. 
[02:46:00]  It's all right.  Hey, we had a great time, uh, uh, Saturday night.  Okay, so did I.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Anthony, what happened to you?  I had, uh, I had to go somewhere.  Well, why?  What was your rush?  I stayed, I stayed for the show, Dice.  Yeah, but you didn't even get, I introduced Opie and Anthony, and there's one.  Yeah.  Right.  There's one.  One gets up.  I asked the guy next to me, could you just stand for a second?  No one will know the difference.  Yeah, just have some guys stand up.  Right, like.  No, he was there for just about the whole show.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, but the point is, I introduced you guys.  I mean, you, you know, you guys helped me out.  We do a whole thing together.  Right.  Well, how about you?  You know what I mean?  How about you?  And the governor had other plans.  I had a previous engagement, Dice.  How about you introduce us a little earlier next time?  Oh, but don't you know, you saved the best for us.  Yeah.  And then everybody, and so I introduced Opie, and everybody dance.  That's right.  Hey, you had one of your fans there, that blonde-headed rag that was sitting in front 
[02:47:00]  of Opie and Rick and everybody?  Yeah, what happened?  She's a filthy animal.  Why?  She spit on Rick and Rick's wife and...  Timmy from Survivor.  And Timmy from Survivor.  Yeah.  There had to be a reason.  She's a Dice fan.  She probably didn't have a napkin or something.  Yeah, I was a...  You know what I mean?  I was off the hook.  Yeah, I heard, like.  She just started spitting at you.  She was nasty.  Yeah, we told the story earlier.  She was just out of her mind.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  That's not right, you know.  I should give out, like, bags for that.  You should have her rejected from the audience.  You know what I mean?  She probably got all excited looking at me in the Superman outfit.  You know, I started talking about this earlier.  It was a little weird to see you without your Superman clothes on.  What do you mean?  Without your superhero clothes.  Oh, really?  Back in the hotel.  We were doing, like, the little after-hours party.  When I was in my panties.  It's just strange.  I'm used to seeing you with the tough look, the leathers and stuff. 
[02:48:00]  Well, when he came down the ramp.  But I'm not going to sleep in leather, you know what I mean?  I know.  The guy comes down the ramp.  He's got the big pants.  He's got the leather jacket.  He looked like some kind of a transformer.  Remember the Transformers?  Swear to God.  I thought I could bend you, twist you, and you'd be like a space car.  What do you mean a transformer?  What's that?  You ever see that?  The robot things, and you bend them, and all of a sudden it's a space vehicle?  Yeah, and what happens?  Well, the big pants could be like the rocket engines.  And then the studded jacket could be the middle of the ship.  And your head could be like the lunar module. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know.  It's just, I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want to see you without your superhero clothes on.  Did you enjoy the presentation?  Oh, wonderful, Dice.  You know what I mean?  That was a pretty wild show.  It was a great show.  I did anything but bounce my nuggets off that chick in the front row.  I thought you were going to do that.  And then you're giving out dirty panties.  I mean, you're right.  Isn't that amazing how I had them?  What thing?  Yeah, I was a surprise.  You always got to carry some dirty panties around.  All right.  Right.  And I don't want to talk about, so what, I was listening to some guy that's like doing his daughter. 
[02:49:00]  No.  Abigail's in the studio.  She's 17 years old and I guess very open and free.  And then the father's pretty cool about the whole damn thing.  Abigail.  Abigail.  Girl.  Abigail.  Abigail.  Abigail.  Hi.  Why would you go on radio?  See, this is what aggravates me.  It only aggravates me because, see, I know what slobs they are.  And I talk about it when I perform, right?  Abigail's only 17, Dice.  No, that's not the point. 
[02:49:30]  All right, go ahead.  They turn slob when they're 14.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God.  That's normally the turning point.  Right.  Because if they're 14, they're going with a 17, 18-year-old guy.  Yeah.  You know, to teach them what to do with the nugget bag.  Right?  Okay.  So, my whole point is, why would she even go on the air and discuss these things with her father?  Because that's how they are.  You know, you got a boyfriend right now?  No, I don't. 
[02:50:00]  So, what are you doing in the living room by yourself, then?  What, do you just sit there and tease your father?  No, she's got friends.  Yeah, but she teases him.  Well, I agree with you there.  I mean, I only caught the tail end of the conversation.  You know, Abigail's, you know, flower patch.  All right, Dice, I got to go with you.  You know what I mean?  When you make a point, which is rare, you make a good point. 
[02:50:30]  Well, you always got to do the dumb thing.  Well, Dice, you're dumb.  No, I'm just not, I'm not, I'm not, you know, acclimated to like school.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  I'm not dumb.  That's what I hear you.  I'm not dumb.  Okay, I'm sorry.  You know, I yelled at you about that the other night.  You got off on the wrong foot.  Sure, I made beautiful points when I did that performance.  Of course you did. 
[02:51:00]  But the point is, why would a girl, you know, just sit there with her legs open, with a bunch  of vibraphones between her legs?  You know what I mean?  She hasn't done anything.  She's just kind of hanging.  Yeah, she's hanging, because it's illegal if she does things, Dice.  It's illegal if she does things with something illegal.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Nice for the defense.  No, what I'm, no.  I'm trying, it's illegal if she does something with the father.  It's illegal if she does something with anybody right here.  So she's been just sitting here very nice. 
[02:51:30]  Nicy-nice.  When did you start pulling the mud out?  What?  You know, you were a kid once.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you found your package, and you experimented.  Yeah.  How old were you?  Who, me?  Yeah.  It's none of your business, Dice.  I want to know.  I was young, though.  Really young.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I was like 13, I think.  What do you mean you were like?  I was 13.  You were either 12 or 14 or 13. 
[02:52:00]  It was about 13 or 14.  I remember.  What happened?  How did it all happen?  It's a really good story.  I told the story already.  Actually, your father was pretty cool, too.  I was a friend of the family.  I got hooked up.  The dad hooked up.  He was like 19.  The dad hooked up Anthony.  You mean you never practiced with yourself first before you went into the field with it?  Five times a day, every day, since I was about, I think, 11.  Really?  Sure.  And then Pop set up his first banging.  Right.  Your father set up your first banging?  Yeah, I think he didn't like me in the bathroom the whole time, because I was always in the bathroom. 
[02:52:30]  A lot of bathroom time.  It was like a monkey.  Isn't it amazing?  I was falling in love with the bathroom at about 12 years old.  Like a chimp.  It's like whatever you had to do.  Like if you said, Ma, I've got to do the homework now.  I'll be in the bathroom.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Ma, I've got to study for an important test in school, Ma.  I'll be in the bathroom.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Dice.  What?  What is it?  Bosco or what?  You bet or Bosco. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, you bet or Bosco.  Which way?  You bet.  You bet.  You bet.  Yeah.  Then we dance.  Does Abigail know that?  I don't know.  Ask him.  Abigail.  Yeah.  All right.  Which way now?  You bet or Bosco.  What?  I have no idea what he's talking about.  Abigail, which way?  You bet or Bosco.  Yeah, pick one.  Which way?  Which way?  You bet or Bosco.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  You don't need to know.  Which way?  Pick one.  I'm afraid to pick one. 
[02:53:30]  Just pick one.  All of the above?  No.  What do you mean all of the above?  What are you?  Abigail.  A 17-year-old girl.  You're like in junior high already.  You should know that.  What grade are you in?  Like the 8th?  I'm a junior in high school.  You're in high school?  11th grade.  11th grade.  So you're like in the middle?  The middle of high school.  Yes, Dice.  The middle.  How many more years do you have? 
[02:54:00]  One.  One year.  And then you're going to go to college?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And then what?  And then I'm going to graduate.  So what are you going to study in college?  Are you just going to be the smartest girl on all fours?  Wow.  That's what happens with a lot of these girls in school.  You know what I mean?  They all of a sudden, they develop a body.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  They wiggle around in front of the teacher.  Smartest girl without any books.  Dice, you better boss go. 
[02:54:30]  Which way?  You bet.  Too bad.  You bet.  And then everybody done.  That's right.  Dice, we got to let you go, man.  That's okay.  I just called, you know, I wanted to thank you guys for being down there.  Thank you, Dice.  That was a good time.  I want to thank all the fans that came down there.  I think everybody had a good time with everybody that said, you know, like that.  I think so.  We had a party.  You know what I mean?  We had a party.  You know, I just got this little beef with Anthony about the other thing.  But, you know, it's great.  All right.  We'll talk another day.  Yeah.  What is this blow-off all of a sudden?  No, we got to.  You got Abigail up there. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Everything to everybody.  You bet.  You bet.  You bet.  And then everybody done.  And then they said like this.  I got one for you, Dice.  Yeah, go ahead.  Abigail or Dice?  What?  Abigail or Dice.  Which way?  Abigail.  I don't get it.  Abigail or Dice.  Which way?  I don't get it.  Abigail or Dice.  Which way?  You, you.  Yeah.  Give us one.  Pick one. 
[02:55:30]  Pick one.  Abigail or Dice?  Abigail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye, Dice.  And then we dance.  All right.  Let's check in with Earl.  Earl, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?

I also learned that someone took up the screen name You Got a Problem Sister on Opie.
