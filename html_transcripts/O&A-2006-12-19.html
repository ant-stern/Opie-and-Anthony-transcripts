<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, featuring Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and in-studio DJ Drew Boogie, opened with their usual vulgar banter, immediately diving into the fallout from their controversial "homeless shopping spree" in Boston.  Mayor Menino's vehement condemnation, fueled by an eight-year-old grudge stemming from a prank announcing his death, was a major focus.  They countered his criticisms by highlighting the positive emotional impact on both the homeless participants and the generous listeners who contributed.  They also criticized the negative press coverage from the Boston Herald and Boston Globe, accusing the reporters of shoddy research and a biased portrayal.  The unexpectedly widespread positive listener response was contrasted with the negative reaction of Mayor Menino, whose poor public speaking skills were mocked with played audio clips.  A caller, Sonny Farrelli, called the mayor a "prick."  The show further discussed the Drudge Report and Fox News's misidentification of radio personality Fez as homeless in a video from the shopping spree.

The controversy surrounding Miss USA, Tara Conner, became the second major topic.  The hosts reacted to reports of her underage drinking, drug use, and a kiss with Miss Teen USA, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of the media's reaction compared to similar celebrity scandals involving figures like Britney Spears.  They also offered crude commentary on Conner's appearance.  Audio clips from news reports were played throughout this segment.  Scheduled guests Bill Burr and Louis C.K. were mentioned, along with the poorly received new song "Shelter Me" by Grey Wolf.

The show continued with more offensive jokes, this time focusing on a man who murdered his grandmother and a high school student who tampered with salad dressing.  The hosts and guests—including Drew Boogie, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K.—engaged in extensive, vulgar commentary on both stories. Pamela, a MacBook karaoke contest winner, then performed "I Saw the Sign" live, twice (once with and once without musical accompaniment), prompting further crude and sexually suggestive remarks.  Discussions about a high school wrestler accused of rape, focusing on a wrestling move called a "butt drag," followed, alongside anecdotes about humiliating high school sports initiation rites, often involving sexual themes.  Mentions of Rosen's Restaurant and Catering, and F.H. Riley's restaurant were included, along with their upcoming appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

The next segment began with wrestling-themed, sexually charged commentary, transitioning to a caller, then Pamela’s raucous, sexually suggestive a cappella rendition of Alanis Morissette’s "You Oughta Know." A caller, Chris from Mafia Life, recounted a negative experience at a Ron and Fez Christmas party, alleging that security guard Poe inappropriately touched a woman.  This led to a lengthy, increasingly absurd and sexually explicit discussion with Poe, who offered various justifications.  Other callers weighed in, with some defending Poe and others criticizing Chris.  Guest Joel McHale promoted his work and engaged in banter, frequently focusing on Britney Spears and other salacious celebrity gossip.  McHale shared a story about abruptly ending interviews.  Further calls detailed other incidents from the Ron and Fez party, including oral sex in a bunny suit.  A story about a pedophile sting operation and the emotional state of those caught was also discussed.  The segment ended with final calls, including Big Kev giving gifts.

The show concluded with Big Kev presenting Opie and Anthony with Christmas gifts (a 3D Jaws poster, a Kurt Cobain action figure, and a Black Sabbath t-shirt), accompanied by crude jokes. A "Line of the Day" segment featuring a graphic description of female genitalia attributed to Louis C.K. followed.  CokeLogic was announced as the winner of a $1,000 HopMovies.com video contest, with the winning entry featuring "Uncle Paul." Other finalists' entries, described as disturbing and sexually explicit, were mentioned.  Finally, the hosts promoted upcoming appearances by Bill Burr, Louis C.K., and Jim Norton, along with Norton's DVD release, before a rushed sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  What's with this stuff?  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Fire.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage, and then eventually everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs,  what a bore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  O.P.  O.P.  Do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. 
[00:01:00]  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Fiddle with that, E-Rock.  Fiddle.  A lot of fiddling going on once again this morning.  Fiddle with it.  Fiddle.  Just fiddle with it a bit, boy.  Fiddle away.  Fiddle away.  Camera.  I think in the new year, we move back to XM. 
[00:02:00]  I mean, this is all nice.  We're not leaving regular radio, but I think we leave this studio until they can figure it out.  Anytime we're out of here, for any day, we're not supposed to be out of here.  And sometimes, even if we're in here for a week, something is screwed.  Something is screwed up almost every morning.  This has nothing to do with Tim, by the way, because he's running around like crazy once again with his shoes untied.  He's going to trip and hurt himself.  Let's hope. 
[00:02:30]  Everyone's like, Tim, your shoes are untied.  He goes, I know.  They've been untied since Thursday.  I'm like, all right.  Carry on.  I'd love to see a portly gentleman take a tumble.  But every morning, something wrong with this studio.  Look, man, we're doing you a favor by broadcasting over here, then walking to XM and continuing our broadcast.  So the least they can do around here is make sure everything is set and ready to go every single morning.  That's all we ask.  This works.  Our pal talk cameras work every single time at XM. 
[00:03:00]  I think it's sabotage-y.  So in the new year, they've got to figure that out.  Or guess what?  We'll just do the whole show from XM.  Yeah.  Because we can get stuff working.  Well, there's never a problem over there.  Never a problem over there when it comes to our equipment.  Oh, the equipment.  Yeah, right.  Well, they have other problems, but...  Other financial variety.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  And I want to start by saying Mayor Menino is a dick.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I've been waiting three days to say that.  You couldn't bully us around this time, Mr. Menino, could you?  No, he couldn't.  Let me check this brand new text that just came in from Master Poe.  Yeah.  Ah, I guess he's upstairs. 
[00:04:00]  I think the he he's referring to is me.  Yeah.  But it's sent to my phone.  Mm-hmm.  And the show's on.  You should text back, I think he's an ass.  We all know who you mean.  He's not a smart one.  We all know that.  Oh, my God.  But he could kick ass.  Maybe he could send yours for free.  So he figured he'd...  Perhaps, sir.  Free text, gentlemen.  All right.  Where do we begin?  First of all, good morning to Boston, especially today.  Good morning to everyone listening to us on WBCN. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, BCN, huh?  Make sure you support WBCN and make sure you support all the radio stations we're heard on in your city.  Because some of these guys work their asses off behind the scenes.  Yeah.  WBCN was bullied for about a week at this point.  For about a week.  And they didn't fold.  They did the right thing.  They broadcasted our homeless shopping spree on Saturday when we did it live.  And they did the rebroadcast yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  And Mayor Menino is not happy about that.  And the problem is he's holding a grudge.  He's holding an eight-year grudge.  Give it up already, could you?  Here's the facts.  We did a homeless shopping spree.  You know the deal by now.  We get a bunch of homeless people.  A lot of these guys we talked to throughout the entire year.  And we treat them like rock stars for a day.  Like smelly rock stars.  But rock stars nonetheless.  Yeah.  It was a bit that we started, I don't know, five or six years ago. 
[00:05:30]  This is the fourth annual homeless shopping spree that just passed on this past Saturday.  And at first, Ant and I were talking about this last night.  At first, yeah, you're right.  It was one of these goofy things.  Like how funny would it be to just bring a bunch of smelly bums to a mall and have them shop for an afternoon.  And to get our listeners there to watch the whole thing.  Yes, of course.  That's how it started.  Because that's shocking.  That's right.  And we're shocked.  But the stupid bit has taken on a life of its own. 
[00:06:00]  Where tears are being shed.  The bit mutated.  Ugh.  The bit mutated, all right.  It started as a nice, horrible thing that we were doing to the underprivileged.  Where it was all about just pointing and laughing.  Like, look what we're doing.  Point, laugh, and cart the homeless around to nice neighborhoods so they can also point and laugh.  That's right.  But now, it's the fourth annual homeless shopping spree. 
[00:06:30]  And there are people crying.  The bus arrives.  There's well over 2,000 people.  And these guys are getting off the bus like they're rock stars.  I mean, look at the videos on YouTube.  The camera's just going off like crazy.  Every time one of these guys was announced to the crowd.  It might as well be.  I know Ronnie and Fezzy touched on it yesterday.  It might as well have been like the World Series team pulls up in the bus after winning the World Series.  Right.  And there's the people outside.  And they're screaming for them. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  As they're getting off the bus.  That was it.  That was it.  That's right.  Same scene.  And then these thousands of people followed the homeless around the mall at Short Hills.  By the way, we beat them up pretty good on Saturday.  A big thank you to the mall at Short Hills.  They were great to our staff.  They were great to the homeless.  They did the right thing.  And they allowed this to happen.  And it went off without a hitch.  And I want to thank the security, especially at the mall at Short Hills.  Unbelievable.  So then the rock stars slash homeless guys walked around the mall for two hours. 
[00:07:30]  And they bought stuff they desperately needed.  And then back on the bus, back to New York City, and then back to the cold, hard streets of New York.  Back to the streets.  You had your day.  But now we raise awareness for the homeless and their plight.  It's a whole thing now.  Even though back in the day it started off as just a goofy thing that we decided to do.  And I was answering emails and message board posts.  Right.  Even the crowd thanked the homeless at the end. 
[00:08:00]  They did a chant.  Thank the homeless.  Oh, no.  Thank you, homeless.  Right?  Thank you, homeless.  It was unbelievable, right?  Go ahead, Kenny.  I don't know if you guys know this.  When we got through the tunnel, we dropped the bums off at Port Authority, the bus terminal.  The bums.  And they got out with their shopping bags and all their goodies and everything.  Somebody might have called the police and said, like, there's a bunch of bums that might have robbed something.  They should have got all frisked shopping bags.  So they all got rolled and frisked and put up against the wall and had their chops busted over the whole thing. 
[00:08:30]  And Kenny couldn't wait to tell everybody that.  After we just made everyone feel so warm about what we did.  Because he's probably the one that called the police.  Yeah, no kidding.  Not only did he.  Getting in on it, throwing a few bashes yourself.  He called the police and then he did the frisking as well.  Yeah.  Thank you, Kenny, for completely destroying everything I just said for the last ten minutes.  It's a beautiful moment.  Yeah, we're trying to tell the people how beautiful this whole afternoon was for the homeless and our fans. 
[00:09:00]  And you just squashed the whole damn thing.  Anyway, so that's the back story, okay?  We broadcast to, I don't even know, I think 25 cities.  Yeah.  I think.  And it's going to get even larger in the new year.  We just made another deal or two.  We're going to be on in a couple more cities in the new year to be announced, right?  Isn't that nice?  And then we're all over the country thanks to XM.  And we're all over Canada thanks to XM.  One lousy city had a problem with our homeless shopping spree. 
[00:09:30]  One lousy city.  A big problem.  A huge problem.  Gee.  It was Boston because the mayor is holding a grudge for something we did eight years ago.  Mayor Menino.  We paid for being stupid eight years ago.  Trust me.  We were on top of the radio world in Boston.  We did something stupid, something outrageous.  We told the whole city that the mayor of Boston, Mayor Menino, died in a car crash while he was on vacation for April Fool's Day. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, we did that.  We may have said he was dead.  And we lost our jobs.  We paid for that little mishap, okay?  We attempted to apologize to the mayor.  He didn't want to have any of that crap.  And eight years later, he's still holding a grudge.  Eight years later.  He's the only city, the only mayor that had a problem with our homeless shopping spree.  The only one.  And he had a problem through what he read.  Obviously, he didn't hear it.  He had heard about it, didn't hear the show, and immediately thought we were doing this exploitive, real problematic thing with the homeless where we were setting them loose. 
[00:10:30]  That's what the headline was.  Right.  We set the homeless loose in a very high-end mall.  Well, it's an interesting story.  How it happened?  Yeah, so we'll back up.  It was about a week ago.  We started getting word from WBCN that some guy, I don't even know his name anymore, to be completely honest with you.  But he started the whole thing. 
[00:11:00]  He was outraged that we were going to do this little stunt with the bums and the homeless shopping.  So he started like an email campaign, and BCN was getting just bombarded by emails from all these people that aren't even listeners.  It was like they were mass emailing.  They were trying to get a boycott going.  They were trying to shut down WBCN, and they got Mayor Menino's attention.  And then I guess Mayor Menino needs attention himself or something.  I don't know.  But he jumped on this one big time.  And I got a story here. 
[00:11:30]  This goes back about four days now, five days.  The headline, Menino outraged with WBCN for homeless broadcast.  As I read this, I want to say once again, we're all over the country with this radio show.  The only city that had a problem with the homeless shopping spree, because it's personal.  It has nothing to do with the homeless shopping spree itself, okay?  According to a statement from the mayor's office Saturday, Mayor Thomas Menino is outraged at the WBCN radio show set to air live Saturday with the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:12:00]  This event airing on the Opie and Anthony show takes a number of homeless people from New York City to a shopping mall where they are humiliated and degraded as they are given money and alcohol.  Oh, they were? Humiliated and degraded?  Is that what happened?  It's not the show I heard.  Well, he didn't do his research.  Of course not.  I mean, there's videos from past homeless shopping sprees all over the Internet.  You might think he might want to do his research before he jumps on this one. 
[00:12:30]  And then it continues.  This is a quote from the mayor.  This so-called shopping spree is a sick and twisted exercise that degrades the most vulnerable members of our society.  This is an outrage.  This is wrong.  And we need the public and our partners who care about the homeless and about basic human decency to stand up and tell them so, Mayor Menino said in a statement.  How did they understand him?  Yeah, exactly.  Fat, retard tongue.  Well, this started the bullying.  The mayor tried to bully us once again, and he failed miserably, I'm proud to announce that. 
[00:13:00]  Sorry.  Didn't work.  If he's so concerned about the homeless, why doesn't he take some of the money he's wasting on that hole they're digging under Boston that's falling and killing people and put it into homeless houses?  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Can you do your research?  Oh, Jimmy.  They are helping the homeless, and that's why he was outraged.  Yeah, we're getting into that.  With this whole thing.  What a bum.  Now, yeah, read on, Opie, and you will see what the mayor is doing to help the homeless.  And it blows away what we did. 
[00:13:30]  By the way, I'm completely amazed that our staff decided not to highlight that part of the story, because that's the whole story.  It's huge.  That makes it really, really funny.  The homeless people who will be used for this event are human beings who may have been struggling for years with the adversity and problems that come with alcoholism and addictions, or with mental illness and other disabilities.  The fact that WBCN has chosen the homeless in the holidays to present this humiliating and shameful attempt at humor is inhumane and shameful, Mayor Menino added in the statement. 
[00:14:00]  The shameful thing is shameful?  Is that what he said?  I don't know.  That buffoon.  And then this article finally ends with, the show is set to air Saturday afternoon, and again on Monday morning, the same day, listen to this.  Same day.  What?  It must be a holy day.  It must be some day where Boston really helps out their homeless, right?  The same day that city officials will be going out to count the homeless population in Boston. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Close to 300 volunteers will join Mayor Menino in counting every homeless person living without shelter on the streets of Boston.  The goal of the census is to count the men, women, and children living on the street in shelters and in treatment and transitional programs so that the city can put a number to those in need.  A number.  Give them a number.  That's better than giving them food and clothes and a bus ride to a nice mall to the adulation of thousands of people and money to shop on Christmas like real people. 
[00:15:00]  That's better.  Just count them.  Do they use paint guns to make sure they don't paint or count the same guys twice?  Yeah.  Just walk around, thud, thud, thud.  Thud, thud, thud, thud.  Oh, I see.  We've gotten you already.  Hey, the Boston Herald is listening today.  Hey, the Boston Globe is listening today.  Here's my quote.  Mayor Menino is a dick.  Get that in print.  Do you think they'll be able to quote that?  Get that in print. 
[00:15:30]  I hope so.  The only one that had a problem with the homeless shopping spree.  I want to say that over and over and over again.  So the PD at WBCN, the whole staff at WBCN were just getting major pressure not to air the homeless shopping spree on Saturday and the rebroadcast on Monday.  Oh, they did it.  And they did it.  Good.  They did it.  And we've been saying for weeks that we need someone out there to stand up to these asses and don't fold.  And guess what?  It finally happened.  WBCN did not fold. 
[00:16:00]  And they aired the homeless shopping spree.  And guess what?  Nothing happened.  Just leave it alone.  Do some research and realize that for a day, all right, for a day, we took about a dozen homeless guys out, gave them food, warmth, and thousands of people.  Yeah.  That were there cheering them on like rock stars, giving them money.  They had gift cards that we had supplied them. 
[00:16:30]  But for the most part, it was the fans that stepped up.  And, you know, when they walked into a shoe store and wanted a $240 pair of boots, they didn't use the gift card.  One of our fans came over and said, look, I'll pick up that tab.  Yeah.  So the fans alone spent thousands of dollars on these guys.  And where's the harm in that?  Where's the awful exploitation?  Some people say that when they came in, we were making jokes.  When anyone comes in, we make jokes. 
[00:17:00]  When our best friends come in here, we joke about them.  Our comedian friends come in.  They get goofed on.  When the homeless come in, we know some of these guys for years now.  We're not going to goof on them.  We're not going to goof.  The fact is, yeah, you smell.  So that's going to be the first thing we goof on.  You're homeless.  You can't shower.  Of course you're going to smell.  We're not going to comment on it.  We're going to sit there all PC and make like it's not happening.  No. 
[00:17:30]  You tell them, Jesus Christ, you stink.  Go out and get some clothes.  And then they go out.  They get some clothes.  They get some warmth, some food.  And they have one of the best days probably they do the whole year.  And the passion from the listeners, the excitement from the listeners, the giving from the listeners.  Look, this wasn't our goal when we came up with the homeless shopping spree.  We're not sitting here this morning acting like good guys.  Trust me.  But this event has taken on a life of its own.  This stupid event of ours. 
[00:18:00]  Do good or Dan's.  I know.  And in the end, it certainly raises awareness for the homeless.  We didn't set out to do this.  Trust me.  We did not.  I'm not going to go on the radio today and act like a good guy.  You know, in the beginning, yes.  It was about getting smelly, smelly, awful bums to go to a mall during the height of the Christmas shopping season.  High class mall.  High class mall.  And just bother everybody involved.  Yes, absolutely.  But now that we're at the fourth one, it has become something a lot different. 
[00:18:30]  And the way they become, it helps raise awareness.  And again, that's not the original intention.  These guys come on all year and you goof on them and you get to know them.  And there's a face and a personality that goes with the word homeless.  Like the gray wolf.  Him and his dumb song.  You know what?  People love that song.  And they wonder what's going on with this guy.  How is he doing?  He's going to see his family.  It's like it becomes a soap opera.  And you actually start to care about these people.  They're not just a bunch of homeless people that, you know, that just have no face and  they just stink and they walk by you.  You walk by a homeless guy on the street and just see him there. 
[00:19:00]  You don't know him from a hole in the wall.  He's just a bum on the street annoying you for money.  And you give him a wide berth.  You walk past him.  That's it.  This, they have personalities.  They have names.  They have histories that we get into on the air.  And they're people, you know, genuine people.  And we find out about them that way and the listeners do.  And they give to these people because they learned about them and know what they're all about. 
[00:19:30]  And the fact that Menino up there in Boston, you jerk off Menino and some of these writers for some of these newspapers just don't get it, didn't hear it, don't understand what we were doing, think it's just us.  You know, hey, let's kick him in the head with a Doc Martin while he's down, you know.  That isn't what it's about. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  And with that said, because we've got to take a break, the Boston Herald, their coverage of the homeless shopping spree, this is priceless.  And Menino continues yelling and screaming, the only city that had a problem with the homeless shopping spree, the only city, Boston.  Since the mayor is holding a grudge for something we did eight years ago, we paid for that stupid stunt you asked.  We paid for it.  Enough.  We're on in 25-plus cities all over America on XM, all over Canada.  And you were the only one that had a problem with this. 
[00:20:30]  Someone on a message board brought up a great point that the politicians, always around the holidays, come out of the woodwork to stand on a soup kitchen line for the 10 minutes that the camera crew is there and spoon out gruel to the homeless like they're doing something.  And that's a moment that they are exploiting the homeless for their own benefit.  It makes them look like, look at what I'm doing.  I'm doing such a great thing. 
[00:21:00]  I'm helping out at a soup kitchen during the holidays.  Do you honestly think that politician is standing there for hours on end helping these people?  No.  The second those cameras are gone, they are gone out of there.  And that is more exploitive than what we did.  Do you think the guy ever goes in without cameras?  Do you think he ever just shows you without a camera?  Oh, without a camera?  Get out of here.  No.  And the fact of the matter is we exchanged what we did for the homeless for good radio. 
[00:21:30]  You know, we weren't going to do this on a day where we're off and just do it.  It makes good radio.  Yeah.  We had a motive behind the whole thing.  We still do.  I was affected, though.  I had to do the homeless shopping spree all weekend long.  I'm just dishing out money to the homeless because I live in Manhattan.  So now all of a sudden I was uber aware of the homeless because of what we did.  And I'm like, oh, God, I would look like such an ass and hypocrite.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Wherever I went all weekend long, I'm aware I was going out. 
[00:22:00]  I put my keep off the grass sign on my lawn.  Stay away.  All right.  Listen, owner has gone.  So we got the newspaper article how the Boston Herald reported our homeless shopping spree.  We have the email exchange from the reporter and Steve because we don't hide.  Oh, there's some funny stuff.  We don't hide.  We want the reporter on the air that wrote this ridiculous article.  We call the mayor's office.  We want the mayor on our show or a representative from the mayor's office to call our show.  Why don't they talk to us? 
[00:22:30]  We called the mayor's office the last two or three days, and no one will come on the air with us.  A lot of boy.  They have a lot of comments by themselves.  That's right.  That's right.  No one can discuss it, and also we made the Drudge Report, and that's funny.  Wait till we tell you what happened with that if you haven't heard yet.  I mean, the Uber fans, the ONA Pest, they all know, but there's a whole bunch of other people that aren't that Uber or whatever.  Classic.  Yeah, but there's some classic stuff with the Drudge Report. 
[00:23:00]  It's going to make you laugh pretty hard.  So we got lots to do today.  Drew Boogie in studio.  He's going to be playing us in and out of breaks today.  Check this out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh!  I mean, revision isn't a position for all to see.  We're gladdening for how it feels.  I've got to pull that breath on my name on it.  Ah!  With a name.  Ah!  There's a cause for all the fun to make you think.  This really got the vision on the steel.  I've got to pull that breath on my name on it. 
[00:23:30]  Ah!  With a name.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

[00:25:00]  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Paying close attention to Boston this morning. 
[00:25:30]  WBCN did the right thing.  They aired our homeless shopping spree, and we couldn't be happier.  They had a lot of pressure up there, but they, in the end, did the right thing  and made sure our fine listeners up there got to hear the homeless shopping spree.  So, you know, to the past especially, you might want to thank WBCN throughout the day,  maybe give the other shows a call, or write an email to the program director up there,  because there was a lot of pressure.  There was a lot of pressure up there not to air our homeless shopping spree. 
[00:26:00]  And once again...  That bullcrap pressure.  Yeah.  That means nothing.  Yeah.  And you know what?  A lot of times...  Oh, they buckle under.  They buckle, and they fold, and they get scared, and they run away, but, you know...  They get scared.  But they held strong, and they did it.  And look, nothing happened.  And the reality is, I've got to say this over and over again, we're on in 25 cities on regular radio,  give or take one or two.  We're on across the country, thanks to XM.  We're on across Canada, thanks to XM. 
[00:26:30]  One city, one mayor had a problem with the homeless shopping spree,  and that's because he's holding a grudge because of something we did back in 98.  Okay?  Years ago.  He's paying close attention to us, and he can't wait for us to get kicked off the radio in Boston again.  He can't wait for that.  You know, but we're much different people than we were back in 98.  It's going to be a little tougher this time around.  You can't just bully us, Mayor Menino.  By the way, he was counting the homeless, what, yesterday? 
[00:27:00]  That was his big thing.  He went around with a bunch of volunteers, and they actually counted the homeless.  So they had little clipboards and little accusing fingers.  Yeah.  One, two subhumans, three subhumans.  Just counting.  Probably had gloves on and stuff.  Sorry.  A little Hitler footage on Fox News.  He's the in-studio comedian today.  Let's go to Bill in Vermont.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, I just wondered, when he was doing his counting there, was he doing a tag and release? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, was it a tag and release program?  Yeah, you've got to dart him in the ass first, and then get a little tag on their ear, and let him go.  Yeah, you know, I was listening, and I was like, oh, it's got to be what he was doing.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, so the Boston Herald, after the homeless shopping spree aired on Saturday when we did it live, and then the rebroadcast yesterday, Boston Herald, big headline, no holiday humor, and radio pairs jollies over degrading homeless. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  And this was Michelle McPhee that just heard it from the ONA pest.  Oh, did she hear it from the ONA pest?  You know, I'm a little embarrassed.  Know what they wrote?  Some of the stuff they wrote was just beyond brutal that we can't even read on the air.  Ruthless.  You know, we also, I've got to be honest, we like the ONA pests that have a little intelligence to them as well.  That helps our cause, you know, instead of just the C word over and over again.  But, you know, that stray bullet that just whacks an innocent bystander in the head is kind of fun, too. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  People that are focused and nice, that's all well and fine, but a few C words thrown in there can't hurt.  And she's obviously a very good writer because she wrote radio pairs jollies, which is always the sign of a good journalist.  Jollies.  Well, here we go.  Some people may have giggled at the idea of a gaggle of homeless men taking over the upscale Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  A stunt staged by radio shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, Opie and Anthony, and heard by WBCN listeners all weekend. 
[00:29:00]  It was tantamount to bringing a bus filled with the draggled from Boston Comet to sit on Santa's lap at the Chestnut Hill Mall.  She's localizing here and saying it's just like doing this.  Yes, I understand.  But Mayor Thomas Menino was not amused in the slightest.  This so-called shopping spree is a sick and twisted exercise that degrades the most vulnerable members of our society.  This is an outrage.  This is wrong. 
[00:29:30]  And we need the public and our partners who care about the homeless and about basic human decency to stand up and tell them so, Menino said, adding that the broadcast came on the same day that the city began counting the hubs homeless.  Oh, what an outrage.  Incidentally, it's not a so-called shopping spree.  It was a shopping spree.  It was a shopping spree, you add.  It wasn't up to debate.  That's so-called.  Yes.  That so-called mall.  I hate how you do that so-called breathing every morning.  Well, it's another reporter that doesn't want to just do the basics before she writes her story. 
[00:30:00]  You know, she hears something and then she just writes about it instead of maybe doing her own research.  God forbid you do a little research before you write a huge story for the Boston Herald.  She's not a particularly attractive gal.  I wonder if any of the listeners mentioned that in their emails.  No.  It was brutal.  They would not our listeners.  No.  The mullets, they probably kept that under their hats.  It was nice, guys.  I got like, look at this.  These are all.  Oh, those are all the wonderful.  Yeah, it's great.  All right.  Moving on here.  Same day.  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  The homeless people will be used for this event.  The homeless people who will be used for this event are human beings who may have been struggling for years with the adversity and problems that come with alcoholism and addictions.  Booty hooty ho.  Or with mental illness and other disabilities.  So that's the quote from the other day as well.  The fact that WBCN has chosen the homeless and the holidays to present this humiliating and shameful attempt at humor is inhumane and shameful.  Of course, Menino has his own problems with the shock jocks.  And this is what it's all about, by the way.  Because, once again, I have to say it, the only city, the only mayor that had a problem with our homeless shopping spree. 
[00:31:00]  Menino, Boston.  The pair was already infamous for inhumane behavior, such as airing a couple having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, enraging Catholics nationwide.  But no prank is worse than the one they pulled on April Fool's Day in 1998.  So we go on the public airwaves and maybe say he's dead. 
[00:31:30]  The one that got the duo fired by WAF.  They went on the air and told listeners that Menino had been killed in a car crash, terrifying his wife, children, grandchildren, and loved ones.  Which, by the way, is not really true.  No.  Because no one took us seriously that day.  Of course not.  It's April Fool's.  Whatever.  I mean, we paid for it.  And, I mean, you know, to defend it at this point is ridiculous.  We understand that.  But we paid for our stupidity.  Trust me, we did.  I'm laughing, really.  Oh, I know. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, I know.  Call me humorless, but who could find that funny?  Apparently a lot of people, because the two knuckleheads, moved to New York and their show became syndicated.  That's right, because we do a very good radio show in the end, you ass.  It's not all about doing a stunt here and there.  Shock.  We've got to entertain the people Monday through Friday, four to five hours a day.  That's why we're syndicated, because we do a good job doing that, Michelle.  And if you did some research, you would understand that.  In this weekend's highly publicized trip, homeless and lunatics were brought to the fancy mall in New Jersey and treated to Christmas presents, makeovers, and booze. 
[00:32:30]  And there were girls.  I'm certain they were.  And there were girls.  Buxotic girls.  I don't get this.  And there were girls.  I'm certain they were decked out in $200 juicy sweatpants and armed with their daddy's Amex cards, who called the show to complain that Opie and Anthony were ruining their shopping experiences.  They were called overprivileged whores on the air.  Quotes.  I like that.  I couldn't be happier. 
[00:33:00]  And by the way, they wrote, they are called overprivileged, and they put quotes around whores.  Whores.  What is their, what's up for interpretation there?  Right.  You get it?  They were overprivileged whores.  Overprivileged was said also.  Yeah.  You could put that in the quotes.  Whores was not implied.  Yeah.  And all this Christmas cheer comes just days before National Homeless Persons Memorial Day, whatever the hell that is.  What is that?  Some dumb holiday that makes him, makes him feel good about himself, that he goes out there and actually counts the homeless.  What do you do after you count them is what I want to know. 
[00:33:30]  What is it, Homeless Memorial Day?  They're calling it National Homeless Persons Memorial Day.  Everybody thinks that a homeless, but when he counts them, he actually counts them like count, count.  A lot of people don't know that, but he's a little humor.  Count, count.  And with that big tongue of his, he's got to keep starting over.  Okay, maybe creating a Memorial Day to the country's homeless population is a bit too crunchy granola,  but I'm also opposed to using down-on-their-luck folks who can be mentally ill or desperate alcoholics for financial gain. 
[00:34:00]  Remember, and this is what is just completely ridiculous about this Boston Herald article that came out Monday.  Remember bumfights, those atrocious videos that show teenage punks beating up homeless people and then urinating on them?  Those uplifting clips provoked the beatings of at least a half dozen homeless people across the country.  All right, so following your logic, Michelle, our videos, which are now all over YouTube and all over opianthony.com,  that may provoke some people to actually be aware that there's a homeless problem in this country, you ass. 
[00:34:30]  And buy stuff for them.  And buy stuff for them.  Oh, wouldn't that be awful?  Yeah.  What a dope.  Wouldn't that be horrid?  What a dope.  You went to journalism school?  Well.  What a dope.  You're a dope.  What a dope.  What a dope.  There's young writers out there wishing they could write for the Boston Herald, and you're taking up space.  How do you like that, Michelle, you dope? 
[00:35:00]  Opie.  Opie, I'm not a journalist, and I could figure out that in two seconds.  Opie, be a little nice.  She is a broad.  You are a dopey broad.  And a homely one to boot.  Not a looker, Michelle.  You're like, see, you use this dumb bumfights example, so using your own example that's in your article,  that would mean that actually people out there would do something positive for the homeless.  Yeah.  If you did your research on the homeless shopping spree to begin with, which you didn't. 
[00:35:30]  Which makes her?  Ah, dopey broad.  At least the homeless brought to the Short Hills Mall, got a few beers, pictures with Santa,  and maybe even some Gap sweatshirts rather than a beating.  Actually, they didn't get the Gap sweatshirts, Michelle.  No, the Gap.  Because if you listened to the show, the Gap was the only store that refused the homeless, by the way.  The Gap was abominable.  So you didn't even hear the stupid show before you wrote your stupid article, you dope.  That was the dumbest example to use because the Gap was the only store that refused us. 
[00:36:00]  And she's ugly.  Again, because she just didn't listen and understand the whole bit.  And you have to write for a newspaper because you're a homely.  I wouldn't care.  That's why she'll never do TV nose because she's not a looker.  She's a homely girl.  She'll never do TV nose?  Did I say that?  Oh, of course you did.  I haven't slept since yesterday.  I can't wait to hear it on the replay.  But I'll be sleeping.  I'm exhausted. 
[00:36:30]  I've been up a long time.  TV nose.  It's all Danny's fault, too, for me.  By the way, and then they were dropped off back in the streets.  They were rousted from in the name of fun.  Yeah.  We're going to drop off at the Ritz.  They're homeless.  They're homeless.  How about we come over your house, you ass.  That's right.  And we just leave them at your house.  What would you do?  Cook them some breakfast?  That's right.  Invite them into your guest room or maybe to sleep with your daughter. 
[00:37:00]  But don't touch her.  You know, in the homeless community, the homeless shopping spree is the talk on the streets every year.  They can't wait for it.  What's the word on the street?  A homeless shopping spree.  A homeless shopping spree.  She probably wouldn't even invite them in.  She'd probably just look down her news at them.  By the way, she'll never do TV nose.  That's for sure.  Oh, I should be shot.  I'm a dope.  You rule.  All right, here we go.  So Michelle wrote this dopey article.  Read the right strip on your television. 
[00:37:30]  It's a TV nose.  People on the nose are so stuffy.  You want me to have those ribs, you?  Fox News cable.  All right, now we're getting some national attention.  Oh, is she not pretty?  Nice.  This just came in from Fox News.  Her looks bother me.  Fox News.  Is it the Fox News channel?  Yeah.  The national one?  Great.  Not that local drivel.  Fox and Friends.  Fox and Fiends.  We don't even acknowledge local news coverage anymore. 
[00:38:00]  We only want national coverage.  Look how bitter we are towards everything.  Here, this just reported this morning.  And another radio show is stirring controversy again.  After taking a group of homeless people to an upscale New Jersey mall, radio shop jocks  Opie and Anthony staged the trip to the Short Hills Mall for their popular radio show.  But not everyone was amused.  Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was particularly critical of the duo, calling it sick and twisted. 
[00:38:30]  All right, there you go.  Sick and twisted.  There you go.  Well, I guess we're going to have to go on Fox News tonight.  Fox News.  Call up Hannity.  He wants us on a stupid show.  All right, so Michelle writes this article, right?  You know what this article is?  Huh?  It's dreck.  I was going to call it drivel.  It's absolute dreck.  It is dreck.  She was so lazy.  She didn't even listen to the show so then she could be informed about the damn thing. 
[00:39:00]  And she was too busily looking into the mirror and weeping.  That's right.  Because she's homely.  Well, we're getting national coverage this morning.  And what you just heard, once again, have to state it again, the only city and the only  mayor that had a problem with the homeless shopping spree was Boston and Mayor Menino  because he's holding a grudge because of something we did back in 1998.  Okay.  Douche.  So then Steve writes, does Michelle, what's her last name?  McPhee.  McPhee.  McPhee.  Wallflower reports no holiday humor in Radio Pairs Jollies over degrading homeless. 
[00:39:30]  What?  Wallflower.  What the hell's wallflower?  No one asked her to dance?  That's the olden term for when they sat against the wall because none of the guys would ask  them to dance or vote yo dodo.  She should be experiencing lesbian sex for the first time in a Laura Ingalls dress.  You homely dope.  Oh, by the way, when they use this little thing, it's complete BS. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you, A to the H from Columbus, Ohio.  Boston Globe.  This was in the Boston Globe, I guess.  Oh, do we have the Boston Globe articles, too?  It doesn't matter.  We're pretty much covering it.  Daily Planish.  No, get the Boston Globe because we want to see what dope wrote about it in the Boston  Globe and got things wrong.  Boston Globe.  This was in the article.  Attempts to reach the Opie and Anthony show and WBCN officials were unsuccessful yesterday.  Yeah, what?  Did anybody raise your hand if the Boston Globe attempted to get a quote from you?  I stayed by my phone all day staring at us. 
[00:40:30]  You called them, Jimmy?  And they wouldn't take my quotes.  I said, but I just want to say something.  I want to be on the nose.  Right.  By the way, and they didn't understand and hung up.  We're going to explain a lot of things today.  When they say stuff like that, that's them just being lazy and covering their asses.  No one tried to attend me or Anthony or little Jimmy Norton or anyone else that works for  this fine radio show.  No.  We'd have been happy to give a quote.  Of course we would.  Our quotes are memorable when we hit the papers. 
[00:41:00]  We were defending ourselves on message boards and other things where people had a little problem  because they just read the stories, didn't hear the actual piece.  So of course we would talk to these people on the news, but they never, ever want to really  talk.  Never.  Do you know how badly I wish I would have got that call?  Here's what the quote from this show would have been.  Oh.  Homeless people have smelly groins.  That would have been the quote from the show.  Do you think they would have quoted the whole thing or it would have said homeless people 
[00:41:30]  and then quote, have smelly groins?  Or homeless people have smelly and then quote, groins.  Groins, in quotes.  Or maybe an exclamation point.  Homeless people have smelly groins.  Is that the globe?  Jimmy, search out some of the fun stuff in this.  I mean, we did, if it's the same crap, punctuation stain.  All right.  So Steve writes Michelle, because we want to get her on our show today to set her straight.  We want to set this dopey broad straight.  So maybe the next time she writes an article for the Boston Herald, she could be more informed. 
[00:42:00]  Dear Miss McVee.  Wait, hold on.  The broadcast is punctual.  I got to a little bit.  Wait, is this the Boston Globe article?  All right.  The broadcast is punctuated with jokes about how the homeless people smelled, how much  they drank, and how irresponsible their shopping was, such as buying a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses  and a boombox.  The show gave the homeless people nicknames such as Gray Wolf, Papa Rock, and Half-A-Hulk Face in French.  We can only take credit for one.  And that's Patrice. 
[00:42:30]  Gray Wolf was his.  Gray Wolf has been his name for years.  They make their own names.  Papa Rock is Papa Rock out on the street because he has a guitar and he's like an older rock guy.  Right.  But Half-A-Hulk Face, okay.  That was Patrice O'Neil.  Yeah, well, the guy's face is melting off his body.  What can I tell you?  Half of him is turning into the Hulk.  Yeah.  Come on.  Enough.  Oh, is that great?  So Steve had a little back and forth with this broad.  Steve writes...  This dame.  Steve writes, I'm wondering if you would like to call into the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow morning to discuss our annual homeless shopping spree. 
[00:43:00]  I wish you'd do it in the Steve voice.  You have to do it in Steve voice.  Please try to just do it in the Steve voice.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  He's trying to be nice to her so that she would respond.  Where's the email?  Oh, you don't have it in front of you?  Oh, let me see.  Wait.  Does he have a copy?  Because I've got to follow along, too.  Thank you.  This is the story.  This is in Steve's email.  Do you want me to say?  Well, Iraq doesn't listen.  Here it is.  Someday he will.  Okay.  Here it is.  Since I cut... 
[00:43:30]  Steve Carlisi wrote,  Hi, Michelle.  I'm wondering if you would like to call the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow morning to discuss our annual homeless shopping spree.  Grr.  Which you wrote about in the Boston Herald this morning.  Grr.  Grr.  By the way, stupid, why do you mention the paper she wrote it in?  She knows who she was.  With your typewriter.  You wrote it on your keyboard at the Boston Herald after you got up and drove there.  You over-explaining idiot. 
[00:44:00]  Did you use Microsoft Word?  He's right by me.  If so, it means you have a computer.  Please go to foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  After you typed your article and hit send.  He's a fool.  We're working on getting someone from the mayor's office on the phone as well.  If you could give me a call back, that would be great.  My cell phone number is 917-3-1.  No, they wouldn't pay attention. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  Michelle's response is...  Steve Carlisi, program director.  Opie and Anthony show.  Cell 917.  No, no, no.  Oh, sorry.  Well, there's a five in there, too.  So it's 3-5.  Well, we'll...  Oh, is it?  We're out the morning.  Okay.  It whittled it down a little bit.  It's a couple of zeros.  The rest of the morning, we're just going to give random numbers in the middle of a rant.  Just follow along.  Keep writing numbers down.  You'll get all seven.  I'm Steve Carr, damn it.  That's how we used to do it back in the day when we wanted to give someone's... 
[00:45:00]  Oh, whatever.  Maybe we shouldn't say it.  Anyway, Michelle writes, I'll check and get back to you.  I'm getting onion dated with illiterate foul-mouthed emails from your fans.  I'm being onion dated.  That's the O&A pest, of course.  So then email two, Steve wrote...  You want to go through that again?  Trying to be polite just to get her on the phone.  Yeah.  Thank you, please.  Thank you, please.  But keep in mind that we didn't instigate any type of correspondence flood from them.  A correspondence flood.  I wish you'd be washed away by a correspondence flood. 
[00:45:30]  A correspondence flood.  A correspondence flood.  Oh, my goodness.  They often act on their own.  Still like children.  Yeah.  The guys would like to speak to you completely openly and would like to have a normal dialogue.  Oh, are you a adult?  And her response, I'm not sure if I want to spend my morning being attacked.  You didn't explain it well enough.  The guys would like to open their mouths and have sound come out.  Sound come out.  Using their tongues to enunciate the language we call English. 
[00:46:00]  Steve Carlisi, program director, 917.  Yeah, she said she doesn't want to get in touch with us.  And then she writes, I won't be able to come on the show tomorrow.  And for your information, here's an example of the brilliance I have been bombarded with by ONA listeners.  Considering that I didn't even slam the show, just spoke of Menino's response.  You guys clearly have some extremely insane fans.  Yes, we do. 
[00:46:30]  They're ONA Pess and they fight back.  She did editorialize on the show, though.  Absolutely.  She's lying.  And this guy wrote something kind of...  When we're done wrong, the Pess jumped to our defense.  Well, the guy actually wrote something very intelligent to begin with.  And then he just had it.  Is that the one that's highlighted?  Yeah, I got it.  But this fan...  Oh, wait.  Fan email, 11 fan emails.  So they're just different people.  Oh, okay.  This is a fan email, right? 
[00:47:00]  Okay.  All right, yes.  Lex wrote, so what?  These are people that ONA have a relationship throughout the year.  And for fun, ratings, and charity, they have the shopping spree.  For a night, a few lucky homeless get to have fun, be loved,  and hopefully they get some much-needed equipment to survive the winter and streets of New York.  Now, have you done so much for the homeless, regardless if you benefited from it or not?  His writing just stinks.  But he wrote this to Michelle, and he was really frustrated because the response he got to the email he sent to Michelle McPhee was, 
[00:47:30]  thank you for reading the Herald.  Yeah.  It was an automated response.  Automated response.  So then the guy just had it and wrote, hey, see...  Wait, no.  I think I can do this.  All right, go ahead.  Hey, whore, I don't read that rag.  Why have a contact if it just has some dumb automated response?  He just lost his mind because instead of writing him back, he gets, thank you for reading the Herald. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And that was the example she sent in from our listeners.  But, you know, the guy felt like he was pushed.  He was trying to, you know, state his opinion, and he gets an automated response back, so he lost his mind.  And then it just goes on.  Steve's apologizing.  Steve goes, I apologize for their crass behavior.  Oh, crass.  Crass.  I wish you'd reconsider.  Steve Carlisi, program director, 917.  Steve, you're all horses crass. 
[00:48:30]  They were very crass, and I didn't appreciate it.  I was thoroughly trying to just be polite to get her on the phone the whole time.  By the way, I apologize for their crass.  It was actually a song by Foundry.  It was the B-side of Pendulum.  It was, actually.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Drew Boogie in the studio.  The last thing we've got to do is just talk about the Drudge Report.  It's really funny.  And then we'll move on to some fine other things on the show today.  Bill Burr is going to join the festivities after the break. 
[00:49:00]  And he's from Boston.  But once again, what needs to be said today, to everybody listening to us on WBCN,  please support the station and the other radio shows.  They did the right thing, and they felt a lot of pressure in the last week.  They didn't buckle.  I love it.  So thank the other shows and maybe send an email off to somebody at WBCN.  Good eggs.  They did the right thing.  Support WBCN.  Okay?  All right.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  And by the way, Mantown, while we're doing all this crazy radio. 
[00:49:30]  Mantown.  Their morning show did a Santa Speedo run.  Wow.  That sounds homosexual.  No kidding.  They ran backwards in the plungers.  Wow, man.  You guys are taking on the radio world with that one.  Wow.  Yeah.  Santa Speedo run.  Faggots!  Drew Boogie, get us out of here for a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Baby, nothing's true. 
[00:50:00]  We be hosting your sex.  I may begin.  We're always up to the sex.  Everybody get a his one.  Everybody get a his one.  Everybody get a his one.  Everybody get a his one.  Baby, got shot of a ring.  Got shot of a ring.  Rocky.  Got shot of a ring.  Not shot of a ring.  Got shot of a ring. 
[00:50:30]  Got shot of a ring.  Yeah.  How getting your nails done could wind up doing a lot of damage.  How bad will the hurricanes feel? 
[00:51:00]  A popular medicine for children now linked to seven deaths.  A common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers.  And is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn?  Oh, stop it.  Are your local reporters trying to scare you to death?  The Opie and Anthony Show wants to hear scary news teases from your town.  Send your audio to danny at foundrymusic.com.  That's danny at foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:51:30]  Tell me what you're going to do now.  Oh, nice.  How cool is that?  We got Drew Boogie in studio today.  That's awesome.  That's a nice mix there, Drew. 
[00:52:00]  He's doing it live in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's spreading across America.  We also have omelets today.  We do.  God, times have changed.  Back in the day, we would have a bartender and a full bar.  And now we got omelets.  It's a little early.  Now we got guys making omelets.  It's a little early.  We got to thank Rosen's Restaurant and Catering, 23 East 51st Street, between 5th and Madison  for the fine food today.  Travis and Brian are in.  Are you right?  Travis and Brian?  There you go. 
[00:52:30]  They're the ones making the omelets for us.  Rosen's Restaurant and Catering, 23 East 51st Street.  Nice.  Bill Burr in studio today as well.  I'm a actress, too.  Very lovely.  Yeah, she's very, very cool.  Hey, we're just about ready to finish up with this homeless shopping spree and put it to  bed for a while.  Although, you know, it's got legs because now Fox News Channel is doing reports on it  every hour.  Yeah, they picked up on it.  And the video they're using segues perfectly what we wanted to talk about next. 
[00:53:00]  Here's the story again, in case you missed it.  And where's Sam?  Because he'll explain what video they're using.  It's hilarious.  This is the story.  And another radio show is stirring controversy again.  After taking a group of homeless people to an upscale New Jersey mall, radio shop jocks  Opie and Anthony staged the trip to the Short Hills Mall for their popular radio show.  But not everyone was amused.  Boston Mayor Thomas Menino was particularly critical of the duo, calling it sick and twisted.  You know what I love about that story? 
[00:53:30]  They have to say, again.  Again.  Again, like, oh, God.  Thank you.  Enough with these guys already.  Thank you.  So, Sam ran that in.  It aired like a half hour ago.  And what video are they using, Sam?  It's the same one that was on the Drudge Report, which has a special guest homeless guy,  Fez.  Yeah.  The modern Fez show is the center of it.  Over the weekend, Drudge picked it up.  Yeah.  And they put the links to the Herald and Globe stories. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And then there was another link that said video.  Yeah.  It said, like, Mayor outraged over homeless stunt.  The other one said something to the effect of homeless let loose.  Turn loose.  Like we turn loose like tigers.  Set loose on shopping spree.  Set loose on shopping spree.  Shock suburban crowds.  Yeah.  Then there was another little link for the video.  And by the way, it's still up there.  It's buzzreport.com.  It's on the right-hand side of the page because his page is just a mess.  There's so much crap on it.  It's in the last column on the right.  So I click on the video and I'm waiting to see some of our favorite homeless people shopping 
[00:54:30]  at the Short Hills Mall.  And what do I see?  90% of this video is focusing on Fez.  This poor homeless guy named Fez.  Fez looks homeless.  He put the wool cap on.  He wasn't shaved.  And he was wandering around like he was somewhat out of his mind.  And the video captured somebody spraying perfume at him and it hit him in the eye.  So the only thing you really hear him say is, 
[00:55:00]  Ow, my eye.  And he's wandering around with like one eye shot and he looks like a lunatic.  And he is what I'm at.  The best thing was watching that video that if anybody had a problem with it and wanted  to show the video, he was the face of the homeless that day.  Yeah.  Fez.  By the way, there's so many videos up on YouTube.  I think we're up to like 20 to 30 videos on YouTube.  You got the arrival of the bus where they're treated like rock stars and the camera's going 
[00:55:30]  off like crazy.  You got people from above filming as they're walking around the mall with just, I don't  know, a thousand or so people following this particular crowd.  Unbelievable video.  But they pick this one to throw on the Drudge Report.  Yeah.  And it showed Fez, like I said, and just kept showing him and showing.  And then they get off of him.  They show a couple of the other homeless guys and then go right back to Fez.  Because it's all about this poor, this poor, this is the face of the homeless.  Here it is.  Here's the person they've been exploiting. 
[00:56:00]  I'd like to get to know this person.  I want to sit.  I want to see what box he sleeps in at night.  And believe me, if it's Fez, it's none.  He's a radio guy that's going to be starting on free FM.  What?  What?  Did I just say that?  I think tonight.  I think Ron and Fez are on tonight.  What?  Can we dump out of that statement?  My God.  Why?  I don't know.  I think Ron and Fez start tonight on free FM. 
[00:56:30]  Do they?  I think so.  Who knows?  Anyway, so yeah.  When are they supposed to start?  I think tonight.  What time?  Six.  All right.  Here in New York?  At 5.59, the deal will fall through.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's how it worked with us.  Yeah, we know that.  Christ on a pony.  So this is just another example of the media just not doing their homework whatsoever,  including now Fox News Channel, because they just did the story about us, and in the  background was the Fezzy video.  And all Fox News had to do was, like, I don't know, go to a message board, an Opie and Anthony 
[00:57:00]  message board, or listen to XM yesterday, and they would have found out that this video  is all about Fez from the Ron and Fez show, and he's not homeless.  No.  But they didn't do their just basic research, and they're running with this now on Fox News  Channel showing the video of Fez as one of the homeless guys.  Fez has millions in his mattress.  He doesn't trust banks.  Huh?  When college kids do, like, term papers, you know?  Yeah.  You'd always have the BS footnotes that you didn't even look up. 
[00:57:30]  It's not like, yeah, he's a homeless guy.  Yeah, there he is.  Yeah, nothing changes.  You know, they're in a power position here in the media, but they don't even do their  basic crap.  They don't do their basic research.  So the video on the Drudge Report, and now that the video of Fox News Channel is running,  is of Fezzy, of the Ron and Fez show.  The guy's not homeless.  God bless him.  God, does that make me happy.  Poor man.  Can someone help him?  Probably makes more money than the reporter.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably. 
[00:58:00]  Definitely.  Absolutely.  As well he should.  So that's about it for now, I guess.  But once again, I want to say that Boston and Mayor Menino, they were the only ones that  had a problem with the homeless shopping spree.  Not one other mayor, not one other city, including Jersey and New York, where we're at.  Yeah.  No one around here had a problem with the homeless shopping spree.  No one.  Well, I'm from Boston.  I just want you to know I'm a little offended by the whole thing.  Are you?  Yeah.  I just felt it was awful, the way you guys gave them clothes. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Clothes, food.  Dude, I'm watching.  It was a day.  I can't get enough of the Fezzy video.  He's wearing boots.  I can't get enough of the Fezzy video where he's walking around and he looks disheveled  and he looks a little out of it.  And like you said, I didn't know what the whole eye thing was about, but someone sprayed  it out.  Yeah, sprayed perfume in his eyeball.  Yeah.  And then it shows a couple other homeless guys and it's like, you know what?  No, back to Fezzy.  This guy is the face of the homeless.  He's the face of the homeless now. 
[00:59:00]  They're like, this guy's gold.  Look at him.  Matt Drudge, you dope.  We got to find this guy.  Not realizing there's cops walking with him, protecting them from any problems.  Dude, in the middle of the video, if Fox News Channel, which just aired the video, if they  would have just looked at the video themselves, they would have seen that Fezzy is posing for  pictures.  Yeah.  Because he's famous.  Yeah, he's posing for pictures with fans.  There you go, right there.  Can I have your picture, Fezzy?  Oh, the media, they just don't do their homework or research. 
[00:59:30]  I love it.  They don't.  I absolutely love it.  You can check out the video for yourself on the Drudge Report there.  DrudgeReport.com, I believe, right?  Yes.  And all the videos from the homeless shopping spree on YouTube and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Right.  All right.  Wonderful.  Wonderful day, though, for all the homeless.  About exploiting.  They had a great day.  What's wrong with that?  What the hell is wrong with that?  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Sonny Farrelli.  He's up there in Boston. 
[01:00:00]  Sonny!  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hello.  I'll tell you what.  I was there at the homeless shopping spree, and I just got one thing to say about the  mayor, because I listened to the Ron and Fez show yesterday, and I know what I can say  on the air.  Mayor Menino is a prick.  One.  And he should get it out of the...  I love how he said that, expecting some dramatic response, like, oh, no!  What?  Are you...  You can't say that? 
[01:00:30]  Hum-hum.  Hum-hum.  Yeah.  There was some sort of muttering after you said it.  Yeah.  I'm Mayor Menino.  Here's the countless.  One, two, three, four.  Here's another bomb at the door.  You're batting a thousand there, Sonny.  Wow.  Hey, listen.  I'll tell you what, though.  You know, my wife...  But seriously, folks, he just went into, let me tell you, my wife.  Boy, I bet she can't cook. 
[01:01:00]  Well, you know, she's a hoity-  Boy, am I arms tired.  You know?  And she was getting hell for this, going with me.  Right.  And she even admitted to me afterwards that, you know, it was the nicest thing she's ever  seen.  That must have been a moment.  One of those bums came up to me, said he hadn't had a bite all day.  So I bit him.  Yeah.  Wow, Sonny.  He said, hey, buddy, can you spare a dime? 
[01:01:30]  All right, guys.  Hey, listen, you guys, have a good Christmas, man.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff, what's up?  Boy, he swung and missed so hard, he pulled muscles in his lower back.  That was awful.  We need someone to go through these and get the best ones.  I was down there for the shopping spree.  Wow.  He's a prick.  Wow, what did we do to make him go that far?  He's a prick.  Easy.  Jeff, what's up? 
[01:02:00]  Hey, what's happening, O&A?  Hey, I just want to know, you guys never played that new version of Grey Wolf's new song.  Right.  Yeah, we didn't.  I didn't know if you guys were going to play that or not.  Yeah, where is it?  We did mention that.  I realized it over the weekend.  Me too.  I'm a little leery because the original is so good and so memorable that I'd hate anything  to tarnish it.  I don't mind tarnishing good things.  All right.  You want the original?  You want to say so?  I want you to do one and see if you add it to it.  If not, we'll just break it and taunt them. 
[01:02:30]  That dude came back with, Chubby Checker came back with Twist again.  Twist again.  Twisting on the boardwalk.  Twist like we did last summer.  Exactly.  Boy.  What a...  Talk about going back to the well a few times.  Who is guiding his career?  Somebody who really enjoyed that first number.  Yeah.  All right.  Who wants to explain the Grey Wolf Shelter Me thing?  He's a bum who sang a song and here's another one.  Off the cuff, he sang Shelter Me one day for Tippy Tom. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Just made it up on the spot.  And then Drew Boogie, who's spinning for us live in studio today, he took the raw audio  and made a fine little song.  He did some backing music to it.  And now Grey Wolf, before the homeless shopping spree this year, he handed us a longer version  of the song.  Now Drew's got nothing to do with this?  I don't think so.  Okay.  It's going to suck.  It's going to suck.  See?  It's just going to suck.  Well, maybe it will have potential for Drew to mix it, though.  That's all we need is a bass that Drew can work with. 
[01:03:30]  All right, Drew, give it a listen and hopefully maybe you can spice it up.  Well, I gave him some instrumental music to use if in case he wanted to do it again.  But, you know, if he didn't use it, then we know he might be in trouble.  We believe we have a hit on our hands.  We just can't get it done, though, unfortunately, because he only sang, what, like one chorus  and we think one more chorus and he's in.  Well, that's all he had.  He doesn't write.  Yeah, I understand.  But you think at this point you could make up some crap.  He also doesn't read or shave indoors.  Or sing.  It's just really frustrating everybody because everyone gets into the song and then it ends 
[01:04:00]  too quickly.  So anyway, with that said, he came up with another version of Shelter Me.  We haven't heard this yet.  I hope he jazzed it up with acapella and really douched it up a little bit.  Yeah, really wrecked it.  It's going to be awful.  Like a lounge singer.  We might have to punch out early.  You never know here.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Nice echoey.  Yeah, look, we're going to try this one.  It's a xylophone.  We're about rock and roll Tommy and tibby-toe Tommy. 
[01:04:30]  My name is Gray Wool.  Oh, this is plug in there.  We're going to do this the right way.  Let's yell at him.  Tim Norton, Korgata, New Year's Eve.  Zamfir.  That's the wind blowing through his house.  It's that Native American white guilt flute that they play down in Times Square. 
[01:05:00]  I want to crack his teeth with it.  Get to the sad part, stupid.  Not for the intro.  Exactly.  Oh, just yes.  This is the music version of Shelter Me.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[01:05:30]  Turn the vocals up a little.  What a failure. 
[01:06:00]  Is this a protest song?  What is this instrument?  This is what people hear when they kill their own families in their heads.  This is horrible.  Shelter me from the boring song.  You should be sheltered from the falling bricks.  This is like a bad hair metal lighter song. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  A fan would go to Moscow.  Real bad.  This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  The end of this, this song should close with a single gunshot.  I picture him around the middle of the woods, big hawk flying over, just dropping on him.  Dropping big white gobs on his shoulders.  But he doesn't know what it is.  He keeps saying, shelter me from the falling marshmallow trees and eating them. 
[01:07:00]  If I see him and he has this instrument, I'm going to break it in front of him.  It's only half over, by the way.  Good.  There's got to be more.  He turned it into an Inigata DeVita.  I think Custer's coming.  We're crying in front of a garbage pile. 
[01:07:30]  This is too painful.  We can't do it.  We have to.  It's fantastic.  We can't go to the end with this one.  I'm telling you.  What happened to 8-6-7-5-3-0-9?  He had a hit.  Joe Cocker, H.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  We can't.  It's bad.  It is really, really bad.  Yeah.  Tell him back to the drawing board. 
[01:08:00]  We still don't have it where we want.  Well, Drew had to deal with that before he actually got that great-sounding version.  That's exactly what I had to deal with when I tried to get him to do it.  That's exactly how it sounded, and that's why I didn't bother with it.  It was done.  This was the perfect day.  Like, all the stars were aligned.  This is so frustrating because we're so close to a massive hit.  Maybe we can get him to drink again.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got to drink.  He's got to turn up the vocals.  We'll go to break with the original. 
[01:08:30]  Listen to how great this is, but it's only, it's barely a minute and a half long.  It's best left just like that.  You tell him, if he plays that instrument again, I'm going to break his hands with a hammer.  While he's playing, I'm going to smash, like, above the knuckle where the middle of the hand is to break all five fingers at once.  All right, listen.  I'll tell him.  I will ruin his typing hand.  Bill Burr's here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We go to break with the original.  Listen how cool this freaking thing is.  This is when he was drunk.  Yeah, and the new version he handed in. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, there it goes.  Yep.  Flying across the room.  I was going for a dramatic smash there and hit a couch, bounce back, almost hit me in the eye.  Great.  Opie threw it into a pile of fluff and I was going for the dramatic smash.  I had a duck as it came back at me.  Here's the original.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got to break.  I'm going to do it.  Ah, this is nice. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, you're a fool.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tiffy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  He played that night.  And I have nowhere to go.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad, get out of here. 
[01:10:00]  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, get out of here.  And he says, get out of here. 
[01:10:30]  My life, I'm living with so much pain. 
[01:11:00]  And it's just a little piece.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtime.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's hear it for Flavor Flames. 
[01:11:30]  Flavor Flames.  Everybody say, oh!  Everybody say, oh!  Everybody say, oh!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Drew Boogie spinning live in studio today. 
[01:12:00]  Good old Flavor Flav, hijacking our Halloween party.  My God, man.  Remember that?  Oh, God, do I remember that.  One of the highlights of the year for the Opie and Anthony Show.  It certainly was.  He's being punked by a 60-year-old black man.  He was supposed to do five, maybe ten minutes on that stage for us  in the middle of all the other debauchery we had.  And he ended up doing an hour and 20 minutes, if you add it all up.  An hour and 20 minutes.  Gregory just took over the show. 
[01:12:30]  We didn't have a cover.  He shut him up.  He thought it was his night.  No one had the balls to tell him,  could you please get off the stage?  We're done with you.  It's not the party.  It's not your party.  Change your show, Elias.  Yeah.  Guy had no freaking clue.  Bill Burr in studio.  And now we've got to also say hi to Louis C.K. in studio.  Hey, guys.  Louis.  Another Boston boy.  Yes, another Boston boy.  It's all Boston boys today.  By the way, someone's saying, look, don't take it out on us.  You know, we don't like the mayor or whatever.  We're not taking it out on the city of Boston. 
[01:13:00]  What happened?  Oh, wow.  What happened?  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Sorry.  We just did it for an hour and a half.  We did our homeless shopping spree.  Okay.  I don't want to.  And Boston and Mayor Menino.  Yeah.  That was the only problem we had.  Oh.  Across America.  He was upset that WBCN was airing it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It wasn't even happening up in his city.  But he was upset that the radio station was airing it on the day that they were going out  and counting the homeless. 
[01:13:30]  I think he was upset that you guys.  That's funny.  That's ironic.  He's like, how funny is that?  That they're taking them out, feeding them, clothing them, having thousands of listeners  give their own money to buy them clothes and stuff on a day where we're going to be pointing  a finger and going, one, two, three, four.  That's horrible of us, isn't it?  Singing 99 disappointments on the wall.  Yeah.  So he was the only mayor and Boston was the only city that had a problem with the homeless  shopping spree.  What a douche. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, no kidding.  He really is.  Sounds familiar.  Yep.  And now Fox News Channel is doing reports on it and they're showing a video that's on  drudgereport.com.  It's taking on a life of its own there, Louis.  Wow.  It's busy.  Good for them.  But there you have it.  We support the homeless.  I'm from there, but I kind of hate Boston in some ways.  You guys are from there, too.  Didn't you have a show there?  Oh, we had a show.  We were not from there, though.  No.  Yeah, they got fired when they said this guy was dead, but he really wasn't.  I can't.  Yeah.  Who was it, I guess? 
[01:14:30]  And, you know, the same guy that's, you know.  He's kind of holding a grudge.  We did that eight years ago.  We paid for it.  We got fired.  We got kicked out of radio for a while.  Yeah, so.  Guy holds a grudge like he holds that office.  He won't leave.  They won't vote him out.  What is he?  Does he run uncontested every election?  Does he run uncontested every election?  Because no one seems to be able to defeat this guy.  He can't talk.  You would think if one guy could deliver a speech.  You can't refute any of the points he makes.  Hey, taxis.  And there's a big deal. 
[01:15:00]  Well, it sounded good.  Heard a couple of key words.  Actually, we got actual audio of Mayor Menino.  Ah.  Now it's my pleasure to induce our senior senator.  That's really hard.  Our senior senator.  Listen to what he said, introduce.  Do you hear introduce?  Introduce.  Induce.  Induce our senior senator.  Now it's my pleasure.  Introduce our senior senator.  That is the mayor of Boston for the rest of the year.  Induce our senior senator. 
[01:15:30]  So he was going to introduce the senior senator, but he says this.  Well, maybe he says no.  He's outraged.  Introduce.  Our senior senator.  Ah.  Ah.  Our senior senator.  We had a bunch of Menino clips.  Yeah, I got them all right here.  Listen, here's another one.  Yeah, I got to hear a couple.  I don't know what's going on.  Oh, sweetie.  Hold on a minute.  Is it in Iraq's future?  Health Commission has also created an emergency preparedness guide called Live Learn Prepare. 
[01:16:00]  Live.  Live.  Live.  It's live.  It's live.  New York.  It's live, learn, prepare.  Is that what it is?  Live, learn, prepare.  Live.  The Boston Public Health Commission has also created an emergency preparedness guide called  Live Learn Prepare.  Piece of garbage.  How about it?  I like how he's trying to make it dramatic.  Yeah.  It's also called.  It's also called.  Dramatic.  Live. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, no.  Livey.  What a tool.  Much like a cookie.  Huh?  Hold on.  Let me get another one in here.  Much like a cookie, I predict the Yankee dynasty will crumble and the results will be delicious  for Red Sox fans.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Much like a cookie.  So he's much like a cookie? 
[01:17:00]  Much like a cookie.  Yeah.  Much like a cookie, I will, like a cookie, would totally predict.  You know something?  Last time I heard that.  You know, cookies are totally...  Someone brought up that point.  Listen to the context, the way he puts that together.  The way he says it, he is a cookie.  He totally is a cookie.  He's the cookie.  Much like a cookie, I will predict the Yankee dynasty will crumble.  Come on.  I got to hear that again.  And I love how dramatic he gets.  He's all dramatic because he's going to say something really important here.  Profound.  Much like a cookie, I predict the Yankee dynasty will crumble. 
[01:17:30]  And the results will be delicious for Red Sox fans.  Red Sox fans.  He should say, I predict, much like a cookie, or even that is a little much.  I predict that.  That, right.  Comma, much like a cookie.  Much like a cookie.  Comma, the Yankee dynasty will crumble.  Or he should say, I predict that much like a cookie, a Yankee pitcher will smash into a building in a small plane. 
[01:18:00]  I mean, it makes as much sense.  I like how he can't think of more than one word at a time.  No.  They look like they're teleprompters, like those cards from Bob Dylan video.  One big word.  Right.  I, much like a cookie.  This guy's from the Bronx.  He has no clue about the mayor, but he's enjoying this.  Shane from the Bronx, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Shane, Jimmy.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  After every clip I'm expecting to hear, live from New York, it's Saturday night. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Sounds like a goof.  Oswald from Whackbag.  Mayor Menino equals half a Hulk tongue.  Yeah.  This is like when Rupert Pupkin had the cue cards for Jerry Lewis, and they were all like wrong.  This is not a gang.  Yeah.  It's like, I have a gun pointed at my head.  Here's another one.  That's one thing that really fries my nose.  Fries my nose.  Fries his nose. 
[01:19:00]  Is that the saying?  No.  No.  Burns my toes.  Burns my ass.  Burns my toes.  Burns my nose.  Yeah, burns my ass.  That's one thing that really.  I'm trying to think of the two expressions he put together.  Yeah, fries my.  Skin a cat.  No, that's not it.  Something that, no, is that really.  He's not qualified to be mayor of Boston.  No.  But he's been there forever.  We've been gone for eight years, and he's been there ever since then.  And he was there a few years before we got there.  We're facing the wrath of Menino.  He put two quotes together that don't exist. 
[01:19:30]  That's right.  He makes metaphors don't exist.  That really makes my nose want to go out and hurt a jewel.  I don't know what that means, but that's how my nose feels when I hear that.  By the way, we have 50 of these.  Yeah.  So this isn't one of those rare things.  We're not going to play all 50, but we've got a list of 50.  He is horrid.  I have did my duty, and I did it last Tuesday, Matt.  I can't believe I'm ahead of the schedule.  He did his duty last Tuesday as the head of his schedule for dutying. 
[01:20:00]  Sounds like every conversation we have on break.  True.  I couldn't do my duty.  I'm about getting the job done.  I want to work on this and get it done in a peacefully way.  Peacefully way.  Peacefully way.  Oh, is he just a dope?  It looks like he just memorized a bunch of expressions that a politician is supposed to say.  Yeah.  And he can't quite remember me.  And got them all slightly wrong. 
[01:20:30]  I know that Billy Bollinger is president of University Mass now, of which I am alumnus.  I am a alumnus.  I am alumnus.  A alumnus.  I am a alumnus.  I am a alumnus.  I'm announcing I must step down as mayor because I'm battling alumnus.  It's just that he's at which I am and he's so excited to get to you at the end of the  sentence. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  His rush is there.  I am alumnus.  A which alumnus.  He's tongue-ness.  Big fat piece of cow meat in his mouth.  But I also say, anyone who does this work is not for money.  I don't do it for money.  Let me tell you that, my friend.  I see my friends and what they're doing in life.  I say, my God.  You know, I grew up in the streets of Hyde Park.  My father worked in a factory, so I wasn't born with a golden spoon. 
[01:21:30]  I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  A gold, it's a silver spoon in your mouth.  That's the guy, he's lazy.  He's like, a born spoon.  I'm going home.  Think of any element.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a spoon born and you work out the rest.  People can't believe this.  A bird in a bush.  People can't believe this is the actual mayor of Boston, by the way.  Yeah.  They're calling from all over the country now.  Yes, this is the mayor that had a problem with our homeless shopping spree.  Don't chicken hatch.  What? 
[01:22:00]  We all know that's completely a major project like this.  It takes real teamwork.  Let's be stopped by thanking our federal and state partners along with our congressional delegation.  He's like Christopher Reeves.  That's what he's talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Delegration.  Let's be stopped by thanking our federal and state partners along with our congressional delegation for standing by us. 
[01:22:30]  Standing by us.  Standing by us.  What an idiot.  What?  Meanwhile, plates fall on people's cars.  What is Iraq?  What's wrong, Iraq?  No, that was me.  Sorry about that.  Oh.  You elected me three times.  So, you know, I am not a fancy talker.  That's for sure.  You old salt, you.  So deprecating humor. 
[01:23:00]  Boy, you really show your underbelly, you good old guy.  You old salt.  Oh, jeez.  I like that self-decimating humor.  It's awesome.  It's almost like he was calling people idiots.  Yeah, hey.  You guys elected me three times.  You're the idiot that put me here.  How much do I have to screw up?  That's for sure.  What am I supposed to do if you vote for me?  Not take the job?  You're the idiots.  I really cared about what he said.  He wasn't just saying the words like a lot of elected officials or former elected officials would do. 
[01:23:30]  He was a man of a great, great statue in our city.  A man of great, great statue.  Oh, what a tool.  He met Charles Stewart.  I know.  It's not like he mispronounces the words.  He just says another word.  No, he just says the wrong word.  Great, great statue.  AT&T has a sponsor, you know, this whole summer program with me.  And you want Sprint to come in and do something they do, diddly dunk. 
[01:24:00]  What the?  Diddly dunk?  Good old diddly dunk.  That one will catch on.  He just opens his mouth and makes noises.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Monday, Tuesday, wagon, Thursday.  He's just got a W.  It's going to start with the same letter and then it'll just be any word.  Then it doesn't matter what it is.  Let's go to Pennsylvania.  Mike, what's up?  Much like a cookie, I will sit in the center of eight men. 
[01:24:30]  Who say, we're going to end homeless, but there's no resources to end homeless.  How do we do that?  End homeless.  End homeless.  End homeless.  End homelessness.  He just doesn't care.  We're going to end homeless.  You're right.  After the first couple words, it doesn't make a difference.  It doesn't matter.  As long as people can count it for the...  We need to work for the people elbow 12-9.  He's fixing crypto quotes.  Washington refused to learn from cities that when they cut these programs, people who can't find shelter end up homeless. 
[01:25:00]  It's like he unwinds like an old clock.  He just runs out of steam.  End up homelessness.  And then he used homelessness kind of at the end of that, which just needed end up homeless.  Right.  It's like...  But he's trying to sound like a Kennedy.  He's trying to come from that tradition.  Yeah.  JFK after the shot.  That's what he sounds like. 
[01:25:30]  Like, ask not what you're going to do in a word.  Another word and then word.  It's almost like he knows he's going to screw it up, so he tries to get as much momentum as he can.  Exactly.  Get the energy up before he screws up.  It almost sounds like he's starting the next sentence too fast.  Like, he kind of runs out of steam and he just wants to rush for the next sentence.  I've been a douchebag.  The reason we don't have pot-up parties this time,  because of the large crowds, what's happened in the past, 
[01:26:00]  they knock them over and they use them as weapons.  And it's a safety problem.  So we have, you know, we have several public toilets at City Hall,  both in the lower level and in the entrance,  and they could use those facilities also.  There's a school department next door, which has the public facilities also.  And so I think, you know, I'd rather air on the side of safety than the accommodations.  Air on the side of safety. 
[01:26:30]  Drop the portable toilet.  Drop it.  Drop it or you will be tased.  Drop the toilet.  Yeah, how many times I've been held up in security on a plane  because someone's trying to bring a porta potty through?  We got one in their pocket next to their lighter.  Oh, is that great?  Today we dedicate this flack, which will serve as a remember.  Reminder, remind him.  It's a big day for someone, I think. 
[01:27:00]  We got to dedicate this flack.  I got to hear that one again.  We dedicate this flack.  Today we dedicate this flack, which will serve as a remember.  Reminder, remind him.  Remember, reminder, reminder.  Hey, that's the word.  We got millions of these, by the way.  There's so many.  And where will it actually start?  And will the duck boats go out onto the Charles?  No, we can't put skates on the ducks. 
[01:27:30]  We're not going on the Charles.  Okay.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  No, you can't put skates on ducks.  Man speaks the truth.  Well, there's a boat called a duck.  The duck to us.  We shouldn't be talking about the settlement, don't I?  I mean, the settlement is money, monetary.  I think it's more important to think about the family.  What?  The money, monetary.  I know that guy.  Money, monetary.  He owes me money, son of a bitch.  It doesn't say people cannot walk to the garden or run to the garden. 
[01:28:00]  It means that people cannot conjugate on the garden.  You know, three or more people congregate on the Boston public garden.  Conjugate.  On the public garden over the next several weeks, they'll be banned.  We'll have more police presence on the common.  Conjugate the verb.  Conjugate.  Conjugate.  How do you vote for a guy that doesn't know what congregate means?  Stop conjugating there.  Stop it.  I see you.  I heard what you said.  You can't give prisoners congregate visits.  What a dope.  Can you believe it took us 86 years to win a World Series?  Yeah.  You know what?  I never felt sorry for Boston fans because of the World Series. 
[01:28:30]  I grew up there my whole life, and I think they deserved every crappy year that that  team ever turned in because it's just bitter.  People in Boston, they're suspicious of winners.  Like, if you leave town and you do a little bit good, you come back to like, yeah, yeah,  so?  Yeah.  They're just awful people.  Oh, big shot.  Yeah, yeah.  Big shot.  Big shot.  Did you see Dennis Leary's thing about the curse of the Bambino?  There's like a whole documentary they did about why can't Boston win and what was the curse? 
[01:29:00]  And then like 30 minutes in, they mentioned, oh, yeah, they didn't use any black players  forever.  Like, you know, Willie Mays tried out and they said, go home.  That's a surprise.  But why is it the piano in the pond?  Like, what is, like, why can't they win?  Oh, yeah, no black players until 1978.  But what is the, but why the mysterious ethereal curse?  Look at this ducky jumping all over the place.  Get him out of here. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Fitzy, you're in center.  Yeah, you're in center.  You play center.  Bring in the bases on your way in, you faggot.  It's an awful son.  Sully, get out there and shortstop.  Hey, people are reminding us of other Menino clips here.  There's a couple more to play.  Yeah, hope burns eternal in Boston.  And every year we start off, we hope will serve as a championship.  Last year we got to the fifth game.  And now maybe this is the year.  All right.  That was all right.  Like a cookie.  That was all right. 
[01:30:00]  This is much, much like a cookie.  Much like a cookie.  Much like a cookie.  I have chocolate chips in me.  Listen to this one.  This is classic.  He was reading to, I think, third graders.  Dear Fama Fama, the Bion, the Bion is very cold.  The Bion.  The Bion.  The Bion.  It's a third grade book.  It's very cold.  No, the Bion is very cold, too.  That's how it's called.  The Bion.  Yeah, that's click, clack, moo.  Aw.  It is.  Aw. 
[01:30:30]  You're a good daddy.  Click, clack, moo.  Click, clack, moo.  It's about a book.  It's about some cows that get a typewriter.  They start writing notes to the farmer.  I'm sure that book stinks.  Writing speeches for the mayor.  I think we have one more here.  Boston, is it a minority, majority, city?  He's asking.  I tried to say diverse.  It was beyond him.  So he decided to, oh, there's more.  I'm trying to move on.  Those two words are opposites, too. 
[01:31:00]  It's a minority, majority.  Boston is a full, empty city of majority, minority people.  There's got to be a question.  It's a full, empty city.  Full, empty city.  Like I said, it's about reinforcing the economic lessons that taught during the school day. 
[01:31:30]  Economic?  Economic?  What?  This should have been your response to his criticism.  You just paste all these together.  Actually, this kind of is.  People are listening today to hear our response, and this is it.  You guys should do this on the air.  You should totally do this on the radio.  On the radio.  On the radio.  When you do your show later.  That would be crazy.  I really am an idiot.  Why put it on the radio in front of millions?  You should send it in an email.  Yeah.  To that lady at the Herald.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  Can I hear this?  Does it serve the kids better?  I didn't get that one.  I says.  I says.  He writes.  I mean, he says.  I says.  Listen.  I says.  Does it serve the kids better?  All right.  Want to move on?  I mean, we could go all day with this.  And that's to be so important to me as a city, as mayor, but also to the city of Boston.  To me, the city.  Important to me as a city.  As a city.  Not only, but the city of Boston.  He's cooking on a city.  He can't think of his money. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, this is the mayor of.  This is a famous one, too.  Listen to this.  Are you going to make any bets with the mayor at Oakland?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he'll probably give us a spaceship for Jerry Brown.  We know Jerry Brown.  Yeah.  A spaceship versus some good seafood.  All right.  He's quick on his feet.  Oh, my God.  Can he improv?  He's quick on his feet. 
[01:33:00]  He was going with a Jerry Brown kind of being out there, a little spacey.  Yeah.  So a spaceship.  Yeah.  Because he couldn't think of anything else for what?  What city?  For Oakland.  There was Oakland.  I can think of a few things he could trade.  I don't think Boston wants them.  I would fire a bartender for talking like this.  He's a mayor.  He'd be like, dude, people don't want to hear you.  It's one of the great traditions of Boston.  St. Patrick's Day breakfast.  And Jackie House did a great job for the first time ever. 
[01:33:30]  At least they couldn't do it.  Well, he rose to the occasion again.  And he's just done a great job.  And, you know, the governor and Shane O'Brien, they're all been good morning.  Great jokes and great time.  Good morning, great jokes.  He's just, you're right.  He lives word to word.  He goes, stop.  Good, good.  What words go with good?  Good morning.  Good morning.  He was a very good morning.  All right.  His own throat was rebelling against his stupid words that were coming out of it. 
[01:34:00]  It was shutting down.  His brain shut down on occasion or whatever it was.  He's like, oh, forget it.  Have to be flexible.  And that's where if we're all flexible, we get through this issue.  And I just say that it's difficult.  It will be difficult.  I was just saying flexible.  But that's an easy one.  All right.  Many people wonder in our nation's cities about how to solve homelessness. 
[01:34:30]  There's two solutions for homelessness.  More housing.  Affordable housing.  Jesus.  That's a solution, I would say.  House.  You know what?  If you're playing Family Feud, I think that might be the number one answer right there.  You had to decide between housing and outdoor space.  That would be the solution there, sir.  I would say more housing. 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  Number one answer on the board.  More water fountains.  Strike.  Strike.  Strike.  How would you solve the drug problem?  I think if I said less drugs.  Less drugs.  Less drugs.  Less drugs, yes.  Number one answer.  Good morning.  More diarrhea in my mouth.  Oh, sorry, Mayor.  That's not going to help the homeless.  What about the problem with traffic? 
[01:35:30]  Uh, less cars.  Ah, number one answer.  Uh, more, more water.  Oh.  Oh.  Boats.  Oh.  Oh, no, the traffic problem.  What about the problem of...  Buses, buses, Mayor.  Ah. 
[01:36:00]  What about the problem of huge metal plates squishing women as they drive through the big dig?  Uh, less...  Less...  Uh, metal plates squishing women.  Uh, yes.  Uh, less corruption in the city.  Oh, of course.  Who's on that button?  Oh, it's the construction workers.  Uh, let's listen.  Let's listen.  Uh, yeah.  More housing.  Affordable housing.  And better health care. 
[01:36:30]  That's two solutions.  I mean, the issue with homelessness is we do a survey in the city every year.  We go out and count homelessness.  Homelessness.  In the first week in December.  Homelessness.  He doesn't want to say ness.  Like, that's wasting...  No.  The problem with homelessness...  Okay.  Homelessness.  His problem is...  The problem with homelessness is...  That's too many nissnesses.  Nissnesses.  The problem with homelessness is...  Nissnessnesses.  The problem with homoza...  The problem with homoza...  They want to get married. 
[01:37:00]  Of course, we're going to end homeless, but there's no resources to end homeless.  How do we do that?  He said...  That's how he says it.  It's not a slip of the tongue.  It's homeless.  He's decided to drop the niss.  Yeah.  Not only is he a moron, he...  It sounds like he has some sort of respiratory problem.  Like, he can't...  Yeah.  He's got not enough air to get his retarded views out with the words out.  So, he's got to clip every word.  Yeah.  Just a little bit of every word.  He's got somebody blowing air up his ass.  And then it comes...  And then he kind of waits until he feels some...  It's like a big bagpipe.  Thanks, Tony.  Okay, now I can talk again. 
[01:37:30]  Anthony, one of those things you use to get the fire going.  Yeah, one of those...  Bellows.  Bellows.  There you go.  Are you asking?  Is Anthony the oldest guy?  Oh, he knows every...  He knows a little bit about everything.  Yes, I remember using the bellows.  Here, we'll end...  The steel mill.  We could do this all day where we have at least 20 to 30 more.  But the girl that sang, I Saw the Soin, she is in studio today to do karaoke for us.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my God.  We'll explain to Louis C.K. next.  I've heard this. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, you did hear this?  She's awesome.  All right, all right.  She's the best.  She's awesome.  We got one more Mayor Menino clip.  The vice president is saying it's heightening the intensity, it seems, a little bit here.  What's your level of concern?  Well, our intelligent unit is working with the state, federal officials, keeping us informed  if there's any heightening of our security in the city of Boston.  So we're working with the federal officials to give us the information that we might need.  Do you think they're playing politics, sir?  I'm not saying they're playing politics. 
[01:38:30]  So, you know, I don't have the intelligence they have.  Yeah, well.  They'll let us know if there's a heightening of our security.  A heightening.  Like, that's it.  Oh, finally, this is the one I wanted to play.  He's trying to redo a famous speech here, and he just fails miserably.  And someone else asked if he'd be interested in running for Senator Kerry's seat, should he  win the nomination?  What do you want to say?  I will not be a candidation I'll seek, but I'll accept a draft.  I will not be a candidation?  A candidation or seek. 
[01:39:00]  And he got a laugh, too.  A candidation I will not seek.  What?  I will seek.  I will not seek.  Well, he can take back anything he says.  Yeah.  Because you said you weren't going to run.  I didn't say I wasn't going to run.  I said I was a candidation.  Candidation?  Not even a word, are you idiots?  It's not a word.  Can't hold me to that.  You think I'm that stupid?  I know it's not a word, and that means I'm not committed.  All right.  We'll keep it there.  We could go on.  But we got Louis C.K. in studio.  Bill Burns in studio.  Bill, are you promoting anything? 
[01:39:30]  Improv.  West Palm Beach.  I sound like Menino right now.  28th through the 31st.  Homeless.  Comediness.  Homelessness.  For more comediness, we need more comedy clubs.  More.  Very good.  Louis, are you promoting anything?  I'm going to be at Caroline's in New York City the 4th through the 7th of January.  I got an HBO special called Shameless coming out January 13th.  Louis C.K. on HBO. 
[01:40:00]  Very nice.  Nice.  All right, the girl that sang, I swore.  Do we have that going into break?  It's on the...  Yeah, play a little piece of it.  Don't ruin it.  We did a MacBook karaoke thing, and she came up with this as we go to break.  She's here live to do the long version, but here's a taste on the Opie and Anthony show.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm a new person. 
[01:40:30]  I'm a new person like you.  I'm dreaming you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign. 
[01:41:00]  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  I'm new to you, you belong.

[01:42:00]  How cool is that?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Drew Boogie spinning live in studio today.  That's awesome.  Taking the E-Rock shut up clip and putting it to music.  That wasn't E-Rock.  That was Jimmy.  Oh, that was Jimmy.  That's right.  E-Rock was short.  E-Rock said, shut up like a faggot. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, you're right.  But I sang it like a man.  Jimmy wanted to say that to some guy that used to whistle, is it, or sing in school.  Some guy was whistling in the hallway.  He was whistling in the hallway, and instead of going for the gusto and the big joke.  In front of the whole class.  By saying, shut the F up.  You kind of tamed it down.  Yeah, I bailed out.  I'm really embarrassed.  Like, the guy walked by the hallway, and the whole, it was dead silent in this math class.  And I should have sang back, because he was singing something to that, that was his cadence 
[01:43:00]  when he sang.  So had I sang, shut the F up, back, it would have murdered.  Oh, yeah.  It would have been unfollowable enough.  Right.  But, you know, coward, faggot bailed out at the last second, and I went, shut up.  Awkwardly went, shut up.  It got a minus one.  No one, I've never been more humiliated in my life.  The teacher didn't even yell at me. 
[01:43:30]  I hate you.  She was in bed.  I hate you for that now.  I'm not horrid.  Retroactively, I hate you.  She should have thrown me out of class in a moment of glory.  I should have went to see the principal, but instead she just looked up as if she pitied  the unfunny nothing.  Sophomore, a bunch of honest, a bunch of students.  Those are life decimating moments.  They are.  When you're, I was in fourth grade, and I had, my pants were always split at the crotch,  because my mother shopped at King's Department Store, which isn't even a store anymore.  King's Department Store. 
[01:44:00]  And so my pants were always split at the crotch, and I was in fourth grade, I'm eating snack  at snack time, and I had a boner, and I didn't, I wasn't aware of it.  Just this little pin pushing my undies through the hole in my crotch, and I'm just unaware  of it.  And this girl, Jill Casavan, who was the sweet, like she was the one I wanted, she pointed  at my crotch and went, eh, and the whole class pointed and went, eh.  Oh, God, that's a hard one to lose down.  That moment is me.  That's who I am. 
[01:44:30]  I'm that guy.  You're that guy.  It's defined.  My whole life has been regretted that moment.  That's right up there with the guy that throws up, or the girl that throws up in the cafeteria.  No, that's you.  That's you, then.  I mean, even when, like, I'm watching my daughter being born the whole time, I'm thinking, ah,  that was awful.  My boner was sticking up.  In the third grade.  That's how awful those moments were.  Wow.  Self-hate.  They carry on with you, yeah, your whole life.  Yeah.  Mine's a little different than that, but. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, well.  Imagine.  One friend walks in and catches you doing something to another friend, you know.  Laughs all around.  Yeah, you know, a lot of laughs.  All right, listen, we got Miss USA doing coke and kissing Miss Teen USA.  What a great story.  That story gets hotter and hotter.  By the day.  If that stupid Trump throws her out, I'll do nothing, but I just think it's a bad move.  I hope he doesn't. 
[01:45:30]  That would be hilarious.  He shouldn't.  Oh, we got the latest on that?  No one talks about Miss USA or none of these dummies, except for now everyone's talking  about her.  Yeah, whenever there's controversy.  She should do coke.  She's been in bars.  They're talking about her drinking before she was 21.  She just turned 21, I think.  But when she was underage, she's drinking, smoking pot, doing some coke, a little promiscuity.  She was taking coke.  Certain liberties with the gentlemen.  She's from Kentucky, right?  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  What would be the point of being hot if you're not getting high paid?  And she's a roommate with Miss Teen USA, and they had a make-out session.  Oh, my God.  So it just gets hotter and hotter.  Oh, my God.  This could be the best thing to happen to the USA pageant.  Trump is the best thing to happen in America.  Of course it is.  Listen to the dumb reporter, what they come up with here.  Crown glitter on each of their thighs.  I'd like to be a billionaire prince and just pay them so much money to have sex with them 
[01:46:30]  and then fart the whole time we're having sex.  I would just do that, and they would have to keep going because I was giving them so much  money.  I would just fart and mumble whore, and then have to smile and pretend it was fun.  Pretend?  Hey, here's the latest.  The moment of truth is approaching for the young Miss USA, Tara Conner.  She could hear this morning whether the pageant owner, Donald Trump, is going to say,  you're fired.  Forced her to give up her crown.  And I have to give back the crown. 
[01:47:00]  The entertainment correspondent, Brooke Anderson, has more.  Oh, it has been an ugly path for this young lady.  It has been very ugly.  You know, the allegations that have put Tara Conner in this predicament are not pretty.  Reports of wild nights out.  Reports that she hasn't shown up to engagements and appearances.  And much, much more.  Why don't they, like, why doesn't she make a funny example?  She's going to use it like, you know, Donald Trump may remove her crown a la Princess Diana. 
[01:47:30]  How do they take this crap seriously?  I don't know.  Like, what big thing is Miss USA that she can't have laid?  The thing I don't understand, it's like with Britney Spears' vagina and Janet Jackson's boobs,  this is what we're supposed to want from these people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole point of Britney Spears is her vagina.  That's the entire, like, crux of her kiss.  Ground zero.  And then we see it and we go, oh, faux pas.  Oh, what is she doing? 
[01:48:00]  The whole point of a beauty pageant is that you wish you could have sex with those women.  And then one of them kisses another woman and there's a problem?  Yeah.  With who?  I don't understand.  The Britney Spears thing.  It was the most downloaded thing on Google.  Yeah.  We all want to, but then everybody publicly says, what's wrong with her?  Oh, look how she's fallen.  That really should have been the end of her career.  Like, that should have been, ta-da.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the whole point of her career.  Yeah, this is what you've been waiting for for eight years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or whatever. 
[01:48:30]  But the whole point of her career is that there's just, like, swimming pools of sperm being  dumped in her honor every day.  Teenage boys are masturbating to her face.  Yeah.  Voice.  Stomach.  And stomach.  Likeness.  Guilty.  And then she shows the vagina, and they go, oh, hey, hey, what are you doing?  I wouldn't fault Tara Connor if she made out with Dakota Fanning.  It wouldn't bug me.  I don't know how much of that made the air, because I'm sure Al is dumping out like crazy. 
[01:49:00]  All right, Al.  All right, Al, you got all that.  All right, here's more on Miss USA.  She just turned legal on Monday, celebrating her 21st birthday.  But by many accounts, her partying began way before then.  Yeah, man.  She's been drinking really heavily, drinking in public.  She was caught smooching Miss Teen USA at a club in New York City, and she apparently  failed a drug test for cocaine.  Oh, my God.  All right, winner.  Let's run with her.  She's basically a sophomore in college.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's acting her age. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  She's got her bad.  Right.  Tara Connor is a Kentucky beauty queen.  She began her pageant career at the tender age of four.  A year ago, she was a model slash student slash waitress.  And on April 21st, she was named Miss USA 2006.  She left her high school sweetheart and moved to New York City and wore her sash with pride.  On the subway.  On the subway.  On the subway.  On the subway.  The tender age of four.  There's something, like, pedophilish about her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She began her beauty pageant career at the tender age of four. 
[01:50:00]  Is that her right there?  They're like veal.  They're like veal.  They're like, man.  That's how much she was for?  No, that's a new picture, Jimmy.  She's like a little bit of a gut, though.  Is that?  She does.  Jesus.  Dude.  She drinks a lot.  Picky, picky, picky.  What is that?  That's her hip bone.  That's gut.  That's hip bone.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  She has a little seed belly.  That is a belly.  Oh, where?  Are you in the middle or on the side?  I think it's an awful swimsuit. 
[01:50:30]  On the side is a hip bone.  It's an awful little swimsuit thing she's wearing.  She's not that hot.  She has a dumb little fat part of her stomach.  Oh, my God.  She looks like me, like an appendix scar.  Look at this.  I have the same little gut she does.  A little fat undershadowing.  Can you take that?  What is wrong with you?  You know what, Jimmy?  You do.  You look just like her.  Well, just from that part.  Yeah, lift your shirt up again, man.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's the same belly.  She does have a little awning there, doesn't she?  Does it?  Yes. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Oh, what's wrong with you guys?  Teen USA's head doesn't get wet when it rains.  What do you want from women?  I don't know.  Just not a fat gut when you represent the whole country.  That's not a fat gut.  How about that?  How about that?  How about that?  Do a Pilates, you slob.  Oh, my God.  Now she's a slob.  She's a slob.  She's disgusted at her mediocrity.  She should be thrown out of the pageant for her pig stomach.  Because she gained a pound, right?  Exactly.  Beat it, pig belly.  She stopped eating toilet paper and drinking coffee. 
[01:51:30]  Throw up for America.  Yeah.  Here's the other shot.  You can even see a little bit on the side.  Yeah.  See that little dent on the side?  I'm not a perfectionist, believe me.  It's not a scratch on your Maserati.  It's a woman with actual nutritionified woman.  Exactly.  Look over here.  Look at the way the gut's sticking out of time there.  Look at that.  You're getting a little picky there.  She's trying to hide it with that frilly thing.  I'm not trying to hide it.  I'm not getting picky.  She is.  She's Miss USA.  She's supposed to be the hottest one.  Yeah, but that's not going to make her hot to be a gross skeleton. 
[01:52:00]  No, but how about not gut hanging all over her?  That's not your muscle.  A sloppy whore.  Gut hanging all over.  She does.  You would just tell her to go to hell.  No, I'd have sexual.  I'd have brutal forced sexual.  Yeah.  That's what she's good for?  From the front and back.  Trying to work that gut off.  Yeah, just trying to work off those.  All right.  We got another story to get to before we get to the I Saw the Sign girl.  Where is she, by the way?  She's in the green room?  I said hello.  She smells good.  She's warming up to do I Saw the Sign live for us?  Yeah, she's gargling with glass. 
[01:52:30]  How did her stomach look, Jim?  Oh, she looked good.  She looked all right?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to get to her after the break there, Steve.  A Daytona beach man is in jail this morning for strangling his grandmother with an extension cord she was using to hang Christmas lights.  Police say he offered to help her put up the decorations, but police say he had an ulterior motive the whole time.  We say he strangled her and then slit her throat.  A while later, family members discovered the body and ran for a neighbor for help.  Music. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, honey.  Bam, bam, bam.  He trimmed the tree.  Oh, my God.  I like the fact that he strangled her and then cut her throat.  He really hated that neck.  Oh, my God.  That neck was awful.  What the hell did Grandma do to you?  He wanted blinking lights, and she wouldn't put the little thing in the end.  The little blinking bulb in.  See, both stories are great.  I mean, originally, at first, you picture that she's hanging them and saying something like,  these lights are hot, and he just shut up, and he just strangled her.  But the idea that it was premeditated, he's like, yeah, go ahead, Grandma.  Hang these.  Hang the lights. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, go up on the ladder.  It's nice.  It's Christmas.  For a neighbor for help.  I get closer and I look.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Somebody slit this lady's throat.  Police say the man has confessed, and he is now charged with first-degree murder.  So I have a red-striped man.  Those, you know, she was up on this little step stool with those half-calf stockings.  Yeah.  All stretched out and rolled out, showing her aged, liver-spotted skin that's transparent. 
[01:54:00]  The blue veins.  Marble white vagina lips.  Bloodless, bloodless vagina.  Oh, there's just nothing pumping anywhere.  And he was disgusted with her and had a choker.  The other part is, if they remove the body, some family member has to come in and take  the lights down off the tree.  You have to unwrap the lights.  The lights that Grandma was choked with.  That one coagulated part that you don't touch. 
[01:54:30]  Do I fix them or take them down?  Yeah.  Because she didn't finish.  Do you leave them up in her honor or put them back in the box?  Just leave them there.  Pop the star on top.  Boil them back up into the box.  Right for next year.  Merry Christmas.  Can I put these on my tree with this pulp and her throat skin?  Do we have time for one more?  This is a great story, too.  Marble white.  That's out there today.  At Wheaton North High School, the mission is to create self-directed students who make  sound decisions.  Last week, one of those students decided to do the unthinkable when officials say he spiked 
[01:55:00]  a container of cafeteria salad dressing with his own semen.  Police say an attempted aggravated battery arrest is imminent.  An act occurred that could have physically harmed someone at the school, but no one was  physically harmed.  It wasn't Jim.  Why did you go back for four helpings?  I don't know.  It was delicious.  Oh, my God.  It was a fantastic beverage.  Good for him.  Well, the students and the school react, of course. 
[01:55:30]  Everyone knows about it in the school.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone knows.  And everyone is universally repulsed.  The whole school is disgusted.  That's got to be the sickest thing I've ever heard in my life.  It's just pretty gross that someone actually would do that.  Yeah, it's been going on for a month or so.  That's what we've all been hearing.  But school officials say their investigation has shown it happened just once, last Wednesday.  They say the student admitted he put the semen into a container of ranch dressing in the  student comments' dining area.  And officials have determined that the contents could have been ingested during the last lunch 
[01:56:00]  period on Wednesday and during all five lunch periods on Thursday.  From now on in all District 200 schools, condiments will only be available in individual packets  and in large containers, which would make them difficult to tample with.  What gave it away was people came up with a salad and he would throw the ranch dressing  on their back.  Do you know how potent you have to be for someone to taste it through ranch dressing?  No kidding.  God almighty.  Or what kind of a whore you have to be. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  With that sophisticated palate that you can eat a ton of ranch dressing.  This is Irish guy's sperm.  Yeah.  Hmm.  What is...  I don't know, but there's something about the smell I recognize.  Hey, that's dog food.  Honeymooners.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  That's wonderful.  We'll stop right there.  Good for him.  That kid's a hero.  It's like a wine tester. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I'm getting a hint of oak.  Very good viscosity.  Yeah.  Viscosity.  I'm just really showing my ignorance here.  Hey, a couple things.  A big thank you to Rosen's Restaurant and Catering, 23 East 51st Street, between 5th and Madison  for all the omelets this morning.  They did a great job.  We got Drew Boogie in studio spinning live.  When we get back, the girl that sang I Saw the Sign during the MacBook karaoke comes in  and does the song live for us.  Wait, by the way, you bunch of queers, I will be at the Borgata New Year's Eve and my  pals Opie and Anthony will just be in the room. 
[01:57:30]  They may come to the show.  I am going to be on hand at the show laughing at my pal Jimmy.  I will be there, Jimmy.  Oh, good.  Rosen chips, you're coming.  We're going to L.A. today, too.  Yeah, right after the show.  Oh, another group trip.  Whoopity effing do.  Can we stop already with the togetherness?  That's what I try to tell Kenny.  Stop trying to make it a group.  Another winged disease.  We all have separate lives.  Well, they could have gotten you a nice or sweet, but they didn't. 
[01:58:00]  All right, here we go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bearer of bad news and a smile.  He loves bad news.  Lives for it.  The girl will do I Saw the Sign live next.  This is what just happened.  That thing was crawling on my leg.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st. 
[01:59:00]  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  To be continued... 
[01:59:30]  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Drew Boogie spinning live in studio today.  Also have Bill Burr in here, Louis C.K., we got guys making omelets. 
[02:00:00]  And someone very, very famous has stepped up to the microphone.  It's Pamela.  Oh, your mic's working.  Great.  Hi.  Pamela won the MacBook karaoke contest last week, one of the days anyway, by singing I  Saw the Sign.  You know, this little...  I saw the sign.  It's a hit now.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[02:00:30]  It's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  You get into the lights where you belong.  But I miss you, you belong.  Everyone's thinking it.  You don't look like you sound.  All right.  We expected someone else to come walking through that door.  I don't know.  You're lovely.  Yeah, you're lovely.  This has also served as an impromptu dating service, because all of your listeners found  me on MySpace, and they were like, I want to sing a duet with you, baby.  Oh.  Yeah, it's kind of crazy. 
[02:01:00]  I want to sing a duet with you, baby.  Baby.  You sure it wasn't said like that?  Probably.  Maybe we could go to F.H. Riley's parking lot.  Me and you.  No one said that, actually.  I don't doubt it.  Well, that's my brother's fine restaurant, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington  Village.  Yes.  Stop by and say hi to Brett.  But, yeah.  And the F.H. doesn't stand for blank here.  Right.  Yes, of course.  Are you a single girl?  I am.  Nice.  Yeah.  Girl or girl?  It sounded like you said, are you a single girl? 
[02:01:30]  No, are you a single girl?  Oh, I didn't hear that.  No, not are you a single girl.  No, no, I'm not in Mars Day.  Are you a single girl?  And you're from Deer Park, I guess?  Deer Park.  Deer Park, Long Island.  Yeah.  That was the biggest surprise when I heard you were from Long Island.  Yeah, I'm sure.  After hearing, oh, I swore on the swine.  Yeah.  Kind of family.  Kind of rich.  Kind of middle class, average.  Got a dog, a brother, a parent.  Deer Park's a weird area.  Could go either way.  Yeah.  Could go either way there, yes.  Me too.  You get down there by a little closer to Wine Dance, there's a problem. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  It's kind of, you know.  Then you get near kind of Dix Hills-ish area.  Kind of nice.  You fall in the middle.  Exactly.  All right.  Very nice.  You're a lovely girl.  Thank you.  Do you need some water or something for your vocals?  I just, you know, hydrated my vocal cords.  Hydrated.  She's a pro.  I'm already.  What a pro.  I know what to do, yeah.  You know what to do.  I just want to say that this song is for all the little girls that are like eight years  old right now that did not get the solo in the holiday Christmas concert and are in  the bathroom about to slip their wrists. 
[02:02:30]  I was there and I know what it's like, so I think good things could happen.  So is Jimmy.  Do you sing?  I was there, too.  Going, psst, before you do that.  When they said no, I would root them.  Go ahead.  Cut your wrists.  Worthless.  Do you sing karaoke a lot?  I do.  You go to karaoke bars?  Sometimes, yeah.  I just turned 21, so now I can legally, you know, go out.  Look at that.  Now you can legally kiss Miss Teen USA.  Right.  There you go.  Trump might have a problem.  It's kind of too slutty for me.  And you go to school in Buffalo?  Because we're being heard in Buffalo right now.  Yep.  I do.  University of Buffalo.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:03:00]  Yep.  Very cool.  All right.  Do you want to sing I Swore the Sign?  I think I'm ready.  It's got to be the hit.  It needs to, like, stretch out a little bit.  Prepare.  It's got to be the hit.  No one wants to hear the B-side.  I hate when you go to a concert, especially if, like, the opening act is a one-hit wonder.  Right.  And they don't play their hit until the end.  All right.  Get it over with and then leave.  I see Metallica, for God's sake.  All right.  Here we go.  Pamela from Deer Park singing I Swore the Swoin.  Let's get into it. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, baby.  This stinks.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I, I got a new life

[02:04:30]  And it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  No one's gonna drag you up  To get into the light  Where you belong  But where do you belong?  Oh yeah  Jimmy, this is for you  Ah, I'm singing it  Under the clean moon  For so many years  I've wondered who you are  How could a person like you  Bring me the

Riley's  In January or early February 
[02:07:00]  You come down and do it live  I'll clear my schedule  Yeah  Halfway through that  Louis C.K. came over  And said  Take off your headphones  It is ten times funnier  Without the music  So I took it off  I heard not a stitch of music  All you could hear was her vocals  And it is classic  It's beautiful  Is there  You hear her breathing between  Yeah, everything  It's so good  All the nuances without music  Are phenomenal  With that said  Where's Tim?  Is there any way she could hear  The music in the headphones 
[02:07:30]  But it doesn't go over the air  So we could just isolate her voice  Yeah  So the rest of the country  Can hear that  I hope that was  I'm sure that's doable  We're able to separate it  Oh, yeah  The Linda McCartney's cut  We need  It's  You know what?  I really love it, though  Because she's so sincere  Like, she's really  Yeah, she's getting into it  Totally  I really feel it  It comes in the heart  Is that one of your favorites?  It feels like  It's a very generous performance  I mean that  Is that one of your favorites?  It's all right  I've had requests to do other songs 
[02:08:00]  From, like, the MySpace stalkers  What's your favorite song to do?  The other night I did  You Ought to Know  By Alanis Morissette  Wow  That was pretty intense  Do we have that?  Love to hear that  Wow  Could you sing it a cappella?  Kind of, probably  Okay, let's hear it  I want you to know  I'm happy for you  I wish nothing but  The best for you both

[02:26:30]  Thank you. 
[02:27:00]  You're on the road.  Where are you?  Over here?  There you go.  Drew Boogie spinning live in studio today.  Doing a great job for us.  Yes, he is.  Thank you, Drew.  Scratching away.  Scratching his ass off today.  They were very musical people.  I got to get the... 
[02:27:30]  That was kind of cool.  That was kind of cool.  That was definitely kind of cool.  Hey, let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey there, Rob.  How are you doing, guys?  Welcome aboard.  Yeah, I have to comment on Pamela's karaoke.  I think the first one that she sent in really was genuine because she was trying to be good.  But this one that she didn't see you today, I think she was just basically doing a parody of herself.  You know, she was overly... 
[02:28:00]  There's always a party pooper out there.  There's always a party pooper.  Everyone else is saying how hilarious it was, but you have to rain on everyone's parade.  It was hilarious.  I just think she was trying to be horrible.  You know what, you are, sir?  You're a parade rainer.  Am I wrong?  You don't think that she was trying to be horrible?  I don't think so.  I looked at her eyes and she was singing that she wanted you to know that she saw the sign.  I think she was trying to sing her little heart out and you're stomping on it now, sir.  There was no wink at the end. 
[02:28:30]  Isn't that how Maddie got?  What did he say?  He gave her francas.  Oh, the diva francas.  So, he's a good egg.  That's anger.  No, she...  He got all mad.  She was feeling it because she was live in front of a bunch of people, so she gave it that extra oomph.  And that meant it was extra horrible.  She was gyrating.  She had her eyes closed.  Yeah.  She did a little dance.  Put her hands up in the air.  Oh, she was totally into it.  That's why I love my Pammy.  She dances.  She saw the sign.  My baby's out here, too.  Of course she is here.  Wherever I go, she goes.  Our live studio audience.  That's what it is with my Pammy. 
[02:29:00]  Let's go to Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Jeff, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Thanks for calling, Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Hey, I just want to let you know, you guys should have really kicked Andrew in the crotch when you were walking over.  I can't even...  I can't even...  I can't even tell you how annoyed I was to see him today.  I know he's homeless and all that crap, but we told him for a month straight every time we saw him.  People told him for his whole life to get a job in a house.  He's not homeless because he's a prompt guy who goes after the brass ring. 
[02:29:30]  Hence the frustration.  You're right.  I have with him more than anger with him.  He sees a brass ring and he sits on it and shits.  Because he...  It was a great event, guys.  Our job is to build up these guys.  So many people were looking forward to meeting him because we spent the time making him into something for a radio show.  He was the Led Zeppelin.  Right.  And we ended up with...  With Winger.  A couple of zebras.  Fucking Winger.  I'll tell you one thing.  It was kind of our fault.  We should have had a guy there around between 8.30.  We should have had a guy there.  We should have anticipated that this dumb bum... 
[02:30:00]  He's like Axl Rose, man.  You got to go get him.  We should have had a guy with him all week.  We can't blame the staff.  Staying with him.  No, no, no.  Those guys were looking for him so early in the morning.  Killed him.  So fucking early.  At least tag him.  What's up?  Were they looking at him for like 11.30?  A radio caller.  I can't believe you guys are amazed that a homeless guy...  I know.  Didn't show up.  He said he would be moved.  Dude, but we even...  That fucker wasn't prompt.  We even knew that he was irresponsible, obviously.  So that's why we kept pounding him with the info.  Write it down. 
[02:30:30]  Scared the shit out of him.  We'll come here early.  Yep.  We told him to allot for daylight savings time.  Oh, God.  I'm sure there's some CEO somewhere going,  What happened to that guy?  I gave him every shot.  Yeah.  Just could never make it in.  I promoted him.  That's right.  He had all the talent in the world.  He just pissed it away.  The guy wouldn't show up.  Pissed it directly into his own mouth.  And literally.  Came into a board meeting and pissed in his own mouth.  I think there's a dentist still waiting for him to show up for an appointment he made in 83.  His fucking teeth. 
[02:31:00]  Next time we see him, we should give him $100 per tooth he can just pull out of his mouth.  I guarantee if you squeed his stomach hard enough, teeth will fall out.  Dude, those things are just barely hanging on, man.  I don't know.  That mic's not working.  I have no idea why that mic's not working.  What?  Billy Burr's Mac is working?  That's a great test.  Test one, two.  Test thing.  There you go.  That's a wireless.  That was just a grave injustice.  Let's go to Jim in Philly.  Jim, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I wanted to comment on that girl. 
[02:31:30]  I thought that girl was fucking golden, dude.  It sounded like somebody was choking a llama.  And when it went to breathe again, they choked it again.  My brother texted me during that, the owner of F.A. Pryley's, by the way, in Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  And he said that she sounds like the chick from Porky's.  I don't remember that girl.  Geez, I don't remember Porky's.  You don't remember Porky's?  I mean, I remember the movie in the shower scene.  Oh, the girl who would make all the noise.  Yeah, yeah.  He had to put the sock in her mouth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That was, what's her name brought there from Sex and the City? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, uh.  The one, huh?  Samantha.  Julia Louise Dreyfuss.  You know, speaking of seeing the sign.  Right.  I forgot we used to do that bit.  Yeah, remember my bit?  I used to do it.  Easy.  It's my only bit of the year.  Blueberry.  Speaking of easy, I never get it easy in the ass.  Ernie Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I tell you what, I'd rather watch the Bills lose to the Giants over and over again than listen to that again.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:30]  You know what?  You're such a liar, man.  We could give her an hour on this show just doing karaoke every single person.  You'd never turn it off.  No one would turn it off.  I think people need to see the video.  People need to see the video to see the commitment.  No.  The emotion.  Yeah.  You know.  She's a human spirit.  She's a lovely girl.  I listened to her.  I'm a fan.  I mean, I listened to her.  I heard you guys on some replay in L.A., and I had it in my head.  Yeah, I got stuck in that.  And not the song.  Her version.  Yeah, her version.  Soin.  Soin. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, that was stuck in my head.  You couldn't just blurt it out every so often.  No.  You couldn't just leave it in your head.  You'd have to actually say it so you could hear it.  Totally.  Soin.  Soin.  She's a wonderful.  All the pop and the P's and all of it stuck in my head.  And enunciating every word.  Yeah, she's enunciating her ass off to that.  Letting yourself go ahead and have the accent for part of it.  Right.  But then trying to be the Queen of England for another part.  Which is understand.  Hey, Pamela made the dump report. 
[02:33:30]  She made the dump report.  Who?  Pamela.  Oh, she did?  Yeah, go down on you in a theater.  Oh, I didn't think they would play that.  They bleep it out and they actually play the Atlantis version.  We had a real clean show until Louis C.K. showed up.  Sorry, guys.  You know, Louis is a real clean mouth.  We love it.  The XMers are loving it.  801, diarrhea in my mouth, Louis C.K.  Yeah, that's a clinical term.  803, blowing air up his ass, Louis C.K.  818, I had a boner. 
[02:34:00]  I knew they weren't going to allow that.  A boner?  Boner?  That whole boner story, they were dumping like crazy.  How could they dump boner?  Because they're fucking stupid.  Boner's a silly word.  Exactly.  It could mean a mistake.  818, my boner was sticking out in the fourth grade.  That got dumped.  822, millions of sperm have been spilled because of her.  Discussing Britney Spears' vagina, which was very funny, by the way, Louis C.K.  822, teenage boys masturbating to her face and stomach.  826, brutal sex with her from the front and back, Norton, during discussion of Miss Teen USA. 
[02:34:30]  I think brutal is what got that beep.  No, it's N-back.  Yeah, and this is so obviously the line of the day, and they didn't even hear it on the regular radio stations.  828, marble white vagina lips, just bloodied.  Louis C.K.  Can't describe the vagina.  Really?  You could say vagina, no description.  Wow.  What if a vagina fucking steals your wallet, and you're trying to tell the police over the radio?  You could say black vagina. 
[02:35:00]  But that is a description.  So when you lose your wallet, it's called NAACP.  Hey, I didn't want my wallet back.  Anybody?  All right.  Norton tasted through ranch dressing, got dumped.  What?  But the kid's the one who jerked off.  And I even said, do you know how potent you have to be?  I didn't even say semen.  Oh, my baby.  He said, discussion, high school student spiking salad with semen, left the entire news story, but took this out.  So they allowed the whole news story except that one line from Norton. 
[02:35:30]  In the context of the news story, when you say taste it through ranch dressing, tasting it, they know what it is.  So Jim Norton is the one who brought home the idea that folks were eating that kids come.  Right.  Yes.  Wow.  Before that, who knows what they were talking about.  Oh, no.  That's, yeah, the FCC is just ridiculous.  It's all very mysterious and in that gray area.  And unfortunately for Louis C.K. at 8.30, mmm, Irish guy sperm.  Got dumped out.  Jeez.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:36:00]  Isn't regular radio just a pitch?  I'd love to test the FCC by, like, you know, opening a center for cancer research  and calling it the cunt face cancer center and then during cancer.  Yeah, just plugging it on a radio show.  Yeah, or just curing all cancer of women and calling it cunt fixer.  And like, all right, if you're offended, stay home and die.  Support cunt fixer.  Yeah, you don't support cancer research.  Fucking cunt. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Kelly in Oregon.  Kelly, what's up?  Cunt fixer.  Everybody that's saying that she was trying too hard and that she wasn't funny,  they're all full of shit because they sat there and listened to it.  I had to pull it over.  I was laughing so hard.  I was crying.  The important thing is you have a name that's also popular for a girl.  Yeah.  That is.  Hey, you can't win them all.  My father hated me.  And by the way, is the gang working on an encore for Pamela?  She followed us over here, Tex-Am.  She should do one more for us.  She heard I had a rod.  What about her favorite? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Can we get her her favorite?  A request or something.  Is that possible?  Who's working today?  Maybe we can find out.  So Melanis was her favorite of hers.  Can we get that song for her, possibly, or find out if we can?  Well, that may not be the karaoke version, but we'll get something up for her.  All right.  Is that the song you want to sing or something else?  I'm good.  Hey, get Pamela in here.  Oh, yeah.  Get your hair out of my head.  Here comes Pamela again. 
[02:37:30]  I saw the swine.  I saw the swine.  You're getting a lot of requests.  We need an encore.  What song could you sing?  Does anyone have any specific song requests?  I could try and...  Well, which ones do you like?  Give us a list of ones you like, and then maybe one will hit us nice.  There's got to be some with passion.  I like Spice Girls.  I like Alanis Morissette.  Oh, Spice Girls.  Needs a little bit of harmony, though.  I don't know.  I pretty much know the words to...  Alanis Morissette could be really funny, because that's, you know...  Can you do Wind Beneath My Wings? 
[02:38:00]  Not a fan.  Sorry.  Good try.  All right.  Let's try to find that Alanis Morissette song.  How about nothing compares to you?  Bill, you ought to know...  Actually, no, we could do.  You ought to know.  We'll do it the way we did it over there, so it doesn't matter if it's the actual song.  She could just sing along to the song.  Is that cool enough?  That's perfect.  All right.  Let's do that.  Nice.  All right.  Find that song, and we'll do it that way.  Burn it to disc, so then we can plug her into...  Oh, no.  I don't know if we can do the same thing we did over there.  I need to decode.  It's different over here.  You certainly do need to decode.  You're a chesty gal. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  What is this?  You're a lovely chesty gal.  We've never even used this before.  What is it?  I don't know.  Is this...  What is this?  Why do we have no seat for our guest?  Wow.  What is that?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get an encore from Pamela after the break, okay?  Let's do that.  All right.  In the meantime, we've got Louis C.K. in studio.  We've got Bill Burr in studio.  Bill Burr, West Palm Beach for New Year's.  Yeah.  Louis C.K. on HBO and Caroline's January 4th through the 7th. 
[02:39:00]  Through the 7th.  My special, Shameless, airs on HBO January 13th.  That is really, really cool.  All right.  Drew Boogie, get us out of here for just a bit.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:39:30]  Don't fuck the underage drunk guests. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, mister, you're so tall.  Shh.  Not on the air.  Stay tuned for more pearls of wisdom from your pals at the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:40:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  pick up the phone con.  Hello?  Wow.  Nice.  Right on.  Drew Boogie in studio today.  Awesome.  That is really, really cool.  He's got a talent for that, huh? 
[02:41:00]  I would buy that.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  When are you going to have them on a disc for everybody?  I'll put it together soon.  All right.  I want to know how we got Jimmy at home.  That's actually catchy.  I could get dressed to that in the morning.  Pick up the phone con.  Pick up the phone con.  I don't know how you're in the elevator later.  Pick up the phone con.  Oh, sorry.  A few people on instant feedback.  Please, no more.  No more Pamela.  Yeah, right.  Like, you're not going to listen to her do another karaoke song.  We're thinking maybe two.  Secret Agent Man and You Ought to Know by Alanis Morissette.  Like, you have the power to stop us. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, like you program the show.  Yeah, right?  Get out of here.  This is how you program the show.  You can leave it on or turn it off.  You have a binary decision.  Yes or no, you tag it.  A one or a zero.  Big high to the studio audience, by the way.  A lot of familiar faces out there.  All right.  There's a story that's worth playing before we get to You Ought to Know by Alanis Morissette.  And, well, Pamela's going to sing that.  It's a wrestling story.  Oh, so that means it's gay.  Well, absolutely.  It was a bunch of dudes. 
[02:42:00]  I didn't hear the story, but I guess it happened Friday.  Actually, Tim, why don't you explain?  Because he told me, but I'm going to mess it up.  Apparently, this high school male wrestler likes to show a move to his teammates.  And some of them don't care for it.  The move has a very suggestive title.  Suggestive.  But they're accusing this one guy of raping another guy, basically.  Well, is it in the sound clip?  He raped 18?  He raped 18 guys.  Yeah.  Tough guy.  Wow.  Champion wrestler Jerome Hunt's lawyer says all but two of the incidents reported happened in the Parker High School wrestling room before practice during last year's wrestling season. 
[02:42:30]  Hunt told investigators the accusations probably come from a wrestling move called a butt drag or skinning, which involves the wrestler placing pressure on the area of the rectum.  Hunt's assistant coach told investigators, quote, it's not something illegal or not taught.  It's being taught all over.  One accuser even testified to the grand jury, quote, I didn't take it as a sexual move.  I took it as him messing around.  But the criminal complaint states that Hunt accomplished an act of sexual penetration. 
[02:43:00]  That implies penetration, even if it happened with Hunt's fingers through the other boys' wrestling uniforms, could be considered rape.  Hunt denies penetration.  His lawyer writes that the claims against Hunt are, quote, grossly distorted and exaggerated.  And he thinks the matter should be handled in juvenile court.  Oh, that's rape?  The next thing they're going to say is that if you fucking kill a woman and fuck her mouth, that's rape. 
[02:43:30]  Jesus.  Where are they going to draw the line?  This is a slippery slope.  It's all semantics.  The butt drag?  It's called the butt drag.  And you actually grab the guy's asshole and maybe shove a thumb in there, pick him up and pull him in towards a choke move.  I've seen that.  Once you have a thumb or a finger up your ass.  Time to clean the come up.  Time to call the match. 
[02:44:00]  Time to get the janitor out.  It is truly a match over.  Get a gold medal doing that.  Picture in June with those wrestling things that come to your ears.  The wrestling things that look like headphones, yeah.  Coming all over the mat.  You come right through your old school thigh-high Roman Greco wrestling suit.  And they see a big semen stain that everybody knows what just happened.  You made a cumsy.  The butt drag.  You made a cumsy.  The butt drag followed by the nut explosion. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Nice dribble.  That would be the two-point reversal.  When the other guy gets grossed out.  Yeah, he's got his finger in your ass and you gross him out.  Yeah, because you're on your stomach just humping the match while his thumb is logged in your asshole.  And he's trying to pull it out but it's caught in a piece of skin.  Oh, my God.  You don't even move.  You don't even try to defend yourself.  You just turn around and look over your shoulder at him before the match starts.  A little tear in your eye.  Smack your butt cheek. 
[02:45:00]  That would be hilarious.  You throw your arms and legs out like you're going to make a snow angel and you just let him do what he wants.  Fuck, he's going to take your asshole with his thumbnail.  Someone is actually going to...  Like say, is that all you got?  Someone's going to actually explain the butt drag.  Unless it's Sam.  Fuck it, Sam.  Sam.  Well, Than Sam.  Sam.  You know, they are a team.  Aaron, Oklahoma, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  In wrestling, the butt drag is where a guy shoots in to get your legs and you put one arm against his face, call it cross face, 
[02:45:30]  and then you jam your fingers in between his crack and then pull him away.  That way he's off of your legs.  Yeah.  It's a delicious move.  You'd love it.  Yeah.  Delicious move.  So you have done...  You've done the butt drag?  I absolutely have done the butt drag and I'll be in New York City this week if Jimmy wants me to do it to him.  I will.  I'd like you to do the butt drag, but do it with my mouth.  Grab my mouth and just show me how you grab the asshole of another fucking braces wearing high school boy. 
[02:46:00]  Show me with your mouth.  Jesus.  All right.  High school sports are all gay, pretty much.  I wanted to play football and a friend of mine went out for the team and they said you had to, you know, the initiation rites,  you had to jerk off in the shower in front of all the other guys.  They tape your asshole shut with duct tape.  You have to spread your cheeks.  And I was like, well, I'm not going to play football because I'm not gay.  It's just you're gay.  What's all that gay?  Yeah, the gay stuff. 
[02:46:30]  What just happened, you know, a few years ago at the football camp?  Oh, with the...  They're shoving pine cones up the...  That's what it all is.  And then like in the stuff like in the grave when they're having the Iraqis jack off in their face and stuff and like pointing their penises.  And like, you know, George Bush and those guys that belong to that skull and bones thing.  They're all fucking shoving their noses up each other's asses and...  Yeah.  That's what we...  That's what makes...  That's like American greatness is built on like sexual fucking homo...  This weird...  Humiliation. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, my high school...  Humiliating.  My high school, they made these kids do like this race.  You had to hold a cheese ball between your ass cheeks.  Yeah.  Run over, drop it into a Dixie cup.  And these kids are telling me this shit.  And it's just like, okay.  Can you believe someone would have anyone do that?  Won't be playing football.  That's just not how you do that.  Fraternities were the same thing.  That's right.  That was all fraternities.  Yeah.  And you hit the people.  Oh, yeah.  And then we shoved a, you know, a fucking cucumber up his ass.  Yeah.  You want a pledge?  Or a marshmallow.  Yeah.  Well, cucumber would be gay.  Marshmallows.  Totally acceptable. 
[02:47:30]  Wow.  Hey, man.  I was 18.  I wanted to drink some beers at the sorority.  Because a marshmallow is like a soft dick.  Like, there's nothing gay about that.  Nothing gay.  If your friend's soft, I'd let somebody fuck me up the ass when they're soft.  If they're hard, that's fucking queer.  But shove your soft dick up my ass anytime.  It's like, I'll wipe my ass with your soft dick.  I don't care.  Look, I was seven hours away from home.  I was just trying to get some new friends in college.  I mean. 
[02:48:00]  Did somebody shove the soft marshmallow up your ass?  No, no.  No one.  No, no.  No one did the inserting.  They had to pick a marshmallow up.  I inserted my own marshmallow.  With their ass cheeks.  Yeah.  And then drop it like, pilot to Bombadier.  Pilot to Bombadier.  They had to hit a mock model of the competing frat house that was on the floor.  We were bombing the frat house.  So they went on a bombing run.  Where every aircraft was the Enola Gay.  I had to waddle across the floor and find the other frat house.  That's great. 
[02:48:30]  That's really gay.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Mitch and Jerry.  The Enola Gay lifts off from the tarmac.  A deadly cargo in her belly.  Hey, let's move on.  Mitch in Jersey.  With your teenage boyish undershorts.  Keep the show moving.  Joe Kennedy Jr. died in age.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was a wrestler in high school, and they asked what we taught, but we called it checking  the oil instead of the butt dragging.  Checking the oil.  Well, this guy.  It's the only way to get a guy from stopping doing whatever he's doing and stuffing his thumb 
[02:49:00]  up his ass.  Wrestling is gay.  Why don't you just tap out?  It just looks.  And professional wrestling, like WWE and stuff, looks gay enough.  Burly guys hugging each other and grabbing each other, putting their heads by their dicks  and then slamming them on the mat and everything.  But yeah, Jimmy.  But regular, legitimate wrestling could be the gayest sport ever, ever.  They're grabbing each other everywhere.  And then I would see like a move in high school or junior high when they would try to get 
[02:49:30]  like regular gym class to learn how to wrestle.  And there was that move where a guy would just grab your fucking balls.  Yeah.  And I'm out.  Yeah.  The second a guy's grabbing my nuts, first of all, it hurts.  Yeah.  Second of all, it's a guy.  I showed up to gym that day.  Every girl does it, you'll take the pain.  Yeah.  Just because it's a girl doing it.  I showed up to gym that day in a snowsuit.  Uh, is that it?  Yeah.  Big.  Yeah, I don't think there's anything.  Because the wrestling uniforms are just horrific.  Skin tight.  Your fucking ball and dick is showing. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think there's anything.  There's nothing wrong with it, but they should acknowledge it.  They should just call it gay fuck or whatever.  Gay fuck.  I mean, two men trying to fuck each other.  You know, then these guys go out and beat up people they think are faggots after they  feel each other up.  You guys have to go with the pain.  We should just acknowledge that a lot of guys want to suck each other off.  You want to have, yeah, some type of sex.  Well, like sex education, they should teach gay sex in school also, along with just like 
[02:50:30]  a normal, natural occurrence.  Yeah.  Or don't stick your finger up a wrestler's asshole.  Wrestling, though, really is a competition of two guys raping each other.  Yeah.  Like, and the one guy will pin the guy, and he wins the rape.  No, no, no.  Whoever got pinned is the winner.  It's co-rape.  What's that?  Whoever got pinned is the winner.  Yeah.  It all depends on what side of the fence you're at.  Quite literally.  It's like two-way rape.  Let's go to Max and Dallas.  They're fighting.  There's a struggle. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And then the other guy has to be in that submissive position where you can then fuck him.  That's right.  And they just kind of cut out the fucking part.  Like soft porn.  Yeah, it's soft porn.  It's hotel porn.  Yes.  What was the wrestling is hotel porn.  Exactly.  The rape is just outside the screen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  What was hotter than when Greg the Hammer Valentine would put that figure four leg lock  on a boy and straighten him out?  Yeah.  Nothing.  I don't think anything was.  Nothing.  Hey, uh, you only think Gary the wrestling is teaching wrestling.  That has to be. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  A wrestling coach.  Just put your face right in his asshole.  Good move.  Good move, son.  Blowing that whistle.  Let me show you how it's done.  Middle-aged gentleman.  Uh, Max in Dallas.  What's up?  Good morning, boy.  Hey, Max.  I guess, Opie, you're the first person that's ever played Chubby Bunny with your asshole.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, can we get Pamela in here, please?  Oh.  Why?  This conversation was getting really sexy.  Where is Pamela?  Is she ready for her encore? 
[02:52:00]  She's right out there.  As Jimmy said, busty gal.  Chesty.  You are Chesty.  Is that a basic?  Oh, no.  Which phone is that?  Not at all.  Oh, Louis C.K.  Oh.  You're a lovely girl, Pamela.  Pamela.  Billy Burr?  No, no.  Is your mic on finally?  Hi.  Oh, there it is.  Good?  That's good.  Yes, baby.  So, and she needs headphones?  I do.  Well, she's got it here.  I do.  I do.  I'm a professional. 
[02:52:30]  I do.  I need a mic.  Yeah, mine too.  More things along.  All right.  What's going to happen here is Pamela's going to do an encore.  She's going to do an Alanis Morissette.  You ought to know.  But we're doing a fantastic song.  We're doing it our way.  You don't get to hear the music.  You just get to hear Pamela.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  She'll hear the music.  She'll hear the music.  She'll sing to it.  Yeah, but you, the listener, you just get the isolated Pamela voice.  The song's kind of dirty.  Is that okay?  Yeah.  We're on XM.  This fucking station, we could do anything we want.  See, I just proved it by dropping you off. 
[02:53:00]  I'm a nice girl, though.  I don't usually, you know.  That's okay.  Okay.  It's dirty.  It's a song.  It's art.  Yeah, it's a performance.  Yeah.  Make sure her volume, you know, is up pretty good because when you sing, if the band's volume  is a little low, you won't give it your all.  Right.  You know, so this is Pamela.  I saw the sign from Deer Park doing Alanis Morissette.  Yes.  You ought to know.  Here we go.  I'm ready.  I want you to know that I'm happy for you. 
[02:53:30]  I wish nothing but the best for you both.  An older version of me.  Is she perverted like me?  Would she go down on you in a theater?  Does she speak eloquently?  And would she have your baby?  I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.  Because the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. 
[02:54:00]  No.  And every time you speak her name, does she know how you told me you'd hold me?  Until you die, until you die, until you die, while you're still alive.  And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away.  It's not fair to deny me. 
[02:54:30]  Hold the cross high there that you gave to me.  You, you, you ought to know.  You seem very well.  Things look peaceful.  I'm not quite as well.  I thought you should know.  Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity? 
[02:55:00]  I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.  It was a slap in the face.  How quickly I was replaced.  Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?  Because the love that we gave, that we made, wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide.  No.  And every time you speak her name, does she know how you told me you'd hold me?  Until you die, until you die, while you're still alive. 
[02:55:30]  And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away.  It's not fair to deny me of the cross high there that you gave to me.  You, you, you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, no. 
[02:56:30]  Because the joke that you gave is laid on the bed.  It's not going to fade as soon as you close your eyes.  And you know it.  And every time you scratch my nails and someone else is back, I hope you feel it.  Well, can you feel it?  And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left.  When you went away, when you went away, it's not fair to deny me. 
[02:57:00]  All the cross high there that you gave to me.  You, you, you, you, you, I don't know.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's not fair to deny me of the cross high there that you gave to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know. 
[02:57:30]  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  That was really intense.  I really can't even like me right now.  I can't handle it.  You're getting some applause from the gallery today.  Oh, guys.  Was the music playing over XM?  No.  Was it on the headphones?  No.  It might have been bleeding through the headphones a little bit.  But now the Palsark people are saying, no, they couldn't hear the music.  Very good.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that was interesting. 
[02:58:00]  Very inspired.  Wonderful.  Thank you, Pamela.  I really just like went to another place.  People are requesting one more.  Let's say hi to Mooney in Texas.  Mooney.  Hold on, boys.  I think I got a cat under the hood.  I got a kind of racket coming out from underneath.  Well, anyways, I want to hear Kenny and Pamela do a duet of Secret Agent Man.  Can we work that out?  Is Kenny still here?  He's right behind you.  You want to do a duet?  Yeah.  Is he as good as me, though?  I don't know.  Throw a match back there. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, boys.  Yeah.  That wrestling, don't they call it Australian Rules Wrestling?  Where you need to boo-foo your partner or competitor?  Who the hell knows?  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to do one more.  Pamela, go hang out.  We're going to do Secret Agent Man with Pamela and Kenny before we leave today.  That was terrific.  We leave it early today?  That was good.  Huh?  Maybe 10.05.  That was like the mating call of an animal. 
[02:59:00]  I don't know why your mic would come out of the woods and say, why would his mic be on?  Oh, I heard it.  Are you hearing?  Are you hearing?  Are you hearing his mic?  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, it's just low.  I don't want to hear him anymore.  I hear everyone's mic.  How about mine?  What about now?  All right, yeah.  Is that my fault?  By the way, Jimmy, the great almond controversy has been solved.  An informant told me, and I'm willing to rat him out, that Black Earl has been stealing 
[02:59:30]  your almonds and eating them by the fistful.  Black Earl can do whatever Black Earl wants, as he took the photo of me with Sabbath.  Black Earl has carte blanche in my life.  Immunity.  Whatever he wants, he gets.  I buy a mamans if he wants them.  Just thought I'd rat out a black man.  Stop calling him Black Earl.  He might like that.  No, he likes to be called Black Earl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's because he wears black clothes every day.  Yep.  Every day of his life.  You should have seen when I called him when his name was Jim.  I was watching a documentary about that, the nigger Jim thing. 
[03:00:00]  Which book is it?  Huck Finn?  Huck Finn.  And how Ronald Reagan was going to give an award.  Yes.  And they told him, you're not supposed to say nigger Jim.  Like, it's not okay for the president to say, well, for an award, it's fine.  And I'd like to point out nigger Jim as a wonderful piece of literature.  Where's nigger Jim?  Let's bring him up. 
[03:00:30]  Well, mommy.  And he looks at Baker.  Yeah, he does.  Like, you see him go, he had done wonderful stories of Huck Finn and his friend Jim.  There's a pause where he went, oh, wait a minute, I'm not supposed to.  His friend, nice guy Jim.  Ninny Jim.  Ninny.  What did they change his name to, Huck Finn?  They never changed.  They just took the book out, I think, in schools for a while.  It gets pulled off the shelves occasionally. 
[03:01:00]  The African-American James.  That's right.  Right.  Be nice, politically correct.  That's the way that'll work.  Absolutely.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, it's Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  What are you highlighting parts?  Well, Kenny's just going to do the chorus.  I think that's how it's going to work.  Oh, okay.  Pamela will do, Kenny will do the Huck, whatever.  I'd love to hear some harmonizing.  I bet it would be beautiful.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  We'll try to work the song so it'll work for Pamela and Kenny, and then we'll put that 
[03:01:30]  bit to bed, to grave, to grave.  In the meantime, it's Drew Boogie live in studio, scratching away for us.  Drew, take it.  We'll be right back. 
[03:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot.  That fucking thing's elegant.  Right on my fucking foot.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking foot. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, that's all right.  Yeah, Drew Boogie live in studio today.  Jimmy is so conducive to those things.  Your fucking quotes are so great to just cut up like that.  I didn't even see it.  My fucking foot.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He was asleep.  I fell asleep, man.  I'm fucking...  I've been up to the stage today. 
[03:04:00]  Dude, we are...  Let me tell you what we are as a show.  Completely ready for vacation.  We're Mabel King-ing to the finish line.  She was the mother from What's Happening.  Foot raised between Mabel King and Jean Jean the Dancing Machine in the last year of his life.  Well, you don't know Mabel King?  She played Roger's mother on What's Happening.  Oh, right.  And she died...  She had her legs cut off due to diabetes.  Really?  As did Jean Jean the Dancing Machine.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah.  An ironic twist of... 
[03:04:30]  They both had her legs cut off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Five minutes apart.  All that grape soda.  That's a shame.  Let's say hi to...  I guess there's some controversy still over that party on Saturday.  Mafia Life, Chris wants in.  All right.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, sweetie.  It was great seeing you at the party, man.  Hey.  Yeah, there was a big Ron and Fez Christmas party on Saturday.  We all went and had a great time.  Oh, cool.  I opened a door, though, and saw a man blowing a guy in a bunny suit.  Wow. 
[03:05:00]  Hell of a party.  Great party.  Yes.  The place is fucking packed, man.  You know?  Real quick, if you don't mind, I'm sorry to bring the show down if I do, but fucking...  What's going to bring the show down?  I just want to say that it was pretty fucked up about Master Paul put his hands on French  bread pizza.  He's trying to get past that line to go say hello to Ronnie.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  He must have buckled under pressure or something, but he's like grabbing him, making the girl  cry. 
[03:05:30]  You know?  I just want to...  What happened?  Fuck you.  What are you talking about?  This is so important.  Wait, what happened?  Mafia Life, Chris, that he had to do it on the Ron and Fez show yesterday, and then a  little recap on today's show.  So, apparently, there was some confusion as to if there was and where there was a VIP  section at the Ron and Fez.net party.  And there was a small VIP section, and then a bigger section that wasn't VIP.  I was sitting in the non-VIP section, but a lot of people thought it was a VIP section. 
[03:06:00]  Man of the people, are you?  I like that.  I love the fans.  I love the fans.  I wanted to fucking punch people.  Because here's the dilemma with that.  Being in a section that was perceived as a VIP section, but not really, kept the normal  people out, because they thought it was VIP.  But the drunks didn't care.  They'll just stagger right up.  So you're limiting yourself to only talking to drunken, babbling people who, if you don't  keep eye contact and listen to every babbling, fucking spit-filled word that they're saying, 
[03:06:30]  you're the fucking asshole.  Did anyone babble at you?  Everyone babbled at me.  And then there was a guy next to me with a joint hanging out of his mouth, yelling at  Eastside Dave, fuck you, fuck you.  And then he turns to me to have a conversation about how long he's been listening and how  the show was better back at N.E.W. and things like that.  So I was just like, and then I saw there's like two knives on the table. 
[03:07:00]  So I was like, you know, Poe was standing right there.  I was like, Poe, could you maybe just get those knives off the table or something?  And he took them off the table.  And he wasn't working security that night, but there was a couple of instances where  I was just too fucking tired to either get into a fight or, you know, have a problem with  some people.  Right, right.  And if Poe's right there, I'll use him, you know, to maybe have somebody relocated to  another table.  When the guy asked, so you like the old show better, did you ask him what his jerk-off 
[03:07:30]  message board name was?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure he wouldn't have told you.  I'm sure he wasn't one of those motherfuckers.  But he was just like, he had a Band-Aid, one of those big fucking cartoon Band-Aids on  his forehead.  Like, obviously someone just popped him in the face.  He's sitting in a crowded bar with a joint in his mouth.  He was an ass.  You can't even compare the pictures when it comes down to it.  The post situation with Mafia Life Chris and Frenchie from, not Frenchie, French Bread  Pizza.  Yeah, French Bread Pizza from a Ron and Fezz's show. 
[03:08:00]  I don't know what that problem was or is or anything like that.  I wasn't involved with that.  Well, here's Poe.  Poe is here.  Here's Poe in his man in black suit.  We're going to ask Master Poe.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  That clip on Ty, what's going on here?  What's up, Poe?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are we?  Good.  Checking eye out with that Ty.  What am I talking to?  Chris from Mafia Life.  This is Chris again.  Hey, Chris, how are you?  Can you put this a little louder?  So what's the beef?  What's the beef, Chris? 
[03:08:30]  With me, I don't think he should have put his hands on a girl.  That's my only problem.  And that's why he did call in for both shows because I think it's important for people  to know.  Oh, it's very important.  You can do your job and I feel he buckled under pressure.  Now, I'll be a character witness here because I did not see the instance that you are talking  about.  But I have seen on many occasions Poe in situations with crowds.  I have never seen him grab anybody.  What I see Poe do is he'll stick his arm out and kind of try to part people and maybe even 
[03:09:00]  give a little nudge, not a push or anything, but just kind of, hey, there's someone coming  through here kind of a thing.  I've never seen him grab anyone, especially not a woman.  Well, we saw him grab one person and that was fun.  It was fun to watch.  Me too.  I've never seen him do it.  He's always top notch.  He's always been a gentleman.  I don't know.  Now, again, I didn't see the situation, so I could be talking to my ass. 
[03:09:30]  Maybe Poe popped him in the face.  I don't know.  It really surprised me.  Well, people are turning on you, Chris, because you brought it up two days in a row.  Didn't you make your point yesterday?  That's what people say.  People are turning on you.  The feedback is not pretty.  I thought it should be known.  Well, the feedback's not pretty for you right now because they're like, didn't he make his  point yesterday?  Well, did Poe respond yesterday?  They're starting to call you get a life, Chris.  Get a life.  Mafia life, Chris.  Get a life, Chris.  I mean, what kind of touchy-feely was it?  Was it an ass grab?  Was it a brush?  What's the deal?  No, no. 
[03:10:00]  His whole hand was wrapped around her wrist like it was a guy.  I wouldn't fucking push the issue if it wasn't serious.  Anybody that knows me, you know, I know she was upset, you know?  Back in the Mad Dog Show, we got Mafia Life Chris on the phone.  What's your question, Chris?  Well, Poe seemed to, uh, no, Mr. Poe, I've never seen him do anything like that there,  Mikey.  What do you think?  Are you this upset, Chris?  She's your chick or what?  Yeah, she's my girlfriend.  I feel upset.  I got to say so.  I could see that. 
[03:10:30]  I could see a man standing up for his girl like that.  She's your girlfriend?  He should have done it there when Poe was there.  Why didn't you say that from the beginning?  He should have called it in the radio station like some kind of thing.  Why didn't you say that in the beginning?  I don't know, because then maybe people wouldn't turn on you if you stated that from the beginning  there.  My apologies, you know.  I'm a little nervous being on air in the first place.  Why, you should be a seasoned veteran from yesterday's show.  The party was awesome, really, and, uh... 
[03:11:00]  All right, anything else you want to say to Poe?  Well, Poe, what was the explanation?  Poe may have an explanation here.  All right, first of all...  After all that, Poe goes, I was trying to fuck her.  What's the fuck?  She was approaching, and I just wanted to hurt her, gentlemen.  I felt, gentlemen, that she needed me to insert.  Gentlemen, I thought it was F.H. Riley.  Okay, guys, you're killing me here.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I was there, I was by myself, I was taking care of a very big crowd, and 
[03:11:30]  I was requested by management, um, by the one that was coordinating the Ron and Fez  party, to do certain things.  One is to clear out an area.  The vicinity.  Yeah, exactly, all right?  And I did the best I could, I was by myself.  Set up a perimeter.  Sometimes rape is a useful tool.  It will clear an area if you're raping up people in a row.  It sends a message.  And it's sometimes, you have to yank a girl's arm out by the socket to use it as a weapon.  I had to sacrifice one to keep everyone else safe. 
[03:12:00]  I know how to use the pussy lips as nunchucks.  Squeeze one titty to keep the other in line.  It seemed as though that, um, Frenchie got, you know, she was in a line of fire, because  there was a lot of people that I had to tell them to get up and move.  Victims.  And all I was doing...  Collateral damage.  Yeah.  All I was doing was trying to clear out the area, and it was very difficult.  Extreme prejudice. 
[03:12:30]  Come on, guys.  Besides the fact there was, there were some security issues that I had to take care of.  There was a guy that...  Press and kick.  Friendly fire.  She was standing in front of the free grub.  Well, all right, guys.  Can I talk now?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Yeah, I guess.  All right.  Cleavage.  If I was disrespectful to Frenchie, I apologize. 
[03:13:00]  Out of order.  Once again, if I was disrespectful to Frenchie, I don't think I was.  But if I was, I apologize.  What do I do, sensei?  Well, grab that bitch body arm, and swing her around.  Throw on the floor, and slip one in her ass.  Sweep the leg. 
[03:13:30]  A ponytail's a liability.  They simply used an ass drag move on her.  All right.  One time, Mr. Miyagi fixed my leg, and I came on his knuckles.  All right.  Are you satisfied there?  Might be like, Chris, are you going to call the replay later also?  I bet you call the replay.  I'll call the fucking replay.  I bet you call the replay and ask the same fucking questions.  I'm sure there's no disrespect there, Chris. 
[03:14:00]  No.  That was really nice, man.  Thanks for taking my call.  I appreciate the apology.  Shut up.  I'll pass the message along.  I just want to know, how is she doing?  That's how she's doing.  Let's say hi to Brian in New Rochelle.  Brian, what's up?  I just wanted to defend Poe.  I think he did a great job.  I was standing next to him most of the night.  I was the guy that won the beer chugging contest in the Samsung Helix. 
[03:14:30]  And like Poe said, I think it's a, yeah, I'm a little nervous.  Sonny Ferrelli, what's up?  Hey, you know, I saw Poe put Santa Claus in a headlock at Rivoli's, the Christmas party  that the Pest had Sunday.  Did you put, did you have to subdue Santa Claus?  Poe, what's that about?  He's shaking his head.  Did he not bring you something when you were six and you finally saw him again?  Say, Nick, we have a school to settle. 
[03:15:00]  He touched me.  He touched me as a child.  It's a dish best served cold.  Well, Santa Claus wanted me to go on his lap and I didn't, I didn't want to have any of  that, so it brings back too many memories.  It's the face or nowhere.  Tell the old St. Nick to kick his ass.  So you put him in a headlock?  Put him in a headlock, he even took his wig off.  What's wrong with you?  It's Santa Claus. 
[03:15:30]  He was wigless?  Jesus, poor guy.  I felt festive.  That big belt buckle poses a threat.  9-11 security risk.  All right, thanks, Sonny.  Is this your last phone call for today, hopefully?  All right, let's see how the lady died.  Lady died.  How you doing, guys?  Hi.  Happy holidays from me, Marion.  Is it really?  So how is your son spending his holidays? 
[03:16:00]  I'm going to see him.  Where is he spending it?  He's going to be my dad.  That's what he has to buy my son for.  Well, because it is Christmas.  What did he get your son for Christmas?  Everybody wants to know.  I'm going to get him a gift certificate for Christmas.  For how much?  For how much and for what?  I don't know.  Maybe about $50?  Something like that at Modell's.  $50 Modell's gift certificate for the love of your life, son.  What?  He's a huge Giants fan. 
[03:16:30]  I'm probably going to do that.  Yeah.  He's a Giants fan.  Good.  He could be a fan of his mother.  Yeah, and her liver.  So that'll get him one of those imitation Giants jerseys.  You spell it a J.  Hey, hey, hey.  Wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  That's a coincidence because Big Blue is what you'll be when you're dead.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Hey, Di, you know what I want you to do for Christmas?  I want you to put up Christmas lights with your grandson while he goes against the kitchen  knife.  You guys did a great job at the homeless shopping spree.  Marion and I were there. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, I want to thank you for blowing all the bumps for us.  That was very nice to you.  Yeah.  No, you guys didn't really.  Jesus.  Let's go to Hollywood.  Joel.  Yes.  Finally.  Joel McHale from The Soup, everyone.  What's going on?  One of my favorite shows on TV.  How are you, Joel?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to announce I'm going to be in a movie.  Yeah?  Are you?  Bill Burr and I are remaking The Parent Trap.  Ooh.  We're going to remake Face Off. 
[03:17:30]  We should.  We should combine them.  You got Louis C.K. in studio and Bill Burr.  Hey.  And the rest of the gang.  Bunch of redheads.  Yeah.  All over the place in here now.  I'm only red down.  Where are you from?  Boston?  Who?  Me?  Joel.  Oh, no.  Seattle.  Oh, good.  Seattle.  The other side of the country.  Yeah.  We have a lot of clammy skin.  You can't tell the women from the back.  A fucking Christmas tree-less airport.  I'm sorry about that.  Yeah.  I personally apologize.  Now, Joel, I hear a year-end wrap-up in the future. 
[03:18:00]  Well, kind of.  Yeah.  Everyone does them.  I threw things down last night at around 12.  Yeah.  Do you want me to start?  I would like a little info on some of the big, major events that the soup's going to  be covering.  All right.  Well, the story of the year has got to be Britney's Twat, right?  Britney's Twat.  Yes.  It was a very exciting year for Britney's Vagina.  It was a big one.  And I just enjoy the different tactics that all the entertainment shows are using to cover 
[03:18:30]  it up.  Sometimes it's like an Entertainment Tonight logo.  Other times it's an oops, like in one of those Batman Powell Punch logo things.  One time they used a black cock.  That was interesting.  We're actually putting a picture of a baby's head coming out of it.  Do you know...  Crowning Britney.  Do you know what would be funny if they covered it with Terry Schiavo's face?  If they just picked the worst things out of the news to cover it?  Give him fucking Adam Walsh's hat.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:19:00]  Terry Schiavo's 30% brain matter that was left.  Ryan Seacrest covering the Vagina.  Yeah, absolutely.  You've got to keep it clean for TV.  That's a good one.  From what I hear, that's the closest they'll ever get.  But I'm not saying anything, Joel.  I know you've got to see him in the hallway.  We just hear things.  That's all.  Well, I don't really see him.  I have to look down to see him.  Yeah, you have to avert your eyes, right?  Well, no, because he's 4'11".  Oh, right.  Okay.  Well, yes, I do have to avert my eyes, of course.  There's a mandate. 
[03:19:30]  I hear that was something just if he was going to work on E, it was going to be nobody.  We had to clear the hallways, no eye contact.  We had to go through his people just to ask him things.  Yeah, it's got to be a bitch.  Seacrest.  No, no, I made up a lot of stuff.  Seacrest out.  Seacrest out.  Seacrest, ugh.  He left?  No.  No, no.  Well, yeah, he did leave with a lot of money, and he's coming back in three weeks.  Oh.  He must make, like, the entire budget for your show, right?  The entire guy.  Oh, he makes, I'm not joking, seven times our budget. 
[03:20:00]  Seven times the entire budget for the soup.  Yeah.  He got, like, a three-year, $25 million deal.  But really, how much could it be to pay you and keep a green screen from getting creases in it?  That's pretty much your show, isn't it?  You'd be amazed at how expensive that green screen is.  That thing is like remaking the Titanic every week.  Hey, you and Hal Sparks are fighting?  Well, uh. 
[03:20:30]  He used to be the host of the soup, or.  He gave a quote in the New York Times article.  It says, Joel seems to have no problem picking at me, Mr. Sparks said in a telephone interview,  but I would remind him that he may be making fun of me now, but at some point in his life,  he, too, will be a former talk soup host.  Well.  He should think about that.  Well, uh, how about another.  I'd like to remind him that I'm not going to be on Celebrity Paranormal Project.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't talk too fast.  How about an Academy Award nominated former host of the soup? 
[03:21:00]  How about that?  How about that?  Yeah, deal with that.  Yeah, I don't know if you've seen some.  We would have made fun of him had he not been on Celebrity Paranormal Project.  That's true.  But you had to make fun of him.  You guys seen that show?  Yeah.  It sucked.  Gary Busey, just asking for unsolicited hugs from no-name play.  I don't even know who they were.  It was great.  Jimmy played a good trick, wasn't it, on Hell Sparks?  Was it him?  Did he really?  At, um, Tollins Show.  Oh, one of the things we used to love to do, a tough crowd, was, um.  It's a great gag. 
[03:21:30]  It's funny.  I would stand in the doorway, and, like, the regulars, like Patrice, and a couple other  guys would be in the green room.  So, whoever was on that week, I would start asking them a question.  I'd be like, so, what have you been doing?  Have you been going on the road?  And they'd go, well, yeah.  And as soon as they started getting a roll, I would slam the door and walk out, so their  fucking mid-sentence was cut off.  Fucking Colbert loved it.  Jeff Garland tolerated it.  Most people enjoyed it, but, oh, how?  Couldn't take it.  He didn't like it.  Wow, that might be funny if you know someone.  Or, ah, it's funnier if you don't.  Of course it is. 
[03:22:00]  Of course.  It's so much funnier.  If I was, if someone asked me a question, and I started answering seriously, and they  slammed the door in my face, and we're gone, I would be fucking pissing myself laughing.  If you knew that fucking door slammed.  Yeah, but see, it's even funnier for other people that he took offense to it.  That makes it, for me, funnier.  The way it would work is, as someone was talking, I'd be standing there.  I don't even know the guy.  I hate him now from just this conversation.  I'd be standing there, like, fucking arm propped up, and Patrice would be laughing already 
[03:22:30]  because he knew where I was.  He knew where I was coming.  And I would keep goading somebody with questions until I got the right role going, so we were  all laughing, and they had no idea.  They thought they were telling a great story.  And he does being set up.  Oh, is he?  I'm in the doorway.  That should be a show in itself.  Right.  The slam-the-door reality show.  You can cover it on the soup where you fucking have.  I would watch that.  That would be a great talk show.  And have real guests of weight, like Paul Newman, you know.  What was it like working on The Sting?  Well, I'll tell you.  Slam. 
[03:23:00]  Shut up, you old.  Shut up, click, close the door.  And then you could interview, like, Terry Schiavo's husband.  Oh, right.  What was the last thing she said to you?  And then you think you got him, but that was actually the last thing she said to you.  Right.  And then we could talk to you right after you slammed the door.  Yeah.  You got to make sure the hinges are oiled because the creaking, he might think she's back.  Do you think that was a perfect opportunity for the slam right there, or should you have  gone in during that abortion story? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, sure.  Should I replant?  The thing with this Hal Sparks guy, though, is being the host of that show, Soup, the  whole point of it is making fun of everybody on television.  Yeah.  You, if, if...  So then he leaves and wants...  Yeah.  So then he leaves and then doesn't want to be made fun of.  If you leave, you're on the other side of the line.  You can't demand respect for him.  Yeah.  It's not like we go, all right, today we are going to ream Daniel Day-Lewis.  Yeah.  You know, the...  He never does anything.  I'm getting an idea.  The door slam bit during the Chris Hansen pedophile show.  Oh. 
[03:24:00]  The pedophile just gets up and slams the door in Chris Hansen's face when he's talking to  him about sex with underage children.  What are you doing here?  Huh?  That's it.  What?  What are you doing here?  What are you doing here?  Hi, how are you?  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  And they all sit down.  Because they're still hard.  And it's like, yeah, yeah.  I might still get laid.  Might be the last fuck of my life, but I'm going to get it.  And you know he's like hoping...  I hope this guy's leaving because I really want to fuck somebody.  I got to fuck this chick.  Was this guy on the internet, too? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Dude, me first, all right?  Sloppy seconds.  You wait in the other room.  I don't care.  You're first.  I don't care how many fucking cameras you're brought, sicko.  Did you see that doctor that they caught?  He's the only guy I saw who had the brains the second he saw an adult come walking out.  He was just like, fuck this.  I'm out of here.  He ran.  And he just started walking away.  And immediately, all the cops came in.  And this dude literally took his glasses off and lifted him above his head.  If he was a black guy, he would have got shot 50 times.  Yeah, with the first glasses. 
[03:25:00]  He lifted his glasses and he goes, God damn it.  And he just threw him down.  It was awesome.  Do you know what has to go through a man's head at that moment where you walk out of  the house, you think maybe you're going to get away, and just, get on the ground, get  on the ground.  And you're like, all of a sudden, the wife, the kids, work, everything is just.  Fuck that, getting raped in prison.  And then getting out and having a bumper sticker that says, I fucked the kid for the rest of  the life.  Right, yeah.  Some kind of, oh.  And then, and half the guys were from India, which was really weird. 
[03:25:30]  Really?  Yeah, there was a lot of them.  Really?  A lot of them.  When Indians were going to shave that fucking Bursi Indian pussy, it's fucking awful.  So they just don't want to groan in the first place.  It was well-timed, though, though.  I saw a great one the other day.  You know, you ever see the ones where they try to catch people, they're trying to hire  somebody to kill their spouse?  Oh, that's always a good one.  And it works all the time.  Well, they had this, they had this one guy, right?  He's trying to hire this dude to kill his wife. 
[03:26:00]  And they're going through the whole thing, and they make sure that, you know, they got  the deal done, and the cops just come flying in.  And as they're putting the guy on the ground, he's going, just shoot me.  It's over.  Just shoot me.  Just kill me.  He's begging for that.  That's such entrapment.  You can do that with any husband on the planet Earth.  Hey, I could kill your wife.  Really?  That guy already felt the unwanted cock going in his ass.  He's like, ah, just shoot me.  That's all he was thinking about.  Like, that whole thing.  It's not going to be.  Are you going to kill my wife or not?  Yeah, right. 
[03:26:30]  They're not going to kill my wife.  He doesn't care about the cock in the ass.  Officer, I have to.  It wasn't real.  She's not going to die today.  Shoot me.  Officer, I have some business to tend to here.  Can I have a minute, please?  Oh.  Yeah, because all you're thinking is that, like, the process.  You know from that moment for the rest of your life, it's not like, all right, what is this?  It's going to be 10, 20 minutes and we're through.  It's like, from here, the rest of your life is now something completely different than it was three seconds ago. 
[03:27:00]  You would have a bad reputation if you had committed murder.  Right.  Yeah.  Even over, like, there's that thing, like, yeah, we wanted to kill his wife, so we hired somebody.  But with a pedophile thing, that's it.  You leave the country.  Yep.  That guy was saying, too, he's like, you have to make it look like an accident because if the cops start questioning me, he knew he was going to fold.  Yeah.  So when they came in, he just completely.  I don't fold on the questioning.  He just went on the floor.  Come on, you guys are married.  You know what I'm going through.  Just shoot me. 
[03:27:30]  Okay, just wing her.  Just shoot her in the side of it and offer something.  It never works, and the video and audio tapes are so incriminating.  Like, those guys don't even have the couth to maybe use some code words and stuff.  It's like, look, I need you to blow this cunt's head off.  Yeah.  No, my wife with a big gun, so the head is completely gone.  With this money I want to give to you that I'm paying you right now.  My name is.  Actually, here's the gun.  I'd like you to use.  If there's any mistake, it's not. 
[03:28:00]  Imagine seeing a video tape of your wife.  Alan Funt and Fanny Fleck and bust them.  It's so obvious.  And now she's going to visit him every fucking weekend.  So.  Yeah.  It's going to have me killed.  Hey, how's it going?  Still here.  Then you see them in their prison skivvies, and they've been clearly beaten down.  Not maybe literally beaten, but they're so demoralized when they're before the judge.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're just like, yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, what else can they say?  I apologize. 
[03:28:30]  I'm sorry.  I never really meant to.  No, they always say I was just checking to see if she was okay.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the best.  And then they're like, yeah, but you brought condoms.  Well, I always have them.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm responsible.  Condoms and Zima for this.  Yeah.  They always bring, like, Zima.  They bring some kind of awful, like, wine coolers.  Something young chicks dig, you know?  Mike's lemonade.  Mike's hard lemonade.  And hard lemonade for a nine-year-old.  And cookies.  And hard Mike is bringing them. 
[03:29:00]  What if Chris were to rip him about that?  Couldn't you have brought something nice?  Maybe like Heineken or a nice Cabernet?  You had to bring this crap?  Can you imagine that fucking emotion?  You go from, I'm going to fuck this 12-year-old.  Like, that's your thing.  Sure.  That's your big thing.  You're in a froth.  And then this dude comes walking out, and you've got the bag of cookies.  Yeah, the bag of cookies, some kind of alcohol.  And he's going, you said, I want to lick your, well, I can't use this language on television,  but I think you can.  Fuck, I did write that. 
[03:29:30]  Holy shit.  I was being sarcastic.  Yeah, come on.  It was irony.  The guys that think, you know, I like the guys that are like, it's a fantasy that is played  out on the internet and stuff.  Yes, but you're here in a house now with the girl.  I can see you.  Do you see that one guy in Texas killed himself?  Huh?  That one guy in Texas killed himself?  Yeah, they got a guy that killed himself.  Prosecutor, right?  Yeah, he was a prosecutor.  They went right to his house, and then they got the door open, and then he was standing  there with a gun to his head, and that was that. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, and then I guess one of them finally got convicted, the rabbi.  He got convicted.  Oh, that's right.  That story was very recently.  You would think now with pedophiles, they must be so scared that if you show up at a house  and the girl goes, just make yourself at home, you would cry.  Yeah, but nothing brings down a boner.  There's nothing, if you've got a heart on, the boner is in firm control, literally. 
[03:30:30]  There's got to be a thing now.  The second you're, if she takes you out back near the pool, fuck that, get out of there.  Yeah, you see the guy by the pool, and they're sitting down at that little bar by the pool,  and she goes, let me just get my bathing suit on.  And he's just, no, the whole time he's like, somewhere in his head, he's like, my odds are  going down.  Yeah, yeah, I'm still in.  I'm still in.  I'm in for the long haul, but it's looking grim.  I could be going to prison.  I could be going to prison, but.  That's the thing about your dick.  Your dick is a believer.  Yeah.  It's just constantly, but no, no, I think it's going to be cool.  No, dude, you're fucking her in this pool, dude. 
[03:31:00]  I don't like it, man.  I don't like it.  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  Picture it, you.  It's going to happen.  The home counter's overhead, but you're still believing.  Yeah.  Yeah, in the background, it's like, did I just hear that?  21, 25, location.  Did I just hear something?  It's the radio.  It's got to be the neighbor.  Move in, move in, move in.  No, it's the neighbors.  They're moving.  She's like, I'm watching Daylight NBC on television.  It's that pedophile show.  What a coincidence.  She has an awful voice, too.  She sounds like Jodie Foster going under that thing. 
[03:31:30]  Remember, she goes under the fucking garage door.  Could you just let them know I'm here?  Oh, sir.  If anything.  And there was even that one guy who was like, were you going to have sex with that 13-year-old?  He's like, well, if she looked like that, I was probably going to.  You've got to respect that.  The guy that fessed up to it.  I couldn't believe she was 13.  Did you?  And he's like, no, she's 18.  I think pedophilia must be so fun.  To be worth all of that, to be worth the risk and the punishment, it must be awesome.  Just looking at what people go through to get it. 
[03:32:00]  It must be like the greatest thing.  It can't be just like a mild, that was all right.  It must be awesome.  It's the most guilty feeling I have watching that show.  For some reason, even though these guys are pedophiles, I want the host to get punched.  Oh, yeah.  I think smarmy.  He's just smarmy.  Very smarmy.  There is that.  Well, what are you doing here?  He's going to get attacked at some point.  What are you doing?  Yeah, he walks out.  That guy's spending all his time talking to pedophiles.  There's something fucked up about that guy.  Yeah.  I think he's jerking off.  It's turned into a series that just doesn't end.  It was a one thing on one of these news stories, expose things, and it got such high ratings 
[03:32:30]  that they keep doing it over and over again.  They're probably out of pedophiles.  They're probably just actors.  They're shipping them in.  They're actually plumbers.  Come on and fix my sink.  And then comes 12 years ago.  Hey, buddy.  How are you doing?  You want to come on?  All right.  What are you doing here?  I see you brought a toolbox with you.  What were you going to do with that monkey wrench?  Fixers.  The sink.  You said it was leaking.  A leaky sink.  A leaky sink.  Unlikely story. 
[03:33:00]  From the phone call, you said you were going to fix her pipes.  What does that mean?  I was going to fix her pipes?  The union plumber.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get Joel out.  It sounds like you've just combined To Catch a Predator and Extreme Makeover.  Well, a few different shows there, sure.  Why not?  That would be great.  They'd build a house for the 13-year-old girl they're using to entrap them with.  And then arrest all the construction workers.  I like it.  Except for Ty Pennington.  He'll just be screaming and they'll just hit him with a dart. 
[03:33:30]  Please.  Joe, what's the big plug?  We got to...  Yeah.  No, we have not only one, but two year-end specials, everybody.  Wouldn't fit in one show.  It's not fitting in one show.  I said I want to get paid twice.  Nice.  We have one show that's like the best 20 clips of the year.  Britney Spears' vagina makes numerous appearances.  And that's not even the clips.  We just have her.  We're going to have Dr. Robert Ray from Dr. 90210 cut it out and bring it on the show.  Just bring her little fucking fat box. 
[03:34:00]  Bring that.  That was a nice plump one, wasn't it?  It really was.  She'll have that molded and sell it like the porn stars do.  She should.  It was a little too plump.  I didn't start jerking off to Britney until she got fat.  I like the fat.  You like the plump?  I like the chubby version.  There's one photo of her dropping that kid on a curb.  How do you not jerk off to that?  Her tits are hanging out and that skull's about to be broken on a curb.  It makes her possible.  I could see being at a gas station and she's filling up a Taurus at the other pump.  Yeah.  She blows me in the bathroom like I could see that happen.  It's doable, man.  It's doable.  Yeah, when she's all rock hard, she's out of your league. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, she's at Sky Bar.  It's not happening.  No.  Oh, just think about all the leather burns her poor little vagina got during all that clubbing  without any underwear on.  Oh, boy.  The couch is just as she moved off the couch.  Sliding out of the Escalade.  That's why I was hairless.  Yeah.  She never shaved.  It just got rubbed off.  Her pussy looked like Hal Holbrook's mouth.  That's actually what they say in the salons here.  Give me the whole thing. 
[03:35:00]  Hal Holbrook.  We have one more special the week after Christmas or something.  And that one is like the top stories of the year, of course.  Of course.  Got to do the wrap up.  Yeah.  And my guess is, I don't know, this Tom Cruise guy will make it.  Lindsay Lohan.  Yes.  Her liver will make it in.  Yeah.  And her strangely 40-year-old lungs voice and skin will make it as well.  And how about Nicole Richie and the weight loss? 
[03:35:30]  I'm very alarmed.  I love how on her license it said 100 pounds.  And of course, just like many vain women, she had to tell the officer she weighed 85.  Yeah.  Because she's not that fat.  No.  I'm 85.  That's like a sixth grader driving a SUV.  I saw, I read a description of her that was perfect.  And I never heard it for like anorexic girls.  A sack full of antlers.  You never heard that?  No.  It's so fitting.  I heard a guy at a meeting one time say he'd be like making love to a gunny sack full of antlers. 
[03:36:00]  He called it a gunny sack.  A gunny sack full of antlers.  You would get poked by her if you tried to hug her.  Oh, yeah.  Her elbow would just go right through your side.  Her hip bones are sticking out.  Yeah.  Oh, the poor girl.  Driving the wrong way.  On the freeway, I drive every day.  Thank you.  All right, Joel.  All right.  How you do that?  Happy holidays.  Have a great time on Leno, you guys.  Thank you, sir.  Take it easy, Joel.  Nice.  Nice.  We'll catch you on the soup there, Joel.  Thank you. 
[03:36:30]  Thank you.  Soup.  Oh, um.  Check it out.  Oh.  I think you got him a little bit.  Yeah, let's go to Tony Rivoli.  Tony, Rivoli's.  Merry Christmas, gentlemen.  Yes, Tom's River.  What's up?  Merry Christmas, gentlemen.  Thank you, sir.  I want to thank you for the pleasure you've given me through the year.  It's a great restaurant.  Also, on your way down to see the great Jimmy Norton at Borgata on New Year's Eve, you gentlemen  have an open invitation to come into the restaurant.  Put you in the back room.  Nobody will bother you guys.  What time is it open until?  It's right off the highway, right? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, it's like 10 miles off the parkway.  We might just have to do that.  Unless you have about 200 poker tables in your restaurant, I'm beelining it to Atlantic  City.  Let's stop on the way to Atlantic City.  Yeah, I love the place.  The food is second to none.  The hookers and gambling can wait.  Yeah, I really got to get down and play some cards and food I can get 10 seconds from my  house.  Yeah.  All right, Tony.  Could you bring a plate to the parkway rest area and the car can slow down and we'll just  take it into the window? 
[03:37:30]  Thank you.  Meet you at the exit.  You take it to go.  All right.  See you, buddy.  Okay, gentlemen.  Have a great holiday.  Do a great job on Leno.  And thanks for everything, Tony.  Thank you, sir.  It's Big A.  Big A.  Oh, no.  Hello?  Big A.  He's probably already started to talk.  Yeah, he has.  He has.  Big A.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Big A.  Everyone, wish everybody a Merry Christmas.  Happy Holidays.  Thank you, you blathering mountain. 
[03:38:00]  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  So, what are you doing for Christmas, Big A?  Oh, Hanukkah.  I'm sorry, you Jew.  He's got the Hanukkah thing.  What are you doing for Hanukkah?  Family?  Yes.  You're a cantor, aren't you?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be in my family's house. 
[03:38:30]  I'll be in my family's house, yes.  He's just tongue to put the menorah out.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, Big A.  Goodbye, Andrew.  I'm just teasing you.  Happy Holidays, man.  All right.  All right.  Bye, buddy.  Let's go to Frenchie.  I do really like Big A.  I have to say that so he doesn't put his...  Happy Holidays.  All right, go ahead.  You talk while I was talking.  There's no reason for me to finish.  I mean, you're French and you kill on the show.  Go right ahead.  Happy Holidays.  Shut up, you, you baldy fuck. 
[03:39:00]  How you doing, man?  Better now, huh?  Happy Holidays.  I just want to say a great party last night.  I just woke up maybe five minutes ago.  I'm going to work now.  Lucky people.  I'm still fucked up and I'm still deaf from last night.  Everyone that went to this party last night is still drunk.  I can't even remember.  The party was last night?  It's getting late.  There was some kind of party that was at some bar.  I can't even tell you where it was.  It was a live band karaoke.  That's pretty cool.  So people choose from songs, get up with a live band and sing karaoke with the band. 
[03:39:30]  That is.  You got to get drunk for it.  Yeah, you got to get drunk for it.  So everybody was hammered and I was even pulling the gag where, you know, someone would buy  me a beer and I'd be drinking it and then they'd buy me another one and no matter what  level the first beer was at, it goes up on the shelf and I just thought on the second  one and I was doing that like all night and still.  Still got drunk.  Still got drunk.  Fuck.  I didn't finish one beer and I got drunk. 
[03:40:00]  I don't know how that happened.  Like a quarter of 58 beers.  Exactly.  Are we going to get, is Kenny still here to do Secret Agent Man?  I'm busy.  It's travel day.  And Big Kev's here.  Oh.  Big Kev wants to give some gifts or something.  Oh, Big Kev's a nice guy.  And his old Tinder box head.  You want to sing Secret Agent Man with Pamela?  I got to pull the car around.  All right.  I want to see an Indian rub a stick together real fast in your scalp and just start it. 
[03:40:30]  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  My question is, at what point did you realize that we all got it without the blowing?  When you looked at me with that laugh, that isn't laughing at the joke, it's laughing  directly at me.  That's when I know.  I saw your eyes.  It was one of those that just, it wasn't even like, oh, that's not funny.  It was like, what's going on in here?  Yeah. 
[03:41:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Anthony's eyes opened as it was going down and went.  I'm like, there's just always this moment where you're peshy walking into that fucking  room.  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  You know, I thought this was going to be good, and I got shot in the face.  That's my favorite scene in any movie.  Rubbing the hands.  Yeah.  Nick DiPaolo described once going to this bar in Boston and picking up girls and telling  them, there's a big party at my apartment, and there's nobody there. 
[03:41:30]  And that's the same moment she walks in and sees you and goes, oh, and then she gets hit  with a load of cum in the back of the head.  Oh.  Come on to my place.  This is a big party.  Big Kev?  The floor is yours.  What do we have?  Here he is.  Big Kev.  Okay.  Good morning, guys.  And the mic works.  Wow.  I brought a couple of Christmas gifts.  Christmas gifts because of you guys.  Happy holidays, boys.  Hey, thank you, sir. 
[03:42:00]  Mike Cole.  Wait, we got to wait for Sam.  I mean, Sam.  Can we get Mike a gift?  We can get Mike a gift.  He looks like the Grinch out of costume.  I don't want you to go away for Christmas without having a gift from a fat person.  So I brought a few.  All right.  Oh, they're wrapped, too.  Oh, thank you.  With my gift.  Unwrapping of gifts.  That's nice.  Keep asking for the white man.  Oh.  No gift for you, stupid.  Drew got all excited.  Oh.  Hey. 
[03:42:30]  There you go.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Thank you.  Kiss it.  Kiss it.  Kiss it.  Kiss it.  It's a 3D Jaws movie poster.  Oh, I like that.  That's awesome.  Finally got a gift for Opie that I think you'll actually appreciate.  Yeah, Kurt Cobain, man.  Nice.  Action figure.  Oh, boy.  Oh, fucking cool.  Does it come with the accessories?  That's just the guitar accessories.  All these accessories.  No shells.  I got this Christmas brought to you by Times Square.  What's that?  Cool shirt, man.  Christmas brought to you by Times Square. 
[03:43:00]  Christmas brought to you by Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  No, this is a cool shirt.  This is actually the back of a shirt that I already own.  This is like they put on the front.  Yeah.  Black Sabbath t-shirt.  Nice.  No, but no, I have this on the back already.  So you can trick people.  But they just put on the front, but it's good.  What?  Now you can trick people.  Yeah, they'll think I'm backing up at them.  Well, Merry Christmas.  Thanks a lot, Big Kev.  Thank you, Kev. 
[03:43:30]  Why don't you give me a fucking Yankee hat with the NY on the other side of the bill?  Why don't you give me a fucking girl with a pussy on her back?  Man, you are just taking this for miles.  That's great.  Miles?  I went three feet and sputtered out.  Thank you, Kev.  All right, let's get out of here.  I don't want to get out of here.  I want to look at gifts.  Now it's time to...  Line of the Day, sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Here is the runner-up line of the day.  Gold medal doing that. 
[03:44:00]  Just picturing Jim with those fucking wrestling things that come in your ears.  The wrestling things that look like headphones, yeah.  Coming all over the mat.  Well, no, you come right through your old school thigh-high Roman Greco wrestling suit,  and they see a big semen stain, and everybody knows what just happened.  You made a cumsy.  What the fuck did I make a cumsy?  There you go.  And finally, the line of the day, sponsored by BodogFight.com. 
[03:44:30]  Check out their website.  What's that?  Something else?  Okay, here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day.  You know she was up on this little step stool with those half-calf stockings,  a little stretched out and rolled out, showing her aged, liver-spotted skin that's transparent, 
[03:45:00]  the blue veins, marble white vagina lips, bloodless, that was the line of the day right there.  Louis C.K., very good.  Oh, CokeLogic's got something.  CokeLogic.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  I just want to know who won the video contest.  Oh, that's right.  $1,000 up for grabs, right? 
[03:45:30]  HopMovies.com?  Yes.  We got the three finalists.  In third place was Bob Kelly's Puke animated version by Nelson.  That was cool.  Yeah, that was a good one.  The Square People.  They redid a Bob Kelly segment on our show with Square People.  That was very good.  That came in third place.  One I saw for the first time only, I think, last night, the PVD, the plushie versus Dom.  That was really creepy, but really, really good.  That was by Ryan.  That was that whole scenario of the guy in the bunny suit. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he winds up killing the hooker after he gets fucked in the ass with a strap on.  Well, the guy made it.  And then he's going like, oh, I just wanted it.  You know, I didn't think it would come to this.  The animation the guy made for that bit is unbelievable.  Really crazy.  Are all the finalists up on OpieandAnthony.com?  Yes.  They should be up there.  And CokeLogic, yes, you won the $1,000.  He did Uncle Paul, right?  He did an animation of Uncle Paul, Jimmy's character.  He won the video contest, the $1,000, courtesy of HotMovies.com. 
[03:46:30]  There were some really good ones that should get honorable mention, but so don't freak out  and say, I should have won.  That one sucked.  Well, the contest went so well, we're going to do it again in the new year.  I think we're going to start up in the middle of January.  You did a very nice job.  Good boy.  Hello.  Yeah, I'm trying to be silent so I can get more audio to call you.  I'm talking to you.  Hello, Uncle Paul. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's get out of here.  No, I just wanted to say that you did a good job.  Oh, thank you.  That means a lot.  It's a combo.  A combo meal.  All the videos are up on OpieandAnthony.com.  CokeLogic, thank you so much.  Good job, man.  Happy holidays.  Merry Christmas.  You too.  Happy Hanukkah.  Yes.  And that's all I recognize, really.

The 21st, I believe that is, right?  What the fuck is that?  What is this?  Who is this, too?  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Some more wine.  Cool.  Nice.  All right.  Get us out of here.  We'll see you guys soon.  Very good.  Next year.  Later, man.  Later.  Thank you.
