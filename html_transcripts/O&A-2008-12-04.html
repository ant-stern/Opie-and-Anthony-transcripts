<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Jim Norton Show begins with speculation about Anthony's absence, attributed to a workplace "gassing" incident affecting multiple staff members.  The hosts discuss major company restructuring, including management and engineering consolidations, a relocation, and increased voice-tracking.  Jim Norton's unexpected obsession with the *Maude* theme song becomes a recurring comedic element throughout the broadcast.  Norton recounts a bizarre encounter with Kate Gosselin at a book signing, highlighting the overwhelmingly female fan base and their lack of interest in him.  This sparks a discussion about the show's audience demographics.

Numerous listener calls follow, focusing on the surprising popularity of TLC shows featuring large families and people with dwarfism, a debate on the perceived usefulness of little people, and a segment mocking Rich Voss's alleged high IQ, including a bit where he attempts to identify celebrities from pictures.  News stories are covered, including the murder of a lawyer in an S&M-related love triangle and a man accidentally shooting his wife during sex.  Norton also shares a memorable line from his movie *Zach and Miri Make a Porno*.

Anthony's return is marked by the announcement of his recent hair transplant.  Bill Burr is revealed as a scheduled guest.  A "Primetime Gossip" segment follows, detailing Anthony's hair procedure and speculating about future cosmetic surgeries, further fueled by listener calls.

A subsequent segment opens with Opie recounting a delayed flight due to pilots picking up takeout. This leads to a discussion about Opie’s preference for older, experienced, ideally fighter-pilot-trained airline captains over younger ones.  The hosts then discuss Jessica Cox, an armless pilot, expressing a mix of amazement and morbid fascination.  Jesse, a caller, shares his disbelief.

Bill Burr then joins the show in studio.  Conversation covers Burr's experience with the "Perfect Push-up" device, aging, and the challenges of stand-up comedy. Burr also discusses his own hair restoration procedure and the awkwardness of recovery, including wearing a bandana.  The hosts and Burr engage in banter about the bandana and potential gang affiliations.  The discussion broadens to reality TV shows like *The Biggest Loser* and *Celebrity Rehab*, criticizing their manipulative editing and exploitation of participants.  They discuss celebrities like Tawny Kitaen and Stephen Adler, focusing on their struggles.  Opie recounts a negative experience hiring an escort.


Anthony returns to share his own negative experience with an escort service, detailing his complaints to the agency and a Better Business Bureau-like organization. He then vents about his purchase of a ShamWow, deeming it inferior to paper towels.  The hosts promote Burr’s upcoming Caroline’s shows and Norton’s D.C. shows, briefly mentioning the Boston Bruins and Brett Favre.  A major discussion ensues about *John & Kate Plus 8*, with the hosts, Burr, and a caller named Sam heavily criticizing Kate Gosselin's behavior, calling her a "bitch" and condemning her parenting. Sam plays audio clips highlighting the Gosselins' dysfunctional relationship.  The segment concludes with a discussion of the NHL’s suspension of Sean Avery for using “sloppy seconds,” comparing it to the lack of punishment for on-ice violence, playing audio clips of aggressive trash talk.  The segment ends with discussions about the auto industry bailout and economic anxieties, including speculation about a potential "one world bank" and conspiracy theories; Jim Norton mentions getting a hair transplant.

The following segment begins with a critique of the devaluation of the dollar and NAFTA, leading to a broader discussion about the power of global banks, described as "legalized extortion" and "rapists."  The hosts speculate about the future of humanity, a single global currency, and space colonization.  This leads to a discussion on overpopulation and potential population reduction.  The Patriot Act is compared to Nazi actions, leading to speculation about government overreach and a dystopian future with microchips and a feudal system. Ralphie May joins at [03:00:30], contributing to the discussion of human nature, societal control, global economics, and technology’s role in human evolution.  The conversation includes humorous interjections, a hypothetical scenario of the hosts in a detention camp, and comparing Duracell commercials to potential government tracking devices.


The final segment features a hypothetical disaster scenario discussion, using Hurricane Katrina as an example. The hosts, Burr, and May debate survival strategies, using highly offensive language and derogatory terms towards those who didn't evacuate.  The conversation touches upon race, poverty, and personal responsibility.  A vulgar exchange about firearms follows, detailing personal arsenals and experiences with hunting and shooting. The conversation shifts back to survival skills, focusing on water purification and fire-starting, with Ralphie May's expertise being challenged and mocked. The segment ends with further discussion of survival skills, celebrity mentions, and promotional announcements for the guests' upcoming shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Jim Norton Show.  Did Anthony get gassed or is he late? You never know these days.  Did they gass Anthony last night and they didn't tell me yet?  We don't know?  Well, I was happy that, you know, my security thing worked today. 
[00:00:30]  When I put that thing down and I hear beep, I'm like, alright, I still got a gig.  I just saw, the way Kenny stood back, I thought that Ant walked in and then it was just E-Rock walked in.  Yeah, well, my apologies to Ant for confusing E-Rock with him.  Okay, that's E-Rock.  It's a weird time for radio.  How many people got gassed yesterday, Stunt Brain?  Uh, there's one I know of, Corey, in programming.  Corey, as in CT? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, from CT and Jiven over on the other side.  Where's Corey?  I know, Jiven.  Corey's a nice dude.  He does a radio show with Jiven who does the dump button for us here in the morning.  Great guy.  Great guy.  He got gassed?  Yep.  Just a strange, strange time to be doing radio.  Yes.  What do you rock?  Yeah, they blew out some of the controllers, too.  What the hell's a controller?  They, uh...  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  What the hell's a controller?  They're basically in charge of paychecks. 
[00:01:30]  So how did we get...  Uh-oh.  And it's not just this station.  A couple other stations got their controllers blown out.  So what are they doing?  They're just leaving the paychecks laying around the mailroom and hope that you find yours?  We were all summoned to the conference room yesterday about 11.  Yeah.  And we met the new guy, Don.  The guy that you met in Boston.  Oh, yeah, yeah, well...  And he announced the new structure, what they're doing.  There's going to be one GM for the city, one financial person for the city,  one engineer in charge of all the stations. 
[00:02:00]  And we're all going to this beehive downtown where all the stations are going to be.  And they are going to voice track the hell out of radio.  Is that what's going on in Cleveland?  They decided there's an actual...  The radio station we used to be on, now it's just jockless.  And they're bragging that they're jockless.  It's just...  It's a jukebox.  It's officially a jukebox.  It's like that Jack thing that was here, remember?  Yeah.  And that worked.  Oh, boy.  Well, you never knew what you were going to get.  But more importantly, guys... 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  My head...  I want to lop my own head off.  I told Oak when I walked in.  I got to say, Jimmy, you get hooked on the strangest things.  Like, out of nowhere, it's kind of fun to wait for you to come in every morning.  Because you'll get obsessed with the most bizarre crap.  And last night, you got obsessed with what?  I was watching Maud online.  Yeah.  The old Bea Arthur show, which I forgot Adrian Barboa's in.  And the Maud theme song has not left my head in about 12 hours. 
[00:03:00]  It's...  Yeah.  And the Lord to guide her.  It's non-stop.  How do you not think of this?  It's all I'm thinking of.  Jonah Barboa with the Lord to guide her.  She was a sister who really cooked.  I should be shot.  Isadora was the first bra burner.  Angel glad she showed up.  Oh, yeah.  This is going great. 
[00:03:30]  Boo!  Be more funny.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What's wrong with you?  Please, dude.  I haven't been toe-tapping.  It's been driving me nuts.  But out of...  There's so much going on.  I know.  You can be obsessed with anything these days.  The Maud theme won't stop.  The Maud theme is just...  Anyone here to turn on PalTalk, that's what they're asking.  Is Anthony late or did he get gassed? 
[00:04:00]  I believe he's late.  He's late.  All right.  Well, that's good.  It was an alarm clock issue.  Just do me a favor.  If we're going to lose key members to the show, please tell me ahead of time.  But knowing this company, they wouldn't.  They would just like, you know...  Yeah, like we heard about Boston.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So the Maud theme is stuck in your head.  Anything that's stuck in your head, you don't plan on it.  And it's not the Maud part, because that's the least cool.  And then there's Maud.  I mean, come on.  You have to admit, that's cool.  Worst lady's name ever, by the way.  Terrible.  We talk about this from time to time. 
[00:04:30]  I love the Gertrudes and all that, but Maud is pretty bad.  Yeah, Hay Hole is more pleasant.  Maud is pretty awful.  She's pretty talented, though.  B. Arthur?  Yeah, B. Arthur had it going on back.  Back, back, back, back.  She's fantastic.  I think what inspired me to go on YouTube and start watching, we were talking the other  day about the molesting episode of the Different Strokes.  Yeah.  It's one of those stupid 70s shows.  Sure.  And I had to watch a little bit of Maud.  I'm like, I don't remember if this was a funny show or not.  Well, I did my homework assignment, and I bet you you didn't. 
[00:05:00]  I bet you Ant didn't.  John and Kate.  John and Kate Plus 8.  Did you watch?  No.  I watched, and I'm sitting there going, man, there's got to be hundreds of listeners watching  this John and Kate because of our radio show.  And Sam, you got clips for a little later on?  All right, good.  Because she was apparently, well, she was literally a block away.  It was such a coincidence.  Well, I guess it wasn't too much of a coincidence.  We saw her dumb mug pop up on local TV.  So I started talking about this show that is driving a lot of guys out there crazy because 
[00:05:30]  their women are into it.  And it turns out that she was doing like some kind of signing literally on our block here  in New York City.  Yeah, Stumbering came in after the show and said, I just got past this fire on the way here  and three yards down from the studio, she was doing a signing.  How crazy is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I got the exclusive.  And what was your email to me?  I just said that I just got the interview from Kate. 
[00:06:00]  She's not a pleasant lady.  Of course she does.  That's what everyone says.  She's not a pleasant lady.  Was there a big crowd there?  There had to be, right?  There actually was.  Yeah.  Of course.  Of course there is.  The show is huge.  Are they all women?  Are they like young gang bangers?  Is she a big, very funny?  Yeah, can you imagine?  It would be funny if she had like the gang member audience if you had no idea.  There was a line outside the store, like around the block almost, and there were, like  mostly women obviously, but there were some women with sensible dues.  Of course.  But there were some middle-aged men there. 
[00:06:30]  No one would talk to me.  Who the hell?  Not one person on that line.  I asked everyone on that line.  Hey, I'm doing some interviews because, you know, I'm just getting some sound bites.  I got to ask you, the middle-aged men, were they a bunch of fruits?  No, they looked, they looked like they didn't want to make eye contact with anyone, so I  think they were, they were John.  But, all right.  Yeah, they would totally be there.  Like, Jimmy got obsessed with Maude, okay?  There's a lot of people watching John and Kate Plus 8, a lot of women, a lot of mothers.  Mm-hmm.  You're a middle-aged man waiting online to see Kate from John and Kate Plus 8. 
[00:07:00]  What are you, what are you looking for?  It seemed like, like they were trying to get the book, because I guess they gave out  a free book to the first 50, uh, people, and they probably wanted to get their, had  to get the book signed for their wife or something.  None of them wanted to be there, wanted anybody to know that they were there.  Oh, okay, that makes sense.  Because I'm wondering, is there, like, a gay following?  Are these guys hoping they have a chance with some bra that has eight kids?  No, it was all emasculated men and awful women.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:07:30]  Was John there?  No, John wasn't there.  John must have been home with the, uh, eight.  Or.  The eight little, uh, eight.  Blessings.  With the blessings.  Or hopefully at a strip club getting, you know, hearts rubbed on them.  That is funny, though.  That's the reason she's such a bitch, is because, like, deep down they had a good marriage,  and then John would always come home with his fingers smelling.  And there was a problem.  And let's not forget about the book that we, uh, discovered yesterday, right, Jimmy?  Yes, eight blessings.  Multiple blessings.  Oh, is it multiple blessings?  Yes.  We say blessings like that because they like to spell blessings. 
[00:08:00]  B-L-E-S-8-I-N-G-S.  Blessings.  Just to drive that message home.  Yeah, very cute.  It's us.  It's us.  Did you get kicked out?  Uh, no.  I got rushed out, though.  I didn't physically get kicked out, but they were, they were real finished with me by the  time.  I got three minutes.  Really?  Before they were all finished with me.  I think they really tried to protect her.  Uh-huh.  Because they were trying to ask me, like, what I was going to ask her before I went in  there, and I just said that I was going to ask about the phenomenon that, you know, why 
[00:08:30]  people are so attracted to the show and everything.  The phenomenon.  The minute I started to get at all negative, I was, okay, all right, we got to get.  So they're on the lookout for shock jock.  Yeah.  And shock jockery.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  He doesn't look like the typical, by the way.  Sam looks like he's 11 years old.  Yeah.  With a ragamuffin haircut.  He doesn't look like the type of John and Kate fan.  Well, good news, too, by the way, TLC, you know, brings you John and Kate Plus 8.  Also, my favorite show, Little People Big World with the little midgets.  I love just mocking them and watching their dumb show. 
[00:09:00]  I'm obsessed with that dumb show.  It does bring a tear to my eye every once in a while because he somehow made it work  with not much of a body.  Baby calves.  Guy can't walk.  He's on crutches.  He has four kids, three regular-sized kids, and one little midget.  A little midget, and they seem to have a normal life.  And the guy makes a bloody fortune.  I would love to know how he makes his money.  There's a show that Bob Kelly crying over show was about midgets, and it was- 
[00:09:30]  Oh, the famous-  Yeah.  That's the show.  Right.  Where they chronicle the life of a few midgets, and there was one woman-  The guy was the midget, and the wife was a regular-sized person, and they had a kid,  and the kid was a midget.  It was a dwarf.  Right.  And it just, it's like, to me, there's never been a better example of who's to blame.  Like, you know, when the kid came out, and it was a midget, you know that the wife had 
[00:10:00]  to pretend she didn't want to just punch her husband's little face.  Like, well, we both know whose DNA caused this little problem, don't we?  I lived a sheltered life on Long Island, because before Little People, Big World, I thought,  I really thought that midgets were useless.  I really did.  I really did.  I really thought they were useless and couldn't, like, live a normal life.  And now this dumb show made me realize they're just people like you and I.  I thought they were good for, like, tossing and throwing them on skateboards to bowl with 
[00:10:30]  and stuff.  They're good wrestlers.  Good wrestlers.  Yeah.  Remember the WWF back a long time ago used to bring out the midgets to wrestle in between  the big matches?  But now this show proves to me that, no, they could do normal things.  I'm amazed.  I'm not even joking, by the way.  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  No, no, I'm just looking at it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we'll get to that story.  And the other show on TLC is this one we talked about yesterday, the 17 and counting. 
[00:11:00]  17 kids and counting.  But the 18th kid is on the way.  We were just talking about this yesterday.  The paper is talking about how the 18th kid is on the way.  And not only, TLC is going to show the birth.  They're filming the birth of the 18th kid.  Yeah, January 2nd or 7th, baby J is due.  Yeah.  They even have laid out the whole life of this kid before it's born.  Yeah.  So, TLC is getting it done.  Let's say hi to Megan in D.C.  Megan! 
[00:11:30]  Hey, you guys, I really appreciate all the recent attempts to draw in the ladies.  Well, not really.  I mean, it's a guy thing.  I think there's shows out there where we get kind of stuck with.  And John and K Plus 8 is one of these shows.  Well, anyway, I just wanted to tell Jimmy that I'm coming to see him tomorrow night,  and I'm excited about it.  Oh, thank you, sweetheart.  I'll be in the Falls Church, Virginia at the State Theater.  Thank you.  Come up and say hello at the end.  Yeah, you're leaving today, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's the show.  Me and Kenny heading down.  Very, very cool.  Are you going to do anything for Jimmy? 
[00:12:00]  Well, I saw him in Houston, and I brought him a present there.  So I'll try to find something.  Okay.  Oh, what was the present?  I don't know.  It's been a while since I've been in Houston.  Jimmy, hold on.  I got to ask Jimmy.  Jimmy, what was the present she got you when you were in Houston?  I mean, it was very nice of her.  Come on.  Come on.  I remember.  All right.  Come on.  You reveal it.  No, no, no.  Take a guess, Jimmy.  What thing did you throw in the garbage after she walked away?  In Jamaica, they called their chicken soup something else there, and it was a packet of that. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Yeah, I remember.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was cool, actually.  You didn't come to the show alone, either.  No, I brought my husband.  Right.  You know, I remember you guys, actually.  But I'm the real fan.  Thank you very much.  He was just basically a pretender.  All right.  But please, call up with your favorite Maud stories.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What do you got?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got the family guy Maud thing that someone on Instant Feedback suggested.  We'll get to that in a second, Jimmy, for you.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Rich on Long Island.  Rich, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know there's a village, like, I think it's in Levittown or something, 
[00:13:00]  where there's just a whole midget town, all midget houses and stuff.  I've heard about this little area.  It's in Levittown?  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  And they all decide to kind of live together in perfect harmony.  Yeah, yeah, that's what they do.  You should go see it.  Well, get some pictures for me.  All right.  Okay.  I've never had a reason to go to Levittown before, so.  Now you do.  I'll have to check that out.  Thank you, Rich. 
[00:13:30]  All right, no problem.  All right.  What are you looking at there, Jimmy?  Something's got your attention.  Yeah, man, I'm sorry.  The New York Post loves these.  Oh, I didn't realize that was the front page.  Yeah.  The S&M.  What?  Basically, what?  There was some, what?  Manhattan lawyer.  He's a star lawyer.  How do you become a star Manhattan lawyer?  You're the biggest scumbag in town?  That's great.  Star Manhattan lawyer slain in S&M Love Triangle. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, he was.  So what?  His, his, I think his lady does the S&M on the side?  Yeah.  Her name is Edith, I guess, Ma, M-A-A.  She looks Asian and part something.  She looks like she's two things.  And her fetish name was Jade Vixen.  Oh, still is.  And I never saw her.  I never met her.  But many times over the years, I saw her in ads and almost went to see her.  Wait, you know this one?  No, no, no.  I don't know her.  But you've seen her in ads? 
[00:14:30]  Many times.  Okay.  And I literally had, at times, I was tempted to book appointments to go see her because  she worked at a place, I think that that worked late.  And like, you know, especially the time when we were off the air, when I was up till four  o'clock, five o'clock in the morning, you know, just being a pervert.  Right.  And her boyfriend was shot and killed and she was kidnapped by a client, a muscle, this  42-year-old muscle guy who was obsessed with her.  It's just kind of weird to see her.  The guy looks like an animal, man, and he, yeah, he killed the husband over his, boyfriend, 
[00:15:00]  sorry, over the obsession with the dominatrix.  Yeah, so I'm just a little, I just seen this, it's like, wow, man, not that it matters, but  you know.  I hear you.  I hear you.  By the way, Jimmy, you're in Zach and Miri making porno.  I have one moment of one line.  And now that it doesn't matter anymore, we finally can play your line.  This is how stupid this whole thing is.  But we could just play your line without commenting on it.  I will say this. 
[00:15:30]  This is the, I will say this is during an audition scene for something I was just reading.  And he had me do it a bunch of different ways with a bunch of different lines.  In some, I had to deliver with a certain mentality or a certain vibe.  This one, I pretty much just delivered straight.  And, you know, like, let's go to the store and get some milk.  Yeah.  Like, he wanted me to deliver some with completely no emotion.  And here it is.  This is what made the movie.  Cradle the balls.  Break the shaft.  That's it.  King of the one line. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you're right.  King of the one line in hit movies.  Spider-Man, Zach and Miri.  But I'm a good omen.  If you give me one line, you do all the box.  Yeah, there you go.  More than one line.  Like, you put me in a series.  You're out in one season.  I knew Rich was lying.  Let's go back to Long Island.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, that guy, Rich, from Long Island.  Yeah.  Dude, he's wrong.  That midget town is in Merrick.  Oh, it's in Merrick.  It's in Merrick.  Yeah, it was crazy, dude.  One time, it was snowing.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, we just drove by, and there was a bunch of midgets shoveling snow. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  It was pretty weird.  Are we allowed to call them midgets?  I mean, we still will, but, I mean, are they telling us not to?  Nobody said that.  No, I'm not even talking about radio, just, like, in the real world.  They want to be called, like, little people.  Yeah, but then, you know what the problem is?  Little people.  But the problem with that stuff is then you start calling them little people over and  over again, and they're like, hey, stop calling us little people.  Because they have this, when there's a negative connotation to the word, like, it's almost  like, but you're right.  If you start calling them little people, they, they, Carlin said it best. 
[00:17:00]  He said, people in America think that by changing the word, you change the condition.  Right.  And, you know, you can't put it better or simpler than that.  Midget had this negative thing, so they think that by being called little people, they're  going to change perceptions, and they're going to change any of this stuff, but it doesn't  matter.  Yeah.  If you're feeling about something that's negative, saying little people and not midget is not  going to make a big difference.  Right.  At all.  Well, there you go.  It's just silly.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Anthony, what's going on, buddy?  Lady Godiva was a freedom fighter. 
[00:17:30]  That was the part that was in my head.  It wasn't even the mod part.  Dude.  It was so bad.  You completely got it stuck in my head on the way in.  I'm driving in listening to the job I'm supposed to be at, and all I'm hearing is, Lady Godiva,  and a sister who can really cook.  Ugh.  Wait.  But.  But, but, yeah.  The country was falling apart. 
[00:18:00]  Bitteross got it all sold out.  Yeah.  And then there's mod fits in with all those historical figures.  Powerful women.  Yes.  But how do you get obsessed with that?  It wasn't like an obsession like I was conscious of.  It was just, it was booming in my head.  Right.  It was nonstop.  It's a horrible thing because I could relate, because the whole way home, all I had in my  head was, we're back.  It's better than him.  We're back.  And I was douche chilling the whole drive home.  Oh, cool, because I've been working on a new one. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  You got some more lyrics?  No, but the other song, like the other song that they released, which was pretty popular,  was, it's a crazy world, and then in parentheses, but I'm a little bit crazier.  Is that an actual song?  A little bit more.  Is that an actual song they put out?  Yeah.  It's a crazy world, but I'm a little bit crazier.  It's the same song.  Of course it is.  You'll have a whole album.  I got to play this for Jimmy because of your obsession.  Oh, look, it's one of those early Maud episodes with a really long opening credit sequence. 
[00:19:00]  Brady Godiva was a freedom rider.  She didn't care if the whole world looked.  Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her.  She was a sister who really cooked.  Madame Curie was a strong woman character working all day in a science lab, yeah.  Sarah Martin was a famous nurse who was rapping with the soldiers and bandages, too. 
[00:19:30]  Susan, the enemy, always out doing stuff, marching around and holding up signs.  And then there's Maud.  Oh, go ahead.  What the hell?  What's going on?  An Indian guy with lots of Indian pride.  Indira Gandhi ran a whole big country.  That isn't easy even if you're a guy.  And then there's Maud.  Dave Zaharis was a really good athlete. 
[00:20:00]  Good at track and field and professional golf, too.  And then there's Maud.  Amelia Earhart flew on a lot of airplanes, except for that one time when she didn't come back.  Cleopatra lived way out in the desert.  And then there's Maud.  Come on!  But still found a way to keep herself looking fine.  And then there's Maud.  Ah!  Ah!  There we go.  That was an ordeal.  And that's why Seth MacFarlane was voted smartest person on TV. 
[00:20:30]  Was he really?  Hell yeah, he was.  You know what?  That is damn funny, man.  And Tina Fey was in second place because, you know, she's the it thing right now.  Got it right now.  She was also, I'll say this for Tina Fey, though.  She's a writer, too, man.  She was the head of SNL writer for us.  Oh, no, she's extremely talented.  And that 30 Rock is a great show.  No problem.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore.  Opa, don't call them midgets.  The PC term now is kickables.  Kickables.  That one will stick with the show for a while. 
[00:21:00]  Kickables.  Let's say hi to Robin, calling from Detroit, a regular.  Robin, is it cold in the day?  Robin?  Her phone froze.  No, I got a floating arrow today.  Maybe we could fix that.  Today's problem is a floating arrow.  Shake the mouse a little bit.  Sometimes that'll work.  Yeah.  If you pull it up.  Of course it won't.  Robin, what's going on?  Is it cold in the day?  It's very cold in the day.  All right.  Wasn't there a controversial show where Maude had an abortion? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  She was too old to be pregnant, though.  That's just why.  She got pregnant.  Oh.  And they had a whole discussion about her having a baby at that age and wound up, they  decided to get an abortion.  And just the word on TV back then.  Ooh.  Wait, was that the one?  Controversial.  Hold on.  It's funny.  That's one of the clips I was watching yesterday with Adrienne Barbeau was talking.  If it's the same episode.  With those big boobies of hers?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Big, delicious breasts.  Big, huge. 
[00:22:00]  Adrienne Barbeau.  Giant hands.  And her unseen child on the show.  I think she was married to, uh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  She had a child on that show, but it was always upstairs or something.  I guess they didn't want to pay a kid, uh, actor or deal with the problems of having  a child actor on set.  Yeah.  So they just always talked about it, but you rarely ever saw Adrienne Barbeau's child.  We were talking yesterday, because I had to go do that yell thing, which was good.  I'll talk about it later.  It was like that when the talk was about sitcoms.  And one of the points he raised was that the old days of sitcoms were, it kind of like 
[00:22:30]  made America, it was like people, what people wanted America to be, leave it to Beaver.  And then the 70s or whatever, it was like a mirror to America.  And I guess that's why stuff like abortion and all that stuff was, uh, all the family  or Sanford and Son, the junkyard and awful living.  Yeah.  But that was the clip I was watching.  It was Adrienne Barbeau talking about, there's no shame in it, Ma, in abortion.  It was a dirty word when you were young.  There is shame in it.  Just looking at, like, an old picture of her, she was way too old even back then.  Yeah.  I don't think she had enough female hormones to have a child.  No kidding, man.  Like mustache. 
[00:23:00]  He'll be Arthur?  Yeah.  She was great.  God's gonna get you for that, Walter.  Walter.  She was great.  What a horrid wife she would make.  Wow, look at Adrienne Barbeau.  She's got a little mini skirt.  Oh my God.  Yeah, she was, uh...  And those boobies, did she get implants or something?  Because they're luscious there, but they became a lot bigger than that.  They're battened down.  Wow.  In that dress she's wearing.  Very 70s looking dress she's wearing.  I guess you had to batten them down back in the 70s when you were on TV.  Maud looks like an art teacher wearing a smock. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, awful.  Maud had like a short skirt.  Yeah.  A short and a skirt thing, and then a long orange shirt and an even longer vest smock.  Yeah, big vest smock.  There you go.  All right, we gotta take a break.  Steven S. Bayshore, wow, kickable.  That one's gonna stay with us for a while.  It certainly will.  Just like bless bings, Will.  Call up with your favorite Maud stories.  No!  No!  We still gotta do John and Kate plus eight.  Stay there, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning to all the kickables out there.  They're a little people.  The kickables.  All right, the Knicks got their asses handed to them in Cleveland last night.  LeBron!  LeBron James, 118-82.  And this is kind of cool, sort of.  You got the Raiders and Chargers playing tonight, and they're gonna be showing this in 3D theaters  in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. 
[00:24:30]  First 3D game ever, which would be cool if it wasn't the Raiders and the Chargers.  How the hell are they pulling that off?  I don't know.  What do you got, ADD glasses?  What?  Isn't it 3D if you just go to the game?  Like, isn't that watching it in 3D?  Of course.  They're trying something new.  But why does it have to be the Raiders and the Chargers?  Why can't it be my Jets that I've been supporting all year long? 
[00:25:00]  Is it gonna be like, ooh, I got the ball?  Huh?  Ooh, is it gonna be like, ooh, the ball's coming at me?  It's coming right at you.  Ooh!  I would check that out, but you know someone's gonna get shot, so I'm gonna stay away from that.  Who are you kidding?  Something horrible's gonna go wrong.  That's a tough one.  People watching 3D football, it can't be good.  No.  And then Sean Avery, you know what?  I feel bad for Sean Avery, and I'm a huge Islander fan, but he had to apologize for that sloppy second comment. 
[00:25:30]  And he did apologize, and he still faces punishment, and he's in town to meet with the commish.  Ugh.  How did the apology go?  I don't even know.  Solemn, somber, slobbering.  I'm sorry.  No, we've been through this.  Someone writes your statement, you read it, make believe you mean it, and then you crumple up the paper like this so everyone knows you had to read something, and then you move on with your radio show or your hockey career.  These apologies don't mean crap to anybody.  No, they're...  The people saying they're sorry don't mean it. 
[00:26:00]  They're completely written out.  You're right.  Of course they are.  We've been through that a couple times.  Yep.  Don't mean it.  We're like, we don't want to apologize.  You have to.  Or you're fired.  All right, watch what we do now.  If you ever hear an apology, we never, ever mean it.  It's been forced upon us.  Absolutely.  JC, 13 years old, one of our youngins.  What's up, JC?  What's up, Bo?  How are you, buddy?  Good, you?  I'm all right, man.  I pulled up a website, and apparently with an IQ score of 140, Rich Voss is smarter than Bill Clinton. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  Benjamin Franklin.  All right, hold on.  Let's slow down a little bit.  Yeah, Rich Voss, because we all think he's probably the dumbest person on earth that hasn't been diagnosed with something.  And he said his IQ is 140, right?  Yeah.  All right, so then you went online, and you found out who he's smarter than with this 140 IQ.  So now start over there.  Sorry, JC.  Abraham Lincoln. 
[00:27:00]  Uh-huh.  Bill Gates.  Uh-huh.  George Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Um, Adolf Hitler.  Uh, Hillary Clinton, which is a no-done with those plank teeth.  Um, let's see.  Uh, I don't know.  Those are the, oh, John F. Kennedy.  Mm-hmm.  Smarter than JFK after the shot?  Yeah, really.  I can agree with that.  After those pesky brains were removed.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Those are just the prominent ones.  Yeah, well, thank you, JC.  Yeah, no one's buying into Rich Voss' smart thing.  No.  Speaking of which, uh, you have perfect timing there, JC.  Derek and Steve put together something.  Recently, uh, we had Voss looking at celebrities.  Like, it's our new bit.  It's great.  Oh.  You hold up a celebrity picture, and you go, Voss, who is this?  Okay?  And he got them all wrong, and Derek and Steve put this together.  Listen to this.  Introducing Name That Actor on the Opie and Anthony Show with your favorite non-actor, 
[00:28:00]  Rich Voss.  Yeah, hold on.  I got gum in my mouth.  And now for our first question.  All right, I'm ready.  This actor was Remington Steele and starred in several James Bond movies.  Who is it, Rich?  Uh, Pierce Bronson.  Right?  Right?  I knew he was going to say that.  What?  This actor starred opposite Heath Ledger in the controversial Brokeback Mountain.  Who are we talking about, Rich?  Oh, uh, Dillonworth. 
[00:28:30]  What?  Something.  It's got a couple names on the end of it, right?  This actor is best known for playing big parts and retards.  Who is it, Rich?  And no, it's not you.  Like Perdicci or something.  Stay tuned for another edition of Celebrity Password, only on the Opie and Anthony Show,  hopefully starring Rich Voss, because he's dumb. 
[00:29:00]  Voss, I wish we had just had a live feed into your brain so we didn't have to go through  the bulls**t of your mouth getting out the words.  Who was the last one he, uh...  There were two that were really bad.  It was Giovanni Ribisi and, um...  Jake Gyllenhaal?  Yeah, Gyllenhaal and Benicio Del Toro.  Yeah.  He, uh, he just, he is a moron.  That's a great bet.  We gotta get him back in here just to do that.  Oh, yeah.  You had something about the media, Jimmy, you were saying during the break? 
[00:29:30]  The media man!  Well, the media's gonna destroy this country.  If you talk to the boys on Wall Street, they're all saying the media has to shut the F up about  the economy.  Panic.  They're panicking everybody and most people.  I think our listeners are a little more intelligent than the average TV viewer.  They can't read between the lines.  So they're hearing all this panic on TV.  They're yanking their money out of this and they're not spending as much.  And Wall Street's basically saying to the media, shut up. 
[00:30:00]  We can figure this out.  Yeah.  But you're not helping things.  A couple of misguided and mismanaged companies screw up and go down the crapper.  Right.  And they think everything is radioactive.  Yeah.  You can't touch it.  Because they're all going for the big, you know, the big headline and it's really not  helping matters whatsoever.  I know we're in a tough spot, but certainly the media with what they're doing, what they're  just being panicky Pete's is just not good.  They make anything ten times worse. 
[00:30:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  And people don't understand that, unfortunately.  But we try to educate the people.  And I think some of you out there have gotten the lesson.  But Jimmy, what do you got in the media today?  There's such scumbags and vultures.  It's like after this girl, Jade Eviction, her real name is Edith Marr, which is just a  bizarre.  Edith.  Yeah, E-D-Y-T-H.  There's something kind of sexy about that.  After this bum shot her boyfriend and killed himself.  They get to her parents in Long Island.  And it said, when reached at his Long Island home, Ma's father said she was doing well. 
[00:31:00]  Well, she's okay, but not home, he said.  And he also added that she was not in the hospital.  When asked what his daughter did for a living, he said sorry and shut the door.  It's like, why is this scumbag reporter who knows that she's a dominatrix?  Yeah, yeah.  Why are you asking this girl's father what she does for a living?  Like, why are you trying to start that moment?  That's what you want.  He wanted that moment of, you know, go ahead. 
[00:31:30]  Here, dad.  Tell us what your little girl does.  And their excuse will be, well, she was only a part-time dom.  We all know what you were trying to get out of him.  You were trying to get the fact that his daughter, whose boyfriend was just shot,  and she was just kidnapped, was a dominatrix.  You wanted to hear these vultures.  Yeah, and that's that taboo moment of the father having to throw all of his dignity out the window  and say that his daughter is a whore.  And they were hoping for a little bit of an attack, I'm sure.  Or something, yeah.  Some kind of drama where the father goes after the reporter or something. 
[00:32:00]  It's like, why do you ask that?  Like, you already know the answer to it.  Yeah.  They're just awful.  Yeah, they are.  Hey, we got a man that, there was a gun accident there, Anthony.  Oh, damn.  This is a great story.  The man says gun accidentally went off during sex, shooting wife in chest.  Oof.  Oopsie.  And there's some other stuff in this story, right?  Whoops.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  A little accident going down. 
[00:32:30]  Inside this home on East County Line Road, medics found Carolyn Havens with a gunshot wound  on the upper part of her chest.  Also in the home, her husband, Timothy Havens, and a gun laying beside their bed.  Havens called 911 after the shooting, saying it was an accident.  Where was the gun laying beside the bed at, Tim?  It was laying beside the bed.  I picked it up and turned it off to the side.  We were having sex and it just went off.  The couple has had problems before.  Court records indicate Havens served 60 days in jail for assaulting his wife and violating 
[00:33:00]  a protection order in October.  The judge also ordered Havens to get anger management counseling.  Uh, yeah, that sounds like a little fishy.  He didn't sound that broken up during that.  What was that, a 911 call?  That was a bit relieved.  Yeah, he was like, yeah, you know, it sounded like, you know, he spilled something or broke  a vase.  Yeah, he spilled something.  Hey, you know, I threw something to the side and the vase broke. 
[00:33:30]  And they're currently in divorce proceedings and he was not supposed to be in the house  because there is an order of protection.  And they're having sex.  Yeah.  Were they actually having sex or did he kind of throw that in there?  That's what we know.  He claims they were having sex and he reached for something and the gun went off.  That's, I guess I'm 40 and a half.  That's the worst excuse I've ever had.  That is awful.  Wow.  Obviously, um, he was, uh, he meant to shoot her. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, Jesus, look at that.  Unbelievable.  Maybe he took all his clothes off so there wouldn't be any of that, you know, evidence  on your clothing.  And then, uh...  Ah, and then said we were having sex.  Yeah.  So they were having sex.  He was at the killer, like Donnie Wahlberg or was it, which, which, Donnie Wahlberg in  the beginning of The Sixth Sense?  Yeah, yeah.  Just naked and psychotic.  Naked in the bathroom.  Crying naked in the bathroom.  All emaciated.  What a sick scene.  What a sick, sick scene. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  I think I'm going senile, by the way.  Why?  Uh, because that's exactly what happened this morning.  I, I woke up...  And shot somebody?  And, uh, shot someone.  No, where are we at?  No, I was...  There's a man on your chest?  There's a man.  I was having sex with a man.  I have a protection order again.  No, I woke up and I look at the clock and, uh, it was about almost 5.30 and I wasn't panicked  at all.  I just went, okay, let me get ready.  I thought, I, the, I had the exact feeling as if it was like almost five o'clock. 
[00:35:00]  So I'm just strolling around the house getting ready and then I look at my watch and go like,  holy Jesus, the show is on in like 20 minutes.  I, I had no clue.  I absolutely thought that I had plenty of time, that it was the time I get up every  day.  And then I looked and just went, oh my God, I got 20 minutes to get in now at this hour,  which the traffic was, uh, uh, a grand. 
[00:35:30]  But then I was just like, what, what made me think that I had time?  Was there any moment where there was something wrong?  Like there's times where you're walking around like that, but there's, there's a panic somewhere  in the back.  You don't know what it is, but there's something that was like, there was nothing until I,  in the bathroom, I looked at my watch and, and I guess looking at the digital clock was  one thing.  It was like, okay, there's a number.  I, I just thought it was whatever time I get up and then looking at the watch and seeing 
[00:36:00]  the actual hands and seeing how close the little hand was to the six, I was like, Ooh,  Jiminy Cricket.  This is bad.  I was like, what am I going senile?  What's going on with you, Ant?  What?  What's going on?  That was weird.  That has never happened.  That's a weird one.  Never.  I wasn't drunk.  I wasn't anything like that.  It just was, I'm going senile.  I lost my mind.  Was it the perks?  No, it wasn't.  I didn't even take any perks.  No perks yesterday.  I still have perks in the bottle. 
[00:36:30]  You were dealing with the pain without the perks yesterday.  Just take the perks.  No perks.  Went home, took a nap.  I did everything.  And then woke up thinking, you know, looking at the clock like, bye.  It's okay.  But I needed to look at the little hand and the big hand to realize that there was an issue.  This is a hell of a ride, man.  Out of my mind.  And 877-212-ON-A if you got something for the old radio show.  Well, when the country was all torn up, Betsy Ross got it all sewn up.  She got it all sewn up. 
[00:37:00]  Do you want me to play it again?  No, no, no.  I can do that for you, Jerry.  No, that's the beginning.  It's in my head.  And you are right about the voice.  Good time.  That voice is horrid.  They were all the same song back then.  Yeah.  It sounded like the same guy.  And then there's no.  They got the backup singers from Good Times.  They shipped them over to the Maud's studio.  Exactly.  But before they had, like in the first episodes, they always had, the pilot was the one they  had to take all the clips from.  Right, right.  They didn't have a season where the episode, and it was all these wacky faces and moments 
[00:37:30]  from the pilot in the same outfit.  Hey, going back to that gunshot thing, I'm reminded Mike from Boston, he writes,  she enticed me my entire life.  Do we have that?  She enticed me.  We haven't played that in a long time.  Maybe we could sneak that in before the break.  That guy would have set on him.  This effing guy finally had it with his wife of many, many, many, many years, shot her,  had no regret, and called 911 and even said, I did it because she enticed me my entire life 
[00:38:00]  and just sat there and waited to be arrested.  Whatever happened, can we get an update on that guy?  He just sounded like an angry married guy that's been married for years and years, miserable,  and finally was just driven to kill his wife.  You know what we'll do?  We'll get the audio for after the break, and Stunt Brain, if you could, I want to see how  good you are today.  Can we get an update on that guy?  Because some of these stories we bring to the people, they just go away, and it would  be nice to get an update every once in a while. 
[00:38:30]  An update would be nice.  Look at Billy.  Billy will be on the show in a little while.  Look at Bill Burr on Picks 11.  He's becoming a big, big star, this Bill Burr.  He'll be in here.  Is he unshaven?  Yeah, it's his new look.  You know, shaved head, unshaven face.  But it's not a completely shaved head.  It's a shaved head, and then it's like two days growth.  He's got Jim Norton head.  He's looking a little bit like Jim Norton.  If I had a jawline and was in some kind of shape.  Now, Ann, you made fun of that look yesterday where the guys that are losing their hair a little 
[00:39:00]  bit, they shave their heads.  I didn't make fun of it.  Bill Burr admitted that he was losing a little bit, and he decided to shave his head, and  he looks good with the shaved head.  It's the comb over for the new millennium.  You could look good with the shaved head.  No.  See, Bill does.  Bill's got a nice jawline, you know, a fun Irish-looking guy.  Yeah.  So he's got that big Irish head.  And now he's got the goatee coming in.  That's the new look.  All right.  We'll talk to Bill Burr in a bit.  First, we'll do a little primetime gossip with Sam Roberts.  We got John and K-plus-8 phone calls coming in. 
[00:39:30]  We got the audio of the guy that was enticed by his dopey wife.  And a reason to be scared to fly after the break.  What?  Besides plummeting 30,000 feet to your death?  It's either another reason to be scared to fly, or flying is extremely safe.  You can take it either way, I'm sure.  I took four flights.  I was horrified.  I can't get over my fear of flying.  Really?  And this story certainly doesn't help me.  I'll explain next, but first this.  We're back, and Primetime Gossip is giving you all the Opie and Anthony dirt you can handle. 
[00:40:00]  After a week-long vacation, co-host Anthony came back to the show with a surprise announcement.  Over Thanksgiving vacation, I went to the medical hair restoration, and I got hair put on the top of my head where it was falling out.  That's right.  Ant decided to get medical hair restoration.  He went on to explain to the listeners, and to PTG, exactly what made him want to get this done. 
[00:40:30]  I didn't want to look at pictures of me anymore with a big glowing spot on my head.  I looked like those pictures of Jesus with a big glowing thing on my head.  Illusions of grandeur much?  The DJ with a God Complex went on to talk about the procedure in detail.  After they're done Novocaine-ing your head, they take this thing and poke thousands of holes in your head.  It's just tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, and you hear like...  As awful and uncomfortable as that sounded, it wasn't half as bad as the last time Anthony modified the hair on his face. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus, I remove any facial hair, and all of a sudden I have AIDS.  What cosmetic procedure could be next for Anthony?  Botox?  Collagen?  While we have no proof, we will confirm that a gastric bypass and tummy tuck is around the kumia corner.  Stay tuned, as PTG keeps you in the know.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to say hi to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:41:30]  How you doing?  Hey, man.  How are you?  Hey, man.  I am depressed.  What?  You guys came back from vacation and then didn't come back from vacation.  Yeah, we didn't know that was going to happen.  We never got the heads up.  Dude, that sucks.  We'll try to pop up again somewhere else in Boston, that's for sure.  Well, I mean, for the longest time, I'm a third shifter, so I stopped my route probably about five hours before you guys even come on.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  So I was always right on the mark as soon as you came on.  And then right about the time I got into another state and I lost your reception, the show would go over to Satellite anyways.  Then what happened?  I was always thinking about making the switch, you know?  Well, just get the Satellite Radio and you can continue listening to this fine program.  I'm definitely going to have to.  I just had to go on, though, so money's kind of tight.  You understand, you know?  Yeah, I understand that.  These days?  Why?  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  We don't have disposable income anymore? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  I spend hundreds of dollars willy-nilly.  I just toss it around.  Lighting cigars with them and going, ha, ha, ha, rum.  I was talking to a cab driver.  Yeah, go ahead, John.  Oh, I'm sorry, man, because I have a regular guy, a cab driver that will come pick me up once in a while.  He's a fan of the show.  That's smart.  Not the type of guy you'd think would be a fan of the show.  It's amazing you think you know our demographic, and a lot of times you're right.  Black guy?  No, no, no, I forget.  The black cab drivers love this radio show.  I can't tell you how many times a black cab driver goes, 
[00:43:00]  Wow, I listen to you guys every morning.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, but I interrupted you.  But no, no, it's like a lot of times you think you know the demo, and you don't.  Like, the guy, I don't want to say what nationalities, I don't know.  One of those you can't figure out.  I don't know.  He's told me, and I forget.  I think his name is Awan, A-W-A-N, or A-W-O-N.  I'm a big fan of the show.  And he was just talking.  I'm like, where you been, man?  He's like, man, there's like 30% to 40% less people taking cabs.  No one's taking cabs anymore. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, really?  Everybody is just taking in the face.  That's why they're battling out there.  Yeah, that's what he said.  He goes, everybody's fighting over the same fares,  because it's almost half people not taking cabs.  So a lot more people are hitting the subways and the buses.  Yeah, walking or whatever it is they've got to do.  The Christmas tree industry is taking a big hit.  Are they?  Apparently, the live Christmas trees, no one's, not no one,  but there's like 15% off their 15% off of their business from last year.  Well, I have one, actually, that I was going to buy,  and somebody took it, and they lit it last night. 
[00:44:00]  I'm so irritated.  I had it.  They were keeping it for me.  Boo.  At 54th Rocket Fire Center.  Boo.  I was trying to make the joke that that's my tree.  Keeping it local.  Yeah, sure am.  Yeah, keeping the joke local in your own head.  Yeah, exactly, in a room by myself, hearing my own non-lap echo.  And then there's Bum.  Stupid Maude.  I obsess with Maude, my God.  God, I love me, Arthur.  Hey, so, oh, we have the audio of that guy? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  The Entice Me guy?  Yeah.  We've got to play this just because it was referenced today.  It's one of our favorite stories.  This guy just had it with his wife for many, many years and shot her and killed her,  and then decided to call 911 and tell the fine people what he did.  And just the casualness of the whole thing is just amazing.  Here's how it went down.  This is Freddie Will.  Hi.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  Is she still there? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, she's laying on the floor.  Why did he do this?  She enticed me, and she was ridiculed me throughout my lifetime.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  She's alive.  She's dead.  Oh, she enticed me.  You could hear it all summed up in that one line, that whole marriage.  She enticed me. 
[00:45:30]  What did he say at the end?  Did he say?  She's dead.  He goes, are you alive?  Or are you dead?  And the part we didn't play, then he comes back to the phone and goes, yep, she's dead.  I think she's dead.  For some reason, there's a long version and a short version.  That was the short version.  The long one's like over two minutes.  Oh, it's all right.  Yeah, we just wanted a little taste of that.  She enticed me.  And we got an update on that guy.  So after a year and a half, what happened to him?  He was sentenced and found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison this summer. 
[00:46:00]  He will be eligible for parole in 15 years, and he is almost 70.  So he'll be 85 when he gets shot.  That sucks, man.  She could have enticed him his entire life.  You got to get some kind of confession before you shoot these broads.  Get a camera rolling going, look, did you or did you not entice me my entire life?  Maybe it helps you a little bit.  Gets you a few years off your sentence.  Get out of prison.  Carve his name in a beam.  And hang himself.  I just can't take it anymore.  Stupid Brooks. 
[00:46:30]  He's probably trying to spin it like, look, if I live to be 100, the next 15 out of 30,  I'll do here if I don't have to deal with that bitch.  Yeah.  85 up.  She enticed me, and my hands hurt sometimes when I work at the foodway.  She must have been a real you-don't-what, because now, you know, he's in prison getting  it in the pooper.  He'd rather take it in the pooper than live with her anymore.  I run the prison library.  He's dumb Brooks.  And Brooks' prison library stunk. 
[00:47:00]  He was there from 1905, and he was responsible for the prison library at Shawshank, and it  stunk.  And then Dufresne came in.  Dufresne came in and, like, wrecked his whole bit.  His whole gig was just, you know, throwing some books on a cart and wheeling them down  the prison aisles.  Here's Louis L'Amour.  Here's to magazines, time, and life.  They weren't even organized.  So you got your National Geographic.  Geographic over here.  And then Dufresne, like, fixes it up into a library any city would love to have. 
[00:47:30]  Actually institutes the Dewey Decimal System.  Yeah, yeah.  Stupid Brooks.  Go hang yourself, you old feeble-minded douche.  Brooks was here.  Good.  Don't dangle, you idiot.  If I was a library guy, I would just rip out the last ten pages of every single book  in the library without telling anyone.  All the convicts.  Every book.  The best prison story ever was Billy Connolly, the comedian.  You guys know Billy Connolly.  When he was in it, he said that in Scotland or whatever, I think he said in jail what they 
[00:48:00]  do is when it's a mystery, they circle the name of the guy who did it throughout the  entire book.  That's the way to go.  That's even better.  That's even better.  One of those dumb John Grisham novels where they try to trick you the entire book.  He'll just circle the name.  He'll just circle the name every time it comes up in the book.  Well, they're prisoners. 
[00:48:30]  Of course, they're asses.  They can't live without robbing or murdering somebody.  That's a funny gag.  Yeah, take the pleasure out of something like reading.  Is that hilarious?  So they can just shank people instead.  That's one of the better ones I've heard.  Billy Connolly makes me laugh.  Well, so I took four flights over the vacation we all had.  Four?  Yeah, I couldn't get a nonstop.  Take any of them old guys?  No, no little guys.  And I just hate flying.  And now there's a story that comes out today, and I'm not sure if this would help me or horrify 
[00:49:00]  me even more, I guess.  I will say, I don't know what story you're talking about, but it's probably something to  do with a near miss or some mishap on a plane.  No near miss.  The economy being so crappy that maintenance is there.  Dude, that's exactly what I was thinking about when I was flying.  I'm like, all right, we're not stupid.  The economy's falling apart, and we're all kind of like trying to cut corners in our  spending and what not, and we know what the company's doing here. 
[00:49:30]  That's what I was thinking.  I'm like, okay, if the radio world blows because of the economy and they're getting rid of everybody,  you've got to think the airline industry is like, ah, do we really need all these mechanics?  Do we really need...  He's a mechanic for the whole, for all the airline.  He just goes around to the airports and fixes whatever's broken.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  I'm like, wow, they probably can't afford their people, just like radio can't afford their  people, so what the hell are they not checking on the plane before this takes off? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  That was my fear this time.  Absolutely.  But this story, well, tell me what you think.  You want to guess?  It's not a near miss.  And you went with the economy.  That's a very good guess.  I went with the economy and mechanics.  Other than that, I don't know.  Dude, and the other thing I forgot to tell you, I had a four-hour layover in Miami, and  we're sitting on the plane for easily 45 minutes, plane ready to go.  And then the stewardess or the flight attendant or whatever the hell they like to be called 
[00:50:30]  these days, they get on the PA and go, oh, we're just waiting for the pilots.  And I'm sitting there on the plane going, they haven't even, they're not even in the  cockpit checking all their instruments yet?  From the bar.  Because doesn't that make you feel good when you walk on the plane, and there they are  in the cockpit?  Even if they're not doing anything, they're like, okay.  Check.  Check.  They're sitting there getting prepared for your, you know, four-hour flight.  Yeah.  Oh, we're just waiting for the pilots.  And, you know, I'm lucky enough to be in first class, so I hear the pilot come on and 
[00:51:00]  go, sorry, we're late, but we had to wait for our takeout bags.  They were eating in between flights, and you would think the waitress would, like, you  know, take care of the pilots so they could get on their plane early and check the instruments.  It's like, probably like me this morning, jumping into the car, starting it, throwing  it in reverse and just going.  Yeah.  Because, like, ah, I'm late.  Right.  They didn't brush their teeth.  They're all just.  Just run to your car.  Pilot bag, all filthy.  Yeah, so they got their takeout bag, and they go into the cockpit, and 10 minutes later, 
[00:51:30]  we're backing up.  I'm like, oh, this is going to make for a pleasant flight.  Like, what kind of systems check could they have done?  Yeah.  Whatever.  I like to know they're sitting there when I get on the plane.  I don't like to be on the plane first.  And a good pilot does a walk around of his aircraft.  Yes.  Checks out, looks with the flashlight, looks in the engines.  Oh, yeah.  For whatever it's worth.  Yeah, I'm sure.  On a plane that size, they're supposed to walk around, check all the little pit of tubes,  make sure they're not clogged, make sure all the safety devices are pulled off of certain  things. 
[00:52:00]  And I guess they didn't do that, because they were a little hungry.  And I like to see the young bucks, because the guy that walked on this plane, I'm like,  ah, he could easily have a heart attack in the air.  That's my other thing.  Do you want to see the young bucks, or do you want to see the experienced fighter pilots?  This guy walked on, and he had a red face, and it wasn't because he was in the sun  too long.  Oh, really?  I'm like, great.  This guy's got a nice blood pressure rolling.  That's a little creepy.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to see the young, like, early 30s.  That's about the age.  Not too young. 
[00:52:30]  Not too old.  I want to see a seasoned guy, probably in his late 40s, early 50s, has fighter experience,  been shot at.  Hell no.  Like, I like a pilot that's landed his plane with half a wing.  I understand all that, but these guys look like they could have a heart attack at any  moment.  I don't want them flying the damn plane.  Well, the older guys look at the commercial piloting as like, ah, this is just pussy nonsense.  It's just so easy.  It's so old hat when you're not being shot.  Those are the guys you want who have combat experience.  I've done this run while being shot at and zigzagging through flack. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Having to drop bombs.  This is nothing.  Bunch of you retards.  Bunch of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, here's the story.  I don't know if this makes me feel good or whatever, but here it is.  From the runway to the sky, this flight is like most others.  Flying the pattern is a breeze, the landing smooth.  The only thing that's different, the pilot in command of this air coupe is a... 
[00:53:30]  Is a what?  Is a what?  I'm going to just randomly off the top of my head.  Is a what?  I'm just going to say double amputee.  Homosexual?  Is a breeze, the landing smooth.  The only thing that's different, the pilot in command of this air coupe is a 25-year-old woman without arms.  Hey, look!  Amazing!  I got it!  Dude, stop cheating.  Did somebody tell you?  No. 
[00:54:00]  Of course it is.  No one told me.  One of his pal talk friends.  How about you play along a little bit?  It wasn't.  I just saw this story on the news last night.  So, until I heard the propeller, and this woman has, because I was horrified at the thought of it, too.  Yeah.  So, does that...  What the hell?  So, is flying...  My question is, is flying that safe where now they're like, yeah, of course you can fly.  Anyone can fly this.  Do it with your feet.  Or should I be horrified?  Like, if there's a problem, you're going to take the wheel with your tongue, or whatever the hell it is, the... 
[00:54:30]  What is it?  The stick.  The stick.  The yoke.  I believe they call it the yoke.  How is she flying?  A double amputee is flying a plane.  How does she do it?  Well, we'll find out, I guess.  I bet you she can't do three push-ups, though.  Fix her rotten wagon.  This air coop is a 25-year-old woman without arms.  A lot of people maybe have doubted me, or don't believe that a girl without arms can... 
[00:55:00]  Or a woman without arms can do much.  Yeah, sorry we doubt you, but you have no arms.  You're over our heads.  My problem is that she's the woman pilot.  I don't care about the arms.  The gender that Bryce makes it.  Look at her.  Maybe we could put this up on onaradio.com, but no arms.  You know what my favorite part of this screenshot is?  It has her name, and you know how sometimes they'll have a title under your name?  Yeah.  You know, like Anthony Cooney, a radio host.  It just says Jessica Cox, and then under it, has no arms. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Could these not...  Her name could have been Jessica Arms.  Lonely girl.  Nice.  But she can.  Jessica Cox, a certified pilot, does it all and alone, even her pre-flight inspection.  It's full.  She checks the oil with a screwdriver, her foot, and head, and fills out her own logbook. 
[00:56:00]  All right, she was using a screwdriver with her toes.  Look at this.  Heartbeat.  She's using a screwdriver with her toes, and she's writing in her logbook with her toes.  No one wants to read it.  Nasty foot stuff.  F, man.  It just smells.  Oh, smelly logbook.  Yeah.  Logbook stinks.  Stick to jump roping.  What are you doing?  How could she jump rope?  She had a hard time doing that.  No, she's the jumper.  She doesn't have to do the twirly thing. 
[00:56:30]  Okay, so here is the second.  Really?  The only tricky part?  Yeah.  This was my first challenge in flight training was how to buckle the seatbelt.  So I figured out, well, you don't always have to buckle the seatbelt after you sit down.  Oh, so she buckles it first and then slides into the seatbelt.  She's flying a plane, for God's sake.  She's insane.  She could be over your head as we speak.  Does she have a co-pilot, though?  Hell no.  She did it all by herself, Jimmy.  Wow.  She goes alone up in that plane and, I guess, steers with her foot and works the throttle with her foot. 
[00:57:00]  But then how do you do other things if you need to make a maneuver while you have to maybe operate the radio?  How are you doing that?  She does it with her toes.  You need a third appendage, though.  Can you use your toes?  She could use her toes.  What if you have to work the yoke and the throttle at the same time you have to radio something?  She uses her toes.  Like you would use your hands.  She must have something with her knee or something.  And then what about the rudder? 
[00:57:30]  You work the rudder with your feet.  You have to work the rudder pedal with your feet.  So then how does she work that?  I don't know.  Here's the second half of the story.  Maybe it's her plane has that.  Born with a congenital birth defect, she's accepted who she is.  For 11 years, she used prosthetic arms, then decided she didn't need them.  And three years ago, a pilot with Wright Flight and Aviation Company offered her the chance to fly.  Well, when she came in here, we knew she would be able to do it just because of the drive that she has, absolutely. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, Parrish, you know, he has this undying faith in me.  She's already logged close to 100 hours in the sky.  When you're behind the yoke and you're soloing the airplane for the first time and you look over and you don't see your instructor there and you're forced to accept that you're flying the airplane, you realize at that moment that you literally have your life in your own hands or, in my case, in my own feet.  Oh, we got it.  We got it.  A foot joke.  Old aircraft, she's flying there. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, my God.  And, you know, it's great because we're watching the video of this.  No one was brave enough to go up in the plane with her.  All the shots are of the plane way up in the sky.  Hey, you solo.  Right.  Usually, the reporter would go, ah, what the hell?  I'll go up with you.  Mind if I mount a camera in the cockpit with you?  Yeah, no, it'll just be on the whole time.  Don't pay any attention to it.  I don't want to distract you.  She was steering it with her feet.  You figure that everything is hooked up differently, but she was actually using the same steering wheel as another pilot would use. 
[00:59:00]  It's not specially built.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse.  By the way, they called you a Red Baron, but for different reasons.  All right, go ahead, Jesse.  Jesse.  Hey.  Oh, congratulations.  I just wanted to give you and your wife my blessings.  But I also wanted to know, when this chick's, like, checking the air pressure on the tire,  what, does she bang her head on it like a woodpecker pecking into a tree to see if it's inflated?  Yeah, she can't risk hurting her foot by kicking the tires. 
[00:59:30]  Very good.  So, that creeps me out.  But she looks like she does a pretty good job.  Her legs really bend in a strange way.  She could really bend that knee all the way back.  Well, she's never...  She's got to be able to, I guess, take care of the dirty business after she goes.  She doesn't know any better.  She hasn't had arms her whole life.  But how does she do that?  It looks like she can, just the way she's steering that plane, she can bend that knee back really far.  Look at that ridiculous picture. 
[01:00:00]  Never take a picture like that if you have no arms.  It's almost like a glamour shot.  It's one of those old school photo backgrounds.  She's wearing a smart businesswoman's jacket.  And her hair is done impeccably.  She's smiling, has her librarian-type glasses on.  She's pretty.  Nice tan.  Good teeth.  She's pretty.  And no arms!  It's just the freakiest looking picture.  And she's blessed with big boobs, so it looks like she's just hugging herself all the time. 
[01:00:30]  How much do you love yourself?  Stop hugging yourself.  She looks at the front of the ship.  Yeah.  Right.  An old Viking ship.  Oh, my God.  You know, you think they'll ever figure out the fake arm thing in our lifetime?  They got the fake leg thing down.  The old spatula foot?  Where they got the little springy things that they run on?  They, I mean, when you see these guys walking with the fake legs, it's amazing now. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Magic legs.  You can't even tell.  You know?  Yeah, they got those spatula feet, fake legs for the runners.  All that stuff.  And they got these prosthetic feet that look like real legs and stuff like that.  And it is weird when you see them with those titanium pole legs.  Like, say that someone lost their legs at the knees.  And then they got these titanium poles that are really thin, like broom handle thin.  And they go down to these little spatula feet.  And they wear regular pants. 
[01:01:30]  But when the wind blows, it's like, and the cuff of the pants wrap around that little pole.  And you go like, whoa, that looks freaky.  Like Lieutenant Dan legs.  Yes, Lieutenant Dan legs.  But they got that figured out.  The arms, though.  Well, the arms.  With the dumb hawking, they can't figure it out.  You're doing a lot with your arms.  They're starting to, right?  Yeah, yeah.  These Desert Storm or the Iraq guys coming back now, they're starting to use, like, thought.  They're starting to move their fingers.  Yeah, they're tying it into the, they're tying electrodes into the actual nerves that moved your hands in the first place. 
[01:02:00]  So you're able to actually move your hand by thinking of moving your hand.  And it's becoming more natural.  I hope.  And they don't look as ghoulish as they used to.  They're kind of getting better.  It's weird.  It's a fine line, I guess, between being aesthetically nice and functional.  But they're kind of getting there.  We've come a long way since Roy Munson.  Good old Roy Munson.  All the Kingpin fans out there. 
[01:02:30]  Beep, whop, boop.  I am a robot arm.  Bill Burr's here.  We'll do a quick break and we'll continue with Bill Burr.  We got John and Kate Plus 8 audio.  Sam interviewed Kate from John and Kate Plus 8 and said she's not a pleasant woman.  She doesn't look it.  Huh?  She doesn't look it.  No.  That show, what a bitch.  We'll see if Bill Burr's into this John and Kate Plus 8 thing.  And also, we're going to get Bill's take on Maude.  No, we're not.  Of course. 
[01:03:00]  No, no, no.  You know, Lady Diva was a freedom, or no, no, she wasn't a freedom fighter.  She, what did she do?  I don't know what that bitch did.  Let's find out.  Oh, she was a freedom fighter.  She didn't care.  Jonah Barr.  Lord to guide her. 
[01:03:30]  They must have been writing this, John.  This is great.  What did the first lady, she was a freedom fighter who what?  Didn't care if the whole world looked.  Oh, look.  Yeah, she was naked.  Lady Godiva rode her horse naked.  Oh, the whole world looked.  I thought it said the whole world cooked.  No.  It was cooked twice, because then someone cooks later.  Oh, she's a cook.  Okay.  Quick break.  Bill Burr joins the program next. 
[01:04:00]  We're very happy.  Our old friend, who now lives in L.A., but he comes back from time to time, is in studio.  Bill Burr on the Opie and Anthony show.  We were kind of catching up in the office.  Talking about Biggest Loser, Johnny K Plus 8.  What else?  Nutrisystem.  The perfect push-up and guns.  So, we got a full plate for you, Bill.  How are you?  How come I can't hear myself?  There we go.  You bought the perfect push-up? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I did.  I got the perfect push-up.  I actually got to admit, it is a little bit harder.  It's a nightmare.  To twist yourself.  It's those things that twist your arms as you're doing your push-up.  Yeah, it makes you realize that you're cheating when you do regular push-ups.  Like, you're getting nothing done.  Because with the perfect push-up, they're on these rotating things.  And when you go down, you naturally, like, rotate.  And it makes it a lot harder to do push-ups.  Plus, I really bought them because I'm so old, my wrists can't handle me doing that anymore.  I'd be going down like, eh. 
[01:05:00]  It's actually, it's assisted.  You know what's funny is the handles are the same, you know, shape.  It's like a walker.  Yeah.  So, I'm basically inching my way towards that.  I'll have nice pecs, though.  You make a really good point because when you get older like we are,  and you try to stay in shape in the gym, the joints, just doing sets, your joints just ache.  Oh, they're killing it.  I wake up now.  I have to, like, when I get up in the morning to take, you know, the morning whiz,  like, literally my ankles.  I feel like Dan Marino. 
[01:05:30]  I'm like, dude, did I play in the NFL?  I'm a comedian.  What happened to me?  And literally, he, like, caps are all.  I got to, like, stop.  You're getting hip replacement surgery already from all the time on the comedy stage.  Oh, I lean on the wall when I relieve myself now.  It's literally just trying to hold myself up.  It's brutal.  You ever have to go through your mind and try to figure out why something hurts?  Oh.  Because you want to rule out, like, a disease or bone cancer or something.  So you're like, why does my leg hurt?  And then you're like, oh, that's right.  I brought in some groceries yesterday. 
[01:06:00]  And it's just some stupid thing that you did and realized that was enough of a workout to conjure up some muscle pain.  Oh, yeah.  I bought a gallon of water.  And evidently, I inhaled at the wrong time when I switched the water from one hand to another.  And I just felt this nerve pain start somewhere in the upper mid part of my back.  And then I'm literally, like, hanging from the door jam trying to undo it.  My girl's like, what happened?  I pulled something.  I switched the gallon of water from the right hand to the left hand.  That was brutal. 
[01:06:30]  You used to be able to juggle with that, and you'd have no problem.  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Hey, where are you going to be, Bill?  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend, Thursday through Sunday.  If you saw my special, I wrote a brand new hour of stuff.  Oh, good.  I love guys like you.  Trying to keep up with the prolific Jimmy Norton over there.  I'm sounding like a broken record, but I've got to say for you guys, there's only a handful of guys like Bill, Jimmy, Louis C.K.,  and a few others that do the show that are constantly working on new material.  Some of these guys, they leave town, they come back six months later, and they're doing the exact same set, 
[01:07:00]  and they're wondering why they're not getting discovered or going anywhere in their careers.  Well, I would say, Jimmy and Louis are setting the bar.  Good.  I think I'm an hour behind you.  No, Louis is on his 11th hour, which he just shoots himself.  Louis is like, I'm doing 90 minutes now.  I'm like, how?  But see, the comedy is amazing, and it's all good.  But for the comedy fan out there, the guys that don't work on new material are kind of wrecking it for guys like yourself. 
[01:07:30]  Some people are like, I'm not going to see Jimmy or Billy because I've seen their stuff already.  No, you haven't.  You guys are working on a new hour, what, twice a year?  No, no.  Every year.  Every month, something like that?  Every year, okay.  And then you've got like that four months before the special comes out where you're frantically.  I found trying to read, you know, doing a half hour, that's no big deal over the summer to try to come up with like a new 20, 30 that you're halfway happy with.  But like when you've got like an hour coming out, that is definitely a sprint. 
[01:08:00]  You're starting to tell stories.  And my uncle was crazy.  You're trying to fill up that 45, you're telling the middle to do, yeah, do 30, do 35.  That's cool.  We've talked about it on the show.  When we're having a slow show, we start admitting all sorts of crazy stuff.  Like, why am I admitting this?  That's when all the stuff comes out.  Why don't we just play Free Bird and go home early?  I don't want to tell people this.  When you're out of wacky news clips, it all boils down to, well, I was touched.  I think that's where the hair restoration thing happened.  I don't think you were going to tell anybody, but it might have been a slow show. 
[01:08:30]  And it goes, what the hell?  I'll tell her when I did a little something, something with my hair.  Yeah, yeah.  I figured I would blurt that out.  No, it was kind of hard to come in and wear a hanky on my head.  I look like Chloe from Fight Club.  And I have pornographic materials and poppers.  I just want to have sex one last time.  He didn't want to go with the shaved head, so he did a little something, something up top.  Yeah, those are the options.  I love that. 
[01:09:00]  I moved to L.A.  You say, I'm going to be a big phony.  And I come back and you're getting the plugs.  No, they're not plugs.  Hey, how soon before you do the commercial where you step out of the pool and just shake off your mane?  They're trying to make it sound cooler, Bill.  It's hair restoration now.  They don't call it plugs.  What is the difference?  Plugs where they took this giant cookie cutter and gouged out chunks of hair from the back.  Yeah.  And then gouged out a chunk of your scalp and traded places. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they did that.  So you'd have these big lumps of hair growing out of your head that looked like plugs.  Yeah, and they would literally, and it all looked good, but like the front line soldiers, those Saving Private Ryan hairs in the front, they just looked like they took your grandmother's sewing the needle point.  They stitched it in.  They just stitched it in.  They were never able to figure that one out.  The front of the hair always gave it away.  Yeah, you've got to have bangs.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you couldn't brush your hair back or anything like that. 
[01:10:00]  Now they take individual hair follicles.  It's individual.  Each one is placed in your head, like in the direction your hair grows and everything.  So it's not like a clump of 50 hairs at a clip.  They take like thousands of hairs and separately put them in your head like an artist at work.  And they pop them in your head.  Don't slap it at you.  An artist.  It works.  It's amazing. 
[01:10:30]  Each hair is finely selected.  Finely selected.  From the finest forest at the back of your head.  Yes.  Harvested from the best place, the back of your head.  And since you can't see it, hopefully they just put them in like in the shape of a penis.  Some kind of practical joke.  Yeah, we like pulling gags on people.  Right.  Yeah, do they give you the option to like switch your part?  Like do you want to switch the part in your head?  You know, from this side to the other.  I wonder if they could do that.  It's like, yeah, you know, I want to switch this around.  Get the magician haircut from the 20s where it's like right down the middle. 
[01:11:00]  Down the middle.  You look like you actually still own some gold.  Can I have the Harry Houdini that will own some gold?  Wow.  With a handlebar mustache.  That's strong.  I want to be a weightlifter in a circus.  I got a peak yesterday.  It looks good, I got to say.  I was prepared to beat him up over it, but it looks pretty good back there.  It's just got to grow in.  You know, I got the front at these little.  Please, please put it down.  I know, it's already in the back.  What's the matter?  You look like you're going to go clean someone's apartment.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, the bandana thing is creeping us all out. 
[01:11:30]  That is horrible, but it's all I can do.  When do you get rid of the bandana?  It's Chloe.  Yeah.  She looks like a video game.  When do you get rid of the bandana?  What do you get rid of the bandana?  I guess.  In the new year, hopefully?  Once Friday, tomorrow, I get the stitches taken out from the donor area.  Yeah.  And that's why the hat hurts, because the back of the hat band rubs right on where the stitches are.  Oh, okay.  And it hurts.  So you'll be back to a hat soon, hopefully.  So, yeah.  I'll be able to wear that. 
[01:12:00]  And then we can finally look at you again.  Yeah, I know.  You won't have to look at this stupid bandana.  I know.  It's awful.  I know.  It's terrible.  You know what it is?  It's loose.  Yeah.  It's very loose.  It's much to lose.  It has to be, because tight, it winds up hurting, because the knot to the bandana is right  where the goddamn stitches are, too.  Everything seems to be there.  My pillow, when I lay down in bed, right where the goddamn stitches are.  You know, they don't show this part.  They don't show this part of the hair restoration thing.  They go right to their hair looking great.  It's the smiling guy with the girl riding a horse.  Yeah.  And jumping out of the pool, skydiving.  It's not me trying to sleep going, ow! 
[01:12:30]  Ow!  I put my head around, I'm tucking rolled up towels under my neck, so I don't have to  lay the back of my head on a pillow.  I got a bandana question for you, because not in recent years, but over the years, every  once in a while, I'm like, you know what?  I think I might want to try the bandana look, right?  Yeah.  And you see them in the stores, all the different colors and stuff.  Have you checked with the homies to make sure you're not doing anything stupid here  with the bandana color?  This is an obvious crip color.  So it is.  This is the notorious blue crip bandana. 
[01:13:00]  Instead, the red one is a blood bandana.  So why don't you go with the neutral, what's the neutral color?  Which bandana are we allowed to wear without getting shot off?  Any color.  Pink.  I don't know.  Is it 42nd Street's the cutoff, right?  Like, you've got to know whether you should be north or south of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Here in New York.  So you might have a dangerous bandana on your head.  I would have checked.  Do you want the homies to call in and let you know?  You look like you killed someone in 78 and you just got out. 
[01:13:30]  I've got to get a tattoo of a teardrop on my arm.  He did all his time.  He never ratted on anybody.  Over a crank sale.  This looked like an extra from Longest Yard or something.  Yeah, I did my time like a man.  We'll get some of those.  He's just going to decide out of the blue.  We'll get the homies to call to make sure you're safe and where you're safe with that bandana color.  I don't think the Crips of the Bloods would look at Ant and think that he's a member or a rival member. 
[01:14:00]  I'm in their turf.  Yeah.  I'm not wandering into Bloods' turf either with my Crips color.  So I don't think I have to worry about that.  All right.  People wear red bandanas around here and blue.  What are you going to do?  I think if you're a black guy, you get more of an issue because they think you could be a member of the other.  I always said the other club, the other gang, but you, no one would think you are.  He's kind of got a little Latino look about him.  Maybe that's true.  He does.  He's got that Jim Croce mustache.  Mustache.  Jim Croce mustache. 
[01:14:30]  I've been trying to shave it a little.  I've been trying to shave the top a little more, and then I take the electric razor and really get it down and try to make it a little thinner.  It's very Nicaraguan.  I don't want a Gomez Adams, but I don't want a Groucho Marx.  But it's very hard to groom a mustache so it doesn't look big and, yeah, very Hispanic fatherly looking.  So you're chopping it down now, too?  Yeah, yeah.  On the side.  You can't really put it on his head.  Right.  They're taking his mustache hair out. 
[01:15:00]  They're selecting the finest whiskers from his face.  The finest mustache hair.  So does this creep you out, Bill?  What?  The look he's got going.  Well.  The hair restoration.  No, I've seen guys.  He calls it hair restoration.  I've seen guys go through this stuff.  And does it look good in the end?  No, it's just weird.  It's weird for a little bit, and then you just kind of forget.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't think about it.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a ton of guys.  You see movie stars who are totally going, and then they're not.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  When the next movie comes out, they look like they're 18 again.  But in L.A., can you tell the guys that are getting this done? 
[01:15:30]  You know what I noticed in L.A. is that only good-looking people get plastic surgery.  Yeah.  That's what I'm kind of like.  Anybody who has the face yanked and everything, you can tell they used to look good-looking,  and now their face just looks really shiny.  They look like they just got over the worst ass-kicking ever.  Their faces are all messed up.  But ugly people, you know what I mean?  Like, the people who should get plastic surgery, like a Steve Buscemi, those guys that just  like, I think because there's no pressure when you were never really good-looking. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We're like good-looking people.  Like, you know, when you go back to your high school reunion, no one cares about me.  I was just one of those, you know, guys in the middle of the school of fish.  Yeah, no one cared.  But like, you look at the cheerleaders, the popular guys, you know, like, you know.  No one ever says, like, wow, Paul Giamatti, wow, that guy got old.  Yeah.  He really fell off.  It's more like, you know, like Tanya Katane.  Have you seen her on the show?  Oh, my God.  Celebrity Rehab.  Horrid.  We haven't talked about it much on this show, but what an awesome show.  If you look at the old Whitesnake video of her on the hood of the car and everything, 
[01:16:30]  it's amazing.  And then now.  That was the hottest video out of all those hair metal videos.  Yes.  Oh, absolutely.  I was once with her in that white dress dancing at the foot of that bed.  It was insane.  What happens with the plastic surgery?  You know, people do a little something-something, and you don't really notice.  And then they cross the plastic surgery line.  Yep.  Tawny Katane did it.  And know who just crossed the line recently?  Not that any of our listeners care, but look at Madonna.  She crossed the plastic surgery line. 
[01:17:00]  She's starting to look like one of those cat women now.  Yeah.  Well, what it is, you know, it gets to that point, I don't care what age you are, you  got to put some clothes on.  Even if you're shredded, it's like you're 50.  Oh, you look great for 50.  You know what?  That's the thing about it is, like, I don't know, whatever happened to light, like, elegance  is gone.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's just like, you know, the new elegance is you dress like a whore.  Yeah.  No matter how old you are, you try to get in shape, and still, the arms aren't right.  Well, it's the ligaments.  Yeah, all you're seeing is ligaments. 
[01:17:30]  Elasticity is kind of gone.  In the skin.  If Madonna would wear, like, a really classy dress, she would look unbelievable for her  age, but she's still wearing that, you know, muff-shaved, whatever, leotard that she's  wearing.  It's like, dude, you're 50.  The pointy highway cone bras and jumping out on stage.  Stripper body makeup to hide these spiderweb varicose veins.  I mean, there's just no way.  I don't care if you're doing yoga.  I don't care.  You're still blowing out those blood vessels. 
[01:18:00]  You're 50.  It's time to cover up the hoo-ha, sweetie.  If you go the other way, we were talking about Biggest Loser in the office.  I didn't know you were a fan of that show.  I actually, my girlfriend watches it all the time.  I take a peek at that.  I take a peek at Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  No, but I don't know if this season's as bad, but last season, I had to tap out, where  it was just like, I can't watch it.  Explain it for these guys, because I don't think Jimmy Aran look at Biggest Loser.  But my thing, well, the reason why I stopped watching the show is like, I was just so sick  of watching obese people cry on TV. 
[01:18:30]  It's just one of the most unsympathetic things ever.  Oh, yeah.  And they play sad music, like, I'm going to get emotional, and I'm going to start crying  because some dude can't stop eating cookies.  It's like, didn't I get a school collapse on a bunch of kids in China?  Right.  Some guy dies senselessly in Walmart, and this guy, cookies taste so good.  I eat one, I can't stop.  Like, you know, put 20 starving people in a house, I'll cry for them, but you know.  This fat bastard.  Yeah.  Live in a level of sloth that only, like, Slash can relate to. 
[01:19:00]  But they don't tell you with this Biggest Loser, they're just using these people.  They're just completely using them for ratings because they have a gym that they're working  out 24 hours a day.  They got someone watching every bite they throw in their fat faces.  Oh, they're finished the second they look at that show.  Oh, yeah, and then the show's over.  They're like, all right, well, take care.  Good luck to you.  And they go back to working 60 hours a week.  They got four kids to feed.  It's impossible.  That's a great documentary.  They're just watching, like, their eyes tearing up as they're driving by Wendy's. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Trying to fight it.  And not go back to their old life.  It's so easy to do it when you're on this farm they put you on out there in L.A.  But when you're driving past all those fast food places.  Yeah.  Most of them.  Calling your name.  Most of them end up gaining most of the weight, if not more, after they leave the show.  But they don't want to acknowledge those people.  They make believe they never existed.  That's when I get into fights with my girls, because I always do that.  When they sit there and they're like, you know, and the people get kicked off because they couldn't, you know, spin a hula hoop for like nine minutes or whatever the hell they lost to the competition. 
[01:20:00]  All the fat competitions that make them do it.  Yeah.  And they're like, I don't regret this.  I really feel like I've made a change.  Yeah.  And I just sit there, yeah, I'm going to be fat again.  Absolutely.  A very small percentage learn the lesson and figure out how to make it work, you know, in their regular lives.  Well, that's like on ESPN when they do that, that Nutris system with those guys, all those guys like, hey, if I can do it, anybody can do it. 
[01:20:30]  By the time they edit the commercial and they get it on the air, the sports anchor's fat again.  Yeah.  Like that John Krupp guy.  He looks like a Rottweiler.  He's got one of those big St. Bernard.  He's got all the, yeah.  All the punches and they literally, they'll show it during the time when he's announcing sports.  Sure.  Whatever the hell it is they do.  You know what I found out that they were doing because it's illegal to have a before and after picture that are reversed.  You can't have somebody that lost weight and then gained a lot of weight on purpose and then put a before and after picture. 
[01:21:00]  They made that like illegal false advertising, whatever the hell they call it.  They were doing that?  Yes, years ago.  But they found a way to get around that.  The De Niro's of weight loss?  Yeah, yeah.  Putting on that raging bull weight.  Put on the weight.  For some reason they could take it off.  But they find athletes, they take out ads where they look for athletes that have had injuries and weren't able to work out and that gained weight. 
[01:21:30]  And they take pictures of them for the before picture knowing that once their injury is taken care of, they're going to get back in the gym and get back into shape.  Oh, wow.  And then they lose all the weight.  They're back buff again.  And it looks like they used this product to get into shape.  But what they really did was just get back into the shape they were in before they had this injury.  So it's just more, you know, more crap they're throwing at people.  Well, I noticed that on The Biggest Loser.  Like the first week, they just completely humiliate them.  And they put them up on that scale and make them take their shirt off and stand there in all their awfulness. 
[01:22:00]  Let America see your fat.  It's a bra that weighs 280 pounds.  It's not bad enough.  They get them down to the least amount of clothes possible.  Oh, literally like a six-foot creep.  That's for our pleasure.  On the side of their body.  That's for our pleasure as we watch at home.  But the second they start losing weight and all that, for the rest of the time, they have like a shirt on.  They never show the loose skin horror that they tuck into their sweatpants.  I'm really being mean right now.  Why not?  Well, most people are out of shape, and I'm trying to sell tickets. 
[01:22:30]  So I'm offending most of the audience.  It's the holidays.  It's fine.  Eat up.  Come on, comics.  Have a mindset.  I like that.  Well, like Kenny says, we want to shut you up because I eat bad on the road sometimes.  Like, Kenny, I want cookies.  Oh, treat yourself.  He's always saying that.  Just treat yourself.  You're worth it.  Yeah, it's okay.  You work hard.  He's such an enabler.  Kenny is the little voice in your head, which you don't want to do something, but you know you're going to, that justifies it.  Kenny's okay with that.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Treat yourself.  Do an extra push-up.  He'll go to the gym tomorrow. 
[01:23:00]  Thanks, Kenny.  You work hard all week.  Yeah.  All right.  Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's here in New York City.  212-757-4100.  I know that number by heart.  Oh, yeah.  Tonight through Sunday.  That's a good place.  I would try to remember Vinny's number if it didn't have ha-ha in it.  Yeah, Vinny's number is repulsive.  It's ridiculous.  And we're not even going to tell you what his club is called because he didn't buy advertising this week.  So F you, Vinny.  Go F yourself.  Yeah.  It's all about Bill Burr, Caroline, so we'll continue with Bill next. 
[01:23:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We get very excited when Bill Burr stops by.  We miss him.  Why'd you have to go to L.A., man?  Opie and Anthony.  Because my life was too comfortable.  I know.  You had to mess it up.  Yeah.  Some stress.  Everything was great, and I was like, you know, yeah, I need to...  Burr's going to be at Caroline's here in New York City starting tomorrow?  Tonight.  Yeah, tonight.  We're already at Thursday.  Oh, a short week for us.  That's why.  Okay.  It's like a Tuesday for me.  Thursday through Sunday night.  There you go.  Hey, we were talking about celebrity rehab just before we went back on the air. 
[01:24:00]  Another great show that we should be talking about on this show.  Stephen Adler.  I had no idea that he was that much of a mess.  I mean, I've read the stories like everyone else, but to see him...  Ah, he's like my favorite drummer, too, from all those...  I wouldn't really call them a metal band, but just from that period.  Yeah, sure.  He's like everybody had those huge drum kits.  He came out, he just had a little four-piece kit.  But yeah, he had like a cocaine-induced stroke.  So now we have to do that.  By doing a lot of coke, I guess. 
[01:24:30]  Well, I guess he tried to...  Yeah, he tried...  After he got kicked out of Guns N' Roses, he tried to kill himself, which I think totally  makes sense.  Yeah, you know, you're the drummer.  How do you go from playing giant stadiums sold out to trying to put...  Road Crew was the band he tried to put back together.  Ah, and you got to start over again in like the dives in L.A.  But didn't he get kicked out because of the drugs?  Yeah.  Moving your own equipment.  Imagine like you had a team of roadies.  You could just play and then leave.  Go to the hotel and just bang broads. 
[01:25:00]  Best looking skanks from the 80s.  That's it.  All the chicks that wanted backstage that would just kill for backstage.  You just pick them, get on the bus or limo, back to the hotel.  And there you are, a few years later, packing your own equipment from some dump bar in L.A.  Oh, yeah.  Into your car.  Yeah.  Just going, what...  What happened?  What happened?  Just trying to...  You knock over your cymbal stand.  You break a cymbal.  You don't have a cymbal deal anymore.  No, no.  Now you play with crack cymbals.  You're there at Sam Ash. 
[01:25:30]  Can I get a cymbal?  Well, let's...  Cash out of your pocket.  On Celebrity Rehab, they're saying that he's doing very well with the treatment.  Good.  And now he's saying, ah, I'm going to go back on the road.  And Dr. Drew is basically saying if he goes back on the road, he'll be dead.  He'll be dead.  Another show where they use the people.  I want to hear him play because he's got that speech impediment.  He just sits there like, can he still coordinate?  Yeah, for the play.  Yeah.  It looks like it, how he moves.  He's constantly moving like he's drumming.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Did you see the one when his mother came on?  Oh.  Oh, that was great.  Like they're sitting there and like they're saying, until you get over your anger with  your mom, you're never going to get past this.  Oh, he had a mother issue?  Yeah.  She kicked him out when he was 11.  Yeah.  11?  Okay, that's a little early.  She married some other dude, his stepdad, and he came home from school and his stuff  was out on the street because the stepdad was like the classic after school special  stepdad where he's just like, it's either him or me.  Don't leave me.  Yeah.  I'll get rid of the kid.  She put his crayons and stuff on the sidewalk. 
[01:26:30]  So whatever.  So she comes into the rehab, at least that's his version of it, right?  So she comes to rehab and immediately she's crying and he just goes, ah, the fake tears  again.  Oh, okay.  So he's not over it?  No.  Yeah, he was actually killing in a really sad way.  She goes, oh, Steven, you look great.  He goes, you said that when I was on drugs.  He had like a one-liner for everything that she had.  I'm like, this guy's hilarious.  He just wasn't buying anything that she was saying. 
[01:27:00]  Then it ends with him flipping over the couch, the classic.  I'm out.  Yeah.  And I'm out of here.  They didn't make up?  I don't know.  I don't know where they're at because they keep playing the same damn episode over and  over again.  I never know when the new ones are on, but.  What was she doing?  Was she trying to justify the crap and he wasn't hearing it?  Well, part of the treatment is to bring in the family members and get them to work out  some of their issues.  And she took control of his money and everything when he was like completely out of it.  Yeah.  And now, yeah, so now it's like she's trying to get the money back.  He's like, she's got millions from me. 
[01:27:30]  You're doing that stuff.  Oh, it's brutal.  She seems like one of those mothers that like nothing is good enough.  Like he was in Guns N' Roses and I bet she could give a crap.  Oh, that was another great one-liner.  He goes, yeah, that's when she started coming around to the gigs.  Oh, really?  It was awesome.  He was like nothing impressed this woman, it looks like.  Well, she didn't seem to also be able to admit any sort of wrongdoing.  She said, basically, she's like, you kicked yourself out with your behavior.  It's like, lady.  Dr. Drew, what was I supposed to do? 
[01:28:00]  He was disrupting the whole family.  Yeah.  He was 11.  He was 11.  Send him to his room.  That's not true, Dr. Drew.  Yeah, she was awful.  I pretty much have the voice down.  It goes right through you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was.  She's one of those people who gets lost in a relationship, had no job, and this guy  was making money selling his fish tackle or whatever awful business, whatever loser she  married.  It's a great show, and they're all disasters, and none of them will do well in the real world. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe one.  Did you watch in the beginning when Gary Busey was doing, like, he acted like he was there  to help people?  I'm so sick of Gary Busey.  I am sick.  You know what six stands for?  But Gary Busey really thought he was in this to help everybody else out, but he was in  because he has a problem, too.  No, but you end up feeling bad for him, like, because they're saying because he's not wearing  a helmet.  It was that motorcycle accident.  Yeah, he really did some sort of brain damage.  Of course he did.  He's a nut. 
[01:29:00]  So you can't, like, you can't hate the guy.  I'm just saying, I don't hate him.  I'm just so sick of him showing up on these reality shows.  But I really am done with reality shows.  That's why it's a, you know, I really don't watch a lot of them.  When they come up, I know a lot of people watch them and stuff, but I'm so sick of it.  A reality show, if it was real and reality, just let the camera roll.  But like you said, they put the music in.  They try to tug on your heartstrings.  It's not reality.  They direct these things.  They write them. 
[01:29:30]  There's a writer.  Look at the frigging credits at the end.  There's a writer's credit on a reality show.  So let the camera roll.  No, because if you do it that way, then you literally, to get five minutes of TV, you've  got to go through like 600 hours of footage.  Oh, well.  Which made the real world great, because it was real stuff going on.  And it went on for months.  They had to sit around.  Now I hear the real world house is like barely a month.  It's like two months.  It used to be six months.  Yeah, six months.  Easy.  And they would just camp out in the basement waiting for those special moments.  And they were regular, like, people at the beginning. 
[01:30:00]  And now it's a cast, like that Laguna Beach show or one of those.  Yeah, yeah.  The hills.  The guy.  They're in the hot tub.  Well, I think they're out of ideas at this point.  I saw one last night as I was falling asleep.  It was called Secret Millionaire.  A fox.  Yeah.  Basically, the gist is people who are millionaires hang out with poor people.  And I tried to shut it up the second one of the rich people was just like, I had no  idea people live like this.  Oh, no.  It was like trading places.  Oh, it's the worst PR ever for white people. 
[01:30:30]  Like, they were all that out of touch.  Like, I had no idea.  And I just, you know.  And then the whole stereotype, too, that rich people have no problems.  Oh, Mortimer.  Like, nobody's getting molested in a mansion.  Yeah.  Like, that only happens in, like, a crack house.  Of course.  It's like, come on.  It's, by the way, the reality, they call it assisted reality.  Yeah, they call it assisted reality.  Assisted reality.  I can't deal with it.  It's the same show.  Every show is the same show.  I blame.  There's different ideas, but. 
[01:31:00]  I blame the Osbournes, actually.  The Osbournes was such a great show.  And then they didn't want to do it anymore.  And everyone's like, well, we got to find the new Osbournes.  And they tried it with the Hogan family and others.  And it's like, well, obviously, we got to write material because they're not as interesting  as the Osbournes.  I think Sharon said there was never a take two.  That was what they shot.  That was what it was.  The worst on these reality shows is when something happens, they put on this ominous music and  show, like, someone turning their head and looking at the camera.  And they're like, they're all scared. 
[01:31:30]  And you know that turn of the head was just like, oh, I got to go shopping later.  Like, it wasn't.  It had nothing to do with that moment.  There's these dramatic pauses that you know never happened.  It's like, well, then why did you do it?  And then the person's staring at them, just looking.  And you know that in reality it was like, why did you do it?  Because I felt like it.  I felt like it.  Oh, okay.  I'll see you later.  Yeah.  But they make it into this big thing.  It's all phony.  I can't deal with it. 
[01:32:00]  What about when they have, I like when they clearly only have 12 hours of footage, but  they stretch it out over an hour.  So that literally, as you're going into commercial, it's like, well, then I don't want to live  here anymore.  And then when they come back from commercial, they start the whole fight over again.  You got to sit there for another three minutes, just get to the power.  Well, I don't want to live here anymore.  It's like, dude, you just showed this.  That's a new thing.  This is a half hour show and you're making it an hour.  And you got to recap after a commercial.  Yeah.  That's like the stand up.  Huh?  He knows what I'm talking about.  Come on.  Back me up. 
[01:32:30]  Round of applause.  If you ever ate an apple.  Hey, right, ladies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before we move on from Celebrity Rehab, that model, is that a hot story?  She is the best looking junkie I've ever seen.  She was a super model.  She was on the French cover of Cosmo.  I guess that's really important in the business.  And she's very famous.  You would recognize her pictures from years ago.  Dude, she was so down on her luck and so addicted. 
[01:33:00]  She was hooking.  She was hooking.  Wow.  They got to that point?  Yes.  She was an escort.  That turns me on.  Rock.  And now she's trying to get her life together on this Celebrity Rehab.  Keep fighting.  But she lost it all.  She didn't shoot that up?  I didn't see that.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  Get a picture of her.  Jimmy, can you imagine that?  You know, you're always praying and it looks like the picture.  And she actually shows up.  It's actually her.  I always pray and she looks like the picture.  What kind of messes are showing up? 
[01:33:30]  Do they look like the picture?  I've never hired an escort.  I always did eye to eye on the street.  Jimmy, do they look like the picture?  Here's what happened, right?  Ant knew that Bill's a decent guy, but he didn't want to make it look like I'm just such a pig.  So he had to be diplomatic.  And he goes, well, Bill, what do you think?  Instead of going...  Like the picture?  I don't do it.  Instead of going right to the source.  Let me look around the room.  Just random Jimmy.  I mean...  Yeah.  This is how they should have went, hey, scumbag, when they show up, sometimes they do, a lot  of times they don't.  A lot of times they don't? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Some of the ads, they'll Photoshop a head in.  It's so obviously not them because the lighting is different.  Here's the girl.  You know what you should do, Jim?  You should actually, like, make a copy of the picture with your printer, and then they  show up, just hold it up to their face, and they're just shaking it.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Beat it.  Look at this girl.  She was so down on her luck.  She started escorting her.  She's on celebrity rehab.  Find a hot photo.  They're all hot.  What's her name?  Amber Smith.  Amber Smith.  Amber Smith, yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Let's see.  All right.  No, that's not bad.  That's not bad, though.  There's way better pictures than that.  Yeah, no, she's, like, naturally gorgeous.  But, like, gorgeous.  Just go with the face right here to start.  And she had to, uh...  Look at this face, and the body matches.  This is showing up to your Super 8 at 4 in the morning.  Look at the face.  Look at this.  She's a Super 8.  All right, look at this.  She started...  And she, uh...  The drugs got her to the point she was escorting.  She's actually better looking than that.  Yeah.  Why'd she start doing drugs?  I don't even know.  I think she was doing it the whole time, like a lot of these models. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, with her mom.  Her mom kind of got her into it.  Her mom?  I didn't hear that part.  Oh, yeah.  No, I'll tell you what's brutal, though.  If you see what her mom looks like, she looks like Large Marge, and you're like, wow.  Large Marge.  That's what she's going to look like.  In the future.  Yeah, the mom is horrific looking.  In the future.  Well, if she keeps doing the drugs, she will keep the weight off.  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes it's bad when the girls stop doing coke and gain a lot of weight.  Happened in the 80s to that girl that was...  What was she on? 
[01:35:30]  That...  Not TJ Hooker, because that was...  What's her name?  The other blonde.  The other Heather.  Heather Thomas.  Oh, yeah.  Was just a coke fiend.  And she...  You know, she was nice and skinny and everything.  And then she got all fat.  Stopped doing coke.  She got all fat.  Well, you know what's funny?  Like, junkies, like hardcore junkies, really are skinny for life.  Like Keith Richards.  Yeah, yeah.  All those rock stars.  It's like Iggy Pop.  The guy's shredded.  He's like 62. 
[01:36:00]  He still has abs.  Something about doing heroin.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, there she is.  Here's some picture members.  But she might have been escorting.  A lot of them escort.  Like, porn stars escort.  They call it doing privates.  But a lot of them make $2,500 an hour.  You got a corporate gig.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Just tagging some guy from Exxon.  Yes.  They get a lot of money.  So she wasn't escorting, like, Craigslist escorting probably.  I'm guessing.  Right.  She's probably, you know, she might have been getting $3,000 an hour. 
[01:36:30]  Like, Playboy Girls escort.  Oh, like a lot of cash, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like real money.  I'm sure she did.  You could basically rub one out from across the room.  She's standing.  Act like you're on the runway.  Yeah.  Do that little turn.  Wow.  All right.  Maybe no more naked pictures because it completely just stopped the show.  Well, it distracts us a little bit.  I understand.  Google Amber Smith for some awesome pictures.  But what you do, though, when an escort shows up who's not the picture.  I've only sent one escort away. 
[01:37:00]  And she was, I wanted this blonde girl.  And this brunette, kind of heavy, showed up.  And she was nice.  Did the penis bother you?  No, no, no.  She actually didn't have one, which bothered me.  I'm like, look, this said blonde, passable, and fully functional.  Explanation?  False advertising.  It was a really skinny blonde girl.  And I said to the girl on the phone, if the girl in this picture doesn't show up,  I'm going to send her back.  And she goes, no, no, no, it's her.  Totally different girl.  And the girl showed up, and she was nice. 
[01:37:30]  And I go, look, you're not the girl I asked for.  You're very pretty.  But I had it, and I showed her on the computer.  This is the girl they told me was coming.  And she was, yeah, they do that sometimes.  And I called the lady.  I'm like, this is the girl you told me.  Why did you send somebody else?  You just lied to me.  And she was, well, put her on the phone.  And the girl was like, okay.  And she was going to leave.  I just gave her 50 bucks for coming, because I felt bad for her.  Oh, you were nice about it.  It wasn't the escort's fault.  She was a scumbag agency.  I asked for a skinny blonde.  You are a fat brunette.  No, I even said she's very pretty, but, you know, I'm like, I had a particular thing 
[01:38:00]  for this one girl, and that's what you told me.  And, you know, I wasn't a dick about it.  Bastards.  Yeah.  I was going to call the police, but I figured.  Yeah, probably not a good idea.  Yeah.  I like how you called up an escort service.  You're like, why did you lie to me?  Yeah, most of you would just be like.  The entire meeting is a lie.  This girl really doesn't like you.  Go in, throw her a bang in, give her money, and then have her leave while you're all disappointed  and mad that you gave her money.  And then, who calls?  I just didn't feel like there was enough honesty. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Who calls?  Jimmy wants scruples.  I do.  Yeah, we need some, you know.  We want this to be on the up and up.  We want some honesty in this business.  I'm bringing honesty back to prostitution.  What kind of whorehouse are you running?  It's called the Bait and Switch.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It's called the Better Business Bureau.  I did.  I filed a complaint.  I wanted to dehumanize this one girl, and they sent another girl for me to dehumanize.  You're a jerk.  No, but I was very nice. 
[01:39:00]  I've actually taken a few that I didn't want.  Speaking of which, here's something.  You know, I actually, late at night, I actually ordered something against every principle.  What are you doing?  I ordered the Sham Wow.  What's the show?  I swear to God.  This is the biggest.  I don't know what that is.  You know what?  Dude, but he took this, he takes this face cloth, he sticks it in an aquarium, and all  the water goes away, and then he wrings it out of the sink, and the fish are coming  out.  It was incredible.  Dude, it's...  I'm like, and he's like, you know what he got me?  He goes, you'll never have to buy paper towels again, and I'm like, that's good for 
[01:39:30]  the environment.  I'm getting one of these, right?  First of all, I was on the phone for like three hours.  Yeah, what did you also sign up for CDs and...  I couldn't get out.  I finally had to hang up, and dude, I came in, dude, they're possibly worse than paper  towels.  Dude, it's called a Sham Wow.  What did you...  No, I don't...  What a Sham.  Wow.  This guy...  And wow is for...  Wow, someone bought this.  I've watched this infomercial.  My favorite part is like, you know, and the Germans make it. 
[01:40:00]  You know, Germans always make good stuff.  Do they?  Yeah.  Cars, rockets.  I watched this infomercial.  Look, he pours soda on this piece of carpet.  A lot of it.  Watch for the edit.  Then look, yeah, watch the edit.  Look, it's dripping through this carpet.  Then he takes the Sham Wow, and he placed it on top.  Now look, there's no soda coming out of the bottom anymore, by the way.  He rolls it up.  Look how much just came out, because it was already full of soda.  I fell for this hook, line, and sinker.  Now look, he pats it really hard, lifts up the carpet. 
[01:40:30]  Look, it's dry.  How did they not catch that?  It's a horrible edit.  It's a horrid edit.  And how come the table's not wet anymore?  Nothing.  It soaks it up like crazy.  Because it's the Sham Wow.  Look at all these white trash losers, and I actually bought this.  They went to like a county fair where the Sham Wow stand was set up and interviewed  these fat, white, trash idiots who are these rubes, if you will.  What's wrong with you, Bill?  Are you lonely out there, Bill?  Bill's a rube.  I don't know what happened.  Give me your number. 
[01:41:00]  I'll call you.  But I continue to use it, and every time I use it, I'm cursing my brains out.  Sir, sir, why don't you come up here?  I have this fine elixir for you, right off the wagon.  Your ancestors were in front of the snake oil salesman buying this elixir.  Who's that guy from Green Acres?  Mr. Haney.  Hey, well, let me tell you, I got the Sham Wow.  Oh, Mr. Haney.  Mr. Douglas, it'll clean up anything.  The Sham Wow. 
[01:41:30]  I bought that, what did I buy?  I bought that set it and forget it thing, which was great.  Everything is set it and forget it.  Showtime Grill.  Showtime Grill was great.  Oh, is that the one where he goes, set it, and the audience goes, and forget it.  Oh, you bought that?  Turn on an oven and just walk away.  Yeah, forget about it.  Just forget it.  Just forget about it, yeah.  Next thing is the firemen at your house hosing it down.  You're not supposed to forget it totally.  Yeah, but there's a thing.  That thing was great. 
[01:42:00]  Really?  It worked?  It was great, yeah.  That thing totally worked.  But the Sham Wow.  What happened with the Sham Wow?  I might as well be wiping up water with this plastic bag.  That's about how good it is.  You just move it around.  Dude, I'm on a hardwood floor, and I can't get it all up.  When did it sink in that, oh my God, I was ripped off?  The second I got in, it smells bad.  The whole thing, but I continue to use it.  Were you so excited when the package came in the mail, like, oh, my Sham Wow is here? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I was literally expecting it.  I was going to go stick it in the toilet to do a demonstration.  I didn't see how much it absorbed.  Yeah, check this out.  I just wring it out to the top of the toilet.  And you did this to conserve, to not waste paper towels.  Yeah, and what I did was actually, you know, those things are probably not even biodegradable.  Oh, sure.  You know, and this is a great scam, too, because I guess you can return it a month in if you  don't like it.  Use it, yeah.  But the genius is, is that 1995, am I really going to go through the problems of repackaging  this and sending it back to Germany? 
[01:43:00]  That's what they're banking on, that you're never going to return something that's so cheap  you're just going to take my head.  I might as well use notebook paper.  It's that bad.  It's horrible.  The wow sham.  If you want to save paper towels, just be neater.  Bill, what's wrong with you?  Just don't be such a messy guy.  Let me tell you.  I have a really bad habit of setting glasses of water down on the floor, and it can literally  be 90 feet away from me, and somehow I will forget, and I will, I just kick it across  the room.  The other day, here's how eco-friendly I am. 
[01:43:30]  The other day, I'm reaching into the fridge for a beer, of course, and it falls out of the  fridge and smashes on the floor in front of the refrigerator.  Uh-huh.  I calmly grabbed a full roll of paper towels, and by the end, I had a cardboard tube and  a giant pile of beer-soaked and glass-embedded paper towels that I just picked up and threw  in the garbage, and everything was fine. 
[01:44:00]  It was an entire roll, brand new, from the plastic to the cardboard tube, because I don't  care.  I know.  That's the worst.  I'm not getting a sham wow.  I don't mind you.  At least you're conscious of the fact.  I'm not getting one.  You're wearing one on your head.  My sham wow on my head.  Oh, that's good.  I should get one.  I'm keeping soaked in water, water my follicles. 
[01:44:30]  Well, we're not going to do better than that, so let's take a break.  Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline starting tonight.  Through Sunday, Bill, they gave you the Sunday, too?  That's crazy.  So how many?  Two, four, seven?  Six shows.  Wow.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday is six right there.  Two Friday, two Saturday, right?  I don't know what Saturday.  It's either two or three Saturday.  So you've got Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday to see Bill Burr at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  Opie and Anthony, starring Jim Norton.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial. 
[01:45:00]  Hang with Jim Norton.  He's going to D.C. today, I do believe.  Right, Jimmy?  Yes.  I'm in D.C.  At the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia.  Ticketmaster.  I don't know if there's tickets left.  There might be.  Friday night, I've got two shows.  It's my only D.C. appearance.  First one since Monster Race.  D.C. area.  And Bill Burr in studio playing Caroline's here in New York City for people that are staying local.  Yeah.  As far as New York goes.  And I've got to say congrats on your Bruins.  Having a good year there.  Well, it's early.  That's not so good. 
[01:45:30]  They're doing great, though, for the situation they're in.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  Yeah.  It's a successful season.  Plus, you know.  I have to admit, I didn't believe in Brett Favre.  And Jets are right in it.  What, are they 8-4?  8-4.  Jets aren't going to win anything.  Won five out of their last six.  And I'm sitting there.  When they made that move, everyone else is running and getting the jerseys.  I'm like, ugh.  This is a horrible move.  I'm actually, you know what?  I mean, I hate the Jets.  I don't even hate the Jets.  I just hate that Mangini guy. 
[01:46:00]  You don't like Eric Mangini?  The rat.  That guy built his whole career filming people.  And he rats out Bill Belichick.  Eh, good point.  And that really isn't.  I never met the man.  And I have no idea what went on behind the scenes.  No, but I think the point you're making.  I just made that up.  And you know what, the point should be mentioned that all these guys did what Belichick did.  So that's what was good for, you know, actually if there's any sort of good thing about Brady  going down, it just kind of made all that stupid crap go away.  Although I was pissed at the Titans when they're going 11-0 and people are barely even talking 
[01:46:30]  about it.  It's like we were under a microscope the entire year.  Well, the Jets took care of that.  What's that?  The Titans.  Oh, and they took care of the Titans, yeah.  They took care of that little problem.  I'm actually happy.  I didn't want to see Brett Favre have an ugly season, though, so that's cool.  Yeah.  Can I ask a question that's off the subject?  What happened with John and Kate?  Plus eight!  Are you obsessed with this now?  No, but I realized we didn't talk about that.  And Sammykins went and did an interview.  We're waiting for you guys to take a little peek.  I know it's going to be painful, but you've got to take a little peek at this John and Kate 
[01:47:00]  plus eight.  It's on all the effing time.  I absolutely will.  Well, I go on YouTube and watch the real clips of her being a total bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, is she the worst?  Well, bring Sam in here.  Do you know the show, Bill?  No, but I heard the whole thing.  I can't imagine if I was expecting a child.  You know, like they always hear guys in the delivery room, and when the baby comes out,  they panic because they feel nothing.  But then when the second they hold their kid, then all of a sudden-  Like you're brainwashed. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, the love comes out.  But if she just kept pumping them out, I would feel nothing for all six of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Other than an unbelievable amount of stress.  Yes.  I would just be looking at their mouths like, ah!  You've got to feed all those and clothe them.  I was watching some clip on YouTube.  Put them all in one crib, hope a couple get smothered.  That's brutal, sorry.  That was a tax deferment.  I was saying yesterday that they would film different episodes.  Was it you, Jimmy?  Just to get rid of some of these kids? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah, where you film the episode of them, you know, like playing with a running car in  the garage.  Like, hey, we're going to have them just play with the car in a closed garage.  Basically, this guy John is in hell, so he comes up with other ideas for future shows.  Skydiving children.  You know, just put them in a situation when something might happen.  How can you carry them?  What size are they when six come out?  You put photos of cake over all the outlets.  Two-pronged forks for them to eat it with. 
[01:48:30]  She had eight kids with two pregnancies.  Twins and then six.  Wow.  And not only that, she's a bitch.  And she's got, like, OCD stuff.  Like, she's a need freak.  She's got off as this entitled, like, so entitled just because she was able to drop so many kids  out of that distorted mess that used to be your womanhood.  Yeah.  Does she, is it, is it, is she really just seems like she's a bitch or is it because, 
[01:49:00]  oh my God, I have eight kids and I haven't adjusted to it yet?  They have footage of them when they were, like, just a happy couple.  And, man, he should have got a clue way back then.  That poor bastard.  No, he deserves it.  Why?  Because if someone's just treating you like crap, man or woman, you don't leave them.  It's on you at some point.  With eight kids, though, now, it's at the point where he's stuck.  If she was being the big C-note before he even married her, then.  No, she was kind of being cool, I think, right?  No, really.  She was like, before they had kids, didn't they have kind of a loving relationship? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, the signs were there.  Were they?  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  Sam loves this show.  Tell us all about it, Sam.  I don't love this show.  No, you do.  You secretly do.  My girlfriend loves this show and we share a one bedroom, so it's on all the time.  You live in Sin?  Well, it's not Sin.  It's Sin.  It's Sin.  It's Sin.  It's like Artist Gilmore.  It's ABA Afro.  Sam in his ABA Afro.  You've got to get mutton chops with that, man.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, that'll look good.  And a headband.  He can't grow that. 
[01:50:00]  I might be.  I don't know.  He can't grow facial hair.  What's wrong with you?  I shave.  Facial hair thing that could happen.  Yeah.  Try for some sideburns.  Okay, I'll try.  Try for some mutton chop sideburns.  All right, we're doing sideburns.  All right.  But yeah, the show, I don't think she was ever pleasant.  The kids can't make you that much of a bitch.  She's that far gone.  There's no way she was ever a nice girl.  Yeah.  God, you have that many kids, though, and you're a guy, you have so much responsibility 
[01:50:30]  and work to do just to raise these kids.  And then you have this nag just pecking at you constantly, no matter what you're doing.  It's not like this guy is constantly effing off.  It seems to me like he's trying to run a household, support a family and stuff, and she is constantly  just pecking at him.  Nip, nip, nip.  What's the age difference between the twins and the sex tuplets? 
[01:51:00]  Well, Sam would know because he watches the show religiously.  Well, it's not religiously, but the sex tuplets are three, last I checked.  And so you say, I think, even though we know.  Yeah, I think.  I think the twins are seven, maybe.  Seven months.  No, seven years old.  Twins are seven years old.  Seven years old, okay.  Yeah.  Before your break?  Yeah.  Hey, Jay and Huntington, there's a John and Kate spinoff in the works.  Yes, John and Kate plus Yates. 
[01:51:30]  Did I guess today?  I don't know if we did.  No.  I said something about going to Houston.  I don't think I rhymed it.  I should have.  All right, we got some Kate audio here.  Yeah, I went through some of the shows and found some of the best examples of who she is  as a person.  Listen to this, Bill.  Great.  It's not bad enough that they have eight effing kids.  Fix her dress, John.  I got to put this back in the car.  Joel, get off my leg.  Honey, I got to go to the car. 
[01:52:00]  I said that.  Oh, what would it be?  John, turn around, Leah, and show Daddy your dress.  If he doesn't really care, I'll fix your dress.  I did say fix her dress four times.  Let's go this way.  He didn't even hear me still.  All right, fix her dress.  I said fix her dress.  Fix her dress.  I think what we're going to do is...  Oh, my God.  I started shaking.  She had already fixed the dress, and she was just driving home the point that she told  him to, and he didn't do it.  He didn't.  And then she pawns it off on the kid. 
[01:52:30]  Look, look.  Yeah.  Look, look.  He didn't want to look at your dress.  Yeah.  Yeah, but as a mother, though, how many times can she...  It's like if she's got to fix the dress one time, if she says, can you fix the dress,  why isn't he helping her out?  Because he's probably doing 20 other goddamn things.  Am I right?  This dummy.  Yeah.  It's probably...  Trying to keep her happy.  He just changed his 50th diaper of the day.  Oh, there was a clip I was watching yesterday, just little bow-legged kids in diapers running  around.  Ugh.  Dude, you would literally...  I get like a panic attack when I'm listening to that, because I can actually... 
[01:53:00]  I almost put myself in that position and what it would feel like.  It's such an alien way of life to me.  It would be like doing anything that's completely different, like moving to friggin' India for  me and looking around.  If I owned a farm, it's the only way you can have eight kids if you're like the Waltons.  Yeah, and you don't care if you lose one or two to like a well.  Yeah, yeah.  You have your own well water.  Exactly.  You can go deer hunting.  And then you get a one falls in the well.  You just, oh, well, we got eight more. 
[01:53:30]  Or if they get loud, you put grandpa up on the top floor with a cigarette.  Remember the Waltons?  House burned?  Yeah, well...  Oh, of course.  Yes.  I was trying to picture some sort of torture there.  Did he drop the ashes down through a hole?  No, he just burned the house down the doddering old fella.  Hey, the next one, well, what, they're going to go on a romantic date?  Oh, yeah, well...  They find time to be romantic, Bill.  Yeah, sometimes, like...  Sure they do.  Yeah.  Maybe on an anniversary or for Valentine's Day, John and Kate decide to get romantic and  have somebody come in and take care of their thousand kids. 
[01:54:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Louise Woodward.  So we can leave early and go to our luxurious dinner date.  Lovely.  John, are you going to be ready someday?  He takes longer to get ready than I do.  Who cares?  John, please help me instead of playing with toys.  By the way, when she says playing with toys, she means going and picking up the kids' toys  that are on the floor.  Right.  Oh, yeah, he was playing with them.  I would have kicked one right into her face. 
[01:54:30]  I would have lobbed a Tonka truck right into her face.  He's doing chores, but since they're not this specific chore that she asked for at that  moment, he's bad.  Well, it almost sounds like he's doing chores to avoid going out there, though.  It's like, she's got a romantic night planned, and he's like, he is kind of like just taking  his time.  So what, it takes him longer than her.  Who cares?  Why would you have a romantic night with a woman who's squirted out eight kids and two  pregnancies?  Oh, really?  What is that?  Going to be a treat when you get home and get to the fun part?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Takes time to tie the board to your ass. 
[01:55:00]  And finally, just one more for today.  What do we got, Sam?  Well, which one is it?  Is it the last one?  Yeah, yeah.  I think this is the one Mike actually found it on YouTube.  What is she?  They're getting ready, I think.  They're always getting ready.  He treats John like a retard?  Yeah.  That's what it says here?  Yeah.  That's what it is.  She's treating him like he's retarded.  Like, she needs to walk him through everything.  And I have recently, um, we've collectively decided that I need to be home. 
[01:55:30]  Is there wearing their nice shoes?  What did I tell you the other day?  When we go away, they wear their...  Nice shoes.  I don't understand why you ask me.  Who cares?  I do.  Hey, why don't you ask every time they go away, which shoes are they wearing?  Um, T.  La La.  Oh, this is a wonderful day.  Maybe I'll be back to the paper number.  Hey, Kate, when are you going to pull the stick out?  Because it's getting really annoying.  I didn't hold my tongue. 
[01:56:00]  I just said what was on my mind.  I thought you...  Oh, what a brave guy.  Finally.  You're going to pull the stick out.  Why don't you pull the stick out?  Like she's got a stick up there, you know?  While she's trying to get the kids ready, all of a sudden he's accusing her of being stiff.  Well, apparently there was a problem with the shoes.  Exactly.  What was the problem with the shoes?  He's asking the same dumb questions every time she's already answered.  He said...  He does sound a little idiot.  He sounds like a moron.  He said, dope.  He said, are they going to...  Of course he's stupid.  He hooked up with her.  Are they going to wear the nice shoes?  And she goes, well, what did I say? 
[01:56:30]  I said, every time we go out, they wear the...  And he went, nice shoes.  Why does she have to quiz?  You know something, you bitches?  Why do you got to quiz?  It's like, what shoes are they putting on?  Well, didn't I tell you...  Just say it!  Right, I obviously don't know.  Say what shoes!  Don't give me a quiz as to why I should remember what you said.  Well, when they go out and it's to a nice event, what did I say? 
[01:57:00]  All right, I'm an idiot.  No, honey, I'm sorry.  You're not compelling.  Yeah.  I forget everything you say right after you're done saying it.  Exactly.  Just say it.  What shoes do they wear?  Oh, the good shoes.  Thank you.  No argument.  No problem.  But it's got to be, oh, now, I told you this a while ago.  Now, here comes the quiz.  Here comes the quiz.  Well, you get tired of answering the same questions.  Oh, you're a bitch, too.  No, Kate has said this to him, and he's not...  What's he doing?  Get the nice shoes. 
[01:57:30]  I've got to go with Jim here.  The guy does sound like I would be yelling at him after about five minutes.  How would you remember anything with eight monsters running around?  This guy, he's not just sitting down for a second.  You know what?  He has retard sperm.  It's a little extra strong.  That's why they had eight kids.  No, they were on fertility drugs.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what it was?  Which is brilliant, great, science, there's science for you.  Yeah, there's a reason you're not supposed to have children.  Yeah.  If you're not having kids, you go to the doctor to have a bunch of kids. 
[01:58:00]  Now you have more kids than God wanted you to have.  God wanted zero.  You now have eight because of modern science.  They created their own traffic jam.  Yeah.  In 20 years, when they all get cars.  You're not supposed to eat every grape, either.  You should pick and choose which ones you're going to keep in there.  Right.  There are some rotten ones.  Right.  You leave them in the bowl and throw them away.  That's right.  You don't eat every cherry.  Jimmy, you just scarred a few.  You know what I'm saying there?  Kate.  Jesus.  Yes, Jimmy.  This is more than a fertility drug.  You would actually strip her clothes off and then drag her by the ankles through manure. 
[01:58:30]  Here's the rest of the retard quote.  Really annoying.  I didn't hold my tongue.  I just said what was on my mind.  I thought she had a bug up somewhere.  A bug?  No, sorry, a stick somewhere.  And I just said it.  He's not going to say it again.  I regret it saying now because I...  He does not talk that way to me.  Oh, god damn.  Oh, she doesn't understand anything.  She doesn't understand what real men are like then. 
[01:59:00]  What real honest men are like.  You're a bitch.  He told you you're being a bitch and he's not to talk to you like that?  Who are you?  You're a god damn water slide.  You disgusting mess.  This is our latest obsession.  How do you feel about it, Anthony?  Oh, I hate this woman.  This is why I love playing it.  Well, Sam got to talk to Kate from John and Kate Plus 8 yesterday.  Wow.  Yep.  I went down and got the exclusive interview with her.  She was in town literally a half a block from here and Sam went and surprised they didn't  adopt him. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  He looked so adoptable.  How was your time with Kate from John and Kate Plus 8?  Oh, it was great.  Really, you could tell the warmth in her heart with the first clip because I asked her,  like, what do you think has made this obsession take off?  Like, the way people are just getting obsessed with it.  Fair enough question.  And I mean, the warmth in her heart for all the fans and going into detail and stuff is  outstanding.  All righty.  We got to take a break, though.  We have a quick break we got to take, right?  You want to do it that way?  Yeah.  We have to.  I think it's just...  All right.  And the phones are lit, so... 
[02:00:00]  We'll be hanging here.  All right.  It's like a big teaser.  It's like a reality show.  Well, we got...  Well, we got to go to the phones, too, because Ant still want to have sex without condoms.  I hate this lady's coming in.  Get this lady some Christmas shoes.  Clean that out like a clogged bathtub drain.  Kate is exactly...  Pull out all that hair.  My ex.  Imagine how she is off camera.  Said you're not on BCN.  Well, we'll get to that one.  John needs to be introduced to someone, someone whatever, and John and Kate is my future. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, good.  Is someone getting multiple births for Christmas?  Lucky you.  So we'll have Sam's exclusive interview with Kate after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Bill Burr, Caroline's, all weekend long.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to get out of here and go to the other place in a few minutes.  Bill Burr at Caroline's, all weekend long.  Sam did what's the haps with Kate from John and Kate Plus 8.  Yeah, I got her.  And before that, though, Wayne has been holding on.  I don't want to lose him.  Wayne, Franklin Square, he says that this is his future. 
[02:01:00]  Wayne, you're going to have multiple births?  Well, I'm Irish family.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  But I'm an Irish family.  I married my wife.  She's a great person.  She is an Irish woman, so she's kind of angry in general.  But she's the most beautiful person I know.  And I know Anthony's probably getting sick by me saying this.  And, um, it's just that I, I don't know, I'm so petrified and I'm scared because I know 
[02:01:30]  we want to have kids and I just, I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself one day because my  wife is going to just turn into a bitch.  And, but she's, I think she's not.  She'll probably, listen, then have to kill me when I get home, even though I don't actually.  So you're going to have a, you're going to have a kid.  You're not going to have eight.  Yeah.  There's a big difference.  What do you think is going to happen?  Just treat her with respect.  Now I just jerked John and asked her if she's got a stick somewhere.  Oh, I hate this woman.  Let's go to Beth in the Bronx.  Beth. 
[02:02:00]  She's laughing.  What's up, Beth?  You know, I just want to call you guys, um, um, Opie, congratulations on your wedding.  Oh, thank you.  And then Anthony, congratulations on your hair.  I just want to say, at least her husband tells her what needs to be told.  If my boyfriend didn't tell me when I was being a bee, I would hate him for it.  And when he's a pain, I tell him he is.  That's what a relationship is.  If you're not honest, you're going to hate the other person.  You have a constant, like, just demeaning each other is not, uh... 
[02:02:30]  No, no, no, definitely not.  Not demeaning.  But, I mean, you know, if you're a bee, you're a bee.  And, you know, say it like it is.  You can say bitch.  You just can't say, uh...  What, the double amputee?  Yeah, I didn't know what, you know, FCC gets a little upset about.  And I love you guys, so I don't want you off the air.  All right.  Thank you.  Take care, boys.  Bye.  Bye.  What, it's just the amputee?  No, no, no, no, no.  She had fallen.  I thought they were showing the falling cup.  Look at these.  All women sprinting with one real leg and one fake leg. 
[02:03:00]  One leg.  A couple of them aren't that bad.  See, this is what we were talking about earlier.  Look, it's...  If you have to lose a leg or an arm, you've got to go with the leg.  We were saying that.  They don't have the arm thing figured out.  We were saying that exact thing earlier.  But if you see these ladies running from the waist up, you couldn't tell that they had a fake leg.  They would kick your ass in a race.  Of course they would.  They'd kick your ass.  Not if I unhinged that thing, they don't.  Put an electromagnet in the track.  That's right. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Take care, kangaroo.  All right.  We've got to get back to Kate.  So, Sam did...  What's the hat with Kate from this Johnny Kate?  You didn't talk to her like that, did you?  What's the hats?  Well, yeah.  Just...  I mean, I wanted to relate to her a little bit.  I was just trying to be friendly.  There we go.  And she's in New York promoting...  Like, she's famous for...  Well, yeah, there are people lined up...  This is left-up country, man.  People lined up around the block to see this chick.  She's a mom.  She's a hero.  So, we're here with Kate from Johnny Kate Plus 8.  Kate, what's the haps? 
[02:04:00]  Who what?  What's the haps?  I don't know about this lingo, but I'm here actually with P&G, the Brand Saver Live pop-up store.  It's here until December 11th.  What do you think it is about Johnny Kate Plus 8 that's kind of created such a phenomenon?  To be honest, I have no clue.  I'm just doing my job.  I don't know.  Sam's really good at these interviews.  I know exactly.  You're setting her up nice.  Yeah.  Getting her comfortable.  Right. 
[02:04:30]  He's just throwing the jab out there.  Sure.  But she wasn't even, like, appreciative of, like, a hundred people who had showed up to this corner store.  I don't know this lingo.  I don't know.  I'm doing my job.  Yeah.  I'm just...  She wasn't smiling.  She wasn't friendly.  She was reminding me of...  Who was that figure skater when she was riding with Mickey Mouse going, oh, my God, this is so stupid.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they had audio of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that Kerrigan?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's riding with Mickey Mouse in some parade.  They had her mic'd, and she's just like, oh, this is so stupid.  This is stupid.  But it is stupid.  Yeah.  Right, with a big fake mouse, some struggling actor in there, lying to children. 
[02:05:00]  She was right.  Some pedo was in there.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  So, yeah, it's...  But I like the fact that she was honest.  What's the big phenomenon?  I don't know.  Well, Sam...  Kate tells her like it is.  Sam asks her about her treatment of John, right?  Well, yeah, and then I kind of started to talk about the reviews of the show and setting  her up that way.  All right, here we go.  What's it been like to go from a private to a public figure? 
[02:05:30]  I struggle with it.  I'm thrilled that people are thrilled to see us, but it does make everyday life a little  difficult.  How does it make you feel when people criticize you for being overbearing or emasculating  John or things like that?  I honestly do not pay attention.  I know in my heart I'm doing the best that I can.  And we're just parents raising our kids to be...  On television.  ...productive, loving, wonderful, hardworking individuals.  Oh, she sounds terrible. 
[02:06:00]  Wanting to raise her kids.  She loves it.  Everybody loves when they show up.  She's this lady.  She's terrific.  She's seething, though.  But yeah, and that's the problem.  As soon as that question was asked, that's when her people started rushing me out.  Her people?  That's when...  What, the eight children?  Because she shouldn't have people.  That's when I started getting, you know, all right, we got to go.  We got to do this thing.  She's got to go.  Exploitation, man.  Making a living off eight kids like this.  Is that all the kids?  Any more, Kate?  No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got one more.  Here we go.  And finally, was there a point once the kids came along that the relationship changed at 
[02:06:30]  all or has it always been steady?  Because there almost seemed to be a point that John almost got defeated.  Really?  Really?  Wow.  I've never heard one word to the point across so...  You're so pissed.  You have to use it as a sound clip.  Fantastic. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, that was a machine.  Really?  Really?  I got to hear that again.  Oh, Lord.  You know how many times a poor husband hears that really?  When he says something, she just...  Really?  You got to give it up.  She is...  She's not trying to hide any sort of pissed off or ugliness or anything.  She's not sugarcoating her real personality.  You're like John.  Yeah.  And she had no kids with her.  It was just her by herself alone.  But she wasn't relaxed.  She wasn't like...  It's not the kids.  It's her.  Did she look pretty, though?  She's a pretty lady.  She actually wasn't bad looking in person. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, she is.  Smart hairdo?  Yeah.  No, she had a very smart pantsuit on.  Pantsuit, of course.  And short, gelled, spiked hair.  Nothing like spiked, but...  I guarantee they're trying to have another kid just to keep this dumb show going.  I guarantee it.  No, because it won't rhyme.  Yeah.  Plus, you can't spell blessings with an I.  Another time, plus nine.  Does that rhyme?  Rhymes ain't funny.  Here we go.  It doesn't. 
[02:08:00]  I missed that.  That's hilarious.  Sam, were you a little nervous with the really?  That's on the show.  Yeah.  She stares right through you when she's got this cold, blue stare.  Wow.  She's very intimidating.  I wish she slapped your face.  I thought she was going to.  Oh, God.  She wants to raise her kids to be loving people, though.  What's wrong with this lady?  Of course.  You know, I love you, Sam, but, man, a nice slapper from Kate would have been beautiful  for our show. 
[02:08:30]  You should have commented on her lasagna belly.  I'm being all stretched out.  That's the thing.  I wasn't even, like, this question wasn't even as bad as I wanted to be, but I had, like,  one question left.  Here we go.  And finally, was there a point once the kids came along that the relationship changed  at all, or has it always been steady?  Because there almost seemed to be a point that John almost got defeated.  Really?  I think that what you're referring to is the fact that life with eight kids is difficult.  It was a surprise. 
[02:09:00]  It was not anything we ever had planned.  We had to adjust quickly.  And we're doing the best that we can.  Yeah, she sounds terrific.  Would he date her, Jimmy?  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, look, a lot of people are intimidated by a strong woman that doesn't take any gunk  or bunk.  She's what?  She's doing the best she can.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Oh.  Good job, Sam.  And then they rushed you out, because obviously you were revving up, and you just started going 
[02:09:30]  there.  I always get the publicist to like me in the beginning, and then by the time the interview  is over, they won't talk to me anymore.  Because you're a little in cherubish.  Yeah.  So you could go up, and they go, oh, here's a young lad trying to make his way into the broadcast  business.  And then you come up, and you're a sarcastic ass.  Yeah, they think you probably work for like a college radio station.  Yeah.  All right, let the kid have a couple questions.  I think they were nervous, because I was like, I'm here with CBS Radio.  And they were like, okay, yeah, do you have any credentials?  And I was like, no.  But, you know, it's right up the street, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:10:00]  And they asked me four times if I, you sure you don't have like any credentials at all  or a business card?  And I was like, no, not on me.  But I'm sure I could.  And okay, all right.  And they let me in anyway.  Okay, that's not, I guess, Sam, some credentials.  Yeah.  Well, sure.  Any credentials, Sam?  Just get him a hat with one of those little things that says press.  Yeah.  In the little hat band.  Oldie time fedora with the cards sticking out.  I'm with the press.  Here to get the scoop.  Those old cameras.  The scoop.  He's got to get the scoop. 
[02:10:30]  From Kate.  From stupid Kate.  We got to get out of here.  Bill Burr, Caroline's all weekend long, starting tonight through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Under Jimmy State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia.  All right.  Friday night, two shows.  One of them, I believe, is sold out.  They might both be, I'm not sure, but go to Ticketmaster.  Nice.  And I will be in D.C. Friday night.  And now we're off to Sirius XM.  That's right.  Bill Burr will be filling in for you tomorrow.  Tomorrow, yeah.  Like the old days.  If we're here.  Well, we'll be somewhere. 
[02:11:00]  But if this is our last show for regular radio, it's been fun and we'll pop up again sometime.  We just want to say goodbye every day.  Because for once, I want to be able to say goodbye to the listeners.  Ugh.  All right.  We're out.  All right.  All right.  We continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Bill Burr in studio.  He's going to be with us tomorrow, too, which is very, very cool.  Nice.  Wearing your NFL players hat.  Yeah.  You don't want to commit to anybody? 
[02:11:30]  No.  I ended up, you know, doing stand-up and met some guy who works for the union and he  got me some free stuff.  All right.  Why not a Pat's hat, though?  He couldn't get you a Pat's hat?  No, he got me some.  All right.  You just wanted to wear the...  This is just the latest.  Well, you know, I always end up wearing them to the gym and then they get all salty and  disgusting and then, like, I never have, like, the good hat that I'm wearing.  I just...  Whatever hat I'm wearing, I just wear it everywhere.  I actually throw them on in the washing machine.  Oh, you do?  Every so often.  With your do-rags?  No, not with my do-rags. 
[02:12:00]  I don't plan on wearing the do-rag much longer, as a matter of fact, tomorrow.  Don't go chasing waterfalls.  Yeah.  It's left eye.  Left eye there, yeah.  I, uh, yeah, I have the stitches coming out tomorrow, so I go back to wearing my hat.  What's up, Jimmy?  Until some hair grows in on the fucking monk, the monk spot on the back of my head.  That's all I'm thinking right now.  Early 90s R&B.  Show Bill the spot.  Never gonna get it.  Never gonna get it.  Show Bill, because we don't get to see Bill often. 
[02:12:30]  The monk, uh...  See, he's very open about what is going on.  Here we go.  Look at all that.  Wow, it's actually coming in.  Yeah.  Yes.  It looks very natural.  There was nothing there.  That's crazy.  There was nothing there.  You know what?  That really does look...  And then, and then over here, this, like...  Yeah, look at that.  They increased the hairline a little in the front.  They reseated you.  They put there.  Same thing.  But, uh, that's very, like...  Nice. 
[02:13:00]  What did you do?  Did you come on my back?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, it actually does look good.  It's creepy.  It doesn't look like plugs.  It looks like you just had...  Like, you shaved there, and it just comes back in.  Yeah, it looks like it's growing in from, like, a shaved head or something.  Yeah.  That's what it looks like.  Oh, I'd love to duct tape that.  I was like gonna...  Just yank it out of my head.  Ten hours of surgery out the window.  All my follicles would come out.  You'd be laying there holding your head just like fucking Leonard Lawrence after a fucking  blanket party.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[02:13:30]  My favorite line in all that is, why?  Why?  Because you're a fat, stupid lump of shit that doesn't know how to play well with your  other soldiers.  I love cowboy.  Ralphie May.  I didn't say that.  Shut up.  What did we do that you're saying that about Ralphie?  We should drug Anthony and bring him to one of those Asian joints and have it just waxed  off.  Oh!  Oh, after all that time and money.  Give him the date rape drug.  That would suck.  Take care of our pal.  Walk in there, legless.  Right. 
[02:14:00]  That would really suck.  Bill's a big sports guy, and Danny, I need your help with this.  I really don't know what the...  Danny just got his finger in the door.  I saw the whole thing, and I started laughing.  It's not like that door weighs a thousand pounds, either.  So you should be all right.  Nice chunk of skin came off.  Yeah, it's not like a little light pantry door.  It doesn't build up a lot of momentum when you barely move it.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, literal gym.  As the air is sucked out of the room and the door starts slamming on your fucking hand.  Why'd you do that? 
[02:14:30]  I don't know what I did.  I have no idea how I could have physically have done that.  Yeah.  Hey, what's this NHL audio?  Oh, yeah.  I found this this morning, basically just because of the whole banning of, what's his  name now?  Sean Avery.  Yeah, Sean Avery for saying sloppy seconds.  I mean, it was such a little nothing thing.  And this is just a typical...  Before you jump in, because Bill had a great line in the office.  Sean Avery gets suspended for sloppy seconds, but he doesn't get suspended for trying to 
[02:15:00]  end people's careers on the ice.  Trying to blow up people's knees.  That's fine.  That's fine.  You know, five minutes, maybe.  Four minutes roughing.  Give you a boarding call.  But you say sloppy seconds.  All right, now wait a minute.  This is the NHL.  This is the NHL here.  Yeah.  There's dignity here.  Yeah.  And these are two professional athletes, and you know that there's trash talking in  every single sport.  And this is just an example of some of the stuff that I'm sure goes down on the ice pretty  much every game.  The pussifying of America continues.  Absolutely. 
[02:15:30]  It's hit hockey.  Come on.  It's a break.  Pussification.  If anybody from the NHL is listening, just accept the fact that you're a rogue sport.  You're never going to be as big as baseball.  Yeah, it's not going to be America's sport.  It's great.  Have you gone to a hockey game lately?  They're trying to be fucking family friendly.  It's just driving me nuts.  Hockey's back, though, man.  It's way better than it was before the strike.  They're starting to allow them to fight a little bit more and stuff, but...  Are they, yeah?  A little bit, but...  Yeah, just don't call anybody a name.  I think it's great again.  I think the NHL is great again.  But they're still doing a little bit of that crap where a fight starts, and they're real 
[02:16:00]  lazy about getting the camera over to it.  Oh, come on.  Well, you know what?  There's kids watching it, and you don't want to encourage that.  Does it look like old Jerry Springer episodes where they only cut to them fighting when they're  not fighting?  Yeah, yeah.  They went through that phase until the ratings break.  They're still doing a much better job, but they do it a little bit.  I'll tell you, the Dallas Stars are one of the most fun teams to watch just because  they got that... 
[02:16:30]  Was it Steve Ott?  They got two guys...  Animals.  Yeah, just...  They got animals.  Just starting shit.  Yeah, they just got animals.  They're bringing back the animals.  You can tell those guys.  They can barely skate.  They have one job.  Get on the ice and beat the shit out of somebody.  I miss those days.  And the goal scorers are getting annoyed.  Like, Mike Modano after one of the games is like, you know, if this is the way it's going  to be, I got to go get a desk job or something.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Shut up.  Claude Lemieux is coming back with the Sharks.  Yeah?  43 years old.  Oh, my God.  43 playing hockey. 
[02:17:00]  God, that's crazy.  Exactly.  We were talking about that earlier.  Like, get out of bed.  Can't even go ice skating.  Never mind having people, like, hitting you and having to do something.  I mean, just going ice skating.  Oh, you know you're going to fall down one time, and the next day you wake up, you got that  red and purple bruise, just burst blood vessels that'll never mend right.  Yeah, like six months later.  Well, speaking of which, we go back in time, and we get some trash talking.  We do that.  Yeah, this is actually from, I believe this is from, like, playoffs, from, like, 1991 season. 
[02:17:30]  And it's just, it's two players just going at it.  I don't know the history of the clip.  I don't know why they were trash talking each other, but this is just an example of stuff  that I'm sure goes down almost every NHL game.  Meanwhile, people are getting suspended for dumb words that they say.  Well, why are we two trash talking each other?  I don't know.  That's just a playoff.  Oh, Jesus.  I fell for it too.  Can we never listen to the show?  Tim in Cleveland, before we play the clip, he's got a good point here about trash talking.  Tim?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Timmy. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, I was just wondering why, you know, we got a big deal about this, and nobody seemed  to have much of a problem when Shaq asked Kobe how his ass tastes in front of a club.  Oh, yeah.  That's the best clips ever.  How's my ass taste?  Yeah, that was a biggie.  Yeah, he probably should have been suspended for that one.  Yeah, probably.  Shaq is hilarious.  He really...  How's my ass taste?  He let him have it.  You know what he's been hanging out?  He had an incident recently, too, in Noam's place.  Not the comedy cellar, but around the corner.  I think the fat black pussycat.  Noam owns that. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  And Shaq has been hanging out there.  I am.  Yeah.  And there was some kind of an incident where some guy tried to piss on him or some shit  like that.  What?  Why would you do that?  Why would you try to piss on Shaq?  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Punch me.  Let's get this over with.  I need some money.  Right.  Need some quick cash.  All right.  Here's the clip from 1991.  Yep.  You must be drawing your fellows.  Off the fucking ice, you faggot.  That's a good one. 
[02:19:00]  It goes on, but we got to...  The fucking ice, you faggot.  That's my gun.  For some reason, there was some bust of the big drug bust, and the reporter's holding  up a gun that I actually own.  It looks like a suitcase.  Perhaps they were...  He's holding up one of the weapons.  I own that gun.  That's the FS, right?  Yeah.  It looks like a suitcase for a French horn.  How do you shoot that thing?  Or for like a drill.  Right.  Sure.  That's hysterical, because obviously, he's holding it up for some kind of dramatic purpose. 
[02:19:30]  Like, and here's one of the weapons that was seen.  It's like, I got that.  I own that motherfucker.  It's one of those video game guns.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah.  Those things are great.  All right.  Back to...  Hey, who is this guy yelling?  I don't know.  Stupid me.  I wrote it on the actual disc itself.  I think that was Paul Hargis.  Kevin Stevens.  Kevin Stevens and Brian...  Oh, Brian Trottson.  No shit.  Oh, that was Trottson.  I'm glad you said it, because I always said Trottier. 
[02:20:00]  Trottier.  That's Trottson.  Remember he had all the street hockey gear?  He was making a killing with that stuff.  He got old, like they all do.  What was that?  Dennis Potvin.  One of those Islander guys.  Beat your wife, Potvin.  Beat your wife, Potvin.  The chants that you used to hear at...  Not used to.  They still do that one.  Oh, they still do that one?  Oh, the fucking Rangers.  They're relentless.  He hasn't been on the ice in 20 years.  Celtics fans did that to Jason Kidd.  When he got busted for, you know, whatever, domestic violence. 
[02:20:30]  Somebody literally made a sign and had like a cross and literally had hung a wife beater  from it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  It was brutal.  It was brutal.  What a brilliant thing, though.  It's just a t-shirt.  What a brilliant...  I'm sure that guy got kicked out of the arena for doing that.  That stuff's great, though, man.  God forbid the fans try to have a little fun.  Yeah.  They banned the Boston Sucks shirts at Yankee Stadium and all that shit.  Well, it's just too mean-spirited.  Like, I always like the chants of like, you know, go get them, Yanks.  I'll just... 
[02:21:00]  Oof, oof.  I'll just...  Let me know.  P-U.  I'll just...  Take it?  Take it like a man?  I'll just take it.  Can I just point out that all those car CEO executive guys in the backseat of a four-door  sedan is really, really amusing?  I would...  I saw that, too.  You know, the...  Obviously, the three CEOs for the big three automakers are in Washington.  They're trying to get money to bail them out because they're all in the shitter. 
[02:21:30]  So they were chastised the other day, at least the General Motors guy, for flying in,  using his private jet to fly in.  And it's like you cry in poverty and you're flying in a private jet.  So now, like, this isn't some calculated fucking move.  They're all driving in in hybrid vehicles.  Driving.  It's like, why not just take a...  I don't think anybody would fault the CEO if they've got him a first-class ticket on  American Airlines.  I don't think anybody would fault that.  It's a business trip, of course.  You fly in a commercial airline. 
[02:22:00]  If you fly in a private jet, you're going to catch shit.  But if you fly, you know, a regular airline...  But now it's like, look at us.  Could you please...  It's like when they...  You see a fucking murderer and it's just a savage fucking animal that they caught,  his mugshot and everything.  And then in court, they're all clean-shaved, haircut, in a suit.  And they're like, this guy's never looked like this.  Right.  Ever.  Do you think the CEOs are fighting in the backseat?  He's touching me.  He's touching me.  Don't make me turn this around.  No, they're probably arguing over who's the bigger piece of shit that has helped drive a 
[02:22:30]  fucking nail into the coffin of this country.  Yes.  I've fucked more people who've dedicated their lives to the company.  Oh, I say you haven't.  I'm the bigger scumbag out of all of us.  I should take a bigger pay cut.  No, I should.  How come they're getting so much shit and the bankers didn't?  That's what I don't understand.  Yeah, that's an odd thing.  They stole three quarters of a trillion dollars.  We're going to help you guys out.  You know what?  Actually, we're going to keep it and buy other banks.  I think the government had their hands so far into the banking industry anyway with 
[02:23:00]  the lawmakers and the deregulation, the power that they gave these banks that wound up turning  into the fucking, that they had to do something or else it was going to get to the point where  it's like, oh shit, wait a minute, I'm to blame?  So they threw money at the banks.  The automakers, though, they dug their own grave pumping out fucking SUVs while gasses  at $4 a gallon.  But we just gave them three quarters of a trillion dollars that they were going to 
[02:23:30]  help us with and then they decided to keep it because stuff changed over like two months.  Yeah, so now they're buying other banks with it and they're using it as just capital, as  liquid assets that they have.  Yeah, and they're charging me like three times the fees.  Yeah.  I didn't do shit.  This wasn't a bailout.  It was like, here, here's some cash.  Business as usual, but now you have a lot more money.  Yeah.  Frightening what has happened.  I'm waiting for the big downfall.  Uh, the other day, I guess yesterday, um, a Russian, uh, battleship and a few other 
[02:24:00]  ships went through the Panama Canal for the first time since World War II and, um, they  had a little meeting with Venezuela, another country that just loves us.  And it's all adding up to the United States is becoming just nothing.  Vulnerable.  We're becoming this, uh, we're, soon we'll be a third world nation, relatively soon.  But in the meantime, we're just losing any power and any influence we had in the world  because we're, we're like a joke now.  Uh, Europe is all happy and friendly with each other. 
[02:24:30]  They got their own fucking money now.  Germany seems to be in check for the time being.  No, they don't, no.  They're, they're, they're where we're going to be.  Their Euro?  Yeah, they're going to put us all on the Amero.  This all goes back to one world bank, one world government.  That's what they're going to.  They already did it.  Oh, I love this.  This is, uh, the Illuminati.  No, it isn't, dude.  No, I know.  It's like, they want to have the Amerigo where, where it's like Canada.  I get so much shit for this conspiracy theory stuff.  All this shit that's happening, I read about this like a year ago on the internet, which  of course the internet, man, the internet lies. 
[02:25:00]  TV's telling you the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  But the internet, that's all lies.  It's, dude, I'm telling you.  They, the only way we would ever get off the dollars if they so fucking devalued it.  And that's exactly what they're doing.  NAFTA made no sense.  Hey, let's take all, all the industry from this country and give it to other people and  fuck everybody here and stick them in cubicles.  And this is like the last thing that they can fuck us on is, is the big three.  These are the guys who made the tanks and the jeeps when we go to war.  Right, right, right.  We're going to get rid of this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  The fucking Somalian pirates can take us over at this point.  We love those stories. 
[02:25:30]  But one global bank, not necessarily one bank, but one, one monetary unit, one unit as a  planet is actually advancement.  I mean, it's, it's, it eventually, yeah, a planetary unit as, is actually.  How is that?  Because.  That gives a lot of power to someone.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about that.  Some entity.  I'm talking about beyond that.  Eventually, when we're not breaking ourselves down into different.  Quat lubes.  When you're looking at like, like, and Dr. Kaku talks about that.  When you're looking at like, uh, planetary things like, like colonizing the moon or advancing 
[02:26:00]  in space, Earth is going to have to be one group.  Can't happen.  It will, though.  Of course it will.  To me, like individualism, I know it sounds crazy, is a part of being primitive.  Um, as we advance.  They're setting up an aristocracy group.  You're a commie.  No, no, no.  They're not commies.  They're not bringing us together.  I'm not about them even.  I'm talking about as a, as a group, as we all eventually, it will all work itself out.  It's just going to take a long, long, long time.  But to, to colonize the moon and to branch out into space, it's, no one's going to say. 
[02:26:30]  Is he still in a bit right now?  No.  A hundred percent.  Is he actually serious?  No, he's serious.  A hundred percent serious.  He's still a bust ring.  A hundred percent serious.  Listen to like Dr. Kaku when he talks about, uh.  Dr. Kaku ring?  When he talks about like, uh, planetary powers and advancement of a species.  Um, like you're.  But we're not ready to wing off and start commerce with Saturn.  No, not yet we are.  But you have to start.  So I'm talking about like, going out into space and utilizing, uh, uh, uh, stuff like that  as opposed to just like, uh, fucking earth resources.  Banks are nothing more, it's legalized extortion. 
[02:27:00]  I might even talk about, I'm not talking about the banks.  That's all it is.  Dude, 27% interest rate.  What point is a usury?  They're, they're awful.  They're rapists.  They should be shot.  I'm not talking about that.  You know what kills me is the entire world is run by those guys you didn't pick in fucking  gym class.  Those people who struck out playing kickball.  The Jews.  No, banks.  But I'm not.  Why you always got to, dude, it's blue bloods.  Blue bloods?  Blue bloods.  Straight across, yeah.  But I'm not talking.  Rock the rock and fellas, all those guys.  I'm not talking about them, I'm not even saying you're wrong.  I'm not talking about them.  I'm talking about.  You're talking about colonizing, colonizing space. 
[02:27:30]  But it's a reality, it's where we're headed.  I'm talking about MasterCard.  It's where we're headed.  It's like, when you look beyond as a species, I'm not just talking about the next 100 or 200  years.  When you look as a species, people talk about space travel and advanced civilizations.  Picture a thousand years or 2,000 years into our evolution as a species.  Are we still going to be broken down into states?  And fuck, are we going to be like, this is, the earth is one unit.  Do you think that's a good thing?  Of course it is.  How is that a good thing?  When certain cultures advance faster and better than other cultures? 
[02:28:00]  It will eventually become a planetary culture.  Oh, please.  But again, dude, it might be 5,000 years from now.  But eventually, that to me is going to happen.  5,000 years.  We're talking about maybe 20 years.  We're talking about the whole population problem right now to the point we're melting the ice  on top of this planet.  That's what they're talking about, Colin.  Exactly.  So what they're going to end up doing is there's going to be a bunch of people who are going  to get processed.  Dude, I swear to God, I was watching this thing on Hitler the other day.  Hey, yeah.  I watch those all the time.  When they got in control in Parliament or whatever their branch of government was, they signed, 
[02:28:30]  they passed through this whole pact that basically all of a sudden they could start arresting  people without charging them, detaining them.  It was the fucking Patriot Act.  It's the same thing, dude.  Like, I don't know what's...  I feel like I'm living in Germany in 1931 right now.  Ah, if only.  And we're all sitting here going like...  Oh, dare to dream with beer steins in our hands.  Just having fun.  You know what the thing is?  Anthony thinks he's going to make the cut.  He thinks he's making the team.  I would make the team. 
[02:29:00]  You're not making the team.  I'm making the team.  You're going to meet a railroad car right next to me.  What are your skills?  What are your skills when they take the detention camp?  I'm essential to the war effort.  He's a great shoveler.  When they take it into the detention camp, what are you going to say?  I talk shit into a microphone for 20 years?  I am very influential.  I could be a minister of propaganda.  I am asking the questions.  Do you have any science background?  Yes, of course.  Explain your mustache.  I'll lie.  I could be a minister of propaganda.  Why is it longer than the furors?  I could spread the word that needs to be spread amongst the people, the common people. 
[02:29:30]  The best you can hope for is you're going to be sitting in a trench like it's 1918.  With tear gas being thrown at me.  You're going to be the guy who's going to sing Silent Night on New Year's Eve.  And get one between the eyes an hour before the war ends.  Don't you see how we have this?  And again, we're in the minuscule part of what's eventually going to happen.  When you look at...  I'm not talking about the banking scumbag.  On a bigger picture, when you look at the cosmonauts in the space station or the Russians 
[02:30:00]  and the Americans, and now we're talking about going to Mars.  That's all about colonizing fucking moons.  And it's not just about overpopulation.  It's about certain natural disasters will eventually threaten the Earth.  Jim, there's no atmosphere.  You can't colonize those places.  Of course you have to make a creative false atmosphere or something.  We call them shaken bay colonies.  We absolutely...  Sham wow moon.  We absolutely will eventually live on other places.  We're going to end up going to LV-426 and set up a shaken bay colony. 
[02:30:30]  No, we're not.  What they're going to do is they're going to fucking eliminate...  You know, the company manufactures these.  A good three, four billion people.  They're going to be processed.  And then, you know, I don't know.  There's going to be a gated community and servants.  You think that's it?  That kind of class?  We're going back to a feudal system.  Feudal system.  Survival of the species dictates that we have to be able to eventually move from where we are now.  I can't agree with Jimmy.  Well, you know, you can kind of talk about what might happen in 5,000 years. 
[02:31:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  It's all speculation.  Yes.  The thing is, all of our technology that we have is based on where you're from and what was necessary for the time.  Space travel, the only fucking reason we did that was to show the Soviets, who we hated, that we were better than them.  And the reason that they had their program was that if there's no competition in this world,  we're not going to all join together for the good of science to do anything. 
[02:31:30]  We base our whole technology, our whole advancement and evolution is based on hating someone else.  Which, beyond that, is a need to survive ourselves.  It's not just the anger.  Beneath that is my hatred of you as a threat to my survival.  So it's like when you look at Kama Shoemaker leading hitting Jupiter was a major event  because it made clouds that were the size of our planet.  And the Earth gets battered all the time.  The moon has obviously been battered.  It's not crazy that something a quarter mile long will hit the planet. 
[02:32:00]  That's not out of the realm of speculation.  And eventually we'll be able to see that happening.  It's a necessary part of survival.  That would be a godsend compared to fucking walking around with a microchip  with all your information on it.  And if you fuck with the deal, they turn your chip off and you become homeless.  And they're not going to totally turn it off.  They'll just turn off all the financial shit.  So then all of a sudden you're saying that you walk around and the chip is your life. 
[02:32:30]  It's all your information, your financial information.  And then if you fuck with the system, they shut your chip off.  And all of a sudden you don't own your house anymore.  You have no money, no car, and you're homeless.  You're out.  But they won't totally turn your chip off because they're still going to need to know where you are  because they can't have a group of chipless people all getting together.  If we mass together as chipless people, then you have power.  And then you all, yeah, you can't have that.  You'll be completely 100% fucked and they're going to be able to do it.  I love Phil Ver.  They're going to be able to do it and everybody's going to say the exact same stupid shit that 
[02:33:00]  they said when they started tapping our phones going, well, you know, if you ain't doing  nothing wrong, what's the problem?  Because you're taking away your ability to ever rebel against oppressive rulership.  Thank you.  That's why I feel strongly about the Second Amendment.  That's why people like Rosie O'Donnell do not understand the importance of the Second  Amendment, the right to bear arms.  Yeah.  Let's just have the government and bad guys be armed and the rest of us will be sitting  here like fucking idiots.  We're already screwed, dude.  How do you, like back in the day, you could actually put together a militia and have a 
[02:33:30]  good, you know, standoff, a good scrum, you know, packing it.  Now, what am I going to do with some guy in an F-16 and I got my little, my paintball  gun.  But the thing is, look at how rebels have done, how well they've done in Afghanistan against the  Soviet Union, in Iraq against the United States.  That's true.  They usually, just an armed with basic weapons public that is outraged at an army doing shit  has done very well. 
[02:34:00]  Vietnam is another prime example.  We out fucking, outplayed them as far as equipment goes tenfold, even more.  And they kicked our ass, threw us right the fuck out of there.  Dude, when you got the commitment to be like, did you ever see the footage of that one-legged  soldier with the AK-47?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jumping around and shooting that fucking thing.  If you're going to fight to that level, it's just like, it's just not happening.  I just can't picture Americans being on that level.  Like, I always said, I can never picture an American, a bunch of American refugees having 
[02:34:30]  to go into Mexico and Canada, just streaming in with like, like when you see refugees,  they have their kids hanging on a tit and something, maybe a change of clothes on their head.  And we'd be like with our nice rolling suitcases and with useless makeup and shit.  I'm going to tell you, dude.  And just horrible stuff.  It would come back quick.  That Viking DNA.  You think?  Look at the history of this country.  Well, hopefully those people that would need that shit would be gone.  Just fucking gone. 
[02:35:00]  And the people that are a little stronger and can survive off of the fucking land might  be that, you know, sometimes you need a good purge, purging of these motherfucking assholes  to rebuild on.  Have you seen that commercial for the Duracell batteries?  Oh, yes.  That's an actual bit from my act.  You know, back in the day when they sold batteries, it was some guy in the rain, like,  oh, thank God I had batteries in my flashlight.  Now they're selling batteries.  Some woman can't find her kid in the park. 
[02:35:30]  Kevin?  Kevin?  Oh my God, Kevin.  And then she takes out that little device.  Tracking device.  And there comes fucking Kevin running over the hill.  And they're like, Duracell batteries.  It's like, dude, fuck the batteries.  What was that thing she just took out of the pocket?  That kid's sneakers weren't glowing.  He didn't have an antenna coming out of his head.  What the fuck was that?  Yeah, where was the other part of that?  Evidently, it's a band that has the microchip in it.  But they never show that part.  No.  Dude, they're gradually...  They're making us comfortable.  They're going to know.  Of the possibility. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  That's what they have done in it.  They're going to start with the commercial.  They're going to create a fear that if you don't do this to your kid, you're going to  lose your kid.  My big conspiracy theory is whatever they're doing to dogs, they're going to be doing  to us in 10 years.  Dogs right now are microchipped, castrated, sitting in shelters waiting to be rescued.  That's going to be us.  We're going to be in FEMA camps.  Avenge me!  Boys!  Avenge me!  Avenge me!  You forget that we're evolving, though.  You forget that we are...  We are not evolving. 
[02:36:30]  We're not.  Of course we are.  Physically, we absolutely are.  You need to read about banking and realize what's really going on, dude.  We're not evolving fast enough for how we're fucking ourselves up.  But look at where we were.  You want to go Cro-Magnon era to where we are now.  You think we just stop evolving?  We don't stop evolving.  Physically and mental capability hasn't changed.  Back in the day, we had the same brain area as a Cro-Magnon as we do now.  It was all just filling in what we were ignorant of.  The intelligence potential was always there, but we didn't know anything because we hadn't 
[02:37:00]  done anything.  It took a long time to figure shit out, but after we figured it out, that's just what  we do as humans.  We're very curious things.  Just because...  The physical evolutions take millions of years, though.  Like, the sharks really haven't evolved, but we are still evolving.  I'm telling you.  We are.  We're getting more connected mentally.  I doubt we're not evolving, but you know something?  It's not at this rapid rate where even in 5,000 years we're going to be any better than  we were, than we are now.  We suck.  We have hatred in us. 
[02:37:30]  We have primal instincts that prevent us from being united as a people.  Like a bunch of monkeys.  Like a bunch of monkeys.  We're animals that hate other people because they look different.  Just because you used to have a record player, and now you have an iPod.  That is another evolution.  That's not evolution.  Not at all.  Exactly.  And because they can listen to your phone calls now, that is not progress.  I'm not talking about that.  You're mistreating me.  I'm not saying that.  You're talking about Saturn.  Another fucking finger would be evolution, or fucking a dick growing out of your forehead  so you can eat ass while you fuck a girl is evolution. 
[02:38:00]  What do you think we said?  We didn't just show up here.  And you agree with her.  Yes, that sounds still good.  We didn't just show up here with two legs and two arms.  We came out of the fucking gunk millions of years ago.  I'm not talking about us evolving.  That's what's eventually going on.  Why do you think they're living above the Earth in a fucking, and I know there's probably  some paranoid reason, it is eventually to learn how to adapt to space, because we're  eventually going to have to move.  We're going to have to move.  That wasn't the initial idea.  We're talking about two different things here. 
[02:38:30]  I'm talking about how a lot of this shit that they used to tell me when I was a kid,  that I'm lucky I don't live in Russia, because now they can do this, is now they can do it.  Now they can pull up in a black van and just arrest you for nothing because they suspect  you of terrorism.  You never were able to do that shit.  You were never able to do that.  That's not evolution, dude.  That is losing.  I'm not saying it is evolution.  You're taking a conspiracy theory, and what I'm saying is...  The Patriot Act is not a conspiracy theory.  It's a document.  But you just said about pulling up and arresting people for no reason, and they're doing it 
[02:39:00]  like they used to do in Russia.  No, I'm saying they can't.  They can legally do that now.  They can't just arrest you without any...  Yes, they can.  Without any...  Yes, they can.  I don't believe you.  They can just walk in and arrest Anthony.  We suspect him of terrorism.  Yes.  Yes, yes, they can.  And absolutely no grounds for suspicion.  Yes, I don't believe it.  Yes.  I can't buy it.  You can't hold me.  Yeah, I don't buy it.  They can hold you indefinitely.  They can arrest you.  Jose Padilla, they held a definitely...  Under the Patriot Act.  Under the Patriot Act, all they have to do is declare him. 
[02:39:30]  What would I have to have done, though?  They just have to brand you suspected of terrorist activity.  For what?  What did I do?  What's proof?  Whatever they fucking can come up with.  They don't have proof.  They don't need it.  You know something?  Everyone down in Guantanamo...  I don't think there's some fucking guy that was working at, you know, a Jiffy Lube in Guantanamo  going...  Separate argument.  What the fuck happened?  You're making a separate argument from what I was making.  Completely separate argument.  Dude, the Patriot...  I was just talking about that.  You're right.  It is separate.  It is separate.  I'm just saying that what they're doing to them down there, they can do to you.  But, Bill, you're making a separate argument from what I was making. 
[02:40:00]  I was talking about something else.  Let's talk over each other.  You're not doing nothing.  You were talking about two different things.  You're not getting a separate argument from what I was making.  I wasn't making an argument.  The standing president can now suspend elections if they want to.  I'm not talking...  Indefinitely.  I'm not talking about the Patriot Act.  I'm not talking about, oh, we're going to get arrested.  I'm talking about as becoming...  You're talking about Europe becoming one, or the U.S. and South America, and all these  things eventually happening.  Yeah, there's a lot of shitty elements to it, but eventually we are going to become one  planetary unit. 
[02:40:30]  Like, as far...  We are going to.  And everybody's going to be Puerto Rican.  And the reason for that is for power.  It's not to evolve and to have world peace, dude.  I didn't say world peace, but power as a planet where we are eventually going to go out into  space and go to other places.  That's eventually going to happen.  This is one of these arguments where neither person can hear what the other person is saying.  But I am here, but we're having two different arguments.  I don't know what you're saying.  You're using conspiracy theories and stuff.  This is two different arguments.  I know it is.  I'm not using...  Patriot Act is not conspiracy theory. 
[02:41:00]  But you're acting like any...  The dog thing.  I made a little funny there.  Yeah.  Okay, I'll give you that.  It is supposed to be a comedy show.  But the Patriot Act is not a conspiracy theory.  But Americans are not just being sapped up and thrown in jail by black vans.  You know, Jimmy, one of my things on my to-do list today is to buy your book.  Okay?  Okay.  And I'm going to tell you, if we're going to continue to argue like this...  Which one?  They're both best-semmers.  I'm just joking.  When I'm arguing about it, dude, you don't like the fact that I'm talking about something  else.  I'm talking about something else.  This is a different...  I was trying to have a funny way out of this.  No, there's two different arguments going on here. 
[02:41:30]  I'm saying...  Two completely different arguments.  I was only...  When you were saying that we're becoming...  I was saying that Europe is one unit and the U.S. is becoming this...  The United States of North America.  That there's not...  It's not always...  It's not all awful that we become like one group as a planet.  I think it is.  Fuck the bankers.  I'm not talking about...  I even said...  Yeah, fuck the bankers.  They just created all this...  You know, what you're doing is...  I said I wasn't disagreeing with you.  And I said that.  I said I'm not even saying you're wrong about that shit.  I'm talking about another part of it.  Becoming one group as a planet is not a bad thing. 
[02:42:00]  I even said I wasn't disagreeing with you.  I don't think it raises us up.  I think it lowers us to everybody else's level.  That's what the thing is.  America's been its elite nation.  And then by watering us down, it doesn't make us better.  Every empire falls.  Get used to it.  The Romans, the fucking Dengis Khan, they ruled a lot longer than we did.  And they went down the fucking toilet.  It happens to everyone.  We are going to go.  I don't know why we think we're so different.  We're not.  What about the difference in religion, though?  How does that play out in your future? 
[02:42:30]  Eventually, if there's ever...  Here's what happens.  You find life on another planet.  They now just recently photographed for the first time other planets.  They're not just the fucking blip of a star going around something.  They actually have a photograph of a distant heat or whatever coming off a planet.  Once life is fucking confirmed on other planets, and it becomes a part of what we know to be the truth.  Oh, religions will fight it.  We'll run around like monkeys.  To me, religions are a sign of being primitive.  They will eventually go away. 
[02:43:00]  Absolutely.  Eventually, in time, over thousands and thousands of years of evolution and of evolution of thinking, they will eventually go away.  Just like the fact that when we look at what Zeus and all that shit, that no longer holds water.  I'm not saying that the nonsense hasn't changed, but once we find life on other planets and it's confirmed, and more than just a water molecule, once we have the ability to confirm life on other planets, the idea of religion will absolutely change.  And a lot of it will be lost.  Did you get this knowledge from Yale? 
[02:43:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying anything crazy either.  I think Bill and I are talking about two massively different scales.  Yeah, we were having a conversation about one thing, and then you jumped in with this planetary stuff.  Well, I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  I'm sorry.  I was on the show, too.  I didn't mean to jump in and wreck things.  I didn't say you couldn't go in, but you completely changed the subject.  That's why I don't understand what you're saying.  I didn't mean to change the whole common ground here.  The common ground was you just made me think of something when you were talking about Europe as a whole. 
[02:44:00]  Now Europe is this whole thing.  And I would say I agree with you to a certain point, but I didn't think in the end game that us being one thing is a bad, like there's shitty parts of it, but eventually we are going to wind up that way.  So even though there's shitty elements to Europe being a part of usually one monetary unit, and there's dangerous aspects to it, I do think that eventually that's where we're headed anyway.  I don't disagree with you, Jimmy, but how long would that take?  Oh, I don't know.  That's why I said I don't know why Bill's so irritated that I jumped in with that. 
[02:44:30]  I'm not irritated.  I was trying to understand what you were saying, but I was saying we were talking about like, whatever.  I don't know how to make this to simplify.  Say we were talking about Dunkin' Donuts down the street.  You started talking about malls of the future.  But not out of nowhere, because you made me think of something.  I'm not saying you're wrong, Jim.  I just didn't get what you were saying.  Now I kind of understand what you're saying.  I don't even understand how it relates to what we were talking about, but I'm an idiot.  Well, I'll explain to you how it connects to what you were saying. 
[02:45:00]  With the Euro and Europe being one entity as far as money goes.  And then you went into, well, the Americas are all going to be one.  North America, South America, yeah.  And then I was saying that individualism in countries, the idea of that is going to go away eventually anyway.  Not discounting that the bankers are scumbagged in what you're saying.  Not discounting any of that.  Okay, but my thing about it is, Jim, is us being separate is not like, they're not getting rid of that because that's a primitive way of thinking.  I'm not talking about...  If I could finish.  Oh, go ahead, sorry. 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  The reason why they're doing that is because they want to have one world bank that prints the currency for the entire world at interest.  And which basically financially enslaves the entire world.  You make a ton of fucking cash.  That's why they're doing it.  Not to help people, not to end wars, not to make shit better.  I'm not talking about they.  Who is they?  It's us.  No.  Who is they?  I'm talking about it as a species.  We're people.  I don't look at it like there's a magical they.  No, I'm not.  I'm talking about like the Federal Reserve.  You read about the Federal Reserve, dude.  They print the money for this country at interest.  You can't get out of debt with that. 
[02:46:00]  It's a private corporation.  It's not a government...  The Federal Reserve is not a governmental entity.  It's a private corporation that prints the money for this country.  Okay, so I can't disprove what you're saying.  You can't prove what you're saying.  That's why maybe you're right about what the Federal Reserve is.  But you can't prove where this is going to go.  I can send you to some information that I...  You're saying that we're all going to be slaves to one world government.  Dude, have you ever done the math on your mortgage?  Um, kind of, yeah.  That's why I pay into the principal.  I have a $350,000 loan. 
[02:46:30]  If I take 30 years to pay it, I pay back $766,000.  Yes, that's why I pay into the principal.  Yes, I have done the math.  I do that, too.  How is that fucking...  And this is basically the brilliance of it.  How is that legal, right?  Exactly.  How is that fucking legal?  It is sickening.  Dude, you remember back in the day, you had a couple friends.  You got together.  You fucking built a log cabin.  You had a house-raising party.  It was over.  You didn't have to fucking work at Staples for 30 years.  Then, by the time you're done...  And people are so fucking stupid.  At the end of their loan, they're like,  I paid $350,000 for it.  Now it's worth $800,000. 
[02:47:00]  No, stupid.  You paid $750,000.  Right.  You had to put a new roof on it.  The above-ground pool collapsed.  That cost you $3,000 to fucking sweep that up.  You made $1,000 over 30 years.  Now you're 68.  What, are you going to take up water skiing?  It's fucking over.  It's over.  And then, because they print the money,  they cause inflation.  You can't afford property tax.  Then you got to sell it.  They move another 30-year-old in.  They bend him over for fucking 30 years.  That's what they're doing, dude.  Well, you're not going to get an argument out of me  about the banks being pieces of shit.  I mean, no one's arguing that point. 
[02:47:30]  But it's like generation after generation survives.  I don't know why you think it's all coming to an end  and we're all going to fall into the toilet.  We eventually, generation after generation, survive.  I'm saying that these fucks keep taking another slice  out of everybody as you keep continuing on  and they're getting richer and we're getting poorer.  That's not evolution, Jim.  They're creating an aristocracy.  Us going to a global economy is a part of our evolution.  It's going to happen.  Us going to a global... 
[02:48:00]  For evil purposes, Jim.  Not to help us.  It's not always for evil purposes.  So if we eventually branch out and colonize the moon  and colonize one of Jupiter's moons,  that's for evil purposes?  Like, where does it stop?  When does our natural evolution take over  or become a part of the theory?  Jim, I know nothing about colonizing other planets.  But it's not as crazy as you think.  How do you have a war with somebody  that you're sharing a monetary thing?  Like, you're sharing the same money. 
[02:48:30]  I'm not saying you won't get another weapon.  Like, under Jimmy's thing here  of one united earth  with a single denomination of currency,  how do you then fight a war?  Isn't there a conflict of interest with the bank?  Dude...  With the bank?  When you're fighting a war?  Like, how do you divvy up the money?  If you look at someone like the higher...  Like, people have money on both sides of wars.  I don't know.  Yeah, dude, these are huge fucking questions.  But all I know is that, you know, 
[02:49:00]  the direction they're going in, man,  is that they're trying to get everybody  in the world underneath the thumb of that.  Have one bank,  have everybody in that mortgage-ass fucking...  And it's just continually going to get worse and worse.  Who are the guys?  Who are the fucking aristocracy here?  Who is they?  Who is they?  I just want to know who they are.  Whoever's behind the Federal Reserve.  Whoever created...  I mean, the J.P. Morgans,  the Rothschild families.  I mean, it's not...  Those are old. 
[02:49:30]  Like, they've been around for forever.  But they don't even seem to have the influence  that they used to have back...  Have you read any stuff?  Do you read that book,  The Case Against the Federal Reserve?  No, no, I didn't read that.  Just read up on that type of stuff, too.  Believe me.  I just know these old families seem...  I'm literally one inch into this shit,  and it makes way more sense  than any crap I see on TV.  And I can't intelligently debate this thing  all the way down to  who the fuck is running this shit.  I don't fucking know.  But when I read stuff like that,  it makes way more sense to me 
[02:50:00]  than they don't like us  because they don't like freedom,  they're just jealous,  or any of this bullshit  that they just throw none of it.  Or a politician who just stands there up,  I think it's time to get America back to work!  And I mean, yay!  It's like, dude, you're not saying anything.  One of the greatest ways they control people  is with religion.  Once religion goes,  and eventually it will go,  once that goes,  then a tremendous element  of our thinking and our psyche  as beings changes. 
[02:50:30]  We'll always hate people  that are different from us.  I don't know about that.  We always will.  Dude, I don't know about that.  How come when there's a plane...  It's a natural state of human beings.  It's a natural state of humanity.  You're absolutely right.  At this point, yes.  You're probably right.  At this point,  our stupid evolution,  you're probably right.  When there's a plane crash  in a country  or an earthquake or something,  the news has to report  how many Americans were killed.  Yeah.  Because you care more about them  than you do the indigenous people  of whatever catastrophe happened.  When I see bodies  of people in Asia  laid out from a typhoon, 
[02:51:00]  a hurricane,  whatever the hell happens,  an earthquake,  I don't care as much  as I do  when I see a natural disaster  or a terrorist event  that killed Americans  and you see American bodies.  The news won't show  American dead people  as often as they'll show  foreign dead people.  And it's because  we don't have the caring  for those people  as we do for our own people.  And it's this concocted thing.  We just made up the borders  and everything. 
[02:51:30]  But there's a caring.  There's a unity  that we have  that is ingrained in us  as a people.  We don't like  different people.  Is it ingrained in us  or is it trained?  Is it like...  I think it's instinctual.  I think it's ingrained in us.  It has some kind of a thing  that was put in there  for protection.  You watch kids  play in a sandbox.  There's always the alpha male.  He's running shit.  Kids get jealous.  It's so primitive.  They steal toys.  They fucking hit each other. 
[02:52:00]  The strong one  makes the weak one  cry and run away.  Just like they used  to drag women in.  Again, it's a part  of evolving.  We are in a weird way  talking about the same thing.  That's not evolution either  because you still  want to grab women  and just fuck them  in the street.  It's natural.  But you can't.  Evolution and stuff.  It is natural.  You still want to.  It's just you evolve.  You change.  I'm telling you,  it happens.  It's just a very  fucking slow process.  We're not all talking.  The alpha male  is not going to ever go away  unless you did  like a Planet of the Apes  fucking surgery 
[02:52:30]  on the side of people's heads.  You cut out his brain.  Or unless evolution dictates  that you don't need  to be an alpha male  to survive.  Unless we go to a point  which we,  it's again,  you know,  we're talking.  So if women  would just start  fucking nerds,  there would be no reason  to be the star  of the football team.  Nah,  but it all comes down  to provide,  like,  do women really know,  like,  it's a biological thing.  It's an evolutionary thing  of how they fucking  want to get knocked up  by a certain age  because they got that clock.  You know what I mean?  It's all internal stuff.  So you think dogs  will ever change  and cats 
[02:53:00]  and fucking penguins  where they'll all of a sudden  start,  well,  that was due to our  I don't know,  sharks haven't changed  in 60 million years  so maybe we are at the end.  But we've changed a lot  in X amount of years.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know.  But we really haven't.  It's like Bill said,  getting a fucking CD player  instead of a Victrola  is not evolution.  It's technological advancement  just from us becoming  more informed on things  through learning,  not evolution.  Our brains did not get 
[02:53:30]  any smarter  between the time  we were fucking  carving arrowheads  and now  we just figured  more shit out  and stored it  in our brains  that were the same  when we were cavemen.  Okay,  maybe that's where  the rest of the evolution  comes from then.  Maybe it's not this physical thing.  Maybe it's mental  or whatever it is.  And the hatred  of other people  and other nationalities  and other races  won't go away  and the alpha male thing  won't go away.  This is something  ingrained in humanity  that I can't believe  in 5,000, 10,000,  50,000 fucking years  is ever going to go away. 
[02:54:00]  Well, if Europe  can like each other,  how can they...  They don't!  They fucking hate each other.  But we're able to work together.  He was saying  that Europe should love...  They're united  in the hatred  of the United States.  Whatever they're united in,  they are united.  And we eventually  won't look at it like,  oh, he's different  because he's this  or he's different  because he's that.  Do you think the Germans  like the French?  Not really.  They fucking hate them  as much as they did  during the war.  But they're united  on a necessity.  They're united  so they can have  the same currency  so they can do  their fucking Amway scam.  That's why.  The Amway scam.  So where do you see us 
[02:54:30]  in like, say, 2,000 years  or 3,000 years?  Different borders,  being the same thing?  Same assholes,  running things.  So what do you think  happens when we discover  life on another planet?  Jimmy, somebody is always  going to want to fuck  somebody's hot girlfriend.  Yeah, I understand that.  It's always going to happen.  Do you know, there are people  that have an absolute belief  that there is  a life on other planets  that still have  an unbelievable belief  in God  and religion  and Christianity.  So even if they discovered  other life,  they'd still fucking  pray to their God. 
[02:55:00]  Well, just to have us  on Europe  that would go away.  You think?  Yes, I do.  Just to have people on Earth  is an incredible waste  of space for the universe.  What is the purpose  of everything else?  Everything has a purpose, right?  Supposedly.  Is that all that other shit  to make us feel  how lucky we are?  That's just us.  It gives us this mystery.  We need a mystery  so we can invent  this fake shit  that gives us this hope  that after you fucking  electronic impulses  stop pulsing in your body,  that there's something else. 
[02:55:30]  If we knew, you know,  if we were in some  walled fucking cage  that was the universe  and we knew everything  about it,  we'd fucking,  you'd shoot yourself  the second you were born.  Why the fuck am I working?  Why am I doing this?  It's hope.  That's what fucking  human beings  are on this world for  is this hope  that something  is going to get better  eventually.  Whether it's in this life  or the next one  that we assume  there's going to be  or we would sit around  and fuck all day  or smoke pot  or do anything.  There's just,  we wouldn't do anything. 
[02:56:00]  It's the key productive.  The biggest thing  that keeps people fighting  is the idea of country  and the idea of religion.  I would say  those are the two  biggest things  that keep people  at each other's throats.  Eventually,  the idea of those things  will go away.  Land, prosperity?  That's part of country to me.  As opposed to being  one big unit.  You know what?  I bet like  even when the world  becomes one,  we'll feel that  South America  or whatever the fuck  they call it  is getting treated  better than us.  There'll always be  a reason. 
[02:56:30]  There's always going to be.  There'll always be  that seventh grade  fucking jealousy thing  in between people.  Yeah, we're not digital.  We're fucking analog.  We can't fucking  just distribute evenly  anything.  There are greedy people.  There are people that...  Yes, there are.  And that I can't see  ever changing.  A whole brand new species  has to fucking come out.  We can't evolve  from what we are.  We need a whole new species  to crawl out of the fucking muck  and go,  you guys are so fucking outdated 
[02:57:00]  like the Neanderthals  and the Cro-Magnon.  We need that to happen.  We need our new age  Neanderthal to come  and treat us like douchebags.  Cro-Magnon fucking  kicked ass on those  big rigid eyebrow  stupid motherfucking  Neanderthals.  Maybe the next form  of fucking evolution  for us then  is with computers.  Is it that crazy  where we are like  where you start to think  of something,  you think of an impulse  and the fucking  phony finger moves?  Maybe that's the next phase  of our evolution  is somehow with computers.  That's not evolution though.  Sure it is. 
[02:57:30]  Some kind of  biotechnical thing  where we integrate  technology  into our physiology.  It's technological evolution.  That's cool.  Or genetic engineering  where that can maybe  advance our evolution somehow.  Walking upright.  Shit like that  is evolution, buddy.  Like I said,  going from a record player  to an iPod  is not evolution.  It's technological evolution.  But now, wait a minute.  Somebody from the 1800s  how well read  they were back then  because they didn't  watch TV  could smoke me  in a fucking conversation  about a lot of stuff.  Dude, you read a letter  from like the Civil War? 
[02:58:00]  My dearest Penelope  as I sit here  amongst the bodies  of my kin  it's like this  elegant fucking letter  and shit  and we can't even  send a letter anymore.  It's all email.  We don't even write.  B-R-B-L-O-L  Semicolon  with a happy face.  Look, did you see?  My dearest Penelope  I shot a rebel today  LOL  I saw a guy  who had a hilarious shirt  that said  you're retarded  and it was spelled  Y-O-U-R  You know, 
[02:58:30]  this is something  you saw on YouTube  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You're retarded  By genetic  I think genetic engineering  is the way  that our own brains  that we are capable  of doing  whatever we're going  to do with  can affect  our evolution.  If we are able  to eradicate  certain diseases  through genetic engineering  grow limbs  just do things  affect our own bodies  through our mind  that's an odd  kind of forced evolution  I think  that's the only way 
[02:59:00]  it could happen  with any speed  I think  but I don't know  if you can eradicate  that natural  hatred we have  for things  that are different.  But look at the way  maybe you can't  eradicate certain instincts  maybe those instincts  or those primal things  take so long  to go away  but look  like Bill said  about 1800s  you're right  but how about  having an argument  with a guy  from 15,000 years ago  that got  be easy  you get beat  he would fucking 
[02:59:30]  blast you in the head  with a rock  you're like  hey we were talking  but look at the differences  in the way we are  in the way we look  at things now  and the way we look  at things then  we already have  a global  what do they say  a global phone thing  which is the internet  we already have now  a completely global  communication network  which we didn't have  except through  separate phone systems  look what's happened  in the last 100 years  I don't see that  as evolution though  yeah three days  without food and water  man you would  we'd be fucking  2001 a space odyssey 
[03:00:00]  looking at a monolith  look at New Orleans  what part of your brain  would  yes of course  we have to survive  I mean we are  creatures that need to eat  and drink  New Orleans  80 year old diabetics  waiting to be rescued  on a bridge  no no  in the superdome  where it became  the thunderdome  you know  that's basic evolution  that's exactly  what you're saying  that also proves  my point  wait is that  Ralphie May  yeah it's Ralphie May  I've been here  for 30 minutes  how are you doing  everybody  I've been enjoying 
[03:00:30]  the conversation  that proves my point  of the disdain  we have for people  that are different  for things that are  different  for different cultures  different ways  there is just  and the people  that are in charge  now  are of a certain  ilk  and will  be more sympathetic  to that ilk  look at how fast  we change  what we feel  about each other  though  how fast  enemies become  people we like  how fast  culture  based purely on economics  do you think we liked  Japan  after World War II  we dropped two bombs 
[03:01:00]  they signed some papers  we shake hands  and it was still  growing up  I remember growing up  going  that's Japanese junk  and oh it's made in Japan  it's a piece of shit  and there was still  this hatred  of Japan  but we needed  to rebuild them  to keep the economy  stable  okay for survival  so the need  to get along  with them  was based  in some kind  of weird survival  it wasn't for our survival  it was to  the economy  is our survival  we'd have gotten along  just great  if they were still  fucking scraping  people  we do like Japan now  it's not like  it was before  we do like Japan now  we do  you're absolutely right 
[03:01:30]  but it was based  on economic reasons  not  we love human beings  self interest  on some level  okay fine  Jim this country  was rich  in enough natural resources  that we didn't have to go  outside this country  at all  at all  we had enough food  we had enough  we have enough factories  we could make everything here  we had everything we needed here  the only reason why  we're fucking with these  other countries  is because a small group  of people at the top  want to get those people  under your thumb  all these  let me ask you one question  to interrupt you  because if it's only  a small group of people 
[03:02:00]  at the top  then how come in one hand  it's all  like we're all animals  who will never get along  so why does it have to be  a small group of the top  controlling us  that is an animal  with too much fucking control  the alpha male  it's the same way  you take the average douchebag  who's a nice guy  you make him a bouncer  you give him a little bit of power  he instantly becomes  a fucking cunt  when did these  when did these things happen  like when did this  this group  that controls it all start  well from what  they didn't keep  Genghis Khan on top  they didn't keep  the Romans on top  from what Bill said  and I haven't read the book 
[03:02:30]  and Bill was talking about  but this old money  this old aristocracy  these old blue bloods  that's been going on  for hundreds of years  these families  now whether they have  taken their power base  and they're using it  a little more clandestine  than they used to  because they used to be  big names  they used to own media  they understand  they understand  that becoming famous  is one of the stupidest things  you can do  if you want any sort of power  so you think the Rockefellers  is still like  have their hands  in as much shit  as they used to  absolutely it's the genius 
[03:03:00]  do you think  they just fell off  then how come the foreigners  own every building  in New York City  instead of the Rockefellers  can I tell you something  do they own it  who owns it  the bank owns it  and those guys  are all paying  fucking interest on it  it all comes back to banks  they fucking own everything  they fucking own  they own all of it  so country means nothing  the fact that China owns  and Japan owns  buildings in New York  it's like  they don't own it  it's this bank  but what makes the banks  they own it  they own it free and clear  well they can rent it out  they can do 
[03:03:30]  no one owns anything  if they want to  go that crazy  if they have the oil  don't they have the things  that kind of make  dude it's not even your money  like think all the money  you've made in your life  how much you've actually  held in your hand  it's a fucking number  on a piece of paper  you put it in a fucking bank  and then through penalties  and taxes  they can basically guide  where the fuck  you're going to put it  that's why I'm in the stock market  I don't know a fucking thing  about it  I just sit in a bar  people  it's a good investment  it's a good investment  I just fucking stick it in there  now I'm trying to pull it out  they're like  yeah go ahead and pull it out  watch how far that dick goes 
[03:04:00]  in your fucking ass  we're going to take it  no matter what  just shut your mouth  and do what we say  that is the vibe  that's not evolution  dude it's an insane  amount of fucking power  that has made major advancements  in the last like  close to 30 years  I don't like to know  who the they are though  I would love to know  who they are  you're never going to know  you're never going to know  and people who sit there  and act like  that's fucking weird  that  like dude  do they know  wait wait  do you know  who runs CBS  do you know  yes Les Moonves 
[03:04:30]  do they know  they're the they  yes and above him  Sumner Redstone  do they know  that they are the they  or is it just  the structure of power  that puts them  in that position  that they don't even know  that they are the they  you know what I mean  I don't know  all I know too  I just read like  I don't know  I read this letter of regret  that Woodrow Wilson wrote  about being the guy  who pushed the Federal Reserve Act  that's from a fucking  standing president  going wow did I just  fuck this country up  it's not like conspiracy theory  and then people be like  well how do you know  he wrote it  how the fuck do you know  he wrote it  and it's just like 
[03:05:00]  you probably can write it  the media would have  put it on  and crucified him  for changing his mind  on something  back in those days  now they have advisors  that would say  don't do that  you're crazy  I just look at what  banks have done  in the amount of criticism  they're getting  versus these douchebag CEOs  who I'm not defending  from the big three  these guys  look at them  they're on fucking TV  you know what they look like  these guys are getting  hung out to dry  never happens with bankers  where are all these  fucking idiots  where are they  weren't the guys  from Lehman Brothers  and Chase 
[03:05:30]  weren't a lot of those guys  fucking called out  and blasted publicly  I mean a lot of these guys  were fucking  they're not going to jail  they need to get raped  I don't get to go with that  you need to go get raped  they just stole  three quarters of a trillion  million  three quarters of a trillion  fucking dollars  from every taxpayer  in this country  they're supposed to  use that money  to help us out  they fucking kept it  they kept it  and they bought  other companies  they bought up  other fucking banks  and nobody's  giving them any shit  nothing's fucking happened  but because  bankers are scumbags  and they are scumbags  and they do control  the money  because they know  the money better 
[03:06:00]  than any of us do  I don't think  that's a sign  that there's just  a couple of  little teeny people  at the top  doing all of it  if human nature  is greedy  and we're always  going to hate each other  well then it's going to  pockets of this  are going to pop up  all over the place  I don't believe  that's what I think  I'll definitely go along  with that  but I also  people who don't  believe in secret societies  or conspiracy theory  I don't understand that  on any fucking level  it's like you can't  any sort of major  this country  came about  through a conspiracy 
[03:06:30]  the revolutionary war  didn't just  spontaneously  everybody's drinking beer  and then you just  started putting  yeah but it isn't  this odd thing  going wow  these people  were being persecuted  and they decided  to rebel  you're crazy  it's not  that wasn't  a crazy idea  of rebelling  against a country  that was oppressing you  you don't just  have a revolution  you have to  get into a room  and start talking  to people  yeah that's conspiring  but that's different  conspiracy  has gotten a different  how do you think  England  see you live here  and it worked good for you 
[03:07:00]  so you look at  that was a revolution  England did not look  at that as a revolution  they looked at  as this is a group  of evil  insurgents  conspiracy  fucking people  Wolverine  it's the same thing  Ralphie Mayette  Gotham Comedy  but no one is saying  thank you  but the fact is  there was a conspiracy  there  and there are  conspiracies  but it seems like  if you mention  a conspiracy theory  like you were saying  with the Patriot Act  it makes it look like  anybody who was for  the government  having certain amounts  of power  with the Patriot Act  are deluded idiots  who are happy  to give up  our civil liberties 
[03:07:30]  and it's like  you don't look at it  like there's any balance  it's like the reality was  I watched  I watched what happened  on 9-11  we all watched  so what's the solution  to it  like don't let the government  listening to my phone calls  no no no  but no one's saying that  but what is the  okay so say  don't listen to your phone calls  what do you do  when you have a potential  for a dirty bomb  or the potential  with suitcase news  let me give you  let me  dude  do you think  that they weren't  doing it anyways  you think that they weren't  no I don't  because I think  the bottom line  is you're giving them  too much credit  I don't think  the FBI  and the CIA  were passing information 
[03:08:00]  I really don't  I think that these  dumb motherfuckers  were so proprietarial  with their territory  and they're getting credit  that they're like  every other human nature thing  they were thinking selfishly  they weren't communicating  I can't wrap my head  around the fact  that someone who works  in the Pentagon  is as fucking stupid  and as lazy as I am  it's frightening to think that  Bill but it's the truth  with every job I've gotten  I've been amazed  what are you basing that on  you've never been to the Pentagon  you know  you haven't worked with  oh my god  that guy down in the Air Force  but human beings  are human beings 
[03:08:30]  any job I've ever had  growing up  they're not  the people  they're all the same  you haven't looked at McDonald's  and you look at somebody  and you're like  you know what dude  you fucking deserve to work here  because you're unmotivated  stupid  you're a fucking idiot  the guys at the top  of radio companies  are just as dumb  as the guy  that was running  a fucking blacktop business  that I was toiling  my ass over growing up  absolutely  and you think  it's going to be different  but you get there  and you go  oh my god  this is the same asshole  there's no morons  we're all morons  we're all fucking morons 
[03:09:00]  you're right  you never meet anybody  and just be like  wow this guy is a fucking  there's a couple  smarter people  but they're not that  detached from humanity  right  like right here  like you said  cut the food off  and that smart guy  he'll probably win  because he's a little  smarter at making some shit  but I'll tell you one thing  he'll be just as animalistic  to keep himself alive  I quit  you guys  no no no  I'm not  I'll give you shit  I'm just thinking  more listeners  do they really want to  listen to this fucking  the phones are fucking packed  they probably  when you look at like  when I hear like  9-11 conspiracies  like you know 
[03:09:30]  the military was told  to stand down  like let's break that down  what guys  I know a lot of military guys  what military guys  look  there's some hijacked planes  being flown into the buildings  don't get up  don't fly your planes up  okay sir  you couldn't keep  Abu Ghraib a secret  in this fucking day and age  with the internet  and with stuff  with information  Jim I'm not talking about  I'm not talking about  9-11  I'm only using that  as an example  I'm just using that  as a conspiracy example 
[03:10:00]  of the way people think  that the they  can be so completely  detached from the humanity  that we deal with  I don't see that  I hope I'm wrong  about all this shit  you're probably not  totally wrong  I just went to the wrong  fucking YouTube  fucking video  I really hope to  you think I want to be  right about this shit  dude  I have panic attacks  watching this shit  I have to literally  stop watching this shit  I'd love some anarchy  don't watch the news  dude give me some  fucking anarchy  please  I'd love it  I'd love it 
[03:10:30]  crush the whole  fucking financial industry  good  come crumbling down  so where there's  lines of Americans  looking to Canada  for soup  and you don't feel like  you're going to be  in that line  fuck no  fuck no  I would absolutely not  he's got new hair  I got new hair  fuck him  you know how to farm  can you grow soup  for whatever the fuck  you do with it  I've survived  I've survived  in shit  40 acres of soup  I've hunted for myself 
[03:11:00]  I've skinned  and cooked animals  I've fucking  gotten my own water  I've lived in the  Mojave Desert  not for years  but for a long time  for a long weekend  for an extra long  vacation weekend  but it's just one of  those things where  I learned survival  but he's right though  this is the type of shit  that me dude  I'm fucking useless  I don't need Walmart  I don't need fucking  to go and buy some shit  at the store  or else I'm not going to be able  I'm starving  what do I do  I'm not some fucking  piece of shit 
[03:11:30]  housewife  or jerk off guy  so where are you going to go  hunting on Long Island  thank you  what's your first move  if there's anarchy  now you have to leave  the studio  where are you going to go  first move is to get  the fuck away  from the multitudes  of people  that would be it  you'd have to go to places  where they can't survive  he's going to get in the left lane on the highway  because that's not going to be crowded  it all sounds well and good  but where are you finding food  on Long Island  fuck Long Island  don't go near a city  but you don't have your car 
[03:12:00]  everything stops  like at 11 o'clock  you don't think you can grab a fucking bike  and fucking just get the fuck away from people  so you would hit the mountains  63 years old  you're on a bike  I would go somewhere where there's no  fuck the 63 year old  he's fucked  I'm saying you  me  if I'm 63  I'm sitting in my window  with a shotgun shooting people then  what do you want from me  alright  let's play this out  the ultimate prey  you jump in your car  and you head  where  mountains  where are you staying warm  wherever 
[03:12:30]  you'd have to be  on the fly  you'd have to see  where the people are going  where they're not going  where you can hunt  how you get to go off Long Island  if everyone else knows that  fuck I gotta get out of here  fuck it  grab a boat  get the fuck out of here  what if other people  grab a boat  other people  not everyone is  you know why  because everyone's weak and stupid  and waiting for someone to help them  people don't help themselves  like those fucking douchebags  in New Orleans  fuck them all  help yourself  help your fucking self  get the fuck out of there  you waited and died 
[03:13:00]  and sat in your own shit  waiting to be helped  fuck you  help your fucking self  they're weak  they're motherfucking weak people  that's why  they had no money  fuck them in their money  walk over a fucking bridge  and get the fuck out of town  get out of God  fuck them  no this is what happens  it was literally like  you know every time we're up here  every time it's gonna snow  they tell you  this is the big one man  there's gonna be 20  this happens to them  anytime there's a fucking hurricane  the sheep all went to the fucking slaughterhouse 
[03:13:30]  is what happened  this is the time  fuck them  this is the time it actually happened  yeah and when you have fucking people with guns  on the other side of the bridge  not letting you go across  they weren't  huh  there weren't people with guns  on the other side of the bridge  not letting them go across  what national guard people  no  no  civilians  and they would block off whole neighborhoods  with militia  then grab your own fucking guns  and shoot them  it's called fucking survival  anarchy  it's called anarchy  it's called murder  if someone's keeping you from surviving  with a weapon  but he is making a point 
[03:14:00]  you then  have to fucking survive  that's why I'm talking  that's exactly what I'm talking about  when there's a breakdown  of society  but it's white people versus black people  you're gonna say  Anthony doesn't believe  Anthony  that's what it was  no  fuck that  no  I'm not talking race  that's the truth  you can say fuck it all you want to  fuck it  I'm not talking race  okay  so you're telling me  the black people  so what you're saying  what you're saying  is black people  were too stupid to leave  no you're saying that  you're saying race motherfucker  no  you're saying race  listen  I'm saying that they were too poor 
[03:14:30]  I know  they were too poor  to get transportation to leave  on off chance  if it costs $500  to go visit relatives in  and why does it cost $500  to get your ass  from point A to point B  if you don't have a car  how are you gonna get there  leave  fucking leave  how  you don't have a car  how  you just start warning  improvise  and fucking leave  how do you all run a hurricane  that's 150 miles wide  leave  leave  how  you don't see the fucking  weather map  that it's coming  walk the fuck out  150 miles  in three days  or two days 
[03:15:00]  150 miles  the hurricane didn't go  150 miles inland  it did not go  150 miles inland  without that much wind  it was in fucking New Orleans  those people stayed there  waiting for help  help me  help me  help me  fuck you  I'm helping myself  where do you go  where do you go  do you think that thing  went 150 miles inland  with wind speeds  of 150 miles an hour  the second it hit  New Orleans  it started getting weak  of course it did  you think 200 miles inland  it was the same damage  as New Orleans  bullshit 
[03:15:30]  look at Monroe  bullshit  bullshit  bullshit  it was  hurricane strange winds  were up to  150 miles inland  no fucking way  let me ask you a question  you think New Orleans  is on the Gulf  it's not on the Gulf  that disaster  where all the people died  was right on the fucking coast  and right up the river  it had nothing to do  with anything inland  I'm going to ask you a question  I'm going to ask you a question  Bill Burr  we give the mic to Bill Burr  if you're broke  you're living in New Orleans  they're always telling you  the big one's coming 
[03:16:00]  you have nowhere to go  you don't have any fucking money  right  nine zero  you're going to roll the dice  ah this is probably bullshit again  I lose my house  but even if you go to leave dude  if you don't  if you got three bucks  in your pocket  where the fuck are you going to go  oh hell  now I agree with Bill  then why  then it's your fucking problem  that you have three bucks  in your fucking pocket  and you know the thing  about Anthony right now  is a lot of people  probably listening  thinking that he's sounding  like this insensitive  fucking person  but what he's doing  is he has the mindset  that you do need to survive 
[03:16:30]  where you put it on yourself  a lot of those people  the problem was  they had belief  that the system  was going to help them  and oh like insurance companies  where's my water  we're fucking dying over here  because we have no water  there's water everywhere  pick up a fucking pot  that washed up somewhere  fucking build a fire  put the water over it  and drink it after it's boiled  and you're fucking fine  but those fucking cunts  sat there waiting  for pallets of drinking water  it's got oil  fuck you  you can purify fucking water 
[03:17:00]  if you have a purification process  with fire and gauze  with fire and fucking gauze  and a bed sheet  a fucking bed sheet in a pot  and you're drinking  fucking clean water  bullshit  they waited there  you can't take the oil out  they waited there  like they're sheep  in this country  yes you can  no the molecules  are too simple  bullshit  look it up  what are you talking about  you're going to take  some sewer water  from fucking New York sewer water  you can shit in water  and I'll fucking purify it  let's do it right now  I will say this  one thing I will say 
[03:17:30]  crossroads of the world  you do to a certain degree  like even though  there were people  that could have left New Orleans  and could have left  I do agree with that  but it's also like  you don't expect certain things  which maybe in hindsight  is ignorant  but it's like  when you go to the Superdome  for a football game  you honestly don't expect  to see like  everyone you live with  in the city there  and people dying  on the 50 yard line  it's just like  maybe it's naive  but you just  you don't expect certain things  so they  and the government  did fuck up 
[03:18:00]  they didn't  FEMA was terrible  and Megan was terrible  just like the government  fucks up  they fucked up  but you know who fucked up  the people that didn't  take care of themselves  are you going to sit there  and die  you're just going to  fucking die  and go  oh well  the government fucked up  so I'm going to die  or use every fucking  instinct  every will you have  to live  to do something  to get yourself  out of the fucked  situation you're in  what if you're fucking 80  and you already can't walk  fuck you  then you're dead 
[03:18:30]  I'm sorry  but that's not  it happens  those people aren't going to  fucking live through  some kind of downfall  of society  through some kind of  breakdown of this country  they're not  they're not fucking living  but in fairness  they're dead  I actually understand  the babies and old people  dead  they do take care of the  dead  they do take care of the  fires in California  a little bit differently  the way they rush aid  to a lot of other places  a little bit differently  and they rush aid  to other places  differently than they did  at the end  they fucked up  they didn't do it right  it just sounded like  De Niro in the untouchable  I want them dead  I want them dead 
[03:19:00]  dead  dead  they take care of fires  in California differently  meaning that  the urgency of their response  for rich people  and the being coordinated  with their response  their houses burn down too  of course they do  if they're insured  they get paid for  it was embarrassing  the way they handled  the world  it really was  I'm not saying  the government didn't fuck up  I'm just saying  you can't wait  for someone to help you  in a life and death situation  he's right  I think he's right  the fuck are you waiting around for  sitting there starving 
[03:19:30]  and not having water  when there's water everywhere  if you have any inkling  of survival skills  you can purify fucking water  with household items  can you teach me how to  start a fire without a match  that was one of my  new year's resolutions  I tried doing that once  in the rain  I was freezing cold all night  I can't fucking start a fire  I can't start a good fire  in my fireplace  you got stuck in the woods  and you didn't do too well  I fucking lived  a few years ago  you got stuck in the woods  you weren't eating  you weren't keeping yourself warm  let me tell you something  you did get some drinking water  I remember  I was lost in the woods 
[03:20:00]  he's a fucking armchair survivalist  that's what I'm thinking  we found shelter  he just bought all this shit  he's a smart ass  go fuck yourself  we fucking found shelter  in the woods  he can't even start a fire  without a fucking match  he's yelling  we found shelter in the fucking woods  did you eat  found water  did you eat  no  only a day had gone by  what if two or three days  were going to go by  then I would have had to  figure out somehow  what are we going to do  what are we going to do  you got the water 
[03:20:30]  I know how to make a fucking snare  I'd snare a rabbit  what if it was  25 degrees cold  say it was like minus 5  I wouldn't have been out there  in the first place  but let's say you were  you thought you knew where the car was  let's say you didn't  no I would never have fucking gone out  he's Joe the plumber  that's right  oh Jesus Christ  I'm Joe the survivalist  hey wait but Ralph  you said you knew how to start  a fire  how do you do it  there's a lot of ways  you can  Zippo  no you can use  friction  you can flint and steel 
[03:21:00]  you can take  hey if I come down to Gotham  after my show's at Caroline  there you go  there's a nice  I like that  can you show me the greener  Ralphie you do realize  if there's anarchy  you're fucked right  no actually  I think I'm a survivor  everyone  everyone thinks they are  everyone thinks they are  you would be  in a week  in three days  we'd put you on a spit  in two seconds  in a week without food  you would be weak  Ralphie would put an apple 
[03:21:30]  in your mouth  within the first fucking  20 minutes  he'd be in a big  steel pot  I am genetically superior  to you all  in the event of chaos  in the event of chaos  I am the only survivor  in this whole room  Ralphie would so be  the first to go  you so skinny bastards  would be weak  fucking Bill Burr  said he  what a hell of a marble  what a hell of a marble  steak he'd make  first of all  I am genetically  the only one  who would survive  and if this was 
[03:22:00]  a hundred years ago  I'd probably be  the only one here  alive  we would just  slice pieces off  you  oh god damn  wet on my titties  he'd be  a big piece of shawarma  that's funny  I like  you would so be  the first to go  I love shawarma  I think y'all are  completely wrong  I'd be the only one  to survive  we would be picking  our teeth  with your bones  no but the fact  that Ralphie  you know  I used to make fun  of the Boy Scouts  I thought they were gay  their little uniforms 
[03:22:30]  and shit  the Boy Scouts  and the Weevalos  and all that crap  they suck  yeah  I thought my older brother  he became a Cub Scout  and got the  fucking  not even the shit  kicked out of him  just the vibe  was there  at the bus stop  like he just  immediately became  that little baby fawn  that walked away  from the herd  and I was just like  I'm not doing that shit  who knew  so anyway  we got two  hockey players  calling each other  oh shit  is that where  they started this  wow  that was an hour  and a half ago  Jesus Christ  Ralphie  where are you gonna be  Gotham  I'm at Gotham Comedy Club 
[03:23:00]  yeah  alright and Bill's  at Caroline's  and Jimmy's  gonna be in DC  I'll be performing  there's a new club  it's on a colonized moon  yeah  I'll be performing  we can  Lunar Funny Bone  ladies and gentlemen  bring your singular  money denomination  to pay for his book  we can save a lot of time  Bill was talking about  like the next hundred years  you were talking about  thousands of years  in the future  that's where the  that's where the problem arose  where there were two different things  that were  I'm talking about next week  they weren't to me  completely separate arguments  they weren't 
[03:23:30]  even though  mine was  he can't really technically prove his  although his is much more tangible  oh boy  I was going for a summary  and I fucked up  I am  I am  I'm saying  you stirred the shit up  you stirred up  do it like the end of the political debates  I was going for some acknowledgements  not another chapter  no I'm saying  closing statements  closing statements  Senator  Bill's is more tangible  because it's something we can kind of see and touch  and mine is more like  well this is what I think  you know  I understand that  you're more Dr. Kaku  and I think we actually  I believe that  I think we hate less 
[03:24:00]  I really do  evolution through  if you read about old New York  where like the neighborhood  the Irish  you don't  you don't see that kind of hate  as much anymore  it's political correctness  but you don't really see it  like the neighborhoods  you beat the shit out of each other  it's laws  it's lack of corruption  that used to be there  no no no  because back in the day  some of them  they were Italian  they were 100% Italian  you were 100% Irish  right right  so again  yeah it's kind of  everybody mixed together  it's getting a little more confusing 
[03:24:30]  Puerto Rican  I mean I do a lot of  I like History of New York City  and man they would  one block would fight  the next block  because it was the Italians  and the Irish  and the Polacks  and this and that  how brutal were those fights  holy shit  oh my god  you watch that movie right  with the five points  where they're down there  which one is that  New York  Gangs of New York  oh right right right  they just go with hatchets  like the butcher  the butcher would just come out  with his hatchet  that he used at his butcher shop  and just start hacking apart  some carpenter 
[03:25:00]  that's at you with a hammer  it's bad enough  if that happens to you  then just  where medicine was at that point  yeah  they didn't know how to do shit  medicine was basically  let's stick something  that he can bite down on  in his teeth  as we remove this appendage  as we hacksaw this off  this problem  yeah  you know  keep your note to yourself  we'll be right back  I know  wait  no  sitting there  I can roll  Opie and Anthony  Bill Burr  Ralphie May 
[03:25:30]  Jim Norton  and guys on the ice  calling each other a faggot  that's where we began  are you still talking about  your hair restoration  you fake survivalist  he was talking about  hey  I want to see you do  one stupid thing  let's stick Anthony  in the woods for a weekend  start a fire  fucking drink some  shit water  because you know it's safe  after what you do to it  you know something  have himself film himself  like the Blair Witch  you know how important it is  how important it is 
[03:26:00]  to be able to get water  water is the fucking thing  not all  let's tie him up  and throw him in the Pine Barrens  let's see if he can survive  can he survive an hour  above 110th Street  no that's a whole different  that's a whole different story  I'd need a few items  from home  racism's fun  Jesus  so are you going to do  something for us  show us something  you talk a good game  yeah  filter some water  I'd have to leave  you know  and go in search  of a few things  I bet he can't even  pitch a tent 
[03:26:30]  no shit  sure he can  just show him somebody  at the age of 15  yeah well  there are a couple of ways  of getting water  from your surroundings  I don't want to listen anymore  I want to see  yeah  we want to see  enough talk  we want action  we want action  because I forgot  that you went on  a little hiking trip  you got lost in the woods  you weren't even that far  from your car  I was too  you got lost in the woods  we went on a hiking trip  me and my chick  wow  who did it  yes 
[03:27:00]  that's what  and she said  she said  oh we go down this way  and I said no  we came up this way  and she goes no  this is another trail  you listen too  why are we listening to her  he's blaming the crowd  yeah yeah  he's blaming the crowd  maybe that's what happened  to those guys in New Orleans  listen to the woman  no no  it'll pass  it'll pass  we don't need to go anywhere  we weren't  he should  I didn't  I didn't  because we weren't  in any shit yet  when the shit started  I knew how to fucking  take care of things  I knew how to take care of shit 
[03:27:30]  once the shit started  as long as Anthony's in the woods  and he's with someone  who knows where they're going  she didn't know where she was going  why did you listen to her  because she said she knew  where she was going  he kind of got you there  a little bit  and you got lost  and you fucking deserved it  you're right  I did  I did deserve it  because you're a bald  but  I did deserve it  but  I found shelter 
[03:28:00]  I found water  I was able to  get us out of the woods  by walking  and keeping  the same direction  knowing that  I'm not in the middle  of fucking  nowhere nowhere  that we're going to  pop out somewhere  you sound like you're going to  get fired on the apprentice  right now  yeah yeah  uh  sir  I  you know after you fuck up  and then you're like  you know but I  took the proper state  so  so every guy that listened  to his chick at one point  is going to die  in a fucking cataclysm  a cataclysm  fuck you  because then we're all dead  Joe the survivalist 
[03:28:30]  if it was  if it was some kind of  fucking big ordeal  I would tell her  to shut the fuck up  no we're doing it this way  but for a little hike  for the day  I'll go alright  cutie pie  we'll take your trail  you and those white people  who get lost in the woods  why are they  funny and laughing at me  it was a big ordeal  it was a big ordeal  because you were stuck  overnight  that's when it becomes  a big ordeal  you almost died  if the sun's going down  it's still not a big ordeal  he went to take a leak  at a rest area  he got lost  fake survivalist 
[03:29:00]  I survived  I survived  but show us something  I found shelter  Anthony plays with  battleships in his  skills  share with him  it's like asking  don't do some water  it's like asking a boxer  here show me how you  knock someone out  with someone here  in the room  and have him do it  yes it is  because under  shut up  because under  under those  you need the circumstances  where you have to  fucking life or death  to be able 
[03:29:30]  to fucking come up  with this shit  I say enough talk  I want to see some action  that's what I'm  yeah  that's beautiful  that's it  you're a good talker  we want to see some  tomorrow  I want to see who's better  I want to see who fights better  tomorrow  you or Danny  I want to see who fights better  go at it  no play fighting  I mean real  I say Danny  like you fucking hate each other  you're not going to do it  because it's not necessary  because it's not necessary  Anthony do you go camping  in your backyard  no I don't go camping  in my backyard  I can't wait  to fucking be walking  over your bodies  I cannot wait 
[03:30:00]  to be walking  over your weak  dead fucking bodies  you gotta jump out  like your bathroom  in slippers  you're fucking  you're dead  no with my 5'11 boots  motherfucker  you'd all be dead  with your stupid  trendy sneakers  go fuck off  you should have  you should have kept Jill around  because at least she knows  how to start a fire  yeah  with the new girl's clothes  shit  give me a break  if you want to hear  hockey guys yelling faggot 
[03:30:30]  or what  or you want to say that  for tomorrow  there's plenty of ways  to purify fucking water  that's right  to give their plastic bottles  throw white people  with blonde hair  and blue eyes into it  right  Ralphie nailed you  no he didn't  I got you a little bit  I got you a little bit  you came so far  from fucking nailing me  there was nothing  you've done some good  fat jokes  but I got you a little bit

[03:32:30]  bill and his point  about the alpha male  dude this is hysterical audio  you fucking pussy  I like how they ran out of insults  you fucking pussy  and kept going back to it  my favorite part of that  is when he's reaching  to call for some kind of thing  to fling at the other guy  and he calls him a tit fucker  like that would be like  the worst thing in the world 
[03:33:00]  you put your penis  on girls tits  I thought he said  tit fucker  oh yeah  I didn't hear that  that's great  oh fantastic  Matt in Ohio  just saying  he says  I bet if Bear Grylls  was there  he would be able  to show everyone  some sort of survival trick  so why can't he get  to the nearest hotel  yeah really  fuck him too  don't give me that shit  you had him on the show  we could have told him  that to his face  we did too  I asked him about the hotels  no not this time  but we did take care of it  the last time I guess  you're right 
[03:33:30]  do you go hunting Ant  I used to go hunting  I just I don't really enjoy  I do a lot of target shooting  I don't like killing  he got sad when he saw  the animal  yeah I kind of like  killing things  okay  I want to learn how to do it  I'm not a hunter  I like shooting  but I'm not a hunter  what's your favorite weapon  I have quite a few of them  pistol or the rifle  I enjoy the AR-15  really?  yes  just got a fun gun to shoot  that gun sucks  I have a Sig 5  oh wait a minute  wow

[03:35:00]  is my night table gun  it's got a laser sight on it  that's a half  coming in  that's a good one  Terminator  that's a great weapon  I have three versions  of what they would call  an AR-15  one is the one  that's used by the  DEA and Secret Service  which is a very  lightweight one  made by  god  I can't remember  the name of the  see I lose points  because I can't remember  the name  I own so many  goddamn guns  then I have my  middle version  which is just  your basic AR-15  minus 8 for  commenting on bombing 
[03:35:30]  there  then I have my  heavy version  with a bipod  an ACOG scope  and it takes  the 5.56 round  nice  that hurts your shoulder  no it's very nice  it's very stable  not a lot of talk  from the Ralphie camp  well I'm letting him  stay in his case  it's very nice  it's a nice rifle  how many guns  do you have Ralphie?  I have  I want to say  nine  a lot of hunting rifles  I guess  a bolt action  I have a 
[03:36:00]  Weatherby Vanguard  30 out of 6  you're talking  hunting rifle  okay yeah  that's an amazing  rifle  I have a  270  a Remington  270  that's awesome  what is that  bolt action  no that one's  a semi-auto  it's a step up  from the 260  by 10  I have  three  combat  shotguns  because I got  one in each house  and I doubled up  on one  I'm sorry  shotguns are nice  aren't they fun  yeah they really are  it's a  little condescending 
[03:36:30]  Mossberg  two points  you kind of called  your gun cute  there Ralph  I'm assuming  you don't own  any pistols  I do have pistols  oh you do  I have  Taurus 9mm  6-hour  .45  and I  I'm thinking  about a  .40 Glock  because I like  the different  specs of it  you know  oh I just  recently also  picked up a  .50 caliber  Desert Eagle  which  nice weapon  I have  but see  there you go  I have a  Smith & Wesson  snub nose  .357 that I  love to death 
[03:37:00]  with Walnut  I think  it wins  an old  wheel gun  yeah  those are fun  those are nice  you never know  I got that  I'm building  a GTO  and we're putting  guns in it  yeah we're putting  where the headlights go  do you know  one of those  have you seen  the hand safe  that you do  the combination  oh yeah  yeah  put a little drop  in that motherfucker  I'm putting it  in the door  hey why don't you  guys have a duel  damn  yeah come on  stand back to back  a duel  just take  you know  take out  what's your 
[03:37:30]  state of residence  California  Tennessee  Tennessee  okay  you don't have a carry  they fucking hunt each other  I do  oh so why do you need  some for your fucking car  or do you just fucking carry  because I don't want it  I don't want it  on me at all times  why not  I just don't  Anthony  why not  because I'm a liability  I'm fat as hell  and I'm afraid  somebody would take it  from me  but that's where  you need it  on the places  you least expect  so you know  scale  time scale  Jesus  sorry  just be scaled 
[03:38:00]  with bullet holes  oh boy  another bad joke  Jesus Christ  why not make one joke  hey I don't mind  yes uh  Billy  why don't we drop  both you guys  on the Appalachian Trail  yeah  and uh  there's some sort of goal  you gotta reach  and you're allowed  to hunt each other  you gotta pitch this  to fucking uh  it would be a great  reality show  a reality show  it would be  it would be great  I  I  and when he would be  I can survive  yeah  it should be real survival  Ralphie  no bones wants to know  if you have a potato gun 
[03:38:30]  no I don't have  a potato gun  see that would be  another fat joke  why what's  potato  potatoes are really fat  I mean that doesn't  if you eat enough  I'm sure  is the potato gun  a real thing  or is that bullshit  yes it's real  you've never seen  a potato gun  you take a big tube  sometimes pvc  oh no I get it  now I get it  I'm a foreigner  sorry potato gun  that pumps air  into the back of it  that  and um  and a valve  release for the air  that you pump  into the chamber  and then you take  the potato  and you go  thwock  on the front 
[03:39:00]  of this thing  and it'll actually  cut the potato  in the shape  of the barrel  cause you know  you're like  cookie cutter  so it makes  a very tight seal  and then when you  thwock  release the air  it shoots the potato  out at great  velocity  and it goes  a great distance  they gotta have  youtube videos  oh yeah  I think everybody  missed the fact  that Billy actually  thought that you  could make a gun  out of a potato  oh potato gun  he's like  is that a real thing  he's Irish  he wants to make 
[03:39:30]  everything  out of a potato  like mr potato  and only with a gun  you pop a grip  and a barrel  and it'll freeze  motherfucker  I think I got  it confused  with like bongs  how you can  make a bong  out of a nail  I think you  can do that  you know like  those zip guns  you take a little  tube  and if you  shave a gun  down nice and  thin you can  enjoy it with  a burger  what if you  carve it in the  shape of a gun  well you can do  that with a bar  of soap and  escape from  prison like  Dillinger did  or Woody Allen 
[03:40:00]  and take the money  and run  until it rains  Coke Logic has  been keeping  track of all the  guns you mentioned  and Coke Logic  asks does aunt  own a Ralphie  gun to hunt  Ralphies  no I don't  AR-15  AR-15  AR-15  I was having  FS-2000  which is the  semi-automatic  version of the  F-2000  which is  comes from the  P  you ever see  the  what is that  the P-90s  that are in  Call of Duty

[03:41:30]  I don't care  I don't care  but when you say  I don't care  it means you care  that's one of the  rules on our show  every gun  I didn't know  that rule  I've been  what  what  been  yeah but at some  point you really  need a recommendation  okay he's been  arrested for shooting  a potato gun  let's go to Alan  Alan the trucker  Alan what are you  hauling today  right now I'm empty  yeah  oh  he's a bareback  or whatever they call it  I want to call out  Ralphie there

[03:49:00]  or a dead woman  when it all comes  no I'm just saying  that's the type of person  that is gonna be gone  Step Brothers  now available on DVD  Blu-ray  high def  and PSP  Step Brothers  stars Will Ferrell  and John C. Reilly  rated R for crude  and sexual content  and pervasive language  available in both  theatrical and  unrated versions  what  I heard that's funny  I don't know  I wasn't saying  maybe they could give us  a free fucking copy

[03:50:00]  no Joe  Joe Perry  Joe Perry  Joe Perry  Joe Tyler  yeah Joe Perry  yeah you got a write up  I can't remember  where it was  Joe Perry  oh my god  oh okay  this is Jim  I just picked up  the name of Steve Perry  he knows nothing  no we had Joe Perry in  we better be there  nice guy but a bore  yes yes  well you know  we finally got a good guest  and you're gonna  you're gonna trash him  oh wait  you haven't talked to him yet  no we did  oh okay  so that's alright  no he was great  he was in a conspiracy theory  it went great  was he really  was he good really  yeah  I do think that Oswald 
[03:50:30]  acted alone though  hmm  he never did  huh  he never did before  hmm  I don't know on that one  the jury's still out  I'm starting to think  he acted alone  I don't know  so many weird  weird things with that  could you pull that off  with that  with that  bolt action  bolt action  guinea rifle that he had  probably not  that's tough  no way  it's been done a number  a number of times though  in uh  since then  bolt actions are so hard  to fucking bolt quickly  and then take aim again 
[03:51:00]  you got the recoil  and then you got  that's a hard shot  you got wind  you got velocity  altitude change  that's a very hard shot  if you were a hunting man  for sport  and you didn't want  to spoil the meat  where would you shoot him  um  you still have to avoid  the entails  my first  buck that I shot  was running away from me  and I shot him between  his asshole and his balls  and uh  Jesus Christ  and it shredded his  uh insides  all the blood came out  it was the greatest deer  that I've ever tasted 
[03:51:30]  I don't think he was running away from me  really  it was um  yeah  cause all the blood had come out  and none of the meat  I heard if you shoot him  in the entrails  like all the shit  and everything comes out  you don't want that  I think  he just got him quick  I'm not a hunter  but from what I know  you shoot targets  and then you go back  to your air conditioning house  I think a neck shot  is a good shot  I've had him with Anthony  and his survival skills  right behind the shoulder  yeah yeah  right behind the shoulder  somewhere in there  I think it's a good shot  shoot the antlers  it knocks them down  I shot them  he really has sets of fell  he has sets of lures 
[03:52:00]  it knocks off their equilibrium  and they tumble  they get no reception  is that what you did  right there  is that it  that's the other place though  we said that yesterday  I didn't go there  that's the other place  what was that in your clinic  that you went to  went to medical hair restoration  oh really  yeah  they ripped it right out  the back of my head  put it on top  look at that brother  they just took some Brillo  and fucking duct tape  now he's kid from kid and play  yeah  it seems like the brothers  they can only get that  fucking flat top  he was Cleveland  and from the family guy  now he's  that was  and these guys are all
