<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting his awkward experience at Mark Golan's party for *Details* Magazine. He described the star-studded guest list, including Kenneth Paltrow, George Whipple, Lisa Ling, Michael Buffer, and surprisingly, Gary Coleman, who was the subject of mockery by some hip-hop artists present. Opie relentlessly ribbed Anthony for attending, implying a sellout.  The conversation focused on Anthony's solo attendance, contrary to the original plan to attend with Opie and Ben as a satirical commentary.  The hosts and callers extensively joked about Anthony's apparent social shift.  The segment transitioned to a discussion of a Bellevue Hospital documentary shown on HBO, featuring humorous and often offensive commentary about the patients' behavior.

The show then moved into a series of loosely connected segments.  The hosts began by discussing a news story about a man who masturbated for six hours in front of his computer, followed by further discussion and vulgar commentary on the HBO Bellevue Hospital documentary, including call-in segments with listeners sharing their reactions. This was followed by an extended bit where Anthony impersonated Ronald Reagan on the phone while Opie pretended not to recognize him, leading to a humorous exchange filled with crude jokes.  A conversation with "Spaz" about his experiences in a gay play followed, detailing uncomfortable and sexually suggestive improvisations and unwanted touching by a fellow actor.  This segment ended with a guest playing a song with crude and sexually suggestive lyrics about menstruation.

The next segment focused on Rick's upcoming marriage.  The hosts and callers engaged in a series of sexually explicit and offensive conversations about marriage, infidelity, and racial stereotypes.  They teased the release of a tape of Rick's past television appearance where he made controversial statements about his family and views on fidelity.  Numerous callers shared negative marriage experiences using vulgar language and graphic descriptions, often including misogynistic and homophobic comments.  Rick's bachelor party was recounted, detailing lap dances and other sexually suggestive events.  A guest, Mark, described the bachelor party, including an anecdote about "Drunk German Ed," a man with a bullet hole in his head who was ejected from various locations due to intoxication. A failed attempt to conduct a contest, "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money," involving a woman the hosts deemed undesirable, concluded the segment with more sexually explicit and offensive banter and calls.  Advertisements for "Bikini Softball 2" and the "Razor Rollerboard Scooter" aired throughout.

The show concluded with an anecdote about a tough Long Islander followed by a commercial for the Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  This led to an extended, chaotic bit involving a caller named Brewer, who recounted increasingly absurd events involving his dog and the scooter.  Brewer's increasingly expletive-laden description of the dog riding the scooter and the resulting chaos prompted the hosts to yell at him and threaten to call the police.  The segment ended abruptly with a call from a disoriented man named Bill, who delivered increasingly incoherent and bizarre claims about being in Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean ride and then on the planet Jupiter, leaving the hosts reacting with a mix of amusement and concern.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm a red part, the O.P. and Anthony show, that thing's hilarious. 
[00:00:30]  Ant was hanging out with the beautiful people last night.  Boy, was I out of place.  What the hell are you hanging out with the beautiful people?  You see it in the paper all the time, these big to-do parties.  Parties, sure, sure.  You see all the celebrities.  Why didn't the paparazzi get a picture of you?  I think they got a picture of Madonna.  You were at the same party as Madonna last night, dude.  I'm moving and shaking, dude.  Yeah, where's the article?  This isn't the Anthony I know.  Well, first of all, I was stood up by Rick and Ben. 
[00:01:00]  We were supposed to go to the party, right?  We were all going to go and just goof on everybody.  It was a party for Mark Golan, Details Magazine.  His first issue under his leadership.  So funny.  I mean, the pomp and circumstance, the whole big laser light show outside the place.  Lights, the music.  Were you hanging with Puff Daddy?  Oh.  Was Puff Daddy there, Anthony? 
[00:01:30]  You and the beautiful people?  Well, the beautiful people got to go right in.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  My cars are pulling up.  And there's a guy there with a headset and everything.  And he's undoing the velvet rope and letting people in.  I'm like, oh, this must be the line for the people that know Mark Golan.  That's me.  And then he starts.  This isn't the line, people.  Guestless line is around here.  A big line of schlubs.  So I get on that line.  The only consolation was on the same line as me. 
[00:02:00]  Was a member of the movie Clerks?  Yeah, of course.  The guy that was in that J?  Smoking weed.  Smoking weed.  Drinking beer.  Doing coke.  He was on that line and so was the other guy from Clerks.  I'm not even supposed to be here.  That guy?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, they were on the same schlub line I was on.  So then, you know, get inside.  What, what, what, what, Rick?  What?  You look puzzled.  Yeah.  What were you doing waiting on a line, dude?  I had a set up for you to walk right in.  No, that's the line to walk right in.  There was a line to walk right in. 
[00:02:30]  The short line?  Were you on the short line or the long line?  No, there was one line and then there was the guy at the velvet rope letting the people  in from the limos.  All right, well, you were supposed to go up and tell them, ask for the name I gave you  and you would have been walked right in.  You should have been waiting on a line.  You know what's worse than waiting on a line?  Walking up to the guy, telling him how you're supposed to get right in and having him  send you to the line.  That looks real embarrassing.  How embarrassing.  I don't do that.  So you know what?  I stood on the line.  Who cares?  I don't care. 
[00:03:00]  So did you get into the party?  How long did you have to wait outside?  Not long.  It was like five minutes.  It wasn't long.  Did you get your picture with Madonna?  No, there were people there, you know.  Kenneth Paltrow was there, Anthony.  I saw that guy from the gossip show on E! with the caterpillar over his eyebrows.  Oh, the guy who looks like Martin Scorsese?  George Whipple, I guess his name is.  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.  Yeah, the big guy.  And he was there with his camera crew and stuff.  And then, you know, I see Mark Golan say, hi, nice party, where's the bar? 
[00:03:30]  And of course, he knew right away.  So they're mixing some pretty strong drinks there, too, Opie.  I got to tell you.  Had a couple of absolutes and orange juice.  Sure.  Loosen up so I could mingle with the beautiful people.  Yeah.  You're changing, man.  Come on, shut up.  Why are you hanging with these people?  I was supposed to meet Rick and Ben there, and we were going to goof on there.  I never thought I'd see the day that Aunt would be hanging with the beautiful people.  You're at the same party as Madonna.  What is going on with you, man? 
[00:04:00]  And I saw Lisa Ling from The View.  Yeah.  I didn't want to say anything to her, just in case she heard any Star Jones comments.  And then...  Were you networking, Anthony?  Oh, I'm moving and shaking, Opie.  Are you going to be on The View soon?  Shut up.  I saw Michael Buffer, the let's get ready to rumble guy.  Yeah.  And then the biggest celebrity of them all comes in.  Not Madonna.  No.  Gwyneth Paltrow, she was there.  No?  Not her?  No, no, no. 
[00:04:30]  I didn't see her or Madonna.  Okay.  They must be in the back back room where it's a sludge like me and not allowed to go.  No?  Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman.  Comes in.  All of a sudden, I just see this little short black guy walk by.  I was like, oh my God, look, it's Gary Coleman.  And then all the brothers, like there are a bunch of hip-hop guys there and stuff, are  around Gary Coleman shaking his hand but laughing.  They're like, ah, look, it's my effing Gary Coleman.  Look at you short little nigga.  Come here, love him.  You know, and they're all like goofing on him. 
[00:05:00]  And he turned around and like walked right out again.  All right, I got to put someone in their place.  Michelle, what's up?  Opie, I think you're Dallas of Anthony.  No, why would you say that?  Because you got to hang out with the beautiful people and you didn't.  Michelle, let me set you straight, okay?  Both of us were invited to the party.  It was a no-brainer for me to say, no thank you.  Why?  Because I didn't want to go.  I don't like hanging out at those places.  You think I go to hang out?  First of all, I just wanted to say congratulations and hello to a good friend of the show, Mark 
[00:05:30]  Golan.  Right.  Who is the editor of Details.  That's one reason I went.  If we did that at the corner bar and played like, I don't know, video games or something,  I'd go.  You don't think it would be fun to hang out with me and Rick and Ben and goof on the New  York...  All right.  If we had our little gang together and we had a corner table and we could goof on all  the beautiful people...  That was the whole deal.  Yeah, but you went by yourself. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't know I was going by myself.  We all blew off the party and you still went.  I didn't know.  That's what makes me go, what the heck is that all about?  You do make a good point.  If we had our little group of guys together and we were at a table, yeah, I would have  loved it because then we could have goofed on everything.  Yeah.  That's what those are all about.  What do you think?  I'm going there to mingle with people.  There were so many, like, look-alike people.  You're walking around and it's like, oh my God, here it is.  Were you smoking cigars with Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff?  Yeah, that's what I was doing. 
[00:06:30]  I was just networking.  There were a whole bunch of JFK Jr. look-alikes.  Hey, Joe.  Go on.  Why wouldn't you want to go there last night?  There's probably a lot of rich chicks there, you know?  I don't.  It's not my scene.  Oh, and it's mine.  Come on.  Get her message.  All right.  And it's mine?  That's what I'm trying to say.  Dude, come on.  I think Ant and I are, like, kind of, like, going our own way.  Shut up.  What do you mean?  What are you going to do?  Shut up.  What are you on, drugs?  It used to that both of us would blow this off.  It wasn't our scene. 
[00:07:00]  But I guess it's now Anthony's scene.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  Is he selling out, Opie?  I think he's selling out.  He's got this.  I'm selling out.  He's sitting here across from me.  He's got one of those shiny black suits on now.  His nose up in the air, right?  Come on.  He's got a supermodel waiting for him outside the studio.  You know, he's left me behind.  What can I say?  You're in New York.  All of a sudden, you're the star now.  Right.  You know?  So much for the days of just getting hammered at the local pubs.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  That's my scene.  You should have seen how out of place. 
[00:07:30]  Like Earl at a Klan meeting.  That's how out of place I was.  Believe me.  And you sure you have enough time to go to the Yankee game with us tonight?  Or do you have one of these little soiree to go to?  With Gwyneth and Madonna.  I think Esquire Magazine is having a party tonight.  You go to that?  You're a tool, man.  I can't believe it.  Are you hoping the Yankees, you know, score early so they can leave for another shindig?  Maybe you'll get on the fashion show with Joe Rivers, Anthony.  Oh, I enjoy the hat and the ponytail. 
[00:08:00]  But the t-shirts.  You ought to do something different.  Anthony on the red carpet.  Is that what your goal is?  Is that what your goal is, Anthony?  Shut up, you jerk.  Listen to you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Here they come.  I got to tell you, more gay guys at this party, gay guys, than I've ever seen in my life.  Holy smoke.  You couldn't turn around with two seconds without two guys in a lip lock.  George.  Yo, Ed, man.  What's going on?  You're leaving your boy behind. 
[00:08:30]  He was, he should have come to this party.  I didn't want to go.  Crying, man.  Yo.  Which one is this good thing?  You don't bring me flowers anymore.  You know, it was supposed to be one of those things where we go to and, like, just hang  out and goof.  Did you do any blow with any of these top-notch celebrities, Anthony?  Oh, if I was packing my face with cocaine, free cocaine was just flowing like crazy.  No, I wasn't doing drugs.  So we're all scared. 
[00:09:00]  A lot of the faithful listeners are even scared.  They're thinking, Anthony might be coming a sellout now.  Well.  That he's going to be spending more time with the beautiful people instead of us.  If you saw how out of place I was at this shindig, it was retarded.  The help looked better than I did at this party.  Believe me.  By the way, Ant, your invitation for that puffy party came.  Oh, good.  Say.  Please.  Tell him an RSVP for me.  Would you, Rick?  Were you hanging with Albie Shore last night, Anthony?  Don, what's up? 
[00:09:30]  What's up?  I do want to know if Anthony's going to start changing the show a little bit, adding in  a little Madonna music, a little Michael Jackson.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  My new, a close personal friend.  Did Madonna ask you to be?  I'm thinking, Rick.  I didn't see Madonna.  And the old people told Anthony that they were all going to go, and they're probably laughing  their asses off right now.  Yeah.  And he actually went.  That's what I'm thinking.  All you guys conspired against me.  Yeah, we're all going, Ant.  We'll meet you there.  And I walk in alone.  And as a true... 
[00:10:00]  And we're probably there, just watching you laughing their asses off.  All right, Don.  He's got a point.  All right, thank you, Don.  You guys suck.  Chris from Jersey writing in the instant feedback.  Anthony, man, you've changed.  It used to be about the radio show, man.  Now it's all about your fancy friends and parties and cocaine, man.  You've changed.  And is it true that you have to leave the show early today because you've got to go house  hunting in the Hamptons?  Shut up. 
[00:10:30]  You guys are jackasses, man.  We could have had fun goofing on this whole thing.  Doc, what's going on?  Yeah, can I talk to Mr. High Society, please?  Is High Society around?  Our audience blows, man.  You're all a bunch of tools.  Mr. High Society now, huh?  High Society, 1027.  I love it.  It used to be we both came into work, talked about the show and stuff.  Now if I want to talk to Anthony, I've got to go through his agent.  Yeah, can I have a Chrissy Brinkley and Joe Joe for me? 
[00:11:00]  I don't know how they're doing on the Hamptons over there.  Unbelievable.  I go to one little shindig.  I thought, to tell you the truth, I thought this party was going to be like the one we  went to for Maxim, which was about a year ago.  And that was more my style.  There was like no celebrities.  It was in the Maxim office, I believe.  Right.  It was like an office party.  There was a pinball machine set up and they were having a pinball tournament.  And it was a little small buffet, a tub with some beers thrown in it on ice.  That's more my style. 
[00:11:30]  I like that.  I get there last night.  There's laser lights.  It's techno friggin' blast and music in this warehouse.  There's dance.  Oh yeah, Rick.  I was raising the roof.  That's it.  Me and Gwyneth were tripping the light.  Fantastic.  You friggin'.  Were you doing the mambo?  Yeah, mambo number five.  That's what I was doing.  Could we go find some music for Anthony so he feels comfortable today?  Oh, man.  Can we lower the lights too?  Yeah, we can lower the lights.  Did you get one of Donald Trump's leftovers, Anthony?  Yeah, that's it. 
[00:12:00]  That's what I was doing.  Jesus, man.  I hear Anthony's becoming a real sellout.  He's going to go make a movie now.  Now that you made all your connections.  Yeah, I was really networking.  I was standing in a corner like a wallflower.  Oh yeah, that's what happened.  Sipping my drink.  Yeah, I'm sure that's how it was.  Jack, what's up?  Pack his hands for a manicure, please.  And also, how gay is that situation?  Some guy lingering with a bunch of fags.  You made that special point to say there's the most gay people he's seen in his whole life. 
[00:12:30]  I just was saying there was a lot of gay people there.  A lot of gay people.  Looking for a little action later that night?  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  Oh, you got me.  Dude, I cannot tell you how out of place I was at this shindig.  Believe me.  Yeah, we all believe you.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, man, can I borrow some grapefruit pond or what?  I'm getting back going to all these parties. 
[00:13:00]  I hope you don't change that much, man.  Yeah, I'm going to all these parties.  I was supposed to go to the details party last night with Ben and Rick,  and we were going to hang out and goof on the New York, you know, society people  and celebrities and models and stuff.  I end up going there.  I'm stood up by my pals.  I'm alone at a party I had no effing business being at. 
[00:13:30]  None.  The paparazzi's there, the video cameras, they're taping, the models dancing,  and, of course, they pan by.  I'm there in my busted up leather and my hat.  Hey, what's up?  Another drink, please.  Say you are changing.  You're trying to start a new trend, even.  Yeah, because they all look alike, and I, like, look different,  so they're probably, ooh, there's the new style.  Wow.  Got to dress like a slob.  Chip, let's get a hat.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hey, John.  I'm worried about you. 
[00:14:00]  First you're watching soap operas.  Now you're going to parties with fags.  What's next?  You going to call Richard Gere and get a couple of gerbils?  What's next?  God, I love our audience.  I've got to keep telling myself that.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Yeah, Anthony.  Hey.  You're walking around sipping fine champagne with your pinky in the air now  instead of chugging beers with the boys?  Yeah, that's it.  That's what I was doing.  And your movie deal should be coming in any day now,  and then you won't have to take this abuse from our listeners anymore.  Absolutely.  Sure thing. 
[00:14:30]  You'll leave us all behind.  You'll be in California.  You know, you guys suck, man.  I was just showing support from Mark Golan.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  I get hell.  I just hope when you're in Hollywood and stuff,  and I come knocking on your door, you don't, like, kick me to the curb.  Hey.  Hey, remember me?  Hey, is this the O.P. and Thurston Howell III show?  Love me.  Love me.  So you get any phone numbers?  No, I didn't talk to anybody, man. 
[00:15:00]  Don't you?  I stood there.  I watched Jay from Clerks walk back and forth chasing supermodels.  You had to talk to someone.  I talked to the security guy when I was getting in.  Name?  I should be on the guest list.  I stamped my hand.  I walked in.  That was the last person I spoke to.  You're waiting on lines.  Thank God Studio 54 is not open anymore.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be right there.  You and Brooke Shields doing coke in the bathroom now.  Shut up. 
[00:15:30]  Dimitri.  Hello.  I danced with Anthony I last night.  You didn't.  Now, shut up.  Yes, you did.  You grabbed my hiney.  Yeah, okay.  You did.  That's what I was doing.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Could you hang up on this guy?  Oh, this is cute.  Yeah.  You guys are the biggest a-holes. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I was just boogying down to that.  Brian in Jersey.  Ann thinks he's some kind of rock star now.  Blowing coke with the stars.  Who the hell do you think you are?  Get all your new friends, the Baldwin brothers, and we'll have a big, huge fight.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The Park Avenue posse.  Dave, what's up?  Anthony, we're going to do lunch, babe. 
[00:16:30]  What do you say?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting nailed here.  Anthony, what's up?  Mr. Anthony, please.  I just want to let you know that your limousine will be downstairs at 7 o'clock.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I don't...  We will take you anywhere you'd like to go tonight, sir, and I'll make sure we have the  carpet out for you, sir.  I think he needs to go to the Esquire party tonight.  Oh, is that where I'm booked to go?  We'll be there.  Or is it Glamour Magazine tonight? 
[00:17:00]  Where are you going, Ian?  I need a chink to hold my umbrella if it's raining, like Kathy Lee.  Yeah, Tom and Nicole's people called.  They're all set for Sunday.  Oh, thank you, Rick, for setting that up.  That was such a goof, man.  I go to a party that we were invited to to support Mark Golan, and I catch hell because  Madonna was there.  There's pictures all over the post.  I'm surprised you didn't have any of them.  I haven't seen these pictures yet.  There's Gwyneth Paltrow hugging Madonna.  That's the same party you were at.  What happened to going to the strip clubs after the show? 
[00:17:30]  I would still go to the strip clubs.  Are you allowed to ride the subway still to the stadium tonight for the game, or do we  have to meet you out front?  Because I'm riding the damn subway.  I'm so different.  I'm going to these parties all the time.  Are they going to helicopter you in just in time for the game?  Jesus, how did this happen?  Or do you have to take the limo to read some movie scripts?  I mean, what the hell's going on with you?  Come on, man. 
[00:18:00]  Paul, what's up?  Anthony, first of all, we all know that I don't like that third-faced partners of your  dopey, okay?  We know that's right off the bat.  But you, you backstabbed dopey.  Shame on you.  How did I backstab?  Just yesterday, he was saying about how you guys are not like Howard.  You don't go for the approval of anybody.  And then pushing your little you goes dancing.  And you put glitter on your hair, too, you fag.  What's the matter with you?  Come on.  What do you want?  A hairdressing appointment?  I'll come by and do your nails, too. 
[00:18:30]  Don't chase yourself.  Shame on you.  Don't chase yourself.  You don't understand why I was there.  Paul, I hate you, too.  But you're pretty funny today, man.  Does anyone understand why I was there?  We're trying to understand.  We've said it a thousand times.  It was there because Rick and Ben were showing up, and we were going to goof on this.  If you don't understand by now, this is like an intervention.  We're a little scared.  This wasn't like...  You've been heading in this direction for a while.  Okay, so you think...  I went to this party thinking,  Ooh, boy, I got an invite.  This is great.  This is going to be my in to New York's high society. 
[00:19:00]  I'm going to rub elbows with celebrities.  I'm going to network.  This is going to be great for me.  Right.  Or, hey, this will be a good goof.  Me, Rick, Ben.  We'll hang out.  We'll do some...  We'll have some free drinks and goof on the celebrities.  Which one sounds more like me?  The first one.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That is so far from the truth, man.  Yeah.  So far from the truth.  De Niro's on Line 7. 
[00:19:30]  Wants Act in his next movie.  O.J. on Line 9.  Was that party with Act?  Gee, it's all out.  So when do you run for office?  You have to be famous for a few more years?  Yeah, yeah.  Then I'll do that whole thing.  All right, all right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  You're on to me.  Well, it's all the cats out of the bag.  I'm a big high society homo.  You guys are mean.  It's soft and done delivery, my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porno. 
[00:20:00]  I want porno.  I want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  All you people with your children make me eff-ing sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psychotic.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Opie and Anthony, 1027.  WNEW.  Calling all freaks.  It was reported in the paper today that Sylvester Stallone plans to do Rocky VI. 
[00:20:30]  Rocky VI.  He's been into that, is he?  That old gag.  How old is Rocky? 
[00:21:00]  How old is he?  He's 50, 51.  Maybe even 52 at this point.  He can't fight.  He can't box.  What is that?  Rocky VI.  Rocky VI.  After two, it was done, right?  Did you like Rocky III even, Anthony?  Three was Clubber Lang.  That was good.  Hey, woman.  Say, woman.  Why don't you come over?  I'll show you a real man.  That was a good one, but then it got ridiculous.  No, you're right. 
[00:21:30]  I must break you.  Dolph Lundgren.  That sucked.  And the other one with the guy with the age.  Wasn't Dolph Lundgren supposed to be the next action hero?  What happened to him?  Didn't quite work out for him.  Didn't quite pan out for him, huh?  I'm trying to think of what this will be.  Like, is he going to fight, or is he going to be like, you know, take a young boxer under  his wing or something?  No, he already did the take the boxer under his wing.  Tommy Morrison.  That was Rocky V, right?  And with his son and all that? 
[00:22:00]  Rocky VI.  I come out with a little rascal.  What's he going to do?  Hey, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey's dead.  Hey, someone changed my Depend undergarment.  Changed my Depend undergarment!  Comes out in the Depend instead of the boxing trunks.  Oh, yeah.  I'm the champ.  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't think that'll go. 
[00:22:30]  I'm the champ.  I just got myself.  Paulie, change my underwear.  Eh, I don't think, uh, I don't think it'll gross, uh, like, uh, the first one did.  I don't think it'll do that well.  Come on.  I would never go see Rocky VI.  Not in the theater, anyway.  The hell no.  If it was on HBO 2 late at night, you might check it out.  Maybe.  Maybe he's going to do, like, the whole Muhammad Ali thing. 
[00:23:00]  Like, now all the time.  Didn't he do that, too, where he was already, like, getting all punchy?  Yeah, he was getting a little...  I'm retarded.  I'm retarded.  But how can we tell Rocky?  Uh, me.  Uh.  Honduras.  Let's go to Ray.  Ray, what's up?  Yo, what are you talking about?  Rocky III is one of the best Rockies.  Hulk Hogan, the ultimate male versus the ultimate meatball?  You know, that was pretty good.  You're 100% right.  I got it confused with two.  I'll be honest.  Well, you like Rocky, too. 
[00:23:30]  You tell me, like, every time you see it, no matter what, that last 10 seconds, they're  both on the floor.  You're screaming, wanting Rocky to get up there.  I liked one, two, and three.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  I mean, four was cheesy at the end with, like, Sylvester Sloan talking about...  Four blue.  All the, you know, I don't know.  Yeah, four kind of did blow.  How many times can you do it?  Okay, Rocky gets another shot.  Oh, he loses confidence in himself.  He can't do it.  But Adrian gives him the friggin' go-ahead, and he goes and kicks up. 
[00:24:00]  I can't do it, Adrian.  I can't do it.  Rocky, you can do it.  Oh, okay, I can do it.  And then he does it.  It's probably going to be like his son's going to become a boxer now or something, you know?  Yeah.  And Paulie's going to be drunk and screw something up.  Yeah.  And Rocky's going to have to defend him and his honor and blah, blah, blah.  Maybe it is his son.  Blah, blah, blah.  Do you think it'll be like Rocky's son will be the boxer?  Yeah.  I can't picture it.  They already did Tommy Gunn.  I mean, what else could they do?  Yeah.  And who could forget the great music that came out of this Rocky film? 
[00:24:30]  This is Rocky 3, Eye of the Tiger.  Go for it.  Eye of the Tiger rock.  I can't do it.  Not keep your left out.  Not jab a little more.  Go to the body.  Eye of the Tiger.  Eye of the Tiger.  All right.  Thanks, Greg.  All right.  They got him dancing to the music.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do.  He's like jumping back and forth.  I don't know how to do this.  You know what I mean?  All right, Dan.  This damn song saved Survivor's career.  Survivor.  Survivor was done. 
[00:25:00]  Rocky 6, the Rocky lean, mean, fat-burning, grilling machine.  Yeah, it's good.  Look at it.  It burns the fat right out of it.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rock.  Maybe he'll be fighting Adrian in Rocky 6.  That's a good one.  He's just a drunk, bitter ex-boxer.  That'd be a good one. 
[00:25:30]  They don't want to do that, though.  It'll probably be his son.  Or he opens up like a boxing school.  There's the next, like, hard-headed Italian guy that wants to fight.  They kind of did all that in 5, though.  I mean, the boxer, Tommy Morrison.  Yeah.  Taking him under his wing and the son getting involved.  Stefano, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah, no, supposedly, from what I heard, too, is that he's going to be training his son.  They showed a glimpse of it in Rocky 5 where it's always training.  His son's going to be like Italian Stallion Jr. or something. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  The dramatic scene is going to be, Adrian's going to take a crunch on a glass table while  he's going to eat it.  All right.  That's the bit we want to play from the O&A archives.  Thank you, Stefano.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, real fast.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what are they going to do?  Eye of the balloon knot next?  What, are they crazy?  Yeah.  Someone's saying that Rocky's going to come out of retirement for this movie.  Dude.  Is that the...  Chunk, are you just saying that or what?  O&A, I read it on the web.  I go to a movie site all the time, and that's what they said.  He's going to come out for a charity fight. 
[00:26:30]  And, of course, he's going to lose at the end, but believe it or not, sounds pretty  cheesy to me.  Yeah.  Nah.  He has nothing else to do in Hollywood again.  I think he's stretching for that one.  What do you guys think?  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  All right, fellas.  Now people are saying Rocky dies.  Rocky dies?  Come on.  Rocky 4 set up Rocky 6?  Let's see.  How?  Fred, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Ever since Rocky 4, like before Rocky 4 came out, everybody would say, no, his son's going  to be a boxer.  His son's going to be a boxer.  It's not going to happen. 
[00:27:00]  Everybody's been saying that for the longest time.  Why?  Of course, every time another Rocky came out, after three, everybody thought it was going  to be his son.  He's going to train his son to be a boxer.  Yeah, but now he's like in his 50s.  He can't fight.  I know, but they're going to do something stupid, but there's no way they're going to  make his son the boxer.  Everybody's been expecting it.  That would be stupid.  It would be the worst movie ever.  Well, yeah.  It's going to blow.  It's going to blow.  I'm also working on stop, or my mom will shoot, too. 
[00:27:30]  I think that has a better chance of getting some people in the seats.  I am the age spots.  I am the liver spots.  Dave from Jersey.  Rocky 6.  Sean Connery wrote it.  Rocky comes home to his cheating wife.  He throws the babysitter out.  Babysitter.  And beats his wife with a sit and spin.  Yes.  She's playing with the children on a sit and spin.  They make up in the end.  It's a babysitter.  All right, Ayo. 
[00:28:00]  Why don't we play this from the O&A archives?  It's called Rocky and the Cleveland Steamer.  All right.  We're in the middle of some movie countdown, and then Anthony just goes off.  Check this out.  We'll be back.  Let's just run down the top ten sports films of all time, according to USA.  Tenth place, Raging Bull.  Ninth place, Anthony, Slapshot. 
[00:28:30]  That should have been higher on the list.  Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think.  Eighth place, Chariots of Fire.  Seventh place, Caddyshack.  Top ten sports films of all time, according to USA.  Number six, Bryan Song.  Who could sit through that?  Number five, Bull Dorum.  Number four, Rocky.  I thought Rocky should be number one.  Hey, uh, Ezra, I got a glass table.  Why don't you squat over it and take a dump, and I'll be underneath you. 
[00:29:00]  Wasn't that written somewhere in some whore's book?  We interviewed the whores from that book, and they claim, according to their book,  that Rocky was into, um, watching, uh, girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  But, you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And, like, watching this f***er open up and just dump it out of me.  Oh, my God, I'm out of your face! 
[00:29:30]  Out of my face, Mickey!  Ah!  Ah!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table.  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's how I like you.  Sloppy.  I didn't start this!  You started this! 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, give me some.  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  What's that I see?  Oh, look, I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She ate peanuts, Mickey!  Mickey!  You know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything too fast to go.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's the little driver.  Oh, you know, I don't know where Adrian went. 
[00:30:30]  Adrian must have left the building.  But, hey, Pauly.  Pauly, get over here and squat on the table, Pauly.  Pauly, squat on the table.  Oh, Pauly!  Give it to me, Pauly!  Oh!  Oh, Pauly! 
[00:31:00]  Big fat ass, Pauly!  Oh!  Oh!  Hey, Pauly, where are you going?  Now who's going to squat over the table?  Hell yeah.  Hey, Mickey!  Hey, Mickey, come on over there.  Squat on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey!  Oh, no, look, it's first blood!  Mickey, you two first blood! 
[00:31:30]  Not me!  I didn't start this!  You started!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Doggy's full of crab now!  Oh, great.  Okay, where's my check? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, whatever.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah!  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Hey!  Okay.  Oh, boy.  You bad.  Yeah!  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.

I have been here for seven years. 
[00:37:00]  I've been here for seven years.  Now we're having fun.  Holy Jesus.  Well, hello, everyone.  This is the twisted and demented radio show called O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, man. 
[00:37:30]  Funniest thing I've ever seen last night.  Unbelievable.  I hope you caught it after the Sopranos.  We warned everyone.  We said watch the Bellevue special right after the Sopranos.  Yeah, there was no reason to turn away from HBO last night after the Sopranos.  The special on Bellevue.  Oh, my God.  They could put that on every effing week.  I would watch it right after the Sopranos.  Every week, different people.  Screw Survivor.  I was telling everyone in the back office we should do real world Bellevue. 
[00:38:00]  Real world Bellevue.  Yeah, you start getting to know some of the people.  Un-effing believable.  Un-effing believable.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I've been here seven years.  Seven years.  Hey, Rick, you got the crazy lady, too?  The crazy lady.  You got Cheryl?  The one with the glasses.  You got clips of her?  I got Cheryl.  She's a...  Well, this special was great.  They went through a few people.  I don't know.  Half dozen, dozen people, I guess, maybe.  And at Bellevue. 
[00:38:30]  And there was that guy.  I hate this place.  He would just yell that around the halls.  Wouldn't shut up.  And then he'd just stop out of nowhere and kind of look around like, what the F was I just doing?  Looks at his watch like, okay, I'm done.  Yeah, I'm done for now.  He does that, what, for 40 minutes every single day of his life?  Every day.  Every day.  We got to go right to the phones because everyone picked up on this.  That's why we started the show with a, I hate this place guy.  Dave, what's up?  Oh, guys.  That was probably one of the funniest American undercovers they've done. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, without a doubt.  And you know what?  They purposely put these people on TV for us to laugh.  I got a strange feeling.  In about a few weeks, you guys are going to be walking around the place going, we've been here for three years.  Three years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Earl doesn't work here.  We hate this place.  You know what?  We went out for lunch today and we're walking.  We walked about four or five blocks.  And the whole time, there was like five of us.  We're just, all of us.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here. 
[00:39:30]  The medication doesn't work.  You know what?  A ton of people went into work today seeing the exact same thing.  I was doing that.  The looks we got on the street were priceless because obviously a lot of people didn't see the special last night.  But one guy would star.  It's a great new game.  Do it.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  We could just look around and say, yes, I am God.  I would like to go to court.  Yeah.  Tell people, I am God.  Yeah.  I hate this place.  Oh, man.  How are they going to top that one?  I don't know.  There is no way they can top that.  Nothing works here.  It's going to be tough.  The medication doesn't work.  I've been here for seven years. 
[00:40:00]  Seven years.  All right, Dave.  Go to Hammer.  Bye.  He rocked.  That guy was the star of the show last night.  Well, him and, of course, the girl Cheryl.  Yeah.  We're going to get to Cheryl in a minute.  The sad part about that guy, he knows exactly what he's doing.  Yeah.  No doubt about it.  All of a sudden, there's something in his head, and he's got to start saying this crap  over and over again.  Yeah.  And he starts saying it, and he knew exactly where he had to go.  He had to go back into the seclusion room.  Go into the room.  He knew the drill.  All right, I've got to take my glasses off.  You're going to close the door, and I'm going to be in here until I stop. 
[00:40:30]  He was saying that as they were giving him the medication.  Right.  And he downs it and then just keeps going.  Nothing worries.  Here.  Here.  I hate this place.  Zach, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Did you see the lady that said, oh, yeah, she owns Microsoft computers and all that other  stuff?  Yeah, she owns a computer company, she said.  She didn't even know what she was talking about.  They wheeled her in.  She was so incoherent.  And, yeah, her talking was confused. 
[00:41:00]  They were saying that.  And then they just know what drugs to give her.  Yeah.  All right, we'll give her this, this, this, and that ought to calm her down enough that  we can figure it out.  And she was like, oh, yeah, you better let me out because my computer would just blow  up everything.  Yeah.  You better watch out.  My computer, she's like the boss of a company and no one's going to get paid if I'm in here.  And all of a sudden they just go, okay, give her some Paxil, some Klonopin.  Yeah.  Give her this, that, that.  That'll hook her up until we can talk to her.  And then they show her a few days later, I guess, or a week later in her room and she's  like, well, yeah, these drugs have certain side effects.  All right, right. 
[00:41:30]  And you can understand what she was saying.  All right, see you later, ONA.  All right, Zach.  Let's go to Jared, who's next on WNAW.  Jared, what's up?  Oh, ONA, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yo, I think after that little opening, I'm going to check myself into Bellevue.  Enough of it.  Jesus.  Well, we had a pound at home just like they did on the show last night.  Yeah, it isn't effective unless you do it so many times and people are like, oh, my  God.  Because they're interviewing other patients at Bellevue and you can still hear the guy in  the background.  I hate this place.  Been here for seven years.  I've been here for seven years.  All right, I'm going to throw this out there.  I'm the only one looking at that woman, Shaolin, going, holy ass Bubba Ray Dudley has checked 
[00:42:00]  the cell phone from Bellevue Hospital.  Bubba Ray Dudley, the chick with the taped up glasses.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  Oh, my God.  And then they give her a brand new set of glasses and she effed those up as well.  Yeah, those are taped up.  They never really explain why she kept messing up her glasses.  She probably throws them down or something.  It throws them at people.  She's a nut.  She looked like Dr. Melfi from The Sopranos.  She sounded like her a little bit. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  After The Sopranos, I didn't think it would get much better last night.  That was a good episode.  I couldn't watch her before they gave her new glasses with the chocolate in her mouth.  Stinky goes, oh, my God.  It looks like she was eating squid ink.  She's talking.  And all the strings of spit and chocolate in her teeth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's disgusting.  And then what does Opie do?  He runs up to the TV in the office and starts making out with her on the TV screen.  It's disgusting. 
[00:43:00]  It looked like blood or something dripping.  It was just.  She had a chocolate bar in front of her.  It was chocolate.  And then they put the new glasses on.  He goes, oh, you're so beautiful.  You know, they're crazy.  You don't have to lie to them.  You know what?  I think the people that work in Bellevue are just this close to being psychotic themselves.  And then when that other chick, the one that loved her daddy that died.  Oh, my God.  She's standing there with the fat woman, Cheryl.  And Cheryl starts accusing the doctor of having a thing for the other girl. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You want to seduce her?  She's all jealous.  Well, nothing wrong with hot mental patients.  You've got to love that.  She'd be an easy score, huh?  I think we got.  Boy, there's a vulnerable chick.  We got some audio from her, I believe.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up.  Oh, this is the girl that looks like Bubba Ray Dudley.  Bubba Ray Dudley with the taped up glasses.  She got in a confrontation with the hot mental patient, Cheryl. 
[00:44:00]  And I guess they wanted them to make up and hug and stuff.  I can't make up.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't want to make up with her because she got me into trouble.  You're a forgiving person.  That was a long time ago, and we're going to have to forget about that and work on now.  And you think she's so pretty that you want to seduce her, don't you? 
[00:44:30]  No, I don't.  I feel like you have the hots for her and everything.  I don't have the hots for anybody.  Jesus.  You have the hots for her.  Because she was that chick.  She was, you know, for a mental patient and for what was going on in there, she was all  right looking, you know?  A little weird when she took her leather jacket off and started dancing around to daddy's  home to stay.  The girl obviously has some problems.  They said ever since she was 17.  And then she's talking about her father. 
[00:45:00]  She pulls this picture out and goes, he had a heart attack in front of me.  And I didn't know what to do.  And I didn't know CPR.  He died in front of me.  And then daddy's home is playing in the background.  And she's dancing with herself in this room, looking up, going, I love you, dad.  It was so awful.  I openly laughed.  She had no bra on it, which made it a little special till.  Yeah, she's got like nips, but she's a little saggy.  She's a little dumpy in the ass and stuff. 
[00:45:30]  But as far as kooks go, yeah.  And she was dancing to Shaft for a while.  Yeah, beforehand she was dancing to Shaft.  Daddy's home.  I love you, daddy.  Still.  Yeah, what's up, going on?  Stinky's laughing so hard he had to leave the phone for a minute.  What's up, Stu?  It's horrible.  What's up?  I'm watching the promo before it starts.  Yeah.  And that chick is like, she's like, don't laugh at retarded people or whatever. 
[00:46:00]  No, no.  Don't laugh at, yeah, mental illness people or whatever.  Dude, I was rolling on the floor.  My girlfriend turns on to me.  She's like, you are a sick F.  How could you not laugh at that?  It was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I know it's tragic and all, but how can you not laugh at that?  She's got the twisted glasses all taped off.  She's got, like, the squid ink dripping out of her mouth.  The squid ink.  She's telling us not to laugh at her.  All right, Stu.  All right, later, guys.  People who suffer mental illness are suffering from pain, and it's nothing to laugh at, and 
[00:46:30]  it's so unfunny.  Oh, my God.  But they put that clip there because it was funny.  She looked like a, well, she is a nut.  And even the nuts have the pecking order.  Yeah.  Like, she's online.  She's losing her effing ass.  She's just like, yeah, freaking out.  All the other nuts waiting in the food line think she's a nut.  Yeah.  And they're putting their fingers up like antennas behind her head. 
[00:47:00]  Then they just start singing happy birthday for no apparent reason.  How cool is it that nuts realize that someone else is nuttier?  Is nuttier.  Like, there's a pecking order.  I love it.  And then they all go in for food, and the one black guy that was online, he walks in and  he goes, we getting pizza.  Right.  And, like, makes his gang sign.  And it's not like he's the tough guy in there.  What's this clip?  This is the opening clip when they're online.  Okay, here it is.  We are getting pizza, which we never get, hardly ever. 
[00:47:30]  All we get is mashed potatoes.  Mashed pizza.  We don't get cold, so I was just in a diner.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  James, what's going on?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You know, if you didn't watch that show last night, it sounded like Opie losing his S.  Right.  When he goes, like, nothing works here.  Yeah, we're going to play that clip for the next year. 
[00:48:00]  I wasn't watching the TV last night.  I was listening to it, and all of a sudden, it's like, Obie's on?  It's true, though.  Nothing works here.  I did, James.  We've been here for three years.  Tim's got a good question on the seven.  The medication doesn't work.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  What is this guy?  Incremented or what?  Did he start at one and work his way up, or did he just hit it right that it was a seven?  They don't know why he says seven years.  Yeah, but he's been there seven years, right? 
[00:48:30]  No, it's seven years.  Like, when he started, did he go, I've been here one year.  Nothing works here.  Yo, syndication when he hit 70.  All right.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Years.  Fast forward 20 years.  Ant and I at WNEW.  We've been here for 20 years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Right.  Heh, heh.  Heh, heh, heh, heh.  I hate this place.  We're the string.  Oh, that guy had a good question. 
[00:49:00]  He hung up.  Oh, well.  I want to hear more of the Cheryl clip.  We got more Cheryl.  Cheryl number two is pretty funny, too.  Cheryl?  What is she doing in this clip?  I think this is when she's trying to talk, and then she loses it, and they start singing  to her.  This picture is not for kids.  This picture is for the hell that was mean, both.  What I'm trying to say is that you...  What I'm trying to say is...  Let me just speak.  This is a funny conversation.  What I'm trying to say is that when people are in pain and they need help...  No, I know. 
[00:49:30]  Let me talk, please.  I know, I know.  Please let me talk, goddammit.  No, no, no.  I'm trying to say...  I can't take it with her.  Let me talk.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Ah, bring it on a day.  Happy birthday to you.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Oh, goddammit.  How do you go from... 
[00:50:00]  Hey, hey, I know, I take it like a happy birthday.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, boys, how you doing today?  All right, hey.  Okay.  When she pulled out that picture of her father, tell me that did not look like Rodney Dangerfield,  but that shack is something right out of Caddyshack.  Hey, thumbs up.  Hey, I dropped dead of a heart attack.  Hey, look at my loony daughter.  Boy, what an easy mark.  I don't know.  All right, Brian.  All right, boy.  What an easy mark she'd be, though.  Hey, how you doing?  Unless you just broke up with a boyfriend, so...  Joe, boyfriend.  Who was her boyfriend? 
[00:50:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, what up, losers?  Hey.  Yo, you guys are messed up, bro.  You better make reservations to hell because you guys are going there.  See, you guys are too scared to laugh.  That was hilarious last night.  Yeah, you're too scared to laugh, bro.  I ain't going to laugh at that poor girl, bro.  She ain't all there, man.  What's wrong with you guys?  HBO purposely put that on TV knowing that people would laugh at it.  Right.  Yeah, what is it, Comedy Central over there?  Some.  I think so.  Might as well be.  Yeah, sure.  That was funnier than anything I've seen on Comedy Central lately. 
[00:51:00]  You guys are going to hell, bro.  That's it.  You better make...  Whatever.  That's all right.  We're already there.  It's called AnyW.  I've been here for three years.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Hey, man, that is tragic and all that, but how could you not laugh at that guy?  How could you not laugh at that guy?  I know.  He's walking down the hall.  They've got the camera on him.  It's building up in him, and he just starts blurting it out.  Come on.  At least we had the balls to admit on the air that we openly laughed. 
[00:51:30]  There's probably people at home that were laughing to themselves like,  Oh, my God.  I hope no one sees me laughing at this.  I can't laugh.  I can't laugh.  Very unfortunate.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't even talked about this guy yet.  Dennis.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, how are you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen.  I thought the most funniest part was the guy who had the mass problem.  Six years.  Six years, I believe, he had that problem.  No, no, no.  He mass for six straight hours.  Six straight hours. 
[00:52:00]  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Six straight...  Where he pretty much forgets to live his life.  He doesn't eat.  He doesn't go to the bathroom.  He just clanks.  That was amazing.  Amazing.  Another thing that I wanted to touch on was the guy who kept repeating himself.  Yeah.  This guy was on literally 12 different type of medications.  And every time they gave him one, he seemed like it didn't faze him.  Right.  It's just normal, normal, normal stuff.  Scott, also online, too, has something to say.  Scott.  Can somebody explain to me how do you jerk for six hours a day?  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:52:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You can't say that.  They dump out of the J-O word these days.  All right.  How do you pull your fun?  And you can't even say the M word.  Don't say...  Look, look.  Dude, dude.  Just say crank it.  How do you pull your crank for six hours a day?  And they didn't even explain.  Did he do it six hours straight?  Did he, like, take a break and go to work and come home for lunch and do it?  He'd just go six hours at a clip.  No, he lost his job or whatever.  Had to make a leave of absence. 
[00:53:00]  He was doing it for six straight hours.  He'd sit in front of the computer and just pull it.  I thought they'd show him pulling it while he was in the hospital, too.  But they didn't even show that.  But the thing is, let me tell you,  at his age and that whole thing going on,  you know, you got to work.  You can't just do that.  But I remember being like, you know, 13.  You're just cranking forever.  You finish.  You start back up again.  That's because you do.  It's the best thing ever.  That's because you can reload pretty quickly.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  But, I mean, this guy's sitting in front of his computer.  And then he...  Did you hear that thing that was said also?  He noticed...  Or he didn't know he was being observed.  Like, he must have been by an open window doing this.  Or his wife.  Or, well, I don't know.  The way he said being observed,  it sounded worse than if it was just his wife.  He was throwing his web everywhere.  Throwing web.  He was throwing that web all over his room.  But, I mean, I just sit there,  you know, six hours in front of the computer. 
[00:54:00]  Ah, I'm going to blow off work today.  I'm just going to sit here and crank it for a while.  I'm going to toss another web.  Here it comes.  And then what about when he's rubbing the shoulder of the other psychotic lady?  Oh, at the end of the show?  Yeah.  He's just like...  One of the women is totally breaking down,  saying,  I've got to get out of here!  And he was next to her,  and he figured he'd console her a little.  Right.  So he starts massaging her shoulder,  but he's just got this dead, blank stare on his face.  And you know he just wants to start yanking it. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  Hey, Judge, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, funny?  All right.  I didn't get to see the special,  but when you were playing the intro,  I thought it was a new Brian Regan bit.  I was ready for him to start saying snow cone.  Snow cone.  Nothing works here.  Been here for seven years.  All right.  A couple more, and we'll move on.  Don't worry.  You've got to check out the special if you haven't seen it yet.  It's twisted.  Twisted funny.  Yeah.  Tim, what's up?  Guys, that was hysterical last night.  Did you see that lady who said she was getting radiation from the CIA? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And she was sitting in the corner,  and she's blocking with, like, a manila envelope.  She said, this protects me.  Yeah, she has a manila envelope protecting her from the radiation  that the CIA is beaming into her head.  And she's got to keep moving around so they can't get a fix on her.  Yeah.  It always throws them off.  Everyone knows you need the tinfoil hat to combat the CIA's radiation.  A manila envelope's crazy.  Like an antenna.  And she's hiding her head with the manila envelope.  Oh, hysterical.  All right.  I tried to stay up and watch it on the West Coast Channel,  but I crapped out.  How fun would it be?  It'll be on a bunch of times. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, break out the VCR tapes, everybody.  Primetime A1 television.  Dude, how fun would it be to just go into there and just F with them?  You know their background.  Like CIA woman?  And just sit next to her.  I'm with the CIA.  You're on to us,  and now we have to implant something in your head.  And just, like, completely F them up.  Come on, that's comedy.  That's comedy.  That would rock.  Well, here's Cheryl, the Bubba Ray Dudley chick.  This is her dream, right?  Yeah, this is her dream at the end.  I think this is my favorite clip of Cheryl. 
[00:56:00]  My dream is to get out of the hospital  and to live a happy life with freedom  and roast beef  and Swiss cheese wrapped around once, twice,  and a big Coke.  Oh, boy.  Swiss cheese wrapped around. 
[00:56:30]  Roast beef.  Roast beef.  Wow, a bunch of people getting pissed at me.  Scott from Bridgewater,  what's your problem?  Hope you should suck on a horse egg.  I've been in a few of these places, so.  Oh, yeah?  I think I could openly laugh at this crap.  But have you lived there?  No, not for me personally.  He was there for seven years.  Not for me personally.  They seem nice.  They seem like, you know,  you get a nice room,  you get to walk around in your PJs the whole day,  and you're on drugs.  Kind of sounds cool. 
[00:57:00]  And there's easy chicks for the picking  if you want to work it.  It's an easy work.  You could be like, what's his name?  One floor over the cuckoo's nest.  You're just there because,  hey, I kind of like this better than life.  Chris, what's up?  How easy would it be to get laid  by that chick with the glasses  if you're really desperate?  Hey, guys,  that old lady that was talking to her,  she came in crazy, right?  They put her in the bed,  and every time the doctor would talk about it,  she'd prop up in the bed  like Dracula out of the coffin  and yell,  I don't want this. 
[00:57:30]  Go up yourself.  You ever heard it off?  The alcoholic lady.  Yeah, yeah,  a little crazy.  She was like a witch.  Yeah.  She was drunk,  and the doctor's explaining  what's wrong with her.  She's laying in the bed behind him,  and he's just like,  yeah, she was brought in.  She's intoxicated.  I'm not drunk,  you mother effing ass head.  You a-hole.  She was cursing like a sailor.  And then they get her  a couple of days after being in a detox,  and she's like,  well, I did drink a lot,  and I went and got home. 
[00:58:00]  Believe me,  that one was a little too frightening for me.  It's a box with wine in it.  A box with wine in it.  I call it box of wine.  That was a little too...  Here's the guy who thinks he's God.  Have you been in building before?  Oh, many times.  Many times?  I've been hospitalized over 30 times.  Nobody believes any of us.  They all say that I'm crazy.  But then that's to be expected.  Who would believe  the second coming of Christ  is the second coming of Christ?  If they believed me,  then it wouldn't be believable.  He said that he didn't... 
[00:58:30]  Hey, man,  the guy makes a good point.  Yeah.  Who the hell's going to believe anyone?  Right.  What if he comes back  and he tells everyone?  No one's going to believe him.  No one's going to...  He's going to be in Bellevue.  Christ in Bellevue.  I've been waiting all these years,  and there he is in Bellevue,  and no one's believing him.  Oh, he's a black guy.  Oh.  Well...  Didn't you see the drawing,  the latest drawing of Christ?  No.  I think Christ had some color.  I saw the pictures of Christ.  They look like nude women  with whipped cream on them, 
[00:59:00]  as per the way Rick is posing them these days  on the Jesus Christ pose.  My new pose.  We got a new pose.  We do have to take a break.  All right,  why don't we take a quick break?  Yeah,  because we're upsetting people.  I'm seeing names on instant feedback  I don't usually see.  People checking in for the first time,  Hopi.  Right.  You two should burn in hell.  The reason these people are like that  is because of people like you  who don't understand them.  Look.  Hey.  Twat.  Dayoni.  Twat. 
[00:59:30]  They're not like that  because of people like us  that don't understand them.  They're lunatics.  I hope you two dumbasses  end up in a mental hospital.  We could.  I've...  And maybe then you'll understand.  No, we won't,  because we'll be crazy.  But believe me,  after three years at N.E.W.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Come on,  that guy was a star last night.  All right,  we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  Two, one, two.  Good evening,  ignorant pigs. 
[01:00:00]  Put down your crack pipes  and your beer bongs  and pay attention.  I'm a virgin.  Hey!  The Hopi and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade of meat.  N.E.W.  O.P. and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  W.N.E.W. 
[01:00:30]  Wake the hip-hop?  Hey, we're getting a request  for Buddy Epson singing.  Hey, can we get the Buddy Epson  singing thing real fast?  All right, please.  I don't like it.  Hi, Anthony, 
[01:01:00]  if I can.  Yeah.  The great Buddy Epson  singing.  Come and listen to the story  by the man named  the poor mountaineer.  Barely kept his family fed.  And then one day,  oh, he never,  when I,  I'm still writing it,  when people,  I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:01:30]  We got a lot of negative email  on that one.  Use it or lose it.  For the record,  the publicist told us  or said that Buddy sings  a very interesting version  of the song.  Oh, I thought you were going to say  the publicist called  and was pissed.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  They encouraged us.  They say, hey,  have Buddy sing.  He does a good version  of the theme song.  Yeah, we thought he had  some kind of a parody version,  you know. 
[01:02:00]  So we asked him  and that was what we got.  All right,  let's go to the phones.  212-757-1027.  Stan, what's going on?  Hey,  I just wanted to let  Anthony know  today's Tom Broko's birthday.  Is it?  How old is Tom Broko?  I don't know.  I just know it's his birthday.  I figured I'd say happy birthday.  All right,  thank you.  Maybe we can talk to him later.  I wonder how old he is today.  I don't know.  Tom Broko, 
[01:02:30]  NBC Nightly News.  I'd like to thank everyone  here at NBC Nightly News  for throwing me  this fabulous  birthday bash  on my  61st birthday.  Tom,  would you like a hit  for your birthday?  I'm 61.  Sure.  Let me pass this over  to you over here.  Let me get that.  There you go.  Wow, 
[01:03:00]  that's some good crap.  Unbelievable.  I plan on going out  to a couple of raves tonight  and take some eggs.  I'm going to hook up  with some ladies  and get my F on  and bust three nuts  because that's the kind of  guy I am. 
[01:03:30]  Who wants to be Tom's B.I.?  I'm going to go out  with J.Lo  and shoot up some places.  Tom Broko,  NBC Nightly News.  Last night,  Tom Broko  shooting up a bar  with his new girlfriend,  J.Lo.  J.Lo.  J.Lo.  J.Lo.  J.Lo.  I love that booty.  Your voice is effed up today.  That's a great ask.  Well,  if I wasn't doing  the QVC 
[01:04:00]  Shop at Home  card guy,  perhaps my voice  wouldn't be so effed up.  Don't forget  Dudley Moore.  Wonderful.  And everyone else.  Mr. Broko.  Yes.  It's imitating today.  Busy little day  for Tom Broko  here on NBC Nightly News.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  I see Ronald Reagan's  on the phone.  Oh, really?  I wonder what he's  going to sound like today.  Tom Broko,  NBC Nightly News.  Ronald Reagan's 
[01:04:30]  not that.  Ronald Reagan's  birthday.  Damn, I can't say that  in a right.  Ronald Reagan's  90th birthday.  Joey Big Arms  from Fairlawn.  Prior to talking  with Ronald Reagan,  Anthony,  make sure you go  to the bathroom  and Rick is handling  the phone systems  so there are no problems.  Then you can finally  talk to one of your heroes.  That would be nice.  Wouldn't that be good?  Good.  Is he on the phone?  Well,  let's pick him up. 
[01:05:00]  Pop him down.  All right.  Would you like to talk  to the former president?  Yes.  Finally, Anthony?  Pop him down.  It's kind of strange.  I'm always the one  interviewing him.  I know.  You're nowhere  to be seen.  All right.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan,  how are you today?  Hello?  Hello?  Hmm.  He's not there  for some reason.  I hear noises  in the background.  Maybe he fell again  or maybe they're waking him up  so he could talk to us today.  I hope it's not a problem  with the phone equipment. 
[01:05:30]  Maybe I should go out  and make sure  that Jack is connected.  No, I think Rick  could handle that, Anthony.  Can Rick handle that?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Right, Stinky?  Rick's working on the phone  to make sure it's okay?  He's playing with it.  I don't know.  I better check that out.  No, no, no.  We really want you  to talk to Ronald Reagan today.  I would love to.  It's an honor.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan,  how are you  on your 90th birthday?  I hear the phone.  I hear it, too.  But see, he's there.  I don't think...  I think it's a problem  with the phone line.  I better go and make sure 
[01:06:00]  the jack is plugged in  because I know it.  I've seen this phone before.  A lot of problems with it.  No, no.  And I know how to fix it.  Why don't you just tell Rick  to fix the phone?  All right, let me go back  and tell Rick to fix the phone.  No, no, no.  No, Anthony, no.  I'll go back.  No, no, no, no.  Ben, Stinky, come here.  Maybe I should go  and tell Rick.  I want to prove this  once and for all.  It's like a Superman episode.  Can you get Ben in here?  I mean, Rick.  I'm sorry, Rick.  Yeah, Rick?  I'll get him.  No, no, no. 
[01:06:30]  I want you to sit here  for once.  What?  Hey, Rick.  Rick, how you doing?  Yeah, what?  Can you fix the phones?  Anthony talks about...  What is it, Anthony?  You have to plug something in?  Because of the computer system  that we have hooked up with  and I know it's really good  with computers.  Yeah, see, I know  I could do this.  No, no.  Perhaps I should do it.  Scott is gone?  No, no.  I think he might be my best bet  to try and get this situation.  Why don't you fiddle with it  a little bit?  I really want Anthony talking...  Is that Ken out in the office?  No, no.  He's waving at me. 
[01:07:00]  Wait.  One second.  No, Ken...  I've got to talk to Ken Stevens.  I want to...  For a second,  but I'll be back to talk to...  Ronald Reagan.  No, I want to talk...  I want you to talk  to the former president for once.  I will.  I'll be right back  and there seems to be a problem  by the time we fix it.  I'll be done with that, Ken Stevens.  I am sick of carrying your ass  and doing all the interviews.  No, no, Anthony.  I'll be right back.  No, wait, Anthony.  No.  I'll be right back.  No.  No.  Two seconds.  I'll be right back.  Ken.  Ken Stevens.  I see Ken out there.  How are you, Ken Stevens?  All right, all right.  Well, come back in.  How much longer 
[01:07:30]  do I have to wait  for this call?  Hello?  President Reagan.  Yes.  Can you hold on a minute?  I want you to talk  to my buddy and my pal,  my partner on the radio,  Anthony.  Yes, I know Anthony.  He's a very,  very talented young man.  Even with my Alzheimer's,  I can say.  No, he's not that talented.  That man is fabulous.  No, he sucks.  He's marvelous.  You know,  it's my birthday today.  Yes, it is, sir.  Stinky.  Hold on.  Stinky.  Yes. 
[01:08:00]  Where's Anthony  as I talk to the former  president of the United States?  He's out there with Ken.  Where?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll be like two seconds.  See?  I'm right here with Ken.  What are you guys  talking about?  Wait,  the president is on the line.  I can't take this.  If I'm not,  I'm busy.  And,  well,  it's my birthday.  Sir,  we wanted to wish you  a very happy 90th birthday today,  but I want Anthony  to talk to you.  You're one of his heroes.  Yes, 
[01:08:30]  I know.  Did I say how much  I admire that man?  He's a fine American.  He's not that great.  Trust me.  And on this mind,  well,  90th birthday,  I'd like to say,  God bless Anthony.  Because he,  oh,  wait a minute,  Nancy's calling me  to open a gift.  You bastard.  You bastard.  Could you hold on  while I open a gift?  Sure,  sure.  Because it is my birthday.  All right,  I'll hold on a second.  Anthony,  we're talking to the president. 
[01:09:00]  Ken just had a little problem.  All right,  well,  he's on the line.  Talk to him.  I was talking.  Hello?  He's not here.  What do you mean?  I was just talking to him.  Where'd he go?  I don't know.  What?  Looks like you don't need  Mr. President.  Looks like you don't need  that home gym anymore.  Mr. President?  Hello?  He said he was opening up  a gift or something  for his 90th birthday.  Oh,  he is?  Yeah.  When he gets back on,  call me.  I'm just going to finish up with Ken.  What a swell gift.  No,  I know it's you now,  Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  It's you.  It's a set of golf clubs.  No,  Ant,  I am convinced.  You know,  I play one hole of golf  18 times  because they're all new to me.  Ant,  you use that line  every goddamn time  you imitate Reagan.  I know it's you now.  I don't know  what you're talking about.  I know it's you.  Don't you insult Anthony.  You bet.  That man  is a true American hero.  No,  no,  you,  Oh,  hold on.  They're cutting the cake.  It's my 90th birthday  and if I don't blow 
[01:10:00]  these candles out,  the whole place  is going to go up.  Yeah.  So hold on.  All right.  Anthony,  don't forget to  add that line  about how big  your wife's head is.  All right,  Ken,  I'm doing a show.  Holy smoke,  this guy.  Let me get it.  I'm doing a show,  Ken.  Opie,  I'm sorry.  Try to stretch it  long enough.  Ant,  I know it's you.  Everyone knows 
[01:10:30]  it's you now.  You look,  you look silly.  What a dandy cake.  Ant,  I just saw you.  You were right there.  I know the phone  that you're talking on  is like 20 feet away.  Look,  you young prankster.  Don't be saying  things like this  about my good friend,  Anthony.  I'll send  Secret Service  over there.  What are you going to do?  You won't be happy.  What are you going to do?  Oh, look,  another present.  Let me,  I'll open this one  on your show. 
[01:11:00]  Ant,  if the listeners  listen closely,  they can hear you  as Reagan  out of breath  because everyone  knows you're not in shape.  No,  I just blew out  the candles  and there were 90.  Son of a bitch.  Hold it.  Oh,  what a great gift.  It's a set of golf clubs.  I've always wanted these.  You know,  I play one hole of golf  18 times.  I know.  It's all new to me.  Yeah, exactly.  See,  that's Alzheimer's.  Anthony,  they're all waiting  for the lines  about how big  Nancy's head is.  Might as well  get it out there.  I don't remember  ever saying that. 
[01:11:30]  Now,  we're going to go play  Pin the Tail on the Democrat,  one of my favorite games.  Yeah.  Could you  please hold on?  Of course.  Now,  Anthony's going to come back  in the studio.  Opie?  Eh?  Yeah,  hi.  How you doing?  Wait,  you're not in the studio.  Where are you?  I'm sitting right in front of you,  you jerk.  You're not in front of me.  No one's going to believe...  Hello.  Hi,  it's me again, 
[01:12:00]  Ron Ray.  Son of a bitch.  Hello.  Wait,  Mr. President,  this is fabulous.  You son of a bitch.  Speaking to you  is an honor.  Well,  Anthony,  you've always been  one of the greatest Americans  on the face of this earth.  And I've got to tell you,  I don't appreciate  your friend Opie  making some kind of a wacky gag  out of the fact  that you were me or... 
[01:12:30]  Well,  I don't even know  what he was saying.  I'm incoherent myself sometimes,  but that boy...  I know,  Mr. President,  it gets a little rough  of having to deal with him  on a daily basis.  I see you!  What?  You're talking to yourself!  What are you talking about?  You're talking to yourself!  You're in front...  I see the studio.  You're here.  You're talking to yourself.  Mr. President,  I apologize for this.  It's an honor to speak to you.  Hello. 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  That boy is very rude.  And I can't believe  he would pull  some kind of shenanigans  like this  on my 90th birthday.  I just went in the studio  and saw you talking  to yourself.  What studio?  We're in the studio.  I'm sitting in front of you  talking to Ronald Reagan.  You son of a bitch.  What's wrong with that boy?  I don't know, 
[01:13:30]  Mr. President.  It's out of hand.  Well, you better fix him  because I'm not going to  stay on the phone  with him  in the same room as you.  I know.  In the same room as me,  Mr. President.  Can I continue  my birthday party now?  Yes, sir.  Yes, Mr. President.  Whatever you wish to do.  And finally,  what an honor  to talk to you.  And what an honor  to speak to you, Anthony.  Godspeed  and God bless.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And there he goes, Opie. 
[01:14:00]  You bastard.  I hate you.  I was in the studio.  I saw you  talking to yourself.  Now you're running back  into the studio.  What are you talking about?  I've been sitting here  the whole time.  I'm such a bastard.  I'm such a bastard.  You bastard.  You bastard.  What?  Sorry, I'm out of breath.  I was so nervous  talking with the president. 
[01:14:30]  That was exciting, Opie.  Finally.  Finally.  I hear next Chris Jericho  and Moon Goose McQuaid  are coming in.  And I think  that was our  who's on first bit.  Opie suffering  from Dr. Bellows disease.  You bastard.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  I don't care how. 
[01:15:00]  I don't care  if it's really you  or not.  Whatever.  But however you  just pulled that off,  that is one of the  damn funniest things  you guys have ever  done on this radio show.  I don't care if it's you  or not.  That was hilarious.  No, of course not.  Thank you, Matt.  Well, I guarantee you  Rick helped him out  on that.  I give up.  I give up.  I saw him talking  to himself.  I can't prove  that it wasn't.  This is radio.  You see?  I've got to go 
[01:15:30]  listen to myself.  I can't prove it.  But you were there  by yourself  talking to yourself?  Yes.  No one's going  to believe me now?  What?  Please.  I was speaking  from right here  in front of you  and you were trying  some wacky bit.  I think you finally  lost.  Scott, what's up?  Oh, I'm so happy  that you finally  got to talk  to the president.  I know.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you so much, Scott.  It must be an honor  to talk to the president. 
[01:16:00]  It was.  It just warmed  my heart to hear  how I know  how sick he is now.  I hate you all.  Don't hate.  Don't hate.  The president.  I left this studio.  I went down the hall  where Anthony  was doing his clever ruse.  But I went to the hall  and the genie was  Major...  You were there.  You were there.  Major Nelson.  You were there.  Genie went...  But then I saw the...  And I heard...  Carolyn.  Hey, I was wondering  if you guys could do  that little skit  on the XFL show  so maybe if we see it 
[01:16:30]  the acting would be better?  Thank you, Carolyn.  You're welcome.  Very funny.  All right.  All right.  Well, let's take a break.  Okay.  Whew.  This is pretty good.  I love obscure references.  Andrew from Jersey.  And come on.  We all know Ken is still out  on his lunch break.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  Coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bikini Softball 2.  The Return of Wow.  Jim Norton's World Tour.  Sex for Sam.  Wow stuff.  All coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WMEW.  A live.  I will.  I feel like.  I don't know. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  He's not.  All right, we've got to get to that.  Yeah, quite frankly, he's going to bore us here.  Hey, boy. 
[01:18:00]  All right, so if you're a faithful listener to the show,  Spaz, who you've kept off the radio for a while now, thank God,  he finally completed his gay play run.  How many plays were there?  Five.  Five of this play.  Yes.  We all remember the first night you said, I don't know,  you kind of had a scene where you had to lay in the bed with this guy  and he kind of put his hands through your hair. 
[01:18:30]  And as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure.  Yes.  That's the scene.  And you were supposed to be straight in this play, but I was supposed to be confused.  Confused with your sexuality.  You had one gay experience before this, and now for some reason you're in bed with this gay guy.  Is this the play or his life we're talking about?  Wait a minute.  I'm confused now.  He's supposed to seduce me in the play.  Right.  And you're in his bed.  Yeah.  No, he's in my bed. 
[01:19:00]  He comes into my room.  Oh, how did that come about?  So you have the homo field advantage.  How did that come about?  How did you invite the gay guy back to your room?  I invited him in.  See, the way this scene starts is that I'm in my bed, like, sobbing.  Like, I'm fighting not to cry because of a tragedy in my life.  And he hears that through the partition in the wall.  So he comes in and he...  Takes a temper to the old-fashioned way. 
[01:19:30]  He calms me down and he seduces me.  He uses the excuse that I want to, you know...  Yeah, it's every day that I'm in bed and if someone's knocking at the door, I just let  him in and invite him into my bed.  It's a play, you know?  No coffee or anything?  I don't invite him in because it's just, like, a little thin wall with, like, a little  slide door.  He just walks right in.  I don't...  Oh, he just came right in.  He just...  I walk into his room.  What, are you at a bathhouse or something?  Is this supposed to be your apartment?  It's supposed to be...  It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  And you're just living with gay guys.  No, one is gay.  The other one, if he gets $100, he'll do it.  And you're supposedly this confused guy.  I'm the confused guy.  So now, the gay guy's in your bed.  Do we have to talk about this?  Because I know that a lot of listeners were, like, happy about Spaz Free.  Oh, shit.  Shut up.  Okay.  So you're in the bed.  I'm in the bed.  And he's sitting on the bed with you. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  And now, he starts, the actor, starts improvising a little bit on the scene.  Yeah, let's get this straight because, basically, you all agree that, okay, you'll do this  gay scene, but there's no touching, right?  Well, there's only one part where, there's only two parts where he touches me.  One is when he runs his finger down my arm.  Right.  And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders.  And you agreed to that, but no more for this play.  Yes.  But the actor starts improvising. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  All right, Spaz.  He says, what did the actor do to you during the gay play?  Now, the first couple of nights, he started improvising just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So what was he doing then?  Well, instead of, like, a finger, he put his whole hand.  And rubbed down your, where?  He would rub down my thigh.  So he's rubbing down your thigh.  And then, what was he doing?  You said something with, I don't know, what was he doing?  Wasn't he breathing? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yes, yes.  Like, kickle in there.  He nubbed my ear.  He what?  He put his, like, he took my earlobe, like, he held on my earlobe, shook it a little.  What is he, Carol Burnett?  So he grabbed your ear?  He grabbed my earlobe, yes.  So he fingered your ear?  He didn't finger, he just grabbed down the earlobe.  So he had a hold of your, your ear, your ear.  My ear.  Yeah, that's what I said.  That's what I said, your ear.  Your ear.  So he gently fingered your ear.  Your ear, I said. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your ear.  Your ear.  Right.  My ear.  So he had his hand.  Your ear.  He had his hand all over your ear.  All over your ear.  Did he poke anything in your ear?  No.  No?  He just grabbed onto it.  He just grabbed your ear.  Yes.  And kind of flitted around with a finger.  But didn't stick anything in your ear?  Did I get to sound like my behind?  No, I'm saying your ear.  Your ear.  My ear?  Yeah.  You're from New York.  This is how we talk.  My ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Your ear.  Yeah.  We said your ear.  He fingered my ear. 
[01:22:30]  He fingered your ear.  Did he finger your ear?  He grabbed onto it.  Right.  Okay.  So, but he shook it with his fingers.  Right?  Yeah.  He kind of played with his fingers on your ear.  Yes.  On my ear, yeah.  That's what I said.  Your ear.  Yeah.  So, was he blowing into your ear?  No, he didn't get that far.  Okay.  All right.  Did he tongue your ear?  No.  I got to ask.  No.  He did not tongue anything. 
[01:23:00]  Would you consider what he did to your ear a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  It's like saying, like, here's looking at you, kid, type thing.  Would you consider it a diddle?  What do you mean, like, a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  What do you mean by that?  I don't know.  I mean, was it a diddle?  You know what a diddle is?  No, it's kind of like a diddle.  He just grabbed on all of it.  He, like, looked at me dead in the eye.  Wait, so he used two fingers?  He used two fingers.  He looked at me in the eye and he shook it a little bit.  Two fingers on your ear? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Wow, Spaz.  That's all I could say.  Okay.  So that was the first night of improvising.  Yes.  That he did.  So now the next night, he gets a little more bold with you.  Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not, but there's this part where he's supposed  to say, shh, listen to the rain.  And I'm supposed to turn my head away, look out the fake window and look at the rain. 
[01:24:00]  And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say, I'm going to give you this to help you  to sleep.  And he puts his hands underneath the sheets.  And I, I mean, he.  So he's supposed to be manually doing something.  Yeah.  But no, no, he's, no, he's supposed to, yeah, he's supposed to be like reaching for it.  Right.  But how are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear?  No, he just numbs it at the, at the end of it.  All right.  So you're listening to the rain.  Yeah, I'm listening to the rain and he's moving his head and he kind of nipped it. 
[01:24:30]  Now, now, wait a minute.  What?  He nipped your, your schlong?  Ah, fag.  It was unintentional.  I'm thinking.  Wait a minute.  I never.  Dude.  What do you mean?  No offense, but at that point, you break character.  You break character.  And you punch him in the head.  Yeah.  And you go, come on, man.  What are you doing?  I broke character in a different way.  I laughed a little bit.  Oh, you laughed?  Why?  Because you liked it?  You giggling like a bitch.  Or you giggling like a little schoolgirl?  Giggling like a bitch, man.  No. 
[01:25:00]  No.  No.  I laughed.  Finger my ear.  My ear.  I did not laugh.  No.  This is the way it happened.  You see, because I was not expecting it.  You did.  You did.  You did.  Oh, yes.  Oh.  Did he touch your unit?  He nipped the tip. 
[01:25:30]  BANG!  Now, I'm not a fag.  He touched the tip.  No, he just brushed, nipped it.  He nipped it.  So you don't even know all the terminology.  With his teeth.  Yeah.  No, not with his teeth.  All right.  And you giggle like a schoolgirl.  I didn't giggle like a schoolgirl.  How did you laugh?  Give us a little laugh.  You broke character.  What did you do?  No, I didn't laugh out loud.  I had this smile on my face.  What?  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Let me tell you something, Spaz.  Play or no play. 
[01:26:00]  Someone's touching my schlong.  Even if they nip into it, that's not the look that's on my face.  The look on my face is...  It's not a big smile.  Right.  But let me just tell you why I had that.  Because I was not expecting it.  Because he has a...  This is the private person who has a tendency to play jokes around the...  Oh, yeah.  What a joke.  But the joke's on him because you're not gay, right?  Yeah, sure.  Why don't you have the look of pure shock on your face?  Boy, that's not my...  That's how I react to everything, though.  That's how I react to everything. 
[01:26:30]  That's like my defense against, you know, like...  That's my defense against everything.  No, uncertainty or like...  But he nipped it.  The tip of it.  He nipped it.  No, laughing is my defense against something if I'm not...  Oh, yeah.  So I'm so afraid of something.  I can see you on cell block D just giggling your ass off with you while you're a new boy.  Hey!  That's good.  I'm laughing is my defense.  He's tossing my salad.  No, look, I'm tossing salad. 
[01:27:00]  It would never go that far.  It would never go that far.  Oh, sure.  So how far would it go if he nipped it?  He nipped.  I was not expecting it.  And things that I get surprised at, I laugh at.  So you laugh.  Yeah.  So now, moving on.  Right.  There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your 
[01:27:30]  intimate area.  Right.  Yes.  To simulate that he's hobbing the knob.  Pleasuring.  Yes.  Right.  So at one point, he gets so close.  Now, Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh-colored boxer shorts.  Yes.  And what was he wearing?  He was wearing the European underwear with the outline.  European underwear with the outline.  What is that?  You don't know.  It's like it's underwear with the outline.  It's a speedo.  No, it's like the shape of your thing, but it goes down to your... 
[01:28:00]  The back's like a thong.  It acts like it's speedo, yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  But it's underwear.  Yeah, sure.  So this guy's obviously gay.  No, he's not.  Please.  He's a respected man.  Well.  Wait.  Look, he's defending his boyfriend.  No, because...  Wait.  So are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected?  Yes.  No, I'm saying it's fast.  I'm saying it's like...  You're one of them.  You shouldn't put him down.  Right.  I'm not one of them.  No, what I'm saying is I cannot...  You should be a good spokesperson for your community.  I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine. 
[01:28:30]  I asked if he was gay, and you said no because he's a respected man.  Yeah, I meant no.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  People aren't respected.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  You just did.  We have a lot of everything around.  We have a lot of gay listeners.  They're going to be pissed off at you.  I already said that I could be friends with a gay person.  Oh, gee.  You pretty much batted down with one.  I hope you could be friends.  He's not gay, though.  Wow.  Don't do the gay community a favor or anything.  Oh, come on.  I could be friends with one.  But don't touch. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, sure.  Boy, gee, thanks.  So, Spaz, so now you're wearing your boxer shorts.  Mm-hmm.  And he's wearing his European little bathing suit or whatever.  Now, I guess the front of the boxers has the normal hole in it.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, as he does his little move where he moves south, he gets so close.  What do you feel?  Breath.  You feel hot, steamy man breath on your unit. 
[01:29:30]  There's a reason for that.  There's a reason for that?  There's a reason for that.  The reason for that is that that particular night, that particular night, the lights were  coming down really slow.  Oh.  Yeah.  Fake.  So, he has to stretch the scenes.  No, what he has to do, he has to hold his position there.  Yeah, hold his position.  Oh, hot, steamy man breath.  It feels weird.  Ah! 
[01:30:00]  And what about razor stubble?  What, do you think I liked it?  Not once did I get excited.  So, you laughed again, though, right?  That, no, that had a...  No, I shouldn't.  No, that...  No.  No.  No, bitch laugh.  I do not laugh like that, all right?  I've been madly laughing.  How do you laugh?  I need to be told something funny.  This stuff isn't funny?  This is hysterical.  What, are you crazy? 
[01:30:30]  No, but at that particular time, I had a look at confusion on my face because I was looking  in the direction of the lighting person.  Looking erection, what?  Oh, oh, looking at the erection.  Oh, direction.  All right, so let me get this straight.  That's French for erection.  You had a look of confusion.  Direction.  Because you were looking at the lighting director.  Yep.  And that's why you were confused?  It wasn't because there was man breath on your nose?  No, I was confused at two things.  One is...  No, actually, because the slow lighting led to the man breath. 
[01:31:00]  Hot, steamy man breath.  1-900.  But I'm...  Like I said, it probably was purely unintentional.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, he couldn't just get far enough away.  No, because look, because he had a simulator, so he had to put the blanket up and he had  his face like right there.  Was his head moving?  What?  Was his head moving?  No, not at all.  Did you have your hand on the back of his head?  No, I was...  No, because he has to tell me to lean back and imagine the paratroopers, so I have to  lean back.  What? 
[01:31:30]  Paratrooper?  Yeah, the paratrooper is...  Paratrooper was the person I had a relationship with a long time ago before we closed up.  Geronimo!  Yeah.  The pooper trooper?  Pull my cord.  Yeah.  Oh, Spaz, man.  You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma?  Oklahoma.  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:32:00]  This is an old traditional Irish song, and it's usually passed down from father to son  when the boy's on the verge of manhood.  And it's called Down to the Old Pub Instead.  Ah.  And I'd like to play it for you tonight.  Thank you.  Lad, it's your duty to find your lass with childbearing hips in a pink suplice, and make 
[01:32:30]  her your wife and lover with love so true.  Now, some rivers run high, some rivers run low.  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow, and it's called menstruation.  Here's what it means to you.  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first.  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst.  Son, don't be afraid, it's a natural thing. 
[01:33:00]  Just wad up some cotton and hand her a string, and put the old linens on top of the bed.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Hundreds of years old.  That's why bloomers.  Aye.  Aye.  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender.  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her.  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want to make love, if you do, you're a fool. 
[01:33:30]  You'll only end up with a bloody old tool.  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead.  She'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins, but son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins.  So turn off the light, and take off your hat, and drop to your knees.  Say a prayer to St. Pat, that'll give you the strength to get out of the bed.  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead.  I feel a solo coming on. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, really?  Perhaps right here, Anthony.  Very good.  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting.  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeting.  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pagan.  The pub is the place when your lady is ragging.  So drink of your pint, boys, and thank your Samrocks.  That as menfolk, we don't have to bleed from our c***. 
[01:34:30]  And that we can escape from the lady in red.  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead.  Nice.  Thank you, my lads.  Thank you so much.  Raise your glass.  Funny goods.  You did your part well.  Thank you.  Nice fluting.  Nice fluting and nice bleeping. 
[01:35:00]  I was a fluter and bleeper, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted.  And he's only pretending to be interested in who I am and what I think.  So he can get in twice a day.  Dirty girls will love too.  Opie and...  Do you know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around here?  Answer me.  Opie.  Answer me.  1027.  B-A-N-E-W. 
[01:35:30]  Nobody make it.  No one has no lie.  They will separate the money from the mine.  We're a great mind.  We wish I could be.  I wish I could be.  I wish I could be mine.  Rick, do you want wedding advice?  That was huge yesterday.  Neil, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You guys are well.  How are you doing?  Hey, good.  What's up?  Yeah, Rick around.  Yeah, Rick's here.  Hey, Rick, I got a little bit of wedding advice for you.  Okay, first I've got to ask you a question, Rick. 
[01:36:00]  Do you like pizza?  Um, okay, I'll bite, yeah.  Okay, let me ask you a question.  Do you eat pizza every night of your life?  No.  You can try to picture eating pizza every night of your life with the same pizza place.  Never, ever change it.  It's the same pizza place.  Are you going to be the pizza?  I can't order Domino's one night or anything?  Yeah, no, it's got to be the same pizza place.  All right.  It's the same pizza place.  If you want Domino's, it's going to be Domino's for the rest of your life.  All right.  It's going to be the same way. 
[01:36:30]  You're going to start, your pizza's going to be served to you.  You're going to put a little cheese on it.  I like cheese.  And it's over.  It's going to be that way the rest of your life.  Over and over and over again.  Over and over and over.  No steak.  Now that you're married.  No pork chops and apple sauce.  It's not a pizza shop.  That's what it's going to be like.  Get used to it.  All right.  Neil.  No more surprises.  Neil.  One more thing.  No more surprises when you pull down the panties.  It's all going to be the same thing. 
[01:37:00]  Thanks, guys.  Well, I hope it's the same thing.  I hope it's a vagina every single time I pull down those panties.  It's going to be the same one, though.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Thank you, Neil.  How long have you been miserable, Neil?  His wife cut him off.  Jonathan, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing today?  My brother-in-law is getting married on Sunday.  I sent him some very perfect email the other day.  Marriage is the sex as rain is the baseball.  Good luck. 
[01:37:30]  Pull the tarps over the field and wait it out.  Thanks, Jonathan.  Well, this is always fun when this happens.  I got pounded with emails yesterday.  Yeah.  Most of them were the people that tried to get through that Spaz hung up on.  Yeah.  Thanks, Spaz.  That are saying, oh, it's not that bad.  I've been married, you know, blah, blah, blah.  So.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, I got good advice for Rick.  He's a real man.  Yeah.  He's going to tell his wife. 
[01:38:00]  He's going to get the last word.  He's going to say, yes, dear.  That's right.  It only gets worse, buddy.  Only gets worse.  You see, this isn't unusual.  When someone's getting married, you know, everyone tries to talk the guy out of it.  Right.  It's been happening through the ages.  Years, of course.  The family members all get around and the married ones and tell you how much it sucks.  And then the wife of the married guy that's telling you this starts beating him over the  head.  No, shut up.  It doesn't suck. 
[01:38:30]  It's great.  Julie, what's up?  Does Rick trust his wife?  Wait, say that again.  Does Rick trust his fiancee?  Oh, I thought you said toss.  No.  What does that mean?  Do I trust her?  Trust her.  Yes, I do.  Does she trust you?  Yes.  Then you guys should have a pretty good relationship, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's all about trust.  Well, let me tell you.  It's awesome.  I'm a newlywed, fairly newlywed.  I've been with my husband, we've been living together for like two years, two and a half 
[01:39:00]  years.  We've been married for two months.  We totally trust one another.  I can do pretty much whatever I want as long as I tell him where I'm going and when I'm  coming home.  And he can do the same because I trust him and I know he just wants to be with me.  Our marriage is fantastic.  We have an awesome, awesome relationship.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And Rick, you're doing the right thing.  If you guys trust each other and love each other, you'll probably be happy the rest of your  life.  Isn't this guy deaf?  Wow.  Thank you, Julie. 
[01:39:30]  Yep.  All right, bye.  Let's try Bubba again.  Bubba.  Barbara.  No, it's you.  Bubba, right?  Her name's Barbara.  He wrote Bubba.  Oh, Spaz wrote Bubba.  Barbara.  Your name's Barbara?  Barbara.  Yeah, he wrote Bubba.  He wrote Bubba.  So what's going on?  Fire that secretary.  That's great.  So what's up?  Well, anyway, I'm a newlywed.  I've only been married for three months.  And I have to tell you, it's good and bad.  If you don't have a child yet, enjoy yourself. 
[01:40:00]  Once you have a child, things change.  And it's not just the woman that does it.  20 pounds of energy runs your life for the rest of your life.  And there's not a beeper or a cell phone or anything else you can complain about that isn't going to be beat by a two-year-old.  There goes your sex life.  There goes your free time.  There goes your wife taking a shower more than twice a week.  And sex?  Don't even talk about sex.  You look at each other at night.  And if you have a choice between watching Oz or something on TV, you're going to do that rather than have sex because it just takes too much energy. 
[01:40:30]  So if you're a newlywed without a child, go for it and get it all in now because that's the end.  Get out now!  Get out now!  Get out now!  Listen to him.  Rick, get out now!  What does she have, him shackled at home?  He's yelling, Rick, get out now.  She's got a happy marriage because she's got him tied up and bound in another room.  He's cooking my dinner and he's keeping my daughter dinner.  Oh, very good.  I got him trained.  Well, thank you, Barbara. 
[01:41:00]  And very good luck to you, Rick.  All right.  Thanks.  Very good.  She goes, Barbara, a.k.a. Bubba.  Mark, what's up?  Jesus Christ.  Mark.  Yeah, I want to talk to Rick.  All right, he's here.  Yeah, what's up, Mark?  Good luck, my friend.  Thanks.  You're going to need it.  Why?  He's speaking from experience?  Yeah, the three years that you've known each other.  Right.  Throw it right out the window, which is what I do.  It all changes.  The sweetness is gone. 
[01:41:30]  The niceness is gone.  You're done.  Throw yourself out the window.  You guys high up?  Ten flights.  Get yourself right out.  Save yourself about 40 years of trouble.  Thank you, Mark.  Good luck, Rick.  Thanks, Mark.  Very good.  Boy, this is fun, isn't it?  Well, Hector, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I want to talk to Rick about getting married, man.  All right, Rick?  Yo, man, there's three rings of wedding, man.  You got the engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering. 
[01:42:00]  Don't do it, bro.  All right, thanks.  All right, man.  Don't do it.  All right, Hector.  All right.  Bye.  Hector, like I'm going to take advice from that guy.  Why?  It's one of your brethren.  It's one of your own, man.  Aren't you a proud Puerto Rican?  Eh, to a point.  Oh.  You don't want to know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wow.  I don't know about me.  Would you like to share about your race today, Rick?  You should hear them.  They're much like the Asian.  You're self-loathing. 
[01:42:30]  Much like the Asian.  Oh, yes.  They tend to reproduce quite rapidly.  Whoa.  Listen to this racist stereotype.  No, I'm telling the truth.  Really?  My father.  Ugh, I hate the guy.  But he's the oldest of 46 kids.  Come on.  Shut up.  I'm serious.  He's 46 kids.  He told this story once on, what stupid talk show did you tell this story on where the whole  family hated you for years?  You went on a talk show?  Yeah, Rick was trying to be an actor and stuff. 
[01:43:00]  What did you go, Ricky Lake or something?  No, no, no.  It was the, who was the black chick?  Luanda.  Rolanda.  Rolanda.  Rolanda, right.  He was on Rolanda, and this is the story he told.  Rick, why don't you come out here?  Right.  What was her topic that day?  Guys who couldn't stay faithful.  Right, okay.  So then they get some dopey music, and Rick comes out.  And so I was called along with like 10 other guys, you know, through the agency or whatever,  to sit and fill seats in the audience and help spur the conversation if there was a lull. 
[01:43:30]  So they're like, you know, not many people are speaking up, so they're looking to us like,  okay, can you guys come up with something?  I was like, all right, I got something on this.  You know, so there's this one guy who's a, what do you call it, black guy, sitting up  on stage, and he's got his hat on, you know, trying to disguise himself in his dark sunglasses,  and he goes, man, it's in the jeans.  That's what it is.  It's in the jeans.  I can't help it.  And I was like, I was trying to agree with him, because, you know, being of Puerto Rican  descent, I can see, you know, through all the guys in my family, they're out banging. 
[01:44:00]  They're married, they got four or five girlfriends, they got four or five wives, but they're still  out banging.  Four or five wives?  Yeah, I'm serious.  You think I'm joking.  Jesus.  They're freaks.  So you told the whole national audience that your dad is one of 46 kids.  Right.  46?  Yeah, he was the oldest, too.  How many kids did he have?  That's impossible.  How many does he have now?  Seven, eight, something like that. 
[01:44:30]  What are you counting?  Did one just come out?  I don't know.  Seven, oh, eight.  I stopped counting about ten years ago when he hit seven, so.  Wow.  How is it possible that he's one of 46, though?  Four or five actual wives, four or five girlfriends that they know of that he'd gotten pregnant a  few times.  This is documented?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What else did you say on that show, Rick?  Yeah, what else did you say on that show?  What do you mean?  What else did you say? 
[01:45:00]  I'll get the tape.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that would be good, man.  What else did you say?  And bring the tape in Tuesday.  What did I say?  Something about how faithful.  Oh, come on.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  This was like five years ago.  Okay.  Listen to this.  Is it like the gay crowd?  This was even before the crowd.  Okay.  Listen to this.  Rick getting married in four weeks, one day.  Go ahead, Rick.  Tell everyone.  Because the guy said that it was in the genes, I was agreeing with him. 
[01:45:30]  I said, because, you know, my family, blah, blah, blah.  It could be genetic.  And I just don't want that to happen to me if I ever get married.  That's all I said.  Uh-uh.  Yes, it is.  I was like, uh-uh.  It is what I said.  You never saw the tape.  What the hell are you talking about?  What else is there?  What else is there?  I saw the tape.  When?  You were talking about how you didn't think you could be faithful or stay with one woman.  Oh, did you say that?  Something like that because it was in your genes.  Really?  That's just what I just said.  What are you talking about?  It's the trick, keeping it in your genes. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Bring the tape in.  If I have the tape, I'll bring it in.  You have the tape.  Shut up.  You have the tape.  If I have the tape, I'll bring it in.  I guarantee you have the tape.  So you're saying, as a Puerto Rican man, that Puerto Ricans reproduce more than other races?  More than you white guys, yeah.  They're up there with the Italians.  That's a real statement.  They're up there with the Italians.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a bold little statement. 
[01:46:30]  But the Asians, I guess, rule.  Asians, really?  Right?  And then I guess the Spanish, the Latin types.  Uh-huh.  You know, you get, all right, all that crap.  It's just going off, man.  You're crazy.  It's going nuts.  Bring the tape in.  I know you have it.  Yeah, we got it.  We got to hear this tape.  I know you have it.  Rolanda, huh?  Rolanda.  Circa 1994, I believe.  I'll find it.  You have to.  I'll find it.  It was like five years ago, right?  What are you crazy going on one of those shows?  They paid me, dude. 
[01:47:00]  Who cares?  They paid me.  They got me a limo to come in.  And I was going to see you.  What the effing do?  He embarrassed his whole family.  Were they pissed at you?  This is really a bad subject in his family.  Were they really pissed?  I don't know.  Were they?  Oh, man.  Everyone was pissed.  You went on national TV and said your dad was one of 46 kids.  Well, he is.  Am I supposed to lie?  Say he's a great guy.  You never, you know, my grandfather wasn't his walking sperm bank or whatever.  I don't know.  You didn't have to tell a whole national audience, though. 
[01:47:30]  Jeez.  All right.  I ain't doing it.  All right.  Let's take a quick break, Ant.  Make sure you say that.  Coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Bikini Softball 2.  The Return of Wow.  Keith Norton's World Tour.  Sex for Sam.  Wow stuff.  All coming this spring.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:48:00]  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, I'm here.  Hey, Owen.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Two things.  First thing for Rick.  You lock on your marriage.  Just think of taking a hot poster and running it through your eyes. 
[01:48:30]  That's what your first marriage was like.  That's what your first marriage was like?  Yes.  And I was stupid enough to go and do it again.  Cool.  Richie, what's up?  I hate that we have this name, Crap, which is an average thing, but let me tell you something.  Who are these listeners?  Your listeners.  Who are they married?  The mutants?  Well, I don't understand this.  I'm married.  Puerto Rican woman.  I'm Cuban.  I'm the pissed off Cuban that calls every time you play that.  It's a stupid song, by the way.  It's not a Cuban refugee song. 
[01:49:00]  It's a Cuban refugee.  We're going to end the show with that today, now that you said that.  I love that song.  Let me tell you.  That's all.  I love that song.  You shouldn't play that song, Ope.  You know why?  Because you don't have any cojones.  Anybody who gives their wallet to a guy a black guy for a dollar, forget about it.  You've got to go to the gym and get some testosterone going.  No, it was a white guy, first of all.  It was a white guy?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You better check yourself out, Ope.  It's like even worse, he's thinking.  Oh, all right.  You better check yourself out, man.  So, to be honest with you, I guess we've got to confess that, you know, Rick getting married  in four weeks, we thought it would be fun to just put through all the calls from people  that are miserable. 
[01:49:30]  Rick, it's not listening.  There are people out there that are happily married and have figured out how to make it  work, but that's not fun radio.  We put through, like, a hundred people that hate their spouse.  These guys are zombies, man.  Yeah, it's great to hear the guys are like, Rick, don't do it.  There was that one guy, Rick.  It's been three years, I'm in hell.  It's better than, and it's wonderful, and we do things, and we, you know, who wants to  hear that?  No, you know what it is?  It gets better.  You know why?  Because the sex gets better.  Because you get more inventive along the way. 
[01:50:00]  That's the first I heard that.  Absolutely.  Absolutely, man.  You know, you get a little daring as it goes along.  You know, your first couple of months with a new woman, you don't, you know, you  don't pop out the pornos or anything like that, you know.  Right.  It takes time.  It takes time, but it gets better.  Like you're making the pornos.  Yeah, exactly.  There you go.  See, yeah, and in the ten years, you're watching him again.  Look at how good I used to do this.  See, Richie, that's why we only put through the miserable people, because no one wants to  hear this.  I don't want to hear this.  They want to hear Rick getting pounded by guys that hate their lives. 
[01:50:30]  Well, you know what?  He's Puerto Rican.  My wife's Puerto Rican.  I have to stick up for the man.  All right, Richie.  Thank you.  All right.  Good luck, man.  Go Cubans, go.  Lisa, what's up?  Yesterday, you said with Rick and his fiancée that no sex for four weeks?  Yeah.  Now, some guy called and said that's probably because Rick's fiancée is a little bit easy.  I had the same deal going with my husband before he got married.  The only reason being, you wanted a little bit more special after you'd be together for  so long.  You know, so you think if you hold off for a little while, maybe once you get together, 
[01:51:00]  it'll be a little bit more special.  That's the only reason.  So the next time I have sex, it's going to be real special.  You know, maybe try a few new tricks.  Maybe that's what your fiancée's hoping for.  At this point, it's going to feel like a virgin.  Well, we had originally said four weeks, then it came down to about a week and a half.  All right, Lisa.  I don't think four weeks is going to stick.  Hey, thank you.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  All right, Rick, what's up?  A lot of Ricks and Rickies checking in today. 
[01:51:30]  Rick?  Yeah?  What's up?  Oh, you want to hear about a marriage?  This guy's beating.  Ah.  Rick, I'm going to tell you my first marriage.  My first marriage, I married somebody that I dated for five years, thought I knew them  100%.  Right.  We get an apartment, we get together.  She's like a junkyard.  Everything all over the place.  You got cereal boxes on the couch, the whole bit.  Then one day, our maid of honor comes over to the house when she's away, tries to offer  herself to me.  Me being a good husband, no, no, can't do it, you know, thank you anyway. 
[01:52:00]  So, what happens?  Seven years later, she wakes up one morning, I don't want to be married anymore, that's  it.  So then I get married a second time, and so far things aren't too bad, but I'll tell you  something, never watch the childbirth, man, because that'll ruin your sex life as far as  the fun stuff.  Are you going to bang the maid of honor this time?  There was none this time.  All right, Rick.  Damn, I'd go through the entire wedding party, gas. 
[01:52:30]  Steve, what's up?  That's my second or third time around, forget it.  Hey.  Hey.  You guys suck.  Thanks.  I would say marriage sucks, but that puts it in the same category as you guys.  I got married June 21st.  I keep thinking it'll change, you know?  It's like, I was a real jerk this time, I told her how irresponsible I was.  I told her I live an alternative lifestyle, and she says, oh yeah, yeah, that makes you  more endearing to me, I love you anyway.  Well, it always changed.  The minute they're married to you, they start trying to change you, put you into soup, a 
[01:53:00]  collar, all that stuff.  Just this last week, it was going pretty good up until a week ago.  So I sell my old Harley, which I love dearly, to buy a new 1999 one.  I make $2,500 on the deal.  I give her two grand, you know?  So she calls me up today, I'm balancing the checkbook, and she says, how much money do  we got?  I say, $382.  She says, where the hell did the rest of the money go to?  I said, I gave you two grand.  And so she says, from now on, I'm handling all the money.  And I said, baby, you know what the difference is between a Harley and you? 
[01:53:30]  I can always sell the Harley once.  So, you know, it's like, as far as I'm concerned, you know, the good thing and the bad thing  about marriage is, the good thing is, you sleep with a woman every night, the bad thing  is, you got blue balls and it's the same woman.  All right.  Wow.  This guy's miserable.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right.  And you guys suck.  All right.  I love WOW.  I'm a truck driver.  Well, WOW has become, whip them out whenever, because the summer's just about over. 
[01:54:00]  So, have fun out there, all right?  I'm trying to make it out tonight.  All right.  Long weekend.  Everyone should get their WOWs on their ride.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, hello.  Open ending?  Yeah.  Hey, this is Steve.  You guys suck?  Hey, does Rick still want to get married?  Yeah, Rick.  Yep, still wants to.  Tell Rick, it's like being castrated.  By taking your dog to get fixed, you can forget about it.  You know what I'm saying?  You can forget about being happy.  You can forget about being sad.  Just be miserable. 
[01:54:30]  I'm married seven years.  You know what I'm saying?  Seven years.  It's a hoe.  I'm thinking of ways of hiding her body.  Oh, my God.  That's what I'm doing right now.  I'm driving on the highway.  I'm driving her deacon right now looking for a hoe to stick to the body right now when I get home.  Holy cow.  Every night.  I work seven days a week, so I have to stay home with that bitch.  Okay?  That's what it's going to be like.  And kids, forget about the little mongrels. 
[01:55:00]  Because when they get the divorce, they get everything.  Wow.  You know what I'm saying?  So it's worked out well for you.  It sounds great.  It's worked out well.  There's one more day above ground I'm happy for.  Thank you.  Okay, guys.  You guys suck?  All right.  Rick, don't do it.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Don't do it.  He's still screaming after that.  He's looking for a hole.  All right.  I think we have a happy person here.  Bob, what's up?  Hey.  Is this Rick?  It's Ope, Ann, and Rick. 
[01:55:30]  Go ahead.  Ope, Ann.  Okay, quick.  I got one thing to say to you, buddy.  Driver's side airbags.  Get yourself a car and a good insurance company, drive inside airbags.  Then what?  Then you hit a wall.  Let me tell you guys something.  14 years, about a couple of years ago, I went a whole year without getting laid by my wife.  Wow.  Whoa.  A year.  Wow. 
[01:56:00]  Okay, it was about after two kids.  Right.  Ten years of marriage.  And he's about to say, and it was the best year of my relationship.  All right, listen.  You guys suck, man.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Thanks, Bob.  I don't know.  These calls are too good.  We're in bonus show now.  Don, what's up?  Dominic.  Yeah, this is Dominic.  Oh, Dominic.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah, man.  When I got engaged, the anal stopped.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, it was great.  And then I thought I was in love, and then the anal stopped, and now it's about 50%. 
[01:56:30]  I don't know what to do.  I'm not even married yet, and it's stopping.  All right.  Thank you, Dom.  Jesus.  I'm very disappointed.  Yeah.  He needs his anal.  Dennis, what's up?  James Conn said it's the best.  Marriage is like a tornado.  You get tossed around in the beginning, and next thing you know, you lose your house. 
[01:57:00]  Loses.  You suck.  All right.  Thanks, Dennis.  Key to great marriage.  Jim.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Let's do what I did.  You get a girlfriend, you bang up before you go home.  That's all.  The sex is always great.  You'll never have a problem.  Take care, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  The show goes on.  At least you're getting solutions now.  Yeah, I guess so.  This guy has the answer to marriage. 
[01:57:30]  Maybe we'll end with this call here.  LJ.  Hey, Rick.  I just got married, and I tell you one thing you've got to buy.  What's that?  You've got to get yourself a brand new tree chipper.  That way she gives you any trouble.  You take her down to the dock.  You turn her into chump.  No evidence.  The fish eat everything.  They find anything.  She got attacked by a shark.  Remember that guy that did that upstate?  Yeah.  It's like the perfect crime, and they found a fingernail or something.  Turned him in.  I got it all planned.  All right, LJ. 
[01:58:00]  Take her close to the beach.  Put him on the beach.  You put her car in the parking lot at Jones Beach.  The next day, you're crying on the TV.  My poor wife, she went swimming.  She never came back.  I don't know what happened.  She's crying on the TV.  You get everything.  Don't have to worry about the judge taking half your Harley, half your cars.  Right, right.  Excuse me, sir.  You don't even need the wood chip.  You just couple of drinks and tell her to go swimming.  I get it all. 
[01:58:30]  Every quart lube is mine.  You give her a little too much tranya and tell her to go swimming.  Try to marry.  It's not bad for the first couple of months.  All right, LJ.  All right.  How's it going, guys?  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Crying on the TV.  Oh, God.  You guys, I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Rick's sex life is over. 
[01:59:00]  Rick will find something new every day.  Marriage is bad.  Marriage is bad.  Tailgate party at the Million Youth March.  Kevin.  How you doing, Copernac?  Listen, guys, don't make any plans Saturday morning.  We're going to have a nice tailgate party at the Million Youth March, all right?  I got a couple of extra vests and some blocks I could lend you.  You know, we'll take out the 50-gallon, half-50-gallon drum barbecue, crack it out in a truck,  and we'll, you know, we'll have a grill, make it a day.  Pop off a few rounds, it'll be good. 
[01:59:30]  Bring the wives, bring the grill for the time.  We'll have a good time.  You know?  Throw some s*** at the cops, we'll have some fun.  You can't say that.  You can't say that word.  That's the ass word.  All right, guys.  Very good.  You guys suck.  God damn, you guys are funny.  Hey, you guys are freaking funny today, man.  That ought to be the line of the day, the Million Perp March.  Oh, man.  You could crack open the barbecue.  We'll fire off some rounds. 
[02:00:00]  Imagine how fast you'd get pummeled.  You just set up a barbecue with a Go Jets banner.  What?  What?  I thought I was doing some tailgating.  Why is everyone beating me up?  Go cops.  Right.  Yeah, Go Cops banner.  Go Cops.  Opie.  Oh, God damn it. 
[02:00:30]  No!  No!  Son of a bitch!  No!  Oh, God damn it.  No!  Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Opie and Anthony.  I'm a mental case.  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to Rick's bachelor party. 
[02:01:00]  We pretty much discussed the ride over there, and we discussed how, when I pulled out my 
[02:01:30]  wad of money, the girls attacked me like they were seagulls at the beach going for a  crust of bread.  That is the way to describe it, man.  Yeah.  You pulled that out, and woof.  And Rick was late, so Earl got all the lap dances.  Well, Earl's the one, I think, you seem to be the most uptight about the whole thing,  Earl.  Oh.  When, when, well, you know, let me be honest, you were, you know, when that one first girl  wanted to take you to the VIP lounge in the back, you were resisted at first. 
[02:02:00]  You were sitting in the chair going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't want  to lap dance, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're a silly rabbit.  And I just thought that honor should have went to him.  Well, he wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  It would have, but he was not there.  And he wasn't showing up for another hour and a half at that point.  So it was just like, hey, you know, give it to Earl.  I just thought it was funny.  It was like, okay, who's going to be the first guy?  And everyone just turned around and pointed their finger straight at me. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, you are the virgin.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  You got it.  You got to give it to Earl.  There's no bell being rung there.  Ring the bell.  That's not inappropriate.  I'm just in a dry spell.  That's it.  29 years.  You got tumbleweeds rolling around in your crotch.  That dry spell.  Well, yeah, Earl got, I think, a lap dance every three minutes for the whole evening. 
[02:03:00]  Everybody was just, you know, because you're talking and stuff.  Sometimes the lap dance gets in the way.  Yeah.  I'd rather watch someone else get in the lap dance.  Put it this way, Nunzio completely hooked us up with funny money and stuff.  Yeah.  And that was supposed to be for Rick, but because Rick was late, we used it on Earl.  Yeah.  So by the time Rick the bachelor showed up, we were running out of funds quickly.  And the lap dance is just an odd thing, you know?  There's no touching. 
[02:03:30]  So you just kind of sit in the chair with your arms on the armrests as this chick is going around you  and gyrating in front of you and looking at you like you should be pounding her, you know?  But it's like, I will just stay completely still in this chair as you circle me, you know?  Yeah.  It's like when you used to play a stupid game with, like, your siblings.  I'm not touching you.  Look, I'm not touching you.  I'm not touching you.  And, like, you're right next to the person. 
[02:04:00]  You put your hand, like, right next to their face.  Why?  Why are you mad?  I'm not even touching you.  I'm not touching you.  That's how it is.  Yeah.  They get, like, right next to you.  It's the adult version of that game.  Yes.  My ass is not touching you.  My ass is not touching your nose.  All right.  So then I guess...  The VIP room was great.  Yeah, the VIP...  You don't talk about the VIP room, Earl.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ixnay on the VIP room.  Just say it was great.  You sit down, Danny. 
[02:04:30]  How about a lap dance?  So we were treated like kings at Goldfingers, and then finally the night came to an end for most of us.  Yeah, I guess, uh, boy, pretty much everyone left after a while.  Except for one guy.  I decided, uh, that there was no way in hell I could go home, Anthony.  With the smells and the things that were hanging off my clothes, it would be safe to stay away from home. 
[02:05:00]  You'd just end up smelling like, uh, like...  Dancer.  Oh, man.  Right.  Like, uh...  Like I said earlier, there were substances on my body that I could not recognize, and I felt it was safe to stay away from the homestead.  Because I wasn't functioning right where I could explain some of this stuff.  So I decided to crash at Ben's place, and my clothes, by the way, have, uh, officially been burned. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Now, did your pants look like, um, well, they look like you dropped some sour cream on there?  No, no, no, no.  Not that bad.  Out of the fajitas?  No, not that bad.  But first of all, I guess, um, Mark, Psycho Mark, who's in the studio, he started getting really pissed at everyone.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't go there.  Don't go there?  Yeah.  Well, you're a friggin' loony with those dancers, man. 
[02:06:00]  That was part of the best part of the show.  You know what?  Guys can relate to this.  There's always one guy in the crew.  There's always one guy in the crew that is convinced that the girl actually likes him.  And you'll be going home to bang the dancer.  Right.  That person in our gang is...  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Hello.  Who at one point, I think, had, um, too many dollars in both hands. 
[02:06:30]  Uh, did I see a shoe-off with more dollars between your toes?  You were shaking money around, like, Trump.  Sitting front row.  You were, like, right there next to the stage.  And, uh, a girl would come over and give him a lap dance.  And he's getting into...  Like, his arms are going and he's almost dancing with the girl.  Correct.  I was having a good time.  Well, sure.  It was great.  I'm not wrong with that.  Is it true you were thinking you had a shot at that girl? 
[02:07:00]  No, of course not.  Oh, now he says it.  What time did you get home?  Oh, like 3.30.  Let me stress...  Let me make it perfectly clear.  We started the festivities around 8.15.  It wasn't like we went out at 11, because most guys are like,  Oh, what's the big deal?  Four hours in the club?  No big deal.  No.  No, we're talking 8 hours in the club for Mark.  It's a hard day's work.  To the point where you're punching your pal Ben over there.  Well, Ben deserved the punch, but we'll get to that in a little bit.  Well, we can get to it now, because it all relates. 
[02:07:30]  Now, Ben has an apartment in the village, right?  Lower East Side.  Bay.  Jeez.  Near NYU and all that.  And Ben has a really small place.  Correct, Mark?  You've stayed there?  Yes, I have.  When you first moved to the city?  Now, I asked Ben if I could crash on his couch,  because there's no way, like I said earlier, there's no way I could go home.  Right.  There was a slight problem with that.  Ben told me, yeah, no problem.  And that's the truth.  I thought everything was cool.  I found out when I arrived at Ben's place that there was already another guy staying there, 
[02:08:00]  another one of his friends, that is moving to New York City.  See, Ben has all these friends, Ant, and they all move to New York City,  but they start their journey in New York by staying with Ben for a month, right?  Is that true?  Totally right.  So who is this guy?  It's Ed.  Drunk Ed.  Drunk German Ed.  Drunk German Ed.  With a bullet hole in his head.  Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  I guess this would be a great time to introduce Drunk German Ed to the show.  Who wants to tell the story of why he has a bullet? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, he was in the mark in his head.  He was in the German Army, and I think they were doing exercises with the Russians,  and he stuck his head up from behind a berm and got whacked with a 7.62 round in his head.  And the rumor is he was drunk when he was on duty, and he was, oh, what's on the other side?  Whoop, whack, whack.  And he got shot with live ammo in the head during training.  Exercise.  It's a true story.  He's got a dent in his head, Ed. 
[02:09:00]  That's why they call him Drunk German Ed.  German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  Pretty much wraps it up right there, doesn't it?  There you go.  True story.  So I go to Ben's, assuming, you know, it's going to be no problem.  We're going to just, you know, crash.  I got the couch, Ben's got his bed, tiny little apartment, no bigger than this studio we're in right now.  But there's Drunk Ed on Ben's couch.  With a 40.  With a 40 of Bex.  So, Ben, what did you say to Ed?  Well, I told him to go stay at Mark's. 
[02:09:30]  At like a quarter to one, he tells his guest, Ed.  Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  That he has got to leave his apartment.  Because I'm crashing there.  Oh, what a nice guy.  Now I'm feeling uncomfortable.  I'm like, Ben, didn't you, like, work this out before you told me I could stay?  Hmm.  Guess not.  So Ed, all drunk and belligerent, gets up and goes to Mark's. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but you missed the whole point, Bill.  There's a bunch of points here, Mark.  Now, Mark didn't want Drunk Ed at his place because he was convinced that he was taking one of the strippers from Goldfinger's home.  That is the truth.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  You're absolutely wrong.  That's not the reason why I wanted Ed.  You know your little honey's listening, but that is the truth.  You thought you were getting lucky.  Maybe I did.  You guys don't even know about it.  All right, so now Ben just flat out kicks his friend out on the street at 1230 at night. 
[02:10:30]  And all I remember is Drunk Ed going, you don't kick a black man out on the street at 1230 at night?  Oh.  Well, you forgot to mention it.  Ed is also black.  Yeah.  A black German.  He's a black German with a bullet hole in his head.  So now where does the story go?  Well, then he went to Mark's building.  Well, wait a minute.  Before he even gets to the building, you were at the club, right? 
[02:11:00]  You're like, oh, I hope he's going to stay with me.  He's going to stay over at the place tonight.  So Ed's going to stay with you.  And I'm like, Ed is not staying at my apartment.  There is no way that Ed is staying with me.  I already told you that Ed cannot stay at my apartment.  Now, logically, it would have been like, logically, it would have been okay if I would have just, like, stayed at your place.  But, see, you live with a gay guy.  And I had a problem with that.  So I said, I'll go and live.  I'll go stay with Ben.  Yes, and I'm just saying. 
[02:11:30]  And the gay roommate doesn't want drunk German Ed with the bullet hole in his head staying at your house either.  Last time Ed came over, he almost broke all the furniture and he insulted my roommate.  What did he say?  He said something to the fact where he says, I hate the Jews and my roommate is Jewish.  Isn't that amazing?  Even black Germans hate the Jews?  You'd think they would understand, like, oppression and stuff.  But my poor roommate, you know, being the way he is, got very offended. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  And was very upset.  And then Ed proceeds to blow a nasty, stinky beer fart in the apartment.  And, you know, like, how those gay guys like to keep their apartment so nice and neat and stuff and smelling good.  So, needless to say, it left a bad taste in my roommate's mouth.  So Ed is no longer allowed in my apartment.  That's not the first thing.  So, drunk Ed goes to Mark's.  Problem is, Mark's not home because, let's go back to the story, he's still trying to pick up the stripper. 
[02:12:30]  Goldfinger.  I was hanging out with Nunzio.  Nunzio.  Nunzio is very cool.  Nunzio is the man.  So, drunk Ed stayed in your lobby for how long?  Like, three hours.  Not kidding.  Three hours in the lobby of your building.  And he's waiting for Mark to get home.  Right.  So he could stay with him.  So he could sleep.  Right.  So, meanwhile, he's sitting in the lobby of my building, bothering the poor doorman.  Just, like, making erratic conversation with the poor guy. 
[02:13:00]  And trying to explain his plight as a black German stuck out in the city.  With a bullet hole in his head.  Right.  So, I walk in, this is like 3.30, and all of a sudden, I'm, you know, I'm tired, I'm ready to go up to bed.  Right.  I look.  Hey, Mark, it's Ed, how are you?  I'm like, what the hell are you doing here?  Hey, I'll be staying over at Ben's house, and they threw me out on the street.  And I'm like, you've got to be kidding me. 
[02:13:30]  He did throw him out on the street.  Oh, Ben, man.  Ben flat out said, Ben.  Ben flat out said, drunk Ed, you have to leave.  So, Ed comes over to my place to stay.  I don't have a place.  And I told Ed, I said, Ed, you can't stay here.  You cannot stay here.  So, I ended up loaning him, like, another, like, $100, $200 to go get a hotel room.  At 3 o'clock in the morning?  3.30?  Well, if my roommate woke up and saw a black guy sleeping on the couch, the place with a bullet hole in his head, it would not be a pretty sight. 
[02:14:00]  The gay guy, let me get this straight, the gay guy doesn't like the black German guy with a bullet hole in his head.  And likewise, the black German guy doesn't like the Jews, which the gay guy takes offense to.  Is he Jewish?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Well, now it makes perfect sense.  He's very Jewish.  And Ed's claiming that when Ben kicked him out of his apartment that we were mocking him and laughing at him.  Yeah, well, he told me, he goes, oh, Ben, and Ben was laughing at me when he threw me out of the apartment. 
[02:14:30]  I had no place to go.  Oh, he threw me out of the street.  Mark, you got to have me play to stay in a place.  And he's still drunk out of his mouth, slurring his words.  So, anyhow, I get him to leave.  And the doorman is like, who the hell was that guy?  He spent the last three hours trying to, you know, converse with me about his bullet hole in his head and people throwing him out in the street. 
[02:15:00]  But, Ben, that was probably the coldest thing I've ever heard in a long time.  That was pretty cold to put your own friend out in the street.  I mean, you could have let him stay, you know, in a corner, for Christ's sake.  I know, you're right.  Now, looking back on it, you're right.  Oh, oh, now?  Oh, see, this morning you're like, oh, it was so funny.  I was standing here by me.  He did it!  That's how it went down.  Not nice.  And you're laughing, too, Opie.  Yeah, Opie.  You were laughing.  I think Opie's part of the problem, too. 
[02:15:30]  Like, you didn't say anything like, did you say anything to Ben like, oh, Ben, you can't do that, man.  Look, I'll make other arrangements.  Hey, look, man, I was tired.  Screw the guy with the bullet hole in his head.  I'm tired.  I was tired.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, I love being an Irishman.  I drink all day long. 
[02:16:00]  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I love to eat up Arabs and niggers' raps and shoes.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  Everyone knows the Irish are as dumb as they can be.  They drive their car to the local bar and they always have to pee.  We all know that a toilet is a Mickey's favorite room.  So grab me two potatoes and I'll whistle you a tune.  Oh, I love being an Irishman. 
[02:16:30]  I drink all day long.  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I like to eat up Arabs and niggers' raps and Jews.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  We all know that a Mickey likes to scrap and fight.  They'll take it to the finish, ere they be wrong or right.  Me mother was a boxer.  Me father was a drunk.  And what could be worse than the Irish? 
[02:17:00]  Curse me wee bit little junk.  Oh, I love being an Irishman.  I drink all day long.  I look just like a bulldog with a tiny little schlong.  I like to eat up Arabs and niggers' raps and Jews.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  And if you're queer, I'll finish my beer and beat the hell out of you.  Oh, I'm the sweetheart. 
[02:17:30]  And Anthony.  That's the A-hole over there.  You C-sucking F.  Cool jack-off ass F.  The Hopi and Anthony Show.  Yeah, that's funny.  Hopi and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Show me what it's for.  Make me understand it.  I've been trying to get better.  Looking for the answer.  Is there something more than what I've been handed? 
[02:18:00]  I've been crawling in the dark.  Looking for the answer.  Stockbroker Dave in the studio.  We were supposed to play Winstockbroker Dave's Money.  Dave's telling us he's got to go.  He's got to go to the Met game.  Mets Braves.  Mets Braves, of course.  Uh-huh.  It's wrong.  Now, what's the real reason that you're leaving? 
[02:18:30]  God, it's going to take an hour to get there.  You're such a liar.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How long did it work today?  You're such a liar.  Let's make sure the monitors are fine.  You weren't happy with the talent.  Why do you got to do this?  What?  The monitors look nice and loud?  It's off?  Oh, no.  All right.  God.  What is that?  It's my great-great-grandmother.  Is that the one that ate the piece of my sack for the Aerosmith ticket? 
[02:19:00]  I don't know.  So, the reason we're not this girl, it showed up.  She's a pig.  It's so hip.  Venus.  No, she's a beast.  It's so complete.  She's a beast.  She's a beast, I tell you.  You know, you show off for money on this program.  This is all we could get to win Steinbroker Dave's money?  This show is so goddamn pathetic.  You know, if you're a faithful listener to this show, don't bother anymore.  There's nothing to see here. 
[02:19:30]  Move on.  We can't even get hot chicks.  Move along.  We can't give away vehicles.  We have nothing to give away.  We've been promoting this wow thing.  The only reason we promote it so much is because we have nothing else.  Let's just admit it.  What else do we have, Anthony?  I don't know.  No one's showing up.  No hot chicks.  No hot chicks.  $500 cold hard cash of Stockbroker Dave's money.  We can't get a hot chick up here.  Just put something in your mouth.  We're pathetic.  I don't get it.  Pathetic. 
[02:20:00]  God.  Crack the door open.  Just a hair.  I want to hear what's going on out there.  All right.  All right.  Ready?  Ben's opening the door.  She's ripping the tire off a Jeep right now.  She looks like she swallowed a tire off a Jeep.  Dude, what the hell?  Oh, God.  $500, but is everyone so well off these days?  Should we talk to her?  We used to be able to get...  Not me.  Want to break the news to her?  Where is she from? 
[02:20:30]  Why is everyone getting uncomfortable?  Well, get her.  Because this stuff is uncomfortable to talk about.  What do you mean?  It's like...  Oh, no.  Here you go, Donald's eyes.  Go into it.  Roll over.  She got Donald's eyes.  Eyes, roll over.  Yeah, eyes, roll over, right?  Oh, God.  Well, I'll break the news to her.  We have $500, and all that shows up is a one-parker.  She can't go down with $500 on her. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  You're it.  She coming in.  I love this.  This is so uncomfortable.  She won't pay through to the wall.  This is so uncomfortable.  Saints, $5.  And I'll handle this.  Dude.  I'm not going to be able to watch this.  It's just going to be a mess.  I'm going to paste a smile on my face.  Yeah.  I'm going to paste a smile on my face like I give a flying...  Why is everyone leaving?  I'm not doing this alone.  Hey, Stock Market Day.  You're going to stay in here. 
[02:21:30]  No, Dave.  Stay in here.  Hang on.  Hey.  Stock Market Day.  You can't hear me.  Listen to this.  Okay.  Watch this.  What?  I'm going to blame it.  I'm going to blame it on Stock Market Day.  Okay.  Do that.  What's your name?  Cara.  Hi, Cara.  Where are you from?  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  You came in to win Stock Market Day's money?  No.  I work down the street.  Oh, yeah?  Then how did you get in here?  But you didn't come in...  How did I get in here?  Did you come in to play win Stock Market Day's money? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, okay.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm really upset that I can't play now.  Well, why not?  Tell you the truth.  We were talking over and Dave wasn't happy with the talent.  It's all right.  He don't know what he's missing.  It's okay.  You are a dog.  That's okay.  I can tell by the look on his face.  He gave it away, you know?  As soon as I walked in.  Sold you down the river.  It's all right.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  I hope he sold you down the river, Dave. 
[02:22:30]  I have to go to a Met game.  He tried to see the Mets lose.  That's what it is.  Met game?  It's rained out.  Everyone knows that.  It's not rained out.  It's open dome.  You are dead.  You are dead.  Look at her, Dave.  That's okay.  That's all right.  He's been out there for an hour.  Hey, I'm not the one that's missing out.  What were you willing to do for Stockbroker Dave's money?  Whatever.  You said to do some oral on like an inanimate object.  I have been told that I've been the best.  Really? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, really?  By plenty of people.  You got that piercing on your tongue, huh?  Yeah.  And that works?  Let's find a chrome bumper.  It works.  Yeah?  What's wrong, Dave?  You've been told you're really good?  I've just been thrown under a bus.  Yeah.  Dave, look at her.  The least you can do is look at her.  If we get it going, we've got to be out of here in two minutes.  What are you giggling over there like a little?  I love when it gets uncomfortable in here. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  So I guess we're not playing Win Stockbroker Dave's money?  No.  That's okay.  Can you give her like a few dollars for making the effort, Dave?  Sure.  Sure.  I don't want pity money, man.  I don't want pity money.  Why?  Because that's not what I came down here for.  I came down here to do a job and win the contest, and that was it.  Right.  You know, and if I can't do that, then I'll just call another day. 
[02:24:00]  It's all right.  I listen to the show every day.  It's no big deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every day.  Cool.  All right.  What would you like her to do for $100?  Leave?  No, I'm just kidding.  That's a joke.  No big deal.  No big deal.  See?  See?  You thought it was me.  I don't care who it is.  It doesn't matter who it is.  It doesn't matter who it is.  You don't like it.  That's all right.  That's all right.  I came in.  I had to go to the Met game.  Anthony, the limo guy.  What's up?  Dave.  Hi, Anthony.  Jump over there right now and just punch him right in the face. 
[02:24:30]  Anthony.  Would I be wrong?  No.  He does it to me all the time.  Just jump over the counter right now.  Punch him right in the face.  Please, I will throw in $100 into it.  Hit him now.  All right.  I want to see a bruise on him tomorrow.  Oh, whatever.  Whatever, tough guy.  Anthony, I'm surprised you're not up here.  Like you care, Anthony.  I don't even want to talk to you.  I got issues.  All right.  Thank you, Ovi.  Let's go to Joe. 
[02:25:00]  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's messed up.  You know, even the fat chick deserves a chance to get some money.  Hey, I'm not a fat chick, dude.  I'm not a fat chick.  I'm just a big girl with big boobs, you know?  I mean.  You don't have a hard time coming through the door.  Well, yeah, Dave said that you'd have a hard time getting through the door.  Oh, jeez.  No, I'm not a fat chick.  I'm not a fat chick.  I'm a big girl.  I'm a big girl, but I'm not a fat chick.  Not a fat chick.  Not in that category.  Dave, why are you turning red? 
[02:25:30]  Because Anthony's right.  I should come over to this table and crack you more.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  No, I think you're low.  Okay, terrific.  Yes.  That's all right.  I don't mind.  What are you wearing there?  A little Winnie the Pooh thing?  Let me see.  Let me see.  It's my Winnie the Pooh.  All right.  Let's see the whole package.  He's got his mouth wide open waiting for it.  Ah.  There's some honey.  Yeah, let's see the whole package.  Let's see the rest of the body.  What?  My boobs?  Well, no.  Let's see the whole.  Just stand up.  My whole lot. 
[02:26:00]  Let's look.  Dave, would you give her money to show some boobs, maybe?  All right.  Oh, I'll give you a hundred dollars if she puts her boobs on your head.  A hundred dollars a boob.  No, no.  No, no.  I don't know.  They're pretty heavy boobs.  Are they?  What size are those?  They're triple D's.  Triple D's?  Yeah.  Triple D.  All right.  Okay.  You want to see her boobs?  Your friends want to see her boobs.  Guys?  Yeah, you can see it on their face.  Boobs are boobs, Dad.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, look at this.  Stockbroker Dave taking some money out. 
[02:26:30]  Consolation prize.  For boobs.  For boobs?  Wait, wait.  What do you give her?  We got to leave them.  Seriously, we are going to the main game.  I don't want to see her boobs.  We are going to the main game.  Seriously.  What do you give her?  Yeah, the whole top.  The whole top?  Yeah.  No doubt.  No doubt is right.  A Winnie the Pooh shirt coming off.  Wow.  That is a big, big brassiere.  Holy crap.  Wow.  Look at that.  There you go.  All right.  Those are very, very large.  Big boobs.  Yeah, when you hold them up, they look really good. 
[02:27:00]  You don't hold them up.  Don't hold them.  Let's see them.  Wow.  Yeah.  Those are large boobs.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah, those are big.  You don't have to hold them up.  I used to have a bar, Ted.  I could hold bottles underneath them and stuff.  Oh, yeah?  I'll give you a hundred bucks if you could hold the bottle under them.  Really?  Give me a bottle.  You got a white bottle?  Get a while.  Where's that Pepsi bottle in there?  I have the J.D. bottle underneath it.  I don't know.  I don't know a bottle of water.  You bet?  Not my water.  Let's go to Mary.  Mary on line nine.  Mary, what's up?  He's got no balls. 
[02:27:30]  Who?  No balls at all.  Dave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to be second to me.  You can tell the truth.  I mean, and then he gets all embarrassed to want to hit Opie.  What's that about?  He turned beet red, man.  He is so ballless.  It's disgusting.  He doesn't want to go through with something.  At least have the decency to back out politely.  Eat me, Mary.  Eat me, Mary.  Thank you, Mary.  Eat me.  Thank you, Mary.  I agree with you.  Just be honest with women.  You'll get a lot further that way. 
[02:28:00]  You are such a person.  And tell Dave, man, it don't matter how much money he has, when you have no more, you don't  hang the phone up, you skank.  All right, Mary.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  Okay.  Can you put your bra back on?  Sure.  Okay, good.  How about if I just put my shirt back on?  Shirt?  Yeah.  It's a pain to like...  Anything else, Dave?  That's it, kids.  We're going to the Met game.  It's been fun.  I'll speak to you tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  Some of the listeners chiming in worse than Opie.  So, can I take this now? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, take the hundred.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Awesome.  That's great.  Thank you, Dave.  Thank you.  This guy's saying, no, she's not a fat chick.  She's a fat chick who's in denial.  Oh.  It's our listeners.  You know how that is.  Two words, stack or two.  What, you're on the spaz cam?  Is she on the spaz cam?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  That girl isn't fat and O.J. isn't the killer.  The listeners are mean, man.  Ask her to see the gold medal for the woman's clean and jerk. 
[02:29:00]  But these are real.  They're not fake.  I understand.  They're real.  A hundred percent, all mine, natural.  James?  Yeah.  What's up, James?  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  I hate you.  What did I do?  What did I do?  I met you at the Super Bowl party.  You were cool.  Now I hate you.  What happened?  You're biting a tire off a Jeep.  You just made me spit a mouthful of you all over the windshield.  I don't remember that.  Ponderous.  All right, guys.  Ponderous.  Hey, see?  Those are a set of Major League Yabos. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  All right.  I like that.  Well, why don't you guys get to the Met game and...  And I'll go.  And you'll...  Yeah.  Why is Dave coming over here?  Hey, hold on.  There's someone on the hotline that wants to talk to you.  All right.  Otto and George.  You know who Otto and George are?  I hope not.  Otto and his friend, the dirty puppet, George?  No.  You don't know who Otto and George are?  Otto, they're very funny.  Hello, fat chick.  Hey, it's George.  The Burger King crowd.  They want to know what time you're getting off the air.  The kid's got to go to college. 
[02:30:00]  Hello?  Yes, George.  Hello?  That stinky whore?  Hello, please.  God.  Slow day for you guys.  All right.  You hit it on the...  I'll be up there with a bag of shredded lettuce.  Wish you were here, Otto.  Oh, really?  Is that Norris?  Yeah.  Hey, Norris, how you doing?  Hey, what would you do to your buddy's arm there, George?  Would you beat Otto up?  Guys, I threw my elbow out in Lancaster, and it's my puppet arm.  So it's like, I don't know, I'm turning into evil Knievel. 
[02:30:30]  It's horrible.  Oh, it's great, man.  Every time I give a puffer, he gets a shooting pain in his arm.  Delicious fun.  What?  Delicious torture.  Every ten minutes, the song is going to kick Norris in the skin graft, too.  That's a fun show.  Just so we don't have a good night either.  We're going to look like...  Oh, man.  All right, so wait, the right arm works the puppet.  Now you're going to have to work the puppet with the left arm?
