<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in sexually suggestive banter and promoting "Whip Him Out Wednesday," a listener contest involving women flashing their breasts.  Opie recounted a near-miss with taxis, while Anthony described a rushed entry into the studio to avoid a confrontation. They discussed Breathe Right strips, Anthony's ankle injury, and a fan-made video combining their B-show footage with *Saving Private Ryan*.  The conversation turned to a negative review of the *Bad News Bears* remake, contrasted with praise for the *Pink Panther* remake.  A phone call with Mike Bossy followed, discussing the NHL gambling scandal involving Wayne Gretzky's wife, prompting numerous jokes from the hosts. Listener calls ensued, covering the "WOW" sticker campaign, the NHL scandal, and various movie remakes and sequels (*Poseidon*, *The Hills Have Eyes*, *When a Stranger Calls*, *The Longest Yard*, *Miami Vice*, *Superman Returns*, *X-Men 3*, *King Kong*, *Batman Begins*), punctuated by crude humor. Jim Norton concluded this segment with a riddle containing a racist punchline.

The show continued with thanks to Tom Ferreira for criticizing a Howard Stern review in *Entertainment Weekly*, highlighting their use of the Pat O'Brien tapes.  A listener-submitted remix of O'Brien's voicemail overlaid on Terry Schiavo audio was played.  A significant portion focused on criticizing Howard Stern's move to Sirius, disputing his claims about subscriber growth, mocking his girlfriend's commercial, and playing a clip demonstrating censorship imposed by Stern's former employer.  The segment concluded with more jabs at Stern, boasts about their own show's success, and a listener's description of a graphic Japanese pornographic video.

Next, a segment featuring Sports Illustrated columnist Jay (in-studio) discussed Dateline's "To Catch a Predator," reacting to audio clips of men entrapped attempting to meet underage girls.  The conversation digressed to Jay's column, American censorship (compared to erectile dysfunction ads), an anecdote about Jay's ex-wife's MySpace page, an extended, explicit discussion about urination, hockey, Wayne Gretzky's wife, and VH1's "Celebrity Fit Club."  A lengthy, offensive phone call with Harvey Walden, a drill instructor on the show, ensued.  The segment was heavily laced with vulgar language, including homophobic slurs.

A subsequent segment again focused on Dateline's "To Catch a Predator" clips, interspersed with crude comments and jokes.  Notable moments included a caller comparing an arrested man to Bob Kelly, discussion of prison life, a call from a supposed Pete Townsend, the revelation of a Homeland Security agent's arrest, jokes about Opie's girlfriend, mention of a deleted *Godfather* scene, and a nonsensical listener song.  The latter half shifted to criticism of the Steve Martin *Pink Panther* remake and a discussion of their studio move, featuring the intern and staff.  This concluded with another bizarre urination competition between the hosts and a staff member.

The final segment discussed Heather Locklear and Richie Sambora's separation, attributing it to provocative photos. A news story about a teenager falling from a moving bus while using the restroom followed, sparking crude jokes and speculation.  Listener calls included anecdotes, challenges to Jimmy's urination claims, a request for "Stoner Spelling Bee," banter about mispronouncing Shirley Hemphill's name, and a comparison of hockey to washing an uncircumcised penis.  The segment concluded with a promotion for Rich Voss's comedy show.

What kind of sick mind operates like that?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I know a thing about a thing or two, liar, liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.

The last time I'm gonna ask you.  He's pissed.  Yeah, he sure is.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Motherfuck.  You're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Hello, we're doing just fine over here at XM. 
[00:05:30]  Trust me on that.  We'll get into that in a few minutes, by the way.  But first, it's Chris in Kentucky.  He wants to explain, wow, because it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Chris, what's going on?  Good morning, Norton and friends.  How are you doing on this fine Whip Him Out Wednesday morning?  Oh.  Okay, I'll go ahead with the wow.  For all you new listeners out there, this is Wednesday.  And for Opie and Anthony, that means that it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Or Whip Him Out whenever for the rest of the week. 
[00:06:00]  It's as simple as this.  It's quite possibly the best radio promotion in the history since Marconi.  Simple.  W-O-W-W-O.  Get a bumper sticker.  Go to Opie and Anthony.com.  Click the wow sticker logo with the self-addressed.com below.  You can send to that address.  Get a wow sticker sent to you.  Make one yourself.  Stick it on your window.  Write it down the dirt on your truck if you're a nasty fucker like me.  And hopefully, if the ladies are feeling like it, they'll show you those fun bags.  Hey, wow.  That's not bad, Chris.  Very good description.  And we're looking for wow sightings today, definitely. 
[00:06:30]  Well, I haven't seen anything later, but I'll let you know if I do.  Y'all have a good nap on tonight.  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  Thank you.  My adrenaline was racing this morning.  There is something that happens in New York City.  I think we've explained this before.  But early in the morning, man, there's like hundreds and hundreds of cabbies out there looking for fares.  Yep.  And usually, I'm very careful.  I go to the end of my block, and I raise my little hand, and a cab usually will come to a nice stop, and I get in, and we just take off toward the radio station, right? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  But some mornings, I'm not thinking.  I'm not paying attention, and I just walk out there and raise my hand.  See, you've got to raise your hand when only one cabbie's coming.  That is the key at like 545 in the morning.  One cabbie, raise hand.  One cabbie, raise hand.  This morning, I'm not thinking.  I'm a little tired.  I raise my hand.  Three cabbies are now racing toward me at the same fucking time.  Converging on you.  And these guys are animals. 
[00:07:30]  They don't give a shit.  All they want to do is make money.  These guys work like 16 straight hours.  Not many fares at that hour of the morning.  So they're really, really predatorial.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're fighting for any fare they could get.  Yep.  So now it's just a race to get to my corner, three of them.  I'm watching this unfold in front of my eyes.  I'm like, am I seeing this?  One guy gets cut off.  The other guy jams on his brake and then it breaks.  And then there's a third one that almost hits the rear of the second cab there. 
[00:08:00]  That's wonderful.  Almost a three cab pileup.  A pretty savage pileup.  I'm amazed that they didn't get in an accident, right?  Yeah.  So then now two out of the three are stopped there, beeping.  Like, get in.  And I'm like, what?  And I just throw my hands up like, what the fuck, right?  How do you make your choice?  So the one guy takes off and the other guy goes, get the fuck in the cab.  He curses at me.  I'm like, fuck you.  Get the fuck in the cab.  I go after that shit?  No.  And then he starts screaming at me.  He's like, it was the guy that cut me off, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, bye.  Bye.  Jesus.  So now he's giving me the finger and racing off.  Curtis Sliwa got more courteous cab service.  Really, really pissed off.  The guy leaves, right?  And then I step back onto the curb and I see just one cabbie.  Has no clue what happened.  Just raise my little hand.  And like it's supposed to be.  Comes to a stop.  I jump in.  Bam.  Good to go.  Step on it.  But what a way to start the morning.  And this isn't the first time I've jumped out of the way of cabs. 
[00:09:00]  No, they're animals.  Today I thought the cab was going to be on the sidewalk.  That's how white you are?  They're actually piling up to get a hold of you.  Piling up, yes.  Did you add in the fact that they passed five black people to get to you?  With their hands raised in business suits?  No, but see.  Danny Glover was one of them.  The key to getting a cab, though, is if you're going south, it's no problem.  Yeah.  You know, I'm heading in the right direction.  Trust me.  What do you mean by the right direction?  These cabbies are very, very relieved when they go south and they pick up a whitey. 
[00:09:30]  They don't want to go north.  Yeah, they're kind of upper west side.  No, it's a known fact.  You don't want to go north if you're a cabbie.  Do a little experiment.  Go on a road that's going north.  You don't see as many cabs as a road that's going south in Manhattan.  They want to go south.  That's the reality of what's going on in Manhattan.  So I'm like, holy crap, what a way to start.  And then I leave the building just to go get Starbucks.  And cabs are stopping and beeping their horns just thinking I'm a fare.  I'm like, I'm just fucking trying to get coffee. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  That's how desperate these guys are.  It's so dangerous.  You know?  Every once in a while you see it in the post or the daily news.  You'll see a cab, you know, through a storefront or knocks down a whole newsstand.  Oh, yeah.  That's fucking guys being aggressive trying to get fares.  That's all that is.  Competing with each other.  Yep.  They're not drunk.  They didn't, like, hit the gas by accident.  No.  They know exactly what they're doing.  They're aggressively trying to get the fare over somebody else.  And sometimes, oops.  And they end up in a storefront every once in a while.  We get, like, four or five of these a year easily in Manhattan. 
[00:10:30]  Well, I had a little adventure myself this morning.  Yeah.  I pulled up in front of the building here.  I could do every morning meeting Master Poe, wonderful, our security guy, trained killer.  And I get out of my vehicle, and there's Poe greeting me like he does every morning.  And then I look across the street, kind of down the sidewalk, and this giant black gentleman  is kind of coming towards us.  And he kind of has an angry look on his face. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know what it is.  He's like, he just didn't look like he was coming up to say good morning.  Wasn't running or anything.  He just, it was a very consistent walk kind of towards us.  Master Poe, what did you do now to protect me, your charge?  Well, I grabbed you quickly, and I kind of tossed you inside, opened the door, and threw  you inside.  He opened the door and threw me in through the door. 
[00:11:30]  And then slammed the door shut.  You know how the door kind of slowly closes?  Yeah.  That wasn't fast enough for Poe.  Threw me in, slammed the door shut, and immediately turned around and started walking towards the  gentleman that was walking towards us.  He's protecting you like a president.  I love it.  I love it.  He was about 275 pounds, about 6'1", bald, black.  And he didn't have a nice look on.  Poe, I want to sing something to you. 
[00:12:00]  And I will always love you.  From my bodyguard.  Yeah, yeah.  Or the bodyguard.  That's terrific.  This doesn't mean I have to hug you, does it?  No.  No, I wouldn't appreciate that.  Keep flinging me through doorways.  That's fine.  So what finally happened with the bigger fellow?  Yeah, what happened to him?  Well, when I tossed you inside.  Oh, by the way, I'm sorry if I pushed you.  Nah, that's fine.  I'll take that over what could have happened any day. 
[00:12:30]  I turned around, and I went back outside, and I looked at him, and he looked at me.  And we took about five seconds looking at each other, and he turned around and walked  away.  Hmm.  I don't know what his shenanigans were.  Where were you guys standing?  Right outside?  Right in front of the building.  Right at the front door.  Oh, he was on the sidewalk.  He was walking down 57th towards the building from west, coming east, down the sidewalk.  I was like, oh, this is great.  This caught my eye immediately. 
[00:13:00]  End pose.  You know, it was one of those situations where you're like, all right, probably nothing,  but you never know.  You never know.  So, uh, thank you, Paul.  You don't want this happening to you.  You're welcome, guys.  Yeah, uh, which way is north?  Oh, well, let me see.  It's right.  Oh, it's just coming around.  Wait, hello?  What?  Was my family all around?  Christmas?  Christmas?  Didn't Christmas just pass? 
[00:13:30]  I was going to get a Valentine's Day card.  What happened?  What happened?  Why is everybody making New Year's plans?  You know what my favorite part of that promo is?  It's Steve.  Excuse me.  Ready to give the north directions?  Yeah, yeah.  Which way is north.  Well, it's going to be exactly how we all want to react when he talks.  Punch him.  And Jimmy, what's up with the nose?  Those things don't work.  They do. 
[00:14:00]  I really don't think they work.  What they, I'm wearing a breatherite strip.  Yeah.  What they do is.  How does it work?  I'll tell you.  You have two little openings, like a shotgun barrel, say, is your sinuses.  Ooh.  But it's cartilage, so it's a softer.  With you, it should be.  Oh, no.  Oh, Ant, that would hurt.  And you put the breatherite, and it holds them open.  It makes your airways a little rounder.  Ooh.  Instead of kind of caving in on itself.  Yeah.  The pressure down pops them open.  It does work.  I mean, it's not going to cure you for life, but it does help you breathe easier. 
[00:14:30]  And you're going to do the whole show with one of those things on?  The whole day.  Why?  I sleep with them every night.  You never knew that.  No.  Thank God.  You went back to your fancy place.  You never knew what I slept with.  Thank God.  I don't know that.  And I woke up.  My nose was bad today, because I had a little apartment painting done, so I have dust kicking  up.  Ah.  So I decided to wear the old breatherite strip.  Allergic reaction.  It's bad sinuses.  Clogs you up.  Yeah.  Makes me sniffly.  I would love to go through your medicine cabinet.  It's uneventful.  I bet you have some stupid stuff in there. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, for a while.  I have a lot of-  Just dumb stuff.  Yeah.  For all your dumb ailments.  Nose stuff.  A lot of it.  A lot of it.  A lot of these supplements.  These holistic supplemental things.  We still can't walk home, because his foot still hurts.  And fancy soap he bought once in Washington.  My foot does still hurt.  I stopped going for treatment, because I went to L.A.  It doesn't hurt that much.  You can walk with your pal.  I'll show you my swollen ankle.  You can go like-  You can poke it.  You can do that to it.  Poke.  Poke.  What does it feel like?  Is it soft and-  A little bit, but it only is when I put certain stress on it. 
[00:15:30]  The weight of walking a lot makes it swell up more.  Oh, yeah.  So, I mean, it's a legitimate injury.  I was on the bike yesterday.  It started to hurt.  Oh.  But I toughed through it, folks.  All right.  Well, he's got the Breathe Right strip on, so we're ready to broadcast.  Bruce in Louisiana, what's up?  Yeah, hiya, sweetie.  Hi.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to be heading in the white direction.  Is that right?  Okay, car crash.  No, no.  Anyway-  Don't car crash, sir.  You mean heaven.  See, we don't like to be as obvious on this program.  We like you to figure out some things. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  If you request the car crash, you're Sean.  It makes it much more entertaining.  What's up, Bruce?  Anyway, I wanted to say, the guy that did the Saving Private Ryan B's video, that was fucking  awesome.  I watched it like 20 times in a row, man.  He even got the audio with the guy's lips moving a little bit.  Great job.  Yeah, we were talking about that yesterday.  That video's up on opiananthony.com.  They took the ending of our B show and mixed it in with the Private Ryan video, Saving Private  Ryan video, and it's great. 
[00:16:30]  It really is.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Watched that movie.  Last night, popped it in the DVD player.  Fantastic movie.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't like that as much.  So depressing.  But Jesus Christ, that little coward motherfucker that just pretty much gets everyone killed.  Oh, is that annoying to watch?  Go up the stairs.  Shoot the big Nazi.  For Christ's sake.  You know what I did?  I watched Bad News Bears.  Oh. 
[00:17:00]  Which one?  Well, I'm going to get into this a little bit.  So, you know, I got movies on demand and Bad News Bears with Billy Bob Thornton is finally  on the system, right?  So I check it out.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  The kids don't curse.  The kids' acting is awful.  You don't believe Billy Bob Thornton is the character he's, you know, playing.  Tatum O'Neill as the chick pitcher in the new movie.  The worst acting I've ever seen in a film.  I was so disappointed.  So disappointed. 
[00:17:30]  They didn't curse the kids?  They didn't curse.  You know, in the original Bad News Bears, they're talking about this team is made up  of nothing but niggers, kikes, wops.  You know, kids are saying this stuff, right?  And in the original movie, well, here's what I was getting at.  So I watched the original movie last night.  And I was like, and then you're reminded how they have just wimped out with making movies  in Hollywood.  Especially comedies.  You know, in the original movie, you got Walter Matthau driving around with the open  beer can.  He's driving, drinking with kids in the car. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, with the kids in the car, you know, in the original Bad News Bears, they're cursing  like crazy.  And at the end of Bad News Bears, and this is what shocked me, because I haven't seen  the movie in a long time, you know, when they lose to the Yankees there.  Yeah.  He starts handing out beers in the dugout.  And the kids are drinking the beer.  Yeah.  Gives beers to the kids.  Gives beers to the kids.  And they're drinking.  And one of the fathers is like, hey, hey, don't drink that.  But the rest of them are drinking and pouring beer over each other's heads, celebrating their  fine season. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  In the remake, Billy Bob Thornton, he hands out non-alcoholic beers at the end of the  fucking movie.  Are you shitting me?  They couldn't even go the distance there.  And because Billy Bob Thornton cleaned up his act, he's not drinking anymore, because  the kids showed him the way.  So they have the same exact scene, but he's handing out non-alcoholic beer in the dugout.  I'm like, ugh.  Well, I don't know.  That's a bad message to send out, that kids should be drinking.  Go fuck yourself.  It's a comedy.  But I don't know. 
[00:19:00]  Bring back our comedies.  Oh, but I think that drinking and driving is dangerous.  Stop worrying about, you know, the political correctness crap.  Offending people.  They were worried that people were going to say, oh, this is giving a bad message.  Bad message.  Bad message.  And I'm thinking, right, I want to see the new Bad News Bears when it came out, because  I'm thinking Billy Bob Thornton, Bad Santa.  That was great.  That movie was great, because they went the distance.  It was pretty brutal, right, with the language and stuff?  Yeah.  So I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:19:30]  This guy is perfect for a remake.  And I hate remakes in general, but I'm thinking, I think this is going to work, because they  picked Billy Bob Thornton.  He just came off Bad Santa.  It's got to be good.  And you know how, in the original movie, the team is sponsored by Chico Bale Bonds or whatever?  You know, when Billy Bob Thornton in the new movie had to go find uniforms, they actually  show Chico Bale Bonds, and they pass on sponsoring the team.  But guess what?  A strip club said yes.  Oh, I get it.  That's how...  That's their...  Outrageous. 
[00:20:00]  That's them being edgy.  Wow.  A strip club?  Wow.  So now they've got a strip club on the back of their uniforms, and then they have a few  strippers in the stands cheering on the kids.  Fully clothed.  That's how edgy they got.  That's as edgy as they could get with this stupid movie.  Except for the fact that they went to Hooters.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Kids at Hooters.  That's dangerous.  Wow.  That's dangerous.  You never know what's going to happen there.  I was screaming at the TV when I saw the Billy Bob Thornton movie.  I'm like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  Don't make these movies, especially the remakes, if you're going to wimp out. 
[00:20:30]  Well, one remake that's just a gem.  It's a little something called The Pink Panther.  Ooh.  I've been seeing more trailers for it on television.  The scene where Steve Martin is trying to say hamburger.  I'm on the floor laughing my ass off, because it's so funny.  It's so much better than the original.  Hamburger.  Oh, stop.  See, you're going to get me going now.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Peter Sellers was no good.  Nah. 
[00:21:00]  Nah.  He might as well fall down the steps.  Oh, wonderful.  Where he's reading the newspaper and not paying attention.  It's like trying to disguise himself at the newspaper.  And what does he do?  He walks right down some subway steps.  It's amazing how hack and awful he made one of the funniest scenes ever shot, which is  Clouseau saying, I was a master of the parallel bars.  And then, because he's on the upstairs and he's on the parallel bars, and when he dismounts,  it's right down a flight of steps.  Down a stairwell.  Oh, God, was that great. 
[00:21:30]  It's funny.  I've been watching that.  My father and I used to watch that for 25 years, and I still laugh when I see it.  A bim.  A bim.  Guys, I've got to interrupt.  We can get back in a movie talk in a second, but we've got a legend on the line here.  Mike Bossy from the New York Islanders.  Mike Bossy.  Hello, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  It's a pleasure to talk to you.  I'm a huge Islander fan.  Well, I wouldn't have thought otherwise.  You have good taste.  Thank you, sir.  Well, we've had a bad team for many years. 
[00:22:00]  We're hoping to turn it around, right?  That's true, too.  You laugh at the New Islanders, I bet.  Well, I'm not going to make any excuses for them and say that they're a great team and  that they have been for the past, when did I retire?  87.  So they've been struggling for like 19, 20 years now.  They sure have.  And I'm still supporting them.  Why?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  But we got you on the phone today because of this NHL scandal that's breaking today. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  You know, I always look at, and I was just talking about it five minutes ago on the Canadian side.  And, you know, I may be a little naive in thinking that it's just a little debt here and there.  But apparently it's a lot deeper than that.  And I would imagine that you don't go accusing or, you know, arresting people for betting 20 bucks or 30 bucks on a sport. 
[00:23:00]  So it doesn't look very good.  But you know what, guys?  It really doesn't surprise me.  I mean, if you look at professional sports, you look at the money that these guys are making these days.  And it's not, I mean, the gambling, I mean, they may have uncovered something with a bunch of guys now.  But, I mean, you look at all the other professional sports, there seems to be a scandal that breaks out every two or three months. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, well, could you walk us through this?  I don't really get it yet because I just started reading about it this morning.  But basically there's a gambling ring that started in Jersey?  Well, I don't know.  Or is it going through Jersey and Wayne Gretzky's wife is involved?  Like, I'm confused here.  And they're saying they didn't vote.  They didn't bet on hockey games, but they bet on football and baseball games?  A lot of college games.  You know, it sort of sounds like there's a lot more to be uncovered.  And I don't really know that much more than you guys, only that an assistant coach of a professional hockey team is involved. 
[00:24:00]  And the coach's wife is involved.  And I guess the funniest thing that I've heard since yesterday was when Wayne Gretzky was interviewed.  He says, I don't know.  He says, you'll have to ask my wife about that.  But, you know, when you don't know what your wife is doing, I mean, it's a pretty strange answer to give.  Why is Wayne Gretzky's wife involved in some kind of a betting ring? 
[00:24:30]  I mean, that just sounds like it has to be just some kind of problem or boredom, I guess.  Well, you never know.  Like I said, well, he is in Phoenix, and I think she is in Los Angeles still or California.  So, you know, I guess in the next couple of days we'll hear a lot more.  And, I mean, I just hope for the National Hockey League's sake that it's not as bad as it looks on the surface  because the league has just come back from a lockout. 
[00:25:00]  They've changed a lot of rules.  They've changed their image.  And the league is looking good now.  And this is absolutely an enormous black mark on the league as of this morning anyway.  Yeah, it's a developing story.  What do you think of the new rules in the NHL?  You know, I love the new rules.  I love the fact that the players are able to be a lot more creative on the ice.  I love the skating that we see. 
[00:25:30]  The shootout I think is great.  You know, there are some great young players in the league this year with Ovechkin in Washington  and Crosby in Pittsburgh and Kovalchuk in Atlanta.  I mean, those are great young players who are exciting the fans.  And they're letting them excite the fans because they're letting them play hockey.  And I think that's the most important thing.  I love the shootout.  I'm a season ticket holder.  And it always sucked when you went to a game and it ended in like a 3-3 tie. 
[00:26:00]  You felt like you got nothing from the game in a way.  And now when you get into shootout mode and the whole place just stands up,  it's just pure excitement for like two or three minutes at the end there.  Well, guys, I can tell you that as a player when I was playing, it sucked.  The tie game sucked for us too because you knew that in the last five or ten minutes of a game,  if the score was tied, that everything went into a defensive mode and that you were just playing for the point.  And, you know, the overtime brought a little element of excitement to the game. 
[00:26:30]  But I think the shootout now just keeps everyone in their seats and then standing for the shootout.  I think it's just been great.  Yeah.  Can you imagine if they had the rule when you were playing, Mike?  I would have loved it.  I would have loved these rules when I was playing.  You would have had a minimum of another ten goals a season.  Well, hey.  This guy was great on the breakaway.  People have been saying that to me, and I say to them, listen, I had an average of 57 goals a year. 
[00:27:00]  How many do you want me to score?  I couldn't be too greedy, you know?  Yeah.  There you go.  I hear that we only have a few minutes with you.  I didn't even know you were on XM.  I'm going to check you out.  Well, that's good, and I'll check you guys out, too.  Well, it's...  I heard you guys are pretty...  I won't go.  Go ahead.  Be honest.  Go ahead.  What have you heard about the Opie and Anthony show, Mike Bossie?  I just...  The word...  The name Howard Stern came into the same conversation as talking about your guys' show. 
[00:27:30]  Well, honestly, I think we're a better show, but...  Oh, well, hey.  Well, you know, I wouldn't be surprised at all, because he used to be in Montreal, and  they gassed him in Montreal, so...  No, I'll have to listen to you guys.  I love to laugh.  I love to laugh.  All right.  You should call back in a few weeks and give your review.  Okay.  Sounds good.  Mike, where can we listen to you?  Well, XM, and you know what? 
[00:28:00]  I don't even know the...  XM204, Home Ice?  That's right.  Exactly.  Absolutely.  Thanks for bailing me out, guys.  And what?  You're on every morning at 6 a.m.?  Every...  No, every morning at 7.10.  7.10 to 7.20.  Wow.  That's a tough gig.  Where do I get that gig?  10 minutes a day?  Well, I get paid for 10 minutes a day, too, huh?  That's wonderful.  Don't forget that.  Yeah, all right.  Good point.  All right, Mike.  Thank you so much.  You're very welcome.  I'll talk to you guys again.  All right.  Mike Bossie, everyone.  Bye-bye.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  That's very cool.  Well, yeah.  He seemed to hint, if I may now disseminate his little conversation.  This is going to be a huge story.  He seemed to hint that this scratched the surface.  Yeah.  Could be some more people involved.  Could be a little more deep reaching, which would be a blow to the NHL.  Again, coming off the heels of the lockout, when you've got somebody like the Great One.  Gretzky's wife is going to get Gretzky in so much trouble.  Right. 
[00:29:00]  From the Great One.  To tarnish that record with some kind of scandal like this, some post-career scandal, is just,  oh, you'd have to smack that bitch in the face.  This is going to be very interesting.  Well, maybe he was placing Betstor.  You never know.  If he's directly involved like that.  Well, that just means they have a gambling problem, because I can't imagine they need money.  I don't know if they were doing so much gambling as they were the bookmaker in the whole thing.  That seems to be where this was coming from.  Like, people were placing Betstor through them. 
[00:29:30]  I'm starting to think Mrs. Gretzky's a shady character.  Involved.  There are some allegations being made that there were some mob ties in Jersey.  A guy, Tony Soprano, I think his name is.  So, yeah, it's a developing story.  All right, here's the story as reported on the news this morning.  And game over for a gambling ring allegedly linked to the mob in South Jersey and Philadelphia. 
[00:30:00]  Former NHL star Rick Tockett is accused of financing the multi-million dollar ring.  He is now an assistant coach with the Phoenix Coyotes.  Investigators say most of the betting was on football and basketball at the college level.  About a half dozen former and current hockey players allegedly placed Betts, along with the wife of superstar Wayne Gretzky.  I don't know.  I mean, you'd have to ask her that.  It's not a hockey-related issue.  It's a football thing.  And, you know, to this time, I can't really comment on anything further. 
[00:30:30]  Investigators say Tockett organized the ring with the help of New Jersey State Trooper James Harney.  Harney allegedly took Betts while he was on patrol.  And Gretzky's going, you're going to have to ask her about that?  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't even know the bitch.  Yeah.  Who?  What?  Who is she?  What?  Look, man, she's an alcoholic, all right?  I don't know.  I saw in a couple of movies.  That's a joke, by the way.  We have no idea.  But I don't know.  There's some shit that's going to come out in the coming days.  And the newscasters have to all, you know, hockey players netted in this sting operation. 
[00:31:00]  They're going to be slap-shotted with some charges, I'm sure.  They've got to throw the hockey analogies in there.  It's just awful.  Wayne Gretzky looking for a stick save.  A stick save on this one.  Are they going to have to put their futures on ice?  Yuck.  I bet they wish the Zamboni could come in and clean up this mess.  Will Wayne Gretzky be going to the penalty box? 
[00:31:30]  Wayne Gretzky.  Wayne Gretzky.  Oh.  Wayne Gretzky says, go puck your mother.  Breathe right, Strip.  I couldn't help it.  Gretzky.  I was puffed.  Any more?  I don't think they'll be skating this one.  Or is Wayne Gretzky skating on thin ice? 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  Hey.  Tune in at 11.  I'm still in the game.  Come on.  Wayne would let his wife do anything so he could get to her penalty box.  All right.  Let's say hi to Wade in Toronto.  Wade.  How you doing, guys?  Are you listening on XM Canada or still illegally?  Still illegally, man.  Nice.  I'm afraid to switch her over.  I might lose it.  Nice.  Something as legal as listening in Canada without a Canadian subscription. 
[00:32:30]  Okay, Pookie.  Turn on the XM.  What's up, Wade?  I watched it last night and seeing Rick talk at space.  And then to see Wayne Gretzky, man, you know there's some shit going down.  Yeah, it's more deep-reaching than they're getting at right now.  You know it.  That's just it, man.  To see their looks, you know that there's something else.  And honestly, though, how much money can they be making off the NHL betting?  I really do think that a lot of this was at the U.S. level because that's huge in the States, right? 
[00:33:00]  Who knows?  When they start getting into maybe other people being involved, but they don't want to say it,  you think they'll be like, hmm, could somebody else be in this mess?  E-A.  I don't know.  Well, they're not giving any other names.  Messier?  Shit.  Oh, I didn't even get it.  I wasn't listening, to be totally honest.  Me neither.  I'm grateful I wasn't after hearing the explanation.  Travis gave me a thumbs up.  Messier. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you, Wade.  Kiss ass.  What was it exactly?  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  It was Messier.  No, but I didn't know.  How did you say it?  See, his name is.  I'm going to explain it again.  Let's go to Pete Rose.  Pete Rose.  Check it out.  What's up, Pete?  Hey, I believe they're innocent.  I don't care if I have a bad haircut or not.  They're innocent.  All right.  Wow.  Pete Rose saying Wayne is innocent.  Thank you, sir.  I said he never bet on hockey.  That excuse worked for you, didn't it?  Never bet on baseball except when I was betting on baseball. 
[00:34:00]  Let's go, Matt.  Are Wayne and his wife going to go to Rikers Islanders?  Oh, God.  Oh.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, you see there, Mom?  You might want to check the instant feedback.  They might have some jokes.  Can't get instant feedback.  I couldn't get on it.  Really?  Instant feedback sounds.  Steve, get that up.  Thank you.  Let's go to Matt.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, I'm in Patville, Kentucky, and I just wanted to tell you guys the virus is spreading  like crazy here.  Yeah?  I've been listening to you guys for 13 months, and I thought I was the only one in this little 
[00:34:30]  old town that listened to you guys.  And now, just in the last month or so, every stop sign in my hometown has a WOW sticker on it.  That rocks.  Love it.  There's something going on with those WOW stickers, by the way.  Intern Bill, he's still not on the payroll.  This kid is unbelievable, by the way.  I watch him just pack tons and tons of WOW stickers in FedEx envelopes all morning long.  Yeah, he's shipping them out.  I don't even know how this is working.  I guess we have something on one of our websites where you can request a ton of WOW stickers 
[00:35:00]  for your own sticker stop or something.  Right, Bill?  And you're sending out just tons of WOW stickers on a daily basis, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Every day, I'm sending out.  Just packages of WOW stickers?  Yeah.  I've looked at mine.  Sticker stops are for envelopes.  And now these guys...  Anonymously sending them to various addresses, unsolicited.  Well, now these guys, they take the WOW stickers and they're just sticking them everywhere.  Good.  Thank you.  I need to get my WOW sticker.  I don't have one yet, and I've been trying to get one forever. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Opie, how could he do that?  I don't know.  Tape a stop sign in your hometown or you're back in your bumper.  Matt, hold on the line.  We'll get you a dress.  We'll send out a sticker immediately, okay?  Or a P.O. box now, isn't there?  You guys rock.  Or something.  Yeah, I don't know the P.O. box, but we'll send him a sticker immediately.  The P.O. box, gentlemen.  Second time Gretzky's wife screwed up his career.  I'm trying to remember this one.  Greg, Wisconsin, what's up?  Hey, man, what's up?  I'm originally from New York.  I just live here now.  What I'm saying, in 1988, do you remember when Gretzky went to the Kings? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And then what happened was all the expansion in the league in the southern markets, which  pretty much led to this lockout, which no one pretty much showed up after Gretzky  went away.  What I'm trying to say is that Gretzky expressed to Messier he wanted to stay at Edmonton,  but his wife, Janet Jones, the actress, wanted to go to Los Angeles with him.  Yeah.  And now, 20 years later, she's in this gambling ring.  Yeah, he pretty much decided to go with his wife.  She was a hot piece of ass back in the day, Janet Jones.  There's something going on with her that's going to come out.  Yeah, she definitely was. 
[00:36:30]  Opie, I'm a big Islander fan, too.  I feel your pain.  I'm punching out.  All right.  I'll see you at the Flyers game in a month.  Yeah, but hot chick or not, when you're Wayne Gretzky, you say, look, fucking just act  like a rich whore at home.  Yeah.  Here's your gig, stupid.  That's your gig.  Well, her being an actress, former actress, who knows what she is now.  You know, she kind of was highfalutin, thinking, I got my career, you got yours.  But she barely acted.  Of course she didn't.  What was she in?  She was in that movie with Dylan, right?  Matt Dylan?  What the hell was the name of that? 
[00:37:00]  She was walking around in a bathing suit the whole movie.  Oh, I remember it.  It was just fuck your millionaire husband.  Coca-Cola Kid?  What?  Was that the Coca-Cola Kid?  Something.  I don't know.  He was like a cabana boy or something in that movie.  How did I miss this one?  That's the only one I remember.  Sounds good.  Go to Janet Jones.  We'll look her up right now really fast.  Janet Jones.  She was in a league of their own?  No, she wasn't.  Yeah.  Go back, dude.  Dirt.  Wait, wait.  Look at these credits.  Go all the way up. 
[00:37:30]  She was in Alpha Dog.  She was in Dirt Nap.  She was in Soldier of Fortune.  I've never heard of this.  Exactly.  She was in Tough and Deadly.  Wow.  She was in The Firm?  Who was she in The Firm?  Wait.  The Firm.  No, The Firm Total Body, Low Impact Aerobics.  And it's V, so she just did a voiceover in it.  A League of Their Own she was in.  She was a pitcher.  Police Academy 5.  The Flamingo Kid.  That was the good one.  American Anthem. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  A Chorus Line.  We're all the way back to 85.  Still looking for a hit.  The Flamingo Kid.  There you go.  That was the movie.  That was it.  That was the one that was supposed to make her a huge star and nothing after that.  Well, now, all right, now you're talking the big movie.  Huh.  Staying Alive.  Staying Alive.  The sequel to Saturday Night Fever.  But she was only a dancer in that.  The movie was bad and she was a dancer.  She was in The Beastmaster in 1982.  As Witch Woman No. 3?  Isn't that the three witches? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, they were in there and they were all made up so you couldn't even see what they looked like.  She was a dancer in Annie, Snow White Live.  She was a dancer.  She's had a horrendous career.  Yeah, she stinks.  Who does she look like in this picture?  Her dumb teeth.  She has big horse teeth.  They're nice teeth.  She's beautiful, actually.  She doesn't look beautiful in this picture.  Especially for an older woman.  She's aight.  Who does she remind me of?  Her stupid smile is bugging me.  We got Seabass with a hockey headline. 
[00:39:00]  Seabass.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Is there trouble brewing in the NHL?  Stay tuned till 11.  Aren't you now?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, why trouble brewing?  Oh, brewing.  Oh, brewing.  Oh, brewing.  Oh, okay.  Oh, as in brewing?  He said brewing, though.  All right.  Yeah, he said brewing.  You said brewing.  I suck.  Stink.  That's what I do now when people stink.  Ooh.  Because that'll be really annoying.  Let's go to Ken in California.  Ken?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Ken?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys were going to get back to talking about remakes and movies? 
[00:39:30]  Of course.  It's one of our favorite topics here.  We hate the remake.  Okay.  This year, we've got a ton.  All right.  We got Poseidon Adventure, the remake, and that.  You know, all right.  Didn't they just do a TV movie?  Yes, they did.  There was two versions of the movie.  Like, yeah, one for TV, and now there's going to be one for theaters.  But it's only called Poseidon.  Yeah, why do they do that?  Yeah.  No adventure there.  But it's directed by Wolfgang Peterson, and he's done a lot of good stuff.  Someone pointed out, maybe not even you, actually, that maybe they do Poseidon just so people  know which one.  Like, they know it's a remake. 
[00:40:00]  Like, if you're talking about it, they just say, you know, they mean the new one.  Yeah.  That's the only reason I can guess.  The Willy Wonka movie they changed to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Yeah.  But it's the same movie.  Good answer, Jim.  Good answer.  Does someone really know the answer to that?  Because they are changing the names of the remakes.  That's what somebody said to me, so you know which one you're talking about.  Like, so you know, immediately you associate it with the new one.  Now, I loved, I don't know if it holds up to the, you know, the test of time, as we like  to say, but I loved the Poseidon Adventure when I was growing up.  It kind of doesn't hold up.  Oh, you saw it?  Yeah, I saw it pretty recently, within the last year. 
[00:40:30]  The special effects aren't very special.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it kind of looks silly.  No, what's really bad is the special effects in the original beat the television version  that just came out.  Yeah, they just can't afford, what it is, you just can't afford to pour money into  special effects on a television show.  Wait, did you ever see the 20-year, like, Poseidon Adventure, years later, they did  a sequel to it?  Oh, yeah.  Where Christopher Lee starred in it, and they were living, like, a lot of them were living  in the boat under the ocean. 
[00:41:00]  I don't know how they had oxygen and food.  Just squatting.  Are you kidding?  No, it was awful.  Like, they had an oxygen supply somehow.  They're like Katrina survivors in New York hotels.  And they were living.  Bastards, get out.  Oh, okay.  In the Poseidon.  I was going to say, they were living there 20 years later, but it was, the movie came out 20 years  later, but it picked up for them.  Yeah, but it picked up for them.  Right, right, right, right.  Maybe like 20 years later, it came out for them.  But I understand.  Yeah.  Well, I got to tell you, Poseidon Adventure, I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Yeah, it looks like it could be good.  Also, you have, you guys ever see The Hills Have Eyes? 
[00:41:30]  Yes, with Wes Craven film.  Yeah, they're remaking it, and apparently the version that they've been showing people  is so violent, this might end up NC-17.  That was the first rated R film I ever saw, The Hills Have Eyes.  Really?  On WHT, Wameco, it scared the shit out of me.  My buddy Bill D'Angelo, his father had Wameco, so I went to his house and watched it.  Yeah.  Apparently people are vomiting during screenings and everything.  It looks like it's going to be completely insane.  Has anyone seen the remake that just came out, that horror film, you know, he's calling  from in the house?  Oh, When a Stranger Calls.  When a Stranger Calls. 
[00:42:00]  Why remake it?  It did well at the box office.  But the whole movie leads up to that one thing.  I know.  He's calling from in the house, all right.  It was really a bad movie.  Yeah, one of my friends ended up seeing it and said, for a movie that has no blood,  you know, hardly any violence or any swearing, it's okay.  It's one of those creepy movies.  Yeah, we know.  He's calling from upstairs.  Now what?  Have you checked the children?  No, sir, you're up there.  I haven't.  Yeah, I did.  Okay, we'll be home about 10.  Right.  And that was the big surprise in the original movie that, you know, he's calling from in 
[00:42:30]  the house.  Now you know that's what this movie's all about.  Paul's coming from inside the house.  Get out of the house.  And that was scary.  That was scary at the time.  And then she flings the door open to leave the house.  And who was standing there?  The cop.  Yeah.  What's his name?  I don't know.  The fat guy that always played a cop.  I don't know.  Fat cop guy.  God damn it.  It was fat cop guy.  Now I gotta go.  I was so scared when I saw it when I was a kid.  I was so scared I dropped my daiquiri.  Speaking about another remake, I also tried the longest yard. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, Charles Durning.  The new one.  And?  I couldn't last more than 10 minutes.  Really?  That movie is so fucking bad.  I started getting really, really pissed off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I went and watched the original and said, okay, all is good with the world.  Yeah.  It's all they're doing is making bad remakes.  Stop making these PC comedies.  Bad remakes that all they do is make you want to rent the original. 
[00:43:30]  Here's another good remake that might come out.  Michael Mann is directing Miami Vice.  Oh, who's slated?  You got Colin Farrell as Sonny Crouch.  Oh, that's right.  I saw the-  And then you got Jamie Foxx as tough.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Jamie Foxx.  Get the fuck out of show business.  He's a good actor.  Shut up.  I hate Jamie Foxx.  He's like a triple threat.  He's good.  He's a singer.  An actor.  He put out a frigging album.  It went gold immediately.  Oh, everyone loves Jamie Foxx. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Not me.  He's a good actor.  Is that it, Ken?  Also, I mean, if you guys want to also talk about sequels you got coming out this year.  Yeah, you got a lot of sequels.  Okay.  What do we got?  You got Superman Returns.  Oh, yeah.  That looks good.  Bryan Singer's picking it up.  He dropped X-Men.  Went over, did that.  It looks like it could be good.  I mean, Superman looks a little funky.  The costume's a little different.  Well, look what they did with Batman when they finally-  You know, made another one of those.  They went completely different with that movie.  Made it so dark. 
[00:44:30]  I love the Batman movie that came out last year.  Yeah, Batman, but, I mean, Warner Brothers was really hyped that they actually had a decent  comic book movie for the first time in maybe 20 years.  Right.  And now they're saying Superman is going to be their new flagship comic book hero.  It's going to make the Batman movie look like crap.  It's going to be amazing.  They built a huge flying rig, so they're not doing all CGI.  They made a giant flying rig where they strap him in.  He can go in any direction, so they're going to be doing amazing wire work, and it could 
[00:45:00]  be the best comic book movie ever.  I just hate the Batman franchise because they got so many different guys.  You're just disconnected from it.  You don't give a shit.  It's just stupid.  Well, they started over, though.  It all started over.  Yeah, Batman started over, and it has potential now.  Yeah, it's really good.  Did you see that?  No, no, I haven't seen it.  It was really good.  Really good.  With Christian Bale?  Yep.  He was great.  He played Batman?  Yeah, he was great.  And Liam Neeson was great in that movie.  That whole movie was great.  Also, you got X-Men 3's coming out this year. 
[00:45:30]  I like the X-Men franchise.  And it's being called The Last Dance, being directed by Brett Ratner.  And it looks like...  Hey, Rat, you're directing a movie.  How does this guy know to talk about movies?  Yeah, how do you know?  Do you work in the business or so?  I'm a huge fan, especially with comic book movies.  I mean, that's my whole thing.  I make short films, and I've just been a huge fan.  I keep up on everything.  Didn't the Hulk stink?  I liked it.  The Hulk, you know, the problem with the Hulk was you had a really great comic book,  and it would never transfer over to film well, really. 
[00:46:00]  And Ang Lee directed Oakback Mountain, and he directed Hulk.  You know, he had to transfer...  It could have transferred over, though.  They just made the character look ridiculous.  Yeah, it was too cartoony looking.  It was too cartoony.  Like, keep it more, you know, human-like.  Yeah, well, that's how he's been looking in the comic books for a while, for the past,  like, ten years.  Oh, so they went with the comic book angle, basically.  I like the Lou Ferrigno version.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  You take the Lou Ferrigno version.  Get Lou Ferrigno.  Jazz that up a little bit.  I think you would have had a hit.  A nice green and bad hearing.  Huh?  Lou Ferrigno.  He was in the remake. 
[00:46:30]  He plays security guard.  Yeah, I hear that.  Yeah, but this new X-Men movie looks really good.  It looks like it's going to be dark, and it might be the end of the franchise, honestly.  Yeah?  It looks like...  It's called The Last Stand, officially.  Right.  Yeah, it's just trying to rope you.  And it looks like some characters are getting killed off.  You got Jean Grey coming back as Dark Phoenix.  Uh-huh.  So that's going to be really awesome.  You got...  You know, the entire cast is back.  You got some really cool characters.  You know Vinnie Jones?  Wow.  He plays a mute guy.  You know your shit.  He's playing Juggernaut.  And he's wearing fake rubber arms. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  So that he, you know, he looks enormous.  He looks like Popeye in the Robin Williams film.  Huh.  Just huge.  Hey, Ken, they're remaking the Warriors, right?  You know, I've heard about that for a long time, and there's nothing confirmed.  That can be interesting.  Now that they just released a DVD...  Right.  A lot of people are going to that, and they're becoming...  You got a lot of new fans, especially there's also a video game out.  Yeah, I know, yeah.  So a lot of people are fans of that, and I don't know if they're going to want to  mess with how big of a cult following it's getting, even now. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Hey, Ken, one last question.  You're really good.  We want you to call the show from time to time.  Yeah, I've been writing you guys emails.  I mean, anytime you want me to call in...  You're definitely an expert.  What's the best movie you've seen in the last year?  Best movie I've seen in the last year?  Oh, man.  Broke...  Broke...  No, it's not Broke Back.  King Kong?  That was my favorite.  King Kong, honestly, was really good.  But I'm going to have to say, honestly, probably actually Batman Begins.  I'm really upset that it didn't even get nominated for Best Picture just because it's a comic book 
[00:48:00]  movie.  Even if you're not a comic book movie, it would blow you away.  Did you see A History of Violence?  I loved A History of Violence, and it is a comic book movie, but it didn't get nominated for  Best Picture.  That was my favorite movie of the last year.  It was.  I loved how brutally honest it was with the violence, just not cutting away some of the best  deaths ever.  And William Hurt got nominated.  I think he might just pull it off.  He was unbelievable in that movie.  You know, another movie that was really good was Crash, and it deserves a shot, but I just  think it's going to fall behind Broke Back Mountain, which, you know, is only really going 
[00:48:30]  to win because it's...  Well, Hollywood loves those movies that have courage and...  Yeah.  It's not really.  I mean, they've been doing that type of film all over Europe for forever.  It's just America's behind the curve.  Stupid Europe.  Of course.  Stupid Europe.  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  No problem.  You were great.  Hold on a minute, all right?  Okay.  We're going to get your info.  Here's Ken right now.  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now!  He was well-informed, though.  He was.  Ted in New Orleans, what's up? 
[00:49:00]  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Just real quick, and I'll let you go.  The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the new one that they made, Tim Burton had never  seen the original.  He was just going off of the original screenplay.  That's why a lot of things were different.  Like, and I got to reach, because it's been a while since I've seen the first one.  I think in the first one, they had, like, geese or something in it, but in this  one, they had squirrels.  That's kind of like what the original screenplay was like.  So I guess, I mean, if you want to get technical on it, it was more true to form.  I don't know.  I guess it just depends on which one you like better.  It doesn't make sense they changed the name of the movie. 
[00:49:30]  That's all.  Actually, they didn't change it.  That was the original screenplay.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay.  I love it.  All right.  All right.  I got you something.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Bunch it out.  You know what I hate about Willy Wonka, the remake, whatever?  The Oompa Loompas were the same guy.  Yeah.  I didn't like the Oompa Loompas at all.  I thought they had some fun rhymes.  You don't like them in the original or the new one?  Or the new one.  It's creepy little things.  Doopity doo.  They have riddles.  You just don't like it because you're not good at riddles. 
[00:50:00]  That's what it is.  Give us a riddle if you're so good.  I'm not good at them.  Riddle me this, Jimmy.  I will give you five minutes to come up with a riddle.  Riddle man.  Cocky.  Calling him out on his riddling.  Anthony's riddling sucks a dick.  Let's go to Tony in Indiana.  Tony.  Yeah.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  I just was calling to report a wow that I actually saw yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon here in the heartland of Indiana.  And you have a wow sticker? 
[00:50:30]  Got a wow sticker.  Got it from a friend.  We both listened to the show.  And we thought we were kind of like the only two.  But I was in the straight lane.  And I had a car pull up on the left turning lane.  And there was a lefty car length ahead of him.  I was wondering what the deal was.  Look over.  Lovely young lady.  Pulled up her shirt and whipped out her lovely young boobies.  Not the most exciting phone call.  But what we get out of the phone call is that this wow thing really does work. 
[00:51:00]  It happens out there.  Make sure you get your wow stickers.  The address is up on opianthony.com.  Okay?  Exactly.  Yeah.  We'll do the Lazlo movie trailer to break.  That's a very good idea.  And Jimmy has a...  I have a riddle.  You wrote it already?  Yes.  As far as I did, I'm the riddle master.  That's why I was laughing through Tony's phone call.  You are good.  Because I saw you pick up your pencil and paper.  I'm a riddling goose.  Jim Norton has a riddle, everyone.  If two men die, one is 32, one is 37, neither having had been dead before, which one will 
[00:51:30]  make it to heaven?  Is that a riddle?  Yes, it is.  Oh, yeah.  I guess it is.  Uh, neither.  They're both faggots and will burn in hell.  Oh, no.  I don't...  I can't even guess.  Okay.  I'm trying.  You know what?  We'll open it up to the listeners after the break.  How's that?  All right.  We'll try to figure out the answer to Jim Norton's riddle.  And I know it's ridiculous. 
[00:52:00]  It's not...  Could one of the listeners get the answer?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, all right.  Unless you put on a think-write strip.  What?  That's where it kind of pulls your skull down and tape it to my ears.  Over your head.  I could really think.  I can't, Ann.  I look like I have the mumps.  Clear the line, Travis.  Clear the lines.  People are going to guess at Jim Norton's riddle.  Jesus.  And also, after the break, we give...  I like to see him dressing for the gig.  Hey, King of the Hill character. 
[00:52:30]  After the break, we've got to give props to an O&A pass.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Ooh.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  On this fine Whip-A-M-Out Wednesday.  A bunch of things to get to today. 
[00:53:00]  Should we answer the riddle, I guess?  No one's going to get it.  Somebody might get it.  All right.  What's the riddle again, Jimmy?  If two men are walking, thanks, sweetie, and one is 33 and one is 38, and they both  die, but the 38-year-old dies first, which one has a better chance of getting into heaven?  Let's go to Brad in Cleveland.  Brad, what's up?  All right.  The person that gets into heaven first would be the guy that died last because he would 
[00:53:30]  be able to fuck the first guy that died without any resistance.  No, that is a good guess, but that's incorrect.  Good guess?  That's a horrid guess.  Let's go to Book in Ohio.  Book.  Yeah.  I'm stuck.  Fuck it out.  Wow.  Oh, he didn't feel any confidence.  Andrew in Virginia Beach.  I'm going to go out on a limb here a little bit and read between the lines.  I'm saying they're both going to go.  Opie and Anthony are both going to go because Anthony's cock is going to be stuck in Opie's 
[00:54:00]  ass.  Easy.  Oh, I think he might be onto something, though.  No.  However, I wish that was the answer.  Let's go to Larry in Alabama.  Alabama, wow.  Larry.  Yeah, man, no problem.  It's simple.  Well, the 33-year-old goes first because he's white and the 38-year-old is black.  The black comes along and fucks everything up.  Larry's correct.  What?  How is Larry from Alabama correct? 
[00:54:30]  Alabama, wow.  The answer was the white one.  He's correct.  The white one.  You got to get in that Jim Norton kind of mind, that's all.  No, he got into Alabama's mind.  Good boy, Larry.  You got it.  I even wrote this in circle so you'd know.  W.  Wow.  I thought it was obvious, but apparently only Larry and me.  Good boy, Larry.  Good boy.  See you at the meeting.  See you at the meeting.  I was about to say that.  The mindset of the Alabama man.  All right.  I'm a good riddle writer, though. 
[00:55:00]  Let's move on to other things.  I guess we got to give one of our pests some props today.  Why?  Why not?  The ONA pests are fighting our battle every minute of every day.  It is a battle.  And it's a thankless job sometimes.  There are pests, it gets back to me, that are defending us on all sorts of sites, defending  us with the newspapers.  When we're done wrong by a TV station, they're flooding the TV station with their opinions and defending 
[00:55:30]  us.  And on camera.  They're just defending us all the time.  Yep.  And a lot of times it goes unnoticed.  It really does.  But we want to thank you guys.  Yes.  They're fighting battles on message boards we don't even know about.  Because people don't give the show its due.  No, not at all.  They try to rewrite history.  Right.  And the pests are out there keeping the record straight.  So we want to thank a guy named Tom Ferreira. 
[00:56:00]  F-E-R-R-E-I-R-A.  An ONA pest.  He's from North Conway, New Hampshire.  Ooh.  He has an email address.  Well.  It's in the magazine.  Yeah, that's true.  If you want to thank Tom for the fine job he did defending this program, it's workjob3jobwith2b's  at hotmail.com.  Be very nice to this guy because he's an ONA pest and he got the job done. 
[00:56:30]  Certainly.  And I know there's a lot of you guys out there fighting the battle every day.  Thank you for that as well.  Yes.  It's a letter to the editor in Entertainment Weekly, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  And it's under the title, Stern Warning.  I guess Entertainment Weekly was ranting and raving how Howard was doing a pretty good  job in the first few weeks of his show at the Little Doggy Company, okay?  Well, at least someone was listening.  And they were pointing out some of the fine bits he's done so far. 
[00:57:00]  Mm-hmm.  And Tom sent Entertainment Weekly straight.  Tom writes a letter to the editor.  We're here in the mail section, I guess, in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly.  Stern Warning.  I find it interesting that you chose to give Howard Stern an A- for his new stint on Sirius,  news and notes, including his use of the Pat O'Brien tape.  What you failed to mention is that Opie and Anthony on XM have been doing satellite radio  for nearly a year and a half and did a similar thing with the O'Brien tapes several months  ago.  O and A are the true pioneers of the medium, consistently coming up with a hilarious original 
[00:57:30]  show.  Give credit where it's due and put that overpaid, overrated hack in his rightful place.  There you go.  A nice letter to the editor.  And we did do a much better job with the Pat O'Brien tapes.  Not only that.  Our listeners did a much better job with the Pat O'Brien tapes doing their remixes.  And a lot of the remixes that the listeners did for this program that we did, what, eight  months ago easily?  Yeah.  Maybe longer at this point, ended up on his show in the exact form that was sent in to 
[00:58:00]  our show.  Well, here's the deal with the Pat O'Brien tapes.  We were playing them before we even were sure it was Pat O'Brien.  Remember, Steve got a hold of them from someone before they were really even online.  And we were playing them going, supposedly, this is Pat O'Brien.  And we had them, you know, days after I think they came out.  There was a funny one.  Someone did Pat O'Brien calling Terry Schiavo. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, can we get that?  She was just going, ah.  That one's great.  Can we get that one?  So here's a pass that got some huge exposure for the show in Entertainment Weekly.  And I thank Tom today.  It's a great letter to the editor, setting them straight.  Good job.  Here's the one Jimmy's talking about, the Pat O'Brien, Terry Schiavo.  Remix.  Listen to this.  Hey, it's me.  God, you're so fucking hot.  I want to fucking go crazy with this. 
[00:59:00]  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits.  If you agree with this, say yes.  But yes, being the best, I told you that you answer her.  God, I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you curse.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:59:30]  You couldn't hang the phone up.  Community came from Steve.  We had them less than 12 hours after they hit the web.  Yeah.  What a bad, dirty talker Pat O'Brien was.  I love him.  So we had a lot of fun with that.  That's good getting them a year after they're out and trying to make them sound fresh.  And then unfortunately, he gets all the credit for it, which is just unbelievable.  It just shows the media is just not on top of things whatsoever.  It's one thing to get the credit for it because of who you are, but it's another completely different thing to actually believe it and buy your own hype. 
[01:00:00]  So I guess the letter to the editor in Entertainment Weekly, the latest issue, really got under good old Howie Skin.  That got to him a little bit.  Good old Howie Skin.  Here we go again, ladies and gentlemen.  We will be spending the next 10 minutes trashing Howard Stern.  Here it is.  Go to Top Tracks if you don't want to hear this.  This segment is called, See if You Could Spot the Bullshit in Howard's Rant. 
[01:00:30]  Well, we need a sound effect then.  Can I go with the whammy?  I'll go with the whammy today.  That could be the worst noise ever.  Awful.  Let me know when you guys want me to hit that.  We've got to pick up on all the lies.  Yeah.  Howard Stern from yesterday.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul from Rhode Island.  Hit it.  Yeah.  By the way, a little trick.  We're going to tear down the fifth wall today. 
[01:01:00]  The tenth wall.  Well, it's the fifth wall today.  Very big room.  Howard knew exactly what this guy wanted to talk about.  He's using this guy as the good old setup to get into a little rant about your pals Opie  and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio.  So that's kind of a lie.  Huh?  That's kind of a lie.  Why?  I said hit it.  Making it sound like he's just going to the call.  Random call.  Like I'm going to just wing it.  I wonder what this guy wants to talk about.  At least we'll acknowledge we use you guys to set us up for some fine discussions and bits 
[01:01:30]  on this program.  But listen, Howie goes, let's go to Paul.  Let's see what he's talking about.  Great acting, Howard.  No wonder Hollywood doesn't want you.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul from Rhode Island.  Hey, Howard.  Hey, brother.  Hey, you guys are great.  I just want to let you know.  I was just going to be pointing out Howard's lies, but I'm a listener, too.  Yeah, let's hit the whammy on all lies, okay? 
[01:02:00]  You know what?  This might take more than ten minutes.  You got to think actual time, though, here.  And then we'll figure out the percentage of how long we actually spent talking about Howard  today, because they will point out that that's all we do, is talk about him.  So we'll even do the math for you.  So someone's on the clock.  How many total minutes we spent talking about Howard today?  Here we go.  Do you have a sound effect, too, over there?  Oh, you got your own? 
[01:02:30]  All right.  I got mine.  And, Jimmy, you don't have one.  I want a whammy.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul from Rhode Island.  Hey, Howard.  Hey, brother.  Hey, you guys are great.  All right.  That's one.  I just want to let you know, in Entertainment Weekly's Oscar edition of their magazine this  week, they printed some blurb about some show they have on XM calling you a hack and saying  they had the, what's his name, from the extra show, the guy with the answering machine. 
[01:03:00]  At this point, Howie's, like, really frustrated that the guy couldn't just spit it out so he  could get into his stupid rant.  I was actually going to give the caller.  Correct.  Why?  Because we did have it.  Huh?  Because we did have the tape.  But I felt it was a lie that he said some show on XM that he didn't know you.  Depending on him, maybe he didn't know you because he didn't even know people. 
[01:03:30]  No, the caller knows the show.  Howard knows the show.  It wasn't us.  It was a listener that called him a hack in this letter to, excuse me, Entertainment Weekly.  Can I be the whammy counter?  Can I keep count, Ope?  No, no.  But I want to keep count.  Nothing.  No, you're irresponsible.  You just sit there with your Breathe Right strip and shut up.  I can't breathe.  You look ridiculous.  They said you were a hack in some show on XM that's had it all before you. 
[01:04:00]  They did parodies of it before you.  Oh, probably Ope and Anthony who are dead.  Oh, probably Ope and Anthony.  Probably.  Probably Ope and Anthony.  Like Howard didn't have this right in front of him.  Like Bob a fucking boo.  He didn't say, Howard, you're mentioned in Entertainment Weekly.  Here it is.  Yeah.  That's what a producer does.  Probably.  I didn't even know that we were in Entertainment Weekly.  Someone had to hand this over to me and go, guess what?  You guys made Entertainment Weekly.  It was a really good letter to the editor. 
[01:04:30]  So he's bullshitting right there by going, oh, probably Ope and Anthony.  Maybe he didn't know.  He knows it's Ope and Anthony.  It was handed to him.  Maybe he thought it was XM Kids playing the tapes.  Yeah, probably Ope and Anthony.  No, he knows it was Ope and Anthony.  No one else on XM was playing those tapes.  Right.  He read the fucking letter before he went to this fucking call.  Before you.  No, probably Ope and Anthony who are desperately trying to get something going.  Listen, I wouldn't be surprised.  Desperately trying to get something going. 
[01:05:00]  Something going.  We're doing our radio show.  We're doing just fine.  And I guess part of this is hoping that it grows and gets bigger.  Hey, we're proven successful on satellite radio.  We're proven successful.  We've been here almost a year and a half.  We hate to admit this, but because we fucked up so bad, we only have a year-to-year contract.  Yeah.  So if we were sucking so bad, they would have got rid of us already.  That is a fact.  Yep. 
[01:05:30]  They could, you know, in a few more months, they could decide if they're going to pick up the third year.  So we'll see if we're still sucking three months from now, four months from now, okay?  Mm-hmm.  You know, we deal with facts in this show.  We'll admit we fucked up so bad that the only contract they would give us is year-to-year.  Yeah, we fucked up.  They don't have enough faith in us to just say, yeah, we'll give you a solid three years no matter what.  If you guys fuck up, we'll pay you out.  No, we'll go year-to-year with you boys.  That's what happened to us because we fucked up so bad.  But we turned the screws on the next one. 
[01:06:00]  So, I mean, I think we're quite successful.  They would not have picked up our contract for the second year that we're three or four months into already.  I wouldn't be surprised.  I mean, listen, XM's got to be reeling from what has occurred within the last couple of months.  No, we're not, Howard.  Reeling?  Once again, we'll deal with facts.  The Little Doggy Company had a great fourth quarter.  Absolutely.  And with all the hype, with Howard going to Satellite Radio, we knew they would have a great quarter. 
[01:06:30]  But guess what?  XM also had a great quarter.  Yep.  We did just fine.  Just fine.  We made our numbers and we did everything the company wanted to accomplish in the fourth quarter.  Even with Howie over there.  Even with Howie coming to Satellite Radio.  And what's happening now?  What happened?  Uh, I'm hearing, uh, it's tailing off now.  They had their big Christmas. 
[01:07:00]  They had the big Howard push.  And now, uh, subs are tailing off a little bit over there.  Yeah, the numbers are coming back to earth.  What happened?  We figure we, uh, we have to, you know, deal with the Howard factor for the first quarter of 2006.  And then it's going to be, it's going to be right back to where it was.  And that's, uh, us completely kicking their ass.  Months.  Uh, you know, Opie and Anthony are really nothing but Howard Stern imitators and, uh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that old gag, Howie.  We're nothing, but you know exactly, uh, who we are, right? 
[01:07:30]  Here's another, uh.  So I guess we did our job perfectly.  Here's another fact.  Us playing you on this program is giving you more listeners than you playing you on Sirius.  There you go.  Here's another little known fact.  Fact, we have a bigger audience than Howard.  Yeah.  And we will always have a bigger audience than Howard.  Fact.  We're nothing.  You lost well over 90% of your, uh, your, your listeners.  Mm-hmm.  Over 90% of your listeners you lost. 
[01:08:00]  Didn't come over.  Decided, I could live without this guy.  When we started on XM, we had no listeners.  We didn't go from a big platform.  None listeners.  We went from a platform of zero.  So every day we do this radio show and it grows, we're a huge success.  Right.  A huge success.  We were off the air for over two years.  We had nothing.  We had to start from ground zero.  You went from a huge number of listeners to maybe, I don't even think it's 10% of his listeners came over. 
[01:08:30]  So who's a success, Howie?  Who's a success?  Who's desperate?  Imitators and, um.  Imitators, yeah.  Really, shut up, hole!  When they came to it.  Yeah, they've done absolutely nothing to improve.  Holy shit, will you shut up, hole?  You haven't done shit on that show in 15 years.  She's gonna, she's gonna say something.  Just read the fucking news from your dunk booth.  The greatest line Jay Moore ever came up with for this fine program. 
[01:09:00]  The satellite when they came to it.  Yeah, they've done absolutely nothing to improve the fortunes of XM Radio.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  More bullshit.  We're gonna use Howard's math, because Howard does this stupid math.  He goes, all right, they had this many subscribers before I joined, and since I joined, they had this many,  so I'm responsible for every single subscription that came in, right?  That is absolutely the way he looks at it. 
[01:09:30]  That's the way I've seen it written.  That's Howie's math.  Yeah, Howie math.  That's what Howie does, his own math equation.  So we'll do the Howie math.  When we joined XM, it was a little over 2 million subscribers.  A little over 2 million subscribers.  To date, we're over 6 million.  So in a mere 16 months of broadcasting, we brought, you and I, Anthony, and a little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, it's all you two.  I'm just along for the ride.  Over 4 million subscribers. 
[01:10:00]  4 million subscribers.  And we're responsible for every single one of them, because that's how Howie does the math.  We use Howie math.  Who carried the 3, Robin.  Shut up.  And, Robin, just shut your trap.  You're the luckiest woman in broadcasting.  You know it.  Just read the AP copy from your dunk booth and shut the fuck up.  XM Radio.  The only thing XM has going for right now is General Motors.  And General Motors, you know, Sirius, lo and behold, now has a lot of cars signed up. 
[01:10:30]  And a lot of people who have XM in their cars are converting to Sirius, which is, by the way, a very easy conversion.  It's about 100 bucks.  That's not true, either.  Yeah, try to sell it.  To this day, we still have more car makers.  Try to sell the fact to yourself.  He's trying to convince himself, hey, a lot of people are converting.  No, they're not stupid.  You buy a General Motors car, XM is in there, factory installed, working beautifully, giving you all the variety of XM satellite radio and your pals O&A. 
[01:11:00]  And no one's converting over to that fucking behemoth awful units that they sell over there.  No one's doing that.  That's what you want to do.  Buy a new Escalade with the friggin' XM installed right there in a beautiful unit on your dash.  And then shove a goddamn cinder block with wires coming out of it on your console.  They did have a good commercial during the Super Bowl.  A big, big placement for Sirius when the Clydesdale is trying to pull it and the other two are pushing it. 
[01:11:30]  You know, this is...  I gotta tell you something here, too.  Remember when my car got broken in?  Yeah.  And they took my XM unit?  Yes.  There was a Sirius unit in my car on the dashboard, too.  They didn't touch it.  Not even the homeless.  You know why they didn't touch it?  The thing was so fucking big and clunky, they didn't know what to do with it.  They thought it was a CB radio.  They thought it was a CB radio going, what kind of street value does a CB radio have in this day and age?  But they did take my Sky-Fi. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  They broke the passenger window, took my Sky-Fi, and they left the Sirius unit.  And they're fans of this show right now.  Just sitting there like a big, stupid car-tumor.  That's what a Sirius unit is like.  Car-tumor.  Car-tumor.  I love how he says, because XM's got nothing going for it except the GM thing.  How about the portable units there, Howie?  You keep trying to tell yourself that Sirius doesn't have a portable unit because XMs don't work.  Tell yourself that.  Tell your listeners.  Maybe they'll buy that bit of bullshit, too. 
[01:12:30]  He's just a liar.  He's been lying through his entire career.  Fact of the matter is, XM is a satellite company that you can walk around with a little handheld portable unit and listen to live satellite broadcasts of programming.  That's right.  And you cannot do that with anything Sirius has.  That's right.  And we have the lead with the car company.  Yeah.  It's not even close.  It's not even close.  To sit there and make believe it's close on your show is just, you're just lying. 
[01:13:00]  You're lying to yourself.  You're lying to your fans.  And why do you think that is?  Why does Howard think that XM has more, he'll never say it, but facts are facts.  We got the better car deals.  We do.  More of them and the better car deals.  Why do you think that is?  Do you think it's just people walking in there and spinning a wheel or flipping a coin?  These car companies did their research and looked at who was the better company. 
[01:13:30]  The company that would be there and you'd still have programming coming out of the unit that's in your car in a few years because you didn't hemorrhage cash paying a fucking has-been.  Conversion, it's about a hundred bucks.  Well, not that they have you, too.  But, I mean, XM has got to be reeling.  I mean, they wanted me to go to XM, but they weren't willing to really make a big financial commitment.  And we say bravo to that, you ass. 
[01:14:00]  Because Sirius wanted us over there.  It happens when you're on broadcast radio, you're a very high-profile show, and a satellite approaches you.  One company doesn't approach you.  Both do.  And here's some honesty.  Of course XM wanted Howard for the right price.  For the right price.  For the right price, they want you, Howie.  But you went for the money, and that's what's going to kill you in the end.  Because you didn't consider everything.  You didn't consider the car deals.  You didn't consider the technology. 
[01:14:30]  And that's what's going to kill you in the end.  Congratulations on the great payday you decided to go for.  You decided to go for the money, and that's why you will rot and suffer in the end.  Of course XM wanted you, for the right price.  They weren't going to just throw all their money at you, and forget technology, and forget other programming.  Yeah.  They weren't going to do it.  I think half a billion could be better spent.  Yes, of course they wanted you.  But they have guys that figured out the numbers and said, yeah, it's worthwhile to the company if we pay this much, 
[01:15:00]  but it's not worth it if we have to pay that much.  Yep.  Of course.  It was a simple business decision.  You're not that great in XM's eyes.  Financial commitment to me or a firm commitment.  They wanted me to go there and be the paid help.  And just the way Viacom made billions off of me, they wanted me to go there.  Oh, poor Howard.  Poor Howie, the paid help.  Billions off of me. 
[01:15:30]  We know for a fact that Howard was making a minimum of $20 to $30 million a year for Infinity Broadcasting.  Poor Howie.  Wah, wah, wah.  Poor Howie, the paid help.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fucking ass.  I was the house nigger, Robin.  Poor Howie.  Yeah, we can all relate to you.  Shut up.  Your fans don't even believe you anymore.  The paid help.  Garen, I swear to you, he was making $20 to $30 million a year for Infinity Broadcasting. 
[01:16:00]  That's paid help?  That means it's easy because this is how it works in radio.  That means XM was easily going to offer him well more than $20 million a year.  Yeah.  That's paid help, Howie?  You're talking to people that have two, three jobs to make a living.  Make ends meet out there.  Wah, wah, wah.  Paid help.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm a black ninja, motherfucker. 
[01:16:30]  Jesus.  The devil.  Oh, God damn it.  This guy just gets under my fucking skin.  So congratulations on that, Howard.  Congratulations.  You're such a bullshit artist.  And I think people are starting to figure that out finally.  Finally.  And that's why we go down this road.  Because we'll be the ones to make sure everyone knows you're a fucking bullshit artist full of shit ass.  Someone's got to call him out.  And I saw you without your wig.  And it was short gray hair. 
[01:17:00]  Because I believe every dream I have is real.  Wow.  Just the way Viacom made billions off of me, they wanted me to go over there and thank them for it.  And I was quite honest.  I said, quite frankly, you guys got a lot of problems.  And they said, well, what problem?  Holy shit.  XM has no problems compared to the little doggy company.  What problems, Howard?  Problems.  We're about to hear what problems XM has.  Problems.  And they said, well, what problems do we have?  I said, every time I speak with you, you've got to go back to your boardroom, your corporate board, and get approval on it. 
[01:17:30]  And that's stupid.  Why?  That's stupid because you're spending huge amounts of money.  And that's dumb.  Why?  That's bad business.  Why?  Who shelled out a half a billion dollars at Sirius?  The janitor?  Yeah, right.  Who did you talk to?  Yeah.  Hey, can I work here?  Yeah, half a billion.  Don't tell the board.  Who, who.  Call me crazy, but I think when one person makes all the decisions in a company, that's kind of scary.  Yeah, a little bit.  But when you have a board that you can go to and go, all right, look, guys, you know, this is a huge decision. 
[01:18:00]  Let's think this through.  Yeah, yeah, call us crazy.  Call us crazy.  Approval on everything.  I'm not experiencing that with Sirius.  They seem to make a decision and then get things done.  Yeah, get things done.  Paying Howard.  That's all he really cares about.  No, it just showed the desperation of the company.  They had no choice.  You had them by the balls.  You know it.  They do make a decision, though.  Like, once somebody said, look, I want to waste $27 million, and then somebody looked up at a TV screen and saw Martha Stewart. 
[01:18:30]  They went, aha.  Ah.  Decision made.  They had no choice.  You had them by the balls, and now you're making believe you're one happy family over there.  You laughed at them and said, oh, look, we could just take them for everything they got.  Well, they were like, ha, ha, ha, don't worry about it.  They had a meeting in my apartment showing me why they're better, and they got this repeater and that repeater and all the kind of bullshit.  All kind of bullshit? 
[01:19:00]  You watch what those fucking repeaters do to your little company.  You watch what the repeaters will do to your company.  Money well spent repeaters, my friend.  Something the little doggy company didn't think about when they started this whole fucking satellite radio thing.  Which is why they're having such a problem with their handheld gear.  Repeaters and all the other bullshit, really?  Repeaters and all the other bullshit, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking liar.  Fucking liar.  And I said, I don't know what you're talking about.  You want to make a deal with me, make a deal. 
[01:19:30]  So they were kind of arrogant about it.  Not bad guys.  But they've got to be reeling.  I mean, what has happened within the last couple of months, within the last year, they've done market research that now, when people mention satellite radio, the first thing they mention is Sirius and Howard Stern.  Could be true.  Could be true.  I don't know.  I mean, if we're going to be honest here, it could be true.  But, I mean, with all the hype he had leaving, you know, regular radio, you would expect something like that.  You know, so you survive the hurricane that is Howie coming to satellite radio, and the hurricane passes, and then you see which company really is better. 
[01:20:00]  That's just how it's going to work.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know if it's true with that survey, but it could be.  He did get an incredible amount of exposure.  Right.  It used to be people would mention XM.  You know, it's just mind-blowing what our move to Sirius has done for this company.  And, quite frankly, it has been nothing short of extraordinary. 
[01:20:30]  So, you know, yeah, I guess I'm a worthless piece of garbage.  I'm talentless, but that's why XM shows up at every one of my events with little signs and holding them up and trying to get in on everything.  Did you hear that, Pess?  Yeah.  He's downplaying it.  It was such a little thing that happened.  He mentions it every time he mentions it.  Because we got under his skin.  Of course.  We have people over there.  They were beyond pissed off.  We wrecked little Howie's day when he was leaving regular radio. 
[01:21:00]  And it wasn't just a few Pess with a few little signs.  It was a whole big deal.  We asked the Pess to show up at this thing.  It was a cold, rainy day here in New York City.  They came out in droves.  There were hundreds of them.  They made local TV.  There's a video that is played on whackbag.com a lot.  It's someone's sig pic, I guess.  Yeah.  And it shows Howie turning the corner and his gay fucking double-decker bus waving.  And he didn't expect it.  He turned the corner and there were hundreds of Opie and Anthony fans with XM Satellite Radio Opie and Anthony signs. 
[01:21:30]  And he made that sound like there was a few.  Look at the video for yourself.  There was hundreds of people in that section alone.  And the street was deserted of other people.  It wasn't like there was a shitload of his fans.  They were on that one street.  But then once he turned that corner, nah, not the old days, is it?  Go to OpieandAnthony.com.  Go to Whackbag.com.  I mean, stickers and signs ended up everywhere that morning. 
[01:22:00]  Everywhere.  And the video was classic.  He turns the corner and he was like, holy shit, what is this?  You see him look right at it.  It was hundreds of our fans.  And then he goes on his show and makes believe, ah.  You know, and then a couple people are, you know, trying to wreck my day.  No, we wrecked your day.  We know it.  In on everything.  Ridiculous.  This show is a juggernaut.  This show has momentum.  This show has been everything innovative in the radio industry.  And now our channels are innovative. 
[01:22:30]  You know, our fans are being serviced in a way that no one else can do.  And quite frankly, eventually now there will be one satellite company.  One is going to have to dominate the market.  And that's why he's not burning the bridge with XM, by the way.  They're good people over there.  They're nice guys.  Yeah, it's because he doesn't have confidence in the company he signed with.  He's hoping.  Do you think that you guys have burned the bridge with Sirius?  I don't think so.  Business is business.  I'm kidding.  You're fucking flamethroted.  Business is business.  If you learn anything in radio, it's that money talks. 
[01:23:00]  If they see the opportunity to make money, people will hire people that had just shit on you.  Or you had just been shit on by.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  We got an interesting call.  We got an interesting call yesterday.  We can't get into it yet.  It's a little tease.  But we got an interesting call yesterday that kind of-  We get little calls.  ...kind of makes Anthony's point.  But we can't blow up our spot yet.  What?  No.  That's all I'm saying.  We'll tell you.  I mean- 
[01:23:30]  We'll tell you, Jimmy.  And we'll tell everybody else when the time is right.  Does it tie in with my riddle?  Huh?  Yeah.  Actually, it hinges on your riddle.  It's a perfect example of business is business.  Yep.  And all is forgotten when situations change a little bit.  A little bit.  And we'll have info on that.  You know, we're not trying to just hang you guys out to dry with that one.  We'll tell you.  Is black girl coming to work for this program?  We're almost done with this horse shit.  ...to dominate the market.  And I got news for you.  XM was way on its way to being the dominant one. 
[01:24:00]  Holy shit.  And we still are.  On its way.  We still are.  We are the dominant one.  We are.  And there's no-  There is no sign pointing to that changing.  There's nothing this guy is grabbing onto and saying.  There's no facts that show that that's going to change.  Here's the facts.  The little doggy company, the stock has drastically dropped since Howard has joined the company.  Okay?  Their stock is hovering in the fives, I think, today.  We're in the, what, mid-20s, I think? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Or somewhere in that range?  Yeah.  I don't want to misrepresent.  But still, that's a huge difference right there as far as the stock goes.  A lot of the companies saying that XM's a good buy as far as the stock market goes.  Even with the Howie factor, we have over 6 million subscribers.  They have what?  What are they up to?  Three.  About three?  Yeah.  All right.  And they still don't have a portable unit that gets satellite radio live.  We do.  Not only do we have three of them, in another month or two months, they're going to get 
[01:25:00]  smaller and better with MP3 capabilities.  Yep.  But I use my MiFi all the time in Manhattan with all these fucking large buildings.  I've never had a fucking problem.  And this isn't bullshit like, oh, yeah, we're just waiting until the technology is right.  This is stuff that is made.  It's ready to go out.  You know, next month they'll be, or in a couple of months, they'll be releasing these units.  We've seen them work.  The handheld units, the new ones, just amazing.  Uh-oh.  And they work, a lot of the times, off of things called repeaters. 
[01:25:30]  Whoopsie.  This just came across the wire.  Whoopsie.  Sirius to raise subscription rates?  Oh, look at that.  Looks like they've got to raise subscription rates they're starting to talk about.  Well, if so many people were signing up for Howie, why are they doing this?  Sirius has spent a fortune acquiring talent like Stern.  Some investors are starting to want to see some payback on their investment.  Yeah.  Yeah, Wall Street is very pissed off at the deal they made. 
[01:26:00]  And now they're talking about raising rates to make up some of the difference.  There you go.  Just coming in.  As we talk about this bullshit again.  Raise those rates.  All right, let's get through this.  We're almost done.  And now they're not.  The amount of subscribers coming in on a daily basis is nothing short of mind-blowing.  So what can I tell you?  You're going to read all kind of things about what a hack I am. 
[01:26:30]  And you're going to hear how everyone was the first and everyone was better than me.  But we all know the truth.  That's right.  What the truth is, we were on satellite first, you fucking idiot.  And we've done just fine, you idiot.  We never said that you didn't open doors.  And he wasn't the first real high-profile jock that got a name for himself.  He's brilliant at self-promotion.  You weren't always a hack.  Believe me, I was a huge fan back in the 80s, early 90s. 
[01:27:00]  But things change.  Things change.  And you can't change history, you idiot.  Just like those things ring true about you, you weren't the first on satellite radio.  It just didn't happen that way.  No matter how much you babble the bullshit, it's not going to change the way it really worked.  We were here before you on satellite, doing very well, talking about things that couldn't be talked about on regular radio while you sat there, 
[01:27:30]  giving your listeners, as you said, 10 years of subpar radio.  The one going down in the history books is this show.  No one else's.  And who cares what we do?  I don't doubt that, my friend.  Why are they constantly talking about you?  Oh, God, this Robin.  It'll go down in the history books, all right.  I don't doubt that, Howard.  You're absolutely right.  Is it going to be good?  I don't think so. 
[01:28:00]  I think it's going to be seen as one of the big failures in business, paying you that much money.  When they had so many other places, they needed to spend it.  It's called Jumping the Shark.  Yep.  My friend.  Remember?  Fonzie?  Yes.  And we'll go down in history for some of the fine things we've done with this show.  Why wasn't it Jumping the Chicken Stand?  Did he do that first?  I don't know.  At Arnold's?  It's just the Jumping the Shark moment.  Who's Fonzie on a motorcycle?  Sharks are dangerous, Anthony.  Call it that. 
[01:28:30]  Chickens aren't.  You're Fonzie and you're on a motorcycle.  Yeah, that's it.  And you're about to jump.  Over, Johnny.  Well, you're in midair right now.  You stink.  You're in midair.  We're seeing it.  You're Fonzie on the bike in midair in slow motion.  In slow motion.  With Richie and Laverne and Shirley's face in slow motion doing the arc.  And now we've got to wait until next week to see what happens.  Right.  That's what happened.  Regardless of what's underneath him, it doesn't matter.  Don't forget Potsy.  He's singing inside.  And Mrs.  Oh, yeah.  He was the crooner. 
[01:29:00]  What a douche.  That's a real risk I'm taking as a performer.  Potsy was a douche.  All right.  Hey, hey, Jimmy.  I backed up because as you guys know from yesterday's program especially, we love the holes on radio  shows.  So Howard's trying to make his points.  He's lying through his teeth.  Let's see what the hole has to add to the conversation.  Out in the history books is this show.  No one else's.  And who cares what we did?  Why are they constantly talking about you?  Yeah.  I mean, let's.  Because you made us shut up for five fucking years. 
[01:29:30]  That's why.  That's why we mention you now.  Because we can.  Because we're allowed to now.  And you know what's funny about that?  She asked that question as Howard is talking about Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  See, if it was no big deal, then you just wouldn't mention us.  No.  There's a million radio shows out there. 
[01:30:00]  And they're talking about him.  Howard.  They're talking about the show.  They're talking about him.  They're talking about the show.  They're talking about the show.  They're talking about us.  You're not talking about those other shows because they don't bother you.  Don't bother you.  They don't get under your skin.  They're not making your career and your life a living hell.  No.  And you have to acknowledge it now.  And you still do a horrendous job at it, by the way.  You don't have the fight left in yet.  Everyone knows it.  Go back in your production studio with Artie and Fred and re-record old bits.  That's the revolution in satellite radio. 
[01:30:30]  You have the opportunity to do a completely different, new, cutting-edge, topical,  program.  And the first fucking week you're on the air, you go into production studio and re-record  old bits.  There he is.  That's the fucking genius that is Howard Stern.  That's why the guy said you're a hack.  Yeah.  I mean, let's face it.  Everyone in the industry constantly talks about me. 
[01:31:00]  It's, it's, it's, there's one, there's one man and then there's everyone else.  So there you go.  And that's the truth.  That's, that's why we do this.  I don't want to be you.  There's one him.  You're an embarrassment to yourself.  You're an embarrassment to your own family.  You're an embarrassment to your own daughters.  I don't want to be you.  He's the only one that's going to make history.  I don't want to walk around in my fifties in hip hop gear, acting like I'm still hip  and relevant.  I do. 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to get my hair done at a parlor.  The parlor.  I don't want to, I don't want to go to a parlor to get my hair done and gossip with all  the old Bettys.  Curlers.  I'm not going to try to add hair as I lose hair.  I'm not going to get my nose redone, even though I don't do TV.  A little lipo for the neck.  I'm not going to get rid of my turkey neck whenever that happens.  It's not going to happen for at least another 10 years. 
[01:32:00]  We're younger, we're smarter, and we're better than you.  And you know it.  So continue getting your hair done at the parlor, you faggot.  The parlor.  And when you're not wearing your hip hop gear, you're going to wear a Boy Scout uniform?  Ugh.  Maybe he's just into scouting.  I don't understand why the anger.  I want to play a game afterwards.  It's a new radio game.  Who would you be if you could? 
[01:32:30]  The grease man.  I want to be just like my father.  Don Imus.  Very good.  And that's the truth.  And people don't like to talk about it, but that's the way it is.  Yeah.  Because your life is so great.  I want to be just like you.  I can't, you know, sometimes it's, you know, if you have to pull it, Dave Chappelle.  Someone's saying that.  Oh, he should have said, and I'm not going to go out with a girl 20 years younger than 
[01:33:00]  me.  Oh, wait a minute.  At least I have a real relationship, though.  I don't give a fuck about the age difference.  Yeah.  You want to talk about a guy that just went for some stupid arm candy.  She's, she's dumber than a box of rocks.  They interview her in these magazines.  She's like, oh, it's all about Howard.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I go to bed when he goes to bed.  Whatever he wants.  It's all about Howard.  She doesn't even have a fucking brain.  She doesn't have a brain in that head of hers.  You see her in that stupid commercial with her hands. 
[01:33:30]  That is the gayest thing ever.  And that proves Howard doesn't give a shit about his girlfriend because he would have  said, you know what?  You know, you are a good looking broad.  You know, you don't have to do this stupid commercial.  You look ridiculous.  But he can't even see past his own fucking self.  Good looking broad.  Should have used those words.  Girls like hearing this.  You sweet talk.  She's a good looking broad.  But that commercial, what is it for?  I don't even know.  I like a credit card.  And she sits there while someone's using the credit card in a store and a guy's hitting 
[01:34:00]  the drums and she's in the background making her hands go back and forth real fast.  Almost jazz handsy.  You want to talk about hacky and stupid and desperate for fame.  Your chick is desperate for fame if she's accepting gigs like that.  At least I have a real relationship.  It's not a phony, you know, I'll just get some hot broad to walk around with.  So, you know, not to pull a Dave Chappelle, it's almost hard to deal with the jealousy.  I mean, people are just so jealous and envious of what I've managed to do to the radio industry 
[01:34:30]  and how I've managed to change it.  And I don't just mean me.  I mean, you know, Robin and Artie and Fred.  Yeah.  Not Benji.  How about Jackie Martin?  I don't even know.  That's right.  You Robin, Fred and Gary, I think deserve it.  Absolutely.  What about Sal and Richard?  Well, I mean, they're newcomers.  If they get it, I better be fucking off.  You're getting it.  Well, you're doing a great job.  So the thing is that, you know.  Yeah.  What can I say?  There's a lot of excitement about our move. 
[01:35:00]  There was.  That's over, Johnny.  You did it.  You made the move.  The news wasn't in you going to satellite.  It was you leaving regular radio.  It wasn't big news, you going to satellite.  It was big news, you leaving regular radio.  And that's over.  And now where are the stories?  And we end this with thanking Tom once again for getting his letter in the Entertainment Weekly mail section  because it got under Howard's skin, obviously, because he had to spend some time on us yesterday.  Hey, how's that pay-per-view thing doing that he pumped out? 
[01:35:30]  I don't know.  Isn't there some kind of TV thing that used to be for free on E?  Yeah.  That he's now charging money for?  You don't hear him talk about that fucking flop, do you?  No, we give away a lot of stuff for free to our listeners.  We try, you know.  We definitely try to give away as much stuff for free.  But when it fails, just like everything else, when it fails in his career, he's had a lot of success, that's for sure.  But there have been a share of failures. 
[01:36:00]  It's always, he gets on and says, it's always been somebody else's fault.  This happened.  And I decided to pull the plug.  There's never been one thing that's failed because it was just a bad idea or done poorly.  Yeah.  That pay-per-view for what you used to be able to get free on a shit cable channel.  Right.  Wow, what a great idea that is.  Try to squeeze a few more bucks.  Yeah.  So we thank the PES today, the ONA PES.  They're doing their jobs every single day, fighting battles we don't even know about. 
[01:36:30]  And every once in a while, one pops up and is brought to our attention.  So, Tom, thank you so much for the letter that you sent in to Entertainment Weekly.  They printed it.  And we greatly appreciate that.  We definitely appreciate that.  How come nobody asked me who I wanted to be?  Who do you want to be, Jimmy?  I don't want to tell you now.  It's anticlimactic.  Let's say hi to Moore Cox.  Hey.  Jay Moore Cox.  Jay Moore Cox. 
[01:37:00]  A funny hysterical line yesterday.  You know, I called in like an hour ago.  I know.  And we spent too much time.  We promised we wouldn't spend too much time on that today.  Now the percentage went up.  The percentage went way up.  Oh, boy.  Way up.  The percentage is way up now.  How many minutes?  Communique from Hawk.  It was over 30 minutes.  I think we're talking about 12%, 13% of the show today now.  It'll be 12.5% of today's show.  But as far as the week goes, it'll still be way, way down.  Bring the average down.  Yeah.  The week will bring the average way, way down. 
[01:37:30]  So, what's up, Jay Moore?  You guys are the best.  You do the best radio.  So, hey, if you got it, if you got it, you know, people don't realize that this guy had a gag order on you guys for years.  You couldn't even say his goddamn initials.  So, there's a little pent-up anger when you see this guy lying.  That's what's amazing about that, because he tries to make believe he didn't do the gag order.  And it's like, ah, why are these guys talking about me?  Why?  We're getting some shit off our chest.  Yeah, sorry if we were gagged for five years and couldn't utter a word about you under threat of firing. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, if you were so great at radio, why didn't you just take us on head-to-head when you had the chance?  Yeah, instead of running to Mel.  Because you knew damn well you didn't have a shot.  You didn't have the fight left in yet.  Running to Mel Karmazin crying to shut us up.  Well, now you can't shut us up, and that's why we're talking about you.  That's the only reason.  I was there, I remember, and I would always try to break your ball by saying his name,  and you guys had to dump out until freaking Van Halen came on.  We didn't even dump out, because we're like, you know what, we're not dumping, and that's why they...  It was the guy in the dump room.  They actually hired guys in a dump room that was like a little closet, 
[01:38:30]  and then the program director and the general manager had their own dump buttons.  Yeah.  We refused to dump out of it.  That was the problem.  That's where Jimmy takes prostitutes, the dump room.  That's not true, Jimmy.  Dump room.  That was fucking in the dump room.  That's stereotypical and hurtful.  Yeah, and everyone knows it was the Ron and Fez office.  That's right, or the bathroom.  It may be even stereotypical, and I thought it was a little funnier than the reaction I got.  I did bend a girl over one time in the bathroom, and I remember Ops on the air going,  where's Jimmy?  And Jimmy was balls deep in a stripper. 
[01:39:00]  By the way, by the way, we do try to stick with the facts.  E-Rock just handed me something, and Jay, I think you'll find this interesting.  You might have been in studio this day back at the old...  Splitillustrated.com.  My article's up now.  We'll get to that in a second.  Hold on a minute.  We got audio of the actual gag order in progress.  All right.  Wow.  This is actual tape from our old show.  And this is where we couldn't say his name, and we're like, you know what?  What the fuck?  So, Anthony, actually, I think you lost your mind here and just started repeating his name 
[01:39:30]  over and over again.  Yeah.  Let's go to the audio from the old days.  But I want to be able to give my opinions on what Ant and I do, maybe the business in  general, maybe some of the other shows that are out there.  Right.  That's what I want to do.  I want to be able to react and speak my mind.  But when it comes to right...  The same freedoms that are given to those very shows, too, by the way.  And I want to play by the same rules.  Uh-huh.  I want to be able to mention that.  Right.  I want to be able to mention that. 
[01:40:00]  Why be singled out?  Yeah, we couldn't play by the same rules is what I'm getting at from this tape about...  And look at how we had to say other shows.  Other shows.  We mean that other show.  We couldn't believe that...  We mean the Howard Stern show.  We couldn't believe they were tying our hands behind our back.  Yeah.  Driving in today, I heard a loud two.  Why?  I don't know.  I just want to play by the same rules.  Yeah.  That was a dump.  Not even bashing.  But I guess we're so powerful that we have a whole different set of rules, Anthony. 
[01:40:30]  Not even...  And if you really think for a second about this whole thing, and there are people out  there that say, oh, there was never a gag order.  Why on earth would we talk like this if there wasn't a gag order?  Why would we be covering things up and skating the issue and not saying his name if there wasn't  a gag order in place?  And we said something in this tape they dumped out of, by the way.  You'll hear the show kind of jump, because when you dump, just to explain this for the 
[01:41:00]  newbies out there, in commercial radio, if you dump something on a radio show, you don't  just dump that word.  It takes like five, six, seven seconds of the show away.  So you'll hear something like, so I was in the store, and this guy...  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  So listen closely.  Not even bashing.  Just talking about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Now they dumped out.  That's how you won't hear that, because they've been dumped out of.  There you go.  Point made.  They dumped out.  Yeah.  All right, Ant. 
[01:41:30]  Let's go waste four hours.  We're going to have some fun.  We'll waste four more hours.  It can be great.  Yells or screams.  Might as well save your breath.  Shouldn't be any yelling.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Just saying the name.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Bubble Bowie.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Dun and Mike.  Dun and Mike.  Dun and Mike.  Stern.  Dun and Mike. 
[01:42:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, that's us.  Opie and Anthony.  Howard Stern.  Howard Howard Stern.  Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern.  How's that stacking up?  Can he dump out of it this?  Howard Stern.  Stern.  Howard Stern.  Are we on the air?  Howard Stern.  I don't know.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  I can't say anything more.  It's like a tongue twister.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Howard Stern.  Stern.  Stern.  Stern.  Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard.  Howard.  Oh, okay.  Good.  That made up for about a week.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Don Imus. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Stupid Ben laughing.  That's funny.  But you hear they're dumping, dumping, dumping.  They ran out of dump.  Then they ran out of dump and all the Howard Sterns got through.  That caused problems, too, back in the day.  Anyway, it's all about Jay Moore.  I'm sorry, Jay.  Oh, I don't care.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  Hawk.  So I hear, Jay, that off the subject, you're very pissed off today. 
[01:43:00]  No.  Something about the message boards?  Oh, no.  I just posted one thing calling a guy a moron.  I'm not mad at it.  I'm not mad.  I'm the happiest guy in the world.  Come on.  Oh, okay.  I thought you had a problem, just making sure you're all right.  No.  Some guy called me a worm and said that she had a big fat ass.  And I wrote, well, let her down easy about the big fat ass.  Douchebag.  You got to love the message board people, huh? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, he's like, I don't know.  That's a big fat ass.  Her ass is bigger.  I don't know.  I'm not mad at all.  I called because I downloaded that Japanese chick getting shit on last night.  Oh, yeah.  That is harsh.  You know, I thought I'd seen it all.  Like, I've seen chicks like guzzle jizz from a horse's cock.  Yep.  When I was with Patrice in Brazil.  I thought you were serious.  Wow.  Yeah.  I thought you were serious.  Was it this clip?  Where she's getting shit in the mouth? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And she fucking eats it.  And she chews it.  And swallows it.  And acts like.  And she looks into the camera.  And I thought to myself, there might be, like, men with guns, like, going, no, you're going  to eat shit or else we're going to fucking chop your head off like a snuff film.  But then she, like, she just goes back for more.  Like, she can't take it.  Yeah.  And what I want to know is, if you have any listeners that speak Japanese, when she's 
[01:44:30]  not screaming, if she yells anything, like, yum, or, you know, like, oh, she's got to  say something in Japanese in that fucking mess of a bridal gown covered in shit.  That's what she says.  Yeah.  No, actually, what she was saying, and I don't speak Japanese, but it was translated.  She was saying, tastes like chicken.  I like the, someone on Whack Bag said that the crinkle noise was the guy pissing at the 
[01:45:00]  same time.  Yeah.  Hitting the floor.  And then, like, halfway through, the guy gets completely grossed out and just fucking  jogs off of the set.  Did you see that at the end?  Is that what that noise is, Tinkle?  I didn't see the video.  Jimmy, you of all people.  I know.  I only saw, like, 30 seconds.  Child's play.  Oh, you got to see it.  It's so heinous.  I couldn't go full.  I just keep soft-irving it up.  Soft-irving it up.  I couldn't go full feature.  I just went with the preview.  I, that, that was just, I don't know.  And then he, then he just jogs off the set like a linebacker that tweaked a hammy. 
[01:45:30]  I need the subs.  Do you think that guy wanted to be an astronaut when he was, uh, young?  Growing up?  I think, I think you kind of always have to want to grow up to shit on Asian girls' faces.  No, he probably wanted to be an actor.  Like, you?  Yeah, John Woo film.  He saw Chow Yun Fat.  He's like, I could do that.  Next thing you know, he's taking a dump in some girl's mouth for 50 yen.  Or whatever they get paid.  Yeah, 50 yen.  What's 50 yen in American?  I don't know.  Hey, Jay, I got to take a leak really bad.  Go ahead.  I just called the, I'm a plug whore. 
[01:46:00]  I got a column up on, uh, sportsillustrated.com.  Oh, what is it about?  Jay's, uh, columns, I read them.  Very funny.  What's, uh, this one?  Thank you, Anthony.  I like them.  You're the reader of the group.  What's the, what's the latest column about?  Uh, my take on the Super Bowl.  I'm so tired of reading, like, Super Bowl recaps.  So mine's, like, my weird take of Aaron Neville's fucking shit.  One of the best, uh, Jay Moore Sports Illustrated columns I read was the website ones, where you  wrote a whole thing on how teams that stink, uh, you go to their websites and they cover 
[01:46:30]  up the fact that they're sucking ass that season by throwing in filler and trying to get  people, uh, excited about the team.  That was very well written.  And they have, like, the most expensive websites.  It's like Foundry without the porn.  I like, like, the Tampa Bay Double Rays.  It's big letters.  It says, watch it happen.  Give us a little something, give us a little something on the Super Bowl, Jay.  Without, uh, doing the whole column.  Oh, I, I kind of forget.  Well, they censored the Stones. 
[01:47:00]  That was ridiculous.  The Stones are all pissed off because they censored, uh, two of the songs.  Yeah, they brought, uh, they said to the Stones, saying, I, now I'm just one of your cocks.  And then I sit with my son watching the same channel and I'm watching commercials about  erectile dysfunction five times a night.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's what's so funny about America.  None of this shit makes sense.  Well, Mick said I'm one of your cocks.  What do they expect?  No, but it's, I, I once was one of your roosters.  I was your main rooster and I'm just one of your cocks. 
[01:47:30]  It's like actually, it's like actually a rooster.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was a little too close.  And then you make a dead man come.  They, they, they, they got to dump that.  Why?  I agree with that.  I, because I, look, there are, when you're doing the Superbowl and you say, I'm just another  one of your cocks.  There's certain times where they got to take a thing down.  That's, that makes sense.  That's almost like saying, Hey, I was with my black friend.  We saw some ghosts.  What do you think of the spooks?  It's like, it's a double entendre, but you can't certainly just can't do.  I'm not saying it's, it's, it's, it's lovely, but it's a reality. 
[01:48:00]  Take that censorship strip off of your nose.  No, no, no, but there's a reality to censorship.  Yes, Jack.  These are all blogs that Jimmy wrote on my ex-wife's MySpace page, by the way.  Oh, did you, did you like that?  I was surprised she actually kept it up.  Yeah.  What happened?  I helped his, uh, Nicole do, uh, her MySpace page and I wrote like just to show her how to  do it.  And she left it up.  Oh, really?  Very childish.  All right.  All right, Jay.  So we'll go to Sports Illustrated and read your latest column there.  Yeah, I'm just, I, I love you guys and I get a lot of shit from, uh, whackbaggers about 
[01:48:30]  not calling it enough.  And we all do.  I just want you to know, you know, 4.30 in the morning, I get up to take a nice deuce and  I go, you know what, I'm going to call these guys.  Hey, you know, actually, before you go, what do you think of the NHL, uh, scandal that's  starting to break?  I think it's great.  It's about time because hockey sucks, Opie, and I know you love it, but it's for fags.  I like the hockey, especially with the new rules.  Any real hockey scandals besides the lockout?  I mean, any, uh, kind of scandal? 
[01:49:00]  Because baseball's had its fair share of scandals.  Not really with hockey.  Football.  What do you think of Gretzky's wife, though?  What do you think's going on there?  I guess she came up with a lot of dough on her husband's team.  I don't want my kid to grow up saying, I can't play, I didn't bring my skates.  What kind of fucking sport is that?  You got to get ice, you got to get water, and then fucking freeze.  That's why the Canadians are, you know, as good as they are.  When you put it in those terms, it does sound like a very inconvenient game. 
[01:49:30]  It is kind of ridiculous.  It's not like, here's a ball, throw it.  It's like, wait, almost, well, he drowns, it's not ready yet.  But that's why all the Canadians play hockey.  They got the frozen water all over the place.  I think it's ridiculous if you have a kid in America, especially, you know, a little further south,  and you think your son has a chance of being a hockey star.  Yeah.  That's like, you got to be kidding.  Look, a hockey game score is like 2-1. 
[01:50:00]  If there was no goalies, it would be 10-9.  Yeah.  I played hockey growing up, and we had to go to a rink at like 3 in the morning to get ice time.  How do you ever get good at a sport when you can only get rink time at like 3 in the morning,  like once a week, when these Canadians are playing every single day of their lives?  Got a lake in their backyard.  Right.  Hey, Jimmy, are you performing anywhere coming up?  Oh, you know, it's funny you should ask.  Albany, February 24th, 25th.  I'm going to have my new, I have like a new thing.  It's a dancing extravaganza that I close with. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  Where I have showgirls.  I like that.  Yes.  You sing torch songs?  Yes.  It's a little, it's a number I, it's called Do the Ramsey, and we all put on cowboy hats,  choke ourselves.  God damn it with my hands.  Connor Pearson isn't dead, and I'm sitting here right next to the guy, and he's got fish in his diaper.  All right, I've got to go time my leak.  All right, guys.  God bless you.  Bye, Jay.  Jay, take it easy, man.  Who wants to have a leak off?  I will beat anyone right now.  I've got to take a leak.  I'm going to set the record for longest leak today.  Only if we can do it to the same Europe. 
[01:51:00]  A lot of water today.  Because I can know if you're cheating.  Give me the stopwatch.  No, you'll hear it hitting the water.  Ooh.  I'm going to go for, I'm going to try for two minutes straight.  Why don't you not do that?  I'm going to have to, though.  I hope you can't go.  My bladder's killing me.  I'm going to have to walk down the hall, like, hunched over.  I hope a stone comes out.  Ah.  By the way, as we end this segment.  Oh, what?  Come on.  I didn't get it.  I thought Keith Richard pissed a kidney stone.  What a fucking ass I am.  Oh. 
[01:51:30]  I'm not going to explain it.  I'll listen.  Catch it on the replay.  I was going to say I'll listen during the replay.  Just a little message to Howard as we go to break.  The fates.  Wait till you hear what XM does next.  Ooh.  Wait till you hear what XM does next.  Is this about playing my CD?  No.  No.  Of course not.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:52:00]  If you don't have a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com and we'll send some stickers out to you.  Or you can make the homemade wow signs if you're looking to see boobies on the highways.  All right?  The Pal Talk went down for their usual maintenance for a few minutes. 
[01:52:30]  When it comes back up, I will log back on.  So fear not.  Whip Them Out Wednesday and speaking of boobs, Rich Voss.  Hi, Rich.  How are you?  Nice segue.  I can't tell you how happy I am to see Norton here because I swore he was going to walk into that house on Dateline.  I was just sitting there going, Norton's coming in there.  Didn't a couple of the guys toward the end look like Jimmy?  Like the one guy with the hat that came in, he was kind of blocking his face from the light.  Yeah.  I was coming in.  I was like, oh my God, that looked like Jimmy.  Jimmy just would have looked at it as another TV credit. 
[01:53:00]  We got to get back to the Dateline Internet Predators Episode 3 audio, by the way.  Really fast, I set the bar.  The new contest, the league contest.  Oh, this is unbeatable.  I challenge anyone around here to beat, well, yeah, to take me on.  I thought I had to take a real wicked piss when I went in there.  I made it for 30 seconds.  And Ope just kept going and going and going.  And he's now got the benchmark. 
[01:53:30]  And I wasn't slowing down on purpose, by the way.  No.  I was just letting it go.  I made it to a minute, 56 seconds straight.  A one minute, 56 second long piss.  That is the record.  The current record.  When I'm pissing, I look at the bubbles going, if I just had $1,000 for each bubble that hits  there, I could retire.  And when I fill up the toilet with bubbles, it's just like a great...  You know what's the best piss I said yesterday?  Hold on a minute.  Shrinking soap?  Yeah, hold on.  You can't just quickly move on to the next dumb thought.  Okay, your daydream makes me sick. 
[01:54:00]  I hope you're not trying out new material.  Not at all.  This is a very powerful, professional radio show.  Do you think I would do...  I don't do material.  I'm just trying...  I don't even do material when I work.  Why would you wish that each bubble was...  What?  I don't know.  It's just a daydream.  But do you know what the second best piss is?  And this is...  And I thought of this yesterday.  Second.  No.  The first one's when you get up.  The first one's when you get up.  But after you, like, jack off, that piss that cleans out the last part of the jizz in you...  Oh.  Oh, it's... 
[01:54:30]  No, because it comes out like a hydra.  Yeah, and it's got a little...  Big, friggin' 20 heads on this thing.  Yeah.  It's got a little burn, and you don't have the clap.  Yeah, that's great.  That's just wonderful.  Thank God we're on satellite radio.  We can say whatever we want.  Yeah.  We're using this new technology to the...  There are certain things you just couldn't talk about before, and that's one of them,  where it goes out in two directions, and you don't know which stream to keep in the  toilet, and which one to let hit the vanity.  Absolutely.  It goes out in two streams.  You get your money back. 
[01:55:00]  I just don't know what to do.  Do I aim for the toilet, or R. Kelly's little chick?  No.  You take your right hand, and you slap your penis really hard, and that'll open up  everything, and it'll turn into one stream.  Or just to discipline it.  Sometimes you have to show your penis who's boss.  Also, the little surprise after you've been amorous with a girl, if I may say so, if I  may use that language instead of the filthy, dirty boss language, and then you put your  clothes on, and then you go to take your underwear down, and you forget, and quickly 
[01:55:30]  you pull it down fast, and it's kind of glued to the tip, and it hurts.  It's like it's ripping something out.  You got to jostle.  I always do a jostle.  You do a jostle?  I'll grab the underwear, and I'll kind of pull and yank my ass back.  Yeah, and that's because you got to do the jostle, but sometimes you forget.  It's like your cock fell asleep on the couch, and you have to lift it off the plastic.  Do you clean yours?  Like, after you pee, do you hold a tissue or a napkin and clean it so you don't get  pee stains in your underwear? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, there's tissues there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to use that.  I'd rather just put it in a young lady's mouth and say, take care of this, with your  toots.  I'm sure she appreciates everything up to the toots.  Of course they do.  Dateline Internet Predators episode three.  Hi, Predator.  Yesterday, we listened to the audio of Kinky Man.  We're going to move right on today with an actor.  This guy was an actor in it?  Well, he said he was an actor, but they questioned him on it, and all they could really dig up  was that he was an extra in Godzilla. 
[01:56:30]  And they went to a clip of Godzilla, and I'm like, cool, we're going to get to see this  guy.  You just see Godzilla and like a thousand people running.  And do they have to circle which one he was?  No, they couldn't even get that.  They couldn't even get that much out of it.  Why would they show a Godzilla clip?  How did he go from being in a blockbuster motion picture?  They didn't say that.  Yeah.  And he was just kind of an extra.  He was an extra.  I can see if Tobey Maguire walked in.  Yeah.  This is the greatest show on TV.  We're hoping to have like 10 episodes in the can, because the Predators are kind of 
[01:57:00]  on to Dateline at this point.  You got to think, because now they're arresting him and everything.  You know something?  They've got to get dumber and dumber with each one, because now it's got to be all around  the, if I may say, Predator community.  Yes.  Is that the proper terminology?  I don't want to offend anybody.  The Predator community that this is happening.  So I can't see him really doing too many more of these and getting 50 people over the course  of three days is what they arrested.  50 people over the course of three days. 
[01:57:30]  I think they could do it just in every town without the cops and just lock up Predators.  I mean, any town they go in.  You kind of need the cops there to lock people up.  No, I'm saying without the cameras, so it doesn't get, you know, too.  Oh, but that's not fun.  They do that, I'm sure.  In every town, yeah.  Yeah, they do things.  I don't know every town, but they do it.  Well, you know what I mean.  Right.  Sure.  So we listen to the actor.  He goes into the house.  That's a setup, obviously.  Uh-huh.  And the little fella or little girl, I don't know which one's going to be in this case.  It was a girl doing both parts.  She was the decoy, and she's very good. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  She could sound like a little girl or a little boy.  Yeah.  She's well-rounded, by the way.  That's well-rounded.  Could you hear the anger in her voice when she found out, this guy was in Godzilla, and  she's got to play this dumb role?  Godzilla.  Who?  Who?  Godzilla.  Godzilla.  God damn it.  Give me a pen.  I've got to write all these down.  Who's Godzilla?  I love laughing about this later.  Godzilla.  It's an old movie.  It's Gone with the Zilla.  We love to write them down.  Kling-clong.  Instead of Godzilla, it's Gon-zilla. 
[01:58:30]  Gon-zilla.  I love laughing about this stuff later, so I want to keep track.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you for many laughs in my apartment.  Store-closed Godzilla.  All right.  Here's the actor.  He gets quite the surprise when the decoy doesn't walk out.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you?  You have a seat right there.  Instead, he meets me.  And remember, none of the men know they're being recorded on hidden camera.  Chris? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  He's 34-year-old Chris Moore, and like so many of the men I confront, he tries to lie about  how old he thinks the boy is.  I thought he was 18.  He's told me.  You want to try again?  Uh, if he's young, I apologize.  All right.  You're free to go.  Do you know what would be really funny is if they guess lower?  How old do you think he is?  Two? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, shoot.  This is the greatest show on TV.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  Certainly.  Now that we got the actor crying here, huh?  What do you have to say for yourself?  I'm ashamed.  I don't know.  I just wasn't thinking right, and I feel terrified.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is Opie meeting with E-Rock after the show.  Or if he said, how do you feel?  I wish you were younger. 
[02:00:00]  Can I still bang him?  Yeah.  When all this is done, do I still get down to sex?  That's why he's really crying.  You mean I don't get the young ass?  Fucking.  I feel terrified.  And this wasn't seriously the first time.  And I knew I was taking a huge risk.  So you knew what you were doing was wrong?  Yeah.  And I...  It becomes a tearful performance for an actor who says he's played many roles. 
[02:00:30]  Which is, I've worked in, uh, background movies.  He was, uh...  In television.  In television.  And what do you do for movies in television?  Background standing work.  Last comic.  Like, the matter?  Yeah.  I played Lenny Bruce once.  What would I have seen you in?  I've never been kissed.  Uh, Pearl Harbor.  How did he get from being a stand-in on blockbuster movies to standing in our kitchen?  Why did you do it then?  Tell me what was going on in your mind.  I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  You know how people will react when they see this.  I mean, this does not look good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You think?  I try to do the right thing, but I'm weak.  I'm too fucking weak.  Do you hear how that guy's crying?  Every girl that leaves his house walks out with that same basic crying.  Yeah.  Mommy!  What did I do? 
[02:01:30]  He's actually, you know, he's a method actor, and he's working on a film called The Memory  Repressor.  He was in Pearl Harbor?  Yes.  As an extra, I guess.  An extra in Pearl Harbor.  There were a million extras in that.  I was the guy that was running away from the blast.  I'm the guy who did this.  He throws his arms up and runs in a circle.  I'm the guy that grabbed a little boy when the bomb went off.  Yes.  A little Hawaiian child.  A little Hawaiian.  And I hit him in my underpants.  He said, like, how do you get into these movies?  Like, how? 
[02:02:00]  He signed his name.  That's how we got in.  Yeah.  All right.  We move on.  Well, you know what?  It's funny.  He's an extra, so I guess he's used to five and under.  That's a good line.  Oh, but it's so inside.  Yeah.  That's a good industry line, man.  Someone's driving right now.  Yes.  That Jim.  He's an insider.  Some guy in Hollywood Hills laughing and laughing.  Da-da-da.  Ha-ha.  I'm ready for...  And all of Alabama going, what the fuck?  Oh, no.  How about all of America except for two guys in la-la land, as I call it.  Ha-ha. 
[02:02:30]  I'm kidding, boys.  Dateline, Internet Predators, episode three.  We meet biotech musician.  And it doesn't look good for this next guy, either.  He's 56-year-old Stephen Coates, who goes by the screen name M4 Pixeline.  He works in the biotech industry and is a songwriter on the side.  He even has a website where he sells his work.  A songwriter on the side.  That's great.  What song is this guy?  When I'm lying here in bed, I find it hard to believe that you're seven. 
[02:03:00]  She was just nine.  You know what I mean.  Three candles.  Thank you, Yoshi, for a similar-to-yoshi joke.  Oh, wait.  That's good. 
[02:03:30]  Let him come.  Let him roll.  Too heinous.  Is that too heinous?  No.  No.  What are you kidding?  Everything's fair game on this show.  This is almost so wide open, I'm, like, mentally salivating and coming up with nothing.  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  Damn songwriter.  This clip's great.  He's requesting anal.  I mean...  Is this the songwriter?  Oh.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  It doesn't get much better than this.  He goes on to explain to the girl he thinks is a 13-year-old virgin that they should have  oral sex because intercourse is a big step.  And he adds, sometimes people just do anal sex first.  Sometimes...  He's just filling her mind with this, hey, you know, if you're a virgin, sometimes they  just do the anal first.  Are you kidding me?  He's trying to show he's a nice guy.  Like, hey, look, I don't want...  That's personal.  I'll just put it in your shitter than your mouth.  You'll take your virginity away from you. 
[02:04:30]  You won't sit down until you're 18, but...  You should really save that for someone special.  Right.  I'll just fuck your ass.  I can't do anal, sir.  All right, put this mud in your pussy.  Everyone knows that's the wedding hole.  I'm still a wedding hole.  You're a special girl, and we're going to save that.  The wedding hole.  It's good, right?  Thanks.  Then, you're still a virgin.  And then he starts asking about her body.  How tall is she?  How big are her breasts?  And one of the most frequently asked questions, if she has hair in private places. 
[02:05:00]  When the decoy says, not really, the 56-year-old says, that's terribly sexy.  He raises a good point.  Well, I just prefer to have been shaved as opposed to not having showed up yet.  Oh, I want to fuck your ass.  I want to fuck your ass.  Oh, she's three.  Oh, she's three?  No. 
[02:05:30]  She had no pubic hair.  Yesterday, you were only seven.  They just are the worst.  I'm not the one doing it.  I'm just singing about it.  He's the songwriter.  I'm setting your examples.  Oh, there you go.  I don't mind that you're doing it.  You're just like, he's the songwriter.  All right, here we go.  Another clip from biotech musician. 
[02:06:00]  He tells her he's trying to be discreet so his wife and son don't find out.  Oh.  And here he is, humming in the door.  What's in the bag?  Oh, nothing really.  It appears our songwriter has brought along some of his own work, but he quickly realizes he won't be playing it for a child.  Good evening.  How are you?  Oh, okay.  I guess you have a seat on the stool there, please.  Yeah, I get the fucker first.  Soon, we'll be singing a different tune.  Ah, singing a different tune. 
[02:06:30]  This reporter is the fucking worst.  Smarmy.  Oh my God, should he be beaten?  I hope he gets busted in a sting of some sort.  Oh, would that be great?  Let's go to, uh...  I'm walking in this house...  Yes.  ...to find a 13-year-old.  I'm going to scar you emotionally.  Let's go to Dr. D.  Dr. D.  Well, I'm ass-raping this girl in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What happened he's dead?  He's doing Springsteen. 
[02:07:00]  Girl, you'll be a woman in 15 years.  Will you still need me?  Will you still feed me?  Since you're only four.  My girl's only nine.  Mom, mom. 
[02:07:30]  Let's go to Anthony in Yonkers.  Anthony.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I got a little, uh, title for you.  Mm-hmm.  How about...  Six Little Candles.  Ooh.  Wasn't that done already?  Of course it was, but with less candles.  You non-paying attention ass.  Let's go to Seth.  I'm doubling my candles.  Seth in Boston.  Hey, it's Seth in Boston.  What's up?  How about Benny Mardone?  She's just 13 years old. 
[02:08:00]  Leave her alone, they said.  Way to deliver it.  Wow.  Bye.  Like a court transcript.  Yeah.  Let's go to a Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo?  Oh, Magoo.  How you doing, boys?  The cherry's gonna pop.  Diddy bop.  I heard cherry's gonna pop.  Oh, here we go.  Not bad.  One last clip from Biotech Musician.  I want to see what's in your pocket.  Oh, this, just this CD.  Of what?  May I see it?  This is the songs I have. 
[02:08:30]  Songs?  Yes.  And what are you doing?  Oh.  He put a CD of his songs.  Of his songs.  That's going to woo her.  He made a CD for her.  This is a song called Keep This Between Us or I'll Kill the Dog.  Mister, can you please play If I Don't Fuck It, I Won't See Tomorrow?  Let's go to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's only two or three. 
[02:09:00]  Winger.  Very good, Jeff.  All right.  And what are you doing here, Stephen?  Um, I was doing something that I shouldn't be.  And what is it?  Why don't you tell me?  Writing songs.  I just want to go, okay?  Please?  What are you doing here trying to meet a girl who told you she was 13 years old, Stephen?  I, I've never done such a thing and I didn't want to do it and-  Why did you do it then? 
[02:09:30]  Because I just, I, I'm stupid.  I'm absolutely, utterly, completely stupid.  Well, they called it puppy love, even though I'm 33.  I can't really know.  Put your head down in your crib.  Burp you over my shoulder.  Oh, it's raining, kids. 
[02:10:00]  Hallelujah, it's raining, kids.  Puggle rapist.  Puggle rapist.  And by your three-year-old, give her a cock to suck.  All right.  All right.  That's got to get completely graphic.  Yeah, we're trying to keep it right on the edge.  Jesus.  Let's go to-  To all the girls I have a love to are four.  Let's go to Will in Boston.  Will?  Hey, you don't even have to change the words.  Love hurts.  By Nazareth. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  Want to move on to the next guy?  How did none of these guys walk out with Lisa Peets in her hand to cover him, you know?  Hey, delivery.  And then, all right, so what the fuck?  One bad one out of seven so far.  I thought you were serious.  Yeah, no, they just-  Up.  But they have transcripts of their-  Yeah.  Photos walled right there, you're arrested from the transcripts.  All right, let's go to-  When a man loves an infant. 
[02:11:00]  Ooh, baby, baby.  All right, let's go on to South Bay Guy.  South Bay Guy.  This guy got busted by perv justice before?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't learn.  Here comes South Bay Guy 310.  A year ago, he was caught talking to a perverted justice volunteer who was posing as a 12-year-old.  His name and other personal information were posted once before on perverted justice's website, 
[02:11:30]  which usually means his employer, family, and neighbors were contacted by perverted justice members  and directed to his sexually charged chat log.  But it seems he didn't get the message.  Here he is back online with the same screen name, South Bay Guy 310.  Three minutes into the chat, he asks the girl if she's a virgin.  Then he wants to know if she's ever had sex with a guy from online before.  The girl says, yeah.  And so he asks, do you want to meet and see what's up? 
[02:12:00]  That all happens in less than eight minutes from the start of the chat.  And as you'll hear, it gets more disgusting.  Can I videotape us?  Are you, like, going to sell it?  No.  LOL.  I don't got a cam, though.  I want to watch it and masturbate to it.  Jesus.  I want to watch it and...  Oh, crap.  South Bay 310, he likes it.  That's his numbers.  Between 3 and 10. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  South Bay 309 is an upstanding citizen.  South Bay 310 will fuck anything.  Just as he pulls up, that's him driving by, there's another man being arrested outside.  Yeah, get this.  He calls the decoy to find out what's going on.  Del quickly makes up a story saying her neighbor was arrested for dealing drugs.  Amazingly, the police activity isn't enough to stop him.  That's him coming in the door.  32-year-old Keith Williams.  He's got the alcohol and the camera. 
[02:13:00]  He doesn't seem all that surprised to see me.  You know what?  I know.  Sit down, please.  Okay.  Please sit down.  Relax.  Actually, I'm not relaxed.  I'm not going to give an interview.  You're not going to give an interview?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't think it's in my best interest.  But he proceeds to give the interview.  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  I'm stupid.  I knew it better when I drove by. 
[02:13:30]  I just knew it better.  Why did you do it anyway?  I wasn't going to...  I don't know.  I just...  Because I enjoy having sex with young girls.  I just...  So you're bored?  You're going to come over and try and have sex with a 13-year-old girl?  No.  Like a man?  Yeah.  Shouting that down?  I don't know what I was going to do.  But in his chat, he makes what he was going to do pretty clear.  You want to take pictures of her?  Take naked pictures of her, you see?  Oh, dude, I don't know.  I'm not denying anything I said.  It's all right there. 
[02:14:00]  Did you ever hear of a group called Perverted Justice?  Yes, I have.  I know about that.  I'm not sure if I know how old they are.  You posted here after talking to a girl who said she was 12.  Oh, God.  And you know it's not the first time?  No.  They've had it done it five, ten times already.  65, seven-year-old man walking in for...  They're just that disgusting.  Boss, you got a couple daughters.  How do you protect them from this type of thing?  Well, they can't read, so they don't go online. 
[02:14:30]  Do you watch their activity online?  No, but they're not allowed to go into chat rooms, you know?  Yeah, but you know what?  I know parents that say the same crap, but then their kids are still in the rooms, and this is what's going on in schools these days.  That, you know, the kids get home from school, and they're just on AOL or what have you, IMing like crazy, you know, all their friends all over the place.  It's just, you know what it is?  You can't really police it.  And a kid that just goes to school with a skirt, whatever, you know, trying to be in fashion. 
[02:15:00]  Some fucking predator's wet dream, you know what I mean?  It's just, anywhere they go, I mean, you know, you try to protect them, you know?  You just say you can't go into chat rooms.  You know, you can't talk to strangers.  There's no black kids.  You just try to get as much.  I think, Mike, you know what it is?  I don't know.  Just the fact that you said she goes to school with a skirt because she wants to be in fashion shows what an old man you are.  Yeah.  She wants to be in fashion.  Yeah, you know.  No one says that.  Send them in a gunny sack.  In fashion.  You sent your kids to school in gunny sacks. 
[02:15:30]  I can't wait to have kids.  I'll put her in a miniskirt.  Why not?  Let her learn for herself.  Toughen up, baby.  Hey, we've got to interrupt this for a second.  One of my favorite people is on the line right now.  Harvey.  Hey.  Harvey Walden, everyone, from Celebrity Fit Club.  Ooh.  My favorite show on TV right now.  Yes.  It better be.  Outstanding.  That and Flavor of Love with Flavor Flav.  I can't get enough of the celebrity reality shows.  Yeah, me either. 
[02:16:00]  I know the feeling.  Harvey's like the drill instructor on Celebrity Fit Club and, you know, yells and screams and tries to beat these people up a bit.  Gives it to him straight.  Doesn't hold back.  Doesn't pull any punches.  When Fatty gets up in front of him and starts mouthing off, he tells them what it's all about.  I like that.  Yeah.  You're a professional drill instructor.  You worked at Paris Island, right?  Yes, sir.  Weapons expert, has black belts for various types of martial arts, played semi-pro American football as a running back for the U.K.'s London Mets. 
[02:16:30]  Damn right.  You weren't good enough, huh, for the U.K.'s, the NFL.  What happened there?  Yeah, what happened there?  It was impressive until that point.  Took some shrapnel.  I had a bad hair day.  Ended his career.  Had a bad knee.  What happened?  But he's a star on TV now.  And I love when you just give these celebrities shit.  I love it.  Yeah, I love it, too.  Well, they come up with a lot of excuses.  Yeah.  And you're not one for taking excuses.  No, not at all.  I'm not there to pamper their Hollywood asses, so I call it like I see it. 
[02:17:00]  They'll thin out those fat asses.  How bad do you want to smack Ant in the face?  Oh, shit.  Don't you know, man?  Goddamn.  I did a show with him.  First of all, his hairdo now.  He's got some new weave or plugs.  He gets more hair every week.  They're trying to lose weight, and he's gaining hair.  That's right.  Voss was on a show with Ant.  I got to be honest.  They wanted Ant on this program.  I can't stand the guy.  I think he kind of wrecks the show.  I love the show, except for when he talks, and he's all cocky and stuff. 
[02:17:30]  And it looks like the guy can't even do 10 push-ups.  I'm telling you.  I think he's more cocky after the show's over.  No, shit.  You don't have to worry about Ant.  Pretty soon, he'll be on Dateline.  He is the worst.  He really is.  He gets cocky, and he's looking at these celebrities, real celebrities that have real credits, and he's  talking down to him.  It's like, what the fuck have you done in your career?  You're talking to one of the Cosby kids like she's nothing.  Personally, I don't like her on the show.  But she's got one of the most successful sitcoms ever.  Ever.  Yeah.  And she does have an attitude. 
[02:18:00]  She's just walking her way through the show.  She hates that she's on Celebrity Fit Club.  She thought it was going to be something else.  Right, Harvey?  Oh, yeah.  She thought she was at a spa for the next 100 days, I tell you.  She's been a pain in the ass the whole way through.  Yeah, because they've got to do some things, and she doesn't even try whatsoever.  No effort whatsoever.  No.  But you know, strange enough, she does lose the weight.  But I tell you, I don't know.  She must be freaking fast in every goddamn week or so.  Yeah.  My favorite that you ever laid into a celebrity was, Jesus Christ. 
[02:18:30]  Wendy?  No, what's his name?  Oh, Willie Ains.  No, actually, it was shit.  Karen Carpenter?  His daughter.  Oh.  Oh, Mia.  Mia.  Mia is her name.  Oh, yeah.  Mia Tyler.  Yeah, you guys used to go at it.  Oh, my God.  Because she just had this attitude like, I'm sexy.  Yeah.  You could be 300 pounds and be sexy.  And we played those clips on the show, and we're saying, no, you can't be.  You could be attractive to a very small group of sickos who are into that kind of shit. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  But you're not walking down the street, and people aren't going, you know, even though  she's 300 pounds, that is sexy.  Yeah.  No.  She said her husband would love her at 600 pounds.  You know they broke up now.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  She says that.  All she needs is an inkling of him going, yeah, honey, you're right.  And boom, the Twinkie box has come out, and she knows she could go up to six.  Yeah.  This guy's cool, because he's not into this whole Hollywood thing.  He doesn't give a shit about them.  That's why he works on the show. 
[02:19:30]  I love his honesty.  This guy's dealt with Marines.  Yeah.  And then what's the black model, the plus-size model?  What?  Takara.  Yeah, she thinks she's beautiful, because she's a big girl.  Full-figured woman.  Yeah, you've seen her lately.  She's even bigger?  No, she's kept the weight off, and she's been on the cover of a lot of magazines.  I mean, every time I still do a show over in London, so I fly through a JFK every now  and then.  Yeah.  And she is on the cover of all these magazines, damn near freaking news.  So she kind of listened to you, because during the show, she's like, you know what?  I don't really care. 
[02:20:00]  Maybe I'll lose five pounds during the show, but I like that I'm a full-figured model.  Oh, I hate that full-figured word.  You're a fatso.  But the reality is, she's a full-figured model at, what was she at the time, 22, 23 on  the show?  Oh, yeah, 23, yeah.  And that's when you've got to start paying attention, because eventually the metabolism  is going to slow down, and you're going to be a big, fat pig.  Yep, damn right.  Unless you change your ways.  But it looks like she followed your advice.  Oh, yeah.  In fact, she's even lost some more weight on it.  And I tell you, she looks freaking good.  See?  And look, she's going to be nudes in another magazine. 
[02:20:30]  I think she was sexy, definitely.  And now she's getting all kinds of work and offers.  It just goes to show people.  They don't understand that if you lose the weight and get a little self-respect, you're  going to get some work.  Harvey, I've got to tell you one thing.  I'm a little disappointed in you guys for two things.  First of all, that you let Jeff Conway get away.  Oh, let me tell you about that.  Yeah.  Just to explain, on the new Celebrity Fit Club, it's the dude in Taxi that never really  did anything after Taxi, even though he'll tell you he was in this and that, blah, 
[02:21:00]  blah, blah.  All the other guys went on to huge fame.  And it turns out he just has deep, deep troubles with drugs and everything else.  He was on the show.  He lasted, what, three weeks?  And they had to throw him in rehab.  He was such a mess.  Oh, yeah.  Now, I chased his ass after he ran off the set to his dressing room.  And they're lucky there was no cameras in there.  Because I tell you, one of the security guys had to break into the room and get between  and I was ready to rip his freaking head off.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So he didn't get away.  He didn't get off easy, believe me.  Yeah, and he actually said, when I was your age or something like that, or when I was 
[02:21:30]  in my prime, I could take you, Harvey.  I was like, yeah, right.  Bring it on.  Bring it on, baby.  But it was kind of a bummer that you guys had to say goodbye to him because he made great  TV.  Yeah.  He did.  He comes back later on, so.  Oh, he does?  Yeah, it's going to be pretty interesting when you see him.  No, it's going to be the feel-good story, right?  The feel-good piece.  No, no, actually, it won't be.  I hope not, because that's what they usually do.  Oh, look, he was a mess at the beginning of the show, but look, look what he's doing  with his life now.  Ugh.  I hate that shit. 
[02:22:00]  I don't need that with my TV watching.  It could have been a feel-good story, but he fucked it up for himself, so.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's good to hear.  Very good to hear.  But these people.  But hold on, just so they get rid of Jeff Conway, and they bring in one of the Gunner  kids?  Yeah.  He needs to lose, like, three pounds.  Like, what were you guys thinking?  Hey, I had nothing to do with the casting, but I...  All of a sudden, they're like, all right, Jeff Conway's gone.  He was a complete mess, a drug addict, all these personal problems.  Like, it sucks they're losing Jeff Conway, but I'm sure they're going to find some other  mess, whether it's a really fat person or something. 
[02:22:30]  What was it, Nelson?  A Gunner Nelson, that's right.  Gunner Nelson.  I'm sorry, one of the Nelson twins.  And he comes walking out, and he's pretty much like, he needs to lose, like, three pounds  and do a couple sit-ups.  That's it.  Yeah.  He got a taste of reality, though.  So he gave me a challenge, and I put him to the test.  What kind of challenge is a Nelson going to give you?  He said he wanted to go through Marine Corps boot camp.  Oh, boy.  So I think it should air this Sunday, either this Sunday or next Sunday.  But I took him down there, and I gave him one-on-one. 
[02:23:00]  And I tell you what, he hit the wall.  It's going to be a good episode.  Does he still have the long, blonde hair?  Oh, no.  I made him cut his hair.  Nice.  Yeah, I think they showed, like, a preview where they shaved his head or something.  Oh, yeah.  It was repeats this last week, right?  Oh, yeah, because of the Super Bowl.  Okay.  Did you make him choke himself?  With your own hand!  Do you love Arlie Ermey?  Say again?  Do you love Arlie Ermey?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, in fact, when I was drill instructor of the quarter down at Parris Island one time, 
[02:23:30]  he came down and gave me the award.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  That's very cool.  I hear he's a lunatic, but he's a fun guy to meet.  We had him on the show once.  Yeah.  Yeah, awesome guy.  Hey, and then the other mistake Celebrity Fit Club did, and this is why I need to work  for VH1, you should have brought Wendy the Snapple Lady back for a third time.  I love Wendy.  She is such a mess.  Yeah.  You guys should at least do an update to show America that she not only didn't keep 
[02:24:00]  the weight off, that she's probably gained another 10 or 15.  And she kills birds.  The fact, I love the fact that she blamed her weight gain on, well, having a sister.  Yeah.  Having another child, and she didn't feel like she was the one.  She goes all the way back to being three years old, and mommy and daddy brought home  another kid, and that made her eat for her entire life.  She ate the kid.  That would have solved both problems.  You ever really want to break character with one of them and just yell, you fat pig, and 
[02:24:30]  smack them?  He pretty much has done it.  I know.  I mean, there's got to be one that gets really to the point where you have a sincere rage and  hatred for them.  He did that with Mia.  He's done it.  You see Gary Busey in tip-top shape in Lethal Weapon, and next thing you know, he's standing  on a scale next to Biz Markie here going, what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they had to tell him to stop losing weight.  He was so mental that he was becoming anorexic.  Yeah, he did.  He took it overboard. 
[02:25:00]  I want to go on that show.  You know, I weigh about, I don't know, 160, 165.  I want to go on that show and get done at like 120.  Just be completely anorexic.  Anorexic.  And you guys compliment me on my weight loss every week.  I like the way your shoulder blades are poking out.  I lost another seven pounds.  I'm trying, sir.  I'm trying.  I want to see your heart beating through a suit jacket.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, old xylophone ribs, get up on the scale.  At the SNL, that's the skit they need to do with Celebrity Fit Club.  They could have a lot of fun, just a bunch of anorexic girls trying to lose weight. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, and then the panelists, like you guys sitting there, just keep berating them on  how fat they are.  I can only see three ribs.  What's wrong with you?  We're sick on this show, Harvey.  I got to tell you.  The great thing, though, man, is if you're working on this show, a bunch of fat chicks,  if you ever need head, please, they're the most eager, aren't they?  Oh, they're lovely.  Just love me.  Yeah, any surprises?  And they're eating.  Any surprises for the rest of the season?  Yeah, we got a couple of them. 
[02:26:00]  The one with Gunner is going to be pretty good, and we bring Jeff back, and he screws it all  up.  He just blew his golden opportunity where he could have got back on the right track.  It's going to be a good episode.  Right.  And the comedy writer guy, the blonde?  Oh, Bruce.  Yeah, Bruce.  Oh, yeah.  Just making joke after joke after joke.  I think I know him, Bruce Falanch.  He wrote for Tough Crowd.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I do know him, right?  No, he wrote for the Oscars all the time.  Hollywood Square.  He's a very good writer guy.  He's got two squares on Hollywood Square.  He's just joking his way through the whole show.  That's his mask. 
[02:26:30]  He actually does well in the end when we go back to the football field, the Capitallon.  So he's going to be good.  And actually, he does something else along the season.  I took him down to the base and have him climb a bunch of cargo nets and stuff.  Oh, I thought you meant when he did something good that he dropped to the floor with a heart  attack or something.  Because you working pretty hard there, Harvey.  Any talk of number four, Celebrity Fit Club?  Oh, yeah.  We're casting right now as we speak. 
[02:27:00]  Any, can you let on to who might be on that show?  I actually believe that I don't know yet because I'm filming at London's show right now.  Wait, there's a London version of this?  Yeah, that's where we started.  We started over in London when I was stationed over there with the Marines.  We rip off a lot of the shows from England, man.  Well, you're an American, so it's our show.  Say again?  You're an American, so it's our show.  Which one?  No, Anthony's saying we steal shows from England, but I'm saying you're an American,  so it's an America show.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Puts the American flag in the show.  How long have you been in the Corps? 
[02:27:30]  22 years.  Wow.  Wow.  And the nerve of me to try to talk to you man-to-man and say Corps.  The Corps.  Give him a note.  Hurrah.  I'm surprised you said that, though.  I know my father's an ex-Marine, but this is the nerve of me to try to act like just two  men talking military.  No such thing as ex-Marines, Jimmy.  Former Marine.  What's a Marine?  Former Marine.  And he's talking to you as he has a breathe-right strip on his nose.  I have a stuffy nose, sir.  Hey, Kelly LeBrock, thumbs up or down? 
[02:28:00]  All up.  All the way up, right?  Oh, yeah.  Even when she was fat at the beginning of the show?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was a stud all the way through.  She was on, what show was she on recently?  Tyra or something.  And they show how much weight she ended up losing.  She's like ripped now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Good.  We did a 5K at the end, me, her, and my son, we ran a 5K, and she did really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's still sexy.  Yeah, she is.  Gorgeous.  All right, Harvey. 
[02:28:30]  Well, Harvey, we're loving the show.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks for watching.  Success.  Anything we're plugging today?  Oh, hell yeah.  How about that website of mine?  HarveyWalden.com.  Naked pictures?  Hey, I can make it happen if you want to.  No, no, it's okay.  I guess it's workout stuff?  Yeah.  We got the DVD out there.  We got all kind of motivational T-shirts and coffee mugs.  You name it, we got it out there.  All right.  Okay, buddy.  Thank you.  It's Harvey Walden. 
[02:29:00]  Hey, thank God for having me.  Semper Fi.  Hoorah.  Harvey Walden, what, the 3rd, 4th, 5th?  What is it?  On the 4th.  Wow.  There you go.  All right, Harvey, thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  Hey, thanks for having me.  It's Celebrity Fit Club.  It's on VH1 every weekend.  It's on every day, actually.  He's still in the Marine Corps, right?  I don't know.  Seems like a cool guy, huh?  Yeah.  What a fucking tough guy.  Yeah.  He disliked Ann, too, so he was okay in my book.  The second week where he went, ugh.  Just that he didn't try to pull punches.  He'd go, well, you know, I shouldn't say that.  He's like, yeah, he didn't give a shit. 
[02:29:30]  He's an ass.  He's just great.  Fucking martial artist, military D.I.  He's just got no time for dreck.  We all know that Marines don't like those people.  Of course, they're not a bunch of Hollywood fat fags.  He loves attacking these people, I'm sure.  No hesitation with those guys.  Like, you ask them the question, bam, it gets answered.  You like this guy?  No.  This guy, fat.  This chick, bitch, fat ass.  That's how it is.  If you hesitate, it could translate into you getting shot.  I'll tell you, that Kirstie Alley really holds my interest. 
[02:30:00]  He started off the interview going friggin', friggin'.  Like, three minutes with you guys.  Next, he's like, fuck that.  Shit, fuck, yeah.  Talking like a Marine.  But Vos, you did raise a good point, though, about how that's someone's mask.  That was, like, insightful.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  You like that?  Yeah, no, we really did.  It was good.  It was deep.  I just wish they would bring Wendy the Snapple Lady back every time.  She continues to not lose weight.  They had her on two shows.  Well, she cried about a bird, too.  Not only a baby, but a bird.  And then just have her keep getting on that scale until one day she just has a complete 
[02:30:30]  nervous breakdown in front of everybody.  And just says, look, I can't lose weight.  I'm a fatty.  How much weight do they lose?  I'm fat, and I'll always be fat.  What?  I'm tempted to go on that.  I mean, I'm not a celebrity, but I'd still like to do it.  There you are.  I have to lose, like, 15 pounds.  They had Ralphie Mae on.  Just find a show called Fat Club without the celebrity.  They try to have all different sizes, saying we all could, like, do something with our bodies.  Yeah, you could easily get on there.  Well, I don't know about easily. 
[02:31:00]  They might look at me and I don't qualify.  Some of them lose up to 40 pounds.  What's his name?  Bam's father holds the record.  Patrice turned it down.  Oh, yeah?  Phil?  Patrice turned it down?  Yeah, they offered it to Patrice.  He turned it down.  To host it, Patrice turned it down.  Not to host it?  Oh, he would have been a great host.  No, they put, no, not to.  Instead of that fake shit from Anthony.  No, they fucking know.  Or Ant.  Ant.  I mean, he's a pal.  Wouldn't you call him by Anthony now?  Huh?  You an Ant?  No.  No, he was.  They wanted him on the show.  I'm like, I can't stomach the guy. 
[02:31:30]  Even to just even rip into him.  I just hate watching him on TV.  He's loud, right?  Yeah, he's just, I don't know what it is.  And it's all just that fag thing.  I mean.  Ow!  Please.  Mario Cantone should have a bitch fight over material.  Over their act.  Mario.  Super fag.  At least Mario writes his own stuff.  Shut up.  Yeah.  What do you mean shut up, Ant's a fucking thief?  He was called, Rogan called him out right on TV.  I fucking love Rogan.  Rogan doesn't call out anybody.  Rogan calls anybody out.  You're a fucking thief and a hack. 
[02:32:00]  Then Buddy Hacker jumps in and shut up.  He's a thief and a hack and Rogan called him out.  And then fucking last comic put him on the next year.  What are you going to do?  Confront Rogan?  Punch that Cro-Magnon head?  Really?  I was behind Rogan.  Were you kidding me?  Of course you were behind him.  You should be kneeling in front of him, you fucking sissy.  Wow, real brave behind Joe Rogan.  Gotta get four punches and three kicks into your head.  He looks like the fucking BC cartoon.  He would just grab your head and fuck your mouth without missing a beat.  Just in case the hundred guys he's taking on, one gets through. 
[02:32:30]  You're there to help him out.  I backed him up.  Wow, you're real brave.  Really?  You backed him up?  You backed up a fucking multi-degree black belt in Trashing Ant.  What a man's man you are.  You and Harvey should talk about fighting.  You're a pink ninja.  You'll fight for the pink team.  He's on fire today.  Shut up, ninja.  I don't need you to comment.  He doesn't need you to comment.  The boss doesn't need you to comment.  No, I don't.  Oh, you'll take a compliment from anybody. 
[02:33:00]  I'm spinning when you talk.  Eli from Brooklyn.  Hey, guys.  Do you notice how this Dateline host sounds like Casey Kasem doing song requests?  He's the worst, dude.  Yeah, it's that put on.  Our next predator from Bakersfield is requesting anal sex from a 16-year-old.  Yeah, taking requests and everything.  Long-distance dedication.  He writes, Dear Casey, I love 13-year-old ass.  It's a song called Who Spilled Cranberry Juice in the Back of My Undershorts?  Well, here it is for you, Bob. 
[02:33:30]  Bloody butt.  All right, Eli.  Thanks, guys.  Good job.  Let's go back to the Dateline Internet Predators episode three audio.  We're in the middle of listening to South Bay Guy.  When we left him, where were we at?  I assume he wants to fuck a kid.  Well, there you go.  And he's seen, he was busted by perverted justice before.  And he admits in this clip that he even has seen the Dateline special before. 
[02:34:00]  So as soon as that guy walked out, he's like, uh-oh.  I think he also just said that he, uh, the cops were outside right when he was pulling up.  Did that just happen?  Yeah.  He's the guy that saw cops busting the guy before him and still went in the house because  the decoy said, oh, no, that's my neighbor.  Because he was so worked up.  He didn't want to believe that this was a setup.  He was so worked up in his head in a lather.  A lather?  I need that cock! 
[02:34:30]  What would have happened if I wasn't here, Keith?  You show up with booze.  Well, I'd be fucking the girl that I was chatting with.  You fucking cockblock?  Yeah.  If I hadn't cockblocked you.  Guy really is awful.  What would have happened if I wasn't here, Keith?  You show up with booze.  What else you got?  That's all this.  This booze.  You got booze.  You know, I don't know.  You're going to booze up a 13-year-old girl.  You can hammer me where you want.  I'm telling you, I am wrong.  You got to listen to me.  I'm wrong.  This guy's great. 
[02:35:00]  Bottom line, I'm wrong.  It's not your first time down this road.  Lawyers are cringing right now.  Do you ever watch Dateline NBC?  I've seen that episode, actually, and that's why I just, I don't prefer to be on camera.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Well, we'll adhere to your wishes.  Sure, why not?  By shoving three of them in your face right now.  You saw the earlier episode.  Yes, I did.  So, let me get this straight.  You saw our earlier story.  Right.  You drove by this house and saw police out front.  Yeah.  Yet, you walked in here anyway.  I'm bored. 
[02:35:30]  Like I told you.  Bored.  Bored.  Bored.  I'm bored of not having sex with children.  I'm bored.  God, it's Jordan Jim.  I don't know.  I need a hobby.  Come here, kid.  Maybe he meant, I want a girl with a shape like a board.  I got to hear that again.  He's bored.  I'm bored.  Bored.  Yes.  Bored.  Whatever you'd like to say, we'd love to hear it.  But obviously, we can't keep it here and you're free to go whenever you want. 
[02:36:00]  Absolutely.  What I'm going to tell you is that I'm never going to do this again on everything I love  in life.  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get rid of my computer.  But you came here.  I understand that, but it's wrong.  You walked into the ward.  You talked to the girl.  I didn't.  Okay.  How's he going to get rid of his computer, by the way, one of these guys?  Yeah, believe me.  The police will take care of the computer.  He's going to make a deal with NASA and get it on the next space shuttle mission.  Going to get rid of it.  Do you have a vat of computer-dissolving acid? 
[02:36:30]  Right.  I'm never going to do this again.  You're in prison.  He's going to throw it into a volcano.  They're all getting fucking reamed in prison now.  It'll be funny if, as he's leaving, he goes, by the way, is she here?  Yeah.  Can I at least get a look at her?  Can I just say hi?  Let's go to Dan in Sacramento.  Dan.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Dan.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  I wanted to ask Opie if when he went to go meet his girlfriend for the first time,  was he afraid he'd bump into a deadline reporter? 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Easy.  The first time he went over the house.  Easy.  Hi, Opie.  This is a popular radio show host.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Wopie, what were you thinking when you came here?  Easy.  I just.  I just.  All right.  Here we go.  Girl.  I didn't.  Okay.  I don't know what I can.  What would happen.  But you got to want something to risk. 
[02:37:30]  Holy shit.  Great observation.  I had to stop the tape.  Listen to this.  Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne, what's up?  I just wanted to say the guy talking right now sounds just like me.  He's like Bob Kelly.  Oh, listen to this.  He's so right.  Hold on.  I'm going to go backwards a little bit here.  Give it a little time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's see if Corinne's right.  I just wanted to hold my hand.  Hold my rattle.  He says that I'm never going to do this again on everything I love in life.  I'm going to go home.  I'm going to get rid of my computer.  But you came here.  I understand that.  You walked into the war. 
[02:38:00]  You talked to the girl.  I didn't.  Okay.  I don't know what I can.  What would happen.  But you got to want something to risk.  She's coming in here after seeing police.  Oh, I just thought she might have been sure about something next to her.  I was like, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe it's honestly, I don't know.  Now when I walk out here, am I going to be arrested?  That's not up to me.  It's up to the 15 cops outside.  Right.  Waiting to arrest you.  It depends how fast you can run, son.  Which way are you going to go? 
[02:38:30]  Right.  I would talk for as long as possible in that kitchen.  Yeah.  Can I get a Diet Coke, baby?  Well.  Wait until the Statute of Limitations runs out.  Yeah.  Seven years we've been talking.  We got Pete Townsend on the line from Great Britain.  Pete.  Hi, mate.  If he's going to throw that computer away, I'll take it.  You know what I'm saying about the rough boys there, mate.  Pete Townsend.  My friend Gary Glitter's over here as well.  He's got a little tune.  He wants to play on the little meat flute.  Meat flute.  All right, Pete. 
[02:39:00]  Da-na-na-na-na-na.  Eight.  Da-na-na-na.  All right.  Who are you?  Wait.  There's a pile-up cop arrested?  What's this clip about?  I don't know.  It continues the story.  South Bay guy.  Inside, Jazzman04 decides to cut our conversation short.  I'm sorry.  I need to.  No, no, no.  Well, I'm sorry.  And makes a run for it.  The detectives spring into action,  arresting the man sitting in his car across the street, 
[02:39:30]  then Jazzman04,  and then the man parked on the side street.  This all happens less than six minutes from the time the first car pulls up.  This was interesting.  As for that man who sat in his car while another man walked in the house,  guess what he does for a living?  Do you want a criminal investigator?  A federal agent working for the Department of Homeland Security.  Active duty Homeland Security.  There could be a terrorist in that pink little butt. 
[02:40:00]  He just had to work that out.  He's looking for Al Kitta.  He wants to make sure he gets blown.  No, no.  Well, you know.  That was an interesting segment because three guys pull up at the same time.  Three guys.  She was a whore.  One goes into the house. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  This little slut.  A little whore.  And two guys are kind of sitting in their cars,  just kind of watching the whole thing unfold,  but not leaving.  Still, again, thinking,  this might work out for me.  This could be just something else.  Maybe they're filming a movie.  And they just sat there in the car watching,  and the cops sprung into action,  arrested them.  Well, there's an extra here I recognize.  They might be filming a movie.  Yeah, right?  Wasn't he wearing it with Godzilla?  Well, so now we have the...  Godzilla.  The Homeland Security guy is in the house. 
[02:41:00]  This is more on him now, I think.  We're moving on.  He actually, he just gets arrested.  I think he just runs.  Never makes it.  Yeah, but he cops a big plea.  This is him talking to the cops.  Yeah.  And remember the federal agent?  He can't seem to stop talking to the cops.  My father was a police officer.  I was a police officer.  I worked for Department of Homeland Security.  Okay.  I understand you guys have a job to do,  and I'm not trying to tell you anything else other than that.  I swear to God, as God is my witness,  I'm wearing St. Michael's medal right now. 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  I was not going to do anything with her.  But the detective doesn't seem to be buying his story.  But I'm telling you,  I don't believe it that you didn't intend to have sex  at some point with this, sir.  I swear to God, sir, I was not.  It would have happened.  Sir, I swear to God it was not.  You know what?  I guarantee you, it would have happened.  And he's got one more thing to say  to the disgraced federal agent.  And in your position, you should know better.  Sir, I know that.  You know the law.  That's even worse.  You know what?  That puts a bad mark on my job, 
[02:42:00]  on everybody.  Every cop in this country,  you put a bad mark on them.  Ah.  I know, sir.  Do you think a PBA card could get you out of this mess?  That might have worked  if you just would have pulled the PBA out  a little inconspicuously and said,  Hey, uh...  That's an association.  My father was a kid-toucher.  I'm a kid-toucher.  My father was once a kid.  I was once a kid.  You know what?  That's how you know you're in trouble  when one cop is calling another cop, sir.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  When a guy from Homeland Security  is calling a local detective, sir.  Turn it right around on him.  Good point, sir.  Yeah?  Where were you, September 11th, sir?  Hey, whoa, hey.  Hi, hey, I'm Homeland Security.  Where were you?  That's right.  What's your last name?  Let's go to Doug.  Sounds Saudi Arabian.  I'm checking her geranimals.  Doug in Minnesota.  Doug?  I want to pop your can.  That song is still coming in.  All right.  Now we got two guys coming in at once.  What was this one about?  Anyone? 
[02:43:00]  I didn't see the show, unfortunately.  This was just two sort of younger gentlemen,  but obviously too old.  Wait, Voss.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, go ahead.  What?  No, I was giving you an idea.  What's that?  Nothing.  I was just saying, you know.  Voss, just say it.  When they're interviewing these guys,  one of them break out to the guy,  like the guy in The Godfather,  she had the best pussy in town.  You know what I'm talking about  when he was talking about Meryl Monroe?  Yeah, I got the clip right here.  Hey, it's Voss. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, it's Voss.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Hey, it's Voss.  Boring.  Today, Junior.  I actually like the delivery.  I love the rhythm.  Oh, you lean over and whisper it,  and I'm like,  don't fucking put that one on me.  It's because it's funny  that you didn't know the guy's name,  the guy from The Godfather.  It's Jack Waltz.  I'm the Godfather.  He had the best pussy in town. 
[02:44:00]  Get the quote wrong.  No one said that, Rich.  What was the quote again?  I don't know.  You like, she was the best piece of ass in town.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had,  and I've had him all over the world.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had,  and I've had him all over the world.  It was just like how you said it.  Now you get the hell out of this kitchen.  This fits you.  Yeah.  And a man in my position  can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Slobber.  All right, here we go. 
[02:44:30]  Look ridiculous.  Two guys come in at once.  He was banging elementary school students  two at a time.  Well, you know,  interesting side note, guys.  But in the book,  and in the original film it was shot,  Jack Waltz was giving a girl  who was 13 a pony,  or she was 12.  Yes.  And then when Tom Hagen's leaving,  he looks up,  and he sees the mother  pushing the girl back in the bedroom.  The girl's crying,  so you have to realize that  he got her a pony  and then fucked her when she was 12.  For some reason,  they took that out.  The hot factor.  And we're here  at his production studios. 
[02:45:00]  Jack Waltz.  What's that?  You phony talking son of a bitch!  Let's get a mic in Jersey.  Mike, hey.  Mike, thanks for calling the program.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I got a song.  Goo, goo, goo, goo.  Ga, ga, ga, ga.  That's all she ever says to me.  The police.  That's really good.  I'm sorry.  You're out, Mike.  I like it.  Maybe I could help.  All right, we're almost done here  because we've got to move on  to Steve Martin.  We're not done with this.  We'll have to pick this up tomorrow.  You're saying that we're going to give  a little bit more in the installation. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  That's radio talk.  Going to go to something more offensive  than kid touching Steve Martin  in that Pink Panther movie.  That's right, from the pink pussy  to the pink panther.  Jesus.  Two guys come in at once.  Listen to this.  This is 20-year-old Sebastian Rodriguez  here after chatting online about sex  with a decoy posing as a 12-year-old girl.  He's brought along a friend.  What are you guys up to?  Nothing.  Nothing.  We just came to hang out.  Sebastian also brought condoms  and Mike's hard lemonade. 
[02:46:00]  Just what the decoy asked for.  What did your buddy Sebastian here  tell you about what was going to go on here tonight?  Really nothing.  I just came along.  It was just a tag along.  Just a tag along.  I really wasn't planning on doing anything, sir.  I was just going to come over here.  You got Mike's hard lemonade.  And Mike's hard cock.  Sounds like you were planning to have sex with this girl.  I'm not, sir.  But why would you bring this stuff?  I don't know, sir.  How does that look?  I don't know, sir.  I'm so sorry. 
[02:46:30]  I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go to jail.  When Sebastian and his friend leave,  it appears they think they're off the hook.  Great.  Thanks a lot, sir.  But not for long.  Oops.  Don't go outside.  Bruce in Jersey.  Hey, I got a song for you.  All right.  Hey, little girl, is your dad home?  Did he go and leave you all alone?  Oh, no. 
[02:47:00]  I got a strange desire.  Oh, fuck.  It's that reporter again.  All right.  You know, let's play two more clips,  because Six Pack So Cali, this is a good one, too.  Yeah.  Southern Cali.  Asking, offers him a paper towel.  Remember this one?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Here comes the man who calls himself Six Pack So Cali.  He's 26-year-old Christopher Urban. 
[02:47:30]  What?  I'm going to wash my hands, folks.  Okay.  Get the dogs right over there.  Oh, thank you.  He's here after making plans for sex with a 13-year-old girl named Kelly.  That's way watered down.  Way watered down.  And he's brought along Bacardi Ron.  You came to see Kelly?  Yeah.  And how old is Kelly?  Kelly's way too young for me.  Way too young for you?  Yeah.  Then why did you come here, Chris?  I came here to tell her that, actually.  To tell her that she was way too young?  Actually, I did that. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a child molester, and he's cheap.  He's watering down the liquor.  She's like, you know what?  I can fuck anybody on the block who's going to bring me good liquor.  The best part of that clip, though, he's washing his hands,  and then the Dateline guy hands him a paper towel.  He goes, thank you.  And he goes, oh, thank you.  This is how they should play it.  You've got to learn how to lie.  Be the reporter.  Ask me how old I think she is.  How old did you think she was?  A hundred.  Days. 
[02:48:30]  Days old.  All right, here's the last clip for today.  That's what he says now.  But when he was online, six-pack SoCali not only had a sexually disgusting chat,  he also turned on his webcam and sent photos of himself naked.  Close-ups we can't show you.  Why?  Did you transmit this photogram?  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, goodness gracious.  He's very proud of his photo, it looks like.  Is that wart on your cock ears?  Hey, that Viagra works great.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Ah, for the love of Eve.  Oh, my.  Transmit this photogram.  Oh, my.  I, I sent, I didn't know I sent that one.  Oh.  You didn't know.  That one.  Well, actually, yeah, I did, but.  All right.  Wow.  To a 13-year-old girl.  I'm sorry.  You're right. 
[02:49:30]  You're right.  I know.  I wasn't thinking.  And that's what, you know, even coming down here.  I mean, look at me.  I didn't even take a shower.  If I was going to do something like that, I would have, I would have taken a shower.  You know?  I mean, that's, that's the first thing you do.  I mean, look at me.  I, I'm so dirty, like.  I know.  Well, I'll tell you what's dirty is this conversation you had.  Yeah, I know.  It was the first time we'd heard the I didn't take a shower defense.  Yeah, you won't be taking it when you're going either.  You can try telling that to the cops.  Yeah.  Take a shower like American History X.  I don't take a shower.  Look, smile on my balls.  They're oniony.  I never would have let a child lick these. 
[02:50:00]  That's a very convincing argument, sir.  Yeah.  Like, he's, he's a bastard enough to go in there to try to have sex with a kid.  But, uh, he's good enough to have showered before.  Sir, I watered down the liquor and my balls are dirty.  What am I, a cad?  I just came to tell this child, you're too young for me to fuck.  A charlatan?  Yes.  What do you think I am?  A Svengali?  Does this fucking broad ever stop dancing?  Oh, Ellen, I just, I.  I just want her to break her leg. 
[02:50:30]  I fucking, I hope she.  No, I'm going to go.  What?  What do you hope?  No, I didn't.  What?  What do you hope?  No.  Uh-oh.  But when I saw a cop out on 34th and Vine, I got into some trouble cause I love pussy under  nine.  That was, uh, Greg from Chicago.  I just ripped him off.  But you knew you could do a better job.  Thank God you went with that.  Yeah.  Cause it was too good.  He would have been all over the place for that.  Thank you.  Greg from Chicago gets full credit. 
[02:51:00]  Uh, Greg.  Yo.  We had no confidence in you, so Anthony decided to do your line.  I stole your line.  But, but for the hell of it, let's see if you could have done it better than Anthony.  You get full credit.  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I, you know, that was, um, I was just going to go a little, love pussy number nine.  See, love pussy number nine.  That was under nine.  Under nine.  We got it.  It made your line much better, but thank you, Greg.  You mumbled through it foolishly.  All right.  We're going to go to break with some more, uh, drunk audio.  I still love this.  Let's go have our pecan. 
[02:51:30]  They're complaining.  Oh, I don't have nothing in me.  Oh, I do.  Done.  You're going to beat a minute 56?  Well, I don't know.  I gave you a 45 before.  I mean, I know I can't add them up, but.  All right.  The current record is a minute 56.  We go to break with some drunk audio.  Wait, wait, wait.  Quickly.  What happened?  I'm excited here.  What?  I don't know if I should be.  What?  What?  I'm seeing.  Pizza?  Pizza storage boxes being, being constructed out here.  A lot of them.  Uh-oh.  Now, these boxes are usually used to transport office supplies and, uh, uh, cubicle things 
[02:52:00]  from one place to another.  Get that kid in here.  Do I have reason to be excited?  Get that kid in here.  Mars?  E-Rock?  Mars?  Get this kid.  Get this kid in here.  Does anyone know why this is happening out here?  And should I be?  This could be a great day.  What's going on?  What time is it?  Intern that doesn't know anything?  Because no one else is brave enough to come in here and say what's going on?  That's all I wanted.  No, go ahead. 
[02:52:30]  Not that, Mike.  No.  Dude, this one.  That one.  Share it with him.  That one's been broken all morning.  Voss is on that one, though.  Find an open mic, please.  Give him the cordless.  Give him the cordless.  Just walking back and forth.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on out there?  We are making boxes so the fine people that work here along with us can pack up their stuff.  Did you just say work with us?  Well, in the same...  Did you just say work with us?  What are you saying?  Us as one of the team of people that have been toiling here for a year and a half?  I want to ask Ichabod Cranebody what he's talking about. 
[02:53:00]  What do you think?  Thank you.  This kid's got a smile.  I like him.  I've been doing some form of the Opie and Anthony, well, or the Opie show, whatever,  for well over 20 years.  And how long have you been here?  Four weeks.  And you're us.  Okay.  Yeah.  And it's all just we.  I see what you're saying.  You're segregating us from the group.  That's fine.  Of course we do.  You get coffee.  That's right.  You don't associate.  Look, you even have your hands in your pocket like the boss does.  I don't like it.  I'm just fucking with you.  Battle-hearted veterans do not let the newbies come in with their backpacks and their gear 
[02:53:30]  and treat them the same way on the battlefield.  Newfangled ideas.  I don't like them.  Plus the fact you're wearing a Red Sox cap.  Yeah.  Every fucking day we got to look at that thing.  You guys used to like the Red Sox.  No, we did.  We were confident.  I never even faked it.  Actually, I never faked it.  I faked the...  You said you were a Mets fan.  Yeah.  I said I was a Mets fan when I was in Boston.  I did make believe I liked the Pats for a little while. 
[02:54:00]  Yes.  That's a fact.  But it's finally happening.  Now, what info do you have besides just folding the boxes?  Do you have any info?  Does Ben have any info on this move?  Ben, what's going on?  Ben Sparks.  Ben, come on.  Let's get moving, Ben.  The move is beginning.  The move is...  Opie, what a great day this is.  Get the fuck out!  Master Poe is helping get the boxes constructed.  Supervising.  How long will this take? 
[02:54:30]  Knowing XM, eight months.  Yeah.  This guy is good, though.  He's a very dedicated young charge.  We're getting a lot of static.  I think I just blew this mic out.  I'm sure you did.  That could have been.  Tim is a psycho, but he's a very dedicated boy.  Did you turn that off?  I think I just blew this mic.  Opie was talking about blowing Mike.  No, I didn't.  Mike is a 12-year-old boy.  I added out three seconds later to try to help myself.  Outside of the house.  Why is Don here?  You're like supervising? 
[02:55:00]  What's your deal?  Where you just came up?  Don Wicklund, everyone.  I think they're discussing my raise.  Ugh.  Don?  Hey.  Don.  We brought in Don Wicklund to explain the move as Iraq pulls the mic boom out of the  console like a complete idiot.  I know.  Amazing.  What?  Move the intern.  Yeah.  Is it the mic that was?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  I thought I blew this mic out.  Way to go, Eric.  Do you want to wreck anything else while the boss is looking at you? 
[02:55:30]  I love Derek comes in.  Move the intern like he's a piece of furniture.  Yeah.  Just move the piece of shit off that mic so a real human can use it.  Move coffee getter.  Yeah.  Just tell Cumstain to slide over it.  What's the matter with you, Derek?  He has a name, don't you?  What do we know, Don?  What do we know?  So Monday, they're packing up today.  They're moving all the stuff Monday.  Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  When?  That fast?  Yep.  Let me riddle me this.  What day will it be that we come in here?  Now, I'm not even talking about the cubicles being gone. 
[02:56:00]  When will we come in here and only us and Ron and Fezz's people will have any business  being here?  I don't think it's going to be any more than a week or two.  Because they have to move all the cubicles out.  Holy moly.  But will the people go first and then the cubicles?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Yep.  That'd be silly.  So when will we come in and all we have to worry about seeing is Ron and Fezz's people?  I would say maybe, like I said, maybe a week or two.  A week or two.  And someone's going to tell us this.  When?  Today.  I like just seeing it happen. 
[02:56:30]  I like seeing Don's baby blues in the other room and I like seeing it just had it.  I saw a bunch of boxes being put together and I'm like, uh-oh.  We got plans for that space.  Either we are fired or the space is going to open up.  It would be funny if they were with the boxes and they just walked into our office and start  packing up all this shit.  But according to Howard, we got-  We've been off the air for hours and didn't know it.  But according to Howard, we got nothing going on.  Yeah.  Okay.  As they take this whole show to the next level now.  I think your studio is good.  Giving us this entire space. 
[02:57:00]  Well, ours will be better.  It'll be bigger.  Bigger and better.  And prettier.  And we do a show with no hole.  Right.  Thank you, Don Wicklund.  Yep.  Thanks for the info.  Bravo.  I didn't know the boxes were coming today.  I'm psyched.  So that was the biggest surprise.  All right.  We're going to go to break with Drunk Audio.  Get away from the mic.  Well, hold on.  This guy does a lot of-  Oh, you want to close out before we go to break?  I'm doing what I was told.  By who?  Ben Spark?  He's a family man.  Oh, my God.  Tell them exactly what Ben told me about you. 
[02:57:30]  Like, you got a family and a lot of stuff.  I have a wife and a son.  Wow.  And he has quite the commute to come here.  What town?  Springfield.  Springfield, Mass.  Who cares, you idiot?  You commute from Springfield, Massachusetts.  Yes, I do.  Every day?  Almost every day.  Nobody cares.  Wait, stop it.  You're really not telling me.  Wait, you're a family man that comes from Springfield, Mass every day to get his coffee.  Cackling at me.  Kill myself.  It's true.  Dude, how long is your commute? 
[02:58:00]  Springfield here is three hours.  Kill yourself.  And what does your wife think?  She married an asshole.  Six hours of your day, at least, is spent driving.  I'm working in Bridgeport.  When I'm not working, I go home.  Wait, you're working in Bridgeport.  Right.  Doing what?  What field?  You don't have to be specific.  I was a manager in a grocery store.  The story gets better and better.  Assistant to the assistant manager of a grocery store. 
[02:58:30]  How old are your kids?  My son, Hunter, is four.  Don't you think he needs a daddy?  What's that?  Yeah.  Hey.  Do you get to, like, tuck him into bed?  I used to, yeah.  I used to.  So we're more important than your family?  Which it should be, by the way.  Absolutely.  I'm saying that's a bad thing.  So wait, do you have a dream you want to be in radio?  Um, if it's not with XM, no, I don't, it has to be with these guys.  Wow.  Holy shit.  This guy's dedicated. 
[02:59:00]  We hired another stalker.  You know something?  Why?  What's the last thing?  I like this guy, though.  I like him too.  I like this guy.  I just mean physically.  I don't know his name.  Tim.  What is it?  Ah, Tim.  Tim.  Yeah, Tim from Boston.  How can I remember that?  Yeah.  I was here last, you know, I was the first winner of that contest that we don't do anymore.  We don't.  The guy with the cape.  He was the guy in Springfield.  Tim from Springfield.  He was Salt on the Media.  Salt on the Media.  Right.  Oh, I thought I recognized you.  Yeah, I didn't at all. 
[02:59:30]  Assault on the Media.  Yeah.  You did that.  Okay, I remember you.  So now you're an intern with the program.  Weren't you wearing a cape or something?  Yes, I was wearing a head yellow cape.  I remember you.  He was the guy with a cape.  I know it's so sad.  He's probably walking around like, I did a lot for the show.  I left an impression.  We have no idea who he is.  I just figured out now, but I'll give you this much.  Every day when I'm wandering around and you're asking me if I need anything, I'm like, this  guy looks familiar.  Something about him.  Something about him.  Okay.  Yeah, but you also, didn't you used to go to all their signings up at Newberry Comics  up in the Boston area? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  What were you, 10?  I was, yeah, 15.  We never touched you, right?  No.  I chipped it.  Still sticking to that story.  Were you ever invited onto the rock bus?  No.  They wouldn't let me on.  All right.  Tim from Boston.  Tim's a good man.  Wrecking his life to intern for us.  I remember a couple of girls.  What do you reckon his life?  He's getting away from the wife and kids.  He's fucking, what would you rather do?  Stay home with family or come look at his tits?  He's got a four-year-old and how old's the other one?  How many kids you got?  Oh, you got one.  Exactly.  This is fun.  I remember a couple of girls in Boston that might have been his age on the rock bus 
[03:00:30]  insisting that their tits get signed.  All right, Tim.  Thank you.  There he goes.  A six-hour commute every day.  Six hours?  Where do you sleep?  In his car.  Second Avenue, right?  No, I sleep back.  Wait, that's, he's the guy that parks on Second Avenue, too?  Yeah, and then he sleeps for a while in the car.  Yeah, you do.  Come on.  Where's Travis?  Get Travis in here.  He parks on Second Avenue for the rest of the country. 
[03:01:00]  That's really far from the studio because it's cheaper to park there.  It's the other side of Manhattan.  Right.  When you get out of work, you don't have to go through traffic.  Travis, you got to confirm what he just said.  Yeah.  And you get out of the city.  He didn't tell me that.  He told Eric.  What?  All right.  He's crazier than Wickey with that commute.  I love the breaking news.  The rest of the XM people are leaving this facility.  Wicklin actually commutes from the south.  Yeah.  He has to cross the Mason-Dixon line in his commute up here.  Well, he commutes like two hours each way, too, right?  Yep. 
[03:01:30]  By the way, you do know as they're leaving, we're going to stand there like fucking Brubaker  and just clap.  As they all leave.  This is from Billy Jack.  I said Brubaker.  Why did you have to ask Billy Jack?  You know, Rich, why don't you just kiss that?  Get my wig.  Why don't you kiss those buns?  I have buns of steel.  You could be one of those decoys.  That could be a 10-year-old boy's ass.  They should just take that picture and send it online. 
[03:02:00]  This ass would lure in men that aren't even pedophiles.  They would just have to have it.  From experience.  Just collect it.  I'm collecting pictures of hairless asses.  Completely hairless.  I can actually, if I bent over right now and ripped my crack wide open, you'd find a couple  of wispy hairs in there.  But they're not even offensive.  And they're not even yours.  They look like eyelashes.  Blink.  Blink.  You'd be at an audition.  All right.  Here we go.  You're what they call doe-assed.  Just big and big eyelashes. 
[03:02:30]  Oh.  Who's taking...  I think it might be because there's white stuff all over it.  Who's taking the pee challenge?  I'm watching.  No, I can't.  I'm done.  The 56 is the record.  We'll do that during the break.  You have to take into account, even though I'm not going to add it to it, but I peed for  45 seconds before, too.  I piss a lot, kid.  So do I.  All right.  You're never going to beat me.  Ooh.  Can I watch and keep time?  Yes.  Give Rich Foster a stopwatch.  Why don't you go in there now?  Let's go.  What?  I got to prepare for this?  Come on.  We'll do it live on the show.  Why don't we do it on the show?  Give him a fucking mic or something. 
[03:03:00]  Why don't you bring a microphone in and fucking help the show out and be a friend to me?  How do you fucking work this?  Hit smart.  By the way, we're doing this instead of talking about Howard Moore, so...  Come on.  It's a treat for everybody.  Wait.  Is that mic on?  No.  I don't think so.  Wait.  I don't know if the wireless will work in the bathroom.  Have we tried the wireless?  It doesn't, right?  Get a phone.  Get a phone.  Get a phone.  All right.  Anthony, as we set them up, more drunk audio.  It's classic moments from the Opie and Anthony show, and the listeners are finding some of 
[03:03:30]  these classic moments slowing down the audio to make us sound drunk.  And it works.  I still like this bit.  We sound hammered.  Uh, this is, uh, myself and Norton, uh, uh, fighting.  They're using the fight, uh, audio a lot.  That's a good one.  This is Anti-Man.  Listen to this one.  We had to do at the show, you know.  Make sure this show ends on time and in a nice fashion.  That's a lot of shit going on.  I don't know, dickhead, because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface. 
[03:04:00]  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  You can't say you want me to voice my opinion and get so pissed off when I voice my opinion.  You're insane.  I'm not insane.  You are insane.  You're insane at times.  It's not the way it happened.  Whatever, Jimmy.  Okay.  Whatever.  Whatever.  It's not the way it happened.  Whatever.  Whatever.  You gotta calm down. 
[03:04:30]  I'm very calm.  You gotta calm down.  You really do.  Hey, look, you're the boss, brother.  Everybody knows you're the boss.  I'm not challenging that.  No, that's not what I'm getting at here.  Of course that's what you're getting at.  No, of course it's not what I'm getting at, Jimmy.  Of course it's not.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Drunken babble.  The Cheers music makes it, too.  Are we ready for the, uh, the attempt at the world record?  You think you're, uh, you've got another two-minute piss in you? 
[03:05:00]  Anthony.  I don't know.  I set the bar.  I've gone.  Yeah, but you just went.  I used to time it, uh, all the time.  I got up to, uh, well over two minutes.  That was, that was just child's play.  All right.  If he sets the record, then, uh.  The dateline piece was child's play.  I will, uh, I will bet anyone, whatever amount of money.  All right.  I think I can get close to three minutes.  I got to take a leak, but it's going to be no more than 20 seconds.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  E-Rock.  E-Rock. 
[03:05:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Hold on.  I got the phone.  Wait.  Tell me when you're going to start.  Voss.  Voss, can you hear us?  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Let me see it.  Let me see it.  Voss, can you hear us?  See, this is why the, oh, we got dummies.  Why is Voss, why is Voss the one doing this?  Why am I kidding?  This is why we needed a cell phone so he could hear us.  Right.  He can't hear us because there's no headphones that go all the way to the bathroom.  This stinks. 
[03:06:00]  Jim just peed all over everybody.  That's what he does.  E-Rock, can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear you.  He just peed all over Voss and me.  He missed me.  Oh, he missed you.  Good.  That's great to know.  What are we looking at here so far?  We're looking at 24 and bumps on his cock.  24 seconds.  29, 30.  Is that Jimmy peeing?  Yeah, Jimmy's peeing right now.  Is he in a stall?  Yeah.  No, he's in the urinal. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, and he just started pissing all over the floor?  Turned around in a complete circle while peeing.  He did a pirouette.  We're at 50 seconds.  Does he still have a good stream?  Seconds are $20.  Stream's still going good.  Oh, shit.  That might be in trouble.  That might be a long sprinkler.  Oh.  What the hell was that?  We're at a minute.  That was a kidney stone.  One minute.  Holy shit.  How is he pissing so much? 
[03:07:00]  110.  Is he purposely slowing it down?  No, he's got a steady stream going.  Oh, shit.  What are we up to?  120.  Oh, I'm done.  Go going.  Wow.  Starting to smell in here.  130.  135.  I'm done.  Yeah.  Wait till tomorrow. 
[03:07:30]  If he breaks your record.  Sounds like he might be slowing down.  Oh, boy.  We're coming up to your record.  145.  150.  Uh-oh.  He's coming up to your record.  He's slowing down a little bit.  Oh, he's got it.  I'm telling you that I could go close to three, so this is okay.  I'm all right with this.  I just lost the record.  Oh.  Yeah.  He beat you by a second.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  Jimmy Norton is the new piss champion. 
[03:08:00]  There we go.  1.57 on the clock.  All right.  I'll have to try harder tomorrow.  Jimmy?  Comment?  Yeah.  Hold on.  I'll be right in.  All right.  Jimmy's coming back in.  Thank you, E-Rock.  No problem.  Let's go to Becky in Mississippi.  Jim Norton's got the new piss record at a minute 57, it looks like. 
[03:08:30]  Becky in Mississippi, what's up?  Hey, when y'all do that drunk bit, you sound like those retards on that HBO that y'all did.  Oh, okay.  The little Wizard of Oz.  Oh, the Wizard of Oz audio?  Right, the Wizard of Oz audio.  Y'all sound just like them.  Yeah, I like that bit.  I'm not giving up on that one yet.  Thanks, Becky.  Uh-uh.  All right.  Let's get back to Rich Voss and Jimmy.  Was that legit?  Oh, yeah.  First of all, I started peeing, and he wasn't clocking me.  That's why I'm yelling.  I'm like, do you clock in this?  Well, we didn't hear it. 
[03:09:00]  You didn't say go yet.  I said go, and he's throwing a cigarette out the window.  And first of all, how the fuck do I get fired from holding a stopwatch in a urinal?  I could have done play-by-play.  This is after I peed.  I'm good at it.  This is after I peed for 45 seconds before.  You weren't listening to us.  I'm going to smash that record.  We were talking.  We were like, Rich, Rich, and you just did not even answer.  He's trying to piss on our legs.  I set that bar knowing I could go well over two, though.  Dude, I peed like an animal.  This competition has just begun, Jimmy.  I peed like an animal.  I spun in a circle once, too.  I got through the floor.  Yeah, he did drip.  I fucking aimed.  Yeah.  Was it dribbling? 
[03:09:30]  We got to have rules now.  No, no.  As long as the flow, as long as you're going, legitimately.  You can't be just dripping.  He spun.  He took two phone numbers.  He was fucking good.  All right.  Listen to this guy, Kobe.  Kobe, what's up?  Yeah, you guys got nothing with this long piss, and I can piss over a car.  Swear to God.  All right.  Here's the deal.  You get video of that and send it into the show.  Then we'll believe you.  I am not bullshitting you.  Well, then do it.  Send in the video, and we'll throw it on our website, and it'll be downloaded all over the 
[03:10:00]  world.  How tall are you?  14 feet.  I'm 5'7".  5'7"?  All right.  We'll see.  Can you piss over?  You know what?  You know what I do?  I pinch the end of my dick like you do a garden hose, and the fucker just blow it.  I've gone across gravel roads out in the country.  Well, make a video of that.  It would be hilarious.  I'll make a deal with you.  All right.  All right.  I'll do it.  All right.  Landon safely.  This weekend, we'll see if he can piss over a car in Albany.  When I'm up in Albany, I'll have him come up there.  No, February 24th, 25th, I'm there.  You're there, too?  February 24th, 25th, yes.  Yeah, and I'm there this weekend.  No, you're not.  February 24th, 25th. 
[03:10:30]  No, I'm not.  Can I piss now?  Yeah, we got to go to break.  Yes, I'll pee again.  Well, Steve Martin was on TV this morning on Good Morning America.  Thank God for that, right?  Talking about the Pink Panther.  It's time to start promoting that piece of shit.  He knows it's a piece of shit.  What a shameless asshole. 
[03:11:00]  Bucket of shit.  A bucket of shit.  And he's a fellow comedian.  Why would you do that?  I don't get it.  Why would you do that?  He's such a funny guy, and he's such a good actor.  He hasn't comeded in how long?  I know.  It was Peter Sellers' thing.  Have some fucking respect.  What are you doing?  Why don't you remake Citizen Kane while you're at it, shit face?  Yeah, that would be a good idea.  Exactly.  Yeah, redo that.  It'll tell you what an asshole you are. 
[03:11:30]  So here's Steve talking about and explaining his character.  The remake of the Pink Panther.  Let me explain his character.  I'm Steve.  Picture what Peter Sellers did.  Remove all the humor.  It's God awful.  It's going to be one of the worst movies ever made.  Well, The Honeymooners.  Oh, speaking of remakes, we forgot to talk about that one earlier.  Yeah.  The good old Honeymooners remake.  Let's hear this one.  What does he say?  And so he remains triumphant, and he's now, of course, working the other side of the law, 
[03:12:00]  solving crimes as Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther.  And the big premiere is this week in New York.  Beyoncé co-starring in the movie.  She was with us yesterday.  Sassy.  And the two stars there, they were together.  What a glamour couple.  Friday night.  Yes.  And what you were wearing was divine.  Thank you very, very much.  It was.  So welcome.  I was trying to get her out of the pictures, but I couldn't.  So you.  It's so interesting to go to a premiere and the camera's on you, and you feel them all  go. 
[03:12:30]  She is absolutely.  I got here by cable this morning.  Yeah, you did.  I did, yeah.  You just swooped right in.  Usually it's in the car, and I just put up a cable on it.  Well, everybody's going to do that from now on.  You turned this down initially.  You were reluctant to do it?  A Pink Panther?  Yeah.  Well, it's a little spooky to play such a great and famous role, but, you know, you  get over it, and I realized I was going to be working with some people I'd just worked  with, Cheaper by the Dozen, Sean Levy, the director, and we had a good sense of, you  know, working together.  Rumor has it that you found him, that you found him growing your own mustache, and then 
[03:13:00]  you found him physically, and once you find someone physically.  Oh, when you say found him, I didn't know what you meant.  Clouseau.  Yeah, you mean, you know, inhabited the character.  Yeah, I really, I, the mustache came later, because that takes a while to grow.  I didn't want one of those...  Excuse me, can you pause this?  Motherfucker.  De Niro put on 80 pounds to do Raging Bull, and you're trying to do method acting by growing  a mustache?  Something he could do in five days? 
[03:13:30]  I know.  Fucking Arabic women do it all the time.  I'm not even that hairy.  I could grow a mustache.  All right, I'll give you a week.  Six months, maybe.  No, I could do it in a week to ten days.  I found the character.  I didn't shave for three days, and there it was.  There's an involved role.  There you go.  Intern Bill, five minutes.  He grows the mustache.  When Bill shaves, as he's shaving, it's actually growing behind the razor.  Fucking chimp he is.  This is just like Christian Bale in The Machinist.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  Of course. 
[03:14:00]  I didn't want one of those paste-ons.  It always makes your lip very stiff, so you have no expression on your face.  But first thing I did was work on the accent.  And once I felt comfortable with the accent, the rest of it fell together.  The physical part, I felt really good about it.  I'm trying to decide my favorite words, like stiff.  Stiff.  Stiff?  Yes.  I've got the stiff.  What do you do when you say stiff?  Yes.  With a stir.  Ah, that is hysterical.  It's like the original.  Absolute confidence with his complete incompetence.  Well, it's one of the great lessons of comedy is that many of the characters we love have really unlikable qualities. 
[03:14:30]  When you think about Jack Benny, who is cheap, stingy, arrogant, and selfish.  When you think of Clouseau, who is bumbling, arrogant, and bossy.  And you think of Steve Martin, who is smug and thieving and old and boring.  It's not your role.  This hits a nerve with Jimmy Norton, everyone.  It's fucking Peter Sellers.  Well, it should.  And there's no reason to do it. 
[03:15:00]  He's a big star.  He's a great actor, Steve Martin.  He's a funny guy.  Fucking to do this is a disgrace.  It's a disgrace to Peter Sellers.  Really annoys me.  To redo it, it's stealing.  Yes.  Fuck, man.  Why don't I take some Pryor's best material and do it and say,  I'm just doing it in this accent, because I'd look like an asshole.  That's why I don't do it.  And you'd be Carlos Mancia.  Exactly. 
[03:15:30]  Hey, I like Carlos.  Okay.  That was hurtful.  Okay.  Carlo, can you teach me to bumble around and steal a French accent?  All right, here we go.  Reviewing Panther clip and teaching Diane Sawyer how to talk like his character.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't.  That's got to be a goof by Danny.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  You've got a clip in which the accent is his...  Yes.  He's coming to New York from Paris, and he wants to learn to speak with a flawless American accent. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, no.  So he hires an accent coach to teach him how to speak with a flawless American accent.  Is this the hamburger bit?  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Here it goes.  Hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  It's not damburger.  Hamburger.  I'm not saying damburger.  I said I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy the hamburger.  Hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  Maybe we should stop.  We don't quit.  We do not quit.  Again.  Again. 
[03:16:30]  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  I would like to buy a hamburger.  The burger.  She can barely laugh.  She's mustering up a fake laugh there.  Oh, my God. 
[03:17:00]  Okay, can you teach somebody who doesn't know how to do it?  Absolutely.  He couldn't even teach himself.  Like me, for instance.  Could you teach me to do it?  Well, you know, you have to get the swing with it.  But I have if you want to say, welcome back to good morning, America.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Beck.  Beck.  Beck.  Beck.  Beck.  Welcome back.  Like B-E-C-K.  Welcome back.  To.  To.  Good morning.  Good morning.  America. 
[03:17:30]  America.  That's what I like to hear.  It's not easy.  Welcome back to good morning, America.  Can I try to teach someone, I am a sellout and you're an old cunt.  I am a sellout and you're an old cunt.  Why don't they just get Peter Sellers to do another one, you know?  I am a sellout and you're an old cunt.  You are a sellout and I'm an old cunt.  No.  Because Peter Sellers is too busy making the remake to Weekend at Bernie's.  Oh.  Hey, there you go. 
[03:18:00]  He's pushing Miss Daisy.  Right.  Literally.  Do you understand?  This is such a disgrace.  Someone should remake the jerks on what it's suggesting on the line.  I mean, that's, you know what I mean?  You look at a great Steve Martin movie.  I know, he's got the cheaper way to do it and bringing down the house.  Which were big movies and original characters and stuff.  I know.  Big distinct though.  I think the point you're trying to make is like it's such a great, the movie's great  because of the character that Peter Sellers developed that it's like a shame. 
[03:18:30]  It's a disgusting ripoff.  To redo that.  It's one of those movies where the actor playing the character is the whole movie.  Yes.  You can't replace that actor playing that character.  The Honeymooners with Jackie Gleason.  And just out of respect for a comic actor of Sellers' greatness, you should pay reverence  to that and go, you know what?  It's fucking something you don't touch.  You leave it alone.  I mean, at least Cedric, they did the Honeymooners, which is a sickening disgrace, but they did  a black version.  He didn't just do an impression.  It was at least, this to me is a worse offense, a much worse offense. 
[03:19:00]  Same managers, Jimmy?  Yes.  No.  This is a worse offense.  All right.  Welcome back to Good Mooney.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  America.  Don't do it.  America.  America.  Like Elmer Fudd.  Can you do it?  Let's hear it.  Welcome back.  Welcome back to...  Welcome back to Good Mooney, America.  Welcome back to Good Mooney, America.  What are we talking about?  Oh, my God.  Why is everyone so dense this morning?  It's insane. 
[03:19:30]  God, this is going on and on like an Opie and Anthony bit.  It does.  I hope the crowds line up and fucking laugh.  If you pay to see this movie, you are a dumb motherfucker.  You dick.  Yeah.  You're a dumb motherfucker.  Well, Steve explains how physically demanding the movie was in this next clip.  Oh, well.  Before I let you go, I have to ask, did some of that hurt?  Because of one of Clouseau's trademarks, of course, there is nothing in the neighborhood  he doesn't fall over, trip over, fall into, or mistake for something else. 
[03:20:00]  Well, you know, it's jarring.  You know, I didn't injure myself, but it's jarring.  You know, even falling on a 12-inch pad is, you know, it jars you at this age.  But it's so much fun.  You know, once they say action, you're 14 again, you know, and then when they say cut, you're 60.  You know.  Well, I love what you said, that you'll do another one, even if it requires hip replacements,  in order to do it. 
[03:20:30]  You will not be doing another one, Mr. Martin.  By the way, the beautiful thing, this is really interesting behind-the-scenes stuff.  I feel like I'm watching Hearts of Darkness.  Where it takes for nothing!  There will be, there won't be another one.  Of course there won't be.  This thing is going to be one of the biggest bombs.  Maybe Diane Sawyer can play him.  I don't know, I fucking, every time I think it's a bomb, it winds up making 80 million.  The public is dumb.  Yeah.  Oh, the honeymooners.  They didn't get away with it.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:21:00]  Let's just say we're black, too.  Yeah, the black films make less.  All these rubes would be like, oh, Steve Martin's so funny.  Cheaper by the dozen.  Let's go see it.  Let's go see bringing down the house with the saucy black girl.  Beyonce.  She's saucy.  I only want to see fucking, this is Pink Panther, if Shirley Hemphill were alive and playing  his love interest, and all she said was, eat my ass, white motherfucker.  Hemphill.  Yes, that was her name. 
[03:21:30]  Shirley Hemphill.  Hemphill.  Let's go to Anthony.  Hemphill?  Yeah.  Oh, excuse me.  Shirley Hemphill.  Shirley Hemphill.  Yes.  So, P-H is Hemphill.  Hemphill.  Yeah, it wasn't Hemphill.  It was Hemphill.  You're wrong.  Hemphill.  I can't help either of you here.  I don't know.  Shirley Hemphill.  I don't care.  I called her something completely different.  Yeah, one word, simple.  Patrice.  No, it's not Shirley Hemphill.  Is it?  I don't know.  Now you don't know.  Now I don't know.  Well, why don't you just call somebody on the phone and see? 
[03:22:00]  You fucking dope.  Let's go to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to call Jimmy out on this.  Sure.  He's bitching about this, and yet if someone jumped up and offered him $10 million to do  the role, he'd be right there putting on that coat.  But he's not Steve Martin.  First of all, let's understand, sir.  I'd do it for $500,000.  There you go.  And also, what I'm saying is Steve Martin's in a position.  He hosted the Oscars.  Steve Martin's a major fucking player, man.  He has decision-making ability where he can go not. 
[03:22:30]  He gets scripts.  He has an audition.  They hand him scripts.  And he's got enough money where he doesn't have to worry about paying a mortgage and  stuff like that.  When you're at a point where you're fucking turning scripts down, where they say, look,  please do this.  Nope.  Please do this.  Nope.  Please do this.  Okay.  To me, you have accountability.  They keep raising the price.  Yeah.  I understand he doesn't do this for money, dude.  It's just still a disgrace, though.  You don't see Gary Oldman doing this shit.  No.  All right.  Let's move on.  And that's not an excuse just because I would do it.  I'm a fucking dirty dick joke artist from Jersey. 
[03:23:00]  We missed a great story in the paper today, by the way.  Heather Locklear and Rich Sambora, they're separating after, I don't know, like 10 or 11  years of marriage or something like that.  Listen, listen why.  Sexy Notes Sinks, Sambora.  Heather Locklear and Richie Sambora were working through a rough patch in their marriage due  mostly to the demands of two busy careers.  Then, sources say, a suggestive email sent to Sambora by an acquaintance of the couple 
[03:23:30]  became a final straw in Locklear's decision to seek a divorce, People Magazine reports.  Locklear found the email.  Oops.  Which contained provocative pictures of the female, a close friend of the pair said.  Though the woman had long been a sore subject, said the source, Locklear never thought she  and Sambora had actually been, she never thought that Sambora and this lady were romantic together  or whatever.  Whatever conclusions Locklear has now drawn from the photos, they were, her friend believes, 
[03:24:00]  the deciding factor.  She's devastated, the friend said.  Absolutely devastated.  Aw.  Too bad.  How many guys you shoot down in high school?  Good for you, Rich.  Stick it wherever you can.  You're a fucking rock guitarist.  Fuck everything that walks.  But he's saying, Richie's saying nothing ever happened, that he never asked for the pictures.  But this lady sent the naked pictures on her own.  A lot of people use that defense.  My story of the day, teen using restroom falls out a bus window.  What?  This is classic.  A New York City teenager fell out of the window of a moving bus while using the restroom Tuesday 
[03:24:30]  and landed on the New York State Thruway.  State police said, Jose Gonzalez, 17, lost his balance when the chartered bus swerved to change lanes.  It was unclear how fast the bus was going.  Gonzalez was taken to Albany Medical Center for treatment and police said he'll recover.  He fell onto the shoulder of the Thruway near exit 23 southbound.  He had been with some lobby group on the issue of AIDS up in Albany, and they were driving back. 
[03:25:00]  So he goes into the bathroom, one of these buses, and is there a window in the bathroom?  I don't know.  Or is it some kind of a, like, corrugated or kind of window you can't really see through?  You ever been on a bus?  Yeah, it doesn't sound like that's possible.  I don't know.  And then it's swerved.  He's probably taken a leak, loses his balance.  The window comes loose, and he flies out of the bus.  You know, dick in hand, just tumbling down the road of the Thruway. 
[03:25:30]  I hope it's cocked and scraped against the concrete, doing 40.  Oh, but that has to be a, um, sucks to be you.  Yeah.  The guy holding the stopwatch is going to get thrown out, thank God.  Maybe they were timing it and being reckless.  I'm going to take out your record tomorrow, Jimmy.  Voss was by the window smoking.  That's why it was opened.  Yeah.  Looking at him.  I like that. 
[03:26:00]  Steve's new entry music?  I don't know.  Someone sent it in.  It's really funny.  You aren't coming here to fart, are you?  No, no.  What are you doing, Jimmy?  What are you doing?  Looking at the girls.  Jimmy has a Breathe Right strip on his asshole.  It holds it open so farts can get out more easily.  I didn't guess.  I was just looking at chicks.  Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Yeah, hey, I got to defend boss.  Shirley Hemple, the H, is silent. 
[03:26:30]  It's not silent, you homo.  Her name is Emphil?  No, Hemple.  So the H was silent.  You know what?  Even if Voss is right, so what?  He's still a dope.  Not bad.  One for 800.  Exactly.  And he didn't even know he was right.  He just didn't realize P and H are normally silent.  She's not spelt with a P in front of her name.  Hemp?  What is it?  H-E-M-P-H-I-L.  I can't talk to her anymore.  Emphil?  Don't acknowledge it.  H-E-M-P-H-I-L-L.  Spell it. 
[03:27:00]  Hempel.  That sounds like hemphil.  Of course it's hemphil.  H-E-M-P-H-I-L.  It could be hemphil.  The H is silent.  I don't know.  Hemphil.  It's not.  You're a sithead.  All right, let's go to Dan in Philly.  Dan, what's going on today?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say that what I learned today was that a lot of girls try anal first.  Yeah, we learned that.  We did.  Let's go to Ed in Jersey.  Ed?  I learned that Jimmy is full of shit because nobody can piss that long if they're not squeezing 
[03:27:30]  the tip of their dick.  That's not true, sir.  I did pee that long.  I wouldn't lie about that.  You're a fucking fool of it, Jimmy.  The new record is a minute 57.  I'm taking on that record tomorrow morning.  I hope he's taking on that record.  I'll take on that record.  We're going helmet to helmet.  Jack in New York.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Happy New Year, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Today I learned that Opie blew a mic.  And out.  There was an out.  You blew him?  I blew a mic.  Out.  All right.  Punch it out. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle.  Okay.  Yeah, when are you guys going to play Stoner Spelling Bee again?  We haven't played Stoner Spelling Bee in a long time.  We haven't.  A week from Tuesday, it was scheduled.  Shut up.  Yeah, man.  You got to call me.  Lying sack of shit.  All right.  We'll play Stoner Spelling Bee in the near future.  Seth in New York.  What's up?  Hey, I wouldn't say that playing hockey is like washing an uncut cock.  There's too many steps to doing it.  Holy Jesus.  No, it can't end on that. 
[03:28:30]  No, no.  No.  And that's how it ends today, unfortunately.  Rich Voss, quick plug.  Real quick.  Albany this weekend.  Albany this weekend.  Where?  Comedy works.  Comedy works.  Comedy works.  Comedy works.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  Sorry.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
