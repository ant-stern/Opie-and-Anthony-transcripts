<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of K-Rock's reformatting to Top 40 "Now FM," mocking their promotional stunts and perceived competition with Z100.  The hosts then discussed the firing of their production staff member, Tim, and his subsequent appearance on a rival station's promotional material. This led to a rambling discussion encompassing several unrelated topics.  They recounted a plane experiencing engine failure and debris falling over Queens, Bernie Madoff's guilty plea and sentencing, and Howard K. Stern's arrest in connection with Anna Nicole Smith's death.  The segment was punctuated by frequent offensive and vulgar remarks, including a lengthy, crude rant about one host's mother, and an anecdote detailing an awkward encounter with Jerry Seinfeld. No guests were present in studio during this portion.

The show then transitioned to listener calls about radio station format changes.  Callers shared various methods stations used to announce format flips, such as repeatedly playing songs like David Bowie's "Changes," R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World as We Know It," and an unspecified hip-hop track, reading aloud from a phone book for days, or playing construction sounds. One caller even recounted receiving death threats after a station switched to country music.  The hosts then digressed into a discussion of a picture of women in spandex, using highly offensive and vulgar language to describe their physical attributes. This was followed by a lengthy, graphic description and reaction to images of extreme male genital modification, further characterized by vulgar commentary and explicit language, ranging from shock and disgust to morbid fascination.  Again, no guests were explicitly mentioned as being in studio for this segment.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  This is Heath Ledger.  I mean, there was going to be no surprise there.  It was so obvious he was going to win.  And I was disappointed.  Boy, and I thought we were going to see a corpse.  Too soon.  Too soon.  Did you quit smoking yet?  No, I didn't quit smoking.  Why don't you guys attack him like you attack me?  Quit smoking.  We don't care if he dies.  I don't care about you.  Why don't you shove it?  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother takes it.  Your mother, that whore. 
[00:04:30]  That whore.  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes it in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Good and tog.  Good and tog.  Good morning.  Welcome to the open answer show.  Been a new y'all morning.  I'm going to scrape yogurt cans all morning.  And I'm going to start enjoying grapes.  Grapes are delicious, by the way.  I love grapes.  They're irresistible.  Oh, a little, a little.  I'm going to tell Kenny not to bring me any, though.  All right.  It's fine.  I don't know.  Something.  What could I have that's not as gushy as a grape? 
[00:05:30]  Mark Mellows.  A raisin.  Cotton candy.  Mark Mellows.  Bring me cotton candy.  That would go.  No, you know what?  Not squishy.  How about, um...  How about some...  I can't think.  What's your talk about?  Old woman uterus.  That's crunchy.  I wasn't going to go quite so hurtful and barbaric.  I was just taking potato chips.  Oh, a little milk. 
[00:06:00]  What?  Is that kashi?  Kashi.  No.  Yes, we are here.  It is Friday.  The 13th.  Look out.  Is it really?  Yes.  Another one.  Wasn't there just one?  How does that happen?  They're lining up lately.  That's a bad omen. 
[00:06:30]  For who?  I think.  We already had our bad omen.  The market.  Ah.  Another plane having problems, huh?  Yeah, apparently an American Airlines MD-83, which they say is much better than the MD-80.  It's three more better.  No, those American Airlines planes suck.  Yeah.  They just look old when you're on them.  They really do.  They have too much headroom.  They have ashtrays.  They should not be in the...  Ashtrays.  They do.  I know. 
[00:07:00]  A lot of the American Airlines planes have ashtrays because they're old school planes.  Yeah.  I don't trust the American Airlines planes anymore.  The MD-83 is supposed to be, what they say, is an updated version of the MD-80.  This one was built in, I think, the 90s, so it's not all that old, but apparently something  happened.  One of the engines, the turbo blades came apart.  It didn't go through the shroud, but crap blew out the back of the engine.  The engine was dead.  They went from LaGuardia to Kennedy. 
[00:07:30]  The guy was able to make a landing over there.  But on the way, he's just dropping shit off of his plane.  And when, you know, when you lose a hubcap, you just watch it roll over to the gutter.  Wow.  When you're losing engine turbine blades, they seem to fall through everything.  Car windows, house roofs.  They were, amazingly, nobody was hit.  But a little property damage going on.  He called it catastrophic engine failure.  That was the term the pilot used to do. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my goodness.  We experienced catastrophic engine failure.  He didn't say that to the passengers, did he?  Could you leave the word catastrophic out?  It's like yesterday when we were talking about morbidly obese.  You can just say obese.  But catastrophic, that word never needs to be used when you're in the air.  Because that means that everyone could die.  Why not just tell them, you know, tell them, ah, screw's loose.  Yeah.  And we're going back to the airport.  Something happened to the engine.  At that point, you don't need to know that much info if you're possibly going to crash and die anyway. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Catastrophic.  That's crazy to announce that to the passengers.  Crazy.  They went from one airport to another.  They have to dump fuel.  How do they, like, I guess when you have to land heavy, you can.  Yeah.  But when you have a full load of fuel, isn't that, how do you land?  Oh, you're going to hit hard.  Yeah.  It's going to be a nice little boom.  Yeah.  But he had no choice.  We hear that, right?  Yeah.  I think it all depends on the circumstances, too. 
[00:09:00]  I think if you have an engine out.  No, I mean, do you hear that in your headphones?  No, what is it?  Oh, it's a rumbling noise.  Hold on.  Oh, it's cool.  It's like the wind's blowing here.  Yeah, it's like we're broadcasting the wind.  We're here outside.  We're in the woods.  What is that?  That's really annoying.  Do you hear that?  Yes.  That's cool.  Oh, now it's gone.  Now it's gone.  What happened?  Who turned off something?  Who's mic was on?  Somebody made a mistake.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened? 
[00:09:30]  What happened?  What happened?  You've had a free ride for a long time.  Now we're here live every day at 6.  We heard a crumbly noise.  No more hanging around watching karate movies.  Oh, that was the other.  I'm sorry.  I don't hear anything.  No, now it's gone.  No, it's gone.  Now it's gone.  Okay.  And then it was gone.  You could have came in as the hero.  Like, oh, I do a little of this and a little of that.  Are you guys okay now?  But instead it's gone.  Yeah, it is gone.  All right.  I don't know.  I'll be back. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  There you go as far as.  Sure you will be.  I have to apologize to a fan.  Uh-oh.  Why?  No, no, no.  Never say sorry for that.  Please, be happy for the weight loss.  It's not my fault.  You know, I was a snake when you picked me up.  I didn't give it to myself.  Exactly.  I pass it along.  I was at the cell last night and I did a spot.  And Seinfeld had gone on.  Once in a while he comes in.  He actually goes on.  Jerry?  Occasionally, yeah.  Oh. 
[00:10:30]  You saw him last night?  Yeah.  Nice.  And he came in and I didn't speak to him.  You apologize to him when you say a fan?  No.  Oh.  I thought he knew you.  I don't think he's a fan.  No, he does.  But I walk in.  I didn't see him.  He just, I went on two people after him.  He was talking to Colin or whatever.  So I went on and did my set.  What did his car need another push start?  Yes.  I saw Colin walking up the steps with like a spare tire and some lug nuts.  You know.  Well, it's Jerry. 
[00:11:00]  He could always help me out.  And I'm walking out.  Then Colin goes on after me.  So I guess him and Jerry are upstairs talking.  So I'm walking out the door and there's a fan there and he starts talking to me.  And he's like a guy in a suit.  And he goes, hey, I just wanted to say.  And then I saw Seinfeld in the hallway.  And he put on a set and goes, hey.  And I was engaging this fan and I walked away from him.  Oh, no.  Dude, I walked away from him.  But the fans got to understand. 
[00:11:30]  But I didn't realize until after that was brutally fucking.  I heard the guy tell off.  Rude.  He was going, hey, I listened to you walk away.  I could hear him going every morning as my hand went out.  But Jerry.  I didn't even go.  I was like, I fucking was so rude.  So my apologies, dude.  I didn't mean to be a dick.  Oh, he must have told so many friends.  I'm sure he understood.  I was at the cell.  I saw Jimmy.  I started talking to him. 
[00:12:00]  Dude, the guy just walked away from me.  So if you're listening, dude, my apologies.  I didn't, you know.  He's not listening.  Not today.  I know.  He hates you.  Well, that happened last night to your friend at the cellar.  I didn't mean to be a dick.  I just got very nervous.  That's funny.  When the hand of Jerry goes out, you have to walk up and shake the hand of Jerry.  Yeah.  And then he went in and watched Colin.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  That's why he was down in that.  Was he chuckling at Colin?  I didn't notice.  I went right back upstairs and went and saw my girlfriend.  I would look and see if Jerry chuckles at Colin.  Oh, he loves Colin. 
[00:12:30]  Does he?  Loves Colin.  He doesn't.  Well, how much does he love him?  He's not helping him out.  No, it's not true.  And putting him in a project or something.  Yeah, I'm going to be the new Kramer.  Yeah, we wanted to see Colin in some kind of Jerry Seinfeld project.  Let me tell you something.  That's a testament.  Didn't Seinfeld do that bee movie?  Where was Colin's part?  Well, he modeled the bees after Colin's shape.  Yeah, no kidding.  Round and pesky.  Pesky.  You know, guys.  Wow, the Jerry.  Yeah.  That's a biggie. 
[00:13:00]  But I was so, I even saw my girlfriend last night, I felt so bad.  Like, I really fucking.  No, people got to understand that one.  It was so blatant, though, dude.  Like, I normally would finish, like, I wouldn't start a sentence with you.  Right.  And then as you're talking, walk completely.  Just walk away.  If you do the same thing because a homeless guy was saying hi to you, then I would understand.  But the fans got to understand in that, you know.  Yeah, it's Jerry.  How about this?  Say hi to me, all right?  And then I want you to say, I listen to you every morning.  And I'll say, when I say Jerry, that means I'm walking away. 
[00:13:30]  Because it's a visual thing.  Uh-huh.  But I hope you play Jerry.  And you play the fan.  You say, you say hi.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, man.  How are you?  Good, man.  I listen to you every morning.  I was so fucking rude.  And then did you do anything but shake his hand?  Or did you have a little conversation with Jerry?  No, you don't have conversations with Jerry.  He was walking in.  And I congratulate him on the new show.  And I told him I was doing a lot of money with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Because he don't.  Where did he go?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  And then he said thanks to you.  Oh, yeah, Julia. 
[00:14:00]  I did that show a thousand times.  I know that.  Believe me.  I was embarrassed that I said that.  I know what to say.  Oh.  And then in the middle of telling him that, he saw someone else and walked away from you.  As long as it wasn't Bob Kelly.  I knew that.  Not you.  I saw that dummy upstairs.  I was telling him how we were talking about how he was going to fuck Sam.  Oh.  Graphically.  Yeah, that had me laughing yesterday.  And he was like, so?  Yeah.  He enjoyed it.  Oh, he probably came up with his own fantasies.  Dude, yeah.  In the back.  Yeah.  Oh.  Dude.  So we got the plane debris plinking all over Queens. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  That's scary.  Yeah.  A whole engine out.  But that's why you got two.  Yeah.  You used the other one to land safely somewhere.  In Sully's case, Bolton went out, hence the river.  Didn't Sully have a third engine or no?  No.  Two.  I have no doubt it's a matter of time that another one of these dummy pilots are going  to do the same Sully thing with much different results.  Yeah.  Tragic results.  Dude, I could do this river thing.  Yeah.  When I'm falling asleep at night, you hear the planes going right over our buildings. 
[00:15:00]  They're all Sully tight.  You know, they're all Sully planes, basically.  Yeah.  And I'm like, man, one of these dummies are up there and they're going to have a problem  one night and it's going to just cartwheel into either one of these buildings.  I'm going to be the next hero.  I'm going to save everybody.  We're all going to be on the wings and get rescued.  The flaming cartwheel of just burning bodies, landing, washing up all over the place.  And then they're picking up floating bloated bodies for the next month.  Oh, God.  To everyone's horror.  Oh, we found another one today. 
[00:15:30]  Another body believed to be from the airline disaster washing up on Manhattan's shores.  Fisheries thought it was a doll.  Yeah, they always think it's a doll.  Dummies.  A life-size fucking doll floating around.  A chard.  And we finally got Bernie Madoff because that's what we've been trying to do when we're not  doing our radio show.  Yes.  So we finally got him.  He pled guilty.  He apologizes.  Whatever.  What a doody.  Set the jail in handcuffs and he's going away for the rest of his life. 
[00:16:00]  This is guaranteed.  Yeah.  This is not one of those things where everyone's going to be surprised and go, what?  He got six months probation?  They pulled his bail.  He's in a metropolitan correctional facility.  Right.  In a small, very small cell.  Right.  They wouldn't let him post or stay out on his $10 million bail.  Right.  So they shoved him in there until his sentencing, which is until June.  So he's in this little cell, no matter what kind of a white-collar prison they send him 
[00:16:30]  to, but I don't think they're going to do that either.  This guy is just hated.  He's got to be made an example of.  I think so.  I think to help the economy, to keep people from thinking they could do this and get away  with it, they really have to nail this guy.  Right.  And he made a fool out of the government.  He made a fool out of them.  Yeah.  Out of the entire stock market because he just did it for all these years.  Red flags were up.  Went for so long.  People were ratting him out.  I have a feeling a lot of the boys down there kind of knew what was going on.  Business as usual for a while. 
[00:17:00]  I think we're all going to be taking a much closer look at what the boys are doing down  on Wall Street in the coming years.  There's probably some petrified sons of bitches down there that are in the same circumstance  going, when's my turn?  When are they going to catch me?  Yeah, because Bernie said it was just a matter of time.  He was living a life where he's like, any day this stupid door could be knocked in and  they take me away.  But he made it pretty far.  How many years did he do this?  Oh, my God.  A couple of decades, right?  Yeah.  A couple of decades.  He was wondering if they were ever going to catch up with him. 
[00:17:30]  He mentioned that he started it out small and he couldn't get out of it.  And that's probably the truth.  He started it out, boom, boom, left, right, you know, get this one, get that one.  And all of a sudden he kind of realized it was, what was the quote?  He implicated no one.  I'm actually grateful this opportunity.  Oh, no, sorry.  I don't know where it is.  I'm actually grateful of going to jail.  Paraphrase, Jimmy, paraphrase.  Well, he was basically saying that he started doing it and then he figured he would just 
[00:18:00]  get out of it and pay his investors and keep some money for himself.  And then he basically realized he couldn't do it.  He could not get out of it.  It was too big.  And then it just snowballed.  And he always knew this day would come, which is probably true.  Oh, here it is.  With a Ponzi scheme, you can't get out of it.  It's the typical pyramid.  Yeah, and that's exactly what this quote is.  When I began the Ponzi scheme, I believed it would end shortly and I would be able  to extricate, right?  I think so, yeah.  Myself and my clients from the scheme, he said.  However, this proved difficult and ultimately impossible.  And as the years went by, I realized that my arrest and this day would inevitably come. 
[00:18:30]  You know what, though?  But he had a hell of a life.  Sure did.  Yeah.  If he would have ended it sooner and just screwed a few investors over, he probably would  have gotten some kind of probation or things like that.  But it was driven by greed.  When you see that much money pouring in, you don't just stop it because you can't get out  of it.  You could stop it at any time and then go, wow, I'm in trouble.  Maybe you could have stopped it in the beginning. 
[00:19:00]  But I think...  Yeah, but if there's 10...  Let's say you screwed over 10 investors and you realize there's 10 people now that I cannot  pay off.  Right.  I've paid off some people and now I'm at 10 people that it's impossible for me to pay  off.  I just don't have the resources.  And if I keep going and get 20 people to pay that 10, then there's going to be 20 people  I can't pay off.  Then I'm going to need 40 people to pay off the 20.  That's how it works.  Right.  Pyramid.  Right.  But if he would have stopped earlier, I do believe he probably would have gotten probation. 
[00:19:30]  He got in too far, I think.  He got in way too far and I think it was based completely on greed.  He was living the life of a drug dealer.  The life of Riley, I say.  He was living the life of a really good drug dealer where those guys, they're living their  lives like, wow, this is a great life, but any day they're going to kick my door down  and take me away or I'm going to get shot, something.  Yeah, you don't know.  You don't know.  And it sounds like that's exactly what he was doing.  Mr. Madoff, it's the police department.  Hello.  Boy, that must have given him some butterflies when that knock came on the door. 
[00:20:00]  Might have been a relief.  Oh, you think?  In a weird way, it might have been a relief because the stress of him wandering.  I'm like, what the fuck?  When you're 70, you have to, on some level, think, I might make it to the end with this.  Yeah, I might just live my life.  Yeah.  No.  He's been married 45 years, the same woman.  I mean, it's like their whole life is together.  And he probably started doing this in the 60s or the early 70s.  Think of your whole life.  From the time Kiss was big.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was like, you know, he was doing this. 
[00:20:30]  How about this?  Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon 36 years ago today.  He was well into his positive.  He was already doing the positive.  Wow.  Boy, he made it a while.  Look, I don't want to be 70 years old and die in prison.  Turn my back on you, Ruger.  Nice instant feedback coming in, going back to the plane thing.  Have you noticed how many planes are having problems these days?  That's a yayo, it looks like.  Yep.  Yeah.  Well, because the planes are getting a bit older.  We've got to ship those dumb planes off to other countries.  Turkey or somewhere. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  Also, I think the airlines, you know, they make their cutbacks and it's in all the departments.  The maintenance might not be as up to par, you thinking?  I'm thinking it's not just the ticket women that are getting laid off.  Probably some mechanics.  Right.  Oops, I forgot to torque that down properly.  And there goes a turbine blade.  Those things spin maybe, you know, 10, 20 rotations per minute. 
[00:21:30]  Perhaps.  I thought it was more than that.  Perhaps.  More than that literal gym.  Well, this just in.  This is good news.  Joe H. from Pittsburgh.  We got you this story.  We gave you this story a while ago.  Remember that old wrestler that had the Alzheimer's and killed his fellow Alzheimer's patient?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  His name was Greg Gagne.  83 year old wrestler.  Greg Gagne will not be charged for killing his nursing home friend.  This is an update.  Because he was eating his grapes too loud. 
[00:22:00]  So he's got a good excuse for what.  That isn't what the story is.  No, it says it right there.  So that's very possible.  Very good news.  By the way.  Charges filed.  No charges filed.  We lost Tim.  Remember Tim?  I don't know.  Tim.  We were sort of heading that way yesterday when all hell broke loose.  But Tim was shown the door as well.  CBS said beat it.  Did they fucking fire Tim? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Scram, Tim.  Beat it.  Oh, yeah.  Hit the bricks.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's gone.  Take you and all your silly voices and beat it.  You guys hit the road.  Right.  Do you think he'd have fit into the format production-wise?  No.  He was a soldier.  Oh, whatever.  He's a good egg.  I like Tim.  A lot of good eggs.  Like, whatever.  Out.  Out.  In the end, it just comes down to this.  It's such a silly, stupid business. 
[00:23:00]  Get out.  I used to encourage the youngsters to get into this business.  I thought it was amazing.  I used to be.  I don't know if I can encourage anybody anymore, which isn't cool, because it did right by  me, but I don't know.  It's rough out there.  And then the one place you go to, like, learn about radio, they close their doors without  even telling anybody.  They lock the door.  A bunch of dumb Connecticut School of Broadcasting people trying to get in to go to their stupid  class.  I was never a fan of that place. 
[00:23:30]  And the door's locked.  I always had to bite my lip about that place.  But doesn't that show you?  That prepares you for radio.  That's the way it works.  No kidding.  That's how it works.  That's how it works.  See, this is a great lesson.  You think you're heading towards something nice, and all of a sudden they say, nope,  sorry.  Your key doesn't work anymore.  Yeah, it's a perfect lesson.  By the way, JFK is blowing up, too.  WJFK and DC, I believe, is ending April 1st.  Are they turning into the top 40?  I don't know what they're turning into, but that's where my hurt was that they were going  to blow up.  You know, the sports junkies were very cool guys, and the guys after them were very cool 
[00:24:00]  guys.  It's too bad Howard had to move to satellite, because all these stations would have went  on, and they would have been prosperous.  Oh yeah, even in this economy, and with every other medium that people use to get their music  and entertainment.  Delusional.  Certainly would have been the same.  Anyway, Tim.  Big Olin Dukes, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Those guys were cool.  Yeah, very cool guys, man.  You know who ended up being cool was, well, Mike from Don and Mike was cool. 
[00:24:30]  Don was all right in the end.  The sports junkies.  Sports junkies?  They were great.  Yeah, they were big supporters of the show.  They ended up calling themselves the junkies, I think.  Yeah.  All gone?  I heard that it's April 1st, they're flipping the station to something else.  What do you think there's something else?  Probably now, either now or...  The safe pop music thing they're doing everywhere else.  Now or Amp, yeah.  I hate having to listen to the promos for it on WINS, because I listen to WINS, the new station  here in New York on the way in, and they're doing, you know,  listen to 92, blah, blah, blah, and I'm just going, ugh, and they're playing all that 
[00:25:00]  crappy music, and...  It hurts.  I think by Monday, we'll be way better.  Way better.  Need the weekend.  Big time, need the weekend.  Hey, the K-Rock Flip, we never played that yesterday, too, and we were heading in that  direction, but here's Tim saying goodbye to the O&A audience.  Oh, no.  Hey, it's Tim Reed, former production guy for Opie and Anthony.  Here at 92.3 K-Rock, your mom's box.  Oh, no.  He said your mom's box. 
[00:25:30]  Does that mean he's fired?  I think so.  Tim's an ass.  Oh, that's great.  Doesn't even acknowledge he's the same guy.  I love it.  That means we're fired, too.  No, he'll just come in with the other voice and say it's, you know, another guy.  I heard Tim was fired. 
[00:26:00]  You're Tim, idiot.  Get out.  Oh, that is funny.  How about Jiven?  Is he all right?  Uh, no, I believe Jiven also did not make the cut.  Well, because he's the dump guy.  It was like, what are you going to dump out of?  Yeah, what are you going to dump out of over there?  They're professionals.  Can I have the Daily News for a second?  Sure.  The Daily News.  There was a big story about it.  I got to apologize to someone by the way.  Oh, what is duty?  I mean, fair is fair on this show, right?  Fair is fair. 
[00:26:30]  The Daily News.  Remember, yesterday we went off on this crazy rant how Howard's not in the news anymore.  That's true.  He's only in the news when his wife's in the news.  When his wife does something.  We did say that.  Well, Howard Stern's in the news, page two of the Daily News.  Wow, how did I miss that?  Oh, wait.  That's Howard K. Stern.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wait a minute.  I got confused.  Stern?  Oh, I thought it was.  Oh.  Oh, it's Howard K. Stern. 
[00:27:00]  It says Stern, two pill prescribing docs charged in fatal OD of Anna Nicole Smith.  Right.  Oh.  What does this have to do with the North Shore Animal League?  No, see, it's a different Stern.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I guess I don't have to apologize.  I Googled myself and saw the name.  It wasn't me.  I guess they arrested this dummy, finally.  Yeah.  Didn't Anna Nicole Smith die like a year and a half ago?  Two years ago.  Two years ago. 
[00:27:30]  It was two years ago.  February 8th, 2007.  Two years ago, they finally arrested Howard K. Stern and two other doctors.  Oh, he got arrested, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was getting her the drugs.  Oh, yeah.  And the doctors were filling these bogus prescriptions, I gather.  She was on everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  Everything.  Everything.  Bye-bye.  Everything's going to be all right this morning.  She must look like shit now. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm still talking, yeah.  Would you?  Oh, God.  With something over my nose.  Oh.  Clothespin.  Clothespin.  An old-time wooden clothespin.  For real, I would, too.  That's a story you get to tell to your grandkids.  That you fucked dead Anna Nicole Smith?  Face.  Howie.  Coke logic.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Here's that story.  Anna Nicole Smith's former boyfriend and two doctors have been charged with conspiracy  to furnish drugs to the former Playboy Playmate before she died of an overdose in 2007. 
[00:28:30]  Prosecutors say her former boyfriend and attorney, Howard K. Stern, and the doctors were charged  Thursday with three felony counts of conspiracy in Los Angeles Superior Court.  A Los Angeles County District Attorney spokeswoman says the three defendants were variously charged  with eight other felonies.  Those include obtaining fraudulent prescriptions and unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance  between June 2004 and January 2007.  That's just two weeks before Smith's death. 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  There you go.  Yikes.  Yeah, that's pretty much, uh, that's the writing on the wall there.  That guy was.  Describe it right before she dies.  That guy was the biggest loser.  What a loser.  Oh, on the show and everything.  Anna Nicole Smith never liked that dude.  No.  Romantically, and he was just there doing whatever he could, could to get her to like him.  Yep.  Supplying her with a dope.  And then he finally figured out, well, if I, if I'm part of this dope thing, I think  I might be able to, you know, get a little romance.  She seems to enjoy dope.  I'll get her some drugs and she'll like me. 
[00:29:30]  Oh shit.  She's dead.  How did it happen?  Tim.  Wow.  They, they took the big boot through that place, huh?  The, the other joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole company, man.  They've, they've literally, you go down the line, there's so many people that have just  fucking gone.  Yeah.  We see like, all right, Corolla left and we got fired and so did, uh, uh, uh, like  is it in Russian Martin and Dallas and all these people, but all their, uh, all their 
[00:30:00]  one market sensations, they started getting rid of one by one and then most of them had  really good ratings still proving that it wasn't a, you know, uh, whatever.  They're just trying, uh, they're trying to do this on the cheap.  Uh, you know, what, what do you, what do you think that, that chick that's over there  now that they were promoing yesterday on the news, what do you think she's pulling  down?  Nothing.  Nothing to spin that crap.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  Do we have the format flip?  Cause those things are always fun to take a listen to.  All right.  They did this with us there when they flipped to K-Rock.  I know.  Remember that?  They did this big, long, stunty music, weird kind of what's happening.  Ooh, we're going to fool the public and we're doing stunting and we'll put sound clips in  that'll hint, hint to what's going on.  And everyone listened to it in the conference room.  We're all sitting there.  And then at the end, oh, this is fantastic.  Oh, bravo. 
[00:31:00]  Finally, a successful station.  And then, you know, fast forward a little bit, fast forward through 18 of, uh, PDs and  other format changes.  Lunatic PDs.  Cunt PDs.  Uh, we went through them all, didn't we?  Yeah.  And then, and then, Hey, new format.  Yeah.  I bet they were all applauding in the conference room yesterday.  Oh, stop already.  This typical radio shit.  You should all just go in there and cross your fingers and hope it works. 
[00:31:30]  I think this could be fun.  Uh, we got a few clips of how they went from rock to pop.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, I think a lot of, a lot of the people, especially that listen to our  show, they're educated enough about radio and this has happened in their town.  Oh yeah.  All of a sudden you hear the construction working noises.  We're building something new.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Is it really new? 
[00:32:00]  Friday at five o'clock we'll unveil what we built.  Oh, what do they mean?  Hey, we need a little bit over here.  What do they mean rebuilding?  That was the best one I ever heard.  And it's just, it's just construction noises for like a day or two.  Like who wants to tune into that crap?  Someone pitched that though and went like, this is a great idea.  What we're going to do is do construction noises.  Right.  Maybe people can help us out there.  There are other ways they like flipped, uh, flip stations.  Might be, might be interesting.  I don't know.  They should just play the sound of a swishing boot. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Uh, hitting asses.  Yeah.  And then flying out the door saying, what am I going to do now?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, this was pretty much the last song or the end of the last song of, um, of rock.  Of rock.  Thank you.  Oh, uh, uh, is that a mysterious clock? 
[00:33:00]  What does that mean?  Oh, I don't know.  It's a time bomb.  Mysterious clock.  Mysterious clock ticking.  Okay.  We'll go for the music.  We need mysterious ticking clock.  What does that represent?  I don't know.  It was the first track I could find on the sound effects CD.  Mysterious ticking clock.  How long did it take for?  You know, they made, you know, they made Tim put all this together.  Oh no.  Yeah.  They made him put it together and then boot him out the door. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  What's up, uh, Sam?  It takes for like four minutes.  It takes for four minutes.  Yeah.  Well, you don't have that time here.  So we just gave you a little piece of it.  That went, that tick, tick, tick was four minutes.  Yeah.  There was, there was like a countdown on the 92.3 now website.  Right.  And so that ticked for the four minutes.  But then after the countdown went to zero, the production on the radio station said 92.3 
[00:34:00]  now is coming in four minutes.  Ah.  So there was an extra four minutes somewhere.  Oh really?  Yeah.  They didn't sync it up right?  No.  Oh, oops.  Oh, first faux pas.  That's perfect.  Believe me for that place.  Never really figuring it out.  Yeah.  I was, I was told also that, uh, yesterday an ONA promo played.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone said an ONA promo played during the day.  Whoopsie. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  And then after four minutes, the ticking stops.  K-Rock listeners are thanked and the website is plugged.  Yeah.  It's very exciting.  I heard their Twitter account is up to 200 followers.  That's pretty impressive.  Wow.  After all this excitement.  Yeah.  All right.  The end of the ticking clock.  Mysterious clock.  Ah.  Whoa.  What's happening?  Beeping.  Rock is dead. 
[00:35:00]  Stand by.  WXRK.  WXRK.  HD1 New York.  Thanks to thousands of loyal listeners for your support over the years.  K-Rock is moving to 92.3 HD2 New York and K-RockRadio.com.  Oh, so they're on, um.  You can still listen online.  You can still listen to K-Rock online.  Yeah.  That's a big thing happening in the business.  And what do they do there? 
[00:35:30]  There's no jocks.  No jocks.  They just play music?  Yeah.  It's an iPod.  Satellite radio.  That you didn't put.  Right.  It's satellite radio.  Without the fucking, without the variety, dickheads.  Wow.  Wow.  That's amazing.  It's an iPod.  You didn't get to put the music in yourself.  It's like putting your iTunes shuffle on, except worse.  And having someone else put the music in for you.  It's like borrowing some guy's laptop who you never met and putting his iTunes on shuffle.  And syncing your iPhone up to his computer. 
[00:36:00]  Yes.  Holy cow.  I don't know these contacts.  No.  Who is this person?  And then what?  What do they do after that there, Sam?  Well, I think then, uh.  I got a track here that says, now FM starts insulting Z100.  Yeah.  The big dog in town.  Oh, here we go.  The gloves are off.  Yeah.  They come in with a bang.  They're like, K-Rock is dead.  92.3.  Now.  Now.  It's not then.  It's not before.  It's now.  All right.  Meaning what's happening now in music?  Now.  Yeah.  Now. 
[00:36:30]  Now.  Some things change.  Some things change.  Some things don't.  The incredible edible Elvis Duran.  Z100 was born in 1983.  Susan, holy potatoes, you're the 100th caller.  CDs weren't in stores yet.  The Walkman was hot.  Ronald Reagan was president.  Holy potatoes.  It's a cold, chillin', icy, illin'.  Elvis Duran was playing music like.  Oh, you feel so fine.  You feel so fine.  You feel my way.  You're out of love.  Not no mystery.  You're Sarah. 
[00:37:00]  You're Sarah.  Holy potatoes.  You're Sarah.  Holy potatoes is right.  We think it's time for something new.  Something a lot more.  Now.  It makes no sense.  You've had the game to yourself for almost 30 years.  But that was then.  In two minutes.  It will be now.  Wow.  Two minutes.  That's horrible.  I'll tell you why it's horrible.  Yeah.  It is.  They're trying to say Z100 is old and all that by, like, referencing 1983, but they're  playing music from today, like now. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  They're doing the now thing.  It's the exact same songs on both stations.  Right, right.  And they're criticizing them for playing hits from that time.  What were you supposed to do?  Play music from now?  Get into the DeLorean?  Get some music from now?  And go back to the 80s and play it?  They're attempting a radio war?  They're going to fight over Lady Gaga?  Their strategy is also somehow the people who used to listen to Z100, who are loyal to 
[00:38:00]  Z100, will hear another radio station say that the station that they like sucks, and so  they'll go, oh!  It does!  I like these guys then.  Yes!  Let's listen to the same music over here.  Yes.  It doesn't make a bit of sense to me, Samuel.  Well, E-Rock, you got something on this?  Steve just said that a lot of this is the old Blink-1027 production that was just revoiced.  Oh, really?  Some of this is stuff that maybe Steve had made way back in the day.  But I don't hear Steve.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Or Kiefer.  So, all right.  Now FM officially begins with?  Well, let's find out.  What song do they start with?  Lady Gaga?  I wish.  The fierce urgency of now.  Urgence.  The fierce urgency of now.  Hi, it's Whitney Stevens.  What's going on, man?  It's T-Pain.  Now.  Hey, this is Justin Timberlake, and you're listening to Now.  It's Usher.  Now.  You know the eyes.  This is Pink.  Turn it up.  Now.  Now.  This is the sound of Now.  The new 92.3 Now FM. 
[00:39:00]  10,000 songs in a row.  You're listening to the new 92.3 Now FM.  Get, get, get, get.  Ooh, gotta get, get.  Ooh, gotta get, get.  Wow.  Ooh, gotta get, get.  I'm reading this because I have no idea.  That's Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas.  It's the latest single by the Black Eyed Peas.  Boom Boom Pow.  The album's not even out yet.  This is Now.  That's like listening to a friend get shot, and then just.  Boom Boom Pow.  It's just over. 
[00:39:30]  Boom Boom Pow.  Boom Boom Pow, baby.  It's just over.  How did all those musicians know about this station?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  All those celebrities already know about Now.  They said Now.  Yeah.  This place must be the place to be and listen to.  Usher is just sitting there.  Usher.  Now.  That's crazy.  They all knew about it.  JT is just like, I listen to Now.  JT.  Justin Timberlake.  Of course.  He said that in there?  Justin Timberlake said, yeah, you're listening to Now.  It's me, Justin Timberlake.  But there was nothing to listen to before he said that.  Yeah.  How did they get that?  That's weird.  That's crazy.  It's now.  You don't think about the past.  It's so now that they were able to get them now. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  They were about to listen to Boom Boom Pow.  Now.  Now.  They've been listening to the stunting.  Oh, so they were commenting on the stunting.  Yes.  How did they get them all out so fast?  Live.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Amazing.  I don't know, man.  Their strategy is not smart.  No.  Because they're going to get people very used to hearing music without commercials, and  then they're going to throw all the commercials at you.  It's like somebody goes to you, hey, see that really hot chick? 
[00:40:30]  Just picture the hottest chick in your mind right now.  She's yours for a month.  And you don't even think about what happens after the month's over.  You're like, wow, this is now.  It's fantastic.  This rules.  And you're banging this hot chick for a month doing everything possible, right?  Oh, yeah.  And then the month's over, and all of a sudden they take the girl out.  You're like, hey, wait, wait.  I was getting used to this hot bra that you gave me.  What happened?  Like, don't worry.  We still got something for you.  Yeah.  And they walk in someone like Rosie O'Donnell. 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Right?  You can't, like, tease people with something really good and then take it away from them.  And then take it away, yeah.  I'll be the first to admit, like, listening to radio without commercials rules.  That's why I like the satellite radio.  That's why I haven't listened to regular radio in a long time.  A long time.  Because when you have the satellite, I mean, we're talking to the converted, obviously.  But, you know.  Yeah.  You get used to it.  And then they're going to throw all those commercials at you after a month? 
[00:41:30]  Well, they did 10,000 songs in a row.  Right.  They started repeating songs within the first hour.  I heard because they weren't completely prepared to launch this thing.  Really?  They said they had, like, 70 to 75 songs in the system.  70.  10,000 in a row.  Yes.  With 75 songs?  Wow.  That's a few repeats.  Yeah.  After, like, they kept going now, now, now.  And within the first 10 songs, they played Party Up by DMX.  And that song came out in 1999.  Oh, really?  That's 10 years ago. 
[00:42:00]  So that's not really now.  No.  Sam.  And they also played.  That's a bit ago instead of now.  They played Baby Got Back.  Yeah.  Within the first two hours of the station.  Well, we all know that one is not really now.  That's not now.  Do they call it a classic now?  They didn't have any production for it.  Best of the old and best of now.  What are they doing?  Oh, it's classic now.  They're already changing formats a little bit.  They're tweaking it.  We really need to tweak the format.  Yeah.  We're not even on yet.  We're still stunting. 
[00:42:30]  Tweak it.  Tweak it.  Well, you know.  Panicky Pete here.  Well, they've decided to take on Z100.  And they decided they need a pop radio war.  So.  Yeah.  This is a 923 Now versus Z100 promo?  Yeah.  Wow.  What does that mean?  Well, they're running these, like, between their 10,000 in a row,  songs.  Like, at least once every hour, they were doing a promo that was attacking  Z100 as if there's going to be.  Why are they reminding people that Z100 is around?  Yeah.  Why not just play your now music?  It's not like there's going to be new people. 
[00:43:00]  They're going to now say, you know what?  I'm going to start listening to Top 40 music.  Right.  All right.  Hi, I'm 923 Now FM.  And I have this station.  By the way, the Hi, I'm 923 Now FM is some intern.  Because they don't have any now jocks.  They have that one broad I hear.  They have some chick.  So that guy is just some dude.  Yeah.  Street team member.  All right.  You have to represent Now.  Yeah.  You're you against Z100.  Someone sent me a picture of some of the Now street team. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Handing out some swag at the Britney Spears show, I believe.  And the bumper stickers look exactly like the K-Rock stickers, except they're black and  blue instead of black and red.  Yes.  It's this powdery, fag blue.  Oh, God.  Hi, I'm 923 Now FM.  And I have this station your mom grew up on, Z100.  Whoa.  Yeah, I guess I'm pretty new at this radio thing. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, that's for sure, kid.  You see, I've been at this a long time.  Oh, really?  Is this the Mac thing, right?  Yeah, it's Mac versus PC parody.  Oh, that Mac versus PC parody.  Oh, now I get it.  Ooh, that's for sure, kid.  You see, I've been at this a long time.  Oh, really?  Heck yeah, since 1983.  That's when I grabbed the old eight-track player.  I'm sorry, the what?  And punched up our first song ever.  Woo! 
[00:44:30]  Wow, that's something.  What was your first song there, 923 Newbie FM?  Um, we just started with this about an hour ago.  I don't even know what that song is.  Really?  New York's 92.3 Now FM.  10,000 songs in a row.  The best, baby!  They're bragging that they played Black Eyed Peas, but no one knows that song yet, right?  Yeah, it's brand new.  See, it's now.  But, I mean, is it so brand new that no one really knows the song yet? 
[00:45:00]  It's not like a big popular song.  So they're bragging about something that no one really knows about yet.  Yeah.  Well, they're not going to sit there playing Eye of the Tiger like old man Z100 does.  But I don't think they would play that.  They've been around since 1983.  They're not now.  Isn't that kind of a compliment?  We have radio experience.  Yeah, that we've been around for so long and, you know, been able to weather the storms.  We should do a parody of that.  It's Opie and Anthony versus Dave and Bobo.  Yeah, Dave and Bobo. 
[00:45:30]  What do you got over there?  When now?  What do you think, Bobo?  Wow.  Whoa!  When now?  The next one is 923 Now isn't playing commercials.  That's right.  That's the promo they're running?  Yeah, they don't play commercials.  Because 10,000 in a row, baby.  Oh, my God.  You can't brag that you don't play commercials when you know you have to eventually.  Yeah.  It's the worst thing you can do.  When that sales team is gearing up already.  It's the worst thing you can do.  Right now. 
[00:46:00]  They're hitting the pavement.  That sales team is out there hitting the pavement as we speak.  You guys aren't thinking strategy.  It's short term.  Think short term.  Think short term.  Yes.  And then knee jerk at the end.  Yes.  All right.  That sounds reasonable.  We'll let C100 play all the commercials and make all the money while we stick to 10,000  songs in a row with zero minutes of commercials.  Hey, we might be broke in the end, but at least this shit is fun.  10,000 songs in a row.  This is the new 923. 
[00:46:30]  Now.  Now.  But then you're going to have to play commercials.  Yeah.  And that clock is ticking.  It's not 10,000 songs anymore.  Yeah, that's what the ticking clock was.  How long is their cash going to last?  They got a few hundred under their belt already.  What drove me crazy about that commercial was any time that we had a clip with a curse  in it and we brought it in to get beeped, we had to beep the entire word.  If there was a little piece of the letter at the beginning or the end, the whole thing  had to get beeped.  And they just kept in most of the curse.  They bleeped out the I.  Yeah.  Can we play that again? 
[00:47:00]  Because somebody thinks he needs to write to the FCC.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  We'll let C100 play all the commercials and make all the money.  While we stick to 10,000 songs in a row with zero minutes of commercials.  Hey, we might be broke in the end, but at least this shit is fun.  10,000 songs in a row.  You know what?  This is the new 92.3.  Now.  Very offensive.  I was so offended by hearing that.  That was shit. 
[00:47:30]  It was shit.  I heard shit.  Because I'm not paying for that.  That's coming into my house.  No, no.  My kids could hear that.  They're on their way to school at that hour.  Oh, I didn't even think about that.  I don't have any kids.  Fuck.  I forgot about that.  There are kids.  But there are.  Somebody with kids, send me a form letter.  I'll sign it.  Yeah.  I'll say I heard it.  That would be a shame if the new now had FCC complaints filed against it because I'm not  beeping shit properly.  Not beeping shit.  It was not beeped properly.  I would not recommend that because that would just be a big headache for those guys. 
[00:48:00]  That would really suck if they made the mistake of playing an unedited pop song, by the way.  They actually did beat the shit out of us about bleeping entire curses.  Yeah, always.  Like you couldn't even have a shh shh at the beginning of shit.  If we brought one in with that, if that was brought in, it would have gotten dumped out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  They ripped the dump system out of the building, I'm sure.  There's no need for it.  Yeah.  Not with that format.  And finally, 923 Now lists things that suck. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that's right.  O&A.  And now, another 923 Now FM list of things that suck.  Getting mugged.  Getting stabbed by some moron's broken umbrella.  And Z100.  Nod your head to this.  New York's 923 Now FM.  Wow, they're just rallying the Z100 troops.  I know.  They're just rallying the people that grew up and it's part of their life going. 
[00:49:00]  It just pisses them off.  They're creating a sense of loyalty to Z100.  Yeah.  Right.  They're basically telling everyone to get together because what you really like might be going away.  Right.  So now participate more.  Listen a little longer.  Do not listen to our station.  Support our advertisers.  Right.  Subliminally, that's what they're saying.  Yeah.  To everybody that enjoys that radio station.  I just hope that nobody was offended by that fucking shit going out. 
[00:49:30]  By that blatant, vulgar word.  Dude, because an FCC fine, and I would never want to see them get one.  No, no.  It's $365,000.  That's a lot of money.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of money, man.  You know, how are they going to do that without getting money for commercials?  Because Z100 is making all the money.  Let them make the money.  They're just having fun.  We're just going to have some...  You can't pay a fine with fun.  This shit beep is fun.  Yeah.  Yep.  All right. 
[00:50:00]  Keep up your good nature.  It's cool to see Russell Brand back on PX11.  It's nice.  What's this, two out of four days?  Oh, really?  You already did that interview, right?  Yeah.  Hey, let me go to Eddie in Rockland County.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm listening to you guys.  I love it.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Wait, you don't have satellite?  You're just listening on hold?  No, I'm listening on hold.  I have satellite for years.  I love you guys.  Being able to walk into my job is great listening to me the whole time.  Oh, all right. 
[00:50:30]  But I was going to talk about the 97 back in the late 80s.  They switched from one station to the other with some BS about a stronger signal.  Right.  And they played the pump up the volume on one station and then went to country and then  finished the song on the other station.  But after listening to all that, it was kind of pointless.  That's kind of clever, though.  So they were like just changed.  I don't even remember this.  They changed Hot 97 to a stronger signal?  They were off of an old.  They were on like a different station at one point. 
[00:51:00]  They went to Hot 97.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  So the old station started to pump up the volume and then they stopped it and said,  hey, if you want to hear the rest of this song, you got to go over to this new frequency  that no one knew of at the time, Hot 97.  And then they finished the song over there.  It's not bad.  That's pretty cool.  What was the original number of it?  I don't even know.  Do you know, sir?  It doesn't really matter.  No, I don't remember.  Just some station that had a weaker signal.  We were sitting there and having to switch the station fast because we all knew it was  going to happen.  All right.  Thank you, Eddie.  Z100's a bunch of c***** cunts. 
[00:51:30]  Miguel in Texas.  What's up, Miguel?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Glad y'all are back on Soleon XM.  Yep.  Yep.  But anyways, yeah, back in the mid-90s, we had a radio station switch to Kiss FM, so some  genius over there decided it would be a good idea to play from Friday night to Monday morning  that song Kiss by Prince.  Right. 
[00:52:00]  Ooh.  And the local people thought that I guess a DJ had died or something.  They started calling the police and they started showing up there trying to figure out what  the hell was going on while they were looping this song back to back to back from Saturday  to Monday morning.  People are stupid.  That's...  It's amazing, yeah.  And then, of course, the first song that they play, once they do, do the switch is, of course,  Prince, Kiss, just to top it all up, I guess.  Yuck.  I hate that everything in radio that is supposed to be spontaneous is, like, very well planned 
[00:52:30]  out.  But they want you to think it's spontaneous.  Like, being spontaneous would be, you throw in...  Know what I would have done?  It's very simple.  You get Tippy Tom.  Oh, God, yeah.  K-Rock's ending.  And you just put him in the studio for a day with live microphones.  And don't even tell him he has to talk in them.  So now you're tuning in the station you really love and all of a sudden you hear a homeless  guy just...  I'm hungry. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, give him a bunch of...  Why don't you guys love me?  Give him a bunch of DVDs he could throw into some player.  And then you hear him commenting about the dumb movies.  If you want my body, I just think I'm sick.  That should just be a radio station.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, give him enough beer.  Give him the security code so he can let all his friends up.  That's how I would do it.  WBUM.  Right.  In the 80s, he was shitting his pants.  In the 90s, he threw up on himself. 
[00:53:30]  And now he's doing both.  I kind of like that idea for this channel.  We should have a homeless weekend and just have Tippy Tom for the whole weekend.  Enjoy.  We leave after Ron and Fez.  There you go, Tippy.  It's your joint.  Literally the Saturday night virus.  Yeah, right?  And there's one bit of great news for us.  I don't know if we're going to go into this, but the fact that you're going to be able  to get SiriusXM on fucking iPods and iPhones.  Yeah, that's big news.  Phenomenal, man.  All these people that don't have new cars or the equipment can listen to us at work. 
[00:54:00]  It's fucking great, man.  And the stock popped up yesterday because of that.  Yeah, it's huge.  A little bit, a little bit.  I got it on my home Sonos system, too.  Keith called up, got to, because, you know, it's a pain in the ass for me to call up, because  I got to talk to executives over there, and I don't want to do that.  So I called up, and they hooked it up, and now on my Sonos system, I could hit it and  play any SiriusXM channel all over my house.  Yeah, it's huge.  A little thing comes up with the virus on it when it's this channel and everything.  So, yeah, I finally did that, and then the iPhone thing would be huge. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  When does that happen, you know?  Spring, they said.  Spring of 2020.  Now.  They make that in very small font, though.  Yes, yes, very small.  They said spring, which is, aren't we kind of in the beginning stages of spring?  Yeah, what's that, like May or June or something, April?  Ah, sooner than that, I would imagine.  Baby.  I think spring starts in a couple weeks.  Right?  At the end of the month?  Spring is now.  It's now, man.  A couple more of these format changes before we go to break.  It's Ron in Illinois. 
[00:55:00]  Ron.  Yeah, back in the late 80s, early 90s, KZ93 in Peoria, Illinois.  Yeah.  They changed their format, didn't tell anybody, and for 36 hours played the song Changes by David  Bowie.  Oh, and you, the listener, you have to sit there at home and go, Changes?  I like this song.  Oh, my God.  Then they play it again, you're like, Changes?  I like, wait a minute!  That's the first time you're kind of hooked.  Right.  And then, yeah, you're thinking the DJ died or something.  Oof.  Yeah, but you're like, wait a minute, Changes.  I know what they're up to.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Figure it out.  Yep.  I just got so distracted by Camel Toe. 
[00:55:30]  Is that Camel Toe?  Camel Toe.  Wow!  A lot of Camel Toe.  Oh, yeah.  Picks is showing fucking puffy vagina Camel Toe.  Through these spandex outfits.  It starts in her fucking crotch and ends in her mid-stomach.  Wow.  What a puss.  That one all the way on the end has a fucking really puffy vag.  She's got Catcher's Mitt in the front of her pants.  I don't know what that was all about.  They look like some kind of, you know, dance troupe.  Yeah, yeah.  God, what's better than tight spandex and a fat puss?  Oh!  That equals fun. 
[00:56:00]  That's now.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  This is a good one, too.  Chris in Cleveland.  Chris.  Morning.  Hey.  Good morning.  One of our stations here was an alt-rock station.  When they flipped to the alt-rock format, the station was called The End 107.9.  So they played R.E.M.'s song, It's the End of the World, as we know, for 24 hours when  they started.  And then when they got to Urban, they started playing the song, Get Up, for 24 hours.  And wait, when was the song they played for 24 hours after that?  Um, R.E.M., It's the End of the World, as we know. 
[00:56:30]  We know that one.  And now we talked over where I needed to hear.  What was the one they started with for hip-hop, sorry?  Ah, fuck me.  No!  No!  You couldn't have a worse call than that guy.  But dude, that's the point.  I swear to God, I need to know the second song now.  That's our fault, though, because we've trained them that any time we ask a question, we're  lying.  We're lying.  Here we go.  We know.  Oh, he said the second song while we were still talking.  I know.  What was the hip-hop song? 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  We'll never know.  Oh, my God.  Wait, we have it on tape, though.  Let's go back and replay it.  Oh, my God.  We can't hear it.  Let's say hi to Brian in South Carolina.  Brian.  Hey there.  Hey.  Station I was working for in Greenville, South Carolina.  We switched from oldies to top 40, and they had us reading the phone book for three  days.  You had to actually go on the air and just read the phone book?  Oh, God.  100,000 watts.  This station is for all people.  People like.  We read all the names in the phone book. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  I hope all those people sued.  Oh, it was great.  Yeah.  It was before we started making up Peter Gazinia names.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to.  Phil McCracken.  I'm going to rate these format flip changes.  That one's.  That's better than most.  Yeah, that is a great one.  That's better than doing changes for 24 hours.  Yeah.  It was stupid.  People were calling and thinking we were reading obituaries.  Everyone died or something.  Well, that would have been even better.  That, too.  That would have been even better.  People that will not be listening to our new station. 
[00:58:00]  People that are dead now.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dennis on Long Island.  Dennis.  Yeah, the station he was talking about, it was Hot 103.  It went down to 97 and then 97, which was country, because Hot 103 bought the more powerful  format.  Okay.  The more powerful signal.  That's what it was.  Oh, there you go.  And it moved over to Hot 97.  Thank you, sir.  Which is still there.  Yes, it is.  Hot 97.  You sound like Richard Huff, by the way.  Thank you.  I know that was extremely obscure, but I just had to say that. 
[00:58:30]  Thanks, Dennis.  Daniel in Memphis, what's up?  Hi.  I used to be a DJ, producer, slash bitch guy for this radio station, Adult Contemporary.  Right.  And one day, we got, I think, Clear Channel.  Someone took over.  I don't remember who.  It was some big company.  And we changed from that to country, because Tennessee doesn't have enough country stations.  So we did the stereotypical, played the construction sound effects for an entire day.  And then the next day, played some song for three days straight. 
[00:59:00]  Instead of getting new listeners, we gained death threats.  Really?  Death threats.  People, old women calling me, threatening to kill me.  I was on air that day.  I was so embarrassed, I quit two weeks later.  What was the name of the song?  Some song about construction.  I didn't even know a thing about country.  And they had me doing DJ work and all that for country music.  Yeah.  I was talking to this girl, singer Taylor Swift.  I knew nothing about her. 
[00:59:30]  Now she's huge.  Yeah.  She's going to be on Now.  Oh, is she?  Yeah.  She's a pop artist.  She's a Now artist?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Sam knows everything.  Sam knows everything about Now.  He sure does.  Sam is Now.  He sure is.  You are Now.  I'm going to a Britney Spears concert tonight.  I hope you have done a lot of story about the whole thing on that change.  Where?  In Newark.  It's the Prudential Center.  Homo.  Oh.  Pussycat Dolls opening.  Homo.  Oh.  I don't know about that.  You know what's going to be in that freaking movie?  Yeah.  A lot of young puss.  Yeah.  And me.  No. 
[01:00:00]  I think Madonna brings in the homo.  I think someone like Britney Spears brings in the teenagers.  Yeah.  In the early 20s.  She still got it.  You know who brings in the gay is, oh my God, Simph and fucking, oh my God, the Supremes.  Diana Ross.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They love Diana Ross.  Anything that guys dress up as, like cross-dressers dress as.  Liza.  Things like that.  All bringing the gay.  They love it.  You've never seen happier gay people. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, all the luscious cock.  Yeah.  Dancing and bouncing, getting sweaty.  Cock rings all over the damn place.  You know everyone probably had a cock ring on under their trousers.  Under their slacks.  Slacks.  The pee flying everywhere in the bathroom.  They got their split penises.  Oh, God.  That's what gay guys do.  They split their penis head.  That's right.  Oh, oh.  Every single guy does that.  Like, they split their penis head. 
[01:01:00]  In those pictures, it's just painful.  Who wants to see that?  Actually, it looks like a hot dog to get a child.  Right.  Yeah.  Let's go to John in Nebraska.  John?  Yeah.  In the early days, it was like, I think it was 69 or 70, KFMQ and Lincoln flipped from  classical to AOR.  And it was supposed to have killed an old lady when they did the flip.  It was like 6 o'clock on a Friday night.  And her husband said that they were listening to the radio. 
[01:01:30]  And all of a sudden, it was 25 or 6 to 4 by Chicago.  And he came into the room, and she was on the floor dead.  Oh, that's what they said?  It was a famous legend in Lincoln for years that KFMQ killed an old lady.  I always just thought it was hilarious.  Oh, that's pretty funny, actually.  You're kidding.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jeff in Buffalo.  Jeff?  Hey, this one time, a station in Buffalo there, they changed their format, and they 
[01:02:00]  did an entire week of a countdown.  It's Bobo?  Something like, yeah, like 2,157 minutes, 26 seconds.  And it was just a continuation.  All right, punch it out, boys.  All right.  Yeah, that's not too good.  Continuation.  Two words.  We'll do one more, then we'll hit the break here.  Mark in Linden.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:02:30]  There's a station in Philly, 96.5.  They used to play adult contemporary.  Well, their last day on the air, they had their morning show go on, and within the first  10 minutes, they made it as the janitor tied the morning show host up in the broom closet,  and the janitor took over and started playing rap music.  No, they didn't.  The janitor, huh?  I'm dead serious.  Oh, yeah.  That's insane.  I'm dead serious.  Was the janitor a black dude?  I pray they went all in, and the janitor was a black dude. 
[01:03:00]  No, well, actually, the janitor was Rocco the janitor.  Oh, really?  Dude.  Yeah, the rocker decided he needed hip-hop all of a sudden.  Yeah.  I can't believe he went along with it, because he was a legend in Philly.  Paul Barsky was the morning show host at the time.  Oh, Paul.  Wait, was Rocco the janitor or Rocker?  Rocker.  Rocco.  Oh, Rocco.  Rocco.  Yeah, tied the guy up, dude.  Yeah.  Why would a rock guy want to all of a sudden hear hip-hop? 
[01:03:30]  Rocco loves hip-hop.  But he's Rocco.  His name says what he likes.  Rocco.  Yeah, well, that station now was Wild 96.5.  Then they winded up getting sued by another station for using the word wild, because a station  in Philadelphia had their wild 99.  Right.  So they had to change their name like two months later over to Wired 96.5.  And that's where, what's his name is on that?  Chio character, the one that was dissing the cop in Philly.  Yeah, that loser. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  There you go.  There's a fine picture for everybody as we're going to break.  Ow!  How much do you hate yourself that you have to do that to your penis?  It's a cock that's been cut down the middle.  It looks like a deformed lobster claw.  It does.  Why would you do that to your dick?  Do you think that would hurt?  Because you're slicing through the hole.  No, not at all.  He sliced from the hole.  Not very sensitive.  Past the mushroom head.  I can't.  I can't.  He decided to go past the mushroom head with his cut. 
[01:04:30]  Do they tattoo the inside?  They'll split the cock, right?  A lot of times they split the cock and they'll tattoo the insides and pierce.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Why?  I'm hurting myself.  I'm hurting.  Just thinking about it.  Imagine you cocked and sliced like that open and peeled open.  No.  My eyes are tearing.  Anthony's right eye looks like he's looking through a telescope.  I know.  I can't deal with that.  Get a picture of body modification, Danny.  Sure.  With the...  Sure. 
[01:05:00]  Look at that one.  What are you doing?  Those are little needles through the cock head all the way around the rim of his mushroom  head.  And he has a Prince Albert through?  It's sewing needles or something.  Prince Albert really have one of those?  I don't know.  No.  What an awful thing to be named after.  I know.  It's like, gee, thanks.  Oh, God damn it.  I can't look at this shit.  What?  What's wrong?  It's fucking disturbing and it looks so painful.  Oh, you're being such a curmudgeon.  This is now.  This is now?  This is now. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, fuck.  How do you get a hard on?  I don't...  I am...  Wow.  That guy split right down to the pubis.  That guy went all in.  He split it all the way down.  How do you cum?  That guy has two penises.  I don't get it.  There's no way that...  You've cum out of the middle.  What do the guys do out there to search this crap, Danny?  Well, if you'd like to see bisected penis...  Google, ouch.  Just like we all do.  You can Google image search for B-M-E penis. 
[01:06:00]  Body modification something.  Right.  Body modification.  Penis.  Penis.  By the way, there was one guy...  I saw a guy who had done this in an interview, and it was like a whole thing on body modification,  and he had...  Because his dick was so fucked up, he had to piss out of a hole by his asshole.  Like, that's where his stream got diverted to, and he had a flame tattoo around it, and  he was a gay guy, and he goes...  And then I pissed to...  Ooh, sounds to me like someone's getting a jingle. 
[01:06:30]  And he said, it's tough.  I have to put out the flames.  And that was how he pissed.  Oh, so he put it out with his piss.  It was fucking horrendous.  I hope that guy fell into a ditch.  I'm sure he's probably not around anymore.  Oh, I don't know about that.  I know what you mean.  Yeah, of course.  You never know.  Possibly.  Why don't we take a quick break here.  What the fuck?  The flame. 
[01:07:00]  It's tough to say it doesn't hurt.  It's all soft tissue.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  Stop it.  Good for you.  You know how many nerves are down there to make it feel good?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Those same nerves are going to make you go,  Ow!  Right.  Snack a ticker tackling.  Yes.  Exactly.  So, I'll tell you briefly.  Have a great day.  I've remained a앤or in this morning.  We are on winter.  Freddy, we are cool.  Hey, dude.  Thank you so much.  I'll see you next time.  Goodbye, man.  torrent memory.  We are on August 12th and make our pays feeling loads.  Well, thanks so much for being 
[01:07:30]  all the and so I've joined.  Because we don't miss anything. </pre>
