<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Matt LeBlanc (promoting *Episodes*) and Patton Oswalt as in-studio guests.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, began with a discussion about *Friends*, focusing on Lisa Kudrow's comedic talent and making crude jokes about Jennifer Aniston's alleged body odor. Opie recounted a negative experience watching *Friends* with his ex-wife and her mother, expressing his resentment at being forced to watch after work.  They reminisced about their early radio days in Boston, referencing Opie's nickname "Slappy" and Anthony's heavier workload.  A tangent about hard drive sizes followed, prompted by a memory of comedian Joe Mulligan. Opie connected his dislike of *Friends* to his past marital problems.

The conversation abruptly shifted to John Boehner, mocking his crying, which led to a discussion about men crying, filled with offensive language and personal anecdotes.  They contrasted the public's reaction to Alan Alda's unassuming presence versus the attention given to reality TV stars, commenting on the financial success (or lack thereof) of actors from *Friends* and *MASH*.

A substantial portion focused on true crime television, specifically shows about international drug smuggling and murder.  Opie and Anthony detailed their viewing habits, expressing fascination with criminal psychology and discussing cases from shows like *Locked Up Abroad* and *Deadly Women*, using graphic and offensive language. They described a case involving an Australian heroin smuggler with HIV, comparing justice systems. The *Ganja Queen* documentary was also mentioned.  The segment ended with a discussion about customs anxieties and the Ted Williams viral video.

The show then extensively covered Ted Williamsâ€™ rapid rise to fame.  Initially praising his voice, the hosts quickly transitioned to his extensive criminal record (theft, robbery, escape, forgery, drug possession), showing mugshots.  His recent behavior, including indecent exposure at a National Tire and Battery store (with the manager repeatedly called an "asshole"), was detailed. Audio clips of Williams on other shows were played, showcasing his voice and discussing offers ranging from an MTV appearance to a Cleveland Cavaliers opportunity with a potential housing offer from Quicken Loans.  The authenticity of these offers was debated.

Callers shared information about Williams, including details of his struggles with alcoholism and prior voiceover work.  A purported Ted Williams called in, making bizarre statements, followed by a call from someone claiming to be his manager.  Opie and Anthony discussed their radio experiences and industry practices.  A significant portion detailed Opie's diet and recent lapses (a chicken sandwich), focusing on the influence of his friend Roland and comedic discussions about condiments and diets. This segment concluded with Matt LeBlanc's arrival.

With LeBlanc, the conversation centered on *Episodes*, its satirical portrayal of the American network television system, and his role as a fictionalized version of himself.  They discussed the creative process, typecasting after *Friends*, and the differences between the British and American versions of *Episodes*.  LeBlanc shared anecdotes about *Friends* and *Joey*, offering candid opinions on the latter.  The discussion included the show's humor, politically incorrect nature (a scene at a rape victim benefit was mentioned as both uncomfortable and funny), and the portrayal of network executives.  LeBlanc discussed his personal life, career, and the persistent *Friends* reunion rumors, expressing his dislike of being labeled "likable."

Patton Oswalt then joined. The conversation shifted to the contrast between outwardly stable individuals and troubled childhoods. Oswalt shared anecdotes, using highly offensive language to describe women he'd known.  He discussed being mistaken for other comedians, his early career struggles (low pay, grueling schedules, exploitative agents), and his financial difficulties even while on television.  He recounted meeting Mike Starr.  Oswalt also discussed the evolution of his comedic style, moving from angry to self-deprecating, and the challenges of maintaining a "cool" persona.  He promoted his book, *Zombie Spaceship Wasteland*, and his involvement in a Maynard James Keenan documentary. The show ended with further ribald remarks and repeated instances of "We'll be back."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy, the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  These guys are trying to find!  Oh my God!  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape.  Yes.  It's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Matt LeBlanc will be in studio today.  Yeah.  Felt like starting that way.  Yeah.  He's got a brand new show on Showtime and we all saw it and I think we all like it, right?  Yeah, we do.  Episodes.  It's called Episodes.  Episodes.  I saw the entire first season.  Yep, seven episodes.  So, conceptually it's very original.  There's a... 
[00:01:00]  Well, let him explain.  I don't know how much he wants to give away by it, but it's very funny and it's well written  and well acted.  I could tell you how the season ends.  No, that's probably not good.  That's not good.  No.  We also saw Patton Oswalt today.  I hope we've never had on.  He was really funny.  Finally.  Yeah.  I'm happy he's coming in today.  You know, he did a movie that no one saw called, I think, The Fan.  Yeah, he was good.  I loved it.  Yeah, he was really good.  It was a little independent film about being an obsessed...  Was he a Giants fan?  Giants fan.  Giants, right?  Yeah.  Obsessed Giants fan.  Yeah.  And the movie was really good, but no one really saw it. 
[00:01:30]  Rehearsing his calls before he would call and writing down his points.  Yeah, he was a psycho sports talk show caller, right?  I bet you a lot of those guys really do that, too.  I was watching it, and that's probably how they make their points so succinctly, because  they probably write down stuff.  Yeah, write it down.  I would.  Yeah.  That's the type of movie that if someone grabbed it and just pumped it up a little bit, I think  it would be a huge movie.  Wow, he was a creep in that movie.  He sure was.  What a creep.  And we tried to get him in for that, but he, I don't know.  He might not have been in town.  Yeah.  And you bring that up, but also Matt LeBlanc. 
[00:02:00]  Big fan it was called.  There was a little show called Friends.  Oh, yeah.  A little trivia.  Yeah, that's true.  A little obscure trivia there.  You know, he's in episodes on Showtime, but there was this show called Friends.  I didn't see Friends.  What years was that on?  I don't think I ever saw a complete episode of Friends.  Friends started sort of when Seinfeld ended.  There might have been a little bit of a lap over, right?  Oh, there was some kind of overlap.  Well, not for too long, though. 
[00:02:30]  When did Seinfeld end?  He did 10 years on Friends.  Seinfeld ended in, like, 98.  Oh, okay.  It was four years.  So you got about a four-year.  Oh, okay.  It's one of the biggest shows ever.  It's like, because of Seinfeld and MASH and All in the Family and the other names, you forget.  But Friends is literally one of the biggest sitcoms of all time.  I'll admit this, though.  I'm starting to watch Friends now, and there's only one reason.  You want to try to figure it out?  You should figure it out, Jimmy.  I'm going to guess Lisa Kudrow.  Exactly. 
[00:03:00]  Because of the comeback, I went, fuck this Lisa Kudrow.  I didn't realize how funny this broad is.  And then you go and watch the old episodes of Friends and realize, holy shit, she was hilarious on that show.  Hilarious.  But I think she got buried because the cast was so big.  He didn't realize how funny she was.  LeBlanc, Aniston, Schwimmer, and her.  Was that the whole cast?  And Perry.  Oh, right, right.  Matthew Perry, right?  Yeah.  Courtney Cox, who's in Cougar Town.  Oh, right. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, there's a lot of them.  Okay.  And Jennifer Aniston, who never aged.  Jennifer Aniston is a fucking piece of ass.  Too bad her pussy smells, supposedly.  Oh, jeez.  Well, you might want to ask that.  I said supposedly.  Yeah, I want to ask that badly.  You probably want her to comment on that.  I don't think you would.  Why doesn't she have a man, then?  She wants to have a man, and she wants to have kids, and she can't figure it out.  Comment on that.  And Brad Pitt ran for the hills.  Matt LeBlanc is depressingly handsome.  Really?  Depressingly, yeah, like. 
[00:04:00]  Do you like the gray-haired version?  He was dyeing his hair during Friends.  Oh, was he?  Yes, he went prematurely gray.  Seriously.  He looks young.  How do you know that shit?  Huh?  How do you know that?  Yeah, what did you see inside the actor's studio?  Yeah, I watch shows.  Well, seeing him on episodes, which is on Showtime, which he'll be promoting today, I was thinking  to myself, wow, he must have been kind of the older guy during the Friends years.  Yeah.  He's not an old-looking guy.  He's definitely a middle-aged man.  I have such a bad thing with Friends, though, because it was one of the shows that was VCR'd. 
[00:04:30]  It was a scheduled show.  That you had a watch?  I had a watch with the ex-wife and her mother.  And while I sat there, just wanting to be home.  God, I can't believe you're the same guy.  I had to sit there.  Me neither.  Fuck.  I know we all changed, but fuck.  Oh, God.  That change you went through is one for the ages, man.  That was a little too crazy.  You just sat there on an old, smelly couch. 
[00:05:00]  Old, smelly, doggy couch.  Watching horrible shows with your wife and mother-in-law.  Watching Days of Our Lives, General Hospital.  There was a lineup.  Yes.  And then Friends.  And this was after you were done with the radio show.  And you weren't allowed to go home until all the shows were over.  Yeah.  I remember this.  You know, we'd get done at 7 o'clock, 3 to 7.  But then at 7 o'clock, we always had production to do.  We had to do our own, like, we had to do commercials for the radio station.  You had to do more than me.  Ourselves. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I was actually, again.  You were a rookie back then.  You didn't know how to handle that yet.  I didn't mind it, though.  I was still in happy-to-be-there mode.  And I was learning a lot about, like, recording.  And can you tell that story again?  Well, when we were in Boston, they had, like, these little mailboxes for me and Ann and the  rest of the jocks.  And because I was in radio longer at the time, when we first got to Boston, my pile was pretty  high.  And Anthony's was just a nice average pile. 
[00:06:00]  Little tags.  Little tags, which is...  Tonight on Fox 25.  You know how the homeless Golden Voice guy did on his video?  That's what Ann was doing.  I'd tag the end of pre-recorded shit.  Right.  You know, the local Fox affiliate or something.  Because I was around a little longer.  I had these produced spots where I had to get music and 60 seconds out of talk and maybe  get a sound effect.  And I got the name Slappy because I refused to do more than one take.  Yes, yes. 
[00:06:30]  They called him Slappy because he would slap together the commercials and there'd be these  glaring errors in it.  So between Ann being happy to be there and me being around a little too long at that point,  the piles, as the months went by, drastically changed.  And I would have maybe one piece of production in my mailbox.  And Anthony's, I'm not even exaggerating because Ann's got a good voice and all.  His pile was almost hitting the ceiling. 
[00:07:00]  It was crazy.  And I was working the machines like a monkey.  Right.  I'm trying to track things.  Like, usually you'd just voice over something.  Sure.  I'm like tracking and putting effects on voices to make it sound like characters.  Because they pretty much, I could do whatever I want with these spots.  Right.  I would just pick a song I liked.  There'd be vocals.  Oh, vocals.  I'm talking over the vocals.  Yeah.  That's not what you do in commercials.  Grab a hook of a song and like start talking over it. 
[00:07:30]  But then the vocals would kick in.  And you're supposed to like re-loop the hook.  Sure.  And synchronize it so you can't tell.  You can't even tell.  Like we do with our rejoiners.  Yeah.  And in Pro Tools, it's easy now.  The electronic version.  But when we first started over there, it was still tape.  Right.  So we're cutting tape and doing all kinds of shit like that.  And you would just let the vocals kick in and still talk right over the person singing.  So the sales department, you know, they all have clients.  They're like, well, fuck, I don't want him doing my production. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  So it got to a point the show would be over at 7.  I'm like, all right, I have no production tonight.  And it's like, well, I'll be here for at least another two hours.  Yeah, it was like two hours.  Call me later.  And I'm out the door at 7.02.  And it's stuck there until 9.30.  I'm still like fucking just, oh, I got to do this and that one.  That changed when we moved to New York.  You finally taken it all out.  But that was it.  I was done.  But I did want to press those sales assholes.  I wanted to learn how the recording equipment worked. 
[00:08:30]  That made sense to us.  Because they were like, hey, look at what we got.  It's this thing that's called Pro Tools.  Oh, shit.  We were like, oh.  And he goes, yeah, you know what?  This hard drive in this thing is one gigabyte.  I was like, a one gig hard drive?  That's a lot, right?  That's insanity.  Wow.  Wow.  But you know, a gigabyte, the first time I heard that was from a comedian named Joe.  And we were at Dangerfields. 
[00:09:00]  And he said, I have a computer that I've, he used to add hard, like hard drive space so  you could add it.  Sure.  And build the stuff.  And it was a fucking gigabyte.  We thought that was all the memory.  Like, you'll never use that.  Yeah, you'll never even use that up.  What's a gigabyte these days?  Joe Mulligan, by the way.  What is a gigabyte these days?  It's one video file.  Half a cock photo?  Yeah.  Half a cock photo.  A terabyte's the big one.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, you know, now you get a terabyte.  No, really?  What is a gigabyte?  It's more than a video, isn't it?  A thousand.  Yeah, well, it depends on how much it's compressed.  You could, uh, a lot of, a lot of your basic video, if you take video, uh, yeah, depending 
[00:09:30]  on how long it is, but a gigabyte is nothing.  It will, it will eat up video, especially HD video will eat up a gig in no time.  No problem whatsoever.  How fast?  How fast?  What is it?  A couple minutes.  A minute of HD?  Probably somewhere around there.  It's crazy.  Why are we talking about this?  I forgot nine, uh, gigs an hour of, uh, HD video. 
[00:10:00]  Uh, we were talking about me and then having to, and then you would have to leave the radio  station at eight 30 or whatever, after all this production, then you would have to go  pick up the ex at the mother-in-law's house where I was living.  And then I would see you again.  I'm like, Hey, I've already watched, I've already watched two hours of TV.  Yeah.  Great.  And then you would have to go downstairs in that smelly fucking basement.  Doggy fucking, uh, mildewy wet basement.  And watch programs and watch the programs with my mother-in-law and my wife. 
[00:10:30]  And we would watch, like I said, uh, uh, days of our lives is, uh, uh, recorded.  And then a general hospital was a, and this little VCR shit, you know, real quality stuff  on tapes that would be re-recorded over and over and over again.  And so like the tracking was off and so you can't even watch it.  And then, and then friends.  And before I knew it, it's like, it was three more hours.  So now it's, you know, 11 o'clock and you know, they're, you know, putting down a little 
[00:11:00]  of the sauce as they say.  I'm dealing with that.  I don't think you were drinking as much back then, were you?  Or she, uh, please, I, I would, no, I would mix up some captains and cokes.  She always out drank you though.  I thought, Oh, please.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The captains and cokes though.  Uh, I had, I had to keep going upstairs and grabbing those, kick the dog, make a drink,  just go back downstairs.  Where do you think I fucking killed the dog?  It seems like you had a few kicks in that. 
[00:11:30]  Nah, I used to like kick it in the face.  You went right for the vital organ.  Well, maybe the liver, maybe one time the liver.  It had a few good years after that.  It's been many years and she's, she's dead now.  So it doesn't matter.  I love, I love animals.  Of course you do.  Yeah.  But sometimes they piss you off.  Yeah, they do.  When they finally take your prime rib.  Yeah.  When the Knicks are in the playoffs.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  When was the last time the Knicks were in the playoffs?  I think you people understand, right?  Sometimes you got to fucking Michael Vick, that fucking thing. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  All right.  Don't give me that reputation.  Jesus.  My reputation's bad enough.  Yeah.  Oh, so it's all about friends.  So, so you have a love, hate with friends because of all this.  Yeah, because it always reminds me of those, those moments.  So whenever it comes on, I hear that opening song there.  And I just, did you think friends was funny?  There are a few episodes that are funny.  What's the leads?  What's the song?  I actually asked my girl.  I'll be there for you. 
[00:12:30]  I'll be there for you.  I'll be there for you. 
[00:13:00]  To the next, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  You look like a...  Toodly, toodly, doo.  Toodly, toodly, doo.  You're spoiling my listening experience.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Is this an original song for the show?  Or is this...  Nah, I think it was the Rembrandts.  Yeah, but I think they wrote it for the show.  They wrote it for the show.  Did they?  I think it was the Refreshments, I think. 
[00:13:30]  No, I think it was the Rembrandts.  I think that's right, the Rembrandts.  I got a funny line when he comes in, though.  I'm going to get a big laugh.  Oh, yeah?  I'm going to go, hey, we like your new friends.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah, Chip, you please.  We'll never get another A-lister, Chip.  That's a good one.  We're finally getting A-listers on this show.  Nah, but the Friends show, he'll get it.  He'll crack up.  That's David Crane.  I think...  To answer my question, I think Friends was a funny show.  But I think what happened, then every show did the same fucking formula as Seinfeld and, like, Friends. 
[00:14:00]  Well, that was kind of the...  And just made the sitcom really tired.  That was the 90s formula.  Every decade has its sitcom formula thing.  And the 90s formula was definitely the Friends Seinfeld kind of, you know, thingy.  You know, speaking of sitcoms, I'm on Columbus Avenue over the weekend with family.  And Alan Alda just walks by, and no one knew it was Alan Alda. 
[00:14:30]  Really?  And even the people I was with, because they're younger.  And I'm like, he was the biggest fucking TV star.  Who was he with?  Nobody.  Just walking alone.  And not one person noticed it was Alan Alda.  I'm like, that guy...  What was it, the 70s, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  Early 80s.  That guy wouldn't have been able to walk the street a couple decades ago.  And not one person recognized him.  I would have had to say hi to him.  I was out of my mind.  I'm like, that's fucking Alan Alda.  Do you guys understand?  He was as big as they come.  I love Alan Alda. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, he's local, man.  I see him a lot.  I have our photo together that he signed on my...  When you walk into my...  It's one of the things you see as soon as you walk into my house.  Really?  Yeah.  He doesn't sign a lot of autographs.  But he actually...  Louie got on the sign because they did a film together.  Oh.  And we talked for a while.  I told you I douched him out at one point.  Like, I think I was doing really good.  And then he just knew I was too much of a fan.  Oh, you blew it.  You passed that point of fanboy.  Yeah.  But then he signed it.  He's like, Jim, I'm your biggest fan.  Alan Alda.  It's a great signature.  Yeah, it was really nice.  He had no idea who I was.  He was really good in The Aviator. 
[00:15:30]  I didn't see that.  I want to see that just for him, though.  He was in The Aviator.  Yeah.  He played a fucking scumbag.  It was great.  Yeah.  He was really a prick.  Good one.  Right on.  Yeah, but he was like the fucking definitive star of the 70s.  And now he's just walking around and no one notices him.  He looks relatively the same.  I mean, he's obviously white.  He's gray, older, but yeah.  And older, but.  He gets the same recognition that BJ Honeycutt gets.  Well, but if a.  Mike Farrell. 
[00:16:00]  But if a Jersey Shore douchebag walked by, everyone would lose their minds.  It's like.  They would.  They would.  But Alan Alda, who is legendary, they don't even notice.  Alan Alda.  The syndication money.  I'm sure they had syndication deals.  You'd hope so.  He must be pulling it off MASH.  If they had any kind of good.  Well, of course.  Well, maybe not, though.  It seemed like those deals came into place a little later on.  You think.  Some of those guys, like the Brady Bunch kids got fucked over.  Oh, gots.  They should be hundred millionaires. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Hundreds of millions of heirs.  But by the time they.  How do you say that?  A hundred.  A hundred millionaires.  A hundred millionaires?  That doesn't sound right either.  By the time they did the final season of MASH, they were 11 years in.  They had to know.  That they got.  Maybe they got something for the last year.  And they would have signed some of the shit.  You think LeBlanc's got some of that.  Fucking guy doesn't have to work another day in his life.  Who are you kidding?  There's a good line in the show that he did where someone's criticizing.  So catchphrases are kind of cheesy.  He's like, yeah, talk to my house in Malibu.  Which is. 
[00:17:00]  Very good point.  What was his catchphrase?  How you doing?  I don't know.  I think it was how you doing.  I think he was how you doing.  Yeah.  But wasn't that the Budweiser guys?  No.  Didn't we hear that somewhere else too?  What's up?  Oh, no.  It was the fucking Yankee song.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Right.  I fucked that one up.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Awful.  All right.  Well.  So Matt LeBlanc coming in at 830 and Patton Oswalt. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  What is he promoting?  Caroline's?  Caroline's.  I don't know when he's there.  I'm guessing this weekend.  And he has a book called Zombie Spaceship Wasteland.  It's a book by Patton Oswalt.  And what is it?  I don't know.  I haven't even looked at it.  We just got it this morning.  Is it a novel, a novella, or some type of...  I'm going to guess it's silly.  I don't see many pictures.  Like a lot of these guys write these books and there's a lot of pictures.  I like pictures.  I do too.  You need a few pictures.  Yeah.  When there's pitches.  I like when the whole middle section is nothing but pictures. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then you jump ahead.  You go from like page 108 to 142.  You go right to the glossy pictures.  What a nice jump in a book.  I wanted to...  I hope I told you about it.  I just wanted to recommend...  When Penn Jillette came in, he talked about Teller's Play.  Yeah, in the village, right?  Play Dead, it's called.  It's right next door to the Comedy Cellar.  McDougal Street.  It's the Players Theater, I think it is.  115 McDougal Street. 
[00:18:30]  It was like a one-man show on death.  It's not Teller, it's this guy, Todd something, who's like an old carny.  It's fucking great, man.  Really good.  Really?  Yeah, it gets pitch black in the theater and it's funny.  It's a comedy.  It's not a...  I don't believe you.  I would never lie.  Well, you went to dinner with Penn and Teller, so I don't know.  No, I didn't.  Only with Penn Jillette.  And this wasn't brought up at all.  Teller happened to call me after.  So you just like it.  I did.  If I didn't like it, I wouldn't trash it.  I'm very suspicious.  But I wouldn't bring it up gratuitously.  You would just let it lay there.  You would just let it lay there. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It's like, you know, I wouldn't bash it because I do like those guys, but I wouldn't actually  just mention it out of the blue.  Yeah.  And recommend it.  Yeah, I hear you.  And stink my reputation on it.  No, I want to check that out.  But I thought it was going to be a small crowd.  It was very crowded.  But I recommend it highly.  Who's high name is that?  I don't know.  That's just some somebody's heinies.  Walking past Marlon Wayans.  Good old Marlon Wayans.  In Uruguay.  Uruguay.  Uruguay.  Hey, I want to congratulate John Boner there.  He's now the Speaker of the House, right? 
[00:19:30]  Big Boehner.  Boehner, yeah.  Boehner.  This guy's got to stop fucking crying, though.  It's really uncomfortable.  He's a grown man.  I know you're a big fan because you weren't a fan of Pelosi, but I can't take him crying  anymore.  Yeah, the crying thing is ridiculous.  You get uncomfortable at home.  Oh, I don't know.  Because he looks like a man's man.  Like, he looks like a guy that shouldn't be crying, and he cries a lot.  What's that about?  What happened to him as a child?  Just a young man with a gavel. 
[00:20:00]  We're all young men with dreams, and some of us are lucky enough to be living our dreams.  Yeah.  So what's the difference?  We're not crying every day because we're living our dreams.  Speak for yourself.  You cry every day, Jimmy.  On the elevator on the way up.  I don't care.  I don't care how much this crybaby stands there and weeps.  The idea that Pelosi is finally fucking out.  Will you admit he's a crybaby at least?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  She does suck.  She just sucks. 
[00:20:30]  How long did she last?  Two years?  Yep.  Two years.  And then she was voted in now as minority leader, but not unanimously.  A lot of Democrats were like, nope, don't want to vote for you.  You suck.  They hate her.  And they know she's hated.  Yeah.  She's seen as...  She should have not accepted the post of a minority leader.  She's an arrogant bitch.  She is.  Just an arrogant, fucking delusional asshole.  And I don't like the way she threw the fucking CIA under the bus either.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking twat. 
[00:21:00]  She threw the CIA under the bus.  I didn't know.  They didn't preach.  Really?  Look at her.  Look at her.  Handing over the gavel.  Her big gavel.  Smell the handle.  Smell the handle.  I bet she used that the first night.  She became Speaker of the House.  What part, though?  Yeah, which end?  Wow.  She could do the hammery end.  That's impressive, huh?  Do we have any sound of him crying again?  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio. 
[00:21:30]  There he is.  With two very bad knees.  Yeah.  Bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Did that dream ever...  What happened with the dream?  Sir?  Who do you credit?  Thank God that the dream came true.  Ah.  Oh.  He thanks God that the dream came true.  And he thanks God that he's such a crybaby that that will live on forever.  I'm sorry.  That will never get old.  Oh.  I know we pound things into the ground in this show, but that one will never get old. 
[00:22:00]  I am so glad I did not grow up in the age of video in any way, shape, or form.  There was 8mm film, but no sound, which is good.  Because it would have just been me crying all the time.  There would have been so many clips of me just crying as a little kid.  I cried a lot as a kid, too.  No one cried as much as me.  I know that.  I grew out of it, thank God.  Oh.  I was just... 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  But even the 8mm, me playing the drums with my brother on Christmas morning.  Right.  And the drum kit kept sliding forward, and I just burst into tears.  I start crying.  Why?  And I'm just looking up going...  I'm hitting my shoulders with the drumsticks and looking at the cameras and going,  the drums keep moving.  Can we see that?  Jimmy...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's got to be somewhere.  I know I posted it.  Oh, you did finally post it.  I posted it somewhere, so it's got to be online. 
[00:23:00]  Jimmy's saying why, but you came in here and cried over Ebert.  Yeah, but at least it was a guy who had cancer.  That was hilarious.  Yeah, but you don't know the motherfucker.  Who cares?  What was Oprah's question that got me?  Yeah.  That was all it was.  Which one was it again?  Something that was the last thing you ever said to your wife.  Trying to get him to do it again.  No, I won't.  I'm not overtired.  But it was something about what was the last thing you said to your wife.  That's just a depressing question to have your voice taken from you.  My lower jaw hurts as going to the doctor.  Ouch.  I think I swallowed something and it won't move. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, God.  Hey, how do you feel about Halloween masks?  You're going to be fucking one.  Oh, shit.  I love that.  Yeah, let me take those tears away.  I love how that fat bitch that he's married to goes and has her fucking lunch by herself.  Yeah, well.  She's not sacrificing any food because he can't eat.  Just looking at what that must look like.  And he has to go upstairs because it pains him too much to watch her eat.  Oh, come on.  I'd rather watch Brundlefly eat. 
[00:24:00]  I'd rather sit with Brundlefly.  It's one of the greatest interviews ever because there's so much fucked up things going on in that interview.  Yeah.  So Boehner crying once again.  Boehner.  I told Ann, I think a guy's supposed to cry less than 10 times in his entire life.  No.  Oh, fuck yeah.  No.  That's why we're all, that's why men have such fucking heart attacks and anger issues because we hold everything in.  You just scream a lot and then you get the fucking cholesterol out.  Get it out?  You scream.  Yeah.  You scream.  Or does it come out in tears like melted butter? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  It's just uncomfortable when an older guy cries though, isn't it?  No, I don't care.  No.  Yeah.  You know what you do?  You're crying in private.  And then you get it out of your system for five minutes and then that's it.  When's the last time you cried?  I don't want to hear it again.  When's the last time you wept about anything?  Wept.  Yeah, like we're really crying.  It was a while ago.  I mean really wept.  Like some grandmother.  But I could get a, I could get like a.  Yeah.  Moment where you gotta like suck it up, suck it up. 
[00:25:00]  Don't fucking get it.  And then it goes away.  Well, you gotta breathe with your mouth open like.  Keep your eyes open really wide so your chick doesn't realize you're a fucking.  Pansy.  You would do that where you're like.  You know if you blink.  Fucking teddy tears are coming out.  You're gonna be fucking.  You're gonna be tinny teardrops.  You gotta let the air keep your eyeballs dry.  That's what you do. 
[00:25:30]  I'd be watching Lost and I would feel one coming.  Lost.  Lost made you cry.  I cried through the whole first season of Lost.  Believe me.  You are a fairy Mary.  Oh, fucking faggot boy McGillicuddy with no hyphen.  That was my name.  Couldn't stop crying.  Really?  I'm the worst.  But I during TV always gets me.  That's where my emotion comes out.  Yeah, I get I get a little of that going on.  Yeah.  Fucking that stupid biggest loser show.  Are you kidding?  That?  I don't know.  I never got it.  Wow.  The new season has these twin brothers, Dan and Don. 
[00:26:00]  They are horrendous looking with horrible mustaches.  And one of the guys lost his son to like drugs.  Yeah.  The drugs.  24 year old.  He's dead.  And he's telling his little story.  And how he needs to lose weight in honor of his dead son.  I'm like.  Oh boy.  I'm done.  A couple tears.  Now the old war documentaries, like I always say, that's the only thing that gets me.  Having the old timers talk about their dead friends.  Before you move on, look at how awful these two are on The Biggest Loser. 
[00:26:30]  It's the same show every four months, but I'm hooked.  I don't know why I'm hooked on this dumb show.  Although this year, they have a, what?  Yeah, there they are.  There's, check out Dan and Don.  How the fuck is that?  Just horrendous fucking mustaches.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But what's important about The Biggest Loser this year, they got an old Olympic athlete  that we all remember too.  Mark Spitz.  Mark Spitz.  That's right, Anthony.  He now weighs 400 pounds. 
[00:27:00]  Nadia Komenich.  That's right.  She's got a huge bunt now.  Wow.  It's a, it was a Roman greco wrestler.  A greco Roman wrestle.  He, when did he win?  2000.  He, he won the Olympics in 2000.  Did he win by fucking man and ass to humble him?  And he's part of The Biggest Loser cast.  He's now, he weighs, I think, over 400 pounds.  He's a slob.  Couldn't take it.  He's a fucking slob. 
[00:27:30]  How did he just eat?  And he, he was a hero and won a, uh, Olympic medal.  Wow.  And now he's on the show trying to lose, lose all the weight he gained.  Hey, fatso, get a load of fatso there.  Yeah, enough with Biggest Loser.  Who watches that stupid show?  Except fucking losers like myself.  Yeah, I don't, uh.  I don't know why I watch.  My, my girl's even frustrated.  She's like, it's the same fucking show every three months.  Why?  I don't, I don't know why.  You know what I mean?  You made me cry.  The, the Christmas special of The Office.  The British Office, I thought was pretty sweet. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was good.  That was kind of a last thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's, it's, uh.  Yeah.  Just, yeah, right there.  Fourth guy in.  Right there.  Do you guys remember this guy?  If you saw, like, um, what he used to look like, you would sort of remember him.  Rulon.  I have no idea.  This guy won an Olympic gold medal and now he weighs, what is his starting weight?  He looks like a wrestler, though.  Yeah, I mean, he's a bigger guy to begin with.  Uh, I don't know what his starting weight was, but he's a, he's a really big guy now. 
[00:28:30]  I don't think.  470, it looks like.  Holy shit.  No.  Is he 30 feet tall?  He's 470 pounds.  Was that a start at 470?  Safe to say when he was wrestling, he was in the 200s.  Safe to say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's compulsive.  I would never even watch the wrestling on the, in the Olympics.  Of course not.  It's like, what the fuck?  Do they even tell him that?  I'm not a big fan of the Summer Olympics in general.  I love the Winter Olympics.  Summer Olympics got the, uh, what, the gymnastics. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, the gymnastics are all right.  That's right.  If you're like little girls with little boobies.  Problem?  Why don't you sit down and watch the Olympics?  Have some lemonade and cookies.  Hook these electrodes up to your genitals and see if they, if they move a little.  If it jumps.  Jumpes off the fucking paper.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Look at that queen.  No, that's Walt Frazier.  Oh.  We had him in.  I know.  He's in a camo suit.  It's a suit, but it's camouflage. 
[00:29:30]  He was known for dressing flashy.  I don't know.  What's that about?  It's like a notch.  What's going on with Walt Frazier?  I was watching a program on, uh, serial killers and, and murderers in general.  And this guy kind of categorizes them from a level one to level 22.  Wow.  Yeah.  Based on how they kill, um, the reason they kill their, their upbringing, um, the viciousness  of the murders, uh, and like a level 22 was, um, was Jeffrey Dahmer. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Bundy, people like that.  Why 22 though?  I don't know.  He just figured there were 22 levels.  Weird.  Yeah.  And then there's, uh, you know, people that, um, like a woman that, uh, kills her husband  because he's beats her.  It's like, oh, that's okay.  You know, five and things like that.  So there's a whole level thing going on there.  It's not just serial killers.  Anybody who commits a murder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's murder.  The serial killers are always very far up there. 
[00:30:30]  Uh, and, uh, for the, some of the sexual killers and predators, they have a test that  they, this guy was giving them and the guy sits in a room and he's  watching, uh, television with, uh, some pornography on it and he's listening to audio of somebody  like reading saying, okay, you, you're taking the girl and, and then they give a kind of  a romantic kind of a picture.  They paint with the, with the words you're, uh, with her, you're having fun, a good time. 
[00:31:00]  And then there's other, you're beating her, you're punching her in the face and they take  this rubber bandy thing hooked up with a wire and put it around his cock and they plug  it into this machine and they could tell if the, the cock is throbbing and starting to  get fucking filled up with blood and, and they, you know, coincide it with what's being  said and shit like that.  I would love slash hate to have one of those machines in here.  I know.  That's all I was thinking was like, how embarrassing would it be? 
[00:31:30]  Cause there have probably been a few instances where I was reading something or heard a story,  uh, on the news or whatever that probably should not have been titillating.  Yet you're, you're like not getting a rod and jerking off, but you're kind of going  like, there's something fucking sexually like hot about that.  It just, I know there's no fucking way this should be.  I think you're talking for everybody listening. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I really do.  It's just, you just don't want to admit it.  But every once in a while you're like, Oh shit, that is kind of despicable, but, but  it's kind of not like that Terry Schiavo story.  That could be the hottest one.  I don't think, I don't think with a, uh, I don't think the rubber band is moving.  It was called most evil.  I believe you chubbed most evil, right?  Most evil.  It's called most evil.  Yeah.  I watch all those shows on that fucking, uh, uh, channel, whatever it's on. 
[00:32:30]  Love the goddamn crime shows.  Can't get enough locked up abroad.  Oh, those are great.  That's a great show.  This poor motherfucker is just like, got, got so screwed trying to smuggle heroin out  of Bangkok, Bangkok to LA smuggling heroin.  It's like, Oh, what are you thinking?  Cause first he was just smuggling, uh, hookers from Bangkok to Hong Kong.  How do you, how do you do that? 
[00:33:00]  You, you, you get on the plane with all this documentation that says you two are fucking  married and you get the story straight.  Both sides have to have the story fucking down.  Completely down.  And the girl speaks English or no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's speaking, she's speaking a little English, uh, and, and that worked for him.  And then this syndicate that was paying the guy off decides, look, we got the, you did  a really good job.  We like how you handled yourself in that situation.  We got a bigger and better, uh, more lucrative deal for you. 
[00:33:30]  We want you to take a fuckload of heroin from Bangkok to LA.  And he's like, Oh yeah.  But the way they approached him was like, almost like you can't say no kind of a thing.  He got, he got in deep and, uh, he took it.  He went, had a few fuck ups at the airport where he missed his flight and had to take the  shit back.  It was already checked the baggage, had to take the bag of heroin back.  Why did he miss the flight?  Uh, there was his cab got into an accident and he's there with heroin. 
[00:34:00]  And you watch these shows and get so nervous.  Well, you watch them and just get like, ah, it's like, it's like a dream.  We all have.  Yes, exactly.  It's one of those dreams where you're in trouble.  When you open your eyes, you're like, thank fucking God.  That was a dream.  Yep.  You see, have you seen, uh, I almost got away with it.  Yeah.  I love that.  That's a great one too.  That one's good.  I love it because it's not a narrator telling you the story.  It's the guy.  It's the guy that killed people or robbed banks or something.  And there was one guy I was watching.  He was, he was saying how he was dealing drugs, making money and just, and like he flat out, 
[00:34:30]  you could tell in his eyes, he had,  he was like, it was the greatest time I ever had in my entire life.  Hey, they love it.  I almost got away with it.  Deadly Women's great.  I love that one.  Deadly Women is a good one.  The fucking craziest frauds killing their husbands for insurance money.  There's something so much crazier about a chick doing that stuff than a guy.  I don't know what it is for me, but like, if you could tell me like, oh, a guy murders  his wife for some money, I'd be like, yeah, or whatever.  But when it's a girl, I'm like the, sometimes they're so crazy and there are elaborate schemes 
[00:35:00]  that they go through.  You're like, I cannot stop watching.  The poisoning over time for insurance money that these women do.  And that's a, that one is so common.  The second a guy drops dead like that, it's just, they always look at the woman, just like  the other way around.  I could spot the guilty guy now in a second when they try to pull those shenanigans, like  and the mystery had this small town captivated.  They didn't know who the murderer was.  I'm like, yeah, it's so obvious or I'll watch it. 
[00:35:30]  It's like not the husband, but you'll go, all right, affair.  She's fucking someone.  And the guy that she's fucking killed the husband.  Yeah, there it is.  It's gotta be easy to solve murders in general and general and I guess.  It seems like it just follows the same patterns.  A lot of them do.  Some of them take years though.  But go back to that story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened with that?  Oh, the heroin guy.  So the cab gets in an accident.  Cab gets in an accident.  So now his plane's late.  He rushes to the airport.  He checks the bag with the heroin in it and, uh, and they tell him flight's closed. 
[00:36:00]  The flight's closed.  So it's like, fuck, man.  He had to get the bag, go back.  And he's pretty much going to get away with it if he could walk through the gate.  Well, he didn't know.  You don't know.  At that point, you just don't fucking know.  Wow, your bag's already checked.  Well, you haven't gotten the customs yet.  Yeah, you haven't gotten the customs.  So he had a few more steps.  He had a few more steps once you get into LA.  Gotcha.  Shit like that.  Uh, he was some Australian guy.  So back to the hotel next morning.  He had a lot more time. 
[00:36:30]  So he was a little more relaxed.  He said, uh, goes up, checks the bag again.  Um, and then, uh, the, the one guy starts looking at his ticket and he said, I noticed it was taking a little longer than it should have.  And, and I started getting a little nervous.  Oh, shit.  And, and you're just sitting there watching going, oh, no.  Just leave the airport.  Run home.  That's exactly what you think.  Run.  And, um, they, one guy said, could you come with me?  It's never good. 
[00:37:00]  And they grabbed the bag.  They took him in a room.  And they asked, is this bag yours?  They're like, he's like, yeah.  They opened it up.  And he said, he turned his head.  He didn't even want to look at the amount of heroin that was in this fucking bag.  It was just, uh, kilos.  And, um, they, uh, they sentenced them to, uh, life.  And he found out when he was in prison that the guy that made the deal with him had been arrested, uh, prior to that and totally set him up with the heroin. 
[00:37:30]  Like, the heroin thing was a complete setup.  So he wasn't going to get away with it.  It was, no.  It was just a deal where he had, he had gotten the whores to Hong Kong.  And this heroin thing was the guy that set it up, got arrested, said, I'll cooperate.  I got this Aussie guy.  I'll be able to give you him.  And they're like, all right.  And that guy, the guy that set him up wound up, uh, being found dead.  Uh, and, and, and the guy was so depressed.  The Aussie was so depressed in jail.  He started doing heroin in jail. 
[00:38:00]  So he starts snorting it to feel better because his parents were just like going through hell.  He said, then he started shooting up heroin in Bangkok and sharing needles.  Oh, boy.  Guess who got the hiv?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  He wound up getting the hiv.  Is he out of jail?  Uh, he started showing signs and getting sick.  And I guess the Australian government stepped in and they wound up getting him back to Australia  where he got medical treatment.  And now he's alive, uh, doing well, married.  And, uh, they showed him last scene. 
[00:38:30]  They showed him walking on the beach with his, uh, chubby Aussie wife.  So what happens to the life in prison thing?  He got away, you know, life in prison in Bangkok.  It means you're dying.  Right.  Or you're going home.  Take this with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He got AIDS motherfucker.  There, there's your life sentence.  Hey, uh, now if this guy could prove that he had no choice and he had a smuggle of heroin  or, or he was going to be killed to Bangkok, they don't care.  Authorities don't give a shit about that.  One thing about locked up abroad.  When you watch this, you realize the tricks and ploys and loopholes and lawyer shit that 
[00:39:00]  happens in this country is they must laugh their balls off in these other countries.  Everywhere else.  They do not want to hear shit.  They, and they don't handle evidence, uh, very well.  They just, Hey, you got this.  It's on you.  We don't care that the bag was out of your possession for a while at this.  Like in the, in the United States, a lot of these cases, they'd be like, Hey, this bag  was sitting on a runway, uh, for 15 hours. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  I didn't know what the fuck was in there.  Reasonable doubt.  They just go, yeah, here it is.  Here's the heroin.  Here's take some pictures of you with the heroin.  Now we're going to burn the heroin, uh, and just ship you off to fucking prison.  And the thing is you can, I think, buy your way out of those.  Yes.  A little bit easier.  Yep.  Just keep it quiet.  Don't make a big media stink out of it.  I think you have an easier time bribing.  I watched that, uh, documentary on the ganja queen.  They called her, uh, Chappelle, uh, Cordy or something. 
[00:40:00]  Her name is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, uh, she was, uh, another Aussie that, uh, got caught with a fuckload of weed.  How much pounds of weed going to Indonesia, which is punishable by death.  Yeah.  By death.  10 pounds.  It was enough to kill them.  It was in a boogie board bag that she had.  And, uh, there was a lot of, uh, completely reasonable doubt that she didn't do it.  Uh, I'm not sure watching it.  I still wasn't sure if she knew about it, was in on it, was forced, whatever it was.  But the, the bag was out of our possession long enough. 
[00:40:30]  And there were enough other people that could have been implicated in it, but they grabbed  her and, uh, wow.  Oh, did they put her through some shit.  They could have probably bought her way out of it.  Chappelle, Cordy, I think.  Yeah, but it, it turned into a giant media circus and then she's really hot.  Yeah.  She was cute.  Oh, she was.  Hey, an Indonesian prison.  I'll put a few years on you and throw a little slime on you.  The Indonesian prosecutor had to prosecute her because he was called out like publicly by 
[00:41:00]  this Australian guy who was trying to help her.  And it's a quietly behind the scenes.  They probably could have just bought her way out of it.  But this dummy had to make a big thing about it.  And the prosecutor brought up the bribes and everything.  And the prosecutor was like, Hey, really?  Well, fuck you.  Fuck her.  I actually think she did do it because I read stuff after.  I do too, yeah.  And they said that when you, you saw the guy interviewed the, the guy in the airport who  actually called us and said, Hey, and he said that when the bag came or something, he 
[00:41:30]  said, she looked, she knew like, you believe this guy.  You don't think he's lying.  He's a little older guy.  He's like, you just got this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You talk to some of these people and they just know by looking at you.  It's like the customs agents.  They can know.  I think everyone gets this, uh, guilty feeling walking through customs.  I know I did.  And it was the same thing when I would go out, walk into a store as a kid, not buy  something and walk out. 
[00:42:00]  I'd always feel compelled to stop by the magazines right by the door just to be like, look, I'm  not running out of here.  If I stole something, I'd be hightailing it, but I'm still, you know, I think that's me.  I might want to impulse buy.  Once again, I think that's a normal feeling that I think all of us get.  We get this.  I really do.  And customs is the same way, even though I know, you know, I'm not doing anything.  I'm, I'm completely legit, but the way they look at you and question you, you, you feel  like you're doing something wrong and you're not looking at them the right way or, or answering 
[00:42:30]  his pleasantries correctly.  You know, it's like, uh, so how are you doing today?  Heroin!  I'm doing very cocaine today.  You just, ah.  You find yourself just babbling.  Yeah, yeah.  And over explaining why you're in the country.  You almost want to make conversation with like, so how are you doing?  I'm just here to drink a couple of faggy drinks and get a 10, but you make it more than it  is.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything to declare, did you do that?  And you want to turn to him as he's, as he's like looking at his forms and writing 
[00:43:00]  stuff and you're just silent.  You feel like going like, so, uh, you know, how long you, you've been doing this?  Yeah.  Really?  Why do you want to know?  Yeah.  All right.  In the back, full body cavity search.  Just shut your fucking mouth.  That's why you just shut up.  Take your fucking passport back.  Thank you.  It's like the soup Nazi.  And then they hand your passports back and then you feel like, really?  You're going to let me go?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  And then it's like, okay, right around here.  Oh, what's around this corner?  You grab your bag and you walk away.  You expect to hear like, hello, come back. 
[00:43:30]  And you're completely innocent, but yeah, you got nothing.  And the passport's back.  You're like, why isn't he checking me?  Don't you understand?  I'm a drug smuggler.  I'm sweating.  You don't want to sweat on those lines.  That's like, they, they always show the person sweating and that's the end.  It's just this guilt we get for no reason.  I'm never nervous coming back into the U.S.  Never.  Really?  No.  You're a better man than me.  Never.  Going somewhere else, you're in another country.  But in the U.S., this is my home and it's like, I'm the fucking, the annoyed American. 
[00:44:00]  I really do have nothing to hide coming back in.  The annoyed American.  I got nothing.  It's like, they want to break my balls.  They can, but it's like, look through all the luggage.  You're going to find nothing.  I don't touch drugs.  You go somewhere else and you don't know that something you have is illegal.  I'm not worried about-  It's a turtleneck.  It's 20 years.  Exactly.  Wait a minute.  Because you look like a turtle, but sir, my neck is fat.  I can't help it.  But if you're annoyed at the line, I don't think that hurts you because criminals are  usually like, you're trying so hard to be pleasant, you're not annoyed. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  But there's a line, you're like, ah, come on.  And they have people looking.  It's not like right when you get up to the customs guy and he's the guy that's making the  assessment.  They have those people that just kind of walk around looking at the line.  I'm sure on the cover people here and there.  They're just looking for someone that's a little suspicious.  I'm sure they've got the cameras, too, and they're seeing who's fidgety on line.  They're paying a little too much attention to their bag.  They know the signs.  They're well-trained.  Yeah.  They're well-trained.  They know. 
[00:45:00]  Unless you're going to one of these Caribbean islands.  Holy shit.  And that's why I love being Mr. Carry-On Bag Guy.  Holy shit.  Because I don't like the idea of my bag being just out of my sight.  In a weird country.  Yeah, because who knows who's sliding something in there.  Could you imagine getting back and they go, can we go through your bag?  And you're like, yeah, go ahead.  And they open up and you just see this plastic bag and go, wait a minute.  Because now you sound like every fucking drug dealer.  All of a sudden you just see a brick that's tightly wrapped in fucking plastic. 
[00:45:30]  Like, wait, that's not mine.  And they're like, oh, really?  No, really?  Really?  Really?  How would you prove it's not?  And they take that knife and open it up and you just see white powder come out and go  like, oh, my God.  And, oh, my fucking God, I am so fucked.  Yeah, then you realize it's like they said in the Ganja Queen that it's really the baggage  handlers who are using people's luggage to ship it from country to country.  Yeah, yeah, to just ship it back and forth and see what happens.  Holy shit, I'm never fucking checking a bag again.  Wouldn't you just go like. 
[00:46:00]  You just changed me.  And you'd say everything the drug dealers say.  Right.  It's not mine.  I don't know how it got in there.  Someone put it in there.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, come with us.  Right.  And you know what?  You're not explaining your way out of that.  You're going to some shitty jail until you talk to the consulate and a lawyer and everything.  And you're fucking being run through this system that makes the American system look like  a joke.  It's just scary.  I would immediately tell them to take fingerprints from it. 
[00:46:30]  Not that it matters, but I'd be like, fingerprint that.  They'd be like, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Are you the fucking head of.  No, but I would say my fingerprints.  I didn't touch that.  Yeah.  How about we just take your fingers?  I prefer you to take your fingers off.  You loudly proclaim that is not my heroin.  Point at it.  That's creepy.  All right.  We should we should take our first break.  We got lots to do.  We got we got an update on the golden voice radio guy.  Ted Williams on Fox 28. 
[00:47:00]  That fucking video.  How many views now, man?  Look, as we talk about it.  There you go.  It's on CNN again.  I don't think a video has ever been hotter on YouTube as quickly as this one.  And we have some great observations that I don't think everyone's making on this one.  Well, and we said he would have a record and he certainly has a record.  And we'll explain that after the break.  Nothing that terrible.  And he's now following me on Twitter.  He's following me on Twitter.  Is he? 
[00:47:30]  Him and 18 other guys claiming to be him.  That's not that bad.  Huh?  No sexual robbery?  Nah, come on.  He's getting drugs.  He's a felon.  And we'll talk about his rap sheet next.  And some new audio from the guy, including a commercial he did back in 2008.  The golden radio voice guy.  Hey, when you have to piss, I usually choose the Department of Motor Vehicle rear door atrium.  Yes, if you have to take a piss.  So we got that. 
[00:48:00]  We got, let's not forget, Matt LeBlanc coming in a little later.  Patton Oswalt.  Patton Oswalt.  I make it sound like it's two people when I say his name.  And also, Canadian River mysteriously turns bright green.  Is Troy Kwan in today?  This could be another conspiracy.  Has he studied this?  And more birds and fish are dead around the world.  Of course.  It happens every day.  You think?  Yes. 
[00:48:30]  We'll get to the bottom of those things after these messages.  All right, let's talk about this golden radio voiced guy from Columbus, Ohio.  How many views is the video up to?  Did you check, Danny?  Something like almost 12 million.  Holy shit.  Just scraping it. 
[00:49:00]  And you know YouTube, they don't update in real time, so it's most likely it's much more than that.  Wow.  And there's a million versions now, too, and those versions are getting a lot of hits.  The fucking, the world is captivated by this guy.  Captivated by the guy with the golden radio voice.  They love him.  Honestly, I've been doing this a really long time.  Could be the best voice I've ever heard in radio.  He does have a good one.  I'm trying to think of some other guys that are right up there.  Guys that have voices that sound just like his. 
[00:49:30]  What's some of them other voices we use at?  I couldn't even name them.  Dan Ingram.  Don LaFontaine.  Don LaFontaine.  Don LaFontaine.  Who's now dead.  Yeah.  In a small tone.  That guy's dead.  Yes.  Yeah, well, he's a felon.  Yeah.  And we told you guys yesterday, it was just a matter of time before they did some digging  on this guy.  We thought it would be worse than, it turns out it is.  Well, this is.  It's a long rap sheet, Dan.  I agree with you. 
[00:50:00]  But there's nothing, there's no kid touching in here or any of that shit.  I see six mug shots.  All right.  I see some charges here that aren't just, like, if it was just theft, I can understand  that.  The theft is, you know, you walk into a store, you grab some shit, you leave because you're  hungry or whatever.  The robbery one is a little much because that's confronting somebody.  Well, he was hungry.  He's homeless.  Well, but robbery is, you're robbing somebody. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, that's robbing somebody.  Meet the felon with the golden voice.  Before becoming the country's most distinctive new voice, Ted Williams compiled a lengthy rap  sheet that landed him in several Ohio lockups on a variety of criminal charges, according  to law enforcement records.  This guy's only 53, by the way.  Oh, it's a few hard years.  And doesn't he look like an aging 70s baseball player? 
[00:51:00]  He looks like Pryor in one of those shots.  Yeah.  His mustache.  He's got a little Pryor action.  He's got a little Obama in him when he's all clean cut now.  Yeah, he looks like somebody else, too.  I can't put my finger on it.  Freddie Prinze.  Freddie Prinze.  Freddie Prinze.  Yeah.  Is that how you say his name?  Freddie Prinze.  P-R-I-N-Z.  I used to say Prince.  No.  Freddie Prinze.  No, it's Freddie Prinze.  Prinze.  Uh, he's 53.  Has been busted for theft, robbery, escape, forgery, and drug possession. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Uh, the convicted felon's speedy rise to fame is not sitting well with one Columbus businessman  who called cops on Williams and a female companion in early July.  The man, a manager at National Tire and Battery.  Uh, you know, this guy was a real prick, too.  What a fucking asshole.  Why don't we keep this as a nice, happy story for everyone?  But no, the manager at the National Tire and Battery store is real.  Well, it's pretty busy here, but that's the way we like it.  Right. 
[00:52:00]  Told cops that Williams and the woman were refusing to leave the business property and had become  an ongoing problem for the business, according to a police report.  I guess people couldn't get their tires and batteries.  Yeah.  Because of Ted Williams and his golden radio voice were camped outside.  Yeah.  Uh, while Williams begged customers for money, the woman gets picked up and dropped off in  the parking lot by various and numerous males in different vehicles.  Uh-oh.  Hinting that the, uh, the woman is a hoover. 
[00:52:30]  I thought I was just doing very well with you.  Uh, the management has repeatedly asked the two suspects to stay off the property and have  been cussed and yelled at by the suspects for their effort.  Ah.  You don't like the manager of the National Tire and Battery store?  No, he's an ass.  You think he's an ass?  Oh, he's one of these guys, you know, he's, he's probably got battery salesman of the  year, pictures hanging up and just what an ass. 
[00:53:00]  Fucking daddy nailed it.  Yeah, a little Lionel Richie.  He's got some Lionel Richie.  If Lionel Richie had a little, uh, crack problem.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking A, yeah, that's the guy I was thinking of.  Lionel Richie.  Uh, cops warned Williams and his companion that they would be arrested if they returned  to the property.  The businessman who only wanted to be identified as Dan, uh, told, I guess, the paper, the  TSG.  What's the TSG?  The smoking gun.  Oh, the smoking gun.  Okay.  That Williams, uh, newfound notoriety had left him a little aggravated, Anthony. 
[00:53:30]  The man said that he had seen Williams urinate in front of the business and watched recently  as he and his female friend stripped to their underwear as they changed into dry clothes  during a rainstorm.  But where the fuck is this guy supposed to go?  Yeah, it's true.  He chose your place.  Sorry.  He's so, this guy is so fucking just fuddy-duddy.  Right.  Like, I can understand the changing, you know, the guy wants dry clothes and shit.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  But Mr. Fucking Battery Salesman.  Yeah, where, if you live in New York, you get used to homeless guys taking shits in front  and they had taken leaks.  Yeah.  And certainly you will see them change clothes right in front of women and children.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't have a place to change.  So wherever they are, they're going to change it to relatively fresher clothes.  Dan added, good old Dan from the National Tire and Battery Store.  National Tire and Battery Store. 
[00:54:30]  Dan added that his company shares a lot with a Lowe's store and he has seen Williams stealing  items from cars parked by customers visiting the home improvement firm.  Dan's an asshole.  Dan is a douche.  I think Dan is jealous that this bum is now going to be well off in the coming years.  The bum.  Yeah.  He's basically been a thief for the past two years, Dan said.  The businessman added that last month he saw cops putting Williams in a squad car.  However, the Columbus Division of Police had no record of Williams being collared in December. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no record.  But it turns out he's, do you have his actual rap sheet?  No, I just, I got the mug shot.  I saw a rap sheet.  Someone else had, but yeah.  All right.  Busted for theft, robbery, escape, forgery, and drug possession.  It's typical shit for a homeless person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the shit though that's perfect in this society.  And I've never seen the turnaround so quick where they show the guy yesterday, literally yesterday, and talk about, wow, this rags to riches story. 
[00:55:30]  He's a homeless guy, great voice.  He's all over the news.  People want to give him jobs.  And the very next day they're like, well, meet the felon with the golden voice.  Like I've never seen the buildup tear down happen in a 24-hour period.  Did we say this would happen?  Oh, yeah.  The media couldn't wait to find something bad on this guy.  They couldn't, they were chomping at the bit, as we like to say. 
[00:56:00]  And we learned that he likes to pull his cock out and urinate.  Well, that's what you do if you don't have a home.  Where else are you supposed to be?  It's better than not pulling your cock out and urinating.  Right.  We've seen those homeless guys too.  Yes, we have.  They say, fuck it.  I'll just, I'll just make poo in my pants.  Spell them pulling your cock out and not urinating, just leaving it out.  Making that noise.  I was much more famous radio guy than him.  Hey, this is golden radio voice guy.  We had golden buns.  We had golden buns.  Too bad.  I wish he wasn't gone because it would be great to put together some kind of golden voice versus golden buns. 
[00:56:30]  Golden voice versus golden buns.  Oh, God, this is the battle of the homeless radio guys.  Why did that bum have to die on us?  You know, we still might be able to do some kind of production piece.  There's enough Tippy Tom audio and there's certainly enough audio of this homeless guy, Ted Williams.  Well, Ted was on, I guess, a radio show in Columbus that really isn't getting much recognition.  The fucking media.  He was on some radio show in Columbus yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  And he had this to say.  So we got a couple clips of Ted Williams.  The golden voice.  Here's Ted getting an offer from MTV.  Currently, I will just call him Ted the homeless DJ.  It's not medicine.  It's just a statement of fact.  So, Ted, your word in 24 hours has spread throughout the world.  And you are going to get what he thought yesterday at this time would bring you in.  It would pay you for a day.  See how that goes and see if we can find some work for you.  Yes, that's what you'd say.  That's exactly right.  And I was happy with that.  Believe me.  That's nothing.  We can't afford squat.  So here's what we're going to do, Ted. 
[00:57:30]  We've had emails, phone calls, offers.  I mean, literally from all over the world.  And I'll read these throughout the morning as we go.  Okay.  I mean, I have Hawaii.  I have Ireland.  I have people that are willing to fly you out to do voice work, to participate on their shows, hosting their shows, be guests on their shows.  And we'll unveil these as we go.  But we have some that wanted to talk to you in person.  So we'll go to our first one right now, Dave.  Bobby, is this you?  This is me.  Good morning.  Bobby is from MTV. 
[00:58:00]  Bobby, Ted.  Hello, Bobby.  Hey, Ted.  It's a pleasure.  Good morning, my friend.  It's so nice talking to you, too.  Well, listen, it takes a lot to get an L.A. boy to wake up at 4 in the morning.  Oh, man.  And I've got to tell you something.  I'm the executive producer of a show on MTV3.  Starring Paul Rodriguez called Miss Fidel's Locos.  It's a great comedy show that we've put on.  We've been on for a second season now.  And one of our staff came in yesterday to my office and said, you've got to see this piece of humanity, as she called it. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  All right.  Or shit.  What did she say?  I pretty much teared up.  And, you know, the greatest thing besides your voice was you admitting and saying how you had two years of sobriety.  And you did that with such simple pride, my friend.  Thank you, sir.  This guy.  Shut up.  This guy.  I'm calling to offer to fly you out here to L.A. to be our guest announcer on an episode that will be. 
[00:59:00]  I'm wondering if you'd like your tip.  I certainly would, sir.  Fucking bullshit.  I certainly would, Bobby.  Okay.  Bobby, thank you, man.  Yes, sir.  Listen, the pleasure is mine.  You're the Susan Boyle of DJs.  I just thought of that myself, Bob.  Ugly fat white English woman.  A couple.  Yeah, a couple things.  The L.A. guy, L.A. executive is a douchebag.  Of course he is.  He's just using this guy to promote his stupid project. 
[00:59:30]  Worse than battery tire guy.  Oh, absolutely.  Dan, you're off the hook.  You can continue selling your batteries and tires in peace.  We'll leave you alone.  Yeah.  But this is the L.A. douchebag.  He's just promoting his.  Plies him out for one lousy episode.  That's not a job, really.  No.  You give him a.  No, they're not offering him a job.  They pay him lousy to fly him coach.  Sure.  And then they're done with him.  And then he's back on the street.  Poss him out.  It's a fake fucking offer to get the name of your show out, which I already forgot, by the way.  Yeah.  I know it stars Paul Rodriguez.  Paul Rodriguez. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  So, fuck that guy.  So then the interview continued, and Ted gets the big offer.  Thank you!  That looks like he's going to take.  You heard.  Yes, I did.  The Cleveland Cavaliers.  Starting guard.  Yeah.  Just an amazing fucking.  Starting guard.  Wow.  Yeah.  The Cavaliers need all the help they can get.  And Ted Williams will be the starting guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers.  And this is him accepting the offer.  Yes.  But we're calling the Cleveland Cavalier office. 
[01:00:30]  And by the way, I give this radio show props.  Not too hacky.  Not too morning zoo-ish.  Wow.  Kind of using their own voices, sort of.  They're getting propellers.  So far, so good.  And power forward.  Number 23.  The homeless.  Ted Williams.  The homeless hooper.  I spoke too soon.  That was a little horrible.  Hi, Tracy.  How you doing?  Fabulous.  Hey, you're on with Dave and Jimmy.  We're here with Ted Williams, and we think you wanted to talk to him today.  Hi, Mr. Williams.  How are you?  Hello there, Tracy.  How are you? 
[01:01:00]  I am phenomenal.  Thank you.  And I'm even more excited now that I have the chance to talk to you and meet you.  Oh.  And we at the Cavaliers and Clique Mons Arena have been so inspired by your story, as I think the entire nation has.  Oh, thank you, Tracy.  And we certainly wanted to take the opportunity to step forward and say we would love for you to be a part of our amazing organization.  And, you know, the Cleveland Cavaliers, obviously, is a pretty dominant force in the NBA and certainly has raised a lot of attention over the years. 
[01:01:30]  But on top of that, what you might not know is our family of companies not only includes the Cleveland Cavaliers, it includes Clique Mons Arena, which is the dominant arena here.  Oh, my God.  Enough with the plugs.  I know.  They're always calling up just the plug shit.  But at least this is a real offer.  That L.A. executive drove me fucking nuts.  Listen, that poor shit.  Is it, though?  Because it sounds like, it just sounds like they're calling, plugging all their shit, the arena, the team, everything. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  And then they'll have them on for a little while.  Well, let's see what the offer is.  It's awesome.  It might be, if it's a guest announcer bullshit job again.  Let's see.  Here in town.  Uh-huh.  As well as the Lake Erie Monsters, the minor league hockey team, Quicken Loans, which is owned by our team owner, Dan Gilbert.  And we wanted to step forward and see if you'd be a part of our fine organization.  Oh, God.  In what way, Tracy?  Well, first of all, I think that, you know, obviously your talents are pretty well recorded over the national television. 
[01:02:30]  And all that we've been so inspired by is the power of your voice.  And certainly the other part is the power of your dreams and the power of your vision.  And that's everything that we're all about.  And so one of the things that we'd like to offer you is full-time work with both the Cleveland Cavaliers as well as with Quicken Loans Arena.  We have a lot of amazing voiceover opportunities.  We do tons of commercial work.  We do tons of broadcast work, both on radio as well as on television.  Oh, crazy. 
[01:03:00]  Quicken Loans is launching a new website where they're going to have animations that are going to need voiceovers included there.  And on top of it, because we know that you're a person who's trying to get up and on your feet,  Quicken Loans is actually offering to pay a mortgage on a home.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  That's the best deal ever.  So I'm going with that.  The Rocky music starts.  I'm going with that.  The Rocky music starts.  Down goes the fallout break.  Oh, my goodness.  Down goes the fallout break.  So we're playing Let's Make a Deal here. 
[01:03:30]  He just made a whole new version of sweat under my armpit.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  All right, slow down, though.  It's a mortgage in Cleveland.  All right.  Exactly.  Let's slow down a little bit.  You could have made that stand in there by the light with the sign.  You guys know we love Cleveland, but let's slow down a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Be real.  Some mortgage on a $30,000 house.  All right.  That's great for the Cavaliers.  We lost LeBron, but we have Ted the Pantshitter. 
[01:04:00]  What do you think of that offer, Anthony?  A little self-serving, obviously.  They've got a lot of info out there.  Very self-serving.  I would like to know, you know, how much a year.  And will he be announcing in the arena or no?  They probably have somebody.  But why?  Like, yeah, what are we doing?  Probably not.  They don't know if this guy, he could be one of these guys when he sees people, he shits  his pants and his voice goes away.  He obviously has something going on in that head of his.  Yeah.  Don't people understand, look, he's homeless. 
[01:04:30]  Homeless people, there is, like, they talk about these homeless people that have, you know,  fallen through the cracks.  There's a family, they lost their house, they're in shelters, they're this, that, whatever it is.  But homeless people like this guy and, like, all the homeless people we see outside, they're nuts.  They're fucking mentally ill.  There's something wrong with them.  You can't just scoop them up, give them a house and some fucking, a suit and expect them to carry on like a normal, productive member of society. 
[01:05:00]  He's crazy.  You know what?  I would normally agree with you, but let's not forget Eddie Murphy in a little movie.  Yeah.  Trading?  Trading places.  That's right, sir.  Yes.  Now, he was able to run.  And figure it all out.  A brokerage firm. 
[01:05:30]  That's right.  From the streets.  That's right.  Right from the streets.  He was able to walk right in.  We should take our cue from that fine film.  This is possible.  Yeah.  You know what?  He's not going to be the announcer of the Cleveland Cavaliers.  And the media made it sound like that yesterday.  Yeah.  Because if I know a little bit about the Cavaliers, I think they got a really good house announcer.  Oh.  Very distinctive, I do believe.  Maybe someone from Cleveland can help me out.  I don't think they're going to kick that guy to the curb anytime soon.  They do have an announcer. 
[01:06:00]  They got a really good one, too.  Mark Sherbert.  Mark Sherbert.  He's a fucking asshole.  Mark Sherbert.  What a dick.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is what I was kind of thinking.  I didn't make the point fully.  Bill and Georgia.  Go ahead, Bill.  Hey, what if this guy ends up being like that singing frog in the cartoon and when they  put him on stage, he just clams up. 
[01:06:30]  He just fucking ribbits.  Yeah, he ribbits on stage.  And then he's alone with the guy.  He's like, hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my drag time girl.  Very good.  That's what I should have done.  That hammers the point home.  We got Bruce in Ohio, it looks like.  Bruce.  Yeah, this is Bryce.  The Cavs announcer who's been there for 30 years is Joe Tate.  Never been a fan of the name Bryce.  Have you?  But he has a bad heart.  I haven't gone for a major surgery next day or two.  What happened?  He had a bad heart problem when he was there. 
[01:07:00]  Then he actually got left on the road.  And he stayed there for several days.  And they brought him back.  He's been too weak to have this heart surgery.  He had, like, pneumonia or something when he got out to, I don't know,  it was like Dallas, one of the first road trips.  So eventually he came back,  and he's been trying to build his strength up enough to have major heart surgery.  But he's going to be gone.  So he might be one of the announcers and do the voice work for all the commercials.  He doesn't know how to announce for an NBA team.  I don't think he's ever done that. 
[01:07:30]  They're not going to make him the announcer for the Cleveland Cavaliers.  It's going to be horseshit stuff behind the scenes.  He'll probably make a couple of announcements that they prerecord and play.  Oh, sure.  The exits are to the left.  Right.  And the bathrooms are right behind the dumpster outside.  Oh, you think that's it?  Yeah.  Just a couple.  Yeah, they'll probably have a couple of prerecorded things that he does you right.  But in general, he's going to be fucking selling tires and batteries.  He's probably going to be ending up selling Dan's tires and batteries.  No, tires and batteries. 
[01:08:00]  Tires and batteries.  Get it right.  He'll make the drama.  All right, Bryce.  Thank you.  Please drink responsibly.  And finally, oh, no, okay.  He talks about being a recovering alcoholic.  You right now are feeling good.  Your head is spinning.  Yes.  Is this a tough time for a recovering alcoholic?  Yes, it is.  I just made mention to you.  I said, now, I'm going to go to a meeting.  But I will say this.  I don't know whether to celebrate by having a drink, because God knows, I mean, there would 
[01:08:30]  nothing be better right now than some Seagram's.  That's not good.  You ain't lying.  Because then I'll be ready to do everybody's offer.  But no, I'm not going to do that, because I got this far, and no need turning back, because  nothing but great things are going to happen at this point.  But yes, it is.  For a recovering person, the anxiety that I'm having right now, I don't take any type of 
[01:09:00]  medications for any type of anxiety or any kind of psychotropic medications or anything  of that nature.  But right now, I could use a nerve pill.  Jesus.  That voice is great.  That voice is ridiculous.  Fucking ridiculous.  It's reverberating all over the place.  Back in 2008, he did a commercial that people found.  So he was saying.  2008? 
[01:09:30]  So a couple years ago, he was still trying to do some stuff.  Yeah, and now all of a sudden, he's the radio darling.  That's right.  This commercial's for Mel Waiters, I Got My Whiskey Tour.  Oh, shit.  This is how he sounded in 2008.  Coming to the capital city this New Year's Eve, it's the I've Got My Whiskey Tour, starring  Mel Waiters.  And I got my whiskey, got my whiskey.  That's right, performing live in concert at the CEC Entertainment Complex, 3587 East Livingston 
[01:10:00]  Avenue.  It's a cabaret, baby, so bring your own brown bag, and we'll bring the party favors.  Tickets are on sale at all Ticketmaster locations, $25 in advance, $35 at the door for the I've  Got My Whiskey Tour, starring Mel Waiters.  Oh, wait.  That's my production from AF.  Talking over the vocals.  Yes.  The music's too loud.  They call me Slappy.  Slappy.  Good for this guy.  I hope he figures it out.  And I hope he gets a real offer.  What if it's a...  A lot of horseshit offers that are self-serving. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, they want to pay a mortgage for him.  That's not bad.  Pat from Monocle.  Oh, cool.  Monocle's speculating it's a scam.  Huh?  Oh, no.  It was a serious scam.  The whole thing is a scam?  Yes.  He's speculating that it's one of those things like, you know, hey, I need a radio partner,  and he's going to be in a seat at Fenway.  Oh, yeah.  You think?  Big publicity stuff.  Hey, you put this guy out on the street.  Right.  All of a sudden, he's your afternoon DJ.  Yeah.  Taking out Opian Anthony. 
[01:11:00]  This guy works at WNCI and met Ted Williams yesterday.  Bill in Ohio.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I actually got to meet him yesterday.  Do you prefer Bill or Billikens?  Bill is fine.  Thank you, too.  And have you ever taken a conk in your mouth?  What?  No.  Bill, what do you do for WNCI?  Actually, I work as their traffic director for one of their sister stations.  Okay.  They're in the same building as us. 
[01:11:30]  Okay.  I had to deal with all that mess yesterday with all the TV people.  Was there a lot of TV people there?  Yes, a lot.  There were three satellite trucks outside.  All the local TV stations all had their remote trucks outside, and the hallway was just lined  with people.  So I think CNN was there, Fox News was there.  Looks like Oswald being brought in for questioning.  Were there people around the radio station hoping that they were going to get discovered  as well while CNN was in the building?  Well, everyone there is already working in the radio. 
[01:12:00]  They're not discovered.  They're in Columbus, Ohio.  Let's all relax.  Please.  We're all over the world, and we're still not discovered.  So this business is horseshit.  Trust me.  Well, I know.  I've heard you guys complaining over the years, and you know what?  I totally agree with you.  It's called our show.  What did he say?  I heard you guys complaining over the years.  That's called the Opium Avenue show.  If we don't have that, we don't have a show.  Right, haters?  Dicks. 
[01:12:30]  Go ahead, Phil.  Well, he was on Columbus Radio for a long time, and then the booze and drugs hit him,  and he's been in contact with a guy who works at another station, and like the commercial  you just heard in 2008, because every once in a while, the guy will finally get a hold  of him, and he'll voice a spot or two, and then he'll disappear for six months or whatever.  He just will pop up out of the blue from time to time.  So, he's really been homeless for the last several years. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  You have added nothing to our discussion.  That really was the most words with nothing I've ever heard.  So, you're saying he's a homeless guy.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  From Ohio, apparently.  The breaking story.  Ted Williams, formerly homeless.  Right.  Channel 5.  Yeah, formerly homeless, because he's going to get a lot of jobs out of this thing.  So, what do the Cavaliers offer him?  Because I'm still confused. 
[01:13:30]  Housing assistance, and I think just doing some announcement stuff from time to time.  That's all I've heard.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think everyone's cautious.  We got an offer yesterday for doing commercials for a credit union in town.  Some other offers, too.  That's good.  Maybe people are uncomfortable because he has a face like a Native American coin. 
[01:14:00]  He's not going to stay in Columbus.  This guy's a New Yorker, and he's going to get a New York offer.  He's going to get a real offer down here.  That's a good offer to pay for housing, though.  Yeah, it is, certainly.  He's supposed to be on CBS this morning, and I think he's doing Letterman one night, too.  He's doing, Fallon got him.  He's in New York right now, and he's probably going to stay in New York.  Oh, shut up.  Thank you.  Is he doing Fallon?  He actually did.  Thank you, Bill.  You're welcome.  No, I just wanted to give people an inside fucking scoop. 
[01:14:30]  Fallon's got him.  I think he's on tonight.  I hate to be bumped for the guy with the nice voice who's shit outdoors.  Hey, look, we know you've been at this 20 years, but this guy took a dump in 8-degree weather, and he sounds good.  Sorry.  Can you reschedule?  Yeah.  Breaking news.  Sirius XM just signed him.  $50 million, because that's what they do.  Yes, it's going to be all Ted all the time.  The mistake we made with these assholes, and here comes the complaining again. 
[01:15:00]  We actually told them we have radio experience.  Yes.  That was our fucking mistake.  And homes.  Yeah, you walk in here and tell these guys you have no fucking experience in radio, guess what?  They'll fucking back up the money truck.  But anyone with experience, fuck, don't say that if you have a job interview here.  Say you have absolutely no experience, and you have no intention of actually coming in, and they will give you a shitload of money.  That's how they operate.  That seems to be it.  Where the fuck is Eminem?  We're right next to his studio. 
[01:15:30]  I haven't seen him once in two years here.  Never will.  Been in this building, I think, close to two years.  Not once did we see the guy.  They wouldn't let him see the likes of us.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That was too much.  Too much for the guys down the hall.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's the homeless guy thing.  Yeah, so.  He's on the Today Show.  Look for him in Cleveland.  They couldn't get him out of Columbus, Ohio or Cleveland yesterday because he didn't have an ID.  Oh, they couldn't fly him.  Right.  So I was thinking, why wouldn't they just send someone to fucking drive him down here? 
[01:16:00]  We'll put him on a train if there is a train.  But they finally figured it out and he is down here in New York.  He's at the Today Show right now.  Oh, they flew him private.  Why don't we get him?  He could ride on the bottom of the train with one of those hobo sacks over his shoulder.  We should try, but it's going to be difficult now.  We got some fuelers out.  He's doing Fallon and the Today Show.  So, yeah, but he's going to walk out a door.  Let's fucking kidnap him.  Get him over here. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, right.  I'm going to read some shit.  That'll happen.  Give him a bottle of whiskey and send him on his way.  Exactly.  Have a belt of this.  Yeah.  Come on.  Fall off that wagon, you.  Holy shit.  We got Ted Williams on the phone.  Oh, really?  I knew this was going to happen.  I knew it.  Ted Williams.  How are you, sir?  What's up?  I'm good.  How are you, Opie?  I'm doing well.  Well, after much consideration, I appreciate the Cleveland offer, but I'm taking my talents  to South Beach. 
[01:17:00]  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  Shit, I thought that was the real Ted Williams.  Maybe the real Ted Williams will call in a few minutes here.  He might.  I'm hoping.  Williams calls in a few minutes.  Yeah.  I'm just hoping, Anthony.  Yeah, something tells me the, are they trying to get through to him?  Huh?  Is that what it is?  Yeah, yeah.  They're trying to get through to him.  We might have a lead on Ted Williams. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, we're just hoping that the number is correct.  My inside sources say, I guarantee that hotline's going to ring.  Really?  Yeah.  I guarantee it.  I guess we should just stall for a second or two here.  I hope that Ted Williams is ringing.  Don't you think he'll be on there, Jim?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, me too.  Hello?  Oh, hey. 
[01:18:00]  This is Ted Williams.  Hey, Ted.  How are you?  You're the guy with the golden radio voice.  Yeah, it's golden.  I ate so much gold.  I'm dropping Williams in my shorts.  Wow.  Ted's got some material, too.  Unbelievable.  You're not just an announcer.  You got some, yeah, like Ann said, some chops.  Yeah.  They're going to hire me to do some talking on the TV or something.  I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  Ted Williams.  Hey, I got it.  I got to go play some baseball.  Oh, like Ted Williams, the original Ted Williams.  Yeah, yeah.  I think, yeah.  Hope your life ends the same way.  You're hiding in a fucking freezer somewhere.  What's that?  Nothing.  Freezer?  Yeah, don't freeze it outside.  I got my gold bullions.  They're all cold.  Gold bullions again, huh?  Give me the goddamn phone, Chipper. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, shit.  Hey, who's this?  You know who this is?  Why do they have to ruin everything?  Oh, hi, Uncle Paul.  How are you?  Are you managing Ted Williams?  Yeah, changing Huck Finn.  Why are they taking that word out?  That's my favorite part.  You don't like that, huh?  I used to read that out loud on the train and look at people while I said it.  And I believe you have 140 chances to say that word in that book. 
[01:19:30]  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  I would throw it in sometimes when it didn't even belong there.  Like reading the title of the book?  Yeah, look, it's a nigger tree.  Nobody knew they weren't reading it.  Well, I would assume that would get you punched in the face, Uncle Paul, if you're on the train, reading that out loud.  Yeah, it's funny you should say that, Gregorio.  You're right.  Yeah.  State the obvious.  Yeah, once again, we should have cut this at one and done. 
[01:20:00]  Bye-bye, Ted Williams, Paul, guy.  Uncle.  All right, why don't we take a ring?  Let's not forget Matt LeBlanc at 830.  Yes.  Looking forward to that.  Jimmy, you missed it.  What happened?  We had Ted Williams on the phone.  Oh, how was he?  He was pretty good.  God bless him.  Might be coming in in a few minutes.  God bless his heart.  We're going to take a break. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  And when we return, whatever.  Mouth cock sucking.  Nice.  Oh, really?  Hey, man.  Sirius XM, the virus.  This is the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  You too, right? 
[01:21:00]  I was thinking about something.  Oh, I think someone on Twitter yesterday sent me a really cool version of Pride.  Maybe we could play that.  I think it was Turk Bentley.  Remember that fucking guy from our country?  Was it Dix?  Dix.  Dix Bentley.  I'm not sure.  I'm Dix Bentley.  This guy claiming greatest cover ever.  It's good.  It's not greatest cover ever, though. 
[01:21:30]  Maybe we could play a little piece of that if you find it real fast.  If not, who gives a fuck?  I've got to slow down my eating, man.  You all right?  I'm doing better, actually, for the last week or two.  I want a diet, but I don't know which one to do.  I fucked up so bad during the holidays.  Anyways, I ate a lot and, you know, a little poorly.  Not crazy bad, but enough where I feel like a couple extra pounds on me.  Sure.  And I was just, you know, working out with the trainer and stuff this week has been a night. 
[01:22:00]  We're getting back from vacation and then just starting to, you know, get back into the whole thing again.  Sure.  You just get the aches and pains again.  But it's really the only fucking way to do it.  Mm-hmm.  It really is.  Yeah, diets are horseshit because people get a goal weight.  I'm going to lose 40 pounds on the blah, blah diet.  And they lose the 40 pounds on the blah, blah diet.  So then they think, all right, I reached my goal.  And then they blow off the diet because the food sucks a dick. 
[01:22:30]  And then you go back to eating how you did.  And within six months, you're right back where you were in most cases.  How does any diet work unless you are going to do it for the rest of your life?  I tell people all the time, you can't sacrifice food.  You really can't.  So I try to tell people, you've got to take the time to find stuff.  And it's not easy.  That you enjoy eating that is healthy.  Yeah.  That's the only thing that will work long term. 
[01:23:00]  And, of course, moving around a little bit, maybe a workout program or get on a fucking bike or just get your body moving.  But all that other shit doesn't work in the end.  If you just don't look at fucking an entire cake or a pizza or something or a big cheeseburger and just decide to shove it down your mouth and not do any exercise.  Right.  You can't do that.  No.  You just can't.  There's food I would fuck eat.  I watch commercials for all the shitty fucking fast food places. 
[01:23:30]  Popeyes.  And I'm just like, not even Popeyes.  I don't have commercials yet.  Even like Wendy's and Burger King and stuff.  Like Burger King's got this thing where it's like you buy one chicken sandwich, you get the second one for free.  And all I want to do is get my free fucking chicken sandwich.  I just want to hold two of those things and fucking eat them.  Are you talking about the chicken sandwich that is wrapped in the chicken sandwich?  No, no, no, no.  How bad do you want that?  They said fuck the buns.  Why have buns when you can have more fucking fried chicken around the other chicken? 
[01:24:00]  This is a fucking breaded, fried fucking chicken shit on those rolls and it's got mayo on it.  And it just looks like I just want to palm two of them and fucking...  Is there anything better than mayo?  It's delicious.  Let's have a discussion.  It's delicious.  I don't eat it.  I very rarely eat it on a fried chicken sandwich.  Yeah, that is good. 
[01:24:30]  Oh my...  How many calories is that?  A thousand calories?  How about a nice ham and Swiss with a healthy helping of mayo?  Mustard on ham.  Mayo on turkey.  No.  No, you queer.  What's wrong with you?  Ham gets mustard, you fucking freaks of nature.  Yes, it does.  Ham gets mustard.  And turkey gets mayo.  Oh yeah, he's right.  No.  Yes.  Ham and Swiss with mayo.  No.  You fucking grew up with the delis on Long Island?  Yes, and it's ham and Swiss with mustard. 
[01:25:00]  No, that's with the bologna.  No, you know it eats bologna.  Bologna.  What about salami?  What do you do with that?  Salami's mayo?  Mustard.  No.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Bologna is for hot dogs.  Period.  Period.  I don't know what that goes on.  Wait a minute.  I would never have mayo on ham or salami. 
[01:25:30]  I would have ham and cheese with mayo.  Where the mayo comes out of the holes in the Swiss?  Yeah, he's right.  Oh my God.  Is there nothing better?  Turkey.  You get a little extra mayo because you got that hole in the Swiss.  Turkey and Swiss, you can mayo.  Turkey is a mayo meat.  Ham is a mustard meat.  Ham is a mustard meat.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Ham is a mustard meat.  Quick fucking survey.  What do they say in front of you?  Are they agreeing with you or me?  They all fucking loot.  Ham and Swiss mayo. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go.  Janine is saying, are open hand going to break up over a condiment break?  We're doing a condiment break.  Hey, and let's get into it right now.  What's your favorite condiment?  What diets work though?  Honestly, do any of them work?  All right.  What?  Do any of them work?  No, I think they work for the short term.  Yeah, they all work for the short term.  But here's the deal.  You can focus for the short term.  Anyone could do that.  If you fucking eat right, if you just eat right and exercise, you will lose weight. 
[01:26:30]  And you'll fucking put on some muscle.  I know this is coming out of nowhere, but...  Yeah, where did this...  Isn't he rocking on a diet for the new year?  Is he?  Yeah.  Oh my God, that face he just fucking made.  Did you see that face?  It wasn't.  I knew this had to be coming.  No, you're right.  This is just a discussion we're having.  And that is bullshit.  And out of nowhere...  Sam found out yesterday, and the smile on his face couldn't have been bigger.  Then he goes...  And then he comes back into the office.  He goes, this could go on the air, right? 
[01:27:00]  Yes, Sam, it can go.  Okay, and then he takes off.  What do you...  All right, let me take people inside the show.  Me and Ant don't give a fuck what you put on your ham at Swiss.  This was all about getting to E-Rock's diet and lack of sticking to it.  E-Rock has been on a diet...  For three days.  For three days.  Now he's been...  But I remember...  Wait a minute.  You were on a diet before vacation, right?  No.  I thought you were.  No.  Before you got married?  No. 
[01:27:30]  I was...  Ever?  No.  Oh, you were seeing a trainer?  That was a long time ago, too.  In a galaxy far...  Can I now talk about all the food you ate at the rest area?  The rest stop, whatever?  Uh-oh.  The rest area.  Did it come out of a hole in one of the stall walls?  That's when I knew...  Hot dog.  That's when I knew E-Rock was going to be off his diet.  We went to...  Where were we?  E-Rock?  AC, I guess?  Did a little AC action?  Oh, yeah.  Coming back from AC.  Coming back.  And we're at the fucking service areas.  And granted, really fucking hard to find something healthy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:28:00]  That didn't stop E-Rock, right?  E?  Chicken sandwich.  Rory Rogers.  Oh, God.  That's not even a chicken sandwich.  After we're having...  You know when you drive with someone, you're having that heart-to-heart?  You start talking about stuff you probably wouldn't talk about because we're on a ride.  And he's talking about how he wants to get healthy, and he's seeing the trainer, and this and that.  He's eating really well.  And fuck, the first stop we made, he grabbed that chicken sandwich.  Oh, God.  So what happened?  You started the diet for the new year?  Yeah, I'm trying something different. 
[01:28:30]  What are you doing?  It's the South Beach diet.  I don't fully understand it yet.  Oh, my God.  You're not doing the South Beach diet.  Are you watching Miami Vice reruns, too?  How old is the South Beach diet?  And what happens after you lose weight from the South Beach diet?  Then what do you do?  You can't do that just because you're washed up on South Beach.  Sorry, right?  Got you.  Yeah, I got it.  Well, this time I decided to be a bit more realistic and didn't set a goal. 
[01:29:00]  I'm just going to see how I can do adjusting to this.  What are you allowed to eat?  It's like no carbs, I think.  It's...  Eight tons of krill a day.  No carbs and sugars right now.  It's krill.  No carbs and sugars?  Yeah.  No.  When's the last time you had carbs and sugar?  Oh, New Year's Eve.  6 a.m.  Oh, cool. 
[01:29:30]  No Domino's?  Oh, yeah.  I had a little pizza.  Oh, man.  It was this little square.  What was that?  The flat crust?  The thin crust?  Pizza.  No, it's not pizza.  Yeah, no, it's pizza.  That's like trying to describe I only had a little piece of the cake.  Yeah, yeah.  I just put the tip in my mouth.  Right.  I didn't give a blowjob.  Right.  I'm still on the I don't eat cock diet.  Fucking... 
[01:30:00]  Is there anyone better than E-Rock?  I know Jimmy's a huge fan.  I love E-Rock.  E-Rock fucking rules.  There it is.  Miami Vice.  South Beach diet.  So what happened, Sam?  Take us through this.  Sam, with much glee here.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't realize this would come up on the air.  Oh, really?  You walked in and set this whole thing up for us during the break.  Just talking to you guys.  Well, we got dominoes yesterday because I guess Roland and E-Rock were trying to diet together  because E-Rock's been hanging out with Roland lately. 
[01:30:30]  And Roland, he enjoys a meal.  And he makes no secret about this.  Roland does enjoy eating.  He does enjoy eating.  We were at the Connecticut Casino.  We all went out to eat Roland and had goulash.  One in the morning.  Goulash?  One in the morning.  It looked amazing.  Fucking like my fucking Romanian grandmother.  He had goulash.  Was it with the noodles?  Yeah.  The egg noodles?  God damn it, I want that.  Egg noodles are the best thing.  Aren't they the best?  They just soak up gravy or anything.  Although they can't figure out the fucking bag they put it in. 
[01:31:00]  Why?  You just make one little slice in the bag to get to the egg noodles and they fall on the fucking floor.  Why is that?  Try to open up a bag of egg noodles.  Are there people hanging egg noodles in a closet?  What's up with the egg noodle bag?  They're all over the floor!  So, I don't know if E-Rock's wife realizes this or not, but Roland is going to destroy.  But Roland's on a diet, too. 
[01:31:30]  No, you see, Roland's going to destroy.  Roland told me he's eating better in the new year.  Well, here's the thing about Roland.  He's going to destroy any attempt that E-Rock makes at losing weight.  Gaining weight.  Yeah, it's a Freudian slip.  Because, like, for instance, yesterday, they started the South Beach diet together as two friends.  We're going to do this.  We're going to support each other.  We have each other's backs.  Then Roland walked into the office.  I can't have a shot.  This front.  Roland walked into the office and heard us talking about pizza. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  And so Roland decided yesterday for lunch, Domino's was the place to go.  And I said, yes, Roland, let's do this.  Domino's.  So, yesterday, the part of the South Beach diet that was no bread and no fruit, correct?  Yeah.  Ended up with an order of three medium pies and cheesy bread.  Cheesy bread is not a part of any diet.  Are you sure?  Not even South Beach?  Cheesy bread. 
[01:32:30]  What about one of those new wave type of fucking diets?  No.  Where you can eat nothing but cheese or something.  There's no diet that includes anything called cheesy bread.  I bet you there's some kind of cheese diet.  Did you eat cheesy bread?  No, I did not.  You wanted to, though, right?  No, it actually did not look that well.  It was good.  Come on.  It's cheese and bread.  Cheesy bread rules.  Can we start, Eric?  I found some videos online the other day, and I'm thinking maybe this could be Eric's  new diet.  The title of these videos is called Epic Mealtime.  Epic Mealtime?  I don't know if anybody, but people just make, it's a group of guys, and they just make the 
[01:33:00]  most ridiculous things for breakfast.  Oh, fuck.  Like ham-wrapped waffles, deep fried in beer batter.  Like, it sounds really good.  I'd love to try some of this stuff.  That sounds really good.  Do we have E-Rock try one of these every day?  No.  For the month of February.  We would have to get them made somewhere, but yeah, I would love to.  On our Valentine's Day, I love food.  I'd like to turn them into a little cherub.  Yeah.  We just want to get E-Rock so fat that they have to cut him out of his home one day.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:33:30]  Has the brand new Mrs. Nagel said anything about your weight?  Is that why you're on the diet?  Whose idea was South Beach diet?  Because she's fit.  She's in shape.  She's looking really good.  It was her idea.  It was her idea.  It was her idea.  How did she suggest it?  She said, could you please move to South Beach?  The book just showed up one day.  It was laying-  One of those.  One of those. 
[01:34:00]  She's leaving fatty books around.  Fatty books.  It was laying on the kitchen counter next to the microwave.  So I was like, oh, what is this?  And then later I find out, hey.  Next to the microwave, knowing he'll see it immediately.  Of course.  She left it under the cheese doodles.  Certainly wasn't on the treadmill.  Holy shit.  She wants you to do the South Beach diet, and she wants you to run back and forth to South  Beach as well.  Okay. 
[01:34:30]  Okay.  This is 5,000 calories, the bacon-wrapped ham, deep fried.  Obie just showed he was on a joke diet.  That was the South Black.  Oh, my.  That's 8,000 fucking calories.  Wow.  Whoa.  These guys are eating crazy breakfast.  Wait, wait.  Stop this.  For the 9,000 calorie fucking breakfast.  What was that?  Check, Daniel.  Well, they were count-  They were-  It's-  What am I trying to say here?  It's all together. 
[01:35:00]  It's not like that one meal was 9,000.  Like, everything that they've made so far-  Oh, they keep-  They're adding on.  They're adding on to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But-  Oh, my God.  Man, this shit looks good.  What's the-  Oh, that was-  I think chocolate-  Damn.  Chocolate and bacon-  Chocolate chip beer waffles.  Chocolate and bacon waffles.  Right.  Sounds delicious with some Jack Daniels sauce.  Oh, fucking yeah.  I want some of this.  Oh, boy, that'll help you lose weight, right?  The greatest food on-  The greatest food on Earth by far is bacon, by the way.  Let's not even argue-  I like turkey bacon, too.  Bacon is regular-  The greatest food on fucking Earth is bacon. 
[01:35:30]  It ends with that.  It gives me heartburn badly.  Yeah, but it's un-fucking-believable how good it tastes.  Bacon, cream, cheese, stuffed French toast dumplings.  Oh, good God.  Come on.  How many calories?  In total, so far?  Oh, that is simply just 11-  That's 1,163 calories.  Ah, for just those.  For just 100 grams of fat.  But in the total breakfast so far, and there's still a decent amount of video here left,  they've made 14,000 calories worth of breakfast.  Yeah, but how many guys are eating that?  Uh, I don't think it's that many. 
[01:36:00]  I want my sausages.  I want my sausages.  My sausages.  So, E-Rock, you're back on the diet today?  Uh, yeah.  What have you eaten so far today?  Uh, so far I've had a, um, sugar-free iced tea and a, uh, one of those weight loss shakes.  That's it.  Okay.  Just drink water.  You don't need the sugar-free.  Yeah, he, E-Rock has the, this is, he cannot drink water.  Stop not giving yourself, stop giving yourself sweet treats.  No, I can drink water.  You gotta drink water.  Water sucks. 
[01:36:30]  But I'm trying, I've been trying to wean off soda for the longest time.  Oh, my love.  He always puts powders in his water.  You always put powders in.  Every time you drink water, you put some kind of powder in it.  Yeah, that's not good.  Licton's iced tea.  That's, that's, that's, that's cancer shit.  Aspartame.  It's hard to not drink aspartame, man.  Cancer shit, brother.  Cancer shit.  Just have water.  Just tell yourself no.  Jessica Ventura's looking into that.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  He's looking into the powders.  It's a conspiracy.  That's all you gotta say.  What happens after, so for two weeks, no bread, no fruit. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, and after two weeks, you can reintroduce it back into your diet.  I don't know, it's some kind of resetting, cleansing thing.  I don't know what it, and then it's mostly, you can do meat and chicken and vegetables and  things like that.  I'll be investigating.  They're putting things in the water.  Crystal light, ice tea mix, Kool-Aid.  Delicious.  This man didn't want himself seen on camera, so we'll just go to silhouette. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, it's E-Rock.  He's back on the diet.  So one little slip.  You're back on.  That's good.  You slipped off the wagon.  A little pepperoni pizza.  Actually, the wheels fell off of it.  You slipped on the bacon.  The axles broke.  You slipped on the bacon grease.  A lot more swings in the new year.  That's it. 
[01:38:00]  You know what?  Take more swings, you hit more.  That's how it works.  They're calling it the South Beef Diet.  You can have beef.  You can have beef.  Can you have one of those steak martinis?  Oh, look.  He just groaned all steak martinis.  It's delicious.  I told Jess we need steak martinis at our wedding just so I can count how many E-Rock eats.  When is your wedding, Sam?  It won't be until like summer of 2012. 
[01:38:30]  You know how fast that's going to be?  If we're still here.  Oh, shit.  We will be.  You know how fast that'll go?  Yeah.  From now until that date when you're standing up there going like, holy fuck, I'm getting married.  It's going to seem like two seconds.  It's going to be a nice day, though.  I don't doubt it.  For you, you're the one, you know, winning in this.  Yeah.  She's going to be the Anthony crying the night of the wedding.  Yeah.  What did I do? 
[01:39:00]  What did I do?  I suck.  It's fucking blows.  I could have done so much better.  Oh, well, that's a personal attack.  That's mean.  E-Rock's happy.  Anyway, back to this.  They look good.  Oh, my God.  These guys digging into it.  Bacon bread.  That doesn't even look good.  It doesn't.  That looks a little rough.  They made, here's what they did, too.  They basket weave together bacon and then cook it, and it becomes like a wrap. 
[01:39:30]  So they then use this bacon basket weave square thing that's cooked as a wrap, and then they  wrap other really healthy stuff in it.  What they just did there, that was the first part of this video, it shows them they make  candied bacon.  They candy bacon.  These guys are awesome.  They're awesome.  They really are awesome.  It probably is very good.  You know what we should do?  Make love?  Well, we're going to do that a little later. 
[01:40:00]  We should take a break, though, because it's just always a free break.  We have to suck dicks.  We've got to make love.  We've got to fuck each other in the ass.  Jimmy spends all morning hoping.  Yes.  Throwing out little hopes.  All right.  Why don't we take a break so we can get Matt LeBlanc in here?  I think he's going to be here any moment, so we should break now so we're not in a weird.  We've got to keep going with the show.  So when we get back, we should have Matt LeBlanc from his new show on Showtime called Episodes, 
[01:40:30]  which we've all seen and we've all enjoyed.  So stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Great cover, right? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  You're talking about good covers, so great covers.  Disturbed doing Atlantic Confusion, the old Genesis song.  I was noticing that, what's his name?  Genesis.  Phil Collins?  Mine just went on me.  Yeah, Phil Collins.  He looks now like his puppet looked in this video. 
[01:41:30]  Doesn't he look just like the puppet?  That's a very good observation.  There we go.  Matt LeBlanc.  How are you, sir?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Before you ask, yeah, we're on the air.  Yeah, we're on the air.  People always sit down and go, are we on the air?  After like five minutes of just yapping, we're actually on the air.  And I want to start by saying this.  We've all seen the new show and we like it.  We got to.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we got the advanced copies and we actually did our homework and watched the show. 
[01:42:00]  Well, good.  That's better than that.  But you don't understand.  We usually don't do that.  It stinks.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't stink at all, sir.  No, it's very cool.  Well, I love the good inside look at the bullshit that goes on in Hollywood.  We deal with some of that same bullshit in radio, which is different.  Well, but it's such a lower rung.  Don't even try.  Yeah, I guess we can't.  Why relate to one of the biggest fucking sitcom stars ever?  Yeah, we're kind of like you, except for the money and fame stuff.  The characters in that show, the L.A. casting people. 
[01:42:30]  What are you doing?  I have sweatpants because I'm flying today.  Okay.  So I always travel with sweatpants.  Jimmy's a big star.  He's doing a lot.  I'm shooting something for him this weekend and I go out Monday, but I fly from here to  Phoenix and I always wear sweatpants when I fly.  Why is that?  More comfortable.  Actually, I'm weird because I piss so much that when I fly, I always put my hands.  You asked, Matt.  Yes.  I put my hands where my waistband is so it's not pressing down on my stomach because when  I wear a belt when I fly, I've been in the bathroom every two seconds. 
[01:43:00]  So it actually makes me pee less.  Really?  Yeah, not on my balls, just on my leg.  You have to go all the time?  I'm the worst.  Yeah, believe me.  Patrice told me I should be checked for diabetes.  Have you been?  Yes, I'm fine.  Well, then why do you pee a lot?  I don't know.  But that is why I wear sweatpants when I fly.  You don't wear sweatpants, Matt?  No, but I want to hang out with you more.  Believe me, Jimmy is fun to hang with.  You would really have a good time with Jimmy.  The people in the L.A.  We haven't even named the show.  It's episode time. 
[01:43:30]  It's on Showtime.  It's actually this Sunday, 9.30.  Starts at 9.30, right?  Yep, this Sunday.  It's the best look at the way those behind-the-scenes people are.  I mean, they were really funny and repulsive.  I mean, they were really hateable and extremely accurate.  That was one of my favorite parts of the show, was just showing how awful the people in the network can be.  Well, I mean, obviously it's amplified a little bit, but it's an interesting look. 
[01:44:00]  Like, it's all the people that they've run into, the producers that are network people, all the people that are, you know, and they've sort of put everyone, mixed everyone together to come up with these kind of bizarro characters.  Are there people that you definitely went, oh, yeah, that is so-and-so from when we did Friends or whatever you were working on at the moment?  Was it like, yeah, this is that person?  No comment. 
[01:44:30]  I see it coming a mile away.  Perhaps. I don't know.  Could be.  I don't want to get assassinated.  I'm sure there were a few.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Yeah, it's...  In your words, Matt, I mean, how would you explain episodes?  It's a show about the making of a show.  That was really successful in Britain.  Yeah, it's a show that...  The show is really...  It's about this British couple who are a writer-producer team, and they have a hit show in England. 
[01:45:00]  And they are wooed by the American networks, one American network, to bring their show stateside and recreate it, and they're promised the world.  And one by one, every promise is broken, and they just take it in the shorts.  And then the show becomes completely different.  Yeah, and...  Completely, where he's now a hockey coach.  I think we can say that, right?  Yeah, it's about the head...  The show originally is about the headmaster of an elite boys' academy who's hopelessly in love with a middle-aged lesbian. 
[01:45:30]  And when they bring it to the States, the network wants to fire that guy, played by Richard Griffiths, and replace him with me.  So I play myself, Matt LeBlanc, or a version of myself.  I mean, it's not really a documentary.  It's this, like, scripted version of myself.  And since I'm not really old enough to play, or I don't look right to play the headmaster, we change it to coach, and then it becomes a hockey coach. 
[01:46:00]  And then the lesbian, we change her to be straight, so that there's room for something down the line, and just kind of meddle with their show, and water it down, and water it down, and water it down, and water it down, and water it down.  And the writer-producer team, you know, are not happy, obviously.  Yeah.  They took their little baby very seriously, and hate that it's being chopped apart and changed into something different.  And it's absolutely what happens, though. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, you've had to have seen that happen during your career.  Well, I mean, you know, it's sort of a play.  I mean, you know, there's a lot, like The Office and I think Shameless, another show that comes on right after us is actually based on a show that was a hit in London.  You know, it seems to be a trend.  Yeah, yeah.  A show coming from overseas, over here, getting remade and put back on the air.  But my show is really interesting.  The writing, I think, is really good.  It's really sharp and smart. 
[01:47:00]  It's David Crane and Jeffrey Clarick, and David was the head writer on Friends.  So, you know, he called me up and he said, hey, we have an idea.  And I said, oh, okay.  I was just, you know, sitting on the couch doing nothing.  So what the hell?  Why not?  I love how you are on the show, though, because it's like, you know, leading men in the show is always made out.  The obsession with likable, and they talk about likable, which is just a word you learn to hate.  And you do some things that make you, you're like a really complete person in the show. 
[01:47:30]  It's like there are times where you're like a really nice guy and compassionate, and they show the humanity of, you know, being divorced and all this stuff.  And then there's a couple things you do that are just scumbag moves.  And it's great.  It's like that's what a complete person is.  It's like they don't take away that part of your personality or of your character to make you more likable.  And it was also really fun to sort of take paw shots at myself, you know, make fun of the whole Friends fame.  It was fun. 
[01:48:00]  And I got to say, I don't know that I would have been so up for it had it not been in the hands of these two guys writing it.  You know, they were there for the whole Friends thing.  So it was like if I'm going to make fun of myself, I felt really in good hands with them doing it.  And it was really clever and sharp, and it was fun.  With that said, did you really have a cologne out?  No, we never had a cologne.  Okay.  Because that's part of some of the future episodes down the line where he makes fun of a cologne that he had out. 
[01:48:30]  That was one of my favorite lines in the thing where I think the woman goes, yeah, well, catchphrase is kind of like, yeah.  And you're like, yeah, well, tell it to my house in Malibu.  And it's like it really is easy to shit on something, but it's like, you know.  Right.  It bought me a house.  One of the most successful shows of all time.  And when you come off a show like of that magnitude, which is one of the biggest ever, what is the process you go through?  Like, okay, I want to take a little bit of time off, or I want to get right back into it, or I'm only going to be seen as this guy?  I mean, well, for me, I went straight into doing Joey for two years, and, you know, that was less than spectacular experience. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, it was actually really interesting because we had the same stage, same crew, and it just wasn't, the writing wasn't there.  Do you think people missed the other characters?  I don't know if it was that.  I think it just, you know, the stories we told on Joey were, I think, maybe in the wrong direction. 
[01:49:30]  You know, I think one thing that hampered the show was to have the nephew, to saddle Joey with a nephew so that he had to be a role model,  really sort of handcuffed the character because I wanted to see Joey in L.A., you know, at the Playboy Mansion or drinking a beer on the Hollywood sign or going out,  all this fun stuff he wanted to see. 
[01:50:00]  And because he had to be a role model and set an example for his nephew, it kind of handcuffed the character in a way.  You must love the fact, though, that with this show you're able to break away from that kind of role models, squeaky clean kind of.  Yeah, it's not the sort of network.  I'm not selling, you know, cars and diapers anymore.  You know, swearing and talking about lesbians. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I mean, because obviously you've got to be afraid.  It's the double-edged sword thing with being on a hit show like that.  The typecasting, the thing, oh, people will just say this or, you know, they'll say, here's this character and that's who we'll always be.  So it must be nice to break out of that.  Yeah, sure.  I mean, you know, typecasting, if you really want to get to the bottom of it, look, everybody's just like a squirrel trying to get a nut, trying to make money. 
[01:51:00]  If you can make money in this world, you make money in this world.  Whether it's typecast or not, who really gives a shit, you know what I mean?  So I don't really have that big of a problem with it.  No, see, that's good.  Yeah, Spock had a problem with it a few years ago.  But this is great, though.  Yeah, he wrote a book called I Am Not Spock.  It's like, shut up, yes, you are.  I know, we'll get one fucking thing solved in search of it and we won't think of you in Spock.  What a cocktease that show was.  Really, the biggest questions ever and they had less answers than I did when I was 11.  Like Monster Quest is the new one like that. 
[01:51:30]  Have you seen that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like all the Loch Ness monsters.  They never find Bigfoot.  Bigfoot's never there.  The whole show is in the commercial for each episode.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, I'm going to watch it.  It sounds like they found Bigfoot this week.  I think they found him.  All those dumb ghost hunter shows and they show people, go, what's that?  And it's the night vision camera.  And then if you ever watch the show, you realize the guy's like, what's that?  It's me.  Okay.  So there's nothing going on there.  They've all been there hoaxes.  The Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, that famous photo of Nessie coming out of the water was like the surgeon's photo. 
[01:52:00]  It was hoaxed.  They're all hoaxes.  Every one of them.  What did you think?  There was a real monster?  I don't know.  A lot of people saw it.  Of course they did.  You like to think.  Yeah, you dream.  You look forward to it.  Maybe there's something in there.  How great was it to, some of the lines in this were so.  Can we talk about our favorite scene?  Because it's in the first episode, I believe.  Where the English guy had a freaking audition for his own part.  That's an amazing scene.  It's extraordinarily uncomfortable. 
[01:52:30]  Because you're watching these people watch this great actor humiliating themselves.  That's part of the big hit when it was in Europe.  Yeah.  So your favorite scene is one that I'm not in.  Just laugh.  I can talk about it a few.  That's wonderful.  I said one of them.  Or did I say fan?  I'll be honest.  I said your favorite, I'm fucked.  The best scene ever.  Ever, ever, ever, ever done?  I think it was ever filmed.  Ever filmed.  Exactly.  I think it was very politically incorrect, too.  Like, the show really did some fucking impolite stuff, which was great. 
[01:53:00]  And I won't say what episode it was or what happens, but there's one scene where they're  at a benefit for rape victims.  And some of the dialogue in that and the way you're just fucking, you're yapping while  she's talking up there about her rape and he's fucking talking and popping a wine bottle.  It's a rape benefit.  It's a benefit for rape with a wine tasting involved.  That alone is just killing.  A little tacky.  And they got a gift bag after the thing. 
[01:53:30]  And what was in it again?  A bottle of Merlot, a corkscrew, and a rape.  Yeah.  So, you know, they're not being politically correct.  And they can never be accused of making fun of rape at all.  But it's like, just the context of it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  The opening, like, they're all sitting at the table and Matt's there with the, there's  the bottle in front of him.  And you just hear the woman go, and he struck me with a piece of pipe.  And then he just starts talking to his friends and fucking popping.  It's so great. 
[01:54:00]  Can't wait to open up his bottle of wine.  See?  The pilot was that I want.  Yeah.  You're saying what a shitty actress she wants?  Not a good actor.  I think she does voiceovers for, like, cartoons and shit.  That's hysterical.  It was such a, like, a genuine, uncomfortable thing to watch.  How could anybody discuss this while she's talking about a rape?  It's funny, because when we were shooting that scene, we pitched a lot of different  jokes for the, you know, it was funny things come in threes, right?  So it was, I did a pilot with her once. 
[01:54:30]  Not a good actress.  I think she does voiceover now for cartoons and shit.  But that third line, we pitched all different kinds of stuff.  Some probably didn't squeak through.  All of them.  A little too raunchy.  Yeah.  Even for showtime.  Stairs and practices were like, you know, we don't have advertisers, but.  Yeah.  We still want to stay on the air.  Yeah, we still read emails and letters from people who give us death threats.  You have to be very happy with the way this came out.  I mean, I really, I had some genuine fucking out loud laughs alone, which is really hard to 
[01:55:00]  do when you're watching six, seven episodes in a row.  Well, thanks.  Yeah.  And you know, I am really proud of it.  There's seven episodes and it really builds to a nice finale at the end.  Absolutely.  I don't know if you guys have seen it.  Yeah.  Oh, right to the end.  Yeah.  Can I tell everyone what happened?  No.  I wouldn't do that.  No?  Because it's so good.  I just got to tell people.  I hope you got to be an uncomfortable guy.  But it's nice how, you know, you have these three characters that are, and you sort of 
[01:55:30]  watch, you watch their marriage kind of go downhill.  And it's like, it's about this couple that are at that age where they should be having  kids, but they don't have kids.  So the show is like their baby, their show in England, and they bring it here and their  child is in jeopardy.  And I come in and I sort of represent the, if you will, the big evil world that presents  danger to their child and kind of, you know, sneak my way, put their child in danger. 
[01:56:00]  And at the end, it really is, you find yourself kind of caring about these characters that you  think, oh, wait, I don't care about these people.  Well, I guess I do.  Yeah.  I kind of do.  When did that happen?  You know, and it kind of sneaks up on you.  I was surprised where it went.  I'll just say that.  I was very surprised with certain things that happened as the episodes went on.  I was like, wow, you think they're not going to do something because, again, it makes him  less likable or it makes someone less likable. 
[01:56:30]  I was very happy that it went where it went.  I'll tell you this much.  The last scene, so uncomfortable and so funny at the same time.  So there you go.  The opening scene, it was fucking perfect, though, man.  But the minute he walks in.  I want to say it's so bad, but it sets up for a second season, that's for sure.  Yeah.  The minute he walks in, it's every humiliation every one of us have ever had with a celebrity.  It's like they're all expecting this big, the network is like, wow, Matt's dying. 
[01:57:00]  He loves the project.  And so he walks in.  He's on his cell phone talking to these people who are building him a restaurant.  And he's like, so I'm here.  Why?  And you just realize they have to pitch him the show and they don't want to pitch him  the show.  And it's every embarrassment every one of us have ever felt about being around a celebrity.  Yeah.  There's a great joke in that scene, too, because they were told that I saw their show while  I was in London shooting a movie.  And so they say, did you just do a movie in London?  And I say, no. 
[01:57:30]  And they say, so you're not a big fan?  And I go, of London?  Eh.  No, no, of us.  Oh, you guys.  No.  But then don't you start shitting on the show and comparing it with something and making  some comparison to another show that they hate?  It's a really uncomfortable, unpleasant exchange.  But right out of the gate, you fucking come off as really unpleasant, which hooked me in  to wanting to watch the show.  It's like he's not being the adorable, fun movie star guy.  Yeah.  I like that aspect of it, too.  Right out of the gate, it's like, oh, he's kind of an asshole. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  How much have they offered you guys for a reunion show, friends?  You know, I have no idea.  Has anyone come through?  The rumor's been going around for a while now, and I can tell you right now that I spoke  directly to David Crane about it, and I don't, it's not happening.  It's not happening.  It's not happening.  It never was happening.  I don't know where that rumor came from, but it's not happening.  You bump into each other every so often?  If it is happening, it's happening without me, and I'll be fucking pissed. 
[01:58:30]  You'll be the guy on the phone.  It's like, hey, everyone, it's Joey.  He's calling.  From Paris.  Isn't it always Paris?  It's somewhere where they can't have a camera.  Right.  It's terrible.  Did you see, we also love the comeback that Lisa Kudrow did, the comeback.  Do you see those episodes or any of it?  I did.  I did see that.  It's great, right?  For me, that was hard to watch because Lisa's like a, you know, we were all like brothers 
[01:59:00]  and sisters.  You know, we all really cared about each other.  And to watch her play a character who never won.  Right.  That was extremely uncomfortable.  She never scored.  I wanted to see every episode.  I wanted to see her score.  She's great in it, and I thought it was a really well-done show, and she played the part  beautifully.  But I was so rooted for her to win, and it was really hard.  And, you know, it's hard when you know someone to watch them do something, and you know what  I mean?  I care so much about her.  It was really hard for me to watch that show.  There was so many humiliations.  It was a good testament to how good the show was, you know, because I bought it. 
[01:59:30]  I bought it full bore.  I never met her, and it was hard to watch.  It was just this nice woman trying so hard to be liked and succeed, and all these little  things in your home cringing.  Any time a show can make you go like, oh, fuck.  Did you feel that way watching David Schwimmer and Band of Brothers?  He was good at that.  No, no, I mean, he was good at that, but it was like, he was just such an ass in it.  And you're like, oh, this is painful.  You know, he's an asshole. 
[02:00:00]  I'm having dinner with him tonight, so I hope he's listening.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You still do, like, bump into those guys and hang out every so often?  Yeah, I've actually seen Schwimmer quite a bit lately.  He's married now, and he's having a baby, and he's a good guy.  He's directing.  He's doing good.  Matthew's got a new show.  You just laugh and throw hundreds around.  Thousands.  Thousands.  What am I talking about?  Look at me.  Is it hard when you guys are all on the show together, and you see, like, you know, Jennifer 
[02:00:30]  Addison doing a movie or somebody else doing something?  A movie?  How about 10 a year?  I'm saying, like, every time it comes up, do you ever feel like, you're like, is there  any, it's hard to watch that?  Because I see people with things I've done moving on to something else, and there's a  slight bit of, yeah.  Jealousy?  Not even, not even jealousy, because I'm sure it's like, wow, she's got to get up early  and go do radio interviews for that while I'm laying in bed going, yeah.  So you don't feel any, like, desire to be a part? 
[02:01:00]  I'm happy for her.  Yeah, no, no, it's not a race.  I don't, I'm never, I don't look at it like that.  It was never, you know, a competition, in my opinion, between any of us.  And God bless her, God bless, you know, anyone that can work as much as they want to, you  know?  Yeah.  It doesn't bother me.  Yeah, and it's never a feeling of, like, bad for the other person, but sometimes it's  just like, oh, man, I feel like I'm, I just feel like I'm getting left behind, and I feel  like that a lot.  But again, I was not, I was not on one of the biggest shows in history, either. 
[02:01:30]  I guess it's a little bit different when you've got that resume.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, I don't, I don't feel that way at all.  You should talk to a shrink or something.  Oh, I do.  Oh, he does.  Once a week.  He does.  I think she's technically a social worker.  She's lovely.  We're getting to the bottom of a lot of things.  Oh, are you?  Why do I lose my erections if there's no shame?  You know, things like that.  Sure, sure. 
[02:02:00]  Do you, was there certain personality traits or whatever?  There's one trait in there that you, that you have as a character, which is very funny,  and it's what every guy would give himself.  Yeah.  I had nothing to do with it.  You know, you didn't, you didn't pitch that in the writer's meeting.  They called me, they called me up and they said, we want to give you a huge dick in the  show.  And I said, all right.  What are you going to say to that?  Yeah.  Who's going to argue that one?  No, no, no, no.  Make me hung like a field mouse.  You don't want to, you don't want to have that false advertising thing though, where it 
[02:02:30]  gets talked up too much.  And then in real life, you're kind of like, ah.  Yeah.  Look, for the record, I'm a completely normal proportion guy.  See, there you go.  And it's got a huge hog.  No, see, that's, that's what people say.  That's bad.  That's been bad for you?  No, it hasn't been bad.  Believe me.  But no, it's just one of those things that it's like, you don't want the expectation to  be so much that the reality isn't, you know, doesn't live up to the, uh, but you remember 
[02:03:00]  you got to put in the extra work, you know, mine's big enough.  It gets me off every time.  It gets me off every time.  She's shaking her head in the corner.  Slow down.  Slow down.  That's great.  Right.  No, it's, but you always remember that stuff.  When you hear rumors about a guy's hog, like I've heard, uh, James Woods, Chaplin, you  remember that stuff?  I heard Leno too.  Yeah.  I heard he's packing a monster.  And every time I see him, that's all I think of.  I just want to ask him. 
[02:03:30]  No.  Yeah.  Did you hear that?  Milton Berle.  Milton Berle.  Howard, did you hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh man.  Yeah.  That was obviously years ago.  I'll pull out just enough to beat you.  Just enough to beat you.  That's a great line, man.  I was driving to work.  I had to pull over.  That's a great line, man.  That was one of the funniest things I've ever heard.  That's a great line.  Just enough to beat you.  Especially from such a little twerp like Milton Berle.  Like you would never expect it from this little, you know, vaudeville type comic.  There's nothing I'd expect to have.  But he didn't want to talk about it.  He kept, Howard kept badging and badging.  He was like, no, I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it. 
[02:04:00]  Finally.  Forrest Tucker was supposed to have a big one, too.  Who's Forrest Tucker?  Who's the guy from F Troop?  The other guy.  The straight man.  Oh, I don't know who that is.  Oh, sorry.  You're going back into obscure people.  I heard the guy that produced The Honeymooners.  Let's enjoy it.  Were there any scenes that you wanted to do for this?  Like, I know you said there were certain jokes you wanted to do.  Were there any scenes that you wanted to do that they're like, eh, that's going to hurt you on the show.  That's going to make people not like you. 
[02:04:30]  Did they throw any of that likability stuff at you or no?  No, you know, I've got to say, in terms of showrunners, we've got two really, really, really smart guys.  David and Jeffrey really crafted the thing very well.  You know, there would be certain pitches.  I would pitch jokes here and there, and sometimes they would get in, and sometimes they wouldn't.  But for the most part, it was them writing the whole thing, and it was really their doing.  And everyone felt like we were in really good hands. 
[02:05:00]  It's got to be nice to be in a place where you can just kind of, you can kind of, at this place in your career.  Well, also, you know, I had this, like, relationship with David.  I worked for him for 10 years.  Right.  So, and that show was fairly successful.  You know what I mean?  So, when he has an idea, you kind of, you tend not to second-guess it.  So, it's really nice to be involved with something where you have this blind faith,  and you know you're in good hands, and he gives you a note and says,  try it a little more this way, and you don't then go in your own head and go, 
[02:05:30]  well, if I do do it that way, do I need to worry about it?  You don't have any of that.  There's no inner monologue going on.  You just commit and go for it.  What do you do when that does happen, though, when you're working for somebody,  and you're just kind of like, oh, God, I can do this better?  You second-guess it, and you kind of go, is that really the best way to do it?  And then it fucks with your head.  You know, you get in your head, and you...  Do you try to diplomatically say, like, I think I could do this this way?  Well, they still, you know, they'll say, well, just try one that way. 
[02:06:00]  And you say, all right, yeah, we'll try one.  And that's the one that ends up in the movie.  Well, for safety.  I like the one for safety.  It's the best one.  All right, no, that was all good.  We're just going to do it one more time.  Do it how it's written, please.  Oh, this is the one that you're going to use, because, yeah, the other ones were good.  Some of the best direction I ever got, I was doing an episode of Louie's show, and I did a line.  He goes, all right, I want your motivation to be something other than it's just your next line to say.  Oh, really?  I didn't even talk to you like that, which is hysterical. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, he fucking clubbed me good.  I deserved it.  Is it just waiting for your next line?  Yeah.  You're staring at the person waiting for your cue?  Yeah, I think it was actually one thing he would do during, and fuck Louie,  one thing he would do during Lucky Louie's, he would actually move his lips at times when somebody else was talking.  No, I've seen that on shows.  I don't know if you could catch it.  We would catch it in rehearsal once in a while, because he wrote all of it.  I used to do that.  I'm notorious for that.  Really?  Mouthing other people's lines?  I know.  You know what?  In the process of learning my lines, I learn everybody's lines.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  So Jennifer Aniston used to get on me all the time. 
[02:07:00]  She used to go, Matty, Jesus Christ, you've got to stop.  What are you doing?  You're saying my lines as I'm saying them.  Am I really?  I wasn't aware of them.  Yeah.  Lips moving.  Sorry, you've got to stop.  Sorry.  People notice that at home.  They'll look for that now.  Are you a better first take guy, or are you one of those guys?  Like Brando used to have cards all over the place, so he wouldn't know the lines.  Or are you like three or four takes in is when you start to do greats?  I think first take.  Really?  Yeah.  Ed Wood.  Nice.  What's your greatest fear as an actor?  I mean, for me, this is so stupid. 
[02:07:30]  I always have trouble acting when I'm standing.  I always tell actors this, but I don't know what to do with my hands when I act.  I really don't.  They're torture.  I either over-gesticulate like that and look stupid, or I just...  Stiff.  Or stiff.  Stiff arm.  Like, what's a hard scene for you to do, or something that you, like, historically have  had trouble with?  You know, that's a good question.  A lot of people say comedy's really hard.  For me, comedy's easy.  The thing that's hard for me is, like, if it's something, you know, as an actor, you use 
[02:08:00]  emotional memory, like, if you need to be really upset, so you imagine, like, your mom  dying or something.  Whenever I have to sort of substitute something in my own life to get emotionally to a place  I need to be...  That's really hard for me, because I don't like to, you know, I don't like to...  Like, to reg up things.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I don't want to think about that.  Or, yeah, my dog died when I was a kid.  You gotta be sad.  You know what I mean?  It's like, fuck that.  Let's tell jokes.  Is that like method acting, though? 
[02:08:30]  Would you consider yourself more of a method actor?  Is that what that is?  Where you kind of get into...  I guess that's...  You know, for me, acting is just...  You just pretend.  Make believe.  Yeah.  It's like a license to not ever have to grow up.  Just make believe.  Make believe you're getting shot.  Make believe you're falling off the building.  Make believe you're in love.  Make believe you hate that person.  Right?  Yeah.  It's all fake.  Great gig.  Yeah, they always tell me, make believe you can act.  I just fucking mumble through it.  Make believe you're good at it. 
[02:09:00]  We're being told Matt's gotta get out of here.  He's a really busy gig.  He's a busy man.  But we loved it, man.  Showtime.  Well, thanks, you guys.  Episodes premieres this Sunday at 9.30 on Showtime.  Yeah, check it out.  Very funny, man.  And it's a great story.  It's got a great story arc.  And I suggest it highly.  I had some tremendous laughs in this.  I wouldn't say it if I didn't like it, but I wouldn't lie to you and tell you it was great.  Because it comes off at the end of watching all seven, you're left with this feeling of like, it's smart, it's funny, and it's like really racy and raunchy and stuff. 
[02:09:30]  But there's not one piece of nudity in it, if you think about it.  There's not one.  Well, we'd like to see the blonde's tits.  Sure.  Let's be honest with you.  Well, you see a little of the top.  A little bit.  You see nothing.  Well, in the porno video that she shot.  Oh, that's right.  That was shot perfectly.  She brought that in from home.  She just brought it in.  Thanks a lot, Matt.  Matt LeBlanc, everyone.  Thanks, you guys.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:10:00]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  One man comes on a barbed wire fence.  One man he resists.  One man washed on an empty beach.  One man betrayed with a kiss.  In the name of love. 
[02:10:30]  One more in the name of love.  In the name of love.  Oh, yeah.  This was the cover I was talking about.  I guess it's not that good.  Dirks.  Oh, is it?  Dirks Bentley.  Something like that.  Dirks.  Dirks.  What do you think of the Friends guy?  Huh?  Matt LeBlanc?  Thumbs up, right?  Matt LeBlanc.  He's a big star. 
[02:11:00]  A big star.  We don't get a lot of big stars on our show.  We got another big star walking down the hallway.  Patton Oswalt.  There he is.  He is walking down the hall, isn't he?  He's taking his sweet old time.  I'm so happy.  What is this star-studded show?  Look at Roland.  He's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's.  Bring him right in, Roland.  Roland.  Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  Patton.  Come on in, Patton.  Yeah, you might as well come right in. 
[02:11:30]  Very funny guy, Patton Oswalt.  Who's playing, uh, where are we playing?  Caroline's?  Yeah.  Caroline's this weekend.  Two shows Friday.  Two shows Saturday.  Caroline's.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  First time on our show.  It's about time.  We've been trying to get you on this show for fucking ever.  Yeah.  Been a while.  Dude, I gotta tell you.  Why did that never happen?  Well, you, uh, you, you, you were in the movie Big Fan.  Right.  And I was a big fan of Big Fan.  You saw it?  Oh, thanks.  And I said.  We're going to see that.  But, but I said, let's get this guy on. 
[02:12:00]  I loved it.  Not a lot of people saw it.  It was like kind of an independent type of thing.  Oh, that thing, that thing, like it toured the country like a little band in a, in, in  a van.  Like it would play a week somewhere and then vanish.  Yeah.  Show up somewhere else.  There was no actual, I felt like, do the, do I have, I have one print of this movie?  Are we just driving it to theaters and, you know, like going flyering the town and all  right, we'll see you tonight for the screening.  Was it your baby or, or you were just, uh, called to, to play the main role there?  I was called to play the main role. 
[02:12:30]  The guy that wrote it was the, uh, uh, he, he wrote, uh, he wrote the wrestler.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then, so he was getting offers right out of the stuff and he's like, nah, put my money  in this thing.  I want to do this.  We're talking about Big Fan.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It was great.  I really liked the film cause you were such a creep.  A caller to a sports talk show.  That was very obsessed.  That must've been seen like a lot of your callers all just kind of gelled into one person  on the screen.  Oh, please. 
[02:13:00]  My callers stink.  And then who was in the movie is, uh, Scott Farrell.  Yeah.  He was the voice.  Our old pal Scott Farrell was, uh, the sports guy.  I'm no kidding.  Then he called, you don't really.  Is he a real, I don't listen to sports, is he a real sports guy?  Oh yeah.  Oh.  So he deals with those people then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you would, you would, uh, get in the movie, you would get everything you want to  say on a piece of paper.  It was almost serial killer ish.  Well, you had to have a perfect call to make sure you're still like the number one caller. 
[02:13:30]  Perfect call.  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  To be the number one caller for this particular sports talk show.  You guys must get calls where it's, you, you figure out halfway through that.  Oh, this guy wrote all this down.  But he's clearly reading a little manifesto if people wrote something down.  We get people that don't even know they're on the air.  Like, what?  Huh?  What are you guys doing?  Yeah.  You're on the air.  You know, say what you want to say.  Me?  Yes, you.  But they learn from us because we don't write anything. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  That's true.  Why are we expecting more from that?  True.  Apparently the guy that wrote Big Fan said he would listen to sports radio and hear these  callers, and the minute they would hang up in his mind, he would go, okay, what's that  guy doing right now?  Like, now that his call is done, how does he fill the next 23 hours and 57 minutes?  Right.  What does he do?  And then that's where the movie came out.  Yeah, because you can't really call more than once usually.  Yeah.  It really is interesting, too, because I used to listen when we were off the air for a  couple of years.  I would ride around, look at prostitutes, and listen to Beningo at night. 
[02:14:30]  That's what I would do.  Hours of sports radio just to forget that I wasn't on radio anymore.  Yeah.  And the same people night after night.  Night after 3 o'clock in the morning, and they're calling up making these fucking,  who gives a shit points about, yeah, the Mets, you know, the middle of relief.  All right, thanks for the call.  It's like, why would you give a fuck?  Meanwhile, those prostitutes, same bald guy in the car every night.  I come down here, I'm right down here, and the same guy, it's really weird, man.  And I think he's got the windows, and he's clearly listening to something in there. 
[02:15:00]  I don't know what, just come out and say hi to me.  Just stare, and it's really weird.  What a creep.  I could write a movie about that guy.  Jimmy's best story about it.  That's a great point.  You've got to tell Patton.  We've told it on the air a few times, but your best prostitution story is when they took your glasses.  It wasn't they.  I was looking at trannies.  What?  It wasn't they.  You've got to tell Patton.  He, no she.  Respect.  It's such an amazing story.  I was right around looking at trannies, and I was looking at one, and I wasn't going to buy it.  I just kept stopping. 
[02:15:30]  I was wearing glasses back then, because I had an eye infection.  Right.  Many years ago, I was living in Jersey.  And I stopped, and the tranny walked over and snatched my glasses off, and said, for wasting  my time, and walked away.  And I'm literally sitting there in my car, and I can see maybe from here to open.  I am completely fucking blind.  Wow.  And a cop was riding by, and I actually high-beamed and flashed the cop.  And I'm like, and he came over, and I'm like, she took my glasses.  And he's like, what the fuck are you doing here?  That's a guy.  And I had to pretend I didn't know.  I'm like, really?  Oh, see, I didn't have my glasses on. 
[02:16:00]  Did you, like, affect a Kansas accent?  I'm just visiting this city, and this real tall woman come up with big forearms, grab  my specks off my face.  I was just going to ask for directions.  Yeah.  I think the Jersey plates gave it away.  Oh, wow.  So, you can literally say, a hooker took my glasses.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I can certainly say that.  So, you basically, you never have gotten off the playground.  They're either taking your lunch money or your glasses.  It just never ends. 
[02:16:30]  My dignity, my no herpes status.  Sorry, they took my lunch money, my no herpes status.  These bullies are really rough.  You are being bullied.  I had a hooker pop my fucking, take my key out of my ignition one time.  We were stopped.  How did you let them reach into the car this far?  She was in the car.  Oh, she was in the, oh, wow.  Jesus, Anthony.  Silly me.  I assumed.  Every once in a while, he would invite one inside.  Fight one inside.  No, I was giving her a ride.  Like, I would give them a ride. 
[02:17:00]  This was before I was really dating a lot in New York and getting whores.  I was giving her a ride.  And I would see if I could finagle anything.  And this one, I was like, ah, I'm just giving you a ride.  And we stopped at the stop side.  You know, Margaret Place in Bangladesh.  And fucking popped out my keys.  Did you got to give me 20?  You know, Jim, when they say they want to listen to Delilah, change the state.  Let them listen.  They get their very insistent on the right music.  You know, it's got to be Peebo Bryson if I'm going to go down on you.  I can't do it to this old 70s metal.  The mood's not right.  Yeah, hookers never like Sabbath.  I learned that. 
[02:17:30]  Hookers don't like Sabbath.  There's your next book title.  Hookers don't like Sabbath.  Scares them away.  You got the keys taken away.  And then what did you do?  You had to give 20.  Did you get anything besides the keys?  No, I might have got to see the tits or something.  I mean, and I want...  And the hairs on them?  Yeah, you have to...  Well, you know...  It was dark.  Razor stubble.  Yeah, you know.  No, that's bad, man.  Oh, they smell like Nair.  I like it.  Very nice. 
[02:18:00]  So you bought your keys back.  I really did.  But you learn, if you don't do that, there's going to be a problem.  It's like, you have to...  I got to ask you, why did you invite this female, male, woman thing?  Oh, this was a woman.  Oh, sure.  Sure, sure.  Into the car.  To drop her off somewhere.  Sometimes I would just talk to them and get a feel.  Like one girl I used to drop off in Jersey.  I told this story and confessing it in Montreal.  And I wound up...  I really did not know she was a tranny.  I fucked her in the ass. 
[02:18:30]  And then I realized when I was fucking her, there's no bag, no nothing.  Jersey City.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  This is many, many...  This is late 90s at some point.  Let's play Russian roulette with an automatic.  Yeah.  Yeah, you had just seen The Phantom Menace.  You're in a good mood.  Late 90s.  You come out.  Jim, no offense.  Your life is taxi driver without the guns or push-ups.  You realize that, right?  Like, that's basically your life. 
[02:19:00]  That's fucking bad.  Yeah, it's like someone either adds some pull-ups and a massacre and you're just Travis Bickle,  basically.  Yeah, at least that would be something heroic.  Yeah, I just had the lonely part.  This is just sad.  Yeah, that guy Travis Bickle.  You heard of that Jim Norton guy?  How did you discover that he had a penis?  I was...  Because you swear that you didn't know at first.  No, I really didn't.  We were fucking...  I would tell you if I did.  We were fucking and I think it was on the...  Like, I was kneeling between the legs.  It was dark.  It was pitch black in my car in Jersey City. 
[02:19:30]  In a project, like next to a dumpster.  Wow.  And I just looked down.  Were you just trying to take every risk possible?  Okay.  I had something.  AIDS, robbery, murder.  Please just give me something.  Right.  They're going to name something after me.  Jim's Law.  Wait, stack them up.  Hey, what happened to that guy?  He suddenly lost a lot of weight.  He got Norton.  It's really weird.  He went Norton, man.  You know what happens. 
[02:20:00]  These guys, they get...  Oh, it's really weird.  Very well.  Can you pile them all up again?  It was Jersey City.  That was Jersey City.  No bag.  No bag.  Pitch black.  Pitch dark.  Tranny.  Yeah.  I lived in North Brunswick at the time.  My parents, and I was driving...  Holy shit.  And I forget how it happened.  I think she just flagged me down and asked for a ride.  Like, a legit ride.  She said, I'm going back to Jersey.  It's all my Jersey place.  I wouldn't...  A little help.  Yeah.  A little help here.  Good ride.  Who's got a ride for an old showgirl?  Oh, good times. 
[02:20:30]  Wow.  There's no way I'd pick anybody up if they needed a ride.  What were you doing?  Come on now.  I'm looking for prostitutes.  Oh, okay.  I was looking at hookers.  What do you think I was doing?  It was three in the morning.  I lived with my mom and dad.  You seemed to window shop a lot.  Yeah, I did.  That's most of my addiction was just looking.  It was a weird ritual.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Ritualistic.  I would only pick them up if they got it on the right side.  Like, if they looked at it on the right side, I would stop.  It was like all these things to keep the ritual going and not act out on it.  Right side. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love that you managed to work obsessive-compulsive disorder into this horribly dangerous situation.  Again, I just can't...  I can't only think that the hookers started to talk about you like, oh, there's that right side guy.  Yeah, go over to the left.  Here comes...  Yeah, here comes the right side guy.  Don't go the other way.  You know how he is.  They do recognize you after a while, and at times they'll heckle you.  Like, they'll yell things.  I got yelled at, because literally I would never stop.  Heckled on the road by a tranny. 
[02:21:30]  Heckled by hookers, yeah.  Keep riding around.  Like, shit like that.  Like, they just get annoyed that you're riding around and not stopping.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's great.  So you're fucking this thing in the ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pitch black.  Very dangerous neighborhood.  And then you look down.  And then you look down.  What did...  It was just...  I knew.  I knew.  I was young.  I was an idiot.  I mean...  I love the absolute...  I knew.  Yeah, I just knew.  It's like, oh my God.  You have two tumors in each labia.  It's terrible. 
[02:22:00]  You should see a doctor.  But I literally was very naive about that at one point in my life.  For a long time, I would get whores.  I didn't...  Like, I remember a new bunch of cops told me, because I would always feel for tits.  And he's like, so they get implants.  I never occurred to me.  A cop was helping you out, though?  He's a buddy of mine.  Sober buddy.  I never realized that a fucking...  A guy would get tits.  It didn't occur to me.  I was getting hookers for a long time at that point.  I would always check.  So that's when you were just so sweet and innocent.  Yeah, that was before it all went wrong.  You really were, yeah.  Just like a tender dough in the woods. 
[02:22:30]  I remember one Puerto Rican chick got in my car and she was eating peanut brittle.  And it's like...  Who the fuck eats peanut brittle?  I swear to God.  Did she just, like, visit her grandma?  Why was she eating peanut brittle?  It was the worst ever.  And then she sucked my dick and it was in the whole...  That peanut smell.  Peanut brittle!  Never forget that as long as I live.  I was 22.  She still had strong teeth, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  She wasn't bad at all.  And that was how I knew she wasn't doing meth.  Right. 
[02:23:00]  Her teeth would fall out.  Yeah, she was enjoying peanut brittle.  She's bad on the peanut brittle.  All right, you're just a garden variety alcoholic.  Maybe she did that to let the clients know that strong teeth, all right, no meth.  All right, I got a pretty good shot with that one, the peanut brittle.  Weird as a hook or find peanut brittle.  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  It's crazy.  Yeah, she was sexy, too.  Except with that, she was good looking.  Fuck, that's hilarious.  Except for the peanut brittle.  Yeah, except for the fucking types.  And the weird, jagged bits of, you know, sugar that are horrible.  Sticky, molasses-y peanut brittle on your dick. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  That is awful.  That's disturbing.  People are like, I just butt-fucked Yogi Bear.  That's what I know right now.  She really took some chances.  I had a regular named Kim.  She was a black girl.  She was a real girl, too, because I had fucked her.  I remember one time she hung out my door.  Like, she made me open the door and she pissed.  And then she got back in and she had left with one of her shoes outside the car.  So she just lost her shoe because she stood outside to piss and she was so drunk.  She was an alcoholic.  She was a great girl.  That's the closest. 
[02:24:00]  And that's the closest.  She ended with, she was a great girl.  That's the closest you ever come to being in, like, a Cinderella story.  That is a Cinderella story.  He put the piss fucking shoe back on my foot.  Yeah.  And I turned back into a skank.  Whoever fits into this fucking, whoever fits into this fucking, whoever fits into this  kid.  It was Dudley Moore's shoe.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  You know what happened to some of these broads?  No.  Over the years? 
[02:24:30]  I remember one really affected me.  I used to go to these sober dances.  And after a sober dance, I would just act out because I'd be lonely.  And this one white, white.  How awful is a sober dance?  Yeah, you know.  Fuck the story you're about to tell.  It was, they were not good.  Little, little dull.  Those are two words that really don't come out.  They're totally fine by themselves.  You put them together.  Oh, my God.  Sober dance.  You should have been a sober stand around and just look at an empty floor.  Bunch of zilches.  Because everybody's inhibitions are all still there.  Yeah, yeah.  Because in order to dance, people have to drink a little bit, you know? 
[02:25:00]  But there's one girl I picked up.  She's like, why are you doing this?  You don't need to do this.  Wow.  And I think I just wound up talking to her, not even having sex with her.  She just didn't want to fuck you.  Of course she didn't.  Yeah.  She already had the money.  She's like, all right, I'll shrink this idiot for a couple of minutes.  Act concerned.  But you said you were affected by her?  Meaning, like, I was like, wow, maybe she's right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And someone wants to know if you kept fucking the guy after you found out.  Well, when I discovered that the lady was not quite the lady, I thought, it's like, 
[02:25:30]  what am I going to do, talk to her manager?  Yeah.  I fucking dumped my load.  At that point, what are you going to do?  Yeah, demand the boss.  Yeah.  Wow.  False advertising.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to see somebody about this.  A bait switch.  A fucking box cutter soaked in garlic.  Like it's Michael Douglas and falling down, he's going to start pointing at the burger  on the menu board.  Hey, where's your shop steward?  What's going on?  I want to talk to him.  He probably had one.  He's in the fucking welding union. 
[02:26:00]  There's some guy from the 409 in Jersey.  Dude, how did you, uh, there wasn't any hair, like you fucked it in the ass.  It was so dark.  We made out everything.  I really was done with that one.  Oh my God.  That's years ago, yeah.  What did it, what did it look like?  What was the closest?  It was a vague outline, I really just don't remember.  I mean, like, facially.  Black girl, um, attractive.  I mean, literally, I just did not know.  I mean, you're saying black, but, but here, I want to boil it down here.  You fucked a black man in his ass. 
[02:26:30]  Now, so, so did America.  It shouldn't hurt her, did it?  Hi-oh!  But like, he was really clearly like close shaved, clean shaven, no stubble.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I really didn't know.  I would tell you this many years later than I knew, I really didn't know until I saw  that and I was already in mid-fuck.  It's easy, but a lot of times people get fooled, man.  And I was a little more naive back then.  And that hooker turned out to be Danny Glover. 
[02:27:00]  Let's bring him in.  A little surprise for you, Jim.  Oh, the reunion.  I was researching a role.  You're a Caroline.  You've got to plug Patton's Caroline.  Absolutely.  I don't mean, probably don't even need to be plugged, but when are you there?  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  Oh, you just do it on the weekend?  Yeah, 212-757-4100.  Yeah, I'm sure Patton will sell it out.  And your book, dude, we got this book.  We didn't talk about it because we literally got it this morning.  Like, they didn't give us any advanced copy.  Oh, God's sakes.  Sorry about that.  That's okay.  Are you promoting the book? 
[02:27:30]  Has it been out for a while?  It came out Tuesday.  Oh, you're brand new.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I've got to tell you, your first book, The Tales of a Man-East-Rested Silks, that was actually â€“ that kind of hung heavy over this book because I remember when I read it, it was like, oh, this fucker wrote a book.  It wasn't â€“ you didn't transcribe your fucking act.  You didn't fill it with, like, lists of things.  It was actual â€“ you actually wrote a book.  Yeah.  So I had to go, oh, shit, I actually want to write a book.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:00]  I don't want to do my act.  I don't want to run stuff that I've run on the internet.  There's only one thing that I did on my blog years ago.  It's a little two-page thing.  The publisher was like, we really like it.  Just put it in there.  It's two pages.  But the rest, I was like, I want it all to be original and kind of confessional.  And so thank you and fuck you for having that out there because that was against my back the whole time.  No, I appreciate that.  Thank you, man.  What's the book about there, Patton?  It's basically â€“ it's my autobiography done out of order as a series of comedic essays about things, about working the road and then my first job before I even realized. 
[02:28:30]  I wanted to be a comedian and then when I was really young, building snow forts.  So I tried to like nail exactly what my point of view in life was at that time.  So just embrace how completely ignorant I was about certain things and then you just sort of â€“ even as you keep getting smarter and smarter, there's still just shit you absolutely don't understand.  Yeah.  So I just want to â€“ because I just think that's what â€“ nothing is funnier to me than people who think that, all right, I get the deal now and you look at them like, oh, God, they have like decades of shit to learn. 
[02:29:00]  They're so not done.  Before you even get close.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't see the next subway train that's going to run them over.  Oh, okay.  I don't really know.  I stopped listening after Snowforts.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I fucking loved Snowforts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just remember that was a big deal.  You brought me back, man.  Yeah, that was a big deal about growing up because I did this whole thing of â€“ there's a chapter called We're Playing Snowfort, but you realize that I'm watching my friends' parents â€“ we lived in the suburbs, but there was a lot of like kind of 70s divorce slash alcoholism slash swinging going on. 
[02:29:30]  Where was the suburbs of â€“  Sterling, Virginia, northern Virginia.  Wow.  And â€“ but I'm looking at it through my eight-, nine-year-old eyes, and I don't quite know what â€“ like if you read it, you'll go, oh, I see what he's looking at, but I have no idea.  I think it's all some kind of wonderful adventure.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the parents are really friendly with each other.  So â€“  When did you realize it was swinging? 
[02:30:00]  Like were your parents involved in it?  No, that's the thing that I actually appreciate about my parents.  My parents were so square and boring and kind of just, you know what, go to soccer practice and bedtime at nine, and my friends' parents would let them smoke weed and go to concerts and stay out late.  So I craved getting out and variety and having kind of a weird artistic life, and my friends, even though their parents were fun, their parents were also kind of scary because they would just â€“ I couldn't pay the mortgage this month. 
[02:30:30]  But, hey, those belly dancing lessons were fun, weren't they, that we took for no reason.  So they grew up all wanting to be totally like married and kids, and everything is completely reliable.  So they're still nice people, but they're not â€“ they never got out and kind of wandered because they craved normalcy.  Wow, yeah.  Because you had so much normalcy, you went the other way.  Yeah, exactly, because I just knew, oh, my parents are okay.  They'll be fine.  They'll be there.  My other friends are like, I don't know what the hell my parents are doing.  You know, my dad's moving out. 
[02:31:00]  It just â€“ there was all this weirdness, so they have become â€“  That was my growing up, though.  I was the one with the crazy family.  Oh, really?  But then he also became a crazy alcoholic, so there goes that.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  So, boom, yeah, it blew my theory.  I went right into it.  Right.  I took up where it left off.  I am the sequel.  Yeah, exactly.  I'll take the baton from here.  Oh, I got it, guys.  I got it.  You sit down.  Watch this.  Rotted liver part due.  Sorry, I don't mean that. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  No, but please.  Yeah.  But, no, like, that just seems to me, from my experience, that's what happens to a lot  of people.  Yeah.  When you see very normal, stable people, you go into their background, a lot of them  come from really fucked up childhoods.  Yeah, yeah.  And they want that stability so bad.  I just noticed that everyone I know is from a fucked up childhood.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know, especially girls.  How many people escape that shit?  Girl, any girl that has come through my life at any point in my life have all been bat 
[02:32:00]  shit crazy.  Yeah.  Just bat shit crazy.  And then I've been told that, well, that's the pond you're looking in.  Yeah.  I'm like, but that's the pond where the fish fuck really well.  The most healthy fish in the pond.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  Hatred of a father builds a strong pelvis.  It really does.  There is some kind of those muscles in there. 
[02:32:30]  Boom, man.  It's like, I'm going to powder this memory with my pussy lips.  Oh, fuck, man.  Hey, uh, by the way, Ratatouille's still on DVD.  Great blue for the kids.  Oh, yes.  Check that out.  That's right.  You, uh, you got a voice in that one, huh?  Yeah.  I always love to throw that in after I've said the worst possible thing I can.  The worst, most heinous thing.  Do you, I don't know if you've ever gotten this, but I've gotten this a couple of times.  Some guy told me, I saw this guy, uh, and we were talking, he goes, dude, I saw an interview 
[02:33:00]  with Robin Williams and he gave you props.  I'm like, really?  So, you know, look, I'm, I'm, please, I'm human.  So I went home and I watched Robin Williams on Charlie Rhodes and that was Charlie Rhodes  and fucking like 10 minutes into it.  He's like, Oh yeah.  And then there's comedians like Patton Oswalt and he was speaking very highly.  Yeah.  And I'm like, if that piece of shit guy mistook me and I watched 45 more minutes, not one  Norton mentioned, I've been confused for you a couple of times.  I've had people say, yeah, yeah.  I honestly, it's like just people that don't know comedy that well.  We don't look that similar, but I've had a couple of guys, that guy and another guy. 
[02:33:30]  I'm like, sure you fucked him.  Yes.  That tranny.  Thanks, Spence.  Hey, by the way, my name's Patton Oswalt.  She thought I was Patton.  She's like, I'm the king and I'm a queen.  You know what I mean?  But yeah, I had a couple of times where I was confused with Patton.  Have you ever gotten that?  Good God, that's depressing.  Especially the Robin Williams.  I went home and watched the whole interview.  Wow.  I'd love to tell you I didn't care.  But what a great way to fuck with Jimmy also.  Yeah, exactly.  A big comedian say he was mentioned on a show, so Jimmy's got to sit there and obsessively watch it. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, I was on fucking YouTube looking for Charlie.  Well, it couldn't have been his 2005 interview.  It had to be the recent one.  Like, what a needy asshole.  I get, it's not that I get mistaken for anyone in particular.  Like, I just get in, you know, like, when you're on something and someone goes, yeah, I saw you on that show, King of Raymond.  And you realize that a lot of people watch TV, it's just a blur in the background.  And they don't quite know how they know you.  They know they've seen you do something.  Like, I don't know what the, because you show up on a lot of stuff. 
[02:34:30]  And so you must get, you know, especially this last year with Bored to Death and Louie, which are very kind of, their shows kind of live in parallel universes.  Do people ever get that messed up with you?  Yeah, they know you from somewhere.  I love this one, too.  I'm a big fan.  Your name, like, they always just.  I'm a big fan.  I've had that many times.  Yeah, I don't know you.  They don't even know your name.  They just know that they've seen you on TV.  And I never know what to say.  If it's a hot chick, you tell her, like, oh, yeah, I'm a comedian.  Yeah.  But when guys are like, where do I know you from?  I'm like, well, I come here often.  I really do.  I'm here a lot. 
[02:35:00]  And they're like, oh, all right.  I never want to give them the, I'm on TV.  Give a fuck.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  Some guy in an elevator.  Then if you go, yeah, I'm on TV.  Okay, so what?  Name some stuff.  You're like, what is this now?  Come on, man.  It turns into a quiz show for me.  Get the fuck out of here.  Go to my IMDb.  I met Mike Starr.  You know Mike Starr?  Oh, yeah.  We did an episode of Ed together many years ago.  It was like 2001.  And I recognized him.  And I'm like, I know you.  I'm like, he's like, oh, okay.  I'm like, what were you in?  He goes, what?  You want my resume?  And I was like, oh.  I was so embarrassed. 
[02:35:30]  But it was an awkward question.  He is one of those guys.  He is in so much stuff.  Yeah.  That it is hard.  I saw him in a Starbucks in L.A.  And I had just rewatched Ed Wood.  So I was lucky to go, oh, you're seeing an Ed Wood.  He plays that.  He plays the exploitation filmmaker that hires.  I don't remember.  He hires him to do Glenn or Glenda.  And he's so hilarious.  He's like, they go, do you have a script yet?  No, we got a poster.  And it's a sex change thing.  Those Okies out in the Midwest, they love that sex stuff. 
[02:36:00]  They got it all.  Like, he's so hilarious.  We already sold the Midwest.  Yeah, we sold the whole Midwest.  I got to get this movie made.  Like, all he has is a poster for this shitty movie.  A poster.  Yeah.  So it's just awesome.  Yeah, Mike Starr is one of those.  He's like, J.T.  Walsh had that kind of face where you know him and you see him in everything.  Most people didn't know the guy's name.  He turns up in so much stuff.  Mike Starr, wasn't he in Goodfellas?  He was in Goodfellas.  You're looking at him.  Yeah.  I'm the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the coming Don.  I'm the Midnight Date man.  Security. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I've seen him in scenes with Nicholson, obviously with De Niro and Leon.  It's like he's done scenes with fucking everywhere.  That's right.  He was in, he's in Mad Dog and Glory and him and David Caruso have a fight up in an apartment  and it's so funny because they're beating the shit out of each other, but they're also  going, watch the glass, you asshole.  Like, don't break this.  It's this very realistic fist fight, the way that two guys would actually fight each other.  Like, I can't, fuck, it's such a good scene. 
[02:37:00]  God damn it.  Yeah.  Watch it.  I just remember as they're, I mean, they're really pummeling each other, but they're also  like, that is glass there.  Don't back me up against that.  God damn it.  When you fight with rules, guys, I fight with rules.  Yeah, you see that whole, not the hair, the hair.  God damn it.  I hate to have to ask you, what's the title there, Zombie Spaceship Wasteland?  That's the whole, that's my idea about how when you're starting off as a, trying to do  something creative, especially if you're a geek like me, you have no fucking idea how 
[02:37:30]  the world works because you're just this young suburban smacked ass.  So anything you start writing or making as a movie, you'd have to do it, set it in a zombie  world out in space or in a wasteland because you don't know how the, you got to wipe the  world out first.  Right.  You can't.  There's been a, yeah, because I don't know how to pay a utility bill or how the court system  works yet.  So you, or even how like, yeah, so there's so many, like, and if you notice a lot of  people's first stuff, it's either they do some space opera or they do this zombie thing. 
[02:38:00]  Zombie is great.  You're like, well, yeah, there's zombies.  So there's no laws.  You got to get a gun and a can of food.  You don't have to know how shit works.  That's, that's the first thing that you don't have to be able to be, you don't have to be  able to interpret life and write about it or put it to film.  Yeah.  You just make it up because everything's gone.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  Well, even, even comedians have that, have that thing.  At least I did.  When I, when you start off, you're so nervous and you're so insecure that what you do is 
[02:38:30]  if you, if you watch comedians, especially my early stuff, all I'm doing is pointing out  how stupid everything is and how I'm brilliant for the knows how dumb this is.  And this guy's a fucking asshole.  And this guy's an idiot.  And then it takes you a while to get older to go, okay, here's some stupid shit I learned  about myself.  Like, here's how I'm a fucking idiot.  But when you're young, you, you're too terrified to go up there and go, oh, here's a stupid  thing I did.  At least I was.  You're afraid they won't relate to it.  You figure they relate to, uh, I found out my first bit of press, it was my friend's 
[02:39:00]  brother wrote for a local paper and it's a real cheese dick picture of me.  And he's like, what are you talking about?  I'm like, oh, you know, like game shows, things that really upset me.  Oh, I should be fucking executed.  Yeah.  My, my, I have a comedian friend named, uh, Dave Anthony who said that you can tell like  the young comedians, cause they're just angry at nothing.  They just think you're supposed to be angry.  So like, what's the deal with toast?  It's a fucking piece of bread and then it's hot.  Now it's crunchy.  Bullshit.  Like, it's just like you, you literally have not done anything yet. 
[02:39:30]  You're just, you're grasping for things to be angry.  Yeah.  So it's the, it's, it's when you get older that you're scared of and go, okay, listen  to this stupid bullshit I did.  You're not going to believe this.  Yeah.  You're not as afraid to not get her.  You kind of get a better sense.  They're going to relate just because they're people.  And also you're confident.  You're trying to be, uh, you're trying to keep this, um, image of that.  You're cool and self-deprecation.  Uh, you don't see that as being cool when you're, you're younger.  You see this.  I don't want to point this out myself. 
[02:40:00]  Uh, perish the thoughts.  Somebody else sees this.  Yes.  Uh, and there's nothing less funny than cool.  That is the unfunniest thing on the planet is cool.  It's somebody trying to be cool.  Oh God, it's pain.  Rock star comedians are fucking horrendous.  Oh God, because you're also, you're trapped.  Once you establish that the whole thing is that I'm cool.  You can never become vulnerable or go like, you're just, you're just fucked.  People like that.  We, for, for years, like we would do the show and not point out when we fucked up. 
[02:40:30]  Mistakes and stuff.  Like we would fuck shit up and just have to stutter and kind of go, uh, and then just move on to something else.  And then when Jimmy came aboard on the show, like, I came aboard.  I, I, I say that.  Believe me, I would, I would fucking gut you like a lamb for that.  But I said, welcome aboard to somebody.  I was fucking horrible.  And I meant it too.  I wasn't even being ironic.  I was like, really, welcome aboard.  It was a hallway thing.  When Jimmy joined the program.  Join the team, man.  He started pointing out the shit. 
[02:41:00]  Point out shit when we fucked up.  I was so uncomfortable.  I'm like, why are you doing that?  But it became so funny that you just can't wait sometimes to fuck up.  Turned out to be really important to the success of the show.  And that's the shit people always remember, too, because they go, oh, I fuck up like that.  And I try to hide it.  Yeah.  Right.  So you're not only fucking up, he's calling you guys for hiding it, which made Peteâ€”  And I get just like, oh, God, yes, I did that.  Okay, I did it.  That's what frees us in stand-ups, though.  It's like when you're onâ€”that's the hard part of acting is you can't call it out when it sucks. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  In the joke bombs, you can fucking justâ€”you can do what you want and control it.  Yeah.  But when you're bombing in a scene and you're like terrible and it's fucking horrifying.  It's really terrifying.  Jimmy just finally covered his mouth when he said that.  He goes, it's horrifying.  Oh, heavens.  Right.  Actually, we'll yell Masher and hit the man.  Breathe into a lilac-scented doily.  Have a touch of the vapors.  Oh, my goodness.  Get me a cucumber sandwich crust removed. 
[02:42:00]  Where are you going, Jimmy?  He's got an L.A. trip.  But why are you going to Arizona?  I'm shooting something for the Tonight Show, for this college thing, this collegeâ€”whatever  big game, BSU.  It's the BCS Championship.  I don't know what that is.  Is it like a bowl game?  Yeah, it's one of those big college bowl games.  It's the game every year.  So I'm shooting that Friday and Saturday, and then I go out Sunday, and then I justâ€”  What are you doing?  Like the parking lot?  I guess whatever theâ€”because the game is Monday, so I think I'mâ€”I just go on stage and pitch 
[02:42:30]  dating and shit to Jay onâ€”like, I just throw it to him on Monday night.  We're doing it Monday night.  Where in Arizona will you be?  I don't know.  I land in Phoenix, but it's like 20 minutes from Phoenix.  Glendale, I think.  I could be wrong.  That's fucked up.  A place like Arizona, you could land at the airport, and then it's five hours to go where  you want to go.  Arizona, it's a very beautiful state, but it's like you're living on a moon colony.  Yes.  You know, like it's very modern and nice, but everything is so sunbaked.  You're like, oh, did theyâ€”did theyâ€”did they terraform the moon? 
[02:43:00]  What the fuck am I doing here?  It's so fucking true.  We manufacture those.  Yeah.  And there's so many, like, preserved old people out there.  I know that Florida gets around for that, so the old people go, I think they go to Arizona.  Arizona, yeah.  That there's no moisture, so they just become like these living mummies.  They just die out there, man.  And they do hear about how that dry heat helps whatever ailments they have.  Something, yeah.  Arthritis or their lung ailments or anything.  Yeah, they got that Doc Holliday TV, so they kind of go preserve their lung tissue or something. 
[02:43:30]  Go out to Arizona, Lunger.  Yeah, Lunger.  Hey, Lunger.  People are healthy out there, though.  They look like the women out there are beautiful.  Oh, I know.  There's something about that.  Oh, they are some gorgeous.  Yeah, up until they're 23 and then look like fucking an old saddle.  Ten years after I need them.  The sun will fuck women.  Yeah.  Like, the worst part is the top of a woman's breast when she lives in a very sunny climate. 
[02:44:00]  It just becomes this beef jerky in a bra.  That's horrible, yeah.  It's horrid.  Yeah, it looks like an old millionaire's desktop.  You know, like where he'd be signing checks.  It's his blotter.  I will sign this check, and you'll never come to this estate again.  Goodbye.  I said good day, sir.  Good day.  Like, Arizona, the one thing I like is, and you'll notice this when you're there.  Well, no, it won't be that hot when you're there, but in the summertime, from like 11 a.m. 
[02:44:30]  until about 2.30, the city just shuts down.  Everyone just goes inside.  It's just too hot.  Yeah, and they either take a nap, or they just do their shit inside.  Everything kind of calms down.  I like that.  What do you think it is this time of year, like 65, 70?  It's gorgeous.  It's gorgeous right now.  Yeah.  I'm going to be really happy.  Yeah, I'm bringing a small coat.  Nothing heavy.  There are certain times of the year, and I'm always amazed that people actually live there.  And even here in the Northeast, because we get some snow and some really brutally cold weather,  and Buffalo, like that, where if a probe was sent down, and it landed in the right place 
[02:45:00]  at the right season, whatever beings would be like, there's no fucking way there's life there.  It's a wasteland.  It's a wasteland.  Because you think the whole planet is covered in ice.  Yeah.  It's 30 below zero.  Let's write this one off.  Or it's 120 degrees.  Yeah, it's a hellhole.  Who's that?  There's a comedian, Larry Amarose, who said, I come from Buffalo, New York.  They have two seasons, winter and July 8th. 
[02:45:30]  That's good.  I love that line.  And I've been in Buffalo.  That is exactly what it's like.  I lived there for three years.  Oh, you lived in Buffalo.  The winters go on for fucking ever.  And it snows every day until that fucking lake freezes.  And everything is frozen in ice, right?  Everything.  It's frozen solid.  I went through long johns because I would just wear them every fucking day to try to stay warm.  Yeah.  But you learned how to just adapt.  And people know how to drive on ice and snow there. 
[02:46:00]  It doesn't bother them at all.  Is that where at night you have to plug your car in or plug to keep it from freezing?  Oh, yeah.  There's like a blanket you put over your engine and plug it in so you're oiled.  Sure, yeah.  You can't really have an older car in Buffalo in the winter, no.  You're not going to get that thing started in the morning.  But every morning you had to fucking brush off your car from the snow that came.  And use that little de-icing spray for the rocks.  Everything.  You had all that shit.  You know, that's one thing about being kind of successful in a way, growing up a little bit and having some disposable income. 
[02:46:30]  I don't have to hear any more.  And that used to be a daily occurrence where you, like, pump the pedal twice on my old Chevy Nova or some shit and try to get that thing turned over.  The days of an old fucking car.  And then that distressing when it finally just gets down to the click.  What about the click? 
[02:47:00]  Got cables.  And also all those years of going in and negotiating with mechanics at some kind of sketchy garage.  And look, how can we just keep this thing running?  I'm telling you, when I was living in San Francisco, I had to just keep this old Jetta just moving so I could keep working.  And I had this really nice mechanic, but it was always like, okay, can we â€“ I have this much money.  What can you fix that will keep it going?  I know this thing isn't working.  But, you know, and it was just â€“ I always had a car in which I knew three or four things were just broken on. 
[02:47:30]  But he's like, you can still drive this without these things working.  As long as it keeps moving.  Yeah.  You can't â€“ no more air, no more heat.  But you can have these things, you know.  And now I just take my car to the dealer and go, make it run.  You'll fix.  And I'll be back.  I think it's still under warranty, sir.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't even â€“ that's the one luxury that I do is I just take â€“ make the thing go.  And then I just come back.  Having money rules.  Well, there is a certain thing. 
[02:48:00]  And if you come from, you know, shit and that kind of suburban â€“  Like we all did.  I mean, loading â€“ how many times do I load my friends up in my horrid car looking for girls  and thinking there's going to be six girls for every degenerate I'm hauling around with me?  Yeah.  And, like, coming from that and being able to afford things is nice.  I must admit.  Oh, it's great.  There's nothing wrong with money.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with money. 
[02:48:30]  I fucking love it, man.  It doesn't buy happiness, but it sure can eliminate some sadness.  Yeah.  You can wipe some of that out.  Yeah.  Yeah, money can't buy you happiness.  Great.  How much sadness can it make go away?  Yeah, that's all I need.  Or how much sadness can it keep me from?  Yeah.  How high can I build the wall between me and sadness?  The sadness barrier.  Yeah.  I'm building it with cash.  Yeah, where's that sadness â€“ where's that sadness deflecting barbed wire that money can buy?  Because that's pretty good. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, you're true, man.  When did you start â€“ you're doing very well.  When did â€“ I started probably â€“ maybe around 2001, I started doing okay, and then as years went on, I started.  But I was about 11, 12 years in before I started doing decent.  Not until the early â€“ not until the early aughts did I feel like I had actually some security because I just had â€“ I had incurred so many debts.  Wow.  You incur so much debt getting there.  Yeah.  And all the years that people just carried you, I was very determined to pay back debts, pay out credit cards.  And so I â€“ there were times like I was on TV for years and still lived in a very crappy apartment and drove a very old car because â€“ and people would see you and go, you're on TV. 
[02:49:30]  You're rich.  It's like, you don't really understand how it works.  It actually takes you a while after being â€“ you know, I've had friends that are writers that they publish five books and they're still working day jobs.  There's just no money in it for a long time.  I had the same disillusionment with our own Greg Opie Hughes here because he had his own show on WBAB on Long Island. 
[02:50:00]  When I met Anne, I was already 10 years in.  10 years in in the business.  10 fucking years in.  He was doing 7 and Midnight at BAB and I used to come on every so often and, you know, a little guest, have some fun, shit like that.  And I was under the impression that because he was on the radio, he was rich.  Yeah.  He has to be.  He's on the radio.  So we got to know each other a little more and he goes, hey, you want to come over, you know, watch a fucking movie, hang out at the house? 
[02:50:30]  Whatever it was, right?  I'm like, Cole sounds good.  So he's driving and I'm like following my piece of shit work van.  I was putting in air conditioning and heating duct work and I'm following him and we're going into Northport, which is a nice neighborhood in Long Island.  So you're thinking maybe a beach house on the water?  And I'm thinking beach house on the water.  Sure.  He makes the turn that is not the turn toward the nice houses.  That's the turn you were expecting.  He made that one turn to Northport where it was like, hey, wait a minute.  This isn't that place.  And we pull up in front of a house and now I'm like, all right, well, this maybe, and I actually thought this, maybe this is his summer house. 
[02:51:00]  Like, like this is just another one of his houses.  And then it went from that's his house to, wait a minute.  It's only half his house.  He's in an apartment in a house.  And I just, I fucking went like, oh no.  Then he cooked you a piece of toast with a coat hanger over a hot plate.  I remember, and I'm sure you remember this too, that that first year that I broke double digits as a comedian, I made $11,000 in 1992. 
[02:51:30]  I was living in San Francisco and it got to the end of the year and I had made $11,000 as a standup.  And I was kind of arrogant about it.  I was like, yeah, 11 grand.  That's pretty good.  And I, and again, I barely paid my rent.  I would always eat at this place called La Cumbra.  They had 75 cent burritos.  And then anywhere that I worked, I would try to work open mics where if you bought one drink, you could eat at the buffet or just eat the bar food.  And you had an attitude.  And I kind of had a chance like, yeah, I'm 11 grand.  I'm up in double digits now.  It's doing pretty good. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  It's really, stuff's happening now.  It's a cruise route.  It's 11 grand.  And I was kind of puffing my chest out.  Do you save your old calendar?  I hope to double that.  Well, that's what Patton's doing right now.  Yeah.  He's finally doubling that.  Do you save your old calendar?  I have all my old calendars.  Oh, I have 350 for the week.  You hoarder.  But I do hoard that stuff like where I would, I have my little, my little organizer.  Oh, yeah.  I would go to Wildwood.  I would do a week in Wildwood, like 14 shows for 350.  And then the second week you did there, you did 400 for 14 shows. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  And I have all, like, you look at my calendar.  No, for the whole week.  Yeah.  And it looks like, it looks like I'm some kind of weird, like, hoarder, OCD guy because  there are, you're doing gigs and, like, you will go somewhere.  If there's something in the afternoon, you'll do it.  Yeah.  You'll do, you'll, you'll do clubs and every single night, there's some one-nighter where  you're, you're driving out and you basically make enough money to put the gas in that  will get your car back.  I mean, it's, it's insane.  But you learn to love other comedians like that because, like, you know, Jim Florentine,  Bob Levy, those guys, we would go to that, we would go down to Maryland and do gigs and 
[02:53:00]  I would make $25 a show for three shows.  It was $75 for the weekend and no food and no room.  So those guys would buy me food and put me up.  Oh, that's nice.  They learn how to love other comics.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard this story hundreds.  Sounds like the nom.  Yeah, just keep your feet dry, Jim.  I've heard that same story probably told a hundred times at this point.  Why is it legendary that you guys just didn't get fucking paid?  I know the new guys, obviously.  Because club owners are pieces of shit.  But guys that are.  Back then, if you were, also, we're these young, terrified, smacked asses. 
[02:53:30]  We think that if we mouth off to one club owner, we won't work anywhere.  You'll never work in this town again.  So if they go, yeah, we'll give you a feature act.  You can do half.  And also they go, hey, you get to do half an hour.  And you're like, ooh.  Yeah.  Like, you get to do half an hour.  You get to work more.  And we'll give you $25.  And you just, you never negotiate.  You immediately.  I remember when I was at Garvin's, they banned Dave Chappelle because he was the first guy to go, no, pay me what I'm worth.  He wasn't even asking for crazy money. 
[02:54:00]  He was like 18 years old just going, do it half an hour.  Give me $50 a set.  Like, get the fuck out of here.  That was a good move by Garvin's.  Yeah, that was great.  Yeah.  Now you get the fuck out of here.  But I still don't understand why they keep you guys down.  You're proud, man.  Because they can.  Because we do it because we love doing it.  It's disgusting.  It is.  But eventually, if you will.  I mean, the comedy store to this day doesn't pay anybody.  Although it's not.  Neither does the improv.  Neither does the.  None of the city clubs do.  No.  Yeah, people don't know that out there.  The headline Carolines or comics or Gotham is different. 
[02:54:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  But for spots, none.  The improv pays $7.  Also, you remember you would do these one-nighters.  And it was very clear that the guy that was booking the one-nighter that booked you went  to this bar or restaurant or hotel lounge and said, yeah, I can book a comedy show for  you guys.  I'm going to need a budget of like $1,500.  Yeah.  And then he went through his three comics.  All right.  You get $15 to open.  And you get $25 to feature.  And you'll get $75 to headline.  And then he's pocketing the rest.  And you know that the gig will last probably three more weeks before they get hip to what 
[02:55:00]  he's doing.  But at that point, he's already found another land.  But like, that's how these guys would stay.  They would just keep sharking around.  And there'd be one headliner he trusted or whatever who would pick up the money.  Like, we would always have to pick up the money for the book.  Oh, yeah.  But one of the comedians that he knew wouldn't fucking tell the other comics how much he  was making.  Right.  Wow.  He'd be like, you know, he's paying out $300 and he's making $6.  Yeah.  What a piece of shit.  But he would trust the one guy to pick up his money.  Uh-huh.  It was really...  But you learn...  The guys that aren't willing to do that are the guys that are fucking long gone.  Right.  The guys that weren't willing to do that...  Had a plan we did.  You had to.  But then, you know, you make up for it in the end. 
[02:55:30]  You make up the money.  Yeah, because also what you have is you have so much stage time that when you do start  headlining, shit just doesn't faze you like it used to.  Because you're like, oh, I've been through so much worse than...  You're doing it to go through all the shit.  So that when you're headlining, you're not going to freak out and pee your pants and,  you know, pull a Michael Richards and run off stage.  Right, right.  And, you know, it wasn't that...  I'm not...  I don't think Michael Richards is a racist.  I think Michael Richards is a guy who didn't do a lot of stand-up, who got very successful  on TV and is suddenly on stage and freaks out. 
[02:56:00]  Couldn't handle a heckler.  Couldn't handle a heckler.  And if you listen to the guy that was heckling him, he sounded like a guy that could have easily  been handled.  Right.  You know, you're like, oh, if he just talked to him a little bit, he would have gone,  oh, okay, cool.  Right.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, it was a black table, obviously.  And, you know, as a comedian, it's like, that's frustrating when they start heckling you.  Sure.  But he just snapped.  Yeah.  If they were a table of fat white women who would have been like, you fat cunts!  Yeah.  He just dropped the A-bomb.  It would have been cunts instead of...  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  He just dropped the A-bomb. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  No matter what it was, he was going to go balls out.  He would go to the worst thing possible.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God it wasn't Dudley Moore.  You bring cancer comfort!  A lot of Dudley Moore.  Yeah, a lot today.  I know.  God rest his little short pudding-headed soul.  I'm hearing that the Patton Oswalt shows are all sold out at Caroline's.  I think, of course.  Oh, wow.  So you don't even have to be here.  So thanks for coming in, Patton.  Thanks for having me.  No, I want to ask you about something I have not seen, but I hear about a lot.  Why not?  The Maynard documentary from the guy from Tool, of course. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That guy...  You were part of that?  Yeah.  Maynard Keenan is great...  Love Tool, by the way.  I'm a big fan.  Tool, Perfect Circle.  Yep.  And, um...  Pucifer.  Pucifer.  Pucifer.  That's right.  That's right.  And he bought some old abandoned ghost town in Jerome, Arizona.  And I think it used to be a silver mine.  And he built a winery out there.  He bought the whole town?  I think he bought, like, a major part of the town.  Because I think it was selling for nothing. 
[02:57:30]  Just sitting there.  Right.  And he started a winery.  Did he lock the Brady's in a jail cell?  Trying to jump my claim!  Boy, I'm trying to grow great for you, Dan.  And every day, dude.  Yeah, he's getting this insane prospector out in the desert.  Last night, I drew a woman in the sand and had relations with her.  But he does this...  He does a...  They're called Merkin Vineyards, which I don't know what a Merkin is. 
[02:58:00]  And he does these amazing wines.  And they're really fucking tasty wines.  He's always been really into wines.  Yeah.  And what were you...  Was it a documentary on the whole thing?  I did a documentary about the thing.  And he had, like, some of his friends come in and taste some of the stuff.  And I came in and just gave him shit about the stuff.  I visited the winery, too.  It's really cool.  Yeah.  He's this bald ex-Marine rock star out there, you know, just with these barrels and just to hear it, taste this.  And he's out there growing grapes in the desert.  I didn't know he was an ex-Marine. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  He was in the...  He was in some kind of armed force.  There's footage of him on stage, either with tool or perfect cervical.  And some douchebag, like, runs up.  And Maynard...  I mean, it's so amazing.  He just flips the guy over his shoulder and slams him onto the ground and then just keeps singing.  It is such a fucking, you know, Bruce Willis in the last Boy Scout just, bam, just shoving up into his head, punk.  And then just keeps singing his song.  It's like, damn, what a badass.  I got to run.  I got to... 
[02:59:00]  What?  My flights, I have to, uh...  Where?  What?  He's going to Arizona.  People are saying you better have more than a light jacket.  It's cold.  Oh.  All right.  We're getting weather reports.  And then another guy's saying he's standing in a foot of snow out there.  But Arizona's a big place, so I don't know what part that is.  He's not in Arizona, foot of snow.  You will not be going into the mountains.  And he's not trekking.  Yeah, he's just going from the fucking airport to a limo to fucking wherever he's got to go.  He lands, puts his snowshoes on.  Yeah, yeah, and treks.  It's not a limo.  It's a car service.  That sounds better, though. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, is it a car service?  Yeah, it's a nice car.  All right.  Pat, great seeing you.  I'm going to take a walk.  Good to see you, too, man.  Yeah, we should have a flight.  Yes, I'll see you soon, man.  All right, man.  How long are you in New York for?  I'm here until Sunday.  Okay, I'll be gone by the time...  Next scene is Jimmy looking like Buscemi burying the money in Fargo.  What?  It is fucking freezing cold.  Wiping a tranny load off my face.  I got shocked!  I got shocked!  You should see the other guy's asshole.  All right, safe travels. 
[03:00:00]  Thanks, buddy.  Say hi on Twitter.  All right, man.  God bless, Jimmy.  Why don't we...  We can take a break, then.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  What are you on Twitter there, right?  It's just Patton Oswalt on there.  Patton Oswalt, lowercase, one word.  Yep.  Yeah, that's easy.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's good when you have your name just...  Exactly, boom, out there.  Could not be easier.  No other...  Did you get enough to get it from some idiot that was sitting on it?  No, thank goodness.  Oh, God.  Did I...  Was anyone sitting on your stuff, Jim, when you joined Twitter?  Or...  A fan was, but he just gave it to me.  He was this cool guy. 
[03:00:30]  I think Mostep is his name, and he actually had held it for me.  It was Mostep.  I know Mostep on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was very cool.  Oh, nice.  Good for you, Mostep.  I threatened you.  That's the right thing.  And he just...  And he pulled it up like him.  He's coming back.  Oh, that's nice.  All right, so Patton, we're going to take a break.  So it's Caroline's...  Yeah.  I'm hearing it sold out, but just in case, 212-757-4100.  You never know.  They might shove another show in there or something.  Who knows?  Give them a call to see what's going on with the shows this weekend.  And the book is Zombie Spaceship Wasteland.  You know what?  I'm going to read this fucking thing. 
[03:01:00]  Yes.  I just decided on the spot.  I got to read this book.  Especially read the chapter, The Victory Tour, about the worst 11 days on the road.  And have Jim read it, too.  I want to know what he thinks about that.  Absolutely.  I'd be very curious to know.  And you got to come back and see us.  Next time I'm in New York.  You having fun, right?  I'm glad that we finally got to do this forever.  We've been trying to do this forever.  And to your credit, people on Twitter will go,  When are you doing O.P. and Anthony?  I'm going with you.  And I would go, When they ask me.  I'm always in New York.  I'm going to give you so long, man.  Well, now we got the connections.  It's like a Three's Company episode. 
[03:01:30]  There was all this miscommunication.  We just never did it.  It's like, Yeah, why don't you do O&A?  And then you do the show.  You suck.  And it's been strange.  Fucking asshole.  I thought you were Patrice O'Neal.  Pat Noswell, you stink.  Wait a minute.  Fuck, that's good.  All right, guys.  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  I'm off.  You killed today, man.  Thanks, man.  That was terrific radio.  All right, guys.  Relaxing.  We'll be back.  Thanks.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[03:02:00]  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. </pre>
