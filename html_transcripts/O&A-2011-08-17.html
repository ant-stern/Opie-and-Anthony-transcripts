<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts repeatedly shouting the show's name before launching into a discussion about a controversial "To Catch a Predator" case resulting in an acquittal, sparking debate over entrapment and a subsequent lawsuit against the show.  They then transition into a discussion about the speed of modern news dissemination compared to the past.  Opie recounts a vitriolic Twitter feud with Chris Brown's fans, using highly offensive and derogatory language to describe them and detailing his equally abusive responses.  This leads to a humorous, albeit vulgar, segment inventing nicknames based on a "Easy, Breezy, Beautiful" theme.

The show then shifts to Opie's grievances concerning two YouTube videos: one using his "Bowling for Behave" song with offensive imagery, and another deceptively splicing his clips into an ABC News report on lone wolf killers.  They follow this with a discussion of a man accidentally shooting himself in the groin with his girlfriend's pink pistol, demonstrating a distinct lack of sympathy for his actions.  A brief mention of Gerard Depardieu's airplane incident follows.  The discussion then moves to a prolonged, mocking conversation with Sam Roberts, a show employee requesting a raise,  filled with offensive jokes and weight estimations of Sam and a colleague, Travis.  The segment ends with the announcement that Keith Robinson and Jerry Springer are upcoming guests.

A segment promoting Jerry Springer's "Baggage," specifically the "Baggage First Dates" special,  initially expresses skepticism about the show's success before transitioning into a lengthy, vulgar discussion about Hulk Hogan, Linda Hogan, and various wrestlers, filled with allegations of homosexuality and infidelity and featuring audio clips related to these rumors. A WrestleMania video clip is also shown.  Jerry Springer then joins the show in studio.  The conversation covers Springer's opinions on Michelle Bachmann's political gaffes, the political climate, the American economy, healthcare, and tax policies.  A brief interview with Elizabeth Berkley about her iPod ownership occurs.  Anthony Cumia delivers a graphic public service announcement about being transgender.  Throughout this segment,  multiple discussions about the show's producer, Roland, and accusations of his lying occur.

The show continues with a lengthy discussion focusing on Linda Hogan's allegations about Hulk Hogan and Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake, and other wrestlers' alleged homosexuality,  sourced potentially from The Ultimate Warrior. The hosts speculate about the motivations behind the claims, possibly linked to Hogan's book sales.  Rob, a caller, shares a story about Brutus Beefcake leaving cocaine at his MBTA workplace, mistaken for anthrax, prompting further off-color jokes.  Jim Norton's upcoming show is promoted, along with a contest where listeners can win a date with Bobo and $1000 sponsored by Trojan condoms. Keith Robinson joins the show.  Frustrations with toll increases and negative AOL customer service experiences are also aired.

A large portion focuses on the "date with Bobo" contest, highlighting "Lady Trucker," a large female contestant.  The hosts receive calls from several female and one male contestant, "Pirate Trucker."  The discussion is filled with vulgar and offensive remarks about the contestants, racial slurs, homophobic language, and explicit sexual content. A particularly confrontational call with Jackie from Long Island dominates the segment, marked by highly offensive exchanges, culminating in Jackie attempting a racist game.  Keith Robinson's presence in the studio is mentioned, along with explicit discussions of sexual acts and body shaming.  Pictures submitted for the contest, particularly Lady Trucker's, are discussed.

The show continues with an aggressive and insulting interview of Jackie, featuring personal attacks on her appearance, race, profession, and marital status.  The conversation meanders to Craigslist ads, Texas handgun laws, and Jackieâ€™s alcohol preference.  The focus then shifts to accusations of Roland lying, followed by a debate about "tweaking the truth" in their profession, specifically concerning the accuracy of a "sex buzzer" related to Eric's arrival times at work.  A lengthy debate ensues about Eric's punctuality, marked by accusations of lying and conflicting accounts of the buzzer.  The segment ends with arguments and personal attacks.  Keith, a comedian, is present in the studio for part of this segment.

A final segment features a contentious exchange between the hosts and Troy, a staff member, centering on Troy's perceived tardiness and poor work ethic.  The hosts use highly offensive language.  Eric, a caller, is brought on, praised for his punctuality in contrast to Troy, resulting in further discussions about Eric's work habits and the hosts' skepticism. The segment concludes with promotional announcements for the show, including initially incorrect broadcast times, and mentions of Sway Calloway and his show on Shade 45, and Mars, another staff member or regular contributor, as an "Eric supporter."

[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Hey, we didn't get a morning out of you.  I'm just reading this.  Didn't get a harumph out of you.  Yeah.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Why did everybody turn against to catch a predator?  What happened?  How did people say that the guy was acquitted, one of the guys who was...  actually went to trial? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  I'm just reading this as we're starting the show, and the judge scolded the show and his  producers for entrapment.  What?  How do you trap somebody?  Mr. Hargis cut off?  Yay.  How do you trap somebody into going to driving a hundred miles to have sex with a 13?  Yeah, yeah.  I must have a good lawyer.  Must have a good lawyer.  Ugh.  So the one got away, then, is what you're saying?  He's the only one that actually fought it.  He's the only guy?  I think so.  The other ones all play the guilty. 
[00:05:00]  Well, how did he get away with it, then?  I guess there's not enough evidence.  In a trial, there's not enough evidence.  Right.  He wanted to just cuddle and watch movies.  Yeah, right.  Aw.  That's cute.  Come on.  And his mother is suing the show's...  They made his life a living hell.  Good.  Oh, really?  A guy that wants to fucking...  Yeah.  Fucking 13-year-old?  That's what he gets.  That's going over the house?  Fuck a 13-year-old.  Ugh.  That's how the mother wants to sue.  Should sue the mother for raising a fucking pervert! 
[00:05:30]  A pedo.  Yeah.  World's insane.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Now they're going after a show like To Catch a Predator?  Seriously?  That's silly, right?  That was a fine, fine show.  I've given up on the whole planet.  I used to say, as a nation, we're doomed.  Now, as a planet, we're just doomed on a planetary level.  I blame the media.  Fucking asteroid just comes and destroys this whole fucking rock of shit.  I blame the media, though.  Seriously.  We've talked about it many times over the years.  You know, there was a time you didn't know what the fuck was going on anywhere else. 
[00:06:00]  In some cases, you didn't even know what was going on in the other side of the country.  Yeah, it would take like a day, at the least a day, before shit would come from the other side of the world.  Like, news from China or something.  Sometimes it would take a week.  Right.  I mean, when we were growing up, if there was some shit going down, let's say, in the Middle East.  Yeah.  Okay, it would be NBC News, right?  Or CBS News.  And it would be some shaky camera that was propped on a mountain somewhere, and you knew some shit maybe was going on in the valley. 
[00:06:30]  These images taken last week.  I think it ramped up, what, during the Vietnam War is when it kind of all started?  They called that one the Living Room War.  Yeah, but that wasn't even, you know, they would ship over some images, but, you know, that was delayed.  I think we're better off not knowing what's going on out there.  I really do.  That first Gulf War was the first one where we were all like, fucking, hey, this is real-time shit. 
[00:07:00]  Cool.  When you saw the fucking missiles going into the chimneys and stuff.  You're like, what?  What?  I'm like, whoa, that's cool.  That's how it looks.  Holy shit.  And now we just get panic every single second of the day.  Now it's shang, alerts, news, bah, 20,000 things on the screen.  It's all fucking pandemonium.  Not even news.  I mean, if you're on Twitter, you're getting your news way the fuck before they throw it on TV now.  You're getting it from where it happened.  Yeah.  Like, as it happened, you're like, oh, okay. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  I guess that'll hit the news at some point today.  I don't know if that's good.  I don't know either.  I think it makes us all stressed out.  Yeah, what do you think?  Good?  Or stressed, yeah?  Yeah, because there's nothing we can really do about it.  No.  So it's better not to see it, I think.  I was just having a huge...  I barely got any sleep last night.  Thank God I took a very long nap during the day.  because I was just involved in a war with Chris Brown fans.  Chris Brown fans.  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of shoehorned my way into it, to be honest, because it was Andy Levy's battle. 
[00:08:00]  Andy Levy made a joke that was very funny on Twitter.  What was the joke?  I read part of the annoyance by people.  Yeah.  Chris Brown said something about he's going to stop planking unless it's on a hot woman.  Something to that effect.  And Andy just said, you spelled punching wrong. 
[00:08:30]  It's a hysterical joke.  Funny.  Because, I mean, the guy did punch Rihanna in the face, viciously beating her face.  There's no doubt.  I don't have to say allegedly nothing.  He punched her in her fucking face.  And, yeah, bruised her up pert good.  God, I'm looking at your timeline.  You were up all fucking night.  Oh, yeah.  What's wrong with you?  I was up quite a while.  Well, I slept until like 6 p.m.  This guy's...  All right.  Yeah.  And then I finally, like, cast in my chips late. 
[00:09:00]  What's that?  What?  Huh?  But Andy, then, I guess Chris Brown tweeted Andy and was, you know, giving him some, you  know, why you be hatin' kind of shit.  And then all of his minions come out and just start bashing Andy Levy in the most ignorant  fucking tweets I think I've ever read.  These are amongst some of the most illiterate people with the most moronic ideology I've 
[00:09:30]  ever fucking read.  They are defending a man that beat the shit out of a woman's face because Andy Levy joked  about it.  Andy, who's an upstanding man, has a good gig.  Um, you know, served his country, went to school, he's an intelligent guy, and these fucking 
[00:10:00]  morons are coming out and bashing him and sticking up for a guy that punched a woman in  the face.  For making fun of it.  Yeah.  For making a joke about something that actually happened.  And, um, well, I just couldn't sit by, idly sit by, and watch this happen when I saw an  opportunity to make plenty of really fun jokes about these idiotic people that were tweeting. 
[00:10:30]  I think you tweeted a hundred times since we'd been on the air.  Oh, yeah.  It was crazy.  Holy shit.  I, I went right to the source, right to the, um, right to the, the, the thread, the string  that everybody was, was posting on and just kept, it was, it was a turkey shoot.  There was so many idiots.  It was so easy, you know, just fat, these fat, disgusting sows sticking up for Chris Brown  like they think he's going to fucking come over their house. 
[00:11:00]  They, they, they hashtag something like, I guess, team breezy.  What's breezy?  Come on, help me out, Sam.  Breezy is like Brown, like Lil Wayne is wheezy.  Yeah.  Kanye is, or Kanye West is wheezy.  They didn't like the breezy.  They didn't like the remark.  I said, what, why breezy?  Is that what the women feel when he just misses?  Oh, they didn't like that one very much. 
[00:11:30]  What, what, he, Chris Brown wrote, he, he wrote, Danny Levy, go ahead.  Children conduct themselves better.  Much love and success.  Yeah.  He wrote children conduct themselves better.  And I went, oh really?  During, during a fucking flash mob?  Really?  See, cause I had to get that in there.  Team breezy.  Wait, does he have anything to do with flash mobs?  No, but young black people do.  So I had to throw that in there.  Holy shit, you're shooting everyone.  Because the people that were.  Concentrate, focus. 
[00:12:00]  I was, believe me, a racist cracker, shit like that comes out, of course I'm gonna fucking  jump on.  Some guy's profile was that my, my, uh, my father is Cuban, my mother is African, and  on September 9th of 19 fucking 80-something, I was born, I'm like, shame your dad didn't  just diddle your mom with a Cohiba and leave.  It got real bad.  It was great.  I loved it.  I had a great time, and then I finally just had to go to sleep.  I want to know more about the Easy, though. 
[00:12:30]  Easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl.  Should we have Easy names?  Can I be O-Peezy?  Oh, O-Peezy?  No?  It would be Peezy, I think.  You're just Peezy?  I would just be Peezy?  That sucks.  You can't go O-Peezy.  That's too close to Pees.  I'm sleazy.  I'm Chip-a-ceezy.  No, Chip, that doesn't matter.  Who's Chip-a-ceezy?  Chip would obviously be Cheezy.  No, it's Chip-a-ceezy.  Wait, but our real name, he's just Cheezy?  Uh, Jeezy?  Jeezy, Jim.  Jim is Jeezy.  What's Ant? 
[00:13:00]  Ant would be...  H-Neezy.  Let's see.  You take the first half of my last name and then put Easy other...  Cumzies.  Cumzies.  I'd be Cumzies.  I'd be Cumzies.  Cumzies.  Uh-oh.  Oh my God.  I think I hope you just call yourself Peezy.  I don't want to be Peezy.  Ant would have to be Seezy.  Why does mine have to be lame?  Peezy, Peezy, Japanesey.  That's right. 
[00:13:30]  Let's see.  That's ridiculous.  Breezy.  Shut up!  So, this guy wrote, haven't I seen you on To Catch a Predator, my dude?  Yeah, that apparently is a big insult in the community, is to say that you were on To Catch a Predator.  Because it's all like, it's usually white guys, and they said that Andy looked like a creepy guy that would have been on To Catch a Predator.  But they didn't say To Catch a Predator.  They wrote, how to catch a predator.  Well, I'm in on this now, because you're, broad strokes with you. 
[00:14:00]  I want to read these tweets now.  Oh, yeah.  So then Anthony writes, ha ha, man, you are in some shit here, Andy.  Too funny.  Fuck, I just fucked it up.  Yeah, because I knew he was in the shit at that point.  Well, Chris Brown has four million followers, so if he tweets just like, children act better.  Yep.  That was actually a smart way for him to handle it.  He knew that there's probably enough people to see that.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's been a Chris Brown army that's formed, like, more than maybe anybody else on Twitter.  Team Breezy.  If you insult Chris Brown, his fans are rabid. 
[00:14:30]  Like, anybody who insults Chris Brown on Twitter, they'll go after.  Well, isn't it like our fans?  Yeah, of course.  Four of them.  Well, it says Chris Brown, four million.  Andy Levy, 40,000.  Nice.  So I wrote, so bashing a woman's face in gets your followers, huh?  Wow.  That's how it works.  All right, this guy writes, you should go suck on some big hairy ball bag.  And then Anthony writes, nice pick there, precious.  Ha, slob.  Yeah, because she's a big, fat, fucking pig.  Another pig. 
[00:15:00]  So right now.  His army of pigs.  Right now, it's still Andy's war, but it's slowly moving into your war is what I'm getting at here.  Well, Andy works for Fox News.  I understand that.  So are you.  There are some things.  Well, yeah, right.  You're a contributor to Fox.  There are some things Andy can't go on and say.  This one.  I hate ignorant people who make unnecessary comments.  It's people like Andy Levy.  Ant writes to this person, great weave, really natural looking.  Oh, boy.  Well.  Here we go.  Oh, boy.  I just had a say. 
[00:15:30]  And then this person goes to Andy Levy.  Are you gay?  You look it.  Fuck you, faggot, and eat a dick.  I'm sure you do daily.  And then Anthony writes to this person, because now Andy can't comment, because he works for Fox.  Yeah.  That nose looks like my Stang's hood scoop.  Yeah.  I have no idea what that is.  My Mustang's hood scoop has a couple of real big intakes for the turbo.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Oh, this woman was just disgusting.  You made fun of her big nostrils, did you? 
[00:16:00]  They were fucking ridiculously huge.  Was she pretty?  No.  She was a slob, like all these fucking team breezy fucking bitches.  You're all slobs who don't understand.  It's a guy that punched a fucking pretty girl in the face.  So what do you want?  What do you think he's going to do with you, you fat pig?  Shut up.  All right.  Oh, they're disgusting pig-faced women.  Let's see.  Oh, God.  Look at this.  Look at that disgusting mess.  And her Twitter name actually has Breezy in it. 
[00:16:30]  Of course it does.  That's what happens when she passes by you.  You feel a Breezy.  It's like a fucking rock coming down the side of a mountain.  Oh.  So then, uh, Andy Levy, children conduct themselves better.  Much love and success.  And Anthony jumped in and said, like, the children flash mobbing.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, children conduct themselves better.  Oh, really?  Do they?  Really?  That's, uh, you know.  I was making my points at 2.30 in the morning.  Chris Brown fans just didn't know who they were dealing with.  Uh, this one.  They did not. 
[00:17:00]  An immature idiot.  Andy, what do you expect, dumbass?  You think you're the shit, but you're not.  Don't fuck with Chris Brown.  And then Ant writes, get a job.  Yes.  I wrote, get a job.  I finally did, uh, say that I had to go to sleep because I gotta, gotta get up for work.  And then I went, oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's where you go, or that's where I go to make the money you get.  See?  Saying that I work, I make money, and I ship it over to your sorry fucking ass.  Well, we don't. 
[00:17:30]  We also call them ignant.  Yeah, yeah, I said ignant.  Uh, yeah.  Like I said, I'd love to keep chatting with you ignant Chris Brown team breezy shitheads.  You call them shitheads.  But I've gotta go to work.  You call them shitheads?  Yeah.  But I gotta go to work.  Oh, see?  That's where we make the money you get.  At, like, jobs.  Well, listen, well, I'm getting there.  So then, uh, to Andy, oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, that was hilarious.  Now, do everyone a favor and die.  I guess they're commenting on his joke, the original joke.  And you wrote, maybe a goon can beat your flat ass one day. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  They wrote that to you?  No, I wrote that.  No, no, Ant just jumped in on the fight.  I just, I completely piled on with no real need or, uh, asking or anything.  I just saw a battle that I wanted to get in on.  Here's one.  Oh.  So, uh, to Andy Levy, it was written, if you think you could hurt Chris Brown with one tweet,  then you are totally wrong.  Anthony writes, why?  Chris can hurt a bitch with one punch. 
[00:18:30]  Well, it's true.  This guy writes, I guess Andy Levy just wanted more followers.  And Ant writes, holy pig face.  Chris Brown wouldn't even punch you.  Jesus.  Ah, I was sleepy.  Uh, to Andy Levy, will you please recall your 40-year-old fans for my mentions?  Laugh my ass off.  Shit's too pathetic.  Ugh.  And then you want to be pig face.  Yeah, see that, she's a wannabe pig face.  Oh, you want to be pig face?  She's a wannabe. 
[00:19:00]  I could have said something else.  I didn't.  Well, now they're really.  I'm very careful on Twitter.  Everyone's jumping in on this fight.  Who the fuck is Andy Levy?  I don't even know him.  And you write, he's a man with a job who contributed.  Who contributes to society.  You wouldn't know him.  See?  Andy, loser dick.  LOL.  How old are you?  70?  And then you write, is the whole breezy thing what bitches feel when Chris Brown just misses?  Yeah, see?  You got to get in there with the breezy thing.  Yeah.  Andy Levy isn't on MTV, you pig.  Or any time when people are awake. 
[00:19:30]  Irrelevant.  Yeah, that's somebody else.  Maybe I'm going to have to read all these.  Breezy's Beauty.  I'm trying to read just a better word.  Andy, wow, you're a real dickhead.  Leave Chris Brown alone.  Anthony writes, yeah, Andy.  You know how many flash mobs you're ruining tonight?  Yeah, because they couldn't coordinate with their Twitter to flash mob because they were  all piling on Andy.  So Andy was fucking up like so many flash mobs, I guess, last night. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  Now you're...  How many 7-Eleven employees were just so happy going like, wow.  You're really starting to feel it here.  Yeah.  Anthony just writes this couple defenders.  I'm not sure, but I don't think Andy ever viciously beat a woman like your pussy fucking  hero.  See?  What?  He beat a woman in the face.  And now...  She's over it.  Now here's the best part.  They now have moved on from Andy Levy.  They notice you're the problem, so they're not even mentioning Andy Levy in the tweets  anymore.  Now it's officially your battle. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, I had to take on that, yeah.  This person says, Anthony, what are you trying to say?  And then Anthony writes, you mean, what are you trying to say?  Ignorant fucking goon.  English asshole.  Yeah.  Guy goes...  He goes...  What you...  He actually tweeted, what you trying to say.  It's like, what?  No, it's, what are you trying to say?  Fuck!  And this guy writes, Anthony, so does coming at someone half your age make you feel like  more of a man?  And you write, I come on someone half my age. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Coming on...  No, I come on someone half my age.  Half my age.  That, see, because she was trying to be witty.  That fucker mouth, though.  That fucking slob.  Is she fat?  Ugh.  Look at her.  Look at that fucking disaster.  She looks like one of those women you see on a Hoardage show.  She's trying to put...  And that is the ultimate trying with the, uh...  Wait, that's it?  Yeah, that's Facebook fucking voodoo she's trying there.  Yeah, you're probably right. 
[00:21:30]  Her eyes are awful.  Look at her.  She's fucking pushing up the tits.  Pushing up the tits.  She's got a hard fucking face.  Yeah, fuck her.  Breezy bullshit.  This person points out that Chris Brown has over 4 million followers.  Andy has 40,000.  Yeah.  And you write, so bashing a woman's face in gets you followers, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, that must be the criteria.  Wow, it just goes on and on.  Yeah.  Trying to read some of the...  My eyes were, my eyes were, like, tearing by the time I went to sleep. 
[00:22:00]  I was just, I can't read this anymore.  Yeah, it keeps going and going.  Wow, you were in a battle.  Yeah, yeah.  It was wild last night.  In the wee early hours of the morning, actually.  Team Breezy doesn't sleep.  Team Breezy don't sleep, yo.  And apparently Team Breezy don't work.  That's the kind of what I was getting from it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, you can't be hurting and hating on my friend Andy Levy without catching some shit. 
[00:22:30]  I got you back.  I got you back, Andy.  Yo's.  Let me say hi to Jason in Canada.  Jason.  Thank you, Greg.  Hey.  I think the urban shorthand for Anthony would just be Nazi, wouldn't it?  Easy, Breezy, Nazi.  Nazi.  Nazi.  Nazi.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Hey, man, boop.  I love my Jewish friends. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, did you see Kurt Love 666?  He put your Bowling for Behave song to video on YouTube?  I certainly did.  I do not condone what he has done with a song that was meant to be fun.  Fun.  Yeah, I wasn't sure what you wanted to do with it.  He put it together nicely, but I wasn't going to retweet it until I got your approval on  that one.  It's a fun song that's light and meant to be taken in the spirit to which it was written  by Drew Boogie, and he's put evil images to it to twist it into some horrid, racist-looking 
[00:23:30]  thing.  Things like this, gang-related violence.  It's going to be minorities.  Why was the Planet of the H clip in there?  I don't know.  And it looks like the Bowling for Columbine cover.  But it's just a whole bunch of clips of people not behaving. 
[00:24:00]  No, it's people not behaving.  Wow.  Tech 9.  There's babies with guns.  And then it's me on the cover of Bowling for Columbine.  But why am I holding an orangutan?  It doesn't make sense.  He made it very racist.  Mine is more a white girl just getting smacked in the face by a black guy. 
[00:24:30]  Mine is more a political commentary.  Black on white crime.  L.A. gang.  L.A. gang.  Just wipe each other out.  Black on black crime.  Black on white crime.  Fucking behave.  How about you do that?  Oh, jeez.  Some of the images are a little rough, man.  Yeah.  It's a little rough.  I agree.  All right.  All right.  I agree.  Honestly, that's an old school Planet of the H clip right there.  Oh, my God.  Why am I shooting a Thompson? 
[00:25:00]  They just have no idea.  All these Chris Brown fans.  You see, this is who they were tweeting.  Fucking automatic weapons.  Do you understand?  You really could be one of these fucking gangbangers, even though you're not.  You made a left at one fork in the road instead of a right.  You could easily be in a Mexican-like gang, I think.  Yeah.  Could be, yeah.  Yeah.  You trim up the mustache a little bit.  I was just going to say that you trim the mustache a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think you could blend in if you had to. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  That's Bullying Before Behave on YouTube.  Oh, my God.  And it's the Kurt Love 666 YouTube channel.  Yeah.  The Kurt Love.  Kurt is with a K, by the way.  You know, the Drew Boogie version is great.  It's great.  It's just the song.  Right.  What a great song that is.  It is.  He did such a bang-up job with that one.  Somebody also made a video, which I came upon yesterday.  It's on YouTube.  That took, I guess, a legitimate ABC News thing from perhaps 60 Minutes. 
[00:26:00]  Not 60 Minutes, but it was one of those shows, Dateline, whatever it is, whatever's on ABC.  And it was about lone wolf kind of killers in our country.  You know, the usual suspects, the white loner kind of a guy.  And he used my YouTube clips that have been out there and spliced them into the newscast to make it look like they were absolutely talking about me. 
[00:26:30]  And it's hilarious.  It makes me look so bad.  It really is good.  I think it was called falling.  Oh, you could just put falling down, Anthony.  Anthony Cumia, falling down.  Yeah.  Yeah, that one right up top.  Bill, for all the warnings about and the money spent to prevent terrorism, law enforcement authorities say facts show the greater and more likely threat in this country comes from people like the suspect in this case. 
[00:27:00]  People known as lone wolves.  America has been plagued for decades of violence attributed to lone wolves.  Is there a doctor in the house?  The assassinations of the 1960s made household names of the men responsible.  And the number of men, mostly young, who have sought similar notoriety.  And I'm in there.  Seem to have increased every year since then.  With a Nazi helmet.  Up to this weekend's accused murderer.  I think we call them lone wolves because it's like they can't work in the pack. 
[00:27:30]  In other words, they can't work in society.  Swear to God, we were just talking about it.  I look up and right by my home, f*** the thousands of minorities.  So don't tell me what's imaginary.  It ain't whitey.  Tell them to behave.  Behave.  The lone wolf shooters almost kind of leave behind signals are now on the internet.  Video statements.  Singing with the gun?  Yeah, I'm singing in karaoke because I did gun karaoke, you know. 
[00:28:00]  But taken out of context.  People described him as basically not changing expression, looking at people.  Because he's not shooting human beings.  He's shooting things that have caused him pain and anger.  We call enforcement professionals and psychiatrists say another classic lone wolf trait involves sexual dysfunction.  Yeah, yeah, no, I had this fantasy when I was a kid that there was a naked woman.  Courtesy Norton and Friends.  I was this big and totally nude and, you know, with a little, little m*** and little t*** and everything. 
[00:28:30]  She was just a little, tiny woman.  And she was alive, you know.  And I would take her and just lick her and, like, put her in my mouth.  Jesus Christ.  And then, you know, that is, I would feel her whole body in my mouth.  I guarantee if they interviewed, like, a lot of serial killers, serial rapists, they would have a similar fantasy with everything.  Yeah, in this country, these lone wolves do pose a danger as great as the organized terrorists.  I think that maybe even more so just because they're here, they're in our communities. 
[00:29:00]  The suspect was easily and legally able to buy his weapon.  Every country has a single piece.  But not every country has such liberal gun laws.  What that means is that in order to lower the number of shootings and lethal shootings, whether they're mass shootings or not,  you have to do something to address the availability of guns.  Does the easy availability of weapons play a role here, do you think?  In my professional opinion, it doesn't.  Which is why the players in mass shootings should be remembered as rejects, losers, perverts. 
[00:29:30]  I'm alone in my movie theater eating popcorn.  That is a key message not just for the press, but it's a message for teachers, it's a message for neighborhoods,  and it's how we as a society eliminate something that's still in the world.  Xbox Kinect alone with a pistol on my hip.  He sadly calls distinctly American. 
[00:30:00]  There it is.  Anthony Comey.  That was very funny.  Falling down.  The guy that put that together did a great job.  Really good job.  Interweaving my psychotic videos into a real newscast.  Holy mother of God.  Bravo for that.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Speaking of guns, a story we didn't do yesterday was the guy who shot his fucking penis.  Ow.  What an idiot.  This was, we were so busy yesterday, we didn't get to this thing. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  This was the one thing we did want to do yesterday.  I bet it's the most important story in his life.  Of course.  A trip to the grocery store ended very badly for a Chandler man after he accidentally shot himself in the groin.  ABC 15's Corey Rangel is live in Chandler.  Corey, police calling this an accident.  But how did it happen?  Steve, police tell me the man had the gun tucked into his pants.  When it fired, it hit him squarely where it hurt the most.  Say penis.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Penis.  I don't really know what to say about that.  That's, wow.  Yeah.  I'm baffled right now.  What happened in this parking lot is hard for guys to even imagine.  Definitely makes me cringe.  Which, without a doubt, I mean, one man wouldn't.  Very painful.  Very, very, very, very painful.  Chandler police say a man accidentally shot his penis after tucking his girlfriend's pink pistol in the waistband of his pants.  And police tell me the bullet just didn't hit his groin.  The round went through his penis into his left leg and exited his left leg. 
[00:31:30]  The man had to be taken to the hospital for surgery.  But all of the guys I talk with took a shot at how careless they say the man was.  I think you should learn how to handle a gun a little better.  I mean, if you don't know what you're dealing with, then don't handle a gun.  You just can't, you know, you've got to be responsible.  So no sympathy for the guy?  I mean, like I said, I feel bad for the guy.  But at the same time, it's kind of his fault.  And police say this is a reminder that people should always treat guns as if they're loaded. 
[00:32:00]  And even though this was an accident, police say the man could face weapons charges.  Wow.  Jesus.  Got to be a little smarter with your gun, right?  Yeah.  It was her pink gun.  Her little pink pistol.  Yeah, he probably grabbed it, put his finger on the trigger, and went to shove it down his pants.  And then when your finger kind of, or the trigger, hit part of the pants, you don't do that. 
[00:32:30]  You use a holster.  It went right through his penis?  Right through his penis and right into his leg.  He's lucky he didn't die.  In a femoral artery, he gets hit.  You're done for.  You think it shot his mushroom head?  You think it was the mushroom head or it went through the shaft?  Maybe there's a big fucking divot in the crown now, on the underside of the crown.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it looks like a little Pac-Man mouth.  I'm laughing because Jimmy just tweeted, why is Andy Levy hating on Chris Brown, yo? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, you dick.  That's hilarious.  Yo.  Jimmy's looking for followers today.  No, I don't want to get mixed up in it.  Not because it just doesn't.  No.  It's already been done, but it's very funny.  They get so mad at Anthony's.  Oh, they do.  They get very angry.  Because we don't carry, man.  I don't want to be involved in this either.  I don't care about it.  No, I just don't care about their dumb fucking...  He's got fucking, yeah, a couple of million followers.  Four.  Four million. 
[00:33:30]  Who cares?  That's Anthony's fucking battle.  Nah, they don't even fucking...  They just...  They sit there and defend him.  Oh, Breezy.  Fucking Breezy.  Fuck Breezy.  I don't see hardcore gang members defending Chris Brown.  Nah, that's just it.  These are fucking all bitches.  They're all bitches.  They're these fat women that don't understand that he punched a woman in the face.  They should be the last ones defending him, obviously.  Yes!  Not to state the obvious, but...  Exactly my pernt. 
[00:34:00]  More importantly, there's breaking news right now.  Oh.  We're all over the place, but it sounds fun.  So fucking let's just continue.  French film star Gerard Depardieu.  Depardieu.  Depardieu.  Depardieu.  Two years of French, too, by the way.  Remember my Spanish rant yesterday?  Two years of French, and I can't even fucking count to ten.  Is he dead?  Relieves himself on airplane carpet before Paris-Doubling flight takes off.  What was he thinking?  I don't know, man.  Gerard Depardieu. 
[00:34:30]  Depardieu.  Was caught short on a Paris-Doubling flight and chose not to bother going to the toilet  before relieving himself.  What does was caught short mean?  Caught short?  Caught short?  I don't get that.  Oh, is it an English story?  I will only confirm that he, in effect, urinated in the plane, a spokeswoman for the Air France  flight said.  What an idiot.  Confirming a report.  Blah, blah, blah.  According to the passenger who was not named, the 62-year-old was visibly inebriated and 
[00:35:00]  tried to stand up before takeoff when passengers are asked to wear seatbelts, declaring, I  want to piss, I want to piss.  Oh, he had to take a leak, and you know, you got to wait until that plane takes off.  But I think it's a situation where you can't hold it in anymore.  Yeah.  That happens on this show when we do those marathon hour, hour and a half, two hour fucking,  you know, breaks.  Yeah.  You're hurting bad, man.  I've looked around for bottles and shit in this studio.  I didn't piss in a bottle.  When a stewardess asked him to sit and wait 15 minutes until the jet took off and reached 
[00:35:30]  cruising altitude, he said he could not wait, and there and then he stood up and did it  on the floor.  Wow.  Ah, he's embarrassed, man.  That's terrible.  He couldn't help himself.  Come on.  I wonder if he pissed his pants or took it out.  I would assume he just pissed his pants, because then this would be a whole other situation  if he fucking exposed himself.  If he pulled his dick out.  I think, oh, my dick, Depardieu said he could not wait, unzipped his trousers, and proceeded  to urinate on the carpet. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, you got a different version.  So he pulled out his French hog and just relieved himself on the plane.  That unclipped monster just falling out of his pants.  We could see he had been drinking, the stewardess said.  I wonder if he just knew he was going to piss his pants and was trying to...  How old is he?  62.  62.  I know that's a magerard Depardieu fanatic.  Dude, they were about to take off, and because he peed like that, they had to bring the plane  back so it could be cleaned.  Those people must have been pissed.  Yes and no. 
[00:36:30]  A celebrity just tinkled on the carpet.  That's almost worth being laid for.  That's a great story.  You got a story.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah, so he's...  I don't know.  What kind of trouble do you think he's in?  Sounds like he was desperate, so I wonder if they'll have leniency.  Oh, I'm sure they'll say, look, he's got blood.  Ladder problems.  Alcoholic.  Like we have.  No, ours are different.  They'll say, yeah, he'll get out of it, please. 
[00:37:00]  Every movie he's ever been in has sucked a dick.  He's terrible.  Fried Green Tomatoes.  Was he in that?  That looks great right there.  called My Father the Hero.  Yeah.  Gerard Depardieu.  He's water skiing behind a boat.  By Connor Peterson.  Wasn't he in Blaming on Rio?  I don't know.  I thought it was Michael Caine.  I think his big movie was like his first movie that came out was that one where he was Christopher  Columbus or some shit.  I don't know.  And he was supposed to be some big fucking actor. 
[00:37:30]  And then it just...  Yeah, but he did like nothing.  He's probably hugely famous in France for making films.  French films, I would imagine.  So it's Jerry Lewis.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we've all heard.  You're nothing until you make it in America, let's be honest with you.  Never heard from a French person that actually liked Jerry Lewis.  Really?  Yeah.  I think that's a myth.  I think Jerry Lewis made that up.  Yeah.  Why couldn't you?  Hey, I'm huge in Cambodia.  I'm saying it right now. 
[00:38:00]  Everyone is.  Did he retire from the MDA Telethon?  From the Telethon?  Yeah, I think this is going to be the first year he's not involved in the Telethon.  Or they pushed him out.  I get the impression that they didn't want him anymore, yeah.  But they need a young go-getter.  They do need a young person to kind of fucking put a spark in that thing.  Because, wow, is that just about a dull piece of shit.  Fuck.  I mean, you know, if you want a good cause and everything, that's fine. 
[00:38:30]  But to get Jerry Lewis out there, geef.  Have they done anything to cure muscular dystrophy?  They do a Telethon every year.  They've made some progress.  A little progress here and there, but I think they all realize, wow, this is a doozy.  This one's not an easy one.  We were talking about how they just got better chairs and stuff.  Yeah, we used to do that.  They figured all that shit out.  Yeah, remember?  Better wheelchairs and shit.  Old days.  Do you know, I Twittered last night what I was listening to and howling. 
[00:39:00]  Was the Homeless Charlie audio.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody had tweeted and said it was available.  I was fucking howling listening to that again.  There's absolutely no reason we should not be able to play that.  Yeah.  It's not like that's dangerous audio.  It literally just points out how stupid they were to react to it.  The whole thing, yeah.  I'm more than willing to have a relationship with management if they just do these easy  things.  Like Jimmy said, that's a no-brainer. 
[00:39:30]  Just get it done for us and then maybe we'll respect you a little more.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, because it's ridiculous we can't replace something that is already out there.  He was a funny fucking dude, man.  I know he was.  He was a funny dude.  There was one line and the prior call was right.  He had that cadence.  And he was a homeless guy and he just got how to be mean and funny.  Like he was being funny.  He wasn't, he didn't want to rape anybody.  He was just being comical.  He was a fan of the show.  He knew what the show.  He was, from back in the NEW days, he was to listen. 
[00:40:00]  And there was one line where you said, what do you do for money, Charlie?  And what did he say?  Ah, collect cans, mug old bitches.  And he fucking, I was fucking howling.  And I think someone followed it up with, what do you mug him, you punch him?  And he said something about, ah, hook that bitch like Mike Tyson.  I was fucking loving homeless Charlie.  I don't fucking care who he offended.  He was a riot. 
[00:40:30]  I got to listen to that.  It is online, yeah.  Yes.  And it went around yesterday.  Very, very enjoyable.  I didn't retweet it because, you know, they're watching us.  That's what sucks about having Twitter.  Other people watch you.  Look out.  So it's out there if you know the right people.  I encourage people to listen to it because it shows us how stupid they were to get, A,  offended by it.  Why don't we play it right now?  What kind of trouble could we get in?  I don't know.  I wouldn't play it.  I don't know.  They get mad. 
[00:41:00]  Tell the guys down the hall, whoever they are, whatever their names are.  I want to play it, but I wouldn't.  So fucking ask them again.  Just keep asking them.  Oh, boy, that keep asking thing once a week.  But today's Wednesday, so you've got to make an appointment for, like, Thursday.  Thursday could be keep asking for the homeless Charlie bed.  Good point.  But Wednesday is ask for a raise day.  Good fucking point.  Hold on a second.  Mm-hmm.  It's ask for a raise Wednesday. 
[00:41:30]  Wednesday.  You know why he's here, bitch.  He remembers Cape Cod and driving six hours to get back from work Monday morning.  He even had to get a discount on a shitty engagement ring from one of our sponsors because he couldn't afford one at full price.  Take this job and shut it.  If you're not going to pay him, he's packing his bags and hitting the bricks.  You can't fire him because he's quitting.  Sayonara.  Adios.  Out the door.  Out the door.  Gone forever.  So long.  Measly paycheck.  It's time to show Sam Roberts the money.  Show me the money! 
[00:42:00]  I see Sam's not happy.  What's the problem, Sam?  Come on, Sam.  Well, I said this before.  The engagement ring wasn't shitty.  That's funny.  That just insults the ring you gave him.  I think even I hate Steven Singer would appreciate that they're calling his ring shitty.  Well, he would appreciate it.  No, because he understands the show and how radio works.  Right.  Right.  You pump shit up.  It wasn't shitty.  Steven Singer should fucking run this channel.  He understands the show and he understands radio in general. 
[00:42:30]  Understands self-deprecation.  Unlike somebody that will remain nameless.  Are you disassociating yourself from this bit, Sam Roberts?  I wasn't associated with it from the beginning.  I didn't have much to do with it.  Wow, that is a good answer.  Ever.  What, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Just a Twitter at mention it.  Yeah.  What was it?  I'd rather not read it.  Did you see the flowers are still here from the gay wedding?  Are they?  That was a nice celebration yesterday.  How'd that come off? 
[00:43:00]  Good?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Big success?  Oh, definitely.  Frank DiCaro.  Continued success.  That was your raise, sir.  I don't think, again, I don't think it came from the same.  I bet there was $10,000 spent on that money.  On that wedding, excuse me.  That was more expensive.  That was more like a promotions thing than a programming.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  Was there any media here?  I mean, it was, you know, I'm sure they put out press releases.  Ronnie said it was the first gay wedding ever done on the radio.  I think so. 
[00:43:30]  I think that was the purpose.  Yeah, so you had to think the press would be here or something.  Yeah.  I mean, there were a lot of people here, but they might have been invited guests.  I don't know.  They probably were.  Yeah.  I wasn't invited.  So are you asking for a raise today or what, man?  I mean, I don't know what the day holds.  Oh, boy.  They got to you.  Nobody.  I mean, nobody got to me.  Don't ever allow these people to get to you.  Yeah, what happened?  You're still coming up in this business.  Don't do it.  Nobody's got.  You're at a crossroad right now.  Don't go down the I, they got me road.  Nobody got me. 
[00:44:00]  You stay strong, sir.  How do you think it'll go today when you go back there?  Well, I don't know what will happen today.  I don't know if I'll go back there.  I don't know who knows.  You got to go back there.  It's Wednesday.  Then they told you every week.  I mean, I didn't do it last Wednesday, so.  Then you should fucking do it twice this week.  We made it Wednesday.  They said once a week.  Well, I mean, it was just suggestions were thrown around.  They were hoping for Sunday.  We're not here.  Wow, man.  You're not helping this bit. 
[00:44:30]  That's a shame.  We thought you would have input on this.  This is your future, not ours.  How come you thought I would have input on the bit?  Because you need a raise.  Yeah, but I told you a hundred times I wasn't going to support it.  See, they got to him.  Well, no, I think this has been my position for a while.  This is a sad day.  Position.  Your position is fucking doggy style.  That's right.  Get the fuck in the ass.  That's your position, my friend.  Until you think about that.  I just, I'm still, I can't believe this, uh, Catch a Predator stuff.  What? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, fuck.  That was the first story we did.  I know.  That's 45 minutes ago.  But we didn't really touch on it because we ended up talking about the breezy stuff.  And then.  Are you going to get a raise?  I would think so at some point in my life.  Holy shit.  Enough already.  You're not young.  No, you're getting older every day.  Well, I mean.  That works.  27.  Still time.  Your mommy might think you're still a kid, but, uh, you're, you're a grown man that needs  to get, get some gumption and get, uh, get over there and, and, and ask for your fucking 
[00:45:30]  comeuppance.  Your, your due.  You need a raise before you get married.  Yeah.  And you're getting married in less than a year, right?  That's right.  Shit.  So you need that raise before you get married.  Yes, he does.  You want to hock that fucking ring?  No, it's shitty.  I can't get anything for it.  I forgot about the promo, right?  Right.  The shitty ring.  That was a great production piece.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Sanctioned by the production, uh, team here at SiriusXM, by the way.  It wasn't official.  I mean, there were inaccuracies, but it was an official SiriusXM production piece. 
[00:46:00]  Pretty accurate to me.  Mm-hmm.  You fucking just saying, look, raise or gonzo, out of here.  Yeah, I never agreed to those.  I like your fucking, I like that, that ballsy, that's the ballsy Sam I like.  You like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not this guy.  You don't like this guy.  This whining fucking mess that's just sitting here saying, oh, I'm not whining.  Okay.  Management did, you know, pull me aside and said that this is not good for Sam, that we  do this every week.  I think that's probably right.  But then I said, look, Sam has nothing to do with this. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  They say it makes you look bad, which I don't understand at all.  But we know what's best.  Right.  We've always known in our careers what has been best, and it's rarely what management  says.  Yeah.  So you should just take that cue from us and know that to go down there and ask for that  raise every week is what you really have to do, regardless of what they serve.  It's true.  And talk about it on the air, like this, like we're doing.  I'm going to think really hard right now.  Last time management made me or the show better. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  Me or the show better.  Management.  Me or the show better.  I'm trying to think back to like maybe something Brucey Mittman did, but.  You're going back that far, huh?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Sam's on the light.  He's getting the lights.  Notice we didn't use the lights yesterday when Pauly D was in here.  No.  I forgot we had them.  Because that's another, as the kids like to say, epic fail. 
[00:47:30]  Well, you know what?  That's an epic fail.  Can you turn them off?  I can't see.  That is a bright ass light.  Turn them off.  Turn them off.  But.  Notice we didn't turn those lights on for all our pictures.  For our pictures.  That would have been good.  We took a lot of pictures yesterday.  We have had the team in here trying to figure out things.  We're going to dim the lights and we got some new gels for them that hopefully  will more closely match the spotlights and then we can just kind of nicely flood the  room with this light and not be so. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to flood it with fucking Zyklon B because we're just fucked here anyway.  Jesus.  Well, see, that's why I worry that some of your advice comes from a self-destructive place.  Does it?  Yeah.  We've never been self-destructive.  It's always worked out in the end.  Up, up, up.  Up and down.  We've never been self-destructive.  The same one.  Well, I mean.  It's always worked out.  Yeah, but that's.  Always.  I don't think that there's always been an.  And every time we got fired, it made us more famous. 
[00:48:30]  A game plan?  Yeah, I don't think that you got fired always with the end game of this is where this ends  up.  We purposely got fired in Boston knowing that we were going to become bigger and make more  money.  That's a fact.  We finally admit that.  And even the Sex with Sam thing made us way more bigger.  Yeah, but at the time, that's not how you felt.  We didn't have a worry in the world when we got fired from there.  We knew.  That's right.  We had another gig in two years.  That's right.  All those tears were. 
[00:49:00]  That's right.  Yeah, I have a bunch of pants that fit me that Opie wore during that time.  All right, let's.  Oh, were those the ones that he shit in during the time we were fired?  The holes cut in the back?  As I'm in.  Whoa, why do we always have to make a game?  As I'm on the fucking phone with every relative I have lying my ass off telling them how everything's  going to be fine.  Oh, great.  I may have gone through an anorexic stage there, Sam.  Is that what you're getting at?  That is, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  And to me, somebody who is like.  I can't imagine that my jeans today could actually fit you.  And you've gained weight.  I'd certainly need a belt.  Oh.  She just called you fat.  I don't.  I mean, I'm in pretty good shape, I think.  Not in good shape.  I think I got down.  You're not in good shape.  I got down to a 30.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, maybe it was a tough time.  Travis and me fight for your old jeans.  Yeah, I can't even imagine that.  I used to fit in jeans you guys wear.  That's crazy.  So, you know, I don't.  Travis is no fucking rail anymore, either. 
[00:50:00]  No, I don't think Travis could still fit in.  Oh, boy.  Travis has gained more weight than me.  Again, this place just fucking chews you apart.  We're talking about a guy that only weighs 135 pounds, I bet.  140.  Travis weighs more than that.  Not anymore.  No way.  How much does he weigh?  Let me tell you something.  How much do you weigh, Sam?  Let me tell you something.  I probably weigh between 135 and 140.  So, Travis.  Probably 135-ish.  All right, he's walking down the hall.  I'm going to get this right.  He becomes all fatty now. 
[00:50:30]  Exactly.  Let's see.  Size him up.  Size him up.  He's wearing a loose tee.  Yeah, but by the way, that's a different t-shirt size than he used to wear.  I'm putting him at 148.  I'm going to go 152.  All right.  Hold on.  140.  All right.  I put you at 148.  Yeah, probably.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wait, I said 152.  You can't just say probably.  Look at the scales coming out.  Well, it could be around there, too.  The scales coming out.  The scales coming out.  It's been a while.  How much did you weigh when you started with the show?  Oh, no.  Shh.  E-Rock.  No.  No.  Don't run. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, the scale comes out.  He gets so scared.  It's like on Fourth of July, the fireworks, when they scare the dog.  It's like when a mouse comes in the room.  Yeah.  I was about 127.  Wow.  And now you're about 150?  About 150, yeah.  Damn.  Have a pair of your jeans if you want them.  I didn't want them back.  Here, open them up.  Are those, uh...  Oh, well.  Those are a little slender right there. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, but...  Oh, my.  These are 31s.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  There you go.  All right.  Dude, I have some problems.  I could never wear those.  Holy shit.  I guess step up on the scale.  Let me take my shoesies off.  Let's give a...  Well, the jeans were fashionable at the time, though, Jimmy.  Of course.  Not bad.  They're just skinny.  No, but they weren't tight on me.  That's the scary part.  Here we go.  I'm at 139 with shoes on.  139.  So 135.  152. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  152.  That's what I said.  Wow.  I said 152.  Right there.  I said 152.  You said 147.  I said 152.  And you were what when you came here?  Uh, like 127.  127?  Wow.  Wow.  But I still fit in Opie's jeans.  Wait, I'm only, like, 14 pounds heavier than you?  I guess.  Wow.  Look, those baggy t-shirts, am I wrong, Travis?  You didn't used to be that size.  No, these are mediums.  I used to wear smalls.  Right.  Aw.  Are you bummed? 
[00:52:30]  Huh?  You bummed?  Uh, no.  Not that much.  I mean, you know, whatever.  All right, T-Rock.  Oh, no.  We're asking if a guy's bummed that he went from small to medium.  I will say this, obviously.  Half our audience are on double XLs.  Obviously, Travis carries it well.  You guys didn't know how heavy he was.  That is true.  Yeah, look, I've gone from a 30 to a 31 waist.  I'm not, you know.  Say it, it's not yet.  But you're all muffin topping.  Yes.  So that's all we're going to do about Sam's raise today?  I thought we were talking about weight. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  We were.  I didn't forget.  We were.  We're trying to take care of you, Sam.  But like Travis's weight, your pay should also go up.  What about Travis's pay?  But his pay weighted as well.  Yes, your pay is weighting.  W-A-I-T.  The weight.  Are you hoping to get a raise before you get married?  Oh, boy.  I remember when I was hoping to get a raise before I got married.  Oh, and how long have you been married?  Four years.  Oh.  Four years?  You haven't had a raise in four years? 
[00:53:30]  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Have you ever gotten a raise in four years?  Oh, boy.  We're going to be podcasting.  In this building?  Oh, this is horrible.  No.  But when XM first started, we were with him?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  How does a company justify that?  I don't know, but.  Whatever.  I don't feel like getting in trouble today.  With the books.  Whatever.  When they look at the fucking books and go, woo-hoo, that's how they justify it.  Four years?  There you can see how skinny I used to be.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, look at that.  It's John Locke.  It's not that much different.  Sure.  In the face? 
[00:54:00]  Sure.  Yeah, in the face it is.  I could see there's a very slender, boyish, twinkish looking, lovely, innocent face.  John, like 25 there.  Obviously, Travis has been eating out of depression because he hasn't gotten a raise.  Yeah.  We need some production pieces for Travis.  Wait a minute.  You're trying to make something out of nothing.  I see what you're doing.  No, no, no, no.  This is all about you, Sam.  I feel bad for Travis.  I'm fine.  Don't worry about me.  You worry about yourself.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Well, we should break.  We got a busy show.  We got Keith Robinson finally coming in.  Keith's coming in.  Finally.  It's been a while.  It has been a while.  And Jerry Springer, he's got a new show?  I guess.  Is anyone going to give a shit about this show?  It's his game show.  I think it's going to the next level.  Yeah?  He's had the show.  Did anyone watch it?  He did?  No, no, no.  Nobody watched it.  What?  And that's why he's coming in.  He needs our help.  Oh, shit.  What's the game show?  Where are we at?  Does he need our help?  Or is he stopping by to say hi?  He's just stopping by to say hi, but his show is Baggage on the Game Show Network. 
[00:55:00]  And the special is called Baggage First Dates, which is on this Sunday at 8 p.m.  Oh, shit.  That couldn't have been a worse promotion.  Baggage.  Baggage First Dates.  It's like a special.  It's like Baggage has been so successful.  I want to know what the gist of this game is.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, he came in and promoted it.  And I remember walking away going, ah, I'm not going to watch that.  Maybe you'll watch Baggage First Dates. 
[00:55:30]  What is this show?  You just said it, and I don't even know what it is.  It's on Sunday at 8 p.m.  What do you do on this show?  Yeah, it's not like, let's say, you know, something like Wheel of Fortune.  You know that it's a Wheel of Fortune.  Yeah.  What is it?  Baggage.  I don't know what that is.  You got to put, you got to.  Oh, Jerry just said something.  Oh, I would tell you what it is, but Jerry's on his way up.  So stay tuned.  You'll find out what Baggage is all about after this.  No. 
[00:56:00]  That's not what we do.  That's not what we do.  That was a nice little tease.  I'm trying to learn.  It's what me and Jimmy never do with our dicks.  Bag them.  Baggage.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, quit sucking them.  Can we keep Jerry in here for 15 minutes today?  He's on the clock.  Yeah, it's a very busy schedule.  Jerry's on the clock today.  So do we.  Let's make it official.  You could keep him in for longer if you want, but 15 minutes would be fine.  Tops.  You talk about him at the talk show, about his time on America's Got Talent. 
[00:56:30]  We did all that.  I know you did.  So this is a 10-minute interview of Tops.  It's gone down to 10.  Yeah.  About the game show.  About this game show baggage that no one's going to watch.  So you're only going to talk about Baggage First Dates for 10 minutes.  Then that's the end.  Well, right.  He likes politics, too.  So maybe we can talk politics with him a little bit.  Maybe he's on Team Breezy.  See what he thinks of Michelle Bachman.  Be interested to hear his take on the economy.  Right.  Yes, that, too.  The Elvis clip from Michelle Bachman.  We will get to it.  Do she chill?  Extremely. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  And Linda Hogan saying, basically saying Hulk is gay now.  Well, she's made claims that multiple wrestlers are now gay.  But it says on this, Linda Hogan says Hulk is gay.  That's one of them.  Yeah.  She's saying that, implying.  But Hulk was saying that Linda Hogan, no, no, no, the Ultimate Warrior was saying that  Hulk would take, well, her around to fuck the other wrestlers.  But they're gay?  Linda's also heard some rumors about the Ultimate Warrior.  Oh, no. 
[00:57:30]  Did we go easy on Linda Hogan?  I think this sounds like.  We might have went easy on her.  What is she doing?  She got the really nice house.  She's fine.  She was married to a gay guy for so long.  And she's got a young fucking boyfriend.  What is she doing?  What do these boys do?  Well, I mean, she also, in her book, she takes claim for inventing Hulk Hogan's bandana  and ripped up t-shirt.  She has, it's everything.  It's Linda.  I, uh.  Yeah.  Without mentioning names, I just listened to a dude's divorce story yesterday. 
[00:58:00]  It's inferior.  Horrible, right?  Hulk?  His ex is in a really nice house somewhere that this guy bought.  Bought, basically, because of how successful he is.  And she's in the really nice house.  And this guy is in maybe a one bedroom.  Did he have a gay relationship with Brutus the Barber Beefcake?  Is that what she's saying?  Brutus the Barber Beefcake. 
[00:58:30]  I hear one time, Linda, Hulk said something and she couldn't hear him.  So she made a hand motion in a circle and then cupped her ear.  And Hulk went, could I use that?  Right.  As a matter of fact, Linda said, you should start calling your muscles pythons.  Pythons.  Oh, really?  Right, yeah.  And he goes, but I usually call my boyfriends cocks pythons.  Right.  Because they're all so big.  You know him.  Brutus the Barber Beefcake.  I can't wait to get to this audio.  Can we blow off the Jerry Springer interview so we can do this? 
[00:59:00]  This sounds way more interesting than Jerry Springer.  If I have to hear that the ass man was gay, I am really going to be pissed off.  Because that guy was all man.  His song proved it, by the way.  Him and the honky tonk man were together.  The honky tonk man?  No fucking way.  That's right.  Yeah, the honky tonk.  I would imagine.  Hulk kissing somebody.  You think honky tonk was gay?  I don't want to say that because I...  You heard rumors, though.  I would have my suspicions with him.  Who's Hulk kissing there?  Huh? 
[00:59:30]  His boyfriend.  That's not his boyfriend.  One of his boyfriends, obviously.  I wonder if him and Jimmy Hart had anything going on.  Oh.  The Hart Foundation.  I remember them.  Yeah.  That explains the hair loss with Hulk Hogan, huh?  Gay guys lose hair?  Well, when he's down on his knees, you know, people are rubbing his head.  There's video right there proving.  Yeah, that's what I would say.  Animated gif from WrestleMania VI.  You even know what WrestleMania? 
[01:00:00]  Oh, of course you do.  Do I know what WrestleMania Hogan and Warrior were at?  Yes.  You don't deserve a raise.  I never knew they fought until you just said that.  What?  I never knew that they ever fought.  Nope.  Oh, my God.  This was a legendary match.  That's hilarious.  The longer it goes on, the funnier it is.  I love the ref that just keeps moving back.  Yeah.  He doesn't know what to do.  It's a short loop.  And the Warrior's head is just rocking back and forth right in front of Hulk's dick.  It's out of context.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a legendary match.  Legendary. 
[01:00:30]  Legendary.  Sam, this is what we're going to do.  Pull the curtains and turn the lights off.  So when Jerry Springer walks by, he thinks we're not here today.  Because I'd rather do this.  And we don't play the audio outside the studio anymore, so he won't know.  Jerry's here.  I want to make them knock on the door.  Hello?  Is anybody here?  Yeah, let's do that.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I'm going to shut the curtains.  Uh-huh.  So.  Oh, boy.  Roll says he has a hard out at 7.50, so if we want more time, we need a break now. 
[01:01:00]  Tell him we heard.  I know what you're doing.  Tell him we heard.  That's not information.  We heard the hard out was at 7.15.  Yeah, tell him we have a hard out at 7.15.  He's got everything around that.  We have a hard out.  We have a hard out at 7.15, so he better get his ass in here for his four-minute interview.  I just got a text from Roland.  Oh.  Is Jerry listening to this whole thing?  Oh, you're not.  It's 7.06.  He just said, Jerry is I apostrophe N my office. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that's fine.  I apostrophe N.  Roland is a dolt.  Yeah, there's no apostrophe in N. You're not combining two words.  I apostrophe.  Like idiot and ninny, which would be perfect for you to combine Roland.  Yesterday's segment had everybody accusing Roland of lying yesterday.  I got a call from one of the other talent bookers asking me to verify one of Roland's stories  because nobody believes him because Joel McHale kept calling him a liar.  He really is.  I've been warning Roland about this for a long fucking time.  Falling into that Casey Anthony thing. 
[01:02:00]  I've been warning him.  He is a lying sack of shit.  No, the baby was here.  I was holding her.  She's gone.  I haven't seen her.  She's trying to the pool.  John in the pool.  Where's your baby?  I love Roland's cat noise.  It's the best.  Although Jimmy's is really good now, too.  We got a break if we're going to get Jerry in here. 
[01:02:30]  I just wanted to bring up the fact that Roland, when he talked about the red eye, you know,  Joel McHale taking the red eye, and then he even said it.  He goes, well, no, he said that he could come in at such and such a time, so I just thought  I thought he was taking the red eye.  And that was when he absolutely fessed up to lying.  So maybe Roland assumes and doesn't lie. 
[01:03:00]  Maybe he's just a big assumer.  He doesn't lie all the time.  That stage collapse video is just horrific.  Come on, America, guys.  Do it now.  Holy shit.  All right.  Well, but the point being, another guy that I know went through a divorce and lost everything  when he was the guy that was able to get that house in.  That's how it works.  How is that fucking legal?  And believe it or not, I do understand taking care of an ex-wife and stuff after you. 
[01:03:30]  I understand.  Fuck them.  You don't want to throw them on the street with nothing.  I would have loved to.  Well, I guess case by case basis, fair enough.  But to take it to the point where the wife gets the house where the guy was able to afford  that house because of what he does is just insane.  And now that guy's living in a one bedroom.  How is that fair?  Look at the guy from fucking the stupid housewife show, right?  Yeah, we'll talk about that. 
[01:04:00]  They were going through a divorce and broke and shit.  Yeah, but he was fucking Dino Bravo.  Who?  So the guy from Desperate...  Dino Bravo!  From Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a rumor, I heard.  Dino Bravo.  Wow.  Linda McMahon.  I mean, Linda McMahon.  Linda Hogan coming out with that one?  Yep.  Linda Hogan told me.  That's a shame.  Yeah, we'll talk about that as well.  It's just ridiculous.  Oh, man.  And then how did the ex-wives live with themselves knowing that they just completely fucked over 
[01:04:30]  a human being?  They don't look at it that way.  They don't feel that way.  They feel they didn't get enough.  It's like the government.  That's great.  Jesus Christ.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  We're going to figure this out.  Jerry Springer is going to come in here for a very quick interview.  Extremely quick.  What?  We have him until 7.  Yeah, he's good for a while.  Well, we got things to do.  Tell Jerry right now we got things to do.  So what?  We're still at 10 or 15?  Was he just live with Imus?  Who?  Before?  Springer?  He already did Imus? 
[01:05:00]  Well, I think he might have.  So we'll-  Probably.  Isn't he right across?  So let's play the clips from Imus' interview with him.  Yeah.  You don't like taking second guest?  Oh, we love Jerry.  We're going to have him in here next, and we're going to have a good time.  Of course we are.  And then we're going to do the Linda Hogan audio.  And then we got Keith Robinson coming in.  Oh, my God.  We got to talk about the situation.  And we got to talk about Michelle Bachman.  What a show.  And campaign.  And campaign.  Oh, we get that clip yet?  We're working on it.  Yo, campaign.  All right.  That's a very good clip as well. 
[01:05:30]  Chop, chop.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get.  Star of Showgirls and Saved by the Bell.  Actress and author, Elizabeth Berkley. 
[01:06:00]  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Elizabeth Berkley.  Elizabeth, do you have an iPod?  Yes, I do.  Thank you so much for your time.  That's really all you needed to know?  Yes.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The following is a public service announcement  from Anthony Cumia,  founder of the National Transgender Advocacy Coalition.  Yes, I have both male and female genitalia,  but I consider myself a female.  It's just a little bit of a penis  and really doesn't interfere much with my life. 
[01:06:30]  The reason I haven't talked about it  is it's not a big deal to me.  Like, come on.  It's not like we all go around  talking about our vag.  I think this is a great opportunity  to make other multiple-gendered people  feel more comfortable with their bodies.  I'm sexy.  I'm hot.  I have both a poon and a peener.  Big fucking deal.  If you or someone you love is transgendered,  call the Opie and Anthony Show  on the number listed on your radio  and describe your delicious appendage  to one of our intern call screeners. 
[01:07:00]  good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  And your good boy phone  Good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone  You good boy phone is when you're home  With the old crow 
[01:07:30]  And your naughty boy phone  Is when nobody's home  And that little fucking whore from Canada blows up your phone  It's your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone  Your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone  I like the naughty boy phone 
[01:08:00]  The virus  Sirius XM  This is the OVN3 show  Jerry Springer entering the studio  Jerry  Jerry Springer entering the studio  Hey, hey, hey  Jerry  Hey  Don't get up 
[01:08:30]  Look how stride he is  He goes, don't get up  Good morning, Jerry  How are you, sir?  Jerry must be doing some TV today  God damn, you look good, sir  I know  Thank you  I gotta get back at night  You're not aging anymore, huh?  Pardon?  You're not aging anymore  I know  You look younger and younger  You do look very slender  Really?  I'm wearing bigger suits  Oh, that works  Is that how that works?  That does work  Honestly, you buy a bigger suit  Everyone says  Does that work well?  You got a full head of hair, though, Jerry  I've always had a full head of hair, I think 
[01:09:00]  You're not losing any of it  I think  No, that's true  Well, at this age, if you haven't lost your hair by now  You don't  Yeah, you're probably good  67  Yeah  You're 67?  Yeah  Fuck  I'll be 68 if I behave  Nice  You know who else is 60?  Oh, De Niro's 68 today  68  Today  God, is he old  It's his birthday and Elvis yesterday  Well, yeah, that was a good one  We were saying  Elvis' birthday  That's unbelievable  Unbelievable  Well, I mean, obviously people 
[01:09:30]  But to just keep saying this over and over  It's his birthday, it's his birthday  Does no one brief her?  I know  That's what we said  Her people didn't realize this was  You know, there was a mistake there about to happen  She sounded like  No, no, I did not  Can we play it in front of you, Jerry?  And then we'll get into, you know, baggage and all that?  Yes, I won't  I heard about it, but I didn't hear the clip  Because you like talking politics  I love talking about it  Please play it  Is that your guy?  Is he going to beat us up?  No  Yes 
[01:10:00]  Who is that guy?  I don't know  Where?  Behind you, Jerry  Oh, oh, oh, yeah  Is that your security guy?  I'm saying that's Chuck Dodd  How long have you been hanging out with John McCain?  Yeah, he's  He looks like McCain  That guy  Is he mad at us?  That is  No, he just  He looks like that  He's just  Thumbs up  Yeah  All right  Thumbs up  Yeah  Oh, look, our guy's coming now, though  Yeah  There it is  You guys are in trouble now  Is he mad at us?  Not at all  He's a lovely man  That guy's intense, Jerry  Kenny, who's that guy? 
[01:10:30]  Which one?  He's  That's Jerry's guy  He's with Virginia  That's my publicity there  Yeah  All right, here we go  Here's the Michelle Bachman clip  Yes  This is unbelievable  Before we get started  Let's all say happy birthday to Elvis Presley today  Really?  Happy birthday  We paid you a little bit of promised land when we pulled up  You can't do better than Elvis Presley  We thought we'd celebrate his birthday  As we get started the celebrating 
[01:11:00]  Take our country back to her  These politicians can't talk off script ever  No, it's just  Yeah, first of all  Can you imagine having to listen to that voice  That news  I thought Hillary was bad with that voice  It's obviously not a major issue in terms of who should be president  But just on the side note  Listening to that for four years  Yeah  It's the anniversary of his death, not his birthday  Yes, yes 
[01:11:30]  He was born on January 8, 1935  Tupelo, Mississippi  I think it's a major issue  I think if you're going to be the president of the United States  You've got to know  You can't fuck up things like that  Yeah, but what it is  Is it's phoniness  That's what it says  It doesn't matter  The fact situation is not  Is that obviously this is not significant to her  Because otherwise she would know  She would know  So don't talk about things that  Right  You know  So she pulls up  Full of like  This means so much to me  Look, I'm playing the music 
[01:12:00]  We've got to celebrate  It's like  She's totally insincere  Yeah  She doesn't mean it  She thinks we're all stupid  Right  If she mentions that  We're going to really like her  Because she understands us  Yeah  Do you think that that's the audio version  Of Mike Dukakis  In the helmet  In the tank  Yeah, that was a good one  Yeah, but she's not going to get that far  I mean, she may be a lovely lady  I'm not here beating her up  I'm just saying  There's no way she gets the nomination  The Republicans know  She cannot get the nomination  Unless Democrats keep contributing to her 
[01:12:30]  To have her as the opponent  Yeah  What bothers me is  The media takes this very seriously  Like she's an actual candidate  It's like  Why don't you just call her  Just call her out  Please  Do you think that's why though  Like her and Palin  Because they know that  They're really not electable  So the media probably pushes them  Because you kind of want  Shitty candidates  If you don't want the Republicans to win  And neither one of those  I think are great candidates  Yeah  Well, they're not going to  They're not going to get the nomination  No  What do you think of Perry  Stepping in there  And  He can't talk either, man  Well, yeah, but  He could be the candidate 
[01:13:00]  He could be  Yeah, I think right now  It's between him and Romney  Yeah  So he could be the candidate  Because  Other than what he might say  From time to time  The fact is  He's the governor of Texas  So he brings political clout with him  Right  So, you know, that has nothing to do with  Whether he'd be a good president  What his competence is  But he is a viable candidate from day one  Which is why  Just by announcing  He's all of a sudden  Near the top of the polls  Yeah, yeah  The polls are really  You know  Favoring him now  How conservative is he  Compared to Romney 
[01:13:30]  Oh, he's more conservative than Romney  Oh, is he?  Yeah  Well, Romney's not conservative  He's got to play conservative now  Because  He's trying to get the Republican nomination  But it's his health care bill  In Massachusetts  Which has become  What they now call Obamacare  And he's trying to distance himself  Yeah, it was Romney care  Which is absurd  It's the same  Yeah  It's the same thing  And why he's running from it  Is crazy  Because the fact is  Massachusetts is the one state  Where they have almost  Universal health insurance  I mean, that's amazing 
[01:14:00]  Virtually everybody in Massachusetts  Has health insurance because of that  Why is that a bad thing?  Why aren't we celebrating it?  And Massachusetts  Has much less unemployment  Than Texas  Then why did Ted  Why did Ted leave Massachusetts  To have his brain cancer treated?  Just wondering  If it's such good health care  Oh boy  Oh God  Oh my God  Where's Ted come from? 
[01:14:30]  I'm just  Because I  I don't agree with universal health care  But I mean, why Ted though?  Well, he  First of all  They had their own private insurance  So they didn't need that  Ah  That's always good  Isn't that great  When Congress can just do  Whatever they want  And talk about how great it is  For the people  That they come up with this stuff  But then their set of rules  Are totally different  I love that part  I don't mind  I don't mind that  As long as they make sure  Everyone else has health insurance  See, that's what was great  About Kennedy  They could afford everything  But they recognize it 
[01:15:00]  Recognize that millions  And millions of Americans  Cannot afford health insurance  And, you know  Lower income people  Or middle income people  Love their children  As much as rich people do  So they ought to be able  To get health insurance as well  And so I think it's wonderful  That everyone has health insurance  I mean, why?  If you love America  How can you not love the idea  That everyone should be able  To take care of their family?  Ideologically, it sounds great  Financially, it's a boondoggle  It's a disaster  Because the government  Has never been able 
[01:15:30]  To run a program  And have it work  And be profitable  And not have so much  It shouldn't be profitable  Social security?  I don't mean profitable  Your grandparents or parents  Don't like social security?  My gosh  Social security is run by the government  And since 1933  It's been a saving grace  For millions and millions of people  Government wants a lot of things  That are okay  Let me give you 20 things  That didn't work  And don't work financially  That the government is in charge of  The government's never been trusted 
[01:16:00]  With our money  Because they've  We are the government  They show  No, unfortunately we're not  We're not a good representation  Of the government  The government does not represent  The people anymore  Well, I agree  Politicians don't necessarily  Represent the people  But frankly  I don't mind having  A national defense  I don't mind having  Government make sure  That when we go to restaurants  The food is clean  Sure, sure  I don't mind government  Coming when there's  A fire at my home  When should they  Then step out of your ass  Though  I want government  To provide services 
[01:16:30]  That people can't provide  For themselves  That's what government  Should do  I don't know why  We've suddenly  Hate everything  That  You know  For example  This is what you hear  Politicians now saying  Everybody's saying  Government doesn't  Create jobs  Okay  Let me tell you something  Every single penny  That the government  Spends  Is to employ  Somebody  Every  So when you say  You want jobs  And government  Doesn't provide jobs  Every penny 
[01:17:00]  That the government  Spends  Is employing someone  It may be  Someone in the  Defense  Industry  It may be a police officer  It may be a teacher  But every single penny  Is to employ people  So why don't we get off  This notion  That the government  Doesn't provide jobs  You know what  If you did away  With all the jobs  That a government  That a tax dollar  Is paying  You would have  Millions and millions 
[01:17:30]  And millions  Of more people  Not employed  When do you think  Jay raised a good point  Too about how we think  That everything in the  Government is bad  And I've been wondering  This  When did  Everything with government  Become negative  In the public  Because we trust  Nobody  I mean was it  The Kennedy assassination  Like what happened  Where everybody  In the government  Is seen as  Untrustworthy  Watergate didn't help  Yeah I'm sure  That was a big  It's a confluence  Of behavior  As well as  The rise of the media  And the fact  That it's 24-7  And the fact is 
[01:18:00]  We now know  More things about  People than we  Ever did before  So it's not just  Government  All institutions  Are now  Less credible  Because we realize  That all these  Heroes that we've  Set up  Were set up  In an age  Where you really  Didn't see the  Blemishes  There was no one  To report in them  So everyone  Loved the president  Everyone loved  Their priest  Everybody loved  Their  The head of the  Corporation 
[01:18:30]  Oh he's a good man  He's the head of the  Company and all that  But nowadays  You know everything  About everybody  Dirty little secrets  So therefore  No one looks  Everyone looks  As if they have  Clay feet  Which is the truth  We're all immortal  We're disappointed  That we realize  That they really are  Just as awful as we are  And it's kind of  It's a let down  We realize that  The individuals  That we kind of  Idolize  You were ahead of  Your time there  Jerry  You were ahead of  Your time  Well I certainly  Had that in mind  I wanted to show  What clay feet  Really were like  Follow me  What does that mean 
[01:19:00]  Clay feet  I've never heard that  That's just  You know  The whole  Cassius clan  Something  Statue  And then they  Just topple over  Because they're  They can't really  Move  They can't live up  To your  Standards  Jerry who's your  Guy  In this whole race  Well I like  Obama  For a second term  Oh yeah  Now he hasn't  Done everything  I've wanted  That's going to  Rip his hair out  No  He hasn't done  Everything I want  He's not liberal  Enough for me  And I realize  I'm not the  Mainstream  I'm far more  Liberal than most 
[01:19:30]  Americans  I get that  And but  So then when I  Get upset with him  It's because I  Wanted him to  Push harder  On a stimulus  There is no  Excuse why we  Don't have everyone  Working in America  I mean you know  You could put  Every construction  Person back to  Work tomorrow  If you just  Said let's fix  All the roads  All the school  Buildings  All the  Well he's been  He's been preaching  That for a while  But he doesn't  Have the votes  And so the  Question is  Should you know  In the end  He's you can't 
[01:20:00]  When you have  A congress  That is not  Of his party  And won't  And even some  Democrats don't  Go along with  Him  He can't  Get the votes  We don't  Have a dictator  Here  What happened  Before the election  He had votes  The votes  No  Before the  Well when he  First came in  The very first  Two years  I agree  The stimulus  Because he  Couldn't  The congress  Wouldn't  Including democrats  Many democrats  Would not go along  With a big enough  Stimulus bill  The stimulus  Was passed  But it was 
[01:20:30]  Too small  It didn't  Employ enough  People  It isn't only  That Jerry  What I've  Noticed  And it's a  Great idea  And it sounds  Very american  To put  Everybody to  Work  Fixing the  Infrastructure  Of this  Country  We did it  In the  Depression  Of course  Of course  But after  The depression  I don't think  There were  8,000 earmarks  And bullshit  Pork barrel  Crap  Connected to  These bills  Where you  Can't read it  And go  That's a  Wonderful idea  Let me turn  The page  There's an 
[01:21:00]  Awful idea  Connected to it  Why don't  They just  I hate the  Idea  That they  Can't just  Have  One  One subject  It's voted  On  It's passed  And do that  And now let's  Move on to  Something else  Instead of  Trying to  Shove in  Some of these  Which I don't  Like  Some of these  Social programs  Are atrocious  Just money  Pits  And yes  Rebuild the  Infrastructure  Of the U.S.  Put people  Back to work  Love that idea  Who wouldn't  Love that idea 
[01:21:30]  Well a lot of  Apparently a lot  Of people in  Government don't  Like the idea  But I don't  Think they  Like the idea  Because of  What was  Attached to it  You can't  Get up there  And tell the  American people  You're not  For putting  People to work  Fixing our  Infrastructure  Using the  Tax dollars  To improve  Your country  So your  Local  Congressperson  Says I  Won't vote  For this  Bill  Until  Unless part  Of the  Bill is  To fix  This road  In my  Neighborhood  Or to  Build this  Hospital in  My district  Whatever  So everyone  Says there's a 
[01:22:00]  Price  Each of these  Congresspeople  Say there's a  Price for my  Vote  And that's  Why the  Bills get  Bloated  But that's  That's in  The constitution  In terms  Of you  Elect a  Congressperson  The congressperson  Wants to get  Re-elected  Because he or  She runs  Every two  Years  And in  Order to  Get re-elected  You have  To show  That you  Did something  For your  District  Otherwise  Someone will  Challenge you  In the primary  And you'll  Get defeated  Because the  Other person  Running  Says  If you  Vote for  Me  I'll make  Sure  These  Potholes  Are fixed 
[01:22:30]  I'll make  Sure  This school  Gets the  Extra program  It needs  Or whatever  That's  That's the  Function  Of democratic  Politics  It's sloppy  It's fat  It's ugly  Etc  But we  Can't let  Those things  Get in the  Way with  The fact  That everyone  In america  Needs a job  If you  Want to have  A capitalist  System  Which we  All do  You only  Have three  Choices  There are  Only three  Ways that  People can  Make money  To support  Their families  They either  Have a job  They're either  On welfare  Or they  Steal  There's no 
[01:23:00]  Other way  To get  Money  You either  Get paid  For doing  Something  You're on  Of government  Welfare  Or you  Steal  We don't  Want people  To steal  Everyone  Complains  About welfare  Then you  Better make  Sure everyone  Has a job  And if  This idea  That the  Tax cuts  Are going  To make  More people  Get hired  Well wait  A second  We've had  These bush  Tax cuts  For the  Last eight  Years  So then  How come  Unemployment  Keeps going  Higher and  Higher and  Higher  You can't  Claim  It's on  Big taxes 
[01:23:30]  Because the  Taxes are  Lower  Imagine how  Horrid it  Would be  Without them  We'd have  More unemployment  That's what  I say  We'd hire  These people  I'm saying  Hire them  I am saying  Hire the  People to  Fix the  Roads  To build  The buildings  To do  The infrastructure  You've got  A million  Construction  Workers you  Could hire  Right away  To start  Fixing  Everything  Everything  We can  Play  So why  Don't  We do  It  Because  Right now  Everyone  Preys upon  The altar  Of  No new 
[01:24:00]  Taxes  Not for  Middle class  For people  Like me  How  You  Homosexuals  Why in  The world  Did you  Did you  Stop  We almost  Didn't  Raise the  Debt ceiling  In other  Words  We almost  Had America  Not be  Able to  Pay  Its  Obligations  Simply  Because  The  Republicans  Refused  To vote  For a  Tax  Increase  For  People  That  Are  In  The  Top  2% 
[01:24:30]  Because  They  Have  Told  Their  Constituency  They  Were  Not  Going  To  Vote  For  A  Tax  Increase  They  Didn't  So  Their  Crime  Is  Not  Lying  To  Their  Constituency  Wow  What a  Bunch  Of  Assholes  No  They  Should  Have  Told  The  Truth  That  This  Country  Can't  Make  It  Unless  Wealthier  People  Pay  A 
[01:25:00]  It  It  It  It  It  It  Is  Not  So  Here  What  Happens  You  Give  These  These  Major  Corporations  What  Is  General  Electric  Is  Sitting  On  Hundreds  Of  Millions  Of  Dollars  In  Cash  Every  Business  In  America  Does  Everything  It  Can  To  Hire  As  Few  People  As  Possible  As  Low  A  Wage  As  Possible  That  They  Will  Still  Take  The  Job  Every  Business  Has  To  Show  A  Profit  You  The  Way  You 
[01:25:30]  Get  The  Person  To  Agree  To  Work  For  Less  Wage  Or  To  Send  A  Job  To  Oversee  Where  You  Can  Hire  People  For  Less  The  Whole  Incentive  Of  Our  System  Is  To  Employ  As  Few  People  As  Possible  That  That's  That's  What  The  Discrepancy  In  What  We're  All  Talking  About  I  Don't  Think  The  Whole  Goal  Is  To  Employ  As  Few  People  As  You  Think  The  Who  You  Serious  You  Think  Serious  It  Is  Happening  Here  And  No  No  No  But  They're 
[01:26:00]  Not  Cutting  People  Here  The  Goal  Is  To  Make  Money  The  Goal  Is  To  Make  Money  But  That  Means  Employing  Less  People  And  So  Regular  People  Suffer  Until  It  Gets  To  The  Point  Where  You  Can  Make  More  Money  By  Hiring  More  People  And  Not  Have  Unions  Shaking  You  Taking  The  Profit  To  Hire  More  Thing  In  Stocks  Or  Whatever  That's  What  They  Want  To  Show  A  Bigger  Profit  I  Try  To  Tell  Him  That  He  Doesn't 
[01:26:30]  Believe  You  Jimmy  I'm  Gonna  Smack  You  Let's  Get  The  Head  Serious  On  The  Phone  Now  And  Saying  If  He's  Willing  To  Go  Or  She  Willing  To  Hire  More  People  He  Makes  A  Good  Point  By  Pushing  In  Our  Face  With  The  Sirius  XM  Thing  No  One  It  Looks  Like  There's  No  Real  Solution  To  This  Whole  Thing  Though  There  Is  What  Is  Your  Solution 
[01:27:00]  Sir  My  Solution  Is  First  Of  All  People  That  Are  Very  Well  That  The  People  In  The  Top  Or  To  Be  Willing  To  Pay  More  In  Taxes  We  Then  Use  Revenue  Bonds  To  Build  Things  In  America  That  Need  Building  So  You  Put  All  Those  People  Back  To  Work  Now  That  The  People  Are  Working  They  Pay  Taxes  So  The  Revenue  Bonds  Are  Paid  For  By  People  That  Are  Now  Working  And  Paying  Taxes  That  Is  How  We  Have  Done  It  Over  Time  So  Why  Don't  You  Agree  With  The  Entire  Country 
[01:27:30]  Paying  Taxes  A  Nice  Flat  Tax  Everyone  If  Someone  Makes  One  Freaking  Dollar  They  Got  To  Pay  17  Cents  On  It  The  Reason  Is  Because  The  First  Twenty  Thousand  Twenty  Etc  So  If  For  Example  If  You  Say  A  Flat  Tax  Let's  Say  Ten  Percent  Everyone  Pays  Ten  Percent  That  Sounds  Fair  It  Isn't  Fair  I'll  Tell 
[01:28:00]  You  Why  Because  Ten  Percent  Of  A  Person  That  Makes  Twenty  Thousand  Dollars  Is  Twenty  Five  Hundred  Dollars  That  Twenty  Hundred  Dollars  Is  Very  Important  Money  To  The  Person  That's  Only  Making  Twenty  Thousand  Dollars  Because  They  Need  That  In  Order  To  Be  Able  To  Eat  Then  You  Go  To  Make  To  Someone  Who  Makes  Twenty  Million  Dollars  Ten  Percent  Is  Two  Million  Sounds  Like  A  Lot  Of  Money  But  That  Person  Is  Left  With  Eight  Million  So  That  Person  Has  No  Sacrifice  At  All  Nothing  In  That  Person's  Life  Is  Changed  And  So 
[01:28:30]  That's  What's  Not  Fair  This  The  Burden  Has  To  Be  Equal  There's  Nothing  Fair  About  It  Says  The  Pursuit  Of  Happiness  There's  No  There's  No  Guarantee  In  This  Country  That  Says  That  You're  Absolutely  Going  To  Be  Taken  Care  Of  You're  Given  An  Opportunity  And  I  Think  People  Are  You  Think  We  Have  Equal  Opportunity  We  All  Have  Do  You  Think  That  Someone  Born  In  The  Inner  City  In  A  Single  Family  The  One  Parent  You  You  Like  Obama  That  Became  The  You 
[01:29:00]  Take  Obama  Versus  The  Millions  Of  People  That  Live  In  Poverty  You're  Saying  That  You  That  Take  Me  That  I  Started  Out  The  Same  Way  That  Person  Did  Maybe  Not  In  Your  Time  And  I'm  Not  Making  A  Joke  But  Things  Have  Changed  Drastically  Over  The  If  You  Think  Someone  Born  Into  A  Wealthy  Family  Is  Facing  Assuming  Their  Health  Is  The  Same  Is  Facing  This  Has  The  Same  Hurdles  That  Someone  That  Is  Born  In  Abject  Poverty  No  You  But  You're  Going  One 
[01:29:30]  Extreme  In  The  Other  But  There  Millions  Of  People  In  Poverty  Or  Millions  Of  People  That  Aren't  Born  Into  Wealthy  Families  That  Are  Struggling  That  Even  Get  A  College  Education  And  Can't  Find  A  Job  These  People  Have  It  Tough  In  A  Capitalistic  Society  There's  Always  Going  To  Be  The  Very  Poor  And  Very  Rich  But  The  Middle  Ground  Is  Where  The  Bulk  Of  Our  People  Are  And  That  Opportunity  To  Send  Their  Kids  To  College  Anymore  By  The  Way  I 
[01:30:00]  Baggage  It's  On  Every  Night  At  7  30  And  It's  A  Dating  Show  And  Let's  Say  A  Guy  Comes  On  And  There  Three  Beautiful  Women  And  He  Has  To  Choose  One  Of  Three  Women  That  He's  Going  To  Go  Out  With  And  They  All  Say  Well  Choose  Me  Choose  Me  I'm  Wonderful  Etc  But  During 
[01:30:30]  The  Course  Of  The  Show  They  Have  To  Reveal  Three  Items  Of  Baggage  Small  Medium  Woman  And  They  Are  Hugging  And  The  Audience  Is  Cheering  This  Is  Wonderful  But  Before  The  Show  Ends  Now  She  Gets  To  See  What's  In  His  Big  Bag  And  When  He  Opens  His  Bag  Sometimes  That's  Too  Much  Baggage  For  Her  So  She'll  Say  Thank you  Very  Much  For  Choosing  Me  But  I'm  Not  Going  Mommy  Issues  She  Dumps  But  Once  In  A  While  They

[01:31:30]  It's  Something  From  For  Example  I  Mean  It's  It's  Real  Life  Stuff  For  Example  It's  The  Baggage  Might  Be  I  Still  Have  Lunch  With  My  Ex  Every  Two  Weeks  Okay  So  If  You  Were  You  Were  Attracted  To  Let's  Say  You're  Single  You're  Attracted  To  A  Young  Woman  You  You  Want  To  Go  Out  With  There  And  You  Start  Dating  In  School  But  You  Notice  Once  Every  Two  Weeks  She's  Going  Out  With  The  Rex  With  That  Kind  Of  I  Don't  Want  To  Deal  With  That  Or  An  Extreme  One  Was  We  Had  A  Woman  Having  To  Choose  Among  Three  Guys  Good  Looking  Guys 
[01:32:00]  And  This  Woman  Was  Hot  So  She  Finally  Picks  The  One  Guy  He  Is  Just  Salivating  This  Is  Great  They're  Hugging  Now  He  Gets  To  See  What's  In  Her  Bag  She  Opens  Her  Bag  Well  Turns Out  She  Was  Born  A  Man  Wow  Can  You  Tell  Too  Many  Hormones  Not  Fully  Functional  You  Would  Think  On  My  Because  Of  My  Regular  Show  I'd  Be  That's  Why  I  Could  Not  Tell  The  Mistakes  Happen  Right  I  Mean  We  All  Make  The  Mistakes  What  Do  You  Mean  Jimmy  Would

[01:33:00]  A  Tiny  He  Has  A  Little  Baggage  For  You  I  Think  When  She  Was  Born  A  Man  Were  You  Able  To  Tell  At  That  Point  Then  You  Really  Start  Looking  That's  What I  Mean  Yeah  Well  If  You  Post  Close  Enough  Then  You  Start  Thinking  In  Your  Mind  Well  Yeah  I  Could  See  That  Could  Be  You  Know  Most  People  If  You  Change  You  Know  Forget  The  Obvious  But  If  They're  Dressed  And  You  Change  You  Could  Talk  Yourself  Into  Well  For  Example  A  Guy  Putting  On  A  Wig  Something  Well  Wouldn't  Be  Very  Good  Looking  Girl  But  I  Could 
[01:33:30]  See  You  Know  If  They  Have  No  Beard  You  You've  Got  25  Minutes  To  Get  Your  Hands  Off  You  Want  You  Me  On  Your  Other  Show  There  Jerry  Springer  Are  You  Still  Enjoying  The  Other  Show  Yes  Are  You  Really  Yeah  It's  21  21  Years  It's  Fun  To  Do  We  We  Shoot  Three  Shows  On  Monday  Two  On  Tuesday  And  You're  Still  Doing  The  Crazy  Schedule  You  Fly to  LA  For  Baggage  And  Come  Back  To  Stanford  Yeah  And 
[01:34:00]  You're  Doing  This  Weekly  Yeah  Well  I  Just  Finished  130  Shows  Of  Baggage  So  I  Have  A  30  130  A  Season  The  First  Season  Was  Short  One  Because  We  Were  Just  Trying  Out  The  Show  But  We've  Shot  300  Shows  And  It's  Doing  Well  Obviously  Yeah  Thank  God  I  Have  A  Question  For  Jerry  Which  Is  Off  The  Subject  It's  Political  But  I  Want  Your  Opinion  On  It  I  Enjoy  Listening  To  You  Talk  About  This  Why  Was  Jimmy  Carter  Presidency  Seen  As  A  Disaster  I  Know  It's  Totally  Off  The  Subject  He  Is  Democrat 
[01:34:30]  Democratic  Congress  Why  Was  His  Presidency  Seen  As  A  Disaster  Or  Do  You  Think  Because  That  Was  Really  The  Beginning  Of  Things  Seeming  Out  Of  Control  Because  You  Remember  During  His  Presidency  The  50  Hostages  Were  Taken  In  Iran  There  Was  Also  The  Oil  Embargo  Now  In  Fairness  Neither  Of  Those  The  Arab  Oil  Embargo  At  The  Time  Neither  Of  Those  World  Events  Had  Anything  To  Do  With  Who  The  President  Was  But  Somehow  We  Couldn't  Get  The  Hostages  Back 
[01:35:00]  Without  Having  Them  Killed  So  It's  Easy  To  Debate  It  But  When  You've  Got  50  People  There  And  They're  Americans  And  They're  Being  Held  And  You  Don't  Really  Want  To  You  Know  He  Tried  At  One  Point  Yeah  So  It  Seemed  Like  Everything  Was  Going  Bad  And  Then  Because  He  Wasn't  Liberal  Enough  To  Certain  Wing  Of  The  Party  Ted  Kennedy  Ran  Against  Him  In  The  Primaries  And  So  And  And  Did 
[01:35:30]  Even  Though  Carter  Beat  Him  He  Did  Reasonably  Well  And  Enough  That  Carter  Was  Damaged  Goods  He  Had  The  Hostages  Which  Remember  Didn't  Weren't  Released  Until  Inauguration  Day  As  Soon  As  Reagan  Was  Sworn  In  Within  Five  Minutes  They  Released  It  To  Make  The  Shaw  Wasn't  That  More  About  The  Shaw  Because  We  Gave  The  Shaw  A  Sanction  Here  That  Was  About  The  Shaw  But  I  Think  Coming  Over  Here  To  Have  The  Cancer  Treatment  I'm  Not  Sure  If  That  Came  Afterwards  But 
[01:36:00]  Anyway  Yes  It  Clearly  Was  That  We  Backed  The  Shaw  There  Was  A  Revolution  Ayatollah  Khamenei  Hated  America  And  So  That's  When  All  Of  That  Really  Became  A  Major  Issue  So  Carter  Was  But  He  Didn't  He  Was  Damaged  Goods  Within  The  Party  Itself  And  Then  Remember  He  Barely  Lost  To  Ford  So  It  Wasn't  Like  You  Know  It  Was  A  Landslide  You  Know  And  The  Next  Election  Reagan  Won  In  A  Landslide  Against  Mondale  So 
[01:36:30]  Do you  Think  Reagan  Was  A  Good  President  He  Was  Too  Conservative  For  Me  But  I  Think  He  Was  A  Good  President  Yeah  Did  He  Not  A  Great  One  But  A  Good  One  My  Friend  And  I  A  Guy  Who  Was  Coming  In  After  You  Leave  A  Comedian  We  Had  A  Big  Screaming  Match  Because  He  Was  Saying  Reagan  Didn't  Care  About  Poor  People  At  All  The  AIDS  Argument  I  Didn't  Get  Ready  Ant  Well  That  Gets  Too  Personal  In  Otherwise  I  Don't  Think  These  People  Go  Home  And  Say  I  Don't  Care  About  If  Poor  People  Die  Or 
[01:37:00]  A  Political  Point  Of  View  You  Know  There's  A  Reason  Why  Most  Wealthy  People  Are  Republican  There's  A  Reason  And  It's  Not  Because  They're  Bad  People  But  Because  Wealthy  People  Can  Mostly  Afford  Things  At  Least  In  Their  Own  Mind  By  Themselves  They  Don't  Need  The  Public  School  They  Can  Afford  A  Private  School  They  Don't  Need  The  Public  Health  Clinic  Because  They  Can  Afford  Their  Doctors  They  Don't 
[01:37:30]  Need  The  Public  Schools  Because  They  Can  Afford  Their  Own  Homes  Their  Own  Transportation  Their  Own  Recreation  So  Therefore  Since  They  Don't  See  Themselves  As  Getting  A  Lot  Out  Of  From  The  Government  They  Then  Start  Having  Lack  Of  Sensitivity  Why  Should  I  Pay  Taxes  I  Don't  Use  Any  Of  Those  Services  Without  Looking  At  The  Bigger  Picture  That  The  Reason  We  Have  A  Wonderful  Country  Is  You  Do 
[01:38:00]  You  Realize  Though  There's  A  Lot  Of  People  That  Have  Money  I'll  Include  Myself  In  This  That  Pay  A  Lot  Of  Taxes  And  Don't  Want  To  Pay  More  Taxes  I  Feel  I'm  Doing  My  Part  And  Then  To  Be  Told  That  I'm  Not  Patriotic  I'm  Not  Doing  Enough  When  Every  Quarter  I'm  Writing  Unbelievable  Checks  I  Pay  For  A  School  System  Which  I  Understand  I  Want  To  Live  In  Nice  Neighborhood  It's  Going to 
[01:38:30]  Cost  To  Be  Told  That  I'm  Not  Doing  Enough  Really  Is  Kind  Of  A  Slap  In  The  Face  And  I  Haven't  Always  Had  Money  Jerry  Believe  It  Or  To  Look  At  Me  You'd  Think  I've  Been  Rich  My  Whole  Life  So  To  Achieve  Something  In  Life  In  This  Country  And  To  Be  Told  You're  Not  Doing  Enough  Makes  People  Very  Resentful  I'm  Not  Talking  About  The  Faceless  Corporation  That  Is  Not  Paying  Any  Taxes 
[01:39:00]  Getting  Refunds  After  Billions  Of  Dollars  Of  Revenue  I'm  Just  Saying  The  Guy  That  Is  Making  250  Thousand  Dollars  Even  More  Than  That  That  Would  Fall  Into  That  Category  Gets  Very  Resentful  Being  Told  He's  Not  Doing  Enough  When  Every  Day  You're  Being  Told  To  Do  More  And  Do  More  That's  That's  Where I  Get  And  My  And  My  Answer  Is  First  First  Of  I  Don't  Know  That  Every  Day  They're  Being  Told  Do  More  Do  More  Do  More  It's  Interesting  This

[01:40:00]  Yet  Here's  The  Reality  Let's  Say  One  Hundredth  Of  One  Percent  Not  One  Hundredth  One  Millionth  Of  One  Percent  Of  All  Americans  Will  Ultimately  Meet  Their  End  By  Happening  To  Be  In  A  Building  That  Gets  Hit  By  A  Plane  One  Millionth  Of  One  Percent  Of  Us  That  Horrible  Event  99.9%  Of  Us  Will  Leave  This  Planet  Because  Of  A  Disease  Or  An 
[01:40:30]  Accident  So  We  Know  In  The  End  That  Disease  Or  Accident  Is  What  Is  Going  To  Kill  Kill  Kill  Us  And  Our  Loved  Ones  We  Know  That's  The  Enemy  And  Yet  We  Get  So  Resentful  If  We  Are  Going  To  Spend  Money  To  Make  Sure  That  All  Americans  Are  In  A  Position  To  At  Fight  Off  Disease  If  You  Love  America  You  Wouldn't  Worry  If  Someone  That  You  Don't  Even  Know  Gets  Killed  In  A  Building  That  Gets  Hit  By  A  Plane 
[01:41:00]  You  Are  Fine  To  Spend  That  Money  Thank  You  For  Being  A  Good  Humanitarian  And  Doing  That  I  Think  We  Should  But  I  Want  That  Same  Feeling  When  Someone's  Dying  Of  Cancer  When  Someone's  Dying  Of  Diabetes  Why  Why  Are  We  All  Of  A  Sudden  Said  Obamacare  Like  A  Snooty  Kind  Of  Thing  You  Know  What  If  I  Am  So  Privileged  To  Live  In  America  And  To  Make  A  Lot  Of  Money  Here  In  America  If  I  Got  To  Pay  A  Little  Bit  More  You  Know  What  I  Don't  Want  To 
[01:41:30]  Live  Anyplace  Else  This  Is  The  Best  Country  In  The  World  And  If  My  Do's  Get  To  Be  A  Little  Bit  Higher  Am  I  Going  To  Now  Starve  Do  I  Have  To  Sell  My  House  Do  I  Do  I  Have  To  Get  Rid  Of  My  Child  I  Mean  This  Business  Whining  I  Am  Not  Saying  That  People  That  Are  Making  $30,000  A  Year  50,000  100  150,000  Need  To  Spend  More  But  When  People  Are  Making  Millions  Of  Dollars  A  Year  Do  You  Know  I  Don't  Pay  Any  More  In 
[01:42:00]  The  Payroll  Tax  Than  A  Person  Who  Makes  $100,000  A  Year  I  Make  Let's  Say  Several  Millions  Okay  So  I  Make  Millions  And  I  Don't  Pay  One  Penny  More  In  The  Payroll  Tax  Than  Someone  Who  Earns  $100,000  A  Year  You  Think  That's  Fair  There's  Nothing  Fair  About  That  There's  Also  Nothing  Fair  About  The  Other  Side  Too  There  Are  There's  Certain  Things  In  Our  Tax  Laws  That  Are  Not  Fair  I  Think  Both  Ways  And 
[01:42:30]  Again  I  Just  Don't  Like  The  Fact  That  50%  Of  The  Country  Isn't  Paying  Taxes  I  Don't  Like  The  Fact  That  The  Top  10%  Paying  90%  Of  99%  Of  Tax  It's  But  I  Do  Like  Your  Point  You  Can  Allow him  To  Just  Have  That  No  No  He  Made  That  That  Was  An  Amazing  Moment  He  Made  A  Great  Point  That  Was  Liberal  Shit  Does  Jerry  Have  To  Leave  All I  Was  Patriotic  Music  As  Jerry  Jerry

Hey, did you go really classy lately?  Did you go really classy lately?  I heard that they put laser printing of your family's photos on your nails.  Did you get that classy?  Oh, he didn't go there.

Steve, I want to let you know, Miller Place, Mastic, all those areas out there where, you  know, the expressway pretty much turns into a two-lane fucking road, and you either have  a choice.  You either have ghetto-ass thugs, or you have inbred fucking toothless white trash.  It's pretty much like this.  I don't live in Mastic.  You live out east.  Guys, I feel like I'm about to jump the shark, so I'm going to fucking take it. 
[03:08:30]  Nice.  Great job, Chris.  Fucking bravo.  Enjoyable.  Bravo.  That guy could probably win a Long Island fucking trivia contest.  Oh, yeah.  He knows it all.  I have no idea what that guy was saying.  Yes, you do.  Because you're intoxicated.  Yes, you could.  He was speaking your language.  Yes, he was.  He gave you a very accurate description and a good beating.  Nice.  Good beating.  Take it.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike in New York.  Mikey.  I so want her to go out with Bobo.  Yeah, we found Bobo's date, by the way.  Yeah.  Uh, Mikey.  I just want the $1,000.  I don't want to go out with Bobo. 
[03:09:00]  Shut up.  Yeah, Jackie, I want to ask you something.  Were you ever married?  Yes.  Yes, I am married.  You are married.  All right.  Was the relationship good with your marriage?  Uh, no, because I'm getting divorced.  Oh, okay.  Well, I think I know what your problem is.  I really do, if you let me finish, okay?  You had a...  Oh, are you going to start screaming at me like that other guy?  Because I had no idea what I was saying?  Oh.  No, no, I'm not going to scream at you.  That's for good.  If you just shut up and listen to me for a minute. 
[03:09:30]  Excuse me.  Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.  Here comes the end word.  Here comes the end word.  Yeah, yeah.  I know what your problem is with black men or black people, specifically black men.  You had sex with probably a really good black man, and he destroyed your fucking sex life with your white...  Oh, my God.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Oh.  I've never fucking...  You've out-protested too much.  I think someone's on to something.  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like. 
[03:10:00]  I'm not kidding you at all.  That's why you're such a...  A...  A...  I hate niggas.  I don't...  I don't hate them because they're black.  I hate them because they're niggas.  Jackie, it's okay if you slept with a black guy.  So well.  No one cares.  Come on.  Jackie is good.  It's no problem.  It's, you know, it's 2000.  Don't be embarrassed about it.  Yeah.  Jackie.  So fucking miserable after getting fucked.  So good for a black man, it ruined all your sex life with a white guy.  And you know what?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's all right, Jackie.  So what?  So what?  No one cares.  You can talk about it here.  It's fine. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Let it out.  Yeah.  We're amongst friends, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't fucking...  You know, a nigger?  Never.  I don't believe you.  I think you're lying, and that guy hit the nail on the head.  No.  Yep.  So do I.  That's fucking rude.  No, I'm not.  They are.  I'm not lying.  Yes, you are.  I saw your photo.  You look like the type of girl that probably had sex with a black guy.  Yes, you do.  You're kind of trashy, and you probably got bored.  Fuck you.  No, no, no.  I have never fucked a nigger.  Don't be upset about that.  You did so much.  You should play the beep game with her and make it sound like she's saying something else.  Right. 
[03:11:00]  Something nice.  Something nice, yeah.  Jackie, don't be so defensive.  No one thinks less of you.  Jackie, you won't be able to get a job saying a nigger so much.  Yeah.  Oh, a job.  What?  Are you right there?  Yeah.  I could be the fucking doorman.  I think he fucked you cross-eyed, by the way.  I got to tell you something.  Oh, my God.  Black guy fucked you cross-eyed, dude.  Wow.  Wow.  We got a picture of Jackie.  That's great.  You look Asian.  Maybe it's because she looks like that woman that the chimp ripped her face off and had 
[03:11:30]  a face replacement surgery.  Oh, my God.  You have no fucking, like...  What did they do?  You had work done.  Did you have work done?  Yes.  I'm a disaster, but I got money, so I fucked cute girls.  Did you have work done, Jackie?  It's okay if you did.  Like, when Mr. Ed died, did they put his teeth in you?  Did Brutus the Barber Beefcake give you that dew?  With his shears?  Yeah.  You have hair like Leif Garrett in 1978. 
[03:12:00]  Thank God you got bangs, though.  Wait a minute.  Is that the gold chain?  Is it the gold chain?  We see the gold chain.  It's the gold chain.  You lying crock of shit.  You got bangs that are covering a forehead that looks like those hiney-headed aliens from  Star Trek.  You got a big-ass forehead, man.  You're like a beluga whale.  Oh, Christ.  Wow, you are... 
[03:12:30]  Thank you, sir.  You're a charmer, Jackie.  A charmer.  Are you a member of the Wayouts?  But, Jackie, that guy was right, and it's fine.  You get way too defensive about the fact that you slept with black.  It's not a big deal.  If you got your feelings hurt or you got hurt in a relationship, just admit it.  It's not...  Don't be ashamed of.  It has to be something, and that sounds like it.  I slept with Holly Berry, and it ruined it for me and my wife.  Okay, sir.  Thank you.  Yeah, okay.  We got it.  Thank you.  Bye.  Uh, Jannera wants in. 
[03:13:00]  Uh, this might be it for you.  Jackie's gone?  Jackie?  Jackie?  Jackie?  Fuck.  Oh.  I'm lost her.  Your phone card ran out.  You know what that is really hysterical about her?  She doesn't realize?  She's every single thing that she hates about black people, she does.  She's not working.  Like, all the stereotypes that make her hate black people is exactly what she is.  It's hilarious.  Some people are so racist, they forget who they are. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, she is.  They forget that she's poor.  She's the piece of shit that she pictures every black person being.  That piece of shit is her.  She would say, they just sit at home and drink all day.  Yeah.  What I do?  She's drunk at fucking nine in the morning.  She fucking doesn't work.  She's on the till from someone else's fucking money.  How come you don't like blacks?  Because they got mullets and big teeth and thin gold chains and Kirk Douglas chins.  Crossed eyes? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, man.  You got mullet turtle decks, too.  Sandy Duncan's laughing at her fucking eyes.  Well, she's back, ladies and gentlemen.  Jackie, you're back?  What happened?  Did you get mugged?  No, I...  Okay, my track phone didn't run out.  Oh, okay.  We get it.  Yeah, let me say hi to Gennaro from Middle Island.  You're on with Jackie.  Middle Island.  You want to know something really sad?  No.  I was going to make a joke saying that, you know, she had to recharge her phone card, 
[03:14:30]  but she actually went ahead and spoke about her stupid fucking track phone.  I bet you live in the side of someone's fucking house in a rented apartment, you trashy cunt.  No, you asshole.  I own my own house, you douchebag.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Jackie, did you ever work?  You ever work?  Did you have a career?  Waitress.  Guaranteed.  What did you do for a living?  I would...  I'd rather not say...  Come on!  What did you do?  What profession, at least?  I was in nursing. 
[03:15:00]  Nursing?  Oh, boy.  I worked at a fucking Rite Aid.  That's a Rite Aid outfit.  It is.  It's got the fucking Rite Aid.  It has a blue vest and a fucking light blue...  Where did you get the picture of this?  Where did you get the picture of this?  She's nursing a beer.  Somebody fucking...  Someone knows her.  Someone knows her.  Sent a picture.  Whatever.  We've seen it, though.  I don't know what picture you guys are looking at.  I didn't see it. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  Well...  All right.  We got Sean in Albany.  Sean, go ahead.  I'm trying to figure something out here.  You're making fun of my fucking ass.  And my fucking...  Fodhead.  It's like...  We're making fun of every...  Where have you been?  Yeah.  You got a weird hairdo.  Yeah, your hair is fucking like...  You really look like one of the way outs.  You really do.  Yeah.  It's like...  We're gonna go way out, way out.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  Wow.  We got Sean in Albany.  Go ahead.  Hey, I just wanted to ask this woman. 
[03:16:00]  I'm trying to get something straight.  She's a fat lady, doesn't have a job, lives off someone else's chest, is very obnoxious.  You are kind of fat.  Yeah.  95 pounds is a little fat.  She didn't have a problem with any of the other shit this guy said.  She's like, hey, wait.  I'm fat?  Don't call me fat.  Yeah, I'm lazy.  I'm on the till.  I'm fucking trash.  I'm drunk.  I'm mullet.  Don't call me fat, you motherfucker.  She's drinking by now.  I just want to know exactly what it is about black people she hates. 
[03:16:30]  Everything.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  I gotta be honest.  I just checked Twitter.  I don't know what a track phone is either.  What is a track phone?  I don't know.  It's a throwaway phone.  She goes, I don't know.  It's something.  Oh, she just had to fucking bring it.  You don't want to know, Keith.  No, she goes, I don't know.  Earmuffs.  It's something that niggas have.  Earmuffs. 
[03:17:00]  Earmuffs, Keith.  I don't want to hear this.  Listen to this racism.  It's hurting my feelings.  Wow, the South is calling us out.  Yeah, the South is calling us out.  You know, I really don't like the way this woman's talking.  Here's Scott.  Scott, go ahead.  What the fuck, boys?  Y'all got more fucking racists up there than we do down here.  God damn.  He's actually, the South is pissed that the North is more racist now.  Oh, shit.  Actually, I'm moving down South next year. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, are you?  Where?  We don't want you.  Wow, that's not good.  The South don't want you.  The South doesn't want you racist ass.  That's bad.  I'm going to tell you something.  Y'all are missing a point.  What happened is she's getting a divorce.  Oh, her husband probably caught the husband with a black chick.  Or the husband caught her with a black guy and left her. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that what happened to you?  Oh, yeah.  A black guy left me.  No, no.  Your husband caught you with a black guy and he left you.  And he left you.  No, absolutely not.  That's all right.  Have we asked her what her race is?  What's your race, Jackie?  Irish, Scottish, and English.  Oh, yeah.  Anglo.  Do you ever hear of conditioner?  Yeah.  You got Michelle Bachman eyes.  They're all over the place.  All right, man. 
[03:18:30]  All right there, Scott.  I don't understand what that guy's saying.  You don't understand anything because you're drunk at fucking...  No, I'm not drunk yet.  Oh, this is a good question coming in from Pat on Long Island.  Pat, go ahead.  Pat.  Hey, I was wanting to know what your Craigslist hair looks like.  Is it like $20, $20 roses for a fucking blumpkin or something?  $20 roses for a fucking blumpkin.  I love that.  $20 roses.  How about you let us laugh, Jackie?  I know.  Is that okay? 
[03:19:00]  Let me go to Shane in Texas.  Shane.  Yeah, I hope...  She said she was in nursing.  I'm guessing that she probably stole all the old people's medication and stuff.  And she strung out on pills.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  And I bet you were on cops in the 80s, weren't you, on a domestic dispute?  You know, I don't think so.  What happened to your nursing career?  Oh, fuck you.  Take that fucking gun that you could carry around on your fucking waistband, unconcealed,  and shoot yourself in the fucking temple. 
[03:19:30]  What happened to your nursing career?  Wow, why, that hit too close to home?  Why so angry?  Yeah, why are you a failed nurse?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened in the nursing thing?  Fuck you, I didn't like it.  I can't get along with women.  You can't get along with women?  You can't get along with anyone, it sounds like.  Yeah.  Who do you get along with?  You're getting a divorce, you can't get along with women, you're a racist.  So, like, who do you get along with?  Budweiser.  I get along with my dogs.  With your dogs?  Oh.  Do they lick you?  Bottle of a jar of Jiffy?  Yeah.  Jiff peanut butter? 
[03:20:00]  No, they don't.  They don't.  They are allergic to peanut butter.  Oh, you tried.  Oh, you tried.  I had to find that out.  You tried.  I said it was in my cunt.  What the fuck do you think, you idiot?  So, how come no Jackie?  Are their tongues swollen from there?  How did you fail as a nurse?  You wanted to be a nurse.  How did you fail at that?  I didn't want to be a nurse.  I was doing it to make money, to pay my rent.  Okay, so you kind of had to horror yourself and be a nurse.  What happened?  Why did you fail?  I didn't fail.  I just left.  I didn't want to do it. 
[03:20:30]  So, you just had no other job, so you quit?  Yep.  Hey, what's your favorite wine cooler?  Wine cooler?  Oh, let's see.  Do they still make Bartlett and James?  Yeah.  Those two black guys.  Bartlett and James.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like Jankum and Grape Drink and fucking 40 ounces.  Yeah, we get it. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  And just FYI, we have to conceal our handguns in Texas.  We can't legally carry them out.  I don't know.  Next week, boys, when you have to apologize, is this going to be a real apology or a fake?  How much education do you have?  James in Georgia wants to know.  Oh.  What's your schooling?  Did you graduate high school?  Everything people hate about black people.  Yeah, everything.  Of course. 
[03:21:30]  All the stereotypes that go into your racism.  Instead of looking at your own awfulness, you are it.  No job drinking in the morning.  No education.  What position are you in to dislike anybody?  Right.  You're garbage personified.  Excuse me.  Go fuck yourself.  No, no, no.  I love the excuse.  Well, in all fairness, you knew that was coming, Jimmy.  Allow me to be taught.  Go fuck yourself.  You had to know that was coming.  Holy a drunk bitch. 
[03:22:00]  God forbid you ask a real question.  Yeah, no, go ahead.  Go ahead, garbage.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I'm not even mad at you, but you really are.  Is that her, too?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What is she doing with Janine?  Janine.  That's interesting.  Is that at FH Riley's?  Wait a minute.  Please, no.  It is at FH.  That's that chain again.  That's shitty gold chain.  That's thin.  Are you sure someone stole it?  That's a shitty gold chain.  That's a piece of shit.  Are you sure somebody stole it and didn't just evaporate when the fucking water hit it? 
[03:22:30]  It's not cute.  That piece of shit.  Who gave you that piece of shit gift?  There was a light summer breeze and the thing snapped.  It flew away.  I think a bed bug took off with it.  Why are you obsessed with gold chains, Jackie?  You guys are such dicks.  Why are you obsessed with gold chains?  Who gave you that gold chain?  I bought that for myself.  That piece of shit, thin, fucking off of-  It's not an extreme.  It wasn't fucking cheap.  It's ugly.  It is cheap.  That thing is worth less than $100. 
[03:23:00]  $62.  That's not cheap for her.  I paid weight more than that.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  You're lying.  Yeah, I did.  You're lying.  I was the one who fucking slid the fucking-  No, you didn't.  It was me for it.  I know how much it cost.  You didn't.  And I'm not just saying that because your head is kind of rectangle-shaped.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  What do you look like?  I'm very average looking.  Your bangs make your head very rectangular.  You have a head like Frankenberry. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, you really do.  Those bangs are trying to cover a world of hurt.  Wait.  Star Trek, dude.  That fucking thing with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Is that what you're going to fucking call me next?  No, I'm not going to call you a Klingon.  I'm just saying.  You already said that.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  People want to know if you're an animal hoarder.  Do you hoard shit?  No, I only have two dogs.  Okay.  Now, that other one's a mirror.  Oh, my God.  Get it?  Brad in Maryland's got to go. 
[03:24:00]  Brad, go ahead.  You're on with Jackie.  Yes.  Is this Pete Rose-headed lady moving south to-  She said she's moving down south, right?  Does that mean I slipped?  Long Island jokes.  Long Island humor.  I'm heading way down south.  Yeah.  Fucking Long Beach.  Or South Long Island or something.  Exactly, Chip.  We got a guy from Alabama, man.  Steve.  Oh, God, no.  Not Alabama.  Steve.  Hey, Jackie.  Yes?  Keep your googly-eyed, mad dog 2020 ass in New York. 
[03:24:30]  We don't want your ass down here.  Excuse me.  I wouldn't move to Alabama anyway, because you people all fucking suck fucking dick.  We suck, right?  She showed you.  Wow, man.  She showed you.  Hey, Jackie.  Can you play the guitar?  And would you stand in Times Square?  Ew.  Ew.  Exactly.  No, but the naked cowboy is supposed to, like, be out here next week somewhere. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, Jackie, do you sit on your porch every month and wait for your damn check to come  in the mail?  Oh, my God.  No.  I get it directly positive.  Oh, my God.  Ew.  You fucking idiot.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing a Jim Norton shirt.  Oh, my God.  I love this chick.  That's one of my...  You stink and I don't like you.  Yes.  You're wearing one of my shirts in the photo we're looking at.  At my book signing?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Jackie, do you ever change your hairdo?  Yeah, sometimes I fucking wash it. 
[03:25:30]  That's funny.  She has teeth like Austin Powers.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is something, man.  Oh, all right.  We got Marianne.  Hold on.  Marianne wants to call you out on something.  Marianne, go ahead.  Marianne.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Hi.  Jackie, you said you were a nurse.  Nurse Jackie.  Yes, I was.  Why?  You said you have no education.  Yeah, I have education.  I didn't say that.  You did say that.  You did say that.  Yeah, yeah.  You said none. 
[03:26:00]  You're lying again.  What community college?  Did you think...  Oh, she's calling you.  You were an ass wiper.  You really weren't a nurse.  You went in and just wiped asses.  No, I wasn't an ass wiper.  What did you do as a nurse?  Excuse me?  What did you do as a nurse?  Let's see.  I inserted catheters.  I took care of old people.  Ass wiper.  Yeah, an ass wiper.  You are. 
[03:26:30]  So you're like a nurse's assistant, I would assume?  Yep.  Were you sad when the blind girl touched your face and was shocked at how big your face is?  Jackie, I'm looking at your photo.  Were you sad when you were going to take those pins out of that map?  What a fucking...  Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  Jimmy's funny.  Jimmy's a funny gang.  10-0-2.  All right, yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Let's get the...  Wow.  Marion, thank you.  Are we done yet?  Yes.  Yeah, get out of here.  That, um...  Keith, thank you.  Yeah, that was something.  Oh, man.  Sorry you had to hear that, Keith.  You know, I kind of...  It was good.  You're not surprised, though, right?  No.  Not at all.  I'll be in Utah this Friday, Saturday at Wise Guys Comedy Club.  That's my whole plug.  That's it?  That's it?  That's your whole plug?  That's it.  Wow, we stopped short here.  That was...  Wow.  I think we're all exhausted after that. 
[03:27:30]  Janine, apparently pals with this woman.  Horrible racist.  Halsey, walsy.  I can't beat you.  She wanted to see the help.  I don't think Janine's going to be welcome at my house anymore.  Nope.  We all have to say goodbye to Janine at this point.  I'm looking at her right now.  Janine looks drunk.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  She's not even listening.  Whatever.  Keith, no promotions?  Well, I mean, let's go with it.  You want to promote your AOL?  I'm on AOL from noon to... 
[03:28:00]  Can they call you track phone?  I call my track phone.  Hope you enjoyed your time here on the show.  I really enjoyed it, man.  I'm going to go...  I'm sure you'll be back soon.  I'm going to go commit a hate crime right now.  I'm just going off to fucking Long Island.  That's what Jackie did.  Now Keith's got to take it out of some poor white bitch.  After I seen the help, I thought I had to do it.  But now I'm really going to do it.  Yeah, you really...  You know something?  I'm backing your hate crime today.  See, there's a ripple effect.  This is what happens.  Now Keith actually has to mug an old bitch.  I got to snatch a gold chain if I can find one. 
[03:28:30]  That horrible gold chain.  Why is she wearing a gold chain like that?  You doing any gigs?  Yeah, well, I'm at the cellar.  Then I'm on tour.  And then I'm in Little Kev's little stupid movie.  Feel My Pain.  Oh, it's September.  Starting September.  A little stupid movie.  Yeah, it's a dumb movie.  God damn, that's cool.  Feel My Pain and all that.  Nothing wrong with that, man.  Well, yeah, thanks for coming here.  No, thank you guys, man.  Are you going to come back soon?  This was good, man. 
[03:29:00]  This was good.  You only show up every two years or something like that.  I get through that traffic, God damn it.  That's the problem, right?  It doesn't blow.  Yeah, that traffic is...  It'll come in earlier.  It'll make you cry.  And now with the toll hike, it's really going on.  I don't know if I can make it too much money.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  They just assume people will pay it, I guess.  Yeah, they just...  I would imagine more people would say,  well, fuck that.  I'll have to figure out something else.  No, you got to pay it.  So people just know.  I want my easy pass.  It's going to even, you know.  Yeah.  Four dollars.  Are they just shooting up?  They just don't go up that high.  They want a two dollar hike. 
[03:29:30]  They're just going for four.  And they'll say, all right, we'll do two.  And then when you see two, you're like, okay.  It's a car salesman.  Not as bad as four.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what we all accept, though.  We're fucking lemmonds.  What will it take for me to get you in that tunnel today?  Two bucks?  We're pathetic.  The people are pathetic.  What do I have to do?  I don't know what we're supposed to do.  We'll shoot you across that bridge.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, that drunk.  Jesus Christ.  She was funny. 
[03:30:00]  That's great.  I have a guy who ripped her so hard.  Yeah, he gave her a nice beating.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, by the way, let me just say that.  Jackie, if you are listening, leave the door unlocked.  I'll be home soon.  Thanks for having me.  The virus.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir. 
[03:30:30]  After ONA Live here on Wednesday, some of our audience is really racist.  Roland, as a Mexican, were you offended by, what was her name?  Jackie, the racist we just heard from?  No.  Not at all.  But then again, you disown your Mexican heritage as well.  Uh, no.  Was that no in Spanish?  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  You got to pick a different word if you're going to take on the Spanish.  Uh-huh.  Were you, uh, you were...  No, seÃ±or.  You were upset today.  Nah.  Oh.  About the thing before.  What thing before?  In the beginning of the show, when they talked about...  Because yesterday, we ended the show with Joel McHale.  Uh-huh.  He stayed later.  That's why there wasn't an after show.  And there were accusations of you being a liar.  And then today, it was like a whole bit where Roland is a liar.  That's like your thing.  You were upset by that.  Joel...  You don't like that.  Joel busts balls. 
[03:31:30]  Right.  Everybody busts balls.  Right.  So I took it.  Right.  But you, you, you, you don't acknowledge that you're a liar.  Well, you don't, you're not going to admit you're a liar.  Then, like, you don't lie.  We all fabricate sometimes because it's the business.  Right.  You have to fabricate just a little bit to understand things.  And to get things across and to make everybody happy.  Yeah, to make things like this.  But you're not like a person who just randomly goes out and will just lie for no reason.  No.  Because that's how they were portraying you. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't lie for no reason.  Mars, what do you think?  It's not like when Mars, like, talked trash about Rob Cross before he went on the air.  Like, I would never say that on the air.  Did you talk about Rob?  No.  See, that was a lie.  Oh, you lied about that.  See, that was an example.  See, talk about lying.  I don't know if we're moving too quickly, but I do have an issue with lying.  Okay, I'll get to your issue in a second.  Because I just wanted to get, do you think Roland, when you interact with him, why do you think he's perceived to be a liar?  Or do you think that's just an on-air thing?  Well, he has to justify certain things sometimes. 
[03:32:30]  You know, maybe rationalize why you can't get, you know, certain DVDs or...  So you think your position, Roland, requires you to lie sometimes?  No, not a lie, just to tweak the truth until you get the answer.  Okay.  That's the whole job in the industry, between the talent department, between the publicists, between everything.  Everybody has to tweak.  Do you ever get, like, stressed out that tweaking the truth and tweaking the truth will end up, like, just in a pile of lies that could explode in your face at one point? 
[03:33:00]  If you work in this environment, you know there's going to be a dick in the ass.  It could be today, tomorrow, now.  You never know.  You need a dick in the ass t-shirt.  It's, I mean, like, you could have the best week possible, bringing Brad Pitt, and you could have the great week.  Then one Thursday, you say, oh, yeah, yeah, I'll get that for you.  And you forget?  The whole week's erased.  They forget everything.  They're just dicks coming right at you. 
[03:33:30]  Is it possible to do your job and be 100% honest?  Yeah, it's called unemployed.  Right.  So you will not, you will not be working.  I mean, you're obviously successful at your job.  I'll be every day, you'll go, who do you have?  No one, guys.  No one, because you tell the truth.  I tell the truth.  Like when Opie says, at the last minute, no, we don't want to talk to him, cancel him.  That's not a position where you could tell the truth.  Yeah, or why is this person or that person or this or that? 
[03:34:00]  But you did seem a little angry.  I don't know if you, I don't think you were on the air, but off the air, you seem a little  perturbed when you poked your head in the studio when they went to break that they were calling  you a liar.  You're a little perturbed.  I hit my shit on me and I just scream out and then I move on.  Right.  Because you get, you got a lot of stress to deal with.  Yeah.  Then they're calling you a liar on the air and then you just had to hit him.  Yeah, I'm not mad at them at all.  But in that moment.  Yeah.  I mean, hey, we all have, we're Ladins.  We're Mexicans.  We always get angry. 
[03:34:30]  Ladins.  Ladins.  Mexicans.  Eric, do you see, what do you think of, because you hang out with Roland all the time.  We talked about this.  You guys share an office.  You're like brothers.  You think Roland's a liar?  Do you think that you could call him?  I don't know.  Well, ever since there's a French fry incident, he may say yes.  Right.  There was the incident where Roland, for no reason, smeared French fries all over Eric's possession.  No, French fry grease.  No, French fries.  Well, you took French fries and you smeared the grease and then you actually smeared the fry in his keyboard. 
[03:35:00]  I had too much sugar that day.  You were excited.  He did lie about that.  Do you think Roland is a liar or do you think he lies like people do?  No, for what his position requires, I know he's good at what he does, so he does have to alter the truth a bit in order to protect us, to protect the show.  So you're saying, look.  But there's other times where, like if I can, I usually sometimes can tell, so I'll call him out on it and he'll just laugh and say, yes, I'm lying. 
[03:35:30]  But there's other times, like the Joel McHale thing, he totally had me snowed that this was, that Joel was helping him write everything.  Everything just had one thing he helped.  He didn't write it all.  When you catch Roland in a lie.  Yeah.  And he admits that he was lying.  Usually right away he admits that he's lying.  But then when he explains what the truth is, don't you think he might still be lying again, just a second lie?  Yeah, sometimes I think you just peeled the layer off and then there's a second tier lie right under it. 
[03:36:00]  But usually the second tier lie is pretty damn believable for what he throws, like why he didn't go with that first.  But maybe that's his game plan, that he throws this out there expecting somebody to call him on and then he'll throw this out there and everyone's like, oh, that's believable.  Well, that's the truth.  I wish I could be that good of an evil genius.  What happens when you get called out on a lie?  What are you going to do?  You just say, all right, I was lying.  But then you really quickly try to make up another lie? 
[03:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look, look at our presidents.  They tell the truth?  No.  No, they don't.  That's their jobs.  I mean, who are you looking up to, right?  Who are your role models?  Obama and Bill Clinton.  That's my role models.  And guess what?  They lie from time to time.  And the guy from the Real Housewives, but since he's died, he's not my role.  Now he's off the list before he was there.  He's on my top three.  Now he's off.  Do you feel, do you get worried that when they bring it up on the air like this, it ruins  your reputation?  Is that why it kind of bugs you?  Because people...  I've got a finger in my ass a lot.  I worry less and less. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  For this show.  Yes.  You think...  Was that the worst thing you had to do for the show?  Dr. Steve's finger in your rectum?  Did you just...  Seeing Elvis being called a fatty and...  When you came to Sirius, and they said the rule here is there is no insertion, were you  like, yes!  Yeah, but then the verbal insertion was not on the list.  You didn't realize coming here, they said no insertion, but that didn't mean the dicks  in the ass would stop.  Yeah.  Well, Roland, I mean, it is starting to, you know, wonder when you're lying and when 
[03:37:30]  you're telling the truth, but I guess, as long as the guests are coming in, you're doing  your job, right?  Yeah.  Like, that show's great.  Right.  So, what are you worried about, right?  Yeah.  I mean, look, Joey Fatone was in here, the Russian dolls were in here.  I know.  What do I have to worry about?  I know.  And then, uh, the other three ladies may be coming in September for you. 
[03:38:00]  You working on that?  Yeah, it looks really good.  See?  It's not lying.  And that's what I'm saying.  You know what?  As far as I'm concerned, based on, like, I don't want my fiancÃ© to lie to me because  I have a relationship with her.  Yeah.  But, like, you're like my boy, I work with you, you hook me up with some guests and whatnot.  What difference does it make if you lie to me?  Yeah.  What do I care?  As long as you're not hurting me?  Yeah, but you're chicken nuggets.  Yeah.  Well, you came back yesterday with Burger King with some chicken tenders for me. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, boom.  Here you go.  So, then lie to me if it makes you feel better.  Whatever.  See, what I'm saying is I don't lie to you because you bust balls hard.  Right.  Because when you bust balls, you could catch a lie.  Exactly.  And we're just looking for the other one to slip up.  Yeah.  Mars, let's talk about what you wanted to talk about.  I did want to play first.  Joe McHale went late yesterday.  Very late.  Great interview, by the way.  And great booking, Roland.  But we didn't get a chance to play this.  This day in O&A history. 
[03:39:00]  Yesterday was this day.  But we didn't get to play it yesterday.  So, we're going to play it now.  And then, Mars, I would like to hear what your issue is.  Okay.  Okay.  Sounds good.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents, presents, this day in O&A, our favorite moments from  this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  It was on this day back in 2007, our own Eric the Sex Bagel Nagel, physically and possibly  sexually assaulted adult film starlet, Justine Jolie.  Uh, E-Rock, you ready to go or what? 
[03:39:30]  Am I getting spanked?  Please, please, please.  How do you want it?  Oh, there we go.  How about right there?  All right.  E-Rock.  Wait, E-Rock, you've got to give her some loving first.  You know how this is done.  All right.  Rub it a little bit.  Rub it a little, E-Rock.  Kind of make it seem like you're into it.  Yeah?  No, E-Rock knows.  Yeah.  He knows.  All right.  There she goes.  All right.  There's a little rubbing going on.  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Motherfuck you! 
[03:40:00]  E-Rock!  You cocksucker!  Son of a bitch!  E-Rock!  Ow!  Oh, that gives me a fucking bruise, mate.  Look!  Are you shitting me?  Holy shit.  Good thing I have.  That is so fucking funny.  This has been This Day in ONA in ONA.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  That's right, here on the After Show.  Eric, was that a proud moment for you?  Yes, one of my prouder moments. 
[03:40:30]  Now, Justine Jolie, that's the one that your wife has now said you're not allowed to have  any interaction with, correct?  She's hot, though.  My wife hates her.  Why?  Because, I guess, I'm trying to remember.  Justine Jolie said shit about my wife on the air.  Oh, she did?  My then-fiancee at the time.  So, yeah, she got pretty pissed off, so.  And let me tell you something.  Your wife is not a woman I would mess with.  No.  I mean, I think, Eric, I don't say this disrespectfully.  I think I can probably say that your wife firmly wears the pants in that household. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, she can fight.  Yes.  Yes.  And keeps the sex bagel in line from time to time.  That she does.  Yeah, well, somebody's got to, dude.  Oh, look at Roland make the which sounds.  Well, you're a liar, so you're no better.  Which?  Now, Mars.  Sir.  Your issue.  Is this what you came to me with before the show?  Yeah, I came to you because I see some injustice.  Okay.  It could be done purposely, or it could be just an oversight. 
[03:41:30]  But you feel like it's your duty to bring it up.  Okay.  You want justice.  Yes.  Okay.  You know, I just see it happening, so.  Mars is all right.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Mars.  Here on After Open Anthony Live.  Why don't you explain to the audience?  You're the engineer.  Yes, I am.  The mics.  What happened today?  Because out of nowhere, we were talking about Bruce the Barber Beefcake, and then all of  a sudden, the compression or whatever it was just disappeared.  What happened to the mics today, Mars?  Well, what's more important than what happened to the mics is that I took care of it, found 
[03:42:00]  the problem, took care of it.  Oh, my God.  So let's move on to the issue.  What happened?  Okay.  Now I really want to know what happened to the mics today.  New computer loading up some programs.  Lies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened to the mics today?  I'm telling you the truth.  Okay.  The truth is I just got a new computer.  Bumped the computer?  So I had to reload programs on my computer and, you know, programs that make my job be 
[03:42:30]  the easier or harder.  See, Mars, lies are necessary.  Lies are necessary, this job.  So you're trying to make your job a little easier.  No, actually, just, yeah.  That's a tool that I use every day.  But you had to reboot while the show was on.  Had to be done.  Why did you have to do it while the show was on?  You know, I needed something to do.  You couldn't have just waited until the commercial.  You could have. 
[03:43:00]  I could have, but...  You're a little bored.  You're like, I guess I'll just reboot right now.  He was excited.  He had a new toy.  Yeah, and I knew that this button here is supposed to do what I wanted to do.  But it didn't.  But it didn't.  When did you realize that the mics had gone out?  At the moment I did it, my friend.  You're like, oh shit.  Because it shows.  How many lies flowed through your head at that second?  Because...  Come on.  I was thinking of all of that.  You're like, yeah, the bags, we had the power outage of some, the rain.  I was trying to figure out... 
[03:43:30]  You gotta go to Roland for a good excuse.  You know that.  My door's always open.  I was trying to figure out how I could blame Sam's raise not being given to you.  Somehow.  Just figure something.  Just figure some shit out.  You gotta pull his strings.  He's in management.  Like, they tell you.  We're working on that.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's lies.  But, uh...  That's the paper you just passed me to say.  I didn't pass you.  Roland, the paper you just passed me line is never gonna work.  Oh, by the way...  Because you know that Opie especially, but Anthony as well, whenever they think there's 
[03:44:00]  something wrong with the mics, and there's usually not, they're gonna complain about it.  So, you had to know, as soon as that thing lit up that said, this has gone off the mics,  you were gonna find out about it immediately.  Immediately.  And you did.  And I did.  I did.  But it was taken care of right away.  But, um...  Let me get to, uh, Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Of course.  That's my boy.  He's desperate for those followers.  And I wanted to talk about his boy.  Who's his boy?  Uh, Troy.  His boy toy, Troy. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, Troy.  Troy...  If Troy's around...  TQ, TQ.  Troy's in charge of the sex buzzer in the morning, is he not?  Well, here it is.  The sex buzzer was basically, uh, brought about when it was requested by the show's hosts  that a buzzer went off.  And I'm not...  Eric, I'm not speaking out of turn, I hope.  When a buzzer goes off, whenever Eric actually shows up to work, this was, uh, during a period  of time, let's call it the last six years, when Eric never showed up to work on time. 
[03:45:00]  Right.  So, Opie said, alright, I want a buzzer played as soon as E-Rock gets here.  Uh, this morphed into also having a Twitter going along with it.  Not morphed, you just decided to take the liberty to do so, and said, you know what, I'm just  gonna publicly post something.  Actually, if we go back to the, to the show, somebody, I don't remember which host it was,  but one of the hosts said, there should be a Twitter.  And Eric, it is my job as a producer, when the show host wished for something, to produce 
[03:45:30]  it.  Uh-huh.  And I did just that, uh, and so the sex buzzer's been on Twitter.  Mars, now that we know what the sex buzzer is, what's the issue?  We also, uh, realize within our staff here...  Because, because, and I'm sorry, I didn't, uh, Troy, sap, makes a, uh, fires a buzzer.  Yes.  So that on your radio, you hear a buzzer as soon as Eric gets here.  Very accurately.  Yes.  Until about, I don't know, maybe a week now. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, no.  Um, I have to say on air that E-Rock has been coming in fucking early.  Well, what's early?  5.25.  Okay.  Okay?  Okay.  5.20.  That's early.  5.20 you see him?  Don't, oh, don't exaggerate, because listen, for Eric...  Don't lie.  For Eric, 5.45 was a plus.  Okay, 5.25, I saw that individual here today.  You've seen, you saw Eric Nagel here at 5.25. 
[03:46:30]  Exactly.  Okay.  Okay.  So, you know, we just drive on, I see him down the hall, because I could look, you know,  down the hall from the studio.  And he comes in, and, um, he, I also monitor him, because once he comes into the studio,  it's my time to exit, not because it's Eric, just because I'm done with what I have to  do in the studio, now he's got to come in and do his shit.  Well, today, the sex buzzer sounds off at 5.52.  This is why I didn't tweet it today. 
[03:47:00]  And I said to myself, what the fuck is that about?  And I thought I heard it earlier in the week.  That's right.  You did.  But I said, I could be wrong, you know, I'm just too busy, I'm not, I don't really care  about it, you know, so, but today I noticed that the kid walks in at 5.25 and the buzzer  goes at 5.52, so I was just wondering, Eric, is this, is this true, Eric?  I, I don't know, because I don't fucking pay attention to it.  Well, are there, I know what time I came in, but I have no idea when, what time are you  into?  No, no, you do, because.  No, I don't.  Yes, you do, because earlier in the week. 
[03:47:30]  On Monday.  You said, I was here way earlier than you gave me credit for.  While you were in the producer's studio, because it came up on the feedback, so then when I  started on the feedback, once I saw it there, and I go, what?  And then I looked at your, at your Twitter thing, I said, wow, that's wrong, and, and  then I spoke to you about it.  Well, at that point, an investigation was in place, because if the sex buzzer isn't accurate,  it's lost its integrity, and, you know, and then what are we doing?  Okay, so first of all, you heard the sex buzzer earlier this week? 
[03:48:00]  Yes.  Okay.  And it didn't jive with the time that I.  First of all, that's bullshit, because it didn't go off on Monday or Tuesday.  Oh, maybe it was earlier this week.  Like I said.  Well, today's Wednesday, so when did you hear it?  I didn't pay attention.  So, okay.  But you just said you heard it earlier this week.  Let's just talk about, okay.  But didn't you just say that?  I just said that.  Hang on.  Hang on.  I said it could have been.  Let's just, let's get your shit straight.  So, yo, before you confirm, you better get your shit straight.  No, let me say it's true, because the buzzer didn't go off, and it wasn't true.  I'll tell you why it didn't go off.  I'll tell you why it didn't go off.  That's not true.  Because when I saw. 
[03:48:30]  Wait, wait, wait, Eric, it is true.  By the time I saw Eric here.  The buzzer is in the log here.  For today.  On Monday, 8.15, and it went off at 5.54.02.  Thank you, you rock.  5.54?  I'm looking at it right here.  You can come and look at it.  Mars, post a Twitter account.  Sex Twitter slash Sex Buzzer.  If you don't mind.  When's it in the log for yesterday?  I'm pulling up Tuesday now.  Okay, well, Troy, you just said it didn't go off on Monday.  I don't see it on Tuesday at all, so it didn't go off on Tuesday. 
[03:49:00]  Okay.  But you said it didn't go off on Monday.  I thought it didn't go off on Monday.  It may be my mistake, but it didn't go off yesterday.  Well, then you owe Mars unapologize.  Well, then I apologize to Mars, but here's what happened today.  And that's because I didn't see Eric.  I didn't see when Eric came in yesterday.  Okay?  That's why I didn't send off the buzzer.  One word.  Just Twitter slash Sex Buzzer.  I come back here to the studio.  I didn't see Eric.  I went back to my desk.  He wasn't at his desk. 
[03:49:30]  Uh-huh.  And then when I saw him, that's when I set off the Sex Buzzer.  So what's the problem here, Eric?  Let's see.  Today, this went off at 5.52.11.  I think I was in the bathroom at that point.  Taking a shit or a piss?  Yeah, taking a shit.  Number two?  Yeah.  How was it?  Not good.  Why?  Burger King and Skirt Steak.  Yeah.  He says his bowel movements are bad every day, by the way.  Wait, Burger King and what?  I had steak last night.  And Burger King for lunch?  Well, because Roland had the mini burgers, so I had two of those yesterday. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, I've seen the commercial you're supposed to share with your friends.  And that he did.  So you had mini burgers for lunch and then a steak for dinner.  I had, yeah, a piece of skirt steak for dinner.  What did you have for breakfast?  Uh, no, no, wait, yesterday?  Don't lie to me, Eric.  No, yesterday, I'm thinking, yesterday.  Oh, yesterday, I think I had, uh, was that when we had the egg sandwiches?  No, it was Monday.  Oh, then nothing yesterday.  Nothing for breakfast.  I don't know how to eat that.  Because we left early to the BK. 
[03:50:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  What about the Subway sandwich I saw you eating?  I took a half a bite and threw it away.  No, I saw Eric eating a Subway sandwich.  I had that, too, and it was God-awful.  Okay, so you all say a Subway for yourself.  Whoever, that's a shit sandwich.  Now, what's the, why is Troy not seeing you in the morning?  I don't know.  If he's not at his desk, I'm not seeking him out.  That's true.  I mean, I'll say that it does seem like it's more Troy's responsibility to see Eric  than it is Eric's responsibility to be seen by Troy. 
[03:51:00]  But why am I, why do I have to find him?  That's your job.  Well, I'm setting up the studio.  I'm doing everything I have to do in the morning.  Well, I mean...  He's the asshole that couldn't get here on time.  Whoa.  And now all of a sudden he's showing up.  Now all of a sudden he's Mr. Fucking Responsible.  What happened?  Whoa.  Like, who talked to you that now you're responsible?  Wow.  What is the reason for the more regular...  Like, what happened?  Like, you were so defiant and didn't give a fuck about anything.  And now all of a sudden you're Mr. Show Up Here at 10.52 or 10.25? 
[03:51:30]  Huh?  I decided to come in.  Oh, you decided?  I...  You've been coming in, asshole.  That's not what I'm saying.  Why are you now coming in early?  I'm not attacking you.  Don't take that tone with me.  Well, I'm just...  Why all of a sudden do you give a fuck?  You didn't give a fuck before.  You were blatantly defiant before.  You were like, I don't care.  I'll come in when I want to.  I decided I was going to come in.  No, Eric, be honest.  I am being honest.  Who had a talk with you?  There's a reason...  No one had a talk with me.  You're coming in regularly 30 minutes earlier than you used to.  There's a reason why.  And on the air, he was blatantly like, I don't give a fuck. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, he said, I'm getting everything done.  Just tell...  Just explain the reason why you decided to start coming in early.  I just decided to start coming in.  That's bullshit.  That's not bullshit.  That is true.  No, it's not.  The hotline's ringing.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, why can't you praise Eric and be happy for him?  For doing his job?  For showing up when he's supposed to?  Yeah, be happy for him.  Get out of here.  I love you, Kenny, but get out of here.  It's club soda.  I know.  And Sam, who's the desperate one? 
[03:52:30]  What?  Desperate for what?  I don't understand what you're asking.  Well, you don't remember what you just said five minutes ago?  Obviously not.  Refresh my memory.  You said I was desperate for Facebook.  Yeah, you're desperate for plugs.  I'm not desperate.  But you ask people to plug your Facebook constantly.  No, I didn't hear it.  Mars does it out of the goodness of his heart, because he's a nice person. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you.  All right, well, Kenny, then I take that back.  I guess you're not desperate for your Facebook plugs.  Yeah, let's stop all the negativity.  Let's be positive.  Positive brings positive.  Well, around here, that's obvious.  There's no positive around here.  No?  It's all negative.  So let's start being nice to everyone.  But why don't people be honest?  Doesn't honesty bring something, too?  I mean, I'm happy that Eric is coming in on... 
[03:53:30]  Actually, I don't care what time Eric comes in.  I didn't care that he was late before.  I just thought it was funny.  I just...  Hey, nobody brought up who was late today, Sam.  Well, I called people to let them know I was late.  And Sam's late was even before when Eric was normally showing up.  Yeah, I got here around 525.  535, maybe.  But that's because I was stuck in traffic, and I called Travis and told him I'm stuck in traffic.  Yeah, and Troy, you're suspect, too, this morning. 
[03:54:00]  Your excuse was, oh, I had to take a hot, steamy shit.  But that's Eric's excuse, too.  I don't understand.  But I shit every morning.  You're allowed.  I purposely get here at 5 o'clock so I can go take a shit.  Kenny, is your idea of increasing positivity to just call up and accuse people of things based on nothing?  No, the point I'm trying to make is people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  Well, it's a good phrase to live by. 
[03:54:30]  But the issue now is whether there is integrity in the sex buzzer.  The issue with the sex buzzer ever existing was consistent lateness, not, you know, whatever lateness, you know, coming up every now and then.  Sporadic.  Sporadic is the word I was looking for.  Ironic.  Let's have some positive reinforcement.  Eric has been coming in early for the last week.  He's not early.  He's on time.  Yeah, Kenny, he's coming in on time. 
[03:55:00]  And your idea of positive reinforcement is to call in and say something nice about Eric and then bash everybody else.  I just wanted to call in the club show to Kenny.  That's fair enough.  That's what I was waiting for.  Thank you, Kenny.  So anyway, so regarding today, I didn't see Eric come in.  So it was my error.  But the first time I had seen him was when I set off the sex buzzer.  Well, I can't update that Twitter if I don't know that the buzzer is... 
[03:55:30]  And Eric's been known to sneak in the back way here so nobody sees him.  Remember, that was his thing for a while.  That's his old K-Rock trick.  To be fair, Eric, that is your old K-Rock trick, correct?  That was my K-Rock trick.  Okay, okay.  That's your old K-Rock trick.  But he's done it here.  He's done it here.  Why?  I remember he would have the intern have to carry his bag back to the office.  I remember that.  It's like, what?  Like, really?  You can't carry your own fucking bag?  That's awesome.  It's called smart.  Eric.  It's called lazy.  That's why he looks the way he does.  It's called jealous. 
[03:56:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Jealous, Troy.  Jealous that I didn't have an intern carry back my bag?  Really?  Really?  Stick your nose up a little more.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Oh, my gosh.  I love this.  He won't be allowed to have interns do that much longer.  Eric, if that joke gets you, too.  How come you're not coming in through the front so Troy sees you?  I come in the front every morning.  No, you didn't, because I was sitting there.  No, I saw him.  I come in, and that guy who sits right by the door says hi to me all the time.  Dennis.  No, I mean the front.  Like, do you pass the offices when you come in? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I go right into my office.  Okay, then how come nobody else sees him?  I see him every morning.  Yeah, but you're not there.  You're not there.  You're almost never there.  I mean, you don't have to be.  You're not late, but you're not there.  I'm here by like 5.30.  If you see him when he comes in, then he's late, because you're not there when he's, you  weren't here at 5.25.  No.  Well, I see him if I look up.  You see him.  If I'm looking up.  Right.  Because you're in this studio.  Right.  So you can see him through the glass.  Right.  He does come in next to the office.  I don't think he's lying.  I'm taking that on what Troy said. 
[03:57:00]  What's the problem with turning a new leaf over a new leaf?  And that's what he did.  No, I like that.  But I think that he should have more of a complaint with Troy's portrayal of him coming  in on time.  I would.  With the sex buzzer?  Yeah.  But I said it was my error.  I would have a problem.  I mean, I guess he doesn't, he just has so much not caring in him that I guess it's not  there.  But I would have a problem with you if I were Eric because I'd be like, look, you told  me to come in earlier.  Took me a little while, but I'm coming in earlier. 
[03:57:30]  That should be represented.  And it's not because you're, I would say to this, I was being criticized before for not  doing my job.  Now, Troy, you're not doing your job.  Okay.  But if I'm setting up the studio.  But your job was to buzz the buzzer.  So what's more important, setting up the studio for the show or making sure the sex buzzer goes  off on time?  Who told you to buzz the buzzer?  Okay.  Well, who's the boss?  Because I need to, I need to.  Oh, Opie told you to buzz the buzzer.  Well, then, then I'll ask Opie tomorrow.  What does he want?  The studio set up?  Or does he want me to throw off the sex buzzer?  I think he would tell you to figure out a way to do both. 
[03:58:00]  And then that's your job.  Figure out a way to do both.  Then, then sometimes this will happen.  Well, Eric, right now.  Yeah.  Two points for you.  Zero for Troy.  And that's great because I'm not even the one who complained.  I know.  Mars brought this up.  This was Mars' issue.  That's right.  And I will say.  So then Mars can set off the sex buzzer in the morning.  I'm going to say this.  And since you have, you have an accurate time that he's coming in, you set it off.  Mars, who won this one?  Mars.  You got to give it to Eric.  You got it.  I mean.  You're actually the winner here. 
[03:58:30]  But Eric, I do.  And it's not, I'm not taking shots.  Everybody thinks that like, I'm going for something.  I, I, I'm positive that there's some, there was a catalyst to you starting to come in  earlier because it's a regular thing now.  But he'll, he'll never tell you.  He'll, he'll, he'll just.  And it's probably nothing.  Right.  Like, it's just, that's just annoying.  But it's just, it's one of the, it's one of the many things that he just holds inside  and will never tell you.  I do to defend Eric.  He just did it because he just wanted to. 
[03:59:00]  I don't, that's not true.  That's bullshit.  That is true.  Something happened.  Somebody said something to him.  And I'm not saying that you're lying, Roland.  He might've told you that.  I have an idea what it is.  But he's lying to you.  I have an idea.  What do you think it is?  I have an idea that he may be getting some more responsibility.  Then all of a sudden he better get his.  That came after.  He needs to get his fucking act together.  You think so?  Because he looks like a fucking asshole coming in at five minutes before the show starts.  Wow.  Well, he does.  I mean, come on, dude.  Seriously, like, showing up five minutes before the show starts is like, really, dude? 
[03:59:30]  And then he expects somebody to give him more responsibility?  It was probably like, dude, what are you doing?  Eric, you don't have to say what it is.  Nope.  True or false, you are getting more responsibility.  That is true.  Okay.  Now.  It's amazing that all of a sudden.  Is, and it, I will say, but you know what?  Do you want the responsibility, Troy?  Fuck no, man.  Troy can't even handle the sex buzzer.  They're not going to give him that responsibility.  No, you're right.  I don't want to do it.  I'm a fucking, I'm a phone screener. 
[04:00:00]  I don't want that responsibility.  But I will say, and I mean, we don't have the buzzer to back us up here.  I see yesterday, 532.  Does that sound accurate?  Eric?  What?  I'm sorry?  Yesterday's time, 532.  Does that sound accurate?  I'm looking at the Twitter.  For me in.  Uh, no.  I mean, I was in before that, but within like the 520 to 530 range.  Okay, so 530, you'll, you'll agree to it?  Like, is that fair? 
[04:00:30]  Like, it's within minutes.  We'll call that if, uh, I'll, all right, I'll call that if you want to.  Okay.  I'll call that close.  Okay.  But Monday, I have 549 on the sex buzzer.  Yeah, that's, that wasn't accurate at all.  So where were you?  Because I was back here in the studio and you weren't in your office.  So where were you?  Well, sometimes we do show off the lights because it gets burning hot in the office.  Yeah, but no, the lights have been on all week.  When I come in, the lights are on.  No, in the morning, the lights are always on wrong.  See, I mean, it's just, there's just so much.  It's like, what is it?  Are you in, Roland?  Because I don't ever see you in the morning. 
[04:01:00]  So I don't know how you're vouching for Eric being in.  No, Roland was in early, he was in a little early today.  He was in early yesterday, for sure.  I saw you in early yesterday.  But usually you're, you come in around six.  He comes at like six o'clock when the show starts.  Which is, which is good.  Or sometimes 530.  But he doesn't need to be here at 530.  Now, okay.  Uh, August 12th.  So Friday, I have 538.  That's a fine time.  Are you going to argue it?  That's petty to argue that.  Right, okay.  Yeah.  Uh, and then last week. 
[04:01:30]  So I'm thinking around August 8th is when you started coming in, uh, on time regularly.  Because we're going to take that 540.  Last, whatever last Monday is.  So, okay.  So that's the day.  You started coming in.  So it was a week ago Monday.  Uh-huh.  That you've been coming in early.  Uh-huh.  Why on that Monday did you say...  I've already...  You're never going to get the answer.  It's going to be...  I've already told Troy the answer for this.  Uh, this wasn't on air.  He didn't want to believe it. 
[04:02:00]  So, you know what?  I don't need to defend my point.  You never told me the answer.  Well, tell it to me.  Don't worry about...  Tell it to me.  Don't worry about convincing Troy.  Like, if this is straight up the truth...  Yeah.  Then what is it?  And especially for a Monday.  I got up early because I wasn't feeling good.  Okay.  And then I was like, you know what?  I'm up already.  I'm just going to go in.  I remember having that conversation with you, but then...  Oh, then it was you then.  Okay.  I apologize to Troy.  No, no.  I believed you.  We just made fun of you for not being able to breathe. 
[04:02:30]  Maybe Troy didn't believe you.  I don't know.  But what made you decide to continue to come in early every day?  Just felt like doing it.  I don't believe that.  It's bullshit.  Um, I'm going to ask some of these people because people started calling in, uh...  I love that this...  Go ahead.  This captivates everybody here.  It is a captivating thing, Eric, because it seems...  It's fascinating and aggravating to everybody.  Well, look, listen, it's the same...  Because for so long, you were so fuck you.  Now, why all of a sudden do you care?  Eric, it's captivating. 
[04:03:00]  It's human.  Like, people are interested in this.  The same way everybody cares about what I have for dinner, everybody cares about why all of a sudden...  You care.  ...you started coming in early.  Interested.  Okay.  That's fine.  But when it starts getting to the point of aggravating people...  Troy's aggravating.  Then it's like...  Well, it's also...  I don't have to explain shit to anybody.  But it's also because it's frustrating when we're like, Eric, we're co-workers, we're working together.  Let me...  Why are you coming in early?  And you're like, oh, I...  Like, we know you're bullshitting and you're like...  It's bullshit.  ...just tell us. 
[04:03:30]  But you'll never get it out of him.  Uh...  I'm not criticizing...  Eric, I'm glad you're coming in early, you know, on time.  It's cool.  Uh...  Stop saying early, because he's on time.  There's so much venom.  Uh...  Line one, you're on the show.  After Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah, it's you.  Oh, man.  I love that.  Thanks, brother.  Okay.  Uh...  Line two, you're on the show.  Nine, seven, eight.  Yeah.  Aside from being a rat, Troy's only accomplishment seems to be... 
[04:04:00]  Criticizing other people, because he's got nothing to bring to the table on his own,  and he's a jealous little rat.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Well, thank you for the call.  Do you think there's accuracy in that, Troy?  I mean...  Do you get jealous that Eric is praised for things?  I could...  I don't care.  I don't care.  Well, you care, because you feel passionate about it.  No, I feel passionate that all of a sudden he gives a fuck when he blatantly said on this  show that he doesn't care.  Do you give a fuck, Eric?  It depends on what it is.  Well, do you give a fuck about this? 
[04:04:30]  This is your job.  Because before, a month ago, if I said, do you give a fuck, you would have said no.  Do you give a fuck?  There's still parts that I don't give a fuck about.  Do you give a fuck in general?  In general, I might give more of a fuck now than I did before.  Very interesting.  Trinity Leaf, bro.  Very interesting.  You're on the air now.  Why would you spend 50 minutes on this bullshit?  Well, because some people are interested. 
[04:05:00]  Troy is such a fucking baby.  Who gives a fuck what time does it?  Well, 4,000 Twitter followers.  Fucking Troy, you're going to get your head out of his fucking ass.  Hey, buddy.  Do you listen to the show?  Do you listen to the show?  I listen to the show every day.  Okay.  You know that I'm not the one that had this idea.  This isn't my idea.  I was told to set off the buzzer.  This wasn't my idea.  I pull the hairs out of my ass.  It's more fucking interesting than this shit. 
[04:05:30]  Well, it's Sam's show, so yell at him, not me.  Sam's shit show.  And why don't you play some fucking content like you're supposed to instead of talking like little fucking girls?  Listen, if I was supposed to be doing something that I'm not, don't you think somebody would have asked me to do it by now?  Sell some cookies, Sam.  Sell some cookies, buddy.  What does sell some cookies mean?  He doesn't like the show, but this jerk-off keeps listening, doesn't he?  Well, it's a good show.  Let's all be honest about it.  You're on the show.  We only got a couple minutes. 
[04:06:00]  You have to say the area.  Line four.  Yeah, they're all lined up with the same area code now.  Oh, really?  Sometimes that happens.  Say hello.  Got another.  Yeah.  All right, that's you.  You're on the air.  Whose vagina hurts this morning?  Whose do you think?  All of yours.  Well, not everybody.  I mean, you could have picked somebody.  That's why I don't go to the phones.  I know.  Listen, Eric, I would say, and by the way, to anybody who thinks this isn't interesting, 
[04:06:30]  tell me why as soon as I take one phone call, every single phone line lights up.  Every phone line.  That's the way it works.  Every time you've been in here, every time I take one phone call, how many phone lines  light up?  It lights up.  Every single one of them.  All right.  So relax with the nobody cares thing, because then put the phone down and change the channel.  Sway is still on Shade 45.  He does a great show.  So now, Eric, I would say congratulations, not only for the fact that you're coming in  on time, but I would say you outworked Troy.  I would say you outworked him, because he didn't do his job. 
[04:07:00]  I was doing my job setting up the studio.  You got two jobs, and you only did one.  That's 50%.  I could only be in one place.  How many jobs do you have, Sam?  150 at this point.  They all get done.  At least to some extent.  So, Eric, hopefully at one point you'll be on it.  Mars, I know you're an Eric supporter.  I'm an Eric supporter.  You don't believe Eric when he says there is no reason for him to start coming in early.  No, absolutely not.  There is a reason.  He's not telling you.  Okay.  He's just not going to tell you.  Well, hopefully we'll figure out what that is at some point.  Stay tuned.
