<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in their characteristic vulgar and rambling style, filled with profanity and sexual innuendo.  They launched into a discussion about the rise of Instagram video and the fall of Vine, continuing in the same crude tone.  Opie recounted a lavish Yankees game experience, detailing a luxurious seafood buffet and a terrifying motorcycle accident witnessed on the West Side Highway.  A brief discussion of LeBron James' NBA championship win followed.  Opie then graphically described a recent wisdom tooth extraction and his subsequent Vicodin use, sparking a conversation about planned dental work, including veneers, and a caller shared their own veneer experience.

A substantial portion addressed the hosts' absence during a scheduled interview with Ricky Gervais, which drew online criticism. Opie explained that Gervais' appearance was scheduled after the show's official end time. A phone call with Gervais was played, clearing up the misunderstanding.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a video of the Gervais interview and the hosts' frustrations with the show's production and editing. Jim Norton and Sam Roberts were present in the studio during parts of this segment.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Ricky Gervais' views on offensive jokes, particularly those about rape, referencing his Twitter activity and his belief that honesty shouldn't necessitate accountability.  The hosts debated the nature of offensive humor—whether the subject matter or the intent determined its offensiveness—and the difference between intelligent and unintelligent responses to sensitive jokes.  Gervais' experiences with audience reactions to jokes about the Holocaust and Anne Frank were recounted. A comedic song by Brent was mentioned.

A caller sparked a discussion about the TWA Flight 800 crash, prompting a debate about the official explanation (center fuel tank explosion) versus eyewitness accounts suggesting a missile strike.  Various theories, including potential government cover-ups and accidental military involvement, were explored, with callers sharing their perspectives.  The investigation's handling, eyewitness testimonies, the roles of the FBI and other agencies, and the book "TWA 800" by Jack Cashel were discussed.  The hosts also made humorous, crude comments about the attractiveness of Liam's interns compared to their own. A Doonesbury cartoon idea about interns was mentioned.  One host described a personal experience with acid and a hallucinatory hot dog.

Comedian Rob Bartlett visited the studio, bringing gifts (bobbleheads and donuts).  The conversation included Bartlett's awkward compliment to Bill Burr; the hosts' opinions on apps (Vine, Instagram); Opie's attempt to get a ticket lady to join him for a Yankees game; Opie's Vicodin discomfort; a discussion of a man walking across the Grand Canyon for a TV stunt; and a segment about Warner Wolf.  Comedian Colin Quinn called in to promote his shows.  Actor Jason Statham joined, discussing his new film "Redemption" (originally titled "Hummingbird"), career, and stunt work, including the risks involved (referencing the deaths of Brandon Lee and Jon-Eric Hexum), insurance concerns, and anecdotes from previous films like "Crank."

The conversation with Jason Statham continued, focusing on the safety of his stunts, experiences filming with Schwarzenegger and Stallone (including their extravagant trailers), his career path, the differences between British and American film industries, his opinions on various James Bond actors, and potential on-set conflicts, citing Charlie Sheen as an example.  The hosts discussed gun control laws in New York.  The segment concluded with plugs for Statham's movie, Rob Bartlett's show, and Jim Norton's tour.  A brief discussion of Instagram's video feature and a continuing feud with Dennis Falcone about donuts also occurred. Rob Bartlett remained in the studio.

The show's final segment featured Rob Bartlett and Dennis Falcone, discussing the radio industry, the changing media landscape, the differences between old and new broadcasting, career challenges in show business, the importance of hard work, and experiences with Don Imus and Eddie Murphy.  The evolving nature of comedy and content creation in the digital age was addressed. Daniel Bradbury was mentioned as an upcoming guest, and Eric Nagel's podcast was briefly mentioned. The running joke about donuts and Falcone's attempts to obtain them continued. Bartlett's viral Bob Ross parody video was discussed.  A listener called in seeking advice on breaking into the radio industry.  The conversation was replete with profanity and sexually suggestive language.

[00:01:30]  Objectional human beings, and I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony's old.  Go, go, I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking things, trying to get blown.  Don't come to play around, and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be, and don't worry about getting a shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh, yeah, on the edge of your hair.  Because you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.

Yeah, 50, yeah.  Now I'm Mike Tyson up in this pit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  We'll be right back.  Let's go. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:03:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I just imagine people listening to the music coming up and they're like, wow, it's a  little longer than usual and wondering, you know, we're probably talking about curing  cancer and stuff here in the studio.  We're just talking about Instagram and the Vine killer. 
[00:03:30]  The Vine killer.  Fuck Vine.  Fuck it in its asshole.  Whoa.  I finally got on Vine because I got on behind with this Samsung phone.  Yeah.  And, you know, I made a bunch of videos and some never even made it up there for whatever  reason.  I can't upload it.  And then a couple that I did upload, there's no sound.  And then everyone was helping me out, like trying to fix that shit.  And then Instagram pops up the video thing yesterday.  I'm like, goodbye.  See you, Vine.  Pretty cool. 
[00:04:00]  You saw the little update.  I click.  I like clicking on the updates, seeing what it is.  I don't just instantly update.  I got to know what I'm getting.  Right.  And I click it.  It's like, oh, Instagram now has video.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  15 seconds as opposed to six?  I'm very excited about this.  Make a major motion picture in 15 seconds.  Yeah.  I'm going to install it.  Yes.  Yes.  Do it right now.  It's going to fuck.  Vine is done.  Imagine twice the amount of Chippa.  Oh, boy.  Fuck. 
[00:04:30]  But the beauty is you can still do a six or seven second fucking video.  But Instagram allows you 15 seconds.  I think that's smart.  I think most people just don't have it in them to do a six second creative video.  Yeah.  It's very difficult.  Because you get the same shit over and over again.  Like just a bunch of reactions and just someone like screaming or something.  Yeah.  You know, and unless you're Jimmy doing Chippa or something, it's kind of tough to make that  six seconds entertaining. 
[00:05:00]  Will Sasso doing his lemon videos.  Right.  Right.  Very funny.  There's a bunch of guys out there that know what they're doing with it.  Yeah.  I'm going to do something with a lemon where I spit it out.  No, that's what Will Sasso does.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  But very exciting news.  And Vine had such a lead on this whole thing.  But they just, they took so long to get it, you know, get the app available for the Android  phones.  And it was buggy.  Well, they're a little startup.  And Instagram was established already.  Yeah.  And then they come in with this idea. 
[00:05:30]  And I kind of went away from Instagram for a little while because it was like, why do  I give a shit about someone's pictures when I can watch people's videos for six seconds  on Vine?  Right.  So you watch that and then Instagram comes along now and says, we got video.  Right.  Instagram.  Put a little Vine.  Instagram isn't playing, man.  No.  No.  They want to take over.  They're owned by Facebook.  Yeah, I know.  So they're even beyond.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they got all that funding now.  So they go, all right, here, take our fucking money and develop shit. 
[00:06:00]  We need some video.  Instagram's not playing around.  Yeah, developer or steal shit.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the world they all live in.  I've yet to make a Instagram video yet.  I saw Sam Roberts made one where he does pretty much a six-second video and then stares bamboozled  into the camera for another seven or so seconds.  I enjoyed it.  It was funny.  I did enjoy it.  Yes, indeed.  And what's the matter?  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Technical Jimmy.  Oh, you don't have the proper operating system. 
[00:06:30]  You got to.  Oh, no.  Syntax error.  Yep.  Line 320416.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  I just don't know.  I don't see where.  Did you update?  I just, I'm the update kid.  No, you're not.  I think you, uh, did you hit the camera and everything?  Like, ready to do it and then it'll give you the option?  Oh, I don't know.  Hit the camera.  Where's the camera?  I haven't done this before.  It'll give you the option.  Look at that.  Here it is.  There's a motion picture icon.  Fucking motion picture.  I don't know how to edit yet.  I haven't really fooled around. 
[00:07:00]  And.  What?  And, Jimmy, hit this.  Now you can look at yourself.  Well, I could do that on the other one.  I wasn't able to do it.  I wasn't able to do it on my fucking Android.  You could backwards, forwards cam.  Yeah.  I wasn't able to do that shit.  Sure, sure.  Unless I fucked it up.  Uh.  Oh, my goodness.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, Vine's done.  Yeah.  The death knell for Vine now that Instagram has decided to do this.  That's pretty.  But here's a couple of things I did hear from people saying, well, Vine, as opposed to Instagram, 
[00:07:30]  Instagram doesn't loop.  Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but they don't loop.  Like, it won't keep playing over and over again.  And sometimes that's kind of funny.  Right.  Some things do get funnier, especially if they're only six seconds in a loop.  The more you hear it, the funnier it gets.  I bet you they'll add that as an option.  Maybe.  Also, nudity.  Maybe they don't want to get sued by Vine.  Also, nudity.  No nudity allowed.  No nudity allowed on Instagram. 
[00:08:00]  Because they're a high-brow company.  Now, Vine could just turn into some smutty porno video.  It might be that way it'll do.  They could, you know, you always win with porn.  So that's one of the pluses for Vine.  I got a shitload of followers on Instagram overnight just because they added video.  Why?  Why are people all of a sudden following me?  They are going, I want to see Greg Opie Hughes in fucking 15 seconds.  15-second sunsets.  Exactly.  15-second sunsets.  Nice. 
[00:08:30]  I'm very excited because I really, I was excited about Vine, but it just didn't work on my  fucking phone.  And I had to stop making videos.  Yeah.  Because I'd make shit and then they wouldn't upload and, like I said, or wouldn't have sound.  And Instagram, I'm telling you, they're with Facebook and they're not playing.  They want to fucking make a move here.  I like these little technology things we get.  Something happens and everybody's all excited about it. 
[00:09:00]  It's wonderful times.  We're living in bros.  I was talking to my buddy, Buzzy.  We went to the Yankees game last night.  We're old friends.  We've been friends.  Is he a Muppet?  He is a Muppet.  How's that?  You know the buzz man.  I know.  We've known each other since 18 years old and he was talking about, he's in the 80s.  He's in digital media for cocks broadcasting.  He's, wait, for what company?  How do I make this work?  Cocksucker.  And he was saying this shit would fucking, it's like a 90 day shelf life for the most 
[00:09:30]  part with this social networking stuff.  You get a brand new thing that everyone's like, oh, fuck, I got to do this.  And it lasts about 90 days and then the next one comes along.  Except for your established ones, obviously.  Instagram, yes.  Twitter.  Twitter is amazing.  You know, but remember Foursquare?  That was a big deal.  That's still popular or no?  Not popular.  Any time I see somebody posting something on Foursquare, I'm just kind of like, why  are you doing that?  I mean, let's, Tumblr.  Pinterest.  Pinterest.  Which is for the house. 
[00:10:00]  House pen.  I was going to say, yeah.  LinkedIn.  The housewives.  They love Pinterest.  Pinterest.  They can pin up the dresses that they like and the shoes.  Oh, fucking bitches.  And recipes.  All right, we get it.  They love it.  My sister loves it.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's all about Pinterest.  I'm interested in that.  Let me pin it.  Pinterest.  I got to tell you, the ticket lady at Yankee Stadium, my God, man.  It's not her name.  Huh?  It's not her name. 
[00:10:30]  She's the ticket lady.  I know.  I saw her and I went, holy crap, ticket lady.  She's fantastic.  She is fantastic.  I love her.  And I promised I wouldn't beat her up on the air today.  No.  She's the ticket lady at Yankee Stadium.  Does she have you good seats?  Oh, my God.  First of all, you get the fucking whole experience.  Holy fuck.  How much does that cost?  I don't know.  It's fucking fantastic.  How much does it cost?  You sit down to dinner like a human being.  It's a massive all-you-can-eat restaurant that's just beautiful with Babe Ruth pictures on the wall. 
[00:11:00]  And I tweeted a couple pictures.  The seafood area alone with the lobster tails, the shrimp, the crab legs, and the shrimp as big as your fucking fist.  Huge.  You sit down like a human.  I've never seen so much seafood in my life in this one area.  How did you get there?  You checked your subway?  No, I drove.  You did?  Yeah.  The ticket lady took care of some fine parking.  Yeah.  I like taking the subway, though.  I take the subway.  The only place I really take the subway is the stadium. 
[00:11:30]  It's just so much.  I hate sitting in fucking traffic when you're leaving a big event for anything.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  It's like piles of fucking lobster claws.  It's like fucking delicious stuff.  Crab meat.  I want sushi.  Yeah, that's good sushi.  And you might think, sushi at a stadium?  What are you, crazy?  That is fine dining over there.  Sushi.  You get some of that fucking roast beef and shit on the carving board.  Oh, not all.  Look at that.  That's just a shellfish area. 
[00:12:00]  It's a wall of fucking shellfish.  Oh, my God.  Look at the piles.  Yeah.  I want sushi, and I'll tell you, the sushi was better than any restaurant I've been to  in our area by far.  You know, to a shrimp, that's like looking at fucking Nazi Germany footage of a mass grave.  Exactly.  Oh, that's terrible.  I'd be scared to eat shrimp there, but I guess it's good enough.  No, I'm telling you.  All fresh, all good.  Really nice.  Yeah, I ate that and sushi, and I'm fine today.  You see any celebs in there?  No celebs.  Oh, man. 
[00:12:30]  I've seen them every time I've gone in there.  I was excited to see some celebs.  A lot of media people I see in there.  Oh, I saw those.  News guys, yeah.  What the fuck?  And then I saw Giuliani in there one day.  He's just fucking standing right next to me.  Right.  Like, whoa, Giuliani.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, man.  That's the Yankees.  Whoa.  Ticket Lady rules.  Yeah.  I love Ticket Lady.  Who did they play?  I don't know.  I don't know.  The seats are so good. 
[00:13:00]  You're just sitting there so happy, and you're socializing.  You don't even care.  I'm not a Yankees fan.  I'm barely a Mets fan at this point.  Did Jeter play?  No.  But are you a mixed 98.5 fan?  It was the Rays.  I know who they played.  Yeah.  I left in the eighth inning, though.  Who won?  I don't even give a fuck.  It doesn't matter at that point.  Then my GPS decided to take me through the heart of the Bronx in the middle of the fucking  night.  Holy shit, I was a little scared.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not unreasonable, Anthony.  My views may be slightly different than yours, but I'm also not a fucking idiot. 
[00:13:30]  I hear you.  You know?  Because they wanted to get me on that cross Bronx Expressway.  I'm like, no.  Oh, boy.  So I started going south, figured my GPS would fucking set me up nice in a better way back  to Manhattan.  Sure.  I was on some side streets.  It was fucking scary.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you do.  You don't want to see Kennedy Fried Chicken ever.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And they have a lot of Kennedy...  That's like KFC says, we ain't even going in there.  Right.  You're going to have to get the imposter.  They got Kennedy Fried Chicken like we got Starbucks on the Upper West Side. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  They are sprinkled about, that Kennedy Fried Chicken.  I like the logo.  It's a chicken with his head blown off.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the picture I took from my seats.  Ooh.  Not many people there last night.  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  162 games and I don't know.  Baseball's in a slump right now, by the way.  They really are.  And isn't half the Yankees, aren't all the good players injured?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of injuries.  And also, just baseball in general is in this big kind of slump. 
[00:14:30]  No one really cares.  I guess Ron and Fez were talking about it yesterday.  Ron, he had some really good points about how people don't really care about teams anymore.  Like, they're there just to be at the park and the game and stuff.  But no one really cares anymore.  You go there for the social experience, man.  Yankee Stadium is amazing, what they've done with that place.  It's a beautiful mall.  It's beautiful.  It's restaurants.  Oh, my God.  And then there's a ball game going on or something.  Right.  If you don't enjoy the game, we have activities planned. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  Exactly.  We were talking last night.  You know, I'm a pretty big hockey fan.  And, you know, I was really mad when, you know, they went on strike or whatever.  And then they come back and only do 50 games, which made for an amazing season.  Because every game mattered.  More important, yeah.  And then you go to a baseball game and you're like, what?  It's mid-June.  Yeah, who cares?  They're going to play until October before it starts mattering.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, how could you get up for a game like this?  Very difficult.  Especially in this day and age when we're all just like, you know, no one focuses on anything anymore. 
[00:15:30]  We're just talking about social, you know, networking and social media.  It holds our attention for, what, a minute at a time?  Tops?  I know.  We all have ADD now.  But it was great.  I want to thank the ticket lady.  She was amazing.  It's a fun day and it was about nice weather and everything.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  That's why, even if you don't like, there's something just about being there and, you know,  seeing a game. 
[00:16:00]  Especially when you've got great seats like that.  Right.  You're able to go into the Legends little section there.  Oh, I was certainly fortunate.  And then, you know what's even good?  You were there, which is good because you're right by the entrance to the Legends.  Right.  You could just walk right around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So if you've got to use a bathroom or you want to get a beer and the beer guy isn't around.  Right.  I was just going there, go to the bar.  Right.  You get two fucking bottles of beer.  You could piss like a human.  Right.  And then you come back out to your seat.  Well, it all makes sense except for the price tag. 
[00:16:30]  Well, yeah.  I have no idea, but I can't imagine it's...  It's a lot.  It's a lot, right?  Yes.  It's like a ridiculous amount of money.  Yes.  I guess I'll be billed or something.  I don't know.  Oh, sure.  I don't know how it works with the ticket.  Sure.  I don't know how it works.  How much for the food, though?  You pay for it there, right?  No.  No.  All you pay for are your alcoholic beverages, even your sodas and stuff like that.  All free.  So you go...  It's not free.  It's included in the price of the ticket.  Right.  And then you go in there. 
[00:17:00]  You do this buffet.  You could stay in there all fucking day if you want and eat.  I could bring a gal there and say, let's go to the ball game, hon.  Oh, they would be so impressed.  We have a friend, Freddie.  You know Freddie as well, who I've known since I was 18.  Uncle Freddie.  He is all about teaching us how you eat at an all-you-can-eat place.  Oh, Jesus.  He's like, first of all, let's not touch the bread, fellas.  Don't fill up on that shit.  Don't fill up on the bread.  Right.  And then he's like, in these all-you-can-eat places, you go right to the seafood, the most 
[00:17:30]  expensive stuff, blow off everything else.  And then during the game, he just disappears because he needs another plate of food.  So he goes downstairs.  He's one of these guys that loves to eat.  Not a big guy, though.  Not a chub.  Yeah.  But loves to eat, man.  I don't know where it all goes.  But he was more about, you know, hanging out there and getting another plate of food.  Yeah, yeah.  Loading up.  And then I tried to avoid the ice cream.  Because then you go to your seats and there's coolers of ice cream. 
[00:18:00]  The junk, yeah.  For free.  It's self-serve.  It's amazing.  It's an amazing day when you go there.  I love the ticket lady.  Mm-hmm.  I've got to get my ass to some games.  It's just been so shitty out lately.  I forgot her name.  But I just called her the ticket lady.  I don't want to say her name.  I don't think she likes when her name is splashed out there.  Ooh.  It's Becky Sue.  Becky Sue.  Becky Sue, the ticket brood.  Becky Sue.  Good old Becky Sue.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, and then on the...  This just matters, I guess, locally. 
[00:18:30]  Then I'm on the West Side Highway and I see a little commotion up ahead.  Something obviously just happened and there's a cab, like, stopped in the right lane and  we get around and to watch a guy pulling a motorcycle off a dude who's just laying there  not moving.  Ow.  Would love to know what happened in that situation.  You got a little nail.  It didn't look good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, obviously.  I don't know if he caused it or hit something else, whatever, but it looked horrible. 
[00:19:00]  I know people love their motorcycles and stuff, but wow.  Just not for me.  No.  It's to the people.  I've said it before.  People will make left turns right in front of my giant SUV because they didn't see it.  Wow.  It's like, never mind a fucking motorcycle.  Crazy.  Yeah.  I like having a little steel around me.  Yeah.  The guy was just laying there motionless on his back.  I hope he's all right.  I don't even know who, obviously, who it is, but Jesus. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, say a prayer.  Light a candle.  God bless.  God bless.  LeBron got another ring.  I don't know why that bothers me so much.  I turned that off 27 seconds before the end.  Did you?  Yeah, I didn't care.  I wasn't being a dick, and I had other business to attend to.  I got home, and the Spurs were down five or six, and it just stayed at that five or six.  They were down seven points.  I'm like, you know what?  They're just not going to do it.  Yeah.  So I turned it off so I could get a little sleep in today.  Now, you say you're pissed that he got another ring and stuff, but the truth of the matter 
[00:20:00]  is, you win two like that, doesn't it kind of justify the guy?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, no, of course.  You can't take it away from him.  Yeah.  It all comes back to how he left Cleveland, that's all.  He had every right to go to Miami, which I've argued that's a point with people on Twitter,  because that's their point.  I'm like, yeah, I know he has every right to go to whatever fucking team he wants to  for the sake of his talents and his family and all that, but it was just the way he left 
[00:20:30]  Cleveland.  When he set up that press conference, Cleveland just assumed, oh my God, he's just making  a big deal to stay here.  Yeah.  Whoops.  He spanked all those guys in Cleveland.  It was a big fuck you to the city, how he did it.  Whatever.  But of course it validates him.  He's got two championship rings now and two MVP awards.  But he's got to get up to five or six before they start comparing him to the great one.  You need a dynasty, huh? 
[00:21:00]  You need a little dynasty.  Sort of a dynasty.  Yeah.  You know, two in three years, two in a row, you know.  But, I mean, it was tough for him this time around.  We'll see.  Good for him.  Whatever.  Fuck.  I went to a dentist there yesterday.  I saw you tweeting.  After the show.  Went there, had my wisdom tooth yanked.  Not because it was, like, bad or anything.  They'd grown in fine and I have the other three and they grew in all nice and everything. 
[00:21:30]  But this one, for some reason, just fucking self-destructed while I was chewing on a burger and looking at Jimmy Norton.  And so I went and, god damn, those fucking wisdom tooth roots.  Like, I think I felt some tugging on my retina.  Oh my god.  Holy shit.  There is something that goes on when you are having a tooth pulled like that where you have to disembody yourself from what's happening to you. 
[00:22:00]  Oh my god.  You have to fucking not think about what is going on.  The sounds, the fucking feelings, the movements of the dentist.  You can't fucking think about it or you'll lose your fucking mind.  You didn't have gas or anything?  What did they give you?  Well, I did a little.  I farted twice.  Take us out, pig.  No.  Jesus.  Wow. 
[00:22:30]  It's so blatant.  Oh my.  Yeah, they shoot you up with the Novocaine.  I just, I like the local anesthesia.  I'm not fucking, you know, one for give me the gas or fucking, you know.  If you ask, they'll even fucking put an IV in you and you'll be out, totally out.  But I'm just like.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  A dentist?  Yes, for a, well, it's not, it's an oral surgeon.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  So.  An anesthesiologist?  Yeah, they got the whole deal.  If you, if you, if you're like, you know, I cannot do this under local, you could get a general and they'll fucking, you know, put an IV in. 
[00:23:00]  You'll sit there and, yeah, even the chair that you're in, it's got that, the flat board armrest with the Velcro strap.  So, you know.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Some people can't take it.  The propofol your ass?  I don't know what it is.  Probably.  The Michael Jackson juice?  Yeah.  Because, like I said, some people, if you can't put your mind in another place when that shit's going on, it's, it's literally like you're painlessly being tortured. 
[00:23:30]  It sounds odd, you know, like torture needs a pain, but the mental aspect of the sounds and what's happening, you're hearing shit snapping in your fucking head.  He, he's, he's like, you might hear some crunching.  And then there's, there's these metal instruments.  Your mouth is open so wide and, and the corner of your mouth is being pulled back.  Like that hurt more than, he novocaines your, your tooth, but it doesn't novocaine the corner, the little webbing in the corner of your mouth.  Right.  And there's metal pulling on it, like back, it's like, all right, that's fucking uncomfortable. 
[00:24:00]  And then there, he's making these clanging and screwing in noises and stuff.  And then you hear this, and then it went and snapped like, like, like a bone breaking.  And then he's drilling, I guess he's got to drill a hole up into the roots.  And then he takes this self-tapping screw thing, screws it into the root.  And then you feel him like, like, you know, when you get a corkscrew, a corkscrew and the cork is a little tight and you're pulling, but you can't just yank it. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  You got to do that slow, steady pressure.  Or the cork will fall apart.  He's doing that to my fucking, the roots in my teeth.  It was, so you got to sit there and kind of be like, all right, all right, this is happening, but I'm not feeling it.  So it doesn't matter.  Holy fuck.  Your face isn't swollen.  No.  Does it hurt?  Yeah.  I, I, I have some fucking, um, I have some fucking drugs that, that, that's in my, uh. 
[00:25:00]  Some vitamin V?  Some, uh, Vicodin.  Vitamin V?  A little Vicodin.  I was, I took, I took, uh, one of those last night with a little glass of wine.  It was nice.  Are you supposed to do that?  Nice.  Yeah, it's on the bottle.  It said, take with glass of wine.  That's a good combination.  And then drive.  I've never had Vicodin.  I have.  Is it good?  I wouldn't say it was good.  It's not all that good.  It's, it's all right.  It does.  A lot of people get addicted to it.  I might take one, as a matter of fact. 
[00:25:30]  Or it does hurt.  Like, I feel it.  Are you going to be all loopy?  My throat hurts, too.  It's like the, I'm sure.  The right half of my throat, when I swallow, hurts.  And then the side of my mouth, like where he was fucking tugging.  So wait, is this the tooth that fell apart so they're not fixing it?  They got rid of it?  No, they yanked it.  Gotcha.  It was a wisdom tooth.  It was split right up the middle.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he said, he goes, the root was so long.  He goes, it went up into your sinuses.  He goes, so now there's like a hole that's got to close up between your sinuses and the 
[00:26:00]  hole in your fucking gum now.  Did they show you the tooth?  No, it was in pieces.  But I would love to see the root of a tooth like that.  So he says that.  So he goes, he goes, so now, and you know how much I love to blow my fucking nose.  He goes, you can't blow your nose.  So here's some afrin.  So shove some afrin in your fucking nose.  For how long?  A couple of days.  Is that because the blood is trying to clot?  No, the pressure of blowing will blow some fucking air and snot and shit down through 
[00:26:30]  my tooth.  Jesus.  I guess.  Through the hole until the hole closes up.  I'm wondering, because you can't smoke either.  That's how you dry socket.  Well, they don't like any kind of suction.  Right.  So using a straw or smoking isn't good for the opening there.  It kind of pulls things out.  Yeah, that's when you dry socket, which I think on the bottom is worse because it's  harder for the blood to, I guess, whatever, coagulate or whatever happens to happen on 
[00:27:00]  the bottom.  I think that, is your top or bottom one out?  It's top.  I think it's a little easier to heal.  Top passenger side.  Yeah.  Bam.  I think those are easier.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  It's not a fun thing.  And then that whole, well, make sure you chew on the opposite side.  I'm like, I'm not even going to bother eating.  Right.  This is a hassle.  This is a hassle.  Can we make today Vicodin and Donut Day?  Vicodin and Donut Day.  You know, Sam Roberts, I know you don't like me. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, sweetie.  Don't check your Twitters.  Oh, look at that.  Dry socket.  That's what I call my wife.  Very funny.  Jersey Mike.  Yeah, that's sexist.  Bravo.  Online feed is down.  Don't check your Twitter.  People are really mad.  What happened?  Again, it's down?  People have been calling.  We know.  That's such a shit.  How does...  Yumping e-hosts of fat.  The guys here, I know, bring the message and try to get...  It's not this building. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Who...  Don't they farm it out to another company?  Or however they do it?  I like to think that there's a lot of people using it.  Wow.  And it's crashing it.  Yeah.  That's how it makes me feel better.  Because it seems like ours is one of the only ones that crashes.  But it shouldn't...  Shouldn't they have fixed it already?  Or is the whole app crashing?  I think the whole app is not working today.  My Vicodin.  No, that's the penicillin.  They gave me penicillin.  Right.  You know, because they...  Oh, there it is.  All right.  You're taking one now? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, let's take a little Vicodin.  Yeah.  Now it's Papa Molly.  Let's Papa Molly.  Who's with me?  Whoo!  You're going to be a little loopy?  Nah.  I'm fine.  I know how to handle my drugs.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm on it.  Yeah.  And we got any weed?  Are you done with the dentist now?  Mm-mm.  Oh.  That was phase one.  Jesus.  I'm in a lot of phases.  Right.  I got to go back to the regular dentist.  That was the oral surgeon.  He's just there to yank shit out or fucking root canal shit. 
[00:29:00]  And he's just right upstairs from the other dentist, so it's not like you got to go all  over what they call hell's creation.  So now I go and I have all the amalgam, amalgam replaced in my mouth.  Those are all those ancient fillings that they used fucking like heavy water and fucking  uranium in your fucking teeth and fucking toxins and dioxin.  Yeah.  So all those, she just drills them out, shoves the nice white shit in there. 
[00:29:30]  And that's kind of a pain in the ass.  I had that done.  Yeah, it is.  That's not going to be fun either.  No, it's not fun.  And then I probably need a few more new crowns.  All the crowns and stuff that I have in my yap, they're all from like the early 90s.  Wow.  But they've hung in there.  They're pretty good.  But I'm going to have all those replaced.  And then, Opie, not to frighten you.  I know you're very frightened of this.  No, don't do it.  I can't.  I won't be able to look at you. 
[00:30:00]  I'm not getting caps.  I'm not getting implants.  Although, fucking nice B cup or C would look great on me.  Fuck yeah.  I'm not kidding.  You're supposed to go, what do you mean, would look?  But I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm considering.  False teeth.  No.  Oh, boy.  Veneers.  Veneers. 
[00:30:30]  These things are ultra thin things that they go over the front of your teeth.  They adhere.  They're permanent.  They go over the fronts.  So they match the line of your teeth and everything.  And it just covers up, you know, any irregularities, staining, things like that.  So you're going to come in here with really white teeth one day?  No, because they also make it the natural color of healthy, nice teeth.  No, get fucking, get picket fence white. 
[00:31:00]  You want that?  Get 1950s movie star white.  Oh, God, no.  Yes.  We see those celebrities when they come in.  They look ridiculous.  The best.  It looks good if you're on TV or whatever, but when you're walking around, you look like  an idiot.  I'll be like to my dentist, could I have the Nimoy, please?  I want the Nimoy.  You're going to have hair plugs and dentures?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  They're not plugs, first of all.  Wow.  These are individual follicles placed artistically in the natural direction your hair grows. 
[00:31:30]  And I've had them for years now.  Okay.  And they're not dentures.  These are laminants.  They're right over the front.  Beautiful.  People that have them, you wouldn't even know they have them.  So, you know.  How long will this take, this whole process?  Oh, my God.  Probably 22 years.  Oh, see, that's a little shorter than I thought.  I'm thinking a long time.  I thought like a year per tooth.  No, I would think with everything that need be done, it's probably going to take a few 
[00:32:00]  months, you know, to complete everything.  Because I probably, you know, with the caps and stuff and everything else in there, you  know, the mechanics of it before the, you know.  I think a lot of people are surprised that you need this much work done in your mouth.  Well, it's not crazy now.  You have the means to take care of your teeth all these years.  You know what?  You're all in.  I, because I always need this incentive, something to happen.  This tooth cracking gets me into the dentist office. 
[00:32:30]  Sure.  Once I'm in there, then it's like, all right, let's roll with it.  Let's go.  But before that, I would just sit, you know, be like, all right, this is okay.  We got a guy that has false teeth.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg, you got the false teeth, huh?  No, I got veneers.  Yeah, the false teeth.  Right, the dentures.  The dentures.  They're not dentures.  What can Anthony expect with dentures, Greg?  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  This is either, no, they're very cool. 
[00:33:00]  Or this will be horror story, guy.  But then it'll, no matter what it is, it'll be followed up by the call that says, that  guy that called about veneers, he's full of shit.  That doesn't happen.  It isn't the case.  Don't you worry.  One of the next two phone calls will be on your side.  Exactly.  And the other one will be completely against it.  Right.  Exactly.  Greg, go ahead.  So, I mean, false teeth, you take them out at night and put them on a nightstand.  Like, my teeth don't come out of my head.  Exactly.  You know, so my teeth worked crooked, and I had, you know,  not solidified, but I had tetracycline, so my teeth were kind of stained from that. 
[00:33:30]  No matter what you do to try to wipe something, it doesn't work.  So, I killed two birds with one stone, and I had...  Oh, cruel.  And, uh, I'll tell you what, it's the best thing I've ever done.  It's a big belt, you know, so they kind of take, they take about a millimeter off the  front of your teeth, and they put temporary veneers on there to make a cast.  Uh-oh.  What do you mean they take a millimeter off?  They kind of...  They have to shave your teeth down?  Well, the front's to get a nice adhering surface. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, that's not going to hurt.  No, it doesn't hurt.  No.  It has to hurt, them scraping a little bit of your...  No, as long as they don't get to the pulp.  Oh, fuck me.  No way.  I like my teeth with pulp.  Yeah, just a millimeter.  Yeah.  A silly millimeter longer.  I'm sure this is how...  A silly millimeter longer.  Yes, it did.  That was Benson and Hedges, I think.  Oh, good for you.  So, what's the veneer?  Oh, good for you. 
[00:34:30]  Stop bragging.  How do you know that?  It's not even fun anymore.  It's frustrating.  I don't know.  How does your brain work?  It's weird.  It's terrible.  This is how Liberace started, by the way.  Is it?  Yeah, shaving down the teeth a little bit.  I got my veneers.  Do you like them?  Do you like them, everyone?  A couple hair plugs.  Fast forward.  He's got the false teeth and the, you know...  I'm going to make Sam Roberts...  And the young lover.  I'm going to make Sam Roberts get fucking corrective surgery.  To look like you.  Fucking hair and fucking laminants. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, God.  Wait, which intern would get plastic surgery to look like us?  How cool would that be?  Oh, my God.  That would be cool.  All of our interns now have to.  Even some of the old interns.  Creep Pie might do it.  Creep Pie Jones would do it.  Because he has to change his image anyway to get a job.  Right.  Because of the videos that are out there.  Do you put the veneers in a cup of water when you go to bed?  No.  See, they're permanently adhered to your teeth.  These aren't false teeth.  Hold on.  They don't come out.  Hold on.  Here comes the call.  Tom in Texas.  Tom.  Oh, hey. 
[00:35:30]  And when you're doing the veneers, my mom used to be a dental assistant when I was a kid.  It was every last little experiment on our teeth and everything.  But on the veneers on your front teeth, the problem with that is, is that since it's a biting surface, they have to actually wrap the veneer back around the back of your tooth.  Otherwise, if it's just on the front, eventually it'll pop that thing off. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And, yeah, so just make sure they do that, okay, bud?  All right.  I assume, yeah, they know what they're doing.  They'd have to fix veneers.  Veneer.  Without that, how would Vin hear anything?  Fuck.  Yo, what happened with the Ricky Gervais yesterday?  Fucking Instagram that.  Yeah, I'm going.  You're wasting good stuff.  What happened to Ricky Gervais yesterday?  Oh, my God.  And why are people giving us shit?  Because we left at 10 o'clock.  You guys fucking blew Gervais off again?  Vin, you're fucking lazy. 
[00:36:30]  Well.  You left early again?  No.  We might have, this might be the third time we've left on Ricky Gervais.  It's just worked out that way.  But, first of all, I blame Roland.  Oh, he's not going to be happy with that.  I blame Roland.  Why would he do that on a Friday?  Because Roland never told Ricky that this show fucking ends in 10.  Why wouldn't he tell people that?  Because then they would be like, oh, I don't want to do another show.  I want the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:37:00]  And then they might not come on.  Or he doesn't want to seem like he's getting a second rate show.  No offense.  None taken.  All right.  But he wasn't told.  So the past couple of times when either me or you or both of us have not been here during his interview for him.  Mostly for him.  Yeah, because he shows up.  It mostly happened for him.  Because he only books after 10.  This is, I think, the third time we weren't here.  But, yeah, I think what happens is he goes, yeah, I'll come at 10.  And then Roland goes, okay, yeah, sounds good. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, good.  That's good.  Oh, man.  That's good, Lee.  Roland's going to be pissed.  Well, this is the fact.  What are we going to do?  Why is he going to get mad at the fact of the matter?  The fact that he's booking people at 10 and not telling them that it's not the Opie and Anthony show after 10.  So Gervais comes in.  He sits down.  Wait, by the way, it was a last-minute booking.  Yeah.  And I have to just defend myself.  I went and got an MRI yesterday on this stupid shoulder that's killing me.  And I was absolutely, and I even said to Jimmy, I'm like, yeah, I'm fucking staying.  I want to see you the other day. 
[00:38:00]  And then the only opportunity I would get after this tooth thing cracked on me was to go in yesterday at 11.  And he also knew he could have come in today, too.  Like, the role is that he almost switched to today.  Well, we should get the facts out there because then we felt bad yesterday.  Of course.  And Roland goes, well, you know, would you guys stay late tomorrow, meaning today, Friday?  I'm like, yes, of course, but I can't blow off this MRI.  I've been dealing with a horrible shoulder for about six months, finally decided to do something about it.  I go, yeah, we'll stay late Friday then.  It'll work out for everybody. 
[00:38:30]  But then Ricky decided, no, I've got to do Thursday.  So he comes in, and believe me, he is in the complete competent hands of Jim Norton and Sam Roberts.  I listened to the interview.  It was great.  It got into the whole thing of freedom of speech and censorship and how comedians have these rules now that they have to adhere to that other people don't.  It was a fascinating interview.  Very good.  Very well done.  But early on the interview, it was just, let's bash Ovi and Anthony for not being here on their own show. 
[00:39:00]  But he really, honestly, he wasn't angry.  I know.  I could tell.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Now, now.  You should read your Twitter feed because people didn't.  Right, right.  A lot of people didn't pick up on the vibe that he wasn't actually angry.  Unbelievably stupid people.  That's what amazes me.  Well, they're dopes.  Couldn't figure it out.  Thank you.  Say it.  Did you hear the last thing when Anthony called it?  That wasn't a fake laugh.  Yeah.  It was, it was.  People were writing, whoa, Ricky's giving you two a beating.  And they meant it, too.  Morons. 
[00:39:30]  Dopes.  Morons.  They're just dopes.  And the fact that most people on the internet are fucking morons was also a topic of conversation yesterday.  Yes, exactly.  I heard that, too.  So, so, so, Ricky's talking about how, you know, why do we get paid what we get paid when we're not even here?  Well, we question that.  We don't even show up for a run.  I question that many times.  We don't stay for our own show.  It was like, Ricky was going off.  It was hilarious.  So, I'm driving home.  And Jim and I defended you guys.  Oh, yeah.  You son of a bitch didn't stick up for us? 
[00:40:00]  We did.  They were agreeing with Ricky.  Oh, we couldn't have agreed faster than hardly.  Wow.  They were selling us out horribly.  These two threw us under the bus.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  We didn't throw you under the bus.  But I would say Sam grabbed your hands and I held your feet while the bus passed over you.  Over and over again.  Yes.  Can you back up a few more times, please?  Ricky Gervais Express, the local.  Yeah, it was funny.  So, I'm driving home and I'm listening and I'm just like, no, I can't. 
[00:40:30]  Look, it's funny and all, but I want to set this record straight.  So, I call up.  I get on the phone and I tell Ricky, by the way, our show ended.  You're on another show.  We didn't leave early.  We didn't fucking blow you off.  You're booking your time here when our show is over.  And then I kind of put an example to him.  I'm like, you don't get an invitation to go on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and tell Jay he's got to stay late to do the show because you're coming an hour after he fucking, you know. 
[00:41:00]  But you did it in a Ricky Gervais British accent.  Of course I did.  Where's this clip?  I want to hear it.  I had to.  Do we have this clip?  Hang on.  I'm looking for it.  What are you doing?  Hang on.  I'm looking for it.  We rock.  And he's in for an hour.  So, that's a lot to look at.  Yeah.  Ricky, he was laughing.  I understood.  And it was all in fun.  The guy's fucking great.  And believe me, no offense to you two, but I'm certain he could sit here with a cinder block and a gardening tool and still be as fascinating.  No, why would we be upset about that? 
[00:41:30]  No offense.  No offense.  But two retards.  Absolutely.  One did.  Yes, exactly.  Ricky's just fucking great.  They did our job yesterday, and that's what you're...  I know.  Wow.  I know.  That's the thanks they get.  That's the thanks they get.  Wow.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But he gave a really good...  He's just...  I think he's my favorite guest.  Absolutely.  He's great.  He can talk about anything.  Yeah, he's honest.  And I knew he would enjoy talking about that, because on Twitter, he's really... 
[00:42:00]  Again, for a guy who's being talked about to host the Oscars...  Right.  He's fairly...  He's pretty fearless.  He kind of says whatever he wants, and, you know...  Has real opinions on things.  He has real opinions, whether they're...  Whatever they are.  And his take on it is the fact that, like, hey, if I'm being honest, they can't really  do anything to me.  Yeah.  Like, and sometimes that gets dangerous, you know, because you could think your honesty  is just being honest.  Meanwhile, ah, you're offending people.  He had the...  Sorry to interrupt you. 
[00:42:30]  He had the best line I've heard in our free speech discussion.  I wish I'd come up with the line.  Oh, yeah.  It was...  Collateral damage.  Offense, yes, is the collateral damage of free speech.  Yes.  I thought, what a fucking great way to phrase that.  And it is.  Sure.  Some people are going to get hit with some shrapnel when you have free speech.  I should have that tattooed.  The first letters of each one of those tattooed on me with a period at the end.  I thought it spells douche.  Wow.  Ah, we got the phone call.  All right, good.  Oh, okay. 
[00:43:00]  Let's go to the phone call that Anthony just described.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  He rock comment.  Oh.  Actually, we have a phone call.  Oh, really?  Anthony.  Anthony's on the phone.  He's doing it.  Anthony, welcome to the show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Very nice to speak to you.  Rick, your face.  Hi, boss.  I'm going to have you on the program today.  I'm driving, and I'm listening to you.  And Ricky doesn't seem to understand. 
[00:43:30]  First of all, we've been there for our show.  Oh.  You book yourself to our show after our show's over.  Oh, really?  I would love to see you do that.  Like, hello, hello, Jay Leno.  Yeah, that's all night until, like, midnight.  So, man.  No.  So, what are your hours, then?  So, this...  Well, I'll stay a little later.  I'll come on your show then.  But you'll be a fucking undelicated wanker if you're not there when I show up.  So, what's your hour?  What's your actual hours, then, of your show? 
[00:44:00]  Six to ten.  Six to ten.  So, I always come on at the end of your show.  So, I always just think you've left.  Oh, that's amazing.  Oh, I feel that.  I feel that.  I owe you an apology.  You keep booking yourself after our show's over.  Oh, hello, Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, what time's your show over?  I'll drop on by.  Oh, that's amazing. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, so I should...  What time should I...  I'm sure I should get her at nine next time, then, should I?  Nine would be perfect.  For Joe, Ricky, nine would be great.  And I didn't mean those things at all, boss.  I'm hoping the tooth is fixed and you're healthy.  And right as Dodgers for this afternoon.  Oh, you guys are laughing my balls up.  Have fun, Ricky.  I'll see you next time.  See you later, man.  Maybe I'll stay after school.  See you about a quarter to ten next time. 
[00:45:00]  Have a good time.  Cheers, bye.  See ya.  That's great.  That's funny.  Yeah, and then they went into...  That's really funny.  And then you guys got on Roland a little bit, which was nice.  I like the fact...  They're like, well, the fact is, Roland doesn't tell these people that the show ends at ten.  You're putting Roland in a bad mood.  Hey, this is what it is.  If Roland wants to get in a bad mood, I'm sorry.  I love Roland.  He knows that.  But this is what it is.  And I'm not getting on Roland. 
[00:45:30]  It's just what he's done.  How could Ricky Gervais not know the hours of the Opie and Anthony show when he's booking  himself at ten or saying he could come in at ten and doesn't know the show is over at ten?  Who is supposed to relay that to Ricky Gervais?  Hi, I want to come on at ten.  Hello.  Hello.  I'd like to come on at ten.  And you're told, okay.  Instead of, well, the show ends at ten, but we do have Jim Norton can stay, and we have 
[00:46:00]  Sam Roberts for the Opie and Anthony after show.  And we've stayed.  Yeah.  We've stayed plenty of times past ten for guests.  Or if you come in at nine or 9.30, the guys will be there, but the show ends at ten.  How does he not know that?  Someone didn't tell him.  Who's supposed to tell him?  Roland.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, boy.  It's not a bad thing against Roland.  Logically, it makes sense, but Opie's right on this one.  Is he?  Is Roland going to be mad at me?  Yeah, he's not going to be happy.  Because he digests that much differently. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  In his mind.  He's going to take that very personally.  How is he going to take it in his mind?  This is how Roland works, man.  After hearing this, he believes now that the president of this company is going to listen  to that and going to think that Roland is terrible at his job.  You've cost him every promotion he'll ever get.  Oh, no.  Has Roland seen the results we get by bitching?  Nothing.  No one listens.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  We're yelling into a vacuum.  Only we hear it.  It really is amazing.  Yeah.  Nothing gets... 
[00:47:00]  It's just amazing.  Nothing gets done.  Oh, boy.  Well...  There was a little cool video, too.  There was Ricky and I chatting about the...  First member?  First member, yes.  And every time I go to talk, it's edited.  What?  I like the way Sam edits these videos.  Oh, we edited you right out, huh?  If I was the one editing it, it probably would have said Ricky Gervais with Jim Norton and  Sam Roberts.  Oh, was that serious?  Ricky Gervais with Jim Norton.  Who the fuck edited this? 
[00:47:30]  I understand.  They were just featuring Ricky.  It's all in the editing.  I see my mouth get ready to move, and then it just kind of fades into more Ricky.  I'm like, what am I, a fucking...  What am I, just two ears?  Well, I mean, the video's doing very well.  2,500 views.  The listeners want to know how they can get that feature on the radio.  We should play this, actually.  Go backwards.  Backwards.  How long is it?  It's five minutes.  Six minutes?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, we could play it until break.  Could do that.  He is very good. 
[00:48:00]  And then Ricky Gervais is officially on the regular show.  The interview is...  He's made it.  He's made it to the regular show.  The interview is great, man.  Talking about the rape jokes and context of comedy and stuff.  He really is a smart guy when it comes to knowing the audience.  He's very savvy.  What?  Did he play?  Yeah, he did play.  What song did he do?  I missed that part.  I had gotten home.  Free Love on the Free Love Highway.  Oh, yeah.  He started playing that.  He didn't know the guitar was for him.  We started talking.  We were there for an hour. 
[00:48:30]  Free Love on the Free Love Highway.  It's amazing.  We fucking literally forgot to tell him the guitar was there, and I didn't get to any of my questions.  Did he make some faces?  No, I was just sitting here.  Me and Sam didn't say a word, because I'm like, I'm sitting next to David Brent while  he fucking sings Free Love.  How great is that?  Did he do the whole song?  No, he did the whole first verse.  I wanted to so badly in the middle go, like, she's dead, like Gareth did.  Right, right.  I couldn't interrupt him, and then he just kind of stopped and started laughing.  Wow.  We've got to get that clip up, huh? 
[00:49:00]  Gareth doing the background vocals.  That's what I kind of wanted.  She's dead.  She's not dead.  Yeah.  That was fucking great.  Well, let's play that, too.  Yeah, I don't know why they didn't post that clip.  I'm really told them to post both.  I have no patience anymore for this shit.  I understand, believe me.  I love doing this, don't get me wrong, but I have no patience for the nonsense that goes  down, goes on down the hall.  By the way, when we return, I would love to briefly discuss I am now a conspiracy theorist. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, right.  Yes, yes, indeed.  On one event.  On one.  Not all events, right?  There's a difference.  Yeah.  You've got to pick and choose, I think.  Yeah, I think you can.  Well, some of these guys, they can't.  They have to think conspiracy on everything that happens.  That's why they're idiots, yeah.  That's why I was trying to help you out there.  Yeah, I'll end this one.  On this one thing, you're questioning things, right?  Yes.  Ricky booked for Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  It says right on the video, a discussion with Jim Norton on After ONA. 
[00:50:00]  There you go.  There you go.  So why don't we play this clip first, and then we'll play him doing a song.  You can get the song out there.  Eric!  Yeah, I'm looking for it.  Shit.  Okay, here's the...  All right, we've got to break with this from yesterday.  Jimmy and Sam did a great job with Ricky Gervais.  A little taste of the interview.  You're great on Twitter, man.  I love the fact that as famous as you are and as big as your career is,  it's like you don't worry about saying the wrong thing, and you don't... 
[00:50:30]  I love that you...  As long as you're honest, you can't be held accountable, really.  In that Tosh, what's his name?  Daniel Tosh?  Yeah, I didn't know about the joke or anything.  It was raging, and people were asking me,  what do you think about Daniel?  I said, what's happened?  Said, uh, rape joke, rape joke, there's no...  You should never joke about...  I said, well, it depends what the joke is.  No, of course it doesn't, you should never rape...  And then someone sent me a tweet, and she said,  I will laugh at a rape joke the day I know that no one in that audience has been raped.  And I just tweeted back, what a strange door policy. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know that way.  Two, please.  Certainly, that's...  Can I just ask you a question?  Have you been raped?  I have, yeah.  You can't come in.  I'm sorry.  It's a policy, it's not me.  No, because there's a woman at the front, and she's only going to laugh  if she knows that no one in the audience has been raped.  That was a great one, yeah, I remember that very specifically.  But what an ass she is to say that, 
[00:51:30]  because that means you won't laugh at a drunk driving joke,  or you won't laugh at a pedophile joke,  or you won't laugh at any kind of domestic violence reference.  What is a rape joke?  You know, I wouldn't, you know, I'm not, I don't find rape funny.  No, it's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's one of the worst, heinous things that, um,  but there's so many levels to get...  I mean, technically the door policy joke is a rape joke.  Well, if that's a...  Yeah, exactly.  I think.  Yeah, exactly.  Right?  I think so. 
[00:52:00]  I think they mean the subject of rape.  Sure.  As opposed to, you know, again,  if you're laughing at someone who's been raped,  that's not a joke.  Yeah.  That's just, you're a horrible, nasty...  I don't find it funny.  There are some people that would find it funny,  but they're serial killers and rapists.  Right.  Okay?  And the thing is, again, stupid people,  um, treat jokes about bad things  with the same fear and loathing as intelligent people  treat the actual bad thing. 
[00:52:30]  And they're not related.  You know, a joke about a bad...  That's what humour's for.  To get us over bad things.  That's exactly what,  evolutionary speaking,  a humour...  It's how it gets us over bad shit.  If you can't joke about bad shit,  there's no point joking about good shit.  Yeah, because it's already happening.  We don't need it.  We don't need it.  It's already good again.  Everyone likes a balloon.  Who gives a shit?  It's like,  laughter is this drug that cures bad shit.  It's a drug here.  It cures good shit.  I don't want that.  Yeah.  I like this shit. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I want something that cures bad shit.  Well, laughter's the best medicine.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  There's a real self-centredness that comes with it  and a self-importance about  what I feel is appropriate is appropriate  and what you feel is appropriate is not.  And I'm the arbiter of that.  Well, they don't...  They don't...  They don't...  They don't like a comedian  having this superpower of freedom of speech  and exercising it so well.  Right.  They can't stand it.  Yesterday, someone tweeted me,  there is a cure for cancer.  It is called praying.  And I sent back,  your application for chief of oncology 
[00:53:30]  at this hospital has not been successful.  Right?  Sure.  So...  So that's a clear joke  about how stupid it would be  if we took praying as a cure for cancer seriously  as opposed to all that stuff that cures cancer.  Right.  That we've researched, right?  Someone gets involved saying,  oh, so you're laughing at the fact  there's no cure for cancer.  Nope.  I'm laughing at you  because you're a stupid fucking idiot.  Right.  So you don't get what I was saying.  Basically, he's angry on false pretenses. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've had it happen to me.  Someone in the paper has said,  look at this terrible joke  and they've done the joke  and it's wrong.  They've got the joke wrong.  It's so important.  Every aspect of a joke is important.  The syntax, the semantics,  the rhyming,  sometimes even some of the visual aid  that comes with it.  But taken out of context,  the better the joke,  the more fragile it is.  Some people are genuinely angry  and they don't know why  everyone doesn't find the same things  wrong as they do. 
[00:54:30]  Then they just want a retweet.  Then they just don't like you.  Then they just want to say something  because no one listens to them.  Yeah.  Ever.  That's often the case.  An excuse to be heard.  Absolutely.  An excuse to be heard.  They're frustrated that they're not heard  like we are,  that they haven't got that platform.  I did a show,  Madison Square Garden, okay?  So, a lot of people,  I did jokes about race,  the Holocaust,  Anne Frank jokes. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no.  Pedophile jokes, everything.  I got a letter from a society saying,  we loved your show,  we found it there,  we were very disappointed  at the joke about Anne Frank.  And I said,  but you understood the satire  behind the famine joke,  the pedophile joke,  the racist joke,  you understood that  because it wasn't your thing.  Right.  But you can't get over your thing.  You think,  well, why is,  you know,  I'm the same with some things.  I don't like certain jokes 
[00:55:30]  about certain things  because I can't get over them emotionally.  You know,  I don't,  but I've got to keep that quiet.  I've just got to,  you know,  you've got to take the rough  with the smooth,  you know?  And you can understand  on that intellectual level  that if their intent here,  here,  and here was not malicious,  here it probably wasn't malicious either.  Yeah.  You know?  Just because you don't like  that being brought up  doesn't mean that this guy  was trying to hurt your feelings.  No, exactly.  And that's what it feels like.  That's what offense feels like.  Mm-hmm.  Offense feels that 
[00:56:00]  why is he having a go at me?  And you've got to step back from that  and go,  well,  he's not having a go at me.  He doesn't even know you.  Yeah.  Pretty girl on the hood  of a Cadillac, yeah.  She's broken down  on Freeway 9.  I take a look  and get her engine started.  Leave her purring  and I roll on by.  Bye-bye. 
[00:56:30]  Free love on the  free love freeway.  The love is free.  The freeway's long.  I got some hot love  on the hot love highway.  I ain't going home  because my baby's gone.  She's gone.  So, again,  not a comedy song,  but it's a song about Brent  going across America.  He's never been.  In the context  of what it's in  because he's singing this song  like he's this touring musician.  Of course, yeah.  And he couldn't be further from it.  And it's just such a ridiculous fantasy 
[00:57:00]  of, like,  breaking down,  you know,  uh,  yeah.  She's dead.  She's not dead.  Not dead.  Everybody knows  where you go  when the sun  goes down.  Oh,  not this again.  I wasted my time 
[00:57:30]  when I would try,  try,  try.  Cause when the lights  have lost their glow,  you cry,  cry,  cry.  I don't know.  Soon your sugar days  will all be gone.  Johnny Cash.  Cry,  cry,  cry.  You turn me on  to this one,  I think.  You're alone.  You'll call for me,  but I'm gonna tell you  bye,  bye,  bye.  When I turn around  and walk away,  you'll cry,  cry,  cry.  He rocked a song 
[00:58:00]  when he's drunk.  Cry,  cry,  cry,  cry,  cry,  fucking cry baby.  Wow.  Stick your head  in bubble gum.  Where you send it?  United States Navy.  Of course.  58 years ago today,  Johnny Cash,  Cry,  Cry,  Cry.  First single.  It all started with this  for Johnny Cash,  huh?  Oh,  is that what the,  and not so much  with the Johnny Cash,  right?  I have a great deal 
[00:58:30]  of respect for the man,  but as far as really liking  a lot of his music,  no.  Few songs,  very good,  but no,  not a big fan.  You gotta spend some time  with Johnny Cash.  I don't think I do.  Yeah,  I think you might.  Really?  Yeah.  Exhumed him.  Yay!  Good morning,  Jackie.  How are you today?  What?  Great.  You look lovely.  What is going on?  What,  Sam? 
[00:59:00]  He's saying,  you're going yay  when the food comes in.  He's saying,  good morning,  good morning,  Jackie.  What is a little  kumia voice?  Oh,  you don't like  fucking shy Anthony?  Hi.  Anthony kind of  curls it on himself.  Hi,  Jackie.  What,  Sam?  I'm a little tired.  I love cute,  cuddly Anthony.  But I don't understand  Sam's observation here.  I'm a little tired.  I only got like  four hours sleep  because I kind of 
[00:59:30]  did it up a little bit  last night  at the Yankees game  and now I'm happy  that my oatmeal's here.  Yeah,  but whenever any other  intern would walk in,  you'd be,  oh,  who are you?  Or you point  and just point  where they should put it.  No acknowledgement.  Getting annoyed  when they even  come into the room.  Who are you?  That's the truth of the matter  is I would just get annoyed  when they walked in the room.  Right,  and you'd ignore them  because you didn't know  their names.  Now here comes the wiggle.  Wiggle,  wiggle,  wiggle,  wiggle,  wiggle,  wiggle.  We do have 
[01:00:00]  the cutest interns.  I'll put them up  against any interns.  Fucking,  really?  Even against Liam's interns?  Yeah,  Liam gets really good interns.  Fucking Liam.  Really?  I think he goes to  Ford Modeling  and just snatches them  on the way out.  Hey,  you have great tits.  You want to work with me?  Wow,  remember the curly hair,  the curly blonde hair girl?  Was that one of his?  Yes.  All right,  look.  Liam's got something going on.  Yeah,  yeah.  And they don't exactly  hire brainiacs.  Yesterday,  Liam's intern  was waiting with us somewhere  and she said  that she didn't get starstruck, 
[01:00:30]  so don't worry,  but she got a picture  with that guy  from The Office  who she can't remember  his name.  Oh,  really?  Ricky,  the guy who...  That's great.  But Hits won.  Yeah.  I don't know  what they did.  And I know it's a dude  that hires their interns.  Oh,  okay.  They have  an office  full of cute girl interns.  A gaggle?  They have like five of them.  There's no way  there's that much work.  Yeah,  there's tons of them.  I don't see them.  When do they come in? 
[01:01:00]  They come in like  after you guys leave.  I might have to stay late.  Yeah.  I thought the show  ended at 10.  Well,  you know what?  Sometimes we should do  a little more around here.  That's what I'm thinking.  Perhaps I should stay  a little later.  Yeah,  do a little show prep.  I like your attitude.  But I do like  that we've joined the ranks.  It's like Liam's interns  Hits won interns.  Those are always  the cute interns.  Yeah.  Now ONA  has joined those ranks.  Yeah.  The Onion did a funny  little piece  on interns 
[01:01:30]  and how it's like  the story  was based around  the fact that  all interns are  it's like  and it was the headline  like all interns  are cute 22 year olds.  Yeah,  it's pretty fucking funny.  I want to do a  cartoon for the interns.  You know who would do  a really funny cartoon  for the interns?  Doonesbury.  Doonesbury?  Oh,  hilarious.  There'd be two interns  talking.  Yeah,  I'm here to intern  and I'm going to work  and I'm going to work  on getting my 
[01:02:00]  my degree in radio  so I can come here  and get a job  and then the next one  will be the intern  just talking to the  old gruff guy.  He'd be like  coffee please  and then the intern  would go  okay  and that's how  the cartoon would end.  That would be  a terrific cartoon.  That's good.  I miss when you  used to  read the cartoons.  I'll read the funny papers.  Oh God,  I love that.  Read the funny papers.  I never used to get  Doonesbury.  I'd read it  and it'd be like  I was never  a Doonesbury guy.  Stinks.  Did you hear  what the president  did today?  What? 
[01:02:30]  Well,  he raised taxes  on the middle class.  Oh,  that's freaky.  And that would be it.  And I'm like  where was it?  Where's the joke?  I don't get it.  It's fucking terrible.  Where's the twist?  Anything, please.  It was stupid.  Cry, cry, cry.  All right, listen.  Yeah.  Anyway,  Jimmy,  you said you want  to talk about something?  Yes.  A conspiracy thing?  Oh, right.  I have a  I've watched  this Flight 800 documentary 
[01:03:00]  and I know  all the people  on Twitter  are hitting me up  going,  you know,  there's official  explanation.  I know.  I used to do a bit  on the official explanation.  I believed it.  with the fucking  they said the plane  the front of the plane  it was a center fuel tank  explosion  sparked  and then the front  the plane blew off  and what people saw  going up  was the plane  rising  for four more  thousand feet  because the  engine  the engines  weren't affected  because the front  of the plane  flew off.  So people thought 
[01:03:30]  they saw something  rising  was either a reflection  off the water  or something falling  or was the fucking  fuselage rising  for four more thousand feet.  And of course  this is Flight 800  that you know  flew up over  Long Island.  Right.  And I know  eyewitness accounts  can be wrong.  17 years ago  by the way.  I know.  I cannot believe  it's that long.  96.  But I know  eyewitness accounts  can be wrong.  But when I listen  to these people  describing  Who are these people?  Just local witnesses  in Long Island.  Regular folks.  And I listen to them 
[01:04:00]  describing the treatment  they got from the FBI  and what they saw  and the official explanation  and I just  believed what they said.  Yeah.  Sometimes when people  are talking  and then they're like  well the explanation  said  and the guy's like  no I saw it  it came up  from behind the house  and it zigzagged  and it curved  and it hit it.  And there's certain  radar images  that they finally  they had to sue  for everything.  Like this is what  drives you crazy. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Is they had to sue  for every bit of information  like radar information  and all this stuff  under Freedom of Information Act.  Well when the FBI  is doing the investigating  obviously  they're going to  classify a lot of stuff.  For what reason  I don't know  but it's not just  the NTSB  it's the fucking  FBI.  And when you have  something that  they're not sure  if it was terrorism  or not  obviously the FBI  is going to get involved.  So  you know 
[01:05:00]  it's not out of the realm  of reason  that they would  handle an investigation  that way.  But when you see  what they  what was classified  like the speed  at which some of the debris  shot off  there were certain things  that I was like  and again  I know a lot of this  has logical explanations  but the eyewitness accounts  of a lot of different people  that were out that night  that saw something  going up into the air  and  none of them  were called to testify.  There's certain things  that really bothered me  about it 
[01:05:30]  and I just didn't like  the way  I don't know  what the motive  of that would be.  What the motive would be  also you cannot like  the way the investigation  is handled  not like the way  they followed up  with the witnesses  and what not  and that doesn't  necessarily mean  that there's some kind  of sinister  plot happening.  Also the lead up  to it  the fact that  it was on the runway  for a while  you know  all that  that lead up stuff  is it just coincidental  that  that the 
[01:06:00]  the  chances  for an accident  like that  for a fuck up  whatever you want  to call it  corresponded with  a purposeful  downing  or an accidental  downing  of this plane  with a missile?  It could have been  something like  I don't think  it was a big  government conspiracy  to do it  I think it was  either  it was  either somebody  Thank you Sydney  Thank you  She brought me coffee  Sydney  Sid  How do you know 
[01:06:30]  their names?  How did you not?  It might have been  somebody on a  fucking boat  It might have been  a shoulder launch  thing  That to me  is what it is  I don't understand  Why would anyone  take responsibility  for that though?  Because that  especially back then  that was a big  fucking deal  Why would they  come forward  and go  yep we did  this motherfucker  And why would  the government  want to hide  the fact that  That's all stuff  I really  Believe me  I don't  understand that  Yeah if there  was a clear cut  motive  then you could  be like 
[01:07:00]  oh  you know  like 9-11  conspiracy theorists  well  Bush wanted to  get us into  a war  so there was  his opportunity  and that's why  he and the rest  of the government  conspired to  blah blah blah  But this  what's the  endgame  Even maybe not  saying it's a  cover up  I simply don't  agree with their  conclusion  Yeah  Like you know  the only reason  I could see them  but then somebody  raised a great point  why would Boeing  co-sign for that  because they're  liable  Right it makes  them liable  And why would  TWA allow for that  I mean we were 
[01:07:30]  shot down  It ruined them  So there are  people who would  have stood up  and been  extremely vocal  about it  So there are  flaws in it  and holes in it  and that's why  I'm not an adamant  watching this  the eyewitness  accounts are very  hard for me  to write off  because people  are not that  fucking dumb  I know people  are dumb  but a couple  of hundred people  that say they saw  something going up  and then an explosion  is hard for me  to write off  But when you look  eyewitness accounts  are usually the most  unreliable things 
[01:08:00]  in any investigation  It's amazing  They can be  and I account for that  but there was just  so many of them  and I think we all  have a common experience  and we know  what a fucking  everyone said  the same thing  they thought it was  fireworks going up  Yeah yeah  and then they saw  and then they're like  well did you see  the explosion  and then it go up  they're like  no I saw the thing  go up  and it explode  and it's like  they're sharing  an experience  that I think  and that's  the hard part  for me  the physical evidence  look  I'm sure somebody  could spin it  both ways  like as smart as you  are on this side  you got that guy 
[01:08:30]  who was that smart  on that side  Yeah sure  I don't see  a huge motive  for the government  to cover it up  so I have a problem  with that  I'm simply having  a hard time  writing off  and listening  to these people  if it was two people  that saw it  but when it's  this many people  and they're all  again people could  have a mass thing  where they think  they remember things  a certain way  and then they hear  you say it  they go oh yeah  that is what it was  I know that happens too  The thing is also  you're talking about  a major 
[01:09:00]  metropolitan airport  and the surrounding areas  where there's a huge population  Yes  a lot of witnesses  Yes  So if you say  there's hundreds of people  that saw something  a certain way  there's probably thousands  that saw it  just like the government  says it happened  But are there?  I don't know  that's just it  is that covered in here  are they clipping out  the fact that  a lot of people said  that they saw  exactly what  goes with  the official explanation 
[01:09:30]  or are they saying  well there's  this many people  that said this happened  offsets it  by the amount of people  that actually said  it happened the other way  I don't know  and by the way  I've not seen this yet  Jimmy was kind enough  to lend to me  I'm going to see it tonight  It's out next month  on Epyx  and they just sent me a copy  and I just came home  and I had a package  from them  and it was this documentary  It's not out yet  I checked it out  Well you got  the phone's ringing man  Matt's saying  you're missing out  on some info  I very well might be  and again  I'm not fucking  but hold on  there's one more thing  I wanted to hit 
[01:10:00]  before we go to him  and I figured  what it was  Oh shit  All right  now I'll remember  You sure?  Matt in Tampa  What's up Matt?  Tampon  Hey buddy  Hi Matt  To your question  as to why the government  would try to cover this up  there's a book  written several years ago  by an author  by the name of  Jack Cashel  who documented  this entire thing  before the  obviously the documentary  just came out  this was something  that Bill Clinton  who was in the middle  of running  for re-election  he could not have this  now there's some 
[01:10:30]  speculation as to whether  or not it was shot down  by the Navy  or if it was shot down  by the Navy  while they were trying  to get another  smaller plane  that was attempting  to fly  into that flight  remember this was  terrorism in its infancy  and they were just  beginning to realize  that there was a problem  with Islamic terrorism  coming over into this country  that's where  I'm not sure  the documentary  the book  really ever  are able to establish  what shot it down  if it was a terrorist  shoulder fired missile 
[01:11:00]  or something from the Navy  done by accident  but this was not  it was not anything  where it was a mid-tank  fuel explosion  that had been refuted  by many experts  and those eyewitnesses  you're talking about  Jimmy  there were over 200 of them  and if you read  Jack Cashel's book  they document  how the FBI  intimidated  completely ignored  what they said  changed what they said  well I'll tell  just to jump in  for a second  that's  see this documentary  one thing I did like  about it  is it doesn't even  get into  well Clinton  or this and that 
[01:11:30]  it doesn't get into  any of that  it really does stick  mostly with eyewitness  accounts  and then you're  watching these  again and I know  people are boobs  but when you're  watching regular citizens  and they're all  saying the same thing  they're like the FBI  came and I told them  what I'm telling you  and the guy said  no you didn't see that  and I was like  and when enough  people say that  it becomes problematic  for me to ignore it  yeah yeah  that's exactly right  just remember  Bill Clinton  it was eight years  of like having 
[01:12:00]  Al Capone as president  so if you don't think  that he would be  willing to have  something covered up  like that  come on  you guys  but again  I'm a big believer  too in major  major major  conspiracies  it's hard to pull off  because you know  there's just too many  people involved  when you hear the people  that are talking on this  they are  they're former  like you know  the guys from the NTSB  they're not just  a bunch of crackpot teens  who spliced together  news videos  and went  what does that mean  he winked  loose change  it's not that shit  it's not loose changey 
[01:12:30]  no these are  to me these are  much more  legitimate  knowledgeable people  who are  they were investigators  there were people  who were investigators  on this  that have a major  problem with it  and I give them  a tremendous amount  of credit  because they're not  saying that this  whole thing was  orchestrated  they're just criticizing  the way the investigation  and the evidence  was handled  and they were saying  that they had it  color coded  because of where  the pieces fell  and they said  there was a guy  they were noticing  that certain colors  like there was  I think a yellow 
[01:13:00]  a red  and a green say  which shows you  a part of the  Long Island Sound  the ocean that they  fell into  which  it gave you  where the plane part  came from  and they said  that they were  noticing that certain  tags  the colors were changing  and so they installed  a hidden camera  and there was  somebody from the FBI  coming in  and they said  he was changing  they don't know  what he was doing  but they were like  they think he was  changing the color codes  because certain color codes  if something fell here  it was a lot better  than if it fell here  so 
[01:13:30]  oh it would jibe  with the story more  the official story  but again  I know that that's  a lot of people  that get involved  and I have a problem  with  yeah conspiracies  that involve  more than two people  I start having a  but I didn't like  the people that wouldn't  come on camera  and be interviewed  and I just didn't like  the official explanation  you know  I understand  I believed it  when it came out  but when they showed  the CIA animation  like why did the CIA  get involved  this was an NTSB issue  if it wasn't terrorism  why is the CIA involved  I mean  and then the guy 
[01:14:00]  who made the CIA video  wouldn't be  too many people  I understand why  Clinton wouldn't come on  the dumb documentary  but that I get  but there were certain people  who should have come on  and talked about it  that wouldn't  a lot of people agree  that they think  the plane was blown up  Matt thank you  for that call  very good  thank you buddy  we got Mark  in Armont  Mark  hey guys  how you doing  I hope Armont  doesn't get mad  that you're marking him  go ahead Marky  I just wanted to make  the one point  that you were talking  about the center fuel bank  and the short circuit 
[01:14:30]  and why Boeing  would sign off on it  Boeing has so many  military contracts  and they make billions  of dollars off the government  I hate conspiracy theorists  in general  I think they're all assholes  but it just  that's conspiracy  I can almost see  hey go along  with this scenario  maybe it's not  100% there  but you know  you're going to make  5 billion dollars  on the Raptor contract  or the joint strike  or the missile system  billions of dollars  changing hands  between these companies  what dark room 
[01:15:00]  did that conversation  happen in  and how many people  were there  and did they tell  their wives  like that's what  gets me about  conspiracies  is people can't  keep their fucking  mouths shut  I never saw  this documentary  because again  I cringe every time  I think of like  the loose change  documentary  yeah yeah  it's embarrassing  they're so off base  it's insane  but you know  you just think about it  it's like  maybe it's nothing  that sinister  they said at one time  they had warships  in that part of the  ocean  there's that whole theory 
[01:15:30]  that maybe they  accidentally shot down  the plane  or what if it was  let me jump in  for one  what if it was  I thought of this  what if it was  and again  I don't know how  weapons on ships work  I don't know how  that happens  but can one guy  or two guys  get that done  rogue  yeah but I mean  let's say it was  one or two guys  on a military ship  who were just  either fucking  for whatever motive  they had to do it  they did it  I don't think  it's anything sinister  don't get me wrong  I mean let's say 
[01:16:00]  they did the investigation  they think  that you know  it was the center fuel tank  hey let's make  a reasonable conclusion  here you guys  sign off on it  and we'll guarantee  10 billion dollars  in contracts  for the next five years  or if it was  an accidental firing  of a missile  off of one of these ships  I mean they do  battle simulations  all the time  where they're actually  pushing buttons  in these control rooms  who's going to say  they didn't accidentally  fire a missile  because they fired  I think more than one  went up and there was  I believe  and they were saying  that it might have been  a thing that exploded 
[01:16:30]  right by  it really  whatever it was  it makes you feel  so terrible  for those fucking  poor people  that that was a  horrible death  that they experienced  of being in that plane  when the entire  broke off  broke off dude  and fucking  I mean some of them  were killed  they said there was  something about  the randomness  of the  of where people  who should have  been burned  oh right  by their seats  weren't  so they're thinking  like yeah 
[01:17:00]  that the explosion  would have happened  outside the plane  instead of inside  not above the  fuel tanks  where they should  have been  burned  yeah  they said the  randomness of it  like if it was  the center fuel tanks  people in you know  seat 15 D and E  would have all been  burned  and they said  a lot  they weren't  some were  some weren't  it was a really  weird random  Phil and George  George  George  excuse me  hello  hey  last night  I think it was  on O'Reilly  they had that guy  the medical examiner 
[01:17:30]  was it  Botner  oh god  that ghoul  we've had him on  a couple times  he loves that  fucking vampire  he loves death  loves it  he was part of  the investigation  team on that  of course he was  he said that  at the very last  minute there was  a box of corneas  you know for your  eyes that was  put on the plane  at the very last  minute and they  just put it up  in the cockpit  and they thought  maybe that had  something to do  with it at the  time but he  didn't elaborate  on what  wait wait wait  a box of corneas  yeah it was like  medical supplies 
[01:18:00]  I didn't know  it was corneas  they were going  over there  and he said  some of the people  actually drowned  they didn't die  from the explosion  they actually drowned  can you imagine  you survived that  now you're in the  water drowning  but do you think  they were conscious  though or is that  just the final  cause of death  how did the impact  not kill him  falling 13,000 feet  crazy  they didn't address  the medical supplies  in that documentary  though Jimmy  that was my  what would medical  supplies have to do  with anything  they threw it  on the plane  at the last minute  so they're wondering 
[01:18:30]  if that had  something to do  with this  oh you mean  like a bomb  yeah  and they threw  it in the cockpit  is that what  they usually do  yeah  not now  they might have  I don't think  there'd be room  in the cockpit  to throw a box  of medical supplies  in there  but you know what  they're saying  that's exactly  what happened  oh maybe  so maybe it was  a bigger box  because it had  to be cooled  or maybe it was  a big metal box  like you know  you can't just  put corneas  in a shoebox  right  some candy corneas  those you can  fucking eat  until you're  shitting blood  cornea  god damn 
[01:19:00]  do I miss  Halloween  stop eating  candy corneas  your farts  are frightening  the dog  Lamar  don't like  it  shit  Jesus  alright brother  thank you for that  on the  on the heels  of all this  I was watching  Skyjacked  last night  on demand  an old  1972  Chuck Heston  movie  oh  just watching  those old  movies  no CGI  so every 
[01:19:30]  every scene  of the plane  was an actual  707  with just  soot  blowing out  the engines  realize how  remember when  you used to  see a plane  flying  and you'd  look up  and just  see four  distinct  black trails  of smoke  they really  got pretty  good with  getting the  pollution  leveled down  on those  but  funniest part  he's in the  cockpit  they're ready  to take off  and he's  firing up  the old  throttles  but before  he does  he's lighting  a pipe  right in the  cockpit  he lights  his pipe 
[01:20:00]  while he's  on the  runway  right before  take off  he's got  a pipe  in his  mouth  he puts  the throttles  forward  the stewardesses  were all  sexy  they're like  hey honey  the guy  had to open  the door  for the  stewardesses  and he's  like  hey  hey girls  called them  like girls  and sweetie  just harkened  back to a  better time  and then  one of the  one of the  passengers  was pregnant  of course  it's one of  those movies  and she  goes  could I  have a  drink  and 
[01:20:30]  and  the stewardess  like  suggested  you know  what  like  milk  or  something  like  that  she goes  I'll have a  bloody  mary  no kidding  no shit  wow  oh the good  old days  miss it  let's say  hi to Matt  yeah  Matt  what's up  buddy  how you doing  guys  alright  I had a  similar story  to Jimmy  I don't know  if you guys  remember  flight 587  it went down  about two  months after  9-11  yeah  over Queens  of course  off the Dominican  Republic right  yeah  it was going  to the Dominican 
[01:21:00]  Republic  but yeah  right between  me and my  family  like it was  two blocks  from me  two blocks  from my  family  okay yeah  American Airlines  my mother  watched the  whole thing  FBI interviewed  her  she saw a  fireball in  the sky  I've heard  this from  numerous people  FBI was a  guy I went to  high school with  the FBI guy  came interview her  as soon as she  said that he  closed his book  and said alright  thank you very much  and that was  never heard from  well  and that one's  been really  fucking  confirmed  that that was  a fucking 
[01:21:30]  the  horizontal  stable  the vertical  stabilizer  came off  just snapped  off  because the  guy was  working the  fucking  rudder  too hard  I guess  the policy  back then  was if you  got caught  in the jet  wash of  something  and you  couldn't  really  stabilize  your plane  you just  kicked the  rudder over  one side  real hard  and the  whole thing  was made  of carbon  fiber  ripped it  right off  the plane  and once  that's gone  you're  fucking  done  how high  up  were they  they had  just taken  off  so they  weren't 
[01:22:00]  very high  up  they were  out of  stay from  JFK  yeah  yeah  but they  found the  vertical  stabilizer  in the  water  with all  the bolts  just ripped  out  it was very  obvious what  happened to  that plane  and even  then though  you'll see  people like  there was  a fireball  there was  an explosion  this happened  you know  when you  have these  catastrophic  failures  in planes  sometimes  you're  going to  get  something  that looks  like an  explosion  there's  a lot  of  instruments  hydraulic  fluid  friction 
[01:22:30]  there's  a lot  of  reasons  that  something  can  look like  it's  on fire  or exploding  when  really  it's  nothing  that  sinister  well the  documentary  has got  legs  so people  are talking  about it  I liked  it very  much  and again  I wouldn't  I would  want to hear  somebody refute  it point  by point  and maybe  somebody  could do  that  I'm not  married  to it  it was  compelling  because I  know how I  feel about  conspiracy theories  I'm very  doubtful of  them normally  shut up  but these  these were  reputable  people being  interviewed 
[01:23:00]  and they all  knew what  they were  talking about  and that  what's hard  when you hear  I don't care  how  NTSB people  they understand  how an  investigation  should be  conducted  they understand  what evidence  means and  what these  things mean  on a plane  and they  were the  ones talking  in this  documentary  and the  other people  the ones  who were  testifying  before  whatever  weren't  coming on  and talking  and they  did get  one guy  on  who I  think  believed  the  official  explanation  they were  asking why  certain tests  weren't conducted 
[01:23:30]  and he had  really no reason  for it  so again  that could  just be  selective  editing  who knows  but watch it  you though  you believed  you believed in  like a second  gunman theory  for many years  for many years  and then  now you  absolutely  just think  it was  Oswald  so  I mean  your opinions  on these  things can  change  given more  information  when more  information  comes out  that's why  I hate  conspiracy theorists  who are married  to it  because  it's like  to me  you've become  the cause  you'll take  facts and  squeeze them 
[01:24:00]  into what  you want  it to be  buy into  loose change  at first  yes  I did  you know what  not like that  I bought into  the Pentagon  one  made me question  did I buy into  it and think  no  but the Pentagon  one I thought  was interesting  I'm the one  who started  talking about  it on the air  and that's  when you get  all these  conspiracy theories  and then once  you talked to  them you were  like this is  nonsense  these guys  are assholes  and then when  I heard other  people refute  it I'm like  I just believe  that guy  and with the  Kennedy stuff  the more I  read about it  and the more  technology 
[01:24:30]  like when they  could really  zoom in  there's something  called black  dog man  in the JFK  photos  in the grassy  knoll  but there's  some computer  stuff they did  now they said  he would have  been two and a  half feet tall  and I see how  the conspiracy  theorists reach  for stuff  yeah yeah  and I just  that's not the  way I try to  examine stuff  I try to be  logical and  they're just  simply not  logical  and they have  that little  white spill  no you just  don't  alright you lost  me shit dick  that's the part  where their  stories really  come apart  when you get 
[01:25:00]  an explanation  from them  and it's so  outrageous  outrageous  and the  actual  answer  is so  simple  you know  you gotta  default to  the simplest  explanation  sometimes  and they never  say oh yeah  that's true  never  do these guys  say that  because their  agenda  is a conspiracy  and that's what  drives me  because my  agenda is not  if someone had  a really great  answer for all  these  here's exactly  what that was  I would at  least listen 
[01:25:30]  to it  open minded  you got  questions  I have  questions  you know  who else  has questions  no I don't  oh I see  let's go to  John in  AR  John in AR  what's up  buddy  hey good  morning guys  what's going on  I don't know  the flight number  right now  I just heard  you guys  talking about  the one  that went  down  after 9-11  over New York  yes  I'm kind  of a conspiracy  guy a little bit  not too much  but I've heard  the one  and it sounds  kind of plausible  that the one 
[01:26:00]  that blew up  was technically  they were saying  it was the first  shoe bomber  I thought of that  too yeah maybe  the second bomber  so I don't know  if you guys  heard that  and what you  thought about that  so  that was what  I thought  when they  said a fireball  I'm like I  wonder looking  back on it  after Richard  Reed was  arrested  on that flight  from Paris  I'm like I  wonder if that  was a shoe  bomber  like did that  do it  and they just  who the fuck  know maybe  800 was a  when you look  at like the  flight data  recorders and  stuff not even  just the voice  recorders  you know it  shows the 
[01:26:30]  position of  all those  instruments  and if there's  a plane  and he's  flying into  a jet wash  which he  did and  he's trying  to correct  and all  that's going  on and  coincidentally  enough it's  at the same  time some  guy wants to  blow the  plane up  you gotta  take all  the facts  and put them  together  you can't  take the  facts and  try to mash  them into  what you want  it to be  so I  mean that's  a prime  example of  how some  conspiracy  theories can  just be  ridiculous  but yeah but I  don't believe the  whole fucking jet 
[01:27:00]  wash thing  why'd they just  do that on the  ground  by the way  Vicodin in  full effect  wow really  holy fuck am I  hammered  it didn't affect  me last night  this much  what are you  feeling  I'm like  ooh  nice  like it's  good  fucking nice  buzz  Anthony though  you don't  really know  no you're  tough to figure  out  you don't  really know  you know how 
[01:27:30]  you know when  we fucking flip  on certain  websites and he  goes ah that's  racist man  why can't we  all just live  together  loaded  right  let's do the  test after the  break  let's go to a  few websites and  see how hammered  you really are  I feel a really  really good buzz  right now  yeah  it's like all  of a sudden  all of a sudden  I turned my  head and it  went like  how are you  going to drive  home  you can't drive  home like  that  yeah I can  no you can't  no you can't  I'm fine  can we play the 
[01:28:00]  hot dog lady  that could be an  opening Anthony  nugget on the  podcast down the  road  I was listening to  that porn  the porn that  the nugget  the old porn  bit the  fucking  8-track  porn  god  that's not  a nugget  that's a  whole  fucking  bit  get the  fucking  podcast  that is a  funny  fucking bit  a lot of  people saying  the 8-track  porn  bit is  hilarious  it's on the  latest  opening Anthony  podcast  go get it  now please  Patrice O'Neill  in studio for  that one  well for one of 
[01:28:30]  them  she get ice cream  sandwiches for  breakfast  getting all  fucked up  eating ice cream  sandwiches  I had three  bites yesterday  and threw it  out and you  know what  gotta go see  the trainer  again today  ah  oh  I start  rehab on my  shoulder  today  oh what'd  they say  when you  went yesterday  I got an  MRI and now  I just wait  oh yeah  the doctor  already thinks  it's a torn  bicep and a  torn rotator cuff  what do you  gotta do  for fucking  six months  what  what is  rehab entailing  you know  what I wish  you'd ask that  question years  ago  that's a great 
[01:29:00]  question because  the doctor also  he's one of the  best in the city  he's a sports  guy  he works on  like  he works on  athletes  like guys  that you  know  and that's  what I'm  confused by  because I'm  like oh  that means  surgery  which I was  scared of  because no  I don't  think so  at all  I think  we could  handle this  with rehab  and all  sorts of  shit  so hopefully  you'd assume  doing nothing  with it would  be the best  thing  right  just leave  it alone  I don't  I really  don't  understand  what you  know  physical  rehab  is going  to do 
[01:29:30]  to you  know  help a  torn  bicep  muscle  I mean  obviously  it's a slight  tear  how did  you do  it  I don't  know  where  and tear  hauling  that giant  cock out  showing it  off  hauling it  out  hauling it  out  why don't  you pull  your big  prick  out  stick it  in my  shitter  honey  mine  plops out  like that  snake did  after it  opened the  door  that'd be  great if  you could  open a  door like  that  yeah  that's how  he throws  this big 
[01:30:00]  cock on the  back of the  door handle  and it slowly  opens  and you talk  to your  cock  good boy  that a  boy  I don't  know  they get  like deep  massage  and that  gets the  blood flow  going  and that  helps heal  it  and I  don't  and then  like shoulder  exercises  but I had  a fucked up  right shoulder  five years  ago  and this  thing is  fine man  this left  one is way  worse  if you had  a choice  between  rehabbing  it for  a year  or having  a surgery  where in  two months  it's done  what do 
[01:30:30]  you do  surgery  scares me  always  yeah  yeah  you never  want to  opt for  they put  me out  when they  fucking put  the pipe  down my  throat  oh  that  sounds great  it doesn't  sound good  when I was  dealing with  some acid reflux  which just  magically went  away by the way  I'm totally  fine on that  front  but I got  everything  checked out  and when they  give you that  propofol and you  realize oh my  god there is no  afterlife  that's a real  bummer  oh shit  because why  wouldn't your  brain still  be kind of  somewhere in  there  right 
[01:31:00]  they could  kill you  within seconds  technically  and then you  wake up a half  hour later  and you have  no concept  of what  happened  that makes  you question  what the  fuck  happens to  you when  you die  doesn't  it  are you  trying to  freak  my buzz  out  you're a  real bummer  explain that  one  don't be a  bummer  explain  propofol  see this  guy had  six  rotator  surgeries 
[01:31:30]  no  he's just  spinning in  circles  it's gonna  be a long  day  yes  I'm tired  from yesterday  ants on  vicodin and  Jimmy's silly  this is gonna  be great  because before  the show  the food  came and  I know  you guys  were saying  well when  is it  anti-social  tickets  and I  didn't  want to  talk  about it  but I'm  like come  on  today  Friday  10 o'clock  the final  show goes  on sale  myself  Amy  Artie  and  Dave  Attell  Saturday 
[01:32:00]  July 20th  in the  Sands Casino  in Bethlehem  PA  10 a.m  today  our tickets  go on  sale  for that  second show  go see  them  they're all  very funny  Amy's on  fire  yeah she's  great  that show's  great  one more  call about  the documentary  you saw  Brian's a little  frustrated that  you're missing  out on some  details  okay Brian  Brian in  Illinois  what's up  hey guys  I was also  fortunate enough  to get the  screener of the  rough cut of  TWA 800 from  epics  it is phenomenal 
[01:32:30]  you're absolutely  right  I think one  area of your  argument that  you're leaving  out in talking  to the guys  is that it's  the lead  investigator from  the NTSB  and the lead  investigator from  TWA who are the  whistleblowers  featured in this  documentary  oh I didn't  know the TWA  guy was  okay  and Jimmy  I don't know  if you remember  the part where  the bald gentleman  who looks like  he's right out  of poltergeist  is talking  yes  I've never  I could have  had the volume  on mute  and know that  he was lying  just from his  body language  yeah I didn't 
[01:33:00]  I had trouble  believing him  excuse me  and I also  have  I did give  credibility  to the guys  that were  involved in this  because they  were directly  involved  they were  handling the  evidence  you could look  at it another  way though  and think  that  you got  the head  of the NTSB  and the head  of TWA  if they felt  like their toes  were being  stepped on  by the feds  coming in  on this  investigation  of course  they're going  to be all  sour grapes  about it  and perhaps  have a  different opinion  than they came 
[01:33:30]  up with saying  we could have  done a better  job if these  guys weren't  in there  so there could  be some animosity  there right  and to your  point  the NTSB  guys make a  point of saying  that it's the  first time  that they've  ever rolled  up on an  investigation  rolled up  on a crash  scene  and it was  locked down  they said  it was like  martial law  the way the  FBI had the  and that's a  quote from the  movie  it's not like  a Boston thing  it was martial  law the way  that they had  the scene  tied down  I guess because  they assumed  it was terrorism  too  I mean that 
[01:34:00]  you know  that's a lot  of fucking  people  it's a big  plane  a major  airline  I get why  the FBI  was involved  I understand  why they did  there could be  some animosity  between the  agencies  because they  felt like  they were  being left  out of the  mix  so the fact  that they're  the head  of the  NTSB  and the  head of  TWA  almost helps  to refute  the conspiracy  the head  of the  investigation  for  the  NTSB  and the  head  of the  investigation  for  TWA  obviously  not the  CEO  but  right 
[01:34:30]  yeah  I hear you  and that's  a good point  by Ant  that could be  why they  like you said  there was just  too many  there's enough  legit people  where you go  like  these are all  people  I'm psyched  to say it  they all  understand  this stuff  in a way  that we  don't  and they're  all people  who've  examined  crash sites  before  and like  they're not  pulling crazy  theories out  like they  understand  how many  what  like the  one  I think  there's a  point  when again  this could  be selective  editing  where they  have never  conclusively  proven that 
[01:35:00]  it was a  center fuel  tank explosion  like that  that's what  they've come  to  but they  there is  no smoking  gun  with that  and they  can't  say  what exactly  sometimes  that happens  too  I mean  you could  go with  your best  assumption  of what  happened  without  having  100%  confirmation  Jackie  how you  doing  TGIF  right  Jackie  how good  do these  look  these little  blueberries  oh and just  the yogurt  I asked for  very good  look at her  right back  to work  she's a  she's a  dream 
[01:35:30]  hold on  sir  we're  encouraging  the intern  you gotta  give positive  encouragement  to help  them  I've been  here for  eight years  who are you  yeah what's  your name  maybe that's  why  I can't  believe what  I'm seeing  rosacea  and an  afro  who would  want to  talk to you  all right  thank you  Brian  one thing  that  bombs  I'm kidding  Brian  is that 
[01:36:00]  48 hours  after  200  was the  opening  ceremonies  of the  1996  Atlanta  Olympics  that might  tell you  why you  wouldn't  want it  to be  terrorism  that could  be a  possible  yeah  you know  I didn't  realize that  that could  be a  possible  motive  but as  the only  problem  I would  have  with that  and that's  a great  point  but it  took  it was a  four-year  investigation  I mean  it really  was a  thorough  investigation  amazing  how much  of that  plane  they got 
[01:36:30]  up from  the bottom  of the  ocean  yeah  fucked up  one of  the guys  said he  was watching  video  and this  was hard  again  an NTSB  guy  or whatever  he was  watching  the video  or the  underwater  footage  and he  said he  noticed  that the  time codes  had jumped  oh really  and uh  he said  I'm watching  an edited  video  and I  told the  guy from  the FBI  I want  to see  the  unedited  video  and he  said  no  wow  I know  that sounds  very ominous  but these  are people  who should  have access  to that  I would  think  uh-huh  I get  if that 
[01:37:00]  was a  regular  guy  like you  know  I went  into the  archives  and I  go  shut up  that was  a guy  actively  involved  with the  watch it  and tell  me  I'd be  interested  to hear  what you  think  yeah I  can't wait  to see  if you  agree  with me  if you  won't  I  wouldn't  really  be  interested  to hear  oh  I  first dropped  acid when I  was 18  I was over  at these  people's house  one night  this guy I  went to school  with was over  there and asked  me if I wanted  to try some 
[01:37:30]  acid  I had read  about it in  the newspapers  and heard a few  friends talk about  it so I was  curious  I was pretty  jacked up on  marijuana so I  decided to try it  and I dropped it  I don't know what I  was waiting for a  flash or a rush or  whatever but I kept  sitting there waiting  and waiting and  nothing was happening  so I got up and then  went to the dresser  and put on a pair of  pink capris and a  green and brown blouse  I thought the colors  were beautiful  so we tripped down to 
[01:38:00]  Market Street and I  decided to buy a hot dog  I was very hungry  and I had put mustard  and ketchup and relish  in the usual and I put  the hot dog up to my  mouth and somebody  started screaming  I didn't know what was 
[01:38:30]  happening so I looked up  at my friend Terry and  said did you hear that  didn't you hear someone  scream he said no I got  the hot dog up to my  mouth again and I was  ready to bite and the  scream got louder and it  hit me no it couldn't be  and I looked down at the  hot dog and there was a  face on him  eyes nose a mouth I had put 
[01:39:00]  the ketchup to where it  looked like his hair and he  started telling me that I  couldn't eat him he had a  wife and seven kids at home  to support and I stood there  with his hot dog and asked  Terry do you know this hot  dog is talking to me and he  says no let's get out of  here he thought I was just  baking and I told him look at  the thing he's got a face  and he's screaming and the  guy finally looked over and  he got on the same trip that  I was on and we sat there 
[01:39:30]  carrying on a conversation  with that hot dog finally I  decided I was just  hallucinating so I put it in  my mouth and bit down  it screamed so loud that you  could hear it all over town  so I had to throw it on the  ground and step on it and I  was jumping on this hot dog in  the middle of Market Street I  realized that I had murdered it and I took off screaming down the street and I took off screaming down the street and I was 
[01:40:00]  scared scared  the O.B. and Anthony show  all right it's Friday 
[01:40:30]  Really like that Sam was just laughing like a little girl because he was listening in on me and Ant's conversation during the break  Oh my god. This is some inside radio shit. Yes, it is. Don't get to be a part of us. It's not true. It's not gonna make us look good

No, it didn't work well for my stupid phone  It was made for the iPhone, right? 
[01:45:30]  Worked fine for the iPhone  Yeah  Yeah, now, though, Instagram  I mean, you know  Why have more apps than you need?  How many apps do you really use?  Percentage-wise  How many apps on your phone  Do you actually use  Compared to how many you have?  For me, it's gotta be  Probably 5%  If that  Oh, easy  All the rest are just there  For me to flip through  To try to find the ones I use  I just uninstall now  Do you?  Yeah, I just uninstall  To clean it up a little bit  Can you do that from your phone  Or do you gotta do it from the computer?  Oh, I can do it from my phone  Oh, you can do it from your phone 
[01:46:00]  You can do it from your phone  But then if you  Doesn't it  Put it back on  Yeah, it puts it back on  If you do something  How do you take it off your phone?  Oh, I don't know  You just gotta uninstall  It's easy  You gotta touch your icon  And hold it down  Right  And then you'll get X's near  Right  And they all kind of wobble  And they wobble  They go  Yeah, but how do you get rid of it?  You hit the X  And it goes away  It says delete  And you say yes  And then you're done  Where have you been, Jimmy?  Jimmy, how hard are you?  Not just the icon  You gotta uninstall the whole fucking thing  It's done  No, but that's the whole thing  It's not like a computer program 
[01:46:30]  Look, watch this, Jimmy  Watch this, Jimmy  Watch this, Jimmy  You hold it down  And they all go like that  And then you hit the X  And it'll disappear  I can't fit  Is that...  Oh, Jimmy  It gets rid of the whole app  Not just the icon  Yeah, the whole app  That's not how it works  On the fucking Samsung Galaxy S3  What do you gotta do?  Soon to be the S4  I'm really thinking of getting one still  I want to make the leap  I'm gonna keep my iPhone  But I have two phones still  You do  My pal Buzzy has the Note  It's not that big  Stop, it's a little bigger 
[01:47:00]  It's not that big  It's getting to the point now  Where it's like  I even tried it  I tried putting it in all my pockets  I was like, you know what?  I can handle this  What kind of pockets you're sporting?  Big ones  Giant cargo pants pockets  Big fucking pockets  Is that a Samsung in your pocket?  That's right  Yeah, motherfucker  The Legend seats?  Yeah  $1,400  Gotcha  The cheapest one is $700  That's one ticket  I believe so  Nice  You getting charged?  Or it's celebrity discount?  We know this ticket lady 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  It makes Sam laugh  I don't know why  But she's like a fan of the show  It kind of puts her in this thing  Where all she is is a ticket lady  Well, she kind of is  Yeah, I wouldn't want to be called a ticket lady  You're fucking it up again  No, and I'll tell you why  She kind of is  She's a whore  I'm putting it on  Jesus  I'm putting it on her this time  And I'll tell you why  Because I didn't want her  Just to be the ticket lady anymore  I said, look  There's three  There's three tickets  Obviously, you know  You do things in pairs  So why don't you be our fourth  Why don't you sit down all nice  And we'll socialize  And we'll have some nice food  And then you take in 
[01:48:00]  A little of the game  Even though you get to go  To whatever game you want  And we'll socialize a little bit  She's like, nah, I've got work to do  And I've got to get home  So now she's the ticket lady  Does that sound like that?  Now he's doing a voice  No, I'm pretty good at voices  That's a horrible  Obscure ones  I mean, that was a good one  That's a very good person  Enjoy the bleachers, Hopi  That's who you're going to be  But I wanted her to be more than the ticket lady  She is more than the ticket lady  She's not  Because she blew off my invitation  To join us  She's a human being  She's got a feeling 
[01:48:30]  You guys go enjoy  She's got a life and a soul  Hey man, I can't wait to see the Grand Canyon guy  You think he's going to fall  More than a woman to me?  Okay  You know, it's funny  I wouldn't know what the heck to do with a parachute  Because that's one thing  I've trained my whole life  To stay up in the sky  Not to come out of the sky  So I've never skydived  I've never base jumped  Never even trained for that  The only thing that I can relate to that  Is I bungee jumped  From about 230 feet once  And the entire time  I was just visualizing  What my great-grandfather was going through  When he fell off the wire  And lost his life  So I was like, never again 
[01:49:00]  That's why we should point out  I mean, you have lost family members  Carl Orlando, your great-grandfather  You also have an uncle who's paralyzed  But he's done, don't you?  He's done  That's right  He's screaming and pointing to the ear  You know, everything I do  I do to pay tribute to my great-grandfather  And there's a lot of reasons why he did  Ah, that's boring  I mean, how do you practice with something like that?  Yeah  I don't know  I guess just practice three feet off the ground  Yeah, but there's a big deal  We'll go higher and higher  Are there fucking things you can do with your life  And walk across a hole?  But there's a difference  Like three feet off the ground  We talk about that 
[01:49:30]  I know  It's like if you took a sidewalk  And it's just on the side of the road  And someone bet you a million dollars  That you couldn't walk on that sidewalk  And stay on it  It's easy  You can do it every day  But put that over the Grand Canyon  You'd be  You'd be crawling  You'd be out of your mind  And feeling like  You know, at any moment  So how do you practice three feet up  And then you put it over the Grand Canyon?  How about a bicycle?  Oh, that would be really scary  You could bicycle down a sidewalk  Like it's nothing  You don't even think about it  You could even get right to the edge 
[01:50:00]  And not go off onto the grass  But now do it across the Grand Canyon  Fuck  How about you do it?  No, I ain't doing it  Right, Rob?  That guy who did the  Niagara Falls  And he got pissed  Oh, you're racist  Yeah  Oh, Niagara  Sorry  If I get an ant  Maybe trouble  You joined a tired show today, Rob  Well, we were pissed by that guy  Because ABC is making it sound like  Oh my God  Something crazy can happen  You're like  No, nothing can happen to the guy 
[01:50:30]  He might hang there awkwardly  As they find out  You know, get the helicopter  Wally, Phil  He must be so embarrassed  Looking like that  You don't want to see these guys succeed  You want to see them fall  Yeah, it's terrible  By the way, the Grand Canyon walk  Yeah  He picked a very short walk  Well, it is, yeah  I've been to the Grand Canyon  I was thinking he was going to go over the fucking  The wide area  Like the one that's miles wide  Yes  He's got to walk miles  That looks like it might be 100 yards  Technically, it's over the Grand Canyon 
[01:51:00]  Technically  Oh, it's just the angle  It's really much longer  Is it?  Is he doing it now?  Oh, boy  No, he's not doing it now  When's he doing it?  Primetime  This weekend  I'm not sure if it's Saturday or Sunday  That's right  It's synonymous now  Yeah  That's right  You branded yourself  No safety harness, though  He's going  Fucking  No  You made him wear it last time  Look, pussies  Well, this is going to be on the Discovery Channel  They don't play  They're like, fuck this  No safety fucking harness  So what's going on with this bus tour now? 
[01:51:30]  Bus tour?  All systems go  Because last time you guys were involved with a bus  There were issues  Weren't there?  A few  I seem to remember somebody who spent a little time in Starr  Oh, yeah  It's Starr  It's Starr  I love that old lingo  You know, cigarettes  He was a trooper, man  Yeah  Check one for the team  What's his name?  Is Warner Wolf a nice guy?  Warner Wolf is one of the nicest guys in the fire  Okay, can I see him every day?  We see him in the gym  And he never says, like, I've seen him  And I've met him before  And I've done 
[01:52:00]  I missed his show once  And I've never  Maybe he just doesn't remember me  But I'm afraid to say hi to him  Because he doesn't seem happy  No, he's a very  He's like a weird dude  In that he doesn't like to touch people  He's one of the germaphobe kind of guys  Oh, good  Warner  There you are  Sweaty Jimmy gone  So  That explains his little Jewish sandwich and soda  He brings to the gym every day  He brings to half a Jew  I said Jew sandwich  What makes a Jewish sandwich?  Two Jewish people between bread  Fucking delicious  You'll know it when you see it 
[01:52:30]  The Jewish guy with his sandwich  It's like the old man packing lunch  Yeah, but he brings his own lunch to the gym  He's not Jewish, is he?  No  I don't know  Yeah, he is  His wife's not  Okay  Yeah  But he's one of those guys  That got bar mitzvah late in life  Like when he was an adult  Oh, really?  No  He's a great guy  Okay, I'm happy to hear that  Because I'll say hi to him now  Yeah  We see him every day  But he's just scared  He's not a person  He's just scared  No, but I just want to bother him  He's one of the reasons I got into this shit  Really?  Yeah, man  Warner Wolf was great when we were growing up  Holy fuck  And now he's on Imus' show 
[01:53:00]  He's a funny motherfucker too  But you guys  Yeah?  Really?  Does he tell racist jokes?  No, no  But he's got a very skewed view of the world  The way he approaches  Of black  No, Jesus  Come on  Unbelievable  That's Tony Powell  Great  I like Tony, man  I know Tony for years  Yeah, yeah  From stand-up  Yeah  We did a gig  Upstate  It was in Cooperstown  It was an outdoor thing

Annoying  Specific

[02:07:30]  Yeah  And then you come around the corner to Fox  And you know  They're really close to each other  It's like background music  Yeah  Any money a couple weeks ago  He was alright  He was one of the better ones  Right  But it was in the pouring fucking rain  Yes  And then they had the barbecue guy  What's his name  Giving out free barbecue  Yeah  Free barbecue  In the rain  In the rain  There were like two people  I think it was the roadies  They wanted him to stand up  He was actually killing  Any money saying  Two tickets to paradise  He had one left over  That's how small the crowd was  Jesus  I like the fact that he knew 
[02:08:00]  That was even too clever  Even for Chip  Yes  Yes  He had to invent a new character  Chip wasn't allowed to have that one  Jimmy says something  You're like  Why didn't he put that in the Chip voice  Right  I think it was just a bomb  Yeah  Oh there's plenty of those  Just the disturbing nature  That Chip's capable of going Jubilee  When you say cherry  Yeah  That he would even go there  Right  And with a lot of gusto too  He's very confident in his jokes  Chip  Yeah  Hey what are you guys talking about this morning  Any controversy  Well 
[02:08:30]  Well Anton Vicodin  I went to a Yankees game  Fucking Vicodin  It's a tired show right now  I'm not even joking  I'm really high right now  Because he has a problem  Yeah  I had a tooth pulled  You want some donuts  I had a wisdom tooth pulled  Oh  They say those are those painful ones  Well  And they gave me some Vicodin  For the pain  For the day you got it pulled yesterday  But I did  I typed  Exactly  No  First thing I do is pour them in my hand  And I go  One, two, three

[02:09:30]  And then like 20 minutes after I took it  Everyone's words started to sound a little weird  And I had phones  And I was very conscious of my hands  Like they became very like  Like wow look at me  My hands  Jesus Christ  Vicodin doesn't do that to you  There could be a universe  Under that fingernail  No it doesn't  They probably lace it with like THC or something  Not that I'm 100 years old  To say that  I'm very sensitive to drugs  Because people are like  Oh it's only to  And then yeah  I put a picture of which Vicodin I had  On Twitter  And of course  That's the fucking weakest one

[02:12:00]  If you didn't want to go face to face  You went CB  And yeah  Right  That fucking Dreamweaver girl  How do you call yourself Dreamweaver?

[02:20:30]  It's a film called Redemption  Redemption  Yeah  It was called Hummingbird in the UK  But they renamed it  Yeah, good idea  Yeah  Good thing  They renamed it because they thought  Hummingbird was a little bit twee  Yeah  What was the motive for Hummingbird?  What does it mean?  Hummingbird is a generic term for a military drone  That basically, the story's about an ex-soldier that is basically, one of these drones pays witness 
[02:21:00]  To something bad that he does  And basically, his conscience gets the better of him  And he can't live with himself  And he takes to the streets and starts living as a homeless person  So the Hummingbird is, you know  Is quite an appropriate sort of title for the film  Yeah, but the redemption part kind of makes more sense, yeah  Well, it's a little easier  It's a little easier to put on people  They'll be like, alright, it's redemption  Hummingbird, they're like, what?  Yeah, try to get a bunch of guys to go see Hummingbird  If they don't know what it's about  I want to go, let's go see Hummingbird 
[02:21:30]  Sounds good  Get the money back  So it's just, it's an action film  Well, yeah  I mean, it's  The good thing about it  It's not driven by the action  It's written by a very, very smart writer  That's written a couple of great films  Eastern Promises, I don't know if you saw  Oh, yeah  That was great  That was good  Fucking brutal, that movie  Yeah, so there was a movie before that called Dirty Pretty Things  And these are tales around the city of London 
[02:22:00]  Which are, you know, thrillers based in London  This is the third part of, you know, an unrelated story  But by Stephen Knight, it was the writer  This is his first attempt as a director  And he, you know, he's brilliant  He really nailed it  First attempt?  Yeah  So, do you look at that and be like  Are you like, oh boy  I hope he knows what he's doing  Of course you do, yeah  Yeah  But you know pretty quickly  If someone knows what they're doing  By the way, they sort of  And if they have a good support staff around them too 
[02:22:30]  I mean, he really did put  The best group of people around him  Yeah  A good deep  It helps  You know what?  I am convinced  You could know nothing about directing a movie  And if you put the right people around you  You can be a brilliant director  Absolutely  That is absolutely  But that's the key to anything  You can find yourself with people better than you  Yes  You guys know about that  Well  Yeah, yeah  That's  So, some gunplay in this one? 
[02:23:00]  Not a lot  Not a lot of gunplay?  Nothing really  He just  He starts working for a  For a group of people  He starts off, you know  Washing dishes  Basically he starts to rehabilitate himself  He's a homeless chap on the streets  And he starts to rehabilitate himself  He gets off the booze  Gets off the drugs  And starts to, you know  Wash dishes for  In Chinatown  And then all of a sudden  He starts working for  For this Chinese boss  And starts, you know 
[02:23:30]  Throwing a bit of muscle around  And earning some money  Basically to  To keep his daughter  To put away for his daughter  It's a strange daughter  That he doesn't see anymore  Good hearted guy  Yeah, good hearted guy  And that's the start of  The, you know  A change for the good  But then he finds out  That he, you know  When he's sober  That he's a bit of a  He's a bit of a nuisance  And he  He starts to, you know  He has to sort of  Throw himself to the wayside again  Because  Right  It becomes too dangerous  How does the movie end 
[02:24:00]  I can tell you're really  Fucking interested  You know  We're going to get  Somebody like that  One day  Somebody's going to slip  And just get away  We try that every time  How does it end  Right  I should have come up  With a different movie  Shouldn't I  So it's  It's a musical  It should have been  It's not a musical  No  Your films have grossed  Over a fucking  Billion dollars  Your films have grossed  Over a billion dollars  I didn't see much

[02:25:30]  With the reaction  The first two got  That people kind of  Want to get on board  That one  It's fun  They're fun movies  To watch  They're great  You just  You know  Give us the gun  And it's  Yeah  Yeah  You can  You know  Eject the mind  For a small moment  Yeah  I know  I love people  That watch that  And go  You can't do that  Exactly  Doesn't make sense  Look at how he's driving  That thing  You can't drive  Like  Yeah  Don't worry about it  Sit back and enjoy it  What was your favorite film 
[02:26:00]  You ever made  That's a great question  You know  I think  The movies I did  For Guy Ritchie  Would you know  Snatch  And Lockstone  You know  Because they were  They were a long time ago  And they sort of  Gave me a job  They gave me a career  Snatch is still great  It's one of those movies  You just can watch  A million fucking times  Do you really eat  Spinach and rice  No  Oh  Once again  Reports say 
[02:26:30]  He keeps in shape  On set  By eating  A diet of  Spinach and rice  Where does that come from  What turd said that  I don't know  He probably ate it once  Because there was  Nothing else left  Or something  And then that becomes  The thing  There's so much  Stupid crap  That gets written  About this  What's the stupidest thing  You've  Probably that  Oh wow  Alright  We made Wikipedia  Nice  Love it  Exactly  That's a dumb thing  To have written about you  I know 
[02:27:00]  But I just  Ask it like  It's a fucking  Really Barbara Walters  Moment  Spinach and rice  Hopefully he cries  I really am an asshole  But yeah  You can't  You just pull  These questions  Off Wikipedia  And you're like  Okay  That's what the  We don't do  Pre-interviews  Obviously  But again  Why would I ask that  Here's what he could have said  Yes I do  And now where  You're going  You want to think  How these things  Are going  A white dust  Down a fucking alley  Brown or white rice 
[02:27:30]  Yeah  It would have to be brown  Which rice is that  I would have used it  The same way  Basmati rice it is  I would have just turned around  And said  You know  Because I've been eating  Some spinach  And everyone  Who gives a shit  And then somebody else  Would have picked up  Happy birthday Jimmy  Yeah  Exactly  That was fucking terrible  So what do you eat  On saturation  What do I eat  Whatever the catering has  You know  The film sets are good  They have a 
[02:28:00]  You know  They've got people  That cook you  Whatever you want  So whatever you fancy  Do you have to  Really concentrate  On what you're eating  Like make sure  You're eating well  Don't eat these every day  Right  Right  You try and be smart  If you're trying to train  And you know  You're trying to look good  Then there's a certain thing  That you've got to put  In your mouth  So it's  Do you have  Like a movie physique  And like hanging around  Eating a little shittier physique 
[02:28:30]  Of course  Do you get in shape  For the movies yeah  You know how to get in shape  If you want to get in shape  And then you know how to  Abuse yourself  When you want to abuse yourself  So it's easy  Yes  I only know the abuse  In transition  Ron's in transition  Earmuffs Ron  You're probably right in between  Earmuffs  You don't have to listen to this  Some of the movies  You're in obviously  Pretty physically exerting  I mean I know  There are stuntmen  And stuff  But just the running around  You've done 
[02:29:00]  Especially a movie  Like Crank  Well you do your own stunts  Don't you  I mean  Yeah  I do that  I do anything that's  You know  I won't do stupid things  Like dive out of a burning building  I mean there's just no point  And the pyrotechnic crap  Is just  It's frightening  You can't calculate  You know  How far the explosion  Is going to go  And you know  It's a stupid way to die  Right  Your next movie  Well  A stupid way to die  It's a good one 
[02:29:30]  It's almost as good as Hummingbird  Originally called  Nursing Blueberries  Radar  I'm sure earlier on  They probably asked you  To do more stunts  Than they do now  You're probably a little more  Of a commodity now  I would  No that's  Absolutely true  You know  You have to get  You have to sign a waiver  If you want to get out of a car  Are you sure you can do this  Do you want to put a harness on 
[02:30:00]  Bring the crash mat  And he's getting out of the bus  Yeah  I mean it's a fucking joke  It is  Yeah yeah  They get so protected  Because  You know  They want to finish the film  And they spend a lot of money  And  Are there limitations  On what they let you do  Contractually  During a filming  Like  You can't go skiing  Like  A lot of times  They put restrictions  On guys  Yeah you sign a thing  You can't  You can't go skiing  You can't do  You can't race a car  You can't  Wow  There's a big long list  Of things  And you sign at the 
[02:30:30]  Bottom of the page  And you say  Listen I'm not going to  Do any of that stuff  Yeah no sex with Amanda Bynes  Things like that  Very dangerous  So  When I did  I did crank  Years ago  And there was a  There was a stunt  Where I have to  Have a fight  Outside of the helicopter  And I'm standing on the skis  And we're having this punch up  And you know  I'm actually outside the helicopter  And I've got the hip pick  And  That  They shot  On the last day of filming  Just in case 
[02:31:00]  Smart scheduling  Just in case  We could get away  Without this scene  If need be  Wow  Hey look at me falls  We just roll credits  Holy fuck  It was literally that way  Because they couldn't  They couldn't get insurance  For that  And they said  No way  Oh they can't  No  You want to do it  You've got to do it  On the fucking last day  And how scared were you  Outside that helicopter  Be honest  That's gotta be  Yeah it was  It was a  Yeah it was  But you know 
[02:31:30]  The adrenaline is  Sure  That helps you  Get through it right  Well yeah  It's scary  But you know  It feels good  When you've done it  Because Tom Cruise  Once it's over  I bet  Yeah you're like  Fuck that kicked ass  Yeah yeah  Yeah  Tom Cruise did his own  Stunch for Mission Impossible  Three or four  Whatever  And I've become obsessed  With that  That Burge Tower  The Burge Tower  Yeah  But I'm like  How did he get  A movie company  I don't care how much  Waivers you sign  How did Tom Cruise  Get them to sign off  On him  Jumping at 1100 feet  And running down the side  Because he probably said  I'm not going to do  Your fucking movie  Unless you let me do this 
[02:32:00]  What kind of insurance  Because he loves that shit  It's you know  It's a surprise  Because you know  His biggest movie star  In the world  How do you  How do you let him  Do something  That may or may  He must have had  About 18 safety wires  Yeah I'm sure  You know  Do you think  They had the best crew  Working with him  It's the guy  That runs the bungee  At a fucking  Poughkeepsie carnival  It's great  Missing a couple of bolts  But it shouldn't be a problem  Don't worry about it  Would you have done that  You've got some duct tape  Would you have done that  I'd have done that 
[02:32:30]  Yeah yeah  They're safe  Anything that you see us do  It's you know  It's pretty fucking safe  Other  You know  You just need the nuts  To go  Okay  I'm not scared of heights  Are you  No I'm not scared of heights  No if you've got  A fear for heights  Then you don't want  To be doing that  But no  It's pretty safe  It's not like  You're trying to jump  From one  A moving vehicle  To another  And if you miss  You're going to  Smash yourself to pieces  Yeah  I mean you're just  On a wire  So you're just  Running around  It's just like  Being on a fairground ride  It's pretty safe  It's not like 
[02:33:00]  You've got  Exact some skill  To try and  You know  You're kind of  Just along for the ride  Yeah you're just  Along for the ride  Yeah  But that's just  Fucking  My hands sweat  When I think of that  When he's running  Down the side  Of the building  Like the fact  I know it's safe  But it's like  What if  You just hear  The feeling you'd have  Of floundering  All the way down  Going this could have  Been avoided  But Jason's  Ruining movies for us  I want to know  That there's a chance  That something could  Go wrong 
[02:33:30]  With this shit  Of course there's a chance  Everybody's got a bad day  At work  And you know  It could be the guy  Who's job is to  Tie the fucking knot  But I don't want to hear  He's just the one  For the ride  I like to think  There's some weird timing  That he's got to figure out  Here's how you know  It could be a problem  They shot that  The last day of filming  Yeah there you go  That's the indicator  That's funny  Certain things can happen  People are killed  Stuntmen are killed  I mean it's not a fucking  Yeah they have been  Yeah you know  I think the most dangerous thing  Is when there's a guy  On the trigger  That has to go boom  And press the explosion  Time it right  And if he gets it wrong 
[02:34:00]  Huh excuse me  Yeah make sure nobody's  In the wrong place  At the wrong time  Yeah they're the ones  That hold a lot of  Responsibility  The pyro guys  You're in a lot of movies  Where they have  The weapon masters  The guys that  Have to handle the guns  And make sure that  They're not live  Yeah  I mean for the most part  They're real guns  That just have  Blank ammunition in there  That's correct  Yeah yeah  So I mean you could  Definitely still get hurt  Is that how Brandon Lee  Died  Is that how Brandon Lee 
[02:34:30]  It is right  He got  And John Eric Hexum  Who's that  That's right  I think something  Got wedged into  In the barrel  I think there was  Something got wedged  Into the barrel  Oh wasn't that  An actual bullet  It was something else  Yeah something else  It was wadding or something  Right  Yeah and it got  Stuck in there  And I mean  I might be wrong  But it's usually  They're fucking around  And doing things  They're not supposed  To be doing with them  At the time  It's rarely a  You know  Oh someone put something  In there  And they went through  The scene  And it happened  Like John Eric Hexum  He put the gun  To his head  Who is he 
[02:35:00]  And pulled the trigger  He was on a series  I can't remember  The name of the series  I remember his dumb name  But not the name of the series  And he put it next to his head  And the concussion  From the blank  Actually dislodged  The piece of his skull  And it went right  Into his brain  Like a bullet  Oh yeah  You can kill yourself  With a blank  Absolutely  Really  Oh yeah  Very dangerous  Still  But every minute  You know  We're shooting blanks  All the time  But you've got to be  There's the distance  The safe distance  Is a big thing  Yeah  There are always eyes  Too close  You can't  Don't put it  So if I'm pointing 
[02:35:30]  The gun at you  It's got to be like that  Yeah  Usually film it in a way  Where it looks like  Yeah  Why do they have  Why not just use it  Like where the  Inside of the gun  Is filled with something  Like lead  Or it's a solid  One solid piece  Not a real gun  Because you've got to get  The muzzle flash  You've got to get that  Oh right  That's exactly  The action of the weapon  Too  Yeah  Yeah  The action has to go  They have a plugged gun  They do have a plugged barrel  So if you want to do  Short  And then they do  They put the flesh in  In post  But it's more expensive  CGI  Did I just sound like 
[02:36:00]  I know nothing about guns  Or the movie business  Why not use a fake one mister  Naive shit  I made a couple of videos  At the house  Where I used CGI  And stuff  And it looks  The effects you could do now  With After Effects  And stuff  It looked really amazing  But there's just something  About that  The recoil  The flash  The recoil  If it doesn't have the recoil  Yeah yeah  It has to have  A little bit of smoke  It has to have a little bit of recoil 
[02:36:30]  It has to have the kickback  Yeah  What is that feeling  And the slide has to slide  Right right  You need the slide  You know the brass  Needs to come out  What does that feel like  When you're shooting at somebody  Even though you know it's a blank  It's like you're still shooting at somebody  Huh  Yeah but it's  You know it's a blank  But I would love to do that  You would love to do that  I really would yeah  Yeah  But not tell them it's a blank  And then like make a prank show  Where I'm walking down the street  Just fake shooting at people  And they're like  Oh that would be great  Oh my god  And then they could have the up  There's a lot of people  I'd like to do that too  Yeah  I can't wait for the part of the show 
[02:37:00]  Where the cops don't fake shoot you  Because that's what would happen  Well it's called season finale  Yeah  Are you proficient with weapons  Do you shoot much real guns  Yeah  They make sure that you get good at that stuff  You know  They take you to the gun range  And they show you how to go on  You should learn how to like  Shoot a real one  Before you do that  Just so you have the respect  Yeah  For the gun  You have to really understand  About the safety  Yeah 
[02:37:30]  The on set safety  Is a big thing  You know  You can't be running around  As soon as you've done the shot  You have to give it to the gun handler  Yeah  Yeah  You can't run around  Having a cup of tea  With the old gun  Yeah  So as a British subject  What do you think of the assault  Bands weapon  The what?  Assault Bands weapon  Assault Bands weapon  Assault Bands weapon  Damn it  This is what eager boy wants to ask 
[02:38:00]  When you're doing a film like that  You guys are all major A-list guys  I mean you know  Schwarzenegger, Stallone  Is there a difference in the size of the trailer  Or is it like everyone gets the same  I hear Will Smith  Has a fucking tractor trailer  That opens up  Basically a house  A house  They wouldn't let him park  With a roof deck  Yeah like a two level thing  But they wouldn't let him park it  On a lot of the streets of New York  Right  They made him move it  It was so ridiculously big 
[02:38:30]  And over the top  Yeah  And you know Arnold's on that level  And so is Stallone  And I'm sure you're on that level  But when you're doing one  Do you guys all get that  Or do they just fucking  Kind of size it down  Like look  It depends you know  It depends who you are  I mean there is a  There is a standard thing  That most people get  And if someone wants to  You know  Be Flash  Right  They've got their own thing  And then you know  The big movie stars get that  Who's got the best one  You've ever been in  You know I haven't been in  Any of those big ones  Oh really  It's funny when you go  And make a movie back in England 
[02:39:00]  You go  Is that the portal  They go  No it's his fucking trailer  It's nothing like Hollywood  Back over there  I did a movie called  Furry Vengeance  Obviously you've seen it  It's about talking animals  You know  It's a great moment  And me and Patrice  Were in these honey wagons  And it was so small  There's no bathroom  So I just pissed in the sink  All day  Oh my god  Yes  I'm just going to take  A lot of leaks  So what 
[02:39:30]  I'm just going to do a series  I'm starting  Called Hollywood Glory  That's the opening story  But you'd piss in the sink  If you had a bathroom anyway  Oh absolutely  That's true  It was actually in the common area  Just showing everybody  Who was boss  But you do hear stories  About people measuring the trailer  And you know  Right  I think that one's  Six inches longer than  You know  Some stupid story like that  You've heard  That's got to cause resentment  Without any names  Because I know  You don't want to do that  But was there anybody  With a little more ego  On those sets  The set of Expendables  Than other people 
[02:40:00]  Not only Expendables  No  I think everyone sort of  Keeps an even keel  You know  Slides the head honcho  And everybody respects him  So yeah  I think everyone sort of  Behaves themselves  Yeah  Yeah  I know it doesn't sound that way  But I guess  Because guys who are that  Like you know  Schwarzenegger doesn't need  To prove who he is  Stallone doesn't need  To prove who he is  That's true  Yeah  There's almost like  A mutual respect  Because they're all  The biggest stars in the world  So everyone sort of  Keeps their heads on  You know  Because someone started 
[02:40:30]  To get out of line  They just stand out  You know  Yeah  You had to have been  On some sets though  Where you're like  Oh that guy's a fucking asshole  Quite a few  Have you ever thought  That people might think  You were that guy  Of course  More often than not  Jesus  You never want to think that  God damn  Not Jason  You look at Charlie Sheen now  And I don't know  If he had that girl fired  Or whatever  There was something going on  Oh right 
[02:41:00]  And I'm just like  I don't know what happened  Because I like Charlie Sheen  I've never met him  But I like his work  And I want to believe  He's a good dude  I'm starting to think  He's the problem  He might be man  I'm starting to think  He might be  He might have some issues there  But I'm like  What a lousy work environment  To have that conflict  That's his co-star  She's now out of the series  Is she out  Or is she going to be out  I thought she read that yesterday  He wanted her out  Or something  Yeah they had problems  That's some pull though  That's having some pull  If you could do that  It's a scumbaggy move  But you know  It depends on what she did too 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  Yeah  She got the yogurt wrong  Wouldn't fuck him  Well goodbye  That's what's going on  Jason's movie by the way  Is called Redemption  It's in theaters June 28th  Which is  Today is the  It's a week from today  Cool  Do you panic about  Opening weekends  And stuff like that  Do you really  Do you watch that  Do you really care  About what's happening  Or do you just kind of  Short cares  Well I don't mean you care  But I mean  How much do you follow it  You get told what it is 
[02:42:00]  I mean obviously  You've got to have an idea  Of whether the movie's  You know any good or not  And whether people  Want to see that kind of film  And of course  It makes a big difference  Because if they  Consistently don't make any money  That's your career's over  So that's the end of that  So it's you know  It's an important fact  Do you do independent movies at all  Or do you not want to do them  Like something weird  Low budget  Just because you like the script  Yeah I've done a couple of those  I mean even Lockstock  That was independent 
[02:42:30]  That was a small thing  I think that was made for  Like 900 grand  Jesus  Wow  Yeah we shot it in five weeks  Just a cult favorite now  Yeah  So great films get made  For no money at all  And you know what  People want to be involved  With you know  Quality work  So it's not always  The big budget things  That people want to be a part of  You know  A lot of the actors  Really want to  Attach themselves  To great material  And a lot of the good material  Don't always come through 
[02:43:00]  The way of a studio  It's good to have that balance  Of you know  I artistically  I have my integrity  And holy shit  I gotta pay the mortgage  Yeah  You know  Those type of things  I think  Who put it best  God damn  Michael Madsen  Yeah Madsen was great  Madsen put out a list  He actually had a list  Of movies  And he  Explained why he did it  A reason why he did it  It's like  Child support  And then he's like  Oh I really liked  Doing this one 
[02:43:30]  You know  But most of them  Were just like  Oh yeah  That one  The water heater  Blew up  It's just fucking great  Hey  Very honest  I think Michael Campbell  He said that one  Was the house  In Tuscany  That one  Yeah  It's amazing  How many British actors  Somebody pointed out to me  How many British actors  Are playing like  Like American superhero  You look at fucking  Like the Dark Knight  It was like  They were all British  British actors  Are killing us  I mean it was  Batman  The Joker  Obviously Michael Caine 
[02:44:00]  And somebody else  On that  Spider-Man's a Brit  Superman's a Brit  Yeah  Fucking those Brits  Get everywhere  I know right  Yeah that is true  It's because British actors  Are trained  You know  They actually  Are trained to act  You know  America is  90% of the time  It's just  You  That's right  The lead  The Walking Dead  Is British  Andrew Lincoln  And fucking  The guys from  The Wire  Are British actors  Are there any  American actors  Going over there  And then British people  Going we didn't know  He was American  No 
[02:44:30]  Because there's not  A lot of great stuff  You know  We don't make any  All we have is James Bond  And that's it  That's pretty much it  The others are  Period dramas  With everyone's  Wearing tights  And  You know  And wigs  So the appeal's  Not quite the same  Be a superhero  Or put these tights  On for ten weeks  Have you ever played  Have you ever done  Like stage acting  Nah  I've never done  Any sort of acting  Yeah  Last time you were in 
[02:45:00]  We went through  The whole thing  Of how you  Got into movies  And it was kind of  A very  You know  By chance thing  Yeah  You know  I was just  You know  Asked to do  A film that  Didn't require  Any acting  Right  Right  Yeah  It was just  Sort of play yourself  In a movie  You're a working guy  And working on the streets  Yeah  Working on the streets  Yeah  It's a great story  Do that  But say these words  It's  You know  It was  That's how I got into it  And then Guy Ritchie said  Look don't bother  Trying to do any 
[02:45:30]  Don't go to any  Acting classes  It's  No heavy lifting  I swear  That's exactly  The opposite advice  They give me  Wow  You would have been  A great James Bond  Yeah  The bold Bond  I think so  You know  The way Fleming  Wrote the character  Was a guy  Who was really  You know  He wasn't like  Roger Moore  You know  He wasn't  Some milk toasty guy  He was a real  Yeah more like  The Casino Royale  Right  Yeah  I like Daniel Craig  I think  I don't really pay 
[02:46:00]  Much attention to Bond  But I like him  I think he's really good  Yeah I think he does  Craig's the best  Since Connery  For sure  He's a good Bond  Yeah since Connery  He's the best  Since Connery  Yeah they took  The tongue in cheek  Out of it  Because it got  Especially with  Roger Moore  It wound up  Just getting ridiculous  At that point  It got so far away  From  You know  Everything was a joke  You never felt  Like the character  Was ever really  In any danger  I think he got  The point  Fuck you  I think  It was terrible right  Oh god  It's like a skin crawl 
[02:46:30]  Just shoot the fuck  And be done with it  Oh my  Wow  Yeah it seems like  They became  Did you see that  Documentary on Bond  There was  About the lawsuits  That had been involved  And the fight  Over that name  Man that is an  Ugly ugly underbelly  A lot of money  A lot of money  It was the most popular  Franchise in history right  Yeah the James Bond  All the problems  With Sean Connery  And then the people  Who took over  I think you know  The two creators  Not Fleming  But the guy  Who made  Broccoli  Alba Broccoli  Yes 
[02:47:00]  Broccoli  I can't believe  That fucking  Home run question  I had  I should have  Saved that  For the end  You gotta wrap  With that one  You know  Not to hit you  With a curveball here  But chamomile tea  Comment  If you would have  Spit on me  Nobody would have  Questioned it  You could still  Do it if you want  But yeah  There was a whole  Big bunch of lawsuits  What was the movie  That got made twice  There was one movie  That one Bond  That got made  Thunderball  Oh right  Okay  Never say never again  Was the 
[02:47:30]  Because it was  Originally written  As a screenplay  Fleming wrote  Thunderball as a screenplay  So  You know your Bond  Shit  I'm big on the bone  Nice  Have you seen them all  I've seen them all  Some of them twice  Which is your favorite  Goldfinger  Goldfinger  Dr. No  Yeah  You know  All the Connerys  Really are great  Do you hate the Roger Moores  Or you don't  I hate them  I hate them with a passion  Do you really  I really do  We had them in here  Did you  Did you guys get them  Over there  On ice  Rob wouldn't have it  No  I put my foot down 
[02:48:00]  He was cool  Connery or nothing  Yeah  He won't be a part of it  He just won't  Didn't they do something  At the Oscars recently  With those guys  And he just will not  Well he's kind of  He kind of went on  To have a pretty good career  After the Bond  Is it alright  I don't think he really  Got typecast  He did good  Roger Moore on the other hand  After Bond  What are you doing  The cannonball run  He'll be a Walmart greeter  Before too long  What's the best story  George  Lazenby  What's that story about  George Lazenby  Was the guy  Who replaced Connery 
[02:48:30]  Right  For  On Her Majesty's Secret Service  Which is one of the better books  It's the one where  James Bond gets married  And Lazenby  Was this nobody  Who they picked  To take Connery's place  When Connery first left  Only made one  Wow  One and done  And he was Australian  Didn't they do well  He was good at it  It did well  And he actually wasn't bad  Yeah  He actually wasn't bad  But then they went to  And then it was a couple of years  Before they actually made it  But he fucked it up  He took like really  Weird advice  People said  Like some guy  Told him  Like this guru  Told him 
[02:49:00]  Like you  Play it like a mime  Yeah  Bond is stuck in a glass box  Yes  Well that's hard advice  That's right  Yeah sing your lines  People will love that  Really  Bond  Make them bold choice  Make them Chinese  Yeah  So what did he do wrong  I don't remember  You don't remember  Yeah  I'm sure listeners are out  They want to kill me  But he blew it  By changing something  That was working for him  And  He just screwed it up  And they moved on from him  And they were like  You're just  Fuck you  Yeah and they moved on  Poor bastard 
[02:49:30]  You know if you get a franchise  Like that  Play it smart  The fucking Pete Best  Of James Bond movies  Wow  You just don't want to be  The Pete Best of anything  No  No  Unless it's the Beatles  Or the identical triplets  We gotta wrap up with Jason  I guess  That sucks  Yeah  Jason  Always a pleasure man  We like that you do radio  You're one of the few  Big guests  That likes to do radio  And is good at it  Because a lot of them  Want to do a seven minute  Fucking quick TV interview  And that's it  We've always had fun  When you come in too  That's a great laugh  I love coming on  Yeah it's great  I'll see you next time around 
[02:50:00]  Yeah absolutely  Best of luck with the movie  Jim  It's out  June 28th  It's called Redemption  And you know  Of course Jason Statham  Is great  And if you happen to be  Now the Hummingbird  Is the UK title  Is it still being called  Out there or no  It is  Yeah  Okay  Oh wow  But here is Redemption  Yeah  Okay so don't be confused  If you're with a friend  From across the pond  And he says  Let's say Hummingbird  Say I'd love to  And you'll be seeing Redemption  Two very different names  For the same movie 
[02:50:30]  That's great  I mean  But I guess  I kind of respect the fact  That Britain would call it that  Like that's it  You know  I like that name  I just think  England has a little more  Artistic integrity  They could stick with Hummingbird  America's like  Fuck that name  That sounds like a faggot movie  We're gonna get  That faggot reduction  No explosions in that one  Yeah yeah yeah  Exactly  But then again  Isn't it like calling it  If Hummingbird's a common name  For those things over there  Maybe they just  It's not a common name  For them here  So maybe that's like  Calling it Predator drone here  Right  Why would I ruin the interview 
[02:51:00]  By speculating  It was nice  We had a nice out  And I just decided  To go into the writer's room  And take a guess  Douche  It's always great  When you meet somebody  Who you know  An actor whose work  You admire or whatever  Because you always  Make up your mind  In your head  What kind of a person  They are off screen  And nine times out of ten  You're always disappointed  Because they tend to be  A fucking asshole  So it's great  To actually  You're exactly who  We hoped you would be  Wow Rob  Hug it out  Hug it out  Hug it out 
[02:51:30]  Hug it out  Look at he's crying  Thanks man  I'm absolutely crying  Shall we take a break  Yeah we will  Jason Statham  Always a pleasure  Thank you  Redemption  A week from today  We'll be back  Good Rob Bartlett  Yes yes I remember  I had lasagna  We're all very excited

[02:53:30]  You dick  I'm Baby Imus  That's true  Baby Imus  With the dick shit  Baby Imus  But alright  So Opie Radio  On Instagram  Anthony Comey  On Instagram  Jim Norton  On Instagram  I believe  Right Jim  You got Jim Norton  Yeah I'm uploading  The fucking  Home run  And not Sam  On the Instagram  Not Sam  I'll give you the plug today  Because you fucking  Did the Ricky Gervais  Interview yesterday  Thank you 
[02:54:00]  So that's what I do  In return  I see the girls  Got pictures  With Jason Statham  Oh my god  Oh yeah  They were all  Waiting for their  Pictures all just  Yeah  And I go in  It's amazing  I go in to tell  One of them  Can you please  Get Mr. Bartlett  A band-aid  And before I can  Ask them to do anything  Jackie has to go  Jason smelled delicious  What is happening here  I don't know man  Whatever they  They're excited  What do you mean  What's happening  Whatever they want  I guess  Yes that's the answer  They're excited 
[02:54:30]  About a guest  That comes in  You're bumming  Everyone out  You're a bummer  Come on Sam  Don't be a  Fuddy-duddy  Morale around here  Is great  And you're the one  That's got to  Stomp it out  Morale's been fantastic  It's beautiful  And it goes  I think the girls  Want pictures  Jason  Well I didn't want  Anybody  Leaving disappointed  Like the thing  That nobody  Disappointed  Whenever people  Get pictures  Yeah  What are you  Did I say  Disappointed  Of course you did  I am like  Did he say  Disappointed 
[02:55:00]  I'm feeling  Better now  Ban guns  Assault  That was a great question  Great question  If I phrased it right  Assault  Bans guns  Or a pep button  What did you say  I don't remember  Assault  Yeah  Or assaulted  I was trying to  The second amendment  Thing going  It was  See  By the way  I got a letter  From New York  State pistol licensing  In New York City  And apparently  They got this thing  Where you gotta have  A magazine  With ten rounds  Or less  But you can only 
[02:55:30]  Put seven rounds  In the magazine  So you leave three out  Yeah  Yeah  Just like the bad guys  Will do  No they won't  Exactly  Literal Jim  But I  So I got this thing  And it says now  And this is something  That no one  Knew about  You need  When you re-up  Your permit  You need to  Be able to  Present to them  What happened  To your magazines  That were over  Ten rounds  So if they know  That you have  This pistol 
[02:56:00]  Let's say  That holds  Sixteen rounds  And it's on your license  They'll be like  Well  What did you do  With the sixteen round mag  And  We want  Also want proof  That you bought  A compliant magazine  What  I know  So I'm sitting  That  Candy crush  What  What happened  But they are  Going to use this  To screw over  The people  Because when  It comes time  To re-up  Your license  A lot of people 
[02:56:30]  Don't pay attention  To every  Little rule  And regulation  And law  That comes out  They should  But a lot of people  Don't  And they're going to  Use that against people  They're going to be like  Now you've got to  Produce documentation  That shows us  What you did  With your illegal magazine  And then when you can't  They'll be like  Well then you can't  Have a license  And this is  Everyone that says  They're not coming  For your guns  No one ever thought  They were going to  Start kicking doors  In and taking your guns  Although you know  That's not out of  The realm of possibility  But they do it  In this way  They do it in  They change the laws 
[02:57:00]  Make you have to  Do something  Hope that a bunch  Of people either  Don't do it  Or aren't informed  Enough to know  About the laws  To do it  And then they don't  Give you your  Fucking license  Yeah but if you  Go to Chicago  You can get  Plenty of guns  Without any of that stuff  You don't need  Any papers  Nothing  Chicago is the safest city  Because you're not allowed  To carry a gun  In Chicago  That's why there's  Never any shootings  On the street  And everybody's fine  I know  It works out  See  I saw a documentary  That said otherwise  Oh  Oh and by the way  The mayor's  Fucking safe gun 
[02:57:30]  Mayors for safety  Gun control shit  In Boston  They were having  A little get together  And they were  Reading off the names  Of the people  That have been victims  Of gun violence  And deaths  And they actually  Read off the name  Of the fucking terrorist  Guy that was fucking shot  And that's not a joke  That had to be an oversight  They fucking read it off  As a guy  Who was a victim of  Who wrote  Was that you  That wrote  He ought to be  Put in there  As a victim  Of distracted driving  No 
[02:58:00]  Oh that was  That's kind of funny  No I did say that  His brother ran him over  No I did  I did  Oh chipper  How could it be  An oversight though  You'd think  Right down to the point  Where you see the paper  You'd know  And you read the name  Even if you have to  Stop halfway through  Right  Don't finish the name  You know what the name is  Who put the name  On the list though  You know what  They probably just did  A whole  They probably just took  Names  Give us the names  Of everyone killed by guns  In the city of Boston  And it's like  Okay here it is  Wow  And they read it off  As a victim 
[02:58:30]  He was a victim  Shit it  Wow  But this is what's  Going on in this country  And now like I said  We get this fucking paperwork  Stuntbrain just sent  A copy to me  He was like  Do you get this  And I'm like  Yeah I got that too  But it's things like this  They change the laws  Hoping that  Legal gun owners  Will screw up  And that's how they  Come for your guns  They want you to  They want to trip you up  They want to trip you up  And it shouldn't be  You shouldn't have a right  But given to you  By the constitution  That they're able to  Trip you up on 
[02:59:00]  And take that right away  But what does this  Have to do with  Spinach and rice  Well  Apparently Jason Statham  Yeah  Only eats that  Right  From breakfast  Lunch  And then dinner  And even his  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Snacks  Uh oh  She's just coming in  With a thing  Thank you Jackie  Thank you Jackie  She didn't give you anything  Someone's a little helper  You know what  She came in here  And gave Jim Norton something  But she didn't distract  The show  That's right  And that's why  I'm thanking her  She's a walking distraction 
[02:59:30]  All she does is distract  So is that little Sydney  You're a bummer  So is that little Sydney  That little fucking Sydney  Distracting everybody  I got a note  During the break  Sal wants to come in here  And defend the spinach and rice thing  With Jason Statham  So excited  Because he put the one sheet together  Yeah I put it together  I just went  I don't know why that mic's not working  But maybe it  Seven  Seven  Maybe it has a sensor on it  For fucking shit  That's interesting  And not 
[03:00:00]  And it shuts off  I'm just saying  That like  This would be off  I wasn't pulling this  I'll look at you  Jimmy just look at me like  Yeah  You guys have like a  A policy  Like you're  A hiring policy  Not really  Basically if you intern  This is short bus over here  Yeah  Basically if you intern for us  We hire you  Yeah that's how it goes  That's pretty much it  Shit  Yes Sal  Come on  So no  I found numerous articles online 
[03:00:30]  Saying about that  Spinach and rice thing  So it's not like I just fabricated it  Oh good it was online  The guy said no  Yes  So Barry Abraham the other day  Said that that was  Like a private video  That was uploaded to Vivid  Well  We kind of blew that one  Are you saying  Jason Statham took a dick in his ass  Why don't you tell him that  I'm saying that he lied  What  Whoa  Oh really  Jason Statham lied  Jason Statham lied  You think Jason Statham really does eat spinach and rice  Yeah  For every meal  Well not every meal 
[03:01:00]  It's saying that there are spies  But he held back because  Because you would look like a wimp saying that  In front of us  You'd look like a guy who has a diet plan  Or some nutritional  When he trains  Thing that he does  It's like a badass  Imagine if you were strong enough to only eat spinach and rice  Exactly  So then if it was so badass  Why wouldn't you just admit to it then  Because he doesn't do it  Because he doesn't do it  That's what he said  Articles online are saying that  He even has an assistant to go out  To the cooking area on set  To order his rice and spinach  So he doesn't have to look at any of the other food  That's there  My internet sources are telling me 
[03:01:30]  Look I'm just  I'm just trying to defend my  My one sheet  Where he was getting the info from  Fair enough  I'll admit  That's fair enough  Fuck it  Who cares  Thank you guys  Right  It's your  News.com.au  Oh that .au is never good  Look  MailOnline  That's a UK  MailOnline  Yeah  Is that your site?  M-A-L-E  Yeah  You fucking suck dicks  Oh Jesus  Where is this anger coming from?

[03:13:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live  With my very special guest  Rob Bartlett  Hi  You got two mics in front of you  Yeah  So I'm in stereo  It seems wholly unnecessary  You can go back and forth  Between them  Whatever you want  Yeah  If you turn off your right channel  Rob will still be there  That's right  Coming at ya  Just chewing  I tried really good for the radio  Me chewing the gum like I did  Into both microphones  Dean Lou would be eating these donuts  He did  He brought in  We got to do something about the donuts 
[03:14:00]  There's two dozen donuts  Roland  Are you going to have a donut?  I had one  You did?  He's already partaken  I don't know  Partake  Because we have a guy  You must have heard  You've heard Dennis Falcone  On the show before  Haven't you?  I believe so  He's the old DJ  Who wants to be on the 50's channel  Oh yes yes yes yes  We'll make him talk up songs  I didn't know what his name was  Yeah he  Nobody should  He constantly  Is just harassing us  For free things  And I guess that's the tradition  Of radio  Of course  Is to just try to get 
[03:14:30]  As much free stuff  As possible  Swag  It's all about swag  But he's already  I guess he listens to his  To the show  In his cubicle  Or whatever  And he's already  I went to the bathroom  And he goes  Hey Sam  Everybody eat up  All those donuts yet  Or  We have to finish  Those donuts  Before he gets  His grubby hands  But you know what  Eric's done in the past  What  Eric doesn't like  Dennis Falcone  At all  I don't know  Eric you don't like him  Correct  I don't hate him  No  Well you have walked around  Last time we had  Some kind of food in here  We had extra treats 
[03:15:00]  And I believe it was you  Who went from desk to desk  Offering every employee  Whatever we had  Whether it was cookies  Or whatever  And you skipped  Dennis Falcone's desk  On purpose  And just  Made sure that all the cookies  Were given away  And I threw the box out  In his garbage can  That's mean  That's not fair  Nicole wants to come in  Why are you being hesitant  I don't know  I saw a head  I didn't know  That's Rob Bartlett  Well hello Rob Bartlett  Nicole  Have you met Nicole before  No I have never  This is Nicole 
[03:15:30]  From the morning mashup  It's so nice to meet you  I just saw the back  Of your head  And I got nervous  Because it was a  It made you hot  Didn't I have a very hot  Back of my head  It was very sexy  The front is not so hot  The back is wonderful  The back gets me  So much  What are all those  Yummy treats over there  There's two dozen donuts  That we're trying to eat  Before Dennis Falcone  Gets his hands on them  I am not touching them  Come on  No I have to wear  Something today  That I can't  Exposing the old belly  Are you purposely  Putting the two mics  In front of me  It's just  It's unnecessary  You just want to 
[03:16:00]  Make sure you're heard  No you know what it is  It's rock and roll man  Is that  Yeah  At least go to 11  Us kids wouldn't understand  No  Rob  Yes baby  I can't believe you don't know  Who Rob Bartlett is  No I'm not surprised  I am  Rob Bartlett  You've got to embarrass me  I'm wounded  Yeah it hurts  You've been in this business  For a certain amount of time  You'd like some kind of respect  35 years  There's no more I am  Why don't you let me know  What's going on  He's on the Imus show  Don Imus  Have you heard of Don Imus  Oh yeah  I've heard of him once or twice  I'm joking  Of course I know him  He's been on the Imus show forever 
[03:16:30]  Sorry I never really listened  He's been all over Broadway  That's fine  Oh  He's a stand up comedian  He's mad  He's angry  No I'm not mad at all  And  He's number two on the list of worst WWE color commentators  Is he two?  I moved up  You're number two  Awesome  You haven't beaten Mike Adamley yet  No  But I saw Bleacher Report  I was looking up while you were here  Bleacher Report put out the top ten worst WWE broadcasters of all time  Oh  And Rob Bartlett is number two  I was really horrible  Why do you love that so much? 
[03:17:00]  He doesn't even upset you  No because it's a badge of honor  Yeah  In the wrestling world it's a huge deal  Okay  People remember him  He was only on for a few weeks in 93  Yeah  I was one of the first hosts  93  How old were we?  I was 11 in 93  Yeah 10, 11 years old  One of the first hosts of Raw  Yeah  For the first 13 weeks  And then that was it for you  That was it  I was done  It was funny  In the article  It said that you were brought on  Because Vince McMahon wanted a quote unquote edgy comedian 
[03:17:30]  Right  So they brought Rob Bartlett  You're so edgy Rob  Yeah  Well no  It was edgy for about 20 seconds  And they realized  Oh you can't do that  You can't do that  Well Rob didn't know anything about wrestling  Wow  Well it's kind of like  It's kind of like Nicole  Nicole gets cast on this  United States of Hip Hop show  That's on Fuse  Okay  On Tuesday nights at 830  And it's her and two black guys  Yeah  Talking about hip hop  Get up  Nicole has no point of reference for it  I'm not black  And I don't listen to hip hop 
[03:18:00]  And I don't know anything about hip hop  But they put me on this damn show  So you're on  She's the Rob Bartlett of Fuse  One day  They will rank the worst Fuse broadcasters of all time  Thanks  Nicole will be number two  Thanks Sam  I noticed on last week's episode  You were wearing something  That at least displayed your cleavage  Yeah  Slightly more  Not a lot more  Yeah  But slightly more  Was that because of Opie and Anthony's suggestions?  It was because of Opie and Anthony's suggestions  Sherrod went down when I was doing wardrobe  And said that ONA demanded some tittage 
[03:18:30]  I believe was the actual  Tittage  Yeah they wanted a little more tittage  So  That's industry terminology  That's TV terminology  We don't want to get technical  Yeah yeah  I don't want to go inside  The stylist told him to F off  And he was like no  For real  No we need breasticles  He wanted some breasticles  Yeah  And so Sherrod actually was giving the okay on the outfits  Good  Yeah  Good  Yeah  Well he's a fashion icon himself  Sherrod Small  Right  Are you doing more cleavage this week?  This week  This week no 
[03:19:00]  I have a band across the breasticles  And then like mesh  The rest of the shirt is mesh  So I'm showing a lot of skin  But the breasticles aren't exactly out  How does the husband feel about this?  He doesn't give a crap  That's a great question  Here's what I was wondering  Because her husband is like Instagramming pictures from the set  So I know he's there with her  And last week on the show  I watch the show every week  Yes  And on the show last week  There's some dude  Who was obviously just on for like the favor thing  Because he's on a fuse show 
[03:19:30]  I didn't know who he was  But I guess he's some actor  But he was all over this chick  He had his arms around her  He was scooping her up  He was like  I was like  What is this?  How did the husband feel about that?  He didn't like it  And one of the other hosts said  Over there  That right there  That's her husband  And he goes  Yo it's just acting man  And my husband screamed  Yeah stop acting  He wasn't thrilled about that  No not happy  Yeah you can look  But not touch  Right  No touching  Yeah  How does your family deal with the fact that you're  You put in  Like I don't understand 
[03:20:00]  You have Opie and Anthony  And me  We're sitting here complaining about doing a morning show  That's pretty much all we do though  Right  Like you do long runs with Broadway shows  At the same time as doing Imus  And you've been doing Imus for 25 years or however long  Yeah  Do they like the fact that you're gone so much  Or do they wish that they could see their dad a little more often  I think that that factors into it obviously  It's how you say  Is the fat fuck here?  Oh good  Oh that's right he's doing a show  Yeah  He's out singing and dancing again 
[03:20:30]  When's he going to be home?  I need money  It's one of those things where in this business as you will learn  As you move along in your career  Young Sam  Now at the nascent stages of what is going to be a  I know  An enormously successful broadcast career  It's good to hear that from you  Yeah  And oh no absolutely  And you'll learn that in this business  You take the opportunities when they're offered to you  Because  Right  You know  Nothing ever happens  You know  When it's supposed to happen  You know 
[03:21:00]  There's either nothing  For months  Sometimes years at a time  And then everything happens at once  Yeah  And you have to do it all  Yeah  And you have to do it all  I mean you can't not  You know  Somebody offers you a part to  You know  Play Amos Hart on Broadway  You're going to say no  No  Right  You say yes  Make your Broadway debut  And then what happens is  That leads to  Little Shop of Horrors  You say no  No  But you also don't  Stop doing the thing  That's your bread and butter  And the thing that got you into the position  Where they're actually even  Considering you for something  See that's what I would probably do 
[03:21:30]  Like somebody would probably offer me  Like a horrible  Like I don't know  TV pilot  That was obviously not going anywhere  And I'd be like  Fuck you O&A  I'm going to TV  You would  And I'd just crawl back to the bosses  Down the hall  Like I don't know if you need anything  You know  Even if you just need a board op  Or something  Can I go get some coffee  Yeah  I have to run  But it was really a pleasure  Where are you going  Nice to meet you  I have to go interview  The winner of The Voice  Nobody even knows  Who won that show  She's here  Oh I'm going to take my picture with her  Do you like the show 
[03:22:00]  I love that  Nicole bring her in here  Rob wants to meet her obviously  Yeah she'd be a great guest  For the after show  You come in and do the interview in here  Okay  Let me see what I can go work out  That's a good idea  Okay  That's a great idea  Alright  She should  I don't think she's going to do it  Danielle Bradbury  Yes  I'm a huge fan  I voted for her  Let me try  She's not going to do it  She's got no balls  She's on the morning  She's the winner  Yeah 16 years old  Is she actually good  She's unbelievable  What are you doing watching The Voice  My wife controls the television remote 
[03:22:30]  Right  So basically what she watches I watch  That sucks  You come home  And you're like finally  There's some period of time  Where I'm not doing something  I'm not hustling  I can just  And your wife is still in control of the television  You know what that's married life my friend  And you will  Understand that as things go  Move along  I try to set the precedent early  Like Jess understands  Sure  And it's working now  Wait after 30 years my friend  Then come back and talk to me  Okay  So the whole Monday  Like Jess going  Are you watching wrestling  And I'm like it's Monday  What can I do  And she's like okay  That doesn't last 
[03:23:00]  No  No sir  How long  We've got a year under our belt  Of marriage  Right  How long do you think  Before  Before it turns  Yeah  What's today  My time's limited huh  You're fucked  That year was nice  Next thing is going to be  You're going to be  DVRing  Right  And then  That's going to get controlled  Because I need  I need space on the DVR  I can't have your  Exactly  Exactly  And I'm just trying to find something on YouTube  I just want to see a clip  I just want to see something  That's right 
[03:23:30]  It's over  It's over now  It's all about compromise  Well that's why you work so much  Well that's one of those  Maybe you get out of the house  You get your laptop with you  You can finally do what you want  I've got a TV in the dressing room  I actually want something  I don't want to watch  And your wife's sitting there like  You don't even have a show today  Practice honey  Yeah rehearsal  It's all about rehearsing  And there's that  There's that episode of  You know  Game of Thrones  Yeah I kind of see it  There he is  Who's that  That's Dennis Falcone  There he is  Dennis Falcone  He's looking and he's looking 
[03:24:00]  Talking up a record  Come on  Yeah you can come in Dennis  Now I'm not offering you donuts  Because there's  Did you hear what I was talking to  Rob Bartlett about  I wanted to see  Where the Bartlett's  With a dance  Why are you  No no Bartlett's  Why are you taking  Rob Bartlett's two mics  There's more  He wants both of them  He just shook my hand  You could use one of those  Or something  But he  I don't let him say one  He wants to use the two  Denny  That's okay  That's alright  I don't let him take one  Are you  You're  Stereo  Daniel Bradbury  Yeah Daniel Bradbury  Is on her way in 
[03:24:30]  Did you know that  16 year old  Winner of The Voice  That's right  I almost said  Winner of The View  That's how familiar  I am with The Voice  Are you familiar  With Rob Bartlett  Of course  He's a broadcasting legend  Comedy legend  Broadway legend  That's what I don't like  About  He's a triple threat  Keep going  Explain the threats  In detail  That's what I don't like  About people like Nicole  They come in here  They're young  This chick starts  As a receptionist  At SiriusXM  They throw her  On a morning show  No respect for the industry  No 
[03:25:00]  No respect for the people  Who came before  Yeah  They just handed it to her  Comes too easily  It's not like you  Who scratched and clawed  His way from the bottom  That's exactly right  To get to this position  I used to  Well  I was never where  These female interns are  But I used to be  One of the boy interns  On Opinance  Which is much more difficult  Then he knows about  Scrapping to get to the top  That's right  Gotta do what you gotta do  That's right  Now are you LAR or BAB?  What's that?  I worked at B103  Oh B103  Right  Farming though  Yep  Eric are you jizzing 
[03:25:30]  In your pants right now  That we got all this  Radio talk going on  On the after show?  I tried  I gotta do Eric's show too  His podcast  I promised him  Oh you did  Tell me  Eric is being very vague  What?  About his podcast  What exactly has he told you  About his podcast?  You know it doesn't exist yet  Right?  It's an appreciation  Of broadcasting  And it's interviews  With legends  Legends of broadcasting  Is what I was led to believe  And that's why  I've been asked  And you said  I fit in perfectly  That would be  Because when you think  Of me you think  Automatically legend 
[03:26:00]  Legend  Is that right Dennis?  Yes  He's a broadcasting legend  I would think 35 years  In the business  In New York City  And syndicated around  The country counts  I think so too  I'm not in broadcasting  For 35 years  I'm only in broadcasting  For 26 years  Show business  Show business  For 35 years  Somebody's on the hotline  Hello?  Enough with Denny  Oh it's Sal  Sometimes Sal  Sal desperately wants to be you  There's a lot of resentment there  Do you think so?  Oh yeah  Sal wants to be you  So bad he can taste it  Now Sal's gonna hate Rob  Yeah but Sal won't  Sal won't do the work 
[03:26:30]  That it requires  See that's what  That was gonna be my point  I bring this up  As a lesson  And a little allegory here  And a little fable  And the moral to the story  Is you gotta put in the time  Right  You know it's  It's 99% perspiration  Yes  1% inspiration  That's right  I didn't just walk into this place  Sam Roberts  You know  You know that Denny  Don't you?  I know you didn't  I know you respect me  I played polka records  When I first got into radio 
[03:27:00]  You did?  Yeah I did  I worked at a radio station  I had to play polka records  From 5.30 to 6 in the morning  Why would that be a programming choice?  Because it was a large Polish community  Riverhead, Long Island  Yeah  Oh Riverhead  Oh my god  Polka today  They have a Polish town out there  It does  And we used to play them off records  Was this radio station specialized  For just that one town?  No it was part of the market  It was 1390 WRIV  And they figure nobody is taking over this polka music  There's a lot of farmers that get up  At that time of the morning  Who are Polish  And I had the turntable in 45 
[03:27:30]  And to me it didn't sound any different  Right  The live reads are very interesting  For that half hour  There are a lot of sausage places  That advertise  You know what polka music is now?  What?  What stations use to stunt  Before they flip a format  Yeah  I still play polka  I play polka music when I do a party  Gio Roland taking the piss out of Eric in there  Yeah but he's mad  Because Fez walked in and woke him up  Because he was sleeping in the chair  Well Roland needs to take his naps  Hi  Eric how many Broadcasting Legend podcasts have you done? 
[03:28:00]  I think I have five  Wow  When does this show debut?  Are you just going to keep putting interviews in the can?  It's coming soon  Or is this just for you?  Are you one of those weirdos?  No  He wants to do the big release simultaneously  He wants to do the time travel movie  He wants to do the Legends podcast  He wants everything to drop on the same day  Right  I have 17 podcasts  Please listen to them all one after another 
[03:28:30]  Exactly  Why schedule them?  They come out week after week  It doesn't make any sense  It's kind of like when you're watching a show  And you do the cocooning thing  And you watch the whole season  Right  That's exactly what he wants to do with the podcast  He's doing the Netflix model  Exactly  Eric's sitting there going  This is 2013  At least he's got a business model  The business model is Netflix  Right  It's the Game of Thrones Netflix model  Right  And he's sitting there going  Wow he's not charging anybody for it  Well that's the thing  He's just  That's the thing  Putting it out there  Therein lies the rub  He's got half the business plan  Yes  Yes  Now Dennis True or False 
[03:29:00]  You're just in here to try to weasel some donuts  No no I do that to Sal all the time  What do you do?  I walk by the office  Hey you guys got any extra  I heard you guys got some donuts this morning  You got any extra donuts?  Even when he's being conversational  This Dennis Falcone  Sounds completely different  On the air  Than he does in the hallway  Absolutely  Like even right now  Because when you have headphones on  You have to speak like a professional broadcaster  I've never thought that to be true  And that's obvious  Okay  Well that's the charm of you  Is it?  That's the charm  That you are who you are on and off  Dennis is very old school radio  Yeah  Where there's an on air broadcast persona 
[03:29:30]  Eyes  So how does Imus  Have you witnessed  As Imus had to adapt  All these years?  In terms of what?  Like figuring out  Okay because  Old school radio was  At one point radio  Right  So you did the persona thing  And that kind of  Went out of style  Not that I went out of style  It's evolved  I mean the show is still  Very tightly formatted  I mean the show is  Is formatted like  You know old school  I mean there are  There are hard breaks  And it's not  Like the  The thing that you guys do 
[03:30:00]  Which is just  Streaming consciousness hang  Which is you know  Great  Like they probably wouldn't let  Somebody from the Imus show  Just say alright  Well then there's another  Hour here where nothing's happening  So you just go  Talk for an hour  No no no  They want spots  No  You know spots have to be run  Maybe you'll talk to Dennis  If you see him in the hallway  The business report  And the news  And the traffic  I mean the weather  All that stuff's got to be  It's formatted  So  And  But as far as his persona is  It's never really  He's never really affected 
[03:30:30]  I mean the early days  When he was like Captain Don  You know  In Palmdale  And when he first started  There was an actual radio persona  But by the time he got to New York  I mean it was just him  I mean  And I think he was one of the first  To be just him  Because you know  He's larger than life  To begin with anyway  Right  You know  So that's  That's where that started  And so  I mean it's not like  He's putting anything on  You know  It's not like he is  Attempting to  How weird is it like  To now  At this stage in the game 
[03:31:00]  Have to watch what you say  You know what I mean  Like all the controversial stuff  You would have thought  Happened so many years ago  And now is the time  When the kind of thought police  Are monitoring every word  That is said  I feel like everything  Goes in cycles  Yeah  You know  I mean  Historically that's the way  It seems  You go for years  And years  And years  One thing is fine  And then all of a sudden  It's not  You know  I think  You have a certain  Responsibility  In broadcasting at least  To maintain a certain 
[03:31:30]  Level of  Smart  You know what I mean  You gotta  How do we survive  Then here  Well I mean  That's a stumper  No you know  I think part of it is  I think  It's like  How do the guys  In South Park  Get away with  What they get away with  Right  You know  Where anyone else  Doing the same thing  Would be vilified  You know  And part of it I think  Is the fact that  There are no holds barred  And so it is what it is  And they just go flat out  And you know that going in 
[03:32:00]  And you know it going in  Yeah  And they're unapologetic about it  But they're also smart about it  Well yeah  Like they're saying something  In all this  Exactly  If it were just mindless  Gratuitous  Yeah  Then it would be one thing  But the fact that they actually  I mean they're some of the  Best written shows on television  I mean they bury them all  In dick and shit jokes  But under all that  There's  It's great  Right  Cultural  You know  Satire  Satire  I mean it's  You know the things  That they take on  And because they have  The benefit of being able to 
[03:32:30]  Almost literally  20 minutes before air time  Still make changes  And bring it that much up to date  That's crazy  That you could do that  With a cartoon now  Right  Well I mean obviously  You could do it with a cartoon easier  Obviously because you're doing voice over  Yeah  You know  But the fact that you can do that  I mean I don't know if you saw  That documentary  About them putting  Yeah  Into the episode  I mean there used to be like  You'd have to change animation cells  So that like they can change  Literally full plots of the  Well just don't say anything about  In radio itself  You used to have to 
[03:33:00]  When I first started with Imus  We were doing  I was just doing bits  Pre-recorded bits  To play the next day  I wasn't on the air live  I would come in  Two, three days a week  I would have three, four pieces of material  That's a sweet gig  And I would do  Well it was part time  Before I was actually  Giving a contract  Right  And I would record these bits  And they would play the next day  And it was tape  It was reel to reel tape  So you would do  You know the bits  And obviously we would  We would try to  Just in terms of  Comedically for rhythm and what not  You wouldn't 
[03:33:30]  Tone down the language  Because you knew  You could beep stuff out  Right  Well the engineer  You know Harry took her  Over to NBC  And then Joey DeFossey  When we moved to FAN  It was reel to reel tape  And they actually had to  Cut up  And put the beeps in  You know so you'd say  Fucking shit and whatever  And he'd have to go through  And they'd have this reel  Of beep tape or whatever  And cut it in  And then he would  Take together like all the  Fucks and shits and whatever  And he would make  A reel of that  Wouldn't it be two minutes  That was just for you  But now it's like  You highlight it  And hit delete  You're done 
[03:34:00]  Right  And you save four  Different versions of it  You're like yeah  We got the Uncensored here  We got this one here  We'll throw this one  On the internet  So I mean just in terms  Of technology it's changed  Right  Yeah  And it also seems like  Back then  And that's the old thing  Like Jack White  He still records on tape  Because he says that  It's the same thing  With kind of taking photos  Where if you have  A limited amount of tape  There's a quality control  Whereas now  You could just throw shit out  Right  And just see what sticks  Because I would delete it  If it doesn't work  We'll just keep going  Right  Like was the writing process 
[03:34:30]  Different or  Or do you still kind of  You know  Are you still in the head space  Of no we have to make  This one count  Well the fact that  We're also doing it live now  Right  Makes a difference  It's  It's  It's got to  I mean ideally  It's got to be short  Concise  And it's got to  It's got to hit  You know  I mean  And unfortunately  More times than not  It doesn't  Because it's just  The nature of the beast  I mean you try to  Make the batting average  As high as possible  Does I miss  Give you  Do you have  Does I miss  Have a look  When he's not  Liking something  That you're  Petrified of  Yo  Of course  Yeah 
[03:35:00]  Of course  I mean  That's the thing  About him  Is that he will  Never bullshit you  Right  You know  It's not that he's  Going to blow smoke  I mean I'm  I'm the biggest  Phony on the  Fucking planet  I just  I don't want  Anybody not  To like me  So I will  A minute ago  You said I had  Future broadcasting  It became clear  To everybody  No I was sincere  About that  Because my point  Was is the fact  That you work at it  And that's the difference  You actually have  To work for it  Right  You know  I mean  Unfortunately  This is a business  Where people get  Opportunities that they  Don't deserve  Because they don't  Have the talent  They happen to be  They fit the suit  Right  But you hope 
[03:35:30]  You hope that the  People who haven't  Worked for it  Will eventually  They'll get the  Opportunity and then  Fall flat and  Eventually go away  They'll get this  Thing for a second  Then they'll be gone  To me the definition  Of a successful  Show business career  Is one that has  Longevity  Right  So if you can  Maintain a career  For over a number  Of years  Then that's the key  And the way that  You do that is  You make yourself  Available to every  Opportunity available to you  And you work hard  You never rest  In your laurels  There's going to be  Flash in the pants  There's going to be  One hit wonders 
[03:36:00]  In every form of  Show business  The way there is  In music  You hear that Bieber  Talking to you  Unfortunately  That's kind of  Like a benign hit wonder  I think  You've still got  A couple more  You know  So when you're  In character  And you're looking  At Imus' face  And he's got that look  Are you panicking  Because you can't  Abort  It's panic  Pretty much  From the moment  I get there  To the moment  I leave  Really  Yeah  I mean it's  The sphincter  Never on the clinches  After all these years  There's no sort of 
[03:36:30]  You're just like  I know what I'm doing  At this point  It's all  Because you know  Obviously it's  You want to  To succeed  Yeah  The idea is  To make  To make the boss happy  I mean that's why  You're there  You know  I mean it's what  Anybody does  You know  So that's  That's always  The case with that  You don't  You were shaking  Your head a minute ago  When I was talking  You were saying  The people who are  Going to fail  Yeah  They get promoted  But Denny's  Experienced it all  Benny  Has sat there  It's like that guy  He couldn't even do this  You've seen it all 
[03:37:00]  Yeah he couldn't drive the van  How many  What's the ratio  Do you think  Dennis Falcone  Of people  Because you've worked  At all these radio stations  You've worked with  All these talented people  You've worked with  All these people  Who have no talent  What's the ratio  Of the people who succeed  Who are talented  Versus who are not talented  You know what it is  There's not as many people  Coming into the business  Because the opportunities  Aren't there  Right  There's not these  AM radio stations  That were playing music  Back in the 70s and 80s  You know what  I guess the people  Who are coming in today  Are good  Because there's  They actually want it 
[03:37:30]  Yeah they actually want it  And work at it  That's the thing  You actually have to want it  Right  I mean O&A is a perfect example  You know  They want to put on a good show  Yes  You know  They're interested  I mean Opie is a serious broadcaster  Opie is kind of  I watch him  And you can see  He's thinking about  Where's the next moment  Going to be  Absolutely  Where am I going to  Mine the radio gold  Out of this  Everything is  How the next moment  It's going to play  Well you have to think  Not only of  Where's the next moment going  But how can I highlight this one  Absolutely  You know what I mean  It's on the fly  Right  You know  And you know 
[03:38:00]  You let Ant  Just kind of freeform  And do what he does  You know  I was thinking the other day  About him doing  One of the old school bits  One of the Tyson bit  With the spelling  When he do the spelling  Yeah  Oh my god  So you've been listening  To O&A forever  Mmhmm  Do you get jealous  Because I sit there sometimes  Listening to other radio shows  And just get mad  Like even  Especially if they're doing well  Like especially if it's something  That I might enjoy  There's you know  Especially with stand-up comics  There's that level of bitterness  Yeah sure  That exists  It's like  You can't do well yourself 
[03:38:30]  The people who are your peers  Need to fail miserably  Yeah  Because the only thing worse  Than seeing someone untalented succeed  Is seeing someone who's talented succeed  Absolutely  Absolutely  Because then it's two fault  Right  Right  And you fuck  You're also talented  And you're better than me  God damn it  I can understand it  If it was just a shitty  Like luck thing  Yeah  Because not only are you there  But I shouldn't be  Right  Exactly  Like when you'd hear that  Somebody got fired  Hey did you hear that  So-and-so  The morning show  Got fired across town  Yeah  Great  Yeah 
[03:39:00]  Yeah  Yeah  But you didn't  Do you try to tune that out  Or do you not have it  You know  It's  It's  It's an emotion that's there  Yeah  I mean  You gotta acknowledge it  It ultimately gets in your way  You know  Yeah  I mean  I went through a whole bitter period  When Eddie Murphy first hit  Because you know  I started with he and Bob Nelson  We were the identical triplets  And when Eddie hit  You know  There was a lot of jealousy  And envy  And  That's crazy  Yeah  Because he really hit 
[03:39:30]  He hit and he hit hard  I mean  We all knew he was gonna hit  I mean  17 years old  You just knew this kid  Was destined for stardom  Is that how old he was  When you were working with him  He was 17  Wow  He started driving to gigs  He'd have his driver's license  Wow  But you knew that there was  Something there  So when he first hit  There was an incredible amount  Of resentment and bitterness  On my part  And it got my way  What was the first hit  SNL  SNL  Yeah  So he gets SNL  And then it just  Kind of spiraled from there  It was SNL  And then it was 48 hours  And then it was Beverly Hills Cop  And he was off at the races  And then does he forget you guys 
[03:40:00]  No I did a couple of pilots  For his TV production company  That's great  But you know what  In this business  You travel in different circles  Right  You know it's like  I brought Jeff Foxworthy  To New York  Because I used to work with him  On the road  Down south  And I was his best man  At his wedding  In Central Park  And he doesn't write  He doesn't call  I mean I used to feel  Hurt by it  But then you realize  You know what  A lot of it is  You just don't travel  In the same circles anymore  You don't have anything  In common anymore  Right  It's not that you forget  Your friends 
[03:40:30]  You just don't  And if you see him somewhere  Yeah  You'll probably be able  To sit down with him  You know  So then  After the Eddie Murphy thing  Though  Once you got over  That bitterness  Are you able to then  Like learn from that  And say okay  I'm not  I'm not going to be that guy  Again the next time  Unfortunately  Unfortunately you're always  Going to repeat mistakes  Right  Unless you know  I mean there's always  Going to be a certain level  Of jealousy  No matter what it is  But if you allow yourself  To be overwhelmed by it  It's going to stand your way  That's why I try to 
[03:41:00]  Surround myself with people  Like Sal  Because I just know  They will never succeed  And it makes it so  That for me  I'll never be  See that's the other key  To success too  Is an ONA  I mean in addition  To them being very  Very talented  They surround themselves  With talented people as well  People who are the best  At what they do  That's how you  I mean yeah  Because you hear  A lot of radio shows  Will not bring in  They'll bring in  Decent comedians  But not good comedians  Like they don't want  To bring in somebody  Who's funnier than the host  Exactly  They don't want to be upset  Right  Right  But ONA have 
[03:41:30]  You know  I mean for God's sake  They'll have Rob Bartlett  In here  They will have  I really demonstrated  My worth today  On the show  Creme de la creme  I miss does the same thing  I mean I miss  You know  I miss had  Carla  And you know  I mean he'd bring in  You know  Colin  And he'd bring in  Really really funny people  That's probably the difference  Between though  That next level  Of show  I mean  All these  For the most part  Shows that reach  That next level  Like superstar shows  Are not afraid of  Having funny people in 
[03:42:00]  Because they know  It goes to benefit  The overall product  I miss has always said  It only makes him look better  Yeah  You know  I mean he's very very smart  In that respect  Where he  He knows that  And he's the best  Fan  I mean if he really likes you  I mean  There's no one more loyal  More supportive  I mean he  He's a great person  To make laugh  You know  If you're funny  Because he's honest  Absolutely  And when he's in the room  And you can make him laugh  There's nothing better than that  And you know  If he hated it  You'd know  He wouldn't be laughing  No  So that 
[03:42:30]  But that probably  Because  Like my wife hates it  When I just  She comes home with a problem  And you give her the solution  And she doesn't want to hear the solution  She wants you  She wants to empathetic  And blah blah blah  She wants someone to listen  Right  I'm not doing that  You have to listen Sammy  There's nothing to listen to  I already solved the problem  She's not interested in the problem being solved  She's interested in you listening to her  Yeah I don't understand that  But that's  But that's the difference between men and women  The men  We want the solution 
[03:43:00]  Yeah problem solvers  Move on to the next thing  That sounds much more productive  Women just want you to listen  But that's the Imus thing  Like I would assume  That a lot of people  Maybe more thin skinned people  Do not want a person around them  Who's sitting there  And I'm going to tell you  When you're horrible  Like no  Please just tell me  That I'm good all the time  It would be better  If you know  You faked it  Everyone's horrible  Yes  Sometimes  Because I'm learning  You killed  You killed  You killed  You can't see him doing that  No  It's not going to happen 
[03:43:30]  Let me go to Jay  In Pittsburgh  What's up Jay  Hey how you doing Sam  I'm good  Rob Bartlett is here  Dennis Falcone is still sitting here  And you're welcome to still sit here  I'm going to go get some coffee  Why don't you know  Hang out Dennis  Hang out  Some radio legends  Yeah man  And then of course you Sam Roberts  Oh I thought it was all three of us  My question is  I'm getting out of the military next year  I'm in my mid-30s  And I've wanted to work in radio  Since I was a little kid  I mean I love everything about radio 
[03:44:00]  You know broadcasting  I just  I love it  I've  My first job in radio  I was working at a community station  Playing Vietnamese music  You sound like a young Eric Nagel  Yeah  But my question is  I'm getting off active duty next year  I'm going to go to school  For communications  Other than going to school for it  What would be the best step  Other than gravel  At you know  An internship anywhere  I mean 
[03:44:30]  Well that's where you start  How did you guys get in  I mean you got to start somewhere  And that's the way to start  Start at school  Get an internship  Go to radio stations  That are near where you live  Yeah  And hang out  Yeah I'll be in  I'll be in upstate New York  The Buffalo area  When I move back  Well that's the best place to go  It's like some place like upstate  Where they don't have a lot of people  So they will let you hang out  At the station for free  You know  Then just go and do grunt work  But the other thing is  Like you got to know  It's 2013 
[03:45:00]  And people  Nobody really knows  What's happening with broadcasting  So not only should you be  Doing stuff I would think  At radio stations around you  And interning  And getting coffee  Or whatever  And just trying to do something  But also get your own content out there  Like start podcasting  Start doing YouTube videos  I do some online radio work  I've been doing it  For about three years now  And I've kind of found  A little successful niche  In how to interview  And you know  Things of that nature  And I have other likes 
[03:45:30]  Film work and stuff like that  I'm like the guy in the 50s  That's in love with blimps  When airplanes are flying around  But it's just  I have a passion  And it's just like  I don't care if I make  $20,000, $30,000  The rest of my life  That's what I want to do  Well that's it  That's all you need  Yeah great  There are plenty of places  I'll be happy to pay  $20,000  Yeah you can make $20,000  That's not going to be a problem  Jack  Yeah  Alright but  Does  He should show up  To the interview  Wearing the fatigues too  Yeah  That would always  Always wear the army 
[03:46:00]  That would be very persuasive  To somebody who's going to hire you  Right  Because you've got to support the troops  There you go  Now does the whole shifting of the media  Is that a scary thing to you Rob?  I mean you've been  Like you said  Show business for 35 years  All of a sudden  Show business is becoming this new thing  You've got to learn to adapt  I mean like anything else  You've just got to learn  To move into wherever it is  Right  Traditional venues  Are no longer what they used to be  So you have to learn 
[03:46:30]  How to familiarize yourself  With what is  And then try to be that  And do that  While at the same time  Still being who you are  I mean you can't change yourself  But you have to change  The way that you present yourself  Or the way that you  Yeah it just seems like  Finding an audience  They're just new methods  Of finding an audience  I mean it's  I was talking to somebody  About filmmakers now  I'm doing this  Internet project  Where I'm working with  A video editor  And he has a movie  That he's been shooting  Over the past two years  With just like 
[03:47:00]  A camera that's available  Which years ago  Like 20 years ago  Would have cost  $35,000  Is now like  A $150 camera  Right  That you can shoot  A studio quality film  Yeah  And the technology  And the way  The business is now  Allows there  For that to happen  You have an idea  As long as you have  A good idea for a story  And a decent screenplay  You can create something  That can be  Not only shot  But it can be edited 
[03:47:30]  And it can be released  With all kinds of  Different channels  That were not  You don't need  A million dollars  You don't need  A million dollars  You don't even need  A studio anymore  To get it out  I mean  The stupid YouTube video  That I did  A Bob Ross parody  From that  Yeah you  You sent it to me  On Twitter  And I said  I had no idea  That you were also  A viral sensation  It was the weirdest  Thing in the world  I don't know  What it was about this  That just caught hold  I think it got  It got promoted  One day  When they were doing  An actual Bob Ross  Video 
[03:48:00]  Where was it from  Because it's this  Parody video  What's it called  I think it's  Bob Ross  Loses it  I don't remember  What it is  But it's  It's Rob Bartlett  And he's doing  A great  Bob Ross  You know  The Afro  Painter  Who used to be  I did a special  In the 90's  Rob Bartlett  It's not for profit  TV special  It was a satire  Of PBS programming  And fundraising drives  And so it was  An hour based around that  And the Bob Ross thing  Was one of the  Sketches in the show  And so  I was on vacation 
[03:48:30]  I think in Arizona  Went out of my laptop  And I had the show  And I just cut it up  Into little pieces  And put it up on YouTube  And I think  There had been  Like a real Bob Ross video  That got highlighted one day  And mine I guess  Came up with the search  And it just started  To get seen  And then it just  Kind of spiraled  So that  Now there's like  Two million some odd hits  On this stupid  Bob Ross  Parity video  And is it just some dude  That uploaded it  Or is it you  I uploaded  Yeah  Because that would be the worst  If somebody else  Uploaded it 
[03:49:00]  It has been reposted  And re-embed  You know  No you gotta get those off  It's like my  Night before Christmas  In Brooklyn thing  It's every once in a while  I will actually get  My own  Night before Christmas  In Brooklyn thing  Is sent to me  From somebody  Who's unaware  That it's me  So  That's gotta be  That's good though  It is kinda cool  I mean  But it's weird how  People weren't ripping you off  Things have a life  Beyond itself  You know what I mean  But that's what I'm saying  Had this been  Twenty years ago  That  Would not have been  Available to me  Absolutely not  But you gotta  Go on 
[03:49:30]  On YouTube  And start  Getting rid of all those  People that are  Ripping off your videos  When I put out  That iPhone video  As it went  Like  Everybody was just  Reposting it  Reposting it  You gotta kill him  I have people  Taking care of  That I know  Good  Making a couple  Of phone calls  And persuading  Certain people  Good  Good  Where are you  Where are you  Where are you playing  Tomorrow night  I'm at the  New York Entertainment Club  Which is  Located at  Belmore Theater  On Long Island  It's right by the  Train Station  There's the movie theater  And they do 
[03:50:00]  Live shows  Every other weekend  Or something like that  There  Gary Smith  The gentleman  Who used to own  The brokerage  Now does the  New York Entertainment Club  And I'm there  Tomorrow night  Is it all  Is it new material  Or half new material  It's 67%  67%  Wow  You have a challenge  Because  You see Denny  He's a professional  You have to  You have to do  The greatest hits  For the people  Who you know  You got to do  The Wheel of Jordan  You got to do  You know  Although I'm probably  Not going to do  The Beatle bit  But I'm doing  A new Pope bed  I'm doing a new  Thing about ASMR  Do you play 
[03:50:30]  Small clubs at all  Yeah  Oh yeah  I mean I do  Uncle Vinny's  Okay  Yeah because I was  Wondering like  Because I saw  I saw you  You played out  In Westchester  But I was thinking  Like you know  You always play  These like theaters  But how do you  Work on new material  Fortunately for me  There was no new material  So I would just do  The same shit  I've been doing  For the past five years  It worked though  It worked that night  You know  I have never been  The type to sit down  And actually write  Material on paper  And then try it out 
[03:51:00]  I'll get an idea  In my head  And either on the way  To the gig  With my manager  I'll spitball it  Or I'll just start  Going with it on stage  In a theater  In a theater  That's crazy  Well you know what  I kind of like  Painting myself in the corners  Because what happens is  Is you  It's almost like  Training a muscle  You put yourself  Into a position  Where you really  Got to deliver  Yeah  And then it's incredible  How focused you can become  At that point  Because then it's  Do or die  Failing isn't an option  Like I 
[03:51:30]  But I understand  Like to me  Even when I hear  Comedians that are on stage  In these like  In small clubs  Where they just go  Every night to work out  And they're saying  Yeah I developed material  On stage  Like I go  Jesus  That's got to be  Terrifying  But the idea of doing it  In a theater  Is like  It's crazy  It's just larger  I mean  That's the problem  There's a lot of people there  It's the same thing  I mean whether it's  Four people or a thousand people  It doesn't make a difference  It's still the same thing  Fail  You know  Failing in front of three people  Is the same as  Failing in front of a thousand people  If that's the way you look at it  I don't 
[03:52:00]  I look at a thousand people  Saying ah  That guy sucks  You have to just  One person  You have to  Serve  Who is it  That's Sam Roberts  And I was there for the show  So you were just sitting there  Looking at me  Like alright  I pointed to you  As long as he's laughing  On my Facebook page  It's me pointing in the audience  I'm pointing at you  Right  And I had better seats  Than Dick Cavett showed up  That's right  You did have better seats  Than Dick Cavett  You know who Dick Cavett is  Dennis Falcone  Of course  Of course  I would hope so  He showed up to  Bartlett's comedy show  And I had to point him out 
[03:52:30]  To my dad  Who I was with  And say look  There's a couple rows  Behind us  How do you like that  And I got the big point  That's right  You got the big point  Joe and Big A was there too  Big A was there  I also had better seats  Than Big A  I think Big A's going to be  There tomorrow night too  Does Big A just follow you around now  Yeah he just  Basically just text me  Could I get a ticket  Yeah I mean  Of course  I love Big A  Same show Big A  I don't want  I love Andrew  I love that man  He's such a nice man 
[03:53:00]  He's a sweetheart  He really is  He's a big lovable teddy bear  Joe in Tampa  Hey how are you guys  Doing today  Good buddy  You don't care Joe  Finally some honesty  I'm actually a young lawyer  And I agree with the  Perspiration inspiration thing  But I also have a question  For both of you  I sweat a lot  I don't really work hard  I just have a sweater  Double breasted suits  It's what  90 out today  I have to wear a suit  And I'm dying  I guess  Stop 
[03:53:30]  Stop whining  You're a fucking lawyer  Stop whining  Yeah you got this  Beautiful life  You chose to live  In fucking Florida  Okay  Oh no no no  The only thing  I got to complain about  Is dry cleaning  So I'm not  I did have a question  About  One of the things  That I've noticed  Professionally too  Is that  There's so many  Different avenues  For people to get  A voice out  But  There are so many  Different avenues now  For people to  Scream at you  For getting a voice out  Of course  And you have to be 
[03:54:00]  So careful  About what you  Say all the time  How has that evolved  For you  In terms of  Checking everything  And making sure that  Well I really didn't  Start too long  Oh  I think he's  He was asking you  Asking you as well  He was right  Yeah  Everybody  In like  Just the whole  Mainly Rob Bartlett  Though  For the most part  Rob Bartlett  You definitely  Just have to be  More aware  Of the fact  That  Everything can be  Taken out of context  No one is able  To know  What's  The contents  Of your heart  Or what your  Intention was  So 
[03:54:30]  When you are  Doing something  That is going to  Be seen or heard  Potentially by  Millions of people  You have to be  Aware of the fact  That a large  Amount of them  Might not know  What your intention  Was or what the  Point was  Anything can be  Taken out of context  And painted as  Whatever  You just have to  Be aware  And the best way  To avoid it  Would be to try  To find other ways  Of saying what  You want to say  But Ricky Gervais  Was in here yesterday  And he was making  Good points  And what I took  Away from that  Was you also  Have to just be 
[03:55:00]  Okay with  Offending people  Like know what  Your intention is  Exactly  Get that across  To people  And if they don't  Pick up on it  Okay  Well Sam  And not to  We're going to  Look at this  Stupid  Ridiculous  Pretentious  Discussion about art  But supposedly  That's art's  Purpose  Is to shake  Things up  Is to shake  People up  You know  Not to believe me  But I'm fucking  Doing this art  I don't know  I stick my dick  In a chicken  Basically  So it's not art  The chicken loves it  The chicken  With the songs  The chicken sings  Afterwards  That's real art 
[03:55:30]  But yeah  I mean you can't  You can't sit there  You have to make sure  That your intentions  Are kind of known  And people  Right  But  But you got to remember  That somebody out there  Is going to hate Santa Claus  Yeah  You know what I mean  That's just the way  That it is  Yeah  Like I do  What I do  You do what you do  And you just do it  And if you're trying  To impress  Then you're  You could be  Ryan Seacrest  Or you could  Actually do something  You know  You could not  Offend anybody  Or you could  Do something  He gets a few  Paychecks  So I don't  Well yeah  He gets a few  Paychecks  And he has  Probably got a job 
[03:56:00]  For somebody else  Ryan  Do you need  37 jobs  Well he's got no soul  So he just takes  Paychecks and money  To fill in that  Empty space  That's inside his body  I mean he puts  Nothing out there  He doesn't offend anybody  He doesn't  You could be bothered  At the fact that  He doesn't bother anybody  But there's nothing  To be bothered by there  There's something  To be said for it though  It's successful  He does it well  He does it better than  He does what he does  Better than anybody else  It's not something  I would want to do  And it seems like  An empty shell  Of an existence  But he does it well  Doesn't he Dennis
