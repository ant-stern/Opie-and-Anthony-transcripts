<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts mocking the notion of "nice" radio, seguing into a discussion about past antics, including leaving people in a London dumpster and Opie's experience shooting his computer.  The conversation drifted to the weather, climate change, and the extended summer, before focusing on the launch of their new, less explicit website, ONARadio.com, a counterpoint to their notoriously "filthiest website on the internet." They discussed the challenges of managing their vast online content, particularly material related to guests like Bret Michaels, and revealed an internal competition to acquire embarrassing domain names for each other.  A new daily $1000 cash giveaway was announced, with the ridiculously simple rule of being the tenth caller after a specific sound clip (starting with "I like turtles") between 7 and 7:30 AM.  The hosts predicted – and subsequently demonstrated – the difficulty some listeners would have with this simple task.  Recurring segments like "Whip Him Out Wednesday," "Morning Zoo Bit of the Day," and "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" were mentioned, with a caller's hilariously awful attempt at the latter being played. The hosts also commented on their billboard campaign, compared it unfavorably to a competitor's, and discussed the pressure to appear stereotypically gay in publicity photos.  A humorous clip from a news report on Joe Torre’s possible departure from the Yankees was played, and the show concluded with a plan to prank a radio reporter running a 10-mile race as Hannah Montana,  continuing to field confused calls about the $1000 contest. Rich Vos was in the studio, with Jim Norton expected to join later.

The $1000 contest continued to dominate a large portion of the show, with the hosts correcting numerous callers' misunderstandings about the rules and timing.  Humorous bits included a replay of a prank call resulting in a "100 grand" candy bar win, an absurd interaction awarding increasingly ridiculous prizes to a caller seeking Donna Summer tickets, and calls containing explicit and vulgar language.  Segments featuring listener-submitted "F.U." messages (with highly offensive language) and "Wake Up Your Spouse" (a caller using his cat to wake his wife, eliciting an expletive-laden response) were aired.  Kiefer Sutherland's DUI arrest and a detailed discussion about prison rape, fueled by Rich Voss's admission of browsing prison-related websites, took up significant time.  While a prison rape story was deemed too explicit for broadcast, the hosts comically attempted to sanitize it. The segment ended with repeated explanations of the next day's contest rules and promotion of onaradio.com.  Rich Voss remained in the studio throughout.


A "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" segment featured Jesse from Pennsylvania waking his wife with his cat's rear end on her face, with the wife's angry reaction being played. The show then extensively delved into prison rape, using excerpts from a website detailing the dynamics, roles ("hawks," "daddies," "punks"), and methods of coercion and seduction.  A caller, Harry from Memphis, recounted a firsthand experience, including the victim defecating on the perpetrator.  The hosts discussed the complexities of prison culture and sexual violence, touching on forced vs. consensual acts, STDs, and social dynamics.  Another heavily bleeped prison rape story was played. Missy, the recipient of the cat-butt wake-up call, recounted her traumatized reaction.  A "What Did We Learn?" segment followed, with callers sharing humorous observations, along with the hosts discussing their anxieties. Rich Voss contributed throughout.  The final portion featured jokes about Voss's short pants and a caller's midget sighting, concluding with the song "It Ain't Easy Being a Fatty." The show also reviewed censored portions.


The show began with jokes about the deaths of famous people, transitioning to a bizarre discussion about someone's aversion to water.  A significant portion focused on comedic rap parodies from the 1980s, with anecdotes and calls, often using derogatory language to describe the performances.  Rappin' Rodney and Barry Sobel were mentioned, and a snippet of Rappin' Rodney's act was played.  A news story about a fake million-dollar bill was ridiculed.  A call-in conversation playfully teased Rich Vos about his sexuality, based on an email expressing romantic interest, involving vulgar and sexually explicit jokes. A rap song dedicated to E-Rock, performed by Butcha, was played, along with a video of Anthony sleeping on air for approximately 25 minutes, leading to much humorous commentary.  The show ended with more banter, listener calls, and the introduction of "Wake Up Your Radio Host Friday."  Minor tangents included discussions of a listener's bad cooking and studio CD player malfunctions.


This segment featured clips from a secretly recorded podcast by interns Pat and Matt Duffy, revealing Matt's lack of enthusiasm for the show and desire to be a police officer.  A humorous anecdote about Matt's bagel order (cucumbers and cream cheese) was extensively mocked using profanity and crude humor. The conversation shifted to midgets in film and television, again with offensive jokes.  A chaotic and highly profane call with an XM Satellite Radio customer service representative followed, with the caller insulting the hosts and expressing preference for Howard Stern while trying to reactivate their service.  More Duffy podcast clips were played, leading to further ridicule of Matt. The segment concluded with the hosts promoting sponsors and using more vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Testing 1212.  Poe, poe, boo, boe, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, foe, foe, fee, fi, mo, mo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Peelers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff, and they just threw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny, and no one wants to get rock stars.  Is this where entertainment is going?  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one,  to feel his man hands holding your head like the sweat of a man hand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst, the worst showing.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Meh.  Why you?  Let's get the show on the road.  On the road.  But enough of this palaver.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Of the topless.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, what Ed said.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Howdy.  What's going on, Anthony?  Hope everybody had a pleasant, pleasant evening. 
[00:02:00]  A nice, pleasant day yesterday here in the Northeast.  And now it's going to get cold again.  Well, I guess fall decided to make its appearance.  Ah.  Which is kind of a relief because I don't know if I was the only one.  But two days ago, when I was walking around, it was 90-something degrees.  I liked it.  I was like, hey, this is kind of cool.  And then part of your head is going, but is the earth going to burn away now?  Nah. 
[00:02:30]  Are we heading toward that?  We got plenty of time.  We'll leave that crap for a couple of generations from now.  You know.  People like Voss have to worry about that.  People that just had kids.  You know, you got to worry what they're going to go through.  But we get nice, extended summers.  I love that.  Remember after Labor Day, it would be cold.  And you're like, ah, this sucks.  Summer's over.  Now summer's, ah, it's year round.  I like it. 
[00:03:00]  I have no problem with it.  Next year, it's going to be 100 degrees in October.  The year after that, it's going to be about 110 degrees in October.  110 could be a problem.  And then the year after that, we're all going to be dead.  Good morning.  See ya.  It's all bad, bad day.  Good morning.  Bad, bad, bad day.  Phone number, 877-212-O-N-A.  O-N-A.  And we also got a new website we want to start promoting.  Oh.  We're like a syndicated radio show. 
[00:03:30]  And we need a website that is very basic.  Like home base.  Because we can't give out our regular website because there's nudity on it.  Perish the thought.  There's nudity.  Perish the thought you see a boobie.  Oh, that just wants to start over again.  You know I see a boobie.  And then you got Steve's website, which just is, I don't know, it's a disaster.  Apparently, it's been voted the filthiest website on the entire internet. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I just read that.  That his website voted by everybody in the world as the filthiest website on the entire internet.  Were the people in Thailand allowed to vote?  Yeah.  And they were repulsed by it.  They were repulsed.  And they sell young children for sex.  They were repulsed by Steve's website.  They're into boom, boom, and yum, yum.  Boom, boom, and yum, yum.  And they're still voting his website the worst ever. 
[00:04:30]  They cower when they see that watermark on anything.  Yeah, well.  They cower.  So we want a basic, just a basic link here that gives you the O&A basics.  Yeah, I went there.  I got an email that it was launched, so I click on the little link, and I was like,  hey, that's kind of nice.  Yeah.  We just want...  Well, because our regular website, you know, if Bret Michaels comes in, which he does from  time to time, there's 500 pictures of Bret Michaels.  500 pictures, videos, bios.  And I'm thinking to myself, who the F would click through 500 videos of Bret Michaels? 
[00:05:00]  And it gets all confusing.  You know, if there's...  Good one.  If there's Rich Vos in studio, you know, there's three pictures, and who would want to go through  all three?  Right.  You just want one.  You just want one.  You know, but our regular website is still there for the hardcore listeners that need  to, like, kind of dig deeper into this whole thing that we do.  This radio show.  This lifestyle.  This community.  Yeah, so it's a new website that you go to. 
[00:05:30]  And what, the rundowns on this site also?  It's mostly for the rundown, because we want all the affiliates to kind of, you know, go  there, or all the listeners that are listening on all the different radio stations to go  there.  Yeah.  And I understand that if you're promoting, like, the hometown station you're on, what  do they call it?  What is the flagship station?  Flagship.  You know, people listening on YSP or BCN, you know, go around the horn here, the edge of  Buffalo.  They're like, hey, man, they're promoting another freaking radio station. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And it gets a little confusing.  So we got O-N-A-Radio.com.  And basically, that has the phone number.  It has just the basic videos.  So if Bret Michaels comes in, you're going to see one video of Bret Michaels.  Yeah.  Maybe a couple.  But for the most part, we're going to keep the clutter down, hopefully, on this website.  Keep the clutter down.  There's going to be a link for the instant feedback, because a lot of people are like,  how do I get to instant feedback?  Because we do have a very interactive radio show. 
[00:06:30]  So O-N-A-Radio.com will have that as well.  It'll have Steve from Bayshore's, yes, show rundown.  That will also have all the links of the things we talk about on the show.  For example, yesterday, we were talking about Jim Norton on Jay Leno.  Yep.  If you go to O-N-A-Radio.com, there's Jim Norton on Jay Leno.  You can watch the video for yourself.  And that's it.  Not 80,000 pictures of it.  No.  Not his flight itinerary. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Not any pornographic pictures of Jimmy Wits with various people.  No, that's all on the other website.  Right.  Steve's website.  It's on my site.  If you want to dig deeper, there are other websites.  What a mark, what a mark, what a mark.  But this one is the basic stuff.  Claim it, claim it, claim it.  It's mine, mine, mine, mine.  Right.  He's like an old prospector just out jumping people's claims.  It's mine now, mine.  I get the cursing politician from Staten Island.  It's mine.  It was on YouTube, but it's mine now. 
[00:07:30]  I claim it.  Look, the gear is on there.  The foundry cog, if you will.  You know, you speak the truth because I was talking to Tracy here in New York,  and I'm like, we need, you know, a website that we can just send everyone to that just  gives the basics of the show, like I've been saying here for the last five minutes.  And she said that Steve owns all ONA domain names.  So Tracy basically said, when Steve is willing to give one up, then we could get this website 
[00:08:00]  rolling.  I'm like, are you and me?  Well, Steve, I'm sure, would say, I just bought them up to protect them so no one else could  get them.  Right.  Okay.  Well, now we'd like to use some no.  No, indeed, no.  So, ONAradio.com.  I think I own a couple, though.  Well, Steve bought that one years ago, and he's been kind enough to give us one of our names  back so we could, like, get this basic website. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Jesus, he just scooped them all up.  Yeah.  I'm squatting.  I'm a squatter.  They call them squatters.  I'm going to squat on your website.  It's just amazing.  So, ONAradio.com has the phone number, the link to instant feedback, Stephen S.'s show  rundown every day.  Yeah.  That includes all the links and videos, like the kangaroo video we were talking about yesterday.  I'm sure that there's a link.  That was all over the news. 
[00:09:00]  One of the shenanigans that a lot of our staff plays on each other is the fact that they  buy up domain names that should belong to other people on staff or are embarrassing variations  of people on the staff, which is pretty hysterical.  I just yesterday got the renewal for my name and filled it out immediately, sent it in.  I do not want anybody getting claim to that one, especially one of these clowns.  They own stevecarlisi.com? 
[00:09:30]  Yes, stevecarlisi.com.  And variations, I believe, on E-Rock.  They got Eric's name.  And if you go there, I'm sure you'll be thrilled to view the meat spin or tub girl video.  And this will probably be news to him, but I'm also now the proud owner of travissteve.com.  Oh, Travis, wow, Travis didn't get his name.  Oh, that's horrible. 
[00:10:00]  I love that.  I love that no one works together on this show.  No.  It's all about just like bringing everybody down.  A constant battle to see who can screw the other guy over just a little more.  Yes, Dan.  Yeah, I got Nathanielbryan.com like a couple years ago, and I guess I let it lapse.  Oh, no, you didn't.  And I was on the phone with a guy like trying to get it back without having to pay too much money. 
[00:10:30]  And Danny's like, what are you talking to?  I was like, oh, I've got to get my name back.  He's like, yeah, I know, it's going to be about 60 days until it comes up again.  He'd already researched how to buy my name and had already had this conversation with the guy.  You never have to worry about any of you hitting it big where you're really going to need your name.  You know what I mean?  Oh, it's completely for just abuse purposes only.  You're saying that Nathanielbryan will never be big?  Wow, rich.  Out of those four, who's going to be the biggest? 
[00:11:00]  Look over.  I think you have a shot at it.  I do.  A slight shot, though.  All right, phone number 877-212-ON-A.  And that's also, of course, like I said a few times here, on onaradio.com, okay?  That's our base of operation.  That's right.  Things changing around here.  Yeah.  For the first time in our radio careers, I do believe Anthony and I have money to give away.  Cold, hard cash. 
[00:11:30]  Cash.  We're talking cold, hard cash to give away to anybody listening to the fine radio show.  Could be $20, $30.  Perhaps more than that.  How about $1,000 a day?  $1,000 a day?  For the next, I don't know, month.  Are you talking about a little more than a month?  Is there a loophole that it's a day on Jupiter?  Is it $1,000 a day?  I don't know what the hell's going on.  They gave us a nice website that we could get everyone to go to. 
[00:12:00]  They're giving us $1,000 a day to give away for a while.  And that means people listening in Philly and Boston and Washington.  Well, maybe not Washington because they're on a little time delay.  And Cleveland.  Cleveland, good afternoon.  How are you?  You're going to be about six, seven hours late.  A little late.  As far as winning the money, I'm sorry.  They're going to try to call and win and realize that it was hours ago.  And it's going to be some dopey jock over here just spinning another Red Hot Chili Peppers record. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, you want tickets?  Wait a minute, but it's for, like, New York.  I'm in Cleveland.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's not just for New York.  No, I know.  I'm just talking about if they call to win the money and they get a K-Rock jock.  Oh, the jock's just like, I'm...  He's going to give away tickets to some venue here in New York.  Oh, I got you.  I got you.  Y'all.  So we're giving away $1,000 a day starting, what, tomorrow?  Yes.  And we're going to make it so freaking easy, I can't even tell you.  Because no offense to the people that aren't, but we do broadcast to a lot of dummies. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And the dummies don't even know we're talking about them right now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not you.  They really don't even know we're talking about them.  But we really are talking to a bunch of dummies.  Yeah, see, the people that are listening right now to us, it's not you.  No.  It's the dummies.  You know who they are.  Yeah.  They just don't know.  Right.  So if you're not sure, it might be you.  Right.  But if you know you're not a dummy, then it's not you.  Then you're not a dummy.  No reason to worry.  And dummies want to win, too.  So we make it very easy. 
[00:13:30]  Starting tomorrow, $1,000 a day, listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is it.  Every morning between 7 and 730.  There's a half an hour window here?  That's it.  That's it.  And then don't even try.  We're going to play a sound clip.  Sound clip of the day.  Because you know we love sound clips on this show.  And we find some very unique ones.  You know.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  I love that clip. 
[00:14:00]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  How about this one for Cleveland?  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  And punt.  Oh, go ahead.  Ugh.  I would be happy looking like a woman.  I would get rid of all my male clothes.  And get only girl clothes.  So, you know we love sound clips on this show.  So, every morning.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Monday through Friday.  Classic.  I think about a month.  Maybe a little longer.  Wow.  Between 7 and 730, we're going to play a sound clip of the day. 
[00:14:30]  Yep.  And we're even going to tell you what sound clip to listen to.  Yeah.  This couldn't be easier.  It's like, here it comes.  No Q of the D here.  Yeah.  None of that dumb stuff.  No Q of the D.  It's a trick Q of the D today.  No questions of the day.  It's going to be pretty difficult.  None of that crap.  All you have to do is listen for a lousy sound clip between 7 and 730.  And when you hear it, if you're the 10th caller at 877-212-ONA, you will win a thousand bucks. 
[00:15:00]  Thousand smackers.  It's that easy.  And every day we'll let you know what tomorrow's sound clip is going to be.  So, if we're starting tomorrow.  Whoa.  We're starting tomorrow, right?  Starting tomorrow.  Sometime between 7 and 730 tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning.  We're going to play this one.  I like turtles.  We're going to start with I like turtles.  Okay?  I like that one.  So, when we play that tomorrow, Dan, you better remind me because I'm going to forget.  I will.  I'm going to forget about this crappy idea. 
[00:15:30]  That's fantastic.  I have a great suggestion for this contest.  Yeah?  Hold on.  Why don't you just spit the gum out.  You already got the big teeth to deal with.  You don't need gum, too, on top of that.  This is just an idea.  Just this what?  An idea that every day, instead of giving a thousand away, they go in to the finals.  And at the end, you find out out of the 30 people a contest, and they win 30,000.  Or whatever.  And every day, we'll let you know what tomorrow's sound clip is going to be. 
[00:16:00]  Hey, it's not a secret.  We're telling you what to listen for and when to listen.  It's so simple, you can't possibly screw this up.  Don't listen to what Rich Voschel said, because now you're going to confuse the issue.  It's $1,000 a day, every day, with the Opie and Anthony Show, sometime between 7 and  7.30.  Right.  So, tomorrow, you're listening for this, if you want to win $1,000.  I like turtles.  All right?  We could be playing it in between commercials, right out of break, right at 7 o'clock, maybe  wait until 7.30.  But it'll be there between 7 and 7.30.  Maybe in the middle of Anthony doing Angry Vince McMahon. 
[00:16:30]  You never know.  You never know.  All right?  So, listen.  You're going to hear it.  That's right.  You're going to hear it.  And you could win $1,000.  What are you going to do with that, huh?  What are you going to do with $1,000?  Try to act like me?  Good luck.  Angry Vince.  Love Angry Vince.  Angry.  Always mad.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  So, we got that going on.  We got the new website that supposedly is down already.  Someone is pointing out that it forges straight to 92.3 KROX page.  Oh, yeah?  And that matters why, Brian?  Why does that matter?  It's like a home base.  Can you get to stuff there?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course you can.  It's also Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget about that lovely contest we started many, many years ago.  I see the women on Pal Talk already wowing. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yes.  Nice and early.  Thank you, ladies on Pal Talk.  Of course, we got the webcams in studio.  We got the women out there on the highways.  And if they see a wow sticker or a homemade wow sign, they will flash you.  I think we should hear from some of the women today.  Who are the flashers today?  Where are you calling from?  Are you looking for the wow stickers?  Give us a call.  We want to know where you're at, okay?  But basically, that's what the wow sticker is all about if you see it on the back of a car.  And then I'm hearing that the station here in New York also is throwing up billboards with our faces on them. 
[00:18:00]  I hear tell that there is a billboard campaign going on.  I can only hope it's as good as some of the other radio station billboards I have seen around town.  What do theirs look like?  I don't know.  I saw one where the entire staff was dressed as the Wizard of Oz.  I did see that.  And just flaming fruit is all that conjured up. 
[00:18:30]  What, it was Elvis Duran?  Elvis Duran.  Oh, big queen.  Jesus.  Who knows what he is.  He was dressed as Dorothy in it.  Oh, well, there you go.  And some other staff members were dressed as various other characters.  Who puts that idea across and then thinks, yeah, this is good.  The Wizard of Oz will take a movie that was made in 1939 and just kind of incorporate it into our radio show and being the characters from it on a billboard. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I don't know how that gets your listeners, but would you dress in anything if they said no, no, no, no.  They've tried in the past.  They want Hardy, maybe.  No, they wanted us to like wear one giant T-shirt.  Remember that one?  They wanted a big T-shirt.  My right arm would be through the right side of the T-shirt and Anthony's left arm would be to the other side of the T-shirt.  And then, of course, our arms would have to be around us because that's the only way you wear an oversized T-shirt with a human being. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  So our arms are around each other.  They just want us.  They constantly, photographers for anything, publicity shots, billboards, they want us to act gay.  And I think that a lot of the other radio shows give into it and let the photographers kind of run their, what they want to do instead of just saying, no, we're not doing that.  No, we're not doing that.  Oh, what's the matter?  You guys got a problem with me?  No, it's not.  It has nothing to do with that. 
[00:20:00]  It just looks horrid.  Yeah.  It's not that the photographers are gay, you know.  Oh, no, never.  Well, this one's great, too.  It's like, okay, guys, I got a great idea for a picture.  This is a good one.  The article looks good, and we just need a photo to go along with it.  The picture.  We want you guys to dress up like priests.  Yeah.  And we're going to take your picture outside of St. Pat's Cathedral.  On the stairs, dress like priests.  You know, because it did that Sex for Sam thing. 
[00:20:30]  There it is.  Oh, there's the billboard.  That is the billboard of them dressed as the Wizard of Oz characters.  Why?  You know, that's like a big milestone in a career to get a billboard.  Wouldn't you think?  I mean, that's something that's pretty cool.  And to waste it in a Wizard of Oz.  If we make a movie billboard, I want it to be from the movie Downfall.  You ever see that one about Hitler's last days in the bunker?  Now, that would be fun.  Yeah.  Well, in honor of the Wizard of Oz billboard that is here in New York City. 
[00:21:00]  Let's not forget, it's Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday.  And after the break, we'll play the Morning Zoo Bit of the Day, but we also have to talk  about what one of the morning zoos is doing here in New York today.  Oh, yes.  Oh, boy, is it terrific.  I read that one.  And I think maybe we should have some of our listeners maybe help this radio station out  today.  Help them out?  Yeah.  We're so goddamn generous with our listeners. 
[00:21:30]  We've got to figure it out.  We've got to figure it out after the break.  But I know we have some great listeners out there.  We've got to ruin someone's day.  We've got to ruin someone's day.  We've got to ruin someone's day.  And it's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  I see we've got one standing by.  We'll do that next.  This is a favorite.  Yes.  People really dig in this.  Yes, absolutely.  Okay.  ONARadio.com.  That's the headline right now.  And also, our phone number is 877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:22:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Rich Voss in studio this morning.  I guess Norton's on a red-eye as we speak.  For the vacationing Jim Norton.  I think he's landing right now.  He'll probably join the show a little later on.  We'll find out how his L.A. trip was.  He was on Leno with Ben Affleck.  Yeah.  Now, I was watching that program.  And I saw when Ben Affleck came out.  And first of all, he looks a little different.  Something going on there. 
[00:22:30]  He lost a lot of weight, it looks like.  Ben Affleck.  Yeah.  And I know he's had trouble with sobriety in the past.  Oh, boy.  What are you getting at?  I'm just saying.  Because we're really close to getting Ben Affleck on our radio show.  I know.  He was very funny.  He was very funny on the show.  He had some really good stories.  But there was just something going on that made me think, perhaps, he'd had a couple in him. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  Yeah.  He seemed a little.  Well, we've been in their dressing room at the Jay Leno show.  Oh, believe me.  They hook you up, man.  Anytime you see me on TV, I have a couple in me.  They hook you up.  Those dressing rooms are just stocked.  Yeah.  Whatever you want.  Basically, it's like, look, drink whatever the hell you want to loosen up, man.  It's like, hey, can we get a couple of beers in here?  Sure.  What do you need?  What do you like?  What's your poison?  What's your poison?  That's what I like.  You loosen up a little bit.  That's all.  You don't want to do that little walkout after you hear your name all stiff, all petrified. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  How nervous do you get when you do the show?  Do you get dirt?  Beforehand, it is just unbearable nerves where don't talk to me.  But it's kind of nice that everybody's in the dressing room because it's a distraction.  And then you talk to everybody and everything.  But the second year, they go, okay, come on.  You know, if they mic you up, then make up.  And then you're standing in that wing area.  And then they go, okay, wait here.  When you hear your name, just walk out. 
[00:24:00]  And then they come back from commercial.  And when they announce your name, you can swear you're going to vomit.  You could swear you're just going to be the guy that walks out and pukes all over the floor.  That would be great.  But then the second you walk out, you're fine.  It's showtime.  Yep.  I go to the bathroom about ten times, nonstop.  One or two?  One.  Yeah.  Before I go.  And because my biggest fear is I'm going to walk out there and there's still going to  be something left. 
[00:24:30]  And right on TV, I'm going to go to the bathroom in my pants.  Oh, you're going to do that.  There was times, I'm not lying, when I did my special a couple weeks ago, I was going to  get an adult diaper.  A diaper just in case?  I was so nervous.  God.  Because you get, and you've done it a million, well, not you, but as comics, you do it a  million times TV and it doesn't go away.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm in the dress room.  I got the driest mouth.  But I figure if I keep drinking water, it's going to make me go to the bathroom even more.  Yeah.  So it's, you know, like catch 22 and I'm up there and I'm pacing back and forth going, 
[00:25:00]  I'm going to screw up what I do every night.  Just for tonight, I'm going to completely F up what I know how to do best.  I know.  Yeah.  I don't know how you guys that are recovering do it without a little bit of booze.  I'm not talking get snoted, you know.  There's a definite curve.  There's a curve with alcohol where you get, you will get better at whatever you do with 
[00:25:30]  a little bit of alcohol.  But then the drop off once you hit a certain point is amazing because it's like the edge  of a cliff.  Well, what you do.  Now you're useless.  When you're, when you're sober, as you go to the doctor and you get anxiety medicine.  Ah, okay.  There you go.  All right.  And you melt it down and shoot it right before you go on.  You grind it up and pour it in your eyes.  All right.  Listen, this is wonderful talk.  Well, we got someone that wants to wake up their spouse here.  Of course.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday. 
[00:26:00]  There you go.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  I mean, that was a noise.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  Don't be an entity.  All right.  I'm going to break and kill you.  And, of course, all those clips are from past Wake Up Your Spouses. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  On this fine radio show.  Trip down memory lane.  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's going on today?  Guys, she just woke up, man.  Damn it.  She just woke up.  I sat on hold.  I was at those.  Boss, you had to talk about your late night show experience?  She knew I was going to sleep.  Holy crap.  Oh.  I sat on hold.  Couldn't you just say, Boss?  Yeah, you get nervous.  I agree.  You think she's the only person sleeping in all your markets?  Well, so far, that's the only one we got. 
[00:27:00]  This was the one.  This was the one.  I'll get her to wow me.  Honey, wow me.  Hey, I got her to wow me.  It's getting a wow anyway.  All right.  You got a wow.  Well, we'll have to get you next time there, Chris.  All right?  I'll get you next Wednesday, guys.  All right.  And I was panicking because he was on hold since the start of the show.  Boss, talk more.  We need more people to fall asleep.  Congratulations, though.  That's the first time that someone was listening to you that they actually woke up instead of 
[00:27:30]  fell asleep.  So no first of all's today, please.  I bet the promo woke them up.  You think?  The promo's very loud.  It's like, wake up, your spouse Wednesday.  I don't think the radio is blasting in the bedroom.  So I think we ought to do it first.  And then play the promo.  Maybe if someone's calling up with that bit, we should go right to it.  Go right to it.  That's another thing.  That's the mistake we made.  Absolutely.  All right.  So in honor of not having one yet, why don't we play the dynamite?  Quarter stick of dynamite someone used to wake up their wife. 
[00:28:00]  This is from like two weeks ago.  Jerry, you got a stick of dynamite?  Quarter stick.  Oh, quarter stick.  Okay.  And you want to wake her up with that.  How are you going to do it?  Where are you going to put it?  Inside a pot, I guess, so she doesn't get hurt.  But it'll be loud.  And how close are you going to put it to her?  Right next to her on the bed.  No, I wouldn't put it.  No, no, no.  Not next to her.  I wouldn't put it right next to her.  Put it on the floor.  All right.  But away from her. 
[00:28:30]  Like across the room.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, get the phone close to her.  All right.  The key to wake up your spouse Wednesday, we need to hear the waking up part.  All right.  Jerry, the show is yours.  Go ahead.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  The best is like she's all groggy.  She just started waking up because you're in the room. 
[00:29:00]  What?  Lights the fuse.  What is this?  She was probably thinking that it's a nice candle.  He's lighting a candle or something.  Is it my birthday?  All kinds of things going through her head.  Is it my birthday or anniversary?  Is he doing something nice?  Ah!  Somebody heard that in Newark day, which is roll over and go, huh?  Yeah.  Go back to sleep.  All right.  Well, we made the radio column today in the Daily News.  Yes, I saw that.  David Hinckley wrote a whole column about the listeners here in New York going to bat for Joe  Torre after playing off.  Going to bat. 
[00:29:30]  After playoff whiff.  Yeah.  Basically, I guess radio listeners all over New York want Joe Torre, the manager of the  Yankees, to stay.  Want him to stay.  And you know what?  Here's the deal.  Joe Torre is a very, very lovable guy.  He's a very nice guy.  Nice guy.  You hear nothing bad about Joe Torre.  He's not one of them throwing stuff, coaches, or yelling coaches.  He just, he's in control, sits there like he's barely doing anything. 
[00:30:00]  But he has to go.  Yeah.  Because he did not get the job done.  Yeah.  He's been managing an all-star team for the last 10, 12 years.  When did he start?  Like 95, I think?  Yeah, 12 years.  12 years.  He's been managing an all-star team.  And they won, what?  Two championships?  Yeah.  And they haven't won in, what, seven years?  Something like that?  It's been a while since...  He's got to go.  It doesn't matter he's a nice guy.  He's got to go.  Yeah, it's...  You look at that lineup every year, and they should be winning every other year, at the 
[00:30:30]  very least.  It's time.  New Yorkers really don't like change like that, though.  Especially with a guy that they like.  Yeah.  It's one of those situations where the guy's good.  He's been in there.  They have made the playoffs.  It's just, you know, they can't close the deal these days.  No.  And they're saying it's not his fault.  It has a lot to do with the acquisitions that have been made by Steinbrenner, Cashman, and 
[00:31:00]  that's the problem.  But a head has to roll.  Steinbrenner's not going to fire himself or his son, so who gets the boot?  You can't single out a player or two here and there.  You've got to kind of set an example.  Joe's been there a lot of years, but it's time to go.  You've got to shake things up.  But what's interesting about this, so all the other, like, normal radio shows in New  York are talking nice about this whole situation.  And then we're mentioning in the same article, and it says, Opie and Anthony of K-Rock got 
[00:31:30]  comic mileage from Yankee announcer Susan Waldman's tearful clubhouse report on Tory's potential  departure, playing her tape over a laugh track.  Goodness gracious!  Well, what else would you do?  She gave this tearful speech.  Do we have that?  Yeah, here it is.  Then he said something that everybody in the room, we all looked at each other.  He said, this Yankee team has a great future. 
[00:32:00]  It's got a lot of young kids.  There is no question about the ability of these people.  They're very impressive.  He said, you think it's going to last forever, and this is rough.  He's your friend.  He said, this has been the best 12 years of my life.  I wouldn't miss this one.  Now, I was okay, actually, so I went into the clubhouse, and the coaches are sitting in Tory's 
[00:32:30]  office, and they are watching this.  And the tears that you hear in my voice are coming down the faces of the coaches in that  coaches' room.  Very hard.  Very difficult.  He said, I can smell your...  That sounded like she was going into that one.  Of course you got to goof on that stuff, man.  Yeah.  I hope the Yankee fans understand that, too. 
[00:33:00]  It's baseball.  I know we have a lot of them listening to us, but you got to goof on that crap.  And then the radio column today continues with this, that just, wow, how do we even compete  in radio?  I don't even know.  Oof.  We just don't come up with the good things.  The good things.  I guess not.  Once again, Scott and Todd are at it here in New York.  Brad Blanks.  Who the F is Brad Blanks?  That's his name?  Do you know Iraq?  Iraq.  Of course Iraq knows.  Iraq knows everything about crappy radio.  Who's Brad Blanks? 
[00:33:30]  He's an entertainment reporter for a bunch of stations.  He has a syndicated thing for a bunch of stations around the country.  Is he their stunt boy?  No.  Is he a stunt boy?  He's not even a stunt boy?  No.  This is like one of the first things he's done.  Usually he's at all the red carpet premieres and parties and stuff and has exclusive interviews.  Oh, really?  That sounds like a job that normally a gay gentleman would do.  Any opinion on that?  Is he like a Perez Hilton type? 
[00:34:00]  Because I'm looking at a picture of him and he looks kind of like Perez Hilton-ish.  He's Australian and usually very quiet.  Oh, really?  Well, this is just terrific.  Today, Brad Blanks of Scott and Todd will run 10 miles across New Jersey this morning.  A journey made more unusual and challenging by the fact...  Are you sitting down, folks?  Hold on.  He will be dressed as Hannah Montana.  Whoa.  Chased by the cast of The Wizard of Oz.  He's going to be dressed as Hannah Montana. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, is that great.  Billy Ray Cyrus' daughter.  That's like the new Britney Spears.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  For the people that are not in the know.  That means the blonde wig, miniskirt, and platform shoes favored by the 14-year-old tweener star.  Yes.  Okay.  Blanks will run from the High Lawn Pavilion in West Orange to Willowbrook Mall.  Listeners have been invited to guess how long it will take him, and the one with the closest  guest wins tickets to see Hannah Montana. 
[00:35:00]  I'm thinking we can wreck this guy's day.  There's got to be one listener that could do something special and wreck Brad Blanks' day  as he's running as a girl out there in New Jersey.  Get audio.  Where's no filter, Paul?  He's a pain in the ass.  Do we have a diarrhea truck in the area?  That's what we need.  I'm looking for a diarrhea truck today. 
[00:35:30]  We'll pay handsomely.  We'll pay handsomely for a diarrhea truck.  Well, one of those trucks that suck out the port-o-potties or something.  Yeah.  And then just unleash some in his path.  Other people are suggesting perhaps someone like No Filter Paul runs next to him in a thong  completely stealing his fire and thunder.  That would be great, but No Filter Paul could only run maybe a quarter mile.  Oh, forget about it. 
[00:36:00]  See, the bit would be to get No Filter Paul in his diapers.  Yeah.  He likes wearing diapers and have them run alongside the guy.  Oh, as he uses the diaper for what they're supposed to be used for.  That would be terrific.  Yeah, that would be great.  He could ride a bicycle next to him.  Huh?  He could ride a bike next to him.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we try to find out where this guy is and let's get some listeners on scene.  Yep.  Let's wreck this guy's day.  I just want to wreck his day.  We got Jeff in Denver.  Jeff, what's up?  Yeah, I want to light off an M80 next to the nightstand and wake up my wife. 
[00:36:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And then when she wakes up, I'm going to throw a water balloon at her.  All right.  Can we do safety first?  Yeah, it can't be...  Safety first.  How close is the nightstand, sir?  Well, it was about...  Well, that's about three foot away, but I'm going to put it on the dresser about five foot  away.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep it away because you don't want ear damage done to the lovely lady.  Yeah.  Okay, put it on there.  It's going to damage your dresser, isn't it?  Yeah, fuck it. 
[00:37:00]  I mean...  Oh, boy.  You said yeah, and then just say screw it.  Yeah, you said yeah.  That means the same thing.  Because Ann was asking if it's going to wreck the dresser.  Yeah, the dresser.  And you've got to have the phone close to your wife.  Yeah, have it close to her and not the...  Okay.  All right.  You or the M80 or anything.  Why is the left boob always a little bigger than the right boob?  I don't know.  Here we go.  We've got to talk about that later today.  Here we go.  I'm looking at pal talking.  Here we go.  Ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey.  I knew this guy was faking, by the way. 
[00:37:30]  Ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey,  keep going.  Are you done, sir?  Say he hung up on us.  I knew he was faking.  He couldn't even come up with an original idea.  It was the old explosive next to the wife gag.  Let's go to Chad in Illinois.  Chad, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, hold on.  I got something for that guy.  Ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, Howard Stern's penis.  Ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey.  All right, there you go. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  Chad, what's up?  I hope he checks out that new movie, Back to the Future, that's coming out.  That's a great movie.  I hear Michael J. Fox is in it.  Plays a kid who actually goes back in time in a DeLorean.  Look, I'm sorry that your hero went for the money instead of, you know.  Is this the song for Back to the Future?  Like he used to.  Yeah, go see this, because I hear it's just getting rave reviews.  I hope someday they make a sequel.  Yeah.  That's all I hope for.  Chad, what's going on? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, not much.  I want to wake up my driving partner right now.  Wait, hold on a minute, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.  We might have found a diarrhea truck.  Erica, New Jersey, what's up?  What's up?  How are you guys?  If you say ba-ba-booey, I'm going to have to hunt you down, because we really need the  diarrhea truck today.  Dude, seriously?  Another wake-up-your-spouse-who-gives-a-crap, but diarrhea truck, this is important today.  Yeah.  All right, what do you got, Erica?  Where is he?  I don't know where he is yet, but one of our listeners has to find him. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, this is rude.  Brad will make a right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  When does he start?  Hold your horses.  Did he start already?  I don't know.  I mean, to run 10 miles, he must have started already.  Starting line, the High Lawn Pavilion.  Brad will make a right out of High Lawn onto Eagle Rock.  I know this is very local, but someone out there will help us out, and then it'll make  sense for the rest of the country when we do something with this.  Yeah.  Then make a right onto Prospect Avenue in West Orange.  Brad will pass the Manor and Montclair Golf Club. 
[00:39:30]  Brad will make a left onto Bloomfield Avenue in Verona.  Brad will run through Verona, North Caldwell, and pass Caldwell College and Grover Cleveland  birthplace.  That should take care of the first hour or so of this, right?  Yeah.  Okay, there you go.  So that's about where he's going to be.  All right.  You got a crap truck?  I could try.  It's a little far from Jersey City, but I could try.  Like I said, I'm at the Sears Authority.  Are you drunk?  I thought you had the truck, and you were ready to roll. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, right to the second, I didn't get to work yet.  That's what I'm about to be.  People are on drugs today.  I don't get that, too, but that's not the point.  Is that what you do when you get to work?  You drive one of those trucks to clean out the outhouses?  No, I don't, actually.  I work in the office, but I can get one of my friends to do it.  Now she can't even do it.  She's got to get to work.  You get one of her friends to do it.  I understand the excitement of hearing diarrhea truck on the radio, because I kind of got a  little tingle just saying it.  Who wouldn't? 
[00:40:30]  But we actually need someone that can get this done, not someone that thinks maybe through  a friend if they decide to go to work today.  Well, yeah, I probably ain't going to work today, but I can still do it.  She's not even going to work today.  I thought it was going to be more local, though.  I'm in Jersey City.  I'm too close to you guys.  All right, Erica.  Thank you.  Thanks for nothing.  We're still in search of the diarrhea truck.  Let's say hi to Chad in Illinois.  Chad, what's up?  Not much.  How are you guys?  Pretty good.  What do you got today?  Yeah, I want to wake up my driving partner. 
[00:41:00]  He's not actually my spouse, but I think it'll work.  All right.  How are you going to do that?  I'm driving down the road right now, and I thought maybe I'd sit here and yell head  on collision and open my door and shut it and hit the rumble strip.  Oh, that's a good idea.  But isn't he?  Oh, son of a bitch.  He heard me.  Oh.  These people are so stupid.  Man, the guy's yelling.  He's like, yeah, well, my driving partner's asleep two feet away from me making this phone 
[00:41:30]  call.  And what am I about to do for you today?  Here's how I'm going to try to wake him up.  Oh, Chad, you've got to be stupider than Erica.  You guys are going to get anybody today.  I'm going to yell head on collision.  You just did.  And know what is depressing?  He came up with a very, very unique scenario.  That was a good idea.  I love the idea.  But someone that is that brilliant to come up with that is really dumb how he attempted 
[00:42:00]  to execute it.  I should have been whispering.  He was planning on doing it to me the other morning.  So that's what I was going to get even.  Well, you know what, Chad?  You gave someone an idea for next time, okay?  All right.  Sorry about that.  All right.  Well, there's Chad.  I vote him dumbest listener of the morning.  With Erica a close second.  Let's say hi to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I just drove by that guy running for the Hannah Montana ticket.  Yeah.  He's got these high-platform shoes on and this short miniskirt and long blonde hair. 
[00:42:30]  I used to dress that way.  All right.  I got drugs.  He's right on.  He said, if anybody knows the area, he's ran past the manor on Eagle Rock Road like 10  minutes ago.  Wow.  I wonder if we could, like, kidnap him or something.  The wrong man.  What if a man pulls up and we just take him hostage?  Put your Secret Service-looking guys just grab him.  Take him hostage and bring him over here. 
[00:43:00]  I'll try, man.  All right.  Wait.  So where is he?  He's on Eagle Rock Road.  He just ran past the manor.  He's going towards the golf course right now, the West Orange Golf Course.  All right.  Now we got him in our sights.  Now we just need to do something.  We need a diarrhea truck.  Where's the diarrhea truck?  Come on.  I know there's crap trucks out there that pump out the portable toilets.  You could maybe leak a little bit out. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Well, the listeners, they're very good.  So now we know where he is.  Now we just got to figure out what to do.  Yeah.  I mean, water balloons.  Can't do anything that hurts him.  Paint.  How about a super soaker filled with what you would find in a diarrhea truck?  Well, I think that's a salt.  I think that's a salt.  A super soaker is a salt?  Yeah.  Why?  Anything is a salt.  But a diarrhea truck's okay?  Well, a diarrhea truck, as long as you didn't spray it on them.  If you just happen to drop some in the road. 
[00:44:00]  Boring.  No, I want him to be a hoe.  You want him to be covered in diarrhea?  Again, I believe that would be an assault charge.  That's an easy charge, though.  Yeah.  We could do that with our eyes closed.  Well worth it.  Well worth it.  We've done way worse.  Of course we have.  All right.  What are we going to do with this guy?  He's in our sights.  Thank you, Matt.  All right.  No problem, man.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Thank you.  Howie in New York.  Boy, I wonder what this is about.  Howie, what's up?  Well, with it being Wednesday, doesn't he deserve to be wowed by one of our wonderful female listeners? 
[00:44:30]  Why would we want to do something nice for him?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah.  Well, maybe he'll get disoriented and fall off of those platform shoes.  Fell off my shoes.  What can we do with this guy?  What can we do?  I was very injured.  We just found out about this only an hour ago, so we've got to figure something out  in the next hour.  You know any, like, cops that could arrest him?  For wearing platform shoes and arrest him like a girl?  Yeah, kind of like, just hassle him a little bit.  Give him the old shakedown little. 
[00:45:00]  Pat from Monaki, he writes, I don't have a crap truck, but I do have a crappy truck.  Will that do?  How about we chomp off with his toe?  All right.  We've got lots going on.  I could vomit on him.  Drink a bunch of eggnog, Pat, and vomit on him.  Projectile vomit.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break here.  A couple things.  Let's not forget.  New website for everyone to go to, especially if you're a fan of the show Rundown.  Or if you don't even know what the show Rundown is, you should at least check it out.

[00:47:00]  $1,000 a day just for listening and listening for a dumb sound clip.  And we'll even give you the sound clip a day in advance.  Yeah.  Like we're doing today.  Yeah, you know what it is.  We're telling you right now, tomorrow, when you hear this.  I like turtles.  Sometime between 7 and 7.30, you just give us a call and you can win $1,000.  Okay?  And every day we'll have a different sound clip.  Yep.  I guess you've got to linger longer.  That's it.  Do we have a diarrhea truck on the way? 
[00:47:30]  Huh?  That'd be great.  Just soak him.  Pete, no.  You can't shoot the guy with a paintball gun.  Sorry.  No, that's illegal.  Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Hey, boy.  Yeah.  By the way, I'm going to show you how stupid.  Remember we were talking earlier how dumb our listeners are?  Yeah.  And I'm not talking about the people that already know they're not dumb, but there are people  that don't realize that they are dumb.  Yeah.  Those are the people we're talking to. 
[00:48:00]  Leave the phones alone!  Hi, who's this?  It's Luke.  Hey, Luke.  Why are you calling?  Just call and say hi.  No.  Why are you calling?  Just call.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  See, they're all listening to the radio. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  I know.  Just call them dumb soon.  I know.  I just wrecked a really good bit.  Well, we'll see.  Maybe somebody else.  The phone just went nuts.  Probably another one here.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  They're all hanging up.  They're all scared.  Well, they realized.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  I just need one person to tell us why they're calling right now.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, who's this? 
[00:49:00]  Sport.  Sport?  Why are you calling, man?  Am I the 10th caller?  For what?  For the thousand bucks.  They're all hanging up.  Yeah.  That would be starting tomorrow.  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  Gus, Buffalo.  I just want to say, did I win?  Did I win?  No.  Gus, be honest.  You thought you could win $1,000 today, right?  And then you heard me explain how stupid people are, and then you're changing your tune here. 
[00:49:30]  Wait, well, did I really win?  No.  Of course not.  How many times did we...  Hi, who's this?  This is Scott.  Hey, Scott.  What are you calling for?  I like turtles.  The phones are lit.  Yeah, they're just all lit.  The second one is hung up on, it gets filled again.  When you're doing a radio contest, you've got to make it as simple as possible, and then  when you make it as simple as possible, people still don't get it.  What about tomorrow?  They don't get the word tomorrow. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Look at these phones.  Now we can't do any radio show, because they all think they have a chance at $1,000 today.  The contest starts tomorrow.  Hey, dummies.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Between 7 and 7.30.  When you hear this...  I like turtles.  See, we...  Then you call, and then you can win $1,000.  We give you the sound in advance.  That doesn't mean we're going to play it that day, and then you're going to win.  This is for tomorrow. 
[00:50:30]  When you hear the turtle sound, tomorrow, between 7 and 7.30, then we expect to see the phones  looking exactly like they look now.  Hi.  Full.  Hi, who's this?  Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Why are you calling?  I want to know whose idea it was to play the sex pistols during the introduction two minutes ago.  What?  Huh?  Whose idea was it to play the...  Hi, who's this?  This is Matt from Jersey.  What's up, Matt? 
[00:51:00]  Nothing.  I think that this contest is BS, because I'm driving down to D.C. right now, and I'm not going  to be eligible.  For tomorrow?  Yeah, man.  I'm on a turnpike south right now.  I'm going to D.C. for a job.  Are you going to be down there for a month?  No, I'm going to be down there for only two weeks.  Yeah, see?  And how long are we doing this contest for?  Are you doing it for a whole month?  Oh, I love it.  Wow.  Hope the job interview goes better. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe they think it's an Asian girl tomorrow giving away $1,000.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah, 99X is my radio station now.  Give me my damn money.  What's 99X?  Where is 99X?  In Atlanta?  Oh, I thought this was the 99X station.  Oh, hi, who's this?  Oh, my God.  Hello, who's this? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It's hang up in shame guy.  Hi, who's this?  I just had a question.  I was just wondering about the $1,000 contest.  I live in San Diego, so am I still eligible?  Can you hear the show live?  Huh?  Can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear you.  All right.  See, if you do a little math.  See, basically, if you heard us describing, oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we've got to explain this. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  We're going to take it down a little bit for everybody.  We've got to explain time zones.  Right.  If you could hear the Opie and Anthony show, I guess you would have to hear the Opie and  Anthony show live, unless you have ESP, or you want to just take a wild guess.  Right.  Take a wild guess at when we're doing this.  I'm so glad this is happening today.  It just really shows.  This is why, for the most part, contests suck.  Because even when you make it the most easiest, we might as well, instead of playing a sound 
[00:53:00]  clip, just go, uh, 10th caller, if you call now, bro, if you can hear the show, you're  eligible.  Yeah.  You guys are great.  So now when we say between 7 and 7.30, right?  Are you still there?  I got rid of it.  Oh, because I was going to give him a little quiz.  If you're in San Diego, and we say between 7 and 7.30, we mean our time.  Our time.  Eastern time. 
[00:53:30]  That's right.  So for him, that would be between 4 and 4.30 in the morning.  4 and 4.30.  And I would imagine if you're, you have a better chance than a lot of people in San Diego,  because most people in San Diego aren't waking up at 4.  They're snoozing.  Let's try this again.  Let's say hi to this person.  Hi, who are you?  Hi, Jared, New Jersey.  All right.  Why are you calling?  I can complain.  It's a really old bit that the guy stayed once for a giveaway, 100 grand, and it turned out 
[00:54:00]  to be a candy bar.  Oh, yeah.  We can play that.  You got that, E-Rock?  Why were you really calling, though?  Because I want to hear that.  I want to hear somebody smarter than these people calling.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, A-Rock.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Mongo the Trucker.  Hey, Mongo.  Why are you calling today?  Hey, there's no candy bar named $1,000 a day.  All right.  Now I think we're just getting smartasses that called originally because they thought they 
[00:54:30]  were going to win.  They're still stupid.  Yeah.  But now they're changing what they're calling about.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hello?  All right.  Now you're right, Anthony.  Yeah.  One more.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Chris from Rhode Island.  Can I win the Donna Summers tickets?  All right.  Now they're all messing with us.  Yeah.  Very good.  Dump them.  Well, let it be noted that we were talking about a contest that starts tomorrow and the 
[00:55:00]  phones exploded because everyone thinks it's today.  Tomorrow.  And then every day that we're on the air after that for about a month, you've got a chance  to win $1,000.  They're just not going to get it.  And then I can't wait until after a month when the contest is over and we play any sound  clip between 7 and 7.30, the phones are going to light up.  And do people understand every day the sound clip is going to change?  Yeah.  Why the F are we doing this? 
[00:55:30]  So tomorrow, tomorrow when you hear this, between 7 and 7.30.  I know it's between 7 and 7.30 today.  Yeah.  But we're talking about tomorrow between 7 and 7.30.  When you hear this.  I like turtles.  All you have to do is call 877-212-ONA and you will win $1,000 if you're the 10th caller.  Now, if between 7 and 7.30, I do this.  Don't call. 
[00:56:00]  Don't call just because you heard a sound.  All right.  Why don't we make it easy for everyone?  Let's say it's 7.15 tomorrow morning.  Okay.  And I play this.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Should the listener call the Opie and Anthony show?  Don't touch the phone.  Okay.  Back away from the phone.  What if we play this?  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Okay.  You could laugh at him, but stay away from the phone. 
[00:56:30]  What if it's 7.22 tomorrow morning and you hear this?  I like turtles.  Ah, redial, redial, redial.  Gotta win.  Prize pig.  Prize pig, prize pig, prize pig.  Yeah, this is going to bring out the prize pigs.  That's for sure.  Yeah, contests always bring out the unfunny listeners.  What if I play this?  I like turtles.  At 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  7, 7.30.  Between 7 and 7.30.  Someone will have already won.  Right.  Tomorrow. 
[00:57:00]  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  Get it?  Now?  And then for Friday, I don't want to think too far in advance here.  Oh, no.  Now you're screwed.  But on Friday, we're going to have a whole different clip that you have to listen to between  7 and 7.30.  Same set of rules.  And guess what?  Tomorrow, we'll play that clip for you.  Yeah.  So you're prepared.  Oh, now I'm confused.  Dunce.  Dunces.  Here's the...  Yeah, why not?  When we were up in Boston, we gave away 100 grand. 
[00:57:30]  Check this out.  It's an ONA classic.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  107th caller.  Oh, my God.  Tell me, I won.  I won.  I don't know what.  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing.  I have this old...  Oh, I cannot... 
[00:58:00]  Jesus.  I've got to calm...  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand, bro?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying? 
[00:58:30]  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy boy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of douche.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I just hate how they have to beep it.  You guys are a bunch of douche peep.  Douche peeps.  Because God forbid you say the B word.  The B word. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, well, they took that one away from us, too.  It has nothing to do with the FCC, by the way.  Absolutely nothing.  It's stupid lawyers ruining radio.  But they get to keep their jobs after they wreck a radio show.  That's terrific.  That makes sense.  I want that back.  That makes sense.  I want you to pay them a bloody fortune to wreck radio shows, and they get to keep their  job and continue to make a bloody fortune as they throw another show in there and wonder  why that one's not working either.  I want that back.  That's my battle plan.  I want to fight to get DB back. 
[00:59:30]  Just deal with what the FCC says is acceptable and not acceptable on the radio, and leave  the rest of the crap alone.  Don't worry about it.  We're not going to use it in any context that's any different than calling somebody a name.  Right.  You were talking about contest pigs.  We've got to play the most famous contest pig that used to call a radio show back in  the day.  They don't quit either.  As long as there's a little hope that they might win something, they will stay on the 
[01:00:00]  hook.  There's a network of contest pigs out there, and now that the word's out that the Opie  and Anthony show's giving away $1,000 every day for the next four or five weeks, the contest  pigs are going to be online with each other.  Oh, my God.  Guess what?  You've got to start listening to that awful show called Opie and Anthony.  Are you getting through?  I'm getting a busy signal.  I don't listen to these guys, but I've got to win the $1,000.  I'll take their money, though, LOL. 
[01:00:30]  Spread the word.  Spread the word.  Opie and Anthony giving away $1,000 every day.  Prize pigs.  That's what they're called in the business.  They're usually fat housewives that have nothing to do, and all they do is sit around, and  they spin the radio dial, figure out which radio station's giving away what.  They make charts with the radio station.  Okay, this radio station during middays is giving away a trip to Aruba.  Okay, I've got to listen then.  Opie and Anthony are giving away $1,000 every morning between 7 and 7.30, so I've got to 
[01:01:00]  tune my dial to that station at 7.  They have multiple phones with speed dial.  Speed dial that keeps doing it.  Yeah.  Oh, they're well-known, man.  They're called contest pigs.  And we got one of these fatties on the line.  Didn't listen to our show.  No.  Had no clue about us.  Nope.  And we got her on the line, man, and I mean, we hooked her good.  Yeah.  And she thought she was calling for Donna Summer Tickets.  I love this bit.  This is one of my favorites.  And you could tell that she doesn't know who we are or listen to the show, because why 
[01:01:30]  would we be giving away Donna Summer Tickets?  Mm-hmm.  She obviously made a wrong call.  She thought she was dialing another station.  You know what's fun about doing radio in Boston?  All the radio stations, their phone numbers were very, very similar.  Yeah.  For some reason, that's how the phone company did it, I guess.  So if you're quickly dialing trying to win something, you're going to call the wrong  radio station.  The wrong radio station, and you got us.  It was all over.  I missed these, because we would get one of these almost a day.  Yep.  And we would mess with them.  Some were worth playing on the radio, and others weren't. 
[01:02:00]  This one was definitely worth playing on the radio.  This lady trying to win Donna Summer's tickets.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer Tickets.  Donna Summer Tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summer's fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a .5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row. 
[01:02:30]  What do you say?  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on.  Oh, boy.  She said that again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order. 
[01:03:00]  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what? 
[01:03:30]  Donna wants to know.  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No.  You're a big, fat virgin.  Yeah.  You're a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again.  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah, the first person in space.  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been on the space shuttle? 
[01:04:00]  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all.  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello.  Donna wants to know.  Hello.  Oh, no.  Is she hanging up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  You know why I love that?  Because she's, you know, a contest pig. 
[01:04:30]  And she wanted to believe right to the end that she was actually winning.  Yeah, all these great prizes.  Right.  You know, it was obvious that someone was goofing on her, but she didn't want to believe that  someone was goofing on her.  Yeah, don't hang up.  I might really be winning.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, I have the phrase that pays.  All right.  What's the phrase that pays?  I love Rich Foss and Tortillas.  I love Rich Foss's Tortillas.  It's Tortillas.  I've got to be honest, man. 
[01:05:00]  The listeners are really entertaining me today with their stupidity.  That was almost four years ago, and they still remember.  Tortillas?  They don't forget anything.  No.  They don't.  Hey, one of my, actually, my all-time favorite contest pig bit we did was the famous hello  bit.  Yeah.  Antoinette, I think.  Oh.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Is there any way, because there's no way we can play it on the radio anymore, because  it's like 40 minutes long.  It's so long.  The original bit, I think, was over an hour of this woman just saying hello.  That's all you heard on the radio for an hour straight was her saying hello. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, and we were talking.  Hello.  Like, I think I heard something.  Is she there?  Hello.  She's like, oh, please, I'm here.  Please.  E-Rock.  We got this new website we're promoting with the basics of the O.P. and Anthony show.  O-N-D-A radio dot com.  I'm over-pronunciating and because, you know, we're known as O-N-A as in O.  Yeah.  All right.  But that would just confuse people.  It would confuse people.  So that's why I'm emphasizing O-N-A radio dot com. 
[01:06:00]  Can we throw the Antoinette call up there?  Yeah.  We'll put it up.  Will that be easy to do later today?  I'll work with Tony.  Huh?  Yeah.  We'll get it up there.  All right.  Later today, if you haven't heard this, I love this thing.  I mean, you've got to invest about 40 minutes.  It's just 40 minutes of this lady just saying hello.  Mm-hmm.  Go to O-N-A radio dot com later this afternoon.  It should be up there.  Along with Stephen S. from Bayshore's show rundown.  By the way, I could hear it.  Two seconds. 
[01:06:30]  Just turn that off.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two seconds.  What?  Well, this is unconventional, though.  You can't just turn off mics during a live radio show.  I know.  Usually we put on some nice music.  What?  But this is probably time sensitive.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, I...  Well, I...  No, we need on-hold music.  Of course.  Oh, okay.  No way that people know not to go away.  Oh, good.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back.  You're going to do that immediately. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my goodness.  You're not serious, are you?  Well, that was because it was time sensitive. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yep.  Can you believe that?  And I'm redoing my apartment.  I know.  Well, let the speculation begin.  I like that.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Pennsylvania.  Jesse.  Do you like that song?  Yeah, what's that for?  Only Voss would...  I wasn't...  I didn't even give it a second thought.  All hell's breaking loose around us, and the only thing he could say, because he was privy  to what Anthony just said, was, I like that song.  I like that.  What's that from?  Chuck Mangione.  Chuck Mangione.  I like to call him Chuck Mangione, yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Chuck Mangione.  Was that his...  That wasn't his big hit, was it?  They all sound...  Of course they do.  Find me another Chuck Mangione song.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Pennsylvania.  Jesse?  Yo.  Hey.  I'm going to take my cat's ass, and I'm going to plant it right on my wife's face.  Did that go through, Ant?  Probably not.  But he's going to lift up his cat's tail.  Yeah, we got Jesse from Pennsylvania.  He's going to wake up his wife by using a part of the cat. 
[01:08:30]  Of the cat, yeah.  A part of the cat you would not want on your face.  A stinky part.  There you go.  Let's go, Jesse.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We haven't had a new one yet this week.  Get the phone right near her.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[01:09:00]  Why would you do that?  Say hi.  Why are you kicking me?  I can't eat you.  Go away.  Ew.  Why would you do that? 
[01:09:30]  We got another great one.  Ew.  Why would you do that?  Say hi to O and A.  No.  Fuck off.  Oh.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The old F-bomb was in order.  Whoa.  Whoa.  She just delivered the old F-bomb.  And it all started with a wedding song.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time.  I got some damage control to do.  Huh? 
[01:10:00]  I'm going to punch out.  I got some damage control to do.  You certainly do, my friend.  You know what, though?  It was worth it.  That is right up there with the M80.  That's a good one.  No, it wasn't even an M80.  The quarter stick of dynamite.  That was a good one.  I need to hear that again, Iraq.  Get that.  Ew.  Get that so we can replay that.  Hey, Jesse.  Very good.  I was scared that we weren't going to have one today.  Yeah, I tried.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That was good, because it had an ew, and then she was just, what are you doing?  Like, why would you do that? 
[01:10:30]  There's no reason to shove the cat like that in my face.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike and Paramus.  Mike, what's up?  I just drove past the Hannah Montana thing.  Yeah.  And it's just like one truck with the PLJ logo on it.  Yeah.  I got to turn around to get back to it, but do you want me to just follow them?  And then any time that they go live, I'll just lean on the horn?  Yeah, that could work.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  I mean, I'm still looking for a diarrhea truck, but in the meantime, we can do that. 
[01:11:00]  A horn will work.  Yeah, we'll do a little horn action.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Matt in White Plains before we take a break.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What the F?  What about the word tomorrow?  Do people just not understand?  What the F?  What the F?  There you go.  You're following the EROC tour.  Ah.  What the F bit?  We kind of laid off on EROC-tober.  A little bit.  We'll do a little EROC-tober today.  Yeah.  Maybe some more What the Fs and some other things. 
[01:11:30]  What the F?  That's why contests suck, Matt, because no one listens to a radio show closely, unfortunately.  I didn't call in.  People are just retarded.  We stress our asses off every day hoping that we're going to entertain our listeners, and  then you realize, if you look into this, most of them are just having on in the background.  Yeah.  You're making some poignant point, and they're just like, ah, is it time to call to win? 
[01:12:00]  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  The contest starts tomorrow.  Starting tomorrow, every day on the Opie and Anthony show, you'll have a chance to  win $1,000.  Get it in your thick head.  The contest couldn't be easier.  It's so easy.  And if it's proven that this contest isn't easy, we're just going to take the 10th caller.  Don't make us do that.  Just dial a number.  Don't even make us do that.  Oh, my God.  They're calling.  Look at the phones.  Will you stop? 
[01:12:30]  Knock it off.  We start tomorrow.  All right.  We get a little red-haired girl singing.  All right.  Rich Voss, you promoting anything?  Sitting in for Jim Norton today, no?  No.  I'm at Caroline's next weekend with Tommy Davison.  You're not going to remember that it's next.  Yeah, right.  All right.  Well.  That's what I'm trying to get at today.  Unless it's something like.  Simple.  Unless it's something like, I'm going to be at Caroline's in four hours from right now.  Yeah.  You're expecting them to remember that you're going to be there in a week?  Oh, forget it. 
[01:13:00]  Forget it.  Why do we even bother, man?  We try to give out a lot of interesting information.  It's like, my name's Opie, and I like the color blue.  There you go.  And in the mornings, I eat oatmeal.  What do you eat?  For dinner?  Right.  Wait a minute.  I didn't get the question.  I'm talking breakfast.  What do you like for breakfast? 
[01:13:30]  Uh, lunch?  Like, why bother?  Really?  Yeah.  Dummies.  Try to talk about the news.  They don't even know what planet they're on.  When you do contests like this, it just, it proves it.  You're going to be radio hosts and teachers at the same time.  Rich, you think I'm kidding?  I'm looking at it.  The phones.  The phones just won't stop.  They really think they have a chance to win today.  It's tomorrow.  My God.  My God.  Did anybody win the contest yesterday? 
[01:14:00]  I was going to get a call tomorrow.  Oh, Brooklyn Ace.  I know he's joking because he's not dumb.  Brooklyn Ace.  Opie played the sound clip.  Do I win?  See, I like Brooklyn Ace.  He's a faithful listener.  He gets it.  Thank you, Brooklyn Ace.  Later, boys.  All right.  It's unbelievable, though.  No joke.  The phones are ringing off the hook.  We can't answer them fast enough.  Tomorrow, the contest starts.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Even Jay Leno got it wrong the other night.  Opie-ny.  From the Opie and Andy show.  Opie and Andy.  Jesus.  Opie and Anthony.  A-N-T-H-O-N-Y.  And we'll be right back after these messages.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:15:00]  Here's the latest patch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  I want to tell my fucking boss he can fucking suck my cock.  He's a fucking piece of shit.  Four foot tall.  Fucking turdmonger.  That fucking beats shit for a fucking living.  Fuck you!  Next message.  Yeah, this message I want to say is to my brother.

[01:16:30]  I hope you die in a drive-by.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.

Cell phone and media users send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com. 
[01:17:00]  Everything is happening now.  O.P. and Anthony has it for you.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  Radio shop job.  O.P. and Anthony.  F the devils.  Yuck.  O.P. Anthony.  Phone number, 877-212-ONA.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  We're also promoting a new website that just has the O.P. and Anthony basics. 
[01:17:30]  Making it hopefully easier for the listeners to follow along with this show.  That's what we're learning today, aren't we?  Aren't we learning?  They need it.  And we need to just give them the basics.  So we got the website onaradio.com with basic videos, basic info, Stephen S. from Bayshore's  show rundown, which is very terrific.  And in the show rundown, he gives you all the videos and links of things we talk about on the show. 
[01:18:00]  So hopefully that'll make it easier for people.  You know?  Well, maybe we'll even have the contest rules for this $1,000 a day giveaway we're starting  tomorrow.  Wow.  Reading.  So you go there, and if you have any questions about probably the easiest radio contest ever,  you can figure it out by going to that website.  Easy.  Oh, my God.  What else is going on?  We got Keeper Sutherland going to jail for 48 days.  They're pretty, uh, they're getting real strict with these celebrities and jailing them for 
[01:18:30]  the deweys.  It used to be nothing.  Celebrities would get deweys all the time.  Regular civvies would get deweys, and you really had to screw up to see any jail time from  a dewey.  You either had to hit and run, or, uh, like multiple, and I don't mean two, I mean, you  know, five, six of them.  Now they're not screwing around.  No.  They throw you right in the, uh, the old clink. 
[01:19:00]  You know he'll break out, though.  Oh, well, yes.  Travis, who's just a huge 24 fan.  Is he?  Yes, he is.  He's, uh, convinced that, uh, he'll break out of prison if he's needed.  And I just, uh, had to give him the brutal truth that he'll probably get raped in prison.  And, uh, you'll never look at him the same way again.  He's going to wear a, uh, Donald Sutherland mask as he does it.  Yeah.  Like it's his old man.  But wait a second. 
[01:19:30]  Here's the thing.  Uh, like the one girl went to jail for a day.  How about you put headphones on?  Oh.  Yeah.  Because it hurts my ears.  Uh, went to jail for one day.  Okay, how many times was he drunk driving to go for 48 days?  I mean, like you said, five times when we grew up.  Well, yeah.  If you follow the story, uh, he's been a bad boy on numerous occasions.  Yeah.  They're finally slapping him.  But, uh, what kind of arrests has he had?  I, I thought it was only two Deweys.  Not only, but.  I thought it was three. 
[01:20:00]  I thought this was the third.  Yeah.  Uh, well, Travis.  Here's the Kiefer Sutherland expert.  The expert.  And he likes Kiefer's feet.  And also the last fan of, uh, 24 still watching.  Yeah.  I gave up on that show after the first season.  I thought the first season was terrific.  It was, it was my favorite show back in the day, but I didn't need to go back for a second  season.  What's the, what's the title, the IQ, the people that watch it still?  What?  So, uh, what, what is going on with, uh, Jack Bauer? 
[01:20:30]  No, I think, I think you're right.  He's only been arrested like twice, but this one violated his probation.  Ah.  From the last one.  Yeah.  But he also, hold on.  He also tackled a Christmas tree.  Oh, yeah.  And he tackled his action figure.  Burned his action figure.  He tackled the Christmas tree.  What else did he do?  There was a picture that I found last week where he's just sitting in a bar with no pants  on for some reason.  I'm just going to say, I'm just going to take my pants off.  Numerous offenses of being a dope. 
[01:21:00]  You know, he's probably just one of those real bad drunks that there are drunks that  are just really bad at it.  Cause he'll, if you're taking your pants off to sit in the chair at a bar and just sit  there with your pants off, you don't know what you're doing.  You know, here's the thing, you're so, alcohol, like you could be so rich and so famous, but  the disease of alcoholism is not prejudice.  From Park Avenue to Park Bench.  That's what they say.  Oh, look at him.  From, from, from you. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  From you.  Get off, get off your 12th step.  He is one of the most famous people in the world.  He's got more money, but yet he's got to fight that disease of addiction.  Maybe it's not a disease.  Maybe he's just, when he drinks, he's an ass.  That's the disease.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tackling a Christmas tree and burning your own action figure.  You know how long it takes to get an action figure.  Yeah.  It was the prototype too.  So they had to go back and actually make it all over again. 
[01:22:00]  Delated by a year.  They gave him the prototype of the action figure and he burnt it.  They should just put it out as a burn.  Yeah.  Just a burnt up Jack Bauer.  But show me, show me someone that gets drunk and does normal stuff though, Rich.  Yeah.  Show me a guy that gets really drunk and decides he needs to do algebra.  It's not like every day the guy was getting arrested.  When you get drunk, you do stupid things.  You're saying it's not every day he got arrested.  The days he, that's the days he got caught.  But the other days he didn't get, maybe he was fine. 
[01:22:30]  What are his odds that he only drinks, the days he only drinks, he gets arrested.  So you know he's drinking every other day too.  Let me tell you something.  When I get hammered, I get really hammered.  I'm a happy, fun drunk.  You might even get so drunk you'll ask a 17-year-old girl for her phone number.  When was that?  My daughter.  Oh, when I was trying to pick up Rich's daughter.  That was more to annoy you than to actually get your daughter's phone number.  Although I must say, it wasn't totally just to get it at you. 
[01:23:00]  His daughters are very cute.  It got a bit creepy.  That was after the PNC show, right?  I felt so dirty.  I had to go to some type of center and just talk to people.  I think your daughters liked me.  They liked you?  That's what most alcoholics do when they're drunk.  He got out.  And was trying to get them to go on a shopping spree and on vacation with them.  I was like, come on, I'll take you shopping.  And there was a-  Ava Braun outfit.  And part of it was dead serious. 
[01:23:30]  And the best part about that, Rich Voss was sitting next to me.  And he was trying to figure out where his position would be in the Opie and Anthony show  if he punched Anthony in the face.  Oh, yeah.  And Ant knew that.  So Ant was pushing further and further, trying to get phone numbers.  It was so to get Rich pissed.  Voss was just-  Livid.  Hot under the collar.  He was livid.  And it was really interesting to see how far Anthony could take it before Rich would actually  do what he was supposed to do and be a father, but he decided-  Punched me in the head.  But he decided his exposure on the Opie and Anthony show is much more important than the 
[01:24:00]  welfare of his two hot daughters.  First of all, I-  So he did nothing.  You're 100% wrong.  I walked over to my daughter and I ripped up some papers and I said, don't talk to him  again.  All right?  Because I can't change how he acts.  I can only change how my daughter reacts.  Okay?  So I did do what a parent was supposed to do.  All right?  I can't go after every perp on this planet.  All right?  All I can do is perp or perv?  Perp.  Perpetrator.  Okay?  I grew up in the streets. 
[01:24:30]  It's called perpetrator.  I would say perv.  Or perv.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I did-  Hot young daughters.  I'm thinking perv.  Like you went on your daughter privy to the cumi of fortune?  First of all, that fortune hasn't left the house.  Okay?  What's she going to do?  Get video games?  Yes.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  She's very young.  She probably enjoys them.  She wouldn't even let her sit on the couch.  Yeah.  All right.  As long as she doesn't pick her nose and wipe it in my cushions.  She's that age.  All right.  Well, so Kiefer's going away for 48 days. 
[01:25:00]  I got a lead belly yelling at me saying 24 is a great show.  I loved it.  The first season I loved.  I couldn't be bothered with the second season.  How long is he going?  48.  Oh, 48.  Yeah.  I thought if they sent him for 24 days, it would have been like a kind of tie-in for  the show.  I think the judge wasn't brave enough, but you know, 48 is not, is two 24s.  Two 24s.  Which is very nice.  That's a long time.  Wait, let me explain to the dummies out there.  Yeah.  See, if you take two and you times it by 24, the name of Kiefer Sutherland's hit TV show, 
[01:25:30]  that's 48.  Yeah.  He's going to jail for 48 days.  That would be two seasons of 24.  Dude, that is a long time to be in jail, especially if you're a celebrity.  It would be 48 seasons of 24, because 24 is a one-day season.  It would be 48 seasons.  Oh, boy.  Do you understand?  Could you call in with that, Rich?  No, he's not going to jail for 48 hours, which would be two seasons. 
[01:26:00]  He's going for 48 days, which is 48 seasons.  We mean real days, though.  He's probably right.  Yeah, I know.  Probably I'm right.  It worked how I said it, though, too.  And it's weeks.  But you're kind of right, I guess.  It's on once a week.  It kind of sucks when you have something on me, finally, after eight years.  Wow.  One for you.  2,842 for me.  Oh, okay, sore loser.  Jesus.  Sorry.  I wanted a perfect record. 
[01:26:30]  I couldn't take it in jail for, like, a day.  I could probably go a day.  Like, you know, the voyeur bus people, when they all got arrested, a little over a day.  That I could probably take.  But if they told me, like, you're going away for, like, 50 days, or that would really get me.  I can't imagine years where they say 10 to 15 years.  What would get to you, though?  The thought that you're locked up in prison for that amount of time. 
[01:27:00]  And 50 days in jail.  But what would be the thing that got you?  The being, yeah, maybe the rape.  Right.  No, just the being confined like that, and then being with nasty elements, constantly having to be on your guard.  Wait a minute.  This is like how I am at home.  What would it be?  Constantly on my guard.  I'm confined.  What would it be?  I just don't have any nasty elements.  Would it be the germs that get to you?  No, no, not at all. 
[01:27:30]  I don't care about the germs or anything.  The horrible sleeping conditions?  No, no, even that.  What if you're in a cell by yourself for 50 days?  Easier?  That would be easier, yes.  Obviously.  Easier.  I would want to be, like, in isolation.  Leave me completely alone 50 days.  I'd be fine in isolation.  Believe me, I would probably be completely fine in solitary confinement for, like, an entire stretch.  I've got a great imagination.  I'll just sit there and go somewhere else. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  In my head.  Would you be more scared of getting beat up or getting raped?  What would you be more scared of?  What the hell do you think?  A black eye?  You can walk around in the cafeteria and just take a seat.  The other thing, you can't even take a seat.  You're just kind of, you're sitting on the edge of the bench.  When you walk in, you're like, oh, timid.  Someone thinks you sat in Jell-O.  I was reading on one of the prison websites.  You go to prison websites?  Why?  Why do you go to prison websites?  Oh, damn. 
[01:28:30]  There's stories, rape stories, and stuff on prison websites.  Why?  Hold on.  Wow.  No, no.  You can't just casually go, oh, that's like saying I was, oh, I went to eBay and prison  website.  Yeah.  Someone told me about this link about prison something.  I don't know what it is, but it tells you all these prison stories about guys.  One of your fetishes is prison rape stories, right?  Yeah.  Prisons, when you drive past a prison, you got to stop and look.  They're like the creepiest, most mysterious.  Oh, yeah.  You do look at the barbed wire in the yard and go like, wow, man, that's the real deal. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know a person a lot that wouldn't take a look as they're driving by a prison,  but you went from that to you're hanging out on prison websites reading rape stories.  Reading rape stories.  That's a little different than, hey, honey, wow, look, that's Rikers.  So what was the hottest one you read, Rich?  Well, what they did say is which one really got you off story about man-on-man action in  the shower.  One guy said when you go in, if you're going to be a punk, just pick one guy and take 
[01:29:30]  care of that one guy so they don't all get and hope it's that old gag.  I guess the people in prison haven't figured that one out yet.  Yeah.  I like the old gag.  Yeah.  Dude, here's what you got to do.  You find the biggest guy in prison.  You walk up to him and just punch him in the face.  Yeah, that's not going to give you a...  You'll get killed.  And you'll absolutely get killed in a second.  Because first of all, your punch probably ain't going to do anything to this huge prison  guy. 
[01:30:00]  And even if you think it's just going to...  They're going to laugh at you like, oh God, another dope that believes in that old wise  tale.  All right, I'm here.  I just want everybody to realize I'm in this jerk now.  That's me screaming.  Get grabbed by the throat.  There you go.  Yeah, you think you're so tough.  You think...  What?  What?  Why isn't he falling down?  This is the biggest guy... 
[01:30:30]  Okay.  Get off my foot!  I'm sorry I hit you.  What?  Tonight?  Be in the laundry room?  Would you go 50 days without taking a shower?  See, that's another thing.  I don't shower in front of guys.  Never have.  All through school, gym class, all that crap where the gym teacher was always a little 
[01:31:00]  too enthusiastic.  It's like, what are you doing?  You're not showering, Cumia?  Don't you understand?  You got to go to class the rest of the day.  It's like, I didn't work up a sweat in gym class.  I didn't do anything in gym class.  So why do I have to shower?  And this gym teacher would love all his jocks getting in this steamy shower.  And he'd look in and go, how are you guys doing in there?  He's like, what the?  How are they doing?  We're not doing...  And he'd help with their back.  Hey, coach, could you help me with my back?  We're not doing well, coach.  Like, who gives a crap if you're a little smelly during history class? 
[01:31:30]  It's worth it.  I'd go 50 days probably washing my face.  Do they give you those paper towels to rip your skin off you when you dry?  I can only imagine they're not comfy towels in prison.  Dude, I was an athlete growing up, and I developed way late.  It's mortifying.  I'm still waiting to do that.  It's mortifying to be in that situation.  You're just trying to hide what little you got.  There was a kid in school. 
[01:32:00]  Then you got, like, the star quarterback that was shaving since he was 12.  Right next to you, you're just like, oh, God.  He's a complete man.  Why do I have to be in this situation?  There was some kid in school that...  Not a hint of a hair on my body yet.  He hadn't grown up.  And I'm showering next to a gorilla.  Just so I don't smell in history class.  Great.  Thanks, coach.  He loved to shower after gym class.  And this kid hadn't, like, grown up. 
[01:32:30]  But he liked to, you know, take showers after gym class.  And everyone made fun of him.  Because it was like he was a second grader.  And, you know, we were in seventh grade, I guess.  Something like that.  And he would walk into the shower, and everybody's just like, oh, Jesus, look.  Laughing.  It's probably in porno now.  This looks like a little half a thumb.  It was just...  It was the worst.  I was that guy.  My whole life, I thought I had a, you know, I was, you know, I had a, you know. 
[01:33:00]  Thought you were doing all right.  But then finally, you know, puberty hit.  And the first time a woman told me that, I was like, really?  I had no idea.  Because my whole life, I, you know.  Was mocked.  Yeah, well, we'll talk about this at 9 o'clock.  It wasn't that I was mocked.  It wasn't like I was, like, prancing around showing off what I had.  But I just knew.  I was, I looked like, yeah, like you didn't, like it was plywood. 
[01:33:30]  And, but I remember this kid, Arthur.  He was worse.  And when they would pick on me, I would point to Arthur and take the attention off.  Oh, good.  I'd go, what about Arthur?  He works.  I would just, I would just find the shower all the way in the corner.  Wouldn't shower.  I would get the strategic shower.  Wouldn't shower.  That had to be in the corner.  Because then you could, like, just face the corner with your nothingness.  And if I was in prison?  In prison, like you walk in.  Wouldn't shower.  Like, it's tough enough to fight with clothes on.  Yeah.  How are you going to fight with no clothes on? 
[01:34:00]  No clothes on.  You're just completely vulnerable to anything that can punch you there.  Right.  An uppercut to that area.  You're done.  They could just do whatever they want.  What is the website where you get your hot prison stories from?  Your hot prison stories, Rich.  I don't know.  Can you remember?  And we'll give the website out after the break?  No.  Prison stories.  Prisonstories.com.  Yeah, it was prisonstories.com.  And you really get into these, huh?  A-Rock, look at that website and give us a good one for after the break. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, we need a good story.  Before we go to break, we've got to remind you about this.  Oh, God.  Look at this.  Just the front page.  It's some guy that looks like he's nude, handcuffed.  Jesus, Rich.  What are you doing, Rich?  Why would you go there?  I understand all of a sudden, like, could you get tired of reading a whack bag and you  just go there?  Well, going from whack bag to this is kind of a big jump.  Yeah.  This is a jump over a river. 
[01:35:00]  It was my first day.  I thought everything would go okay.  I met someone on the bus.  I was in the laundry room.  He seemed like a big enough guy that could take care of himself.  I thought we were friends.  Well, when we met in the laundry room...  All right, listen.  We're running late.  Oh, we'll continue.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to try to pick the story Rich found the hottest.  Yeah.  Tell us which one you found really hot, okay?  And don't lie. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, no.  Is it when one of the lousy screws were transferring an inmate to another cell and took a little detour?  Yeah, before we go to break, you know, people got crap lying around.  Yeah.  But they also have, like, gold and jewelry.  You can get money for your unwanted gold or jewelry.  Yes.  Just for going to cash4gold.com.  Cash, the number 4, gold.com.

On the way, a hot story from prisonstories.com, courtesy of Rich Voss.  Also, we got to replay the wake-up call we got today.  It was terrific. 
[01:36:30]  That was a fun one.  It was a lot of fun.  We want to replay that.  That was the only one we got today.  But it was a real good one.  Yeah.  In case you missed it, we're going to explain how we're giving away $1,000 a day for the  next four or five weeks after the break.  And also, your morning show, Bit of the Day, or Bit of the Week, or whatever.  We're going to do the diet wrap next.  Ooh.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony, and this is what you need to know. 
[01:37:00]  We're looking for a really hot prison rape story.  In honor of Rich Voss sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Hopefully, we'll have that on the radio in 15, 20 minutes.  We got a new website that has the O&A basics on it.  It's called onaradio.com.  That'll have the show run down, which is unbelievable.  I love the show run down.  Really, really like it a lot.  And Stephen S. from Bayshore is writing it these days and doing a great job.  It also has the phone numbers and just basic stuff that have something to do with this radio show. 
[01:37:30]  So make sure you check that out.  Whip Him Out Wednesday is going very well today.  Thank you to all the ladies that are wowing on Pal Talk.  And we're getting some phone calls from, you know, the roadways that women are out there doing that.  So thank you for keeping that alive.  Yeah.  Also, this is where it gets a little complicated.  Starting tomorrow.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Starting tomorrow. 
[01:38:00]  We're going to start giving away $1,000 a day just for listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  So call in now.  Starting tomorrow.  Okay.  And every day, starting tomorrow.

[01:38:30]  Think bullet points.  $1,000 a day between 7 and 7.30.  Listening to Opie and Anthony.  Right.  So far, so good.  We're going to play a sound clip.  Sound clip.  Tomorrow's sound clip is going to be this.  I like turtles.  When you hear that tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Between 7 and 7.30.  We're just going to play that.  If you're the 10th caller at 877-212-ONA, you're going to win $1,000. 
[01:39:00]  So every day, the day before, you'll play the clip.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Rich.  I'm not blaming you.  Yes.  No, I'm letting them know.  You're absolutely right, but I don't even want to tell them that much yet.  It's a reasonable question.  Because look at the phones.  They're ringing right now.  If they call in, they can win $1,000 tomorrow.  Starting tomorrow, but they're calling today.  This is amazing.  I've been doing radio since I was 18, and this never ceases to amaze me,  how dumb people are that listen to a radio show.  Not you. 
[01:39:30]  You already know.  And I mean the person that's listening, going, look, I'm not dumb.  I know you're not dumb.  We know that.  But there are a lot of people calling our show right now, thinking that we're giving  away $1,000 right now.  No, starting tomorrow.  When you hear.  I like turtles.  Tomorrow.  Between 7 and 7.30.  You're going to win $1,000 if you're the 10th caller.  And then tomorrow, we're going to play another sound clip that you have to listen to for  Friday's $1,000.  And it's just going to continue that way, okay?  But the first clip you need to know is this.  I like turtles. 
[01:40:00]  You hear that between 7 and 7.30?  $1,000.  10th caller.  You think those are callers?  Between 7 and 7.30.  7 and 7.30.  Tomorrow.  One of those callers are trying to win right now?  Yes.  Somebody is that stupid.  Yes.  Wow.  Look at that.  That looks like a pinball machine.  Hi, who's this?  Well, look, I'm not dumb.  I know you guys.  Hi, who's this?  Allison from New Jersey.  Hey, Allison.  Why are you calling?  Well, I think since people are so stupid and can't get this contest, you should just give 
[01:40:30]  like $5,000 to me to get a boob job and $2,000 to Andrew from Brooklyn for his Spatial  Endeavors.  Spatial Endeavors.  Spatial Endeavor.  You need $5,000 for a boob job?  Yeah, I want to get a boob job.  How old are you?  I'm giving out to morons.  19.  Well, maybe I'll keep growing.  Why don't you give it another couple years?  Nah, 19.  It's over, Johnny.  I don't want to wait.  And what do you got?  What are you sporting?  Bees.  Well, come on.  We should go a little bit bigger. 
[01:41:00]  You got bees?  Why do you need the boobs?  I don't know.  Why not?  Is your face pretty?  But I mean, are you looking to go into the stripper field?  No, I don't think so.  Who told you you have awful small boobs?  Because small boobs could be very nice.  I like them.  Yeah, but I've got a big butt.  So we can't do a big butt and no boobs.  It's got to be...  Big mouth, too. 
[01:41:30]  Big butt, click.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thanks for getting it.  Couldn't hang up fast enough.  Look, us guys can deal with the small boobs.  It's the big butt we have a problem with.  Unless you're a brother.  I get it.  The brothers love the big butt.  Patrice, man, walking on the streets with him yesterday, every girl that had a massive  butt, he was drooling over. 
[01:42:00]  I don't get that.  Neither do I.  There's nothing I could do with that either.  Just...  Oh, okay.  Well, they picked out a hot prison rape story.  Oh.  But it's not FM friendly.  No?  Well, maybe we'll have to...  What if we, like, substitute a word or something?  Yeah, we'll have to do that.  All right.  Give me a word.  That's innocent enough.  Turtles?  Look at this guy.  One of the times I was, uh... 
[01:42:30]  I got no help afterwards.  A fellow inmate came up to me in the shower and told me to...  His turtle.  And when I said no, he punched me in the gut and made me get down on my...  Knees and give him...  It was very degrading, and when I told the proper authorities at the prison, they told  me not to be a tattletale.  And then it got back to the inmate that I told, and he stabbed me and said, if I make 
[01:43:00]  eye contact with him again, he would kill me the first chance he got.  It was so scary getting a death threat by someone who was really serious about it.  I'm going to die soon, and there's no way getting around it.  I don't think I'll ever see the light of day again.  I will die in prison, and I'm sure of it.  This is the crap you're reading, Rich?  Here's the thing.  No, it's great about this story.  He goes, I was scared of getting a death threat, but you already got stabbed.  The stabbing?  Oh, man.  Okay, hey, don't worry about the stabbing, but please don't threaten to kill me. 
[01:43:30]  Can we get another hot rape story?  Prison rape story in honor of Rich Voss?  Look at him.  Huh?  How could he not get...  Look at this guy.  This guy would get raped at the library.  You know what I mean?  Why would he get raped at the library?  The nicest...  Or the library.  How'd you say it?  Library.  They told him not to be a tattletale.  He was making fun of you.  How did he say it?  Library.  Library.  The library.  And not to be a tattletale.  You don't snitch in prison.  That's the first thing. 
[01:44:00]  Snitches get...  Stitches.  Snitches, you idiot.  Oh, my God.  Snitches get stitches right there.  Okay, good.  Where you gotta lay on your belly for a while.  It's stitches.  Okay.  Snitches get stitches.  Huh?  Well, they get the stitches because they got the shank.  They got shanked.  Okay.  But the saying's been around forever that snitches get...  And you answered shanked.  Okay, because...  All right.  I don't want to play a rhyme game.  That might be the next contest. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, because I'm the only one that knew that.  Okay.  I never heard that.  There's probably one other dummy out there.  This was from Rikers, so he's a local guy if you want to look him up.  Yeah, Rich.  Rich.  Maybe he could hang outside the prison and hope to be noticed.  Maybe he could wear your short shorts.  He could give you a little more detail about what happened in the shower.  Maybe he'll give you a little extra if you wear those short shorts like you used to back in the day.  Look at his mouth, though.  I mean, come on.  That's the kind of mouth you...  All right, guys.  First of all, this guy's nothing but a creep. 
[01:45:00]  I know.  Yeah.  All right, we got to do more to show a bit of the day.  As we get more of those hot prison rape stories.  But before we do that, it's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We got a great one that came in about an hour ago.  Want to replay it today because it's slow.  It's slow today as far as waking up your roommate or spouse or husband, wife, whatever.  But this one came in.  It was terrific.  Yeah, we got Jesse from Pennsylvania.  He's going to wake up his wife by using a part of the cat.  Of the cat, yeah.  A part of the cat you would not want on your face. 
[01:45:30]  A stinky part.  There you go.  Let's go, Jesse.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We haven't had a new one yet this week.  Get the phone right near her.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Why would you do that?  Say hi. 
[01:46:00]  Why are you kicking me?  I f***ing eat you.  I f***ing eat you.  Go away.  Ew.  Why would you do that?  We got another great one.  Ew.  Why would you do that?  Say hi to O and A.  No?  Yeah.  And there you have it. 
[01:46:30]  Today's Wake Up Your Spouse.  God, that was a good one.  And there was a guy that was going to do a great one, but he woke up the person ahead  of time by accident.  The guy that was sleeping right next to him as they were commuting to work.  You want another hot prison rape story there, Rich?  These are great stories.  I mean, it just makes you feel like you're there.  Well, why would you go to the website and read these things?  Yeah, I don't understand why you would go there. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, I see a lot of highlight on this one.  Oh, boy.  You ready, Rich?  All right.  Just for you, buddy.  Let me get my beep ready.  Predators in prison are after more than just money.  It satisfies some of their needs, but not all.  When an inmate has a lot of time behind them, the need for sexual release and satisfaction  becomes unbearable.  Traditional methods of self-whatever no longer are enough.  Engaging in a sexual act is a violation of prison rules. 
[01:47:30]  But even the most gung-ho officer realized the need for gratification and the need to keep  the peace.  This is not being said that they condone it, but they might not make a serious effort  to catch inmates doing it.  The involved inmates don't want to get caught, which may result in separation from one another.  They will always do it at a time when they know that the officers are occupied with another  duty, and they will usually post a sentry to watch for the officer.  This person is called a hawk or a jigger. 
[01:48:00]  A hawk or a jigger is what they call these predators?  No, it's the lookout.  The lookout.  Oh, the lookout.  Well, yeah, you got to have vision like a hawk.  Yeah, they are often paid in some way for this service.  The act of watching and warning is called hawking the man.  How do you get that job as a hawk in prison?  I don't know, Rich.  Why, you want it?  Well, instead of getting ready, hey, I'll be your lookout.  It does sound like a sexy job.  You get a little cash and you get to see some cool stuff, huh, Rich?  Well, no, you just keep lookout. 
[01:48:30]  I just want to say, guys, before you rate me, I have great eyes and I can see the flat foot  coming flat foot.  Oh, you call him flat foot?  Yeah.  All right.  Obviously, my advice to the average inmate is to avoid the daddies, the punks, and the  homosexuals altogether.  Avoidance is not all there is to it.  A sexual predator will always victimize the weak.  A person who puts up a ferocious fight every time he is threatened is not a good prospect. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  So you got to like just duke it out no matter how bad you get beat.  So in this, in your case, Rich, you got to fight like and make believe you're really  not into what's going on.  A person who appears to have loyal friends that stick together consistently is also a  poor prospect.  Going to prison officials for protection should be considered based on the attitude and  philosophies of that particular prison.  While working at a maximum custody prison, I heard a correctional lieutenant tell an inmate  who asked for protection, you have two choices. 
[01:49:30]  Get on your knees or jump the fence because we are not going to protect you.  The inmate didn't jump the fence.  Oh, boy.  I guess he did the first option.  Yeah.  Prison officials take this type of attitude only when the administration allows it.  I would say that this attitude is the exception and not the rule in today's prisons.  After all, correctional officers are sworn to protect inmates.  It should also be noted that sexual transmitted diseases are of real consideration for inmates.  Blah, blahs are sometimes allowed in prison, but not always.  That would be protection from diseases. 
[01:50:00]  If an inmate was to contract AIDS after being turned out, he might consider it poetic justice  to spread it around.  Most prison medical departments are prohibited from making a public knowledge that an inmate  is HIV positive.  However, the good ones will drop a hint of some kind to correctional staff.  The inmates seldom become aware of it, though.  That's not a good...  More informational than hot and sexy.  Rich is looking for hot and sexy.  Rich is all bored with that one. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, let's...  Oh, he's coming right back in.  All right, let's go to Harry in Memphis.  Do you guys watch Lockdown?  Tell us about the discount, Harry!  What's up, Harry?  Morning, boys.  Linger longer.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, I got a good one for you.  I had to do a 15-year bid in Ohio, and I was coming in off the yard one day, and an inmate  asked me to get this extremely large black dude out of his cell.  So I said, okay, I'll go in and get him.  So as I go up to knock on the door, I look in the window, and he's just giving it to this 
[01:51:00]  little old white guy.  Well, I turn around to walk off, and I hear this god-awful scream.  So I thought that something bad had just happened, and when I turn around and look back in the  cell, it did.  The little white dude had pooped all over the black dude.  Well, I don't think that made it through.  I doubt that made it through, but...  You wanted to have it for 15 years?  I was sentenced 15 years, and I only ended up doing five. 
[01:51:30]  Five?  Were you like...  Well, the grand finale of your story didn't make the radio, unfortunately, but...  No.  But let's just say the perpetrator, the rapist...  Yeah.  ...got, because of, I guess, the guy that he was doing this to, got a little nervous during  this, to say the least, that he left him his just desserts, let's say.  Yeah.  He made a mess of the joint.  Aren't white dudes supposed to stick up? 
[01:52:00]  Isn't a black guy not allowed to do that to a white guy in prison?  Well, yeah, there's rules, Rich.  Rich, why don't you go into a prison and do an X-Men A?  No, I'm asking you.  You can wear your short shorts and write a tell-all book of what happens in prison.  Isn't that true, that, like, he's not allowed to do that without permission or something  from, like, the white gangs or the Brotherhood or something, right?  It's not like that at all.  I mean, prison ain't what everybody says it is.  I mean, it's like a big club that's fenced in. 
[01:52:30]  It's like a big college campus.  You come and go as you please.  You just have to be in your cell account time.  And if that's your preference, that's your preference.  I mean, whites, blacks, they basically bang anybody they want.  I would ask boom, boom, or yum, yum.  Boom, boom, or yum, yum.  That's what I would say.  Boom, boom, or yum, yum.  All right, Harry, thank you.  All right, bud.  Yep.  What was I going to say?  Yeah, I know.  It's century.  Wait, century.  It's century. 
[01:53:00]  It's kind of similar, though, isn't it?  Someone's making fun of me because I said...  A century?  Century.  Century instead of century.  I didn't even notice.  I was waiting for the hot, sexy parts.  Look, I know.  I never materialized.  My reading leaves a bit to be desired there, but that's a close one.  Come on.  I don't mind when someone asks you some other words.  S-E-N-T-R-Y.  Yeah.  I made it sound like century.  Century.  The 20th century.  It's real close, isn't it?  The 20th century.  How would you say century?  S-E-N-T-R-Y.  I would say, yeah, a guard is a century, and then a hundred years is a century. 
[01:53:30]  It's really close.  It is close.  But if you're English, it's century.  Century?  That's a hundred years is a century.  Which sounds?  Yes, a century.  Just like the other.  But they also say aluminum.  Hey, you want to read...  Which is stupid.  I don't know if we can read this one.  This one's way too hot.  Oh, okay.  I get the beep, finally.  Do you want to read this one, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Please.  Please.  Let me read it.  Ah. 
[01:54:00]  Wow.  Yeah, we got to change some words, though, man.  Yeah?  Can't just beep it?  All right.  Get ready with the beep.  All right.  When an inmate is forcibly...  ...by a group of men, usually another uninvolved inmate will offer the...  ...inmate protection from gang...  ...but it carries a price.  The inmate must now have...  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me get my script.  Oh, okay.  So I can read along.  The inmate... 
[01:54:30]  Can't you, like, be a little more creative with the beeps, by the way?  I was trying, but I didn't have the things.  Yeah.  I'm not simply...  ...involved inmate will offer the...  ...inmate protection from gang...  ...but...  ...okay, okay.  There you go.  I'm reading now.  All right.  But it carries a price.  The inmate must now have...  ...with the protector.  As bad as this sounds, it's better than being...  ...the inmate has the option of checking off.  That is, asking prison staff for protection.  This, too, carries a price.  Prison officials often ask the inmate to identify and testify against his attackers. 
[01:55:00]  At this point, the inmate is labeled a snitch, and his life is in further danger.  This situation requires that the inmate be segregated for protection or moved repeatedly to other prisons farther and farther from home.  The inmates have a communication system that is unbelievable, so sooner or later, the inmate will be found out.  As a result, the inmate sometimes chooses the protection route.  The inmate providing the protection is called the daddy, and the protected inmate is called a punk or a blank boy. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, sorry.  A boy.  It would actually, if you wanted to say that clean, you could call him a rooster boy.  A rooster boy.  The daddy may even fall in love with the punk, or he may grow tired of him and sell him or trade him to another inmate.  He may even rent his services out to others for free.  Oof.  For a fee, I mean.  Because an inmate has s*** with another of the same s***, he is not necessarily a homosexual, although he may begin to enjoy it and become one.  This procedure is called being turned out. 
[01:56:00]  It is my belief that to be turned out, the individual already had some homosexual tendencies prior to being subjected to this situation.  Another method of obtaining a s*** is through seduction.  It is not unlike a person seducing one of the opposite sex.  The inmate is friendly, attentive, and protective over his victim.  It may take months to get the victim to succumb.  However, when it is done voluntarily, and not by force, or rear it to act into actually falling in love. 
[01:56:30]  What?  Well, yeah, they kind of just fall in love, I guess.  That's what I mean.  What?  Sweet story.  For this reason, it is never wise for an inmate to ridicule or pick on these individuals because they are protected by a strong alliance.  A man can lose all control when someone does something to his family.  It is the same situation when two inmates are in love.  Prison officials will often arrange for two lovers to be housed together just to keep the peace. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  True.  Lucky them.  Almost.  You usually have a field day in prison.  After all, they are as close to a real woman that the inmates will have access to.  The fact that they want to be female and are willing to act the part is very exciting to the inmates.  When a new b***h comes into prison, there is often a power struggle that can result in violence to determine who gets him.  Being a homo-sector in prison usually is protection in itself. 
[01:57:30]  The inmates view them as a woman and treat them as such.  When I search homo-sector's lager, I almost find that it is full of goodies from the prison store, although they are not seen there.  Nor do they have any money sent in.  So the gay guy goes into prison and he's treated like a hot chick at a bar.  There you go.  Buying drinks, just hoping that you get to go out.  Yeah.  Have a little date. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  Jeez.  Can you imagine getting traded for a pack of cigarettes?  Yeah, that's the worst part of the whole thing.  Yeah, that's degrading.  My God, you've traded me?  Because, see, I like the job this guy was doing on me, and now, because of a lousy pack of cigarettes, now I've got to do it with this guy.  No, it has nothing to do with the Marcellus Wallace scene in the basement of the pawn shop.  Yeah, that's the worst part, being traded for a pack of cigarettes. 
[01:58:30]  Well, here you just build a bond with your daddy.  You do the things he wants.  You're the greatest, man.  I love when you're here.  Yeah.  You really are the greatest.  After learning about this stuff, the worst thing you can say is, how much would it suck to be traded for a pack of cigarettes?  Yeah, get him.  Yeah, yeah.  Just.  Jesus.  What was creepier?  Zed having sex with Marcellus Wallace.  Yeah.  Or the guy standing there going, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, get him.  Get him.  Just f*** him.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that guy.  Well, I don't know.  That was a creep.  I think this might be a trick question.  I'm not falling for it.  You're not going to fall for it.  They're both bad.  I think the guy that was looking on was.  The gimp.  Just seemed creepier.  What was wrong with him?  Like, he would let Zed come over and then just like.  That's what I mean.  Totally get psyched at watching Zed?  I guess.  Seriously, if you need me to answer the question, that guy seems way creepier.  Because you think they'd both get a good laugh if they just would have dragged them both 
[01:59:30]  in at the same time.  And then he does Bruce Willis.  Right.  And the other guy, Zed, does Marcellus Wallace.  Oh, yeah.  Zed was just.  He was doing it as a goof.  The other guy had some severe issues.  Yeah.  Because he was all like, yeah, get him.  Get him.  All excited.  Hey, we got an update on.  Give me the watch.  We do have to take a break.  But we got an update there, Than.  And we got the chick that got woken up because a cat's bottom was on her face. 
[02:00:00]  Missy, what's up?  Hi.  Now you're happy?  No, not really.  Oh.  Well, you're a star today, though, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Thank you very, very much.  You're welcome.  And you sound much nicer now.  Wow.  Thank you.  I try.  So what were you thinking?  You're sleeping, obviously.  And all of a sudden, you're woken up and you see your cat's bottom on your face.  Did you go in the bathroom and brush your face?  Actually, I never saw him.  It was dark. 
[02:00:30]  And I was just completely out of it.  So I just kind of felt him, realized what it was, kicked him, and then rolled back over  and covered my face.  And then as soon as I got up, I went and I was so traumatized, I took a shower and washed  my hair with body soap instead of, you know, shampoo.  Wow.  You know what's weird about that whole thing?  If you, like, stood on your head, your husband wouldn't be able to tell which, you know, that  you were standing on your head.  Oh, if his eyes are shut just by sniffing around the room? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Thanks.  I know that was a stretch for a good line, but I tried.  Boy, did I.  You pulled it out.  It was a good attempt.  All right.  Thank you, Missy.  No problem.  I just wanted to thank you guys personally for that wonderful, wonderful wake up.  All right.  Litter box face.  You know, although the quarter stick of dynamite was quite impressive a couple weeks ago,  I think you might be in the lead for the best reaction.  Well, that makes me proud.  Wait, wait. 
[02:01:30]  I want to hear it again.  I know we just played it, but now I want to hear her reaction.  You're going to sleep on newspaper.  You're so groggy.  Hold on.  Let's play this again.  I love this bit, by the way, and they're getting more and more creative.  Good.  I'm glad.  This is you.  You sound a little different about an hour ago.  Yeah, we got Jesse from Pennsylvania.  He's going to wake up his wife by using a part of the cat.  Of the cat, yeah.  A part of the cat you would not want on your face.  A stinky part.  There you go.  Let's go, Jesse.  It's wake up your spouse Wednesday.  We haven't had a new one yet this week.  Get the phone right near her. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Why would you do that?  Say hi.  Say hi.  Why are you kicking me?  F*** you. 
[02:02:30]  I love it.  Oh, God.  Ew.  Why would you do that?  We got another great one.  Ew.  Why would you do that?  Say hi to O&A.  No?  Yeah, f*** off.  Oh!  Yeah.  Missy, you wake up a little cranky in the morning.  I do.  I do. 
[02:03:00]  But you have to understand, he wasn't home.  He was working, so the bedroom door was locked.  So I just, when somebody walks into your room, you get a little cranky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  I wasn't expecting him for some reason.  That is definitely great.  Thank you, Missy.  You're very, very welcome.  We would talk to you more, but we really have to take a break here.  We're late.  That's fine.  Have a great day, guys.  You too, Miss.  Missy, everybody from Pennsylvania.  Get some gum.  Quick break, and we'll be back and wrap up this portion of the show. 
[02:03:30]  We'll play a little round of What Did We Learn?  Very educational program.  I think we can do that.  Give us a call if you learned something.  It's like a day of college today.  Yeah.  877-212-ON-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  That was weird.  What happened?  I don't know.  I just realized we're on the radio.  That happens sometimes.  Like when I put my headphones on during the end of spots.  You're not falling asleep again, are you?  No, no, no, no, no.  It's something different, right?  No, no.  It's something different.  Okay, good.  But yeah, like when we're in here, it's not like we're on the radio. 
[02:04:00]  We're just kind of hanging out.  And I don't picture like our voices coming out of speakers in people's cars and whatnot.  Hi there.  I'm talking to you.  But like when I hear a spot like that, we just played one for NyQuil before we came back,  at least here in New York.  And I was like, oh, I kind of know like what that's like to drive and hear that come out.  Oh, wow.  We're actually on the radio.  You ever sit there and just go, who's listening to this crap?  Well, yeah, that's another thing.  I just can't imagine anyone's listening. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  I don't know.  There's the dumbest job.  There are times I'll be sitting in my seat going, who in their right mind would listen  to this crap?  Listening.  It's drivel.  It's a joke, by the way.  Of course.  For all you dummies out there.  Do you ever get disorientated?  What?  Disorientated?  Yeah.  I've never been disorientated once in my life, ever.  Really?  I've been disoriented.  Whatever.  You know the same thing.  No, not the same.  Yeah, disorientated is disoriented. 
[02:05:00]  It's the same thing.  You say disorient.  I say disorientated.  Let's call the whole thing off.  Disoriented.  Disoriented, yeah.  You ever feel that like when you're talking, you just feel outside of yourself?  That's called anxiety attack.  How did you know that?  Did you know that?  It's a separation of your mind from your body.  You look at your hand or your arm, and it looks like you shouldn't be able to feel it.  I went through that crap in my 20s, dude.  I had bad anxiety.  That was horrible.  Are you looking in the mirror?  You feel like it's not even you? 
[02:05:30]  You're not.  Yeah.  It's almost.  It's like you're a couple of inches outside of your body.  You're just kind of out, and you look at your hand.  The first time I ever got a real bad anxiety attack had to be in the middle 80s.  I was hungover, because that's when they usually would kick in, and I had to take off of work,  because I was hungover.  And I went to the deli, got a sandwich, because I was just feeling good enough to eat.  As I'm walking back to my apartment, I start getting this weird feeling, you know, that 
[02:06:00]  fast heartbeat, the breath, and I'm like, what is this?  Well, it must be the hangover.  Well, I reached for the doorknob of my apartment, and I swear I reached, but the hand I was looking  at wasn't my hand.  Nice.  It freaked me out so bad, I just, I rolled up on the couch in the fetal position, just  like, trying to figure out what was going on.  So then I had a choker.  And then, yeah.  Well, of course.  No, I just had to drink a lot more, and then I felt fine.  When I first got out, like, when I was 20, this was 30 years ago, they didn't know what 
[02:06:30]  anxiety was.  Yeah, it's in your 20s usually.  You really get it.  They thought I was getting nuts, so they put me in a hospital, and they gave me, like, Thorzine  and Haldol, and it was just, like, Thorzine shuffle around the hospital.  What the hell year were you in your 20s?  Oh, my God.  Electric shock therapy.  They put leather in our mouths and strapped us down.  Did Geraldo Rivera do an expose on you?  Did Chuck Heston come up and go, you cut out his brain, you bloody baboons?  This explains everything now, Rich.  Yep.  They took a piece of your brain, didn't they? 
[02:07:00]  They took a bit of your brain.  You left a part of your brain behind.  Did you ask if he dressed sexy for his doctors?  Oh, okay.  I could have sworn you said that.  I didn't want to copy it.  That he dressed sexy to get better drugs off of his doctors in the hospital?  Oh, no.  I didn't do that one.  I said dress sexy for other things.  Oh, yeah.  I referred to that about three or four times today.  You have to when he's here, you know.  Yes, of course.  Before we get into what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today, this just in,  Joe Torre has been traded to the Red Sox for a pack of smokes and a blank. 
[02:07:30]  All right, why don't we play what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, yeah.  What the hell?  See, that's one of those instances where I'm like, who's listening?  Today, I learned that I like turtles works like a retard mating call. 
[02:08:00]  No bones from P.A.  I learned that Voss would rather take, well.  Yeah.  No bones from P.A.  I learned that Voss would rather take it up the, yeah, than get traded for a pack of cigarettes.  Yep.  So, Rich from Manhattan, I learned that Rich Voss really wishes he was someone's prison bitch.  And Sergeant G from Iraq.  Is he really, like, calling in instant feedbacking from Iraq? 
[02:08:30]  I see him every day at this point.  Yeah.  He really is.  That's pretty damn cool.  Today, I learned that Bonnie reads Rich prison rape bedtime stories.  I'm sorry.  It's just, again, Deborah Harry is on there.  And they keep showing early footage of her with Blondie.  Now it's just, now she's gray-y.  You should just call her gray-y.  She's an old grandma. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  That's just sad.  That time is a bitch.  Oh.  Yeah, why?  Oh, they just did that.  They completely morphed from right from her face now to.  Fox 5 must hate her.  Why would you remind everyone watching your news channel how hot she used to be?  She was, like, a cute girl.  And now, look.  There she is.  Wasn't she all strung out and dope?  Yeah, she went through all that.  But who wasn't back then?  Right, Rich?  I was. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  Let's do some what do we learn here.  We'll go to C.M. Mark from Wack Bag.  C.M. Mark, what's up?  I learned that Cat Heine's make great line clocks, and no, I won't tell you about the  treadmill, good, Ben.  The treadmill what?  He went inside.  He went inside, yeah.  With what?  I don't know.  Maybe you can explain that to the show.  Corey, Columbus, what did you learn on the show?  I learned after calling in 10 times that the Opie and Anthony Cash Giveaway starts tomorrow 
[02:10:00]  at 7.15 and 7.30.  Not 7.15.  Oh, my God.  I don't have it right.  How?  Wow.  What did I learn today?  That you're a dummy.  Oh, my God.  You know what this makes me realize?  You know why this is so frightening?  This is for a contest on our radio show.  Our dopey radio show.  Things like the emergency broadcast system, if there's an emergency and they give out 
[02:10:30]  information on what to do, there'd just be people running around like chickens with  their heads cut off.  I don't know what to do.  They said just throw yourself off a pier.  I would bet a lot of money when they do the emergency broadcast test.  There's a handful of dummies that run out of their house just screaming.  Thinking that it's a disaster.  Screaming.  And you, you just think it's a nutcase, but it's just a dummy that doesn't understand  that it was just a test.  It's 7.  Let's try this again.  It's 7.30.  And the contest starts tomorrow.  Don't make a f***ing maniac out of me. 
[02:11:00]  We're going to give away $1,000 a day starting tomorrow.  Listen tomorrow for even more details.  How many more details can you give?  I don't know.  Just repeating the details over and over.  Some of you people are like dogs that make on the rug.  We just got to keep putting your nose in it and smacking you with the paper.  It's just like you said to your friend, hey, can you call me tomorrow between 7 and  7.30?  It's that easy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Call me tomorrow between 7 and 7.30.  Yeah, don't think about it like a radio contest.  That's confusing. 
[02:11:30]  You're very good, Rich.  Just call there.  It's like...  Give me a call tomorrow.  Sometime between 7 and 7.30.  Give me a call.  Sam Mark had the horribly long treadmill joke at Car Crash Comedy in New York City.  Linger Longer.  Rich O. from D.C.  Thank you for that.  I needed help with a little Linger Longer there.  What time do you say something?  Johnny, Boston, what's up?  Hey, I learned that to win the money tomorrow, you have to listen to I Like Turtles.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Barry. 
[02:12:00]  Barry, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  I learned that you can call ahead of time, even a day ahead of time of a contest, and  you still cannot win.  Well, maybe a lot of people felt like they were involved in a contest today.  Yeah.  And maybe that's exciting to them.  I don't know.  And if they made the air, they're all winners.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian?  In my book.  Brian!  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Brian.  Hey, I learned on the O.P. and Anthony show that when you say call in tomorrow between  7 to 7.30, actually called for calling now and be made fun of. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Illinois.  John?  Learn that tomorrow meets today.  Yeah.  Thank you, Chad.  The big boss is up in Chicago, so if this is our last broadcast on WCKG, it's been a lot  of fun.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, I would like to say goodbye to listeners instead of having radio stations yanked from  under our feet without the chance to say goodbye to people.  So we don't know.  Pittsburgh went back to some who-gives-a-crap format, so we lost our Pittsburgh audience. 
[02:13:00]  And Detroit went all sports.  We weren't allowed to say goodbye to them.  And West Palm Beach is searching for a morning show, and they're going to replace us.  And CKG, rumor has it, is going to do that fresh crap.  Fresh.  Dead Ben, Chicago.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Today, I learned that the rich boss prison is a place where dreams come true, and inmates,  and they just come.  You guys suck. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it was good.  I do believe we kind of just limped to the finish here because of that guy.  That was all right.  A little stumble as we go across the finish line today.  Next week, Caroline's with Tommy Davidson.  Yes, Rich Voss at Caroline's next week.  Don't be confused.  I'm not delining it.  I'm just working with him.  All right, you'll be there.  That's awesome.  All right, guys.  If you're not having a good day, then go to XM.  We'll see you over there.  I figured I would change it up a little bit for everybody.  Yeah.  Have a good day.  Bye. 
[02:14:00]  Bye.  O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  How does that sound for everybody?  Broadcasting.  Broadcasting live.  Yeah.  From the brand new O.P. and Anthony facility.  That's also used by Ron and Fez.  Of course.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[02:14:30]  Louder and louder.  I got to keep turning mine lower and lower.  Sorry.  Wow.  That's just kind of dumb that I control everyone's headphone volume.  It's really dangerous.  They should just take this knob off and then let everyone adjust accordingly with their own separate volume.  Because everyone knows.  O.P.  Sometimes we'll have a meeting and we do it here in the studio after the show.  And you'd swear that the monitor speakers in the studio are on.  And then someone goes, we shut them off.  And someone goes, no, that's O.P.'s headphones laying on the console. 
[02:15:00]  And they sound so loud that you think the monitors are on.  And my fiancee's mother gave me a hearing test.  How'd you do?  Very well.  Did you really?  Yeah.  What'd she do?  Blow an air horn?  You saw her that?  A fog horn.  One of those old school beep.  Yeah.  Have they updated that test over the years or is it still the same old? 
[02:15:30]  Raise your hand.  Boop.  Beep.  It was a.  Wait.  I don't know what mic that is, Rich.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  One of these.  Is that a qualification?  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  For you to marry her daughter that your hearing has to be at a certain level or something?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  Like she worked for the League of Hearing?  Yeah.  For real?  The League of Hearing?  Yeah, that's what it's called.  The League of Hearing.  What do you think it's called?  The League of, for hearing, it's the League of Hearing.  Oh, my God.  The League of Hearing.  Look, if he's right. 
[02:16:00]  Do they wear uniforms?  Do they have mascots?  I'll apologize if you're right and there is a League of Hearing.  Go to leagueofhearing.org.  I'm sure it's a .org.  I want to see how many leagues there are.  I just picked one of them as the League of Hearing.  Back at the League of Hearing.  Meanwhile.  Meanwhile.  At the League of Hearing.  And they all sit there just going, what?  Here at the League of Hearing?  It's Superman at the League of Hearing. 
[02:16:30]  Yes?  There's a league for the heart of hearing.  A league for the heart of hearing.  Yes.  That's not the League of Hearing.  That is not the League of Hearing.  And look how excited Rich gets.  Like, yeah, see, I told you.  I'm an expert.  You presented it as a government agency, you know, like the KGB and the League of Hearing,  the Ministry of the Nostrils.  I didn't say it was one of the branches of the government.  I said it was the League of Hearing where you go down.  The League of Hearing.  Because that's who we used to do the shows for.  20,000 leagues under hearing. 
[02:17:00]  So, no, it's like a birthday card.  Yeah.  You open up, and then, I don't know, there's like, I mean, you know about the League of  Hearing, so what's in this hearing test?  You open up your birthday card, and it's like, it looks like a birthday card type of thing.  You gotta be shitting me.  No, it's really easy now.  And then you, like, hold it at arm's length, so you're like this, and then you push, you  push something, and then that's a...  A button.  But what is it that...  You push something, a button. 
[02:17:30]  I want to be specific here.  And it's certain...  What you push is a button.  It's certain frequencies.  Certain frequencies.  Yeah.  And then you either hear it or you don't hear it.  And I heard every single one of them.  How do you know?  I think they throw in a...  I think they threw in a dummy switch where nothing happened, just to make sure you're  not saying yes or no or whatever.  Wow.  And I pass with flying colors.  Because I just remember the old headphones with the weird tones and different tones, 
[02:18:00]  and they get lower and lower and lower.  I know what's going on, though.  I got so much wax in my ear that it's protecting my ears.  Your eardrums?  Yeah, that's what I think is really going on.  Well, they say don't...  That's why I'm not cleaning out my ears ever.  Don't use Q-tips.  It's the number one.  Oh, yeah, because it pushes the peanut butter further into your head.  I mean, there's certain techniques, but not to use a Q-tip.  How do you need to wax out?  You're just supposed to use a Q-tip for the outside.  Yeah, for up in here.  But they have eardrops that you put in, and they'll pour the... 
[02:18:30]  You've got to use eardrops every so often, especially if you're in a job where you have  amplified sound going in your ears.  Then you take a little tissue and roll it up a little bit and put it in your ear, but just  circle around, and then lean your head there, and you'll pull out a big gob of disgustingness.  All right, so my hearing's good.  We've got to move on, because the O&A dump sheet for today...  By the way, good morning to Jim Norton, who got in from...  Jimmy's here!  From L.A.  Thank you.  A red-eye plane, and here he is for the XM portion of the show, which is awesome.  The brown-eye flight. 
[02:19:00]  We just did the CBS show, and the dump report is great.  Let's run through it fast until we get to this section.  604.  Even the people in Thailand were offended, and they sell young children for sex?  That shouldn't have been dumped.  That should have been dumped.  That should not have been dumped.  I wasn't talking...  It's a fact that I was saying, and even they were offended was kind of a play on what I  had just said.  Like, isn't that amazing?  How could they possibly be offended when they sell young children for sex? 
[02:19:30]  A terrestrial radio once again being relevant and in touch with what's going on.  All right.  6.45, fuck it, by a caller.  Okay.  And this is where it gets funny.  6.53, I want him sprayed with it.  Opie, discussion about sending a diarrhea truck to mess with a guy from the Scott  and Todd show.  Oh, and then I have to reiterate with a little question here.  You want him sprayed with diarrhea?  They really would dump out a diarrhea.  Oh, well, in that context, because you're spraying diarrhea. 
[02:20:00]  You can say diarrhea.  The good news is, so there is some hope for regular radio.  They allowed diarrhea truck to go through.  Yeah.  They allowed the old diarrhea truck to go through.  You just can't say spray him with diarrhea.  What would they assume you want them to do with it when you get the truck gets there,  or just fucking have them drive it around the block?  Yeah, have a fun little ride.  Oh, my God.  What's the use of sending liquid shit to somebody if they're not going to get it on them?  I like how the time is exactly the same where you go, I want him sprayed with it.  And I go, you want him sprayed with diarrhea? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, no shit.  Oh, God, that's going to make me laugh all day.  7.12, I suck cock for K-Rock.  Got dumped out.  7.27, I'm going to put my cat's ass right on her face.  Yeah.  During Wake Up Your Spouse, this was flowed.  I should say followed, right?  This was followed by One saying this was probably dumped.  Wow.  Is that really dumpable if it's not sexual?  Tracy walked in and said that I got through.  I know.  So that might have been a, maybe she was listening to the wrong, I don't know. 
[02:21:00]  That should have been dumped, whatever.  Who gives a shit?  7.28, fucking.  7.28, fuck off.  8.24, the little white dude pooped all over the black dude.  Yeah, haunting story.  Because we learned that Rich Voss likes hot prison rape stories.  Yeah, he goes to a website and reads these men, not women rape, but he reads these men  stories about how they were raped in prison.  It's really a cool site. 
[02:21:30]  But here's the thing.  It's not about just a rape, it's just about the prison, life in prison.  But the rape is in there.  Well, that's like icing on the cake.  You know, you go to the back.  Basically, in between the hot stories, you're going to learn a thing or two about prison.  Yeah, that's what you go there for.  I get rich.  For a little knowledge.  8.55 and inmates just come.  And inmates just come, yeah.  And punt.  And punt.  So that's our dump sheet for the day. 
[02:22:00]  Guy wiped out my whole computer on the phone the other day.  Oh, I threw it at the camera now.  This guy called to erase, to delete a file, to get rid of a program.  He said, do this, right?  Everex.  Am I allowed to say the name of it?  Because they ruined it.  So this is what happened.  He goes, we'll do this.  We'll do a recovery thing.  I go, this isn't going to erase all my programs.  He goes, no, no.  I asked him twice.  So I do a punt.  And it just erased everything on my computer.  Then I call Everex. 
[02:22:30]  And I'm fighting with the supervisor.  I go, we'll put him on the phone.  He goes, I can't.  He's helping another customer.  I go, he just erased everything on my computer.  Why would you let him still work with people, right?  And I just want to say that Everex stinks.  Then you shouldn't have needed help.  Well, nothing.  He said he was going to call me back.  There's nothing more they could do.  So why shouldn't he have just continued helping the other guy?  Well, shouldn't he be reprimanded?  You were the fuck up.  No, he was.  Shouldn't he be reprimanded for erasing everything on, you know, I mean, that's probably the number  one thing you don't want to do to one of your customers is delete everything on their 
[02:23:00]  computer.  I think it takes a lot to do that.  A system recovery, you press like R, you keep pressing, he did whatever, and everything  is gone.  Oh, my God.  You press R for system R.  I know.  I know.  He just kept having me do this thing.  And then everything was erased off my computer.  And they said, well, you know, I think you should be reprimanded.  I said, don't fire him.  Are you sure you weren't pressing E for erase by accident?  Erase.  No.  No.  And I listened to it step by step.  And then the supervisor at Everx said, I'll get back to you after I listened to the 
[02:23:30]  tape.  What's Everx?  A boner pill company?  I know.  Yeah, really?  Some computer I bought.  It's a little one.  Oh, my God.  You have a computer that no one ever heard of.  That's the brand of it?  It's Everx?  Yeah.  Everx?  You deserve to have everything erased.  I'm glad everything hit the R.  You bought that from someone's truck.  I want to.  My sister recovered, matey.  Arr.  Everx, huh?  Yeah.  Not Dell.  Not Mac.  Everx.  No, I have a Dell at home.  That sounds like a condom.  Yeah.  I wear Everx. 
[02:24:00]  I went with the boner pill joke.  Well, because here's the thing.  It was a small.  You know how you want those smaller ones to travel with?  A laptop.  A laptop?  Yeah.  No, not the big.  I mean, it's like a little smaller.  Yeah.  A laptop.  But some were like $1,400 and this one was $700.  With you, your technology is $700 instead of $1,400.  Yeah, or whatever.  But see, his...  Ah, whatever.  Get what you pay for.  Yeah, technology-wise, you're always behind.  So they make most laptops small now.  Real small.  No.  All your laptops are... 
[02:24:30]  I'm talking about little.  We like our smut really large on the road.  I like a big laptop.  17-inch.  You like a big one?  It's too heavy to...  No, I'd rather lug it around for where you got to go.  Because once you get to the hotel room, you're not going to be carrying it around.  And then you got a nice big fucking computer in your room.  And why do you want a small laptop so when you're watching those prison rape videos, you  don't want anyone else noticing that you're watching that stuff?  R.  Yeah, what the fuck are you doing with a little laptop anyway?  Not good for graphics or pictures. 
[02:25:00]  I'm trying to tell you a story about everything being erased and you're attacking me for having  a little laptop.  Yeah, a little laptop.  Well, maybe I have little hands and I want a little laptop.  You know what?  For once, we weren't going with the little hand joke.  You went there.  We were actually wondering really why.  Well, because I like...  Because it fits in my...  What I want to talk about is your tiny jeans you're wearing.  Opie just bashed him so bad on the way down from CBS in the elevator.  Well, he got me backed all the way up.  He goes, what size pants are those?  And Buzz is like, why?  Are they too long?  He goes, no.  He goes, are those capris for normal people? 
[02:25:30]  Well, wait.  Here's the...  When I'm ironing my pants...  He even admitted that when he irons his own pants.  It's embarrassing to see how short...  He feels like they're too short.  It just takes like three minutes for you to iron your pants.  When I'm ironing them, I go, my legs can't be that small.  Dude, I think you're under a 28-inch length.  No, it's 32-30.  There's no way.  It's not.  There's no way.  No, it's not.  No.  No way.  No.  You actually just lay the iron on your pant leg and then pull it up and the whole pant  leg is done.  You don't even have to move it up and down.  No sugar.  Hey, Mars.  You got like one of those measuring devices? 
[02:26:00]  It's called a tape measure.  Get a Jew tailor in here.  Yeah, we want to measure your leg.  Check his inseam.  Yeah, we want to measure your cock.  Prelude to a prison rape.  I love it.  When I farted on the elevator, what was your...  Well, he did get me back because I beat him up about his pants and then like we're coming  up to XM and Jimmy would have been proud.  The elevator was packed.  It was a loud fucking fart.  And then he thought he had the escape, but it opened up on the fourth floor and then  he had to come back in.  And the door hit me in the head as I'm coming back. 
[02:26:30]  And you just hear everyone around just going, oh, that's fucking disgusting.  It was so loud.  All right, measure it now.  No, someone else has to measure.  It's got to be your inseam right at the crotch.  Is that how you do length?  Yeah.  Right at the crotch of your inseam.  And not to the floor either.  What do you mean I have to have fucking...  What do you mean not to the floor?  It has to be to the end of your jeans.  To where you want your pants to stop.  We want to measure how short your jeans are. 
[02:27:00]  To the end of your jeans.  It doesn't matter if you take your...  Kenny, measure Rich's inseam.  Dude, you could be standing in high-heeled shoes.  It just goes to the bottom of the shoe.  And Kenny, I'm sorry I did your bit today.  The fucking pants.  Don't report.  That's all right.  No, here.  Kenny, make sure he's doing it right.  Yeah.  Slipping an inch in on me.  What does he got?  27 and a half.  27 and a half.  I said less than 28.  They're fucking jean diapers. 
[02:27:30]  He's wrong.  27 and a half.  He's wrong.  He went from the crotch down.  That's the inseam.  That's what you measure.  27 and a half.  To the cuff of the jean.  How tall are you?  That's what's bizarre.  5'7 and a half.  Yeah, because you're not like short short.  But he's all torso.  You're a tall dwarf.  Voss is a fucking tall dwarf.  He even has like dwarf fingers.  A tall dwarf.  27 and a half. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, he's a dwarf.  Look at Voss' head.  He has a dwarfish head and torso.  I'm not even making fun of you.  You have a dwarfish body and head.  He can hit a golf ball out, man.  I'm sure he can.  He's terrific.  That's strong torso.  Yeah, it's all upper body strength.  And his hands are closer to the ball because of his short little legs.  Wow.  That is 27.  I don't think that was right.  I know you don't.  And a half.  No, that's right. 
[02:28:30]  It's tape measure.  And Dan from Long Island, he writes, Voss just said he wears 3230 jeans.  How tall is he?  I'm 5'8", and the same size jeans fit me perfectly.  Well, I'm 5'7 1⁄2".  Aw.  I know, but he wears 3230.  Yeah, and I wear 3230.  You're about the same height as that guy, but you're wearing 27 1⁄2 jeans.  Those are not 3230 pants.  These were tailored wrong, maybe.  Tailored wrong.  You might have bought them off the rack.  Those are off the rack.  I get all my pants tailored.  They fit me.  All right. 
[02:29:00]  I asked you what size.  So you did get 3230s, but they're tailored down to a 27 1⁄2.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Here's the thing.  Well, no, here's where you're wrong.  When you buy expensive jeans like this, they're always too long, so you've got to get them tailored.  But I know I'm 3230.  Maybe because when you get older, you shrink a little.  When you get older.  So you know you're 3230, but guess what?  Oh, my God.  The tape measure knows that you're 32, 27 1⁄2. 
[02:29:30]  You didn't know.  When you get older, your body shrinks a little.  How come your torso hasn't shrunk?  I'll bet you he's longer than most people from the torso.  Yeah.  Like you're a little appution almost in your fucking pant leg length, but I'll bet you your torso is longer than most people.  Than most people's torsos.  But your arms are a little short.  Yeah.  To box with God.  That old gag.  It's an old gag.  Not a play.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an old gag.  A hero ain't nothing but a sandwich, too.  That's right.  Yep.  That's a play, too? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  Well.  All right.  Thanks, boss.  Hold on.  What?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I'm seeing how long my hands go down.  Well, now you're bending over.  Stand up completely straight.  Clutch it over.  Stand up straight.  Wow.  Your hands don't even go further than your hips.  Your hands don't sound like.  Yes, they do.  Wow, yours go pretty long.  They're supposed to.  Because we're normal size, you freak of nature.  Your hands are supposed to hang like.  Fuck.  Where do you hang?  My arms are a little longer than they should be, I guess.  I got long. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I got long, long arms.  All you guys have long arms.  No.  You just have a long torso and short arms.  Well, this one doesn't bend as far as this one.  It's a weird sit down.  You're lucky you can get into your pockets.  Do you have to sit down and get into your pockets?  Please do a headstand when he needs change.  Right.  Hey, he's cartwheeling in Starbucks, hoping something falls out.  Someone's asking, well, it's Jane Doe from Jersey. 
[02:31:00]  Voss's jeans are expensive jeans.  What are they?  Sergio Valente's?  Sergio Valente, that's going back.  That's 1985.  He snagged himself a hot wife.  What are you going to say about the guy?  I always had hot girls.  His cum made a couple of hot little daughters.  I always got hot girls.  Always.  Voss always pulled fucking eight and a halves or better.  Yeah.  It's depressing.  Jesus.  Because he would always meet them sitting down, like out of the car windows. 
[02:31:30]  They're like, oh, here's a normal size guy.  I'll tell you what it was also.  It was a fucking, they were probably all coke whores.  I got clean.  You had some bodies, man.  You had whore bait.  We interrupt this guy.  What?  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Hi, O.  Well, that's the joke.  You're just taking the guy's joke away from me.  Oh, am I taking his joke?  Right.  Rich from Ohio.  What's happening, boy? 
[02:32:00]  You're on the air.  You got a midget sighting?  I got a midget sighting for you.  We're in the middle of Ohio, a small town.  This guy walks into my store.  Oh, he didn't take your bit.  He's about three and a half foot tall, and he's dressed as a punk rocker.  There is no punk rock in this town.  He's drawing attention to himself.  An attention whore midget.  Wait, so it's a midget punk rocker?  Yeah.  With the spiked hair.  How tall is he, 4'10"?  He's about, no, he's about 3'10", 4'4", wearing all black, and punked out. 
[02:32:30]  So it was just his look.  He didn't do anything silly, though.  No, he was just drawing attention to himself.  I like when they do silly things.  The little punk club out there for midgets is called Heebie-Jeebies.  All right, you're not going to beat that, sir.  Thank you.  Back at the show.  A little creepster. 
[02:33:00]  I should have let you do the bit.  I thought he was doing the bit that you were going to do.  I know.  I was doing the...  I'm sitting right here at a radio show, and to my right is a little midget.  Yeah.  All right.  He's trying to hold on to the microphone.  I shook a midget's hand.  It's like shaking an old baseball glove from, like, the 40s.  Yeah.  It's puffy.  It's puffy.  And then the little Vienna sausage fingers that just poke out.  So I can know the same deal.  The little knuckles don't bend.  They can't grip around your hand.  So it's this straight-handed, puffy thing. 
[02:33:30]  Yuck.  All those freaks.  It's almost like a Nerf ball or something.  I always said it's like shaking a muffin.  Just take a muffin and put it in your hand and shake it.  And squeeze it, too.  Because you get that same thing.  You get a little squeeze of his muffin hand.  And try to give it eye contact and pretend it's an eagle.  I want to bite those little fucking palms.  Just hold your hand and bite the palm.  Yeah.  Oh, they're so puffy. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  That's where all their height went.  Hey, we didn't do the Morning Zoo bit of the day yet.  So why don't we get this out of the way?  Morning Zoo bit of the day.  It's a terrific one from West Palm Beach.  We're going to be leaving the West Palm Beach airwaves soon?  Yeah, who knows.  They've been in search of a new morning show for the last six to eight months.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're going to replace us with, like, no names from another city.  Instead of just promoting the show.  Yeah, that's smart.  I guess so they get a local show. 
[02:34:30]  Have fun with your local show.  You can talk about West Palm Beach traffic.  That's why people will listen.  All right.  So I mentioned that because the Morning Zoo bit of the day comes from a station out of  West Palm Beach, Florida.  The same people that gave us hell no to H2O.  Oh, God.  That fucking piece of shit.  Well, it's from Wild 95.5 in West Palm Beach.  They're wild. 
[02:35:00]  They got a new song called The Diet Rap.  Here is your Morning Zoo bit of the day.  This is his latest release.  It Ain't Easy Being a Fatty.  It's the Value Meal Killer here once again.  This is an anthem for all my fat brothers and sisters out there struggling with their weight.  I'm sick and tired of people saying we gots to eat a salad.  You know what?  Let's deep fry our salad.  Drenched with dressing.  Hell yeah.  Sing it with me.  It rhymes salad with salad, Jimmy. 
[02:35:30]  It's good.  I'm so sick of counting calories.  I'm a better man with clogged arteries.  Yeah.  I'm so sick of counting calories.  I'm a better man with clogged arteries.  If I drink more water, I swear I'll die.  The way you make water better is to have it fried.  If you say fat free, I'll slap your face.  I'll get a violent one.  But you can't fry water.  No.  No.  That would be very difficult.  But that's how you make it better.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  My food has no taste.  The doctor says I'm a walking heart attack.  You doctor, shut your mouth.  Get me a Big Mac.  Some other greats have been chubby and fat.  They're laughing.  Santa Claus, Grimace, and President's half.  The key to life, eat food with grease.  I don't care.  I'm morbidly obese.  This diet light is something I hate.  I need saturated fat and carbohydrates.  If I die before I wake, bury me with a pizza and a chocolate milkshake. 
[02:36:30]  Yo, this is a tribute to all my fat brothers and sisters who will be lost.  Rest in peace, Chris Farley.  That guy in a little close.  Rest in peace now, Carter.  Give me a break.  Rest in peace, Buddha.  Anything?  Last but not least, rest in peace, Elvis.  I'm out.  Elvis.  I'm starved.  Let's get some to eat, people.  I tell you what, you're not half a bad rapper.  I mean, your skills are getting better.  They are.  They are. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, the hole chimes in.  Oh, my God.  Fan point to that, they really hate water, too.  Wow.  They are really against water.  You could have a greatest hit CD.  Oh, there's songs about water.  What's this guy wash his ball bag with?  Bacon grease?  I mean, what did water ever do to you, pal?  I sure like to know.  Oh, jeepers.  Oh, just like that Florida sun.  It's raining, right?  I mean, maybe he had a kid, but then Tommy Lee was babysitting him, and he's held a grudge. 
[02:37:30]  Boy, I'm sure you don't like water.  Water?  Hey, with that water.  Turned him into a skateboard park.  That was written by Ted Yates.  Maybe there was a leak in the hole.  Here's the thing, how unrealistic they are.  Wait, what?  No, it was too racist.  How unrealistic when he said doctor instead of saying clinic.  Are you proud of yourself, Rich? 
[02:38:00]  Because you're the only one.  I love that.  It's like when you do something wrong.  Are you proud of yourself?  It's not even...  Not a mocking thing.  It's just pure guilt.  He was all excited.  Like, he came up with something, but I don't know what it is.  I just love doing that voice.  Let's all just sit around here.  Another water song on the way. 
[02:38:30]  This guy doesn't want to live to be too old, all the cops.  His skin must look dry.  Like a water.  I love that.  Well, that was genuinely awful.  Yeah, absolutely.  Is an intern on the job?  Wait, can I...  Than?  Wait.  Thank you.  Because before we change subjects, can I just point out something very obvious?  That morning show is probably beating us in the ratings of West Palm Beach. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why wouldn't they be?  With fucking great shit like that.  I guess we have to do a water song pair.  Yeah.  Water.  Surrounded by it down there.  You know, they probably aren't nice to it.  Yeah.  Water.  You know, pay tribute to water.  Uh-huh.  Fry it.  Whip out your water Wednesday.  I don't know.  He did rhyme salad with salad, too.  Yeah, at the beginning, you rhymed salad with salad, which is just...  Don't do that in front of Jimmy.  He will go crazy.  I know. 
[02:39:30]  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Listen, I got the three themes of the day.  Okay.  All right.  West Palm Beach.  Deep-flying food.  I mean, it's E-Rock-tober.  What was the last one?  Are you proud of yourself?  Well, listen.  I also got an early what did I learn.  I have some pride.  Any time you crack on E-Rock, you get right through.  Oh, I know.  Because they all hate him.  Yeah.  Which makes for a great work environment when everybody hates the one guy. 
[02:40:00]  It's terrific.  As long as it's not everyone hating everybody.  Tommy in Brooklyn, what's up?  Two things, guys.  One, Richie, how old are those jeans that you're going to shrink into them?  You need them to be tailored.  What are you talking about?  You said the body shrinks.  So you're buying your clothes, planning on shrinking into them?  No, no, no, no.  The other thing, guys, is why don't you just have him take his pants off and check and see what size is on the tag. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Well, because it's going to say 3230, but here's the thing.  If I can borrow from Rich Voss.  He bought them as 3230s, but he has to get them tailored because he has short legs.  And that's why they're 3227.5, but he still says they're 3230s because he bought them as 3230s.  But they're not 3230s anymore.  You'd be stepping all over them.  Right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:41:00]  Let's talk about water some more.  Yeah.  Comics in the 80s.  Remember when they used to all do the parodies to rap?  I mean, that was in the 80s.  Oh, when you're rapping.  Comics used to close with, you know, let's do a rap parody.  You thought that was over with maybe by 1992.  Yeah.  And they're still doing it in 2007.  Those guys aren't comics, though.  They're morning shows.  It doesn't matter.  It's just the fact that it's not even been done.  And what do you mean there's comics used to do what? 
[02:41:30]  They used to close their shows, a lot of comics, and they would do a song parody to a rap when rap was getting hot.  Do we have examples of those?  I would love to hear some of those.  There's got to be a million of those comics.  Was it one of those things they were doing?  I'm sorry.  I'm reading this prison story.  Oh, you remember when comics in the 80s were closed doing rap parodies?  Oh, my God.  It's...  I can't...  That's all I can say.  And would they stop and fold their arms?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And tilt their head a little bit?  But it...  Thank you. 
[02:42:00]  Good night.  It was the corniest white guy shit.  Yeah.  Do we have an example?  Who would do...  Who did those?  I don't know.  Just road acts you would work with.  They're all nameless, as they should be.  So whatever the rap song that was hot, they would just redo it?  Yeah, or just some rap about the thing, or they would do a rap about the fucking audience.  It was just...  It was awful.  If they closed with a rap...  Because they knew they were going to get a...  And plus, it was like the middle act.  So you're headlining on the road, and now the middle act is closing with some rap parody, 
[02:42:30]  and the audience is going nuts.  Then you go out with your hatred, and they hate you after that just beautiful rap song.  All right.  We've got to find one of those.  I've got to hear that now.  There was some joke headliners used to tell, like something about the show ain't over  until the middle did his rap, or something.  It was like a Fat Lady Sings thing.  Oh, really?  It was that obvious.  But yeah, it was that big of a thing in the 80s.  Was it...  What was the pinnacle?  Rap and Rodney?  Was that the one that...  Oh, maybe.  ...they were all trying to follow?  Didn't Richard Jenny have one?  Now you all go home and go to bed, I'm going to put a bullet in my head. 
[02:43:00]  Something like that.  He was a nice...  You proud of yourself?  Are you proud of yourself?  Did I tell you what Bonnie said about...  I don't know if I told you guys anything.  There was a picture.  It's from the Oscars.  It was Jenny.  If Jenny's standing there, Chris Rock, then me.  Right?  Bonnie said, out of these three people, which one do you think would have killed themselves?  That is funny.  Bonnie.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:43:30]  God bless Bonnie.  God damn.  I love the fact that she said it probably with no one around, just you two.  Not even to get a laugh.  She was actually saying it to herself and he overheard it.  Hey, let's say hi to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  I just wanted to say that the other caller was right.  If you say, I fucking hate E-Rock, they put you right in.  I had nothing else.  There he goes.  I just wanted to say that and see if it worked and it did. 
[02:44:00]  That's E-Rock-tober, so any attention he gets.  It is true.  Now he turns up his radio.  I got to hear me.  Hey, let's listen to Rappin' Rodney.  Oh.  Oh, God.  This is such a douche show.  This is the first, but we got to find others.  It's a douche.  It really is bad.  I tell you, I'm all right now, but last week I was in rough shape.  I don't get a break with nothing.  I played hide and seek when I was three.  No respect.  No respect.  Why they wouldn't even look for me. 
[02:44:30]  No respect.  No respect.  I was an ugly kid.  I never had fun.  No respect.  No respect.  They took me to a dog show and I won.  No respect.  No respect.  When I was born, I bought no joy.  No respect.  No respect.  My old man said he wanted a boy.  No respect.  No respect.  I was an ugly kid, always alone.  No respect.  No respect.  Halloween, I had to trick or treat over the phone.  No respect.  He gets all his lines in there.  Don't call.  My phone don't ring. 
[02:45:00]  I don't get a break with anything.  What's the matter, Rodney?  Ah, death.  Where is my sting?  It's just rapping, Rodney.  Ain't that too tight?  No, no.  This hurts.  Now it's Rodney.  I didn't hate that one.  Oh, God.  Now it's Rodney. 
[02:45:30]  Rodney would have laughed at that one.  It's not bad because it's his act and they just kind of, you know, through.  And it's Rodney.  Made into a rap song.  But the whole bad rap and the black backup singer girls and the.  Yeah, let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey.  The guy's name is Barry Sobel.  I remember Barry Sobel.  Ah, yeah.  Well, there was a million of them, but Barry, you're right.  Hold on, hold on.  What's, do you know the name of it?  Because we might have it in the system.  No, he was on that one, the Dangerfield, what Dice Clay was on. 
[02:46:00]  Dice Clay first came out.  You're right.  That one show, he was on that.  Like, he wore his hat sideways, looked like a real retard.  That was part of his act, though, that he was, like, kind of urban and stuff.  Like, he was, like, a white rapper.  Oh, that had to be, like, 88, 89, maybe.  Before it was cool, by the way, to be a white rapper.  Barry Sobel was kind of doing that thing.  Oh, this story looks good.  Thanks, boys.  Take care.  All right, I'll try to find it.  A man arrested for trying to cash a $1 million bill. 
[02:46:30]  It's in our machine ready to roll, bro.  Oh, look at him.  You dummy.  Here's a million dollars.  Okay.  Do they have change?  He'll try to cash it.  Didn't even try to buy some gum.  So it wasn't just like, can I have some change?  Here, I'd like to buy this.  YouTube search Rappin' Duke.  It'll give you douche chills.  Oh, by the way, did that link for the guitar thing on YouTube?  Dead end?  Not good for radio.  Why?  It's a visual. 
[02:47:00]  Oh.  Guy said it was funny, though.  No, sometimes it just looks funny.  Not even worth explaining.  No sound.  Ha ha.  Okay.  Man flips out over clerk's refusal to cash $1 million bill.  Yes, this is the story that everyone's talking about today.  Yeah, the giant eagle here just behind me is on Cedar Avenue.  And quite frankly, one of the employees told me a few minutes ago that the man just went  into this real bad tantrum, and this is a photocopy of the $1 million bill he tried to get changed  for at the customer service desk.  So we asked who would try to get changed for a $1 million bill. 
[02:47:30]  This is the man.  His name is Samuel Porter, according to Pittsburgh police, 66 years old, we believe, from Pittsburgh.  Now, police say that he went into the giant eagle, asked for a change for a million-dollar bill,  and the employees said that they would not give him change and told him that the bill was not real.  They took the bill, and he became irate and broke some of the equipment at the customer service window.  Ha ha ha.  How do you go? 
[02:48:00]  Was it explain how he got the dollar?  The $1 million bill or whatever?  I don't know.  See, this is a story there should be more details on.  We got a second.  How did he get it?  Was he trying to pass off a fake one, or did he think it was a real million-dollar bill?  Was it a food stamp million-dollar bill?  Hopefully he sold all of his possessions for it and lost everything.  By the way, Tate Myers from Virginia.  Hey, Ope, I found a Voss rap from the 80s.  I didn't know you did a little rap in your acting, Voss.  My name is Rich Voss, and I love crack rocks, but when I don't have money, I just suck fat cocks. 
[02:48:30]  That's how comics would have done their bits.  That's how they would have closed it.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Eric B. from New Hampshire.  Don't forget the Paula Poundstone rap.  I won't tell you what I did, just don't let me near your kid.  Here's the second half of the story.  You got one, Jimmy?  Michael Richards rap.  I bet he's figuring something. 
[02:49:00]  Roy Rogers.  Roy Rogers had a horse and his name.  I don't remember that.  I was on a show.  None was bigger.  Remember Digger the dog?  Yes, of course.  What do we got, Travis?  The million dollar bill, those are handed out by churches.  I don't know if you've ever seen them, but they fold them up, so it looks like it's a 
[02:49:30]  folded bill, but it's really only like three quarters the size of a real bill.  Yeah, I've seen those, and it looks like it's folded in half.  So he tried to cash that.  Yeah.  That?  Yes.  Wow.  Is there a picture of it?  Oh, no, I just thought maybe you had it on there.  Where's the second half of the story?  I really don't know anything about the background of this gentleman at this time, so I can't  say that he has any mental illness or what may be the case, but to come in and try to 
[02:50:00]  get change for a million dollar bill, it's a bit different.  At this hour, Porter is in the Allegheny County Jail.  He's been charged with forgery and criminal mischief.  Pittsburgh police say they also called in the Secret Service to do some investigating  on this matter.  His bail's a million dollars.  Yeah, he just, he posted it and left.  Your bail's a million.  Well, they got it at the supermarket.  The bail is like, no!  Damn it.  We don't know his background.  Well, one, I guess he quit school in fourth grade. 
[02:50:30]  Hold on a minute.  Let's go to Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I don't know who was just on, because I'm on my wife's car, and she's got PLJ on, because  she doesn't know the exit.  Good excuse.  But they just had some guy in there, and Scott and Todd were slamming you guys, saying, yeah,  none of ONA's listeners were able to disrupt anything.  We didn't see a single wow sticker anywhere.  I didn't catch who the guy was, though.  Oh, do we even really?  Do they really want to challenge us?  We were looking for a diarrhea truck. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, we didn't want-  I don't think we were serious.  We didn't want honking of horns or wow stickers.  We wanted a diarrhea truck.  Yeah.  And we couldn't find one.  I wouldn't worry about them.  Believe it or not, we were actually being a little responsible, because we told the listeners  to go out there and smack them upside the head while they were driving by, or shoot them  with a paintball gun or something.  We'd get in trouble.  This is like the guy who goes-  It was my wife listening.  It's like the comic that goes into the comedy club and goes, listen, I do a joke.  Do you know of any gay clubs in town that do a joke about gay clubs? 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's what I-  Is that the one-  Yeah, that's what the comic-  I do a joke about gay clubs.  Never heard of that.  Did you, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Now, does this gay club stay open past two?  That's in the joke, right?  Is that something?  Because I've never heard that, Rich.  Is that something you use?  No, that's what a comic-  If a gay comic goes into town.  Exactly.  So this guy used that, like, well, my wife was listening to Scott and Todd, but he really  was.  Don't lie and put it all off on your wife.  Just saying, hey, does this gay club serve food? 
[02:52:00]  It's in the joke, in the bit.  Rich, so what are you trying to say?  Is that when you would go into clubs and say-  No, it's when a comic goes into clubs and he's gay, but he doesn't want people to know  he's gay.  That's exactly.  And he would-  Why are you staring at me like that?  I've never heard of a comedian asking that.  Never.  If you do it in a bit, like you say, so you go, I want to do it in a bit.  Let's just get it out of the way.  How many cocks have you sucked?  None.  Never.  None.  I mean, for crack, we'll understand.  I think you're confusing him.  You got to break it down. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Clipped and unclipped.  Right.  Right, right.  How many under six?  How many over eight?  Right.  This guy in Atlanta emails me.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So you sucked his head.  Oh, no, no, no.  Let me tell you what happened.  There's one in Atlanta.  No, no.  He emailed me.  Let me keep track.  Write it down.  Write a count.  He emailed me.  One Atlanta cock.  Was it during Freaknik?  Can I tell you the story?  That might have to count as two or three.  All right.  One cock in Atlanta.  Yes.  I never-  He emails me.  This guy goes, I'm attracted to the-  So as a comic writing back, I go, cut or uncut. 
[02:53:00]  So then he keeps writing back to me.  I go, look, pal, this is never going to happen.  As a comic, you know, you would write that back.  Cut or uncut, isn't that a joke?  Because as a comic, you know, you just-  And I can't help just be funny all the time.  You can't help just hitting the delete button and just not acknowledge it.  You don't respond to someone like that who's hitting on you.  You got to make a joke about it.  Did he write back uncut?  What's that?  He probably wrote back uncut.  Yeah, we all need to know.  I didn't like that.  He was like, no, that's just creepy.  No, if I was going to be with a guy, it'd have to be cut.  All right.  So yeah.  All right.  So you only like sucking cock to cut cock.  Cut cock.  You have a whole profile in five minutes. 
[02:53:30]  So he's sucked one cut cock.  One cut cock so far.  In Atlanta.  And he prefers a cut.  Never.  Listen, John Douglas.  Here's the thing.  I've never-  Prefers a cut.  If you're fessing up to sucking one dick in Atlanta, you probably suck dicks closer than  that.  First of all, yeah.  It's like roaches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like roaches, right?  If there's one roach around, you know, there's many others.  Right around the corner.  Lights go on.  Sure.  Rich is sucking cots all over the place.  All right.  Ew.  Ew. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Go ahead.  So-  Never.  You wrote him back.  And so, but now he thinks, so I go, this will never happen.  I was joking with you.  And he writes me back that I was gay bashing, saying, oh, now you're a gay basher.  They get so offended if you say no to them.  No, you're just a fucking top.  Who?  You.  Not a gay basher.  Fucking top.  No.  Top motherfucker.  And I-  No.  And you what?  You were ready to admit it.  And that's okay. 
[02:54:30]  Listen, if I was gay.  You're married now with three kids.  It doesn't matter.  Go ahead.  What's the big deal?  Look, first of all, you would love that because you'd have another hour.  I'm smashing me.  But I'm not.  You know what?  I'm not at all gay.  I mean, everybody's thought about it.  It doesn't mean you're twice.  Everyone.  Okay.  Everyone.  Everyone.  I like the, the, the, everyone has thought about what?  Sucking.  The best thing gay guys say is, uh, is, uh, oh, everyone is a six pack away from being  gay. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, no, no.  It's like, uh, no.  Everybody has a six pack of cum.  Pendencies when you act on them.  They mean the abs.  You know, you've thought about murder, but you haven't done it, right?  As far as you know.  That's what, you know.  Uh, so, you know, I've never thought, I haven't thought about it since, you know, I don't know.  Thought about what?  Sucking cock since when?  Probably in my, you know, I don't know.  In between, uh, my first wife and second. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Write that down in the profile.  Okay.  Any other, uh, gay guys hit on you?  While you're out and about?  No.  Yeah, I'm sure I've had some, you know.  I mean, I'm not a bad looking guy.  It's a compliment.  What's the difference if a guy hits on you or a girl?  It's still a compliment.  Somebody's going to good looking.  What's it, you know.  So, it makes you feel good when a gay guy hits on you?  No, it makes me uncomfortable, you know.  But you're like, all right, cool.  I know I have it.  No, I mean, you know.  Why are you uncomfortable?  Because you have to wipe your own pre-cum off. 
[02:56:00]  His helmet gets stuck to the inside of the little box or something.  Well, Jordan.  He likes me.  Following the Rich Vos way from Pittsburgh, he writes, here's the thing.  If I had to be with a guy, his cock would have to be tailored.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  Rap and Duke.  What's this again?  Oh, it's terrible.  It's like John Wayne rap.  Oh, God, this one, it's so bad. 
[02:56:30]  This was kind of a hit, too.  This is actually a funny one, though.  Oh, shut up.  This is funny.  It's not, you don't think it is.  I do.  I get embarrassed for you when you goof around like this.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I get embarrassed for you when you say you like something that is obviously real bad because  there's going to be people out there that go, and Jim Norton thinks this is funny.  I do, actually.  This is well, right?  No, you don't.  Let's hear some of the rap and Duke.  Yeah, this is Sean Brown, everybody.  Okay, cool.  It's the rap and Duke. 
[02:57:00]  So you think you're bad with your rap?  Well, I'll tell you, Pilgrim, I started the crap when you were in diapers and wetting the  sheets.  I was at the Ponderosa rapping to the beat.  Da, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Sure, I rustle some cowl and tin it at the sheep, but my main concern was rapping to the beat.  I don't bother nobody. 
[02:57:30]  I'm a real nice guy.  Kind of laid back like a dead fly.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  Why is he doing that?  Why aren't you doing the da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha?  No, I can't.  Did Duke talk like that?  No, I don't think you did.  I'm talking here and now.  Later for the cattle and rustle and the cowl.  If I had a chance to do a repeat, you can bet your sweet forgive me.  I'd be rapping to the beat.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha. 
[02:58:00]  Do you think like when he did this live, the whole crowd did this?  Yeah, I hope so.  The whole crowd did it.  Why are you talking over the best part?  Yeah, I know.  Everybody, next time around.  200 punks, well, what you gonna do?  I got two sick shooters that'll see me through.  That's 12 dead and 188 ballbears.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  What I do on your grave won't pass for flowers either. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, I guess you're gonna piss off.  Curtis Bull Run DMC, you haven't heard a rap till you haven't heard it from me.  Bitch Moss checking in for Washington.  What about rapping Ronald Reagan?  Can we find that one?  That's up on YouTube.  Is there rapping Ronnie Reagan?  We'll play that one after the break.  Barry Sobel's bit.  We can't find it.  No?  I don't know, or can we?  I don't know, we'll figure it out after the break.  How's that sound?  Rich Voss, Caroline's next weekend, right?  Yeah.  You want gay guys to what?  No, I'm not. 
[02:59:00]  What do you want them to do?  Huh?  Send you some chicken wings or something backstage and that's the sign?  Like what?  Let's set it up now for you.  Let's just set it up for you now.  No.  A certain color shirt in the audience, what do you need?  What do you need from us?  A handkerchief.  A hot dog with just a little chili on one end.  Right.  Oh.  Come on, you've been giving us good radio.  The least we can do is help you out here.  No, that's.  Make sure Bonnie's home.  What do you need? 
[02:59:30]  No.  He's got to have definitely no gut.  I mean, if you were the guy without a gut.  Oh, no gut.  So when Voss is sucking cock, please, no gut.  No gut.  Because Voss prefers cut.  What else we learn?  He likes Atlanta guys.  No.  Specifically.  Voss likes to look up while he's blowing someone and run his hand over the smooth abs up to their nipples.  And he takes his little fingers and he probably runs on their nipples.  My hands don't reach his nipples.  Dark hair. 
[03:00:00]  5'5".  Why 5'5"?  5'5".  You've got to be smaller than me.  I've got to be the man in the real age.  You want a little short midget.  5'6".  Do you want to be blowing?  So he likes Mexicans.  No.  No Mexicans.  No.  No darkies.  Do you want to be blowing them and like have them push it and like your mouth puffs out with it?  You go.  Jesus, you're like a method.  A little snot bubble would blow.  Look at his face. 
[03:00:30]  Boss, you've got to start coming in every day.  Just every day.  We can't pay you.  We can't pay you.  You start coming in every day.  Oh, is that good?  All right.  Why don't we...  Butcha has an E-Rock song?  Mm-hmm.  Is he rapping?  Sure is.  With members of Eiffel and Robbers?  Wrapping, Butcha.  What is this? 
[03:01:00]  I think that's him just trying to give props to his homies who helped him with the rap.  It's the E-Rocktober rap?  Yeah.  Can we do some more E-Rocktober today?  What do we have laying around for E-Rocktober?  What the fuck?  We've got plenty of what the Fs.  Is Renee here today to read a what the F?  Yeah.  She also found something that was really funny on the internet that I'm excited for her to  bring in.  For what?  Well, she has her own bit with what she thinks is funny.  All right.  So let's have Renee do her bit and also read What the Fuck from E-Rock for E-Rocktober. 
[03:01:30]  Okay.  Here's Butcha's E-Rocktober song.  Yes, Rich Voss?  I don't...  I'll have to hear what I'll say.  All right.  What?  Bobby's getting married tonight on a...  It's on a...  What do you call it?  Isn't tonight...  Yeah.  Pretend.  He's getting married on a...  Yep.  He can go to his wedding on something. 
[03:02:00]  I think it's on the internet.  Yeah.  Yeah, tonight.  Yeah, you're in Hawaii.  I forgot about that.  Now you've got it.  You want someone to pick that up?  Yes.  Immediately.  That cock-sucking bit is hilarious.  What?  You.  This now?  This fucking guy from Atlanta.  And I was fucking with him.  He emails you back.  You fucked him?  No.  But he kept emailing me.  I go, look, pal.  You know?  Then he goes, oh, you're gay, bitch.  Because I said I'm not going to fuck you.  And then...  How far did you take him before you told him no? 
[03:02:30]  No.  I just said, you know, cut or uncut.  But then he writes...  And I go, look, I'm married.  I got a kid.  You know?  Then he writes...  I'm telling the whole gay community...  What?  Oh, you're really going to get on a loudspeaker?  You let him on, dude.  Huh?  Yeah, you let him on.  You let him on.  You let the gay guy.  He's wrong.  And now you're bummed that he's...  Now you're bummed that he's going to tell the whole gay community.  He's warning them you're a cocktease.  Don't talk to that boss.  He's a pig collector.  I don't want to be known as a cocktease in the gay community. 
[03:03:00]  You're like a little vixen.  So did that bother you?  What?  Did he email?  That he was going to tell the whole community?  No, it bothered me that there's so fucking...  Anytime you reject or say anything negative, not even negative, to a gay guy, it's gay bashing.  I wouldn't bash him once.  I didn't say faggot or I didn't call him anything.  I just said, it's not going to happen.  All right?  Well, why would you say cut or uncut?  I go, well, I'm a comic.  All right?  I didn't...  You know, it's just like saying bottom or top. 
[03:03:30]  All right?  You always say that.  How many times on the radio do you go?  But why would you say cut or uncut?  Is that the question to ask?  Right.  Because I'm wondering if you write back cut or uncut and he writes back uncut.  I can go to all the emails on MySpace and see, you know, you got all of them.  But why would you even toy with a guy?  Yeah.  I must have gotten like thousands of emails on MySpace and stuff that I just don't answer.  Whether they're sexual or just like stupid questions, you just delete them. 
[03:04:00]  Why would you even entertain...  I'm fucking wrongly.  I fight with these people.  But if I...  You go cut or uncut.  That's a normal question to ask a gay guy.  If I delete message...  If I realize in an email exchange that there was some gay thing going on, I would just write  back...  Ah!  Then you write cut, uncut.  Cut, uncut.  I mean, how do you type?  Ah!  A with a bunch of ages.  An exclamation point.  I'm coming over your house, Rich. 
[03:04:30]  I know where you live.  Da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  This song's horrible.  How much time?  Four minutes?  That's funny, Rich.  That's really funny.  So we're going to play Butcher doing the E-Rock rap.  Why are you putting your headphones on? 
[03:05:00]  Because everybody else...  Because everybody else did.  I just want to be part of the club.  If everybody jumped off a bridge, would you suck a cock?  No.  All right.  You guys want to hear the Butcher rap?  Oh, my God.  Did you tell him for PC?  Oh, he knows.  Wait.  What happened?  Better.  What happened?  I got to get the big orange box today.  Big orange box.  It's Half-Life 2.  Oh, nice.  Episode 2.  And Portal.  And Team Fortress 2. 
[03:05:30]  Do you want to say what you were saying during the break?  You're psyched.  What was I saying?  About what?  About the cut or uncut?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course you're going to...  If somebody emails you and they're hitting on you, you're going to toy with them a little  maybe?  No, no, no.  Not that, but what you were saying, but you know, what you would say to them, why?  I would say, when he emailed me, I'd go cut or uncut.  Or would you go bottom or top?  You would just say, you know, you got to...  I'm a comic.  I know the language.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but you don't have to be a comic when you're like... 
[03:06:00]  Of anything, huh?  The language of gay?  Yeah.  Not of gay.  I mean, just, you know, just...  Wait.  How is it...  You said, I'm a comic.  I know the language.  What does that mean?  Well, that's how you would respond.  Can't, like, a truck driver know the language of the gay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you have to be a comic to know the language?  I don't get it.  Okay, okay.  Maybe that was the wrong analogy or comparison.  That wasn't either.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha. 
[03:06:30]  I can go to MySpace and find the whole conversation.  All right, we'll do that.  All right, let's play Butch's E-Rocktober rap.  That's a nice feature.  Or...  I hate these new CD players, by the way, if Don Wickland's listening.  They don't play.  No, they don't play.  It's E-Rock!  It's E-Rock! 
[03:07:00]  It's E-Rock!  It's E-Rock!  Get ripped apart for every show he damages  Distracted by his love for bologna sandwiches  Outstanding lateness, failing every challenge  Hayden, I was bangin' to eat mayonnaise by the gallon  Eat rocks!  Eat rocks!  Eat rocks!  It's Eat Rocks over!  How did someone puke so much and be so fat? 
[03:07:30]  Exactly what the F is up with that?  Might be dumb as hell, but he's one of the best  So don't ever judge a man by the size of his breast  Eat rocks!  Eat rocks!  Eat rocks!  It's Eat Rocks over!  Eat rocks over!  Eat rocks over! 
[03:08:00]  Eat rocks!  Eat rocks over!  Yeah!  I like it, yeah!  It's alright, man!  I like it!  Good job, Butcher!  It, uh...  What happened?  Rocks!  Uh, Anthony?  Dr. Steve checking in.  I'll see you on Team Fortress tonight.  Are you cut or uncut?  Uh, cut!  Anthony's clipped.  Who's not clipped here?  Gotta be, uh...  Rich clipped?  Oh, of course.  I don't know.  Be able to keep nice and tidy clean.  It's all good. 
[03:08:30]  Clipped and bumped.  It's all good.  What?  Clipped and bumped.  Those little cauliflower things that grow off the side?  Cauliflower?  What do you call warts?  Jesus Christ.  What?  You don't want to describe anything with cauliflower.  When you're talking about your cock.  They're like ticklers.  Built-in ticklers.  What?  You got fucking warts.  No, I don't.  I've got warts. 
[03:09:00]  No, I don't.  A warning to all the gay guys out there.  I've got warts.  I don't have warts.  Just let him suck your cock.  Don't go near his.  Right.  No reciprocating.  Well, that's what you wouldn't want to do.  I mean, if you were going to do it with a guy, you can get a girl to do that.  You can get a collie.  Watch his cock.  Looks like the fucking tiki.  From Brady Bunch.  A lot of people saying the song is...  No, see, that fucking song rules.  That fucking song is awful. 
[03:09:30]  That's what you get no matter what we do on this radio show.  Dave in Tennessee.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Keep Rich talking.  I think he's about 10 minutes away from coming out.  You don't need to know all this stuff to be a comic, Rich.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need to know everything.  How bored are you on the road that you're having a cut, uncut discussion on email?  Yeah, with somebody that you should just, like, delete the message.  Punching out, right?  You know, first of all, if you delete all your messages, Dane Cook got so big because  he didn't delete his messages, okay? 
[03:10:00]  You got to answer your fans, okay?  You can't be prejudiced and go, well, he's gay.  I'm not going to answer him.  Flipped or uncut.  You know, so you're right, and, you know, you try to get him...  I said to him, he goes, when are you going to be in Atlanta?  And I, you know...  And he said, look at my website for all my tour dates.  No, I told him to date.  And, you know, if you're close to any of these cities, you know,  I'll fly in.  No, I'm paying.  No, I'm not paying, see?  All right, so at least he admits he does suck cock.  He's just not going to fly you in.  I got to add this to the fucking resume. 
[03:10:30]  It's a profile, not a resume.  I'm a profile.  Thank you, Rich.  I'm not trying to get a job at the ramrod.  So you're a cheap cocksucker.  You're not going to fly any of these guys into the city you're performing in?  No.  No.  Fucking cheap.  All right, we're going to take a break.  You are cheap.  You've really grossed out a lot of people answering feedback with the cauliflower line.  You've got cauliflower bumps on the side of your penis.  Danny, you got cauliflower bumps on the side of your penis?  No. 
[03:11:00]  Danny has it on his liver.  Oh, dice wrapping?  Is this good?  Well, good as in terrible, yeah.  All right, we'll do that next.  Did you know that Dice wrapped back in the day?  Wait, is that when he was the Boogaloo Galoos song?  No, it was way before that.  This is really old.  Oh, I don't know what it is.  You got to give it to him for Boogaloo Galoos.  I'm over here now.  I kind of like that one.  Yeah.  This completely predates that.  The footage looked like it was from like maybe 87.  Oh, wow.  I need that on my machine for tomorrow, E-Rock. 
[03:11:30]  All right?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is inside us.  OEvirus.com  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just passed.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone. 
[03:12:00]  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly,  the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus. 
[03:12:30]  Spread the virus.  The Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Oh, it's not Tuesday.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, back from L.A.  Have you seen the YouTube video of Anthony falling asleep?  No.  We haven't talked to Jimmy since the famous incident of you falling asleep in the studio. 
[03:13:00]  I thought I was just rolling my chair around, hitting the walls, and banging into the console to wake up.  Wake up.  Yeah, I fell asleep, Jimmy.  He knows.  We all know.  Yeah.  I know.  I was sleepy.  You expected Jimmy to go, really?  I thought you were just a little tired.  I was sleepy.  I went out.  Rich, did you know that?  No.  Anthony fell asleep for 40 minutes.  For 40 minutes?  It wasn't that long. 
[03:13:30]  It gets longer and longer every time the story is told.  It was about 20 minutes.  I'm still...  No, I've said 40 since the...  No, it was 20 minutes.  What's your impression of sleeping and snoring?  How do you do it when you're...  No, this was nothing.  I was out.  I did...  Here was my mistake.  It was a couple of mistakes.  I...  Thursday, I stayed in the city because I was going to go out Thursday night.  So I made a point of staying in the city, going to sleep right when I left the show, 
[03:14:00]  and waking up to go out.  And then I figured I could go out, stay out late, and be okay for the show.  I was okay until we got over here, and then about an hour before the show was going to end,  and I started feeling it, and we had a lot of people in here, and Francine's sitting in that chair,  way back there, and I just go like this.  I pull the mic over here, I pop my feet up over here, and lean back, like this.  And before I knew it, I was like this. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Fucking out.  I bet you Roger Clemens said the exact same thing.  I was fully prepared to pitch.  Yeah, and then...  I rested, I was eating right, taking care of myself.  And not even like at that point where...  Because I've seen you nod off, I've seen Patrice nod off,  and the second we start going, what should we do to me?  Like you kind of stir and wake up and fuck the whole thing up.  There was nothing waking me up. 
[03:15:00]  Nothing.  So I just got...  I got...  They put classical music on, zoomed the Paltalk camera in on me,  so that they could...  Yeah, there it is.  There I am.  Oh, now the video's up on Foundry music?  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, this is embarrassing.  Wait, I'm going to argue this 25 minutes.  How many minutes is this video?  Because you were out way before they started filming you, buddy.  Well, pretty soon the stopwatch will come on if it's on Foundry. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know, where's the clock?  Yeah, it was 25 minutes from when Ope said to Drew Curtis that he was boring Anthony.  Oh, am I...  Look how tired I am.  No, you're asleep.  I know.  I'm tired right now.  I'm exhausted.  But you're asleep.  I was asleep.  That is...  I didn't know that this video was up on Foundry music.  Awesome.  Also break.  So, hundreds of people.  Wait, is it on the front page of break? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, that's funny.  There's 25 minutes?  Is this on the front page of break?  I'm not sure.  Oh, my God.  Steve should be able to...  Do you want this on the front page of break?  We can get this on the front page of break.  Oh, there I go.  I'm stirring.  Here, let's...  That was 25 minutes or so?  That was 25 minutes or so?  That was 25 minutes.  Hey, an echo.  Oh, that didn't work.  Oh, there we go.  Look.  Now, I open my eyes.  I look around.  Now, I don't know where I am.  That's how my grandma used to wake up.  I was like, where am I?  Because now there's music in my ears, so I'm smiling because I remember what happened. 
[03:16:30]  Now he's shaking his head.  Now I'm all like, oh, shit.  As you're shaking your head, though, I'm convinced you still really aren't...  You don't really know what's going on.  You're not sure if you're on the air.  You're looking around like, oh, please.  I'm looking like, what?  Oh, please.  Please, I'm not on the air.  Because I had no idea how long I was asleep, where everyone went.  And now I'm kind of looking around like, I really am trying to get my bearings here.  Now I'm pissed.  I know it's been about a half hour. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, that's bad.  Yeah, our new bit, Wake Up Your Radio Host Friday.  Yeah, so I just, I crapped right out, man.  That's it.  Can't fucking...  How's your narcoleptic impression?  Oh, and then I thought it would be a good idea to have me do a live read with some copy.  After waking up.  Right when I woke up.  As soon as you woke up, right.  I was just out of it.  All right.  There you go.  Oh, was that the Hawaiian thing?  No, I just...  Now I just, at breaks, knock myself around in this chair. 
[03:17:30]  You look like a security guard or a tollboot collector sleeping.  Yeah, I know.  Anyone else can sleep on the job.  In radio, it's a little rough.  They expect to hear from you.  All right, here we go.  So you can find that on foundrymusic.com.  Opie and anthony.com has it?  Uh-huh.  Break.com has it?  Yes.  I know some people have made YouTube videos of Anthony falling asleep.  I'm a hit.  You go there to check that out.  It's not a Vista hit, but it's up there.  Nah, Vista was my big one.  It's getting some nice views.  Vista was my Sergeant Peppers.  I don't know how to follow that up.  My stairway, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  I don't know how to follow that up.  All right.  We got Miss Hawaii, some pageant contestant from Hawaii.  I don't know how old she is, but she's kind of young.  And she had this to say.  Or did she?  No, you know what?  They really got to fix the fucking CD players.  I love the new studio, blah, blah, blah.  But fix the CD players.  Really?  And I'll explain to Don because he's listening.  You put the CD in, right?  It should fire right off the board. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  The second you hit the button, what we have to do is put the CD in, and then for some  reason push stop on the CD player, even though it's not playing yet, and then we could fire  it off the board.  Take note and fix.  Nadine Tanega.  I am especially proud to be a first-generation American and a resident of Hawaii, our youngest  state.  Hawaii.  Our nation's pride lies deep within the hearts of its...  By the way, so...  Everyone knows it's Hawaii.  Yeah.  Stop with the Hawaii. 
[03:19:00]  By the way, so far, so good.  She started off strong, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Listen to the wheels just falling off.  Nadine Tanega.  What do you call her?  I am especially proud to be a first-generation American and a resident of Hawaii, our youngest  state.  Our nation's pride lies deep within the hearts of its people.  American has faith in the liberty and justice, and we all have faith and believe in ourselves.  The United States' freedom and opportunity is one of the greatest. 
[03:19:30]  We are truly the land of the great.  From the rocky shores of Hawaii to the beautiful sandy beaches of Hawaii, America is our home.  The wonderfully versatile state you have there.  Well, well said.  Well said.  No.  From Hawaii to Hawaii. 
[03:20:00]  Great.  That's a small-ass country, you dummy.  Enough about Hawaii!  Right now, that's right.  You must have hated Hawaii.  Right.  Hey, by the way, use Ladbag from Whackbag in Boston there.  You have to mention CokeLogic's video of Vance sleeping with the Bob Newhart ending where  he wakes up and he's in his Apollo van.  Have you seen this yet?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that one.  Is it good?  I haven't seen that yet.  That one's good.  It shows me falling asleep and then waking up in the Apollo van.  Is that linked up on all the websites, I'm sure? 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  Is it good?  Yeah, I still have those dreams in real life where I go to sleep and I dream that I'm working.  I'm doing radio, but I'm also, I have to go to work for Apollo air conditioning.  And I go in and get the truck, and then as I'm doing some work, I say to myself, why  am I doing this?  I'm like, why don't I quit this job?  I don't know what that means.  Mine is, I'm still in college.  Is that it?  Not too far from the truth.  Well, because it's recent memory is what it is. 
[03:21:00]  And I'm missing final exams and all that crap.  Dreams are never like really, it's always something screwing up.  Right.  Voss, do you ever get to suck that cock in your dream?  No, my dream is my legs grow three more inches.  Dangles inches from my face and I wake up disappointed.  All night long, it's right there in arm's reach and I can't get to it.  He's like in those stocks, medieval stocks.  Right.  And his mouth is straining.  Just come closer. 
[03:21:30]  And I end up getting really close.  But then I realize I'm waking up and now I'm just running in a forest.  I'm like, oh, don't wake up.  Don't wake up.  I need to fuck that cock.  My dream is one of Otto's bits.  I love getting Rich Voss to say, ew.  By the way, dude, you had a great summer.  I know we're beating the shit out of you, but you had a great summer on the virus tour.  It was a lot of fun.  You really, really, really did. 
[03:22:00]  Thanks.  Yes, I am 28.  How did you know that, Klaus Kinski Jr. from Fall River, Massachusetts?  Someone's saying it's Cigars and Scotch that did the animation.  Oh, you're giving credit where it is not due.  I was just reading Instant Feedback.  I haven't seen that one yet.  I'll check it out tonight.  I'll check it out as soon as we get off the air.  All right, did you want to do the dice wrapping? 
[03:22:30]  I need a new CD cover, an idea for a CD cover.  Cover is not the problem.  No, I got the CD cover.  It lies right underneath it.  That's what someone told me to do.  Huh?  Hold on.  I wrote the word.  No.  Voss, forget it.  Sorry, sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I forget the word.  There's a word that's vocitious or something. 
[03:23:00]  Vocitious or voc...  You ever hear the word?  I have it written down in the car.  All right, why don't you...  Yeah, why don't you...  Yeah, because now I want to know what the fuck word you just took...  It means...  ...and sliced into chops.  Vociferously?  Yeah, vociferous.  How did you know that?  Because I'm not a retard.  Do you know what it means?  What does vociferous mean?  It means fucking midget body, but slightly taller.  That's what it means.  No, it means...  That has sucked a cock or two.  No, a cock or two.  A cock or two. 
[03:23:30]  Vociferous.  Yeah.  It means, like, in-your-face, outgoing type.  Yeah.  So he wants me...  Well, what would be in-your-face, ingoing?  Outgoing.  To be vociferous.  It's vociferous or something?  It's just another cock joke, Rich.  Oh.  I don't know.  I'm still amazed that he was able to pull his fucking wallet out between the short arms and  being a Jew.  You shouldn't be amazed, though.  It's because he's sitting down.  We already figured that out.  That's true, yeah.  He can get it to his pockets if he's sitting down.  Why is boy George out there now? 
[03:24:00]  What?  Hey, what happened to Renee coming in with what she thinks is funny in her E-Rocktober bit  for today?  Oh, that's...  What's her name there?  Andrea.  Hi.  Andrea, the horrible cook.  Oh, I thought that was boy George.  She makes the worst...  She makes the worst everything.  She's hard at baking and stuff.  Hi, Renee.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Good.  What's up?  Hello, Renee.  Oh, nothing much.  What's wrong?  Having a good day?  I didn't expect to come on, so I'm a little...  Oh.  ...ruffled. 
[03:24:30]  No, I was...  Is that a problem?  Nothing to plug?  That's the topsy-turvy world radio there.  There you go.  You know, you never know.  You got to be ready all the time.  That's right.  One minute you're wearing a railroad hat employee.  A railroad employee hat.  I'm tired.  A railroad hat employee.  That's funny.  It's...  The person that stitches the railroad hat is sitting on her head.  That's got to be heavier than a railroad hat employee.  That's got to be heavier than a shit hat.  It's raining out. 
[03:25:00]  I really didn't feel like putting my hair up or whatever, so I just threw it out, and  I didn't care.  Yeah.  So what do you got today?  All right.  I got some more what the fucks.  This is the E-Rock bit for E-Rocktober.  It's E-Rocktober.  Yeah.  All right.  What the fuck is with SpaghettiOs?  What the deal is with the sauce?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can you...  Am I still going?  You're fucking up is what the fuck.  Didn't we do the SpaghettiOs one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't know we did SpaghettiOs.  I'm sorry.  That's cool.  But it's one she likes.  She could redo it.  All right.  Yeah.  No, we don't have to.  No, we'll redo it.  Oh, and a lot of people didn't hear it. 
[03:25:30]  They're timeless anyway.  Yeah, they are timeless.  Let me get this in first.  E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  Thank you, Eric, for totally ruining the show.  All right.  There you go.  Now, what the fuck?  Hold on.  I totally lost that one.  I lost it.  Is that...  What's that?  No, the shit fight.  It's over there.  No, it was the other page.  Oh, this is real good. 
[03:26:00]  Here we go.  I'm sorry about that.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  What the fuck is with SpaghettiOs?  What's the deal with the sauce?  SpaghettiOs.  There's three versions of SpaghettiOs, plain, hot dogs, and meatballs.  All three have a different sauce.  Plain's a bit bland on the bland side and thin in texture.  Hot dog is very thin, but mildly spicy.  Meatballs is this thick, rich sauce which fills you up before you can even finish the can.  Make a note of it.  What the fuck? 
[03:26:30]  Because it's about food and he's always eating.  Why is that a what the fuck?  I don't...  Wow, who would think the heavier sauce that has meat in it would be the one that fills  you up faster?  What the fuck?  Finish the whole can.  Like, I just picture you eating it out of the can.  Did you notice that this fucking fat-necked idiot didn't notice one political point?  Not one social point.  It's fucking...  It's fucking...  What a dumb motherfucker.  It's SpaghettiO sauces. 
[03:27:00]  And fucking lollipop flavors.  Lollipop.  Do you ever notice when a magician makes you a dog out of a balloon, it doesn't bark loud?  You fucking idiot.  All right, uh...  Listen to this, Renee.  Okay.  Renee is...  How would you put it, Matt?  She sucks.  Well, I mean, that's...  No.  Well, you have the history with her, so you know better than anyone else in this entire  place.  Oh, you mean just you and I here? 
[03:27:30]  I do have a history with Renee, but I do not want to go into it.  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  What do you think, Renee, about our history?  I'm not going down that road.  And apparently she...  I don't believe I don't give a shit.  No, because Renee's a tough cook.  Right.  Did you know that what Renee finds funny is generally awful?  But, according to her...  I'm not that bad.  No.  Oh, man.  I just feel like I could go through these all day. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  You have nothing better to talk about me?  I appreciate that.  Wow.  There's Pat Tuffy.  That's whose voice you were hearing on that podcast.  What's up, Pat?  That was a podcast?  Oh, I thought it was like a hidden microphone somewhere.  Oh, it was kind of...  Well, it sort of was, yeah.  A little of both.  What's up, Pat?  What's going on?  Did you know we had a copy of that?  No.  I thought that was gone and buried.  Is that your radio partner over there, Matt? 
[03:28:30]  Yes.  Hi.  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  How long have you been with us?  Since June.  Oh, shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  No way.  Yeah.  I have never seen you.  Did you go get my bagel this morning?  Yes, I did.  You are a fucking idiot.  I said, let me tell you how dumb you are.  And I was like, listen.  I said a bagel with cucumbers, right?  It's a bagel with cream cheese.  He comes back with a bagel, cream cheese, and a big box of cucumbers.  Like, I didn't want, like, a fucking farm's worth of cucumbers. 
[03:29:00]  I wanted a couple slices on my bagel.  If you can't get a bagel right, how do you think you're going to make it in life?  Think about it.  Me and Ant are looking at each other because who gets cucumbers on a bagel?  On a bagel.  On a bagel.  Cream cheese.  It is the dumbest thing.  First of all, it's Canadian.  And maybe if you had some Canadian knowledge that you would, I didn't like each other.  Canadian knowledge.  Why don't you start slow with just earth knowledge?  Okay.  Exactly.  Some basic knowledge of the planet itself.  Before you get specific, why don't you just have knowledge of breathing? 
[03:29:30]  Don't, listen.  I'm the victim.  Don't attack the victim.  He's the one who fucked up my order.  I'm going to defend him for a second.  Okay.  If you order a bagel with cream cheese and cucumbers, you better fucking damn well explain  that you want them sliced on the bagel.  Oh, okay.  How about if I ordered a bagel and lox?  Would he come with a fucking salmon?  He might.  Probably two master lox.  Bagel and master lox.  You just figure with all the cock you suck, that he would just give you a whole cucumber 
[03:30:00]  to shove up your ass, you homo.  You know, have some on your bagel, save the rest for your ass.  It's the first time they'll ever stick up for a new intern because it's me they're attacking.  Yeah.  First of all.  You fucked up.  It's a fuck up, right?  Well, yeah, that was kind of a fuck up.  No, it's not because we're in America.  We don't know how you're supposed to fucking put cucumbers on a bagel.  People eat cucumbers on a bagel and cream cheese and it's going to try.  You're the first.  Dude, I've never heard of it.  I've been on this planet 32 years. 
[03:30:30]  I'm looking over here.  I don't see one person saying, yeah, yeah.  People are going, no, they don't.  Try it.  Voss is an asshole.  No, you're not saying that.  Fuck Voss.  Fuck Voss.  Voss is a shithead.  I wish Voss would drop dead.  That's nice.  Fuck Voss.  That's all Voss's subconscious thoughts.  It's called a cucumber sandwich.  That's a good one.  Dude, we could take phone calls.  What do you like on your bagel?  That wouldn't come in one at all.  No, you're wrong.  Not a one. 
[03:31:00]  Okay, I bet you try it.  You'll like it.  Cucumber.  All right.  What do you like on your bagel?  Hey, here we go.  What's your favorite thing to put out a bagel?  By the way, good observation from the boys.  Matt looks like the agent midget from Entourage.  Holy shit, do you?  You'd look like that guy if he wasn't a midget.  There's a picture over there, man, to the right there, from Entourage, that guy.  Oh, yeah, okay.  How could he be a cool midget?  That guy's like a cool midget.  He's got a leather jacket on. 
[03:31:30]  He's got attitude.  Got the goatee.  Yeah.  But when you get to those little fat fucking upper legs.  That's it.  They look like arms.  Over.  Baby arm legs.  Like he can't chase anyone.  Just cool.  Like cool guy can go into chase mode, chase someone down for the honor of a girl or something  or to thwart a crime.  Once a midget starts running, the only hope is that the criminal or bad guy or whatever  will just laugh until he can't run anymore, watching those little legs rolling around. 
[03:32:00]  He had a famous chase scene in the Will Ferrell movie there, the elf, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  He was the one that ran across the long table in the boardroom.  Oh.  Just give him a charley horse and then go, now what?  Now what?  Midgets have made such a resurgence on television and in the movies.  For a while there, we just didn't want to see him anymore.  For a while, they were all over the place.  Right.  All over.  You walk around, you're stepping on them. 
[03:32:30]  Back in when I was a kid.  And then they just went away.  Like people decided the second they found out they were going to have one, the old hanger  came out, and you'd make a little mobile out of it.  There was one midget that didn't get the Wizard of Oz.  How depressing was that?  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  It was the leftovers from the Wizard of Oz when I was growing up.  One guy had to watch all his friends in the Wizard of Oz.  I came this close.  I saw a special on midgets and fucking, it was a midget married like a tall lady, and 
[03:33:00]  they fucked and had a baby, and the baby was a midget.  And I'm just thinking, there's no way we don't know who to blame for this.  It's almost like if two parents have a kid who's retarded or whatever, that just happens.  Yeah.  When one parent's a midget, and you fuck a tall lady, and the kid comes out a midget,  dad blasted.  We know whose fault that is.  Your fault.  Yep.  You know.  Rotten little jeans.  You know what sucks?  These guys were this close to having a great segment on the Opie and Anthony show.  Sorry, guys.  Oh, and we just like stepped all over them. 
[03:33:30]  The Matt and Pat Duffy radio show.  What do they do, a podcast?  Yeah, but Pat Duffy, you thought you had the only copy, and you threw it out the window  on the way home?  I did.  Why would you do that for a podcast?  It seems like it's your resume, almost.  I was embarrassed by its content.  The entire content?  Well, Sam and those guys kind of ran in the beginning, and Sam's got the ability to kill  all of my confidence, so I just said...  Why Sam?  I don't know.  Just for some reason, but he just killed all my confidence for the rest of it, and I 
[03:34:00]  just wasn't proud of it, so I just tossed it.  We have more of it?  Oh, we got tons.  Wow.  Did you not talk into the mic on that show as well?  Oh, sorry.  Fucking fan, man.  That's fantastic.  I know that.  Most people just go, talk to the mic.  Yeah.  I tried that.  Let's go to Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Love that.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What's up, Jason?  Oh, no.  I just want to tell Rich Voss.  He's an ass.  Thank you.  I work for a bagel store. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, brother.  A single person ever came in asking for cucumbers.  No one ever did that?  Never.  The guy works in a bagel store, see?  No, I've never seen it.  I'm not even.  How good is your bagel store if you're not making bagels at quarter to 11?  That's what?  No one's coming into your bagel store.  I made him last night, smart guy.  And if you really want to find out-  I'm a smart guy?  You're fucking making bagels.  How dare you come here?  Shut up.  No one's ever asked for a bagel with cucumbers and cream cheese?  You don't even-  No, because they all have normal size hands. 
[03:35:00]  Dude, I bet you don't even have cucumbers in the place.  No, we don't.  Why would you need them?  Exactly.  Listen, okay.  I'm sorry.  I tried it.  It was good.  Okay?  And that's why the guy downstairs that ran the place didn't put the cucumbers on the bagels.  Let's talk about the people that said satellite radio wouldn't work.  Shut up, okay?  Or HBO wouldn't work.  Go fuck yourself.  He's now comparing a bagel and cucumbers to satellite radio and cable television.  That's because satellite radios are more commonly found on bagels than fucking cucumbers are. 
[03:35:30]  I would sooner say, give me a fucking-  Give me an everything with an XM portable on it than I would cucumbers.  You got to stay away from these serious bagels, though,  because too many calories.  Yes, they're very big.  Big radios over there.  Oh, Rich.  I don't like water.  How many of those do you get those often?  Rich.  They're good.  Did Bonnie turn you on to it?  Do you ever have bagel, cream cheese, and tomato? 
[03:36:00]  With lox, whatever, or salmon.  I mean, it's more common, probably.  I haven't, but people, you would eat a sandwich like that.  Rich, what do you like better, a bagel or like a-  A cock.  No, like a hot dog.  I don't-  He has to cut a bagel in half just so it doesn't look like a pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm amazed that you actually like a food that sort of looks like a pussy.  I get bagel sticks.  Yes, you're odd to me.  I was doing that bit, yes. 
[03:36:30]  That's exactly what I was doing.  Well, the only way to get-  I was going to go with a crawler.  What gave it away was-  And I was tricked you.  What gave it away, doctor, is you picked up your pen and started writing your profile as you were asking.  I couldn't wait to add to this profile.  All right, we'll do your podcast another day, Pat Duffy.  Okay.  But what happened was, on the way home, you threw out the only copy, and then you realized  that these douches recorded it secretly, right?  Oh, that's- I kind of had a feeling they did.  Is it bad, though? 
[03:37:00]  Sam's listening to it.  Sam?  Sam?  I like it.  Sam.  Sam likes things because they make other people look bad.  That's how Sam feels better about himself, by making other people feel lousy.  When you hear that Sam likes something, yeah, exactly what Ant said.  It's because someone else is suffering.  Well, some of it was just a little inside.  Like what?  Oh, talking about interns that haven't even been brought up on this show yet.  Um, and they also didn't realize that just because you turn off audition in their studio 
[03:37:30]  but not the mics, doesn't mean that the mics are no longer recording anywhere else.  Oh.  So, Pat gives Matt a pep talk while he thinks the mics are off?  All right, wait a minute.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Do I have headphones?  All right.  Here we go.  Huh?  Track five.  Keep it open.  All right, gosh.  I'm going to push stops.  I'm going to push play on the board.  Nothing better than when people think the mics are off. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Ready?  Ready?  I think so.  Yeah, we're not good.  Get better, though, Matt.  Sure.  That's the thing.  All right.  Get better.  I've been searching for a partner.  I think I found him.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Now that I can't see you.  Hello, Matt.  Hi.  All right.  Can you hear me?  Yes.  I'm recording now, Matt.  Chemistry is magical.  Wow.  Looking for a partner?  I think I found him.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  This is just like when Ant and I got together.  Sounds like Jagger and Keith Richards in 1968.  Wow.  Plant Page has nothing on you guys.  Townsend and Daltry.  Right there, man.  It's getting better.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's getting better.  Yeah.  We suck.  Yeah, but it's getting better.  Been looking for a partner.  You've been looking for a partner for what?  You just fucking got on the mic.  True.  Yeah, man.  Oh, God.  It's been minutes.  Minutes I've been looking. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, like I was looking to do radio with someone for almost 10 years.  Right.  Yeah.  Matt Duffy, two minutes.  Two minutes of this on the air, boy.  Boy, I'm ready for the next step here.  Solo shoots for the birds, motherfucker.  I need a fucking ensemble cast.  And I eat the dog shit.  All right.  Track 11.  Why track 11?  Well, what gets really sad is that you realize that as into it as Pat Duffy is, Matt just doesn't 
[03:39:30]  show the same enthusiasm.  Okay.  It's the way it is, right?  With these.  Oh, yeah.  Even Ricky and Lucy had problems.  Yep.  So basically, we're going to hear Matt falling asleep on the air.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Hey, hi.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  Matt, I want you to have some confidence about your performance.  I don't fucking care. 
[03:40:00]  Matt, I wish you were a little more into this.  I'm going to end up being a cop anyway.  A cop?  I am honestly, dude.  I don't do this because you want to do it.  Like, I'm into it.  Don't get me wrong.  But like.  I'm fucking, man.  No.  I mean, I'm not going to go home and lose sleep over it.  I'm just letting you.  Because I know you are properly.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  This is the Rich Voss tape from Atlanta.  Wow.  It sounds like my marriage.  It sounds like you talking to the gay guy about, hey, I'll suck your cock, but I'm not 
[03:40:30]  really into this, you know.  That's an encouraging thing for your podcast.  Look, this is only a segue into the police academy.  What inspired you to want to be a cop?  That fucking pizza party story from Ohio?  Uh, no.  Nothing?  That was funny.  All right.  Nothing on the fucking pizza party massacre references?  I had to think about it for a second.  Maybe it wasn't that good.  So, can I play this clip again?  And I just want you to keep in mind that this could possibly be Rich Voss. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Talking about sucking that guy's cock in the land.  The guy's cock.  I'm going to let this go, Rich.  Just keep that in mind.  Matt, I want you to have some confidence about your performance.  Because I don't fucking care.  Matt, I wish you were a little more into it.  I'm going to end up being a cop anyway.  A cop?  Sorry.  I am.  Honestly, dude.  I'm doing this because you want to do it. 
[03:41:30]  Like, I'm into it.  Don't get me wrong.  But, like.  No.  I mean, I'm not going to go home  and we'll sleep over it.  I'm just then.  Because I know you are from.  All right.  Yeah, it does sound like, yeah.  Almost.  He's doing this because you're into it, man.  I'm really not.  Ow.  Ow.  I'm really not a cocksucker.  The guy has to actually pinch your nose.  And when he pinches your nose,  you're just going.  Matt, you want to be a cop  instead of do this radio crap?  I want to be a cop.  You idiot.  It's a steady paycheck. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, no shit.  I'm with you.  It's a lot of money.  Why are you interning at a radio station?  It's a lot of money.  Wait, wait.  Where do you want to be a cop?  Nassau.  Oh, okay.  It is, actually.  Nassau, they pay their boys well.  What's starting to pay?  50-something.  50-something goes to the club.  Yeah, five, I think.  Very hard to get in.  Yeah, I took the test  and I know some people.  They want some decent schooling  behind it, too.  And you know what I hear?  Pat really wants to do radio.  I can tell from these clips.  Yeah.  This guy is motivated.  Why'd you pick Matt as your radio guy? 
[03:42:30]  Because I feel like,  out of all the interns,  Matt and I are most like-minded.  What about Bon Jovi?  Fuck him.  Matt wants to be a cop.  You brush your teeth with shit.  Where's the like-mindedness?  Well, I was obviously mistaken.  Oh, yeah.  I'll give you a little advice.  Maybe pick someone  that's a little different than you.  Then you get a few different points of views.  Okay.  Sure.  I'm going to be nice  to a future Nassau cop.  Yeah, no kidding.  Hey, when you get out  of the academy and everything,  let me know. 
[03:43:00]  Give me a PBA card.  Use all the help I can get.  Thank you, sir.  Absolutely.  I'm going to give that guy  some respect now.  Not Pat Duffy.  Look at Pat.  Pat was like they were fucking  on the air for 20 years  and he was breaking up  the fucking act.  Jesus Christ.  I'm coming back.  We were doing great.  Well, speaking of that,  someone thought they were listening  to JV and Elvis audio.  Oh, yeah.  Linger Linger.  Yes. 
[03:43:30]  And now I'm going to over-pronunciate  because some ass doesn't like  when I say that,  so now you get it even worse.  Linger Linger.  Oh, fuck.  Go fuck yourself.  Sam, we got one more track  for everybody?  Yeah, just even more emphasis  about the fact that maybe  Matt doesn't see the potential  that this radio duo has.  All right.  Still trying.  Okay.  And you guys thought that  the only copy was gone, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, I knew it was recorded.  Oh, you did? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, you thought,  but you didn't know.  I had a very good inkling.  What happened?  Oh, alarms are going off.  What are you talking about?  It's my ring.  That's your phone ring?  Yeah, I like calls are urgent.  What, run to the bunker?  How are you?  Anthony, yes, Kumia.  Yes, that is me.  Who is this?  He's busy, bitch!  Calling from where? 
[03:44:30]  You're calling from XM Satellite Radio,  and what do you need to do?  What do you need to do?  Calling to reactivate my service.  XM fucking believe this?  XM sucks cock, you whore!  Wait, no,  don't pay no attention to that person.  I enjoy XM.  Fuck XM!  To tell you the truth,  I enjoy the service.  I only listen to Howard Stern,  you whore!  That's my friend.  He's got serious  and listens to the asshole Howard. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, excuse my language.  I only listen for the Opie and Anthony  and Ron and Fez show.  Fuck Opie and Anthony  and their fuckholes!  I'm sorry, I really...  Howard all the way,  you whore!  I'm sorry.  Please don't be offended.  He does this to me.  Yeah, because I'm an O&A fan.  He's just a stupid Howard fan.  He owns Sirius.  Oh, and they got their whole act  from Howard!  See?  You fucking whore!  I have to listen to this every day.  I'm so sorry.  When you fire those douchebags, 
[03:45:30]  I'll start listening to XM!  I'm so sorry.  Does she know anything  about Opie and Anthony?  I would.  Do you know about Opie and Anthony?  Do you listen?  Oh, you don't?  Yeah.  Has she heard that they're funny  or anything?  Oh, you know people  that like them, though?  Oh, good.  Good.  Oof.  Yeah, well, I know people  that like water, too.  What?  What's...  Sing about it.  An offer I could get away  three months for $14.95? 
[03:46:00]  What would...  What would you do if I...  See, that just proves  that Opie and Anthony are failing.  You gotta give away  the service for free.  They're not giving it away  for free.  They're not making those deals  for Sirius.  It's a deal that I can get.  Because Howard's the king  of all media, whore!  Oh, God, this guy...  I don't even know why  I'm still friends with him.  And we argue about this  all the time.  Um, $14 for three months?  Baba Booey! 
[03:46:30]  $4.99!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  All right, Baba Booey!  We get it.  It's 1985.  We get it.  Baba Booey!  Oh, God.  And this...  Howard Stern Peer!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  What about the...  Baba Booey!  I heard something  about a merger.  What if a merger  goes through?  Am I gonna still be able  to get the service?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Okay.  Yeah?  I...  I receive...  Continue to receive 
[03:47:00]  XM's.  And following the merger,  you still be...  And I could get O&A  and everything, right?  And Ron and Fez?  No, fuckhead!  When the merger goes through,  those assholes are gone!  He thinks that O&A  and Ron and Fez  are gonna get fired.  That's not keeping those fuckwads!  Because, uh...  Howard Stern rules!  All right, I know.  Shut up.  Let me finish the call,  at least.  God, I hate this...  Jerk.  Okay, so...  Now, what would I need  to sign up?  Cut!  What would I need  to sign up?  Cut!  What would...  Cut! 
[03:47:30]  It's...  Cut!  1495...  Cut!  For...  Stop it!  Cut!  For three months.  Hmm.  Ah, look what you have to do  to get people  to listen to that crap.  Yeah?  Okay.  Okay.  All right, all right.  No, you sold me.  I'll take it.  It's Eric Logan. 
[03:48:00]  Is...  That's...  Because that's who's paying.  Yeah, that's who pays.  He's my dad.  Oh, a credit or debit card.  Oh, could you call Eric Logan  and get it from him?  Do you know who...  Do you know Eric Logan?  How about Don Wickland?  He should be out  in front of the building  picking up papers  with a pointy stick  and putting him in a bag.  He should be, 
[03:48:30]  but he's making believe  he's people's bosses.  You might as well  slide your card  right up her ass.  Do you, um...  Because it's shit radio.  XM shit radio!  Shit radio!  Do you know who Eric Logan is?  How about you have a shit channel?  That's what that service is worth!  Have you heard of Eric Logan?  No.  Great.  No, you don't listen.  Where do you work out of?  Like, where are you  on the phone right now?  Iowa? 
[03:49:00]  Holy Jesus.  I thought you were in Washington.  No?  They, like, just sublet you out?  Wow.  At least it's not India.  Oh, man.  Why don't you ask her  why you should pick up  XM satellite radio?  Yeah, why should I get  XM satellite radio?  Yeah.  Leia, tell me a little bit.  Why?  What's the upside?  We all know Sirius has Howard.  What is XM?  All right.  Enough out of you.  Oprah! 
[03:49:30]  Fuck Oprah!  All right.  Ask her who the biggest act  on XM is.  What's the biggest  what's, like, the biggest  The big get.  The big get.  The big draw  for XM satellite radio.  What is it?  A lot of people like  the fact that there's no  commercials on the 61 channels  the music channels.  What about, like, like, like  Sirius has the same exact  channel, ass  and he also has Howard Stern.  All right.  Would you stop that?  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Is there, like, a big name? 
[03:50:00]  Baba Booey!  Is there a big name?  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  All right.  What's your Baba Booey?  Is there a big name on XM  that, like, I would hear and go,  oh, okay, I kind of want to listen to that?  What do you like?  What do you like?  Um, I like, like, you know,  talk radio.  I like what's it to Howard!  It's Howard TV!  Yeah, like...  Could you imagine having to deal  with this guy every day?  Like, if he likes Howard,  who is the competitor on XM?  My buddy likes Howard. 
[03:50:30]  Now, who does XM have  that would be comparable to that  that I would enjoy, maybe?  Probably Oprah!  Who?  That's all you've got!  Oprah?  So, Oprah would be like some...  Do you really, though,  think I would kind of like Oprah, though?  Really?  Really?  Hang up on this twat!  Serious is the only way to go!  I don't, you know,  everyone's different, 
[03:51:00]  but you know what I like?  I like kind of like  extreme talk kind of thing,  so what's, like,  the big extreme talk thing  you have on XM?  Like...  No?  I threw you off?  There is...  See, they don't even know  about your heroes,  Opie and Anthony!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Baba Booey!  Oh, you have the comedy channel? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  So there's comedy.  Do you listen to XM?  Serious has comedy, too!  Oh, when you're at work.  So what channel do you gotta...  What channel do you like?  Oh, calm music.  Yeah, because...  Yeah, you work for a company  that is gonna merge  and fire everybody. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  Why don't you tell them  about the discount, Harry?  Do you have the XM radio  near you right now?  Tell them about the discount, Harry.  Yeah, is it near you?  Or is somebody near the radio  right now?  Cashforgold.com!  Hold on two seconds.  What?  You don't have an XM right there?  Can you hear an XM  somewhere in the building? 
[03:52:30]  Oh, I want you to...  I want you to turn on 202.  Channel 202.  Yeah.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Why can't you do that?  You can't...  Oh, it's on the other side 
[03:53:00]  of the room  and they're not worth  getting up for  and going over there?  Did she say that?  No, she said it's  on the other side of the room.  So ask her to get up  and do it  because you want  to ask her something.  I'd like to ask you  something about them  and the only way  you really can  is if you listen  to them for a second.  So there's no way  you can get somebody  to put that on  or...  Well, I kind of...  I just want you to give  it a listen  for a couple of seconds 
[03:53:30]  so you're a little more  informed about  the talk radio part of it  so you can maybe tell me  like if that's kind of  what I would like,  that extreme talk thing.  So could you just  turn on 202, please?  Have somebody  just turn it on.  Okay?  Just find out...  I'll wait.  Find out what they're  talking about now.  Yeah, find out  what they're talking about  and let me know.  See if it's something  I would listen to.  Let me know  what they're talking about  like right now.  Okay?  They're talking about...  Yeah, yeah.  Because I'm definitely 
[03:54:00]  subscribe if you just  let me know  what they're talking about.  And then, you know,  you'll get credit for it,  I guess.  I guess that's how it works.  Okay?  Okay.  Yeah, just go over there.  You'll be all right.  Don't worry.  You won't get fired.  I promise.  Tell her you got like  a company with 10 vans  with 10 radios.  Yeah.  This is pretty important.  I do have a lot of radios  if you look up my name.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  Okay, I'll hold on.  For a second.  I'm holding on.  She's going over  to turn the radio on.  Hopefully there's  a nice long delay.  And, uh...  It'll seem like  there's some kind of magic.  Like it's a magic trick  that I'm pulling.  Some kind of magic.  Subscribe.  It's like 14...  something for...  The Iron Woman. 
[03:55:00]  Wait, oh.  Hi.  What seems to be the problem?  You can't just turn the radio...  Can I speak to your supervisor, please?  Can I speak to your supervisor, please?  Thank you.  Thank you, Missy.  Now I'm mad.  She can't turn the radio  to a girl?  No.  Hi.  Hi.  This is Wendy? 
[03:55:30]  Okay.  And you're the supervisor?  Why couldn't that nice lady  just put on  XM channel 202?  Because I was inquiring as to that.  I have a lot of radios.  I want to keep my subscriptions.  But I wasn't able to  get her to turn on 202  to tell me what  Opie and Anthony  were doing today.  It's kind of hard  to do.  Why is it hard? 
[03:56:00]  Why is it hard?  But you're selling the product  and I'm kind of...  That's the reason  I would subscribe to XM  is for the Opie and Anthony show.  She really didn't know  much about it.  About the Opie and Anthony show.  I would fire her.  You can tell me about it?  Okay.  You can listen to it  and tell me  what they're talking about?  Off the top of your head,  tell me what  Opie and Anthony  are all about.  What do they do? 
[03:56:30]  Because I heard  they're kind of,  you know...  They're comedy?  Certainly are.  What kind of comedy?  Yeah, what kind?  Is it dirty talk?  Is it potty talk?  Cut!  Is it potty talk?  Hello?  Oh, you want me to  just like step on this  if I'm interested?  Yeah.  But if I ask some questions,  there's a little bit  of a problem, I see. 
[03:57:00]  Maybe I just want  a little more information  on what the product is about.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Me.  Ma'am.  Hello, Wendy.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't do voices,  but Wendy...  But comedy show  is a little vague.  I got to know  if they're dirty mouthed.  I have kids  in the car sometimes.  Are they dirty mouthed  or potty mouthed?  I hear there's a guy there,  Jimmy Norton,  and he's an animal.  He was on...  He was on Jay Leno  the other night. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, is it extreme language?  Like, do they...  Look, look.  I don't want...  Okay, look.  I don't want to get you mad,  but I'm going to say something.  Okay, look.  Do they say, like,  fuck?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for using  that language,  but do they say that?  Do they say shit?  Try twat.  Shit?  Do they say that?  How about twat?  Because my kids...  My kids hear that in school,  so I wouldn't really  be concerned with that,  but, okay,  hold on to your hat here. 
[03:58:00]  Cunt.  Do they use that word?  Do they...  You don't want to continue  with this conversation?  Why?  No, no, I'm sorry, man.  Wait, I'm sorry.  I want to subscribe.  I really do.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I don't want to lose  my subscription.  Try poophole.  I got a lot of them.  Try poophole.  I got a lot of them.  I want to subscribe.  How do I go about subscribing?  Poophole.  Poophole.  Oh, I could get it today?  Okay.  What about poopy hole?  Do they say poopy hole? 
[03:58:30]  Because that's like  a juvenile thing  that a kid could hear.  No, don't end the call.  Don't end the call.  Don't end the call, please.  I want to subscribe.  I want to.  I do.  What do I need to do  right now?  Mouthfucking.  Do they talk about  mouthfucking?  I want to subscribe.  I do.  I got my credit card out.  I got my credit card out.  Do you need the number?  Ma'am?  Hello? 
[03:59:00]  Fuck.  She...  Mouthfucking.  Oh, is she pissed?  Mouthfucking.  Oh, is she mad?  The old mouthfuck got her, huh?  Calling me for a fucking subscription.  Believe me, I pay enough.  I've tried to get radios  turned on in the past.  I wound up just  out of frustration paying.  Actually, lately,  they've been pretty good.  It's hysterical.  Does that show, XMN,  like how ill-informed  some of the dummies  that are selling your things are?  Yeah, maybe, you know, 
[03:59:30]  they should check the...  They should have a cross-check list  of employees of the company  that perhaps you shouldn't  waste time and money.  Yeah, yeah.  So that if you go to call them,  a little red flag comes up  and goes,  yep, they work for the place.  Didn't know who Eric Logan was either.  That's promising, isn't it, Eric?  You listening, Eric?  They don't know who Eric Logan is.  I guess they gave customer service  to Sirius already.  Yeah, yeah.  Let them know the deal.  The final track  from the Pat Duffy-Matt show. 
[04:00:00]  Matt says radio sucks  and he's only interning  because of O&A.  That would be us.  The difference between me and you  is I'm not ashamed of myself.  I know.  I guess I am.  No.  I don't care.  I'm going to go home  and I'll listen to my music  and I don't care.  I'm going to go home  and I'm going to sleep.  All right.  Sorry, I'm trying to build  an empire here.  Ew.  You want to be a cop?  No, I don't want to make  a lot of money  and do a little work.  Well, cop is not the way  to go, though.  So, I am not like, 
[04:00:30]  this radio thing  is just something  that I could do.  You're just doing this?  Do it?  Yep.  I'm doing it to work  here  with O&A.  That's it.  Holy shit.  He's trying to build  an empire.  Stupid is trying  to build an empire.  Listen to the music.  That's great.  Start with a fucking  lean-to.  I'm trying to build  an empire.  Empire. 
[04:01:00]  Do you want to join  the rebellion?  I'm trying to build  an empire.  Dark shit teeth.  Pat's get-go.  Oh, fuck.  The worst.  This is a fully  functional radio station.  I will show you  its power. 
[04:01:30]  God damn.  Oh, I want to build  an empire.  Pat's building an empire.  It's fresh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now you know  why I threw it out.  Oh, God damn.  One human evacuation  in the face at a time.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  They're all over me.  They're all over me.  Stay on topic.  What are we talking about?  I forgot what  we were talking about.  I want to be a cop.  Stay on topic. 
[04:02:00]  All right.  Good.  Well, he could be  like a stormtrooper then.  And someone is suggesting  this is your new  entry music.  You got your new  walk-on music.  Congratulations, Pat Tuffy.  Something came out of this.  Slowly and empire.  Slowly.  And poopy holes  is going to make me laugh.  Poopy hole.  I know.  She held through  poopy hole.  Mouth fucking.  Mouth fucking was it.  She was okay  with fucking shit.  Right.  Because, you know,  the kids could listen to that. 
[04:02:30]  Cunt really threw it  for a loop.  Yeah.  Poopy hole got her.  And mouth fucking.  Close to the hole.  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  Ah, well,  we'll have to meet with  human resources now.  Terrific.  What?  I don't know anyone in Iowa  that works for the company.  All right.  Why don't we do  line of the day  brought to you by  BodogFantasy.net?  I was going to say  the other one. 
[04:03:00]  Fantasy football crap, right?  Well, they have a more  detailed plug.  All right.  Fantasy football crap.  Go to BodogFantasy.net.  No.  For all you fantasy football  hobbyists,  go to BodogFantasy.net  for all your football fantasy crap.  That's good enough.  Football fantasy.  No, BodogFantasy.net.  Dot.  Net.  BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line  of the day.  He was just  drawing attention to himself.  I like when they do  silly things. 
[04:03:30]  The little punk club  out there for midgets  is called Heebie-Jeebies.  Fucking Jim,  and you only played  half a game today.  I would have put that  as like,  that was a winner for me.  That was very funny.  Heebie-Jeebies.  Pat's father's on the line.  Pat's dad,  what's up?  I don't like it  $14.95 for my radio.  Oh, what?  It's a special deal.  Is it really, Anthony?  I have no idea.  What do you think? 
[04:04:00]  I look at my bills  or pay for these things?  I've been paying it  since the prime time, man.  I don't like it  $14.95 for three months.  No shit.  Come in  and brush your teeth  with shit.  Bye.  All right, bye.  We gotta fuck up again.  Then everyone gets  discounts.  Yeah.  That's what I learned.  That's what I learned, too.  You get discounts.  Suspended.  Outrage.  What then?  Apparently,  there was a shortage  of available computers today.  That was the line of the day.  So we don't have the... 
[04:04:30]  What happened?  Okay,  that was the one runner-up,  now they're telling me,  and this is the line of the day.  Okay.  How's mother?  Still no word.  All right,  here's your line of the day.  Here comes  the line of the day.  Put up game of the day  in my hand  in a few minutes.  And not to be a tattletale,  you don't snitch in prison.  That's the first thing.  Snitches get... 
[04:05:00]  They get...  Stitches.  Snitches get stitches.  Oh, my God.  I mean,  you dumb bitch.  You know what?  That's not line of the day.  I succeed  and give that to Norton.  Norton's just line of the day.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You what?  Give it to me?  I hear you.  I said I succeed  and give you line of the day.  You're wrong on both counts.  I succeed.  There's your line of the day.  What was just said by Norton.  There it is. 
[04:05:30]  I succeed.  I succeed.  Yep.  Okay,  that's not lying.  Norton's was hilarious.  Succeed?  What does that mean?  He sucks seed.  How does that...  Succeed.  I succeed.  Speaking of which,  it's time for the plugs.  Where are you going to be  sucking cock next there, Rich?  See, there's Aaron Coulter  doing that blue stuff  I was telling you.  I don't know.  Oh, next week,  I'm working with Tommy Davidson  at Caroline's.  Next weekend.  I have to announce  that my writing shows 
[04:06:00]  are sold out this weekend,  but next weekend,  I'll be in Danbury, Connecticut.  Danbury.  Danbury.  Danbury.  Bring your blueberries.  Danbury.  Danbury.  12th and 13th,  the Danbury Treehouse.  Danbury.  Danbury.  Danbury.  Working on a new hour.  And...  And cunt.  And cunt.  What did you mean by succeed?  You know,  when I...  You know,  you give up,  you give it up,  you back out, 
[04:06:30]  or what's the word?  Like when the South  tried to succeed  from the Union.  Right.  Whatever,  you know,  I'm tired, man.  I'm coming,  you dumb bitch.  What's the word?  Roll over and shut up.  It's succeed.  I told you.  I didn't know what you meant,  though.  I sucked his joint  for 30 minutes,  and his prick  was like a piece  of spaghetti.  Why are you  running away scared?  He farted in my head.  He pulled his pants down.  Jimmy pulled his pants down.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  There's like a little  bird fart, too.

Danny's putting together  the Hall of Fame  of, you know,  great lines 
[04:07:30]  from the 8-Track corn.  Thus far.  From the four segments  we've done so far.  They are good.  What's up, Danny?  No, I was just gonna say,  I wanted to have it  for today,  but I'll definitely  have it tomorrow.  Yeah, it's fine.  Definitely have it for tomorrow.  I think we gave  these guys a show today.  Secede.  Secede, right?  Secede.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we finally  gave him a show.  Maybe.  We'll have to look later  on the message boards  and listen to the replay  and really pound  ourselves over it.  Did we give him a show? 
[04:08:00]  They don't really  talk about the show  much anymore,  the message boards.  No.  I can ask my brother.  Better than asking  for football picks.  He sucks ass  at that.  All right.  I guess,  Rich, take us out.  I guess my car's outside.  I don't think I'm  going to get out of here.  Stay tuned tomorrow.  Tomorrow, 
[04:08:30]  contest starts.  No, that's just for people  that listen on regular radio.  Oh, really?  That's why we were  mentioning over here.  It has nothing to do  with this stuff.  We really need these  fuckers to start  supporting the local  radio stations.  If they listen on XM  over there,  then what happens?  Look,  we don't want you  XM people winning this.  It's pretty much  the truth.  This contest is just  to get stupid ratings  on some regular radio stations.  Yeah.  Let's be honest  with each other.  So this contest 
[04:09:00]  isn't for you.  I'm sorry you can't come.  Oh, I got to say  I started off slow  but I came alive.  You know,  it just builds.  That's what I like  about this show.  It builds.  It builds.  How it builds.  You know what I mean?  It's an empire.  It's building a little empire.  Yeah, it's building an empire.  What an idiot.  I'm trying to build an empire.  All right.  Now I got to hear  the rest of that.  Sir Puke on Face.  Yes.  Marry a Helmsley.  He's just standing  with fucking a young  Barney Miller  trying to fucking 
[04:09:30]  build a radio empire.  Matt just wanted  to straighten his hat  and get out of here.  Just wants to  rouse some skills.  All right.  We got lots to look forward  to on tomorrow's show.  Have a good day.  Yep.  Bye.  I'm done.  Later.  Later.  Later.
