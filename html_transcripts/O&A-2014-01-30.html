<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a dismissive comment on a Ron Jeremy publicity stunt, quickly transitioning to a mocking commentary on Atlanta's unpreparedness for a minor snowstorm and ice.  The hosts ridiculed the resulting traffic chaos and criticized local officials' response.  Listeners Bill (Florida), Matt (Georgia), and Jeff (Mississippi) called in, describing their experiences with the weather and the South's general lack of winter driving preparedness and snow removal resources.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a humorous, often graphic, discussion about the composition of Chicken McNuggets, fueled by listener speculation, including unsubstantiated claims about wrestling mat material being used in their production.

The conversation then shifted to a discussion of the documentary *Tim's Vermeer*, highlighting the extreme lengths the subject went to recreate a Vermeer painting.  This included building period-appropriate furniture, learning Dutch and pottery, and creating his own 17th-century paints and lenses.

Next, the show focused on the TLC show *90 Day Fiancé*, with detailed and often crude commentary on several couples' relationships, particularly focusing on perceived insecurities of the American men and the motivations of their foreign partners. A caller shared his experience marrying a much younger woman he met through "Island Girl," prompting further discussion on the topic.  A specific couple from *90 Day Fiancé* was discussed, focusing on the caller's belief that the Russian wife was scamming her American fiancé, detailing observations about their interactions, including the wife's coldness and reluctance to eat in front of the fiancé's family.  This segment also touched on the hosts’ podcast, "Super Puke with Bob Kelly," highlighting Bob Kelly's vomiting, and a comedic reminiscence about Bob Balaban in *Midnight Cowboy*.  A caller shared a humorous gym encounter involving Tony Danza and an elderly woman, leading to a discussion about annoying behaviors of older people, particularly in pharmacies, and their perceived loneliness.  A Jimmy Kimmel man-on-the-street segment about the State of the Union address was analyzed, with speculation about the authenticity of the responses. The segment concluded with a debate on whether a "gay voice" is innate or learned, with callers offering varying perspectives and anecdotes, including a gay caller challenging the hosts' generalizations.

The show continued with a heavy focus on sexuality and vocal patterns between gay and straight men, fueled by discussions about whether a "gay voice" is innate or learned, using examples like Greg Louganis and Rob Halford.  A caller recounted a seven-year-old relative exhibiting what he perceived as flamboyant homosexual behavior. The hosts also discussed a past "Hi, Mom, I'm Gay" bit and a negative interaction with a gay rights group, a Doritos commercial with a suggestive glory hole, and a recurring caller, "Tippy Tom," whose sober and intoxicated voices were compared. Tippy Tom's death from a fall down the stairs was also mentioned.  Other topics included Colin Quinn's upcoming performance, a Brooklyn school cutting its gifted program,  Janet Jackson's "Nipplegate," a TLC show featuring a teenager with facial disfigurement, and the prevalence of internet-connected cameras in homes.  Colin Quinn called into the show.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved a discussion about the underwhelming Super Bowl Boulevard event in New York City, attributed to the cold weather, including a failed tuba performance due to freezing instruments. Colin Quinn, a studio guest, offered cynical commentary.  The conversation then shifted to a rambling, often vulgar, phone call with Lady Di, who was intoxicated and admitted to drinking numerous Natty Ice beers.  The hosts engaged in a highly personal interrogation regarding her job search, bed bug infestation, and life choices, punctuated by a graphic pornographic clip.  The discussion included mentions of a Writers Guild Awards hosting gig and one host punching Boomer Esiason in elementary school.

The show later featured a conversation about the deposit return on beverage cans in New Jersey, which segued into a discussion about a caller named Jimmy who had bed bugs.  The hosts engaged in crude and sexually explicit jokes about Jimmy's bed bugs, Lady Di (a female guest present in the studio), and Lady Di's supposed attraction to Colin (one of the hosts).  The conversation also included details about the hosts’ and Lady Di’s schedules and appearances, concluding with teasing about a future appearance on the show, potentially in costume, followed by more sexually suggestive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  On top of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Goodness gracious.  Welcome.  I know the Ron Jeremy thing is on here.  I don't even want to acknowledge he did that.  It's such a lame attempt at some attention and publicity.  We're not going down that road.  Yeah.  And we like Ron Jeremy, but it's kind of douchey. 
[00:00:30]  It is.  And it's been done.  He redid Wrecking Ball, I guess.  I don't care.  Right.  I did see it a little bit, but I don't care.  I didn't even care.  It's a bit forced.  Didn't even care.  I want to talk about hot Lana.  Cold Lana.  I just don't understand.  Well, they have no clue how to function in the cold and a couple inches of snow.  Two inches of snow, certainly some ice.  Yeah.  Because they don't get winter weather, but no.  Two inches of snow just shuts down a major city. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And I understand they're not really prepared for snow down there because it doesn't happen often,  but I don't know.  I don't get it.  This car is still stranded, I guess.  Yeah.  And now people are going to be driven back to their cars so they could attempt to get them  off the highways.  Yeah.  They're just clogging up the highways.  It just goes to show you, if there was a real national emergency, we're fucked.  Oh, yeah.  Because every fucking highway will look like that if there's a real national emergency 
[00:01:30]  where people have to get somewhere or just get away from cities or things like that.  You're done.  You need a go bag and a motorcycle or you're pretty much fucking dead.  And you can't count on your elected officials.  No, they don't know what they're doing either.  Anytime you throw them a curve, like anytime it's not just complete business as usual, which  they fuck up also, but like business as usual, they will fuck it up and then they get on,  well, we've made some errors.  We did make some errors. 
[00:02:00]  We're reassessing the situation.  Next time, we're getting a committee together.  Yes, a blue ribbon panel.  A blue ribbon panel to see what we did right and what we could do better next time this  happens.  Because like everyone left at the same time and that was their problem.  All right.  Well, that happens.  We should have had, he goes, we should have like the schools leave first.  Right.  And then, you know, people at work and the government officials.  If you don't have the snow removal capabilities, yeah, that's, that's something you could 
[00:02:30]  do as an elected official.  Go, okay, fuck.  All right.  We got to, it looks like this shit has happened.  So let's, uh, let's just close the schools.  And if it turns out it's a bust, oh, well, yeah, I don't know, but I'm seeing the pictures  and it's so funny to me.  It's just bumper to bumper, all the lanes closed.  Look, there it is on CNN.  Like the whole highway shut down.  How do they have no snow removal?  Like I can see not being prepared for a storm, but how do you have, like, they don't have, 
[00:03:00]  they have two shovels in all of Georgia.  It doesn't happen.  It doesn't even happen once a year.  Yeah.  I think they've been talking how this, uh, last happened in 2010.  So that's what, I mean, three ish, three ish, four ish years ago.  When you have a budget and then you have snow removal in the budget, or you could take that  money and allocate it for something else.  Uh, for peaches.  Right.  Right.  The old peach industry.  Make sure the peaches are all right.  They are not putting it towards something that they just don't even use.  Oh, no. 
[00:03:30]  They take those gambles all the time.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  And that's what it is.  It's a gamble.  Right.  Is it going to affect the peaches?  I like a good peach every once in a while.  I hope not.  Mackinac peaches, Jerry.  The Mackinac peaches.  But fast forward.  Sometime in August when the peaches are nice and ripe in this area.  Yeah.  They'll say that, well, the prices are a bit high because of that snowstorm back in January.  Yeah.  Back in January.  Well, the peach crop affected by that deep freeze.  Right.  Yeah.  It's, I mean, we've all seen this weather so much up here. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  It just, that doesn't shut down anything anywhere else.  No, that's a dusting.  Right.  I guess it really froze the roads up, though.  A lot of ice.  It doesn't look like a lot of snow, but apparently that was all fucking ice because they have nothing  to put on the roads.  Right.  So people were just sliding around.  They couldn't even move their cars.  Let me say, we got people that are, that were affected by this shit.  Let me, let me say hi to Bill in Florida.  Bill, what's up? 
[00:04:30]  Hello, Bill.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Jesus Christ.  No, when a bit is over.  My God.  That bit ended two years ago.  My birthday was yesterday.  Oh, that's why he's upset.  I see.  I get it.  I get it.  No, apparently you don't.  What's up?  Sure I do.  Anyways, in 2010, I was driving in Atlanta during that last storm, and there was just a few inches  of snow on the ground.  And it was about two in the morning when I was driving home, and there was about 35 people 
[00:05:00]  on about a three-mile stretch of road that were just stuck and couldn't move.  And I had a police officer come up to me and tell me that they wouldn't be out for about  two days to offer any assistance.  So, where are we at now?  Because the news loves to show you footage that already happened, and they present it  in a way like, no, this is happening still.  This is how it is right now.  Yeah.  Are those roads still clogged with cars?  Because they just showed the video on TV. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  I think, just like the news always does, they're blowing some things out of proportion, but there  are some cars stranded.  What?  The news does that?  Occasionally.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  No problem, guys.  Let's go to Atlanta and say hi to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Love you.  Love your show.  Of course you do.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Anyway, it's not so much that lack of preparedness and prep for the snow and all that.  A lot of people down here just figure as long as their tires are black and round and hold 
[00:06:00]  air, that they're good to go.  And it's not like everybody up north.  I mean, I'm originally from Cleveland.  And we could drive through 30 inches of snow like it's nothing.  Everybody down here, bald tires, ice, forget it.  They're done.  They're just not ready for this type of thing.  You've got to think they're just not ready for this type of thing, because I don't think  they're that stupid down there, that they just lose their minds over two inches of snow  and ice.  Last night, I was doing some running, and there was a news crew videotaping a bridge. 
[00:06:30]  I'm actually in Columbus, Georgia right now.  They were videotaping a bridge because it still had ice on it.  After the prison inmates in a half-ton dump truck with some shovels were spreading sand  over it.  They couldn't figure out why there was still ice on a bridge.  They couldn't figure it out.  They got the prisoners out there working?  Well, they always say that bridges, you know, freeze.  They always have those warnings when you're driving.  Well, the prisoners were the only people working yesterday.  Even McDonald's was closed.  Well, that's not good. 
[00:07:00]  Damn.  How are we going to get our chicken McNuggets?  Right.  Did you see the Olympic commercial where the tie-in to the Olympics with these sponsors  is just so douchey?  Oh, is it?  Were they trying to make a moment?  They had a whole montage of Olympians, like, biting on their medals.  You know, that's the thing you do.  You win a medal and you just bite it when you're at the ceremony.  Like, oh, man.  I guess some idiot did it years ago to see if it actually was real. 
[00:07:30]  And now it's like a tradition.  A lot of people will bite their medals.  So it's a montage, you know, over-the-top music, very patriotic.  And then they go to the slow, dissolve into people biting chicken McNuggets.  It's fucking nice.  Yeah, that's something you could really equate with.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  And the point was the medals are healthier.  Yeah, exactly.  They're equating winning an Olympic medal to eating really shitty. 
[00:08:00]  With, yeah, biting into a fucking mystery meat.  Right, mystery, whatever the fuck.  Whatever that shit is.  Are they still claiming it's chicken?  I don't know what it is.  Chicken McCartilage.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Those things were...  They just grind everything right the fuck down, right?  Disgusting, yeah.  Bones, too?  Beaks.  Oh, no.  That scrotomy thing under his chin.  Oh.  Ah, it's disgusting.  I don't know.  They make a paste out of it.  Is that what that is?  Oh, it's a paste, right?  Yeah, they make like...  They grind up the chicken, make some kind of fucking paste out of it, and then squirt it 
[00:08:30]  through a machine.  Yeah, because I guess if you had, like, I don't know, sugar or salt to anything, you  can make it taste good.  It tastes pretty goddamn good.  No.  Did I say this on the air?  There's somebody close to us.  He wouldn't tell me the company.  But he told me that there's a very popular chicken company.  So, I'm a...  Well, I'm not even going to tell you what it is, because they're trying to engineer how  to make chicken taste like chicken. 
[00:09:00]  What?  That's what they're doing in the labs.  Trying to make chicken taste like chicken.  Yeah, because they found, you know, when they're shipping it and this and that, it's losing  its flavor.  So, they actually got engineers that are coming up with the chicken flavor in the labs, and  they're adding it to the actual chickens to make them taste more like chicken.  Tyler Chicken?  I'm not saying what company.  He didn't tell me what company.  I don't even want to guess, because I don't want no fucking lawsuit.  Chicken flavored beer? 
[00:09:30]  Mm-mm.  That'd be pretty good.  No, just making chicken taste like chicken.  That's where we're at.  Wow, really?  Maybe you can look it up online.  I don't even know.  Damn.  There's the paste in the Chicken McNuggets.  Ha ha ha!  Is this real?  Come on.  What's all that white stuff?  Is that the cartilage and the bones?  Yeah.  I mean, nuggets are tasty, though.  God damn.  Wow.  Yeah, because they add a lot of that artificial shit.  Or a batter, whatever it is. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is it?  This is kind of like a how is it made type of thing.  Yes.  They just grind everything up.  They put it in a little mold.  That looks like beef right there, doesn't it?  Yeah, I guess it's not cooked yet.  Oh, my God.  What's all those little white?  The white things are like, are those bits of bone and cartilage?  It's like a fucking olive loaf.  Maybe it's fat.  I don't know what it is.  Oh, fat, right, maybe.  It's probably the fat, too, sure.  Now it's going over some grate. 
[00:10:30]  No, that's going into the batter.  Yeah.  That's batter dripping.  Is that what it's doing?  They're on the grates, but the batter's going through the grates.  It goes through a curtain of whatever that is.  Yeah.  It looks like batter.  Yeah.  Whatever the hell that's made of.  I'd love to go through a curtain of batter.  Oh, wouldn't you?  Wouldn't it be fun?  Yay.  Yeah.  All right.  Now it's still on their little conveyor belt.  Right.  Chicken nuggets.  They look white.  They look like delicious chocolate-covered pretzels or something.  Oh.  Would you take a bite into one now?  No, I would not. 
[00:11:00]  Look at that.  Don't raw.  But if it was cooked, I would.  I couldn't tell you the last time I ate at McDonald's or Burger King.  Yeah.  Couldn't tell you.  Yeah.  It's been many, many years.  I went on a date there recently.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  She was on a rag, so I'm like, well, get your hopes up for a meal.  Oh, that was like an egg-type thing, milk thing to sort of-  Like a batter, no?  The breadcrumbs sticks.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  It tumbles off the conveyor onto breadcrumbs, and then more breadcrumbs, breadcrumb it.  Yeah.  On from the top.  Yeah.  It's a whole thing's a breadcrumb fucking bevy. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  It's snowing breadcrumbs.  Yes.  It's covered in that, and now it comes back out, and now they're covered and ready to  be, what, deep-fried?  Yeah.  Is that what they do?  I don't think they're healthy.  I don't think so either.  They taste fucking good, though, man.  A little sauce and a McNugget.  Holy mackerel.  What's your favorite sauce, Jimmy?  Probably mustard.  A little barbecue once in a while, but if you want the truth, I like a spicier mustard  sauce.  That's me.  There you go.  I don't know.  How it's made.  That's pretty disgusting. 
[00:12:00]  That was not a McDonald's thing.  That was just how you make a McNugget.  No, that was a chicken nugget.  Well, yeah.  They don't want to get sued.  Because there are some good chicken strips and stuff that are really chicken.  It hasn't been ground up.  Right.  That's pretty good stuff.  Oh, I heard this before.  James in Kansas City.  Go ahead.  James.  Hey, man.  Okay.  My boss told me yesterday about chicken nuggets.  She said, you know what this wrestling match when you were in high school, you wrestle  with?  Yeah.  It's the chemical in this match that they put in the chicken nuggets. 
[00:12:30]  It's on the...  All right, dude.  What's up with your voice?  Someone's got to ask.  I got to ask her something, too.  Do the McNuggets, do they cook them first or no?  Oh, no.  You got a cold?  Yeah, I got a cold, guys.  I cooked a long time ago.  I got a cold, Carson.  I think that's some kind of impediment.  I kind of feel like shit to myself.  I got the flu shot and I'm hanging in there, but I got a sore throaty thing today.  Yeah.  I thought it was going to kill me lately. 
[00:13:00]  I wonder if you...  Can you get a second flu shot?  I don't think that does anything.  That don't work?  No.  Yeah.  I think once that's in there...  Might just be a cold.  I'm a big fan of the flu shot, though.  You remember the days I would be out two, three weeks every fucking winter?  Oh, yeah.  Now I just get these shitty little just bothersome things during the winter.  A little sore throat the last couple days.  Bothersome.  Just with that gulpy shit all night long.  Gulpy shit.  Feels like you got something right there in the back of your throat. 
[00:13:30]  Can't gulp.  And just watching the alarm clock turning over.  Oh, it's now 2.48.  That's great.  Okay, I'll sleep.  15 minutes later, because I'm gulping that gulpy shit, I wake up again.  Oh, now it's 3.07.  You gotta down some NyQuil or something.  I know, I should have.  That's the shit.  Yeah, but then if you do that too late, then...  Well, you can't do it late.  We get up too early.  No, you can't do that.  You gotta time that shit out perfect.  Although Robitussin works pretty good for not making you drowsy, but clearing up the  stuffy nose and the throat and shit.  I do like that Robitussin. 
[00:14:00]  A good Tylenol PM every once in a while works.  Citizen.  You do the Tylenol PM?  Oh, boy, no.  That's nice.  Those will fucking put you out, too.  Sometimes just one.  Yeah.  Just one.  Just put you over the edge a little bit.  I will fucking fall asleep.  Anyway.  Go ahead, sir.  Go ahead, James.  Now that we have acknowledged that you have a cold...  Yes, go ahead.  Continue.  Thanks, guys.  Sure.  Well, I am the cold.  I'm well...  I hope you feel better.  Well, it's...  I thought it was...  Oh, shit. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you cheese whizzing this cold?  Go ahead, sir.  Just relax.  I understand how you feel.  Just talk about it.  It's okay.  Worst call of the day right here.  Are you trying to...  Can I do this for you?  Can I do this?  Chicken McNuggets are made with the same stuff wrestling mats are.  I've heard this.  What?  I have heard this.  They add this in for substance.  What?  Like filler?  As a filler.  I've heard this.  I'm not saying it's true.  I don't think that would be true.  Because we're saying Chicken McNuggets. 
[00:15:00]  I don't feel like having a lawsuit with a massive fucking corporation.  I don't think that's true.  But I have heard this.  Can we look this up, Sam Roberts?  I don't think they'd...  Here's why they won't come after you.  Because they would have to then say exactly what they do do to make it.  Right.  And I don't think that they would want to...  But I heard the wrestling mat thing.  It's not like it's actual wrestling mats that they're grinding down.  But the same shit they put in wrestling mats, they supposedly, you know, use that in Chicken McNuggets.  I bet that's in Snopes.  Go to Snopes.  Go to Snopes.com. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Yoga mats.  And now this one says McRib contains ingredient most commonly found in yoga mats.  So it's like, does it just change all the time?  Well, yoga mats are...  The quarter pounder with cheese has stuff that's on a ping pong table.  Why should it be that yoga mats is just delicious?  Hey, I always tell you what they put in the hamburgers, too.  I heard from my grandma, they put worms in their hamburgers.  Yeah, but...  They put worms in their hamburgers?  They put worms? 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  I mean, let's...  They'll put that in hamburgers.  Yeah.  Are you bullied?  I bet you're bullied.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I, uh...  What's...  I was at work...  This guy I was working with, he found old, moldy ice in his beverage at Burger King.  Well, Burger King...  Burger King.  Burger King.  Burger King.  I'm sorry.  I have...  Wow, you're all about this shit, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Just talking about every health violation.  Yeah.  It's not a rat tail whatsoever.  Frumble.  Yes.  Frumble.  All right, James.  We gotta go.  You're terrific, though.  I gotta tell you.  You guys are the best radio show on.  No shit we are.  Oh, I know.  It's crazy how great we are.  But at this point, there's no other radio show.  It really is.  That used to mean something when we actually had competition.  Now.  I used to call you guys about Stern, but, you know, you guys blow his ass out of war.  All right.  Oh, boy.  I can't find the hang-up here.  Jesus. 
[00:17:00]  Shit about it.  Thank you, James.  Go grab a tissue and some fucking cold medicine.  Yes.  Nasal fuck.  Sounds good.  Sounds really good.  No, he doesn't.  I couldn't even name another radio show at this point that I feel like we even compete with.  Nice.  Fucking...  There are so few in the morning that are really funny on the road.  Like, you'll find them in sometimes not the top ten markets, because they're the ones  that don't have the fucking lawyers breathing down their necks.  Right.  Yeah.  There's some fun ones, but not many.  The ones that go under the radar.  Just, yeah.  They're just not where the lawyers are.  I remember the day one of our dopey fucking bosses told us that we were finally on the 
[00:17:30]  radar, and that's not a good thing.  Remember that?  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  People are going to start paying more attention to you guys now.  Yeah, great.  And you'll see.  And he was right.  I'm like, that's good, right?  No.  He was absolutely right.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Mississippi.  Jeff.  Hey.  Hey.  Jeffy.  Man.  Talking about all that chicken stuff.  Chicken and vodka.  There's my meal.  Chicken flavored vodka. 
[00:18:00]  But anyway, we were talking about the snow earlier.  Chicken flavored vodka.  Jesus Christ.  We were talking about the snow earlier.  In Mississippi, we have five snow plows for the whole state.  Oh.  It's more than schools.  When it's snow, you've got to figure out where to send them.  And they keep them up in North Mississippi, and they can't get down here because of the  snow.  Well, of course you're going to keep them.  If you only have five snow plows, I would assume you would keep them in Northern Mississippi.  That's right. 
[00:18:30]  That's right.  Right.  The state owns about five snow plows and have little spreaders on the back.  But that has worked out in your favor for many, many years that they don't have a budget  for snow removal.  You do understand that.  That's very true.  And every once in a while, you're going to get caught.  They don't need to put it in the budget because it's like insurance.  They could gamble on it.  And Atlanta is in hell.  And you watch.  They're not going to change everything for next year.  They're going to take the same gamble next year.  Yeah.  But they're talking about some lady having her baby on this.  Oh.  That happens on a Tuesday. 
[00:19:00]  It doesn't.  You know.  If you're going to have a baby, you're going to have a baby.  I don't like those stories.  They bother me.  Yeah.  Enough, right?  Yeah.  They just bother me.  Oh, a lady had a baby on a subway today.  Yeah.  All right.  Are those whites-only snow plows down there in Mississippi?  Yeah.  The colored ones are very different.  They have no snow-pushing ability.  They're just trucks.  Well, I'm not giving up on this.  No?  This guy's going to help us out with the chicken thing.  Mike.  No, I don't want you, Mike. 
[00:19:30]  Ryan in New York.  Ryan.  How you doing, boy?  Sorry to Mike, but it was a boring call.  And so far, we've had nothing but boring calls.  So I'm trying to pump it up here.  Ryan, what do you got?  What up, yo?  I read something on the internet over the summer about these chicken nuggets.  Hey, I know.  It's got to be true.  Somebody actually tried to expose what it was.  And what they do is they ground up all the byproducts.  So they take whatever is the leftovers, whatever nobody wants, grind it all up, and they throw 
[00:20:00]  it into a big fat.  But bacteria starts to form, so they throw bleach and a few other products in there.  Well, I doubt, let me say this, I don't think any food place, I mean, there's weird shit  that goes into food.  I don't think anyone just takes bleach and dumps it in there.  Ronald McDonald is just dumping Clorox into the bag.  Yeah, exactly.  On camera.  Yeah.  They have to kill all the...  What's wrong with just using the good part of a chicken?  It's cost.  Are they just trying to cut corners? 
[00:20:30]  Do you know what it is?  We would be really shitty if we went into the chicken McNugget business.  So we would do it properly and wonder why our profits suck.  Can you imagine that you use a chicken and you look in the garbage and it's like, there's  a lot of chicken left.  Yeah, yeah.  That head and feet.  I hate to see all that thrown out.  Let's do something.  Use that.  Your first shot is you take a hammer and you mash them and nobody eats them.  That's how chicken wings were discovered, by the way.  Back in the day, if you live in Buffalo, you get the true story.  Yeah.  There were a bunch of kids and they were out drinking and they went to a restaurant, 
[00:21:00]  their mom's restaurant or whatever, and they're like, Mom, we're hungry.  And she's like, man, we sold everything.  We have nothing left until the delivery trucks come tomorrow.  So then she goes, let me think about this.  And it was all the shitty parts of the chicken, the chicken wings and the chicken legs that they  never used back in the day.  She goes, maybe I could whip something up.  So she whips up something with the hot sauce and everything.  And that's how chicken wings were invented.  Before that, they wouldn't use those parts of the chicken.  You know, they're trying to eat something that was bad, that had gone bad. 
[00:21:30]  And they're just trying to cover it with this really weird buffalo fucking sauce will kill  anything.  Well, they knew it was a shitty part of the chicken, so they really fucking spiced it up.  And that's how it started.  I'm going to have wings for the Super Bowl.  Are you?  Yes, I'm looking forward to that.  Hell no.  Have some nice blue cheese and cut nice fucking farts all the way home.  I'm mad at Roland today.  Because, you know, I'm all in with his weird diet.  His fucking non-diet.  So when all that Super Bowl food came, I knew I wasn't going to eat the chicken wings. 
[00:22:00]  Because chicken wings are one of the worst things you could eat.  They're unbelievable how bad they are for you.  And all the other stuff.  And then I look at that brisket.  And then stupid Roland, he goes, oh, that's on my, I could eat that.  I could eat the brisket.  So I'm thinking, oh, if it's on Roland's weird diet, I could eat it today as well.  And then he fucking tells me he was making believe in that there's brown sugar and all this other shit on it.  Yeah.  That thing tasted amazing.  At first, it was phenomenal.  It was ridiculous.  Of course it was bad for you if it tasted that good.  Of course it was.  So goddamn good.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  It was tasty.  It was very good.  All that food was good.  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Certainly was.  Hi, Roro.  What's up, Roro?  That was good stuff, man.  Yeah, it's delicious.  What are you doing?  What?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  It's delicious.  You're just sitting down to say hi to him?  Yeah, let's sit down.  You relax.  Pull up a chair.  I said to come back here, so I'm going to go back there.  No, you take a look.  You relax.  This is awkward.  Did you see Tim Vermeer?  No.  The Pendulum movie?  I saw it last night. 
[00:23:00]  How was it?  You realize there's just fucking people out there that are way more intelligent than you.  Oh.  I saw that.  You just realize that people, there are people that their brains are wired in such a way  that you can't even fucking fathom.  Just Penn's friend decides he needs to paint a Vermeer.  The problem is he's never painted in his life, but he studies this artist.  And there's been art critics thinking that Vermeer didn't paint traditionally, that he might  have used some trickery, something.  Some tomfoolery?  So he decided that he did, and he used lenses and all sorts of shit and mirrors, and he 
[00:23:30]  was actually kind of like just painting the image that he could see through the images  and the mirrors and stuff.  So he decides, I'm going to do this.  And he spends well over, I think Penn told me off air, it was like five years.  Yeah, I think he said that on the air.  The film took five years.  Because the guy decided, all right, I now have to build the, I call it a set, and in  the movie it looks like a set.  But he basically, in his warehouse in San Antonio, he builds the set of the painting. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  But the problem is, it's all shit from the 1600s, 1700s, whenever the fuck Vermeer was  around.  So he can't find any of this in antique stores.  So he decides, well, now I've got to learn woodworking.  I've never done woodworking before.  And he builds all the furniture that's in this painting.  So he has to become a furniture builder.  And, you know, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  And he has to figure out the dimensions by looking at the painting like, oh, okay, this  chair is about 28 inches off the ground, and this is the dimensions of this.  And then he makes all the fucking furniture.  And then he makes the vase or a vase in the painting.  He's never done kiln work before.  So he has to do pottery.  So now he makes pottery.  And then he's figuring out, like, the windows that were used.  They don't fucking use those anymore, and the intricate work in the windows.  So he builds those.  And he builds this whole fucking thing in a warehouse.  But then he has to go over to, he has to learn Dutch, because he has to do research on 
[00:25:00]  the fucking Vermeer guy.  So he learns a language just so he can talk to these people that know more about Vermeer.  Then he decides, well, I can't use the paints that are available today.  I want to use the paints that Vermeer would have had available back in the day.  So then he learns how to fucking mix his own paints from the 1600s, 1700s, how they did  it back then.  And then he's grinding down lenses, because he needs the exact lens that he thinks Vermeer  possibly used.  It's not proven that Vermeer actually did it this way. 
[00:25:30]  There's no proof of this, but it's assumed.  So now he's grinding down these fucking lenses how they did it back in the 1600s or 1700s.  And then he invites Martin Mull, who supposedly is a great painter.  Martin Mull.  Martin Mull is a great painter.  Supposedly.  Because he shows the technique he thinks he discovered or rediscovered, something that  maybe was used back in the day, and shows Martin Mull.  And he takes a picture of his dad, and he goes, I've never painted before, but I'm going 
[00:26:00]  to show you what you can do with this technique.  And he paints a beautiful portrait off the photograph of his dad, but he's never painted  before.  What the fuck?  I guess he's just good at everything.  Well, he's an inventor and stuff, and he's a graphic design artist, so he definitely has  skills, but he also knows how to wire his brain to figure shit out.  Penn said that his friend, he goes, I think this is about his daughter going to college.  This is a brilliant guy who needed to distract himself with something. 
[00:26:30]  Instead of curing cancer for all of us, he decided to do something crazy like this.  Oh, he studied the clothes, because there's two people in the painting.  Yeah.  I think it's called The Music Lesson, if you want to look it up.  So he studies the clothing, but they don't make those clothes anymore, so he made those  clothes from scratch, getting the right people that know how to fucking sew and shit.  Then there's a rug in there that you can't fucking buy anymore.  Did he get a loom?  Yes!  He made the rug!  No way he made the rug.  He made the rug!  And then he's got the two people. 
[00:27:00]  One is his daughter that came back from college for a summer, I think.  Puts her in all the clothes that were used in the original painting.  Is she hot?  She's all right.  And then he has all these apparatuses to make sure she can't move at all, that she can't,  you know, these fucking, like, vices and stuff.  Gee.  All in.  He cuts, like, the side of his warehouse out, because he has to put those fucking windows  in, like in the original painting.  And then proceeds to painstakingly paint for, I think it was close to 200 days. 
[00:27:30]  He said he had to do every individual knot of that rug by hand.  Come on.  And he's never painted before.  What are you even talking about?  I'm looking at a picture that he did in another picture, Johannes Vermeer, I guess his name  was.  Yeah.  And the girl with a pearl earring.  Right.  Look, can you look that up?  Girl with a pearl necklace.  I thought this was a photo, too.  This looks like a fucking photograph.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Even more than this.  I guess that's the one this guy likes.  Right.  Have you seen this before?  I've never heard of this guy.  I'm just a non...  I've never heard of Vermeer.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I did.  Go to the second one in Sam.  Have you ever heard of Vermeer?  Nope.  I have not heard of...  That looks like Scarlett Johansson.  That is Scarlett Johansson.  Oh, it's from a movie?  Oh, no wonder.  Wait, no.  It's a movie poster.  That is a movie poster?  That's a movie poster?  Oh, that's...  That's a different photo.  Maybe she played some Vermeer character.  I don't fucking know.  That one's the painting.  Oh, there's the painting. 
[00:28:30]  That does look like Scarlett Johansson.  Oh, but...  Oh, good.  Yeah, well, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, so...  This is Tim's Vermeer.  I don't think the movie's for everyone, but it's fascinating that there are people that are  that smart.  I want to see it.  I really...  I almost went to the premiere the other night, but I just couldn't.  But I really want to fucking see it.  I enjoyed it.  It wasn't slow at all.  It wasn't slow at all.  Go watch that.  It moved quite nicely.  But he had to build all that shit.  Yeah.  That's the crazy part.  And then there's an instrument in there.  I forgot. 
[00:29:00]  It's sort of like a piano, I guess, but it's not a piano.  I forgot the name of it.  Guitar?  Bass Accord?  Oh.  No, not even that.  I know the...  Hurti Gurti?  A tuba?  I know the basic ones.  Flute?  Drums?  And he built...  Carnet?  He built that instrument so he could paint it.  Harmonica?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Some of them other instruments we got.  That are sort of like a piano, though.  Oboe?  Wouldn't be an oboe?  Volley?  Yeah, that played pretty good.  But just the amount of time... 
[00:29:30]  I mean, he's an entrepreneur.  He doesn't have to work, obviously.  So, first of all, you've got to blow off your job for a while.  So you can even attempt something like this.  Yeah, you can't have any kind of responsibilities.  And then he discovers stuff in the original painting that has never been discovered before.  Really?  While going through this process.  Is it Waldo somewhere?  There's a log on the floor.  A dog log.  He makes his daughter shit on the floor.  So we make it authentic?  No, this is a schnauzer. 
[00:30:00]  So he has to raise one from a pup and wait until it's exactly eight weeks old.  So he can get the right log size.  Feed it right.  So it's the consistency.  The same shit consistency.  Exactly.  They eat the toenails of Negroes in those days.  Jesus.  But...  Well...  Fascinating.  Absolutely fascinating.  Just to know that the guy had to, like, just recreate everything.  Yeah.  Crazy.  Just insane.  Insanity.  I wasn't, uh, watching something so, uh... 
[00:30:30]  Intellectual.  Artsy-fartsy.  Artsy.  Artsy.  And I watched, uh...  Which I am now just fucking...  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  And I hate reality shows, but I can't help it.  Fucking 90 Day Fiance.  Oh, you are.  Is hilarious.  Best show on TV.  These fucking guys are such loser saps.  And that one guy that's with that fucking Spanish chick...  Yep. 
[00:31:00]  ...is gay.  We kind of...  I told you.  So gay.  We played a few clips the other day.  That's the Colombian broad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That has a ridiculous body?  Slammin' body, and...  Did you watch the newest episode?  Where she gets in the hot tub?  Uh, yes.  Holy shit.  And, yeah.  Is there a clip of it?  She's in a bikini.  I don't know.  That fucking show...  You could just sum it up.  The guys are these needy, jealous, clingy dudes. 
[00:31:30]  They seem like mama's boys.  Mama's boys.  And they're with these chicks that, for the most part, they're not even in the same category  as these guys.  They've got them because they're American, and these girls are from other countries and  want to be Americans.  Basically Russian brides.  Yeah.  But they're from other places and stuff.  Right.  But the same concept.  And they will ditch these fucking guys in no time.  That Brazilian model girl...  Yeah.  ...is stunning.  Yeah.  She fucking...  She went to get her hair done, and she's like, I'm done getting my hair to do the... 
[00:32:00]  And the girl's like, you could be a model.  Right.  And she gives her a number, and the guy's like, I'm a little nervous about her model.  Like any...  They just know.  Putting her in any situation where a guy might actually talk to her...  Oh, man.  ...is petrifying to these saps.  Someone's going to pull up with a Ferrari and just yank her out of that house.  This guy...  Never to be seen again.  And that guy's going to be on the floor crying in the fetal position. 
[00:32:30]  The guy's a little overweight.  He's got like male pattern balding going on.  And he's with this girl that is absolutely has the potential of being a model.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  And he knows it.  That's the thing.  He fucking knows that he's done.  He's just sitting there like realizing that he's so close to her finding out that she's hot.  Right.  Yes.  And once she finds out that she's hot, she's going to be like, why am I hanging out with  this overweight Mormon weirdo?  Yes.  Weirdo.  When she's fucking talking and she's like, she says I was beautiful. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  I don't...  She said I can be model.  I can be model.  And they put the fake eyelashes on her and do her whole makeup.  And they turn it to the mirror camera thing.  And I just went like, holy fuck.  This is the hottest girl I've ever seen.  What about the one from Cleveland with the Russian broad?  Oh, that fucking thing.  Another sap.  She is so not into this dude.  Not even slightly.  Not a bit. 
[00:33:30]  Not even as a person.  And he has to do the uncomfortable chuckle whenever she just shows that she hates this  guy in front of his family and everything.  And she's just like, oh, she does that.  You know, she...  And she's torn because she doesn't want to go back to her shitty country.  She doesn't want to go back, but she doesn't want this guy.  She's also going to have the realization like, wait a minute.  I don't have to stay with this guy after I'm married.  If the fucking she says I do at this wedding that's supposed to take place in 90 days,  she's gone.  She is going to fucking ditch this guy. 
[00:34:00]  Then why would she get married if she wants to ditch him?  To live in the United States.  Yeah, the Russian brides or whatever, yeah.  They're little green cards, whatever they fucking...  They're not even green cards.  They're visas run out in 90 days.  I hope this show has a, now this is what's happening at the end.  Right, that's what I want.  I want that.  I hope they filmed this so far long ago that they could give you a solid update what's going  on with these people.  That fucking model chick is going to be like fucking Tom Brady. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  And that poor sap is going to be, yeah, I can't even watch football anymore.  Which one is the...  She's cute, man.  She's the Russian.  That's the Russian chick who is cute, yeah.  I think this plays to every guy's insecurities because I think we all, at one time or another,  dated someone out of our league and you always felt like...  You were on the brink of just losing it.  You were just holding on with your fingernails.  Just trying to keep it going and make it work.  And you just always knew that right around the corner there was someone that was probably 
[00:35:00]  better than you and she was the type of person that would go for it in a second.  You're trying to fucking hold a handful of mercury on a roller coaster.  Yeah.  Where I think you just know.  You just know.  Where you don't want to go out with him too much.  You don't want to bring him in public too much.  You're always coming up with excuses why you don't want to go out.  Yeah, we'll go to that party.  Who's going to be there?  Right.  And then you go through the whole thing.  That guy, yeah, he's too smooth.  Fuck that. 
[00:35:30]  And as soon as you dropped her back off at her house, you knew she was on the clock to  find somebody else.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't miss those fucking days.  You drop her off two seconds later.  You go, hi, honey.  Everything good?  What?  What did you enter your phone?  What are you doing?  What?  You just dropped me off five minutes ago, you whack job.  That's every fucking one of these couples.  That's why I think the show works.  Oh, it's great.  Except for the gay guy who, his family is like Carrie's mother religious. 
[00:36:00]  Really?  And you obviously know that they don't like the gay.  Right.  So he's doing everything he can to show his parents that he's not gay.  Do you think that's what it is?  He's just friends.  I think that's absolutely what it is.  And he's got the hottest one of all of them, right?  No, that model chick is really fucking attractive.  It depends on your taste.  That's the one with the possible gay guy.  No, no, no.  The model chick is the Brazilian girl.  The Brazilian girl.  Wait, does a Brazilian and a Colombian?  Yes.  The Colombian is the fucking busty Spanish girl.  Show me this again.  The Colombian girl is the one that looks like a sex doll. 
[00:36:30]  And the Brazilian girl looks like a model.  Looks like a cute model.  So they're two different types of hot.  We didn't do the Brazilian girl, did we?  No, we did.  I don't remember.  She didn't look like a model.  No, she didn't.  She was the one who couldn't believe that there was hot water in the house.  Oh, that was her.  Remember that clip?  Yeah, but she didn't look that hot there.  Dude, they gussied her up.  She looked good, but...  She had a look like a complete...  Who is she right there with the fucking black...  The black hair and the black shirt.  She is fucking...  That's the Colombian. 
[00:37:00]  That's the Colombian.  With the gay dude.  And the gay guy kissing her.  I'm just going to call him the gay guy.  They haven't confirmed or shown he was gay or anything.  They hint at it.  Oh, yeah.  But this guy, when he kisses her, there's like lifeless eyes.  Black guy's like a doll's eyes.  There's no passion in his fucking face when he kisses this 10.  When is this show on?  I'm all in.  All the time.  It's Sunday.  I was watching.  I'm like, all right, Sunday, DVR, set this fucking thing. 
[00:37:30]  What channel?  TLC.  TLC.  I'm all in.  And there's a great juxtaposition going on because the Russian chick and the ball guy  from Cleveland, he was sitting there and he kept bringing up sex.  Yes.  And she kept bringing up reasons to not have anything to do with them.  He'd even say things like, I can't wait till we have kids.  And she goes, yeah, I don't think now's a good time for that.  Oh, my God.  And then the juxtaposition is the Colombian girl, all she wants to do is have sex all  the time, so the mysterious guy that she's with is always trying to avoid having sex 
[00:38:00]  with her.  And he was living with his very religious parents, so they couldn't even sleep in the  same bed and the same room.  And I think he liked that because it was a good excuse.  But they finally moved out and got an apartment where there's like a jacuzzi and stuff.  So they show them in the jacuzzi.  He gets in wearing a cowboy hat.  Right.  And they have some wine and she gets in.  She comes walking in with the fucking bikini on.  Holy shit.  And it's like, this is the greatest show on television. 
[00:38:30]  I got it.  And then she gets in the jacuzzi and goes to kiss him.  And he's just like, like you'd kiss your fucking grandma.  Oh, my God.  And he doesn't care.  And the producers of this show are so great because, number one, they give her like the  tiniest bikini you've ever seen.  Big fucking tits.  And when she was staying with his parents, she came down the stairs at one point.  And what amounts to lingerie?  Yeah, wearing this like nighty with tiny shorts and like, but hoes too, like panty hoes. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  She comes down for breakfast.  Like just the sexiest outfit you ever saw.  Oh, my God.  And they show the, the parents are like, huh?  What a slut.  They're thinking slut.  They're thinking slut whore.  Or maybe they're happy their son's fucking finding with a woman who's.  They were not happy.  Oh, they weren't happy.  They told her to put a robe on.  They want him to find a, probably a traditional.  A traditional girl.  Very religious.  Like that.  Conservative girl.  They should realize it's either this or fucking Mike from next door.  Right.  So they're, yeah, yeah.  So they're accepting a little bit more than they would probably.  So they should accept.  And then there's the Asian girl. 
[00:39:30]  Who.  From the Philippines.  She's from the Philippines.  And she should just, she shouldn't complain about anything.  No.  She should be lucky she's even on this fucking show.  Really.  Not a looker at all.  And you could tell that they had no confidence.  Yeah.  Because I know you haven't been watching since the beginning.  No, I haven't.  They didn't start her storyline until like three episodes into the season.  Okay.  Because they're like.  She's not one of the main players.  She's not a main player.  And her part in every episode is a little smaller than the rest.  A little smaller.  Yeah.  And that relationship will probably work out.  That'll probably be the one that works out. 
[00:40:00]  I ever tell you that one of the things that creeps me out as I walk around is like the  older guys with like Asian.  Asian.  Asian chicks.  Asian chicks.  Like either their girlfriends or wives.  And the Asian chicks barely could speak English.  That has always freaked me out.  Oh, you mean like mail order kind.  It's always freaked me out.  The guys that go and get like an Asian broad.  That's a whole mindset there.  It creeps me out, man.  All the time.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's a drastic age difference.  But there's also a language problem because she doesn't really speak the English. 
[00:40:30]  Maybe it's a fetish.  The English.  I'm sure it is.  Well, it's so obviously a setup, too.  It's so obvious there's nothing real there.  It's comfortable.  Like, yeah.  Like the guy is like just taking care of his fetish.  Is this the chick?  Who is that?  You have to pay for it.  Oh, fuck that one.  Pay for what?  A clip?  What are you talking about?  How much is it?  That fucking girl, though, when she was in that beauty shop and they're gussying her up.  Yeah.  It was like, oh, no.  All I was thinking was, oh, no, this poor fucking guy doesn't know what he's in for. 
[00:41:00]  He's like, she says I could be model.  And then and he's like, oh, he kind of looks a little thing.  And then she goes, she gave me number to call.  Oh, and he's like, ha, no.  And he's like, they do the little interview with me.  He's like, you know, there's a lot of people in that industry.  I don't want them sucking her into the whole thing.  Oh, does he just not want her talking to anyone? 
[00:41:30]  What's his job?  Oh, it's some shitty thing, right?  Like she's going to be a model.  She's going to be a model.  And they showed like coming attractions of her in a photography studio.  And she's got like little props and they're taking her pictures and she looks stunning.  And she's taken to it like a fish to water.  Yes.  He was just taking photos of her in their apartment.  Right.  And she just started mugging for the camera and smiling.  She's moving around.  She's smiling, she's smiling, throwing her hair.  It's like, oh boy, this guy's fucking going to be one lonely motherfucker. 
[00:42:00]  He's going to be a heartbroken motherfucker.  Do you think she would upgrade him for somebody else?  Oh, in a second.  Oh, wow.  She just doesn't know it's out there yet.  Yeah.  She just has no idea.  But when she figures it out, forget it.  She doesn't know she's hot as fuck.  Right.  And she doesn't know that any guy that is a thousand times better than this guy in terms  of what girls deem better are out there just waiting for her.  How do these people meet?  On the internet.  On the internet.  Like some kind of a, hey, come to the United States. 
[00:42:30]  Except now that they're all on TV too, all three, the Philippines girl will be fine.  But all three of the other girls, they're all going to end up with professional athletes.  Oh, all of them.  Absolutely.  Probably black too.  I would think so.  Amazing.  Yeah, it's great.  It's great.  I was all in.  I liked the clips the other day, but now you've completely sold me.  It's fantastic.  I wish it was on demand on TLC because I want to catch up on the colder episodes.  We watch the clips.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  We got to talk to Randy in Kansas.  Oh, yeah.  I was just talking to him directly.  Awkward.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Randy.  Oh.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi.  Awkward.  What's up?  I just like to say that when I was 43 and my wife of 19 years ran off, I did what any  guy would do.  I went out and I got me a new one.  A little bit, I know it would be so great.  A Filipino gal is the greatest.  She was 23.  I was 43.  I'm now 59.  She's going to be 39. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe I do creep people out, but I couldn't be happier.  And if these divorced dicks here in the United States would ever catch on, they'd have a great  life.  They're domesticated.  See, this is what I'm saying.  They shit on the papers.  It's great.  How'd you meet her?  They're toilet trained.  I met her through a publication called Island Girl.  See?  Island Girl, a publication.  Who am I to say?  But I'm just saying this is one of those things that creeps me out. 
[00:44:00]  Did she speak a lot of English when you met her?  You know, my wife could speak English, but she wouldn't talk to me for four days because  she thought, because she thought she was embarrassed about her grade of English that she spoke.  Oh, look at that.  And now she won't shut up.  You know that?  Every time you touched her, she wanted to scream, stop touching me.  Yeah.  For me, the best move I've ever made in my entire life.  Oh, wow.  For the other six guys that I knew, they all went down in flames. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, what?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  So you know six other guys that did exactly what you did, and those didn't work out?  Yeah.  This is why this show is going to work.  Yeah.  Because I would imagine the odds are these things don't work out on the end.  You might be the exception.  I am the exception, and I can tell you that people go over there with the intention of impressing these girls,  thinking that I got money, I got houses, I got cars. 
[00:45:00]  No, no, no, that's not what they want.  They want respect, because most of the girls over there, at the time I was over there,  were 80% virginry, and mostly Catholic, but 80% virgin.  I know, turns you off, right?  So I fucking popped her cherry.  Hold on.  My fist.  We went through this way too quickly.  So you went on a website called Island Girl, or a publication, whatever you said.  A publication.  A publication, okay.  Okay.  So then you, is it a catalog of girls that possibly are available? 
[00:45:30]  A catalog of girls that are available, and...  Okay, okay.  And then, then what?  Then you go to the Philippines to meet them?  Yeah, I flew over to Cebu City, and of course I had like 10 or 12 of them lined up.  But, you know, rope went out of the herd, man.  So, all right, there's 12 lined up.  Then what happens?  Well, I took them all to dinner at different intervals and different days, and I stayed over 
[00:46:00]  there for 15 days, and was respectful for them and their families, because some of those  girls traveled four and five hours to come meet me in Cebu City.  All right, and did you have sex with any of the girls during the...  No.  Okay.  No.  All right, all right.  I'm just asking.  And then, so then you decide at the end of it, this one you really like, and then you  just take her to America?  No, I have to come back, and I spent the next six months on weekends filling out paperwork 
[00:46:30]  with a typewriter, and submitting it, and going to the government jungle bureaucracy, and it  took another...  I brought her over here on a K-9 visa, and I know K-9.  Oh, no, she's working for the police.  A K-9 visa.  Well, let me ask you a question, dude.  How do you know she's not looking for somebody else this whole time?  Hmm.  Or using you just to get to America, and then she's going to ditch you?  Well, you know, Jim, I didn't have nothing to lose after 20 years of being married, and  then wiped out.  What have I got nothing to lose?  Wow, he really was turned off to American chicks. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, you were just like, fuck it, I'm going to take a chance.  Fuck that.  I'm going to take a chance.  I had nothing to lose, and besides that, I looked at her family history.  Her father was murdered when she was six, and her mom...  Well, it's serious.  Do you understand what I said earlier?  That this is exactly what creeps me out.  This creeps me out when I see you guys.  Dad was murdered.  But it's worked for you, so...  Yeah, plus arranged marriages have happened forever, too, so I mean, there are cases where  you can meet somebody in weird circumstances and, I guess, make it work. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Wow.  Like my wife said, she goes, I didn't know who my brother or sister were.  I love them.  You know, you learn to love people through their behavior.  Okay.  You're right, though.  That's creepy.  All right.  Thank you.  That's not as creepy as I thought it would have been.  Thank you.  No, it's worked.  But he proved my point.  The other six he knows that they did not work out.  Right.  What happened in some of those situations?  They just ditched the guy to find something better in America?  Well, one fellow disclosed that he was extremely rich, and he asked me, he says, what can I 
[00:48:00]  do?  I don't know how to tell her.  So he told her.  And the girl went nuts and just, you know, started spending money.  And he was an oddball anyway, but he had a lot of money.  And she couldn't, she just, you know, from going from zero to 300 mile an hour, it was very hard.  Right.  You know?  All right.  Yeah, this girl got nothing, and then all of a sudden, you know.  Why would he disclose you as rich?  That's the first thing I would say if I was rich.  Yeah, right. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  And I had, I looked at letters that my wife had received from different guys.  One guy wanted to start a new race.  I thought I asked me.  One guy wanted to start an experiment and was going to have super children and wanted to  start a new race.  Island of Dr. Moreau.  Oh, my God.  What a super race.  What a crazy world.  I like that.  Good idea.  Some of them wanted to get married on the side.  We can get married and stay by the beach, but we don't need to tell anybody.  That's a good idea.  A lot of abuse, a lot of abuse of girls over there. 
[00:49:00]  I would imagine.  But it worked out for you.  Good for you, Randy.  I'm good.  I'm happy.  All right, buddy.  Thanks for sharing.  Fascinating.  Great stuff going on.  Let's go to Justin in Ohio.  Justin.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I got a neighbor here in Canton that he's on his fourth Russian wife.  Wow.  He's done four Russian brides, your neighbor.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's been with her for like three, four years now.  But before that, he had three other ones that would come over. 
[00:49:30]  You'd see them.  They'd be there for a couple of weeks, two, three months at the most, and then they'd disappear.  There'd be no woman around for a couple of months, and then a new one would pop up.  He's killing them.  Oh, so maybe he just does this because he likes to fuck these hot Russian girls.  Maybe it's an arrangement he has.  That's true.  Well, this guy, you're saying there's a return policy?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  It was like the last dude was saying, you've got some magazine where you go through, it's  got photos, and you apply, and they send them over. 
[00:50:00]  And I guess it was just kind of like this show where he was testing them out, and then  if it didn't work out, he sent them back until he got one he liked.  Wow.  Jesus.  Who enforces that, though?  What do you call the customer complaint department?  Right.  This one's broken?  Yeah, my wife can't cook.  This thing won't fuck me.  Right.  Yeah, this thing is a fucking disgusting-smelling undercarriage. 
[00:50:30]  All right, Justin.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Now, someone else is asking the show you guys are watching, which I will absolutely start  watching, is it real?  People are saying, do you believe it's real?  Yeah, I do.  You do?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  Except, you know what's funny about that Russian chick that we think is scamming this  guy?  Like, she's the most obvious scammer because she hates him.  Yeah.  She's got something up her sleeve because not only does she know the language, but she  gets dialect.  Like, she was saying, yeah, she's just hanging out talking to these random girls. 
[00:51:00]  And nobody who just learned the language would say random like that.  She's very proficient in English.  Yeah.  And, yeah, yeah.  It is weird.  But I think that's less of producers trying to set something up.  Right.  And more of her being like, no, I'm going to really learn how they speak in America.  Right.  And then fuck someone over.  Yeah.  And then fuck someone over.  And the guy's sister is completely against this.  Oh, yeah.  And she's like, this girl is fucking scamming. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Well, they all see the writing on the wall.  Yeah.  Do you see the way they took her?  They took her to, he took her to a place that is like, oh, this is where we're going  to have our reception, a wedding reception.  And it's just some little dive place.  And the guy that owns the place is nice enough.  He's like, yeah, we could fit 40, you know, some odd people.  But it's like a little restaurant.  It's almost like a.  But it's like a restaurant.  A mom and pop TGI Fridays.  Right.  Right.  So, but she's like sitting there.  She's like, no, I had the idea of something more romantic. 
[00:52:00]  And, you know, this is not what I want.  Oh, God.  I don't want that.  She won't eat in front of people.  Yeah.  She has it.  Like, she wouldn't eat in front of his family.  Yeah.  And then he goes, well, you know, I mean, she doesn't really like it.  But I was thinking that once they brought the food out, that she would enjoy the food  and turn around.  You want to try some?  A little bite?  She won't have one bite of anything?  She's like, no.  Oh, no.  Which one was that again?  The Russian.  Oh, the Russian.  The one who really just treats him like shit.  Yeah, she is extremely cold.  Oh, they're all cold.  I've never met a Russian chick that I would want to date that was like, that had the accent. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  They all strike me as very, very bloodless, even though they might not be.  They never seem nice to me.  She's on a 90-day visa.  She's engaged.  She's marrying this dude.  Yeah.  And he starts talking about sex.  And she goes, I think we should wait.  No.  He goes, yeah, we've been talking for a while.  Like, they've been talking for over a year.  And she gets there.  And she's like, no, you know, I need to know him more.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  And any girl, if they're attracted to a guy that she's engaged to, would be fucking him right off the bat. 
[00:53:00]  There you go.  All right.  Yeah.  Fascinating.  What is it called again?  90 Day Fiance.  We're all in.  It's a really good show.  I'm going home and watching an episode as soon as I get home.  Oh, yeah.  And they replay it a lot, too, I think.  So you should be able to find it.  Jeff in Delaware.  Jeff.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Jeff?  I was looking like an idiot at the gym just with a big smile on my face the whole time.  That new podcast, man.  I don't know what happened to that character Jimmy did. 
[00:53:30]  The frown person.  I don't know.  I can't remember his name.  Oh, yeah.  It turned into something else.  Yeah.  Frank the Frowner.  Frank the Frowner.  Right.  Thank you.  Frank the Frowner became Ted Sheckler.  Yes.  Where he just pissed and shit for 15, 20 minutes and Bob Kelly kept throwing up to you.  Well, thanks, man.  I don't remember it, but I appreciate it.  Yeah.  This week's podcast is getting very good reviews.  It's called Super Puke with Bob Kelly, all the times he's puked on our show. 
[00:54:00]  Or a lot of the times, anyway.  And the bits around him puking are hilarious, too.  Not all the times he's puked.  Only the very best times.  Only the first two hours of his vomiting.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think we got all of them.  No.  That's for sure.  So go download our latest podcast.  Every Wednesday, a brand new Opie and Anthony podcast.  And this one seems to be doing very well.  Yeah.  It's called Super Puke with Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly puking.  There's very few things that make me laugh as hard as him vomiting.  That fuck, because it's so real and genuine.  Right.  Oh, Voss is a bad puker, too. 
[00:54:30]  But Bobby is a faster puker.  Voss has to smell something gross or a fart.  Yeah.  Right.  But Bobby can literally just look at a photo of a roid and an asshole and begin vomiting.  And he will go right into vomit mode.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was fucking great.  Hey, I also watched Midnight Cowboy last night.  Right.  I'm just starting it.  And do you know who the fucking guy is with the glasses that blows Joe Buck in the movie  theater? 
[00:55:00]  Let me guess.  Because I'm picturing him.  I can picture him.  Yeah.  No.  He's the guy that played the fucking head of the network on Seinfeld.  Oh, so would you.  That's fucking Bob.  Bob Balaban?  Balaban.  That's Bob fucking Balaban.  It didn't even.  I couldn't even figure.  I'm looking going like.  And then after I found out, I'm like, no fucking way.  That's Bob Balaban.  Which is odd because that's Jon Voight in the part.  You know, Jon Voight's car and fucking. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let me go back to that bald picture.  That guy.  Look at this.  Go move his up to the glasses.  Take his bald head out of it.  That fucking mouth.  That's, you know.  Yeah.  That's the guy.  That's the guy, huh?  I'm like, holy shit.  Yeah, that guy was in, like, Close Encounters and shit like that.  Very fucking.  All right.  He was on Seinfeld last night on TBS.  Yeah, there you go.  A good strong back, Joe Buck.  Oh, God.  That fucking guy.  We got to take a break.  Got to talk about the Biebs.  More Rob Ford. 
[00:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  The congressman apologized, but he's just a fucking douchebag.  Period.  But he'll explain why he wanted us.  That's him.  That's him.  That's, yeah.  That's the real him, not the apologetic guy.  The guy that's threatening some little wormy fucking reporter.  That didn't even ask anything too crazy, to be honest with you.  No.  Just ask the fucking question.  More within his means to ask that.  Of course.  And then, um, ah, the shit. 
[00:56:30]  We'll figure it out.  Oh.  It's Phil Collins' birthday.  Whoa.  And his music was in American Psycho.  And it's Christian Bale's birthday.  Wow.  That's weird, sir.  Bravo.  63 for that curmudgeon.  Yeah.  He was a dick.  We met him once.  He was a dick.  I was trying to be, I was out of my mind, because I listened to a lot of Phil Collins and  Genesis when I was a child of the 80s.  Yeah, Phil was a douche.  And then we got to meet him, and I was trying to be cool, and he just didn't want to have 
[00:57:00]  it.  Yeah.  Christian Bale from Empire of the Sun.  Holy shit.  He was just a kid.  Yeah.  He's been acting his entire life, man.  Unbelievable.  He is fucking great, Christian Bale.  He really is.  He was unbelievable in American Hustle.  Yeah, that was good.  And I don't like him as Batman, but it's not that he stinks.  I just don't like the choice he made.  It's not like you couldn't do it different.  I just don't like where he decided to go with it.  I think he did a good Batman.  I hate him.  Is that like the...  That's just...  And again, it's not like while he's lame, it's just like I wish he would have chose a 
[00:57:30]  different role.  Well, they had to make a cartoony.  I think when he was out of the Batman suit, he had quite a performance.  As Bruce Wayne.  He's great.  Yeah, absolutely.  But you know they got to fucking be goofy with the other...  When he's in the suit.  I had a little...  I had a little...  Contact with a major celebrity on Twitter.  Whoa.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Gavin McCloud.  Wow.  That was real?  Yeah, as far as I can tell.  Is he verified? 
[00:58:00]  He's not verified.  Neither was Gary Berghoff.  Heartbreaking.  I think that's...  I know Gary Berghoff wasn't real.  I knew that.  I figured he wasn't, but there was a couple of things.  Something tells me Patton Oswalt, even though...  Yeah.  I don't know why I think that.  It was just too politically incorrect.  It just was.  Oh, that sucks.  I don't know.  I didn't know this.  It was heartbreaking, dude.  It was heartbreaking.  Because it's so funny.  I mean, the stories about Alan Alda and shit like that. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  But I noticed everything he posted was just shit that was already available online.  There was nothing that he didn't have any personal pictures or video clips that he would put up of anything that wasn't already just online.  Right.  You know, that's a good point.  And one thing that did kind of make me go, huh, was he tweeted to me, yeah, I liked you on Tough Crowd.  I remember I went there one day, and Quentin Higgs was the warm-up guy, because he was.  We went backstage to see Colin, but he was too busy. 
[00:59:00]  And a couple things tipped me off.  First of all, you wouldn't be too busy to see Gary Berghoff.  But second of all, I would have heard that when I was on Tough Crowd.  Of course.  Radar from Ash was here.  Yeah.  And I never heard that.  I'm like, that's weird.  Who do you think it is?  I thought Patton.  I don't know why I thought Patton for some reason.  It seems like something he would do.  Somebody, maybe because of the Tough Crowd tie-in, he was on a couple times, or a bunch  of times, or Colin.  It's one of those guys.  Colin.  That'd be hilarious.  Right. 
[00:59:30]  Well, I don't know about Gavin McCloud.  Who the fuck knows if it's real.  But there was a picture that he posted yesterday of the love vote.  Right.  The Pacific princess apparently is laying on its side in some shipyard.  Ready to be just disassembled.  Really?  And ripped apart.  So they had a bunch of pictures of it.  But it was tipped over, squeezed between two other ships.  Right.  It's amazingly huge. 
[01:00:00]  And, you know, it's just there.  So I just put a nice parking job stooping.  And he said, well, I gave it a try.  So it was like our little exchange.  Did you see the picture, though?  Punch up the picture of the love vote.  Because here's what happens.  You know, remember the love vote?  The love vote.  And they show the ship.  There it is.  Wow.  That's the love vote.  We just don't feel like saving any shit.  No.  You would think they could do something with that.  Scrap it.  Even cut it up.  Just have it somewhere. 
[01:00:30]  People could walk around and check it out or something.  But I don't know.  Nothing on there is probably like the set.  Because a lot of it was probably sets.  Yeah.  True.  They have other pictures of people when they were using it as a cruise ship.  You know, they were up by the pool and hanging out.  And then you realize it's just, yeah, look, it's sailing.  And there it is just laying on its side.  Waiting to be hacked up into pieces.  Why was it parked like that?  I don't know.  It just kind of pulled in.  Pulled in and it's like tilted. 
[01:01:00]  It's old.  Yeah.  What year was that?  Like 75, 77?  Oh, Christ.  That's an old fucking ship right there.  Speaking of ships, the shit ship has come in.  The shit ship came in to Jersey.  Oh, New Jersey.  And of course, anytime something happens, the press just waits for the passengers to get  off so they can get their quotes.  I don't know.  Awful.  These cruise companies are fucking greedy.  Yeah.  Because I heard they were only giving a 50% discount.  I guess they figure, because they did have some good time. 
[01:01:30]  Supposedly only two.  Two days and then I heard all hell started breaking those two days in.  Yeah.  And by the third day, you couldn't even go to the emergency area or see a nurse or anything  like that.  It was all full up.  Right.  Was it all flu?  Is that what it was?  Or a food poisoning?  Dude, they were shitting and puking.  Oh, you got something on this, Kenny?  Half price on this cruise and half price on another cruise.  Oh.  Sure.  So they're giving you a new cruise for 50% off.  Okay.  So they're giving half their money back now, and then if they take another cruise, they 
[01:02:00]  get the other half.  I got you.  Uh-huh.  But that's a way to save some money, because you know a lot of those people aren't going  to take a cruise anytime soon.  Sure.  After shitting your brains out for five, six straight days.  That's awful.  And most people don't just go on cruises like a couple of times a year.  You plan for years a lot of these people to go on these.  But you see what they did there?  Because they knew they would save money if they did it that way.  Right.  They should just give a 100% fucking...  A refund.  A refund.  Yeah, they got to pay those motherfuckers. 
[01:02:30]  What is it?  What does it happen to?  Someone gets one flu or something and it just goes around?  Is that what it is?  Or is it a fucking...  It's not the flu?  Yeah, it's a virus.  It's a fucking...  A virus just hits the shit.  That shit on something that size, so many people jam together.  You're touching a lot of the same stuff.  It's so easy to spread something around like that.  Do they wear masks, people, or no?  No.  Like, I mean, they should have them.  Should they have them on board?  Oh, you mean if...  Asians do.  They love those masks.  Oh, you mean if...  If some people start getting sick...  Right. 
[01:03:00]  Then you can throw your mask on.  They quarantine the people.  When you get sick and you go see somebody on the ship, they will put you in your room,  put a fucking quarantine sticker on it, and you're not allowed to leave your goddamn room.  Did you see any of those when you went on a cruise?  Yeah, there were a couple of quarantines.  Oh, my God.  If somebody, you know, pukes somewhere or something, they lock them up.  But we're all selfish.  So let's say you come down with a little stomach thing and you're on a cruise ship.  You're not going to say that.  I'm not telling anyone.  I don't want to be fucking quarantined.  Do they give you money? 
[01:03:30]  If they quarantine you, what is the motive for you to tell?  Because, like, your cruise is ruined.  And so will they say, like, look, we'll give you a little money off your next cruise.  You have to stay in your room.  Oh, no.  Okay, so then why would you?  That's a mistake they make.  You're locked up.  Why would you at that point?  Why would you tell them?  It's the law of the sea.  Because they lock you up and then they don't really do the right thing in the end.  Right.  Because the mistake people make is like, oh, I got a little stomach.  I'm going to go down to the nurse's station.  And then all of a sudden the red lights go off.  And next thing you know, they're hauling you back to your room and putting that sticker on the door. 
[01:04:00]  I'm going to go shart in the jacuzzi.  Fuck.  I don't shart in it.  I just give a good whirsch.  Oh, a good whirsch.  I know why they wouldn't, by the way.  I take my hand sideways and give my crack a good quick whirsch.  Fuck.  Because people would be faking sickness just to get another cruise.  Right.  So that would make sense.  Yeah.  A bunch of dishonest people.  Where's that clip?  Oh, it's on my Instagram.  Yeah.  Get that clip.  I want to hear that.  I found it on the news last night. 
[01:04:30]  I was watching the news.  And they were interviewing some of these people getting off the ship.  And apparently it's just terrible.  There were a bunch of old people on this cruise.  All right.  Sam's finding the clip.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Bobo.  How are you doing, guys?  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  What do you want?  You guys were talking about my tweeting yesterday when I was saying that I had won that date with  that calendar girl.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  And I wanted to talk about that.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You guys didn't talk to me yesterday because I didn't get the call in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, you're here now.  What do you got?  What?  I was going to let you guys know, yes, that it's true.  I didn't win that date.  And I'll be posting pictures and stuff when it happens.  All right.  Yeah.  I'll have videos about how it went.  Okay.  All right, guys. 
[01:05:30]  I guess you guys didn't seem interested today.  We're in the middle of something.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of something there, Bobo.  Right now, we're in the middle of something.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'll see you guys at Super Show 2.  All right.  Bye.  I can't wait until this date happens.  A week from tomorrow is Super Show 2.  Anyway, so here's the clip from the shit ship. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  They were talking to a bunch of the passengers that got off.  And this is one of those, any time a cruise leaves from Jersey, I'm sorry.  What?  I don't know.  There's something about being bundled up in winter coats.  But it's convenient.  I'm looking at it.  You know?  Yeah.  I just have to go to Bayonne, and then in a couple of days, I'm in the Caribbean.  Are they the same ships as you have Miami and stuff?  The same ones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  I don't know.  What's the best cruise line?  I don't know.  You can ask Iraq.  The Royal Caribbean is very good. 
[01:06:30]  You know, even though they had this shit ship.  You can't avoid that.  No.  No.  There's no way to avoid people getting sick.  And you hear what they're doing?  Yeah.  They're hosing the whole fucking...  We talk about this all the time.  Yeah.  They're hosing down the whole ship.  Hosing meaning cleaning it from top to bottom.  And getting it ready for a ship that's leaving tomorrow.  Load it up.  They aren't wasting any fucking time.  Yeah.  God, being sick on a fucking boat like that, man.  Seasick.  Well, this guy's wife, that happened to him.  Her.  John, Jersey, what's up? 
[01:07:00]  Hey, what's up?  Yeah.  My wife and I were on a cruise ship.  You know?  Like, we had one of them big suites in the back.  Paid over $12,000.  Twelve days we're on the ship.  Like, the first day we're there, we're drinking and stuff.  And the next thing I know, the second day, she starts shitting herself.  And we go down to the infirmary.  And we go down there.  And the lady goes, how many times have you been shitting?  And my wife told, said 20, but the next, more like 50.  So then they said, okay, you're out quarantined.  And me, I was like, do I have to be in there too with her? 
[01:07:30]  And they said, nope.  And I said, okay, perfect, man.  It was like a beautiful first five days of vacation.  Oh, shit.  You ditched his wife.  Yeah.  So wait a minute.  You had to sleep in the room with her, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  I slept in a room with her.  She's got a suite.  You got a butler.  He was like her ship husband.  That guy's running all over the ship, getting her soup and stuff.  I didn't have to do anything for her.  Because he's my butler.  Wait a minute.  How do they know that she's not going to leave, though?  How do they prevent you from leaving? 
[01:08:00]  Nothing.  I guess like an honor system or something.  You have, especially somebody like this guy with a really nice suite.  And the staff is really attentive.  They know where the fuck you are at all times.  If you're supposed to be in your room, they know when you're in your room or not in your room.  Yeah.  And they're going to tattle on you.  They'll tattle.  Of course they will.  A bunch of tattletales.  They don't want that shit spreading.  Yeah.  But why would they let me roam all over the room?  I don't know.  That doesn't make sense.  That doesn't make sense.  Because you're technically not sick. 
[01:08:30]  That's true.  She was lucky that you had a nice suite.  You guys got the money.  Imagine being in just an okay room.  Oh, fucking one of the lower cabins without a window.  Right.  They have a porthole.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  They got the ones with the little porthole in the side, a little round window right over  the water.  You're the first person to die if the boat sinks.  Yeah.  How are those suites?  Are they really nice?  They are so fucking nice.  Certain suites are...  It's like an apartment.  This one's like a hotel room.  This is at the back of the ship. 
[01:09:00]  Because it's...  But you have a full-size tub, you know, and a full-size bathroom.  Yeah.  And it's like with a king-size bed or a queen-size bed.  Yeah.  A big, giant fucking balcony, a fucking jacuzzi on the balcony.  Oh, you do have a balcony.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, no, we didn't have a jacuzzi.  Not at all.  We're in the back of the ship.  Fucking bum.  Hey, wait.  Back in front of the ship better.  It doesn't matter.  Hey, we're in the back of the ship, and I just felt the prop the whole time.  What do you think?  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  What's better?  I like the fucking middle of the ship.  That's where I was.  Right in the middle.  What do you mean you felt the prop?  You know, the propeller.  Fucking...  What kind of old ship were you on?  They have those pods now where you don't even feel it.  All right.  It's something vibrate.  All right.  Like the engine and the helmet.  Good story, John.  Maybe it's your wife fucking the butler.  Exactly.  Or no, you're just fucking shitting.  Wait, what was Otto's joke?  He was saying something about a girl with her period, and she had diarrhea.  She sounded like a motorboat in full throttle. 
[01:10:00]  Disgusting.  The great Otto.  Yes.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Let's listen to this clip.  Oh, right.  The clip from the guy in the...  People are leaving the shit ship, and some of these guys had things to say.  Yeah.  The behavior of fellow passengers.  It was brutal.  It was downright brutal.  It was unfortunate.  That's the only reason why I wanted to get off the boat, because all the you-know-whats  on the boat.  It was downright rude and disrespectful.  The look the reporter gives after the tape piece. 
[01:10:30]  The you-know-whats.  The you-know-whats?  Yeah.  Are they the typical you-know-whats?  I don't think so.  Would it be the number one answer if we were playing Family Feud?  If you're playing Family Feud...  What would it be the number one answer?  The top 100 answers to this question.  What do you equate to you-know-whats?  Wow. 
[01:11:00]  No, I don't think he meant that.  It came off very weird.  Right.  Do you-know-whats?  I don't think he meant assholes or old people.  Okay.  They showed a fuckload of old people.  That would maybe be the fifth answer.  That would be the fifth answer on the board.  They showed a bunch of old people getting off this boat.  Like, this boat was packed with old people.  Right.  And I'm sure they aren't very patient or nice.  Old people, they get this thing where if they're inconvenienced, they don't give a shit 
[01:11:30]  anymore.  They figure, fuck it.  I'm just going to mouth off and tell these people to go fuck themselves.  Right.  I've been on this earth long enough.  Right, right, right.  And I deserve better.  They don't give a shit that they're taking up all the time at the pharmacy counter.  They love standing there chit-chatting with the pharmacist.  Do you get annoyed at that?  Oh, my God.  I cannot tell you.  It's the worst.  I cannot even fucking tell you.  When I step up there to get my Propecia so my follicles don't fall out. 
[01:12:00]  I.  Yes.  Does that shit work?  Oh, yeah.  Yo, Propecia.  I don't know.  My follicles are still in.  But why would they fall out?  I don't know.  If you keep going bald.  You have folliculitis.  No, you keep fucking.  But don't you know the line of your baldness?  And then you get all that filled in?  Yeah, but what happens if the fucking.  Line starts moving?  Behind the Maginot line. 
[01:12:30]  What happens if you get flanked?  Okay.  If baldness flanks out your front line, you're fucked.  I see my problem areas, and I know it's not going to go any further than that.  It's pretty obvious when you look in the mirror after a while.  I know, too.  You're like, oh, okay, that's my line.  I know, too.  I just like keeping it, you know.  Keeping it all together?  I keep it real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you stand there at the pharmacy.  But the plugs aren't going to fall out.  No, no, no.  Those are permanent.  So you admitted their plugs.  They stay there forever.  It's about time you admitted their plugs.  I just fessed to the fact that people will call them that, even though they're individually 
[01:13:00]  placed, individual follicles.  Why did that company go out of business?  They didn't.  I thought they did.  No, they merged with Bosley.  Oh, okay.  They merged with Elmer's.  And a rug company.  Exactly.  Elmer's and Huffman Coos.  Huffman Coos.  Oh, shit.  An animal pelt company.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  With the company that sells fucking coonskin caps.  The spokesman is the guy who played the big ragu on the Harn and Shirley.  No.  Merge with the helmet company.  No.  Oh, I swear.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Those, uh...  But the old people at the...  Just the other day.  Yeah.  Behind some old guy, and he's just chit-chatting with the fucking woman behind the counter.  Chit-chatting.  And, uh...  I'm staring at me like, what?  Get the fucking move. 
[01:14:00]  And then when they're done with the transaction, they're looking in the bag.  They're fucking getting shit together.  Move.  People in general, and it's not just old people, don't know how to put their shit back together.  No.  Uh...  After their purchase.  No.  I always feel like that guy.  I don't want to be in anyone's way.  So if I have shit out...  Right.  I just take all my shit, and I move a lousy foot to the right...  Move it.  ...which signals, your turn.  You can now step up.  But these people have to put all their crap right back together. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, they've got to rearrange everything.  They're fucking working a Rubik's Cube.  It's unbelievable.  Get the fuck out of the way!  It's annoying.  I don't know why people don't notice other people when they're out and about.  Yes.  Old people, I'll tell you what, there's old people.  They know that after this futzing of the receipts, and straightening of the bills, and looking  at the pills, it's the walker back to being alone and smelling their own skin falling off.  Okay, fair enough.  A family that won't talk to them. 
[01:15:00]  Neighbors that are young and viral and loud.  They live a life of terror and loneliness.  Right.  And the only connection they feel is the young pharmacist when they go...  Could I take this in the morning?  And they go, yes, you can.  Valuable person.  Sure you can.  I care.  Person who is still worthy of my time.  You're not alone.  I'm right here talking to you.  Okay.  Let me just futz around and put away my receipts.  Because once we lose eye contact, I won't see anybody for a week. 
[01:15:30]  Holy shit.  That's exactly...  To me, it is the worst.  And I feel guilty.  But you're 100% right.  They do annoy me, though.  But they're the only ones I don't get as annoyed at, because I'm like, after this, they are  probably going home to be by themselves.  That transaction means everything to them.  Yeah, man.  To us, it's just like, God, fuck, I gotta go to the drugstore.  You get all mad. 
[01:16:00]  But to them, it's everything.  That's their social life.  Yeah.  That is...  Picture you going to the best fucking party...  Sure.  ...that you've ever been to.  That's what that is to them.  Oh, God.  That's me getting to talk to Ozzy somewhere.  Right.  And fucking just other people standing behind going, come on already, I gotta talk to Ozzy.  Hurry up, get out of here.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'm here.  This is important.  Important stuff.  Is this twice a day?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's written on the fucking label.  Now move your shit.  Just all the things that you want to say to somebody else, their toenails bother them, 
[01:16:30]  and they figure there's a person who has answers.  My toenails are falling off.  What do I do about my moderate to severe psoriasis?  Yes.  Talks like that.  Moderate to severe.  I'm having trouble handling my moderate to severe.  Talks like that.  Why don't you just let it go at that point?  Right?  I would assume.  Should be an ad for Smith & Wesson.  It's your solution, Dunstan.  Here it is.  Here you go.  And there's a metal hat that comes with it to keep the ceiling pristine. 
[01:17:00]  Take one by mouth.  Do you know how much they would...  They would poo-poo a product.  If it was a suicide assistant, a big, a tight-fitting solid steel hat that kept the bullet from going through the ceiling.  Oh, that's scandalous.  Oh, they would poo-poo it. 
[01:17:30]  That dull thud of a bullet hitting solid ship steel.  And a little vent in the side so it can leak out onto your neck.  Jesus.  Oh, fuck.  Hey, I love it.  Ah, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You know, you got to deal with it.  I don't...  I don't...  I'm not courteous to the old people because of the fact that that's all they got going. 
[01:18:00]  It's more so I don't know what they've done in their very long life.  And, you know, if you're just, like, yelling at some old guy over something trivial and you realize he was fucking holding his buddy's guts in on the beaches of Normandy or something, you're kind of a fucking asshole.  I actually give him a pass every time.  I do give him a pass.  I give him a pass every time.  I'm still annoyed, but...  It annoys the piss out of me.  I don't say anything.  But I don't say anything.  Not me.  I bully him.  Do you? 
[01:18:30]  I grab him by their shirt collars.  Give him a good bullying?  Yeah, or I'll just start shaking him and I'll go, hurry up!  Imagine how scared he'd be.  Oh, the poor fella.  I know.  No, I go behind them and I grab their shoulders and shake them and they just drop everything on the pharmacy counter.  They get all nervous.  Their dog is yelping at me.  I'll tell you someone that doesn't tolerate old people.  That would be Tony Danza.  Oh, Tony Danza, right.  Tony Danza.  You don't want to hear it.  I was leaving our gym, me and Jimmy's gym the other day, and the elevator was full. 
[01:19:00]  You know when you're walking down and those doors are closing?  Yep.  And this old lady, I say old, she was in her 70s, and she decides to do the right thing.  She sees me and another guy, and she decides to hit that button to reopen the doors, and  I get in, and all I see is Tony Danza.  He doesn't recognize me because I got my hat on.  I got this stupid beard right now.  And he goes, Jesus Christ, what are you, go for employee of the day?  And not being, not kidding.  He was so fucking mad that this lady hit that open the door button. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, you're not the boss of me.  Who's the boss?  What, are you going to go catch a taxi?  Oh, good one, good one.  And then he wouldn't let it go for the, what amounts to a 10-second elevator ride.  He just kept going.  Oh, jeez, you work here?  You're going for employee?  He kept going with employee of the day.  And everyone, the elevator was packed, they were all so uncomfortable, because it was  an older lady.  Right.  It wasn't a dude or something where you go, oh, come on, what the fuck? 
[01:20:00]  I don't like those button-pushing martyrs, though.  But it's an old lady.  Don't push the fucking button.  All right.  Are you going to react like Tony Danza did?  No.  Okay, good.  And then, like.  But don't push the fucking button.  And then the lady starts to, well, I'm really sorry.  And he's like, ah, jeez, that button, you know.  Or a cunt in him in the face.  Exactly.  Hey, my personality.  Where did my talk show go?  I got such a bubbling personality.  Thoughts and prayers to the person that missed the elevator.  Exactly.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers. 
[01:20:30]  But he fucking, she opens the door for Opie and all of a sudden, he's fucking an asshole.  But he really just snapped quickly.  And then, of course, I have to, like, bounce it out.  So I'm like, thank you very much, man.  That was very nice of you.  And he's like, I could feel him in the back.  Like, fuck you, too?  Yeah, he's like.  Very, very busy man.  He probably was in a hurry.  But the funny part about that, and I think it's for everyone.  Now, I thought that was awesome.  Right, right.  But if I'm in the elevator and she did it for somebody else, I would be pissed, too.  You're pissed.  But I wouldn't be vocal about it.  Yeah.  In that instance, because, you know, it's an old fucking frail lady. 
[01:21:00]  I do not like that fucking move when people hit that button.  Unless they do it for you.  And then you're happy.  Well, yeah.  That's human nature right there, though.  How about they hit the button, right?  Yeah.  They let the person in, and the person hits the floor right below the one you're to get  on.  Then it's like, oh, double whammy.  Oh, I don't know how.  Yeah.  It annoys me, too.  And I shouldn't.  I'm listening to you, and I'm like, it is irritating.  It's so annoying. 
[01:21:30]  But it's like, it really is seconds out of your...  I wouldn't say anything to her, just because she's old, but I would just start mumbling  out loud.  Someone's going to get their head caved in as soon as this elevator stops.  It was just how he went from zero to ten that quickly over something, you know.  Just nonsense.  And then wouldn't let it go.  Tony Danza.  No, I hate elevators, yeah.  Not quite the...  I hate when people get on to do the one-floor thing when you're like, there's a fucking 
[01:22:00]  staircase.  No one takes the stairs.  One lousy floor, you can't take the staircase?  And sometimes they don't know if that door locks behind you.  No, it's...  Like it's stuck in the stairwell.  It's the obvious ones where you're like, seriously, I saw the staircase.  Yeah.  You really couldn't just walk one stupid level down?  Yeah.  Jimmy Kimmel.  He does some terrific things on the internet and with his TV show.  Yes. 
[01:22:30]  He did a video where he asked everybody about the State of the Union, which just happened.  Uh-huh.  Problem is, he asked them before it happened.  Oh.  He does this bit from time to time.  This cocksucker really comes up with some funny stuff, man.  It's a very smart bit.  That's a really fucking good bit.  Here it is.  Wow.  What did you think of the State of the Union last night?  It was awesome.  I loved it.  Oh, jeez.  What did you think of President Obama's State of the Union address last night? 
[01:23:00]  You know, it had different effects on different people.  And, you know, I just feel those effects affect everybody.  You know, like, you just got to be positive.  You got to not focus on the negative.  What did you think of President Obama's State of the Union address last night?  I thought it was powerful.  I thought that he laid out a lot of the same sort of policies he's been laying out all along.  Did you notice that John Boehner kept falling asleep?  I did.  I'm not sure if he was actually asleep or just resting his eyes, as they say.  But, yeah, it's not the best thing to see on national television. 
[01:23:30]  But there we go.  So you stayed up and watched the whole thing?  Not the whole thing.  Now, you would think this guy is a plant.  You would think someone like Jimmy Kimmel, it's a good bit.  And then you've got to get a couple plants to really push the bit forward, right?  But, after listening to Pendulet the other day, I'm not so sure.  Because he described this exact thing.  When there's TV cameras and stuff, you don't want to disappoint the person, so you'll just, you'll subconsciously give them what they're asking for. 
[01:24:00]  Or, how about a little pre-setup before they actually, like before this, she says, hey, we're doing on the street interviews.  And he's like, oh, you want to participate?  Oh, of course.  Yes, yes.  And then she goes, it's going to be about the State of the Union address.  I didn't watch it.  Right.  All right.  Well, look, I'll just talk to you.  Just say you watched it.  All right.  Okay.  Now you've got a guy that isn't a plant, really.  It's kind of set up, but they're winging it. 
[01:24:30]  Because I don't, why would he do this?  I'm not, because I think Jimmy Kimmel might have blew it with this guy, because it's too much of the same guy.  Or maybe they got.  Where you're like, there's no way a guy would fake it to this level.  Right.  50 people who said no.  Maybe there's 50 people that said no.  No, I didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  And we're always only seeing the guys that said, yeah, there's not.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  There seems to be more to this.  No, I think there's more to it.  That's what I'm, that's why I wanted to stop this.  Yeah, there's some type of setup.  All right.  Well, thanks.  I was, again, pretty tired, but Mike caught, you know, the middle 20th. 
[01:25:00]  So, yeah.  And what do you think of the weird tie that Obama was wearing last night?  I mean, I support the weird tie.  That's what I do.  I support trying to be kind of like a, kind of get different with his fashion.  But yeah, it was kind of weird.  But I support it because I'm kind of weird myself.  For people who didn't see it, can you describe what it looked like?  Something I would wear to the bingo hall with my grandma to be funny.  It was kind of like.  Betty Boop?  Yeah, Betty, that's a good word for it.  Betty Boop.  What did you think of President Obama's State at the Union address last night? 
[01:25:30]  I thought it was pretty good.  But as a young person myself, I can only question it so far because.  Fucking Hollywood.  He believes about what's going on.  Just the gay capital of the world.  What specifically was good about it?  Just that he was addressing what everybody was talking about.  Which is what?  I don't know.  I don't think he's even there.  Where were you when you watched it?  In a hotel room.  And did you watch it with anyone? 
[01:26:00]  My wife.  And what did she think of it?  Well, she was pretty much nodding off and sleeping.  Did you think that there was too much product placement in the State of the Union?  Yeah, that kind of surprises me.  Kind of cheapens politics a little bit.  Who lied more last night?  The president or you?  Who?  I'm asking you.  Pause real quick.  The questions sound like they're being ADR'd, I think.  I believe that's what it is.  Or AV or whatever it's called.  I should know that.  In post?  Yes.  You can hear the...  It's a little bit... 
[01:26:30]  It almost sounds like they're in a studio.  But she...  They're probably just modifying her questions in post.  Right.  Like she's not saying who lied last night more, you or him.  Right.  They probably did ask about the State of the Union.  And they probably...  Or just...  No, certain questions.  I don't like this piece.  Or just setting it up like...  I think it's...  Okay.  Here's one of the setups they could do.  Hey, how you doing?  We want to talk about the State of the Union.  It's not till tomorrow, though.  But we're going to air this the day after. 
[01:27:00]  So we're just going to ask some vague questions about it.  And then we'll air it after the State of the Union takes place.  So go.  Hey, you see the State of the Union?  Yeah, I did.  There's so many ways to set this up.  Or they're asking about last year's State of the Union.  Or they're going, did you see last year's State of the Union?  Oh, right.  Last year's State of the Union.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I think it's something going on.  It's like, yeah, just go with it and be like, yeah, I saw it.  This isn't just someone stepping up to this microphone, cold, her asking, did you see the State of the Union last night? 
[01:27:30]  And them going off like this.  There's something set up that isn't being shown.  They're pumping it up.  Yeah.  I don't like this one.  Kimmel usually does a pretty good job, but I'm not buying this.  And keep in mind that Kimmel came from radio.  Right.  And the man on the street pump up questions is a very radio thing.  Very radio.  I would have said, yeah, I've seen the fucking nukes.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's see a little more of this.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  Probably me.  What did you lie about?  The fact that I saw all of it, because I was nodding off. 
[01:28:00]  So did you see any of it?  Oh, I saw most.  No, I'd say half of it.  So you're not lying about seeing half of it?  No.  Okay, so what did you think about Obama faking the heart attack at the end?  I think that was more for shock value, not, you know, sympathy or what have you, but  just to get the right.  I mean, yeah, he did get shocked when they brought that defibrillator.  Exactly.  What did you think of President Obama's State of the Union address last night?  It was all right.  Oh, my God.  What was your favorite part of it? 
[01:28:30]  The end.  Do you think that Joe Biden embarrassed himself last night?  Very much so.  Could you, like, were you shocked when you saw that, or?  I was pretty shocked when I saw him fall asleep.  Like, that was not, that was not good.  Can you describe what you saw?  Okay, guys.  They're hilarious.  Kind of naughty now.  I'll be honest.  Kind of like he was on drugs.  Maybe.  And then what?  That he just fell asleep.  But that's also like in the, when you were talking about the ADR or whatever, that she 
[01:29:00]  could have said, were you shocked to see Joe Biden?  Yeah, he fell asleep.  Yeah.  Cut that part of the question out.  You know what I mean?  And so when he says, yeah, he fell asleep, it sounds like he's just coming out of nowhere  and lying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obama do.  He continued.  I was pretty much not even looking at Obama by that point.  There wasn't much going on besides watching the vice president.  Yeah, hard to concentrate.  Yeah, a little bit.  Totally.  Was there anything during the speech that made you angry? 
[01:29:30]  That it wasn't over quicker.  Why did you force yourself to watch it if you didn't want to watch it?  Well, it's important to be able to talk to people about things that are going on in our  generation.  You don't want to sound uneducated.  Even if they haven't happened yet?  Yeah, pretty much.  This hasn't even happened.  Has it?  That's awesome.  That's broken off.  Thank you so much for taking part in Live Fitness News.  You're welcome.  I think we all learned a valuable lesson.  I don't know. 
[01:30:00]  Something's going on there.  He just does a good job.  I don't know.  He didn't pull that one off.  Okay, wait.  Maybe it's a combination.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure.  They may have said, do you see Obama's State of the Union address last night?  For people that went, it wasn't last night.  Goodbye.  Some people probably went, no.  No, no.  What happened?  Well, we're just talking to people who've seen this.  They just act like you saw it.  Right.  So then he's like, oh, it didn't happen yet.  So they may have only fed them a little bit, but they told them you're going to lie.  That's kind of what you said.  And then you get a couple that, like, you get hook, line, and sticker, no matter what. 
[01:30:30]  What is it with the gay guy and that voice thing?  What is with that voice thing?  Is it genetic?  Like, people say, you don't learn to be gay.  You're born gay.  Everyone says, you know, a lot of gay advocates and everything say, no, you're born gay.  There's nothing you can do about it.  So when you're born gay, do you get this something in your DNA that makes you talk like that? 
[01:31:00]  No, it's probably learned.  That part's probably learned, almost like growing up Italian.  Learned by who?  It's like a bionics.  No, being good.  Well, I'm similar.  Yeah.  And all of your role models are a certain way.  Like, somebody pointed out to me years ago, before there were gays on TV or you didn't  know anyone was gay, a lot of effeminate guys had to look up to.  They probably related more to the women in the scenes falling in love with the star.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the only thing.  I mean, there's some reason for it.  It's just a femininity to it.  I think you got the whole thing.  I think you got the gay voice. 
[01:31:30]  The gay voice.  I think you're just born with the gay face.  He has the gay face.  The gay face and voice.  I don't know.  It's probably a little of everything.  Are these gay guys that don't talk like that?  Well, yeah, there are.  But you said the other day that it's your theory that all gay guys would aspire to talk  like that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You said that every gay guy wants to be this guy.  I don't.  I don't agree with that at all.  I believe the majority of gay gentlemen want to be like this guy. 
[01:32:00]  Be out there just, I'm a gay man.  So you think there's gays that hold all that back?  Yes.  But don't you think there are a lot of gay guys that don't want to be defined by sexuality?  No.  You don't think so?  I don't think so.  Like the way you walk down the street and people are not like, that guy puts his dick  in vaginas.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You don't think there are gay guys that also wouldn't want people to immediately just  be like, oh, he's a Peter Popper.  Not many.  You know, that's not many. 
[01:32:30]  This also, some guys may pump it up a bit more because like when you're doing this, it's,  it's, it says that you're being open and free almost.  And I'm not saying all of them.  I'm not saying it's not natural.  Right.  But like if, if on a scale from one to 10, his natural voice would be say a six in that.  Uh-huh.  Maybe he, he subconsciously makes it a nine because that's being who I am and that's being  free and out and not hiding.  I don't know.  Maybe people exaggerate a little bit.  It just seems odd that there is a gay dialect, a gay accent. 
[01:33:00]  And there, there's something that when a gay man talks, there's this sound that you can  identify and go, I am right now.  I think that, I think that guy is gay.  It just, that there is that at all.  I'm not saying everybody or the majority, even I'm not saying guys are like, I don't  know how many, but just the fact that it is, that it exists at all is the very odd thing  to me.  Well, I think you're born with most of that voice.  You think?  Yeah.  And then maybe you pump it up a little bit. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  Fucking weird.  I think so.  I don't know.  But there are gay guys that don't sound anything like that.  Well, I know that.  And they're not holding the gay voice back.  They might be, you know, fucking McMillan and wife, that guy.  Right.  You think when he wasn't shooting shit that he sounded like that?  I bet when he was out with the guys, Rock Hudson, and there were a few cocktails going  in him.  He sounded more like that.  I bet this would come out a little bit.  Sure.  Same with Robert Reed. 
[01:34:00]  You know, you're not watching the Brady Bunch and seeing that, but I bet you.  I don't know if those are good examples, though, because they really had to like protect  their livelihood, which it was acting and acting in straight roles.  So, but that's what you're seeing.  You're not seeing maybe the honest.  But the gay is now way more accepting.  So you would think then if that's the case, then every gay guy would sound like that.  Because then why would they hide it anymore?  Maybe.  Maybe it's like when Search, when MC Search is talking to a black guy, he gets that whole 
[01:34:30]  black dialect, but when he's not, he sounds like the middle-aged Jewish gentleman he is.  Right.  See, he changes back and forth.  Maybe the gay guy, when he's just hanging out with, you know, your standard issue people,  he's talking like a regular guy.  And then when he gets around the gay friends at night, maybe that comes out like MC Search  and the black people.  Then they let it go a little bit.  Yeah.  I understand that part.  Yeah.  They let it fly a little bit.  I understand that part of it, but I don't think it's, I don't think they're holding back  to the point where they all sound like that. 
[01:35:00]  No, this guy's the way over the top, but it's there.  There is a definite, I mean, you could talk to anybody and say, all right, imitate how  a gay guy talks.  And they're all going to have the same kind of caricature.  We've got a gay guy in line.  Let's say hi to Dan in Wyoming.  Dan.  Dan.  What do you got on this, Dan?  Hey, guys.  Long time listener.  First time caller.  No one cares.  I'm just kidding, Dan.  All right.  So I just wanted to say that I am an openly gay guy, and I got to disagree with Anthony. 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  I have absolutely no ambition to talk like that or be like that, and I'm not holding  back anything.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We hear a little gay voice.  I hear a little gay.  Little gay.  Little gay is coming through.  Just a little.  Little.  Just a little.  You can hear it.  Like 10%.  I just be holding back.  Yeah?  When you get around your gay friends, I bet you talk a little differently. 
[01:36:00]  I really don't.  Not that I'm aware of.  I really don't.  I don't.  I don't.  I'm just fucking with you.  Well, not literally.  I'm just, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I believe this guy.  A lot of them do talk much more effeminate when they're around each other.  Me, personally, I don't.  How's that Wyoming for gays? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, fuck.  Not too...  It's exactly how you would expect it to be.  Not too supportive?  No.  Yeah.  It's better than it was 10 years ago.  Yeah.  You sound a little gay, sir.  I got to be honest with you.  I just got to be honest.  I'm not even kidding.  You sound a little gay.  But he doesn't sound like the guy from the Jimmy Kimmel piece.  No, he doesn't.  But I guarantee you, when he's hanging with his friends, after a few Cosmos, I guarantee  you...  Why does he have to drink Cosmos? 
[01:37:00]  What?  What do you drink, Dan?  I had Jack and Coke all the way.  Oh, that's your drink.  Who's Jack?  Exactly.  They do Coke.  He Jacks and Coke.  He just named your drink, Anthony.  No, I drink Captain Morgan and Coke.  Oh, Captain Morgan and Coke.  You're right.  You're right.  Because it's sweeter.  You're right.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Have fun being gay in Wyoming.  Dan the man.  Remember Tippy Tom?  I certainly do.  A gay homeless gentleman of ours who's no more with us. 
[01:37:30]  Matt reminds us of something.  Go ahead, Matt.  Yeah, I just remember when y'all talked to him when he was in the hospital and when he  was sober.  He sounded very gay.  Remember that?  It was so weird.  I do remember that.  We all know the Tippy Tom that's like, I'm dead.  I'm about to change.  I'm going to be.  But a raging alcoholic is holding back that gay voice.  Holding back the gay.  That goes against your theory.  Because then when he was laid up in the hospital completely sober and we talked to him on the  phone, he was like, well, I'm here at the hospital. 
[01:38:00]  Do we have that?  That was so creepy.  It was so.  All right, cut down.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  We couldn't believe we were talking to the same guy.  I know.  It was unbelievable.  He was sober for what, about a week or so?  Yeah, yeah.  And he was completely different.  Well, guys.  Let me say hi to Jesse in Kansas.  Jesse.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm gay.  Oh.  I like men and dance. 
[01:38:30]  I like a fag.  Oh, jeez.  And Anthony, you're right.  There is this voice that some of them adopt.  Yeah.  And they pick it up.  They're not born with that.  Is it picked up?  So, all right.  You're hearing this guy.  Yeah.  Do you think he's holding back a gay voice?  No.  Not maybe subliminally.  You don't hear the typical gay in his voice.  Or subconsciously.  I don't hear the typical gay.  But, again, maybe when he's out with his buddies and comes out. 
[01:39:00]  I don't have gay buddies.  I don't particularly like gay guys.  Oh, okay.  Well, he's a butch.  Oh, there you go.  I don't know.  You know, I think a lot of them, they hold it in for so long.  Yeah.  And then when they finally come out, I'm going to embrace this whole lifestyle.  That's been what I do.  Yeah.  Hey, how about then when you see some kid who's like fucking seven and you just look at...  You're trying to get him into the alley.  That's what...  No.  Uncle Paul wasn't going there.  Oh, I thought you needed advice.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  No, no, no.  Not at all.  You say, hey, there's puppies in here that need hugs.  Don't tell your mother.  No, no.  I wasn't talking about that.  I was talking about their voice.  Sometimes you'll see a kid that you kind of look and go, oh, I think, you know, his sexuality might not be heterosexual.  And then he's talking and he's got an effeminate lisp or something to his voice.  Now, where does that come from? 
[01:40:00]  That's a good question.  I really don't know.  He hasn't been influenced by other gay people, but that there's just something in the inflection.  When you're a kid, you kind of know, like, there's a gay kid.  Not always, but a lot of time.  But then again, I've thought wrong, too.  There's been quite a few people I thought were gay because they had that but weren't.  I was surprised to hear they were married.  I'm like, really?  That's a good question.  Like, how much of that is learned and how much are you?  Because if someone's seven and they're not being influenced.  Right.  Then where does that come from?  Then I guess that is whatever makes you gay. 
[01:40:30]  That's just the.  It is some kind of a.  Maybe it's a hybrid between masculine and feminine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Jesse.  Thank you.  Very interesting question.  Absolutely.  Let me.  Well, no, actually, let's go to Travis.  Travis found the Tibby Tom call.  Oh, I thought we were talking another gay gentleman.  Now, everyone knows how Tibby Tom usually sounds.  Yes.  Yes.  You guys want, like, an example of Tibby Tom?  We should get a quick example.  Let me just pull a random clip.  This one says Tibby Tom golden buns. 
[01:41:00]  Okay.  What about Barry Manilow?  Now, you lived with Barry Manilow?  Briefly.  Now, this is when you were, you know, golden buns, I guess.  Back when I was golden buns, well, I still got my buns.  Well.  But the thing is, you know, they're sagging a little bit.  But I'm still golden buns.  I got the nicest ass in this whole studio. 
[01:41:30]  And I'll tell you right now, I see everybody no ass.  Jimmy's got a nice ass.  No.  He was just simply amazing.  That shit is great.  That's a homeless dude.  He could stop drinking.  So then he had some kind of incident, and he had to go to the hospital.  Yeah.  And they weren't going to allow him to drink in the hospital.  So he was sober for, I think it was at least a week. 
[01:42:00]  And we called him in the hospital to check on him.  And this is the same guy.  Yeah.  This is the phone call.  Whenever you want to bow out, just let me know.  Yeah, yeah.  No problem.  But first, we got to go live to the hospital.  Our buddy, our pal, Tippi Tom.  How are you doing, Tom?  Hi.  How are you?  How are you feeling?  Oh, I'm feeling like a million bucks now.  I'm telling you, everything's just going fine.  Now, can you please explain to me, which one am I talking to? 
[01:42:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie?  Yeah, you're talking to both of us.  Wow.  No.  You sound even gayer when you're sober.  So it's two against one here.  No, we're not ganging up on you, Tippi Tom.  Wow, he does.  But, Tom, you've got to explain to us what happened to your foot.  Well, here's what happened.  About ten days ago, I was having a good time strolling down 14th Street, right?  He sounds so gay when he's sober.  And, you know, I was half-litter. 
[01:43:00]  I was, you know, I was just being just my normal thing.  Right.  But it was raining out.  So I wanted to get out of the rain.  And, you know, on 14th Street side or on 8th Avenue, they got that fancy new slick tile they're putting down that.  You know, they're spending $650 million to redo the subways.  I was reading about this.  Hey, Mario, can you give the phone to a Tippi Tom?  And the thing is this. 
[01:43:30]  As I was coming down the stairs, my foot slipped, and I went head over heels.  Ass over tea kettle.  Yeah, halfway down the stairs.  Yeah.  And I landed on my feet.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  One foot must have caught the corner of the stairs.  This can't be a sick guy.  And it ripped a good chunk.  Oh, it did.  Yeah.  So I had to get it fixed.  Yeah.  And then the other foot just got...  Holy crap.  Isn't that... 
[01:44:00]  It's the same guy.  It amazes me every time I hear it.  It's sad he didn't make it, man.  Died drunk.  Falling down the steps, actually.  Yep.  Falling down the stairs.  Another one of those falls.  As I'm hearing that, I'm hoping, like, God, there's that little hope.  Like, maybe it was a mistake.  Maybe it was another guy.  Maybe the time they talked about him falling down the steps is actually this time.  And there was an except, and Tom just got sober and left.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  It's the same guy.  All right.  Let me tell you what happened.  Who am I talking to?  There's something.  So it's two against one. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Right?  That's so weird.  I was walking down 14th Street.  So weird.  It's amazing.  14th Street.  And all of a sudden...  Wow.  Same fucking guy.  Two guys I used to work with came out, went in two weeks from normal accent to gay accent. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, really?  Greg Luganis is an example of the voice thing before and after he came out.  Oh, yeah?  I don't remember.  I just know Greg Luganis is Greg Luganis nowadays.  And then someone's saying, Rob Halford, do you think he wants to talk gay around other  gay people?  Rob Halford?  Because there's a guy that, you know, gave the impression he was, quote, all man.  But did he, though?  Like, you look back on those things, and you're like, I don't like...  Yeah, when you watch the old footage when he had, like, the blonde hair, and he was 
[01:45:30]  wearing the leather, helping for leather.  You're like, yeah, I see it.  Yeah.  Well, I guess now you understand, right?  Yeah, it's still great, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he...  And who could tell with that English accent?  Yeah.  They all sound a little mysterious.  Yeah, that kind of throws off the gay.  Right, right.  The gay a little bit.  Exactly.  Our gay friends, they have just slight gay voices. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah?  Slight.  Not over the top like that.  No.  You have gay friends?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I decided now that I'm a middle-aged man, I should be more accepting.  More accepting?  A little Macklemore?  You ever drink wine?  Like, all of a sudden, you're getting, like, loopy, and you feel one of them start rubbing  your feet?  You look tired, Greg.  And actually, I've had discussions with one of them, and he absolutely hates the over-the-top  flamboyant gay people.  See, that's like the black guy. 
[01:46:30]  He's one of these guys, he's all in with that bullshit parade and stuff.  He's like, it's the worst for our community.  See, I think a lot of people say that, but I don't think they mean it.  Dude, I've known this guy for 10 years.  I don't know.  You would think some of that shit would have came out by now, no?  I don't think.  Who knows?  You would think.  So, I was walking down on our team.  That's a very interesting question, though.  When you think about it logically, there isn't the quote-unquote gay accent that we can kind 
[01:47:00]  of associate.  Yeah.  Where does it come from?  I guess it's, but if it's a lot learned, if you grow up in a house where there's really  no gay influences, what is it in your DNA that says to behave that way?  I mean, there's always influences on TV, or you meet other gay dudes, or whatever.  No, but when you're six and seven, yeah, you're not really, you can tell sometimes.  I think it's part of your DNA.  Your voice maybe is just slightly a little different, for whatever reason.  I don't know.  But you don't know anything about sexuality at that age, so you don't know you're being  influenced by... 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, but you know who you relate to.  Like, you just have a natural...  So, it'll be the woman on TV, then?  Something like that.  The woman, yeah.  Maybe.  That I guess.  Maybe it's the woman, because I can't see...  Well, let's...  One more call.  Let's go to Alan in Florida.  Alan.  Hey, how you doing?  I have quite a tapestry of gayness in my life, but I'm a straight guy.  But recently, my wife has a cousin who just came and got from Spain via Cuba, and this  kid's about seven years old, and we have some other adults in the family that are gay, 
[01:48:00]  and even they laugh when they see this kid.  I mean, it's...  The kid's a flamely homosexual, and it's not 12, because he wasn't around gay people,  and his father's a pretty macho guy.  And he doesn't act like a girl.  Like, I'm thinking maybe it's a girl that's not the side of a boy's body.  No.  He acts like a gay adult.  It's fucking crazy.  He vogues, and does all these...  He vogues.  Is that what gay guys do?  Vogue.  He vogues. 
[01:48:30]  He...  And...  You got merengue on, man.  He starts shaking his ass like a chick.  But he's a seven-year-old kid, and he's definitely, definitely, no doubt about it.  And if he's not gay, he's going to be some weird motherfucker.  All right.  And I don't remember a lot of gay people.  Do you laugh at him?  We don't know.  Oh, God.  Never, never, never, never.  I mean, we don't even know if his parents are aware.  I don't really get to speak to the parents much, because they don't speak a word of English.  So...  But the father seems like a pretty macho guy, and they don't seem to, like, know, like... 
[01:49:00]  They don't really pay attention to their kid when we're at, like, family functions,  which is often.  Right.  They don't, like, seem like...  Like, you know, how, like, I'm all over my kid, you know?  And I don't know if they're just denying it, or if they're not aware.  I mean, it's obvious.  I mean, completely.  The old nature-nurture thing.  Sure.  The eternal question.  I think it's a combination.  Sure, in this case.  All right.  And as far as my childhood, I had a brother who was 50 years older than me, and he was  a flaming homosexual. 
[01:49:30]  And I grew up as an eight-year-old kid going to his buddy's house, who was his lover, and  having spaghetti and meatballs, because it was an awesome cookie.  Is that a euphemism for something?  No, no.  But I was around a lot of gay men as a small child.  And it never even occurred to me they were gay, because there was no sexuality that was  short in front of me, even though they talked a little funny, it wasn't, you know, they  weren't imposing anything on me as a child.  Right.  They were having spaghetti, they would drink a wine, it was, you know, like normal grown-ups, 
[01:50:00]  you know?  Clockwork Orange Meal.  Spaghetti and wine.  I know, right?  Try the wine.  I think we're all finally figuring out that gays aren't monsters.  Well, yeah.  We come from a time that might have been what was told to you.  The homosexual.  Remember that fucking movie?  Fast forward a few decades, and, you know, most of us believe they're not monsters, and  just because they're gay, they're not going to, like, hit on you.  Stay away from the homosexual.  His sick mind.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  You're like, what the fuck?  Yep.  Those are those old 50s films.  All right, Alan.  Good.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, Alan.  Someone brings up a good point.  Lesbians.  Lesbians that have the over-the-top gay voice.  Yeah, or the butch fucking...  But they definitely sound a bit more manly.  A little manly?  They go the other way with it, right?  Well, yeah, but...  Not all, though.  No, no.  Not as many as, like, you see the gay guys.  Like Ellen.  You watch Ellen.  It's not like, oh, she sounds like a lesbian.  Yeah, but the gay guy has been embraced. 
[01:51:00]  Like, it's a celebration.  Like, oh, yay, it's my favorite gays.  Nobody says that about, look at, my lesbos are here.  That's true.  But remember Taylor from the N.E.W. days out of Dallas?  She was in our contest, and she was ridiculously hot.  And I was convinced there's no way she was gay.  And we all tried it like Turner.  No.  And she just would not have it.  And I kept looking at her, like, there's no way you're gay.  She must not be.  She must be if she wouldn't have sex with anybody in this room. 
[01:51:30]  What woman could withstand this test?  Right?  Come on, ladies.  I hope I got her name right.  I think it was Taylor.  And I kept looking at this woman going, there's no way you are.  There was not a sign that she was, you know, a lesbian when you were just hanging out with her.  You know, she dressed like the other, you know, ridiculously over the top hot girls that did our show and all that.  And she acted the part, like, this is what guys like from the female form. 
[01:52:00]  And this is how I moved to turn on guys.  But then when it came down to it, she was a lesbian.  I'm like, there's no fucking way you are.  What's that happen?  I don't know.  Jeez.  Let's go to Paul in the, I think it's the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Paul.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  I don't know.  Maybe they have too much estrogen.  So they're really, all the time they're fighting back the gay voice.  And then when they're comfortable, they let it go.  But speaking of gay voices and being gay, I think it's time you guys play that, Mom, I'm gay. 
[01:52:30]  That's real old school.  Does it hold up?  Hey, yeah, Mom.  You have it?  I don't even know.  I got to be honest.  We'll go to break with this.  I don't know if it holds up.  I haven't heard the swallower.  I think just with the accent and everything.  It was 97, 98 when this whole coming out thing was becoming a thing.  So we decided on our radio show to have completely straight guys cold call their moms and say they were gay.  And I remember we did it all afternoon. 
[01:53:00]  But this is the one that, you know, sticks out.  Because it's just the accent and he's all a man anyway.  He's just some dopey guy trying to convince his mom he's gay.  But he says it so confidently, too.  Like, yeah, no.  I'm a dick.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  All right.  Let's play this going into break.  Thanks, Paul.  I forgot all about this call.  You got it, boy.  All right, man.  And we'll be back.  The Hi, Mom.  I'm gay.  A couple people think they were radio actors.  Radio actors.  Oh, no, no, not at all. 
[01:53:30]  Because they said the mom played, not just one guy, actually, but said the mom played her part perfectly.  Yeah.  Well, we did it all day.  That was the best one.  And I remember.  You should have heard the bad ones.  And I remember that was the phone call that had us meet with the gays.  Yes.  Because the whole thing was some kind of gay group called Bruce Mittman at AAF.  Uh-huh.  I think that's an AAF call.  Yeah, it is.  Okay.  An AAF call.  And this gay group calls Bruce and says, you know, it's very tough for. 
[01:54:00]  Difficult.  Difficult for people, young people to come out of the closet.  And you guys are mocking that.  Remember they gave us the story?  Yeah.  Of a guy that had to come out of the closet.  I never read it.  We were supposed to read it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it was, I want to say it was, I want to say it was Allison, to be honest with you.  Something about Allison.  Really?  I thought it was a dude and he had to come out to his mother and father.  I don't know.  We go into Bruce Mittman's office and then they brought in the gay group and they hated 
[01:54:30]  us.  Yeah.  We were everything that was wrong with society.  Society, yeah.  And then they handed out the dittos.  Yes.  Remember all the stuff they wanted us to read?  We had to do homework when we got home.  And then it got to a point, like Bruce allowed them their moment to a point.  Because then the guys are like, all right.  And then they handed out the book, whatever it was called.  Yeah.  And they said, we want you to read this and then we'll come back like next week so we 
[01:55:00]  can discuss this.  And that's when Bruce finally said, no, no, no, no.  I think my boys, you know, understand.  Yeah.  He kind of jumped in at that point.  They get it.  Said, yeah.  Well, they're not going to be reading your book and having a book report.  Yeah.  We want you to, yeah, write something or meet again with them and talk about what we read.  No.  And then what did Bruce say as soon as they left?  Well, that ought to hold the little faggolus for a while. 
[01:55:30]  Faggolus.  He actually said that.  You know that I got a, I got an email from him a while ago now.  Yeah.  Begging us not to tell these old stories.  Fuck that.  He says it's hurting current business.  Uh, boys, you shouldn't tell those stories.  Uh, boys.  Come on.  It was fucking ages ago.  And then, um, and then this is Taylor.  We were just talking about.  Wow.  She's buxom.  She's ridiculous.  She came in for the best booby contest, I believe. 
[01:56:00]  Nice hangers.  And, uh, that's the one that, um, when I went down to Dallas a few times to see, uh,  Jimmy, and she was from Dallas and she, uh, she came out and I, I just did not believe  that she was a lesbian.  I'm like, there's no fucking way you're a lesbian.  Like lesbian to the point where she won't even fucking have straight sex for fun?  Nope.  Nope.  I'd like to believe that, uh, hotter lesbian girls are willing to fucking jump on a dick  every so often. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Are you?  Just for the fun of it.  What?  Would you jump on a dick just for the fun of it?  I'm not a girl.  Oh.  Girls kiss each other and fucking shit like that.  Like girls, uh, there's a, we have more of a gray area with girls' sexuality.  Their gray area is a lot wider than the guy's gray area.  Guys, uh, it's very stark.  Girls work on a gradient of sexuality.  We are definitely a, uh, the guy's gray area ends with, uh, a hug.  And that's if something tragic happens where someone really needs.  But with women, the gray area is like feeling each other off, making out a little bit in 
[01:57:00]  a bar.  I got new implants.  Feel my tits.  Oh, these are nice.  Yeah.  They're fucking kissing each other.  Finger popping each other in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  It's a gray area.  The gray area is a lot wider.  Because then you ask him like, nah, I'm not a lesbian.  No, I'm straight.  I love guys.  Why would you think that?  That's stupid.  Well, maybe because your face was buried in your friend's lap.  Right.  You're licking her clitoris.  Right.  Yeah, but that's just, we're friends. 
[01:57:30]  Imagine if Roland came in giggling like that him and Travis made out at the bar and laughed  and I'm like, ah, you two are crazy.  That's okay.  Imagine.  Because that's what guys do.  It doesn't mean they're gay.  Right.  You know, we like to do that.  Right.  Or just like, you know, I don't know.  They have no qualms about touching each other anywhere, those girls.  Right.  But that.  They love it.  That girl from Dallas, I was like, there's no way you're a lesbian.  It amazed me.  What a waste.  Well, and at the time, I certainly had a little attraction to her, obviously. 
[01:58:00]  I wouldn't doubt it.  I think I made it perfectly clear.  You were single and ready to mingle?  I was single, too.  And she just wouldn't laugh at me.  She'd be like, no, no interest whatsoever in guys.  Those tits without a fucking cock between them is a waste.  Should be a big, fat kick between those.  Yeah.  What's this glory hole in the Doritos commercial that everyone's tweeting me about?  Glory hole?  This guy in Jersey said Fox 29 just ran a news piece for a Doritos commercial involving a glory hole. 
[01:58:30]  And I read a few tweets about that last night.  Someone feeding someone through a glory hole.  Some kind of glory hole in a Doritos spot?  Or maybe you suck a dick to get the taste of Doritos out of your mouth.  Make your breath better.  I enjoy a good Dorito.  I do, too, with the breath.  Zoo breath.  Somebody said he gives you a zoo breath.  I never forgot that.  Zoo breath?  That's kind of funny.  Yeah.  Because it is kind of a wet grass.  Is this it?  I wonder what the news story's about. 
[01:59:00]  This is how Doritos always does the you can make your own Doritos commercial, and we'll put one of your commercials on the Super Bowl.  Sure.  So somebody in Australia did this one.  I know what this is going to be.  Oh, so this is not going to be on the Super Bowl, and it's probably not even a real Doritos commercial.  Well, so far it's in the lead, I guess.  Oh, it's in the lead.  Contest.  All right, let's see.  Let me see where they're going, where they're going here.  Billy, use the cleaner.  Touchdown.  That's a hole where you put your finger in together. 
[01:59:30]  That's a very funny...  Oh, my God!  That is great.  That was a good one, man.  That's a good thing.  What the fuck?  You can't have that on TV.  Why not?  Now we've got to explain it.  I love Doritos.  That's genius.  That is good.  They're kind of like construction workers, and they're eating Doritos, and he's got the 
[02:00:00]  Dorito shit on his finger, so he puts it in this apparatus, and it cleans his finger,  and he doesn't know why...  But only Doritos.  Only Doritos.  Yeah.  So then they show the other side of the wall, and it's this just bald guy at a desk.  At a desk, like he's at an office.  And then all of a sudden, the finger pops through, and he fucking goes and sucks the finger.  He licks it.  Yeah, he fucking sucks it off the guy's finger.  To clean off his Dorito finger.  He does it a little sexually, though.  He's like, oh, shit.  That is fucking awesome.  Good.  Every fucking...  You think they would air that? 
[02:00:30]  It's always the international things that are...  Why not?  It's just sucking Doritos off the fingers.  It is.  It's silly.  Yeah.  I think they could air that.  Sure they could.  I mean...  And then kind of...  Hey, if you find anything sexual in that, come on.  It's silly.  They got a home run there, then, if they fucking show that.  The second part of the commercial, though, where the guy's got his dick in a Doritos bag.  Right.  Well, yeah.  That's not part of the commercial.  It is, Chip.  And then he shoves it through the wall, and the guy sucks it off.  Wow.  That's great. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, Jimmy's got the tied tie, so he can just...  He doesn't know how to tie a tie.  He doesn't know how to tie a tie.  That's today's thing.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Eric did my tie, and I'm trying to just put on a little bit and make sure it's the right length.  Oh, no.  It's not going to be right.  It's not going to be right.  I can tell it already.  The small part's going to come out further than the...  Pull it up to your neck.  Watch what happens.  No, I don't want to pull it all the way up.  But you have to, because it's too short.  I'm telling you, look how short that is.  That's not going to work.  Pull it all the way up and then tie it to a rafter.  I told him I didn't want it to be too... 
[02:01:30]  No, that's...  It's got to be below your belly button.  Oh, boy.  He fucked that up.  Oh, no.  Oh, E-Rock.  That's too high.  You need another inch.  I'm being serious.  It's a little fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the occasion?  The Boomer Esiason roast.  And if you tuck it even more, then the thin part's going to be longer than the thick part of the tie.  Maybe E-Rock can redo this.  You don't want to show up at a roast with a short tie.  You get a little ribbon.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you've still got to pull it up another inch, probably. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  That's not going to work.  To make it snug around that neck of yours.  Tying a tie is a pain in the ass.  Every time I do it, I'm like, I'm amazed it worked.  Can you do it?  Just like, ah.  I can't tie a tie.  I can't tie a tie on somebody else.  And my fucking manager does it.  Will he give you a smile?  My manager will tie my tie when I do Leno.  And he always ties a really fat tie top.  Oh, a big knot, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just a little bit straight on the top.  You know, speaking of the Super Bowl, I did not know this until this moment. 
[02:02:30]  Former FCC chairman finally admits he wasn't really outraged by the Janet Jackson nipple  gate thing.  Yeah.  Asshole.  Michael Copps.  It was Michael?  The name's in the article.  I believe it was Michael Copps.  He wasn't outraged.  What the fuck?  What a cocksucker.  Are you serious?  Why such a big to-do?  What a fucking cocksucker this guy is.  ESPN the Magazine looked back for the 10-year anniversary.  That's 10 years.  Holy shit.  It feels like about 10 years.  No, it feels like five. 
[02:03:00]  10 years.  Wow.  That was 10 years?  10 years ago, I had a Super Bowl party at my house.  Jesus.  And my ex walked in from another party because we weren't hanging anymore.  And fucking everyone went home immediately because of her horrendous attitude that she  brought through the front door.  She reened it.  It was my family.  And they all knew it was time to fucking go home.  Wow.  That was 10 years.  You know what?  Not a bad thin tie.  Oh, you got it, E-Rock? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  E-Rock's used to a different neck length.  Oh, maybe that.  I knew there'd be something there.  Sam had a comment about your tie.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I have a choice.  I'll tell you, E-Rock is the go-to fucking tie guy in this party.  Ah, look at that.  Go-to tie guy?  Riveting.  I couldn't even tell you the last time I wore a tie, so when am I ever going to use  him for the go-to tie guy?  It's important to have one, though.  I got to wear one, too.  I have to wear ties, so when are we going to fucking use him for the tie thing?  He did save me a sea salt. 
[02:04:00]  Shred pop.  Nice.  And Dr. Ian Smith.  Somebody's in brown-nose mode.  Oh, brown-nose!  Why only three bags?  Because I thought you said you were going to take some home.  You're not going to carry all the rest of that home, are you?  Yeah.  Give me a fucking shopping bag.  It's been two days, and I haven't, so I just put him in the office.  Wait, but this is the last sea salt, right?  I think he just called you a piece of shit.  He did.  I'm only into the sea salt.  Well, I'm not a honey barbecue guy. 
[02:04:30]  He's like, well, you didn't take a home yet?  I've never been a honey barbecue guy.  Bick.  You want a honey barbecue?  Nah.  You want a kettle?  Nah.  Oh, you don't want to crazy glue your teeth together again?  Well, that's true, too.  Once I open up that ice cream sandwich and fucking teeth came popping out of my face, I'd  like crazy glue them in.  Good thing they're just dentures.  No, they're temporary until my veneers come in, and that will be Tuesday.  I love how they created a new name for falsies.  It's fun, isn't it? 
[02:05:00]  What?  It just makes it so nice.  Veneers.  It's like how they used to call them hair plugs.  Right.  No.  But in the end, they're just chiclets.  They are.  No.  They're just big, big, over-the-top chiclets.  These are artistically made veneers that go on the front of reshaped natural teeth.  She reshapes them, and then you take the mold, and now I'm waiting for the lab to make up  the veneers, and then Tuesday, this Tuesday, I will go in, they will adhere them to the  front of the reshaped teeth, and it will look astounding. 
[02:05:30]  Slap those chiclets on.  No!  You should work on Madison Avenue.  You know how to describe shit.  I love it.  You know how to describe shit really well.  Oh, my God.  These are not shit.  They are wonderful choppers.  You made horse teeth sound amazing.  Right.  There are now three separate cracked pieces of these that I've glued back on with crazy  glue.  How much more time you got?  Tuesday.  Next Tuesday?  I gotta get through this weekend.  I gotta get through the Super Bowl party. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, my God.  But at that point...  I hope they fucking come out like dandruff.  At that point, you should just let them fall out.  Fuck it.  No!  Because they're very discolored and ground down, and they actually, without any covering  on them, there's a pain.  There's a tinge.  Are the nerves all open?  It's not crazy pain, but it's this quick tinge that is not fucking pleasant.  And, no, the nerves aren't exposed, but they shave it down a little bit to the point where 
[02:06:30]  it's a lot thinner, so you're a lot more sensitive to pressure or temperature.  Can I ask you, uh, that's why I don't get my teeth whitened?  Uh-huh.  We used to have that client.  Yeah, that bright smile thing.  And the ping, I call it a ping of pain that I got for, I think it was about two days.  Yeah, I remember that.  All of a sudden, it's a pain that you're like, if this was a second of pain, you probably  would jump out a window.  Yeah.  It's not good.  It only happened for, I can't even tell, like a, not even a split, it was so quick. 
[02:07:00]  It's very sporadic, too.  It wasn't, it just would come unexpectedly.  But it would make you just go, oh, like that really quickly, and then it would go away  right when it was going to be unbearable.  But that's why I don't get my teeth whitened.  Have they fixed that shit yet?  I don't know.  I got them done.  I get them done every six months or so, and you feel-  And do you still feel that?  Lightly, but it's worth it, because I know what it is.  It's just the pores of the teeth.  It's nothing bad.  It doesn't-  I don't care if it's, I mean, I care that it hurts.  One of the greatest depictions of tooth pain was on Ren and Stimpy, and I think it was 
[02:07:30]  Ren had a bad tooth, and it was the nerve beaver, and it was this bloody nerve that was  hanging out, and this little beaver would grab it and go, and just start, like, hacking  at it.  I remember that.  Yeah, is that it?  Let me see this.  It's a very good memory.  I forgot about this thing.  Nerve beaver.  I can't see it.  It sucks.  That's all right.  Oh, it does? 
[02:08:00]  That's the rotten tooth.  Right.  Is that it?  They're all flies.  Right.  The flies leave.  All his teeth are pulled out, and there's just nerves hanging down, and a stench coming  out of his mouth.  This is on Nickelodeon.  I know.  This is great.  When it first came out, there was nothing fucking better.  I don't think, uh, how much is left?  How much time?  I didn't see the nerve beaver.  What the fuck?  That was it.  Show me the nerve beaver. 
[02:08:30]  He'll find that.  Damn it.  So, it's ten years since Janet Jackson, the wardrobe malfunctioned.  The ESPN magazine looked back at it, talking to different people.  The best quotes came from Michael Powell.  Powell.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Michael Powell.  There you go.  Right.  Michael Powell.  Was Michael Cops was another one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought so.  Michael Powell.  Michael Powell.  Michael Powell's son.  The SEC chairman at the time, the group that policed decency on television and had to  deal with everyone thinking of the children because of a televised nipple, he watched a  boob at his house and said to his friend, my day is going to suck tomorrow. 
[02:09:00]  Though at the time, Powell called it a classless, crass, and deplorable stunt.  Ten years later, Powell admits it wasn't as big of a deal as everyone made it out to be.  But he was front and center saying it was-  Yeah, you fucking fake bag of shit.  Why didn't he say that at the time?  He could have helped us move all this shit along faster.  I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put  my best version of outrage on that that I could put on.  Why?  He says. 
[02:09:30]  That's why I hate them all.  I hate all these guys.  Fucking politicians in general.  Shrugging his shoulders and rolling his eyes.  Part of it was surreal, right?  Look, I think it was dumb to happen and they knew the rules and we're flirting with them  and my job is to enforce the rules.  But you know, really, this is what we're going to do.  Oh, he goes, but really, this is what we're going to do?  Why not just say, look, it happened.  What's with the outrage?  He felt they tested his power, so he had to show his power.  What a scumbag. 
[02:10:00]  He is a scumbag.  If he really didn't think it was a big deal.  And, you know, we've talked about Nipplegate a million fucking times over the years.  And what made that so much more worse was the fact that the news showed it over and over  again and they were allowed to.  And they froze it.  They froze it.  And not all of them were, you know, fucking cubing it out or whatever.  No.  And all they would cube out was the middle part of the nipple ring thing she had on where  the actual nipple was poking through.  But not all stations.  Some just let it fly because, you know, they felt they were in a safe harbor because now 
[02:10:30]  it's news.  Uh-huh.  They made it way the fuck worse than the one time it happened quickly on the actual Super  Bowl.  The still pictures.  And it was so fleeting on the actual broadcast.  Like I said, I had a family over that day.  And I remember we all went, what was that?  But we weren't sure.  We didn't see it.  But we weren't sure.  Yeah.  That's the absolute truth.  Until the next day when they said, well, this is what it was.  Right.  It was like, holy fuck.  What did you see?  I just went back on the DVR.  They said at that time it was the most rewound. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, there was those DVRs.  And I remember just going back a few seconds.  I don't think.  Wow.  I must have a cheap cable.  What a cheapskate.  Because I remember they said that nothing had been DVR'd that much.  Like I had gone backwards.  I don't remember rewinding that.  T-Vo.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't have T-Vo.  It was T-Vo.  I had the T-Vo.  You had to plug your phone line into it.  Right.  Your telephone had to plug into it so that they could update it and things like that.  They would send you.  That's only 10 years ago.  Phone.  That's only 10 years ago. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I just, but my point, the initial reaction, we had a lot of, my nephews and nieces were  really young at the time.  And we all didn't know what the fuck we saw.  Yeah.  And none of us cared that the kids even saw it.  We were like, whatever.  It's a stupid nipple.  Who cares?  Fucking amazing.  They suck on a nipple for the first, what, year and a half of their lives.  Yeah.  Give the fuck.  I love how, off topic, the technology thing just advancing like that, like from a phone  line going into a T-Vo.  And I remember T-Vo being kind of a pain in the ass when it first came out like that. 
[02:12:00]  And then last night, I'm just watching TV and then I'm like, Xbox, go to Netflix.  And then there's Netflix.  And then you get done with that.  Xbox, watch TV.  And then that, you're just talking to your fucking shit.  It's changing between the gaming system, the fucking cable box, anything else you need,  different apps.  You get Netflix or Hulu, Amazon, whatever I feel like watching at the time, without picking 
[02:12:30]  up a remote.  Not doing anything.  It's fucking astounding.  And we'll play this audio back a few years ago.  And then people will be like, what?  And we'll sound really stupid.  That's crazy.  But we're not visionaries to understand what will be next.  No.  Unless you're Jim Norton.  What will make this look completely archaic?  Not using any type of vocal connection.  Just thinking things.  Just thinking it would be amazing.  Yeah, because if we're talking it, yeah, that would basically be the next step, I guess.  Everybody thought like voice recognition was going to be a tough thing for these things. 
[02:13:00]  Like, well, you know, but it doesn't, you don't even need the voice recognition anymore.  Anyone could come in and just say, yeah, Xbox, play Call of Duty or whatever.  And it shows up.  The face recognition, you walk in the room, the Xbox knows that I'm in the room.  And it says, hello.  And then my username.  Shithead.  G. Gordon Titty is my name.  And we worry about the NSA why?  That's my gaming name.  And we worry about the NSA why?  It's already happening. 
[02:13:30]  It's all around us.  The thing that does get me a little shaken is that a camera is pointing at me.  The entire time I'm in my living room.  And it's plugged in to the web.  Now, there are various safeguards that are supposed to be there as far as passwords go and whatnot.  But there's a camera and there's a cable going out to the world.  That's all you need to get compromised. 
[02:14:00]  You know, all they're seeing is me sitting there, you know.  Come here.  Oh, Beavis.  Ooh.  But who cares?  Put a fucking, when you're not watching TV, put a fucking towel over it like it's a bird.  Cover it.  A bird.  I don't know.  Because, like, even if I'm not watching TV and I come in the room, it knows that it's me.  Like, it signs me in under who I am so I could then, you know, play Call of Duty or something.  I don't know.  It is something that should definitely, you should be leery of it if you're doing something bad, maybe. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe, you know, you don't want to have your Xbox gaming system in the same room where you're growing weed.  Right.  You've got a lot of lights and you're weed fucking, or you're cutting up fucking coke.  You've got to be a little smart about it.  Yeah, one of your guys is maybe playing fucking Battlefield or something.  Holla.  Yeah.  Or if you're jerking off some porno you're watching on the Xbox or whatever.  Just make jerk off tapes.  If somebody wants to fucking watch me jacking my meat. 
[02:15:00]  They can just turn this show on from 6.30 to 10.30.  You had some complete lack of satisfaction.  Jesus.  That is scary though, man.  The cameras.  It is, dude.  Is it hackable?  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Someone's going to figure that shit out.  Everything's hackable.  Of course.  And it's fucking there.  It's right there in my fucking living room.  They've figured out how to put cameras in everyone's house and connect it to the fucking internet. 
[02:15:30]  1984.  It's crazy.  Read 1984.  And again, it's not under the guise that, hey, we're going to be watching you.  It's under the guise of, look how convenient and fun this is.  Of course.  But what's the barrier between that and the internet?  There has to be a barrier.  IP address.  A password to log into.  Not to log into your network.  You know, I don't know.  But to tell you the truth, it could be done.  But I mean, you got security cameras all over your house that you check from your phone right here. 
[02:16:00]  That's another thing.  Right.  I mean, how hard could that be for someone to tap into that shit?  You're absolutely right.  Baby monitors.  That's another thing.  People just put cameras in there.  I look at my baby and throw a baby monitor.  I'm like, who else can see this shit?  Who else can see this?  You're right.  It's just reached a point where we're so comfortable with cameras in our houses that just go out onto the internet.  And you assume it's secure, but I mean, there could be somebody peering in on you.  Right. 
[02:16:30]  It's amazing.  Why don't we do a couple other things here?  Because I think we want to also do the 600-pound woman thing.  Oh, that fucking piece of shit.  So we're going to have to clear the field for that because we're going to need a good 40 minutes for that.  TLC had a show after the 90-day fiancée where it was half a Hulk face girl.  Right.  She was 17 years old, half a Hulk face.  Right.  And it was really sad.  Poor girl going to school and just getting fucking bullied like crazy from these people.  And they were showing the school.  It's like, wow, this school's getting a bad rap here because they were just showing the name of the school. 
[02:17:00]  And she's talking about how horrible the kids are.  The kids are brutal.  And then I guess she went online at some point and made a video where, you know,  she's got the little index cards with things written on it about what a normal person she is.  Did she put her?  She did all that with the music behind it.  Did she put half her face behind the refrigerator?  No.  Did you ever do that trick when you were growing up?  No.  And what, double?  Yeah, then you get the good side twice.  Yeah.  No, she didn't do that.  And then if you see it from an angle, you get to see, you know. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  No.  She talked about how bullied she was.  And then I guess the next day she woke up and there was a fuckload of messages and stuff of support.  Oh, good.  Good.  And then she had an operation at the end where they kind of fucking propped her face up a little bit.  So now instead of being a one, she's a two?  I don't even know.  That's not even a number.  There's not even a number.  It's beyond a number at that point.  But she seemed nice enough.  On Shark Tank, they showed how people could tap into webcams.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable? 
[02:18:00]  I'm definitely looking through people's webcams and fucking up their lives.  Yeah, see, I don't want it to recognize when I walk in.  Once it's on, it's on.  Yeah.  But I don't need it to recognize when I walk in.  I'll just fucking turn off.  Just put the Groucho Marx glasses on every time you're right.  So here's what it is.  When it recognizes you, and then you say Xbox Go Home, it goes to the home screen, and it's customized to you.  It's got all of your apps and everything.  So then if somebody else walks in that it identifies, and you say Xbox Go Home, it will be their personalized thing with all their apps on it. 
[02:18:30]  Would you get a record of everyone that walked in the room?  Well, you have to be kind of – it has to know you.  You have to have a profile on that Xbox.  It won't just say, like, hey, look, it's Opie.  I got you.  But let's say I'm on there and a whole bunch of your other –  Oh, yeah, there could be, like, six people in the fucking room.  It'll know each person individually.  But then could you go back and go, oh, these are all the people that used my Xbox today?  Yep.  Wow.  Yeah, definitely.  I like that.  There is some fucking weird, scary thing, though. 
[02:19:00]  Why don't we talk about a couple other things really fast?  This Brooklyn school thing is pissing me off.  Brooklyn school cutting gifted program to boost diversity.  Ah, diversity, dishmarsity.  I hate diversity.  But why do people that are smarter than others have to suffer for this shit?  Because it's – we have to bring everybody up.  A popular gifted program will get the axe after Ditmas Park School officials chose diversity over exclusivity. 
[02:19:30]  Citing a lack of diversity, PS139 principal Mary McDonald informed parents in a letter that the students of an academic rigor and two other in-house programs would no longer accept applications for incoming kindergartners.  Our kindergarten classes will be hetero – oh, boy.  Hetero-genius?  A new word.  A new fucking PC word.  Yeah, hetero-geniusly grouped to reflect the diversity of our student body and the community we live in.  Yeah.  McDonald told parents in letters posted on the photo-sharing site, Flicka, where the two-thirds of the school's roughly 1,000 students are black or Hispanic, while Asian-American and white students made up 28% according to education department records. 
[02:20:00]  So there's too many, what, white kids and Asian kids?  Yes, there are in the gifted program.  In the gifted program.  Of course there are.  So now they all get penalized for being smarter than everyone else, right?  Yes, right, right, because you have to throw in people that –  God, what are we doing?  Well, at the same time, there's a black student union and, of course, Minnesota and a college where they're asking that racial – people thought it was crazy when racial descriptions not be used in suspect descriptions. 
[02:20:30]  Of course.  The black students' union –  Of course.  – doesn't want racial makeup used in a suspect description.  At least one parent described a small gifted program called SOAR, S-O-A-R, as overwhelmingly Caucasian.  Yeah.  All right.  Is there a criteria to get in besides race?  Is that – do they say you can only be white or is there an academic criteria that might be needed? 
[02:21:00]  There's an academic criteria.  Oh, see?  It's not just race?  It doesn't say whites only on the door?  Huh, then I wonder why.  Smart whites only.  It's both.  Okay.  Yeah.  I got you.  Did you hear what happened with Howard University?  Apparently, they were welcoming back the students through some local ads and billboards and whatnot, and it said, welcome back students of Howard University, which is predominantly black school.  Right.  And it showed a white girl as a student, smiling, and, you know, it's some fucking pizza place or something, welcoming the students back. 
[02:21:30]  There was outrage by the student body saying that this is not representative of Howard University, having a white – meanwhile, there are a couple of white people that go there.  It is overwhelmingly black.  Sure.  But why, then, can't you show – and why is there outrage because – why?  Because it's a small, small portion of Howard University?  In that case, only one in ten television commercials should have black people in it.  If you want to just base it on that, why is Cheerios being represented by an interracial couple with a child when that probably doesn't amount to .0 something of the actual population of the country? 
[02:22:00]  Let's argue that.  Because white people are fucking fakes and have zero balls to say this stuff.  But they sure get into those smart schools with the Asians.  But you know what I'm saying, though?  That's all it is.  Uh-huh.  It's people not just going, shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Very frustrating. 
[02:22:30]  I hear you.  Let me say hi to Josh in North Carolina.  Josh.  I bet he's going to Josh us.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Chip wants it.  I know.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hi.  Hey, when my son was in elementary school, there were about 20 kids that were white and were sort of intelligent.  And every year, they would spread them out.  So, like, in first grade, they'd have three or four of them in each of the classes.  And it went that way through every year of elementary school.  To raise the GPA?  Oh, wait.  Colin. 
[02:23:00]  Let's see Colin Quinn on Fox.  Oh, hold on a minute, brother.  Boulevard?  You're over it, right?  I was over it the minute I heard it.  What is this, Disney?  What are we in Orlando?  Hey, let's change the name to Mickey Mouse Bulldog.  It's Broadway.  Broadway.  Don't you feel the energy?  The toboggan ride?  Don't you feel my energy?  He's angry.  He's an angry man.  What about the trophy?  Did you get out of the toboggan ride?  I wanted to go on the toboggan.  He went on the toboggan.  You did?  I got all dressed up in fancy equipment.  It was kind of cool.  Was it fun?  You know what?  It was okay. 
[02:23:30]  It was not the most spectacular thing that ever happened to me.  But I understand your lack of enthusiasm.  I understand.  No.  This morning, I was like, I want to go to the toboggan.  They go, well, maybe we'd set up.  But then I realized from being in the business this long, I was like, can you imagine the  delays, the phone calls to try to set up one stupid toboggan?  I said, forget it.  I know.  You're right about that.  But you know, you can go right up there and see the trophy.  And then we're going to do some kicking field goals in just a few minutes.  Oh, you are?  Would you like to do that with us?  No.  He's unimpressed. 
[02:24:00]  No, I like the idea of kicking field goals.  It could be fun.  But it just sounds like a hassle.  It's going to be another hour.  It's not going to be a hassle.  What's wrong with you?  Don't you have the Super Bowl?  No, I don't.  Are you going to the game on Sunday?  No, I didn't even get tickets.  The last time I heard you this, man, you know what gets him?  Street fairs.  That's right.  You don't like street fairs either.  I love street fairs.  Oh, come on.  You're going on and on about street fairs.  You know, socks.  Who needs socks on a Sunday afternoon?  It's a blocky, right?  This is your fit.  Socks and so blocky.  Where can he get socks and so blocky right next door to each other?  So, all right. 
[02:24:30]  So he's not into the Super Bowl.  Tell us about your latest project.  Oh, I'm doing the Writers Guild Awards Saturday night.  I'm hosting.  Oh.  Saturday night.  Right at the Edison Hotel, right on the corner.  Oh, that'd be fun.  Yeah.  So who's going to be there?  Who's going to be there?  Yeah.  You know what?  Not that.  I mean, David Simon, the guy from The Wire, you know.  All right.  Some luminaries.  Yeah.  Carry on.  You know what happened?  He doesn't even know who's going to be there.  No, he doesn't.  You know what happened in the Edison lobby?  What? 
[02:25:00]  What happened?  Luca Brasi got whacked in The Godfather.  What do you mean?  In the Edison Hotel.  In the lobby.  Greg lives on hit movies.  You hear the band.  The band.  This is beautiful.  This is Super Bowl Boulevard.  Oh, no.  Don't.  But that was in the movie.  It was in the movie.  But it's when you walk in, you'll recognize it.  You'll recognize it.  Sorry.  Good luck with that.  By the way, tell us about Unconstitutional.  I saw it in person here in New York.  Incredible show.  Can people still see it?  Not here, I guess.  Well, yes.  On the road.  I knew it was going to be a 40-piece band when I'm trying to promote my game.  I understand.  We can hear you perfectly. 
[02:25:30]  You don't have to yet.  Studio can't hear.  The people at home.  I'm worried about the people at home.  Seriously, tell the band to knock it off.  Can you tell the band to knock it off?  Let's tell the band to knock it off.  Are you happy about that, Colin Quinn?  What?  He's telling these young, nice, dark green go-getters who were so happy.  It was so funny.  I know.  They were gripping it.  I was saying, if that was me, I'd be like, God.  I'm going to get you a tuba.  I'll be right back.  Seriously.  I'm going to stop him.  I'm going to stop him.  No, we like it.  We like it.  I can't concentrate.  Why?  It has a nice flavor.  It has a live flavor. 
[02:26:00]  I know.  No, he'll be right back.  Colin, you and I will talk about it.  His instincts are wrong.  His instincts are wrong.  Don't I know?  Colin, tell us about the show.  Do you change it?  Do you update it?  Yes, I change it.  I change it all the time.  Because I've seen you live, and I love the fact that you're always kind of integrating  things that are happening in the news right now.  Right, right.  That's what I do.  The show, too.  So what are you talking about these days?  Well, the whole Duck Dynasty thing was in there.  Just everything that goes on. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, really?  Which way did you go on the Duck Dynasty thing?  I realize there's old news.  Yeah.  Well, just over the fact that people, this country's freedom of speech, but everybody's  like, oh, you have to stop this.  Everybody should be like, oh, look at the crazy hillbilly.  Right.  But everyone's like, no, he has to be stopped so he can explain that that's wrong or it'll  catch on.  It's a very Puritan country lately, I've noticed.  I hear you.  What are you going to be doing for Super Bowl Sunday?  Are you going to watch it at home?  I'm watching it.  I'll probably be at a friend's house.  Maybe if you've heard of it.  I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  Jerry Seinfeld.  All right.  You've got Jerry Seinfeld's house?  Look.  They have something to say to you.  Hi, guys.  Hi, there.  Hi, there.  Apologize to Colin.  Quit interrupting.  Sorry, Colin.  Can you play a little something for Colin?  The only guy didn't apologize.  Just say you're sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay, now that you're here, can you do a tuba solo?  Honestly, my vows are frozen right now.  I can't play.  The instruments are frozen.  They're moving.  Can you play something?  That sounds like a problem.  Yes. 
[02:27:30]  Sorry.  Their fucking instruments froze.  He's ready.  The tuba's not.  And they think people are going to go out to that dummy.  It's ridiculous.  Great.  You're like ripped tail.  You're playing.  Super Bowl.  Bulletin.  This is live TV.  Things happen like this.  It's part of the charge.  Is this the news, by the way?  The important thing is going to Rutgers.  Is this the news?  No.  They don't go to Rutgers.  All right.  What happened?  No.  The instruments are out of commission.  All right, gentlemen.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  All right.  That segment bombed.  Bravo.  Colin Quinn.  Local Fox.  Mr. Negative about Fox. 
[02:28:00]  Why don't you smile?  What a hater.  He really is a hater, isn't he?  Of anything fun.  Oh, Carl.  And somebody pointed out that he's on TV dressed like a high school football coach from New Jersey.  What a fucking idiot.  How about you put on a suit?  Hosting the Writing Guild Awards.  Who's going to be there?  Meh.  People with pens.  Yeah.  Oh, Carl.  He's terrible at plugging.  Terrible.  That whole thing with that Super Bowl Boulevard thing.  Look, there's no one there. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of a bust.  It's a cold that cannot be dealt with, is what it is.  It's 19 today in New York?  Yeah, you can't just go out there and have a great time at an outdoor festival in 19 degree weather.  You ever kick a football in cold weather?  Holy shit.  You'll break your fucking toe.  It hurts every fucking bone in your body.  No one's got the proper gear on?  Yeah.  Who's going to that?  It's a bust, I think.  Christ.  A total bust.  All right.  We're going to take a break. 
[02:29:00]  I think people are on hold.  Oh.  They can talk about the Xbox thing and how you can hack in.  I bet there'll be people that have a thing that they'll say, and then other people will  call and say that's bullshit.  Supposedly there's websites dedicated to it.  Oh, yeah?  And there's trolling videos and all sorts of shit.  Are there videos of Xbox?  Yeah.  That would be cool.  Some of you people stay in the line, or if you're hung up, call us back.  And then we got clips, finally, of the 600-pound broad named Penny that you brought  to our show a little while ago.  Penny?  We finally got the episode and got the key clips. 
[02:29:30]  Bitch.  So we'll play that as well.  Welcome to another Viscous Entertainment production of Porno for the Blind.  Narrated by sex god Lyle Chikerson.  This is Farrah, Backdoor Teen Mom.  She's sucking his pekka.  Yeah.  Now she's still sucking his pekka. 
[02:30:00]  Now she's back.  She stopped, and now she's sucking his pekka again.  She's holding his pekka.  Now she's looking at his pekka.  Now she's back up.  He's got his pekka in her.  He's playing with a clit with his pekka inside of her.  He's got his hand on her leg and his other hand on her clit, and he's put his big pekka inside  of her.  She's moaning because she loves his pekka.  She's moaning because she loves his pekka.  She's got her head on a pillow while he slams her cooter with his pekka. 
[02:30:30]  That's a cool picture right there.  You can see her butthole and his pekka slamming in and out real fast.  Now it's out, now it's in, now it's out, now it's in.  Now it's out, now it's in.  He's holding her butt cheeks while he puts his pekka into her really hard and fast.  Now he's moving her hair because it's on her shoulder, and he's holding her hips, and  he's putting his pekka in her pussy really hard.  He's giving it to her good. 
[02:31:00]  That's the way I fuck.  Why the fuck did we use that guy's voice?  Thanks for listening, and be on the lookout for more Porno for the Blind releases from  Viscous Entertainment.  They're rich, and they pee, but they're done.  Welcome back to the O.P. Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  Geez, enough.  Let's go.  All right. 
[02:31:30]  I don't pee that much anymore.  What's there?  What's that?  No one's there at that stupid Super Bowl thing.  Times Square.  They keep showing it on the news like a big thing.  Yeah, local Fox 5, and they do well locally with Rosanna Scotto.  Ah.  And, yeah, no one's there.  No one's there.  They're broadcasting live.  They're having a good time, but I don't see any viewers whatsoever for their show.  No.  So, oh, well.  Super Bowl's ramping up. 
[02:32:00]  It's going to be really exciting.  Oh, yeah.  Just amazing.  It's going to be a great game.  The excitement in the air around here is just ridiculous.  It really is.  It's just overwhelming.  I gather if the Jets or Giants were in it, this would be, like, a big thing.  People would, like, be into it more.  But it's like, no one really seems to give a shit that the Super Bowl is here.  I mean, they're trying to hype it.  All the channels, the news, everyone's trying to hype it.  But the people, like, we don't care.  It's falling short.  No one really gives a shit. 
[02:32:30]  The locals don't.  They care about Super Bowl just like anyone else in another city that doesn't have their team in it.  But you would think that it would bring a lot of local excitement because it is here.  And that's just not happening.  But you get a place like Miami, when it's in Miami or something, it's just, like, huge.  The crowds, like, there is a big thing, like, it's a big event going on.  We knew you would stop by, you TV star, you!  I just saw you on the TV.  You were just up there. 
[02:33:00]  That's the guy.  That's the guy.  He was...  You were right on the TV.  You were just on the TV.  Rupert Pupka.  You guys are in some mood.  We were just talking about Times Square and Super Bowl Alley, whatever the fuck they're.  Boulevard.  Boulevard, whatever the fuck.  No one gives a fuck.  It's pathetic.  It's 19 degrees.  Who wants to fucking stroll down the boulevard?  When they have all that set up in a warm city, there's so many people, you can't even move.  Miami Super Bowls, it's huge.  But it's just corny.  It's Broadway, New York.  They're calling it Super Bowl Boulevard. 
[02:33:30]  It's corny.  I think it's fun, and it just brings the spirit of the Super Bowl to the city.  Oh, boy.  I like it a lot.  Go out there, take your field goal.  You don't like Super Bowl Boulevard?  Go make a touchdown.  Did a good job there on the TV.  Oh, yeah.  It's like you've done that before.  Yeah.  And then their little tuba bit didn't work.  No, that was crazy.  The tubas were literally frozen.  They were frozen.  No one's going to go out and have a great outdoor fucking Super Bowl Boulevard moment when the instruments are literally freezing. 
[02:34:00]  Right.  Right.  Who wants to go out there?  Look, there's no one there.  There's no one there.  No one cares.  That's basic Times Square traffic.  They were hoping for a regular winter that we usually get, but we got a shitty one this year.  It's 19 degrees out.  No one wants to be outside.  That's too funny.  At 19?  I'm crying out loud.  You're not bundled up very much for a...  Well, you know what?  Jim, sit down.  We don't need to see your goddamn Puerto Rican dress pants.  I'm getting ready as we chat. 
[02:34:30]  What are you getting ready for?  Are you going to the Latin Quarter?  No, I'm not.  I'm hosting an award show, and I have no idea who's going to be there.  Fucking idiot.  But the truth is, nobody's going to be there.  Yeah.  David Simon.  I want to say Keri Russell, but I didn't want them to trash her.  I don't know what these people are going to say.  Keri Russell.  Right, right.  Greg Kelly's kind of a loose wire.  He'll say anything.  He's a bit crazy.  But he will actually say, who's that? 
[02:35:00]  Who is that?  Oh, really?  And then, yeah, so it's really, you know.  I didn't want to break the news.  That's my biggest name there.  The guy wanted me to promote.  And I saw the publicist afterwards, and you should have seen his eyes.  He was looking at me.  He's like, okay, thanks for doing that.  Oh, no.  Really?  Oh, well.  Not happy?  Well, is there not a big crowd there?  Are they selling tickets for that?  I don't know.  Oh, boy, you don't know much about this.  Yeah, you don't really.  Do you have anything written, or are they just...  Oh, I got some zingers written, believe me.  Zingers.  It's been a crazy year for writing, guys. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I got some jokes.  What is it?  The Writers Guild?  Writers Guild East.  Oh, you want to go up and go, what's next?  The Lollipop Guild?  Oh, with that.  That's a good one.  That's not even that bad.  For Chip, I mean.  Right, for Chip.  He did that in a semi-Chip voice.  It's like half Chip, half Jim.  It's like having those pants and his T-shirt, his vintage Jim, UFC, and the pants.  That's a new Jim.  Yes, it is.  New, improved Jim.  The big Boomer Esiason roast.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a roast this afternoon, huh? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  And some good lines, too.  They should be televising it on their radio show, man.  They'll probably, like, record some shit.  They should have me on there talking about fucking punching him in the head.  I'm imagining that.  I fucking socked him right in the fucking head.  You did?  Yeah, years ago.  You don't know this story?  After all these years?  No, this is great.  This is an amazing story.  This has got to be.  Wait, let me guess, first of all.  Yeah.  All right, guess.  I'm going to say it said TJ Spratz.  No.  TJ Spratz.  This goes way back. 
[02:36:30]  Fucking references.  This is a rivalry that goes way back.  This is great.  This is a fucking Long Island rivalry.  I'm talking Long Island.  We're talking East Islip.  Not even high school.  No.  Not high school.  We're talking Timber Point Elementary School.  I lived on Country Village Lane.  Fucking lit up Boomer.  And so did Boomer.  Boomer lived right around the corner from me.  This is going to be a good one.  He was always the big fucking jack guy.  Wait, how many years did you know him back then?  Before, like, your lives went separate ways. 
[02:37:00]  Probably knew him maybe a year.  Oh, okay.  Not too long.  I thought it was longer than that.  No.  But he was even Boomer back then.  Right.  Everyone called him Boomer.  He was the fucking gym teacher's pet, man.  Right.  This guy, you know.  Big blonde jock.  Yeah.  And he was kind of...  Are you the swarthy little Italian?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But he was a bully.  It's a good matchup, right?  Yeah.  He was a fucking bully in school.  Sure.  Like, he would go around the cafeteria and, like, he was the guy that would just smack the back  of someone's head.  Right.  Or he'd grab someone's head and fart in their face. 
[02:37:30]  And just, he was the bully.  He was like fucking...  He was like incognito.  Yeah.  He was a fucking bully guy.  It's like 80...  That character was in every 80s movie.  Every 80s movie.  Right, right, right.  He was the guy.  Right.  He was the guy.  And people were pretty scared of him.  How old?  How old?  How old?  We were in...  It had to be, what?  Fourth grade, maybe?  So you're talking 10, 11-ish?  15th grade, something like that.  Yeah.  11?  Yes.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Maybe.  Not even, maybe.  Okay.  And then he was called a Boomer, and his real name was Norman, but you didn't fucking call 
[02:38:00]  him Norman.  Right.  Call him Norman.  He'll fucking kick your ass.  Sure.  So he was walking down the hall in school.  Same thing was true about Norman Fell, by the way, when he was growing up.  Oh, Norman Fell didn't like...  He liked Boomer Fell.  Yeah.  Boomer.  So I saw his back was turned, and he's walking.  I thought it was a courageous moment to yell, Norman!  So I did that, and as I turned around, one of his good friends was just looking at  me, shaking his head and smiling. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  And I'm like, oh, he saw it.  Now he's going to rat me out to Boomer.  So Boomer, Boomer comes over and says, I'll see you after school.  Of course.  I'm like, oh, no.  He goes, of course.  Oh, no.  So as we're leaving Timber Point Elementary School...  Why did it always have to be after school?  I don't know.  Why couldn't it go down at that moment?  You can't go fight right in school.  Why?  Why did it always have to be after school?  Back then it did.  Now forget it.  Kids are cheating.  I don't know.  Yeah, exactly.  Back in the day, three o'clock was a dangerous time. 
[02:39:00]  They had patience back then.  They go like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Three o'clock.  It was very close to the end of the school year also.  It was very close to the end of the school year.  So we go outside and I, of course, he like takes his jacket off and shit.  I got to stop because I've heard the story a lot, but now I got other questions.  Uh-huh.  Why did you show up at three o'clock against this monster?  I didn't show up.  I left the school.  You had to leave school.  I had to leave.  You could leave like through other doors back then.  They knew where I lived. 
[02:39:30]  It was fucking like the mafia.  Get it over with.  It's the mob.  You got it.  Go ahead.  When they call for you, when they call for you, you got to go.  Fucking Donnie Brasco.  Anthony put his little watch and his fucking Joe named the fuck heart in a teeny drawer.  I can't turn the prick.  Yeah, so I walk out.  He takes his coat off and I zip mine up because I figure as much padding as I could get from  getting hit.  And I had one of those old 70s snorkel jackets. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, that's a mistake.  That was a mistake.  No peripheral.  No peripheral.  So we start.  Did the school end in the middle of February, for Christ's sake?  She said it was the end of the year.  It was cold.  It was the end of the year, but it was a little unseasonably cold, Colin.  It turned into a very, yeah, yeah, artistic, uh, I could see how I would shoot this, by  the way.  Anyway.  Yeah.  So, uh, we square off and stuff and, and I throw a punch and it lands square on his forehead.  It hit him.  I gave my right hand right to the forehead and I felt like this weird tingly feeling and 
[02:40:30]  stuff.  And I'm like, oh, that's, uh, that's not good.  Right.  Uh, of course my arm then goes down and he punches me and, and I hit the ground and  fights over very quickly.  How many times did he punch you?  Just once?  Probably once or twice.  I hit him right on the ground.  No, he didn't pummel me.  He didn't pummel me.  But, uh, so I get up and I, I go home and then the next day my arm is swollen.  I go to Dr. Fuchs, my pediatrician. 
[02:41:00]  Dr. Fuchs.  She takes an x-ray and tells me that my ulna and radius, uh, are broken.  I punched him in the head and broke my fucking arm.  Hilarious.  And that was it.  And to this day, you'd like to have dropped again, wouldn't you?  I would love to punch that meathead right in the fucking, I've, I actually, uh, we, we  went into a golf, uh, charity thing with him and stuff and we were laughing at the bar  talking about it.  But, uh, yeah, we, we remember growing at East Islip.  It was very, you know, suburban Long Island, hijinks. 
[02:41:30]  Hilarious.  Just.  Meanwhile, you are you doing that?  My cousin was getting beat up by your brother.  So.  Right.  So Joe Cumia was more like Boomer to my cousin.  That's true.  Now, your cousin, guaranteed, your cousin has fantasies of punching my brother in the face.  I'm sure he does.  Because that's, you know, occasionally, now I got to drive home on the expressway every  day and look at a giant billboard of Boomer pointing at the car.  I swear.  It's a, it's a billboard.  He's pointing at you. 
[02:42:00]  Boomer and Carton are on this giant billboard.  That's just for you.  Flashback.  You're looking out of the street.  Right.  And Boomer, every day, I got to look at him pointing at me and he's going, ha ha.  Ha ha.  He fucking broke your arm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Jimmy, you going to bring that up in the show?  You know, that always works well when you do something inside.  Right.  Inside joke at a roast.  Like, huh?  What?  And then you stumble and go, ha, he knows what I'm talking about.  Ha ha ha.  No, I'm going to talk like the guy, Tommy from Raging Bull. 
[02:42:30]  He has a head of rock.  Ha ha ha.  And then when the crowd's quiet, you go, look at him taking me serious.  Yeah.  Drink up, Boomer.  It's ginger ale.  Look great.  New soup.  Ha ha ha.  What a great performance that was.  Oh.  Carl, you're going to be here next week?  More-headed fake.  What's that?  You're going to be here next week for the super show.  Oh, we do have a super show coming up.  Did it cancel your plans?  Well, I told you Friday I'm going to be in Durango, Colorado, maybe on Wednesday.  Oh, man.  For Durango.  Get some weed? 
[02:43:00]  You're going to get some weed?  I'll be in Durango, yes.  You know, the legalized pot over there.  I heard about that.  I bet you got a lot of pot legal material.  By the way, I was laughing thinking, you guys, I watched Captain Phillips, and I was laughing  so hard.  Oh, I heard a boat movie.  About the interview we did?  About the interview.  Yeah.  They actually talked to that guy, and he said, they asked him, what was the worst moment  of your life?  Was it seeing the dead bodies or having to leave your family or living in Yemen?  And he goes, it was an interview I did on radio. 
[02:43:30]  Holy shit, yeah.  You won't let that go, huh?  I won't let it go, because I didn't like the defense you guys all gave, which is that  here's a guy, you know, sort of like, you know, floating dead bodies, genocide, eight  countries, you know, and you guys go, he gave us nothing.  Well.  You want some witty talk show guests?  You guys must have drawn it out of a fucking interesting person like that.  The second we try to draw it out, that's where you make fun of us that we don't, it's  not us.  You guys are like, hey, this guy's not clever, he's not a stand-up comic. 
[02:44:00]  No, he's a fucking traumatized Somali.  That was driving a cab a mere year ago.  Yeah, yeah.  In Minnesota, of all places.  No, that's where all the Somalis live.  I know, we learned that from him.  See, we learned something from the guy.  See, the fact that you let this dumbbell get in your head, that's where Anthony bugs me.  Oh, he did.  But, listen to the inconsistency, because now he says, well, this guy's a traumatized  thing, but when we try to get that, there's no right answer, and the drill instructor  will beat you harder if you reverse yourself.  Well, maybe, I got, we had an interview with James Lipton, we're the first ones to ever 
[02:44:30]  ask him about being a pimp, and he admitted that, and we'd.  What?  Exactly.  James Lipton was a pimp?  In France.  In France.  Yes, he was.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe it?  That's the most disgusting thing I ever heard.  It was great.  Yeah, but all of a sudden, somebody cares.  Right.  But we didn't get the credit.  All of a sudden, somebody cares.  We didn't get the credit, though.  No.  Someone else did.  Someone else got the credit.  The second person that got it out of him.  There's no one here that sends our stuff out, so, like, when our stuff goes out, it goes  out weekly.  Our genius interviews.  Yeah.  See?  It's amazing.  Now, I'm terrible. 
[02:45:00]  But when a guest comes in, all I think of is, what is Colin going to think of everything  I ask and say?  But it's not what you guys say.  It's the fact, and Jim is just as guilty.  Don't think I'm letting him cook.  You see, it's the gravitas, which you guys sit like this.  Oh, God.  Michael Shannon.  It all started with the Michael Shannon abortion that you guys call an interview.  Because he comes in, you know, oh, by the way, now point two, now that we're here, let's  discuss the whole thing.  Point two is, I was speaking to Robert Kelly yesterday. 
[02:45:30]  We don't like the fact that we'll come in and take a good trashing, which we deserve.  All of us deserve a nice trashing.  Then I'm listening to yesterday, and I think you had Bruce Springsteen and Leonardo, no, Jim  Florentine, why does he get the fucking kids' gloves treatment, and the rest of us get  hammered left and right?  What happened to Florentine?  Nothing.  What were we supposed to do?  The reverence with which Mr. Florentine is treating around here.  He had a good set yesterday.  Yeah, Jim, it was very funny.  He had a great set yesterday.  You know what, though? 
[02:46:00]  Colin is right.  We respect a good set.  I don't think we ever jumped on Florentine about anything.  His stories.  He tells his stories, and they're always like cool stories.  Because he tells it with that voice, you know, when he uses that voice.  I'm sick.  I don't know how Jim...  I'll tell you why.  He's the cool kid in class.  No, because Jim doesn't bring that on himself by jumping on everybody else.  You and Bob are the two biggest pieces of shit that jump on other people.  Florentine will not jump on you.  But that's not Jim's nature, so you don't interact with him that way, where you fucking 
[02:46:30]  slip up with you or Bob, and we get a phone call from you.  Oh, your interview's a piece of shit.  And Bob, you know what, dude?  You guys are your fucking booing, booing, booing, booing, booing, booing, booing, booing.  Yeah, when you guys come in, we're just trying to...  When you guys come in, we're just trying to survive.  Grabbing in fucking straws.  Because Florentine doesn't take shots at us, either.  It's just all nice and pleasant.  Well, I don't like it.  I'm going on record and saying I don't like it.  You're right, but at least you understand it.  I'm not denying it.  Okay.  I'm not denying there's a, what do you call it, a quid pro quo. 
[02:47:00]  A reaction is a reaction, whatever that is.  Oh, it was raised up, Joe Anthony would know six scientific terms.  It's Newton's third law, I believe.  It's Newtonian law, but I'm just saying.  We give you your props.  We give you your props, sir.  I refuse to remain silent in the face of it.  Your Long Island references are second to none.  We give you your props, sir.  T.J. Spratz.  No one paints a picture of Ron Conkma like Carl, the conk.  You know, there's a whole crew on Twitter of the conk boys. 
[02:47:30]  The conk boys.  Yeah, the conk boys.  I met a couple of them and it's so funny.  There's this one dude, Sean.  I met him.  I'm standing there like happy to be at the show.  And I'm saying, I go, you want to fight me right now?  And he goes, kind of.  Just because it's Ron Conkma.  He's just standing there.  A young guy.  That's conk.  Like this.  He's like happy to meet me with his fucking fish clothes.  You want to fight me?  Yeah.  They love fighting.  Oh, they love to fight out there.  They love to fight.  They're all just waiting for a good fight.  You know what the best place to fight was?  In front of the 7-Eleven. 
[02:48:00]  Really?  Because you could hang out there.  And it's just a parade of other jadrules like every other fucking jerk-off that's there.  So you could make trouble with anybody.  Hey, look at this fucking asshole.  And all of a sudden there's a fight.  And they probably wanted to fight too.  It's just always a fight.  Hey, Norman.  Hey, nice car, faggot.  And then you're just in a fight.  It's great.  It's neutral territory because it's just 7-Eleven. 
[02:48:30]  You sound like Jim Brewer.  Hey, faggot.  Well, Jim Brewer is a prime example of Long Island fucking...  He's a Ron Conkma guy.  No, he's from Valley Stream.  Oh, no, Valley Stream.  Oh, yeah, he's from Valley Stream.  Right, right, right.  Which, you know.  Yeah, the conk is one of the greatest trash places.  Unless maybe Mastic or fucking Shirley.  Mastic takes the cake.  Mastic is great.  Mastic is a rough, rough place.  You used to have a bungalow.  My family had a bungalow out in Mastic Beach.  We used to all go out there.  A bunch of guineas fucking head out there with the women with the fucking ziti trays and cooking. 
[02:49:00]  The guys are out by the pool drinking Schaefer beer.  And the kids are running around fucking either, you know, a miracle they didn't get abducted or drown in the pool.  And that was our fucking summer.  And the way the Italians do it, too.  You would think they're in the fucking Riviera.  They put those beach chairs out like, hey, fucking gentlemen.  There's fucking, they would set up like tiki torches and little lamps on the table like they're in Hawaii.  They're in a luau.  Oh, it was great. 
[02:49:30]  And then we would go to sleep and all we'd hear was these horrific sounds of drunk adults.  Yeah.  We'd go to sleep in like the bungalow and, you know, Shirley, your kid.  And then they would just, oh, the cigarettes and the beers.  Oh, yeah.  That was the Riviera.  That's true.  And now it's like, you know, of course, when Mastic changed, we had to hear from the relatives.  Like right when it, about when it started changing, it was, you know.  Of course.  You know what the fuck happened to the bungalow? 
[02:50:00]  We used to love that place.  Right.  Now the fucking guy took that fucking shit in.  Oh, man, believe me.  Well, it's like, you ever see Gilbert Gottfried?  Did you see that routine about Africa?  He goes, I went to Africa the other day.  It's all black over there.  Used to be you could walk around, leave your door open.  What happened?  And so, you know, does the conversation.  What happened?  They got in.  They got in.  They got in.  Really?  That's fucking great.  So funny.  Oh, that is funny, man. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, I had to hear that growing up, how they destroyed the Mastic and the bungalow and  how wonderful it was before they came in.  Because it was paradise before this?  Yes.  Oh, it was.  No.  When I tell you there was a...  Mastic was always a shithole.  When I tell you there was a three foot high, white picket fence around this house with  a little latticework gazebo.  How small was the house?  And vines.  How about tomatoes and mustard, too?  It was fucking...  The house was as big as this room. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was very tiny.  Two levels, maybe.  But it was as big as this room.  In their fucking sandals with their black socks working on the big cigars.  The big guinea-stink of cigars.  All the women with their cat glasses in front of a slop sink, peeling potatoes.  A slop sink.  Yeah.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It was beautiful.  It was just for the days until fucking...  You know what happened there.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, mama.  Paradise.  Mama.  You didn't have to drive very far back then, you know, to get to paradise. 
[02:51:30]  Fucking Collins.  No, Chatea Napoli.  Should we get the...  Madame.  Should we get a lady dying on the phone, at least?  What?  Why not?  If you're not going to be part of the super show?  Oh, man.  We're doing the super show for you.  I'm sorry.  This whole thing is for you.  I warned you guys.  I said I couldn't make it.  Jimmy can't do it.  See, we do nice things for you.  That was all set up for you.  I know you guys did.  And Jimmy's not going to be here?  We should cancel the super show.  Yeah, we should just reschedule it.  I mean, just for the other day.  Let's call Lady Di and cancel it right now. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  She has a right to know.  We'll try to get her on the phone.  La Chatea Napoli.  So, Jimmy, you got some zingers for today?  Yeah.  I'm going to open up and talk to my boomer's head.  I'm going to go, that's a big head.  What do you make doors special or something?  That's a good one right there.  Could you imagine the bomb that would be?  Do you know how bad I want to go up his chip?  If I had an ounce of moral courage, because I'm not a fryer, I would just go on his chip.  Bomb.  Yeah, but you want to kill up there.  Of course.  Of course you do. 
[02:52:30]  I wouldn't do it, but I want to.  It would be funny.  How come you, why'd they call you a boomer?  What, did you fall down a lot?  That's good.  You should do that.  That's a good one.  You look at the guy.  You got it?  Who else is doing it?  He's laughing at it.  He's laughing.  He got it.  He's laughing.  He's doing it.  Jeff Garland's the host.  Jeff Ross is doing it, of course.  Jeff Ross, of course.  Carrie Keegan.  Larry King.  I don't know if he's doing it.  Larry King.  Jerry Lewis.  I don't know if he's actually doing it.  Jerry Lewis. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know if he's doing it, but he's there.  I should look at my fucking list of people.  Jerry Lewis.  Do you got some Jerry Lewis material?  Larry King will do a set.  Oh, man.  Maybe.  Dan Marino.  He likes doing that now.  Yeah.  That's his thing.  Carton is doing it.  Yeah.  I don't have a whole shitload of stuff for Tom Cotter, Bill Cower.  Time Warner guy?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Hold on a minute.  I'm going to say something about him.  Do you make fun of Jerry's kids?  No.  For Bill Cower.  I mean, it's a pretty big mustache. 
[02:53:30]  What's that?  A flavor saver?  That's a good one right there.  Hi.  Who's this?  It's Lady Di.  Oh, Lady Di.  Sounds aggrieved.  It's Lady Di.  Your boyfriend's in studio.  Colin Quinn.  Hi, Lady Di.  Hi.  How you doing, Colin?  Good.  How are you?  Hey, when are we going to go out on a date already?  Oh, boy.  She's already sauced.  She's already sauced.  Hey, Lady Di, you've got to answer a couple questions. 
[02:54:00]  Here to set this up.  How many Natty Lights have you had this morning?  I don't know.  About six, maybe?  She's six Natty Ice's deep at 10A.  Yeah, six.  You probably had more like 10,000.  No, I did not have 10,000.  Oh, well.  Here we go.  I heard literal.  Yeah, ding.  Okay.  The most literal person on earth.  She was ding.  What else?  Lady Di, what do you have planned for today? 
[02:54:30]  What's your day look like?  Yeah, what?  Are you running for president?  No.  Okay.  Well, thank you for that info.  Well, we were told you were going to go scuba diving today.  No.  Oh.  No scuba diving today.  No, you're not.  Okay.  What are you doing?  Today?  Not really that much right now.  You should say it.  It's freezing cold out for crying out loud.  That's true.  But she's got to look for a job.  What do you want me to do?  Not today.  Well, we want you to look for a job. 
[02:55:00]  I want you to relax today and have a you day.  Just a lady die day.  Yes.  I haven't been looking for a job.  No, you haven't.  You can't go out in this weather.  She's been looking for a job, guys.  Where have you looked?  Let's hear about the progress of looking for the job.  Run us through the last job interview you were on.  Go.  Dollar store?  I did not have a job interview.  I put in application.  Where did you put in an application last?  Grocery stores, cashier jobs, stuff like that. 
[02:55:30]  Where?  Where?  Yeah.  In Elizabeth, New Jersey.  What grocery store?  What grocery store in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Okay.  Do I have to really run it down?  Yes.  Yes, you do.  Which one?  Tell us.  All right.  On Moore Avenue, on Siobras over there.  What?  Siobras.  Siobras.  On Moore Avenue.  And when did this application go in? 
[02:56:00]  Last month.  Last month?  Yes.  It's the end of this month.  That's two months.  Yes, Jimmy.  That's where I'm at.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jesus.  She's tanked.  Well, who am I talking to you?  No, I'm not tanked.  She's got natty, icy ears right now.  Well, if it's not Jimmy, who do you think?  There's not many choices.  Let me give you some advice.  It's college.  I'm telling you right now, these guys can't browbeat you into answering these questions.  You're an American citizen.  You've got, you know, obviously some benefits coming in from somewhere, right? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  So take a little time for yourself to reflect.  You know, like those college kids go to Europe for a year when they get out?  Yeah.  Same thing.  Just take some time to figure out what you want to do with your life.  Don't rush into a job.  That's ridiculous.  Well, let's ask her.  What do you want to do with your life?  Rushing with, rushing, Colin, rushing to a job.  You know what I want her to do with her life?  End it.  Let me tell you something right now.  This week has been very busy for me.  Let's hear about it.  Go on. 
[02:57:00]  Do you really want to hear about it?  Yes.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You're fine doing nothing.  Fucking bitch.  No, no.  We had to get a new box for you and mattress.  Of course you did.  Yes.  Pressure.  What was the back spring turning into a diamond?  Yeah.  What did you do with the other one?  Just roll it up like a fucking piece of paper and take it out?  Fast.  You're flattened.  Use it for a rolling paper.  No, no, no.  Just this week.  No, no, no.  Oh, okay.  We thought that might have been the thing.  Yeah.  Probably because of all the pee stains.  She probably pees herself. 
[02:57:30]  Absolutely.  Did you wet yourself?  Vomit.  Did you wet?  Vomit.  Yeah.  No, I did not.  No, we had to replace everything.  The furniture.  Why?  What happened?  Bed bugs?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Exactly.  Wait, bed bugs?  Yeah, yeah.  You had bed bugs?  Yes, I did.  Of course you did, you monster.  How did you get?  And actually, it was the bed bugs that tried to replace the furniture.  They're like the two drunken elephants on our house. 
[02:58:00]  We had to replace the mattress, the box spring, and the couch.  Do you know you replaced that, but if you don't get rid of the bed bugs, they're just  going to reinfest.  Yeah, right.  No, no, no.  They're not going to reinfest.  Yeah?  Yeah.  There's going to be an exterminator in here pretty soon.  Wait, pretty soon?  It's already in your new shit.  What if you replace the furniture?  No, we got to pray for that.  Oh, no.  Oh, you dummy.  Wait, how did you get bed bugs, first of all? 
[02:58:30]  I have no idea.  I guess they were already in this building when we came in here.  Oh, that's true.  They could be in the building.  Oh, my God.  So you got the bed bugs.  Hold on a second.  Oh, my God.  Die.  Die.  Lovely.  When did you get rid of the actual box springing mattress and furniture?  Uh, three days ago.  Why?  So you get the new furniture in already?  Yeah.  I've never in my life spoken to a stupid person.  So you did that before the exterminator came.  Your furniture's reinfested. 
[02:59:00]  You know that.  That's like your house is on fire, and you put the new furniture in before they put the  fire up.  That's what you did.  Why don't you guys come over here and take a look at everything?  Yeah.  That's what I want to bring.  The whole thing is.  Bed bugs on us?  Back to my house.  That's great.  Why don't you have Roscoe, the bed bug sniffing dog, come by and you can feed him some peanut  butter off of that fucking disaster between your legs?  No, no.  No, no, no.  I'm just telling you that.  She's telling you it's not exactly.  She's telling you she had a busy week, guys.  Yes.  Yeah.  And it's freezing cold, too, by the way. 
[02:59:30]  That doesn't help.  I was the one that had to go out and get everything.  Oh, God forbid you do something.  So what did your roommate do?  Just want to say they're in lounge in the bed bugs?  They're probably better companies.  I'm going to miss you guys.  You can't come in for the super show.  You got bed bugs.  Yeah.  What's he talking about?  Can we get the cops to bring over one of those things they put, like, people they arrest  from a murder scene where they're just wearing the white jumpsuit?  That's a great idea.  Did they make you do that?  Yeah.  That's so they have the evidence.  It seals up all the evidence that might be on a person. 
[03:00:00]  No, no, no.  Well, first of all, the facade that we purchased is plastic.  It's not even cotton.  All right?  So.  Oh, yeah.  Because bed bugs are really particular about cotton or fucking foam rubber.  Yes.  They prefer sateen sheets.  The bed bugs were on Reddit, complaining.  Oh, my God.  You don't have them right now.  What?  You have bed bugs.  Where do you think they went?  They just, they're in the rugs or.  Exactly.  You don't think they.  They got spray.  I don't have a rug over here. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  There's no rug.  What about your clothes?  Yeah, your clothes.  What about in the closet there?  Not me either.  What about where you keep your towels?  What's on the floor?  Wood floors?  You got a mat?  No, just a welcome mat.  Yeah, I know.  You have a mat?  No, I just have a welcome mat.  All right.  No, they called me.  I didn't call them.  They're everywhere.  All those bed bugs are everywhere.  Wait, who's bitching at you?  I'm telling you, we don't have anything right now.  Who just was bitching at you that we called you? 
[03:01:00]  Who's yelling?  I was the one yelling at Bill because Bill gave me a dirty look.  Yeah, but Bill hasn't talked to Colin yet, so put him on the phone.  Yeah.  Well, hold on.  He's going to the bathroom right now.  Can you hold on?  In the kitchen.  He's just shitting into the lettuce tray.  Just shitting on our head.  No, no, no.  He had to.  No, no, no.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought he actually was.  Oh, P.  You're mistaken.  I'm sorry.  I thought he really was shitting on your head. 
[03:01:30]  How about that moment of people Greg go see your head when you step on that welcome mat  and you're about to ring the bell.  Have you listened to the news lately?  Yes.  What?  What about the news?  There was a big fire down the street from my house.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God you're okay.  Well, thank you very much.  I hate that down the street from was in that sentence.  Someone obviously got the wrong address.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Die.  Yeah.  You should have died in the fire. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  What?  No, he didn't feel like talking.  He just went back to sleep.  Oh, okay.  Right in the bedbugs.  Lady Di, you're always talking?  Right back into his drunken stupor.  You're not coming in.  You got bedbugs.  Exactly.  I don't have any bedbugs on me.  Yes, you do.  How did you find out you had bedbugs in the first place?  They're very tiny.  Well, we said she has bedbugs.  It's probably something even worse.  AIDS.  Yeah.  Ticks.  You got cats in that house? 
[03:02:30]  Please, maybe?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Do you have animals in the house?  What?  What?  What?  No, there's no animals.  No, we're not allowed pets over here.  Oh.  So why are you there?  Yeah, really?  How many times has a maintenance worker tried to shoo you out, and then when you spoke,  you went, oh, my apologies.  I thought you were a monster.  Do you have, so there's no fleas?  Any cockroaches?  Crabs?  Crabs?  No, no, no.  We don't have anything.  Do you have chiggers?  No, no.  I hate the chiggers. 
[03:03:00]  They get in everything.  Hey, do you, Lady Di, how did you find out you had bedbugs?  Well, it's very simple.  Yeah.  The couch that was here before had the bedbugs on them.  But how did you find out?  They're very small.  You don't see them.  You told me you did the couch.  You had them.  She did, didn't she?  Yeah, how did you find out?  How did you find out?  What made you go, I think we have bedbugs?  A sting operation?  Did you dress like a bedbug and sit there until they spoke to you?  What beach of furniture did you notice today? 
[03:03:30]  I did not say anything.  Flap scam.  Lady Di.  Lady Di, what piece of furniture would you notice?  How did you know you had bedbugs?  Were they on your fist chair?  What item of furniture were they in?  The couch that was here before.  All right, that answers your question.  But how did you know you had bedbugs?  Yes.  Yeah, what symptoms did you get?  What symptoms? 
[03:04:00]  There was no symptoms.  So how did you know you had bedbugs?  Yeah, did you have a vision that there are bedbugs in there?  Were they crawling on you?  How did you know?  How did you know?  How did I know that I had this?  Yes.  This is exhausting.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to be a big hit with this right now.  Yeah.  Okay, I knew because in the corners of the couch, it was high to bed.  All right?  The corners usually has the little eggs in them. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  That's how we do.  And we had to throw that couch away.  All right?  All right?  What made you check there?  Di, what made you check there?  Well, actually, I didn't check anything.  It was Bill that was doing all the checking.  Yeah, of course.  You're too busy drinking Natty Ices.  Yeah, really?  She had welts all over us, those zits.  I guarantee she had.  It's over there, Bill.  I think I see an egg.  Actually, let's just change the subject a little bit.  Why?  I was drinking Milwaukee's Best Ice back then.  Oh.  The Beast. 
[03:05:00]  Drinking the Beast.  God damn.  Who doesn't love a can of the Beast?  Someone's doing a little promo.  Oh, yeah.  Someone got paid.  Someone didn't get a check out to her.  Got an endorsement deal.  Product placement.  Hold on.  Someone really wants to talk to you, and it's not leaving.  Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Can I just tell you how infuriating it is to have to drive to work every day and listen  to this bitch babble about drinking beer at 10 o'clock in the morning, and the rest 
[03:05:30]  of us go to work?  Yeah.  This is a drive-time show.  All the listeners are going to work.  It's your six Natty Ices in on a Thursday.  Later, boys.  Thank you.  Yeah, you piss off a lot of people.  I'm sorry.  How many Natty Ices will you drink today?  I don't know.  About?  Well, about?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe about 10 more.  How many?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  16. 
[03:06:00]  That would be a total of 16 beers.  That's why I'm looking for a job.  Yeah, yeah.  All soused.  Yeah.  That's great.  And you don't understand why no one's hiring you.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  I understand.  So you got a new pull.  That was a pull-out bed that was in the couch, right?  That was a pull-out bed.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  First of all, first of all, when we first moved in, all right, it was a hide-a-bed.  All right?  And that's where they were.  I mean, I'm not blaming anybody in the building.  I'm not saying anything about it. 
[03:06:30]  Wait, wait.  You moved in and used the bed that was there?  No.  No.  I just sat on it, but I didn't use it.  I'll tell you right now.  I think it was somebody in the building.  I know you're not blaming me.  You're too good-hearted.  Oh, boy.  But I think somebody in Brooklyn.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Where else?  Where there's smoke, there's fire.  If anybody can call in and tell me how this happens.  Yeah.  If anyone in the world can call in and tell me how this happens.  Hey, guess what?  Even the rich, oh, what's that hotel?  Hell, the world of the story had bedbugs five years ago.  That could happen anyway. 
[03:07:00]  Ah, and that's fucking, yeah.  That's true.  A high-class drink.  Yeah, it sure is.  Right.  I mean, I'm just saying, how in the world does something like this happen?  It just occurs.  Somebody brings in, you know, somebody in the building.  Not you, but one of the other people.  Oh, filth.  Yeah, dirt.  Fucking lack of cleaning.  Yeah.  You're not very well-kempt.  It's something to be ashamed of some of the finest hotels in the world.  Remember the bedbug scare of five years ago?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Hey, Lady Di, did you get any welts where they were biting you?  Of course.  Any what?  Where were they biting you? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, God.  Where were the welts?  Every question takes five minutes.  Where did they bite you?  Holy fuck.  No, they like to bite people on the legs and the arms.  But that's not the question.  Where did they bite you?  On the couch.  On the couch.  On the couch.  They've hit me on the couch.  Once again.  Where did they bite you, Lady Di?  I like to see what I'm going to try.  On my legs and arms.  Your legs and arms got welts from the bedbugs. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, of course.  I don't have anything like that, but.  They must have thought they were at the biggest smorgasbord ever.  You know how many bedbugs had to see bedbug doctors  and find they had too much cholesterol and fat in their diet?  You've got to quit drinking.  And they were alcoholics.  Right.  Did you put alcohol on that?  It cures it, I think, the little man of ice.  Little old Milwaukee.  Actually, they stopped biting me.  Because they did not like the way my blood tastes. 
[03:08:30]  That's great.  Of course not.  You're all pickled.  Yeah, they thought you were a giant fat sterile machine.  If you want to know the truth, that's the truth.  They stopped biting you.  They actually stopped biting me at one point.  Yeah, they did.  No, we went through.  This is my fourth couch.  I bet.  So, wait, you keep not getting rid of them and buying new couches?  Well, we have to.  Now, what do you, you know, I mean, I don't know how much further I have to go with this, 
[03:09:00]  but Bill is the one that paid for two beds and the two couches.  All right?  I believe I paid for one, you know, for the third one.  Where are you getting your furniture?  On the side of the road or Ikea?  Where are you going for this shit?  The furniture place is gone.  By the way, she cannot come back in the studio.  Because Liz Sets Fire on Twitter writes, 
[03:09:30]  you guys saw the bites on her arms last time she was in.  She said they were fly bites.  I said they were bed bug bites.  You remember, right?  I said they were bed bug bites.  We saw bites on her arms.  Oh, man.  And she was itching them.  I said that.  What the fuck is that?  And she said she got bit by a fly.  Maybe she has flies and bed bugs.  Maybe.  I forgot about that.  It could happen.  Now you don't want me to come back?  No, I said that she had bed bugs.  You got bed bugs.  Jesus Christ.  I don't have any bed bugs on me right now.  Brundle hippo.  Lady Di, you guys, you know how they joke around. 
[03:10:00]  You're welcome here any time.  You know that.  You're not going to be here, Colin.  I saw those.  I know, bud.  Look at that.  I know, bud.  Quit.  You're welcome any time.  You show up.  We're all going to let you right up.  We're not going to let you up, though.  We're going to bite on you.  Bites on you.  Hold on a minute.  I won't give you guys a minute.  People want in so bad.  Lady Di, would you talk to Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve.  Nice.  I don't want to talk to anybody about this.  I don't care.  I want him to check out your cooch.  Yeah.  Lady Di, where were they biting you? 
[03:10:30]  I want to punish Dr. Steve and make him look at her cooch.  Dr. Ian.  Yeah, but I want to know.  I just told you.  Yeah, this is Dr. Steve.  I haven't heard.  Aw, were they itchy?  No.  No.  I didn't even know until the next day.  How would you?  You dope.  You were sleeping.  Can you hold on a second?  I can't.  Why?  I have to pop open a beer.  You think I'm joking, right? 
[03:11:00]  No, we know you're not joking.  No, we know you're not.  Hold on, hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  And it goes, ugh, and walks away.  It's disgusting.  This is our seventh Natty Ice.  Yeah, number seven.  It's 1020.  All right, I'm back.  All right, you got a nice Natty Ice in your hand?  I love a good beer, but wow.  All right, let me talk to John in Indiana.  John.  Hey, old bae guys.  Hey, Colin.  Hey.  Lady died at 16 Natty Ice today. 
[03:11:30]  She didn't need a job, man.  She's sitting on a multi-million dollar recycling company.  That's true.  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  If there was another brewery around here someplace, I'd be working there.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, yeah.  Listen, do you bring your empties back?  No, no, they're cans.  They're cans.  You don't bring cans back.  You bring bottles back.  What?  She had a good point.  No.  I drink out of a can, not a bottle.  But the cans are a nickel deposit also. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, you know what?  All right.  That reminds me of something.  There is one person that comes over here every once in a while and checks out our garbage.  Yeah.  Of course they do.  Driving up in a Cadillac.  It's a Cadillac.  Right.  In a tuxedo.  That person probably brought over the bedbugs.  Checks out your garbage.  Yeah.  They'll be a gynecologist.  He pulls up. 
[03:12:30]  I don't need a gynecologist.  Oh, she doesn't need one.  Well, she had to answer that.  The bedbugs clean everything out.  That guy pulls up in a tractor trailer every once a week.  Why are you letting him have all that money?  That guy hit the fucking lottery.  Yeah.  He probably has a college football team.  A fraternity house.  One woman.  Why don't you take him back yourself?  What'd you say again?  Oh, God.  It's exhausting.  She's getting a good question. 
[03:13:00]  If you take him back to Michigan, you get a dime.  That's right.  But you've got to figure out the gas and everything.  Yes.  People are saying I'm getting lazy for calling you out.  She should be Leno's last guest.  Will you answer the question?  Yes, I will.  Go ahead.  She could sing, you are the wind beneath my hooves.  No, if she said you are the wind beneath my wing, somebody would say when pigs fly. 
[03:13:30]  Did you ever know I need a hero?  No, really, I need one.  Will you answer the question?  Yes, Lady Di.  She says, what was it like to be in my shadow?  And she's talking to the entire East Coast.  She's heavyset.  Yes.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Answer the question.  I would not even know where to take them.  All right.  All right.  You take them to the place you bought them. 
[03:14:00]  That would be great parking money, man.  That would add up.  Take them back to the liquor store?  Yes.  You don't even know how to take empties back?  If you take the cans back to the liquor store, they will take the money.  They will give you a nickel for every can.  No, cans are 50 cents a piece.  Oh, that's right.  Cans are 50 cents a piece.  Yeah, not the ice cans.  Cans are 50 cents a piece.  Cans are 50 cents a piece.  Yep.  Bottles are cheaper.  Because of recycling, you dope. 
[03:14:30]  They're 50 cents a piece if you bring them back.  Because of the green energy thing.  Yes.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Just one second.  10 cents in Michigan.  Well, you got to go on on that one.  I did that already.  She's like, hold on.  She's doing math.  She's adding up a six pack.  She's looking for a calculator.  I heard not in Jersey.  What is she doing?  Is that the thing?  Jersey doesn't want to get involved with that whole fucking...  What was that?  Five cents.  Can't.  Yeah.  There's no deposit on cans.  Yes, there are.  Okay.  You can listen to the guy who has bed bugs, or you can listen to five people in a radio 
[03:15:00]  show.  Who just went back to bed at 10.30 in the morning.  50 cents.  Keep throwing it out.  I don't care what you do.  Yeah, whatever.  Take it to the liquor store.  They'll give you 50 cents a can, you dummy.  50 cents a can.  50 cents a can in New Jersey?  Yes.  They can get New York, but not New Jersey.  Oh, New Jersey.  Yeah, no.  Jersey doesn't do that.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  All right.  Well, you don't have to think so.  I'm telling you what it is.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  Are you going to the Super Bowl? 
[03:15:30]  What are you doing for Super Bowl Sunday?  Oh, we're going to have it here.  Of course.  Are you?  With the bed bugs?  With the bed bugs.  That's wonderful.  You're going to have a little fucking, like the puppy bowl and the kitten bowl, the bed  bug bowl over at fucking Lady Di's house.  Oh.  That's great.  Everyone gets to bring a gift back home with them.  Imagine that Super Bowl party.  Yeah.  Colin's in pain.  The fucking bed bugs.  Look at her guests' cruise ships.  Out of that shithole. 
[03:16:00]  To a better life.  Hold on a second.  What?  If Marion's listening to the show, we don't have any bed bugs anymore.  That is the final.  Oh.  Marion wants to come over for the Super Bowl party and she doesn't want bed bugs, right?  Yes.  We'll tell Marion about the bed bugs.  Don't you worry.  We'll let her know.  We'll let her know about the bed bugs.  You know what?  I already told her enough about that.  Yes.  No, I think I'll, we'll tell her.  Yeah.  We'll make sure she understands.  I think you're a bias on your, um, yeah.  Yeah.  Your bed bug. 
[03:16:30]  What's next to us?  You're infested.  With all sorts of bugs over there.  You're infested.  I'm not infested.  I saw bed bug bites on you and I said I think you have bed bugs when she was in.  What other critters do you have in the house?  You got a mouse problem?  You got rats?  What do you got?  I bet you got wolverines in the house, don't you?  What?  You have wolverines?  Colin, please protect me on this one.  Hey, Jim, she doesn't have wolverines.  All right.  I apologize.  Oh, that's her cute, curly laugh. 
[03:17:00]  She's so smitten with Colin.  She loves Colin.  That's her flirty laugh.  Yes, flirty.  I love Colin.  I love Colin.  We all done.  We just heard it.  All giggly.  That was great.  You made Colin.  Broken slob.  Maybe you can answer her singles ad on Match.com.  Lonely girl at Elizabeth wants ass-eat and provides bed bugs and welts.  Oh, that's smitten laugh. 
[03:17:30]  You made it die.  Colin, I love you.  Are you thinking about...  Are you squirting again just thinking about it?  Oh, yeah.  Discharging?  Remember when you discharged?  You were discharging?  Yes, I remember when I was discharging.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking about Colin right now.  Ooh, baby.  Ooh, baby.  Oh, my God.  You have a little phone sex.  Oh, wow.  Baby.  I always liked Colin. 
[03:18:00]  The inside of her panties looks like when you dump mashed potatoes in the sink drain.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, gosh.  No, no, no.  Oh, they don't.  They don't.  No, no, no.  Okay, they don't.  Okay, they don't.  Okay, they don't.  All right.  Wow.  Lady Di is ready for action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lady Di, if you come in here in, like, some kind of hazmat suit, we'll let you in for  Super Bowl, the Super Show.  Super Show 2.  I don't need the hazmat suit.  I'm telling you, I don't have it.  Something.  She's got to wear something.  Yeah, we'll get it. 
[03:18:30]  We'll get some kind of...  Do we still have the bee costume?  Well, they have the...  Wait a minute.  They have the suitcases.  We'll find...  They made bed bug-free suit.  You get a costume made out of the same material.  Oh, yeah.  We need bed bug-free suitcases.  They have suitcases that make sure you don't get bed bugs, like when people travel.  What is that?  Some material.  I don't know.  It's made of it.  No, it's made of it.  Some kind of heat thing where they can't live in there.  Oh, they don't like it.  That's a lie.  No, I swear to God.  I believe you.  I don't believe the suitcase.  That's a lie.  Wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Let me send you guys straight on something. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  They don't like to live in the cold.  Oh!  She's 100% right.  No, I never heard that.  No, it's true.  Oh.  They flourish in the heat.  So freeze them out of your house.  Yeah, why don't you open up the windows?  Open up the windows.  What?  They're gone.  She's trying to tell you.  I bet they're not.  She's a new couch.  She's a new life.  I'm going home.  All right.  Yeah, we got to meet with Donnie.  We have a little meeting right at 1030.  Lady Di, thank you.  You're always a fucking... 
[03:19:30]  Thank you.  We'll see you next...  You're so welcome.  We'll see you next Friday, but we're going to put you in some kind of fucking bee costume  or something.  That would be the best line of the show.  Lady Di.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, you.  Are you going to be there next time?  Oh, that was the last one.  Manding.  She's asking if you're going to be there.  Jimmy, where are you going to be?  I'll be in Colorado.  You better be there, Hill.  You're still on the phone. 
[03:20:00]  We said bye to you.  I couldn't help it.  She looked like Robert Taylor.  She looked like Lawrence Taylor.  Yeah, she looked like Lawrence Taylor.  Those bloodshot eyes.

Do you know how easy it would be to fuck that monster?  I love having the same fucking conversation with her over and over again.  It doesn't matter.  It's the exact same conversation every single time, and I love it.  I never get tired of it.  All right, we're going home.  We're going home. </pre>
