<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the hosts' ongoing, and frustrating, contract negotiations with their boss, Ken Stevens.  They jokingly threatened to refuse to sign unless they received a Rush Limbaugh-level salary,  with their producer, Rick Delgado, frantically trying to get them to sign.  This negotiation storyline recurred throughout the broadcast, punctuated by jokes about Stevens's potential affair and the mysterious disappearance of a woman involved, drawing comparisons to the Chandra Levy case.

A major portion of the show focused on "Whip Em Out Wednesday,"  a listener-participation segment where women flashed their breasts to listeners displaying a "WOW" sign. The hosts reiterated the rules (no harassment, no following) and announced its expansion to new cities.  This segment generated numerous listener calls throughout the broadcast, with some recounting their encounters with the "WOW" van.

The show heavily featured a recent Fox News segment about Opie and Anthony.  The hosts and Jim Norton (a frequent in-studio guest) dissected the report, mocking Rick Delgado's awkward interview performance. The segment also highlighted the show's controversial nature and various segments, including listener reactions.

The broadcast included a diverse mix of other segments.  A Casey Kasem American Top 40 clip was played, showcasing Kasem's anger over the show's transitions between song tempos, particularly during death dedications.  A "Whippermount Wednesday" call from "Stalker Patty" confronted Stinky about being seen near the studio, prompting discussion involving a comedian, Jim, and his own encounter with her.  Several calls followed, including one from Earl promoting a "WOW sticker" giveaway (with a hilariously long and repetitive voicemail message), and a caller, Michael, recounting a bizarre story about a Cinemax short film (not a documentary, as later clarified) depicting a man being shot for $500 during a tattoo session. This story was debated and corroborated by other callers.  An interview clip with Cheryl from Big Brother featuring her recounting a story about filling condoms with water was played, generating comedic reactions from the hosts.  A call from a self-proclaimed Chinese food delivery person included explicit and offensive language. Commercials for Lifestyles condoms (highlighting their new "discs" packaging), O2Go oxygenated water, and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed were interspersed throughout.

Another significant segment featured Jackie Fine, a relationship specialist promoting Viacream, a female arousal cream. This interview, with Johnny B from the Jerky Boys and Frank Rizzo also present, became extremely sexually explicit and offensive, involving graphic descriptions and crude jokes from both the hosts and the guests.  Listener calls during this segment were equally crude and sexually suggestive.  The hosts later apologized for the inappropriate nature of some calls.  This segment also included promotions for Johnny B's new CD and further discussions about female anatomy, often using graphic language. Callers recounted the day's events in a "What Did We Learn" segment, and concert tickets and Johnny B.'s CD were given away.

A bizarre phone call with a caller named Chris who claimed to be a fast baseball player wanting to be signed by the Yankees opened another segment. The conversation devolved into exaggerated boasts, insults towards Derek Jeter, and a ludicrous baseball costume plan.  This was followed by further discussion of the hosts’ contract negotiations, focusing on Ken Stevens's procurement of an exorbitantly expensive pen ($250 rental fee for a $2500 pen).  A prank call segment featuring Frank Rizzo was also included.  Finally, Johnny B himself called in, discussing his work with the Jerky Boys, the movie based on their calls, and the challenges of obtaining permission from those called; interspersed with calls from other individuals, including one about a fight on the Jerky Boys set.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Break it down!  Please, wow!  We love seeing boobs.  Please, wow!  Love it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  Yeah, close up.  Rip a loud wedding day.  A brilliant idea.  Swing!  There's a cure for cancer.  You're ignorant!  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, we're here. Sorry.  Oh, my God.  The boss is following us down the hall, begging us to sign our contracts. 
[00:00:30]  Jesus, could you just sign it before the show?  Like, no.  Not until you cough up the Rush Limbaugh money.  That's right.  Where's the Rush Limbaugh money?  It's starting to sink in now.  We got a bad deal.  Yeah, we haven't signed it yet, so screw it.  All right, this could be our last show.  That was pretty funny, though.  He's following us down the hall with a pen.  I know.  Guys, can you do it?  It's like, during a break.  We agreed to stay here two months ago. 
[00:01:00]  It's not our fault it took two months for the lawyers to figure out our contract.  The wording.  Oh, my God.  He was sweating profusely as he's following us with a pen.  I swear to God, we haven't had a chance to sit down and discuss anything today.  Yeah.  So, here we are.  It's, yeah, Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Chasing us with the Ken Stevens pen.  What happened?  What?  What's going on?  What?  Ben's flipping out.  I don't know.  I thought you were pulling a spasm.  Remember the day you guys didn't show up? 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  And then Jeremy comes in and goes, oh, yeah, the contract just got all messed up.  So, I didn't know if he was kidding or not.  And so, then I just, I didn't know what to do.  So, I just, you know.  Ben needs us to sign bad.  I guess they have us getting screwed tomorrow and they want us locked in.  We're the stupid ones for not signing.  Knowing us, we'll just screw it up.  I know.  Oh.  So, I guess we'll sign tomorrow officially?  I guess so.  He wants us signing today.  He wants us signing right now.  Yeah.  He was sweating. 
[00:02:00]  With the big Ken Stevens pen.  The big Ken Stevens pen.  Mr. Spacely and his pen.  Jetson?  Sign this contract, Jetson.  All right, Mr. Spacely.  Hey, it's fake Fred.  Know what's really weird, though?  Yeah.  He goes, no, I got time now.  Sign it now.  I'm like, we have a show.  Oh, that thing.  We're on the air.  Well, that's why we're signing the contract.  So, we can continue doing radio shows, right?  Oh, is that what it's all about?  All right, Anthony.  Hey.  Whip Em Out Wednesday is here once again. 
[00:02:30]  How you doing?  Want to say hi to everybody?  We have to explain Whip Em Out Wednesday every Wednesday for the new Cetés.  Listen to the collective.  Oh, from like New York and Philly.  And Philly.  They're on board now.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It has to be said, Anthony, the greatest radio promotion ever, ever, ever.  Well, yeah.  Because there's so many winners.  Everyone's a winner.  I mean, we could explain the whole bumper sticker thing that other radio stations do. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, well, you know, you put a bumper sticker and if the van from the station, the van driver sees it.  Just happens to be behind you.  Oh, yeah.  And he pulls you over.  Pulls you over.  You win maybe tickets and a chance to put your name in a drawing to win a good prize.  After you yell and scream at the van driver for pulling you over because you're late for something.  Right.  He hands you, like, tickets to see, I don't know, Journey with the Fake Singer.  Oh, gee, thanks.  Thanks for throwing me a bone.  But with Whip Em Out Wednesday, every woman on the street is a potential prize giver. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right.  So you have the wow on your vehicle somewhere.  The girl sees it.  If she feels so inclined, she pulls up next to you and shows you those fabulous boobs.  That's right.  Brass, fun bags, whatever you want to call them.  So a lot of the radio stations that we're on are making their own Whip Em Out Wednesday stickers.  But in the meantime, we like the grassroots effort.  We love the people that just write wow in the back of their car, whether it's in masking tape or you write it in the dirt that's on your car. 
[00:04:00]  And then just drive around and hopefully a lady will flash you.  That's what Whip Em Out Wednesday is about.  And it takes time.  In the new cities, it's going to take a little time.  But don't be surprised if it does happen to you, okay?  Yeah.  Two rules, and it works like a charm.  It's worked like this for the last seven years that we have done this, or seven seasons, or whatever we're up to now.  Please do not harass the ladies.  No.  And please do not follow the ladies.  There are plenty of ladies out there that will do this because they want to.  Don't force any lady to do it, okay?  Yeah.  And that's all we ask from you guys. 
[00:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  And so far, everyone in New York and Philadelphia are very cool with that.  Right.  All right?  Enjoy.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027.  1027, for everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4-WOW.  Oh, we only got a few minutes left to get people laughing.  Because it's only 20 minutes.  We only got 20 minutes to get people laughing.  As per the man behind the picture, the scene. 
[00:05:00]  No, he's the brains of the operation.  The brains behind the operation, Rick Delgado, the producer, the head producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  If you saw the Fox News report here in New York last night, here he comes.  Everyone just bow.  The head producer is here.  The brains, I believe they said.  Rick, what is this now?  We got, what, 22 minutes?  I mean, 12 minutes.  12 minutes left for the people to start laughing or else what?  They what?  It's not their radio station. 
[00:05:30]  Then turn the station.  It's not, what is it, Rick?  You win a toaster.  Rick, what was the quote?  What was the quote?  What was the quote, Rick?  What was the blatant contradiction of what I said in just the scene right before that?  Oh, Anthony, I believe I have it right here.  Oh, do you?  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex.  No.  Listen to the show, and if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've  got the wrong station.  You stupid hooker. 
[00:06:00]  The best part of that clip I was watching, thanks to the Yankees and the Phillies for  effing us over last night.  Holy S.  At least the Yankees won.  Did you get the feeling that it was going to be one of those games that lasted until  three in the morning?  I know, yeah.  I was starting to get that.  I broke stuff in my living room because the Phillies couldn't score.  Phillies couldn't get anything going, man.  Here I am rooting for the Phillies.  No offense to everyone.  No wonder they didn't score.  I was rooting for the Phillies because I wanted the game to be over so they could go right 
[00:06:30]  to our feature on the 10 o'clock news on Fox.  No wonder they didn't win the game last night.  Opie was rooting for them.  So I picked up a throw pillow when they didn't score.  What inning was that?  The 10th or 11th when they had first and second no outs?  I picked up a throw pillow from my living room and just took out a whole display in the  living room.  You didn't throw your blankie?  No.  No, someone was a little pissed off.  I kind of broke some stuff.  Uh-oh.  I want to see what they were going to do with the Fox piece, you know? 
[00:07:00]  Ah, you got the wrong station.  Uh-uh.  Jim Norton in the studio.  And Norton, holy smoke.  There's Fox.  You know, give it up for Fox.  They showed a girl squatting right on Norton.  Yeah.  We did not see your face on Fox.  No.  As you shouldn't have.  Here's audio from Norton.  How many guests?  Cabbage. 
[00:07:30]  Got to give Fox a lot of credit.  They're showing fat chicks all pixelated.  They're barely pixelated.  Yeah.  Just somebody on the message board was saying that.  Oh, my God.  Fox rules.  Big fat tees on the channel.  Big fat tees.  what what wait i don't know rick i got crammed and was smoother on the sixty four thousand  dollars i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not and gorton 10 minutes left start laughing i think

[00:23:00]  but no  uh  whatever  we could get into it when we play the piece  but uh  we said a lot about howard  some good stuff too  but of course you know  they're not interested in that ever  yeah  god that's funny  friggin rick man  just gonna break  all right  just gonna break  we'll play the audio from the  the news piece in a few minutes  and there's a lot of good stuff in there  yes rick  i just gotta give a beer from the O.P.

[00:24:00]  but as we go to break  matt lauer  discusses  whip them out wednesday  on jay leno  how about the woman  that took her shirt off  in the in the line  which i hear you've had  a little  we had a lot of fun  with it  did that shock you  you know what it was  we were outside  and if you've seen the  8 30 in the show  every morning  the camera pans  the crowd outside  and and what i do  is since i can't see  where the camera is  sometimes i look at  the monitor  and i'm standing there  it happened to be  with ann curry  katie was in  philadelphia the time  and i'm looking at  the monitor  and i see the people  go by and normally  you know hi mom 
[00:24:30]  hey kansas  go jayhawks  and all of a sudden  the camera goes by  and this woman looks  and my first thought  was it was one of  those kind of like  plastic pieces  that you wear on  halloween you know  that they weren't real  they might have been  yeah when you think  about it  and then after like  45 seconds of  staring at it  i said you know  those are real  and you know  she had written  the word wow  on her stomach  which apparently is  you know w-o-w  stands for the  stupid radio station  promotion in new york  called whip them out  wednesdays  and so she whipped

[00:30:00]  yeah they look good  very nice  but you were gonna say it  i was  yeah  about the pinnacle  oh the uh  the pinnacle meeting  was a little longer  than usual  took a little long  it was ticking right up  to uh  like uh  ten to three  or a quarter to three  like oh  then you get back down  to the office  and it's done  gotta get on the air  i don't know  who's scheduling  these things  and then ken's chasing us  with the big pen  with the big contract pen  the ken pen  look at him sweating  he's right outside 
[00:30:30]  the studio  we have a radio show  to do  jim's making faces  at him  jim  i gotta get money  out of him for you  so just relax  ken can stand there  with his fine pen  as long as he feels  necessary  right  you got that right  creepy child molester  looking weirdo  oh my god  that's our boss  and he's not a child  molester  because he's having  an affair with  the lovely melissa  from chile 
[00:31:00]  we know for a fact  that there's some  something going on  and melissa  has been missing  what  can you say  chandra levy  no  really  melissa has been  mia for a couple  weeks  and ken just like  that bastard  senator there  i love him  he's  you love him  classic  condit  yes  yes i do  the guy that ken's  laughing just like him  well let's let's think  about it  we break the news  on the air that  there is indeed 
[00:31:30]  an affair going on  with ken stevens  and melissa from philly  next thing you know  melissa's gone  and is ken now  spreading rumors  that she's loose  just like condit  what a prick  this guy is man  and then they showed  him at uh  some function  last night  on the news  and he's laughing  he's up there  and there  some of his uh  uh  i don't know  the other guys  that are with him  there are talking  about um  how there's so many  press people outside 
[00:32:00]  and uh  he starts laughing  this son of a bitch  there's some girl  missing  probably dead  i don't know  if he's uh  laughing all the time  or or if that's  his facelift  no  maybe that's it  i think his  his skin was stretched  so tightly  that he just has  a smile all the time  he's like this  like it's hard for him  to just pull his mouth  down and not smile  so occasionally  it just goes  baring  yeah i don't know  what about this girl  she's dead  she's only  she was only  she's a hot girl  and she's banging  this awful wrinkled  hold on time out 
[00:32:30]  i don't find her hot  everyone describes her  as hot  this girl is not hot  for him she is  i don't find her hot  she had those big  like um  those jewish chick boobs  you know  what  she's jewish  you ever see those girls  like the real  like jewish  they got the big cans  nice right  nice  you're stereotyping  i know i am  i saw some jewish girls  on the street today  that had the tiny little  banana boobs  i know i'm talking about  the stereotypes  you get a girl 
[00:33:00]  like this  and then uh  he was sleeping  with her  and then she disappears  and she doesn't  call her parents  or anything  which just leaves  me to believe  she's dead  oh she's obviously  dead  but that's nice  the big cans  but as far as  being really hot  or something  no  well she's  a decent looking  girl  and he's  an awful looking  man  the point i'm  making is  that she was  only banging  him because  of who he is  so she wasn't  a great girl  she's just  banging him  to get farther  along in her  business  so she got  far along  exactly 
[00:33:30]  tripped to the dumpster  right up to death  goodbye  so hopefully  melissa will turn up  yeah  or maybe she went  to spain or something  ah  why is ken walking  back down the hall  with his big pen  to stab you  in the throat  all right  want to get into  the fox piece  anthony  all right  let's see  what this is  all about  all right  if you're just  tuning in  the 10 o'clock  news that aired  about 2.40

[00:44:00]  or a picture  I mean we love it  they say  their audience  what are you saying there  are you saying  you're a celebrity  no no no  but  that's what he was saying  didn't it come across like that  you know  certain icons  really don't like  to be bothered  you know  when you're a legend  you know  Opie  you know what though  I was walking down  the sidewalk  with Ben  getting lunch  strutting  like in Saturday Night  just like we did  in the beginning  of the piece  and you know  one of our

[00:45:00]  they say their audience  is one big reason  they're so successful  but we think  the naked ladies  have a little something  to do with it  either way  they don't take their  success for granted  as long as I can remember  I want to do this  sure  I used to sit in my room  with a little radio  listen to Casey Kasem  and people like  you know  people like that  and go with me  someday I'd like to have  my own radio show  those dreams  paid off  but before they made it  Anthony was in construction  and Opie worked  at a Long Island radio station  then the two met

[00:48:00]  on the floor  and your face  completely  you know  covered by a big  white egg  yeah  and the other clips  they show them  in the background  just blinking rapidly  and looking lonely  both grew up  on Long Island  and say they've  pretty much been  doing this show  their whole lives  only now  they get paid  we decided  we were gonna  come in here  do our show  the way we've  always done it  and make some noise  for ourselves  and it attracts  attention  and once you get 
[00:48:30]  people listening  then they realize  you're giving them  some entertainment  some fun  on the drive home  and they stick with you  Opie spilled his guts  in an interview today  what did I do?  well you had to bring up  back in school  I don't even know  how this came up  you heard it here first  back in school  you heard it here first  here's the shocking part  you heard it here first  an exclusive  back in school  Opie would pull  some pretty disgusting stunts  always looking for  the cheap laugh 
[00:49:00]  I used to eat  like gum  from underneath  the desk  for money and stuff  you know  what you should have  done  you should have  told them  about that time  you talked  at a turn  pipe down  over there  pipe down  did my homework  in two different colors  pipe down  now now  you heard it  here first  chewing used  gum  so how do 
[00:49:30]  their families  react to their  raunchy  sometimes vulgar  show  oh god  oh man  guess who's  not wearing  underwear  there's a couple  of times  I go over  for holidays  and go  I had to  turn it off  I had to  turn it off  okay mom  you're not in  the demo  I understand  it gets to be  kind of a pain  you know  you go home  and you get  yelled at a little  bit  because you're  gawking at girls  many have  compared the duo  to another  infamous radio  personality  they say  there's no  comparison  they're talking  about Howard Stern 
[00:50:00]  but there was a time  when they were  banned from  the line that  was said  800 times  last night  completely out  of context  whatever  I'm not gonna  we said a lot  of cool things  and that's what  they decided  to use  over and over  again during  the Yankee game  as he and I  are calling each  other like  oh my god  what did we say  what did we say  oh no  company's gonna  be pissed again  what did we say  what did we say  even saying his name  because of past  on-air battles  Ant and I  are vicious  when it comes to  you know 
[00:50:30]  competing in this  business  and we're really  good at fighting  back and when  they took that  away from us  we felt like  you know  cats being thrown  outside without  their claws  you're not gonna  be fighting back  too well  are you  Howard, Opie  and Anthony  all work for  the same parent  company  but now the  guys have signed  a new deal  and they're free  to talk about  Howard anytime  they want  we don't need  to go on the air  and talk about  Howard  but if he's  hinting to  you know  what he's been 
[00:51:00]  saying for years  if somebody gets  on the radio  and becomes popular  that they're  ripping him off  we want to be able  to respond to that  and that's all  some critics say  the hit show  is sexist  and racist  the guys call it  an antidote  to political  correctness  in the proper  context of comedy  anything goes  sex  race  disaster  don't put  jackasses  on the radio  talking  I want to  hear the music  man  alright  they can  chuckle  because Opie 
[00:51:30]  and Anthony  really do  have the last  laugh  you will grow  to adore us  that's right  just give us  time  now if you  want to give  them some  of your time  you can catch  Opie and Anthony  every weekday  afternoon from  3 to 7pm  on WNEW-FM  radio  back to you  John  alright  thanks  Patricia  yeah  I was waiting  I love that  John Rowland  I'm just waiting  for them to come  back  because if you  remember in the  past when we  did news things  like up in  Boston  they would come 
[00:52:00]  back  they did a  whole story  on WOW  up in  Boston  and just  trashed us  that this is  the most awful  thing in the  world  they come back  to the reporters  they're looking  at the monitor  and he turns  looks right  into the camera  and just goes  their parents  must be proud  and we're like  what  he's editorializing  this prick  their parents  must be proud  John Rowland  is just like  okay  20 minutes  he's like  we just wasted  6 minutes  on fat  who cares  what he thinks  he's a fat  drunk  Evan

[01:31:00]  I haven't talked to him in a few years.  No, actually, he called the show, right?  Yeah.  About three or four months ago?  There he is.  Nice.  Johnny.  Johnny B. from the Jerky Boys.  Do you know all the players?  That's Jim Norton to your right.  Hi, Jim.  How you doing, buddy?  Hey, volume should be down there somewhere.  Here we go.  Johnny from the Jerky Boys.  Isn't this nice in here, right?  You like this, right?  This is good, right? 
[01:31:30]  Beautiful.  Hey, we should talk about the man boob thing.  Oh, what?  We're having a man boob contest, Johnny.  Oh, yeah?  We're giving away a free procedure.  Some guy's going to get rid of his man boobs.  I just tell you because it seems like something that you could, like, you know, make a prank call about.  Oh, yeah.  Don't you hate that?  Oh, my God.  How many times have you got that?  Dude, I got a great idea.  Right.  You got to, like, call my buddy.  Yeah, sure.  The best is when I'm, like, doing a sign or something, and someone will come up to me and say,  did you call my sister last night? 
[01:32:00]  No, it was you, man.  No one does that voice.  It was you.  Unbelievable.  Do your family and friends make you, like, call their answering machines and stuff, though?  You know, it's hard enough for me to, you know, just get down and put a CD together.  Yeah.  I don't like the telephone much, you know?  I guess not.  No.  Oh, look at that.  Ben just popped it.  Is that the one that was in the fridge?  You all right?  Yeah, we just popped a bottle of, uh...  Oh, man.  It's all right.  You drank there, Johnny?  Pardon?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Did you like the Dom a little bit, or, uh... 
[01:32:30]  Fantastic.  You know...  And then we'll get some beers in here?  It's pretty funny that this is happening now.  When I was supposed to come on a few weeks back, it was a little mix-up happening.  Oh, what happened?  I don't know.  That's when you guys, I guess...  Oh, we...  Oh, yeah, we left.  We were done working here.  We didn't have a contract, and we didn't know what was going on, so we just kind of left  for a while.  That was scary.  And now Ken's running around with his big, giant pen, but now he told us to get our contracts.  Yeah.  We have them, but now he disappeared.  He disappeared, and now we have to talk to Johnny B, so he's out again. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  Did you sign yet, or...?  No.  No.  Haven't signed yet.  We haven't signed a contract in a...  It's been quite a while since we signed a contract.  Right.  It's working without a net.  We're working on a handshake, is what it is.  Well, your partner's on the line.  Yeah, we knew this would happen.  Ah, let me try some of this.  Thank you.  Good.  Cheers.  It's cold enough.  Congratulations.  It's all right.  Thank you, Johnny B.  Well, a lot of people want to know what happened to the Jerky Boys.  Well, you guys always, you know, with a team, you know. 
[01:33:30]  Actually, the Jerky Boys was always the characters, and that's what, you know, it was an unfortunate  Hollywood twist there with the movie.  The movie, yes.  I liked the movie, too.  The movie's great.  Yeah.  It still kicks ass, but what happened was the Jerky Boys characters, that's what we're talking  about, it was always Frank Rizzo and, you know, Sal and all the guys, and that was the Jerky  Boys.  Oh.  And, you know, with the Hollywood thing, it's like, you know, hey, you know, one guy, we  got the Jerky Boys right here, let's make, you know.  Who the hell decided to make that a movie?  Like, you put out prank phone call tapes, and all of a sudden you got a movie deal. 
[01:34:00]  Pretty wild, man.  But, you know, when you have characters like that, it's just fantastic, you know.  I mean, worldwide, you know, it's just amazing how this thing has grown.  Yeah.  You got another one out now, right?  Yeah, the Jerky Tapes.  It's out right now, man, and it's kicking.  Yeah, we want to...  You said you like the Silverman cut, right?  Yeah, the stuff with the...  I guess you put a number out there.  Right.  And had people call you.  Right, Silverman.  You know, Frank Rizzo is playing this guy, Silverman, like a sports agent. 
[01:34:30]  And put out the ad and said, you know, if you want to...  I can put you in an IndyCar inside of a week.  I could play...  I'll have you on your favorite Major League Baseball team in a week.  And people actually thought this could happen.  Oh, yeah.  I got calls like you couldn't believe it.  It's fantastic.  And we want to play...  We're just cleaning it up for the radio, Rick?  Yep.  Is it almost done?  It's almost done.  Yeah.  Because Johnny's got potty mouth.  Yeah.  You got the potty mouth on your calls, Johnny.  Well, you know, some of the characters, it's very colorful stuff, you know.  I love when you're current. 
[01:35:00]  I love that.  In the Frank Rizzo voice.  Come on.  What are we going to do with Kamal?  Kamal keeps calling.  Yeah, he's...  What does Kamal want?  Kamal.  Kamal.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Johnny doesn't want to talk to you.  Well, guess what?  What?  You guys always paint him out as the messiah over there.  I got crazy Joe Rendon on the line with me.  He's the guy that put out our first record.  Why are you guys fighting?  Joe, why don't you explain to these people?  Kamal, the guy, he's working, he's doing his stuff. 
[01:35:30]  Yes, Johnny?  Yeah, he's just...  I don't even get into it, man.  It's four years past for me, man.  Four years ago.  These guys don't talk anymore.  No, I know.  Like I said, for me...  Kamal is really obsessed with you because he calls our show all the time.  He calls up all the time.  Right, I mean, you know, whatever.  It's just what it is, man.  But it's such old news.  I've got so much stuff I'm doing.  Kamal.  Kamal.  Yeah.  Johnny doesn't want to talk to you.  See, he's scared.  I got Joe Rendon on the phone.  No?  He's asking for a talk to me.  Why don't you speak to Joe Rendon? 
[01:36:00]  What?  What is Joe...  I don't even know what this is about.  He put out our first record.  He knows John.  Joe, speak.  He put out the record.  Just forget about it.  What are they trying to get at?  I mean, it's ridiculous.  It's like...  I don't want to waste time on that, man.  Yeah, I mean, what...  What is it?  I don't understand why he doesn't just go out and do whatever he wants to do.  And leave you to do what you do.  Kamal.  I haven't talked to him in about five years.  Kamal.  Yeah.  Why don't you, like, just go get a life and leave Johnny alone? 
[01:36:30]  Johnny's working.  Be sure.  That album is...  Doing voices now, too.  Cartoons, huh?  It's pretty well.  Yeah.  Working on Family Guy.  Yeah.  Do a lot of characters on Family Guy.  And, you know, a lot of commercial work.  And just, you know, keeping busy, man.  It's all about the characters, you know?  Yeah.  Driving forward.  That's it.  You don't have to deal...  Oh, you're an instigator, man.  Come on.  Yeah.  Johnny doesn't need to talk to you.  Yeah.  I haven't seen or heard hair of the guy in, Jesus, three, four years now. 
[01:37:00]  You know what it is, though?  When you're hooked up with somebody and you get that popular, people assume that, you know,  you just have this lifelong relationship that goes on.  Like I was saying, I'm stuck with Opie now.  And, you know, that isn't always a pretty thing.  Hey, this is no picnic.  Trust me.  What are you going to do, you know?  Wait till we start fighting.  It's going to get great.  Oh, come on.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Listen, I live on Fresh Palm Road. 
[01:37:30]  Johnny probably knows that's where they filmed the Jerky Boys.  And they were fighting on the set, man.  They were going at it.  Were you really?  Yes.  Come on.  Why would I lie about it?  Ask him.  He'll tell you the truth.  Hey, look, I have no problem with the truth.  You know, we have a few fistfights here and there.  They do, yeah.  I wouldn't want to get in a fistfight with you, man.  You work out and stuff.  Well, you know, it's not about that.  I'm not into that, you know?  Yeah.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  It's, you know, it's part of the deal.  Just want to have some fun, make a living.  You know, you get liquored up and then you get into a brawl.  Nice. 
[01:38:00]  He's too scared to take the call.  Come on.  He's too scared to talk to Joe.  Come on.  Why are you still on the phone?  I don't want to speak to you guys.  I want you to speak.  You're terrible.  I don't know.  This is bad.  Ophie's the worst, man.  Oh, Christ.  He's the best.  What the hell are you doing?  Unbelievable.  Stop that.  We had him on the show.  We tortured him, man.  Why are you hanging up on me?  He called the show back 12 times at least and we're like, hey, we really love the Frank 
[01:38:30]  Rizzo.  Can you do the Frank Rizzo?  That's the other guy.  Frank Rizzo.  It's horrible, man.  You know, a lot of people kind of remember the camaraderie, I guess.  And it's, you know, and it's been, like you said, four years.  Again, I think it all gets back to that movie deal.  You know, you see, you know, the whole up on screen, you know, like two Pillsbury boys.  All of a sudden you're Martin and Lewis, you know, in the movie.  Right.  He got to work with Ozzy.  Yeah, Ozzy was great, man. 
[01:39:00]  Nice.  It was, this guy was a pisser, you know.  Wasn't Big Pussy in that movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Big Pussy was in the Jerky Boys movie.  And now Big Pussy's on the phone over here.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to ask Johnny, what are you planning to do in the future, man?  Are you coming out with another CD or what?  Yeah, it's out right now.  That's why I'm here promoting the CD.  I got a website, laugh.com, that put together with George Carlin and Milton Berle and a lot  of great comedians and whatnot. 
[01:39:30]  All right, man.  That's pretty cool.  I just want to tell you, I think you're friggin' hilarious.  Thanks.  That number four CD that came out, number three was kind of a spanker, man, but number four  was hysterical.  Well, I appreciate that, but number three, man, was my personal favorite.  Really?  Which one was number three?  Describe the cover.  Frank Rizzo on the cover, like King Kong, hanging off the Empire State building.  That's when we introduced, there was five new characters on that CD.  That's like my homies and my cronies.  Yeah, that was a great CD. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, no.  Number four was much better, man.  I split my side laughing.  Well, let's see.  Everybody's got their favorite, man.  You know, some people love number one, number four, whatever, but they're all really good  to me.  I can listen to number one tomorrow and still just lose it.  And every single track.  And some of the tracks that were on the bootleg that, you know, was being passed around for  years.  And that's something that people really, I don't think, really know about.  Because when I first heard you guys, it was on a cassette tape that was overdubbed 50  times.  You could barely make out what it was saying.  And everyone had a story about how, no, this is my uncle's friend's brother's friend that 
[01:40:30]  does this.  And you're like, what?  And some of the stuff, I know why also some of the stuff a little too raw to even put on  a CD.  Well, that's when I kind of came out of the woodwork.  I mean, I was hearing it on radio stations and radio shows, and I'm talking big shows.  Yeah.  And nobody, they were like, we don't know who this is, but man, this stuff is unbelievable.  That's when I said, I got to, you know, I got to definitely come out of the woodwork  and, you know, do something about it.  And it's just, it's been amazing, you know?  Yeah.  It was done, you know, as a family thing with just wacky characters that I was doing since 
[01:41:00]  I was a kid.  And, you know, next thing, when it hit the streets, I mean, you go around the world, wherever  they speak English, this thing is going nuts.  It's Ireland, England, I mean, Australia, Canada, wherever the hell they're, you know.  And then people that are, unfortunately enough, named Frank Rizzo.  Oh, there's plenty of that.  Yeah, there's a lot of, I know, Frank Rizzo.  Frank Rizzo, I heard the guy was a real, real tough guy, too.  Yeah, yeah.  In his tuxedo, he went down with a stick at some riot and started beating people down.  Tough guy.  Tough guy.  Break your ass over there. 
[01:41:30]  What's it?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Finally a jerky boy that we can finally talk to.  I hate that jerk off Kamal.  Hey, Frank Rizzo.  What's up?  Hey, why don't you guys do a bit with Opie and Anthony?  Do a couple little pranks while you're there.  I'm making a Christmas album, actually.  That would be a good idea to get a couple of voices down.  We kind of did a few pranks ourselves.  Hey.  We did okay.  Who doesn't love doing the prank phone calls?  It'll even be better now because you've got Frank Rizzo there.  Brings you right back to when you were a kid.  You've got to wrap your head with a ratchet. 
[01:42:00]  That's right there, butter boots.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah, the one with the tools, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Just the class.  You have your classics.  Like the Beatles have their classics.  That one is just...  And you don't have to say the dirty words.  Like, you can just say, should I bring my toolbox?  Yeah, that does it right there.  He's talking.  Should I bring my toolbox?  I'll see an MR with my tools.  Check it.  Frank.  Check it.  What's up, Frank?  I crossed the way.  Hey, John.  Hello. 
[01:42:30]  John, you remember the twins, Allen and Rudy?  Yeah.  They were the guys that helped you out with the whole Frank Rizzo character, right?  Frank Rizzo.  Yeah, actually, Frank Rizzo is the mayor of Philadelphia.  Rudy Allen had good buddies of mine, yeah.  And I actually knew, yeah, there was a guy, Frank Rizzo, that hung out with us.  Yeah, and they told me the story about how Kamal came in secondary  because there was your other partner back in high school that you guys ended up splitting up with.  The guy Tony, I think it was.  Yeah, Tony.  He's a good buddy of mine, Tony. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, no, they were...  Rudy and Allen say hi to you.  And if you want, I'll give you a number off the phone.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  If you do that with this...  Rudy, all right?  Do that for me.  Leave the number and I'll call the guys.  All right, definitely.  Thanks very much, man.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it.  All right.  Yeah, you get back home and visit, stuff like that,  because I know where you go out to L.A. to do the voices for cartoons.  Yeah, you know what?  I've got to get out there.  You know, I'm kind of getting a lot of flack because that's really where all the work is at.  And there's so many different characters and just, you know, different ranges, 
[01:43:30]  and it's just a blast, you know, doing that stuff.  And his characters that I develop now, it's 20 years, you know, over 20 years of these characters.  And that's why Frank Rizzo, he's got his own personality, you know?  Sol and all the guys.  Sol.  I mean, it's just endless.  I mean, Lee Jeans, they come to me and they want me to create three new characters for them.  And, you know, thank God, boom, just knock them out.  And thank God, it's been great.  Tom, what's going on?  Tommy.  Tom.  Yeah?  You're on the radio. 
[01:44:00]  Let's go.  Yeah, my phone's crapping out on me.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we're hanging with Johnny B from the Jerky Boys.  What's up, guys?  I just want to ask, because I'm a big Jerky Boys fan.  Do you have to get, in other words, can you do a call, like, especially when you put it on your album?  Do you actually have to get permission from the people that you call to put it on the album?  Yeah.  So my question is, if you have that you weren't able to put out because you didn't get, you must have a whole slew of stuff that you weren't able to put on an album.  Actually, I have a few calls that weren't, wasn't able to put on an album. 
[01:44:30]  But there's not that many.  There's maybe 20, maybe 15 calls.  Is there one call you just wish you could get out there, but they never gave the permission?  Well, actually, you know, I'm making a tape for you guys of these calls that are not, you know, we can't release them.  Right.  But they just might end up on the radio.  They're fantastic, though.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's a good question.  Do you ever have anybody, this is something I've always wanted to know, because I remember on one, one guy was really displeased with your call.  Right.  Approach you since you hit Bing, that was the guy that called me. 
[01:45:00]  Well, a couple of times people come forward, but, you know, a lot of times it's fake.  They're not really the people.  Right.  They're just trying to get a few bucks out of the deal.  And, you know, you also have to prove damages.  You know, you can't just, you know, say, how did I hurt you, you know?  Yeah.  And, you know, we just roll with the punches.  But it's been fantastic.  After all these albums, I mean, there's never been a problem.  I remember the one call, though, that guy you called, the bouncer.  I'm going to come down there and shoot you.  Right.  That's, again, something that couldn't come out.  Right, right.  I remember that from the book.  That was a little rough.  Three of you, three C-rags from your place scratched my car. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Hey, we cleaned up this one bit for the radio.  Cool.  Now, what's the name of the CD again, Johnny?  The Jerky Tapes.  Jerky Tapes.  It's out now.  It's out now in all record stores.  Or you can check out laugh.com.  You can get it through laugh.com.  But, you know, it's easy just to grab it at the record store.  And the setup on this, once again?  Is this Silverman?  Yeah.  All right, yeah, this is the Frank Rizzo doing Silverman sports agent who says that he can put these people on your favorite Major League Baseball team, football team, or put you in an Indy car, whatever you want, inside of a week. 
[01:46:00]  That makes jackasses believe it.  Cool.  Let's go to the tank.  Hello?  Hey, do I see a guy there in the Village Boys?  Are you guys offering top-level positions in baseball?  First of all, you do me a favor.  Shut those f***ing bastards up behind you.  Oh, I'm not working right now.  My boss doesn't know I'm calling because this job is a piece of s***.  I'm looking for real work.  Yeah, real work, like in the Major Leagues. 
[01:46:30]  Not, I don't know if I'm ready for Major Leagues, but I'm definitely ready for the Minor Leagues.  No, no, no, we don't do Minor Leagues, son.  I'm a top agent.  My name is Silverman.  Shut that f*** up so I can hear you.  You don't hear me?  No, that f***.  Who is that guy with the mouth?  I'm a salesman.  Well, who's the big mouth behind you?  Oh, he's another salesman.  Put him on the f***ing phone.  He's taking care of a customer.  All right, well, you tell him to shut his f***ing mouth.  I don't need to hear that f*** when I'm trying to talk to you.  Okay.  Now, what do you want to do?  You want to race a car, you want to play baseball, what the f*** do you want?  I want to play baseball.  All right, for what team? 
[01:47:00]  Hopefully, Yankees.  All right, I'm writing all this f*** down.  Give me your name.  My name is Chris.  Yeah, that's great, Chris.  Chris what?  F***ing.  All right, f***ing, right?  Yes.  All right, so what do you want to do?  I want to play the outfield.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Speedy Gonzalez over here.  I need your f***ing phone number.  212?  Yeah.  F*** up.  Right.  F***ing.  Then what is that supposed to mean?  Huh?  That's my number.  Yeah, but no, I don't give a f*** about the number.  You just said you wanted to do what in the outfield?  I want to play the outfield.  Yeah, so do I.  I want to play the outfield.  You've got to tell me more.  I've got to get you out there. 
[01:47:30]  I want to make top dollar for you.  You know why?  I run the 40 in 4.4.  Yeah, so do I.  Let me tell you something.  Why is that?  I'll tell you what.  What?  I've got to make top dollar for you so I can get paid.  Okay.  All right.  Now, what team did you say you wanted to play for?  Yankees.  All right, the Yankees.  We've got a couple of slots in the Yankees.  What do you want, shortstop or second base?  I don't play the infield.  I play the outfield.  Yeah, well, listen.  You don't have many choices here.  I'm trying to make you millions of fans in the 80s. 
[01:48:00]  Nobody gave a f*** about the outfield.  You understand what I'm saying?  I understand.  Move yourself up there where the f*** cameras can get on you.  In the outfield, you get hit with bottles, knives, and all kinds of f***.  You get up there, you play the infield like a man.  You take a line drive to the f*** like a f*** man.  Do you think I can make it like Derek Jeter?  Derek Jeter's a f*** punk.  What do you mean, Derek Jeter?  You want me to bump the f*** for you?  I would love that.  Go ahead, shoot.  So when can I set up an interview? 
[01:48:30]  Look, are you serious about playing ball?  I'm very serious.  Well, first of all, did you ever play ball?  I played high school and college.  You played college ball?  Yeah.  What college?  Florida State.  They sucked?  Not the years I was there.  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, you sound like a little Froot Loop to me.  That's what you sound like.  How much do you weigh?  190.  190.  How tall are you?  Six foot.  Six foot, 190.  That's a little squarmy, don't you think?  My arms are pretty big.  Yeah, your arms are big.  What the f*** are your arms? 
[01:49:00]  My c*** is big.  What's that going to do for me?  Is there something wrong with you?  No, there's nothing wrong with me.  All right.  Let's see.  I'm going to try to think where I can fit you.  Uh, you wouldn't mind being a bad boy for a couple of weeks, right?  A bad boy?  For a few weeks.  Where?  The f***ing Yankees.  No, I don't want to be a bad boy.  Well, that's how we move him up.  We get him on the field there, you know, we break him in slow, and then we move him right  into the dugout.  That's not your plan.  I mean, you're the one that owes us better than me, so... 
[01:49:30]  Well, listen to me.  Okay.  You know, you just brought up Derek Jeter.  Who the f*** do you think put him on the Yankees?  I have no idea.  Silverman, baby.  Me.  Yeah?  Okay.  Now, there's another way that we can go another route, too.  I'll get you an even quicker.  How?  I saw at the end of the week there, you're selling peanuts.  Up in the crowd?  I have to sell peanuts?  Well, you don't have to sell them.  I'm just telling you, fast around.  I'll get you up there selling the f***ing peanuts.  Next thing you know, I got you on the field with the f***ing bats.  Next thing, I'll get you in the dugout sitting with the guys. 
[01:50:00]  And when I'm sitting with the guys, I get a shot?  You want a shot?  I want a shot.  Well, I'm telling you, I'm going to get you a shot.  Now, let's talk salary.  How much you want?  Starting out, like, hopefully, like 50 grand.  What the f*** is with 50 grand, you a**hole?  I got to make money here.  We're talking millions of dollars.  You're talking 50 grand.  And you go in there with that figure, they left me out of the f***ing ballpark.  I'm going to go in there, I'm going to shoot them a figure for 2 million for you for the  first year.  Okay?  Okay.  And I get 20% of that. 
[01:50:30]  So, when could this start?  All right, look.  What you got to do, you got to prepare yourself a little baseball suit.  The costume?  Okay.  You get yourself a nice little costume, slip it on you, and get on a subway or something  and come over to my place.  Where's your place?  It's over downtown Manhattan.  I want to see you in the costume.  Okay.  When I see you in the costume, I see you doing some moves and swinging around here, you  know, you know how you dust off your f***ing slacks here after you slide home?  You know?  You dust yourself off in front of me, s*** like that.  I got to see how you're going to look on camera.  All right?  That sounds great.  If you look good to me, I got your number here. 
[01:51:00]  I'll call you a f***ing back in a couple of weeks.  I got you in the f***ing dugout.  Wow, that sounds awesome.  All right?  When can I come to your house?  You can come to my house when I f***ing call you when I'm ready.  Oh, are you going to call me?  I'll call you when I'm f***ing ready for you.  Okay.  I got a few people coming down this week.  Look, okay?  Look, I got to get off the f***ing phone.  Are you telling a guy who knows what he's doing?  Yeah, I know what I'm doing.  I'm going to get you on the f***ing Yankees.  That's going to show you how I know what I'm doing.  All right?  You little f***ing don't come up with a mouth cute.  How long do you get a call?  What's that?  When will I get a receiver call?  I'll tell you I'll f***ing call you when I'm ready. 
[01:51:30]  When you get your f***ing ass ready to play ball, son.  I'm always ready.  Yeah, you get ready.  And I remember what I said, keep that f***ing mouth toned down.  All right, punk?  All right, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, come on.  Man, that was great.  That was brutal.  God damn, is that brutal.  Tough man, man.  What a tool.  Sounded like a little Froot Loaf to me.  How much do you want to make?  $50,000.  You're going to laugh me out of that.  $50,000.  $50,000 in play.  That's great.  We're hanging with Johnny B. from the Jerky Boys.  We've got to take a break. 
[01:52:00]  We're doing...  Can they hear us, Rick?  No, they're not on the phone.  But are they from somewhere we're not broadcasting?  No, out of state.  All right, we have a bad guest today, Anthony.  It's not you, Johnny.  From time to time, we book bad guests.  How could they not hear us, though?  Out of state.  Oh, yeah?  What?  Get a pen.  It's got the big pen.  It's got the big...  Anything else I need to do?  That is a giant pen. 
[01:52:30]  Look at how sad it is.  Get the pen.  You look really like...  No, you look like your nerves are about at their end, Ken.  Jeremy thought I was going to...  Ken, why are you so nervous today?  We haven't had a contract for the last two months.  Yeah, why today is it so important we sign this?  Right.  I think...  Because, you know, we read the paper and saw the Rush Limbaugh.  Rush Limbaugh.  Mel was offering $500 million to get Rush.  I mentioned that to some people.  And...  Well, remember, he was talking... 
[01:53:00]  Mel doesn't run just radio anymore.  Right.  So that was probably a multimedia deal.  Oh, a big...  Was he going to be an astronaut, too?  Well...  I mean, $500 million.  That guy's going to be doing more than just radio.  To do this.  We didn't get any TV rights, for example, in your deal.  Yeah.  You would think it'd have to be a little less.  Mm-hmm.  Well, maybe we should get the TV thing.  Besides Uber, huh?  You know, if you had signed for eight years, like you did, you probably could have gotten  that same money.  Eight years. 
[01:53:30]  Please.  Jim, what do you think of our boss holding the four-foot contract signing pen?  You know...  Looks good.  That's a nice pen, man.  Isn't that a nice pen?  Very nice.  Does it write?  And where did you get that from?  Who ripped it off from me?  No?  I actually rented it.  Which will come out of your salaries.  Yeah, I tried to buy it, but they didn't want to part with it.  Ken, you're sweating really bad.  You all right?  I was walking with this stupid pen down the street. 
[01:54:00]  We got a picture of...  Everybody thinks they have to say something funny to a guy walking down the street.  Hey, nice pen, dick.  Hey, man, where do you get the ink for that thing?  Like that.  Out of your back.  You have a four-foot pen in your head.  Yeah, that's a big pen.  We're getting a picture of that.  We're going to put it on the website.  The boss holding the contract signing pen.  I figured this might get you...  It's an attention-getter, yeah.  But why can't we do this tomorrow?  No, it's got to be today.  I'll tell you exactly what's happening. 
[01:54:30]  He's meeting with Mel.  Are you meeting?  Mel wants him to hand him signed contracts today, or else you have to answer to him.  And that's a tough thing to do.  I think you were close.  Oh, really?  If I don't do all of that, then I'll be meeting with Mel.  Oh, okay.  He has to hand these to Fareed.  Well, but I don't want to do it this time.  Well, as you can see, Ken, we're a little busy right now.  I'm talking to Johnny B for the Jerky Boys.  What are you doing?  But I have a big pen.  But this goes to 11. 
[01:55:00]  You know, it's expensive.  I only rented it for a short period of time.  They rent that per hour?  Can I tell you something?  Where the hell did you find the big pen?  Can I tell you something?  They made a guy come over here with me.  He didn't want to let the pen out of his sight.  Where do you rent a giant pen?  Lee's Art Surprise.  I was going to buy a regular pen.  What does it cost to rent a pen?  Johnny's amazed.  This really is our boss, and he's really holding a four-foot pen so we can sign our contracts.  Well, as Lee himself explained to me, he rents anything in his store for 10% of the purchase price. 
[01:55:30]  And how much would it cost to buy that pen?  Well, guess.  I couldn't even hazard a guess.  Well, nor could I.  But it's pretty.  We want to see you write something with that.  Does it work?  He has my personal check for this pen, so I don't want to let it out of my hand.  It doesn't work?  It doesn't work?  Looks like he could stab someone.  That must be expensive if he's really worried about having to pay for it.  Is it over $100? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Is it over $500?  Yeah.  No.  Is that over a $1,000 pen?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It didn't come with any ink.  Are we talking $5,000?  No.  $2,000.  A little more.  A little more.  $2,500 pen.  That's ridiculous.  And you had to give $250 to rent that pen.  You rented that pen for $250?  Yeah.  You know, it's one of those things.  And we go to the ATM to pay a guest prize money? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it kind of got out of hand.  You know, it was hanging up there.  I said, can I borrow the pen?  And the guy that works says, sure, you can borrow the pen.  So then I kind of got attached to it.  I have a feeling.  $250.  Great bit.  Great bit, Ken.  I like it.  I have a feeling if we don't sign these contracts.  He's jumping out that window today.  First, he's bludgeoning us with the giant pen.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I had to get my $2,500.  $2,500 pen.  He made me leave a check, a personal check as a deposit. 
[01:57:00]  For the entire amount.  Yeah.  But you just gave him a free plug for his art store.  Did I?  Oh, I used a different name.  Opie, smash the pen.  Oh, yeah.  Opie, smash the pen, man.  Yeah.  Smash the pen.  No, did I say that was a personal check?  Doug from Springfield.  I don't know what he wants to say, but, Doug, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  How you doing, Ken?  Hey.  There's the big pen smell of Melissa.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Doug.  Wow, Ken.  I had no idea he was going to say that.  What the hell was that?  It's not like we could read what the people want to talk about on this phone screen here. 
[01:57:30]  West Coast Dave saying he never signed a contract from a guy who's sweating and anxious.  That's true.  Doesn't that seem bad?  Why are you sweating and anxious, Ken?  This was not easy to acquire.  Remember, it's heavy.  Feel it.  He's not a...  Oh, something's in the works, and I don't know what it is.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  Yeah, you...  Are they...  You finally got...  Is Infinity Broadcasting going to sign Man Cow to a huge money deal, and you're afraid  that we'll say, you know, F this? 
[01:58:00]  Well, no, you would be going after your agent on that one.  Right?  No, you know, he's got to do his job.  I'm just wondering.  It seems like now tomorrow a shoe will drop, and we'll go, aha!  Ah!  Now we know.  That's why we had a sign.  Oh, I see.  No?  That's a...  You know, I can see why you would think that.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't think so.  Bring that pen over here.  Oh, he's got the mallet.  No.  Dude, break that pen.  No.  It's $2,500 out of Ken's pocket.  What is that for?  For breaking stuff. 
[01:58:30]  That sure would leave a big pocket stain if it exploded.  Right, Ken?  Here, Rick, you can...  Something's up.  Now I'm suspicious.  I know.  Now I'm really suspicious.  All right, I'm putting mine back in the envelope.  Look, I got you a big, giant pen.  You look ridiculous, man.  Yeah, that's a...  By the way, it kind of matches.  I told him 15 minutes.  I know this guy's going to charge me more.  Really?  But it doesn't sign. 
[01:59:00]  How are we going to sign with the big pen?  Well, it's, you know, he said...  You want to attach maybe a pen to it?  Symbolic.  Yeah, we can do that.  All right.  I'm not going to sign my contract with a pen taped to a giant pen.  Jim, what do you think of the big pen?  I think you look good with it.  There you go.  Thank you very much.  You're a buzz, man.  You look terrific.  All right.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Johnny B, just completely amazed at this point.  It's just blowing me away, man.  Let's go to the FU line, and we'll figure out what we're doing next, okay? 
[01:59:30]  Go put the pen in my office.  Yeah, go lock that up.  Valuable pen.  What other fun stuff they got to rent there?  Do they have a big thimble?  He's just leaving.  You know how great it would be if he fell and impaled himself on the pen?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, we'll be back.  The incredible shrinking GM.  The FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, I want to send a big FU out to Eisenhower Park out in Long Island.  Every single day I go jogging out there, man, and every single day I see this one weirdo,  this one pervert, driving around in a silver Malibu, driving around from lot to lot with  a pair of binoculars staring at people.  This guy's a sicko, man.  This guy's a pervert.  So big FU to Eisenhower Park for not doing anything about it.  And hopefully a Nassau County cop will hear this and do something about it.  FU, man.  You sick perv.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Hondo from Northeast Philly. 
[02:00:30]  I want to send an FU out to the Philadelphia Eagles.  And they're telling the taxpayers that they wouldn't do it.  They hit us with a f***ing seat tax for a seat license tax for $2,000 and $3,000.  So f*** you, Philadelphia Eagles.  I hope you'll lose for the next 10 f***ing years.  Next message.  This is a big f*** you to Mandy.  You are the biggest piece of herpes carrying trash I've ever met in my life.  You're never going to f***ing go anywhere and you are the biggest slut loser I've ever met.  End of message. 
[02:01:00]  How old are you?  18.  How old are you?  How old are you?  How old are you?  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Holy ravioli.  Mopey.  And Anthony.  Ah, WWF.  Yes.  Invasion live on pay-per-view.  This Sunday for the first time in history, WWF superstars will stand opposite WCW and ECW  in a battle for sports entertainment supremacy as the World Wrestling Federation presents  Invasion live on pay-per-view.  You know, that's how they say it.  High stakes game made more interesting by the shocking announcement that Shane McMahon 
[02:01:30]  has merged his WCW with ECW, now owned by his sister, the lovely Stephanie McMahon Helmsley  that we all love so much.  Betrayed by his children, Vince McMahon put together Team WWF, led by Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Watch him laugh his way through every little talking monologue he's got to do.  They got the first ever bra and panties tag team match, Trish Stratus and Lita take on  WCW's Tori and Stacey Keebler, whatever the hell her name is.  This is going to be one of the best pay-per-views, I'm telling you, in recent years. 
[02:02:00]  Invasion live this Sunday, 8 p.m. Eastern, 7 Central, presented by PlayStation.  Call your local pay-per-view provider to order, 212-398-2563.  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show, hanging with Johnny B. from the Jerky Boys.  What do you say?  Frank Rezzo.  That's right there, rubber boots. 
[02:02:30]  All right, well, Jim Norton in the studio.  And look who's here.  Ken Stevens.  Ken Stevens.  Ken went to an art supply place and rented a giant pen, O.P., a pen that cost $2,500 for a little bit.  Like a little bit.  That you were doing.  Which was good.  I was surprised I brought it back so quickly.  Oh, you brought it back?  I had to.  And Dan from Hoboken's got a great observation.  It's funny how Ken spent the same amount of money on a giant pen as he did on Psycho Mark's settlement. 
[02:03:00]  It's about right.  Dan from Hoboken.  Actually, I think the pen got more.  The pen got more.  The pen got more.  The picture of Ken with the big contract signing pen is up on the website.  Oh, it is already?  W-N-E-W dot com, yes.  Look how quick that happened.  Hey, I don't remember signing a release or anything.  No, you didn't.  Oops.  So, what do you want to do, Ken?  Well, I guess we have to sign this, huh? 
[02:03:30]  That'd be good.  All right.  Who's first?  Who goes first?  Oh, my arm.  Oh, my arm.  I think it's broke.  Hey.  I think it's broke.  No, no.  You have to get a replacement.  Well, get a pen.  You sure we can't do this tomorrow?  Yeah.  I'm not signing with the piece of crap pen.  Who cares what it is?  I spent all my money on the other.  Can we do it with a highlighter? 
[02:04:00]  You can't do it with a highlighter.  No?  No?  Where's the page?  Look at this thing.  It's like pages.  I didn't even read it, but I guess it's okay.  I do.  Right, Johnny?  That's what you do.  You just sign it.  Yeah, you just sign it.  And then you get your ass in it.  Johnny knows.  I've had it happen.  Sure.  You're not really in anything unless you've been really screwed over bad at least once.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's right.  That was the last contract, so I guess we're fine now. 
[02:04:30]  Hey, what happens if the signee, signee's name is spelled wrong?  Oh, it is?  That's good for me, right?  Good for you.  Good for me, right?  Who's the signee?  I'm the signee.  You'll be the signee.  Oh, I'm the signee.  Sayonara.  My name is spelled wrong about a hundred times in the contract.  Is it?  Good.  You got it out.  O-P-Y?  No, the real name.  They spelled it wrong last night on Fox News, too.  That's right. 
[02:05:00]  Mr. Huggers.  Do you have a pen, Mr. Stevens?  I don't.  I guess we can't sign.  I, again, would look at my agent for that, because I didn't drop that contract.  Hey, you moved a decimal point.  Yeah.  Kidding.  Isn't that funny how that works?  Why was our first contract for this place, like, two pages long, and this one's about 250?  They could screw you better and more pages.  That's how it works.  You see all the things we can get fired for?  I know.  Holy yes. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  That's my favorite page.  I bet.  That's the one he turns to all the time.  He's got it memorized.  Yeah.  On the back of my door.  He's hanging up.  Yeah.  Who's Farid?  Oh, Farid.  That's Farid.  No, I didn't know.  I call him Mr. Suleiman.  Hey, I've got to write a title in here.  Can it be any title?  Well, I hope you got one, and in case you wanted one, we thought we'd leave a blank space. 
[02:06:00]  Can I be a czar?  Sure.  You could be whatever you like.  I want to be one, Anthony.  Das Führer.  That's right, Anthony.  We don't have a pen, can we?  Give me a pen.  I'm going to get a nice pen.  I don't want a nice pen.  Give me a nice pen.  Special pen.  Come on.  Now we're all ready to sign, and now you're not ready.  You're putting it off.  I can't believe this.  No, that's a bad pen.  That's a Sharpie.  Sharpie.  Sharpie's good, right? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I'll put like a...  Wow, Anthony.  Rock on.  Rock on, Opie.  Shut up.  Rock on.  Tim, where's your nice GM pen?  All right, I'm going to go get a nice pen.  Go get your nice GM pen, and we'll be ready and willing and able to sign our contract.  We'll continue with the show, all right?  Before I decide which pen to bring, do I get it back after you sign it?  Sure, yes.  You keep it like a ceremonial contract.  Go get a pen, and we'll sign this.  Clinton's signing a piece of cord or something.  Yeah, you've got to save the pen.  Every time he's putting it back away. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, he puts it back in the envelope.  Makes it that much more inconvenient to take out.  How long is he going to buy this?  We ain't signing this today.  He keeps coming back.  He's been trying for the last four and a half hours, Anthony.  This started at like, what, 1.30 or so.  Hey, our next guest is on the phone, Anthony.  Yes.  Did Rick pick her up for a second?  Of course, yeah.  All right, we're doing bad guests today.  Let's get the... 
[02:07:30]  Anthony, explain bad guests.  Well, we get a lot of people that send us press kits on what they do, whether they have  a book out or an event or something, that would really not fit on this show.  You know, like books on that one, what was the last one we had?  Good girls who want to have bad girls sex or something.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, please.  Right, and then the guy that lived in his car for a while.  Lived in his car.  It's these who cares guests.  And instead of just blowing them off, we figured now we're going to take them and do 
[02:08:00]  a little segment called Bad Guest and F with them really bad.  And hopefully they'll hang up crying and stuff.  But she has no idea.  She thinks this is a legitimate radio program.  Yeah, this is Jackie.  And is Frank Rizzo going to help us today?  Yeah, throw in a little two cents.  You can jump in whenever you want.  I'll throw in some two cents.  Johnny, I didn't ask you.  I asked Frank Rizzo.  Look at you, you tool.  All right, so who is Jackie at?  Jackie Fine heals and ignites relationships, Opie.  For the past 13 years, she's coupled her unique experience with information.  I'm falling asleep already. 
[02:08:30]  She has seminars on sex relationships and making it as far as HBO's Real Sex Series.  Oh.  Hey, I got the bullet points.  Learn how to evaluate and understand your relationships.  Discover new ways to keep the sheets hot.  Uncover the amazing results produced.  Uncover the amazing results products like Viacream can have on female arousal.  Yeah, she's plugging this stuff.  It's called Viacream.  I like the Viagra ripoff first three letters. 
[02:09:00]  And what does it do?  Who created it?  Right, and finally, have your audience's problems solved and questions answered on air.  That's where you help us out, ladies and gentlemen.  Right.  Serious questions only, people.  Yeah, we just want the serious questions for Jackie Fine.  Now, for people in other cities, we have to explain.  New York knows this.  Whenever we ask for serious questions only, please give us only the most inane, stupid, friggin' questions.  Thank you.  All right, and you can call up right now, 866-2774. 
[02:09:30]  Wow.  Jackie Fine.  Let's say hi to Jackie Fine.  We're ready.  Jackie.  Hello.  Jackie Fine.  And Fine you are.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Thank you so much for having me.  You have that sexy voice.  Well, thank you.  Are you a hot mama?  Oh, look at that, Opie.  She's got that laugh going.  I like that.  Are you a hot mama that has a lot of sex?  Uh, yes. 
[02:10:00]  Yes, definitely.  Oh, you're an African princess.  A Nubian princess.  I can tell by the voice you got a little color in you.  How did you tell that, Opie?  Opie likes African women.  Yeah.  Really?  Are you like Cafe Latte or Mickey Rivers Dark?  Well, did you look at the website?  Oh, yes, I did.  Yes.  Yeah, you seem like you might have a big butt, though.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Got one of them big cottage cheese asses on you.  Frank Rizzo's also here in the studio.  He's a guest today.  Hi, Frank.  Yeah, what's up?  What do you say?  Oh, man.  Crazy broad.  All you hear is laughter over here.  We're trying to ask you questions.  Yeah, so, uh, Jackie.  Yes?  What's up, baby?  Well.  All right, so.  Oh, yeah.  What?  I like that.  Look at that.  Huh? 
[02:11:00]  Turn, Jackie, around.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, you're not that high.  How would you guys look?  Are you looking at the webpage?  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Nice.  I like what I see, baby.  You know what?  Hi.  Hey, what's up, man?  I like that.  That was the wrong track.  So, what do you do, Jackie?  Well.  Give us a little insight.  Yeah, you're a relationship specialist?  Exactly.  For the past 13 years, I've worked with the American Institute of Human Abilities.  I'm part of, uh.  Hey, so do I. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, really?  No.  So, you're not?  What?  No.  So, what do you do for them, Jackie?  I educate couples on sex and relationships.  You help them get their F on, right?  Mm-hmm.  How to have a better sex life and a better relationship.  And I'm currently talking about the hottest thing out on the market right now.  And what's that?  Ah, pooha!  No. 
[02:12:00]  No?  Viacream.  Viacream.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Have you guys heard of it?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I like that stuff.  I hear it's something you, like, rub on, uh.  You rub it all over that itchy clam is what she's doing with it.  You know, that's what's going on there.  Well, go ahead.  Is that what you do with it, Jackie?  Jackie Frank Rizzo seems to be familiar with it.  You rub it, um, right?  On the itchy clam.  I don't know if it works, though.  I tried it.  I rubbed it all over my ass.  I got no sensation at all.  Of course.  It's not going to work on you. 
[02:12:30]  It's for women only, don't I?  All right.  So, let's go ahead.  But how does the cream know it's being rubbed on a woman?  Well, you would rub it on your significant other or your wife.  What it is, it's the female version of a Viagra.  In a cream.  In a cream.  And it's all natural.  It's some really incredible stuff.  I got a cream I like to rub on the clam myself.  It comes in my own pump dispenser.  So, Jackie. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  Where do you rub this cream?  On the peach or da's?  You rub it right below the little man in the boat.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Well, what's the little man in the boat?  You don't know what the little man in the boat is?  No.  Do I need to know what the little man in the boat is?  Yes, you do.  In order to know where to rub it, you need to know that.  Is that it?  Yeah, the little love button over there.  I thought I had to go down to the Ashroken ramp on a boat.  Give it a good slap now and then. 
[02:13:30]  Get it all riled up.  Does that seem to work for you, Frank?  Oh, beautiful.  Does the cream work its way through the Napa hair?  Well, you're not going to apply it there.  Oh, no.  Not by the hair.  No.  It has to be very specifically applied.  Yeah, but what if there's so much in the way?  What if it looks like maybe you got, I don't know,  Link from the Mod Squad's head and a leg lock?  You know what I mean?  Well, you probably should get a chainsaw and do something about that.  I really don't know what the little man in the boat thing is.  Is he in the middle of the forest?  Ah! 
[02:14:00]  Stop that.  Stop that.  That place.  All right.  Now we know, see?  We're kind of, we're really not that informed.  I got it.  And it does two major things to a woman.  What does it do?  Let's get ready for the two major things it does, this Viacream.  It causes her to become very lubricated.  Ah.  And causes her to become very aroused. 
[02:14:30]  Viacream was created by a board certified OBGYN, the OBGYN doctor, Dr. Ronald Thompson.  Bingo.  How does a guy know what is going to make a woman feel good?  Well, you know, he had women coming to him complaining daily that, you know, they weren't satisfied with sex.  Maybe she just needs a good pounding by someone that knows how to do it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Hey, Jackie, you're an expert on this stuff.  Yes.  How long do you have to F before you become an expert? 
[02:15:00]  How long do I have to ask?  F.  How many years you got to have, how much F-ing do you have to do?  It's not just about the F-ing.  How many miles of C do you need under your belt before you're an expert?  20, 30 miles?  You need a few years of education and study in the area.  Is it safe to say you've done a lot of F-ing in your life?  Jackie, comment?  No comment. 
[02:15:30]  I do it for the benefits.  No comment.  You guys are bad.  We're bad?  Yeah.  You're talking about rubbing cream all over the happy place.  And you use this product?  Yes, I do.  Matter of fact, I do.  And I walk around with it on daily because I like the way it makes me feel.  You walk around?  Yes. 
[02:16:00]  I use it daily because I like the way that it makes me feel, yes.  Doesn't it make you a little squishy?  No.  And what about when you sit down?  You're not leaving any telltale signs that you were there?  No.  No?  No.  I tell you, you want a real trip, you rub that little man in a boat there with some Bengay.  I'll give you a nice little trip.  You use that on the girls there, Frank?  Yeah, a trip to the moon.  It seems to work wonders.  It's amazing stuff.  Frank likes the Bengay.  Frank Rizzo's quite a romantic, Jackie. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, I can tell.  He's always talking about his sexual conquests on women.  You've got to come up with your own wacky ideas, you know?  Yeah, it sounds like he has skills.  So what does this cream do?  Like the orgasm and that's it?  Well, it was created for the 43% of American women who have problems reaching orgasms.  Oh, frigid bitches.  Or who have never had orgasms.  Hey, Jackie, I've got a serious question. 
[02:17:00]  Do we really have to care if the lady has the orgasm?  Yeah.  Of course.  I've got mine.  You get yours, honey.  Okay?  If you want more of it, then you have to make sure that she's enjoying it, correct?  I don't know.  What does it taste like?  Well, it has an interesting taste.  Interesting?  That doesn't sound good.  Well, no, it's not a bad taste.  Does it taste like a dirty penny?  It's kind of like, it has menthol in it.  Menthol?  So, wait a minute.  You put this on, all of a sudden, I'm not getting my face involved. 
[02:17:30]  No.  I could smoke a cool and get the same effect.  It is edible.  It's all natural.  You can, if you swallow it, it won't hurt.  Hey, Jackie, maybe if the guy had his face there in the first place, you wouldn't need the cream, right?  But everyone knows the black guys don't like to eat the coochie.  I would like to know, is there any...  That's a stereotype.  That is not true.  And that was Rich Voss saying that, and he should be slapped.  Is there an age limit?  Like, if, say, you have, like, maybe a babysitting job or something, and you apply the cream to your ward, would it have an effect? 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  How old?  Well, I know that the oldest woman that we've...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Other directions.  The youngest woman?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, what age would you give this, the age limit?  Physiologically, women change.  Up or down?  The whole age limit.  Give us the whole thing from, you know, like when you buy a little game, it says ages 6 to 15. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, say 2 to 40, would this work?  But how old?  No, typically 18 to whatever, 96, 100.  So you wouldn't recommend this for a real hot 16-year-old?  No, no.  No?  I am not condoning that.  You're not getting me into that, no.  Well, then I'm going to have to cancel my order.  So, uh, what do you want to do?  Like, uh, you want to, like, uh, take questions from our listeners and stuff?  I would love to.  And, you know, the first person who calls in with a question for me, I'll send them one free. 
[02:19:00]  Oh.  For some reason, no one seems to be calling.  Hmm.  Wait a minute.  Can you jazz it up a little bit so maybe we get the phones ringing?  Yeah, give us a little more of, uh, what it's like when you use this cream.  Hey, is it true what they say about the black guys?  What is that?  That they got, uh, you know, the biggies?  Well, it depends on what you call big.  You ever been with a white guy?  Yeah, and she did the same thing, laugh. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  See?  No?  Hey, man.  Hey, beautiful.  You like the, uh, you ever been with a white guy?  No comment.  Really?  Yeah.  I would think a girl that's out going with sex would want to, you know, really, uh, talk.  You're an expert.  I'm assuming you've done it with everybody.  Asians, uh, you know, white guys, black guys.  No, no, no, no, no.  You ever been down with a slope?  Well, I'm with the American Institute of Human Abilities, and we focus on monogamous relationships. 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that's the foundation, I know.  So you're in a monogamous relationship?  Yes.  And is it a white guy?  No.  Oh, look at that.  I like that.  A sister that stays with the brothers.  I like that.  They're all pink on the inside.  I like that.  As another black man, I enjoy that, because I don't like seeing our fine sisters out there  with, uh, with, uh, white guys.  Uh-huh.  All right, well, Jackie, we're going to take a break, because this is going quite well,  and we're going to take calls from our listeners. 
[02:20:30]  You have definitely jazzed up the phones quite a bit.  We've got, uh, about 20 people on hold.  They want to ask relationship questions today.  Good ones, right?  Only serious questions only from our, uh, listeners.  Yeah, no, we fool around a little bit, but serious, uh, questions from the listeners, yes.  Wonderful.  And what effect does this have if you apply it to a hanky and cover a nose?  If you apply it to a hanky and cover your nose?  No, no, like someone else's nose, maybe a close friend, as you would with chloroform. 
[02:21:00]  The menthol might work there, right?  I would think that it wouldn't have an effect, because it only works on the mucus membrane  of a female tissue.  Oh, you make it sound so hot.  Nothing better than a nice big mouthful of mucus, right?  I'll make you flow mucus.  I just wish her picture was as hot as her voice.  Kind of like snot.  Yeah, it is.  It's all the same.  Isn't the mucus inside that area, Jackie, the same as the mucus in your nose?  Yes. 
[02:21:30]  Isn't that disgusting, now that you think about it?  Well, that's what you want, a vag that looks like a third grader's nose.  Blowing snot bubbles.  Frank Grizzo, surprisingly, very quiet right now.  Yeah, this is...  That's a good thing.  All right, Jackie, we're going to put you on hold, and we'll take some questions next, okay?  Sounds good.  It's Viacree, right?  Yes.  Okay.  There you go.  All right, hold on, Jackie.  Jackie Fine, everyone.  Let them hang like the animals they are. 
[02:22:00]  Anthony, brand new sponsor for the O&A show.  We're talking to Jackie Fine and the new sponsor, Lifestyles Condoms.  Lifestyle Condoms, that's right.  Lifestyle Condoms.  Found a new way to make using a condom easier.  They're called Lifestyles Discs.  Looks like a butter pack you get from a diner. 
[02:22:30]  And you just peel back the lid.  They're easy to open, even in the dark.  No more struggling.  Plus, the packaging protects the condom from damage while you're trying to open it.  You know you don't want that happening.  Hey, Jackie.  Yes.  You like the condoms?  Yes.  All right.  You practice that safe sex?  Of course.  All right.  You've got to try Lifestyle Condoms.  They feel good?  Oh, it feels great.  They've got good ones, too.  They've got fun styles, too.  They've got this sensuous vanilla.  Mm-hmm.  Very strawberry.  Or tropical banana. 
[02:23:00]  They're flavored ones.  How about that?  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  It's strawberry.  Do they have the Dirty Penny flavor?  No, you make that yourself.  How about mushroom?  Mushroom, beef, and broccoli.  The original extra-sensitive discs, they're thinner than ordinary condoms for added sensation.  And also try the assorted colors.  They have a lot of different types of condoms.  Go to Lifestyles.com.  Lifestyles.com to check it out. 
[02:23:30]  All Lifestyles condoms lubricated.  Yes.  For a comfortable, natural feeling.  Lifestyles condoms.  Discs.  Easy to open.  And easy to use condom.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Johnny B. from the Jerky Boys hanging with us today.  Yeah.  Also, Frank Rizzo somewhere in the studio. 
[02:24:00]  What's up there, you son of a bitch?  Jim Norton in the studio.  And we're in the middle of talking to Jackie Fine.  Jackie.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, I thought you would have hung up by now.  I don't think so.  Not before taking questions from our audience.  Yeah.  She's like a sexpert, right?  You're an expert?  Yes.  You've done a lot of this effing and you've got some pointers for the folks now, right?  You've studied other people effing.  You ever watch people just have sex? 
[02:24:30]  No.  No?  No.  Everything's still in its proper place on you?  Exactly.  How could you not watch people have sex?  Well, you know, I've watched a lot of porno, but that's not education.  A lot of porno?  That's not education.  Why not?  It certainly is.  I learned some great moves from porno.  I learned a lot of cool tricks.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you can't see what your partner's feeling with your face in the place.  Who cares?  Face in the place?  Face in the place?  And I have to explain that, too, right? 
[02:25:00]  Well, what do you mean you can't see what your partner's doing?  You can't see what she's feeling.  Yeah, you can.  You look up.  Hey, Jackie.  Yes?  Are you into that 69 there?  Am I into the 69?  Yeah.  You like that?  Do I like the position?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love it.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Solid.  Puts your nose right there.  Do you ever do the rusty trombone?  The rusty trombone.  The rusty trombone.  You ever hear of that one?  No. 
[02:25:30]  Is that one that you made up?  No.  People, it's very popular.  I'm surprised.  You being the expert, you don't know what the rusty trombone is.  Jackie, get this.  I'll enlighten you.  I can't believe this.  You're a sex expert, and I have to enlighten you on the rusty trombone.  I know.  Not us.  Isn't that something?  You put the tongue right on the balloon knot.  Now, do you know what I mean by that?  Mm-hmm.  You know what the balloon knot is?  Yes.  Yeah?  You're sure?  Okay, continue.  All right, the balloon knot.  And then as you're working that with the tongue, you'll give the reach around, and now you work that like a trombone. 
[02:26:00]  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Right?  That's called the rusty trombone.  Frank Rizzo loves the rusty trombone.  How great is that?  Oh, boy.  I tell you, I let my dog give it to me all the time.  See?  Right?  You ever do that, Jackie?  No.  Yeah.  You into Cleveland steamers or golden, uh, you know what I mean. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, no.  I can't even say it anymore on this goddamn show.  Jackie, do you get your freak on?  Frank?  Nice.  I thought we were going to take calls.  Jackie, I do want to ask you a very serious question.  What is all this emphasis on condoms?  What is the emphasis on it?  I don't understand it.  Yeah, well, you know.  I feel like the condoms get in the way, you know.  I'm practicing safe sex, you know.  It's overblown.  I mean, what am I going to do, catch AIDS twice? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  No.  Actually, I do not think that it's overblown.  I think that it's very important to protect yourself.  Especially.  I've got a bunch of queers running around.  That doesn't affect the...  Norton doesn't quite understand a lot of things.  I think he's very limited in his thinking.  Yeah, he's a little slow.  I can tell.  That's why we have him on the show.  He's not all there.  Yeah.  You like it in that doom, Pierre?  He sounds like he's two sandwiches short of a picnic, huh?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jackie, be careful.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:27:30]  Jim's reading level's, what, sixth grade, Jim?  No, I read very well.  I read very well.  Yeah?  Jackie.  Yes.  Do you ever, you like the backdoor action?  No.  No?  Mm-mm.  I would think a girl like you now would just be like all, every orifice is fair game.  No?  No.  Do you toss the salad?  Yeah.  Tea bag?  If I told you, I'd have to kill you. 
[02:28:00]  You like the tea bagging?  Do you toss the salad?  Get to the donkey punch?  I thought we were going to take both of you.  All right.  Have you noticed differences in different ethnicities?  And I'm being very, very serious when I ask this.  Norton, yes.  White women and black women react differently.  And Asian women, I find, are the hardest to stimulate.  Really?  And I'm not kidding and being sarcastic, but one time I was laying down with a zipper.  And, um...  Sorry. 
[02:28:30]  She could not turn it on.  Couldn't, wouldn't work.  Maybe the cream would work.  Hmm?  I don't know.  But I'm asking, is that a genetic thing?  Well, they're...  So you think that it was just because of her nationality that she wasn't able to get turned  on?  Yeah, because her, like, equipment is sideways, right?  No, no.  Don't be a goof now.  No, the equipment is, uh...  The equipment is fine and nice, but I honestly have always found that Asian women have had  a tough time being stimulated.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it could be their, uh, belief systems and how they were brought up. 
[02:29:00]  So, you know...  Oh, sneaky.  You know, that is definitely a problem in that area.  Yeah, I guess it's hard to feel good when you're yellow and war-making.  Hey, let's take...  Um...  Some phone calls.  Yeah, Jackie, let's take some phone calls, okay?  Yeah.  We're talking to, uh, Jackie Fine.  Right?  Yeah.  And she is Jackie.  Jackie. 
[02:29:30]  Jackie.  Hey, Chris, you're on with Jackie Fine.  She is Jackie.  Yeah.  Well, Jackie, I was wondering...  Can you hear, um, um, Chris, Jackie?  Chris, hello?  Hello.  Thank you, Chris.  Oh.  No, thank you, Jackie, because I'm really having a problem here.  Hey, Chris, keep it clean for the radio, okay?  So you've got to talk in code.  Okay.  You can't get too clinical.  Okay.  You're very clinical.  I've been with this girl for about, uh, six months now. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, every time, um, we try to have sex, or, um, how can...  Every time...  Wait, hold on, Jackie.  Hold on.  Opie, I don't even think that's a legitimate question.  No, it...  He's saying his girlfriend's junk gets in the way when he tries to have sex with her.  He sounds like a prankster.  I think so.  His girlfriend's...  And I was hoping if the cream would work.  I think...  But I can't find a little man in the woods.  I only, uh...  Hey, darling, if you're a girl... 
[02:30:30]  All right, hold on.  I do believe we've been pranked, Anthony.  Jackie, I apologize.  I think that was a prank call or something.  Yeah, we want to keep it pretty serious, guys.  Serious questions.  We have Jackie Fiennes.  Cheese.  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Hey.  That's the best thing of the day.  Uh, Anthony.  Hey, I just got a quick question for Jackie, and, uh...  I have some relationship problems.  Uh-huh.  Anthony?  I was wondering...  I was wondering if a cream's gonna help me.  Uh, my wife's not into getting mud on the helmet, and I was wondering if that cream's  gonna help. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, good question.  Would the cream help out if a girl's a little shy about putting a little mud on your helmet?  Ann, I was hoping if I could ask another question.  Hold on, let her answer the first question.  You asked one already.  Yes.  Oh, come on.  Uh, she's a little shy about putting mud on the helmet.  Mud on the helmet.  Mud on the helmet.  Is the cream gonna help with that area?  Mm-hmm.  Jackie, you're the expert.  We're all patiently waiting for the answer.  I would say that, no, I mean, you know, it's like, she doesn't want to put mud on your 
[02:31:30]  helmet, and you're wondering if the cream's...  I don't see how that's a match.  Maybe it would, uh, I don't know, loosen it up a little, or, uh, kill the pain.  Because you all know how they scream when you just drive it home.  Hey, man, it was a slip.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  All right, Anthony, I guess the answer is no to your question.  No.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony show.  One question.  And, Jackie, it does have a menthol, uh, taste, you said? 
[02:32:00]  Well, there's two major ingredients in it.  Okay, that's good.  I wanted to know, um, would it possibly...  Yes?  Yes.  Norton?  Jim?  No, you can go.  Jim's having trouble with his question.  Would it possibly, um...  Yes, Jim?  Yes, Jim?  Wait, my microphone's not working.  Yeah, I know.  That's what it is.  Is he having mic problems?  We have technical, uh, glitches sometimes.  Uh, yes, uh, Norton?  Um, well, as Jim, uh, tries to figure out what the F he wants to say, it is menthol, though, 
[02:32:30]  right?  That's one of the major ingredients in it, and the other is L-largening.  Uh, Jim, why don't you just, uh, spit it out there?  Okay, here we go.  I was wondering, if, what does it smell like?  It doesn't have a smell.  Not, well, how can I have a taste if it's not a smell?  Is it menthol-y?  I'm not even goofing with you.  I'm being very, very honest.  No, it doesn't have a smell.  It's an all-natural cream.  Can I have an onion-y reek from my taint?  Excuse me?  Yes.  Uh, Jim, she didn't hear you, so, um... 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  That was a mile ago.  My, um...  Get over here.  Jim, please?  I'm sorry.  Would it remove the onion-y smell?  On- onion?  Onion-y smell?  From- from where?  Oh, goodness.  From my taint.  From- your taint?  Jackie, would it remove the onion-y smell from his taint?  It reeks of onion.  He has an onion-y smell in his taint. 
[02:33:30]  I think that he has a serious problem.  Yeah, and it's for the women, right?  It's got a menthol-y thing, and you rub it on, um, that area, right?  Yes.  So, is it- is it like smoking a coal through a trout?  No.  No?  All right, I'm just trying to get a line on what this might be like.  Why don't we go to the next call here?  All right.  Steve, you're on with Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Hey, Jackie.  Yes?  Yeah, I got a question.  Um, I love my mother in an unnatural sort of way, but she doesn't love me back the same way. 
[02:34:00]  Now, can I give her this cream, and maybe she'll love me the way I want her to love me?  Ooh.  Oh, good question.  Jackie?  You could give it to your mother, but I would strongly suggest that you not love your mother in that way.  But nobody else knows me the same way my mother does,  and she's the only one who's ever loved me for my whole life, and I really want to be with her.  But she doesn't see things the same way that I do.  Well, just try to put the cream on something she's going to use in that area and fool her with it.  How if I just use a baseball bat and knock her unconscious? 
[02:34:30]  See, now I think he's kidding.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  You know, that's not right.  He's just trying to be outrageous, Anthony.  Jackie, I'm looking at your picture right now, and I got to tell you, how was the sticker stop today?  How was the sticker stop?  Yeah, the Wild Sticker stop in Brooklyn.  Never mind.  Let's take another call.  Oh.  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm Jackie Fine.  Yeah.  I'm looking at Jackie Fine, and she sure is Jackie. 
[02:35:00]  If this cream is applied right, will it stop an eight-year-old from testifying?  No.  Man, what kind of expert are you?  Not for eight-year-olds.  Right.  I knew that.  All right, let's go.  Jim Norton's got some issues.  Cosmo.  Hey, yo.  Hey, what do you got?  Yeah, I got a question for this chick over here.  All right.  I have a little problem getting women every now and then.  Basically, I don't know if this cream's going to help.  See, they kind of get mad when I, like, grab them from the street and toss them in my trunk. 
[02:35:30]  If I apply this cream to, you know, intimate of areas, will I get some ass finally?  Hey, that's a good question.  That is, does it work on people that have been apprehended, held against their will, and maybe even, I don't know, sexually assaulted?  If you apply it properly, yes.  I think we, how about that?  Get out the phone, you skank!  Hey, Cosmo.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.  What?  You know, we don't need that.  Why do I have to talk?  Stop it.  My God, Jackie, I got to apologize for some of the calls. 
[02:36:00]  Serious questions only, people.  Kids.  Kids.  Unbelievable.  Hey, um, there's a couple gay guys calling, and they want to know what, you know, what do you got for them?  Uh, nothing.  It doesn't work on the, uh?  No, it doesn't.  No.  Do you have any products for the homosexual community?  No, I don't.  What do you got, what do you, what do you got against the gays?  Well, what kind of bottle does it come in?  Maybe they could use that.  No?  No.  You were in Real Sex?  No.  On HBO?  HBO, yes. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, you were?  Yes.  What'd you do?  Real Sex, that's a wrap.  They filmed one of our seminars.  And what happened at the seminar?  Were there naked people having sex?  No.  Were they using the cream?  No.  I can't get a straight answer out of her.  Jackie, you're not much of an expert.  Well, you're, you know, I really.  I can't get a straight answer.  I'm probing you here for an answer, and I'm not really, I can't get you as being an expert.  You can travel all you want.  I figure, you give me a serious question, I'll give you a straight answer. 
[02:37:00]  Come with an applicator.  Oh, good question.  I'm not joking.  No, it doesn't come with an applicator.  What do you use?  Your finger.  A fist or a hammer claw?  You use your finger.  You use your finger.  Yeah.  All right.  If it was a big gal, maybe a paint roller?  No, no paint roller.  Just a dab would do you.  You don't want to put on too much.  All right.  We're doing pretty well with the questions from the listeners.  A couple idiots out there, but in general, we're doing well.  Scott, you got a question for Jackie Fine? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Hi, Jackie.  How are you?  I'm involved in a monogamous relationship, too, with my parish priest, and I'm trying to  keep it fresh.  I just want to know if I use this cream on its paint.  Scott, you got to clean it up for the radio.  They're dumping out.  Yeah, you can't say what you were doing after you applied your lipstick.  Oh.  Oh.  Just so I think we understand what's going on with the goddamn lipstick, Scott.  Frank Rizzo's getting pissed over here. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, what do you think, Jackie?  No.  No what?  It only works on women.  It doesn't work on men.  So use it on a nun.  Yeah, but he dresses like a nun.  But he doesn't have the parts.  You know, I think, Jackie, I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is another prank.  Oh, good.  All right.  Over and out, charming quotesmith.  You know what, Jackie?  I think you're forgetting, and I don't mean to be critical by no stretch, but aren't some 
[02:38:30]  women traumatized mentally where it's not a physical problem they're having and they  cannot achieve arousal due to, say, some type of a mental trauma?  Yeah, probably from listening to the radio show.  No, no, no.  I mean, all joshing aside.  No, no.  I'm not even teasing.  Jackie made a funny.  But I mean, is that a possibility?  Comment.  I dated a woman, and this is true, who had been raped before we met, and as much as I  would make fun of it and bring it up and tease her.  Yeah, she was probably traumatized even more so because you were teasing her. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, well.  Jackie, you got this cream on you now?  Rub it on.  Come on, put it on that thing.  Looks like a Wally.  Hey, let's go to Diane, who doesn't really understand what we're doing.  Diane, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Is this ONA?  Yeah, we're talking to Jackie Fine.  She certainly is Jackie.  Jackie.  Hey, Jackie, I got a question for you. 
[02:39:30]  First of all, is this the same cream that, I forget who, was talking about it on Oprah  Winfrey?  Yes.  It is.  Yes, on April the 27th, they were talking about it briefly.  Oh.  Three and a half million emails the next day asking where is the cream?  Right, how do you get it?  Yes, exactly.  Really?  Okay, now I have like the first serious question of all these jokes on the air.  Thank you.  Thank God.  Okay, here's my situation.  I married, what, seven and a half years? 
[02:40:00]  I have a four-year-old son.  Mm-hmm.  After we had the baby, because my husband was going to be skank.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  Oh, you can't?  Okay.  But you have to say.  I will explain.  You had a kid four and a half years ago, and now the husband, he doesn't like.  Won't go downtown.  Won't go downtown.  Doesn't go downtown.  That's good.  Well, lose the belly fat.  Have you showered since the birth?  Oh, no.  You know what?  ONA, I almost did your mom's I want to F.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Almost.  Almost. 
[02:40:30]  I wouldn't do it.  Hey, wait.  There's a guy on the line that's going to answer your question.  I smell ramen poontain.  He doesn't like eating the peach anymore.  Anymore.  After you had how many kids?  One.  One kid.  How long ago?  Four years.  So, he doesn't like to do that anymore.  He just says that's where babies come from now.  It's a baby factory.  He's right.  He does.  They keep it all nice and, you know, trimmed up and stuff.  Oh, I do.  I do.  Guys like it like a, you ever see a little cherry stone clam? 
[02:41:00]  Yes.  It's all nice and tightly wrapped and there's nothing there.  They don't want it to look like an explosion at the chopped meat factory.  No.  Doesn't look like that at all.  You know what I mean?  Or that old looking oyster.  I'm 5'3".  I weigh 105 pounds.  The old muscle that opened up and turned black around the edges.  Yeah.  You guys, you guys are mysterious.  It looks like you dropped an old scallop on the barbershop floor.  Right?  Droopy elephant lips.  I don't want that.  Guys don't want to see that. 
[02:41:30]  Well, it doesn't look like that.  It doesn't look like when you're trying to feed a horse a sugar cube.  I'll take a picture and I'll send it to you.  All right.  That thing with its lips.  Hey, look at the time.  We ran out of time.  Jackie Fine.  Oh, damn.  She's Jackie.  Yes.  Jackie.  Jackie.  Thank you so much for helping Diane out.  Where do I get the cream?  She didn't help me.  Who cares?  Jackie, you can get the cream by visiting my website.  Hang the phone up, Drew Skank.  At www.  Shut up.  Hang the phone up, Drew Skank.

You are truly Jackie.  Were you on Oprah?  Jackie, you were on Oprah Winfrey?  No.  Was the cream on Oprah Winfrey?  Yes.  The cream was on Oprah?  Do you know if...  What do they do, just put it on a little nightstand there and you looked at it for a while? 
[02:43:30]  She interviewed the cream.  When she pulled her pants down, did it look like Bubba Smith's mouth?  Hey, Jackie, we ran out of time, unfortunately.  Yeah.  We could do this all day.  Believe me, we could.  I think we did.  Your website is justaskjackie.com.  And if you want the cream, 1-800-848-5928.  Yes.  Right on.  Oh, goodness.  Thank you, Jackie.

Um, well, I learned that Anthony has serious issues with young girls.  Why is that?  Well, okay.  I'm not even sure if it was him that said it, but somebody made a reference earlier  when Jack A. was on about how it would work with a 16-year-old girl.  That was Norton. 
[02:47:30]  That was Norton.  Okay, well, did Norton have serious issues with young girls?  No, no.  Anthony said the 16-year-old, I was implying a toddler.  A toddler?  Yes.  That's even worse, dude.  Of course it is.  That's pretty bad.  That's way bad.  She made a statement.  That's even worse.  Yeah, please.  So tempting, though.  All right, Ann.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Okay, Jerry learned a lot of things, Anthony.  He learned that Ken rents big, giant pens.  He also learned if you're not laughing in 20 minutes, you get a toaster and a rookie card.
