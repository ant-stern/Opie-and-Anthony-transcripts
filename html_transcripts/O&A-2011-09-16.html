<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Larry King's introduction, followed by the hosts discussing bizarre news headlines: a failed murder attempt thwarted by a falling fake beard and a teenager's cancer hoax.  The conversation quickly shifted to the stark contrast between their technologically outdated SiriusXM studio and Anthony's far superior home setup. Opie vehemently criticized SiriusXM's lack of investment in their show, citing outdated equipment, infrequent video uploads (the last being a Steve-O interview from months prior), and a general lack of vision from management, whom he repeatedly called "idiots" and "losers."  He contrasted this with the successful launch of his cousin RJ's sports show, broadcast from Anthony's advanced home studio.  The hosts highlighted the irony of having recently hosted numerous high-profile guests whose appearances could have generated valuable video content, but were squandered due to management's inaction.

The show then transitioned to the upcoming "Bobo dating game," sponsored by Trojan condoms.  Three female contestants were vying for a $1,000 prize.  Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guests Bob Kelly, Jason "Mayhem" Miller, and Tracy Morgan, discussed the selection process and the contestants' appearances with humorous, often crude, commentary. A major point of contention was Trojan's bizarre stipulation that no penises should be visible during the contest, a rule that baffled the hosts, especially given Bobo's involvement and Trojan's product line.  This led to further frustration with management, specifically Gary, for failing to communicate this beforehand.  The hosts also lamented outdated promotional materials and discussed alternative uses for condoms, leading to a humorous bit involving Bobo, flour, and a condom.  The segment also included a discussion about a caller, Cassius, who was listening for free via a loophole, prompting a conversation with Cassius and a staff member, Troy.  A prank call to another radio host was teased for later. Bob Kelly discussed his *Curb Your Enthusiasm* appearance, and Opie shared his struggles with conceiving a child.


The next segment started with a caller recounting faking orgasms to avoid fatherhood. This segued into a discussion about the difficulties of fatherhood, including a miscarriage experienced by a friend, and adopting children, with racially charged preferences expressed by the hosts. The caller then described his experience filming *Curb Your Enthusiasm*,  including interactions with Larry David and Bill Buckner, and the numerous requests to tone down his insults towards Buckner.  The conversation then turned to the unpleasantness of New York City sidewalks and dog waste.

Bob Kelly, Jason "Mayhem" Miller, and possibly Tracy Lords were in studio. Mayhem Millerâ€™s appearance dominated the latter half, covering his MMA career, experiences on *Bully Beatdown*,  upcoming fights, dating preferences, and time in Japan.  Numerous callers phoned in, some with sexually suggestive offers to Miller. The segment was filled with sexually explicit jokes and comments.

A subsequent segment featured Mayhem Miller promoting *The Ultimate Fighter*, followed by Tracy Lords discussing her new single, "Last Drag," her career transition from pornography, and working with John Waters.  The hosts then attempted the "Bobo Rape Contest" dating game segment, featuring Bobo and two women competing for a date and $1,000.  This segment was heavily punctuated by vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments, with significant discussion about Bobo's penis, which the hosts repeatedly pressured him to expose despite Tracy Lords' visible discomfort and objections.  Tracy Lord's song was played, followed by further sexually charged conversation.


The Bobo dating game continued, with Tracy Lords helping to set the stage, highlighting her own attractiveness and Bobo's preferences (including being a New York sports fan).  Two contestants, Courtney and Jackie, were introduced with insulting biographical sketches. The segment featured crude and sexually explicit jokes about Bobo's physique, the contestants' bodies, and sexual acts.  Bobo struggled with interview questions, revealing his insecurities and limited knowledge.  The contestants' answers were interjected with more crude humor.  Bobo ultimately chose Jackie, seemingly for her memorability rather than genuine interest.  The segment ended with sexually explicit commentary, Bobo revealing his insecurities and prejudices, and further discussion of the contestants and the absurdity of the situation.


The final segment heavily featured a listener-submitted photo of Bobo in a supposedly seductive pose. The hosts, co-hosts, and a studio audience member, Courtney, mocked the photo, focusing on Bobo's awkwardness and the unusual angle.  Explicit commentary about Bobo's penis followed, along with numerous crude jokes.  The hosts engaged Bobo in a bizarre reenactment involving a banana as a penis, simulating oral sex.  Further jokes at Bobo's expense ensued, along with discussions of a planned "compound party," a plug for Trojan condoms, and a digression into Bobo's experiences with allegedly aggressive African-American high school peers, including discussions of racial slurs and perceived threatening behavior. The show concluded abruptly, with the hosts expressing exhaustion and disbelief.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show  Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:03:00]  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony Show?  You gotta catch it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah!  This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on there, though.  Yeah, I think a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, or phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disordered.  This show is so disordered.  This show is so disordered.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying it.  Well then, turn off!  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Yes, thank you, Larry.  Yeah, I was, uh, good morning, by the way. 
[00:04:30]  I was just reading the prep sheet.  Yeah.  There's some great stories on here.  They might have been on here a few days, but we've been so busy lately.  Busy bees.  We haven't done a lot of news shit.  But, uh, man attempts to kill his lover's husband.  Lover's husband.  Man's attempt to kill his lover's husband.  Right.  Okay, got it.  All right.  Falls apart after his fake beard falls off.  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  I don't even think we need the story.  That's just funny in its own right.  Headlines sometimes can be funny.  And then, uh, teen fakes cancer and raises $17,000.  Nice.  That's kind of nice.  Until that fucking ironic karma gets you, and you go to the doctor and realize, oh, fuck, I got it.  Is that what happens, you think?  Yeah, I think that happens when people pull that cancer card.  I don't believe in karma, because I, I, because then.  No?  Wouldn't all the shitty people be dead by now? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, but I think it's, uh, more of a suffering thing.  When do you suffer?  It doesn't necessarily strike you dead.  It just, you suffer.  How, though?  Suffer internally.  You suffer mentally.  How?  Socially.  How?  How?  How?  How?  How?  How?  How?  You just, like, after a while, you don't have the human fund.  Well, people.  Give out cards for the human fund.  People try to beat us up about karma.  Yeah.  And I know in my heart, through the years with this radio show, this is what I tell people  to, maybe just to justify it, we've brought more joy into people's lives. 
[00:06:00]  And laughter.  And laughter than some of that weird darkness, heartache shit.  Of course.  Sometimes we sacrifice an individual and we just beat them down to nothing.  But that's for the enjoyment and the laughter for others.  Of so many.  So I'm thinking if you're looking at karma overall, I think we're completely safe, sir.  Right.  I believe this, by the way.  That's exactly it.  This is exactly how I think when I leave this place.  Well, everyone's got to sleep at night. 
[00:06:30]  Well, you know what?  We all have to lay down in that bed.  You stomp on a homeless guy's cake.  Oh, it was a shitty day for that guy.  But how many people actually enjoyed that and laughed at that?  The joy.  Bringing happiness into their miserable lives.  It was everywhere that day.  So I'm thinking we got some great karma.  I think we have a lot of really, really good karma around us.  Totally.  So.  Digging it.  Anyway, how are you, man?  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  So good.  Hey, how about that weather this morning, huh?  Jesus.  Right?  What the fuck?  Get it.  It's cold.  It's 50 already.  Yeah, it got a little chilly overnight.  But it's nothing to talk about.  You're right.  I heard what you just said there.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's going to go up to 67 today, which is a perfect fall day.  And we are technically in fall.  Yeah.  It gives a fuck.  So people get a little shaken up.  You're just going to be bummed because you're going to have to close your pool soon.  Well, that's just the thing.  I'm cranking the heater.  And then after a few months, it becomes what I call a losing battle where I'm looking at 
[00:07:30]  the temperature.  See, I have a little remote control thing.  And I press a button.  And I can see the temperature of the air and the temperature of the water.  And I notice they start, you know, temperature of the air starts going down.  Temperature of the water is trying to hold up, trying to try.  It's like, I can't make it into the 80s anymore.  It's like 79.  Oh.  And then it dips down to like, you know, 75.  And then by that point, it's too cold outside to be in 75 degree water.  You could use the jacuzzi for a while. 
[00:08:00]  But then after a while, I got to call up the people and say, hey, wrap it up.  Time to shut her down.  Time to shut her down.  Well, I get to swim all year long because I got a nice huge pool in my building.  What?  I got to deal with the common folk, but I get to swim all year long.  That sucks.  You know, every once in a while, you got a baby in there that shits and stuff.  But, you know, besides that.  Well, that's disgusting.  Besides that.  Shut that shit down.  It's a nice little lap pool.  Yeah.  I had my cousin over last night and one of his friends. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And they did a sports show from the Compound Studios.  How did that go?  Oh, you know how the listeners and viewers are.  I forewarned him.  But he's quite the smart ass.  So he can handle it.  Yeah.  He was.  How old is your cousin?  He's in his 20s, you know, at a college and fucking working in a cubicle somewhere.  Just full of piss and vinegar.  So the Kumis are hoping that gold strikes twice?  Well, he was very excited.  He had a lot of fun doing it. 
[00:09:00]  And he's just like, get me out of it.  I fucking hate work.  I hate fucking going to the office.  I was like, put yourself together because he's really into sports.  Him and his friend into, like, sports betting.  They talk sports betting all the time and shit.  And they know there's shit about sports.  So I was like, yeah, come on.  Over.  And they came over last night.  A few beers.  Yapping about the fucking Jets and Giants and fucking Yankees.  And a bunch of other, you know, teams around the country that I have no clue about.  But he's taking calls. 
[00:09:30]  And, of course, you know, the likes of Lady Trucker call in.  And some of the listeners saying, where's Anthony?  Shut up.  And shit like that.  And he's just going, yeah, yeah.  What else?  What else?  What else you got?  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Like, I was watching him going, oh, that must be how I look.  You were proud.  Except younger.  You were proud.  Yeah, I was pretty proud.  RJ.  Yeah, RJ, my cousin, and his buddy Mike got up there.  They do all right?  For the first one?  Oh, fuck yeah.  They were going to do just an hour.  And they got up there. 
[00:10:00]  And the phone started ringing.  And they actually got a few sports calls in and talked about sports.  And used some of the multimedia equipment that I have to put some stuff on the screen.  And, yeah, that actually worked out good.  I think he wants to come over and do it, like, every Thursday.  Oh, boy.  You're building a network over there.  I know.  I'm like, what else?  We want to call it Clerical Corner.  I was laughing because the kid wore a blue shirt, Mike.  I'm like, great idea to wear a shirt that totally keys out. 
[00:10:30]  Why am I on the show?  Because Anthony's my cousin.  And he's sitting right in front of us.  That's straight up, dude.  Anthony's my cousin, and I have this opportunity.  And you don't.  But you can go back to your webcam and do your mediocre show and your monotone voice.  And just talk.  You're probably Jet fans that do that.  So you'll just talk Jet.  Wow.  Starting already, huh?  Yeah, we got it.  Let's make one thing straight.  Starting already.  Let's get it straight right off the bat.  Right off the bat.  There's one NFL team in this fucking city.  Okay?  And that's Giant Blue.  It's the Buffalo Bills.  One and all.  I'm done. 
[00:11:00]  I'm out.  He is a huge Giants fan.  He's a Giants fan?  Yeah, I just started yelling at him about how their opener sucked a dick.  And the Jets won, even though they weren't supposed to.  Right.  And he's just like, I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  I've been a Jets fan since the Richard Todd days.  So don't think I'm jumping on a fucking bandwagon.  You go old school.  I never liked the Giants.  Ever!  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the whole family, actually.  And aren't they from Long Island?  Yeah, but that whole family for a year. 
[00:11:30]  Jets have roots in Long Island.  His dad, all of my aunts and uncles are fucking diehard Giants fans.  Are they the guys that got the season tickets through the generations?  No, they go to a lot of games.  But they'd rather sit home and watch them on the big screen and yell and shit like that.  Well, the kid's confident, that's for sure.  Oh, yeah.  He's a cocky little fucker.  How's he related to you?  He's Uncle Joe and Yvonne's son.  And so it's my mother's brother's son. 
[00:12:00]  Gotcha.  Nice.  Yeah, he's definitely got that attitude.  And where do you get your personality from more?  Your mom or your dad?  It's a mixture.  But my mom has more of the funny shit going on.  And my dad more of the angry side.  Oh, really?  I definitely got a little both of that.  But look, I put him in a little sports box.  It's in a stadium.  It's like a suite in a stadium.  I love putting backgrounds in. 
[00:12:30]  Is it frustrating that your home setup is way nicer than this fucking place?  It does get a little frustrating when I walk in here and look around and go,  why can't we do that and have some type of visual element and just, you know.  And is it frustrating to know that it doesn't even cost that much to make this place way fucking better?  Relatively speaking, you could have a really kick-ass setup.  Is it frustrating to know that your microphones at home are way better than the ones we talk through?  They just sound great.  The phones always work nicely. 
[00:13:00]  I have a complete multimedia experience going on.  I can go to anything at the push of a button.  I could turn on my Fios cable feed and put any of the hundreds of channels on a screen behind me,  fade it to full screen, banners on the bottom, very moving visual element.  So these guys got maybe a year to try to figure it out.  Yeah, the fuck around.  Because if they don't, it's so obvious that you're ready to go.  You're ready to go. 
[00:13:30]  The picture now, I got the lighting down, the picture's clear.  I got a three-camera shoot now where I could go to a double shot like that, a wide shot,  and then I could, if somebody else is talking, a guest, I can go to camera three.  Boom!  Close up on them with the same background.  And now your guest is talking, and then go between the wide shot and the tight shot.  There's a lot of shit going on now that the regular civilian can do in their own home that's very exciting.  Yeah, at this point, I'm embarrassed to be here. 
[00:14:00]  No, I'm not even joking.  I hear you.  I'm not even joking.  I'll tell you why.  Because all the stuff you're doing at home, we suggested to SiriusXM.  And we were heading down this road with Mr. Eric Logan.  Logan understood the visual element.  He set up, how many cameras did we used to have?  Oh, my God.  Six, maybe?  I think six.  We had six at the time, state-of-the-art cameras.  So not only are they checking out a really cool radio show, because we do still do a cool radio show.  By the way, one of those cameras? 
[00:14:30]  I like to call camera two now.  Oh, right.  They also got to see the show.  It was a visual element.  Yes.  And for some reason, when we moved over to this shithole, I've had it, man.  I will walk soon.  We don't have a visual element.  And I know most people won't give a shit, and that's fine, because I'm fine with it.  But I've had it, because I know what this could be.  And they just have us rotting in this tiny little studio.  This was supposed to be temporary.  And I take a peek at what Ant's doing.  He's got way better shit in his stupid house than we have here at this big corporation. 
[00:15:00]  And we were promised a lot of shit.  And we sit here, and as the weeks go by, this is starting to feel really fucking old.  Old.  And there's so much new shit happening out there, you almost feel like if you don't jump in now, you're going to get passed right by.  Right.  When you see people like Joe Rogan, even Bobby Kelly is doing a great thing.  Adam Carolla.  Adam Carolla.  Then you've got, what's his name, Mark Maron. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  They are right there doing what is new and what people are really catching on to.  They want to watch their own shit when they want to watch it.  Yeah.  And that's the whole fucking deal right now.  Sure.  You know, we had a great Cloris Leachman interview yesterday, right?  You would think this dumb fucking company, maybe today's the day, that'd be great.  Yeah.  Start the weekend off right, because it's going to happen.  This stupid fucking company, the stupid fucks that supervise our channel, would try to figure out, wow, Cloris Leachman was out of her fucking mind. 
[00:16:00]  She was nuts, and visually, it was unbelievable.  We need a visual element to the Opie and Anthony show.  You would pop that shit online somewhere, and then people go, wow, not only is the radio show cool, I'm checking out a nice clip of Cloris Leachman now.  Yeah.  They don't even think enough to fucking even ask anyone, hey, was that video even worth putting anywhere?  Yep.  Did anyone talk to anyone?  No.  Of course not.  One of the guys thinks we're not even here today because we put out a joke tweet yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  That was hilarious.  And I'm supposed to acknowledge these guys?  Guys, we're fucking with Bobo saying his contest is canceled today, and one of the dumb supervisors was like, are the guys not on tomorrow?  Are they not showing up?  We're like, wait, what?  Like, really?  You're going to take a tweet to Bobo as the information as to whether we're going to show up or not?  There was not one listener that believed that we were not going to be here today. 
[00:17:00]  We were fucking around saying we might be sick because we don't, you know, the Bobo thing, whatever.  Yeah, we just fucking around like, you know, we don't want to deal with stupid Bobo.  And I like those.  I do like those guys.  I've turned the corner.  I like them as people.  So I'm not trying to fucking, you know, knock you down personally.  But I don't want to be here too much longer because this is really fucking old at this point.  You know what would really be kind of cool in here is to have, like, maybe three cameras set up, right?  Yeah.  And be able to control, have the whole room covered with camera angles for guests and us and whatever's going on. 
[00:17:30]  And maybe it's not on every day.  But when something's happening in here, be able to control it, turn it on, go to camera one, go to camera two.  Yeah.  Depending on the guest, you know, close up on if Jimmy's doing something fucking inane and hysterical over in the corner here, you know, be able to go to that.  Yeah.  It's simple.  And broadcast that over their own internet. 
[00:18:00]  You want web hits?  How about not saying go to our website, XM Sirius XM Satellite Radio slash blahdy blahdy blah.  How about go to Sirius XM slash Opie and Anthony live and you get a live video feed of what's going on in this studio at the same time you're getting the audio.  And I was good until Sam popped up what the live from the compound looked like last night.  I'm like, what the fuck?  No offense to your cousin.  He's never done radio before.  Look at his setup.  He has a much better setup than me. 
[00:18:30]  And I've been doing this business since I was 18.  And your cousin who works in a fucking cubicle, his first radio show looks like he's on network TV.  His first radio show.  He's an insurance.  He works in insurance.  Holy shit.  With his buddy Mike.  And look, they got a name of the show.  I don't know why it's Clerical Corner.  I just typed it in.  That's what they said.  And a phone number.  They got phone lines.  They're taking calls.  It looked great.  I was very proud of the young lad. 
[00:19:00]  Like you said, he had confidence.  Whether there was substance to the show or not, I could have given a fuck at that point.  It just looked good.  They were confident.  Honestly, the first minute sounded great.  I would check that shit out.  And any of the Anthony calls he got?  Yeah, because I was sitting right behind.  I was behind camera last night.  I'm starting to work behind the camera a little more with Life from the Compound.  Good for you.  And any time an Anthony call would come, he goes, really?  Yeah.  So you want to know?  Yeah.  It's his house.  Yeah, he's here.  Yeah.  Now what?  Yeah.  He's like, now what do you want?  I like this kid. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's all right, man.  He's spicy.  Probably the last time I saw him, he was five years old.  I think he was.  But I like him.  Yeah, yeah.  He definitely was.  I like this kid.  He's grown into quite this smart-ass, obnoxious little fuck.  But to summarize, we have no one.  I mean no one in this fucking building that has a vision for this fucking radio show.  Just let it sit like a rusting car.  Like a rusting car in the fucking, in the yard.  I've put out all the ideas that could work over the years, and they just have all fallen fucking flat. 
[00:20:00]  Because all these cocksuckers fire me today.  I don't give a fuck.  I got a great life outside this fucking place.  These fucking cocksuckers are just sitting around hoping they don't get fired.  That's all they do.  That pretty much is the game plan.  Dude, I'm on fire.  Because looking at what you're doing from your fucking basement.  That's crazy.  It's an embarrassment to us.  I mean, I'm happy for you.  I am too.  And after this shit blows up, you'll do great. 
[00:20:30]  But this fucking shit should have been what they were doing for us years ago.  Years ago, right.  And we started down that road.  It was good.  We had five, six cameras.  People were like, holy shit.  Not only do I love their radio show, now I get to see it.  And then it's up to the company to figure out how to make money off it.  Everything has to be money right from step one.  No, sometimes you've got to invest some time and materials, and then the money comes later.  Do you remember, one of my favorite moments, because we had cameras in the studio at XM, was the complete zoom in on Roland's face as Dr. Steve stuck a finger up his asshole. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And you saw him go like, whoo, and it was the whole thing as it happened.  Right.  People were able to watch it.  Oh, was it detrimental to subscribers?  No.  People were subscribing like crazy at the time.  Of course.  It was nuts.  It was part, it was, it was not a replacement for the satellite show. 
[00:21:30]  Of course.  It enhanced the show.  We're not talking about finding a replacement for satellite radio shows.  We're talking about enhancing it with technology that is out there and being used right the fuck now.  I hate being so much fucking smarter than everyone around me.  Oh, it is a task.  I fucking hate it.  Right, Sam?  Oh, why am I asking you?  Oh.  When I was coming up in this business, there was always someone where you're like, holy fuck, I could learn from that person.  That fucking person has knowledge, and they kept you humble? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  That went away years ago.  These guys are fucking jokes.  They don't have a fucking vision.  It's all old school.  And I go home every day going, we're just slowly rotting.  Yeah.  You know, some of the haters, you know what?  I'm going to give it to you today.  You're fucking right.  We're just slowly rotting away.  It feels old school.  There's no fucking vision for the show, where we're going.  Yeah.  The studio, we were promised a much better studio.  They put us in this shitty, tiny little box after we had an amazing fucking facility. 
[00:22:30]  It was supposed to be, oh, just temporary until we could figure it out.  Guess what?  We've been here two years, and we're just sitting here, waiting.  We're solitary.  Waiting for one of these scaredy cats to maybe come up with an idea that might get crazy.  Yeah.  You know what we are?  If we were a hip-hop, we would be, hey, I'm Anthony, and I'm here to say.  That's the type of hip-hop we'd be, because we're so old school sitting in here.  That's how, if I could put it on a level that people would understand, that's how we feel. 
[00:23:00]  We're Rapper's Delight of fucking, of radio.  Yeah.  We're the Sugar Hill Gang sitting here in 1979 saying a hip-hop, a hippie, a hippie, and  then other people are fucking, you know, hardcore fucking, like, raped.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is us.  Well, you know what?  It's good you're playing Sugar Hill Gang.  They released Rapper's Delight 32 years ago today.  Holy shit!  You tied that fucker in?  That's fucking right.  Now, that's...  That's what I do. 
[00:23:30]  That's professionalism right there.  And your shitty lights, guess what?  We don't even turn them on.  But we try to be nice about that, because, you know, you worked so hard on it.  What you did, you went into a fucking closet and got some of Howard's leftovers.  I want my own shit!  That's one thing.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I could fucking use one of those lights as a shoulder light.  Then take it.  It's side fills.  They don't even know.  It's the last thing I really need are side fills.  And I put some flesh, kind of flesh-colored gels over the front lights. 
[00:24:00]  And turned up the volume a little bit on them.  Oh, the look is crisp and clear.  I'm so excited at just the way it looks.  I don't even...  Sometimes I go, like, I'm not even going to fucking have a show put on or do anything.  I just stand there and look at it and go, God damn, that's a good-looking studio.  That's all.  Yeah, your lights suck.  It's not what I wanted.  No, this isn't quite it.  We wanted all these lights to look better.  So you throw in a couple fucking suns in the corner. 
[00:24:30]  We can't even turn them on.  It hurts our fucking eyes.  This is the...  Turn them on.  Go ahead.  The dual sons of Tatooine.  By the way, I apologize.  I was trying to be cooler after vacation.  I did last nine days.  Look, I'm blind.  We can't even use these fucking days.  It's crazy.  Wow.  People can see.  Yeah, see that?  It is crazy.  Oh, wow.  Well, and I only wanted a year of contracts, so it's driving me nuts that we're going into 
[00:25:00]  our second year.  Oh, you can't get aggravated in one year.  You need a good two years to build up that anger, Opie.  Oh, right.  This is hysterical.  I can't see.  Well, everything looks weird and shadowy like we're on the moon.  This was their solution, and I tried to be cool about it.  I really did.  But this is not what we wanted.  There's a ghost behind me. 
[00:25:30]  And guys are leaving the show one by one.  They don't even replace them anymore.  It's unbelievable.  We could get along without anybody, apparently.  They're looking back at the old AFK.  Are they trying to sell this place?  Is that what this is about?  I don't know.  Christ.  Christ, they are looking at, I think they're looking at AF days and saying, you know, O&A  did it by themselves years ago.  Why can't they just do that now?  I'll be doing it.  Let's get rid of everybody.  Give me another year.  I'll be doing it by myself.  And we'll be doing it by himself. 
[00:26:00]  Fuckers.  It does look like Close Encounters.  Can you turn off the lights?  These fucking lights.  Now I got spots.  Yeah.  I can't see it.  I'm seeing dots.  I don't know where anything is.  Ah, there it goes.  What does that mean?  Do I have little fucking tumors in my eyes?  What the fuck does that mean?  No, that was, uh, oh wow, I can't see anything.  Dude, I was cool until you just popped up that live from the compound.  And there's your cousin, who's the 20-some-odd-year-old kid, and he's got a much better setup for  his fucking first radio show.  First shot out of the gate, my friend.  First shot out of the gate. 
[00:26:30]  He did a great job.  And we just sit here, day after fucking day.  Yep.  With the same equipment.  No fucking vision whatsoever.  We want to go into the future.  That's what we want to do.  We want to be part of the future.  And, uh, when we're not really allowed to do that here, or it has to go through too much  bureaucratic bullshit, we need to exercise our creative spirit elsewhere.  So that's why we do our own home projects. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, it, you know, people, I love making videos.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, my videos aren't getting a huge audience, but they do well.  But the reason I do that, because, yeah, it feels great.  You can't just leave here and then go, well, I got nothing to do.  Fuck it.  I don't feel like I've exercised all of my creativity here, because I do love the visual  element.  I love the complete freedom of doing your own thing, whether it's video, audio, regardless 
[00:27:30]  of what it is.  Right.  It's just, it really is fulfilling to come up with an idea.  Let's say on a Saturday, you come up with an idea, you set your cameras up, your lights,  you make something funny, you edit it, and then you post it.  And it's like, I just made something cool.  And fuck it if it gets, you know, bitches.  People say, fuck it, it sucks.  It's just that much fun to do.  Right.  You know, and I don't feel that here.  And I was posting videos of stuff happening in the studio, and then they had to get on 
[00:28:00]  my case that needs a logo on and stuff.  I'm like, go fuck yourself.  Yes.  The logo.  Then get your own fucking guy in here to film shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm finally doing something that enhances the radio show, and then you have to get on  my case.  Ready?  We did.  Enough already.  There's no one here.  No one works on Fridays.  We're the only show that works on Fridays.  Oh, that is.  Howard doesn't even work on Thursdays anymore, and everyone's cool with that. 
[00:28:30]  Happy for him, personally.  I think it's great if you could get that shit.  I heard during our...  What's the last video they put up on the website of us?  Seriously, I want to know.  I want to know.  Because this is a great example of the fucking losers that are fucking running our channel.  This is...  They don't even keep up on shit.  What's the latest video?  Seriously.  Steve-O.  Too harsh for jackass.  How long ago was Steve-O in here?  What was that?  How long ago? 
[00:29:00]  Seriously.  It was posted...  How long ago?  On June 9th.  June!  It's cold out!  Are you serious?  I'm not kidding.  Is it there?  Do you know why?  Even I thought it would be like July or August.  Yeah, yeah.  It was June.  Seriously?  June 9th.  Do you realize it had just stopped being cold on June 9th and it's cold again today?  So these idiots who think they know what's going on, right?  Yeah.  Have decided that we don't need another video on the SiriusXM website since June. 
[00:29:30]  That's three months ago.  Yeah.  That's three months ago.  That's a whole quarter in the business world.  Yeah.  This is what I'm talking about.  These guys suck.  You gotta keep on top of things.  And I just about had it.  You gotta keep on top of things.  This is basic shit.  The world is passing us by as far as using technology for entertainment goes.  We should have woke up this morning, came in here, and without even asking and once  again ranting and raving, because I know, I'm not stupid, I know people are sick of this 
[00:30:00]  shit, but guess what?  I'm so sick of this shit, I'm gonna fucking walk soon, that these guys on their own should  have went, hey, good news, you know that Cloris Leachman shit?  It's online if you want to push the listeners to the website so they can now see how much  of a lunatic she was.  How crazy she was.  But that's not even a thought in these assholes' heads.  Not even a thought.  What they think is cool is having a Steve-O interview from June 9th up there representing  the show.  June fucking 9th.  Thank God he's still alive.  You know?  That would have been tragic.  Gerard Butler is an A-lister. 
[00:30:30]  If people woke up this morning and there's a Gerard Butler clip on SiriusXM, that's pretty  big for the company and our show.  He's dreamy.  Cloris Leachman, that's a biggie for our show.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the other shit.  Penn Jillette.  Penn, some of the stuff.  Pretty big fucking for the show.  And some of the stuff Penn was saying was so fucking good.  A story, a Penn story with him up there from fucking last week or something, this week,  to be up there to update it.  I don't...  Who does that, by the way?  Who does the website?  Yeah, who updates that?  Well, I mean, there's a web team that's under direction from our supervisors. 
[00:31:00]  I gotcha.  It's Gary's responsibility to understand shit, and he just doesn't understand shit.  He's a nice guy, and his new glasses are kind of cute.  It makes him look like he's an inventor from the early 1900s.  But besides that...  It looks like Harry Potter on chemo.  He thinks it's okay to have a video clip up there from June 9th representing the show.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't understand this shit.  Yeah.  The last person that understood this shit is Eric Logan. 
[00:31:30]  Period.  Tim Sabian understood us in the show.  Period.  Yeah.  The Joe Rogan experience.  Fucking podcast.  He's pumping him out like a motherfucking...  Like a worker bee.  And he does a three-camera shoot with him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Three-camera shoot for his podcast.  He's got like three cameras and three people, and then it's all split screen, so you can  see all the people.  Like, he figured things out.  Rogan figured it out.  There are ways you can figure shit out.  And if you don't have this detrimental Paul hanging over your head of a risk of getting 
[00:32:00]  in trouble, or this can't work, or we need money, or this isn't sponsored or sold, or  you guys just do this, you know, we must be allowed to spread our wings.  As it's said, spread our wings.  And please stop tweeting me about the app.  I gave up on that.  There's no answers.  What?  Is there a problem with it?  The app goes down every afternoon.  There's no answer.  Like a cheap form.  They say there's no problems, but, you know, my Twitter is fucking cluttered with people 
[00:32:30]  that are disappointed in the online fucking feed.  My opinion is there's too many people trying to use it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So maybe they got to figure it out on a technical, you know, from a standpoint.  Thank you.  From a technical standpoint.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  But there you go.  You're doing better stuff from your basement.  Well, I'm having fun.  Good for you.  Especially behind the camera.  Look how nice that looks.  That's a nice fucking webcast right there. 
[00:33:00]  That looks good.  And we got a Steve-O interview, which, by the way, not Steve-O's greatest appearance.  It was an okay appearance.  He came in to promote his book, and he's a friend of the show.  And that's the last video clip that's up on SiriusXM representing Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And I got my...  A brochure came out.  ...notious cousin from fucking mere hours ago is up.  A brochure came out recently, and once again, we have a tiny logo representing the show.  And then I go to Gary.  This is bullshit.  He goes, you know what?  It really is bullshit.  I'm like, oh, fuck. 
[00:33:30]  How about you do something about it before it is released?  How about this?  I clicked on a link last night.  I didn't check into this.  I don't know how true it is or anything.  But it looked like one of the units, and it had our channel up there.  And it had the subject we were talking about.  And the picture in the background was Howard.  Oh, I know.  They were advertising for him or something on the...  ...fucking whatever they call the screen.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:00]  So I didn't know.  I didn't give a shit, because, you know, whatever.  My radio says high voltage still, so...  Does it?  Yeah.  Because I figured it this way.  Hey, at least they got some kind of Howard element on the platform.  Even if it's just his picture over our show being played.  At least there's an element there.  Boy, someone wants to know if my cunt hurts.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, it's a little itchy, too.  A little.  A little.  A block!  Mine stings a bit. 
[00:34:30]  Time for you to go to Black Island!  I love when we do these rants, because the fucking rats come up.  Yeah, they come up.  They come up.  It's like we throw out some shit and stuff and cheese, and they all come up to squash.  Yep.  Sorry, maybe in your life you accept people beating the shit out of you and fucking treating  you like crap, but guess what?  I've never accepted that, you loser.  Right.  You're a fucking loser.  You and the rest of the fucking rats that are coming to the surface, you'll all be blocked. 
[00:35:00]  And guess what?  Your lives will be shitty because of it.  Because of it, right.  And you know it.  You'll miss out on hijinks.  You know it in the end.  Your life gets a little shittier when you get blocked by one of us.  It really does.  I love when the rats come up.  A lot of rain, and they're coming up for fucking air.  Oh, that's...  What?  I don't know.  I'm just reading some kind of stuff.  No, you know what?  Sam's a soldier.  I know he is.  I'll say it.  Sam is now listing all the stuff that has happened since June 9th that definitely could 
[00:35:30]  have been a nice little video clip on SiriusXM if we had someone that knew what the fuck  they were doing.  Yeah.  Oh, the Hard Rock.  Could have had a clip from the Hard Rock Cafe.  What a great appearance that was at the Hard Rock.  Showing all the fans coming out and enjoying the show.  That would be a nice little fucking marketing thing for us.  Everybody doing their comedy.  The staff doing the comedy.  Book of Mormon cast.  Only the Hottest Fucking Show on Broadway.  A little clip of that on SiriusXM.  That would have been nice.  Les Zeppelin.  Les Zeppelin.  You remember?  Some Led Zeppelin shit.  Guy Fieri.  These are all like, you know, big celebrities in their own right. 
[00:36:00]  Lots of Jersey Shore people.  It's not like Jersey Shore is a big show.  And if you have a fucking clip of Pauly D or Sammy Sweetheart or Vinny up on SiriusXM,  that's not going to get a lot of attention at all.  Because those fucking people fart and they get a hundred fucking thousand views.  There's Sully from Gottsmack.  He's a great guy.  Brooke Shields.  Elijah Wood.  Why would you have a clip of Elijah Wood on SiriusXM?  That doesn't.  That's not big.  Louis C.K.  Ricky Gervais. 
[00:36:30]  But we have a clip that's three months old.  How about fucking, yeah, Ryan Reynolds.  Ryan Reynolds had his fucking nose buried in that fine ass we were looking at.  That's right.  Oh, God.  Well, Steve-O's up there at least from June.  So enjoy, people.  If you missed it, it's there.  And it'll probably remain there.  I don't know how much longer this is going to last.  I'll be honest with each other.  It's frustrating.  I'll be honest with everybody. 
[00:37:00]  I mean, because I'm out of my mind with this shit.  Yeah.  We have shitty people that don't have a vision for the channel.  We have a company that doesn't really, you know, look at us as, you know, a big show.  No.  They really don't.  Even though we're bringing in the subscribers.  We know that.  How about we're bringing our bodies into work?  We have a shitty studio.  We don't have a visual element still.  Yeah.  We're just trying to fight to get back to where we were two years ago.  Yeah.  Let's fight to get to the starting line. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  That's what we're doing.  Yeah.  Sugar Ray Leonard.  Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad.  Captain America.  Captain America wasn't a big movie.  So why would you have a Chris Evans clip up there?  And I understand some of these people probably don't allow video because that's what happens  in our world.  Yeah.  But I would guarantee on that list at least 75% of those people would have allowed a video  clip.  Yeah.  And it should have been online.  How about fucking Tyra?  Tyra was in.  That was kind of cool to have her in there.  And I think I actually made one of the English papers there with that. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was in the mirror or something.  Oh, really?  One of those limey papers.  Me and Tyra standing there.  And it said, Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  Meh.  Meh.  But that was kind of, that was cool.  Having her in there.  No one will ever know who you were.  No one will ever know who you were.  I love singing.  I love singing segments.  Because I never mentioned your Twitter name. 
[00:38:30]  Ah, so no one will ever know.  If you block a person with no followers, did they really ever exist in the first place?  And you know what?  I can't, I can't tell you why I know this, but I know this because I'm dealing with some  shit right now.  You know, that's a lot of these fucking losers that you block.  They're so obsessed with us and want to be part of this that they just open up new Twitter  accounts.  New account. 
[00:39:00]  And you can tell because they bash you.  I've been smashing the same guy down for over a year.  And I know for a fact, you know, he opened up at least 20 accounts.  Yeah.  That is, that is a loser.  You're a fucking loser.  When you see zero followers, one tweet.  Right.  It's like just the tweet to you.  It's like, really?  You just decided today that I'm an idiot and you got to bash me or I blocked you.  And now this is a brand new account for you to try to fucking, you know, be an asshole  on.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:39:30]  Correctamundo.  So there you go.  And it's a live from the compound.  That was fun with my cousin, RJ.  And this is buddy, Mike.  Doing their first radio show.  They're going to be doing that on Thursdays.  So I'll be behind the camera.  And it's, uh, and it looks way the fuck better than what we got going on after many, many years  of doing this.  I think it looks vibrant.  I think I got the lighting down.  I think it's vibrant.  It's unbelievable.  It really looks very nice.  It looks like that's a TV show.  Yeah.  It really does.  It looks like a TV show.  Yeah.  That's what I want it to look like. 
[00:40:00]  Except we were drinking a few beers beforehand.  They are of age, you know.  You should, uh, you should get some sets, some actual sets that you could throw in and  out.  Oh, real, like real.  Yeah.  I mean, I know the green screening works.  Absolutely.  The virtual sets, but you should get a couple of little sets that you could fucking play with  next.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  You pull down something from the back.  I could just pop whatever the fuck back there.  Maybe a map of Long Island.  Why not?  Why not?  Well, it's, it is a lot of fun. 
[00:40:30]  And like I said, when you want to just, uh, can't hear you because you're blocked.  Oh, does that suck?  Never knew who you were.  Now you're just out there by yourself.  Yeah.  Oh, I know that drives you nuts.  Go ahead and make another account.  Have fun.  Jesus Christ.  So what do we got today?  We got the Bobo dating game, the prostitution contest.  Finally, this is going down.  Nice.  Well, it's not prostitution, but yeah, it's a Bobo dating game. 
[00:41:00]  Winner gets a thousand dollars.  Three good looking girls coming in.  I'm very upset that I never got to see pictures of these fucking girls.  We could show you right now.  All right.  Yeah, let's see.  Let me see these pictures.  These are the three finalists?  Yes.  Because I want to see what these finalists look like.  And we got Bob Kelly coming in today just to give you the lineup here.  Uh, Jason Mayhem Miller from the MMA there.  Jason Mayhem Miller!  Uh, and Tracy Lourdes.  We haven't talked to her in a while.  Yeah.  Probably haven't talked to her in 10 fucking years.  Last Drag.  She got a new album? 
[00:41:30]  Ugh.  Really?  Christ.  Right?  What is that about?  Show your ass.  All right.  That's one of them.  And that's...  What?  This is Courtney.  All right.  That's Courtney.  Yeah, she's one of them.  Okay.  She's all right.  Courtney.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm just saying.  She's all right.  For Bobo?  Yeah, I mean, are you kidding me for Bobo?  That's a fucking 20.  Yeah.  For Bobo, that's a fucking supermodel.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  For me, that's like, you know, fuck. 
[00:42:00]  That's all right.  Uh, why is the blurry pit?  What the hell is that?  Oh, she's all right.  Hang on.  Um...  You don't know who the finalists are?  I remember...  Well, there was one that was a maybe.  So that's...  I know who the two of them are.  Yeah.  Uh, but there was one who, uh, has never listened to the show before.  Right.  Her uncle.  Her uncle had listened to the show.  Oh, really?  Her uncle pimped her out and sent her here.  Uh, who else?  This one is the favorite.  Well.  Well.  Well, well, well. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  I thought this was far and away the frontrunner.  That is definitely a frontrunner.  Christy Ann.  And what's her story?  Well, uh, she's a 23-year-old college student at William Patterson.  Um, uh, she commutes to school with her friend.  That's how she got into the show.  Uh, he begged her to sign up for the contest.  And she figured, you guys seem cool.  She's a happy girl.  She smiles a lot.  Lots of energy.  And, uh, a date with Bobo would be quite an experience. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  And, I mean, Bobo would certainly become erect on sight of Christy Ann.  Are we playing the up and down thing with this, uh, contest?  Well, um.  Tell me right now.  Tell me where we're at with that.  Because that's the only reason we would do this.  We'd have the girls talk to Bobo and see which, uh, one could get him more excited.  Yeah.  Well, he will be, he will be partitioned.  So, I mean, he's not allowed to see the girls.  So, assuming the girls couldn't see him doing that, that would be fine.  Oh, I bet you there's a problem with that. 
[00:43:30]  Probably.  I'll, I'll check.  Sure.  I'm sure there's some kind of problem where if the girls are talking kind of a little sexy to Bobo,  and then we see if Bobo's kind of, you know, reacting.  Somehow there's going to be a problem with that, right?  Yeah.  Oh, here comes, uh, our fearless producer.  If Bobo, if they can't see Bobo.  Yeah.  Can we watch him do the up and down game?  No.  If he, not even if he's behind the position.  No, they would, they would really rather not.  Now, if they can't see him.  Why would they rather not?  Why is that a problem? 
[00:44:00]  Why is that a problem?  Like, I don't get it.  How could that be a problem?  Because the, the sponsor would, would prefer no penises.  Who's the sponsor?  Trojan.  Trojan, that's their whole business model.  The whole gig is dark penises.  You're kidding, right?  Dark penises.  No.  That's hilarious.  No, see, this is why.  That's hilarious.  This is why these idiots will never understand.  You, do you understand how infuriating this is?  You fucking dopes out there.  I see it as a bit of irony.  Uh, yes.  Trojan would rather not have penises in their contest that they're associated with. 
[00:44:30]  That's a joke, right?  No.  We're lampooning now.  This is a serious show.  We're lampooning, right?  It's like Purdue not wanting chickens in their, in their fucking promotion.  You're kidding.  I'm not saying I understand it.  I'm just.  Yeah.  This could be relaying information.  Good year said, no tires.  No tires, please.  No tires.  We've heard some shit over the years, but this could be the most unbelievable thing I've  ever heard.  Maybe it's doing radio.  And don't they know Bobo's, uh, it doesn't even, it doesn't even count.  It doesn't count.  It doesn't qualify as a penis. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe it's the mistreatment of penises.  It's like Purdue wouldn't want to be associated with the mistreatment of chickens to see Bobo's  tiny, gnarled up genitalia is like sort of the mistreatment of penises.  But if the whole goal is to get it to get erect, that is what Trojan's all about, is the erect  penis.  How tough of a goal is that?  Roll one of them congrats on.  Roll it on, right?  So instead we'll just have some kind of shitty dating game with Bobo.  It won't be shitty.  No, it won't be shitty.  We've come up with some questions.  And we don't have to fake it like we used to on regular radio because we were so scared 
[00:45:30]  of ratings.  No, we're going to have just shitty radio now.  That's fine.  I don't give a fuck.  We don't have to go like, holy shit, this is going to be fantastic.  People make sure you do it.  It's like, nah, it's going to suck ass.  It's going to suck ass.  We've got production and questions and fun.  We came up with some good questions.  I don't doubt the staff did above and beyond the call of duty.  Yeah, I don't know.  You guys are wonderful.  Thank you.  And I mean that.  There's no sarcasm.  You're wonderful too.  None of my anger goes toward you guys ever.  Yes.  And that's the truth.  So one's above you. 
[00:46:00]  High fives all around.  Yes.  Obviously the Bobo prostitution game.  It's a dirty game.  Should you be Bobo naked and the girls talking dirty and seeing which one could get him going  the most.  And they don't even have to see him.  And Trojan.  That would be the fastest game we've ever played.  Yeah.  That's true.  There wouldn't be a lot of suspense.  No.  So?  We only need to do the contest for five minutes.  We don't have to, you know, drag it out.  Well, but Trojan doesn't want penises.  Well, the rules of the-  Trojan doesn't want penises, Ed! 
[00:46:30]  No!  The rules that we, you know, the game works is that Bobo has to remember what the girls  said.  So that's kind of what they signed up for.  So if we change the rules of the game on the spot, Trojan could be like, what the fuck?  That's not what I signed up for.  Oh.  Okay.  I have no fucking idea.  You don't?  Whatever.  No?  Whatever.  Hey, does Xbox have something like the Move Sharp shooter, like for PlayStation?  Hmm?  What's that?  It's a portable, like, gun thing that you can shoot at your screen. 
[00:47:00]  They don't have that yet?  No.  Why?  What the fuck is with Xbox?  Because the PlayStation Move is kind of like the Xbox Kinect.  Right.  So the Move is like a little, you know, thing, but it can go into, you know, like a golf club  or, you know, a gun.  But shouldn't Xbox have a gun so we can start playing some fucking, like-  Like Duck Hunt?  What, is Xbox being left behind?  Duck Hunt.  Like Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, I think as far as this is concerned.  Is PlayStation 3-  No, Kinect is killing move.  Kinect's killing move.  But I do like the handheld rifle, the little gun that you get, because for shooters, I want 
[00:47:30]  to be able to, like, shoot.  Well, maybe with Kinect, maybe they'll create a sensor where it knows when your hands are  in gun formation.  I don't want to hold, I need to hold a real gun.  I don't want to sit there with a fake gun in my hand with the machine saying, hey, look,  he's got a gun in his hand.  I want something that I can fucking hold on to.  You know what I mean?  Like a gun.  Yeah, like a gun.  Like Duck Hunt.  It would be odd if I had to actually use one of my real guns so that the sensor could 
[00:48:00]  pick my hands up.  You know?  It would be a little dangerous.  Duck Hunt.  Boy, you remember that?  All you had to do was hit the screen to kill something.  I know.  I would get real close to the TV.  My sister would say I was teasing.  Did mother clap when you hit a duck?  She didn't like gunplay in the house.  No?  She didn't like toy guns.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Wow, mother didn't like it.  She didn't like it.  I wasn't allowed to have a toy gun until I was like 12.  Yeah, my mom didn't like that shit.  Well, she knew you would have shot the guy that came by and stole her.  That's true. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  I knew that was coming.  Yeah, of course you did.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Oh.  No apologies.  Well, that blonde now, is it the one on the left or the one on the right?  It's actually the tiger.  Is it the tiger?  Yes.  Because I'm looking at a picture of a tiger.  And then I see this older woman.  No.  Yeah.  And then I see a young blonde hair.  Pretty nice looking blonde.  Jackie is the 26 year old from Manhattan who hasn't listened to the show before, but  her uncle says it's good.  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  And who's the third?  And then the third one is the third one.  Christiane.  That's the one that sort of looks like Olivia from Jerseylicious.  Oh, my God.  She's a cute girl right there.  She's a high.  She's got a cute look.  We also figured that since she's wearing kind of a boostier type of thing here, that maybe  she would be wearing something exciting for Bobo today.  Hopefully.  Fingers crossed.  Is there a suggestion made that perhaps she'd dress a little sexily?  We made a suggestion.  I like the cutesy little smile picture on the right.  I think she's got a big ass.  What?  She's not showing it? 
[00:49:30]  Yep.  Oh, wait a minute.  What about that?  Yep.  Right there.  No, right there.  She's barely showing it, man.  It's dark, and then the picture cuts off right at the ass line.  I can't wait to see it.  Yeah.  Who got passed over?  Oh, well, Lady Trucker was the first one to get unanimous noise.  Lauren, for whatever reason.  Danny voted against her.  I don't know why.  Of course he did.  I don't know why.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, it was weird.  She's blowing up a whoopee cushion.  Yeah, she looked wacky to us, but Danny, I don't know.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Who's that?  Laura.  Yeah.  Got voted off.  Is that the Laura we know?  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  It is.  Yes.  Why did she get passed up?  Well, because Courtney got passed in.  Courtney is, she's the half Filipino.  Yeah, half Filipino, half Polish.  Half Polish.  Born and raised in Connecticut.  Connecticut.  She looks like she's put together well.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, clothes don't do her justice.  No.  But naked, I bet that's fucking smoking. 
[00:50:30]  And you gotta imagine Bobo would love them titties.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  I hope there's no fucking fake titty shit going on there.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Where they put those cutlets underneath, right?  Are they allowed to get...  Yeah, Bobo would have a real problem with that.  Are the women allowed to get naked if they feel like it?  I mean, if they're hot.  I haven't heard anything against that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you probably will now.  Who's this woman doing a soap ad?  That's Andrea.  I mean, we all thought she was, you know, like, cute or whatever, but...  Well, she kind of looks like...  If you squint, she's cute. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  All right.  She's probably listening to her.  Well, that's fine.  She has an Amy Poehler thing going on.  Yeah, okay.  All right, you're right.  And this was the last one.  That was Leah.  Oh.  Yuck.  Well.  No, she's cute.  Yeah.  I shouldn't have said that.  22.  She's eight.  Okay.  She almost actually made it into the three.  Good choices.  Good choices.  But we were confident.  I mean, especially once Jackie admitted that she hadn't heard the show before, she actually  became a shoe-in.  A shoe-in because she's never heard of this Bobo character. 
[00:51:30]  She does not know what he does.  No.  No.  Does not know what our show is all about.  Which is...  You think she's been listening to get a, like, catch up?  No.  Can we check to see if Bobo's got an erection with his pants on?  Oh, my goodness.  Right now?  Well, I mean, I guess...  At the time.  In the contest.  But Trojan doesn't want erect penises.  That is my understanding.  This could be the most unbelievable thing.  Penises in general.  Erect or flasked.  Why?  What are they trying to do?  I guess they didn't sign up for the Get Bobo Hard contest. 
[00:52:00]  But they're Trojan.  But it's Trojan.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess they're not...  They want to be known as, what, a classy company or something?  What are they doing?  It's America's condom.  Yeah.  But it's, you know, it's a condom.  It goes on a penis.  Erect.  You can't get...  I just know that the sponsor would prefer all penises to stay in their pants for the  duration of the segment.  Wow.  This world is losing its fucking mind.  It's just...  I don't know what to think.  All the way around.  I don't know what to think.  This world is losing its fucking mind. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know what to think.  What?  What?  Trojan's trying to be a blue chip company or something?  What's that?  He's not here, so I had to.  Yeah.  So they want...  That's...  I'm stunned.  They don't...  So they...  I don't even know how to explain this.  I'm trying to, like, look at it from their point of view.  They sell condoms.  Sell condoms.  That's right.  But they don't want penises when they're sponsoring a contest.  Doing an event that involves... 
[00:53:00]  Dating.  Dating.  Which would lead to maybe finally using that condom in your fucking wallet.  And the fact that Bobo's going to take a condom with him from Trojan.  If a penis appears, then they have a problem with the contest.  And Bobo's actual claim to fame has been his penis on this show.  His tiny little dick.  I thought it was a sense of humor.  His stupidity.  His utter stupidity.  Moron.  And his horrific penis.  I'm trying to think, like, the CEO of Trojan Ant.  Yeah.  But the problem is, there's only one use for a condom.  You can't say, well, yeah, I know we do the penis thing with the fucking Trojans. 
[00:53:30]  But let's not forget, we make balloon animals with them, too.  Well, in the NOM, they did put it over the barrels of their guns when they went through the swamps.  But, you know.  Maybe it's one of those Playboy things.  Like, Playboy, like, we'll show a little titty, but we're not going to show penetration.  Ah.  Trojan's like, look, you use it for sex, but that's a private affair for you and your loved ones.  Wow.  We're a classy company.  I would love to talk to someone from Trojan, because I really want to see their philosophy on this.  Try to figure this out.  Because it doesn't make sense.  Here's what I bet you'd get. 
[00:54:00]  Hi, Trojan.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up?  Love the show.  I love that one.  Love the show.  And then you go, really?  What part?  You know, that time when you did that thing.  The whole thing.  The whole genre.  Yeah.  Never heard a fucking minute of this show.  What's up?  What's up?  Well, we just want to know why we can't have Bobo take his dick out and get an erect penis,  because it's Trojan, and they prefer not to.  You're a condom company.  What?  Wait a minute.  Who told you that?  Well, we heard it was you guys. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no, no, no, no.  That must be management or something.  Let me check.  I'll make a few phone calls, and then we'll get to the bottom of this, which, by the bottom of it,  I mean somebody that has no responsibility in this, and it's a conglomerate of people,  and no one's to blame.  Okay, take it easy.  Have fun.  Hey, is Gary here?  No.  Of course not.  Why would he be?  I'm texting with him right now, so he's here in spirit.  Why would he be here when we're doing a big dating fucking show today? 
[00:55:00]  Does he think we're here?  I don't know.  Does Tim Sabian show up for Howard's show around 7, 8 o'clock?  No.  Of course not.  He's here.  I know Ant doesn't like management, but it would be nice if they're at least in a fucking  office just in case we need to ask him something.  He's there towards the beginning.  Why would you show up at 7 o'clock if our show starts at 6, and you're technically the  supervisor of this fucking thing?  He didn't show up at 7 o'clock.  I want to know what Trojan said to them.  Oh, he's not even here at 7, so he might be here at 8.  That's right.  I'm dumbfounded, as they say. 
[00:55:30]  I want to know exactly what Trojan said, because then I'm going to talk to the Trojan people.  In Gary's defense, he probably doesn't know.  This is more of a sales thing than a Gary thing.  Yeah.  But why would he know what's going on with us and the channel?  He thinks a Steve-O clip from June 9th is completely acceptable to represent the show  on the SiriusXM website.  June 9th.  2011.  June 9th.  I'm fucking losing my mind right in front of you. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  This is fantastic.  Fuck, I've been doing this since I was 18.  Holy shit, I'm losing my fucking mind.  Finally.  It's finally cracking, right?  Yes.  I hear you.  This is pure lunacy.  Oh, Christ.  I worked my whole fucking career for nothing.  This is all fucking nothing.  It's like trying to get out of the woods and realizing you just walked in a big circle. 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit.  You see your old campground and it went, oh my God, I'm back here.  Right.  What happened?  I thought I was making some headway.  And then you're just back where you are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  Josh!  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Do you want to eat our sandwiches?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take a little breather?  Yeah, that's fine.  Where's my fucking coffee?  I'm going to eat some.  Did I do my coffee already?  Yeah, you did.  Six o'clock.  Oh, shit.  Get another hot cup so we can heave it in someone's face when they walk in. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, I know who is.  You know what?  I'll be honest.  I was totally fine today.  I really was.  I know.  Until you wanted to give a little plug for a live from the compound, show what your  cousin was doing yesterday.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Very proud of the young boy.  Did that snap in my fucking head?  It really was just a, what did you do last night?  Oh, I did a show from the compound.  Oh, fucking yeah.  And then things went sound.  Look how nice that looks.  The graphics.  It sounds better because Ann has better equipment at his house than we have here. 
[00:57:30]  You got to.  It's got to sound good.  It's got to look good.  Does the compound need an after show?  No, actually, I don't think so.  Yeah, I think I'm okay without an after show right now.  Yeah.  Hey, look who's here.  Roland, how's your voice?  That's all right.  It's a little better today, Roland.  It's a little better.  You don't sound as great.  Try to clear your throat.  Nice.  Oh, you know what?  Daniel's right.  Yeah.  Daniel Bobo.  Curlin. 
[00:58:00]  Mr. Malunigans is the best dog ever.  I'm going to go Daniel.  It might be Danielle.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  I don't know how that shit works sometimes.  Yeah, that's true.  Daniel, Jersey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  There's other things you can do with a condom besides for sex.  Oh, really?  I'm trying to figure that out right now.  Go ahead.  You can stuff it with, like, cocaine or heroin or something.  Oh, jeez.  And mule it up your ass.  That is true.  A condom can be used for that. 
[00:58:30]  So, shut our mouths.  That guy fucking schooled us.  Oh, that's great.  Punch it out, boys.  It's not just for penises.  They're right.  We could have a smuggling illegal drugs.  We could have a girl try to shove a condom full of something up Bobo's asshole.  Powdered sugar.  What do we got around here that's safe?  We have flour?  We could find some flour.  Baking soda, even.  I will give Bobo $200.  We're going old school with our bits today.  $200 if he fucking shoves a condom filled with flour up his ass. 
[00:59:00]  I like it.  And mules it for the rest of the show.  Would that be considered penetration?  I'm not fucking penetrating.  What if he puts his ass off the air?  If he penetrates himself, yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  And then he comes back from the bathroom where he was in a closed stall by himself.  And he's like, it's up there.  It's up there for the show.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[00:59:30]  That is fucking beautiful.  All right, we'll have some more horse shit after the break.  Yes, we will.  As we just sit here and fucking rot.  Stag, mate.  With no one having a fucking clue above the people in this studio.  We're like standing water with mosquito larvae in us.  The guy doesn't even think it's important enough to show up early today when we're going to have a big event with fucking Bobo and girls and sponsors.  He's at home.  He'll make it in eventually.  It is cold outside.  It's like sleepy weather.  Mayhem Miller coming up in the next hour. 
[01:00:00]  June 9th, really.  June 9th.  2011.  And no one thought.  And I'm sure they'll put the blame on you guys.  Oh, why did you fucking talk?  Yeah, yeah, you guys.  Oh, my God.  Before this shit makes the air, you got to let us know what's going on with these guys.  You are never to blame.  Before it gets to this point.  I know.  I know what goes on.  Land in my court.  That's why I stopped doing the meetings a long time.  I can't deal with that shit.  You are never to blame.  Guys, it would really be helpful if you just told us what they're thinking before it makes  the air. 
[01:00:30]  It's like I'm in those meetings, right?  It's like I'm a fly on the wall, right?  That's because of almost 30 years of experience in this business.  I had chills.  Guys, once again, you know, you failed us, you know, you should have let us know that  the last clip on SiriusXM was from June 9th.  And oh, boy, if you would have just told us this whole thing would have happened.  You would have updated it.  And I wouldn't have looked like an asshole again.  Yes, it would have been perfect.  That's because you don't have skills to do this. 
[01:01:00]  What are condoms used for?  Penis, vulva, our anus.  See?  That's right.  Just want to let everyone know.  A little song.  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it.  You let one drop spill and I'll rip your ass so hard you won't sit down for it.  Wait.  There's no condom use there.  No.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Nice.  Right.  Any condoms in this clip?  I'll lick my sweaty balls. 
[01:01:30]  Could be.  Could be.  Could be.  Could be.  How about this?  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Probably.  Probably could be.  I hope so.  Safe sex is important.  Who does not adore that guy's voice?  He is a straightforward kind of guy.  He really is adorable.  Oh, by the way, this will not lead to a meeting today.  Oh, meeting schmeeting.  It's Friday.  And not only that, I'm telling everyone right now, I will not be here Monday.  Oh.  You won't.  No.  Oh.  I got vacation days I gotta still burn. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, look at that.  What's Monday?  Roman's like, ha, dee, boo, boo, boo.  There's enough people to do the radio show.  I'm not going to be here.  No, I'm not going to be here.  What's up?  And I don't think I'm going to be here Friday either.  Not today's Friday.  And I don't think I'll be here the following Monday after that and the Friday after that.  And for the foreseeable future.  Believe it or not, this will surprise a lot of people.  I still have five vacation days I have to burn before October 1st. 
[01:02:30]  They ain't getting a free fucking day from me.  That's pretty certain.  You know what?  I haven't even checked on mine.  I think you have this many.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, really?  I'm burning, motherfucker.  Then we're burning some days.  I'm burning.  I'm burning.  I'm burning for you.  Why don't you just not take them and do the show for the fans?  If they want to pay me for it, that's fine.  Yeah.  Is there cash back?  Do I have carryover days?  Or if they can move up the last day of my contract, that's fine too.  I'll do it that way.  You'd like that?  Fuck yeah.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  You stop taking vacation so your contract could end like way sooner. 
[01:03:00]  Sam, were you in my head on the way in?  I said to myself, I'm like, okay, I think we get, with company holidays and stuff, five,  six weeks maybe.  I'm thinking, all right, I don't take one day, then this contract ends a month sooner.  Wow.  Oh, then you just say, hey, I'm on vacation.  I'm taking sick days.  I'm this.  I'm that.  Yeah.  And then you're done for the month.  Yeah.  For the last month.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  It's too bad, really, because we have something really, really special still.  Of course.  But, you know, I'm losing my mind. 
[01:03:30]  Everyone's losing their fucking minds.  And I'm not alone.  I'm just the voice of this fucking thing.  Trust me.  Yeah.  And it feels exactly the same.  Oh, yeah.  I see.  Exactly.  Every day.  But I have to be the fucking asshole about it.  That end of the hallway or something.  If you're behind the camera, Ant, does that mean one day the clerical corner guys are going  to be bitching about you not understanding anything?  Probably.  Okay.  Probably.  I can see that.  Clerical corner.  They already have better stuff than we do.  One fucking show.  The clerical corner. 
[01:04:00]  One fucking show.  I had to whip the graphic up in probably two minutes.  I just fucking tick, tick, tick, picked one out, picked out a lower third, popped it  up there.  But that's going to be worked on where, you know, it's a moving graphic.  Oh, my gosh.  Like, you know, you know the news channels, they've got the moving graphic thing, maybe  a spinning icon in the corner.  Like a baseball?  Things like that, yeah.  To give it more of a sports feel, to let people know it's more of a sports show.  That was thrown together in a matter of minutes.  And the hot thing now is to put your hashtag to whatever show. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Right on the corner.  Hashtag clerical corner bitch.  Exactly.  Really?  Put your hashtag.  Every show has that little hashtag.  I actually have a Facebook and a Twitter icon that comes, like, and it's an alpha channel,  so you can see behind it.  Yeah.  And it comes spinning into the scene and shows the fucking Twitter address.  Wow.  That, and then flies back off the screen.  Is anybody ever worried it's going to hit them while they're watching?  Hey, if it was 3D, motherfucker, you'd be ducking.  Yeah.  You'd be ducking.  Wow, that's just like what we have here. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Hashtag.  You've got to say it because you're on the radio.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Can we do audio?  Yeah, that's right.  Can we do audio hashtags?  Audio hashtags.  Yeah, hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Opie radio on Twitter.  Hashtag left from the compound.  Why are you guys hashtag?  Hashtag Anthony Cumia.  It's supposed to hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Nah, we're individuals now.  One hashtag.  Pretty obvious to everyone.  It's stupid.  One hashtag.  This company's trying to drive the wedge.  Right. 
[01:05:30]  Drive the wedge through giving us zero ability to be creative.  By ourselves through this lack of penetration.  And fucking Bobo can't do the up and down.  Even if the chicks aren't watching.  He can't be home and suck Mr. Maloonigan's dick.  Because it's some type of penetration.  What does it mean?  It's oral penetration.  Well, whatever.  I'm sure he's doing it anyway.  I'm sure.  Who's kidding?  Who's here?  Pick up the phone.  That's the only difference.  I gotta eat.  I'm going to fucking... 
[01:06:00]  I'm starving.  I'm cracking the seal.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Hashtag eat.  What's the hashtag Opie and Anthony mean even?  Because that way people will hashtag Opie and Anthony and it will raise awareness and  become a trending topic and we will be the next big thing.  These fuckers didn't toast my bagel good enough.  I hate a fucking raw bagel.  Hashtag raw bagel.  Or hashtag shit fuck dick shit from downstairs.  Hey, why is it you toast a bagel and it tastes so much fucking better?  I don't get that.  You're just drying it out a little bit, right? 
[01:06:30]  You want me to get a better one?  Kenny.  I would love it.  That means we get to talk longer because now you gotta wait for food.  Kenny, I would love it.  Thank you, sir.  I don't mean to put you on the spot.  Opie Radio Twitter.  You just fucked up my fucking audio hashtag.  Well, it's par for the course around here.  How about Kenny's Facebook?  What is that?  Facebook slash Club Story Kenny.  No, but you didn't do the lasers.  If we're gonna do audio hashtag, you gotta do lasers. 
[01:07:00]  Like a...  Because that brings attention to it.  Kenny.  Want a nice omelet?  That's not what I wanted there.  Kenny.  You're supposed to plug your Facebook.  It's all you do.  How are you not plugging your Facebook when you're supposed to?  He told me on the way home the other day he can only think of one thing at a time  and he almost ran over two women.  He's laughing his ass up.  I had to actually go, holy shit, stop.  Because he almost took out two mothers with strollers with newborns. 
[01:07:30]  I was thinning the herd.  He almost took him out of it.  And I had to say, holy shit, stop was my exact quote.  Stop what you're doing, yeah.  And I go, what the fuck?  And what were you thinking?  You told me?  I forgot now.  We were looking at something and I was thinking about something else, so I was on overload.  But he admitted to me he can only think of one thing at a time and he had something in  his brain, so he didn't realize he almost fucking mowed down these two new mothers and  their newborns.  Wow.  Dude, it was close.  That would have been tragic.  Yeah, you would have liked it.  It was funny. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, huh?  But he finally admitted.  He goes, I can only have one thought in my head.  At one time.  He's so intense with one thought.  Yeah.  I forgot what it was because it was something so stupid to begin with.  Yeah.  Would you like an omelet?  No.  See, that's in his head right now.  He can't, he cannot continue.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  I, no, that means nothing.  What do you mean it means nothing?  We're individuals.  Individuals.  Individuals.  Opie Radio on YouTube. 
[01:08:30]  No, but you're not hashtagging.  You're just promoting usernames.  Yeah, but that brings people to that shit.  You got a hashtag.  Yeah.  We don't believe in Opie and Anthony anymore either.  I do.  We don't believe in.  Remember when.  We have no belief.  I don't believe in the Beatles, whatever the fuck the line was.  What was the line from the fucking.  Yeah.  I don't believe in.  What was it?  Any fucking Beatle fans out there?  I don't believe in Beatles.  I don't believe in.  I don't believe in.  Miracles?  No.  It was John Lennon.  I believe in miracles.  When he got so fucking pissed off. 
[01:09:00]  I don't believe in.  Denver Pest might have it.  Is it called Opie Lost His Fucking Mind?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost over.  It's almost over.  Yeah.  So you don't want to hashtag Opie and Anthony?  I don't believe in Beatles.  I just believe in me.  Management is Yoko.  I don't believe in Beatles.  I just believe in me.  Where's the quote?  1986.  Oh.  86?  Oh, he's referenced.  Wait a minute.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Wait.  He said it before he died. 
[01:09:30]  That was when it was referenced.  You Googled it, didn't you?  No, it's not when it was referenced.  You Googled it.  It was in a song that Lennon did before he died.  I saw you when it was referenced.  His first Google.  Oh, shit.  His first Google of the day.  Here's what Sam did.  What song was it?  God, I think.  Yes, okay.  God.  In the song God by John Lennon, he said just that.  How he doesn't believe in Beatles, he believes in me.  But Sam decided to read select words.  Yeah.  I didn't read that sentence.  It was referenced in 1986, Sam. 
[01:10:00]  In the movie Ferris Bueller.  Of course.  It was a kick-ass movie, though.  That was a good movie, Ferris Bueller.  Yeah, I still like watching that one.  Vince, good point.  I don't yell at my son at all.  No?  Nope.  You got time.  No desire.  Nah.  There's plenty of time for that to come.  Is that it?  If he's a bad boy.  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  If he's bad.  Talk to me in a year.  You don't yell at little Riley, do you?  She's going through a listening phase.  What do you mean?  That's a nice thing.  Where she's got to listen a little better?  Yeah, she can stand to listen a little better. 
[01:10:30]  I'm heading in that direction, too.  She can stand to listen a little better?  I totally get what he's saying.  How far ahead is she from my son?  How about a year?  She's like two years and three months.  Yeah, okay.  A little less than a year ahead.  What's an example of something she would do?  It used to be cute and stuff, but now you start thinking, okay, it's time for this kid  to start listening a little more.  What's an example?  I get it.  Don't stand in front of the refrigerator with it open. 
[01:11:00]  She knows not to do that.  Get in and shut the door.  That's what I would tell the kid.  Sit down and eat your dinner.  Oh, why?  She doesn't want to sit down and eat her dinner.  No, she likes to take a bite and then get up and run around in a circle.  That's dancing.  She does run around a lot.  Loves to run.  That's good.  I'm waiting one day for her to just headlong smash into one of my guinea columns in my house  because she comes very close.  I think she's hit her foot a few times.  Well, that wouldn't be nice now, would it?  It wouldn't be nice because I've seen Janine do it, and it's just embarrassing when she 
[01:11:30]  does it.  She's an adult.  A bigger child.  Yes.  She will run around and smash her face into the columns and slip on the floor.  She has listening problems.  She has listening problems, too.  Yes.  Oh, God.  All right, people.  So we're going to do some shitty dating contests soon.  It's going to be shitty.  It's going to be amazing.  Yeah.  Just based on the fact that our staff has put together this event. 
[01:12:00]  That's right.  We actually, Opie, we have had zero input on this.  Tell you the truth.  We didn't even pick the goddamn girls.  We stopped asking.  You stopped asking.  And then I would listen during the after show and be like, this sounds like something that  should have been on our show.  Well, that's what's great now, that there's the after show.  Because you guys, you're just like, yeah, whatever.  We could dump all our shit off on your hour.  That's right.  It's perfect.  That's why it's called the shit show.  It should be called the dump our shit show. 
[01:12:30]  You should call your show Staten Island because we're just dumping our shit.  You're fucking, exactly.  Yeah, but you know, we make it, we still make it entertaining though.  Because your leftovers are that good.  Sam Roberts, Fresh Kills.  Nice.  I like the name of that.  That's what it is.  That's good.  That's good.  It's good.  Occasionally, you could smell it from a few miles away.  Like, I'm smelling Sam's show today.  It really stinks today.  The wind must be blowing the right direction.  We're all talking in good fun, but you're a fan, right? 
[01:13:00]  No, I hate the Sam Roberts show.  We don't need that.  That's too late, man.  I know.  You already fucked up.  I already gave him a promo.  I guess, are we waiting for your bagel or should we break?  We can break and then when my bagel gets here, I'll eat it and then we'll just keep pointing  at E-Rock for more and more time until I'm done eating.  I need 20 minutes.  It's Friday.  We're here.  What the fuck more do they want from us?  I need 20 minutes.  A bagel. 
[01:13:30]  20 minutes.  Some people say bagel.  Bagel.  Yeah, I've heard that.  Bagel.  That's like Central New York and Buffalo.  I've heard people saying that.  Bagel.  I've heard people saying that.  What do they say?  A bagel?  I started laughing.  I thought it was hilarious.  They don't say that shit.  Hey, it's a bagel.  They say that shit.  They say bagel.  I heard that shit go down before.  Nope.  I did.  I was laughing.  Hashtag Opie and Anthony.  Hashtag.  No, that means nothing.  All right.  Hashtag Sam Roberts.  Hashtag Anthony Cumia.  Hashtag Sam Roberts.  Hashtag life from the compound.  Hashtag A-O-A-L. 
[01:14:00]  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Hashtag T-E-E-N-P-O-R-N.  What's that?  I just figured I'd throw it out there.  Teen porn.  Oh, nice.  Why not?  Iraq, you happy today?  Why?  What are you going to do?  Oh, if he isn't the hit dog, then you go to pet and it winces.  But Iraq can't read a room ever.  No.  Obviously, we're all just bonding.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  You just said all these great things about the staff.  Yeah.  It's like, fuck you guys.  He's been hit too many times.  I know.  He's a beaten dog.  He's the puppy dog that's been hit too many times.  And you really are feeling like, no, come here.  I want to pet you.  Yeah, you just reach down to pet him and he goes, ah!  He's in his cage with I will remember you playing.  He's in slow motion with his eyes are all teary.  His eye is poked out.  He's got no fur on his right paw.  Yeah, we're just bonding today, Iraq.  Iraq sits in a cage for the entire show, not getting the love he needs. 
[01:15:00]  He winces when someone tries to give him a compliment because he never gets compliments.  I'm missing an eye.  My ear has like a bite mark.  Yeah, there's a bite taken out of it.  Scott Shannon would adopt you.  Oh, shit.  A second.  Who else would adopt a Iraq?  A sex bagel?  Treat him better than how he's been treated here.  I bet.  Most radio shows have gone away.  Elvis Duran.  Elvis Duran would probably adopt you.  Yeah.  Seacrest would be like GTFO, Eric.  Oh, yeah.  Forget you.  Seacrest. 
[01:15:30]  He wants a puppy.  He doesn't want a whole fucking hound.  Exactly.  Old hound dog.  Seacrest is young and youthful.  You're not adoptable anymore.  No.  You really should be at a kill shelter.  I'm getting put down.  Well, Iraq's only going to get adopted by the old men who only have a couple years left to live.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we just want to, like...  Brucey?  Yeah.  Cousin Brucey.  Cousin Eric.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get you.  Hey, cousin.  I think.  Hey, cousin.  Hey, cousin.  He's here every Saturday.  He's the best. 
[01:16:00]  He yells cousin to everybody.  Hey, cousin.  How you doing, cousin?  We get it.  How fucking long are you going to linger?  We've prank called his show like four times.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  What did he do?  Dave likes to prank call his show and just, we, our game is to see how long he'll talk  to Dave for before, like, Dave just keeps going on and on with his story and then every  single, by the way, his character is Eric from Hoboken, and every single time he tells  the phone screener he wants one song and then he gets to the end of this long story 
[01:16:30]  and requests an entirely different song that they're not ready for.  Oh, because they were setting up during that time.  That's fucking brilliant.  And it makes the air?  Yeah.  Can I, I want to hear one of these.  I got a couple.  I want to hear it after the break.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  After the break, I want to hear that.  That sounds fucking funny.  Eric from Hoboken.  Because that guy's a legend in his own mind, man.  I want to hear this shit.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  He's the greatest.  Look at what just came.  My sandwich.  All right.  Now it's time to eat.  Now is it good?  Let me see.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:17:00]  No.  It's a little better.  It's going to be a little more toasty, but I'll live.  Kenny.  Look at Kenny's face.  No, it's okay.  That's not good enough for Kenny.  No, it's good.  You all right, Kenny?  You going to be all right with this?  No, it's good.  Well, the main guy made it.  Oh, yeah?  The regular guy.  Oh, okay.  That's good, I guess.  Probably made it like Pesci's brother made a sandwich in fucking casino for the cop.  No.  Yeah, you motherfucker. 
[01:17:30]  No.  No.  You're watched.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  I'm eating.  Did you purposely do that so I would lose my mind today?  No, I was just, I was very proud of the young lad.  He did a good job, him and his buddy, doing a little sports show.  Jesus.  And, yeah, I was just kind of happy for him.  Wanted to get it out there.  You can see the replay of it if you go to, just put live from the compound in Google,  and, uh, you can see my cousin and his buddy, uh, do their sports show.  Do you want to do the breezy call before break or after break? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, after break, because I'm starving.  Yeah, I'm like, and then these, uh, guys got something to look forward to after the break,  I guess.  Of course, they put it up on YouTube with pictures of Iraq.  To remove all subtlety from the Eric from home.  Oh, boy.  Who's also possibly a homosexual?  Oh, really?  Yes.  Who doesn't love it?  All right, we'll check that out next.  Hi, everybody, this is your cousin, Brissi.  Guess what?  You're listening to my cousins, Opie and Anthony.

[01:21:30]  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right, I'll just go for the part.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick. 
[01:22:00]  All right, that's a frog.  That's really good, Bobo.  Yeah, my dick.  I know, that's a frog.  I'm just trying to, yeah.  You shall die.  Shit.  For sure.  I'm on a mission on Times Square.  Wishing that a cop die before he reach me.  I'll look into that cop's eye before he duck caps.  Better pray for your safety and keep the gun off safety. 
[01:22:30]  The streets done razed me.  Ain't nothing changed.  It's still fuck you, pay me or else.  Yo.  And funny.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  Biggest dick in the NYC.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  It's what's poppin', yo.  You already know. 
[01:23:00]  You already know.  In the middle of Times Square, so multiply that.  These bundles of CDs.  One for ten, two for fifteen, three for twenty.  I sign autograph.  And plus, you take the picture with me.  Forty seconds.  You got forty seconds, cop.  Yeah, my motherfucking record.  I hustle hard right in front of virgins or the Marriott.  Cops can't stop us.  This is legal profit.  Yo.  Oh, for sure.  Oh, for sure.  And funny.  Guns blazing makes me so horny. 
[01:23:30]  Biggest dick in the NYC.  Guns blazing makes me so horny.  It's what's poppin', yo.  You already know.  You already know.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Bob Kelly in the studio. 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  Bobby.  Love Bob Kelly.  Why is this line ringing?  Line eight.  Ring, ring.  Hold on one second.  Who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Who's this?  And what do you got for the show?  Just listen.  Who are you?  Who is it?  Why are you on my phone? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You've never realized this, O.B.?  What?  What?  This is Cassius here.  This is how I've been listening for like two years.  Wait.  You somehow figured out.  You talked someone into putting you on hold every day so you can listen for free?  Did I just blow up your spot?  I guess so, man.  All right.  I'll put you back on hold.  Thank you.  Wow.  That's fucking brilliant.  There was a...  How did that guy talk someone into allowing that around here?  And it must have been a few people because other people screen calls and get through. 
[01:25:00]  Why is he running down the hallway?  Running down the hallway.  Oh, because...  What happened?  Because Troy puts him on hold and throughout his whole jurisdiction, that was a Troy thing.  So when I filled in for Troy, Cassius would be like, well, Troy always puts me on.  So I'd say, well, okay.  If that's the way it goes, then that's the way it goes.  But Danny...  We are using up one phone line so one listener...  So one listener can hear the show?  For free.  Danny won't do it.  Oh, Danny never does it? 
[01:25:30]  No.  I know who this guy is.  Oh, hold on.  Let's put him on.  Danny's got to be the prick to the guy.  I tell this guy every fucking day.  Yeah.  Now I'm out of breath because I'll just run around.  It's okay.  I say, look.  And I try to explain to him.  He goes, can I stay on hold?  I say, no.  Why not?  The other guy...  I say, look, because we have so many lines.  Let's say you guys bring up something like right now.  All the phones are, you know, go exploding.  And now a good call can't get in because it's fucking jerk off.  It's too cheap to get a fucking subscription.  He does have a valid point. 
[01:26:00]  When does that happen, though?  There's no...  What are you going to need all the lines?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, well...  Oh, I was kidding.  Yeah, I was kidding.  I guess you guys' show sucks so much.  When are the phones ever going to ring, right?  No, no, no.  You love it so much that you're on hold the whole show.  Yeah, no.  I mean, but obviously with eight other lines, Troy was able to keep interesting parlors coming  in, and then I would call in on another line.  He said...  You see the way he said it?  Yeah, he's...  This guy's a passive-aggressive little girl.  Troy was able to.  Bye, bye, bye.  I fucking told this guy.  I told him.  I said, look. 
[01:26:30]  I know a guy who sells satellite radio equipment.  I'll get you a great deal on it.  Yeah.  Give me my fucking phone line back.  So what does he do?  Basically, in a nutshell, by calling in, he's told me in so many words to go fuck myself.  He's going to call back and stay on hold for the rest of the show.  If I bought one yesterday, I still have to wait a few days for it to show up.  No.  You're such a...  Dude, you're a jerk.  That's what you are.  You're a jerk.  I'm not.  You're a jerk.  Get off the phone.  Pay for it.  Just get off the fucking phone and get a goddamn satellite radio account. 
[01:27:00]  It's not hard.  You're the only jerk-off who has to call and sit on a fucking hold line to listen to a radio show.  It's ridiculous.  Well, since I'm the only one, it doesn't really create any problems.  I love this guy.  This guy's such an asshole.  This guy's...  He has an answer for everything.  He really does.  It's like talking to my wife.  Shut up, you cunt!  Yeah, it's because he's a fucking woman.  He's a passive-aggressive woman.  He's all right.  Let him listen.  It's a good deed.  You guys do a lot of hard shit to people.  Let the one guy listen for free. 
[01:27:30]  Yes!  Plus, he has no legs, dude.  He has no legs.  How do you know?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to help the guy out.  Trying to make him seem a little more pathetic.  And why would it matter?  Yeah, why would it matter to you guys?  No legs to you guys would matter.  And you know what the best part is?  He's got a smartphone, too, but he's too cheap to get the app.  To get the app.  The app is awesome.  It's not that.  It's a Windows phone.  I can't get the app for it.  I already tried.  Oh, wow.  That a shame you picked a shitty phone.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  I would get the app if I could do it. 
[01:28:00]  I really would.  But why did you tell Danny to go fuck himself by calling back?  I didn't.  I mean, like I said, no offense intended.  Even if I bought the thing yesterday, I would have to wait a few days.  Why do you think that this is an appropriate means of listening to this radio program?  It's not a matter of appropriate or honest.  Hey, cock face, let me tell you something right now.  Right now, all the phone lines are lit.  So by you staying on hold, you're taking away someone else's chance for a phone call.  Are you saying we need his phone line now?  Yes, absolutely. 
[01:28:30]  There's no such words.  Thank you.  There it is.  Let me say hi to Seth in Illinois.  Seth.  Poor Cassius.  Yeah, phone lines are lit because people want to call you a prick.  Who, me?  What?  What the fuck?  Where's that going from?  Why am I a prick, sir?  Well, not everybody has a smartphone or the money to pay for a serious thing.  So you should all just call the show and stay on hold and listen to it?  What are you, a fucking retarded person?  Troy did it for me for like a month.  Well, you know what?  I guess Troy's a nice guy because obviously Troy seems to think that you don't have... 
[01:29:00]  That this fucking show doesn't need phone calls.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm talking.  We don't need good calls as long as everyone can hear the show.  Right.  Do you understand?  This is why you don't do nice things with people because Troy did this with people like  Robin Hood and they're all throwing him under the fucking bus right now.  Now Troy will probably be fired for this.  Here comes Troy.  We are uncovering some shit today.  Here comes Troy.  Yeah, move the fuck over.  It's Mr. Generosity, Troy Kwan in the studio.  Mr. Drug Dealer.  What's up?  Yeah, give him a little taste for free. 
[01:29:30]  Give him a little taste.  No, I understand.  And I would tell these people, hey, look, if the phone lines light up, I have to drop you.  And they'd be like, okay.  So Danny handled it very mean when I said it.  I missed you.  One time very nicely just to say I'm on my way to work.  The show had 10 minutes left.  No, it doesn't matter.  The phone lines are for the show.  They're not your convenience so that you could listen in a pinch.  Somebody's booking for a promotion here. 
[01:30:00]  Let's say hi to...  Yeah, right.  Let's say five years I've been booking for it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Seth in Illinois is on the line.  And let's say hi to...  Oh, Cassius got through again.  Cassius!  What's up, Cassius?  Hey, Troy.  I mean, I really...  I hope...  I hope...  I didn't...  Never meant to cause you any problems over there.  I didn't...  Me neither.  I'm not in, bro.  It's not a problem for me.  And didn't when I tell you, Cassius, you'd call in another line, and I would say, look,  you can only be on one line at a time?  Troy's doing some Fight Club shit, man. 
[01:30:30]  No, and he...  No, and for Troy...  Yeah, of course.  And then I would hang up on the first line.  And then I would just stay on the second line.  And wouldn't I tell you that if the phones lit up, I had to drop you?  Yeah, every time Troy put me on, he would say, look, if it gets too busy, I'm gonna let  you go, but I've listened for three hours on hold.  Everybody, if you don't want to pay for this service, just call the show.  Just call the show and say, hey, can I listen on hold?  And then you can just listen for free, and you never have to pay for the show ever again.  It's a great deal.  It's a great idea.  Before I started doing that with Troy, I had a serious subscription, and it fucking sucked.  Hashtag listen for free. 
[01:31:00]  Wow, we're uncovering some stuff.  Well, Troy is a sweet boy, though.  He's a sweet boy.  Aw, Troy, you're a sweet boy.  Well, thank you, sir.  He's a gay-looking pompadour.  Well, all right.  That's fine.  That's what you get for being nice to these guys.  Yeah, yeah, same.  That's why people aren't nice.  You gotta realize, you just can't be nice to these people.  How does it stay up?  I'm gonna put Seth, and I'm gonna put Cassius on hold.  There you go.  Cassius is back on hold?  Why not? 
[01:31:30]  No.  Let him listen.  Not a good shit.  No.  I really do get fascinated at that hair, dude.  It's like...  I hope you don't get a hold on.  Just don't wash it.  Just let it go.  You don't wash your hair, and it stays up like that?  Like once a week, yeah.  How long does it take to do your hair?  I just get up and go.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  Swear to God.  Not with that.  I just put some shit in it and then go.  It's real simple and easy.  Wow.  Hair tips.  Yeah.  Do you want to make out with Troy?  No.  Apparently Troy's trying to pick up guys on the phone lines. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, I'll do you a favor there, fella.  Hey, man.  You know, just trying to help some people out, you know?  You know the alley between Sam Ashes?  Meet me there at 1035.  This is a guy.  Al in Ohio.  Al.  Al.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, a local Cleveland radio host.  His show just got canceled, the morning show, because he was letting people stay on hold.  And the mics in the studio were actually live to people on hold during commercial breaks. 
[01:32:30]  So they got like over 80 hours of footage of this guy like trying to get people fired  and talking, saying racist comments.  And he gave it to another Cleveland radio host.  Ah, Satan.  He was being nice and putting people on hold.  Didn't realize that mics were live for the phones.  I don't say shit in here when the mics are off, because I know they could listen to everything.  Oh, my goodness.  We learned the hard way at AAF.  They did the same thing.  We had a fucking general manager at AAF, Bruce Mittman. 
[01:33:00]  He doesn't let us in on this.  He could dial the studio at any time and hear what me and Ant were talking about.  And here's me and Ant discussing how we're going to fucking hold them up for money during negotiations.  And he's on his way home to fucking Newton, Massachusetts every day, dialing in the microphones  and listening to what we were saying when we weren't on the air.  He had to dial a number, hold the phone up to his ear, and he could hear everything that  was going on in the studio.  These motherfuckers.  We found that out.  Wow.  We literally, not a radio bit, we broke into the phone closet and ripped the fucking wire 
[01:33:30]  out.  Every day.  For that line.  Every afternoon.  Every, every, yeah.  Every afternoon we ripped the wire out.  And he couldn't call us on it.  Because then he would know that we know.  That we knew.  And we could tell everyone else.  Right.  Some tapes they have had people calling in and telling them about the problem and warning  them on the tapes.  Like, you can hear, like I listen to some of the tapes of the recordings.  You can hear somebody calling and say, hey, we can hear your mics on the commercial break.  And they're just like, oh yeah, okay, whatever.  And just pass it off.  Oh, I would love to hear those tapes. 
[01:34:00]  We had another guy at NAW and he now works at Sirius XM, this cocksucker.  He fucking, he would tape me and Anthony when the mics weren't on either.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the production room.  And we were in the middle of a massive lawsuit and this cocksucker, and I never forgot, and  I still fucking hate your guts as you walk down the hall trying to wave to us, go fuck  yourself.  No, he's not there now, Bobby, but he does.  But this guy was basically wiretapping me and Ann trying to get info for this big, huge  lawsuit that was going down.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  And he doesn't think we know.  Trust me, Mark.  We know you cocksucker.  So stop with your trying to like wave like, hey, we used to work together.  No, go fuck yourself, you little rat.  Jesus Christ, you just turned into a mafia guy.  Huh?  You just turned into a mafia hitman.  Go fuck yourself, you little rat.  Oh, I got a hit list.  I love it.  No, man, because I didn't know when I first got on the radio, I thought when you turned  the mic off, it was off.  Yeah.  But these things, you know, someone is listening somewhere when we're not on. 
[01:35:00]  These days, everything's networked together.  You know, it's all, everything's digital.  I mean, you could be on another floor in this building and probably tap into these mics.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  That's pretty amazing, Luke.  I don't say shit.  I just passed notes to Ant did that because that's back in the day technology.  That's like spy shit.  You had to go into a phone.  A phone line is some crazy shit.  What was that?  Like 86?  No, I'm kidding.  Jesus.  No, that is, but that was like kind of like spy shit back then.  You remember that, right, Ant? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  That prick.  And then, of course, they couldn't use the tapes in court.  Nah.  You guys should have just kept talking but saying shit that would have helped you.  We didn't know at the time.  No, instead of ripping the court out.  On both cases.  Instead of going in, just keep, you know, they do that in the movies where they just lead  them down another road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kind of.  Just get that fat.  We're going to meet.  Just say, hey, we're going to meet her today at three.  Throw out a red herring.  And have Fatso just show up there.  We weren't smart enough back then.  But Bobby's in studio. 
[01:36:00]  Very happy.  What's up, guys?  And I want to start by saying that, fuck, you got to yell at Bill Buckner on Curb Your  Enthusiasm.  Yeah, that was.  You didn't even tell us you were doing that.  I did it last year.  We did it.  That's a year ago already?  Well, yeah, something like that.  I don't know when the fuck it was.  Turnaround is ridiculous for television, isn't it?  For some HBO shows.  But here's the deal.  It's all fake.  It's all a lie.  It's a fucking job.  Yeah.  You know, I showed up. 
[01:36:30]  I was so excited.  I mean, it's Curb.  It's fucking great.  And what's his name?  The big guy there.  Jeff Garland.  Jeff Garland.  Sweetheart.  Yeah.  Sweetheart.  Saw me in Louie and got me the audition, whatever.  Basically, kind of got me the part.  I remember when he came up to you at Caroline's.  I just happened to be there.  And he's freaking out.  Like, you're so good on Louie.  Right.  That's why I got the audition.  And he pretty much probably said, just let the guy do it.  I think I tanked the audition. 
[01:37:00]  I was supposed to audition for another part.  Wow, really?  For a plane scene.  And I just, you go in the thing, you just improv the thing.  There's a line.  That's the audition.  You get one line and you go in with everybody, Larry, everybody.  And they go, okay, go.  And you got to, I hate pantomime.  I hate fucking improv.  You know, fucking improv, man.  And you start yelling and screaming and it's too much.  Bring it down.  And then it's too little.  Bring it up.  And you know, fucking whatever.  I bet you direct me.  That was, whatever. 
[01:37:30]  I got the part.  But we go down and they literally said to us, they go, every, we start up, me and the  other kid, the redhead, he's a comic too, hilarious guy.  And we start out yelling at him, but saying mean shit.  You know, like saying, hey, you shit dick.  Hey, Buckner, you fucking cunt hole.  And being from fucking Boston, you must have like really put emotion into it.  This is my dream.  Right, exactly.  It could be your number one dream.  Someday getting to yell at Bill Buckner.  My son, if I have a son, if my wife's eggs aren't dead, because I think they are, because 
[01:38:00]  we've been trying for a year and it fucking won't happen.  We just got a period again Friday.  If, if that's not the case.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sick of trying, Ope.  I'm sick of, my whole life I wore a rubber and I, and I, you know, I get pulled out and  I got nervous and it's one day, one second of a day in a month, her fucking dumb egg 
[01:38:30]  can accept my shit sperm and a fucking kid.  Now I want a kid and I can't have one.  Do you have shit sperm though?  I don't know.  No, I doubt it.  Have you guys been checked out?  I got a lot of jizz.  I got a lot of jizz.  Like I have multiple orgasms.  But you got to make sure your sperms are swimmers.  I'm just listening.  You got to make sure they're swimmers.  I'm making sure they hear it out there.  Yeah.  It's a good line.  They got to either be swimmers or some, some of them, they don't have tails.  Oh, that's sick.  How do you know?  What do you have a fucking microscope in your fucking house? 
[01:39:00]  I've seen, I've seen that when, when my, when my fucking, when my ball and chain wanted  to fucking get a pregnant and I must thank, thank the Lord Jesus Christ that he never  ever let one of my fucking spermatozoa smash into one of those fucking eggs and make a  baby or I'd still have to have some type of contact with that ex-wife of mine.  Holy shit, can you imagine?  Oh, Christ almighty.  And he would be at an age where he's maybe starting to be cool where he could be hanging 
[01:39:30]  out at the compound.  You know, she'd be yanking him out of your fucking house.  Every day.  Man, man.  Using the kid against you.  Oh, like, I'm coming to pick him up.  You know what it would be?  Yeah, fuck you.  Yeah, I got one of your whores raising him.  Yeah.  She'd be at the party though.  No, she'd, she'd be there.  Like, you'd go to the party and she would have some little corner, her table, where  she would sit.  No, because she'd, by the time now.  Go home to your ready-made whores.  It'd just be awful.  Who's that?  That's an ant-ex wife. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, the ex.  He's still got to deal with her because of the fucking, you know.  Your son be sitting there with her.  You stay here with me.  Thank God.  Well, at this point, we looked at our sperm once and, yeah, they're rocking and rolling.  I took a test.  In each other's palms?  Yeah, yeah.  In our mouths, we tasted it.  I licked his and I realized there was movement in my tongue.  Yeah, you could taste the movement.  That's exactly what happens.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  I can't believe it.  You know, what you do is you put it in your mouth, you snort it up a little bit, and  because your nose is so sensitive, it will feel them moving around.  Oh, it'll think it's the fallopian tube and try to swim up it. 
[01:40:30]  No, so they checked mine out.  I actually went to, like, a fucking doctor and, you know, they checked it out and said,  oh, yeah, you're fine.  And, you know, but what the ex didn't know was that I was fucking faking that I came  inside her and then pulling out and jacking off in the toilet.  Really?  In the bathroom.  Yeah.  In the toilet?  You faked an orgasm?  Oh, I would do it all the time because I was like...  Can I ask you, could you use me a favor?  How would that go?  It would be just a disgusting display of tense muscles and all moaning. 
[01:41:00]  Like how?  Can you do it for me?  No, I really can't.  And some, like, you know, grabbing and kind of fucking, you know, that little twitch thing.  You flex your arms?  Yeah, yeah, shit like that.  Did you make your legs into steel?  And then, oh, and then, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.  And then you roll off after a while.  You gotta lay there for a little while still inside because you gotta let her think that  all that cum is going where it's supposed to.  Right.  If you just pull out and there's nothing there, then you're fucked. 
[01:41:30]  So you gotta sit there and be like...  And then you go and, you know, drop the kids off in the fucking toilet.  You gotta cook a ham and then leave it in the...  Or a roast beef and leave it in the fridge.  You know that jelly that foams around the side?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take some of that in your hand.  Slap it in there?  Slap it on the sides.  Slap it on the sides.  That might have been a good idea.  Slap it on the upper thighs.  Yeah.  As you're pulling it up.  Because she knew, like, when she was ovulating.  So that's when I did the fake thing and stuff and was like, you know, fuck this shit. 
[01:42:00]  Thank God, man.  I ain't gonna...  Because I knew damn well I didn't want a fucking kid with her.  That's for sure.  But more importantly, Bobby's been trying for a year and it's just not happening for the poor man.  It happened once.  Yeah.  And little sucker didn't hang on.  What happened to him?  He just said, fuck it.  I can't make it, Dad.  Aw.  Aw.  Did he talk to him?  No.  How long?  I guess that happens...  Not that long.  I guess that happens a lot, though.  Oh, yeah.  They say it does.  It happens a lot.  I'm sorry for bringing miscarriage to the show. 
[01:42:30]  I apologize.  So you're not gonna be a father, but let's hear about Curb Your Enthusiasm.  So anyways, you get on the fucking set.  I'll adopt.  I can't wait to get one of those little black babies.  Oh, yeah.  What would you adopt?  A black or an Asian.  Yeah?  You'd go black?  I'd go black or an Asian, yeah.  I'd love to.  All white, black, or kind of like...  Yeah, like Africa.  That'd be funny to just see some pitch black kid.  He's growing up, and he just sounds like, dude, let me tell you something, dude. 
[01:43:00]  He's totally out of place.  I would go black where it looks like she could fit 19 bracelets around her neck.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Like that big thing.  Tribal black.  Lip plates and stuff.  Everything.  Is that the Tootsies?  All that shit.  Tootsies, yeah.  No, Tootsies and the Hutus.  Yeah, which one was...  They don't really gussy themselves up like that.  Which one's Francine?  She's a Tootsie.  Yeah, so you want a Tootsie.  They're tall, slender.  I'd help a kid out.  Wouldn't you help a kid out?  Tootsie. 
[01:43:30]  I would probably adopt.  Yeah, I'd adopt.  I'm serious.  Anthony should adopt.  Man, fuck him.  Why would I want that burden?  When everyone's power went out, I had fucking a couple of kids at the house and dogs,  and I was fucking freaking out.  It was nice, right?  No, it stunk.  Aided it.  I love how committed you are.  I don't want to fucking...  When it's raining out, I look outside and go, someone's walking their fucking dog right  now.  It ain't me.  I don't get walking a dog, especially in New York City.  What?  I don't...  Is that the little kid you want?  You have a dog.  You have a couple of dogs.  I have two dogs. 
[01:44:00]  I don't get that you have to leave your apartment to walk the little fuckers.  I get a dog in the suburbs where you just open up the back door and let him go.  But these people that walk around with their dogs and then have to put the baggie on  and pick up the dog shit?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what that must feel like?  Warm and mushy through the baggie.  The hot cock.  The hot cock.  It feels like a hot cock.  I'll tell you right now.  But the best, the little yip-yip dogs, they only shit little pebbles.  Yeah.  That's easy.  But I see these big fucking dogs laying pipe and then the owner's like, oh, fuck. 
[01:44:30]  And just trying to pick it all up.  There's a hot chick that lives down the street.  And she does that, right?  But she has a huge, huge dog.  So it's a pile.  And she, but no, but this asshole leaves it.  And it's the only big dog on the street.  You know it's her.  Her dog's huge.  And it's just, it's like just human shit.  Big fine for that one.  I can't catch her.  I want to catch her.  That's why I'd love to be like dog shit police.  Dog shit police.  You know what I mean?  Who's the dog shit police, by the way?  They don't have it.  They don't have it.  Who hands out the fucking big fine if they see you're not picking it up? 
[01:45:00]  I've never seen nobody.  One person get a fine for leaving shit on the sidewalk.  You have to call.  We have a run up the hill where I live.  And there's shit all over the fucking sidewalk.  Because it's an apartment that has mostly older people.  And they're not bending down as much these days.  So there's a lot of smeary shit on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  And I haven't seen one summons.  And where your building is.  It's on the way away from my building.  I've never heard of someone getting a summons.  I've never known anyone to get one.  That is an odd thing.  I've never seen it. 
[01:45:30]  Do you remember in the old days of New York?  I don't know if you remember.  It used to be just signs that would say, curb your dog.  They still have them.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a neighborhood thing now.  New York has neighborhoods.  Like Hell's Kitchen.  We're all a part of this neighborhood thing that I've never been to.  They have meetings and shit.  And you put up those signs yourself where there's poo trouble.  It's curb your dog.  You put up those signs.  But you didn't get a fine or anything.  The sign was there so that you would curb your dog. 
[01:46:00]  They would shit like in the gutter kind of.  And then the street sweepers, when they came along, would clean up the shit.  But people weren't curbing their dog.  Well, because there was a time where there was no law.  So people just let their dogs shit wherever the fuck they wanted.  And then they came over with that stupid pooper scooper thing.  And then someone discovered, fuck, I could just use a sandwich bag.  I saw a girl with a sandwich bag.  The feel of what that must feel.  Just the warm, mushy shit in your hand.  With nothing but less than a millimeter of plastic between them. 
[01:46:30]  Well, you use the doggy bags.  They're blue.  You can't see through them.  I saw somebody with a Ziploc.  And I guess she didn't have any doggy bags.  So she just grabbed a zip.  It's.  You fucking put a hand in.  You put it in.  You turn the bag inside out.  That's how you do it.  And then you grab the shit.  And then she fucking zipped it.  And some of the shit.  Oh, right.  Yeah, because you're never going to get it perfectly.  Oh, God.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:47:00]  It's almost okay until it's a bigger dog that's laying a lot of shit down.  And I don't know how they do it.  But Bill Buckner.  So curb your enthusiasm.  Talk away, man.  Curb your dog.  Curb your enthusiasm.  Very good.  But you're basically saying TV is like, what were you saying?  Well, it's a fucking job, man.  It's just that you show up, you shut your face, and you just do your job.  But for most people, what you're talking about is it's like this dream job that if you ever  attained it, it would be this miracle that nothing like you've ever done before. 
[01:47:30]  But what we realize is that no matter what job you get and how good you think it's going  to be, it's just a job.  It's a fucking job.  Yes.  I'm doing the fucking 2-2, the cop show with De Niro.  I have a couple lines a week, funny things.  CBS show.  One of the biggest shows they're putting out this year.  Huge, yeah.  This is huge.  And I'm still like, what the fuck?  Wait, what's your part?  What's your part in it?  I'm one of the veteran cops.  So you're on every week? 
[01:48:00]  So far.  Holy shit.  That's awesome.  Yeah, it's awesome.  But it's like, you know, you still, you know, you still like, what the fuck?  You sitting, I've been on the set for like three.  I mean, I love the show.  It's awesome.  Everybody's the shit.  When are we going to see it?  It's coming out in January.  But you still get, you get just fucking complacent, ungrateful.  I'm sitting looking down at a pit of extras in their fucking mid-30s and 40s.  Yeah.  Like, they're resting on a water bottle as a pillow. 
[01:48:30]  And I'm looking down, the piece of shit I am from my room.  And I'm still like, just ungrateful.  Because you have quarters.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  That's nice.  But anyway, on the fucking button thing, on the curb.  I want to interrupt just an observation.  You think as an actor like yourself, you get a, you know, something on curb your enthusiasm.  You're hanging with some fucking geniuses like, hey, man, we're all one and the same.  And there's like a little, da, da, da going on.  And hey, ba, ba.  Nope.  Nothing, right?  Nope.  Nope.  No. 
[01:49:00]  I truly knew what a nothing I was when Larry walked up.  And I was like, hey, man, this is great.  It's a real honor.  I'm really excited to be working all of us, you know, comics.  He goes, what are you?  I go, we're comedians.  He goes, oh, yeah.  Okay.  You know, I was just like, oh.  No.  But he's not.  But here's the thing.  He's fucking producing a show.  He's a fucking gazillionaire.  Yeah.  His second huge show. 
[01:49:30]  Huge show in a row.  And here's fat, bald, nobody.  Hey, man, it's an honor to be around you.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up and take your mark.  Just shut up.  But we're around that a lot.  What is wrong with him?  Why does he have to make it so difficult from where he sits?  I don't know, man.  Because like I said, it's a job, dude.  It's a fucking job.  I'll never understand that.  And then we go to.  You weren't expecting, you know, an invite to his fucking house or nothing.  But you thought at least.  I was.  Yes, I really don't mean. 
[01:50:00]  But you thought you'd have a little chemistry there, a little something like, hey, man,  let's make it fun for each other a little bit, right?  And you realize it's like, shut up.  I'll tell you when to say your love.  It really was.  I mean, this is what happened.  We start.  You know, it's an improv show, which is awesome.  But we start saying, you know, Bill Buckner's right there.  I met the guy.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  Great guy.  Still.  And the mustache is real.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a fly fisherman.  Huge fly fisherman.  We started talking.  Match the hat.  Match the hat.  Of course he's a fly fisherman. 
[01:50:30]  He gets away from everybody.  He had to move to the mountains.  No one's yelling at him.  Yeah.  No one's yelling at him in the middle of a river.  Fish just jumps.  I'm not taking your stupid fly.  And then, so then they go, all right, listen, you guys just go.  You're going to yell.  We're going to walk by.  Just yell some stuff at them, you know, whatever.  So we start the action.  They walk by.  And, you know, the guy next to me, ah, you suck, you asshole.  And I'm like, fuck you, Buckner, you fuck. 
[01:51:00]  And they immediately, you know, someone comes up.  Hey, hey, you guys, can you just bring it down a little bit?  Don't say fuck you.  Don't say fuck you.  Fuck, fuck.  Don't say fucking asshole.  So we're like, okay, okay.  Because you don't want to fuck up.  I mean, you know, it's curb your enthusiasm.  Do it again.  Same thing.  Someone comes up.  Hey, can you not say fucking douchebag loser?  Are you supposed to yell good play?  Exactly.  Well, we don't know.  So can I explain and turn me on the episode? 
[01:51:30]  It's a great episode.  Basically, so people understand the scene here.  Bill Bunker is walking out with David, Larry David, excuse me, out of a hotel or something.  And you guys just are two New Yorkers on the street.  Boston fans.  Boston fans.  You got the Boston Red Sox cap on.  You're leaning up against the car.  You're like, holy shit, that's Buckner.  So now you're telling them what a douchebag he is.  Right.  Okay.  And they keep bringing us back.  So we're toning it down.  And now I'm getting a little fucking nervous because now your pizzazz is gone. 
[01:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, your confidence, your pizzazz, your swagger.  Dude, you're in New York City on a fucking hit show.  You're on Curb filming and they keep telling you what you're doing is wrong.  Yeah.  So you're fucking, whatever confident or cocky bullshit you had.  You're losing it.  It's fucking failing by the second.  Right?  So then finally I'm sitting there going, you know what, dude?  Fuck this.  Think.  Think.  Think.  Think.  I finally, all right, I got it. 
[01:52:30]  I know a couple things I'm going to say.  What's his name?  Action.  What's his name?  Buckner and him walk by and he just happened to say to me, Larry David walks in.  Why don't you get a life?  After the other guy said something to him, he looks at me, he goes, why don't you guys  get a life?  And it just came to me.  And I go, why don't you get a time machine?  Go back to 86 and bend your knees, you loser.  It's fucking hilarious.  Great line.  Yeah.  I almost didn't wait till they said cut. 
[01:53:00]  I almost went, did you hear that?  Yeah.  That was the shit that came out of me.  I was so excited.  You know what I mean?  It's a great line.  Not only is it not, hey, fuck you, a couple liner or a one liner, that is like a fucking  sentence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of magic.  Yeah.  That came out of, I wanted to go hang out with fucking Wayne Brady and Greg Proops and  fucking, you know what I mean?  You see a whole career of improv ahead of you now.  I was like, wow.  And people come up like, wow, dude, that was fucking great.  Did you think of that?  I was like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  No, someone just handed it to me.  Yeah.  And I was like, that's, that they use, that's it.  It's got to be.  Fucking use.  They got to use that.  I'm not kidding.  I get to hit my wife.  I wrote that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I get the old nudgy nudge.  Mine, mine.  You're like, that was funny.  Oh my God.  I fucking did that.  Yeah, yeah.  And then bring it up 30 more times for the next 10 years.  But so then we, we, they're like, all right, cool.  We got enough of them.  And they kept bringing us back and back.  And I'm like, that's a nice one. 
[01:54:00]  It's not too mean.  And then they go, all right, this is the last one.  And the kid next to me, the redhead, who's hilarious.  They've been pulling us back the whole time.  Don't, don't say fucking loser.  They didn't want any of that shit, right?  So then they go, they were action.  And Bill's walking by.  You forgot to mention, sorry, that they said this is the last take.  This is the last one.  And they go, action.  And this kid, the redhead dude goes, I, fuck, I forget it.  Why am I forgetting his name?  He goes, he goes, hey, hey, Buckner, go fuck your mother. 
[01:54:30]  I'm not, he, the air on the streets of New York City was, was, it just vacuum sealed out.  I spucked his head.  I saw it just go down.  His head went down.  And then he just started going, nah.  Why?  Like, what the fuck?  It brought back 86.  Because he lived through that for real.  And he said it with the Boston accent.  Yeah.  Buckner, go fuck your mother.  Fuck your mother.  And then all of a sudden, Larry's just like, no, no. 
[01:55:00]  Why would he say that?  Why?  Cut, cut, cut.  But he would say that.  Like, come on.  Yeah, man.  I mean, Larry says some fucking harsh stuff.  Some harsh religious stuff.  But here's the thing.  And that's exactly what a Boston fan would say to Bill Buckner.  But I don't think they, Buck, he's still fucked up about it.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah, dude.  Dude, when I walked up to him and I had the Boston hat on, he was ready to fight.  Yeah, he was ready to defend himself.  I think he's fought over the years over that.  Dude, he took a fucking Kempo karate stance. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  He turned sideways to make himself thinner.  I mean, it was, he was, he was, he's still fucked up, dude.  Let's think about that.  It's 86.  That's 25 years ago, right?  Yeah.  How many times do you think he's actually had to fucking fight over that?  You've got to think he's been in situations at a bar or something where he's like, fuck  that.  I'm taking a shot at this guy.  And he's not a fucking push.  He's a man.  He's like an old school cowboy man, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I always look at dude's hands. 
[01:56:00]  If their hands look like catcher's mitts and you know, they, they, they can open shit.  That's city hands, Mr. Hooper.  Yeah.  I think he likes being Buckner though.  What do you mean?  You think he likes this?  He doesn't like it, dude.  I'll tell you why.  No way.  He would have shaved that fucking mustache.  He's so recognizable because of the mustache.  So if you're a guy that blew it like you did in 86 and you, you're dealing with this all  the fucking time, why not shave the mustache?  So it knocks down how much you get recognized.  That's right.  He's got the exact same mustache. 
[01:56:30]  It's just great.  That was some fucking CSI fucking.  Yeah.  I really think in the end, a lot of these guys, me and I have talked about a lot of  these guys over the years in baseball have weird mustaches or like a Raleigh fingers mustache  or whatever.  Goose Gossage has a strange stache or something, right?  Yes.  Yes.  And these guys keep their shit because they want to continue to be recognized.  That's right.  Could you get rid of the picture there but leave the page up?  What's behind there?  It says top 10.  What?  I'll see what you did. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, boy.  No.  Where does it say?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It says top 10 what?  World Series Moments.  World Series Moments.  Okay.  Buckner error.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a big one.  What number is that though?  It's got to be number one.  No.  No, because I think Bobby Thompson's home run, I would bet money.  Here's the thing though.  We didn't lose the World Series because of Bill Buckner.  No, that's true.  We just didn't win it.  Yeah.  But wow.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I was in rehab. 
[01:57:30]  I was in rehab, okay?  Trying to get sober.  Great time to be in rehab.  We were all, I'm talking to all these fucking drug addicts, these juvenile drug addicts and  alcoholics.  And this was the only thing, our hope was fucking destroyed that day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were all, I mean, we had to have a meeting.  It was, oh yeah.  But they, you don't remember the broadcast.  I was actually doing radio back then and I was listening to the World Series and doing  my own fucking dumb little stupid radio show for CQ102.  Don't put yourself down.  Don't put yourself down.  And they were wrapping up the fucking game.  Oh, it was done. 
[01:58:00]  They were like, eh, this and that.  And I think Keith Hernandez said he was already in the locker room smoking cigarettes and having  a beer.  Oh my God.  They were wrapping up.  It was over.  Everyone knew that.  Yeah.  It was done.  Oh, you know what?  Fuck Buckner.  You're right.  Fucking cocksucker.  You just brought him back.  You just brought him right back to what he felt.  I was yelling at the TV like, fucking Mets, you choke team shit, motherfucking.  Oh, great.  Oh, just extend the bullshit a little longer.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, good hit.  Oh, thanks, Carter.  Great fucking little blooper and fucking.  And then they just kept building it and building it.  It was unbelievable.  It was like, oh no, this is.  Are you kidding me?  It was unbelievable.  I'm like, oh yeah, get our hopes up and then you're just going to fuck it up anyway.  They took away our shoelaces that night.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah.  They took away everybody's shoelaces in the fucking rehab.  Yeah, there would have been some suicides.  There would have been hangings.  Yeah, it was fucking bad, man.  It was bad.  Mayhem Miller is here.  Is he?  And Tracy Lords, I think, too. 
[01:59:00]  And I believe, yeah, we're getting backed up as far as breaks go.  That is what I'm getting from Sam Roberts.  So why don't we take a break?  Bob Kelly's here.  Bob, what are we promoting?  Anything?  You all good for the most part?  I'm in Vegas.  Go to my website, robertkellylive.com.  Robert Kelly, live dad cam.  Okay.  Bobo's, we don't need to promote.  But we do have Jason Mayhem Miller in studio next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[01:59:30]  I would be able to control the boner if this was more like expected to happen.  But I didn't expect you'd be here in studio.  What an adorable little boner.  This is a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Oh, I love surprises.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my shorts.  Oh, she's trying to look, trying to look at her.  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, Bobo.  I'm trying to control the boner here. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, it's so cute.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, pretend I'm your brother.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Your tweets excite me.  I'm trying to control the boner, the boner.  I'm trying to control the boner here  I'm trying to control the boner here  Control the boner bobo  Control the boner bobo 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:01:00]  Bob Kelly in studio.  Where's Mayhem?  Mayhem's answering the phone.  Is it Mayhem or Mayhem?  Mayhem.  Mayhem.  It's a different pronunciation depending on where you're from.  Jason Mayhem Miller in studio.  He's walking around the corner.  Yeah.  He's a big guy.  What is he doing, man?  Voss heard that I didn't have anything to promote, and he sent me his dates this weekend.  That's fair enough.  Where's Voss going to be?  He's going to be at Fanyu Hall at Motley's in Boston. 
[02:01:30]  Motley's?  How about me and you jump in a car and we'll go see Voss?  We'll go down and see Voss.  Want to go see Voss?  I think we lost Mayhem.  Can we go down and dress as firefighters?  By the way, we lost Mayhem.  What happened to him?  What?  Mayhem just ran to the kitchen.  He ran to the kitchen?  He ran to the kitchen?  Why?  I guess he needed some food.  He's a crazy person.  Is he really just answering phones during the commercials?  I guess if you're middleman, Mayhem.  Mayhem's not the average MMA fighter. 
[02:02:00]  Really?  He's not Fedor.  Let's put it that way.  Right, right.  He comes in here and he's a little crazier.  That's why I like him.  He's a little nuts and he's funny.  Can he give you a dead arm today and just punch you?  No, because he's got a fight coming up.  I don't want to fuck it up.  I don't want to be the guy that fucked it up.  I only have maybe a minute because he's coming back down the hall.  I want to know for real, am I invited to fly fishing part deux or not?  Yeah.  So when is it going down?  It's going down, I think, next weekend. 
[02:02:30]  If it's not next weekend, it's three weeks from now.  Let's go three weeks from now.  I got things.  I got to check on the fly fishing.  I think it's October 15th.  That would be perfect.  No.  That's the last week.  Oh, before that.  Are we going to get the Vietnam guy again?  No.  No.  And are we doing bed and breakfast?  No.  No.  We're doing the Roscoe Motel.  Fucking Roscoe Motel.  That sounds luxurious.  That's the place we were at last time.  That's right.  We're going to make it.  Fuck, we're not going back there, man.  There's a river right behind it.  Hunting lodge type thing. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, with the fucking mosquitoes.  No, not even, dude.  No.  No.  Old Indian guy.  It was horrible.  Mayhem.  There he is.  What's up, brother?  I'm here.  Mayhem.  Yeah.  I need some microphones.  You're wandering around the fucking facility, huh?  This is the city that never sleeps, and I am no exception.  I hear you.  What's with you guys?  I love this guy already.  Bobby said we would love you.  Bob Kelly.  Just trying to get through the weekend.  Through Friday.  Man.  Through this Friday.  That's all we fucking do.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:03:30]  It's Friday.  We just walk in here.  We bide our time until 10.  Sometimes you just got to just keep going no matter what's hitting you in the face.  Just keep powering through, man.  The week just wears on you.  You don't even care.  You don't even care.  You just forget about it, and you just get hype.  You just go, I don't care.  And then you're, well, it's Friday.  He's fucking right.  Yeah, right?  That's life.  That's the whole entire life.  You just got to power through.  I got a buddy.  He's a Marine.  He got a shot in his legs and then ran back and forth twice to go save his buddies. 
[02:04:00]  I shot through and didn't realize he shot through his legs.  He was just powering through.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's a real man right there, sir.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh, shit.  I would have lied down, hoping that someone's going to help me.  I've powered through pizzas.  I know.  When you put it in that perspective, I've powered through a couple of fat chicks.  Bro, we all have.  Come on.  We all have.  You've never banged a fat girl. 
[02:04:30]  Come on.  Oh, my God, I have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the time, I ordered one off the internet, and the picture was not to scale.  You know what I'm saying?  I was like, oh, what's wrong with me?  I'll admit this to you guys.  I feel like I'm your friend anyway.  I feel like we've got enough mutual friends.  You know, you just look down, and you're like, man, this is not what I signed on for.  But whatever.  Power through.  Power through.  You powered through?  Yeah, powered through. 
[02:05:00]  Put some pillows over the fat parts, just so her head's sticking out.  Is that what you do?  You're trying to airbrush her side with the pillows?  She was completely covered in pillows.  Oh, that's funny, man.  You don't mind a fat broad every once in a while, right?  I've had a couple of fat broads.  I had a girl.  They try a little harder, right, Mayhem?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  And I'll say this.  The vagina, very hot.  Yeah, yeah.  If you can find it.  It's got a lot of heat build up from the fat.  There's a lot of mush.  It's like the center of the earth, you know?  For some reason, it's really hot in there.  You have to have a body build to hold up her stomach while you eat her pussy. 
[02:05:30]  How fat would you go?  How fat would you go?  I'll go as fat as him, for sure.  Oh, man.  Plenty of Bob Kelly.  Oh, fuck it.  Fuck it.  Goddamn quick and good.  It was flawless.  You get a 9.8 on that one, you fuck sucker.  I'm sure it'll come back this way.  Fuck.  Are you into the Asians?  Everyone is helping us out with this interview. 
[02:06:00]  Everyone always says that.  They say fucking Mayhem loves the Asians.  I'm dating an Asian girl right now.  I always get it.  Ellis started that.  Thanks a lot, Ellis.  Oh, really?  So now every ugly Asian chick thinks she's got a chance.  You're like, I'm an Asian girl.  Yeah, Ellis started the whole deal.  It's just I've dated Asian girls in the past.  Don't get me wrong.  You know, I've never been that picky to stop the white girl.  But at the same time, Ellis really cranked that up.  He's like, why don't you go hang out with another Asian? 
[02:06:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  And now I knew what was going to happen.  Every damn radio show, I get asked that.  Oh, really?  The Asian question.  I don't care.  It's all right.  But you're in Japan a lot.  You used to fight in Japan a lot.  That's also a big thing, too.  I live in Japan.  There's a lot of Asians there.  Is Japan as cool as it looks?  Man, it's pretty awesome.  It's weird because you would think, everyone always says, oh, technology.  No, no, no.  Well, it's like all the old technologies they perfected.  Like, they don't have, like, not many people have cable TV.  It's all on a giant wire in the middle of the city. 
[02:07:00]  Like TV regular.  Like old school TV like your grandma watches.  That's what they got.  But they perfected it.  But done to a T, right?  Yeah, but they got it.  Like, you know, you watch TV on your cell phone on the train.  No one talks on the train.  And then when the train is full, they shove more people on there.  I heard about this.  Yeah, we've seen the pictures.  Literally, aren't there people jobs to shove?  Yeah, yeah.  They're like cops or something, but they shove people on the train. 
[02:07:30]  But weirder than that, though, because I was over there once, too.  It's, like, illegal to be loud in public.  Yeah.  Well, no, no, no.  It's very looked down upon.  DeMaham would be in jail.  Bro, I was, like, everyone was looking at me like they wanted to stab me with something.  Yeah, that's for sure.  We're watching the cops pack the people in a train, and they literally are shoving.  Well, see, you got to get.  Holy shit.  You got to understand the Japanese mentality.  I really enjoyed it.  I really like the Japanese mentality.  It's, like, I have to do my job really good. 
[02:08:00]  So everybody's got to be there on time.  So everybody shoves on the train like sardines.  Could you fucking imagine this in New York, though?  You'd have people punching.  There'd be a fist fight.  How many people are missing their stop when it's time to get off?  You can't get.  Yeah, how the fuck do you get out?  You can't get out of that.  You're right.  I didn't even think about it.  Please get off of here.  Sorry, motherfucker.  Sorry, unless you could climb over our heads.  I can't believe they got everyone in that train.  And he's pushing a dress in.  Like, all right, there you go. 
[02:08:30]  So, man, if there's a fucking train wreck in Japan, hundreds of thousands are dying.  Whatever.  Well, you guys might be interested in this.  There's one.  Sometimes during certain hours, there's women-only trains.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because dudes come up a field so much.  Oh.  I heard about that, too, yeah.  I know.  The Japanese, though, even their porn, it's just weird shit.  They're a little fucked up, right?  There's the one guy who just goes around pulling panties down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or there's a guy who jerks off with, like, he has a newspaper, and he walks up to girls, 
[02:09:00]  like, waiting for a train, and just jerks off.  And then right when he's about to come, he pulls it down and shoots it on their face.  And shoots it on them.  And then runs away.  Now, I've seen these things.  What?  I don't know how real it is.  Yeah, but everyone's in on it, Bobby.  I'm calling bullshit.  It's real.  I know.  Fuck, it's real.  I've seen some shit on Japanese videos where I'm like, obviously, I've never heard of the  word lawyer in Japan, either.  Because no one's suing anybody.  You can tell that some of those girls really just got jizzed on. 
[02:09:30]  There's no acting coach in the world that can teach you to act.  That moment of, what the fuck, it's jizz!  You just came on me.  Yeah, when you realize it's jizz.  Very dishonorable.  Speaking of jizz, something about mayhem, man.  I've never seen more fucking women trying to call our show.  Women don't listen to us.  Oh, women love mayhem.  Because I guess we're a piece of shit or something.  I did tweet the phone number, so maybe it's...  Well, we got Chrissy.  Chrissy, what's up?  What's up, mayhem? 
[02:10:00]  What's up?  What are you doing?  I've seen you on Salem last night.  Oh, yeah?  Was I looking hot?  Sexy as ever.  You are looking sexy.  Nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  You know, it's funny.  Man, so you just called up just to tell me I'm sexy?  I really appreciate that.  Pretty much.  I'm right on your stand-up all the time.  We call you sexy parents.  You like it all the time.  Yeah, we want a girl to, you know, do something for us today.  Can you shove anything in you? 
[02:10:30]  For the show.  For the show.  Us, these Thai girls are kind of wild, so...  Yeah?  What are you, a Thai girl?  Huh?  What did you say?  Are you drugged up?  I said, us, Detroit girls are kind of wild.  Oh, Detroit.  I thought she said Thailand.  Detroit.  So she's sitting in a broke-down house right now.  Thailand's more civilized.  She's going to burn down...  Jesus.  Don't you guys, like, burn the houses that are all broken down in Detroit?  Yeah.  That's all they're doing now?  Detroit had such a bad reputation that its city, within its city limits, there was so  many abandoned houses and poverty and everything, that they literally pushed the city limits 
[02:11:00]  in.  They redefined the city limits of Detroit so they could say, well, now we got less problems.  The city itself isn't bad.  But then there's this no-man's-land buffer zone of just burnt-out houses and shit.  From the Great White Flight.  It really is.  That's where it's from.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Great White Flight.  All the white people were like, you know what?  It was fucking gone.  See what happened?  The jobs are gone.  Later.  I don't think Chrissy's getting it done, so we're going to go to Kara in Iowa.  Kara. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey, there you go.  Will you stick something in you for mayhem?  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  We'll find one, though.  We're going to find one.  You watch.  The word is out.  How old is that?  The new telethon?  Yeah, the word is out.  I'm telling you.  It's going to happen.  Trying to raise money for your friend who got shot?  Yeah.  It's going to happen.  He's good, though.  That's the funny part.  He's like, whatever.  I'm good.  What do you got for mayhem?  I just wanted to tell you that I think that you're kicking ass.  And, well, you're pretty hot, too.  I got to go on. 
[02:12:00]  I heart you.  Thank you.  I also wanted to wish you luck.  Come on.  I do.  And I hope you're mad.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, I forgot to plug what I'm on here.  I know, right?  Make sure to watch The Ultimate Fighter premiering Wednesday at 9 p.m. on Spike.  That's what she's talking about.  I'm going to fight Michael Bisbee on December 3rd.  Bisbee, huh?  Yeah.  But it builds all the way up to that watching the entire season.  And, man, it's the best damn season you've ever seen.  That's ridiculous. 
[02:12:30]  That Ultimate Fighter is a great show.  Well, it's good this year because he's on.  You were in.  He was over at Showtime.  You were over at Strikeforce.  Yeah.  And I love Dana White.  He says, no, it's business as usual.  And then he starts handpicking the top guys from fucking Strikeforce.  I don't think that's what happened.  Because mayhem is one of my favorite.  You're one of my favorite fighters.  Not to suck your cock like everybody else.  I'll reciprocate.  You mean that?  You mean that?  You're not just saying because he's here?  No.  You've got to understand, he's fucking. 
[02:13:00]  Who's on your list, though?  You've got BJ Penn.  I like Mayhem's on my list.  Diaz is on my list.  I love Diaz, too.  I fucking love Diaz.  He's just like, he's just like, he's an enigma.  This guy is so crazy.  I'm like, what?  He's just nuts.  He's just like, do not come forward.  He's like, I just want to fight.  I'm like, all right.  He'll slap you in the face.  And then you bring him.  So you do triathlons.  And he, yeah, I love triathlons.  He's like the nicest guy in the world.  But he's fucked up.  He's so weird. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  But he's got, first of all, Mayhem's got the, he does the entrances.  He did them in Japan.  Are they going to let you do them in the UFC?  Well, you know, I can't do exactly like I did in Japan.  Japan, that was crazy.  He'd hire fucking these Japanese girls.  No, let me tell you what I did, okay?  Because I know what you're talking about.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I got so excited because they showed it on Fallon last night.  They showed me an entrance with, I got 20 Japanese schoolgirls and was dancing.  Oh, wow.  Okay, but really in my head, originally, I was like, yeah, I told the Japanese, the promoters, 
[02:14:00]  I'm like, hey, can you give me 20 Japanese schoolgirls, you know, and we're going to, I'm going to have them dance with me.  And they're like, oh, a Japanese schoolgirl.  Oh, no problem.  No problem.  And then they all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the day comes, they show up, and it's literally Japanese schoolgirls.  They're like 14 and 15, and then, like, my corner men are like, hey, what's up?  I'm like, dude, those girls are 15 years old.  Oh, damn.  They're literally Japanese schoolgirls.  Yeah, but it's okay in Japan.  This fucking entrance is hilarious. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  What a hot entrance.  I know.  Yeah, but it's choreographed.  You're a mad man.  He actually did moves.  No shit.  That's fucking cool, man.  Why not?  Yeah, it's fun.  I like that, but, you know, I'm an entertainer, man.  And, you know, the fight is part of the entertainment, you know, and I feel like the entrance is all of that.  You know, it's a whole package, man.  It's a whole shebang.  I don't want the fans to be bored for one moment.  I want everyone on the island.  But this is the thing, is if he went in, if he did all this horse shit, and then went in and got his ass beat, but mayhem fucking... 
[02:15:00]  Oh, and I did one time, a long time ago, I got my ass kicked.  I was like, man, the entrance is awesome.  The entrance is awesome.  The entrance is awesome.  I sucked.  As a fighter, you know, you put it all in the line out there.  Mayhem's one of the fucking toughest guys.  He's one of my favorite fighters, but you're one of the baddest guys out there, too.  I love you.  You win.  He fucking kicks ass.  And now he's fighting Bisbing, which is going to be a great fight. 
[02:15:30]  Everyone hates the guy, and I see why.  If you watch The Ultimate Fighter, you see why everyone hates him.  Like, he's a douche.  Is he really a douche?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I gave him...  I hope you kick his fucking ass.  I don't want to, I will.  But I gave him the benefit of the doubt, nope.  No, huh?  Douche.  Douche.  Did you get under his skin, though?  Oh, it was so easy.  Like, on the first episode, I started saying something.  Immediately, he lost it. 
[02:16:00]  He couldn't even pretend for one day.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he couldn't even pretend that I didn't...  A little sensitive?  Yeah, that I didn't bother him.  Yeah.  Fuck him, good.  Did you guys almost get into...  Did someone break a door down like they usually do?  Let me tell you.  Oh, you know what?  I'm not allowed to tell you anything specific, because the UFC don't say anything.  Okay.  But I'll say, yeah, okay, fine.  Doors left their hinges, and it got crazy.  Yeah, it got crazy.  It wasn't even...  After four weeks of shooting, I was like, that's enough crazy stuff. 
[02:16:30]  Like, we don't even need anything else crazy to happen.  And then, still, it happened.  This is the weird thing about Bisping, though.  The last time, he was kind of the instigator, and Hendo's a real quiet guy.  Yeah.  And then, at the end, when they fought, Hendo knocked him out so bad.  Yeah.  His toes curled like he was being fucked with nylons.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was out there.  And you'd think that he wouldn't do that again, just to save...  You know what I mean?  Because you're not...  He's dumb.  Just to save face, like you wouldn't be a dick again. 
[02:17:00]  Man, it's like you already watched the show.  I feel like you already watched it.  Bobby's a huge fan, man.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Are you going to tap him out?  Yeah.  I mean, I feel like I can beat him most everywhere, so...  Really?  Yeah.  So, I mean, we're just going to...  I'm going to have some fun.  He might not have as much fun.  I guess not.  Yeah.  Especially if you're beating his ass.  I know.  It's going to be great.  That's fucking cool.  Bobby was telling me about a fucking show you do.  Bully Beatdown.  Bully Beatdown.  Holy shit.  It's kind of refreshing to not come in and the guys don't know Bully Beatdown. 
[02:17:30]  Only you know it.  It's hilarious.  It's pretty damn funny, I've got to say, man.  It was a really fun thing.  For now, I don't know what I'm going to do with it, but we did it for three seasons on MTV.  And that show got...  It's like worldwide now.  Everybody...  I get weird accents going, I love Bully Beatdown!  I'm like, man.  Where the fuck are you from?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but it was a good concept and everything.  It was good to go right into the Ultimate Fighter. 
[02:18:00]  It really got me used to being on camera all the time.  Kind of like getting bits worked out to say funny stuff on camera.  Where did you find the bullies?  Where would they come from?  Well, they had some kind of casting process where they had people send in tapes of who's  the bully.  They had to get guys who would agree to it and whatnot to make it legitimate for TV.  Sure.  And you had to get tough bullies, too.  Yeah, yeah.  They had some dudes that would get some nerd in his basement.  Yeah, yeah.  You had to get the bigger fucking guys. 
[02:18:30]  The first season was the one which I liked where he used to show up.  Yeah.  He'd show up at their house.  He'd show up at their house.  At their house.  But it got a little dangerous.  He showed up at some rapper producer's studio and the guy was like, what?  And he holds up 10 grand.  He goes, 10 grand if you get into the ring.  And the guy was like, well, I want to just take that 10 grand.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, oh, shit.  I want to see you take it from me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They pulled out nines.  Buck, buck, motherfucker. 
[02:19:00]  Mayhem's fucking hand just slowly.  Oh, my God.  A bloody 10 grand on the fucking stoop.  He's got a red stripe on both sides of his head now.  Jesus.  That's a short episode.  This episode was only two minutes long.  And it is the series finale.  Yeah.  But he winds up.  He winds up.  Oh, man.  They wind up fucking beating the shit.  These fucking guys.  And it's almost like the beginning of the UFC where they were figuring out rules as they 
[02:19:30]  went along.  Your shows like that.  Smash their face in until.  Well, because the next season was a little more produced.  You can tell they fucked up on the first one a couple of times.  Yeah, the first one.  No, the problem with the first one is the dudes knew we were coming.  Right.  So they would think up all these weird things to say, like try to get.  So it just came off scripted as hell.  Uh-huh.  And people were like, it's fake.  Like, it's not fake.  Like, the dudes knew I was coming to their house or to their apartment.  You can't just go and assault somebody. 
[02:20:00]  So, yeah.  So everybody was coming up with, like, bits.  Oh, yeah?  Well, your head is like a skunk.  Like, I'm like, oh, really?  You guys suck.  Like, come on.  And so instead, yeah, we changed the format where I sat and interviewed the guys.  Yeah, which is, I think, better.  And that way, way better.  So that way they didn't have, like, it just came off more natural.  I'm just talking to a guy.  Right.  But he fucks with these guys so bad.  These guys are real tough Italian guys.  And he's like, he's like talking to them like he's kind of interested sexually.  And it makes them, it just fucks their whole manhood up. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, of course.  What the fuck you mean?  They take it personally.  And he goes, you got a pretty mouth or something.  I was like, what the fuck do you mean?  Any of these guys get a good shot in?  Yeah.  One of the fights.  Yeah.  One of the, yeah, that guy won the whole damn thing.  Wow.  One guy.  Won 10 grand?  Yeah.  Before the fight, I was like, I don't know, man.  This fighter.  Uh-oh.  This is a crazy match.  And, you know, the fighter still beat the hell out of the guy.  Yeah.  But the guy got all the money.  Like, all the 10 grand. 
[02:21:00]  You know, you make it.  It was crazy.  Damn.  Dennis the Russian.  Oh, you missed the one where the guy dropped the fighter with the right hand.  The fighter and then the bully.  The bully threw an overhand right.  It did a crazy one.  And just caught him.  And sat the fighter down.  He was like, oh, fuck.  Wow, really?  The fighter got back up and just kicked him in the head straight away.  I got the one I was talking about.  I was like, oh, man.  That's the one that got mad.  And then I was like, great.  I was like, great.  There goes my easy-ass MTV job.  Yeah.  I thought the season was over then.  Yeah, the guy got up and kicked him in the head. 
[02:21:30]  And you heard, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't kick in the head.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  We're actually watching a little bit of it here now on the intratubes.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I would assume the guy on top is the fighter.  He's a fighter, yeah.  He's a fighter.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  What move is that right there?  That's called smush your face in.  That's called the fruit basket in the face.  He does have his balls right in his fucking mouth right now. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  That had to hurt.  Oh, man.  The bully might go to sleep.  Triangle choke.  Oh, no.  This is like Thunderdome.  It's fucking Thunderdome.  Were you calling it shit?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, look at this idiot.  It kind of had that feel to it for sure.  And anyway, you know, really what the show was great for?  The one that show was great for was to kind of educate.  You know, see how it was like, oh, triangle choke.  Like, it's time to educate the kids on MMA, you know? 
[02:22:30]  Right, right.  Like, here you go.  This is a triangle choke.  This is an arm bar.  It kind of is very simple for people to understand what the hell was going on.  You know how to be really funny when there's a real school fight and make you sit on the  side like, look at that little pussy.  I know that there's some 12-year-old out there going, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, mayhem.  He jumps in in between rounds, though, and taunts the guy.  Yeah, it's the worst.  This guy's going to die.  The poor guy is, like, exhausted.  He really, every guy pretty much.  Mouth breathing, and you're just like, hey, dick.  You know, because, you know, what we do in the UFC is, man, it's difficult. 
[02:23:00]  You've got to train really hard.  No shit.  And everybody thinks they're a tough guy who can fight, and, you know, these guys get  a wake-up call after that first round, and then all of a sudden see, you know, oh, this  is real.  Like, this is hard.  The endurance factor has to be ridiculous.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  And it's crazy, because this season of The Ultimate Fighter, you know, usually they got  really, like, guys who are, like, 4-0, you know, in their fights.  Some of the guys in the new season of The Ultimate Fighter, they are, like, 40-2 or something.  Like, they already had a million fights. 
[02:23:30]  So, they're crazy.  The fights came off so good, because the guys have so much experience already.  So, it's pretty much, it wasn't like I had to go, I mean, I went in there and coached  them the best I could in a way, you know, that they could take some information out.  But at the same time, they already knew how to fight.  I didn't have to teach them how to do an arm bar, you know.  Right, right.  They already knew all the moves.  I just had to kind of school them in game planning, you know.  It was great to do this season of The Ultimate Fighter.  What's the weight class? 
[02:24:00]  This is the first time?  Yeah, it's 35 and 45.  Swinging from a rope.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Yeah, he has a rope that he swings into taunt.  To have the middle name Mayhem, you can really fuck up having that name, because if you're  not, if you don't have Mayhem in your spirit, it just sounds silly.  I can't help it, I'm stuck like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is fucking hilarious, man.  We got Melissa now.  We're going to try to get this done.  Melissa, what do you want to shove in your box? 
[02:24:30]  I would open it for you, yes.  Wow.  These girls, man.  Dude, how many times?  We never get this.  Nothing.  Look in the mirror.  I know.  I know why.  I'm just saying it never happens, and we're just commenting on it, friend.  All right.  Sorry, Ed.  It's okay.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not that fucking pretty either.  I'm on TV more than you guys.  It's all about the attitude, believe me. 
[02:25:00]  Melissa.  We don't want women just saying hi at this point.  I got what you call confidence.  We're going to get you a nickname, man.  Yeah?  Anthony the Savage Kumia.  No?  No.  Anthony, I have money in a big house.  Anthony the Huge Cock Kumia.  Well, I like that one, but that might bring on people, unwanted advances from certain gentlemen.  I heard you had a huge cock.  Yeah, exactly.  Melissa, are you going to do something today, or what?  Ooh.  I would like to. 
[02:25:30]  When are you coming to Virginia Beach?  Oh, boy.  I'll be right over.  I'm going to FedEx my dong.  Exactly.  What about, we'll try Karen in Tennessee, and then we're going to give up on this shit.  I don't even understand how this opiate Anthony vagina thing works.  How do you know that she's sticking it in her box?  We never do.  We know.  We're experts.  We can tell.  We can tell by the squishy sound.  I just assume, yes, it's happening.  Karen?  Yes.  Are you shoving anything in your box for me?  Wait, wait, wait.  Sounds like she's shoving a Barbie doll back in her box. 
[02:26:00]  Listen up.  It's a Ken doll, not Barbie.  Oh, okay.  You sounded younger, but now you sound like an old lady.  She went from sounding like a kid to an old bag.  Yeah, really.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  It's fucking Nancy Grace.  Tell us about Tot Mom.  Tot Mom.  Hot she is now that she doesn't have a kid.  This is why we don't get girls, by the way.  We just beat the shit out of her.  God, I fucked the shit out of that Casey Anthony.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I wrote a tweet about her.  I wrote a tweet that she needs to be murder fucked. 
[02:26:30]  Now, that's fucking, that's a fucking murder fucked.  I have a question, Mayhem.  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are we going to see some cool colors on your hair during the season?  Or are you going to just go and leave that secondary?  Before this boy dies of progeria.  Your voice gets weirder by the second.  What do you work, a helium plant?  All she wants to know is if you're going to put some nice colored dye in your hair. 
[02:27:00]  Jesus.  I don't know.  Undetermined.  I'll think about it because of you.  He's spontaneous.  That's what Mayhem is.  Right.  I have been a Bisping fan up until now, and I'm psyched about this.  Well, welcome to the good side.  I know.  The first thing, whenever I was reading, he was going to be the coaches.  I was like, oh, shit.  This is awesome.  I said, I'm going to make sure that I'm hot.  You have to relive it in real time.  I was like, oh, shit. 
[02:27:30]  This is awesome.  My husband was like, what's going on?  And then I went and baked some cookies.  And then decided to think about it some more.  I loved this girl in Maximum Overdrive.  Remember?  When she got married to that guy and they drove into that.  No, I loved her in Exorcist when she got the demons out.  I loved her.  I loved her mother in Poltergeist.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  Fuck.  We're on the same level.  We're on the same level.  We got to let you go.  You got a flight to catch them here?  Oh, yeah, I do.  You're a busy fucking man.  I am a busy dude.  But I always wanted to come on here, man. 
[02:28:00]  I feel like I've never got to come.  If you are ever in town again, please.  All right.  You are my people.  I'll call your people.  Yeah.  So you're going to win.  You're going to kick his ass.  December 3rd.  December 3rd.  I'll beat his ass.  Let me take care of that.  I'm putting money on the fucking fight.  I think I'm an underdog, too, which is great.  Yeah, it's great.  It's great.  So you'll be in New York to promote that shit, so you come back?  I hope so, yeah.  That would be fucking great, man.  I'm going to make sure that I come do a little tour.  I want to hang out with you guys, man.  Yeah.  I just like how immediately we were just starting to talk about banging fat chicks. 
[02:28:30]  All right, perfect.  I'm totally in my element here.  Exactly, man.  Yeah, you guys hang out for the whole show.  What are we promoting?  The Ultimate Fighter, man.  Next Wednesday at 9 o'clock.  So Wednesday coming up.  9 o'clock on Spike TV, man.  I'm so excited about it.  Thank you guys for having me on, man.  Thanks, man.  What a piss of you out.  You know what?  I'm following you on Twitter.  Fuck that.  I already follow you.  My tweets are pretty funny, man.  Anyone tweets, she needs a murder fuck.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:29:00]  I'm following her.  You've got to follow Mayhem Miller on Twitter.  It's M-A-Y-H-E-M Miller, obviously.  All right, we're going to break and get Tracy Lords in here.  Yeah, yeah.  And doing the Bobo rape contest.  Dating game.  Yeah, and then Bobo's coming in to do some shit.  And then it gets worse.  Mayhem.  Thank you, brother.  Later.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, let's give a big fuck you to National Grid,  who decided to turn on the power at Foxborough Stadium 
[02:29:30]  rather than the town of Foxborough itself.  You should be hung up like pigs and slaughtered.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to say fuck you to the guys  who keep playing the same fuck you line.  Stop doing it.  Change it.  Play something different.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to prime time Sam Roberts.  I'm so sick of hearing you during Opie and Anthony  and then your stupid shit show after.  I have to turn the fucking radio off  and your nails on a chalkboard voice, 
[02:30:00]  your smarmy, sarcastic, overly obvious sense of humor.  You have no fucking balance.  You're annoying.  You're a piece of shit.  I hate hearing you on the radio.  Shut the fuck up.  Damn fuck you.  Fuck you.  This fuck you is the Chip Chipperson.  I hope you fucking die.  I hope, uh, I hope, uh, yeah.  Fuck that one.  Fuck you.  This was out to my two ex-wife  that took everything.  My house, my car, my kids.  Fuck you, cunt.  Fuck you. 
[02:30:30]  I'd like to give a big F you to Danny Ross.  I don't know why I'm doing it.  I just don't like him  and I don't like his face.  Fuck you, Danny Ross.  Go to hell.  Fuck you.  Hi, I'd like to just give a big fuck you  to the executives at XM  who would stifle, slow down, or criticize the art  that comes out of this show as in Opie and Anthony.  Fuck you, dickheads.  Let them do their fucking show  and mind your own fucking business.  Fuck you.  I have a big fuck you to my ear hair  for growing every fucking day  and for my birthday last week 
[02:31:00]  I got a goddamn fucking nose and ear hair trimmer  for my family.  So, it's a fucking problem that everybody sees.  I have no fucking ear on my head.  So, fuck you, dear hair.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I just wanted to give a big F you to Troy Kwan  for not following his name  and that King Francia in the face.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Are you ready?  Here they come.  Opie and Anthony.  How you guys doing?  Get down. 
[02:31:30]  Okay.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I've got you all.  Come out.  Come out.  Come out.  Come out.  Smoke weed every day.  Oh.  Smoke weed every day.  Kiss my ass.  Would you shut the F up?  Fuck.  I'm not doing.  No, no, no.  You imbecile.  Stop.  Wow.  I thought you were a girl. 
[02:32:00]  You're an ass.  What the hell were you thinking?  How you guys doing?  You stink.  How you guys doing?  We suck.  How you guys doing?  Shut up, stupid.  Dop, dop, dop, dop, die.  No shoot times you can carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hay.  Had no dogs and he had no sleds.  But one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man.  Go.  He's mush and Eskimo.  So go, man.  Go, man.  Go, man.  Go.  I say, Oopie, what did you learn? 
[02:32:30]  The virus.  Serious.  Serious.  This is the Oopie and Anthony Show.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Bob Kelly on the show.  Mayhem Miller is an instant friend of the show.  Holy fuck.  I can't wait for him to come back.  He's fucking funny as shit and he can kick your ass.  He just walked out with a suitcase.  I go, what's in the suitcase?  A Japanese girl.  He goes, just her legs. 
[02:33:00]  Fucking great.  I want to thank Jason Ellis for turning me on to Mayhem Miller.  Fucking A, man.  Thank you.  This guy will be around for a while on our fucking show.  Sambo.  Sambo.  I was just here for when you wanted to start the next thing.  Where's Tracy Lourdes?  Yeah, what happened with Tracy?  I think she's on her way up then.  From where?  Downstairs.  Why is she downstairs?  I heard she was in the green room.  Maybe she's on her way from the green room.  Isn't the green room Iraq's office?  No, Iraq's office is taken by the lovely contestants. 
[02:33:30]  And my office was taken up by Bobo and his four Whoppers and a strawberry shake.  By the way, the prostitution thing we're doing with Bobo is now down to two girls.  It was supposed to be three.  But here's the no show.  Which one backed out?  These twats.  Why would they no show?  Yeah, but.  And why would they not let us know ahead of time so we could, like, get somebody else  in the place?  Now I'm pissed.  The two girls?  Yeah.  So much hotter than their pictures.  Yeah.  No, no.  This is nothing against the other two girls.  Right.  But why would you join us? 
[02:34:00]  The other one was the hot, hot one, right?  Well, maybe since the other two are so much hotter than their pictures, the hot one would  have looked like a skank in person.  You fucking bitch.  Like a skank.  You're a fucking bitch.  If you get scared, you gotta let us know so we can, you know, fill your spot.  What's the fuck?  Why would you sign up for something and then back out last minute and not tell anybody?  Not only sign up for it, but then when I let you know that you're one of the finalists,  say, cool, see you Friday.  Like a skank.  And they never showed up?  No. 
[02:34:30]  Never returned emails or phone calls.  All right, can we get this over the way?  I want to start my way down.  This is going to be a fun...  Now I'm fucking pissed.  No, you're going to...  When these lovely ladies come in, you're going to freak out about it.  I wanted to see what that skank looked like.  Sam, you know what?  Because the ass...  Remember, we were speculating...  She wasn't.  Sam, you know what?  Some mysteries.  I...  I...  I...  I'm pissed, too.  Why?  And I think we should cancel the contest and go home so we can fucking chill the fuck out.  Yeah.  It's probably a good idea.  You gotta relax, man. 
[02:35:00]  I gotta relax, man.  Don't let some skank put you in a bad mood.  Some skank.  Some skank is going to do this to this show.  I don't think so.  You want to go to the nap place today?  What's a...  Oh, the fucking place...  Let's go to the nap place.  What?  There's a place you can...  We know a nap place.  You can pay to take a nap.  Is it the one where you're in that...  Are you in that hammocky thing?  You're in a pod.  You're in a pod.  But they only give you a half hour.  It's like, I need a half hour.  It's a half hour.  It's going to take me a half hour to fall asleep.  Oh, that's bullshit, though.  As soon as you go in there, you're feeling the pressure, because you're like, fuck,  I gotta nap right now! 
[02:35:30]  E-Rock's got one of those punch cards for that place.  I love it.  E-Rock naps there?  Yeah.  If it's...  I don't know if it's the same one that I used to go to.  Used to.  There's no used to.  You don't know about the nap place there?  He goes...  He never heard of this.  He goes on walks.  E-Rock does.  Everybody knows this.  I've assumed this for a long time.  He goes on walks to last an hour.  I can take it from here, Sam.  57th Street, a nap place.  Ha ha, Sam.  E-Rock.  Yes.  You actually napped there?  I used to when we were at the 57th Street facility.  But were you able to nap in those pods?  It's not really. 
[02:36:00]  It's too quiet.  You jerk off in there?  It's a pod.  It's a pod.  It's a pod.  It's a pod.  Their business model sucks, because you sign up like, okay, I'm going to do an hour nap.  But then you lay in there going, it takes you 15 or 20 minutes to maybe fall asleep,  and the next thing you know, you're awake.  All stressed out.  It's for people that can fall right to sleep.  What if you fell asleep, and then you woke up 13 years later?  That would be fucked up, right there.  That would be fucked up.  That would be cool.  No, I could fall asleep very quickly.  You'd feel very rested.  Yeah.  People would come up, people are fucking on hovercrafts in the city. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's a hovercraft lane.  Oh, great.  I missed all that shit.  You know how Sam's fat and old?  Oh, God.  Still doing 20 shows around here for no money?  How cool would it be if you fell asleep, and then you woke up, and every fucking person  you ever knew was dead?  How fucking great would that be?  That'd be awesome.  Everyone you knew.  How great would that be?  You'd just start over?  Yeah.  And just start over.  Right.  But you had money, though.  You have to have money.  Oh, yeah.  You got your bank account, and it was getting its half fucking... 
[02:37:00]  You're not older.  And you're not older.  Right, right, right.  Now, that reminds me of, and I was just talking about this episode the other day, of the  Twilight Zone, where the thieves, they rob a bunch of gold, right?  And so they don't get chased around and shit.  They go into the desert, and this scientist guy designed this suspended animation chambers.  So they all go in the suspended animation chambers, and then they wake up, and they're like, what  the fuck, man?  We're like still fucking, you know, I don't even have a five o'clock shadow. 
[02:37:30]  This didn't work.  You prick.  We got all this gold.  We can't fucking use it because time didn't go by.  But a rock must have fallen on one of the guy's chambers, and they looked, and he was fucking  skeleton.  So like, holy shit, we are in the future.  So they gathered up all the gold, and they started trying to get out of there, but one  guy was really greedy, and he starts picking the other guys off, and killing them, and  taking their water and everything.  And it turns out to be the old scientist guy, and the young greedy guy with the gold, and 
[02:38:00]  he's making the old guy carry the gold, and he's going, you want a drink of water?  He goes, one drink, one bar of gold.  And he was a real prick the way he said it, and the old guy's like, this is my last one,  please.  He goes, that's the going rate.  And then he took it, and the old guy dies, and now he's the only guy, but now he's out  of water.  So he's all fucked up, and he winds up falling down on the road, and this space hovercraft  car comes by, and they pick the guy up, and he's dead.  He dies right there.  So the guy walks back to his wife in the car and says, she's like, what was that about? 
[02:38:30]  He goes, I don't know, he's babbling about something.  He was offering me gold to take him to the nearest city before he died.  She goes, gold?  Don't they know that that's been worthless for years?  God damn, are you still hot.  It's been worthless for years?  Because it can be man-made now?  See, they didn't plan on that.  Wow.  That twist that the Twilight Zone.  Hey!  Look at you!  Dan, I apologize, but she fucked up the punchline of your story because she just casually walks  in, and she's looking high.  There's no punchline in.  Tracy cannot fuck anything up. 
[02:39:00]  I always fuck up a few things.  She can't fuck anything up.  She's gorgeous.  Damn, Tracy.  You all right, man.  I brought my whip in case you guys are naughty, and I want you to read my legs.  You look really good.  Look at her legs.  Holy fuckaroni.  What does her legs say, Bobby?  The back of her legs.  Is that a real tattoo?  Stockings.  Is that real tattoo shit?  No, she's got stockings on.  Oh, stockings.  Tease me?  It says, bite me, eat me, whip me, tease me, and I can't go any harder than that.  You have great legs.  My lips.  I mean that in every way.  You have some great legs, too.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:30]  Goddamn, Tracy.  How are you guys?  We're doing good.  Much better now.  I think you've missed me.  Yeah, it's been a while.  It's been a while.  There's a little bit of frisk in their steps today.  Bobby.  Bobby's giving you a look.  What's going on, Bobby?  I know.  What's up, Bobby?  Because a lot of memories just came back.  I'm going to be still.  I feel like I just woke up being in the hospital after a car accident and I just remembered  everything from Mike.  Well, we don't want you to have a heart attack, so take a deep breath.  It won't hurt much.  Tracy, I looked up your age. 
[02:40:00]  What are you doing?  Oh, fuck you.  It leads to a compliment.  It leads to a compliment.  That's a bumpy road on the way to a compliment.  I'm a vampire.  I don't age.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  She'll just stare me down with dirty talk and you go, I got your age.  What the fuck, party pooper?  You don't even give me a chance to get the compliment in.  That's kind of hard.  Like, holy shit, do you look good.  Thanks, honey.  For what?  I'm not going to give her a number out.  It is the vampire blood.  What are you doing right? 
[02:40:30]  Look at us.  We look like shit.  I have lots of sex and I moisturize.  I do the same thing.  You know, and I record wild dance music and it keeps me boogging so I stay nice and thin.  Now, we've heard about this.  You've got an album out.  I've got a new single called Last Drag coming out on Sea to Sun.  Last Drag.  Uh-huh.  And tonight I'm going to be at the F Word Party at Splash.  And we're going to, I think, play it right here for the first time on your show. 
[02:41:00]  And I'm very excited.  That's pretty cool.  But it's cheeky.  Well, we can work it out.  It's cheeky?  It's cheeky, is it?  We'll work it out.  I'm in a cheeky mood.  We're going to negotiate a little bit.  We'll see.  Doesn't your hair look great, too?  Let's see what they make me do to play my music.  There's always a price.  I love her.  I love her.  She'll fuck around, man.  She's gotten more dirtier.  I love her.  You know, it's funny.  She's so sexy.  Yeah, I have.  Now I have a filthy mouth.  Yeah.  Then, you know, there were other things that were filthy.  Now I just talk trash.  Now you're just trash talk.  I love it.  I'm a trash talker. 
[02:41:30]  I love it.  Jesus Christ, that's great.  Any acting gigs?  What have you been doing lately as far as the big screen or TV?  Well, actually, I did a film called Excision that hopefully will get into Sundance this  year.  That would be amazing.  That would be very cool.  It's really fantastic.  Anna Limit Court is in it.  And some really interesting people.  My friend John Waters has a small part in it.  And he's brilliant as the priest in it.  And I'm playing the lead in it.  And so a lot of really exciting things going on.  But for me, what's really happening right now is I'm thrilled to have new music. 
[02:42:00]  It's been a moment.  Yeah.  Were you always into music?  Sorry?  Were you always into the music thing?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, my first album, A Thousand Fires, came out in 95.  But it's like I've dabbled and done soundtrack stuff since then.  That was techno.  This has more of a rock sort of pop dance edge to it.  Yeah.  And I'm signed to C to Sun Records.  And the support is there.  The artistry is there.  So I'm really excited.  Zalman King, we just signed him to do my video.  We're going to do it next week in L.A.  And, of course, he is of, I think he's such a sexy filmmaker. 
[02:42:30]  He did Nine and a Half Weeks and all of those movies.  So this is going to be a hot one.  What's the concept there?  Well, you know, when you play the song, you'll get that it has a party theme to it.  She is so good, man.  And what it's really about is called Last Dragon.  It's about being addicted to something that you know is bad for you, but you've got to  have it anyway because you crave it.  Pizza?  Yeah, Bobby.  Bobby.  I was thinking something a little more sexy than pizza, brownies, and cupcakes. 
[02:43:00]  Well, I can interpret it my way.  Yeah.  That's what you listen to.  That's the artist's thing.  Bobby needs pizza.  I mean, he could have said, like, cool whip or gone with me here.  Yeah.  No, he just said pizza.  Pizza.  Poor pizza.  Uh, jeez, Bobby.  You really took the sexy out of it.  You just took the sexiness out of your whole thing there, Tracy.  There are a lot of...  This is impossible with her.  She's got sexy all over.  You're tripping sex.  Yeah.  You know, it's...  Sensuality.  I'm not bad.  I'm just drawn this way.  Yes.  I swear to you. 
[02:43:30]  But, you know, there are a lot of fake Tracy Lords on Facebook and on Twitter.  Yeah.  So if my fans out there, I've been tweeting about you naughty boys all morning.  Who...  What's your real Twitter name?  The Tracy Lords.  The Tracy Lords.  Because Tracy Lords was unavailable.  Isn't that just a nightmare?  You can get it.  That's bullshit, man.  Yeah, it's total bullshit.  You gotta talk to the Twitter people.  They'll help you out.  I am the Tracy Lords.  Well, the Twitter people have just completely dissed me.  They haven't even verified my account.  They don't create them.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  I need to go in and give blood and be fingerprinted or something. 
[02:44:00]  And Facebook is the same thing.  Yeah.  You know, so you can find me and you can actually hear a snake and see like a little video clip.  If you go to C to Sun Records, which is C-S-E-A-T-O-S-U-N.com.  Oh, C to Sun.  C to Sun.  C to Sun.  So you can go there.  Ah.  Or you can go to TracyLords.com.  That's T-R-A-C-I-Lords.com.  Yes.  And you can see it there.  Or you can find me on Facebook on my fan page.  Oh, shit.  You're all over.  Well, you know, I am.  But there's more of me in some places than I would like. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  TracyLords.  The TracyLords on Twitter.  I'm now following you.  Oh, thank you, honey.  Are you the first porn star to actually cross over to mainstream and start doing, you know,  being legitimized?  You know, I think so.  Back when I was doing porn in 1984.  Hello?  Yeah, that was a while ago.  I mean, we were talking about VHS and beta.  My films are like black and white films now.  Yeah.  Although some people still find them quite, well, they still find them. 
[02:45:00]  Still find them.  It's...  And they, yeah.  But then you went over like completely legitimate movies.  Well, I think I was really annoyed after that because I really, I was so serious about  being taken seriously.  Yeah.  Because I said, so I was, like, you have a lot of that angst.  When I did my first record and I was working with John Waters and I had just left that industry  and I was all of 18 years old.  Right.  When I finished with it, I wanted to prove to everybody that,  I was more than.  So I didn't get to have a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Now I'm just kind of like, you know what? 
[02:45:30]  It's part of the whole package.  It is what it is.  It's been two decades.  And it's a small part of a much larger package.  Right, right.  Because you don't have any choice.  Yeah.  So instead of being defensive about it, now I've just kind of gone, yeah, I did that.  Wow.  Can you believe I did that?  Did John Waters approach you or was there, how did you two kind of hook up?  Because it's a great combination.  He's an amazing person.  He was, you know, Cry Baby was a great experience because, and I didn't know a lot about John.  When I first got the audition, I rented Pink Flamingos and I was horrified. 
[02:46:00]  I was like, oh my God.  What is he going to make me do in this audition?  Yeah.  You know, and so I auditioned for him and it was Johnny Depp's first leading role in  a film and there were a lot of first timers.  This was before Ricky Lake became a talk show host.  This was, I was crossing over.  We all had something to prove.  Mr. Pop, as I used to call him, Iggy Pop, was sober at the time.  I mean, we were a bunch of really juvenile delinquents living in a hotel in Baltimore for  three months.  Right.  It was the time of my life.  That does sound fun. 
[02:46:30]  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  We talked to John Waters once.  Wow.  He's scary.  I think he's hilarious.  Yeah.  He was really cool.  Oh no.  He was cool on our show.  He's just like, I don't know.  I just.  He's just, he's very.  He's twisted.  Yeah.  He's very weird.  He's twisted and way out there.  And that makes him so creative.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  He's fantastic.  He makes me laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really makes me laugh.  Anthony, you look like John Waters.  I've heard that when I had my little mustache, which I just shaved recently, but sometimes  I would whittle it down there and stuff and just act weird and try to be John Waters.  Hey.  I'd say, yeah, I'm going with the John Waters. 
[02:47:00]  Halloween's coming up.  You know, I, or I could go with the John Holmes.  We, we only have 37 minutes left and we have a, and we have a dating thing to do.  I know we, a dating thing.  Could you help us with the dating thing?  We got so screwed up into doing this dumb thing.  Yeah.  We don't want to do this.  So we're hoping you can help us out.  I'll help you, but I want to hear my song.  Yes.  I need to hear last track.  And you know, tonight at splash, I'm hosting pretty much the night of a thousand Tracy's.  So there should be like all the Tracy's of Tracy's or versions of Tracy's or maybe 
[02:47:30]  speaking of John Waters, Wanda Woodward inspired, whatever.  I'm hoping that could be, uh, the drag queens and the, and, and the hot chicks all come  out.  You are a favorite amongst the drag queens, aren't you?  Hey, a diva has got to have a good, loyal, gay following.  I am very grateful to them.  I wish I had a gay following.  Because I mean, who would do my hair?  I'd love a gay following.  Well, you need to lay off the pizza, honey.  I was just going to say, that's two guests making fun of your weight.  Oh, man.  Sorry. 
[02:48:00]  What a happy day this is.  That wasn't even making, she was actually being serious and concerned.  Of course.  That was out of concern.  No, man was joking.  She was like, seriously, fatso.  All right, look.  I didn't say fatso.  I just said a little less pizza.  That was the voice in my head.  We will, we will play the song like a victory song, a love song, like, like when Bobo comes  around and sees, here's the, here's the deal.  We got this guy, Bobo, with something's wrong with him.  We don't know what it is, but he's not quite right.  He doesn't have a girl, never has.  So these girls. 
[02:48:30]  Well, his name is Bobo.  I know.  I mean, that's a problem.  Yeah, that's probably part of the problem.  So these girls decided for the chance to win $1,000, they were going to come in and  see which girl Bobo picks.  It's a complete ripoff of the dating game.  We understand.  And it's kind of hacky, old fucking radio, but the guy's kind of a tard, so it makes  it a little different.  And usually gets naked and he gets hard on us really fast and stuff.  Well, I've, I've made a pledge not to use, I know.  Oh, you don't want to see this dick.  No, you probably don't want to.  I've made a pledge not to use the R word, so I changed it to the T word, which I just 
[02:49:00]  say tard.  Tard.  It works better that way.  I don't like bullying.  It looks like you're chewed up by a dog.  It's terrible.  It looks like a regular dick was melted.  Let's bring Bobo in.  Wait, does Tracy want to see a bad dick?  No, I don't think she does.  I've seen enough of my dick.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think she does.  I guarantee you haven't seen one like this.  That's Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, you want to show Tracy your, uh...  No, no, please.  What happened?  What is she doing?  She does not want to see it.  Okay, that's it.  She does not want to see it. 
[02:49:30]  She wants to see it.  Those are prescription sunglasses.  I will protect you.  What?  You will not see this.  Believe me.  If you see his penis...  I will throw myself, like a hand grenade, I'll throw myself on his dick.  What?  Do you swear to me?  Uh, well, maybe not that far, but...  Bobby, help me out here.  Tracy Lord's looking at Bobo's dick.  That's classic.  No.  I don't want to...  And then we play the song.  No.  I don't want to...  You know, I will sue you for injuries.  Exactly.  She's been through enough.  Yes.  She has been through enough.  She's been through enough.  She's been through enough.  She's got a new...  It's all starting to fade.  She's got a new single out.  Come on.  What the fuck are we doing here? 
[02:50:00]  Last drag.  I want to hear the song.  We're going to hear the song.  Bobo, pull your pants down.  Bobo, keep your goddamn pants on.  Bobo, if you ever want to be on the show again, you'll pull your pants down.  Bobo, you'll never be back on the show if you pull your pants down.  And the thing is that, I know you're going to try not to look, but you're going to look.  No, no, no, don't look.  Because you can't not look.  I'm not.  I'm going to stay in this direction.  It's like the Ark of the Covenant.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Your face will melt like that.  Sam, is he allowed to pull his pants down for Tracy Lawrence?  I say no.  I vote no.  Has the game started yet?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, no.  No, it hasn't.  Are you sure?  I say Tracy does not want to.  But I'm not one of the potential dates.  So it's not fair.  So the game hasn't started.  I feel...  No, I'm judging the drag contest tonight.  Not to.  Yes.  Penis.  You're going to see a drag.  We're about to show you.  I'm a good judge of character.  And I don't think Tracy wants to see this.  I think I can get a vibe that she doesn't want.  Let me handle this.  Please.  Tracy, listen.  That worked in the past.  Let's see.  The mayor's dead.  Listen to me.  Tracy.  Let's see what I...  I am going to show you something you've never seen before. 
[02:51:00]  That's all.  I don't like when a man says that to me.  It makes me nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's almost...  It's almost...  It's a threat.  It's almost interesting.  It's interesting.  It's not...  Bobo, pull your pants down for Tracy Lawrence.  Bobo, I can't...  I'm not looking.  I'm not going to be...  Bobo, I am not party to this.  Is he even alive today?  Bobo.  I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's in a coma.  I am.  What's going on?  You can't hear them in the head for him?  Yeah, I can hear you.  All right.  Pull your pants down for Tracy Lawrence.  I'm not so thrilled about this. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  I can't do this.  If you ever want to be on the show again, you'll do it.  She's putting her glasses on.  I'm not too thrilled about this.  I just can't do that.  Bobo.  Now, my makeup artist, Priscilla's out there.  Maybe she can help with this situation.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you getting scared?  Club Soda Kenny?  What happened now?  There's a problem with Tracy's people.  They don't want the curtains closed.  Of course they don't.  They want to keep an eye on what's going on with their girl.  But that's fine, because Bobo's not going to be over there.  He's over here.  So he's in a good spot. 
[02:52:00]  Bobo.  Really cool.  See?  I've got my little entourage out there.  They're very alarmed.  Are they alarmed?  Are they alarmed?  They're alarmed.  Oh, you looked up.  She looked over her shoulder at Bobo.  They're very protective of you.  Are you looking for help?  And well, they should be.  Are you looking for help?  Are you looking for help?  Tracy Lawrence has great legs.  Is it three of them or four?  You have four people or three?  Crazy.  Nice legs.  She looks really good.  Four.  Five.  Those stockings with the...  She looks good from head to toe.  Bobo, pull your pants down.  I'm really...  I think I'm a little smitten.  Pull your pants down.  See, I don't usually do the stocking thing, but I'm like, these are kind of... 
[02:52:30]  Those are very nice.  That looks fantastic.  I like thigh highs.  Bobo.  Those are very sexy.  Bobo.  How do I go from Tracy Lawrence's legs to Bobo?  I mean, it's just...  I've done everything I can to set an atmosphere of sensuality.  Sensuality.  And this person comes in and completely ruins it for me.  And do it in a way that's subtle yet sexy.  It's not filthy, but it's sensual.  And then this trash has to happen? 
[02:53:00]  I'm upset.  Tracy, personal apology from me to you right now.  Thank you.  I think I'm...  I think I've been outvoted here.  What happened?  What happened?  I would apologize, but it really...  My apology doesn't matter.  What happened?  He's very nervous.  Bobo, pull your pants down for Tracy Lawrence.  She's a big star.  I don't want her to be looked at as like an idiot in the street.  I understand.  She's a big star, though.  You're not in the street, Bobo.  You have really hot people in your...  Yeah, you've got hot people around you.  Oh, my God.  You've got ugly up your entourage.  Oh, yeah.  They are cute. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, really cute.  That's Miss Sylvia Tosin.  It looks like a reality show out there.  That's the fabulous singer Sylvia Tosin.  Oh.  And then next to her is Miss Priscilla.  And she's a wicked, wicked makeup artist.  Is that the guy on his BlackBerry?  No, it's not.  No.  Tracy.  Who's Priscilla?  Tracy.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Oh, she turned her head.  Oh, God.  You tricked her.  It's okay.  You fucking tricked her.  I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  You tricked her. 
[02:54:00]  You just said it over there.  It's like a small little weasel chasing something.  Oh, God.  A small little weasel chasing something.  You tricked her so bad.  Oh, my God.  That was dishonest.  Now we get to play her song.  Oh, all right.  See how this works?  What's the song?  Oh, that was horrible.  Yeah, what is the song, Tracy?  This is Last Drag.  You all right?  Oh, boy, was that a drag?  That's what I said.  People are saying that was the most realistic movie horror scream they've ever heard out  of you.  That was horror.  That was true.  That was not acting. 
[02:54:30]  No.  Bobo, she hates your penis.  You didn't see what I saw.  I'm sorry, Bobo, but really, I wasn't quite ready for all of that.  No.  I thought you were going to shave down for the ladies today.  What happened, Bobo?  I shaved down as much as I could.  It's a lot of hair.  But you know.  He should see a waxer, because my God.  A waxer.  Well, someone might wax off his thing there.  Yes, but it looks bigger when there's less of the hair, right?  He needs to go to a barbershop in Harlem for that thing. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, get a slow fade.  It's like an Oscar Mayer wiener poking out of a chia pet.  It was.  That was an awful, awful sight.  Why is Bobo just sitting there?  Bobo, you all right?  I can't make radio out of this shit.  Here we go, Bobo.  I'm going to help you out a little bit.  Are you talking?  This is your time.  Die.  This is your time to get a girl.  We have two beautiful girls that are going to be vying for your attention, and a date out  with you, and they're going to win like a grand.  You're just going to get a night out with them.  Aren't you excited about this?  Yeah, I am excited.  Let's hear it. 
[02:55:30]  So what's your problem?  I think I figured out what his problem is.  What's his problem?  He's so petrified that what he says will ban him from the show that he's become afraid to  do or say anything.  You're already bad because you're not listening to us, so enjoy your last appearance.  You want to see his asshole?  No.  Dude, no.  I swear I draw the line.  No, I fucking draw the line there, too.  No.  I don't draw the line at the end.  Oh, wow.  You're crazy.  Bobo, you're staring like a lunatic.  Yeah, what's up?  You're not talking. 
[02:56:00]  I'm excited about the contest.  Do you know who Tracy Lords is?  Do you know Tracy Lords?  I've heard the name.  I don't know much about her.  That's a problem.  It's probably best.  Yeah, it is.  Isn't she pretty?  I mean, she is.  I mean, she has aged well.  I can tell you.  Jesus Christ, Bobo.  No, I mean, she's still got it.  Little fucker.  Yeah, right?  No, I mean, she's still got it.  Jesus shit.  She's still got it.  You wouldn't know it if it slapped you in the face.  Well, he's never had it.  That's from Happy Days.  Oh, no, he's never had it. 
[02:56:30]  It's the problem.  He's never had it.  That is true.  Aged well.  That's not the case here.  Tracy's fucking stunning, you dope.  She's stunning, you dope.  You see those legs and they just fucking with the stockings?  It's fucking captivating.  I'm all fucked up over this.  Are you really?  When she said, you read the back of the stocking, I'm like, what the fuck?  Did it move?  Tracy's legs.  It moved a little, right?  They're amazing.  It moved a little.  Yes.  Can we play Tracy Lord's song?  Oh, please, God, play my song, the love of God.  Let's play the song.  Let's play the song.  Last Drag, maybe.  That's right.  I know that. 
[02:57:00]  Last Drag.  What I meant to say was, where can they get it?  This crap radio that's going on.  Well, it'll be coming out at the end of October, and of course, it'll be on iTunes, and they  can go to C2Sun Records to find out more, and they can always check my website, TracyLords.com,  or my Facebook, or my Twitter, TheTracyLords.  Do you have the song, Sam?  Well, I don't have a CD.  No, I don't have the song.  Who has the song?  Who has the song?  Oh, you've got to be joking.  Eric just looked at me and said, you have the song.  Oh, shit.  That would have been hilarious. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, by the way, can you just sing it?  Because we don't have it.  We don't have it.  How are you holding up, Bobo?  You ready to hear the song?  Track one?  This is Tracy's fucking song, man.  Get up for it.  I'm ready to hear it.  Not literally get up for it.  Oh, no, please don't get up again.  I mean, I am ready to hear it.  You want to see how easily he gets hard?  No.  I don't.  What?  What happened?  I feel much safer with him.  Well, can we at least explain it to Tracy Ward?  I am not fucking know.  I can't see it.  Leave Tracy alone with this shit.  All I'm saying is...  I'm on a diet and I don't eat that much and I don't want to lose what I do eat. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Can I at least explain what happens?  He doesn't have to do it.  He's so twisted.  Tracy, listen to me for a second.  And I made a mean pizza joke.  I'm sorry.  You look like a younger version of my aunt.  What?  What?  Yeah.  It's freaking me out.  Your compliments stink.  That's a younger version of my aunt.  Who cares?  I'm a good looking guy.  The word fucking aunt is not a compliment.  It should never be used.  Ant should never be used as a compliment.  Yeah.  At least you didn't say you look like a younger version of my daughter.  It's like...  That would be kind of dirty. 
[02:58:30]  That's like...  You look like...  What's wrong with that?  You look like a sexy version of an English teacher I used to have that would dress very conservatively.  Oh, that's good.  Now I can picture her dressed like that and it's really hot.  What about you, Bobby?  I am.  You are married.  Everything just got ruined.  Lucky dog.  How long have you been married, Tracy?  That's why I have the lingerie.  How long have you been married?  Keeping him happy.  For 10 years.  Really?  Nice.  Wow.  What does he do?  Beats up people, so be careful.  No.  Actually, he is an iron worker. 
[02:59:00]  He does iron.  Oh, really?  You married a blue collar.  I did.  A Colorado boy.  Wow.  A friggin' guy slinging eye beams around and stuff.  Well, you know, I went through my share of bad boys.  Right, yeah.  And they were a lot of fun.  Right.  We are.  But they were a pain in the ass.  At the end of the day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so finally, I tried to make a little experiment, so I decided to date a nice man.  She said bad boys.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Exactly.  Not homebodies.  Well, I occasionally like playing with bad boys.  Right, I'm a little agoraphobic.  Yeah, fucking Howard Hughes. 
[02:59:30]  And so is his mind over Tracy.  You're smitten here.  I'm very taken with her.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  She looks great, as Bobo so eloquently put it.  What a turd you are, Bobo.  All right, let's play Tracy's song.  Bobo's an idiot.  Because we're going to set up for the dating game, and I hope Tracy stays.  She's beautiful.  She's unbelievable.  Of course.  So this is the drag, right?  Last drag.  Last drag.  Last drag.  And the Tracy Lords on Twitter, that's where you'll get all your Tracy Lords info.  Yep, and you can come see me tonight at Splash.  But here's Last Drag by Tracy Lords. 
[03:00:00]  Last Drag by Tracy Lords.

You were my last drag, baby.  You're just like a cigarette.  I'm used to crave you, but I don't anymore.  I'm gonna pack on that cigarette.

You were my last drag, baby.  You were my last drag, baby.  You were my last drag.  The taste of your knife lingers.  The taste of your knife lingers.  It tastes bitter, yes it does

[03:03:00]  man. That was good. That was really good. I like that.  You know what I like about it? It's not  something. I know. Holy shit. What are you  doing?  Why don't we start tweeting some of this shit? 
[03:03:30]  Why hasn't someone taken... Oh, Bobby, you got a picture?  I need that immediately sent to me for  tonight's festivities.  I never get up on a goddamn  console. That's a great leg. I'm gonna be in trouble  with my wife, huh?  We're gonna tweet this shit, Tracy.  Ow! I fucking pulled a hammy.  Pulled a hammy.  Hold on a minute, Tracy.  This is for Twitter. I've got a couple followers,  so we're gonna do this right. Tracy Lourdes  with her legs up in the fucking head. I liked how  it did it. It sounded more rock-like  than techno, with the drums 
[03:04:00]  in there and shit. It's got the edge to it.  It's Britney Spears without the drugs, man.  It was very  catchy and  poppy and stuff. It wasn't like just  techno where it's gonna be in a club  and sound like the next song that comes on.  I liked it. If you heard that song  on the radio, you wouldn't. You'd be like,  who the fuck is this? Nah, I'd be bopping my head to it.  You know what I mean? You know what happened?  I got caught up in a song like that that stupid  fucking Tink Tings got me like that.  The Tink Tings. I was like, it's kind of fucking poppy.  Tracy, move the microphone. I'm tweeting these fucking pictures. 
[03:04:30]  It's got that feel to it.  I'm doing some last drag pics  right here. Goddamn. You like it that way?  We can't see your beautiful face, though.  Those are fucking classic Hollywood games.  Alright, here we go. Right here.  Look. Look.  What are you... Holy shit, this bitch is hot.  Classic Hollywood legs.  They're beautiful. They're unbelievable.  I'm glad the stockings are a hit.  They are.  But I'm even happier that you like my song.  It was. It was very poppy. I like it. Very catchy.  Yeah, very good.  How many songs on the album?  Well, we're just getting started.  That's the single right now.  So I'm gonna be recording lots of new music. 
[03:05:00]  You know, this is the single.  As I said, I'm gonna be doing the video  in about a week.  And I'm just really excited about this project.  Could be the best fucking pop song I've ever heard.  I think it's the best thing I've done.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  That's good.  I'm happy about that.  Fuck that lady Gaga.  I'm happy that the legs are in the shape of her.  Yeah, you got goddamn good legs.  Look at the calves and everything.  Can you tell I have a three-year-old?  Like the whole thing.  You have a three-year-old in there right now?  That's pretty amazing.  You got a three-year-old? 
[03:05:30]  Is that your first kid?  Yep, my only one.  A little boy.  Thank God I have a little boy.  Yeah, a little girl.  If I had a girl, I'd have to lock her somewhere up.  Man, you would be screaming, do as I say, not as I do, every day.  Yes.  I got a son.  I can't imagine having a daughter.  Fuck that.  Oh, my son is awesome.  He worships me.  Little boys love their mom.  I'm scared I'm going to have a girl someday.  I don't know how I handle that.  Bobo, you ready for this?  Well, you just keep your pants zipped and keep Bobo away from your wife. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, wow.  He's quite a cat.  Stupid Bobo.  Doing nothing for us today.  Why don't we move on and do this?  Tracy, believe me, you don't have to be partied to this crap that's going to happen in the corner.  Okay.  You don't want to stay?  Because I just know it's going to get freaking ugly in here.  What happened?  You know how it gets.  You want Tracy to leave so we can hang out with Bobo?  Are you feeling all right?  I know their people are like, you know.  They're like, she's leaving now.  I know.  Are you leaving now? 
[03:06:30]  You've done enough to her.  Yes.  I think Kent doesn't want you to leave.  No, I love Tracy.  Because this is weird.  He doesn't like Bobo.  No, do I get a kiss goodbye, boys?  Yes.  I want a picture, too.  What did Tracy do to you?  You don't want her out anymore.  I didn't say anything like that.  Why are you making trouble?  How about we ask her if she wants to stay?  You're like bad cop, bad cop.  Do you want to stay, Tracy?  I can stay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, see, Sylvia says I can stay.  I can stay.  Someone's getting fired after the show.  I was trying to leave, you dummy.  Why would you do that?  I thought you wanted to stay. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  That's Miss Sylvia.  That's so true, Bobby.  How cute is she?  She's all right, man.  She's nothing like you, though, Tracy.  Nothing.  It's the stalking.  The fucking best pop song I've ever goddamn heard right there.  Last drag.  All right.  The Tracy Lawrence on Twitter.  That's what I'm talking about, Bobby.  All right.  That's what I'm talking about.  I like it.  Fuck that Lady Gaga shit.  All right.  Look.  What happened?  Well, we only have 15 minutes now to do this amazing festivities.  Let's fucking do it.  Let's flow through it.  Let me tell you. 
[03:07:30]  This contest is being sponsored by the wonderful people at Trojan Condoms.  Get closer with triple-tested quality Trojan bearskin condoms.  And it's B-A-R-E skin, not like a heavy, woolly, that would be, that would vary a little  sensitivity in actual bearskin condoms.  With the claws?  Yes.  Clawed for her pleasure.  No, it's a quality Trojan bearskin condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  And Bobo, you are the guest of honor here.  Yeah, we got production, though.  Guys worked hard on this.  Production?  What is that?  No, I hear it's good.  I love Tracy's Dutch sailor that she...  Oh, isn't he?  Isn't he cute?  Dutch sailor.  That's Andrew.  And Bobby's attracted to Andrew.  Andrew's very...  No!  That's basically what's going on there.  Because he's fashionable.  Because I didn't even notice you were in the room.  He's a very fashionable dude.  He out-hairs fucking Troy Clark.  Troy, that's what I'm saying.  Bobby's hair.  A little attraction.  You can be honest.  You're among friends. 
[03:08:30]  He has good hair.  You're among friends.  A little attraction.  He has good hair.  Andrew, a little bit.  I don't like blondes.  Oh, please.  Andrew collects boys like I collect shoes.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  And other tees.  Another tees.  Oh, yes, boys.  Like tonight down at Splash, I'm sure he'll have a ball.  Oh, yeah.  All right, here's the big open.  What do you think of this guy?  Exactly.  Or three.  Our boy over here, our own Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Is this your full-time job?  He's a what?  Is this your full-time job?  Oh, it's a full-time job.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought he said circle to thumb. 
[03:09:00]  Physically, you like the way he looks or anything?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly, right?  He's like, he's kind of twinkish.  See this?  Now, this is no longer about Bobo's dating.  It's about Andrew's.  Exactly.  Things are turning.  We've always thought Sam was a cute kind of twinkish thing.  I didn't like when he first.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I know, but when he first came on the job, he didn't have that pesky facial hair that he's  got now.  He looked a lot sweeter and rosy cheek.  See, now, this is a big compliment because Andrew's currently been very, very smitten with 
[03:09:30]  Pete Wentz.  Now I'm just feeling creepy for actually having found him attractive when he was younger.  And his eyebrows are bushy now.  I feel like a priest must feel after their abused kids grow up.  Like, well, I'm just saying, he's got facial hair.  Comes in father for everything.  You got a deep voice.  Oh, God.  He was so attractive at one point.  He's slinking off.  You've made him leave.  I know, I know.  See what happens?  I'm done.  His camera lens just got a lot bigger, though.  I get it.  Hey, let's do the Bobo intro to the stupid dating game so we can start our stupid weekends. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  I fucking think that was the best pop song ever, man.  I liked it.  The best fucking pop song.  Oh, good.  Would you play it again?  Yes.  Yes, we will.  Thank you very much.  Is that available for download?  Yes.  Off iTunes.  It shall be, yes.  In October.  In October, you'll be able to get it off iTunes.  That's getting right on my phone.  I'm going to start passing that out illegally.  Oh, very cool.  What?  Yeah.  What?  What is she doing?  She's pointing, writing.  Can we play the intro?  All right, here's the intro. 
[03:10:30]  Is she dead?  You want autographs.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents The Bobo Dating Game.  The only game where three eligible bachelorettes compete for the chance to be the masturbation  fodder of a studly single guy with a mangled, horribly scarred tiny con and $1,000 cash.  And now your hosts of The Bobo Dating Game, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:11:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for some something today.  Boy, this special guest we have today is Bobo.  He's the man of honor.  The man that will be choosing between two girls because one backed out.  Now, where did you find these women is what I want to know.  They are $1,000.  They were being offered $1,000 to go out on a lunch date.  Not even dinner.  They want daylight.  And with our own chaperone, Sam Roberts.  It's more of a responsibility than part of the prize. 
[03:11:30]  We'll be going along to make sure no shenanigans happen because we don't know what his deal is, truthfully.  Now, Bobo, are you excited for this?  Come on.  Yeah, I'm excited about this.  And the ladies need to know my name is Daniel.  Bobo!  Daniel Bobo Curlin.  Bobo!  Is his name?  They can call me Daniel.  Let me tell you a little bit about Daniel.  Daniel lives in Queens.  He has a dog named Mr. Maloonigans.  And he loves the Mets.  Yep, that's right.  What is he looking for in a woman is what I want to know. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, very good, Tracy Lord.  Very good.  Tracy Lord's on guest host here.  Well, I had to ask.  What are you looking for in a woman besides that horrible little penis?  And youth, obviously, is an issue with him.  Yes, of course it is.  Because we all remember back in the Stone Age when Tracy held up so well.  You creepy.  I'm looking for a girl that's a nice person and has a good sense of humor.  Yeah, she needs one of those.  And loves animals.  Definitely.  Yeah, well, that's good.  More importantly, Tracy. 
[03:12:30]  Hold on.  I'm asking Tracy something.  Yeah.  Do you want me to tweet the extremely sexy Tracy Lords or the extremely still sexy Tracy Lords?  Oh, please.  Which one do you want?  The extremely sexy.  How about the always sexy?  The always.  Ooh, snap.  Always.  All right, go back to Bobo.  Sorry.  The always.  Okay, Bobo, and a girl with a sense of humor.  And also, during baseball and football season, they've got to be rooting for a team with 
[03:13:00]  the initials NY somewhere in their uniform.  And how about one dead eye?  Yeah.  And let me tell you, one of my friends, my friend, Hank Liverpool, and something to the  prize.  An extra ticket to the Giants versus the Jets.  All right, let's introduce the lovely ladies.  They're going to be vying for the attention of Bobo.  I've got one more question for Tracy.  Oh, Jesus.  The always sexy, the Tracy Lord, so they follow you on Twitter. 
[03:13:30]  Yes.  Showing off her, and I need an adjective for those legs.  How about gams?  Gams.  I like that.  Just showing off her gams.  Gams.  Not like her delicious gams or her...  You need an adjective.  How about her luscious gams?  Luscious.  Her luscious.  I don't know how to spell luscious.  How about her switchblades?  What's the matter?  You don't got an iPhone?  I can spell anything with an iPhone.  You like that?  I kind of like that.  It's kind of dangerous.  Like switchblades, you think they're...  Yeah.  There you go.  Fuck.  Nothing about the snatch.  You're right, man.  Yeah, I think I'm okay. 
[03:14:00]  Nothing about the snatch.  Oh, sorry.  Dirty bird.  You said that out loud.  I have filth ribs with her.  Really?  Yeah, we're fucking out of our minds about her.  She got those, like, that whole body thing that's fucking nice.  Yeah.  It works.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's hot.  She's not fat and ugly, you mean?  No.  Oh, man.  No.  Not short and stubby like Bobo's dick.  Get it?  Bobo?  Yeah.  Sense of humor, right?  Where are we at, Ed?  Where are we at?  It's on ladies.  Fucking Ed.  Do we have to do the production for each lady?  Oh, shit.  There's only two of them. 
[03:14:30]  He makes a good point, Opie.  There are only two.  You got five minutes to figure this shit out, because I'm starting my weekend.  Of course.  I'm not spending an extra minute with Bobo.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's bring the ladies in.  The first girl.  Well, let's do the first girl.  What?  What happened?  Let's bring the lady in.  Play the production for the first one.  Oh, just drop down to one now?  Can you tell we don't do any of this hacky-produced radio ever?  You know what?  Because we always just talk.  That fucking pop song, man.  I'm telling you right the fuck now.  I know.  I like it.  I'm telling you right the fuck now.  I don't know why you're waiting to put that shit out. 
[03:15:00]  It's catchy.  Let's just go ahead and forget about Bobo and play my song again.  I'm actually going to have him burn me a copy.  No, I won't.  I swear.  Let's push that Lady Gaga right off the fucking charts.  What do you say, Sam?  I like that idea.  Lady who is what we're saying today, Tracy Woods.  Why are we frigging time is ticking?  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the first lady.  What's her name, Sam?  Now, let's meet the ladies slash victims.  Courtney's a 22-year-old vixen born and raised in glamorous Connecticut.  She's half Polish, half Filipino, and would love to have all of Bobo. 
[03:15:30]  Courtney has a bachelor's degree in communications, and is currently looking for a job in the television  industry.  Bobo still lives at home, and didn't graduate high school until he was deep into his 20s.  Courtney has been lied to, cheated on, and treated like shit by men, and hopes Bobo is  the nice moronic guy she's looking for.  That's great.  That's awesome.  That is a fantastic introduction.  I hope she nodded her head.  Wow.  She's like, yep, I've been shit on.  That's me.  Oh, there she is, Tracy.  Yeah.  She's cute. 
[03:16:00]  She's all right.  She's very cute.  Thank you.  Adorable.  And that's coming from Tracy Lourdes.  Yeah, Tracy Lourdes.  Do you know Tracy Lourdes?  I've heard, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And Zach and Marie?  Zach and Mary.  Yes.  Zach and Mary make a porno.  Kevin Smith's movie.  Exactly, yes.  We're friends with Kevin Smith.  You know that, right?  I love Kevin Smith.  Kevin's a good egg, yes.  Yeah.  We like Kevin a lot.  He's a twisted little monkey.  Oh, he really is.  Well, he started smoking pot on the set of that particular movie, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, he smoked pot before then.  Yeah, I kind of think he did, too.  He told us he really didn't.  Really?  Now he's regularly smoking the pot because of Seth. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, Seth really started making him smoke weed.  I think he does that to everybody, though.  That's what I hear.  Story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Girl number two?  Oh, right.  Shit.  Time is ticking.  Four minutes left in the contest.  Yeah.  Very good.  Let's go.  Bobo, what are you doing?  Are you trying to be-  Jackie is a 26-year-old resident of Manhattan  and proudly proclaims that she is white and beautiful.  She is a successful small business franchise owner  and wants to show Bobo what a real woman is like.  She looks forward to boosting Daniel's self-esteem and pathetic public image. 
[03:17:00]  Although, she's never heard the show before  and is unaware of the horrible mistake she's made coming here.  That's true.  What?  Her uncle is a fan of this program.  She's never heard the show.  What a fucking asshole he is.  And picked her out to do this contest for a thousand bucks.  Your uncle is an asshole.  I don't think he would eat through a night with her.  I'm going to give you a thousand dollars to leave right now.  Now, do you know Tracy?  She's back in the office stealing everything.  Oh, I bet.  All the swag.  This is Tracy Lourdes, of course. 
[03:17:30]  Yes, Bubbles.  I love Bubbles.  Oh, yay, Bubbles.  See?  Zach and Mary Bubbles.  Goddamn, man.  Fantastic.  You know, sometimes people ask me to do that trick at parties.  It's very embarrassing.  I bet.  Yeah.  So, both of you lovely young ladies are here trying to get the date.  The date of the century.  And the thousand dollars, which I'm sure you're not even interested in.  It's all about Bobo at this point.  Now, you...  What the hell?  Courtney.  Courtney.  Hi.  Hi, Courtney.  You know the show.  Yes.  So, you've listened and you know about Bobo and you know what he sounds like and what 
[03:18:00]  his story is and everything?  Yeah, I pretty much know the basic background.  Now, you, not so much.  No.  Do you know anything about Bobo?  I used to listen to you guys when I was a bit younger.  I remember some kind of 55-gallon trash conversation.  Oh, the drum challenge, yes.  Oh, wait, can I...  How old were you when you listened to that boy?  Um, 15?  Oh.  Can we just stop?  Is that him breathing into the fucking microphone?  Yes.  Yes.  He's very excited, Bobby.  Well, can we get his fat head away from the mic while we talk to the girls? 
[03:18:30]  Bobo, why are you looking to the side?  Hey.  Hey, Bobo.  Hey.  No, try not to look.  No, you look...  Don't look.  Don't look.  That's the game.  He's peeking.  He's totally trying to peek.  I'm trying not to.  No, you weren't.  Your head's turned.  How do you not know what your head is doing?  Keep your head straight.  You should put some sort of a cloak over his head.  Yeah, we should put some kind of a cloak over his head and a noose around his neck and  then drop the floor out.  He has the brains of a goldfish.  Can I ask you a question, Ed?  Yes, certainly.  The two contestants? 
[03:19:00]  Yes.  Either one of you really want anything to do with Bobo, right?  You're just doing it for the money?  Well, it would be cool to have lunch with him.  That sounded very positive.  I just love to pull up the contest before it begins.  Yes, Tracy.  Oh, Tracy, yes.  How do you feel about small rodents like Chia Pets say?  I love ferrets.  Oh, you like ferrets?  What about moles?  Like little mole creatures and things like that?  They're cute.  Do you find hair on a man attractive or unattractive? 
[03:19:30]  I find it attractive.  Yeah.  Yeah, it can be.  In certain places?  Yeah.  The bushier the better.  Wow.  They like bush.  Wow.  They are Bobo fans.  Who are you?  Where are you coming from?  Where did you get these girls?  All right.  Look, we got to get to the meat of this whole thing.  We got two minutes left.  And then we get back to that fucking pop song.  I'm telling you, man.  Now we got questions that Bobo is going to ask of the young ladies.  Where are the questions?  Oh, look. 
[03:20:00]  Here comes the hood.  Now it's victim number one and victim number two.  You have to ask these questions, too.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Are you medicated?  No, I'm just trying to get ready.  When do I start reading the questions?  Right now.  Right now.  Hold on, but answer right.  What's going on with you today, Bobo?  Bobo, what's the matter?  Are you medicated or something?  No, I'm just nervous.  I'm trying to make sure that this turns out okay.  Well, that's already failed.  You had four Whoppers, I'm hearing? 
[03:20:30]  Did you eat four Whoppers, you fat fuck?  No.  I did.  I was hungry.  I was hungry.  I love self-deprecating humor.  That's an overstatement.  Okay.  Well, anyway, why don't we start?  Bobo, start asking questions.  Are these two lovely young ladies?  All right.  And not in just a monotone reading voice.  Have a little fucking class of a romance to it.  We'll have Courtney be victim number one.  All right.  Courtney is victim number one.  Okay.  That's good.  Victim number one. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  This makes me want to drink.  It really does.  Victim number one.  My penis is only three and a half inches with fully erect.  Lie.  What's your favorite color?  Well, first of all, I'd like to say three is my favorite and lucky number.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Hubba, hubba.  And I'd have to go with blue.  Blue.  Oh.  That's the color of it.  Yeah.  That's the color.  That's the ball.  That's the ball.  That's a nice color. 
[03:21:30]  Nice.  One of the colors of my favorite baseball team.  Oh, that's right.  Blue and orange for the Mets.  And there's a little black going on now, too.  I didn't graduate high school until I was in my early.  Who is this for?  And shouldn't the second girl answer that question?  Yes.  All right.  Well, we need the second.  What about the victim number two?  What's your answer?  What?  To the first question.  Ask them the same question.  My favorite colors are orange and blue.  But every once in a while, we should ask them both.  Every so often, they go, bachelorette number two. 
[03:22:00]  What do you think?  Yeah.  All right.  But just ask a goddamn question there, Bubba.  Okay, victim number two, and then the second question.  Yeah.  All right.  Victim number two.  I didn't graduate high school until I was in my early 20s.  What's your favorite subject at school and why?  What was, I mean?  I love science.  Both my parents, my mom, and my stepdad are doctors.  Oh.  I love medicine.  That's good.  And what a coincidence.  It was a lot for her to cure her.  Yeah.  They're both gynos.  Ah.  Well, he could almost go to a gyno. 
[03:22:30]  Another inch shorter.  The third question is for both of them.  Oh, for both of them.  Okay, the third question.  That's a good question.  Bubba, are you getting a feel for the girls by the answers?  Are you paying attention?  Yeah, I am.  I feel like you're reading, but you're not comprehending.  Who do you like better so far?  I don't know.  I think the victim number one starts to seem like a trooper.  Like, she seems to be like a true fan.  Boy.  All right.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  So victim number two needs to suck up more.  Is that what you're saying?  That seems to be the plan here. 
[03:23:00]  Go ahead, Bubba.  I'll read that next question.  All right.  I relate to Forrest Gump more than any other movie character.  To who?  Forrest Gump.  Oh, wow.  What movie character did you relate to and why?  Oh, man.  That's a tough one.  I mean, my life is like a box of chocolates, though.  Oh, that's good.  I would have to go probably with some child cartoon Disney movie.  Probably maybe Princess Jasmine.  Oh, Princess Jasmine. 
[03:23:30]  Look how sweet that is, right?  I relate to Bubbles in Zack and Mary make a porno.  Oh, yeah.  Tracy Lord.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  Wouldn't you get these fucking perfect girls?  I know.  She's going to win a date with Tracy Lord.  Tracy, that blue collar husband of yours is going to have a nice surprise later today.  Wouldn't he be?  Oh, he wouldn't be.  I'm just going to add her to my entourage for the day.  No, what's in the box? 
[03:24:00]  What's in the box?  Bubba?  Yeah.  I've admitted on the...  Wait, wait, for who?  For victim number two.  Oh, shit.  I've admitted to saying that I'm at least 50% gay.  15.  Why did you make yourself gay all of a sudden?  He's being honest.  He's correcting.  I don't mean it in, like, preference, but if people...  If you've seen what's on my iPod and some of the stuff...  What's the matter?  Tracy's got to go?  Oh.  Why does she got to go? 
[03:24:30]  I have to go.  We can't play your song a second time now.  We can later on the after show.  I'll play it on the after show.  Play it on the after show.  Greatest pop song, I'm telling you.  It's the greatest song ever.  You heard it here first.  I like it a lot.  So good to see you.  Tracy, thank you so much.  Thanks, Tracy.  That was great.  For coming in.  Tracy.  Thanks for being a good story to all that.  Bye, sweetie.  Who's got the camera?  I need a picture with Tracy.  Me too.  Can I get one?  Tracy.  I might have bad breath, but I'll go for a kiss, too.  Let me get a picture. 
[03:25:00]  Trey, can I get one, too?  Thank you so much, Tracy.  Best of luck with the record.  She's so cutie.  I like Tracy.  Oh, we got it in the background, all right?  Yeah.  Come on in.  Oh, I got a kiss.  I know, right?  Nice to see you guys.  Yeah.  Ooh.  That smells good, too. 
[03:25:30]  I know.  I had a shower today.  Damn it.  Take it easy.  Oh, Tracy.  Ooh.  I like this.  I'm going to do an up skirt.  Thanks so much, Tracy.  Take it easy, Tracy.  Thanks.  And good luck, ladies.  Thank you. 
[03:26:00]  That was great.  Yeah, good luck, ladies.  They've already lost any luck they would have.  Games.  Games.  That fucking song.  I'm telling you right the fuck now, man.  Nice.  All right, Bobo, come on.  Now I'm on overtime.  All right, question number one.  What?  For both of them.  For both of them.  For both of them.  Jesus, I'm angry.  I've usually masturbated into a used coffee cup or in a toilet.  If we were together, would you let me come? 
[03:26:30]  All right, that's a pretty blunt question.  Answer that one, honest blondie.  Yeah.  And you don't have Tracy Lords around at Deflect.  That was only two questions away from what's your favorite subject in school, right to can  I come?  What kind of question is that?  Would I let you?  Maybe all the tension and the blood pressure would make you grow a little bit more.  You should definitely just do it.  It's a given, right?  I mean, don't you have?  Oh, I see that.  Don't you have every right to just come?  Yeah, I have every right to.  I guess what's going on here is in some weird fantasy world, like where would the comment land on you, ladies? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, God.  The question was where.  Yeah, she's where.  Where.  Oh, where.  But I will say, I think one of these bachelorettes is working hard for that thousand dollars.  Yeah.  And boy, is Bobo going to be disappointed when he realizes it's all for the money.  I really just want to draw up my company's name, if that's possible.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that?  She just wants to play.  No, it's a perfume and body products company.  It's called Lakshmi NYC.  It's thegoddessline.org. 
[03:27:30]  And I'm also a partner for Del Toro Shoe Company.  Does it say Lakshmi?  Lakshmi.  It's an Indian goddess.  Is it Jewish?  No, it's an Indian goddess.  And it's essential oils and body products.  I had some Lakshmi the other last night.  What the hell?  You have Lakshmi?  Good food.  Plenty of it.  This Sunday, we're having Lakshmi over at my Uncle Betsy's house.  I love Lakshmi.  Lakshmi.  I'm in the Horace.  Mazel tov, Anthony, with your Lakshmi.  Mazel tov.  You have a little Lakshmi on your face.  Let me get that.  Yeah, get a little.  You have a schmutz of Lakshmi on you. 
[03:28:00]  Uh, hey.  What?  All right, so should we just call up?  That's the end of the questions?  It's up to you, guys.  Let me look over the questions and see if there's one anymore going.  We need to find out where the cum's going.  Yeah, where is the cum going?  Where's the cum going?  Where's the cum going?  You've said he's allowed to cum.  Where would the cum be on you?  Yeah.  Is what Bobo wants to know.  Wherever you'd like.  Oh, God.  You've got to be a little more detailed.  Be a little more detailed.  A little more detailed?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, can I ask Bobo a question?  Oh, go ahead.  Sure.  So, Bobo, what's your favorite body part? 
[03:28:30]  I like, uh, tits.  Yeah.  That's a classy motherfucker.  Ah, that is a classy motherfucker.  That's nice.  He is all about class and the women, man.  That is very...  You know class.  I like that she switched it up a little bit.  I like her.  I like it.  Yeah, yeah.  She's going to win the thousand bucks.  Yeah, she's working.  Oh, no, come on.  Don't, you know.  The other one's got schmutz.  The other one's got schmutz.  Schmutz, the fucking...  She's got a career.  Yeah, she's got a career.  Bobo doesn't even want to be here.  The other girl's been shit on by man and...  I think even Bobo can figure that shit out.  Bobo's got to remember which is which. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, true.  Yeah, he doesn't just get to pick.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, that's true.  If you pick contestant number two, I will take you over to Citi Field right now.  We can go get a Shake Shack burger and a beer, and it'll be the best day ever.  Oh, shit.  He doesn't put his thumb up.  All on me, because I have money.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Number two, go.  My girl is smart.  She doesn't know the Mets aren't home this weekend.  No, Bobo, this is victim number one.  We'll go with that.  And, yes, I'm unemployed, but number two over here... 
[03:29:30]  I mean, she has more time to fuck, Bobo.  More time to come on her tits.  I work from home.  Oh, no, no, no.  I work from home without a job.  Number two over here doesn't want to be here.  She said, when we're waiting, the only reason, the only reason why she's here is to plug her company.  You threw her on the bus.  Shit.  I like that shit.  Cat fight.  Cat fight.  Grab her hair.  Cat fight.  My uncle is the happiest man right now in that office. 
[03:30:00]  And you're not.  Leave me.  Oh, that's fine.  What would you do if you were to take Bobo right now on a date?  What would you take him?  What would it be?  She's going to the Shake Shack and a beer.  at City Field. That's like Mecca for him.  Well, I would say we'd walk around the city.  I mean, I'm not too familiar  since I don't live in the city like  someone over here. Are you listening, Bobo?  Yeah, I'm listening. You've got to remember this.  Danny's just laughing his ass  off at Bobo. 
[03:30:30]  Well, I'd be glad to share the city.  Alright.  Jesus. Maybe you could  take an ugly horse  carriage ride. If Bobo wanted to kiss  you, would you let him kiss you?  Never.  At the end of the date, like a nice little lip kiss.  Thank you. On the lips,  maybe not, but I mean, it depends  how the date went. You know, you never  really know. You don't know.  He knows.  It'll end with a roofie and a rape. 
[03:31:00]  But, you know,  that's all speculation. Alright, where are we  now there, Sam?  You want another question from Bobo?  I think Bobo should ask one more question  of both of the girls. Do you guys have a favorite?  There's a lot of good questions here,  so I don't mind continuing.  Okay.  Hey, I kind of like the last question.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ask this one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Both of them.  Both the last questions.  Oh, God, you are an idiot. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, I like  the sex with the brother question.  That's a good one.  I like the last question.  I like  the next question.  Did you write them?  They're all quiet.  We don't do shit for this show.  Okay, those three.  Alright, let's do the last question.  No, these three were good.  No, I mean  the last one on the page.  Oh, first?  Yeah.  Okay.  Good.  Go ahead, Bobo.  Read this right here. 
[03:32:00]  I've been known to be  confirmed bisexual.  Have you ever  hooked up with a person  of the same sex?  Whoa!  Now we're getting sexy.  Now we're getting sexy.  Bobo, is this because  you have half a vagina?  Oh.  This is why you're a half guy.  That's mean.  Oh.  That is mean.  Company owner.  I think she's just trying  to throw it at this point.  Oh, she got her plug-in  for her company.  That's all she cared about. 
[03:32:30]  Told you.  That's mean,  hotter of the two.  Oh, no.  I'm not even good  to deny that one.  That's not true.  No, no.  Because Bobo likes,  Bobo's a tit man, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  I'm not going to say  anything that might sway  Bobo's, you know,  anything there.  Bobo, one has bigger  boobies than the other.  So let me just say something.  He asked the question,  have you ever been  with a girl?  Either one of you.  Have you?  College days, maybe? 
[03:33:00]  No?  You've been shit on by men.  So did you maybe  try out a woman  at one point?  Well, college was  experimental for everything.  Oh, was it?  Yes.  Why don't you tell us  a little bit about that?  Uh, no.  Oh, shit.  Did it happen  in the dorm room?  Maybe.  Yeah?  Was it after  a night of drinking?  Maybe.  Yeah, that means yes.  Were you just  practicing kissing  a little?  Yeah, just practicing.  And then for some reason  you ended up  just in your panties.  Did you guys just finish 
[03:33:30]  a whole box of  Elio's pizza?  Oh, fucking  Bobby and his pizza.  That's college.  That's college.  So, I put ramen noodles  all over her pussy.  That's college.  That's college.  So, Bobo,  one more question?  Yes.  Yeah, we got one more  question for the girls.  Yeah.  We got a yes and a no  out of the sex question.  I know who I want to win.  I am a virgin  but have always wanted  to go muff diving. 
[03:34:00]  What sounds would you make  if I were deep sea diving  on you?  Oh, now we get into  a little play acting.  This is good.  We'll start out  with victim number two.  It'd be the sound  of a gunshot.  A self-inflicted gunshot.  She'd shoot herself  before she'd let Bobo  go down on her.  Yeah, but what about  your business?  It's lochs and bagels.  Whatever it was called.  Whatever it was.  What was it called?  What was it called?  Potato loch? 
[03:34:30]  Loch smear.  Loch smear.  Yeah.  Pap smear, what?  Pap smear.  No, it was...  Pap smear.  So, a gunshot.  We got a self-inflicted  gunshot wound to the head  from Bachelorette  victim number two.  Now, victim number one,  what would you sound like  if Bobo went,  as he says,  muff diving,  another deep sea  muff diving on you?  What kind of sounds  would you make?  I don't know.  This sounds like  it would just hurt.  No?  Well, no.  Well, just...  You know what?  Bobo wants to hear  a little bit. 
[03:35:00]  Shut your eyes a little  and just a little  play-acting into  the microphone, perhaps.  Do it.  Thousand bucks, honey.  Just a little.  Just for the thousand  right here.  Thousand bucks, sweetie.  Bobo, if I do this,  will you pick me?  Well, we can't guarantee  that at this point.  Do I have a chance?  Increase the chances.  Yeah, it's going to be  better than...  It's going to increase  the chances.  It's going to be better  than killing yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  You just got to...  Put it this way.  All you got to beat  is a gunshot wound.  So... 
[03:35:30]  So give a little...  There we go.  Come on, go ahead.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  It'll be easier.  Don't look at her.  She wants you not to get it.  Look at me.  Yeah, she's trying to get the thousand.  Do you think that helps?  No, I just want to see you  moan into a mic.  Go ahead.  No, I'm not going to moan  into a mic.  But just a little.  Maybe a little.  Maybe a little.  It might just be a little...  Oh, okay.  See, that beat a gunshot wound.  That's all she had to do.  That was pretty good.  You like that?  Now, do you want one more question  or do you want the conclusion 
[03:36:00]  of the game,  which is Bobo now  has to say what he remembers  about one and two.  Whichever he remembers  the most about accurately  is the winner of the contest.  Oh, so he doesn't even  really get to pick.  No, he doesn't.  No, whoever is the most memorable.  Whoever is the most memorable.  Wow, I love that twist  because somebody wasn't  paying attention to a lot of games.  He was looking down  the whole time.  This is a great twist  on a game  where normally  he would just pick  and now he's got it.  And it's in the rules.  The winner does have to go out  with Bobo. 
[03:36:30]  Today.  Today.  So I've got the answers here.  Okay.  Should I just ask Bobo  what he remembers?  Yeah.  Did you see their faces  when you said that?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  We just don't hand over  the $1,000.  Bobo, do you remember  what victim number one's  favorite color was?  Her favorite color was blue.  Oh.  His favorite color was blue.  Bobo, what was victim number two's  favorite class in school? 
[03:37:00]  Her favorite class in school  was science.  Oh, very good.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  He does have a Rain Man thing.  What was victim number one's  movie character  that she most identified with?  She identified with  Princess Jasmine  from the movie Aladdin.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  And victim number two?  I don't think she really gave a...  She did.  She did, though.  She gave, I think it was  Bubbles from  Back and Mary Big.  Holy shit. 
[03:37:30]  See, he's like  an idiot savant.  Where would victim number one  take you on a date?  Well, victim number one  doesn't know much  about the city,  but she would like  to do something like  walking around the park  and maybe wouldn't mind me,  you know,  sharing what I love  about New York City.  All right.  That's true.  You guys belong together.  And where would victim number two  take a plug out  she just threw in the towel?  Well, victim number two  was trying to use me 
[03:38:00]  like the whole she is.  Oh, shit!  Fuck, no!  Fuck, no!  You can't get up.  You have to stay there.  No, Moe, you say it like it is, kid.  You're probably saying stuff  based on what  her uncle told her  that the city field...  Very good, you remember.  Wow.  And probably doesn't even realize  that the Mets  aren't even home  this weekend. 
[03:38:30]  Duh!  Duh!  All right.  Every girl knows that,  right, Bobo?  If you're a Met fan,  you know.  That's right.  Wow.  Oh, shit, Sherlock.  He is fucking  passionate about this.  You got anything else  you want to say  to victim number two  while you're at it?  I wouldn't hold back  if I was you.  No way.  What do you want to say there, Bobo?  No, victim number two  was just bribed  and probably  had a gun point  to her head  by her uncle.  That's right.  She's what we call  a user  and probably 
[03:39:00]  if I had...  If I was rich,  I'd call her  a gold digger.  Whoa!  I have my own job.  Gold digger.  Yeah, she does.  And the Mets and Queens  both suck.  Oh!  That's a disgrace to you.  As a borough of Queens,  you are never welcomed  in a borough of Queens.  Stay out of Queens.  I would never go  to that filthy, smelly...  Whoa!  Bobo!  Her cunt probably smells.  Whoa!  Your core dirty. 
[03:39:30]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, no!  The gloves are off!  Bobo!  I did not see this contest  taking this horrid direction.  Oh, Bobo!  Real New Yorkers  live in the outer borough.  Real New Yorkers  love the Yankees.  Yes!  Yankees are nothing  but bandwagon fans.  Oh, look at them  holding on to the seat.  Mac fans are real fans.  Oh, yeah.  Most of those Yankee fans  are bandwagoners.  Really?  I don't like bandwagoners.  Bandwagoners from fucking 
[03:40:00]  the 19 fucking 20s?  No one liked Babe Ruth.  Yeah.  Yeah, what a bunch  of bandwagon jumpers.  Oh, that DiMaggio.  Yeah.  What a fad.  Now, I respect the ones  who were fans  during the losing years  who didn't just jump  on the bandwagon  in 1996.  So you're respecting  all the Mets fans?  Right now?  During the losing years?  Is that all you want to say  to victim number two?  I don't know, man.  You have to be a fan  of a loser.  Oh! 
[03:40:30]  Bobo, a fan of a loser  is what she's saying.  Loser.  What do you think  of that, Bobo?  I gotta put her head  in a hat box.  What?  I don't respect whores.  Holy shit.  Jesus, Bobo?  Relax.  Bobo, wow.  Bobo has taken this  to a whole nother level. 
[03:41:00]  Wow, Bobo.  At least my uncle  didn't sell me  like a cheap  dime shoe hooker.  Bobo!  Bobo, where does this  come from?  It's unbelievable.  It's like you have  writers or something.  Dying shit!  It is kind of  how he feels.  I can see why  you're still a virgin.  Yes!  Oh, she can see  why you're still  a virgin, Bobo.  That means  because you've got  no fucking game  with girls.  You're nasty to them.  At least he's honest.  Oh!  No, I'm nice  to the ones  that are nice to me. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Really?  I'm not nice  to the mean ones.  He started with me.  That's what I saw.  Although you did  diss his Mets.  You did diss his Mets.  And I'm not nice  to users.  And you dissed  the borough of Queens.  Wow.  And he said  I sound like  a user in a ghost.  I know.  I hear you.  Because you said  you were plugging.  What do you think  when you have to go  through Queens?  You're not a virgin.  I avoid that area  at all costs.  Fuck another uncle,  bitch.  Jesus. 
[03:42:00]  Bobo, why would you  say that?  Why would you?  Bobo, I heard  you fuck animals  and men.  You gotta be  nasty.  That ain't true.  You fuck animals  and men.  I wouldn't put  that shitty cock  in that  disease  pussy.  I can't take  this.  Rubo!  That bitch  lets herself  get raped by  those rooms  in the L-Lone 
[03:42:30]  Cookie Monster  suits.  What?  What the fuck  was that?  I believe  he's saying that  the Times Square  guys  rape her.  I have no idea  where Bobo's going.  I've seen them  do that.  I apologize  to victim number  to a guest  She's a guest  and she came  in with good  intentions  and she has  to be party  to this.  Bobo.  I have feelings  he's going to  pick.  I do fuck  animals.  It means  I have a chance  to pitch. 
[03:43:00]  Oh my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Have you ever  heard of the  Queen's Motor  Inn?  No.  Would you  ever go  to a place  called the  Queen's Motor  Inn with  Bobo?  Never.  Never, right?  No.  Yeah.  See, Bobo,  you got nothing.  I don't take  people to that  crap hole.  I have nothing  to do with that  crap hole since  my uncle stopped  working there. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, look who's  fucking gold  digging off the  uncle.  You.  That's how I  see it.  And now he's  not there and  you say fuck  that place?  Oh, it's a  crap hole.  Why would I  want to pay  for a crap  hole like that?  Where would  you take  the lovely  victim number  two?  Where would  you take  her to  some kind  of place  to have  sex?  No, I  would, I  would, no,  because of her  being a cunt,  because you're a  cunt, I think I  would have to get  paid for worse. 
[03:44:00]  What?  I don't know  what he's  saying, but  he just  called her  a cunt.  This is, this  is horrible.  The only time  you're in  Queens is when  you're selling  that box slut.  The irony is  that this dating  show is sponsored  by Trojan, and  you will never  be able to fit  into one of  those.  That's all  I gotta tell  you.  If you're  gonna be like  that, I'd  rather have my 
[03:44:30]  brother give you  a pound in,  you bitch.  No, I wrote  Blumpkin.  Fucking ruining  our life.  Cindy Lou,  she gave me a  Blumpkin, you  should have  stuck around.  Just because  I would have  sex with my  brother doesn't  mean I don't  have feelings  too.  He fucked  his brother.  It might have  happened, we  don't know.  I'm sorry,  Bobo.  People are  saying Bobo  talks just like  his fucking  tweets. 
[03:45:00]  Incomprehensible.  How do you  ever know what  size a condom  is?  You never  use one raw  dog slot?  Is it Bobo?  Jesus.  Oh, that's  uncomfortable.  He's trying to  have a nice  contest.  I know.  Raw dog slot.  What does it  feel like to be  sold for a bad  plug?  What does it  feel like to be  sold for a bad  plug?  This isn't even  fair now.  I feel bad for  this guy.  See, she  feels sorry 
[03:45:30]  for you.  I'm just joking  around with you,  Bobo.  I'm sorry.  See, she  pities you.  She pities  the fool.  Bobo, you  apologize too?  Don't do it,  Bobo.  Bobo, you  apologize.  She  apologized.  Would you  apologize to  her?  Go give her  a hug.  Don't do it.  No, no,  don't come out  from the curtain  yet.  You already  saw the real  side, Bobo.  There's no  turning back.  I've seen the  real side.  I know your  real side,  all right?  I'm right.  All right.  I'm right.  I know the  real side of  right.  All right.  Yes, Bobo?  Nobody's going  to your 
[03:46:00]  website, open  your asshole  and shove  what you're  worth.  Did Sideshow  Bob just  give you that  on a piece of  paper to read?  No, I've been  sitting here.  It's pretty much  close to how I  feel.  They're actually  just putting  into context  what he says  and thinks.  It's, yeah,  it happens all  the time.  Well, wow,  I don't even  know how to  continue. 
[03:46:30]  I don't know  how we're going  to pick a  winner.  I do.  Well, the  score's tied.  So do I.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Come on now.  I want it to be  like real life.  I want the one  who's here for  just the plug to  win.  That's exactly  what I feel.  I want real  life to happen.  There's a sweet,  innocent, lovely  girl.  Victim number  one.  Sexy little cutie.  She needs the  money.  Adorably cute.  Abused by men.  Sitting there.  She's been so  sweet to you,  Bobo.  How do you feel 
[03:47:00]  about her real  quick?  I feel that the  number one is  truly a nice  person.  Right.  And I feel  that she isn't  someone trying to  use me.  She does deserve  the money.  Right.  And what do you  feel about victim  number two?  Now, I feel  victim number  two is a  user and  it's just  got brought  here out of  her own  view.  Well, she  probably doesn't  even want to  be here.  In other words,  I'm smart.  Oh!  Hey, you're  dead again,  tiny.  Not all the  show's listeners 
[03:47:30]  are dumb.  You feel the  same way we  all do.  Yeah.  Not all these  show's listeners  are dumb.  Well, I think  I know who  the big winner  is.  Number two?  Well, it's  victim number  two!  Congratulations!  You're going  out on a date  with victim  number two.  A wonderful  lunch together.  Wow!  I think we  have a love  to meet  victim number  two.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back, go back.  Go back.  First, we have to  introduce you to  the girl you  didn't get to  go out on a 
[03:48:00]  date with.  Victim number  one.  Step up and  meet Bobo.  Here she is.  Bobo, what do you  give us your  first impression?  What do you  think of her?  I think she's  nice and I  feel upset that  I didn't get the  one that really  was the real  deal.  Of course.  It's the  Opie and  Anthony show.  She's really  here for you.  How else?  Bobo, isn't  she cute?  Look at her.  She's cute.  Yes, she is.  She's your type.  I think you two 
[03:48:30]  would make a  good couple.  Yeah, but have  Bobo describe  her for the  radio audience.  Oh, that's right.  Bobo, describe  victim.  I can tell she's  not got a nice  complexion to her  skin.  Yeah.  She's got like a  dark brown hair  wearing these blue  jeans, black  shirt.  She looks like  she's got a pink  top on her knees.  All right.  No, no.  I think she's got  she's got like a  she's got like a  nice shape to her.  What do you mean  nice shape?  Yeah.  She's got like 
[03:49:00]  curves.  Can I ask you  now that you  didn't win, how  do you really  feel?  I'm really upset  actually.  I was I thought  it would be fun.  It'll be fun.  I'm not doing much  anything else right  now.  Just waiting for a  job to come in.  Why didn't you  pick her, Bobo?  What's wrong with  you?  They didn't let me  pick.  Bobo, I got to  ask another question  here.  A little more about  her body and then I  got a follow up.  Oh, I think she's  got.  What about the  boobies?  She's got nice  size boobies.  What about the  eyes? 
[03:49:30]  Her eyes are  beautiful.  What about her  ass?  She does have a  nice ass.  She does has a  nice ass.  And Bobo, it's  only fair.  Is there a flaw?  And if there  is, please tell us  what it is.  Oh, that sucks.  It's part of the  contest.  It was in the  rules.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I don't know if  there really is a  flaw.  Except for that  she didn't win.  That's not a flaw  for her.  It's that she  didn't win.  If you had to  pick a flaw, I  guess.  Just if you had  to.  We understand 
[03:50:00]  she doesn't have  one, but if you  had to.  I don't know.  Maybe, maybe, I  guess, maybe she  didn't have much  luck.  That's fucking  brilliant.  That's brilliant.  We're so on the  money.  Fair enough.  All right.  Are you ready to  meet the girl that  you're going out on  a date with?  Bobo?  Yeah, I'm ready to  meet the one who  I'm stuck with.  Who I'm stuck with.  All right.  Let's bring her  in to meet. 
[03:50:30]  Should Bobo?  You've got to get  up and hug.  And get a microphone  on Bobo, please.  Yeah, yeah, you've  got to hug.  I can tell you  she's got a chance  to make up for it.  I'll give her that.  She'll have a chance  to make up for it.  Oh, will she?  On the money, but  she'll have a chance  to make up for it.  How?  How could she  make up for it, Bobo?  If the date goes  well.  How would the date  go well?  What's your  interpretation of a  well date?  Well, first, the  date's got to  happen.  Yeah, it's going 
[03:51:00]  to happen.  I know if it goes  well, if I wind up  escorting her to  her house.  And doing what?  I'm saying if she  gives...  I know, right?  Fuck that.  What?  And doing what?  What makes a good  date, goddammit?  If she gives it up  at the end.  Because it means I  lived up to my end.  She wouldn't even  shake your hand  without hand  sanitizer next to  her. 
[03:51:30]  That's what she  said to me.  I know she's so  at the speed you  got a point to  her head.  Doesn't even know  the show.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you guys  are going to have  a lot to talk  about then.  You can catch her  up on the show  during your date.  Yeah, the big  hug.  There it is.  Your date.  Your date, girl.  He's hugging.  Did you see that  hugging day there?  Natural.  Freep.  Yeah.  I didn't see.  What's the hug? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He's like...  You know what it  is?  It's like the way  the orangutan  hugged in every  which way but  loose.  Right turn,  Clyde.  Yes, Clyde.  Hugging Clint Eastlash.  His hands  shoot straight up.  I love Dave  and Buster's.  It was your  good to win  something and  show some respect  to the borough  of Queens.  What?  You're going to  Queens?  No, I mean show  some respect to  the borough of  Queens and maybe  for once to 
[03:52:30]  know when the  Mets are home.  If you're going  to invite somebody  to a Mets game  on the day of  the game, you  got to know  when they're  home.  He's talking  down to her  like crazy.  But how could  she make a  word?  She's got a  chance to make  up for 1860.  How is she  going to make  it up again  there, Bobo?  She makes it  up.  I love that it  happened this way.  Maybe I've done  my part and I've  Who's the chakras?  The guy that was  writing awful shit  about you. 
[03:53:00]  And maybe  enjoy your date.  She realizes  how good of a  guy I am,  all right?  Oh, yeah?  I know, Bobo.  I feel bad.  She has to  realize how good  of a guy I am  and maybe if  she's nice and  doesn't, and  hopefully maybe I  probably maybe see  that she isn't a  user.  Maybe she's just  joking.  Yeah.  Victim number one,  are you okay?  You look a little  sad.  I might cry a  little when I  leave.  Did you need  the money? 
[03:53:30]  Did you need  the money?  Do you like  pools that are  heated much too  hot for the  weather?  Do you like a  theater in a  house?  Perhaps, what's  your poison?  What do you  like to drink?  I'd stick with  some rum.  A little rum?  I like that.  A little rum.  Sure.  You know what?  I think an invite  to the next  compound party  as a consolation  prize.  As a consolation  prize.  Damn.  I don't even  get that.  To the next  compound party.  Damn it!  I don't even  get that! 
[03:54:00]  Damn it!  That somehow  they managed to  find a way to  make you happy.  Bubbo's nipples  are erect, by the  way.  Yeah.  Bubbo, can we  see your nipples  please?  It's not your  penis, it's your  nipples.  No, no, no.  Please.  Oh, just a little.  I don't want to  feel good at that.  Just your nipples.  I don't like to do  things that are gay.  It's not gay, just  show your nipples.  I had sex with my  brother.  Are you in favor of  homosexuality?  Yes.  You said that.  I didn't. 
[03:54:30]  Yes, you did.  I didn't.  Ew, why are your  nipples poking  through?  I don't like that  his shirt has  wooden buttons on  it.  It's wooden buttons.  He has wooden  buttons.  I can only hope  they're found in a  fire later on.  Look at the  erect nipples.  Look at the chest  you're going to get.  Any chance of you  maybe rubbing your  hands on that hair  later on?  Courtney, go for  it, honey.  Maybe if she does  this, you're the  judge, you could 
[03:55:00]  always switch it  up.  That's true.  Courtney, if you  tweak those nipples  with your lips,  you could get that  date with Bobo.  Oh my God, he does  have a shirt with  Charlie Sheen.  Two and a half  men.  It's actually five  and a half men.  I am not changing  my decision because  the best thing that  could ever possibly  happen is him going  out with her on a  date.  It could not have  worked out better.  The hatred there is 
[03:55:30]  fantastic.  He wanted the other  girl so badly, yet  you don't get it.  That is a life  lesson.  You know what's  even better, though?  She got her plug in  and said, fuck it,  I'm out.  And the other girl  really stuck to the  gameplay.  And in life, she  should have won.  She should have won.  Unemployed.  We all thought she  was going to...  Yeah, she's got no  cash.  She's probably got a  boyfriend that works  at Mickey D's.  This one's driving a  Beamer back and  forth to work, I'm  sure.  Her father has  gave her a townhouse  for shits and  giggles.  And this one's  like, what tonight? 
[03:56:00]  I don't know.  I got some cheap  rum at home with  some basic cable.  Now, she has to  look forward to  getting date-raped  at your house.  Hey, now that's  something to look  forward to.  I didn't get things  handed to me like  you.  Oh!  I'm considering  going back to  school and...  Oh, what were you  saying?  We know you were  born with a  brother's dick in  your mouth.  See, that goes on  the whole sober  spoofing.  No one's going to  hand me any 
[03:56:30]  trust fund or  anything.  You do that.  You go back to  school on that  short bus.  Oh, shit.  Short bus.  She totally  nailed you right  there.  I won't get a  trust fund handed  to me.  I'll be struggling  on my own trying  to find a job.  I don't get a  trust fund as a  backup.  You don't have a  trust fund.  I hope I get a  job and I get the  return investment in the  form of success.  I fucking...  It's almost...  It makes me violently  angry.  His dumbness. 
[03:57:00]  Fucking, please.  Speaking of dumbness,  Rich Voss will be in  Boston this weekend.  But then he goes on  Twitter and just begs  for Giants tickets.  And begs for tickets.  Why did you do that,  Bobo?  I decided to quit  begging for tickets.  Oh, you decided to  quit?  I just quit begging.  I got in the patch?  Only because...  No, no.  Because this is New  York and they have  enough season ticket  holders to keep the  games on TV.  Right.  Because you know how  the NFL does that.  They won't show the  games if not enough  season tickets were  sold.  We know, we know.  So they keep the  games on TV. 
[03:57:30]  But I did get a fan  that was nice enough.  Oh, shut the fuck  up!  To give me tickets.  No one cares.  Where are you going  on this date?  Dave and Buster's.  Dave and Buster's  right there in Times  Square?  Yeah.  Oh, that's wonderful.  That's by the gang  related shooting theaters,  right?  I don't know what you're  talking about.  Yeah, exactly.  That's awesome.  Dave and Buster's,  wow.  You gonna win her a prize,  Bobo?  Bobo, what's your  game?  What do you think  your best game is?  Whack-a-mole?  Ski-ball?  I'm not sure.  It's been too long  since I've went to a  place like Dave and 
[03:58:00]  Buster's.  Yeah?  And sometimes I kind  of need to play some  of the games, see what  I'm good at.  Yeah, take it easy,  y'all.  And believe me, I  understand.  I gotta see what I'm  good at.  And once I know the  game that I'm good at,  I just keep playing  that one.  Okay, so now are you  hoping to win it?  Even though you don't  like her.  David Buster's  Russian roulette.  Are you gonna win her  something and give it to  her like a real date?  And is it gonna be  sincere?  Yeah, it is.  All right.  I'm hoping that she'll 
[03:58:30]  be nice.  Well, she...  I'm hoping she'll be  nice.  Well, how about her  hoping you'll be nice?  You've been kind of a  scumbag.  I mean, I'll be nice to  her.  Would you have been  nicer to victim number  one?  I probably would have  been because she showed  nice in the beginning.  Yeah.  It takes two halves.  You know what they say,  it takes two to tango.  Bobby!  Bye, Bobby.  We just lost Bobby.  We just lost Bobby on  it takes two halves,  by the way.  Bobby, done, out. 
[03:59:00]  Toby dies.  It takes two halves.  That's true.  Yeah, it takes two halves.  For Bobo, that's  pretty impressive.  So, David Buster's,  and then, so you're  gonna sit down and get  a table and get a  little lunch?  What do you like to  eat at David Buster's?  I love the potato skins.  The potato skins and  cheese, right?  Yeah.  Those are good.  What do you like to  eat?  It depends what I'm in  the mood for at the  moment.  Pina colada.  Pina colada?  I will be drinking  heavily.  You know what I see,  though? 
[03:59:30]  I see one pina colada,  two straws, and you  two may be sharing.  What do you think  about that?  Nose to nose, right?  I think it's  looking at each other,  and then I want a  bowl of spaghetti  ordered, and I want  the scene from Lady  and the Tramp, where  you're eating the  same piece of  spaghetti, and then I  want Bobo to push  a meatball over to  her with his nose.  Why am I such a  faggot for knowing  this?  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  But you're like me,  that freaking  remembers movies.  Yeah, that's just  like you.  We are just kindred  spirits.  We're brothers from  different mothers.  Thank God.  We're not that much  different, if you  realize it.  Did you hear that?  We are both on  earth.  I'll give you that  much.  How many pictures do  you have of Opie and  Anthony in your  bedroom?  Oh, good one.  Do you stare at  every night?  I don't stare at the  pictures, they're just  there.  How many of them?  Just crotches.  Those are just two  pictures.  There's one of me with 
[04:00:30]  both of them.  And there is an  autograph.  That's when we were  tag teaming you,  right?  Remember I was buried  deep in your ass and  you were sucking Opie  off and we were  playing five card  stud on your back?  No, that wasn't  true.  Oh, okay.  That isn't true.  Oh, literal.  There's a picture of me  sitting next to them.  Oh, okay.  And there's also an  autograph though.  Is he missing?  He misses?  He missed about half  the station.  I'm just picturing him  going home and  tucking and wearing a  wig with lipstick and  dancing in the mirror 
[04:01:00]  with his fetal.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, would you fuck me?  I'd fuck me.  I'd fuck me.  Bobo, you do that  shit?  You ever tuck?  You ever tuck?  There's no need to  tuck.  Bobo, you ever, oh,  you can't tuck actually.  Yeah, you can't get  it around.  In order to tuck,  you'd have to curl into  the fetal position.  Yeah, right, Bobo?  Doesn't it suck  having a little dick,  Bobo?  Does it suck?  I don't know.  I've heard doctors say  it's not even small.  There's beds,  they've seen smaller.  Yeah, I bet they have 
[04:01:30]  during circumcisions.  No, they've seen it,  right?  I asked my urologist.  Your urologist?  I asked them openly  because I've known  they probably had to  have seen a lot.  Probably.  A urologist has probably  seen one or two penises.  You're right.  Very smart.  And I think...  Hey, Bobo.  Oh, God.  Have you seen...  Oh, God, that's...  Doesn't it look like  a breakfast sausage leg?  Sam is a prick.  He put on Apple TV  so it's on the big screen. 
[04:02:00]  And that's fully erect,  by the way.  That is Bobo's penis.  Yes, it is Bobo's penis.  And it does...  It looks like the front  has been smashed off.  And that's Bobo, what,  being sexy online?  Oh, you look good.  You've lost weight.  Punisher shirt.  Bobo's got the Punisher shirt.  What is it?  What is that?  You look dead.  Dude, you look like  a dead fucking Iraqi soldier.  I don't even know  how to take a picture  like that.  You did.  Well, that was my lame attempt.  Your eyes are glazed.  You look dead. 
[04:02:30]  That's a corpse picture.  That was me trying  to make a sexy looking face.  I don't know how to do that.  A damn female fan asked  for that and I didn't know  how quite to do that.  A female fan asked for it.  I'm sure on Twitter, right?  Because it said,  a girl.  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, what is that?  What is that picture?  A Bobo?  What are you doing there?  I see you're puckering up  a little bit.  Courtney, do you see those lips?  I do.  Those look like  luscious, juicy lips.  I know.  I like the way the nostril hairs  go over the top lip. 
[04:03:00]  Come right out of your nose.  Those are bridge cables.  Now, what were you doing there, Bobo?  No, she asked for  me kissing a camera.  Who's she?  A girl who wrote  by the name of  Flight Benefits on Twitter.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit, that's hilarious.  Jamie.  Did she send you pictures back?  We all know Jamie.  Yeah, I know about her.  She didn't send pictures back.  Jamie's a good egg.  And then,  what did Jamie then make you do  so she could laugh 
[04:03:30]  her fucking ass off  when she gets the picture?  Bobo, what's this, Bobo?  What is that?  Oh, eat a banana.  Oh, here you go, Bobo.  Here you go.  Let's reenact it live in studio.  Yeah, Bobo, there's a banana.  So, did Jamie make you do that, too?  And, Travis, I gotta yell at you  real quick.  Why would you attempt to catch that  when I just threw it?  Clearly, it was gonna hit Bobo's head.  Right, right.  He was not defending himself.  So, Bobo,  can you reenact the banana scene  in that photograph 
[04:04:00]  with a banana?  Yeah, he just threw it back at him.  Holy shit.  I'll try to.  I cannot even deal with  what is going on  in the studio today.  I even looked like  I wasn't so thrilled  about doing this on that photo.  Yeah?  Now, what did you do?  What did Flight Benefits  tell you to do?  No, eat that banana  like I was trying to eat  the banana in one shot.  Was there anything sexual about it? 
[04:04:30]  Like, eat it like a penis?  I don't know.  As if she must have thought  I was flushing.  Bobo, Bobo, shut up.  Blow the banana.  Just blow the banana  like you would like  one of these lovely ladies  to suck on your cock.  How would you like them?  Demonstrate to them  what would feel good  on your cock  with that banana.  Okay?  Keep going.  That's what you would like?  Don't bite the banana yet. 
[04:05:00]  We need a video  right now.  If this isn't on video  I swear  someone is going to die.  Okay.  Travis has...  Now, Bobo  show again  from the beginning  start.  Alright.  Your dick is just out.  It's that banana.  You are one of the beautiful girls.  What do you want her to do?  Go.  I kind of want her  to start off easy.  I don't know.  I guess  maybe her lips on her.  Stop talking.  Go ahead. 
[04:05:30]  Bobo is slowly  slowly putting  the tip of the banana  in his mouth.  It's probably about  a cold year.  Bobo looks like  he's done this before.  Bobo has excellent form.  I've never done this.  I've only watched it.  And you know what too?  Banana.  Very, very soft fruit.  Yes.  There is no teeth marks  in that banana.  Not one fucking tooth mark.  You know how to  use your lips  to cover your teeth  so you don't bite the dick.  I've watched porno before,  right?  Yeah?  I have, right?  What do you expect  from a guy that doesn't 
[04:06:00]  get the girl  so much to do,  right?  So much.  When he needs  to take out the poison.  What does he do?  Take out the poison?  Yeah, yeah.  Jerk off  while sucking a banana.  Yeah, yeah.  Obviously.  Perfectly.  You give a perfect  blowjob, Bobo.  Because I've seen it  and know what...  Bobo, you're invited  to the next compound party.  I've just seen it  and know what I want.  You know what you want.  You know how to get it.  Yeah, exactly.  Now let's see,  your ass is one of those  girls' asses 
[04:06:30]  and that banana  is your dick.  Go.  I'm kidding, of course.  I don't want to see you  stick that banana  up your ass.  I don't want to see it.  That's beyond me,  all right?  I'm sure it isn't.  With some coaxing,  it could be done.  We just don't have the time.  Ron and Fez are  going to be on  very shortly.  Hey, is this technically  the after show?  No.  Yeah, this is.  The best after show ever.  I don't think I would do that  even if my giant tickets 
[04:07:00]  for the 16th  were upgraded.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, he's just got  to fucking babble  about that.  He's challenging you.  He really is.  He tasks me.  He tasks me  and I shall have him  for it.  Bobo,  enjoy your date  with this lovely,  lovely girl  that you have  specially chosen  for this date.  Can I give him a tip?  Yeah.  That's all he has.  Like maybe saying  how to get the niceness  out of her.  She was saying  before the show  how she was really tired  and she just wanted  to go home  and go to sleep. 
[04:07:30]  So maybe  if you can take her  somewhere to go nap.  You guys could  probably see a movie  after Dave and Buster's  I'm thinking.  Oh, that would be good.  Maybe you could  take her to see a movie.  Not in one  of the gang theaters.  Nah, you could go  to the gang theater  and then rub her leg.  You gotta know  how to make a move.  If I find a movie theater  that's nicer  that I won't be likely  to get shot in.  I don't trust  those movie theaters  in that neighborhood.  Why, Bobo?  Neighborhood.  I keep hearing  about that neighborhood,  all right?  What's wrong  with the neighborhood? 
[04:08:00]  No, the gangs  that run those theaters,  all right?  I hear stuff.  I went to a high school  that had way too many  blacks with attitudes.  Isn't that a band?  Lacks with attitudes.  Lacks with attitudes, right.  That's how Tipper Gar  marketed them.  Did you get,  did you used to get bullied  by some of the  African-American students?  Some of them frightened me.  Not all, but some. 
[04:08:30]  I won everything he says  as a clip.  I think we went  to the same high school.  So, some of them  frightened you.  Yeah, I mostly see  like the vibe they give off,  like how they greet me.  Yeah, how do they greet you?  And stuff,  and how they talk.  A big punch in the face?  How do they greet you, Bobo?  Run your pockets, motherfucker!  Run your pockets!  Let me hold a dollar, retard!  Well, for one thing,  Let me see your cell phone!  There's one way  I knew for sure.  Wow.  If they obsessively curse, 
[04:09:00]  I know I couldn't trust them.  Ah.  Yes.  So, if it was like,  hey, motherfucker.  If they come up to you  and went,  hey, motherfucker.  Yeah, like that.  I didn't trust them.  And I didn't trust ones  that tried greeting me  with the N-word either.  How would they do that, though?  Why would they call you that?  I don't know.  They freaking,  they,  they,  those,  those kind of  freaking thing  that they,  they think it's some greeting.  They think you can just use it  as however they want.  It offends you?  It offends me.  Like,  you've never rewinded. 
[04:09:30]  We're always taught  not to use that word.  Right.  Like that.  And they're just using it  what they want.  What's wrong with them,  right?  They,  they don't want to be treated.  Why would they call you that,  though?  They don't want to be called that.  And you know what?  Let me tell you something.  When they call each other,  that it's,  it's a,  a term of endearment.  It's a greeting.  And if they're calling you that,  I would think that would be  kind of respectful.  Well,  yeah,  but the thing is,  it's not how I always,  it,  how I always thought of that word.  And all right,  I,  I always assumed that  it would bug them  from all the years of the, 
[04:10:00]  the,  the years that they've gone through.  All right.  What did,  what did they go through?  Well,  well,  some of their ancestors  gone through slavery.  So what did they go through?  And that was like an insult to them.  What did they go through, though?  I'm saying,  I think they would,  they would have more respect  and realize that they got,  that they were given this opportunity  for what their ancestors fought for.  setting the race cause back centuries.  Yeah,  we,  we are out of time,  by the way.  We gave you the opportunity.  We're,  we're gonna,  we're gonna have to wrap this up.  You two have a great time.  What, 
[04:10:30]  what?  Oh,  I got a plug.  Of course I do.  Yes.  This whole extravaganza.  Please get closer with triple tested  quality Trojan bearskin condoms.  Trojan America's number one  most trusted condom brand.  We want to thank Trojan  for putting on this shindig.  It's been fantastic.  You get to go out on a date  and make sure they get your info.  The next compound party,  you are cordially invited.  Thank you.  As a consolation prize  because I can't bear the thought  that you,  you didn't get the thousand dollars  because we just wanted to make this 
[04:11:00]  as evil as possible for Bobo.  Bobo,  any last words?  I don't want,  I don't want to know when that acts  like a twink.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  All right.  I guess we'll,  we'll see you all Monday  and have a great weekend,  everybody.  Tracy.  God damn it.  Damn it.  Oh God.  Oh,  she turned her head.  Oh God.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.
