<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about New York Comptroller candidate John Luthor, who had fired some of the hosts' DJ friends for what they deemed "Asian humor."  The hosts expressed their frustration at their failed attempts to have Luthor on the show.  This segued into a conversation about smoking, comparing past permissiveness (smoking on planes and in public) to current restrictions, and touching on their general views on government regulation.  They then announced upcoming guests: Victoria Gotti, Mike Rowe, and Jeffrey Ross, previewing Gotti's book and Ross's roast comedy book.  A significant portion of the early show was dedicated to the fallout from a disastrous promotional announcement for "WOW stickers," which had run out.  The hosts played a wildly offensive promo claiming they were sending out used medical waste breasts instead, sparking a debate about potential listener backlash and the inconsistent standards of their corporate overseers regarding offensive material.  An internal dispute over the wording of a show replay announcement (replay vs. encore) further fueled their complaints about management's seemingly illogical decisions. A breast cancer survivor even called in to support the hosts' controversial breast promo.  A news story about a stabbing and suicide was also briefly discussed, followed by Opie's impending divorce, slated for the next day, and light banter about personal lives and upcoming plans (including Opie's fly-fishing trip).

Mike Rowe, from *Dirty Jobs*, then joined the show to promote the new season.  The hosts discussed the show's longevity and surprising continued relevance, with Rowe attributing its success to viewer-submitted job ideas.  A humorous running gag involved guessing the weight increase of a mattress over time due to accumulated bodily fluids and other debris (the answer: 15 pounds over 10 years).  Rowe shared stories about the grossest jobs he'd encountered, including a harrowing window-washing experience and a sheep castration segment. He also discussed jobs deemed too depressing or gruesome for the show, like crime scene cleanup.

Victoria Gotti then joined the conversation, discussing her new book about growing up in the Gotti family.  The conversation covered misconceptions about her upbringing, the moment she learned about her father's imprisonment and his involvement in organized crime, the emotional impact of this revelation, especially regarding the killings he committed, and a poignant anecdote about a conversation with her father near his death.  She also detailed her brother's death, her encounter with the responsible driver, and the driver's subsequent disappearance.  The interview included humorous exchanges about her father's personality, his shyness despite his public image, his strict parenting, his complex relationship with his son, John Jr., Curtis Sliwa's accusations, John Gotti Jr.'s trial, and the public perception of her father. She promoted her book signing at F.H. Riley's and a possible future appearance at Opie's brother's restaurant.  A brief return to conversation with Mike Rowe preceded Gotti's departure.

A segment focused on listener response to the Victoria Gotti interview, which was overwhelmingly positive, although some listeners preferred more Mike Rowe.  The hosts discussed John Gotti's life and the Paul Castellano assassination in graphic detail.  They then transitioned to discussing John and Kate Plus 8, using crude and sexually explicit language to comment on Kate Gosselin.  Further topics included the Roman Polanski petition, the Red Sox clinching a wild-card spot, the hosts' colds, and a discussion about the attractiveness of various women, including a Swedish model, with comments about her age.

Jeffrey Ross, the roast comedian, then joined.  A caller’s question about Ron Benett’s disdain for roasting led to a discussion about the art of roasting, including knowing the subject, finding a "good sport," and unwritten rules.  Ross shared anecdotes from his career, including the Hugh Hefner roast (mentioning Gilbert Gottfried's controversial joke) and his first roast with Milton Berle. He provided a graphic description of Berle's penis size, discussed other roasters like Don Rickles and Pat Cooper, and recounted a tense appearance on *The View* with LaToya Jackson.  A caller identified himself as a Berle relative, leading to further discussion. The segment concluded with a bizarre, increasingly offensive impromptu roasting session involving callers, Opie, and Anthony, including "Ted the Roaster," whose jokes frequently involved child molestation.  A fabricated shepherd's pie order from Victoria Gotti for Opie's brother's restaurant served as a humorous concluding anecdote.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Dude, most people don't have the whole language obsession we do because they don't talk for a living.  So John Luthor to them is not as irritating as he does.  Well, that didn't make the air.  Why?  I don't have the mics on yet.  I want to be on the radio.  We were just commenting that John Luthor won here in New York, what, Comptroller or something? 
[00:00:30]  Comptroller.  Comptroller it's called?  I don't know why they call it Comptroller.  He's not in the same position he used to be in.  No.  Oh, okay, better.  Yes, that's what I thought.  Take care of all comps. Beautiful.  Yeah, comp.  John Luthor got some DJ friends of ours fired for some dumb little Asian thing.  Yeah.  Guys trying to, you know, make a living and make jokes and entertain their audience.  Making jokes.  You heard the story a million times.  But in this case, yeah, JV and Elvis were doing a little Asian humor.  One of the guys is married to an Asian. 
[00:01:00]  And John Luthor had a problem with that and rallied the troops and got DJs fired.  That's great.  Yup.  Well, now this ass has won some Comptroller election.  Comptroller.  And by the way, we have tried to get John Luthor on our show for, I don't know, for many years at this point.  Two, three years at this point.  Well, he didn't win Comptroller.  He's the Democratic nominee for Comptroller now. 
[00:01:30]  And he's got to run against the Republican now.  Okay.  Later, yeah.  All right.  Well, good for him.  Yeah.  Go for him.  Maybe he'll be preoccupied and leave DJs alone that are trying to entertain and make people laugh.  Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe he'll have bigger fish to fry.  And we wanted to educate the ass.  Yeah.  And politely, we called his people, you know, behind the scenes, like, look, we're not happy about this.  Yeah.  You don't understand what we do.  We don't understand what you do.  So you call us up and we'll explain. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Let's just talk.  That one still bothers me because, you know, I mean, they railroaded JV and Elvis.  They had a nice following.  They were doing very well in New York.  And this guy got involved.  And then a whole bunch of people that were upset by it that never even heard the show.  Yeah.  They weren't really upset by it, which is what happens in radio when people complain.  Yeah.  They're not upset by it.  They never heard it in the first place.  Of course not.  It's always some kind of form letter that they pass among themselves.  Sign this, sign this, sign this. 
[00:02:30]  And then, you know, the corporation, in this case CBS, they get nervous because it's like,  oh, my God, look at all these people that are angry.  They're not even angry.  They're just like robots just signing this dumb paper.  So there you go.  I got a really bad sore throat.  I was telling Anthony before the show.  And I think it has something to do with standing in a river.  In the rain.  In the rain.  Of course it does.  For five straight hours.  And I think it finally caught up with me.  Dude, you take your NyQuil.  You relax.  You have a cup of coffee. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  You got a fisherman's friend.  You just kind of relax.  You breathe in the lake and boom.  And washing that cool menthol right over the sore throat.  Dude, you know what?  You're fine.  Dude, I used to get beat up when I was a kid.  And where did that come from?  Dude, I don't know.  He'd have his cup of coffee, his fist, my teeth.  Maybe he likes coffee so much because he was throwing it on, you know, penises of young  boys that wanted to put him in his hiney. 
[00:03:30]  You just cannot get enough of the Bob Kelly impression.  I love Bob.  Fucking stupid Bob.  That dolt.  He was smoking in nature.  I'm like, will you stop?  Nature.  Just stop smoking in my face in nature.  And I support the smoker, even though I don't smoke.  Yeah.  But I think it's your right to smoke.  Of course.  Not in certain places.  No.  I even said in restaurants and bars you should be able to smoke.  And then you as the patron, if you're not into that, you know, in a free society like 
[00:04:00]  we have, you find a restaurant or a bar that kind of doesn't have the smoking thing going  on.  I'm kind of digging the no smoking thing.  I dig it.  It's great, dude.  It's great.  I dig it, Ant.  But, you know, you're into that whole gun thing.  No, I know.  You should allow the people to fucking kill themselves if they want.  I don't give a shit.  The problem is there's always that argument that they're killing everybody else in the  place.  Yeah, but you choose to go into those places.  But then how they got a lot of these things done, these laws and whatnot, well, the worker. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, but you as a worker could find a job that doesn't involve, you know, people smoking.  Yeah, I just don't like the government getting their nose in there.  Exactly.  Like Bloomberg did that.  If you have a restaurant or a bar and you decide you want a smoke-free environment, then  you should be able to do that.  And then you'd get people like me, like going into a bar and not having the clothes smell  like smoke when you go home.  Right.  And if people want to go in and smoke in another bar, they could do that.  Right.  It's the government getting in there and telling you, you know, what you should and shouldn't 
[00:05:00]  do and you eat or shouldn't eat, smoke, fuck, whatever.  Of course.  Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking.  Yeah, and no one in my family smokes, but, you know, you got to fight for that stuff.  Yeah.  Keep your nose out of things.  But who are we kidding?  That one is so long gone.  Oh, just, I mean.  There's no coming back from that one.  We've been around long enough to remember the time you took a flight and the whole flight  was filled with smoke. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because you got all those nervous flyers just puffing away.  That whole tube that you're sitting in up in the air is just full of smoke.  Because what do people do when they're nervous?  They reach for a cigarette in most cases.  Chain-smoking motherfuckers.  Dude, I totally remember as a kid people smoking on a plane.  I remember being on a fucking airplane and just, it's packed with smoke.  There's no venting that shit out.  No. 
[00:06:00]  It's just, you couldn't, from the back of the plane, there was a fog up to the front  where you couldn't even see, like, the sexy stew.  Ashtrays on a plane.  Yeah, the little flip-up ashtrays.  Doesn't that just seem like a fire hazard, too?  Of course.  And now when you go on one of those older planes every once in a while and you see the  old ashtrays.  The ashtray.  Or the razor disposal in the bathroom.  You're like, what?  How old is this plane?  I'm shaving.  Is this thing really in the air?  And how long is it going to stay up here? 
[00:06:30]  Shaving on the plane.  Right.  The other thing about smoking that was cool was sporting events when you were a kid.  Yeah.  Seeing your favorite team.  In this case, like the Knicks or the Islanders when I went to those games.  And you would see, it was almost like a cloud of smoke because it all would just kind of  rise to the top of the arena.  Cloud of smoke.  Concerts, too.  Concerts.  Yeah, you would see, like.  Yeah, that's even better, actually, because there were more smokers at concerts.  And it would look, you know, you'd see it in the stage lighting.  You know, the big beams of light would come down, and it wasn't from a smoke machine. 
[00:07:00]  No.  It was the smoke in the venue.  Everybody just smoking away, puffing away.  So.  The good old days.  Smoking joints.  You just.  Someone would just pass a joint down.  You'd get it.  It's like, oh, what's this?  Oh, well.  You'd just pass it back down.  Well, thank you very much.  Don't know where it came from.  Boys.  Don't know where that came from.  Boys.  Pass that along.  I know I'm your GM, but I want to be cool like you guys.  Pass the doobie.  Boop, boop, boop, boys. 
[00:07:30]  Didn't you share a little weed?  Yeah, we had a GM that might have shared weed with 17-year-old girls backstage at concerts.  Give me a poke off of that.  Would you give me a hit off of that marijuana cigarette, boys?  Does anyone know where ozone is?  I'm a little low.  I think I could use a doobie.  Right.  Boys.  Boys.  You have clients to talk to.  He was too busy trying to be famous in his own right.  Yeah.  Oh, did he love the limelight, that little bastard? 
[00:08:00]  Love the guy, though.  Oh, yeah.  But anyway, yeah, it's long gone because now what?  You're smoking little circles outside buildings.  That's about it, right?  Yeah.  And even that's got me like, bleh.  Can't stand walking through the clouds.  But Bobby, he annoyed me, though, smoking in that nature.  And then someone pointed out, you're yelling at him for smoking in nature as a huge semi goes flying by you guys.  Because I'm trying to say that we're in nature and I want to enjoy it. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you're right by a highway.  Yeah.  So there you go.  What do we got going on today?  We got Victoria Gotti coming in.  I've been looking through her book.  We got it yesterday.  It called up.  She's very intimidating.  Really?  Well, the one time I met her, she's very intimidating.  Yeah.  Well, she's the daughter of John Gotti.  And this family of mine is in the book.  She doesn't put up with shit.  And she's obviously a good writer because she wrote a column for The Post for a long time.  And she's written other books.  And I was unfortunate that I couldn't just read it.  So you're looking for questions and points to talk about. 
[00:09:00]  But I read the whole first chapter, too.  It starts off with her dad's funeral.  It's fucking great, man.  I mean, this is a family you want to hear about.  It's not some boring family history.  It's like these are people you want to read about.  Sure.  So what I've read of it so far is great.  And The Post has installments every day.  And today's the last one.  Kind of promoting her book.  And it's got like two pages of just like her book in The Post every day.  It's fucking great.  Wow.  So I'm looking forward to her talking.  Yeah, excerpts is the word.  Yeah, she's coming in.  We also have our old friend Mike Rowe. 
[00:09:30]  Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  I was kind of scared that he was sailing off.  You know what I mean?  We talk about this a lot where we get these guys sort of on the way up.  I mean, Mike Rowe was really – he was happy when we met him.  But then he really started getting big with the commercials and everything.  Some of the Ford commercials, yeah.  And then we didn't hear from him for a while.  And I go, man, I think we lost another one.  Yeah, could be another one.  But no, he's coming in today, man.  New season of Dirty Jobs starts – I was going to say starts last night because I saw it last night. 
[00:10:00]  When does it start?  Oops.  October 6th.  Ah.  Discovery Channel.  That's not far off, like a week.  So we're going to catch up with Mike Rowe, and then our old pal Jeffrey Ross will be in.  He wrote a book, right?  Yes, he did.  It's called I Only Roast the Ones I Love.  And again, I've only perused it.  He's going over a lot of his roasts.  Because Jeff is probably the king of those –  The premier roaster.  I wouldn't say that.  I would say the king of those roasts.  I would say the premier roaster.  Just like you'd say when I say a couple pages, you said excerpts. 
[00:10:30]  Excerpts.  You use the fancy, gentlemanly words.  Yes, I try.  I'm the layman.  Yeah, Jeff, his book's very funny from what I hear.  I haven't read the whole thing.  I look at my picture in there, of course, being the pompous asshole I am.  Oh, you've got a picture of the book.  Why wouldn't he put his celebrity friends in?  Ooh.  Yeah, why wouldn't he, Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Who else is in there?  I didn't really notice.  Oh, you just looked at you?  Yes.  Jeff told me you're on page so-and-so, and I went, voot, right to that page.  Voot.  You missed a point I'm making.  Jimmy didn't put his friends in his book. 
[00:11:00]  Really?  Well, it seems that some friends didn't see the paperback edition, and how the first photo  of us ever taken together is in the back of that.  Oh, wow.  I thought you got me back.  I was talking about satellite radio.  Look at that.  You got me back bad.  Really?  Of course.  Oh, that's very nice.  Yes.  I don't believe we have a paperback here.  I apologize.  It's okay.  I accept it.  I apologize.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  So it's Whip Them Out Wednesday, and we just heard that the WOW stickers that the company  was nice enough to get for us, Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  We're not beating them up today.  We're not hitting them with the newspaper.  But they're sold out.  Sold out.  And we barely talk about getting WOW stickers on the actual show.  It's in promos when we go to break and stuff, and you guys have been sending in those  self-adjusted envelopes, and we ran out.  Yes.  But there's a new batch that has been ordered, and they're coming in very soon, I guess.  How many?  10?  12?  I think they might get a couple hundred this time.  I have.  One.  Three. 
[00:12:00]  And Steve wanted to make a promo.  Oh, my God.  This is what it's leading to.  Wanted to make a promo about what I just said, basically.  Yeah.  That we don't have WOW stickers right now, but we will soon.  Hang in there.  So keep sending in your self-adjusted stamped envelopes.  Yeah.  Now, boy, there aren't many things we are afraid to touch on on this program.  We joke about everything. 
[00:12:30]  In the proper context, I believe anything could be funny.  I've said that in interviews.  I've always asked about the line.  You know that?  We're always asked about the line.  Where's your line?  Do you have a line?  And the truth of the matter is, I don't have a line in context.  There are certain times you just go like, I don't want to talk about that, or let's  leave that alone.  You know?  But in certain contexts, anything can be funny.  Whether it affects you personally, whether it's disgusting, offensive, tasteless, whatever. 
[00:13:00]  In certain cases, I believe anything could be funny.  Sure.  This, though, we gave this a little preview before the show today, and we each gave each  other the butthead look.  After it was done, we just kind of, uh, uh, uh.  You're just throwing it on the channel without any comments?  Yeah, without any context, without any, like, joke or, I don't know. 
[00:13:30]  To me, it was just kind of, this can be nothing but trouble.  I, I agree with you.  Well, let's take a listen to this thing.  Yeah.  Something we probably won't be playing on a regular basis.  No.  The Opie and Anthony show has run out of wow stickers, but rest assured, we will be getting  another shipment soon.  Until then, we still want our listeners to enjoy the gift of bosoms, so instead of stickers,  we're sending out tits.  All right, tits!  Ugh, that's gross!  Are those from Olivia Newton-John? 
[00:14:00]  Aw, fuck this!  We sent our interns down to the medical waste bin behind the plastic surgeon's office  to look for the best breasts possible.  I think I found something!  Oh yeah?  What'd you find?  I think they're Christina Applegates.  We'll keep sending them until the dumpster's empty or until we get our wow stickers.  So keep sending those self-addressed stamped envelopes to Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony show, attention wow stickers, 1221 6th Avenue, 36th Floor, New York, New York,  1-0-0-0-2-0.  All right! 
[00:14:30]  A box of wow stickers!  Holy fuck!  Is...  Is that Lance Armstrong's testicle?  That's my favorite part of the whole abominable bit, is that music in there.  It's so unnecessary.  The whole thing is so unnecessary.  It's, uh...  Yeah, it's just...  It seems to me if that played over and over again as a promo, that there would be some trouble. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, and I'm never going to figure out these corporate guys.  I finally came to the realization, because they kind of have a problem with nudity on our show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they approved that.  You know that this, that they just approved, could get us in a lot of trouble.  Yeah, they approved that.  And now that we're acknowledging that, that we shouldn't get in any trouble whatsoever, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  But if we have girls touching each other in studio, and they want to touch each other, that could be a problem. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, that, first of all, isn't going to get us in trouble.  No!  Girls having fun, consensual sex, even here in the studio.  Right.  If they want to diddle each other, if they want to suck on each other's genitalia, whatever.  But, something like that, if it plays over and over again, it'll have enough exposure where somebody is going to hear it and go,  oh my god, they're making fun of a tragic disease, and oh my god, my mother, my sister, whatever. 
[00:16:00]  And then they're going to call and maybe rally some troops up, and there's going to be a bunch of pink ribbons marching outside the fucking studios.  Yeah.  They're going to be marching lopsided.  But they approve that.  Jesus, H. Christ.  But they approve that.  They're all going to be leaning to one side, but still, they still could get the job done.  Yes!  And then they don't let us have women in here to just toy with each other. 
[00:16:30]  That's why, Danny, I don't go to these meetings anymore.  Me and Ann, we can't be bothered with these silly corporate meetings.  Oh, the other thing is just hysterical.  Because their logic just doesn't make sense.  I know they're working hard for us, and I think they get bummed out when we kind of beat them up a little bit, but you know.  How much time was spent on the replay encore argument or discussion?  Well, see, you're going to get them in trouble, though.  No.  You're going to get the boys in trouble.  Hold on.  No, no. 
[00:17:00]  They shouldn't get anyone in trouble because let me tell you why.  They're going to get the boys in trouble.  Because it's our fucking show, and they are conveying to us what happens at a meeting.  I don't want our boys wasting time with silly conversations.  Semantics.  Like the one that somebody around here just told Anthony and I before the show.  This is fantastic, by the way.  Tell Jimmy.  I want to get Jimmy's natural reaction.  All right.  Jimmy, this sounds fantastic.  Somebody hold up there.  Somebody just tell me.  You don't even have to vocalize it if you're scared. 
[00:17:30]  I understand that.  How many minutes were spent on this particular topic for the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  Somebody, somebody.  I see people weren't.  About five minutes.  About five minutes.  Knocking this one around.  Knocking this around.  Listen to this.  You know how we have our show live from 6 to 11 every weekday morning, followed by Ron  and Fez, and then after Ron and Fez, there's the Opie and Anthony replay. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Right.  It's been the Opie and Anthony replay for many years.  Wait.  Could we play maybe a promo that says just that, just to hammer this home?  Do we have that?  Something that just says, yeah, Opie and Anthony replay.  Before we move on from the wow promo, too, Ant, just hold that thought because this is important  to the discussion there.  Scott in Hoppog writes, guys, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, you morons.  Oh, great.  That's a good one, too.  So the promo couldn't come in at a better time, man.  Fantastic.  What? 
[00:18:30]  Tomorrow starts October.  And we're going to run the Let's Find Breasts in a Dumpster Wow Sticker promo.  Naming celebrities that have lost their breasts to a tragic disease.  And we're going to run that on, yeah, it's fantastic.  Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Yeah.  So it's tomorrow.  All right.  Here is one of the replay promos.  Okay.  Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, right after the Ron and Fez show, it's the Opie and Anthony  replay.  If you're in other parts of the country, fucking figure it out. 
[00:19:00]  All right?  It's either subtracting a couple hours, whatever.  So three, three, whatever.  You got it.  So remember, Ethiopian Anthony, you can check out the O&A replay beginning at 3 p.m.  Eastern, noon Pacific on Sirius 197XM 202, the virus.  All right.  I recognize all those voices.  I hope most of the listeners did.  I have big celebrities in that promo.  Yeah.  For the replay.  For the replay. 
[00:19:30]  Which is when they replay our show.  Right.  Now, Jimmy.  Replay is kind of a negative word.  Replay.  It's a negative word.  What's negative about it?  I don't know.  It means to play again.  Yes.  Let's look at the instant replay.  To play again.  No.  No.  No.  You only play the best plays over again.  Yes.  Wait.  You only play.  Does that make sense?  You only play the best plays. 
[00:20:00]  Ah, whatever.  It's replayed.  Right.  When you're watching a sporting event, they're not replaying, like, mundane, who gives a shit  plays.  It's called an instant replay.  Yeah, yeah.  When you watch an instant replay in sports and football, it's a very exciting moment.  Of course.  They don't usually just, you know, instant replay something crappy.  And the prefix R-E does not imply negative.  Right.  It doesn't imply bad to play again.  Replay.  Well, maybe we don't got this right. 
[00:20:30]  Is that about what was said in the meeting?  As I look around, somebody different nodding their heads.  Yeah, that's pretty much what they're saying.  Wait, Steve.  Steve throws his head up and his eyes just went up like, oh my God.  Well, I don't want to misrepresent this.  What was said?  And by the way, you weren't the one that brought it to our attention.  No, I certainly wasn't.  But I'm dragging you into this.  Yeah.  So it makes it very confusing who should be fired.  The ONA replay has a negative connotation to it. 
[00:21:00]  And it should be the ONA Encore.  Encore, Jimmy.  Encore.  It should be called the ONA Encore.  That fucking stinks.  And I'm going to tell you why.  Encore, to me, does not imply  the same thing again.  An encore implies an additional thing that is different.  So when they say, encore, encore, 
[00:21:30]  they don't say, come out and redo the entire act over again.  Well, there's an encore presentation.  Yeah, you're right.  Actually, you're right.  There is.  But replay is much better.  It's not negative.  There's no negative comment.  It's simple, direct.  There's no negative about it.  How about this?  Whatever.  It's a whatever argument.  It's like, why are you semantics?  Right.  I don't care which one they use.  I replay.  I do care that they're spending time discussing it.  Opium Anthony replay is simple.  It's directed to the point.  Yes.  What are you doing?  Listening to the replay.  Right.  Who's going to say, come on, I'm listening to the encore presentation? 
[00:22:00]  Prism experience.  This is not fucking masterpiece theater.  Have you just heard the promo that we did?  It's a piece of garbage.  It's a fucking replay.  Encore.  I am listening to the encore presentation of the Gregory and Tony program.  Brought to you by.  It's fucking nonsense.  Four hours of horse shit again.  That's what they should call it.  Hey, when does four hours of horse shit again start?  I like that. 
[00:22:30]  Brought to you by some kind of soap that washes the duty stains.  Out of your underwear.  Brought to you by Dove Facial Cleanser.  Facial Cleanser.  Four hours of horse shit again.  I nominate that that implies honesty.  Right.  We should.  You know, that's the discussion they should have had down the hall.  Four hours of horse shit again.  Here you go, fuckers.  Yeah.  Yes.  I love that.  See, you should just go over the top.  Like, to discuss encore versus replay.  Those guys have just run out of things to talk about with the staff of the O.P. 
[00:23:00]  Anthony show, I do believe.  That's what it is.  So we push for, if it's not going to be replay, encore is off the table.  Four hours of horse shit again or garbage redo, like in Apocalypse Now.  Redo.  Rehashed verbal rubbish.  I like that.  That's good.  I like that one.  Right.  Ah, whatever.  They can't call a replay a replay?  And this, these now are machines.  I want to call it the instant encore. 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  That is what they need to be called now.  Instant encore.  I want to play a sound from my instant encore.  Man.  Hey, where are the white women at?  There.  That came from my instant encore.  Holla.  The, wait, wait.  What's it called?  Oh, when you, when you recreate.  Oh, the sound recreation machine.  Yes.  I like that.  The sound recreation machine.  Oh, they're a bunch of fucking, uh, on-tards.  The management are on-tards. 
[00:24:00]  Encore!  That's good.  That's who listens to our show.  A gentleman in tuxedos with a monocle.  Encore!  Encore presentation.  We'd like an encore presentation of the AIDS jokes and fart noises.  You're not saying an encore presentation the right way anymore, Jimmy.  Oh, how is it?  You were doing an encore presentation.  Encore!  What time does the encore presentation begin?  Encore!  I'd like to pour myself a cup of tea and have a crumpet with a shot of jizzum on it. 
[00:24:30]  Could you ejaculate onto my crumpet, sir?  Before I miss the encore.  The encore presentation is starting, and I don't have a fat, retarded girl to throw rocks at.  You know those asses that live before us fucking ate jizzum for some dumb medical reason.  You know?  Yeah, jizzum.  It cured nightmares.  Yeah, some dumb thing.  So they're all just gobbling jizzum thinking it's gonna... 
[00:25:00]  It cures the vapors.  Right.  Keep the nightmares away.  Oh, fuck.  Well, I want to thank...  Do you have a current re-encore promo?  I'd love to hear it.  Oh, Bobo.  I want to thank management for giving us some material today.  That's right.  Encore presentation.  And I hear this a lot.  Well, you know, they're working hard for you guys.  They don't really appreciate it when you beat them up.  Well, then, fucking work on your skills and get a radio show.  What do you want from me?  Fiddle sticks.  Right.  What the fuck?  Excuse my language.  Yeah.  If it comes to our attention that you're discussing whether it should be called an instant replay 
[00:25:30]  or an encore presentation, you're gonna get beat up a little bit.  I'm sorry.  My idea, I think that we really...  I think replay is just too soft and flaky.  Four hours of horseshit, dot, dot, dot, again.  Again.  That's the name.  Yeah, it should just be something completely over-the-top outrageous.  I think the dot, dot, dot should come before...  Sorry.  Slingblade.  Oh.  When did he do that?  Medulla oblongata.  That's when he's having a little party at the house with the boys.  Oh, I don't even remember.  Right before he throws them all the fuck out. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  That's when...  Oh, Kevin from...  I'm sorry.  It's over now.  Kevin from Connecticut...  It's over now.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, how about you guys just call it here?  Here.  Here.  Here.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Yeah, we got some breast cancer survivors on the line.  Let's be very nice to this woman, Kim.  Kim in Indiana.  How are you?  Hi, Kim.  Good morning.  I'm good.  Hi, Jimmy.  You sexy bastard.  Thank you, Kim. 
[00:26:30]  Jimmy.  So, I was listening to the breast cancer promo before I left the house this morning.  Yes.  It's hysterical.  Do not let these one-titty bitches call and harass you guys.  Oh, my God.  If you can't laugh at it, then fuck them.  Why do you say that, Kim?  I have the right to say that because I am a one-titty bitch.  Oh, my God.  So, you survive breast cancer and you find that you're able to kind of look at it like 
[00:27:00]  any other horrible situation.  You can make fun of it even though you know how fucking awful it is.  Exactly.  Fuck them.  Fuck them if they can't laugh at it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, it's the timing's a little weird.  I mean, tomorrow starts the big, you know, breast cancer.  Awareness.  Awareness month.  Yeah.  And this thing was handed in to us.  Yeah.  You know, dumpster diving for breasts.  I mean, Jesus.  Yeah, that seems a little harsh.  Especially in lieu of wow stickers.  Not even important things.  No.  Now that I'm pushing 40, you know, maybe we could go a little. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, you are.  You're pushing it right out the back window.  Did you run past it?  I'm not pulling it off anymore, am I?  No.  Yeah.  I didn't think so.  Wow, you look really old for your age.  Well, fuck, I got to start using my real age and then you'll be impressed again.  All right, Kim.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good day.  There goes Kim.  Call it regurgitation.  Well, you get our point.  Yeah.  Anything else happening with the meetings?  Anything else we've missed? 
[00:28:00]  I got a spy report.  Do you?  I got a Ron and Fez spy report.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Spy report.  Spy report.  Spy report.  It's the Ron and Fez spy report.  You know, we can't take credit for that.  But someone wrote me this at 11 a.m.  11 a.m. yesterday, I would believe, because it hasn't happened yet today.  You're going to hear a name that's going to scare you, but don't worry.  What?  I got this under control.  All right. 
[00:28:30]  Spy report.  This was written to me.  During Mel's speech.  That's the name that scares you, I understand.  Yeah.  Wow.  He said, it's great to have Howard on board and, of course, Oprah.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, good.  He made no mention of any other shows on either platform.  That's great.  Wow. 
[00:29:00]  You sure he said that?  He probably meant to say Oprah, and he slipped out to Opie and Anthony.  And of course, Opie and Anthony were so happy.  He couldn't recover.  That would be our luck, too, you know?  Oh, and a second spy report came in five minutes later from the same individual.  Oh.  Did he say individual?  Individual.  And you guys are listed first on a screen that says, post-merger programming renewals and 
[00:29:30]  announcements above Oprah, Rosie, NBA, and others.  And then this person wrote, more gooder.  That's great.  Well.  So there you go.  Wonder who that is.  I just made that up.  Did you?  No.  Oh, I was feeling good for a second.  No, that's pretty cool, though.  Where did my name come up during the talk?  Oh, Jimmy.  Let me scroll, Jimmy.  It must have.  It's got to be here somewhere.  There has to be an oversight. 
[00:30:00]  Somewhere.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll,  scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  I'm still scrolling, Jimmy.  It's got to be in here somewhere.  And then I'll read some of my emails today.  What the hell?  And then Tom Chiasano.  Remember Tommy?  Sure.  Who could forget?  I don't think we ever called him Tommy, but.  The wonderful Tom Chiasano from K-Rock.  He had the pleasure of working with us.  Yes, he did.  He did.  It was a pleasure, right?  It certainly was.  I saw that he was a little sad when he was announcing that he was leaving. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  Couldn't hear it with the heel clicking.  He couldn't be fucking happier.  He fucking took angel wings and threw out that fucking 14th story.  I've never seen anyone happier to leave a building.  He left that smoke that cartoon characters leave when they leave something very quickly.  Dude, I was talking to him.  It was just his hair and suit.  He had run out so quickly.  His hair and suit were still standing there.  He heard a ricochet sound effect.  Pew, pew. 
[00:31:00]  He was fucking out of there.  He fucking left so fast.  The C and the B fell off the wall.  The S remained.  In case anyone didn't get it.  You know, I was having a little problem with that joke, Jimmy.  Thank you for explaining because now I'm in.  Oh, my God.  So I told Tom Chiasano, because I haven't talked to him in a while, and he used to bore us with his fly fishing stories.  They were terrible.  No way.  He was a fly fisher?  Did you ever pay attention? 
[00:31:30]  I never paid attention.  He would spill his guts out to us how he enjoyed golfing and fly fishing.  That was his thing.  I knew about his golfing.  Yeah.  But fly fishing, wow.  He is a fly fisherman, an angler, as Bobby likes to say.  Dude.  And so I went back and forth with Tommy a little bit here, and I told him I went fly fishing for the first time.  And he wanted to know where, and I told him Roscoe, New York.  And then he wrote this back.  I made that trip once as well.  Caught one fish. 
[00:32:00]  It's the end of the season, you know.  If you ever want to get serious about it, and this is where I bring it to the table today, because this will annoy Jimmy especially.  If you ever want to get serious about fly fishing, I know a couple of different lodges in Montana.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine traveling to Montana to fly fish?  Montana.  With a fucking fishing pole?  Do you bring your worms as carry-on?  There's no worms in fly fishing, Jimmy. 
[00:32:30]  Look, I got some early morning earthers.  What are they called?  Some juicy, what are some worm names?  Bloodworms.  Yeah, it's a good bloodworm.  Oh, it was raining.  I pulled some bait out of the yard.  Yuck.  Did you?  What a fucking horrible hobby that is.  But haven't you learned anything?  It's all about flies.  You don't use worms.  No, no worms.  And then you stick the flies all in your wacky little fucking hat.  Bob told me that the guy catching the fish with the fucking trout was throwing chum in the water and then just dipping worms.  And those asshole fish were grabbing it by the fucking bushel full. 
[00:33:00]  Didn't, wasn't that where, what's his name used to go?  That news guy?  Who?  With the Montana crotch rat.  Oh, fuck.  Charles Osgood?  Yeah.  No, the other guy.  Carole.  Yeah, yeah.  Charles Carole.  And he had like a chick up there.  He had another fucking wife or some shit.  Yeah.  And wasn't that Montana, though?  And he used to go fishing up there.  I do believe.  He must have been a fly fisherman.  The elusive trouser trout.  That guy was traveling the country and then it comes out after his death that he had another wife. 
[00:33:30]  Believe you.  God bless the guy.  The elusive furry trouser trout.  You know, if E-Rock runs down that disc.  If E-Rock runs down the disc, that kind of embarrasses people.  There's one on there.  You want to go old school?  Oh.  There's a Montana crotch rat.  Crotch.  Right, yeah.  What was it again?  Montana crotch rat bit.  That's from the Montana crotch rat.  And then Tommy just writes, Tom Chiasano.  He doesn't like Tommy, I'm sure. 
[00:34:00]  My best to Aunt Jimmy and Kenny and the rest of the crew, Tom.  Ah.  So Tom's doing well.  How's he doing?  I mean, what is he doing with himself?  Is he...  That was the first time I talked to him in a long time.  I mean, at first he was just playing golf and just enjoying, you know, his time off.  I mean, he wants back in.  He was forced out.  The Don is semi-retired.  That company forced Tom Chiasano out when this fucking guy...  Look, man.  Howard was a powerhouse at, you know, K-Rock.  You can't deny that.  But Tom Chiasano knew how to take that and make a lot of money for the company. 
[00:34:30]  And then they fucking pushed Tom out the fucking door.  Yeah.  Just like that.  He didn't want to leave.  No.  He had a couple good years left in him.  And all the time and money he brought into the company, that should have been good enough  to let the guy, you know, stick around a few more years.  And, you know, dedicated right to the end.  Even when he saw the wheels just fucking coming off of that station.  Yeah.  The wheels were coming off.  And he was just dedicated to getting, like, advertisers in there.  He was still rah, rah, rah.  Yes. 
[00:35:00]  Good soldier, that guy.  Yeah.  You can't, you know, you can't have loyalty.  It's too bad you can't.  No.  Because that was a loyal guy right there.  Yep.  Even when Howard left, he hung in there and tried to make it work.  Yep.  With the format changes.  Right.  The fucking personnel changes.  The cutbacks.  Like I said, the wheels just flying off of that thing.  And he's there in the driver's seat.  And the company couldn't get rid of him faster to save a few bucks.  Yeah.  Unbelievable. 
[00:35:30]  I know times were tough.  But I'm sure there were guys that should have left way before, you know.  Yeah, in upper management.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, they never go anywhere.  Exactly.  So there you go.  By the way, just the last part of the fly fishing extravaganza video will be up today.  Because people are wondering when the fuck is this stupid thing ending.  It's like a mini-series.  You're running roots.  Well, you can't put up a 25-minute.  If you study YouTube, you can't put up a 25-minute video. 
[00:36:00]  That is true.  People just want to see clips.  You can't put it up in parts.  So the last part will be today, finally.  What else is going on?  Well, quickly, I think that savage killed himself.  Yeah, the guy.  What happened?  So you got a black guy and a white tourist.  No, he was a Spanish guy from the Bronx.  Spanish guy from the Bronx.  That was a Spanish guy?  Yeah, I believe so.  Yeah.  The picture I'm looking at, all right.  Yeah, he looked kind of like a studious young, but I heard they bumped into each other. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, I heard he was mouthing off and squared off to fight with the guy.  He was ready to fight.  Yeah, he wasn't a fucking tough guy.  Yeah, he was like a...  Who was the tough guy?  The Spanish kid.  Okay, that's it.  Like, he squared off, took his jacket off and squared off to fight the guy.  I'm so fucking confused.  Ooh, that guy.  The guy who did the stabbing was a black kid.  Black guy who had done time in the army.  Right, all right.  Spanish guy, they're walking by each other.  Yeah, that's what I was talking about.  The guy who stabbed.  Okay, right.  They bumped.  And then the Spanish guy, they got into like... 
[00:37:00]  Who got bumped.  Yeah, who got bumped.  They got into a verbal altercation.  And then the Spanish guy took his jacket off and walks up to this guy like he wants to fight now.  And the black guy just pulls out this big knife and four times right in the chest.  And that was it.  And then walked away for a little bit.  And then went, oh, I think I dropped my cell phone.  Turned around, picked up his cell phone, and then slowly walked away as a tourist snapped a few pictures of him. 
[00:37:30]  They identified him.  I guess a cop had served with him in the military and said, I know that dude.  Identified him.  And they tracked him to his girlfriend's house in Philly.  And apparently found him dead.  6 p.m. last night.  We were talking yesterday.  I said, this guy probably has no idea he's in the paper yet.  And by that point, he probably didn't.  It was 6 a.m.  He's dead.  And he fucking killed him.  Even though, like, you may...  I don't know.  I didn't see the video.  There's a video of it. 
[00:38:00]  Like, probably a grainy surveillance video.  But, you know, if the guys were going to fight and you just panicked, there might have been a self-defense scene.  Yeah, you never know.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  Maybe the guy was a little kooky.  Maybe he felt threatened.  And it's kind of hard to defend, though.  Four on the chest with a knife when the guy's just kind of squaring off to fight you.  But you just never know who you're messing with.  That's what sucks.  Someone bumps into you.  You know, your first reaction is you want to punch the person.  But you never know.  Well, you go, excuse me.  And you move on your way. 
[00:38:30]  That's pretty much it.  Because some people are too little...  Wound up a little too tight.  That's coming from me.  I bump into old broads all the time because I refuse to move out of the way.  And they refuse to move out of the way.  And, man, we have some fucking collisions.  We just plow over them like a lineman.  And then they turn around in shock.  I'm like, well, what?  You could have moved too.  I don't know what to tell you.  And I kick their little dog and I go home.  Yeah, leave.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  So he's dead.  Yeah.  You think he killed himself because he saw that they were closing in on him?  That's kind of what they're saying.  Looks like he committed suicide.  Ah, suicide.  Man, that's mission suicide.  Yeah.  So we don't have to worry about any trials, any ridiculous defense attorneys, things like that.  Good.  That's the way every case like this should end.  Like the good old days.  The perp just kills himself. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, let me say hi to Jesse in Atlanta.  Jesse.  Hey, Ope, it looked, those fly fishing pictures you got, looked like Bobby gained like half  his weight back.  He's not all skinny anymore.  Oh, boy.  That would be completely accurate.  The guy ordered what's called a hungry man breakfast.  Did he?  Yeah.  You got your hungry man, you got your eggs, boom, you got bacon, bang, you got some fucking 
[00:40:00]  home fries, you got your cup of coffee, dude.  And then he acts at the party, you know what, dude, you sit down, you go, hey, let me get  a hungry man, boom, bring it over right now.  I eat it, I kill myself.  Everybody's happy.  He had a huge stack of pancakes, which, by the way, I had too.  I had a fine stack of blueberry pancakes.  Oh, that works.  One of my favorites when I'm up early doing some horse shit athletic thing.  And then he had like a whole egg thing besides the pancakes. 
[00:40:30]  Besides the pancakes, sauces, fucking hash browns.  He had, he, the waitress brought over, here, oh, you don't even get to see, there's saddles  near you.  Go back, go back.  How appropriate a horse's ass by saddles.  Here's him order breakfast.  I would like a hungry man.  Okay.  Because I'm hungry.  Pancakes, pancakes, or waffle? 
[00:41:00]  Pancakes.  Okay, I'm ready, my eggs.  Zach Golden pancakes.  You got it.  Crazy.  Crazy.  I got like my women.  Nice.  You don't have to humor him.  He's not that funny.  He's just early.  He's all right.  He's cute.  See, he's pounding the paper.  Bobby, look at this moose.  It's a buffalo.  I thought that was Bob.  Anyway, it goes back.  It's a buffalo.  Did you say, Bobby, look at this moose?  Yeah, I did.  It's so obviously a buffalo head.  It looks nothing like a moose. 
[00:41:30]  No.  Unless you mean the guy from RG Comics.  I, uh...  Dude, you gotta...  In the video, I said it's...  Oh, wait.  Listen to this.  This is what I deal with.  That's Bobby blowing his nose.  Ew.  You really blow your nose.  Oh, it's disgusting.  I think I hate you.  What's this one?  What was that?  It sounded like a bottle rocket. 
[00:42:00]  That's Bobby blowing his nose in my video.  You're probably a blood vessel.  What does he eat, party favors?  You look horrendous in the morning, by the way.  Fantastic.  He really is all puffy in the morning.  Hi, Bobby.  What's going on?  The rest of the day.  We just met our guide, Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Hi.  That's Tony.  You guys can watch yourself.  That's Tony.  He's our tour guide for the fly fishing thing.  That will finally end today with the last video.  Wow.  And then we'll finally move on from this dumb match the hat shit.  That fucking blowing his nose really sounded horrendous. 
[00:42:30]  It was funny.  But I already got my next activity.  Oh, like somebody's in the river fly fishing.  Look at that.  I love the smell of nature.  We're going to be in that water in just a few minutes, huh?  Smell good nature-y.  Look at the smoke going by my face.  If you're not smoke, we're in nature.  This comes from nature.  No, just stop with the smoking.  We're in nature now.  Put out the cigarette.  We're about to have a nice nature experience.  We're going to be doing some fly fishing.  And you're smoking.  It's out.  It's out.  Sorry. 
[00:43:00]  There's giant vehicles.  You're bitching at Bobby for a cigarette.  There's giant vehicles just blowing by you.  Someone pointed that out last night in the comment section.  And when I looked back at these videos, I started laughing my ass off.  I'm like, yeah, I'm bitching about nature.  The semis are, I mean, no joke, three feet behind me.  I mean, there was no shoulder on this road.  No.  And we were in that river with semis just flying by.  It was like, I think it was a main fucking highway or something.  I think it was part of Route 17, matter of fact, right there. 
[00:43:30]  That Bobby is just an ass with his big hungry man breakfast.  He ate so much fucking food.  Once a hungry man, of course he does.  Look, I wanted to eat as much as he did.  Yeah, who doesn't?  Even with the blueberry pancakes, that was a stretch for me.  Got to have some self-control.  You got to try at least.  And then during breakfast, he's telling me, you know, me and my wife, we want to be that  older couple that is in shape, walking on the beach without our shirts on.  You know, without people making jokes, you know, footprints in the sand, and Jesus, he 
[00:44:00]  carries you, boom, you get to where you got to go during the toughest part, he's the  footprints in the sand, boom, bang, you're there with Jesus.  As he's eating two breakfasts.  Breakfast.  Breakfast.  Breakfast.  No, it's breakfast.  Oh.  There's not, there's not an, it says, it's the STS.  I don't just enjoy one breakfast, I enjoy a couple of breakfasts. 
[00:44:30]  That sounds like, like ghosts.  How many breakfasts can you enjoy in one evening?  Or morning.  Breakfast.  That's the way you say it.  Like some breakfast, please.  I'll have two breakfasts.  Can I, I gotta, I gotta defend myself because, uh.  I'm on a track of you, Gregory.  No, no, no.  My HD flip was actually pointed at the, uh, buffalo.  Yeah.  And when I said, look at the moose, I was actually looking at Bobby, so. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  So it's a little confusing.  I just, I thought it was hysterical that you would just, like, just look at that, look  at that moose.  I think it's hysterical.  To be honest, I really thought it was a moose at first, and then when I looked closer, I knew  it was a buffalo, but it was very early, Anthony.  We were up for maybe 15 minutes.  I was still trying to focus.  You could tell from Bobby's big, puffy face.  Puffy, sleepy face.  No, I'm not gonna watch a river runs through it.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James. 
[00:45:30]  Jimmy James!  He's a regular.  He has to call him Jimmy James.  What's up, man?  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Happy birthday, Danny.  Oh.  Happy birthday, Danny.  Thank you.  Hey, I just wanted to wish Kent a congratulations on his final day of Wedded Bliss.  Yes.  This is the last day before.  Right here?  It's over.  Oh, that's right.  October 1st.  It is over tomorrow. 
[00:46:00]  When does it?  Did you pick up your big, giant check to drop off at our house, like Publishers' Clary?  Yeah.  I really would love to do, like, a giant check thing with some stripping whores to bring  the check out.  You know, something like that.  But, no, I'll keep it civil.  Did you write the check yet?  No, no.  Today?  Yeah.  I'll write it today.  I'll write it today.  Wow.  I'll send it out, and that'll be that.  I gotta put something like, you know, the end in the notes section or something. 
[00:46:30]  You know?  That's funny, actually.  Like, how about just, fiend?  Fiend.  Yeah, like a fucking foreign movie.  F-I-N.  Fiend.  Dunski.  Wow.  That's not bad that you're finally done with your marriage ten years after you decided  it was over with.  Can you believe?  That makes sense.  We live in a society that makes sense, right, guys?  Yeah.  That makes a lot of fucking sense.  I honestly never thought the day would come.  It just seems so fucking long ago, and it was, that me and Opie took that walk to the 
[00:47:00]  bank.  And you had no money in your account.  Which started the whole thing off, the little walk to the fleet bank to take out my money,  which had already been taken out.  That was on the corner of 57th and Broadway.  Yeah, right by Letterman's Theater over there.  And, uh, back then, it just seemed like it was going to be an eternity.  And it turned out to be a very, very long time. 
[00:47:30]  And tomorrow is it.  That is it.  The last of the last.  That's unbelievable.  I know.  Because, I mean, you moved on, obviously, you know.  Oh, yes.  Many times.  But you still technically were connected.  Yeah, yeah.  Without any kids.  Because you're always wondering if she was going to pop up with some nonsense or you  had to write the check that infuriated you.  When lawyers are involved, you always wonder if they're going to, you know, start some other  litigation or something. 
[00:48:00]  So, um, yeah, that was always in the back of my mind.  And with having no kids, no property, nothing, there shouldn't have been this long-term kind  of, eh, relationship that's left over, albeit just purely financial.  But it shouldn't, you know, obviously, in my opinion, it shouldn't have been what it was.  But, uh, that's it.  Tomorrow, it ends. 
[00:48:30]  It's finally fucking over.  It's a celebration.  Yeah, you're going to feel, I don't know, like even freer.  A little weight will be lifted.  You're going to feel even freer.  A little weight will be lifted.  I kind of, uh, I think it's almost like a prison sentence, because we always talk about  that, uh, uh, prison, um, versus the death penalty thing.  Because, you know, people say, well, the rest of his life in prison he's going to have  to suffer, you know what, you get used to things.  Thank you.  So we always said that.  There's no suffering there.  It becomes their life. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  If they're able to see Curb Your Enthusiasm on a Sunday night, and this guy murdered one  of your loved ones, is he really suffering?  Yeah, I'm glad he's suffering.  Does he get a peek at the football games on Sunday?  Of course he does.  Does he get to hear maybe some fucking Molly Hatcher that's cranking out through the prison  somewhere?  I don't know.  Does he never, ever laugh?  Right.  Of course he laughs.  Where's the suffering for real?  It just becomes your life.  When people say, no, I'd rather have him suffer for the rest of his life in prison.  It just becomes, that's your life.  You can't think of it because it's so horrific to think about being locked up in prison. 
[00:49:30]  It's not a treat, I'm sure, but it becomes something.  Like, when they're, even though I hear the food is horrendous, I'm sure every once in  a while there's something in there where this guy that killed your loved one's like,  ooh, pizza.  Ooh, this is tasty.  Yeah.  You don't want the guy that killed your loved one to ever say, ooh, this is tasty.  To have any bit of pleasure.  As he's in the joint.  Right.  Yeah.  To have any bit of pleasure.  And guess what?  You could still whack off.  Yeah, sure.  Is he suffering, really?  You know?  As he's dreaming about all the big-breasted women on the outside and, you know, taking care 
[00:50:00]  of the poison?  You go to, you have a job in most cases.  So, you know, you're working somewhere, you're reading, you have access to books, and you  could get degrees.  I mean, there's a bunch of things people do in prison.  Yeah, I'm sure they would rather be out and about, but I don't really agree.  Maybe not.  Look at poor Brooks.  Right.  He didn't want to be out and about, did he?  Where's the music? 
[00:50:30]  Thank you, Travis.  We're a well-oiled machine at this point, huh?  The world had went and got itself in a big damn hurry.  I saw an automobile once.  Once.  Once.  Fucking old man.  Yeah, you fucking old fogey.  Good.  Go hang yourself, you dummy.  You're a burden.  No one cares about you.  You can't even bag fucking groceries.  Sometimes my hands hurt. 
[00:51:00]  Do they?  What a burden he was.  Just fucking carve your name in a beam and kick the fucking table out with those stupid  old man's shoes.  Commit crimes against society, and then you can't even bag our groceries.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Make yourself a necktie, silly.  I could shoot my boss, maybe like a bonus.  I'll go to the park to see if Jake will come by to visit.  He never does.  Of course he doesn't. 
[00:51:30]  Jake couldn't wait to get fucking rid of you.  That's where a bird wants to live, in a fucking penitentiary.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Brooks.  He's going to come and hang out with you because you gave him a fucking worm once.  You're going to eat that?  Shut up.  Yeah, but you just get used to it, and it becomes part of your life.  And then I was talking, obviously, it's not as bad as prison, but that, the checks that  I had to write just became, like, part of the cost of doing business of my life. 
[00:52:00]  And, you know, it was very annoying to have to write that out every few months, you know?  But, tomorrow, it's over.  That's it.  God, I wish I could fucking talk about it.  Thank God.  Yeah, there you go.  Congrats, Ant.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's good.  Oh, I'm very happy about it.  It's finally upon you.  Yes.  We should take our first break. 
[00:52:30]  Just a little teaser, because is Mike Rowe here?  Oh, Mike's here.  We're going to get him in the studio next.  Now, I saw Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel, and the season premiere is October 6th.  I saw the first episode, and, you know, it's great.  Mike, this show, you start thinking, how the fuck is he going to keep this thing interesting?  How many Dirty Jobs are out there?  And he keeps it going, man.  He really does.  It's all about Mike, too.  He's a very funny guy.  I can't hold back from saying this, and I hope it doesn't mess up the premiere episode.  I'm hoping he talks about this one point a little bit on the show today. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  We learn in the season premiere of Dirty Jobs that, you know, the mattress you lie on at home?  I do.  We all have a mattress, right?  Yes, we do.  How about we play a little game right now before the break?  Oh, no.  Okay.  About seven.  The mattress is...  Okay, you got a mattress at home, right?  Yeah.  How much heavier is it than when you bought it?  No way.  With time going by, obviously.  So you buy a brand new, spanking new... 
[00:53:30]  Posturepedic.  Posturepedic.  It smells good.  It has the...  Simmons beauty, right?  Yes.  Right.  I prefer the Kraftmatic Adjustable Gregory so I can sit up and eat soup.  I like to have a nice lentil before I go to bed.  I like to dip crackers in a nice cool lentil soup before bed.  Perhaps a little tomato juice to wash it down.  My old Kraftmatic... 
[00:54:00]  Sometimes the bed will go on the fritz and I'll fall backwards and get soup all over my chest.  Oh, how we laugh.  I have third degree burns in my body unless it's cool.  That's why I began chilling at first.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  I thought that was a reason for that.  Certainly was.  Third degree burns on my left nipple, Anthony.  Very painful.  Ow.  Now, I assume...  Don't look down for the answer, Ant. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, God.  Please don't look down for the answer.  Steve from Bayshore.  So you got this mattress.  It's brand new.  You start sleeping on it.  The years go by.  I think it was the lifetime of the mattress, obviously, but now it's time for a new one.  How much heavier is your mattress from the first day you brought it home?  From...  Do you want me to tell you from one?  I'm going to guess.  I think I know.  This can only be from skin, parasites, hair, drool, jism, periods, skid marks. 
[00:55:00]  And, of course, if you are having the soup in bed and you spill a couple drops in there,  you spill a couple drops over the years, it's going to add up.  And bed bugs, by the way, too.  Bed bugs.  Which was the parasites, for the most part.  How many more pounds does it weigh?  I just want to mess it up with an awful guess.  Yeah, I know.  You've worked. 
[00:55:30]  I'm going to guess 1,600 pounds heavier, Gregory.  1,600.  Nothing worse than a fucking horrible holding a top guess.  Crumbs, too.  Crumbs.  Yes.  Should we wait?  Why don't we let Mike give the answer?  Dog hair, sweat stains when you get those nice sweats.  Yeah, yeah.  All that's got to be in there.  Yeah.  We should tease it.  You want to tease it?  You want to guess?  Oh, tease the shit out of this.  All right, we'll tell you how much.  People are just chomping at the bit.  How much heavier your mattress is by the end of its lifetime. 
[00:56:00]  And whoever guesses closest gets the kiss Mike square on the lips.  Oh, wow.  Well, we've got to ask Mike if he's okay with that.  He's all for it.  Believe me.  Mike.  I know him.  He's fine.  Yeah.  Oh, he's nodding, I see, in the office.  He's okay with this.  Yeah, he's a good boy.  He's a sick fuck, Mike.  Oh, Steve from Pajor is adding another thing that maybe might be on the bed.  Miscarriages.  There you go.  Thank you, Steve.  Like you just leave him there.  Yeah.  Like you wouldn't blot that up.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:56:30]  Come on.  What's that?  Why is your sheet missing?  Long story.  All right.  Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  Yes.  Next.  Stay there.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike Rowe, huh?  Dirty Jobs.  Gentlemen.  Tuesday, 9 p.m. on the Discovery Channel.  Next Tuesday.  Still on.  Still on.  Still doing it.  Shocking.  We haven't seen you in maybe a year.  And for that, I apologize.  No, no.  It's all right.  No, no.  I really do. 
[00:57:00]  I've been to New York once since then.  He's been busy.  And I tried.  But, you know, I'm just a pawn.  What I was going to say about that, when we saw you last time, which might be about a year,  we told you, like, how many more of these Dirty Jobs shows could you do?  You're running out of Dirty Jobs.  But you know what?  You're not.  It's a crazy thing.  And I'd like to take some credit for it.  But I can't.  I haven't had an original idea since, I don't know, 2004.  And so, you know, at the end of every show, I literally throw myself onto the ground,  sometimes assuming a kneeling posture. 
[00:57:30]  You beg.  I'll even clasp my hands and gaze skyward from time to time in an attempt to invoke,  you know, whatever almighty might be kindly listening.  And so, we have hundreds of thousands of ideas that come in.  I wish they were all, you know, unique and different.  But there's enough in there to keep us broadcasting.  Yeah.  You feel like you have at least a couple more seasons in you, right?  I'm afraid you may be right.  Yeah.  I was telling Mike just before he went on the air that I was re-watching an episode where  the crew, all, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment, ends up 
[00:58:00]  in a swamp that's alligator infested.  And Mike's safely on the shore as the guys are trying to salvage the equipment and see  what will dry out and work again.  And I'm thinking as the dumb viewer at home, like, there's fucking alligators in the water,  Mike.  Why don't you tell your crew to get out of there?  Well, the crew was well aware of the dangers at hand.  But they, you know, it's weird when you shoot a show like this.  I mean, this happened in New York last time, too, when we were doing the water towers up  on top of the skyscrapers.  You put yourself in these situations best described as just stupid. 
[00:58:30]  You know, I mean, you're not tied off.  You're swinging a sledgehammer or you're in an alligator-invested swamp, whatever.  And you suddenly feel like you're bulletproof.  You know, you're making TV, so you're in this bubble.  Yeah, so you're kind of safe.  Yeah, the alligator's not going to bother me.  I mean, clearly, I'm in the union.  Surely you realize.  They don't bite TV stars.  No, no, no.  They know who we are.  Till it becomes the next YouTube sensation.  And Mike Rowe, wow.  Wait till you see this, Clay. 
[00:59:00]  We never thought this would happen.  What a miscalculation.  But he's going to look good with that fake leg.  He'll be all right.  He's all right.  He seems so bright.  Yeah, it does seem like there's just an endless supply of horrible places for them to  send you and your crew.  You know what it is?  I do like when the crew gets something dripped on them.  That is fun.  That is fun.  Not so much just a deluge, but just a little bit of gack from whatever you're doing gets  on your camera guy and you see him kind of wiping himself off. 
[00:59:30]  No, you know what?  A little annoyed.  That's a really interesting point.  Sometimes a touch of gack is more effective than a waterfall of disappointment.  You know, because you can see it there on your garment, you know, quivering as the afternoon  sun catches it.  And it's like, my God, you've been truly soiled in a relatable way.  Yeah.  What is the thing with the mattresses?  Because they tease it before the break.  Well, yeah, we're going to get into that.  And I just wanted to ask Mike really fast.  Before that, though, we always like asking you the worst situation since the last time 
[01:00:00]  we saw you.  Oh, God.  So the worst situation you were in in the last year.  Yeah.  Well, in terms of, you know, the pucker factor and just completely, you know, crapping it  up a little bit, we did a window washing segment.  Wanted to do it here in New York.  And that's when I was hoping to see you next.  But really difficult to get permission to wash the windows on the Chrysler building and  between the unions and between the...  You couldn't get that done?  You're my grow.  I tried.  No go. 
[01:00:30]  So we found a 50-story high rise in Honolulu over Pearl Harbor where they wash windows.  This is the only place in the country that still does it with bosun chairs.  So you basically sit on a two by four.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the girl in the Cadbury swing, you know?  And you crawl off a gantry train on the top of this building, you get your ass in that  little tiny thing, and then with a squeegee and a bucket of studs, you repel down this building  with these four or five Hawaiian studs who just have no fear. 
[01:01:00]  And I mean, it's the first time one of my camera guys actually took a pass.  Said, I'm not going.  Wanted to, just couldn't.  Now, was it a rope or was it a metal chain?  Straight on, you've got a carabiner, you've got your basic, I mean, it's a repelling job.  It's basically mountaineering, except you've got a squeegee and suds and windows in front  of you that are 150, 160 degrees because they're right in the sun.  And it's one of the hardest, most distracting, no bullcrap, Jesus, you've got to be kidding 
[01:01:30]  me jobs ever.  And that'll be coming.  And I just saw the footage because we hired a helicopter for it because I figured if we're  going to put ourselves in that situation, I want it to, I want the best cinematic shots  for it again.  And you were outside the building.  And it looks, oh yeah.  You were sitting on the freaking two by four.  For about three hours.  Holy.  For about three hours.  And one of my camera guys got his hair caught in the device, the DRT, you know, that plays  the rope out.  A guy had to go off the rope, find him, pull out a knife and basically cut his hair off 
[01:02:00]  in order to frame from the line.  He had to go off the rope.  What do you mean?  He came off the roof.  I'm getting nervous.  This is uncomfortable.  It was Troy, my blonde haired mute cameraman who's just pinned to the side of the building  with his hair all just pulled in to this release mechanism.  And so one of the window washers got in the elevator, went back to the top of the building,  repelled down, got Troy, pulled out his knife and cut Troy's hair off.  Every year, window washers who do this in this setup, in these Bosun chairs, get scalped 
[01:02:30]  because their hair gets caught in this device.  That's why they all shave their heads now.  Exit.  So that's coming up and that's going to be good.  So wait, is there a back on this fucking thing you're sitting on?  No.  Like, picture this chair with no back and instead of the nice webbing that your ass is on now,  just an old two by four.  Two pieces of rope coming through holes.  You know, I think the willingness to suffer ultimately engenders a level of pity in the  employer which leads to the ability to charge a higher rate.  Were you scared? 
[01:03:00]  Sure.  I made a high-pitched little girl type sound twice.  How do you get off like, now you're in the chairs behind you, do you put it on your ass  and then just start going down the building?  That is an excellent question and I didn't ask it until I realized that the answer was  not what you just described.  And here's the moment of crisis.  You get on this gantry train which is on the roof, this crane, and it extends.  So you're standing on mesh, all right, and you're looking straight down 500 feet.  The lip of this crane is smooth and round and you lie on it, okay? 
[01:03:30]  Now you're on your belly.  You've already put the swing down and it's dangling maybe three and a half feet below you.  You take your arms and you grab onto this piece of lipping that's over it.  And then, and here's the moment, you throw yourself over, hanging on with your hands.  Now you take your feet and you put it on the swing, this little piece of wood.  Then you grab the rope that holds the swing and then you very slowly get your ass in the swing. 
[01:04:00]  What's the mortality rate?  50%?  It's actually, believe it or not, it's statistically safer than the scaffolding.  After all of the safety and all of the routines that are normally applied, you still have,  you know, all that scaffolding weighs a lot.  How do you hold the bucket onto the thing?  It's tied into one of the holes next to it.  So that dangles.  And your squeegees in the bucket, that dangles too and you wrap it around your wrist so you  don't drop it.  But once you're in and once you get it, it's actually, it's art and science, man. 
[01:04:30]  Because these guys, there's a whole feathering technique you do with the squeegee, you know,  so you don't leave trails.  And they move at something like the speed of light because they're racing the sun, which  is at your back.  So the deal is once you slather up the window, if you don't squeegee it properly the first  time it streaks, so you have to do it again.  There's six of you in a row descending down the face of this crazy building and you go pretty  much as a group, you know, and that's how you work your way down.  How long does it take you to do one side while they die?  It took me about four months. 
[01:05:00]  These guys can do it in about an hour and a half.  That's amazing.  Oh, they're not afraid of heights at all.  They're afraid of widths.  Really?  Heights are no problem.  You've heard the story that happened here in New York, the scaffolding that fell like  50 stories and the guy, you know, survived it.  Yeah, amazing.  Unbelievable.  He has one, his brother was impaled.  Oh yeah, his brother.  The fence didn't make it, obviously, but the one dude did.  No, I mean, to this day, when people talk about height type stories and, you know, all  of this stuff, it's always back to New York with those water towers. 
[01:05:30]  That's the segment.  We got more mail on that.  What was the water tower?  I didn't see that one, Mike.  You know those big water towers on top of the building?  Yeah, you said those big wooden water towers.  What's the job there?  Well, you don't see these things until you look for them.  And once you look for them, you see them everywhere.  But the job is they're all 100 years old and they're made of wood.  And any building in Manhattan over six stories gets their water from these gravity fed towers  that are on top of the building.  And eventually the wood rots.  So to replace them, they take all of the wood up to build a new one. 
[01:06:00]  They turn the water off for a day.  And then they build this thing literally in midair, piece by piece.  So they're carpenters that are also acrobats.  And they're up there swinging their sledgehammers and drilling their stuff at the speed of light.  And I'm telling you, it is amazing.  At the end of the day, there's a tower where there wasn't.  And if there's not, there's no water in the building.  And the health department comes out and somebody gets fired.  So what do they put between the water and the actual wood?  What do they coat the wood with or keep it just from rotting immediately? 
[01:06:30]  It's treated probably with the same crap you put on your deck, something like that.  And then there's a standpipe under the tower itself that feeds into a main.  And it's from that.  You know, any building less than six stories doesn't have, you know, enough gravity to allow you to pump it up.  So you have to put it on top.  Right.  So all the buildings have them.  But it's really beautiful.  Next time you're up on the roof, you know, you really check out the skyline.  You'll see these things everywhere.  How long do they last before they have to be replaced?  And one more question.  Why don't they put metal, make them out of metal? 
[01:07:00]  Because they don't make them out of metal because, believe it or not, the wood actually lasts longer if it's treated properly.  You know, there's no rust.  There's no, you know, you don't have to treat it.  You see some of those things are ancient.  They're ancient.  Yeah.  And there are only two companies, really, in the whole city that deal with them.  The one I went with was Rosenwalk, I think.  They build them all from scratch.  You know, they put them up.  They take them down.  It's an amazing team.  What was your job that day?  Not die.  Not to fall over the side.  Yeah.  You know, it's the same job as all the time. 
[01:07:30]  You know, people become familiar with the show, so they know to kind of look out for me.  But I'm, you know, for me, it's the first day of work every single day.  It's Groundhog Day in a sewer.  I got to ask you about New Orleans.  Yeah.  Get serious for a moment.  I mean, what was that like?  Because you did a few dirty jobs down there going into these old houses.  Yeah, it was interesting for me.  Doing some demolition and whatnot.  Well, about a month and a half after Katrina happened.  A lot of people started to call and say, you know, look, we should go down there and do this.  And I was personally just very hesitant.  I didn't think that, you know, we needed to see another fake journalist standing probably in the rubble, you know, saying, you know, I'm here to help you. 
[01:08:00]  I mean, come on, just bull crap.  They all went away very quickly when it wasn't a story anymore.  Exactly.  So a year and a half after it happened, we went down.  And it was amazing because at that point, there was a huge lull in the press.  And it really looked like Beirut.  I mean, there was just nothing going on.  And I hooked up with a group of guys from Ohio who had come down and had been volunteering for months.  And we got it a house, you know, and then we got it another one. 
[01:08:30]  And then I went home because that was the end of that day.  And I said, what's the plan?  And they're like, we'll be here for a year or so.  They're probably still down there.  Really?  You know what?  I mean, deep down, I'm somewhere between a realist and a pessimist.  But honestly, you go to a place like that and you see these guys coming in from all over just because, you know, because they want to.  And, you know, good on them.  There's some decent souls out there, actually.  Will they ever clean that?  No.  They won't, right?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  I mean, look, it'll get cleaner, you know, and I suppose sooner or later all things can come back. 
[01:09:00]  But there's going to just be hundreds and hundreds of houses that they never touch again.  The problem is when you start to look at percentages of people coming back, you start to feel pretty good when you see it go from 5 to 10 to 20.  And then it kind of bottoms out around 25.  The reality is that's not enough to turn the grid back on.  You know, you can't have 50% people, you know, leave L.A., for instance, and then come back and have everything be cool.  It just doesn't work.  You know, you need to come back for real to justify all those city services. 
[01:09:30]  And they can't even have the towers built, and that's what the entire city wants.  It's like people don't give as much shit about New Orleans as they do about New York.  It's just a reality.  And if you can't get it done in fucking ground zero, they're not going to get it done in New Orleans anytime soon.  So you could just wander around.  It's like a ghost town now in certain sections?  Well, I mean, that was not a year and a half ago.  I mean, the show keeps hearing.  I haven't been down there in nearly two years, so I can't speak to it directly.  But I can tell you that walking through, I mean, it's not like, geez, what happened to that house or that house? 
[01:10:00]  It's like that block, it's a do-over.  And then 40 blocks like it.  Wow.  And you're just like, what in the heck?  I chartered a helicopter when I was there when we were done shooting just because I really wanted to fly over and see it.  And, I mean, it's just going to stop your heart, man.  I mean, it's unfathomable until you get it from that angle.  So, amazing.  One question I had, when you bit the balls off the sheep, I mean, I love that one.  We keep them around for the segues.  Yeah.  No kidding. 
[01:10:30]  I love animals.  I kind of felt so bad for the animals.  Why do they do it like that?  Can't they do it nicer?  Fabulous question.  The short answer is no.  And this, when I knew that that story was going to happen, I called PETA, and I wanted to understand what the right way to do it was.  And they described in detail what I should expect if it were done properly.  It involved rubber bands placed over the scrotum of the animal.  The rubber bands constrict the flow of blood, and a couple of days later, the testicles fall off. 
[01:11:00]  Okay?  So, I'm like, all right, that sounds horrible, but at least it's something we can put on TV.  Well, we show up there, and, you know, I get on a horse.  We get the sheep all together.  The farmer comes over.  I'm like, okay, we ready to go?  He says, we're ready.  His wife, Melanie, picks the sheep up, puts it on the post, spreads its legs.  Albert leans in, reaches in his pocket, and I expect him to pull out one of these rubber bands.  Guy pulls out a knife, cuts off the end of the scrotum, and within a second exposes the testicles, which look like these little pink thumbs coming out of nowhere. 
[01:11:30]  And then, before I can even get my head around what I'm seeing, he bends down and bites them off and spits them into a bucket that I've been holding.  And they make a sound like when they hit, you know?  And it was that sound.  It was like hitting the bottom of the bucket.  So, I stop, and I say, look, man, cut.  I mean, I never say cut.  Dirty jobs, just take one.  But I'm just like, cut.  I'm like, look, you can't do this, you know?  And he's like, what are you talking about?  This is how we do it.  And I said, come on.  And, you know, I figure he's just trying to do something outrageous to me on TV. 
[01:12:00]  So, he goes, you want to do the rubber bands?  We'll do the rubber bands.  And he demonstrates.  Well, here's the thing.  This sheep takes about five steps, falls down, gets up, staggers around, falls down again.  Now, Jimmy, if you're an animal, this would break your heart.  It crawls off in a corner, sits down, and just starts to shake.  And I say, Jesus, how long?  How long does this go on?  Three days.  Three days before his balls fall off, right?  Meanwhile, the one he had just orally removed, right? 
[01:12:30]  It's just walking around, you know, no bleeding.  Bleeding stopped.  Nursing, you know, like it never happened.  Point is, there's so much that goes on in the world that just makes you think, this can't possibly be kosher.  And yet, had I followed the guidelines, I mean, right in front of me, I'm looking at an animal that had been tended to properly, that's in abject misery, next to one.  I can still see the blood on Albert's chin from its scrotum. 
[01:13:00]  And he's happy as can be.  Not Albert the sheep.  Why isn't there a tool?  Yeah, man.  Besides the man's mouth, that could be used.  Efficiency.  When you're a sheep herder, it's you sometimes and one other person.  When you're castrating, as you have to do, I mean, it's a huge part of the job, you got two hands.  Somebody holds the sheep, you make the cut, you need both hands to keep the scrotum pushed all the way up into the belly.  There's no extra hand to facilitate any extra tool. 
[01:13:30]  What you need is an extra body, and that costs money.  Well, you know something, well worth the price, hiring another guy, if it comes down to having to use your mouth like that.  And how do they stop the bleeding?  Wow.  There's no need.  It just stops.  It stops in about a minute.  Hey, before we start talking about some more of the new season of Dirty Jobs starting next Tuesday, Discovery Channel 9 o'clock.  Is there a job you wanted to do, and other jobs you wanted to do, and you just couldn't get it done? 
[01:14:00]  Because I would think, you know, no matter what you want to do, they would just allow you to do that.  You know what I mean?  No, I hear no.  Like you said, like the window washers in New York City couldn't get that done.  Couldn't get it done.  Is there other ones?  Sure, sure.  Like one you really wanted to do?  Oh, well, look, I mean, there's some jobs that I couldn't get on the air, not because it's fundamentally a celebration, the show.  And I mean, I don't mind making you throw up.  I mean, I hope to gross you out a little bit, because once you do that, you get people's attention, and then you can, you know, say whatever you want. 
[01:14:30]  But, you know, there's some shows that are just too gross, and there's some shows that will just leave you so dispirited and broken afterwards.  I just don't want to air them.  You know, crime scene cleanup, fascinating job.  You know, embalming.  Body farm.  Amazing jobs.  A little depressing.  You check out any of that stuff?  Depress a hyena, absolutely.  In fact, I did it.  Not for jobs, for the show I was working on right before it, and I wanted to go back and do it for this.  But the truth is, you know what? 
[01:15:00]  Leave it to America undercover or Showtime or something else.  The body farm thing is, I read about that.  Oh, my God.  In the book, Stiff.  They just lay out these bodies in these fields and do all sorts of experiments on them.  You put a body in the trunk of a pinto, take the pinto, drive it into the marsh, submerge it, leave it there for two weeks, come back, pull it out, open the trunk, and now you know what a body looks like that's been in a marsh in Florida for two weeks.  And you do all kinds of tests on it. 
[01:15:30]  It's fascinating, and it is important.  But in the end, God, it's just depressing hyena, you know, it's no good.  That is really bad, man.  And you checked out embalming?  We checked it out, but ultimately, you know, dead bodies on TV, it's a whole nother, I mean, just forget it.  Well, just go far away, and then we can handle it.  Hard to make your funny little quips when there's just a dead body on a table.  There's nothing to shut a smartass up like a dead body.  Yeah.  He's starting speculating in humorous fashion on how they died. 
[01:16:00]  With a headless kind of caved it.  Cut.  Mike.  No good.  Mike.  Look, I'm trying here.  Yeah.  The victim.  I'm working with what I am.  Because that's a big part of the show is Mike.  I mean, you know, anybody can go in and do some of these jobs and stuff, but Mike makes it fun and entertaining with your little quips.  Your sarcasm is hysterical.  I love when the people don't pick up on it.  That makes it even more funny.  They think you're asking a serious question when obviously you are being so horribly sarcastic. 
[01:16:30]  See, the thing is, and I've said this to you guys before, and I know you know it.  There are days here when you're doing your thing.  And, you know, I know you're devoted and loyal to your audience, but whatever.  When it comes down to it, if you're not amusing yourself, your audience doesn't really care.  You know, you just become two guys trying to amuse a few million people, and that's kind of, you know, okay, I get it.  That's sort of tragic.  You know, much more interesting to me anyway.  When I listen to you guys, when I watch TV that I like, you know, to see people who are mainly just trying to keep themselves conscious and amused. 
[01:17:00]  And that's really all Jobs is from my point of view.  I'm just trying to get, I'm a fish out of water every day.  I'm just trying to get through it.  Yeah.  We've got to talk about the mattress.  People are killing me here.  Yeah.  Sure.  So we saw the season premiere, or I saw the season premiere last night, and you were talking about the mattress thing.  Yeah.  We've got to give away the answer.  Well, sure.  You buy a brand.  Well, go ahead.  Because I don't know what I want to, I don't know, I don't want to wreck your premiere.  Look, there is no answer, and I'm not even sure what the question is, because there's not much new to say about the fact that we all get our eight hours. 
[01:17:30]  You know, we spend a third of our life unconscious and horizontal, you know, sleeping, for the most part, on one of four mattresses.  Most people will never own more than four mattresses in their adult life.  And, you know, I heard you guys mention it before, but it's a fact.  You know, you buy a mattress that weighs 60 pounds, you use it for 10 years, you know, the thing weighs 75 pounds.  Oh. 
[01:18:00]  Figure it out.  Yeah.  How'd that happen?  15 pounds of, where did that come from, of all sorts of stuff.  Yeah.  Dead skin, bugs.  It's mainly dead skin.  Bodily.  Where does it get stored?  In the actual material, or like under, by the springs?  If you rip the mattress open, will you just see dead skin?  Well, if you rip it open, as you'll see in the show, there's a special place in San Francisco where they put it on this device, like a torture rack, and you just start ripping the tops off.  Well, it's just a, it looks like the air is full of dust. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, crap.  It's not dust.  It's all skin and, and look, I'll tell you something else that's just damn disturbing, but most dust, like if you're sitting in your house and you see a shaft of light come through the window, and you know how it like lights up, and you're like, geez, I had no idea my apartment was so damn dusty.  That's just your skin floating around.  What do you think dust is, you know?  I mean, it's, so, yeah, a mattress that gains 10% of its weight is, I mean, it's just a horrible thing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, that's, that, 15 pounds.  I wonder how much the mattress of one of those people, uh, we should, we should, yeah, I know.  We have to, uh, share, you, you have time, right?  I got, sure, I got time.  Okay.  Yeah.  Is she here?  Yes.  So we have to bring her in.  Yeah, all right.  We got Victoria Gotti here.  Oh, but listen, I don't want to make any trouble.  Yeah, so we're going to split the time.  She's only here till 8 o'clock.  Yeah, then we'll go back to Mike.  Is that cool, Mike?  Of course.  Yeah.  All right.  She has a book, uh.  No, hang in here, Mike.  Help us out with this one. 
[01:19:30]  Are they bringing her in?  What are they doing?  Yeah, but we're, uh, we're getting her right now.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, bring her in, of course.  All right, so, uh, Mike Rowe, Dirty Jobs, Tuesday, 9 o'clock on the Discovery Channel.  We're going to talk to Mike.  Well, you're going to help us out here, Mike.  Just hang in here.  I'm staying until they come and get me.  You're no broadcaster.  It's not just about the filth, either.  It's also the, um, the situations you get yourself put in.  Like, you know, the altitudes.  Sure.  And then those claustrophobic spots.  Oh, man.  Really tight spaces, too, is coming. 
[01:20:00]  Fuck that.  That's, I'm out.  Honestly.  No way.  The one with the locks or whatever that was.  Oh, Sue locks, man.  You crawled down into this, it was like a metal coffin.  You know that scene from, you remember The Ring, that movie?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The scene from the person in the bottom of the well, and when they look up, and the sky,  just, all you do is you see it through that, through the top of the well.  Yeah.  That happened, we were cleaning caves in California, you know, abandoned mine shafts. 
[01:20:30]  They're everywhere.  People die every year.  They fall into these things.  And I got caught in the bottom of one of those.  And looking up, you know, you just see the clouds, you know, slowly moving over this  little tiny patch of blue.  And then it's dark.  And then it's bad, man.  Do you realize how deep down there you are?  And it's just, I mean, every year, there were 47,000 of these things abandoned during  the gold rush.  And there's still tens of thousands of them, you know, under brush and things.  Animals fall in.  People fall in. 
[01:21:00]  Hunters fall in.  And that's where they die.  That's it.  Yeah.  You're done.  Amazing.  Yeah.  It's bad.  We can continue with Mike in a second.  But we got Victoria Gotti.  Yeah, she is.  Entering the studio.  Hello.  Hi.  Hello.  Take a little seat over there.  Very nice.  Ooh, yes.  I know.  I want a copy.  Now, the book.  Jimmy's been reading the book like crazy the last day or so, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  We got copies of it last night.  And it's just been, the post has been had like little features every day, as you know. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  And it's really, it's like you're a family that people want to learn about.  Usually people read about a family and they're like, ugh.  But you're really talking about everything that kind of happened with your family in this.  Yeah.  Have you talked about it before publicly or has it always been kind of people knew, but?  No.  I guess we just, you know, people assume, people ask the most insane questions.  Sometimes rudely so when I was out promoting a book, a novel, doing a show, something like that.  But no, never talked about it. 
[01:22:00]  What's the biggest, I mean, you know, you hear the name Gotti and of course everybody thinks you're your father.  Right.  What's the biggest misconception people have about what your father was or what your life is like as his daughter?  That I was some mafia princess.  That probably bothers me a lot next to the stigma that goes along with just being Gotti.  I think that bothers me the most is that, you know, we grew up in this, you know, mansion a la the Godfather and rode around in, you know, bulletproof cars.  And, you know, I grew up dirt poor, you know, we were in probably the poorest part of Brooklyn and there was nothing glamorous or glorious about my upbringing. 
[01:22:30]  And I think that's the biggest misconception, I believe.  How old were you when you were, because I was reading, again, I couldn't really enjoy the books.  I was just kind of going through looking for points.  And it was, everything you read, you want to just keep going on it.  It was, talked about when your dad went to jail when you were really, when did you realize what your dad did or that, like, he's not like other fathers.  This is not the way most dads make their living. 
[01:23:00]  Believe it or not, I say in the book that I find out for the first time that dad was in prison.  Instead of away working, which is what he often told, always told us, I was seven years old.  I go to school.  I do a book report.  Who's your hero?  As most of the kids did, I said dad.  And I go on to say how, why, what he does for a living.  And one of the kids in the back of the room obviously heard from their parents at dinner table.  Who knows?  But she yelled out, you know, her dad's not a construction worker. 
[01:23:30]  He doesn't build tall buildings.  He's in jail.  And I remembered just being so blown away that day at seven.  I literally peed my pants in school, in the classroom.  It was like one big blur.  And I think I looked at the teacher to help me.  You know, it's like you look for an adult, anybody that's going to direct this situation or redirect.  And she, I'll never forget when she handed me a mop and said, you know, not only can you not leave the room to pull yourself, she handed me that mop and said, clean it up. 
[01:24:00]  And that was like the further embarrassment.  So I think by the time I got home that day, I was so angry at mom, at dad, at, you know, at seven years old.  I felt so betrayed, so had, you know.  And I was young enough, though, but still not that young to know that I was had.  I was angry.  Did your mom tell you, like, when was the first time you heard the name, like, the word mafia?  When was the first time that came into your life where you just heard that talked about?  Believe it or not, people ask me, well, when did you really put this all together? 
[01:24:30]  When did you really figure out?  And for me, my mom, my sister, it wasn't until the late 80s.  The late 80s when, exactly, mom called me up one day.  We had a three-way conversation between mom, myself, my sister.  And mom made a comment, something to the effect of, can you believe the tabloid reports now?  Did you see today's paper?  The headline is, and we were like, what?  What was it?  And she said, today they have your father as being now the boss of all bosses. 
[01:25:00]  That, I guess, even to mom was so, you know, fictitious, so over the top.  And I remember we all kind of went, oh, my God, you have to be kidding me.  After that, you know, with each report, each headline, each story, you start putting the pieces together.  And I think now that we've discussed it sometime later, we all kind of agreed that silently we put the pieces together and figured this is what it is.  It is what it is.  It wasn't such a fallacy.  Even though you figured it out, had it gotten to the point where you were like, oh, my God, you know, he's had people killed. 
[01:25:30]  Now, when that revelation came into your head, how did that make you feel, knowing that people were being murdered?  The interesting thing is, Dad, never, ever, ever.  And that's why a lot of people say, well, how couldn't you tell?  Or why didn't you see?  Dad made sure those two worlds were separate.  He never, ever crossed that line.  He didn't take any of that mob speak home. 
[01:26:00]  You weren't allowed to bring up even shows like The Sopranos.  You couldn't owe up to even having seen it, talked about it.  That was his angst.  That was his, you know, you just could not.  You couldn't talk about men's business.  Women belonged in the kitchen, taking care of the kids.  The men were, you know, the men.  At dinnertime, we were asked to leave the table.  The women, as far back as, I think, when I was even 20, in my early, you had to leave the room.  It wasn't, it was a time now for women to get up, excuse themselves, go on. 
[01:26:30]  And the men would have their conversations.  But Dad would never, ever.  For instance, Gravano.  People had said to me, well, did you know Gravano well?  Hardly knew him at all.  Dad never allowed.  But I can honestly say, and I think Gravano owed up to that in his memoir, that he had never been inside my home, my family home.  Dad would never, ever bring any of these men home.  He would never introduce us to these men.  He never made those two worlds cross.  He would never allow it to.  So I guess he did a good job of keeping us far removed from that. 
[01:27:00]  You know, it was just two separate worlds.  But in time, even though he was keeping, you know, trying to shelter you guys from his life, it had to creep in through the media and stuff.  And again, you know, knowing about the killings.  I mean, that, because that's the ultimate.  If you have a dad that's, you know, all right, he's robbing this or, you know, but, I mean, responsible for the death of people.  How did that strike you? 
[01:27:30]  You know, at that point, too, I mean, I say it in the book, too.  I love the man, but I loathe the life.  I don't understand why he made choices that he made.  I can't answer that for him.  I can say that for me, it was a horrible feeling.  It was, if I could have anything in the world, it would have been to have a nine-to-five dad that, you know, was an architect, was an attorney, was something other than what he was, what he chose.  But at the very end of the book, like, people say to me, well, did you ever confront him? 
[01:28:00]  Did you ever talk to him?  No.  Again, we never brought these things up.  You just weren't allowed.  You knew your place.  But at the very end of his life, I do have a conversation with him.  And at one point, I say something to him like, you know, I ask him, and he knows what I mean.  And he was kind of, you know, in what they call a medically induced coma.  But he still had his wits about him, which I thought was remarkable, because at that point, he should not have.  And he turns to me.  I said something to him like, what was it all about?  You know, was it worth it?  Meaning, for him, was this path that you chose worth it? 
[01:28:30]  The destruction, the aftermath, you know, the way you died.  And he just kind of, like, leaned over, looked at me, and just, he had this blackboard, which he would scribble on with chalk, and he had no more use of his voice.  And he wrote this thing that went wrong.  And I remember reading it, and I thought, oh, my God.  It said, basically, my life dictated that I choose the path that I took, and blah, blah, blah, blah.  In other words, he felt that this was his path that should never be confused. 
[01:29:00]  There was no excuses for today.  Like, for instance, for anybody else that decided they wanted to be in that life or would welcome that life, that would be the last thing he would advise you to do.  That would be the last thing he'd want you to do.  His attitude was, if you have a way, you have a shot, God, you know, God, take it.  Take it.  This is not something that he would ever say to somebody, yeah, you know what?  Follow me into this.  Or, yeah, you know what?  Go do it. 
[01:29:30]  And your dad, too, was very, very, he was like a rock star, really.  I mean, it was a charismatic thing.  I remember him as a kid watching him on TV.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you didn't think, I want this guy to go to jail.  No.  It's like, wow, that guy is something to be admired.  Well, because he was in the neighborhood Robin Hood.  You know, the thing with dad was, dad, the funny thing about dad, like, a lot of people say to me, well, why do you think the whole, you know, lore of it?  Or, why do you think, or the last man say, well, why didn't you run away from it?  Why didn't you, well, first of all, I love the guy.  You know, I wish I could say I didn't.  I wish I could say I've written a daddy dearest. 
[01:30:00]  I didn't.  It's not about that.  He loved me so much.  I loved him.  But at the end of the day, these people came out at his funeral.  They were lining the streets.  They were crying.  They were holding signs.  These were strangers.  I mean, tens of thousands.  These people believed my father to be this Robin Hood.  He never could say no to anybody, nor did he want to.  You came to him with a song and it didn't.  That was a big joke, even with mom.  Mom would constantly kind of chide him over that.  And sometimes in an angry fashion, she'd say, charity begins at home. 
[01:30:30]  But yet, you go to dad with a song and a dance, boom, you had it.  It didn't matter what you asked for.  It could be the insane.  It could be something for purely materialistic purposes.  You had it.  He just couldn't say no to anybody.  And he thought everybody, especially the underdog, was always celebrated.  Something I read, too, that was amazing is it was very, you know, in 1980, your brother was killed by a neighborhood guy driving.  And the tale in your book is a lot different than what I had heard.  Very different.  Yeah, because there was, you said that he was drunk. 
[01:31:00]  Obviously, I never heard that he was drunk.  You wouldn't.  Well, now you wouldn't.  Because don't forget, back in those days, you're talking about 1980.  There were no, you know, breathalyzers at the scene.  It was not vehicular manslaughter.  It was considered an accident, an unfortunate one at that.  But that's what it was.  At the time, the local cops, the NYPD, they just, when they found out it was John Gotti's son.  You know, that is even before.  You're talking about 1980.  It wasn't where it was in the papers and all. 
[01:31:30]  But that is at a time where even the cops, they would hear things within, you know, internally.  They realized what had happened.  And all they wanted to do immediately was contain the situation.  Get whoever was involved out of there immediately.  They felt it was the safest bet.  They felt, given the tragic circumstances, let's just defuse this.  So when he complained of chest pains, the neighbor, they took him, his wife, I think, took him away and said,  I'll take him to a hospital.  He doesn't need an ambulance.  They took him away.  My brother was taken away with mom. 
[01:32:00]  Dad had not yet arrived.  Went straight to the hospital.  When all of this came to a head, I remember Dad coming home.  And I was, what, 16.  So angry.  So distraught.  And I remember Dad looking at me and saying something to the effect of, you know, it was an accident.  It was a god-awful accident.  And for the first time in my life, I just remember thinking, you're supposed to be the tough guy of this neighborhood.  You're supposed to be the strong.  How dare you?  I was so angry at him because I so loved this little boy that it didn't make sense. 
[01:32:30]  It didn't make sense that he was willing to accept that and leave it at that.  Now, you said this guy in the book, too.  I didn't know this.  The guy was obviously a problem in the neighborhood.  He was not a nice neighbor.  No.  He was a loud drunk.  He was kind of an asshole.  It wasn't like a decent guy that everybody liked.  Did that kind of go into part of why you were saying to your father, are you just going to let this happen?  I was a kid.  I knew his son very well.  See, it was so ironic because our yards touched.  Our backyards were literally, you opened my door and you saw his yard. 
[01:33:00]  But I was very good friends with his son.  In fact, I think I even dated him, you know, all of at 12, you know, held hands, walked down the corner.  But he was a good kid.  He was a good kid.  And I always remember feeling sorry for him because he had it so tough at home.  His dad was a very kind of, you know, by-the-book general type.  And he was constantly getting hit.  He was constantly getting punished.  He was constantly getting berated in front of us, which I felt that was, you know, something my dad, strict as he was, would never do.  Come to the park.  Yell at all of us in front of, you know. 
[01:33:30]  This was something that this man did.  So we kind of hated him.  He was like the big bad wolf of the neighborhood.  But when this had happened and then the neighbors come, and I don't know why, it served no purpose, I think, if anything, it made the situation so much worse, came running to each of us, namely myself, dad, whomever, to say, and can you believe the indignant attitude on this, you know, blank, you know, hole and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, to say after, you know, he didn't even know he had your son under that car.  He dragged him over 200 and something feet. 
[01:34:00]  And he was 12, by the way.  He was riding a minibike and a car hit him while he was riding his minibike.  And supposedly one neighbor had a bang on the car, and the other one reached in and grabbed the keys and said, hey, you know, asshole, he said, you know, do you understand you have a kid under the wheels of your car?  And this guy, you know, gets out.  He's kind of, they said, kind of like dazed and confused and says something like, well, where the hell did he come from and who the F's kid is this?  He was looking around to blame some parent for having this kid in the street.  And he was screaming at the top of his lungs.  What the F was he doing in the street?  Damn, you know, it put him out. 
[01:34:30]  It put him out that he had to hit this boy on this day because he jumped in front of his car.  And that, I think, is what really killed me at the time.  I just felt no remorse.  Two days later, a big celebration at his house.  Big party for the wife.  You know, God knows if that were me and it were a kid, you know, an innocent 12-year-old kid, I don't know how I could live with myself.  Yeah, maybe you lay low and, you know.  You cancel the party.  Go away a little bit.  The party at the very least.  The party at the very least, you know, when I have to walk outside and see a guy swigging back beers with a bunch of guys and, you know, birthday cakes and music coming out. 
[01:35:00]  My mother's upstairs, medicated beyond belief, you know, having just tried to commit suicide twice the night before.  It's kind of difficult, you know.  I'm sorry.  And he did, for people that aren't familiar with the story, he did wind up disappearing.  So everybody knows that he was obviously, he was killed.  And there's a very chilling line I read in your book.  His name was Favara.  Is that how you pronounce it?  Favara.  Favara.  I only wish Favara had shown some remorse, some respect.  I believe he'd be alive today if he had.  I believe that.  And now there was a story I heard many years ago that he had, and this is probably false, that he had come to your house with flowers to apologize. 
[01:35:30]  And your mother had chased him with a bat.  Not true.  But your story is much different.  Much different.  And my story is the truth.  Yeah.  My story is the whole truth, nothing but the truth, God awful truth.  It's even, I believe there's a police report.  There's a file.  Because mom was so erratic in those days, it wasn't the first time she walked around that corner.  It wasn't the first time that night with a party.  The one thing I had hoped wouldn't happen, that hopefully she was so medicated.  She wasn't.  She heard the music. 
[01:36:00]  She came down.  That was the night she walked.  She strolled around the corner, nightgown.  I don't even think she had a wits about her.  I don't think she realized, you know, it was in March, cold.  She goes out in a nightgown, you know, and she takes whatever she can find at the door,  which is a baseball bat.  And she goes to the house with the intention of, she sees the car.  She sees the bloodstains still on the car.  It starts to kind of, you know, freak her out.  And she just starts to hit the car. 
[01:36:30]  You know, he comes out and he's screaming at her again, obnoxiously so.  And I had just been coming up to get her.  I was maybe seconds behind her and he didn't see me at first.  And he's yelling and he's going, you crazy woman, get the F out of here.  That's my car.  Who's going to pay for my F in car?  And when he did finally see me, he looked at me and I thought, well, he's going to cut  it now.  He's going to play like, you know, he was.  And he just turns to me and says, who's going to pay for this F in car?  And I just stared back at him with this glare because again, I'm 15. 
[01:37:00]  What am I going to do?  I grab her arm.  Um, she goes to take, he comes closer now to us to, to yell at me into my face.  And she takes the bat and she literally swings at him.  She barely misses him.  I think she clipped a part of his elbow.  Of course he made it out to be, you know, he had to go to the hospital and he told reporters  that he was rushed to the hospital.  There's no hospital report.  He never went to the hospital.  He wasn't hit.  It was just what it was.  It was an unfortunate situation.  And again, I'm not saying that, you know, uh, anybody's right here. 
[01:37:30]  I'm not doing that.  I'm not saying that the disappearance of this man was a good thing that happened.  I'm just saying at 16, 15, the mindset that I was in, you don't know better.  This is what I want.  I loved this boy.  I was his second mother.  I, I probably wanted revenge like my mother did.  You know, we just, you just want the person.  That's just it.  Wanting the revenge and being that, that age and everything.  Did you later on ever find out what happened?  Did you, I felt guilty for many years. 
[01:38:00]  Did you want to know the details of what happened to this, uh, guy?  I didn't have to, I didn't have to because the neighborhood was so close knit and so small  that everybody was talking about it for many, many years to come.  And I remember hearing all of these different theories.  And then I remember probably it was maybe about six or seven years later hearing the  version that I believe to be the truth.  And I, and I, in fact, I know it, it's, it has to be the truth.  It's the only version that made sense was that at that time, this person that had told 
[01:38:30]  me said, Oh, well, you didn't know, you know, and it was kind of like the town crier who told  everybody's business.  And this person had said to me, you know, that was to score points with dad, you know,  that, that this, this guy that, that knew your father, blah, blah, blah, wouldn't give  a name, but said basically that he had done this because people couldn't believe the lack  of action or reaction on dad's part.  They just didn't get that dad really believed this to be an accident.  And I think that even in his, in his heart and his head, if he had to admit to anybody, 
[01:39:00]  myself, my mother, that he didn't believe it was an accident or that he did believe there  was some misdoing, all the stories that he heard about the man, the parties, the, the,  the drinking, I think then he realized he would have been forced to do something that  would not have made the situation any easier, probably worse.  So I think that he kind of walked around with that mindset deliberately, but I had to sit  there one day and it was like the day of reckoning when I said, all right, which one 
[01:39:30]  is it?  And I had to say, you have to face facts, Vic.  It may have very well been something your father did.  And would I have done the same thing if I were in that position?  I think about my oldest child.  I think about the way I feel about him.  Is there anything I wouldn't have done, uh, for revenge or to retaliate?  And then I sit there and say, okay, but one thing that gets me is all of these guys like  Gravano, the closest guys to dad.  Um, thank you.  Uh, well, none of them had an accurate theory. 
[01:40:00]  None of them.  Every one of them said, I'll show you where the body is to the FBI.  I'll take you there.  They've dug up so many sites that were supposedly, uh, mob graveyards.  One particular site was a few years ago.  It was maybe the sixth theory, the sixth witness that said, we know what happened.  This is what happened.  Oh, I was there or I was responsible or taking credit for this to exchange their sentences.  And again, nothing was found.  It was a total bust for the FBI.  Now there's a recent report, maybe four or five months ago, yet another guy comes forward 
[01:40:30]  and says, this is the real version and this is the God's honest truth.  I heard this in a bar.  I was told by the person that claimed to have taken responsibility.  Well, you had an FBI agent come forward, Coffey, who everybody's familiar with.  Um, and he says to the news, absolute, this one by far is the most ludicrous of all the  theories.  Jamaica Bay, this, that.  Absolutely not.  He said.  And he also did say, I'm not saying that I believe God, he had nothing to do with this.  I'm just saying this one theory, this latest is by far the most preposterous. 
[01:41:00]  Well, your mom and dad were in Florida when, when he, I know she was having a really tough  time.  So he took her to Florida.  And I didn't know what to do with her at that point.  She, she cracked up and he did not know how to handle her at all.  He, he just, he would leave in the mornings.  He would go sit in front of this grave site for my brother for hours at a time during the  day that his men were concerned.  Uh, we were concerned.  He would just sit there deep in thought as if, you know, he wouldn't speak, he wouldn't  do anything.  He would just sit there and hours would go by every single day. 
[01:41:30]  And then it was almost like at night he dreaded coming home because he had to deal with this  woman who was at this point catatonic and he didn't know what to do.  So I of course became somewhat wife, mother, uh, housekeeper, cook, you know, laundress.  And I was going to college.  I, you know, it was a big, it, it just destroyed the entire family.  Family as we knew it never existed beyond that point.  It was, it was gone.  And your dad, it's funny too, because he's so, it's such an associated figure with that  life. 
[01:42:00]  And it's like he wasn't in that position for as long as a lot of other guys were.  And there was this misconception, which I learned from reading that, that he loved the  spotlight and that he craved it.  And he was a Teflon Don.  And, and then you said that, uh, a couple of things that he was very shy and wouldn't  even dance with you at your sweet 16 party.  Would not, would not, would not.  And if you knew him, I mean, for instance, if someone were to take his picture, you saw  him immediately blush.  You saw him turn away.  But people, I think took it the other way because that was always so polite, always smiled, was 
[01:42:30]  always so gracious, tried the best he could to, you know, I mean, one guy in particular  was following him incessantly every day, day in it was, there wasn't a day dad couldn't  open the door, the front door.  And there he was a reporter, a reporter, uh, John Miller actually.  And finally, you know, dad just turns to him in a very nice way and says, John, you know,  you better behave, you better behave.  Now anybody else would have taken that as a threat and said, well, so at the end of the  day, some people had come to me years later with a really good theory and said, you know,  you got this guy Sliwa and he's over there trashing everybody and anybody with your family 
[01:43:00]  and taking credit for this, this and attributing this to your father.  He says, and like, this was his best friend, Sliwa's best friend.  And he says, and you know, by the way, he testified to this as well.  And he says, you know, and we often said to him, hey, you got a guy like John Miller that  if anybody really irked Gotti in the early days, it was John Miller.  It was John Miller that would show up at the social clubs that would record everybody going  in and out that would, you know, really upset Gotti enough that this is not good to get 
[01:43:30]  this kind of attention on this man or on this place.  And he did.  And this guy turned around and said, and he's still walking around, John Miller.  Nothing ever happened to him.  Nothing ever, you know, came of it.  And in the end, there was a certain camaraderie, respect that dad winds up having for Miller  and Miller for dad.  You know, dad would then see him months later and tease him and say, John, you know, I see  that I noticed your change of dress here.  Look at the suit.  He says to him, you're learning, you're catching on.  So it was almost like two people doing their jobs.  Right, right.  Dad knew, even with the cops, dad believed, you know. 
[01:44:00]  You had to have respect for the cops.  The cops had to do their job.  That was their job.  Everybody in life, they had a job to do.  That was always dad's line.  They have a job to do, dad.  They have a job to do.  He would call me dad.  They have a job to do, dad.  And that was it.  You know, you had to respect it.  What did you think, when he finally did get convicted, what did you think of Sammy the  Bull at that point?  I was angry, as one can predict.  I was really angry because I knew that there was a side to Sammy. 
[01:44:30]  I knew, you know, this whole, I have trouble with certain things.  And everybody in this room may not agree with me.  But I think those that are most rational and can separate themselves from my position, meaning, you know, my brother's on trial or dad's trials.  Because if you understand where I'm coming from, I think you'll agree, I have a lot of trouble with guys like Gravano or this new one now, A-Lite, that claims, you know, yeah, I killed 99 people.  You know, Gravano even said, I dismembered my own brother-in-law out of jealousy for the wife, whatever. 
[01:45:00]  Wonderful.  Self-admitted murderers, serial killers, whatever, in the end to turn it over and say, I'm going to admit all of this.  I'm going to owe up to it, but I'm walking.  I want out of here.  I'll serve a year, and the year that I have to give you guys to testify, I want it as time served, I'm out of here.  I want to start, give me the keys to a new house in Arizona, new car, I want a paycheck every week predictably, and I want to go on with a new life, freedom.  These guys get these deals.  They go out there, they're put next to the Smiths, the Jones, anybody in this room, none of us know this. 
[01:45:30]  That's okay.  But give them a guy like John Gotti.  Give them a guy that perhaps most people feel there is some good in.  But give them a guy like that, and they'll let a guy like Sammy go.  And they did.  So I have trouble with that whole thing because, as we know, in Gravano's case, he was not redeemed.  He was not, you know.  Ecstasy, yeah.  Yeah.  He went on to be this mob boss out in Arizona, start his own mob by his own admission, and he became the biggest drug dealer.  You know, colleges and the high schools. 
[01:46:00]  Had his family involved.  A no-no in that life.  And, you know, the cops then said, or the FBI said, well, we're shocked, we're sad.  And please, you know, please, you can believe that a guy like Sammy can redeem himself, change, turn over a whole new leaf because, what, he's purged his soul?  He's told you everything, and now he feels like a great guy?  But you can't believe that John Jr., who wanted out of this life on his own, of his own volition, 12 years ago, and walked away, no tapes, no video, no people saying, well, he did this, this, this, and this. 
[01:46:30]  In fact, it's going to be a tough case for the prosecution to prove to the people that he, even beyond the statute of limitations, had any goings-on with any of these men.  No pictures of any of these men ever coming into his life after that date.  And John has said, I was in the life, I'm owing up to it, I want out, I'm done.  Well, your dad had said to him, too, I think that there was a meeting where he was going to take a plea, because they were going to give him 77 months.  Yeah, I have that tape.  Just to kind of get out of it and to move on with his life, and your father was kind of against it. 
[01:47:00]  And it was like, he had a really smart foreshadow, and he said, if you take the jail, they will never leave you alone.  Well, I'm going to tell you something, I'll let you know in a secret.  On that tape, which I would not give, we were doing a CBS special, and I would not give certain parts of it.  And there was one part that I had to really sit and think long and hard, because I didn't know what I was opening the door to.  And I knew legally, they needed this, for case purposes.  But one part of that tape, you hear dad saying, law enforcement has always maintained that dad would always ask his brother, my brother, when making reference to men in that life. 
[01:47:30]  The terminology or the term was always, how are the cousins, uncles, nephews?  This came from law enforcement, not something that anybody else made up.  On this tape, the last visit between dad and my brother, you hear, dad says to John, if the John says, I want to take this plea, dad, I want to just go in, I want closure, I want to go on with my life, I want to see my children graduate high school, I want to walk my daughter down the aisle.  Dad leans forward, and you know what John means. 
[01:48:00]  John means to say, I want to go in, do my time, and I want to get out of this life, I want out, I want to come home, I want to be Mr. Mom, Daddy, I just want to get out of here.  Dad leans forward and says to John, listen, I don't love you.  He says, I adore you, and I'll support whatever it is you want to do.  He says, but you know, as far as family, he says, we have 410 uncles, nephews, cousins.  Now, obviously, in my family, we don't. 
[01:48:30]  But in that family, they did.  And he says to John, do you understand, if you do what you're going to do, what you want to do, there will be utter chaos, utter chaos in the next five years.  In other words, if John were to leave and take the plea and then leave the life, there's going to be nothing but utter chaos.  What happens then next?  Then there's a follow-up tape where Dad is speaking to his attorney, and he says to the attorney, what does my son think?  This is an elevator?  It goes up, it goes down, he gets off at a different floor that he wants to. 
[01:49:00]  And then he says to the attorney, well, who's next?  And he throws in some names, and he says to the guy something like, shake it up.  You know, take your pick, basically.  But it's the realization that John has been given that pass.  I sat through the trial yesterday, and I hear this witness say, the same witness, by the way, that says he had the affair with me.  I took a lie detector test with a former Queens DA because I didn't want anybody saying, well, you know, she knew the guy, or it was someone in the family. 
[01:49:30]  And this is the guy, what's his name?  A-Light.  A-Light, okay.  Claims he had this affair with me.  Guy is tripping, dreaming.  Never happened.  I mean, it was the most bizarre.  And we still can't figure out why he would throw such a blatant lie in there because it only made it seem worse for him, I would think.  There was no reason, no purpose for it.  It wasn't case-related.  But yesterday, over here, him saying something to the effect of, there's only one way in, there's only one way out.  You cannot leave.  I was an associate.  I couldn't be a MAID member because I'm Albanian or something. 
[01:50:00]  And I'm thinking, wait a minute, you're an associate, so you're not a member, you just said that, yet there's no way for you to get out, you'd be killed.  You're not even a member.  It didn't even make sense.  But he ends it by saying, you know, you're never allowed to just leave.  Well, you know what?  If your father is the guy that's in control, that's in charge, he makes the rules at that point.  They said they gave him a pass.  They gave him a pass because he was John Jr.  Something I read today in the paper, which was very interesting to me, and I don't know why.  And I think, by the way, I think he also got that pass because I don't think a lot of men were happy that he was there to begin with. 
[01:50:30]  I think they felt the age, nepotism, you know, why him kind of thing.  That was in a day when I think somebody, anybody would have wanted that title today.  I don't think you can hand it to these guys.  They'd run from it.  You would assume that the nepotism thing is the succession.  Like, I would find it hard to believe that a man like your father, with all that power built up, and it is the Gotti name,  you would want that to be the controlling name even if he is in jail or, you know, what would happen eventually, him passing on. 
[01:51:00]  You would think that his wish would be to have a Gotti in there as the head guy.  I think that was part of his, because people have often asked me and said, what kind of son would want to walk in his father's shoes knowing this is the life or lifestyle?  What kind of father would want his son to get, you know, even more impactful?  I've done, I've played devil's advocate. 
[01:51:30]  I've spoken to my brother.  Of course, Dad, I could not have that conversation, but I had to guess and kind of fill in the blanks.  I believe strongly that one of the reasons, I should say two of the reasons.  One, I believe, Dad believed, keeping John, my brother, next to him, close to him.  There were constant fight, constant fighting between Dad and John.  John was an 18-year-old, 19-year-old.  They were not getting along.  Dad hated his friends, namely this A-Lite, who yesterday in court claimed he had a great relationship, but Dad even spent nights over the house. 
[01:52:00]  Mom and I looked at each other like, wow, this is like, you know, incredible.  My father actually, at one point when John became, when he embraced him into that world, said,  your friends, these, he called them street punks, he said, they go.  They go, it's as if you never knew them.  And that is what John did from 1990, distanced himself from, namely this person, but a lot of others.  Dad had that belief that I think keeping John next to him was a safer bet than letting John run amok with certain people that he didn't care for 
[01:52:30]  or that maybe he had heard things about or that thought could pull John down.  So I think that was probably one of his motives.  I think the other motive is you're right.  I think keeping it in his grasp, within his grasp, was probably another important factor.  They said that's, well, at least you said, obviously, that was probably why some of the older members signed off because they kind of wanted your dad still running things.  I read something interesting.  I don't know why this kind of made me smile.  They said your father hated Sinatra.  He just didn't like him. 
[01:53:00]  I'm not a Sinatra fan either, but I never say that because Italians really don't care for that.  I know.  I had to think about that one.  I went back and forth.  Personally or professionally?  You know, I think it was, I think, and again, this is my reasoning, I think it had to do with that whole, there was an incident back in the day with Sinatra and a couple of, there was a picture and a couple of guys that were in that life.  And Sinatra had denied any affiliation and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:53:30]  And I think dad and a lot of guys in that life took that as a slight, you know, as a, which if you think about it, I wouldn't blame Sinatra if he had.  I mean, you know, he's in this.  What's he going to say?  Right.  Yeah.  These are my buddies.  You know, yes, I hang out with him at night and yes, that photo is completely accurate.  And that was Tuesday night when we do our, you know, card night.  You know, but I think it, it, it was probably on a personal level.  It just, you know, it had to do with, I believe the way that he had handled that situation namely, but you couldn't.  And then concerts, my God, we were never, I think I was 30 years old before I went to my first concert. 
[01:54:00]  He would not allow us ever in places that he felt were fire traps, death traps, you know, too many people, stadiums.  If my brothers were going to a ball game, it had to be dad and maybe four or five other people, cousins, uncles, everybody.  It was one man per child.  The ratio was one to one, one on one so that everybody can kind of get control of the situation.  So, and then the Barbizon Hotel, you know, not dad, not dad. 
[01:54:30]  Not when he's best, you know, buddy, buddy with Leon Helmsley and has this access to this penthouse apartment up there that is completely, you know, secretive and will be kept on the DL and none of these things.  Like there are things I can answer for him, not even asking him and know the answer to that question.  When you heard the audio, because Anthony alluded to like knowing that he had had been killed and hearing the audio, which was played during the trial, was it hard for you to kind of marry like what you're hearing with the guy you lived with?  Was it hard to put those two things together?  Yeah, it was.  But, you know, then again, and I hate to say it this way, but ironically, a lot of people say his own words hung him, you know, hung himself. 
[01:55:00]  He hung himself rather with his own words.  And I believe that it's the obvious.  But sadly, that wasn't unusual.  When dad was pissed, so to speak, and had conversations with his cohorts, his men, it wasn't unusual to hear that stuff come out of his mouth.  I mean, he would, you had to push him to that point, but when you did, he had a temper like no other. 
[01:55:30]  He had a temper.  He was the proverbial, you know, Archie Bunker.  He had, you know, he was the one that would, he had a take on everything.  And it was like the world according to Gotti instead of the world according to Garp.  So if you knew him, you understood it.  But I remember hearing those words, that tape, and still cringing and thinking, ooh, you know, but that was dad.  That was dad in that life talking to the one particular tape that I heard.  I remember thinking, oh, my God, I was so, because it was at my wedding. 
[01:56:00]  It was when this guy that works for dad or with dad messes up the cars and doesn't send any of the limos to the groom's house, doesn't send, no one gets picked up.  So now here it is, 20 minutes late, everybody's waiting outside the church, including the press, and we're standing there, dad and I, like, you know.  And I'm sure it was quite embarrassing for him.  I was too much in the car, you know, I was too upset and had the, you know, cold feet and all that stuff.  I wasn't thinking, dad is pacing back and forth and back and forth and back. 
[01:56:30]  And when the guy arrives, you know, he gets this guy and he starts to yell and scream and he says, you didn't send the cars?  Where did you send these cars?  And then, of course, there's a couple of choice words, you know, four-letter words that go on.  And I hear this tape and I thought, ooh, I cringed because I remembered the day.  I remembered my wedding.  I remembered the reason.  And I went, uh-oh.  But hearing them in a courtroom or hearing them on a radio or on a television, it is, you have to remember, dad would say this to me when I asked him about it. 
[01:57:00]  And I say something to that effect in the book.  The worst violation that anybody can really, and dad believed this, I think, go through, is finding out after a period of time that you have been bugged somehow.  Your home, your bedroom, your office.  You know, hearing this and then all of a sudden somebody's playing back those tapes for you.  Now, we all have those moments during our day where we're talking about, you know, May next door or the butcher down the block, you know, or, you know, the cute gardener that walked in. 
[01:57:30]  You know, it doesn't mean that we mean this or that we're going to act on this or we're going to hop into bed or in the sack with the gardener while we're married with two kids.  But it is private conversations you think you're having with a best friend, you think you're having with a mom or, you know, whomever, romantic maybe with your, you know, your husband, your wife.  Dad would turn to me and say, I can tell you, it doesn't feel good.  You know, hearing your words come back at you in a court of law or publicly for millions of people to hear, he'd say, only that person, meaning him, can explain what I meant when I said what I said. 
[01:58:00]  He said, but why even bother?  They have the words.  It's, you know, they have their take.  Leave it alone.  He hated your, your fiancee, too.  Hated him.  Carmine, right?  Yeah.  And on the wedding day when he wasn't showing up, you're, you're.  He hoped it was for good.  Your, your father didn't, yeah, because he, I know he told you that you could, we could just cancel us and make it a Christmas party. 
[01:58:30]  And he said he was about five minutes away from hunting the guy down like an animal.  Yeah.  Oh, and that would have given him great pleasure, I believe.  I believe.  Now thinking back, well, anyway.  Why did we like him, by the way?  Yeah.  He, you know, dad, for me especially, I think in the family, I was the one that was serious about school.  I was in St. John's at like 15, going to be 16 in November.  I was born at the end of the year and then skipped a year because of my grades.  So dad had these dreams for me.  At the time, I intended to go to law school. 
[01:59:00]  I was going to become this lawyer and dad was thrilled.  Even though women belonged in the kitchen, you know, home, married to a guy that could provide, he would make the exception when it came to his daughter, especially me.  But he just believed that Carmine was so far away from the bar he had set for me.  If dad had his choice, I would have married a Jewish guy, a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant.  That was dad's wish for me.  Dad wanted a life so unlike what mom had or what he had. 
[01:59:30]  This is what he wanted for me.  And Carmine certainly didn't fit that bill, not in dad's opinion.  Carmine was the wild guy in the neighborhood, the cool, good-looking, you know, guy that the women kind of, you know, chased.  He was popular.  He was this.  That was not the guy dad wanted for me.  And I was this geeky kid that went to all-girls Catholic school, you know, went to school every day, came back, did my work, didn't hang out, didn't really have friends.  And there's this guy paying attention to me that's a popular guy, and I'm thinking, wow, this is really cool. 
[02:00:00]  Were guys afraid to hit on you because of who your dad was?  That's been terrified.  Really?  I would think they were, but then it was more to the other extreme.  It was more that guys would try and use me.  I remember all of a sudden my prom coming up and everybody asking me to go.  It was like I had no boyfriend, and all of a sudden I had five authors.  And I remember this one guy who was so cute, and everybody thought, wow, you know, in the neighborhood.  And my girlfriends thought, wow, and I accepted.  I was so excited.  I went out and got the dress and this, and I'll never forget leaving the prom. 
[02:00:30]  Things were so bad.  It was so obvious that he was using me to get to dad.  He wanted to be, everywhere we went, he would, the gym teacher, he would introduce me and say, this is Victoria, my date, Victoria, her father's John Gotti, you know.  And it was, oh, it was horrible.  I was about, I don't know, 16, 15 or 16 to his 18 or 19.  But I remember I got so upset at one point that I literally, on the service road of one of the highways.  Shot him?  No, I wish I had. 
[02:01:00]  No, but close.  At about 4 a.m., coming back from prom, I remember saying to the driver, please pull over.  And he pulled, I mean, he even took me, for instance, my dad had this, he had some part ownership of this club at the time, Eliphas, somewhere I think in Queens.  He wanted to go there, you know, after the prom.  He wanted to walk into dad's place.  He wanted to walk in with dad's daughter.  You know, that's when I said, no, put my foot down.  And somewhere on that service road, I remember telling the driver, pull over. 
[02:01:30]  And the driver did.  And I said to the guy, out.  And he just looked at me and he said, oh, you got to be kidding me.  You know, you're not throwing me out here.  I said, oh, I am.  I took off the corsage.  I threw it at him.  And I said, out.  And he said something like, you know, you can't do, I said, either you're going to get out of this car.  I said, oh, there's a pay phone off the block.  I'm going to call my dad to come and get me.  He got out.  Said some choice words, you know, got out.  And I remember I just cried all the way home because I knew he wasn't in that car for me.  You know, he was in that car to impress dad.  And the ironic thing is I have a picture of that day, that night, and you see in the picture it's myself, the guy, and dad. 
[02:02:00]  Dad's actually in the middle, sitting down on a kitchen booth.  I'm on one side, all dressed with the corsage.  And here's this guy, you know, in his tuxedo, you know, typical early 80s, late 70s, early 80s.  And in the picture you see he's not staring at me.  He's staring at dad.  But he's like just staring down at dad and his face is all lit up and, you know, dad's looking straight ahead at the camera.  I'm looking straight.  And he's just staring down. 
[02:02:30]  So, yeah, that was part of the problem was the guys that wanted to really more impress dad than me.  There was quite the allure with your dad.  I mean, he was the last of the big bosses.  And it was young enough, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, people just thought, he's that essential casting.  He's handsome.  Exactly.  And Jimmy brought it up before.  There was this almost where you were rooting for him to slip the, like, I think because it was very movie-like. 
[02:03:00]  He was the Robin Hood.  He was the Jesse James.  He was the guy, you know, yes, go.  You know, thumb your nose up at the government.  You know, tell them, you know, this is enough is enough for, you know, taxes.  Go right ahead.  You know, go for it.  They were kind of cheering it on because they were the underdog.  I understand that part.  But the fact of the matter is, and things I think a lot of people knew, and I still, I wonder why then there was this allure and this, boy, I hope he slips this, was that people knew he was responsible for the death of a lot of people. 
[02:03:30]  But, like, what do you think did that?  What do you think makes people look at your dad, and at the time, especially at the height of his, if you want to say, popularity.  It wasn't like, you're right, they didn't pretend they didn't know.  Yeah, it wasn't like, oh, this guy, you know, obviously he put on great parties for the neighborhood.  The fireworks displays and everything are legendary.  But here is the guy in charge of an organization that is a criminal organization that kills people. 
[02:04:00]  And they're looking at John Gotti like, this guy, the hero, I want him to get away from the feds.  They're cheering him on.  And, you know, I think the only way I can answer that is to say things like, look at the success of the Sopranos.  You know, it's like the whole world all of a sudden said, we choose this as our number one show because we love it.  We can't get enough of it.  This is like a cult.  This is our cult classic here, and this is what we want.  I think it has a lot to do with, and, you know, it's funny because I don't mean to sound or come off, you know, being arrogant. 
[02:04:30]  That's not my intention, but I'm going to speak my mind.  And that is to say, and some people take it differently, but that is to say, I believe, at least from my experiences and speaking to the people I have, reading the letters, the tens of thousands of letters Dad would get from all over the country, namely Europe, London, big, big, big, you know, more so than Italy, you know, London.  But reading these things, learning or hearing what I did, I believe that a lot of men feel this is, Dad is what, or Dad did what they wished, their alter ego at some point could have. 
[02:05:00]  Dad took a walk on the wild side, and there was these guys that felt, that's cool.  I'd like to, you know, put that suit on.  I'd like to walk down, have the respect of whatever, and walk in there like a tough guy, and, you know, that's it.  That's why I want to be secretly inside.  The women, on the other hand, romanticize the whole life.  They thought it was attractive, it was sexy.  These men, ooh, mysterious, dark, handsome, you know. 
[02:05:30]  Dad was out of sensual casting.  Dad was, for all intents and purposes, I think a better, more improved version of Michael Corleone in The Godfather, you know.  He wasn't this old, scraggly, scraggly young guy.  That's why if you look at it and look back in history, even, you know, Clyde Barrow and John Dillinger, I mean, there was that allure that you don't want the story to end is what it is.  If he gets convicted and goes to prison, the movie's over, you know. 
[02:06:00]  So I think maybe that kept the allure going and that, boy, I hope he slips this one again.  You know, it's almost like watching.  I think that he died, I think, and judging again from the letters and whatnot that we received, I mean, I remember when he died, the press coverage alone.  You would have thought it was a dignitary, the Pope, you know, you could.  And I worked at the Post then.  I couldn't believe it.  I just couldn't believe it.  You know, and I'm the one that's supposed to say, you know, hmm, you know, kind of. 
[02:06:30]  I just couldn't believe it.  But the way that he died, I believe, too, you know, Dad went down like a man's man.  Dad wasn't, no one was breaking him.  You could throw him in that cell 24-7, you know, 5x6.  You could throw his chemo rods, you know, in there and, you know, deny him a hospital.  You could do what you want.  You could let him have his heart attack where he, you know, killed off, I say in the book, 70% of his heart muscle and laid in his own blood for, you know, 12, 13 hours. 
[02:07:00]  Do what you want.  His attitude was, keep coming at me.  I'll keep, you know, you're not breaking me.  And I think the fact that they didn't ever break him, I think people just cheered him on even more and said, you know what, the guy did go down with his dignity.  He went down like a man, like a real man, you know, in today's age, you know, all you have to do is say when you get arrested, what do you want me to say?  Please, give me, I'll sign on the dotted line.  I'm out of here.  I can't do a day in jail.  We know, but you're talking to a room full of fruits.  We definitely understand.  One thing I wanted to say, too, like one part, I think the allure was it was the way he kind of came to be in the position he was in. 
[02:07:30]  It was in movie fair.  I mean, Paul Castellano was known as the boss of bosses.  Right.  And then he's gunned down in 1985.  But in New York at 5 p.m. by four, it was like something that would have happened.  Right.  In the film The Godfather.  And I think that was part of it, too.  It was like the balls on this guy to do it that way.  Right.  And then just walk around looking great and beating the rap.  I mean, he really was the last of the time.  It was almost like, right.  The end of the era.  The end of the era, though. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  You know, I mean, Dad would constantly pass comments like, you know, there are so few men left in this world.  There are so few men left.  And I think he meant, obviously, his world.  But he would say things like that.  There are so few men left in this world.  You know, everywhere he turned around, somebody else, you know, you were reading something else about a rat or this or that.  And it was becoming so easy.  You know, Dad's attitude was, hmm, not a bad country in America, he'd say.  You come here, you know, you do a life of crime.  You reap the rewards all your life. 
[02:08:30]  You do what you have to do.  You, I mean, really go with it and go with it.  And then all of a sudden at the end you get caught.  No sweat.  No big deal.  You don't even get time anymore.  All you need to say is, I'll give you this guy, that guy, that guy.  Give me the wire.  I'll do what you want.  Work for you for how long?  A year or two?  I can handle that.  As opposed to what?  Life in prison?  The chair?  I can handle that.  They do it.  And that's it.  They walk away.  I mean, I think the most eye-opening experience for Dad was when he saw, I mean, he wouldn't 
[02:09:00]  really owe up to it, but God knows on that visit enough of it came out here and there,  but I think was seeing Sam Gravano on Diane Sawyer.  I think that just, you know, and so I remember him saying something to me on that visit that  day that I thought, he knows he's being taped.  This is, you know, he's pushing it now.  And I'm wondering, does he know what he's saying?  You know, because this is not good.  But he said something to me to the effect of, uh, he'll get his day, I reckon him.  Him and I will meet again. 
[02:09:30]  And I live for that moment.  He kept saying, I live for that moment.  That moment never came, though.  That's kind of an odd thing that he was able to.  Yeah.  Well, he was locked away, you know, in this whatever.  And then at the time that it came to light that Gravano wasn't this changed guy, this  this pill of the community, dad was already, I think dad died, what, three weeks later.  So there was no one taking over the reins that could have said like, oh, this son of a  bitch or, you know, let's. 
[02:10:00]  You know, I thought of that, too.  And I thought, wow, how easy.  You know, how easy.  The guy's living in broad.  Not only is he living in broad daylight open, you know, in Arizona, but he's got this mob  going, you know, he's the biggest drug dealer there.  He's got his family involved.  You know, what's up with this?  And I think dad felt the same way.  I think dad felt that everybody else out there in the world was just incompetent, plain  incompetent.  And it was part of his angst being locked away in this cell in this super max max prison, 
[02:10:30]  you know, so you can complain, you can talk, but you're talking for the most part on deaf  ears.  Because now my brother's gone, you know, he's got just his brother left.  His brother gets indicted.  You know, it's like, then what?  That's it.  Wasn't it also that everybody was kind of scrambling for their own lives, like other families?  And, you know, I think most of the Rico statues, I think really, I mean, again, put guys away  for life.  And it's hard to get a guy to do life.  That's right.  You get him to do six years, but life is a long time.  Or that they're going to want to, exactly, willingly.  I mean, it's not, you know, it's not something any of us would want. 
[02:11:00]  But if these guys can get out of it so easily, too, by, you know, like this guy on the stand  yesterday that said, you know, he said, the guy asked him in previous testimony, well,  are you hoping to get a deal as sweet as Sammy Gravano's deal?  And he said, no, sweeter.  I'm hoping to get sweeter.  And the guy was like, you know, why do you think that, do you think of Junior as being  bigger than Gotti?  Because Gotti was this, you know.  And the guy says, it's a lot harder for them to get Junior, you know, meaning the mistrials 
[02:11:30]  and the this.  And he said, I'm hoping for better and I'm going to get better.  So, you know, fifth, really.  He took the plea on the first.  Then he had three.  And this is the fifth one.  What's your opinion on Curtis, Lewa?  I hate to say it.  I have no opinion.  To me, he's just like a misnomer.  He doesn't even exist.  He's a publicity hound or I should say, I don't know if we can curse on this radio.  Yes, you can.  Be encouraged.  Okay, great.  He's a whore. 
[02:12:00]  But he has this thing.  I understand his gripe.  If he has a gripe, take it up with the men.  That's where I, you know, how I was raised.  Take it up with the men.  Dad, my brother.  When you start attacking women and children, me, I can handle my own.  I mean, he can't say anything that's going to make me, you know, ruffle my feathers.  I wouldn't give him.  Yeah, he's kind of bad-mouthed you for quite a few years.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Horrible things.  Horrible things that you wouldn't say to an enemy.  But if you're a real man, if you're a gentleman, it wouldn't come out of your mouth. 
[02:12:30]  So enough said right at that.  But to attack kids that at the time were, what, 16, 17.  He just, for no other rhyme or reason than to say they're abortions, they're degenerates in the making, they're the future donned, you know.  He's just so disgusting that it's, there's nothing to, people would ask me, well, how do you feel?  I don't feel about it.  I don't even think about him.  He's not that important to me.  Obviously, they weren't able to pin that his...  I think it's killing him more.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it kills him more.  I think he just wants that glory.  He wants to be able to take down a Gotti based on what happened to him. 
[02:13:00]  Obviously, the taxi ride where he gets in to go to work, he gets shot up.  I don't even know that it's that, that he wants to take down a Gotti.  I think he just wants that spotlight back again for whatever it is, a week, two weeks, three weeks, just enough so that somebody can listen to him talk.  Have you heard any stories on that whole episode of what happened in that taxi cab, who it was, why maybe he was being targeted?  I can tell you one thing.  If it was John Gotti, he wouldn't be telling the story right now. 
[02:13:30]  He wouldn't have it handled more efficiently.  You know, you can't say, like, he would go on to say, oh, it was this guy, and he picked him out of a lineup.  The guy that he picked out, he said this guy was under, and this is why it didn't wash or fly in court.  The guy, he said, was under, hiding under the dashboard, the front dashboard.  The guy was probably bigger than all four of you put together in this room.  His name was Stevie Kaplan, and he was a huge guy.  Not even that he was heavy, big guy, big guy.  Couldn't, could barely fit in the front seat, passengers' side, let alone under the dashboard. 
[02:14:00]  And then claims the guy climbed over the seat, you know, chased him as he tried to get out, and he made a mad day.  I mean, if you listen to Sliwet tell it, it's the stuff of superheroes, you know, the stuff that makes superheroes what they are.  Well, he did get shot, I mean, he did, you know, it did happen.  His best friend, his best friend, who testified on the stand, and many other guys that were next to him say, you know, he had so many enemies at that time.  He had been going in and out of so many drug dens, and guys up in, and. 
[02:14:30]  That's true, yeah.  You know, it's hard to say, and then someone that was at the scene said he was unconscious, but his then wife said to him, this was Gotti, right?  This was Gotti.  He's out cold.  He's out of it.  And after the fact, she turns to the Guardian Angels and says, we're going to Howard Beach.  We're going to surround Gotti's house.  We're going to go do a march.  We're going to call the press.  And the guy that was there as well and heard everything and watched everything and said to her, what are you talking about?  She says, you heard him.  He just admitted that it was Gotti. 
[02:15:00]  And the guy said, he's unconscious.  He didn't say anything.  And then she said, no, he nodded.  I saw him nod or he blinked or something.  And this guy looked at her and said, if you think I'm getting in a car and I'm going over to Gotti's house to stage this march for what?  For press purposes?  He's like, do you understand?  He said, that's the FBI's job.  He said, we're small guys.  We take care of stuff that say the NYPD.  We're not ones that we're going to go into this, you know, house, march on this mob boss's house.  You know, are you nuts?  They stop turnstile jumpers. 
[02:15:30]  They're not looking for the fucking Campinos.  You know, we definitely got to get her out of here.  They're telling us you have a bunch of press.  I don't want to leave.  We could talk to you for hours.  Believe me.  This book is fascinating.  You're obviously a great writer.  It's what you do.  Thank you.  I mean, we just said she's got to go.  Yeah.  Oh, she could stay.  Oh, she can?  What's going on?  Oh, she has a few minutes?  Mike has to go.  Oh, Mike has to go?  Oh, it's me.  Damn it.  Mike has to go.  I got to go.  All right.  You have to go?  I got to go.  Big star?  Oh, you know. 
[02:16:00]  I hear you're doing GMA, so our listeners could check you out on TV now.  Dude, I'm a Christmas ham.  You know what I do?  I fall in the car.  They take me somewhere, and I tell a story about falling in the car.  Victoria, you know Mike Rowe?  I watch his show.  Dirty Jobs.  Dirty Jobs.  That's a heck of it.  I'm going to read your book.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know what?  I meant to ask you.  This is an amazing photo on the back.  Thank you.  I kept staring at it.  I mean, that says more than anything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, really more than anything.  It's her wedding photo with her father.  Yeah.  I'm crying, as you can see.  I'm crying.  I think it hit me.  It hit me that night that, you know, there's really no coming back now. 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  You're leaving home.  You're leaving dad and mom's grasp.  But it says, I mean, it's like, of all the pictures, not to need a caption, you know?  Yeah.  That's awesome.  You're right.  Well, sorry, you have to leave, Mike.  No worries.  I mean, I'll be back tomorrow and the day after that.  That's it.  Feel free.  Believe me.  I guess maybe the day after that.  You can come back.  Stop it whenever the hell you want.  You're in town.  Come on back.  Actually, I might be around Friday.  You do anything Friday?  Come on in.  Right.  Jimmy's going to be doing that.  I'll be in Los Angeles on television.  But I mean, Jimmy's actually doing Leno, so it'd be nice to have a couple bodies in here, 
[02:17:00]  Mike.  Let's see what I can do.  Yeah, let's try to do that.  That'd be great.  All right, cool.  But if you're not, the premiere of Dirty Jobs is Tuesday on the Discovery Channel.  Yeah, it's going to be fun and we'll get back into the, I'll get some mattress.  I'll get you a new mattress if I can.  All right.  No, we've got to talk to you more.  Come back Friday if you can.  We'll go to the mattresses.  Come back for coffee on Friday.  Got that one.  Good luck with the book.  Thank you.  I got that one.  Oh, Jesus.  I got that one.  We should let Victoria go, too, because we've got to take a pretty long break and we've got to  set up for Jeffrey Ross.  Oh, Jeff is coming in, too.  So, I think this is a good place to end this. 
[02:17:30]  This was fascinating.  Yeah, thanks so much.  We had a good time, guys.  I really did.  I was looking forward to coming and seeing you guys.  The book is called...  You know who we are?  Amazing.  Of course I know who you are.  Oh, boy.  We don't like that.  Well, the book is...  Why?  You're a scary woman to interview, even though...  Because not that you're...  Jesus.  No, no, no.  Let me fucking finish this.  No, I mean that in a nice way.  You curse.  You just curse.  You curse on this.  Oh, I love that.  You don't want...  I love that.  We don't want any gaudies to kind of know us, I guess, just because...  No, we want them to like us.  We want them to know us.  But you're scared of them not know us at all. 
[02:18:00]  You don't want to say the wrong thing.  Gotcha.  Right.  You want to phrase every question carefully.  Normally, with guests, we don't give a shit.  We'll say anything.  But with you, it's like, oh, let's just...  Do you find that people tiptoe around what they say to you a lot of times?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you listen to our tapes...  But seriously speaking, seriously speaking, I heard a lot about you guys, too.  Yeah, that's true.  And I got to say, I always got a kick out of you guys.  Half the times, I was giving you that thumbs up, you know, saying, oh, yeah, you know.  See, it got back to you.  Because if you listen to our tapes, we kind of praised the old man over the years. 
[02:18:30]  But no, getting back to you guys, though, too, I think there's such a hypocrisy out there  about the whole, you know, what can you say, what can't you say, and, oh, let's just all  be, you know, out there with our little ties and our white, you know, collars, and you  guys just tell it like it is and go for it.  And it's a bunch of, like you said, a bunch of hypocrites that maybe one person was offended  by something, and they make it seem like an outrage that everybody is offended.  Like what you did in the world, right.  Everything's your fault.  It's like, you know, shut up.  Exactly.  One guy's offended.  We're going to offend people with whatever you say is going to offend somebody. 
[02:19:00]  Everybody is not going to be happy all the time.  How's your brother's kids doing as their father goes through his own thing?  It's difficult.  It's difficult.  I mean, you see a noticeable change in their personalities, and they're very, you know, they're  young.  The oldest is 18, and the youngest is two, six kids, you know, and it's hard.  Well, you've been through the same thing they're going through, which is watching your father  go through a very long legal process.  Is there like this kind of feeling of invincibility, like he's going to be okay, or every time it  happens, you're like, this is it. 
[02:19:30]  This is where he's going.  No.  Every time.  You never take that for granted.  It's that same, you know, and I think watching my mother is the worst.  You know, one trial was the open heart surgery, you know, the double bypass.  The second was the monster stroke, the brain surgery.  Now it's like if, you know, I hear every day from her how sick she feels and that she's  not making it through this trial and blah, blah, blah.  This is her baby.  This is her son.  You know, it's scary.  It scares me.  It scares me.  She scares me. 
[02:20:00]  Does she blame your dad for that?  You said that she wrote some harsh letters to him when he was in jail about John Jr.  I think she did, but I think now she started, like just the other day she said to me, listening  to some of the trials, she finally said to me, she said, you know, I held it against this  man for so long.  She said, now I'm starting to understand why he chose to keep your brother, my son, our  son next to him the way he did.  She sees the reasoning now.  In other words, I think she believes now that if dad had let him go, just give him free  reign, God knows what he would have fell into, what crowd, the idiots, the town. 
[02:20:30]  As I said to you, all the wannabes wanted to latch on to John.  If they wanted to latch on to me for whatever purpose, definitely twofold for him.  And dad saw that.  He saw right through that and he thought that was the worst of all, you know, is the people  that are masquerading to be something they're not.  And that's what I think he tried to protect John against.  All right.  Well, I guess that is a good place to write the book is honestly what I've read of it  is it's fascinating.  Jimmy has been raving about it for the last day because you're a family that we want to 
[02:21:00]  hear about.  And it's obviously, it's nice that who's somebody who is a professional writer writing  the memoir of the family as opposed to just kind of speaking it out to someone.  It's called This Family of Mine, What It Was Like Growing Up Gaudi.  And it's obviously going to be a bestseller.  And just last question, are you going to be doing any signings or is this just...  So far, one signing that I, you know, signings are tough.  They're really tough.  And after seven books, you know, you feel like maybe it's been enough signings, so to speak.  But I'm doing one in Huntington at the Book Review Saturday, so it's 7 p.m. 
[02:21:30]  A little independent store?  Yeah.  No, it's actually huge.  It's a big store.  No, the Book Review gets...  That's where I met President Clinton.  Everyone goes there.  No, you got to do independent.  Everybody goes there.  And it's a great place, yes.  I met Clinton there.  Huntington's great.  You got to do independence to get on the bestseller list.  You do the big ones and you got to do independence as well.  They were always good to me.  I had a lot of signings there and they're just...  They're a great place to go.  You should stop by Myrbo's Restaurant.  It's right up the street.  F.H. Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village.  What's the name of it?  F.H. Riley's.  Oh, I've got to go in.  Yeah? 
[02:22:00]  Shepherd's Pie?  What kind of food?  We got some...  Yeah, American.  Americana.  Oh, that's it.  A little of everything.  We do a pasta thing on Sundays.  Hey, all right.  We make a good sauce.  I'm going to name drop.  There you go.  I'm name dropping.  My brother will freak out if you walk through the front door.  But it's got a good reputation.  You know what?  You're going to be talking about this on Monday morning because I'm going to walk through the front  door on Saturday.  You'll see.  Saturday night.  All right, so the signing is Saturday.  Word is out.  Victoria Gotti at My Brother's Restaurant.  Nice.  Thanks for coming.  It was really great talking to you.  Thank you, guys.  It was really nice being here. 
[02:22:30]  And it's a very, very open and honest book.  And it's a real insight into, you know, let's be honest, a guy that we all never got an  insight on.  And if you go to My Brother's Restaurant, call ahead for a reservation.  I will.  Because we get very busy.  I certainly will.  Like you wouldn't have a table.  I'm just kidding.  No, I certainly will.  I'm kidding.  Victoria Gotti.  Thanks a lot, Victoria.  It was a pleasure.  Thank you.  Same here.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll continue.  You're hoping Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, who did an amazing job with this effing  interview.  That was great.  You did great, Jimmy.  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:30]  You know, a lot of people kind of looked at him and was like, he was kind of a bigger 
[02:24:00]  than life character.  I never saw him live.  You always saw him on TV.  And it played out like a movie.  And the media made him.  His life played out like a mob movie.  And the media made him this super star.  A rock star, basically.  So, yeah, you kind of, you know, you were like, wow, that's, even though, you know, he was  involved in maybe some situations where people may have been injured.  Yeah.  It was kind of a cool, like, if you distance yourself from the reality of it, he was the 
[02:24:30]  definitive Don, you know?  Sure.  That's what it was.  And people like, like she was saying, people are fascinated with The Sopranos, the highest  rated shows, The Godfather.  People love it.  Goodfellas, things like that.  But this was a real life version of that.  And it played out that way, you know?  And then to hear the personal side of it is almost like when you're watching The Sopranos  and, you know, Tony goes home and has to deal with that bullshit at home. 
[02:25:00]  And then he's, you know, got to deal with his work stuff.  And Jimmy pointed out during the break, just hearing her say, dad.  Yeah, that was an odd feeling.  Obviously, her dad.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  She goes, well, you know, I talked to dad about that.  And you're like, dad, that's, you know, it's John Gotti.  Her brother's in the paper every day on trial.  Her father was in the paper every day.  And she's talking these personal insight on these people. 
[02:25:30]  And it is weird to hear John Gotti, because some of the idiots are going, why don't you  go after her?  Like, for what?  She's not, she didn't order hits on people.  She's just the daughter giving a personal.  She's a writer.  Yeah, she's giving her angle.  Everyone knows what her dad did.  He went to jail.  The one thing I wish we pushed her on, just one thing I was saying during the break, when  she said dad was scared of, like, crowds and whatnot.  So when we all went to a ball game, every kid had a man.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was more paranoia that, you know, one of his enemies was going to get to one of 
[02:26:00]  his family members.  That had nothing to do with, like, claustrophobia and crowded places.  And I wish we would have pushed her on that a little bit.  He didn't like flying, though.  I know she said he hated to fly.  He was very scared to fly.  Yeah.  So, yeah, maybe he did have a weird thing with, but yeah, that's a pretty understandable  fear.  You kids are out.  Claustrophobic.  And Mike Rowe's coming back on Friday.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, the scheduling was a little weird there.  Yeah, I didn't like the schedule in there, but supposedly she was only going to do 20  minutes, but we were into it, and I just enjoyed listening to her. 
[02:26:30]  People couldn't see it, but she almost started crying when she was talking about it.  It's amazing.  All these years later, it's so many years later, and she still has a very close feeling  for her brother who was killed.  And, I mean, not that I wish you could have seen it, but it was a very real moment for  her talking about that when he died.  She almost started crying.  Jimmy the Creep writes...  I didn't write a word.  Listen to this.  No, I'm kidding.  Opie, your brother has three days to figure out how to make shepherd's pie.  Tell him I said good luck, bro. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Good luck, bro.  Why the fuck did I invite her to the restaurant?  Your brother's going to come out all nervous.  Invite her to the restaurant.  Piece of cheesecake shaking.  We don't have it, but...  We would love to have her at the restaurant, but why did I invite her?  I'm sure she'd be very gracious.  She goes, don't be surprised when I walk in that door Saturday night.  The pest came in and didn't pay for their drinks?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  How funny would it be if she just started throwing food around saying,  this is shit.  And he's like, I apologize.  I apologize.  Some guy grabs Opie's collar, smashes a bottle over his head. 
[02:27:30]  They all laugh.  Imagine it becomes the new social club.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm in way over my head.  New social club.  I come in here a bit disheveled every Monday.  You know, they're treating me like half a fag over here.  Oh, my God.  She's very nice.  Well, the restaurant business is competitive, so I could use the help.  Shit goes in the front door, out the back door.  Before you know it, you light a torch.  You light a match. 
[02:28:00]  I wrote Brett immediately.  He hasn't gotten back to me.  He has no idea what he's waking up to today.  He's got to...  He's got to...  There's a good possibility that John Gotti's daughter will be at the restaurant Saturday night.  Yeah.  That's going to freak him out a little bit.  Yeah, you're going to...  Who's going to bring over the drinks and get shot in the foot?  Oh, no.  I thought you said, I'm okay, spider.  Shepherd's pie.  Does anyone have a good recipe for shepherd's pie?  Because when she said that, I'm like, yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  We got to fix that up.  That's what he...  That's his...  Yeah, yeah.  That's the special on Tuesday nights.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.  Yeah, we do that.  Sure.  You may want to grab the feedbacks from the last hour, Kevin from Connecticut.  I love the people that have their opinion, and that's fine, and think that their opinion is everything.  If you really want to know the truth, Kevin from Connecticut, and you know I like you and stuff,  the feedback on Victoria Gotti was way more positive than negative. 
[02:29:00]  So, yeah, all right.  You get people that just want to...  You want to grab the feedbacks from the last hour?  Okay, from the last hour, the feedback was definitely more positive than negative.  There was definitely people that weren't into the Victoria Gotti segment, wanted more Mike Rowe,  but there were an overwhelming amount of feedbacks that were into it.  So, there you go.  You get people that just want shits and giggles, as I like to say.  Shits and giggles.  And then sometimes, that's what we do.  We do a fucking interview, especially with her. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, I'm fascinated with all things mob.  So, this was very fucking fun to do.  Interesting for me.  Her father.  We monitor our Twitters, the instant feedback, the phone calls, what Ant's got in front of him,  a little pal talk action.  And trust me, we get an overall view of how things are going at any given time when we do the show.  And the fact is, more people liked it than didn't.  I was interested... 
[02:30:00]  If you didn't like it, I'm sorry.  What can I tell you?  What she had to say, and I was very interested in...  It's the first time she's actually opened up about the family like that,  and you just don't hear insight like that.  Who else are you going to hear it from?  Who else is going to come in and talk about John Gotti on a personal level?  You just don't get to hear it.  And look, the guy's like a pop culture figure, whether you like him or didn't like him.  He was one of those guys that was...  He led, obviously, a criminal life, but he was a very romanticized guy.  Interesting.  Strange time, that whole time period, too.  Because somebody goes... 
[02:30:30]  I saw somebody write something like, you know,  a real Don doesn't pose for magazine pictures.  That was the time.  That was the Don of the fucking, you know, late 80s.  When the press would dive in, when people wanted the reality of a situation.  They wanted to see what it was all about.  He was the last of them.  That was it.  After him?  Who?  What do you got?  And as I pointed out so eloquently,  the Paul Castellano hit 
[02:31:00]  is when everybody fell in love with John Gotti.  Spark Steakhouse.  Gunned down.  The ball did no sense.  Bad, dude.  Gunned down at 5 p.m.  In that fashion,  was something out of a movie.  Yeah.  No one  does fucking hits like that.  Four guys dressed exactly alike  while wearing trench coats and these weird hats.  Kill him and his bodyguard.  It's like, how do you...  You can't turn the channel.  Oh, the hole in his eye  and that stupid cigar hanging out of his mouth.  Oh, that poor bastard. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, did he get it?  I hope his steak was good.  Ow.  They got him.  Gotti was on his way to that meeting  and if the hit didn't go down,  he would have had a meeting with Castellano.  Yeah.  But he thought his brother was going to be killed  because I think he'd been indicted for heroin  or something that had something to do with the heroin  and Paul Castellano was one of those guys  who didn't believe in drugs at all.  And that's what I remember.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Keep it in the dark neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Let them lose their souls.  Yeah, Jimmy took a...  Yeah, you did a good job. 
[02:32:00]  Read the book and...  I didn't mean to babble.  Nah.  None of us were really...  I was barely talking about...  No one was really babbling.  We were just listening.  We were fascinated by just listening to her.  All right.  John from Johnny K, Dan.  He's hurting.  Hi, John.  He's hurting.  He's hurting.  Yeah.  Entertainment Tonight dramatically reports  that John and K plus eight  is now Kate plus eight.  So what happens to John?  He gets his own show?  Fucking Young Whores, it's called. 
[02:32:30]  John and his Young Whores.  Yeah.  I'm great with that.  It's the follow-up to Kate plus eight.  Yeah.  Right on the same network and everything.  They're holding him to his contract.  They're kind of making him sit out.  Are they?  Yeah.  The ratings, basically for the people that...  I guess no one really gives a shit in our runnings,  but when the whole marriage breakup thing went down,  the ratings were ridiculous,  and then they continue with the season,  and the ratings are horrendous.  Oh, really?  So TLC, they're like,  we got to do something.  So they're cutting John loose,  saying, all right,  it's got to be about Kate  dealing with raising eight kids 
[02:33:00]  by, quote, herself.  Oh, yeah, herself.  While John is busy, you know,  doing what he's doing.  I hope a young black gentleman comes in  and just ravages her,  takes her, you know,  sweeps her off her feet.  Kate plus nine and a quarter.  And it's just all about the children  not getting any attention  as she just fucks all the time.  Now that's a show.  Someone's asking what happened to John Miller  because he was brought up  in the Victoria Gotti segment.  He's still around, right? 
[02:33:30]  Nothing happened to him.  Nothing happened to him.  The reporter that was...  Oh, you won't see him no more.  The reporter that was in Gotti's face  all the time,  nothing happened to him.  I believe he still pops up on TV.  He was too public.  You couldn't just kill him  because the reality is  he's too public a guy.  Well, you could.  We could say that  he was a bad newspaper reporter.  He was involved in drugs.  I enjoyed the Sliwa answer, too,  because I've always thought  that guy made a lot of enemies. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, with the Guardian Angels,  he was constantly getting into  low-level thugs' faces,  getting into their business.  And, you know,  he, as somebody thought,  got his comeuppance.  But whether it was Gotti or not,  they were never able  to pin that on him.  Yeah.  Eric Walker from Facebook writes, 
[02:34:30]  Opie, tell your bro  to use Gordon Ramsay's  shepherd's pie recipe.  It's available online.  Thank God.  Someone print that out immediately  and slide it under the door  of FH Riley's, please.  He's, my brother's probably  sweating right now  and panicking.  Shepherd's pie.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.  He's Googling his ass off right now.  Google, whatever.  All right.  Here's Entertainment Tonight  dramatically reporting  that John and Kate Plus 8  is now Kate Plus 8.  What is John and Kate Plus 8  minus John? 
[02:35:00]  It's Kate Plus 8,  which has just been announced  as the new title  of the revamped show.  TLC declared today  that John Gosselin  is not only out of the title,  he will only appear  on a less regular basis.  The series,  starting November 2nd,  will now focus on Kate's journey  as a single mom  raising eight kids.  Nearly 11 million viewers  tuned in when John and Kate  announced they were  calling it quits.  We asked TV Guide magazine's  Craig Tomashoff  if single Kate will rate.  For the TLC audience,  Kate is the one  everybody wants to see. 
[02:35:30]  Wait, wait.  I guarantee you  she demanded that, by the way,  that he be taken out of the title.  Well, she demanded it  because she wants to be famous  and she's using her kids  to be famous  and she sees the ratings are bad  so she's like,  look, I can do this still.  They said for what audience?  Kate is the one that's...  For the TLC audience.  Oh, it's a bunch of women  that watch TLC for the most part.  And that's the one that...  Whose horrible ass is that?  That's Kate.  Is that Kate's horrible ass?  I mean, she had eight kids.  Three kids, it ain't bad. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, it's a spankable ass.  Prolapse, fucking vag.  Oh, I'm sure they put it  all back together.  You think they shoved it  back in there?  They just put it all  back together somehow.  Poke it back in.  A tamping rod.  You think the doctor said  good enough?  Yeah, good enough.  Tied the last knot  and said, all right,  this is the best I can do.  Just relax and do a handstand  for a week.  You'll be fine.  Exactly.  Mark my word,  I am a seer  of weird things.  This Kate.  Yeah.  Mark my word,  she wants fame so bad 
[02:36:30]  and she knows  it's on the fence right now.  If it doesn't work  with this Kate plus eight,  she's done  and she doesn't want  to hear that.  Yeah, she don't want  to be done.  She gets pregnant again.  Mark my word,  within the year.  From who?  From who?  That, I don't know it.  Probably Clyde Drexler  who used to play  for the Portland Trailblazers.  It's always the same joke.  I'm joking.  So he's a basketball player.  He usually is, yes.  Mark the calendar  when I said this.  She will get pregnant again 
[02:37:00]  because that would make  unbelievable TV.  She needs to do something big  to get the viewers back.  I'm telling you.  Whether she's seeing someone  on the side now,  who knows?  But she'll let an oopsie go  and there you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Wow, okay.  I bank on this one.  Well.  I bank on this.  You are the seer.  I don't need Marmalade Sally  for this one.  I could do this one  on my own.  Marmalade Sally knows  what she's talking about.  Do we dim the lights again?  No, we don't have to. 
[02:37:30]  Not right now.  So much goddamn work  bringing that dumb bitch in here.  Marmalade Sally  hit some fucking home runs  and she had her finger  on the pulse  and you guys can hate  all you want.  But Marmalade Sally,  she seeth.  Seeth.  Her vagina looks like  a Picasso painting.  That's his liver.  Yeah.  That's got to look.  That's got to be a mess.  I don't care.  Oh, that's as close  as we can get  to a pussy shot.  To the baby factory? 
[02:38:00]  Let's see.  That could be a dirty job  for Mike Rowe.  Yeah.  Cleaning that fucking thing  after she sat on it.  Yuck.  Her vag leaking.  God damn.  Just eggs.  Like a fucking chicken  sat there.  She's so fertile.  Hey, omelet panties.  Get over here.  That's it.  Looks like fucking caviar.  Ew.  Josh wants to correct us.  We have our K-tod knowledge  all wrong.  All right there, Josh.  Go ahead, Josh.  Good evening.  Hello.  I'm aboard, Josh. 
[02:38:30]  I hate to rain on your parade,  but she had the fertilization  and then they had the C-section,  so nothing has probably been  in or out of that vag ever.  Oh, you're right.  Actually, she had a  fertility drug.  In vitro?  She did the C-sections.  And then a C-section?  Yeah.  Wow.  Fuck.  I'm going to kill Bobby  in his soup and match the hatch.  No one told me  I would get a fucking cold,  Bobby.  What do you think?  Standing in 55 degree  fucking river water  and it's raining on me. 
[02:39:00]  Soaking all my clothes  because I don't have  a fucking rain jacket.  Language.  So now I got a fucking cold,  Bobby.  It's my home.  Bobby.  At least I don't blow  my nose like you do.  And a bottle rocket  came out of it.  That was the best.  The other thing is,  so then  TLC does their press release.  All right, John's done.  So then John goes,  fuck that,  I don't want to get divorced.  He's trying to still  stay in there.  Oh, is he?  I forgot that part of the story.  Yikes.  Boy, do they love  their television. 
[02:39:30]  Maybe for the money  he doesn't want to get divorced.  Oh, do they love it?  The more deals she gets,  the more money he gets.  The money.  Because they're married.  But why doesn't he  say that  her future earnings  are going to be so much  because she  has the TV show  and then  he can get money  for many years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Did Woody Allen  really  demand the release 
[02:40:00]  of Roman Polanski?  A lot of celebrities  are coming out  and saying that.  They're all signing what?  Some kind of like fucking  some kind of useless document.  Petition or something.  Exactly.  Do you think Roman Polanski  is like,  look, Woody,  I can handle this  without you.  Thanks, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially if he's  getting other celebrities.  Yeah, and it's like  Woody's the last person  you want  sending a letter.  Yeah.  You know,  what did he  start fucking his  stepdaughter  when she was 14  or some shit?  Whatever the story is.  I don't know.  I don't know for sure  but it was  there were some  questionable things 
[02:40:30]  in there, right?  Martin Scorsese  comes out for him.  Well, the victim's  even coming out  for him, right?  Yeah.  She wanted the charges  dropped.  She's like,  enough.  Yeah, yeah.  She said the press  did more damage  to her than  Roman did.  I guess he's got  a little wee-wee.  I don't know  how much damage.  Roman ain't  breaking any new ground.  No, he looks  like a little guy.  Yeah.  A little Polish hog.  Yeah.  He's probably got  more girth than anything.  Yeah.  Probably tapers 
[02:41:00]  like it's a thin tip  that gets fatter  at the bottom  as will a kill boss.  And you don't want  to acknowledge  that the Red Sox  clinched the wild card there?  Why, by losing?  That's great  for your Yankee fans, though.  By losing,  they clinched it.  You get to see  the teams go out again  possibly there, right?  They couldn't even win.  It's because Texas  fucking lost assholes.  And that's the only reason  the Red Sox are there.  They lost their game  last night.  Yankees won  with a fucking  shit team.  Again? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  They won with  fucking Little League  players that are  out on the field now.  That's just bringing in...  How great would that be  for the Little League?  The Yankee organization  just gets the best  Little Leaguers  in the area  and says,  fuck it.  And all of a sudden  these little fuckers  are in Yankee uniforms  at Yankee Stadium.  It's hysterical.  Why can't they do  something like that?  It was a great  little walk-off  fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you still  watching the games  for real?  Yeah.  We watched last night.  You should take a break.  Get ready for the playoffs. 
[02:42:00]  I like seeing who's playing,  who's in.  Because they're not  playing like a lot  of the regular guys.  So I like seeing  who they got in the wings  and how they're playing.  It's pretty good.  You know how I just  mentioned the cold  because I was standing  in the river  and getting rained on?  Yeah.  A bunch of people  saying that's not  how you get cold.  But why is it then  that we're getting  colds in those situations?  Yeah.  Why does that happen?  I understand.  A cold is a virus  so you need some contact.  It's got to go up  your schnoz. 
[02:42:30]  It's got to do something.  But there is something  about cold and wet weather  that gives you  a fucking cold  or makes you more susceptible.  All right.  Technically,  technically you're not  getting the cold from...  But somehow  because of that environment  it makes it easier  to get colds.  What is that?  Who the hell is she?  Oh, that's...  She looks like a thinner version  of Scarlett Johansson.  A thinner, taller version, right?  Oh, yeah.  Who is she, Dan?  Where does she come from?  That's...  I actually know who that is.  She's Swedish.  She's a model. 
[02:43:00]  Her name is Taylor Momsen.  It's not Taylor Momsen.  No.  Can we get better pictures of her?  No, Jimmy knows who she is, Jimmy.  She's a model from Sweden.  Yeah.  Shut up, Jimmy.  She is.  What's her name?  Petra Dish.  Oh, let me see the one  all the way to the right.  Oh, I just went  all the way left.  No.  That's okay.  Any one of hers is good.  That would pop.  Oh, yes, it certainly did.  I sensed it coming.  Wow.  I think I have a new  favorite girl on the internet.  She looks like...  What's her name?  Anna Faris a little bit, too, right? 
[02:43:30]  No, not really.  A little bit.  You don't think Anna Faris is hot?  No, she's got a weird look to her.  She's cute-ish.  She's really hot.  No, straight up.  Up.  There.  Straight up what?  You want Paul Abdul?  No, ew.  I want to see that.  Look at that.  Oh, she's got long legs.  She's a gossip girl.  Is she on the Gossip Girl?  What the fuck is that show about?  Anyone know?  Yes.  I don't know,  but I'm going to start watching it.  Wait, Jimmy knows.  The Gossip Girl.  What is it about, Jim?  They just go back and forth 
[02:44:00]  and gossip.  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  Right?  Yep.  They eat feed.  Oh.  A bunch of hens.  A bunch of feed-eating bitches.  A bunch of feed.  Exactly.  I need some feed out of my hand.  Kevin from Connecticut.  He's back in our good graces.  No, I'm just kidding, Kevin.  Whatever.  I mean, we take your opinions.  You know that.  For the most part.  Opie, is she hotter than Miranda Kerr?  Anthony?  I say Miranda Kerr all the way. 
[02:44:30]  Really?  Although the last video I saw of her on TMZ  or WhatWithTylerDurtonDo.com,  close to anorexic, this Miranda Kerr.  Really?  Too many bones.  You can see too many bones in the back.  The bone looks like a bag full of antlers.  When you see a beautiful girl  and she's got a piece of the shoulder blades  maybe poking through the skin a little bit,  that's all right.  But when you start seeing other bones in that area,  it's kind of creepy, right?  Yeah.  It's been on the anorexic side.  I'm not into the bony. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, she's a little bony.  I don't care, though.  And people want to argue the cold thing.  All I know is I don't get sick  in the middle of the summer  when I'm hanging out in a field or something  or biking or whatever the fuck.  Golfing.  Golf.  You know, when I do one of these  cold winter outdoor activities,  I seem to get colds then.  Yeah.  And that's all I need to know.  Technically, I don't need to know  what is actually happening.  It's a virus.  All right.  What, that the warm weather kills,  I guess, technically?  I guess it's harder to get it colder 
[02:45:30]  in the summer.  I don't fucking know.  Sometimes we don't need  all the knowledge.  You just know what you know.  I don't know.  I know that this fucking girl  is hot as shit.  When the weather starts getting cold,  you just know you're going to get sick.  You don't think that in the summer.  You just don't.  Ooh, what a slob I am.  This girl's hot in.  God, Jesus.  Can you see her snitch?  She's only 16 in.  What?  No, how old is she?  And Jay in Jersey goes,  way to pick them.  No.  Way to pick them in.  How old is she, really? 
[02:46:00]  Go to IMDB.  How old is she?  Ooh, 15-year-old Taylor Mumps.  Shit.  Jimmy, Gossip Girls,  what's this about?  She's the hottest fucking...  Look how hot.  They just get together and chat.  What about what, though?  What do they chat about?  Oh, my God.  What are they just size queens?  Uh-oh.  They just chat about big girls.  She's so 16.  I gotta wait.  She's 16?  Look at her, though.  Shut up.  There ain't one person  that wouldn't jump all over that.  I wouldn't.  Nope.  Shut up. 
[02:46:30]  Nope.  In a second.  Nope.  In a second.  Nope.  Right, Jimmy?  Yep.  Good point.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Absolutely not.  Look how she's posing  in some of these pictures.  Nope.  Stop it.  If you go to court,  they would roast you.  She's asking for it.  That's my excuse.  She was asking for it.  You know what?  That would work so well in court.  You would be roasted  in court for that.  Oh.  Hey, look who's back today.  Should we do this for them?  What? 
[02:47:00]  Should we do this for them today?  Trying to hint.  Hold on.  Should we do this for them?  I got it.  I know.  So happy together.  We're happy together.  So happy together.  There you go.  We're happy together.  Now, quick.  Iraq, if anyone talks about that,  get us the audio.  Exactly.  Mike the bathroom,  in case somebody mentions our names  while shitting. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Where were we?  I don't want the question answered.  I'm sick,  and I'm blaming Bobby  and his match-to-hatch weekend.  That's all I need to know.  You look at that  and tell me there's a problem.  Let me see.  Which one?  Right here.  Lean up.  Look at that.  Yeah, there is a problem.  You go to jail.  What?  That's the problem.  You would go to jail  if she was a talker.  Where's that country  that you got to take  the young girls to?  Thailand's a good place to start.  No, no, no.  Bora Bora?  Fiji.  Fiji, that's right. 
[02:48:00]  I got to go to Fiji with this girl.  Fiji.  We got to go to Fiji.  Oh, Jimmy,  you got the gossip girl thing  all wrong.  Brian in the Bronx.  So glad that a guy knows  what gossip girl is about.  Yeah.  What the fuck, Brian?  Why are you watching this shit?  Oh, my girl, Monday night.  She goes through  four or eight hours of football  and, you know,  I agree to watch one hour  of this gossip girl show with her.  Yeah, what is it about?  Jimmy needs to know  because I think  Jimmy's knowledge  is a little wrong. 
[02:48:30]  What it is is like,  you know,  it's all these kids, right?  They're all about,  they just went to college now,  so, you know,  18, 19 years old  and they're all the parents,  the kids,  the children of really rich parents  down in the city  all like, you know,  billionaires, millionaires.  They all inherit  their parents' money.  Basically, all it's about  is, you know,  them living these scandalous lives.  You know,  and all they do is like,  say one of the girls  goes out with one of the other guy's  ex-girlfriends  or something like that  and they put it on his website  and it's like this big  fucking gossip thing. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know how to explain it really.  It's just...  Yeah, but obviously.  Sounds fascinating, though.  Jimmy, is that what it's about,  this gossip girl?  I don't hear a word he said.  It's not good.  All right.  You check it out for the chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all check it out  for the chicks.  Anthony.  Oh, good.  Dennis from Jersey  is making fun of me,  but I'm going to stand by my statement.  He writes,  sometimes you don't need  all the knowledge,  you just know what you know.  Nicely put, Ope, you douche.  You douche.  Sometimes that's all you need to know  is what you know. 
[02:49:30]  That's it.  Know what you know.  Right.  You know?  Oh, here we go, Ed.  Sean and George  is going to help you out  with your little dilemma.  What?  Well, he knows you need  to fuck young girls  and he's going to help you with that.  What?  I didn't say that.  I'm after this  fucking  Taylor Mumpson.  Well, there are places  it's legal  is what I'm getting at.  Yeah?  Okay.  All right.  Sean in Georgia.  Well, certain parts of Canada,  the age of consent  is only 14,  so you may only have  to take a quick trip. 
[02:50:00]  Me and Taylor Mumpson?  Wait, the age of consent  is 14 in Canada?  Did we know this?  14.  I don't know.  Probably not over  the entire fucking country.  Right.  Maybe in one of their  silly little fucking  provinces  or whatever they call them.  I don't even know.  Yeah, I am saying that,  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I am saying that.  So what you're saying is  that sometimes  the knowledge you find  on a placemat  is enough.  Yes.  Yes.  Bob Kelly's checking in there, 
[02:50:30]  Jimmy.  Bobby!  You know what, dude?  You got your gossip show.  You got your cup of coffee.  You got your thing of lube.  You rub one out.  You smoke a cigarette.  Boom!  Everyone's doing their Bob Kelly.  Bing, boom.  Yeah, you got to do the boob.  Bob Kelly,  what do you got today  for the show?  Dude,  you didn't get your call  from me, dude.  Listen,  what you got to do  is wash your hands  in hot water.  Is that it, dude? 
[02:51:00]  Dude,  a little hot water,  some soap,  you rub,  you fucking  wash the germs away.  Boom!  You're healthy.  CB wants in.  CB!  Good evening.  Hey, CB.  Good evening.  I just wanted to  congratulate you guys  on getting  Roman Polanski  on the interview.  I thought he was  in a Swiss jail  but apparently  sitting over there  by Jimmy.  Yeah,  he's right between  me and Jimmy.  Look,  I am not talking  about laws here. 
[02:51:30]  Throw the law away.  You look at this girl  and tell me  you wouldn't knock off  a piece of that shit.  And you're just being  completely dishonest  as a guy.  Yes?  I didn't hear a word  he said.  What's going on with you?  I'm looking at my photo  in Jeff Ross' book.  Oh, okay.  I'm in a book.  Why the fuck are,  we gotta get Jeff in here.  We'll go to break  and get Jeffrey Ross in?  You wanna do that?  Quick break?  Yeah.  I'm looking for my name  and the thank yous.  And if they aren't in here,  this book is sailing 
[02:52:00]  through the window.  Hell to pay.  Alright,  why don't we take  a break then?  Alrighty.  Oh, Chuck Knobloch.  Cause we were talking  about the Yankees,  ex-Yankee there.  Oh boy.  He had a bit of an OCD thing  when he came to the plate,  no?  Did he?  Yeah.  Or what do you call him,  Jimmy?  A bunch of ticks?  Chuck Knobloch?  He seems to have them.  It seems like,  you know,  he wants to choke up  on the bat  and his wife.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  He choked his wife  and smacked her?  I don't know what she did.  He's in a bit of trouble there. 
[02:52:30]  Who's that fucking guy  in the socks  with the worst goddamn  fucking batting stance?  No idea.  Oh God,  it's so sick.  Who is that?  Do you know Travis?  No?  No.  Somebody will say it  because it's got to,  it's the worst  fucking batting stance ever.  Let me see.  See if somebody got that.  No clue.  Can't remember the name.  Eucalus.  Yeah.  Kevin Eucalus.  Eucalus.  Yeah.  Look at this  motherfucking guy's  stance at the plate. 
[02:53:00]  How did a Little League coach  not tell him  stop that,  you look like an idiot?  He was hitting home runs  probably.  I don't know how he's doing this.  I ain't fixing his  batting stance.  It looks silly.  Do you remember?  Look at him.  Does he really?  Look at it.  Look at it.  What is that?  Why does he do that?  I don't know,  but it's stupid.  Doesn't it take a long time  to get that bat around? 
[02:53:30]  He does that,  and then right when  the pitcher delivers,  he steps forward  and gets into a regular stance.  But beforehand,  he's holding it like  Conan holds his sword.  I'll run you through.  What a great observation.  It's like,  stop doing that!  Kevin Euclid is now  coming in line.  What about Felix Mion?  Did he have a funny one?  He used only half the bat.  That's Felix Mion.  Tim Tuffel had a funny one, too.  Tim Tuffel was a little weird.  He would shake his ass.  Yeah.  Just sexy.  That's what you want to see. 
[02:54:00]  And Boog Powell,  did he have a bad bat?  Boog, Boog Powell!  Did he have a bad  batting stance?  Wow.  That's some old school shit,  right?  Horrible.  I have no idea.  Tim Tuffel.  Remember Tim Tuffel?  He did the Tuffel Shuffle.  The Tuffel Shuffle, yes.  Mickey Rivers.  The Tuffel Shuffle.  Mickey Rivers.  What about Rod Carew  just slapping?  Slapping singles  all day long.  All day long.  All day long.  Tuffel Shuffle.  We're babbling.  Let's get Jeffrey Ross in here. 
[02:54:30]  You want to take a break  or you want to  just get him in right now?  I don't feel good.  Okay.  I'm going to go home.  You guys could do  Jeffrey Ross.  That's easy.  What?  You'll have fun with him.  But if you go home,  I have to leave.  No.  I'll miss you.  Certainly not going to be here  tomorrow for Kevin Smith  because I really feel like  this is taking hold.  But I...  Hopefully he'll be back  Friday though.  Let's take a break  so I can just look at  more Taylor Momsen pictures.  Girl of the day  right there.  She is... 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  O&A.  Hey, this is  Victoria Gotti.  You're listening to  my pal,  Little Jimmy Norton.  A lot of guests today.  Actually,  friends.  Friends stopping by.  Yes.  And we made a new one  with Victoria Gotti.  My brother still  hasn't written me back.  No?  I think he's in a panic. 
[02:55:30]  You're trying to find  shepherd's pie.  Yeah.  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey Russell's studio.  So Victoria Gotti's in here, right?  She's doing a book signing  in Huntington, New York  where my brother's restaurant is.  Yeah.  I mean, it is  a quarter mile away  from the bookstore,  the review where she's doing  a signing for a book.  So stupid me goes,  hey, why don't you stop  by my brother's restaurant  for some dinner?  She goes, you have shepherd's pie?  And I panicked and said, yeah.  He's never made a shepherd's pie  in his life.  Wow.  So now there's a whole panic  going on at the restaurant.  You just completely lied.  Yeah, I did. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  And then she's like,  and I'm like,  you're not going to stop  by the restaurant.  That's crazy.  She goes, don't be surprised.  This Saturday night  when I walk through  the front door,  I'm like,  interesting.  Oh, fuck.  You're in touch.  She'll be signing books  with marinara sauce.  Yeah.  That's great.  What are you looking at there, Jimmy?  There's a great picture  of Gene with his boots  the night we roasted him.  Oh, Gene Simmons.  The Gene Simmons roast was...  Jeff said, let's face it,  Gene Simmons is such an asshole  that his own asshole  changed his name to Murray.  That's very funny, man.  That's very funny.  Gene to me is like  Ace Freelie to Jim Norton. 
[02:56:30]  I love Gene too, though,  but I...  Really?  Yeah, I kind of prefer Ace.  Ace is the place.  But I love Paul too.  Then again, Peter.  I love him all.  It's a tricky thing,  but the whole idea is,  you know,  you're heroes,  and I tried to put  as many heroes  in the book  who I've roasted,  and obviously,  there's a great picture  of me and Jim  in our trip to Guantanamo Bay.  Yeah.  All right.  To entertain the soldiers  stuck down there.  Well, what's the book about?  It's obviously  all the roasts  you've done over the years,  but you go inside  some of this?  It's more of a philosophy book  on roasting  because, you know, 
[02:57:00]  this is like  almost a religion to me,  so my tricks of the trade  for writing jokes,  for making fun  of your friends and family,  all my life  and roast philosophies  are in there  and about having thick skin  and how I got there,  and hopefully,  some young,  funny people  will read it  and also learn  how to roast.  You brought the roast back.  You know that.  I do.  We have you to thank for that.  I want to keep  the tradition alive.  It'll die  if it stays  with this generation.  You know,  we've made it cool again  and now we need  young people 
[02:57:30]  to meet us  on the big dais one day.  You know what?  You become so synonymous  with the roast  that you can pretty much  say anything  without really  pissing off people,  but obviously,  your first few roasts,  you know,  people didn't know you.  They know you now.  They go,  oh, it's Jeffrey Ross.  There were repercussions  back then.  Were there early on?  Oh, yeah, man.  Give me an example  of something you said  that somebody  really got pissed at.  Well, now I can get away with it.  I can make fun of people 
[02:58:00]  who aren't there,  but in the beginning,  you know,  roasting's all about  making fun of someone  to their face,  not pranking somebody,  but, you know,  an honest insult  right to their face.  And I was roasting  Rob Reiner,  great director,  and I said,  I don't know  how to roast you.  I mean,  how do you even embarrass  a guy who married  Penny Marshall?  What was your wedding song?  How much is that  doggy in the window?  Oh, fuck.  That was great,  you know,  big laughs,  you know.  I remember this, yeah.  And a couple months later,  I'm in Las Vegas  roasting the owners 
[02:58:30]  of the Palm Casino,  the Maloof Brothers,  and it gets to me,  and Penny Marshall's  in the front row,  whacked out of her mind,  drinking,  having a good time,  and as I'm being introduced,  she starts shouting me down,  like I'm the president,  and she's that senator,  like,  you lie.  She's like,  don't laugh at him.  He's mean.  He's a jerk.  Don't laugh.  And she's getting louder  and louder,  pulling all the focus,  and I don't know what to do.  I'm like,  I worked weeks on my jokes,  you know,  I don't just wing it. 
[02:59:00]  I've got material here,  and she's interrupting me,  and she's getting closer  and closer and closer  to like grabbing the mic  and completely ruining my set,  and I just needed like an A-bomb  to shut her up.  I said,  which one were you again?  Lenny or Squiggy.  Oh, fuck.  Why would she take you on?  That's so dumb.  I didn't have the rep.  Did you get a big laugh?  Oh, yeah.  And she sat down.  Of course she did.  She knew at that point  she was in overhead.  Now I have a little bit more  of a license to kill,  but back then it was tricky.  Yeah.  Yeah, now it's, 
[02:59:30]  I mean, you know,  it's an honor.  But one of the,  thank you,  one of the chapters  is about how a roast master  must know some self-defense  because it does give you  the swagger  and the confidence  to talk shit.  Oh, yeah.  And you are,  you're the target also.  There's the person  you're roasting,  but the roast master  is also the target  of the people  up there on the dais.  Obviously some of the  greatest moments happen  when you sort of  just take a left hook  to somebody  who doesn't expect it.  Yeah, that's true.  You know,  you're just up there  roasting away Jerry Stiller 
[03:00:00]  and suddenly it's,  I wouldn't fuck you  with Bea Arthur's dick.  Yeah.  And, you know,  suddenly she's in the game  and the same thing  happened, you know,  with Courtney Love  and I tell a story  about my crazy sexual escapades  with Bea Arthur in the book.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sounds hot.  I might not have been  molested by my dad  like Mackenzie Phillips,  but I was raped  by Bea Arthur.  You don't see me  whining about it  on Oprah?  Oh, that Mackenzie Phillips.  Jesus Christ.  Bea Arthur held me down  while Courtney Love  beat the shit out of me. 
[03:00:30]  Who was,  who was like a pain  in the ass  to write material about?  Like, who was like  the hardest person?  You know,  I don't know.  I mean,  pain in the ass  to write material about.  You know,  you have to tiptoe  with some people  a little bit,  but I usually go for it.  I don't know.  Oh, I know you go for it.  I'm just saying  some people,  it must just like  come right out  of your fucking hand  and just,  you know,  it's easy to write  about certain celebrities.  I mean,  they almost make jokes  of themselves  just walking around.  But others,  you know, 
[03:01:00]  it's got to be  a little harder  to write for  certain other celebrities.  I guess that's a good point.  The trick,  the trick,  Anthony,  is,  you know,  to try to find an angle.  Like,  we rose to Joan Rivers,  which you'd think  would be a field day.  Yeah.  But when you're going on  late in the lineup  and there's like  all these people  making the same jokes,  you have to find  a unique angle  or you have to be  meaner and harder  than everybody else.  You have to have  like five jokes  for everything  because it's going  to get stepped on.  How many times  can you say,  you know,  she has a big knowledge.  It's like,  all right,  it's been said already.  Well,  Donald Trump's hair,  that was the big one  during the Donald Trump roast. 
[03:01:30]  It was just nothing  but hair jokes.  Yeah,  how many,  towards the end of it,  you're just like,  yeah,  we get it.  I don't want to move on  from Joan Rivers  because there was  a lot of controversy there  because she basically said  don't go after Melissa.  Interesting.  Which,  that was very interesting  because she's  old school comic  and she understands  how this game works  and for her to say that,  I lost a lot of respect  for her.  And Jimmy's a big fan.  I do like her,  but,  you know,  I think your freaking daughter  can handle a few jokes  at a roast.  You would think.  And I remember 
[03:02:00]  getting a call,  you know,  not a call like that,  like they tell us  what to do,  but they do say  these are sensitive areas  sometimes.  Oh,  really?  You know,  Joan Rivers,  I mean,  she's been busting people  for 40 years.  I mean,  we're roasting her  vicariously,  I felt like,  for everyone.  One of the biggest  ball busters  in the history of comedy.  I said,  Joan Rivers is so old,  if you Google her,  you can find her  on Craig's  and Schindler's list.  And she was taking it  really well,  but Melissa,  I remember her, 
[03:02:30]  you know,  kind of coming up  to me in the makeup chair  and just be like,  are you going to take it  easy on me,  right?  And, you know,  just laughing.  Oh,  don't worry,  don't worry,  don't worry.  Yeah.  I said,  how's your mom?  Oh,  she's ready,  she's ready.  It was all very light.  And then they said,  you know,  like you can make,  you know,  lay off Melissa  because she's not going to,  she's not the one  being roasted.  So we get up there  and that's not how  roasts go.  I've been waiting for Greg  to tell his story,  Geraldo,  but he hasn't told it,  so I'm going to tell it.  Good.  Good,  yeah,  tell it.  Because that really  bothered us. 
[03:03:00]  You know,  these roast,  you know,  philosophies,  they really,  like I love this stuff,  like more than anything,  because once you're there,  you should be fair game,  you know?  You have to spread the love,  but I remember Geraldo  went up and he does  the lead off spot,  sets the tone,  and always goes  just a little harder  than everybody else,  in my opinion,  and really,  like,  breaks it open.  It's like,  he doesn't,  like,  push it open,  he kicks it open.  And that's part of  being the first guy,  you know?  It's not easy.  So he does whatever jokes 
[03:03:30]  he does about Melissa Rivers.  I guess somebody can look him up,  I can't remember,  but he went there.  It wasn't particularly cruel,  just a couple of shots,  and then he moved on,  and then they go  to commercial break,  and Geraldo,  you know,  he's got his leather jacket on,  he's always sweating afterwards,  and he sits down,  and we're on an elevated dais,  and Melissa Rivers  is wearing a really tight,  tight, tight dress,  and she comes,  like,  wobbling up to the edge  of the podium,  and she looks up at him,  and she goes,  pointing at him,  and she goes,  you knew the rules,  you knew the rules,  and he's like,  what? 
[03:04:00]  Rules?  Rules.  Stop,  rules.  She's really sensitive,  huh?  She can't think of it.  She's just crazy.  And to her credit,  she went up later,  she was funny,  she really killed,  I feel like I helped  talk her into performing,  she didn't even want to perform.  Oh, really?  And in the end,  obviously,  Joan Rivers went up  and schooled everybody.  I heard she fucking  just destroyed everyone.  She ripped the roof  off the place.  I've never seen  a guest of honor  ripped the way  Joan Rivers ripped.  I mean,  she was really,  really funny,  and to her credit, 
[03:04:30]  she always,  she went for it.  I don't know,  she was really brutal.  Everything from,  she just,  I don't even know,  I remember she just  ripped Robin Quivers,  every single person  she just destroyed.  It was probably  the greatest closing  to a roast  I'd ever seen.  Wow.  Awesome.  It's important to get  a guest of honor  that has thick skin  and can go up there  and give a little  payback at the end.  Who was the worst?  The worst?  After taking all the jokes  all night,  now it's their opportunity. 
[03:05:00]  Who was the worst?  Donald Trump,  we were at that one.  Was there someone  worse than Donald Trump?  Flava Flav  kind of fell apart  at the end of his roast.  He sure did.  I came out and I said,  how do you embarrass  a crackhead  who wears a Viking helmet?  It's hilarious.  Just another example  of making fun  of somebody  who's not there  and it haunting me  because I said,  Flav,  I don't watch your show.  If I want to watch  a midget bang  a bunch of hookers,  I'll go to a party  at Jeremy Piven's house  and like three years later  I hear that he was 
[03:05:30]  pissed at me.  Fuck him.  It comes with the territory.  Yeah.  Who was pissed at you?  Piven.  Piven.  Oh yeah.  It's nice to know  that Piven  could be pissed at you.  That's a nice spot  in entertainment there.  I heard Chevy Chase  didn't take it well.  I didn't do that one  because I didn't feel  like he'd be a good sport.  I don't know.  I didn't get the sense.  Yeah, I didn't think  he was either.  Something happened there.  I remember watching that  and being like,  wow, he just doesn't seem happy.  It was chopped,  I remember.  The edits in that one  were horrible,  especially when he got up 
[03:06:00]  there at the end  because they didn't know  what to do with his set.  I remember Geraldo  telling me afterwards,  I go, well,  what did he say to you  before the roast?  And he goes,  I didn't meet him before.  I go, well,  that doesn't make any sense.  You got to shake  a guy's hand,  look him in the eyes  before you call him names.  You know?  To me, it's all like  good roasts  are the extensions  of good friendships.  If everybody feels  comfortable,  rat packy,  you know,  protected,  then it's going to be  a great show.  Those are the best shows.  One of the things  I talk about in the book  is breaking down  the recipe for a roast. 
[03:06:30]  It shouldn't just be  celebrities on a dais anymore.  More and more,  I'm talking to people  who are throwing roasts  in their office,  in their backyard,  their buddies,  for special occasions.  To me,  that's the future  of roasting  is taking it off  famous people  in tuxedos  and all that  and making it  a homey,  fun thing  that you do  with your pals.  I'd love to see  some of those,  though.  I bet there's  some real bombs  in there.  Hey, man,  I heard your wife.  It's just a joke.  I heard your wife 
[03:07:00]  fucked a bunch  of blacks  in my school.  But that shit  would kill.  Of course it does.  Because it's true.  They better read  your book, Jeffrey.  Yeah, you know,  you got to  prepare.  You can't go up  and wing it.  There's nothing  more annoying  than somebody  who goes up  and tries to wing it.  Of course.  It's insulting  to the guys  who prepare.  Like, what,  you think you're  funnier off the cuff  than we are prepared?  Just gonna riff.  A good roast  sometimes will take me weeks.  Like, Joan Rivers,  I had a month's preparation. 
[03:07:30]  I hung up pictures  of her all over my house  so I could become,  you know,  familiarized with  how uniquely  disgusting looking she is.  You know who did  the best off the cuff  roast response?  Because he didn't know  he was going to be roasted.  We roasted Colin one time.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, but you had that with me,  I think,  at that party for Colin,  we went up and roasted him  a little bit  and he went on  and did a half hour  and fucking destroyed  all of us.  You know who was...  He killed Seinfeld,  he killed Geraldo,  he killed me,  he killed...  And Seinfeld went up  and he was... 
[03:08:00]  Where was this?  In a basement.  Yeah, this was like  his bachelor party.  Yes, bachelor party.  It was like,  he had a roast  for his bachelor party  and Seinfeld showed up  and Seinfeld did some time  and...  Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah.  You know,  roasting isn't for everybody  and you have to prepare  and...  But Colin,  the point is,  Colin went up and...  He murdered all of us.  Destroyed, yeah.  It was really funny.  Colin's a different type of animal.  Colin can improvise  funnier than most people can write,  you know.  His two minutes preparation  is better than most people's two weeks. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  I talk about going to visit  the wounded guys  at Walter Reed  with Colin my first time,  you know,  and, you know,  like,  it's really tricky,  you know,  and I didn't know  how to go about it,  you know,  what the protocol is  and it's all Marines,  you know,  these guys are badasses  and Colin walks in the room  ahead of me  and he gets down on one knee  in front of the guy's bed  like he's going to,  like,  pray or tell him some secret,  you know,  in the Marines' linen  and Colin gets right in his ear  and he goes,  all right,  two fags are sitting around 
[03:09:00]  the apartment.  I can't tell it as well  as Colin,  but he's like,  oh, yeah, yeah,  the guys were dying  and he goes,  one fag is like,  I'm bored.  If you blow me,  if you,  let's play hide and seek.  If you find me,  you can blow me.  What if I don't find you?  I'll be behind the couch.  The guy's laughing through a tube.  It's like the greatest moment ever. 
[03:09:30]  Colin has a certain flair  for uneasy situations.  He certainly does.  Are you still part of  Dancing with the Stars?  They'll have me on now  on the season finales  to roast the finalists,  which is really fun.  You're going to have  that spot this year?  I haven't gotten  the official call  and they're kind of damned  if they do  and damned if they don't,  but to their credit,  they're the only reality show  with a sense of humor  about itself.  They had me on the other day  to do a little spritzing.  So, you know,  once you're part of that cult,  you're in.  It's kind of neat  that you're in that world, right? 
[03:10:00]  It doesn't hurt you.  This season's cast,  they should call Dancing  with the Vaguely Familiar.  You see our friend,  Chuck Liddell?  He's doing great.  Oh, my God.  It's so funny to watch, though.  I thought it was a telethon.  I sent $400.  We've seen it a few times  now on the show.  Oh, he's...  And Kelly Osbourne.  She's doing really well.  I took a peek the other day  and Sharon's all nervous  in the audience,  clapping like a retard. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Just panicking and stuff.  Hey, EZ,  you're talking about  one of Jimmy's...  Oh, sorry.  I sent Sharon an email  congratulating her  on Kelly's doing a great job.  She's doing great.  Are you dead?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's Chuck Liddell.  Chuck Liddell.  By the way,  we would never tell  Chuck Liddell to his face.  That he looked ridiculous.  No, no.  Watching Chuck try to smile  is hilarious.  Yeah, there's this...  He goes like...  He's watching a turtle  breakdance.  It reminds me of  Young Frankenstein  when they do  the Ritz crackers.  Yes, that's where we went.  We went with that, too. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  You know Liddell's  going to be in studio  if he continues.  We will end up  having him in here  and we're going to have to...  Oh, you've got to get him.  Are you seeing him dancing  for the second weekend?  This isn't practicing.  It's the counting  that fucks him up.  And one, and two.  And he's like...  He's never gotten past two.  This is the second dance  or the first?  I think this is the...  Oh, this is the first one?  Look at this.  Who's the second one?  Oh, yeah.  This is the first guy.  This is a stupid hat.  You've got to watch him slide 
[03:11:30]  and try to be charming.  His slide is hysterical.  I swear to God,  it looks like a rape to music.  Look at the slide.  His shoe kind of caught.  And that was the good one.  There's another slide  that goes so awry.  We didn't do this to you,  Jeffrey Ross, last year.  Don't worry.  Yeah, no, it's okay.  And when he tries to smile...  I want to see if I can see Dana laughing.  Look at him trying to smile. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, the Dana part's coming up.  Honestly, if you can see Dana  laughing his ass off  across the floor again.  There's another slide.  He looks like the police commissioner.  He looks like Ray Kelly.  Yeah, he does.  It's hard for me to criticize  other people's dancing  after what I went through.  You could criticize...  You got a bad break.  There he is.  Laughing his ass off.  Is that Tito, too?  I can't see for this thing.  It was Tito, though?  I couldn't see. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, that's great.  Hey, is your partner in this season?  Yeah, she got eliminated  on the first day  with Hamilton,  Ashley Hamilton.  All right, Hamilton.  She's having a couple  of bad years, huh?  I think one of the longest  chapters in the book  is my heartbreaking experience  on Dancing with the Stars  because it really did affect me  for a long time.  Did it really?  I got cut on the first day.  I got a lower score  than anyone.  I got a lower score  than when Heather Mills'  leg flew off.  Almost killed a cameraman.  I got a lower score 
[03:13:00]  than...  Remember the first season  when Larry Flint  did a wheelie  flew out of his chair?  He got a higher score  than me.  It was embarrassing,  but I did dig up  some good pictures  of my partner  and I edit  rehearsing and stuff.  You were into her, man.  Yeah, she was a good...  She was a good person.  She still is.  Did you feel like  you had a chance  even though she was  taken?  No.  Well, you know,  it was a different  kind of thing.  You have a connection,  but it's not  a romantic connection.  She hasn't emailed you  lately, huh?  She called me  for my birthday, actually.  Oh, yeah, that's good.  No, we stayed friends.  She's a very good person 
[03:13:30]  and I was hoping  she'd do well this season.  You had the fucking eye injury.  She poked me in the eye.  Ugh.  Yeah, a little  poked in the eye.  Scratched cornea.  Oh, wow.  Got the worst score  possible.  Look at Chuck.  Chuck Liddell.  This is the second one?  He is a madman.  Oh, I like the song.  They're like  no more smiling.  Yeah.  He's walking like  he's got a stick 
[03:14:00]  up his ass, though.  Way to ruin  the White Stripes song,  by the way.  Jesus.  He looks like  he's going to punch her.  Yes.  Is that his tattoo  for real?  I don't know.  I think they added  that one, though.  It's coming from my  eyes, says David Lloyd. 
[03:14:30]  He's flipping his legs  around now.  He is a bit stiff.  He's going to stay  in there for a while.  Holy shit.  Cloris Leachman.  Yeah, Jeffrey  showing us a picture  of him and Cloris  Leachman from the book.  She did  on a drunk  wrap party  one day after the show,  laid her head  down on my lap  and put my hand  on her breast.  Wow.  And squeezed it.  And she said, 
[03:15:00]  I love you, Jeff.  Do you love me?  How was her breast  feel like?  It felt good  for an 80-year-old.  Wow.  She did.  She's still got  something going on.  I don't know.  She's still having sex.  Then she strapped  on her Oscar  and banged me  in the ass.  No, I think  she is still  kind of doing it.  Whatever she wants.  She's got a lot  of spunk.  James in Chicago  wants to talk  to Jeffrey Ross.  James, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Jeff, love you, man.  Love your roasting  and all that.  Thanks.  I do have a question,  though. 
[03:15:30]  A few weeks ago,  Ron Bennett  was talking about roast  and he said  that is the worst  form of comedy.  Now, I do not  agree with that.  I think it's fine.  I just want to know  what you guys  think about it.  The worst form of comedy?  Why?  Why did he say that?  He was saying it  because one of his  regular callers,  I forgot his name,  he was going to  have a party  and he wanted guys  to roast him  and then he decided  to go against it  because he didn't want  his family made fun of  or something like that.  And then Ron just said 
[03:16:00]  he thinks it's  the worst form of comedy.  But why?  He never explained why?  It's not the easiest.  He just said  it's the worst form  of comedy.  Everyone looks stupid  up there.  I forgot exactly  the words,  but that was his words  exactly.  It was the worst form  of comedy.  What's the rule,  the general rule  of a roast?  Because I know  there are kind of  some kind of  imaginary boundaries,  right?  It's got to be...  Listen, you want  everyone to leave  the roast going,  that was so much fun, 
[03:16:30]  I hope they roast  me next time.  It's got to be a party.  It's not a sporting event.  I've been to a couple  of these roasts  where people go,  oh, wow.  I don't have an example,  unfortunately,  but wow, that was too far.  And I was confused  because I didn't know  much about the roast.  Now, wouldn't you rather  have people saying  that was too far  as opposed to going,  eh, they let them off easy,  that was boring.  But they meant it like  that probably shouldn't  have been said  type of too far.  Listen, you know,  I mean...  I mean, where is there a line?  The key is to roast  a good sport.  If you're with your friends, 
[03:17:00]  anything goes.  How could you go too far  if the three of you  were doing a roast?  If it's a connection  like that,  then it can't be too far.  You don't want to  humiliate the guy.  You want to make fun of him  and make him...  But you don't want to  actually like for real  humiliate him.  You can't roast somebody  who can be humiliated.  The trick is to find  somebody who is a made man  who has nothing to lose  or a woman.  And that leads  to my next point.  I think that's one  of the problems  with some of the roasts  that some of the people  that are involved  don't really have  a connection with this guy.  So it takes... 
[03:17:30]  You know what I mean?  So there isn't a  we're all friends here  making fun of each other.  And maybe those sections  don't go as well.  And that's the people  putting them together  because they're like,  no, we really need  this big star.  And you,  which knows this,  would go,  no,  because we don't know him.  He doesn't know us.  That's not how  these things work.  I've turned roasts down  because I didn't think...  I remember once  they wanted to roast  Mike Tyson.  Fuck.  He should have done that.  Awesome target for a roast.  I mean,  this is a great,  great,  you know, 
[03:18:00]  source of material.  But because he's like  a convicted rapist  and a part-time cannibal,  I'm like,  I can't respect this guy.  When I roast somebody,  I dig into them for weeks  and I think about them  for weeks  and I just didn't think  he deserved it.  So,  you know,  the real key  is to find somebody  who's employee of the month,  teacher of the year,  fuck face of the century,  somebody who deserves it,  who's on a special occasion.  Not just some random asshole.  That's the key. 
[03:18:30]  Roasting,  you know,  the guy says  it's the worst kind of...  I don't even know  what that means.  To me,  it's not for everybody.  I admit that.  Roasting is like  a specialized thing.  It's not for the general public.  It's underground  and that's how it should be,  you know?  It's comics.  I think the best thing  is when you're making  other comedians laugh,  it's really not easy to do  because if you do something  that's only going to make  the audience laugh  and you do some of that  audience shit  the other comics  want to spit on you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the key is to...  That's why a lot of times  the audience will go,  oh, but the other comedians 
[03:19:00]  are fucking howling  as you're brutalizing  all your friends.  Perfect example is  the Hugh Hefner roast  right after 9-11,  which I go way into depth  into one of the chapters.  Gilbert Gottfried  went too far  and the audience  was a little bit  like taken aback,  but the comics  were falling on the floor  and that helped put  Gilbert over the top.  It gave him the confidence.  He did a joke about...  It was three weeks  after 9-11.  He did a joke about  his plane having a connection  at the Empire State Building  on the way home.  Is somebody out too soon?  Too soon? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we were...  Were we at that, Rose?  Uh, I don't...  No, I don't think so.  If the joke was legendary,  he had a connection  at the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  That's...  Holy shit.  And yeah, you know,  to some guy in the third row,  that's too far.  And where we sit,  as far as the radio show,  I do remember we discussed that  because a lot of people  called the next day.  Yeah.  Like, whoa, man,  what did you guys think?  Yeah.  You know?  You know, sometimes it takes...  Well, Gilbert Gottfried  is also a good example of... 
[03:20:00]  You know, we wouldn't know  where the line was  if we didn't have Gilbert.  You kind of need  someone out there.  There's only a couple people  who will push it like that.  Yeah.  And he's one of them.  And he did it at a time  where the World Trade Center  is still smoldering  three miles downtown  and there was a lot of tension.  And the idea that we're going  to have a roast  for Hugh Hefner,  who is the main reason  the terrorists hate us  in the first place,  and then have him go up there  and we canceled the after party.  We made it a fundraiser.  We raised half a million bucks 
[03:20:30]  for the Twin Towers fund.  This is three weeks  after 9-11.  Nobody knew what  any of it meant.  Yeah, yeah.  9-24, basically.  9-24, 25 was the roast  and there's pictures of it  in the book  and some of the best jokes  from that night.  But one of the great moments  was like Gilbert  doing this joke,  people yelling  too soon, too soon,  and him like holding the podium  for a full minute  while people heckled,  didn't say a word,  almost like riding it  like a time machine  like he wished  he hadn't said it.  And that's when he launched  into the great aristocrat's joke 
[03:21:00]  as a saver.  I mean, he didn't know  where else to go  at that point  so he went to the most vulgar place  in the depths  of his scrotum  and did this incredible rendition  of this old joke  that eventually became  a famous documentary.  So wait, the joke bombed  when he did it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know,  a few of the comics  were like, whoa,  we were more impressed  that he had the chutzpah  to do it.  Yeah, I want to set up balls.  Do we have that?  If someone could find it  down the hall,  that would be great.  Oh, yeah.  And then he did the aristocrats.  I recount in the book  like step for step 
[03:21:30]  of that roast.  Like, Jimmy Kimmel  was the roast master.  He did a great job  setting the tone  and then Rob Schneider went on.  And Rob was funny.  He had some good stuff  but like he did a,  started getting into  a little bit of a run  that didn't work.  And I was producing the event.  I got nervous.  If this still starts to crash,  it's going to be  the worst roast ever.  9-11, oh my God.  So he does like three jokes  in a row that don't work  and I went up to the mic  and I usually don't interrupt people  but he was really struggling  and I put my arm around him  and I said,  Rob, hasn't there been  enough bombing in this city? 
[03:22:00]  Oh, God.  And you just felt like  the tension sort of released  and it kind of opened it up  for, you know,  Artie Lang and Drew Carey  and Sarah Silverman  and Dick Gregory  and Cedric the Entertainer  and it was just a great,  great special night  and to me,  it was probably  the greatest roast in history.  Wow.  Yeah, I remember,  I think later on that night,  Rob Schneider took off  with one of Hef's girls  or something.  Yeah, there's a picture  of her in the book.  Yeah, yeah.  She's super hot.  Yeah, that was a big scandal.  Big scandal.  Someone got fired. 
[03:22:30]  You were there.  I was at that party.  Yeah, I was at that.  Yeah, that was a fun one.  Yeah.  And Ice-T took all the roasters  out to a strip club  because we didn't have  an after party  because, you know,  it was a benefit for her.  Sure.  Yeah.  So I remember Ice-T  just, you know,  dropping a couple grand  on lap dances  and we all felt like  we did some good  for humanity.  I saw online prior,  they roasted him after,  I think that's his NBC special  was ending four episodes  and you see a little bit  of the roasts  and then at the end,  I think it was funny  when he roasted himself.  Oh, don't be fresh. 
[03:23:00]  That was more of a barbecue.  True.  But Richard goes up  and fucking,  he really,  he's not prepared  and he just  shits on everybody  and it's fucking,  you can see that he's like  just thinking  and he's so relaxed  and he just fucking  brutalizes everybody  up there.  Really?  And it's like that,  he's just a purely  funny guy  to fucking brutalize  everybody  completely off the cuff.  I don't want to lose  this caller  because I don't want,  the Ron Benning thing,  that's not cool for Ronnie  because, you know,  that caller  didn't explain himself 
[03:23:30]  and I think this guy  knows more about  what Ron was trying  to say about roasting  or roasts.  Marilyn,  I don't have your name.  What's up?  James, hey yo, man.  What's up, buddy, man?  Love your show, buddy.  Yeah, he was talking  about Fez  and you know Fez  is, you know,  got some challenges  and Fez's mom and dad  were having an anniversary  in Florida  and some guy emailed Ronnie  about Fez's alter egos  and he used all these  dick jokes 
[03:24:00]  to describe Fez  like the sphincter helmet  and a few other things  and they used it  on a best of  a week or two ago  when they were  on a vacation  but yeah,  Fez kind of melted down  like he does  and got a little emotional  and so  I guess Ronnie,  you know,  because Fez has been  having some challenges  a lot lately  you know,  he kind of just wanted  to make the guy  feel a little better.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  So, yeah,  I would imagine Ron  would appreciate it.  Of course he would.  They're brutal.  Yeah, sure. 
[03:24:30]  All right, thank you, sir.  It was funny.  It was funny.  And like I said,  you could probably  pull the clip  but yeah,  it was Fez's  mom and dad's  anniversary  in the last  six months to a year.  All right,  right on.  Thank you, sir.  Mongo the Trucker  has a question  for Jeffrey Ross  talking about his new book.  What's the name  of the book again  there, Jeffrey?  I Only Roast  the Ones I Love.  There you go.  How to Bust Balls  Without Burning Bridges.  Mongo.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Did you ever watch  some of the old  Dean Martin roast  and did you learn  how much did you learn 
[03:25:00]  from them  and how do they  compare to what  you guys do today?  It's an interesting  question.  When I got asked  to do my first roast  I had never seen one.  This was before  YouTube and stuff.  I had to go up  to the Museum of Broadcasting  and look at Dean Martin.  Jeez.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.  What year was that?  95.  You didn't know what...  Come on.  Well, I lived in New Jersey.  What do I know  from roasting?  Well, we're all  about the same age.  Growing up,  you didn't see  the Dean Martin roast?  Yeah, you saw  a second of it  as a kid  but I mean  I'm going to do it. 
[03:25:30]  Right, right.  With Milton Berle  and Henny Youngman  and Buddy Hackett  are all going to be  on a dais.  I couldn't show up.  I knew that I'd be  walking into  the Yankee Stadium  for comedy.  So you checked it out?  I went up  and I watched  a bunch of the  Dean Martin roast  and I just saw  kind of like  where the line is  and how to be  respectful  and backhanded compliments  and it was interesting  because Milton Berle  was the roast master  but we were roasting  Steven Seagal  who, you know,  I mean,  I only roast the ones  I love  didn't apply here yet  because, you know, 
[03:26:00]  his movie  Under Siege 2  Deep Impact  had just been released  but I figured  if the old guys  are going to be there  I can get behind that,  you know,  and Milton Berle  introduced me.  I had my one good suit on.  It's like 1,200 people  at the New York Hilton  and I didn't know anyone.  No one knows me.  I come out there.  I look at Seagal  and I take a big gulp.  I said,  I realize a lot  of you don't know me  but I feel uniquely qualified  to be here today  because I'm also  a shitty actor.  All right,  that's good.  And Milton, 
[03:26:30]  like, you know,  Milton,  as I'm getting on a roll,  Berle is standing  right next to me  and no one can see  under the podium  his long fingers.  Every time I got  a big laugh,  boom,  he would poke me  in the ribs.  Boom.  And I would fritch  and the audience thinks  I have some kind of  tick or something,  you know?  That was his penis  by the way.  Which I did see  eventually by the way.  Was it big?  Oh my God.  Hold on,  hold on.  After you tell your story.  So he keeps poking me,  poking me,  and finally I'm like,  what the fuck  are you doing, 
[03:27:00]  old man?  And I start getting  into like a riff with him.  So now here I am,  like,  holding my own  with the legends,  you know?  I was like,  you never know  what you're going to see  in New York.  I was walking around  downtown today.  I saw Milton Berle  in an antique shop,  800 bucks.  And he just starts  coming back at me  and finally from like  30 feet down the dais,  off mic,  just yells out  of the corner of his mouth,  Buddy Hackett goes,  hey Milton,  let the kid work,  remember when you used to?  And Milton goes running  down the dais,  kisses Buddy Hackett  on the lips. 
[03:27:30]  I go,  give it up for Milton  and Buddy.  Between the two of them  they have over 85 years  of homosexual experience.  Milton comes running back,  kisses me,  I have a picture of it  in the book,  and it was like,  I did it.  I got through the show,  didn't embarrass myself,  got some big laughs.  My first roast  was Milton Berle's  last roast.  Wow.  Jeez.  Interesting.  Milton Berle,  fucking legend.  Where'd you see the cock?  Yeah,  let's get into the cock.  As Milton got older,  as Milton got older,  his balls hung more? 
[03:28:00]  He would hang out  at the Friars Club  in Beverly Hills.  And, you know,  I'd sit and eat lunch with him,  he'd turn me on his cigars,  he would teach me about comedy,  he was very generous  with his time  and his experience,  and, you know,  he had this legendary penis,  everyone said it was  the biggest one in the world,  in show business,  and his whole joke was,  you know,  you want to have a contest,  I'll take out just enough  to beat you, you know?  So, that was his thing.  It was,  so, he was getting up there  and he goes,  help me to the men's room, 
[03:28:30]  because he could barely walk.  And, uh,  and he,  you know,  I give him my arm  and we walk to the men's room  and, you know,  it's very odd,  it's this weird,  homoerotic,  Milton Berle experience,  but it's also like,  I know that,  you know,  he doesn't show it to anyone  and if he's gonna let me,  he wants me to know  to tell,  to pass it on  that he did.  He's that crazy.  Holy shit.  And, uh,  he's peeing  and he's, you know,  he's in his 90s at this point, 
[03:29:00]  but he's still tall  and he wears a raincoat  with the cigar,  I mean,  you can picture him  and he,  he unzips it  and you can see like,  when he unzips it,  like one shoulder  goes down a long way.  Like,  it's got a lot of,  and I also have to pee  so I'm at the urinal  next to him  and he does like a little,  like 10 or 15% turn  towards me,  just a slight,  slight,  slight turn  and I,  you know,  he knows I'm gonna pee  so one eye goes,  and he doesn't even look at me,  he's got the cigar  hanging in his mouth,  he goes,  believe the hype. 
[03:29:30]  Was it fucking huge?  It was like,  I think I saw  about three quarters of it  and I turned away,  I got scared.  Yes,  it was huge.  Months later,  he's in a wheelchair  and I'm at a birthday party  performing Sid Caesar's  like 75th birthday party  or something  and I see Milton  in the audience  and I introduce Milton  and I go,  Milton Burrell,  there he is,  living legend,  look at him  and he bought a wheelchair  for his cock  and Milton leaps out  of his wheelchair  and he goes,  my cock is fine,  the wheelchair's  for my balls. 
[03:30:00]  So,  a roast master  must show respect  to the roast masters  that came before him.  That's a great story.  He wanted to make sure  he told future generations  and a little trivia,  I think Forrest Tucker  had the second biggest dick  in Hollywood.  Yeah,  apparently Forrest Tucker  from F Troop.  Yeah,  he apparently had  a very big dick too.  Interesting.  Oh no.  I have the smallest dick  in the roast business.  Is that it?  Yeah,  yeah.  What about, 
[03:30:30]  who was the greatest roaster  before you there,  Jeff?  You know,  I mean,  all fingers point to Rickles  in that case.  Fucking Rickles.  I'm so mad  that we weren't around  when he was in his prime.  Pat Cooper would disagree though.  Pat Cooper didn't think  he was as good.  Pat Cooper said,  no,  he wasn't.  Oh yeah,  he did.  Well,  Cooper,  you know.  A lot of people say  that Rickles got his shtick  from Fat Jackie Leonard  who used to make fun  of the audience also.  So this is a tradition  that goes back to vaudeville,  you know,  and Rickles was the sort of  keeper of the flame 
[03:31:00]  for a long time.  And I do talk about Rickles  in the book  and Milton Burrell's funeral  to keep the storyline going.  I'm there  and it's very emotional for me  because at this point  I love Milton.  I've known him for years  all through his sort of retirement  and he would just hang out  and be my friend  and he passed away  and I was just trying  to get a reputation  for being the roaster  from New York  and I still lived in New York  and I'd fly out  for these roasts  in L.A. or whatever  and the funeral 
[03:31:30]  was very emotional  and the whole family  leaves the chapel  and they all go to bury  to the grave,  you know.  and I knew  that there was this  back room,  like the family room  that had a bathroom  so for two hours  through the ceremony  I gotta pee,  I gotta pee.  As soon as everyone  clears out,  I run back to this  family room  at a,  you know,  what is it,  a forest lawn  in the,  and I'm peeing,  I'm in the bathroom  45 seconds  to pee and wash my hands, 
[03:32:00]  the whole thing,  right?  I open the door,  Rickles is standing there  with his hands on his hips  like he's been waiting  for an hour  and he looks at me,  I don't even hardly know him  but he looks at me,  he recognizes me  and he goes,  what,  was there a dais in there?  So I really feel like  there was a certain,  really fun.  I love passing on  these traditions  and keeping it going  and you know,  one of the reasons  I wrote the book  is because for me  roasting is not competitive,  it's fraternal.  You want young people  to read it 
[03:32:30]  and become good at it  so it stays relevant  and fresh.  Very good.  Let me go to the phone here,  we got John in Red Bank.  Hey John.  Hey,  Jeffrey,  how you doing?  What's up?  I don't know,  has there ever been a time  where you've reluctantly  taken the roast  and you thought the guy,  you know,  they were going to be  a douchebag  but it turned out  they were great  across the board?  Every now and then  I get hired to do  like a private roast.  You know,  and I usually do research  to find out if the guy  is a total schmuck 
[03:33:00]  or what.  So you don't know  the guy from a hole  in the wall  and you just got to go  with the knowledge  from...  Occasionally.  It's like a money gig,  you know,  it's like a money gig.  You got to do it.  That's got to be tough though,  man.  Wow.  So, you know,  I'll talk to the wife  or the assistant  or the boss  or whoever  and I'll try to research  whether this person  is going to be  a good candidate  and figure out  if it's worth it  and, you know,  sometimes it is  and sometimes it isn't  and I'll make up  some excuse.  I won't say  he seems like an asshole  and I don't want to do it.  I'll just say  I'm busy  or it's too much work  but for the most part,  you know,  most people 
[03:33:30]  who want to be roasted  who volunteer,  it's because  they know what...  Most of the reason  they want to be roasted  is because they want  to be able to go on  at the end.  They're like,  you know,  they got a comic  inside them  trying to come out  so you have to be careful  of that too  and those are actually  usually good people  to roast  because, you know,  they're into it.  We did one,  me and Voss did one  years ago  in Atlantic City  for three hosts.  I think it was The Trop.  It was some hotel  down there  and it was basically  an excuse to get gamblers  to,  hey,  come watch your favorite  host be roasted. 
[03:34:00]  So it was all these  old people  and they didn't know  what a roast was.  They just knew  that these guys  that hooked them up  at the hotel  were getting shit on.  It was like 600 people  in the audience  and it really didn't go well.  I was talking about  the one guy's cock size  and people were like,  ugh.  I had like a three.  You know,  roasting's gotten bigger  so people kind of expect,  know what to expect now  where for a long time,  like I can go up  at the comedy clubs  before a roast  and go,  hey,  lady,  come up here.  You're going to be  Joan Rivers  and I'm going to practice  my material  and everybody gets it.  Oh, that's cool.  But when I first started it, 
[03:34:30]  you had to explain  what a roast was.  Everybody thought  I was mean.  You're mean.  No, no, it's a roast.  Now it's like football  and NASCAR.  Roasting is like  the next great  American national pastime.  James in Texas.  James,  we're talking to  Jeffrey Ross,  of course.  Good evening.  Hello.  Hello, Mr. Ross.  Long time no speak.  I'm Victoria's  oldest son, Jimmy.  Okay.  Milton's oldest grandson.  How are you, sir?  Oh, my gosh.  Great to see you. 
[03:35:00]  Hear you.  Is he for real?  Yeah.  Sounds like it.  I'm not little Jimmy anymore,  but don't you always feel  kind of like a needle dick  standing next to Grandpa  taking a leak?  I have the smallest penis  in comedy.  I have an innie.  What are you packing?  You're probably  about five and a half?  No, it's smaller than that.  Are you kidding?  No, I can piss on my balls,  as Jimmy Foxx once told me.  Yeah, no.  All my swagger  comes from talent,  not from physical attributes.  What would you say 
[03:35:30]  about five?  I don't know.  Maybe on a good day.  Maybe if I shave my pubes,  it looks like five and a half.  Okay.  See you about five, man.  Take care.  Thank you for calling,  and long live  the roast master,  Milton Berle.  Fucking a relative  of Milton Berle  listens to the show.  I like that.  That's pretty cool.  A little inside info here.  Bambino from Cleveland  wants to know  about the Friars Club.  Bambino.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Early on,  the Comedy Central roasts  were sponsored  by the Friars Club.  I was just curious  as to why 
[03:36:00]  that was discontinued,  and if any of those  are going to be available  on DVD as well.  I'm going to bail  and listen to my question.  Thanks.  You know,  it was 1997.  I'd been doing the roast  for a couple years  privately  for the Friars Club,  for their members,  for our friends,  and I got a little bit like,  you know,  that young man  kind of,  you know,  swagger going,  why isn't the whole world  seeing these?  These are so fun,  and I'm doing like,  I might as well be  into jousting or Latin. 
[03:36:30]  Like,  it's a lost art  that only,  and my friends downtown  would goof on me.  Oh,  you're going to go  put a suit on,  and,  you know,  now it sounds retro  and cool,  but 15 years ago,  I got mocked incessantly  for hanging out  with the old guys,  and it kind of  drove me crazy  that people weren't  seeing what I considered  to be the world  series of comedy.  Here's the greatest  comedians all going up  talking about  the same subject.  To me,  that was the definition  of alternative comedy,  not going up  and talking about  your grandma  and crying  in some alternative  comedy room. 
[03:37:00]  I was like,  putting on a suit  and hanging out with  these guys  was super cool,  and I got the idea  to call Drew Carey,  who was at that point  had the number one  sitcom on television,  and I'd been,  you know,  grown to be friends with,  and Comedy Central  and the Friars  and said,  let's just try one.  Let's just see what happens.  Just shoot the Friars roast  as is in real time,  and we'll cut it up later,  and it wound up  being this great,  one of the greatest  like things to happen  on Comedy Central.  So Drew Carey  is to comedy 
[03:37:30]  what Mariah Carey  is to comedy.  Yeah,  Drew Carey looks like  Barney Rubble  and Buddy Holly  had a baby  and then peed on it.  And you know,  they're not even dirty,  and at that point,  Comedy Central  was not as open  as they are now  with cursing,  but to their credit,  they let it happen.  We did about four or five  with the Friars Club.  Eventually,  Comedy Central realized  that they had a great brand  here now, too,  and they could elevate it,  and now it's transformed  into almost like  roller derby.  It's like a super roast  where anything goes, 
[03:38:00]  where there's almost  nowhere to take it anymore.  I mean,  you know,  DiPaolo,  Geraldo,  Lampanelli,  me,  it's like,  it's become a Norton.  They've given me one.  It's become bigger  than even I could have imagined  back in 97  when we did Drew Carey.  Sounds like a blast,  but it would be so intimidating  to get up,  because I've seen people  just fucking eat it.  Eat it.  Great comics fall apart  on these things. 
[03:38:30]  And it is just, like,  so embarrassing to watch  as they're just  chewing on their nuts.  I felt bad,  I did a Friars Club one  in New York  for Pat Cooper,  and I made fun  of Robert Klein  because he's known  to tip a few back.  And I actually felt  really bad about that.  Like, I felt,  I feel guilty sometimes  if I hit a guy  like kind of  on his Achilles.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  You were just trying.  It always is tricky.  You know,  I always feel weird  when you make fun  of somebody  saying they're not funny  before they come up 
[03:39:00]  because I feel like  you're undercutting them.  Oh, here comes  the unfunny guy.  But Brad Garrett  was at the Joan Rivers roast,  and he's done a few  of my lines,  and it always bothered me,  you know,  that he was,  so I got him  pretty good.  How'd he do it  at the Joan Rivers roast?  He did fine.  I said,  if you like my act,  folks,  you can hear it again  when Brad Garrett  comes up.  This guy has two writers.  Their names are cut  and paste.  One time,  Al Franken  was at a roast  in New York  at the Friars,  and I said, 
[03:39:30]  folks,  some things in life  just aren't funny,  like AIDS,  cancer,  and Al Franken.  Richard Belzer,  we were roasted.  I said,  when I hear the name  Richard Belzer,  I think a homicide.  When I hear the name  Al Franken,  I think a suicide.  They're fun  and they're quotable.  We had Al Franken  on the show once.  I like Al.  Whatever sense of humor  he had,  that went away  a long time ago  because he was all business.  He's playing  in a different game now,  playing in a different game now.  He's in a political forum. 
[03:40:00]  He gave all us comics  a little bit more  respectability  when he became  a senator,  I thought.  Who's the oldest guy  going to the Friars Club?  The oldest guy?  Who's the oldest guy  still going there?  Sid Caesar,  late 80s.  You know,  Mickey Freeman,  who was in the  Sergeant Bilko show,  Zimmerman.  Wow.  He's in his 90s.  I hung out with him  there the other day,  had a little chopped liver.  What does he do?  He just sits there.  He hangs out.  He tells his jokes.  He's still telling jokes. 
[03:40:30]  One of the good things  about the Friars Club  is they'll treat someone  like Mickey Freeman  the same way  they treated him  40 years ago.  Like he just opened  at the Copa that night  and they'll all  take care of him  and make him feel  relevant and cool.  What else do you do there?  You eat some liver  and what else?  You take a steam,  you go to the gym,  they have events.  You know,  there's luncheons  and all kinds of fun stuff.  You see politicians  and you see Broadway stars  and it's like a showbiz,  it's like a country club  for showbiz folk.  I want to go to lunch  there with you.  We were going to  but I wound up going away. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah,  I mean,  you know,  you know,  like it's a way  to keep the traditions alive.  Jimmy,  that was a no,  by the way.  No,  it wasn't.  Jeff invited me.  I promise you.  I got an email.  Jimbo knows.  He's got an open invite.  They love him  at the Friars.  Jimbo does.  Did you like it there?  It was cool.  It was definitely cool.  Yeah.  Adam Ferrara took me.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Lampanelli's getting married  there next year.  For real?  Yeah.  Who's she married?  Some 400 pound  Italian guy.  Looks scary. 
[03:41:30]  I gave him a copy  of my book.  He ate it.  Jeff wants in.  Jeff in Virginia.  Jeff.  I don't want to do it.  Jeff would just comment  on his recent appearance  on The View.  Oh, yeah.  Dad?  What happened?  What's your take on it, caller?  Tough spot?  Yeah, it was a pretty tough spot.  I thought you handled it well.  I think just the response  of the ladies,  they were pretty much in shock.  I don't know what they were expecting  when you came out,  but I loved watching them 
[03:42:00]  being uncomfortable.  And she just sort of  gave them an example.  No, it wasn't the girl.  It wasn't the regulars.  Here's what happened.  Yeah.  Joy Behar,  been my friend for a dozen years.  She's the first woman ever  to host a Friars Roast.  Funny, too.  She's totally down with this stuff.  I'm going to be on her new  CNN show tomorrow night.  She holds up the book,  introduces me,  sets up what her roast is.  Barbara Walters,  I've also done a roast.  You know,  her dad owned the nightclubs.  She roasted Danny Aiello.  She was filthy. 
[03:42:30]  Barbara Walters,  totally good sport.  Whoopi, obviously,  has a great roast legacy.  She had the famous  Ted Danson moment  with the blackface.  She knows what I'm about.  The guest co-host  is LaToya Jackson.  Uh-oh.  Who's never been  out of her bubble before.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know,  Ichienta gets to ask  one question.  Ichienta.  So it gets to LaToya Jackson.  And she's wearing  an orange suit  with big plastic lapels 
[03:43:00]  and her hair is like  out like this  and she looks totally crazy.  And she holds up my book  and she says,  for people who don't know  what a roast is,  will you explain  what a roast is?  And I go,  well,  it's when we take somebody  we all love and admire  and we put them up  on a pedestal  and we honor them  by dishonoring them.  You know,  it's all in good fun  usually for charity  and I said,  for instance,  LaToya,  if I was going to roast you today,  I'd say,  you look like a hooker  from Battlestar Galactica.  Hilarious.  All the ladies  fall out laughing 
[03:43:30]  and she turns  even whiter  than she already is.  And she goes,  what do you do  when people get insulted  because I'm insulted by that?  And I try to duck the question  and she asked it again  and Barbara Walters  elbows me  because she knows.  Yeah.  She sees it  and she goes,  answer the lady's question.  I said,  well,  LaToya,  I try to just roast  good sports.  And LaToya was like,  oh,  you know,  it was like  out of a Marx Brothers movie.  Oh,  you know,  and yeah,  everybody clapped 
[03:44:00]  and she looked kind of silly.  She had egg on her face.  But it always plays funnier  on TV  than it does in the room  because there's always  that tension in the room.  And I said,  for instance,  Barbara Walters  is a good sport.  I mean,  this is a journalism legend.  She made George Washington  cry about a cherry tree once.  You know,  everybody,  and I put my hand  on Whoopi's shoulder.  I said,  Rosie,  I love what you've done  with your hair.  They all got it,  but for whatever reason.  And afterwards,  LaToya's publicist  thanked me  for dragging her  out of her bubble. 
[03:44:30]  She didn't thank you,  though?  She didn't say anything to you?  She didn't know  how to deal with it.  And I had a little moment  backstage with her  and Barbara  where Barbara said,  you understand how this works?  And you know,  when you're at the view,  the last thing you see  before you walk on stage  is a big sign  that says,  make sparks.  So you want to  shake things up a little.  Yeah.  You know,  she's like a retard,  though.  She's like a retarded child.  She's been locked up,  cooped up with that  wacky family for so long.  She doesn't understand  what that means.  No one has ever  made fun of her outfit. 
[03:45:00]  No.  She just had people around  going,  you look great,  you look awesome,  you're so cool.  Maybe you've inspired her.  She'll dress like a human.  I feel like I probably  gave her a little bit  of a,  you know.  Yeah,  you know,  no one's ever told her.  They've always said,  you look great,  LaToya.  You look fantastic.  Fucking hooker  from Battlestar Galactic.  Does his nose  make me look fat?  I see you're on Twitter.  Do you do some,  some of your old jokes  for the people out there  if they follow you?  I was on the plane yesterday  Twittering  and I lost followers,  so I feel like 
[03:45:30]  What airline has  fucking internet?  Maybe I'm going too far,  but yeah,  I've been,  I've been putting  some stuff out there.  You gotta like tweet less.  It's,  it's,  it's tough for all of us,  but.  You know what I do  is I don't really tweet.  What I do is I,  I retweet Diddy,  P. Diddy's tweets.  They're very earnest  and I mock him  in his tweets.  That's funny.  That is good.  Real Jeffrey Ross  on Twitter  if you want to follow him.  Right on,  Jeffrey,  it's good to see you.  By the way,  how stupid am I?  Jeff tells a funny joke  and I go,  what airline has internet?  I was actually curious.  What airline has internet?  It is crazy.  How important is the internet? 
[03:46:00]  Enjoy Behar  tomorrow night,  headline news,  CNN.  Yeah,  that should be interesting,  her new show.  Everything else  is good with you?  Gonna be on the road,  hitting Seattle and Chicago  and out there  talking about the book,  which I worked a year on  and there's a lot of references  to Jim Norton  and ONA,  so I have a feeling  your fans are gonna dig it.  We got a little ONA  mention in the book?  Of course.  Which one?  I can't remember,  but I remember that it's in there  because the lawyer called me  and the lawyer called me  and they have to fact check everything 
[03:46:30]  and I was like,  oh yeah,  that's cool.  Oh,  we don't care if people lie about us.  It's like the book of life.  If your name's not in there,  you're nobody in this business.  What I read of it,  it's very funny.  Cool,  very cool.  I like it a lot.  And you're not breaking any hips  or anything lately?  I'm staying healthy.  I'm feeling good.  I've been doing yoga.  Yoga?  Yeah,  I can finally do  a downward facing pig.  I do a little yoga.  A little bit.  It's good.  It makes me feel taller  and healthier.  It's a tough workout, man.  I've worked out my whole life  with that fucking yoga.  Jesus Christ.  Adam Ferrara turned me on  to a good yoga studio downtown. 
[03:47:00]  Really?  I don't know if I want to plug it,  but it's really good.  I got an older woman  and she lets me put my bare feet  on her very big,  huge,  70-year-old warm boobs.  But don't you feel good afterwards?  Of course.  They're warm.  So you got to have  good roast jokes.  Like if we were going  to roast each other,  we'd all just have  some good jokes.  Oh boy.  What, Jimmy?  Go ahead.  What do you got?  What do you got?  I don't have any.  My friend Ted likes to roast people.  Ted the roaster?  Yes.  Where is Ted?  I haven't seen him.  Jim Norton is so ugly, 
[03:47:30]  his family pictures  hang themselves.  That's a Milton Bro joke.  That's a good one, though.  Here comes Ted.  Ted?  What, Ted the roaster?  Jeffrey Ross's hair  is so curly,  I'll bet his brush  has got to be used a lot.  Oh, wow, Ted.  Wow, Ted.  Oh, you got me, Ted.  You got me.  Thank you.  That's a woo-woo.  That's a good opener.  You got anything else  on Jeffrey Ross there?  Ted the roaster?  Jeffrey Ross's book  has such a blue cover 
[03:48:00]  that it looks like  where's the red there, Jeff?  What about how long it is?  It's such a long book, Ted.  If that book was any longer,  I'd have to say something about it.  I don't think you're getting  the spirit of the...  I certainly am, Anthony.  Yeah, he's killing.  Ted the roaster's killing.  I don't think you're getting  the spirit of the roast.  Of course I am.  Ted, 20 bucks for a book.  Can you believe that?  Wow, it's so unbelievable  that I can't believe it. 
[03:48:30]  I'm very good at this.  Hey, Anthony,  you have so many goods.  What are you,  the whole army or something?  That's vicious, Ted.  I don't take any prisoners.  Ted's working the room now.  I certainly am.  Ted the roaster.  Ted, have you ever  roasted Milton Berle?  Who's Milton Berle?  He's so old  that I don't know him.  But Ted doesn't understand 
[03:49:00]  sometimes the spirit.  Hey, Danny,  I hear you've been drinking a lot.  I hope you're driving  and you're killed.  That's going too far,  Ted the roaster.  Where's the funny in that?  That's not funny.  That's just really  wishing something horrible  on somebody.  I like that.  Ted the roaster.  You could just nickname  toaster.  Hey, toaster.  Oh, yeah,  they call me the toaster  because I pop it up  and shake it around.  Throw it in the tub.  What's that?  What do you mean the tub?  What type of talk is that? 
[03:49:30]  Ted the roaster,  you got anything on E-Rock?  What's that?  You got anything on E-Rock?  He enjoys a good roast.  Yeah, E-Rock sure does.  E-Rock's neck is so fat  that when he has a stroke,  he'll be dead  before help gets there.  I know.  That's good, right?  That's cutting deep, toaster.  Oh, sorry.  Toaster Sheckler.  Sheckler.  That's Sheckler.  What about Jim Norton, toaster?  You ever roasted Jim Norton?  He's not really popular enough,  apparently.  Holding a grudge  because Comedy Central 
[03:50:00]  only asked you for one?  I respect they don't like me.  Why don't they like it?  Well, it is what it is.  It's okay.  I accept it.  It's not like they're  doing five a year.  No, I know,  but historically with the network,  they just don't dig me.  But again, whatever.  You're too much of a potty mouth  is what it is.  Everyone has their own taste.  You're too dirty.  You roasted saget, right?  That's because Bob requested me.  Oh, okay.  That's not a good thing.  Special request.  Yeah, Bob's buddy.  That was a great one.  You were great.  Thank you.  They didn't think so.  Anthony's shirt is so green,  but it's envious. 
[03:50:30]  That would be the one  I closed with.  I would get a standing ovation.  You look like Chee Rivera.  Chee Rivera.  You know,  yeah, right.  The revolutionary.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I've never seen that many freckles.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Well, you know, it's just a birth thing.  You know, I came that way.  Oh, okay. 
[03:51:00]  Sorry.  You got a few freckles.  Yeah!  They're gonna call you Raggedy Andy Arms Ross.  Ha!  Ha!  I'm very sensitive, Ted, about that.  I didn't mean to say that.  I was molested.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Well, you're not supposed to admit that in the overall rose.  My uncle Paul put his diggle in my mouth, Jeffrey.  Really?  Yeah.  It smelled like sardine oil.  Cause he would eat sardines that hold his penis and slap my face.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  This isn't good roast material.  No, no, you're making everyone uncomfortable.  Ted, this is really a lot in a good way.  I don't try a lot, and Uncle Paul will just stay deeper. 
[03:51:30]  Deeper, Ted.  Deeper.  No.  I like to do roast, too.  Paul the roaster?  Uncle Paul the roaster?  Anybody can be a roaster.  Apparently.  No.  Ted's a hoot.  Yeah, Ted's a good roaster.  All right.  I think we're done.  This is super fun.  Thank you for having me on.  Yeah, it's been seen it, Jeffrey.  It's been a while.  Absolutely.  I only roast the ones I love.  It's fucking funny.  And Busting Balls Without Burning Bridges.  It's actually, his editor is the same as mine, Trish, and Simon and Schuster. 
[03:52:00]  They're the same people.  They give you total creative freedom.  And it's fucking funny, man.  What I read is really funny.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  Come back and see us.  Always, fellas.  Very good.  Great to see you.  Thank you.  And there's actually, I heard one thing about it.  No, you didn't.  I actually did.  Oh.  That in Boston, November 28th, and Buffalo and Kansas City, I will be appearing.  But I mentioned in Jeff's book.  So if you bring Jeff's book to my appearances in those cities, we could talk about it.  How was that?  Totally.  Kind of helped us both.  Totally love that idea.  Any friend of Norton's is a friend of mine. 
[03:52:30]  Hey, I hear you like to roast a lot of people.  What are you, chestnuts?  Roastmastergeneral.com for your copy.  You got it.  I'm going to be signing Jim Norton's book also.  All right.  Oh, God.  I don't think Ted's roast lines are very sharp.  They're pretty stinks.  Ted, give us one more before we leave today.  One more.  You got Sam.  You got Steve.  Oh, Sam.  Nice hair.  Looks like you've got a couple of buns there.  Wow, I didn't mean to hit so hard. 
[03:53:00]  Ted, did you ever roast Mackenzie Phillips?  Who?  You know, the girl who was molested, who had sex with her father?  That's a funny roast joke.  Hey, Mackenzie, I heard you had sex with your father.  Did I tell you that I had sex with my uncle?  Yes, yes.  But I didn't want to.  Uncle Paul told me he was going to tell him where I was smoking.  With the old candy cigarettes. 
[03:53:30]  He said he was going to tell my litter.  Ted's a great roaster.  You sure know how to.  He's on it.  Hey, that's a great, great shirt, Gregory.  What are you, some kind of a battleship or something?  Just in from war or harbors?  Oh, war or harbors.  What?  It's a battleship gray.  What's the matter?  Did you get it?  I'm very good at this.  He's the best. 
[03:54:00]  I guess it's a battleship gray, right?  You've met your competition, Jeffrey Ross.  Yeah.  I love the brutal honesty, Ted.  Brutal honesty.  Yeah.  Ted always goes too far.  Right.  Hey, nice curly hair, Anthony.  What are you, fuck children?  No.  No.  Wow.  Where did that come from?  Wow.  That's not going to get you on Comedy Central, Ted the roaster.  No.  Yeah, you got to, you know, I don't think you get the gist of it.  You got to soften up the edges a little bit.  There's got to be a joke there.  No. 
[03:54:30]  I thought that the curly hair thing would get a big laugh.  Then I ran out of steam and just added something.  A pedophile accusation?  Sure, why not?  I was winking when I said it.  Oh, okay.  Jim, I mean, Ted, what about a sincere moment to close things off with?  Ah, right, right.  I say, you know, sometimes we have so much fun at these events, we forget that little  boys are molested by family members.  No, no.  We should never do that to a boy's Heidi. 
[03:55:00]  No, does not always mean yes, Uncle Paul.  Thank you.  Wow, that would be a good closer, all right.  Yeah, that's a great closer.  He made me drink warm papaya juice out of a can while he fingered my backside angrily.  Angrily?  Shouting, bad Ted, dirty Ted.  This explains everything about Ted Sheckler.  It certainly does.  He told me that there were ghosts under my sheets and he had to protect me.  Fuck you.  Wow. 
[03:55:30]  Great way to end it.  Ted the roaster and Jeffrey Ross.  Jeffrey Ross.  We're out for today, guys.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Later.  I don't know. </pre>
