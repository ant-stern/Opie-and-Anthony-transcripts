<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of the fictional "trout flu," allegedly originating from Robert Kelly's fly-fishing trip, spreading to staff and listeners.  Opie then recounts his recent throat scope procedure, detailing his hazy, sexually suggestive experiences under the influence of propofol.  The conversation shifts to Jamie Lee Curtis, her aging, and her Activia commercials, escalating into sexually explicit jokes about her body and women's underwear.  The David Letterman scandal is discussed, with Opie expressing a lack of sympathy and speculating about revenge and financial motivations.  This segues into a discussion of Opie's own past relationship.

A substantial portion focuses on the John and Kate Gosselin divorce, featuring audio clips of their interviews, met with derision and laughter from the hosts.  Listener calls contribute to the commentary on their behavior and financial struggles.  The discussion continues into the legal and reality TV aspects of the Gosselin divorce, briefly interrupted by mentions of a fight between a cab driver and a pedicab driver, and the success of Fox News' Red Eye.  The "trout flu" jokes reappear before transitioning to another segment.

This next segment heavily features the David Letterman scandal, including analysis of Letterman's on-air apologies and reactions from other late-night hosts.  A vulgar and lengthy tangent on a sexually suggestive Mary Poppins parody song ensues.  The hosts discuss their television aspirations, frustrations with their agent, and their complaints about SiriusXM management and a promotional announcement, playing and criticizing multiple versions.  A significant portion is dedicated to "Jocktober," a deep dive into a low-rated Southwest Florida radio show, "Big Mama and the Wild Bunch," featuring numerous calls to listeners and participants, playing audio clips, and heavily criticizing the hosts' appearances and personalities with extensive vulgar and offensive language. Sam, a show contributor, is the only identified guest in-studio for this section.

The following segment introduces "the Virus," an inept comedian repeatedly failing to deliver jokes about the Gosselin divorce.  The John and Kate Gosselin story, Perez Hilton's radio appearances, David Letterman's scandal, and Roman Polanski's conviction are discussed.  Sports topics, including the Yankees, Jets, and Vikings, are also covered.  The hosts discuss workplace dynamics and the perceived oversensitivity surrounding sexual harassment, using Letterman as an example, criticizing modern workplace culture and lawsuits. Lady Gaga's SNL performance and a *The View* segment on Letterman are referenced.  Further attempts to get jokes from the Virus and general banter conclude this segment.

The final segment begins with teasing a surprise, followed by Sam entering with Ted Williams' head.  A cake depicting Anthony with his pants down and money coming out of his anus, celebrating his alimony freedom, is revealed, with discussions about its design.  A news story about raccoons attacking a woman leads to a vulgar discussion about which animals deserve to be killed.  A caller shares a dubious anecdote about a raccoon parasite, and the hosts discuss a BET founder mocking a stuttering Virginia gubernatorial candidate, Craig Deeds (audio played),  resulting in further offensive commentary.  The "beep game" is applied to the raccoon story, "Line of the Day" entries are read, and the segment concludes with promotion for Jimmy's stand-up shows, along with the continued running gag about Sam's unusual running style.

[00:18:00]  bit like a crab sideways and his legs are shaking his tails up you can tell he's embarrassed oh of  course he is he's completely embarrassed front of everybody well we're just getting started we're  gonna get into the letterman stuff because this story just is wow it's just terrific it i love it  i absolutely love it and also people can't get enough of it and we're not really sure but uh we  think uh the virus is going to be making another appearance today i uh i heard some of the virus wow 
[00:18:30]  yeah that's what the show needed was like a character well it's kind of part of it's kind of  part of jocktober i guess because we're making fun of all these other radio shows and they have these  horrendous characters so sam grabbed erock and made uh erock come up with a character on the spot  yeah and sam basically told erock he has to be called the virus he has to march into the studio  and uh and he has to have a fake voice and his whole thing is he's the virus and he's infecting 
[00:19:00]  everybody with hilarity the problem is he has a great setup to a lot of potential jokes but no punch  so there's no hilarity oh he spread nothing but boredom and rage  then we made then we made tank hankerous come into the studio and drag the virus out and of course  in a stunning dual role wow of course for the for the uh the regulars you know who tank hankerous is 
[00:19:30]  they're both played by erock which made it very very funny all right so we're gonna do that hopefully  a little later tank hanker it also will be beating up another radio show because because uh they  stink because they stink yes well first letterman you know uh god we nailed it again letterman on i  think last thursday went on tv and shocked everybody with the news of the uh extortion and the blackmail  and the sex sex the sex with staffers dirty and then he said well this is about all i'm gonna say on 
[00:20:00]  this yeah and i said it friday and i said yesterday i'm like there's no fucking way he's got to continue  there's no way you do the type of show he does and not mention it yeah knowing that everyone's just  thinking about it and sure enough yesterday he got right back into talking about uh what is going on  in his life great yeah i bet the the ratings threw the roof oh my god yeah what a scandal to have uh 
[00:20:30]  uh if you have a tv show it's because people are gonna tune in and watch i'm reading this as we  were like starting the show and and uh it's like the halderman guy i think is fucked up but the more  you read the more you're like like apparently according to this they were dave was seeing her  and that was it and they remained friends and she stayed on staff yeah and then the diary revealed  that she was having this again it says here that the diary revealed that she was having sex with  letterman while she was dating halderman so halderman's reading this and she even went to 
[00:21:00]  montana last fall to hike with him and left her boyfriend home and he was worried and she's like  no no i'm dave's best friend that's all it is we're friends it's platonic there was some fucking going  on that well that's to me and then i think they said that letterman wanted her to stay on because  she's a law graduate so he offered her a job as his personal lawyer oh boy and then she tried to get  this guy to marry her saying look i'll be he's i'm gonna make great money to me look if you're  dating somebody i had no idea that this guy's agenda was now the as the scorned uh lover it's much more 
[00:21:30]  revenge probably money too but that that's more like you can't kill the guy what are you gonna do  but if it to me he was stupid because if you if your girlfriend is going away with her ex-boyfriend  you you have to dump her you you have to dump her it's it it's almost shenanigans i think it's  almost impossible to be friends with your ex yeah you know it's almost impossible without some type of  uh sexual energy there or you know i'm friends with one of my exes with no sexual energy i have no 
[00:22:00]  what's his name who uh that was that what are you trying to say that you're a homo oh  donald but it wasn't donald but i know oh okay it's manda thanks for protecting me jimmy  very welcome everybody knows that it's not a big secret anyway you were never a boyfriend  i always thought i was no not at all you were just my face fuck friend  like facebook what's worse than being face fucked by a large gentleman against your will 
[00:22:30]  nothing i agree i have fuck i have no desire to talk to any of my exes none maybe my first  girlfriend in college yeah yeah she lives in unica and she has four kids and i remember as a  cute little thing uh you did i remember as a 19 or 20 year old and now i think she's in her 40s  you'd be gravely disappointed yeah just out of curiosity to see how her life went like i don't 
[00:23:00]  really yeah i don't pine over none of that shit pining over but just out of curiosity because i  think i think officially she was like my my first yeah my first love see how her life went there's  only i think there's only one girl i would like to see just to rub it in her fucking face a little  bit oh i have a few of those too yeah yeah i do have a few of those i remember i have a bitch in  buffalo i would love to say hi too dude i remember a speech about um what a piece of shit

[00:24:00]  she laid into me once and i think i said something stupid this is so many years ago i mean i i think i  was 20 maybe 19 something like that and and i said something like yeah well you know someday maybe  i'll be driving by and see you and i'll be wearing a suit and tie like like that's the kind of job i  know that was your idea of making it yeah a suit and a tie you were on your way to a funeral 
[00:24:30]  or a wedding or on your way to fucking certain hard drive photos uh charges  it's true i think that now i get such a douchey chill why you and your fancy suit and tie and  she even said she goes oh you think that's making it huh oh really yeah i think she was a little  smarter and uh more mature than i was why what's that success than a man driving by in a suit and tie  i know who drives by in their suit it gets all wrinkled i was gonna drive by and i'd see her and 
[00:25:00]  stop and go like like ha well i told you i'd be here that's right you're nude underneath it just  your jacket and tie yeah and you're jerking off my dick sticking out like where the thing buttons  together just the jacket wearing no pants that's right you got pre-cum on the front of your awful  jacket but i have real shiny shoes on so you don't get glass on your feet when you jerk off in front of  school yeah so she you know she gave me some of that crap so i would like to bump into uh rub it

[00:30:30]  your way in midtown they just they can't go fast enough because they're a fucking bicycle and they're  too wide so even if they're all the way to the right or left depending on which way the road's  going you can't get around them yeah i i'm i'm more upset with the vespas they are taking over  they are taking over but at least i don't know if it's happening in your city but leave wherever  the fuck they want fuck no how about the guys that think they could you know stay up to speed with 
[00:31:00]  you and they're right in front of you right in the middle of the lane you're in the car i got you  yeah get the fuck over i don't care if the vespas are zigging and zagging in and out of traffic i  don't give a shit about any of that crap who cares you know if you could do that god bless you but the  ones that all of a sudden pull up to a red light right in front of you in the middle of the lane  and it takes them what 20 minutes to get up to speed and those dumb things there's so many and  just so many annoying things the the vespas fucking city they took over european cities years ago oh yeah 
[00:31:30]  years and years ago we're finally catching up i mean in another few years you're gonna see just  i don't know hundreds and hundreds of vespas on any given day well that's the united states uh mission  to become a third world country it's great we're well on our way it's fantastic all right yeah so people  on vespas little skinny cobblestone streets we're gonna take our first break then we're gonna clear  the field and get into this letterman stuff the latest stuff monologue steve martin was on yeah 
[00:32:00]  making some funny and uh we got uh jack tober to do oh jack tober uh i know you guys are at least get  a little tease what's the uh show where i don't know i don't know what's sam always know sam is the  guy and um i know there's not a lot of john and kate fans out there but this thing is getting  ugly oh yeah and it's following the same path that uh you once had to go down there ant yeah you hear  that uh he cleared out her bank account yep i heard that one bravo for him he cleared out their 
[00:32:30]  joint account and i the lawyers are demanding that he gives it back but go fuck yourself but i think  he's he doesn't have to do that how about he just says go fuck yourself uh you're not getting it back  you know maybe she shouldn't have been such a bitch yeah not for nothing but before he took out that 230  she had taken out a hundred thousand and then put it back and her uh reasoning for taking out a 
[00:33:00]  hundred thousand dollars was so that if anything happened she could feed the kids well all right  hold on the hundred thousand the hundred thousand would be would be half and she was ordered to put  that back after it's a joint account you're thinking all right half is mine half is yours yeah  that's what then he turned around and said fuck that and took just about all of the 230 thousand i think  he left her with a thousand left a grand in the grand here you go and now she was on tv last night  crying on now i don't know how i'm gonna pay pay the bills and feed my kids thank god good good 
[00:33:30]  oh it's so good to see that happen that way holy shit the shock she must have went when she went to  withdraw some money went what yeah i only have a thousand left yep yeah it doesn't feel so good does  and if you're gonna parade your wife uh your your life on tv like that i i have no sympathy i'm laughing  the whole time when i watch this shit then i love how he uh pulled that whole thing with hey i don't  want the kids on tv right wreck the show there it is he said fuck you single-handedly just end the 
[00:34:00]  fucking show i don't want my kids to be subjected to the well that uh type that's because stupid tlc goes  look you know the ratings were were horrendous so that they knew they could make a run at it with uh kate plus  eight yeah so they're like we're gonna we're just gonna push john out here oh my john's like oh  really okay my kids too sorry there's a line or two in the contract that says if i don't want them  filmed anymore yep you can't do it now go go on with your show called kate right go on with your 
[00:34:30]  show called kate and her empty bank account go ahead and don't forget we were the ones that brought it to  a lot of people's attention how much of a bitch this uh woman was to the guy we felt bad for the guy  boy we were we were calling this shit well before there was even an inkling that there was a problem  with the marriage there was a problem that she was treating him like a fucking little bitch yeah  but uh do we have an audio of her crying about the money uh yeah we do yeah yeah that's gonna be good 
[00:35:00]  that's a good one it's gonna be really good well actually we could do it now fuck it oh i want to  hear a little of that now and then after the break we'll do the letterman stuff good for this guy  she nagged him relentlessly she nagged him fucking relentlessly she was a fucking bitch to this guy  every second and not even like all right we're on tv so i'm gonna play up like i'm the bitch right and  you're you know placating me this woman was a fucking psychopath yep all these fucking kids and 
[00:35:30]  this this emasculated husband walking around yesing her to death all of a sudden he hooks up  with some college broad and goes hey see you later this is what it's like huh see ya right and now  she's she couldn't be nicer she completely changed her too no yeah did she well um well i don't think  she did no she's playing you know she's playing it the other way now she's a twat i wonder how many  fucking bless things this counts as yeah oh bless things 200 and something thousand bless things a 
[00:36:00]  lot of bless things she has a thousand bless things left here we go kate says john emptied  their joint bank account well let's talk about the latest that that you have uh awakened to this report  that john emptied a joint bank account of hundreds of thousands of dollars leaving you with just a  thousand dollars is that accurate it is accurate um you know when we started this out i was determined  um i didn't want to discuss this stuff i didn't want it out there i didn't want to talk about it  obviously it has gotten out you're a private person and it is true oh why why private person are you 
[00:36:30]  you didn't want to discuss that kind of stuff join the club join the celebrity club that's right  welcome aboard there is no private shit dummy you're parading your kids on tv like that yeah  to make a few bucks a few shekels a little yeah uh kate explains the joint bank account contained all  their liquid money she had taken money out before and what were the stipulations with regard to that 
[00:37:00]  account when you could take out money and for what purposes uh back in the beginning when we had our  first meeting um the arbitrator said that neither one of us could take money um without the other  consent however i was given historically i am the bill payer i am the money manager so obviously i  was allowed to show proof of every bill i paid still fuck you then fuck you you know we were told i had  to do this but i was the bill payer i was this i was that so still humiliating him so i can take the 
[00:37:30]  money out and he can't touch it fuck you good for this guy good i hope he blows it all on cocaine and  hookers young girls like 20 year olds 25 year olds he's just fucking handing out hundreds to him for  blowjobs he'd give them extra thousands to eat his ass great here's a grand start licking he just  he just starts living a rap video just fucking booty girls all over the place they just find him in a  puddle of his own sweat and cum right yeah where's the money gone it's all gone try to find where it is 
[00:38:00]  so obviously i was allowed to show proof of every bill i paid and use that money that way the money  um our liquid um money this joint bank account contained all of our liquid money and um it was  sitting there waiting to be um paid he was not allowed to touch it at some point i removed it to  keep it safe on the suggestion of my lawyer but needed to put it back according to the arbitrator i  did that see you both didn't trust each other look you were worried he was going to take it he was 
[00:38:30]  worried you were going to take it the only reason you put it back is because they told you to  fucking put it back she went first and took it that's right he was stupid enough to put it back  because this happens all the time yep all the time it's the biggest thing marriage falls apart the  first thing you do is go well i don't give a shit about her anymore i got to get to that joint bank  account before she does and it's a second it's a race against time anthony learned i learned the hard  way let me tell you something the second you see your marriage going south get your ass to that 
[00:39:00]  fucking joint bank account and drain it don't take half don't leave a grant empty that fucking  account don't be a nice guy and leave a little i don't think you could close it without the other  person's consent but you could leave in the absolute minimum sure take every fucking penny out and then  you know what uh they might tell you to put it back but then your lawyer will put a motion that says i  don't have to and that and before you know it months maybe years have gone by and then no one 
[00:39:30]  gives a shit about that money anymore and you've been living off of it so have fun do it that way  but but the first person that bank wins every time that's the winner right there you want to talk about  a reality show i'd watch every week yes divorce bank right divorce bank where you fucking sit there  you find out who's getting divorced tonight's couple is by the bank tonight's couple is tom and  joanne and you watch joanne go in right and then you watch poor asshole tom smiling and whistling as 
[00:40:00]  he's filling out his withdrawal slip with his radio partner friend  and much to his chagrin there's jack shit left in there it's just an amazing moment  oh that was an amazing moment i was like i'm gonna i'm gonna when i had to watch the teller tell  you that major notes and i had money in and then i took it how much was left major i forget the total 
[00:40:30]  now i don't know it was like a hundred dollars yeah yeah it was less than a grand and she had to tell  you sorry oh it's every penny i had would you watch a reality show where where they set up the  couples would i ever tom and joanne would i ever and they're off oh it'd be great amazing race  ah amazing race to the bank to the bank oh my god looking like the scene at a casino with it going  to the bank hitting each other the cops are there right god let's sell that show to spike tv 
[00:41:00]  kate says john has taken money out in the past john has now left her with one thousand dollars  all right one g i felt why did you remove it did you think that he was going to try to take funds out  of that account he had done it um a few days before i filed for divorce he didn't empty it completely  but it was enough that um that that i was afraid in fact at some point um up until that point i had 
[00:41:30]  taken a hundred thousand dollars and put it aside safely so that i could buy my kids food if this  occurred i was afraid literally buying erratic purchases randomly purchasing things she's starting  to choke up what jet skis fucking things that are fun things that aren't you stuff for his new girl  yeah stuff for the new girl what'd you see some jewelry store shit there some nice designer clothes  yeah some clothes stuff from forever 21 what did you see 
[00:42:00]  not a tear in this eye man fuck you we saw how much of a bitch she was on tv i went sam interview  her i wonder how many people are actually feeling sorry for i'm sure there's a bunch of broads  and just because you're a female doesn't mean you're a broad by the way i'm sure believe me she's  probably got money flying in right now for the kids food don't worry about it maybe you won't be  able to get your hair fucking done or your nails and your makeup maybe you go back to looking like you 
[00:42:30]  did that hair is confusing what is it i don't know horrendous yeah it's better than it was though  what wouldn't have been yeah i don't know fucking anything really buying erratic purchases randomly  purchasing things and i'm sorry um the last thing i wanted was to do this show and end up  not being able to pay my bills so i put money aside willingly brought it forward and split it with him 
[00:43:00]  when we had our meeting so he took the 50 000 and did whatever with it i paid bills with my 50 000  and once the court arbitrator stepped in i felt like the money i had to put it back i didn't feel like it  would be safe to be honest and um he took 230 000 of the 231 000  and i have a stack of bills in my purse i can't drop him  i love this guy good yeah thank you vincent bayonne 100 000 for food what the hell are those kids eating 
[00:43:30]  i know bullions again like the second time it's fucking ridiculous this is all posturing lawyer  bullshit posturing oh and in the end guess who gets the money stinks so does this studio  in the end the lawyers get the money yeah that's what happens yep and finally one more clip here to play 
[00:44:00]  let me tell you what his lawyer said they did we reached out they did not respond to us but they  they did respond to et and the insider and they said john quote has not withdrawn any money for his  own remuneration with the exception of the past several months wherein he believes he only withdrew  approximately 175 000 and quote it is not unlikely when the arbitrator or court receive a full accounting  of all the proceeds that john will be awarded substantial additional funds i i have a few 
[00:44:30]  comments to that first of all i have um the accounting over the last few months and it's exactly 230 000  dollars beginning on august 10th and um his last withdrawal was september 29th um second of all um  it's it's wonderful to say that he will be awarded significant funds however there are no significant  funds for him to be awarded and i don't care um that he feels he needs to be awarded this when  you've left your children and their mother unable to pay the roof for the roof over their head it's 
[00:45:00]  not acceptable will you demand that money be redeposited in the account i have to in order to  keep my kids where they live and to put food on their table i need that money to provide for them  where they live a really nice you have to understand my position here we were in a position after our  sex tuplets were born that we could not pay our bills um we did the show to provide a better life  for them never did i think i would be back in the same position um worried about providing for them 
[00:45:30]  let's say hi hi to greg in dc greg greg  greg good morning boys happy birthday jimmy thanks not you  anyway uh gentlemen i was calling to say kate is such a wonderful fantastic mother who just  she's worried about her kids so much who's watching them right now yeah who's watching them she probably 
[00:46:00]  has a nanny she doesn't she can't afford one she she doesn't really raise her kids she has other  people raising her kids and doing all the hard work of course this broad is all over the place  who's watching the kids yeah who is watching the kids when all this shit's going on you know i can't  get out my brother just got his third kid i can't get him on the phone he doesn't have time to do  interviews and and shit he can't play golf anymore but this woman could do whatever she wants busy  she's all over the media every why is she speaking publicly it's not necessary in a legal proceeding 
[00:46:30]  how to comment publicly no it's because she loves the media attention and that's why i will not be  shedding a tear over this one it's probably very detrimental to her case yeah they always tell you  to shut the fuck up yeah they're gonna they're gonna shut up both sides soon yep but until they  do this is gonna be some good tv to watch him he beat the uh he beat her to the bank and uh took out  all the money he must have been sitting there going what's the balance you think there was a thought  process they're like what's the balance 250 i'll take i'll take one one and a quarter i'll take no 
[00:47:00]  no you know something fuck no you're sort of right he probably started out like yeah i'll take half  take half and then he started thinking of all the demeaning things she said over the years yeah  and it just kept it was like you know what no fuck i'm gonna that was worth 10 grand right there  i'm gonna take three fits remember the time she was yelling at me about some fucking thing and i  looked like a real fucking dick bag on television that's worth 25 000 right all right that time oh  oh uh let's see three years without sex you don't think they're having sex they were not even coming 
[00:47:30]  close to having sex dude why do you say that all the kids first of all it sounds like she might  have constant distraction but she it sounds like she might have been having sex with john like like  jimmy had recently oh strap i didn't have it though i tried to fail to let everybody down the team  believe me so far she's when she's talking liquid assets it wasn't between her legs that's a dried up 
[00:48:00]  fucking hole and there was no way he was having sex with it do you think that he was going to just  empty the whole account and then they said you have to leave a thousand in or else you have to notify  both parties that the account is empty so maybe he said fuck it i'll leave the minimum in that you have  to yeah you have to get out of dodge you have to leave a minimum or else uh the other party has to be  and then maybe the notice would have went yeah a phone call would have been made but if he didn't  empty it then he could just kind of skedaddle that's what happened uh let's say hi to justin in new york  justin hey what's going on guys hey man um i hate to say it also but my girlfriend is blindly 
[00:48:30]  supporting kate and she's such a fucking castrating bitch um when the sex couples were born i thought  they were sponsored with a lot of products and that was one of the stipulations of the show like diapers and  all that yeah and i thought the tough one was food until they were teenagers by peapod or shop  right right you're you're correct justin they got all sorts of deals because they had the six kids  at one time a bunch of sponsors came forward that if you watch the show at all if you take a peek 
[00:49:00]  they're constantly when they were together constantly going on these amazing vacations  they got to move into a huge house so they have more room yeah and a lot of that stuff is being  paid for by other other parties so it doesn't fucking need her money and then and then of  course they're getting the nice tv money for for selling their souls so we could all uh look in  and see how the kids are doing all right punch it up good job justin uh let me say hi to beth in jersey 
[00:49:30]  beth hey hey beth i hear your calling oh nothing um this chick has an organic chef so i'm not sure  why she's so worried about feeding them tlc supplies that for her well also do we have audio of john  because he says she's lying oh yeah yeah we'll find that jimmy i have uh i have the transcript right  here yeah why don't you read that make it easy john goslin says that kate's claims are a total  fabrication she's hiding money i don't know i don't know where she'd put it perhaps in that 
[00:50:00]  giant womb he's denying his estranged wife's claims that he wiped out their bank account  and took 230 grand um she said it uh her allegations are not true according to john he said it's just  bullshit and that he took out 22 000 last thursday adding that he had a paper trail to prove it  over the past four years doing the show he said they accrued about two million two hundred and fifty  thousand dollars wow we she said in the past that he took out 230 he said he uh withdrew roughly 
[00:50:30]  one hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars over the course of a year which is less than ten  percent of what they made and that's like my paycheck he said but then again if he in a year  he's taken out ten percent that's probably too much but whatever how do we how do they make two  million over the course of the whole thing with book the book and yeah and have things and all they  have is 200 and well he says she's hiding stuff ah and they may have bought the house outright  they may own the house i don't know what they own but they may yes right i thought the 230 000 seemed 
[00:51:00]  a little low i did i did to me too they're big stars for this tlc but if she's got a hit book out  there and if she's claiming that that you know it's taking the food away it's keeping up from buying  food like all she has yeah in the world is a thousand dollars that's uh so there's been some  fucking she's misrepresenting first of all tlc would would would turn around and make sure that uh  they're well provided for because they they don't want to lose kate anytime soon well he said  here's what he said he said that uh he's objecting to her claims that uh he uh withdrawals left with 
[00:51:30]  no money he said she's hiding money he told the insider he goes we have 11 bank accounts that was  our joint account she's high she had a best-selling book where's that million dollars yeah also so he  didn't get to share in in the book i don't know he had to have maybe he had to get a little piece  right yeah but he's saying that they had 11 bank accounts mike on long islands remind me mike of  something too we don't have to go to him but oh she had a shitload of plastic surgery john got uh hair 
[00:52:00]  plugs did he yeah they got all sorts of work done yeah who paid for that i guess they're getting all  this stuff for free because it makes for good tv so like okay uh you know we'll do a few shows  revolving around you getting hair plugs so you get the hair plugs for free i want to do a reality show  where i get a tummy tuck i want to get a tummy tuck a tummy tuck but i want them to bunch it all  up in the front like a scrunchie i don't want to take any off i just want them to staple it so it 
[00:52:30]  bunches out like a little hair scrunchie in the front there you could start something new a new trend  yeah be nice uh nah someone's saying that twat doesn't need money for food she needs it for a  tummy tuck the pictures they showed on some of the gossip sites they did a good job putting that  shit back together they she was in a bikini recently and you're like what that body had  eight kids no way pat from monaki suggesting that the smartest the smartest withdrawal would have  been uh right before he came uh let's go to craig in jersey craig yo hey craig hey uh i got the 
[00:53:00]  solution to this problem yeah uh if you want to call it a problem just start selling the kids off  one by one make some money can you imagine john goes you know what he just grabs one in the middle  of the night there you go sells it to some i don't know chic i can't imagine that where would you sell  a five-year-old paul who would who would buy a five-year-old from there's plenty of people that  would uh yeah people can't have kids yeah just start selling them yeah one by one i watched the 
[00:53:30]  forensic files where some guy actually killed his fucking kid killed his son for eighty thousand dollar  insurance for eighty thousand lousy dollars thousand dollars then he set the house on fire  to try to make it look like it we fucked up so bad oh they that forensic files man they are going to  nail you you watched a few of those you watch a few of those and you're like there's no way i would  ever get away with a crime you so would a little pusharoo yeah grand canyon pusharoo i call it yeah but if 
[00:54:00]  you're just uh grand canyon pusharoo i don't know i don't know that's tough you can't burn down your  own house they only don't i don't know how they figure that shit out yeah they figured it out well  they took he actually took the kid out and then burnt the house and then like choked him put him  in a garbage pail took him somewhere and then they figured out like choked him where his cell phone call 
[00:54:30]  came from and it was too far away from where he said he was really found vomit like the kid was  throwing up as his father was choking him and they found out what he was eating and what that was and  it was on his truck and they just i mean they how old was the kid everything it's like 10 he's a 10  year old not even an infant or no no like a 10 year old who knew what was happening yeah it was sick  dude totally fucking sick guy get the death penalty of course no no i think yeah you know 10 years or  something stupid save every human life right yeah we gotta be nice gotta be no i didn't i don't think 
[00:55:00]  they went into what his sentence was but uh boy they go into that fucking shit they could find  everything little speck a little speck of blood and they're getting dna off of anything now they  found out a skull that was so old and that they they were able to get pulp though out of the tooth  and and get a dna profile from that fucking thing that's unbelievable and then once you got that  tooth pulp yeah jesus pulp out of an old fucking skull and jizz you can't leave that 
[00:55:30]  shit anywhere no oh my god will they get your jizz it is amazing they will just sponge that  shit up that's yeah give you a 15 to 30 i was laughing my ass over that scene in super bad where  it's like you know you'd think there's semen on everything but uh there was no semen so we won't  catch them right because when i first came on the job i thought there was just semen everywhere  but it's like they took a swab and found she had been sexually assaulted so their semen was put in 
[00:56:00]  you know even cold case files where they grabbed some semen from like 1970 and put it in an envelope  and years later they got you know in 19 late 90s they're able to make a profile and they find this  guy and they knock on his door it's like hey remember that chick you fucking raped and killed in 1970  welcome to prison you gotta think that's a big relief for the guy some of them they they the cops  say they go to the door and they go like like oh they kind of are like oh okay instead of looking 
[00:56:30]  over your shoulder every fucking day waking up in cold sweats going i killed someone right i bet  you in a weird way it's it's a relief you're like all right yeah fuck i just can't live with the fact  that i killed this person some people fight it some people kill themselves it's a great show  yeah those things just sit there and just watch those constantly all right we're gonna take our  first break and then we're gonna get into the letterman stuff uh yes this is worth another play  um anthony you remember mars couldn't say david dacovny no he couldn't and he couldn't do it 
[00:57:00]  we brought mars in he was five six feet away from david dacovny and and trying to say his name who  was really cool by the way david dacovny he really was thinking about that it's like that's very cool he  hung out after the show he's like i'm in new york a lot i would love to combine you know  come by sooner than later i'm like yeah anytime man he was fun a lot of fun so uh mars big fan  can't say his name just made a fool of himself it was some terrific radio he really did though he was

[00:58:00]  well there's no surprise there fucking i want to just give them a big shout out yeah of course  they uh they're in a league of their own when it comes to cable news shows but that doesn't mean  it's a player despite it's late start time the ratings for the show continues to improve and  surprisingly top some cable news competition you might not expect the ratings came out for september  red eye is up over 30 percent in total viewers and 50 percent in the key demo which is 25 to 54 which is 
[00:58:30]  ours since july they have more overall viewers than every cnbc show every msnbc show that is on  before hardball most of hln and american morning on cnn they uh they have a fucking a lot of viewers  man that's great yeah they have more viewers than fucking morning joe or any of the cnn morning shows  you know what that means it's time to wreck the show it's working now so you know the big bosses will 
[00:59:00]  now have to destroy it that's what they do with anything that's popular i think it's directly  we are directly responsible for that uh we help jimmy uh me being on the program like that uh it just  it puts it over the top well i walk in now and i'll immediately when they say hello i'll go you're  welcome you're welcome where's my gift yeah yes for gifts i i i hint at them i resent the fact that i was  not named in this article yes as being responsible or partially so for the 50 percent jump of course i 
[00:59:30]  suggest the red eye staff get on that is that why uh gutfeld isn't doing our show anymore too big  too big for us well you know what  hard to get him out it's hard to get up that early when you got to write the show which he does  there's a reason why he's so popular it's the opian anthony show so tell me get his ass in here  thank you robert kelly fans on twitter thank you for this trout flu day six day six of the

[01:03:30]  homeless charlie instead of always just getting fired right yeah because this is this is what these  this is what you dream of you get into some crazy hot water and you ride it out i i can't wait  just uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh yes anthony you weren't you weren't here yesterday jimmy's a big fan of the  new vince vaughn movie the commercials are all over tv they were doing the hibachi 
[01:04:00]  god damn that's gonna be a bad vacation  i'm sorry man did you also see that commercial that they're just enjoying themselves in the  caribbean surf and little do they know right behind them is a shark fin out of the water  i didn't see that oh wow trouble wow tv's on behind open he'll be talking sometimes and that thing just 
[01:04:30]  pops up and i'm only human you you are i mean you enjoy a good comedy right who doesn't sure  same old hollywood shit how many times are you gonna make the same goddamn movie not enough as  far as i'm kids oh look at mary poppins what's wrong with mary poppins nothing she flies around  spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down makes the cummy taste go away that's what this song  originally was but they felt kids wouldn't understand the irony of it because mary poppins was a big seed 
[01:05:00]  guzzler and she hated that metallic aftertaste so she'd eat sugar and then she sang about it because  she had bleach breath she would say make the cummies go away the cummies go away  didn't we have a mary poppins parody song we used to play what the  was that it was the weed one oh the weed one yeah i don't think we did that one did we  no no no i i'm sure we gave credit to the person though  unlike other shows no we try to give credit 
[01:05:30]  anyway let's get into letterman because you know wherever wherever we go people are asking us  and what what's your thoughts on letterman what what's going on what do you think what do you  think wherever i went that's all i heard very important just crazy how that happens  that's a little insider for some people out there uh here we go thank you very much  did uh did your weekend just fly by 
[01:06:00]  i mean  i gotta be honest i haven't heard energy from letterman or the audience like that like that  that yeah fuck i don't want i don't know years yeah easy it's very easy to say years you hear the  energy in the audience you hear the energy from letterman he is riding this fucking thing as well 
[01:06:30]  he should yeah this has got him going he knows look he's all over the place his face has been on  fucking tv on the news we have what i've been discussing him oh fuck we got our tv back they  actually did something for us oh i didn't even notice that holy  shit we actually got something done around here pet the dog pet the dog thank you serious xm thank  you we are your future you know that now scratch under the chin uh but we have what eight tvs in 
[01:07:00]  and letterman goes away on one tv pops up on another one then it goes away over there pops up over there  it's like uh whack-a-mole whack a creep  we got frank in florida very upset frank yeah yeah how you doing frankie apologies in advance  if we upset you yes frank no problem all right he is the boss he was screwing the employees do you  think that some of those women really screwed him because they liked the way he looks or the size of 
[01:07:30]  his member he was the boss there's a big difference that's why he's a scumbag no i'll tell you why he's  not a scumbag because no one's filing sexual these were like i'm not saying he wasn't wrong to cheat  but these were not uh these were like little relationships he carried on there's a difference  between being the boss and saying here suck this and then having a relationship with someone you work  closely with i know a lot of people that know letterman and i mean for years i've been hearing  about people who i've never once heard anybody say he did anything weird with staffers like you start 
[01:08:00]  to hear that shit after a while not one fucking peep in the 20 years i'm doing comedy i understand that  but he still he still has that image of he's your boss and if there's a subtle implication that he  wants to do something with you sexually but he's as big as he was it'd be tough to say anything that  would anybody would believe first of all until he comes out with this garbage but frank he's also  very isolated he can't just go out to a singles bar right so the guy is going to kind of date 
[01:08:30]  within that inner circle women that won't talk about it yeah women that won't talk about it to  everybody like he's a very private person obviously he doesn't socialize he doesn't go to the hollywood  parties or or the new york socialite parties or or what have you so he's going to date within his own  little world which happens to be you know the staff members and also frank you know the women might be  attracted to the fact that he's the boss like he's a very powerful guy that doesn't mean he's victimizing  them maybe that's why they like him maybe because he's also funny he's a funny powerful guy who's paying 
[01:09:00]  attention to them why wouldn't they and it seems to it seems like he really liked the one the one  girl i don't know what i don't know what happened between uh letterman and stephanie but it seemed like  he really liked her yeah and maybe she was like you know i can't do this and how to move on i don't  know but i mean it really seems like it was more than just uh letterman trying to empty his bag yeah i  agree okay boys thank you frank i wouldn't say he's a scumbag for frank i'm not i mean you know 
[01:09:30]  your opinion is fine no worries ours is better yeah ours is way better worth a lot more microphones  famous more money you know by the way i just people will forget you as soon as we hang up on you have  no big deal what frank what frank i started catching on fbn this morning looking good oh good yeah support  on the fox business uh network good for fox putting them on hey why don't we have one of our tvs on that  let's take a look at imus put it on yeah we're gonna do that good idea thank you frank  how is imus how is imus on tv and this show isn't why don't we do something about that that is a 
[01:10:00]  good question not i don't mean that imus doesn't deserve to be on tv but he's not a looker how about  we should have an older gentleman in a fucking cowboy hat a lot of action goes on in this studio  no action goes on but fatso coming in doing bad characters i i've talked to our agent once  fuck the agent let's get somebody else he's not doing it once in the last two months and that was  him taking me for a nice ride in one of his vintage cars i like bob but he's not a tv guy 
[01:10:30]  we haven't even talked to the guy why why not go to manager and tell him get me on tv  bob has kind of gone away  where did he go we used to hear from him on a regular basis i think he's just hiding under his  desk hoping that the phone doesn't ring oh god oh god they need me to do something oh my god  this could fix affect my other clients oh god oh geez oh geez i don't know what to say oh oh no  they're calling me now this show he's so happy when we don't call him it should have been on tv years 
[01:11:00]  ago this show they should have been on tv years ago stop relying on bob he's not i love bob he cannot get  that done now with cable though i mean cable with uh with the with the satellite what would what  what would we do we we we curse a lot oh it's true all right good point on like the best of show  that's fucking taped and shown we get people in here and we do why not why not yeah why not let's get  back to letterman i'll be honest with you folks right now i would give anything to be hiking on the 
[01:11:30]  appalachian trail i get into the car this morning and the navigation lady wasn't speaking to me  listen to that energy and and don't don't kid yourself things are still pretty bad there's a 
[01:12:00]  possibility that i'll be the first talk show host impeached so  that's where you want to be fucking killing man yeah he's right in there people are loving this  subject loving it by the way any of the dumb asshole bosses that say just ignore it pretend it's not  happening this is what you do you talk about it because everyone's thinking why would you say that  jimmy just because the bosses are so stupid and they're such fucking worms and they they're not

[01:21:30]  you dummies yeah uh the replay promo currently running is indeed the encore version management  requested well now is that just because it hasn't been pulled and fixed yet or why why is that we will  not be running an encore presentation promo on 202 it means nothing when did it run to the listener  when did it run when you say horse shit or something like that that piques the interest  of the listener it's funny uh i think the re i think it runs like once or twice a day uh during the 
[01:22:00]  show rather but who said to actually put it like the fact that the fact the word encore is in there  stinks i hate it no none of us like it but is it possible for us it just hasn't been pulled yet  that's all no it no it was inserted it was replaced it replaced the replay promo it's not like it was  why was that why was it replaced without just being pitched and talked about what we said we  didn't like it why was it replaced look look to the because we're not in charge look to the quote  management of 202 you guys are pencil pushers okay you do what we say because we know better 
[01:22:30]  and if you think you know better than start your own fucking radio show damn it if you want to hear  it i think yeah i'd like to hear it can we hear it what do we want we want uh for something better  we were joking about the horseshit as a temporary thing let's do it four hours of horseshit again  again that's the people we're targeting and as far as well people won't get it well then we don't  want them listening because they're gonna hate the show if they don't get a horseshit joke and the  sarcasm and that they're not gonna like us so fuck them i don't learn much from other radio people 
[01:23:00]  but i'll tell you this much um eric logan and lee abrams the mad scientist guys the mad scientist  said don't make the same fucking mistakes that regular radio right encore presentation that's  boring regular radio shit you want this experience to be completely different the listeners are used  to hearing mundane promos that mean nothing but if all of a sudden you say here's four hours of  horseshit again that piques the interest like what the fuck are these guys about yep they're calling 
[01:23:30]  their show four hours of horseshit i gotta listen exactly but no that will lose people they won't  listen because they'll believe it to say encore presentation means nothing it's as boring as a  regular fucking commercial can we hear it just because it's a promo doesn't mean it's not boring  absolutely they won't get it so to the pencil pushers do what we want yeah that is your job  and you get to keep your job if you just do just that don't make me walk home with mel karmazin again 
[01:24:00]  you fucking assholes can we hear it i'll pull some fucking cards pronto hit it  it's an opie and anthony encore presentation  of the aids jokes and fart noises could you ejaculate onto my crumpets sir i'd like to pour  myself a cup of tea and have a crumpet with a shot of jism on it here's a nice piece of  shit that you might have heard before encore the article presentation is starting and i don't 
[01:24:30]  have a fat retarded girl to throw rocks at i like it i've been won over listen it's tough to admit  when you're wrong but all right listen i don't mind that jimmy doesn't mind and anthony obviously  doesn't mind it yeah i thought it was something else huh i thought it was something else yeah that  was a funny promo no if you do encore presentation dry it sucks a fucking dick right so what i suggest  is you do a little that encore thing like you just heard that's perfect it is perfect 
[01:25:00]  fuck you pencil pushers knowing a little more than i today and then we also do horseshit as well how  about a little combination platter but wait is that what they wanted danny or is that just what we did  sarcastically i'm not sure if that actually ever ran that should i don't know if that one ever ran  but actually the one that ran on friday actually did say horseshit in it if you want to hear that one  i also have that okay let's hear that let's hear the horseshit one  i have like four mouses in here i'm sorry oh stop they're called mice you're listening

[01:29:30]  phase two next week i go on oprah and sob  phase two  oh it's fucking sorry sorry we just listened there but that's just a solid home run on letterman's  part that's the funniest monologue i've ever heard him do that is  fucking great that was really really stop that whatsoever uh  well i mean we could get into the serious stuff  with letterman yeah definitely that's what i wanted to hear actually okay i'd love to hear that 
[01:30:00]  last week uh on the the show i told a little story about being blackmailed  blackmailed and uh i wasn't going to talk about it anymore but uh it seems like people want to talk  about it  um and and and and when you're uh uh blackmailed it's it's a crime and you're a victim it's a  it's felony extortion is what it is and it's it's a nasty thing to to do to people now being a victim  and if you happen to your behavior uh is responsible for hurting people that's a separate part of the 
[01:30:30]  equation and and it did not occur to me last week when i was discussing uh having had sex with uh  women who worked on this show that then what would happen is uh reporters and uh newspaper people and  radio and tv would start uh hounding the staff and saying what do you say are you and this and that  it was very very unpleasant and i would just like to set the record straight no i'm not having sex with 
[01:31:00]  these women uh those episodes are in in the past so my apologies to uh subjecting them to that  vulnerability and being a brow beaten and humiliated i it never occurred to me and as a matter of fact  alan coulter kept wanting to know if we'd had sex didn't you remember that alan i did i did and i don't  remember yeah he comes right out in simple plain language yeah had sex with those staffers he didn't 
[01:31:30]  say had engaged in ambiguous the best thing he could have done i i fucking really have a tremendous  amount of respect for him even even more so i did after the the palin thing i like the way he handled  yeah and then this plain simple language completely diffused everything everything  yeah always knows how to handle this uh this tough stuff he's honest about it his 9 11 stuff was great  the sarah palin stuff was great when carson uh when johnny died he was great yeah man let him when 
[01:32:00]  he was dealing with his uh open heart surgery yeah right he always does very well when it comes to the  serious shit and he apologized to his wife too i want to hear that do we have that i'll just say  i'm terribly sorry that i put the staff in uh that position inadvertently i just wasn't thinking  ahead and moreover uh the staff here has been uh wonderfully supportive to me not not just uh  through this furor but uh through all the years that that we've been on television and especially 
[01:32:30]  all the years here at cbs so again my thanks to the staff for once again uh putting up with something  stupid i'm getting myself involved in uh now the other thing is uh my wife regina uh she has been  horribly uh hurt uh by my behavior and when when something happens like that if you if you hurt a  person and it's your responsibility you try to fix it and at that point there's only two things that  can happen either you're going to make some progress and get it fixed or you're going to fall short and  perhaps not get it fixed so let me tell you folks i get my work cut out for me and 
[01:33:00]  wow he's admitting that this might be really really bad for his marriage well they were going  out for a long time you know obviously he wasn't married when this was happening but he was you  know going out with her and well if the diary said that like last fall she went out to and that's  what i quoted either in the post of daily news is she went out there last fall while she was dating  halderman and and was still hooking up with him and he was that if that's true wait the diary's 
[01:33:30]  saying that in the paper that's what that's what the impression i got from reading is that it was  saying that while she went out there last fall while halderman was staying home and worried he was  worried like i don't want you going out there and she's like no we're best friends uh again that's  kind of what the implication was wow all right i think wow and then letterman still thinks what he did  was right i guess we don't have to play that clip today we're gonna take a break  when we get back um some jocktober stuff come on jocktober i want to hear uh the show what was it 
[01:34:00]  again uh well we'll tell you after the break making a surprise for people right and let us know i guess  where's mars i don't know i'm hiding not that i don't know um also lewis black talking about  letterman it's really funny really our friend lewis black had a nice nice minute and a half on  uh cnn about the letterman stuff we'll give that to you i don't know why we are looking at this 
[01:34:30]  i didn't hear lois pointing it's insanity yeah are we crazy we'll get to it a little later it looks  like that's why he's not a politician he's not an elected official  just pointing at the air i love lewis i do love lewis  crazy  if you if you read a transcript of what lewis said you would realize he has no idea what 
[01:35:00]  he's talking about no no he's insane lewis is just a fool  the media is that it's all they talk about that we have health care is are they crazy  are they insane to re-elect the rhododendron it's like what what are you talking about  i have sex with staffers  the president is afghanistan  are he's insane 
[01:35:30]  oh you fucker now we gotta play it i'm just guessing i don't know what he's gonna say i  haven't heard it we're gonna play it cigars and scotch uh dominic barbara  breaking news is camping outside letterman's house  yeah  that news has just gotten great  i'm literally forgetting  you know my take on letterman is this is simple all it does  any way shape or form you show how immature this country was this when it comes thanks for nothing 
[01:36:00]  lewis thanks for having like a real a salient point and being fuck it this is the first time  i know lewis for almost 15 years i've never heard this tone before he's uh talking very nicely  well thought out nothing like your impression of god damn the thought of him  how immature this country is when it comes to our sexuality it's like a continuous it's been  it's been a running theme in my life it's the theme like when i talk about in the show about 
[01:36:30]  getting older that it's the same argument so never again we are  he when you slept with somebody it's like nine-year-olds you can't you know it's like he came out he  told you that's it case closed you need you don't need to write anymore whether you think he is  right or wrong it's not you what are you are you a priest idiots you don't make a judgment call he's 
[01:37:00]  he he had sex oh god you know he didn't have sex on tv privately and the only reason it had to come  out is because some idiot tried to make money off of it that's the story he is not the story i'm tired  of it and that and that cnn ought to learn that lesson occasionally and msnbc and nbc and the rest  of them and just because they think that creates a bunch of people watching is by creating another 
[01:37:30]  story where the real story is is bull and if you want people to watch it get john and kate to discuss  it all right those two pieces excuse me wow you don't give a anymore i know i don't care that my  impression was wrong yeah god damn it it's good i've never heard lewis be soft spoke he did that  to embarrass me and a job well done my throat hurts actually for that lewis impression well why don't you 
[01:38:00]  sip some tea with some honey as we take a break here jimmy what am i crazy i'm insane  we come back with jocktober stay there okie dokie  hey anthony it's time for jocktober sam's in studio jacktober let me make it official first here  happy jocktober everybody from your friends at the opie and anthony show one third of the women polled  said they do this right after a breakup my guess is tickle their clit with a rake it's a

[01:51:00]  blade out and just cut your throat she looks like a prison bitch right yeah and you don't mess with  those prison bitches i know look at them hips though right just grab them the thing is is that  we are uh actually supposed to be broadcasting live from my house today and uh you know i don't like to  do things that are against the uh the way of the norm because that's a way for them to get out of their  contract with me and they'll throw me out of the building instantly and send me on my way yeah 
[01:51:30]  they're waiting for some all right so they can't get it so i'm not gonna send them so i i i you know  put the uh approval form to take the show live out on the streets i gave it to the boss last week i  said hey man sign this give it back to me when you're done with it let me know man he seemed like  he was okay with it i mean he did but all week went by and then on friday it's like he had a bunch  of stuff to do and i couldn't like link up with the boss and we had to go out of town so i didn't have  the okay i called him during sunday football no nothing all right so here's what i decided 
[01:52:00]  what's the boss's extension two one five three all right let's call his ass this is how you know  you're not gonna mess with this show wow they're not afraid to call the boss on the air and say hey  wait why did they need what was there you see saying what happened problem this he's very uh wordy  it's national work from home week he said yeah so he wants to broadcast the show from his house  why why because you didn't hear me no i did hear it's national trust me for once i was listening okay 
[01:52:30]  i still ask why just could you change that i think makes me want to buy new luggage oh jesus jesus thanks  what i just said change that yeah i don't want new luggage yeah sam old luggage just thrown around  and treated badly you want to get new luggage yes i don't want it he wants to broadcast from home  that's he works as a broadcaster so he wants to move the show home to his house who wouldn't but 
[01:53:00]  management never signed the paperwork but if they were voted most popular show why are they waiting to  throw him out of the building in less than a year yeah it doesn't make sense make sense sam  mm well i mean i think it's because he's so edgy that they're like look even with the ratings this  guy has he's turning into a liability i think trouble's gonna happen soon yeah yeah oh yeah he  sounds it yeah you can tell did you could you hear the gruffness in his voice yeah that's natural 
[01:53:30]  so i guess uh he's here comes the bit he's gonna call oh i know he set it up so here  comes the bit sam there's no way that this could be unexciting  hello hello hello it's big mama hey what's up man hey uh we're supposed to be broadcasting live  from uh my house this week for uh national state uh work from home week yeah and i sent you that  form and you never gave back to us we want to know what's the deal dude i put it under your door

[01:54:30]  stir things up a little bit we know a thing or two about that right sam oh yeah i remember the  time you guys stole that aerosmith cd i do think that was a real call to management though because  that was so awful you yeah that was actual call i think i think the idea was he was going to stir 
[01:55:00]  some stuff up but uh the whole plan completely fired because it was not he said yeah it's in your  office just look so there was no reason for that last five minutes of radio exactly but  he decided no we have this topic penciled in for the next two breaks so we can't stop this we have  to we have to play some songs and then come back and talk some more about keep it going exactly where  does this end up where does this tale go next uh uh only a mad getting a lot more info on this uh

[02:01:30]  you're into country or mexican or old people a lot of christian and mexican stations so there is a  lot of competition there's 99x those guys are pretty funny but all right thank you david good  job uh i'm very excited because this is the bit we teased yesterday the perez hilton call that's  right because i'll listen to this ad you guys can make fun of uh of big mama and the wild bunch all  you want and say they're from a little town but if estero was such a non-issue of a town uh-huh 
[02:02:00]  would perez hilton come to visit wow you're kidding me that's right perez hilton you don't get perez  hilton because you're not as big as this show out of estero is and perez hilton comes in i believe  weekly to deliver the gossip to the wild bunch and uh now how does perez hilton get down there every  week every week that's crazy it's worth the trip because this show is so big i guess so wow maybe we're 
[02:02:30]  mistaken all this it's b103.9 all right we're back uh back 651 here big mom of the wild bunch  all right uh here's what we got going on right now it's uh exhausting well it really is perez standing  by bothering me looking at me through the window right now go take care of me yeah will you take  get away go away all right there we go looking they don't get along yeah that's what happens when 
[02:03:00]  you get uh two queens yeah two two force fires battling it out you know the gay guy didn't like  the perez hilton oh was jealous was staring in it was physically there and staring into the studio  window studio yeah yeah so gay guys don't get along with each other i guess that's correct they don't  bond over the fact that they both enjoy the same set of genitals yeah no they don't wink at each  other lovely cock inside each other's mouths all we could all we could all we could over explain is 
[02:03:30]  that's what i was thinking exactly those words  i love it uh people are making ester roll jokes now so oh you know right yes uh well let's listen to 
[02:04:00]  perez hilton live in their studio that's that's a big get well yeah i figured i'd bring in the  audio so you could clearly hear that perez hilton is sitting in studio with them and this is not some  kind of produced piece that is sent out to dozens of stations no it is live uh obviously right because  so you just yelled at him exactly okay and you can hear here's perez  it's world war three between john and kate gosling 
[02:04:30]  john has withdrawn a massive amount of money i'm talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars  from him and guys a horrible broadcaster he doesn't have a good voice just say go to my website  the fact that anybody would buy this assholes fucking podcast or whatever it is  knowing is that but the thing is he's supposed to be in studio where's the hello yeah thanks for  coming in and why is the music playing where's the fucking rivalry like why does he go to the 
[02:05:00]  gay guy why did you just yell at me yeah yeah what happened believe it or not knowledge the show  that is the first uh piece of audio from perez hilton after that uh outcry perez doesn't even  acknowledge that he was just scolded so maybe that's weird if maybe he's really mad he might  really be mad why wouldn't he say hi yeah yeah i don't know it's also amazing they're really good  with the sweepers and the production the way perez knows when to stop right on time so you can get  the sweeper right in and then it can come right after i didn't notice that yes fantastic yeah it's

[02:10:00]  it's it's it's he's responding no one can see the visual he's responding to  and it's a 1971 death reference  and it just makes me laugh  how perfect  just spilling it  just spilling it  just connecting those things really just struck me as very funny  that's the only  you know i didn't even realize that yeah we're doing a radio show no one can see that they can't get the reference no only jimmy is looking at it and gets yeah it's like he's spilling one time soon we need a true video element to the show how great would it be if the listeners could see anthony doing that impression as he's watching the video and you can see the video he's referring to struck me as very very silly it's a no-brainer let's get this done 
[02:10:30]  um we're just about done with this show there sam we're in the middle of the perez hilton thing i hope  the virus is standing by  he better be he knows he knows he got some material right  good he was writing  world war three between john and kate gosling 
[02:11:00]  john has withdrawn a massive amount of money i'm talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars from  him and kate's joint bank accounts leaving kate with a meager one thousand dollars to survive on  kate has apparently lawyered up and the lawyers have sent john a letter demanding he return the  family's hard-earned money immediately john gosling is a moron  what a fucking bore 
[02:11:30]  pretty brave too he's a moron he wants attention so bad  i fucking hate him he's such a jizz bag so this show  like actually said you know we need that entertainment element on here can we get perez  hilton uh does he do something where he like does a daily rundown and we buy it along with  other stations i think probably perez hilton's people put out a thing saying hey perez is now  doing radio and your station can have perez hilton and so the management of that station said this is 
[02:12:00]  exactly what big mama and the wild bunch need and they can pretend to talk to him yeah yeah yeah  and the good thing for perez hilton he makes all the stations compete because he'll only do one per  market you can only do one per market and they don't even do it right where it seems like they're  interacting like i was explaining yesterday at the fake uh celebrity interview i love them where  they already give you the answers uh that this the celebrity is going to answer a bunch of questions  so what do you uh feel about the character that you're playing in this next movie uh the character 
[02:12:30]  i'm playing in this next movie really and you're supposed to believe that yeah you're actually  you're chit-chatting the host is actually talking to the do we have audio of one of those i wanted  audio that i actually do we have any i'm working on uh getting passwords back for the prep where's  the virus i think we wrap up today's jocktober with a an appearance by our new morning show character  the virus there's a great celebrity interview by the way that's going to be played on this show  soon what i'm not telling you surprise all right and uh the virus what does it do jimmy uh bc spreads uh

[02:35:30]  uh barbara walters and and uh joy behar going at it over the letterman controversy lesbian style  or just yeah they're looking at uh twats live on abc licking some blocks i knew they would put  that table to good use eventually just fucking oh god the scene that would be you imagine they  just pin down they just pin down babs and everyone gets a lick oh gets a lick at the  no they make babs do the licking really yeah i think it'd be like yeah i think it'd be better 
[02:36:00]  to watch her old pussy get licked watching the girls going  like a big gray curly snaggly one comes out  like the grape seed  do you like the virus oh who couldn't it's great we weren't sure yesterday  no he was amusing us we knew that much that is virus-rific that is a home run 
[02:36:30]  what all right it is fat it is stupid  it is always here  all right we're going to break uh jimmy fallon had a quick one about letterman we go to break  with this there's a new book out called why women have sex that has a list of 237 reasons why  women have sex and letterman knows the top 10  what else is going on today let me look around 
[02:37:00]  are you perfect  rock  yankees lowering their uh ticket prices huh for next year oh yeah speaking of uh  trying to get more people in the seats what happened there people weren't buying the big uh  the big uh the big the big seats yeah i think it's like you know uh uh hard economic times and 
[02:37:30]  i have no idea i'm sure it's a money-making play on their part um they dropped some seats by as  much as one thousand dollars wow yeah i think those are the right that's just ridiculous paying  that much money for a baseball game and that was for any sporting event those are for seats in the  old yankee stadium so it's really hard to see the game uh by the way um playoffs uh anthony  needs will uh now get uh playoff tickets i would accept playoff tickets um from this organization 
[02:38:00]  serious uh xm satellite radio because i remember when i wanted tickets for uh that game a couple weeks  ago uh they said look we can't get regular season tickets we can only get playoff tickets they did  say and then they and then somebody came through thank god with the regular season tickets but now  the playoffs anthony wants to go to the stadium see some playoff games uh i think it's good for the  show of course that that is the first and foremost thing i wouldn't do this for just me i wouldn't do 
[02:38:30]  this just so i could selfishly go to a yankee  what this would be  is me  going to the yankee game so i could come in the next day and give a first hand  eyewitness account of uh the yankees in the playoff 
[02:39:00]  as a matter of fact i'm not even thinking of myself in this situation  not even thinking of myself  just want i just want yankee playoff tickets but not for me like selfishly for the show so i can come  in the next day and uh talk about the games uh you know it's it's just uh one of those things  that i think would be great for the show and i would have to sacrifice my time and actually 
[02:39:30]  go to the game you know spend money on the beers and the hot dogs and stuff sit there and watch the  game and then come in here and and and talk about it but uh so uh anyone listening get it from the  organization anthony yankee playoff tickets you know thank you while we're at it now that i uh  decided i liked football this year yeah i want some jet tickets and some jet tickets yeah see that 
[02:40:00]  proves he doesn't know much about sports he admitted on the air today shut up once again shut up  yeah i like football a little more this year than past years yes that's true what happened to sanchez  uh uh well you know a lot of turnovers well you know he's a rookie yeah he was very upset with  himself you could say well you know rex ryan thinks it's a nice little learning experience for  the young fella it's good to get that loss out of the way though and if you're gonna lose you should 
[02:40:30]  lose in that way yeah because then you could sleep a little better and you're all right a little  better you know as long as they pick it up next week and you know well i was listening to serious  next time i said this uh yesterday driving back from philly yeah and the one guy i don't know what  his name was he he described it perfectly he goes there's only one way to describe this he got punched  in the face today yeah finally got punched in the face oh he had some big mistakes that's a good one  and uh look i'm not stupid i was trash talking but the saints are a better football team yes they 
[02:41:00]  were running all over him and plus it was at home for the saints and you know they're  powerhouse he could not fucking he's throwing the ball right at him here you go yard interception  you go take this with you and then big blue did very good they did very good i know you don't like  the giants and eli saying that he's gonna play hurt or something he's got some weird fucking yeah his  foot he's got uh an inflamed they did an mri he's got like an inflamed uh ankle or something i think it's  underneath isn't it yeah yeah they said he can play with it as long as he can stand the pain

[02:43:30]  fucking play stop playing we're a baseball team now okay home opener we play the penguins tough  we uh we uh we outplayed ourselves there yeah we outplayed the penguins for two periods and then  we couldn't hold them back and just lost it well no i mean we get a point because the game ended in  a tie and then we lose in the shootout anthony so you still get a point that shootout now that i  think about it i fucking hate it but you were digging the shootout at first i loved it yeah  because i kind of saw it in the playoffs and that was so exciting but now it's like for these guys to 
[02:44:00]  just scrap for three periods and then a five minute overtime and then they just then it's just a dumb  shootout like i hate it now yeah why not play another five minute overtime you're spending five  minutes doing the shootout basically so just do another five minute overtime let them all skate  and they they should just keep taking players off the off the ice until it's decided oh that's pretty  good imagine that now it's just down to two guys on each side and a goalie a big hook comes out and  just grabs them how great would that be you would see some great skating do something different that 
[02:44:30]  that shootout i've i've changed my mind i hate it don't like it i fucking hate it am well we're like  a fucking sports show now well bcn should have kept us and the and uh the islanders might be moving  yes those fucking politicians can't figure it out so uh the islanders owners is starting to you know  take some phone calls from other people that might be interested in the team there was something in the  paper today they might maybe move them to queens put a little stadium right next to the city field 
[02:45:00]  there try to make them a little more uh city than uh long island well they would just keep them on the  island please they do have that rep of just being the old white trash mullet fucking long island team  it's embarrassing going to an islander home game yeah it's fucking embarrassing because i you know i  got a lot of friends in philly so i get to go to some flyers games uh the fucking devils have an  amazing arena right over the water here right over the river and and their uh and their and their 
[02:45:30]  presentation is just great yeah it's all fucking lights and lasers and fucking hot chicks and  and and and the islanders it's like watching minor league hockey or something fire hazard it's  horrendous it's embarrassing it really is it's like that place in comac now where they used to  do the flea market all right the old comac arena piece of shit oh yeah there's no uh shootouts in the  playoffs i'm sorry no yeah it's it's the trout flow bill i'm sorry yeah that'll give up something 
[02:46:00]  people something to talk about for the next fucking three days there you go just enjoy the  fucking show don't sweat the details i actually went on a website i was like oh wow look at this  really nice positive thread and then within three posts it was like why they hate life i'm like jesus  all right i'll check you guys out in another month or so yeah yeah enough three posts i'm  surprised it took that long it's just amazing someone could go on there and go you know i cured 
[02:46:30]  cancer and then within three posts it's it's why this guy's a fucking asshole and needs to be fisted and  thanks for doing it now and not a year ago when maybe my father could use or something like that  every fucking time hey i did it to myself but by the way we missed a huge story so far what happened  with ted williams we're getting to the oh yeah we know we have it okay we do have it hey wait a  minute is that story we did i don't know is there more to it what was the story we did you might 
[02:47:00]  have been gone but where they were fucking messing with his head oh you did that right okay i thought  it just happened yesterday okay okay story i didn't make sense that we wouldn't have talked about  oh yeah okay it must have been last week we did in depth we did okay we did at least three minutes  on that jimmy oh come on more than that no here's lady gaga cursing on snl  baby  With us in the studio 
[02:47:30]  To that shit on the radio  Don't stop for anyone  Wow, and these...  What a song. Who gives a fuck?  But more importantly, when you have to sing live, wow.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  You don't like the Lady Gaga singing live?  I don't really like her in general, but you can at least understand that  it sounds like a pop song when you hear it on the radio.  That's her before she got all Gaga'd.  That's Lady Gaga before she got gone?  And she was just Stephanie. 
[02:48:00]  Just little old Stephanie.  You know where she used to perform, Jimmy?  Mm-mm.  Cafe Wa.  Did she really?  Cafe Wa.  She's probably into the cellar then.  Cafe Wa is pretty much right next door to the economy cellar.  It's a great place to check out some local live music.  They do a very good job down there.  She looked a lot better before she fucked her face up.  Yeah, what happened?  She sucks on every level.  Yeah, you don't like the Lady Gaga?  Did you hear that song?  That's her actually singing.  Yeah.  There's no talent there.  But I don't know what...  You know something?  I'm looking at Lady Gaga.  She's a product of the studio. 
[02:48:30]  I guess that's pre-fucking Gaga, right?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  I mean...  Look over there.  She's a little weird-looking, but it's kind of one of those...  I don't know what to make of her.  Look up there.  I don't...  Yeah, okay.  That's a weird kind of angle, and the hat is not good.  It's the fedora.  She's wearing a fucking American Express Don't Leave Home Without It hat.  Carl Malden's hat.  She's got Carl Malden's hat on. 
[02:49:00]  They did a whole article on the fedora over the weekend.  Oh, really?  And how it's making a huge comeback.  Is it?  And now it's everywhere.  Why?  I don't know.  All right, what do you want?  The View?  The Coons?  I don't know what to make of this Gaga.  Let's do The View.  The View.  The View Girls.  Because this Letterman thing is really hot.  It is.  And, well, the girls, you know, were thinking they would have a little fun with this whole  fucking thing, and Barbara Walters had to, like, stick her fucking head into it and get 
[02:49:30]  involved, because she has a personal relationship with Letterman.  Oh, true.  How personal.  But it's okay when, you know, you guys talk about everybody else.  Has she been up in the room?  That personal?  The room.  The secret room.  I guess she's a world-class piano player.  Is she really?  From Wackbag is saying, all right.  Who?  The Gaga.  Oh, I'm seeing her right now playing some keyboards.  The Gaga.  She's got the dark hair.  She looks like she's in some real shithole club. 
[02:50:00]  That might be Cafe Wa.  Let me see the picture.  She's got some pink fishnets on.  Let me see it.  And it's not, you know something?  I like the older version of the Gaga.  With the darker hair and stuff?  Yeah, there's just something about, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And there's some sweaty bitch behind her.  That's nice.  Let's go to the view.  Sweaty stage whores.  This is how the girls handled the Letterman thing. 
[02:50:30]  First track, whatever.  Second track is pretty good.  As I said, I can give you a list of executives and people in lower levels.  You know, where do you meet people?  In the workplace.  Yeah, but that does not eliminate the fact that if you're one of the girls who works there and you're just, you know, doing your job and suddenly this other chick is getting the airtime and getting the after checks and going out there and getting hurt.  Maybe you're annoyed today, but that's not necessarily sexual harassment.  Well, no, that's not necessarily true because I think the definition also includes creating an atmosphere that's uncomfortable. 
[02:51:00]  And so these other girls might have been very uncomfortable.  Wow.  I'm surprised Joy would take that angle, huh?  Ugh.  An atmosphere that's uncomfortable.  Shut up.  I'm really surprised she would take that angle, Joy Behar.  Atmosphere that's uncomfortable.  What's the uncomfortable fucking atmosphere?  No, no.  I can't stand the fact that the workplace has become like that.  The workplace is...  Atmosphere that's uncomfortable.  Just getting up is uncomfortable.  Shut up. 
[02:51:30]  As soon as you fucking put your badge on that thing and it goes beep.  Meaning time for work.  It's uncomfortable.  There's lack of comfort.  What is comfortable about work at this point?  It used to be a great place.  You couldn't wait to go to work in some cases because it was like a fucking nightclub.  You're flirting with the skirts.  You're gambling on the big...  Smoking.  The big games.  You're smoking.  Smoking, drinking, sucking, fucking.  Right in your cubicle.  Get by the water cooler.  Talk about how you're going to Xerox your asses.  Yeah, you got calendars with girls in bikinis. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Now, as soon as you walk in, it's uncomfortable.  What are they talking about?  What's comfortable about it?  What is comfortable about work, Anthony?  Go.  Let me think.  Think regular job.  Regular job.  I'm not talking here because here is, like, ridiculous.  It's still fun.  You know, you just come here.  Yeah, it's all right.  Management gets on your ass every so often.  But for the most part, we're just sitting in here a jabber-jawing and having a good time.  A jabber-jawing.  But regular workplace, what's fun?  What's comfortable about it, Anthony? 
[02:52:30]  What's comfortable?  You go in.  You're scared that someone's going to fucking...  You're constantly under the gun.  You go to your cubicle, and you start typing out things on your keyboard.  Maybe you could post something or tack up something fun in your cubicle that you can look...  That's right.  You can't do that.  All right.  And during your downtime, don't check that Facebook.  They're watching you.  No, no.  They'll watch that, too.  Don't fucking do any Twittering on your office computer.  What about forwarding funny emails of a joke that might... 
[02:53:00]  No, no, can't do that.  That's right.  Most of the places are going with the glass offices, so they can really watch you.  Yeah.  So you can't even hide in your own office anymore.  Yeah.  How about...  What's really fun?  For real.  Pulling a tub girl in your cubicle.  Like a half a handstand and diarrhea fucking fountain.  The workplace sucks.  Yes, it does.  There's nothing.  I don't know how we allowed this to happen as working people. 
[02:53:30]  Joy Bayhardt saying that.  We allowed this to happen.  Saying, like, it creates an uncomfortable workplace.  You know, no one...  It's another thing that isn't guaranteed.  You're not guaranteed comfort.  You're not guaranteed comfort when you go to work.  Bunch of fucking babies we've turned into.  Just what a bunch of fags.  Comfort.  I'm not comfortable.  You're at work.  Right.  You're not supposed to be.  Right.  Look at the guy working a jackhammer on the sidewalk.  Does that look comfortable? 
[02:54:00]  Right.  There's no harassment.  No fucking shit going on there.  But that motherfucker is uncomfortable.  Yeah.  You think that shaking goes away when he goes home?  That's all he hears in his head.  Fucking...  Like he's got Parkinson's when he goes home.  Yeah.  And somebody sees something they don't like or hears something.  Or maybe the boss is fucking another girl in the office.  Yeah.  And not you.  Right.  Oh, it's uncomfortable.  Who gives a shit?  Do your job.  Get your pay.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:54:30]  There's nothing in there that said you're guaranteed to be comfortable.  Guaranteed the boss is going to fuck you.  Unless, you know...  Everyone needs to suckle off the teat.  Figuratively fucking.  Everyone has to suck the teat.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone wants the fucking...  Everyone needs that comfort.  Or the attention.  Or that you made a difference.  That's the biggest thing.  I made a difference.  I've made it better for the next person that comes in here in my position to come in to a more comfortable workplace.  Really?  You made it better? 
[02:55:00]  No, you made it fucking shitty for everyone.  Watch About Schmidt.  One of my favorite movies.  See how much better it is when all your crap goes in the dumpster out back as you're trying to fucking give words of wisdom to the new guy.  And all your shit is in the dumpster, Mr. Gold fucking Watch.  Because they don't need the likes of you anymore.  Get the fuck out of here with your comfortable workplace.  That About Schmidt stuff happens to every single one of us.  You think you're important at work?  It'll happen to us.  It'll happen to everybody.  Of course it does.  Your shit will be in a dumpster. 
[02:55:30]  I'm tired of hearing it, though.  Oh, it's all the time.  Someone's fucking suing this one.  This boss is in trouble.  They're not even a boss.  Sometimes it's just some poor other scrub at work.  Might have looked two seconds too long at a girl's ass.  That's, you know, she's got a painted on fucking skirt.  Yeah.  And you take a look at it, and you're the asshole.  She's got her tits fucking hanging out.  You look one second too long, you're fucking going down to HR.  Hell yeah. 
[02:56:00]  What a load of shit.  Yep.  I'm being accused of watching Mad Men.  I know I should be watching that show.  I have not watched it.  Never seen it either.  I have not watched it.  I just remember from my dumb experience that there was a time that you kind of enjoyed going  to work.  It was still work, but you're like, you know what?  I get some things done.  I had a job where we got to play ping pong.  Wow.  That's a good job.  Fuck yeah, it was.  I had a job where we could play foosball.  Yeah.  Oh wait, that was radio.  That was radio. 
[02:56:30]  No, I was in shipping and receiving for Xerox up in Rochester, New York, and in between waiting  for the loads to come in.  Loads.  Or the loads to go out.  We got to play ping pong and flirt.  And one of the chicks had fucking booze.  This load of Xerox paper over those boys at IBM.  What are you doing, Mr. Hughes?  You put on that Xerox uniform.  Everybody was sucking and fucking fucking fuck.  Well, the Barbara Walters thing continues with this. 
[02:57:00]  A little back and forth between the gals.  I would like to say, just before we go, because I just want us to stick to the fact that nobody  says that David Letterman, you know, that you didn't get a job because you didn't do  this or that with him.  Nobody has claimed sexual harassment.  We do not know if something's going to come out, but let's stick to the fact.  What about the woman that he's married to now?  She was going out with him during that whole period.  Well, that's their private business.  That's not your business or my business.  And she was not married to him. 
[02:57:30]  Ninety-nine out of a hundred things I talk about on this show are none of my business.  But you can talk about it.  She's not complaining.  We don't know that she's not complaining.  A lot of it is about public relations, too, Barbara.  So a lot of women out there could be identifying with this particular woman and not think it's  so great to watch Letterman.  I mean, it's possible that he's hurt himself in the industry a little bit.  I love us the fact that if he goes down, so does his whole staff. 
[02:58:00]  In a way, that's the end of the show.  So it's very reckless behavior.  That's all.  Absolutely.  And I'm never on his show anyway.  So if you were on his show, you wouldn't be going,  Yes, I would.  I'm really surprised that she took that angle.  First of all, it's not.  I'm really surprised Joy took that angle.  It's not hurting Dave.  Believe me, his ratings are going to be through the roof.  If his demo isn't necessarily that of women that are going to be offended by this kind  of behavior, that's another thing.  You've got to think it's more men, right? 
[02:58:30]  I think it's more guys.  25, 54, somewhere around there.  And I think girls that are going to be offended by this aren't really watching David Letterman.  I don't think so.  I agree with you.  And the fact that, you know, no girls are stepping up and saying that anyone was promoted  or demoted or anything for fucking him or not fucking him.  They're not even saying nasty things about Letterman.  I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of women that don't work for the show anymore for whatever  reason.  Yeah.  They're not stepping forward and saying, yeah, thank God this is finally coming out. 
[02:59:00]  He's such a pig.  He's this.  He's that.  It's a guy that wanted to have some sex, found some girls at work willing to have some  sex and had some sex.  I think.  What the fuck?  I think.  I don't think it was just that, though.  I think Letterman, he did like these women.  He just didn't want to settle down with.  No, no.  I understand that.  I think they're portraying it like he went up to that secret room.  God, I want to see the secret room.  I'm dying to see the secret room.  See that secret room.  You think it's just nothing but porno and no screen TV. 
[02:59:30]  Spring mattress on the floor.  All you hear is and just condom wrappers and fucking enemas.  Do sex toys talk about?  Yes, sex toys.  A top ten list, you know, because you got to study things.  No, it sounds like.  Oh, he does do them.  Yes.  That's right, he does.  Literal Jim.  Literal Jim.  But he liked these women more than just like, you know, just banging. 
[03:00:00]  I wonder how many there were.  That's probably.  Over the years.  The two have come out, maybe, maybe a couple more, right?  Yeah.  But so far, no one's coming out and saying what a pig he is.  Oh.  And the one girl goes, I would have married the guy.  Wow.  We had a nice relationship.  And Dave broke it up probably because he saw something else he liked.  But basically saying, you know, he was worried about the age difference.  Or maybe she was getting too close and he had that, his woman who eventually was going to marry.  And he's like, I love this one.  I'm just playing around.  Yeah, but he seemed to, he seems to really like this other one, the main one. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Because like you said earlier, Jimmy, she went to Montana hiking last year, right?  Montana.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  What?  I just asked him a question.  It's all right.  What?  I'm sorry.  What's your question?  It's all right.  Tell us.  It's just horseshit in the end.  Who cares?  Oh, lady trucker wants in.  Of course.  And what?  Fucking cage. 
[03:01:00]  Lady.  Monster.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How would you guys like to be sexually harassed by me?  Day in, day out.  Hey, sweetie.  You want some work?  Yeah, but I wouldn't go to HR.  I would handle it myself.  I'd punch you in the cunt.  I'd say, no, listen, you fucking monster.  I don't want to fuck you.  That's what I'd say.  Right.  Yeah, but I own the company, so you're out of work.  I'm going to go get some other stuff.  Then I get another job somewhere.  What are you going to do, you know?  Yeah, everyone's got to stop thinking their job is that special. 
[03:01:30]  We could all get another job.  I'll say, all right, I'll throw you a fucking, but you've got to triple my salary, you fucking  elephant.  I wouldn't be that mean to you.  I'd probably say, no, thank you.  I'd prefer if we kept it at a professional level.  Oh, you're such a sweet boy, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right, LT.  Thank you.  There goes LT.  I'll get hurt walking through the Midtown Tunnel.  So, let's say hi to Rob in New York.  Rob?  Yeah.  Circus.  Morning, boys.  Hey. 
[03:02:00]  The two best examples of workplace elegance, I think, happens in Boiler Room, but most importantly,  Alec Baldwin and Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  Oh, my God.  You want to talk about, hey, the winner gets Cadillac, the loser gets steak knives, and if you don't  make any sales, fuck you, you're fired.  Yeah.  Oof.  Yeah, they didn't hold back.  You got that right.  Damn skippy.  That's right.  That's work.  That's work.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:02:30]  I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  Albany, John, what's up?  Hey, I'm going back to how shitty the workplace is.  I got reprimanded a couple weeks ago.  Oh, what happened?  I wore a Vic jersey on dress down day, but all the black folks loved it.  So, why are you getting reprimanded, because you're wearing a Vic jersey?  Because the dogs were defenseless.  Ah, God, what happened?  Wait, did he get reprimanded, or people's own, just personal opinions? 
[03:03:00]  Well, all the upper level people told me I shouldn't wear it anymore.  Ah, what are they doing?  Nike taking them?  I don't know.  Huh?  I read that Nike took them back.  Nike took them back.  He got an endorsement.  Thank you, John.  Are they taking some heat?  I'm surprised that they, I thought they'd wait just a little longer.  You know, that's a ballsy move.  I like that on Nike's part.  I believe, yeah, he signed a new endorsement deal with Nike.  What happened?  I thought Danny was shaking his head no.  Well, it says here, I'm just looking for some info on that. 
[03:03:30]  It just says here, Nike says that Vic is not under contract.  A company said it merely provided the Eagles quarterback with shoes and gear, and that is all.  Well, that's kind of an endorsement.  That's kind of an endorsement.  Now you're at home, and you're seeing Michael Vick, you know, running around with the Nike logo.  Yeah, this is their way to ease into it and see how it goes.  They're testing the waters.  They're smart.  Yeah.  It was reported that it was an endorsement deal, but all right.  Well, maybe they did.  Come on.  Maybe they did catch some shit and decided to say, well, we just gave him some gear. 
[03:04:00]  We gave him some free gear and some free money, but he's not under contract.  Amazing.  Justin.  Let's go to Justin in California.  Justin.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hi.  I just want to say I've never appreciated the workplace being like this because I actually,  when I got out of college, I came home and I run my family's cattle ranch here in California.  Like, I literally just finished telling the cowboys what to do today while they were studying 
[03:04:30]  on their horses.  Like, maybe these guys have problems.  Maybe they don't.  But they just sort it out.  We don't have an HR, and there's no need for one.  This call coming from the past?  Yeah, I know.  It's weird.  It's crazy.  On the other side of things, though, my wife teaches college as a math teacher, and to hear  the bureaucracy at a school and the liberal ridiculousness, like, it is like a time machine.  I can't even believe it.  Well, when radio got the human resources department, I was, I was, just, I was, what? 
[03:05:00]  Human resources?  It's radio.  We're a bunch of idiots.  Because there's no balance.  Like, it's intended, because, look, women in a long time, look, you find out your wife  for years, the boss was rubbing his dick on the back of her knuckles.  Like, guys were pieces of shit to women.  So there's, like, a balance between being that and the hypersensitivity.  It's like, we're not a balanced country.  We're just a bunch of reactionary assholes.  Like, I don't want people to be harassed at work.  Like, you should be able to go to work without having to deal with that shit.  But if a guy hangs up a sexy calendar or affords a joke, it's like, no one ever just 
[03:05:30]  tells sensitive people, shut the fuck up.  It's no tolerance, Jimmy.  It's all about no tolerance.  It's lawsuits.  It's all lawsuits.  Companies are sick of getting sued and losing.  So they tell you, take it down.  Don't do that.  And then the whole day, you're bored.  Bored shitless.  When I walk around these halls, I just nod at women.  I just nod.  I just nod.  I take my thumb.  I lick it.  And I shove it up their asses as hard as I can.  And then I go, hardy, har, har. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  I've never had one complaint yet.  I've got HR.  Someone who worked for Letterman 18 years ago.  What's up?  Yeah, well, I was talking to you guys just a second ago when Anthony told me to fuck off  and hung up on me.  Oops.  But I spent a year working on Letterman's show when he was dating Merrill Marco, who was a  producer.  And he was absolutely nothing but nice and sweet to her, the crew. 
[03:06:30]  You know, you hear stories, but it really doesn't matter.  The other thing is what Walter said is so correct.  I mean, you meet people in the workplace, and where else are you going to find people?  Where else are you going to date people?  We said that, too.  Especially someone like Letterman, who's so isolated.  He can't just wander around Manhattan.  Everyone recognizes him.  He's going to go to a bar and just hang out.  He totally travels in a bubble.  He doesn't have an entourage.  He likes to slip in and out unnoticed without anybody knowing who he is. 
[03:07:00]  And then I worked at CBS for 18 years, and I had an opportunity to work on the show over  there because I moved networks, you know, long before he did.  But the same thing held true.  You know, you meet people in the workplace, and who gives a damn?  First of all, it's between him and his wife.  He wasn't legally married.  There were no legal documents.  It's a moral issue.  And if you're going to comedians for moral issues, you've got to have your head examined.  That's like going, what, you might as well go to a terrorist for raspberry jam. 
[03:07:30]  That's right, Andy.  Or Jimmy.  Or Jimmy.  Guy throws in the wrong reference.  That's right, Danny.  But the one thing, everyone is acting shocked over this Letterman thing.  Yes, he rocked.  Oh, people are shocked about that?  What's that, Kenny?  I couldn't hear you.  But basically, when you get a job, that's the first place, if you're single, especially,  where you're looking for pussy.  That's where you're looking.  That's the first place you look. 
[03:08:00]  Because that's where you're spending most of your fucking time with other people.  Dude, day one, you look around and go, wow.  Way out of pussy.  You start looking around like, you know, she would be nice to do whatever, right?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Exactly.  And then it goes from that, where you try that circle, and then if you're doing happy  hour with people from the workplace, now you're looking at the friends of the people you work  with.  Yes.  It's worked like that since the beginning of fucking working.  Exactly.  You guys have no idea how much skirt is in the network, and the networks hire all of 
[03:08:30]  these fresh out of Brown, fresh out of Princeton, all of these hot, hot-looking women.  They don't know jack shit about the entertainment business or anything about news, but they are  there to be yes people, and they can be taught.  So that's why they hire these people.  And these people, you know, you can walk around NBC or ABC with a perpetual city.  I got to admit, I had an okay line, but now it's way too long. 
[03:09:00]  No, it's not.  And you heard a million times.  No, it's not.  When he was using the fresh out of line, I was going to go, can you say fresh out of  diapers to make Anthony happy as well?  Oh.  But now it doesn't work, because now we're three minutes past where I should have used  it, because this guy didn't want to shut up.  Oh, he's sweet.  He is a chatty little cat.  He doesn't know any better.  He's been around.  No, some nice insight from you, sir.  Thank you, boys.  Punching out.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:09:30]  John's saying the Michael Vick Nike deal is the same deal that every other player in  the NFL has.  Yeah, it's probably just, you know, they didn't want to be a big deal.  They want to, all right, whatever.  Trying to downplay it a little bit.  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I just talked.  My mouth just opened and words came out with no value, as usual.  John of Long Island.  Yeah, how you doing?  I just want to let you guys know you can still have fun at work.  Yeah?  This guy at work, construction worker, got caught banging an apprentice in the machine 
[03:10:00]  room, and he didn't get fired.  And he was banging her all over the building, and nothing happened.  Well, maybe she didn't care.  Yeah, maybe.  You know, it's a tough situation, I guess, because she's an apprentice.  She's beneath him.  He was the foreman, so.  Uh-huh.  I would love to.  Nothing happened to him, my friend.  Well, well, well, well.  We should talk to human resource people.  Try to understand their world.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Craig Ferguson on Letterman.  You like the Craig Ferguson?  I never watched him. 
[03:10:30]  I don't watch the Craig Ferguson.  Does I?  I don't know.  That accent bothers me.  Really?  On him.  Like other people, it's fine.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  See, talk about vaginas.  What's the one?  The almond.  No, the freckle.  What is that one?  Bigger in the freckle.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  I nigh.  Nigh, nigh. 
[03:11:00]  Well, I guess by now you've all figured out how I got the job.  Oh, man.  I mean, just for a second, put yourself in my position.  If you don't know, I'm sure you already know.  David Letterman, the king of late night television, unless you believe the NBC press release, the king of late night television, got himself into a little bit of a situation which he's, you know, dealing with. 
[03:11:30]  And he's my boss.  And my job is to, you know, take the number one news story of the day and, you know, have a bit of fun with it.  Now, imagine your boss.  See?  So, like, your boss is caught with his...  No, that's a bad example.  You're... 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, that's a tough spot for Greg Ferguson.  Yeah, that's a good way to handle it.  He's got to say something, but...  What's really strange is Conan O'Brien hasn't...  Unless he started making the jokes last night, but, you know, last week...  I didn't hear anything.  Last week he wasn't really doing anything on this.  I didn't hear nothing.  What's that about?  I didn't hear nothing.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I honestly don't know why.  He doesn't seem very confrontational.  I think he should have addressed it.  There's a way to address it without Trash and Letterman.  You know?  Well, yeah, I think you should have addressed it.  Wait, stop it. 
[03:12:30]  Your boss is caught in a situation which he or she...  Because ladies can be bosses too.  I look forward to your letters.  You're the person that you work for.  The person you admire and respect is caught in an embarrassing situation.  And your job is to be funny about that.  Whilst trying to keep your own job. 
[03:13:00]  So, this is my last show.  It's not bad, right?  Continue or you want to...  Yeah, sure.  That's not bad.  Keep going?  Yeah.  I will say this.  I know why he lost me.  I'm just kidding.  I will say this.  If we are...  It just occurs to me.  If we are now holding late-night talk show hosts to the same moral accountability as we hold politicians or clergymen, 
[03:13:30]  I'm out.  I'm gone.  Because...  Because I, you know, I don't think I've kept it a secret from you that I have a few incidents in my own past. 
[03:14:00]  But I made the smart move.  I wrote them down in a book.  There you go.  Yeah, good.  There's more, but we get the point.  Yeah.  Get the point.  Get the parent.  Get the parent.  Get the parent.  Yeah, it's a big story, but I don't know.  The way Dave's handling it, I don't really see it turning into anything bigger than this.  A few more details come out.  This guy, for his extortion, gets in trouble. 
[03:14:30]  Dave skates.  What are they going to do?  Fire him?  No.  No.  No.  No.  He's fine.  No.  Oh, he's fine.  Let me go to Tony in Los Angeles.  Tony.  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey, I work for a company that has two brothers.  And one of the brothers is doing the HR.  And then the other one is doing his secretary. 
[03:15:00]  And now the secretary is my boss.  That sounds very sordid.  Yeah.  Sounds like a web of intrigue.  Well, she's doing another employee now, too.  That works with me.  Oh.  Jesus.  Where do you work?  The bunny ranch?  Everybody's just putting their dicks in anything that moves or doesn't.  If I ain't nailed that, I'll fuck it.  That's what I say.  Just did.  You bet I did. 
[03:15:30]  I'm just stalling.  We got something.  What?  Virus?  Big virus?  No, I think the virus is a once a day kind of guy.  Yeah.  What do we got?  I'm going to go pee.  Fucking virus.  We got something.  What?  We just got something.  We got a little something something.  Clap.  Clamydia.  The herb.  What do we got?  Clamydia.  Oh, clap.  Clamydia.  We got something. 
[03:16:00]  One's relatively new, right?  Got it where?  It's been around a while.  We got something.  Let's do it.  Look out.  Here comes the something.  Oh, wait.  I see Samuel walking up.  He's holding something.  He's got something.  He's holding something that looks covered in a black little.  Dude, you're not going to believe this.  We know it's not my cock and a hooker.  You're right.  It's covered.  You're not going to believe this, but I bought Ted Williams' head.  Wow.  Here it is.  Ted Williams' head. 
[03:16:30]  Sam is bringing in Ted Williams' head.  If you put that on my.  Let me move my kiss pictures, Sam.  Whatever it is.  I don't want it there.  Put it right on top of there.  It's just show prep.  I never use it.  No.  It's obvious.  What is.  This is for you, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  We were supposed to do this yesterday.  You put a dirty shirt over the cake that we're going to eat?  What are you doing?  It's a clean shirt.  It's brand new.  Oh, my goodness.  Look, it's a little cake.  Yep.  It said, after all these years, free at last.  And it's a picture of a ball and chain. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Or not picture.  It's an actual ball and chain on the cake.  It's like one of these designer cakes.  That's right.  And then inside the clamp that would go around my ankle, because the ball and chain is almost  actual size, is a little version of me with my pants down.  I'm on my tummy, on my knees, with my pants down and my high knees up in the air.  And money is coming out of my ass.  That's great.  Yes. 
[03:17:30]  My anus.  Money.  And I see I have a little holster on it.  My gun is on the floor.  So that's an inaccuracy.  I would never unholster my gun like that.  Of course not.  Wouldn't come out.  And that's it.  And that's for my freedom from my checks that I had to send the ex.  Because it's over.  Yes, sir?  Yes, Mars?  The holster is not on the floor.  It's the gun.  Yeah, I know.  I said I'm wearing a holster, and the gun is on the floor. 
[03:18:00]  And that's inaccurate, because I would never lose the gun out of the holster.  No, of course not.  That's a no-no.  That's really good.  But that's good.  I like the...  Tell them where we got it.  You like?  Where'd you get it?  Tell them where we got it, Mars.  When the chain is broken.  Tell them where the cake came from.  Tell them.  Cake came from my wife.  Her website is cakesbykelly.com.  K-E-L-L-L-Y?  Cakes.  Oh, Cakes by Kelly.  Cakes is a K? 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  Both two Ks.  Oh, so Cakes is misspelled.  Yes.  Perfect.  All right.  That's perfect.  Why wouldn't you just have Cakes by Kelly regular?  Is that taken?  Yes, that was taken.  He didn't know that Cakes was misspelled until we just told him, by the way.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I thought it was Cakes with a K.  Let's have him say stuff.  Like?  What do you want him to say?  Do you finally know David's last name?  Duchovny.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, wow.  I got it now.  The motorcycle show.  Sons of Anarchy. 
[03:19:00]  So did...  An...  What flavor cake is that?  Uh, raspberry and, uh, vanilla.  You don't like raspberry?  I love raspberry.  Jimmy?  I'm gonna try it, right?  Jimmy made a face.  No, it sounds good.  Why were you making a face?  Oh, he's made another face.  That's the, uh, welcome home Uncle Joey cake.  Back to the future.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  For your birthday.  That's good.  Look at that.  Money coming out my ass.  I just tweeted the pic.  It felt like...  Because everyone's yelling at me.  Tweet the fucking cake.  That's what it felt like. 
[03:19:30]  It's on the way, boys and girls.  OP Radio on Twitter.  Here's your story of the day as we cut up that cake.  Thought we'd do a little something-something for you, Ant.  Here is your story of the day.  A tragic attack in, I think, Florida.  Yes, I heard about it.  These five raccoons may look innocent in home video, but neighbors around here fear them.  When does a raccoon look innocent?  You're always, like, on guard when you see a raccoon.  They are adorable.  Do you have raccoons at your house? 
[03:20:00]  Oh, I used to at the last house I was at.  Huh?  He's going to go make weebies.  I used to have a raccoon at the house that I lived at before this house.  And it used to invade the garbage pail in the back.  But I didn't have garbage pails.  I had, like, these underground little metal hatches.  And you open it up and throw your garbage down there.  Where was this?  And a great neck, I guess.  Oh, okay.  And then the garbage guys would come around the back of the house  and lift the pails out of the ground.  Sure.  So there were, like, garbage pails all over the neighborhood. 
[03:20:30]  But the little raccoon would try to lift it up,  and I'd hear, like, clang, clang, clang.  And then I went to the back door, and I'd look,  and there he was with his little hand  and his little crook little burglar mask  trying to open it up.  And it was adorable.  With his little human-like hand?  Yes.  It's creepy.  The thing is, when you're inside, it's fine behind a glass door.  Right.  But they are not to be petted or backed into a corner. 
[03:21:00]  Then they get a little rambunctious.  Well, there was a problem with the raccoons down in Florida.  Yeah.  These five raccoons may look innocent in home video,  but neighbors around here fear them  after the gang attack that Sheriff Grady Judd says  filleted 74-year-old Gretchen Whitted.  They viciously attacked her.  I mean, she has large, gaping wounds on her legs.  And Christy Turner can testify to the gruesomeness of the injuries.  There was blood everywhere, 
[03:21:30]  and she had a gash on the back of her head.  Her legs were just open, exposed.  But what scares Turner?  I have three little children,  and, you know, it's nothing to walk at night at 5 o'clock.  The raccoons are still on the run.  The sheriff's department put out 12 traps  in the yards of people living around here  and in storm drains  because this is where the raccoons ran after attacking Whitted.  Once the animals are caught using cat food to lure them into traps,  the sheriff says they'll be euthanized and then tested for rabies. 
[03:22:00]  Quite frankly, we're frightened that  if they're comfortable with this conduct,  what's to stop them from attacking again?  And another attack is Turner's worst nightmare,  who couldn't imagine seeing one of the neighborhood kids shredded like Whitted.  We used to be able to let the children just play in the backyard,  and I just don't feel safe doing that anymore.  It's scary.  One way or the other,  the sheriff says they're getting these raccoons.  One way or another.  They're gonna get them.  They're gonna get them, get them, get them, get them. 
[03:22:30]  I don't understand why we kill animals for doing what they're supposed to do,  kill things.  Well, they gotta test for rabies.  Oh, you can't test for rabies if they're alive or something, right?  No, you gotta take their brain out,  and that's the only way you can tell by testing their brain tissue.  They haven't figured out the rabies test to make it a little nicer on everyone?  It's almost like the old test they gave to see if you're a witch.  Right.  They would dunk you in water,  and if you drown, you were innocent.  So, it is kind of like that thing. 
[03:23:00]  They gotta cut out the brain,  see if he's got rabies.  There is a raccoon fucking a beagle.  Is that real?  I hope so.  It's gotta be.  Wow.  The best picture I think I've ever seen on the internet is...  Is a deer trying to hump a Weimerammer?  The Weimerammer's not happy about it.  No.  They're smart animals.  You knew it was coming.  Jimmy, five raccoons...  I didn't call that lady I was reading, but yeah.  Yeah, so now they gotta kill all the raccoons.  Go ahead, fuck them.  They're nasty animals.  They're adorable.  If they were cute, you would say don't kill them? 
[03:23:30]  No, they're aggressive, though.  They're shitty.  They kill pets.  Fuck raccoons.  They just waddle around.  They stink.  Give me a list of animals we should kill.  Rats?  Yeah, roaches.  Roaches?  Of course.  Oh, if we're going to some bugs.  Oh, my God.  That's not a happy thing.  It's a male.  What is that?  A male dog.  It's a Weimerammer being humped by a young deer.  Get the fuck out of here.  And it's gone.  That's a fake deer. 
[03:24:00]  All right, we should kill all rats, all raccoons.  Rats go.  How about...  Not raccoons.  I'm not...  Not all raccoons, no.  They're too cute.  Well, I'm saying all.  I mean, we're saying get rid of the fucking species.  Okay, then just rats.  Kinkachos.  And roaches.  I want to kill all the kinkachos.  What about possums?  Oh, possums.  Every possum should go?  Yeah, possums are ugly as shit and worthless.  Possums.  They're like giant rats.  They don't bother me, though.  No, no.  They're disgusting looking.  How about...  Kangaroos, definitely.  Kangaroos. 
[03:24:30]  Do you want a kangaroo?  Because they're hopping makes me dizzy.  Aren't they the rat of Australia?  Didn't someone once tell us?  No, that was like the opossum.  They're not as cute and possibly cuddly like everyone thinks.  They're like...  Wow, did you blast that out.  I almost fell down.  God.  What about skunks?  Speaking of smell.  They're cute, though, man.  Skunks are cute.  They stink if you fuck with them like Jimmy.  They have no ability to defend themselves other than their little heinies.  Well, that's a pretty good ability to defend yourself.  That's just like Jimmy. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  He has no ability to defend himself except for his heinie.  The skunks get scared, Jimmy.  They get very frightened.  They push the fear out.  Wow, that's a bad one.  Yes, they do.  You know what?  Where's Sam?  We got to play the beep game with the Coon story real fast.  Get a laugh out.  Thank you for that suggestion there.  Whoever you were, it's now long gone.  Jimmy did.  Sam better run his ass down that hall.  I want to try that ugly cake.  It's right there for the taking.  It looks like it's armor-plated, though. 
[03:25:30]  It's like a teeny, teeny piece.  Is that like...  She makes good cakes.  It's like a model.  More than a cake.  All right.  What the fuck?  It's like a papier-mâché cake.  See, it's...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think you're supposed to eat that.  That's the thing.  I think you can if you want, but it's so...  Yeah, it's just more decoration than anything.  Are you supposed to get that shit off of it?  There's a shirt on it.  Huh?  Come on.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  He gets so upset. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know what to do.  You're making us all nervous.  I don't know what I'm doing, Gregory.  Trying to cut a delicious piece of breakfast cake.  Any good?  No?  Yeah.  That is good, actually.  It's good cake?  Mm-hmm.  Of course it is.  Cake.  What's wrong with the cake, Jeremy?  No, it's actually good.  It has two Ks.  Yeah, cake.  K-A-K-E.  What job and how much? 
[03:26:30]  What do you think?  The eucalyptus leaf eating koala bear.  Should they go?  Yeah, they're not cute.  Those noses are really stupid looking.  They look like, what, like nails or something?  Like snap-on.  Big, huge fucking nose.  Yeah, big, beady red eyes.  Koala, by the way, is the most mispronounced word in the fucking English language.  Really?  How is it pronounced?  Koala!  Koala.  I did not know that. 
[03:27:00]  Thank you, Ted.  Oh, Ted.  No, Ted calls it, it's a beautiful koala.  Koala bear.  Koala bear.  Let's say hi to Tony in Cleveland.  Tony!  Hey, Ant.  Hey.  You think those fucking raccoons are so cute, man?  They got this parasite that lives in their intestines.  Yeah.  And kids pick it up on the playground.  And when it gets inside of an adult human, it starts eating their brain, their ocular  nerves, and everything.  Fun fact for the day. 
[03:27:30]  That sounds fishy to me.  Yeah.  Certainly does.  Hey, that's not urban legend, man.  That's a little suspect.  Bravo, Sierra?  It was on that Tiny Monsters or whatever on Discovery.  Ah, yeah.  See, they try to go.  There's a show called Tiny Monsters?  Yeah.  Yep.  Really?  Yep.  Some bullshit like that, yeah.  Oh, that sounds cool.  I'd watch a show called Tiny Monsters.  Yeah.  Little rats.  Oh, people want to know about under-protest, Ant.  Leave your logo. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, I have no idea.  I don't know what that meant or means.  Nothing.  It's done.  Why don't you try on your cake, Ant?  We brought it in for you.  Have a piece of fucking cake.  I'm not hungry.  I ate my big fucking, I ate my bagel and turkey sandwich like a good boy.  I don't eat cake.  You don't like cake?  You like cakey, not flaky.  Sometimes I like cakey.  Cakey, not flaky, right?  Yeah, I like cakey, not flaky, which would mean then I would like something like a muffin  instead of like an apple turnover. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  Is Sam doing the beep game?  Because that's what we're stalling for.  And then we're going to get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, then we can do that.  Good, right?  It's not bad.  The cake's all right there?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  I think we did everything we could possibly do today.  Did we?  Letterman.  We were good.  Obama pitches healthcare reform with a bunch of doctors at White House.  Hey, Danny, what's this BET founder thing mocking the Virginia governor candidate?  She was basically, she was making a speech somewhere.  And she's endorsing her candidate. 
[03:29:00]  And apparently, I guess the guy that's running against this guy in Virginia has a stutter.  Oh, really?  And then so she's addressing a crowd.  And then this is what she had to say.  Oh, shit.  The next is communication.  We need someone who can really communicate.  And Bob McDonald can communicate.  The other people that I talked to, and especially his opponent, he could not articulate what needed to be done. 
[03:29:30]  All right, so communication is hugely important.  Oh, wow, is she fucked.  That bombed.  Wow.  You heard somebody go, oh, oh.  You know something?  Yeah.  He should just turn around and fucking just start ragging on her awful tits or something. 
[03:30:00]  Wow.  Just now it's fair game.  Now you can say anything.  She's right to make fun of that, though.  If you're a politician who stutters, you should be made fun of and mocked.  You're a fucking asshole.  What does she look like?  Like, let me get a look.  Oh, she's the BET founder?  Yeah, she is.  Well, then there's plenty of other things he can mock then, I guess.  And where is, wow, that is the whitest, lightest black woman I've ever seen in my life.  I might trip up and actually make an inappropriate joke in front of her. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, that is Sheila Johnson.  That's always my fear.  She needs to be roasted.  Is that I'm going to say something, you know, and then turn around and go, what?  I thought you were, you know, on our side.  You were on our team.  The side of white, which is right.  She is not black.  She looks black.  Nah, you know what?  She's not black enough.  She must be shunned in the community.  You have to be black enough?  Yeah, she's not quite black enough.  Where's the stuttering politician?  What does he look like?  I'll have to pull up. 
[03:31:00]  I'll have to find his name.  You're a black guy?  I would bet a lot of money.  So and so for Congress.  I spent a lot of money.  He was a black guy.  Andy, Michigan.  What's up, Andy?  Hey, guys.  Back on the animal thing.  I think you should get rid of the horn screamer.  Lingo, lingo, lingo.  Remember that fucking horn screamer?  Do you remember that horn screamer?  Yes.  I might have audio of the horn screamer.  Let me take a look here.  Sheila Johnson.  What's his name?  Craig Deeds.  That's a nice name.  If he's a black guy, she should be ashamed of it. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, that's him?  Let me see Craig.  He's just your standard, all-American-looking white guy.  Do we have our fucking audio of Craig Deeds?  I want to hear the Deeds talk.  Dirty Deeds.  Oh.  Let's try to song.  Hmm.  I want to hear him address her and try to say a word that starts with  N-I.  Well, any word, you know. 
[03:32:00]  Like what?  Nitpick.  There's some YouTube stuff.  We could just see if he – we could play it until he starts stuttering, I guess.  All right.  If he does.  Probably just even –  Now, one place we can't afford to run television ads in is Northern Virginia.  This gives us an incredible boost in name recognition.  It gives us a boost in credibility, and it's huge.  Now, this is obviously a great day for your campaign, but you still –  Two or three polls have come out in this past week that still show you trailing Mr. McAuliffe 
[03:32:30]  by double-digit margins.  And the time is small, and the amount of resources that he has is vastly superior to the amount  of resources that you have.  Can you still close that gap in the short amount of time that you have?  We can close that gap.  We're planning on closing that gap.  We're planning on winning the nomination on June 9th.  We're planning on being elected governor on November 3.  You know, the other – there's another candidate out there that has the ability to buy this  election.  It's not that bad.  It's big A for Congress.  If his nomination is for sale, he will make the purchase. 
[03:33:00]  There's no doubt about that.  But if Virginians want to move forward in the tradition of Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, two  great governors, if Virginians want to create opportunity and prosperity –  He's all right.  What's wrong with that woman?  He switches gears quick.  He's all right.  Yeah.  Imagine if he really tripped her in the State of the Union.  Like Fonzie trying to say wrong.  I think if he pauses, then he's going to have a lot of problems.  Yeah.  What a bitch to bring that up. 
[03:33:30]  They should absolutely be coming.  The hornswoggler. 
[03:34:00]  And that's a happy one.  It's horrible.  That's a happy one.  Just imagine.  That is horrible.  Get it agitated.  That's when it's happy.  Just enjoying the day.  And people have them just all day they do that shit?  All day long.  All day long.  That's the worst sound ever.  That's what the virus hears when he's trying to come up with a punchline. 
[03:34:30]  Craig Deeds.  You know, you're just a negative person.  Jesus.  Like um.  Like um.  Like um.  Like um.  We're just waiting for Sam to do the beep game with the Coons story, and then we're going  to get out of here.  What are you promoting there, Jimmy?  Denver, right?  Well, this is Friday, Saturday, Denver at the Improv.  Oh.  Following weekend, Virginia Beach, Funny Bone, October 15th through 17th. 
[03:35:00]  What about Thursday at Leno?  Yeah, this Thursday, definitely do a Leno.  Yeah.  We're going to do Line of the Day while we wait.  And my Buffalo first show sold out.  Nice.  So there's been another show added.  How many seats?  50?  Um.  Hey.  37, but that's with comps.  It comes to 50.  Nice.  And Boston, I got two nights in November.  You better get tickets now.  Yes, they will sell out.  Where are you playing in Buffalo?  Uh.  Town Ballroom.  Town Ballroom.  Do I know that place?  First show's done.  10.30 show's on sale. 
[03:35:30]  I don't want to share his name.  I don't know.  Town Ballroom.com.  What street?  Um.  Main Street.  681 Main Street.  Ooh, Main Street?  I wonder if they fixed up Main Street.  Last time I was there, Main Street was scary.  Highten?  Oof.  Line of the Day time.  Why not?  Why don't we do that?  Line of the Day.  How many we got there?  Four runner-ups.  Sam works on the audio.  Hopefully, I'll have it in a couple minutes here.  What's up, Sam?  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Then I hear behind me, as I'm having small talk with a doctor,  enjoy your sleep. 
[03:36:00]  And just before they said enjoy your sleep,  I thought I felt some kind of warm sensation.  And then they said...  They're pissing on you.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a bunch of Indian guys yelling white devil.  Tangling on you.  That was a good one.  That happened today.  Yes.  That was earlier in the day.  A little propofol humor.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  And then there was one picture with a lot of green stuff.  And that was my stomach.  That's totally normal.  That's just your bile.  Ah, that's all the gook in there that makes things dissolve. 
[03:36:30]  It's weird.  It's the stuff your friends have to deal with.  Fuckers.  Look at Sam running.  Oh, look at him run.  Look at this.  Look, look.  What a tool.  That's really how he runs?  I know.  How's it going to be a big trip and just fell through the window?  Sam, is that really how you run?  I'm like broken glass.  We don't laugh as his head tumbled in here.  Kick it around like fucking Ted Williams.  He runs like a cartoon character. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Not competitively.  You do.  Is that really how you run?  Not competitively.  Why you run differently?  Don't run competitively.  If I were to run competitively, I'd be much better.  Oh.  Sam, what's this?  It's a beef game with the raccoon that you wanted.  The raccoon audio.  Oh, we asked for this?  Yeah, a few times.  Oh, okay.  Let's take a listen.  See if it's different if you put some beeps in it.  These five may look innocent in home video, but neighbors around here fear them after  the gang attack that Sheriff Grady Judd says filleted 74-year-old Gretchen Whitted. 
[03:37:30]  They viciously attacked her.  I mean, she has large gaping wounds on her.  And Christy Turner can testify to the gruesomeness of the injuries.  There was blood everywhere.  Her just open, exposed.  But what scares Turner?  I have three little children, and, you know, it's nothing to walk at night at five o'clock.  What is it?  What are you upset about? 
[03:38:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  That's where the beeps were.  It took you so long.  For that?  Exactly.  That's what you asked for.  And what about viciously beep?  That's where the beeps fit in.  Trust me.  I know my craft.  Because then it would have been fucked.  Yep.  Yeah.  Assaulted.  I'd have probably clipped raccoon down.  I mean...  And then just bleeped that, but left... 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, but I...  You know what I mean?  Like...  Boons!  I was thinking about taking out a syllable here and there, but...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That might have been a little, uh...  Pushing it a little far.  And I didn't want my name attached.  So we do here.  What's the matter?  You want to be able to go next door and...  No, I would like to be able to continue working here.  Maybe you're not going to be able to do the shows over here if you pay a little too much attention  to not upsetting the people across the hall.  Because if someone were to get upset about that, I would assume that you guys would say, 
[03:39:00]  yeah, we didn't know.  Sam just handed this to you.  We would assume right.  I would run, like, fucking...  Run for the hills.  You know what they say when you assume, Anthony?  Oh, what is that, Ted?  Many mistakes are made.  For you and me.  Like errors.  Thank you, Ted.  You're welcome.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Thank you, Sam.  He's spilling it.  That you got made it for now.  Stop your spilling it. 
[03:39:30]  Would she go out the same way?  It makes me go boo.  When I sit beside the store, I got the boo that I.  Y'all can't keep a plate, eh.  No one knew what I was talking about.  You're spilling it.  Line of the day time.  Fucking DDT all over his grandfather's dead body.  You know that was some industrial strength fucking bug killer back then.  In the 40s?  Oh, please. 
[03:40:00]  Here's the last runner-up line of the day.  Let me tell you what I used to do in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  And this guy says he'd rather play his own...  Can you eat it?  I knew that you could.  Wait, can you play that one again?  Here's what made me laugh so hard about that one.  It was also when Ant goes, could you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Then he just went, ugh.  Like, it was just...  It was so to himself. 
[03:40:30]  Please.  Let me tell you what I used to do in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  And this guy says he'd rather play his own...  Oh, I hate that Billy Crystal bit.  Oh, do I hate it.  You don't like that?  Oh, it's the worst thing...  The worst thing I think I've ever seen a comic do.  Aside from the normal, you know, total hack comics. 
[03:41:00]  But, you know, he's supposed to be good.  Line of the day time.  Hit it.  I thought that was it.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Well, if you heard about John and Kate...  No, what's going on with John and Kate, Virus? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, come on, Vi.  Well, John withdrew $2,300,000.  Viruses is going to have to go and spread more hilarity tomorrow.  All right, Virus gets the line of the day.  That's got to make him happy.  It's for being a retard.  $2,300,000.  What a fucking...  What a fucking...  What a blithering idiot.  Can't wait for his appearance tomorrow.  Or maybe we rest him. 
[03:42:00]  I don't know.  No, we don't rest him.  No, we probably won't rest him.  Oh, you want to rest him?  We really should.  Because, I mean, unlike everything else, maybe we shouldn't...  Oh, you don't want to run him into the ground?  Yeah, we shouldn't run this one in the ground.  Like walking normally does?  It has potential.  Run him into the ground.  All right, guys.  Later.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
