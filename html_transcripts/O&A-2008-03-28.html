<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The March 28th, 2008, Opie and Anthony Show was a whirlwind of vulgar humor, celebrity interviews (some more successful than others), and meandering discussions.  The show opened with Rich Voss in studio, already setting the tone with a humorous, albeit rambling, account of a disastrous trip involving dental work, a broken hand, and an unexpected encounter with a young girl in Alabama.  This was followed by a detailed, and often graphic, recounting of his experiences: a Comedy Central pilot taping gone wrong (a boxing segment with Keith Robinson ending in a fight), struggles with drug addiction, a bizarre hotel room experience with Opie in Florida involving an older woman, and a highly descriptive account of a recent prostate exam.  Listener calls on drug addiction and recovery interspersed with these anecdotes.  Voss also promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.

Nick DiPaolo joined the studio, bringing with him a discussion about his transition from NYC radio to BlogTV, its international audience, and dealing with online trolls.  He also discussed using the platform to find attractive women, a topic met with mixed reactions from his wife.  A major segment focused on Larry Sinclair, a man claiming a drug-fueled encounter with Barack Obama, with the hosts playing a YouTube clip of Sinclair’s account and discussing its credibility (or lack thereof). This segued into a discussion of the 2008 presidential election, peppered with racially charged jokes and remarks about the candidates.  Other tangents included a lengthy, humorous debate on the Woodstock lineup, the rise of Ultimate Fighting, and fabricated news stories about Hillary Clinton’s memory and a Bigfoot molestation claim.

Comedian Mike Birbiglia then joined the studio, alongside DiPaolo.  Birbiglia promoted his upcoming shows at Caroline's, and the conversation shifted to a "worst comedian bracket" run by another radio show, featuring comedians like Jay Leno, Gallagher, and Yakov Smirnoff.  A news story about a woman forced to remove her nipple ring at an airport sparked more vulgar commentary. Birbiglia shared personal anecdotes about his weight, a CBS pilot, sleepwalking, and the Bigfoot story was revisited.

The show continued with a segment focused on one host’s bad roast experience, followed by extensive, vulgar riffing on various topics including a trucker strike, women's fashion, parenting, and extended mockery of Richard Jeni’s comedy.  A phone call from a trucker and Rich Voss, the latter focusing on his comedic career and perceived mistreatment by Opie and Anthony, punctuated this segment. The hosts also discussed a planned ambush makeover and upcoming appearances by other comedians.  The consistently offensive and sexually explicit commentary continued throughout this portion.

The broadcast culminated in a chaotic and highly offensive phone interview with Leslie Nielsen, promoting "Superhero Movie."  The hosts and Rich Voss relentlessly harassed and insulted Nielsen, focusing on his age, health, and perceived hearing impairment.  Bill Burr briefly joined the call, only to receive similar treatment.  The show then featured a brief exchange with Bill Burr and Jim Norton, who were in the same city but at competing stations.  The segment ended with further insults and vulgar jokes, ending abruptly.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts engaged in frequent insults, personal anecdotes, and off-color jokes, with the level of vulgarity remaining consistently high.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Do you get it?  They talk about us a lot.  I want to pet a deer.  Go petting zoo, you dummy.  I want to pet a deer.  Breast knuckles.  Clock them in breast knuckles.  Opie and Anthony.  This weekend, I went to a lesbian bar.  Are they making out and stuff?  Yeah, there was some making out. 
[00:01:00]  What does it smell like in one of them burps?  An old tackle box.  Where entertainment is going?  Larry King gets confused when friend Drescher starts speaking spack.  The power of Christ compels you.  She's speaking in tongues, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  For this Friday.  March 28th, 2008.  Yes, it is.  Good morning.  When the date is given out.  Good morning.  Yes, it is indeed Friday.  Ah.  That's right.  He writes right off the bat.  Good morning, FOs.  And then writes, make me laugh.  Go ahead.  Make me laugh.  What is that our job every day?  To make you laugh? 
[00:02:00]  Like clowns.  We're clowns?  I like to think this show is a little bit of everything.  If it was ye olde days, we would be the stupid court jesters.  Sure.  With the little bells on our hats and our curly pointy shoes.  People point and laugh at us.  We'd be the village idiots up on the walls.  Falling off so people can laugh at us.  But don't we do a lot of things?  We make people laugh.  We make people think, hopefully. 
[00:02:30]  We make people pissed, hopefully.  Because we don't want you to agree with this stuff.  No.  We make you excited.  Whoa, do we?  I like to sex up the show every once in a while.  All sexy.  It's all frothed.  Like the hot story of Sam mouth kissing the homeless gentleman.  Yeah.  Is that sexy?  Oh, yeah.  Make you want to kind of puke and stuff.  Yeah, definitely make you sick.  So it's not just make you laugh. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no.  Fast Freddy.  There's a lot of things going on here with this radio show.  Make you want to get arrested, too, I'm thinking.  Really?  Sometimes.  Something people want to get arrested.  I think that's just kind of a byproduct of this mess.  Have we kept track over the years of how many people have been arrested for this radio show?  Yeah, I think we did that at some point.  We're easily over double digits.  I think we're close to a couple dozen at this point.  Yeah.  Well, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:03:30]  Hoping for lots of phone calls today.  Lots of interactivity.  Participation.  Yeah, because then we don't have to work as hard.  Want to say good morning to the crackhead who's filling in for Jim Norton.  Yeah, known as the crackhead now.  Now I'm the crackhead?  Yeah, yeah.  A gentleman was in here yesterday.  Put your headphones on so you can hear there, Rich, because you're low in the mix.  Low in the mix.  What was that, Rampage?  Rampage Jackson was in here, and he goes,  The last time I was on your show, you had that crackhead in here. 
[00:04:00]  And we're just trying to think, like, what homeless guy did we have in?  Or did he think Tippi Tom was a crackhead?  Or are we doing something with people from the street?  And then, no, it turned out to be Rich Voss,  because that was the day you told the story about dressing sexy.  And your tiny Daisy Dukes to get more, you know, drugs from the drug dealer.  Drugs from your gay drug dealer.  Which, by the way, could be one of the top ten stories ever told on the radio show.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was a good one. 
[00:04:30]  That was a good one.  And I think Anthony said if he's admitting to wearing tiny little Daisy Dukes,  just imagine what he's not admitting to.  It's that whole iceberg thing, you know.  You just see the tip of it, but underneath just lies.  No one is 100% honest, so you're holding something back.  You're holding something back in that story.  Yeah.  Or maybe another story that's a little uglier.  A little racier.  A little uglier than the one you told.  You know, when you do stuff like that, drugs or whatever, that's, you don't have to blame yourself for the things you've done. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, because you were.  Yeah, because if you let it go and just forgive yourself first, then everybody else forgives you.  Your family, the people in the clinic.  That's why you guys clean up.  That's why you do it.  Because if you were still doing drugs, even if you got to the point where you could moderately do drugs or alcohol and actually be functional, live your life, 
[00:05:30]  you wouldn't be able to justify doing the awful things you did for drugs years ago.  So you have to cut yourself off completely and go, hey, that was another person.  It wasn't me.  You can't modify yourself.  You can't go from addict to modify.  You know, can you say rapist?  Let's say a rapist.  You can't go from a rapist to a peaker.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you can't downgrade anything like that, no?  You don't go, yeah, you don't really go from chocolate cake to, you know, to a cookie. 
[00:06:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Do you think it's possible for somebody that's a drug addict or an alcoholic to actually just cut down?  It's impossible.  If someone hits bottom and they're just like a drunk and knows that alcohol has just screwed their life up,  can't you just maybe have a couple of beers?  Most of the programs would say no, right, Rich?  Oh, all of them. 
[00:06:30]  I think there's some like new age programs out there.  They're like, eh, have a beer.  All right, have a beer, have a glass of wine.  Yeah, those are in bars.  They have the meetings in bars.  You can't, I mean, because like I used to, when I was doing crackers, I mean, I was, there was no condo.  I would even take free base and I would hide it around the house, right?  Sometimes I, I'll tell you one.  Oh.  Oh, here's a couple, here's one.  And I, I, I, I went and, I mean, I got tons of these, but I went and copped this girl of mine. 
[00:07:00]  No, yeah, it was Laura.  She goes, get me an eighth.  Get me an eighth.  Mm-hmm.  You know, here's 50 bucks and I'll be at, with Dave sleeping, just slip it under the door.  Right?  In the apartment.  Oh, no.  So I went and got her an eighth.  I got a bunch of these.  I got a couple of good ones.  I got her an eighth, right?  Yeah.  And I sat down under the door and I didn't, I went home, did mine, smoked it.  I go, ah, this is, I can't, I need more.  So I snuck back up to their apartment and I took a hanger and I pulled it back under the door. 
[00:07:30]  You pulled their, I pulled their coke back.  All right.  By the time they got up, six trips later, back and forth from my house.  Oh, my God.  You had it bad.  You had the bug.  One time, this guy said, listen, I was on the road.  I just started comedy.  I was doing it for like two years and I did a week on the road.  And he said, I'll get you high, man.  Let's get together.  You know, so he went and bought an eighth. 
[00:08:00]  That's three and a half grams.  He goes, we'll do a half a gram or a gram and I'll sell the rest.  Get my money back.  Of course.  Well.  Some of the best businessmen.  Cut, cut, he cut it up in six half grams and went to bed.  And I found out where he hid it.  So I kept going back to the store to get ammonia.  I would go buy ammonias, come back, cook a half a gram, pour the ammonia out and smoke  it and go, okay.  So I'll pay him for a half.  Well, I made five trips to the store by the moon. 
[00:08:30]  I go to the guy, you know, I'm coming in.  My mouth is all like that.  And I go, hey, you know, I got a cleaning business, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're buying that.  They're buying that, right?  So I smoked all this Coke.  Of course.  Of course.  And I'm sitting at like sunup drinking straight vodka and I hear him wake up screaming, right?  He comes down and he goes, what happened?  I go, ah, some guys came by and I sold it for you on credit.  Yeah.  On credit. 
[00:09:00]  On credit.  Yeah.  I checked out their credit rating was very high.  I believe they had a 750.  I would go on the road and tell people like, you know, we were done Saturday night.  I go, yeah, just front me a gram.  Sunday night, you come after the show Sunday night and I'll pay you, right?  Oh, you're gone.  You're out of town.  And then what?  You can never go back there again?  No, it's no big deal.  They're crappy one-nighters or whatever. 
[00:09:30]  I got to ask you.  There's probably still cities he can't go to.  I was going to ask you exactly that.  You've been clean for how many years, Rich?  18?  22.  Oh, you're up to 22.  Wow, time's flying by.  I remember when you bragged about 18.  Are there still people looking for you?  Are there still people going, come on, you still owe me.  Well, there's one guy I know.  You know this girl?  She was in a contest for you guys and had like a nice butt.  I really am supposed to fire you.  One of those butt contests you did, I think.  Sure, we used to do a nice-as-ass contest.  Sure.  I think I owe her brother 600 and something still. 
[00:10:00]  I'd pay him, I guess, if I ran into him, maybe.  Well, we could have him line up outside the door today for you.  That could be a bit we do.  That could be.  Hey, here's a guy that's actually trying to moderately use.  Ah.  Mark in Boston listening on BCN.  What's up, Mark?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I just heard you talking on moderately using drugs, and I don't know, I think I'm  kind of halfway there.  Yeah, you think you could do it?  Yeah, well, I'm high right now.  Seems to be working. 
[00:10:30]  Well, see, we're not saying you're not going to get high.  We're going to say, are you going to be functional?  Oh, yeah, I'm at work.  I'm functional.  Were you at the point, though, where you were doing too many drugs, and you knew it, and  it was screwing up your life, and you cut back?  Yeah, definitely.  I'm, like, living in a program right now.  Have you ever put brackets from a crane to a building?  Brackets from a crane to a building?  No.  Yeah, what's your job?  I'm a security guard.  And, uh...  He's taking things. 
[00:11:00]  He's taking things.  Yeah, what are you on?  He's on heroin.  Suboxins.  Suboxins.  Oh, yeah.  One of those downers, right?  No, those are, like, opiate blockers, but they still get you high.  They still get you high.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Seems to be working for him.  Yeah.  If he's up.  Well, okay, let's see how much it's working for him.  His career has taken him to a security guard.  Yeah.  On the graveyard shift.  Okay? 
[00:11:30]  And he's doing opiate blockers.  Let's say hi to Mike in Brooklyn.  Mike, what's going on, buddy?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, that Suboxone stuff that he's talking about is really wicked, man.  Really, really wicked stuff.  But I went through a type of program called Therapeutic Community.  It's a longer-term program.  And back in the day, they used to actually, like, give you drinking privileges after you  were clean for a certain amount of time.  Nowadays, they don't do it now.  But nowadays, they're realists.  And they know that, you know, there's a good chance that you might have a drink again. 
[00:12:00]  And you might want to, you know, kick back a beer or something.  So they kind of talk to you about drinking responsibly.  TPs.  Hey, didn't they, when you went to a TP, didn't they break you down, like, try to break you  down like the Marines and have, like, some guys, like, clean the floor with a toothbrush  and stuff like that?  No, no.  It ain't like that anymore.  You get the peel of the glass.  You get stories like that.  They don't need to break it down when you come in.  Don't make you want to do dope.  But aren't you like, you know, that they say people are messy?  Yeah.  That's a terrible thing.  It's been like almost 10 years. 
[00:12:30]  And I kick back a few beers.  You still kick back beers?  Absolutely.  Well, then you're not clean.  You're just off of heroin.  He's clean.  If you're doing heroin and you go to a couple of beers, that's an accomplishment.  No, it is.  I'm not saying it isn't.  But you can't say a couple of beers because people transfer addictions, okay?  You switch your addiction.  That's all.  Yeah.  I'm not saying he did.  I'm not saying he, you know.  I imagine those couple of beers takes away the itch a little bit.  Yeah.  I mean, like going from heroin and being completely clean, I can't even imagine that. 
[00:13:00]  You're right.  But for him, that works.  But for certain people, I'm not saying.  It doesn't work.  Right.  No, because the beer isn't enough.  That's not the high you're looking for.  You think the beer leads you right back to the heroin, right?  Well, you get a buzz.  You're going, you know what?  This isn't the buzz I want.  And, you know.  Yeah, but don't you.  The TC is more like a behavior modification as opposed to a disease model.  So, you know, you get used to living a lifestyle that's a positive lifestyle. 
[00:13:30]  And if you're, you know, if you're living a good life, you're not going to want to go  and stick a needle in your arm or smoke crack, you know, if you're living a good life.  You know, if you're being responsible and doing the things that you need to do.  So, if I have a couple beers and I'm watching the game, you know, it's just, you know,  it's just kind of hanging out.  It's not like I need to, you know, get myself to a different place.  I'm drinking for a different reason.  If you're having a couple beers and watching the game through somebody's window, you know,  the thing, too, the thing also, you know, he's saying, well, heroin and cocaine are 
[00:14:00]  the worst addictions.  That's not true.  You know, if I don't do heroin, I have a couple beers.  For him, cool, that works.  Right.  You see what I'm saying?  But a couple beers, there's people that don't do heroin and don't do cocaine, but all they  do is drink and their lives are a mess.  So, I mean, you know, I'm not judging the guy.  He's not doing heroin anymore.  You know?  Well, I mean, the show started.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Well, you can't drink a little bit, you know.  All right, sir.  Thanks.  Yeah, the show started just because Rampage Jackson said last time I was in here, I was 
[00:14:30]  in here with that crackhead.  The crackhead, Rich Voss.  So, we finally had to explain it to Rich Voss, a friend of ours.  And anyway, there's a couple other things to talk to Rich about.  We filmed a pilot for Comedy Central and you and Keith Robinson, another comedian who we  love, but for some reason is scared to do the radio show or something.  I don't know.  We tried to get him on.  He's been on once or twice.  He did well for us, but he can't get up in the morning or something.  He lives in Philly.  Well, he lives in... 
[00:15:00]  First of all, he's not going to get up this early, okay, because you know...  Well, he's got other things going on in his career?  No, but that's why he's...  Certain people don't like getting up early.  Get yourself out of bed.  All right.  Okay, Ben.  Can I tell you about...  Okay, we'll go into your story about the pilot, but when we did this pilot, did you explain  the pilot where you run around and...  No, no, no, no, no, no, we did not.  Oh, I asked you in there if you talked about it.  We talked about the pilot, but we didn't go into detail about...  We want some mystery still. 
[00:15:30]  About what the, you know, the whole object of it is or anything.  We just talked about the fact that you got your ass handed to you.  But I didn't get my...  All right.  Basically, we can say this.  We had some kind of a boxing thing that was supposed to be comedic.  Yeah.  And it turned out to be very real between you and Keith Robinson.  But a lot of people have seen in many different ways, by the way, what happened.  Yeah.  I say that, like, you kicked Keith, and that's what pissed him off, and then he was beating  the crap out of you on the ropes. 
[00:16:00]  Okay.  We basically were saying, what, not rope-a-dope, he was...  Dope-a-dope.  Dope-a-dope.  He was dope-a-doping you.  Okay, let's...  He was dope-a-doping you on the ropes.  And then you got so mad that you ran, because then there was a break, and then you ran and  gave him an old-school karate kick, which, by the way, was quite impressive, Rich.  Thank you.  And knocked him down, and then he really got pissed and jumped on top of you.  Okay, now, that's your story, which is a good radio show.  By the way, this was supposed to be, you know, funny. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  This thing we filmed was supposed to be funny, this particular thing with you and Keith Robinson.  It just turned into a hate crime.  Right.  It's really horrid.  Let me tell my story.  First of all, it's Rich Foss here at the Embellishers radio show.  This thing's taking on a life of its own.  I heard you guys are talking about it down at the Comedy Cellar.  Well, they might be talking about it, because, listen, first of all, you know, people like  to talk about Rich Foss, because it brings up the conversation.  Third person.  Okay.  They go in the ring. 
[00:17:00]  We go in the ring, and they go, all right, yesterday I was in the doctor, and I looked  at my CAT scan, and the bubble on my kidney is about this big, the cyst.  It's like a, what, an orange?  It's like a grapefruit or an orange.  Like, and, okay, so Keith, we're supposed to go in the ring, and they go, okay, we'll  put bubble wrap around you guys in headgear, this and that, right, and blindfold each other,  right?  We're blindfolded.  Supposedly.  So I go to-  Thanks, Rich.  What?  Remember how we said, remember when we were just talking- 
[00:17:30]  Do you remember a few minutes ago when we said to keep it vague?  Well, that's pretty vague.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Every detail of it is out.  Basically, we brought back blind boxing for a potential TV show.  Very good, Rich.  You think these people you're talking to out there are dumb?  Do you really think-  These people are smart.  They listen to every single word.  Every nuance.  Let me explain.  They listen for secret messages.  Okay.  These people aren't smart.  Okay, they're smart.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  But it's a key to the story.  Is it?  Yeah.  The story that, of course, makes me look bad.  Right.  We're supposed to go in a ring, and so I go to Keith.  I go, I can't do this.  I got this big thing on my kidney.  He goes, we're not going to punch each other.  Right?  He said we're going to be light.  You think it's a photo shoot, basically.  Right.  Okay, basically.  So we go in a ring.  They get us ready.  Ding, ding, go.  I threw a kick that I knew wasn't landing.  See, Opie, you think it landed, but I know it didn't, because I pulled back. 
[00:18:30]  I got to see the tape again, but go ahead.  I pulled back.  I can't.  Okay, let's say it didn't land.  Okay, let's say it didn't, right?  Because you haven't seen the tape.  How I saw it, basically, is they came out of the rings, and Rich, because, you know, he  is blind, because Rich gave that away.  Rich kind of, like, threw a kick out there, kind of feeling his way around.  I thought it landed.  Okay.  I know it didn't.  Okay.  Okay.  That's fine.  So then Keith came flying at me.  Why would he come flying at you then?  Because he could see me.  He was, he had his blindfold, okay, which we already know, up, or else he wouldn't have 
[00:19:00]  known I threw a kick, because it didn't land, so he could seem.  We had a whole, we had a production staff, we had Ant and I, we had the rest of the comedians.  Yeah.  To all of us, it looked like his blindfold was down.  It looked like it was down?  Yeah.  You know what?  You're saying his blindfold was up when yours was obviously down.  How would he know?  So how would you know?  Okay.  First of all, how would he know exactly where I was, that right after I threw this side  kick that didn't hit, to come running and punch me in the head? 
[00:19:30]  How would he know exactly, unless he could see me?  Yeah.  At that point, he ripped the blindfold off, I believe.  Yeah, he took it off.  Oh, he took it off?  Oh, hell yeah.  Because you pissed him off.  Okay, so I think-  My version of the story, you pissed him off, he takes the blindfold off, and attacks you.  So here's the deal.  And then you got mad.  Okay, now wait, that's even worse.  After he did the dope-a-dope on you.  That's even worse.  To your head and your kidneys, you got pissed, turned around, and gave a, what's that old 
[00:20:00]  cartoon, the karate cartoon?  A Hong Kong phooey.  Yeah, Hong Kong phooey.  Okay, so here's the thing.  You're saying, I didn't even know this.  This makes the story even better.  Okay, folks, I'm standing with a blindfold on, trying to, with a cyst on my kidney, ready  to get exploded, and a guy-  Don't forget, 55 years old, too, or whatever you are.  51, gonna be 50, and a guy without his blindfold is punching me in the head.  Wow, I can't believe I didn't win.  Wow, you know what? 
[00:20:30]  Because the odds were in my favor, okay?  Is it true that Keith called you and said his side is still hurting?  Yeah, I stuck him.  Let me tell you something.  You did stick him with that kick.  It was nice.  Then, after this, I go, what the hell are you doing?  Why wouldn't you punch like, he goes, well, I was showboating.  Okay, well, on my head, without your blindfold?  Yeah, and then you ripped your blindfold off and kicked him.  Yeah, well, after, after, sorry, I got pounded in the head by the guy that said we weren't  going to hit each other.  I'll agree with you.  I liked that kick.  Huh?  I liked that kick.  I think two kicks after that. 
[00:21:00]  The head shots that he was throwing were pretty impressive.  He hit you with a combination that really rocked your head back a couple of times.  See, here's the thing.  After it, I didn't feel any of it.  Yeah.  He called me in pain.  So, the bottom line, you know what?  Mm-hmm.  I had a fight.  When I was in school with this dude, I punched this guy.  We had a fight.  I punched him in the face.  Bam.  And then he grabbed me, right?  And we both fell on the ground, but all his weight fell on my arm, and I dislocated my arm  just from us falling. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  I wish I could only bend this far now, but I basically won the fight, but I'm the one  with the cast.  You see what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Keith might have had some nice punches on my head without his blindfold as I was wearing  mine.  You know what?  And right before that, about two months before that, Keith was in a hallway beating up an  old lady.  All right?  It's not like he's...  She was falling down with her walker.  With her walker.  See how excited he gets?  What? 
[00:22:00]  That was the highlight of the taping, by the way.  It really was.  Can I tell you one thing about...  Well, I'll ask you during a break.  What?  Well, because I don't want to give the show away.  What, another thing we taped?  Yeah, that tape.  They're very excited about this thing.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens, but they got a lot of great footage on Tuesday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, which one.  What?  Write it down as I give your plug out.  Here.  Write it down.  All right.  Rich Voss, by the way, is in studio, and he's going to be at Poughkeepsie.  Bananas Poughkeepsie, right?  Tonight?  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Tonight and tomorrow night at Bananas Poughkeepsie.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster, 845-462-3333.  He's writing something.  I'm getting...  All right.  Hold on.  Because this is good.  Famous Bananas.  This goes into my story.  Oh, is that a good story?  Kind of, yeah.  All right.  We can tell that next.  What the hell?  We'll give away more of our TV project that might fly, might not, by the way.  We have no idea.  There's so much footage.  There really is a lot of footage.  It all comes down to the edit and what they can make out of it, and then we see what Comedy 
[00:23:00]  Central says.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show just getting started.  We packed a full house today.  We got Nick DiPaolo coming back today.  We got Mike Birbiglia stopping in the studio today.  He's doing something special at Caroline's, like three or four different shows and three  nights or something.  I don't know.  He'll explain.  And then later on this morning, Leslie Nielsen will be calling the radio show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A if you got anything. 
[00:23:30]  Good morning to everybody.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss.  And now Nick DiPaolo as well.  I got to start with Rich Voss, who's playing Poughkeepsie's.  Poughkeepsie's?  Well, bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Hey, that would be a good club.  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie's.  Well, that's why I'm bringing this up, because I'm all confused, because I'm reading the Rich  Voss plug.  Yeah.  And it says bananas in Poughkeepsie. 
[00:24:00]  That's where Rich Voss is going to be tonight and tomorrow.  Rich Voss spelled Poughkeepsie, P, which is good.  That's a start.  O-Q-U-I-P-S-E.  Ooh.  Poughkeepsie.  That's a black girl's name.  Yo, Poughkeepsie.  For the people all over America, just trust me, it's not even close.  No.  But if you break it down phonetically, it's still a Holiday Inn. 
[00:24:30]  It's still a Holiday Inn.  Basically.  It still means your career is stagnant.  I'm sorry, Rich.  It's okay.  I'm very happy with my career.  You know what's funny?  People have no idea that we're actually really good friends, because we just don't play it  that way on the air.  That's all right.  My chick goes, you actually shared a room with him when you played Doral?  Well, I'm like, yeah, we were both lonely, man.  It was three nights we stayed in a hotel and a resort. 
[00:25:00]  Was it three nights?  Yeah, it was like, yeah, definitely.  In the same room?  Yeah.  What is wrong with you guys?  I wanted a roommate.  Are you kidding me?  I didn't want sex or any of that crap.  I just wanted a roommate.  I was lonely.  I was just wandering around.  Lonely?  I was wandering around the country.  Rich Voss calls me up.  He's like, hey, I got this great deal.  We could go down to Doral and play where Tiger Woods plays.  And the PGA plays.  And South Beach is what?  A mere half hour, 40 minutes away? 
[00:25:30]  Not even.  It was 20 minutes.  Over the bridge.  Over the bridge.  Like 20 minutes.  And we both decide, what the hell?  We'll just share a room.  What am I going to do?  Go back to like a room by myself and just sit there and stare at the wall?  Well, see, here's the thing.  I would never.  Yeah?  I didn't know.  Like, one night we're laying in bed, not together.  After that crack story, I doubted.  He has a pair of hot pants on.  He's sponing with them.  All right.  I had a wetsuit.  And we're laying in a separate bed.  And it starts off with like one depressing story about your childhood. 
[00:26:00]  And it goes from my story to his stories.  And his are starting to really bum me out.  It's hard to do.  However, you grew up.  I thought I had some depressing bad story.  Wait, which story bummed you out?  Do you remember?  I don't remember.  But, you know, I don't know.  Maybe your mother up in the attic or something.  Oh, yeah.  We used to find her in the attic every once in a while.  Yeah.  She needed a timeout.  What's her last name?  Frank?  Yeah.  My mom needed timeouts.  We would have to go search for her.  And we found her in the attic a couple times. 
[00:26:30]  That's actually a true story.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Why was she up there?  She's, you know, got issues there.  Dusting?  Haven't you been around long enough?  You don't need to ask why.  Just look at me.  What do you think?  No, I haven't, actually.  Look at the one side of me.  And then you can figure it all out.  But that was the one that depressed you?  I don't know.  It just was, you know.  But then it was like, you know, then we were playing top this, basically.  And then Rich is telling his horrible stories.  And we're sitting there.  We're almost ready to start cuddling and slide each other's shoulder. 
[00:27:00]  Almost.  Then it was time to sleep.  And then this idiot has to wake up in the middle of the night to smoke cigarettes.  Jesus.  Still on that health kick, Rich?  That was.  Well, he stopped smoking, finally.  But he was so addicted to the nicotine that he would wake up in the middle of the night  to have smokes.  And he's half asleep, just drooling, having a cigarette.  The cigarette is, like, falling out of his mouth as he's falling back to sleep.  He's going to burn you up.  Right.  Then we play golf.  And you've heard the story. 
[00:27:30]  Jackass breaks his hand in the sand trap.  So now I have a crippled, depressed guy in my room that I can play golf with.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, so that's what led you to making out with the grandma?  We met these.  What?  I almost said he's hot chicks.  We met these girls now.  Hot chicks?  I almost said the grandma.  They're not the girls.  The grandma was Johnny Winter's mother, basically.  She was an albino.  This woman was an albino hippie with the weird blue eyes.  Yeah.  Not the cool blue eyes.  Almost like the albino eyes. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  They're like faded gene eyes.  Yeah.  Okay.  So we're both single at the time.  But the daughter was hot.  And he had a nice-  She had some awful Indian name, I remember.  Hiawatha.  Hiawatha.  Hiawatha.  She was like some hippie kid.  You know, the mom name.  Yeah.  It was between that or Granola.  You know what I mean?  Or Sunshine.  Yeah.  And so the girl, the hot one, was going towards Opie, you know?  Because maybe, whatever.  She was-  He's going to try to rationalize it.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, whatever. 
[00:28:30]  Maybe it was the cast on his hand.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a mother-daughter combo.  So to say she was hot, compared to the mother, she was hot.  Yes.  And Opie had no-  I don't think he had a rap, but I tried to take one on the team, you know?  Take one for the team.  Wait, I didn't have a-  Not on the team.  I didn't have a rap because I didn't want her.  Oh.  Well-  You were desperate for sex, so you're like-  You go walking off at the-  Where were we?  The Delano?  Some hotel area.  Some really fancy, like, trendy hotel.  We decided to go to the pool area. 
[00:29:00]  There's a pool area where you sit in these cabanas.  Cabanas.  And we're all sitting, having a drink.  Rich doesn't drink, so he's drinking whatever.  And the mom is an alcoholic.  And we're in this cabana, just hanging out, having a nice night.  It's a beautiful night in South Beach.  All of a sudden, Rich gives some kind of look to the mom and walks off with her to another  cabana and starts making out with her.  Could you tell her it was a teepee?  And that's when Hiawatha, whatever the hell her name was, said that, you know, she's actually 
[00:29:30]  a grandma.  She looked like-  It's all right.  She looked like the blonde in Billy Jack that was tied to the stakes.  What?  She had white hair.  Way back.  What's that?  Billy Jack movie?  Rich, we're not all 60 here.  Oh, wow.  All right.  That's a trial, Billy Jack.  Billy Jack.  Where'd the guy dinner on the beach?  She looked like Richard Widmark and that.  And you know what the worst is, though?  When you're making out with a 60-year-old lady, it's not that.  She wasn't- I bet you in her day, she was hot.  You know?  Well-  It would have been a good story if I would have closed the deal, right?  That's wonderful.  A lot of chicks would be hot if you could get a time machine. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  But her breasts stunk, too.  Her breasts stunk.  God, what a winner.  What the hell is that about?  I don't know.  Maybe because when you're 60 or something, I don't know.  Maybe your breast starts, like, rotting away.  Oh, her breast.  I thought you said her breast.  No, her breast.  They probably did, too.  I thought you said breast.  No, her breast.  Like an old lady baby powder.  Her breast stunk.  Well, she's an Indian.  Her liver's probably rotten.  Bruh.  Okay.  We laughed pretty hard, though. 
[00:30:30]  We had some good times.  Good times.  So, yeah.  Can I tell this quick story about going to the doctor yesterday?  Should I tell it?  Can I tell it?  Yeah, since that one went by so fast.  Oh, this is what you wrote down before the break?  Yeah.  I don't know why that came up.  But, yeah, we shared a room.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  Two guys.  You know what it was?  I didn't realize that I would make a little money.  Two guys, one bed.  What?  I just wouldn't share a room like that. 
[00:31:00]  We did.  And I shared a room once.  We had to.  But we were both really poor at the time, and they flew us out to L.A., and we had to  share a room.  They made us.  That was very awkward.  Sounds like a Barry Katz gig.  I know.  I got to be bumped up to a first class, too, on my gold, then.  You didn't have freaking flyer miles or something.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  I got them bumped up.  Isn't that something?  You know, I took them under my wings, then.  You know, I said, the guy, you know, he bounced around.  Little hummingbird wings, you call his hands.  He bounced around.  Not under his wing.  Under his wing.  Yeah, wings. 
[00:31:30]  Both of them.  I'm telling you, a pilot for Delta.  I have a...  When you were spooning, you took them under your wings.  I think Rich Voss secretly wants to date me, because then we went...  That last summer, was it last summer that I decided to go play golf with you, and you  showed up with a nice little lunch for me?  Well, I mean...  That's a sad story, too.  That's not sad.  I'm not going to kiss him.  We show up to play golf, it's like, you know, at the halfway house, you can get a hot  dog and a beer or whatever the hell you want.  All of a sudden, Rich goes, I packed this lunch, and he pulls out a nice little, little 
[00:32:00]  like, cooler.  It had a nice juicy...  I think he got me a juice box or something.  Were you just sitting in the middle of the fairway on a checkered blanket?  Right.  With the old-time basket.  What did you make me?  Some bread.  It was like egg salad and...  What was it again?  Old-time basket.  Wait, what was the lunch?  Seriously.  It was egg salad.  Did you cut the crust off it for him, honey?  Yes, I cut the egg salad.  I'm not going to...  It was an egg salad sandwich.  I think it was like an apple, a piece of fruit, and like a juice box. 
[00:32:30]  I take my portion, and I go, and I threw it in the garbage in front of him.  I'm not going to make myself lunch and eat in front of somebody, so I...  Really?  Yeah.  Where did you get manners?  No kidding.  Bonnie?  And there's other places to buy stuff to eat at a golf course.  Yeah, that's a...  So you didn't have to.  You could have packed your own lunch and been, you know, the cheapo that you are, and then  let Oak be...  Oh, I'm not cheap.  I'm far from cheap.  I'll spend some money.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Sure.  I just like a good deal, too, though. 
[00:33:00]  Of course you do.  Spend some money.  What's with the territory?  Boss is all about the good deal, man.  I like a good deal.  Oh, I'm sure when you guys split that room, it was just like, oh, this is great.  Oh, half the price.  I subbed the couch to another person we didn't even know.  I was lonely.  I was lonely.  So, yeah, you packed me a nice little lunch that I...  I'm sorry.  ...that I threw in the garbage, because I honestly, you know, that was creepy. 
[00:33:30]  Sharing a room wasn't creepy to me, but making me a lunch, now you're going over the line.  Now you're getting a little weird.  You two are creeps.  We're all just a bunch of messes.  Who are you kidding, man?  Anthony, it reminds me I have an omelet in the green room.  Right.  Hey, let's go.  Join you for breakfast.  We'll do brunch.  And then the famous story where this ass is more concerned about how well he hit his wedge from 90 yards out that he doesn't bother to yell four as I'm standing there on the green wondering where the shot's going. 
[00:34:00]  He was trying to bargain it down to two.  And to this day, to this day, I got a lump on my hand.  Well, you know what?  Because I'm holding...  You know how...  You play golf, Nick?  No, I don't.  Okay.  I know enough about it, though.  I'm not gay.  A lot of guys, if you're on the green, you got your putter, you kind of almost use it as a cane.  You're leaning on your putter, your hand's fully exposed.  Yes.  And I'm right behind the pin because I'm like, Voss is 90 yards out. 
[00:34:30]  I'm like, he's not going to stick this.  So I'll stand right near the pin.  That's usually a safe bet, right?  So I'm watching Voss hit, and he's not saying anything, and I'm trying to figure out where the ball is.  He's not saying anything, not saying anything.  Next thing I know, I got excruciating pain because the freaking wedge shot hits me perfect right on the top.  Look at the lump.  It's still there.  Two years later, it's still there.  Hold on a minute.  First of all, I go down like I got shot.  Like a Kennedy.  I really went down like I got shot, immediately start bleeding because it was one of those deep bruises that brought blood right to the surface. 
[00:35:00]  Really?  Yes.  That's the Irish in you.  Yes.  He's the bleeder.  I said, you don't even have to.  I said, don't putt.  Don't worry.  I'll give you the putt.  Okay.  Right before that, he was crying because he had a tick on him.  Okay.  He had a little tick on his.  A little tick.  It was a tick.  Did you remove that in the room for him after the egg salad salad?  He did suck out the poison for me, which I appreciate it. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you, Rich.  And where was that tick?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know what?  Apparently, I had another parasite with you called Rich Voss.  I'll tell you why I had a tick.  Because this ass doesn't know how to lose a golf ball.  We all lose golf balls, not Rich Voss.  He's a good golfer, Rich.  No, no, no.  He's not in your thing enough.  He'll spend forever looking for it.  Thank you.  He hits bad shots like anyone, but what he has to do is find every single ball that he  hits into the deep weeds where the ticks freaking live. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, really?  The ticks stop at the woods.  They don't head out to the fairway.  It's like a little tick ray, you know, an electrical tick fence.  Guys, this is it.  We can't head out there.  I hit the ball a little to the left.  And I went to look for my ball because I didn't want to take a stroke.  No, you didn't want to buy another one.  No, please.  He starts with a Nike ball.  He starts with a Nike ball.  By the time we're on the green putting, it's like a top flight XL.  The only way you know that is because there was an imprint of top flight on your hand. 
[00:36:30]  That's the only way you would know something like that.  A ball that was lost in like 1988, he finds.  It goes, I found my ball and hits that one.  It doesn't take a stroke.  Anyway.  I can't play golf with him anymore.  Some weeks he's going to get hurt.  Yeah.  Or pregnant.  Let's share a bed at Durrell.  All right, I'll be right down.  Yeah.  That sounds exciting.  I got a couple of drunk squaws at the pool.  I didn't even bring my clubs. 
[00:37:00]  He does.  He does.  We were just hanging out.  What were the news cafe or whatever it was down there on South Beach?  Oh, I've been there.  And it's a hip little place to be seen.  You're hanging.  You're having some coffee and drinks, whatever.  And he decides to go after the two ugliest people in the joint.  It's South Beach.  It's a good strategy, though.  It's South Beach, though.  The place is like just dripping with models.  Desperate models.  And you decide the grandma that looks good. 
[00:37:30]  First of all, they are models.  And so are the guys.  Okay?  We're like threes.  And there's nothing but tens walking by.  That are, you know, from...  Then again, can you imagine?  Well, he's sitting there with his guest shirt.  And I have this ugly diesel shirt.  This diesel shirt that looks like a doily, a pastry.  We're sitting here like two...  The odd couple.  It's just horrible.  And all these guys are walking by.  They can tell we're from out of...  We're dressing like we think you're supposed to dress in South Beach. 
[00:38:00]  So we're so out of place.  And can you imagine if we did end up picking up those two girls and explain that we're sharing a room?  Yeah.  See, we're sharing a room.  Could you guys not pay attention to...  I know it's kind of awkward being in here with your mother.  Like we're back in high school.  You're doing a make-out session right next to your bud.  It's kind of weird being in here with the out-of-work DJ and the guy that took third place this year on Last Comic. 
[00:38:30]  Because we don't have money for our own room.  Not only was she a grandma, she was an albino.  People don't understand.  She had like transparent eyes, basically.  A hippie albino.  Yes.  I always liked Edgar Winner, so I figured what the heck.  I'd like to bang her.  And you set the sights low, which is kind of good for South Beach.  These girls are so...  Because you know you have no rap in there.  What am I going to do down there?  That's what cocaine is for.  I know.  That's right.  You're right.  It makes you a nine.  It does.  Hold the drugs out.  You're right. 
[00:39:00]  Donna Trucker is asking if Voss dressed extra sexy, hoping that I would pick up the room tab.  Linger longer.  All right.  So you went to the doctor yesterday, Rich, because you wrote this note before break.  Part of this pilot, just one little thing that happened in the pilot is I got my ass smacked.  And the handprint, they took a magic marker and outlined the handprint, right?  Okay.  Okay.  And we did so much stuff that day.  Well, one person was smacked, might just smacked my ass.  Yeah.  We're trying to keep it a little vague.  A little vague.  Okay.  So much went on that day. 
[00:39:30]  That happened.  Okay.  And I have a handprint on my, a magic marker, an outline of the handprint on my bus.  So I go home.  I shower or whatever.  You know, when you shower, you just hit your butt.  You don't, you know, scrub it down with sandpaper.  You don't realize.  You don't remember.  So yesterday I had to go to the doctor and I had my prostate.  And so I, first of all, I'm untressed.  What is he like?  Is that the handprint of the last doctor?  I know.  I, I, I, I got.  Your ass looks like man's Chinese theater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many guys have, have done you that they're leaving their handprints in memory? 
[00:40:00]  John Wayne.  Right.  There's nothing worse than sitting there.  You're sitting naked on the, on the metal table with a piece of paper over you.  That's not your doctor.  It's a butcher shop.  I know.  I was strong.  And so the doctor, he goes, you know, why do you have a handprint?  And then he said, oh, I guess it was a Comedy Central pilot.  Right.  He knew it, but it was just embarrassing getting his finger next to the handprint.  Then they took a telescope to size probably a little thicker than this. 
[00:40:30]  That's radio.  Stuck it in.  Are you pointing at?  Than this.  It could be a cinder block.  It could be a pin.  A basic.  It's radio.  Oh.  They stuck it in.  Are you allowed to say penis?  I think you're going to say penis.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You can say that.  That's not.  You can say the word, but you can't say.  I'm doing a medical procedure.  I got a great prostate bit.  You want me to do mine instead?  No, this is true.  Yesterday.  Wait, so it was the size of what?  Like a Miller Lite can? 
[00:41:00]  No, like a table.  Thicker than Hillary's ankle?  Just help us out here.  We have to help things for straights?  Come on.  A pencil.  They took.  A pencil?  They shot a gel.  About as thick as a pencil.  I know.  I know.  Into here.  You've done that?  Oh, no.  In the front.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's what I said.  In the front.  Oh, no.  They went to.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  We got a yield sign here.  Wait, so it was as thick as a pencil. 
[00:41:30]  And let's just say.  Yeah, about a little thicker than a pencil.  And let's just say.  Instead of going.  Talking about his neck?  What are we doing?  Instead of going back.  They went front.  Just say that.  Really?  At first, they took a tube and shot gel down there.  Like lubricant.  Whoa.  Oh, God.  This is killing every guy listening.  Whoa.  And then the nurse comes in, too.  Right.  And they got a clamp on it.  They got this metal clamp.  What did you say to the nurse?  Tight, huh?  How are you?  Jiffy Lobe?  What's going on? 
[00:42:00]  And then they took.  They took this.  Are we good?  Let me know if they're dumping.  Because this is.  They can't dump it.  It's a metal.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  They stick it down in through my unit.  Okay.  And the doctor's got a telescope.  That's a better way of doing it now, actually.  Well, to look at your bladder.  And he has the other end of a tube.  And he's looking through like a microscope with his tube into my.  All right.  And he sees a guy looking the other way right back at him.  And he goes, did you share a room at Doral with him? 
[00:42:30]  It was the most.  Now, whenever I go to bed, still, it's unbelievable pain.  What's a marrow of your bladder?  Nothing.  They weren't checking it out because I got a big cyst on my kidney.  So they were checking my whole, you know, because there's blood in my urine.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Are you a mess?  What?  Why don't.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got to.  I got to get this.  You've talked about the growth on your kidney.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why don't they cut you open and look at it and say, all right, we're taking it out.  I am in a week and a half. 
[00:43:00]  They're going to drain it.  Will you bring it in here in a jar?  Drain it.  I got to.  We could do something with that.  No, it's just.  It's full of liquid.  It's a cyst.  What do you think?  It's full of confetti, you idiot.  It's a pinata on his kidney.  A bunch of baby Snickers bars.  I see a bunch of little Mexicans hit you with a bath.  Yeah.  So it's a cyst.  They're going to drain it in two weeks.  Yeah.  Really?  They stick, you know, I go to.  They stick a needle through, like, in your back.  Whatever, yeah.  Or your side.  And they drain the cyst. 
[00:43:30]  That's got to be.  Because I saw the CAT scan.  I was going to bring it in, but I'll bring it in after I use it at the, what do you call it?  At the hospital.  But I saw the CAT scan yesterday, and I'm looking at it.  And he goes, this is your kidney.  Plus, I have a kidney stone here, too.  This is your kidney on drugs.  Yeah.  And then he goes, and this is the cyst, and it's just a big, black, round.  Oh, my God.  That's why they want to play Keith.  Did he say what it's.  Look like a crazy thumb.  Did he say what it's full of?  Huh?  What is it full of?  V8 juice.  Yeah.  It's a cyst full of water. 
[00:44:00]  Water.  What's that from?  Now, is that from drinking and stuff when you're young?  Do you damage your kidneys?  I'm hoping.  Right now, a lot of people have cysts on their kidneys.  You probably, you don't even know.  It's not a problem.  Oh, stop.  Don't try.  Don't try.  Yeah, we're fine.  You and Shimla ought to get a room together.  Everybody has AIDS.  It's just what everybody has.  And then some people, you get it worse than others.  Yeah, thanks.  What is that?  Kidneys are fine. 
[00:44:30]  That's right.  Everyone out there has a brain tumor.  When's the last time you went in for a CAT scan?  For a CAT scan?  Yeah, you know, like, yeah, they look on the inside, a CAT scan.  I know what a CAT scan is, stupid.  All right.  What's the last time you have?  I don't know.  Probably, I probably didn't need one.  You don't just go in and go, could you have a full, like, CAT scan of my body?  Something has to hurt.  Something has to, so you probably had a pain in your kidney.  I had some stomach pains.  So they did a CAT scan, found this frigging conjoined twin on your kidney. 
[00:45:00]  So the doctor says, you know, a lot of people get cysts, but it's just that yours is the  size of a baseball.  That's why we got to.  Wow.  It's about.  Good for you.  I know.  Why don't you have somebody sign that?  Tell it on eBay.  Get Jeter to sign it.  You should throw out the first tumor at Shea Stadium this year.  No one ever takes a baseball and goes, this is about the size of a cyst.  Right.  It's filled with yoo-hoo.  Jesus. 
[00:45:30]  My God, man.  You got a lot of, but he looks pretty good for an ex-crack addict fit.  What are you, 50 or 50?  It's going to be 51 in June.  51.  Oh.  I'm still doing well with the grandmas.  Picking up your albino grandmother.  I don't know.  We've told that story many times, I know, but I still don't think we did that whole story  justice.  But you get new listeners and it's always.  No, I know.  We get more into it.  Like we, in the beginning, we just said, yeah, we shared a room at Darrell.  Yeah.  I got another couple.  And then Hiawatha, whatever, she lived in Orlando and I was heading back that way after 
[00:46:00]  I met up with you.  Oh, did you give her a ride?  No, she wanted me to call her.  No, she was on a pony.  She wanted me to call her when I got to Orlando.  I'm like, eh.  You know what it is when you're sitting on a cell.  Huh?  Good looking?  She was all right.  She was all right.  She doesn't even come close to his.  Dragging a little travoy behind her all the way to Orlando.  You know.  Help her sell the beaver pelts back to Orlando. 
[00:46:30]  Huh?  You know what?  It's when you're on South Beach, you want to feel like you're a part of and you want  to walk away with something kind of, you know what I mean?  Like a cyst on your ovaries.  If you're a person that suffers from depression, don't go to South Beach.  You'll kill yourself.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I fit right in there.  I'm ripped.  Like you've got a big unit.  There it is.  If you think you're.  A man with some pride.  Finally.  If you think you're somebody and you walk around South Beach, you realize you're just. 
[00:47:00]  You, you, you, you just.  You know what it is, though.  Here it is.  You're a genetic disaster.  I'm trying to say.  I got to be honest with you, though.  You got to use what you got a little bit.  Who?  You.  If you were in that situation.  If I'm hanging out with a rich boss down in South Beach.  Yeah.  And, and he's picking up grandmas.  Yeah.  I am going to be flashing cash, drugs, booze, whatever it takes to get one of those hot,  long legged girls down there and not have to get Voss's frigging throwaway daughters from, 
[00:47:30]  from the old bag he's making out with.  Oh.  What you need is a handful of date rape drugs.  There you go.  You know what, though?  In a way.  Hey, look at that.  Doink.  Plop, plop.  You know what?  Plop.  In a way, though, it was, it was, I don't know, it was, it was, it was entertaining that  it went down that way.  He had a, you know what I mean?  He left with a broken hand and I went and got a tooth pulled, too.  Oh, I forgot.  In between rounds.  What happened? 
[00:48:00]  In between rounds.  Would she give you a gingivitis?  In between, like, instant pyorrhea.  In between playing Doral.  I forgot about that.  He had to go to a dentist one day.  I'm sitting there in the freaking room waiting for Rich because he's getting a tooth removed.  You're on a three-day little jaunt and he's getting surgery.  Jesus.  You might as well have went with Jack Klugman.  My throat's infected.  Let's play another thing.  I forgot about that.  That he's, like, miserable because he can't talk.  He teeth pulled. 
[00:48:30]  The fifth appendix is coming out.  He's getting corrective surgery on his eyes.  He looks healthy, too.  He's got a broken hand.  I got a tooth pulled.  I got to go to Alabama.  I was rejected by a six-year-old lady.  I'm sharing the room.  It wasn't a bad trip.  It sounds like a real blast, guys.  What a mess.  From some bootleg dentist in a strip mall.  I just said dentist on it.  Oh, great.  I need a tooth pulled.  It was so much. 
[00:49:00]  My whole face was swollen.  Of course it was.  It was just bad.  But anyway, I also smell a Coke Logic animation.  This one needs to be animated.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we got to take a break.  Nick DiPaolo is here.  Nick, this is the tease when we get back.  Remember yesterday when you were here with this Larry Sinclair guy, Gurney and all that?  Yeah.  We got an update.  Oh, you do?  Well, we really thought we had a massive exclusive for the Opie and Anthony show.  Turns out, what, he was on Jerry Springer two weeks ago?  Right.  We'll explain next. 
[00:49:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Here, check it out, Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss filling in for Jim Norton.  Also invited Nick DiPaolo back today.  Nick killed for us yesterday.  Nick should be on the radio.  Thank you, Al.  Oh, yeah.  Nick got effed.  We were doing like a free FM here in New York, and he was one of the guys, and he was building  a fine little audience for himself. 
[00:50:00]  And then the company said, ah, that's not working, so let's move on to the next format.  Who's the program director?  And when that happens, you know, good broadcasters get kicked to the side, and Nick is one of  the good broadcasters that got kicked to the side.  I don't know who the programmer was at that point.  No, now who is it?  It's a woman, right?  No, she's gone now, too.  Oh, right.  Jesus.  And I think they just named somebody that, I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, there's a new program director.  We went back.  Alan Seuss.  We came back to regular radio almost two years ago, just under two years, and we've 
[00:50:30]  been through, I think, four PDs.  Yeah.  Three GMs.  I don't know.  They keep getting fragged by the staff.  Wow.  And three different formats.  This is what radio has become.  I would take the job as a program director.  I'm open.  But you're doing blog TV.  Yeah.  So you went from, you know, broadcasting in New York City to-  That's not what my career is.  I do that to, you know, I can sit home and make a few bucks, but that's for fun.  It's like a bang.  But I was just, it's kind of pathetic, though. 
[00:51:00]  You went from broadcasting in New York City to doing something in your basement.  I'm trying to help you out here, Nick.  How is that helping?  You're like my manager, for Christ's sake.  How is that helping?  Pushing him in front of a bus isn't really helping him in any possible way.  I want him to be pissed.  I want to be-  You went from broadcast radio in New York City to your basement, and that's not fair.  You're talking to a walkie-talkie to a friend down the block.  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just doing it to keep my chops up. 
[00:51:30]  You never know when WRKO might come calling.  Dale Dorman.  I want to be back on the radio.  I love it.  You just went local for Boston.  Very nice.  I know, and that's stupid.  That's right, you're in Boston.  I hear the block TV thing is doing well.  Well, yeah, it's just fun.  I mean, it's fun to be- I'm sitting there with a camera, and people are watching me in my  basement, and I'm talking to people in Tel Aviv in South Africa, and they know my stuff  from Comedy Central.  That's nice.  And of course, my manager had nothing to do with this.  I found it on my own.  A dick.  Are you really talking- 
[00:52:00]  Are you really-  See, there's the idea I want.  What are you saying to them in Africa?  What am I saying?  I like your policies over there.  There goes another one.  Again, it's South Africa.  Do you have to do a lot of clicking?  Like-  I got-  Actually, I'm leaving here today.  I'm going to Voss's doctor to have a lip plate put in.  How does your-  And his sister move at the same time.  How does your comedy translate when they have to, you know-  It's-  No, there's only a few-  It's mostly my-  I'll make it sound like there's a-  All of Zimbabwe is just loving Nick. 
[00:52:30]  But this is so cool.  He's now a king in Zimbabwe.  If you go to nickdip.com, or go to blog.tv, you can find me.  But go to nick.com, and if you register on my forum, when I do the blog.tv show, you're  automatically in the chat room.  I didn't know how to control the chat room at first.  You have to like-  And all people's come pouring in, and they just say mean stuff to you.  Of course.  Even me.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  I mean, just getting delusional.  Fing you dirty, stupid guinea-  This vicious stuff, you know? 
[00:53:00]  Finally, I learned how to control the chat room.  So, just the people that go to my website and register are in there.  Okay.  But it's like a couple hundred fans.  I got a website.  So, I got a webcam.  If you have a webcam, I can click on your name, and you become my co-host.  It's really hilarious.  I mean, I'm getting paid.  He can just pick a co-host like that.  Yes.  Let me tell you what Nick is doing, and it's brilliant.  Nick is a married man, and he has figured out how to go on Pal Talk and see hot chicks.  You know, are you helping him out again?  And get paid for it. 
[00:53:30]  His wife is like, all right, you go down in the basement and do your block TV.  I'll be up here, and Nick's down there, and he's checking out hot chicks.  No, believe me.  She taps into the show at any time.  All right.  I see her face in the chat room.  I'm like, get out of here.  What did you say about-  But, yeah, the girl's real cute.  The girl in Tel Aviv who worked for this company, she's a Jewish girl.  She went to NYU.  Her name's Kara, and she's like 23, and she's really cute and smart, and she's got like a filthy mouth.  Wow.  She's a great co-host.  Perfect co-host. 
[00:54:00]  And she knows all my stuff from Comedy Central.  She's reciting jokes to me.  She lives in Tel Aviv.  Oh, you're going to hook up at some point.  No, I can't.  I love my wife.  She's terrific.  Is it refreshing to be uncensored, knowing you've got people breathing down your neck?  Exactly.  I mean, you say anything, you know?  Anything goes.  I mean, anything.  It's probably-  Here's Stig.  I record some of the segments.  Oh.  And once I do that, you can, like, anybody can watch them.  Yeah.  And now my wife's like, what are you-  You're going to trash your career over a basement show, you idiot? 
[00:54:30]  I've got to check this out.  Now you've got my interest.  Nickdip.com.  That's one word.  Nickdip.com.  And register on the forum, and then go to Blog TV, and you can find me.  I'm doing April 2nd at 9 p.m.  I'm like the featured comedian on Blog TV.  I usually do it in the afternoon at, like, 3 or 4.  But, yeah, April 2nd, I'm doing it at 9 at night.  April 4th, I'm doing it at 4 p.m.  But it's hilarious.  You can see my finished basement.  People are making fun of my house.  First of all, you're the featured comedian, but it's your show. 
[00:55:00]  So aren't you, every day, the featured comedian when you-  No, there's a few people doing this.  There's only, like, three.  Me and Joe Rogan, like, two other people are doing this.  I swear to God.  That's it.  It's, like, brand new, you know?  It's the future.  Jesus, I'm on Stupid Pal Talk all night.  I ought to do that.  I ought to do it.  You guys are getting deals at comedy.  I'm sitting in the green room listening to you guys doing pilots at comedy.  Oh, sorry.  I have a relationship with you guys.  I have a relationship with a comedy sample for 15 years, and I don't even know about this.  And my dink manager goes, yeah, Rich Voss, I think he just did some deal with it. 
[00:55:30]  And I'm like, you're stupid.  I'm sitting here learning.  All my friends at O.B. and Anthony in a comedy sample are doing crap, and I'm sitting up at my house.  You know how that goes.  I don't even know if they're going to figure it out.  I do know how it goes.  If I'm not involved, it's going to be a huge hit, O.B.  You don't have a black cloud.  You guys, everything you touch is gold.  Unfortunately, we have Voss on it, so that balance.  He balances it out.  It's like a sift.  Who said that once?  You've killed more pilots than Al-Qaeda?  Oh, God.  I said that in a run. 
[00:56:00]  It's unbelievable how the money they put into these things, and they just, eh, nah, we're not using it.  You know what?  Don't give me the pilot.  Just give me half the money for now on.  Yeah, we'll see.  Oh, you just want half the money?  They gave you that much money?  No, my pilot, the last one.  Oh, you and the wife?  Three what?  No.  No, three.  Yeah, $300.  It was, they put out so much money for this pilot.  It's funny.  I got 12 pounds.  And you did it with your wife?  Yeah.  Well, and we, two, I did two with her, and I did the one with Patrice. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's, you just, and you know what it is?  I, the one you guys did, I'm not just saying this because it's you two, because you got,  but I think, no, I'm sure.  You are.  You know why I think it's going to go?  Because it fits their demographics.  Ah, we'll see.  It's a pretty good idea.  We'll see.  You know, I just.  Hey, we got to move on, though, Rich.  We'll see.  We'll talk about pilots later on.  Not what.  I'm plugging my website like it's a legit thing.  Jesus, what happened?  You're right, Ope, not I'm thinking about it.  I just want to get you mad, because.  Go to NickTheFile.com. 
[00:57:00]  We were on this Larry Sinclair story yesterday.  We were very excited.  We thought we really were on to something.  This is the gentleman that came up with this story that years ago, back in 1999,  he had done drugs and had certain sexual favors that he gave to Obama.  Right.  And he made a YouTube video.  He made a YouTube video.  And the video is very convincing.  Is it?  Jimmy and I really believe that the guy believes what he's saying on this video. 
[00:57:30]  So you think he's a kook now, then?  He believes it.  I'm not saying it's true.  Maybe it was some, and then we were speculating that maybe it was some guy that said he was  Obama, and the guy just decides.  Yeah, but back in 1999, no one would say, I'm Obama, because no one really knew Obama.  Locally, they did.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  You know, locally.  And here's the video.  Here's the audio.  In Gurney, this made us laugh all day yesterday.  Here's the audio of the video, just in case you missed it.  I think the video was linked to ONAradio.com yesterday.  Hi, my name is Larry Sinclair. 
[00:58:00]  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and  Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999 in the Chicago, Illinois  area.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming  public.  Done greatly.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois. 
[00:58:30]  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink.  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed sex on Senate.  That's my favorite part.  I got stuff to take.  The fact that he got coke for him and crack for himself.  I need some powdered coke and some crack.  This guy sounds like you're tested on Project Runway.  And he obtained it? 
[00:59:00]  Like, wouldn't you send the limo driver out?  Right.  Give him a few bucks and go, hey.  Wouldn't he know where to get the drugs?  Maybe you don't want to go searching around for coke and crack.  Right.  And also, if you're driving around in a limo, do you need somebody to buy your coke for  you?  I think you have that kind of money, right?  If you're in a limo.  Yeah, but like, you don't want to do it yourself.  Yes, you do.  Why?  You want to isolate.  You want to do as much as you can.  And you don't want to have to talk.  You just want to sit, do coke, and drink, and smoke. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, but what happens if you get caught in some kind of a sting operation?  You're a politician.  You're buying your own coke?  No, I'm...  It's crazy.  No, I'm saying the other guy.  Why would he hook up with Obama?  It was his limo.  It wasn't Obama's limo, was it?  Well, he was the limo driver.  Yeah.  I am really dumb.  All right, I'm just going back to the tape.  Began to drink.  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, and crack cocaine for his use.  I'm sorry.  I performed sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the state 
[01:00:00]  of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is  limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were a state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in Gurney, 
[01:00:30]  Illinois, two days later.  Bernie.  If you challenge the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph test, as  I will submit to as well.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public.  Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Thank you.  Now, it sounds like he's telling the truth, right?  Or at least he believes what he's saying.  That sounds like a nut.  I say that he absolutely sounds like a nut on top of that. 
[01:01:00]  His unit in a lineup, and had the guy pick it out.  Do you honestly think, too, that Obama would even entertain this guy?  Like, okay, get that polygraph.  Let me legitimize this guy.  Yeah, he's looking at his schedule.  Oh, we got to fit the Larry Sinclair controversy.  It's my day today.  Two days later, like it was in the back of the limo, and two days later, Obama's like,  I just got to get some more of that guy.  Yeah, that was some good stuff.  I got to get more of that.  Right here at Gurney.  How much does this guy hate Obama? 
[01:01:30]  Isn't he an hardcore racist?  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't sound white.  He is white.  He doesn't sound white.  He sounds very white.  Sounds like a white girl.  He's white.  And he's being a real martyr for the cause.  He's awesome.  Going up and going, hey, I performed this on, you know, this gentleman.  I would imagine that some guys in black suits and some, like, black sunglasses knocked  on Larry Sinclair's door is like, you're going to have to take one for the team, my friend.  This is the equivalent of, this is like an American suicide bombing. 
[01:02:00]  You're pretty much killing yourself for the greater good of your cause, I guess.  How much is the Hillary campaign paying this guy to do this?  Look, sit down.  You're going to have to admit that you do some drugs and that, yeah, you know.  Take one for the team.  You're taking this for the cause, my friend.  So we looked up Larry Sinclair, very excited.  He called us back.  Yeah.  And we were going to have our exclusive interview with Larry Sinclair today.  But what do we got, Steve?  Well, he called back, very eager to be on the program last night. 
[01:02:30]  And I'm dating him this weekend.  Yes, exactly.  We're taking the limo out with my assless chaps.  Thank you so much, Anthony.  Which, funny enough, all chaps are assless when you really think about it.  Why do I even bother coming in?  Because Anthony already knows the answer.  I love how Steve tries to deflect by doing...  By doing the impression of Steve.  Right.  It's really, you've just got to jump in with both feet on these.  Yes.  Both feet, please.  Tight, huh?  Thank you so much. 
[01:03:00]  Okay, segment over.  No.  No, no, no.  So you get Larry Sinclair on the phone.  Well, Larry Sinclair did submit to a polygraph, two, actually, back in February of 2008.  And both experts indicated that his results indicated deception in regards to his sex life.  Ah.  Now, what color were the guys who gave the polygraph to?  Yeah.  Both Caucasian.  Back in February, she said it would have been last month. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I know.  Thank you, Rich.  I know.  Two weeks ago.  Back in two weeks ago.  Yeah, you don't have to sound that official, Steve.  Back in two.  A month ago, he took a test and he failed.  It's almost April.  Yeah.  In February 2008, which is a month ago, he took a polygraph.  He was offered $10,000 to take the polygraph.  He accepted and he failed.  Yeah.  Oh, so he got money.  He got paid?  Yeah, he got paid.  Well, what kind of deal is that?  White House.com, which used to be a porn site.  Oh, right. 
[01:04:00]  Paid him $10,000, which was going to be $100,000 if he passed the polygraph.  He failed.  Oh, wow.  I would have studied.  I got a story about me and Hillary in the back of an El Camino.  Yeah.  How much of that?  Yeah, no kidding.  How much could I get for that?  Right.  What is that about?  Would you do one of the folds in her ankles?  Found some popcorn in there.  We should do an Obama search every day on YouTube because there's some just great stuff  coming up now, man.  Well, they're getting pretty dirty, both of them. 
[01:04:30]  They're just picking each other apart until one of them becomes the candidate.  Right.  And then they will be united and it'll be wonderful and everyone's great.  And then the real dirt that they're holding back is going to come out.  And then the Republican filth.  The Republicans are right now just sitting back.  I know.  Oh, this is cute.  Yeah.  They go, this is so cute.  Look at the little things they're pulling out.  Look at the laundry list we have on Obama.  Just wait.  Because I don't think you're going to find this kind of dirt on McCain.  I think he's just going to, in a debate, he's going to destroy either one of them after 
[01:05:00]  all this.  I don't think so.  I think you're going to find crap on McCain.  Obama could talk circles around McCain.  I'm not saying that what he's saying is anything of substance.  You know what?  But his public persona is going to kick McCain's ass.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, you've got the young, intelligent, slick-talking black guy against the old crusty  white, which I don't know when that became a sin, to be an old white guy with experience.  I'm so sick of this. 
[01:05:30]  I was like, oh, do we just want an old white guy in there?  I don't know.  Look around.  Yeah.  There's buildings and airplanes and stuff.  I mean, they did pretty good over the past.  Last time we checked, last time I checked, we're still the only superpower left, and we  did it with no women or black candidates, okay?  It was all old white guys.  I hope he does win and runs the country into the ground like their neighborhoods.  Okay?  And you know what?  I don't think he's...  I'm just teasing.  He's a very articulate, nice-smelling fella.  Boarded up White House, you know? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, come on, Rich.  Don't help me.  I've already dug myself a hole.  No, because I don't consider him really black.  Like, Omar...  No, he's whiter than you and I, for crying out loud.  He doesn't need that Popeye's.  He eats at Boston Market.  He's not a Popeye's guy.  Wait.  If Omar ran for president, that's who I would vote for.  Oh, from the wire?  A man with a scar on his face.  Who?  What's that?  Omar who?  From the wire.  No, Omar from the wire.  Look him up.  That's the kind of guy you want to vote.  Wait, get a picture of Omar.  Omar, because I think this picture will scare the hell out of, certainly, Anthony, and 
[01:06:30]  certainly Nick.  I've seen him.  I wanted, like, an Idi Amin black guy.  I didn't even vote for a guy like that.  Patrice?  Imagine that.  This is Omar.  Patrice.  Look, Nick, really fast.  Now, if that was your candidate, bro.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  See, now, I'd vote for that.  That's change.  Yeah.  That's real change.  That's real change.  And he'd work for that, too.  Omar is a lot darker than Obama.  But that's real change.  He's got a scar completely down the front of his face.  Now, Obama's mother is white, and his father is African. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's not really, like, African-American.  That's because that's where his family was placed, like, a couple hundred.  You know what I mean?  Oh, here we go.  Kansas City?  All right.  You want to go, Jimmy the Greek, Voss?  Go ahead.  Let her rip.  Thank you.  I'm glad you said Voss.  That has nothing to do with me.  See, this is why we can't pay you guys, because when you say something like that, they can  just say, you just don't have him on the show anymore, and you guys are safe.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  That's cool.  Thank you.  Am I getting lumped into this?  Did I just get lumped into his silly crap?  Wait, wait.  I'm not being a ranger.  I did it for six months without getting in trouble.  Give me some credit, will you?  All right.  Listen, we got to take a break.  Oh.  Speaking of the...  The cops are here.  Speaking of these two taking shots at each other, we did the whole Hillary Clinton-Bosnia  sniper fire thing yesterday.  Remember that?  Remember?  Do you remember?  Basically, Hillary saying that she landed, what, in Bosnia, and there was sniper fire. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, under sniper fire.  She was rushed to the cars and then rushed to a base because the bullets are flying.  Yeah, big story.  Everyone knows a big story.  Well, we took that lie.  It turned out to be a lie, and we had a little fun with it.  Hillary Clinton is running for president.  Hillary!  Hillary!  Hillary Clinton has a spotty memory.  I certainly do remember that trip to Bosnia.  These events never happened.  And I remember landing under sniper fire. 
[01:08:30]  Alzheimer's is a devastating illness that affects millions of people worldwide.  Okay, listen up.  Did anybody see a sniper?  Did anybody see anything?  Anybody see a sniper?  Including Hillary Clinton.  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport.  Murph will receive an enemy sniper fire.  Eight ball is down.  But instead, we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicle. 
[01:09:00]  Give generously to the Hillary Clinton Alzheimer's Foundation.  It was a moment of great pride for me.  This promotional message is complete bull.  Oh, boy.  I don't have to hear me today.  Rich, bring us back.  I guess.  Wow.  Oh, good.  Rich gets to do.  Hope you're in the Anthony's show.  Nick DiPaolo in the studio.  Rich Voss.  Nick, you can go to his...  Whatever that plug is, it's... 
[01:09:30]  What is it?  It's NickDip.com.  D-I-P.  NickDip.com.  One word, plug.  Rich Voss, Poughkeepsie this weekend.  And this is the main show you want to come see Voss in Arlington, Virginia.  I forget the name of the place I'm at in Arlington, but it's in April.  And it's like some kind of bear.  You know, I'll think of it.  You know what it is.  It's called The Red Roof Inn.  No, it's... 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  And Nick will be doing his TV show from the room next to me.  He travels with it.  It's called TheRedRoof.com.  NickDip.  Wow, Rich.  I could actually do it.  I could bring my laptop with you.  Just do it from there.  Just waiting for Jim Morrison to kick in here.  Nah, he doesn't come in.  What is he going to start singing?  One of my favorite Doors songs right here.  Come on.  No?  People just come in and go, what a train wreck Voss is. 
[01:10:30]  I heard he used to smoke marijuana.  You know how drugged out they were?  They weren't invited to Woodstock.  The Doors, they said, you know what?  I don't think we can have you guys at Woodstock.  Too many drugs?  They had Hendrix and Joplin, but how bad a drug...  Yeah, but they also had Sha-na-na.  That's right.  They picked some weird bands for that dumb thing.  That dumb thing was the biggest concert in history.  Yeah, I know.  I understand that.  But a few of them...  Look at the lineup for Woodstock.  There were a lot of dumb bands in there.  Yeah.  He did have The Doors hanging around already. 
[01:11:00]  Why not The Doors?  Sha-na-na.  Besides The Who...  I left early when The Monkeys came on.  That Richie...  Richie Havens guy.  Richie Havens.  Gives a crap.  You want to sit and watch that?  You know how many crap...  You know how much crap...  No, everyone watched the Woodstock movie.  Yeah.  Because everyone says they were at Woodstock and wasn't really.  So they watched the Woodstock movie and it looks like, oh wow, that must have been great.  How much crappy bands must have been...  I mean, just all the... 
[01:11:30]  All right.  I want to see The Who.  No, wait, wait.  Go up.  This is the actual lineup of Woodstock.  We weren't going to go here, but that's fine.  This is the beauty of this show.  It was Richie Havens who gives a crap.  Freedom!  Ugh.  Well, and he also just did Beatles songs.  Then you had Swami Satchidanada.  See?  You're going to sit through Swami a Swami?  I like his old stuff.  Swami Satchidanada.  Say, Swami, you got to fluence these dice.  Oh, Bugs Bunny reference. 
[01:12:00]  Very nice.  I love that.  I actually got that one.  Swami!  Some of the cartoon ones I don't get from you, but I got that one.  Love that.  Country Joe McDonald.  Country Joe and the Fish.  Well, no.  I don't think the fish were available.  I think it was just Country Joe.  It was just Country Joe?  Who the hell is Country Joe?  Country Joe.  He wound up doing that song about Vietnam.  He had that good song.  One, two, three, what are we fighting for?  Don't give a damn.  Next stop is Vietnam.  Hippie.  Yeah.  Another filthy hippie is what he was.  Then you had John B. Sebastian.  John Sebastian? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  From Love and Spoonful, I think.  Right.  Right?  Yes.  Sweetwater, who never made it.  No.  Incredible String Band.  What?  Who?  They never made it.  You had Burt Sommer.  You're sitting through Burt Sommer?  This is like Last Comic Standing.  Yeah, there's a lineup for Last Comic Standing.  Oh, that's very good.  He's just getting you back from that Red Room.  No, I didn't even...  I like what's...  I like...  That was just a reference.  I like what's going on now.  Nick's feeling very comfortable.  You better bring out your A game. 
[01:13:00]  You're going to make fun of Nick.  He's coming back strong.  Nick is...  Believe me, I just grabbed the reference.  I forgot Rick was even the star that time.  So did everyone else.  Apparently.  Let's go back to the Burt.  Oh, right.  Burt Sommer.  Then you had Tim Harden.  Who?  Then you had...  What the hell are these guys?  The doorman?  This is what you're sitting watching.  You're right.  In a bunch of mud with stinking hippies.  But everyone remembers it as the greatest thing ever, man.  Oh, it was great. 
[01:13:30]  The Who played.  Yeah.  Shut up.  I mean, shut up to the people that say that.  Of course.  Ravi or Ravi Shanker.  Ravi Shanker.  Horror.  What the hell is that?  Then you had Melanie.  Melanie?  Wasn't she...  Didn't she do...  I got a brand new pair of roller skates.  Oh, is that Melanie?  You put them on the top of the stairs.  Here's the best part of Melanie.  That's her hit.  Most people, that just went over their heads, which is fine.  She actually did two songs.  Beautiful People and Birthday of the Sun.  Oh, Birthday of the Sun. 
[01:14:00]  She did a Marilyn Manson cover?  What?  Oh, no.  She wasn't doing the Beautiful People.  Oh, I got a little confused.  I don't think that one.  I thought there was a time machine involved.  What stuck?  Arlo Guthrie did his dumb crap.  Arlo Guthrie.  At least that's a name people know.  And Joan Baez finished out.  Joan Baez, who is just...  Couldn't find an ounce of douche at that show.  She gets up on stage and starts babbling about her boyfriend or husband or something. 
[01:14:30]  And he's in prison on a hunger strike.  Who was her boyfriend?  Ruben King Carter?  Probably.  But wait a second.  That was in nighttime shows, too?  That was all of day one?  All of day one.  That's day one.  That was my argument.  Two more crappy days to go.  All right.  Day two.  Here you go.  Day two.  By the time Hendricks played, no one was there.  He was playing a bunch of blowing around garbage and a few passed out hippies.  So day one, everyone was stuck on the thruway, obviously.  They didn't get a trap. 
[01:15:00]  They were trying to find a parking space.  Day two, you got Quill.  Well, exactly.  Exactly.  We're the eighth largest city in the country, man.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Get a job.  Jose Feliciano, was he day two?  He was there, right?  Was he there?  I think so.  What were they not supposed to do?  The brown acid or whatever?  Don't take the brown acid.  Stay off the towers.  They should have taken the brown acid.  Yeah, take the brown acid.  This lineup would have looked a lot better if they took the brown acid.  Keith Hartley band. 
[01:15:30]  Then you had Santana.  All right.  That Santana came out.  Can't make fun of Santana.  No, you can, because if you've seen that, it's nothing but a two-hour-long, stupid Santana  guitar lead.  Well, a couple of bongos in there, too, though.  Yeah, of course.  Bongos.  Got to give it up for the bongos.  Oh, enough.  And then you had Canned Heat.  Canned Heat.  That was a good bit.  Showing off the contract.  Yeah.  Great. 
[01:16:00]  See, now it's pretty good, though, Santana.  And then you got the Grateful Dead, but they only did four songs.  But their four songs probably lasted eight hours.  Yeah, that's all right.  The first concert I ever went to was the Grateful Dead.  They played for five hours.  Enough already.  All right.  I don't like it.  Then Mountain got a big set list.  Thirteen songs.  Wow.  Thirteen songs.  What was their big one up?  Mountain.  Ooh.  They did Mississippi Queen.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  You're right.  Mississippi Queen.  They played that 13 times is what they did. 
[01:16:30]  They played a 13-song set.  No Mississippi Queen.  Oh, my God.  They must have came up with that song afterwards.  Did they do Nantucket's Sleigh Ride?  Not that either there, Anthony.  That was their only other hit.  I don't recognize any of these songs from Mountain.  What band?  And then you had, what?  What band after Mountain they broke up did they go to?  Small Hill.  Oh, I was cursing.  Sorry.  I almost had the F word.  I was like, what the F is?  Is there a trivia contest? 
[01:17:00]  You would know because you're a...  Why would I know Mountain?  I'm not even a Mountain fan.  After Mountain, Rotgut hit the stage.  Rotgut was up there.  I forgot.  I played Woodstock.  That's a great name for a man.  It's Anthony's old band.  Old band.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Then you had CCR.  Uh-huh.  Very good.  Can't complain about that.  That's at least...  Sly and the Family Stone.  Okay.  Now we're rocking a little bit.  They probably didn't even have their biggest hits, though, at that point.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're like, all these guys kind of in the 70s really took off. 
[01:17:30]  Then you got Jazz Joplin, and then you got The Who.  Okay.  All right.  That was a big night, night two.  It was a big one.  Well, then, day three.  Now our bit is losing steam, because you got a pretty good lineup here.  Jose Feliciano.  You got Jefferson Airplane.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got Joe Cocker.  Wow.  Doing his palsy thing.  They had a point.  Country Joe and the Fish.  I'll see Country Joe and the Fish now.  Yeah.  Set change.  I guess Fish finally arrived.  Yeah, the Fish showed up. 
[01:18:00]  Ten Years After.  That was the chicks that sing back up with them.  Ten Years After.  Yeah.  They did that song, but I don't see it on the list.  Ten Years After.  Eight Miles High.  No.  I have no idea.  That was the birds.  The band.  They were great.  The band.  And then After Midnight.  It really kicked in.  These bands hit the stage.  Blood, Sweat, and Tears.  Oh.  Love them.  The grandma that Voss made out with.  Really?  White Albino was it? 
[01:18:30]  Johnny Winter.  I just got excited when I saw Johnny Winter's name.  I know you did.  And the first song he did, Mama, Talk to Your Daughter.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  Send her off with Opie.  Cut the irony.  Then you got Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  Wow.  Okay.  They did 16 songs, starting after Midnight, after Johnny Winter and the other bands got  off.  And then Paul Butterfield, Blues Band.  Yuck.  Oh, all right.  Sha-na-na. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God.  They performed basically at, like, four in the morning.  Who gives a crap?  And then finally, Jimi Hendrix, when everyone was trying to find their cars.  Yeah.  What's canceled acts?  Are these ones that...  Yeah, these were all the acts that said no.  The Jeff Beck Group, Iron Butterfly.  What was Iron Butterfly doing?  Some type of brown assy.  Stuck at the airport.  They were stuck at the airport.  I thought there was another band.  No.  Hey, I love it.  Stuck at the airport.  Stuck at the airport.  It's a great band.  Oh, this is really interesting.  I've never seen this before. 
[01:19:30]  Cancelled acts.  So you had Iron Butterfly.  The reason they were canceled, they were stuck at an airport.  Their manager demanded helicopters and special arrangements just for them.  Were wired back and told as impolitely as the Western Union would allow to get lost.  But in other words, you know, they told me, F off.  Joni Mitchell was supposed to be there, but she was on the Dick Cavett show instead.  Now, that memorable moment.  Just like with Stuck.  A band called Lighthouse.  Well, there's a current, well, not a current band. 
[01:20:00]  A band from a few years ago that decided to call themselves Lighthouse as well.  Feared that it would be a bad scene, man.  So they canceled.  Like Altamont Speedway.  Someone's going to die.  And then a band called Ethan Brown or maybe a solo artist.  I don't know.  He was arrested for LSD three days.  You might want to get rid of that box.  This is not a good time to be there.  Of course he was.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Stupid Steve is IMing in the middle of this.  Thanks, Steve.  Arrested for LSD three days before the event.  And then decline invitations. 
[01:20:30]  These guys had an invite and just said, F you.  The Beatles, Zeppelin.  Oh, the door said, F you.  Okay.  Bob Dylan said, F you.  Turned it down because of his disgust of the hippies hanging around his house.  Wow.  Really?  Dylan?  Wow.  Flaming liberal?  What a douche.  What the hell?  The Beatles said no because Lennon said he couldn't get them together.  Zeppelin said no.  Got a higher paying gig elsewhere.  The door said no because Morrison hated large outdoor venues. 
[01:21:00]  The birds said no.  Tommy James and the Shondell said no.  The Shondell said no because they were at Bananas and Poughkeepsie.  Jethro Tull said no.  Ready for this one?  Turn it down because they thought it wouldn't be a big deal.  Yeah.  Way to go.  Way to go, Ian Anderson and your stupid flute.  So managers were screwing people up all the way back to the 60s.  Oh, yeah.  Honestly, God.  You don't want to say yes.  No, we got a club in Ohio.  Bad gig. 
[01:21:30]  Exactly.  Oh.  You want to open for canned heat?  That'll just hurt your reputation.  Really?  I said there was another band called Lighthouse.  No, that was Lifehouse.  Thank God I didn't know that.  Lifehouse.  I don't listen to Lifehouse.  Lifehouse.  I didn't get hit by the sword of the gay.  And then you had a band called Mind Garage.  They declined because they thought it wouldn't be a big deal and had a higher paying gig elsewhere.  Yeah.  Well, a little...  Why did we go there?  I don't know, but I enjoyed it.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  I don't know how we ever get on those little tangents, but man, what the hell? 
[01:22:00]  It's like a Bill Puzzle.  I hosted Woodstock 99.  I don't think you know that.  I know that because you've never failed to mention it.  Oh, that's right, Rich.  It was 100,000 people.  It was so cool.  It was great.  And look where it led you.  It led me to other places.  To the Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh.  Oh.  I know.  Shouldn't you be like a huge sitcom star by now?  I think I got a shot.  I think I did a call into Pereno from a witch star.  Did you?  Oh, did you? 
[01:22:30]  What was he doing?  I don't want to be in studio.  What was he doing?  Spooning this eight-year-old.  Hi, Rich.  Nick knows.  Hey, believe me.  The guy, I met him, you know, when I started comedy.  I got a slower one now.  A good guy.  Pereno is a good guy.  I'm sure.  We buried the hatchet with him years ago.  Oh, did you?  Buried a few other things.  Well, no, no.  I believe he attempted to bury other things.  And we weren't listening.  But he used to do Afternoons at BCN.  Yes.  And I kicked his ass back in the day. 
[01:23:00]  At AAF?  At AAF.  Yes.  I used to listen to you guys.  Really?  Oh, I loved AAF.  Oh, we, yeah.  It was Van Halen every other song.  Yeah, pretty much it was.  I loved it.  Guess what?  They're still doing the same thing 10 years later.  Yeah.  And, well, Pereno used to, like, hit on his interns and stuff.  Yeah.  The male ones, right?  It's well done.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  The boys.  And he just did a stint.  Yes, he did.  He got out of prison recently.  Did he get out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did a little stint.  There were some allegations that were made. 
[01:23:30]  When he was working for XM, by the way.  Working for XM of him, maybe going around with some PlayStations to youth centers.  Yeah.  Really?  And getting young boys to come over his house and play a little PlayStations.  He had one, like, allegedly had one chained to a radiator, I remember, for about a year  and a half.  That was the Romer.  I don't know.  And it was in D.C.  He liked little ethnic boys.  Yes.  Apparently.  In prison, like, now, when one was done before the next one, did he say commercial break  or something? 
[01:24:00]  Or now we get a live read?  Nothing on that one.  No, that one.  That's the first bad one today.  Not bad, Rich.  That's not bad.  It was almost 8 o'clock.  You're doing good.  It's the first bad one.  You really are.  That was horrible.  But I did bring up Perennial to give you the story.  I did lead you into it.  Okay.  So maybe I was...  You get an assist.  I get an assist, and then I got picked off trying to steal the base.  An assist on his kidney.  Going back to this.  Very nice.  Going back to the Hendrix thing and Woodstock, I didn't know any of these facts until today, 
[01:24:30]  but Hendrix insisted on being the final performer, and he was scheduled to perform Sunday night  at midnight.  Oh, really?  Not a bad slot for this festival, right?  Because all those other bands were taking their sweet old time.  He didn't take the stage until 9 in the morning, nine hours after he was supposed to hit the  stage.  And no one was there.  That's because she came late.  And he played two hours to a dwindling audience.  All right.  Hey, before we take another break, we got one of the stories of the day.  It's kind of a slow news day today, I think. 
[01:25:00]  Although they're talking about young kids getting into ultimate fighting.  I think that's a great idea.  Yeah, that's pretty funny to watch, to tell you the truth.  Little five-year-old kids just beating the crap out of each other.  I think most people don't understand that ultimate fighting has become a legit sport.  When it first, you know, hit our, uh, hit our, uh, I just got so distracted.  Sorry.  When we first started hearing about ultimate fighting, it was just a blood sport, right?  Yeah.  Oh, it was great.  You watch them just have elbows in the face. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, knuckle, bare knuckle.  Yeah.  Broken arms and stuff.  And then they kind of like adjusted the rules a little bit.  Ruined it.  It's a legitimate sport now.  Wrecked it.  I'd watch them just smash their noses.  It's brutal.  It started with a tough man.  Remember the tough man competition?  Yeah, tough man competition.  It was a round-robin tournament.  You had to fight five fights in one night to win it.  Yeah, yeah.  And I saw that guy, Don Frye.  He's like, uh, already people don't even know who he is anymore, but he's like a handsome  fireman from like Arizona.  He was like six foot, 205. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And he was, he won the whole thing that night.  He beat, the last two guys were like six foot eight.  One guy was a black guy who still don't, he's like a champion.  He had like a ninth degree black belt.  Don Frye just beat this guy.  I go, this is the type of guy you spill a beer on.  And you're like, yeah, what up, man?  But talk about a tough, oh my God, he's a real badass.  They did put a bunch of rules to it and stuff, because it used to just be brutal.  Yeah.  I liked watching it.  I can't decide if I like it or not. 
[01:26:30]  Ultimate fighting?  I put it on a lot of times as, you know, two guys in a missionary position for a half hour.  You're on the right channel?  You know what I mean?  They have to get up, though.  Now, even they changed that rule, right?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They make him get up after a while?  Yeah.  At least I should call Rogan.  He knows.  I would get bored.  Yeah.  They would get tied up forever.  And you're just waiting there.  Yeah.  Submission holds.  It's like being at a gay beach and watching you guys on a towel.  You want to tell us why you know that, Nick? 
[01:27:00]  You want to share today?  I'm from the Massachusetts area.  I had a small home in Provincetown for a couple summers.  Share the room with Durrell.  All right.  Linger two hours ago.  Why can't these kids have ultimate fight?  Kids take karate class.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a little different.  Well, who says they can't?  Go to another level.  Because someone's going to complain and it's going to ruin it.  Well, yeah.  A soccer mom with a...  What's great is the videos they're showing of kids under the age of 10 just beating the 
[01:27:30]  crap out of each other.  It's very fun to watch.  Yeah, because that's what the news does.  Kids fighting is just fun to watch.  Why do the research and tell people that this is a legitimate sport now and there's a lot  of safety of bars in place, whatever?  No, just show two 10-year-olds kicking the crap out of them.  It's probably one of the best things to watch on YouTube is just kids getting hurt.  And kids beating each other up.  Knocking each other out.  I love it.  They always have a couple of 12-year-old kids barking in their bedroom.  Yeah.  And one kid just laying another kid out. 
[01:28:00]  It really is.  Clocks them in the head.  They all start laughing.  Yes.  Kids out like a light and they're all giggling.  You might have a broken neck.  You could be paralyzed.  They're high-fiving each other.  That's great.  Do you watch the ones on the video where they have fish fights up in the desert and stuff?  What's that?  What is that?  Fight clubs?  Yeah, fight clubs.  They just completely beat the crap out of each other.  They do it in the parking lot.  Last time I played Governors, I go out for a cigarette break in between shows. 
[01:28:30]  And it's like, this was about a year ago.  It's like 10, 15 white kids with their shirts off in a circle with one kid in the middle.  And they're wailing on each other.  It's a long island.  On a Friday night.  It's beautiful.  I guess you had a bad night, huh?  I'm trying to hand them flyers to the show.  Come on, kid.  You're supposed to make them laugh and have them leave the club feeling, oh, wow, my life.  I'm feeling good about my life now.  They're beating the crap out of each other in between Nick DiPaolo shows.  That's the thing. 
[01:29:00]  That was even more depressing.  They were my demographic.  They were kids that would have known me.  And they weren't even coming to the show.  They were fighting on the parking lot.  They were just using the parking lot for their fight club.  We're all standing out there.  Even the owner, Jimmy, we're laughing.  They're in a circle wailing on each other.  I'm like, what is going on in this world?  Fights are great to watch.  Yeah.  It just are street fights.  Yeah.  I love watching them.  I'd rather see them doing that than skateboarding on a Friday night.  Yeah, yeah.  Just beat each other up.  The hell.  We're a violent country.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, a woman forced to remove nipple ring at airport. 
[01:29:30]  Big story today.  Big story today.  Obviously, another slow news day, huh?  It was White Plains Airport.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big story in White Plains.  And then you got a man claiming he was molested by Bigfoot.  Big news day today.  Come on.  Big news day.  It's not true.  Wait a minute.  Can I just make a bet?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Danny found that story.  Of course he did.  What?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Of course he did.  He finds some good stuff.  Where do you find that stuff?  We don't want to give away our secrets. 
[01:30:00]  But we got a story about a man claiming he was molested by Bigfoot.  What?  What?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Nick DiPaolo in studio.  NickDip.com.  Rich Voss in studio.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie tonight and tomorrow night.  And Anthony was admiring what the radio station here in New York is doing after we get off the air.  Is that what I was doing?  Oh boy were you admiring it. 
[01:30:30]  What's going on?  What are they doing after the show?  Well I was commenting on March Madness.  Yeah.  And I don't understand why it's so mad.  And apparently I was told there's so many games and so many college basketball teams.  It's just madness.  It's crazy.  So I looked and I thought what I saw was a March Madness bracket.  Well you know you got all the teams and it narrows down to just the two that are going  head to head after all of them move on. 
[01:31:00]  Can I stop you for a second?  This is where we see if the new PD has a sense of humor.  Yes.  All right.  Exactly.  And then it says March Bracket Brawl.  And I thought perhaps that there was a problem with saying March Madness like there is with Super Bowl and things like that.  And they had to call it something else.  Until, Opie, I looked a little closer at the brackets and didn't see college basketball teams.  What I saw were rock bands. 
[01:31:30]  And what they are doing, I guess, March Bracket Brawl is putting bands, they're pitting bands against each other.  And I believe they are now down to the Elite Eight.  I have canned heat and country Joe in the finals.  Oh, you're out.  And they've started off with, wow, how many?  64?  Is that what they start off with, March Madness? 
[01:32:00]  They're following the NCAA rules.  They certainly are ripping it off.  I mean following those rules.  And I'm looking at some of the bands.  Led Zeppelin against Judas Priest.  Who do you think won that one?  I would have to say Judas Priest.  Of course Zeppelin.  It was Zeppelin.  Zeppelin's taken it all the way down.  They better go all the way.  They've defeated, after Judas Priest, they defeated the Who.  Wiped out Captain Tennille on the Elite Eight.  Pink Floyd, who took Aerosmith, got wiped out by Led Zeppelin.  Oh, boy. 
[01:32:30]  And now I'm looking at Metallica just killing the cult, Def Leppard, Ozzy Osbourne, who beat out Bon Jovi, by the way.  Should they go by what band has more members alive right now?  Okay, the Who has a half a member.  Who's looking at kiddie porn.  And how do you go Nirvana against the Foo Fighters like that when they share Dave Grohl?  See, I wouldn't even show up for that game.  No, no. 
[01:33:00]  That's insanity.  Now that's madness.  That is crazy.  If you ask me, Nirvana against Pearl Jam, it's a battle of the 90s right there.  They're head-to-head now.  They're going for the next bracket, trying to get into that final four position.  See, I'm 46 years old.  Everybody on the left side of the chart are my favorites.  I can't stand any of this crap on the right.  You don't like the people on the right, which is the exact opposite of your political views, which is interesting.  I think Tool running away with it, beating out Coldplay and Green Day, Linkin Park. 
[01:33:30]  Tool and the Foo Fighters are going to square off on the March bracket brawl, Opie.  Wait, wait, wait.  Tool and the Foo Fighters?  That should be a...  When I saw that and realized what it was, I seriously asked if the window opened here on the 14th floor  because I want to throw that thing out the window.  It's like Albany versus Syracuse.  I was in the gym yesterday, and I hear this thing going on. 
[01:34:00]  I go, what horrible radio station would this be?  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know how to keep it.  He doesn't know how to keep it between the lines.  And I'm with Rich.  Trust me.  Between the brackets.  What were you doing in the gym?  Oiling the machines?  Yes, no.  No, oiling the man in the locker room.  We're going to go play golf this weekend.  Hey, how does Cinderella do?  Cinderella on that list there?  I don't...  Who were some of the bands that got knocked out in the first round?  First round knockout. 
[01:34:30]  REM got knocked out by Bon Jovi in the first round.  Twisted Sister lost to U2.  I mean, stop it.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  Why are you putting that against me?  That was a nail-biter, huh?  Yeah.  Who saw that coming?  Tom Petty lost to Pink Floyd.  Wait, how many points did they give Twisted Sister?  I don't know.  Probably not.  No.  Tenacious D beat Metallica?  What?  No.  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, look at Metallica going all the way.  Now, with the final...  Here's our Elite Eight.  Zeppelin, Hendrix, they're going to square off. 
[01:35:00]  Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Foo Fighters and Tool.  Wait a minute.  There's no Stones in there?  What happened to...  Oh, they lost in the first round?  Oh, they lost.  No, they beat Van Halen.  And they lost to Hendrix.  Okay.  They lost to Hendrix.  They beat the Ramones.  The Stones lost to Hendrix.  They beat the Ramones, Van Halen...  Wait a minute.  Did Mick Jagger pull a hammy or something?  How do you lose to Hendrix?  He's day-to-day with a heroin infection.  He pulled David Bowie's hammy. 
[01:35:30]  What happened?  That old gag.  What could it make it?  They're pumping his stomach.  Why does Hendrix beat out the Stones?  I don't know.  You know, there's no rhyme or reason to it.  That's why it's madness, but it doesn't say it, because they'd be sued.  Is this like the call is vote?  How does this work?  Yeah, how does it vote?  Who gets to choose?  How does this work?  They play the songs and somebody votes?  Who gets to choose, Tim?  Why is Arnold Schmancia in this?  What?  They play like three songs from each band. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  They're playing it.  You either...  Anyway.  We got Mike Birbigli in studio, joining the madness that is ensuing in studio.  This is a morning madhouse.  Oh, boy, is it.  We invited Mike back.  He was on our show about a month ago.  How you doing?  What's going on, man?  And you're doing the Caroline's thing this weekend, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm doing guest sets on Rich's show at Bananas.  Really?  I'm commuting up to Poughkeepsie.  Oh, for one. 
[01:36:30]  I just wanted...  Oh, wow.  I just wanted to go...  I liked it.  I liked it, too.  I liked Birbigli.  It wasn't bad.  No, Mike's doing something different, though.  Friday...  Yeah, he's making money.  Compared to me and Voss selling crack to kids up in Westchester.  Yeah, but at least we do it.  Oh, forget it.  Oh, good.  He completely lost confidence.  At least we...  Wow.  Not on it.  All right.  Birbigli moves on, and Voss.  Voss is knocked out. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, look at this.  Look at the bracket.  Bracket brawl.  This is comedy madness.  I remember when I...  Yeah, we're going to do comedy madness on our show.  We're going to fight all the guys in.  When I moved to New York City, Rich was so funny.  I remember that so well.  No, I...  Look at Rich.  He just looks...  Rich looks so dejected and disgusted.  No, it's just funny.  Birbigli is zinging him today.  Well, you know what?  This is going to build a self-esteem.  Go.  Keep going. 
[01:37:30]  No, he's...  I'm done.  He's getting shots.  He knows when to take the jump shot.  That was good.  He knows.  He sat at the table at the cellar.  Yeah, I know.  Listen.  What, are you practicing for Bob and Tom for next week?  Ooh.  What is that?  I don't know.  What do we have a...  We have a trader among us?  No, no, no.  Are you kidding me?  We don't...  We sell out anywhere.  Mike is doing...  I want to get the plug in.  Tonight at Caroline's, he's doing a different show than tomorrow night at Caroline's, which  will be different from his Sunday show.  Yeah, we're doing...  Three different shows.  Three different nights.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  And the Sunday night one, people...  The first hundred people show up, get a free copy of my DVD, which isn't out yet,  called What I Should Have Said Was Nothing.  Wow.  So that's a good...  Good thinking.  That's a good feature, yeah.  See, that's marketing.  Yeah.  You know what?  I gave a Rich Voss key change.  I'm the Dane Cook of comedy.  It's like Ron Popeil, this guy.  You know what?  Just set it and forget it.  That is marketing. 
[01:38:30]  You think I should say that?  No, the DVD, I can't believe...  Yeah, why not, right?  No, they cost like nothing.  Yeah, you want people to have them.  That's a good thing to do.  That's smart.  Maybe I should make one.  He's smart.  The Dane Cook of comedy.  We're trying to come up with a name for this show, if they pick it up for Comedy Central,  and we're thinking naming it...  Call it Seinfeld.  No, we're thinking of naming it Seinfeld.  Just call it Seinfeld.  I'm serious.  Just spell it slightly different.  Put the I in front of the E's.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  You're going to get some peripheral viewers that, you know, they'll watch a little bit 
[01:39:00]  of it and go, where's Seinfeld?  Where's the wacky neighbor?  Yeah.  You guys have such a highly rated first ten minutes.  Okay.  Hey, is it true?  Toucher and Rich, we love these guys up there in Boston.  They're doing the worst comedian brackets.  Oh, wow.  That would be a funny bit.  Worst comedian brackets.  You get like, yeah, you get 16 of the worst and have them battle it out.  Like Hacks.  That's a great idea.  If they're doing that, that's a great idea.  Like Sinbad against Gallagher. 
[01:39:30]  Yakov.  Yakov Shmirnoff.  I would have to pick Yakov.  Probably one of the worst comics ever to just hack up a stage.  I'll tell you, though, I was in Springfield last week at the airport, and that's where  Branson is.  He's got his own house.  He has his own theater.  He doesn't even perform at the theater.  Really?  It's just his name.  Oh, is that right?  That's how rich he is.  The Yakov Shmirnoff Theater.  Wow.  What happens if Gallagher had to go against his brother? 
[01:40:00]  Because, you know.  I don't know.  Let me go home and mob it over for you.  In a mallet match.  All right, listen.  We're going to mallet match.  We're going to move on.  Beat each other.  That's what I'd like to see.  The thickest fight.  That's how they should just settle it, with those big mallets over each other's watermelon  heads.  It was a comic-wrong Gallagher.  It was Gallagher 2.  That went out, and he said, Gallagher 2, audience nothing.  Very funny.  Hey, we got a woman that was forced to remove a nipple ring at an airport, and it's becoming 
[01:40:30]  a big story.  What's her name?  Chelsea Clinton?  No, that lawyer lady that takes on all women.  Gloria Allred.  Yeah, she's on this one.  I hope she finds a lump in her armpit the size of a grapefruit tonight.  Oh, damn.  I don't like her either, Nick.  But I would...  Wow.  I didn't say malignant.  I mean, just a lump.  I think you might hate her a little more than me.  She might go away the next day.  She might be swollen or something.  Yeah, like a clogged paw from Roll-On. 
[01:41:00]  I'm not talking about cancer.  It could be anything.  Come on.  That was horrible.  I'm talking about things like that when Rich Voss is sitting here with pretty much a little  juice box on his kidney that has to be poked.  I know.  Shoot.  He's got a little juice box.  Get a little straw sticking out of his...  It's drawn there.  He's got an old sippy cup kidney.  When they take the liquid out, we're giving free Mike Babiglia DVDs away for the first  five doctors that show up. 
[01:41:30]  Rich, I'm only laughing because you're plugging my DVD.  Babiglia ain't playing.  No.  He knows how to play.  I just flew in.  I came from the airport, literally.  Really?  Yeah.  Where were you?  I was in Los Angeles.  We were shooting a pilot for CBS.  Yes.  Oh.  Which is why...  How's that going?  Which is why...  They're making me get skinnier.  Oh, really?  You know?  Because I'm...  What are you, Roseanne Barr?  You're funny.  No, I know. 
[01:42:00]  That's how I feel.  I mean, I don't have like a weight problem, but I'm like the guy who could put the brakes  on an orgy.  Yeah.  I'm going to be like, is he invited?  Why is he eating a stuffed crust pizza?  That is not hot.  But the...  No, but I do have issues with...  I mean, because I Google myself.  I'm sure you do that, right?  I Google you.  We got lotion handy.  I want my free DVD.  Last year, I was...  Someone wrote on their blog that I was pudgy and awkward.  Like, that's a bad thing for a leading man on a sitcom? 
[01:42:30]  That's all they have.  No.  Pockward.  They said I was pockward.  Oh, pockward.  And I wasn't feeling great about myself already.  Like, I've reached this point in my life where I don't look in the mirror anymore because  I get angry.  Like, I feel like I'm complaining about a bad call a ref just made.  I'm like, come on.  You're blind if you're leaving the house like that.  And the ref is God.  And the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline.  And it's a close game.  Because my gut is large and my hairline is fast. 
[01:43:00]  And I'm all riled up.  I'm about to charge the field.  And then the guy comes by with fried dough.  And I'm like, next time.  Folks, somebody's been writing too.  It's not on it.  Shut up.  That was a great bit, Mike.  That's a very good bit, Rich.  Stop.  Rich just hates something called writing.  Yeah.  You can't learn a thing or two for Mike.  It's something Rich is so unfamiliar with.  You're showing off your discipline.  Bandwagon jackos.  Okay.  If I came in and did that, you would throw me out the door. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  If I recited anything.  Yeah.  Because we'd say, you're not Rich Voss.  Get out of here.  He's an imposter.  Yeah.  What did you do to the real Rich Voss?  Let's go to Mark in Boston listening on BCN.  Mark, what's up?  Mark.  Yeah.  They think Jay Leno's going to take it all the way for the worst comedian.  Wait.  You got info on the Touching Rich thing?  Yeah.  They expect Jay Leno to take it the whole way.  Wow.  But that's been pretty successful. 
[01:44:00]  There's a discrepancy there because he, I think you were going to say the same thing.  He was supposedly an amazing comedian.  He's an ex.  I saw him, man, in the 80s.  I mean, all these young kids know him from the Tonight Show.  They're like, you're not funny.  You should have seen him in the 80s.  This guy could own a room.  And he could do hours.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, and crush with, you know.  He's funny on the Tonight Show.  No, I'm not going to.  Talk about how UFOs landed in the middle of the country and Bob Buki and his cousin Weenie  would find.  I remember some of the old.  Cliff Marks.  Coleno Bits writes that Touching Rich yesterday, they had Dave Coulier. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, there you go.  Beating out Margaret Cho and Robin Williams.  Oh, God.  Robin Williams beating out Jeff Foxworthy for the worst comedian.  Now they're on the right track.  Today, it's Jimmy Fallon versus Adam Sandler.  Now they're on the right track.  I got to give it.  Absolutely.  Once again, I got to give it to Touching Rich.  That's a great idea.  Make sure you tune them in today on BCN.  Do they have a catchy name for it?  I'd like to know what their little catchy name is.  See, that's thinking.  Everyone's doing this dumb band versus band thing across America. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  We're not the only station doing this here in New York.  And we've just been so lazy, we didn't even come up with anything.  Well, good point.  Good point.  We've been doing it.  We're looking at a board that was made up and drawn up.  Someone had to make that stupid thing.  You don't have to.  You have the worst comics live every day in here.  No need for a competition.  Playing out right before your eyes.  Good point.  We're courtside.  That's great.  And then when we run out of Spike Lee seats over here. 
[01:45:30]  And then when we run out of things to do, we just play audio clips of news stories.  Jesus Christ, we suck.  We should have a radio show bracket.  O&A win.  You got to be in the room next to him in his basement doing...  We should be the final bore.  Right.  I think we're taking on Mason and Kolinsky.  Do you want the nipple story or what?  Who doesn't? 
[01:46:00]  I did set it up.  It's a woman forced to remove nipple ring at airport there, Mike.  I want to include you here.  Nipple ring.  It's a big story.  Wow.  I don't have much to add.  Well, you might, though.  Listen to the audio.  This Texas woman says Transportation Security Administration agents put her through something  she wouldn't wish on anyone.  Mandy Hamlin says...  The metal officers at Lubbock Airport told her if she wanted to board her flight, she'd have  to remove her nipple ring. 
[01:46:30]  Her nipple ring.  She was at the airport.  It's a phony voice.  After she ate sushi.  Sushi.  Sushi.  She had to remove the nipple ring from the piercing.  She had sushi on it.  Sushi.  Sushi.  That guy annoyed me all night long.  I couldn't think of anything but sushi.  Mike, they do callbacks on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  We did some yesterday, and the guy said sushi. 
[01:47:00]  Really weird.  Some English guy who had the delivery that every English newsman has.  Where they have to talk like this.  And then she drowned in the Thames.  What is that whole thing at the end?  Liverpudlian.  Ugh.  I get annoyed with news where they treat every story with the same level of importance,  and they'll have the laser sounds.  It'll be like, pa-choo!  Are your kids having sex at the mall? 
[01:47:30]  I don't even have kids.  I'm like, are they?  I don't know.  I've got to get down to the mall.  The question is, can I watch from one of those benches?  I say sushi kind of weird.  Sushi.  No, this guy's got your beat, Rich.  He's like, yes.  Sushi.  I don't even remember the story, but it was sushi.  We don't have half our staff, because this dopey station here in New York figured, you  know, Opie and Anthony don't need their staff.  We'll send most of their staff down to WrestleMania for three days. 
[01:48:00]  Jimmy Norton's out doing gigs on the West Coast.  We lost E-Rock.  We lost E-Rock and Sam.  And other guys you don't know about.  But they're all down there in Florida for three days for WrestleMania.  The station in New York thought it was very important for them to fly out very early for  WrestleMania.  Vegas learning about the casino business.  But you picked up Boss.  You got DiPaolo.  You got Birbiglia.  I know.  We're set.  We're the same crew.  The place is dripping with talent. 
[01:48:30]  It's dripping with something.  I hear the banana with sunglasses is going to come by.  Dare to dream.  Do we have to play the whole clip just to get to sushi?  This is from yesterday.  I want to hear this idiot say sushi.  You're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste wasabi that's eaten with sushi.  You dumb limey.  It really is funny no matter how many times you hear it.  Eaten with sushi.  Wait, I've got to hear it again. 
[01:49:00]  Of course we do.  I'm so glad that it's early in the clip.  It's horse radish.  You're most likely to have come across it as the powerful paste wasabi.  That's eaten with sushi.  Sushi.  Powerful paste.  Powerful paste.  What a dink.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Powerful paste is their complexion.  English.  Let's go back to Boston.  We love Boston.  Big hello to everyone listening on BCN.  Rick, what's up?  Hi.  You're talking about the comic knockoff? 
[01:49:30]  I don't think they actually have a name for it.  No.  They already did the rock and roll one.  All right.  Oh, they did?  So they just decided to go with the comics?  That's a good idea.  And the comic wins like the...  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  It says on the phone here, more info on Toucher and Rich Comedian contest.  Remember the good old days?  How about the more info part?  Remember the good old days when people were nervous about calling the radio show? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, what happened?  Like, I better have something interesting to say.  Now they just call up.  Hey, how you doing?  You know that thing you talked about?  What?  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, so I figured I'd call.  I listened to that.  They don't even ask for gifts from this station either.  They just call.  They don't expect anything.  No, no prizes.  What do you have?  We have no prizes.  All right.  Back to nipple lady.  Told her if she wanted to board her flight, she'd have to remove her nipple rings. 
[01:50:30]  Pause.  Oh, he knew he had something good.  Her nipple rings.  Nipple rings.  Play that up.  12-minute dramatic pause.  Yeah.  Nipple rings.  Something she says she has never had to do in order to clear airport security.  It was just total humiliation.  Oh, shut up.  How is it humiliation?  You got a nipple ring.  How humiliated are you?  Come on.  Do you have to do it on the conveyor belt?  Lay on your back?  Dumb whore.  Take the metal out of you. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  I feel safer.  Just take your metal out of you.  Ouch.  Her piercing was at 38.  Which is a little odd.  How does a girl with a nipple ring get humiliated?  She got it at the mall a week ago with people watching in front of the Orange Julius.  Some guy with a rusty pair of pliers.  Her father stood next to her.  Yeah, exactly.  Humiliated.  Humiliated.  Oh, God.  Shut up.  She's on the nose.  It was just total humiliation. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah?  In front of people I have no earthly idea who they were.  You going to cry now, bitch?  Who did the piercing?  I felt like DiPaolo crossed the line there.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what it was in your tone, but it felt so real.  Oh, when he called her a whore?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was good.  That was a real emotion.  Well, I thought she's home would be this story.  It happened to me once.  I had to take my nipple ring out at Westchester.  And she was flying to do another dollhouse in Florida or something, you know?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:52:00]  She's on the dollhouse tour.  She's being humiliated at an airport.  Now, the 37-year-old woman is demanding an apology and a civil rights investigation.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  High-profile attorney Gloria Allred has taken up her cause.  The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary.  Ew.  The last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon.  The ring is stupid.  It's the ring.  First of all, yeah.  It's not the nipple. 
[01:52:30]  Pull it off like Oddjob and wing it and take someone's head off.  What are you going to do?  They didn't cut her nipple off.  It's not a third-world country.  They used to ring out.  It went off.  I mean, the TSA, they stripped me down last week.  They're the worst.  Did they?  It was unbelievable what they made me go through.  And I was yelling at them.  He goes, supervisor, you know.  Strip you down, really?  You don't yell at them.  What do you do?  You know, people don't understand certain things.  You're not going to win with the police and with airport security. 
[01:53:00]  You can't argue yourself and call them names, and they're going to go, all right, you're free to go.  It doesn't work.  Airport security, if you say things to them and start arguing, you go into the back room.  They'll put a glove on, and then they'll really, you know, inspect you.  Remember, didn't Kevin Meaney get arrested?  Yeah.  Kevin Meaney got arrested.  Yeah.  His kid ran away.  He was a kid, and he's a kid.  That's kind of weird.  That's why his kid ran away.  Now it's making sense. 
[01:53:30]  That's his whole story.  Forget about what I said.  But that, yeah, he told me right after it happened.  Yeah, yeah.  His kid ran away behind the security.  He went to chase his own kid, and they stopped him and, like, tackled him.  He said, oh, that's hilarious.  Well, he also, there was some threats of firearms and stuff.  He had talked about having a rifle, and they arrested him.  Took him in.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Ope, you were right.  Nick is very bitter.  It's fantastic.  Thank you.  From where?  Long Island? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, Steven S. is a regular.  They enjoy that down there.  Here's more of the nipple story.  Hamlin's ordeal all started when an officer waved a metal detector wand in front of Hamlin's  chest, and it went off.  I offered to show him, and no one would look at it.  I even offered to show the gentleman.  And the last guy that came over, and he was, you know, pretty much demanded me to take him  out.  Okay.  Now it's making more sense.  Okay, it's making more sense now.  She says, it goes off.  She was willing to show and say, look, I have a nipple ring. 
[01:54:30]  Dave said, no, we don't want to look.  Take it out and put it in the little thing, whatever, because they probably can't be looking  at girls' cans.  Right.  Well, that is a fine line between a nipple ring and pulling the pin on a grenade.  You don't know what that is.  There's a grenade in there.  A grenade instead of a breasted flag.  There's a nipple ring.  You better start running.  She could have been out-credited, this bitch.  You know, they did stuff with the shoe bomber guy, you know, came up with, maybe this is  the new thing. 
[01:55:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Grenades in the boobs.  Pull the pins.  Wait, so she was humiliated, but she was willing to show.  Exactly.  Shut up.  She's willing to show the.  Shut up.  The inspector, yeah, the nipple ring in her nipple.  I love butt.  But since they said no, just take it out.  Maybe because it was the first two weeks and with piercings, you got to keep them in so  that they stick.  I'm just speaking technically about piercings.  Yeah, Rich was thinking he was doing a joke there.  Maybe he was just giving us some knowledge. 
[01:55:30]  I was listening to him.  He was talking.  I was giving him the.  You're on the edge of your seat waiting for him to mess up.  No, I'm not.  You really are.  You're just, you're like one of those sucker fish with sharks just waiting for some little  tidbit to come your way.  There's got to be something wrong with what he's going to say.  There's got to be some flaw in logic.  Track four.  I was listening to him.  It was just how you were looking at him.  Maybe if you went to prison.  You're like, I think he's finally going to bomb.  This is going to be the one. 
[01:56:00]  You're supposed to look somebody in the eye.  This is going to be the one I could jump on.  You're supposed to look at me in the eye.  It's like Kevin Meany looking at a Cub Scout.  It's like, Kevin, you know I'm kidding out there.  We are the world.  Who's this black magic woman?  Don't run with that penis in your hand.  You'll knock your eye out.  We're going to lose the house.  That's dead on. 
[01:56:30]  Look, Kevin.  You're going to lose the house.  You're going to lose the goddamn house.  All I ask, he's just got to drop the we are the world bit.  That's the signature bit.  What are you kidding?  It's 2008.  Really?  He's still doing it?  I saw him a couple years ago.  He's still doing the we are the world bit.  He's got to stop.  He dropped a couple of the singers because they're dead.  Are you guys going to come to my show this weekend?  I know you probably say you will.  Well.  Where is that?  I'm going to tell the sleepwalking story that I was telling you guys last time.  I have to go to the show. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, I'm doing the sound.  You should come Saturday, though, to the sleepwalk show.  That's probably the most interesting one.  It's three nights at Caroline's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Three different shows with Mike Birbiglia.  I have a, I don't know if you know, Rich, I have like an actual sleepwalking issue.  Like I take pills for it and all this kind of stuff.  Yeah.  You jumped out of a window.  I literally, I jumped out of a window.  Second story window.  Landed on Eric Clapton's kid. 
[01:57:30]  This is what we're going to do.  Not funny.  Not funny.  I'm attempting to build what's called TSL.  So that's a fine tease.  We're going to have you retell the story after the break there, Mike.  Sounds good.  But first, we're going to get to the end of this nipple thing, too.  The end of the nipple story.  And he said that he couldn't look at them.  Hamlin says she was told to remove the jewelry.  But when she tried to do that, she had trouble taking one of the piercings out. 
[01:58:00]  During the news conference Thursday, Hamlin demonstrated how she had to use a pair of pliers to get one of the rings off.  As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing behind the curtain, she could hear a growing number of predominantly male TSA officers snickering in the background.  Snickering.  Allred says if her client doesn't get an apology, they may consider legal action.  TSA officials say they are reviewing the case to make sure the agency's policies were followed. 
[01:58:30]  I can't take it no more.  TNA officials?  I can't take it.  The TNA officials.  She's a whore with morals.  The guy doing the announcing is a phony with his fake pauses.  I can't take the world I'm living in no more.  Take them all and shoot them.  Gloria Allred and the dirty dyke lawyer.  There's no way off of this planet.  It really bugs me that I can't just leave.  Exactly.  If we could just get Nick to shoot all these people, then we could just have mostly Nick DiPaolo. 
[01:59:00]  It would be such a great world.  Mike, I've been defining you up to this point, but I didn't appreciate that type of suck.  I'm the only guy on your side in this room.  It's a respectful thing.  I'll take the leash off Voss and let him loose on you.  Hold on.  We've got to take a break.  We really do.  We could continue.  This show is terrific.  I love this.  I actually love this one today.  Voss at Bananas in Poughkeepsie tonight and tomorrow.  More with everybody after the break.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:30]  I loved your observation just now, Nick.  Nick DiPaolo in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You notice that Anthony likes to do a little of that multitasking.  What?  I'm typing away over there.  I text.  Text type.  He's like, I'm saying hi to my fans.  Like, do you have to do that to get popular?  Occasionally.  I'm even, I send out like a mass message in my MySpace.  You know?  Hey, quit bothering me.  That's my message. 
[02:00:00]  Like the personal touch.  You know.  Individual attention.  That's what we give people on.  What?  Yeah, that's what you're doing.  I was on.  Yeah.  On what pal is it?  Pal chat chat.  Pal talk.  Pal talk.  I was on Pal talk last night.  Uh-huh.  Why?  Because you wanted, you wanted what?  To be in touch with the fans?  Uh, yeah, a little bit.  That's what, uh, that's what pal talk is all about.  Yeah.  Actually, uh, we were having a gun show. 
[02:00:30]  There was a little gun show going on on pal talk last night.  A couple of the other people had guns.  Is that like PayPal?  Uh.  I confused the title.  It kind of cost me $45 to say hello to you.  Some girl.  South Africa.  No.  Yeah, it was fun.  Yeah.  So, you know.  The man loves the fans.  Nice community.  He wants to be in contact with them 24 hours a day.  That's that?  That's what he does.  Do you let them see you at home? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, why not?  I don't know.  It just, it seems weird that strangers are looking at you in your home with all your Nazi paraphernalia.  How else are they going to?  Nazi paraphernalia on display.  Of course he lets them.  What are you talking about, Vosha?  Your wife does it.  I don't.  She's got a webcam in the shower.  She just gave birth.  That's really nice.  Another one?  No.  Oh, Jesus.  She bounced back well, though.  They were like twins six months apart. 
[02:01:30]  She just pretty much gave up on you now?  Is that it?  It's her birthday.  I got to get her something.  Today?  Yes.  You forgot?  Who are you kidding?  It's already, you picked it out a week ago.  You're shaking in your shoes.  Come on.  No, I didn't get it.  I'll get her something at the outlets on the way to Poughkeepsie.  Get us.  My girlfriend and I were hanging out with Rich and Bonnie at, where was it, one of these  tapings?  I don't even remember.  And Rich looks at my girlfriend and goes, she's way out of your league.  And I look over at Bonnie, I'm like, what are you talking about? 
[02:02:00]  What leg do you have to stand on?  And Vos goes, yeah, she's damaged goods.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, you are a bastard.  I love that.  That's a good line.  She's damaged goods.  I got to the Vs.  Here's the thing.  Also, she's Canadian, so she's got to stick around.  She's got to stay in this marriage for a while.  I got a resume of the girls I've been with.  I mean, some of them pictures of it.  Some of the hottest girls that I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  I mean, they're all, they cry during sex, or they, you know, they're doing it with  you.  Or they were cutters.  I'm banging a strong middle.  Co-middle, okay?  I'm a co-middle.  All right?  To get people on my show, I'm giving free Mike Bibigley a DVD display.  I bought them from him.  Would that be the what I should have said was nothing DVD, right?  Did I get that right?  That's the one, yeah.  Okay.  Catchy.  Hey, let's do a little Bigfoot news.  No, this is the guy that said he was sexually assaulted by Bigfoot. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  We could have either done this story, or the man charged with having sex with picnic table.  Excuse me.  Is that really a story today?  Yeah.  God, we should have, we've got to save that one for Bob Kelly.  Because he has sex with the sinks.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  Picnic table.  I hope it was Naughty Pine.  57-year-old Gene Morrill will serve...  Same guy.  You got a new source. 
[02:03:30]  Is this the same guy from the last story?  It is possible.  I'm not quite sure.  Possible.  Not probable.  Why does he insist on, you know, staying in the news voice persona with these wacky stories?  57-year-old Gene Morrill will serve 20 years in prison for molestation charges.  He pleaded guilty in a Virginia court.  Does everyone have to sound like Rush Limbaugh?  You hear the Rush Limbaugh on that?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:04:00]  Excellence in broadcasting.  Bigfoot.  57-year-old Gene Morrill will serve 20 years in prison for molestation charges.  He pleaded guilty in a Virginia court for his attempts to solicit 13-year-old boys over the Internet.  But Morrill is making molestation charges of his own.  He reportedly is telling an investigator that he had been sexually assaulted by the legendary Bigfoot in New Hampshire.  Here, the creature is...  Wait, in New Hampshire?  New Hampshire.  What was Shaq doing in New Hampshire? 
[02:04:30]  Exactly.  What a sting.  Patrick Ewing banged him in New Hampshire.  He was touched by Big Pappy at a rest area in Durham.  New Hampshire?  I believe...  There's no Bigfoots in New Hampshire.  Bigfoots in the Pacific Northwest, right?  I've been all around New Hampshire.  He takes JetBlue now.  You haven't heard?  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, he's got a summer home on Lake Winnipesaukee.  Why is this news guy calling this dope out?  There's no Bigfoots in New Hampshire.  Just a Greek chick that I dated. 
[02:05:00]  In New Hampshire, here, the creature is supposedly caught on film over the years.  The Bigfoot claim brought some Snickers.  Are you serious?  I think he's an idiot.  I take him very seriously because I know that Mr. Morrill has issues.  The Fredericksburg Freelance Star newspaper reports Morrill's mental health became an issue that his defense used to seek leniency from the judge.  I've had a few that claimed abuse but never by a mythical creature.  This is Stafford County undercover detective Daryl Wells, who built the case against Morrill. 
[02:05:30]  He is a sexual predator that targets children.  But there was no leniency from the judge.  He declared Morrill competent to stand trial, then sentenced him to 20 years.  He says, who's your Bigfoot?  I was touched by the Loch Ness Monster.  Why would you say it was Bigfoot?  Well, because everybody that does that does look at the person's feet to see if it's going to be worthwhile.  Yeah.  Or the hands.  That's why no one ever approaches me. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, big feet, big hands.  Oh, okay.  It's quite a leap.  Then you assume if Bigfoot molested you, you really got molested.  Yeah, well, that's just...  That story kind of just stands on its own, doesn't it?  Yeah, there's really nothing there.  What do you want from us?  15 minutes on this?  Yeah, come on.  The story itself is good enough.  I was molested by Bigfoot.  Right.  Luckily.  Yeah.  And scene.  Scene.  And cut.  Oh, what's the matter?  Voss had a point to make.  Go ahead, Voss.  Nothing. 
[02:06:30]  The finger went up and forget it.  Yeah.  How could he tell?  Couldn't see.  I thought you were raising a fist.  How could he tell there was a finger in there somewhere?  Those little fingers.  Wow, they are tiny, man.  Look at that hand.  I know.  You look like a guy who cut half his fingers off on a chainsaw.  You know the stubs that left?  You have stubs with nails on them.  I got small hands, too, though.  Not smaller than this.  I play baseball with golf balls.  That is a small hand.  It's like a Barbie doll.  Yeah, you really do have tiny hands. 
[02:07:00]  You have like a hamburger helper hand.  Just a little Pillsbury doll.  Yeah, whatever, right.  You can shake hands comfortably with a squirrel.  Ow.  Ow.  It's getting late.  Ow.  Ow.  Hey, we started a bit yesterday with Nick DiPaolo, and I think we could continue today.  It's a slow news day, obviously, if we're talking about claims of Bigfoot molesting people.  Uh, we got more slow news stories.  People are dying in Iraq. 
[02:07:30]  We're talking about Bigfoot.  Oh, I know.  I'm paying attention.  Over 4,000, my friend.  I know.  Wow.  That's not bad.  Uh, here's more slow news.  Five years.  Seymour, a rare white camel, is much better after being treated at the UW Vet Hospital.  His owners took him there because he was very weak.  He was given llama plasma and looked after.  After a few days, he got stronger and was able to be fed with a bottle.  Seymour's owners were happy to bring him home on Wednesday morning. 
[02:08:00]  They named him Seymour because, as they put it, he'll see more than an average camel.  Oh, man, you get ovary cancer.  Oh, Seymour.  Just for a pun, huh, Nick?  Unbelievable.  Cancer for a pun.  That's the trade-off.  They're not going to kill her, Mike.  They can take it out.  Again, just benign.  She's got another hump.  Just get her into radiation immediately.  No, he's all...  But Biggley is part of that new generation.  He's too mean and angry.  He made a homonym joke, so Nick is furious. 
[02:08:30]  I'm going to get a bumper sticker, save the camel.  Who cares?  Nick is all about the benign cancer.  Yeah, I don't wish real cancer was any benign cancer.  I just like to scare him.  Just so they have to wonder for about two months, you know?  Look, I wish to show him a look.  He's fine.  Oh, man.  I had a job.  You've got a book deal out of it.  I had cancer.  I don't know.  I don't want to tell a story, but I told... 
[02:09:00]  I had cancer when I was 19, but for like a week.  They found a tumor.  I swear to God.  I'm not even making this up.  They took it out.  It went away.  I go in every six months for a cystoscopy.  You know, they literally stick like a rod with a camera through your...  You sure they didn't take your funny bone out?  No, no.  Nothing on that one.  That was kind of good.  He was just sharing with us that he had cancer at 19.  He didn't have cancer.  I didn't think he was going for a joke. 
[02:09:30]  What kind of cancer?  Really?  Just for a week?  It was a bladder...  Well, it was this weird situation where I was driving home for Christmas break from...  That seven-day cancer plan?  That's what it was.  It was short-term.  I was driving home from Christmas break.  I stopped at a rest stop from D.C. to Boston.  I'm peeing.  There's blood in my pee.  Yeah.  Oh, for God's sake.  How do you think I felt?  You saw the bumpy road?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw it.  It was little droplets.  Like, poof, you know.  And I knew it could mean like five things and three of them mean I die.  And the other two aren't like a trip to the Bahamas either, you know. 
[02:10:00]  And so I drove faster.  I got home at like 2.30 in the morning.  I woke up my dad.  He's a doctor.  He's looked very grave because, you know, he knows about the Bahamas.  And so he took me to see a urologist.  And, like, I didn't know what urologists do at the time.  I was naive.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so I walk in.  He was like, put your hands on the table.  And I was like, all right, I can put my hands on the table.  And then he stuck his finger in the hand.  And I didn't know what was going to happen.  So I shouted.  I go, oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  And he got mad at me.  He was like, cut the theatrics.  Rookie.  Rookie, that's right.  Cut the theatrics.  Was it Bob Fosse?  But I felt awful.  I was like, I'm sorry about the theatrics.  Like, as though I'd intended it.  Like, this will be my big moment.  When he sticks his finger up my ass, I'll prove I should be the star of our town.  What kind of cancer was it, Bob?  It was a malignant tumor in my bladder that it didn't spread. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  I'm not going to wish cancer again on anybody out there.  Oh, it gets me so nervous hearing these stories, man.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Because Fosse has cancer right now.  He just doesn't know it yet.  I don't have cancer.  It's just my ass.  Oh, damn.  That cyst is just filled with Brian Piccolo's sweat.  We're all going to go visit you in a few months.  You're going to be all pale.  I know. 
[02:11:30]  I feel a little punk.  I feel good.  Today's a good day.  It's a good day.  I have my good days and my bad days.  Today's one of those good days.  Hold on, I just lost a tooth.  Remember, James kind of goes, I'm feeling a little punk.  All right, another slow news day story right here.  This one's terrific, though.  Police say vandals use signs and businesses as their canvas for destruction.  Ron Jones is in Stockton with who police are searching for tonight.  Tonight.  You know, we have noticed a greater police presence here on Pacific Avenue along with private security. 
[02:12:00]  But the one tool that may bring these vandals to justice is the city's surveillance cameras.  Caught on tape, several young men in the middle of the night casing businesses with one thing in mind.  What color?  Several businesses on Pacific Avenue were hit hard with buckets of paint thrown on signs and windows.  As you can see, after two men case the area, several others join in with spray paint.  Most of the graffiti has been cleaned off, but some merchants still see remnants. 
[02:12:30]  Stockton police are hoping this video would lead them to the vandals so they can build a case.  That one isn't as good, but basically it's the news reporting that graffiti happens.  Yeah.  That graffiti happens.  Don't worry, we'll come back strong here, Mike.  Don't look at me like that.  We've been doing this a long time.  We always end with a laugh.  Here it is.  Have you noticed?  Blue bonnets are beginning to blossom along the highways, but they may not be quite as spectacular as in years past. 
[02:13:00]  Experts say relatively dry weather over the past few months will make for just an average blue bonnet season at best.  A little more rain in the weeks ahead could help strengthen the showing.  We'll just have to wait and see on that.  Peak blue bonnet season is hard to pinpoint, but it typically comes during the first couple of weeks of April.  What?  What's he talking about?  What's that about?  They did a story on blue bonnet season.  Is that a flower?  What's he talking about?  Is it a flower?  I'm listening to that story getting mad, and I'm looking at Brian Poussain's ugly face and getting even more angry. 
[02:13:30]  Glad I spent the grand on my head shots.  I know.  Jesus.  It's those little blue flowers, like little blue purple flowers that you see on the side of the highway.  I thought it was butter.  Driving into upstate.  Butter.  Butter season.  Butter cups.  I have this thing where I listen to a clip like that, and after like five seconds, I'm gone.  You zone out, right?  It's white noise, right?  Yeah, completely gone.  Because you got cancer.  Oh, God.  I got ADD, which you, I think, have, probably, right? 
[02:14:00]  A little.  A little?  A little.  A little?  A little.  I had a hard time.  I was just thinking about this recently.  I had a hard time reading when I was a kid.  Yeah.  I think it was because when I would read these books, it would be like, there were four rabbits,  Mopsy, Flopsy, Cottontail, and Peter.  And I would think, like, if you're going to name your rabbit Mopsy, you really shouldn't  name the second one Flopsy.  It's kind of obnoxious. 
[02:14:30]  And, like, Peter's, like, the only one who made it out okay in the naming process.  He's, like, an investment banker now.  He's doing really well.  He's like, I do not know those other rabbits.  And while I was thinking about all that, the other kids read the book.  Three different hours, three nights in a row.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Caroline's coming up.  Thursday?  We're up to Friday.  Oh, is it Friday?  Hey, what are you thinking of that?  That is a joke.  Look at Rich.  Checking his calendar.  Yes, it's Friday.  I'm looking at my rabbit fur. 
[02:15:00]  He just did a rabbit bit.  That is a joke, but I'd venture to say that's funnier than you gave it credit for.  I don't know about that.  No?  You're not into it?  No.  A lot of people are into Peter Cottontail humor in Easter.  Peter Cottontail humor?  Whatever.  Peter Cottontail humor?  You're telling jokes about it.  I'm wearing it.  Ooh.  Yeah, you're wearing it, all right.  Remember when I said we were going to end with a laugh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You weren't talking about this hour.  Well.  Arlington Cinema Draft House.  That's it. 
[02:15:30]  April 18th and 19th.  Arlington Cinema Draft House.  Who, you?  Yeah, that's right.  Or your wife.  Or both of you?  Both of us.  Yeah, Arlington Cinema Draft House.  April 18th and 19th.  And you're also going to be at Bananas.  That's this weekend.  We already gave them enough plugs.  You really don't want to promote them, do you?  I did enough for them.  You don't like them, do you?  I did radio yesterday morning.  A call.  You don't really like them, right?  No, I do like them, but Arlington Cinema Draft House, April 18th and 19th, is, you know.  All right.  It's a big night.  Mike for Biglia?  Yeah.  It's a big plug.  Yeah.  Are you all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm good.  Caroline's this weekend. 
[02:16:00]  Are you getting sad?  You all right?  No, I'm totally good.  All right.  I just flew here.  I'm tired.  You're tired.  He's got cancer.  Get him a break.  He sleepwalks?  No.  He's got blood in his stool when he's got off a plane.  He teased that for never.  For never.  Yeah.  Next time.  Next time.  We'll rest that one.  It's a great story.  It's not going anywhere.  But Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Yeah, yeah.  Three different shows with Mike for Biglia.  That's very cool.  Sunday night, free DVDs to the first hundred people. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, that's Sunday night?  Yeah, Sunday night.  Nick, it's to you, my friend.  The big plug.  NickTip.com, and I'll be carrying Lisa Lampanelli's luggage at LaGladia tomorrow afternoon.  She flies off to a theater in Tampa.  Wow, you're really going to the website.  Universal Lampan Theater with Artie Lang next April 5th in L.A.  I'm somewhere before that.  I can't remember.  It's not important at this point.  You guys, what am I going to get an extra three hits on my website? 
[02:17:00]  Who gives a crap?  I love you guys.  You just don't know how to promote.  It just amazes me.  No.  Patrice finally decided to get a website like two months ago.  I'm like, get a website!  Patrice's Leather Jackets had a website like five years ago.  I'll show you a good market.  I'll show you a crappy comic.  All right, we got to get out of here.  We're off to the other place.  That's called XM Satellite Radio.  Thanks to everybody for stopping by today.  And you guys have a good weekend.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, you are.  The L.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[02:18:00]  Shock Shocks.  Shock Shocks.  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Paris, you were strip searched.  Was the search of something we like to call the old two-hander?  Did they do the old grip and rip? 
[02:18:30]  This is where payment is going.  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  He's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:19:00]  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  Don't let the coats fool you guys.  We really do want to be here.  I was going to say.  I know.  We have our coats on like we're ready to run out the goddamn door.  Don't let the coats fool you.  Is there a coincidence you have like 19 comedians in here and you guys have your coats on?  Yeah, maybe one day we can do that.  Just have a bunch of comedians and we'll slip out and see how long before anyone even realizes  if they do. 
[02:19:30]  That's what I'd do if it was my show.  Yeah, screw it.  You guys have been doing it long enough.  Let these assholes do my heavy lips off.  Yeah, go ahead.  Do it.  I've got to go.  That's what I'm starting to think.  I'm starting to think franchise.  That's what I'm starting to think franchise.  I'm starting to think franchise.  Yeah, the Dunkin' Donuts of comedy.  That's right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show, but they're not there anymore.  That's right.  And we get a little paycheck as we're on a beach somewhere.  Yeah.  I'm talking franchise, my friend.  I just opened an O&A branch in Calvary, Massachusetts.  Great.  Really taking off.  Good thinking, fellas. 
[02:20:00]  Who made the walk?  Well, everybody did today.  Nick DiPaolo, Rich Voss, Mike Birbiglia, all in studio.  I'll take my coat off.  All right.  What the fuck?  What were we talking about before we got here?  Because there was some good stuff going on.  Mike, you were bringing into his thing you were leading.  About sleepwalking.  Well, he did that over here last time.  Well, you know what?  I was actually thinking on that audio intro, the go screw moment.  Go screw.  Yeah.  That reminds me.  What's that movie about when stand-up stood out? 
[02:20:30]  There's this great movie about stand-up in the Boston comedy scene in the 80s.  Yeah.  We talked about that.  There's this great moment where I think it's probably Lenny Clark or something just says  to the audience, fuck you, fuck your family.  It's just good.  Fucking only in Boston is that a punchline.  That's right.  They kills.  That's true.  Well done.  Did you do comedy in Boston?  Not really.  No.  Wait a minute.  You said you're from Worcester. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I grew up in Shrewsbury.  So that line wouldn't work in Shrewsbury?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  In Shrewsbury, it's like we're going to the city tonight and they mean Worcester.  Yeah.  They're like going to fucking Worcester.  They go the other direction.  No shit.  I actually had a crazy Boston thing because I grew up a Sox fan and then a few years ago  they asked me to perform.  It's one of these things as a comedian.  You know how you guys end up...  You guys know this.  You end up getting asked to do shit that you're like, why are you asking me to do this? 
[02:21:30]  They asked me to perform the MVP awards for Major League Baseball and I'm like, maybe  they'd heard about my work as backup right fielder for Economy Paint Supply when I was  11.  Or maybe they couldn't get Regan.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's what it is.  And so I show up and I'm assuming I'm going to be a sideshow, pre-show.  They have me seated on the stage in between Dennis Eckersley, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, 
[02:22:00]  Dontrell Willis, and Josh Beckett.  We have a lot to talk about.  Great comics, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just hashing out our multi-million dollar contracts and paternity suits.  Just gab, gab, gab.  No, it was awful because, you know, I knew I shouldn't be there and they knew I shouldn't  be there.  And the guy in charge came up to me and he goes, we'd like you to tell a few jokes about  baseball.  I go, I don't know if that's such a good idea because those people are here.  And, but I try, you know, I try my best. 
[02:22:30]  I got up, I said, you know, it's exciting because I grew up in Boston.  I remember going to a baseball card show and paying $8 for Roger Clemens' autograph and  I'm sitting next to him now and he tried to charge me $13.  I don't know, I was all right.  Clemens didn't laugh at all.  Wow.  You know, just completely cool.  Just like we did.  Yeah, yeah.  It was not, it was not, it was not a.  Now you have four Clemens.  It was just, it was not unlike, it was not unlike the reaction just now.  But then I said about. 
[02:23:00]  Holy shit, Boston.  It's brutal.  He's just having fun today, man.  I like Mike, though.  We had to.  Yeah, I can see.  You love him.  Yeah.  I can beat the shit out of him.  It's like stabbing a baby in the eye.  Really, I have affection for this kid.  Yeah, because I was the hundredth and one person that came to a show and I couldn't get  the DVD.  Strike three.  Oh, wow.  I got greedy.  You get caught looking.  Listen to the story.  So I go, so I, it's baseball writers who put on the event. 
[02:23:30]  I go, what's interesting about sports writers is they don't know how to play sports and most  of them don't know how to write.  You know, there's people who don't laugh at that either.  And so I sit down.  I'm like, oh, it's fine.  Whatever.  I realize I have to pee, but I can't just get up because I'm on the stage.  There's a thousand people.  It's like at that Hyatt over a few blocks from here.  And so I choose like the most boring part of the night, the lifetime achievement award  for baseball writers.  You were talking again?  And I, no, what? 
[02:24:00]  I didn't even follow the logic.  So choose the most boring part of the evening.  He goes, what?  You, are you going to talk again?  See, that's good.  Very hysterical.  That's good.  You got to give Rich his props when he hits one.  That's the largest leap that Rich's head has ever made.  Let's keep going with this.  Yeah.  Back up and back up.  And what happened?  So I go to pee.  Why were you peeing again?  Roger Clemens offered you 14 bites over the air. 
[02:24:30]  Hold on, hold on.  I'll tell you about this story.  Basically, the reason I had to pee so badly is because I drank a lot.  Yeah.  Because I was like with, I'm sitting next to Roger Clemens.  Now, do you have cancer this week or no?  No blood?  Were you peeing or just sleepwalking?  Yeah.  What color was the pee?  So I sneak off to the bathroom.  I come back.  I'm coming back to the room.  The recipient of the award ends his speech by saying, you know, some writers may not know  how to write, but some comedians don't know how to tell jokes. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, you're fucking kidding.  And I'm not even on the stage.  I'm just, everyone in the room looks up at my empty chair.  Oh, like you were removed or something.  And so then I didn't know what to do.  I'm off to the side.  So in a split second decision, I decided to jog on stage and kind of wave like, hey,  yeah, I'm a good sport, you know, it's awful.  And I even walked by the guys.  He went to sit down.  I went to shake his hand and he didn't, he just walked right by me.  Oh, why would you, wow. 
[02:25:30]  Why would you even like do that?  Like to go to shake his hand.  Because it was just one of those moments.  I was like, I don't know what to do.  If you hit him or shake his hand, you want to punch him.  No, but you know, I was just, you know, because I was trying to think, you know, hey,  you could, you know, trying to make jokes.  I'm okay.  I'm a comedian.  I walked by him.  He just walks right by me.  And I look over at Eckersley and I go, Dennis, did you see that guy?  He's on a first name basis.  I have a cell phone.  And I go, Eckersley, you see that guy?  And he's trying to snub me. 
[02:26:00]  And Eckersley goes, ah, fuck him.  And I'm like, all right.  Shock up another save for the act.  Well, so here's where it gets bad.  The event ends.  When is this story going to end?  People are laughing at this.  I don't know what you're talking about.  We're all jealous.  I like stories in real time.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:26:30]  You think a guy with cancer in his hips, he might pick up the pace.  You should snuck off the stage like they were going to miss you.  Then Earl Weaver said, what?  If this were Voss's show, he'd be just glad that he bought 10 minutes with the audience.  He doesn't have to do the material he doesn't have.  Don't try to ad-lib through the story.  Just go right through it.  So I'm taking Eckersley's side. 
[02:27:00]  So I'm with my brother Joe who came to the event with me.  And I go, Joe, did you see that guy snub me when I tried to shake his hand?  I'm not making this up.  Joe goes, Mike, didn't you see his speech?  He's blind.  I was like, oh, no.  Not only had I insulted the blind guy, I taunted him by trying to shake his hand.  But the real evil one is Eckersley. 
[02:27:30]  Because he knew he was blind.  He still said, fuck him.  That's what makes him a closer.  So is that better than this bullshit you were talking about earlier?  That was a good story.  That was a good story.  That was a good story.  That was a good story.  That was a good story.  I don't like this part of the story.  This isn't entertaining enough.  I don't like this six seconds of the story.  I snuck off the stage.  Don't try to defend your...  I have the attention in the span of a ferret. 
[02:28:00]  But it's all right.  Because my wife is hotter than anyone that you could ever imagine.  I snuck off the stage like they were going to miss you.  Where did that big headliner go?  Shut up.  All right.  And take it.  Okay.  You did a dumb roast.  You didn't get paid for.  Okay.  They couldn't get Sweeney, so they called you.  Uh-oh.  Right?  Wow.  Get the boss going.  Excuse me.  Look at these three cunts, huh?  Oh, Jesus.  Look at them.  Talking about egg salad recipes. 
[02:28:30]  Just useless.  If their twats were pelts, it'd be a dime a dozen.  I got fucking...  Well, let's see what they're talking about today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pot them up.  Let's see.  I know.  I just love this image.  That's right.  Talk over each other, you slits.  I'm sure he's happy you shared that.  Yeah.  Anyway, what's your weekend action looking like?  We're going to have the biggest common mistakes women make when it comes to spring and summer  outfits.  What's that?  Douching?  Douching?  Douching?  Douching?  Douching?  Yeah, we got the wrong second.  White when you're bleeding?  Jeets. 
[02:29:00]  Plus, the right and wrong ways to battle those dreaded springtime allergies.  They're really prevalent right now.  Yeah, they are.  They're really prevalent right now.  A nice load your ass will take care of those watery eyes.  No, I know.  I do have allergies, but I went through water.  We're warm here yet.  On our radio show, this is...  Also, he was public enemy number one, but did Al Capone have a softer side?  Yeah, he did.  He died of the clap, you dumb twat.  He's fucking everything that moves.  Ask me, guys, in a warehouse. 
[02:29:30]  It's a thousand times day.  Anyway, me too.  You think you're going to emasculate fucking Capone now?  Yeah.  Can't leave a dead fucking angry giddy alone?  It's a thousand times.  It's a thousand times.  I mowed down a fucking garage full of guys.  Yeah, let's stick them up and ask them.  A lot of years in their lives, so they finally can feel comfortable about their bodies and  not worry about focusing on losing weight, but really how to be happy.  So we're going to find out what they do.  Listen to this psychopathical fucking bullshit.  Everybody hates it, and sometimes it's hard to make it stop. 
[02:30:00]  It's when your kids are whining.  The toddlers do it, the tweens do it, the teens do it.  You're doing it.  They don't have them.  Don't fucking have them.  What do you think they're going to do?  They're babies.  They're going to turn down that volume.  We are going to have some helpful hints for harried parents to give you examples of how  you can fix it.  Okay, and also we've got somebody here who...  We're going to show you how to de-clit something in the clinic night.  Yes.  And then she can translate your man.  In a few minutes, they're going to turn up the volume on our show.  Oh!  Translation right there?  Yeah, that actually didn't mean a translation, I think. 
[02:30:30]  But anyway, sometimes, you know, we don't always get what they're saying.  They don't always get what we're saying, so we need some...  What are you talking about, black people?  Let's just get a check of the weather from Bill Cairn, who's going in for Al all this  week.  Very well, man.  Go to the emasculated weather, man.  Yeah, there you go.  The seating hairline, small dick.  They make him sit in the cold.  My hairline is going bright.  He's standing in the cold while they're just yapping, yapping, yapping inside.  Let's talk of the...  Really ugly little girl.  I think the young diamond wrote a song about her. 
[02:31:00]  I was trying to think of something vile to say.  He just laid it out there beautifully.  Ugly little girl.  Ugly little girl he went to.  Let's pick out the little he-she in the hood.  It's so hard to find an ugly little girl, too, at that age, you know?  He's just like...  Usually there's something cute about him, but he picked the ugliest little fucking kid.  Let's see what the weather's like in this troll's neck of the woods.  Let's go to Chris, the trucker.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  You got a laugh for us, or what? 
[02:31:30]  No, no, really.  I just want to see if we can get the word out about the trucker strike that's going to  happen April 1st through the 4th.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we're going to shut...  A lot of drivers are going to shut down about the fuel, about the range, about everything  that's going on in the trucking industry.  Fuel?  What the fuck do you want?  How am I going to get my DVDs to the Funny Bone in Denver?  Well...  What's it supposed to do about the fuel?  Well, you know, fuel prices are real high, and, you know, it affects everything from,  you know, the grocery stores, the clothes, everything, and, you know, we're the ones 
[02:32:00]  that have to deliver it to everybody, and nobody, everybody takes that for granted,  so...  No, we really don't.  We kind of know that trucks bring us shit.  Yeah.  If I'm driving down the highway, does that mean I'm crossing a picket line or something?  What are they going to do to this?  It's just, you know, a lot of people take us for granted, the government, you know,  we're the ones that bring the stuff to y'all, to general everybody, and just the fuel prices  are killing the independent operator and the company, so that's why everything is going  up from milk, you know, to everything.  Look, we'll get you some more speed.  It's on the way. 
[02:32:30]  What I'm saying is just make your deliveries downhill.  Coast, brother.  Put it in neutral.  Really?  Put your factory in a hill in Vermont.  How about this?  Go back to fucking college.  Oh, come on.  Oh, shut up.  Fuck them.  All right?  Fuck them.  You know what these truckers make an hour, for Christ's sake?  These guys get fifth grade education, making more than all of us.  Jesus Christ.  Delivering the suspenders, though. 
[02:33:00]  Pass it on to the potato factory.  All right?  I got my own problems, all right?  Fuck you.  Fuck your family.  All right?  Oh, shit.  I'm enjoying Confident Voss, though.  This is different for you.  He'll ruin it.  It's amazing.  Yeah, let's say hi to this guy.  I don't know his name.  Sir, what do you have for the show?  This is the trucker's mother.  She's crying.  That was mean.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  What's happening, man?  Hey, you guys kick ass.  Hey, but the problem, you fucking make me laugh, man. 
[02:33:30]  You're awesome.  Thank you.  You need to talk these guys into letting you do that hour between you guys and Ron and  Fez again.  I don't.  That's my manager pretending he's a caller.  Yeah, here's the baby.  I know Mike the Christie in there.  They laugh to me, and they give this much of a hard time, too.  It's Richard Jenning, and y'all know where fucking he is.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  He's a splatterpuss man.  He didn't jump.  He hung himself, didn't he?  No, he did.  He blew his braids down to the tower. 
[02:34:00]  What?  What's the matter with these people?  Why?  Come on, Rich.  He's a good friend of mine.  Oh, shut up.  You're talking about my sis like it's Brian Piccolo's sweat.  He had everything going for him.  Did you give him a hard time when he was in the end?  Well, I'd like to hear this story.  Has enough time gone by?  Ah, yeah.  Break out the Richard Jenning disc.  We were going to play it the day after he died.  We were so excited.  We got something to play.  And then we decided maybe we should let some time go by.  All right, yeah.  Let's hold off on that one.  You know what Bonnie said when he... 
[02:34:30]  I actually like Richard.  There was a picture of Chris Rock, Jenny, and me from when we did the Oscars.  It was just us three.  Yeah.  And Bonnie goes, out of these three people, which one would you have thought would have killed  himself?  Oh, my God.  You guys are the worst.  Don't say guys.  That was Voss.  That was Bonnie's wife.  I mean, Rich's wife.  Yeah.  We got...  Well, Richard Jenny tried to do our show, and we made him wait outside, and then...  He was all...  He was getting pissed. 
[02:35:00]  Then he had to audition to, like, come in studio from a phone.  Because he was getting pissed off.  Even though we could see him through the glass.  So he made him do a prison visit.  We made him talk onto a cell phone through the glass door.  It's legendary stuff.  We cut it up recently.  He was so pissed.  We'll find it.  Uh, E-Rock's not here, unfortunately, because he needed three days off for WrestleMania after  we took a week and a half off.  You know.  This is the only radio show that has the staff behind the scenes, takes more time off than  we do.  It's amazing.  It's not like we've had everybody that's going to be in WrestleMania on. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Might as well send the crew out.  You got it.  Hey, all right, then.  This is brutal.  What is it?  It's the Richard Jenny stuff.  We'll listen to a little of it.  Well...  I'm going to be a puss and step out.  You can say all the mean shit in this segment.  What the fuck?  What kind of fucking...  What the fuck?  He was probably in the top five best comics in the 80s.  Probably.  Without any question.  All right?  Yeah.  But still, he was a dick. 
[02:36:00]  Fuck him.  He had a diva.  Wow.  I think what I need to say...  He was a bit of a diva, but, you know...  He was great.  I think what I need to say is that we did bury the old hatchet by the end of...  Yeah, right in his hands.  Whoa!  I know.  I'm trying to...  What is the friend representative in the room?  I'm trying to be...  Still having a hard time.  I know it's just to marry very well.  Mm-hmm.  No, I...  I know.  She used to work at Cats.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Great deal.  Great deal.  A lot of people are saying we ran this last week, but...  Did we?  Well, they did worst of stuff, but...  Well, just run a little of it, and we'll comment, and it'll be completely different.  It wrapped up in a different package.  It's our show, and we don't remember this.  Voss will insult a dead man.  It'll be great.  Oh, I'm the only one who's ever done that?  No.  You fucking trashed an old lady that was getting beat up in a fucking hallway.  She wasn't getting out of the way of the black gentleman, so he had to punch her in  the side of the fucking head, knock her in a walker over. 
[02:37:00]  You guys stayed 15 minutes.  15, it was like a half hour of laughing hysterically at some savage punching an old lady in the  side of the head.  Oh.  She reaches over to grab her pocketbook, and he clocks her one, and her hair goes flying.  The walker falls over, and you just see the little walker wheel going.  When was this?  Very recently.  Yeah.  It was a few months back.  I remember seeing it.  Yeah, it's on the news.  Yes.  Guy just walks in.  Straight right in.  She's coming out of the elevator, and he pops her a couple of times in the face.  Gives her a few jabs. 
[02:37:30]  What color was that, gentlemen?  Oh, he was, I believe, an African-American gentleman, and the woman was an old white  woman.  Yeah, it's a wonderful story.  I would have wanted to be Polish.  Yeah.  Yeah, you never know.  Well, here we go.  You just don't know.  We'll play some of the Richard Jennings stuff.  You know every time.  What?  Is him getting angry with you guys?  Well, it's involved, because then he put out a 9-11 CD.  Oh, you play.  All right, we'll start with this.  This is Richard Jennings coming to our show. 
[02:38:00]  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jennings.  Who's this?  Richard Jennings.  Hey, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy.  Thanks.  When are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in today.  Today?  Yeah.  I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  We made him call from the lobby.  Richard Jennings.  I mean, this isn't like...  I know.  It's not like Voss. 
[02:38:30]  It's not like this was Voss.  Thank you.  It's not like it's an open mic or something.  Top five comics of the 80s.  This is one of the level 1A, man.  They get that mean streak.  Yeah, well...  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  That's where you're on the phone like you are now, 
[02:39:00]  and then you step up to the glass on the door to the studio?  Right.  And you talk that way?  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny, that thing yesterday.  It was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It'd be funny if we hung up on you right now. 
[02:39:30]  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does.  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away,  and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first I was pissed off,  and then I just started cracking up.  It was so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go,  that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that,  maybe you shouldn't be on our show,  because we're juvenile.  Well, it's up to you.  I'm just hoping you put me on.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:40:00]  Come on now.  Are you serious?  What?  The gunshot sound effect?  Come on.  Like Mother Teresa or anything.  Now it's from outside, right?  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do you have to make the slippery slope argument  that Mother Teresa wouldn't put the gunshot  after the Richard Jenny clip?  Mother Teresa would have,  there would be a lot of degrees between  putting the gunshot sound effect after that. 
[02:40:30]  She was kind of a cunt.  You know what's funny?  If you go on the road,  like you would,  if you went on the road  and were doing a club  and two radio hosts did that,  you would never put up with it.  Like we would never,  nowhere.  Why do people put it up  with you two fucking jackasses?  I don't know.  If I was in Buffalo  and Shredder Reagan said,  stand outside the window.  Oh, really?  Go fuck yourselves.  Okay, one market douchebags. 
[02:41:00]  God damn, I'm just using them.  Well, that's because there's going to nobody  be at your show anyways.  That's a good point.  By this point,  we were syndicated to at least 20 stations,  so we had a little juice.  That's just the beginning.  Now we play good cop, bad cop well.  We've always done that  where we kind of,  I'll kind of keep whoever it is  on board a little bit  and Opie will just hammer away at them.  Yeah, you're holding him down.  Yeah, I'm holding him down.  Schoolyard bullies.  We've had people leave the studio 
[02:41:30]  in the middle of stuff like this.  They get so embarrassed  and uncomfortable  that they just walk off the show.  They're called advertisers.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Especially when you do  the gunshot thing  that anticipates his future.  They always walk out during that.  It's not like the first guy  that offed himself.  If we did a Freddie Prinze thing  and then I played the gunshot.  You're doing that right now, right?  Oh, yeah, that would have been ironic.  What was the joke,  you fucking moron? 
[02:42:00]  You didn't get that I was kidding?  I've been up since five, motherfucker.  I was defending you.  Fuck you.  Fuck your family.  Fuck it.  You know what?  I don't believe this.  I fucking don't even like you  and I was defending you.  You fucking cocksucker  with your fucking comedy devices.  You fucking hit the clubs  or off of it, Leo.  You turned on me.  Who were you inviting me  to your house?  You turned on me  to jump on his side.  I defended this prick  when he came in. 
[02:42:30]  I know.  Just fucking water down any if.  You fucking go out to L.A.  and do your faggy pun.  You fucking lack of charisma  fucking whore.  Sell your DVDs.  Hold on.  He's got the guitar.  Yeah, pull on your guitar,  you fucking hack.  Nick's like fucking  Siegfried and Roy's Tiger.  I'm trying to be nice  to this fucking guy.  Jesus fucking Christ.  God, am I happy  you turned on him  and not me, thank God.  Well, I thought  if we double-teamed  it would be too much.  Well, I wanted to. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, you guys think  I got no allies.  My publicist is in  the other room right now.  Yeah, fuck you too.  Go behind Bastard  with Black Joe's.  Didn't he kill Mitch Hedberg?  Oh, come on now.  Fuck you.  You're making fun  of Jenny, my friend.  Fuck him.  I didn't know  what I was at.  Fucking.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Fucking.  You got blood  all over your hands.  You're not going to end up  dead in a red roof in too. 
[02:43:30]  Fucking.  With 99 DVDs  laying next to you.  Holy shit.  Where does the one go?  I can't believe it.  I was doing the magic.  I'll never be nice  to anybody again.  the rest of my fucking life.  That's what you killed  yourself with listening to it.  I'm thinking we should  continue with the  Richard Jennings stuff.  I don't give a fuck  at this point.  This could be a good day.  I thought he actually 
[02:44:00]  thought that the fucking  gunshots were recorded.  He is that stupid.  Sorry.  Nick's like that fucking  bear that was sitting  next to that woman  in that crazy animal clip.  It was just kind of  sitting there and all of a sudden  wants to just rip  her fucking head off.  Holy shit.  One of my favorites  I love that one.  It's sitting next to the  big fucking bear dummy.  I feel like I'm at  the San Francisco Zoo  right now.  He smelled the trout  between her legs.  I'm fucking.  All right.  I'm feeling like  we should continue.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Why not?  Let's give it a whirl.  So last we left you 
[02:44:30]  Richard Jennings was  outside the studio  talking to us  and we were trying  to decide if he was  worthy of being  in the studio  with the great  O.P.  Yes.  Oh of course.  The great  assholes we are.  Then I think I start  by asking him  if he's ready  to be funny now.  Are you going to be  funny Richard?  Yeah I'll be funny.  Well I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure 
[02:45:00]  on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like what's the first joke  you're going to tell  on the air.  Stop it.  You're totally  putting him on the spot  here.  Any riffs on  things in the news?  There's lots of riffs  on whatever you  want to talk about.  Yeah.  But I got to be  in the studio to do  them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any  knock knock jokes?  He's laughing at  the juvenile stuff again.  Knock knock.  Knock knock.  Who's there? 
[02:45:30]  Uh oh.  Richard Jennings.  Richard Jennings.  That's a great comic.  Richard Jennings you're  hearing knock knock  because I'm pistol  whipping Opie and  Anthony.  Oh.  Pistol whipping.  Get it?  Richard Jennings.  All right Richard.  Can you give us a few  minutes to think about  it?  Prick over.  Yeah think it over.  Why am I a prick?  You were a prick back  then.  You must have been  raking in some dough  with that attitude.  Oh my god.  Were we just  rolling at it? 
[02:46:00]  Treating this guy  like an open mica  from fucking Wildwood.  Fucking 12 HBO specials.  I know.  Fucking making him  do dog tricks  in the lobby.  Holy shit.  We really needed  to be fired to get  humbled.  Yeah we needed  humbled.  We needed to be  humbled badly.  Nah you took it  like you're supposed  to do.  Push it to the edge.  Wow.  All right and then  I think he finally  made it in the studio.  There he is.  He looks like he's  going to kill us.  Richard Jennings.  Come here sit down man.  Are you doing this  or not?  Oh no.  Come on.  He's really pissed 
[02:46:30]  by the way.  It's all fun.  Richard Jennings.  Aren't you a good  sport Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh oh he looks  all uptight.  What's the matter?  You'd spend too much  time.  You're wasting time right?  It's like a waste of time.  See now you gotta be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here get on the mic.  Just let's see how much  we can screw with Richard Jennings.  That's what we're doing  on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh man a lot of people  are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently? 
[02:47:00]  I went on uh  Oh here comes a joke.  All right.  Wait.  Uh.  Wait.  Holy shit.  Roll that back.  I would have waited  before you were in the  parking lot with a  fucking bat.  I don't know if you guys  realize this might be  courtroom evidence.  We could be implicated.  Really?  Oh my god.  Wow.  I lost a little edge  because I can't even  imagine I would do that.  I gotta get my edge back. 
[02:47:30]  No.  No you shouldn't.  Really.  Wait till you get  those markets back.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Before the edge.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh man.  A lot of people  are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on uh  Oh here comes a joke.  Oh no.  That was a joke.  Come on Richard.  Richard.  Let me explain something.  Come on baby.  He's gonna conform to our show.  Don't say.  We're not gonna do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two  because Opie is 
[02:48:00]  Press button you big loser.  Press button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like  he's going on us  and we can't take it.  I was listening  and Opie is a prick.  You don't have a sense of humor?  You don't have a sense of humor?  Is that real silence?  Oh okay.  I thought that was like a  Well  And then I was playing  the be more funny  Homer clip.  Oh here comes the joke.  Oh my god.  Is that brutal?  That's just not even right. 
[02:48:30]  I had his manager.  I don't even like him  as a comic  but man  gee that's rough man.  As a human being  just treating someone like that.  His manager called me  the next day  because they knew  I did the show.  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on  with Opie?  What was that?  What the fuck  what am I?  They're a fucking publicist?  Honestly  Jesus  That guy should haunt  your fucking house.  No something went down  though which really  pissed us off.  I can't remember.  I know what went down.  I'm serious.  He was on Stern  trashing us  but then now he's doing 
[02:49:00]  our show it's like  what?  Oh is that what happened?  Oh was he trashing you guys?  I don't think he was  trashing us  but I think how he was  and he was kind of  joining in or something  chiming in  not directly  but saying you know  No no what happened  was you were just  you were fucking  with him that day  then he went on  Stern to promote  his 9-11 CD  No no no  No no no  No  Then he left  He actually did a few  minutes with us  and he was fine  he was good  and then  then he 
[02:49:30]  then he kind of  trashed us on Howard  and then  he actually  after that  was brave enough  to give us his  9-11 CD  which was literally  came out months  after 9-11  which we found  a little weird  so then  we started playing  clips of his  9-11 CD  that's what we're up to  It sounded like  you fucked his  girlfriend  I can't believe  he trashed you guys  on the radio show  after what you  fucking did to him  With nerve on that guy  Here's his  9-11 stuff  Well let's try  the next one  maybe the next one  is a little bit  So now we decide 
[02:50:00]  we're going to like  just go through  his CD  and we're going  to review his CD  live on the show  Well let's try  the next one  maybe the next one  is a little better  You know  last night  I turned on the  television  and Miss Cleo  was wearing  a fireman's helmet  She had a helmet  you know  she was all  I'm getting  into the firehouse  man  There's nothing 
[02:50:30]  more evil  than the fake laugh  There's nothing  more evil  You should know  I don't remember  this being  as brutal  as it was  Well I think  it's more brutal  knowing the guy's  not around anymore  This is horrible  because he really  pisses off  so alright  we're tracking  through your CD  now and we're  going to pick it  apart I remember  Now I know  I stayed away  from you guys  Miss Cleo 
[02:51:00]  and then I think  we can try  to explain  the funny  we called  the bit  we'll explain  the funny  Oh the  stars in the water  So Miss Cleo  why would  Miss Cleo  who is a Jamaican  Oh cause she was  showing her  support for  the firemen  Oh I got  I guess  I got  Cause it seems  like a lot  of people  are wearing  like NYPD  hats  Yeah  and fire hats  Yeah  So you take  it to the  nth degree 
[02:51:30]  and then like  someone like  Miss Cleo  would have one  on TV  and that's why  that's funny  because when  you exaggerate  stuff  Yeah  then it's  really funny  and she's  the most  ridiculous person  you could come  up with  I hope you  don't pull  back the curtain  I'm pulling  back the comedy  curtain  yes  when you  over exaggerate  and say  someone has  like a five  foot mule  it's funny  because  five feet  would just  be ridiculous  ridiculous  to the point  where that  would be  funny  right  I think 
[02:52:00]  the problem  with this  comedy was  I mean  I think  he was really  good in his  heyday  and I think  what happened  is he figured  out the equation  and then he  plugged in  numbers to the  equation  and it's not  as funny  you cannot  review  Richard  Jenny  he was  fucking  brilliant  the guy  had  like three  specials  he was  fucking  a great  comment  how did  you like  his 9-11  album  I didn't  listen to 
[02:52:30]  all I know  is when I've  seen him  or I worked  with him  I worked  with him  on the Oscars  he's  fucking  brilliant  notice I was  there too  and I haven't  brought it up  once  well that's  okay  I got two  credits  can I at least  every now and  I'm sorry  earlier he phrased  it when I was  on the Oscars  I thought he hosted  the fucking  I'm sorry  I'm wrong  and you're right  you're absolutely  right  I apologize  I'm sorry  but all I'm  saying is  there's nothing  you can say  negative about  his stand up  he was a  monster 
[02:53:00]  he was a  great comic  I know what  he's saying  there's a lot  of comedy  devices  you know what  I mean  but he was  a fucking  monster  there's no  doubt about  it  I've never  seen him  on a bad  set  I never  saw him  I've never  seen you  have a good  set  I think  you're a  funny guy  that's good  that's because  after you  introduced me  couldn't be  nice to each  other for more  than two hours  hold on  he's going  to the bag  I don't know 
[02:53:30]  I just thought  he was a  great comic  I agree  with that  statement  I also  sort of  see where  he's  you want  another clip  or is it  getting too  uncomfortable  well maybe  one more  Delphine Jersey  Richard Jenny  should turn up  that laugh track  I could barely  hear it  yeah  why was it  so low  well why don't  we try the  third track  that he sent  us Anthony  all right  Richard Jenny  this was  recorded at  the improv  in LA  I'm glad  you're here  you're in  a good  mood  see  people are  nicer in  LA lately  have you  noticed  they're a  little bit  nicer  a little 
[02:54:00]  more sense  of community  today I was  on a 405  I cut a guy  off and he  fired his gun  like over my  car  see  you know  he could have  hit me  he was like  eh no  problem  oh  what a guy  oh okay  okay  see that's  because like  they shoot at  each other  or they did  10 years ago  there on the  highway  no they have  a lot of  drive by  shooting  but the guy's  being nice  and he shot  over him  but it's  ridiculous  because  why would  he shoot  anyway  was that funny 
[02:54:30]  why doesn't  Jim Norton  want to  participate  in this  segment of  our radio  show  because comics  can't bash  other comics  unless they  know each  other  and are  good  friends  then they  could really  bash him  good point  good point  you guys can  shit on each  other like  Maxwell and  Cleveland  because you  don't work  with each  other  but you  know  Ron and  Fez  best of  friends  no we  love Ron  and Fez  that's a good  point though  about the LA  shootings that you  guys made  because it's like  guys come to  New York all the 
[02:55:00]  time they're like  yeah what's it  like in Brooklyn  and you're like  really nobody  really talks  like that  it's very  gentrified  it's all black  we got a Voss  clip here  Voss comments  on Jenny  were you in  studio that  day  you were  let's hear what  the great  defender says  let's go to  Rich Voss  Rich Voss  hey are you  sure this isn't  Norris doing  Jenny  you know  that could be  it  now 
[02:55:30]  now  who appreciates  my CD  now  your CD's  great compared  to this  crap  oh gee  there's a  compliment  your CD is  very funny  what's that  I like the  Voss CD  it is very  good  he thanked  all his  friends on it  you know  what the one  that's in the  store at  Border Books  has your name  on it  oh it's a  new one  yeah well  no it's the  same one  but they  just did  like a new  copy  a new  cover  what'd you  run to the  store  with little  stick-ons  stupid 
[02:56:00]  I had it  reprinted  whatever  that was  Norris  that was a  good reference  back then  oh Christ  remember  alright let's  go to this  track  well I say  nuke them  nuke them  damn it  yeah  if they're  stupid enough  to blow up  the World Trade  Center  we're dumb  enough to  nuke them  I hate  this  pry them up  put some  frosting on  them  tell them  in the mall  dirty air  take out 
[02:56:30]  the Cinnabon  put in  the Tally  bond  that's my  attitude  oh I  can't  yeah  that's  what you're  saying  fascist  damn it  and look  I don't  mean to be  xenophobic  or jingoistic  and I'm  sure I'll  feel those  way  even after  I find  out what  those  words  mean  I don't  know why  that one's  funny  here's the  thing too  do you  see how  we  it's just  15 more  seconds  I don't  know why  that one's  funny  do you  ant  do you  blue  on that  one  possibly  what 
[02:57:00]  that was  weird  you ever  get that  thing  where you're  just about  dozing  and your  leg kicks  that just  happened to  me  god that's  so weird  when that  happens  are we in  spots  no no  oh  what do you  mean I was  the dick  no I was  being a real  dick too  because he  wasn't there  first of all  so I got  brave  here's a little  something about  the show too  when Anthony  really starts  going you  know the  person really  pissed us  off  yeah  I would 
[02:57:30]  start problems  with people  I liked  I'm like  what's wrong  with me  the good cop  just leans  over and  takes the  phone book  to the face  of the  person  now it's  just bad  cop  this is how  the public  is though  back then  when he was  trashing the  Arabs  they were  applauding  and going  crazy  you can't  do it  anymore  you can't  even do  an Arab  joke  without them  getting up  tight  going well  they have  rights  too  is that  right  no  they don't  but what  I'm saying  the audiences  just get  they're just  babies  you know  oh fuck 
[02:58:00]  it sorry  you don't  understand what  I'm trying  to say  because I  can't  communicate  I don't  have a good  enough  vocabulary  to get  my point  across  what I'm  saying is  fuck  the  god damn  audiences  he called  in that day  didn't he  call in  oh my god  all right  we'll take a  break  I want to  fuck  Ann Curry  huh  want to see  what they're  babbling about  now  for this  reason  but one  of the  reasons  is  it's  ambush  makeover  friday  people make  special trips  here for that  so we scour  the crowd 
[02:58:30]  and found a couple  cool people  we promised to  introduce our  special  this morning  nice to see you  this is perfect  we have an  Asian one in the  middle  black one on the  right  maybe a mix  on the left  on this broadcast  talking about  the little  diversity  ways to get  around  that can make  your life a lot  easier  well this  morning  we're going  to talk  about the  huge response  we got  to some  of these  ideas  and we  might have  a few  more simple  times  this is what  women do  when men  aren't around  that's what 
[02:59:00]  they do  when we  are around  they don't  fucking pay  attention to  anything we  say  now do you  understand why  I shared a  room with  Voss  out of Miami  we'll take  a break  we got the  guys in  today  we got  Rich Voss  at Bananas  and Poughkeepsie  what's that  Leslie Nielsen  calling in  he's down  in the  lobby  let's make  him do  the fucking  bulletproof  window  I'm feeling 
[02:59:30]  good today  maybe we  should have  some old  school fun  with Leslie  Nielsen  Leslie Nielsen  killed himself  last night  now his  career has  company  that's a  good one  that's a  good joke  did you  just  think that  one up  that's a  good line  someone's  writing  Damian  Thomas  from  Akerity  writes  how dare  Jenny  trash  you guys  after you

[03:13:30]  you can get in a gym  or the most satisfying  feeling you can get  in the gym  is the pump  let's say you drain  your biceps  blood is rushing  into your muscles  and that's what we call  the pump  your muscles get  a really tight feeling  like your skin  is going to explode  any minute 
[03:14:00]  it's really tight  it's like somebody  blowing air  into your muscle  it just blows up  and it feels different  it feels fantastic  it's as satisfying  to me as coming is  you know  as having sex  with a woman  and coming  wow  so can you believe  how much I am in heaven  I'm like getting  the feeling of coming  in the gym  I'm getting the feeling  of coming at home  I'm getting the feeling  of coming backstage  when I pump up  when I pose out  in front of 5,000 people  I get the same feeling  so I'm coming day and night 
[03:14:30]  I mean it's terrific  how can we get this guy  in public office  is that amazing  that's great  coming  coming  by the way  because Rich  you started this  if you put in  Rich Voss Legend  because you said that right  4,600 views come up  on the Google  4,630  Mike Birbiglia Legend

[03:15:30]  you guys do this  every fucking day  we know not to fuck  with Leslie Nielsen again  we pay the price  we penciled him in  for this bit  and now we have to  make it up  well let's clean up  more stuff  there's plenty of stuff  to clean up  I like the Arnold  coming clip  that was funny  it stood on it's own  we have  is it raining  did you hear what  we did to Rich Voss  this is worth  one more play  yeah  you made him a name 
[03:16:00]  in the tri-state area  why are you giving me three  you're nice  that's what I do  I'm nice to comics  so they turn on me  Rich was talking about  his acting chops  so we set up  a jazz commentary  set up a  a little bit  where we were going to  have Rich do an acting scene  with who  Jim Norton right  yeah but here's the thing too  and he was going to read  from a Bronx tale  it really hurt his career  but we were saying  how fucking hard it is  to audition  it's the worst  oh it's awful  it's fucking horrible  three fags looking at you 
[03:16:30]  I know  Jesus  you never feel comfortable  coming out of one  so go ahead  you can do it  but all I know is that  can I  I'm sorry  good thing you  cleared that with Rich  first though  what the fuck  the fuck are you  the GM of this shithole  he doesn't know  he's going to do a live  raid in five minutes  seal it  he is way too cocky  today man  Ross is feeling his oats  I'm going to let you  have your day  because you're going to 
[03:17:00]  make the beating  next time you're in  that much better man  you're going to be  down in the lobby  calling in  tortured  so we set up a scene  that you were going to  do with Norton  from a Bronx tale  at the last minute  we did a switcheroo  surprised you with  Chaz Voluntary  he walked right through  that door  and fucking  Ross almost shit himself  that's hilarious  because I didn't even  have to  you don't have time  to fucking learn  the scene  you know  they just hand you  the paper  and do the fucking scene  you know  where's that fire  please don't tell me 
[03:17:30]  in the sawmill  you just start looking  going  I gotta get out of here  there's gonna be traffic  tanker explodes  in Massachusetts  is it masked  my dad drives  an auto-trike  in Massachusetts  wow you talk about  a strike  that wasn't  I have never heard  silence like that  and I've been  in the woods  camping  fucking by myself  in fucking Maine  holy shit  were you broadcasting  oh my god

[03:18:30]  it's fucking  fantastic  uh Rich Voskay  by the way  uh 715,000  links on Google  wow  alright so  I don't know  the guys put this  together  Derek and Steve  from that  that fine bit  we did  where we surprised you  Megan Kendall  Robert De Niro  it's not what you say  it's what he sees  in his directorial debut  we can't accept that  starring 
[03:19:00]  Chaz Pimentary  I didn't give it to you  I gave it to your son  and Rich Vos  Louis  Beans  I want my money  a bronc  tale  Beans  you can't dodge me forever  come on  what are you doing about  what are you yelling about  huh  John  I got a problem  with this guy over here  Louis Beans  this guy owes me 20  and it's been two weeks now  and every time he sees me  he keeps dodging me  John  should I crack him  one or what  the struggle  of an idiotic  Jewish comedian  stammering his way  through a few lines  of film dialogue 
[03:19:30]  with a genuine  Hollywood actor  listen see  sometimes violence  is not pre-answer  is he a good friend  of yours or not  nah John  I don't even like him  well there's your answer  right there  look at it this way  it costs you 20 dollars  to get rid of him  he's never gonna ask you  for money again  he's never gonna bother you  again  he's out of your life  for 20 dollars  come on  you gotta up cheap  you're right John  you're always right  a bronc  tale  how do you know  the right answer  all the time  Johnny  well I try to keep  my eyes and ears  open all the time  and I read  you read  yeah I read 
[03:20:00]  come on  come on  let's go to Mario's  next door  and get something  wow  isn't that amazing  that's a fantasy  but you know what  it's kinda cool  I think  that's like  doing like what  fantasy baseball down  and  with the old timers  these guys  these guys were  smash-man  we did it  we did it  a couple times  and I fucking  like an idiot  look at  he's reading  from the paper  and they're smashing  my bad acting  I go  he's not even  looking at me  he's not connecting  with me  so I'm basically  calling him  a bad actor  as he's fucking  doing it 
[03:20:30]  he's not giving me  anything  really fast  the google thing  has a wonderful  ending by the way  I knew it couldn't  be  I knew it couldn't  work out in  Voss's favor  so what  Rich Voss has  more google hits  or views  whatever  than Mike Birbiglia  by what  3000  yeah  right  and you were  feeling good  about that  right  I don't care  about google hits  yeah you do  no I don't  I saw it on your  face  no I didn't  secretly you were  very happy  that people care about you  I don't have anybody  working for me  why are you squashing 
[03:21:00]  what he's about to say  before he's going to say it  he's going to smash me  I know I have you  who cares  take it  take it  I take it  for six years  you've been hit twice  go fuck yourself  it doesn't matter  if he's got someone  working for him  behind the scenes  this is just people  trying to search you out  so it's based on  everything you've done  in your career  and you had  3000 more views  than Mike Birbiglia  and this is the  perfect ending  but he's doing comedy  40 years longer  listen to this  Peter from Canada 
[03:21:30]  yes Peter  one of the co-founders  of Amway  is named  Rich Voss  I knew that  he knew that  Rich Voss  Rich Voss  from that guy  this is fine  I want to invite you  to a meeting  a business proposition  tonight  but I can't tell you  about it  until you get there  is that the best  ending to that bit  because I know  you were feeling cocky 
[03:22:00]  first of all  you share a name  with a pretty famous guy  first hundred people  to a show  get Tupperware  yeah  let's  let's welcome  Leslie Nielsen  to the Opie and Anthony  show  Mr. Nielsen  how do you do  I didn't know  where you've gone  hello  hi  hi Leslie  how are you sir  are you  well  spell my name  of course  L-E-S-L-I-E 
[03:22:30]  L-E-S-L-I-E  right  yes  M-I-E-L-S-E-M  right  of course  we got rid of that  we had to get that  out of the way  and then  well now  you have another movie  coming out  you've become like  the king of these  parody movies  sir  well it seems to  it seems to be  but as long as  David Zucker  is going to keep  writing them  and keep working  with him  I'm going to keep 
[03:23:00]  doing them  and I have a lot  of fun  I love the comedy  I love the way  he does this comedy  and I like  being part of it  we should play  drunk or stroke  superhero movie  opens what  Friday sir  hello  hi  hi  I'm on a cell phone  I'm just digging  in and out  right  oh sorry about that  oh you didn't hear  what we said  yeah  the newest movie

[03:24:00]  start to do comedy  yes yes  who discovered  who discovered  that you had  a comedy edge  to you  well  that's the way  those things  happen  or come out  the thing is  that I was  always cast  as the  young man  the serious  young man  with background  who has a problem  yeah  so that's  you're pretty sure  that you're not  going to have  a comedic part  but then  Jerry and  David and 
[03:24:30]  Jim Abrams  came along  and they had  the part  of the doctor  in the airplane  in mind  for me  and I couldn't  believe it  it was a chance  to do comedy  something  that I had  wanted to do  all my life  was it really  hard to understand  was it really  hard to understand  the black guys  in the airplane  where they  where they had  to do the writing  under their talking  oh Jesus  Rich  I'm sorry  Leslie  that was Rich  Voss  he's an awful  awful person  founder of Amway 
[03:25:00]  I think he meant  comedian  he's an awful  awful comedian  they had a  screening of  what is it  a hero  picture  last night  and it  goes very well  I think it'll  probably  and hopefully  the people  will know  the name  that aren't  in the movie  you know  superhero movie  sir  exactly  oh you got it  superhero  yes  okay  stroke
