<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts riffing on silly emails before transitioning to a discussion of Kiss's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  Jimmy recounted a fanboy encounter with Ace Frehley, and the hosts debated the inclusion of rap artists like LL Cool J and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the Hall of Fame. A caller provided clarification on an LL Cool J video.  Mackenzie Phillips' Oprah interview revelations and Paul Stanley's comments on Kiss's longevity were also discussed.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Chuck Liddell's disastrous performance on *Dancing with the Stars*, prompting amusement and disbelief from the hosts and callers.  Numerous callers shared their reactions and observations about Liddell's awkward moves.

The conversation then shifted to Muammar Gaddafi's eccentric UN speech, with callers offering their opinions on his behavior and the international response.  His infamous tent and meeting with Louis Farrakhan were highlighted, along with extensive speculation about his motivations and mental state.

The show revisited a previous bit about a "rocker" with a demo tape before launching into a detailed, caller-fueled analysis of plot holes and inconsistencies in the *Back to the Future* franchise, particularly focusing on the Libyan's attempt to assassinate Doc Brown.  This segment concluded with a brief call from Larry King, commenting on the importance of audience entertainment.

A segment featuring numerous trucker callers followed.  One trucker hauled Hellfire missile engines, causing strong reactions from the hosts. Another discussed the UN's presence in NYC, suggesting relocation. A recurring theme was a countdown: "seven motherfucking days left" for "Cole fucking Cain."

The show then delved into speculation about Jennifer Aniston's relationship woes, humorously blaming a "smelly pussy," and discussed a reported emotional breakdown on set possibly triggered by memories of Brad Pitt.  Vulgar jokes and speculation about Brad Pitt's genitals, fueled by online images, ensued. A caller who worked setting off explosives in quarries described his job, which fascinated the hosts.

Backstage interviews after a Michael Moore interview revealed a surprisingly amicable relationship between Moore and Anthony Cumia.  The upcoming Mackenzie Phillips Oprah appearance, covering incest and abortion, was discussed with shock, humor, and vulgar commentary.  The hosts played snippets of *Mamas and the Papas* music amidst jokes and speculation about Phillips' relationship with her father.  A humorous discussion about the smell of mimeograph machines and ice cream sandwiches followed, concluding with Phillips' decision not to appear on the show.

A significant portion focused on dysfunctional childhoods. Opie recounted his father slapping him after he used his father's money for ice cream sandwiches (believed to be model rockets), detailing his father's depression, failed marriage, and failed ventures. Callers shared stories of parental flaws, including physical and emotional abuse, abandonment, drug abuse, infidelity, and even bigamy. One caller described his mother's death after a drunken fall. Another recounted his mother's affair and false rape accusation. One caller's father left on Christmas Day to start a new family; another accidentally killed his family dog.  Guests Andy Levy and Bill Schultz from *Red Eye* joined during this segment, which also included promotion for an upcoming show.

The final segment centered on Bill Schultz's graphic description of a gruesome, X-shaped wound from an Eastern European doctor, the lack of pain relief, and its infection.  Crude jokes and descriptions followed, with E-Rock present in the studio. Dr. Steve called in offering medical advice.  Tangents included listeners' cyst experiences, a misinterpretation of a newscaster, Anthony Cumia's *Red Eye* appearance, and his pistol permit pursuit.  Schultz, Levy, and E-Rock promoted their projects.  Graphic descriptions and obscene jokes continued, with a picture and eventually video of the wound shared on social media.

[00:02:30]  think like you're supposed to be a fanboy once when you see like ace freely or somebody for the  first time it's uh totally acceptable to be a fanboy but now you hang with the guy and you're  still being a fanboy well i asked him to sign the picture of me with the cake and also a cream  magazine that danny got me from uh it's a 1977 it's my favorite photo of kiss so i'm like if i get it  wasn't like i asked him to sign 50 things yeah i love the new album it's easy to say i love  that's all i'm listening to is the new fucking ace freely city anomaly i love it i bet it's being  played all over the place number one on uh the rock is rock radio playing it i don't know actually 
[00:03:00]  man i those fucking guys who knows we might have to like spin uh spin a track from the album i just  had to say that i liked it because i had nothing to say during the interview once again because god  felt playful and having fun with ace and ace is great and i'm just sitting there in the middle  uh i'm just awful oh hey we're going back to back and a belly to belly yep i'm on tonight  that'll be uh exciting for everybody they predicted a big ratings drop tonight oh did they really people 
[00:03:30]  must have seen last night and said why am i gonna bother watching that dribble tonight i didn't think  of that angle i don't like it phrased that way i'm hearing there's gonna be breaking news tonight  really very unfortunate yeah oh damn uh mackenzie phillips did she watch you jerking uncle loves  too i gotta love this girl oh she's a naughty naughty girl we could get right into the oprah audio  she was on oprah giving more details yeah but as far as the kiss thing paul stanley's in the paper today 
[00:04:00]  quoted saying it's like a 40 year old marriage talking about kiss without sex but how many 40 year  old marriages have sex anyway that's paul stanley of kiss on his four decade collaboration with gene  simmons profound and funny now gene is going to be like selling his shit going uh now we're uh rock  and roll hall of fame winners so now i can sell it by saying hall of fame winning kiss can i do that  now can i can i use the rock and roll hall of shut it you fucking pitch man well that's what they even 
[00:04:30]  get in i mean uh they're on the ballot which means you know also the ballot now ll cool j so they're  obviously expanding to rap and all that stuff but for kiss to have had to wait what do you mean  they're just going to be in no i don't think somebody say i think they pretty much nominate but then  just throw all the nominees no because i think sabbath was on the ballot like fucking nine years in a  row or eight years so what are some of the nominees i'll tell you who gets in uh i know kiss 
[00:05:00]  is one finally and uh chili peppers red hot chili peppers yeah and ll cool j it's mind-boggling with  his dumb deodorant uh you know fucking armpits from the famous video anyone oh anyone so he had  deodorant pits oh my god we'll try kiss oxyclean kiss oxyclean gets stains out  no ll cool j had a very kiss weed whacker he's just gonna take over where fucking of course he

[00:06:00]  embarrassing especially since he didn't have to wait he didn't have longevity right you're right  well i don't think he had longevity he doesn't belong in the rock and roll hall of fame no no the  rap hall of fame certainly or the hip-hop hall of fame without a doubt but not the rock and roll  thing i'm sorry it's a technicality it's supposed it should just be called the music hall of fame  obviously yeah i remember this hell of a cool j song but name a second one is acdc in is rush in 
[00:06:30]  rush isn't in you know how about you fucking work on that yeah how about you work on one of the  fucking best rock drummers ever is in the band yeah yeah ted pert yes i enjoyed playing lima light  i'm trying to see what the other uh genesis red hot chili peppers ll cool j 
[00:07:00]  laura nairo no clue jimmy cliff a few of us know the hollies and genesis that's it then hollies  uh huh jimmy cliff's a reggae singer there's some uh returning artists uh like the stooges  donna summer abba darlene love and the chantels donna summer and the rock exactly like they just ran  out of rock and roll there's just not as many black people in in rock quote unquote they feel 
[00:07:30]  like they need to have that's this need for diversity but if there's not as many black people  in rock hall of fame in rock then there's not just simply change the name and there wouldn't even be  an argument because you know what they're doing it's all it's it's the music hall of fame  yeah american music hall of fame basically uh let's say hi to josh in dc josh what's up guys  hey man good morning jimmy hi buddy uh opie i think the video you're speaking of is actually 
[00:08:00]  the mtv unplugged performance okay i don't even know if it's available to find anywhere i've i've  searched youtube many many times for that performance because it's actually really good he's got a full  band behind him yeah um and and uh horns and drums and the whole nine yards okay i suck no you don't  suck hold on a second you actually you actually liked ll oh he's gone he's bailed out he said he  sucked he sounded like he was a big ll cool j fan i want to know why ll i mean you'll listen to mama 
[00:08:30]  gonna knock you out and maybe another one that we're forgetting yeah but after that i mean you're  gonna go sit there and watch the whole show he did do like another song but i can't remember what  it is why the fuck would i even know and then he jumped into a few movies uh-huh and some parts  and some movies i think if you're gonna be in the rock and roll hall of fame or the music hall of fame  like the average person should know a few of your songs right you know if you only know mama gonna 
[00:09:00]  knock you out and none of us could come up with a second song then then what why that's not then i  don't think that's mass appeal then why ain't motherfucking fab fab freddy in the motherfucker  fab freddy put fab freddy in the motherfucker what about motherfucking too short fuck too short  what about too short motherfucker he belongs in there tom waits oh these are the ones missing sting  sting on his own because the police got a minute isn't in there for newman well let's see randy  newman has done a lot of uh soundtracks for movies and whatnot but he had a couple of you know

[00:13:00]  they have to  we gotta get behind chuck liddell  i'm dancing loey  oh it's funny  he's like a bull in a china shop  yeah yeah yeah  holy shit  and they gave him  just for the listeners at home  it's  it's barely dancing  they're just slowly moving around the dance floor 
[00:13:30]  it's like watching de Niro speak publicly  yeah it is  it really is  that is so out of context  that's what's funny about it  yeah  it's hysterical to watch  he's  he's so utterly bad  he's okay when he's doing the moves  but it's the slide  where he fucking loses it  where it's like  yeah he's supposed to slide  in time  across the floor  you know with the girl  and then  and then he's stopping  but as he's stopping  like his shoe grabs  and he kind of trips up a little bit 
[00:14:00]  and as he's holding her  and doing these moves  he's making like this face  where he's concentrating  on every movie  he's trying to make sure  he doesn't crush her to death  he doesn't have any sense of torture  fucking bruiser he is  snaps her neck  unintentionally  it's like watching Lenny  from Of Mice and Men  try to dance with a rabbit  holy shit  fucking Charlie  oh what a bruiser  Charlie's reminding me  because every time this comes up 
[00:14:30]  why do people watch  Dance With The Stars  Charlie's gonna remind me  Charlie  what's up  hey Charlie  don't you remember  the guy who called in yesterday  Ope  it's for the hot chick dancers  that's why we watch him  well  he was  he was a stewardess  yeah  thank you Charlie  yeah he was trying to defend it  by saying  no it's cause  there's some hot dancers  you could find hotness  all over the internet  you don't even watch  Dancing With The Stars  you get your hot chick  you can find hotness 
[00:15:00]  on the internet  but  unless it's Dancing With The Stars  you ain't finding  Chuck Liddell  looking like that  alright how do we vote for him  grandpa  give me a spell  that can make me dance  can we get Dana White on today  to talk about  Chuck Liddell's dancing  cause I'm sure he saw it  he saw it  what  no I was just thinking  like when you ask him  so what do you think  the silence on the other end  of the phone  no Liddell will beat  Dana White will beat up  Liddell's performance  this is the noise  you're gonna hear  Dana's gonna probably tease him 
[00:15:30]  Dana lost a lot of money  cause they had a bet  cause he didn't think  Chuck Liddell could get  the weight off  oh wow really okay  when I saw Liddell in Philly  he had a big fucking belly  people were like  oh what the fuck's up with Chuck  and that was only  I don't know  a month and a half ago  and now he's down to  fighting weight  someone like him  can get in shape  in fucking no time  yeah  get in that gym  do some of the shit  that guy's gotta do  and it's gone  you can only call  between 8pm and midnight  your local time zone 
[00:16:00]  but you can vote for Chuck  is it too late to vote  did we miss out  on the voting last night  for next week  he can do it though  he ain't gonna make it  unless  unless the UFC fans  are organized  he ain't gonna make it  through the first week  800  I can't imagine anyone  was worse than that  I can't imagine  anyone wouldn't want to  watch that next week  I know  can we watch it again  that's true  can we watch it again  I do want to just see  that again  I'm totally taken by it  what a lug  he's a lug  oh god 
[00:16:30]  if he was sitting here too  what fucking little worms  would he be  dude you got grace  you know something  we'd be like  who knew Chuck Liddell  could dance  exactly  wow you're doing a great job  hey look at that move  and you caught the hat  at the end  it's not far fetched  that he'll be on our show  to promote this  and then he'd be like  here's the grace  I love the little smile  he gives the awkward look  to start it  he didn't even put the hat on  oh my god  now he's just walking so far 
[00:17:00]  the scary almost trips  does a little soft shoe move  and then a couple twirls  and then he has to slide  his shoe's stuck  no  what do the judges say  do we know  is it worth playing  the judges  look at his face  oh my god  he looks constipated  Chuck's crazy 
[00:17:30]  oh Chuck is bad  oh look at this move  he slid  and then  he got a little hop  at the end  he caught some air  from his bad slide  he's so out of time  with the girl  oh my god  this is joyous laughing  what can I tell you  find a fucking video  yourself  that one slide 
[00:18:00]  where he just hops up  in the air  they all questioned  before he went out  why are you putting glue  on your shoes  slide  oh  I love the look  on his face  Chuck's not good  at smile  the only way  he's on next week  is if Kimbo  Slice is dancing  too  holy shit  he bobbled  the catch of the hat  too  he'd have trouble  beating fucking  Stephen Hawking  on a pogo stick 
[00:18:30]  Rob in Jersey  saying he can win  it all  why could  Chuck Liddell  win it all  there Rob  because it's not  about dancing  it's not about  how much you know  it's about how much  people like you  like all you guys  laughing about him  and saying how  you know  how he looks  kind of awkward  people love that shit  kind of awkward  understatement  he couldn't dance  it's terrible  Chuck looks  I'm sorry  we love Chuck Liddell  yes  and uh  I was gonna say  my wife  my wife loves  Chuck Liddell 
[00:19:00]  now she didn't even  know who he was  before  really  no we love the guy  but I don't think  we're brave enough  to laugh openly  in his face  I would tease Chuck  he looks dancing  the way I would look  fighting him  he's already made  it through to week  two by the way  oh good  he did alright  what do you mean  this is  George Hamilton's son  got kicked off  who's  Ashley Hamilton  George Hamilton's son  got kicked off  he got in a motorcycle  accident  he's all gimpy  and uh  yeah  he was  hold on  Chuck  I could do better  on seizures  with the stars  that was just  alright  so we're team

[00:21:30]  you did say that  I'm sorry  that's okay  yeah that's  that's  that's perfect  yeah  and Danny  I go to you now  because Mythbusters  did a whole  bull in a china shop  thing  yeah actually  they did  I know you love  that show  Blue Heeler  from Kentucky  actually Opie  the Mythbusters  disproved the term  bull in a china shop  they don't break  anything  they're pretty  graceful  yeah they would  just kind of  you know  I mean if there's  something in your way  you're not going  to go through it  so that's kind of  it applied to the bulls  as well  this kind of  went around stuff  now jolt the bull 
[00:22:00]  in the ass  with a fucking  cattle prod  and I think it's  going to start  knocking shit over  so if you smack  them in the balls  yeah yeah  kick them in those  big fucking  bull nuts  yeah  or put a lot  of red items  in the  no they actually  proved that too  they tested  different colors  to see what  if they had  any effect  on the bulls  that was a hack  joke but they  actually did that  they did it  sure  red china  in a china shop  well they did  they just did  flag colors  like red  blue  green  just to see  if any 
[00:22:30]  specific color  enticed the bull  it did not  get anything  over  it enticed  him  nothing  nothing broke  I'll look up  the results  but I don't  believe it broke  anything  did it have  big horns  I believe it did  how does it  know where the  horns are going  as it walks  down the aisle  it's kind of  like a cat  maybe it was  a bull  that really  liked china  I  nigh  okay 
[00:23:00]  I  nigh  his  face  is  fantastic  his mouth  is a  gate  this is  going  great  oh boy  I was only  joking  that's  funny  I'm  funny  let's say  hi to  tony  mississippi  tony  tony  good morning  what's up  hey 
[00:23:30]  while you guys  were on break  a little while  back  hbo did the  on real sports  did the story  about the  four football  players  whose boat  capsized out  in the gulf of  mexico  one survivor  just hanging  out on top  of the  upside down  boat  yeah  you were  wrong  opie  but the  real story  is even  better  what  happened  well  there was  four guys  that go out 
[00:24:00]  they do  as four  was on  the way  so  they do  their fishing  and they  start to  head in  the guy's  anchor  gets hung  up  so  the dummy  can I  get the  inappropriate  bell  here  one  one  of the  the  dumb  ding ding  ding  puts the  anchor  to the  back of  the boat  and basically  bails the  throttle  to try to  unhook the  anchor  and that's  how the  boat turns 
[00:24:30]  over  oh  okay  I read  the account  of that  so how  am I  wrong  my whole  point was  that they  were fighting  for the  one spot  that would  guarantee  that they  would survive  they  couldn't  get on  top of  the  there was  only that  one spot  like you  said  but the  only  one that  survived  he survived  because he  had gotten  sick  earlier in  the day  and it  was late  in the  year  and he  was freezing  his ass  off  and he  put on  layers  and layers  he had  a hoodie 
[00:25:00]  gloves  everything on  when the  boat turned  over  and that  is  subsequently  what saved  his life  because the  other guys  ended up  drinking the  water  and they  just froze  their ass  off  and went  crazy  lost  their  mind  and I  mean it  was  kind of  horrific  the story  how he  retold it  yeah he  told some  I read  I read  an account  in the  paper  it was  really sad  about how  the guys  as they  were dying  the one  guy was  regretting  his bad  relationship  with his  brother  and another  guy was  like the  way that  these guys  just fucking  emotionally  came apart 
[00:25:30]  yeah it  was really  sad  and how long  after the  boat flipped  over did  these guys  die  I think  they made  it about  24 hours  and another  horrific part  is the  rescue  crews had  made it to  them and  was hitting  them with  the lights  they just  never saw  them  you know  what's  amazing is  when you  read about  these people  that are out  there for  weeks  on end  and they  actually get  rescued  well this  was a  violent  storm  24 hours

[00:33:00]  asleep  so  where  should  it  be  i'm  for  that  though  of  course  get it  out  of  new  york  city  it  affects  traffic  had it  trying to  get  across  town  try going  anywhere  the whole  fucking  island  is  one  big  gridlock  get off  he says  the swine  virus  may have  been put  together  in a  lab  by the  military  they make  viruses  for  capitalist  companies  who will  make  vaccinations  and make  money  well you 
[00:33:30]  throw a  disease out  there  then everyone  has to get  the drug  to cure  the disease  and that's  a money  maker  it's not  far-fetched  yeah  I mean do  you really  trust the  government  and what  they're doing  behind closed  doors  yeah  Arabs  have not  and I'm  reading this  how it's  written  Arabs  have not  hostility  nor  animosity  towards  Israel  oh really  that's what  Gaddafi  says  what's all  that warring  thing  Arabs  have not  hostility  nor  animosity  towards  Israel 
[00:34:00]  so what  what's  with all  the  suicide  bombs  and  killing  and  everything  no  nope  okay  he goes  on to  say  at the  UN  yesterday  did  the  airplanes  on  9-11  take off  from  Afghanistan  these  planes  were from  Kennedy  Airport  this  fucking  piece  of  shit  you know  I'll tell you  something man  the US  government  I don't know  how to phrase  this  I will say  this  our government  should 
[00:34:30]  react in the  harshest manner  to this  fucking  piece of  shit  walking around  on US  soil  they should  react in  the most  barbaric  harshest  manner  why is it  they can just  do that  we're all  sitting there  going  he's right  there  grab  him  grab  him  the world  will be a better  place  he's right  there  just grab  him  unbelievable  throw him  in the  tombs  I was just  reading something  by the woman  whose husband  was killed  on the  Lockerbie flight 
[00:35:00]  yeah  and the fact  that this guy  is allowed  the fact that  our government  doesn't prevent  this guy  from leaving  this country  is disgusting  and we really  are a bunch  of dummies  how about this  he doesn't even  have an official  title  he's a strong  man  yeah  he doesn't  have any  title  he just  leads the  country  he does  no he  doesn't  colonel  well he's  got  he is a  colonel  you're right  which somebody  had a bit  years ago  it's like  he's in charge  of the whole  fucking place  right 
[00:35:30]  and he's been  colonel  caddafi  for years  like wouldn't  you just  make yourself  general  yeah  who's gonna  stop you  who's gonna  stop you  that's a very  good question  the guy  I guess he  likes colonel  yeah  he continues  jack ruby  he goes way  back in time  here  jack ruby  and israeli  killed lee  harvey oswald  why did this  israeli kill  harvey  the whole world  should know  that kennedy  wanted to  investigate the  actions of  the israeli  nuclear reactor  and how do you 
[00:36:00]  say this  dimona  dimona  d-i-m-o-n-a  anyone  don't know  all right  then he continues  leave afghanistan  to the afghanis  let there be  civil war in  iraq  well it's  something anthony  kind of has  has said over  the last couple  years  let them figure  it out  themselves  write it  yes  let them figure  it out  themselves  why the hell  are we in  there all the  time  so you  you agree  with this  madman  i agree  with colonel  qaddafi  with the good  colonel  where's his  tent  where did he  get to pitch 
[00:36:30]  his tent  and why  everyone was  very concerned  about him  and his  dumb tent  where is it  all i've  heard  well  trump  threw him  out  didn't he  of his  property  trump's  like what  the fuck  because it  didn't get  up to  him  and then  they started  building it  in this one  town and  then the town  said hey  there's no  permit for  this  why do they  have to build  this elaborate  tent  why can't he  just get a  room at a  holiday inn  like the rest  of the world  leaves  holiday inn  they stay at  the best  hotels  these cocksuckers  and he's  got to pitch  a big tent  somewhere 
[00:37:00]  he's afraid  of being  bugged  he's afraid  of being  mic'd  so he knows  you cannot  mic the tent  you can't  mic a tent  you stand away  with a parabolic  microphone  from a hundred  yards  and you listen  through his  thin stupid  tent walls  there you go  of course  i'd pitch a tent  right next to his  and just keep my  tv up real loud  like it was a hotel  i'd show him  can we drive  by this tent  where's this  tent  he's in our  secret service  protecting him  where's the 
[00:37:30]  tent  our secret  service  is that  they gotta  you know  so much  security  taking care  of these  guys  so much  this fucking  animal  and then they  give this guy  this lockaby  bomber  and boy did  Obama snub  fucking that  jizz bucket  gordon brown  oh yeah  that release  of that bomber  is another  a snub  isn't as  strong as  he should  have been  Obama kind  of like  you know  bring up  the dead  people  bring up  lockerby 
[00:38:00]  bring up  you know  this guy's  been a sponsor  of terror  for years  guy was  fucking  battling  reagan  for love  of god  reagan's  been dead  for how  long  i understand  reagan was  alive  six years  now i guess  perhaps more  than great  no i mean  Obama snubbed  gordon brown  from  england  yeah from  england  he should have  done more  than just  snub him  though  they said  it was  very embarrassing  though  like he really  embarrassed him  did he  yeah like he  really bitched him  i guess that's a big deal  in world politics  when you refuse to have  unilateral meaning  whatever the fuck 
[00:38:30]  and by the way  is the guy dead yet  no  no no he's fine  no no he's not dead yet  that should have been a deathbed  they should have had to take him  on a stretcher  if you're gonna do this  mercy fucking thing  where the guy's you know  fucking prostate is  is gone  or whatever he had  uh  they should move him out  on a stretcher  and the second he reaches  libyan soil  he should be like  oh it's great to be home  and just die  the guy's still alive  isn't that  still alive  wasn't that about  prostate like a pineapple  and he's still alive  wasn't that about a month ago 
[00:39:00]  at this point  yeah  that's disgusting  are you living the life of riley  are you for or against  that whole mercy crap  against against against  I am completely against  that mercy crap  if you're a bank robber  or if you commit a crime  that humanity can understand  yes I'm for it  but if you're a fucking  like Chuck Liddell's dancing  no I said that humanity  can understand  oh okay  yeah okay  I'm with you there Jimmy  you murder a plane full of people  I'm flip flopping like a motherfucker  no but you know  I see your point  with that fucking 
[00:39:30]  and that disgusting country  he went to  those fucking animals  gave him the hero's welcome  where they praise him  like  oh I fucking hate them  we got Rob  he's got a great observation  Rob  hey there Rob  it's the Opie and Anthony show  good evening  hey Rob  hey  hey yeah  is this me  or does Gaddafi look like  Governor Patterson's  evil twin brother  that's pretty good  the nose  the eyes  I don't know  I mean  I kind of see it  he looks like Carmine Ragusa  I kind of see it  it's not aging well 
[00:40:00]  no  he's getting fatter  he's getting fatter  he's getting fatter  he's not aging well  he's been around since  I was 12  how old is this fucking guy  67  that's it  yep  67  so he started leading the country  as a 20 something year old  that's not amazing  that's kind of weird  he still lives  let's go to Bill  in Virginia  prisoners no God  Bill what's up  unless God just wants to take  the good people in  Scott is Allah  good point  and they love what he's doing  doing a great job 
[00:40:30]  alright you're right  who knows  hello Bill  yo yo  I had an uncle  that was on one of those  UTA flight  77s  back in 89  blown up by  one of Kudavs  relatives  but a little known fact  back in the 60s  he used to actually  go to England  on a regular basis  for schizophrenia  treatment  so I don't know  oh is he a schizophrenic  I don't know  no but I don't know  nice one Bill  yeah I'm with you Bill 
[00:41:00]  I think there might be  an issue or two there  and you know what  that caller should have  got a little more  reaction on the  David Patterson thing  there's a resemblance  there  there's something going on  thank you Bill  and of course  fucking Farrakhan  met with him  it's like you know what man  I understand  you hate Israel  you're sympathetic  to certain Arab  causes  yeah  and certain Muslim  causes  but to meet with  this animal  you fucking  anti-American  ass  he should not be  allowed in the  United States  sorry  you gotta do all 
[00:41:30]  your stupid  speeches via  satellite  that's it  Rob  what do you got  hello guys  hello Rob  Libya is a weird  place man  they've got  they used to have  like true communism  where for example  nobody actually  owned a car  you could just  drive a car  anywhere  park it  and then  someone else  could just  pick it up  and drive it  anywhere  as well  how does that  work  in a society  how do you get  home  really how does  that work 
[00:42:00]  and Kadabi  is known  even though  he's supposedly  a rich guy  he lives in  like a tent  in the desert  and he's lived  there for years  yeah I remember  when Reagan  bombed it  yeah but it's  not just a tent  I mean it  is better than  you know  your house  my house  aunt's compound  oh it's amazing  it's like one of  those tents  they put up  for a big bank  with  and I guess  he knocked down  there's a lot of  like you know  historic sites  Roman sites  in Libya  and he knocked  them all down  with a bulldozer  but he didn't  order them  knocked down  he actually 
[00:42:30]  drove the bulldozer  and knocked down  it's fun  every guy likes  driving heavy machinery  imagine we had  a lunatic  running this country  and they just  decided he has  to get rid of  monuments and stuff  just jumps in a  bulldozer  yeah plows over  the Lincoln Memorial  you think we would  allow that  sure why not  probably  more ravings  of a loony  Gaddafi yesterday  at the UN  Somalis  are not pirates  we are the pirates  we took their fish  we took their wealth 
[00:43:00]  took their fish  there's plenty of fish  how does he explain  that they chop  each other up  with machetes  over nothing  and the warlords  control everything  over there  and the people  are broke  because there's  a few warlords  that are rich  and they keep  everybody at bay  over there  just stop it  this next one  will infuriate  a lot of people  pretty much everybody  and he's just  walking around  Manhattan right now  right  yeah he's strolling  around  I saw him at  the Apple store  I think he was 
[00:43:30]  buying something  for his iPod  well he's taking  in the sights  and you know  in the eye touch  yeah  why are we  against the Taliban  why  those terrorists  who hit New York  City  are they Taliban  are they Afghani  no  they trained  he's asking  the tough questions  they trained  Al Qaeda  over there  and  they were fun  people too  nothing better  than taking  in a good  soccer game 
[00:44:00]  and beheading  jeez  and they also  they were housing  Bin Laden  yeah  and we were given  the option  where they gave him up  right  but they refused  right  and so we kicked  their fucking teeth  and that's what  happened  they were given  the option  they chose  not to take it  I'm sure much  to their regret  now they're coming  back with a vengeance  yeah well  it's because  again we're just  dumb  we don't finish  the job  no we don't  finish the job  and now we have  a weakling  in the White House  which  you don't like  Obama  what 
[00:44:30]  I will say  didn't we have  a Democrat  in the White House  though  when World War II  was finally  wrapped up  in a nice little bow  Democrats  and Republicans  were different  animals back then  that's true  completely  I'll kiss you  Chris on Long Island  Chris  morning boys  hey  I don't know  if you guys remember  but after we  went into Iraq  Mr. Gaddafi  threw up his arms  and threw out his weapons  because he didn't  want a piece of it  now that Mr. Obama  is in office  he's shot like  a madman again  yeah he actually  denounced  a bunch of 
[00:45:00]  terror  and terror states  he was coming  across like  he was a good guy  because didn't the  UN put him in charge  of the  like security council  or something  they did  yeah they put  Gaddafi in charge  it was some sick  move that everyone  went what  him  and then he came  out saying like  you know hey  I don't know  I'll turn my back  on all this terrorism  and everything  and yeah  that was when  Bush was on  his bombing spree  and now  he comes back 
[00:45:30]  with his loony  loony antics  this UN  do they get  anything accomplished  at the UN  nothing  yes snarling  traffic  for real  what do they get  accomplished  the leaders all  get to speak  their minds  and then they  go back to  their countries  I come out  of that  midtown tunnel  and the traffic  coming in town  through the  midtown tunnel  is backed up  for I swear  to you  at least  five miles  of dead  stop traffic  that's fucking  that's 15 minutes  is it  because you know 
[00:46:00]  is it  take care of them  before you take care  of your  your own people  make sure they need  their motor  make sure they're  comfortable  and happy  they should have  just walk around  like everyone else  does  exactly  absolutely  they don't need  to drive  they're going to do  build a fucking  hotel underground  at the UN  and make everybody  stay there  hey good idea  how about you  stay there  that's a great idea  hotel uncut  how about  well one of those  undersea hotels 
[00:46:30]  like that girl  was talking about  right there in the river  by the UN  oh and they could  stay in that  busty moldy  smelling  underwater hotel  well guys like  Qaddafi  how about we take  over retard island  retard island  make it one big  fucking hotel  Roosevelt island  right  yeah they could  ferry them over  and no one gets  no one has to  worry about  the traffic snarl  I like it  continuing  we got two more  from Qaddafi  a peaceful country  like Yugoslavia  we destroyed  we come and  dismantle it  for imperialist 
[00:47:00]  personal interests  yeah  who owns that  do we own it  what happened  how are we so  imperialistic  when we don't  own anything  we don't go in  there we don't  pay a discount  prices for anything  because we have  bashed in a  country's face  what happened  and then finally  this might drive  Anthony nuts  Qaddafi says  we would be happy  if Obama  would stay  forever as  president  yeah  see that's good  and Fidel Castro  praises Obama 
[00:47:30]  there's something  to be said  when these world  leaders  that are tyrants  dictators  and they love  someone like Obama  because they know  they could pull  their shenanigans  with impunity  but maybe they  won't act up  because they  like Obama  no  they'll be  acting up  they will  absolutely be  acting up  alright we found  the tent  you guys  what  let's say  hi to Paul  in New York  Paul  where's the tent  good morning  fellas  hey  yeah the tent's 
[00:48:00]  located in a town  called Mount Kisco  actually right near  the Clinton  right near Clinton's  house  really  yeah  that's nice  and what's going  on up there  can you even get  close to the tent  there's a lot of  protesters  and people going  crazy  does he even  notice  that everyone  is really  not happy  that he pitched  his tent  in Mount Kisco  and just pitching  his tent  is funny  if you ask me  yeah  of course  he's pitching  a tent  let's go to  Sean in North 
[00:48:30]  Carolina  Sean  good morning  boys  hello Sean  can we pick up  Gaddafi  for okaying that  hit on Doc  Brown  back in 1985  oh man  I'm so sorry  I didn't even hear  what you said  he's like  I'm so sorry  is it a real  back to the future  thing  I don't even know  what'd you say  Doc Brown  did he order  the hit on Doc  Brown  what is he getting  at  I don't know  the Libyans  see the Libyans  needed the plutonium  because Doc Brown 
[00:49:00]  was going to build  them a bomb  but he gave them  a bomb casing  full of old  pinball machine  parts  and he kept  the plutonium  to power  the DeLorean  so he could  then go back  in time  but then the Libyans  were on to him  you remember  he goes  Libyans  and then they  chased him  in a Volkswagen  minibus  for some reason  with one guy  hanging out the top  shooting his AK-47  and then he got  a RPG  and was going  to shoot that  but of course 
[00:49:30]  Marty McFly  was able to  take the DeLorean  up to 88 miles  an hour  right before he  hit the photo booth  and go back  in time  but the Libyans  in the Volkswagen  minibus  right into the photo booth  so you knew exactly  what the guy  was talking about  oh hell yeah  are you kidding  I had no idea  please  you need any more  detail on that  I'll be willing  I'm willing to  no please no  you're okay  oh no  Danny why  Danny yes  you know  Danny wearing his  back to the street  and so is Travis 
[00:50:00]  so it's very embarrassing  oh wow  fuck  but when the Libyans  come for Doc Brown  they're at the  Twin Pines Mall  yes  but when they  later in the movie  once everything happens  because Marty plowed  over one of the pines  going into the past  yes  he returns to the  Lone Pine Mall  yep  because it's only one pine  that's right  because he changed  he changed  you'll kill my pine  yep  and that changed  history  and then what happened  well Marty went back 
[00:50:30]  and actually  well Marty wrote a letter  yeah  see  to Doc Brown  warning him  about the night  that he goes back in time  that the Libyans  do in fact  shoot him  and of course  Doc Brown  doesn't want to know  anything about  the future  because it could interfere  with all kinds of things  though there is much  hypocrisy in that  because he does  ask Marty to take  the hoverboard with him  back into the Old West  which is very silly  why would you do that  but he read the note 
[00:51:00]  finally  we find out at the end  he did indeed read the note  and  donned a  bulletproof vest  so when the Libyans  shot him  and  Marty McFly yelled out  no  twice  he was fine  he was laying there  he opened up his  blab coat  and there was the slugs  because he read the note  because he did read the note  and then you know what  Marty asked him  what about  hey Doc  what about all that talk  about knowing your own future  and you know what Doc Brown just said 
[00:51:30]  what the hell  he said  you know Marty  fuck it  he's a very irresponsible doctor  yes  yes  I mean look how the movie ends  in the first place  I mean Doc comes back  from the future  to warn Marty about his kids  so it's just like  right there  he's given up too much  about Marty's future  affecting the future  his whole thing was like  this infernal machine  oh my god  it's affecting  the past  you can't affect the future  you can't do this 
[00:52:00]  but everything he did  fucked with  the future  by telling people  what was going to happen  and he couldn't just leave  well enough alone  he added then  after the DeLorean  was busted  finally for good  Doc decides that  he's going to build  another time machine  out of a fucking train  out of a train  with his kid  Jules and Vern  do you think  he destroyed that  when he went back  into the past  back into AG-85  no  he didn't get rid  of that train  all he wanted to do  was get that DeLorean  back and destroy it  because it's  too much responsibility 
[00:52:30]  but then he built  the train  and by the way  the train hit the DeLorean  the train didn't stop  when Marty  finally came back  the train didn't stop  Marty went home  comes back  and there's no cops  what the hell  is with Hill Valley  not one cop  on the scene  to say  wow you know  something  a car got hit  by a train  perhaps we should  even in the  he's got his head  on a rolled up sweatshirt 
[00:53:00]  I'm reading the paper  he's got his head out  I didn't even know  his head was on a sweatshirt  even in the  original timeline  of 1985  Hill Valley  it wasn't exactly  the best kind of neighborhood  in the first place  so you really can't expect  police response time  to be  you know who I blame that on  Mayor Goldie Wilson  Mayor Goldie Wilson  who was going to make  be the best  the greatest mayor  Hill Valley ever saw  and by the way  Mayor Goldie Wilson  fucked Hill Valley up  it's terrible  just enough said  I think  there's a parallel  between Mayor Goldie Wilson 
[00:53:30]  and President Barack Obama  1955  with the  with the white mayor  yeah  you had no bums  Hill Valley was clean  wasn't it great  it was a nice theater  in the town square  bring me a dream  bum bum bum bum  make it  it's all playing  in the other  fast forward 30 years  and the clock tower  doesn't work  the movie theater  is a porno theater  bums sleeping on park benches  on the California raisins  bench  all under Goldie Wilson's  watch  nothing  Goldie fucking  Wilson  that's a good idea 
[00:54:00]  I could run for mayor  colored mayor  that'll be the day  colored mayor  that'll be the day  well  let me tell you  something there Lou  let me tell you  something there Lou  of Lou's Cafe  it's going to be  a bigger problem  than Goldie Wilson  for mayor  oh  you alright  no  you feel a little  more refreshed  I just slept  to the future  holy shit 
[00:54:30]  I forgot how much  fun that could be  that's fantastic  this Saturday night  Saturday Night Virus  will replay the  really  Back to the Future  episode  are you  for real  sure  is that a good one  1.21 Jingle Lots  there you go  does that mean anything  of course  power needed  thank you  the insane amount  of power needed  to take the DeLorean  back in time  remember when  did you answer the question  have we  arrested Gaddafi 
[00:55:00]  for all this shit  oh was that a question  yeah that's what  the caller asked  Libyans  right Libyans  he's right there  why aren't we arresting him  for the attempted  hit on Doc Brown  that was the original  question right  that is  but Doc Brown  would then implicate  himself on  stealing  plutonium  someone wants to know  Libyans steal it  and gave it to him  to make a bomb  yeah  this is a very good  question from  Booger Couch  Booger Couch  Booger Couch  morning boys  hey  hey Ann  I find it funny  that you know  all these details  about fictional  characters from  Back to the Future 
[00:55:30]  but you need  a computer program  to learn the names  of your ancestors  well if I had a DeLorean  I could just go back  and ask them  yeah  but this day and age  I have to use like  Ancestry.com  or something  hey can I ask  Jimmy a question  you certainly can  Back to the Future  sure go ahead  no  oh then no  oh hold on a minute  then no  I'll hang up on you  as people laugh  the sad part is  I didn't really mean to do that  to the poor guy  I really didn't 
[00:56:00]  that was a fuck up  on my part  Chris on Long Island  what's up  hey Chris  yeah I'd like to take  a DeLorean back  five minutes  and slap Opie in the face  of making this thing start  what a waste of time  and what a waste  of that power  that plutonium  to just go back  five minutes sir  Anthony Larry King  is checking in  Larry King  it's a pleasure  to have you on  the Opie and Anthony show  thank you  how important  is entertaining  your audience 
[00:56:30]  go  Scott in Virginia  Scott  Ed  we did it  you know  everything  about Back to the Future  so does Danny  and Travis  fuck  see and he wouldn't  be wasting plutonium  to go back five minutes  because he probably  has a Mr. Fusion  hooked up to  you got a Mr. Fusion  so you can just pour  some Miller High Life  in there  and there you go  then you're fine  and the can itself  and the can  why didn't he just 
[00:57:00]  drop the whole thing  and Jimmy  let's talk through  our phones for a while  talk through your phones  seems like the future  you know you could buy  those futuristic  Doc Brown sunglasses  I think I might  pick me up  wow  and you can see  through them  I think so  Jimmy  do you like me  Sandy  you bet I do  let's go to  Vulture Squad  Vulture Squad 
[00:57:30]  what do you got  hey guys  what's up Anthony  I got a hot item  for you bud  I was outside  the Libyan mission  yesterday  trying to get  photos of that  scumbag Gaddafi  for a local paper  alright  and they put us  so far down the street  we couldn't even  see anything  and some people  are saying  well you know  they gotta protect him  if somebody kills him  I kind of understand that  but I was searched  I saw a guy  from the UN  where the dog  actually let the dog  stick  they told this guy 
[00:58:00]  another video guy  they said  put your bag on the ground  the guy says  that's my breakfast  just put it on the ground  they let the dog  stick his nose  in the bag  and this isn't the best  this isn't the worst of it  as we're all in this  little pen  down the street  where we can't see anything  who comes up  but  Louis Farrakhan  idiot  and waltzed right in  they treated him  like he was a king  and he waltzed right in  there to visit Gaddafi  how can we let this  happen in this country  well because we're  a free society  you know 
[00:58:30]  you gotta let that  shit happen  unfortunately  it doesn't make  people happy  but  they were handing out  t-shirts guys  that said  America welcomes  Gaddafi  stick to my stomach  brothers  stick to my stomach  it doesn't  yeah we don't have  to make t-shirts  that's for sure  yeah  that's not in the  constitution  thank you  vulture  well someone's  gotta be the  neighbor to the  tent  someone's gotta live  next door to the  tent  you're right  and Andy the  trucker  Andy what are you

[00:59:30]  happier to be  alive and shit  when you got a  nice load  do you know  what I'm trying  to say  yeah the thought  goes through your  head of how bad  you just really  fuck things up  if something  happened  well I'm sure  they're not  stacked up like  potatoes  you know  you don't think  they're stacked up  all willy nilly  I think they're  in protective  casings and  stuff  I would just  imagine if like  you know one of  these tough truck  drivers if they got  a load of let's  say like tampons  yeah  they don't feel too  good about themselves  embarrassing  as they're driving  down the highway  it's very 
[01:00:00]  embarrassing  but if you're  Andy with  fucking engines  for fucking  missiles  you've got to  feel like you  got a 10 inch  10 inch cock  hello  no I am not  the iron sheep  pleasure for you  anyway what do  you got Andy  okay  the UN's  fucking up New  York so bad  it's not even  funny  I guess it is  two problems  I just send  them fuckers to  Detroit and  fuck their  economy even  worse  what do you  mean  why can't we  what do you  mean what do 
[01:00:30]  I mean  why can't we  just move the  UN out of New  York and put it  somewhere else  for real  they've said that  for years  they'll never  probably because  the leaders  wouldn't come to  Detroit or anywhere  else you know  they're enticed  by coming to  New York City  it's like it's  you know  in the end  they're looking  for a nice  free trip too  just  yes  it's not a  problem  alright Andy  thank you sir  take care guys  alright brother  let's go to  Dan the trucker  another trucker  check in  what are you  hauling  love you guys

[01:02:00]  and uh  Obie brought up  Obie brought up  the theory  that perhaps her  pussy smells badly  because she's  really hot  even for a  40 year old  she's hot  Obie brought up  the theory  that perhaps her  pussy smells badly  like it's a theory  we have to credit  Greg Hughes  it's a theory  why else can't she  keep a fucking man  what's wrong  with this broad  she can't keep a man  because she's not  one of these  Hollywood starlets  that kind of wants  to just be single  doing her thing  like she makes it  very clear  she wants  she wants to  settle down  she wants to  settle down  find a nice guy 
[01:02:30]  so it's got to  be her pussy  yeah it's got to  be her pussy  well apparently  there's a little  more than that  uh oh  what's going on  well she burst  into tears  on the set  of a new movie  she's filming  here in New York  oh no do tell  in her trailer  do tell  and uh  her assistant  came up  to you know  check make sure  she's okay  and everything  and asked her  why she was upset  and you know  what her reason was  the scene she  had just done  she said  it just reminded  me so much 
[01:03:00]  of Brad  Brad Pitt  of course  who has moved  on and is up  to seven kids  he's got  18 kids  from every corner  of the globe  and one from  I think Venus  and he's  completely forgotten  about her  she should really  realize that  you know  he's  he's  he has moved on  but now it's making sense  because you might put up  with the smelly pussy  yeah  but you ain't putting up  with Brad Brad Brad Brad  Brad Pitt Brad Pitt Brad Pitt  Brad Pitt  every two seconds  while you're trying  to bang this  blood injury  yeah you're trying  to get your  yeah

[01:04:00]  a movie out of the blue  we'll watch  Fight Club  can we watch  Fight Club  hey  Jen  can we just watch  a fucking movie  without Brad in it  Brad  it's not about Brad  it's just a good movie  I don't know  it's not Brad  and what's that smell  oh  I'll be right back  I got to scrub  she's just  any guy  you know  you bang her a few times  that's fine  but how many times  do you want to hear  about this  fucking Brad Pitt  or right  never  first of all 
[01:04:30]  it's Brad Pitt  you don't want to hear  about any guy  the last guy  you want to hear about  is Brad Pitt  okay who you are  you're gonna feel  a little  you know  self-conscious  yeah that's  that's not good  Anthony  you know what  the truck  Jennifer Aniston  saved Brad Pitt's  voicemails  that's another one  oh boy  revealed that she  saves  voicemail messages  from old flames  in an interview  Aniston said  I still have  the cassette tapes  of message  of messages 
[01:05:00]  from my first boyfriend  my second boyfriend  my husband  it's like saving  love letters  does that make  anyone else's  heart  a little sore  it's such  a girly thing  to do  and I can just  imagine  Aniston  cross-legged  on the floor  filled with  filled with  a bottle of wine  crying  while listening  to all her past  I love you's  this chick's  out of her  fucking gourd  that's nuts  she's nuts 
[01:05:30]  that's fucking nuts  man  do you have some  no  I thought you were  gonna say  that's nuts  by the way  I have some  never  when I first  when I first  started working  with Dice  like back  ten years ago  he left me  a couple  messages  that I saved  because I thought  it was cool  that Dice  called me  but there were  some funny messages  but no  I can't comprehend  oh yeah  when Sharon  called  but to say  from a girlfriend  never  I'll never  want to hear  those again  never  is that Brad  Pitt's cock  let me see  he's got a good  piece on him  I didn't mean  to say it  that quickly  wow  Jimmy  gotta keep  that to yourself  sometimes you

[01:27:00]  now they're just  embarrassed by the  whole thing  now they're just  I gotta say  that's why  we're so great  we hammered this  into the ground  like at first  they're like  yeah we're  into this  now they're  like oh fuck  we gotta figure  out another way  around their  studio  you know why  it's a combination  of the awful  song and the  fact that that  hallway is the  quarter mile long  and they have to  walk down it  listening to that  horrid song  trying to be  cool about it  anyway back to  mama cast 
[01:27:30]  this fucking  pig of a woman  she was big and  fat  a rumor by the  way that she  choked on a  ham sandwich  that is a  rumor that got  started  well she certainly  didn't choke on a  cock  who the fuck  would shove  their meat whistle  down that throat  I think her aorta  choked on some  plaque  yeah  really  yeah  she was in  England I believe  and she died  was she still in  the band  with the band  together  no no I think  she was soloing  at that point  she was really  in love with I 
[01:28:00]  think the other  guy who isn't  Papa John Phillips  what the fuck  was this  just say the guy  who wasn't  fucking his  daughter  yes  the other  who wasn't  fucking his  daughter  yeah and that  like that  haunted her for  the entire time  the band was  together and  afterwards because  she could never  have him  and she watched  him you know  banging people  let me go to  Eric in Jersey  we're getting our  mamas and  papas info out  for everybody  Eric  Eric  it's not  John Phillips 
[01:28:30]  it's Ted  Phillips  not everything  has to be  Ted  yeah  I have a mouth  full of bagel  good timing  Keith J from  Niagara Falls  wants to know  how many pig  years did she  live  I don't know  is there a  difference  how old was  she when she  died  get the fuck  out of here  I'm looking at a  woman well into  her 40s  nah it's that fat  really did her up 
[01:29:00]  yeah  yeah  but back to what  we were talking  about the people  that were  fucking  their daughter  which was  John Phillips  okay  well  Mackenzie Phillips  is all over the  place promoting  this book  and you know  if she didn't  have this little  tidbit of having  sex with her  father she  wouldn't be on  Oprah  she wouldn't be  half the places  she's going  these days  yeah  but she  wow  what a bombshell  if you're going  to write a book 
[01:29:30]  what the fuck  you might as well  throw a bombshell  in there  when American  Graffiti came out  I was in love  with Mackenzie  Phillips  I thought her  character was  very like  cool  really  oh yeah  yeah  at that age  I don't  it was like  I don't remember  it was like  oh wow  oh  you know  she spent the  whole movie  in the car  with what's  his name  there  I can't remember  his name  the race car  guy  they don't  have one  picture of  her from  American  Graffiti  she was like 
[01:30:00]  a tomboyish  kind of a  dykey thing  but you know  she was just  kind of funny  so yeah  you know  your little  boy movie  crushes  yeah I just  don't know  much about  the movie  and now I  know I  probably could  have knocked  off a piece  absolutely  and you  probably  can still  knock it  knock a  piece  out  probably  watch your  language  buster  that's my  daughter  looks like  someone swallowed  their bagel  Ted Phillips  is eating  and he's  back  yes hi  I didn't like 
[01:30:30]  the name of the  band  I wanted to  call it  the parents  why the parents  that's a horrible  it was too hard  to say  I was always  on drugs  what kind of  drugs were you  on there  I would do  everything  one time I  ate 30  Flintstone  chewables  and I fell  changed first  with a cat  box  Gregory  mama cats  had to pull  me out  by my  ankles  really  I don't  know where  to go  with that  one  the guy 
[01:31:00]  asked me  too soon  I was  eating  bagel  I had  it open  I was  going  a little  a little  a little  a little  a little  a little  a little  a little  a little  I was  always very  noisy  when I  did that  Gregory  could you  sing one  of your  hits  there  huh  I know  you don't  have any  mamas  around  but maybe  you could  try a  little  song  today  oh maybe  Travis  can play  one  to remind  Jim Norton  of what  the mamas  and the  papas  actually  sang  we'll go  with  California  Dreaming  that was  a big  hit  oh yeah  this one 
[01:31:30]  you know  this one  I certainly  do  this is one  of my  all time  favorites  alright  we'll be  quiet  there are  many leaves  around me  no  the sky  is a  pink in  color  no  that's  not how  it goes  you are  what  a walk  you're walking  why are you  playing this  music behind me  on a  winter's  day  yes  a  winter's  day  I was a  loser  but now  I'm a  winner  it's not  winter  you're  misinterpreting  the lyrics  it's a  winter's  day

[01:35:00]  I'm belting my toodlies.  He certainly loves the toodly-doos.  Mamas and the toodly-doos.  So let's get to the audio.  So Mackenzie Phillips is on Oprah, and she's telling Oprah a lot of shit.  A lot of stuff.  Yeah.  About having sex with her father.  She really ought to learn how to mind the pacing cues.  Oh, Uncle Ted.  Damn Tattletail.  Tattletail.  Well, even in a book years later, that's just plain Tattletail.  I told John, I says, I think Mackenzie's got a big mouth.  She tells tall tales. 
[01:35:30]  Tall tales.  Telling tales out of school.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Kaz called me crying.  She goes, Paul, I think something's going on.  She knew my wife and I were estranged.  Estranged?  Yeah.  My wife had a fire.  What was your wife's name?  Ethel.  Of course.  She was burned over 94% of her body.  Oh, Christ.  I got an insurance settlement.  Oh, you got a settlement?  How much?  What's that?  How much?  $1,400 minus the expense. 
[01:36:00]  Nice, huh?  $1,400.  Was she burned on her face?  Was that part of the...  The only part that wasn't burned was her shins to her calves on the right leg.  That's terrible.  Yeah, but she was very proud of it.  She would go out in ski masks and knickers to show off the unburned part.  Oh, ski masks and knickers.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It scared me.  Why?  I don't want to answer that.  We went on a cruise.  She just kept dangling her unburned shin. 
[01:36:30]  Everything was covered in gauze with macetration on it, except for her shin where she tanned.  And she painted her three surviving toenails.  She's a mess there, Paul.  Yes, she was.  Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I was injured.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  So, a couple highlights from the big interview with Oprah.  Mackenzie Phillips.  And I can't explain this away.  It happened. 
[01:37:00]  And, I mean, it's all in there.  How did it finally stop?  Well, I became pregnant.  And I was in a relationship with my son's father as well.  He knew nothing.  He's one of the dearest men and one of the best parents to our son.  He's a wonderful, wonderful man.  And he was always there for you.  Always.  I would have left me. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You know, thank you for laughing.  Yes.  We need to laugh.  He's a terrific father.  And Shane's a terrific son.  But I came up pregnant.  And I did not know who the father was.  Oh, boy.  Jesus Christ.  Well, if only Maury was around then.  He could have had her on.  DNA test.  And Papa John, you are the father.  Oh, and then she runs back crying. 
[01:38:00]  Throw this mess in a dumpster.  What use does she have for society?  She has had a very tough life.  Yes.  So how about when it was all going down, she talks about it?  Well.  Father's dead.  I mean, it's just.  It's hard.  Now you're telling that story to make a lot of fucking money.  Well.  Well.  Maybe she wasn't ready to.  Oh, really?  Back then, it was still too close.  And now years after his demise.  His demise.  Celebrating my third wife's demise. 
[01:38:30]  Big old Chinaman pulled my arm over it.  And now she feels she's got time.  So you have sympathy for this one?  No.  Oh, good.  Implications.  The reality of that.  Yeah.  I had an abortion.  And I never let him touch me again.  Oh, well.  You never let your father touch him?  Never.  Because you didn't know if the father was your father.  That's correct.  What? 
[01:39:00]  I didn't know.  Did you tell your father I became pregnant and I.  He paid for the abortion.  But did you tell him that this might be your child?  Well, he didn't.  He knew it might be his child.  Paid for the abortion?  All right.  How about half and a ride down to the clinic?  Hey, I'm trying to do business over here.  Jesus.  Nothing says happy.  The dream police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Nothing says happy Father's Day than an abortion. 
[01:39:30]  The boo police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Look, we'll get one of those abortions.  Mackenzie Phillips got one once.  Abortions.  I think that interview would have been a little different.  She's going on Larry King.  Is she going on Larry King?  She'll end up on Larry King, right?  Oh, that's going to be one for the ages.  Papa John clipped or unclipped?  Mackenzie, comment.  Did he put it in your freckle?  As they say in Australia. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, wow.  All right.  Where does she go with this?  Where does the I Had Sex With My Father tour stop next?  I don't know.  She's going to do all the talk shows.  I mean, if she's done Oprah, where do you go from there?  Hey, you go everywhere.  Maybe with Larry King.  It ends with Larry King, right?  How about it ends with the Opie and Anthony program, where she comes in here and we talk  a little bit about it.  That would be all right.  Let me play the...  Is that going to happen?  No.  You don't think so? 
[01:40:30]  No.  Why not?  No.  Why not?  We're good interviewers.  I wonder if she ever told Valerie Bertinelli in confidence.  Like, they'd be talking and she'd go, oh, Eddie Van Halen.  You should see how he fucks.  Oh, my God.  We did this, that.  And then she's like, oh, my dad.  Let me tell you.  You should see the cock on him.  Zoix.  I wonder what Ann Romano would have said.  Ann Romano would have gone to Schneider for some guidance.  Oh, Pat Harrington? 
[01:41:00]  Pat Harrington would have gone, I don't know, Miss Romano, with his fucking cigarettes rolled  up and just said, it sounds okay to me.  Can I fuck her, too?  He was always trying to...  Wasn't he always trying to get Miss Romano, Ann Romano?  I don't remember.  I was in love with her, but...  Do we have any Schneider audio?  It's always good stuff.  You knew there was a...  That's just...  Problem.  It's just gold.  Schneider.  Hold on, guys.  We got Larry King checking in.  Yeah, was he a huge character back then?  He sure was.  He was everything.  He was just a huge sitcom character. 
[01:41:30]  Like the Fonz.  Let's go to Larry King here.  Larry!  Yes, boys.  Yes.  Hi, Larry.  Morning.  Morning.  Mackenzie, how important is the coat hanger?  Oh, Jimmy Crickets, you absolutely...  Larry.  Do you think they used a coat hanger?  No.  How did...  What did they use?  They just went to the, uh...  Uh, I would guess a doctor.  You think?  Trampoline?  That little over trampoline.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, is that Pat Harrington now?  Oh, God.  That time.  Tick-tock.  Oh.  Tick-tock.  Tick-tock.  Oh, he's got the dead eyes.  He does.  Nothing worse than old people with the dead eyes.  And he's got the denture mouth.  Their eyes die before their bodies.  Denture mouth.  People with dentures talk.  Yeah, they're talking over their dentures so they don't fall out of their head.  It's like, well, this has been a very interesting experience for me. 
[01:42:30]  Like, all right, we understand.  Your fucking teeth will fly out of your face if you actually pronounce an S.  Do you say good morning to the river every morning?  I say good morning to the river every morning, and I say good evening every night.  And I've made some marvelous, fantastical friends here.  And I'm jumping the river.  As Spock talked to you in Star Trek.  Oh, God damn.  I've come back here to make sure certain things aren't happening. 
[01:43:00]  It's like, what year is this?  You can't figure out how to grow new fucking teeth?  Like, there's Leonard Nimoy talking over his dentures.  His giant dentures.  They can transport themselves everywhere, but they can't figure out the teeth in.  Captain, it is your own best destiny.  Remember, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the screw of the one.  What?  What, Spock?  What are you saying?  Are you saying it took you out of the movie a little bit?  It took me out of the movie a bit when it's like, you can't fucking grow new teeth in the future. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, you're a Vulcan.  You don't have effort in it.  You don't want to think of Spock not trying to knock that little plastic thing off the fucking nightstand.  I didn't know what was wrong with his voice.  I did not know what was wrong with his voice.  That is so talking over your dentures.  People have such a problem with talking over their dentures.  They're constantly using the upper lip to try to hold them in.  They are, right?  So they can't quite talk properly.  The essence is very difficult.  Do we have any audio of Spock from that?  Can we hear a little bit of that?  Oh, Travis has some Schneider audio. 
[01:44:00]  I'm sure it's a loft riot.  He was always, oh, the cut up.  He was crazy.  Yeah.  Mano, you have been divorced one year.  I have been divorced ten.  Ten years of nobody opening a window and you wanted it closed.  Ten years of not waiting to get into the bathroom.  Ten years of getting into the shower without being slapped in the face by a wet bra.  How long were you married?  Three weeks. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, gosh.  That was a number one show?  You kind of think it was.  Oh, look at his dentures.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Looks like he ate a fence.  It really does.  Yes.  I am not Spock.  I have many other talents.  It's not like Tom Brokaw now.  Why do they always have to be big teeth?  I don't know.  Did you just file them down?  How hard could that be?  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  Little chiclets and just pop them in there.  What the fuck?  Like patty.  Giant fucking choppers.  Big, giant fucking dentures.  You don't want to bring attention to your fake teeth to begin with.  So why wouldn't they just be kind of small?  Maybe he wants to be able to eat small green apples out of people's hands.  Scanning the planet, Captain.  Scanning.  Oh, look at him there.  Look at his teeth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  What happened?  Did we have him on the show?  I don't remember.  Yeah, on the phone.  What's his saying there?  Live long and prosper.  As he said. 
[01:45:30]  Live long and prosper.  Live long and polydent.  Oh, look at those things.  They're fucking huge.  Wow.  There's no way that fucking actually.  Those are his teeth.  What happened?  High on arrival.  What's that?  Oh, is that her?  That's my jerk.  I fought her for the weekend.  Mackenzie Phillips book.  That's Mackenzie's book.  Oh, fuck.  You got it?  Yeah.  You got it.  Pictures?  Is she coming in? 
[01:46:00]  There's pictures on the cover.  I mean, inside.  New book.  You like new book smell.  Who doesn't?  It's really good.  She's coming in?  Sorry, Jim.  Oh, it's my mic.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Working on it.  She's deciding whether or not she wants to do the show.  I mean, type of the publicist.  She had sex with her father.  What does she need to decide?  I think she's got some kind of morals.  What the fuck's wrong?  There's a judgment call she's got to make?  She's got to make a judgment call.  And she's wandering around talking about how she had sex with her father and abortion from  her father.  And she's not sure if she can do this scourge of a fucking radio show. 
[01:46:30]  We should probably do this off the air.  Yeah, perhaps.  We should see what her...  She might be deciding if she can do it.  Maybe she's not here.  I think she just decided.  She heard this break.  Do you know how insulting that is to us?  Well, let's see what it is.  She is doing a lot of press.  I think she's doing Larry King on Friday because there's CNN on her schedule.  So I'm going to find out.  We're worse than consensual incest.  No shit.  Thank you for getting it.  What the fuck?  She looks sexy in this picture with her dad with her leg up.  With her dad with her leg up.  Oh, I was looking at that one in the paper today. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, let me see that one.  Let me see that.  Yeah.  That's fucking...  She's latched on to him like...  She was never hot.  Come on.  No, she has a weird kind of thing going on early on before the drugs really fucked her up.  It was something.  I can't say it.  Why are you sniffing the pictures, Jimmy?  I love the smell of the new book.  Everyone, every boy does.  Okay.  Every boy.  With Oreo, I love this.  I just needed to know.  It's like smelling dittos when they used to come off of the mimeograph machine.  It's a mimeograph. 
[01:47:30]  Ann.  Yeah.  Chill.  Sorry.  Forgot.  Half the audience has no fucking idea what you just said.  Well, with the old printing press.  I remember when the old printing press was...  We got to make believe we didn't live in that time.  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.  And then you go...  But it was like cocaine.  A cold fucking cane!  Because it would only last for such a short period of time.  And then you'd try to get another hit off of it.  But once those hit the air...  Like when they were stacked up...  Right.  Wait, you actually got a little buzz off that? 
[01:48:00]  I just like the smell.  No, no, not a buzz.  The smell itself.  Oh, okay.  The smell itself was pleasurable.  So, you know, if you want to call that a buzz...  I mean, it was kind of nice.  You'd get that...  Ah, that's good.  But then it would just go away.  Right.  And you'd sit there sniffing and you're like,  Eh, it's gone.  Right.  Smells gone.  Need new dittos.  Steven S. makes a very good point.  No, he doesn't.  Ever.  He's talking as Mackenzie Phillips.  Oh.  It's official.  She's not doing the show.  She just said,  I'll fuck my daddy, but I won't appear on Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  That's great.  What happened? 
[01:48:30]  That's so fucking great.  What happened?  She's deciding if the show's right for her, I guess.  Oy.  Let's say hi to John in Georgia.  John.  Hey, Anthony.  If you have Mackenzie Phillips in, please only do the interview in the Da Moan voice.  Hey, Mackenzie.  Isn't this great?  We'll get one of those abortions.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I need the money now.  That would be...  You know, when you needed those tickets, I got them right to you. 
[01:49:00]  You were so close to the band, you nearly scared them.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Morning, guys.  Morning, Kevin.  You guys realize that if Mackenzie had that baby with her father, she would have gave birth  to her own brother.  Yeah.  How hot is that?  What?  It's fleeky.  That's sick.  That's like some ancient fucking, like, kingdom shit.  That's royalty shit, where they would just do stuff like that.  Just to keep the bloodline going.  Keep the bloodline.  Strong bloodline.  Before you know it, you got like fucking three-headed babies with five eyes and... 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't know how to put the crown on its head anymore.  No.  Which head should we crown?  That's what I'm saying.  The big carnation.  You're like, which head do we put the crown on?  And the thing is just sitting there going, dar, dar.  Jason in Ohio.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Jason.  Just a shout out.  Mimeo Cops rule.  Yes.  Do you guys, you know what I thought they always smelled like was ice cream sandwiches?  Isn't that weird? 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Hold on.  Let me try to...  I'm thinking of that.  No, I'm not getting ice cream.  Although, I must say, one of the best smelling snacks ever was an ice cream sandwich.  The chocolatey, cookie-like, cakey outside and the vanilla ice cream inside.  Not chocolate.  Must be vanilla.  Oh, yeah.  Always vanilla.  Go to the grocery, get yourself a box of ice cream sandwiches, open them up, and smell  it. 
[01:50:30]  Smell the paper before you open it up and tell me it doesn't smell like a ditto from  a vimeograph.  How about we disagree?  I can't.  I have an aversion to ice cream sandwiches now because it was...  Ice cream sandwiches were involved in the only time my father ever physically struck  me.  So you can't eat ice cream sandwiches?  She was very, like, you know, verbally abusive, if you want to put it that way.  Yeah.  But one time he hit me.  That's when you stole the quarters. 
[01:51:00]  Actually smacked me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  I pay attention.  Yes.  I stole the quarters.  To get an ice cream sandwich because you were starving because he wasn't feeding you  properly.  Yes, thank you.  Because he was too busy doing other things.  I know this story.  He insisted that I bought model rockets with it.  Right.  Because I was into model rocketry.  Right.  And I didn't.  I bought one whole box of ice cream sandwiches.  And ate the entire box.  It was delicious.  Of course it is.  What a great fucking time that was.  You can't just have one of those.  I ate the entire box because I went to Thrifty Drug and Discount Store out there in California. 
[01:51:30]  And I went in with the quarters.  And then I just...  Anthony deserved to be hit.  Thank you.  People are saying.  So I ate the whole box of ice cream sandwiches.  And then once they found out the quarters were missing, Dad took me outside and on our  way to the stable said, did you steal Corey's quarters?  Who's Corey?  Corey was his girlfriend.  Corey Lytle.  Wife.  Yeah, Corey Lytle. 
[01:52:00]  And we were flying through the ranch.  And Corey was depressed because he was missing money and went for a little plane ride.  Yeah.  Corey was my father's girlfriend and then later the wife.  Ah.  Yeah.  Was she hot?  She was hot in her younger years.  I'll give her that.  She had naked pictures in one of the night tables.  In my father's night table and I found them.  Little naked Polaroids of when she was like in her 20s and stuff.  And yeah, yeah.  Pretty hot.  Are the kids listening right now? 
[01:52:30]  What?  You know how we like to do that bit.  But are the kids at school right now?  I don't want to talk about the bit.  Yeah, probably.  So maybe tomorrow?  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do it tomorrow.  Yeah, that bit's good.  Anyway, sorry, go ahead.  That bit is good.  Yeah, so we went for a little drive and then he said to just take the quarters.  And I was like, well, yeah.  He goes, what'd you buy with it?  I said ice cream sandwiches.  I was starving.  I was really hungry.  And he goes, no, you bought the fucking rockets with it, didn't you?  I'm like, no, I bought ice cream sandwiches.  I was starving.  I have it whack right across the face. 
[01:53:00]  Why?  And then he goes, shut up.  Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about.  That was always his thing when I would cry.  Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about.  It's like, well, you just did.  You just gave me something to cry about.  You smacked me very hard in the face.  That's what you should have said.  You just did, cocksucker.  Oh, that would have been a good one.  Then it wouldn't have been open hand.  Would have been a nice clothes fit.  Would he have punched you in the face for that?  Yeah, he probably would have punched me.  But why would he be bothered that you want to buy model rockets? 
[01:53:30]  That doesn't make sense.  That means he's got a smart kid.  Here it is.  No.  He's mad that the cores were gone.  He was mad at himself.  He was mad at himself for not feeding his kid.  You think so?  See, yeah, yeah.  He was very embarrassed, I think, with the fact that I bought a box of ice cream sandwiches  because I was starving, and he wasn't supporting his child.  So instead, if I had used the quarters to buy model rockets, then it was my fault. 
[01:54:00]  See, that's why, you know, hence the smack in the face.  And I think, honestly, he wanted to slap himself.  Ooh, someone's going to therapy.  No, I'm not.  Someone just used the shining.  I swear to God.  It is one of those things where it's like, if you can't figure that shit out.  Right, right.  Maybe he did it to himself.  Yeah, maybe he did it to himself.  You don't think your dad was a happy person?  No, no.  I think my father was very depressed.  About what?  Just, you know, depression.  Whatever makes someone depressed. 
[01:54:30]  You know, he can never fucking, hey, he can never hit that high note, Alice.  It was just one of those things.  New York, failed marriage, couldn't really fucking hold a job or anything.  He goes out to California to become a cowboy.  And he does pretty good.  Opens up a welding business kind of a thing.  And then the fucking economy turned around.  And that went down to shitter.  So he was just kind of like, eh.  Was he a smart guy?  Yeah, he was a pretty smart guy.  He was really smart with scamming.  Because I think he'd rather scam and try to figure out a way to turn a few bucks. 
[01:55:00]  He wanted to take the shortcut?  Yeah, the shortcut.  Instead of, you know, really applying.  Digging in.  And working and doing things.  What's he look like?  Is there a picture of him online?  Are you on Facebook or something?  Probably got one somewhere.  I've heard that you look exactly like your father.  Really?  Not exactly.  Well, pretty close.  He was like horseshoe balled at like 25.  Oh.  Yeah.  Someone in your family told me that you look very much like your father. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, there is a similar, there is a big similarity.  I know I got pictures at home, but, you know, online.  On my computer.  But, yeah, so now whenever I eat ice cream sandwiches.  And then I had another ice cream sandwich problem with Uncle Joe.  What did Uncle Joe do?  Well, Uncle Joe was living at our house when he was growing marijuana in the backyard.  And your mom thought it was oregano.  And he was with hippie Aunt Pat.  Sure.  Yeah.  And they lived downstairs when we were living upstairs in a rented house. 
[01:56:00]  I guess to supplement the ink, the rent and stuff like that.  And he shared our refrigerator.  He didn't have one downstairs.  So he got big ice cream sandwiches and put them in a big box and put it in the freezer.  And all of us, me, my brother and sister, just opened up the freezer and were like,  whoa.  So we just started mowing down on Uncle Joe's ice cream sandwiches.  That's what kids do, of course.  I know.  You can't have a box of ice cream sandwiches and assume the kids aren't going to get out of them.  But his reaction was so good because he went into the kitchen, and we're all sitting on 
[01:56:30]  the couch watching TV, and he goes into the kitchen, opens up the freezer, and we were  notorious for leaving empty boxes in the freezer and fridge.  Like, notorious for doing that.  Yeah, you can't throw the box out because then he's on to you.  Yeah.  You're just hoping that he forgets about it.  Exactly.  So he took the empty box out, and I hear, oh, from in the kitchen.  And then he comes out with the empty box, looks at us, and just goes, you bummers, and 
[01:57:00]  threw the box at us.  He said, you bummers, and threw the box at us.  Who said that?  My Uncle Joe.  Uncle Joe.  He was probably stoned out of his gourd, and the thought of those ice cream sandwiches  was the best thing in the world.  And when he opened the freezer and saw the box, he's just like, ah.  And then he opens, lifts up the box, and it's empty.  We were indeed bummers.  We bummed him out.  But just to hear him go, you bummers, and then threw the empty, like, fucking one ounce 
[01:57:30]  box at us.  What's worse than an empty ice cream sandwich box?  Oh, when you're stoned like that, you just want to have ice cream sandwich, and it's empty.  And he just bought it.  Oh, that was great.  That's fucking funny.  Uncle Joe.  So you're scared of ice cream sandwiches?  No, there's just not.  Would it bring back some of these memories if you had one?  When I eat ice cream sandwiches, I enjoy them thoroughly.  But I don't eat them much these days.  But I always think of those two instances.  More so the slap in the face one than the you bummers. 
[01:58:00]  You bummers.  You bummers was kind of funny.  Yeah, you got to be chuckling inside a little bit.  To this day, we still goof on Uncle Joe about that at Family Functions.  You bummers.  Did I pick anything?  What?  I don't pick my nose as much, but I got a foul odor on my index finger.  Ew.  Was I itching or anything?  I don't know.  Did you wipe your ass and miss?  Was I sitting on my finger?  Before, were you bouncing and you kept going, yay?  I don't think he did that, but that is a...  What the fuck is this from? 
[01:58:30]  Did you miss when you wiped?  I was itching behind my ear.  Let's get E-Rock in here to smell it.  Oh, what do you got fucking...  It's not as bad as what you got going, Jimmy.  But it's fucking rank.  E-Rock.  No, it's...  Honestly, it's gonna be...  No, but I mean the belly button and that.  I want to see which is worse.  No, it's gonna be a bust on the air.  It might be.  Nothing worse than when you wipe...  Where the fuck is this from?  You got your nice thing of toilet paper.  You wipe and then you just feel flesh on one finger.  And you go, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I laugh at that.  Up to the knuckle.  I laugh at that.  It's easy.  You go, oh boy, I missed.  This is the hoodie that got the shit on the seat. 
[01:59:00]  And you wash your finger and it's fine until five minutes later.  Oh, that's your shit hoodie?  This is the shit hoodie.  Shit hoodie.  I roll up the sleeve now so I don't get shit on the...  Good plan.  The cuff or whatever you want to call it.  The, uh...  What is this part of the fucking...  A cuff.  Yeah, but it's not a cuff because it's on a shirt.  A paw.  Why don't we take a fucking break?  Good story though, F.  I want an ice cream sandwich now.  God damn.  So your dad was miserable.  Yeah, he was a miserable guy.  That's why he was always looking for something, you know? 
[01:59:30]  That's why he went out to California.  That's why, you know, with the horses and...  And the ranch and then, uh, us kids being out there but still being really irresponsible.  And, I don't know, he was just never a happy guy.  And I think I saw him...  I saw him sober like once when I went out to California.  Oh, he went to the doctor and the doctor said,  Hey, your liver's going to come out your asshole.  Pretty much. 
[02:00:00]  So, uh, he was...  Have the doctor told you that?  Told him that.  Oh, him?  Yeah.  No, not me.  Not yet.  So, uh, he, um...  He had to stop drinking for like a month or something while they did some tests and everything.  So he stopped drinking.  He was drinking like this orange soda all the time.  And I think that was the only time for any length of time where I actually hung out and saw him sober.  Everywhere.  Every time I was like in the morning.  In the morning I would see him, you know, so... 
[02:00:30]  But he'd be like, uh, uh, uh, hungover, brr, brr, brr.  Right.  And then after a few beers, he was cool because he was leveled out.  But then after that, it was just drunk, drunk guy.  He didn't die from the liver though, right?  No, no, no.  The ticker?  The ticker gave out.  Yeah.  I don't remember...  Yeah.  I don't remember my mom not being on psych meds.  Really?  Don't remember anymore.  Not at all?  Not anymore.  Uh-huh.  Not anymore.  Eek.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Nice to have a good cry.  We had broken parents.  That's why I'm so fucked up now.  Because of my upbringing.  That's why I do all the bad things.  I just shut up.  Suck it up, you faggots.  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  I think Anthony has that conversation in the mirror every morning when he's brushing his teeth. 
[02:01:30]  Suck it up, faggot.  I'm crying.  I'm like Gollum.  You want to...  I'm talking to myself.  You want to have a good cry with us, Jimmy?  Yeah.  But Father was good.  He was good to us.  No, he wasn't.  He smacked you with ice cream sandwiches.  But he was good.  We had fun riding horses.  Stop crying.  But you never ate.  Stop crying, you bummers.  What are you, bummers?  Jimmy, think of something sad and get a good cry out and we'll join you.  Will you tell us what you're thinking about?  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  Give us a good upbringing.  Something that should have fucked you up as a kid.  A lot of people get fucked up by something.  But you skated right through.  There you go.  Oh, I...  All right.  I was...  My first thought was the pay difference between all of us.  I had some tears.  Now, think of something that I...  What do you mean I should have skated?  Yeah.  Is there something like that your parents did where it was like, wow, you know, that's  kind of fucked up for a parent to do? 
[02:02:30]  No.  You asshole.  I really can't think of anything my parents did.  No?  No.  There's not one instance where you as a child thought like, well, it's kind of fucked up  for a parent to do.  No?  No.  I remember being surprised.  This doesn't make me sad, though.  I remember being surprised.  I was moving my Zim Zam in the back.  What the fuck is a Zim Zam?  Oh, not Zim Zam.  It was a batter up.  It was like a big cement block.  And you had a big metal pole through it.  And a thing that...  A fake baseball on the end of it. 
[02:03:00]  You'd swing it.  And you could practice your batting swing.  Yeah.  That's how retards practice batting.  Okay.  Well, I owned one.  You owned a retard?  Yes.  I did.  I would use his tongue.  And we would do 45, 50 stamps at a time.  So I was...  My mother was helping me move it.  And we were putting it down.  And she told me to be careful because she had hurt her hand.  Oh.  And I dropped it.  And it crushed...  It crushed her finger. 
[02:03:30]  I did exactly what she just told me not to do.  And she went...  She went...  You fuck!  Oh, no way.  Mother called me a fuck.  How old were you?  At 12 or whatever.  Oh, that's terrible, though.  Your mom calling you a fuck.  I was very...  You...  You...  Fuck!  You...  Fuck!  You really said...  She said, you...  Fuck!  Holy shit, that is hysterical. 
[02:04:00]  It was not one of my finer moments.  You fuck.  How old were you?  Did you say?  12, I want to say.  Oh, that's a bad age.  Oh, wow.  You got the hormones pumping through your body.  I was more embarrassed.  Like, I wasn't mad at her.  It's...  The best part is, she could have just yelled out, fuck!  Yeah.  Like, because she was hurt.  But to say, you fuck, was like, you're the fuck, because you caused this.  Well, we both knew who the problem was.  She goes, be very careful.  I hurt my hand. 
[02:04:30]  And I just dropped it.  And it...  Fuck, her fingers swolled all up.  I can't picture that lovely woman that left you those voicemails calling you out.  You fuck.  Oh, it was her fucking...  Oh, it's that great.  It was a hurting Johnny.  Oh.  You got it.  I got to read this one.  Steve B. from Connecticut.  My mom, enraged and screaming at us from the top of the stairs, said, why did I have kids?  I could have had a Mercedes.  It was so absurd, I almost did a spit take. 
[02:05:00]  That might stick with you.  Like I said, you got to suck it up.  Let's go to Guy the Trucker.  Hello, Guy.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  All right, Guy.  Boy, I have a fucked up life.  I should be a miserable son of a bitch right now, but I'm pretty happy.  Oh, are you?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I had a mother.  I had a mother.  I had five stepdads.  Oh, what a whore.  Yeah.  They all tried to beat me one way or another to get me straightened out. 
[02:05:30]  One thought I should be left-handed when I was right-handed.  And anyway, so my mother thought she had too many kids because she married these guys and they all had stepkids.  There's like 12 of us at one time.  Fuck any of them?  Twelve.  And so she figured that if she got me adopted out to one of her friends, that would be one less she had to take care of.  Oh, really?  Well, this woman used to have two schnauzers, and she used to sit around and drink and sit on her cows and pet her dogs and piss her pants. 
[02:06:00]  And she went out one day, and she used to make me crawl under the house and put decon under the house because of the mice.  And when I wouldn't do it, she'd chase me with a cat of nine tails like a hose she had cut and sliced it, and she'd chase me around the bed.  And if I'd run away and go back to my parents, I'd tell them, hey, man, you know, you need to get me out of here.  This woman's a crazy old witch. 
[02:06:30]  And, you know, I ended up getting married.  I've been married 30-some years now, and I've got six kids, and I've raised them all.  And I think that helped me out, to tell you the truth, to go through all that shit.  That should have fucked you up pretty bad.  Of course.  Some people, like, have little things that happen, and they're like, you know.  And I remember when I was a child, I was eating cake, and my father came in and said,  Why are you eating cake?  Your hiney looks fat. 
[02:07:00]  So I just cried, and now I can't stop eating.  What the fuck?  Shut up.  I was, just had, just the difference between, you fuck, you fuck.  Hold on.  Wait, Jimmy's finding something on his phone.  Jimmy's mommy.  We were a little distracted by Jimmy trying to find something on his phone.  I love that.  We didn't give that caller proper attention, but Jimmy's finding something.  Hold on, hold on, here we go.  Hold on.  You fuck.  11.02 p.m. 
[02:07:30]  Hi, sweetheart.  This is Mom.  We just saw the Jay Leno show, and you were absolutely fantastic.  Everything was perfect.  You look great.  Is that just a mother?  Handsome.  Your clothes look great.  You're handsome.  The set.  The set.  And of course, your material was excellent.  And I liked the idea that he introduced you.  You were actually on the show.  I thought it was going to be taped, but I mean, it was just fantastic. 
[02:08:00]  It was better than we could have imagined.  It was, you have arrived, my dear.  And I love that you smiled.  We saw your beautiful keys.  You relaxed.  I can't think of it as a band.  I erased it.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Just now?  Wait, I think I should get it back.  If you hit three or something.  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  Received Monday, September 14th at 9.37 a.m. 
[02:08:30]  Wait, the Friday party.  Fuck!  You erased it.  You wanted that one.  Yeah, man.  Fuck!  Yeah, you wanted that one.  No, because I actually wanted to do something with it.  Oh, my God.  Actually, we got it.  Sort of.  Hey, wait a minute.  With us laughing.  Yeah, but is any of it...  Yeah, you might be able to get...  Could isolate Jimmy's mic?  Maybe.  We'll figure it out.  No, that was my home phone, Danny. 
[02:09:00]  That wasn't my iPhone.  Usually, if you go, once you erase it, it's just gone.  That suck.  I thought there was a way to get it back right away.  I did.  Read to play your messages.  I don't know.  Jimmy, I just want to say, you looked wonderful, you fuck.  And your teeth, when you smiled, you fuck, were fantastic.  Your material was great, you fuck.  God fucking...  How much debt do we have?  All of it.  We have the whole thing. 
[02:09:30]  And what could happen?  Could you isolate Jimmy's...  Yeah, we can just isolate Jim's mic.  Oh, shit.  So you won't hear us laughing or anything.  No, we'll hear whatever's coming out of Jim's mic.  Oh, then that's fine.  And then you can...  Yeah, they'll fix it up in...  Yeah, you didn't talk during it.  They'll fix it up in the O&A lab.  It'll be good.  We didn't really talk, right?  No.  No, it's not really.  Yeah, you might have said, like, you know, like, that's my mother, you know, this and  that.  And that'll...  Oh, what a mother I said.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  I'm just mad because I wanted that audio for something.  God damn it.  I just hit the wrong button on the iPhone. 
[02:10:00]  That's my fault, but...  Well, listen, guys.  We got a lot of people that want to cry today.  Tom in Philly.  Now you want to cry, right, Jimmy?  I'm so mad at myself.  That's all right.  It happens.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Tom.  Yeah, it was Christmas Eve one year and I was, I don't know, 12, 13 years old.  And dad got pissed off at me.  He came up around 10, 11 o'clock, pinched my tummy and called me fatty.  I brought it up a couple of years ago and everybody looked at me like I had a dick  run out of my forehead. 
[02:10:30]  It affected you so much that you remember it?  Yeah, but you know what?  He doesn't.  Of course not.  He never did such a thing.  Of course not.  It's just in passing when they do it.  But it's stuff that you stick.  Sticks with you.  How did it affect you, fatty?  I'm still fat, Jimmy.  Huh?  I'm still fat.  By the way, Iraq, what are you working on right now?  Brad and Jersey, Brad.  Never necessarily. 
[02:11:00]  The guy's just working hard on the hall and minding his own fucking business.  No, he's not.  He's doing whatever he can to make this show better.  We haven't even seen him yet today, but...  Here he is.  Here's what Iraq's doing.  He's on his back in the office with a pack of Rolos and he's naked.  And he's rubbing them the way a cat plays with an olive.  A cat plays with an olive?  I've never seen that before, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  My cat, John, loved olives.  John?  That's my cat's name.  Why did you name your cat, John?  I originally named him Susan, because I thought it was a girl. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Why not Ted?  I didn't think he was...  Meow, meow, Anthony.  Give me another olive.  People get mad because I kicked the duty out of the litter box.  I always get scattered litter all over the rung.  Holy shit, there's some great calls coming in.  Let's go to Brad in Jersey.  Brad.  Guys, thanks for letting me join the pity party.  All right.  No problem.  One morning I woke up.  I used to live with my old man, with my dad and my grandmother.  And one morning I woke up, my father was gone, and I didn't see him again for a good three years after that. 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  Just left.  Just got up and left.  It turns out he passed away a few years ago, and I found out he actually went to jail for bigamy.  Bigamy.  Ah, I had a couple of wives there, eh?  How the fuck did you juggle a couple of wives?  That is the most fucked up thing in this world.  Yeah, he never legally divorced his first wife when he married my mother.  And so, yeah, he went to jail for three years for it.  Wow.  I was in a relationship with a certain girl, woman, whatever you want to call it. 
[02:12:30]  Yes, in a relationship with a, whose father left on Christmas Day, walked out on Christmas  Day, and then proceeded to just start a brand new family from scratch.  New woman, new kids, and then didn't even acknowledge the other family existed.  Ooh, talk about toting around a steamer trunk of baggage with that one. 
[02:13:00]  Did that make Christmas fun?  Whoa!  Every fucking Christmas.  Every Christmas and Father's Day.  No, not poor Melinda, you dummy.  I decided to do something different.  I found a girl that actually has a mother and a father.  Wow, what's that like?  Why would you do that?  Holy shit.  It's kind of nice.  It's kind of nice not to have that.  I don't have a dad baggage.  Once you break the ice with the father.  I fucking went through a streak like Anthony, where it was girls without fathers. 
[02:13:30]  Daddy baggage.  Holy fuck.  And all of a sudden, you're just waking up, it's a beautiful day out, and there's complete,  it's a complete nightmare in the house, because how are you supposed to know it's the long  lost father's birthday or something?  What the fuck?  Right?  See, now, people are commenting that the only reason it works with you is because they're  younger than you.  They don't really acknowledge that, when we all get together. 
[02:14:00]  He's just, is it awkward, like when a song comes on and one of them goes, God, I remember  this from high school, and you go, yeah.  Yeah, high school.  They try to trick me, like, you remember this?  I'm like, no, not really, because you are just a few years older.  No.  Sorry.  It just works.  Big Ken rules.  Yeah, but we got some good stories here.  Okay.  Opie calls his father-in-law, kiddo.  Steve from Bayshore.  Hey, kiddo.  You give him the old, like, soft little punch on the chin when you see him. 
[02:14:30]  Hey there, kiddo.  You tussle his hair.  Let's go to Logan in Westchester.  Logan.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, man.  My favorite game as a kid, my, um, I would make my mother scream so loud her false teeth  would fly out of her mouth.  Could you imagine?  And that's.  You must be a great fuck.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, that's pretty good, though. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my Aunt Frank used to use the, uh, because, of course, the big fucking Italian, uh, family  and, and, and the kitchen had, like, these giant wooden spoon and fork crossed over, like,  the table.  Right.  You know, just in case you want to grab them off the wall and have to cook real fast.  Sure, sure.  I don't even know what the hell they were there for.  Decor.  But, um, I remember, uh, uh, uh, getting, like, a whack on the ass with the spoon.  With the big spoon, like, whoosh. 
[02:15:30]  And then for years, you'd go, I'd go over the house and be like, eh, it's the spoon.  You don't have the weapon fucking hanging there as decor.  There was a difference, though.  My, my mom hit me on the back of the fucking leg, below the fucking ass meat.  Where, like, thigh?  That's sick shit.  Yeah.  What about right in your freckle?  On the freckle.  Right on the hiney hole.  A good wooden spoon to the fanny.  Yeah.  Keeps everyone honest.  But you hit that fucking back leg, holy my God.  That's some fucking...  You'll jump up a bit.  Yeah.  That's some of that slave was trying to leave.  Holy shit. 
[02:16:00]  I hear ya.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hey, Paul.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, um, I remember a couple years ago, uh, fairly recently I had to go out and help  my mom find my dad a strip club.  So I was like a little 12-year-old kid going around a strip club finding my dad.  Yeah.  That was my friend Roy.  We walked around, had to find his father Roy and my father because, uh, uh, my mother  and, uh, Roy's wife, uh, said, where, where, uh, where the, where, where the guys? 
[02:16:30]  And we said, we'll look for him.  And we didn't know.  And they didn't know where we were going.  But we just walked around up by the town and we saw like this topless joint and we were  like laughing, like, he, he, he, let's look.  Boobies.  And, and the windows were all painted over.  They always had just a little bit where you could see.  But there were always scratches.  There was always scratches, especially the bottom, just from anything.  Beer bottles.  So you'd look in and you could kind of see, and we saw, uh, my father and Roy sitting 
[02:17:00]  at the bar, just down in fucking beers, watching the tit dancers when they were supposed to  be out shopping for a barbecue and bringing the food back.  And the wives are just sitting there like, they can't do anything.  They can't cook anything.  They're just sitting there going, where are they?  And they're down in beers in the tit bar.  You think one of them just said, Hey, let's stop off and have a quick one.  Oh yeah.  And it turned into like fucking two, at least two hours of sitting there watching strippers.  And then I think when one guy opened the door to leave, uh, I, I yelled in like, Daddy! 
[02:17:30]  And he came outside, what the fuck are you doing?  I'm trying to make, make time with this broad in here.  He goes, and I said like, Mommy, he said, you know, you, you and Roy, Roy have to come  back because you have the food.  Did he hit you?  Uh, yeah, he just punched me square in the face.  No.  He said, uh, you go back there and tell him we're on our way.  And don't tell him where we were.  Yeah, not a word of this.  Yeah.  To your mama.  Tell him we were shopping.  We're still shopping.  There's, you know, we just, we got business.  It was always some business to tend to.  I think you're lying. 
[02:18:00]  I dot lying.  Because that sounds like a happy day, sir.  No, no, no, no.  That wasn't happy.  Was your father Tom Bosley?  I didn't have a fake ID and go in there with my friends.  I think you're lying.  And then sit down and see Tom Bosley there with a client.  I think you're lying.  Where he later explained that he had to do things like that to satisfy the client.  Yeah.  And he wasn't in there being a pervert of himself.  Richie was so depressed.  Oh, he said his father was in a tit bar.  Good.  Yeah.  Be happy about it.  Exactly.  At least he's on a fucking, a booth with a hole in it.  He's at the hardware store fucking cranking huge bolts up his ass with a fucking wrench. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, this is fun.  This is a fun call right here.  Mike in Texas.  Mike.  Good evening.  Hi.  Hi, Mike.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  And, uh, I gotta tell you why.  I'm, hell, I'm scarred and I will never go home on another blind date.  Holy shit.  Uh, this girl, we're barely through appetizers.  Just having some small talk telling me that how she grew up with her grandparents, right?  She seems pretty well adjusted.  Not, not even 630 at night. 
[02:19:00]  Long night to go.  She explained that for the last 15 years, the reason she grew up with her grandparents,  because her mom walked out overnight.  Okay, that's not too bad.  Yeah, well, her mom walked out overnight because her dad's been doing 15 to who knows how long  down in Brownsville, Texas, big boy pen for molesting several neighborhood girls, including  her sister.  Wow.  Dude, I hope you ran from that date.  Dude, I was home by, I was home by 730 and out with the boys trying to drink away that experience. 
[02:19:30]  Dude, in the, in the words of one of my good friends, don't marry a face.  Oh, gotta be more than just a face.  Don't marry a face.  Some people get caught up in how beautiful the person is and ignores all the shit that's  right in front of you.  It's right there for the taking and you ignore it because she's a face.  Don't.  Be good, fellas.  Be good.  See you, man.  Oh, you can marry a beautiful girl, but you gotta make sure there's more than just a face 
[02:20:00]  happening.  Ah.  Get it?  Gotta remember that.  Actually, I'll never marry anything ever again.  Seven days.  I think you're lying.  Seven days.  I will.  I shan't.  You're lying.  I shan't marry.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Hello, Bill.  In Georgia.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hey, when I was about 13, my dad told me I was a little short, fat kid. 
[02:20:30]  My dad told me that I look like an Irish potato with two toothpicks stuck in it.  I've never forgotten that.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's going to leave a scar, right?  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I'm loading up a full trailer load of beer.  You want me to run by the house with it?  I got plenty.  A little beer run?  Yeah, I'm making a beer run here down in the making.  You need a little beer.  You got the big wedding this weekend, Ant.  Yeah.  There's even some O'Doules on here.  Jimmy can take.  I don't drink O'Doules.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  You know.  The old bastard.  Taking Opie's advice, I might marry again.  Never marry a face.  I'm going to dig up Jane Mansfield.  Oh, my God.  Which part?  Of the lower half.  You don't marry the face.  Oh.  What smells worse, her vag or Jennifer Aniston's?  Oh, my God.  That's a rough one.  At least without a head, she's not going to be talking about Brad Pitt.  Right.  That's a good point.  Right.  Linger two hours ago. 
[02:21:30]  Let's go to Kevin in New Hampshire.  Kevin.  Hey.  Good evening.  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, reminiscent to Opie's story with the beating underneath the ass cheeks where you can't  walk for six months because of the welts on your legs.  Let me tell you how that all happened and why I became a vet tech in order to atone for  my sins.  When I was very young, my brother and I had a tire swing in our front yard that the tire  rotted out of, so it was just like a big, like a hole that you put your foot in and 
[02:22:00]  swing on.  And we thought it'd be cool and cute to have my mother's cocker spaniel, ironically named  Lucky, swing in it.  Ironically named Lucky.  How cute is that?  So we're pushing the dog, trying to put his ass cheeks up on the swing, and about that  time, my dad pulled in the driveway and he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  And I turned around and let the dog go, and that dog got caught in that noose and it broke  its neck instantly. 
[02:22:30]  Jesus.  Oh, he shit, you hunted a dog?  Right in front of my mother and father.  I killed her dog.  Wow.  Now they must punish you.  That's a you fuck.  I think it was the worst beating of epic proportions, and to this day, my mother, you know, 35 years  later, will still say, you killed my dog, to bring it up in every argument.  You did.  Yeah, you kind of did.  Well, you know, I was only eight years old.  I think we have time for maybe two more, then we've got to take a break. 
[02:23:00]  Right, right.  Thank you, sir.  Nate in Tennessee.  Nate.  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, this one's real fucked up.  Whenever I was about 16, I woke up in the middle of the night, went outside to look  for my mother because I couldn't find her.  Found her out there in her nightgown.  Come to turn out, she told my father that she was raped that night.  She was trying to cover up for an affair she was having?  Yeah, yeah.  After an investigation, it turns out she was having an affair. 
[02:23:30]  Holy shit.  Having an affair.  That's it.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on.  What the hell's going on there?  I want to hear a good drunk mom story.  Yeah, let's go to there, to this one.  Kevin in Jersey.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm like eight years old.  My mom used to make me wear this super thick snowsuit.  You know, like all the kids did. 
[02:24:00]  They bundle them up at that age.  So I'm on my way home from school.  I'm laying down on the snow.  It's a great snowy day.  I'm doing the snow angel.  All's well in my world.  Suddenly, I look up and my mom's drunken face is looking down at me.  She lifts me up, just starts wailing on me, then looks at me and says, don't get any snow on your fucking snowsuit.  It's a snowsuit.  But it's a snowsuit, mommy.  But it's a snowsuit.  She went through a rough patch. 
[02:24:30]  A rough patch.  Don't they understand what this does to a kid?  I had another girlfriend.  Oh, this one was severe baggage also.  Give me a hint so I could, you know.  No, you don't really know this one.  It's going way back.  Yeah, you don't know.  Before?  Yeah, yeah.  Before?  Before the ex.  Yeah, before the wife.  She was in high school, I believe.  Not at the time we were going out.  Right.  But when she was in high school, her mother was like a raging alky. 
[02:25:00]  And she came downstairs, and her mother is on the floor of the kitchen.  But she had always passed out drunk and just laid there.  So she tries to wake her up.  She's like, Mom.  And the mother's like, all groggy and shit.  So she goes on.  She just puts a blanket on her, a little pillow under her head and stuff like that, and then goes off to school.  Uh-oh.  She comes back home.  Nothing's moved. 
[02:25:30]  She goes, hello, Mom?  Nothing.  Dead.  Dead as a doorknob.  Apparently, she not only was laying on the floor, but on the way from standing to the floor, she hit her head on the corner of the counter and bashed in her head and then hit the floor.  So she was semi-conscious.  Oh, my God.  And the kid went to school knowing that if maybe she'd have noticed, she might have been able to call the ambulance or something like that. 
[02:26:00]  She was always haunted by that guilt of just leaving her mother die on the kitchen floor.  Wow.  What a treat that was around Mother's Day and holidays like that.  Sure.  Or what a treat just any day.  Sometimes, she would just burst out crying for no reason.  And that kitchen floor was spotless, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, I'll deal with that for a little while.  Would you ever tease her if she started, like, cleaning the counter and go, hey, you missed a little brain matter?  Hey, ha, ha.  Don't slip.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, right? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, she wasn't, um, she was a little off about that situation.  We're looking for good stories.  Dad nearly beat me to death for playing with matches.  I mean, come on.  Come on, stop it.  We burnt fucking places down.  Exactly.  Mom threw a fork at me when I was eight.  Come on.  Oh, please.  Come on.  Stop.  Let's go to Phil in Minnesota.  Phil.  Phil.  Hello, Phil.  Hello.  Good morning.  Um, I was born a heroin-addicted baby, and I guess I was about a year and a half. 
[02:27:00]  My mom OD'd, and my father, the supposed father, uh, came home, found her dead, and slit his own wrist.  Wow.  And they found me in the apartment days later, crying, not knowing what to do, wandering around.  Were you eating your parents?  Were you hungry and just eating, gnawing away at your parents?  So, how has this affected you now that you're an adult?  Uh, well, I've gone through my sense of, uh, drug abuse and whatnot. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, it's still kind of haunting me.  No, negatively, how is this affected you?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Negatively?  And then it goes negatively?  Well, I guess it's just, you know, haunting that, you know, my parents, especially the supposed  father, didn't want anything to do with me.  Yeah, you're so unwanted.  Yeah, but that's all I got, I'm punching out.  Thank you, sir.  All right, buddy.  Literally?  Oh, sorry.  I guess we should take a break.  I have to piss so, my fucking, my nose hurts. 
[02:28:00]  Therapy session's over.  My mom beat me with a toy dolphin made of sand.  My mom went to jail and left me alone when I was one.  Nice.  When I was 13, my dad was so mad, he called me a cocksucker.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, cocksucker.  My mom got addicted to coke and ran off with the coke dealer.  Oh, smart.  My mom tried to cast a demon on me when I was eight.  Holy crap.  We got to take some of these when we get back, no?  We got the red-eye guys.  If they hang on the line, sure. 
[02:28:30]  The red-eye guys, the red-eye guys will fit in with this, no?  Of course, all these douchebags to stay on the line.  Yeah, we'll try to get to more of your phone calls.  But first, another installment of, what is it called again?  The manhole?  A fake channel that we would like to see here at SiriusXM.  Broad's talking about edgy stuff like we do.  Jimmy.  This is a big treat for us, I got to tell you.  The real stars of red-eye in the studio.  Andy Levy and Bill Schultz.  They left that albatross gut belt. 
[02:29:00]  Fuck that gut belt.  Fuck that gut belt guy.  His nickname in high school is albatross.  He's just a figurehead over there anyway.  But it's funny, because Greg was asking me yesterday.  I did this show last night, and Anthony's doing it tonight.  So Greg's like, dude, how's the pre-sale going for Boston?  And I'm like, it's going good for the November 28th show.  Oh, jeez.  He asked me, so I had to tell him.  Oh, my God.  It's over tonight at midnight.  Go to Walmart Theater.  No, wait, that's the wrong one.  No, it ain't.  You can't even plug right. 
[02:29:30]  Walmart Theater is a Saturday in Jersey.  Bill's coming to that one.  And Wilbur Theater is November 28th.  Wilburtheater.com.  And WT23 is the code for pre-sale tickets.  It's actually selling very well.  In fairness to Jim, Greg did ask him like five times.  It was badgering.  And he had to make sure he spelled out the websites and everything.  It was weird.  For real?  In fairness to Greg, he didn't mention it at all.  Let's get the real fairness.  Greg doesn't care about anything except a little shoebox to stand on at the table.  There's nothing little about that shoebox. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, poor bastard.  Yeah, right.  Fuck you.  We were chatting about, like, fond childhood memories before you guys came in.  But not really fond ones.  I have so many horrible memories as a kid that I should be completely fucked up.  And I know, of course, yes.  You hang out alone and you drink and answer the door with a gun strapped to you.  Don't forget the karaoke alone. 
[02:30:30]  He now sings karaoke by himself.  Yeah, he'll sing karaoke alone.  I'm testing the system.  How about you guys talk about this on Red Eye tonight?  Fuck the current events.  I sing Billy Joel's Honesty and cry to myself.  Exactly.  He's your therapist.  Naked.  Yes, nude.  Completely nude.  Yeah, we were talking about things like that.  Just, you know, things that your parents did to you that should have completely fucked you up.  Or maybe they did.  Maybe they did fuck you up.  You know, being beaten with your own toys. 
[02:31:00]  Like, the Hot Wheels track was such a great beating device for a kid.  And it came in segments.  What do you mean for a kid?  Well, to beat a kid.  Or to beat an adult or a hooker.  Whatever else you want.  You've got to keep one right next to the bed.  Andy just self-flagellates like that monk in the Da Vinci Code right before every show.  Feel some pain.  Depends on what side you use, too.  You can get the two rail strips down your back.  Well, that would leave marks.  Or that one flat little...  You're not supposed to leave marks, though. 
[02:31:30]  I just want to feel anything at this point, man.  Yeah, just anything, please.  He's a red-eyed little cutter.  And he passes out with a NyQuil bottle in his hand.  Just lonely.  And it kind of stemmed from the discussion about Mackenzie Phillips, which, wow.  Does red-eyed do anything on that?  What a revelation.  What's your angle on that whole thing?  My whole angle is awesome, awesome, and more awesome. 
[02:32:00]  Now we're learning she had an abortion, and it could have been the father.  Yeah, well, I just love the fact that she was cheating on Dad.  That was the problem.  She didn't know whether or not the four-headed baby was his.  Another relation.  My angle is, who are we to judge?  Yeah, you know.  Different strokes, right?  That's true.  That was Arnold and Willis for fucking...  This isn't Russia.  Well, the best was...  She was talking about how they were laying in bed post-coital, of course. 
[02:32:30]  And he was talking about how they should move to another country where a relationship where  they could get married would be accepted, like Fiji.  Fiji.  He suggested.  And she said, when it got romantic, that's when I realized something was wrong.  At that point, when he started lighting scented candles and stuff, she realized, this isn't  right.  The fucking thing is fun.  No, no, no.  A hard card.  But she wasn't...  Well, the thing is, she wasn't looking for a relationship.  Yeah.  When he was wiping her shit off his dick on the curtains, she had no problem with it.  But as soon as you wanted to hold hands, you're like, what, are you fucking queer? 
[02:33:00]  Peter Pop?  Dad, I know you're getting a little caught up in me and stuff, but I'd like to try out  a few uncles.  Exactly.  Thank God.  What did you do today?  We're not making this personal.  But it was supposed to be in such a drug-induced, like, fog, especially the first time, that  they just didn't know, or at least she didn't know, that that was going on.  She kind of regained consciousness.  I'm pretty sure he knew what was going on.  Yeah, yeah, he probably knew what was going on.  He's the one that shot her up in the first place. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  I know drug-induced fogs, and not once have I woken up in the loving arms of my father.  I can't say that in 100% clarity, but I'm going to go on a line.  But you know something?  As far as you know.  You seem like you really wanted to.  It would have been so nice.  Well, here's the thing.  I knew my dad was going to make it romantic.  I knew I had a time that he'd be asking.  See, I had something like that, but it was nothing weird.  I just woke up, and we apparently just fall asleep together, and I was like, that goes  off on top of me. 
[02:34:00]  I know what happened.  Just spooning does not count.  I know.  I'm like, he must be tuckered out.  He still thinks he's on a pogo stick.  There's never a guy that wakes up after a, regardless if it's a dorm party or some shit  like that, and just goes, I don't know, did I fuck her last night?  It's like, you always know.  The girls wake up and go, I don't know, they're feeling themselves, they don't know  fucking something else.  But a guy will always know that he fucked every single time.  Even if you're blackout, the smirk is still there.  Yeah, you can't fill it up with the smirk. 
[02:34:30]  You're like, all right.  If a girl likes to fuck if she sneezes and someone's clasped through and flies down on  the bed.  But that's true.  At least one.  You could piss on your friend's face and forget that when you wake up.  Yeah.  But you'll remember if you had sex.  You'll remember fucking anything.  You'll absolutely remember.  She's promoting this book, and we learned today that she's not sure if she wants to  come on the Opie and Anthony show.  How pathetic is that?  That makes us feel a little weird that she's okay.  She fucked her father.  Yeah.  An abortion because of her father, but she's not sure if the show's right for her. 
[02:35:00]  The book got these haze lists.  We'll put them together.  I don't know.  Dang.  It's unbelievable.  That was really insulting today.  Yeah.  What do you mean she's not sure?  Dad's penis in my vagina is one thing, but Opie and Anthony?  Are you talking to them?  A church?  Oh.  Didn't they do the church?  Yeah.  Daddy fucker.  Yeah.  Get your slutty ass in here.  What's wrong with you?  How great would that be?  How fucking fast would we ruin the interview?  If she walked in and we're like, hey, thanks for coming, whore. 
[02:35:30]  We really appreciate it.  You'd think she'd uncomfortably laugh at first and then realize, oh my God, what did they  just say?  No, a publicist would.  Her ass wouldn't hit the seat.  She'd turn around and march right away.  Really?  Unless her father was sitting in it nude.  Apparently.  Although, in fairness, though, what's left to talk about?  I mean, you know the good stuff.  She's going to come in and talk about the green room in one day at a time.  She's put it all on the table already.  This is great.  I don't need to buy the book.  I just opened to a random page and the first sentence I saw was, the abortion marked the 
[02:36:00]  end of the incest.  For real.  For real.  Page 191.  That's a great bumper sticker.  It usually does.  And doesn't it always?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Andrew, could you talk to me about that for me?  This is why, by the way, I'm against abortion.  Yes, yes.  I want to see what that baby looked like, yeah.  Wow, yeah, that would have been a good one.  He looked like a mama and a papa.  He had a big hole in his back.  Oh, shit.  How dare you.  That was a really insensitive saying.  I didn't forget. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I know.  You did it.  All I've heard about is this.  I saw a picture of it.  We've got a picture in front of us of Bill Schultz's back, I guess.  It's really rude.  Andy was...  And it looks like a gunshot wound.  Yeah, Andy was a celebrity.  It's not that I've seen a lot of these, but...  Much like Annie Leibovitz, Andrew Leibovitz was a celebrity photographer for that photo  you're looking at right there.  But it does not do it justice, I think.  You don't see the layers.  It looks like an oldie time they pulled out a bullet.  Yeah, right.  Like they cut an X or a rattlesnake bite.  No, it's like in the movie when the bad guy goes to the doctor who's lost his medical 
[02:37:00]  license.  He's in the basement and it's all disgusting and he's smoking a cigarette.  Yeah.  He's got the forceps and he pulls it out and then you leave the wad of cash.  It was this...  The doctor was...  It was right out of central casting, as much as I hate that cliche.  And he was like from...  He's Eastern European from like Czechoslovakiavania.  And he's just like...  The first thing I say is I went to a guy beforehand and I'm like...  And he tried to dig around there a little bit.  What was it actually?  It was an abscess over a cyst, I guess.  I don't know.  Wow.  This is why we always need to shower. 
[02:37:30]  And I was like, you know, I went to this other guy.  I'm usually pretty okay with pain, but it was just excruciating when he started digging  around there.  And he looks at me and goes, please don't say that you are good with pain.  No human being is good with pain.  Oh, and he probably knows from experience.  And then afterwards, he's like...  I was like, so how did this happen?  So I make sure it never happens again.  And he goes, how does anything happen?  Life sucks.  I can tell you.  No, no.  I wish I was tape recording this.  And then after, I have this compress on my back to keeping it from just bleeding all 
[02:38:00]  over the place.  What's his name?  I shit you not, his first name was Serge.  Oh, sorry.  I've got it written down somewhere.  I've got the compress on your back.  Yeah.  And I'm on my side and I just hear him off the side.  He goes, do you want to play with your little toy while you are on?  You want to play with your little toy?  I'm like, what?  He's like, your little toy.  You want to mess around with your little toy?  And I turn around and he's holding my BlackBerry.  And it was like his comment on technology or something.  I don't know.  But he was fantastic.  And as a result, that's why it looks the way it does. 
[02:38:30]  I saw it yesterday.  I'll be honest.  I didn't think it would be a little thing.  I was like, wow.  See you tomorrow morning.  We've got to show that.  Well, I've got an 80s surgeon.  Fucking rolling.  We've got to get this on tape.  It's whipping out Thursday now.  I'll do this.  Oh, God.  It's on the left shoulder.  Gary.  It's really gross.  Yeah.  Get close.  All you people on radio, take a look at this.  Yeah.  Well, I'll be opposed to it.  That's the good thing about the technology of the day.  I hope he has a flip cam.  And look at those abs. 
[02:39:00]  That's a svelte man.  How many nipples do you have?  Oh, shit.  A big reveal, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  I don't know what he did to me.  Are you kidding me?  I got another doctor's appointment after this.  It's like in a science fiction movie, an alien would be.  There's an egg in.  They laid an egg in there.  Yes.  And eventually, an alien is going to come out of it.  Anthony, do you want to close it up later?  Well, no.  Just turn it around a little bit.  Just turn it around a little bit.  Holy shit. 
[02:39:30]  No, come on.  What the fuck?  You don't put an X in someone.  I told you, the fuck doesn't do it justice.  What is that?  It's a...  There should be a brundle fly hair coming out of that.  Yeah, exactly.  This is another thing for John Phillips to have sex with.  What?  Oh, God damn it.  It's not fun.  Look, we wouldn't...  No one carves an X in a human like that.  I was a little put out...  It's a perfect cross, which I was upset by.  Look, we wouldn't be doing our jobs.  What can we do with that?  Fuck it.  We got to get E-Rock or somebody in here to do something. 
[02:40:00]  Would you mind, Bill?  Why?  Get infected.  Oh, yeah.  Do whatever you want with it.  It is now the property of your show.  Because Fox News won't touch it.  Shouldn't it be, like, sealed up so it doesn't...  It's going to scar like a fucking...  Well, that's the thing.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  And I don't...  Like, initially, they'll come back in a month.  I'm like, really?  I feel like that's a long time.  I'm assuming they're going to show me...  Yeah, we'll be gone.  The place will be empty.  That's exactly what happened.  Yeah, I swear to God.  I called yesterday.  I'm like, something's not right, guys.  It really hurts, and the shower was hell.  And they're like, oh, actually, Serge is on vacation for three weeks. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, good.  The day after.  It's the thing he did before vacation.  Which I'm actually happy about, because that means I can see somebody else.  No, are you sure it's not...  You sure it's not Mercer?  Where's E-Rock?  We want E-Rock.  What's Mercer?  I don't even know what that is.  Oh, boy.  I'm turning the camera off.  I don't want to be responsible.  What's Mercer?  Mercer just pretty much eats your body alive.  I actually thought that, too.  It starts as a little thing, and then it just keeps going.  No, it was just...  It was...  Like, I basically had got, I guess, drained, even though there's more in there than that.  But, I mean, he just really dug in there after he... 
[02:41:00]  Christ almighty.  By the way, I just Twittered Bill's back injury.  Yeah, maybe yours is a little...  We'll have a more high detail than the land.  Did he stop when he hit lung?  Yeah.  You can zoom in on it.  It's really bad.  It's unbelievable.  Damn.  I wish Bob Kelly was here.  Holy shit.  He'd be...  Oh, dude!  He'd be throwing up.  Yeah!  The upside is, when it comes to the ladies, it's a great conversation starter.  So, you could say, you know, yeah, shot. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Let's protect in a girl.  Yeah, exactly.  I've got to work on one of those.  Yeah, get a good story of why you were shot in the back, running away.  Yeah.  You know, the front of the shoulder would be good.  So, I face that son of a bitch, and he pulled the gun out, and...  You've got to tell people it's an exit wound.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't want to see the front.  The answer's running out of my mouth.  In my mouth.  Fucking Kennedy's fucking shoulder looked better.  Kennedy's head looked better.  Jesus Christ.  That is awful.  It's, uh... 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, my back will never be the same.  Was that, uh...  Used to be so smooth and live.  God damn.  That's like when you go to the colleges, because they have dental students there that do your teeth.  Right, right.  Because there's teeth like that.  My brother is currently making my couch smell and not paying rent.  But he painted, uh, yesterday morning when he had to pull the gauze that had started making its way inside there.  Oh, my God.  I'd, like, have something inside my mouth and just have him pull it.  Like some kind of fucking...  No, it was the urchin.  Yeah, the hole was...  It was, like, all the way in the hole.  He had to pull it out.  You have a Venus flyback. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I hope no flies meet this hole.  Oh, that would be bad.  Can we pour alcohol into it or something?  No!  What are you saying?  What happened?  Well, back, backwash.  That's, like, that could be...  Daniel keeps throwing his mouth in front of his mouth.  Yeah.  Well, we got E-Rock in studio.  Uh, Jimmy, you got any ideas?  Because I'm...  I don't have any ideas for this one.  I just want, uh...  Is it infected at all?  Could E-Rock smell it without touching it?  Does it have a fragrance to it?  It doesn't smell yet, but, again, this is only day two. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Hopefully it'll work up a nice, gangrenous funk.  Fingers crossed.  Honestly...  Great for smuggling stuff into Sirius, though.  I'll tell you that.  You don't want to fuck with...  You don't want to fuck with Mercer, though, man.  Well, I've been hearing...  I mean, just...  Mercer's an evil fucking thing.  And that's just a skin-eating thing.  Yeah, you probably just had...  But it just keeps going and going until you get the right end of my honor.  But see, this is the thing.  This didn't appear naturally on me.  Surge did this to me.  When I had it, it was like a bump.  It was a bump.  Was it a soft bump or a hard bump? 
[02:43:30]  Hard.  But it would get softer at night when I would light my scented candles.  I'd have my way.  And then if you diddled it, it would get hard.  Interesting.  I'd give it little butterfly kisses.  How that's possible, I will not get into.  Wow.  Physically, it can be done.  Don't mind me.  I'm uploading this shit right away.  That's what happens on this show.  It's like, hey, look at this.  Look at this.  And then we realize it's radio and they can't look.  So then the radio suffers because everyone's uploading. 
[02:44:00]  God forbid we describe.  Yeah, we've got to use those words.  Back in the old days of radio, we just have to actually talk and paint a picture.  Fuck it.  We've got Twitter now.  We don't have to use our words.  What do we name that shit?  What do we name it, Bill?  Hole in back.  Bill's pussy back.  I don't think he needed to make that X.  How about Lance?  Like, I'm not a certain Lance.  Yeah, Lance.  It's this weird, I'm sure it's part of this weird, freaky Eastern European religion that 
[02:44:30]  he's all about.  Yeah, like, certain straight incision and then they can open it up.  I'm pretty sure there's nothing straight about this guy.  The doctor used to work for the Stassi, the East German security agency.  And yeah, that's clearly what it is.  This is how we got the information.  So, right.  Well, that's why Andy says, everyone, no one can handle pain.  He knows.  Yeah, well, no one handles pain with you because you're using a saw.  Well, also, tell him, they didn't give you even a local anesthetic?  Are you shitting, maybe?  Well, no, the first guy didn't.  Yeah, I won't mention the name, but my general care physician is like, oh, I've always wanted 
[02:45:00]  to do one of these things.  And of course I should.  But like, and I was like, right away, yeah.  Was it Joseph with an F at the end?  Yeah.  And then the second, he gave me, he gave me anesthetic, but that, applying that was terrible.  But he didn't give me painkillers afterwards.  Is it safe?  Yeah.  Is it safe?  Well, see, now I have a new mouth for which you can do this dental stuff on.  The only thing worse than I've always wanted to do one of these is when they go, hey,  Jim, come here.  You got to see that.  Take a look at it. 
[02:45:30]  Remember that thing you heard about years ago?  Yeah, he did say, he did say, he did go, Jesus.  When he first saw it, I was like, awesome.  We're not doing it justice.  Someone's saying it's a staph infection.  Mercer starts as a bump or a boil.  That is true.  Like, yeah.  Well, they didn't discuss Mercer with you?  No.  He didn't tell me anything.  He didn't tell me when to come back.  Like, I had to make the appointment today.  So, I don't know.  Don't touch any of us, please.  This is my debut and my final opinion.  It's a hell of a way to start. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I don't know how you're going to beat this one, Bill.  That's, uh, I've got five weeks.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it says it looks like a pimple at first.  Well, I'm nervous.  This was, I mean, it was like, uh, it was like, I did have just a bundle of nerves that  was like this little, you know, didn't have to operate on.  You've always been a bundle of nerves.  Oh, you.  Oh, come on, guys.  Get over here.  Fucking make out with my back mouth.  Well, people are seeing the picture that Jimmy tweeted.  No, no.  I tweeted.  I'm sorry.  I just tweeted a close up, which I cropped.  Yeah.  I zoomed in on it. 
[02:46:30]  You can really see.  It looks like a fucking, an aerial view of a mountain, like a fucking volcano.  It's ridiculous.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  I just saw that picture.  I swear to God, I know what it is.  Yeah.  What?  It's the Xbox logo.  Do I get any money for that?  You should.  I can make a mix.  No, actually, Microsoft's going to sue the shit out of you.  Oh, yeah.  So, you're not on antibiotics or anything?  No.  I'm hoping.  You've got a shitty doctor.  Yeah.  They didn't give him pain pills.  They didn't give him antibiotics.  Hey, Dr. Steve, are you around?  Can you check my Twitter? 
[02:47:00]  Because I just Twittered a close up.  Yeah, let's get Dr. Steve on the phone.  We've got a real good doctor that will help out.  And he's got a picture of that.  Well, he's a doctor.  I mean.  You actually got Civil War treatment.  You actually got Civil War medical treatment.  You don't have to bite on a bullet.  A shot of whiskey and bite on the bullet.  I'm looking behind me.  Hey, aren't you going to clean that?  Yes.  What is that?  What is clean?  All right.  We're going to go.  There's no such thing as clean.  Everybody wants in.  Robin in the D.C.  Robin.  Yeah, I had the same thing happen to me a couple years ago. 
[02:47:30]  It started out really small.  And then eventually I just kept messing with it.  And apparently something got infected.  Yes.  I went to the doctor and it was stabbed.  Don't say the S word.  Are you still alive?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  They can treat it, Charlie.  He digged into it and drained it and then patched it up and left galls inside of it.  Well, I've always had a kinship with Rosie O'Donnell to begin with.  And now that we share staff, I feel like... 
[02:48:00]  Where'd she have staff?  I think it was on her hand or something.  Oh, her face and vag...  Her gut.  The giant one.  It takes me on your new family member, A, and Sirius, A, guys, A.  Oh, right.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I built her a studio in your house.  It's gold.  You should hear what we say about Oprah.  Another big subscription coup.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Cool.  I'm just going to sign up like crazy to hear that.  That'll bring in the listeners.  Sorry, Jim.  Got no money.  So, um...  Wait, I think you're mad.  No, I'm okay. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Hey, uh...  It looks like they were trying to get out of, like, a snake bite or something.  Yeah, where they cut the axe.  You know how the famous...  Well, the worst part is, according to him, the cyst that started all of this horribleness  is still there.  Like, they're going to have to go in there again.  So maybe that's why it's open.  I don't know.  We've gotten a cannonball out of that hole.  What kind of cyst is still there?  I don't know.  We've got to get Dr. Steve on the phone.  This is the Eastern European guy, so who knows?  Yeah.  Are you waking up, Dr. Steve?  Calling him right now.  Wow.  Can someone call Steve?  Wake up that line.  Yeah, Dr. Steve's always up listening. 
[02:49:00]  Dr. Steve.  Although, it might be his golf day.  I don't know what doctors do anymore.  I thought it was Wednesday.  Let's go to Kyle in Alabama.  Kyle?  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hang on.  Oh, no, Serge.  You told me you were out of the country.  Hey, I just want to say this is how every American operation is.  It's going to go under Obama's health care.  We might want to point out that this is pre-before that, that this happened to me, though.  And it does talk.  How did you pick the doctor, by the way? 
[02:49:30]  I didn't.  My primary care physician picked him.  He's like, oh, he's great.  And it was like in the Upper East Side, so I was like, all right, that's all right.  It's in the 70s.  But then I went in there, and it was a very small area, and like, you know, even the lobby  was sort of crappy looking.  What type of doctor was it?  Just surgeon.  The Eastern European doctor.  Well, I enjoy a little bit of everything.  He was, honestly, it sounds like I'm making him up, because his hair was short when I saw  him, but if you looked at his card, like his original photo for the Cosmo, just straight 
[02:50:00]  long hair.  Like, it was really, he was.  Like a diehard villain.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Except jet black.  Yeah.  It's like, I really wish I'd taken a picture of the guy, Serge.  Guys, very good news.  We've got a real doctor on the phone for you, Bill.  Thank you.  Dr. Steve.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Hello, boys.  Hello.  Are you awake?  Because this is very important today.  All right, good.  Did you see the picture?  I did.  Okay.  And you want to ask Bill some questions?  How long does he have? 
[02:50:30]  Hey, Steve, did you see the blown up version I sent out on the Twitter?  I saw the first one.  Okay.  That's all Dr. Steve needs.  Really, I could see enough from that.  Now, when you have a cyst like this, they can get infected or they can just sit there.  And I'm assuming that this thing got red and painful at some point, Bill.  Is that how this thing is?  Yes, it got bigger.  For a while, it was just a little cyst, and then it just got bigger and bigger, and it  was like just a poison going around my back.  What these things are, at some point, you were standing on the beach, and a supersonic 
[02:51:00]  grain of sand drove living skin cells under your skin, something like that.  You had some trauma in this area.  And the skin, you know, skin sloughs off, right?  Yes.  Well, when living skin cells get driven under the skin, there's no place for them to slough  off, so they just make a cyst under the skin.  And at some point, it'll stop growing because the pressure to stop it growing equals the  pressure of it trying to grow bigger.  But when they get infected, the pressure on the inside goes up by about 10 times, so the 
[02:51:30]  thing will start to grow.  And it's just filled with this cottage cheese protein stuff.  And it is the most unbelievably foul stuff.  I mean, I've seen a lot of things, but that's still something that can make me gag.  Doctor, if I could interrupt you for a moment here, I just want to tell all the listeners  out there, by the way, ladies, I am single.  And I could continue. 
[02:52:00]  So, Steve, what is it?  It's infected, but why is there an X in his back?  Okay, the reason is, there's two ways that you can do this.  If you just do a slice in the back like Anthony suggested earlier, then one of the problems  that can happen with that is it'll seal back over.  You want it to drain.  Right.  So you can put a pack in it, which is a real thin ribbon of iodine-coated gauze, and you  shove it in there and then pull it out a little bit at a time so that the thing will heal up 
[02:52:30]  from the bottom.  Or you can cut a big, giant egg in it, and then there's no way it can seal over.  And so your doctor is just lazy, basically.  Isn't it going to leave like a big raised scar, though?  If you look at the edges, since they're everted, you know, they stick out.  As that scar starts to heal, it'll shrink down and it should flatten out.  But you will have a little X-shaped scar back there. 
[02:53:00]  I don't mind that, necessarily, particularly since my mom's Catholic.  But, um, so essentially, I'm not going to need stitches for this?  No, in fact, if you stitched it, you would get a huge abscess underneath it.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to keep it open?  Okay.  All right, now, see, this is all the stuff I wish he'd told me, because I was freaking  out.  Uh, so, basically, I've just got to keep it clean, is what you're saying.  Absolutely.  I'm playing a game of tic-tac-toe on you.  Much like when, much like if Andy and I were ever on Fox & Friends, we've got to keep it 
[02:53:30]  clean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  How do you keep it clean, though?  I'm kidding, we would never be on Fox & Friends.  How do you keep it on his back?  How does he clean it?  Well, um, there's several ways you can do it.  Uh, are you keeping it covered?  Yes.  I mean, I have a gauze thing.  I just lifted it up so we could get that lovely shot.  Which, by the way, is oozing pretty bad.  Yeah.  Does it smell?  It's a mess back there.  We could have, uh, E-Rock smell.  Let's have you have to smell it.  I just took a really painful shower.  Lots of soap, not so much soap.  I mean...  Fuck showering for the next couple weeks.  Yeah, let me guess what we are with you.  But see, that's the thing.  I don't want it to get dirty. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, soap is good, but we usually recommend that you don't direct, uh, shower water directly  into the thing.  Why did he tell me that?  This is shower number two.  Uh, you know, there's differing opinions on it.  You know, some people say that if there's a little pocket in there, you could actually be driving  water in there, which then, uh, ends up being a good culture material.  Culture material.  His doctor said to just roll around in a puddle in the street.  Then you will know the pain.  Yes, that will work.  It will clean the wound. 
[02:54:30]  That's how we do in our country.  Yes, I was a brain surgeon in the Soviet Union.  Now I cut the X's in people's back.  We would go get to the brain through the back.  Can Iraq smell it?  He probably doesn't smell it.  Can Iraq just smell it?  Don't touch it, Iraq.  Just smell it.  Yeah, don't touch it.  A little sniff, Iraq.  See if there's any, uh...  We don't want you to die, too.  I hope they're paying you at least what I make.  Actually, I shouldn't say that.  Dr. Steve, shouldn't he be on antibiotics or something?  Yeah, what about antibiotics, Steve? 
[02:55:00]  Um, I, uh, you don't absolutely have to be on antibiotics if they felt like they got  a good drainage, but if there's still cysts in there, did I hear you say that?  Yeah, that's what he said.  He said that there was still cysts, but again, I mean, you know, he could have been talking  about Mackenzie Phillips with that accent.  They could have said, insist.  Yeah.  It seems that you come back tomorrow.  He felt something hard.  It was shoulder blade.  Well, if they, you know, if it was me, I would probably have cultured this and then 
[02:55:30]  put you on an antibiotic while I was waiting for the culture to come back, especially if  there's still a foreign body in there.  Now, you know, if you get that cyst out, send it to me.  I've got another batch of wine to make.  Also, to be fair, Bill is used to having foreign bodies inside him.  There it comes.  There it comes.  All right.  I was going to just pour the wine you gave me over this thing to help it out.  Yeah, that'll disinfect it.  Can you let Evok just smell it?  I bet it's fine.  There's no smell.  Give it a sniff, Ira.  It doesn't.  I don't think it smells. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, no.  It's only an infected open wound.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me show this.  You've got to get your nose in there.  Yeah, you're really, you can lift it up if you want.  Go for it.  Smells like zombie innards.  I don't want any part of this, by the way.  Yeah, that's okay.  You just have to be the subject.  I can give it a little smell.  The other nostril.  You're busy there, Steve?  And while you're there, could you shave off a couple hairs?  All right, here goes Iraq is now lifting the gauze.  He's making quite the face.  He's now going in for the sniff.  What's wrong, Iraq? 
[02:56:30]  What's the matter, Iraq?  What's wrong, Iraq?  Get on road.  That's pretty, yeah.  That's awful.  You want him to smell the gauze first there?  Smell the gauze.  It's certainly leaking.  It's just, I don't think it's pungently.  Smell the wound and the gauze, like right next to each other.  Andy Levy is looking anywhere but here.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really disgusting.  It's pussing.  Is that good that it's pussing or bad?  Good or bad, Dr. Steve?  Say that again?  Is it bad or good that it's pussing a little bit?  It's good that it's draining.  You definitely don't want that, you know, being trapped under the skin. 
[02:57:00]  That's what makes it bad.  Is it bad that the puss just said, feed me?  And if so, what should I feed it?  I mean, that's the kind of fun that's puss in a movie theater.  And they'll have to freeze it and drop it in the North Pole.  All right.  So I guess, like, it's not as bad as I thought.  Like, I just sort of thought he ripped me open and left me to die.  But, I mean, this is sort of how it works.  Definitely need follow-up.  And get Jimmy to give you my email, and I'll give you some information about it. 
[02:57:30]  Dr. Steve is the best.  I can't thank you enough.  This has definitely put me at ease a little more than I was yesterday.  Dr. Steve is the guy they took spider to when he got shot in the foot for not getting a drink for Pesci.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, same guy.  Well, this sort of looks like my foot at this point.  And a bullet wound, nonetheless.  I don't know where we go with this stuff.  I say we all jerk one out.  Yeah, let's just all jerk one out.  Andy Levy's getting no attention. 
[02:58:00]  Andy, you looked at something on you.  Do you have something?  Do you have a skin tag or something we could check out for you?  No, I'm clean.  All right.  Oh, wait.  I do see a haymail, guys.  Should we focus on that?  Let's get a picture.  What happened?  What's going on?  Maybe it's not a haymail.  It's just the way he cuts his nails.  I have a question.  It's completely unrelated.  Sure.  So we have this little sheet that Steve made that lists who's on Red Eye tonight.  And it says tonight's guest.  And it's got Congressman Thaddeus McCotter, Ambassador John R. Bolton. 
[02:58:30]  And it says Anthony Cumia.  And then in parentheses he put, from the Opie and Anthony show.  What an asshole.  Why would he do that?  And this is for just us.  Yeah, this is for you guys.  Just to hammer the coin hole.  We're not passing that around to other stations.  No, it's not even.  Can we bring that so we don't have to write our own?  God.  Unbelievable.  What are you guys going to be talking about on Red Eye tonight?  Qaddafi?  You can follow on the UN shit?  We did Qaddafi last night.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  Well, we don't have our story meeting until 3 o'clock.  What was your take on Qaddafi?  I didn't get to watch last night.  I thought it was the greatest speech I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  It hit everything.  And it was just...  It hit a lot of stuff you've been talking about.  No.  It's just a lot of things I think that a lot of people are thinking but aren't saying.  So I thought...  It was only rivaled by Kennedy's go-to-the-moon speech, I think.  It really was.  If Kennedy ever did a speech about how much he hates jet lag, this would be it.  Jet lag.  He's worried about jet lag. 
[02:59:30]  He's worried about the other people.  Yeah, the world's falling apart, but he's worried about jet lag.  This guy cares.  What was Jeff Felt's line about...  He had a really funny line about how you hate...  You love Obama.  You hate America.  You're obviously trying to get a lunch with Oliver Stone.  It was some really funny Oliver Stone joke.  But he listed like four things which I just destroyed.  I surgically removed all the humor from Greg's comment.  The big X over where his comedy was.  I just made it look like a boring dramatic statement.  You're holding a verbal abscess right now. 
[03:00:00]  Well, yeah, because Gaddafi had said something.  He was blaming the Israelis for JFK's death.  Well, we all know.  Well, he was Jewish.  Of course it was the Jews.  I know, but you're not supposed to say.  You know, it's called...  Dance around it a little bit.  It's called tact.  Yeah.  Do a little two-step with Israel when you're blaming them for Catholic.  Don't just throw it out there.  If you weren't, you know, Catholic with the cross or anything like that,  would they have put a Star David incision in your back?  I should have asked for that.  Then he would have just sort of bristled and just started hacking away. 
[03:00:30]  Somebody told me he would have been very angry.  It would not have gone over well.  I maintain...  That's when it gets to you.  I maintain...  The cell!  I maintain the cross is upside down, by the way.  It's hard to tell.  It's very even.  Jesus.  Again, I don't want the Xbox people calling you.  Hopefully, you'll get another abscess kind of close to that one, and then tattoo an unconscious  cartoon character.  And you won't have to do the eyes.  It'll be great.  Why is...  You gotta show this on red eye.  I don't think they would let us.  No.  That'll be disturbing to the children. 
[03:01:00]  This is, yeah.  At 3 a.m.  At 3 a.m.  It's a family show.  Actually, you should just say, keep fucking that chicken.  That's what I think.  Don't show that, but say, keep fucking that chicken.  The new phrase will be, keep fucking that backhole.  Hopefully, he'll say that next when he's on his menu pill.  Yes, Flipper Schultz.  What did he claim you was trying to say?  Keep plucking that chicken.  Is that an actual term?  Because everybody says, keep plucking that chicken. 
[03:01:30]  I think he might have...  You're not looking at comedic geniuses here, so he might have actually had it in his head  because he was doing an old Frank Perdue commercial, and then trying to just tie it up.  I think he might have wanted to say, well, you keep plucking that chicken, go to the weather.  And you know when you think you're going to say something, and the bad word comes out?  Sure.  That, yeah.  Like when you say fucking a chicken on national television?  Yeah.  Or it's like, all right, so you're at St. Pat's Cathedral.  You know, things like that. 
[03:02:00]  But the best was...  Yeah, but for the greatest.  His co-anchors, like, I've never seen cartoon bug eyes in real life like that.  I think I heard boy.  Yeah, it really was so cartoony.  This guy is such, like, a burgundy pro, though.  I've watched it, like, five times, and you're looking at him to see if there's some knowledge  in the back of his head of what just came out of his mouth.  Well, that's just it.  You don't know, because he had that sort of faraway look where either he did not know  or he absolutely didn't know.  He's just like, just pretend like you didn't know.  I think he meant to say plucking, whether that makes any sense or not. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And he might have thought he really did say plucking.  Yeah.  And then looking at the replay, he's like, oh, my God, I said fucking?  It's just like in Anchorman, when they show Ron Burgundy what he said, and he can't believe it.  Because it's like, oh, sweet Zeus.  Oh, sweet Zeus.  He has no idea that he said, you know, fuck you, San Diego.  Like a hammer of Thor.  You know what would be funny if Ernie Nass is apologizing and said that he meant to say  turkey?  Because chicken fucking is barbaric. 
[03:03:00]  And the Nazis did it.  We would never fuck a chicken on a family-friendly show like that.  I only like to fuck a turkey because that little drug gets on my dick and then it makes  my wife sleepy when she blows me.  Or you should apologize and say he meant to say stop fucking that chicken.  Yeah, exactly.  Help him out.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Keep fucking that chicken.  That's what he says.  The remix.  Do you know with four tiny little lines, you could end up with the white supremacist in  prison and not get hurt, if you know what I mean. 
[03:03:30]  By them.  Four little tiny decisions.  Jesus.  That's absolutely true.  Now, make sure they point clockwise.  Don't get that wrong like Morton Downey did.  I don't remember that.  The swap figure in his head.  He was looking in the mirror.  He said he was attacked.  Yeah, he was attacked.  He went in the mirror.  And he did it in the mirror, so he did it backwards.  He actually admitted that he did that.  Yeah, yeah.  What an embarrassing answer.  Well, I mean, two minutes after the cops figured out that, of course, that is indeed 
[03:04:00]  what he did.  Yeah, that thing did last 30 seconds.  At this conference, he was like, I came out of the bathroom.  He was trying to be all disheveled.  He was worse than a kid trying to get a day off from school.  He had the time to do a backward swastika on his head, and he couldn't cut off any of  those ugly face warts that he had all over him.  Remember how Lonnie had those ugly little things?  Well, he was going to have them cut off, but he would have bit eggses in his face.  Let me get that.  Wait a second.  Yeah, I got that. 
[03:04:30]  We would have removed these for you.  Enjoy your youth.  It's the last time no one expects anything of you.  I love Olivier's fucking friendly teenage advice.  To a man he's about to torture for stolen diamond information.  Enjoy your youth.  Oh, thank you.  What are you doing with that drill?  Yes.  As he's plugging it in, I am dyslexic.  He's washing his hands.  Something from dyslexia.  People still caught up in the cyst.  We've got to take a couple phone calls.  Now you're going to have to have that.  Oh, my God.  Listen to this.  Matt in Illinois. 
[03:05:00]  What do you got, Matt?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  Nice back home.  Ah, thank you.  Thank you.  By the way, it's Bill Schultz on Twitter.  Yes.  I wanted to tell you guys that my dad had one of these when I was a younger kid in his  back, and it was pretty disgusting.  Had to get it cut out.  Looked like about a golf ball under his skin.  And did he live is the question, of course, I'm going to go to.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's 67 years old now.  Never had a problem, but he had a gaping hole in his back for probably three months, 
[03:05:30]  that I remember.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Oh, no.  Thank God it's not beef season.  You'll be all right, Bill.  So, what's the scar look like?  Is it cool or just sort of disgusting?  It's just kind of wilted up skin.  It's a major scar, but it'll get over eventually.  You know what would be fun, though?  Take the golf ball-sized cyst, and then have him roll over on his stomach, put it on the  hole, and tee off with it.  Just make the thing fun. 
[03:06:00]  Take lemons.  Lemonade.  Lemonade.  That's what I say.  It's also sort of ceremonial.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep on, cysts.  You're like setting it free.  All right.  We got one more here from Hindu in Iowa.  Hindu.  Hey, boys.  What up?  I had one of those, and it was a bitch.  My wife took the first crack at it, and it shot up and hit the fucking ceiling.  Oh, man.  Are you sure we're talking about your cyst?  Yeah, on both sides.  She can make it happen from both sides. 
[03:06:30]  Both sides.  That sounds wonderful.  I have a little video.  It sounds very McKenzie.  She's putting in a hot pan to make silver dollar pancakes out of it.  Can we get any more disgusting?  Oh, man.  Enough about the cyst.  You can watch one being lanced.  It says World's Largest Zit.  I saw it on Facebook.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen those.  I can't watch those at all on YouTube and stuff.  People send them to me all the time.  They Twitter.  Hey, you've got to see this.  And I see the beginning of...  I see two thumbs closing in on a virtual volcano on someone's back. 
[03:07:00]  I go, click.  Unless this turns into hardcore pornography, I'm out.  I have a cyst on my back.  Yeah, Jimmy's very concerned right now.  No, not really.  I've had a couple.  It's very small ones down by where I sit in the lower back.  I've had two doctors look at them.  By the tailbone?  Yeah, both doctors.  There's nothing.  It's just like a little bit of a calcium buildup.  Ugh, ew.  I've had them since we were on NW.  I asked the doctor in Philly.  I remember.  And they said, no, it's nothing.  You can get it, but it doesn't hurt?  Yeah, well, that's exactly...  She said...  Thanks for sharing that, Jim. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Mine was a bundle of nerves.  I was gripping.  But again, she said the same thing.  She's like, I don't really need to remove it.  I was like, really?  Because it's getting bigger.  Could you?  Jim, do you have anything else you went to the doctor for that turned out to be nothing?  No more exciting stories of having this from the ER.  Remember that time you thought you were dying and it was just a cold?  That's true.  I thought I was having a heart attack and they said, that's the right side of your chest you're  grabbing, you idiot.  It's an oxygen from the Cialis.  My heart is lodged in my lawn. 
[03:08:00]  Removed.  Andy made a good point, though.  I tried to really shoehorn myself into the medical fucking drama.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And one time I thought I wasn't fine, wasn't that?  Calcium deposits, no problem at all.  Well, actually, it makes you work better.  It's like an I almost fucked a girl story.  Nobody wants to hear that shit.  What happened?  Ah, you know.  After hearing a great fuck story.  Yeah.  A guy shoots a porno and you want to go, oh, this fucking chick gave me her number one  time, but then it was wrong.  Wow, amazing. 
[03:08:30]  Well, the video's uploading.  How slow is that?  I don't know, man.  I'm kind of bummed at the connection today.  I was hoping people would see it before we left today.  Well, they're probably trying to get to it.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  I should have shut up.  You should have kept your mouth shut.  You know what this is?  My Twitter was just, boom, right up there.  I went video.  I should have went with the pic.  Dude, are you going to show me how to do the video?  I don't know how to upload video.  It's so easy.  Oh, Jimmy, what year are you in?  I'm in 1978.  Oh, I bet it's that cyst on your tailbone.  It sure is. 
[03:09:00]  You know, the one that's nothing.  Yeah.  Gets it removed.  All of a sudden, he's a technological genius.  That's what was interfering with everything.  And now I don't like trannies, either.  I get much better reception on my iPhone now.  Well, my legs wither like fucking two atrophied fucking turnip roots.  It was the only thing keeping my spine from collapsing.  I literally crapped out my vertebrae.  The only thing stopping it was that cyst. 
[03:09:30]  My fucking vertebrae is hanging out of my asshole.  Turns out those were the things keeping my penis attached.  You guys want to learn about something brand new?  I never heard this one before.  Elvin in New Jersey.  What's up, Elvin?  Good evening, guys.  Hi.  Good evening.  I recently just got over something just like that, but it's called carbuncles.  Fatty carbuncles.  I love that.  Pull the girl's womb out with a carbuncle.  Fatty carbuncle. 
[03:10:00]  Remember on Taxi when the bad review of Bobby and Bobby was referring to him as a carbuncle?  And he walked in and Jimmy asked him, hello, Mr. Carbuncle.  And he was calling him Bunky.  Taxi's the best show ever.  Mr. Carbuncle.  How do you remember that?  Bravo, guys.  A carbuncle.  You got a carbuncle, huh?  Carbuncle is like four or five multiple together.  And it blew up.  It was right by my tailbone.  Same thing as Jimmy said. 
[03:10:30]  Like right above.  Is that eligible for the cash for clunkers, the carbuncle?  I know that's a carbuncle.  That's all I got, guys.  All right.  Thanks for sharing your dumb story.  Cash for clunkers.  Carbool.  Cash for carbuncle.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Car crash.  Yeah, all right.  They can all be gems.  That does actually remind me.  The thing on Bill's back looks like one of those wounds in the movie Crash.  Not the really bad one that won the Academy Award. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  The David Cronenberg one where the people would fuck the wounds.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Keeper Sutherland.  Was it Keeper Sutherland?  Yes.  They got off from being in college.  No, it was James Spader.  It was James Spader.  And Rosanna Arquette.  The guy that I always confuse with SVU, Law and Order.  There are two actors that look exactly the same.  And one, you know who I'm talking about.  Belzer and Yafit Kodo.  No, there's a guy that kind of looks like the guy that was in Full Metal Jacket. 
[03:11:30]  There's kind of a guy that looks like Adam Baldwin.  Yes, you're right.  Adam Baldwin.  Adam, my mother.  Well, he.  No, no.  Adam Baldwin looks like the other guy.  Linderman.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  You're amongst friends.  He's a sister and he's rich.  Sister and he's rich, Ricky.  Vincent D'Onofrio.  Yeah, Vincent D'Onofrio.  There's a guy that looks kind of like Vincent D'Onofrio walking around.  Robert Shelley. 
[03:12:00]  It's the other guy.  He was the weird cook in Wet Hot American Summer.  He's been in everything.  And then there's the other guy that played.  Elias Kittaris.  Yeah, and then the guy that played Casey Jones in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  They look exactly alike.  You know, and he was the guy in Crash.  The guy that was the little ringleader that was really creepy that James Spader ended up  having sex with at the end in the car.  Oh.  You know what I'm talking about.  Don't look at me like you don't know.  I gotta see this now.  You didn't like the other Crash? 
[03:12:30]  The one that won Best Buy.  Oh, don't get Jimmy started on that movie.  Oh, don't get me started on that movie.  Why didn't you like it?  You liked that movie?  Loved it.  We talked about some of the movies.  What didn't you like about it?  And Jimmy talks about how he loves it.  Yeah, Jimmy loves that movie.  I can't understand his love of this movie.  That and American Beauty were just two of the worst.  I agree with the American Beauty.  Of noxious Hollywood movies.  Oh, everybody's racist.  We're all racist.  Look, look at us.  We're all racist.  Fuck you.  And fuck you, Norton.  I thought in a way.  I know racist.  Andy Levy is racist.  You people don't know. 
[03:13:00]  No, I'm racist, but I don't like other people being called racist.  No, I thought it justified people's at times racial dislike.  And it also painted people who politically correct movies don't paint as racist as racist, too.  It didn't just vilify the Hollywood typicals like the L.A. cop and the white people.  It showed you that Sandra Bullock was not a racist.  Which sometimes they were saying that I think that you can judge people.  Like, maybe that's not the message they were sending out, but that's what I picked up.  You're supposed to think the white people are shitty for fucking hiding because the guys are coming. 
[03:13:30]  And all of a sudden you realize they had guns and they're robbing them.  Oh, they were right to fucking prejudge them.  They're not racist.  I haven't seen it, but I agree with Jim, so he's not outnumbered.  Well, James, I disagree with you, but I will defend to the death your right people.  Don't you love that one?  That would be the first person running away.  I'll defend with my life.  You're holy shit.  Feats don't fail me now.  That's how I get the hole.  You don't want to punch the person that says that.  That's a cliche.  Oh, shut up.  The most overused, insincere, insincere cliche ever.  It should be, I may not agree with what you say, so therefore I'll fax people and try 
[03:14:00]  to have you fired.  If I ever think you're an ass.  I may not agree with what you say, but keep talking to the flower.  Andy Lee and I are going to do a fucking, a crash debate show.  No, damn.  That's right, in the men's room later, just he and I, in one stall, arguing and getting  to know each other.  I'll be covering the whole saw for in between the stalls.  There's no need to.  We just kneel.  You're going to see the old fucking, not forget it.  Oh, you were almost there.  Yeah, you were.  You stepped on the brakes.  The light was yellow.  It sure was. 
[03:14:30]  Thank God you didn't get T-boned.  Oh, someone's got to get out of here.  What?  I have to go down to one police plaza today.  I'm very busy.  Busy boy.  Yeah.  Can you say why?  Because Andy's very confused.  This is a subpoena for certain photos found on his computer.  G-glitter of Gmail.  Not my hard drive.  I had it replaced at Best Buy.  Research.  Research.  Obviously, the Geek Squad put in.  I was doing research on Pete Townsend.  Yes. 
[03:15:00]  No, I'm actually going down there for my New York City pistol permit.  Really?  Yeah.  See how this works out for Anthony.  It doesn't get possible to get one.  Yeah.  I have my New York State.  How did you manage to get one for you?  Well, the state isn't that hard.  No, but the city is almost possible.  Well, I haven't got one yet.  Thanks to our fascist mayor.  I have a bag full of information, all kinds of paperwork, pictures, fingerprints.  You know, you've got to go down there and go through all the motions.  I've retained a lawyer. 
[03:15:30]  You have to get...  This is, by the way, to exercise your second amendment right.  I have my money orders all made out for the NYPD and everything.  And then you go down there.  You give them all the forms.  They have to be...  Everything has to be in shape.  The application itself has to be typewritten.  Not printed in a printer or anything like that.  Type...  Put...  Ding!  Why?  It has to be type...  Because...  And I think it's because they kind of want to discourage anybody.  Do you think? 
[03:16:00]  The pictures I have taken yesterday.  Passport pictures.  You go to CVS or anything.  They take a passport picture.  They're two inch by two inch pictures.  They want 1.5 by 1.5 inch pictures.  You need two of them to bring down there.  Now, no one makes 1.5 inch pictures.  It's a passport picture.  So, I had to kind of back up and they took it and then I trimmed a quarter inch off each side.  So, I got my 1.5.  They're just fucking with people.  It's just everything.  And then you need affidavits of like, alright, who's going to take care of your firearms if something happens? 
[03:16:30]  That's got to be notarized.  If someone else lives in the house with you, which thank God they don't with me, you need their permission to have it.  There's another affidavit that shows that you know about the safety of guns.  Do you have abnormally smart pets who might be able to get into the gun?  Does your pet have an opposable thumb?  You're the owner of Anthony's Chimp Farm.  But it is a hell of a process. 
[03:17:00]  And don't you have to pay a shitload of money before you even get...  Yes, and if you don't get it, you don't get your money back.  You don't get your money back.  And it's hundreds of dollars.  Yes, yes.  I want to get your money back.  Hundreds of dollars to the city.  Right.  Thousands for the lawyer.  But why would you get your money back?  Because they should.  It's a processing video.  This is them trying their best to keep as many people as possible from getting a gun license in the city.  And how often do you have to renew this? 
[03:17:30]  Is this something that you have to go through?  It's only 10 minutes.  You have to go through the Senate.  How things are going, right?  It really depends with work.  More importantly, we're missing the obvious.  Yogurt speaks for all of us when he writes,  Christ, so it's going to be packing heat during the show?  You know, there's rules and regulations for this company, Opie, about firearms.  I would not be able to.  Why not?  More like guidelines, aren't they?  They're meant to be stepped over.  I'm not saying you should have me back, but I am saying there are certain things that this hole can carry. 
[03:18:00]  Shotgun.  So I got the New York State one, but you can't go into the city with a New York State license, which is the oddest thing.  So if I want to go upstate, I have to drive to the Queens border, take the gun, which I am legally able to carry at that point, put it unloaded in a locked box, put the locked box in the trunk, separate from the ammunition, drive through the five boroughs, whatever you got to do. 
[03:18:30]  And then once you exit New York City limits, you can then take it out again.  But I've found, though, if you get carjacked and you explain that you're very good about giving you a couple of minutes.  They'll say, okay, what do you need?  Do you need help with the key?  Do you need what's that?  Is the ammo up here?  I'll get it for you.  And the gold box, they're not going to help you.  They're going to fucking carjack you.  Oh, literal Jim.  Literal Jim, ladies and gentlemen.  Ruining everything.  All right.  Or making it better.  Oh, it depends on how you look at it. 
[03:19:00]  I'm getting the hell out of here with my paperwork and everything else.  Fuck, we're using your excuse to get out of here early.  Yeah, dude, I've got to go down and show.  Hey!  I was born yesterday.  Get the fuck out of town.  Have you got your Yankee tickets?  I may have got my Yankee tickets.  Can I see them?  No, you can't.  What is this, one ticket?  I have a lonely time.  Oh, I hope they're just fucking local seats.  All right.  Look up the seats.  I know where they are.  Well, where are they?  Where are they?  You're right near first base on the field level. 
[03:19:30]  Field level?  But you're at old Yankee Stadium.  Oh, really?  These seats are terrible.  They're right behind the dugout, but it's old Yankee Stadium.  Actually, I think the dugout's been bulldozed.  That's funny.  So it's just sort of a large abscess.  Oh, just me sitting there watching construction crews hitting things up.  Their tickets against the Brewers in 1991.  This is great.  My name is a young captain.  Go team.  Wonderful.  So we're wrapping up?  Let me go.  Yeah, we probably should get plugs in. 
[03:20:00]  I mean, how do we follow what Bill's got going on in his back?  I know.  You should never come back to the show.  I actually...  You should end it right here.  I know.  I know.  Because it's never going to get better than today.  Well, I've got to say, I'm very happy we talked to that Dr. Steve guy, because I just didn't  think this was right.  Well, Steve's pissed.  Oh, set your mind at ease every time.  Yeah.  And Steve's pissed off he didn't get his plug in, so it's drsteve.com.  I have, by the way, his email for you after the show.  Can we talk about how selfish Bill Schultz is, by the way?  Yes.  He goes to a doctor, has something done where you could legitimately get pain pills and share 
[03:20:30]  them with your friends.  Oh!  Doesn't even ask for pain pills.  Oh, I'm good with pain.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'm not good with pain.  Not all of us are good with pain.  We've got to help each other out, Bill.  I did not have a lot of blood in my head at the time.  You're supposed to offer those up like Tic Tacs, right?  I was not thinking.  I will get them for you.  Yes, I will.  I will get them for you.  I mean, for you, I mean, my friend, Michael Yu.  Right.  Yes.  From China.  All right, listen.  The video did upload.  It's just processing right now, so within minutes, youtube.com slash op radio, you can 
[03:21:00]  see the big hole in Bill's back.  The big...  Thank you for the hits today, Bill.  I appreciate it.  I always forget.  What's up?  What's up with your mic?  What's up with the taping?  Of Red Eye?  Yeah.  It's 8.30, but you guys are supposed to get at like 7.30, 7.35?  7.40.  What?  I think they tell me 8.  Huh?  I always get told me.  No, they don't.  They're hoping you'll be late.  You're usually in hair for like 20 minutes at least.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait.  Wait.  I am mayor of There'sville. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, God.  Wait till you see that there's a hair girl.  I don't know if she's there today.  The one last night?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  God.  She's the next level of evolution.  She's tall.  She's gigantic.  Just like a...  But she's tall, but she was such a fucking beautiful...  Not Amazon, but she was like, wait, she's like 5'10", 5'11".  I think she's over 6'.  She was fucking incredible, man.  Really?  Incredible.  Gigantic natural breasts. 
[03:22:00]  Beautiful woman.  Unbelievable.  She was such a...  She was fucking amazing.  I'd just like to say, I didn't notice this because all I see is a fellow professional  that I'm working with.  Actually, the only thing...  I don't see breasts.  I see HR.  That's all I know.  I got a reason to do red eye now.  Finally.  Exactly.  I will see you, gentlemen, later.  Looking forward to it.  Anthony will be on red eye tonight.  Yes.  Yes.  And I'll see you, Jimmy.  Bye, love.  Bye, Anthony.  And for those of you that can't see it, his backpack is adorable.  It's cute, right? 
[03:22:30]  I got my little backpack.  So we have to get...  We have to get...  Oh, no, that's your injury.  Jimmy, why don't you take care of the plugs?  People are officially watching the video, Bill.  And people are talking about this dumb two girls, one sis video that's all over the  internet.  Wait to see what we got today, motherfuckers.  We're taking that video on head to head.  Once it dries up a little bit, we can stick some stuff into it.  Can I just ask...  That's when it's going to hurt like a motherfucker, by the way.  Can I just ask, Jim, where are you going to be? 
[03:23:00]  Well...  This Saturday, I'll be at the Montclair, the Wellmont Theater in Montclair.  And Bill will actually be there.  Some guys from Red Eye are coming, so I'm very happy.  For real?  Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  Myself and our cameraman, Angry Matt, will be there as well.  What about...  Will you be in Massachusetts anytime soon?  It's funny you should ask that.  It's very odd.  I have November 28th booked in Boston at the Wilbur Theater.  And pre-sale tickets for O&A fans are on. 
[03:23:30]  I sold out three shows there last time, so this probably will sell out.  Go to Wilbur Theater, the old shitty British spelling.  T-R-E, wilburtheater.com.  And the code for tickets, WT23.  And also, look, whatever.  Go to Ticketmaster.  I'm on sale in Buffalo and...  All over the place.  And Opie, if I may, I'm going to be in New York not doing much this weekend,  but my hole will be at the Ha Ha Huts in Worcester, Massachusetts.  And yeah, show up.  What, you're really going to Worcester? 
[03:24:00]  No, my hole is, though.  I heard Boston and Worcester was the first thing that came to my head.  That's our old stomping ground.  Jim, there's no chance you'll be in Chicopee any time.  That doesn't go on sale until tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We'll do Boston first.  Yeah, we've got to do this one city at a time.  Why are you doing all these cities, Jimmy?  That's kind of weird.  Yeah, I just need to make up some money,  so I've got to go on the road every weekend for the rest of the year.  Are you all right?  To get bills paid.  You're all right, though, right?  Yeah, I feel good.  Is Leno not paying you?  Oh, no, Leno's fucking...  NBC's a great company.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're a great fucking company.  Yeah, they're good.  They're good at...  No, I know. 
[03:24:30]  They're good at that, yeah.  Are you pissed?  No, I'm just disgusted.  Fuck, so am I.  Would NBEC move your calcium deposits?  They probably would do whatever I wanted with them.  I think they would do.  Yeah, they would hire an intern to just nod off.  All right, so I guess we're back.  Monday.  Monday?  Hmm.  What?  Monday.  What about Monday?  We're back Monday.  No, we'll be here tomorrow.  She's not going to be here tomorrow?  Today's Thursday.  We like to make believe...  Oh, no.  See, Kimmy's blowing up everyone's spot.  We make believe we're here tomorrow?  We're really not.  I'm thinking today's Friday. 
[03:25:00]  Today's Friday?  I'm actually thinking today's Friday.  Oh, so then I do it?  I kind of did think it was...  Right when you said that, I'm like, oh, wait, is today Friday?  And now you just ruined the rest of my day and my whole day.  Yeah.  All right, look.  We've ran out of energy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, so...  I'm losing blood right now, guys.  It was great having you guys in, of course.  Andy, what are you promoting?  I was great to be here.  What's that?  Are you promoting your Twitter?  I follow Andy Levy on Twitter.  I do, too.  He keeps it very interesting.  Twitter.com slash Andy Levy.  Bill Schultz is on Twitter, but it's S-C-H-U-L-Z.  Yes. 
[03:25:30]  U-L-Z.  No T.  And I don't Twitter very much.  I'm terrible at it.  I got to get better.  You did say something about everyone at the U.N. should eat an auditorium full of cocks.  Yes.  I was angry.  I lived next to the U.N.  I was walking home and very angry that eight blocks around where I live was blocked.  It added 20 minutes to my walk.  I was very upset.  Well, you couldn't walk past these blocks?  I couldn't get it in my own place.  And, like, it's...  How did you get through?  What, do you have the show?  You just have to...  No, and that's the other thing.  I've got an old I.D.  And so there's guys that check in.  But even then, unless you're living on those particular blocks and I'm, like, right next 
[03:26:00]  to it, I basically had to do, like, a gigantic 10-block circle.  To be fair, he was shirtless, wandering with his back on.  Help me.  What is this?  Is there something on my back?  Is this...  Officer...  It's growing.  I just want Gaddafi to see my back.  This is a protest against the Iranian election.  We all have holes in our backs in Iran.  Fucking guys.  You guys got to come back soon, man.  Thanks for having us.  Bill Schultz and Andy Levy from Red Eye.  It's on Red Eye tonight. 
[03:26:30]  Make sure you check it out.  And Red Eye on the West Coast is on at midnight.  Perfect.  Here on the East Coast is on at three.  That's a DVR, though.  Yeah, I do.  I actually DVR every time I'm on.  Yeah, absolutely.  And midnight Eastern Standard Time in the weekends, I guess.  Oh, really?  You guys have replays?  Yeah.  On Saturday and Sunday.  They're doing fucking...  They've done 600 shows already?  No.  Fucking Fox really likes these guys, man.  It only feels like 800.  That's great.  Tell Greg to fuck off for us.  Yeah, please.  Please.  It's always great when we start the day doing that.  We'll see you guys soon.  Thanks. </pre>
