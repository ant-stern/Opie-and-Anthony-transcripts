<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton – repeatedly announcing their show's name in a characteristically bombastic manner.  Their introductions were self-deprecating and provocative, explicitly warning listeners of the show's use of profanity and sexually explicit material.  The broadcast then transitioned to a discussion of breaking news concerning Arnold Schwarzenegger's personal life, specifically focusing on his separation/divorce and the revelation of a child fathered with a member of his household staff.  The hosts' discussion was highly irreverent, punctuated by frequent interruptions, shouts of "Shut up" and "Quiet" directed at an implied "Arnie" (Schwarzenegger), and considerable mocking of the situation.  The segment ended with the three hosts laughing at Schwarzenegger's predicament.  No guests appeared during this portion of the show.
