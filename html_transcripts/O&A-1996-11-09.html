<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily promoted their upcoming WUNI TV show, promising viewers "Plenty O' Nipple" and explaining their plan to use a see-through logo to censor nudity.  This was directly referenced to their previous ban from WABU, stemming from an incident involving Beth Hart.  A Soundgarden weekend promotion dominated a portion of the show, with listeners competing to be the seventh caller to win a backpack and concert tickets.  Anthony's brother, Joe, was a guest in the studio, contributing to the broadcast and participating in a planned, humorous Frank Sinatra song parody.  The hosts also discussed other upcoming concerts, including Rush, Stone Temple Pilots, and Kiss, building anticipation for a major concert announcement scheduled for Monday.  Several prank calls were aired, with one particularly memorable segment involving a listener being instructed to sit naked (or partially naked) on a speaker to experience the vibrations.  A humorous story was shared about Opie receiving a small vibrator as a gift and the subsequent awkwardness when plumbers visited his house.  The show concluded with continued promotion of the WUNI TV show and the impending Monday concert announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And then, Immortal...  Good morning!  Good morning to ya!  Good morning, Op Op!  Feels like we were just on the radio, Gawk Gawk!  We were, I'm getting sick of looking at your face!  Trust me, the feeling is mutual, alright?  Beth Hart Band, Immortal.  I gotta mention something about Beth Hart.  What?  She was the reason we got banned from WABU with our TV show.  Everyone knows that.  Her nipple.  Her nipple, right.  Well, you know what's on this week's TV show?  Plenty O' Nipple.  Plenty O' Nipple.  And this is Hot Nipple. 
[00:00:30]  Not that flapjack-looking Beth Hart.  Put it right out of the gate today.  Dudes and girls, man, I'm telling you, you gotta check out the WAF Real Rock TV show tonight at midnight on WUNI.  Halloween party.  You were gonna see things that have never been on Boston TV before.  No, no, no.  You know, I was watching a tape of one of the shows last night.  And they're saying the Real Rock TV logo that's in the corner of the screen when you watch the TV show.  They're gonna use that to try to blank out boobs.  Dude, I saw the tape of...  It's see-through.  Right, I saw the tape of tonight's show already. 
[00:01:00]  And you can see right through the logo that we are attempting to cover up the boobs with.  One nipple than a pregnant pig.  I swear to God.  Hey, that would be a good commercial for the TV show tonight, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, it's a Soundgarden weekend.  That's a Soundgarden weekend!  Everyone else is doing a block party weekend.  We got a Soundgarden weekend.  And we're giving away these Soundgarden backpacks that are really, really cool.  I saw one in Dave's office, and he wouldn't let us have one.  No, we were trying to, you know, get one from him. 
[00:01:30]  These things are collector's items.  Big time.  There's like a Soundgarden hacky sack in there and all sorts of stuff, so...  Soundgarden bong?  Soundgarden bong!  I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  But also in there will be a pair of tickets to the show at the Gossman Center as well, so...  The sold-out show.  So this is what's going to happen.  We're going to be playing a Soundgarden song sometime this hour.  As soon as you hear that song, be the seventh caller at 931-1AF,  and you will pick up the backpack and the pair of tickets to see the boys, all right?  Easy enough.  It's Nine Inch Nails. 
[00:02:00]  This is a great song for a Saturday morning.  You've got to crank this baby up.  It's going to wake you up.  On AAF, the only station that really rocks a cool song from Deshuala.  That's Charlie Brown's parents.  It's Ophan Anthony on a Soundgarden weekend.  We're going to be playing...  I'm being Charlie Brown's parents.  Go ahead.  You can do whatever you want.  No, that was Charlie Brown's teacher.  It was any adult in Charlie Brown.  Are you sure his parents talk like that, too?  Every adult did. 
[00:02:30]  I thought it was just a teacher, man.  You see they use penis characters in the MetLife insurance commercials?  Right.  You can call them up.  Yeah, I had an accident.  What do you mean I'm screwed?  I sent in my payment.  Thank you.  Hey, a little wacky bit for a Saturday morning.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  That's a freebie.  We'll just throw it out and see what sticks against the wall.  It's too early for whistles and horns.  Oh, no. 
[00:03:00]  Gee.  Hey, it's a Soundgarden weekend.  We're going to be playing that Soundgarden song for you in just a few minutes.  And when we do, be the seventh caller at 931-1AF.  And if you are the seventh caller, you'll win the Soundgarden backpack.  That, trust me, is really, really cool.  And inside, we've got a pair of tickets to the show at the Gossman Center, okay?  And speaking of concerts, Monday afternoon...  Monday!  On our show, we got a special concert announcement.  That's right.  A very cool concert announcement.  I wish I could tell people the bands now, but they told me I would get fired if I broke 
[00:03:30]  the news early, so...  Pussy.  Oh, you want me to say it?  No.  All right.  Well, stick around for the Soundgarden, huh?  W-U-A-F, the only station that really rocks.  Reach around and big and mean.  It's the Opie and Joe show, everyone.  A rock.  You're rockin' Opie.  Now, Joe is Anthony's brother.  Where's Anthony?  Anthony's right here.  Where?  Right here.  I was in the bathroom.  Oh, okay.  Joe, cut it out. 
[00:04:00]  Come on.  It's my job.  That's Anthony's brother, Joe.  And did you bring your guitar today, dude?  Yep.  Are we going to play some songs on the show?  Yes, we are.  Rock!  We're going to do a song parody.  Are we going to do the Frank Sinatra one today?  Yeah, because it looks like Frank is ready to drop.  Soon to be chairman of the morgue.  Chairman of the morgue.  Baby.  I'll be hanging out with Dean and Sammy again.  All right, you guys want to give that a try in about 20 minutes?  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  Hey, Reach Around's going to be on the TV show tonight. 
[00:04:30]  You want to play, Opie?  He's big and wacky, too.  Speak the horn, Joe.  Let's see if he's got horn technique.  You're doing it all wrong.  That's Anthony's brother, Joe, doing the horn.  That's the hell out of me.  All right, do the wacky whistle, too.  Snapple kazoo.  No, you don't do it as good as Anthony.  No, you do that part, Joe.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, he has a practice, app-app.  Horrible. 
[00:05:00]  You are talented.  You are talented.  Hey, what do you know?  Soundgarden on the radio.  Hmm, I wonder if people know what to do right now.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  107.3 WAF with the Black Crows.  Hey, Blackberry on the only station that really rocks.  Bam, bam, bam.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Black Crows were in town last week.  You love the Black Crows.  I sure do.  Got to see them a couple different times when they were around this area. 
[00:05:30]  Now, the Kiss tickets went on sale for the Centrum.  Kiss.  Everyone's calling saying, what's going on with the Kiss tickets?  It is not sold out yet.  They have about 2,000 tickets left.  Tickets are going fast.  But if you are on the phone lines trying to get through for Kiss tickets, I would advise you, keep trying.  You never know what's going to happen, all right?  Yeah.  And don't forget, on Monday, Ant and I got our very cool concert announcement we'll do Monday afternoon for you.  It's a secret.  It is a secret.  Until Monday.  Yes. 
[00:06:00]  A lot of people around here know what it is, and I'm kind of bummed that I can't tell our faithful listeners what it is.  Until Monday.  Well, they've got to wait.  I guess it's something to look forward to, right?  Yes.  All right, cool.  STP, back on tour.  You've got to love that, huh?  Scott Whalen doing just fine.  Here's something from Core I thought you might like.  It's Sin on AF.  WAF, the only station that really rocks the Verve Pipe and Cup of Tea.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  I've got to remind people, if you're going to the Rush show tonight, make sure you're wearing your WAF t-shirt.  Yeah.  Because we're upgrading someone to the front row.  I'm going.  You're going?  Hell yeah.  Give me a great show tonight, actually.  It is.  A lot of cool shows lately in the whole area.  We had Korn last night at the Odd.  Korn.

[00:07:00]  Mm-hmm.  On the way, I think we're going to try a prank call.  Why not?  We'll try one today.  It's Saturday.  We usually do this on Saturday.  Yeah, on Saturdays, we try to get some prank calls going.  And you and your brother, your brother Joe's up from New York.  You want to, you know, do a song, maybe?  Yeah.  All right.  You want to do one on Frank Sinatra?  That's what you're thinking?  Yeah.  Well, Frank's on the cover of all the papers, man.  It doesn't look good.  He's going to be chairman of the morgue.  All right.  So you got a little song about that.  Yeah.  A little Frank song.  You know, maybe New York, New York or something. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's not going to be pretty.  All right.  Stick around for that, man.  Hello, AF.  Hello.  Hi.  Who's this?  My name's Kim.  Kim, what do you got today?  I heard that thing, that girl that won the coin tickets last night.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I was laughing all the way home, and I have to hear it again from my friend.  Well, how old are you?  I'm 27.  You're 27 years old, and you didn't mind that we degraded some chick on the air last  night? 
[00:08:00]  It wasn't degrading her.  Oh, we made her feel good.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We did make her feel good, actually.  Yeah, you guys did.  All right.  All right.  Well, this girl called up for corn tickets, and this is what we made her do.  So check it out.  All right.  Thanks.  Hey, AF.  What's up?  Hi.  I'd like to know if you've given away all the tickets for corn.  Are you possible to get any tickets?  I'm not sure.  I might have one pair of tickets to see corn tonight.  What would you do for them?  Just about anything.  Like?  What would you do?  I don't know.  Just giving something to do.  How old are you? 
[00:08:30]  Nineteen.  Nineteen.  Perfect age.  Perfect age.  Are you near your speaker?  Yeah, I am.  All right.  Can you put your speaker on the floor?  Wait just a second.  Yeah, I'm totally serious.  Don't trick me out here.  All right.  Speakers on the floor?  Yep.  Now, what are you wearing?  I'm wearing a white shirt and khakis.  All right.  Take the khakis off.  Tell me when that's done.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  What kind of panties do you have on? 
[00:09:00]  The Toya Secret Rose ones that are second-speed satin.  Okay.  Do you see the tweeter on your speaker?  Actually, the woofer.  The big one, right?  The woofer.  Let's go with the woofer today, actually.  You see the big woofer speaker?  Yep.  Okay.  Do you want to sit on that without your panties or with your panties on?  With?  Yeah, that's fine.  It'll still work.  Okay.  Now, tell us when you're sitting right over the woofer.  Right now.  Are you serious?  Yes, I am.  You got the stereo turned up nice and loud? 
[00:09:30]  It's right here.  Okay, yeah.  I hear my voice in the background.  Okay, you ready?  Yep.  Let me give her a little.  Oh, that's a good one.  I'll get that thing really vibrating. 
[00:10:00]  Does that feel good?  Yeah.  Wait, I got a better one for you.  Ready?  You're sitting right over the woofer?  Yep.  Wow.  Oh, I got something.  I got something.  All right.  How about that?  That's great.  Are you feeling anything?  A little.  This is like virtual radio, man.  We're getting you off.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  How was that for you?  It was excellent.  Wow.  That was awesome.  Oh, I'm out of breath. 
[00:11:00]  That feel good?  Yeah.  Okay.  Nice.  I don't have any corn tickets.  I'm sorry.  What?  107.3 WAAF, the only station that really rocks filter and girassetal.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out on this Soundgarden weekend.  Another chance to win in just a few minutes.  All right.  An embarrassing moment yesterday, man.  You did?  Yeah.  And it's because of one of our faithful listeners that actually sent us a gift. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, the silver bullets.  Yeah.  Somebody was very nice.  We got a lot of gifts here on the Opie and Anthony show, and we appreciate them.  It's a silver bullet we got from some girl sent it.  Yeah.  It's basically a tiny little vibrator that you stick in places.  It looks like a little silver egg.  Yeah.  And it's connected to a remote control, and it vibrates like the devil.  And I don't know where you're supposed to put it or what the hell you're supposed to do with it,  but I ain't using it.  Okay.  So I bring it home the other night after we're done here, like everything else, 
[00:12:00]  and throw it on the kitchen table with all my other junk, and I left it there.  The next day, a couple of burly plumbers come over to snake my bathtub.  I let them in, and they look at the table and then walk into the bathroom to snake the drain.  So now you're thinking that.  I'm thinking, jeez, now they see this, they think I'm sticking this thing where the sun don't shine  and having a merry little time with it and leaving it on the kitchen table.  You should have gave it to them to snake out your bathtub. 
[00:12:30]  It probably would have worked.  Yeah.  It probably would have worked.  And then I'm thinking, you know, you go through this thing where it's like, well, did they see it?  Right.  Now, if they saw it and I move it, it's going to look like, ah, see, he hit it.  He's doing something with that, and he felt he had to move it.  But if they didn't see it, now on the way out, they might see it.  Right.  So what do you do?  So I opted for the toss something on top of it thing.  Like a natural toss, like maybe you'd happen to throw your Rolling Stone magazine over it  after you read it or something. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  So I threw something in front of it kind of over it.  But I don't know.  I think they left there thinking I was some kind of wrangler.  You know what I mean?  Yes, I do.  Hey, did they have plumber butt?  I wasn't going to start looking at their butts after what they saw on the table.  Please.  Get them away from me, Artie.  You might try to do something with the snake.  That was my embarrassing moment.  That is embarrassing, man.  So they gave him the thing to snake out the damn toilet. 
[00:13:30]  It would have worked.  That thing just goes.  C-O-C.  Albatross on AF.  7.3 WAF.  The only station that really rocks.  Van Halen and me.  Wise.  Magic.  That's a WAF exclusive.  David Lee Roth on vocals.  Yeah.  Only problem is he sounds like Sammy Hagar.  He's trying to anyway.  That CD, by the way.  Van Halen's Greatest Hits Volume 1.  Yeah.  Selling like hotcakes. 
[00:14:00]  One of the hottest selling albums in the country right now.  Because of all the controversy.  That's right.  When are you going to do your song, man?  I don't know.  I want to do it like any time.  Is Joe ready?  Joe's ready to go.  Joe doesn't look ready.  If you're just tuning in, Anthony's brother Joe is here from New York.  We're going to rush tonight.  And they're going to rush tonight.  Make sure you're wearing your WAF t-shirt if you are going to rush.  Because we are upgrading someone to the front row.  But Joe brought his guitar.  Yeah.  And the big news is that Frank Sinatra, it depends on what report you want to read. 
[00:14:30]  He's either dying or going to be out of the hospital soon.  Well, to cover all the papers today, man, just to say, wow, he is in bad shape.  If you've seen him in public lately, they have a lot of footage of Frank.  And he looks like he's just blankly staring into space, man.  Yeah.  I'm the chairman of the morgue.  Wow.  Joe's playing a little...  Joe's playing Rush.  Okay.  You guys want to try this song parody?  This is completely off the cuff.  Anthony and Joe.  A little Frank Sinatra. 
[00:15:00]  A little Frank Sinatra song parody.  Okay.  Put the mic down right by the guitar.  Yeah.  Give me some guitar.  There you go.  Put it real close or it won't pick up.  You daffy bastard.  That'll work.  Yeah.  It's got to...  You sure that'll work?  It's got to be real close.  No, that'll work.  That'll work.  Okay.  Totally serious.  I'll give him some volume over here, man.  Okay.  All right.  Whenever you guys want.  It's Anthony and his brother Joe, a little Frank Sinatra parody.  The dude might be dying.  Poor guy.  Start digging the dirt. 
[00:15:30]  Start grieving today.  They're pulling a sheet over my face.  The morgue, the morgue.  This little cold room.  My skin's turning gray.  I've got a tag around my toe.  The morgue, the morgue. 
[00:16:00]  Now soon they'll put me in a hole that's six feet deep.  My blue eyes shut very tight in eternal sleep.  I have passed away wearing my toupee.  Put me where Dean and Sammy was. 
[00:16:30]  The morgue, the morgue.  My singing is through.  And my lips are blue.  I've got a death certificate.  The morgue, the morgue.  And, uh, please pardon me.  Cause there am embalming me. 
[00:17:00]  Old blue eyes in the morgue.  The morgue.  The morgue.  The morgue.  The morgue.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anthony and Joe, man.  Very good. 
[00:17:30]  107.3 WAF.  The only station that really rocks Darla Hood.  And grow your own.  It's Opie and Anthony out the door.  Gotta start our weekend.  I'm gonna rush, man.  Yeah, Anthony's going to rush.  And remember, ooh, if you're at Rush and you're wearing an AAF shirt, you might be upgraded to the front row.  We're gonna be looking for somebody with the AAF shirt on.  Now, are you gonna have the front row tickets in your hand?  Or is it another WAF staff member?  I don't know, Opie.  I don't think they'd give them to me, uh, dealing with our past performances.  I would probably scalp them. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Remember that?  So I think they'll be in the responsible hands of somebody else.  Alright, it's gotta be, actually someone that's incognito will have the tickets.  Yes.  You know, cause we want to make it fair for everyone.  We might go up to the top row of the fleet center.  We might hand them out out front.  You never know.  Maybe in the bathroom while you're taking a leak.  Hey, thanks, man.  Hey, my leg.  Yeah, but if you want in for this, you just gotta be wearing a WAF t-shirt tonight for the Rush show.  Okay?  I'm heading out.  I'm going to New York, so.  Have fun, man.  Thanks.  Hey, uh, the TV show's on tonight, too. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, it's the Halloween show.  You haven't seen it yet.  I saw an advanced copy of the show that's gonna be on tonight at midnight on WUNI.  I hear this could either be used as entertainment or evidence in a court of law, this tape.  It's really good.  Yeah.  It's really good.  And if you went to the show, make sure you're watching, because there's a lot of crowd shots,  and you'll be on TV tonight.  In two words, Kippy Love.  Kippy Love, yes.  You actually get to see Kippy Love.  In all her glory.  Live.  Like the big, burly man that she is.  And we'll be back on the radio at 3 o'clock Monday. 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  With that big concert announcement.  Look at all the things going on here at A.M.  Oh, my God.  We got a very cool concert announcement that we're doing Monday afternoon sometime, right?  Uh-huh.  Plus, we have a brand new prank call for Monday's show.  And we have the Frank Sinatra morgue song.  Yeah, so.  Stick around, have a great weekend, and we'll talk to you Monday, all right?  Later.  Coco.  Coco. </pre>
