<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about a viral video showing a man masturbating on a Philadelphia SEPTA bus, including graphic details from a caller about the man's ejaculation.  This led to a broader conversation about public indecency and the reactions of both the woman filming and the online community, particularly its appearance on WorldStarHipHop.  The show then moved on to several other news items, including the disastrous performance of a contestant on *Family Feud* (with a caller sharing a related anecdote involving a body parts question), a man's callous act of kicking a kitten (with updates on the cat's condition and the perpetrator's lack of remorse – the hosts later adopt the kitten and name him "Punty"), Michael Jordan's admission of past racism, and MSNBC's apology for an offensive Cinco de Mayo segment.  The hosts also mocked Rob Ford's disappearance and Guy Fieri's failing stand-up career, interspersed with various pop culture jokes.  A caller mentioned a base jump from the Burj Khalifa and the arrest of a Scorpion's drummer in Dubai.

The hosts then extensively ridiculed MSNBC's Thomas Roberts's apology for the Cinco de Mayo segment, contrasting it with the unapologetic stances of Joan Rivers and Ann Coulter,  and delved into speculation and jokes about Rob Ford's whereabouts and rehab status.  A caller offered kittens to Opie's son, prompting further discussion of kitten videos and a planned "kitten day."  A significant portion focused on a *Family Feud* clip featuring a contestant with large breasts, accompanied by sexually explicit commentary from the hosts. They also discussed a Seth Rogen podcast and Monica Lewinsky's attempts to rehabilitate her public image, offering crude commentary.  The segment ended with plans for an interview with Guy Fieri and further discussion of the *Family Feud* clip, along with a brief mention of Jim Norton's podcast and a Photoshop discussion involving Jim Norton and Paul McCartney.

The next segment centered around E-Rock's failed attempt to disrupt a *Fox & Friends* taping, hampered by a slow elevator. The hosts provided running commentary.  Following this, they criticized celebrity chef cooking shows, and a caller revealed another station was copying their "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment.  E-Rock later reappeared, having unexpectedly smashed a cake intended for *Fox & Friends* (taken from Elizabeth Hasselbeck) into his own face during a commercial break, prompting much laughter and the viewing of photos and video of the incident.

Guy Fieri then joined the show in studio, discussing his new Vegas restaurant, "Guy's Vegas," and his cookbook, "Guy on Fire."  The conversation included detailed discussion of the cake incident with E-Rock and Hasselbeck, Fieri's son's upcoming 18th birthday and prom, anecdotes from his life, and his relationship with Anthony Bourdain.  They also discussed Fieri's show, *Triple D*, and the hosts' failed attempts to be guests.  The hosts then shared their experiences with celebrities who didn't acknowledge them.   Adam from TMZ and Jenny, a radio host, also appeared as guests.  Patrice O'Neal joined later in the show, along with a final discussion about an ASPCA commercial featuring Sarah McLachlan (with a Patrice O'Neal bit), the Jim Norton Photoshop issue, and the hosts' upcoming live performances.  Lady Di, a regular caller, also called in and revealed she had urinated on herself, leading to the hosts’ harsh criticism.  Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity and sexually suggestive language were frequently used.

[00:03:00]  that he's touching himself and exposing himself it's on video it's on my phone  you really want to do that i have it on my phone  she english huh are you crazy do you see how many people are on this bus do you see a child  behind you you are disgusting 
[00:03:30]  is he still doing it yeah oh yeah it won't stop at least pinching the helmet  yes i am  like i'm standing here i'm standing here the whole time like why wouldn't you just say something like 
[00:04:00]  you just need to get out of my way and move or something like that i did i said can work as soon  as you pulled it out you didn't don't like that you didn't say  does someone need to tell you not to touch yourself in public on a bus  good for her  does someone actually need to tell you that you don't know that  are you kidding me  you need to get off that bus now  he just thinks he should be just jack off on the bus like are you kidding me you didn't say anything 
[00:04:30]  it's like my you didn't say my music was too loud right right down you know he was in a trance i guess  what freaked him out other people started yelling at him i think what freaked him out was the fact  that she said there's a child behind you oh and then um i think maybe the parent came or i think the  parent of the child said something the audio is pretty tough too i'm gonna go off someone said i'm  about to go off and i think the mother stood up behind him and said something said something  oh that's great i'll get his ass handed to him if he waits there too long this reminds me like 
[00:05:00]  chapelle years ago had a bit about a guy pulling his dick out in public yeah and the and the like  the thing is the problem is no one ever says anything to him yeah yeah yeah ignore it he goes  but like no one ever just goes hey man what are you i'm with my family and because the guy would  probably be like oh sorry oh fuck  i mean the child angle is bad obviously that's  but if i'm on that bus and it's all adults and some dude is jerking off i'm laughing my ass off  i'm laughing my ass off i'm not bothered by it at all well she was cool about it too she wasn't 
[00:05:30]  freaked out she was grossed out she wasn't you she was going for her everyone's going for their  video come on you think at this point everyone's going for their video yeah absolutely that's what  they say she has a shitty phone so she blew it if you you're supposed to yell at those guys and  they're supposed to stop right like even the subway rubbers like the guys who just rub their  boners on women in the subway he scold them apparently they stop because it's all like this 
[00:06:00]  fantasy that the woman likes it right right right if she shows she doesn't like it then it wrecks the  whole thing oh damn now i'm just creep now i'm just a creepy guy you gotta know how to do that  properly that's all when you come into a subway stop that's when you kind of because the the train  will take care of that for you what is it about just a quick fuck you know what i'm saying yeah  sam got it all of a sudden you know that they they apply the brakes and it pushes everyone forward  oops at this point in my life i want to finish i don't want to sit there and get a couple little 
[00:06:30]  like rubs on something go oh that was great no i'm gonna lay down and fucking calm and go to sleep  when a guy pulls his dick out like that there's a part of us that goes he's repulsive  and the other part that admires his moral courage his gumption his stick to it god i wish i had the  guts to do that he has moxie that's what i want to do i want to jerk off all over the place  then he finally comes out of the trance and is like what the fuck why didn't you tell me  and she was telling him the whole time i'm filming him why they blur out the dick i must have come from 
[00:07:00]  a news uh it looked like the background it came from some news right that's no fucking like primitive  thing to do just sit there and fucking like a monkey you're just jacking off yeah go to the  zoo what are they doing jacking off doing some of that jack just jacking staring at people  and he wasn't so he wasn't deterred by her saying anything that would usually freak a guy out where  he'd put his dick away and go it's almost like he didn't understand what she was saying and why he 
[00:07:30]  she was so angry have humans become too civilized ah aren't we supposed to be jacking off we're  supposed to be jacking off just throw away all these years of real civilization right right back  to basics i'm just asking right as a human being aren't you supposed to just jack off once you have  the technology to move you from point a to point b you shouldn't jerk off on that technology  so the monkeys in the zoo right they're allowed to do that still until they have some kind of  transportation i think as early exactly i think as early as the uh travoy that the indians used to 
[00:08:00]  use people stopped jerking off on it nah right because it was transporting you somewhere jimmy's  absolutely right and i bet there are female monkeys they go knock that off you think female monkeys like  yeah they just make noise and then just throw shit at that monkey that's jerking off jerking off  they handle it more honestly they throw shit at your face that would stop people probably faster if  someone threw shit at your face oh yeah that's a censored video we'll go to mike in a second but

[00:34:00]  that's bigger  that's bigger  than it was  when you were 16  your penis  that would be a question  and steve's yucking it up  but he just  steve harvey just understands  that there's a great laugh there  and i feel like  in the platform  all right  wouldn't it be great  if he penalized it for that  and gave it no points  yeah  clock is ticking 
[00:34:30]  can you pause for a second  yeah  but they had to know that  that is  of course  yeah  so he's setting up his own  fucking punchline  exactly  they didn't use to like  put automatic jokes  in the uh  right  yeah  it's cause the host was making out  with all the contestants  yeah  hello love  come here  give us a kiss love  give us a kiss love  a dumb little  lean in he would do  they knew someone would say penis 
[00:35:00]  to that question  yeah  and it would get a great laugh  steve harvey could do his thing  what's delicious to eat  it's the answer for so many questions  what's fun to find on your seat by accident  what do you hate to have in your ear in the morning  what's the worst thing you've ever had thrown in your eye  oh boy  what do they think they just restarted it  what'd be funny if she said cock  cock  cock  cock  cock  cock

[00:36:30]  that wasn't improv  that was all ready to go in his head  he knew  the whole thing was a setup  no  what she said  so he can  go with his go go to material  yeah  still funny  i mean  how'd she do  she  we really are hens  did she win the money  didn't she win the money  did she get it i hope so  i'm curious too if she won  i sure hope so  wouldn't it be great if when you when you when you finally saw it from their point of view  there's men pointing rifles at them as they read these questions 
[00:37:00]  that would be a great one  steve martin had a great joke on snl in the seventies he was hosting and his thing was what i believe  did you ever see that  no no  it was a poem with music behind it  i believe it was like all this dumb shit  now it's ringing a bell  one of them was i believe the family feud should be fought with guns  that was a very funny bit 
[00:37:30]  with that why don't we take a break  i saw food  is the food here  penis  yeah on the first philly video you saw food  how many points  zero points for penis  what  how is it  maybe because it doesn't grow up to 16  how is that no points  that's stupid  people would say penis  of course they would  mine's a lot bigger now than it was when i was 16  whoa  i had a big growth spurt  mine was the same  mine was the same size when i was three  that's when i was 37  and then one day i just had a growth spurt  i said my prayers

[00:39:30]  we'll take a break and do some things  we gotta talk about rob ford he's missing  and the msabc apology  and guy fieri  oh yeah  so we got a uh action packed show for ya  opium  can't explain  i'm feeling sad  can't explain  certain kind  can't explain  i feel like cold 
[00:40:00]  can't explain  get down my soul  yeah  can't explain  tamzin  Townsend, 11 years ago today, the child porn thing went away.  Damn.  We saw that video recently on our show.  Yeah.  Of him being questioned.  He looked old there.  At the station house.  Jesus.  That was a very sad video to watch, really.  Yeah, it was.  So, in other music news, Steve Perry left Journey 16 years ago today. 
[00:40:30]  Holy shit.  16 years ago.  Wow.  And then the other shit.  Doesn't matter, really.  I'm starting to see it your way a little bit.  Yeah, come on.  But the hitch.  Boink.  Boink.  I don't care.  That's good stuff.  We should just ask.  No, no, no.  Can't we just ask?  I'm not asking anything.  Why?  I don't know.  Why not? 
[00:41:00]  HR.  I don't know.  Oh, good point, Smith.  HR.  Puffin' stuff.  I got it.  Look, the song is perfect.  I can't explain.  Because people say, what are you talking about?  I can't explain.  I can't explain.  I can't explain.  You're missing a Who song, Jimmy.  I know you love the Who.  Who, Who.  One of my favorites.  Who, Who.  Who, Who.  I know you're going to walk at that.  That's very, uh, crazy. 
[00:41:30]  Where's the cat update?  Travis, is it in our pile?  Oh, mama, a cat.  Cat update right here.  Mm.  No, that's like all the words.  Yeah.  Words.  The guy came home, the cat's alive.  Travis makes it easy.  So he takes all the words, and then he highlights the more important words.  The important of the words.  Shelter rescuers catch accused Brooklyn cat kicker Andre Robinson's feline victim.  Oh.  The cat is in the bag.  Ah. 
[00:42:00]  Weird news.  This might be weird news.  Oh, no.  You think it's weird news?  Yeah, let's go with weird news on this one, please.  Oh, no.  I don't want to hear it.  Thank you, Squatch.  But it's underage stories that are very strange.  Weird news.  Weird.  The cat in a kitty story.  The cat's in the bag.  The cat's in the bag.  And the pussy is hiding out with his mom.  It's pretty funny.  Pretty funny.  1980.  Funny stuff.  Yeah, you know, we were a kid, we know he played kick the camera, not with a cat. 
[00:42:30]  Not with a cat.  Not with a cat.  It goes nowhere.  The greatest set of stories that go absolutely nowhere.  Nowhere.  Dude, you'd walk into a bar and are they thirsty?  I don't know the circumstances.  Weird news.  Thirsty.  Oh.  It took 16 rescuers.  Wow.  And several hours of chasing.  To capture the stray cat that managed to survive being kicked like a football by a Brooklyn punk.  A vicious attack that was captured on video. 
[00:43:00]  What's up?  I'm just asking him to find something.  Oh.  I thought it was some show-worthy.  But so far, the only price accused kitty kicker Andre Robinson has paid for launching  an innocent animal into the stratosphere has been a night in jail.  We said this yesterday that he's going to get nothing.  And he's loving the attention.  Hmm.  He's not scared.  I'm sure he's getting a lot of hate his way, but he's not scared of any of that shit.  Show them punk-ass motherfuckers. 
[00:43:30]  A small-time punk with eight prior arrests, including one for a knife point robbery in 2011.  Robinson was released Tuesday on no bond after he was charged with aggravated animal cruelty.  He didn't even have to pay.  In the end, there's really not much you could do with a person that kicks a kitten or a cat.  Nope.  The cat is fine.  I told you all, the cat is fine.  His mom, Mary Kirby, barked after she returned to the bravoot houses.  Uh-oh. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Sounds fancy.  The houses.  With her sullen 21-year-old son.  There's nothing wrong with that cat!  What?  So?  Not because of anything he did, that's for sure.  Right.  The gray and white kitty was being checked out for injuries at an ASPCA hospital in Manhattan.  If any are found, the charges against Robinson could be up to a felony, sources said.  I think it's fine.  I think it's going to be fine.  That's one of those fucking ghetto project houses cats. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  That's probably one of the nasty-ass fucking cats.  Now, I know most of us love cats, and all of us love kittens.  Most love cats.  Uh-huh.  All love kittens.  Everyone loves a kitten.  Um, you know there's going to be some dummy that says, I am going to rescue this cat.  Oh, boy.  And they are going to have a nightmare on their heads.  Are they in for a time?  Oh, boy, are they.  You know, it just needs some love.  Right.  It just needs a little shookah under the chin, because it's been so...  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Get it off of me! 
[00:45:00]  Get it off, you son of a bitch!  You don't think the cat would respond well to their little...  No, no, no!  That's one of those that'll dig its claws into your leg and just sit there with insane  face.  Right.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  And it just won't let go.  That cat is going to be someone's nightmare.  Because you know all those people are out there.  They've got to save everything.  Yeah.  Man, I don't know.  I would leave this one alone.  It seems like that cat's been outside a little too long. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And something tells me it might not be the first time that cat's been kicked.  Kicked?  I bet.  I bet that's got some fucking...  Lots of Jordan marks on it.  The mom, man.  She's being a bit aggressive on this whole thing.  Of course.  Because they arrested her son.  Well...  Let's see.  Anything you want to ask me or my son, you have to ask his lawyer!  He's got a lawyer.  He's all lawyered up.  So...  Mm-hmm.  Kirby yelled as Robinson cowered in the shadows. 
[00:46:00]  Sam, motherfucker!  Robinson was wearing the same sneakers he wore when he kicked the cat when he showed up Tuesday morning in court.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Famous sneakers.  He admitted that he place-kicked the pussycat?  Ah, pulls it up.  Uh...  As it was...  Okay.  Now it's all the words we don't need.  Words.  So they took the cat.  Yeah.  They bring him to, like, some fucking little place.  They check him out.  And then they, uh...  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:30]  Put him out there to the public.  It's gonna be like that cat that Travis fucking tried to adopt.  Travis tried to adopt the cat.  He tried to do the right thing.  And what happened, Travis?  Little Riley came over the house and just loved little Beavis.  And she has a little stuffed kitty and everything.  And it's adorable.  And then Travis was like, you know, I'm gonna do the right thing here and get his little daughter a little kitty.  Sure.  So he...  That cat was out the door in 24 hours. 
[00:47:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I think we've...  Even though, like, it's really expensive and we don't have the money to do it, we just have to get a kitten.  You really have to.  It's so bad because it's like, so many animals need to be adapted.  It's like, you know what?  It's true.  But you can't just say to people...  And this is...  I got this a lot because I bought a kitten.  Right.  And they're like, you have to adopt...  Some people are not cut out to adopt an animal that already has fucking issues.  You know?  I know what's gonna happen. 
[00:47:30]  What?  Howard, we gotta save that cat!  We adopted the kitten, the cat, from the projects that got kicked.  Beth went down there, picked it up, and it's at my house now.  Hoo-hoo.  Ha-ha-ha!  That'd be hilarious!  Look, man.  That guy's in cat hell.  He comes in all scratched up.  Who's he kidding?  He's in cat hell.  He has gotta be in cat hell.  We've rescued another 20 animals. 
[00:48:00]  Here's a picture of Howie with...  And then just fucking name 20 more animals.  Right.  They're gonna have to euthanize that cat, Boris and Staten Island are saying.  I don't know.  I think someone...  I don't think they euthanized that cat.  You know what, Boris?  You're an idiot.  Hold on.  I gotta tell him to his face.  It's too famous.  They're not gonna euthanize it.  Thank you.  Boris, you're dumb.  Thank you.  I'll see you later.  Yeah, bye.  Had to say it to his face. 
[00:48:30]  He didn't know how to play with a weird noob.  That's the proper way to hate.  Yes.  That's it.  Not from your basement, from a fake account.  You do it right to the person's face.  Right.  You're right, though.  This cat is so famous, they have to make sure it lives.  It lives.  And someone will adopt this cat.  Some ghetto fucking kick cat.  It's the kick cat ghetto fucking housing project cat.  You think it's gonna be one of those cats where the ears are like just pushed away  the fuck back. 
[00:49:00]  Just flat fucking ears.  Tail like a fucking feather duster.  We adopted the cat and we're gonna name him Punty.  Punty.  So I was playing with little Punty last night.  Playing with little Punty.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  I love it. 
[00:49:30]  I love that we get to tell the people the news before it happens.  Yeah.  This cat will be adopted by Friday.  No problem.  Hell yeah.  It has to be adopted.  And it will be a nightmare.  It has to be adopted.  Whoa.  So.  How much is a kitten there, Travis?  I mean, you gotta pay for the kitten, then you gotta pay to get it, like, declawed.  No.  No, that's what we would do.  Don't declaw the kitty.  All my cats have always been declawed.  Oh, you're so cruel.  Dog that I'm not going to put in harm's way.  Prepare for all the fucking, uh, texts, uh, tweets, fucking shit about what a cruel man you are. 
[00:50:00]  He's right.  You gotta declaw it.  It's either that or let it die.  I clip little Beavis's nails.  Oh, you don't declaw them?  I have the clipper, and every so often I go, come here, Beav.  And we sit on the couch, and I go, clip his little nails.  Is he cool with it?  Yeah, Beavis cool with everything.  Why do they say don't declaw the cat?  Well, because if it's an outdoor cat, he's out there.  No, it's, uh, I... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, indoors, a lot of people.  I believe it's very painful for the little guy.  It's, and it's like, their nails aren't just those nails that you see.  There's a whole, like, hinged device thing that, you know, how their nails pop out.  So all that's gotta be, it's almost like removing your fingers up to the first knuckle.  Wow, really?  You know, yeah, I don't know.  And, and you're, and Beavis goes outside enough where he, he needs his claws.  Uh, well, he doesn't really go out that much.  Oh, you don't.  I thought you were starting to come in.  I let him out a little bit, but I gotta put a little skirt around a tree that he likes 
[00:51:00]  to climb, so I gotta get some chicken wire and make a, not me, Pete, Pete'll do it.  And I, I, I put around the tree so he can't get above that point on that one tree, because  that's the only one he can really climb up and, you know, get to wires.  You don't want your cat to get stuck in a tree, you have to call the fire department.  The fire department, help, help!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But you have to buy a fucking kitten.  Yeah, and, and, you know.  How much, how much are you thinking?  How much am I thinking?  Yeah.  I have no idea. 
[00:51:30]  And I just moved, so I'm really not in the position to buy a cat.  Oh, buy a cat for the kid.  The poor kid's crying.  Buy the cat.  He'll run you a G for everything.  So, you know.  About.  It'll be a while.  And then, uh.  You can't just keep taking cats in and then bringing them back the next day.  Sure you can.  Just say why.  This one's ugly.  This one's ugly.  I don't like it.  Maybe you brought your cat back and they said, what's wrong?  His dick's not big enough.  When are you going to come, I have something for Travis.  I have a subwoofer.  Speaking.  And, um, a, uh, a little sound bar I'm giving him. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, okay, cool.  Oh, nice.  That's right.  He's going to have to earn it, too.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Do you have a ride?  A rod?  Hmm?  It's too big to carry.  I know.  Okay.  Yeah.  These fucking allergies, man.  I think I got them, too.  What the fuck?  Oh, God.  My throat's scratchy.  My nose is redny.  It's ridiculous.  I'm doing the gulp, gulp, gulp.  You just got a fucking snot in the back of your throat.  Oh, my God.  It's just, my eyes are just. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  It's all hell.  My nostril's flaring or whatever.  It's just like.  Oh.  What is that?  It's just like.  Oh, no.  It sounds freakish.  Oh.  Whatever.  War.  So, you want to do the apology?  I love a good apology.  Sam, I think we need some apology production.  Because this apology thing is not going away anytime soon.  Hell no.  We start a thing in our show.  Basically, we're trying to go 10 lousy days without somebody apologizing for something on the news and in the media. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Do we have more than one today?  I feel like there was another one.  Well, MSNBC is a groveling network.  I've never seen a bigger collective group of grovelers in MSNBC.  Right.  They're the worst.  They will jump to an apology.  Oh, sorry.  So sorry.  So quickly.  Holy shit.  Before even trying to explain anything.  So, what?  It's the pre-show to The Morning Joe?  Yeah.  Way too early.  Yeah.  We used to watch Way Too Early a little bit when Willie Geist was the host. 
[00:53:30]  He was really good at it.  What are we?  How are we with Willie Geist these days?  Are we friends?  That's my boy.  I like the guy.  I was just so frustrated by the whole Joan Rivers thing.  Oh, right.  That's what it was.  Because they're grooming him to be the main guy, I think, on the Today Show.  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  And, you know, he usually steps out.  Yeah.  He steps out and he takes, you know, chances, unlike the rest of his colleagues. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  And it seems like they're starting to shape him into that same fucking mold.  And I'd, whatever, he'll make millions of dollars, so he doesn't need my stupid advice.  But he knew Joan Rivers was joking that day.  She was only joking?  You know, he had to read the apology from the network.  They apologized for her.  It's just, oh, God.  Someone bothered me a lot.  But, anyway.  Now, but here's the thing with MSNBC.  They had to apologize for this Cinco de Mayo thing.  In what faraway galaxy did they think that in this day and age it was going to be okay for a guy to put on a sombrero and march in front of the camera shot drinking tequila on Cinco de Mayo? 
[00:54:30]  Well, they thought so stupidly.  They were making fun of the way people celebrate this.  Right.  So they thought, well, the context would be obvious, not realizing that scumbags like them are the biggest purposeful, take-things-out-of-context offenders. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  So now they get it back in their face.  So they get some Mexican guy.  Yeah, they just suck at doing bits.  Right.  Because the fact is, Cinco de Mayo, I don't know anything about it, but I did a lot of walking on Cinco de Mayo, what was it, Monday, I guess?  Yeah.  And all you saw were drunk people.  With sombreros.  With sombreros.  You saw all the fixings.  Yeah.  It's a day where everyone just drinks a lot.  A lot of tequila.  That's all I know about it. 
[00:55:30]  Uh-huh.  What is the actual holiday?  Who the hell knows?  Is it some kind of independence thing?  I defy you to find two people.  Is it a big day for Mexico and why?  I really don't know.  After all these years.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  I know it as a drinking holiday, quote holiday, because a lot of people, you know.  They call it Drinco de Mayo.  Yeah.  Don't have the day off officially, but they take the day and they have fun.  Do they do contests at all about, like, food?  Guac, maybe?  Oh, wow.  I'm reading the Wikipedia and I still don't know. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  I guess it's like St. Patrick's Day, but tequila.  From Mexicans?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right, so what's the problem with mocking that a little bit?  Yeah.  Anyway, so MSNBC did what Ant said.  And is this the actual clip of it?  Yes.  Okay.  ...over the French forces in the Battle of Puebla back in 1862.  It's also an excuse to drink tequila on a Monday morning at work for Lewis.  President Obama will mark the holiday with a reception at the White House. 
[00:56:30]  You have to drink the whole thing and eat the worm.  That is it for way too early.  Morning Joe starts right now.  Yes, the guy's just walking around in front of the camera with a sombrero.  Remember Lewis?  We used to make fun of him.  He stinks.  Not very funny.  You don't think Lewis is funny?  Oh, he's horrible for that show.  Yeah.  But I don't see anything wrong with that.  No.  But he says what Cinco de Mayo is, and then he says it's also an excuse for Lewis, meaning  or people, to drink tequila.  But then it's taken completely out of context by some Mexican guy who talks about how the 
[00:57:00]  horrible stereotypes of the drunken Mexican with the sombrero and the tequila and blah,  blah, blah.  Right.  But again, how MSNBC did not see this coming is amazing, because they are one of the worst  perpetrators of the out of context.  Yes, on purpose.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hugo Balta, the president of the National Association.  Yeah, but how about Hugo Balta, you motherfucker?  I'm a Hispanic journalist.  Called the segment Abominable on Tuesday. 
[00:57:30]  On Monday, Cinco de Mayo, way too early, they made sarcastic references to the way some  Americans celebrate the holiday.  It was not our intention.  Some?  Oh, this is the apology, I guess.  Waddle-dee-doodle.  On Monday, Cinco de Mayo, way too early, made sarcastic references to the way some Americans  celebrate the holiday.  It was not our intention to be disrespectful, and we sincerely apologize for the ill-advised  references.  Ill-advised.  Why don't they just say, like, it was a sarcastic reference to the way some people celebrate 
[00:58:00]  the holiday.  Right.  Like, that's fair to explain it.  Yeah, yeah.  Why does it have to go into, we sincerely apologize?  If you misinterpreted it, why are you sorry that someone else misinterpreted you?  Someone else got it wrong, right?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  They don't get it.  They misheard you, or they misunderstood it, and it's your fault?  God, they stink.  I bet they see that as, like, putting blackface on and doing a minstrel show.  Do we have the actual apologies, Sam?  I don't know if they've done it on air yet.  It was a written apology.  They were going to do it today.  Could you go to the guy who runs way too early, the host, because his tweets were so groveling. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Oh, was he really, um...  Oh, boy, was he.  He's panicking.  Oh, boy.  Please, I can't get fired.  I can't lose my job.  I can't lose my job.  And then, meanwhile, when somebody else does something, he'll be the first one to report  it, and, you know, well, you know, you shouldn't fucking do that, and you should be fired.  What do you think is the end game?  Like, what happens with this state that we're in?  It's crazy.  Does it eventually...  People keep saying it's going to get to a point of critical mass, and everyone's just  going to stop it.  But, like, I don't have enough faith in people that we're just going to realize, like, wow, 
[00:59:00]  we've been hypersensitive cunts.  That's, like, the culture of what we do now.  Oh, they'd love to apologize.  There's the pushback slowly happening, where people are just, you know, mocking everybody  that is apologizing.  There's few people out there that can get away with that, with doing something, not apologizing  for it, and not blowing up their entire life.  Joan Rivers is one.  She's fine after what she did.  Who else?  Ann Coulter.  Ann Coulter.  She could say whatever the fuck she wants, put out books, get on talk shows, and she's 
[00:59:30]  impervious to anybody really taking her down.  That's a small list.  It is.  Louis C.K., probably.  Yeah, but look, they both survive.  Joan, especially, and Ann Coulter, both survive without...  I mean, Joan has a gig here and there, but they're both independent of any company.  Yes.  Like, they're big enough names where they can just kind of survive on their own.  You've got to be your own fucking person.  Right.  Let me say hi to Tony in Dallas, a regular to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:00:00]  Tony?  Hey, yeah.  Hey, hey, if you remember, Danny Trejo, he said that Cinco de Mayo is just another day  that you've got to have bail money because the Mexicans are going to do something stupid.  Oh, man.  There you go.  That's Danny Trejo, real live Mexican.  Right.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Thank you.  So the guy, his name's Thomas Roberts, I guess.  He's the host of Way Too Early.  He tweeted, on Monday, Cinco de Mayo, Way Too Early made sarcastic references. 
[01:00:30]  Okay, it was the thing we just read.  To the way some Americans celebrate the holiday, it was not our intention to be disrespectful.  And we sincerely apologize for the ill-advised references.  Ill-advised.  Couldn't they just say it wasn't our intention to be disrespectful?  Okay.  You just explained to yourself.  Why the apology if people didn't get what you did?  Just go, we were going silly, and some people are offended by it.  And this is how some people.  Everybody thinks if you do something, you're characterizing every single person in that category. 
[01:01:00]  Like, that's not the case.  There are people that go out and drink with a sombrero and swigging tequila out of a bottle on Cinco de Mayo.  Right.  That's who you were portraying in that.  Not every single Mexican person.  It's astounding.  I get that all the time when I say that the hoodie is the uniform of the thug. 
[01:01:30]  I'm never, and I always get accused of saying, oh, so if you wear a hoodie, you're a thug?  It's like, no, don't you get what I said?  A lot of times, and you see that closed-circuit surveillance, that is a hoodie involved in those convenience store robberies and stuff.  I'm not saying everyone that wears a hoodie is a thug.  Just like I'm not saying, I'm sure MSNBC wasn't saying everyone that celebrates Cinco de Mayo does it like that.  Waddle-doodle apology.  I hate apologies. 
[01:02:00]  That's what we get these days.  Clock is reset, huh?  Reset back to zero.  I'm sure we'll get another one.  We've already had two this week, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  So we're back to zero.  We're just trying to go, let's get this out to the media, please, before someone else gets credit for this one.  We're trying to go ten days without an apology.  Ten lousy days.  Ten days in a row, no apology.  I don't see it happening.  No.  I don't see it happening anytime soon. 
[01:02:30]  Not in this climate.  So.  Fuck.  There's that.  And that's that.  And that's that then.  Rob Ford.  What's going on there?  Never made it to rehab.  Did he say no, no, no?  I think he did say no, no, no.  I believe he did.  Yeah?  He was supposed to fly to Chicago.  Chicago.  He was supposed to fly to Chicago for some of that rehab. 
[01:03:00]  And then he never officially made it into the country.  Never even made it into the country?  Was he actually...  Actually, people close to Rob Ford say he's in rehab and didn't enter U.S. last week.  What?  Holy shit.  The mystery of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's whereabouts steepened Tuesday.  So the headlines are wrong.  Following reports that he did not enter the United States as expected, but instead returned to Canada after landing at a Chicago airport.  Ford's lawyer said last week that the mayor had left Toronto for rehab after a video surfaced. 
[01:03:30]  We know that.  Nearly a year after we know that.  All right.  So his plane was headed for Chicago.  But Roy Norton...  Oh.  Relation?  I actually know Roy, yes.  Yeah?  Nice.  ...told the Globe and Mail that Ford voluntarily withdrew his application and entered the U.S. when he landed and was not denied entry per se.  Morris and Doug Ford, Rob's brother, declined to discuss the Globe's report, but insisted Tuesday that the mayor is in rehab. 
[01:04:00]  So he is.  But not in the U.S.?  I guess.  No idea.  The most important thing, everyone who's concerned, if he's in rehab, the answer is yes, Doug Ford told the AP.  But can we believe Doug Ford?  That's Rob's brother.  I can't believe him either.  As far as whereabouts, that's personal, and that should stay with Rob.  Fair enough, actually.  Doug Ford said he has spoken with his brother since he entered the program and that he is doing well.  He's feeling great, actually.  He's feeling good.  He's bought into the program. 
[01:04:30]  Buying into the program?  It's been a day.  Jimmy, can you buy into the program after a day?  They're such liars.  I think that's a little tough.  A little tough, right?  Well, that's his brother.  He's bought into the program, and he's getting the support he needs.  He's fine.  He could go home tomorrow.  Hey, look, you can.  I mean, for many years, people got sober long before there was a lot of rehabs, but usually  you have to go somewhere and dry out first.  But, I mean, it's not impossible.  Okay.  What are we to say?  Yeah.  It's hard to read these things without, you know... 
[01:05:00]  Sucking snot.  Sucking snot.  Little snot sucking going on.  Fucking phlegm.  Why couldn't he go to a rehab in Canada?  They don't have good rehabs?  I think that's exactly what happened.  Yeah?  Maybe they were scared if he's in the United States that they can't control him better or something.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe it would be a lot easier for him to leave rehab.  Yeah, maybe in the last minute, it's like, look, we've got to keep him, you know, close  to Toronto.  I don't know. 
[01:05:30]  I have no idea.  Because that would be a pain in the ass for people to visit him and stuff, too.  True.  Have to fly into Chicago.  Well, that's usually a good thing, right?  A little isolation.  Sure.  Travis, you want a kitten or what?  Of course I want a kitten.  David in Connecticut.  Go ahead.  Good morning, guys.  We've actually got some kittens now that are two weeks old, being handled, raised, and  we've got them in our house.  We'd be more than happy to bring one down when they're aged, free of charge, for Travis 
[01:06:00]  and little Riley.  All right.  Let's put this guy on hold.  Put him on hold.  What do they look like, sir?  There are three little tiger girls and two little black and white boys.  But they're all adorable.  They're all adorable.  You pick them all up at the same time and put them on your face and just go, argh.  When are you allowed to touch kittens?  We were touching them the same day.  No, but I mean pedestrians.  Oh, I mean, you can usually take them home at like six or seven weeks. 
[01:06:30]  That's when you got Beavis?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  He was already growing by then.  Well, no.  He was pretty tiny when I brought him home.  Oh, my God, was he?  We want to do kitten day on our show.  So, you come down with the kittens.  We'll freaking have them crawl all over everything.  That'd be great.  And we'll try to make our viral video.  Oh, can't lose with kittens.  It's got a couple.  Oh, yeah.  That have done well.  I love kitten videos.  All right, David.  Hold on. 
[01:07:00]  Except the ones where you kick them.  People don't like that.  They get a lot of hits.  People do view the kicking video.  Right.  But I think they like other ones better.  Let's say hi to Jacob, who's out of Cleveland.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You guys got to be happy LeBron didn't win the MVP, huh?  Yeah, fuck that guy.  You're still holding a grudge.  That's too bad.  He didn't sound like he gave half a fuck. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, who cares?  That's kind of why I do it.  Go ahead, buddy.  All right, there's this clip from Family Feud.  And there's this chick, huge tit.  She's really hot.  She's got, like, a mile of cleavage or so.  And anyway, so she's, like, jumping up and down and, like, jiggling her tits.  Sam, what are you waiting for?  I didn't hear the first.  Family Feud.  The chick with massive tits.  I didn't hear the Family Feud.  Stop over there looking at Hulk Hogan pictures.  And she's jumping up and down. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  And there's this black guy standing across from her at the podium thing.  Steve Harvey.  Right.  Oh, look at this.  Hold on.  It says, oh, my God.  Wait.  Start over, Sam.  How about you make it bigger, Sam?  So I can see those giant tits jiggling.  No, no, no.  You just can't say your answer right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, we have to interview you.  Uh-oh.  She's a blonde girl with huge, delicious tits.  She's very good looking.  Steve, I actually own a farm and a cafe.  You own a farm and a cafe.  Her name's Carly. 
[01:08:30]  Blonde hair.  Big boobies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me, too.  Oh, that sucker.  Oh.  Your initials are C.C.  C.C.C.  C.C.C.  Carly Christine Kerrigan.  Yes.  She kind of looks like a young Pam Anderson, right?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Double D.  Oh, man.  Look it.  Double D boobs.  Ah.  Of the fake variety.  They're a little tight.  A little tight.  I didn't mean to make anyone uncomfortable. 
[01:09:00]  You can do that on Family Feeding?  This is the greatest show I've ever had.  Why did Steve Harvey decide to keep the big caterpillar mustache?  I don't know.  But shave his head?  I never liked that mustache.  Oh, she's pretty hot right there.  Okay, C.C.  Is she a dope?  Is that it?  Oh, she's coming out of her giant breasts.  I want to kiss those.  Oh, nice. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Are they fake or is she just naturally?  No, those are fake.  She's standing across from her.  I just reach over and honk her tit instead of hitting the little buzzer.  Honk.  Whoa.  She's jumping, like shaking her tits to distract them.  I'd like to go to her farm.  Wow.  Lick her feet.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:00]  It's just a montage of her going out to answer questions with her big boobies.  She's got a nice ass, too.  Yeah.  I love her.  Her ass was wiggling, too.  Oh, look at his eyes.  He just looked right at her tits.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Good find there, Jacob.  Yeah.  We'll tweet this video out as well if you're following us on Twitter.  Oh, and a show.  She's very pretty.  I think I want to marry her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, that explains the gays.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, the gays.  The gays.  What?  It was a camping trip the other day.  Sam's now.  Is that right, Sam?  No.  All right.  This is just nonsense.  I was watching Family Feud.  Look at the ladies' giant boobs.  Yeah.  Fucker.  How boobs?  That's got 700,000 views.  Amazing.  It should have way more.  But there's so many better tit videos with a big dick between them.  That's true.  There's something we said about where they're still covered up a little bit.  Yes.  Here's what we said about that.  Yuck.  I like big fucking free tits. 
[01:11:00]  You want it all right there in front of you.  Uncover that.  Yeah, or at least knowing that.  You don't want them leaving anything for the imagination, huh?  No, my imagination's good for other things.  Thank you very much.  Oh, wait.  There we go.  Ah, Jimmy.  He's just being facetious.  Yeah, he got you.  Mean.  What is that?  Anyway, we have the MSNBC apologies.  Oh, we do?  What?  Two people had to do it.  Two people.  The main guy, Thomas Roberts, from way too early. 
[01:11:30]  And then some guy named Louis, I don't know, Bergdorf or something.  I don't know a lot of these guys.  Is he Mexican, the guy that did it?  No.  Oh, well, in that case.  Here's Thomas Roberts.  Before we go to the cooler, I wanted to take a moment right here, because on Monday, Cinco  de Mayo way too early made sarcastic references to the way some Americans celebrate the holiday,  and it was not our intention to be disrespectful, and we sincerely apologize for those references.  You know, after 20 years in this business, anyone would know.  Oh, God. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, boy.  They made us apologize once, and we did it in disgust.  It was terrible.  We're not good at it.  We don't want to be good at it.  We can't make it sound sincere at all.  You can put that after so many statements.  We're not good at it.  Exactly.  Picking co-hosts.  Wait a minute.  I don't like the direction that went in. 
[01:12:30]  Wait a minute.  I'm not sure which one he's talking about.  He's speaking for both of you, implying that Sam Roberts is a hunk of shit, and I resent  that.  We're in a bit of a quandary.  I don't know which one he's referring to right there, and I don't want to know.  But to add, like, that shit in my 20-year shot, you don't mean any of this crap.  None.  Wouldn't it be funny if he said, I've fucked a lot of Mexican girls, and they're really  good in the sack, and I didn't mean to offend any of those bitches. 
[01:13:00]  For those references, you know, after 20 years in this business, anyone who knows me  knows where I stand on diversity and inclusion.  Oh, my God!  I can't take it.  The insincerity of this is, I'm embarrassed for the country.  This is what we are dealing with.  This is who we are.  This groveling, this, not only did he just apologize, but now he's got to give a little  postscript of how, look, it's the fucking McCarthy trying hearings. 
[01:13:30]  He's got to explain his whole life and why he might not be, it's kind of like when you  used to say, like, hey, I'm not a racist, I got black friends.  I got black friends, and that became like a joke.  Right.  If you say that, it means you are really a racist.  But there was a time when we were growing up once again, that that was actually something  people said and meant.  Right.  There was no joke involved.  Yeah.  That was the way you tried to explain to people that you weren't racist.  And.  Oh, my God, he's going to explain his whole life now. 
[01:14:00]  I know where I stand on diversity and inclusion.  So to those I let down or feel betrayed, I hear you and I'm sorry.  So we're going to go over to Lewis now with a look at the stories in the cooler this morning.  And I know you are contrite as well.  Thomas, I wanted to express my sincere apologies.  Oh, double apology all the way.  Oh, double apology.  Look, it's so beautiful.  Double groveling. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, MSNBC is fucking embarrassing themselves.  Jesus Christ.  Double apology.  So Thomas, the first guy, had nothing really to do with it.  God, this stinks.  He was doing it.  He's the host.  And then Lewis, who stinks on TV.  He was the one with the sombrero and the tequila in Morocco or whatever.  And the other guy guilts him into it.  Obviously, they knew they were going to do this.  But it's like, also contrite.  Right.  Like, it's your turn now to grovel and beg.  Right.  Your turn, Lewis.  Thomas, I wanted to express my sincere apologies as well. 
[01:15:00]  I truly was never my intention to offend anyone.  And if I did, and I know I did, I'm very sorry.  Now, let's go over to the cooler for it.  So check on this past weekend.  Let's go over to the cooler and find our testicles, which we used to have.  But they've been removed and put in this cooler.  Let's go look at them.  Pick them up and smell them.  Cold onions.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I just, I need a shower now. 
[01:15:30]  I'll help you.  Sorry.  Not great.  Oh, man.  That inner voice.  Nice.  Those fucking apologies.  Because, all right.  Wow.  All right.  Let's say we're in their world.  I try to, I really, now that I'm older, I try to, like, try to see it other ways.  I try.  So, okay, they come to you like, look, we're getting some heat.  You got to apologize. 
[01:16:00]  But why does it have to be to the point, like, if, you know, in my 20 years, and if you really  know who I am.  You know my record on diversity and inclusion.  Why go that far with it?  Why not go, hey, we were trying for something, it didn't really work, or some people, it  didn't work with, and we apologize, you know, but whatever.  We were just going for a dumb, silly joke.  Why can't that be good enough?  It's never good enough.  But he brings up diversity in his record.  My record shows.  Let the record show that diversity and inclusion are two of the most valued. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, shut up.  I wish he would have fallen apart at the end.  In my 20 years, I've worked with a lot of blacks, I've worked with a few queers, and  even a few Jews.  And let me say, diversity is important.  Wait, what do you mean I'm doing this wrong?  What?  Right, right.  I'll let you go to the test pattern.  Well, back to zero.  Yeah.  The apology clock.  I'm sorry, guys.  We thought we'd get a few days in without an apology. 
[01:17:00]  A double apology like that is...  Oh, that's classic.  Oh, on this.  Pass the apology baton.  Yes.  Yes.  God.  Lewis, I think you wanted to say something.  Did you want to grovel, too?  Yes.  Lewis, please get down here with me and open your mouth.  But when we had to apologize and they set us down, they're like, and we need both of  you guys to read part of this statement.  And remember, we're ripping up.  We're trying to give any sign possible to our audience that we didn't mean any of it.  You winked, but it was on radio, so it was on a shot. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  But I swear we had no choice.  That's the sad part.  We had no fucking choice.  They would have taken our show.  Yeah.  They would have fucking taken our show.  Yeah.  He would have those guys.  They really were good.  But man, the disgust in our voice and we're just ripping up or crumbling up the apology  to show people it was written for us and stuff.  Yeah.  That was a bad day, man.  I fucking hated that we had to apologize for that. 
[01:18:00]  Fuck.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  I guess we were in the New York Times on Sunday.  Someone's on hold, but...  What?  The crossword?  Ooh.  I know we make crossword puzzles these days.  We're always in that dumb crossword puzzle.  It's kind of cool.  Were we in the New York Times on Sunday?  That's a big deal.  Were we mentioned or something?  Where did that guy go?  Yeah, where's the guy?  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  They did a huge article on me in the Sunday Times just about...  Just men about town.  About town.  Gentlemen who should need to be acknowledged.  It's in this section.  They did not.  We're getting ready for our Guy Fieri interview.  Oh!  You got to hear this song.  You don't have to watch the whole video.  I did a chip video yesterday.  Oh.  But you know how you have to get to the chip part?  Dude, can I put it on YouTube?  The Instagram videos don't go anywhere after a while. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, I don't care.  I was only...  Yeah, but put it on your YouTube though, man.  It'll...  Put it on both is what I'm saying.  Sorry.  But that's okay.  It's only a 10-second video.  But I was watching Airport 77.  Oh, wow.  And it was on like HBO Go on one of their movies.  Right.  And I had to watch it because we've been bashing these films.  And there's a blind singer on Airport...  It's about the one that goes in the water.  In the water.  Oh, boy.  But this is like where they're in the lounge flying around. 
[01:19:30]  And he's singing.  And Chip comments.  But the singing is what I've been obsessively hearing in my head.  And there's a lot more of it.  But you know, in this video, Chip just heard a few seconds and then comment.  Right.  But you have to hear this song.  It's all I've been thinking of is this verse.  It will not go away.  He's a blind singer in the first class lounge of the plane.  Oh, nice.  Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.  That's all I've been thinking of. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, this guy fucking sucks.  His fucking hat's on.  All hip-hop.  Jesus.  This guy fucking sucks.  But that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Oh, wow.  That is bad.  And he's blind.  And there's a...  Remember they put the poison gas through the vents and everybody falls asleep and they take the plane over?  Is that what happened in that one?  Yeah.  And there's a thing where the blind guy falls.  Because that song goes on for a good 45 seconds. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, God.  It's fucking terrible.  That is bad.  It's all I've been hearing in my head is his little...  The beholder.  Is Jack Lemmon in that one?  Of course.  He's the pilot.  All right.  Jimmy Stewart's the doddering man that owns the plane.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Christopher Lee.  And gear you to the people on the plane.  So you care about them and hope they get rescued.  Carlos wants in really quickly before the break.  That's funny. 
[01:21:00]  Mombalessence.  Go to Jim Norton's Twitter.  You tweeted it, obviously, right?  Jim Norton on Twitter for the chip video.  Carlos, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, guys.  Just one last comment on the Cinco de Mayo.  I'm Hispanic, so let me give you a different take.  Personally, I'm embarrassed that I have other Hispanics in my race that would take that position  of being offended.  I mean, I grew up in this country.  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  I mean, do you have a bunch of Irish people on St. Patrick's Day offended that somebody's  walking around with a freaking green top hat and a green vest and they're Irish? 
[01:21:30]  I don't think so.  It's just dumb and I'm offended.  I guess I get deuce chills just like Ant does.  Well, good for you, Carlos.  The Irish don't get offended that often, right?  Nah.  Well, we got one that's actually on the line from Atlanta, too.  Carlos, hold on.  Maybe you live next to Bill.  Bill in Atlanta.  Go ahead.  Billy.  Yeah, I think it's time to start the apology clock again.  You know, somebody needs to apologize for all these stupid, waspy Irish people.  And not Irish people, because it is our holiday.  But all these other, it's like Cinco de Draco. 
[01:22:00]  And, you know, we just have to have more holidays.  But I'm just tired of all the apologies, you know, we're Irish, we're proud of it, and  we like to get drunk and fall down stupid.  And, you know, and then, of course, us dumb walkies, people go out on Cinco de Draco, and  we drink a little tequila and fall down drunk, you know?  Why not?  So it's, you know.  Oh, that's fun.  Yeah, hey, why not?  You know, but, you know, it's just gotten way crazy.  You know, apologize for this, apologize for that.  I mean, hey.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were offended by St. Patty's Day. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, no, hell no.  Oh, okay, yeah, when someone messed up your phone call, I would have never taken this  call.  The rule is you can only point out good things about someone's culture.  Yeah, right.  And when you're using sameness and saying, well, this group does this, it can only be  with something good.  Yeah.  How come no one's ever objected when someone says, you know, the Italians are hardworking  people.  Like, why does not one Italian jump up and say, well, wait a minute, I'm lazy and a lot  of people I know are lazy.  Exactly.  You're lumping us in with their goodness.  Right.  Right. 
[01:23:00]  No one minds that.  Right.  But if you say Italians are lazy, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah.  It's organized crime.  That's the one.  Oh, organized crime.  Yeah, whatever.  I love that one.  Oh, so we're all in the mafia?  No.  Right.  Try saying Italians have giant cocks.  Oh, nice.  Not one piece out of anyone.  Well, blacks.  Blacks don't mind that one.  Yeah, a lot of people really object to that one.  Oh, yeah.  White people object to it for them.  Do you think they want to be classified by the size of their genitals?  If they're black, yes.  If they're Asian, no.  If I had a donger, that's all I would. 
[01:23:30]  You do have a donger.  That's all I would care about.  Is a donger a big dick or is this a heavy dick?  I think it's heavy.  I think it's big and heavy.  Girthy.  And weighty.  Weighty.  Gets a tough time getting completely turgid.  A lot of blood.  Oh, boy.  It's when you hold the cock, half it just hangs like a sausage.  Sausages?  Why don't we break here?  We're going to talk about Monica Lewinsky.  Oh, speaking of cock. 
[01:24:00]  There's some other shit.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah.  This is good.  Man, man, man, man.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah.  He likes talking to me.  I swear he is.  You can't hear that.  The E to the R?  E to the R.  I forgot to mention our podcast.  It's podcast day.  Ooh.  As I suck snot. 
[01:24:30]  Mmm.  Who's that?  And phlegm.  Fuck.  We decided it was so damn good that we put Seth Rogen up on the podcast this week.  Damn.  I know you just heard it, but it's timely with his new movie coming out,  Neighbors Friday.  So, the O&A podcast with Seth Rogen this week.  It was fun, I guess.  If you didn't hear it, man, please go get the podcast.  It was great.  He killed it for 45 minutes, bro.  Yeah.  45 straight minutes.  He was great.  He was right on.  Funny as all hell. 
[01:25:00]  Answers anything.  So, get the podcast in all the usual places.  Especially iTunes for bragging rights, all right?  iTunes.  I tweeted the link.  It's on our Twitter by now.  It's on our Facebook page.  O&A Show on Twitter and Facebook.  And Jimmy's a little bummed because he didn't get his Roger Daltrey picture signed.  Yeah.  That's all right.  It was left.  And I guess either he forgot, someone forgot to ask him. 
[01:25:30]  It's a nice photo, though.  It's a delightful photo.  We both are very handsome in it.  But is it good enough that you got a picture with the guy?  I don't need the autographs anymore.  If I get a picture with a celebrity that I really care about, that's good enough for me.  I'm so excited.  Yeah.  You know, I wanted it because I'm starting to fix my apartment up a little bit, so I'm  trying to display things nicer.  Oh.  So, like, yeah, that would kind of look cool to be displayed nicely.  Do you rotate things?  Do you sometimes go, I'm going to take that down.  This is only being shown for two weeks.  And I'm changing it.  Two weeks.  I'm not far enough into it. 
[01:26:00]  Like, I just got shelving put in and stuff.  And I'm really awful.  So, I'm starting to take, like, I took out, I have to buy new frames.  I don't know how to do that stuff at all.  Oh, man.  But I'm starting to do it.  So, I'm like, yeah, it would look kind of nice to have that.  But it still would look nice like this.  Yeah.  My McCartney.  I just wish my neck didn't look so fucking douchey in my McCartney photo.  You have a douchey neck?  It's a dinosaur neck.  Because I was ready to do a selfie.  Oh, you squished it?  You went for a squished?  Yeah.  Even though McCartney goes, well, let him take it.  He had his guy take the picture.  But I still had Brontosaurus neck. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, no.  I'm conscious of the squishy neck these days.  I make sure I don't go squishy neck.  It's over to the side.  That's not that bad.  No, why?  It's Paul fucking McCartney.  No, I know.  But it's all I look at when I see that.  I don't see a beetle.  I see a fucking slug boy.  I see a blubberneck slug boy.  Blubberneck slug boy.  Slug boy.  With no dashes in between.  One long word.  That's just a cool picture.  Am I right or wrong, Sal?  That's Paul McCartney, man.  Who? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, I'm just looking at the fat kid in the bottom.  Oh.  Neck McGillicuddy.  That's not bad.  Double chin neck McGillicuddy.  I could have that photoshopped.  You want people to photoshop it for you?  I think they could do that.  No, I don't have faith in listeners.  Are you sure?  Maybe Coke Logic.  I'll send a good copy to you.  I don't know.  I think there's a lot of guys out there that know how to photoshop.  Oh, they're going to move your head on bad.  What?  No, they're not.  I don't think they're going to do a good job with my picture.  No, I bet they're not.  No, if you ask them nicely, they'll do the right thing.  I'm afraid that they'll make me look stupid and tweet it to Paul McCartney.  No, they won't do that. 
[01:27:30]  I don't want them to make me look stupid and tweet it to Paul McCartney.  Please fix Jimmy's neck in the Paul McCartney photo.  He would appreciate it.  Yeah, make me look really good, guys.  You just got to ask nicely.  I think we asked nicely.  We're good.  You're going to be fine with that.  All right, I appreciate that.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, my God.  There's a lot you could do with that picture.  Yeah, I may just fix it.  Just smooth out the neck a little bit, right?  Just a little.  A teeny bit.  I think it's a quick fix.  Don't you worry.  I hope so.  I hope so. 
[01:28:00]  Because I'm afraid that somebody may take advantage and try to make me look ridiculous  and then send it to Paul McCartney.  Oh, God.  Well, you know what?  They love you, Jimmy.  They wouldn't do that.  It would be so easy to put something through Paul McCartney's fingers like that.  It's aiming right at your face, I mean.  I didn't even see that as a possibility.  I didn't either, but I'll bet somebody else did.  That's a good one right there.  Oh, I see it now.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  He's holding his hand.  I don't think of something, whatever could be in there. 
[01:28:30]  I don't know what.  You're going to have a perfect picture.  A guitar.  Where's that picture so they can Photoshop it properly for you?  It's up on O&A Show on Twitter.  Look at his fucking picnic bench tablecloth shirt he's wearing.  It's nice, though.  Is it?  Yeah.  You like that?  Yeah, I do.  If anyone in this room was wearing it, you'd be making jest.  I'd put an arrow through it.  But it wouldn't be the same quality as the one McCartney's wearing.  Right, I'm sure that's high quality right there.  It's probably the best shirt.  It's probably an $800 shirt.  And it's probably a cruelty-free shirt.  Right.  He doesn't like hurting animals. 
[01:29:00]  He's a nice man.  In that moment, I interacted with him.  He was a very nice man.  Yeah, what'd you say?  He's supposedly really down to her.  Say, hi, love your work.  What'd you do?  As we were walking, I saw him coming, and I held my camera out.  I'm like, can we take a quick selfie?  And I just, real quick, before he was...  I didn't fumble.  I watched other people waiting.  Oh, no.  Fumble, fumble.  And I just held it out.  And he goes, well, I'll let him take it.  And he stopped and put his arm around me, and he gave it to the guy, and he took a nice  photo.  He was really nice. 
[01:29:30]  But I had the camera ready.  He literally had to stop for two seconds.  He'd go, tch-tch.  But there was another girl.  As soon as we did that, she went, oh, Paul.  Like, she was like 10 feet away.  Bob.  The worst.  The worst.  Oh, so he was stuck at that point.  Yeah.  He's a fucking beetle.  He is.  Well, you know...  Are you still watching the Abbey Road Crossing?  No, a bunch of people that were...  Oh, my God.  I got tweets about that.  How obsessed people are.  Yeah, I got some tweets, and people posting still pics.  It's addicting, for whatever reason.  Let's go there real fast. 
[01:30:00]  Let's just see one.  Let's see what's happening.  It's the Abbey Road Crossing.  Wow, there's still a crowd there, yeah.  Thanks to Guyism for turning me on to this a few days ago.  These people all day long will cross right where the Beatles did for that famous album  cover and try to reenact the photo.  And someone was telling me that people absolutely get hit a lot at this crossing.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  This is the longest we've gone with that.  What are these assholes doing?  Oh, they just crossed the street.  What does it say on that wall? 
[01:30:30]  Feel free to go out and die.  I don't know.  Maybe that's where the actual Abbey Road Studio is?  Is that?  I don't know.  Oh, by the way, the squiggly lines, Ant, somebody tweeted me, was from the Red Hot Chili Peppers  album.  Oh, yeah.  That's probably why you saw that one.  They're kind of crossing the street, and they get the squiggly lines.  That's probably why you wondered why they're...  Yes, I knew I had seen the squiggly lines.  Right.  These are just regular Joes going to work.  Yeah, that one's really out there.  Oh, no, there's a guy with a camera.  He's filming himself walking across. 
[01:31:00]  He's like, look, here I am.  Here I am crossing.  Oh, wow.  And this is the first time there's no one there.  Wow, look at that.  I want to see a head-on collision and four bodies fall out bleeding on that crosswalk,  lined up like they're the Beatles, but they're dead.  I think it's a shitty day.  It's kind of like rainy and stuff.  That's why.  That's England.  Okay.  Isn't that just how England is all the time?  That one was a bust right there.  Jolly old England.  It's Family Feud Day. 
[01:31:30]  And someone turned me on to the fact that Rod Bennington, our good pal.  Uh-huh.  Ron Efez, of course, now on Raw Dog at noon.  Yes.  That Ronnie.  Got the fuck out of here.  That's right.  That's what we did.  Everyone is telling me that Ronnie does a great Steve Harvey Family Feud impression.  Oh.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  It's not Steve Harvey.  Steve Harvey.  You ever watch him do it?  Yeah.  I'm going to do Steve Harvey for you right here, and I'm not even making this up.  All right.  Um, what do they always say? 
[01:32:00]  We surveyed him.  Yeah.  We surveyed 100 mint to find out.  He's always yelling.  He adds a fucking T to the end of every word.  And then, and then he's upset every time somebody gives a risque answer, which is almost every  answer on the show now.  So he's like this.  We surveyed 100 mint to find out what they said was big and hard in they pants. 
[01:32:30]  All right, let's go over here to the preacher lady.  100 mint said what was big and hard in they pants.  Um, their penis.  Oh, damn.  Oh, my God.  She didn't.  You did not say that. 
[01:33:00]  What else was there to fucking say?  Cheese.  What else was there to say?  Steve Harvey.  There's like a whole series of videos on YouTube of him just reacting to other people's crazy  shit.  But it's set up that way.  There's nothing else you could possibly say.  He's a man of God, so we just want to hear that type of stuff.  Or he'll react like they just told him really bad news, like just straight face and kind  of just look at the ground.  Some white guys just standing there.  We surveyed 100 women to find out what on them, get them wet. 
[01:33:30]  Every fucking time he's shocked.  There's very little you can say.  I want to get Earl's family on there.  God, that would be amazing.  I think they dominate, too.  100 men for the interview. 
[01:34:00]  I love it.  Good job, Ronnie.  Look at Ronnie, man.  That's funny.  Ron Efez on Raw Dog at noon.  Very funny.  Now I've got to hear Steve Harvey.  Why didn't we pick up on that?  I never noticed that.  Howie Roosevelt.  Howie.  Hey.  Hey.  This isn't a setup by Steve Harvey, but it's pretty funny.  So there's an African-American family on the Family Feud Show, and the question is, give  me a word that follows the word pork, like pork chop, you know, P-O-R-K. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  Put it on, give it a watch.  It's pretty damn funny.  The first answer, the woman is a stupid answer.  She's pretty good.  Okay.  Wait for the second guy.  All right.  Second guy.  Okay.  The boy values have doubled.  Here we go.  Top six answers are on the board.  Name something that follows the word pork.  Chop.  Lawn.  Huh?  Lawn.  Pork lawn.  Lawn? 
[01:35:00]  Lawn?  Pork lawn?  I-O-N.  Lawn.  Oh, lawn.  I just spelled it.  The hell is a pork lawn?  I thought you said lawn like the grass outside.  I was going, what the hell is a pork lawn?  Lawn!  Looking for the pork lawn.  Yeah.  So this is turning into lawn.  Pork belly.  Pork chops, you dumb cunts.  How dumb are they? 
[01:35:30]  Oh, they're going to play, and there's still time left, so this ain't over yet.  Yeah.  Great times, baby.  Wait for it.  All right, shut up.  All right, all right.  Pork chop.  Thank you, Howie.  Howie Roosevelt dice.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Name something that follows the word pork.  You pie.  Huh?  Holy shit, you dumb motherfucker.  You pine.  Pork you pine.  You pine as opposed to chops. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  Yes.  I said it.  Yes, Lord.  And they're like, yeah.  He said, Q-Pine.  Oh, Harvey.  Stupid.  Q-Pine.  Coupard is doing his thing now.  He's shucking and jiving.  He's acting a fool.  What is Coupard? 
[01:36:30]  It's a good question.  You like that one, Chip?  This is the greatest answer I've ever heard.  I thought penis was.  Yeah, what happened to penis?  Yeah.  Pork penis.  No, I feel you.  No, I feel you.  I feel you.  It's number one.  Oh, my mama.  Pow.  Oh, shit.  He's a little violent.  It's number one.  Oh, really?  Well, I'll tell you what.  It's going to be number one on YouTube.  Oh, shit.  It's number one up there.  I bet every dollar I got. 
[01:37:00]  You the only person that said Q-Pine.  Q-Pine.  Put it up there, y'all.  Put it up there.  Oh, boy.  Family Feud Day continues on ONA for whatever reason.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know how this started, but I think we're running out of clips, though, by now, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Me up the shitter would have been a better answer. 
[01:37:30]  You think it should be pork me up the shitter, Jimmy?  Is that how you were implying?  Yep.  You were subtly implying?  Yes, I was.  Anyone fix your picture yet, Jimmy?  I'll say that they've not been helpful thus far.  Why?  I don't know.  You've seen some?  Yes, I have.  They're not good.  You sure about that?  Couldn't be sure.  Okay.  Couldn't be sure.  Could you pass the tissues? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  I see you're hurting, too, with this shit.  I'm fucking all...  You don't get allergies.  No, my nostrils are all itchy, and my nose is runny, and my throat is scratchy.  Do you look?  I look.  I don't look.  I look.  I can't...  You gotta look.  I'm horrified of snot in all ways, shape, or form.  Gotta look. 
[01:38:30]  Jimmy.  Yeah, I can't look.  They gave you Paul McCartney face.  Wow, if Paul doesn't have hair, he kind of looks a little, let's just say funny.  Let's just say funny.  Handicapable.  Wow, that is really good.  Jim Norton with Paul McCartney face.  Where is that one?  It's called Face Bomb.  I don't know what that is.  Face Bomb.  Uh...  Wow.  So...  How do they see that picture? 
[01:39:00]  Just go to my at mentions.  It just took Paul's face and put it on your head.  Right.  Fenway underscore SB.  Sorry.  That's funny.  Or Jim Norton's at mentions.  I'm Jim Norton.  Jim Norton?  Jim Norton?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway.  Hmm.  We did the Rob Ford.  So Monica Lewinsky.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What the fuck does she want?  This is...  What the fuck does she want? 
[01:39:30]  The way she's talking about what happened years ago and what she needs to do now, it almost  sounds like somebody that actually did something in their life.  Right.  You're talking about, like, she is famous for blowing the president when she was an intern.  Yeah.  And getting cum on her dress.  Yeah.  And that's it.  And now she's like, I need to reclaim my destiny and who I am as a person. 
[01:40:00]  I need to restructure the way I'm perceived in it.  Shut the fuck up.  There's nothing else to say.  Didn't she write a book, too?  Was there a book that came out?  Didn't she do Barbara Walters?  Yeah, yeah.  She did everything.  Oh, she also had a cigar shoved in her pussy.  That's right.  Right.  Because Bill Clinton thought that was hilarious.  Which, you know, I'm not going to argue.  You know, I don't know.  I don't fault...  She...  Like, Andrea Pizer wrote an article, Oh, Monica, close your mouth and disappear. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  It's almost like we got what we need out of her.  Yeah.  And that was...  She was humiliated for a long time.  Right.  And I'm not saying, you know, I got why there was a joke about it, but people are the ones  who talked about her.  She kept her mouth shut.  She wasn't going on talk shows and blabbing about it.  No, she didn't, Jim.  Get it?  She didn't keep her mouth shut.  Oh, she was fucking peckers.  But you know what I mean?  Like, she was quiet.  Everybody got every ounce of mileage out of it. 
[01:41:00]  She was in every magazine, on every newspaper, late night talk shows.  Exactly.  Everyone talked about her ad nauseam.  Right.  And now people are wondering, well, why is she fucked up over this?  Why doesn't she just shut up and get over it?  Because we're done with her.  But if you fuck the married president...  Sure.  You are taking a gamble that if that gets out, you are going to be the scourge, the fucking  scapegoat, whatever, the person that's bullied in the public eye.  You gotta... 
[01:41:30]  That's a gamble you're taking.  And I know that.  Even though she was young.  It's like, what girl's going to say no to sucking the...  It's hard to say no to that.  I bet a bunch did.  You're probably right.  I bet a bunch said no.  And aren't going through this horribleness.  But just that people are mad that now she's...  Like, that's what bothers me.  Not that people made fun of her.  But now all of a sudden they're like, oh, shut up.  But it was like, how come we didn't shut up for fucking ten years about this girl?  Jimmy's riding in on his white steed.  No.  In his suit of armor.  No, no.  It's more like for Andrea Pizer to tell someone... 
[01:42:00]  Are you going to tell me you didn't write about that until it was over?  Hey, now, don't suck that to Andrea Pizer.  I would never answer.  She's a delight.  She really is.  I'm not going to white knight Monica Lewinsky.  I just...  I don't agree on this.  But it's coming out of nowhere, though.  Yeah, that's kind of...  Why is Vanity Fair talking to her, then?  I don't know.  I don't know what...  I think it's posturing for a Hillary possible...  Oh, so they're probably pushing for anything that could maybe damage her.  So let's get Monica back on the circuit.  Back in the news to show that you can't control your husband.  How can you control a country? 
[01:42:30]  But why...  You know what I mean?  It's like, if she's so irrelevant, why would Vanity Fair...  She'll never be...  She's only relevant because we make her relevant.  If no one will talk to her...  She'll always be relevant, though.  Yeah.  Always.  Well, then we shouldn't complain that she's talking.  Presidential shit never goes away.  You're always talking?  She's bummed about her global humiliation, but...  The Kampari.  But she knew better at her age.  She was old enough to know that maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to take a cigar in your pussy.  She didn't blow...  But she didn't blow up the whole spot that fucking fat pig Linda Tripp did. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, good point.  Monica didn't go out and blab to the tabloid.  She kept her mouth shut after that.  She didn't fucking start it.  That was all fatso Linda Tripp.  Yeah, whatever happened to that monster?  I hope she's dead.  She is terrible.  She went away.  There are consequences, though.  Remember when they tried to gussy her up?  Because she couldn't take all that abuse that she was getting?  I think she was getting fucking hammered about how she looked.  And then she tried to gussy herself up.  She is brutal looking.  She's a monstrous, ugly pig.  She is brutal looking.  Is there any recent photos of her? 
[01:43:30]  Jealous fatso.  Try to find anything relative.  Oh, 2013.  Yeah, I think that was jealous.  Of course it was.  Dice had a really funny bit about the fat friend.  The fat friend.  No real new pictures of her.  I would bet that those are all old.  Oh, who?  Oh, yeah, that's fucking John Goodman did her on Saturday Night Live.  I remember that one.  John Goodman played her.  He fucking rules.  I think that's what...  I remember an interview with her. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  And she said that she decided to get herself gussied up, have a little makeover.  Right.  After she saw that they chose John Goodman to play her on SNL.  It was so trying for her to watch.  I jumped out of everyone they could have gotten.  They looked at her and said, yes, you're perfect for this.  Yes, that's it.  And it looks like her.  She says the political machine ruthlessly made her a scapegoat to save his presidency. 
[01:44:30]  She's 40.  She decided to tell her story now because of the suicide of Tyler Clemente, the 18-year-old  Rutgers freshman who jumped from the George Washington Bridge in September 2010.  The guy that got videotaped being gay.  That was three years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that is the guy.  That guy jumps to his death in 2010, which is a horrible story.  And then Monica decides that...  What?  She needed to tell her story now because of that. 
[01:45:00]  Who jumped to his death?  Four years later.  Three and a half years later.  That gay guy in college.  The Rutgers guy with the webcam.  Yeah.  They secretly taped him.  They just showed...  What?  The guy Fieri outside of Fox.  He's outside.  I think they're going to do some cooking.  We might want to crank that volume up when they go back to him.  Yeah, let's do that.  To him.  So we're prepared for our guy Fieri interview.  Oh, yeah.  This piece by Andrea Pizer.  It is...  We...  People...  Like, she did try to move on.  She didn't have anything really take off.  And she tried hosting a dating thing. 
[01:45:30]  And she tried this in that handbag company.  But people's obsession with what...  If people would have just looked at it and said,  That's just the girl who sucked his dick.  Hey, look, he banged a lot of girls.  If the public would have not been so interested,  nobody would give a fuck.  The public became obsessed.  Couldn't get enough.  And now they're fucking mad that she...  She has carte blanche to talk as loud as she wants.  Whatever she wants.  Because we made it.  We made that.  I understand the point when it's a story. 
[01:46:00]  And you're like,  Oh, my God.  Why are people fixating on this?  But you can't just blow that off.  Like it's just...  Oh, it's just, you know, like a celebrity little romp.  She fucking blew the married president in the Oval Office.  Right.  That is a story where the American people will go,  Oh, yeah.  We are going to fixate on this.  And we are fascinated with this story.  Because it's got so many angles to it.  So she kind of, you know,  She made this bed. 
[01:46:30]  Now she's got to suck a dick in it.  But then we should understand it when she wants to talk.  Just don't...  I'm not saying that she should...  People are like,  Well, why is she...  Like Andrea Pies is writing...  Then why are you writing the article?  If she's so irrelevant and valueless,  Why are you writing the article?  Why is Vanity Fair doing an article?  Yeah, it's just weird that it's coming out of nowhere.  I keep going back to that point.  Really strange.  But she's trying to say this Clemente suicide got her thinking.  She said Clemente suicide, she wrote,  Made her mother frantic  Because it dredged up memories of her fears 
[01:47:00]  For her own daughter after the scandal broke.  Oh, she thinks she was going to try to off herself or something.  Do you remember what her nickname was?  Lewinsky?  I forgot until this article.  It's the next line of the article.  Monica's nickname?  Yes.  It was one of the things...  Lewinsky?  It was one of the things they called her.  Lewinsky.  It was two words.  Oh.  Do you remember they used to call her the...  Hold on.  You almost got it?  Wait, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Monica the peck-a-sucker. 
[01:47:30]  They dubbed her the Portly Pepper Pot.  Remember that?  Oh, my God.  What a horrible nickname.  Remember that one?  The Portly Pepper Pot.  You remember that, right?  Yes.  I forgot all about that one.  He works here.  The Portly Pepper Pot.  No one wants to be called the Portly Pepper Pot.  That portly...  Oh, that was a good one.  Who used to say that?  The Daily News?  For her full figure and undisguised lust for the married president.  So that she never tried to kill herself but had suicidal thoughts as the seamy details of their tawdry tryst emerged. 
[01:48:00]  Uh-huh.  My own suffering took on a different meaning.  Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation.  The question became, how do I find and give a purpose to my past, she wrote.  She's 40 years old now.  Give a purpose to her past.  You know she's 40?  Did we say that?  Yeah, 40.  How many years ago is this?  At least 20.  1995.  19 years.  Oh, okay. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, well, that would be a good reason to come back out if it's 20 years later.  If every day she walked around and just streamed through a bullhorn about her blowing the president, we have no one to blame but ourselves because we became obsessed with...  Exactly.  Just a chubby chick who blew the president.  Why is that so interesting to people?  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, even though you're right, I get why she should have known better, but why are we so obsessed with it?  It's a big one, man.  Blowing the president.  It's a huge story. 
[01:49:00]  Blowing the president in the White House.  It's not just blowing the president.  It was a whole thing about his irresponsibility as the president.  His disrespect of the office.  Like, it went into a whole other area than just, you know, sucking a dick or shit like that.  Oh, there's a guy.  He's outside.  Whoa!  There he goes.  Rock and roll, guy!  There he goes.  Ha!  Next to the grill.  Let's talk about...  Come on.  It's grilling time.  Okay.  It's grilling time.  Now, I threw up pork chops. 
[01:49:30]  Why?  They overcook them and they don't treat them right the first time.  So let's talk about the first thing, which is called a brine.  So what we have here is a mixture of warm water, sugar, peppercorns, thyme, little mustard, little granulated garlic, little chili flake.  Pour it right in there.  Okay.  And what happens here is this is a double-cut chop.  Okay, fine.  See, we should have had someone out there today.  Oh, man.  With what, a flamethrower?  Fucking bomb belt. 
[01:50:00]  We should have E-Rock run by just yelling, rock and roll!  Yeah.  Rock and roll!  Woo, rock and roll!  That would be hilarious if he did that right now.  There's no way they're getting down there fast enough.  Yeah, it might be too late.  No, they've got to show the...  What?  They'll come back to them?  They might come back to them.  Because they're cooking right now.  You have to show how delicious it is.  Yeah, we've got to take over Fox & Friends this summer.  It's too easy.  They don't get a crowd for anything they do on the street.  What E-Rock should do is when he's cutting the pork... 
[01:50:30]  I saw a movement down the hall.  They're going for it.  When he's cutting the pork chop, E-Rock should be screaming, murderer.  Murderer.  Murderer!  I know you.  Yes.  I know you.  You're murder.  The boss of Angel.  Yeah, grab this mixture.  The prosciutto.  The prosciutto.  He's stuffing a pork chop like it's a big veg.  With his big ring and his dirty fingers.  Look at all his rock and roll jewelry. 
[01:51:00]  Five minutes ago, he was picking a bleeding roid in his crack.  What's going on?  Is he going for it?  Is he not going to try to make it down there?  Yeah, he was pouting about it, but he's going.  He was pouting?  This is his greatest...  Wow, look, they've got the big grill, some steaks.  What's on there?  They're pork chops.  Oh, well, what?  What is that wishful thinking?  Guy's Gary on fire?  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to pull me away from this? 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  30 seconds.  Oh.  Everybody loves it.  The key to great French toast.  Oh, my God.  Come on, E-Rock.  Where are you?  If the elevator...  They'll never make it.  Oh, come on, E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  Look what we've done here.  Come on, E-Rock.  I'm looking in the background.  Come on, E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  Little Calvados.  Hang on, wait a second.  Let's do this right.  Come on.  Maybe he can just run back there and yell, Fox and Friends.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh, no.  We're getting to the end of the segment. 
[01:52:00]  You can tell.  They're plating it.  They're wrapping up.  No, no, no.  Don't.  No.  Where's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, E-Rock, where are you?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, E-Rock.  Wait, wait.  What?  Oh, it's Asia.  First supergroup Asia.  Oh, where is that chubby bum?  Fail.  Fail. 
[01:52:30]  Fail.  Chubby bum.  But we got Asia.  Well, that's true, but...  Where's that chubby bum?  Not as good as E-Rock jumping in and...  Maybe they'll come back to him.  Making an ass of himself.  Will they?  No, they won't.  Where's that portly bum?  Where's that portly pepper pot?  No, E-Rock's a portly chamber pot.  Chubby chamber pot.  Eric.  Hi, Eric. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  Hi.  Hi, you didn't hear any of that.  What happened, E-Rock?  Yeah, I did.  Oh, sorry.  Well, it was Jimmy.  What happened?  What's going on?  Nothing.  We're waiting to get down the elevator to get out there.  Oh, no.  Where are you right now?  We just walked out of the elevator.  Oh, man.  What the fuck is it?  A hand-crank elevator?  It took forever.  We had every floor for NBC because everybody had to get on at the same time.  Oh, all right.  Well, just hang out.  Just hang out a second because we're hoping they come back to it.  Guy Fieri. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, they went to commercial.  Well, unfortunately.  I want a rock and roll menu.  So.  Ah, we take the pork and we throw the sugar and we throw the beer in there.  Bop, bop, bop.  You don't like that?  No.  I don't.  Fucking.  Fresh ground pepper pots.  I'm not interested in how people make stuff.  No.  I've had it up to fucking here with kitchen preparation day.  That's true.  I got to be honest.  I don't like when they tell you what's in. 
[01:54:00]  Like, all right, we're going to take some onion, some shallot, something.  And then they have the host, they have hosts pour it in.  But I mean, of all these celebrity chefs and people, they make this stuff.  I don't give a fuck.  I've had it up to here with people who, get me some fucking, get me a burger, cook.  Fucking tired of this obsession with these fucking great chefs.  Yeah.  Guess. 
[01:54:30]  Enough already.  Like, they're rock stars.  Hey, woman's job.  Get in there and make me a fucking piece of fish.  Exactly.  Hey, midwife, get in the kitchen.  Midwife.  Make me a piece of cake.  Holy shit.  Go in there and fucking bake me a pie, sir, in air quotes.  What?  What?  What do you rock?  Eric.  Oh, sorry.  I was talking with Sal.  We're just scoping the area.  They got, like, it all barricaded and people by it. 
[01:55:00]  So I'm trying to figure out how to get near it.  Well, you just get behind it and just jump up and down.  You just have to stand right in front of it.  There's, like, a line of people in front of the barrier.  So just push your way in.  And then just jump up and down and wave your arms like a hawk.  Does it look like they're going live again?  They might.  Oh, good.  Hey, it's Adam from TMZ.  How are you?  All right.  Here we go.  Are they going to go live?  Hold on.  They're still commercial.  They're all getting together.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I'm not going to stop that. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  Hold on.  Travis had an idea.  What if he were to yell out, Slavo's hungry?  Oh, that's a good one.  Well, we've got Guy on fire today.  Oh, there he is.  They're live, Iraq.  They're live.  They're live.  They're live.  Jump.  Where's Iraq?  Where the fuck are you?  Get behind Guy.  Get behind Guy, you clod.  Where's Iraq?  I don't see him.  I'm right behind him.  Jump up and down.  They're live, you fucking idiot.  Where are you?  Jump up and down.  Oh, there he is. 
[01:56:00]  Jesus, will you yell something?  Yell.  You're bombing.  Yell.  Oh, he's hiding.  Go behind Guy.  He's waving in the background.  Where's the window?  Yell.  Get behind him.  Yell something.  We'll get fired.  Go to your left.  All the way to your left.  Yell.  All the way to your left, there's a spot open.  Make noise.  Yeah.  Run back and forth.  Will you stop waving like a retarded person?  Yell something.  Yell. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, he's just...  Yell something.  Why are you being quiet?  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't you yell?  Get ready.  That was a failure.  Epic fail.  Where's Kenny?  Epic fail.  He rock.  He rock?  He doesn't want to hear how bad he did, so he hung up.  All right, if I step on his phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kenny?  Yeah?  Do the honors, please.  That was an epic fail. 
[01:57:00]  Epic, right?  Oh, you rock.  Kenny talks like the kids.  I like it.  He had every opportunity to succeed.  Right.  And what happened?  It was an epic fail.  Yeah.  He wouldn't make any noise.  He's just waving like a fucking big, blithering idiot.  Chip could have done better.  Yeah, I would have ran right up under the barriers with my middle fingers up.  Oh, yeah?  Looked right at them pork chops.  Went, fuck you, pork chops.  That would have been a good one. 
[01:57:30]  God, I'm so...  I literally...  I'm not kidding.  I am tired of fucking recipes and how they do it.  I don't care at all.  Are you going to bring that up with Guy today?  You should.  Probably not.  I'll be courteous.  It's his new book.  Guy on Fire.  I don't mind a guy selling a cookbook.  I'm just tired of the country obsession.  Yeah?  With these guys like the raw...  What is Mario cooking?  What is Gordon Ramsay cooking?  That's a giant skewer of fucking shish kebab he's got there. 
[01:58:00]  Well, let's ask about it.  Most people...  Most people would just have, you know, a regular-sized skewer on the grill.  This is like a fucking sword.  What is it?  This is crazy.  Look how big it is.  We're going to talk to Guy in a little bit.  Of course we are.  Getting some intel here.  Jose in New York.  Go ahead, Jose.  Hey, what's up, bu-bu-bu-bu-boys?  Hey, buddy.  Oh.  You...  Ugh. 
[01:58:30]  Listen, listen.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Start over, sir.  Unfortunately, I can't listen to you in the building, but...  92.3 now is stealing your bit of Whip Them Out Wednesday.  I heard them earlier.  What'd they do?  If you give a shit.  What are they doing now?  No, they're telling everybody to do it.  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  No.  They call in today.  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  No.  There's no way.  92.3?  What are they?  What was that?  I don't even know what they are these days.  They suck.  There's nothing else to fucking listen to. 
[01:59:00]  Well, what do you mean they're bringing back Wow?  They're doing it.  They did it about 20 minutes ago.  They did it.  What did they say?  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  I don't believe it.  Just like that.  They said we're bringing back Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yes, they did.  I don't believe you.  Apple funds!  I don't know.  Listen, one other thing.  One other thing.  You're making that up, sir.  I work right down the block, right?  I'm walking home, and I've seen there were protests in E-Rock in front of the Fox building. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, what's the joke?  The rhinos going extinct.  Slabo!  The what?  Rhinos going extinct.  Uh-huh.  Oh, and they were protesting that?  Yes, they were.  Where's Kenny with the epic fail?  Yeah, Kenny might have to go back in.  All right, thank you, buddy.  We'll try to figure out about...  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:00:00]  Yes, Kenny, do you have something to say?  GX, did you hear what that guy said?  Yep.  Slabo!  Oh, Slabo t-shirt's now available.  I'll say.  Thank you.  Selling very fast.  Yeah, get your pre-order in.  Thank you, Kenny.  Before it's too late, it's sold out.  They are just about sold out already.  We're not going to make any more.  Well, then you can get your Opie Quotes t-shirt.  What do you got, Sam?  Hopefully, a rhyme to the dancer. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, no problem.  Huh?  What are you laughing at?  All right, bye.  Yeah.  That was a call from intern Sal.  What do you mean intern Sal?  I mean, whatever.  He was intern Sal on my phone.  Oh.  Sorry, my mistake.  No, the company.  Apparently, E-Rock tried to do a make good because they were taping something and Sal said E-Rock just smashed an entire cake in his face. 
[02:01:00]  What?  So we may have to take back that epic fail thing.  What?  I don't know if it'll be aired, but...  But did Sal get footage of it?  I don't know.  Sal just said to keep watching.  Wait, what happened?  If he did, if he did, it's not going to be on.  How did he do it?  Sal said Eric's...  He was just laughing and said Eric's got a face full of cake right now.  Maybe it was a little segment they were doing and... 
[02:01:30]  Get Sal on the phone.  Why didn't Sal...  Did Sal tape this at all or no?  Yeah, I need to know exactly how this is.  Get Sal on the main line.  All right.  Please do.  He just said Eric smashed the whole cake in his face.  We'll get Sal out in a second.  And we got more Lewinsky stuff.  All right.  Whatever.  Do we have more Lewinsky stuff?  Any of this matter right now?  I think that was about it. 
[02:02:00]  People are not helping.  I think once the Vanity Fair article comes out, there'll be more, but more watch.  More who gives a shit.  I really don't care.  One, I hope that.  About what she has to say.  I'll say...  Nothing new.  Just weird.  Just coming out of nowhere.  That's all.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah.  God.  You're wrong.  We got Sal.  Smashing his face into a cake. 
[02:02:30]  But it was a taped segment.  They showed the cake.  Guy was holding the cake.  Yeah, you're right.  They said Eric smashed the whole thing in his face.  Why would he do such a thing?  Wait, he took Fox's cake?  Yes.  He smashed Fox's cake into his own face.  I want to see that so bad now.  Me too.  I want him to come back with cake on his face.  Why can't we get Sal out of the line? 
[02:03:00]  We can't do anything else.  We're calling him again.  Okay.  I mean, he could be coming back up in the elevator.  That's fair enough.  Maybe he's blowing another man.  Reports are that Eric has cake on his face.  Reports.  Our sources have it.  Yes.  Iraq reportedly with a face full of cake.  But if it wasn't on cam, I don't know why he did it.  Oh, boy.  Maybe he was just eating.  Oh, that could be.  He just saw the cake and used his face to smash it. 
[02:03:30]  That's how he normally eats cake.  Sal just happened to see it.  Yeah, no answer again.  Maybe they're on their way up.  Maybe we'll get a live report as to what happened.  Well, we certainly will in a little while.  On the controversial Iraq face full of cake incident.  Face full of cake incident.  Yes.  And then what time is Guy Fieri coming up?  9.30.  Hopefully, he'll tell us that there's chaos at the Fox taping.  Right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Some weirdo smash just stays into his cake.  But it wasn't live.  No.  Oh, my God.  But it was cake.  I hope he got arrested.  Homemade hot sauce.  He's in a cop car right now with a lot of cake on his face.  Oh, that would be great.  Homemade Iraq would be, like, too shy to make any noise at the TV taping.  Right.  And then decide to make the make good is to take their cake and smash it into his face.  On the commercials.  On the commercial.  Yeah, during the commercial. 
[02:04:30]  Maybe Sal couldn't get it filmed because he didn't know it was going to happen.  Yeah, I don't know why anybody would predict that that was the course of action.  There's Sal.  Hmm.  All right.  Where's Iraq?  He's in the bathroom.  Why is he in the bathroom?  Why is he coming in here?  Did he get video of it?  I didn't even know he was going to fucking do it.  I got photos.  Let's get him in here.  His eyes are burning.  He's just taking the cake out of his eyes.  He should be like any minute.  Go get him, please.  Now, what happened?  Iraq didn't.  They were chasing each other around with, like, a big cake. 
[02:05:00]  Like, she was going to, like, pretend to, like, hit Guy with it.  Right.  So, they were running around a little bit.  They come out of, like, the barricaded area.  Iraq just takes the cake out of the chick's hand.  Smashes it on his face.  The cake goes everywhere.  And he goes, yeah!  And he gives the girl a high-five so hard.  I don't know how you can break her hand.  The girl was Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  He snatched Elizabeth Hasselbeck's cake.  Where is he?  And threw her in his own face. 
[02:05:30]  Holy fuck.  What is wrong with him?  And he goes, the guy, yeah!  I thought you partied!  You think they'll show it?  I don't know.  Oh, wait.  They just entered their show.  Oh, where's Iraq?  Oh, shit.  Iraq.  Let me get a picture of you.  Oh, Iraq.  Are you alright?  Hold on.  Let me get a little ice.  He's got icing in his eyes.  I couldn't see.  It was burning so bad.  Iraq, look over here.  His face is covered with cake.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you steal Elizabeth Hasselbeck's cake?  Right from her hand. 
[02:06:00]  She's walking like this.  I just yanked it out of her hand and slammed it in my face.  And then I went through and gave her a huge high-five that hurt her hand.  Did it get cake all over her?  Yeah.  On her reddish, orange, smart pantsuit.  Were they filming?  Smart pantsuit.  I saw them the whole time, but it wasn't live.  Were they filming?  Oh, my God.  I didn't even have time to get a fucking...  We were watching it on the monitor.  Right.  So we thought it was live.  Oh, no.  So we couldn't figure out when you guys were yelling on the phone, go there, go here.  It wasn't what we were seeing.  So we were trying to coordinate, and then as I'm jumping, they kept tightening the shot 
[02:06:30]  and moving the camera.  Right.  So as soon as I'd start jumping, they were over here.  So I'm running back and forth.  Finally, they had a cake, and I just said, all right, this is what I got to do.  You're committed to the cake.  I like it.  Wow.  Oh, my eye is burning.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, my God.  I think Kenny has a retraction to make.  What was in that cake that would make your eye burn?  I don't know, but it's very buttery.  Oh.  Huh?  Smells delicious.  I just tweeted the picture.  It's hilarious.  No, that's okay.  You look like a wrestler.  Was Guy still there?  I look like a juggalo. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, I was going to say.  Oh, a juggalo.  That's it.  Yes, it's a juggalo.  Eric, was Guy still there?  He saw it, and he just went.  Did he know who you were?  No.  He didn't recognize you.  Oh, my God.  Which is fine, but he'll see me in like 10 minutes or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's here, so leave the cake on your face.  Oh, my God.  Fox and Friends went off the air, so they can't even show it.  They can't even.  They have an online after show that Sam should go on right now, because maybe they're talking about it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Wow, Iraq, that's pretty good.  Bravo. 
[02:07:30]  I take back anything that I said.  But I would like to say.  A chamber pot?  Well, yes, I guess.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to Eric Nagel.  And anybody knows my 20-year history in the entertainment business.  I know, yes, yes.  I have always celebrated people who go out of their way for the show.  Not a bad grovel.  And I humbly apologize.  Oh, let's see.  After the show.  The after show.  Is Heather doing a radio show with you?  You smell good.  No. 
[02:08:00]  No.  Oh, no, she's got to go somewhere.  Will they show it?  Probably not.  Well, if you revealed that.  Is this live?  I don't.  This doesn't look like today, because wasn't Elizabeth the one that was outside?  Yeah, she was wearing like a reddish-orange.  Yeah, this might not be today.  What the fuck?  What did she say to you?  Maybe she changed.  She was all about it.  She thought it was great.  Were they scared?  For any of that shit?  After the cake hit my face, I really couldn't see anybody else's reaction other than Guy mouthing  holy shit and Elizabeth shaking her hand after I gave her a hard high five and cake went 
[02:08:30]  all over her.  There's a good smack sound.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  I think Adam from TMZ was taping it, so.  Oh, maybe he's got something.  Whoa.  Fuck.  Hold on.  I'll write it right now.  That's pretty good.  It's true.  Is he a guy in here?  Yeah, we could get Adam up here.  No, Guy.  Where's Guy?  Guy.  Guy.  Guy.  Did you get cake smashing?  You rock. 
[02:09:00]  That's great.  Smashing.  Yeah, we could take a pee and then talk to Guy Fieri, I guess.  Did you get cake smashing on video?  Yeah.  Can we get your camera without touching you so they can see it?  Oh, yeah.  Let's.  On video?  Video.  Jesus.  Get away.  Ow, you hurt me.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll talk to Guy Fieri and.  But Eric smells like cake.  And Eric smells like cake.  Perfect.  And it's anything.  Sal just tweeted a whole bunch of pictures of E-Rock stealing and then smashing the Fox 
[02:09:30]  and Friends cake.  Happened about, I don't know, 20 minutes ago.  Right before they went off the air.  The video hasn't surfaced yet.  No.  Hopefully they were still running video.  But if you go to O-N-A show on Twitter, you can see a whole bunch of pictures with the  cake incident.  I think it's a policy.  We should film that, too, like when that's happening.  Oh, yeah.  From our point of view.  Because then, even if it doesn't get on TV, you got him prepping and stuff. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there's the high five.  Oh, my God.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yeah, you got a good picture there.  Or back.  Hasselbeck.  Hasselbeck.  Hasselbeck.  Which one is it?  Hasselbeck.  Let's call the whole thing off.  We got Guy Fieri coming down the hall.  Also, our pal from TMZ, Adam, who can't come on the show with us for some reason.  We know him pretty well.  He's outside this building a lot getting scoops for TMZ.  He's a TMZ guy.  I wrote, did you get the cake smashing on video?  And he wrote, I didn't.  Fox doesn't like when I film their stuff while shooting. 
[02:10:30]  He wrote, but it was so insane.  We should be filming that stuff from behind that.  They'll probably save it for tomorrow's Fox and Friends, maybe.  No, they won't because they don't want to encourage it.  Yeah, that's true.  It's like running across a baseball field.  I'm sure they wouldn't want to.  Really?  Yeah.  He's coming down the hall.  Where is he?  I was just saying that for radio.  I say things just for radio.  It would make it sound like we have a real show.  Well, why don't they bring him in?  Walking down the giant hall. 
[02:11:00]  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  It's Donnie Wicklin.  Donnie!  There he is.  What's up?  Yeah.  All right.  What's up?  Hey, Dan.  How you get going?  All right.  Good to see you.  There he goes.  Just give him a wave.  Go do something.  The guy is here somewhere.  Iraq is either off or on, huh?  How about that, huh?  He either runs up and goes, yay.  Right.  Or does something like this. 
[02:11:30]  He rarely disappoints, to be honest with you.  I know.  I'm a big Iraq supporter.  He knows when to just commit.  Yes.  He saw that.  The cameras are off.  Want some?  No, that's okay.  Can I borrow it?  A little prescription?  I need a little shot right in my asshole.  Right up your bunghole.  His nose thing.  Anyway.  What's the...  I thought Guy was here.  I did, too.  I really thought he was very close.  I was thumbing through his book.  A lot of good summer barbecue things. 
[02:12:00]  What do you want?  A chicken?  Want a whole fucking barbecue chicken?  No.  He could do it for you.  No?  No.  You don't care?  No.  I don't care.  I saw Larry King in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Oh.  How was that?  He's got a good stream going still.  Nice piece.  Pretty strong stream.  Yes, but it was shit.  A lot of old people have a problem urining.  Pretty strong stream from Larry King, Don.  Does he have a prostate anymore? 
[02:12:30]  I don't know what the fuck's going on, but I heard.  I heard some strength.  You heard?  In his peach stream.  Good for Larry.  Larry!  Yeah.  How important is the prostate?  Is Guy Fieri here?  Yeah, he's coming up.  From where?  He's coming up the hall.  Oh.  The hall?  The hall is fucking ten feet long.  Yeah, how long is the hall?  Jesus Christ.  Wait.  What's that?  Michael C. Hall?  Wait.  Ding.  Wait.  I have a big announcement.  Oh, a big announcement? 
[02:13:00]  Yes, I do.  Waiting for you to...  Can you make it now?  Yes, I can.  I want to wait for Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  I'll be at the Montreal Comedy Festival this year doing one gig at the Gisu Theater, July 26th.  It's a small theater, and I'm giving the keynote speech at the Hyatt Regency Montreal Grand Salon Opera on Thursday the 24th.  The keynote speech?  Which is the, I guess, the state of comedy.  Andy Kindler does the state of the industry, which is a comedy.  Guy Fieri.  There he is. 
[02:13:30]  Hold on.  You just walked in in the middle of the plug, though.  That's all right.  Hey.  No, Jimmy, finish.  What's happening?  Hi, Guy.  What's up, Guy Fieri?  Take a seat.  How are you?  Good to see you.  People don't like when I say take a seat.  Why?  What's wrong with what he's supposed to say?  He's being cordial.  I know.  What he's supposed to say?  Stand up.  Take a seat.  We were just watching you on Fox and Friends.  Yeah, we were watching you on Fox and Friends.  Where's your boy?  What?  Where's the crazy guy?  Oh, you know who's that?  How'd you know he was our guy?  How'd you know?  Who told you?  I think everybody on the street knows him. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, really?  I think everybody on the street knows your team.  That was classic.  I knew she was going to nail somebody with that cake, and I'm like, I don't want to be  close to this.  Whenever a cake gets thrown, it doesn't matter.  It's just, did you just rent that?  Yeah, but you're rock and roll.  You should be cool with that.  You should be cool with a cake smashing a cake, Guy.  Yeah, I don't think it always happens on the streets of New York, though.  No.  No, no, no.  Parties.  Usually it's a brick from a homeless person. 
[02:14:30]  Here's our guy.  Here he is.  Here he is.  He's still going on.  He's still got cake on his face.  There are footprints, just so you know, across the street, into the lobby.  I saw him at the place where you give the ID.  Then it's in the elevator, and then it's on your carpet coming down.  The new carpet?  Very nicely done.  It's in the elevator.  Another problem we'll have, of course.  Staining the new carpet.  We ruined the new carpet.  We'll be in trouble for that, Simon.  I think that'll buff out.  Hey, what is this?  Oh, it went great.  I think they all loved it. 
[02:15:00]  I have to bring you some food.  Oh.  It's that time of day.  Now we're talking.  I had a cake for you.  Uh-huh.  It's on E-Rock's face.  I hope they show the video.  Flavortown.  Flavortown.  Oh, man.  E-Rock.  What are these?  You're the mascot of Flavortown right now, bro.  Thank you.  This is, of course, your book, Guy on Fire.  This is grilling, tailgating, camping, and more.  Yeah.  It's like summer stuff.  What's the and more thing?  I don't know.  No, I don't know. 
[02:15:30]  Parties.  I mean, they always have to throw that little tagline, and there could be some dressing,  you know, some, I don't know.  Will this help people that are trying to grill that are pretty inept at grilling?  It's more than hot dogs and hamburgers.  I think people think about summer cooking, and they go, what do you want?  Okay, we got chicken.  Right.  I got hamburgers, and I got hot dogs.  Which one do you want to go for?  That's it.  Pork chops.  Little pork chops.  There's a pork chop in here.  That's what I just did across the street with Fox and Friends.  Yes, I saw that.  Oh, my God.  I'm telling you, take that chop.  Here's the key to taking that chop.  So, let's say this is the pork chop. 
[02:16:00]  Make a little hole right here, and then move the knife back and forth so the opening on  the pork chop is small.  Smaller than the hole inside.  Da, da, da.  Now, you're stuffing all the stuffing, and it doesn't come fucking melting, flying out of  it.  All right.  That's the key.  And you're throwing it on the grill.  Because if you go and cut it all the way open, like if you butterfly this whole thing open,  there's no way, unless you have suture, that you're going to tie this in it.  Everything's going to fall out.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I gotcha.  The book looks, the quality of the book looks nice.  That means you're...  This is like a textbook from school.  It's really nice. 
[02:16:30]  Hard.  This is expensive to make.  You can hit the nerd over the head with it.  We did this.  Do you think anyone got hit with textbooks like that in school?  Oh, did they ever.  Wham!  Back of the fucking head.  I remember removing some of the pages from it, you know.  I'll just take random ones out.  You don't need this page.  You don't need the whole book.  There's some great stories in there, and just a bunch of stuff.  I mean, I grew up cooking outdoors.  My parents are...  You know, we live in Northern California.  Oh, my God.  So...  I might hope...  There's a great story of me...  What's that? 
[02:17:00]  Sorry.  Oh, man.  What is that?  Putting food on my Roger Paltry photo.  Chipotle pork tacos.  What's that?  Wings.  Oh!  What is that?  A little salad.  I don't think these guys have a salad.  These guys don't eat salad.  Holy pork tacos.  I can't.  Some ribs.  Come on.  Oh, man.  I'm going to try some of this.  Oh, my God.  This looks pretty goddamn good right here.  Is the pork tacos healthy?  Very healthy.  Very healthy.  We jogged over here with them.  Oh, my God.  Here, Sal.  That is righteous, my friend. 
[02:17:30]  Throw a little salad in case somebody's on that little steak salad.  I'll take steak salad.  Throw it over there.  No dressing, right?  No dressing.  We don't believe it gets it all soggy.  Perfect.  Throw that over here.  You know what I like on the grill?  You know what I like on the grill?  I sketched.  Thank you.  Shrimp.  Shrimp on the grill.  Man, if you get shrimp grilled shrimp done right, it is good.  So here's the thing about grilling shrimp.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put very little oil on it because what will happen is that oil turns...  The shrimp almost turns a little gray.  People put this marinade on it, and then the flame hits it, and the oil drips down, and 
[02:18:00]  then it makes that little gray coating on it.  Oh, man.  So keep your marinades, whatever you're doing with your shrimp, to very minimal oil, but  the key is when they start to turn translucent, when they're turning on you, pull them because  they'll continue to cook as long as they're warm, and that's what happens.  And they don't get rubbery.  Exactly.  Nice.  They should be nice and juicy and tender.  Fascinating.  No, absolutely.  Good point.  Keep talking.  I'll shovel.  No, that's a good tip.  It's a great tip.  You know, another one that I like to do is when I'm doing like a shrimp with like some 
[02:18:30]  garlic or butter or anything like that, and I'm grilling it, is I'll grill them, put that  little char on them, then I'll drop them over into a little side pan, something like this,  that's sitting there with a little of the white wine and the caper and the garlic and a little  parsley, and then I'll just finish them in that.  Finish them nice and warm in that basting sauce.  Oh, it sucks up that flavor, right?  I know, right?  How's that rib treating you?  Man.  It's amazing.  Not as good as that cake and rib.  It's a new, it's a little bit buttery, but yes, it's all good.  I can't take it.  I've got to have another one. 
[02:19:00]  What's going on?  Go, Jim.  What happened?  You don't want one of these?  Oh, they're delicious.  They look good, but I'm just trying to eat a little.  What happened with the hairdresser?  Same thing that happened with your cake guy.  Oh, no.  You shoved something in your face?  I'm glad I can always count on you for that.  Oh, my God.  It's the same as you two.  You spend that much time with somebody and things get a little wild.  He's one of my best friends in the world.  He's one of the greatest guys. 
[02:19:30]  As a matter of fact, I just took all my bros on a trip to Arizona.  Camping?  Yeah, camping like that.  Were you guys drinking on a plane and just started?  I mean, I've gotten into arguments with people I've been hanging out with on a...  Were you guys just drinking, and all of a sudden it just gets a little heated?  I don't know that there was any drinking anymore.  Yeah, look at you.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah, no, it's...  And the great thing about it is you can always just count on somebody with a cell phone.  You know, someone just there to record the moment.  To capture the magic.  Why was he so mad at you?  And he ran away, really.  Yeah.  It was weird. 
[02:20:00]  Listen, it's...  I just chalk it up to...  Lucky you all.  Yeah, it's just guys being guys.  You know, you've got to get into it.  It's like you two get along so well, you know?  It's just...  Well, we've had our problems, sure, but...  Yeah, exactly.  We don't run away sounding like a girl or anything.  Yeah, he seemed like it was...  Well, you just...  I don't think we've ever caught it on tape is the point.  Yeah, at that time, I burst into tears.  Right.  I ran away.  Yes, the first time you saw a seal in Heidi Klum.  Oh, man.  That is so goddamn good. 
[02:20:30]  Is that tasty?  Oh, let's talk about those.  And there's a bunch of those.  I mean, it's not that specific recipe that you've tried right there, but it's close to  it.  And it's a lot of that kind of stuff.  Like, how can I do this if I'm going to go camping or I'm going to be at the lake  or I'm going to be doing a tailgate?  You know, how can I put this together?  Because I think that's why people get limited.  They say, like, well, I have to do something prepackaged because I'm going and what do  I bring?  I try to make it all inclusive.  Like, this is the equipment you're going to need and so forth.  Yeah, because a lot of people don't want to have to bring a whole bunch of shit with  them into the woods or something like that.  A whole bunch of shit into the woods.  I mean, like, you know, cooking equipment. 
[02:21:00]  A whole bunch of shit.  I understand what he said.  I know.  I love it because that is the reason.  So can you actually do some of these things over a campfire?  Okay, so that's how this whole thing started.  That's exactly.  So my wife and I and my kids, we went out to the beach out by where we live in Northern  California.  We just went out for the day.  And the kids said, oh, we don't want to leave.  Can we stay?  And we were in our RV.  And I said, okay, let's stay.  And we went to the store and got some stuff.  She didn't pack it with all the cooking equipment.  So all I had was a cast iron skillet.  So I had one cast iron skillet.  We had no propane stove, nothing. 
[02:21:30]  So I made a fire and I kind of bounced it out with some rocks and I put everything in  this cast iron skillet and I made chicken parmesan.  Wow.  And she's like, what in the, how would you do, you know?  Right.  Goddamn campfire.  I cooked the chicken, I fried it up a little bit and then I took everything out and I  put the tomato sauce in and I made that and the whole thing.  And she just thought that was really interesting.  And I said, it's possible people just don't cook with raw fuel like wood and charcoal and  think they can do anything else in grilling.  You ever tell her, this is your goddamn job?  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  She's from Rhode Island.  She's an East Coast chick.  That doesn't go over real well.  Not once in all these years you look at her and go, start rattling those pots and pans  in there.  No, she doesn't really, that's not her forte.  And she doesn't really excel there.  But she does.  She has her few dishes that she really digs.  But there's so many things my kids inspired in here, you know, things that they made up  or things that kind of, well, like these, we make these sandwiches.  You ever take the, you remember this when you were a kid, the clam shell that you open  and you put the bread in it and you put whatever and then you put it in the fire and cook it? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we started cooking with those again.  So we put like, we make s'mores inside of sandwiches.  We put cream cheese and preserves in it.  But we also take like, like when the kids want pizza but we're camping, we take mozzarella,  a little tomato sauce, a little pepperoni, put it in between a couple pieces of sourdough,  put it in between that clam shell, cook off that sandwich, kids go nuts.  Wow, yeah.  Look at you guys.  I got to tell you.  Out there in the wilderness cooking like some of that gourmet shit.  Gourmet.  It's gourmet.  Gourmet.  I'm trying to eat healthy. 
[02:23:00]  This steak salad is ridiculous.  And it doesn't need the dressing because you got all the ingredients in there.  Oh, yeah.  I say this about salads all the time.  The reason that you had it back in the day with the cucumbers and the tomatoes  and all these different really luscious vegetables was that's where the flavors were coming from.  And sometimes you can just put a little bit of acid on it.  You know, either a little lemon juice.  Fuck yeah.  Not that kind of acid.  Boy, I'd be in business, wouldn't I? 
[02:23:30]  Chip, fuck.  We got a question coming in for you.  Hey, wait a second.  I thought, by the way, weren't we going on tour?  Weren't you guys going to like Branson or something?  Oh, yeah.  What happened with that?  I still got the RV running.  Ask that fucking guy right there.  Oh, shit.  We ran out of funding.  What happened?  Funds dried up.  Yes.  Bullshit.  I was all ready for that.  I was all fired up.  Misappropriation.  Our tour.  Our tour to...  That was before Don.  I know, but you should have probably picked up the ball and ran with it.  All right, well, wouldn't this happen?  Why is Jenny hot here?  Come on in.  God. 
[02:24:00]  Do you know Jenny?  You'll hate her within a minute.  Hello, man.  How are you?  Do you know Jenny?  No, I don't.  And she even says his name properly.  Did you hear that?  I know.  We all say Fieri.  She does a show here, too.  How are you?  I love Fieri.  I love Redheads, though.  Redheads are wild.  She's got a nice red bush, too.  Yes, she does.  No, she lasered it off like a dummy.  The best thing is when she gets naked and plays The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.  They all stare at her vagina.  No, I wanted to see that fire bush, but apparently she lasered it all off. 
[02:24:30]  I think she's trying to throw you off, though.  I think it's big and proud.  You think it's there?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  70s Earth Mama Ma.  First thing, Miss Needy.  Yes, that's me.  Miss Needs attention from everybody.  Did you buy Beth Stern pants?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What?  I cannot, I can't do anything about getting in trouble.  She's married to a billionaire.  Because you posted.  Wait, why did you buy?  No, she posted.  I sent her these cat pants. 
[02:25:00]  I wear these pants, these black milk leggings that you can make fun of the ones you say.  And I really wanted to talk Monica Lewinsky, and I really wanted to invite you three on my radio show at 10.30 this morning after yours.  Yeah, I'm busy.  By 10.30.  Busy.  I'd like you guys to be my friends.  No.  Wait, Wednesday.  You're going to have to say I'm doing on my show.  At 10.30, you ever see when cartoon characters leave the scene really quick, that smoke thing?  That's what happens down the road.  I am so far gone.  I'm just over here, down the hall.  Yes, sorry.  The door leaving this joint has the best line I've ever heard. 
[02:25:30]  Don't go home with hope.  Yes!  That's so encouraging.  You're the best.  Leave all hope behind.  As soon as we put that sign up, everything got better.  Yes.  You probably realized.  Yeah, because you lower your expectations.  I mean, why go away with this optimism?  Exactly.  That's bullshit.  So, Jen, you bought a billionaire's wife a pair of pants.  They had cats all over them, and she's like a cat lady, so I really was just being nice.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  And they looked really good on her, so.  Yeah.  You want to be friends with her?  Well, anything would kind of look good, right?  We're friendly.  I like Beth.  She's a nice girl.  Mm-hmm.  She doesn't even know your name.  She said, thank you, and you were like, oh, they look great on you.  Retweet, retweet, publicity.  I only retweeted once.  Just once, and that was it.  It's enough for me to see it.  Oh, brother.  Do you know, I thought in my head, I was like, oh, I better not, because then I'm going to  get, and then I was like, I was okay, because nobody said anything.  Yeah.  Why not just give a nice gift?  And now that you just said something.  I know.  You get the wrong with giving someone a gift, and if she tweets a thank you, that's very nice 
[02:26:30]  of her.  But the humble brag.  But why keep going?  It wasn't a humble brag.  I just said they looked great on her.  You retweeted it with little old me, question mark?  Oh, gosh.  I did not say little old me.  Lil, L apostrophe, I L.  Do you have any of those pants?  Do you wear them?  Yes, those are the ones I wear.  Cat the time.  They have salmon on them.  It was a salmon.  Do you got the fat girl person still?  Did you come in here for this?  No.  I have a show at 10 o'clock.  I know, but what did you, how did they rope you into this?  No, no, I wanted to come in because I want to invite Jim and Oprah to come on my show 
[02:27:00]  at 10.30.  She used to be chubby, too.  She was a chubby girl.  I'm a little fat today, too.  No, you look great.  Hence the moo-moo.  But it's all right.  Huh?  A little bloated.  A little bloated.  Game of the period, it's awful.  I am turned on.  Oh, you still got that thing?  I do.  Wow.  That's so gross.  That's so fucking gross.  I thought maybe that.  It's so gross.  Opie, I agree.  It's awful.  Midnight's winter.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  No more eggs in the fridge right there. 
[02:27:30]  It's like, oops.  Trying to make some breakfast.  Doesn't it smell worse when you get older, too?  No.  Damn it.  I'm very clean, Opie.  All right, that's too far.  You do.  You know, you're always very well put together.  Yes.  I believe in good, proper grooming.  She's one of the few older broads that I actually really find attractive.  Okay.  Thank you.  Isn't it just the backhanded compliment?  It's, uh, central here.  It's expected.  I know.  Yeah, well.  Oh, Jenny, what do you got going on on your show today?  Ricky Lake's coming in to talk about breast milk. 
[02:28:00]  What?  What the hell's that about?  She has a movie called...  No.  No.  Okay.  You got icing in the hair.  Right in the hair.  Right in the hair.  Fuck.  Oh.  Hey, Rob, you got icing in her hair.  Hold on.  You got to give her a thing.  Why?  It was like this.  But you gave her...  Oh, you got icing in her hair.  Hey, Rob, give her a motorboat.  Give her something to wipe her.  A motorboat.  Shit.  Motorboat.  A motorboat would tweet well.  Motorboat.  Motorboat.  Hey, a motorboat would tweet really well.  Okay.  Motorboat.  Can we...  The pictures are freaking me out. 
[02:28:30]  Jenny, if there's a motorboat, that will...  Tweeting it, that will be Instagram, that thing?  A motorboat would be huge.  My husband might not be happy.  Probably not.  Her husband's a big dude.  Yeah, he's a big in-shape guy.  Well, if you haven't pissed him off by now, I don't know that the motorboat's gonna...  He knows that I'm very complimentary.  He doesn't come at you and he likes you, so he's not...  He came over the house that day.  So he doesn't mind you...  We love your house.  ...talking about her bush.  I'm going to be having a couple of parties this summer, of course.  I got the Memorial Day one. 
[02:29:00]  I'll let you know when that is.  But then the big 4th of July slash Sister Dawn's party...  Yes.  ...that our own Denny Falcone will be spinning the hits at.  Okay.  Can we do karaoke?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  I'm there.  Get Guy to barbecue.  Oh, there we go.  Spinning the hits.  Spinning the hits.  That's 70.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me, he's Denny Falcone.  He has his hard drive of hits and, oh, it's all the favorites.  So what...  When is this?  July 4th and 5th.  I'm doing two days.  Oh, so people can't go home. 
[02:29:30]  That's the thing.  Exactly.  We always kind of...  All the parties carry over from a Friday to a Saturday.  Give me your keys and get bail money.  That's my favorite party.  That's pretty much it.  Nice.  Pool's all heated, ready to go.  Nice.  Listen, I got the recipes ready, Rock.  Oh, yeah.  We got a question coming in.  Nice.  Oh.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, it's me, Lady Di.  How's everything?  God, I hate this woman.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  Sam told me to call the show today.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  We got Guy Fieri in.  What do you want to ask him? 
[02:30:00]  Who do you have in the studio?  Guy Fieri.  The chef.  Guy Fieri.  Bill, do you know what Guy Fieri is?  That might be one of my relatives.  What are you guys doing?  She's lost this one.  What is he, a comedian?  I don't know who it is.  He's like a rock and roll cook guy.  I work at Macy's.  I work at Macy's.  You probably met him when he tried to shove an apple in your mouth.  Get on this.  That sounds familiar.  Yeah.  The name sounds familiar. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  That's got to make you feel good, Guy.  Well, at least I know there's still an audience.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Teddy Falcone just came in.  I understand that Guy has questions about the hard drive of hits.  Is that true?  No, I just like the term spinning the hits.  Well, we're spinning the hits off the hard drive of hits.  We're now officially at Jim Norton's Nightmare.  It's just a festival of neediness.  There's so much need around this show right now. 
[02:31:00]  Are you retweeting another compliment, Jenny?  Jenny, I love you.  You know that.  What time do you want me to be on your show?  Jenny, read the door.  Go home.  Yeah, without hope.  Jenny, you ever want to cheat on that husband of yours, have an affair?  You know where I live.  It's close to your house.  Come on over.  We'll do some of that fucking...  Yeah.  It'll be great.  Thank you.  That's cool.  Thanks for the offer.  I figured, why beat around the non-existent red bush?  We'll do that fucking...  You could have hinted and done it like I do.  We did a little...  The handshake left and right.  You do that? 
[02:31:30]  A little, yeah.  All right.  Will you guys stop by, please, maybe?  Be real subtle with it.  Maybe, maybe.  Not even a chance.  Lie to me.  Lie to me.  My truck is already warming up outside.  I'm going to leave fucking burnout marks.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, she's great.  What happened to the lady that called?  Oh, you want her back?  No, no.  She thinks I work at Macy's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy, Fieri guy.  Yeah.  Okay, wait, hold on a second. 
[02:32:00]  What does he sing?  A lot of Captain and Tennille.  He sings a song called, Have Another Beer, Pig.  No, no, no.  Forget about that.  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, how many natty ices have you had so far today?  This is my fourth one.  Four natty ices before ten.  That's awesome.  That's amazing, isn't it?  Is there any heavy equipment being used?  Just her body.  Exactly, yes. 
[02:32:30]  It's called a monster machine.  No, there's no heavy equipment being used.  No, no, no.  You're interrupting our Guy Fieri interview, but really quickly, we heard you shit your pants the other day.  Yeah, what happened?  No, I did not.  No, I did not.  What happened?  Did you pee yourself?  A little bit.  How did you guys get this intel?  She's a regular.  Yeah.  I think her best friend calls in and says...  Said that she had pissed herself.  No, no, no, no.  Now, why were you in... 
[02:33:00]  You were at home, though.  You're in bed on the phone, and you pissed yourself.  I wasn't in bed.  She was on the phone with us when this happened.  Why didn't you just...  That's why the connection.  Why didn't you just go to the bathroom?  Because I don't take my cell phone to the bathroom with me.  It's as simple as that.  Oh, you're missing some of the best cell phone time.  So she'd rather piss herself.  No, I didn't.  It was just a little...  Oh, my God.  Do I have to explain it to you?  It was only a little bit.  It wasn't like...  Did you take a picture of it? 
[02:33:30]  It doesn't matter.  Only a little bit.  So you don't take your phone to the bathroom, but you'll piss yourself on the phone.  It doesn't make sense.  You're just an embarrassing person at this point in your life.  You really...  You know what?  You're an embarrassing person.  Yes.  You have a grown son, and you shit and piss your pants.  You're an embarrassing human being.  I might even be mean to you.  Jimmy, I'm just being honest.  I know you are, and I'm just being honest, too.  You are an embarrassment as an individual. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, well, I'm sorry.  You should...  Now, don't apologize to me.  Apologize to the kid that has to walk around and go,  I fell out of that woman's vagina.  You're an embarrassing individual.  I'm not even kidding you.  You're an embarrassment.  Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way.  You should feel that way.  Yes, you should.  You shit and piss your pants.  You're in your 50s with an adult son.  You have zero dignity.  You don't take care of yourself. 
[02:34:30]  You vomit in the...  You're just a fucking embarrassing person.  You call up every day, drunk.  My fourth beer.  It's like you refuse to do anything for yourself.  You just leech off another drunk.  Ugh.  This is not drunk for me.  I know that, Diana.  I understand that.  But I'm glad you caught the point.  That's right.  I'm glad you got the message.  At least you're not an ass who misses the important point.  Okay.  I'm not drunk.  No, no, no.  Sam told me to call the show today.  I know he did. 
[02:35:00]  Plow right on to more nonsense.  Your life is just one long act of nonsense.  Well, gee whiz, I'll try to change that, okay?  Ugh, no.  You're not going to try to change that.  No one believes that anymore.  Have you found a job yet?  No, I have not.  When have you looked?  Just an embarrassment.  What was the last time you looked for a job?  A month ago.  Where?  What do you think?  The same places.  You keep going to the same... 
[02:35:30]  I go back to the same place all the time.  It would be Satan's doll, trust me.  An-an-an-an-an-an-an.  What?  There's nothing out there.  Not if you keep going to Family Dollar every fucking month trying to get a job there.  Well, I go there anyway because I have to buy things over there.  Oh, God.  Fucking worst.  So it's time to check to see, you know, what's going on.  Do you think your son is happy to point you out to his friends?  This Mother's Day.  That's my mom?  That's my mom over there?  The one who can't control herself going to the bathroom because she's drunk in the morning 
[02:36:00]  on the radio show?  I don't tell...  Wait, hold on.  I don't tell my son these things in the first place.  You're just an embarrassment.  I don't tell my son these things.  You really should feel embarrassed about the way you live your life.  And he does come over once in a while.  Yes, he does.  Are you seeing him for Mother's Day?  Yeah, I believe so, yes.  I believe so.  Why would he?  He'd probably go to his girlfriend's parents.  No, no, no.  No, I'm just telling you because he didn't call me yet.  Why would he?  Usually he calls and he says, is it okay if I come over? 
[02:36:30]  And I'm like, yeah, sure.  You can come over anytime you want.  All right.  So he's probably...  Okay.  I pissed myself.  Come on over and change me.  Oh, will you stop with that already?  All right.  Thanks, Lady Di.  I decided to just have another taco.  This steak thing was ridiculous.  That's so good.  I haven't been to your joint in a little bit.  Well, you got to hook up.  Tell me when you're ready to come.  The food's amazing, but I'm trying to eat, you know, well.  No, we do.  But you guys do the...  You do it right by me when I go there.  No, exactly.  That's what a restaurant's supposed to do when you come in and you say, well, you know, 
[02:37:00]  I'd like it this way, but I...  The restaurant's kind of got to weigh sometimes and say, well, this is the only way we're doing it.  You're the one paying for it.  You tell me how you want it.  So the cook doesn't spit in your food if you do that.  No, that's not the...  At least not at my joint.  It doesn't.  Of course not.  I just opened a new place in...  You guys go to Vegas often?  Well, not as much as we have.  You guys used to do some live stuff out of Vegas.  We're so long going to Vegas.  I just opened a new joint in Vegas right on the strip called Guy's Vegas, and it is banging.  I mean, it's right there in the middle of everything.  They built the IP, turned into what they call the quad now, and they made this thing called 
[02:37:30]  the Link, and they got the biggest roller coaster, the biggest Ferris wheel in the back.  Yeah, we just talked to the guy that did that whole thing.  It's crazy.  I mean, I don't think Vegas could get any more out of bounds, and it really is spinning.  Guy Vegas.  The E-Rock cake thing just made the live stream for Fox & Friends.  Do you guys understand what happened?  Did you see the whole thing?  No.  No, we haven't seen it yet.  Somebody just told us that it just streamed live about 10 minutes ago.  So here's what happens.  So we're out there, and we're cooking.  We're doing this pork chop, this awesome pork chop. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, I saw that.  We're doing that, and we're making some French toast and the whole thing, and Elizabeth  Houseback, she grabs the cake.  I act like I'm going to hit Ryan with it.  She grabs it at the end of the show, and she starts to chase him down.  I mean, really, she's going to get him.  I mean, she's fit.  She's fit.  In heels, she was still gaining on him.  Yeah, she has nice calves.  So she's chasing him around, and she goes in the building and out of the building the  whole thing, and I'm just staying away from her because I know the cake's going to end  up on me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Comes right around the corner.  E-Rock grabs it.  It is fast.  I thought she had hit him until he high-fived her and took her arm off. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I heard it was a very hard high-five.  Yeah.  Well, he's been known to spank women very hard.  Lenny, in A Mice and Men, is based on his interaction with women.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, he found it.  Oh, sorry.  There it is.  I think he really thought, oh, my God, this is going to disrupt.  I was ready to assist.  Well, the thing is, you've got to say, like, I did it.  Oh.  And it would have looked like I did it.  Nice big cake.  She's picking it up.  Oh, boy. 
[02:39:00]  Here's where the guy starts backing up.  She knows there's going to be trouble.  Oh, she threw it and missed.  And it lands on her.  She doesn't give up.  She doesn't give up.  Now, watch it.  She's chasing him with a cake.  Oh, no, on the other side.  Hold on.  She's lost her mind.  She literally, oh, there's E-Rock in the back.  Oh, cake, boy.  Look out, people.  Oh, that ain't going anywhere.  Here's E-Rock.  Did you see me book?  Oh, look.  There she runs through the door.  All right.  She's running all around the area around Fox. 
[02:39:30]  E-Rock's moseying around outside.  Hey, guy, come on back here.  She's, like, hunkered down somewhere.  He's not flying.  I've booked.  Did you see me?  Listen.  There's no cake, E-Rock.  Someone's going to get it.  She's in the building with the cake at this point.  You can see cake droppings.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  She's dropping a deuce on it.  I'm trying to see where E-Rock is.  And then literally she was in traffic.  Oh, there's E-Rock. 
[02:40:00]  He's jumping.  Jumping and waving like a maniac.  It's the subtlety of your show.  It's the subtlety.  Right.  Rosettes.  All right.  Some cake on the rug.  She was very close to getting him.  And then she, you know, she did chase him into the mirror.  E-Rock's still back there.  Yeah, he's waving his arms.  Pretty much.  Jumping.  Boy, you really are on camera.  Where'd she go?  Oh, wow.  Oh, there she is right now.  Ah, doing a shot? 
[02:40:30]  Why not, right?  Look at E-Rock.  E-Rock sent.  All right.  She's running now.  She has the cake.  E-Rock took it.  Matching himself in the face.  Because that's how you do it.  Rock and roll.  That's how you do it.  And he high-fives her so hard.  Oh, E-Rock.  Her shoulder.  Took her arm off.  He's got his arms up.  E-Rock.  That's a good one, man. 
[02:41:00]  Not too close.  As you can notice, you've got...  You high-fived cake all over her head.  That's good.  On your birthday.  Guy, I knew you...  Watch this.  I try to be a nice guy.  What's she doing?  Wow.  Well, you know what that's like.  Let me get that out of your hair.  Oh, shit.  She puts them on your face.  I got it, Jimmy.  Go out to everybody else now.  I've got to go.  See you tomorrow. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, man.  That's funny.  Maria, you're safe.  Wow.  E-Rock.  E-Rock owned that.  E-Rock.  Good job, E.  He took the cake.  That's pretty cool.  Way in the background, you can just see it.  Yeah.  He picks up that cake and smashes himself.  Smashes him in the face.  Delicious money shot.  Good job, my friend.  You high-fived her harder than I've seen UFC fighters get hit.  You really like to high-five girls hard or spank them hard.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:42:00]  We remember that.  This is it.  Right here, right here.  Wow.  God.  Double caked himself in the face.  But look at this.  Do you notice how he didn't get any on his shirt?  Yeah.  He was able to get it just, I mean, it looks like he's going to, you know, some Japanese theater.  He's got a cookie theater.  He spiked the cake after he hit himself in the face.  Yeah, yeah.  E-Rock getting it out of his retina.  Oh, that's great.  I love it.  It's classic.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Fucking E-Rock is...  After all that, I think I've got to take a, what they call a piss break.  Yeah, we'll do that.  You hang a guy or what?  I don't know.  Until they drag me out.  Guy.  Yeah, no.  This is great.  Guy on fire.  On fire.  That's the book.  Grilling, tailgating, camping, and more.  And more.  Best seller.  Hey, there's some good stuff.  There's some good stories.  Catfishing.  Like I said, let me tell you something.  I try to barbecue and stuff, and, you know, I'm pretty good at it, but it's all the basics.  I want to kind of make a little flash this year. 
[02:43:00]  It's going to push you over the top.  That's what I want.  The thing is, this is, I dedicated this to my dad.  My dad is the guy that taught me that everything can be cooked outside.  Oh, yeah.  Most of the time, because it had to be.  Is he living your dad?  Yeah, my dad's living.  And my father-in-law's not, but those are the two cats that I cooked outside with, and  it's got some good stuff in there.  I think you'll dig it.  There's some good cocktails, by the way.  Absolutely.  Oh, where are the cocktail sections?  Oh, look at them.  Let's open it back up.  Where's the cocktail section?  Those are all important at the outdoor parties. 
[02:43:30]  Very necessary.  You're looking at martinis or what?  How to fill a bathtub full of gin.  Oh, yeah.  What have we got?  Girly drinks?  What have we got?  Where are the drinks?  Oh, it's outdoors.  I don't know where this is.  Oh, that looks good.  You didn't even write this book, did you?  Oh, come on now.  You actually read it.  You wait to see some of the stories in there.  How's Hunter doing?  Hunter's great.  Hunter's almost 18.  I'm trying to figure out what to do for his 18th birthday.  I'm trying to figure out what it's going to be.  I was thinking about taking a bunch of his buddies to Mexico, but I don't want that liability.  Oh, man.  He's almost 18.  Yeah, he's 18.  Six foot.  It's all...  That's bullshit. 
[02:44:00]  He's getting taller than me.  How did that become part of the deal?  If I'm paying the bills, stay short.  But Ryder's in eighth grade, and yeah, Hunter's going to prom this weekend.  He's trying to borrow.  He wants to drive one of my cars to prom.  So he's all over, like, trying to tell me all the good things he's done.  Why do they say to prom?  I always said the prom.  I guess I am wrong, because every other part of the culture says going to prom.  Yeah.  It is prom.  Going to prom?  I don't know.  Is it going to prom?  Go to the prom.  Go to the prom.  The prom's a place.  I'm going...  Yeah, I guess I'm going to supermarkets. 
[02:44:30]  It's not.  I'm going to dentist.  Yeah.  It's not the English guy.  I'm going to make dentists.  He had to go to hospital.  I'm going to university.  Yeah, but then they also said, we're going to a bailout.  All right.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nice.  No words spoken, because I couldn't think of colonized.  No.  Oh, shit.  Are you going to give him some tips on how to get some action?  I think he's doing all right.  How does a dad handle that these days? 
[02:45:00]  We've had it.  Give him a few pointers?  We had the whole discussion.  We talked about, you know, we went through all the protection and that whole thing.  And, you know, he's a smart kid.  He knows all that, but, I mean, like some new moves or something, you know.  I'm 46.  I think they've reinvented the moves.  He's 18.  If he wants to ruin 46, here's one of the lines, okay?  We're going to be spinning the hits.  I got you.  Here's what you do.  You hand him one of these ribs and you say, show this to your girl. 
[02:45:30]  She goes, oh, that looks delicious.  And then you take some of the rib and you rub it on your dick and go, well, then taste it, stupid.  I don't think that would work very well.  That would work very well, because she wouldn't.  She'd go, wait a minute.  Well, that sounds about right.  I'm going to have him call Uncle Jim.  That'll be great.  Uncle Jim will take care of it.  Let Uncle Jim help him out.  Oh, my God.  Well, I got to tell you, thank you, guys.  No, thanks for having me, guys.  Nice to see you.  It was a great book.  You know when we're cooking it.  I'm going to take this home.  I don't normally take any of the books that people come in here on.  I see him stacked in the corner. 
[02:46:00]  But this is something I could use this summer.  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  The Alcoholics Anonymous big book.  There's pictures and it's good Kinlan starting.  Wouldn't that be great?  You just use the book to rip the pages out and start the calls with?  Isn't that what it was for?  What are you, what's your thoughts on Anthony Bourdain?  I mean, he's, I meant to ask you that.  You, Jimmy?  Were you, Jim, weren't you there?  At the roast.  Yeah.  He takes shots at you, though, huh?  Not, you know, not many.  It used to be his favorite thing. 
[02:46:30]  I mean, Bourdain's super talented and the roast was, that was an event.  He invited me to the roast.  So that was kind of an adventure.  So it's more in fun, you think?  You know, I don't know.  I don't know Anthony really well, but it's.  Do you take shots at him?  No, I'm not that kind.  I don't really take shots at people.  I'm not a, I grew up in Northern California.  I'm a hippie kid.  I don't really, that's not my energy.  I'm more into good.  My new motto, though, is don't leave here with any hope.  I mean, that's a great motto, man.  You know, James out of all things.  But do you hate the way that these food, these, like, you know, whatever, 
[02:47:00]  not to say food experts, but they kind of treat you shitty.  Like, they kind of, they talk bad about you.  I don't get down with it, man.  I don't listen to it.  I don't participate in it.  I don't even, I don't even give it my energy.  You make enough money.  I got a lot of other great shit to deal with and things to do and positive things to make happen.  I'm real into, you know, my charity and working with kids and, you know, helping on that stuff.  So opening restaurants and writing books, doing shows, Triple D.  What am I going to get you guys on Triple D, by the way?  Were we supposed to go do some?  Come on.  We gave up on that.  We've never been invited. 
[02:47:30]  We get invited on some goddamn road show.  My RV is still running and you guys are going to give me shit.  We get these vague invites.  I don't even know how to get a hold of you.  Here's what happens, guys.  You know, I love this.  We get invited on the show and then when people walk out, they walk through this weird film  where they forget we were alive.  A lot of times we had to tell people, no, you just did our show.  You told us we could come in for this.  No.  Those days I would, you know, next time you're in L.A., look me up and then the guy would, 
[02:48:00]  you know, the person would leave and they're like, I don't know if he's numbers.  I could have given you invites to NorCal, to the wine country and all that because you  guys, you guys give me, oh, yeah, sounds great.  We'll be there tomorrow.  You should do something with my brother's restaurant.  That's what we've talked about this.  You'd actually have a really good time with that.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  So we do your brother's restaurant.  You show.  I just want, but he doesn't need your help.  He's doing very well.  No, that's what you're talking about.  Okay.  That's what you're talking about.  He doesn't need your charity.  That's really nice.  Hey, we like your show, but screw yourself because we don't need your help.  I don't want to sound desperate because my brother works his balls off, but it would 
[02:48:30]  be quite a joy if you did do something is all I'm saying.  Okay.  If you come and do it.  All right.  A-Rock's face is still covered with K.  Classic.  I don't know.  He's good like that.  He's going to break out acne with that.  I know, right?  That's going to, that oil on that is, no.  Guy, it's always a pleasure.  You guys are great, man.  Yes.  Thanks a lot.  I know you're a busy man.  The book is called Guy on Fire.  It's going to do very well for the barbecue season and summertime.  Grilling, tailgating, camping, and more.  Number one New York Times bestselling author, Guy Fieri.  You're awesome, guys. 
[02:49:00]  I'm a pal, too, by the way.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Nice to see you again.  And I'd be more than happy to take it to break with a little something off the hard  drive of this.  Wicked, wicked, wicked.  Yeah.  So let's slap up Donna Summer tune for us today, all right?  Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together one more time.  The Opie and Anthony Extravaganza, he stopped by today.  He's got a brand new book called Guy on Fire.  Barbecue season is just knocking on the door, so we've got some hot stuff puppet for you.  Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Summer.  Boo.  That's the best. 
[02:49:30]  He hit the ramp, though.  Now make sure the listeners hear the entire song.  Here we go.  Oh, good guy.  Heating my heart out, waiting, waiting for some lover to come.  Talked about a thousand numbers lately.  Almost sang the phone off the wall.  Looking for some hot stuff, baby. 
[02:50:00]  I want to thank Guy Fieri for coming by.  Supposedly he's going to film something at my brother's restaurant.  I'll believe it when I see it.  Oh.  F.H. Riley's 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  He's a fun guy. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, he's a very good guy.  Yeah, he's a very cool guy.  He's a guy, guy.  A guy's guy, right?  Did Larry King recognize you out there?  No, neither.  Me and Obi-Wan Pye.  It was me and you.  It was me and that one.  It was me and you, yeah.  Not a lot.  We used to say, hey, Larry.  Oh, no, we have the trifecta.  Remember when I was talking about his stream in the bathroom?  I did say hi.  He looked over and went.  There was no recognition.  No recognition.  I understand.  Look, the guy's very, very old.  He's done our show three times.  And I've also seen him at the Friars Club when I did a fucking-  Oh, you're frying. 
[02:51:00]  Call me, you always get me.  Well, I did a roast and he's the roast.  He's like the head of the Friars Club now.  Just nothing.  Nothing, huh?  But meanwhile, he's still a very sharp guy when you talk to him.  It's not like he's a doddering idiot.  Right, right.  I don't know.  What is it about radio that when people look at you in a radio studio, they just don't understand?  Once you're out of the studio, they just completely forget who you are.  Maybe I should be wheeled around with fucking headphones on and a mic in front of me.  Well, I mean, Guy did it.  But it's what you do, I guess, if you're celebrities. 
[02:51:30]  Right, right, right.  Like, hey, when are we going to film that thing at your brother's restaurant or whatever?  Or Huntington in general.  I think he wants to maybe even try just doing Huntington in general.  Oh.  But now he's gone and I don't know how to get a hold of him.  And then you look like an asshole.  Like, hey, remember when you said on our show that you'd film?  You would look like the biggest asshole.  Get the motherfucker's number.  Remember you said we're going to film?  Well, I was wondering when that was actually going to happen.  Would you do that?  No, this is my favorite one. 
[02:52:00]  Hi, Quentin.  Remember when you said we could come to L.A. and watch movies at your house?  He actually invited us to movie night, whatever night it is.  It's a regular thing.  He goes, next time you're in L.A., we'd love to have you guys over for movie night.  Exactly.  Next time you're in L.A., just bang on the door.  Is it movie night, Quentin?  Yeah, you've got two girls blowing them on a sofa.  And the only, and the one time I did take the chance when I was in L.A., it was the famous  Greg Brady story.  Oh, boy.  Where I called him on the way to his house and said, hey, I'm coming over to say hi. 
[02:52:30]  And then, you know, it's a longer story, but then he...  Not since fucking Rupert Pupkin visited Jerry's house was a more awkward scene.  And then him and his wife looked, his wife at the time, looking in the refrigerator at  the leftovers to see what he could serve me.  Leftovers at fucking Greg Brady's house.  Were they eating or no?  Yes, he had a beautiful, like, nice, fresh pasta with a really nice-looking red sauce.  And me and my pal Jay had that pea sauce shit, that white sauce with the peas that he put 
[02:53:00]  over pasta, whatever that's called.  Well, you brought your friend.  That was bad.  That was in bad form because you should've went by yourself.  Because then he knows, like, your friend, and you're just going, hey, I know Greg Brady.  Let's go to his house.  I just wanted to, I wanted to, you know.  You should've went by yourself.  I wanted a buffer just in case, you know.  Oh, he's got any moves on you.  Can you imagine a guy bringing a buddy over to your house?  I'd fucking murder him.  The guy I wouldn't mind.  The guy I knew, but if some radio guy I knew called me, goes, yeah, hey, me and Chet 
[02:53:30]  are coming over.  It's cool.  It was Greg Brady's house on the top of the hill in Bel Air, overlooking everything.  You should've went by yourself.  In an area, just have martinis out on the deck.  That should've just been you, though.  Yeah, you don't bring Jay.  I gotta repost those pictures.  No offense to Jay, but you just go by yourself.  Yeah.  I took those pictures before Instagram.  I gotta find them.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  This house was ridiculous.  But then it turned out it was his wife's house.  His wife's house.  She was in international banking or something.  He had to go to Branson. 
[02:54:00]  For a minute, I really thought it was Greg Brady money that got him that house.  He had to go to Branson and do something.  There's a movie about Branson that's out now.  Yeah.  It's a trailer.  It's about something about the darker side of Branson.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I'm gonna watch it tonight.  That actually sounds cool.  It's on Apple TV.  There's somewhere to get it off of that.  But, yeah, it's like, well, Branson's been sold as this great family entertainment place  and stuff.  And then I guess the people that live there say there's a different story and it's a 
[02:54:30]  lie.  Really?  And it's got leaves.  I say when a movie's got leaves, it's pretty good, right?  Oh, yeah.  The little leaves that say, you know.  That look like parentheses.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, this one won this prestigious award.  And it's got leaves.  Look, more leaves.  The film festival.  South by Southwest.  I want to get leaves.  The film festival leaves.  Yeah.  You should put leaves, but then just like, because people don't read them and then just  write like it didn't win this award.  Right.  Not even nominated for this award.  Exactly.  Because no one, they just see the leaves and think it's great.  It's very ominous kind of a trailer. 
[02:55:00]  It doesn't show you much.  I mean, for people that come to the town as a tourist, I don't think they have a clue  how odd it is to live here and be a part of it.  Branson seems very simplistic on the outside, like you could paint it in a dozen sentences.  I think that you will find the surface truth doesn't match the actuality.  They're showing people clapping in the thing and people dancing, watching shows. 
[02:55:30]  The festive part of it.  Horrible shows.  Now they're showing something like boats and people dancing on stage.  That's the USA-Russia one.  Very patriotic.  Yeah, it looks fine.  Like this guy's at home just like playing a video game with his kid.  I guess they're going to focus on people that live there and perform.  It's like we always lie to strangers.  That's what it's called.  We always lie to strangers.  Yeah, they sure do.  I'm going to watch this tonight.  See what the fuck it's all about.  I'm right back.  I'm about to shit my pants.  What happened, Jimmy? 
[02:56:00]  All right, Lady Di.  Oh, Jimmy.  I had something for you, too.  It's hilarious.  I really had something for Jimmy.  I'm about to shit my pants.  Who says that on the radio?  It's crazy.  Holy cow, we say way worse.  I just mean like what radio host runs off saying I'm going to shit my pants.  I don't think Edward R. Murrow ever did that.  Sarah McLachlan.  Sarah McLachlan.  We know her as the poor little animal song girl. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, that's what her career has come down to, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  She talks about poor little puppies.  Yeah.  Please give.  These animals need your help.  Yeah.  Remember Patrice talking about this?  Oh, it was one of the greatest fucking descriptions.  You can find that.  Oh, my God.  Of this commercial ever.  The cat with the headache bag and the thermometer killed me.  The little kitten with the runny eye with the headache bag and the thermometer.  Yeah.  Poor little thing.  They show little crusty-eyed kittens. 
[02:57:00]  Although I realize that if you show an animal, even the happiest animal in the world, in slow motion, it looks like the saddest, poorest little thing.  You know?  Dogs do that thing where they'll like put the one eyebrow up and then they look slowly over the side and then the other eyebrow goes up.  You're like, what happened to the poor guy?  Poor guy.  But it's slow motion.  It's very deceptive.  Well, Sarah McLachlan changes the channel when her ASPCA commercial comes on.  She does, too, huh?  She's sick of it, too.  Wow. 
[02:57:30]  Anyone who has watched Basic Cable after midnight in the last seven years has probably come face-to-face with the two-minute-long heart-rending ASPCA commercial about criminal cruelty featuring singer Sarah McLachlan and her oft-caraoked song Angel.  Now, the Canadian songstress, she's from Canada, has a comforting message for those of us who reach for the remote.  We're not alone.  The commercial popped up repeatedly during McLachlan's Ask Me Anything session earlier today on Reddit.  But when one Redditor admitted that the commercial is such a bummer that the channel must be changed when it comes on, McLachlan confessed, I changed the channel, too. 
[02:58:00]  It's the kitten with the droopy eye or the three-legged dog.  Bless them.  It kills me.  The three-legged dog just grosses me out.  There are some animals that need to be put to death.  No.  But the little puppies and kitties, oh, feel bad.  Yeah.  A little runny eye, a little mangy thing.  And they show a little kitten, like, meowing, and it's going to be crusty around his nose. 
[02:58:30]  I go three-legged dog over paralyzed back legs dog.  Oh, where they do that acrobat thing where they hold their ass over their head and walk on their front legs.  Or they have to fucking put up the wheelchair.  Yeah, the weird dog wheelchair.  They put wheels on them.  Didn't we have, like, a two-legged dog come into K-Rock?  Yeah.  Was it two legs?  Yeah, he was just walking around.  Oh, it was so fucking sick.  It was pretty amazing, actually.  I don't need to have to look at that.  Yeah.  It's like just a walking depression thing. 
[02:59:00]  It's like, oh, that's right.  Now I'm not happy anymore.  Now I'm a little sad.  Right.  I don't like the sick animals roaming around.  Should we play the Patrice bit?  Oh, wow.  That's one of our old studios.  Faith, the two-legged...  Oh, my.  Which studio was that?  Oh, that was the K-Rock studio.  That was the K-Rock one, yeah.  Faith, the two-legged dog.  Oh, boy.  Why is he dressed in, like, a Department of Public's work vest? 
[02:59:30]  Some road work?  He's walking in the studio, and it's walking around, like, whoa, like a human being.  This is Faith, guys.  Two legs.  What?  This is Faith.  Hey, Faith, what's up?  That looks like a big hassle.  God.  A big hassle.  I didn't remember this until just this moment.  Poor dog.  I didn't remember this one.  It's got little chicken wing legs.  He walked for 15 seconds.  He's exhausted.  Now he's exhausted.  He got all his energy up, so the dog would walk into our studio on two legs.  On his two legs.  Cracked out Jude, Laura's mother, and... 
[03:00:00]  All these videos we tweet through our Twitter account, O&A Show, so...  The dog was left to die.  He was born with deformities.  Why the fuck?  I don't know.  They're going to tell the story tonight.  You've got to do the Sparta thing with the dogs like that when they're born like that.  Just push them off the cliff.  Right.  He's deformed.  Look, he's got a little chicken wing.  Little fucking buffalo chicken wing legs in the front.  It just looks stupid.  He's trying to wag his tail.  He's on his hind legs.  That would scare the shit out of me coming around the corner.  Of course.  Like, if I was walking down the sidewalk and that walked around the corner on his hind 
[03:00:30]  leg, I'd scream like a bitch.  That is scary.  Jimmy's still shitting.  And earlier we asked people to fix, Photoshop his Paul McCartney picture.  Right.  Because Jimmy doesn't really like his neck in the picture because he kind of did that  squishy neck.  He wrenched it to one side a little.  It's not even really officially a squishy neck, but he was in a weird position and kind  of had to push back a little bit and it made his neck look a little strange.  Or so he thinks. 
[03:01:00]  I don't even think that's bad.  It's that bad.  But Trev845 on Twitter came up with the best one I've seen so far.  Yeah.  It's Jim Norton with a noose around his neck to cover up his neck.  Jimmy would really appreciate that one.  That's a good one.  I wanted to show Jimmy.  I'm sure he'll see it later, but good job, Trev.  Why don't we leave and end with the Patrice bit?  I do like that one.  Right?  The little kitten. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  We did it.  You got it or does Travis got it?  Travis says he's got it.  Travis got a shorter version.  Travis has like a three-minute version.  Mine's three minutes, yeah.  And it is true.  There are Slobo t-shirts for sale.  And it has nothing to do with E-Rock.  My God, no.  You're actually making money off of something that he's expressed that he hates.  Yeah, but if I put his name on it, then that would be an issue.  Oh, boy. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, everybody knows that.  No, in the end, no one's going to remember that it was a whole E-Rock thing.  And that's just a cool shirt that says Slobo.  Well, if that's the case, then there was another question that the staff was asking earlier.  Yeah.  And is that, can you bring in shirts for everyone on the staff so we could all wear the shirt together one day?  Oh, would you like that?  We would all like that.  Yeah, Sal and Travis.  All right, make sure you get your sizes to me immediately.  Okay, great.  Great.  He wouldn't like that.  Well, it's not about, we'll get one for E-Rock, too.  It doesn't say E-Rock on it.  It just says Slobo.  It's just a fun word.  It's an old guy just shouting, Slobo! 
[03:02:30]  Right.  And it's selling incredibly well.  I think this t-shirt thing might be a thing.  So go get that.  It's on my website, opradio.com slash shop.  Hey, Jimmy.  Why are you all happy?  Look at this shit.  Who'd you get?  It's actual shit.  Oh, wow.  That is fucking a lot of shit.  That's a pot roast.  Yeah.  That was a lot of logs. 
[03:03:00]  Let me see again.  I know.  Let me see again.  Yeah, I call that a 30-logger.  Oh, man.  It's like the bottom of Mount St. Helens after the fucking eruption.  Yeah.  It looks like the Huck Finn's raft after it broke up.  It looks like a snake that just gave birth.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of baby snakes.  Here's the only reason I'm on the radio show right now.  Why?  I was going to enjoy my dump, and I like to zone out on the toilet.  Sure.  But I'm sitting on the last one, and again, it's wide open on everyone.  Some fucking asshole comes in and gets in the stall right next to me. 
[03:03:30]  That's so weird.  Why do people do that?  See, what's the matter?  Are you afraid you couldn't smell my shit from three stalls down?  That's a weird thing to do.  Asshole.  Jimmy, I just did it while you weren't here, but a guy really did fix your picture perfectly.  Fuck, now I can't find it.  Oh, no.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, B.  There it is.  Oh, I tweeted that.  Oh, okay.  That's so good.  The one with the noose?  Yeah.  Noose around your neck.  That's the best one that came in.  That is very, very funny. 
[03:04:00]  We're going to leave because we got a Patrice bit about animals.  Well, I first want to remind everybody, if you're going to be in the Long Island Patchogue area on Saturday, that's the 10th, this Saturday, me, my brother Joe, and my sister little Dorney, and Cowbell Bill and Joe Curry, a bunch of the guys, we're going to be performing a bunch of songs live right there at the Village Idiot Pub in Patchogue.  That's this Saturday.  Saturday.  I've got a wedding. 
[03:04:30]  At 9 p.m. in Patchogue.  I've got a wedding.  A wedding?  I would have went.  Damn.  For real, I would have went.  That would have been cool.  Yeah.  Get you up there with a tambourine?  Shake that shit around?  Give me any song.  I'll give you a tambourine.  And I could do a little.  Fuck.  And if you want to see me in Montreal July 24th or 26th, ha-ha-ha.com.  Three ha's.  Three.  I'm giving the keynote speech on the 24th, and then the Gisu Theater, it's a theater show at midnight, July 26th at midnight, I'm doing that show at the Gisu Theater. 
[03:05:00]  Three ha's.  People keep asking me about the Vice show and why it hasn't tickets, because we pushed it back.  It was a paperwork issue, a union paperwork issue.  Oh, boy.  But no, it's fine.  It was actually better that we do this, so it's going to be actually that we'll have a studio audience in June.  So it's happening.  Nice.  It just got pushed back by about three weeks.  Can't wait for that.  Very cool.  We've got lots going on. 
[03:05:30]  So we're going to end with a Patrice bit, talking about the Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty commercial, whatever.  And then, of course, the post-show with Sam Roberts.  Stay there.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice.  Good morning.  I have a feeling you might have something to say about the Michael Vick thing.  Because I remember when this whole thing went down, you were like, you guys don't understand the culture of what goes on.  I love dogs.  Love them more than people, as Bill was saying.  I love dogs.  I knew you'd have something to say.  Go ahead.  People who are vicious to animals bug me, you know, especially if you're up at four o'clock in the morning watching Isle of Lucy and Sarah McLachlan comes on. 
[03:06:00]  Showing a picture of a kitten with conjunctivitis and a fucking puppy smoking a cigarette with a fucking headache bag on.  If that motherfucker, if you don't feel bad for animals after you're watching a fucking watery-eyed kitten.  Dude, that is the fucking worst commercial.  And it's in between fucking Carole Burnett, fucking Guthy Ranker selling Carole Burnett and a Lucifer. 
[03:06:30]  And it's so long, the commercial.  And a fucking pit bull puppy missing a paw.  Snorting cocaine.  He has no home.  Now, if you don't fucking feel for an animal after you watch that, you're a fucking serial killer.  There's a one-eyed cat.  You're a hunk of shit.  If a kitten with a fucking pink eye doesn't fuck you up, you're a cocksucker. 
[03:07:00]  Look at it.  Look at it.  Turn this shit up, man.  I don't want to see that shit.  I don't want to see that, man.  We're watching the commercial.  The dog with the paralyzed back legs.  Oh, fucking Noah.  Oh, look at that.  What a bad boy he's been.  That dog looks so sad.  Look, it misbehaved.  Dude, I can't even look at that commercial. 
[03:07:30]  It ruins me.  I'm Sarah McLachlan.  Yes, bitch.  I spread peanut butter on my pussy.  Oh, yes.  Let the dog lick it off.  All she sings is sad songs.  I know.  And it gets sadder and sadder.  Bitch, kill yourself.  Throw a Frigbee to that fucking thing.  These poor animals, man.  That looks like a healthy dog.  Exactly.  The whole thing's about money.  It ain't about money.  A kitten with a headache is the worst thing ever. 
[03:08:00]  A fucking headache bag.  A fucking school cartoon headache bag.  And a cigarette and fucking deep thoughts and shit.  I don't need it.  Goddamn, Patrice.  I fucking love animals.  Oh, there's a three-legged cat.  Jesus.  Three-legged cat.  What's wrong with that dog?  That dog looks normal.  I don't know.  Look at more.  What's wrong with these animals?  They mostly look okay.  And how long is this fucking infomercial?  Forever this goddamn thing takes so long. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, but you don't know what these animals did to bother the owner.  They don't share the whole picture.  I refuse to look at it any longer, man.  The guy's fucking scrubbing his pots and pans with a kitten's eye.  Yeah, exactly.  Who are these people who hate animals, man?  I love animals, but I will punch a kitten squarely in the middle of its face.  If it muses while I'm watching TV, I will punch it squarely in its face.  If it muses.  Fucking assholes, man.  Dory Hyde and the stories, the backstage drummer. 
[03:09:00]  Everything that's made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  Now, now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the Opie and Anthony Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Yeah, it is.  Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Post Show.  If you want to be a part of it, you can call up now.  866-969-1969. 
[03:09:30]  That's 866-WOW-1-WOW.  Breaking down what is going to, what was a great show.  We're not going to break down what's going to be a great show.  We're going to experience it right now, here, on the Post Show.  Sal, when we ended the pre-show, you said something to me in confidence,  and I'm sure you won't mind me sharing it.  You said, I got a feeling today's going to be a great show, didn't you?  And I think my intuition was absolutely correct.  Now, you were outside with E-Rock when he slammed that cake into his face. 
[03:10:00]  Did you have any idea that was coming?  Did he say, this is my plan?  Absolutely not.  I would have been, you know, filming that with video.  I was only able to, like, snap a couple of shots with my camera,  but, like, he just grabbed it so fast.  I was like, what the fuck?  People, like, like, scream.  They, like, let out a little yell when he did it, you know?  Did you think it was just spur of the moment, or was he planning to do that?  It was absolutely spur of the moment.  I think he realized that they weren't live anymore,  so he's like, I got to do something to get on camera to make it, you know.  Like, he slammed, if you go, an ONA show on Twitter tweeted out the link, 
[03:10:30]  because it's part of the Fox and Friends after show.  They tweeted out the link, and he slammed that cake into his face.  Like, it looked like he had whiplash.  He slammed that cake into his own face so hard.  Yeah, it literally went everywhere.  It was with Hasselbeck who got whiplash.  Well, I don't think you can get whiplash in your arm,  but he almost took it out of the socket.  Yeah, you can't.  But, yeah, I mean, E-Rock almost gave himself whiplash.  His head snapped back.  And then, did he spike the cake on the floor when he was done? 
[03:11:00]  No, it just fell.  It was just, that's how hard he slammed it against his face.  It just went everywhere.  It went everywhere.  And all the tourists, so they're like, oh, look, God's here.  And then there's just, boom, cake everywhere.  Oh, I have no idea.  Well, let's find out what today's line of the day was, because I have no idea.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:11:30]  I think if someone would say penis to that question.  Yeah, I think.  And it would get a great laugh.  Steve Harvey could do his thing.  Yeah, it was a big family feud day.  It was a big.  I'm glad that those clips finally end up making it to the air,  because those family feud clips just sit around forever on the Internet.  Dennis, you're a big family feud guy?  It used to be when Richard Dawson used to host.  Those were your days, huh?  It was good.  He used to kiss everybody.  Yeah.  Come here, Roland.  Let me give you a smooch.  Ew, he used to put his arms around Roland. 
[03:12:00]  Now, are you not a fan of Steve Harvey as the host?  Is it a black thing?  No, of course not.  Steve's great.  Steve's a very successful radio host.  I mean, there's no doubt that he's...  It's fantastic.  All right, all right.  I just don't watch it anymore.  What's wrong, Iraq?  You look really disheveled.  Is it cake?  Cake in the...  Yeah, sugar high or whatever it is.  I don't know.  Yeah, it went into every orifice.  Yeah, my...  Was that a...  My face is burning a little bit.  From icing.  Yeah.  You slammed that thing into your face.  I broke the board that was under it. 
[03:12:30]  Like, foot fist way, you know, boom.  Yeah, why did you hit yourself so hard with that cake?  Adrenaline, probably.  Had to do something.  I guess, but it was like...  She ran by like...  Yeah.  Left arm.  So she ran by me like this.  Left arm up, holding the cake like a waiter would hold a tray.  I just went, yoink, and then poof, right across the face.  I told Sal, it looked like you hit yourself so hard it gave you whiplash.  No.  Because your head snapped back. </pre>
