<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show covered a wide range of topics throughout the broadcast.  It began with their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" promotion, mocking a rival show's "Flash Em Out Fridays" and recounting a story about potentially stealing the idea in Turks and Caicos.  Numerous listener calls detailed their "WOW" experiences.  The show then heavily criticized David Blaine's endurance stunt, with callers suggesting various disruptive methods, and expressed frustration with a botched Fox News car chase report.  In-studio guest Jimmy Norton was present throughout much of this section.  A caller, Dan, recounted his attempt to display a "WOW" sign at the Blaine stunt, leading to an encounter with security and a fabricated story about being an anthropologist for the New York Post.

The show next shifted to Mike Piazza's public declaration of heterosexuality, quickly transitioning into a lengthy discussion about Jimmy Norton's unusual sexual preferences, specifically his liking for chest kisses. This sparked a debate about the normalcy of this preference among the hosts and callers.  The hosts then celebrated high ratings in Boston, contrasting their success with Howie Carr's ice cream flavor discussions, all while continuing a running joke about "Rockhole" and featuring an Anthony-led Don West impression selling "22-year-old virgins."

The next significant portion focused on graphic sexual anecdotes and the upcoming Opie and Anthony Celebrity Softball Game.  Jim Norton recounted a masturbation incident in a car, leading to discussions of workplace masturbation and Norton's alleged exhibitionism.  The softball game discussion involved team selection, trades (including one involving Pete Radovich), and numerous calls, including a "Hi, Mom" segment about workplace masturbation.  Rich Voss and other unnamed guests participated, and the segment included detailed descriptions of sexual acts and encounters in peep shows, along with listener-submitted photoshopped images of the hosts and Eminem's reaction to the show playing his unreleased music.  Team selection for the softball game continued throughout the segment.

A subsequent segment centered on the celebrity softball team draft, where the hosts made ethnically-charged jokes and crude comments about potential players' appearance and athleticism, including a breast cancer doctor.  Gareth, an in-studio guest, was also teased.  The discussion included Barry Williams and strategizing about player selection, noting the absence of "Dice."  Don West then called in, discussing his career, sales techniques (including Beanie Babies), and a new wrestling pay-per-view venture.

The show then featured a lengthy interview with Steve the Whistler, interspersed with technical difficulties with the CD player.  Jim Norton's offensive jokes caused crew members to hide, leading to frustration from the hosts.  Despite the technical issues and Norton's behavior, the interview proceeded, featuring listener calls and more off-color jokes.  The show concluded with the "F.U." segment, announcements of upcoming guests Lewis Black and CeCe DeVille, and mention of unplayed "What I Learned Today" segments.  Steve the Whistler's website, stevethewhistler.com, was repeatedly promoted throughout his segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, this is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  And it is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  The greatest radio promotion ever.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Absolutely.  Shows all over the country trying to take the concepts.  Stupid Tom Lickass.  What does he call it?  Stupid Tom Lickass. 
[00:00:30]  What does he call it?  I don't even know.  He went on the other half this morning bragging about this new promotion he's got called  Flash Em Out Fridays, everybody.  Would you ever.  Look at it how brilliant I am coming up with Flash Em Out Fridays.  Well over a year after Anthony came up, Anthony and O.B. came up with Whip Em Out Wednesday.  He's such a toll.  Would you ever go on the other half?  No.  Would you ever go on that awful show?  No. 
[00:01:00]  Oh.  The Danny Bonaduce bag and.  That's what we say because we're not invited on any of these shows.  You know something?  We were invited on some Fox type show and some other thing.  Oh, they invited, they wanted us on one of those DJ shows.  Yeah.  It would be awful.  Imagine how you guys sit there with Dick Clark and Danny Bonaduce and that kid from Saved  by the Bell. 
[00:01:30]  No.  What the hell are you going to talk to the.  What?  No.  No.  Would you ever.  No, because we don't play nice.  We're not going to fake it.  But good old Tom Lickass on the other half today bragging about his little promotion Flash Em Out  Fridays.  We know for a fact that he started out way after we started with him out Wednesday.  Come on.  And we know where he got the idea from.  Yeah.  And he knows where he got the idea from.  We were broadcasting live from Turks and Caicos.  Caicos with Sam Adams and Jim Cook and the gang.  Yep.  They brought a bunch of us down to Turks and Caicos to broadcast for three or four days 
[00:02:00]  and we were doing wow all over the island and Lickass was there broadcasting as well  and took a really, really good idea back to L.A. with him.  Right.  And he knows it deep down.  He'll never admit it to anyone or his listeners, but he knows.  Of course not.  And we know, we know that he knows.  Yeah, but we stole something from him.  What was that?  Well, I took my ex-wife and I threw her in the fireplace and beat her with a Yule log, 
[00:02:30]  Opie.  There you have it.  So, we're not completely innocent.  But with that said, it is Whip'em Out Wednesday.  We love wow.  Oh, come on.  Now that the weather's getting warmer too, man, it's a beautiful day here in New York.  Beautiful.  It's just getting out of control.  The wow mail.  Yeah.  It's starting to look like the mail, I assume, like NSYNC gets.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they get this big mail bag and they just dump it on our desk in our office. 
[00:03:00]  And it's hundreds upon hundreds of letters every day.  Right.  With people trying to get their wow stickers.  That's one way to get them.  Then we'll send them out to you.  Right.  Another way is the sticker stops that go on on lovely, beautiful days on Whip'em Out Wednesday.  We're doing a sticker stop in the New York area.  Actually, Jersey today from 4 to 6, Spirits Unlimited, Route 88 and Bridge Avenue, Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  You can pick up your wow stickers today.  I think Melissa's going to be down there.  Oh.  Can't get down there?  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to us. 
[00:03:30]  We'll send one right out.  Very easy.  Right out.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And it's as easy as that.  And, of course, we love the homemade wow signs.  Of course.  A lot of the stations were on.  They had their own version of the wow stickers.  So there you have it.  And you should know what wow is by now, right?  Right.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  You put the wow in your car.  But then again, I don't know.  We're broadcasting in new cities almost every day, so maybe they don't know.  Oh.  Well.  You're going to be saying hi to a new city on Monday, by the way.  Yes.  I'm very excited about this. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  Well, any new people listening, it's easy.  You put a wow in your vehicle.  That's it.  That's all you do.  Some way, shape, or form, whether it's one of our stickers, whether you wrote it on a piece of cardboard,  you took electrical tape in your window.  So anyway, you put wow in your vehicle.  A girl drives by.  She sees the wow.  That's all you've got to do, by the way.  That's where your responsibility ends.  Now you drive.  All of a sudden, a girl sees the wow and goes, oh, I know.  That's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  And she will flash her lovely canage at you. 
[00:04:30]  And you'll go, what the?  What?  Who the?  How the?  Did this?  Hi.  And you'll go, oh.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  And then you move on when you're live.  Right.  Live.  You enjoy the glance, the look, and move on.  And you have won.  Our listeners, like Ant and I, are psychotic.  But we're cool.  Don't chase the ladies.  None of that crap, man.  No, it's a quick thing.  You look.  You smile with appreciation.  And move on.  Maybe give a nice nod or a thank you.  A little nod. 
[00:05:00]  Like whisper a thank you.  A thumbs up.  A thumbs up.  Or if you want to even go, yee.  Or maybe you make the old A-OK symbol.  Is that where you take your thumb and forefinger, make it in a circle, and stick the other three  fingers up and go, OK.  Look at Jim.  Jim's back with us today.  Jimmy.  He figured he'd give radio another shot today.  Yeah, what the heck?  What the hey-ho, I say.  When Jim feels like he stinks on our show, all of a sudden he just disappears for a day. 
[00:05:30]  Aw.  Is that what it is?  No, because I've been gone a lot more often.  So there you have it with the wow thing.  I'll tell you, when you go to the concerts and stuff during the summertime, that's where  the best wowing happens.  It's ridiculous.  When you're stuck in traffic on your way to the venue, people are flashing like crazy  if you've got the wow in your car.  It's a great big collection of people that enjoy this program and girls that like flashing.  So it's a perfect combination.  Summer concerts somewhere, you've got that wow in your vehicle. 
[00:06:00]  You're trying to find your way in or out of the parking lot after, before the show.  Usually that's a pain in the ass, isn't it?  You've got the wow in your vehicle.  Now it is a smorgasbord of bosom during your pain in the ass traffic ridden ride home.  There you have it.  Anthony, moving on.  We'll get back to the wow as the day goes on here.  We would like to have a girl come down here so we could send her to wow David Blaine, that  dopey magician, whatever he is.  Well, I just want to kind of fluster him. 
[00:06:30]  Knock him off that pedestal.  Whatever the hell he's on.  How great would it be for a drunk driver just to barrel into that thing and knock him over?  You know what we were talking about yesterday in the back office?  We're trying to figure out, you know, we have those amazing super soakers.  But we're thinking, you know, we figured it's not going to reach 10 stories, unfortunately.  It might.  Can we get a hose down there?  Fire hose.  Just have the fire department nail him with one.  We did get him with the voyeur bus, if you remember.  Yeah.  The voyeur bus.  You know, that was in an article that I read recently. 
[00:07:00]  Was it?  When he was talking about the ice trick he did about how a couple of girls, you know,  were flashing him.  Remember when he sent two girls to stand right in front of him and flash with the light stickers?  He talked about it in a recent article.  And when he was encased in that ice.  Yeah, we also drove the voyeur bus by him with all the naked girls.  And he was in that block of ice, and he looked and actually started smiling at the lovely girls driving by.  Right.  So maybe that'll work.  Well, Dan has been down at Bryan Park.  Dan, what's up? 
[00:07:30]  Hey, guys.  I held up the wow sign for you to show David Blaine.  And I have a tricked out Schwinn apple crate bike.  And check out this horn.  I popped that horn.  I held up the sign.  And security, his security came over and said I was ruining his concentration.  Oh, stop it.  I'm not kidding you, man.  They actually came over.  And I got interviewed by the Post, too.  Look, David Blaine, I mean, it's cute and all, but he's no Houdini.  Stop.  It's a trick.  Stop.  First of all. 
[00:08:00]  You don't need to concentrate to stand.  It's a trick.  And I don't believe he's just standing.  He isn't.  He holds onto these things on the side, and then he starts moving his feet.  He's got these, like, supports that he can hold onto on the left or right.  Where's that picture?  Oh, hold on there.  I can't figure this out for the life of me.  I heard that there's a brace running up his little pant leg, and he can actually use it as like a stool.  I think so.  Where he rests his weight on this thing.  I don't see any handles, my friend.  No, there are handles.  On either side, there are these metal pieces that come out from that column. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, and he holds onto those, and he, like, lifts his legs up and does other stuff so that, I mean, if he thinks he's going to fall, he just has to grab those things.  Yeah, in the paper, it says if it gets too windy, he can just grab onto these handles.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm trying to look for him.  That's no trick.  Yeah, I can stand there and hold something.  Right.  And if you're going to do it, you know, take your chances with the weather.  Why is this a big deal?  And the other thing, one other news alert card.  I hold onto things like that up and down the steps at the mall.  They never took my picture.  Who cares?  Right.  Go ahead. 
[00:09:00]  What, Dan?  Having people call in who are on the highway saying that they were, like, going to flash people.  Well, we're on Wednesday.  Everyone's promoting it for us.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you to whoever that was.  By the way, I told the New York Post later that my name was Anthony Comia, so she...  You see a story about a guy holding up the sign.  Did the Post really interview you?  Yeah, she did.  And she started asking what wow meant.  And I told her that I was an anthropologist and that it has iconography that goes way back 
[00:09:30]  and that when Thor Heidel went on the Contiki on Easter Island, they found wow, and she wrote  it all down.  And that was Anthony Comia, the anthropologist?  Yeah, yeah.  You're a pisser, man.  That's funny.  Dan, I'm putting you on hold.  Well, if that article's in the Post tomorrow, we're going to hook you up big time, all right?  Thanks, man.  You're funny.  Did you murder a teenager in Danbury?  Let's see.  Here's some of the biggest fears Blaine could be facing.  Pigeon droppings.  The runs.  An earthquake or hurricane. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, stop.  Heavy winds or rain.  How about mosquito bites?  Yeah, this doesn't seem like a real outrageous thing.  Houdini getting in a goddamn straitjacket, being shut in that milk container, the old  style metal milk container in chains.  That would be locked.  And then he'd get out of that.  That's amazing.  You know, when Blaine did the ice trick, I believe you and I talked about it, but you  know that's one of the oldest radio gags in America?  It's a wacky radio bit where the morning guy. 
[00:10:30]  They asked me to do it in Buffalo.  I was too scared to be confined.  But they said it was a piece of cake.  There's nothing to it.  What is the concept?  I would tell you that probably close to 100 DJs across America have done this.  Mostly the wacky zoo guys have done the ice trick where they've been in a block of ice.  What it is is there's enough room between you and the ice where it's an insulator.  Right.  It's actually warmer inside.  It's fine.  It's like an igloo principle.  What would be challenging is if you were laying down in the ice. 
[00:11:00]  Now your skin is touching the ice.  Touching the ice.  Now you would have some serious problems.  But there's just enough room between your body and the actual ice that it keeps you warm.  Yeah.  It was pretty toasty in there, considering.  I don't know what this guy is pulling off with this just standing on this thing.  And I can't believe the media didn't pick up on that.  That radio guys all over America have done this trick way before Blaine.  Hey, I did it.  Made it famous on national TV.  They couldn't find an iceberg big enough for me, but I wanted to do it. 
[00:11:30]  They've been burying DJs in coffins for many, many years.  Oh, please.  He did that trick as well.  They're all old little morning zoo, you know, radio guys.  Who are the bastards that dig the DJs up after you bury them in the coffin?  Just leave them there.  What a despicable occupation this is.  You know what's a great trick?  If you take your yam bag and you put it on dry ice and then you jump backwards quickly.  Oh, God.  Just first lightly moisten the yam bag so it sticks real good.  And the whole bottom layer of it and just the tip of the helmet. 
[00:12:00]  And just rip it back.  Jump back quickly.  Hey, you know, before we forget, Anthony, I hope he could say the same stuff he did in the back office there.  Reenact what you did in the back office.  Oh, as far as Fox, the Fox car chase.  I am so pissed off that I actually called Psycho Mark and yelled at his answering machine because he is the only one I know from Fox.  We're watching the news.  All right.  Breaking news. 
[00:12:30]  Well, I guess we'll talk about it a little if something happens.  But the Chandra Levy, perhaps they found her skeleton.  Speaking of which, on the instant feedback, Paul from Center Reach.  Yeah.  Looks like the Chandra Levy hide and seek game is over.  Hide and seek.  Good one, man.  Go ahead.  So they're running that.  All of a sudden, Fox breaks in.  There goes the picture.  It's a car, an SUV, being chased by a cop car, high speed, through a residential area.  And unlike the recent car chases, this was intense. 
[00:13:00]  The cop car was no more than three or four feet from the guy's back bumper.  Banging him.  He was banging him, trying to, you know, knock him sideways.  It was unbelievable.  The guy is skidding, and the cop is just, bam, bam, hitting him.  And then the guy starts pulling away from the cop.  He's going even faster now.  We're like, oh, my God, get it on the big TV.  So we turn on the big TV, turn the sound up.  Everyone's freaking out.  We jockey for our car chase positions, where we all get a good look,  because there's no blinking during the car chase, because something might happen.  We have sat through car chases that have taken hours. 
[00:13:30]  They had gone into this program and ended very boringly.  We wasted an hour and a half.  An hour and a half.  The guy pulled off the road and stopped his car in the middle of the road,  got out and laid down.  Wow.  It was nothing.  So we're watching, going, oh, cool, this guy's a maniac.  And they're cutting turns.  I mean, it was unbelievable.  And the anchor guy, or the news guy, goes, hey, this, the cops don't usually do this  unless there is an extreme danger to the community. 
[00:14:00]  They don't usually bang the back of the other guy's car.  They sit back and do the chases that we've seen a lot of.  Well, all of a sudden, they lose the signal.  We've lost the feed.  So we're sitting there.  And then they go, what the?  And then they go back to D.C. with some cop talking about the skeleton they found.  The skeleton in the women's clothing.  So we all freak out.  I'm just livid.  I'm looking at the television, just waiting.  All right, it's got to pop back on soon. 
[00:14:30]  You see the feeds go down from the copter every so often.  And then they get right back on and back to the chase.  They go back to what?  Well, apparently something's happened.  It seems the SUV the cops are chasing hit this other SUV head on.  Just a mess of vehicles.  People, like, thrown out into the woods.  The cops are dragging people out on the street.  Well, apparently something happened.  That's the chase they F up.  They got their guns drawn. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, guns drawn.  They're just bringing, like, injured people.  Nothing.  We missed it all.  Nothing.  We didn't see crap.  Fox sucks.  And I hate them.  I have a feeling they knew it was ending that way because they got the delay.  Yeah.  So then they go, oh, we lost the signal.  I don't know if something's wrong with the helicopter.  Exactly.  They want to show the head-on collision.  I will bet you money.  They're pussies over there at Fox.  Come on, have some balls.  Terrible. 
[00:15:30]  Have some goddamn balls.  All right.  Sean, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, that's not a stand going up David Blaine's leg.  It's a catheter so he can tinkle.  Yeah.  Even David Blaine has to tinkle.  Yeah, but you know what?  If you're going to do the stunt and you've got to take a leak, too bad.  Sucks to be you.  Do it in your pants.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  I guess, but it's a little less messy like that, I guess.  Yeah, but I mean, if you're claiming to be this almost supernatural type of guy.  Yeah.  You know?  Look at Tom C. from Jersey rubbing it in. 
[00:16:00]  Fox 11 LA stayed with it all the way and it was awesome.  You know what it's like?  Because that guy was flying.  When you see a head-on collision like that, ah, it's fantastic to watch.  Why would they cut that?  I don't understand why they would cut that.  Because they're pussies.  They're pussies.  They're faggots.  People want to see it.  I got to go to the phone.  I think we can pull this off, too.  Stefan.  Yeah.  Go ahead, man. 
[00:16:30]  I'll give it to you.  Go.  How are you doing?  Yeah, you guys could definitely put out a call.  For everybody who's got remote control airplanes, slam around David Blaine.  You get them close enough.  It would be like a King Kong thing going on.  Oh, my God.  It would be fabulous.  They're big, angry.  Hey, see you. 
[00:17:00]  Swatting at them.  How good would that be?  That would rock.  And those remote control planes, I mean, you could be a pretty far distance away.  Oh, yeah.  That would be fun.  Oh, my God.  Just watch them freaking out.  What could he do?  Fall.  You know what else someone's suggesting?  Huh?  That, um, how are you with a pitching wedge?  I'm pretty good.  Could you get it up that high?  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Take them out.  That's a piece of cake.  Imagine just, you put the ball down, look at the club. 
[00:17:30]  You're looking up at them, looking at the ball.  How nervous he'd get there.  How about a water balloon launcher?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Big slingshot.  God, there's so many cool things we could do with this guy.  How about a gun?  What would work better than a nice, maybe a tampon-coated bullet?  All right, calm down there, Jimmy.  There's nothing clever about what you're saying.  It doesn't matter how nice it would be just to watch his head blow off and watch that stupid,  arrogant body fall right in the middle of Brian Park, security rushes over, panicking. 
[00:18:00]  You know, it's been written up that he did a trick, a stunt, a whatever, on Carson's show.  And they're not sure if they're going to run it, which means, of course, they're going to run it.  What did he do?  They just want to get the press all over it.  Supposedly, he ripped it.  He took his heart right out of his body.  Oh, yeah?  Showed the audience, and there was just blood everywhere.  And then he just kind of disappeared.  I mean, meaning he left the stage and just vanished, kind of just went on his way. 
[00:18:30]  Didn't that guy do that in Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom?  Yes.  He would pull people's hearts out.  And doctors in the Philippines have been faking that for years.  Yeah.  Oh, we got the tumor here, and they press, and they have, like, something palmed.  Or, you know, if you take a sponge or something like that, you can make it pretty small in your hand.  Actually, they would use, like, chicken guts.  Chicken guts and stuff like that.  Yeah, and then they'd push, and they'd be palming a piece of it, and it would feel like he was, like, pressing into you and pulling out a tumor or something. 
[00:19:00]  You know who believed that?  Yeah, Andy Kaufman.  Andy Kaufman believed in that.  How sad.  I don't think he believed it.  I think he just wanted to give it a shot because he was dying.  Ah, you never know.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Give it a shot.  Pay a price for that type of brilliance.  Give it a shot.  I hear Mike from Middle Village saying, David Blaine's favorite trick is to make a 10-inch C disappear in his egg.  We don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Wow.  And it looks like Piazza's not into that.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Well, just that Mike had to say that.  Mike Piazza, I'm sure the whole country has heard by now, had to pretty much tell everyone that he's a heterosexual.  I wouldn't care if he was gay.  Who cares?  He's still the best hitting catcher of all time.  Catch literally if you want to.  Why on earth does that have to be put in the paper?  Or, you know, it's kind of like, why should the guy have to defend himself like that anyway?  You know what I mean?  If he wants to suck it, who cares?  Who cares?  Exactly. 
[00:20:00]  Maybe when Eddie Trunk is playing some Slayer, if he wants to come over here at night, give him a little Hummer.  Yeah.  Whatever.  What is it our business, what he does?  Yeah.  Maybe it was a tranny he picked up, and he's like, you know what?  I'm going to be a team player.  It's not gay if you're just doing it to reciprocate.  As he's getting a handy from some tranny.  Hey, you don't get much for a dollar these days.  You do with 10-10-2-20.  But Piazza's saying, I'm not gay today.  I'm not gay.  Hey, Ken in Virginia, what's up? 
[00:20:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Oh, you're the guy that does those sticker stops for us.  Yes, that's right.  And I got another one today for y'all.  All right.  I'm down here in Stafford, Virginia.  Oh, Stafford.  Yeah, it's kind of like everybody calls it the redneck area.  Right.  So, I'm down here off of 610, or Garrisonville Road, in the Walmart Shopping Center, right off I-95.  And I've got plenty of stickers this time. 
[00:21:00]  How many do you get?  How many is plenty?  Probably about 200.  Oh!  That's the last time.  Yeah, how many did they give you last time?  About 100.  This guy does his own sticker stops.  He goes to the station.  He goes to the station, right?  Right.  And he says, give me a bunch of stickers.  I'm doing a sticker stop.  What a great fan.  You know?  The guy just takes it upon himself to grab a bunch of stickers and go out and do a sticker stop.  The thing is, I think he's setting up for the point where he does the big one, and they  give him boxes and boxes, and then he just leaves and sells them. 
[00:21:30]  Not a bad idea.  Buck a piece.  All right, Ken, have fun with that today, all right?  Thanks, gentlemen.  Okay.  And, Ken, if you see a Sprint phone office, please feel free to slide a pipe bomb under the door.  Hey, hey.  I'm using Sprint.  They stink.  I hear you.  All right, thank you.  Yep.  Well, we've got to take our first break.  Yes.  We've got some good news today.  Oh, my God.  Ratings for Boston came in.  We'll give you the details next.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus. 
[00:22:00]  It's getting pretty ridiculous up there as well.  Just when you thought, you know, you look at the last city that comes in, Philly and whatnot.  We're on a good roll.  New York took care of us.  Philly took care of us big time.  And it looks like Boston took care of us as well.  Yeah.  Ratings for Sacramento come in in about a half hour.  We'll see.  We'll see what happens there.  Also, and as we go to break, today's a huge day for the program.  Don West is calling the show finally. 
[00:22:30]  Don West.  Don West.  We're going to be selling cards.  Cards.  What's he doing now?  He's doing some wrestling announcing.  Yeah.  It's going to be a pay-per-view.  Yeah.  And he's announcing he's going to be like the third man in the booth.  We love Don West.  I cannot wait to get him on the phone.  I want to ask him about that goddamn shop at home.  I want to ask him about the eight billion frigging rookie cards of Meguiers that he's sold.  Wonderful.  This is a treat for me today. 
[00:23:00]  A personal treat.  You know, as we go to break, we got to.  You're going to be crazy if you're tuned away.  You're a mad person.  We got to play Anthony doing Don West.  Dang.  Selling someone's virginity.  Virgins.  You got that one, bro?  All right.  Don West calling in in the five o'clock hour.  Could be the 520 bit today.  We'll see.  But as we go to break, here's Ant doing a great impression of Don.  Hey.  What do you think the QVC guy sounds like?  Selling virgins or 22-year-old virgins?  We talked about the guys from QVC before. 
[00:23:30]  They're always selling the Beanie Babies and memorabilia sports stuff.  Yeah.  They have the tough sounding voices.  One guy yelling all the time, virgins, 22-year-old virgins.  Order now.  These are going to go fast.  Look at this one.  Let's bring it up.  Let's open her up.  We like to do this every so often.  You're not going to find anything better than this, people. 
[00:24:00]  Limited time.  And you get a Mark McGuire rookie card with everyone.  22-year-old virgin McGuire rookie card.  We're giving them away $22.  That's a dollar a year.  22-year-old virgins.  Look, I can't get anything in here.  We're talking. 
[00:24:30]  You won't be able to tell the difference between the front or the back.  It's like two balloon knots.  Wow.  What the hell?  And you get Flopsy Wopsy, the Beanie Baby, that's been discontinued since 92.  A McGuire rookie card, a Sosa rookie card.  And a 22-year-old virgin.  They're going to go fast, people.  Look, I'm trying. 
[00:25:00]  I can't get anything in here.  Take it home.  Work it.  Limited edition.  Did you hear?  Limited edition.  For the love of God.  This young lady is flashing her privates.  Whip them out Wednesday with Obi and Anthony.  A bunch of girls flashing their boobs, which is cool.  Wow! 
[00:25:30]  The Obi and Anthony show.  1027-WNAW.  I'm not dying for it.  Setting this out to David Blade, everybody.  Stand alone.  Everything that I believe is fading.  I stand alone.  If I die.  Stand alone.  God smacked. 
[00:26:00]  I stand alone.  We're back with the Obi and Anthony show.  Busy, busy day.  Nice.  Thank you, Boston.  Oh, yeah.  You want to go there?  So we got a little ratings thing for Boston.  And holy S.  It's ridiculous.  Holy S.  I don't know what else to say. 
[00:26:30]  It's just...  It's amazing.  And thank you, Boston.  It's so ridiculous that the bigwigs up there are saying,  well, let's hope it's not a fluke.  Oof.  Oof.  Leaps and bounds.  It's so scary, the ratings in Boston for this month,  that they don't know how to deal with it.  Yeah.  They're confused.  They don't know how to measure it.  They're just really freaked out today.  So thank you, Boston. 
[00:27:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Amazing.  Let's just put it in terms that people can understand, okay?  Okay.  For the month of April, Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show in Boston  is the most listened to show on WBCN.  Oh, really?  Is the most listened to show on WBCN for the month of April.  With no exceptions?  No exceptions.  No exceptions.  More people are listening to Opie and Anthony on WBCN than any other show.  Than any other program. 
[00:27:30]  On WBCN.  A fact.  Wow.  Wow.  And there's only one man that stands in our way.  Yeah.  And that is Howie Carr.  We're nipping at his heels.  That's who we're gunning for.  He's the next guy we take down in Boston.  Everyone else is so far back in the mess now.  Oh, long gone.  Long gone.  Way in the rearview mirror.  It's not even close.  I was looking at what it looked like last year. 
[00:28:00]  All the numbers, what it looked like last year.  And kind of reading it down.  And then when we came to town and, you know, we were jockeying for that position.  All right, we're going to do this.  We're going to win.  We're going to do this.  Now you look at the latest one that came out.  It was like, huh, not even close.  No.  And it's all thanks to the fine people of Baston, Massachusetts.  A lot of new listeners and a lot of the old ones that didn't forget us.  What happened?  Nothing.  I said Massachusetts. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, who is Howie Carr, by the way?  He does like more conservative talk.  All right, with the conservative talk.  What's the matter?  Make up your own minds already, people.  Stop.  You don't like the conservative talk.  No, it was over for me.  September 30th, I was done with conservative talk.  A few weeks.  All right, but now just form your own opinions and read the paper.  We're going to need some old curmudgeon telling you what to think.  We're going to have a tough time beating him, though, because I remember once driving  to Cape Cod and I was listening to Howie, and he had a whole discussion on ice cream 
[00:29:00]  flavors.  Wow.  Really?  And people had to call up with their favorite ice cream flavor.  Oh, how about that?  And it went on for about an hour, so I don't know if we could match wits with Howie Carr.  That's tough.  When you're listening to the car, you're thinking, well, someone quick, say pistachio,  but then nobody does.  Oh, because that's my favorite.  Yeah, and I hate when they don't mention my favorite.  Yeah, it was intriguing.  Wow.  It was really good.  Wow, that's something.  I'm not even kidding.  That's what I heard. 
[00:29:30]  And every flavor was mentioned.  Wow.  Rocky Road?  Rocky Road?  I bet not, right?  We can only wish we were as good as Howie Carr in the talk forum.  Hey, Howie.  I love the show.  You're doing the thing about your favorite ice cream flavors today.  I've got to say strawberry.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, strawberry rolls.  Is that it?  Unfortunately, Howie's favorite flavor should be bullet flavored. 
[00:30:00]  It stinks.  And by the way, can I just throw a quick shout out to the Sprint lady who hung up on me today  because I was screaming at her.  I hope you have a miscarriage at your own baby shower.  I hate you.  Wow.  There's a picture of good old Howie.  He looks like, what is it?  That's Howie, man.  It's going to be tough to beat.  I'm telling you guys right now.  I don't think we have the talent. 
[00:30:30]  Ernie from Jersey said I went through.  Oh, it did?  I missed something.  Dude, look.  What?  Read that.  Nice.  That's good.  Hi, who's this?  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hey, AF.  What do you want to hear?  Hey, Rockhole.  What's going on, Dopey Unfunny?  Comic I've never heard of.  Used open for dice. 
[00:31:00]  You don't sound too enthusiastic anymore.  Yo, wait till you hear what I'm enthused about.  All right.  Is this something that's going to...  Rockhole.  Here's how the ratings are.  Rockhole, wait a minute.  Is this something...  No, you wait a minute, I'm funny.  No, you wait a minute, Rockhole.  Is this something that's going to help you out?  Because you are so far in the back of the pack now, it's ridiculous.  Help me.  I'm going to overtake Howie Carr.  Listen to this.  I'm getting on top of the AAF building.  Yeah.  Going to stand up there for four weeks with only Dave's mule as a brace. 
[00:31:30]  I think you're on to something this time, Rockhole.  The only problem is, for it to be a real brace, I have to give it a rub and tug for about 40 minutes.  Hey, Rockhole, I was checking out your latest pictures.  Yeah, how do I look?  It's a cute picture of you in a bubble bath.  You know.  What were you going for with that shot?  Well, just the men, basically, as my demo.  Trying to get a couple of guys to come on down. 
[00:32:00]  Maybe a couple of bi-curious fellas.  Sit in the hot tub with you?  The hot tub.  Maybe have a little beach party this summer.  Yeah, all right.  I don't know.  Drink a couple of margaritas.  You know, guy drinks.  Well, good luck to you on your latest thing.  You're going to stand on Dave's mule like David Blaine.  Well, the original was to put a clothespin on my nose and see how long I could have it in my mouth.  Without, you know, suffocating.  Right.  But we thought that was way too over the top. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I'm not that edgy.  I mean, I'll say chicken butt every now and again.  Did Dave come up with this idea?  No, it was all me.  You're lying now, aren't you, Rock Hole?  Yes, I am.  All right, Rock Hole.  Well, it was good to talk to you douches again.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  Maybe next book, Rock Hole.  Hey, Rock Hole.  Yeah.  We can't really spend much time with you anymore because you're really, really in the back of the pack.  Yeah, now it's not even like you're close that we have to even mention you.  And we like the Rock Hole character. 
[00:33:00]  Maybe Rock Hole could turn into the Howie Carr character.  All right.  Let me get some tapes of him and work on the voice.  Good job.  Yeah.  Well, I guess this is it for me.  No.  Well, no.  We'll have you on from time to time.  I'm going to work on like a French voice or something.  I don't know.  All right, Rock Hole.  Sunk it.  We don't want to burn you out.  Yeah, I don't want to burn me out of you later, too.  Well, it looks like you're very burnt out as far as Boston goes.  That's horrible.  Poor Rock Hole. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, the ratings are just terrific.  That guy is.  And I will use the word terrific today, Jim.  They're unbelievable, actually, in Boston.  Unbelievable.  If Dave put the Rock Hole character on, then we'd have something to worry about.  Yeah, we'd be in trouble.  Because that guy is goddamn funny.  We'd be in a lot of trouble, right?  Mark from the NYPD.  What's up, Mark?  Yeah, it's not exactly NYPD, but it's in northern New Jersey.  It just got wowed by four beautiful black chicks.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I'm driving along in my patrol car, my 3-11 shift, and four girls are there at the 
[00:34:00]  light.  I'm kind of in the industrial area, so it's not exactly out in the middle of the avenue.  But all of a sudden, girls looked at me, and up popped the shirts, and out popped the  McGuffeys.  There you go.  Nice.  It was awesome.  It was awesome.  Works like a charm.  See?  All right, Mark.  I could etch my name in glass right now.  It's pretty awesome.  Very nice.  Well, congrats to you, Mark.  Thanks a lot, man.  You guys are doing a great job.  All right.  Yeah, wow is happening all over the place in New York today. 
[00:34:30]  Lucky guy.  It's like fishing, though.  You know, that guy just called about a big catch.  He just had a big catch, Opie.  He had the bait on his car, the wow.  Some guys, maybe they don't get lucky this Wednesday.  They put the pole out there.  They're fishing, and nothing happens.  But maybe next week, that'll be your week.  You might have to change your bait.  Might have to change the bait.  Might have to snazzy it up a little bit.  Or you do what they do sometimes, which is take a bat and just start beating the fish  in the water.  That always works.  You are horrible, Gordon. 
[00:35:00]  Just because Sprint pissed you off.  I know.  Jimmy gets mad at one thing, and the world has to pay for it.  Come on up on me.  I really, really hope she's killed in a drunk driving accident.  Nathan.  Yeah.  What's up?  Not too much.  Love you guys, but I've got to defend Howie Carr a little bit here.  All right.  Before I discovered you guys, I listened to him for a long time up here in Boston.  Yeah.  And that ice cream flavor thing, sure, he does stupid stuff like that every now and then.  But you guys know with the big dig and the political situation up here, like, what a 
[00:35:30]  mess it is, right?  Of course.  He knows all that stuff so well, and when he gets into goofing on that stuff, he is hilarious.  All right.  I mean, I really, uh...  Nathan, we're trying to tell you that we could only wish we were as good as Howie Carr.  I know.  Yeah, unfortunately, I can read inflection as well as your words, so...  Who wouldn't want four hours of big, big humor jokes?  Oh, but James Swift, James Swift, the twin-bearing female governor who's now leaving.  Yeah, we know.  Yes.  We know all that. 
[00:36:00]  There's only so much you could say, though, Nathan.  Oh, all right.  Hey, look, that's cool.  We hope someday to be as good as Howie.  Whatever you're into.  Yeah, we're nipping at his heels.  Who knows what will happen?  Well, hey, what can I say?  You guys stole me from him.  Oh, thank you, Nathan.  Well, that'll help us.  Thank you.  All right.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, mister.  Doesn't he?  The only funny conservative talk show guy is Bob Grant, and it's because Bob Grant was  genuinely wanting to stab half the people that called him.  Yeah, for the people outside of New York, the guy was the real deal.  And he's syndicated now.  He's a little nicer. 
[00:36:30]  He used to tell old ladies he wanted to punch them in their teeth and stuff.  Shut up, you buffoon.  They'd call up and just, if you went against them, Howie, I don't like the way you talk  about the black community.  Shut up, you savage.  You're all a bunch of savages.  And that mayor of New York, he's a washroom attendant.  He called David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor.  He used to call him the washroom attendant.  He does nothing. 
[00:37:00]  He caters to the savages where there's a shooting and a police officer is shot.  Where is the savage mayor?  Nowhere to be found but a svachim.  Drug dealer gets shot and he's bedside with that animal.  And you'll listen and go, oh my God, this guy's out of his friggin' mind.  I heard a gay guy call him one time.  This is the greatest thing I've ever heard a guy say.  The gay guy was yelling at Bob Grant.  Oh my God.  He got through. 
[00:37:30]  He didn't go through.  He wanted to use his fist to punch Bob in certain areas.  Okay.  Hudler.  Right, hudler.  And Grant said, you know, this time next week, I hope you come down with a full-blown case  of the virus.  Click.  That's expected from me or Voss or you.  Right.  But not a conservative talk show.  It's the greatest thing.  And he meant it.  Yeah, he was the most nasty curmudgeon.  But they kind of tamed him down.  Of course they did.  After he said that about Ron Brown.  Yeah, Ron Brown, who died in that plane crash. 
[00:38:00]  And he kind of had some things to say about him.  And then he got in trouble.  Before they knew he was dead.  What did he get in trouble for again?  Ron Brown got in the plane crash.  And yeah, before they found his body.  They didn't know if he was dead or not.  Bob Grant said, I think he is dead.  But then again, I'm an optimist.  And I love Bob Grant.  Disney owns, I think, NBC.  Yeah.  Of course.  And it's amazing how many talk show hosts get fired for saying something about a black 
[00:38:30]  guy that's inappropriate.  I know.  When was the last time it was, you know, went the other way?  Why can't we get him on here in New York?  Bob Grant's on in New York.  Oh, I mean, move him over here.  Move him right here to this station.  Oh, dude.  First of all, he would not tolerate the antics of this program.  Welcome that miserable old bastard.  Any day of the week.  He wouldn't make eye contact with you in the hall.  Who cares?  We don't make eye contact with half the shows already.  Whip him out Wednesday.  These slobs that you bring down.  What's the money snatch?  The slobs you brought down. 
[00:39:00]  Well, some of them were hot.  They know who they are.  The greatest.  I really love Bob Grant.  That's cool.  Omar, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Omar.  I really liked your idea about taking down David Blaine with little planes.  Well, I got one.  Do you want me guys to come down and shoot at him with my little darts?  I don't know.  Not even the size of the plane or anything.  I don't like your voice and people talking about planes flying into things.  You're scaring me, Omar.  Oh, my.  Oh, come on.  Yes.  My name has to do with anything, man. 
[00:39:30]  First of all, I'm French, amigo.  You're French.  We were joking earlier that it would be kind of funny if we, you know, flew some planes.  Like, you just have just little, like, plastic bars that you can, like, shoot out.  All right.  So don't be funny.  Shut up.  Come here.  Femme la bouche.  He's cursing.  He doesn't like what I'm saying.  No, he doesn't like that.  I was doing a Frenchie on him.  Hey, Scott.  Scott from Boston.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I just wanted to give you guys a call.  Alex Beam put a piece in the Globe yesterday. 
[00:40:00]  Boston Globe?  Yeah.  Listing all the talk show hosts in Boston and how O'Reilly's coming in and he's going to have trouble.  Yeah.  But they got everyone in here.  Barnacle, Rush Limbaugh, some guy named Jay Severin who I've never heard of.  Yeah.  Howie Carr, Laura Ingram, and David Brudnoy.  And you guys aren't even mentioned at all.  Ah, you know something?  The Globe hates us.  And we love it.  They can suck it because it's going to get to a point that they're going to have to say something. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, they got Howie Carr in here talking about another one of those wacky bits.  Tell me your worst driving experience.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  The only time that's funny is if Joseph Gray calls in.  Or if Menino calls in.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  I'm punching out.  Looks like we're going to have to really work on this show to beat Howie, I guess, Ant.  And by the way, enough with Bill O'Reilly. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  I've had enough of him.  There's the guy that just, you know, cuts to the brass tacks.  Enough of his talent like it is, guy.  His radio show stinks.  The no spin zone.  His radio show stinks.  I ask the tough questions.  Do you really bore?  He's finding out that it's not easy to do a radio show.  There's enough of him.  It's awful.  I believe he has a piece of ass sidekick, though.  He's got like some blonde chick.  Of course.  Yeah, because that has to balance it out.  Yeah.  That's why the show stinks. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  That's why you won't see Ant and I with a female in here.  No, it's because you can't get one to come down.  You don't have to ask you to have one.  No, but you can't focus and concentrate on being an idiot.  We don't need no bitches as sidekicks.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  Dude, I mean, I'm very rarely effective as it is.  I'm completely ineffective when there's a girl in the studio.  I'm the worst.  I can't concentrate.  Because you molest them.  I can't help it.  And you juggle their breasts.  I'm a dirtbag.  And you run out of here and grab the telephone and try to make appointments with them. 
[00:42:00]  You bet I do.  Hey, look, there's nothing wrong with paying for it.  That's just giving back to the economy.  This is as locker room as it gets.  Can I tell everybody what one of the headings were on your email when I looked over your shoulder and saw the subject of one of your emails?  Large, tasty sea.  And it was the sea, oh, you know, for mule.  And it wasn't cobbler. 
[00:42:30]  Large, tasty sea.  It was from some girl.  And I guess she had enjoyed your tasty sea.  You've got to love adjectives.  The guy is amazing.  God bless you, Jimmy Norton.  You know what it is?  It only happens once with every girl, though.  Because as soon as...  They actually will go through with it once we hang.  But then they never want it again.  Because they get a look at my torso naked.  They're like just...  I like my nipples played with.  And that's not...  You don't have to dump out of that.  That's not dirty.  I like my chest area kissed. 
[00:43:00]  Do you?  Yeah.  But it's hard when you're doing certain things.  Because if you're in an arms propped up position, they dangle like udders.  Oh, my God.  And there's just nothing sexy about it.  Why do you like that area kissed?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  But when I'm...  Out of all the areas, there's other ones that are much better.  I love them, too.  That's not a popular thing.  Yeah, it's half and half.  I always ask a gal, and I do...  Jim, I could...  We could take a quick survey and interview 100 guys.  And I'll tell you, less than...  Forty would say yes. 
[00:43:30]  Forty percent would say they like that area kissed?  I'm going to guess.  No way.  For me, it just makes me whole.  Like, if you're bleeding, I love getting Hummers and getting the balloon knot done.  Everything.  But, man, when I got a little tweaking up there, gently, not too tough.  I don't know.  You know what?  Does it for me.  If you add it into the entire picture, because I think any guy can appreciate being touched  or whatever everywhere, you know, just hand, chick hands all over you, fine.  But to then focus on that area is a little feminine, Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  No, it's not.  I find that a little feminine.  Look, if I said I want you to do that and call me mommy and cram something into my balloon  knot, if I said that again, that would probably be feminine.  But that's not feminine to, like, your chest area kissed and...  Mama, I want nini.  Exactly.  There's nothing...  Yeah.  Dude, that's just homophobic.  It's my body.  No, it's a little...  It's a little feminine.  It's a little weird, Jimmy.  No, it's not.  And I like the balloon knot service properly.  That's not feminine.  You like your balloon knot service.  Jimmy, you know it's a little weird. 
[00:44:30]  You're trying to convince everyone.  It's a little weird.  No, right?  Yes, it is.  It's not as common to like that area.  For that area to be so erogenous, it's not as common for men, but that's not weird.  But it's...  No, I'm not saying weird or anything.  I'm just saying...  It's just feminine.  He's over there calling me a Peter Pumper.  I'm saying feminine.  No, I'm not saying that.  It's just not the norm.  It's just...  I don't know.  Dude, but I'm getting treats.  Yeah.  And Dice watched me one time through a hotel door and laughed at me for a month.  Look at him go.  He said I was the worst and my feet just went out straight.  He's like, you don't move. 
[00:45:00]  What comics haven't seen you naked and just going at it?  I really am a disgrace.  But I'm just tweaking.  I'm just gently rubbing and giving them a little...  Yourself.  Yeah.  That is sick and twisted.  No, it's not.  It's great.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  It's great.  If a girl is doing something to you and you're taking your own fingers and tweaking yourself...  Yeah.  ...and rubbing...  No.  It's not feminine.  That's feminine.  No, it's not feminine.  That is very girlish.  If she goes there, I'm not going to get all freaked out, but it's not like, you know, when  you submerge, when you submerge on a lady and you look up and she's going at her own upper 
[00:45:30]  section with her hands, that is amazingly effing hot and it is very feminine.  Nope.  If a girl looked up and she's, like, servicing and looks up at Jimmy, feeling himself up...  Tweaking himself...  No, but it's not...  Dude, stop it!  I'm not massaging and kneading.  I'm just touching with my little pointer finger...  No, I'm not...  Like that.  Like that.  You've been firmly grabbing her hair. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, please.  I didn't say...  I could do one with both chest things and then grab hair with the other and then slap  and go right back to it.  Oh, my God.  That's very girl-like.  I've had girls actually look up, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, and then this is what they say.  I'm making an awful face and I'm tweaking.  And tweaking.  Tweaking.  You know what's even more awful?  The phones have exploded and everyone is saying, I'm with Norton.  I'm telling you, men...  Not all guys, I don't think.  My best girl is that weird.  If a girl is running her hand up your chest, down your stomach, your sides, your neck and 
[00:46:30]  everywhere and then brushes your chest because she's, like, doing everything, that's fine.  But if you're sitting there yourself and tweaking and feeling, it's a little odd, Jimmy Norton.  Dude, it's mine.  I'm not saying, look, I want to get a snowball from her or a felcher fellow.  No, I'm saying that I want, you know, come over and kiss me after you're done with the  gardener.  No.  I'm saying that when a girl, a girl, is making a treat, I like to give the old thing. 
[00:47:00]  I find that just a little strange.  It's not.  There's nothing strange.  All right.  All right.  Glenn, real fast.  All right.  What do you got on this, Glenn?  No, you're...  Well, don't say it like that.  Just say tweaking.  We know what they're tweaking.  Glenn basically thinks it's awesome when a girl's tweaking.  I'm tweaking you.  Or I'll do it myself, or if she'll do it, whoever wants to do it, hey, thank you.  I don't get this one.  We're way off on this one, Ann. 
[00:47:30]  Mike.  I guess.  Mike, hey.  Yo.  Real fast.  What do you got?  Oh, hey, man.  I'm with you, Norton.  Definitely.  That's great.  Have you tweaked your own?  That's a little odd for me, you know.  I don't know about that.  Thank you.  But, and I'm definitely with Anthony, when you're downtown and you're looking up and  you've got that perfect picture right in your face of her doing her, it's a beautiful  thing, man.  See?  Yep.  It doesn't get better than that.  Now, quickly, get that mind in your head and put Norton's face there. 
[00:48:00]  Oh!  Hey, if you can see me doing it over my mule, good for you.  Dude, you guys rule, man.  Hey, thanks, Mike.  Later.  Another guy with Norton, uh, Anthony.  Yo.  What's up?  Real fast.  Love it, man.  Love it.  Love it when the girls tweak, man.  They're thumbing the forefinger.  But not hard, though, dude.  No, no, no.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Light little brushes.  Light little, lovely brushes.  Exactly.  Just a little touch.  You know what? 
[00:48:30]  And it don't work when you do it yourself, man.  It feels all kinds of screwed up.  See?  No, but I will do it to myself if, um...  Oh, I can't do it to myself, but I'll tell you, man.  You know, you try to force your hands there.  No, I'll tell him.  Just touch me.  Just touch me.  I have been standing here when we've had hot action going on in this studio with girls  on the floor going at it or whatnot.  Jimmy has one hand, like, on his pants, and he's working that.  And I've seen him lightly brushing his upper area with his middle and index finger gently 
[00:49:00]  circling.  And I look at him and just go, ugh.  Well, you're supposed to look at me and go, ugh, as do most chicks.  I've seen it, but it's just like, you're lightly touching.  You're the first guy I've ever seen work his own junk in front of other guys.  It is the weirdest thing.  And you know who warned us about that was Dice.  But I don't do it.  When we first met you, Dice goes, the guy is a sex addict, and he will work his own junk  right in front of you. 
[00:49:30]  And Dice goes, but he's not gay.  Not at all.  It's just what he does.  I do it with, I'm talking about chicks, I think about chicks.  I don't just look at Ant in that shirt.  No, I know, I know.  But it's still weird.  You like the shirt, Jim?  I do, actually.  Thank you.  Now that I say it, let me correct myself.  But if any other guy in this room is turned on by some of the, you know, the girl stuff  that's going on, none of us are going to be working our own junk.  Have you ever heard of where there's a phone call going on, and you just hear like, ugh.  No, he goes, ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:50:00]  And while he's doing that, people, if you do hear, ugh, he's working his lower half,  his upper half, he's working.  But let people know, I'm not yanking it out, it's in.  You're very close to that.  If I could get away with it, you bet I would.  You push down and pull up all the time.  Can I ask you something?  Sure.  All right, during the course of the show, you've been doing it with us for a while now?  Yeah.  Have you been so turned on by something going on in the studio with the chicks that you  had to go and do something? 
[00:50:30]  Nope, absolutely not.  Would I have?  Sure.  I have.  No, I mean with yourself.  You're like, you know what, I can't take this anymore.  I've got to go take care of business.  No.  The only time I did that where I got...  Did you come close?  No.  One of my first comedy gigs ever I did, I actually did it in the back of Bob Levy's car while  Florentine and Levy were in the front seat.  Honest to God.  No, no, no.  I was in full whack.  Let me tell you something.  Bob Levy is another mental patient that he knows.  Yeah.  He's like on the same line as a boss and all.  I'm in comedy six months.  A real quick story.  We're in Connecticut doing a gig. 
[00:51:00]  And I was with a girl and she's rubbing my leg under the table.  This is my first piece of comedy girl ever.  Wow.  And I stunk and I would open it with a joke joke and then, you know, at the end I would  do a joke joke.  I was awful.  And she's rubbing my leg.  Yeah.  And I've never been that sexually frustrated.  I couldn't do anything because her brothers were there.  Oh, God.  And she was maybe three and a half.  She was horrible.  You know what she looked like?  A warthog.  She wasn't fat, but she had the face of some type of a wild hog.  She was awful, but she was rubbing my leg and it was such a dirty, naughty turn on. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  As I was driving home, I was so overcome, I started whacking my bag and Florentine's  like, what are you doing, man?  You can't do that in a car.  I was not trying to be a faggot.  Oh, my God.  But it was all, was it out?  Oh, yeah.  They were in the front seat.  It was dark going home and I'm quietly in the back just trying to arc one on myself.  I didn't care.  Arc one on myself.  I really wanted 1965 Mississippi footage all over my stomach.  Instead, it looked like a stroke victim.  Yeah, exactly.  I stopped and it dribbled a little.  You ever do the work jerk? 
[00:52:00]  Anyone?  Anyone?  The work jerk?  Yes.  Slow day at work.  Yep.  Years ago.  It's the worst thing.  If you're an employer, I hate to blow up everyone's spot, but if you're an employer and you have  employees, guys in there, whether late teens or 20s or whatnot, you can't have penthouse  in your bathroom.  There was a stack of pornography in the bathroom because I guess the guy that ran this place  was just like a pervert, whatever.  I don't know.  Enjoyed looking at some penthouse. 
[00:52:30]  And you go in there and you're getting a, you're kind of growing at the drop of a hat.  Especially at that tender age.  You start thumbing through penthouse, you got it.  The what?  Jerk.  Sometimes you just got a jerk of work.  Have I done this here?  I don't think I've done it here.  Oh, don't say you have because I'm saying this has been many, many years.  You know, and I got to defend Anthony because there's a guy on the line, Mike.  If girls going at it, why is aunt watching Norton's crotch? 
[00:53:00]  Norton does this to the point you cannot ignore it.  Not only not ignore it, he'll go, aunt.  Check this out.  I love the point.  He goes, aunt.  And I turn my head and he points down and I look down.  I'm like, oh my God, he's sporting.  All right, look.  Rich Foster's on the line.  He's got some good stories about you, Jimmy.  Oh, great.  So we're going to take a break.  Also, I think we're going to continue our softball draft in the next break.  Oh, damn.  We forgot about that.  I'm ready to make Anthony a deal.  Is this one I might accept or is it a stupid deal? 
[00:53:30]  Yes, yes.  We've started putting the teams together for the softball game.  We do have a couple of people per team already.  We made some decisions yesterday.  Jim Norton's on my team.  My brother Elmo's on my team.  I got picked already?  Nice.  My brother Joe's on aunt's team.  And I gave him Fish, who was co-MVP of the last game.  He's a hitter and a drinker, which I like.  Oh, and you got Jay Moore and I got Jim Brewer.  Right.  That's where we're at.  And we're going to continue during the next break after we talk to Voss.  Also, Anthony, Steve the Whistler.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We're going to do that.  You didn't want me? 
[00:54:00]  What?  You didn't want me?  No.  You know what happened?  I took...  I'll explain it to you right now.  I had to take my brother because he's my brother.  He's so bad that I told Opie he had to pick somebody that was equally as bad on the list.  And Opie decided that you were probably at the same skill level.  You know what?  That really bothers me.  I don't like to be lumped in with...  Are you any good?  Actually, Joe's not a bad player.  He's probably very average for somebody that doesn't play, you know?  You weren't around two years.  Get used to it. 
[00:54:30]  I have a problem with every single person I pick.  You got my team.  Oh, yeah.  I pitched.  I used to play third base.  I played a lot of outfield.  That was good at one point.  Hey, uh...  I'm a little ball player.  You know, talking about the work jerk, Anthony?  Yeah.  We're going to play Hi, Mom.  I got fired from work for doing the work jerk.  Right.  One of our classics from the ONA Archives.  Or maybe not.  Hey, Chad!  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.  I got fired from...  Yes, I do. 
[00:55:00]  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Dude, I'll tell you right now.  If she buys this, we're going to give you a pair of tickets to the Halloween Cash Bash.  Yes.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Thanks.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  Um, can you pick me up from work?  How come I can't hear you?  Can you pick me up from work?  Yeah.  Um, I got fired.  What?  I got fired from work today.  Can you pick me up? 
[00:55:30]  No way.  Please, pick me up.  What the heck happened?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What are you going to tell me?  I was in the stock room, and someone walked in on me when I was at 8%.  What?  I got caught at 8% in the stock room.  They're going to have to pick me up.  They're going to give you a warning.  What are you, nuts?  Just come pick me up, will you, Mom? 
[00:56:00]  Chad, you're supposed to do stuff like that, the privacy of your own home.  I know.  It's embarrassing, Mom.  I don't...  So where are you?  With a pay phone or something?  No, I'm at work, and, you know, I'm here.  Everyone's been looking at me and laughing at me and stuff.  It's just...  Just come pick me up, will you, please?  All right, all right.  Want me to meet you out back?  Huh?  Want me to meet you out back?  Yeah, just pick me up where you dropped me off this morning.  All right.  You okay?  Well, besides my pride, I'm embarrassed.  Just pick me up as soon as you get a chance.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  Thanks.  All right, I'll be there.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God, dude.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Whip it up, Quincy.  Woo-hoo!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Great.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love the fact that you have no clue what I'm doing. 
[00:57:00]  I never hear what you're doing until I hear the spot.  So I'm just doing my read.  I didn't know you were doing Hot Wire.  That's my new read, man, for Hot Wire.  Oh, I like it.  Do you like it, Anthony?  Do you like it?  It's curiously erotic.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We love Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Thanks for the support out there. 
[00:57:30]  I think Flash and Friday is really good, too.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Fat Steven Pig-like us.  With a Down Syndrome haircut.  He is a fat body with sunglasses and drinks wine on the air and beats his wife.  So I respect that one thing.  It's just a matter of time before we get out on the L.A. airwaves.  Oh, yeah.  It'll happen.  There is nothing worse than some fat dude trashing chicks.  Well, you understand what I mean?  You know he's the type of fat guy that never got anything in high school  and he's just sitting there now with a microphone in front of him. 
[00:58:00]  Well, ladies, I don't want to get there.  He should be grateful at any woman that would want to do anything with him.  And he's such a nasty...  He really is.  Come on!  He's not funny.  He'll get his.  Oh, yeah, they all will.  They all get it in the end.  Right.  She's a suckin' thief.  So Voss is on the line.  Great.  By the way, someone wrote in on the instant feedback.  You know, it's looking like they found Sean or Levy's remains? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Josh from Long Island.  The skeleton they found in the D.C. area is really Voss' career.  Oh!  Come on.  The guy's got a great career.  He sure does.  And he's right here.  Hello.  Hey, Voss.  I got it.  My career stinks after today.  Anyhow.  Hi, Angel.  Hey, Cookie.  Hey, did you ever go with us?  It was in, like, Philly.  Right outside Philly, there was, like, this...  Those rooms where the girls and the peepoos,  and you go into the room with them, 
[00:59:00]  and you pay them, like...  You know, I talked them down to, like, ten bucks,  and they would watch you do things with yourself.  Did you ever go with, like, me and Levy and Florentine?  I went to a lot of them in South Jersey.  Uh-huh.  The one I actually went to in Philly,  my buddies took me off for my birthday.  My buddy Kenny and a few other guys,  and Lou, they chipped in and they bought me a hooker for my birthday.  What is this, though?  You go in a booth and the girls watch you...  No, well, yeah, or they...  I think they give you, like, lap dances with your clothes off or something.  Like, one night I got kicked out of the place. 
[00:59:30]  They just threw me out.  I was kicked out of a peep booth, but...  Wow, were your little midgety fingers freaking out the girls?  No, they...  Because they weren't going for, you know,  the money I was trying to get them to go for.  Ah.  And one night we were in there...  How many quarters can you hold in those little hands?  It wasn't quarters.  So, listen.  And one night...  Bing, bing.  They're falling between his fingers.  So, they would watch you, right?  And under, like, under the shade,  there was, like, maybe three inches where you could see. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And Levy was in there,  and you could see the shadow of his hand going back and forth real quick.  Like, me and Florentine were cracking up.  All you saw was his shadow going back and forth real quick.  Right?  And then he was finished,  and all of a sudden, they make a call,  and this guy comes running in there with a big mop.  A mop.  Yes, I was there for that.  That was on 1.30 in Jersey.  To mop it up.  You were there?  It was me, you, Florentine, and Levy.  It's a whole place smelled like ammonia.  Yes.  It's right past Cinnamincent. 
[01:00:30]  It's a phenomenal place.  It's all jail booths and traffic circles down in South Jersey.  Tourism there should be booming.  Dude, remember there's a place in the people in 4th and Broadway  where you brought the chick one time in the Central Park,  or that same place.  Yeah.  A chick actually let me,  I was doing a little mushroom balloon nut eating for five bucks.  Wow.  The window used to be up before Giuliani closed them all.  Now the window would come up and there's no glass?  No.  So she's right there.  They were standing at chest level so certain areas were at face level.  Like your face would go through the little glass and they'd have to squat down to talk 
[01:01:00]  to you.  Oh, I got you.  So they stood up.  Oh, balloon nut heaven.  Hello.  Five bucks.  Wait a minute.  And you're not worried?  You paid her five bucks and you put your face there.  Right in there.  Because I'm a good guy like that.  I'm not worried you're going to touch something?  Don't you know what you would catch up?  I'm a mute.  I'm a mute.  That's years ago.  I had one girl scold me.  She's like, woohoo, no tongue, sweetie.  That's true.  It was a different girl. 
[01:01:30]  Such an awful man.  I slipped her a fiver and she gave me a little scolding.  She did, didn't she?  I brought a couple of girls into those places, but the Indian guys always throw you out.  They're always blocking.  Yeah.  And there was one place where the windows come up in South Philly or South Jersey where it's  like a circle, though, like of windows.  And then the windows came up and the girl's in the middle.  And all of a sudden I look across and I see like Florentine's head out of another window.  And it kind of like put a damper on things.  It's not like, you know, laying in bed with you, who I'm used to. 
[01:02:00]  It's in the round, you're saying.  I've heard of these places where the windows will open up and not only that you see the girl,  but you see all the other guys that are cranking.  All the other perverts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's the same way the 54th Umbrella one was.  That was the same setup.  There was one booth I was in over, I think it was by like 56 or something.  And I don't go to them a lot.  And all of a sudden I'm in there and all of a sudden I see a tongue between like the wall come through. 
[01:02:30]  Right?  Did the wall come through or did you hit the little glass and the thing went,  and it's a little buddy booth opener.  And it was horrible.  The tongue came through into your booth?  Yeah, because there's like a crack between a plexiglass.  So what did you do?  Huh?  What did you do?  Ask Norton.  What did I do?  I ran out of the booth.  It was scary.  That's funny.  It was, yeah, a lot of times you got to watch it because the guys will hit on you.  And usually I don't, I'm not a phobic about that. 
[01:03:00]  I could care less.  I just mind my business.  And they don't touch you.  They look at you and you will keep walking.  But before I knew, I didn't know this would happen.  I was in another one in South Jersey.  It's just a wonderful part of New Jersey.  And there was a little hole in the side.  And I didn't know there was a hole in the side.  And I'm whacking my bag and I hear,  It's absolutely true.  I looked down.  You actually, someone went,  Yeah, what are they going to do?  Excuse me, sir.  I mean, they have to go,  Because it's illegal, I imagine. 
[01:03:30]  And there's a little hole.  And I looked down and I see a big black finger  crooking at me in the come hither motion.  Like, come hither.  Yeah, it was awful.  Like an Addams Family episode.  The fat guy over on room one and nine throws notes.  That's different.  Voss, which place do you mean?  Well, everyone.  The fat guy on one and nine throws notes over the wall.  I've had them lobbed over at me, too,  But they're in full door.  What does it say?  They throw notes?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, look at me.  If I'm in a booth, believe me.  I'm Jennifer Lopez when I'm in a booth.  I know. 
[01:04:00]  I'm nothing on the streets,  But I'm a catch in a peep show.  One guy threw a note and I opened it up  And I said, write a new joke.  I like the ones in Edison, New Jersey,  Because of the stupid zoning laws  And a bunch of religious...  That's the one.  No, no, that's not the one.  The one I'm talking about is  It was way farther up by Rowley Prison.  The toilet felt like it's Carvel Ice Cream stores.  Oh, it is actually on the floor.  You know what's the worst?  Hold on.  They have the one.  They have the booths cut chest level. 
[01:04:30]  So you can't whack your bag or anything.  Well, no.  I'll tell you what's the worst.  Now, you go in Pennsylvania out by Lancaster,  There's no doors.  I've been there, too.  No doors at all.  Did you just sell them?  All of a sudden, guys come strolling by and stuff.  It's horrible.  Yeah, I've had them.  You want to buy a peep show door?  Hey, Velcro feet, you mind continually walking?  It's the absolute worst.  And you ever drop your last piece of chewing gum on that floor?  Boy, isn't that a pest? 
[01:05:00]  How about the guy that didn't get hired to mop up those floors?  Oh, my God.  You guys are a pisser, man.  There are so many booths.  I love them.  When I'm on the road, dude, is there anything greater than when you're on the road,  you see a booth, you're just like, ah, it's so cool.  You run in there.  A jack shack.  And I don't like to ever arc before a show.  I never dump before a show.  Oh, because you need the energy.  And you need your legs about you.  Well, that's the worst.  On the way to a gig, you don't want to do it before,  because then the whole night you just feel like a total zero.  Yeah.  But on the way back from me, like if you're leaving Saturday night, 
[01:05:30]  and, you know, if you got rejected by the whole audience.  You treat yourself.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You know, 50, 75 cents.  You can't do it beforehand, and then you get all ready,  and then in the middle of your act,  you feel that pulling sensation because you're stuck to your jockeys.  Oh.  You never have that?  And you turn the wrong way and you go, ow!  It's like the crazy glue tip when the little glue on the hole.  You know what's the worst?  I'll tell you what's the worst.  When you're doing the bathtub, 
[01:06:00]  and it looks like little jellyfish comes floating towards you.  Dude, it sticks to you like rubber cement,  and you've got to pick that and hairs off.  It's awful.  You never, never arc in the tub.  I know.  It's the worst.  Something happens, and it mixes with the water and turns into sacrete.  Little rubber cement balls all over your leg hairs and your stomach.  Yeah, pull the hair and everything out.  It was like a monkey did it in his hand and threw it on you.  And you weren't smart enough to get your face in there,  so now it's all over the place. 
[01:06:30]  I can't imagine why my show wasn't picked up after this.  Oh, my God.  They didn't pick up your show?  Yeah, I found out today.  Oh, dearly.  Oh, those bastards.  You know what?  You know what?  Here's the deal.  They had a whole big turnover at the company,  and they hired a new man Monday, a new president.  Yes.  But the thing is, they didn't pick it up,  but the head, the main guy, the president,  said he likes me a lot and they want to do something.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Hey, look, that's a better response than I got on the stairs in Washington. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, dude, I got some ideas for you, by the way.  All right.  Are we going to do it or what?  Yeah, yeah, we'll talk about it.  Hold on.  We got a great new bit for Voss.  But let's not talk about it on the air now until we figure it out,  because I got some ideas for it, too.  Oh, and you don't want to give it away?  Well, not until we have it locked down,  where we're going to do it and stuff and how.  Yeah, okay.  How about Brian Park?  Huh?  That's one of my ideas.  Yeah.  I would make a phone at Brian Park  and start telling some of those awful jokes to David Blaine  while he's standing there. 
[01:07:30]  I hear Voss got a little worked up when they didn't pick the show off  and he went to a relative and explained it,  and the relative a little pissed at your attitude, Voss.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I need that part.  It's going to make me a star.  But Voss never gets that part.  It's perfect for him.  It'll make his ear not smell and make him a big star.  And he came in with his little midgety fingers and Jewish lack of charm.  And you know what?  And she left just to make me look tall.  And here's the thing. 
[01:08:00]  You know, oh, God.  Here's the thing.  It tested really well, too.  Yeah, well, so did your blood, but that didn't mean anything.  Oh, shut up, stupid.  Dude, you'll get in the...  The H1's comedy department sucks.  No, it's...  Whatever it is, I'm sure the show is funny,  and of course they're not going to pick it up because it was funny.  And he stole her away.  He was jacking it with Norton.  In the bed.  He flipped a coin and lost and had to F her. 
[01:08:30]  Here's the deal.  O.B., and this is seriously...  All the crap we do, I know how to play baseball, softball.  Really?  I'm not fooling around.  That's because you're too small to have a good strike zone.  Listen...  Well, we're going to have the...  We're going to pick some more players after the break, Voss.  Second base.  So you listen and see if you get picked up by either Anthony or I, okay?  Second base.  But we have a great radio bit for Voss.  Yes.  Yeah.  I guess we don't want to give it away yet until we...  I think we're going to tape this one.  Yeah.  No, it'll work. 
[01:09:00]  I got some ideas, too.  You want to try to do it next week?  Yeah.  Why not?  All right.  Cool.  Well, you know what?  I might come into New York tomorrow and we'll talk about it.  All right.  We're going to go hit golf balls, too.  All right, Voss.  All right.  I'll see you girls later.  See you, buddy.  There he goes.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss never gets that part.  Those goddamn stories you two have are just amazing.  They're all true.  You are degenerates.  And I can't believe you know so many jack shacks all over the country like that.  Oh, please.  I love them.  You've left batches everywhere. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, awful.  More than Johnny Appleseed.  I'm horrible.  There should be little Norton springing up all over upstate New York and South Jersey.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I feel like an absolute winner after listening to Voss and Norton.  I used to think I was a pervert and stuff looking at porn, but, man, now I feel like  an absolute angel.  Yeah.  Dude, nothing wrong with it, though, man.  It's, you know, whatever.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  And Mona wants in real fast.  Mona. 
[01:10:00]  I'm normally a little goody-two-shoes, but for some reason, after listening to more Norton  than the midget, I got really turned on, and now I'm getting really scared.  Thank you.  I'm going to turn into some pervert like Norton now.  No, no, no.  It's not a matter of being a pervert.  Everybody's got a little pervert vibe to them, man.  Women have it.  It's just that women, here's the thing you got about women.  It's not guys like me, because, I mean, as awful as I am, if you say no, I'm like,  ugh, all right, I accept it.  It's the guy with the little pocket protector and the glasses.  That's the guy that's going to pipe you over the head with a shovel.  Me, I'll just think about it, Lance. 
[01:10:30]  No, but unfortunately, I find you attractive.  That's the problem.  Quiet.  Mona's talking.  Where are you from, Mona?  Hey, Norton, you're single.  I actually am single.  It sucks.  I'm lonely.  Yeah.  You were getting a little turned on by that, though?  Unfortunately, yeah.  Really?  What parts?  I could cut glass right about now.  Wow.  What, did you like just guys talking about jacking?  I don't know what it was, but for some reason, when Norton was talking about what turns them  on, because some of that I do, and it gets me going. 
[01:11:00]  Well, of course, it's different when a girl does it, though.  No, I do it to the guys, and I love giving hummers.  That is like my absolute turn.  Hey, wow.  What a trooper.  All right, Mona, you're past Jim's audition.  Hold on.  He'll talk to you.  Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Mona's not hitting on me.  She's just saying that she was turned on by something.  Oh, of course not.  George did not.  Look at me, Jim.  I'll make believe I'm hanging up on her.  Bye, Mona.  Oh, there she goes.  Oh, how come she's still there?  It's a radio oblivion.  No, she's not there, Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  See, she's gone.  All right, man, I've got to go to the bathroom.  We're going to break.  We're going to pick some players for the softball game.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  And we'll do that next.  We're going to pick some players. 
[01:12:00]  Show your balance to guys.  Show your balance to guys.  If you're my tank below the dashboard.  Below the dashboard.  We'll lift those babies up high.  Lift those babies up high.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  Take them out, baby, now.  Take them out, baby.  And flap them around.  Flap them around.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, lady, now.  Come on, come on, lady.  Come on, that's what wow is about.  What wow is about.  You've got to lose that shirt.  Lose that shirt.  And let the fun bags bounce.  Fun bags bounce.  See those more.  For more sake.  For more sake.  Just let those jugs come out. 
[01:13:00]  Let those jugs come out.  Woo.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  How old are you?  18.  All right.  Pour your shirt on.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Hopi ravioli.  Hopi and Anthony.  Seven dust.  Live again. 
[01:13:30]  We're back with the Hopi and Anthony show.  A couple things real fast.  Your pals made the New York Post today.  You can read it online.  Page6.com.  About the M&M thing.  Yeah.  I heard a DJ on KTU.  Yeah.  Flip around the dial, you know, here in New York.  He was playing a track from the M&M album that no one else was playing.  Right.  And he was all panicky going, oh, I hope I don't get in trouble for this. 
[01:14:00]  I hope it'll get fired.  It was so hokey and so stupid.  We had to show him and everyone else the way.  That's why he was playing it.  I'm just trying to pop up something on MTV News 2.  Because apparently he's very angry now, Marshall.  And he's making threats.  Why?  He's all about bucking the system.  Hopi?  Apparently not.  Apparently not. 
[01:14:30]  I thought so, too.  Well, I'll read the post and then you can read the MTV.com thing, okay?  Right.  And then maybe it'll all make sense here.  In the New York Post today, page6.com.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony are proud to have helped get M&M's new album released a week early.  Fans have been downloading the M&M show free from the internet for months when O&A brought  national attention to them by playing five tracks on their syndicated show last week.  Days later, Interscope sped the release.  And then there's a quote from me saying, you can't put two lines in a room with a dead 
[01:15:00]  gazelle and say, don't eat it until we say so.  I'm proud of my quote this time around.  My quote?  More gooder than Anthony's this time around.  Well, he went with your quote and says, Greg Opie Hughes.  And then Anthony says, just me, Anthony.  I don't have a middle quoted thing.  Anthony says, we were going to play another one, but we were rudely interrupted by an Interscope  cease and desist order, says co-host Anthony Coombe. 
[01:15:30]  There you go.  Not giving your line as much enthusiasm as me.  No, I noticed.  That's the way it works.  You know, one interview, you get a good one.  Well, you know, when we had that murder guy on last week, you had all the quotes.  All right.  All right.  And you know something, though?  Sometimes the bad quotes are the good quotes, the memorable quotes.  Maybe the quote that you read one day, a year, two years later, you don't remember that  quote, but you remember. 
[01:16:00]  What quote do people remember from Time Magazine?  I will confess, Anthony, you had the best quote ever.  But at the time, it wasn't.  But now I cannot remember any other quote from our Time Magazine article aside from my  quote of Mary Kate's the prude, Ashley's the goer.  That's a brilliant quote.  Thank you.  I'll beat it someday.  Anyway, I'm up for the challenge.  Up for that challenge.  I thought my two-lying gazelle thing was kind of okay.  It puts it in perspective.  People can then look at that, picture it, and understand the situation. 
[01:16:30]  So what's the latest on this damn thing?  Well, Eminem is a little mad.  Marshall Mathers is a little upset at his CD being released on the Internet and being played  on this very program, he's very pissed off, and he said, because it had to be, the date  had to be pushed back.  The rapper said bluntly, I think that S is effing bull S.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  Whoever put my S on the Internet, I want to meet that M-effer and beat the S out of him  because I picture this scrawny little D-head going, I got Eminem's new CD.  I got Eminem's new CD.  I'm going to put it on the Internet.  I think that anybody who tries to make excuses for that S is an effing bitch.  End of quote.  He's right.  Slow down.  But he's not attacking you guys, man.  He's saying whoever put it on the net, you guys didn't put it on the net.  Don't matter. 
[01:17:30]  I think, yeah, I still don't, I don't know.  You know, Jason Newstead came in and talked about the Internet and how the music's out there  and stuff.  You can't stop it.  There's nothing you can do about it.  You've got to come up with better ideas.  The goddamn thing's getting out there.  Check your own people.  Check your own record company people.  That's your first line of defense of the scumbags you're working with.  It's not even the scumbags you're working with.  I think they do this thing on purpose. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  That's another theory.  And the media's in an uproar.  You say you're pissed off.  And then you've got, you know, DJs talking about this on the air.  You can't have two.  Promoting the fact that Eminem has a new CD out.  You can't have two killer whales in a room and have a seal on a table and expect us not  to eat it.  Why?  Was that good?  That was good.  That's very close.  I mean, you can't have me and Voss in a room and have a chick in the middle of  it'll not expect us to whack our bags on her. 
[01:18:30]  But yeah, he seems like he's pissed off about somebody uploading his stuff.  Because even playing it on the air is not giving it away.  When you're stealing it off the net, that's how they're losing the problem.  Hey, man, simple as this.  If it's on the internet, you know, we're going to grab it and we're going to play it.  Absolutely.  There are ways to put the checks in place and you've got to start with your own peeps,  as they call them, Marshall.  Your peeps.  And Anthony and I are working on something huge.  It is a daily effort of looking, searching, and scraping, trying to find something. 
[01:19:00]  And when we find it, it will be giant.  It will be more giant than this Eminem crap.  Oh, it makes this seem like nothing.  And we're making some leeway.  The ultimate, and I think it will be the ultimate sacrifice for us,  because we will get completely effed for this.  You think?  I am absolutely positive.  We're working hard, though.  And we're getting closer.  We're looking.  It's like the Holy Grail, this one.  Three minutes, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Searching for the holy effing grail.  Leah.  Listen to the grail.  Leah, you've got to make it fast.  Oh, God.  She's listening to the radio.  She's listening to the radio.  Oh, boy.  Hello?  Leah.  Turn that...  Leah.  Leah.  Hello?  Turn that goddamn radio down.  No, you're saying, Leah, my name is Tia.  Whatever!  Stupid twat!  How about twat?  No, I'm not.  Listen, guys.  What do you mean?  I need to get this out there.  Okay.  I've been driving up and down for a month on the parkway. 
[01:20:00]  My boyfriend's...  Oh, my God.  And she's potty-mouthing?  You're a potty-mouth?  All right.  She's very pissed off because she's driving up and down and she hasn't seen an effing  wow sticker, right?  Yeah!  And you're ready to wow, right?  Yeah!  See, guys?  See?  And I'm not that bad looking either.  I don't get it, man.  If I was a fan of this show, I would just put the wow sticker on and go, what the hell?  Where are you?  You know, it just might happen to me.  Yeah.  What do you got to lose?  We take calls from these girls every week that want to wow, but they don't see the stickers. 
[01:20:30]  And we tell them, only wow the guys that have wow in their car.  Don't give it away for free.  No, I'm not.  Where are you?  I see like one or two of them.  It's Southern New Jersey on the parkway between Exit 67 and 89.  All right.  And you're just cruising that area right now?  Yeah.  I'm in a gold Acura Integra.  I got two guys in the front seat, my boyfriend and his friend.  We all work in the same place.  All right.  Cool.  Well, if it happens, let us know, okay?  Yeah.  All right, Tia.  Thanks.  What kind of car do you have? 
[01:21:00]  An Acura Integra, a little gold two-door.  There you go.  And I'm in the back, waiting.  Oh, Tia, one other thing?  Yeah.  I felt that I asked the important questions there.  Of course you did.  One that was just answered a second before you asked.  All right.  You did great, Norm.  Maybe I can pay attention.  Hey, that is the worst on this show.  Because as people are talking sometimes, as long as either Opie or I or even Jimmy is 
[01:21:30]  paying attention, depending on who is more suited to answer the question, a couple of  us might then go and read some instant feedback during the person's conversation.  And you get in at the end of the conversation again and ask something really stupid.  You ask something that the person had just said.  We all do that, too.  And you come off looking like the dick.  I pick up on that all the time.  Yeah.  I'm just like, oh, boy.  Hopefully the listeners in here, the listeners in here, the...  Well, that's why.  Sometimes, Anthony, when we talk and I'll be in another place, man. 
[01:22:00]  And I'm looking at instant feedback, looking at the phone, seeing if there's anything we  should pick up on the phone line.  I have no clue what he's saying.  And then I'll just jump in.  Yeah, you're right, Anthony.  Okay, let's go over here.  I'm just hoping that you weren't saying something really stupid.  We should try to catch the other guys not listening and just sell them down the river.  Guy gives out an address, you know.  Well, it's 57th and 7th.  That's located out.  All right.  Hey, by the way, where is that located?  Why don't you give the address out?  But I was reading instant feedback. 
[01:22:30]  I'm sorry.  Jason, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  How are you, Jason?  Yeah, listen, I don't know what he, Eminem, is bitching about, but there's a radio station  in Boston last night that played the entire album start to finish with the skits and everything  last night with one commercial break.  Yeah, you know what?  They were calling it the big debut, yadda, yadda, yadda.  And, Jason, you know what?  They were hoping they were going to get some attention and maybe the press or MTV to report  on it.  But they're not.  But, of course, they did it at midnight.  So, who the hell was listening? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, we paved the way.  So, now it's too late.  Now, pretty much any radio station in America can play the damn thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know, oh, wow, look at that being outrageous.  Oh, ho, ho.  Hey, dude, what time did they do it?  It was like midnight to one.  Dick.  Yeah, he is a dick, Jason.  You're right.  I've got to love that yam bag.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye, Angel. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, pretend you're outrageous.  We showed you the way once again.  And real fast, Anthony, Photoshopcontest.com.  Yeah.  It's getting ridiculous and hilarious.  It's very funny.  They took a photo.  What they do is they have, I guess, a photo of the day.  And they want people to go to their site, take that photo that they post, and then add  to it using Photoshop and make it funny by adding, you know, putting the people in the  original photograph in a wacky scene or incorporating some wacky element into the original picture. 
[01:24:00]  So they took our picture.  It's from FHM magazine.  The picture of us with the megaphone in front of the microphone and gave that to the people  to F with with Photoshop.  And they came up with some really funny stuff.  And every day there's like ten new ones.  Us as the Taurus is one of my favorites with really bad shirts on, collared shirts and the  lay and then drinks in front of us. 
[01:24:30]  One of my new favorites.  We're pickled punks in this one.  Yeah, I know which one's your new favorite.  And it's mine, too.  Let me see that, Ben.  Look at us as pickled punks.  And they put Jimmy's head in there, too, in between us.  Jimmy's head actually looks like it belongs on that pickled punk, doesn't it?  It really does.  Like, all right, it's wacky.  Look at Opie and Anthony's head on the pickled punk.  But who's the punk in the middle?  Oh, there's Jimmy.  Why didn't they alter the punk in the middle?  I really do look like a pickled punk.  Look at us as Starsky and Hodge. 
[01:25:00]  That's good.  I know this is radio, but you go to PhotoshopContest.com.  You can check these photos out for yourself later.  Where's the one where they morphed my head and Anthony's head?  It's scary.  They took, like, the top of Opie's head and the bottom of my head.  And then they did the same thing with my picture.  That's great.  We're chicks.  You've got to find that one.  It's up a little further.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Right there.  Right there.  Look how, look at that.  Look how effed up that is.  Doesn't the guy on the left look like, it looks like man cow morphed with Scott Shannon. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  It's freaky.  They took Anthony's goatee and put it on my face.  On the top of your head.  Yeah, it's really good.  Very strange.  Check it out for yourself.  PhotoshopContest.com.  We've got the link on FoundryMusic.com as well.  All right.  Yes, Jim?  I was just wondering when we were going to start guessing what everybody's favorite ice cream flavor is.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:26:00]  Hey, I want to make Anthony a deal.  We're picking teams for the Celebrity Softball Game.  It goes down Saturday, June 1st at Riverfront Stadium.  A beautiful, beautiful ballpark.  It's the home of the Newark Bears, Anthony.  And it's sponsored by Coors Light, our game.  And this game is going to be so much better than the one two years ago.  And that one was a huge success.  But this year we've got like the Titanic slide.  We've got a chance for our listeners to win $25,000.  Yeah.  We're going to do a halftime type of thing where we shave like Stark or Patty's hair in front of 8,000 people. 
[01:26:30]  It's going to be a lot of things going on.  And we're going to invite like 10 of our listeners down to try to win $25,000 by pitching a softball.  You know, you've seen these at sporting events and stuff.  Yeah, it's like the big pitch.  You know, they do it at football games.  You've got to make that field goal.  Right.  And it's very difficult for just an average Joe to come out there and do that.  But if you do it and you're lucky, you can win some big bucks.  And it's not with a regular softball, the pitch, though, right?  Isn't it like where you take a Molotov cocktail and you have to lob it into Lady Di's bologna? 
[01:27:00]  Well, that's later on in the game.  It's a different contest.  We're still trying to figure out what they're going to do for the game, by the way.  Some other prizes provided by Sonic Blue.  Sonic Blue's new Rio Riot MP3 player.  But 5,000 songs in the palm of your hand.  Check it out at your local electronics retailer or sonicblue.com.  We've got the Frenchie dunking booth, Anthony.  Live music is official from Octane.  There you go.  As people filter into the stadium.  These guys, we met them down in Philly at the road show we did about, I don't know, eight or nine months ago. 
[01:27:30]  We couldn't get filter while people Octane into the stadium?  That would have been cool, too.  Octane rocks.  Yes.  And they're a bunch of great guys that are going to help us out with the game as people are getting to their seats.  We've got interactive games, vendors, and prizes.  And it's going to be a great time.  I think there are tickets available, standing room tickets, through Ticketmaster if you still want to get a ticket.  But we've been picking the team slowly but surely.  Are tickets still available?  Yeah, I think so.  Look at Ben. 
[01:28:00]  I have to address Eric from Queens.  This may help in our quest for what we are calling the Holy Grail.  Eric from Queens?  What if it's somebody like...  Oh, it isn't.  It's Eric from Queens.  Okay.  I think a lot of people could figure it out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We're working hard on this one.  You know what, though?  It might help us out.  Never know.  I doubt it.  Yeah, so do I.  We'll see, though.  All right.  I have the ONA softball player list here in my hand. 
[01:28:30]  A couple of the guys already been picked.  Actually, given.  No, Rick's got the guys that have been picked.  Okay.  Right.  My team so far, I've got Brewer, Jim Norton, and my brother Elmo.  My brother Elmo's the guy that designed the WOW sticker, by the way.  Anthony has Jay Moore.  Jay Moore!  Fish, who was co-MVP of the last game with my brother Elmo.  And your brother Joe.  And my brother Joe.  Right now, I'd have to say it's even teams. 
[01:29:00]  I was picked first.  No, you weren't.  Yes, I was.  No, you weren't.  Fish cancels out Elmo, I believe.  Yep.  As far as softball talent, they're both very talented.  Norton and my brother, pretty much even right there.  And Brewer and Jay Moore, who's to say?  Jay Moore has a lot to answer for from last game.  He struck out.  He was first at bat.  First inning.  He gets up.  Slow pitch softball.  Opie pitching.  Jay Moore struck out.  He has to make up for that.  He knows it.  The pressure's on. 
[01:29:30]  Brewer?  I don't know.  Never saw him play.  He has great stories about growing up on Long Island.  And it seems like all he did was play wiffle ball and softball.  And he's been hitting the batting cage.  He has been.  Yeah, big time.  You know what, though?  You know, Brewer, maybe years ago, the guy ain't a kid anymore.  And he's kind of, he's got a little bit of a gut.  And don't forget, he enjoys the pot.  And he does more drugs than Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now.  How effective is he going to be on a softball field? 
[01:30:00]  Exactly.  See, Opie, those are some things you've got to consider.  Jay Moore, regardless, is somewhat of an athlete.  You know, he tries to keep himself in shape.  I'll tell you what.  God only knows.  Yeah, everyone should know.  You see him naked pretty much on every episode of his goddamn TV show.  I saw that.  I'll tell you right now, I gave you Jay Moore?  Yeah.  Because I think he's going to blow us off.  And you're going to be short a good player.  No, you know something?  I am using my head.  I know Jay enough to know that if he did say he was going to be there,  and finally did say it, he will be there. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  I do believe it.  All right, and I'm prepared to make a deal with you.  A deal.  Here we go.  The first big deal.  These guys that we already have chosen were pretty much assigned.  A lot more people are listening to us than the last time we did this.  Oh, yeah.  I effed you over so bad with deals last time around.  No way.  Oh, I did?  You know why?  You started making crazy trades.  You started panicking.  Hindsight, my friend.  We had nothing to base the decisions on last year because we hadn't seen people play. 
[01:31:00]  I didn't think Earl would have been a good choice.  Who knew?  Who knew?  Who knew the black guy could play ball?  I'm so stupid.  That's what I'm saying.  I know, but we didn't, you know, I thought it was going to be like, you know,  how he is kind of around here sometimes.  A little slow and a little unfocused.  Well, you know.  Yeah, okay.  A little unfocused.  Very good.  All right, and I'm prepared to make a deal with you.  And he turns out to be a great player. 
[01:31:30]  I will give you Pete Radovich.  Whoa, wait a minute.  Pete Radovich.  Pete Radovich now, if you give me two picks.  You know, I don't even really have to look over this list because I cannot find two people  that you could take that would equal Pete Radovich.  Although, let me tell you.  Explain who Pete Radovich is.  Pete Radovich.  I don't even know why we want him around. 
[01:32:00]  To remind us of the dark days of the O&A show.  But he, what the hell?  He worked with us putting together the XFL Game Day pregame show that we hosted for an  hour or two back when that sport was on television.  Yeah, thanks, Pete.  Pete used to call us from L.A. because he was doing the NBA games as well.  Guys, you got anything for the show this week?  No.  All I got to say is thank God Pete was there.  And then Pete goes, well, I don't have anything either.  I'll see you at the taping.  He'd just roll a camera, tape some, like, players and cheerleaders and see what we can 
[01:32:30]  make of it.  But Pete, good guy.  Great guy.  Big guy.  Very talented guy.  And he's an athlete.  He plays a lot of basketball.  And this little tidbit of info came out.  The guy played college ball.  He played college baseball.  So I'm thinking it's a good choice.  And we were talking about the Pete Radovich wild card and how that would play and how we  would be able to trade.  You're now offering me Pete Radovich. 
[01:33:00]  Pete Radovich.  For two players.  Yes.  And then we'll go from there.  Then you'll, you know, you'll get the next pick after that.  Let me see if I can guess who this is.  Can I just read down the list for the listeners at home?  Yeah.  Let's get all the players out there.  Of course, there's Opie and Anthony.  That would be you.  Yes.  Yeah.  Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Anthony Cumia.  Anthony Anthony Cumia.  Then there's Rick.  Ben.  Mm-hmm.  Awesome Garrett. 
[01:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  Norton.  Mm-hmm.  Steve C.  Mm-hmm.  Jay Moore.  Mm-hmm.  Pete Radovich.  Yep.  Jim Brewer.  Mm-hmm.  Barry Williams.  The real Greg Brady.  Right.  Rick Cerrone.  Wow.  Limo Ant.  He-he-he-he-he.  Rich Voss.  Paul, Kathleen, take your clothes off, Mercurio.  Black Earl.  There's no Colin Quinn.  Is that?  We'll find out Monday.  We'll find out Monday.  Oh, come on, Colin.  Don't let us down.  Help us out.  My brother, Joe.  Opie's brother, Elmo. 
[01:34:00]  Fish.  Keith.  Keith, the cop, is playing.  Mm-hmm.  Joey Paisano.  Mm-hmm.  Steven Lynch.  Mm-hmm.  Frenchy.  Yes.  Oh, God.  What a waste.  The bullet's coming out to me.  I still end there.  Old Dirty.  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  That just rang a bell with me, Old Dirty.  Might be one of Opie's picks.  He's Dominican.  That's a ringer right there.  A good thing, if you pick Frenchy on your team, the other team's not allowed to hit the 
[01:34:30]  ball directly over his head.  And by the way, you know Old Dirty will be.  Thank you.  Sorry.  That's a good joke.  Trust me.  Someone will get it.  Okay.  They do.  I was just thinking about Old Dirty and how effective he'll be in stealing bases.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Devin.  Get it?  You know, Buzz from Home Alone.  Yeah, no, because he'll stale it and put it back.  Look at us explaining our jokes today.  Breaking comedy rule number one.  I know.  No, no, just because the whole thing is a thief and stuff and, you know. 
[01:35:00]  I was talking about, you know, plane flyovers.  Yeah.  We had to go around France and, you know.  Some get it, some don't.  Hey, keep up, folks.  Pew, pew.  Let's see.  Devin.  Let's try not to get silly today, guys.  Adam Ferrara, my pal.  Paul the pilot.  He's the guy that flies his plane around and writes wow in the sky.  Right.  Although this season, a little hard to fly your plane erratically above midterm in Manhattan. 
[01:35:30]  I got to tell you, we went all out for the celebrities this time around.  Well, all right.  You see, now you spoke right before the next guy that I'm saying.  And now you put your foot in your mouth.  All right.  It's none other than frosted side of the mini-wheat Jeff Norris.  So, nah.  Pseudo-celebrity softball game.  This is an awful lineup.  See, that's the joke.  See, there's really no celebrities.  Shut up.  It's the who the F is that celebrity softball game. 
[01:36:00]  Notice we announced the celebrities after the game is pretty much sold out.  We got Greg Brady.  We got Jim Brewer.  We got Rick.  These are awful.  Breast cancer doctor.  Are you kidding?  Wow.  We're not kidding.  The guy that brought the cancerous breast and esophagus.  Right.  All right.  Our own Saturday, Friday, and Saturday Night Rocks DJ, Eddie Trunk. 
[01:36:30]  Correct.  Eddie, I wonder how Eddie is.  I wonder if he'll bring, well, he's friends with Piazza.  Maybe he'll bring more.  Oh, oh.  Eddie is friends with Piazza.  Doesn't matter.  With Mike, I'm not gay, Piazza.  And Big Kev.  That's the lineup.  All right.  That is our choice of players.  Decision time, Anthony.  Bring your cameras, folks.  It's going to be a good show.  Hang out in front.  Meet a celebrity.  You know.  Maybe we could have some cutouts of real celebrities.  Yeah.  That they could get their picture taken with. 
[01:37:00]  We can run them around the place.  Who do you want your photo with first, folks?  You know, I do kind of want Cal Bell Bill in here, though.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah, Cal Bell Bill plays.  You know, Cal Bell Bill played last year, and he's a very good friend of mine.  And he's, well, he's a lousy player, but he's great for morale in the dugout.  You don't have to sell it.  He should be on the list.  Okay.  Anthony, it's decision time.  Right.  I will give you Pete Radovich if you give me the next two picks.  The next two picks.  But you will not tell me what your picks are until I accept the deal? 
[01:37:30]  Correct.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Okay.  Well, let me tell you something.  And I will not pick Rick Cerrone.  Ex-Yankee great.  That doesn't even sound good, because let me tell you something.  Goddamn Rick Cerrone.  He's a great guy and all.  Runs a great park out there in Newark.  But I'm hoping you get Rick Cerrone.  He stunk last time we played.  I'll tell you my philosophy on Rick Cerrone.  Yeah.  I want him on your team, because when, like, all hell breaks loose and there's debauchery all 
[01:38:00]  over Riverfront Stadium, he'll be yelling at you in the dugout and not me, because I'll  be in the other dugout pitch.  I thought, I have figured out all the angles here, my friend.  I plan on being...  Not only am I going to kick your team's ass, I'm also going to have a really good time.  I plan on being so intoxicated that Rick wouldn't dare even speak to me.  He'll look at me in my eyes and just go, I better talk to Opie.  No, that ain't happening.  You'll be too starstruck with all the celebrities around.  Maybe talking to the NBC cameras.  All right, let me ask you a question before I accept this deal. 
[01:38:30]  I gave you too much already.  No, you didn't.  I will not be picking Rick Cerrone with one of my two picks if you pick Pete Radovich.  This is an easy question.  All right, go ahead.  Is your decision that you're going to make, if I take Pete Radovich, the next two picks  that you take, are they based on information that you have that I do not have?  No.  No.  No.  You didn't get any secret scouting reports from anybody?  Oh, no.  No.  Okay.  No, everyone on this list stinks.  We know that. 
[01:39:00]  Opie, I will absolutely take this deal.  I am taking Pete Radovich.  Why, did you find out Pete broke his leg or something?  No.  All right, take Pete Radovich.  I am taking Pete Radovich.  You now, Opie, have the next two picks, which cannot be Rick Cerrone.  I will be taking Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch.  Hoping to get a good game out of him in the early innings. 
[01:39:30]  Well, you got him.  You got to put him in early.  I need a shortstop, and Lynch is my man.  All right.  And once again, Black Earl.  Black Earl's a ringer.  No, Earl, I know.  Earl had a great game two years ago.  I am going with the Pete Radovich wild card here.  And there's another reason I'm picking Black Earl.  He can help me with the rest of the draft, because we worked good together two years ago.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  I believe that's fair.  I don't think I'm being screwed here.  Now, why don't you take the next pick, Anthony, to even out the teams.  Ooh.  All right.  And then we'll move on.  Which celebrity will it be?  Which star from the Walk of Fame is going to be on your team?  You already got Radovich.  Don't shoot too high.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let me look down the list here.  Oh, my God.  What a mess.  You know what? 
[01:40:30]  Looking at the list, I think I could go for that guy.  Oh, Braun, not a brain in his head.  Or I could go for him here.  But this guy, that guy, ethnically, it seems to be a good deal.  Remember the fun factor. 
[01:41:00]  He could be in jail the day of the game.  I know who you're talking about.  I know.  Well, we all do.  I'm pondering the old dirty choice.  I know I need to up the fun factor with my next pick.  Up the fun factor?  Ooh.  Yeah.  It's not all about skill.  You've got to have a little fun in the dugout.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mm.  Mm.  The fun factor.  That's why I'm thinking about picking the breast cancer doctor.  Wow.  Maybe he'll bring one in.  We could toss it around and splash it with a bat.  A little pepper with it.  Wuck, wuck, wuck, wuck, wuck. 
[01:41:30]  There we go.  Hey, Stinky, how do you play?  How's your game?  Oh, boy.  How's your game?  I'm good.  Are you good?  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  I think I'm better than most of the people on the list.  Oh, really?  Really?  I'm serious.  This game's going to be another disaster.  I'm asking awesome Gareth.  I am asking him.  He is quite awesome.  I played a lot of sports, you know, in high school and stuff.  Not recently.  That would explain your abs.  Perhaps he could pitch.  He's got a physique like the big unit. 
[01:42:00]  Let's hope.  Well, I think with this choice, I'm going to have to...  And part of this is taking somebody that I don't really want you to have as the next pick.  You know, I might want all dirty on the team, but I might not want you to have the likes of a Barry Williams for the celebrity factor on your team.  I don't want all the celebrities to be on your team.  Barry had nothing two years ago.  No.  He played well? 
[01:42:30]  He actually has a couple of good plays, too.  And he played very well at second base.  You know something?  A lot of people are asking, where's Dice?  It's an event that's not about him.  Look how he fields the ball.  Look how handsome he is.  He would make any highlight reel look like nothing compared to his genius and skills.  His smile is like the sunrise.  How funny is Club Southern Caddy?  He's hilarious.  All right, go ahead, Ann.  We're running out of time. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  It's so difficult.  Because you know what?  Don West is calling in in a few minutes here.  You know something?  Yeah, he is a big guy.  He is a big guy.  Why is Rick helping you with picks so you don't even have him on your team yet?  Rick will be on my team.  Actually, Rick will be on my team.  Because I know you don't want him on yours.  I could wait.  I could wait.  Why don't you want Rick?  Well, we've got to spread out the Hispanics.  We've only got two or three on the list here. 
[01:43:30]  That's all you need is him to start talking that gibberish.  Dude, I'm taking breast cancer doctor.  What?  I'm taking breast cancer doctor.  What do you know about him?  What do I know about him?  Did you see the guy?  He looked like a big guy who was athletic.  You forget.  You just look and see breast cancer doctor.  You picture breast cancer doctor.  But you're forgetting what the guy looked like.  He looked like he may have played some sports.  He's a big guy.  Looks like he could be a hitter.  All right.  Hey, Norton, you ain't even on my effing team. 
[01:44:00]  I'm trying to help you.  I'm a good little player.  You stink.  So that's my pick right there.  Breast cancer doctor.  All right.  We'll continue this maybe later or tomorrow.  All right?  All right.  The draft well underway now.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  When we get back, I think we'll be talking to Don West.  The real Don West.  Right.  None of this, you know, fake, you know.  All right.  It's the real one.  We'll leave in the studio.  Cutesy stuff.  Yeah.  And Steve the Whistler outside.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:44:30]  The guy whistles.  Boy, why didn't we get him for the Celebrity Software Game?  I know.  Every time you miss it, it went.  What is it?  What's he just whistles?  Yeah.  He won some.  Oh, really?  He won a competition.  He's the best whistler in America.  Dude, I've never learned to whistle.  Can you whistle that? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, Don West is on the line.  We got to.  Oh, no.  We got to go right to Don West.  No, no, no.  We got a break.  We'll be back with Don West.  This is going to be very careful.  Whip him of Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this fine Whip him out Wednesday.  Yes, yes, yes.  Seems like a lot of wowing is going on today.  We could spend the whole show just going to that.  It's a beautiful day and people love doing it. 
[01:45:30]  Whip him out Wednesday.  But right now, let's go right to the phone.  Oh, yeah.  One of our favorites on the phone.  Don West.  Hello there.  Don, how are you, man?  I'm doing great.  Let me tell you something.  Listen, right now, you are one of my favorites ever.  I used to watch that shop at home and just be hypnotized.  You were hypnotic selling the cards.  So you were staying up there later?  Of course. 
[01:46:00]  And you know I wasn't alone.  There's so many people that would just watch it because of Don West.  You'd be on there just screaming your head off about these cards.  And I felt like I wanted a call.  Like you made it sound like the best, it's the best deal ever.  It was the best deal ever.  And I'd be like, I've got to have that.  I've got to have it.  And then you'd say like, hey, give me three minutes on the clock.  And the clock would keep going. 
[01:46:30]  The clock would go for ten more minutes there, Don.  And I'd be freaking out like maybe I should call.  But then I missed the deal and I'd start feeling good about myself.  But I felt like I missed what you would call the best deal ever.  And then you'd bring up the next deal and go, if you wasted your money on that last thing, you're crazy.  This is the best one ever.  And all over again I'm there.  It's four in the morning, five in the morning.  I've got to get to sleep, Don West.  It was amazing. 
[01:47:00]  And then when you left, I was like, I couldn't watch it.  Couldn't watch it anymore.  I couldn't watch it anymore.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  I heard that from a lot of people.  I bet you have.  Hey, Don, you've got to give us a little bit, though.  Okay.  Give us something.  And that Don West voice of yours.  I'll tell you what, the opening of these shows is unbelievable.  There are a couple Jim and Tins.  Jim and Tins.  I love it.  Hey, Don.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  What was up with that goddamn McGuire rookie card?  I swear to God, it seemed like there were a million or six million of these things, a hundred million of them out there.  But you made everyone sound special.  Well, I'll tell you what, at one point in 98, it was special.  Yeah, it was it?  Yeah.  And then, you know, of course, like anything, and, you know, in the collectible business, you know, it can go up or down.  But, yeah, I remember that, you know, in 96, 97, it was an $8 card. 
[01:48:00]  And then it became a $5,000 card, and now it's back down again, you know.  Yeah, so many of them got out there, but every night, we're going to throw in the McGuire.  Look, I opened the pack.  There's a McGuire rookie.  I can't believe it.  Hey, you've got to go with what's selling, buddy.  You would lose your mind.  You'd open up the pack.  Give me a pack.  I'm opening it right now.  And you'd open the thing up, and almost your head would almost explode when you would see what's going on. 
[01:48:30]  All right, I'm thumbing through.  There's going to be, you don't know what you're going to get, but you're guaranteed to get something that's going to be worth a lot more than you paid for it.  Oh, I used to have people call in, and then, he's going to have a heart attack, or get him off the cocaine, or, you know, whatever, you know.  You're going to be able to open up your own card store.  That was my favorite one, where you just had, like, everything.  We'll even throw in the cash register.  We got a guy on the line, Dave.  He said he bought so much stuff from you, Don, that he even bought Beanie Babies. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, I don't even think, you know, that's a chapter in my life I try to forget.  Yeah, they kind of...  The same as one year, I sold more Beanie Babies, probably, than anybody other than the manufacturer.  You know something?  When you first got on the Shop at Home, they had you selling other things besides just the sports memorabilia.  So, when I tune in and saw you, it's Flopsy-Wopsy the Bunny.  Flopsy-Wopsy.  I want to eat me up with that.  Hey, Doug, how much is Smoochie going for today?  It was classic. 
[01:49:30]  You had to friggin' watch this guy.  Just amazing.  And then, I've heard all kinds of rumors and whatnot.  What happened?  You were the most popular guy on, I think, any of the home shopping network-type channels.  And then, all of a sudden, boom, you're gone.  Not a word about it.  What happened?  Well, you know, there's not really much to say.  They had a big change in management.  Yeah.  But who wouldn't like you?  Well, it wasn't necessarily that. 
[01:50:00]  I was ready to, I was wanting to move on, and I've had some, you know, other opportunities.  And then, but then, of course, you know, just, you know, contract-wise, they were like,  well, we'll pretty much pay you not to work for anybody for a while.  So, it was a win-win situation.  Oh.  There's nothing wrong with that, either.  Yeah, so they told you don't go over to the other network and start selling stuff for them.  But, you know, so we took a good, nice, long vacation and got to do some things.  And then, I started back up, and I do, like, infomercials now, sports infomercials. 
[01:50:30]  Sports infomercials.  I haven't seen any of these.  It's the same type of products.  I just do them in an infomercial form.  But the beauty is, you know, you make the tapes, and you send them all out, and they're  airing all over the country in, you know, different time slots.  Do you have a bigger piece of that than you did the, uh...  Oh, absolutely.  Nice, Don.  Absolutely.  There you go, Don.  I got to ask this, because a lot of people are calling in.  Any of the crap that you sold actually go up in value?  Oh, goodness, yes.  Oh, absolutely.  Another guy's like, how much of a scam were those cards? 
[01:51:00]  You know, I'll be honest with you, though.  It was something that I collected for 10 years.  Right.  And still do.  And so, that was, you know, it's easy selling something that you love and love doing.  Well, you could tell you knew about it, and you were passionate about it, and you were  a lunatic about it.  That's right.  And they're ball cards.  And there's not many cards that people bought years and years ago that aren't worth more  today.  You know what I mean?  So, sure, they might not be worth what they were two years ago.  And I, myself, took a bath on Griffey Jr. rookie cards. 
[01:51:30]  I was hoarding them and hoarding them and hoarding them.  And then, you know, boom, the market dropped on them.  But, hey, it could come back, you know.  Now, do they print, like, more of these things?  Is that what kind of makes the value go down?  Because how many goddamn McGuire rookie cards could there have been?  It seems like someone reprinted these goddamn things.  Hey, Don, is it also you think the card's worth more money now because years ago parents  would throw them out, like in the 50s?  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  And, well, they only had one card company, too, back then. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you know, you used to have tops alone.  And now they got, I don't know, 20 or 30.  Now you've got, you know, 500.  I mean, you've got 20 different versions in the same company, you know?  Yep, yep.  So it really gets confusing anymore.  In fact, a lot of people ask me, what do you suggest?  And I'm like, I don't even know what to tell you anymore.  Because, you know, I myself would get burned.  I would have something and I think, man, this is just the hottest crap in the world, you know?  And this is awesome.  And then all of a sudden next week you find out, oh, well, yeah, there was 500,000 of those made.  But nobody had any. 
[01:52:30]  So somebody's got all the others and all of a sudden they flood the market, you know?  You know what, though?  You could have gone anywhere with any crap card and just stand on a street corner and go, hey, people, Jim Minton, I'm selling my own card collection.  And people would buy them from you at ridiculous prices.  It's just that you have that way about you that you can sell this stuff.  Because I used to sit there.  When you brought out that Tiger Woods set, this is toward the end of your tenure there, and you were selling the Tiger Woods rookie card, it was like, I've got to get my hands on this. 
[01:53:00]  And next week this is going up in value, $80 billion gajillion dollars.  I think it's only $60 billion now.  I was off about $20 billion.  But it was like, if I didn't get to my goddamn phone, I'm missing out.  And they got a guy.  I don't know what your relationship is with the people there now, but they really are trying to make the guy on there now sound like you, and it just doesn't wash their Don.  Well, you know, they just don't have the, you know.  I mean, my opinion, he doesn't have the knowledge that I did in the field. 
[01:53:30]  And you're right, it's kind of an imitation, which, you know, I'm flattered, but I just want everybody to know that's not me out there.  Right.  Don, Anthony has done so many Don Westbeths, it's not even funny.  We've sold virgins on our show.  I remember that.  Oh, you heard that one?  I remember that, yeah.  You guys sent it over to one of our guys, and they played it.  That was the funniest kid I ever saw.  Yeah, we've been doing quite a few of those. 
[01:54:00]  Who was the guy on the phone with you?  Remember the guy that would call up?  Yeah, he was one of the vendors that supplied a lot of the product.  Because you were the rudest son of a bitch to him on the phone.  He'd be talking about something.  You'd be like, all right, I'm going to open up some cards.  You tell him about it.  I'm going to look for a, you know, and you'd be looking.  I'm going to see how many Griffey cards are in here.  And the guy would be going, Don, let me tell you something.  This is an amazing deal.  You're going to get the amount of cards you're going to, oh, my God, I found one. 
[01:54:30]  I found one.  And you'd lose your mind.  And the guy, you'd pretty much be going, shut up.  Could you swerve into a pole while you're driving your car?  It was amazing.  You were so rude.  But I was captivated, Don West.  What the hell are you doing now?  Well, like I said, I've got the commercial thing.  But the most exciting thing that I've started is this brand new wrestling pay-per-view program  that's going to be on every Wednesday night starting June 19th.  And it's the NWA presents TNA. 
[01:55:00]  TNA.  Which, of course, is total nonstop action.  But there's a little double me in there if you get my drift.  I think we can figure that out, Don West.  It's going to be unreal.  And it's going to be only, here's the beauty of it.  It's every week, same time, same place, only $9.95.  So it's not like it's, you know, I mean, that's a six-pack, you know, it's nothing.  It's not the ordinary pay-per-view price you would do.  No, not when you're going out paying $40 a pop. 
[01:55:30]  And we're going to be able to do this, you know, I mean, just, it's going to be so much,  you know, more exciting and compelling storylines.  And it's only $9.95.  It's only $9.95.  I'm telling you, folks, there is not a better pay-per-view deal.  I mean, seriously, there's not a better pay-per-view deal, period, on television.  I mean, we're going to be able to show you, and that's the beauty of it, too,  since we're only pay-per-view, every week we can show you something, shock you.  Now, that's what I want to talk to you about.  Are we going to be seeing a little risque stuff? 
[01:56:00]  Are there any women involved in that?  Oh, my God, there better be, or I've signed up for the wrong thing.  And you're going to announce?  Yes, I'm going to be one of the announcers.  That is fan-effing-tastic.  I swear to God.  I am going to check this out just to watch you announce this.  You know what?  I'll tell you what, too, and I appreciate that's why you're going to tune in,  but it's going to be so neat and funny and exciting that you're going to be hooked. 
[01:56:30]  And, you know, I won't even be that big of a part of it, you know.  But I'm going to try to get my two cents in there wherever I can.  Him just talking about, give me the phone.  I want to order right now.  I can't help it.  Let me give you the in-demand number right now.  You can get your order in.  You're turning people into zombies.  Sell it to us, Doc.  Hey, the beauty about this, you don't have to wait until 3 o'clock in the morning to watch it either.  I mean, this is 8 o'clock at night, buddy.  8 o'clock.  Hey, who did you get to wrestle?  Oh, they've got all kinds of difference, and they're doing every day on the website, 
[01:57:00]  somebody news now, but just, you know, kind of along your genre that you're going to love,  like some of the people they've signed, it's like, Puppet the Psycho Dwarf.  I kid you not.  Puppet the Psycho Dwarf.  This is out of this world.  The Psycho Dwarf, the meanest, baddest little SOB you ever saw.  Does he hit people with a dryer door?  What's that?  No, don't mind Jimmy Norton.  He's just one of our guys.  Well, that's just some of the fun things, but I mean, you know, the World's Ultimate Fighter, 
[01:57:30]  Ken Shamrock's on there, and they're signing every day.  In fact, you know, like I've just recently signed, but every day they're released.  They're not even letting me know.  You've got to pretty much go to the website, and they release them every day, you know,  some of the different people.  But it's going to be totally different.  I mean, it's going to be like what people have seen before, but yet so much different.  And like I said, you know, we're going to push the envelope.  I mean, I'm not lying.  We are going to push the envelope.  That's what we want to say.  Don, you still got the same hairdo?  Yeah, I still got the same.  I got a goatee now, though. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, you got the goat now going.  I got the goatee going, but yeah, I still got the same old 1950s hair or whatever it is.  Business up front, rock and roll in the back.  Yes, absolutely.  All right.  I'm going to keep it until it comes back in.  The Texas tailgate.  I love it.  I love it, Don.  Well, let me tell you something.  It has just been a pleasure talking to you, and we want to talk about it.  I want to talk to you again, maybe in the future, and good luck with this wrestling thing.  What else are you selling, though, as far as on these infomercials?  Well, I'm doing basically more generic sports packages of a type that, well, just because of, you know, what I learned in the past, 
[01:58:30]  instead of coming out with something individual and saying, hey, get this Jim Minton Jeter,  because it's going to be, you know, if it doesn't go there, you know, you get the hassle of people calling and saying,  hey, you know, I bought this card thinking it was going to be.  So what I'm doing now, you know, and learned is I'm selling so much more generic packages to where, you know,  just the big boxes of, you know, 500 unopened packs. 
[01:59:00]  And you just don't know what the hell you're going to get.  Yeah, well, everybody's is different, and no matter what, it's worth the $59 or the $99 you pay for it,  and that's the beauty.  None of them are being returned.  I mean, it's a no-brainer.  It's a no-brainer, baby.  We got the Mike Piazza I'm Not a Homo card.  Don, it's been great talking to you.  He's got to sell our show a little bit more.  You want him to sell it a little more?  Well, no, our show.  Oh, sell our show. 
[01:59:30]  All right, Don.  Don, give us a little more Opie and Anthony stuff.  We're pretty much two jackasses, and we'll use it in a promo.  We'll use it in a promo.  Just sell our show a little bit.  Folks, if you're driving in your car right now and you're not listening to the Opie and Anthony radio show,  you're a loser!  You're a loser, baby!  You better get on the radio right now and dial in, because they are the best.  And if you don't like what they're saying, then you're a boring person anyway.  Bravo, Don. 
[02:00:00]  Seriously, though, guys, NWATNA, total nonstop action on Wednesday night, starting June 19th.  Catch it.  And what's the website?  Real fast.  NWATNA.com.  There you go.  Okay.  Don, pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  After the first show, I'll call you back, and you can give me some stuff about it.  Absolutely, because I think we're going to pull some sound clips of you, my friend.  Take care, buddy.  Take it easy, Don.  Bye-bye, guys.  Oh, wait, wait. 
[02:00:30]  What?  Oh, no.  You got Don West, you bastard.  And I didn't think you got him.  He got me.  He got me.  He got me.  He got me.  He is great, though.  I can't believe it.  We found Anthony doing Don West selling the Beanie Babies.  Title, since Don has the go-team, does that mean he's the evil Don West?  I'm evil, Dad.  As we go to break, Anthony has Don West selling Beanie Babies.  Boy, what a brilliant move.  Ty, that makes the Beanie Babies, say that they're discontinuing all of the Beanie Babies. 
[02:01:00]  They're going to retire all of them.  Retiring them, that's it.  These things have been selling like hotcakes.  And now, you know what's going to happen?  They're going to sell even more.  And you know what will probably happen?  They're not going to discontinue them.  They'll just come out with new ones.  Right.  Forget about it.  You're going to see it on E-Trade.  You're going to be seeing it on...  I'll tell you where you're going to see it.  Home shopping.  Oh, the home shopping guy.  Does the guy sell the Beanie Babies?  His frigging head's going to explode. 
[02:01:30]  Beanie Babies.  Beanie Babies, people.  These are all going to be discontinued.  Order now.  Buy them all.  Oh, his head's going to explode, man, with the Beanie Babies being retired?  I think so.  Beanie Babies, because he's always eating a fuzzy wuzzy, you flopsy-wopsie.  Yeah.  Look at this one.  Clubby the Seal.  Clubby the Seal, people.  Baby Seal with a little clop. 
[02:02:00]  Discontinued.  How about Nettie the Dolphin?  Nettie the Dolphin, never again.  And a McGuire rookie card thrown in.  Plus the entire Topps 86 series.  My God.  Look at this cute little booger.  Snatchy the Bearded Clam.  Where are you going to find Snatchy the Bearded Clam, people?  Order now. 
[02:02:30]  Limit a ten.  Call a hundred times.  Buy a thousand.  My God.  Look at the whole International Beanie Baby set.  Here it is from Mexico, Dirty Sanchez.  Look at the Beanie Baby.  It's a scratch and sniff.  Where have you seen this one?  And his little friend playing the rusty trombone.  Are you going to throw in a Ken Griffey rookie card?  A Griffey rookie card!  I was watching the other day, and he was selling Ken Griffey mistake rookie cards. 
[02:03:00]  It's a mistake, look.  They spelled Griffey with an X.  There was no picture on front.  That's not a card!  Well, you still have the Ken Griffey on the back with all the stats, but it was a mistake  in the factory, and it's just a blank piece of cardboard.  It's just white in front because they forgot to put the picture in.  So he's calling a mistake rookie card.  It's going to be so valuable.  You better get your hands on these things.  The price of this one, it just looks like a piece of cardboard. 
[02:03:30]  But it was supposed to have Babe Ruth's rookie card on it.  Right.  Don't matter that it says Hostess Twinkies on the back of it.  I swear it's worth millions.  Then he gets on ten minutes later.  Look at this knife I'm selling.  Goddamn, I cut myself.  Didn't he even cut himself once?  Yeah, he did.  He cut himself on a knife.  He had to leave the show that night.  I'm so excited.  Oh, my God.  I thrust it through my heart.  For the love of God. 
[02:04:00]  I love that guy.  It started as an idea.  I have a dream.  Then the people got behind it.  United, there is little we cannot do.  Now, we can all live the dream.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Keeping the dream alive.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:04:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Rob, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I just got wowed by some chick, and she wanted me to pull over.  She came down my street, and she said something to me, and I pulled in my driveway,  and I saw her stop at the corner, and she was kind of looking and creasing.  I wondered if I could get down the air.  Hold on, hold on.  Rob, you're breaking up really bad, but you're saying you got wowed for the first time in Cleveland?  That's right. 
[02:05:00]  Congratulations, Rob.  Very good for Rob.  And then he's giving out addresses I had to dump out of that.  Yeah, I don't even know what he was up to.  And Eddie!  Yeah, what up, kid?  What's up, Eddie?  Real fast.  So I got wowed by three chicks in the Mustang, dog, in the L.I.E., baby.  Woo!  There you go.  You can take calls like that all day.  All day.  All you need to do is slap that wow on your vehicle and just drive.  That's it.  There you have it.  Before you know it, all breasts.  All right, well, the next segment might get a little uncomfortable. 
[02:05:30]  Dude.  Shut that door.  Why is it open?  Why is Stinky pounding the ground?  Stinky, what do you got so far?  I can't wait.  This is going to be great.  Stinky, you've been out there now.  Yeah.  And how long has the Whistler been out there?  Since 3 o'clock.  So it's been...  Three hours.  Three hours.  Come on, our show.  The Whistler's been out there.  Dude, dude, I was going to take a leak. 
[02:06:00]  He comes out of the bathroom and he's wiping his hands off.  So apparently he washed his hands and...  Steve's coming in.  Hold on.  So he goes to shake my hand.  I'm like, well, I like a man that washes his hands.  I go...  And I pointed to the no S zone sign that is now on our bathroom door.  I had to put the sign up after yesterday.  It says no S-H, you know, on the door.  And I said, you didn't...  And I pointed to the sign.  He goes, no, no, no.  Whistler...  And all this dead serious.  He goes, Whistler has to drink a lot of water. 
[02:06:30]  And I've been drinking a lot of water.  Yeah, a Whistler.  He calls himself Whistler.  He goes, a Whistler.  Like, they're all over.  Vanity plates.  Yeah, I know.  He goes, has to drink a lot of water.  And I've been drinking since, you know, for a couple of hours now.  Like, oh, cool.  You know what else a Whistler has to do?  Give up all claims to box.  So then, you know, I go to the bathroom.  I come out.  And he goes, my card. 
[02:07:00]  And he gives me his card.  Right.  Steve the Whistler.  International champion.  So I look.  And, of course, I have to go, well, international champion.  And he goes, well, since that card's been printed, I'm now international grand champion.  Dude, deadly, deadly serious.  Deadly serious.  So basically, we're going to be talking to the best Whistler in the world. 
[02:07:30]  Dude.  Please.  He's got a CD out called Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler.  Herps.  Hold on.  Opie, use all your talents and power to describe that album cover.  You have to.  Give me that thing.  Give me that thing.  Okay.  He's right outside.  Be quiet.  The disc.  Why?  I love when it gets uncomfortable here.  It better be turned down.  This is getting a little out of control. 
[02:08:00]  It's turned down, right?  Everyone is in the studio.  No one wants to hang out outside.  Dude.  No, Rick is C-blocking for us right now.  It says, Broadway and Beyond.  Steve the Whistler.  Herbst.  International champion.  And then there's a picture of him.  Okay.  His lips pursed in the whistling fashion.  He almost has, I guess the closest thing you could say is a slight Joey Buttafuoco look. 
[02:08:30]  Would you say that?  Was this some of him?  Yeah.  He is.  Uh-oh.  A CD that's skipping.  On the cover.  Oh, no.  He is standing on what looks to be a, the backdrop is Broadway.  And he has his hands out like a, an opera star, tenor or something would, would have if he  was singing.  He's in a suit with a red bow tie.  And he's whistling on the cover.  You see his lips are like this.  He's whistling.  On the back though, it's the cash, Steve the Whistler. 
[02:09:00]  He's sporting a sweater and some pants and cowboy boots as he is reclining on the back  of his Aurora.  What is that?  A Buick?  Yeah.  His Buick Aurora showing his New York license plate that says, Whistler.  Whistler.  He's like, it looks right out of some, like, turn off on Long Island somewhere, New York.  As he said, did you see the back of this yet, Jimmy?  Yep. 
[02:09:30]  Look.  All right, let's listen.  Let's listen to a Steve the Whistler.  All right.  What song is this, Opie?  What track?  Oh, you'll know.  Oh, I will?  Yeah.  Memories from Cats.  Wow.  Sounds like Zamphir, Master of the Pan Flute. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Every dog in Manhattan has his head slightly tilted 45 degrees.  Looking about, confused.  I was going to whistle along.  Incidentally, this picture where he's reclining, you would actually look more masculine if you  were reclining on a mule. 
[02:10:30]  What's that, Stinky?  He's ready to come in.  Oh, is he?  Okay, let's get to Steve.  All right.  Now, people.  People on the phones, we might need your help.  So, serious questions only.  Yeah, let's, no fooling around today.  We want a serious interview, so we're looking for serious questions only.  Questions only.  With Steve and the Whistler.  And to the phone screener, please, when you type the serious questions only, use code words  so he does not look over at the screen.  All right.  Let's start. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Let's welcome Steve the Whistler onto the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm whistling a little to welcome him.  Don't whistle in front of him.  I don't.  I don't want to, like, clap my hands and go, whistling, because it might be wrong.  I might be doing it wrong.  Yep.  Now, I found out Jimmy Norton, Opie, doesn't know how to whistle.  No, maybe Steve could teach a little Jimmy Norton how to whistle.  You got a Whistler hat, do you?  And so, with a little musical note on it, I was just going, whistling, whistling.  You know, that's one of the ways I whistle. 
[02:11:30]  I was pursing my lips trying to whistle, and I just can't do it.  Hey, Steve.  Thanks for your card.  Thank you.  Steve giving Opie one of his cards.  And Opie, if I might tell you.  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Oh, SteveTheWhistler.com.  If I might tell you, Opie, where it says Steve the Whistler Herbst, and then it says  International Champion, I was informed.  Well, let Steve tell.  Steve, you are not just the International Champion.  No, I'm actually the International Grand Champion.  Grand Champion.  Now, what does that entail?  Well, we have an international competition, the third week. 
[02:12:00]  And third weekend in April, down in Lewisburg, North Carolina.  North Carolina.  And people come from how far reaching?  Well, this year, the guy who got the award for coming the furthest was from India.  India.  And was he a good whistler?  The highest arc.  He was very good.  He was very good.  But he's no, you know, Steve, the Whistler.  Well, he didn't make it to the finals.  He didn't.  Now, what are people looking for when they're judging whistling? 
[02:12:30]  Well, you have a panel of judges, most of whom are musical educators.  And this year, we had a couple of former champion whistlers.  And they're looking for a degree of difficulty of the piece you're doing.  So, if you're just doing something that's kind of easy, not a lot of note changes, they might not look at that as seriously as somebody who's doing a lot of note changes and dynamics.  Right.  Things like that.  That wouldn't be considered competitive.  Right.  Do a lot of people enter these contests, Steve?  How many people?  Well, we have kids, teens, and adults competing. 
[02:13:00]  And this year, we had 31 adults.  And of that, we had seven women and 24 men.  Now, you were first place in classical music?  Yes.  What kind of songs would you do classically?  Well, this year, in the preliminary round, I did Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy.  Clair de Lune.  Clair de Lune.  Yes, Clair de Lune.  And in the final round, I did Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt.  I don't think I've heard that one. 
[02:13:30]  I probably would know it as something else, right?  You would definitely know it as something else.  As a matter of fact, it's probably been used in a lot of animated cartoons.  Oh, well, then I probably did hear it.  Can you give us a little piece of that?  So maybe we could know what that's like.  I don't know if he's warmed up, Anthony.  I kind of want to hear...  No, he's warmed up.  Oh, you're warmed up there, Steve?  Yeah.  He was whistling for me.  I was whistling out there in the lobby, yeah.  Now, is this the music for it?  This is the accompanying music.  The accompanying music.  I have a question, though.  Yes, Jimmy?  Would all the whistlers laugh if a stroke victim entered? 
[02:14:00]  I'm sorry, what was that?  Oh, well, let's play...  You're a horrible man.  Let's play Steve's music.  Let's hear.  Let's hear the music.  And we'll let Steve go.  And see if we recognize him.  You didn't know you were going to have so much intro, huh? 
[02:14:30]  Well, I'm enjoying it.  It's pretty.  And I do recognize him.  It's quite pretty.  Uh-oh.  Very good. 
[02:15:00]  It sounds like an instrument. 
[02:15:30]  That's very good.  How long is this song?  Too long for this. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  But that's a very good demonstration.  Thank you.  Of that song, there's a lot of dynamic to that.  Very talented.  Now, how the hell do you figure out you can do this so well?  A lot of practice behind this?  Yes.  Yeah?  Years and years of practice.  It's like, how do you get to Carnegie Hall?  Practice.  Practice, they say.  Now, how old were you when you first took this interest in whistling?  About seven or eight.  Seven or eight.  And did your dad maybe whistle around the house?  As a matter of fact, he did whistle, especially in the car whenever we went places, and that's 
[02:16:30]  how I got started.  And you'd join in and whistle along with dad.  They didn't have Little League in your town?  Yeah, actually, they did.  Steve, do you get a little ribbing about the whistling?  Oh, sure.  You do?  Sure.  Do you perform live?  I do perform live.  What kind of venues would we be able to catch you at?  I have had occasion to whistle at Avery Fisher Hall, Carnegie Hall.  At Carnegie Hall. 
[02:17:00]  You took the stage at Carnegie Hall and whistled.  Yeah.  And I would whistle up at West Point with the cadets.  Yeah.  And, you know, different...  Actually, one of the funniest things, I was hired by Lohman's...  Yes, please.  Lohman's Department.  Okay.  Okay.  Lohman's Department store.  They hired me to whistle at the retirement dinner of their chairman.  Really?  Did they pick a wacky song?  No, actually, we had to pick his favorite songs.  What was some of his favorites?  Oh, New York, New York, Greensleeves, Impossible Dream. 
[02:17:30]  Do you do any songs that you wouldn't ordinarily think a whistler should be doing?  Any newer songs or something that kids might like, listen to?  Well, actually, one of the ones that you probably wouldn't expect is Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder.  Stevie Wonder, Sir Duke.  Maybe we could get a little of that, Rick, if you could pop that in, the musical accompaniment.  And Steve the Whistler Herbst will now whistle along...  Can't wait.  ...to Sir Duke.  Stevie Wonder, you remember this. 
[02:18:00]  Stop it, Opie.  People are going to think it's him.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Come on in here.  Stop it.  Let's sing along.  Everyone's warm.  Oh, it went off. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, babe.  You're ruining it.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy?  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  Stop.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, yeah.  Stop it, Opie.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Thank you.  Okay.  Stop.  Would you stop?  I didn't do a whistler.  Beautiful.  That's a, that's a talent.  You're, uh...  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Your lips must, uh, cramp up like a $5 hooker, though, sometimes, huh? 
[02:19:30]  You ever have that, uh, happen to you?  If I whistle long enough, they do get tired.  They do get tired.  How long, uh, would a performance be that they wouldn't just freeze up on you?  It ever happen to you?  And you go, uh-oh.  Not in a performance, no.  I can't go on, no?  Have you ever, do you ever do this just to be silly, though?  Like, you ever been giving oral treats to a girl and then just stop and whistle so it  sounds like she's falling off a building?  Well, this isn't going so well.  Oh, Pete. 
[02:20:00]  Okay.  I didn't do anything that time.  Steve, does it annoy you if, like, when Opie started whistling over you?  That's got to be tough.  No, I...  Only if people thought it was me.  Yeah, see?  That's what I was thinking.  Like, people are going to think that...  I thought I did pretty well.  You did horribly.  You did horribly.  What do you think of Opie's whistling?  It wasn't even on key.  Well, yeah.  It's just to the day job.  Yeah.  Very good.  Well, the phones are alight with people that want to learn more about whistling.  Why can't I whistle?  It's so annoying.  I cannot whistle.  Hey, maybe you could teach Jimmy. 
[02:20:30]  Jimmy Norton can't whistle.  Give it a try.  I swear to God, I have the worst.  It's with my weak chin and little percy lips.  I can't whistle, and I never...  Like you're waiting for a mama bird to regurgitate something into your mouth.  Or an Asian man to put his C in there.  What is he doing wrong?  He's blowing too hard.  Oh.  Well, I've been kicked out of many a car for that.  I want to ask Al Dukes if it's true that he had the flu during the fight on Friday. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, Al Dukes.  Well, how do I do it?  Use your ears.  How do I do it?  It sounds just like him, man.  Hey, Ryan, what's up?  Yes.  Ryan.  Hello, guys.  What's up?  We're talking to Steve the Whistler.  I can hear it.  I've been whistling for the last 20 minutes in the car.  He's fabulous.  Is it great?  I need to know his opinion on something.  Because there's nothing worse than when you have a profession associated with something bad.  And I'd like to know what he thinks about the following saying. 
[02:21:30]  Whistle while you work.  Hitler was a jerk.  Mussolini was a meanie.  But the Japs were worse.  Steve, what do you think?  What do I think about that statement?  What the hell was that?  I don't know, but Whistle while you work is a nice song.  It probably is, right?  Especially if you're murdering Shondra Levy.  You know something?  I want to apologize, Steve, for that man because he doesn't have any class or couth and he can't appreciate some of the arts. 
[02:22:00]  I'm not knocking and whistling.  I just think it would be funny to whistle a tune while you're digging a grave and dumping a body into it.  Steve, he's a traveling comedian and he's in New York City this weekend and we don't have an association with him at all.  So don't mind him, he's from L.A.?  Don't mind him.  You're from L.A.?  Not originally, no, Akron.  Akron, okay.  Let's go to Aaron.  Home of the Beacon Journal.  Yes, Aaron.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Aaron.  How are you guys doing today?  On the phone with Steve, the Whistler Herbst.  Hey, good afternoon, Steve.  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  So you've been whistling for quite a while, huh? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah, for like 48 years.  Wow.  Have you acquired the ability to whistle with large objects in your mouth?  You ever try any trick whistling like that, I guess is what you're trying to get at?  That's a good question, yes.  No, but actually I can whistle several different ways, including in as well as out.  Stop.  Oh, let's hear a little of that.  Let's hear a little in whistling.  Well, see if you can hear the difference.  Okay.  All right.  Everyone listen. 
[02:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  I hear a difference.  It's a little more woodwind sounding on the end.  Wait, when did he change?  I heard him change.  It was just a slight difference.  Where did you change, Steve?  He might have been watching.  That would be a giveaway.  Was it?  Oh, I wasn't supposed to tell?  You might have been cheating.  I didn't want to watch.  I wanted to try to tell.  Okay.  I'll get up with my ears.  Try it again, and I'll tell you exactly when you change.  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  Do a different song?  I'm not looking.  I'm going to try it.  Do a different one.  Do a different one.  Now!  No!  Oh, you jack-off!  No!  Try it again.  No, you dumb bunny!  Try it again!  Okay, go ahead.  I'm not watching.  He's whistling in already. 
[02:24:00]  That's out.  Did you whistle in there?  You know something?  God bless you.  I didn't even notice that time.  I think it was that I was watching the first time.  Well, the idea is to be able to keep going, you know, without having to stop for the...  Yeah, for the breath.  Why can't I do it at all?  You can't do it at all.  Because you have a life.  Oh, God, look at your nothing lips trying so hard.  It might be genetic.  I don't know.  It could be genetic.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  You see, you blow it too hard.  See, stop.  Don't blow so hard.  When I do it, nothing comes out.  My little empty...  I have a Down syndrome tongue.  Just lols.  Look at his face.  Levi, what's up?  Levi, there's a theory out that you need to be able to curl your tongue to...  See, that's what I was saying that before.  And then we just, you know, did something with each other's shees and we forgot about it.  Steve, a lot of people want to know what you lubricate your lips with. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  Is there any special lip care that you need?  Soft and supple.  Well, basically, you know, a lip balm helps and water.  Oh, water.  Lip balm and water.  Who knew?  Levi.  The recipe of champions.  What's going on?  Yes, yes.  Levi.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, I was wondering if this guy knows anything to do with upbeat classics like maybe some  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Wow, that would be rough.  You ever try Flight of the Bumblebee?  I haven't, and that's not one of the ones in my repertoire.  Yeah, that would be a tough one. 
[02:25:30]  However, the Hungarian Rhapsody later on in the piece is very up-tempo.  I'll have to listen to that.  Can you do Shall We Dance as your helicopters are shooting at Asians?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  I was wondering if you ever whistled at NeonDyslexia.com before.  Oh, dude, what kind of plug is that?  I'm trying to plug a website.  The website is SteveTheWhistler.com.  Yeah, let's go to WellHung.  WellHung.  Hey, Steve, it sounds like it bends more when you're whistling in. 
[02:26:00]  A what?  It sounds like it bends more when it's whistling in.  Like it bends more?  Yeah, the notes.  Actually, I got a request for Steve.  That is quite a pure sound, actually.  Ah, ooh.  Steve, can you whistle?  I feel pretty and dedicated to little Jimmy Norton.  Well, yes, and actually that's on the CD, on my CD, Broadway Beyond.  Oh, you got a CD.  Broadway and Beyond, I Feel Pretty from West Side Story, of course.  There's a medley from West Side Story, and I Feel Pretty is one of the tunes. 
[02:26:30]  I Feel Pretty.  Let's take a listen to that, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, it's part of the medley, though.  WellHung wants to say something else.  Yes, WellHung?  How's your mom?  Whistler's mother is fine.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah, well, you know, we hear that.  She's fine in Florida with a lot of moms.  Why would he say that?  Whistler's mother.  It's a painting.  I thought you were a comedian.  I am, but I don't do Whistler's mother's painting jokes.  He's horrid.  I'm not a very good one.  His name is Rich Voss, and he's awful. 
[02:27:00]  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Chandra.  Oh, jeez.  See, Steve doesn't want to go there.  It's a wholesome thing he does, and let's keep it that way.  He doesn't want to be dragged down to your level.  Whistle while you bury interns.  Do-da.  Do-da.  You're not funny now.  You're not even funny.  Sorry.  Sorry.  All right, Steve, are you going to be performing any time soon?  Any performances coming up, Steve?  Actually, no.  A week or so ago, I sang with the University Glee Club of New York City. 
[02:27:30]  The Glee Club.  Of which, I've been a member for 24 years in Alice Tully Hall a week ago, and next fall,  I expect we'll be doing a recital with my wife, because she and I...  Oh, what does she do?  Well, she used to be a professional singer, and right now she's...  She uses her armpit.  She's a lawyer.  She's a litigator.  Does she do any backup whistling for you? 
[02:28:00]  She doesn't whistle.  Are you a single act?  Do you ever have the harmonies going on with you?  Somebody harmonizing, whistling, or anything?  Yeah, that happens.  Oh, yeah?  That happens.  I just want to know what kind of...  You know what I can expect if I ever go to a performance.  Steve, thank you so much for coming down here and enlightening us a bit on whistling.  Well, could he leave us with a little more...  You want to leave with a little number?  A little ditty?  Sure.  You want to hear...  Which one?  Which one?  How about Maria from West Side Story?  Maria from West Side Story.  Well, I guess we can...  You remember that? 
[02:28:30]  All right, hold on.  Very popular Broadway tune.  All right, here we go.  It's Steve the Whistler's.  First, first, you still got the Aurora?  I do.  You do have the Aurora.  I do.  That is some sexy pose you got going there, Stephen.  Yeah, I thought it was fun.  All right.  It's all about fun, Anthony.  And was that picture taken out on Long Island?  No, that picture was taken in Putnam.  Really?  I thought it was D.C., because if you look under the tire, I think that's his Chandra's skull.  Look, he's dragging me in to his debauchery. 
[02:29:00]  You made him happy again.  Look, he laughs at me, see?  I did enjoy that.  There we go.  Rubbing a tug and we all laugh.  Okay.  Just went there to further herself and live a dream.  Ha, ha, ha.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to the CD?  It didn't skip.  Rick.  Oh, my God.  Who happened?  Put it in the...  Steve, I'm sorry. 
[02:29:30]  You put it in the wrong one, dude.  No, no.  Something happened to CD4.  All right.  If that wasn't working last time, I'm sorry.  SteveTheWhistler.com.  Maria.  Which one is this?  Maria from West Side Story.  All right.  Here we go again.  Steve The Whistler.  Steve The Whistler.  What the hell is going on with the CD?  Dude, you got it.  That's the third time you've had a problem with that one.  Clean it.  This is the same one that was skipping earlier.  Put it in the other one. 
[02:30:00]  But take the CD and rub it on your helmet.  I'll try CD2.  Steve The Whistler.  I'll look.  I'll look because I think...  Here we go.  From West Side Story.  Steve, I'm embarrassed.  What the hell is wrong with this, Rick? 
[02:30:30]  You want to reset it?  Turn it off and turn it on.  And can you turn it off from the back there?  I'm doing it.  I'm holding the button down.  I'm holding the button.  Track four, right?  No, track nine.  Steve, I'm sorry.  Track nine.  It'll work now, though, I guarantee, because I saw the light on here,  and I pressed the breaker.  Yeah, nine.  Nine.  I'm sorry, Steve.  It's okay.  Here we go.  Steve The Whistler.  I'm holding it down. 
[02:31:00]  It popped.  Dude, it popped.  Maybe it's a CD.  It popped.  Steve, you got another CD, dude, because it was fine before.  You played other stuff on the CD.  It was fine.  Steve, you got another copy of the CD?  Damn it.  Did you burn this one yourself, Steve?  Yeah, Steve's getting another copy.  Oh, Steve, I see the problem.  Look.  Look at the back of this thing.  It's all smudged and stuff.  You got some cleaner?  I'm back. 
[02:31:30]  Steve, you got some cleaner?  I don't have any.  You got any clear stuff to rub on that?  No, here.  Give it to me.  No, give it to me.  I'll try to clean it with my shirt.  This happens.  Make sure you're putting it in the one that I was pressing the button on in the back.  All right.  Let's try this.  Oh, God.  A, not B.  This is embarrassing, and this is not the way to run a goddamn radio station.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Steve the Whistler.  I'm sorry, Steve. 
[02:32:00]  Damn it.  You know, we can try a different CD with a different kind of thing.  All right, let me try this.  I want to hear this song.  It sounds beautiful, and there seems to be a problem with the CD player. 
[02:32:30]  Steve?  It's not all dollars and cents.  What's wrong, Steve?  No, I was saying you were playing the Broadway and Beyond CD before, weren't you?  I thought I heard it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yep, yep, yep.  But it was skipping.  It was skipping.  Skipping.  The first track was skipping a little.  Is it our equipment?  Because then I would really be...  Flabbergasted.  It's mortified.  Let's try it again here.  All right.  One more time. 
[02:33:00]  That's not going.  It's stuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Nice tone, though, right?  Yeah, that was.  I apologize.  All right.  Well, Steve, I think we're going to have to just take your word for it.  Well, either that or do something acapella.  What do you have?  Do you have another CD of music?  Yeah.  Maybe you can do another tune?  Sure.  Rick, get that one.  Can I?  Because it might just be the CD. 
[02:33:30]  Do you like this one, Angel?  Yeah.  Can I have that?  Not that one.  That's the...  That's where we went beyond.  Can I have the CD?  No.  Look.  I'm going to...  I'll check the button in the back.  All right.  We solved that problem. 
[02:34:00]  Where did everyone go?  What's wrong with you, Ben?  Steve, I worked with a bunch of lunatics.  I'm sorry.  I don't know where Anthony went.  I don't know where Ben went.  Garrett, you all right?  Jim, why would you look at Steve?  I have no problem looking at Steve.  It's you I don't want to look at.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Well, if this works, we'll be doing music of the night from Phantom of the Opera. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, we're doing...  Oh, ready?  Track nine there, Steve?  Steve.  Say goodbye to your tea styles, everyone.  Oh, Steve the Whistler.  Shh, shh, shh.  All right.  Sounds like it's working.  He's got a website, stevethewhistler.com.  Yeah.  International Grand Champion.  Shh, shh, shh.  Here it comes.  Second...  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh. 
[02:35:00]  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  We got farther that time.  Yeah, but this CD player is just ridiculous.  Do you know the theme from Titanic?  Do you do that one?  No, you don't do that one.  It would probably be a good number for you to do.  It's very popular.  Oh, I know.  You know what I mean.  The uncle one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You do that one?  No.  That's a very popular number.  Why didn't you learn that one? 
[02:35:30]  Ah.  And it sounds very fitting to what you do.  Yes, Jim.  I would...  Would it be possible, could you whistle singing in the rain while I'm raping a girl?  You know, you're trying to be outrageous.  You do this every time you hear, and it's not...  I don't know why we have you back.  It's not washing.  I...  You know what he...  Do you remember a comic named Andrew Dice Clay?  Sure.  He used to tour with him, and I think it rubbed off on him.  Instead of trying to be original and do what he does, he's got to be outrageous and make 
[02:36:00]  jokes like that about other people's expenses.  And I'm really getting a little tired of it, Jim.  Steve...  This thing just reminds me of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Yeah.  Right.  And he's all three except for the good.  Guess who the good guy is here.  I don't know.  Should be the good, the bad, the positive.  Oh.  I can almost hear...  I see Clint right up there.  Steve.  Oh, look.  There's a grave marker, but it's not for the money.  It's in Washington Park. 
[02:36:30]  Steve.  Steve.  No, Steve.  You turned your mic off.  I did.  Yeah.  It's on.  Son of a...  You mean that didn't get on, the good, bad, and the ugly?  Part of it did.  Oh, my God.  Part of it did.  Try it again from the top.  Did you hit the...  Yeah, you hit the mic on the thing.  It's going off by itself, this mic. 
[02:37:00]  The mic's going off by itself.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Someone's got water there.  She popped off...  Yesterday, someone spilled water there.  Who took the CD player?  No, Steve.  Hold the on button down, and it should work fine.  That's what we...  There's like a loose connection over there sometimes.  We rarely use that microphone.  They should put you on mic four.  Try it again.  Did we find another CD with the other song?  Not one that...  It doesn't work?  Not one that's not...  Great.  Professional.  Okay.  Welcome to New York City Radio and National Syndication. 
[02:37:30]  You need a boombox in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  That would work.  Oh, you know why, Ian?  It's a CD-R.  The CD-Rs don't...  The Denon's say sometimes.  Yeah, the Denon's CD-Rs don't read in these machines sometimes.  We have one in here that does read that.  Well, these are old Denon's, and that's why.  Do we have a boombox, though?  Can I come in with one on his shoulder?  All right.  You know, I think we've got to get Steve the Whistler out of here.  All right.  Steve, again, I'm a fan, and your music is beautiful.  I appreciate you coming down, and I'm sorry about the technical glitches, and especially 
[02:38:00]  Jim Norton.  Well, it's been fun to be here, and...  He's really an awful man.  Hopefully, you know, if I come back again someday, we'll...  Absolutely.  ...we'll work out the technical difficulty.  Let's do that then, Steve.  Steve, thank you.  Give out the website once again.  That's www.stevethewhistler.com.  All right.  It went off the air.  The button went off.  What?  www.stevethewhistler.com.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Steve, uh...  It was Steve...  I got the Steve part.  All right.  Steve, Steve...  That's www.stevethewhistler.com.  Okay.  And the CD is Broadway and...  Broadway and Beyond.  And Broadway and...  You can act like a man!  Broadway and Beyond.  You're welcome!  Gotcha.  And, uh...  And that's that, I guess.  Steve the Whistler.  Steve, thank you so much again.  And we'll talk to you soon.  Thanks.  All right, bye.  I'm sorry I said those things.  You should be.  Uh, Rick, walk out Steve the Whistler as we go to news with... 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  With, um...  Well, I hope that works again.  Steve, thank you so much.  Thank you.  There he is.  Hey, let me shake that hand.  Very good.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you so much.  I'm sorry for the technical, uh...  Difficulties.  A little glitch.  A little glitch.  I don't understand why it couldn't happen when Jim was telling all those nasty lines there.  Thank God it's, you know, just a radio show, not a shuttle launch or something, right?  You know, because...  Yeah.  That's serious.  That's all you'd need.  Look, that's my teacher. 
[02:39:30]  Again.  You want a breakdown?  Uh, yeah, well, actually, we've got to go to our news thing.  Yeah, we're doing news and traffic.  A little while left, but thank you so much for coming in.  And again, make sure Rick has all your info so we can have you at a future date when this  stuff is working a little better, Steve.  Thank you so much.  At 628, it's time for news and traffic with Debbie.  Debbie!  What's going on on the roadways today?  Ah, yes.  It's always such a cluttered mess out there, isn't it, Debbie? 
[02:40:00]  Debbie?  Yeah.  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Debbie?  Where's Debbie?  Now he's...  Jimmy said that.  Jimmy goes, um...  Holy Jesus.  I'm sorry I said that stuff.  Shut up, you dick.  Rick, go talk to Steve so we can talk a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Make sure everything's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  When you were here, he opens beckoning to me over the...  I know. 
[02:40:30]  ...the CD.  That's when I fled my seat.  I left my seat.  I was embarrassed to be on this program.  I knew he was going to break it.  Ovi goes, Jimmy, could you hand that over?  And I'm looking at Ovi going, no, he is absolutely not going to do this.  But then I knew you did, and I got up and went behind your equipment.  Yeah, and that's what made me laugh harder, is that you just took the coward's way out and hid behind the machinery.  I can't sit here when that's going on.  When he kept turning off the...  Ben hid in a spot, like, way under the console. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, God.  When you kept turning off his music, like, right at the beginning when he started whistling, I couldn't hold a straight face.  That's why I had to leave.  I had to leave.  I went behind the equipment and cried.  My tears are back there.  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Rick?  He's still here.  He's using our phones.  You know he's calling us.  No, we like Steve the Whistler.  Is he calling somebody that's, like, going to tell him, dude, lock the door? 
[02:41:30]  He's just calling his wife to pick her up from work.  Okay, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  Do a little, uh, little traffic in, uh, D.C. Park dig news.  Yeah, it's turning out that, uh, they definitely found you on the lady today.  And it's kind of sad.  And she's not alive, as you know by now.  All right, uh, what did you do when I smashed the CD?  I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't look.  All I knew was I looked at the console and tried to...  I didn't want my back to be shaking with laughter. 
[02:42:00]  You were like, make it go away.  You had to make it go away look on your face.  It was awful.  Make it go away.  You were like, you were like, you were like three feet away from him.  And all I could see in your eyes is like, oh, please God, make it go away.  He was a nice man.  Of course.  And you smashed his CD.  You hide behind the monitors and you're...  You didn't...  Toby, you didn't look at his face after you said...  What did you do?  What did you do?  Just look in a dead stare straight ahead? 
[02:42:30]  Then he says, hey, Jim, how come you're not looking at him?  You were so like, make it go away.  I'll never forget that face.  God, that's so embarrassing.  I can't...  I can't...  I can't deal with situations like that.  I freaked out.  The best was Ann in the background with the machines.  Yeah, I'm holding the button in.  I had to leave the situation.  Co-host chortling behind the scenes.  I had to leave.  All right.  All right.  I think...  I don't know what we're doing next. 
[02:43:00]  Maybe a little, what do we learn, right?  Oh, we can do the F.U. line as we go to break.  Great.  Let's do that.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P. Anthony F.U. line.  I'd like to get big f*** you to all the ugly broads who want to be cheerleaders at the  football game for my tickets.  I expect to see decent-looking women.  F*** you.  Don't embarrass yourself.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. out there.  That's the blocker who thought by coming back to a friend's house and hanging out until 
[02:43:30]  five in the morning was going to keep me off your friend.  Well, guess what?  You lose.  Go home, fatty.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, hi, this is Scott from Seattle.  I want to get a big F.U. to Extreme Talk in Seattle, AM 1090.  They switched to country music as opposed to you guys.  We need that like another rainy day.  F.U.  End of messages.  Хорошо.  У них есть эти большие дитски.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip. 
[02:44:00]  Амрауз.  Дитски.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  Амрауз.  Дитски.  Wednesday.  Soft the hook, yo.  O.P. and A.  And we're back for just a couple of minutes here, Anthony.  We went like almost an hour without breaking, so we just messed up this whole last hour of radio.  We certainly did.  Tomorrow, we're looking forward to more girls coming down to try out to be cheerleaders in the celebrity softball game.  We'll be drafting more players tomorrow.  I want to thank Don West for calling in today. 
[02:44:30]  Dan.  And, of course, Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  What a bang-up segment that was today.  That segment was going nowhere.  Oh, stop it.  But we pulled it out in the end.  Today, I learned that when you arc in the tub, it sticks like a jellyfish.  Yes.  That's JJ from Worcester.  Mr. Blonde.  I learned Jimmy blows too hard.  Al Mack.  Today, I learned Akron is the home of the Beacon Journal. 
[02:45:00]  Jerry from Edison.  Today, I learned you can't hit the ball over Frenchie's head because everyone knows we can't fly over it.  Over French airspace.  Jersey Gary.  He learned the Chandra Levy hiding seat game is over.  Lewis Black and CeCe DeVille on tomorrow's show, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  CeCe.  And we got some great what-do-we-learns.  We're just not going to be able to get to them today.  No.  Well, maybe we can get Tony real fast.  Tony!  Tony! 
[02:45:30]  I learned no matter how bad that guy sucked, I'm not the only schmuck who's going to be whistling memories when I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  Thornton, you are the man.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, with that, we've got to get out of here.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for this.  Thank you, Boston!  Yeah, Boston.  Huge ratings today in Boston.  I just want to say that I'm happy I can now go and take a dump the length of a banana and the consistency of toothpaste. 
[02:46:00]  And that's how it ends today. </pre>
