<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the usual chaotic banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, featuring Norton's self-deprecating humor, including calling himself a "naked whore."  They recount a recent studio mishap where Opie spilled water on the mixing board, causing a major equipment malfunction likened to a groin kick, followed by a frantic repair effort by the head engineer, Tim.  The bulk of the show focuses on the upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  They detail the event's logistics, including selecting participants (described as "an all-star team of homeless" from New York and Philadelphia), bus transportation, and anticipating the chaos and listener participation.  Past anecdotes of similar events, involving showering in mall bathrooms and listener generosity, are recounted.  Broadcast details across various radio stations and a later rebroadcast are announced.  Listener calls confirm the eventâ€™s origins as an urban legend fueled by Anthony's alleged past mistreatment at the mall. A WISP (Philadelphia) caller provides updates on their search for a participant, humorously mentioning the challenges of finding a dry one.

The show also covers several other topics: identical Christmas gifts from Caroline's Comedy Club; a news story about hangover prevention; Jim Norton's past struggles with alcohol; Anthony's new, large house and his neighborhood's reaction; Opie's Manhattan apartment hunt; and their upcoming appearance on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*.  Extensive use of PalTalk allows listener interaction, with the hosts frequently addressing listener comments and complaints about mic cuts during breaks.  They extensively tease their new XM Radio commercial, which was apparently improvised on set and described as "stealing the show," with Jimmy being particularly praised for his performance.

A significant portion discusses Yoko Ono's chauffeur's attempted blackmail with compromising photos and tapes, leading to a playful, irreverent discussion of her singing voice and the Rolling Stones' "Rock and Roll Circus," including a listener's offensive comparison of her singing to the sounds of Hiroshima's destruction. This is followed by a MacBook Karaoke competition featuring listener submissions. One contestant, "Andrea the cake lady," wins a duet with Stephen Carr.  The hosts then play a listener-submitted clip of a woman's hilariously bad karaoke rendition of "I Saw the Sign," and another of a mentally challenged couple singing "Time of My Life."

The show delves into the Barack Obama presidential campaign, with repeated jokes about his middle name, "Hussein," and speculation about the impact of his race and name on his electability.  Further details regarding the Short Hills Mall event are provided for listeners interested in attending. Numerous calls follow regarding both the shopping spree and Obama.

The show includes an on-location segment in NYC, a "walk-over" for *Boston Magazine* sponsored by Natrol energy drink, featuring interactions with pedestrians and more unscripted banter. Back in the studio, they discuss their *Tonight Show* appearance, Golden Globe nominations, and share humorous anecdotes, including one about exploits in Bob Eatman's hotel room.  The broadcast ends with complaints about technical difficulties and self-deprecating remarks.

A major segment centers on Jimmy's on-air haircut, resulting in a horseshoe-shaped design.  The hosts discuss the style beforehand, solicit (unsuccessfully) listener suggestions, and joke throughout the prolonged haircut process.  They repeatedly play and enjoy a listener-submitted comedic song ("I Saw the Sign").  A lengthy, expletive-laden critique of the *Star Wars Holiday Special* follows, featuring audio clips and reactions to its various bizarre elements, including the Wookiee family, Bea Arthur, Art Carney, Jefferson Starship, and low production value.

A listener's call regarding a gift is briefly addressed.  There's extended discussion of comedian Rich Voss's attempts to get Jingle Ball tickets, using voicemails he left.  His self-promotion and perceived lack of self-awareness are discussed.  A brief, unrelated discussion about the first movie sequel follows.  Vulgar and offensive language is used extensively throughout these segments.

A segment focuses on the XM Satellite Radio commercial. Eric Logan from XM provides updates, including music clearance and national rollout (excluding Canada, with jokes at Canada's expense).  Playful banter ensues, with Eric mentioning hilarious outtakes.  One host mentions trying for a baby, and receives a large Christmas wreath and an e-card from Eric as a new viral marketing strategy.  XM billing issues and a host's concern about his girlfriend listening to past show replays (and fabricating a radio persona accordingly) are discussed. The segment concludes with further discussion of the commercial, the "homeless shopping spree," and the show's usual outro, including a humorous studio visitor guideline;  several off-color jokes, including one about a methadone clinic and offensive name-calling, are included.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony and James Norton.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a war fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Ovi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. 
[00:01:00]  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  AIDS.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Listen to this dramatic music.  Something unbelievable is about to happen, I guess.  Yeah, very important show. 
[00:02:00]  We're a bunch of asses.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  And the studio.  It's all back together today.  Thank God.  We kind of had a little accident yesterday.  Screwed it up.  We screwed it up for everybody.  This is we.  And then we walked out of the studio and we yelled, fix it! 
[00:02:30]  Have it fixed for tomorrow!  And guess what?  It's all fixed.  It seems to be.  All nice.  Very good.  Know what I'm going to do today just for a goof?  If you weren't listening yesterday, I knocked a whole bottle of water all over the fine board that is in front of me.  I said, no, you know.  What happened?  You just said, I don't know.  I knocked a bottle of water. 
[00:03:00]  No, you did.  Yeah, I did.  And then we proceeded to watch things turn off.  Slowly but surely.  It started with my mic.  Then Anthony's mic started crackling.  Electronics getting water in them.  Yeah.  It's a lot like a guy getting kicked in the groin.  You have to sit there for a few seconds and go, is everything going to be all right?  Hey, I think I might have skated this one.  I don't think, oh, no, there it is. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, there's the pain.  You breathe a sigh of relief.  Yeah.  Like you're back being, I don't know, a teenager, and you think you might be getting in trouble  with the parents, but then you think they didn't notice.  Yeah.  They're not going to call you out on it.  And then, oh, no.  And that's what happened yesterday.  The water spilt, and I grabbed a towel and dried it real quick.  And then everything was cool.  And then some of the lights started blinking, and the mics just got... 
[00:04:00]  You know the best part about that?  Before I acknowledged it to anybody, you're right.  I was dabbing it really fast, like, all right, no one will notice.  No one will know.  And I dried off the surface, but it's all these slots and stuff.  And all of a sudden, I just kind of watched the lights start just flickering a little,  flickering, a little flickering.  Flickering.  And then I watched some of the levels start going, whoa!  Whoa!  All over the place.  It was a disaster. 
[00:04:30]  And then the crackling, and then I finally had to admit to the head engineer here, Tim.  Ah, Tim, we got a problem.  We got a massive problem.  Spilt some water.  Tim had to fiddle with it.  Oh, he was fiddling for hours.  Just fiddling.  Blow dryer to dry out the electronics.  Stabbing it and blow drying it.  Yeah, it really was creepy.  Jimmy, the only reason I do your bit, because I love that bit, and you don't do it enough,  so I have to do it myself.  Once in a while, I have to.  Fiddle.  Just fiddling. 
[00:05:00]  It's fiddling.  He knew what he was doing.  With gizmos and gadgets, you fiddle with them.  Big hands trying to fit into the small area.  Tim's fat meat hooks.  And it's just hilarious to know that with all this ridiculous equipment, and we're broadcasting  in Canada and all over the country, all it takes is a hair dryer.  Right.  Just a hair dryer.  Just a hair dryer, dry it up, and back to normal.  But it looks like we're back to normal today.  Tim did a great job.  Yeah.  And I'm sure he's happy, because I'm sure he got some O.T., courtesy of the Opie and Anthony 
[00:05:30]  show yesterday.  Ah, good.  Hope he takes home a little extra cash for the holidays, because of your little mistake.  By the way, could you not open our presents ahead of time?  I kind of ruined it for you, didn't I?  Yeah.  Well, like we didn't know after 10 years of getting the same present from Caroline's.  See, hey, not that I'm complaining.  I got twin brothers in my family, and growing up, I used to think, God, that's just gotta  suck. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Because they're not individuals, even though they look completely different and they have  completely different personalities, but they always got the same gifts, and they were  always looked at as like a couple, a pair.  Yeah.  And I'm like, God, that sucks.  And then I start doing this radio show with Anthony, what, 12 years ago now?  Yeah.  And we're like twins.  Mm-hmm.  From time to time.  I can't tell you how many times I'm at an Islander game, or just wandering around Long  Island, and, hey, hey, Hope, where's that? 
[00:06:30]  I don't effing know.  What are we?  Connected at the hip.  He's in his mansion wearing the exact same thing as me right now.  Just picture it that way.  That's it.  We are twins.  We dress alike.  Hef pajamas.  That's what I wear.  Hef pajamas and those little feety things that they use when they're in a radiation room.  Keep it all nice and clean and sanitary.  So around the holiday, we get like two or three gifts from people we have helped all year 
[00:07:00]  long.  Yeah.  Mostly comedy clubs.  We sell a lot of tickets for comedians.  We sell a lot of tickets for comedians.  We show comedians for what they are, either good, funny guys, or hacks.  We sell tickets all over the country, by the way, not just for the clubs here in New York  City.  And, you know, two or three people acknowledge what we do for their business, and they send  a Christmas gift.  Yeah.  But they send the same exact thing.  So I had a nice wrap present on my desk today. 
[00:07:30]  I'm like, ooh.  I was feeling the excitement of the holiday season.  What could this be?  That's what I was thinking right away.  Yeah.  I sat down.  I'm like, I'm going to open up my present and make myself happy.  And then I look over to Anthony, and there's the gift unwrapped on his desk.  So I know what I'm getting right away.  Same exact shape as your present, only unwrapped.  So you know it's the same thing.  So with that, we've got to thank Caroline's here in New York City, right?  All the fine people at Caroline's on Broadway. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  They really are great.  What was it?  Some Dom?  Some Dom.  But a special version of Dom?  Really good, vintage, nice stuff.  Like a platinum edition.  I'd never heard of platinum Dom.  I know.  It was really, it is going to be really good, I'm sure.  Any Dom is good.  You know what I'm doing with my Dom?  Dumping it on the board.  What?  Oh my God, you got a great idea.  Go get me my Dom and a bunch of shot glasses.  The bubbles tickle my volume pots.  I'm going to play a little game.  I'm going to like pour 20 shots of Dom, and I'm just going to play. 
[00:08:30]  One a minute.  No, I'm not drinking.  Till the board pukes.  Oh, I don't drink.  I don't drink and do the radio show.  Till the board pukes.  You used to drink and do the radio show.  That's right, when we did afternoons.  What a pleasure that was.  I want to pour a bunch of shots of Dom and shot glasses and just place them all over  the board.  Oh, and then try to run the show with shot glasses of champagne all over the board.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll go over well.  No, I'm taking my Dom when I see old Jimmy Norton at the Bregada in Atlantic City. 
[00:09:00]  New Year's Eve.  Yes.  You pop a little of the bubbly at midnight.  Yes.  Kiss your best gal.  Yes.  That's what I'm doing with my Dom, Jimmy.  It's a nice place to have it, New Year's Eve.  That's good.  All right.  Hey.  I'll have mine tonight.  You celebrating Thursday?  Yeah, why not?  It'd be funny if you got into an argument in the audience and crashed your Dom into somebody's  face at the end of my show and got arrested.  Something tells me those bottles don't break too easy. 
[00:09:30]  It's very thick and heavy.  You can really smash someone's face with them.  I can't wait for that.  It's got to suck that the rest of the shows here at Free FM in New York City, they had  to do their, what, their shows from a little, like, closet?  Yeah.  The little studio?  Because of us.  Aw.  Sorry.  I was wondering why I went by the little studio and I see the JV and Elvis crew.  I'm like, why are there, like, nine people in that little room?  That doesn't look healthy.  That had to really suck.  I was wondering why they didn't just leave the studio set up the way it was until the shows 
[00:10:00]  were done and then come in and fix everything.  Yeah.  And then, you know, so they wouldn't have to be in a closet broadcasting.  No.  That's a pain in the ass.  All right.  Hey, speaking of alcohol, this is Ricky.  We got stuff to do today.  We're going to talk about Yoko.  We're going to talk about our brand new TV commercial that's going to be hitting the  airwaves very, very soon.  We got to talk about homeless shopping, the homeless shopping spree.  Homeless shopping spree already this Saturday.  Two days away.  What?  What time is it this Saturday? 
[00:10:30]  Two to six, I think we're doing.  Two to six.  Two to six, yeah.  Sleep in.  Yeah.  We'll sleep in and we'll, it gives the, whatever, we'll get into it.  We got a lot of details, new details for everybody.  We're going to announce the mall where we're going to today as well.  But speaking of alcohol, this just hit on the news, the local news, you know, New Year's  right around the corner, uh, yeah, they showed him bringing out the big crystal seven, uh,  for the 2007, uh, thing that, uh, hangs out up top of the, um, of Times Square when 
[00:11:00]  they dropped the big ball.  And they, of course, they have to talk about the crystal it's made out of and blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, how heavy it is.  So all the New Year's stories are starting.  And they just had a hangover story.  Yeah.  Because people like to drink on New Year's Eve, apparently.  And, uh, this, uh, this is, uh, 40 seconds.  That is a complete waste of time.  Yeah.  They're basically trying to get people to, to drink responsibly to, to avoid the hangover.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's not even so much a responsible drinking thing as how to avoid the hangover. 
[00:11:30]  They know you're going to be drinking a lot.  Right.  So, uh, here's the same set of rules that they've been giving you for years and years and years.  And then, you know, the news, it's a, it's a, it's a, just a boring morning for them about  what, two weeks before New Year's.  So, you know, it looks kind of nice when they, they lay out the plan for you.  Yeah.  But then New Year's comes along.  The music is at 11.  People are hammered all around you.  Shots are flying. 
[00:12:00]  And you're supposed to make some, some decisions.  You're supposed to go, you know, you know, I remember the news telling me.  A few weeks ago, I think I saw something about what to do to not be hungover.  First of all, I'm way past that point already.  What was I supposed to do?  Ah, screw it.  Give me another drink.  So here's the story.  This is just ridiculous.  This is a season four hangovers, but we can help you reduce the pain.  I would say drink in moderation.  But if you, you know, other than that, before you, before. 
[00:12:30]  Right there.  Yeah.  Drink in moderation.  Moderation.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's going to happen.  It's unless you're, you know, a recovering alcoholic or, uh, let me think designated driver  and you actually are responsible designated driver.  Um, you really don't drink in moderation on New Year's Eve.  No one drinks in moderation on New Year's.  I mean, it's, it's labeled the amateur night.  Yeah.  How many times have you heard New Year's Eve is amateur night?  And a lot of people will, uh, try to maybe have their own party at home or something because 
[00:13:00]  it is amateur night out there and it's a lot of, it's a lot of people that don't know  how to drink, uh, uh, drink and drive.  They don't know how to get completely, you know, hammered and, and still have some kind  of a personality.  Take those keys and put them right in the ignition.  Drive.  It's amateur.  Hammered.  Yep.  So to tell people to drink responsibly on New Year's Eve, that's a stop.  That's just not going to happen.  You know, other than that, before you, before you do that, you need to eat. 
[00:13:30]  This will regulate the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream.  Next, stick to light colored beverages, vodka, gin, white wine containing less additives.  Whites only.  What?  What's that?  That's a light color.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I think they have this, uh, misconception that, um, uh, liquor with coloring in it.  Uh, I don't know, maybe a dark rum, red wine, have more additives that give you a hangover,  but I've gotten just as, as big a hangover drinking vodka as I have a drinking, uh, Jack 
[00:14:00]  Daniels, uh, and, and at the same time and, uh, mixed with anything else.  But once again, you're at a New Year's Eve party and someone's like, uh, walking around  with JÃ¤germeister shots and you're going to make that split decision.  And she told me to drink clear alcohol.  So I'm going to pass on this one.  Yeah.  JÃ¤ger is about the most, that's the darkest drink you can drink.  But I'm just saying, you're not going to make these decisions on the spot just because 
[00:14:30]  some dumb news lady had 40 seconds to kill on our morning, uh, news program.  Hey dummy, what's your stance on Jell-O shots?  Yeah.  That's what I want to know.  Because when those Jell-O shots come out.  Exactly.  Oof.  My most awful New Year's Eve ever where I wound up in the hospital was vodka.  It was vodka induced.  You went to the hospital on New Year's Eve.  Oh, did I?  Oh, did I?  Yeah.  How old were you?  Do you have one story where you were drinking and something even remotely awful didn't happen? 
[00:15:00]  No.  You don't have one story where you drank, had a good time, went to sleep, woke up, and  there wasn't some felony committed, or you weren't in the hospital, or you didn't hurt  someone or yourself.  The first time I ever drank at all, ever drank, it was me and my friends, and I went into this  shop right.  And I was shaking my friend's hand, but he didn't shake my hand the way I liked.  So an hour later, I was crying outside holding a box cutter, and they had to stop me from  going inside and cutting them. 
[00:15:30]  I was in a partial blackout.  And then I slept in a tent and threw up bread balls.  That was your first time drinking.  First drunk, yeah.  Hey, congrats.  First time drinking, I danced a little.  That was nice.  When you were 17.  That's nice.  No, I was actually much younger.  No, I was just saying, though, because I've been keeping track of my brain here over the  years, and it sounds like your 17th year on this earth was just a doozy.  Wow.  Just a doozy.  That was a lot of naughtiness.  Wow.  Because by 18, you were done, right?  Or did you make it into 18 drinking? 
[00:16:00]  A little bit into 18.  Well, mostly 17, if I'm keeping track of it correctly.  Half of 18.  Half of 18.  A little 18, too.  It's February, my birthday, July.  So from July of 18th to February of 18th.  It amazes me that you could just use up all of your drinking privileges before you make  it through 18.  I've never taken a legal drink in my life.  I was three years clean and sober before I could have ever had a drink in a bar.  Legally?  I was three years sober before I did stand-up, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  It just amazes me.  I used them all up.  You used them all up.  Used them all up.  Yeah, for the new listeners, yeah, Jimmy hasn't drugged or had a drink since he was 18.  No, he realized, which is odd, too, because a lot of times at that age, you're not going  to realize that, okay, this is a problem, unless I do something about it.  I would have had no clue, because all the people I was getting hammered with when I was  They were just like Jimmy.  Yeah.  It was called being 18 and being hammered.  Yeah.  It wasn't, you know, a special problem or, you know, issues or, or the, it was just that 
[00:17:00]  age and being drunk made you an idiot.  Yeah.  But you, you realized there was just a little something special about you.  I went beyond what an idiot should be.  Yeah.  I went beyond what an idiot should be.  Yeah.  I went beyond the FBI, bomb, just nonsense.  Bomb threats and calling the FBI.  I called the FBI one, and I called the police in a Jamaican accent one night, and I told them  to come get me and put me in jail.  I was in a Jamaican accent.  I was calling the FBI.  I have no idea why.  Why?  I have no idea why.  Because you're silly.  It was an ass.  And I walked out of jail, and I told them to put me in jail. 
[00:17:30]  So they did for the night, and then I wanted to go home, and they wouldn't let me.  I was just a dude.  You wanted to go home.  They can't put you in jail, and then let you go home, and you asked.  I didn't know.  What was I, a lawyer?  You got drunk.  I was just a sweaty boy in a Kangol hat.  Faggoty wigger.  That rocks.  I just love that you used up every drinking privilege you had.  Right now, you take the old drinking privilege cup, and it's like a fishbowl, and there's  nothing coming out.  All used up, are they? 
[00:18:00]  Dry as a whistle.  Oh, that's something.  Couple less.  The Uzi was a doozy.  Good gin.  White wine contained less additives that contribute to a hangover.  Drink a glass of water or juice between each alcoholic beverage and before going to bed.  And in the morning, you use bitters to make an anti-hangover tea.  What do you get, bitters?  Or just as I said, drink in moderation.  How about that?  Yeah.  So much easier, isn't it?  You don't have to take notes. 
[00:18:30]  How about have a glass of juice?  Who's doing that on New Year's Eve?  That's what I'm saying.  Use me some juice.  This sounds all right on a Thursday morning a couple weeks before New Year's, but when  you get to New Year's, you're not thinking about anything except getting completely hammered.  Could I have some juice in between my two?  Drink, faggot!  Oh, okay.  See, I was watching Lucy Nolan, and she told me to drink water and juice in between drinks,  so do you have any orange juice in the fridge for me?  Or some water.  Or water.  Perhaps some cranapple. 
[00:19:00]  Can I have a tall glass of cold water?  You know what you do on New Year's Eve?  The second you start drinking, you just keep drinking.  And drinking.  You don't stop and drink water or juice.  You keep drinking.  If there's a choice, if you've had a couple of beers, and now there's a choice, another icy  cold beer or a glass of water, you're grabbing the beer because it's New Year's Eve and you've 
[00:19:30]  already had a few.  Yeah.  You're not thinking, like, responsibly.  No.  If you were, you wouldn't have had the first beer, probably.  Right, absolutely.  All right, listen, we've got to step aside.  When we get back, let's get into Yoko.  Yoko is on the front page of the New York Post.  Tapes things.  Chauffeur's slay threat.  Threatened to kill Yoko.  Wanted $2 million.  And the first thing we thought when we saw this front page, we said, Kenny's going to do  the exact same thing to us someday. 
[00:20:00]  You know it's coming.  For a lot less money, though.  I need $75.  And you get to see Brad and Angelina's baby on the front page of the New York Post today.  Could tell it's a slow news day when they throw that on the cover.  Oh, absolutely.  But we're going to have a great show, so.  Look at that.  Whoa.  No.  Oh, boy.  Don't spill any beverage.  You need a sippy cup. 
[00:20:30]  You need one of those little kids' sippy cups that don't spill.  And he's not drinking.  Yeah, it's like one of the ones you can close the lid over so that none of your juice can spill.  It's us.  Thanks for listening to us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We'll see what you guys are talking about today in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:22:00]  What's up with Pal Talk?  Well, they were mad because the microphones were off during that break.  We leave them on during 99% of the breaks that we take during commercials.  You know, we sit around here and BS and stuff about everything.  And we were talking about, like, Christmas presents and stuff.  For our chicks and stuff.  And we know what loud mouths you are.  And you can't keep your noses out of everyone's business. 
[00:22:30]  So, uh, why don't we turn the mics off while we discuss Christmas presents?  They're beeswax minders.  Yeah.  Mind your own.  So they were all bitching secrets.  Ooh, they're telling secrets.  Why?  No sound.  There's no sound.  Panic guy.  You get, like, panic guy.  Something's broke.  There's no sound.  Nosey guy.  What do you think they're talking about?  Over and over again.  You know, if I was a fan of this show, and, uh, I'm not, I would think the PalTalk thing 
[00:23:00]  would be really, really cool, though.  Behind-the-scenes stuff like that.  Kind of doing our own reality thing.  Yep.  We invented reality.  Hoo-hoo.  Apparently, we are getting credit for inventing the use of PalTalk on radio.  That's right.  There's an article.  I think it's coming out in FMQB, one of the trade publications.  Oh, right.  They did an interview with one of the head guys from PalTalk.  Uh-huh.  And we are prominently, um, in, in this article, they really, uh, uh, talk about us and how 
[00:23:30]  we use it to interact with the audience and everything.  And, uh, he does mention that we are, like, the first show that really brought this on  board as an interaction with the audience both ways.  They watch us.  We watch them.  Uh, they interact with us.  And how, how is Howard going to spin this one?  Somehow he's going to say that, no, he invented this.  I invented it.  I called it buddy chat at the time.  Ass.  He is an ass.  Yeah, we love the PalTalk cameras.  They're all over the place.  We've got two in studio.  And then I think we've got a, um, a camera that's just at XM so we can keep an eye on 
[00:24:00]  the guys over there.  So we can watch Steve.  Yeah, it's Steve Cam, the Biff, Fuzzy Bear Cam.  It's Steve Cam.  Watch him get shot with a tranquilizer dart and then put a tag in his ear.  Yeah, because I'm trying to get everyone up to speed.  For the new listeners, we do, uh, two different shows every day.  We do one for, uh, you know, regular radio or terrestrial radio and then we go over to  XM.  So there's a staff over at XM getting ready, uh, for that part of the show.  So we get to take, take a look at them and make sure they're, they're earning their keep. 
[00:24:30]  I like the idea of what Anthony will go away and hook up a camera.  I don't know.  That's a PalTalk.  Oh yeah, it, it actually is.  It's one of the PalTalk cameras, but I could access it anywhere, anytime I want.  Oh, I should do that and catch my girlfriend doing things.  Oh, catch her snooping.  I'll bet you she snoops, but I don't know if she's a snooper.  I'll bet you she does passive aggressive things.  Like she probably takes my toothbrush and does things that you only thought were myths and  then puts it back for me to brush my teeth with.  And then silently giggles. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Every time I brush my teeth and I wonder what I ate again.  Yeah.  When I go away, I could just like pop it on and take a look at the, at the house.  Cause you know, you got the camera that can move remote control.  So you pan around, I pan around, make sure, you know, everything's there.  Although if somebody broke in and stole stuff from the house, they would obviously take the  computer.  So I would know by not being able to even log in that something is amiss. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Well, you'd log in just in time and you'd hear, like when your camera looked up, all you'd  see is a face and three gold teeth.  And then blank screen as the plug got yanked.  By the way, can we talk about something here?  Yes.  How big is your effing house?  Why?  I saw a picture of your house decorated.  How big is that wreath?  How did you see that?  It was sent to my girlfriend.  Oh, right.  My girlfriend sent out pictures of, oh, you saw the front of the house with the big wreath? 
[00:26:00]  Your girlfriend is sending out pictures to rub it into everybody.  No, she's very excited that we finally decorated for Christmas.  Jimmy, he's got a wreath on his house.  It might as well be hanging from Rockefeller Center.  It's about nine feet across.  Are they getting next year's Christmas tree from your yard?  When those little Mexicans took it out of the truck, I started laughing.  How, how, how, how, what?  It's, it's like nine feet across.  Nine feet across.  It's ridiculous.  It's from, it's from a take that Jews.com. 
[00:26:30]  There is but one lonely house in the neighborhood besides ours that has Christmas lights on it at night.  I see it out the bathroom window at night.  And that's, that's it.  All the rest.  I mean, the neighborhood is just not a light on the house.  In a couple of days, I would gather there will be some lights coming on in some of the picture windows of some of the houses.  Menorahs will probably be in a lot of the windows. 
[00:27:00]  But don't get me wrong.  I love living amongst the Jews.  It's a wonderful way of life.  Wonderful neighborhood.  It's clean.  It's, uh, crime-free.  And wonderfully manicured lawns.  I love the Jews.  But, uh, I want to know.  I'm a little bothered.  I didn't get a Christmas card that, oh, God.  Why wasn't I sending a Christmas card?  You didn't get the, um, little online, uh.  Oh, it was online.  It was sent to, like, four people.  But, but, Jimmy didn't get.  Maybe I didn't, didn't check the email.  I have to.  I have to check that before. 
[00:27:30]  You know what?  Making accusations and getting hurt feelings.  You know what, Jimmy?  Don't even look at it.  You'll just get depressed.  I want to blow it up as a goal.  That's a goal of mine, to get a house like that.  And he didn't even decorate his own house.  No, I hired Mexicans.  I didn't even know you could call a company.  I didn't either.  And they just come over and decorate your house for you.  Dude, I am finding out that there are people to call for everything.  Yeah, well, I do nothing anymore.  Anthony does with his money what everyone wants to do with their money, which is fetch that boy and fetch me that boy. 
[00:28:00]  I've just reached a point in my life where I've done enough.  I worked for a living for many years, and I had it.  And I moved my own furniture like everybody else does many times when I got thrown out of my apartments for not paying the rent because it was much more important to buy radio control airplanes at the time.  And to get everyone up to speed again, we're reintroducing a lot of people to this show.  Anthony did live in his car for a while.  Yeah, and there was a time I was actually homeless. 
[00:28:30]  I had to live in my Monza, my 1979 Monza.  And now he has a nine-foot wreath in front of his palace.  Palace to F.  He really does have a big â€“ I haven't seen it yet.  I'm sure we'll be invited over soon.  Well, holidays.  Big holiday party?  Well, the interior is still being worked on.  I am not furnished yet.  It takes so long to furnish a house.  It really does.  I swear to you, it really takes a long time.  I got a guy now. 
[00:29:00]  He's working on the office.  Yeah.  And the great room is being worked on.  Dude, please.  They're saying this on Pal Talk.  Please send that picture to your ex.  Ah, there you go.  What do you think?  I want her to know where I live.  All I want to do is go to your new house.  I know it still has a new house smell.  Yes.  And I want to drink a lot of half and half.  And then gas in that stupid office of yours, that brand new oak office.  I want to go in and go.  It's mahogany, my friend. 
[00:29:30]  Exactly.  I will wreck that mahogany vibe immediately.  A little warp.  That's from the smell of Jim.  One cup of coffee with some good half and half.  Goodbye mahogany smell.  Can we come over and just broadcast to the neighborhood?  No.  Just blasting Christmas music.  And then we'll just get on the microphone and just openly mock your neighbors for having boring decorations.  I've already heard that.  I hear tell they're already not happy with me.  Really? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, it's just the thing.  There's like chitter chatter.  Are you kidding?  They're relieved that you're not Muslim.  Well, that's true too.  But I think I'm second place to a Muslim living there.  I heard some chitter chatter that some of the neighbors are not happy that a radio guy is living in the neighborhood.  No, a lot of neighbors are not happy that you, Anthony of the Opie Anthony Show, live in the neighborhood.  Okay.  If you were Rush Limbaugh, they'd think it was fun.  Hey, Rush, how's the president?  Oh, cut it out. 
[00:30:30]  I'm going to work.  No, that's just not a radio guy.  It's, oh, do you mean the people that had sex in the church?  That's what they look at you as.  Not the fun radio guy.  Okay, you make a good point, Jimmy.  Good point indeed.  Not the battle of the sexes radio guy.  Yeah, no.  It's all fun for everybody and no one gets hurt.  Yeah, you're playing silly Christmas songs.  Radio guy that has fun banter with the hole in the studio and she goes, oh, gosh.  You're the guy that does Hitler jokes.  These are all plastic surgeons and doctors and responsible people. 
[00:31:00]  Right, yeah.  They want fun neighbors, not garbage.  They want fun radio guy.  Not the guy that throws girls pretty much naked in 55-gallon drums and then dumps all sorts of stuff on them  until they scream bloody murder and they want out.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  They want the Scott and Todd type radio guy.  I've seen them take their walks through the neighborhood and actually point at the house.  I don't know what they're saying.  I don't know what they're saying, but they point. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, they're planning a coup.  Accusingly.  They're planning a coup, yeah.  Let them try.  Good luck.  Do you know how much you have to look out the window suspiciously to catch people silently pointing at your home?  Yeah.  Do you know how many hours he has spent at windows just peeking?  I've peered.  I bet you at home Anthony puts on like the black makeup under the eyes to keep the sun from bouncing.  We have what we call busy bodies in the neighborhood and just people that drive around.  They stop in front of the house and take pictures of it.  There are people that take pictures of it and that annoys me. 
[00:32:00]  Are they fans?  I don't know what they are, but they just drive by in their cars and stop and take little photographs.  I stand in the window and look at them and I watch them drive by.  I go, what are you taking a picture of?  It gets me angry, but I do peer out my windows a lot.  I know you do.  Upstairs.  Look out the turret window.  I have a turret.  I'm going to install some guns in it.  Like I said yesterday, I have my haters out there. 
[00:32:30]  Some dude on his cell phone just trying to get to me every morning.  Opie, you make the same as Anthony, so stop with the Ant's house is so big, blah, blah, blah bit.  It's old.  You can afford it too.  I can't find anything in New York City that I like.  Are you still looking?  Yeah, I'm looking.  I'm looking twice a week.  I looked at some dead guy's apartment the other day.  It's a little.  Is he still there?  Huh?  He might as well have been.  The smell made it seem like he might still be there.  He was sitting there with his legs crossed, pointing in a gentlemanly fashion at the art on the wall. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Look.  It took me, by the way, to that guy, it took me a year and a half to find the house I wanted.  A year and a half.  I'm not trying to make anyone think that Anthony makes a lot more money than me.  Trust me.  Oh, millions.  But the reality is I can't find anything in Manhattan.  You can't find a nice place to live in Manhattan.  Very hard.  And let me interject.  It's really hard.  That I am trying to make it, that Anthony makes a lot more money than me.  Well, well.  To that listener.  But it took me a while to.  It's hard.  It's hard to find a place you want to live, man. 
[00:33:30]  You want to buy a place.  And the reality is there's people driving by Anthony's house, taking pictures and stuff,  because he just has a lovely house at this point.  Oh, thank you.  Well, I've heard.  I mean, I've only seen it in pictures.  And I got.  Feel free to stop by.  And I got homeless guys sleeping right outside my door.  That is a fact.  So it's a little different right now.  Okay.  Maybe eventually, just like getting a nice bottle of Dom where we have equal gifts.  Maybe we'll have equal residence.  But at this point, the reality is I live in an asshole. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  He's had people over.  I hope he's had people over.  I'll say that.  I've never had anybody.  I'll have you guys all over as individuals.  As a group, you can die in the lobby, because there's none of you coming up as five.  You don't want a big bunch of animals in your house.  Absolutely not.  You have dirty shoes all over.  Yeah.  You're tracking dog logs all over the place.  I certainly don't.  Nice, clean feet.  All of us have our criteria for the perfect place.  And it's all different.  Jimmy wound up getting the place he wanted.  Jimmy got the place that he wanted slash that he could afford.  I want to move up eventually. 
[00:34:30]  Well, yes, that's true.  Jimmy.  But it's a nice building, and you like it.  Love it.  Your place is nicer than just about every place I've seen in the last eight months.  Really?  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable, the crap holes that I've seen.  For the money I'm willing to spend, just bathrooms that just have mold.  See, you want to live in Manhattan.  And the wallpaper is peeling off the walls.  They didn't even bother to, like, make the place halfway decent.  Smells that I can't even describe.  I had to deal with a commute because I wanted to live on Long Island, but I didn't want to live far out on Long Island because the commute really sucks. 
[00:35:00]  But you get a lot more for your money the further east on Long Island you go.  So you've got to kind of compromise and say, all right, I'll move in a little closer to Manhattan, but maybe I won't have as much property or something.  So there's all these compromises you have to make.  One, if you want to live in Manhattan, you're not going to get as much room for as much money as you would in the suburbs.  Or in Brooklyn, you could buy a brownstone or a brownstone. 
[00:35:30]  But in Brooklyn.  Yeah, at that point, I'd rather have a commute.  You know, the reality.  What I want is, you know, an easy commute.  I want to be, what, $14, $15.  So all this costs you money.  Yeah.  In some way or another, it translates to a dollar figure.  You don't want to commute, it's going to cost you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So far, no luck for me.  Why don't you just move in with me?  We'll have, like, you and your chick.  And my chick's there a lot, but looking forward, it's like a sleepover.  That'd be cute.  Yeah.  Sleeping bags. 
[00:36:00]  You could pull out a cot.  Yeah, girls could talk on the couch all night.  You know.  Now, I'm only saying because we've got to chain you to your bed.  Well, you know what?  That may be happening sooner or later.  The way things are going with us.  Things are moving into some fun directions.  Teehee.  Oh, no.  It's just always a crapshoot with you.  I couldn't believe I liked it slapped.  I don't know why.  I've never had it slapped.  Not hard.  Just.  I couldn't believe I liked it slapped. 
[00:36:30]  Jimmy found a keeper.  Cooper, you are really, really not too far off from just completely falling off the edge  and getting into some really weird stuff.  Well, way to look at it.  I think right now I'm looking up at the edge, hanging on by my teeth.  He's looking for a wedding hall because I think he's truly in love.  He found the one.  You know, it's all leading up to certain things.  Like, she meets this criteria and that criteria.  Yeah.  Now, it's like, let's just see how you like this special belt that I have with the little 
[00:37:00]  thing on the front of it.  Teach me a lesson.  That's right.  Could you put on this salt and pepper man's wig and call me Sonny?  I'll explain later.  I want to come over to your house Christmas morning, man.  We're getting a tree.  For the unwrapping of the gifts.  I got a tree.  I'm getting a tree.  No stand, so it's kind of just leaning against a wall right now.  Yeah.  Just the worst.  No stand?  Anthony doesn't either.  He actually hired two Mexicans to hold it.  Just hold it.  And they stand there very still. 
[00:37:30]  But you give them water every once in a while, right?  Yeah.  I did the PalTalk chat the other day.  Remember that?  Yeah.  They went to version 9.0, so they had a little celebrity chat thing.  And I was invited to participate.  And I did it as a fireside chat.  So it was the first time I used my fireplace, and PalTalk people were saying, bringing up  Opie's little Java log incident and telling me to make sure I have the flu open because  they don't want the fire department to come over. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, I've had some terrific stories.  With your fireplace smoking out your apartment.  Oh, it's giving me some great fodder for this radio show.  I'm just a sweet boy.  I'm just a waste when it comes to trying to figure out stuff in my personal life as far  as how to live right.  I stink.  I think it's fear-based.  That's my opinion.  Like, deep down, you're afraid of something.  Like, doing certain things is like an acknowledgement of being an adult.  It's an acknowledgement, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't ever want to grow up. 
[00:38:30]  That's true.  Now that I'm pushing 30, I'm getting a little scared.  Yeah, a little scared.  Once you leave college like that.  All right.  When you leave college.  They're looking at me like, who is this young boy?  You know what it is when you're what they call liquid.  You know, when you're liquid.  You don't have many responsibilities, and it's a very youthful way of life.  You just go, you grab some money, you do whatever you want. 
[00:39:00]  Once you start buying major things like houses, that's a responsibility, and it's a commitment.  It's things like that that I think you probably aren't as easy with.  No, I mean, maybe five years ago, I'm more than ready.  I'm more than ready.  Yeah, now.  It's so frustrating that I can't find what I want.  But to actually make the leap into purchasing something like that, like a house, is a big thing for somebody.  And you do, like, get nervous, and it keeps you kind of on your toes after you do it. 
[00:39:30]  You realize, I can't just, you know, I can't just grab up and leave or, you know, do whatever the hell I want.  You've got certain responsibilities.  No, I'm more than excited.  I mean, you guys know, I actually was going to buy Stone Phillips' place.  Yes.  And then the co-op board got a hold of me and said, eh-eh, we don't want him in our building.  Stone Phillips.  And that place continues to just sit there.  So something's going on with that.  Does poor Stone just have to eat it? 
[00:40:00]  The co-op board, there's something going on with the building.  You just got to sit there and not get money.  It's the Oliver Cromwell building, and they got it out for Stone Phillips because that place is gorgeous, and no one else is buying it.  And I've heard rumors that Stone Phillips might have maybe made some updates on the apartment without talking to the board, and now they're so pissed off they're going to make that place sit there for a while.  It's been sitting there for over a year, and the place is unbelievable.  It's within their power to deny anybody that makes him an offer. 
[00:40:30]  So they, in fact, have power over him never selling his place.  Right.  And the price has dropped drastically in the last, well, at this point, it's probably a year and a half.  It's like, oh, why didn't you let me sell my place to this guy?  Oh, don't even have to tell you.  There doesn't have to be a reason.  Oh, he must want to bash that.  Dude.  Oh.  Dude, I put down a down payment, 10%.  I did everything.  He should fix it like Dr. Boom did.  Remember him? 
[00:41:00]  Dr. Boom.  Good old Dr. Boom.  When he blew up his apartment building.  Good old Dr. Boom.  Dr. Boom.  All right, listen.  Why don't you call Trump?  You know Donald Trump.  Tell him to hook you up.  The Trumpster.  Yeah.  I looked at a place in one of his buildings.  It was all right.  It was all right.  It was all right.  It was one of the older buildings, though.  Talk about new construction.  It was all right.  This is what I want, and this is what I'd like.  Please.  That's what you get.  New construction.  Although, Ope, you raised a good point about when someone builds something and you buy it, 
[00:41:30]  you're paying for new construction, and three or four, however many years from now,  the value goes down.  You can't sell it for the same thing because it's not new anymore.  It's not new.  Well, I don't know for sure, but that's my theory on the whole thing because I'm also looking at new construction  and the prices for new construction is like almost twice the price for the same type of apartment that's a bit older.  Technically, you're not supposed to lose money, though.  That's what they say.  Technically, you don't lose money.  New construction.  Who knows?  It doesn't matter.  If it's old construction and you buy it, it's not going to get newer as time goes on. 
[00:42:00]  It, too, will age.  But you're not spending more just because of when it was built.  You're spending a lot more.  And if I sold my place right now, I would lose money because the real estate market has dropped.  Wow, this is fun for people to listen to.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, why not?  It was fun.  It was fun.  I was talking about real estate prices.  Come back in a few minutes after the break.  We'll be discussing interest rates.  It was fun until two minutes ago, but at least we'll acknowledge that.  That's true.  So we're going to regroup.  Three Zs.  Hey, we got a brand new TV commercial that just got done. 
[00:42:30]  And we want to do something different with this TV commercial.  It's going to be on TV, but we want to, like, debut it on the net.  Yeah.  On, like, one of the big websites.  So Steve's working on it right now.  We'll see.  Soundry music.  Well, we'll get into the details next.  And we've got to talk about the homeless shopping spree.  We've got to talk about Yoko.  We have to talk about Obama.  What is about Obama?  Well, they're finally acknowledging that his name could be a problem.  Of course it is.  And do you even know what his middle name is? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll tell the people next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus. 
[00:43:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Want to say good morning to Philly.  What's up, Philly?  Big hi to everybody listening to us on WYSP.  They're excited for the homeless shopping spree down there in Philadelphia.  Yes.  You'll be hearing it live.  Yeah.  It's a little different this year.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree this Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m. here in New York City.  And we gave all the stations we're on the option to carry that show live. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I think we're on about 25 radio stations right now.  Something like that.  Also being heard all over XM and XM Canada.  And Philly was the only city that said, yeah, we will take the homeless shopping spree live.  The only city.  The other ones have their weekend programming.  Their weekend programming they can't shuffle.  Very surprised at Boston.  Very surprised they decided not to air our homeless shopping spree live. 
[00:44:30]  What are they doing over there on Saturday afternoon?  Maybe we should ask, like, our pest, what is the local station doing on Saturday instead of running our homeless shopping spree?  That's a good idea.  What is more important than the homeless shopping spree?  Or more interesting.  Yeah, maybe it is more interesting.  Yeah.  All right.  If it's just a rock block.  I doubt it, because when you talk about original radio, this is something that just hasn't been done before.  No one comes close to doing this type of broadcast. 
[00:45:00]  Every year, I think this is the fourth one, maybe?  What are we up to, Iraq?  Yeah, this is the homeless shopping spree, the fourth time we've done it.  We've been interviewing the homeless for the last, what, four or five months.  Actually, for the whole year, more or less.  We're keeping our eyes, you know, peeled back.  Peeled, ow.  And we're taking a look around us, and we pick the best homeless people every year.  And then we get them on a bus.  We get them liquored up, because they love their liquor. 
[00:45:30]  Only the cream of the crop.  They love their liquor, and we make sure they're all liquored up before they get to the mall.  Yeah, we let them indulge.  And when they get to the mall, they are met by a minimum of 1,000 to 2,000 of our listeners.  Listeners that want to shop with them.  And at that point, they all enter the mall at the same time, and the chanting begins, and the shopping begins, and everyone starts feeling very good about themselves. 
[00:46:00]  And they go into stores and try on clothes and shoes, which all the stores just love.  On our dime, we give the homeless a nice bit of money to spend.  A chunk of change, and the listeners chip in.  Well, that's where it gets really good, because the listeners, it's amazing every year how much the listeners actually spend on the homeless.  Oh, they get so sucked up in that spirit of giving.  And some of the homeless, you know, they take their money, and they just find a bar and say, you know what, I'm just drinking the afternoon away at a really nice, warm bar. 
[00:46:30]  They'll just go to, you know how all the malls have restaurants in there, and some of the restaurants have full bars?  They'll go in and just sit at the bar, and to them, it's like paradise.  To sit at a bar like a real human being, and drink and get drunk.  And not be spat upon.  Right.  They're told to get out.  You can't use the bathroom.  And because they're paying customers, they're allowed to use the bathroom.  So they go in there and pretty much take a bird bath in the sink.  They're showering in the bar's bathrooms. 
[00:47:00]  A Ruby Foose bathroom to a homeless guy.  It's like a Waldorf to the rest of us.  Yeah.  They are so, they'll sneak into like gas station bathrooms and clean up.  Yeah.  And take those horrid showers with that filthy gas station soap.  Yep.  It's filthy because of them.  It's got all the grease on it.  Yeah.  This is like living the high life.  They don't scrub off in the toilet.  They don't care.  They don't understand who the guy is that's in there handing out the paper towels.  And why there's a basket of money.  We have a hell of a crew this year.  A hell of a crew. 
[00:47:30]  And just some crazy stuff ends up happening.  You know, they end up trying on brand new sneakers.  They haven't taken their socks off in two years.  But they're going to try on new sneakers and sometimes new suits.  It's just unbelievable.  And the listeners really have a lot of fun just going to the mall and checking it out for themselves.  Right.  Well, here's the deal.  We're doing it Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m.  So we're working Saturday this year.  2 to 6 p.m.  It will be live here in New York City on Free FM.  And in Philly. 
[00:48:00]  And in Philly on WYSP.  Matter of fact, WYSP, they're getting their own homeless guy.  Yeah.  And they have a guest homeless person.  From Philly.  They're driving up a homeless guy from Philly.  YSP really, really into this show.  Really into this homeless shopping spree.  You know, we should have studied homeless people a little more.  I hope that they don't work like a tropical fish where you put one in and they don't go along with the other ones and the other ones attack it.  Yeah.  Because we don't know how New York homeless people are going to treat a Philly homeless guy. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  There might be some violence.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Oh, they know that.  What do they think?  They introduce each other and go, hey, where don't you live?  Oh, they know.  Where don't you live?  For some reason, these guys know.  They know each other very well.  Yeah.  And just some of the audio we get.  A quick sniff to the back of their pants is what it is.  You're from Philly.  She's thick.  I knew it.  Just some of the audio we get just on the bus ride to the mall is priceless.  Yeah.  You get one guy that is convinced we're taking them to jail. 
[00:49:00]  He just starts screaming.  Thinks it's a scam.  Yeah.  They finally, it sinks in that they're on a bus going somewhere and they think it's got to be some kind of scam where they're going to jail.  Yeah.  It was a set up all along.  Other guys are happy, fun, and festive singing holiday songs at the beginning and then at the end, after a few beverages, they're the belligerent, nasty drunk.  Yeah.  One of my favorite memories is, yeah, the guy's screaming his head off and in the back of the bus, they're singing like jingle bells.  So you hear like Christmas caroling and the rantings of a lunatic. 
[00:49:30]  It takes like literally like an hour just to get them on the bus.  It's just a mess.  They're not very organized, the homeless.  Trust me, it will be one of the best O.B. and Anthony shows you hear this year.  Well, the year is almost up, but you know what I'm saying.  It really is great every year.  It's a benchmark.  So once again, if you're listening to us on Free FM here in New York City, 2 to 6 p.m. this Saturday, we will be live doing the homeless shopping spree.  WISP picking up the show.  Now I'm getting word that Boston might be doing it. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  We're just not sure yet.  They're trying to get the hookup for them.  But here's the deal, because now we've got a lot of people on the phones going, this is BS.  I want to hear this show.  They will rebroadcast it on Monday.  It will be rebroadcast in its entirety on Monday.  On Monday.  On all of the stations.  On all the stations you're hearing us on right now, yes.  And of course, it's going to be heard live on XM as well.  Right.  Of course.  Okay.  And Carl in New Jersey has something for the homeless shopping spree.  Carl, what's up? 
[00:50:30]  Hello.  Hey, Carl.  What's going on?  Good morning.  It's Doyle.  Doyle?  Doyle.  Hi, Doyle.  What's up, Doyle?  Doyle.  I ain't doing it.  Doyle.  Hey, I sure wish you guys would have thought about it a little deeper and came out to Short Hills.  That's like the third most prestigious mall in America.  Oh, really?  I would have had a blast watching all those rich people freak out on you guys.  Ladies and gentlemen, this year's homeless shopping spree will be at Short Hills Mall in New Jersey. 
[00:51:00]  That would be fantastic.  We're going back to Short Hills Mall.  Make sure you spread the word.  Anyway, thanks, fellas.  Good morning.  Yeah, this is one of the snootiest malls in the New York area.  We did it there one other time.  We're going back to Short Hills Mall in New Jersey this Saturday from 2 to 6.  You got a special invite from Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton to join us for the homeless shopping spree.  Tell your friends.  It's a very high-end mall.  I would like to go on to the mall itself, actually, but I can't say.  There's nothing to do after. 
[00:51:30]  I know.  It would be fun.  I would love to do that.  To actually go along and watch.  Dirty bums.  Well, here we go.  It's coming in.  Jamie from West Palm Beach, Florida.  Jamie, what's up?  Yeah, I was just saying, I'm down from near West Palm, and they don't do anything on Saturdays.  They have something called the 90s at 9.  It's the same old rock music all the time.  Oh, okay.  Well, no, I can understand being that.  Well, we wouldn't exactly expect West Palm to do that for the show anyway, to be honest.  Yeah, well.  We're very surprised at the lack of stations coming forward to pick up this show live on Saturday. 
[00:52:00]  Very surprised.  Or are we?  No, not at all.  I'm not.  No.  You know, to actually do something a little different.  Oh, my God.  Shake it up a little.  Shake it up a little.  But no.  This is not what we're used to.  When we go to tune in music and go, what the?  What the?  Who the?  I can't.  I might drive into a tree.  We're not used to this.  What's going to happen to the block party week? 
[00:52:30]  And they'll realize people, you know, there's people will tune in and hear something different  and then just never go back to the station.  That's what regular people listen to.  Yeah.  They never go back.  I'm sure they've done studies.  I'm sure they have.  And it's research.  Is this true?  I don't remember this.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I remember the first homeless shopping spree started because Anthony got snubbed at the  Short Hill Mall.  One of the people in a couple of the stores treated him like crap because he wasn't dressed 
[00:53:00]  appropriately.  So for revenge, you guys brought a whole bus full of homeless people to Short Hills Mall.  I love how urban legends get started.  Where the hell did that one come from?  Sir, can I tell you something?  I have never been to the Short Hills Mall in my life.  Oh, boy.  Never.  Uh-oh.  So I've heard some false information.  Yes.  That is an urban legend now.  Look at us.  All right.  We're part of urban myth.  Yeah.  And, of course, the snobs called the mall at Short Hills. 
[00:53:30]  Ah.  Not the Short Hills Mall.  Ah.  It is the mall at Short Hills.  All right.  For the O&A Pass, it's time to spread the word.  This Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m., we will be at the Short Hills Mall doing our homeless  shopping spree.  It will be live on the radio here in New York City on Free FM.  Right.  Saturday, 2 to 6.  It will be live in Philly on WISP from 2 to 6 p.m.  And for all the other stations that don't pick it up, it will rebroadcast on Monday at  your regular time when you get to hear the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  And I think I got to call Matt and Huggy today at WISP.  Yeah.  Because they're all excited and they're helping us out and getting that homeless person.  How did they find him?  I don't know.  Who is he?  Do we have a background on him at all?  Well, maybe someone from WISP could give us a call and tell us how they're finding their  homeless person.  I'd like to know about this because it's taken us years to call the best of the best.  We're very picky.  We have an all-star team of homeless here in New York because we know what works and what 
[00:54:30]  doesn't.  So I'd hate to have a minor leaguer come in.  That's right.  And, you know.  We're tougher than.  Not perform.  We're tougher than those schools you're trying to get your kids into.  Oh, yeah.  We're very picky.  We're really picky.  We're like a co-op board.  Yeah.  We want to see how much our homeless can take.  Like, we need to stomp on cakes just to see what they're made of.  That was a test.  That was a test.  That was a test.  Treat yourself.  There needs to be certain aromas coming off your homeless.  Yeah.  They need to have certain medical problems. 
[00:55:00]  Can they handle their drink?  Right.  Can they drink?  Do they drink?  What kind of clothing are they wearing?  That's right.  How old is it?  That's right.  All these things add to the caliber of homeless that we have gotten over the years.  I just hope, Philly.  I have faith.  But I just hope, you know, it's not some guy with some charcoal spread to look like a beard holding a stick with a bandana on it over his shoulder. 
[00:55:30]  Got him from Central Casting.  All right.  Here we go.  We got Jake.  What's up, Jake?  Hey, morning, boy.  And Jake.  I got to tell you, man.  I was at the first one at Short Hills.  It was so fantastic.  I'm so happy you're coming back.  I know that the people there aren't, but it's going to be amazing.  Now, all we ask, because we will get, I'm not kidding.  I mean, you can see it for yourself.  We're going to have at least 1,000 to 2,000 listeners at this mall on Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m. 
[00:56:00]  We're going to take over the mall.  All we ask is to keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  No, that, you know, you don't act like an ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just help the homeless shop.  Kenny, I'm not even going to put you on mic because you're going to say something that's going to be a buzzkill.  Here it is.  Here's the buzzkill.  Here's Mr. Bad News.  Yes, he's dressed like one of the Mambo Kings.  No, since we're anticipating so many people there and there's going to be limited parking because the mall is going to be so crowded two Saturdays before Christmas, 
[00:56:30]  we arrange for overflow parking and we're going to put the address up on the website.  So people know where to park.  That's some real info?  Because there could be a real problem with parking.  I don't want to get your car towed away.  We tried to get CBS to call, but CBS didn't want to do anything.  And shave that mustache, you creep.  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're trying to grow it in again.  No, we talk about this from time to time.  Kenny had a mustache for, what, 30 years? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  It's the law when you're a kid.  Probably close to 30 years he had this mustache.  And we convinced him to shave this stupid thing off finally and go for a new look, which he did and he has accepted.  He likes his new look.  And where were we where someone said, you'll look younger than your license?  We're coming back from West Palm Beach, I think.  I get a lot of compliments.  Okay.  But he's had a mustache for so long.  I get proof that bars.  That he has to let it grow in for, what, what, Jimmy, four days?  Just to the point where it looks just downright creepy. 
[00:57:30]  He looks like one of the Brady girls when they had the painting on mustache doing, like, those little funny plays they would occasionally do at home.  A little sketch.  Yeah, a little sketch.  You are.  But the thing is, why don't you continue growing it?  You've gotten it to that point about five times since you've shaved, and then you shave it off.  And then he shaves it off.  Why not just go for it or don't?  So basically, he's shaving his entire face but letting the mustache go for, like, four days.  Just to the point where it looks really awkward and stupid, and then he shaves that back off.  I do, because I want attention from you guys. 
[00:58:00]  Aw, and look, we're giving it to him.  All right, thank you.  He just wants love.  We are going to put the details about parking and, like, what entrance we're going to arrive at so we can do it.  Because if you go in the wrong door, I'm not going to be responsible for what happens.  No, you know, like, we announced the homeless people, like, they're walking down the red carpet.  It is, like, a red carpet.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Oh, the arrival.  The arrival is amazing.  Where's the arrival this year?  We're going to â€“ we'll post the entrance.  All right, but for the people maybe that don't go on our websites like others, just kind of look for the crowd gathering. 
[00:58:30]  Because what happens â€“ I forgot about this.  Oh, the entrance.  The bus arrives, and these homeless guys â€“ by the way, someone â€“ I can't go to the phone right now because we're way too busy.  Do you guys clean the homeless?  Absolutely not.  No, no, no.  Stop it.  Dirty them.  We find them, like, sleeping on a stairwell somewhere or â€“  No, this isn't a makeover show, you idiot.  Next to a subway stop, and we get them on the bus as is.  They go as is.  And then the bus arrives. 
[00:59:00]  Did you make the announcements last year?  I think Keith does.  Keith made the â€“ yeah, it's Keith's baby in a way.  Yeah, so Keith makes the announcements.  He announces the homeless, and one by one they get off the â€“  They get off the bus to just applause like it is Oscar night.  Yeah.  And celebrities are arriving in limos.  I think this year, Andrew â€“ I see Andrew as being the â€“ like the star of the day.  The guy.  The guy.  The one that's going to get the biggest amount of cheers when he gets off of that bus.  Yeah, the guy, you know, the homeless guy where I jumped on his â€“ 
[00:59:30]  Jumped on his cake.  On his stupid cake.  Show him on the walkover when we go to XM every day.  So he's â€“ I think he's going to be a big star.  If you don't know who Andrew is, the video is up on YouTube.  I earned that cake.  If you want to check out the cake stomp.  But, yeah.  They yell out their catchphrases.  Yeah, so they're announced, and, yeah, the applause is like they're seeing rock stars.  Yeah.  Oh, they are.  They feel great for a day.  What?  The flashbulbs.  The flashbulbs and the cameras.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The entrance is going to be by the Mexican restaurant whose name I can't pronounce. 
[01:00:00]  Dopo?  Taco Bell?  I wouldn't eat that because you can get E. coli.  That's it.  There's one of the main mall entrances, and it's right next to a Mexican restaurant.  Oh, I know the restaurant.  E. coli Mexicana.  Look at Kenny.  He got a kick out of that.  If people were sick from E. coli, why wouldn't he be happy? 
[01:00:30]  He's not laughing at the joke.  He's laughing at the memory of all the illness.  Yeah, that was terrific, wasn't it?  Are they just throwing out every ingredient over there at Taco Bell?  Oh, now it's the lettuce.  It was the white onions.  No, the green onions.  It's the lettuce.  Jesus, we have no idea what it is.  It could be a tortilla.  This is the payback for illegal immigration.  Is that what it is?  Are there illegal immigrants working there?  Oh, in the fields.  Just in general.  They're pissed off they're not getting what they want from this country, and they're sick 
[01:01:00]  of doing our dirty job, so they're like, all right, look what we do now.  They're doing deuces all over our vegetables.  That's how they're going to get us back.  You watch.  Oh, brother.  They're going to hold us hostage.  Wash your vegetables, people.  They're the ones in the fields.  Do you wash the fruits and vegetables and stuff?  Hell no.  Kenny?  I don't talk about mine.  Mine's a melon.  What do you think?  Look at them, of course.  It comes in its own little sealed package.  He scrubs each individual grape.  Do you?  I know him as well as I think I do. 
[01:01:30]  Well, I do add that little extra personal touch.  Oh, that's nice.  You wash it off.  Yeah.  You don't want E. coli.  No.  Luke in Jersey.  Luke, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey.  What's up?  I got a question for you.  How are you guys going to get into the Short O's Mall?  I mean, this time of year, it's packed just with regular shoppers.  It's festive.  You know what?  I've been going to the mall every weekend, and I'm surprised at the amount of people that  aren't there.  A lot of online shopping going on. 
[01:02:00]  Huge.  This man, I'm from the area.  I'm from a town called Madison.  I'm only like 10 minutes away from the mall.  And this time around, I have to drive around for like a half hour just to find a spot in the  parking garage.  It's ridiculous.  Well, you know what?  The listeners will figure it out.  You know what?  We have a network where they're going to like carpool and do their own thing to get there.  Yeah.  Plus, we have the parking, you know, next door from the mall.  We set that up, and there's going to be a shuttle bus from that alternate parking lot  to the mall.  Yeah.  The details will be on opiananthony.com. 
[01:02:30]  All kidding aside, this has to be said, if you are going to Short Hills Mall for the homeless  shopping spree this year, just behave.  That's civilized.  Enjoy yourself and behave.  You don't have to do anything stupid to have a good time because this, I mean, this just  by itself is fun to watch.  Just behave.  I mean, you could chant and all that stuff, but just behave in the end, okay?  Taking photos with the homeless.  Just watching the horrified look on people's faces that don't understand what's going on.  All that stuff is fun-filled. 
[01:03:00]  All right, here's the details once again, but it should be up on opiananthony.com.  Hopefully it is.  Homeless shopping spree.  We are doing it this Saturday, Short Hills Mall in Jersey from 2 to 6 p.m.  We'll be live on Free FM here in New York City, 2 to 6 p.m. doing it, okay?  So you can listen in.  And they're also broadcasting it live on WISP in Philadelphia.  And for all the stations that aren't carrying it, shame, shame on you.  But it will be rebroadcast on Monday when you usually listen to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:03:30]  All right?  Right.  We're going to go to break with Gray Wolf singing Shelter Me, one of our homeless friends  who is not homeless anymore.  No, he's one of our guys that actually cleaned up his act and got himself a place to live.  We love this thing.  I was just watching footage of this from last year when he was singing this at the mall  and all the people were singing.  It was cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's in the video.  I watched it with my girlfriend, and all you see is him lumbering with the mustache,  holding up a cell phone.  Lumbering?  Yeah.  Not in a festive vibe at all. 
[01:04:00]  Hold on.  We got Gil from WISP on the line.  Gil.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hi, Gil.  Can we trust you as far as picking out a homeless guy for this?  Well, Matt and Huggy are going to do it.  They're doing it today.  They were going to do it yesterday, but it was raining, and all the homeless people were  like in hiding.  And you don't want a wet homeless guy.  But see, this is what we do.  Like, Keith the cop, he knows the homeless.  Like, the back of his hand.  Are you guys just going to pick a random homeless guy somewhere in Philly?  Well.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Hey, recipe for Deuce Haster.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  We're trying to make sure.  Ripped from the headlines.  Right.  See.  You see.  You get someone interesting enough that's kind of a kook, but somebody that we can sit  in a car for two hours with.  Yeah.  Also, this can't be a kidnapping.  Right.  You know, you have to actually kind of work up kind of almost a relationship, a rapport 
[01:05:00]  with these homeless people as we have over time.  And there doesn't seem much time left.  So it looks like what you're going to do is pull up in a dark sedan, throw them in the  trunk, and take them to New York.  Well, we got a bunch of homeless guys that live right in the same block of the station.  Yeah.  So I think there's going to be enough to pick from, like, right where we are.  All right.  We have faith, I guess.  They're going to mistake that guy that walks around as Ben Franklin for a homeless guy.  Why?  What is the man doing here?  I remember him.  He smells like he's homeless. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, he did that suit he wears.  Dirty sweatsuit.  He is a homeless guy.  Dope with buckled shoes.  I hope he's struck by a vehicle right there in front of your station.  Yeah, that didn't go so well.  Ben Franklin stinks.  No, we like Ben Franklin in the end because he sucked.  All right, Gil.  All right.  Very good, guys.  Keep us updated.  Give us a call tomorrow or have Matt and Huggy call us tomorrow and let us know who they  picked.  All right.  Very good.  I have faith.  All right.  We do have faith in WYSP.  We love WYSP. 
[01:06:00]  Thanks, Gil.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Yeah.  So Gray Wolf came in, a homeless guy.  He's not homeless anymore.  He had a little chops to him as far as music goes.  Yeah.  He plays a flute.  Mm-hmm.  And he sang a song for Tippi Tom, one of our favorite homeless guys.  The song is actually about Tippi Tom.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I hope Tippi Tom's going to make it this weekend.  Why?  Well, you never know because we've got to round these guys up.  Oh, Keith will get him.  All right.  Keith will get Tippi Tom.  He's a pro.  He's a classic. 
[01:06:30]  He is a classic.  So Gray Wolf used his talent to sing a little song about Tippi Tom.  Yeah.  Off the cuff, by the way.  Off the cuff.  Yeah.  And then we got Drew Boogie to get some music behind it.  And we just wish it was longer.  It actually would have been a really good tune.  We really believe this could have been a hit on regular radio.  And didn't they try to get him to redo it, but he just couldn't do it?  Why couldn't he do it?  No, because he couldn't recapture the moment.  It was one of those things.  And his voice wasn't right.  Because the guy went and sobered up on us.  I know. 
[01:07:00]  We should try to get him to do it again.  It's bittersweet that he slapped his life together.  It's kind of like, would you want to listen to Keith Richards if he cleaned up?  No.  Same thing.  So here's Gray Wolf.  Listen to this masterpiece as we go to break here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it on the stage.  I can hear you.  Ah, this is nice.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  This is a story about a man.  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go while we're young.  Lays at night.  And I have nowhere to go. 
[01:08:00]  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, that angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  Wait, you have bones. 
[01:08:30]  This is my life.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bones.  This is my life, I'm living with so much pain, that's just a little peace. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 Homeless Shopping Spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming this Saturday, December 16th, from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The crew from the Opie and Anthony Show is leaving New York City at 2 p.m. on Saturday  and bringing a bus full of homeless degenerates to the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey. 
[01:09:30]  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another Homeless Shopping Spree this Saturday, December 16th at the Short Hills Mall.  Bye!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  We're kind of excited. 
[01:10:00]  This morning, right around 5,  we got to see our brand new TV commercial.  Yeah.  We've been doing radio, what, 12 years together, Anthony?  Yep.  I don't think we really ever had a real TV commercial.  And now two in one year.  Yeah, we had our CBS version, our terrestrial radio, CBS version, free FM version, actually.  And it was us, you know, in the dress store.  And I really, really love...  With the chubby girl.  I really like that commercial.  Yeah.  And if you haven't seen it yet, it is on YouTube. 
[01:10:30]  But I think the commercial that's about to hit your old TV set there, I think it's even better than the dress commercial.  Uh-oh, you're going to insult people.  Yeah, I understand that.  But what can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  I'll say it's different.  It's good.  It's really good.  I thought it was very funny.  And we really believe in new media, so we're trying to make a deal with one of the websites we promote a lot.  I think Steve's on the phone waiting for a call back. 
[01:11:00]  We want to debut the commercial on the internet.  Yep.  We really want to do it that way.  And then, you know, you'll be watching TV late night or something, and then you'll see the commercial on TV as well.  It'll pop on.  And there are plenty of fun outtakes and shenanigans that'll end up on the web.  I got to tell you, Jimmy steals the show.  Oh, yeah.  Steals the show.  It's hysterical.  I just felt that I was in the moment and my acting was...  Yes, you're acting.  Anthony twisted it right.  I was Schneider. 
[01:11:30]  I was Schneider.  Schneider from one day at a time.  Let's just put it this way.  Hey, Ms. Romano.  Jimmy has an entrance.  Jimmy has an entrance in the commercial, and the commercial itself...  Befitting Jimmy.  Anthony and I are sitting in a mock studio, and they're setting up the cameras, and then  that's the point they go, so what do you guys want to do?  Yeah.  We wrote the commercial on the spot.  They had built a set and everything.  We went in... 
[01:12:00]  See, this was all very vague when we were approached to do this.  Which was much different than the other commercial we filmed.  Yeah, where we had storyboards and...  Storyboards and meetings and...  Scripts and script revisions and all kinds of stuff.  In this one, they kind of said, hey, we're doing an XM commercial, and it's going to be  about you guys.  So we're like, okay, I figure it's going to be like Sam and his camera in the studio.  Let me tape you guys, and then we'll put like a graphic that says O&A.  And that's what I thought it was going to be. 
[01:12:30]  So we go to a studio, and they built a set.  And so there's a set built, there's dolly tracks laid, there's cameras set up, a director,  you know, everything there to film a commercial.  They're ready to go, except for a script.  Except no script.  No script at all.  So we sit down on the set.  I don't want to give away any of it.  No.  And we just...  We sit down on the set, and we start thinking, okay, me, you, Jimmy, and this set, go. 
[01:13:00]  And then I'm like, all right, I'll say this.  And then it goes, well, if you say this, I'll say this.  I'll say this.  And then Jimmy's saying like, the whole context of it doesn't really work unless this is like  that.  So we're working it out as the dolly guy is pushing the camera and shooting.  And practicing his shots.  And like they're, you know, running through the shots.  So we had like minutes to get this together.  I want to tell XM, you guys are lucky.  XM, you guys are lucky that we pulled this out of our you-know-what. 
[01:13:30]  And then we'll just say this much.  And then so we worked out what Ant and I wanted to say.  And then Jimmy has this entrance, let's just say.  And then Ant comes up with the great idea that it's got to be a sitcom entrance.  Wow.  We can say that much.  Don't blow it.  We can say that much.  Well, I wouldn't go any further.  All right.  All right.  It's just a very funny joke.  It's a very funny joke.  I'm very excited.  I want the listeners to see this spot immediately.  So hopefully we'll get an update from Steve maybe before we get off the air here. 
[01:14:00]  And maybe you can start, you know, seeing this thing later on this afternoon.  No, he doesn't yell the N-word at the Kramer entrance.  I yell at help and ant.  That would be funny.  It certainly would be.  I think we, yeah, I think we shot this before the Kramer incident, unfortunately.  That would have been very funny.  So we're very excited.  We'll have more info on the brand-new TV commercial hopefully within the next hour.  We'll see.  Slow news day, but this Yoko thing is kind of weird, huh?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  I guess she's got, what, a chauffeur and he's in trouble for threatening her life.  Well, they arrested him last night.  And trying to extort money from her.  Yeah.  Says that he has been taping her, taping her personal conversations.  And this was odd when I heard it on the news station when I drove in this morning.  He has embarrassing photos of her, which I thought was just about every photo of Yoko.  But apparently he's got some embarrassing. 
[01:15:00]  But there's ones of her.  We've seen pictures of Yoko completely nude with John.  With what amounts to, I don't know how to put it here, but it looks like what we used to call a pool rack.  Go to your local pool hall where a pool table is.  Look at the rack you used to rack up the balls with.  And now go to a barbershop.  I'll give you time.  Sweep up the floor.  Now fill up that pool rack with all the hair from the floor. 
[01:15:30]  That's what's been photographed on Yoko.  And he's got more embarrassing photos than that.  He's brilliant.  The cover of the, what album is that?  With her naked and John naked.  John spooning with her.  I don't know.  I wasn't a very big John Lennon fan to tell you the truth.  He was taping her in the car.  Not solo.  He was taping her in the car.  And he's denying any wrongdoing, but they have two different evidences.  What, driving? 
[01:16:00]  That would be embarrassing.  Her driving.  Just making wrong turns and cutting people off.  Blinker on.  You read the transcript.  That's right.  An Asian joke.  Is that okay, John?  John Lennon?  You read the transcript.  It just says, babble crash sound.  And then like a minute later, babble screeching tires behind.  Babble.  Other driver yelling racial epithet out window.  Ching chong.  Ching.  Ching chong.  Rocio John Lennon.  Is John Lennon called back, by the way?  No.  Howard. 
[01:16:30]  Sorry, we're not going to bend over and kiss.  He wants people who are going to kiss his ass and be afraid of him.  And be afraid.  We think you stink.  What do you think?  What do you think of them crab apples?  Councilman John Lue.  Call anytime you want, man.  We'll discuss your agenda.  Yoko.  A $2 million extort ordeal.  A conniving chauffeur blackmailed Yoko Ono with embarrassing tapes and photos he claimed  to have secretly recorded.  Then threatened to kill the widow of Beatle John Lennon.  Did they need to add that? 
[01:17:00]  For refusing to pay John Lennon.  For refusing to pay John Lennon, who played in the band The Beatles.  Right.  It's Yoko.  Couldn't they just say, you know, John's widow?  I think we know.  You know who Yoko is?  They had to say the widow of Beatle John Lennon.  Beatle John Lennon.  The Beatles had a few hits back in the 60s.  Yeah, they don't want you to, you know, be confused with the other John Lennon out there.  Right.  For refusing to pay $2 million in hush money.  Hush.  They arrested this guy.  Hush money.  At his Long Island home.  Ono blew the whistle.  As he was led out of the 20th. 
[01:17:30]  Blew the whistle.  Blew.  Blew the whistle.  As he was led out of the 20th Precinct Station House on the Upper West Side last night to  go downtown for booking on a charge of attempted grand larceny, the handcuffed Carson made  his own shocking allegation that Ono.  Wow.  A handcuffed.  Oh, not that, Carson.  Sorry.  The handcuffed Carson made his own shocking allegation that Ono had sexually harassed him.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  He's a Turk, too.  He's a Turkish guy. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Like a Turkish military guy.  Yep.  See the two of them all tangled up?  His nickname is Coco.  Ew.  It was Yoko and Coco.  Are you kidding?  No crap, man.  To be honest, there wasn't a little crazy Spanish boy.  He would have been Loco.  Too bad they didn't sing with Kaz Elliott.  They all could have Choco'd.  His quote.  His quote.  She said Mark Chapman wasn't a worse shot.  She would have Choco'd.  I'll keep going with awful, awful rhymes. 
[01:18:30]  She's just trying to stop me from pursuing a sexual harassment case is what he was saying  last night.  When asked specifically if 73-year-old Ono had made unwanted advances, Carson boasted, oh,  so many times.  Really?  Yeah.  His ego just needs a stroko.  Of course, Ono is denying these allegations.  You think Yoko Ono's had sex since John Lennon's death? 
[01:19:00]  I'm going to guess she has.  Probably some Upper East Side or Upper West Side art dealer.  Like an art guy.  Just some boar who has like long hair over his collared shirts.  Like a Spalding gray hairdo.  Yeah.  Some crushing, horrible boar.  Because she's a boar.  Yeah, she really is.  She's tediously boar.  She has nothing.  She's never said anything I've wanted to hear.  No.  You can't.  The story gets better.  Cops said Carson gave Ono a rambling two-page type note on Friday, the 26th anniversary 
[01:19:30]  of her husband's murder, complaining about long work hours and threatening her with audio  tapes and photos that would embarrass her.  He wanted the $2 million or he would go public.  Does this stuff ever work?  Scumbag.  Do these little scams ever work?  I'm sure they do.  You never hear about them.  Extortion like that?  I'm sure.  People write a letter?  If he was taping her in her own car like that just to blackmail her, just what a  vulture.  Yeah.  Just be shot. 
[01:20:00]  Along with the threatening letter, Carson allegedly told Ono he had been her lover,  gave her a photo in which she's wearing revealing nightwear.  Oh, boy.  And showed her another photo of a box filled with video and audio tapes purportedly with  hours of potentially damaging footage.  He has her recorded talking against the British government and the American government and Sean  being derogatory about his father.  Big deal. 
[01:20:30]  Ono immediately denied being Carson's lover during the heated confrontation.  At one point, she threw her pocketbook at him.  If I don't get the money, I'll kill her.  Well, if it was full of all the money she's got, that could have hurt.  Yeah, right?  Jesus.  It was full of her album sale receipts.  You know, for her talent.  It would have floated away like it was full of helium.  Yeah, she threw up the purse.  A nice wind would have just taken it.  My fucker book.  My fucker book.  That's right.  Funny accent. 
[01:21:00]  Where'd go?  Been here how long?  Come on, Yoko.  What kind of embarrassing footage could you have?  She's playing that full metal jacket part.  All me so horny and she's just acting it out in a house coat.  Craig on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, if these allegations are true, isn't she going to look like a dodo?  Like a dodo?  I curse you today.  But he didn't do it right.  No.  Is that dodo?  No. 
[01:21:30]  It's, you know, that was just a bad joko.  See, sir?  See, that's how it's done.  And Coco.  Jimmy on Long Island.  Jimmy.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I really tried to embarrass her by playing her records in public.  Oh, yeah.  That would not be good.  Yeah.  We have Rock and Roll Circus, one of our favorite things ever.  Jay Moore turned us on to this.  It's a little film that the Rolling Stones did. 
[01:22:00]  They invited their friends to some kind of circus tent.  And everyone in the audience had to wear, like, rain slickers,  like, yellow rain slickers, if I remember correctly.  They were high.  They were as high as you can get.  And they invited their friends, like, who's in this?  I got to remember.  Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton.  Peter Frampton.  Peter Frampton.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I just said that.  I don't think so.  Jimmy Page, definitely.  Eric Clapton, definitely.  Foundry. 
[01:22:30]  John Lennon.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr was there.  We performed Pendulum.  We all shine on.  John Lennon, of course, with Yoko.  So, and basically, I think they all just dropped acid, got really high,  and then they went for one of these all-star jams.  Yeah.  So, you got the Rolling Stones on stage.  You got John Lennon singing with Mick Jagger.  Right there is worth the price of admission.  You got Jimmy Page. 
[01:23:00]  You got Eric Clapton.  All on the stage.  Classic rock and roll moment.  And they are jamming, doing one of these all-star jams,  and then effing Yoko steps up to the mic and wrecks the whole thing.  Why?  Why did she have to open her freaking mouth?  Why didn't John Lennon tell her, stay home?  I know.  For everybody that loves John Lennon and his music and everything,  for all that, he was the most whipped guy for not just telling her,  hey, could you back off? 
[01:23:30]  I'm the one with the talent that everyone's talking about here.  And it was known back then, if you want John, you get Yoko too.  So, the Rolling Stones is like, oh, my God, a chance to do something with John Lennon.  All right, fine.  This awful package deal.  Just the fact that he would force her on everybody,  self-righteously force her on everybody.  That's great.  And she stinks.  Here's a Lamborghini and cancer.  You don't get the cancer, but you have to put it in the passenger seat and talk to it.  So, from Rock and Roll Circus, here's the all-star jam going down, 
[01:24:00]  and you, as the listener, you have to guess when Yoko starts singing.  It's tough.  It's really tough.  Listen closely.  Listen closely.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh. 
[01:25:00]  Why?  She just goes on and on with that caterwauling.  Someone's saying, that's what the last three seconds of Hiroshima sounded like.  Oh.  All right, John.  You want to call now?  Wow.  Wow.  It's a break it down. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, she's doing something that pretty much every human being out there could do.  What's so special about this, if you even want to go with the artsy angle?  She's screaming.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:26:30]  Star Wars  Star Wars  Star Wars  Stop, stop, stop  Oh, I can't wait. 
[01:27:00]  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Georgia.  It's Georgia.  That's an attention get.  She sucks and shame on Lennon.  Oh, yeah, what point did, like, Clapton go, is this a f***ing Joko? 
[01:27:30]  All that talent on one stage, and he has to force his broad on everybody.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole.  Let's say hi to Sean and Bayona.  Sean, what's up?  We're just joking about you, Mom, dude.  Every time the Joko sings, it sounds just like Stroko.  That's cool, man.  You should treat yourself after that one with a Smoko. 
[01:28:00]  I don't mind.  Like, I prefer rock.  I mean, I also enjoy Foko.  That's right, folks.  I'm going to keep irritating you with this tired bitch.  Wow.  Richard wants to help you there, Jimmy.  Uh-oh.  Richard, St. Louis, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  I heard they were messed up because they were all drinking Soko.  What?  You know, Southern Comfort.  John Lennon, his problem was he was a whipped bloco. 
[01:28:30]  John in Arlington, what's up?  Hey, sounds like we got somebody who just got tased again.  Yeah, it sounds like tased, tased the audio.  And we actually have audio of John Lennon on the ride home with Joko.  He was none too happy.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Wow.  Lost his accent and everything.  He certainly did.  He really hollered at her.  And this just in, congratulations to Yoko Ono.  She just won MacBook karaoke today. 
[01:29:00]  We'll be delivering her MacBook to the Dakota later on this afternoon.  All right.  We have to take a break.  We're in the middle of a riff here.  Yeah, fam, with your break sign.  I know, son.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Yeah, we still got to do MacBook karaoke, actually.  It's my job.  Peter Boyle died.  Yeah.  We did not mention that.  Yeah.  Young Frankenstein.  You know what?  I was trying to explain to Lindsay who Peter Boyle was.  Mm-hmm.  And I refused to acknowledge that he was on Everybody Loves Raymond. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that might have helped.  So it made it really tough to try to explain it to her.  It was probably the most...  Like, character actor, gritty detective in a lot of movies.  He's...  Yeah, don't pick the most visible thing he's been on.  Dude, I'm telling you, man.  After Seinfeld, I did not watch Friends.  I did not watch Everybody Loves Raymond.  I might have seen one episode of Friends, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  A peek here and there when it's on.  And Everybody Loves Raymond, maybe I've seen one or two episodes.  Maybe. 
[01:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  See, I stopped right before you.  You went into Seinfeld.  I stopped before Seinfeld.  The thing after the taxi, I was finished.  Wow.  You're really going back.  I did MASH.  Yeah, I can't remember anything even in the late 80s I watched.  Jesus.  Mine was the Texaco Star Theater.  After that, it was all downhill.  Right.  After the Bob Hope, no melanin only hour.  All right.  All right.  Hey, you know...  We didn't get to half the crap.  We have another hour, though.  That's good.  We've got to get to Obama's name trouble. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, of course.  We have to get to reducing your toddler's holiday stress.  And we got some horrific Christmas songs today.  Are they on the way?  Yes.  I heard some big laughs from the office, so...  Hell are toddlers stressed out about?  We'll find out next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.

Yeah, I learned that last night when they were doing the old looking back piece that they  do when these Hollywood actors die.  I had no idea.  Did you?  No.  You want to find out about reducing your toddler's holiday stress? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, why are toddlers stressed out?  Hey, Andrea Yates.  I have no idea.  The holidays can be very stressful.  Time for everybody.  Why are toddlers stressed?  Exactly.  Don't they have everything done for them?  What?  I don't know, let's get into this.  All right, all you parents out there, the last thing you want for Christmas is a cranky kid,  right?  Yeah.  So how do you make sure your child is stress-free this holiday season? 
[01:32:30]  Joining me with some tips is child development specialist Lori Barrett.  Good to see you, Lori.  Good morning.  And you brought along some of these beautiful children today.  We did.  We're talking about toddlers especially and the stress that they may feel during the holiday  season because, quite frankly, they don't know what's going on, right?  That's exactly right.  And with children this young, you have two things in mind.  One is that you want them to be able to enjoy the holidays and get the meaning out of the  holidays in the way that we do.  And we also don't want...  Oh, could you tell it it's on TV?  Yeah.  Could you tell it it's on TV and you're ruining it? 
[01:33:00]  They don't get it?  They don't even understand they're on TV.  How are they going to understand the concept of Christmas?  They don't.  Kids do whatever they want at that age.  There's no training them.  You can't tell them to do something.  I'm sure she said, now we're going to...  The big people are going to talk.  Now you have to sit here and be quiet.  And in two seconds...  Mommy, I can't live in there.  Mommy, I can't...  Director should have came over and slapped that kid's face. 
[01:33:30]  Shut up.  We're trying to do a show.  Have you checked out that new show yet?  I forgot the name of it.  Maybe someone can help me.  They get like three families that have problem children and they live in a house and then the  child psychologists are on site.  No, I've watched the nanny shows.  Oh, no.  This is so much worse, man.  Really?  And I do love kids.  I absolutely do.  A little different than these two.  So does John Carr.  Go to Thailand, you sicko. 
[01:34:00]  It almost makes me say I don't want to have kids ever.  These kids are a nightmare.  And then you got the child psychologist explaining to the parents what they could do as the kid  is just throwing tantrums, screaming bloody murder, and they give them some advice and  help them through their problems.  Cursing and spitting at their parents.  Oh, it's a great show, but your blood pressure goes up as you watch this at home.  That's how those nanny shows are, though.  I'll tell you, because they show them just freaking out. 
[01:34:30]  They show these kids freaking out, and I watch it and go, oh, my God, I would kill them.  I would be in prison because I couldn't take it.  Well, check out this show one night.  You'll lose your mind.  All right, so now, I don't know what they were saying here because the kid's babbling  in the background.  I backed it up a little bit.  Enjoy the holidays and get the meaning out of the holidays in the way that we do.  And we also don't want them to make a big mess for everybody and ruin the holidays for  themselves and for you and for everybody else. 
[01:35:00]  Right, because everyone's going, oh, look at those kids, blah, blah, blah.  When you become a parent, you suddenly understand all that.  By the way, the show's called House of Tiny Terrors.  Thank you, Rum Runner.  House of Tiny Terrors.  Rum Runner from Whack Bag.  Oh, yeah, it's just screaming and tantrums, and they got, like, the night vision cameras  in the bedrooms.  Oh, cool.  You see the kids just pacing back and forth and just destroying stuff.  Little animals.  Screaming and yelling.  You got little animals in your house.  You're not allowed to whack on the nose with a newspaper.  Not anymore. 
[01:35:30]  When we were growing up.  Let me tell you.  Hot Wheels track.  Right across the back of the place.  That's what I used to get.  Right across the butt.  A Hot Wheels track.  Hot.  One of your toys.  They'd use your own toys against you as a kid.  How cruel is that?  Something that's supposed to be fun for you.  You're snapping together your Hot Wheels track and having flashbacks and getting beat  with it.  It's like giving a slave a whip and going, here, have fun.  Have fun with this.  And you as a kid, you have no clue that that's the real reason they bought the Hot Wheels tracks. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Because they're probably, as they're, like, buying the gifts, going, well, I could hit  them nice with that.  The wooden spoon.  Right.  Great.  You give a kid an eating disorder.  Can't look at a spoon.  Been whacked with it over the head.  Talk to your toddler about the holidays.  Show them pictures of past holidays and relatives.  They're stupid.  They don't understand.  All right, Lori, let's talk about your tips.  Be prepared.  You're supposed to talk to your toddler about the holidays.  Exactly.  And start now.  You know, don't do this the day before the holiday events.  Start now. 
[01:36:30]  There's a number of easy things that parents can do that will really help the children  get into the holidays.  You know, certainly one is to show them family photo albums of the people that they're going  to be seeing on the holidays.  So these might not be the people that are normally, you know, in their life.  Crying at page one.  And show them pictures of who they're going to be seeing.  Grandma and grandpa.  Grandma and grandpa.  Show them pictures of who they're going to be seeing.  You point at an uncle and the kid just starts crawling under the couch in the fetal position.  Just starts wailing.  I think they should show you pictures of relatives you're not going to see.  Like, show you everyone that's died and then just say, like, you know, what stage of 
[01:37:00]  decomposition they're in at the moment.  You won't be seeing her.  Remember how nice she was?  Well, she was beaten to death in an alley.  What a waste of time.  You would sit the kid down.  I know kids enough to know.  You sit them down with a photo album.  Mm-hmm.  And page one.  Eh.  It's not cartoony.  Right.  It's not.  You can't grab crayons and deface it.  Oh.  They wouldn't be interested. 
[01:37:30]  Kids can't color worth a crap, too.  You ever see kids' coloring books?  Jesus Christ.  Use more than one color.  And try to stay in the lines.  I saw.  Dopey little things.  I saw.  If I had kids and they painted a son blue, I would smack him.  Oh.  Learn the Arab's ways.  It's not the right color, you idiot.  No.  Bad boy.  Bad boy.  All right.  Of who they're going to be seeing.  Grandma and grandpa.  Grandma and grandpa.  Show them pictures of past holidays that they might have been a part of as well.  Because they love to see pictures of themselves.  Right.  So that's always a good thing to do. 
[01:38:00]  Don't show my daughter any pictures of Santa.  Because she's determined she doesn't like Santa.  Yes.  Which is.  It's the beard.  Yes.  Really?  A kid does.  This is just a waste of time for the news.  They don't need to do this.  What kid does really like Santa?  My kid doesn't like Santa.  It's the beard.  No.  I don't think that.  I think it was the scent of whiskey and that one mall gentleman whose lap she was forced  to bounce on, you dopey parent.  Nothing to do with the beard.  Isn't a Santa.  Yeah.  It's that scary guy at the store. 
[01:38:30]  Plan ahead.  Prepare for different things in their lives.  Like maybe new pets.  That sort of thing they may encounter.  But this is certainly true.  One thing that you want to do is you want to find out where the event is going to be  that you're going to and find out what the layout is.  What things are you going to need to bring?  Who's going to be there?  And kind of scope out in your mind how you see this.  Show world.  Hang out for yourself.  Peep show.  Topless joint.  Whatever.  You're going to see boobies. 
[01:39:00]  Don't be scared.  That is the dumbest bit of advice.  Stress free toddler.  You don't have to worry about the toddler.  And you're selfish to bring them over relatives house.  Selfish until they reach an age where they're civilized a bit.  Where they could actually talk and be polite.  What's that age in your world?  20?  20.  Exactly.  When you bring over kids that are infants, you can almost tolerate because, all right, 
[01:39:30]  they're new.  They're not even cooked yet.  You can't leave them at home.  You can't leave.  So you're kind of forced to.  But there's a certain age where just don't show up then because you're ruining everyone's time.  What age is that?  Two?  Three?  Probably.  The terrible twos?  The one into the twos.  Now, one's easy.  What?  One's easy.  Like the tail end of the ones into the beginning of the twos kind of area where they're just  nasty, yelling, can't be told anything.  Let's say hi to Jackie and Merrick. 
[01:40:00]  Jackie.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you?  Good morning.  Good morning, Jackie.  I have not stopped laughing.  Ooh.  I hate people's kids.  What are you listening to?  I want to turn that on.  You hate what?  I hate people's kids.  Good for you.  Oh, you do?  Good girl.  I have two.  Oh, you have two?  I have two.  You ever think people hate your kids, Sue?  I discipline.  I discipline.  I don't care who's standing there.  I yell at them.  You can't talk.  I get caught it on the butt.  I don't care.  If they're disrespectful or talk back or touch things that aren't supposed to be touched, 
[01:40:30]  I hit them.  You can't talk logic with a toddler.  No.  And you see adults trying to talk logically to a kid, and it's embarrassing.  Now, we're going to go inside this place.  It's very quiet.  So you're going to need to be blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, cry, scream, blah,  blah, blah.  They just hear Charlie Brown's teacher.  That's all.  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  They don't hear that.  They can't put two and two together where you're saying it's a quiet place. 
[01:41:00]  No.  Kids want something.  They're going to cry and scream for it.  Until they get it.  All right.  Enough of that crap.  It's writing crops.  Writing crops for all parents.  It's time for MacBook Karaoke.  Oh, my favorite part of the show this week.  Where's my sheet?  We've been giving out MacBooks all week, and it's time to give out another MacBook.  We've been doing MacBook Karaoke.  We've got three finalists today.  Yes.  Who will win the MacBook today?  Ooh.  Will it be Andrea, the cake lady?  We found her entry. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, wow.  Will it be George?  There's no promo sheet.  All right.  Well, I figured that much out.  Yeah.  Jesus.  What?  We don't have to say anything.  We don't have to say anything.  What?  Now that E-Rock decided that it was really important to completely distract me, why don't you  now talk on mic?  Al said we don't have to promote it.  Al, what did he say?  What?  That was it.  That was it? 
[01:42:00]  What do you mean we have to promote it?  I want to hear more.  We usually have a plug for this bit.  We don't have one today.  That was worth running over here and pointing at the screen.  Oh.  But, Eric.  Like, there was breaking news?  Like, stop everything, guys.  You've got to talk about this.  What sheet were you asking for?  It was just the slug sheet, you know, where it's the big plug.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, E-Rock.  But Al said we don't have to.  I guess what Al says goes.  That's right.  All right.  It's MacBook Karaoke.  We've got three finalists.  We'll start with Andrea the Cake Lady. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah?  All right.  She's singing Total Eclipse of the Heart.  Oh, great.  Is this worth a MacBook?  Every now and then I fall apart.  And I need you now tonight.  And I need you more than ever.  And if you only hold me tight.  If you only hold me tight.  We'll be holding on forever.  And we'll only be making it right.  Because we'll never be wrong. 
[01:43:00]  Together we can take it to the end of the line.  Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.  I don't know what to do because I'm always in the dark.  We're living in a power gag and setting up for us.  I really need you tonight.  Forever is going to start.  She ain't bad.  Not at all.  Jesus.  Forever is going to start. 
[01:43:30]  I was falling in love.  But now I'm only falling apart.  Wow.  All right.  She sucks at baking, but she can sing a tune.  Yeah.  That wasn't bad at all.  She got a real cool voice.  All right.  That 80s rocker chick voice.  Like Raspi.  Yeah.  Had a few too many cigarettes and a few too many shots.  Give up the baking.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  What about George doing separate ways? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, no.  Here we stand.  Welcome, home, home.  Broken in two, two, two.  Sleepless nights.  Oh, Jesus.  Losing ground.  I'm reaching for you.  You.  Reaching for that note.  You.  Oh.  Feeling that is gone. 
[01:44:30]  Can't change your mind.  Can we ask the contestants to please not sing  while you're on one of those old-fashioned fat-burning things?  The belt you put around your butt and it shakes you?  Was that recorded during the San Francisco earthquake? 
[01:45:00]  What's with his voice?  Whenever he had to hit a note, Michael J. Fox would just hug him.  All right, we have one last finalist today.  It's Andrew doing Living on a Prayer.  I'm living on a prayer.  Mommy's got a street string in heart.  Now he's holding him in what he used to be.  He didn't are so tough.  Uh-oh.  It's tough. 
[01:45:30]  Gina dreams of running away.  When cries in the night, Tommy with the baby.  Can he at least try?  It's okay.  Put 1% of effort into this?  I'm trying to win.  I like the group factor.  Or is it so awful?  Yeah, but it's not.  We've got to hold on to what we've got.  Because it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not.  Oh, he cried there.  We've got each other.  We'll make it or not. 
[01:46:00]  And that's the lot for us.  We'll give it a shot.  Whoa, we're halfway there.  Whoa, we're living on prayer.  What?  He should win our Bud Dwyer's lunch.  That little bag.  Yeah, he opens it up, he thinks it's a MacBook, and he goes, well, I guess I have to.  All right, Andrew's out.  Totally.  Yeah, I think so.  That guy sucks.  So it's Separate Ways or Andrea, the cake lady? 
[01:46:30]  Separate Ways is hysterically funny.  And if Andrea wasn't so good, I would give it to him because he's funny.  But she was really good.  She was good.  I think she earned it.  Yep.  So we'll give it to Andrea, the cake lady, for singing Totally Clips of the Heart?  That's my choice.  She'll wind up eating it, too.  She'll probably bake it or something.  Mac cake.  Look, Mac cookies.  All right, Andrea, you want a MacBook as part of MacBook karaoke for this.  Yep.  Some people are suggesting we put the mac in an oven and cook it first. 
[01:47:00]  Give it to it.  All burnt.  We can take it to the end of the line.  Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. 
[01:47:30]  I don't know what to do because I'm always in the dark.  We're living in a powder gag and setting off sparks.  I really need you tonight.  The rest is going to start.  Didn't she say she sings?  Yeah.  She has a band or something?  And we didn't believe her.  Is she a band?  I don't know if she said that.  I don't think she's got a band.  I think she does karaoke and enjoys singing kind of thing.  Well, she claims she could sing, what was it, Bobby McGee? 
[01:48:00]  Right.  Better than your mom.  Well, I could see that.  Look at Babe Ruth 10 minutes before he died.  Here's Andrea, the winner of the MacBook from New York City.  Andrea.  Hi.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Yeah.  Because I don't have a computer, so.  Well, now you do.  Lovely Mac.  Thank you so much.  What pill will you be popping to celebrate this morning?  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  I think I might go to sleep after this.  You actually win as part of the MacBook.  You win to get a duet with Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  You do the harmonies and pendulum.  You sound pretty good.  Thank you, Anthony.  I know you have a really good voice.  Oh, thank you.  No, thank you.  Mutual admiration crap.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  No.  Your mom was awful yesterday.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Yeah.  I talked to her last night, and she called me up and was like, I got calls from people  telling me I was on the radio. 
[01:49:00]  I was like, yeah, it was your famous, you know, drunken clip of you singing.  She's like, oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  She's thrilled every time she makes the air.  Yeah.  There you go.  Well, congratulations, Andrea.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  All right, Andrea.  Fine entry.  Bye.  Enjoy the MacBook.  Let's say hi to Lauren in Jersey.  Lauren.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi, Lauren.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  What's up?  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Hey, I wanted you to play that clip of the karaoke trick from yesterday.  The one you said you wanted to download onto your iPod, Anthony. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, I got to hear that again today.  That was hysterical.  What was it?  That was from yesterday.  Oh, was it I saw the sign?  Yeah.  Which one was it?  I saw the sign?  I saw the sign.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  That was it.  Yeah, it's worth it.  She does this really weird affected voice thing that is hysterical.  All right, Lauren, for you.  Here it is.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  So bad.  I've got a new life. 
[01:50:00]  You would hardly recognize you.  I'm so glad.  Love this.  I'm a new person.  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  There's a ghost in here.  I saw the sign.  Oh, she stinks. 
[01:50:30]  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  I'll use you, you find me.  Oh.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  Where is she from?  Is she in New York?  Oh, Long Island.  That's obvious to me.  Yeah.  Oh, that is Long Island all the way.  Sam's from New York, too.  And look how he talks.  I'd love to get her in here to belt that out in person.  Oh, would that be great to hear?  It took me 10 years to get rid of that accent. 
[01:51:00]  Wonderful.  I didn't recognize that as Long Island.  I had the time of my life.  Do you want to play that going into break?  Oh, which one is that?  The, um...  Well, we're doing a little karaoke.  The, uh...  The two waterheads.  Mentally challenged couple.  The two waterheads.  Mentally challenged.  It's actually a hot band.  It's called The Photograph Records.  Yeah, they went to some amusement park and were singing, um...  We can only give them a taste, because it's five minutes long, but it's two waterheads 
[01:51:30]  getting together to sing Time of My Life.  They went into a little recording booth and sang this song.  One of our greatest clips, thanks to one of our own a-pass that worked at one of these  booths.  Yep.  Where you do the karaoke.  Yeah.  And, uh, somebody thought it'd be cute to have these two waterheads try to sing Time  of My Life.  The guy was laughing so, uh, so hard, he, he dubbed off a copy and sent it to us immediately.  Yeah.  It's great.  Here it is, Time of My Life, on the Opie and Anthony show.  I had the time of my life, now I've never felt this way before, yes, I swear, it's the 
[01:52:00]  truth, and I owe it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of my life, now I've always felt this way before, yes, I've been waiting 
[01:52:30]  for so long, now I've finally found this one to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall, and you've felt the magic of fantasy.  Yeah, every time we did it all right, it's the way, because it's nice secretly.  Yeah, we take each other's hands, cause we think we understand, just don't cheat. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, we take each other's hands, cause we think we understand, just don't cheat.  Yeah, we take each other's hands, cause we think we understand, just don't cheat.  Yeah, we take each other's hands, cause we think we understand, just don't cheat.  Yeah, we take each other's hands, cause we think we understand, just don't cheat.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:53:30]  Coming this Saturday, December 16th, from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern. 
[01:54:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The crew from the Opie and Anthony show is leaving New York City at 2 p.m. on Saturday  and bringing a bus full of homeless degenerates to the Short Hills Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey.  Golden buns is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit,  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree this Saturday, December 16th, at the Short Hills Mall.  Bye!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, let's get right back into this. 
[01:54:30]  It is the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a question from Jeff in North Carolina.  Jeff, what's up?  On the map to Short Hills, New Jersey, on the map.  I was wondering what town it was in.  Short Hills?  Yeah.  I think what Jeff is trying to say, he wants to come up for the homeless shopping spree?  Yeah.  And he wants to know where Short Hills Mall is in Jersey.  He's in North Carolina.  Uh, Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  It's in Millburn, New Jersey, at Route 24 and JFK Parkway. 
[01:55:00]  There you go.  We'll have more details tomorrow.  I think some of the details are up on opiananthony.com for the homeless shopping spree.  Steve is giving me a thumbs up.  If you need to know about the homeless shopping spree, go to opiananthony.com.  Jeff, we'll see you Saturday, all right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Seems like a lot of people are traveling for the homeless shopping spree.  Just don't try to say hi to Kenny and then accidentally address a Chess King mannequin.  That's a visual, but what the hell, man? 
[01:55:30]  I love that suit.  Just use your imagination.  It's very accurate.  With that creepy four-day mustache drop.  Kenny's graduating high school today.  Where's my Capizio shoes?  There's a dance to go to.  You've got to put on a thin tie, the 1984 thin ties that were kind of ironic.  Hey, a lot of the country's talking about Obama.  Are they?  Chicago's own Obama.  Yeah.  He's on the cover of magazines.  He's going on Larry King. 
[01:56:00]  He's on the TV.  Will he run?  Will he not run?  Everyone's discussing the presidential election in a couple of years.  So he's popping up as one of the Democratic frontrunners.  And what was this with him getting on the same ticket as Hillary Clinton?  Yeah, that'll work.  50 to 0.  51 if you include Puerto Rico.  That's what it would be.  Just.  50 to nothing.  Please.  Republicans take every state.  Every state.  Especially if they run Giuliani.  Yeah.  Which if they don't, they're dummies. 
[01:56:30]  Because these conservative Republicans have just sucked.  It'd be a gag ticket.  That would be a joke ticket.  Yeah.  To Obama or Clinton.  I think he's pretty liberal.  I don't know who I'd like more out of those two.  But I think he's got a really liberal voting record.  He's well-spoken.  He gets people excited.  Oh, is that what people look for?  He's getting people very excited.  Yes.  As far as a black candidate goes, as long as they're well-spoken.  He's only part black.  We're going to learn that he's also.  Like Tiger.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Also part dead body with those stupid blue lips of his. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  I'm tired of his frozen person lips.  Oh, my.  He's fall out and then run.  It is an unusual color, Jimmy.  I'll give you that much.  Well, the problem here with Obama, besides the obvious, if you listen to Anthony and Jimmy,  is his name.  Yeah.  People are having a problem with his name.  Obama is too close to Osama.  It's too close to Osama.  And now we also learn that his middle name is not much better.  Oh, no.  There's not just buzz about this guy.  It's more like a scream.  Senator Barack Obama! 
[01:57:30]  Senator Barack Obama!  He was red hot in New Hampshire.  I am fired up.  But not everyone knows him.  Who exactly is Barack Obama?  I don't know who you're talking about.  Maybe that explains how someone could confuse Obama with Osama.  Only one little consonant differentiates the two names.  And as if that similarity weren't enough, how about sharing the name of a former dictator?  And you know his middle name?  Hussein.  Hitler. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, get out.  You're kidding me?  That's right.  Barack Hussein Obama.  Well, that's not what Oprah calls him.  Senator Barack Obama.  The Hussein part was his Kenyan grandfather's first name.  I mean, it'd be one thing if my name was John Hussein Smith.  When you're already starting with Barack Obama, uh...  Oof.  That's it.  Well, the Democrats always seem to put a humorous candidate.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Did any of them have to deliver a joke?  That's just, you know...  You know, when you start off with Barack Obama, you have to... 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  I phrased that differently.  How about a punchline?  Yeah.  Barack...  John Kerry.  Barack Hussein Obama.  Hussein.  Oh, it's over, John.  His name should be Molester Hitler Stalin.  That would be a little easier to vote for.  Stupid.  So remember, pull the handle for...  I don't care about the Obama Osama name.  That's not a big deal.  But the Hussein one is kind of funny.  That's his middle name.  How could we possibly have a president with the name Hussein? 
[01:59:00]  His middle name, I don't care what it is.  Yeah.  Even though it's just his middle name.  It's Hussein.  Yeah.  President Juhater said today...  Yeah.  Jesus.  You're not going to get the Jewish vote.  This just in.  This just in.  WBCN will be carrying the homeless shopping spree live on Saturday when we do it.  Thank goodness.  They came to their senses in Boston.  Yes.  The homeless shopping spree happens Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m.  We'll be live here in New York City Saturday from 2 to 6 giving you all the play-by-play 
[01:59:30]  of the homeless shopping spree as they go to Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  WYSP in Philly decided to pick up the show live on Saturday.  And now WBCN has done the right thing.  And they will also be picking up the show live on Saturday as we do the homeless shopping spree.  All the info is up on OpieNanthony.com.  Let's go to Joey in Jersey.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I don't know if you guys have ever been to Short Hills Mall, have you?  I may have been. 
[02:00:00]  We did a homeless shopping spree a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Right there.  Oh, man.  I wouldn't be surprised if this thing makes the papers, man.  Because that place, you need to have some big money in there.  And, yeah.  Yeah, we know.  Joey, we know all this.  We did the homeless shopping spree there once before, sir.  Yeah, your job as a listener is to show up to Short Hills Mall and help the homeless shop this year.  This Saturday from 2 to 6.  I wouldn't be surprised if they just, you know, had some cross-ready for you guys. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Thank you.  They're just going to look crazy.  I don't think he understands.  No, he doesn't.  He's like a child.  Guys, you might get in big.  You might get in Dutch.  You ever been there?  We did it before there.  Yeah, but if you did, if you've ever been there, you'd know that, well, we did.  Yeah?  Those people are going to freak out.  They've never seen anything.  No, we did.  Oh, hang up.  Why do you think we picked that mall, you idiot?  There's a bunch of crappy malls we could have picked.  If you go to King's Plaza in Brooklyn, they wouldn't notice. 
[02:01:00]  All of a sudden, they're pulling people going, hey, come with us.  We're supposed to help you shop.  I'm not homeless.  There would be the upper echelon of the clientele.  See, homeless shopping spree.  See, you go to a hoity-toity mall.  That's what makes it so outrageous.  Right.  Let's go to Steve in Brooklyn.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Steve.  Hey.  Listen, Anthony, I just warn you now, all these Syrian Jews that are going to be out  there, it's going to be ten times worse than the people pointing at your house.  But you have to go to the Ralph Lauren Purple Label store first. 
[02:01:30]  That's what I suggest.  At Short Hills, what is in there?  It's a prestigious Ralph Lauren store that sells Purple Label only.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, spread the word.  It's happening at Short Hills Mall 2 to 6 this Saturday.  The homeless shopping spree.  It will be live on the radio in New York, Philly, and Boston.  One more call, then we move on here.  Abe from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Listen, I'm really happy you guys are doing the Short Hills Mall again. 
[02:02:00]  I missed the last one.  And just a correction, because they're so yucky, it's at the mall at Short Hills.  Yes.  And I'm going to be there.  I'm probably going to give one of those guys a pair of sunglasses or a pair of glasses.  I'm going to help them shop a little bit.  Well, Andrew.  I'll shop for you there, guys.  Andrew, the cake homeless guy there, he needs glasses.  Prescription glasses.  Prescription glasses.  And we're going to give him wacky frames, we've decided, right?  Yeah.  All right, getting back to Obama.  This is pretty cool.  So he's got the crazy name, Barack Hussein Obama. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, boy.  And this country is dumb.  Yeah, you know, like, it's enough just to be a black guy running for president.  Very difficult.  But your name better be, it better sound like an airline pilot name.  You know what I mean?  Don't you feel confident when the pilot comes on and says, you know, this is your pilot speaking,  you know, Benjamin Roger Johnson?  Just something very American sounding.  Chet Walker?  Yeah, Chet Walker. 
[02:03:00]  Chuck Yeager.  That's who I want.  Something like that.  Yeah.  But Barack Obama?  You wouldn't want that, like, as your pilot.  You wouldn't want that as the pilot of your plane.  Never mind the president.  Hello, it's your pilot, Barack Hussein Obama.  When do we get...  Oh, boy, get me off.  All right, how about this?  When do we get a black president?  When do we get a...  When he gets a better name?  When do we get a female president?  When they're conservative, like Condoleezza Rice, or they'll be vice president.  A black female president? 
[02:03:30]  Well, yeah, why not?  Or she's very...  People love her.  Well, how about...  So why can't they love Obama for being a black guy?  He's a liberal Democrat.  So you're not going to get a crossover vote.  You're not going to get conservatives to vote for a liberal Democrat.  But you will get a lot of black people, I don't care what they say, to vote for a black president, if he's a conservative even.  They will cross party lines for that, I think so.  All right.  Look at Alan Keyes.  Maybe not him with that awful white man's voice, but I mean, you know.  Do we have a female president or a black president first?  I don't know.  Brevy has a shot now. 
[02:04:00]  I think...  Female before black, unfortunately.  Hold on, let me just...  Hold on.  I swung and missed so hard on that one.  Let me just get my back back.  Oof.  That's a tough question.  Anthony's hair actually fluttered.  Yeah.  From the swing and the miss.  Good Lord.  That's a tough one.  Whoa.  All right.  Well, this is kind of interesting.  Radio host Chip Franklin, got to give him props.  He went on the streets to talk about his name. 
[02:04:30]  With people.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  His own name, Chip, a grown man?  Chip Franklin.  That's embarrassing.  It's awful.  The Obama-Osama similarity led WBAL radio talk show.  Host Chip Franklin.  I thought that was Chip.  Sound like a girl.  Do you think Barack Obama opposes a threat to the United States?  Sure.  How so?  Um, he's still out there.  He's still plotting.  Still plotting?  Do you think Barack Obama opposes a threat to the United States?  Oh, definitely.  Of course.  Now, what country do you think Barack Obama could be president of? 
[02:05:00]  Nigeria, Sudan, France, or the United States?  Nigeria.  He could have a problem with that.  I'd change my name.  Political consultants say it's too late for that.  Too late to switch to, say, his childhood nickname, Barry.  I love Barry.  You might want to keep Barry if you're going into politics in the United States.  Barry.  Wow.  That was a bad decision, huh?  How about Earl Douglas? 
[02:05:30]  Too radical.  Too radical?  Yes.  Well, let's hear from Obama here.  When a Republican operative seemed to go out of his way on MSNBC to use Obama's full name...  Barack Hussein Obama.  ...Obama supporters thought Ed Rogers did it on purpose, though Rogers later denied he was trying to tie Hussein to Saddam.  Add to all this that Barack rhymes with Iraq.  Barack still, Obama's not swearing with the American people.  Oh, my God.  Her name should be Bunt.  That's...  That's...  Julie... 
[02:06:00]  She stinks.  ...Mows around her.  She sucks.  And even if the guy is...  Like, he probably is using Hussein just to kind of tie it in.  It's kind of a...  You know what?  Oh, yeah.  Too bad.  That's the guy's name.  That's the guy's name, though.  It's not like he threw it in there and it's not his name.  Yeah.  Then you would throw in something like, you know, Hitler.  Something a little more.  You think Democrats aren't tossing Bush around with every Republican candidate who's running now?  Something about tying him into, you know, the stupid Bush?  Yeah.  With Iraq, still, Obama's not sweating it.  The American people are not concerned about middle names. 
[02:06:30]  Barack Obama what?  Is he a threat to the U.S.?  I believe he's a threat.  We need more security.  Against Barack Obama.  Of course.  Osama's on the run.  Obama's considering one.  Jeannie Moe, CNN, New York.  I get it.  Her phony voice.  She should not be allowed to talk until she talks in her real voice.  See, I think that name, though, is going to be a real problem. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  It's a problem.  I hate to say it, but you're right.  It's branding.  It's like everything else in this country.  It's branding.  You're going to buy Coca-Cola.  You're not going to buy...  Excuse me.  I'm going to change this real quick.  You're not going to buy Coca-Cola.  Oh, God.  Did they even make that?  I think they discontinued it back in the 1800s.  It was popular for a while.  Cigars and Scotch.  One of the bottle examiners. 
[02:07:30]  The problem with him isn't his name.  The problem is that the center is a...  He's using his own sound effects.  Let's get a call in Pennsylvania.  Call.  Yeah, what's going on, ONA?  How you doing?  Pretty good today, Cole.  Just made me laugh to myself.  It seems like the only black person I'll ever see will probably be on the TV show 24.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, it worked for TV.  Yeah.  All right, ONA, you rock. 
[02:08:00]  All right, thank you.  And notice the country's in constant turmoil on 24.  I just heard it.  It was on the brink.  It's just for a day.  You got to remember that.  That's true.  It's just a day.  One lousy day.  He had one bad day.  One day.  Salty Giblets, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, it's never that day where he's got, like, the runs all day long.  And, like, he's just...  Jack Bauer has to keep hitting the can all day.  Like, one of those bad, percolating stomach.  It hurts in your thighs. 
[02:08:30]  Kind of days.  Next 24, again, he's just running to the can.  Why hasn't SNL done that?  I know.  That's a bit...  Yeah.  It's ready for SNL.  It's a little hacky, but, I mean, it's kind of realistic.  Have you seen SNL?  Yeah, have some of those days.  Salty Giblets, what's up?  So, what's up, guys?  Look, I think that this might work out for him.  Because think about it.  What's worse in this country to get hired as a president for, being black or having that name?  So, I think everyone's going to get distracted.  I don't think people are ready for a black president yet.  They're going to take their attention off that. 
[02:09:00]  Think about his name.  Do you think we'd vote for a white guy with the same name?  Yes, absolutely.  With the same qualifications that Obama has?  Yeah, now everyone's confused.  But you actually think we would?  I still don't think the guy would win.  Same qualifications as Obama, which are kind of limited.  He really isn't very experienced.  People just like the fact that he's a great speaker.  And his name is actually helping him because it's so recognizable.  It's getting him recognized.  People are like, oh yeah, people just know that name.  I mean, he's not a very... 
[02:09:30]  He's a big fish in a small pond is what it is.  There aren't many black politicians that cross over as well as he does.  He crosses over to the white population very well because he doesn't just blindly take over these black causes that really should maybe be looked into a little more.  Things like that.  He's not one of these like Al Sharpton, you know, where white people just look and the second he opens his mouth, we don't care what he's saying.  It must be wrong because he's always going off. 
[02:10:00]  I was going to say uppity.  Yeah, well.  But I decided against it.  All right.  We don't have time to start anything new right now.  So we should wrap up.  There are a lot of people just kind of waking up in the last hour.  We announced that the homeless shopping spree will be at the mall at Short Hills.  We call it the Short Hills Mall.  A hurl.  It's a hoity-toity mall.  We did it back in the day at Short Hills Mall.  It worked out perfectly.  We're going back there.  It's a class joint. 
[02:10:30]  We're hoping a lot of listeners show up to help the homeless shop this Saturday from 2 to 6 p.m.  We'll broadcast the whole thing live on the radio here in New York City, in Philly, and in Boston.  And for the radio stations that don't pick up the show live, shame on you first of all.  Shame.  Shame, shame, shame.  Shame, shame, shame.  Shame, shame on you first of all.  Let me ask you a question.  They call it the mall at Short Hills, the pompous asses?  We love them.  They're having us.  Oh, yeah.  I understand. 
[02:11:00]  Anytime you say something is the something at the something, you're a pompous bloke.  Yes, at.  Absolutely.  But if you don't get to hear the show live, they will rebroadcast it on Monday when you  usually listen to the Opie and Anthony show up.  Because we're on a lot of different times all over the country.  You're a tranny at the meat market.  But please don't be confused.  It's not a meat market.  It's the meat packing district.  Meat packing.  Why did I say meat market?  Because you're inexperienced.  I'll take you for a spin.  Maybe it's a Freudian slip.  But don't be confused. 
[02:11:30]  Saturday, we are live on the radio.  Yes.  From 2 to 6 p.m.  And your job, if you're in the area, go to the mall and check out the home of shopping  or check out the show.  Whatever.  Whatever you want to do.  Okay?  But all we ask is you behave.  Because even last year when we were only on XM, I think we had like 1,000 people show up.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of people.  Close to 1,000 anyway.  I don't know.  I don't know the exact number.  I don't want to exaggerate.  But it was a lot of people last year.  10,000.  I predict a couple thousand people easily at the Short Hills Mall on Saturday. 
[02:12:00]  So spread the word.  Get the details out there for us, please.  And all the info is up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  Right.  All right, guys.  Hey, we had a lot of fun today.  We appreciate it.  We'll have more info, I guess, on our TV commercial that is done and ready to go.  Can't wait.  Yes.  In the coming days.  I don't know if it's going to be on TV in the next day or two.  We're trying to get it on the internet like later on this afternoon.  Get the info from Elo.  Yeah, we'll figure it all out.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  See you tomorrow. 
[02:12:30]  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:13:00]  Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.  We on?  Yeah, we're on.  Yeah, we're on.  We're on.  Outside 3FM on the street with some fine, fine listeners.  Listeners.  and a photographer from Boston Magazine that distracted us all morning long.  Not too distracting having a camera in your face because you're trying to do a broadcast.  Yeah, now they're going to photograph the walkover.  Yeah.  Could somebody hold this?  I'm not sure if they're going to have to blank out Canada Dry. 
[02:13:30]  So, yeah, thank you.  Thank you, Danny.  Photo op for everybody.  This is going to be in Boston Magazine.  So, you know, pull out your penises and wave them to the camera as we walk down the sidewalk here.  All right, we're uncensored.  I can't even put up my ridiculous keep-my-head-warm hood because they're snapping pictures.  Should we walk in formation so they get a good shot of us walking on the streets and talking?  Let's do things with our hands. 
[02:14:00]  Be animated, even though it's still pictures.  You could kind of...  You guys should just goose-step down the street.  You almost tripped.  Ah, I made you.  Should we just do that?  What?  We'll just goose-step.  Yeah, we'll goose-step.  Somebody's father won't be happy.  Goose-stepping down the sidewalk.  Take this shot.  Did you get a couple?  Yes, I did.  After you said that.  Oh, look.  Computer monitor out on the street.  Yeah, one man's trash. 
[02:14:30]  Not too awkward.  Why don't you get way down there and we'll walk toward you or something?  It looks wide awake.  He's doing a good job.  He's just walking backwards.  Photographers have to walk backwards a lot.  That sucks.  So we're here on the streets of New York.  Look, I'm going to point at buildings, make them believe.  Look, we're broadcasting.  We're doing this and that.  Now you do something, Anthony.  And the other thing.  I was pointing at buildings.  Like, it was so interesting to be out here today broadcasting.  Yeah, Steve.  Well, it's going to be...  Want me to read?  It's going to be Sam and Anthony on the... 
[02:15:00]  Go fuck yourself.  It's going to be Sam and Anthony on the cover of Boston Magazine because Sam is just walking  in front of me.  Sam.  I'll read this.  I wanted a picture with her camera.  Jimmy's going to read.  Yeah.  Sponsoring the walkover.  Oh, that's right.  Natrol.  Yeah.  Primary talking points.  Natrol really boosts energy, man.  Got zero calories, zero fat, zero sugar.  It's available in strawberry and orange flavors.  I think a lot of people like orange and some people prefer strawberry. 
[02:15:30]  Strawberry.  It does contain B vitamins.  Of course, there's some caffeine and some taurine.  I don't know what that means.  And, you know...  Oh, secondary talking points.  Ah.  It contains secondary talking points.  Secondary talking points.  Nice.  Oh, you want to move before you get killed by the bus?  Oh, that would suck.  We just saved the photographer from getting run over by a bus.  If she was fat, I would have let it happen.  And, you know, you just break the tablet on the score and drop it in the water.  Yeah.  Bottle for a delicious fruit-flavored energy drink.  Good old fruit.  Let's walk this way. 
[02:16:00]  Trick her.  She's pulling this one.  Hey.  Hey.  Wait.  I didn't finish my name.  Hey, traffic lady.  Hey, can I make a right turn here later?  Can I make a right turn here later?  It depends.  I'm going to...  It depends.  I'm going to do it anyway.  Oh, look at her.  Shouldn't you be fucking carrying Naomi Watts?  No.  All right.  Contains about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  And the interesting thing about Natrol, it's available for purchase at Walgreens.  Oh.  Walgreens.  Hey, why don't we...  Here's your photo op, lady. 
[02:16:30]  Uh-oh.  See, it's a newsstand.  Yeah.  But they sell...  Yeah.  So, we'll make believe we're doing...  Like, we're talking for everybody here.  This is going to be the shot they use right here.  So, yeah.  We're on the streets in New York.  We're talking to you, Boston.  And...  That's right.  See, there.  Is that a good shot?  All right.  That's a good one.  Go home.  All right.  We got to go.  Let's cross the street.  No, she's been very nice the whole time.  Yeah.  You could...  Yeah, you could keep... 
[02:17:00]  Don't pay attention to him.  He's being...  He's being mean.  But only to the front door.  Then I'm sorry you can't come.  Is she done?  I don't know.  She's still snapping.  It wasn't really anything...  She gave up.  Did she?  Yeah, good.  It wasn't really...  You told her to leave.  Good for you.  Now leave.  Now leave.  Beat it, stupid. 
[02:17:30]  You're not welcome.  Take that Leno cock blocker with you.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  It's not that cold out today.  Nah, it's a little chilly.  Not that anyone cares.  Not warm.  Thank God Taylor Hicks' new album is coming out.  I know.  Something to jerk off to.  Oh.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Look at this fucking enchantress. 
[02:18:00]  Oh my goodness.  You guys are out-of-towners, man.  Can you tell these guys are out-of-towners or what?  Yeah, they're smiling.  Where are you from?  South Jersey.  South Jersey?  Oh, it's not really out-of-town.  Kind of a Philly area, sort of.  Well, actually, we're down by Combs River.  Okay.  Uh, Rivoli's?  Yeah, we're right by Rivoli's.  Yeah, it's a great place, man.  Supports the show.  Guy just opened a comedy club that, uh, he says he knows Jimmy.  He does.  Uh, what was his name?  I forget his name.  I don't remember.  From Rivoli's? 
[02:18:30]  And Paul's wife is trying to get me to do a gig there, and I'm like, I probably can't.  Only because it's close to Atlantic City.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And you can't market yourself close to, like, you just can't.  AC is a...  Well, give up AC.  See, I hear it's a fad.  But it was, I'm trying to explain this to her, and she's like, well, couldn't you just...  It's like, no, but I can't.  But wait, couldn't you just...  No, I can't just...  Yeah, why would I lie to you?  Fucking 80 times I had to explain or I couldn't.  I'm going to blow up my spot at Atlantic City.  All right.  Why don't we go upstairs?  Come on.  You guys come on up, check out the show. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, you're cordially invited.  Are you a tourist?  Where are you from?  Philly.  Philly?  All right, you can come up.  You can't come.  You have to stay out here.  I'm sorry, you can't come.  Let Fat Steve Martin come up.  All right.  You can come up.  Everyone comes up and check out the show.  Everyone comes to the new Utherance Center we're opening.  I can't get enough of Caddyshack Lines.  I love it.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  Hey.  Very good.  I like how we have the menorah and the wreath and the tree.  Everyone well represented. 
[02:19:30]  And we will see you upstairs.  O.P. and the XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  All right. 
[02:20:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwall.  Three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Yeep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Yeep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Opie.  Yeah, I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed 
[02:20:30]  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  All right, enough! 
[02:21:00]  We understand their music. 
[02:21:30]  It plays, and then they come on.  They, I mean us.  I have to get...  Jimmy's heading into the bathroom with a microphone.  Man, he got me good today, by the way.  I think the pal talkers heard all that  because they get the behind-the-scenes audio.  They heard it, and then they saw it.  Oh, you showed it to them, too?  Yeah, the pal talk camera went into the bathroom  after Jimmy defiled it. 
[02:22:00]  We like to leave surprises for each other.  When we came back from a break over there,  Jimmy was still in the bathroom,  and I was going to comment on it.  Like, wow, he must really be doing something in there,  and we got distracted, and I forgot.  So when he came out, I didn't even think about it.  And then you went in after him.  Oh, my God.  The next break, so it had been sitting there stewing.  Too massive.  In its own juices.  Too massive yule logs side by side.  Like, too thick, by the way. 
[02:22:30]  Horrible.  What the hell is going on  that he's laying logs that thick down?  Well, that's what made it hard for me.  Oh.  I haven't been making a lot of duty.  And the fact that I made such good duties,  I felt proud of.  Yeah.  Excuse me for sniffling.  Jimmy, where are you, by the way?  We have started the show.  I'm just...  I'm in the hallway.  I'm just making sure certain...  Ooh.  Certain things are...  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no. 
[02:23:00]  Hold on.  No, no.  I'm in the hallway.  Yeah.  Just in the hallway,  just doing some stuff.  Yeah.  By the way,  I do realize that we walk over to XM  and I just shit on the radio  and expect it to be entertaining.  It is.  I do love XM.  Can I say that?  Yes, you love it.  I love it very much. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  I like the sound.  It's got a nice...  It's hot.  Rice Krispie consistency to it.  Taste.  And taste.  Making your own little Rice Krispie treats.  Nothing for me today, Ken.  I need a bowl of cereal or something.  Is that possible?  Of course.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  Where's that coming from?  Can't tell with Jimmy.  In front of the back.  Where's that coming from?  That could be coming out his ass. 
[02:24:00]  No, it's not.  Everything coming out of my ass is solid.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like big cock?  No, that's what goes in.  Oh.  I don't go for that business.  When's our XM commercial showing?  I don't know, man.  Has Elo gotten in touch with us yet?  No.  Get Elo on the line.  You know what I was laughing at yesterday on the replay?  We were just talking about him being drunk.  I don't know why that made me laugh so hard.  It really is funny.  I had just yesterday gotten some pictures off of a digital camera. 
[02:24:30]  My camera.  That was in the bag.  In my bag that I take on trips with me.  And it was pictures from Letterman.  When we did Letterman.  And I found some pictures of us in Bob Eatman's hotel room.  Oh, that means it was late.  Me and Elo drinking from Bob's minibar.  Using up all of his minibar liquor. 
[02:25:00]  You've told the story so many times on the radio.  You've got to get those pictures up.  Now I'll get the pictures up.  Because there's one of Elo lounging on the couch.  But he's not even on the couch.  He's on the back of the couch like a cat.  He's just kind of lounging there with his head in his hand.  Leaning back.  Trying to look sexy.  And there's only two other men in the hotel room.  He's trying to lick his own balls.  Yeah, maybe that too.  Put his legs straight up and lick his balls. 
[02:25:30]  Wonderful.  Yeah, I've got to get those pictures up.  All right, Jimmy, what do we got?  I'm just sitting here.  That's about it?  Yeah, I'm just chit-chatting with the boys.  Just chit-chatting?  Hey, I have a question.  I have a curiosity.  Yeah.  Does anybody know if we have a relationship with Dell computers?  Hmm.  Actually, I think XM does a lot of work with Dell computers.  I'm only curious because I have a laptop that there's some issues with.  And I have an aluminum baseball bat.  Oh, no. 
[02:26:00]  I'm close to making an introduction.  Oh, that frustrated, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to bite my lips off.  I almost cried yesterday on the phone.  The hours of my time that have just, I'll never get back those hours.  It really can bring a grown man just about to tears, if not to tears, being on the phone  with some of those customer no-service people.  Oh.  Yes, please.  Press one, two. 
[02:26:30]  That sounded good.  These all sound like corks, though.  They don't sound like the main, you know, the main load.  No, these are all backed up.  I've been backed up.  I think those almonds yesterday really helped me.  But you did two really big logs over there at CBS.  I made two big duties.  I feel like a lot of people are so shy about their bathroom habits, and here I am shitting  in front of two countries.  I'm kind of good about that.  And, uh, on the internet, so, you know, the world. 
[02:27:00]  You're shitting for the planet and beyond.  The whole globe.  I was talking to this person on this stupid helpline.  I think his name was, um...  Oh, my God.  Oh, that sounded like soft serve.  But he said Ralph.  That's a damn that broke.  That sounded like something you want sprinkles on.  You guys do your thing.  I'm going to mind my business.  Yeah, yeah.  Just mind your business.  That's fine. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Well, the Golden Globe nominations were announced.  Does anyone care about this stuff?  Jim can give his opinion on some of the nominations, I'm sure.  Nominees for Best Drama.  Drama.  How do you say that?  Babel.  Babel.  Babel.  Babel.  Babel.  B-A-B-E-L.  Babel.  Nominee for Best Drama.  Babel.  Bobby, which got horrendous reviews.  What was Bobby?  I know what Babel is.  Bobby Kennedy. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, right.  The Departed.  I liked it.  Thought it was good.  Yes, The Departed.  Little Children didn't see it.  And The Queen.  Did you ever see The Departed?  Were you able to...  Did that...  I, um...  I'm going to watch it on the way to L.A. when we do Jay Leno.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I was just wondering if that worked out for you.  Yeah, they're going to give me a special screening.  Yeah.  When I fly out to L.A.  That's nice of them.  My pal Anthony to do Jay Leno a week from tonight, by the way. 
[02:28:30]  I did like The Departed, but I thought it was overrated.  Overrated as far as...  Because you're basing it on the Scorsese scale?  Yeah.  Like, at first I was like, I hope he wins an Oscar, but this year he should not win for  that.  Um, what do you think was overrated about it, Jimmy?  I'm interested.  I'll say the second half of it I thought was great, and there were some great things I  didn't expect.  Yeah.  But the first part of it was good, but not great.  I didn't think it was bad.  Good, but not great.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I might actually agree with you on that.  Nominees for Best Comedy or Musical?  Dan, no. 
[02:29:00]  Comedy or Musical?  Uh, Borat.  Borat.  Which was hilarious.  The Devil Wears Prada.  Ugh.  What?  Ducky.  Dream Girls.  Dream Girls is a comedy?  Little Miss Sunshine, which I thought was hilarious.  I didn't think that was a comedy much either.  Little Miss Sunshine?  That tragic little fucking movie.  It was a black comedy, my friend.  Black comedy.  Show me the comedy.  It was hilarious.  And then Thank You for Smoking was really funny as well.  Yeah.  Thank You for Smoking.  I enjoyed a lot. 
[02:29:30]  I think that.  Golden Globes will probably give it to Borat.  No.  Because Golden Globes isn't as stuffy as the Academy Awards.  Little Miss Sunshine will get Best Comedy.  I see the Academy Awards giving it something like Little Miss Sunshine, but not the Golden  Globes are like the People's Choice Awards.  It's really just a load of shit.  There's no way they give it to Borat.  Cue the shit, Jimmy.  That would have been perfect.  I know.  I was trying for one of those moments, but...  I'm doing Pilates right now.  My core is being strengthened.  Core. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, guess what?  Brother listens in Iraq, so Jim, you're shitting for soldiers too.  All right, Jimmy.  You are shitting for America.  I'm making insurgents.  Oh, wow.  Bombs away.  He's got a pin-up girl tattooed on his ass cheek like a bomber.  Nothing.  Nah, shit.  My World War II jokes stink today.  He's just making Iraqi soldiers.  Just give him a gun and get him out in the field.  Nominees for Best Actor in a Drama. 
[02:30:30]  Leonardo DiCaprio for Blood Diamond.  Anyone see that?  And The Departed.  He got two nominees.  What?  Wow, greedy.  Peter O'Toole got a nomination for Venus.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Will Smith for The Pursuit of Happiness, which is getting three stars in the New York papers today.  I say Forrest Whitaker takes it for The Last King of Scotland.  Oh, absolutely.  Even though I haven't seen it, they just rave about his performance in The Last King of Scotland.  My favorite character Forrest Whitaker played?  Come on.  Fast times. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  He was the football hero.  Right.  I preferred him in Platoon.  What was his name in that?  I liked him in Good Morning Vietnam.  Jefferson, by the way, I think was his name in that.  Yeah.  Correct?  Jefferson, yeah.  Jefferson for Earth, Wind, and Fire, and Little Brother.  The nominees for Best Actress in a Drama.  Penelope Cruz in Volver.  Volvo.  Volver.  Volver.  It says Volver.  Volver.  Judy Dench.  No. 
[02:31:30]  Dame.  Judy Dench.  Dame Judy Dench.  Notes on a Scandal.  Ugh.  If that doesn't say period piece.  Notes on a Scandal.  Helen Mirren.  Best Wardrobe.  Notes on a Scandal.  Maggie Gyllenhaal.  For Sherry Baby.  Sherry Baby.  Helen Mirren.  For the Queen.  She wins that.  Yeah.  And Kate Winslet for Little Children.  Remember her in Titanic.  Thank you.  She was wonderful. 
[02:32:00]  I'm starting to realize I haven't seen many movies this year.  No.  I haven't seen half these.  Best Actor.  Flex.  In a comedy.  Or musical.  Sasha.  Oh, that's why it was in there.  Baby.  Dreamgirls is a musical.  Sasha.  Coen for Borat.  Johnny Depp for Pirates of the Caribbean.  Aaron Eckert for Thank You for Smoking.  What is this guy?  Chiwetel AGO4.  Is he running for office?  Wow.  Is he running for president?  Wow. 
[02:32:30]  For Kinky Boots.  And Will Ferrell for Stranger Than Fiction.  Well, I've only seen two of those movies.  I will give it to Borat.  Borat?  I'm just saying Borat's going to run away with it.  All right.  I have no idea.  The nominees for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical are Annette Bening, Running with Scissors,  Toni Collette, Little Miss Sunshine.  We spoke to her.  Toni Collette?  Yeah.  She came in.  Oh, yeah.  She sat there and was Australian. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Beyonce for Dreamgirls, Meryl Streep for The Devil Wears Prada, and Renee Zellweger.  Zellweger.  You don't like Renee Zellweger?  I hate her name.  It sounds like something else.  Oh.  What does it sound like, Jimmy?  You smell something.  Yeah.  For Miss Potter.  Miss Potter.  The nominees for Best Director.  That's a lot of work.  Clint Eastwood for Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  Uh, Stephen Frears for The Queen. 
[02:33:30]  Alejandro Gonzalez in Ritu for Babble.  Babble.  And Martin Scorsese for The Departed.  Yeah.  Uh, nominees for Best Supporting Actor.  You got Ben Affleck for Hollywoodland.  Yeah.  Eddie Murphy for Dreamgirls.  Jack Nicholson for The Departed.  Brad Pitt for Babble.  And, you got a rain stick in there?  Some rain.  Uh, and Mark Wahlberg for, for, uh, The Departed. 
[02:34:00]  How the fuck did he get nominated for that?  Mark Wahlberg?  He was decent at best.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Supporting Mark Wahlberg.  Animated film, Cars, Happy Feet, and Monster House.  Starring Stephen Carr.  I don't know.  And then Happy Feet.  And then no one cares about the...  Best Supporting Actor.  It just goes on and on.  I wanted to look into the best foreign documentary.  All right.  Eddie Murphy's in Dreamgirls? 
[02:34:30]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what they did with that Dreamgirls movie?  Huh?  They opened it up at, like, the Ziegfeld here, and it was 25...  Was it more than that?  25.  25 bucks a ticket.  What?  To get in.  Why?  And they give you, like, a booklet.  Because they were trying to present it like the old-time movies, where it cost a lot,  and it was exclusive in one theater, and it was, like, a night out, and you get a program  when you walk in.  Like, you're going to see a live show, and you're just sitting there watching a fucking  movie.  And then people, like, get up and clap at the end.  Ugh. 
[02:35:00]  Like, the fucking projector guy is gonna bow.  All right.  Can I ask before we move on, how did Mark Wahlberg...  I didn't see The Departs.  I'm out of this.  He stuck in it?  No, no, no.  He didn't stop.  He didn't stop.  He was good, but good at...  There was one scene he was doing.  To me, the best thing in that was fucking Martin Sheen, who absolutely should have been  nominated over Mark Wahlberg.  And I was watching a scene they were doing with Martin Sheen, DiCaprio, and Wahlberg.  Yeah.  And when you see, like, how good...  I mean, DiCaprio's been annoying me, but he's a really good actor. 
[02:35:30]  But Martin Sheen is...  You know what Martin Sheen does?  He takes a fucking regular guy and just makes him amazingly interesting.  Martin Sheen...  Yeah.  Far and away was the best thing in that film.  Maybe he wasn't big enough to have gotten a nomination as far as his part.  But watch the scene.  This is a scene in the office where Mark Wahlberg does a nice job, but as actors, man, you're  watching an actor, and then you're just watching Martin Sheen be a guy.  Yeah.  He's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  And a credit to Martin Sheen, I can't stand him as a human being.  No.  But as an actor, yes. 
[02:36:00]  I think he's very good.  But he doesn't bother me, because he's been getting arrested for the cause for 25 years.  I mean, it's just what he does.  He did it before it was fashionable.  Hey, is Roland here?  Handcuffing himself to a nuclear missile silo.  We get it.  He's sincere, though, man.  He's not a...  He's not...  He's sincerely an idiot.  But he's not a guy that's just showboating for a press op, like a photo op.  He's like, that's the reason the real deal.  How about you unchain yourself from the fucking missile, and you go and make sure your son  isn't fucking doing drugs.  How about you be a father? 
[02:36:30]  How about you do that?  How great is Wall Street?  I don't judge a man by the size of his wallet!  That movie's fantastic.  That fucking guy just ran circles around everyone there, too.  All right, can we take a break?  I want a kiss.  And we're going to try to find Roland.  See who he wants to win.  Yeah.  Roland.  Also, something we started, we're going to kind of do a little cleanup today.  Teens having sex in movie theaters.  We only played one out of the five clips, and there's some great stuff on here.  How did we not play every clip of teens having sex? 
[02:37:00]  And we're talking about movies, so this is perfect for today.  Also, we got the Star Wars holiday special.  We want to try to get to.  Oh, great.  Oh, God, that one that Lucas shot?  We never got to it.  It is so completely bad, and it was back in the news because some guy asked a question  about it at some event that Lucas and one of Lucas' cronies was at.  Like, one of his second-in-command asked him a question about if, since they're releasing  so many Star Wars DVDs lately, if they're going to release this Christmas special, and 
[02:37:30]  the guy just got pissed and looked at him and he goes, no, you won't be seeing that.  And the guy was summarily removed from the event for even bringing up this thing.  Oh, come on.  Apparently, rumor has it, and it's not just rumor.  I think it's fact.  Lucas had every print of that thing burned, just destroyed, but it had gotten out before  beforehand, and now you could get it at conventions and whatnot, and it's so utterly  bad.  Yeah, it was on YouTube and pulled off. 
[02:38:00]  For like an hour?  But he tried to actually destroy every copy of it ever made.  Instead of just being, instead of realizing you have a multi-billion dollar franchise.  Empire.  And just laughing at yourself for a bad effort, you fucking, ugh, enough with Lucas and his  fucking faggity little elf.  Wack, wack, wack, wack, wack, wack, wack.  Oh, look, it's the chickadee monster.  Douchebag.  Stop fucking marketing for children.  God, you get so angry.  It's hilarious.  It bugs me, dude.  He's fucking.  The Ewok. 
[02:38:30]  You have a billion dollar empire.  But your anger goes really to a place.  I know, but my girlfriend always says that, too.  Every time we argue, she's like, it's so fatalistic with you.  It's amazing.  It's like, everything goes to the end of the relationship, and I know it does.  I've said it before, though.  I've listened back to the replays and said to myself on the air, I talked to the radio,  what are you so pissed at?  Yeah.  Why am I, because I'm yelling about something, like at a movie, or something just in name  that wouldn't bother me worth a shit if I'm just sitting on the couch. 
[02:39:00]  But it might as well be like we're under nuclear attack the way I'm yelling.  When I listen to the replays, I think, wow, you really are a dope.  We all have our crosses to bear.  Exactly.  Emotional wrecks.  You're a babbling idiot.  Who do you think that about, though?  Myself.  Oh, absolutely.  You're just a dope.  E-Rock?  Where is fucking E-Rock?  I'm like cruising a wrestling site online. 
[02:39:30]  Ew, his arms are muscular.  Posters on his walls of half-naked men.  These are awful.  I'm sure he's ready to come running in to point at something to distract us.  What?  No, look, Al said yesterday.  Did he?  That could have waited is what I'm getting at.  I could see him whenever we talk about him, and he just slowly shakes his head like,  ah, the children are at it again.  He does with his pseudo mullet.  I'm going to go out there and just kiss the back of his neck under his hairline. 
[02:40:00]  By the way, I want my new hairdo.  What's going to be your new hairdo?  I have one of two options.  Either the one I already sported or the opposite way.  Because your hair is getting very long now.  It's getting cut today, hippie.  Dude, give yourself a horseshoe to see what it would look like.  Okay.  Oh, that would be so funny.  Give yourself a horseshoe.  The father from Mark and Mindy horseshoe.  Can we do it today?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  All right.  Let's get the clippers.  I got the clippers.  It's time for a new hairdo.  Snap a line on this so it looks nice and even and not like, you know, chemo. 
[02:40:30]  We want it to look like he has the horseshoe balding pattern.  Just like Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy from time to time will give us a new hairdo, and it's just wonderful for everybody.  And then we put the picture up on opianthony.com.  We asked for the listeners' new hairdos, but they're too chicken.  Yeah, they're chicken.  Buck, buck, buck, buck.  Everybody's afraid.  Get your new hairdos.  You want to look attractive.  Yeah.  All right.  Today, we give Jimmy a new hairdo. 
[02:41:00]  There's the clippers.  We'll take a break, and we'll give you a new hairdo next.  Ooh, I hope we have something to cover me so I don't get hair on my neck.  Oh, yeah.  Like a barber shop.  The barber shop.  Yeah.  Don't remind Jimmy of that.  And then...  Of what?  Nothing, because then you won't get your hair cut.  Like he cares.  Is it that picture of me, my old hairdo?  No.  No.  I'm not saying it.  Look, they got a rope for you and everything.  Look at that, a robe.  It's a Robert Reed lavender fucking robe.  Look at that.  That's fucking Stephen Carr's New Year's Eve outfit. 
[02:41:30]  What, are you going to go chase a comet?  What the fuck?  That is an awful purple fucking robe.  I saw the sign.  Did we have that?  I got to hear that again.  Stephen Carr.  I saw the sign.  Sings, I saw the signs.  Soins.  I love that version that she does.  That was great, dude.  It is so out there.  We need that on our...  I saw the signs. 
[02:42:00]  We need the hook on our instant...  Just whining.  ...on our instant replay.  Can someone remember that, please?  Yeah, please play that again.  Yeah, this is from our character contest.  Can't get enough of it.  This is I Saw the Sign.  Did she win?  Yeah.  I think we ended up getting one.  I should have.  Yeah, she did.  All right.  We go to break with this.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm your person.  I'm here with you. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, did it bother?  Oh, you're not the one for me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Is it not enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong. 
[02:43:00]  Where do you belong?  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.  Perhaps I'll belly up to the old bar and request a libation.  Ramon, fetch me a bikini teeny.  And then push in my stool.  10-202.  The virus. 
[02:43:30]  Cement infected.  Somebody wants to give me a present?  Ooh.  A present?  Ooh.  Hey, uh, Rick. 
[02:44:00]  Rick, from the Apple Store.  I'm not going to be out on Long Island before Christmas, so why don't you mail it to me here  at XM Satellite Radio.  I like presents.  Wow.  I like presents, too, but I probably already have three.  I like to be in the presents.  Someone call Rick off the instant feedback and give him the mailing address.  And tell him I'll stop in and say hi the next time I'm out on Long Island. 
[02:44:30]  Wow.  Yes, Jimmy, what happened?  I heard some screaming from the office.  Lucas, I just spent the last, say, six minutes in the office watching a copy of the Star Wars  holiday special.  Again, if I've seen it, I was fucking eight when it came out.  I don't remember it.  Yeah.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to include scat videos and animal fucking.  It's the least entertaining thing I've ever seen.  Ever.  And it's so great to me because somebody had to approve this. 
[02:45:00]  They watched this.  Like, Lucas did this.  Yep.  And they watched it, and it's got the fucking, the little fluffy try-to-market-them characters,  which is why I hate him, by the way.  The little baby Chewbacca's little son.  His son.  His fucking cunt of a wife and his fucking old man father.  Old mangy father.  And the first four minutes, there's a Han Solo introduction with Chewie, and then there's  fucking four minutes of just Chewbacca family noise. 
[02:45:30]  Grunting.  Just.  Four minutes straight.  And the father, the daughter, bring home her boyfriend, the father's, you know.  And then, like, they're throwing in stock footage from the movie of Imperial Cruisers, and then  they put Han Solo and Chewbacca in this poorly made set of the flight deck of the Falcon, and 
[02:46:00]  it just looks really bad.  And they all, I guess, Lucas had to have somehow, I'm thinking, blackmailed them into doing that.  Like, why would they do that?  Because it was probably, at the time, when was that done?  Oh, it was right after the first one.  1998.  Okay.  Oh, 98.  That was explained.  Because Mark Hamill has prostate cancer in it. 
[02:46:30]  And, you know what it is?  It probably was before the second one.  They were like, let's ride the success out.  Yeah.  They didn't know they had an empire in the hands.  Guys, you want to do that?  Yeah, you know, I wasn't even thinking that.  They really weren't anybody back then.  Yes.  All of them.  78.  They're just agreeing to do anything.  And it is so incredibly bad.  The special guest's in it.  And did you see the very beginning where they go, it's the Star Wars Christmas special.  Like, every announcer in the 70s had to yell during the intro to these things. 
[02:47:00]  With special guest, Bea Arthur.  No, Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice Arthur.  She's in it.  Yeah.  Jefferson Starship.  No shit.  Art Carney.  Art Carney is in it.  Hey there, chewy boy.  What about C-3PO, Hawk and Toys after the Christmas?  Oh, I don't remember that.  I didn't see that.  There's like toy commercials.  There's the actual commercials that played during it too. 
[02:47:30]  I have to get it.  So that's kind of cool and nostalgic to look at.  You know, I think there's I Can't Believe I Eat the Whole Thing or some Legs Pantyhose or  some stupid thing.  I can't believe it.  We got short shorts.  One of those.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  You know, with the chicks walking down the stairs.  Yeah.  We got short shorts.  It's Heather Mills' version.  Do you want to hit it?  There's that short short.  We hear you.  We've got short shorts.  Great.  Use narrative.  Fix your twats.  Use it on that 70s fucking muff.  Your pubis isn't fucking blowing hair out the sides of your legs. 
[02:48:00]  Your fucking, your fucking mons, mons, whatever it's called.  Mons Venus.  Mons Venus.  Your labia majora.  Is not fucking poofing hair out, you fucking 70s chimp.  There's that short short.  We know.  You want to hear the opening scene with Han and Chewbacca?  Dude, I want to hear the, when they introduce the fucking people playing and they have Chewbacca's  family's names.  Yeah.  I almost bit Sam's ear. 
[02:48:30]  Do we have the opening credits?  Hmm?  Not on that CD.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, it better be one second.  I say a half a second, man.  You're too generous.  A half, a quarter.  All right.  Get it in a quarter second.  All right.  In the meantime, we got this.  All right.  Thank you.  I can't get enough of her.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm new.  I want everybody singing the hook at home, by the way.  Make sure you sing. 
[02:49:00]  Don't ruin it here.  I want to hear her.  I'm watching you on Pal Talk.  Sing the hook.  And then she tries to get all sexy at the end. 
[02:49:30]  And then they have to go, I saw the swines.  Wind is blowing.  It's like she's on the fucking, the wing of that fucking Virgin Airline to try to land.  Holy shit.  She's all nervous.  Popping her peas, breathing heavily into that shitty mic.  I just can't get enough of that, though.  I saw the swine.  All right.  We can do the opening scene as we get that other piece of audio.  It is fucking bad.  We'll start here, and then we'll go backwards when we get it. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, it's so bad.  Opening scene with Hans.  No, this is going forward.  This is correct.  This is the right order.  That was, Hans' scene was first.  No, I understand, but we want to get audio, the intro of the whole show we don't have yet.  Right.  Oh, okay.  I thought that came after.  I thought this was a cold open.  Oh, okay.  Is it?  I could be wrong, but I just wanted to throw a show up as a camera.  It's got to be in chronological order.  So far, I think I saw the Han solo first, then the intro came after it.  Here's Han and Chewbacca.  That's it.  I'm turning back.  I know your family's waiting. 
[02:50:30]  I know it's an important day.  All right.  We'll give it a try.  That's such important.  You won't jump, Bob.  No.  I'll get you back there in time, pal.  Trust me.  Our only hope now is I'll run that Imperial Garbage Scout, though.  I'm going to Lightspeed.  That's just spirit.  You'll be celebrating life day before you know it.  Stand by. 
[02:51:00]  Here's for a second.  Bye-bye.  We're our chosen friends.  Oh, what?  I don't know, but I know I should have heard someone say weak-chinned idiot to describe the  fucking director.  Yeah.  Dude, it's fucking life day.  And hence life day.  Zachy.  What does that even mean?  Life day I'm so glad I'm new present.  Life is really new.  I don't bother. 
[02:51:30]  You're not the one for me.  There's enough, enough.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  You get into the lights where you belong.  I'm here to you belong. 
[02:52:00]  She starts going breathy on us.  It gets funnier every time you hear it.  All right, back to the Star Wars Holiday Special.  And thank you to whoever got me my plain fat-free yogurt that is vanilla-flavored.  Oh.  Here's the two minutes of Wookiees.  Of the Wookiees talking.  Oh, God.  Dude.  If you don't want to fucking cave somebody's head in.  What happened?  What? 
[02:52:30]  What's going on?  I was still doing.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Who called you to come in?  Why?  Eric, why?  Ask Eric, why?  Give me the yogurt.  Eric.  Who?  What?  Who decided that they should disrupt the show?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Of course it would be Iraq again.  Eric, do you want to just explain?  All of a sudden, this gentleman walked in.  He got your yogurt.  He got the wrong yogurt.  I sent him in to fix it, to go and get the right yogurt.  I got your yogurt. 
[02:53:00]  Iraq, while you're in here, did you get your jingle ball tickets?  Yes.  You want a jingle ball?  Yes.  Oh, you made me...  Wait, wait.  Who's playing?  Who's playing?  Give me the line.  Oh, I don't remember.  The Killers.  All right.  Evanescence.  Justin Timberlake.  Oh, okay.  That's who you're going for.  And there's three or four more.  I can't remember.  And in that three or four more lays the reason he is going.  Right.  Although, Justin Timberlake, I'm really starting to like, and I don't want to, but I can't  help it.  I have that fucking... 
[02:53:30]  What's that song about the...  I got a cock in my mouth?  No, no, no.  That's his mantra.  How could you like Justin Timberlake?  What's the one song he's got that's fucking...  I don't know.  That's just it.  Eric.  Sexy Back.  That's it.  It's good.  And what is it?  What is the gist of that song?  That he's bringing the sexy back?  Pretty much.  But it's a good song.  Thanks.  Do we have any of it, Bill?  All right.  All right, Bill.  Oh.  This is not bad. 
[02:54:00]  Contri-generic bullshit.  It's a good close song.  How many songs sound like this?  Yeah.  I like this one.  Why couldn't this just be K-Fed?  I love K-Fed.  More K-Fed.  This could just be K-Fed. 
[02:54:30]  You gonna sing along with it?  That's the Jingle Ball?  No.  No.  You gonna pump a fish in the air.  Gonna rave.  Gonna do some X or some E.  Whatever they call it.  All right.  I got the lineup for the Jingle Ball.  By the way, the only reason I know that he's going to the Jingle Ball is because he gave  me his tickets by accident in a DAL package.  Or he would have flew under the radar.  Ah.  How'd you get them?  What a slip-up.  Um, they, they weren't my tickets.  They were actually Rich Voss's tickets.  And Voss had to turn them down, so I got them. 
[02:55:00]  Why do you think fucking Parliament Funkadelic was playing there, that fucking old man?  I don't know.  I'm sure they were for his kids.  But, uh.  They gotta buy their love.  They're Sly and the Family Stone playing?  Fucking stupid Voss and his old man taste.  The person he contacted for the tickets actually gave me the voicemails that Voss left with  him to try to get the tickets.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Are they good?  Um, yeah.  He insists that he's a television star and that maybe they need a presenter to bring out  one of the bands.  No, he doesn't.  Are you shitting me?  No, he doesn't.  He's pitching himself while he's asking for free tickets. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, he's, he's great.  Uh, problem?  No.  You got these, didn't you, Than?  No, he just deflects the focus so well.  Now it's all about Voss.  Yeah, you know what?  But if he's got Voss voicemail.  Himmit.  That's right.  He looks out today.  I hate that he put his shields up.  Go track two?  Mm-hmm.  Our shields are brought.  Hi, this is Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Hey, if by any chance you have three zoo tickets kicking around, my daughters keep bothering 
[02:56:00]  me.  But I hate to put you in a position and ask for these.  I'll even pay for them or whatever.  It's a tongue in a position to say that word.  Or if they cost anything or whatever.  Uh, let me know.  Give me a call either way.  But there's no pressure.  If it can happen, it can happen.  If it can't, well.  Yeah.  Tough shit on them, huh?  All right.  I'll be at Caroline's tonight, too.  Like at 730.  He's plugging.  Bye.  All right.  What a vulture.  The end of that message should be, have you checked the children? 
[02:56:30]  That creepy voice he has.  You hear the breathing?  He's calling from upstairs.  You hear the breathing?  You hear the breathing.  Get out of the house.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hi.  It's Rich Voss.  We traced the call.  It's coming from a bank.  That's the only one?  Track three, too.  Track three?  He called back.  Hey, Rich Voss.  What's going on?  Rich Voss.  I have a couple of things I have to talk to you about.  I want to find out about that Jingle Bell, whatever it's called. 
[02:57:00]  Jingle Bell.  I don't know.  My kids keep bothering me.  What day it is.  Maybe if I can get some tickets.  You know, maybe I'll even introduce if you need.  You know, I can introduce a band or two.  I'm kind of well known, you know.  It wouldn't hurt.  Anyhow, give me a call.  I'll call this well.  I'm working around your area coming up in Jersey.  And somewhere there, around there.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  You have a lovely day.  Bye.  Who did he leave these messages for?  A friend who works over there, Dave. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, my God.  The guy that does the song parodies?  Maybe you need me to introduce you.  Justin Timberlake with the Killers, you fucking ass.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, Rich Voss.  That's right.  Crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets.  Oh, boy.  Crickets, crickets, crickets.  We got them?  I got the one moment, please.  Sorry.  I saw the swines. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Now we don't have them?  All right.  Oh, damn it.  All right.  We'll enjoy it.  Fucking Bill is dressed like every wacky beach guy from an 80s movie.  Oh, man.  Bill gave me his 20-year plan the other day, though.  It was terrific.  What is his 20-year plan?  What is his 20-year fucking plan?  Maintain for 19 years and then improve?  We all went out to lunch and I... 
[02:58:30]  Fade quickly.  Sorry.  I didn't hear you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You missed nothing.  All right.  We all went to lunch and I decided to sit across from Bill.  I said, Bill, how's it going?  And we got into talking about his 20-year plan, which is to live in the woods by himself like who?  Well, no, I want to...  Is this on the air or just in our headphones?  No, this is on the air.  Okay, good.  My plan was one day just to do something really successful and then disappear like J.D. Salinger.  Uh-huh.  And just take it all for granted. 
[02:59:00]  The key is to one day do something successful so that you can then leave and people would notice that you're gone.  You would live in the woods or something, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  Like a mountain man?  You can grow one of those beards.  Siberia.  Siberia.  So you want to go somewhere really remote.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Wow, that's the 20-year plan.  You know, some people just have simple plans.  That's a unique plan.  Yeah.  Let's the bomb an abortion clinic and then hide.  What's going on?  Hi, Rich.  How's it going, pal?  Pretty good, TV star. 
[02:59:30]  Why am I a TV star?  Exactly.  That's what we hear.  That's what we hear.  Well, you're pretty needed when it comes to major famous people.  Your death should be on the bill.  You know, you're kind of well-known, you know.  Yeah.  What are you trying to say?  Nothing.  You're kind of well-known, you know.  Well-known, you know.  You're well-known.  You're playing Caroline soon.  Yeah.  Well, I am a big act.  I mean...  I don't know.  Maybe I can introduce a band or two.  Yeah, maybe you can introduce an act.  Or two if you need me.  Well, here's the thing.  You know, when you have, you know, my exposure. 
[03:00:00]  You know, I was just at MySpace looking at my friends, and I have a lot of friends.  You were at MySpace?  First of all, there's no one in Jingle Balls over the age of 25.  Yeah.  And they're the old people.  If you're 25 at the Jingle Ball, you're the old guy at the Jingle Ball.  You might recognize this presenter if your parents enjoy comedy.  Well, here's the thing.  Why do you want to be a buzzkill and go with your daughters?  Let them go alone.  Well, first of all, how am I doing...  Okay, when at Jingle Balls, how am I going to go into the city alone at their age? 
[03:00:30]  What are they going to do?  How old are they?  The best time they went was, I think, two years ago, a year or two years ago.  How old are they?  Now or then?  Now they're 16 and 14.  I bet you then they were 14 and 12.  Yeah, so, okay.  Why don't you take the clock, these kids, and head into the city?  Okay.  See, you made a funny out of it.  They're a little young.  All right, that's fair enough.  That's terrific.  If it wasn't a cool dad, I mean, he gets along with them, so they wouldn't mind hanging with him. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, they wouldn't.  Yeah, not at all.  I'm taking the shows.  I was going to bring him to the traveling virus.  Yeah?  You know, but...  What happened?  I don't know.  Whatever.  Where are you, man?  What's that?  Where are you?  I'm in my kitchen getting ready to play golf.  Huh?  No, you're in Jersey.  Yeah.  No, my kitchen's in Oklahoma, but I live in Jersey.  I wish it were.  It should be in the fucking Federal Muir building.  Yeah, so what are you saying that, uh, because... 
[03:01:30]  Oh, we seem to have been disconnected from, um...  Hey, Anthony...  Blanche is one of our spotters, too, by the way, right?  For Saturday?  Oh, I hope so.  I'm sure it'll be very funny.  Yeah.  Pretty well known.  Shopping spree, I hope so.  I'm pretty well known now.  Oh, I love him.  Here's the intro to the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Here it is, uh, all the stars.  Trying to get back on track.  Everything Lucas is is in this intro.  Nice.  The Star Wars Holiday Special. 
[03:02:00]  Starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.  Oh, we know.  Harrison Ford as Han Solo.  Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.  With Anthony Daniels as C-3PO.  Billy Dee Williams as the purse snatcher.  Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca.  Oh.  R2-D2 as R2-D2.

[03:03:30]  And Sharon Tate as the lasagna.  Oh, what a bunch of shitheads.  That sucks.  Oh, Lumpy.  The son's name was Lumpy.  Lumpy.  Why would you name him that?  That's great.  Unless he's Chewbacca's son has cancer.  Then I accept it.  Ah, Lumpy. 
[03:04:00]  Big blotch of the spots of his hair coming out.  Hello?  Hi.  What's up, boss?  First of all, why would you hang up on me?  I didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  I'm me.  I'm Jim.  Okay, whatever.  You call me attacking me for looking out for my young'uns, okay, what a good dad would  do.  How many fathers?  You know how many tickets?  Well, that's besides the point.  I don't even know what I said in this recording that you played, but it was probably... 
[03:04:30]  You actually plugged a gig, a Caroline's gig, to one guy on an answering machine.  Yes.  Yeah, but that one guy might have made me hit bonus.  You don't know.  Okay.  He's always thinking.  That could have put me over the top.  He knows how to market himself.  You know...  One person at a time.  Dude, how's your show doing, Rich?  Have you guys had any word?  What's that?  Your show, have you heard any word yet or no?  I saw the pilot.  I got it here.  You happy?  It is so funny.  I mean, what they kept.  Patrice is, without a doubt, one of the funniest men alive in this thing. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going to show it to you guys.  I'll come in one day.  But it's really funny, but who knows?  What is it?  It's a pilot, Rich.  It's a pilot we did for Comedy Central.  Oh, cool.  So, it's funny.  Anyhow, I'll see you guys Saturday.  And any good dad would have done what I did for my...  Who's getting dressed over there?  Who's that in the corner?  Oh.  Anthony, who's that in the top right of the paltrow?  Renee's Vengeance.  God damn it, she has a nice body.  Well, she was just completely naked.  Oh, can I see your breasts, Renee, please? 
[03:05:30]  We missed the show.  I didn't see it.  I want to see her bosom.  She has a great fucking body.  The old pal talk sideshow, you know.  Yeah.  There, girls naked.  I'm squeezing my cockshaft and she's ignoring me.  Thanks a million.  Well.  Thanks a million.  Well, we have the two minutes of Wookiees talking.  Yeah, listen to this.  It just goes on and on.  It goes to a commercial, I think.  This is the fucking opening of the special.  After that dog shit Han Solo poorly acted thing by Harrison Ford.  How dare you, Mr. President. 
[03:06:00]  Go fuck yourself.  And then the stupid opening.  This is where they go to.  To Treehouse.  No subtitles, by the way.  Really?  No.  That's lumpy shitting.  Come on. 
[03:06:30]  Wait.  Right.  There's the father choking on something.  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  Oh.  look at how this goes on they're just doing family things  it's fucking awful  uh...  uh...  uh... 
[03:07:30]  uh...  uh...  can you fucking believe this  and it just they're not even doing anything where you know what they're talking about is supposed to be doing  well here's the line mad in new york city a very merry terry shivo christmas 
[03:08:00]  yeah  well that does sound like her  i just want you to fucking lick my ass and suck lumpy's cock  if you agree with it just look me in the eye and go  why would chewbacca want to get home to those fucking zeros  oh please a renee's vengeance could you drop a log on that seat what a dumper she has  fucking why would you want to race home through space for that  and han solo and fucking harrison's ford acting in that clip stunk  because you know something uninspired drivel  yeah he's he's believe me he's not the best actor 
[03:08:30]  and uh... he uh...  he obviously did not want to do this  looked at it like it's dog shit  and didn't want to fucking do it  but he had to sit there and act like  first of all  they're supposed to be like intergalactic smugglers  the guy kills people  you know he kills the other other  little alien things and things that are threatening his life  runs from the law smuggles things  he's a criminal  yes  and there he is  i'll get you home to your family 
[03:09:00]  but what is it  what is that chewbacca's family think  that he's a criminal  that chewbacca's a fight  he's a criminal  and he wants to get home for life day  life day  what does that mean  they all hang out in the tree house and do what  yeah i don't know  chewbacca fingers his wife  and tells the father he's a burden  and tells the kid he was a mistake  and then the fucking like  it was like christmas in the projects pretty much  because the cops wind up coming to the house  the uh... imperial uh... uh... 
[03:09:30]  stormtroopers come to the house  looking for chewbacca  yeah  and they cover for him and say no we don't know where it is  i don't know  how does every fucking person speak that awful language  how does han solo speak it  yeah  how do you understand that  it is such garbage  that lucas tried to pull every single copy from existence  and it does nothing but sell like hotcakes at star wars conventions 
[03:10:00]  they all want a copy  everyone wants one  and every nerd  that's worth their salt has a copy  and why by the way  did he approve this  it had to be approved by him  i think again  back then  he was thinking  you know this is a one hit wonder  star wars thing  it's got some momentum  let me capitalize while i can  and didn't realize it was going to go to fucking you know  thirty fucking years of milking this cow  and by the way why doesn't this fucking no self a humor asshole  just release it and say it's one of the worst things ever done on dvd 
[03:10:30]  people would buy it  yeah  why not just admit what it is  hey it was a bad move  it's 28 years ago  he cannot  the commentary would be hilarious  yes  he wants to i hear  take themselves too seriously in hollywood  he cannot possibly fit any more money in the lucas vault  yeah  tamp it down  harrison ford going oh my god look at how awful i am in this scene  i just was uninspired we hated the script  make fun of it  yeah uh uh princess leia  let uh carrie fisher talk about how she was doped up singing that song 
[03:11:00]  at the end she sings a song and she is so drugged out of her mind  and mark hamill in in his big scene uh with r2d2  is wearing so much makeup  it is embarrassing to watch  i have to see i have to get a copy of the whole thing  yeah  how long is it  it goes on forever  dude it is like two fucking hours long  and doesn't does doesn't be arthur say  god's gonna get you for that darth 
[03:11:30]  she plays the bartender at that cantina that you love so much  rap dat dat dat dat  oh that fucking  and she's the  she's the like real spicy bartender  giving some guff to the people at the bar  hey you  my cock's a lot bigger than yours fucko  and that  you know  awful elephant playing the piano with his  ah  big dumb elephant fingers  i i wanna fucking tie lucas up  and make him watch that while i rape him 
[03:12:00]  the the mute  fuck his little backside  the the musicians playing this absolutely looked like  like asses  with  clarinet shoved up their asses  and that's how they were playing the music  big asses  clarinet shoved in the asshole  they look like puppets  then you got some  well just  no  i just like sitting here  oh  um  no they obviously had no budget for it  yeah  so they wanted something exciting to happen  so halfway through 
[03:12:30]  uh... the movie  they just switched to a cartoon  yeah it was a  right out of nowhere  a cartoon  uh...  with the animated characters  i i  that had nothing to do really  with what was going on  with the plot  that thick plot  of the the special itself  and then  my favorite  was um  the scene with the old  uh...  grandpa there  what was his name  midge me  midge me  he's sitting there  and he gets a present  that is 
[03:13:00]  diane carroll i guess  doing an erotic dance  in miniature  she's like a little  super post miniature thing  and he is  what amounts to  in in in wookie  jerking off  to her doing this exotic dance  to interspliced music  and and video of the jefferson starship  right right  it is fucking all over the place  and i'll bet you why they did the cartoon  they probably want to stretch it for x amount of time  to get the commercials in  and they probably ran out of materials 
[03:13:30]  so they said let's do the cartoon  or it was the advertiser cartoons  they were going to fucking  show on saturday morning  let's go to schwogie  schwogie  hey boba boys what's going on  first appearance of boba fett  yes  was in that cartoon  was it really  yes  a little trivia  hey  hey  let's know this whole thing  is available on youtube  you gotta hunt around  because they broke up in parts  travis told me that  the whole thing was up there  but they took it down  but you can find this whole thing  on youtube  i just saw part of it on youtube  i couldn't see how shitty the set  anthony mentioned the set was bad 
[03:14:00]  like the uh  when they were in the imperial of the ship  yeah the flight deck  set is so bad  it is not the flight deck  that they had in the movie  obviously  it's just some cheap little thing  that shakes a little bit  and  so bad  and then they use all the stock footage  well let's get the millennium falcon  let's get the princess leia  doing her little song  okay here's carrie fisher  who knew she could sing  and the best part about the fucking father  was when he was yelling at chewbacca  and he goes  now the earthlings at kenner have asked my associate and me to present the star wars collection 
[03:14:30]  truly remarkable toys and games for your  ah yeah there's the pitch  that's the whole fucking spectrum  there's the pitch  well this is labeled uh  i must have flipped those  it's coming around christmas time  so you gotta sell  you gotta sell  uh yeah okay  life's day  princess lair  princess lair  this holiday is yours  but we all share with you the hope  that this day  yes  freedom  and to harmony  and to peace  no matter how different we appear 
[03:15:00]  we're all the same  in our struggle against the powers of evil and darkness  yeah  i hope that this day will always be a day of joy  in which we can reconfirm  our dedication  and our courage  and more than anything else  than anything else  our love for one another  wait who is she singing to  this is the promise of the tree of life  oh and then  and then she is  here she is  i've got a new life  you would hardly make the night  i'm so glad  i'm new  it's not as bad as i remember it being  i cannot shut it off now until she says it 
[03:15:30]  i don't care  i saw the script  is enough enough  i saw the sign  and it opened up my eyes  i saw the sign  life is demanding  without understanding  i saw the sign  and it opened up my eyes  it saw the sign  no one's gonna drag you up  to get into the light where you belong 
[03:16:00]  i'll be able to hear you  i'll be able to hear you  i'll be able to hear you  i'll be able to hear you  it's all brown  she's great  we celebrate  a day of peace  a day of harmony  who would sit through this  Who would sit through this?  Mabel King walked out.  I believe she's singing to Chewie's family and everyone else. 
[03:16:30]  Is she in the treehouse?  Holy shit.  Like, what the fuck were they thinking?  I don't know.  Trying to work with actual Star Wars music into it?  Yeah, to hold someone's interest.  Oh.  Where's Vader to choke her out? 
[03:17:00]  This is what people who enjoyed the movie Star Wars wanted to see.  Apparently not. He pulled every copy.  People don't realize that this got the voice of a way to have a...  Oh, darn.  Oh, shit.  Oh, darn.  Oh, darn.  Oh, darn.  Oh, darn.  Yes.  Get her with the Imperial Taser. 
[03:17:30]  Is there anything else you want to play off this?  I'm so annoyed.  It is so...  Yeah, watch it.  Another...  I mean, we got more Wookiee talking.  We got Art Carney, Jefferson Starship.  Let's hear it.  Art Carney, what does he do?  He's got to be awful.  He's the comic relief.  B.O. Arthur.  What does he do?  And B.O. Arthur.  I don't...  He just...  He's a handyman, I think, or something like that.  Yes, he's the one that took images of Lumpy and put them on his hard drive and was file  trading with Gary Glitter.  Boo!  Look at this...  Look at this Wookiee cock! 
[03:18:00]  Hit it, Lumpy boy!  He would...  Ah!  Don't get his knee!  Ah!  When I was a boy, my favorite thing was the Star Wars Holiday Special.  It actually brought a smile to my face when the Wookiees were hugging.  Horrid.  Excuse me.  Got a wall screen custody.  Go to see you again. 
[03:18:30]  Don't say a word, madam.  I know just why you're calling.  You're wondering when that shaggy carpet you ordered will arrive at your home.  But to be assure you, madam, it's on its way.  You know, it's right especially for you by a little old woman four planets away.  She did it all by herself.  In fact, you might say she did it by hand.  Solo.  Oh.  So it's going to take some time to get to you.  Speaking in code.  I know you understand.  Understand, right? 
[03:19:00]  Terrific.  By the way, I'll be by later to drop off that extra proton energy pack.  You're welcome.  That's right.  He was getting messages from Han Solo and Chewie as to when they were going to arrive  and had to convey that message to them.  But it didn't code because, you know, the Empire, they were listening.  So he used such a tricky code.  Shaggy carpet is shaggy carpet.  And then Han Solo.  Oh, that's a good one.  That code was only trumped by the code in Star Trek, where if we go by the book, it will 
[03:19:30]  take three days.  If days seem like hours, how long will it take?  Three days by the book.  Get it?  And there's Khan supposed to be some super fucking human intelligence and everything.  I can't figure out the code.  He tasks me.  He tasks me, but I shall have him with his tricky code. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, if we go by the book, days will seem like hours.  How long to fix it?  Three days, if we go by the book.  Could that be a fucking code?  That's maybe what they figured.  Khan would just go, that can't possibly be a fucking code.  It must really be three days.  Oh, wow.  And the whole time fucking Art Carney is talking in code, the cameraman is blinking out torture.  Are we done with this?  I think we should. 
[03:20:30]  Here's what we should do to the XMers is straighten them out.  We should fucking start it from the beginning and play it in real time.  And leave.  The entire special.  It's two hours long.  Hey, when we get back, are you going to get a new haircut?  I don't know what a haircut is.  It's a hairdo.  Thank you.  Hairdo.  Boys get haircuts.  Right.  Sophisticated gentlemen have hairdos.  We're giving Jimmy a horseshoe.  How low can we go?  How low?  Fuck all the way down.  No, not bald.  But it's got to be like the lowest setting on the old Clipper Rooney.  Right. 
[03:21:00]  No, I mean like how low on the side do you think?  Fuck whatever you guys decide.  Whatever it looks like.  Whatever it looks the most sophisticated and gentlemanly.  Jimmy gets a horseshoe.  Hairdo.  Next.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby.  Hobby.  Bubby.  Shoot.  Shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  Shoot.  All I got to say to XM Satellite is...  Fuck my dick.  I can't give me no money.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, cash up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch nigga, stop pushing me. 
[03:21:30]  Fuck you, bitch.  XM 202.  What was the first sequel?  Sequel ever?  Yeah.  Does anyone know the answer to that?  Yes, they do, actually.  No, you don't.  I do.  I'm not buying it. 
[03:22:00]  Okay.  First sequel ever, I would say...  Hmm.  It was the Manchurian Candidate Takes Manhattan.  Could have been.  What was the first sequel, really?  Oh, Loads of Laughs 2.  Yeah?  It was the sequel to Birth of a Nation.  I was just thinking of something that Planet of the Apes was a sequel to.  Oh, boy, do I have one.  Oh, goodness, no.  Oh, no, I can't. 
[03:22:30]  You know the answer, Travis?  Well, I just Googled it.  Oh.  And it wasn't far off.  It was a sequel to Birth of a Nation.  There was a sequel to Birth of a Nation?  Yeah, Fall of the Nation.  Follow the Nation.  No, Fall of.  Oh, Fall of.  The Nation.  Yeah.  The year after.  Sounds depressing.  Yep.  Birth of a Nation was a great movie.  Roots was a great series, too.  Is that the sequel to something?  I'm not sure of why.  I don't know who it was or not.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:00]  I don't know.  I just wasn't sure of what it was.  It was a great series.  I met Ben Verena outside of XM one day.  Ben Verena?  Oh, maybe there's a soft shoe for you.  Maybe there's some other people out there that have sequels for us today, all right?  Sequels.  We're doing a bit called sequels.  Sequels.  If you have a sequel to a famous film, give us a call.  Like Renee's Vengeance.  That's a sequel to Jim's Rape.  She comes over.  She's mad.  Thank you.  You took a medial...  We both pile into a tree.  Well, I will say that you did jump on board a vehicle that was really trying to ride itself 
[03:23:30]  to begin with.  I always hope I could just kind of grab the wheel and steer clear.  What's this?  What the fuck?  And there was just some cross-eyed guy on...  Cross-eyed...  Danny's just laughing at a cross-eyed guy on television.  Well, of course.  You got it.  Yeah.  And I have the, um...  Hey, look at a piss-eyed asshole on TV.  Time to get a new...  Give Jimmy a new hairdo.  Hairdo.  Let's do this.  Well, how about my cape for my hair?  So my hair doesn't get all over my shirt. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, where's that purple...  I was certain that we decided that.  Sam's ready with his camera.  I was certain.  This is...  Yes, we know that other shows have given these.  So before they go,  You know, they're stealing that from...  Hey, let me tell you something.  We'll give haircuts.  My fucking hairdo I came in with one day, uninspired from...  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Do you want your hair washed before this?  We know they do other...  We know they do haircuts.  Well, I suggest that we get somebody to get some tape and fix this  so I don't get hairs all over the place. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, right.  There's nothing more unattractive than hairs.  Yeah, I figured you wouldn't like much hair.  Yeah, I'll tell you something.  To that lumpy, it's a tattletale.  Is he?  Yeah.  Thank God no one can understand him.  Yeah, he's one of...  I bet he did.  Yeah, he did.  That was before he was griping about it.  Did I just say we don't have tape?  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm just kidding.  Jimmy, turn around.  They want photos.  How much clips are in the back? 
[03:25:00]  The studio audience wants photos.  Turn around.  There you go.  They're laughing as...  It's purple and...  I don't want to get hair down the back of my neck, Dan.  Is this clipped properly in the back?  Don't just clip the front clip in the back.  Where's the little brush that they go...  Ah, wow.  It would be 400-pound homoerotic man Andy  who used to rub his fucking crotch on my elbow.  Oh, can I do...  Can I stand in, please?  Yes.  What was the song he sang?  Conundrum?  Uh, Pendulum. 
[03:25:30]  Pendulum.  That is right.  It's Pendulum from Stephen Carr,  the Ben Foundry.  Guys, sequels are coming in.  Doug from Jersey.  Philadelphia is the sequel to Brokeback Mountain.  Ah.  It could be.  Sure.  Sure.  Come on, let's get started.  The Brady Bunch movie.  Don't make me look stupid, Dan.  All right.  Jimmy's getting ahead.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Now, do you have a model to go off of?  Yes, the Conrad Janet.  Let's see.  That's perfect.  Oh, my God.  You're doing that?  All right.  Get a nice straight line.  Make it look good.  Start just a straight line right up the middle. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  I would do the outline first.  Oh, really?  I would have.  It's too late now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Shave that head.  Now, make sure you know how far...  See, that's why I'd go around the edge now.  Let's establish this now.  If there's hair on my head you need to remove, don't blow it off.  I just felt Danny go on the top of my head.  Oh, that's not good.  And I'd appreciate it if that didn't happen again.  Danny, you must now do the outline where the horseshoe is going to be. 
[03:26:30]  Very carefully.  Or else it's going to be uneven.  Very careful.  Find some landmarks.  Don't go too low.  Go too high if you have to.  Yeah, yeah, you could always...  Right.  Measure twice.  Cut once.  Something like that.  Hey, I remember that.  Yeah.  It's not a fucking ice sculpture you're making.  Get to it.  Why aren't you going around in a line like that way?  I wanted to see the line first. 
[03:27:00]  No, just cut.  No, no, no.  I mean just, yeah, cut.  My God.  There we go.  All the way around.  And make sure you cut the front good, too.  I don't want any hair sticking up.  Jesus Christ.  Like a plucked chicken.  Fucking...  Wow.  That's a pretty good razor, huh?  What do you think, Jim?  You're not feeling any pain or anything, right?  No.  I wouldn't just sit quietly and take it. 
[03:27:30]  As he's slicing skin tags off.  Front, front, front, front.  Those things that fat shows have on their necks.  Pop it off like Cocoa Krispies.  That's what it sounds like when a skin tag pops off.  Yeah.  Can you spin, please?  Oh, spin in your chair?  I don't have enough cord, I don't think.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  How's that, son?  That's good.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  My father was prematurely bald.  He went bald when he was 17. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, my God.  That is really funny.  That is really funny.  Don't make Danny laugh.  Put the other half there.  Oh, my God.  Go around.  Don't make me look stupid.  Jim Norton.  Bank manager.  Your son is attempting.  Yeah.  That's right.  Give him the Dilbert Grady.  I want the Grady. 
[03:28:30]  There's his mark.  And now he's wrapping around the other way.  On the left side of Jimmy's head.  Yes, they are the same clippers that were used on Patty's crotch yesterday.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone's asking.  Yeah.  They're correct.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Like they say, you're supposed to go from badge to ass, not the other way around.  I may not have headphones on, but you don't whisper good. 
[03:29:00]  That's all those years of radio.  I know.  I meant you to hear it.  I thought he was talking to a flea.  No headphones.  And he's got a fucking razor going in his ear and he still hears me.  We're going to go lower on the sides, right?  Yeah.  We should go a little low.  You're so uneven.  You're fucking retarded.  Look how much higher it is.  Look at Danny.  Oh my God.  Look straight at Danny.  Dan, you're going to make me look stupid.  Look at the picture.  Look at the picture. 
[03:29:30]  Let me see a mirror.  Look how much it is at the front and how it tapers around the back.  Wait.  He doesn't have to shave this.  He's not going to make this any lower.  I think he should.  No, no, no, no.  He's not going to shorten it.  He'll just make it lower on my head.  Right.  Lower on your head.  Go ahead, Dan.  Get to it, Dan.  I want to look distinguished.  Yeah.  I have a function to go to.  We should get a sharpie and paint the smooth.  Oh yeah, sure.  I want to get some spray paint and put a cock on my face.  We'll have a laugh. 
[03:30:00]  How about we don't do that?  I'm a human being, not a fucking, who am I, the fat kid from Z100?  He's the gymster.  Sorry.  Oh, that's funny, Jim.  He's trying to even it out a little.  Yes, that's why the homoerotic hand resting on the shoulder.  Gently.  You should be behind me when you're doing that.  Just whispering, it's okay. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, it's kind of looking good.  More sequels coming in.  Matt from New York City.  It's a Wonderful Life, the sequel to Schindler's List.  Wow.  Let me see.  Oh, I like it.  It looks good.  It's distinguished.  Yeah.  I think you need to taper a little bit of the, yeah.  Like, so it's, like, you could take the razor and tilt a little and just taper, because 
[03:31:00]  it's such a fine ledge.  Like, it's a perfect ledge of hair.  So more of a thinning, like it would be thinning, kind of.  Very slowly do it.  Don't do it extremely.  Yes.  I want to keep a lot of this hair to show the juxtaposition.  Yeah.  As you round it off in the back properly, Young Ben?  Wait.  The back has to be a little lower.  A little lower?  Yeah, doesn't it kind of scoop in the back?  I think it swoops down a little.  It swoops down a little more.  It doesn't have to be exactly like his.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really bad.  Yeah, that's good. 
[03:31:30]  I want to look distinguished.  Yeah.  So, and if you taper it, it'll be like you just got a nice haircut.  This is a gentleman's hairdo.  Yes.  It is.  You should be at a cocktail lounge ordering in Manhattan with that.  I want to be a gentleman with a gentleman's hairdo.  Then don't shake your head.  What?  Don't move.  Oh, my God.  That was close.  I know.  Just thin a little bit.  There you go.  It's like artwork.  Hey. 
[03:32:00]  A little artist.  Hey.  Oh, that's good.  See?  Now, see?  It's all in the details.  Yeah, yeah.  That's working.  I just can't wait to wake my girlfriend up when I get home and try to fuck her with this haircut.  That's right.  See how wet you get now, toots.  Put on your best acting hat.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's working nicely.  A little taper.  A little thinning.  Very good. 
[03:32:30]  Very good.  Oh, that.  That's what did it.  Let me see.  That did it.  That's perfect.  How am I?  Wait, eight foot six?  Can you lower it?  I'm sorry, dude.  Eight foot six.  Like, eight feet isn't tall enough.  What?  You said eight foot six.  Like, eight feet isn't quite tall enough.  What am I, eight feet six three?  Yeah, I like that.  It's a little bit, um, it's distinguished.  Yeah.  I think you should clean it up.  It might be. 
[03:33:00]  No, no, no.  I would say, first of all, you missed a spot here.  Do I have to do this myself?  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  I'm going to do this.  Give me the mirror.  I'm doing this for you.  Awful purple robe.  Calendry.  From the Stephen Carr collection.  I was hoping this would be hung up at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yes.  Instead, it's being showcased in a rest area by exit five. 
[03:33:30]  That is the gayest color anything could come in.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, the tighter you get that bald part, the better the contrast of where the horseshoe  baldness.  Wow, that is funny.  I'll tell you, on anyone else that would make anyone look real old and older, Jimmy's just 
[03:34:00]  got such a baby face that it just doesn't affect it.  He kind of looks hip.  Yeah.  You could actually start a new hairstyle.  You're pulling off the fucking bald guy horseshoe.  Now fix it like a...  Make it more even.  I chopped it a little bit, but I just wanted to...  You're pulling off the old guy horseshoe baldness head cut.  Maybe I'm debating getting actually...  Ooh, thanks a lot, Dan.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Pushed in his stool.  We're toenails tomorrow. 
[03:34:30]  All right, we get it.  I know.  You'll have nine options to put in that fucking shotgun thing when you realize she'll never  love you.  Nine options to hit that shotgun trigger.  Shotgun thing.  Way to spoil a joke with no word.  Oh, yeah.  Make it nice and even, Dan.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he's wrapping around.  Now you got a ledge again.  That's all right. 
[03:35:00]  We'll fix the ledge.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  There he goes, Dan.  He's a little quicker this time around.  He's more confident.  Yeah, I know he is.  In his haircutting prowess.  Hmm.  Around the back.  Dan's a pedophile.  This is how he meets neighborhood children.  He has a sign on his door that says, haircuts, and he spells cuts, C-U-T-Z, and the kids  think he's hip and fun.  And the Z is backwards.  Yeah, it's backwards.  Backwards. 
[03:35:30]  Taper the other side a little.  Taper the other side, Dan.  I don't want to look stupid.  Wow.  Fix the line, though.  Oh, you're such a sweet boy.  I fixed the line.  Huh?  Well, huh.  A little music to get a haircut by.  Look at the back.  If you had a razor, I would have to go bald on the top.  Wow.  That would look amazing.  I want to see that one.  Awful.  Can I do it?  Oh.  You're the guy. 
[03:36:00]  He definitely has to do it.  Oh, man.  Get close.  A little shit.  I already got it, girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  It's demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up.  You can get into the lights where you belong.  It's not like we haven't heard it 80 times already.  I love it. 
[03:36:30]  There it is.  There it is.  Wow.  What do you think, Jimmy?  That looks good.  All right.  Well, I don't want Dan to do.  Uh-oh.  Give me the topic for it.  Fucking.  Fucking.  It's a picky gym.  Do you mind?  It's my head.  That's true.  I would like you to go over the top, like right here, by the way, in here.  Okay.  And back here.  I want this to be all.  See, I can feel it with my hand.  Stubble.  I can feel it.  I'll give it another once over.  How about a fucking 30 times over?  I can fall even.  I can do this myself.  I do this myself without a mirror. 
[03:37:00]  I can get it.  And I know you're doing it in a circle.  But I can feel it right there.  Right there.  You can see it from here.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll see how Jimmy's hairdo turns out.  Fucking leather face is fucking cutting my hair.  After these messages.  Hairdo.  You're trying for a baby.  It's a magical time.  And you're going to want a home pregnancy kit that you can trust.  I'm nervous.  I'm nervous.  We've been trying for about three or four months now to get pregnant.  Yeah.  I think this time it's, I feel good about it. 
[03:37:30]  I do too.  This time.  Yeah.  We've been wanting to have kids for quite some time.  I think we're ready.  Both of us.  Yeah.  We're both ready.  Both ready.  Ready together.  This is it.  This is it.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Eric Logan on the line. 
[03:38:00]  Elo.  Hey, guys.  What's up, buddy?  I'm sorry I missed your call.  I'm in a high-level meeting.  We talked about it earlier.  We're so excited about the XM commercials that will be hitting the market tonight, tomorrow.  Yeah.  Here's the update.  That piece of music at the end, which I think just totally makes the spot, too.  You have to get clearance when you run these things.  We should get clearance this morning.  It could be online as early as this afternoon, this evening, but probably more likely tomorrow morning at the latest.  So that's two weeks. 
[03:38:30]  Two weeks.  We're not going to have a problem with that music, are we?  What's that?  We're not going to have a problem with the music, are we?  No, no, no, no.  No, we're just negotiating this.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Elo has his own fucking machine.  Elo rules.  That is really funny.  The Opie and Anthony XM commercial, where is it going to run?  Well, assuming we can get the networks to accept it, we'll see,  but it's probably going to certainly start off on cable and a lot of the cable channels. 
[03:39:00]  So this is a national spot?  No, I mean, we're going to try to buy this thing, but again, because...  Wait, I just said, is this a national spot?  You said no?  Like all over the country?  Yes.  Wow.  How about Canada?  Okay.  What about Canada?  Nah, we don't need Canada.  Yeah, fuck Canada.  Oh, that's what he thinks of Canada.  Jesus.  I was on the phone with Canada earlier, but whatever.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, what else could you add?  To the show, I got nothing. 
[03:39:30]  I know.  I bring nothing to the table.  Jimmy wants to talk to you.  He's got his horseshoe hairdo.  His new hairdo.  That's right.  Two gentlemen speaking to each other.  Now Eric and I are a little bit more equal.  It's two businessmen.  Thank you, Eric, for XM, for putting me in this little commercial.  You didn't have to do that.  It was very nice.  Oh.  But you're the star of the commercial.  No, not the other way.  Not at all.  Not at all.  You're the star of the spot.  We needed him in this commercial.  XM is very nice.  Part of this program.  The outtakes are going to be hilarious. 
[03:40:00]  Yes.  Yeah, and actually, I was talking this morning after we spoke before you guys went on the  air at CBS with Gary and Chris Walsh, who is the guy who's doing all the editing, who's  done an amazing job.  He's got some really cool ideas.  I shared with him your idea for the outtakes.  So it's going to be good.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be very viral.  Yes.  All right.  It'll hit the internet by tomorrow at the latest, right?  At the absolute latest.  But we are working really hard to get it done.  And again, when I say music getting cleared, not a problem with the music.  It's just negotiating the fee.  Right.  Everything's a negotiation. 
[03:40:30]  That's what we do.  Yep.  All right, Elo.  Thank you, Elo.  Did you like the show today?  You know, I heard the first half.  I didn't hear what you did on XM, so.  Oh, wow.  That's odd.  That's the beautiful thing about a replay.  Yep.  Did you like what you heard on the first half of the show?  I did like what I hear on the first half of the show.  Especially with you trying to figure out how to navigate the knobs with shots of Dom Perignon on the board.  Yeah, he actually did it.  Yeah, it was pretty impressive.  Yeah, it was.  All right.  All right.  I need your home addresses, boys, so I can send you all Christmas presents. 
[03:41:00]  Oh.  All right.  I never got one last year.  Mine is.  Just email.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Will you open up your email?  I sent you an email.  I want you to see real quick.  All right.  Is it scat?  It's not.  Scat video?  It's what that?  Scat video?  No, no, no.  It was an e-card.  Because that's how you set your Christmas cards?  Well, I do.  No, my girlfriend sent out pictures of our festive house.  Yeah.  How big is that wreath, by the way? 
[03:41:30]  I heard it was massive.  It's about nine feet across.  Eight or nine feet across.  Wow.  So you just took a tree and bent it.  Bent it into a circle.  Wow.  Look at you.  E-Lo has sent you a holiday card.  A holiday card.  All right.  Let me open that up.  Open the card.  This is the new XF viral marketing.  Yeah.  Give my computer a virus.  Something something dot exe file.  Yeah.  Just open up that.  The boy lover photos dot exe.  All right. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, that's nice.  Welcome to your holiday card.  Turn it on.  I clicked the link.  It's a festive little Christmas living room scene with reindeer.  And they have, of course, the XM.  Yellow thing.  Yellow triple.  What is that being called?  How did you guys take fucking parentheses and make that the company symbol?  It works.  It works.  Parentheses is our middle name.  What are those things being called?  The XM waves.  It's the XM wave.  I knew they'd have that because it's sound waves. 
[03:42:30]  They're sound waves, right?  So the little reindeer have antlers made out of the sound waves.  They do.  And they're dancing around the living room.  Very nice.  Elo, thank you so much for my...  Now, here's the great news.  We'll have that link.  We can put it on foundry music.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  And all of the pests around the world can send the XM love.  Yes, because I see that there's an XM special holiday offer right there on the card.  Right.  Yes. 
[03:43:00]  Holiday offer for you to buy your very own XM.  And you can even tailor it and custom it.  That's why yours had a menorah for your neighborhood.  Thank you.  Hey, no one ever told me what I was billed for at XM.  What was I just billed for?  What were you billed for?  Yeah, I got a bill for like $200-something on my credit card.  Oh, I got that too.  What is that?  It's for radios.  Okay.  Subscriptions.  Tell them buying your Christmas gifts.  Remember when we first got here and people really didn't pay attention to us in corporate? 
[03:43:30]  No.  We were ignored completely.  And I tried calling up and actually getting maybe a couple of free radios and was so disgusted  that I couldn't get free radios even though I was an employee that I just went online and  bought them myself.  So I'm paying for them.  I pay subs every year.  And then I, you know, my brother and sister and everybody else calls me up and says, hey,  you know, it's coming up.  So I, you know, I dole out the cash.  I never, my girlfriend really wants a, like an Inno. 
[03:44:00]  A big one?  Yeah, but no, no, no.  I don't know if I want to get her one because there's a lot of replays from this year that  I don't know if I want her to hear.  Oh, my God.  Are you trying to steer her clear of the show?  Yeah.  I told her I was on fucking Scott and Todd.  I'm like, no, no, I'm Greg on Z100.  I just sound different.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, no, I don't mind.  She just sent me a text message.  You're out of TP.  I'm going to have to start using your pillowcases.  And I didn't get what that meant.  And then she wrote back, TP is toilet paper, which makes me laugh. 
[03:44:30]  She wants to, she has to shave.  Of course it is.  All right, we're going home.  All right, you guys go home.  Guys, I'll buzz you and let you know when the spot's online.  I'm working with Steve on it right now, but it's...  And a thanks to Gary Hahn, who called me around Thanksgiving, and I never got back to him  because I'm self-centered.  Nice to you.  He loves the show now.  No, I know.  It's good.  You're very happy.  We turned him around.  Hey, line of the day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout against the Russians. 
[03:45:00]  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  About what?  It's a bout.  Oh, a bout.  It's a bout.  Bout.  In Canada, do they still say it like a boot?  A boot.  It's a boot.  Silly Canada.  We are.  We love you, but like a retarded little brother.  When are we going to go to Canada?  That's what I want to know.  In the...  I want to go in the spring.  How about the summer for Montreal, the comedy festival?  Roy!  There's no summer in Canada.  I love the broadcast up there.  It's freezing up there the whole time. 
[03:45:30]  Not during the summer, it's not, Andy.  Every day, July 4th, you'll freeze your balls off.  Oh, go shit, you hat.  Roy.  Nice language for his mother.  Roy.  Roy, Roy, Roy, what's up?  Yeah.  I just wanted to call to say you guys got a lot of fans in Canada.  Thank you, Roy.  And the car crash kind of hurt.  Why?  Elo gave Canada the car crash.  Yeah, that was Elo.  Elo, you bad.  No, we love Canada.  I know.  We're dying to get up there, dude.  Listen, I have... 
[03:46:00]  I work in an office where there's five guys that have serious subscription.  I'm always defending you guys and battling that.  So I just wanted to say, hey, I love you guys.  Thank you.  And tell the other guys at the fucking methadone clinic that we say thank you.  Wow.  I reached for the drug.  Hold on, sir.  Let me just acknowledge how fucking horrible that joke was.  I reached for it, found it, and then it sucked.  Yes.  Wow-wee.  Yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  Take care.  You're like Joke Samson. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, my fucking...  My sense of humor is attached to my hair.  Fucking...  Oh, that's great.  Here's the...  Here's the...  The run-up line of the door.  What's the first sequel?  Really?  Oh, Loads of Laughs 2.  Yeah?  It was the sequel to Birth of a Nation.  Damn good one.  Very good, Anthony.  Seems like I just said that.  Here's today's line of the day. 
[03:47:00]  Let me get my shades on for this one.  Here comes the line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  Barack...  John Kerry.  Barack Hussein Obama.  Hussein.  Oh, it's over, John.  His name should be Molester Hitler Stalin.  That would be a little easier to vote for.  Stupid.  We'll remember.  Obama. 
[03:47:30]  Molester Hitler Stalin.  And you said Hitler first, by the way.  I have to credit that.  Anthony gets the answers on that one.  Because Anthony has said Hitler first.  But...  And I just...  When are you talking about?  The first day on the air?  Yeah.  Or every day after that?  Or...  First.  No, when someone said,  who do you admire?  No, I just...  You had mentioned Hitler.  Hitler being a bad name for it.  I think it was you.  It wasn't Eric.  All right, listen.  Our XM commercial is going to be online very soon.  I'm very psyched about that.  Very...  Homeless shopping spree Saturday at the Short Hills Mall.  Much better than I thought, by the way.  The XM commercial. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, yes.  It really looks good.  The way they...  Let's just say the way it was done in Final Cut did a nice job.  Yes.  Definitely.  So join us at the Short Hills Mall Saturday when the homeless...  Join us, why don't you?  And listen for my Dell laptop.  My brand new Dell laptop.  Possibly having an aluminum baseball bat.  Sailed through it on the air.  A week and a half old.  Unless some help comes through.  I'm beyond caring.  Or are you just beyond?  Beyond caring.  I've reached that point.  Bring it in tomorrow.  Well, let's not rush things.
