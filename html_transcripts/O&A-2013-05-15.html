<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an enthusiastic discussion about the launch of their new podcast.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, detailed the podcast's format: approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes long, blending new and archived material, culminating in "the Opie and Anthony nugget."  They highlighted its availability on iTunes and via RSS feed, expressing excitement about gaining direct access to listener data, unlike their Sirius XM experience.  A significant portion of this initial segment focused on promoting E-Rock's song "Piggin' Out" and Coke Logic's animated piece "Drunk Jimmy."  Norton's tardiness prompted playful ribbing, with a brief mention of listener Mongo.  A heated conversation ensued on racial issues in America, sparked by a reported assault on a white family allegedly perpetrated by black individuals and the subsequent lack of hate crime charges.  This discussion involved strong opinions on racial dynamics, crime statistics, and perceived media bias, punctuated by a call from LG Rock offering a personal perspective.  The Knicks' playoff performance and Opie's views on Carmelo Anthony were also briefly touched upon.  The segment concluded with plans to restart their t-shirt business and a humorous anecdote about Opie's son's reaction to their accountant, Barry, who has a shaved head.  The hosts also engaged in a somewhat frustrating attempt to rearrange the studio's television placement.

The show continued with a caller complaining about the shrinking size of Randy Taylor sausage rolls.  This was followed by a humorous "Primetime Sam Roberts and one question" segment featuring a pretend David Hasselhoff interview, limited to the question of his shirt color.  A comedic music promo for the fictional album "Sitting and Singing, the Handicap Hits" and a skit portraying the dysfunctional married couple Voss and Bonnie followed.  The hosts then discussed Will Smith's son's desire for emancipation and the challenges faced by child stars seeking independence.  This transitioned into a lengthy and detailed "shit your pants" story from George Brett, prompting further anecdotes from the hosts and a caller about similar embarrassing experiences.  A discussion about individuals paying for others' parking meters and the ensuing legal battles with city authorities ensued, evolving into a rant about the unfairness and revenue-generating nature of parking tickets, especially for delivery drivers.  The hosts offered humorous commentary and speculated on potential solutions.  The upcoming OJ Simpson court hearing, Black Sabbath's new album, and the popularity of Vine videos, with the hosts showcasing some of their own, were also discussed. A caller shared a story about leaving college due to excessive parking tickets. The segment ended with further commentary on the hosts' celebrity encounters and friendships, notably contrasting their positive relationship with Bob Saget against their more distant interactions with John McEnroe.

A chaotic exchange between the hosts marked the beginning of another segment, involving a computer malfunction, accusations of sabotage ("Sam just fucked you!"), and angry outbursts ("Turn off the fucking computer, asshole").  This led to a discussion about a bet concerning staying awake during a *Star Trek* movie and the subsequent heartburn experienced by one host, and the merits of chocolate-covered frozen bananas.  They again promoted their new podcast on iTunes, mentioning upcoming guests Jeffrey Tambor and Jim Norton’s Black Sabbath song choice ("God is Dead"), followed by a lengthy playing of the song punctuated by humorous interruptions. The segment included a clip from a previous show featuring Joe Piscopo, promotional material mentioning interviews with Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro (including a comedic short clip), and further discussions about the hosts’ relationships with celebrities.  They lamented their inability to utilize footage of interactions with famous people, using a hypothetical video of Daniel Craig shooting a gun as an example.  A call from Colin Quinn followed, discussing his upcoming show, his appearance on *Wendy Williams*, and anecdotes about his interactions with Opie and Anthony, filled with crude humor.  They promoted Quinn's show again, highlighting his work ethic and creative process.  A call from Ethan recounted a surreal experience involving a visit from Steve Perry of Journey, including a voicemail message from Perry himself.  The call's humorous highlight was Ethan's repeated mispronunciation of Neil Peart's name, leading to extended comedic riffing.  The segment concluded with the surprising announcement of an upcoming in-studio appearance by Roger Daltrey.

Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, appeared as an in-studio guest, primarily discussing his charity, Teen Cancer America, focusing on improving cancer care for teenagers. He detailed the inadequacies of the current system and the foundation's work in establishing specialized units in hospitals, mentioning collaborations with other musicians.  The hosts' initial reaction to Daltrey’s arrival was marked by excited comments on his short stature ("He's tiny," "He's three feet tall"), followed by frustrations with technical issues preventing them from saving photos with him.  There was also discussion of The Who's music and a joking reference to the lyric "Hope I die before I get old." Following Daltrey's departure, the show devolved into extended complaints about the technical difficulties, interspersed with jokes and banter. This segment included listener calls to Jim Norton's advice show, covering addiction, STDs, relationship issues, writer's block, and dealing with a friend's drug use.  The segment concluded with promotions for the Opie and Anthony podcast and a live Rotgut show.

The final segment featured Jim Norton answering listener calls. Topics included the ethical implications of watching a movie directed by someone accused of child molestation (referencing Roman Polanski), HPV and its link to cancer (with Dr. Steve providing medical information), marital intimacy issues after childbirth, sobriety and dealing with addicts (using Kevin Hart's recent DUI as an example), sex addiction, and the ethical complexities of dating a friend's ex-wife.  The segment was characterized by frank and often crude discussions of sex, addiction, and various social issues, with numerous callers sharing personal stories and seeking advice from Norton and Dr. Steve.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  It's not a fun, expensive.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down, Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  Who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it? 
[00:01:00]  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road! 
[00:01:30]  Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga!  Oh, it's the fucking, uh, the ONA choo-choo.  Choo-choo!  Pulling out of the station.  Press the button, pull the chain, out comes the chocolate choo-choo train.  Remember that.  Yeah, we were talking, uh, podcast, just before the show.  Oh, boy.  We're a bunch of weirdos, man. 
[00:02:00]  Well.  We have a very successful satellite radio show.  And we're more excited about a podcast that will definitely do less numbers than our satellite  radio show.  Exactly.  But we're all about this dumb podcast that starts today.  It's our foray into the podcast world.  Why is that?  Because we've wanted to do it for so long, and we finally get the opportunity.  Well, we talked about it in the meeting with Scott Greenstein.  We're like, look, not that we're bored, but we want, like, to look forward to new and exciting 
[00:02:30]  things.  Right.  Next week, they're allowing us to do Morse code.  Yeah.  Which I'm very excited about.  Our dot, dot, dash, dash, dash, dot, dot, dot show.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  Fantastic.  But the podcast will be available starting today.  Every Wednesday, we're going to be uploading around an hour, hour and 15 minutes.  We're trying to figure out what the best amount of time is.  Because I know when I'm listening to podcasts, if they're over an hour and a half, I don't  listen to episodes.  You start getting a little jittery. 
[00:03:00]  Except for Joe Rogan.  I'll say that every time.  Yeah.  Joe Rogan, you know, he gets a pass.  He pulls you into that world of hallucinations.  And, yeah, where time stands still.  Right.  Where the hot dog is talking to you.  You know.  But other guys, no offense.  If it's a little over, you know, if it starts pushing an hour and a half, a little longer,  I actually, I skip and I find all our pals that are doing about an hour.  Yep.  And I go through those.  You know why you might be able to do an hour, 15, hour and a half?  Because the bits will be different. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to be different bits jumping around.  And people have more patience for different bits than they would one long form thing.  Right, right.  Yeah, I think that's a, well, I think that's a mistake a lot of the podcast guys are doing,  to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we want to work in some of the older material.  You know, we got about eight years of satellite radio material, so we want to grab some of  that shit from the archives.  And then we definitely want to focus on, you know, two or three brand new bits a week as well.  You know, it's great.  And then, don't forget the Opie and Anthony nugget. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, the nugget.  And people hate the Opie and Anthony nugget.  No one likes a nugget.  No.  They like what it means, but they don't like that we're calling it the Opie and Anthony nugget.  Anytime you hear nugget, all you think of is, hey, I flushed the toilet.  Why is that still there?  Yeah.  That lone holdout for a nugget.  You know, at the end of the podcast, there'll be blah, blah, blah, follow us on Twitter,  blah, blah, blah, radio show, blah, blah, blah, all that crap.  And then after that, we'll just be an Opie and Anthony nugget.  Nugget.  It could be an E-Rock fat song. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  It could be Jimmy doing Chip.  It could be Anthony singing.  I don't know.  Sure.  We'll figure it all out.  A nugget.  But those dumb little nuggets that pop up.  Maybe some of that cool production that Troy and the guys put together.  Yes.  And Sam and Travis and E-Rock.  So, the whole gang.  But I guess iTunes, it's uploading now, but it takes iTunes a while to recognize it.  So, what does that mean?  Well, it just means that we're uploading the first official podcast. 
[00:05:00]  Right now, right?  Right now.  Sam and Sal are doing it right now.  Oh, boy.  It'll be available for RSS users almost immediately, I guess.  What's this future talk?  Yeah, what's an RSS?  Who the hell knows?  Oh, my goodness.  It sounds dangerous.  RSS.  I think you took it lunch as far as I'm concerned.  Here it comes, Sam.  And iTunes, it just takes a little while for it to recognize it.  How long does it take iTunes?  We got a podcast.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The first official one is up there?  Oh, yeah.  Not the test one that people ended up enjoying anyway? 
[00:05:30]  Gone.  That one's gone, and now the first official.  So, what's it going to be on iTunes?  So, this is number one officially, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Podcast number one.  The real podcast number one is now up.  Okay.  And the old one is gone.  Now, can people get it right now?  Yeah.  Not on iTunes.  How long does it take for iTunes to recognize that there's a new podcast available?  That's all on iTunes.  Hopefully, this is early in the morning.  It'll be easier, but it could take a couple hours on iTunes.  Oh, a couple hours.  All right.  I just posted it on Facebook.  You put it on our Facebook?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know if there's a new tab we can add, but... 
[00:06:00]  Well, can we tweet it?  Yeah.  How do we tweet it?  Well, there's a...  An official link?  Yeah, there's like a temporary website that our podcast server sets up, and the RSS feed  to anybody who doesn't use iTunes is on our Facebook page, so you can subscribe that way  now.  So, if they subscribe to the RSS feed, where are they getting it from?  It's the same place, iTunes.  It's just if you don't use iTunes, you can just plug in an RSS URL.  Right.  That's for the Droid.  Droid. 
[00:06:30]  You need an RSS to upload it to iTunes, but you don't need iTunes to get it off the RSS.  Okay.  But we also have a very cool...  We don't have any place to embed it, but we have a very cool embeddable player.  Embeddable?  What's that mean?  Like if we had a website.  If we had a website, it would be there.  So, if any of you fans want to embed it, I'll send you the link.  Embed!  Yeah, let's make this thing huge.  It's up on our Facebook page, facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  I like the fact that I'd rather people go to iTunes, you know. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  So we get some nice numbers.  Using, get the subscription up.  Right.  I was going to say, you know, the best part about this is that for so long, no one will  tell us numbers.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  And for this, we can see all the numbers we want and where people are downloading it.  It could be good or bad.  Exactly.  You see three fucking hung feet.  A hundred people in Australia downloaded the first podcast.  What?  That's just...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We don't give numbers.  These motherfuckers have never given us a number. 
[00:07:30]  Who's this?  We have no...  Sounds pretty good.  I'll log these guys.  We have no clue how many listeners we have.  People ask me all the time.  I don't know.  It's cool to see...  I just tell them 10 mil.  That's it.  It's a nice round number.  I'm like, yeah, I think it's 10 mil.  Nice round number.  It could be less than a million.  I don't know.  No, it's not.  How pretty that is.  No?  That's good.  No, I've gotten too many emails from...  I get a lot of emails from Australia.  And Keith Robinson went over there and he goes, you guys should go over there because every 
[00:08:00]  radio guy knows you and talks about the show.  How weird is that?  Australia.  I think they're good at...  Louis said that they're all good at taking stuff down there because people don't sell stuff  in Australia.  Yeah, right.  So they're all good at being pirates, but they'll pay for it if they can.  That's cool.  Well, the podcast is free.  I want to pet a koala bear.  And I want you to.  I hear they're vicious.  Exactly.  So do I.  I want you to shook it, shook it, shook it, shook it, shook it as he opens your stomach  with his claws.  So what's the easiest way to tweet this so we can get the word out even more? 
[00:08:30]  On Twitter.  Yeah.  Just say what?  Go to iTunes and fucking...  Yeah, or we can...  We can make a tiny URL, right?  Once it's on iTunes, we can just tweet the iTunes link.  And then it'll go straight to iTunes.  What about the people that don't want to go to iTunes or can't?  Yeah, can we make like a tiny URL for the RSS feed?  Yeah, you can just go to the Facebook page.  Or SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Oh, please.  No one uses that website.  That's good.  Well, let's keep them out of it as much as possible. 
[00:09:00]  Exactly.  Like give them traffic.  They got it front and center.  Go to our Facebook page or whatever.  Exactly.  They got it front and center?  Yeah, see?  Opie and Anthony Podcast.  There's a link for the RSS.  There's a link for iTunes.  Very cool.  What's this week's nugget?  This week's nugget is snacks.  I'm so tan.  Oh, we went with snacks?  Yeah.  I thought we were going with the brand new one.  Well, I left it up to...  Piggin' Out?  I left it up to Sal to either do snacks or Piggin' Out.  Oh, boy.  And Sal was with me.  I like Piggin' Out, man.  I really like Piggin' Out. 
[00:09:30]  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  Well, since it's not on the podcast, should we just play it?  Yeah, I think people might know what we're talking about.  E-Rock, would you be okay with that?  E-Rock.  E-Rock, would you be okay with that?  For E-Rock.  E-Rock's ungrateful, man.  He really is.  We get all this attention.  And love.  He just gets mad about it.  Look at all the various pictures of E-Rock in front of the songs on his page.  He's shoving shit in his face.  I know Sean F. a little bit. 
[00:10:00]  He doesn't mean any harm.  Oh, it's all love.  He just found his niche.  He just found his niche with the radio show.  Remember the fucking...  Yeah.  The blonde hair.  Mr. E-Rock.  Where's Piggin' Out?  Yeah, let's play Piggin' Out by Sean F.  I love Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  It always seems like E-Rock's always Piggin' Out.  His style is hanging out.  From all his Piggin' Out. 
[00:10:30]  Seems he's always fucking Piggin' Out.  Piggy.  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  While watching his cartoons, he's always Piggin' Out.  When watching Doctor Who, he's always Piggin' Out.  His tits look like balloons from all that Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  While watching Fraggle Rock, he's always Piggin' Out. 
[00:11:00]  While playing Bioshock, he's always Piggin' Out.  He just can't see his cock from all his Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  E-Rock is Piggin' Out.  E-Rock is Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  Piggin' Out.  E-Rock is Piggin'.  Oh.  Is he smiling? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, boy.  No.  No.  Stand your palate.  The talking part is Spence.  Snacks.  You guys are talking about snacks.  Oh, no.  Let's leave that for the end of the podcast.  That's the online exclusive.  That's the nugget.  We don't mess with the Opie and Anthony nuggets.  You don't want to pop a nugget now.  No, fucking no, man.  And before there's any controversy about what E-Rock song was picked for the first podcast,  keep in mind, there'll be podcast after podcast.  Lots of room for nuggets.  This is the only podcast.  We should also acknowledge Coke Logic today. 
[00:12:00]  He animated Drunk Jimmy.  Yeah.  Did a very good job with it.  Is that up on the Facebook page yet there, Iraq?  It will be.  It will be in a minute or two here.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Like the page.  We put all the visual shit up there for you that we talk about on the show every morning.  But Coke Logic really, really did a great job with this.  Drunk Jimmy.  I like that he's added this to it, too.  Yeah.  The guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man? 
[00:12:30]  You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  I'm just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  What?  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen, as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem. 
[00:13:00]  Well, Mongo the Trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fucking!  Where's Gary?  Fuck him!  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:13:30]  Fuck you, I'm fine.  Do you know that do what I do?  Do you know where that comes from?  Is when I was a teenager, I used to hang out with Dean.  Dean died.  But I used to, yeah, Dean was my friend who would get messed up and he was drinking before  any of us.  And he was a bad influence.  My mom didn't want me hanging out with Dean like when I was 15.  But I remember Dean's philosophy was, I just do what I do.  Oh.  And I said that to my parents.  I just do what I do.  And they're like, what does that mean?  And I'm like, you're quoting Dean? 
[00:14:00]  I do what I do.  They were so irritated that I took that as a teenage philosophy.  That is a dumb philosophy.  Yeah.  I just do what I do.  Man.  I don't like the Coke Logic fucking Aged Star animations.  Yeah.  What the hell is he doing?  Keep us young in the animation world.  Yeah.  He's aging them.  He aged us a little bit.  Really?  I don't see Bart Simpson getting any older.  No, man.  Come on.  Give us a break.  Cartoon.  Help us out.  You can at least stay young in cartoons. 
[00:14:30]  He'd decide to age us a little bit.  Yeah, really?  A little too accurate.  I don't like that.  All right.  So that's very exciting with the podcast, man.  Oh, yeah.  We're really, really excited about it.  We just like anything that's new and different and exciting.  Yes.  And thanks to everyone who's getting the word out.  I see you on Twitter.  They're pushing it big time.  Oh, yeah.  More, yeah.  All right.  Quite exciting.  Quite exciting.  Mm-hmm.  Into the realm. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  I had to meet with Barry yesterday.  Our money guy.  Our money guy.  He's our money guy.  The money man.  Barry.  Hi, Barry.  And I told my kid that my friend was coming over and he's a monster.  Oh, what the fuck?  So then he hit from Barry because he really thought he's a monster.  You could fucking... 
[00:15:30]  Don't you understand?  Oh, I love it.  Your children are impressionable.  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  You told him that.  Well, Barry shaved his head, too.  So he looks like he could be some kind of evil villain in a fucking Spider-Man movie or  something.  You know when people shave their head and it looks like, you know, hey.  Yeah.  That's a good look for you.  Yeah.  Not so much for Barry.  He should grow it back.  Should he get a toop?  Did he have some problems up there?  I don't even know.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was fine.  When you're, you know, when you're an accountant like that, you know, or a finance guy. 
[00:16:00]  If you're a finance guy and you're a...  I think you could pull it off.  You could go with the baldy head.  The baldy head?  Well, no.  I mean like the horseshoe ball.  Yeah.  Don't shave it all.  A little bit wispy on top thing.  You could do that.  It goes with the combination with the finance guy.  You know.  Yeah, but he decided, you know, to shave it off.  That's it.  I just told my kid he's a monster.  That my friend Barry's a monster.  And he hid from him?  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  Did he ask, like, why he's a monster and why he's your friend? 
[00:16:30]  Nah.  I'd be like, why do you invite monsters off?  No, no, no.  He just kind of ran away.  Ran away.  Kind of peeked in every once in a while while Barry was boring the hell out of everybody in my house yesterday.  Yeah.  That finance shit will fucking put you to sleep.  It just rattles you.  I like getting all the big points out and then, you know, there's the door.  Right, exactly. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Man, I was like, I fucking sleep by 1130.  Really?  It's amazing.  I didn't nap after work.  I was doing stuff.  I had to, like, to be constructive.  And then I just fucking was like, oh, my God, I'm exhausted.  Wow.  Went to sleep.  But then still, even going to bed early, that alarm went off.  Oh, my.  First, I woke up a little early, before the alarm.  You know when you wake up, it's still dark out.  And then you're looking at the clock and you go, come on, like 230. 
[00:17:30]  You roll for, come on, 230.  It's like you're rolling the dice, man.  Come on.  And I looked and it was like a quarter to five.  That's like the worst feeling.  Fuck, man.  There's no time to go back to sleep.  I actually fist pump.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I look at the clock and go, it's only 2 a.m.?  2 a.m.?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I roll over for another 2 a.m.  I got a whole other night's sleep.  Yep.  Right there.  You're so right.  But if you roll over and see 445, you're like, oh, my.  And you've got to stay up.  Might as well get up now. 
[00:18:00]  And I had Channel 11 on locally, so, of course, it was like, and I'm lying.  Oh, let me tell you what my opinion is.  What was he talking about this time?  Just everything that they report on the news.  It's like he's an intrusion on the news.  Right.  I don't understand why they have that guy on there.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Lino, Lino, Lino.  I can't stand that.  Yeah.  But so that was on.  I'm just like, you know, I can't go back to sleep.  And then I get the Kenny call.  Are you awake? 
[00:18:30]  Yes, Kenny.  Thank you.  You got to get up.  But still, even though I got a good night's sleep, I wake up in the first thing again.  What could I say?  What could I say to not come in?  Oh, I know.  How could I just take the day?  We have it easy.  I know.  As much as, I'll speak for myself, as much as I bitch, I know I have it easy.  Yeah.  It's just that initial, it's just like, it's Pavlovian.  When you wake up, you just, it's a natural reaction to want to stay asleep. 
[00:19:00]  I never understood when, you know, you read about, I don't know, your favorite rock band  and they bitched and complained and had problems.  I never understood any of that.  Yeah.  Until I started doing this with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Now I get it.  The ups and downs and all around.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You want a quick update on the podcast?  Yeah.  If you have an iPhone, you have the podcast app on the iPhone. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  If you're subscribed and you refresh it, it'll be there for you.  That new podcast will be there.  What?  Nice.  If you subscribe on the iPhone app.  Very cool.  But how did they get the tape so quickly?  Well, the iPhone app.  From the mail.  That'll refresh quickly.  But just to be on the actual iTunes on your computer deal is what takes a little bit of time.  I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  It's all Greek to me.  All I know is you plug it in, you play it, you listen, you have a couple laughs, you go to work. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, you RSS feed.  Get it.  Give me the record.  What's that?  Some kind of a boat?  The RSS feed.  Get it?  I do, yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  I'm going to subscribe.  I don't subscribe to any podcast, but that's what you're going to.  Yeah.  I got all our pals on my phone.  It's nice and easy.  Yeah.  Refresh.  And the next thing you know, like Bill Burr's latest podcast pops up.  What do you use? 
[00:20:30]  You do your...  And Phil Hendry.  And I got Voss on here.  And Bob Kelly.  And Weird Medicine.  What app do you use?  I use...  You use Podcast.  I just use Beyond Pod.  Podcast.  Yeah.  Apple makes it.  I got Florentine.  Look, I can tell you.  I got more stories.  I got Penn Sunday School.  I got the Joe Rogan Experience.  I got Marc Maron.  Do you listen to them?  Maybe some of these guys will promote our podcast now.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't think so. 
[00:21:00]  I don't listen to all these weekly, but they're all there with their latest podcast, and I pick and choose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think our friends will help promote our podcast?  I hope so.  We've done a lot of promoting over the years for our pals.  Very territorial.  It is, right?  In the podcast world.  Yes.  Well, now it's time to fucking pony up and thank the boys.  Right.  Yeah.  I want to see some good numbers.  Some good clicking today.  Yeah.  You watch what happens if you start knocking people out of their precious top ten spots. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, boy.  No kidding.  Oh, boy.  You don't think they're going to promote, right?  Persona non grata.  E-Rock comment?  They're going to want you to come on their podcast in order for you to...  Ah, that's true.  I think I got time for that.  I got time for that.  Skype in.  I got my own podcast.  Yeah, I think you're going to make some waves in the podcast world.  People are going to be upset.  They get their satellite radio thing.  Why are they trampling on our shit?  Right.  It's like Seinfeld going on public access television. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Why the fuck?  What are you doing?  What are you doing, bro?  Help us out.  I think next we're going to get back into the t-shirt business.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I was talking to Anthony that we should probably get back into the t-shirt business.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's been a while.  Get back in there.  Just because of that dumb video I posted with Alan getting his eyebrows shaved, he has an  Opie and Anthony shirt on, and I couldn't believe how many people, like, how do I get  one of those?  And those were just made by the company, right?  Shave your eyebrows.  A few laying around.  Yeah, we got them in the office.  We give them away for free.  I just don't know. 
[00:22:30]  They want a purchase.  Yeah.  They probably prefer free, but...  Yeah, free's good.  I mean, when we're out and about, we throw free all around.  Right.  People also don't mind, you know, just paying a few bucks for a shirt.  Yeah.  So I guess we'll go back into the t-shirt business, too.  Yeah.  And then supposedly they're cleaning the studio for us.  That's nice.  See positive stuff today.  I think new rug coming in.  New rug?  New rug.  And two garbage cans.  I like two garbage cans.  Two garbage cans.  Three.  We're back to the standard garbage pail configuration that we had earlier. 
[00:23:00]  Thank God.  By the way, all my stuff from yesterday, still in the wastebasket, and I still have plenty  of room.  Plenty of room.  I didn't need that giant...  You could go the week.  I'm going to the Knicks game, fucking garbage pail.  Right.  I wonder if you removed or reconfigured those TVs somehow.  You'd have a lot more room there, man.  Now you're...  Yeah, they're popping out a little too much.  Throw them into the corner a little more.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  All the way in the corner.  What, my love?  The mounts are all the way in the corner. 
[00:23:30]  But can't...  Do those mounts move?  Yeah, it's a swinging arm.  Can we swing them right now?  We could try.  Don't mean a thing.  I will laugh if this whole time we could have swung them closer into the corner.  Oh, I was going to do that.  That's okay.  No, go, Jimmy.  Let's see if they swing.  No, Edgar, move it.  Edgar is just shuffling over there, taking forever.  And no, it's not broken.  Edgar, move it. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God, Edgar.  Edgar, you're tilting it.  Oh, so they do move.  Oh, my God.  We could have taken care of this.  Oh, my God.  We could have taken care of this a long time ago.  This is going to make the room look a lot bigger.  Look at this.  They push right into the corner.  Why were they sticking out like that?  We just gained five feet.  Sticking out.  Wow.  Look how much bigger the place looks.  The place is giant. 
[00:24:30]  It's like Howard's studio now.  That is amazing.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  Damn.  Can we even move them further into the corner?  That's about it.  No, I'm going to say I might go.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't we do this years ago?  But now they're just so far away.  The back of the TV is hitting the wall.  Right?  All right.  But that...  Edgar!  You're pulling it the wrong way.  Shidip.  Shidip.  I fucking hate Edgar. 
[00:25:00]  He's a dick.  Oh, this one's not behaving.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's a big problem.  Oh, my God.  Crawling for behave!  Wow, look at that.  All right.  Just gained a few feet.  That's wonderful.  Look at that.  It's still crooked, though.  That's why everybody else is nuts and you don't care.  No.  No, I don't care.  Who gives a flying fuck, Jimmy?  Crooked bothers you, Jimmy?  Sometimes.  Sometimes, no.  Yeah, crooked doesn't bother me.  I don't care, no.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  Very good. 
[00:25:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Should we check our podcast numbers?  That's all we're going to do now.  Now we lost that table.  It's crap.  No.  Just because it's new.  It's exciting.  I love it.  I was telling Greenstein, when we worked at XM, every once in a while, there was a little  thing that we looked forward to, whether it was a visit to Washington, or they threw  us on planes for a poker tournament in L.A., or a Vegas trip, or whatever.  Yeah.  That was all fun. 
[00:26:00]  All fun.  New stuffs.  New stuff.  Good stuff.  Yeah.  There it is.  What else is going on?  Well.  I was trying to watch the Knicks last night, and they're just beyond frustrating.  They're completely imploding in the playoffs.  Who are they losing to?  Pacers.  Pacers got them three games to one.  And then I tweeted that, you know, the Knicks will never win a championship with Carmelo  Anthony, and oh boy, people trying to beat me up. 
[00:26:30]  He's a great player, but he doesn't play well with others.  Oh.  And then, of course, no one else is scoring.  I understand that.  That guy.  And I will be proven right, because years will go by without a championship with Carmelo  Anthony as a Knick.  He's a great player, but he doesn't give a fuck about anyone else on that goddamn court.  But those are the tweets I've been getting. 
[00:27:00]  Now, I don't know why.  What?  Well, people tweet me.  About the Knicks?  Yeah.  But without anything else in the tweet, not even as an aside, it'll be like, Anthony.  And it'll be, do you see the Knicks?  And then it just talks about, and I'm like, I am so not a basketballer.  It works both ways.  I get your racist tweets.  Do you?  Oh, okay.  People think I have the same passion as you do on certain social issues.  My racist tweets, they are tweets about society and some of the ills in this society. 
[00:27:30]  Every once in a while, I'll just write, I think you meant to send this one to Anthony.  Okay, I'll send the basketball ones to you.  Yeah, please.  Let's do it.  And then, okay.  We'll trade.  We'll trade.  All right.  That makes sense, then.  And then, of course.  Poor white family got fucking assaulted at a gas station.  Where?  By black people.  Where was that?  It was in, was it Louisiana?  The whole family?  Baton Rouge, I think.  Yeah, there was a husband, a wife, and a 14-year-old daughter. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  White family.  They pull up to a gas station.  The guy starts pumping gas.  Four blacks come up to them and say, you're in the wrong neighborhood.  And start kicking the guy's ass.  He goes, you ain't going to get out of here.  And start kicking the man's ass.  Fucking knocked him out.  Unconscious.  The wife comes over to help him.  She gets fucking blindsided in the side of the fucking head.  Knocked out unconscious.  The 14-year-old daughter comes out to help her family now.  Comes out of the car.  And she gets fucking pummeled. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  I wonder where that is in the, I don't see that.  It's nowhere.  And no hate crime charges filed against the black people.  Is there a video?  No, no video.  But it's not one of those things that we're, it's, no one's saying this didn't happen.  I mean, it fucking happened.  They arrested the people.  But they are not being charged with a hate crime.  It's, it's, it's exactly what Fat Nick did.  Fat Nick didn't kill anybody.  He, he fucking, this guy was in the, in the fucking hospital. 
[00:29:00]  Unconscious.  He woke up in the fucking hospital.  And these are fucking men.  It's like, with Fat Nick, there were men.  Right, right, right.  You beat up a family.  A 14-year-old girl.  You, you fucking beat up.  It's, there's, there's just this fucking shit going on.  And the double standard, the fucking, white people have really, and it's funny to say,  obviously people laugh and stuff, but in this day and age, as a white person being assaulted  in a race, a crime, you have no recourse. 
[00:29:30]  You have no one to go to.  You can't say, hey, I'm white.  My civil rights were violated because a black person decided to attack me for no other  reason than my, my race.  But you don't have a recourse.  You can't go to anybody.  Because people laugh.  Oh, whitey, shut up.  Oh, you're so privileged.  You got no problems.  It wasn't a hate crime.  It was the, no, it's a hate crime.  Black people have, there are a certain group of black people.  There is a, a cultural problem where, um, uh, white people can be assaulted with impunity. 
[00:30:00]  It's amazing.  Thank you.  That's my racist rant for today.  Were they, um, in the wrong neighborhood though?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Why were they in the wrong neighborhood?  Because they were white, see?  And it's a black neighborhood.  Right.  Uh, which of course, you know not to go in.  But if a black person wanders into a white neighborhood and anyone even says anything, there will be a  march down Main Street, uh, for the, the people's rights. 
[00:30:30]  You're not wrong.  So, um, yeah, of course, but, but, but I'm racist for saying it.  The daughter was also punched in the face.  I'm reading an article on it real quick.  Punched in the face.  It's terrible.  And the way they're wording it so carefully in the press.  Of course!  Tiptoe!  They said, uh, just something about a man, uh, sorry, uh, Stubbs said a man wearing a pink  shirt was in line trying to pay for gas when Donald Dickerson, blah, blah, blah,  started making fun of him.  Uh, and then they mentioned the victim's race, but not the perpetrators. 
[00:31:00]  The defendant, Dickerson, approached the white male victim.  Uh-huh.  They won't say, no, blah, it's, and it's, this is, and black people who complain about  this, it's not complaining, oh, black people are the only ones committing crimes.  It's the way the press reports it that's so angering.  It's not even the crime that, the crime is the crime.  Right.  It's the way the press, oh, they should fucking all be killed.  They, the press will coddle black people.  Uh, it, it's unbelievable the extent the press will go to, to try not to offend and try this 
[00:31:30]  inclusion.  And let's not, the, the fucked up thing is people were getting upset that so many black  people were being portrayed as criminals on the news.  That's it.  And, and, and sorry, there's a large percentage, uh, it's, it's disproportionate to the population  of this country of black people committing crimes.  Now, whatever reason you want to give for that, I'm not getting into it right now, but  let's just say it's a, a larger percentage than it should be for their percent of the 
[00:32:00]  population.  Uh, so the press is getting shit.  Why are you showing so many black people committing crimes?  So now they still show it.  They just don't report that it was black people.  How the fuck is that fixing anything?  Which sometimes it doesn't matter.  Like if there's a guy that just robs someplace and they catch him and you're caught, eh,  it's an armed robbery.  The race is not relevant.  Right.  Or if two guys have a fight over a girl, the race isn't really relevant.  Right.  If you want to know what it is, just go to the FBI stats and you could find out all that  shit.  But like you said, you're absolutely right. 
[00:32:30]  They caught him, whatever.  But if you're, if there's somebody that is out there, uh, that they're searching for,  why the fuck wouldn't you put race in there instead of just his shirt color and his  pants color, you know, the, the, the suspect is described as a six foot tall male wearing  a, let's say, if you just said black or white or Asian, you could cut down on the people  that you would, you know, be looking for, looking for unbelievable.  They, they coddle, they, they, they cradle and rock a bye baby, uh, black people in the 
[00:33:00]  news.  It's, it's stunning.  Not a hate crime.  Not a hate crime.  Why would it be?  Why would it be?  That's, by the way, that's a sickness in white people.  It is.  It's this inability to see that there are black people that just don't like white  people.  Yes.  And that's, that's all white people's.  It's almost like the guilty parents not realizing that the child or the people that they see as  children are fucking angry at them and don't like them. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  And white people don't want to admit to themselves that there are black people that just don't  like you.  Do you understand also people have said black people cannot be racist because to be racist  you need a power base in order to oppress people?  Yeah.  You've got it, black people.  You have a power base.  You have the ability with, with that R word to fucking ruin people's lives.  Not mine.  Ha ha.  But you have the ability to ruin people's lives.  There is a power base.  There is a, a, a, an ability now for black people to oppress white people and, and through, 
[00:34:00]  uh, uh, acts like this with these white people being beat up to intimidate, to, uh, hurt.  So yes, you have the ability to be racist, uh, and to commit race crimes.  And that's the, but that's a lie anyway.  You don't need to have a power base to be racist.  Right.  I should have said that.  I was just saying what, what the fucking line is. 
[00:34:30]  A society does, or it may be, uh, to say America is anti-white is silly.  Of course not.  White people do pretty damn good here.  But as individuals, it doesn't matter what your power base is.  If you go out and commit a crime of violence against somebody because they're gay or because  they're white or because they're black, it's a hate crime.  That's the end of it.  You don't need a power base for that.  And people who say you do are just building in an excuse as to why one crime is this, but,  but the reverse crime or the same crime with the other shoes is not.  You should see the amount of, if you look at the stats, the amount of hate crimes committed, 
[00:35:00]  um, uh, against black people, the, the stats and against white people.  It's, it's unbelievable how many more are against black people than white people.  Yet the, the black on white crime level outnumbers the white on black crime level like you can't  even fucking imagine.  So you're telling me that all of those are just based on, you know, economics, that, that 
[00:35:30]  they're trying to, uh, uh, just rob somebody, that it's never based on the fact that the  white person appears weaker, um, that it's a good crime of opportunity.  Uh, and, and race comes into race comes into it.  They are chosen because they are white.  It's also though, but there's an arrogance to it.  Like, you know, when you think of the Germans in World War II, nobody thinks the Germans  were stupid.  Like everyone looks at the Germans like, wow, they were terrible, but they were fucking  pretty brilliant.  Terrible, but smart.  Right.  There's a really weird intelligence that people give with racism or racial motivation. 
[00:36:00]  And for some reason they look at black criminals as unable to have those motives.  They think that black people again are just so a and B like money take, like they don't  think that black people can have any other hidden motivation or any other type of thought  process other than reacting to stimuli.  And that's, that's, that is such a fucking arrogant way to, it's like white people are not 
[00:36:30]  the only ones capable of the thought process necessary to create racial animosity or make  racial, uh, decisions good or bad.  There's also the, uh, okay.  A black person robs a white person.  Um, it's well, uh, you know, you've raised in poverty.  It's the systematic racism over the years, but every excuse is geared towards the poor black  person had a hard life. 
[00:37:00]  We've had this racism in this country.  They need the money.  Where else are they going to go to?  They can't get jobs to get, there's all this excuse except instead of maybe sometimes he's  just a fucking prick who's out trying to make an easy buck and sees an easy target.  That it's, there's always excuses.  You know, we're lucky to have black friends that we talked to on the show that like, honestly,  like, like honest discussions and like, you know, uh, whoever they, whether it was, you  know, I got a Keith Patrice, obviously so many of these guys, everyone's like, I have 
[00:37:30]  black friends, but it's like, most people don't get to have honest racial discussions.  So it's like, I think that we're in a, we're very lucky that we're, we do that because most  people at work, like two guys sitting at the, at the office can't have the discussions  we have because God forbid you overstep, you're branded that at work, forget it.  Like you can't just say, shut up, stupid, if the guy's your supervisor, you're a fucking  asshole, what?  Are you dumb?  Look what black's doing.  Or fuck, are you white phony?  You can't say that to each other at work.  Right. 
[00:38:00]  So we're lucky we get to have these chats with people.  So I don't feel guilty.  Like the white people have this really weird, it's almost like people don't want to face  the fact they're afraid that if they admit like, yeah, there's black people that just  simply don't like us, then everything has to be examined.  And people are terrified.  There's a real white guilt with, is, is the guilt of the ruling class, the guilt of doing  well.  Where do the, where do the white guilt start?  It's like probably way, way back, probably back when it really should have been there.  Like, you know what I mean? 
[00:38:30]  When things were really, but why does it continue?  Uh, because people are in a way that, well, we're, we're still benefiting from all those  things that were done back then.  How ridiculous is that?  There's not, there's a point to it in some ways.  I don't think there is at all.  I think there's a little bit of a point to the, you know, like it's not what it was,  but there's a point to the fact that white people still benefit from the way society was  set up.  Most of the people that are here now, um, what their, their relatives weren't even here  during the slave trade. 
[00:39:00]  And, and, and, and, and it's, it's ridiculous to the, most people like, you know, you have  your grandparents came from another country, even your great grandparents came from another  country.  They had absolutely nothing to do with it.  Most of the people, uh, the, the blacks here in, in the United States have no attachment,  have less of an attachment to slavery than I have to fucking Italy.  It's, it's, it's ridiculous.  I don't mean slavery though.  They will perpetrate that.  Well, oh, oh, you're talking about what, uh, the racism that went on, Jim Crow. 
[00:39:30]  The problem with that is that was such, that was, that was not as bad as slavery, but it  was almost as bad.  It's not that long ago yet.  It's so, you need a couple more generations to pass by.  Well, absolutely.  Well, I, I don't, I don't see it getting better, but I don't see it getting, but going from the  point of, of the, that racism to, to, uh, uh, opening up opportunities and freedom and  equality.  I see Jimmy, I see it getting better.  I see Jimmy's point because, you know, if, if I knew one of my relatives was hosed into  a fucking wall and had German shepherds, you know, uh, released on them, I'd be holding 
[00:40:00]  a grudge still.  Fuck yeah.  Would you?  I don't know what the fuck my own grandfather did.  Like, like, no, I'm talking about life.  No, I, I, I knew my, my, uh, my grandma.  I'm talking about the people I, I did know that would have been alive, uh, through those  times and I know, I, I just know that I would still be holding a bit of a, a grudge.  Yeah.  I really would a little bit.  I don't know.  A little bit.  Cause here, here's, here's my point.  A lot of these crimes are being perpetrated by teens, teens. 
[00:40:30]  Do you honestly think they have this knowledge that they sat down with their grandparents and  they discussed fucking Selma?  Yeah.  I don't know.  No.  I honestly don't know.  Stop it.  They didn't.  But you see, like, this is something that, that the country complains about, about like,  well, how come in black neighborhoods is like, but by the way, and I'm not saying it's  right, but I'm just saying where it comes from.  Uh huh.  Like if someone does anybody wrong in your family, you're, you're a motherfucker about  it.  That's all.  But I'm not saying it's right.  But like I said, my own, my own grandfather could have, could have been, you know, and 
[00:41:00]  I don't know anything about my grandfathers because they, they, you know, died when I  was a, I know it.  Yeah.  Just a little nothing.  I'm sure that happened with a lot of them.  So that's why I'm only talking about my grandmother.  That's the only experience I would have.  I see it as another in a long list of excuses that are used to justify horrid behavior.  I don't, I don't think any of it should be justified, but look at something like what  bothers me when you see footage of like, and again, this is in the sixties.  Yeah, I know it's a long time ago, but I think that long ago people trying to go to 
[00:41:30]  college and the governor standing there saying, we won't let you into college.  Like, that's what this country was, or a big, a good portion of this country was until  the sixties.  How long?  All of us were born in the sixties.  How long?  Fucking long.  I think a couple of generations.  No.  I think a few more generations, unfortunately, that we're not going to be, we're not going  to be here for.  And then, and then hopefully it does get a little better.  I don't know.  I don't know if it does.  I see no fucking way to even, even acknowledge that when you're talking that the multitude 
[00:42:00]  of these horrid crimes are being committed by fucking teenagers.  When you, because, because teenagers aren't born in a vacuum and you're right, but they  don't raise, people are raised by people who are older than them.  So a big part of it is like, not much, how you, by at least 10 years, but you, you, you,  you kind of, a lot of people pick up what we learn from the people above us.  And if the people above you are uneducated because they wanted to go to college and they're 
[00:42:30]  told you can't, it's, it's, it's really hard to stop now and go, Hey, come on guys.  Why don't you value college?  When a short period of time ago, the country as a whole, uh, said, well, we're going to  college.  You go serve in the military, defend what we consider the rights that we are born inalienable  rights.  And then when you come back, we treat you like shit.  And that's the message the country gave for a long fucking time.  I have to, so we're still eating the shit from that. 
[00:43:00]  No, I have to, again, say that most of the people that are committing these horrid fucking  animalistic crimes have no clue of history.  What happened to their people?  They hear slavery and racism and use it as an excuse and to take the path of least resistance,  which is selling drugs and fucking rolling people for money.  Uh, it has, it has nothing to do with looking back and going, the reason I'm caving your  fucking head in, in this parking lot is because my fucking grandfather was hit with a fire hose 
[00:43:30]  and that German shepherds, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  It's the path of least resistance.  It's fucking laziness and it's fucking, uh, uh, excuses.  And it's this, this pass that white society gives to, uh, uh, uh, uh, certain ethnic groups  to act like fucking children.  That's part, see, it's half, I think that's half, I agree with half of that.  I think it's a lot more than half.  People, I think that people do kind of look at that as an excuse and a lot of people do 
[00:44:00]  use it as an excuse and it is the past appeal.  But the way the country handles it and the way that this, this, this, this fucking white  people guilt sickness is from a lot of that.  Like why does nobody, if people reacted in the paper the same way to this crime, it would  help cut it down a lot because it would be a lot more visible and then people would  all shrug their shoulders like you're out of your mind when you're talking.  What are you talking about?  There's no way, everything's fine.  Like Patrice said, I never met a racist, never. 
[00:44:30]  You know, when is the last white person, you know, publicly that was like, yeah, you  know, I feel this way about certain things or I have this black people say it all the  time and it's cool for them to say it.  White people don't say it.  So there's still not honesty about race coming from white people.  Well, Soledad O'Brien brought this up the other day.  She was talking about the same thing.  We should have her on, right?  I would love to interview her.  Uh, yeah, I don't think she'd come on here though.  Why?  I don't know.  It's one of those other Jack Jack show.  Oh, okay.  I don't think she would.  But she was talking about the fact that, um, you know, white people are, uh, afraid to 
[00:45:00]  talk about race.  She's a hundred percent right.  Yeah, it is.  But there's also a reason for that, that I blame, uh, the black, I blame, I blame white  people more so, but I do also blame the fact that if you do discuss race open and honestly,  you will get black, uh, leadership that will tag you as racism, as racist and, and, and  fuck with your life.  But black, black leadership is not the ones firing you. 
[00:45:30]  Black leadership are not the ones controlling the jobs.  They're not the ones running human resources.  Those are almost all white people.  Almost, Sharpton doesn't go to black people and go, fire this.  It's 90 fricking percent white people.  Oh, exactly.  So it still falls in the laps of fucking white people being phony about race and refusing  to talk about it.  And giving too much power to that.  But they're petri-  White people are petrified to talk about race.  Because they're petrified.  Because they're scared that their own secret shit is going- 
[00:46:00]  It's almost like they're trying to open a door without an odor seeping out.  And they're afraid that that odor is their own fucking racial feelings.  Hold on, we got someone really pissed off.  Let's go to LG Rock in Brooklyn.  LG Rock.  Yeah, what it do, son?  Hi, LG.  Yeah.  You want to know why I do what I do?  Why I hit motherfuckers upside the head to get my money?  Why?  Because I'm culturally motherfucking-  Listening to motherfucking Lil Wayne and all of that bullshit.  And I'm lazy. 
[00:46:30]  So, you know what?  I'm just bullshit.  And he's really right.  I'm black as a motherfucker, right?  But it's the fucking music, that Lil Wayne shit, and his little young kids.  They hear that shit, and they think it's right.  They don't know better.  You think?  I'm not-  No, because it's like rock music being blamed.  Yeah, I don't like blaming.  I think music and art and whatnot is more of a reflection.  I've always tried not to blame, you know, entertainment on this shit, but-  I think it's more a reflection than a cause of, you know, any kind of art, like movies, music. 
[00:47:00]  Because we hate to think violent video games are the reason why, you know, mostly white  kids are shooting up schools.  I think when-  We've always tried to protect that shit.  You look at rap artists and whatnot, they're just talking about what they're seeing.  They're not saying, hey, you know, do this.  They're saying, hey, this is what I see being done.  Do you think kids are influenced?  Does it perpetrate it?  I don't know.  Do you think kids are influenced by rap lyrics?  I think they are, but I don't think-  I don't think it's so much in the forefront of why they're doing what they're doing. 
[00:47:30]  It's the parents, too.  It's the young parents.  Parent.  Stop.  You put an S on the end of parents.  That's a huge problem.  75% illegitimacy rate in the black community.  Why isn't that a giant story in the news?  It's brought up as an aside.  I see it on certain shows, and they mention the statistic.  It's a horrible thing of zero responsibility being taken by the father and the mother to  raise their children in a two-parent household, which I'm not saying every household has to 
[00:48:00]  be two-parent, but when it's 75% rate, you're going to pump out fucking kids that have no  idea what a family unit is even like.  I grew up in the worst fucking part of Brooklyn.  It's like Brooklyn and Vietnam.  They call it Brooknom.  Where in Brooklyn is that?  Brooknom.  LG.  Baby, Bed-Stuy.  Oh.  Bed-Stuy?  Is that worse than Brownsville? 
[00:48:30]  Right around the corner from Biggie Smalls, right?  Yeah.  Motherfuckers dying left and right.  Single parent.  And you know what?  Like Biggie said, you got a wicked jump shot.  Are you selling crack rock?  Hell no.  I went to the military and I got out of that shit.  There you go.  And I live right now in D.C. and I make real good money.  You know what I'm saying?  Work right at the Pentagon.  Making some guap.  You know, and I never robbed a motherfucker in my life.  There you go.  See?  I like that. 
[00:49:00]  I live right now.  You look at the news.  I see that shit.  All these little guys getting locked up for the dumb shit.  They got dreads.  It's the image.  Yep.  They're being culturally consistent.  Now, you're a rarity from your neighborhood, obviously, right?  How many guys got out?  No.  And are doing well for themselves?  But look, my best friend, right?  He lived across the street.  He had his father was a court clerk.  His mother was a school teacher.  He black as a motherfucker like me.  He a lawyer right now. 
[00:49:30]  And I just surrounded myself with positive people, man.  I stayed away from that bullshit.  Motherfucker said, hey, I'm going to rob somebody.  All right.  See you later.  See, I like hearing those stories.  And people tell me all the time when I tweet about this and stuff.  They go, oh, you generalize.  And I hate when you say all black people do this.  I never say all black people.  Whenever I talk about this issue and this problem,  and it is a problem, 
[00:50:00]  I say it's a disproportionate number.  It's a giant percentage for the population percentage.  You're right, sir.  I don't agree with a lot of shit you say.  I don't either.  I said, this motherfucker fucking ran.  He don't like black people.  But I had to call a day.  Oh, I love black people.  I just like the ones that, you know, work for a living and aren't a burden on my fucking tax bill.  The problem in this case to me is, yeah, the crime is shitty. 
[00:50:30]  Who I hate for this is the press.  And they're always the ones I wind up hating because they're just simply not telling the truth about it.  I agree with you, but I am absolutely not putting all the blame on the fact that the press won't fucking speak up about the problem.  There's still the problem that has to be addressed.  Not the blame.  But, you know, black people have their crimes they commit.  And white people have their crimes they commit.  Again, whenever you hear of a kid being shot on purpose, that's normally a white guy.  A child being brutally raped and murdered, that's usually a white guy thing. 
[00:51:00]  Fucking 50 people hitting a fucking random spraying, black guy thing.  But the press just not reporting it makes me fucking crazy.  LG Rock, why do black people hate white people, in your opinion?  Because maybe not all black people.  Let's straighten that out.  All right.  Of course.  It's because, you know, the press a lot.  And then the shit that the white people did back in the day.  You know what I mean?  That shit lingers on.  It's passed on. 
[00:51:30]  We're culturally conditioned to hate them.  Oh, boy.  You know, the way I used to beat the shit out of us and slavery and all of that.  Oh, my God.  Do you remember that?  I really don't.  I know what happened.  You know what?  Everyone's got a fucking history.  And if you only went through by personal experience, only by personal experience, I know.  I don't hate white people.  I think white girls suck a mean dick to me.  They certainly do.  Oh, boy.  By the way, if we're only going by personal experience, you should have no feelings about 
[00:52:00]  this because you've never gotten beaten up by a black guy.  Meaning...  No, I was.  Well, yeah.  Well, I used to get shaken down and centralized it.  But, I mean, you don't deal with it now.  Like, your personal experience with black people hasn't been one of oppression or terrible.  And yet, you still have very strong feelings about what goes on involving other people.  No.  You know?  So, it doesn't always have to be personal experience.  No, that's true.  But...  It's easy to be influenced by shit.  I've never been in a plane crash either.  But you'd get a little jumpy.  You're on one every day. 
[00:52:30]  You get a little jumpy when you board that fucking aircraft.  You know?  Because you see things.  All right.  Although, statistically, it's a sweet trouble.  We all just got to become the same color.  Is that it?  That'll fix everything.  Oh, boy.  All right, LG.  All right.  Thanks, brother.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  We're going to hit our first break here.  Oh, I didn't tell Kenny what I wanted to eat.  He already knows.  Lugged it in his underwear. 
[00:53:00]  Lugs.  He lugs it.  All right.  We'll get into some other shit in a few minutes here.  Oh, Jacksonville, Florida this weekend.  Sold out.  Really?  No.  Not even close.  Oh, we're about to get excited.  Comedy zone.  Comedy zone in Jacksonville.  If you want.  The comedy zone.  Starting Thursday night or?  Yeah, and then the Stress Factory the week after.  Then my last two gigs.  I'm going to have to go to the Stress Factory.  Yeah, I haven't been there in a couple years.  I love Vinny's Stress Factory.  I do, too.  I won't call it Vinny Brand Stress Factory. 
[00:53:30]  Vinny Brand Stress Factory.  That's silly.  It's on the billboard.  I will not say that.  No.  Never.  Never.  It's just the Stress Factory.  Stress Factory.  Stress Factory.  You've got to call this place the Stress Factory.  You know.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Channel. 
[00:54:00]  On Sirius XM.  This little 12-ounce goddamn roll of sausage is supposed to feed your brother and me and  you, 600 pounds of mint, at least.  You get my point?  And the two girls, and the two girls, and they put it in that fucking pussy roll of sausage.  Son of a bitch.  Somebody needs their ass kicked.  Some little consumer geek-a-royd.  Fuck this shit up.  Save money.  Save money.  Save money.  Yeah.  Save money.  Save money. 
[00:54:30]  Fuck.  I'm going to eat.  God damn it.  Randy Taylor, I don't know where you people come from.  I don't know if you test your products, your quantity of your product.  Your products are very delicious.  I love your sausage for 30-something years, but I can't take and feed a family of five on  a little 12-ounce roll of sausage.  I don't mind paying you more money for your 16-ounce roll of sausage, but you don't have  it anymore.  You've got a 12-ounce roll, and you've got three men that weigh over 200 pounds apiece. 
[00:55:00]  A woman that's a little plump Scotch girl and a daughter who's 13, and you're going to  try to take a 12-ounce roll of sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and feed that, it ain't  going to work, and I'm not going to purchase your product anymore or ever again.  And as far as your 16-ounce of maple and sage, I don't eat that.  I'm not from the north.  I'm a Texas man.  Jimmy Dean sausage is for southern people to eat with the breakfast with the fried eggs  and the T-bone steaks, and I can't see going to a little 12-ounce package to feed four, 
[00:55:30]  five, six people.  And I'm not going to buy two of those 12-ounce packages.  It's because you want to downsize and charge the same goddamn price.  I'd sure like a reply, and I'd sure like you to go back to your 16-ounce package on your  regular sausage, because I'm not going to buy it.  Otherwise, ever again, I'll just have my own damn sauce made like I used to 30-something  years ago.  It's not as tasty as yours is, but it'll work. 
[00:56:00]  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we  couldn't get.  World-famous actor, singer, and alcoholic, David Hasselhoff.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with David Hasselhoff. 
[00:56:30]  David, what color shirt are you wearing?  I'm wearing a black shirt.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you very much.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the  Opie and Anthony Show.  New from Puddin' Head Records, Opie and Anthony present Sitting and Singing, the Handicap Hits.  I'm rolling with the devil.  It's all the rock you know and love, done specifically for people without leg mobility. 
[00:57:00]  Because traps like us, baby, we were born to roll.  Just because your legs don't work doesn't mean your ears don't.  Just ask Van Halen.  Hey, I wish I could jump.  I'm never gonna jump.  Might as well just sit here.  The hits just keep rolling in.  If only they could walk.  Ah, yes.  I would roll 100 miles and I would roll 500 more. 
[00:57:30]  But my hands would hurt because I'm rolling.  Get it?  I sit in the chair that you're in.  Now face north.  You roll around 90 degrees and still just sit here.  It's Sitting and Singing, the Handicap Hits from your pals at Puddin' Head Records and  the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  A marriage is... 
[00:58:00]  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all  the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He... no.  Is he bad with, like, casually loving touching?  Well, because I know he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't...  Like, hasn't figured out how to caress. 
[00:58:30]  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter  her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Wow, Rich!  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie.  And rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted. 
[00:59:00]  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I mean, not a whole thing.  The OBS show continues.  You know, parents all the same, no matter time, no place.  They don't understand that us dicks are going to make some mistakes.  So to you other kids all across the land, there's no need to argue.  You parents just don't understand.  You can dance the rap. 
[00:59:30]  Some Will Smith shit, huh?  I remember one year my mom took me school shop.  And it was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little son.  The Negro.  Oh, my goodness.  Inverse.  Mm-hmm.  This shirt costs $20.  I said, Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar.  The mix cast style was the same old thing.  My mother buying me clothes from 1963. 
[01:00:00]  And then she lost her mind.  It is the ultimate.  I asked her for Adidas, and she bought me zips.  I said, Mom, why are you doing it?  Oh, man.  Damn, that's got to be a problem.  Damn, yo.  I like this song.  No, she didn't.  Guilty Pleasure?  Mm-hmm.  Guilty Pleasure, yeah.  You don't like this song?  You don't like old school rap?  No, I kind of, it's fun, you know.  It's fun.  Will Smith's son wants to be emancipated from his parents.  Why?  I thought they all got along.  Made that proclamation. 
[01:00:30]  I thought kids did that when they hated their parents.  He wants his own house.  That's all it is.  I think he just wants to live with it.  He's just going to his teenage relationship.  He wants his own house.  He's only, how old is he?  He's 15.  He's 15, and what's this story about?  Why does he want to do this?  He's got a problem with his parents, I bet.  I don't know, man.  I think it's just one of those things where he's famous.  Little Hollywood shits get fucking all full of themselves.  He's an amazing, amazing life.  He's Will Smith's kid.  He probably just wants to get laid and feel independent.  There's probably no anger behind it. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, but you would think if Will Smith's your dad, you pretty much could do whatever  the fuck you want anyway, right?  I don't know.  Huh?  I bet he's pretty strict.  You think Will Smith is strict?  He's too busy doing his shit.  I bet he probably does.  He's like, you know, they probably open his door.  What are you doing in here?  And he's probably like, I just want to fucking bring chicks up here and bang.  Well, Will said that we generally don't believe in punishment.  From the time Jaden was five or six, we would sit down, and all he would have to do is explain 
[01:01:30]  why what he did was the right thing for his life.  Oh, that's terrible.  That's worse than punishment.  Yeah, it's fucking worse.  And then he's 15, and he wants to be out of the house already.  Yeah.  You know, Will Smith, by the way, was a great rapper.  Like, he was really underrated.  For the time?  Nah, when you look back, though, and I mean, like, yeah, it was childish stuff, some of  it was silly, but, like, he was a real natural speaker when he rapped.  It was very interesting, the way he would structure lyrics.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think he was great. 
[01:02:00]  Well, Will Smith's kid just wants his own house, like Jimmy said.  And, uh, on the other side, if the kid just wants, uh, to have command of, of his life.  Hmm.  Huh, what the fuck?  It's not good enough.  Who else got that?  Macaulay?  Did Macaulay Culkin get that?  Yeah, Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman.  Who else?  There was some broad that got it, too.  Maybe, uh, Drew Barrymore?  Was it Punky Brewster?  What about Drew?  Drew Barrymore?  She got it, right?  She wanted out.  Did Tiffany or Debbie Gibson?  Tiffany?  Debbie Gibson?  What?  Who? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Hollywood people.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think, uh, the regular, uh, Joe could get emancipated from their parents.  I remember some girl in high school talking about it.  Really?  That she was gonna be emancipated.  She was like the fuckin' stoner slut girl.  But doesn't that mean you gotta pay your own bills and shit?  Yeah.  So where are you gonna get that money from?  Exactly.  That's why we were stuck living in our, in our houses.  I'm gonna work.  I'm gonna work for a living.  Ah, what the hell.  I don't need this.  We're going to hell in a handbasket as far as I'm concerned. 
[01:03:00]  Demancipated, emaciated, what the heck do I know?  Give me my lunch pail and blow the whistle.  Lunch pail.  These kids today, they don't understand what it's like to do a hard day's work.  No?  You do.  Well, yeah.  I don't mean you.  Oh.  Figuratively me?  Yeah.  Oh.  Ah, this is a big birthday today.  Ah.  Guys, come on.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Thank you, Opie.  Oh, what?  You share a birthday with George Brett.  What?  Who's the big 6-0 today.  60? 
[01:03:30]  And the only reason I mention it is because we have that famous clip.  What clip?  I don't even know what you're talking about.  You have the George Brett clip handy, don't you, for his big birthday?  Yes, it's two clips.  I know it's two clips, and we should play every single second of the George Brett clip.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  It's a classic.  It is.  Happy birthday, George Brett.  Right side.  Back to the right.  Got them both hands.  Right side.  Go left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did. 
[01:04:00]  Love that.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom.  So bad in the car, I'm going, travel, hurry up, man.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that.  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Yeah.  Been a while?  It's been a while.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest to God, true story.  No one asked him.  Staying with Bellagio.  I went over to the Mirage for dinner, met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo's, a great little steakhouse. 
[01:04:30]  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He said, these just came in, I got to give them to you guys.  I'm eating them.  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  I had a tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel.  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby.  And all of a sudden I go, oh, fuck.  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucked.  I'm fucked.  I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this.  Water. 
[01:05:00]  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket.  Tied it around my waist.  I'm just standing there and it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks, no socks.  And I just start fucking walking.  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  Dude, that's an amazing story.  Literally, a 9-11 survivor couldn't captivate me the way that fucking story does.  He doesn't know how to tell a great story. 
[01:05:30]  He's one of the greats.  He's compelling.  But he loves to tell a good shit story, just like we love to tell a good shit story right  here.  I love how the other guy's like, nah, it's been a long time.  He goes, yeah, I'm good about twice a year.  And then he's like, nah, that hasn't happened to me in a while.  He goes, here, Zoom Vegas.  He's like, the guy didn't even ask him, so when was the last time you shit, George?  He's just volunteering the story.  Do you know how much I love a guy with a great shit-your-pants story on, like, an easy-to-read  shit-your-pants story? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wonderful.  Everyone has one, and they can't wait to tell it, to break it out.  That's only part one, right?  Yeah.  And then George Brett continues.  Then, just tell you how sick I was, tell you how sick I was, and then I'm standing outside  and I'm trying to kill my cell phone, and I call the guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside.  Always like that?  No.  Yeah.  I can't.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over my cell.  Some shitting.  And Larry's about a 48 waist, so he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some 
[01:06:30]  towels, and so then he comes over and he meets me, I tell him where I'm standing.  And then he finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the fucking...  I can't get in the elevator.  But you are not.  You lose.  You know?  So he goes in, he finds the closest bathroom in the lobby of the hotel, and then I get  in the escalator, and he kind of pretends like he dropped something so no one gets behind  me.  He tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me, throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes, just wipe off, leave my shoes, my shoes, my pants, everything 
[01:07:00]  right there, the towels, right there in the stall.  And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through the lobby  like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning, took the most perfect double-tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  True story.  True story.  It's like no one even doubted.  Who's the pitchers in this game?  And then right back to business.  I love it.  It sounds like he's getting hard telling his story, man. 
[01:07:30]  I love, though, that nobody even doubted the story.  True story.  Oh, God.  He's the best.  Of course it's a true story.  Who makes that up?  He's a real man.  I know.  It's a good shit story.  And right to the fucking who's pitching.  Happy birthday, George Brett.  Brilliant story.  George Brett is fucking, he, that man spins a shit yarn like no one else.  Beautiful.  Now, would that be an Opie and Anthony nugget that we could throw on to the end of the  Opie and Anthony podcast that has become official today? 
[01:08:00]  Absolutely.  That would be a nugget, as would, uh, um, what's his name?  Just living out his dream some 18 years ago.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, Mike Schmidt would be a nice little nugget.  Absolutely.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  All right.  With two very bad knees.  You know, the dream.  Yeah, who cares?  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  We heard this already.  Yeah, so what?  Yeah, we, we, we.  Well, I want to know what happened, though.  Yeah, he fucking, uh, came true and he cries.  He thanks God.  And then it's fucking bullshit.  I think God's dream came true. 
[01:08:30]  We heard you.  We heard you.  Here's another angle.  Calm down, man.  That would be, uh, an Opie and Anthony nugget, though.  That would be a nugget.  The podcast is doing very well.  The podcast is doing well.  Every Wednesday will be a brand new podcast.  Wednesday is Opie and Anthony podcast day.  Yes.  Every Wednesday is podcast day.  That's right.  You can listen to it right now at Facebook slash Opie and Anthony.  You can, if you got an iPhone, you get the little podcast app.  You can get it through iTunes that way.  It's uploading to iTunes as we speak. 
[01:09:00]  You can go to SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony to get it.  Yeah, it's very gettable.  It's all over the place.  Oh, look at it.  It's right up on our Facebook page.  Right up top.  You click that, uh, little thing right there up top and you go.  Boom, you're listening to a podcast.  Dude, there is nothing better than a shit your pants story.  I know.  Anybody can listen to it and I shit my pants.  You can't start like, dude, I shit my pants that long.  Every person wants to hear exactly what happened.  Yeah, no one's going to interrupt you.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:09:30]  You're getting that story out.  I always look forward to, you know, telling mine.  And I know I tell people the same story over and over again.  I don't care.  I do it for myself.  Shit stories.  The time when I was wearing boxer briefs down in Florida.  Uh, the girl I was with at the time meeting her brother's girlfriend for the first time  and we were leaving and we were on their stoop and I was wearing boxers back then with  shorts and I had some kind of sandals on and I, uh, went for a little sneak fart and  a tiny little nugget fell out, rolled down my, rolled down my leg and hit my big toe and 
[01:10:00]  rolled across the stoop in front of everybody.  How embarrassing.  And that was the plug, by the way, I was popping out the plug.  Cause what happened was I had massive food poisoning and when we were saying goodbye and  I had to go back in the house and, uh, I had to kind of just, I had to stay in a bedroom  and I had a fucking, uh, uh, explosive diarrhea probably every five minutes for two straight  hours.  So that was the little plug that was being released.  You were embarrassed. 
[01:10:30]  I was, I was embarrassed, but now I'm not now.  I think it's a wonderful story at the time.  I mean, yeah, but I was so sick cause I could feel it happening in my gut that I honestly  wasn't that embarrassed cause I was so over the top sick.  I didn't care that this little nugget, you know, roll down my leg and hit my big toe and  went rolling across the stoop in front of everybody.  It presented itself.  And I know I've told this story 20 times on the air and I'll tell it another 20 times. 
[01:11:00]  I don't give a fuck.  I do it for me.  Do you have a shit story?  I don't know if Ann has ever told a good shit story.  I, I, I gotta be honest with you.  Jimmy has told a few.  I've never shit myself.  But you don't have just something.  Maybe no one else even knew it happened.  Well, there's just this little kid.  Look, see, Kenny's got one.  He's going right to the mic.  You got a shit story, Kenny?  No, Anthony, you told the shit story.  You were driving home and you paid $20 to shit in a restaurant.  Oh God, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  When you, when you clogged the toilet.  Oh yeah.  That's a good one.  To the mob guy.  That's a great one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had an upset stomach driving home before the Midtown Tunnel.  I, I, I was, I was losing it.  I was losing it.  I, it's that, that cold sweat.  Right.  And your thighs start hurting.  It was terrible.  So I, I, I just wheeled in front of this restaurant and it was, it's early.  You know, we leave here at fucking 10 or so.  So it's still early in the morning.  Most of these people, places aren't even open.  So I pulled in front of a restaurant, just parked my car illegally right there in front 
[01:12:00]  of it and went inside and it was like dark and, and, and some shit.  It was like in fucking Goodfellas when those guys are working where, where she should have  gone in to get the dresses.  Over there, over there.  It was like dark and kind of shady.  And, um, I was like, can I use your bathroom?  And the guy's like, no, no.  And, uh, I said, no, I have to.  I'm, I'm, and I wound up having to, yeah, shell out money.  You just gave him 20 bucks?  Yeah.  And he said, all right.  I use the bathroom.  That's fair.  It's not really a shake yourself or story or anything. 
[01:12:30]  That's great.  I don't really have one of those.  I do have one where, uh, I think I was seven years old and I was very constipated.  I was must've, I must've swallowed bubble gum or something.  It gummed up the works.  Yeah.  Mucked up the works.  And I had a stomach ache and I was over my grandma's house with my mom and everything  like that.  And I, I couldn't go.  And, uh, and she was like, okay, I'll take you to Dr. Fuchs again.  Fucking Dr. Fuchs.  The old Dr. Fuchs.  So we went there and I didn't know what the fuck.  I'm just like, ah, she's going to fix me.  Give me some medicine. 
[01:13:00]  So she's like, okay, lay down over here on your stomach.  I was like, what?  What?  And she fucking pulls out a suppository and jams it up my ass.  Wow.  Oh, did I, did old pissy eyes come alive at that point?  Wow.  And then it started working.  We got back to grandma's house and it was, I swear, I shit a dirigible.  It was, it was, and it was in the toilet and I, I called in mommy to see it.  You have to.  It's like, look, here it is. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Uh, what's this about?  Oh, they're suing the Robin hood people.  New Hampshire city sues the Robin hood guy for paying meters.  Is that what this fucking, what governments are about in this country?  That this local citizen is just kind of paying people's meters?  It's illegal to go around and put money in parking meters.  Is that fucking sickening to how badly they want your money?  Doesn't that make you, that, that.  How is that illegal?  It makes it obvious that it has nothing to do with them wanting you to put money in for the park. 
[01:14:00]  Of course not.  It has everything to do with they want you to be buying an expired meter so they can write you a huge ticket.  Yeah, it's a revenue stream.  Right.  They don't give a fuck how much money those meters make and they're hoping to get the big, well, you said it.  Yeah, the big ticket.  The big ticket.  Of course.  Yeah.  So now they're suing the Robin hood guy.  How fucking.  A lot, a lot of cities and little towns have the Robin hood people.  Yeah.  I think there was one.  The video went viral a while ago.  He dressed up as a fairy. 
[01:14:30]  It would pay everyone's fucking ears.  I think we did that video on the show years ago.  The fucking guy.  He just annoyed everybody.  Oh, it's right here.  Can we see this again?  We haven't talked about this in years.  The Miami parking meter fairy.  Was this the one?  He would just dress like an asshole and then he would fucking take care of the meters for people.  Whatever.  I don't know if this is the one we did originally. 
[01:15:00]  But fucking.  Why dress like a fairy?  See, the city doesn't even want money from these guys.  They just want them to stop, I'm sure.  Yeah, because they want to be able to write those big fucking tickets.  Pieces of shit.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, so it has nothing to do.  They're just not like, well, we'd just like the meters to be paid.  If they just wanted the meters to be paid, they wouldn't care if this guy loaded them up.  The parking meter people drive me insane.  And I'm not talking about when they get me. 
[01:15:30]  I've just seen them walk around our neighborhood over and over again just fucking writing those tickets.  It drives me nuts.  Oh, Iraq comment.  Yes, Iraq.  You see the parking meter people a lot more now since they're putting in those bike racks that are not on the sidewalk.  They're in the street.  Yeah, because they take up parking.  Yeah, so the trucks can't make deliveries or whatever, so they've got to use the opposite side.  And they're constantly just waiting, especially down on 49th here.  They're just waiting for the trucks to make deliveries.  And they walk over with a ticket almost like it's ready to go. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Slap it right on there.  Well, it's so easy now.  They just scan the fucking registration.  And they're out of there quick.  And it spits out of there a little fucking tricorder they carry around.  And they pop it on the windshield.  There you go.  That's so they can write more tickets.  Yeah.  Because it was taking way too long.  It's amazing how quickly.  And it was always great to see the parking meter guy there.  And it takes a while to write that ticket out.  And it was always fun to see the confrontation with the person whose vehicle it is.  Yep.  But not so much these days.  They can be off a car within, what, less than 30 seconds? 
[01:16:30]  Seconds.  Not even 30 seconds.  It's amazing.  It's my biggest pet peeve living in New York City, how these guys write tickets for the  delivery guys.  Yeah.  Because, you know, we're paying for that shit in the end.  They hang around the front, too, because the food trucks come around.  Right.  And if anybody pulls over to go to the food truck, they're right there as well to slap  a ticket on you.  But why hasn't anyone tackled that with the mayor?  Because there's money.  Yeah, why would the mayor fucking...  But why isn't anyone yelling and screaming about that?  Because it, I mean, it's impossible for these guys to deliver their shit without getting 
[01:17:00]  tickets.  They know.  It's a fucking cost of doing business.  It's the cat and mouse game.  It's...  Everyone knows it's done.  You've got a tiny little car you can't find parking in New York City.  And now the city expects, like, the Coca-Cola truck to find legal parking for every stop  he has to make every day?  Yeah.  It drives me nuts, because you know what it really is about.  And it's just about making a shitload of money for the city.  It's revenue.  They know these guys can't park legally. 
[01:17:30]  It would be impossible.  Yeah.  It's all about that.  The red light cams, the fucking parking meters, the muni meters that are out there.  They haven't updated a lot of them, and...  They're broken.  A lot of them are busted.  And then you try to explain...  You don't have...  You can't talk to anyone.  No, there's no one to talk to.  It's like this place.  Well, it's like, who do I talk to about this?  Bah!  Yeah!  Bah!  Here's who you talk to.  You pay.  And how about this?  With the muni meters, you know, they're at the end of the block.  I've seen guys get tickets as they're going to get a parking ticket. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  You walk away from your car.  You have to.  You have to go...  Let's call it 30 feet down to get a ticket so you can park legally.  And the meter fucking maids, and there'll always be meter fucking maids, come along  and we'll write the ticket while you're online at the muni meter.  And then you come back and try to explain it.  They don't give a fuck because they wrote their ticket legally, technically.  Now you've got to fight it in court. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  So it's a big pain in the ass.  They never...  They're so hateable, the meter maids.  There's no thinking that goes along with it.  There's no, like, looking at the situation.  There's no...  They just write the fucking ticket.  There should be a human element to it where it's like, well, this guy's delivering something.  He's not taking up a lot of room.  He's not in the middle of the road.  Obviously, it's a quick delivery.  Right.  Like, there's none of that thought.  It's like, he here, I write. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  There should be some type of looking at the situation and seeing if it's a problem.  Because all it's supposed to be for is to have traffic move and keep things like hydrants open and bus stops and things like that.  Well, it would be bad enough if they gave every delivery truck one ticket per day.  Yeah.  The problem is, you know, I documented it and you can see it for yourself.  These guys get up to a dozen tickets a day.  Yeah.  A dozen.  Every stop, they get a ticket. 
[01:19:30]  I talked to one guy.  He goes, this is nothing.  We get a parking ticket every fucking stop, every fucking day.  Yeah.  It's part of their cost of business.  Do you ever look at parking on a road where there's no parking and stuff and there's absolutely no reason there's no parking?  Like, why is that?  Why is there a road where the curb is clear?  There's just absolutely no parking.  It's not a loading zone.  There's not driveways.  It's not a hydrant.  There's no reason, aside from it's convenient, people will park there and they'll be able to write them tickets. 
[01:20:00]  They've determined that some of these streets, you know, they need to keep completely clear so it's traffic for the tunnels and stuff.  Well, I can understand some of those.  Yeah.  But then they expand that.  There's no reason to have these roads.  Right, right.  You just look and say, why is that whole side of the street no parking?  Their whole game is, you know, less parking spots than they could give out more tickets for people parking illegally.  The street cleaning regulations.  Well, the fire hydrant thing is stupid.  A fire truck only needs what? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  They don't need any room, really, to fucking hook up their hoses.  Nah.  Technically.  They'll go through a car if they have to or over the top of a car.  Yeah.  But sure, all right, give them a little room so they can, you know, hook up their hoses.  But now it's what?  20 feet on each side.  It's 20 feet on each side.  And that's just so they could eliminate another two parking spots per fire hydrant.  It's not like he rocks a fire, man, you know.  And every block has a...  20 feet wide.  And every block has a, I don't know, like, I would say six fire hydrants.  Yeah.  So every block they eliminated another 12, you know, parking spots. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  And that's just so they could write more tickets.  Make it harder to park.  It's such a fucking scam.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, this guy had a great story and he's gone.  It probably wasn't a great story, right?  Oh, jeez.  There's a story in Boston.  People are putting tickets on their own cars.  Oh, right.  What do you mean?  So they don't give you another ticket.  So you have a ticket.  You just put it in your windshield.  But they'll fucking just keep throwing tickets under your fucking windshield wiper. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  That doesn't mean that they're going to pass your car.  No.  They'll just give you another one.  Yep.  I've seen multiple tickets on regular cars all the time.  And certainly on the delivery trucks.  E-Rock.  I've seen guys from the parking garage.  They save the little white stubs that they put on your windshield there.  Yeah.  Because they turn it upside down and put it inside their car on the windshield there.  Because you have that little black strip at the bottom of your windshield.  So they can park in the muni areas.  So when they look around, all they're looking is for that little white car.  Oh, it looks like.  So they look and then just keep going. 
[01:22:00]  I bet that doesn't work a lot.  I got one recently with a fucking expired muni meter thing.  Sometimes I'll sneak in the old ones.  I just keep one and I'll get hoping.  It's in the rain that works.  Because I'm not going to walk out in the rain and examine.  But I got caught recently.  Oh, you didn't get caught?  Yeah.  It's all right.  I've gotten away with it.  No, they're on to all that.  Because, you know, they've got to get their quote in, I guess.  They certainly do.  What does this have to do with OJ, though?  That's all I want to know.  Is OJ speaking today?  I think OJ.  I'm not sure if it's today. 
[01:22:30]  But OJ will be taking the stand the first time we've ever seen him with all those court  hijinks actually speaking, you know?  He won.  That will be televised, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Good.  He won the right to have one hand uncuffed during this hearing.  So he's got one hand cuffed to the table or something.  And the other one's free so he could drink water and take his notes.  Remember OJ with the yellow legal pad? 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Oh, that's a good point.  And he'd write something down.  Oh, Johnny Cochran said.  I would love to read that stuff.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Just drawings.  Like primitive drawings of a knife.  Yeah.  Going into stick figures.  With a smiling face.  Before we get too deep into OJ, this guy's got a very good question.  Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian, go ahead.  Brian.  Hey, I wanted to know, what do you guys think?  Is our tickets just inherently not the solution?  Or do you think it's, you know, the way they're enforcing it? 
[01:23:30]  Well, it's the way they're enforcing it.  They're complete scumbags.  They don't give anyone a break.  And they're writing multiple tickets all day long.  I'm more obsessed with the delivery trucks and how those guys get multiple tickets every  single fucking day because we're paying for that in the end.  Because then the companies, we've learned over the years, they go down the courts and  they make a deal.  So they're not paying for, you know, the full amount.  But still, it's hurting us.  Did you guys hear about the... 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, it's all news.  Did you guys hear about the solution they have in Japan for this problem?  In Japan?  They shat on each other?  They use like a knife.  Sell underwear in the fucking vending machines.  Those weirdos.  You know what?  What are those weirdos doing about it?  Because I can't talk.  Huh?  Sorry about that.  I shouldn't say anything because I can't talk, Jim.  Exactly.  But I think what they should do is put a sticker on there that says, hey, give me a break,  buddy. 
[01:24:30]  What do you mean?  Car crash.  I don't know.  Fuck it.  As you said that, your phone should have blown up in your ear the way the Israelis killed  that terrorist.  Did Japan come up with a solution, though?  Yeah.  Well, what they did was, not really.  Oh, that big looks good.  There was this black market thing.  God damn it.  Fuck.  What?  Sorry.  Oh, no.  That's okay, buddy.  Let me slow down.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  Slow down.  Slow down.  It's your show.  But they've been selling these military license plates on the black market.  So guys with their small little cars will put this military license plate and say, yeah,  my Mazda Miata is a military vehicle.  What?  And they could just park it wherever they want.  Yeah, we've heard stories.  NYPD guys get fucking parking tickets.  Yeah.  Those window placards don't work anymore. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  Nothing.  Really?  Yeah.  And the meter maids are under the NYPD's watch.  And they still give the fucking guys tickets.  Yep.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Thank you.  All right, man.  I don't know what the solution is because now the cities have counted on that money for  their own budgets.  So they're not going to listen to anything.  Yeah, it's figured into their budget.  Right.  That's the problem.  How do you do that?  It's never going to get better.  They don't want to take that out of their budget.  No.  That's a lot of cash. 
[01:26:00]  Anyway, OJ, will he talk today?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if it's today.  We should check that.  Is this on the fast track?  Yeah, because it's not like a trial.  It's a hearing.  Hearings are usually fast.  Yeah, they just go in there and say, you know, I think I should have the right to back  in the box, OJ.  But, you know, when this first hit, everyone said he doesn't have a chance at a new trial.  But I don't know, the more they're digging into this, I think he might just get it. 
[01:26:30]  He's paying for the murder of two people.  That's what this is all about.  This has nothing to do with fucking his memorabilia.  Right.  He's paying for the murder of two people that he got away with.  Right.  If he was just OJ, the sports guy, he would have beat this charge in the first place.  So you don't think he gets a new trial?  No.  No.  Back in jail.  For another three or four years.  And then maybe he's still alive.  Maybe he's out.  Maybe then he's like, okay, I did it. 
[01:27:00]  It's my myoculpa.  We fucked up one thing yesterday when we were talking about OJ.  Remember we were talking about his book, If I Did It?  Yeah.  Fred Goldman put that book out.  He owned it.  He owned the rights to that.  Right.  So the Fred Goldman family, Fred himself, made sure the if was very, very tiny.  Oh, what?  Really?  Yeah, I forgot to say it.  Yeah, I forgot to.  Fred Goldman, that was Fred Goldman's way of saying, fuck you. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  Because he had something to do with that book, owned it or whatever.  But if I did, it was OJ going to, that was what he was going to call it, though.  Right.  But then Fred said, well, now we own it because we own OJ's shit, so we're going to make the  if part very, very tiny.  Ah, good for him.  Yeah, that was Fred Goldman's latest fuck you.  Man, OJ.  OJ must hate Fred Goldman.  Well.  Well, yeah.  I know.  I think Fred's hate's a little stronger.  True.  In the end. 
[01:28:00]  True that.  Yeah, where's the OJ writings?  I want to read some of that.  Hello.  This guy left college because of too many parking tickets?  That's a little crazy.  Oh, God.  What, did you just sit there and get, what, did you just sit there with a fucking drive-thru  speaker and listen to class?  Spencer, what are you talking about?  Spencer!  That sounds crazy.  No, I went back to college, I mean, it's been almost 20 years now, but I didn't, I took  out loans, I didn't have my parents helping me, and you had to get a parking detail, or decal 
[01:28:30]  to park on campus, and it was about $300 or $400.  And the parking tickets were about $45, and they would put them in little yellow envelopes  underneath my windshield wiper, and I thought I'd outsmart them and just leave the little  yellow envelope there overnight and not move my car.  By the end of the semester, I literally had over $1,000 because they were just shoving  parking tickets in there like twice a day. 
[01:29:00]  And I didn't know, even on college campuses, knowing, I lived on campus.  Yeah, knowing college kids don't have fucking money in general.  And they wouldn't let me sign up the next semester, and I literally never went back to  college.  Wow.  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That sucks.  All right.  And then someone in Boston is saying that multiple tickets on windshield, you could get hit for  the same offense in 24 hours in Boston.  You can't get hit.  Oh, you can't?  So that would be one of the solutions, to get one ticket per fucking day. 
[01:29:30]  Why don't you do that?  Huh?  They should do that.  We should have a segment on the show.  In New York?  We should have a segment called, That's Outrageous!  And, like, the guys call in and go, I got two parking tickets for the same day.  That's outrageous!  That's, that's, that's outrageous.  With a sounder that we play.  That's outrageous!  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fine videos are fucking easy.  Oh, I saw your latest fine video.  Chip. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, it's fucking viral.  You ripped me off.  No, I didn't.  We had the same thought.  Finally decided I would do the phone gun.  Yeah, I did that, too.  Did you do yours, too?  Yeah.  Oh, is that why everyone else is doing it?  That's why Chip did it, and that's why Joe did it, yeah.  Oh, that's why Joe did it, as well.  No, they took my thing.  I always saw Joe's, and then I saw Chip's, but I didn't see yours.  I did it first, and they were like, let me do it.  No, Chip.  I was like, I'm right ahead and join.  I did it, and then Chip joined in, and then my brother fucking did.  Where's yours, Ann?  I didn't see yours.  Mine's, uh, fine.  I did see Joe's, and I did see, uh, Chip's. 
[01:30:30]  Wait, wait.  Turn your guns this way.  That gun's great, dude.  Yo, homeboys, turn your cameras this way.  Turn your guns this way.  Yo, homeboys, turn your cameras this way.  I had to use the biggest, most obnoxious gun I had.  Yes, that is a fucking Dirty Harry fucking, is that a Desert Eagle?  It's a Desert Eagle.  Homeboys, take your guns and go like that one, and then take your phones and go like that  so we can see everything better. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, homeboys, take your guns and go like that one, and then take your phones and go like  that so we can see everything better.  Better.  Better.  He makes the face.  Are those up on the Facebook page?  Going up now.  Yeah, those should be seen by a lot of people.  Bobby, yeah, this one's good too, Chip.  Stop yelling at me, you cocksucker!  Go, go, go.  Stop yelling at me, you cocksucker!  Chip's going to be a hit on Vine. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  Chip is calling on Vine.  Made for Vine.  I have a couple of ideas that I'm going to do.  Six seconds at a...  Oh.  Chip-a.  I fucked up last time, but I figured out what I was doing wrong, so this time it should  be...  Hey, it's Chip-a.  I fucked up last time, but I figured out what I was doing wrong, so this time it should  be...  It just stops!  It is hard to fit things in six seconds, isn't it?  No, it ain't.  Are you wearing glasses?  Sunglasses. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, that was sunglasses.  I'm going to have some new shades.  Fucking cool.  My new shades.  Yeah, they're fucking cool.  They're wild colors.  Fucking pussy's going to be falling out of the trees.  Very funny.  Yeah, those should be up on the Facebook page, so...  All right.  Vine.  A lot of people getting on board with the Vine thing.  Yeah.  They don't have an Android app.  Once they get all the phones...  I'm sure they're working on it.  Believe me.  Yeah, but what...  How hard could that be?  I think you just don't know it. 
[01:32:30]  There's a totally different operating system, and I think that they probably don't know  it first if it's going to fly.  It just amazes me they can't figure that shit out fast.  It took me forever to get on Instagram because I have an Android phone.  Yeah.  It's a Samsung Galaxy S3.  And I can't make Vine videos.  Fine.  But, I mean, Vine's hot right now, so we'll...  It has a lot of people, isn't it?  You would think they would get that out there immediately, or try to.  It is that complicated, I guess.  It's weird to see, like, celebrities.  Oh, come on, dude.  I might... 
[01:33:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Love it.  I heard Mariah Carey was pretty good on Vine.  Is she?  I don't know.  I haven't seen that one.  Dick Van Dyke, though.  Like, playing the piano.  It was fucking weird.  It's like, he's in his house.  Right.  And he's like, hey, bing-de-dee.  And you get six seconds of seeing Dick Van Dyke playing a piano in his house.  That's five seconds more than I needed it.  Exactly.  But...  I gotta see that.  It's more just the, you know...  Oh, Dick Van Dyke.  Just the fact that he's there. 
[01:33:30]  You know, you grew up watching stupid Dick Van Dyke, and...  Yeah, how old is Dick Van Dyke?  It's a very good question.  Dick that Dyke.  Fucking call me up.  Let's see a Dick Van Dyke Vine video.  Anyone.  I don't care.  Mmm.  What was the one with the cake?  Oh.  That wasn't nice.  Oh, that wasn't nice.  You come by and step in it. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  I love it.  I earned that.  Will they leave it out in the rain?  I don't know.  Ah, that's another good one.  Yeah.  Did you earn that cake?  Really?  Oh.  It was stale.  I didn't earn that.  Hey, we getting Jimmy Connors.  He's now on The Morning Joe.  Exactly.  He's doing everything but this show.  We said yes to Jimmy Connors.  Yeah.  What happens after we say yes to some of these guests?  Don't say no to us.  He said he had my lawn chair outside the studio and just doing phoners.  How old is Jimmy Connors?  The bad boy of tennis.  He's only 30. 
[01:34:30]  Damn.  Look at him back in those days.  Remember the big head of hair he had?  Yeah.  The outsider.  I know how that is.  Oh, boy.  Being on outside looking in.  He was an obnoxious guy, wasn't he?  Yeah.  He was.  John McEnroe put it over the top.  Well, yeah.  I think Jimmy Connors had his moments, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, certainly.  Last time I saw John McEnroe, him and Patty were at the cellar.  And we said hello upstairs.  And then he went down.  And I bombed my fucking face off. 
[01:35:00]  In front of him?  Well, yeah.  He's come to see me before.  So I kind of know him.  We're not good friends.  But I know him casually.  And, oh, did I bomb.  Oof.  Whoa.  It was a holiday bomb around Thanksgiving.  One of those non-comedy club audiences that just came in for a little laughter.  And I didn't deliver it to them.  We did a show.  Remember the audience they shipped in from the projects? 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  You remember that, right?  Yeah.  And they're all sitting there.  The audience, half of them were falling asleep.  Or didn't give a fuck.  And we did a show.  And then I saw him in the neighborhood with Patty at Santa Fe.  I'll go real local on Columbus Avenue.  And I felt like, you know, we really got along.  Didn't we feel like we kind of all got along when we did John McEnroe's show?  Yes.  So then I was feeling it.  And I went up to his table and said, hey, what's up?  And he, oh, it's so obvious.  Couldn't be bothered. 
[01:36:00]  I went too far.  Oh.  Again.  No, but that's not too far.  That's not you going too far.  I was like, holy fuck.  I thought we got along.  I did, you know, I did your TV show with Anthony.  Just like Obama.  And I think he.  Just like your friendship with Obama.  I know.  And I think he did our radio.  Didn't he do our radio show too?  No, we never had him on.  Not even on the phone or something?  I think he might have been on the phone once.  Yeah, maybe.  And he was polite and nice, but it was so obvious, like, go back to your stupid fucking table.  Who gives a fuck he's in the same restaurant just because you did his TV show. 
[01:36:30]  There was nothing there.  Yeah.  And I started heating up because it was obvious, as I was saying, that there was nothing there.  Oh, God.  It's the worst feeling.  Oh, believe me.  You guys got to see that with me and Dennis Leary that day in Boston.  Yeah.  You think because you're in the entertainment business, you actually make these weird connections.  And you realize in the end, every once in a while, sure.  But, like, I made that connection with Bob Sag and we ended up becoming friends.  Right.  And we've gone out to dinner and stuff. 
[01:37:00]  But that's, like, that's rare.  It's very rare.  In the end, it's rare.  Yeah.  You get the shallow invites.  Oh, you know, next time you're out in L.A.  And then you awkwardly kind of try to get a number.  And then it's always, like, some extra step you got to take.  And, you know, that extra step basically means, I was just saying that on your show.  Yeah.  You know, it's a weird friendship that I didn't even know existed.  My pal Adam, Adam Ferrara.  Right.  And Richard Marks.  Like, there's a love fest going on, on Pal Talk.  It's like, hey, on Pal Talk, on fucking Twitter. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, pal.  Good to see Adam Ferrara on Nurse Jackie, because he's on Nurse Jackie now.  Right.  Thanks, Richard.  Thanks, pal.  When are you going to be in New York?  We'll talk.  We'll fucking hang out.  Richard Marks and Adam Ferrara?  Our friends.  I didn't know about this.  However, that sounds like a revolting Twitter conversation.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Hey, when are you going to be here, pal?  Believe me, I didn't like it all.  Text each other, shitheads.  I didn't like all the pally-wally either.  Wait till I see Adam. 
[01:38:00]  I'm going to fucking bite his little good-natured hand.  In the end, we're not friends with just about every single person that comes on our show.  Yeah.  Besides our, you know, comic friends.  Uh-huh.  Let me tell you, my friend.  I'm making a list right now.  Do you have actual friends?  Yeah.  That came from this show?  Well, Ozzy, you've been to Ozzy's house.  I'm not friends with Ozzy.  Sharon, I'm more friendly with.  Like, Ozzy knows me, but I'm more...  I'm not just saying that because I might be doing two Sabbath interviews coming up.  Oh!  Ah, you know!  And you love the new album, huh? 
[01:38:30]  Dude, you don't understand.  Didn't you tweet something like I cried?  I almost...  No, I didn't cry, but I wanted to cry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I loved it.  Wow, why?  So, a couple of reasons.  One, I've been looking forward to it for fucking 30 years or 25 years.  Secondly, it's...  Jesus Christ.  It's fucking great.  I loved it.  And, like, internally, I might even be...  Why did you love it?  Just because you're such an uber fan?  It was so Sabbath.  Really?  It didn't sound like rehashed Sabbath.  It didn't sound like, oh, this is, like, fucking Master Reality. 
[01:39:00]  But it sounded like it was recorded in 1972 and then stashed.  Because all their albums, none of their shit from Master Reality belongs on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  So I kind of like that about them.  Every album had a very distinct sound.  And this one does.  And it's old Sabbath, but it's not rehashed.  And I'm fucking out of my mind waiting for the...  All I've been listening to is God is Dead.  How does Ozzy sound on it?  Fucking fantastic.  I want to hear it.  I'm obsessed with God is Dead.  I've been listening to it. 
[01:39:30]  Is that the first song?  That's the one that...  Oh, they're on CSI tonight.  What?  They're on CSI tonight doing, like, two minutes of the opening song called End of the Beginning.  Really?  Which, uh, they are, I guess they performed it and they're playing it tonight.  Yeah.  So it's a fantastic song.  Well, we should play it.  Let's find the...  We know there's no, there's no version of it.  I've heard the album, but there's no version of it.  It's being premiered tonight on CSI.  Well, what's the one you like?  God is Dead.  And they're, like, eight-minute songs.  They went old school.  Oh, they did.  They said we're not editing them. 
[01:40:00]  Let the radio stations do it.  Well, can we play a little bit of it or no?  I'd play God is Dead until break.  Why wouldn't we?  Yeah, why wouldn't we?  Well, let's just make love.  But something else is going on.  And Roland's here.  What happened?  Oh, no, I just want to say, uh...  His morning schedule is booked up on TV.  Who's?  Jimmy Connors.  I wasn't questioning you, Roland.  I was.  I was like, what is Roland doing?  I never question you.  I know, I just want to say...  Hold on.  What?  It's on.  I don't know why the computer's on.  Oh, that was you?  Oh!  That was on you.  Oh, Sam just fucked you! 
[01:40:30]  Fuck you.  Piece of shit.  I have to push that for that.  Did you notice, though?  That was a fuck you, Opie.  I know, it's all right.  He goes, oh, I didn't know the computer was on.  In other words, it wouldn't have come on.  Turn off the fucking computer, asshole.  He's fucking you.  Preventative measures.  Get Jerry Connors.  No, it's Jimmy.  Did you really stay awake for Star Trek?  I did.  I stayed awake for the whole movie.  I gave you a fucking challenge, is what it was.  What'd you do to stay awake?  I ate popcorn and drank small soda, equals really bad heartburn for like four hours. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  So I just go...  And the caffeine, right?  And the soda.  Yeah, I can't sleep.  So I'm wide awake, Bernie.  Because it's true that you fall asleep in every movie.  That's why I thought my bet was guaranteed.  Oh, yeah, because I just drink water, and then I just kind of doze off.  But you knew that there was $100 up for grabs, so you said, fuck it, I'll give myself bad  heartburn to stay awake.  Exactamundo, yes.  Not because the movie was good.  Well, the movie was good, though.  Yeah, a lot of action.  Yeah, the fire.  A lot of...  It was loud.  Lava.  Lava.  Starship Enterprise.  Yeah.  Fucking phasers. 
[01:41:30]  It's photon torpedoes.  Frozen people.  Frozen people.  Well, here's the other $50.  I only had $50 yesterday, so we're square, right?  Yeah.  Are we square?  Are we square?  I lose $100 at Roland, because he stayed awake.  Fuck.  I'm not doing...  You should have seen the other guy.  I'm not doing double or nothing, because now I know his ways.  Yeah.  He will give himself bad heartburn to win $100.  Yeah, because I just said, like, oof.  And then when it was over, I'm like, yay.  Bye-bye, my lanta, and discounted it. 
[01:42:00]  My lanta, and then you fucking got $100.  And the good shit.  I was happy.  What's that frozen banana shit all about?  It's for the...  Is that for Arrested Development?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little frozen banana shop.  You ever have a frozen banana?  It's delicious.  Yeah, I have.  I had one at the Bronx Zoo.  Chocolate covered.  It looked horrible.  It looked really bad to eat, but...  It does look bad to eat.  Because it's not like a regular banana, where you can just break it...  No.  ...and not look like a... 
[01:42:30]  Well, you're not supposed to try to warm it up by twisting...  Putting your hand in a twisting motion up and down on the fucking banana, as you put  your mouth over the top.  Some people suck it, because it's too hard.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, with a banana, right, roll?  Right, roll.  But a chocolate-covered frozen banana could be my new favorite thing.  And it's filling.  Peanuts are delicious.  It's fucking filling.  And they have other fucking flavors, too.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Can you buy that shit in the store yet?  I think you can.  The free ones are at Yankee Stadium today.  Yeah.  Free?  Yeah.  For the promotion for Arrested Development.  How do they do that?  We get Jeffrey Tambor, too.  Yeah.  I'm so happy to be talking to you.  When's that happening?  In a couple weeks, right?  That's exciting.  Next week.  The great Jeffrey Tambor.  I've seen him twice.  Whoa.  Perform.  You know.  That's with the accent.  I just wanted to do an Israeli accent.  Israeli accent.  It's pretty good, though. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  Irish.  Yeah.  Scottish.  Scottish.  Whatever.  You're a bag of shit.  Same thing.  Sam Roberts, what do you got?  Search Opie and Anthony on iTunes.  Hey!  We're up on iTunes.  We'll get the newest podcast.  Very cool.  By the way.  We finally made it.  Every Wednesday will be a new episode of the Opie and Anthony podcast featuring some of  the new stuff and some of the old stuff from our archives here at Sirius XM Satellite  Radio.  And a nugget.  And the Opie and Anthony nugget, which could very well be the George Brett story next  week.  I am making a list of our friends who we can ask to help us promote this. 
[01:44:00]  Some on their podcast and Twitter and some only on our Twitter because they don't have  podcasts.  Anything for my godfather.  That's exactly what it is.  This show has been promoting people for years.  So let's get the word out and then why don't you just put a little check mark for all the  right next to the people that did the right thing.  And we'll be keeping track.  We're going to have Travis.  I think we should have a link ready to send them so it's easy for them so they don't have  to do any work.  Right.  And ask them to help us. 
[01:44:30]  And I'm sure most of them will, if not all of them.  Very cool.  I think it's time to play Jim Norton's Choice today.  Yes.  I like when people pick songs in the break.  God is dead.  And then we'll fucking...  God is dead from the new Black Sabbath album.  The first one in how many years?  35.  It's called 13.  Comes out June 11th.  It's literally all I have been thinking about.  I'm obsessed with this new record.  Ooh.  Are you going to lose a big portion of our audience or are they going to love it?  I don't know.  Because it's a long song, right?  Oh, hang in there. 
[01:45:00]  Shut up.  Let them tune out.  What are you going to do?  Go ahead.  Tune out and watch CSI tonight and hear End of the Beginning.  What are you going to say?  Are we going to go to break or are we just going to sit here and suck each other's dicks?  I don't know what else.  Let's do both.  You already entered the song.  I don't know what else we're supposed to do.  Let me really ramp the song up.  Yeah, do the ramp.  Opie, do you have the mic on?  Yeah, now you've got to turn on the computer.  All right, don't embarrass Opie.  Just say it quietly.  Oh, okay.  You know, you've got to...  Eric's got it.  Let Eric play it from the system.  Okay.  All right?  Let me fucking ramp it up, you cock! 
[01:45:30]  It's got like a minute and a half ramp on it.  Yeah, I don't talk over the fucking music.  It's a lot of fucking...  It's an eight-minute slow old-school Sabbath song.  Shut up!  Oh, so you're not going to talk over the music?  No, I won't!  Oh, I thought you would.  No, I don't do that!  It's not professional.  Exactly!  Hey, we've all been looking forward to the new Black Sabbath record.  I know I have, have you?  Well, here's a taste of it.  Not the whole record, of course, because we're not privy to it.  Need a hot clock.  No, you fucked up! 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, you can't talk over the music.  You fucked up!  Very serious.  We've all been looking forward to the Black Sabbath record.  I know I certainly have the last one released.  It was a little album called Never Say Die.  This is not that one.  This is called 13.  I guess there's some significance there.  This is called God is Dead.  But there's a question mark after the song.  Well, it's our host, Dave. 
[01:46:30]  Imposions, Tim.  This is called Nigel Lord.  This is when it suggests a lot.  This is覺得 of our land.  I guess you've been putting together into the 2015 game.  This is a call.  This is very difficult.  Fair enough.  This is very difficult.  I think there's enough of the long run.  This is a long run.  I guess there's an interview anymore.  I don't know where you areTAG.  Eventually I think there's another game.  I think there's decent enough of the podcast.  But whatever you are next is,  We'll be right back. 
[01:47:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:47:30]  Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and saviour, help me make it through the night. 
[01:48:00]  Blood and my conscience and murdering mind.  Out of the gloom, I rise up from my tomb into impending doom. 
[01:48:30]  Now my body is my shrine.  The blood runs free, the rain turns red.  Give me the wine, you keep the bread. 
[01:49:00]  The voices echo in my head.  Is God alive or is God dead?  Is God dead?  Rivers of evil run through dying land. 
[01:49:30]  Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal and borrow.  There is no tomorrow.  For the sinners will be damned.  Ashes to ashes. 
[01:50:00]  You cannot exhume us all.  Who do you trust when corruption and lust, freedom of all the unjust, leaves you empty and unphold?  When will this nightmare be over? 
[01:50:30]  Tell me, when can I empty my head?  Will someone tell me the answer?  Will someone tell me the answer?  Is God really dead?  Is God really dead?  Is God really dead? 
[01:51:00]  To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath.  I transfer from reality into a living death.  I empathize with enemies until the time is right. 
[01:51:30]  With God and Satan at my side.  From darkness will come light.  I watch the rain as it turns red.  Give me more wine.  I don't need bread. 
[01:52:00]  These rain rules just live in my head.  I don't believe that God is dead.  God is dead.  God is dead.  God is dead.  You are dead inmail.  Nobody will live here.  Jesus is dead.  Any fui food or weekends when everything comes into a political process?  I catch my salt today.  Maybe you can吉利. 
[01:52:30]  Slow water into  Nowhere to run 
[01:53:00]  Nowhere to hide  Wondering if we will meet again on the other side  Do you believe in what  What the good book said  Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead 
[01:53:30]  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  Right 
[01:54:00]  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  But still the voices in my head 
[01:54:30]  Are telling me that God is dead  The blood pours down the rain turns red  I don't believe that God is dead 
[01:55:00]  God is dead  God is dead  God is dead  The Opie and Anthony show continues  Calling in to your favorite radio show 
[01:55:30]  Can be one of the funniest experiences there is  Boys, how are you?

[01:56:00]  These dream calls  It's become the stuff of nightmares  Hey Joe, you're a long time ago  Hey Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, I'm trying to get that young pussy now that you're a long time ago  Of course  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level  And I wanted to plug too  Yes  I'm at the Talking Stick Resort  Which is going to be a plan  Only the good places for you, Joe  Joe Piscopo  And that includes Jersey 
[01:56:30]  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic  Because after the standing situation, we all joined together  It's bad you didn't have a beach house  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box  So before you pick up that phone  Remember  The next asshole could be you

Because you guys  Put me right on the air  Instead of bumping me  For Paul Anker  Like you motherfuckers  Did laugh  We didn't know  What to do that day  Paul  I do apologize  Paul fucking Anker  Yeah, he wrote my way  You guys said it like  Like Scorsese and De Niro  In the studio  It's Paul Anker, though  Paul back later  Like  I was like 
[02:05:30]  Oh  We were  We were kind of scared  To meet Paul Anker  Because, you know  We've all heard the tapes  But he turned out  To be a really nice guy  I wasn't in that day  I know I missed him  Hey, if he was drinking coffee  He'd be Paul Fanker  Get it  That didn't sound like  Norton  It sounded like  Chip  Colin  Colin  This is how much  Of a fan I am  Of yours  I watched the entire  Wendy Williams episode  Because I knew  You were going to be on it  I guess I could have  Fast forwarded to your  Sure  Your segment  But then I'm thinking  You know what  I want to see what 
[02:06:00]  This Wendy Williams  Broad is all about  You wanted to see  Colin in context  Yes  Right  She's pretty funny, right  You know what  I can't beat her up  She puts on  A good fucking show  I am  It's not my  Cup of tea  As they say  But she knows  What the fuck  She's doing  Yeah  She says whatever  She wants  But yeah  She's pretty edgy  But that  I mean  And you did great  On the show  But that was a  Tough fucking crowd  Huh  It's like  What's her name  Hey  You do whatever  You want 
[02:06:30]  Yeah  What do you mean  It was a tough crowd  Are you trying to say  I bombed  You didn't bomb  I thought you should have  Got more from the crowd  Is what I'm saying  You absolutely did not  Bomb  Do not twist my words  Oh  Jesus Christ  What a morning  You absolutely did not  Bomb  And you looked great  I thought I would  Let them have it  In both barrels  I'm sure I'm looking forward  To seeing your show 
[02:07:00]  Yeah we're going  Tomorrow night right  You are  I love it  Yeah  How about  Is that little stupid  Blueberry coming with you  No  I will  First of all  The way I eat blueberries  Is perfectly acceptable  There's nothing wrong with  Aardvark when he eats blueberries  I do not look like  An aardvark when I eat blueberries  I look like a sweet boy  Behaving in a healthy fashion  And no  I'm going to be in Florida  I want to see the show next week  I'm going to Jacksonville tomorrow  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You know  It's a real stepper 
[02:07:30]  Early reviews  Good call  Yeah I heard it's great  Thanks  Voss  Did Voss see it last night  What's that  Did Voss see it  Yeah Voss were there  Oh no  He said it was really good  I don't understand it  But  Yeah  Voss  Voss reminds me of  Maury's son  In Goodfellas  Maury  Maury's son  Maury had a son  Oh  Oh god  No more bullshit  Right  Wish he'd go out the same way  Yes  Exactly  Going to get a Danish for Bonnie  Fucking stupid asshole 
[02:08:00]  Jesus  I'm going to go get a potato pancake for Bonnie  So  I got nothing  Except I was going to call and say  One person didn't RSVP  Keith Robinson  Did that surprise you?  No  I didn't even get an invite  I don't think they understand  Well we said it was an aging email  But  I don't think they understand the protocol that we set up  I understand they don't like a lot of our rituals  And protocols  You know a lot of them 
[02:08:30]  Caused them problems over the years  And even today  They'll cross the street at one mile an hour  To prove they don't believe in the system  Oh there's nothing better than watching that red hand blink in the crosswalk thing  And you just know he's going to be right in front of your fucking car  When your light turns green  Don't rush  Don't rush  Oh boy  They treat that red hand like it's  Like it's an itinerant case worker  Oh yeah 
[02:09:00]  They'll show us  By not moving in the crosswalk fast enough  Well anyway  Keith Robinson is doing a mild version of that in my opinion  Yeah  The fuck  They don't like RSVP  They don't like their whole language  No  I think they also confuse it with SPQR for some reason  I don't think over the years  I don't think they like any type of  You know  Initials  Yeah the only thing they really like is sticking it to white women  That's what my mother said  She said chip it  They ram it deep 
[02:09:30]  Wow  Jesus  She actually  She went from  Kind of trying to keep it  Keep the delusion  A lot of them  Are you her friends?  They are her friends  She heard that from her lady friend  Oh okay  Now it's just blatant  Yeah  My mother's ankles get chafed  Jesus  Oh  Oh thanks guys  I don't know why I called  Really just  I'll tell you why you called stupid  Because you wanted to plug the fucking show 
[02:10:00]  Yeah  Let's plug the show  Yeah I don't know the deep  Why would I plug opening night for the show?  Because it's more than just opening night  Where do people get tickets to see it in general?  Yeah I don't know anything about it  Yeah you terrible plugger  It's not all over the news  It's not the fucking Boston bombing  What?  Oh okay sorry  I took it literally  It's the hottest show in town  Hotest show in town  What's the name of the show?  Air conditioning's broke  Conditioning  Okay and where is it at?  Is that a chipper?  No  That's fucking 
[02:10:30]  It was Chip Kumi  It's Ted Barrows Street Theater  In the village  Nice  I told you I'm going head to head against the comedy cell  I'm putting them out of business  Oh yeah  Now is it every night of the week?  Every damn night  Every damn night  And how do you get the tickets?  It's Sunday  How do you get the tickets?  Oh yeah  I think you're a smart text  Did you Twitter  Did you Twitter a link Colin?  Yeah I did a few weeks ago  Colin's terrible at this 
[02:11:00]  How about a new one?  You're horrible at promoting yourself  Exactly  No I'm not  Because nowadays with Google  If people are really interested  Let them get off their ass  That's it  Make them work for it Colin  That's a good point though  What the hell  I want them to really appreciate it  Yeah  Yeah I'll just tweet a link  I can't wait to see it  Yeah it's a Broadway play  Called The Book of Moron  I'm going to invite all the tastemakers  Roland  Everybody  I love the first one  And I can't wait to see this one Colin 
[02:11:30]  Yes  I remember when you came into XM years ago  And you kind of told us all  That you had all these files of things you wrote  Manifestos  Yeah manifestos  And I remember  I was talking to my wife about it  I'm like  And you were so frustrated  Because you're like  I just need someone to go through my stuff  And help me figure this out  And you know  Fast forward a bunch of years  You're figuring it out  I know but I still wish I had that magic assistant  Why don't you just get someone  Who can fucking go through all this stuff?  No because it would have to be somebody who's got no 
[02:12:00]  It would have to be like a female chip  Only smart you know  Yeah  Just like a mousy female chip  A mousy  Nothing better than a mousy girl  Hey they get things done though  Yeah  They do  And they don't fucking say anything  If you try to stick it in  They just take it  Maybe an ex-Starbucks  Maybe an ex-Starbucks  Oh  Carl do you need this here?  Should I put it in the foil and put it away?  Should I throw this out 
[02:12:30]  Like my mother did me at the diner?  Know what I'll always love about you Colin  You always pick up on the really fucked up shit  On this radio show  Like you were the first one  That was all in with Scorch  You were the first one  That was all in with the retarded Laverne and Shirley  Well you took them  Those you guys were my idols  But you won the MTV Music Awards  Yes  One of the events that everybody took  Was this glamorous  Oh it's fantastic  As you date 
[02:13:00]  Right  That's the best thing everyone's ever done  Not only as our dates  We refused to talk  The company was so mad at us  They're like we gave you the prime spot  Yeah  Because they were trying to re-sign us  So they were kind of like  You know really really working on  Oh it was great  And all these big A-listers  Had to talk to those two dummies  I don't think we said a word that day  Not to the celebrities  I guess we were doing the broadcast  Behind them a little bit  Yeah  Carl this is really funny 
[02:13:30]  But you should tighten up the ending a little bit  I can see Patty giving Colin advice on his show  Really good advice too  Oh yeah  This is good  Are you going to have a blue or a green light on you  When you say it  Your point is really being lost here  I don't know what you're trying to say  What a frump  Yeah but you know what 
[02:14:00]  He's working  Oh wow  See what Jimmy did  See Colin  Yeah sometimes the aardvark gets off a good one  I wish somebody would smash a face  Into your blueberries right now  Oh it doesn't even have any  I don't have any  I'm cutting down on the strawberry  Hey Colin have you watched any Scorch lately?  Yeah a little bit actually  Because of Twitter  You know they send me some Scorch once in a while  Yeah  We're going to have to have like a viewing party soon  We're going to have to have you in  A few other people  And just kind of check out the latest Scorch episode 
[02:14:30]  Oh yeah  Yeah PFG baby  PFG  He knows  He knows  How do you not love a good Scorch PFG?  No I love it  Live  He keeps it alive  All right there Mr. Quinn  All thanks to his Iago  Sam  Yes yes  And you also love the fact that Sam  Just threw him under the bus right?  Oh that he tortured Sam for years  And he didn't realize  Right 
[02:15:00]  That Sam would make it way worse  Sam came back like fucking Maximus in Gladiator  Yeah  Yeah Sam  Like Billy Batson  Yes  Yeah Sam  Sam was like the fucking  The guy in fucking Schindler's List  That was shooting everybody  Right Carl?  Yeah well it's kind of weird  Oh god  Shooting up Syracuse  Chip ruins everything 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  Chip ruins it all  Oh we might be heading toward  Watching some PFG TV today  Who's that?  Who is that guy?  I can't see because Sam  Has the fucking screen  Aimed at himself  It's Mark Parenteau  That's Mark Parenteau?  Yeah  Wow  Does he address the fact  That he went to prison  For um  No  Trying to get sex  From a young boy?  Trying  You don't think Scorch  Would let him get away with that  Do you?  Scorch is a journalist  Above all else  No  I bet he just kept it  Fluffy and nice  I think Nick DiPaolo 
[02:16:00]  Is sorry about Mark Prentice  Yeah when I started  He was really nice  He told me to sit on a couch  And I realized  Alright guys  Alright  So we know Colin's show  Got another show  And we're hoping a lot of people  Go and check it out  Yes we do  Thank you Colin  Thanks guys  Hey follow me on Twitter  Hey Carl we got some good news too today

That's going to be some of the newer stuff we're doing  And we'll dip into the archives  Are you going to interview people?  No no no no no  No there's enough of those  There's plenty of those  It's pretty much the radio show  But it'll be  You know  Little pieces will be available on iTunes  And all the other places 
[02:17:00]  As a podcast  Yes  We're very excited  Indeed  Maybe this segment just made the podcast for next week  And everyone  I don't know  Well it'll certainly be hot enough to  That's for sure  Yeah  Call it surprise phone-in fun  Sounds good  No Lord  Michelle just defended Jimmy  Jimmy does not look like a hard walk  When he eats blueberries  They sent me more great blueberry tweets  After Norton  It was so funny  Right Jim?  How many were those great?  Yeah  Oh they fucking really  They couldn't stop talking about it 
[02:17:30]  I didn't  I didn't care for all of them  No  But I should be defended  My blueberry  Eating is completely  Perfectly acceptable  It's hack though  It's like  Oh blueberries are antioxidants  Shut up  People knew that like six years ago  Well I'm sorry  I'm not trying to be  I'm not trying to be a performance artist  When it comes to fighting cancer  I'll go with the old  Farts are funny  Cancer cures  Alright guys 
[02:18:00]  See you later  Alright buddy  See you tomorrow  I won't be there  Oh god  I should fucking go heckle him  No  I'll just yell shit out  You probably shouldn't  Yeah who are you  Ben Franklin or something  Yeah  Piece of shit  So you have a dilemma  Or you want to wait for the break  Or  What you want to take a break  I don't know  You can go either way 
[02:18:30]  What is your dilemma  It's not a big  Well  You know  There's an upcoming function  That I'd like to go to  And drink  No no no  It has nothing to do with drinking  I had a dream about you last night  Did you?  Was it good?  Was I drinking?  No  You weren't drinking  Wow  I don't dream about you often  This one was weird  You were eating  Cock  No  Exactly  I was in a wake dream  Giant  You were  My dream  You were eating giant bricks of cocaine 
[02:19:00]  Not even  Not even snorting  No  I was just eating  And it was a drinking thing  Because somehow  We were trying to figure out  If you were drinking or something  And you were like  No I'm not  But I'm doing this  And it was giant bricks  I don't know  That's something  I don't know what that means  Damn  So fucking weird  It made me laugh  When I woke up  So you gotta function  Everyone's speculating 
[02:19:30]  As to why I'm not drinking  It's just  They can't  Like get it through their head  Yeah  I just decided like  Eh  Let me see  First of all  See if I could do it  Because you know  For years you hear like  Well  You know  Oh I could just stop  Anytime I want  Or something like that  And then it's like  Well can you?  You know  Because I never fucking even tried  Well  And then I noticed  It's kind of fucking nice  To not fucking feel like shit  Anthony got tired  Of 12 year olds  Coming out of his bedroom 
[02:20:00]  Like Jack Waltz  Believe me  If drinking  Caused that  I'd still be putting it down  So what's the function?  What's the dilemma?  Well  There's a function  That I'd like to go to  But I'm not allowed  Conjunction junction?  I have to go to  No  My nice  Oh my god  I can't go to the prom  Oh my god  You're crazy  What? 
[02:20:30]  Why can't you?  Why aren't you allowed?  I'm too old  That's really ageist  Wait  It is ageist  There's an actual age  They put on it?  I'm not allowed to go to the prom  They actually put an age on that?  Yeah  And you'd want to go?  I would go  It'd be funny  I would be  I don't  I was going to say mortified  Yeah  Just because it would be such a weird  Fucking thing  No I know you don't care  Something like that  Wouldn't even bother me  I would care less  Does she want you to go?  Yeah  Would you have your gun with you?  Probably not  If it's on  Like a school event  Like that  I couldn't 
[02:21:00]  Wait  Would you go to  Would you go to the prom?  I did it when I was  I was five years older  Than my girlfriend  So I was about 23  And I was embarrassed  Right around now though  You are embarrassed  Depending on who it was  But I'm not allowed  What's the age limit?  I don't know  I think it's like fucking  20  It's probably 21  25 not  Probably right  That's like 21  You're officially not allowed  Officially  What about when these  Celebrities all of a sudden  Go to the  That's what I thought  I thought like  Maybe we could do something  Where it was a radio contest 
[02:21:30]  Yeah make believe it's a goof  Oh you're a giant  Just to get in the door  You're a giant fan  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Have her make a YouTube video  Right  Where she's like  All I want is Anthony Cumia  To go to the prom with me  And then I respond to it  And go  Oh right  Right  Wait she asked  And they said  No  Well no she knew the rules  She knew the rules  Going in  It's not allowed  And you're bummed  Well it would have been nice  I think if there's a photograph  Of you  That's so strange  I know you're in a real relationship  By the way 
[02:22:00]  That has nothing to do with that  It's just like  Trying to wrap my head around  Going to a prom  At my age  Holy fuck  That's so strange  If there's a photograph  Of you existing  With a Lyndon Johnson  Campaign button  They say they will not allow you  I like Ike  That's hilarious  So it's not a dilemma  If you can't go  No it's just kind of like  Oh you know  It's going to be a drag for her  Because she wants you to go  Who's she going to go with  Yeah you know 
[02:22:30]  Who's she going to go with  I don't know  I should probably just bring  Fucking  Bring a girlfriend  Hey we're here at the  Suck up  Yeah  It's like the fucking  There you go  It's like the fucking  You know  The big  The last big dance  I didn't dance  The big under the sea dance  Yeah yeah  Enchantment under the sea dance  Does she want you to go with her?  She did 
[02:23:00]  She would have  Yeah yeah yeah  You know  Not though  Wow and you would have  Go over to the parents  Go over to the parents house  And pin on the corsage  Wow  As the father throws himself  Out the window  Yeah  Yeah you're going to see  Both of the parents  Standing on the roof  Like the fucking maid  In the omen  Fucking hang themselves  Wow  Wow you got balls  Why?  I don't know  Is that balls? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah I can't wrap my head around it  No it's just fucking  What are you going to do?  Look I got  An age difference obviously  In my relationship  But I can't imagine going  Doesn't even come close  Yeah  I can't even imagine  Going to the prom  What are you going to do?  It's fucking  You know  I'm not  It's fault  And you're any  Shit  It's just you know  I can't imagine it  Because I couldn't imagine  Going to it when I was  In high school  I couldn't either  Of that  It would horrify me  At any age  I would just talk to the teachers  Yeah of course  Like hey how you doing?  Yeah  You guys didn't go to your proms?  No  I went to my one girlfriend Tina 
[02:24:00]  When I was like 22 or 23  And she was a junior  That was the biggest  Yeah  That would have been great  If you were having a conversation  With like the teachers  And they were like  Oh so  What are you  I'm actually here with  Her  Yeah yeah  Oh I'm here with her  What?  Or if she did the YouTube thing  What a creep  How do we get you  Into the prom?  There's gotta be like  A little work around  I don't think there is  She's gotta do the  Like you gotta seem like  You're a celebrity  Who's going  Because she's a fan  Right  And then you show up 
[02:24:30]  At the prom  And people are like  Oh that's so sweet  He's here you know  And then you guys  Just start passionately  Making out  With tongue at the table  Yeah  Yeah  Suck faith right Sam?  Yeah  I brought an 18 year old  To my 30th high school reunion  I love you for that  It was great  Were you happy to see her?  No  But Jimmy you wouldn't be able  To do that right?  Oh fuck yeah  You'd be able to do that  I wouldn't be able to do that  Yes  I couldn't go around  Bring a younger girl  Around my people  That was fantastic 
[02:25:00]  In a second right?  Fuck yes  That's funny  All the women  They were fucking  Just so disgusted  And annoyed  But that's exactly  How they felt about me  In school too  So  It didn't really change  You're just  You are  They see you  As the repulsive  Shock jock  Yes  Exactly  The guys were cool though  Of course they were  They didn't fucking care  Without a doubt  I would do that  But I wouldn't go to her thing  I couldn't  Oh I wouldn't  In a second  It would just be  Fucking great 
[02:25:30]  I wear my video  My video glasses  And get everybody's  Response  Reaction  Why don't you like  Try to be part of the band  Or something  Ah that would have been good  If I just go in  And sing a few songs  Yeah look up the band  And see if you can like  Do a guest spot  I could sing this one  Yeah  This is oldies to them  This was a great moment  Yeah don't  This is an oldies song  This might as well be  Ba ba ba ba ba bang a dang  This song could be  30 years old  Yeah  Oldies to me  What year did this come out  Spando Ballet  I'm gonna get to 85

Anyway, he heard a bit you guys were doing about Steve Perry from Journey.  And he was like, dude, you've got to call these guys.  Oh, my God.  Because a few years ago, Steve Perry called me.  Out of the blue, I got a call from Steve Perry of Journey.  Having grown up...  Fucking blue.  It was like, uh...  You know, he was my Spandau Ballet or whatever, so... 
[02:33:00]  Oh, my God.  He, uh...  Oh, boy.  Was wanting to find someone to help him record a new record, which I don't know whatever happened  with that, but, uh...  Oh, my God.  Incredibly nice guy.  I was living, like, next to a crack dealer at the time.  He was a dude with, like, pit bulls, chains, and stuff like that.  And Steve...  So, Steve Perry called to come over, and he ended up coming over to my house and, like,  sitting with my roommates and sitting on my little bed and, like, listening to tunes. 
[02:33:30]  It's one of the surreal...  Just totally surreal things.  But I also have, for your listeners, a message...  Wait, you saved the message from Steve Perry?  I...  Of course I saved that.  Oh, well, now he's getting to the meat of it.  Yeah, all right.  Let's...  Can we hear it?  Yeah.  Hang on a second.  Let me make sure I'll disconnect you here.  You still there?  I'm putting you on speakerphone.  Yes.  All right.  It's the future. 
[02:34:00]  Um...  All right.  You ready for this?  No.  We'll get to delay more.  Hang on.  Here we are.  More filler.  Shit.  Delay more.  Holy fuck.  He's been on hold for an hour for this.  Oh, okay.  Use my phone machine with the gobbling turkey hunt going on.  Um...  With the last, of course, of being killed and eaten.  Beautiful. 
[02:34:30]  Just...  I love America.  Anyway, um...  818-766...  Whoa.  No.  What are you doing?  Don't fucking put his number on the air.  See, Barry's gonna have to get a new phone.  After you called me, and I'm calling you, then, because he told you to call me.  And waiting I am for you, too, then, this thing will talk.  Bye.  That's my favorite.  What?  My favorite part, he says, uh, turkey time, gobble, gobble, I love America. 
[02:35:00]  That's what he said.  I don't know if you could hear that.  Oh.  Yeah.  We heard it.  That's everybody's favorite.  How could that not be your favorite part of it?  It's my favorite part.  What do you do...  What do you do that Steve Perry is calling you?  Yeah.  Briefly.  Are you having trouble sleeping?  It's bizarre.  I'm like an indie rock musician, and I've produced a couple records for people.  My name's Ethan Gold, uh, I also scored this weird airdrum comedy my brother made a couple 
[02:35:30]  years ago, uh, The Heart of Dungeons of Power, but somehow, I think maybe the movie was hoping  to get him to do a cameo.  We ended up having Neil Peart, uh, the Rush drummer.  Wait, I didn't hear, who did you say?  I didn't hear his name.  Neil Peart, the Rush, the drummer from Rush.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Wait, but your phone...  What?  Oh.  So anyway, we were...  Who's Mike, who's Mike Peart?  Yeah, we didn't hear the name. 
[02:36:00]  The name of the Rush drummer.  It's Neil, well, people say Neil Peart.  What?  No, it's Peart.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not Peart.  No, it's Peart.  It's Peart.  Wait, how do you say it, Ethan?  Peart.  No, for real, stop goofing around.  How do you say his name?  Peart.  Huh?  Peart.  Nobody says it like that.  No, no one does.  That's my favorite fucking thing to wash my hair with.  Peart.  Peart.  Peart plus.  Peart.  And he spelled Peart. 
[02:36:30]  I use head and shoulders.  Just say Peart.  Yes.  Exactly.  Oh, she has great Pearty tits.  I hold on, my coffee is Pearty lady.  I gotta put something in the Pearty meter.  Hey, I like Pearty and Ernie.  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  What are you talking about?  Peart's like ear.  The ear is...  Yeah, I know it's spelled like it would look like Peart.  We know what you're saying.  We understand.  The whole world says Peart.  The ridiculousness of it. 
[02:37:00]  P-E-A-R-T.  We're just Peart.  Yeah.  Neil Peart.  The guy was in morning.  You gotta...  About the afternoon.  Yeah, what about the evening, right, Ant?  Fuck.  Afternoon delight.  Yeah, afternoon delight.  This guy rockets in flight.  So, uh, so I did not work with Steve Peart.  I hope he's making...  Who's Steve?  Steve Peary?  You mean Peary?  Steve Peary.  Steve Peary.  Steve Peary.  Who are you?  Steve Peary. 
[02:37:30]  Neil Peart.  You know, you go through so many years of listening to Rush and hearing people talk about everybody.  I like Roosh.  I don't know who Rush is.  Roosh.  You hear it?  I've never, ever...  Every year I've been on this earth listening to Rush...  I've never heard anyone say Peart.  I've never heard anyone call him Neil Peart.  What's your favorite song?  Do you like Ria the Bard's Shadow or Liam Lit?  I'm a fan of Doom Sawyer. 
[02:38:00]  You know that one?  Yeah, let's hear a little of that.  That's a good song.  Call that shit up.  I mean, that's the one.  Alright, Ethan.  So you almost worked with Steve Peary.  That's pretty impressive.  It was...  It was...  It was an almost...  Almost...  It was...  The most amazing thing was just having him literally sitting on my, like, single bed.  He's like, yeah, man, let's listen to tunes.  I mean, he was...  You know what that means, right?  It wasn't about the tunes. 
[02:38:30]  His hair is the same.  Oh, imagine what a fucking, like, fanboy this guy was.  The only thing worse than hearing a bad story is hearing it reiterated.  What can I say?  I'm just teasing you.  I'm going back to bed after this call.  You gave us a wonderful entertainment today.  Thank you, Ethan, for the call.  Yes.  Ethan in L.A.  I know you.  You're all right.  You're a good dude.  Ethan, everyone. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Thanks.  Cool.  We're going to take a break here.  I can't fucking believe Steve Parry sat on the edge of his bed.  I know.  What'd he do?  Listen to tunes?  He sat there.  His hair looked the same.  Do you want to know what was going through my mind the whole time?  Pretend you're telling the story.  So Steve Parry...  Who gives a shit?  No.  The O.K.M.C. show continues.  It won't miss.  It won't miss.  It won't miss. 
[02:39:30]  The O.K.M.C. show continues.  Holy fuck.  We just got word.  Let's wait for it to happen.  It's happening.  We just got word.  Roger...  Wow.  Roger Daltrey's coming in here to say hi.  Who?  Holy fuck.  Grew up listening to The Who.  Are you kidding me?  Roger D. 
[02:40:00]  Huh?  Even I like the Who.  What?  This is really cool.  Look at Travis.  Travis never gets excited.  I'm so excited.  If we take a picture with him.  Holy fuck.  Let's just take pictures with him.  Who cares?  Can we spend our five minutes taking photos?  Yeah.  We just want to spend our five minutes.  Thumbs up.  Here's Roger Daltrey coming in the studio.  Oh, my God.  Here's a big fan of mine.  There he is.  Hi, Roger.  Mr. Daltrey.  Pull up a chair, my friend.  Very good.  We want to thank you for coming back.  We heard you were leaving the building, and we kind of chased your dad. 
[02:40:30]  He's a busy man.  You already left, right?  You're in the elevator, ready to go.  What are you up to?  Quick, fill us in.  I'm just here to promote a charity.  What do you got going on?  I'm promoting Teen Cancer America.  Okay.  The foundation that we've got started over here.  That is to help teenagers with cancer.  Oh, that's a great cause.  Sure.  And it's to do with changing your system so that they recognize that the ages from 13 to 25 are very different from children, and they're very different from adults. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Tell them me.  Yeah.  Do you think that they're not screened early enough?  Teenagers tend to suffer from very rare cancers, some of the rarest.  They also suffer problematically more late diagnosis because they're playing sports and things like that.  They also get aggressive cancer.  Cancer becomes more aggressive in them because they're growing so fast. 
[02:41:30]  So, all in all, they suffer quite – they've got a disproportionate problem rate with teenagers.  Right.  And the trouble with the system at the moment is that most of the hospitals with their adolescent and young adult programs, they go from the age of 13 to 40.  And, of course, a 13-year-old and a 40-year-old have got nothing in common whatsoever.  And what we've found in England, where we've been doing this for 23 years, we've built 25 hospital walls. 
[02:42:00]  We've got another 10 being built at the moment.  The evidence we've got, by isolating the group, you can refine the medicine that they get.  Right, right.  So, you get bigger success rates in the treatments.  Did somebody – did something inspire you to get involved with this?  Like, was there something in your life that was affected by it and you said, this is something we have to do more for?  Well, it was my doctor that started it and I just – it kind of made perfect sense to me because it's nothing to do with drugs, even though the end result will be to do with how they use the drugs. 
[02:42:30]  This is to do with providing care, providing specialist carers, psychological support, parental support, and environment because, you know, they think it's right that children should have teddy bears in hospitals.  You going into a hospital and find me something that's teenage friendly, you'll have to hunt to find it. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So, we just want to change that thinking and we want to make Teen Cancer America the gold standard so that – because every state is very, very different in the way they work.  By adopting that gold standard as a program, they can't hide if they're negating their duty of supplying specialist treatment for this specific age group.  Well, do you think that –  Does that make sense to you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  No, it does.  Absolutely does.  Screenings happen when you're a certain age, like you want to get checked for prostate cancer or whatever it is. 
[02:43:30]  You have to be a certain age for that to happen.  No, no, no.  The screening isn't a problem, but –  Jimmy.  Oh, no, I'm making sure.  Lots of issues where boys have gone in and they've got a pain in their knee and they say, oh, you've been playing football?  Yeah, of course I have.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, of course you have.  Well, I'll come back in three weeks and they come back in three weeks and they give them some anti-inflammatories or whatever.  And it hasn't gone away, of course, and they give them some more anti-inflammatories. 
[02:44:00]  They go back in six weeks and, of course, the guy's in agony.  Oh, man.  And it can turn out to be a bone cancer where they have to –  Oh, Roger, I was a little hypochondriac as a kid.  I always thought it was the worst thing ever.  Oh, my knee hurts.  It's got to be bone cancer.  That's what I always thought.  I was a terrible kid.  I was crying.  Like I say, this hopefully will change it.  And we've got one unit out in UCLA, which was the first unit.  There's a hospital in Seattle that came to our yearly conference three years ago in Britain, 
[02:44:30]  and they've copied what we do in Britain, and they're going to – I think they're going to adopt our standard.  Yale are doing an outpatients chop down in Philadelphia.  So it's taking off.  People are getting it, and the parents are getting it because there's nothing worse than being a teenager  where you're just coming into those times where, yeah, you can get laid.  Oh, man, right.  You know, you go do all the things teenagers do. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And you get wham with this one.  Who doesn't appreciate a good teen, right?  Right.  Well, I didn't mean it like that, Roger.  I just mean, you know, they bring a certain joy to the world, right?  No, it's just –  A certain youthful exuberance.  There's a time in your life where you can finally have fun.  Exactly.  And then they're stuck.  And to stick them in isolation.  Which is what's been happening, it can have, you know, serious kind of cycles.  Is there any way we can get involved?  Yeah, just look up teencanceramerica.org. 
[02:45:30]  And donate.  And donate.  And motivate the hospitals, the cancer hospitals in your states and area to look at what we're doing.  Come and talk to us.  How long have you been involved in the states?  I've been banging on doors for 10 years.  Two years.  And two years ago, I got lucky with the head of UCLA, David Feinberg, who completely understood it like I did.  When I was first told of what they were trying to do, just a bell went off in my head that this made such sense. 
[02:46:00]  Because most medicine is hugely, hugely expensive.  Relatively, this is really cheap.  This is just organization.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  But the benefits are huge.  So that's what went off in my head.  And I just got lucky.  I met David and told him what we were trying to do.  And he got it.  He immediately got it.  He sent the team over to Britain.  They looked at what we were doing.  Came back and said, we've got to have it. 
[02:46:30]  Was David a Who fan?  I don't know whether he's a Who fan.  Really?  I actually never asked him that.  I mean, obviously, you have your top priority of this charity, which is fantastic.  But he had to have been like, God damn, who's next?  I played that thing until, you know, I wore it out.  But Dave Grohl and Robert Plant and me, we did a benefit.  You know, Robert Plant.  Oh, that guy.  My mate.  My mate, Percy.  We did a benefit in someone's back garden in Hollywood. 
[02:47:00]  They raised $2 million, paid for the unit in UCLA.  Yeah.  And that's how we got the foot in it.  Did you sing with Robert Plant?  I didn't do any.  No, I'd love to do an album with Robert Plant.  I'm going to call him in a minute.  You should.  I'm going to get the phone out now.  Do you know what?  She reminded me.  You know what?  You two have great heads of hair.  Yeah.  You two have the best heads of hair I've ever seen in rock and roll.  The sugar in the sand.  Unbelievable.  So do you, it's got to be nice, though, in your position where you know that people 
[02:47:30]  listen when you talk, because when you use all the years of fame to get something  really good done, that's got to be a nice feeling.  I, of course, wouldn't know for either of those reasons, but I hear it's got to be nice.  You know, what else do you do when you're not singing?  You know, it gives me another motivation in my life.  I mean, for the last sort of 14 years, I've run a whole week of concerts at the Royal Albert  Hall in London, which has been supported by most of the British pop bands.  Right.  Like last year, we had Paul McCartney, for instance, who had done it several times.  More people have done it than not done it. 
[02:48:00]  Right.  We do a whole week, seven nights of charity a week, which is our biggest fundraiser.  And again, it gives you a purpose outside.  And the music business is great, but it's not 24-7.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's an awful lot of downtime.  What the hell else do you do?  Yeah.  Did you get to a point where you get so successful, where you're like, I just want to do something,  not else, but something good with all this, because you're on top of the world, and it's  like, okay, how do I give something to people? 
[02:48:30]  Well, no, I basically saw the link that without the support of teenagers when we were in the  60s, none of this would have happened.  The rock business wouldn't be there without teenagers supporting it.  Right, yeah.  So I thought, well, this is a perfect vehicle to get the music business to support, which  they did, and the comedy business in England, and it just took off.  And by the end of next year, we're hoping that every teenager that gets cancer in Britain 
[02:49:00]  has access to one of our facilities.  And what's the website and stuff that people can go to?  Is it teencanceramerica.org?  Okay.  I think it's the org.  We've got to get him out of here.  This was very nice of you to stop in and say hi.  Yeah, well, good to see you.  Enlightening people.  Sorry I haven't got more time.  No, that's okay.  No, it's all good, man.  But thank you for giving me a time.  We're obviously all huge fans.  It's not one of those things that many people want to talk about.  Right.  Sadly, you know.  Exactly.  But I've got to tell you one thing.  Of all the teens I've met, and some survive and a lot don't, sadly a lot don't, not one 
[02:49:30]  of them have ever, ever got me down.  They are truly magnificent, and the courage is amazing.  Now, watching and seeing the fear and the terror in the eyes of the parents, that destroys  me.  But the teenagers are fabulous.  So, I try and talk about it with enthusiasm, because I know they do, and they support it  with enthusiasm.  And they never get down, right, right, right, all the way, all the way down. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Excellent.  Very cool.  Roger Daltrey, everyone.  Be right back.  There you go.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Got to rush.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to the O.P.  Oh, God. 
[02:50:30]  He rock is such a cheese ball.  It's so cheesy.  It's such a fucking, it's such a Scott and Todd thing to do.  So, we had the CSI edit save, so.  Oh, nice.  That was fucking cool, man.  Everyone got excited.  It's rare that the whole staff gets excited.  Yeah.  Such a little guy. 
[02:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  Very short.  That's almost a beetle.  It's almost a beetle.  Yeah.  He's tiny.  He is.  Very, very slight man.  How tall is he, you think?  He's three feet tall.  It was amazing.  That's about what I would say, yeah.  Yeah, he's a little guy.  But, um...  If you check your phones, you should have your photos.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, yeah?  Look, that was a complete bore, but fuck, it's Roger Daltrey, all right?  Okay?  Yeah, it's Roger D. 
[02:51:30]  Couple of uncomfortable moments there.  You almost went for one, right?  I almost went for one.  I was going to say, when he performs for the kids, does he cut out the part that says,  hope I die before I get old.  But, um...  I thought better of it.  Yeah.  E-Rock, thumbs down.  I can't save it to my phone again.  Your phone stinks, because you're the only one that has that problem.  I used to be able to save the pictures to my phone.  Let me see.  Email. 
[02:52:00]  There it is.  I'll open it up.  I can't save it to my phone.  How could you not?  What if you just put your thumb on the picture?  Doesn't something come up that says, save to photo?  Library?  But then if he does it another way, it does do that.  Yeah, I have to put it in Photoshop and shrink it down so he can get it.  What?  Yeah.  Look.  What kind of shit is that?  Look, I can't do shit with it.  Dude, what kind of shit is that?  See, look, that's the save option, but it's not highlighted.  Well, not let me save it.  Why?  I don't know.  I mean, E-Rock, go back and forth with this shit.  It's always his phone.  Everyone else gets everything.  All right, well, what could I do differently? 
[02:52:30]  I don't know.  Maybe...  I'm not going to get another fucking...  There might be an update or something.  Good.  I'm up to 190K of 8.3 megs.  We've got to get the fucking router fixed in here.  Really.  Honestly.  Let's get a fucking router for here.  Can we, people?  Of course.  Can we get a router so we can fucking log on to a real network?  That'd be nice.  At some point, because I'm downloading at a whopping fucking...  Yeah, the company one takes forever.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Are you going to resend my picture so I can save it?  I can't right now.  I'll have to do it after the show.  Yeah, well, you can send it to anybody in my...  That'd be funny if your mic was on.  Sorry.  Thank you.  I thought it didn't sound very good.  He's a little guy.  He has tiny hands.  I wanted to just take his hands and go...  They should be sprinkling dust in a magical place.  Very nice guy.  I actually bent down from my picture with Roger and Aldrin.  I rarely do that.  Look at little Roger.  I'm not that tall, but he's adorable. 
[02:53:30]  He's so short, I felt like I needed to get on his left.  He's just a little guy.  I don't know.  What was he talking about?  I have no idea.  Teens with cancer.  Something about teenagers are getting teddy bears or something, and he has to change that?  And there's nothing for the teens.  So what?  We're trying to get Xboxes?  I don't understand.  Well, maybe something like that.  The treatment's not better.  It's the area they're getting the treatment in that has to be spruced up.  It's realizing, educating them on, you know, diagnoses, things like that. 
[02:54:00]  Talking about my generation.  It was cool for me as a big Who fan to fucking have that.  Oh, my God.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  I told you I did download the greatest Who hits a while ago.  I downloaded like three or four Who albums.  Did you?  And I did enjoy them, yeah.  What are some of your favorites?  I think Behind Blue Eyes is my favorite.  Not just because it's your thing.  No one talk to me.  That's very funny.  No one understands me, man. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, you got me in the Roger Daltrey picture.  That's very nice.  Well, I can't save mine yet.  Mine isn't downloading.  What?  Your fucking Roger Daltrey?  Zero bytes of 8.3 megs because the fucking connection, my Verizon connection, isn't doing shit.  What are you downloading?  The picture from Obie's Twitter?  That little cuddle bunny?  No, I'm downloading from my email.  E-Rock already sent us our Who pictures.  Oh, thanks, E-Rock.  Our Roger Daltrey pictures.  You're the good boy.  But I can't save mine.  You're the good fucking boy, E-Rock. 
[02:55:00]  So I guess I get to look at it for a couple minutes and then let it go away, I guess?  Is that what happens, E-Rock?  I'll show you guys how to do it quick.  You don't know what you're doing.  No, I'm not.  My stupid Android, I can't save pictures that E-Rock sends me.  I don't know why that happens.  And now it's just fucking spinning.  Is there a workaround on my end, E-Rock, that I could do besides get a new phone?  Yeah, right?  Maybe double tap doesn't work.  That don't work.  It sucks.  I guess I could just look at it. 
[02:55:30]  LTE really stinks.  Yeah, I can't get my LTE working.  Yeah.  This building really sucks for fucking reception.  Oh.  It's terrible.  I can't, I can't, I can't.  It's spinning and spinning, the little wheel.  What is your thing?  Spin, spin, spin.  What is your thing downloading at what speed?  Zero bytes.  Anthony, you want E-Rock to pick a song for your spinning wheel?  Round down. 
[02:56:00]  I like that E-Rock.  E-Rock does those little pick-ups.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  This is his favorite.  Here's where E-Rock wishes we had a visual element of the show.  Yeah, right, Anthony?  That fucking prick spinning around, right?  It's supposed to just be implied.  Jesus.  You don't like how he just jumps in and makes it his laugh, too?  Oh, I hate when Chip does that. 
[02:56:30]  Save image.  Yeah, why don't you save nothing?  Ooh, someone can fix my phone.  Dom in Texas.  Fix my phone.  Ooh, spank me.  Always the dommer.  Okay, what you do is, when you're looking at the picture, push your thumb on it until  a little rectangle comes up.  It'll say image, all kinds of fucking numbers.  There's a little itty-bitty box right after that.  Oh, what's their name?  That's why your saved as is an highlight. 
[02:57:00]  Click on that little box, your saved as or save button will pull a highlight.  Look, I'm pushing on the picture.  Look, does anything happen?  Yeah, we did the save button.  Gotcha.  Now lift your thumb up, right there.  I know.  I'm not that dumb.  I'm dumb.  I'm not that dumb.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Honestly, dude, I don't know why it's not working.  I gotta literally shut my phone off.  Oh, put it back on.  Everything's just spinning, and it's not fucking doing anything.  It's crazy town in here or something.  Yes, it's spinning. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, imagine that cock going around in a circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle.  I couldn't even stop the fucking mail, email from spinning.  You get to that.  What were you saying?  You couldn't stop the mail.  What happened to you when you were a boy?  Drilling my bungle.  In mouth.  Oh, what'd that do?  Look, I can't highlight the picture to get fucking some options to pop up there, Dom.  That's my problem.  I can look at the attachment as a tiny little picture, and then I can't do anything with it.  This miracle device sucks.  This is where you said earlier that the save button wasn't highlighted. 
[02:58:00]  Get to that point.  Right.  Good point, Dom.  Let me try to get to that point.  Oh, I see.  All right, I got to that point.  Now what do I do?  Okay.  Do you see where it says image, and it's got some numbers in the little box right after that?  Image way up here?  Where it's just got image and the save button.  It's like right there in the same little rectangle.  No, look.  See, is it in?  No, it just says save, save all, share, share all, but none of them are highlighted, so they're  not actual options.  They're grayed out, sir.  Yeah, they're grayed out. 
[02:58:30]  Okay, well, then I'm a fucking idiot.  All right.  You're not an idiot, sir.  That's why it's such a weird little fucking problem.  Look, Sam already has his picture up.  It's already on Facebook.  It's already on Facebook, and I'm still fucking around here.  Kevin, help me out.  Help me.  Download a different email app.  It's as simple as that.  Canine email will work fine.  I can save pictures all day long.  All day long.  Okay.  All day long.  Mine is just not downloading.  All right.  This is amazing.  E-Rock used to send it the proper way and then decide, fuck, Opie, I'm just sending 
[02:59:00]  it this way.  No, you decided to do something to your phone or upgrade it.  Oh, shit.  No one else has a proper picture.  I gotta take it, because, you know, he does send the pictures.  Yes, he does.  I'm a slave to E-Rock when it comes to celebrity photos.  He takes all the photos, and at the end of the year, he gives me a disc with all my photos.  He's a very good boy in that way.  E-Rock is a good boy.  So I can't fuck with him too much.  He's a dutiful boy.  We can work on getting a new router in here for you. 
[02:59:30]  I am ready to heave this fucking phone across the room.  Why?  Because of the spinning wheel around it?  Because everything just spins, and nothing is happening.  Yeah, play this with a prick at spinning.  I fucking, I, I, I, nothing is working.  Holy fuck, this is really frustrating.  Nothing's working.  Look, spin, spin.  Oh, now it's going. 
[03:00:00]  650, 700k of 8.3 meg.  Yeah, 8.3 minus, oh, 6.3.  Hey, that fucking cock is just.  There's one, there's one meg.  Do you think, do you think Roger Daltry's doing all that because he feels guilty about  some of his lyrics?  What are his lyrics to, you know, the other band?  Hope I, hope I die before I get old?  Yeah.  Talking about my de-de-de-generation? 
[03:00:30]  That kind of, at night when he has to go to sleep at, sleep at night, he realizes what  that actually means and decided, I gotta do some charity work.  Oh, blimey.  I don't know.  I had like almost two megs, it just started over again.  See?  It started over again.  This is fucked today.  Something's really fucked in here.  LTE stinks.  When are we going to get a router?  I got one little bar of LTE.  I want to get some money, I'll get a new router.  I heard AT&T LTE is better.  How much, how much is the router going to cost?  $2,418,798 with discount. 
[03:01:00]  Damn it.  How much is it going to cost, D-Rock?  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  It can't be more than like 60 bucks.  Now where did it go?  Sent from my iPhone.  So why don't we pay for the router right now?  So do it.  Ooh.  I'll go get it.  Yeah, go get it.  Get a fucking router.  Get a fucking router.  I gave Roland 50 today.  Just give him a hundred.  AT&T, bitch.  Yeah, and then go around the block and be like, ah, Verizon, bitch.  Look, I got my photo. 
[03:01:30]  Good for you.  Yeah, man.  Who cares?  Yeah, because you're in a fucking...  Wait a minute.  AT&T.  I got it just downloaded on my phone.  Oh, okay.  AT&T.  Yeah, I got that AT&T shit too, but...  1.7.  I got another problem.  You got bullshit phone.  I got an iPhone and AT&T.  I'm coming out guns blazing.  Apple 5?  I'll screenshot that shit and then fucking upload it that way, motherfucker.  I got other ways.  Right?  Yeah, there you go, Sam.  I was talking to Opie. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, God.  You don't like when Chip does that?  Oh, it could be the worst thing Chip's ever done.  It's like the most annoying thing Chip does.  Wow.  I'll just post the picture that Opie Twittered.  Yeah, but that's just an action shot.  I want, like...  I didn't even make wee-wee today.  I want to shoot...  All day.  All day long.  Get the fuck.  Take your piss later.  You really know how...  Do you know how to solve this?  Not from that phone.  You really don't, right?  Isn't that weird? 
[03:02:30]  Why wouldn't it be, like...  E-Rock sends it in the email, right?  Yeah, but then it gets to this point and I can't save it.  That's...  And it's still tiny.  Can you open it by scrolling your fingers?  Nope.  You can't make it bigger by scrolling your fingers?  Nope.  You can't do anything.  You can't do shit with it.  Two megs of 8.3.  You got a whack-ass Verizon iPhone.  Yeah.  Yours is Verizon, right?  No!  AT&T, bitch!  That's right.  AT&T has gotten way the fuck better.  I downloaded mine minutes ago. 
[03:03:00]  But you forgot about it.  You're not even excited about it anymore.  Josh, you were really excited.  That was really cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what else to say.  Sam goes...  Even Sam was excited.  Yeah.  Sam was excited.  I don't like a lot of old bands.  Why do you like Roger Daltrey and The Who?  I love The Who.  Me too, man.  They're great.  Why?  I don't know.  I've liked them for a long time.  Because other bands I don't like that we bring to the show.  I know.  I started liking The Who when I was in high school.  I don't know why.  Is that as close to Eddie Vedder as I'll get?  No, that's right. 
[03:03:30]  Like Baba O'Reilly.  Eddie Vedder loves doing The Who songs.  Yeah, I don't think we'll ever get Eddie Vedder.  That would be a huge fucking big deal.  I heard some things.  What?  About what?  Just about them and the company.  Problems?  No, good things.  Really good things.  Oh, oh.  What does that mean?  Nothing here.  I'll tell you off the air.  I can't tell you.  Oh, secrets.  Oh, I hate that.  Do you want to know a secret?  They're going to continue with the Pearl Jam channel?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And do other things?  They might do radio shows? 
[03:04:00]  Do we get Eddie Vedder?  No, I don't think he'll ever do interviews.  I mean, he just doesn't do interviews.  We don't need to do an interview.  It's also called just come in and hang out.  Yeah, have a few fucking laughs or something.  That's right.  Cup of coffee, maybe some pizza.  I've heard that he understands the value of this channel.  Oh, wow.  Thank God we've been made legitimate by fucking Eddie Vedder.  No, he's not talking about our channel.  You missed that part.  I meant all of satellite radio.  You missed that part because I started getting excited, too.  We're all big fans of your music. 
[03:04:30]  Not yours, but the whole genre.  Yeah, right?  I still listen to the Pearl Jam channel.  How do you not?  You know, they play the same 12 songs over there again in different forms.  Different live versions of the same 12 songs.  Did we do a bit in the past, E-Rock, the way we goof on Eddie Vedder and his music and  Sing Like Him?  No, I don't recall.  No, we did, E-Rock.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Who invited him?  You guys didn't download your photos yet?  No.  Chip is ruining the show. 
[03:05:00]  You're not wrong.  Chip.  Yeah.  E-Rock, what do you do, you asshole?  Yeah, what do you do?  You took a picture of a photo?  I took a photo from the screen of the camera.  Oh, perfect.  In the meantime.  No, I want it the other way!  You can see that it's you.  Holy shit.  That's a terrific alternative.  Yes.  That's good.  How did my photo come in?  Is it real?  No, I didn't.  Did you send it properly?  It's a forgery.  It looks like Roger Daltrey doesn't really feel like taking pictures. 
[03:05:30]  Well, he was in a big rush.  Yeah, he was tired.  He wanted to go eat.  It's a little jet lag.  Yeah, we got a big audience.  It told him.  Why is he smiling in Sam's picture and not so much in mine?  What did you say to him?  Were you taking one of his balls?  Sam looks like a cancer teen.  Oh.  Where'd you get that great wig?  Is that an LMFAO wig?  I'll take the teen part as a compliment.  Ah.  Yeah, you look like a really good sickly teen girl.  Looked like Big Ethel from the Archies.  He was at Woodstock. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, he was.  How old was Roger Daltrey?  Roger Daltrey.  Concert?  Yeah.  No, the fucking...  I knew he was talking about the concert, Chip.  I understood he was talking about the concert.  Do you think Chip is ruining this show?  Chip is so awful at just...  At just...  Oh, Chip.  I feel sorry for Chip, though.  Is that Roger Daltrey's real hair?  I couldn't tell.  Oh, yeah.  Roger D has had a great head of hair the entire career. 
[03:06:30]  Yep.  That big flowing mane of blonde locks, if you remember, in Woodstock and during the Tommy years.  Sure.  The shorter cut during the 80s.  And the now looks like my grandma hair.  Let's not forget the podcast started today, officially.  Yeah, it did.  We had a test episode up there, but now it's official.  And that test one is gone, by the way.  That was limited edition. 
[03:07:00]  Damn.  Limited edition.  So every Wednesday, a new podcast will go up.  Yeah.  And if you go to the Facebook page, Facebook slash Opie and Anthony, you can see, you don't  have to look at the posts.  There's a little link on top of the page now, next to the YouTube thing, that says the Opie  and Anthony podcast.  Perfect.  It's black and yellow and everything.  You can't miss it.  You can click on that.  It's black and white and red all over.  It's a newspaper.  Fucking good joke.  Not a good joke. 
[03:07:30]  Fucking good joke.  Like he's respecting us.  Or a nun with a spear through our head.  It's also up on iTunes, if you'd love me.  Well, and a few things.  First of all, it's free, because people are asking that.  Throw it free.  Yeah.  Second of all, it's going to be some new stuff, and also we're going to dip into the  archives.  And nuggets.  And then the Opie and Anthony nugget will end every Opie and Anthony podcast.  Yeah.  Those little things that we just kind of play.  The nugget.  Yeah.  It sounds like turds.  That's right.  I hate the nugget. 
[03:08:00]  What's this week's nugget?  I forgot already.  It's actually...  Do you remember what this week's nugget was at?  Do you?  Was it a bit?  Sometimes it's going to be a bit.  Sometimes it's going to be a production piece.  Sometimes, I don't know, it could be a song.  Or it could be like the George Brett story that we played earlier.  Right, right.  We played that.  That was funny.  We decided to honor the employee of the week, E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock, you're the employee of the week?  Yes, because that'll get your photo faster.  And...  Brett. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  And the after...  I got to sit this one out, guys.  Okay.  Do me proud, please.  We wanted...  Do me proud.  I got to sit out this one.  No problem.  We wanted to honor the employee of the week, E-Rock.  Yes.  And the after show guest of the week, Lil Jon.  Oh.  And...  How would you do that?  Well, we get this little nugget right here.  Oh, a nugget.  Thanks to the incomparable Sean F.  It's not really a nugget if you're going to play it all the time.  That's true.  There's no surprise element to it.  Shh. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  I'm trying to play a nugget.  You guys are talking about snacks.  Cheese and cream.  Quiet, Travis.  Eric brought to you guys.  It's part of the song.  Yes.  This one is s'mores.  Quiet.  This one is vanilla cupcake.  No.  Why?  I'm trying to lose weight.  When I'm walking with snacks, all eyes on me.  Cookies and cream yield big titties.  Want a flavored goldfish?  That shit's delish.  Eat all you see.  Get fat like me.  Come on now.  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks,

If you want, I can bring some cake tomorrow.  Cake?  Only if it's shotgun cake, can you eat it?  Oh, mean.  That's a good nugget  It just started over  Oh my god  I had three megabytes downloaded and it just started over 
[03:10:00]  Just look at my picture with it  I bet there's a problem with the network  The LTE  Like the Verizon cellular network  I bet there's an issue  You know what the problem is? Too many herbs using Verizon right now  Yeah, how about the good herbs, right Sammy?  Jesus Christ  Oh, now he's making like he's cool because he smokes weed  Yeah  He said the good herb  And then he put his two fingers to his lip and went  Made smoking a joint movement  Fuck yeah, Chiba  So not cool  Do you smoke drugs, Chip? 
[03:10:30]  Fuck yeah  You're afraid of drugs, you idiot  Well, Jim Norton's advice show is next  And he's also going to Jacksonville  Yes, I'll be in Florida tomorrow  Friday, Saturday at the Funny Boons  And the following weekend  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  I'll be at the  Stress Factory  Oh  In New Brunswick  By the way, this Saturday, the big night  Rotgut

[03:13:00]  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show  Fuck you, I'm fine  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian  An average author  And a terrible actor  And your chance to speak directly with him  Call 866-969-1969  And the Jim Norton show 
[03:13:30]  Starts now  Yes  Huh  I try not to talk too much over the theme music for a couple seconds  Let everybody get a little bit of dancing in  Nothing better than that  Do I have any reads today, Yurok?  No, you're good  Oh, no reads  Now, as a person I take that as  Hey, this is terrific  I don't have to do any reads  But as a performer I realize  That just means no one is interested in putting any money into the Jim Norton show  You're too controversial  I am, man  I'm too much kind to stir up  Too much shit 
[03:14:00]  866-969-1969  If you want to call and talk to Jim  That was Eric's social security number  If you want to steal his identity  Okay, thank you for the theme music, Sal  Even I'm getting sick of it  I was very cool on Opie and Anthony this morning  To have Roger Daltrey stop in  That was, as you know  I've not been the giantest Who fan of my life  But that was pretty cool  And I'm glad Yurok had the camera  Because I don't take a good photo  So I have to leave at 10 of today  Because we have to do breaks anyway 
[03:14:30]  But I'm taking my third straight day of working out with a trainer  I'm doing my trainer at least three or four days a week now  You work in your glutes?  Yeah, my glutes  Glutes don't really need that much work  And let's just jump right to Josh in Baltimore  What's going on, Josh?  Got a friend who's a major co-kid  Yeah, I got a friend who  A good friend of mine  And he's been very much a functioning addict  You know, he does coke  I would say 
[03:15:00]  I don't really know the details behind it  But it's gotten pretty bad recently  Lost his job because of it  And, you know, been in a couple months break between jobs  And a couple days ago  He decided to go get a prostitute  Who was a crackhead  And moved into his house  So I figured enough was enough  And decided to, you know, do something about it  He's the type of guy that's 
[03:15:30]  Always looking for something  You know, always looking for some excuse  On why he's, you know, next time he's going to stop  That's all addicts and alcoholics  Absolutely  You know, and so I called his  I called a family member of his  To try to  Me and a friend  Called a family member  To try to do some sort of intervention  And not to bust him up  But just to  You know, get somebody else  In the mix  So they know what's going on  So he can really help him  I know he wants to help  He's like  Look, I'm done  I'm sobering up  You know, all this  And I believe him 
[03:16:00]  But I still think he needs help  And, you know, now that he knows  I called the family member  He's not talking to me  And he's all pissed  And I get it  And I don't give a shit  You know  What is your question?  Because I think  It seems like you know what to do  You've got to do an intervention  I mean, or at least try an intervention  I guess, you know, am I  What else can I do?  Or what else should I do?  Or what else?  Well, that's the frustrating riddle  Is you can only do so much  There really is not a magic answer  Unfortunately 
[03:16:30]  An intervention is one thing  You and the family could probably try  But I think beyond that  What can you do?  You've made the phone calls to the family  Hopefully  How do I make him know  That I'm not a fucking dickhead  For doing this  And it's his best interest  And it's not  He'll come to know that  He'll come to know that  There's not much you can do  To make him  He can't recognize  That he's destroying his own life  Don't expect him to recognize  The intricacies of a friend  Trying to help 
[03:17:00]  And separating that from  A friend is ratting me out  So I wouldn't worry about that right now  He'll get over the anger at you  If he doesn't  Too bad for him  You're trying to help save his life  So I  It's always got a next time  Oh, I'll stop cheating on my girlfriend  When she starts sleeping with me  Or I'll do this  Or that  It's like, oh, I'm getting a new job tomorrow  So I'll stop doing coke  You know, it's like  Dude, I get it  And I know you have great intentions  To want to  But, you know, it's just like  It feels like you hit rock bottom now  And it's like  It's time to do something 
[03:17:30]  So I just  I had to make a phone call  You did what you could do  And hopefully you can do an intervention  But there's really not much more  You can do beyond that  And understand that  That is the greatest riddle  About addicts and alcoholics  What do we do to make them stop  And there is no magic  More importantly  Regarding me  My wife doesn't  Fucking give me a blowjob  I don't want a fucking blowjob  Well, why don't you call her family  And fucking do an intervention like that  Where they all sit around in a circle  And you pull your cock out  And she has to suck it in front of her parents  And explain what she's been missing 
[03:18:00]  Oh, God  Good luck, buddy  Thanks, buddy  Thank you  Shan  In Portland  Wants to talk about an STD  Hi, Shan  Hi  You can hear me, right?  I can, yes  Okay, good  Because I was told that  I need to speak up  Okay  I had sex with someone recently  And they told me they had genital warts  Okay  And I know you've talked about having STDs  But I don't know if you were joking  Or if you were serious  I've joked about it 
[03:18:30]  But I've joked about it  I caught, I think, chlamydia once or twice  But I've just taken, I think, penicillin for it  But that's years ago  So as far as warts are concerned  Very luckily I've never ever experienced that  But did they tell you before the sex?  No, they told me after  Oh, Jesus  And I heard someone else  Yeah  And I asked him about it  And he was like, oh yeah  It was like a year ago  And it was just a wart  Like one single one  And now I have to go get tested 
[03:19:00]  And apparently it's like HPV  And all I can do is visual checks  And like the most I can do is get a pap smear  And if it comes back abnormal  Then I might have it or not  Well, apparently a lot of men have it  And don't realize it  And I'm not familiar  This is a doctor question with a wart  Like are you obligated to tell someone  You have a wart  If you've had it removed  And you don't have it anymore  Is the virus  He never went to a doctor  Oh, he didn't  He never went to a doctor  No  Yeah, well, I'm not asking like the medical stuff  Oh, I know all that  Okay  But I'm just like 
[03:19:30]  I want to know how to deal with this  Because like it's ruining my life  Well, just go  First of all, go get tested  I mean, how can you deal with it?  What can you do?  I mean, you know  It was  Did you wear  Did you make him wear a condom?  Yeah  Well, then I don't know  If you have anything to worry about, do you?  Oh, I did  My mouth was on his penis  What's that?  My mouth was on his penis at one point, so  I don't  I mean  You've already  Let me ask you  How many dicks have you sucked in your life?  I'm not even being dirty  I mean, how many guys have you given that to? 
[03:20:00]  A lot  Like  Okay  So you've  Well over ten  What's that?  Well over ten?  So statistically  If it's any consolation  You have probably sucked an HPV dick before  And not known it  Huh?  If it's any consolation  Most people don't  I don't know about getting HPV from blowjobs  Because most blowjobs are given without rubbers  And most men don't know if they have it  Amy Schumer knows a lot about this  She talks about this in her act  I just don't know that much about it  I know I've never had an experience with it  That I'm aware of 
[03:20:30]  So lucky me  Yeah  Well good luck  I hope you're okay  Oh thank you  If you are okay  Email me  If not  Just don't call here again  I'm just kidding  Thank you very much  Goodbye to you  Good luck  Let's talk to Joe in New York  Thanks Jimmy  I kicked a five year heroin addiction  Because of the show  Oh that's great news  Hey Jimmy  How are you?  Good  Thank you buddy  Listen  I just  I know it sounds crazy  But all these weeks  Listening to your show  And hearing these people 
[03:21:00]  Call up with these problems  And how it's affecting this  And how it's affecting that  Really made me  Look at myself  And question everything  And I was hiding this  From everybody in my life  And I had like  A thousand dollar a week problem  Wow  And I just  You know  Started to just come out  And tell everybody  I told my girlfriend  I told my parents  And you know  I kicked it cold turkey  It's been like  Almost 30 days now  Good  And I feel great again  And I just want to thank you  Because it really did help  We saw you at Caroline's  And I was all fucked up  And you know  It was just a miserable time 
[03:21:30]  So  Have you gone to any  12 step meetings or anything?  I didn't  I went to a counseling center  In my town  Just to  You know  Because to be honest  The way that they handle this shit  They just give you other stuff  To make up for what you don't have  Right  So for me  I was so motivated  That I just had to stop  And just had to  You know  Go through the nonsense  And feel that pain  So that when it was over  I never want to go through it again  Okay  Well keep going  Do what you're doing  If you feel  Like  I can kind of  If your mind plays  A little tricks on you 
[03:22:00]  Just always remember  That there are  12 step programs there  If you find  You might want to try them  I have found them  To be very helpful  But  You know  It's up to you  But I'm happy to hear  That you're making  A great effort  That's fantastic man  Alright  Thanks Jimmy  Good luck buddy  And keep going  Bye  Jeff in North Dakota  You want to follow up  On advice  I gave you a month ago  Yeah  It's Jimmy  Happy birthday  Hi buddy  Thanks for calling  A couple months or so  I called  I was having an issue  With me and my wife  We'd have a threesome  With one of our friends  And I kind of just

[03:24:00]  I'm 23  Okay  Yeah  I know I'm good looking  I'm relatively funny  I mean I've  I've been on dates  I get laid  Not often  But I get laid  Decently enough  And every time  I try to get  To the next step  I either don't get  Like a third or fourth date  Or like if I've asked  A girl to be my girlfriend  I get a big no  I don't know  What the problem is  Well let me ask you  Now have you said  Will you be my girlfriend  Yeah  What I've found 
[03:24:30]  And you know  In the 50s  It was hey  Wear my jacket  Or I'll be your girl  It seems like  These days  You are boyfriend  And girlfriend  Before you acknowledge it  Like it seems  That people now  Will do a bunch of dates  And it kind of becomes  Casual  I think we're a  Commitment phobic society  And I'm certainly  A member of that  So it seems like  We kind of back  Into commitments now  Like all of a sudden  We're in a commitment  And then we'll go  Okay I'm not doing anything  Yeah I'm not doing  Anything either  I guess we won't 
[03:25:00]  As opposed to  Setting the parameters  Beforehand  Maybe just let it happen  Maybe you're rushing  It a little bit  Stop looking for the end game  Being the girlfriend  Just date  And let it happen  A little more naturally  And then maybe  By the time you're  On the seventh or eighth date  Then you might want to go  Like hey I'm not  Seeing anybody else  Are you seeing anybody else  Or how do you feel  Like as opposed to going  Could you be my girlfriend  And immediately putting  A label and a stamp on it  And fencing her in  That's another problem  I don't really get  To the seventh date  I mean it usually ends 
[03:25:30]  After a few dates  Well why not  Are you a bit over eager  I guess that may be  Part of the problem  Yeah I mean  I've won a relationship  Since I was a little kid  And it still hasn't happened  So I guess that's part of it  Yeah that's part of it  You know sometimes  Women can smell that  And for women  They don't like  What they see  As a desperate guy  We love a desperate woman  Because it means  We can fuck her  But women do not  Like a desperate guy  So you don't want  To give that off too much  If you're actually  A decent looking guy  And you're kind of funny 
[03:26:00]  You'll get a girlfriend  Just relax  And date a few  Different people at once  You know  I wouldn't suggest  Looking for the magic one  Try to keep a few  Different people  Going at one time  And then see which one  If any of them work out  Eventually one will do  You're not going to go  Through life without someone  Just don't panic  As much about it  Enjoy the dates  Believe me once you  Have a girlfriend  You're going to go  What the fuck  Did I want this for  Trust me  By the way  My sign to the  Despicable album  Is like my best  Pride possession  Thank you buddy  I'm glad you have it 
[03:26:30]  Thanks so much  Bye buddy  Anthony in Philly  Having a drinking problem  And you vomit all the time  I certainly relate to that  Hello Anthony  Yeah  I just  I drink  And then  Always in the morning  I'm throwing up  And I'm throwing up  When I'm eating  The night before  So then in the morning  Like right now  I'm like  An hour late for work  Because I just  Stay up drinking  And then  I don't  I don't  Like I  Right now the last thing  I want is a drink 
[03:27:00]  But I know when I get home  I'm going to  Want to drink more  And then I'm not going to eat  And I'm like  Getting too skinny  And people tell me  I just don't really know  How to stop  Like  I don't know  Well you  Obviously  It sounds like  You're an alcoholic  So it sounds  Because I used to vomit  Every night when I drank  I would put my fingers  Down my throat  There was almost  A bulimic to it  But it was to get it out  To get rid of the sickness  Or the spins  Yeah  Your life is unmanageable  Vomiting all the time  Is not normal or healthy 
[03:27:30]  It's your body  Is getting rid of a poison  So  Yeah  Do you really want to  Stop drinking  Do you want to stop  Vomiting and being late  For work  And being hung over  And having your whole life  Revolve around this  Shitty activity  Of course  Then you might want to try  Do you have insurance  No  Okay so you might  Rehab might be hard  Or you could find one  That would let you  Just come in  But basically  You want to get into  A facility  And you want to  Stop drinking  And you want to do  Something that alcoholics do  Have you ever been  To any 12 step meetings 
[03:28:00]  No  Maybe you should try one  Why don't you go online  Or call  And maybe  You know  Anyone you choose  There's AA is a big one  And there's some other ones  I guess  You know  And find one  And call it  And say look  I need help  And maybe somebody  Could take you to a meeting  Yeah  I think I need to  Yeah  Definitely talk to someone  It sounds like you do  And it sounds like a meeting  Would help you  A meeting certainly  Won't hurt you  Going to  Or a few meetings  Certainly 
[03:28:30]  Won't make your drinking  Any worse  Right  So if you're at this place  Where you're just  Not enjoying life anymore  And it doesn't sound  Like that's fun dude  No  But you can get off  As they say  The elevator  It only goes down  It never goes back up  But you can get off  Anytime you want  Right  That's a good point  I just really got to  Grab by the balls  Or something  But you know  I'm like a normal dude  Like I like jokes  And like shit  Makes me laugh  And stuff  It's just  I don't enjoy  Going out with my friends 
[03:29:00]  And drinking any longer  Because I know  I'm just  It's like an excuse  To drink when they want to  Sure  And it's also  You know  Once the party is over  And we're still doing it  And we're still  Fucking abusing ourselves  It's just  You get to a point  Where you're like  Why am I doing this  And then you can't  Answer the question  But you do it anyway  It's complete  And utter insanity  It never  There's nothing good  Ever going to come out of it  It is just  It's wrecking everything  That is probably good around you  What you're drinking 
[03:29:30]  Is doing to you  Is what my sex addiction  Does to me  You know what I mean  It's  Yeah  So I would just suggest  Calling one of those things  And going to a meeting  Because it's certainly  Not going to hurt  Okay  Yeah I think that's  The right call man  You're right  Alright well I'm glad  You called man  Good luck buddy  Stop vomiting  Thank you  Okay  Alright I will  Alright bye  Let's see  Rob in Atlanta  Question about stand up  And writer's block  I'm sure a lot of people  Even if they don't do stand up  Write blogs or whatever  And have writer's block  Yes Rob  Hi  Hi  I've been doing stand up 
[03:30:00]  For about four months now  Cool  And I'm sick of the same  Five minutes  Sure  And I'm trying to come up  With some new stuff  But you know  So I've kind of  Most of my jokes  Are kind of about myself  Sure  I've kind of run out of stuff  To talk about  For any kind of advice  Or I guess tricks  To kind of  Get the ball rolling  Well you're still  Very new in the game  And that matters  Because what happens  Is your comfort level  On stage grows  As time goes on 
[03:30:30]  And you begin  To get more comfortable  Just kind of  Going off book a little  Even if you don't know  Where your destination  Is going to be  And you learn  How to rein in something  When it's bombing  And you learn how to  Like say I have a joke  Where I talk about  A relationship  And I go  From my relationship  Into sex  Okay that was my segue  My girlfriend  And man do I like  To eat pussy  That's how I'm doing it  But now I want to talk  About going to Aruba  Fuck  How do I do that  Maybe  And this is what 
[03:31:00]  Experience teaches you  While I'm talking  About my girlfriend  I can use like  A little segue  And go you know  I want to go to Aruba  With her  And then do my bit  On Aruba  And then somehow  Just quickly mention  The girlfriend  And use that again  To segue into sex  Meaning  I sandwich it  Between two bits  That already work  And I take that  Aruba risk  In the middle  So that's one way  I do it  But again  That comes with  Being very comfortable  On stage  And risking bombing  And when something  Is bombing  Not allowing it  To spiral my entire  Set out of control 
[03:31:30]  We all get  Writer's block  I'm not good  At just sitting down  I mean  Colin can make  Can make himself right  Colin can sit  In front of a computer  I don't know  How the fuck  He does it  I wish I had  The ability  To do what he does  Because that's why  He gets so much  Shit done  And so much  New material  I'm just not  As good at that  And I'm sure  He tries it on stage  Just off the cuff  Too  But I try to  Just go on  And like I said  Just in the middle  Of something  I'll take a left turn  Knowing what  I'm coming back to 
[03:32:00]  So half the time  Is doing new material  The scary part  Is you don't know  What you're going  To come back to  So if you know  That you got this  Fucking good bit  After  And this good bit  Before  Just find a way  To segue it  In between  But don't worry  The writer's block  Will clear up  You're not going to  Have it forever  Hey Jim  Thanks a lot  I love the show  Alright good luck  Ben that's great  I run in a  I run a movie night  And a movie show  Okay let's see  Aaron in New Mexico  Hi Aaron  I'm not sure  I run a movie night  And a movie I'm showing  The director blew a kid 
[03:32:30]  And I was wondering  If I should show it or not  Oh okay  Hi Aaron  You run a movie night now  Is it a local movies?  No it's a website  Called killerreviews.com  And we run a  Friday night movie nights  And just show horror movies  And people just show up  And chat  Now don't say  The director's name  Don't say the director's name  Because I don't want  To get sued  But let's just say  If you do this time  It's okay  It's on Wikipedia  It's fine  Okay well  Whatever whoever he is  Should you show his movies  Because he blew a kid 
[03:33:00]  Yeah people are like  I don't want to show up  Because he did this movie  Called The Clown House  And he blew the lead actor  Who was a kid  Who was like 13  And people were like  I'm not going to show up  And I'm just like  Look you watch  Rosemary's Baby  And Polanski  Fuck the girl in the ass  Right  Alienate my group  Or you know what I mean  Hard  And again  I have to say this  For my own safety here  I don't know who directed  That movie  And I don't know  If what you're saying is true  I'm just  You're saying it  So again  It may or may not be true  I don't know  But let's just say  In general  Roman Polanski 
[03:33:30]  Is a good example  Because everybody knows  That Roman Polanski  Actually did do that  It's amazing to me  In Hollywood  How if you say the word  You know  Nigger or faggot  Or whatever  You get a lot of flack  And you're blackballed  But they can't line up  Fast enough  To work with Roman Polanski  Even if they know  What he did  People's morality  Is very selective  So if you feel  Hey  If this director  Did what you said he did  And he went to jail for it  And he did his crime  Paid for his crime  And you want to show the movie  Then feel free to show 
[03:34:00]  Totally judgment call  I don't think there's any  Right or wrong answer  Personally  I wouldn't  I wouldn't like  Promoting a pedophile  But again  I like Roman Polanski's movies  And I'll watch them  So  You could take  The school of thought  I'm not going to allow  His personal life  Like hey  Mike Tyson  Was convicted of rape  Whether or not he did it  I mean now I believe  That he actually didn't do it  But  He was convicted  In a court of law  And you know what  I still love when he comes in here  And I still like Mike Tyson  So 
[03:34:30]  We at times  Can look beyond  At awful things  People have done  Or  If you feel that  None of the people  Who are enjoying  Your service  Are going to watch it  Because this guy  Did this  Then don't show it  It's a complete business decision  From you  Pedophilia is a weird one  Or the allegations  Of pedophilia  It's a lot different  Than most crimes  At least to me  To kind of give you  To give you a little bit  Of background  This guy did  Jeepers Creepers  I'm sure you've heard  Of those horror movies  I have not  No  And the guy  The guy did his time  Well again 
[03:35:00]  Again  I don't want to reference  Who he is  I'm not  I'm not shitting on you  I'm just telling you  I don't want to reference  Who the guy is  Because I don't know  Enough about this  And even though  You're calling in  I don't want to be  Co-signing that a guy  Might have sucked  A 13 year old's dick  I don't know if he did  So don't mention his movies  Simply because  I don't know  What the truth of that is  But I appreciate your call  I would only suggest  Do what your conscience dictates  If somebody committed a crime  And did their time  And you feel like  Fuck it  They did their time 
[03:35:30]  Then show their work  If you feel like  Fuck him  He's a pedophile  If you feel like  Fuck him  He's a pedophile  I don't want to  Show him  Then don't  But thank you for the call buddy  And I hate to be so paranoid  About legal stuff  But when  If someone is calling up  And referencing a person  And saying that they did  Something like that  If it's Polanski  I know the story  But this guy  Just don't know the story  So I gotta be careful with that  Alright whatever  I made my point  You all fucking get it  Patty in Tennessee  Wants to fill me in 
[03:36:00]  On HPV  Hello Patty  Hello  Hi  How you doing  Good Patty  Yeah I just wanted to  Tell you that  Well first of all  Hey what's your last name  Cakes or something  Fucking double bakers  You're so funny  Thank you  I saw you in Nashville  You were freaking amazing  Thank you Patty  So anyway  My husband just got treated  For cancer  For squamous cell carcinoma  On his tonsil  And it was because of HPV 
[03:36:30]  Oh wow  Oh my god  I've heard you can get it  From eating pussy  That's right  Fuck  I have heard that  Oh Patty  That fucking horrifies me  Yeah I know  I know  And I didn't come back  Positive for HPV  Until last year  And we've been married  For almost 14 years  Oh wow  That's fucking scary  Yeah  And you cannot  Protect yourself  With a condom  From HPV  Oh you can't  It's like  Okay  It's like herpes  You can or can't  It depends on where it is  It also doesn't depend 
[03:37:00]  Where the  If somebody's active  Okay  If their disease is active  You can't protect yourself  Against it  Okay well thank you  For saying that Patty  Again I don't know  Enough about the  Do you want to get  Dr. Steve on  To talk about this  I'd rather get  Fucking Dr. Kevorkian on  HPV  What does that mean  Hats  I couldn't think of  A PV model  All right  Thank you very much Patty  Yeah I would actually  Love to ask Dr. Steve  The great Dr. Steve 
[03:37:30]  I don't even want to  Call him Dr. Steve anymore  His name should be  The great Dr. Steve  Because he is a truly  Compassionate and good doctor  We're calling him now  All right well fuck him  Who else we got  I'm sorry  I'm looking at my  Roger Dolce picture  Instead of the fucking screen  I'm sorry  I really was not  Doing my job  Now let's go to  Mike in Ohio  Me and my wife  Had a kid  Sex life  She's not into it  Hi Mike  How you doing  Good buddy  How are you  Oh pretty good  My son's about  Seven months old now  Before we got pregnant 
[03:38:00]  Our sex life was  Just unbelievable  Constantly  I'm only home  About four nights a week  So you know  I kind of make up for it  When I'm home  From when I'm not  Kid comes along  Of course I understand  You know that  There's healing process  Sure  Whatever  So you know  Once you got to the point  To where we could actually  Have intercourse normally  Without being cautious  And whatever  A little bit into it 
[03:38:30]  Oh it hurts  Or I'd see a look  On her face  And just totally  Not into it  Which totally  Turned me off  Oh shit yeah  I mean even for a while  After that  I just had even  No desire  To even masturbate  For that  And then  You know  Slowly  Physician wise  It's basically  Like missionary  Or  Or  Shoes on top  And that's it  Anytime  Other than that  Want to do anything else 
[03:39:00]  Oh it hurts  Or it burns  Or  You know  Goes to the gynecologist  Everything's fine  So I'm not sure  If it's some sort  Of psychological thing  Or yeast infection  Maybe  Have you asked her  Did she want to have sex?  Well yeah  And you know  She might say  You know  I'm not really  Feeling like it  But you know  I'll go ahead  And pleasure you  Well you know  That's all fine  And dandy  But for me  I don't see my wife  Enjoying it  I don't enjoy it 
[03:39:30]  As much  I mean any man  Is still going to  Ejaculate  And have an orgasm  Or whatever  But I take  Satisfaction  And I get off  By knowing that  My wife is  Having satisfaction  And getting off  Yeah  It's difficult  Again  I think people  React differently  To having kids  And there's obviously  Dr. Steve  You know  We're going to  Drop your call  I'm going to  Take Dr. Steve  And we're going  To address what you said  Because he may know  More about this  Than I do  We're going to  Ask him about HPV  So thank you  For the call  So Dr. Steve 
[03:40:00]  Yes ma'am  Two questions  We have one guy  Who just called  Who was saying  That since his wife  Had the kids  Seven months  She's complaining  About a burning  Or she's not  Enjoying the sex  Is that normal  Or do you think  That's just something  To do with the dynamics  Of their marriage  Well it's not normal  Pain  Painful intercourse  Is called  Disperunia  And  As opposed to  That perunia  Fuck yeah  It's a perunia show  Cocksuckers  I love perunia juice  I'm sorry 
[03:40:30]  Move your bowels  This is not funny stuff  Let's get to the meat  Of the issue  Yeah it's  She could have had  Some birth trauma  When that giant head  Passed through  Her small vaginal canal  And there could be  Some scar tissue there  Or even some  Residual inflammation  And she just needs  To go to her  OBGYN  And say  Look now  Since I had this  Kid  Every time I have sex  I have pain  And there are things  That they can do  About that 
[03:41:00]  Okay  And I hope that helps  The guy who called  And because he doesn't  Think his wife's  Enjoying sex  Could be postpartum  Depression or whatever  Well sure  I mean  Yeah it could be  Multifactorial  And you know  If she had a vaginal  Delivery and had a lot  Of pain with that  She may be associating  Having sex with him  With having a lot  Of pain  Nine months later  So that could be  Weighing on her  Psychologically as well  And we had a couple  Calls about HPV  This girl called up  And said that she  Fucked a guy 
[03:41:30]  Who turned out  Had a wart  Or something  And she blew him  But he wore a condom  When they had sex  And she's freaking out  And I said  Well that most men  Don't have  They know they have HPV  So you've probably  Blown HPV before  Without knowing it  And this other woman  Called up and said  That her husband  Had tonsil cancer  From eating her pussy  Not knowing she had HPV  And she didn't know it  So I guess we just  Wanted a little bit  About HPV  And protecting yourself  With a condom or no  Yeah  Yeah  It's very  Very common  HPV is the virus 
[03:42:00]  That causes genital warts  But it also  Causes plantar warts  And warts on your hands  Too  And there are a few  Subtypes of HPV  That can cause cancer  Cervical cancer  Head and neck cancer  That kind of stuff  So that's why  We're recommending  That everybody  Of you know  That is under the age  Of 20 something  Get the Gardasil vaccine  Because it vaccinates 
[03:42:30]  Against the really nasty  Versions of HPV  That can cause cancer  Why can't we  Vaccinate against it  At our age?  Well because we've  Probably already  Been exposed to it  I mean you could  But they're just  Trying to  They're trying to  Get this next generation  To be completely  Free of these  Viruses  So  And you know  These fucking people  Are like  Oh well  You want us to  Vaccinate 12 year old  Girls  You're encouraging them  To have sex  It's like  No asshole  We're trying to  Catch them  Before they get  The HPV 
[03:43:00]  So we want to  Get these girls  When they're  When they're really  Young  And men too now  And it's  It's the first  Cancer vaccine  That we have  And there's a  Really good chance  That we can reduce  The incidence of  Cervical and head  And neck cancer  Dramatically through this  But for the rest of us  We've just got to  Protect ourselves  Now most people  Have been exposed  To HPV already  You know  And a condom  Definitely will make  A difference  If the warts  Are in a place  That can be  Protected by the condom  Right 
[03:43:30]  But if they're  On the nose  It doesn't help  Exactly  The on the nose  Or on the ball sack  And it's slapping  Against the girl's  The next thing you know  She's got HPV there  So yeah  It's a little rough  Same thing  With herpes  Herpes won't always  Be in a place  That can be  Completely  Controlled  With a  With a condom  Right  And that's how  People can transmit  Even if they're  Wearing a bag  Sure  Yeah you  You know  You get a blowjob  From somebody  With a cold sore  And you may  Get herpes 
[03:44:00]  On your neck  So  So I guess  The beautiful  Lesson here is  If you're married  Stay married  Because it's a  Fucking jungle  Out there  It's a viral  Jungle my friend  Thank you Steve  Very much  Okay  Hey thanks man  Bye buddy  Weird medicine  The great  Dr. Steve  Saturdays at 9  Yes  And there's a guy  Calling up here  Who's saying  My wife has  The same issue  With having sex  After a bubby  Brian  No no no  I'm sorry  That's Joe  In Babylon  Let's hope that  Joe doesn't  Babylon  Right  How you doing Jimmy  Welcome aboard Joe 
[03:44:30]  How's everything  Good buddy  So what happened  With your wife  She had  We had a  Nine pound baby  Jesus  And  Yeah huge kid  And  She had the same  Pains  And our doctor  Said  That  She  She fractured  Her pelvic bone  During sex  Because of the  Size  I mean not during  During the birth  Yeah  So  She had  Pains  During  During intercourse 
[03:45:00]  And I'm not a big guy  So  It's not  It's not the size  It's  It's  More because the baby  Broke through  So what finally  Happened  How did you  Remedy the situation  You just keep on  Working at it  Okay  And it will get better  It does get better  And  It's just like  Any bone  It heals  They can't put a  Cast around it  Of course  Sure  So  They  They just keep on  Plugging along  Okay  Thank you very much  Man  And I'm glad  It worked out for you  Be good  Let's see 
[03:45:30]  Somebody  Bill in Boston  Says  What's it like  To be sober  Around people  Who have  Addictive personalities  Yes Bill  Hey Jim  I'd first like to say  I saw you in New Hampshire  A year ago  And it's one of the  Funniest nights of my life  Thank you  Yeah people tell me  When I perform  It's akin to magic  I love it  Thank you buddy  As a comedian  Who's clean and sober  What is it like  To have other people  Around you  That have  Addictive personalities  It must be tough  To struggle with 
[03:46:00]  The balance of being  Their nanny  And wanting to help people  And still wanting  To be a friend  Is that difficult for you  No I'll tell you why  A couple reasons  One I still have  An addictive personality  So I relate to them  But the people still using  Like drinking and drugs  I'm not a wet nurse  And I don't save people  You know I try to  Lead by example  Like people know  I'm sober  But I'm not the  Fucking bleeding deacon  To people  You need to stop  You need to  You know you need  To quit smoking  Or whatever 
[03:46:30]  They see me  And how I conduct  My life  With the imperfections too  And if they want  What I have  Which again  For all the bad things  I do  I'm not going to  Drive into a pole  And kill a family  Because I'm drunk  You know what I mean  There's a lot to be said  For being sober  From alcohol and drugs  So I hope that they  See that and recognize that  And want that  And then I talk to them  If they ask me  No it's not difficult  And I really mean this  I learn more from them  Than they will ever learn  From me  Because I know  What it's like  To be sober 
[03:47:00]  But they remind me  What it's like  To still be out there  And when I see  The irrational decisions  They make  I watch some creative  Geniuses that I know  And I know some  Brilliant people  Who make these  Fucking shit decisions  Because they're always  In that fucking  Even if they're not  Drinking that second  They're active  They're actively addicted  And they're behaving  Like an active addict  So I watch the way  Their lives spiral  Out of control  And I learn  From watching them  I learn from watching  Because I don't need to know 
[03:47:30]  Like gee what would happen  If I drank  Because I'm no better  Than the guy  Who's drinking right now  I watch what happens  He gets a fucking DWI  Like Kevin Hart  My friend Kevin Hart  Who I don't know  To be a drinker at all  I don't know Kevin  For a long time  So he could be  One of those guys  That just had a bad night  You know what I mean  He could be a guy  Who's not an alcoholic  Who just you know  Look  Fucked up one night  Which happens  But I think to myself  That would be me  Almost every night  And when you look  At the insanity of that  Risking everything 
[03:48:00]  Doing 90 miles an hour  In a Mercedes drinking  When you have this  Beautiful life  This great career  Making millions of dollars  And how fast  That could be taken away  Over something senseless  I learned from watching that  Even when shit that's bad  Doesn't happen  I go fuck  Thank god  I am not  Taking chances like that  And I'm only using Kevin  As an example  Because he's a guy  With a great career  Who just got a DUI recently  Or Tracy  Or whoever you want to use  So that's how I do it buddy  I learn from them  And I try to learn 
[03:48:30]  From watching people  Make mistakes  Even if they're not  Life altering  Or life ruining mistakes  I still like  Maybe I wouldn't be  That lucky  I'm not the luckiest guy  As you could tell  Lucky Louie was cancelled  Opie and Anthony's show  Originally was cancelled  The fucking  Tough crowd was cancelled  Believe me  When I'm involved with things  They tend to fail  So if I was still drinking  I would not have  The good luck  To just get pulled over  Doing 90  Something bad would happen  So  Well this is a great show  And we appreciate the advice  And I think it's probably  Helping people  But look at the success 
[03:49:00]  You've had  I mean you've got  A sold out weekend  Coming up in Florida  No I don't  But thank you  Well have a good weekend  Jim  Thank you buddy  I'll tell you one thing  The ability to do  One of the greatest  Sober lessons I've gotten  Is the ability  To do things  That I don't want to do  In the moment  Like the reason  I come to work  Is I have that  Dial  Like this morning  I had that dial  I always joke about it  Like  But I'm like  Fuck it  I love this job  And I'm obligated  To be there  So I make myself 
[03:49:30]  Do shit that I don't want to do  Instead of always  Giving in to myself  Always giving in to myself  And as a result  I was here today  When Roger Daltrey showed up  Like  My 12 step sponsor  Said to me  That 90% of life  Is showing up  And he was right  And  You know  That's something  I can only achieve  Being sober  So I hope that people  Who are drinking  Learn from that  Because I certainly  Learned the wrong way  To do it from watching you  And I don't mean  That I'm better than you  I just learned  From watching you  And since you mentioned Florida  Do you want to plug  Your Jacksonville gig again  Yeah tomorrow 
[03:50:00]  Through Saturday  I will be in Jacksonville  Let's see  I need advice  At the funny boat  I broke up with my girl  Because of emails  I sent  Daffy  Is that Daffy  Or Dave  It's  It's  Dave  It's basically  Dave with an F  Oh Dave  Hello Dave  Hey Chip  How are you doing  Hey  Hey what's up Dave  I'm actually calling  From Regina  The city  That sounds like  It smells  Hey Chip  Fuck yeah  That's like calling up  For a bunt  Or a tootsie  That's right 
[03:50:30]  That's right  Go ahead  You daffy bastard  You daffy  Daffy  What's up buddy  You broke up  With your girl  Because of an email  What do you mean  Well basically  What happened  Was he's literally  A girl in my dream  She got me off  Some bad shit  Put me on the right path  And about a month ago  Shit was pretty rough  In the water  So me being the retard  I was emailing a chick  Saying all the profanities  Sharing dick pics  All that fun stuff  Sure  And nothing followed through  It was all just talk  You know  You mentioned in the past 
[03:51:00]  You talk about the chase  Yeah  And I never went through  With anything  It's the second time  I've done it  And I just need  Some help Jimmy  How long you been  With the girl  About two and a half  Three years  Okay so is she  Willing to stay with you  Even though you  Might be an addict  She actually  She's going to go home  About three hours away  We're going to try  A distance thing  She kind of has to  Get her shit together  And I need to get  My shit together  Okay so now  And again this is  Something I still  Struggle with  So I can tell you 
[03:51:30]  What I know about it  It sounds like  If it's hurting  Good things in your life  It could be an addiction  And if you're calling up  And saying I genuinely  Want to do something  About it  There are a bunch  Of 12 step  Sexual programs  And a lot of them  Have different  Parameters and guidelines  But you can easily  Look them up  And go  And you'll find  You'll hear something  That you can  There's a program  Called S-L-A-A  Sex and Love Addicts  Anonymous  Which is  A lot of people 
[03:52:00]  Have had great success  In that one  You might want to  And I believe  That there's  Sex S-C-A  S-A  There's a whole  Shit load of them  So  You know  I was looking  At counters  And stuff  In Regina  And  But no  I do got to  Kind of  Follow up  With a specialist  I mean  I really want  This chick man  Like big time  Okay  Well you can't  You can't  You know  We try to recover  For ourselves  With things  But not other people  But a lot  You know  Hey look  My dad got sober  In 1970 
[03:52:30]  In a program  Because my mom  Left him  And I think  That's what it was  You know  The marriage was terrible  And there was violence  In the marriage  And she left  And he said  Fuck it  I'll go  You know  Just to kind of  Save things  And it wound up  Working  And he wound up  Staying  So whatever  Gets you in  Is all that matters  So I would suggest  Trying a few meetings  And seeing how  That works for you  But it's good though  That you realize  It's fucking your life up  And you're not just  Blaming her irrationally  And you realize  You did something stupid  Yeah man  It's me for sure  And like I said  Like I mean  We love each other  It's just 
[03:53:00]  She's got to go home  She's got to get  Her shit together  And I got to  Screw my head on  I mean yeah  That means I get  A house alone  For the first time  In my life  But it's what I do  In that house  Sure  Really  You know  I can't just sit there  And whack off  Like a bazillion times  A day  And pretend I'll get better  No because it really is  Dude it really is  A way of isolating  And not living  And I do that again  This time  I'm like I wasted  My whole day  Just looking at pornography  Or obsessing sexually  You know me buddy  It's a frustrating part  Of my life  Because people who don't  Think it's an addiction  Oh you just can't wait 
[03:53:30]  You don't get it  You don't understand  The obsession  Or what it can do to you  And it's gotten worse  With smart phones  And all these  I'm an IT guy man  That's kind of  You know  Like I deal with  With different people  All day  And both of the people  I've done shit with  Is fucking co-workers  From offices  Super far away  That I'll never be able to see  I mean I can if I go there  Yeah I understand  It's the intrigue  It's called intriguing  And I definitely get it  But alright  Go to a meeting man  It sounds like you're ready  To do something about it 
[03:54:00]  So I give you credit  You're the fucking best buddy  I really mean it  I woke up  She texted me  She said call Jimmy  And guess what I did  Thanks man  Alright buddy  Good luck  And Mike in DC  Wants to give me  He's getting his five year chip  What's that  In a few weeks  What's up Mike  What's up  Jimmy  Hey man  Long time listener bro  I always enjoy when you talk  About sobriety and recovery  And all that good stuff  I'm a member of a 12 step program  Picking up a five year chip  Memorial Day weekend  So  That's great dude 
[03:54:30]  Congratulations  And it feels  You know when people say  Why do you guys celebrate  You get pieces or chips  Or whatever  It's really  It's a landmark  Of doing something good  For yourself  And it's a really healthy thing  And for all the things  I've done wrong  And continue to do wrong  And I'm sure you relate to this  The one thing  I did right  Is the absolute  Most important thing  I could do right  And it was not  To pick up  Indeed brother  That's the name of the game  And well  That's all I got brother 
[03:55:00]  I love you very much  Thank you  You're great on the radio  And peace out  Thank you  And congratulations man  That's terrific  I'm really always happy  To fucking hear that  And I try to bounce around  People say  Well you guys  A lot of guys  Call in and just talk  About a few different subjects  But that's the way  Any advice show is  When you look and say  Dr. Drew and Carolla  They had a great show  Love line  You know  Everyone's calling in  About sexual love  This one at least  We mix in with some  Comedy questions  Or whatever  Who wanted to ask  I wanted to ask Jim  About comedy  And being a comedian  Adam and PA  We'll touch on that  For a moment  Hello Adam 
[03:55:30]  How are you  Hey what's up  Hi buddy  Yeah yeah yeah  I always really wanted  To be a comic  Like I just didn't  Really know how to go  About it  Like God  You know  What I did  Here's what I'll suggest  To you and anybody else  Who wants to be a comic  It's all I ever wanted  When I was 12 years old  I knew  And I said  I wanted to be a lawyer  When I was in high school  Because the reality was  That seemed feasible  And comedy seemed like  This stupid pipe dream  But if you want to try comedy 
[03:56:00]  What you should do  Is write down things  You think are funny  Just write them down  You have to put them  In front of you at first  Find what we call  A new talent night  Or an open mic night  And go down one night  And sign up  And you may have to  Bring a few friends  Take the risk  And try it  That's my advice  Try it  You don't know  If you're going to be good at it  For the first 10 times  You don't even know  If you're going to be good at it  But you should try it  Because there will never come a day 
[03:56:30]  When you wake up  Where the fear is gone  And you go  Today is the magic day  And it just happens  You have to do it  You have to go down  You have to sign up  You have to do the research  And find the place  You have to write the ideas down  So I would suggest  Doing that stuff  And taking the step  Because it won't be taken for you  Okay?  Ah, thanks  But good luck to you  Understand being afraid  Is normal  You're an asshole  If you're not afraid  You're supposed to be afraid 
[03:57:00]  If you weren't afraid  There'd be 250,000 comedians  But that's why  There's a limited number  Who do well  Because it's the fear of bombing  That stops people  So I would suggest  Go up there  And give it a shot  And good luck to you  My friend  And the worst case scenario  Is it's not what you're meant to do  But you'll never regret  Trying it a bunch of times  I'm telling you  Let's talk to  Bill from Pennsylvania  Who's been diagnosed  With post-traumatic stress disorder 
[03:57:30]  And needs a remedy for sleep  Hi, Bill  How you doing?  Good, buddy  How are you?  I'm a Marine  I've been on the surface  I was in the Marines  In the 70s  Okay  And I fought overseas  And stuff  And I lost everything  I've been sober now  For 20  27 years  Oh, great, man  And the thing is  I've recently been diagnosed  With post-traumatic disorder 
[03:58:00]  And my therapist says  It's because of the war  And stuff  And she said  I'm subconsciously  Trying to commit suicide  Okay  And  But I have a hard time now  Lately  It's been like a year now  I just  Can't go to sleep  I'll  Lay down  Try to go to sleep  And I just  Stay up  And I just  Start panicking about  The next day 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  And stuff like that  You panic  You're going to be tired  All day  The next day  And then you look  At the clock  And you get angry  At yourself  I can't fucking sleep  And you start to dread  Laying down at night  Yeah  Yeah  Especially if I know  I drive truck  And I know  I got to get up  Early to pee somewhere  You know what I mean  Now  I'm already panicking  About it  And  They don't know  What to do about it  In the VA  They just don't know  They want to  Give me all sorts of drugs  And I won't do it  I'm not 
[03:59:00]  Tell them that's my sobriety  I tell them that  You know what I mean  Yeah I won't take Ambien  Or any of that stuff either  Bill  That scares me  That type of stuff  And plus for us as addicts  It wouldn't work that long  And it worked for a little while  Then you'd have to just  Double and triple it  Then it would just  Stop working anyway  Yeah  Because when I was  Drinking and stuff  I was wrecking cars  And stuff like that  And  I drank constantly  Let me ask  I'm sorry  I apologize  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Bill  Let me ask you  Because I don't know  Enough about PTSD  Because again  I've never experienced it  This sounds like 
[03:59:30]  A dumb question  But one of the reasons  My sleep doctor and I talked  And I have  Terrible  Sleep habits  Where I go to bed  At different times  I'm sexually addicted  So my wiring  Is all fucked up  At night  I drink Diet Coke  Later than I should  I do weird stuff  Do you exercise?  No  I do a little bit  But not that much  Because I drive truck  I'm usually in the truck  All the time  I'm usually in the truck  I'm usually in the truck  A week at a time 
[04:00:00]  You know  I really don't get time  I walk  And stuff like that  But  You might want to do something  And make yourself  A little more tired  Do you drink a lot of caffeine?  No  I have my three cups of coffee  In the morning  That's it  Yeah  That's pretty much what I do  How about  Do you eat like fruit  Late at night?  No  No  I don't know anything like that  Okay  So maybe it's not  Physiological  Or physical  I just said physiological  To make me sound smarter  Maybe it's just not  Anything you're doing  If it's PTSD  That's something  I have no experience in  But I know that  There is a way 
[04:00:30]  To live with it  Are you thinking  About the war  And stuff  Or you just  Don't feel tired?  Sometimes I have  Flashbacks  Of what I did  You know what I mean  And that's coming out  In therapy now  And I haven't  Really thought about it  In years  I just started thinking  More and more about it  When I've been sober  I left my wife over it  And everything like that  Okay Bill  So maybe that is  What it is  And maybe  That weird little door  Is being  Is  You know  Kind of creeping open  Maybe  That door is opening 
[04:01:00]  And all this stuff  Is popping  Is rolling out  Or whatever  Coming out from under it  So maybe this is a good thing  As much as it's frustrating  Maybe you're getting rid of something  And like you know how  When you're vomiting  It never feels good  Until you're done  So  Keep going to the therapist  Maybe this is your mind's way  Of vomiting out this poison  What buddy?  One of the therapists  Was recommending hypnosis  Yeah  To try to get to my subconscious  Have you ever tried  Anything like that?  I tried hypnosis 
[04:01:30]  When I was a teenager  Because I was having  Erection  You know what  It was hard to put me under  But again  I was young  And you know  I might have been like  19 or whatever  Because I was having  Erection difficulties  So I thought that  That would  Fucking  Instead I didn't know enough  About my own sexuality  Or the fact that  Like hey  I just don't want to have sex  At this moment  So I would suggest  Try the hypnosis  It can't  I don't think it'll hurt you  Okay  But it sounds like  You're on the right road dude  You're sober  And just because we're sober  You know how it is man  Stuff doesn't get better overnight  And if that's PTSD in there 
[04:02:00]  And that stuff is coming out  Then I think it's great  That it's starting to come out  And you fucking  Maybe open that door  And air it out  And then things will be better  Yeah I'm a little bit nervous  I'm scared about it  Yeah it's  Bill it's already in there  It's not  You're not putting anything  Extra in there  You're just getting  Getting rid of shit  That you're not  As they say  Yeah  You're going to be okay  But keep going  To the therapist buddy  I'm happy you're sober  Alright thanks  Okay bye buddy  We have three minutes left  Jerry in Georgia  Says he can help the vet  Who is on the line  Hello Jerry 
[04:02:30]  Hey man  Hi buddy  Therapy is correct  Therapy therapy therapy  I stopped for  Post-traumatic stress disorder  I'm a desert storm vet  Okay  Man  There's tons of therapies  You need to get with  A therapist at the VA  They have immersion therapies  They have  Desensitization training  Therapy  I mean I'm going through it now  I understand completely  How he feels  I don't sleep  When I do sleep  I fight  Toss and turn  My wife hates it  It's just sticking it out man  You know I mean 
[04:03:00]  He just needs to stick it out  And get with the VA people  And get into the therapy  And stick with the therapy  If he can stick with sobriety  He can stick with therapy  If he can do both  He'll be fine  And work through it  Did you find that like  Did you find that that was  A lot of that bad stuff  Kind of coming out  Like that door opening  And then once you get rid of it  It's kind of easier  To live with it  Brother I can't live with it  I'm suffering myself from it  No no I mean  I mean the memories of it  Or what you're talking about  Yeah  It's  You know the thing is  With post-traumatic stress  It's not necessarily always 
[04:03:30]  Just the memories man  I mean  There's so much stuff in there  That it's being out of control  You know  You can't rectify  Being out of control  Of your life  And that's part of what kills you  You know what I mean  Because  There were things that happened  That you just absolutely  Have no control over  And  A guy like me man  I mean  I'm type A personality man  I mean  I control everything in my life  I'm on guard all the time  I'm watching over my shoulders  I watch the rear view mirror  Being out of control  For those few seconds  You know  During  During the 
[04:04:00]  You know  A nine month deployment  Has  Screwed my life up  Unimaginably  Yeah  Well  At least you are  Getting help for it  I mean  That's always  I always  I like to hear  That someone's  At least doing something  You know  Because it can't be worse  While you're doing something  Than it is  If you're not doing something  Right on  So good luck man  I hope you're okay Jerry  Thanks for the call  Yeah good luck to Bill too man  Yeah hopefully Bill in Pennsylvania  Heard that  We have one minute left  I don't want to leave  But we have to  So Jim in North Carolina  Quickly dating  Your buddy's ex-wife 
[04:04:30]  You need help  She's got a past  Okay  Hey buddy  Real quick  She used to abuse coke  She was a stripper  For a while  She's a wonderful mother  Of three kids  I've got a past myself  From deployments  And shit I'm not proud of  What I'm trying to get over  Is this nagging  Almost jealousy  What the fuck is going on  What is she doing this minute  I just need to  Trust her  Well let me ask you quickly  Did she make  Advances towards you  Or did you have a flirt  With her while she was  With her ex  With your buddy 
[04:05:00]  No there was definitely  Sexual tension  Between the two of us  But we were very close friends  Okay but you felt  That sexual tension  So there was something  Going on between you  And her that was  Unspoken  That the friend  That was behind his back  In a way  In a sense  Yeah I mean  We were foursome  I'm a widower  And she and my wife  Were best friends  So I mean  In a sense  Yes but this is going  Back ten years  And you know  We just kindled  This romantic side  Of the relationship  How long have they been split  Five years  Okay is he okay with it 
[04:05:30]  He's remarried  As a kid  Okay  My only suggestion  Or thought could be  That either  A she's behaving  Suspiciously  B you just don't  Trust people  Because you do things  That are fucking  A little bit duplicitous  Which we all do  I don't trust people  Okay  Or it could be  A combination  Maybe  Because you've seen her  And you've been with her  In a situation  Where you were both  Sending out signals  Under the radar  Of the other two people 
[04:06:00]  So you were both  Being slightly deceptive  Even though I get  Why you would do that  And it would be  A sexy thing  Maybe now that  You're with her  You assume she'll do that  With somebody else  Yeah probably  So sometimes  You know  It's almost like  I just need to break it down  And allow myself  To trust her  I think is what's going on  Yeah well if she's  Trustworthy  You should trust her  As long as you're behaving  In a trustworthy fashion  It'll probably be easier  To trust her  Yeah  Thank you very much buddy  And sorry to cut you off  We have to go  Let me see  The guy who needed to  Talk about letting go  Of things  Call back next week
