<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about sports, specifically the underrepresentation of Black athletes in NASCAR and hockey.  The hosts and callers engaged in a conversation rife with racial slurs and stereotypes, speculating on socioeconomic and cultural reasons for this disparity.  This transitioned into a debate on *American Idol*, with the hosts harshly criticizing the judges and contestants, including a particularly scathing commentary on a contestant nicknamed "Peter Brady" and his rendition of "Starry Starry Night." A caller, Dave from Iowa, contributed to the conversation, and studio guest Elo offered opinions on country music.  A humorous segment mocked the absurdity of cricket.  The hosts also discussed a radio personality fired for appearing drunk on-air, and alluded to a potentially controversial story about a former colleague, which they ultimately chose not to share.  The *American Idol* discussion continued throughout the show, interspersed with  further speculation on country music artists.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on Darian O'Toole, a radio DJ whose final, heavily intoxicated broadcast was played in segments.  The hosts, along with Patrice O'Neill (in studio), played clips of O'Toole's erratic on-air behavior, leading to listener calls and detailed commentary on her apparent drunkenness.  The hosts openly discussed her firing,  stating she "never existed," and proceeded to erase all mention of her from the show.  The conversation included details about her personal life, MySpace page, and radio reach.  Rumors about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn were also briefly touched upon.  After O'Toole's dismissal,  the hosts speculated on the cause of her intoxication, playing more clips of her erratic behavior.  They mentioned David Tell's prior appearances and his alleged dislike of Howard Stern, playing audio clips of Pat Cooper criticizing Stern and, indirectly, Opie and Anthony.  Comedian Ralphie May joined the studio, discussing his weight loss surgery and "Celebrity Fit Club" appearances.  The "Short Bus Comedy Tour," featuring comedians with disabilities (Twitchels, Tim Grill, Mike Catello, and Jimmy Graham), was prominently featured.  A betting game was held on how long Twitchels (Tourette's Syndrome) could remain silent (48 seconds).

The show continued with a phone call from Nathan from Arizona detailing a bizarre incident at his radio station involving a coworker consuming tater tots dipped in serosanguineous fluid from Nathan's wound vac, followed by other graphic and offensive stories.  The "Short Bus Comedy Tour" comedians performed short sets, interspersed with offensive jokes and interactions with the hosts.  A discussion about a New York Post article on the Pope's iPod led to further irreverent jokes. Britney Spears' pregnancy and the Church of Scientology were discussed.  Throughout this segment, Ralphie May and Patrice O'Neal remained in the studio.

A later segment focused on rumors surrounding John Travolta, with the hosts imagining a scenario of Travolta confronting someone who discussed him on the show.  Patrice O'Neal promoted his upcoming comedy shows. The show then transitioned to Ron and Fez.  The hosts also discussed Mancow Muller, accusing him of copying their bits, and provided his phone number for listeners to call.  The entire broadcast maintained a highly informal, irreverent, and frequently vulgar and offensive tone.

[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. You damn asshole. Shut your fucking mouth, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up, you damn asshole. Shut up. 
[00:05:30]  I'm Big Dick Black.  You can act like a man. What's the matter with you?  I'm scared of you.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Hello, exactly.  You accused me while I whipped it out.  I'm scared.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I haven't seen it in a while. Maybe that's it. 
[00:06:00]  What happened?  Nymph tree is talking movies.  He's talking movies. Everything from porno to animal bestiality movies and now heat.  Well, let's say hi to everybody. This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  We got lots to do today.  Good morning to everybody.  Dave in Iowa. We'll start the program with a question. Dave, what's up?  Hey, I'm from Iowa. Pretty new, you know, listener to XM and you guys. I love your show. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm about your age, I think.  And I was just wondering, I love what you guys talk about, but I never hear you guys talk about sports.  We need to talk more sports.  Well, you know, I like, you know, I like to hear a little sports now and then.  And I was just wondering what your guys' take was on sports or what your teams are.  Well, I'm a little upset that Canada upset the American team in the World Baseball Classic.  Is anybody watching the World Baseball Classic? 
[00:07:00]  No, no one cares.  And now we got to play like fucking, what, South Africa?  But we could be knocked out even before we play the game?  Like, how is America fucking up baseball?  Because we don't know.  Well, isn't that our sport?  No.  No, it's not.  We've been at it.  But that's not.  But it's all like Dominicans and frigging Japs and everybody else.  No, the Japs aren't as good as the Americans.  Yes, they are.  They get the occasional great Jap.  Because they're little.  See, in Japan, everything is scaled down to Japanese size. 
[00:07:30]  The Japanese with a knife.  And Japanese, when they're their size, they're phenomenal.  Yeah, but they scale everything down in Japan.  So, you know, you see these guys hitting these crazy homers, and you realize, you know, the left field wall is only 100 feet away.  But the ones that are great, though, that kid in Seattle, he's fantastic.  The ones that are great, there's not enough Asians in the major leagues.  They love the game, though. 
[00:08:00]  They love the game.  But the World Baseball Classic, no one gives a shit.  How could, like, Africa have a team?  That is what is getting me.  It's like, we got to play Africa.  Well, motherfuckers can just swing a stick, and they do that goofy cricket shit.  Cricket is the dumbest.  That's true.  I see them playing sometimes in Brooklyn.  They're, like, parks all over Brooklyn, and there they are.  It's the dumbest sport I've ever seen.  Playing cricket.  It's like reverse softball.  You ever seen bitches?  It's like three swings.  It's like, what did he just do? 
[00:08:30]  Is that an oar?  This motherfucker's playing with a...  What the fuck y'all doing?  Like an oar.  Yeah.  And can't you stay at bat for, like, a week or something?  It's the worst.  Like, when do you, like, give up the bat to somebody else?  I don't know.  Don't even call, because I don't give a shit.  When you're happy with your performance.  I don't need that knowledge in my head.  That's why other countries hate us so much.  Every sport that's significant, we invented.  And they want so bad for soccer to be significant, and it won't be.  No, not in this country.  Seven billion people watch the World Cup of Soccer. 
[00:09:00]  It's like, you know what?  Minus 350 million in this country.  And that's what counts, asshole.  Americans don't.  The only people that watch soccer are the people that tie their country's flag to their  Toyota Corolla whenever that soccer...  Why don't you just say Puerto Rican?  Why don't you watch...  Puerto Rican and Brazilians also.  And Dominicans.  Because I've seen that Brazilian flag with a planet on it or something.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  Don't talk about my baby's flag.  No, I understand you.  I'm going to stop spotting your heart.  Don't disrespect my sweetie.  Stop spotting his heart and a hard spot in his pants for Brazil. 
[00:09:30]  That's Patrice.  But they have the best bikinis, those Brazilians.  Oh, with the bikini wax.  You leave my baby's ugly green, yellow, whatever it is.  With stars and...  With stars and...  It's like a planet...  It is like some kind of a flag that Ed Wood would have in a movie that the aliens would  plant on Earth when they got here.  It's an outer space flag.  Leave my babies alone.  Leave them alone.  You know, I'm telling you something.  It's weird that this country really is the only significant country in the world. 
[00:10:00]  It really is.  We don't care about anything else.  We're like...  You go...  Chow Yun-Fat.  Who I love, right?  Uh-huh.  But even before...  But Chow Yun-Fat.  He's the number one Asian...  Is he really?  Yeah.  Is he the number one Asian superstar?  That's great.  Never heard of him, motherfucker.  Who...  When he comes here, he plays a plumber in an extra...  It really starts making movies like Jackie Chan.  Fulani, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He's the biggest Bollywood star ever.  Who?  What is that?  We look at...  Whatever. 
[00:10:30]  We look at the Oscars we're just on, and we look at the best foreign films, and we're  like, who...  Who cares?  I'm sorry, what?  I don't care.  And this guy, you know, put his life into this.  It's his life.  He is Spielberg in his country.  Who wants to watch an Asian movie without karate?  Right.  They're trying to pump up these Asian horrors.  These Asian love stories.  They fucking suck.  Yeah.  Asian horror movies, they're so good, we gotta always remake them.  They gotta be remade here so they can be scary.  From the makers of the Tachi Hakatami's...  The Ring.  The Ring.  Directed by Steven Spielberg, so it's watchable. 
[00:11:00]  Originally called Wootaka Taka.  You have to see The Grudge.  All right?  I'll see you when it's The Grudge.  There's nobody...  I'm telling you, basketball is the best...  We just invented every sport that's interesting, we invented.  There's not one other sport that was invented someplace else that the world...  Curling?  Oh, wow, is that limited.  Hey, Dave, there's your sports talk.  How was it?  I like your sports talk.  How do we do? 
[00:11:30]  Appreciate it.  Hey, what's your favorite sport there, Dave?  I'd have to say college football.  College football.  Good man.  That's an odd thing.  Good man.  Not at all.  College football is a great sport.  College football is so much more exciting than the NFL.  Yes.  Too much shit to keep track of.  When you get a score of 78 to 43, I mean...  College football is a great sport.  Could you give me an estimate on how many college teams there are?  Probably eight.  A couple more than that, Opie. 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  Exactly.  In Division I?  I don't know.  I think there's 100 and something.  Division I?  That's just it.  There's too many goddamn teams to worry about or wonder about.  No one knows the players.  Really?  You do.  No, you do.  You do when they're ready to be drafted.  That's when you know them.  Well, you've known Reggie Bush since he was a fucking...  Reggie Bush.  And if you don't know who the fuck Reggie Bush is, stop talking about college football.  Like, don't even say...  I'm just saying...  Don't have an opinion on college football, Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  If you don't know who the fuck Reggie Bush is...  I don't know who Reggie Bush is.  If you take a peek at college football games, you would at least know enough where it would  be interesting.  I've seen it.  It looks like...  You see it for five seconds as you're going to the freaking history channel.  This motherfucker don't know who Reggie Bush...  And he's like...  You can't have an opinion about anything if you don't say...  Reggie Bush is college football.  I can't...  See, I don't know.  Because I keep no tabs on college football.  At all.  It doesn't...  Well, and sports in general don't interest you, except for like the Yankees.  Yeah, there's a few things.  How can you stay home so much and not be in the sports? 
[00:13:00]  I play Tiger Woods golf on the computer.  What the fuck is...  I watch the PGA every Sunday.  What's wrong, Joe, man?  What the fuck?  I watch the PGA.  It's the most unacceptable sport ever invented is golf.  I'm an Islander fan.  I'm a Knicks fan.  I'll always be a Knicks fan.  See, I...  I'm not going to jump onto another team.  It's a good gauge of how badly or good a team is doing if I know...  Because even I know, and I can't stand basketball, I know the Knicks stink.  Well, they're one of the worst teams in the NBA this year. 
[00:13:30]  It transcends that they stink.  No, I could not know a lot of things about sports.  I know I'm getting older because I know basketball, like when they did the...  I was against the dress code effort.  And then it's like one day I seen like Eddie...  Eddie...  What's the guy's name?  The center that they drafted from...  They got from Chicago.  Oh, uh, Eddie...  I don't know.  Eddie, uh...  Whatever Eddie's name is.  Like I would know.  But him in a suit, I actually was listening to him as if he was a...  Like a regular guy, like a smart guy. 
[00:14:00]  Like a gentleman and a scholar.  Like, it was like, all right, I enjoy listening to this motherfucker in a suit.  Because watching these just tattoos on your neck and...  Uh-huh.  It's just...  It's something about...  I'm getting old, I think.  It's just like that shit was the shit when I was, you know, a kid.  Like, yeah, rebellion.  But I'm like, oh, let's see all this...  Hey, I gotta jump in here because Trucker Stu has a comment.  Trucker Stu.  Trucker Stu.  I had some of that last night for dinner.  What's up, Stu?  Uh, I hate to tell you this, Patrice, but the Americans have not been basketball.  He was a Canadian.  He was down in Boston College teaching, and he's the one who invented it. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, that's fair.  What, uh, uh, stupid...  What's his name?  Dr. Naismith?  Naismith was actually Canadian, but he was in Boston.  But let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  Let's be fair here.  Let's be fair.  I know that's like...  And God bless you for having...  Wait, wait.  Was he really a Canadian, though?  But I don't know, but if...  But I bet you he was just because this guy had a chance to say that.  Yeah.  It was...  It's useless information.  No one knows it.  And he's like, I get to share that.  I know the name.  I know the name. 
[00:15:00]  I know the name.  I know the name.  Canadian Heritage commercials they have.  They talk about great Canadians, and that's one of the ones that...  It sounds like a stupid Canadian game on the outset.  When you think some guy tacking an old apple basket up on a pole...  Yeah.  ...and throwing a melon into it or something.  That sounds like some Canadian fucking game, you know?  We're just having fun, eh?  But to be fair...  You need something to do in the summer, you know, when nothing's iced over for curling.  Eh?  You know?  Let's get a basket, put it on a pole, eh?  And we'll throw like a melon into it or something. 
[00:15:30]  If I get more melons than you, I'm the winner.  All right.  Great.  What did you say about my mama?  Hey, do I have to dunk it on your fucking head, eh?  Yeah, I don't think they were dunking.  There was a lot of layups.  And to be fair to that guy...  Probably didn't even have a backboard at first.  He's from Canada, but we've claimed him.  He's...  Yeah, it's an American sport.  He's an American now.  Yeah.  Invented by an American.  Yeah.  We took that motherfucker.  We took that away from you.  Give me that shit.  All right, Dave.  There's your sports talk.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, what do you think?  Like, all right.  You think, like, Neil Young is Canadian? 
[00:16:00]  No.  We kind of took him.  Guys, we took him from you.  Anybody?  To everybody listening on, that's good.  To everybody listening on XM Canada, Neil Young's not yours.  We're sorry.  We took that motherfucker.  We took Neil Young.  Rush.  And we took Rush from you.  Rush is ours.  We took Rush.  French fries ain't France, this is my more motherfucker.  It's America.  We took it.  Give me that shit.  Good idea.  We won it.  We've colonized.  It's just a matter of time before we blow off the Canadian national anthem at the hockey  games down here.  Yeah, why not?  Okay. 
[00:16:30]  Good dog.  And now they're trying to get, like, soulful black girls to sing it, and it's just as  bad.  Oh, yeah, you hope.  Are they trying that with the same thing they did with the American national anthem?  Trying to get, like, soul it up.  Trying to soul it up.  Trying to rock it up.  Awful.  Keith in Minnesota.  Keith?  Yeah.  You guys are asking how many college football teams are?  I would guess 112.  That's exactly right.  Come on.  You are an asshole.  Come on.  It was written on the phone.  Give it to me.  Give it to me, guys.  No.  Why?  It says Keith from Minnesota, and there are 112 college football teams in the subject line. 
[00:17:00]  I will not accept your answer, cheater.  You're a cheater.  But that's one of the reasons why I got an accent, because they play all the good college  football teams, like Iowa and stuff.  A lot of people are into it.  Of course.  College football is great.  Yeah, 33.  Well, March Madness is about to begin, and I love college basketball as well.  White boys.  Two white boys.  Not even an argument this year on who the greatest player in the game is right now in college. 
[00:17:30]  Two white boys are up for it.  No Negroes are up for it.  How y'all feel about that?  And two American white boys.  I can't say that.  God bless you, fellas.  God bless you.  I hate to tell you, but the whites are taking over basketball again.  No, the Russian white boys.  They're still white.  Eastern blocks.  That's right.  You're taking them.  They're more white.  That's so low.  They are ours now.  That's right.  You're so racist.  You're fucking right.  You're fucking right. 
[00:18:00]  That's right.  We're taking back the NBA, baby.  You're taking foreign white boys.  We're going back to the 50s when it used to be underhand shots and shit.  Now, if you take foreign white boys.  And the hook shot from 30 feet out.  Sports coming back to us, baby.  And the misery was going...  On the real tight shorts.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  You guys had a good run in the NBA.  You have to go against this country if you accept the white boys that are good now in the NBA. 
[00:18:30]  The stars in the NBA who are white, they're not from this country.  So you have to denounce America.  Well, what about the black guys in baseball that aren't from America?  Who?  A lot of those guys are Dominicans.  Guerrero, Vlad Guerrero.  But they're Dominicans.  They don't accept America.  They tell America to kiss their ass.  What's the dude?  You think the Russian basketball players are loving America?  I bet you it's better than fucking Germany, wherever the fuck they're from.  Wherever they come from.  Yeah.  You guys are losing out in the last few years.  And it's only going to get worse. 
[00:19:00]  No.  Get out of here.  There's a lot of boys from the Eastern Bloc coming over to play in the NBA now.  They're very good, but the best players in the NBA are still black.  I will crush you.  LeBron James is ten times better than the next best white boy.  Croatia.  It's the white.  He's going to be playing.  Dirk Nowinski is the best white boy in the league.  Or maybe Steve Nash.  He's from Canada, by the way.  But LeBron is ten times better than Steve Nash, who is arguably the best white boy in the game now.  But LeBron has a little white in him, so.  What?  He's not Michael Jordan black. 
[00:19:30]  What the fuck are you talking about?  What the fuck are you talking about?  There's a little white in that guy.  That motherfucker's agent is Jay-Z.  You can't get more hood.  Jay-Z is his agent.  Man.  Wait, is Jay-Z really his agent?  His management team.  Wow.  He's under Rockefeller management.  That rock.  Nice.  When you see him do the little diamond, like, at the dunks, it says, hey, what's up, Jay-Z?  And Jay-Z owns the Jersey Nets.  Right.  Jay-Z did this. 
[00:20:00]  Jay-Z did this.  Yeah, LeBron's a mogul.  He's a mogul.  But the Eastern Black, the-  And you accept all white boys.  White Trump's black always.  Got it.  They're white.  Just the skin color?  No, I don't.  Just take it.  Just take it.  They're white.  When it comes down to it.  Honestly, in the end, I don't give a shit.  I just like watching a good NBA game.  I love LeBron James, actually.  How could you not?  He's amazing.  How could you not love LeBron?  He's what?  He's still only 18 and a half or something.  I'm so jealous of this motherfucker.  Is he finally 20 years old?  He's 21. 
[00:20:30]  I'm really jealous.  Is he really 21 now?  He's 21, yeah.  He's been in the league almost.  I think this is his fourth year in the league.  No, no, no.  Third.  Third or fourth?  No, not.  He came to the league at the same time.  Even third is ridiculous.  He's his third year in the league.  What were you doing at that age?  And he's average.  They were jerking off.  Working at a sausage stand.  See, a little known fact about me, because we don't talk about him much on the show.  I love basketball.  I love the NBA.  Oh, yeah.  And the thing about LeBron James, they were recruiting this guy.  I knew about LeBron James when he was 15 years old. 
[00:21:00]  They were already talking that he was going to be.  Chatting on the internet.  Meet behind a 7-Eleven.  But, you know, they were already talking that he was going to be an NBA superstar when he  was 14, 15 years old.  Yeah.  He's 6'8".  They had it like, you know...  Dribbles like a guard.  When he was playing high school basketball, they had to take it out of the regular gym  because everyone knew about him back then, and they had to move the high school home  games to arenas.  Really?  Three high school champions.  He's an animal.  Wow.  And it sickens me.  He's worth $200 million. 
[00:21:30]  And he's setting all the records already.  He bugs me.  He bugs me so good.  At 21, I was still a year away from living in my car.  At 21...  I hadn't even attained the lowliness of living in my car yet.  At not one point at 14 did anybody look at me and go, you know something?  You're going to be good at something.  You're going to be the next...  I would have been happy to be the next motherfucker who invented the new Crayola crayon color.  Something.  That motherfucker's going to invent key lime green. 
[00:22:00]  He's going to do it.  It's going to be him.  It's going to be him.  Patrice, he's great.  Did you ever get anything in school where...  You know, you hear people that got into school and their counselors told them, I think you're  best suited for this, or you really could achieve in this, or we've looked at your tests  and you're most likely to succeed in this.  I never got that.  What I got was, you're a funny guy.  And that was it.  That's where it ended.  If they interview Anthony Cumia's teachers, you are doing exactly what they thought you  was.  What they thought I would do.  It's the same thing with me. 
[00:22:30]  Figures.  Yeah.  He's doing that.  Figures.  Making jokes.  Is that what you do?  You make jokes and make fun of people and each other?  That's cute.  That's good.  And when I was a kid, I'm in there like in a...  I remember being in a...  Real noble cause, pussy.  Yeah, noble cause.  You're really changing the world.  When I was in sixth grade, they brought everybody in to the guidance counselor, because I guess  it's sixth grade, you're supposed to reach that point where you kind of have a personality.  You're not quite a child, but you're not a real person yet. 
[00:23:00]  But you're at that point where maybe they can figure out what you want to do and start  you in that direction.  And they brought me in.  But all you want to do at that age was jerk off.  That's pretty much it.  You're not thinking about your future at 12?  No one knows.  Yeah, but LeBron was.  You're jacking 10 times a day at that point.  Oh, he was.  See, he was.  He was thinking about his future.  And there are people like I talked about in the past, like, you know, fighter pilots  that were thinking about it then.  Or the Google guys.  They had their life like set up.  Yeah, they knew.  Like Bill Gates.  He knew.  He was soldering shit together in his garage and making a computer or something with his pals. 
[00:23:30]  You know, I was there.  I'm playing with, like, plastic dinosaurs and, you know, in my room building models or  something like that and had no clue what I wanted to do.  They asked me.  And I sat there like an idiot going, an astronaut?  Just because I figured I had to say something.  What am I going to do?  I went to college.  And they're like, good, good.  You need math.  You'll need math.  And then they start writing things down to what I need.  And I'm like, no, no, I don't want to be an astronaut. 
[00:24:00]  You ruined it for me.  I want to go in space and now I got to do math.  I would never tell a kid to go to college.  College is, it's an excuse to be a bum.  Like I knew when I turned 17, 18 years old, I should be out.  Right.  And I just like went to college.  I can go, mom, look, I'm still going to college and I'm doing this.  It teaches you nothing but how to go out and be unhappy.  It's the dumbest fucking thing in the world.  It's how to be broke.  How to be broke.  How to be unhappy.  And how to hide your sorrow that you're broke and unhappy with alcohol and drugs. 
[00:24:30]  That's it.  I'm not going to argue that.  Let's say how to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up today?  Yo, I want to ask Patrice a question.  Go ahead.  Why does he think black guys never made it in any kind of auto racing?  And so I think from what I understand, I think Bill Burr told me that that is a tremendous white guy's thing is auto racing.  It has its roots in moonshine and driving from the cops and it's a real yeehaw kind of thing. 
[00:25:00]  I don't think there was no place to get into that in the inner city.  There's no place.  Where could we develop that?  And another thing of why my theory is that we got basketball, why we're so good at it, is because it's a very cheap thing to do.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to say that.  You need a ball and the courts are all over the place.  A ball and any hole.  Not just a fucking hoop. 
[00:25:30]  But they used to make motherfuckers stand with their arms out.  Oh, who is that poor bastard that had to do that?  Or a crate.  But that's why, like, hockey, black people are like, oh, niggas' butts is too high and ankles are weak.  They don't like the cold.  It's the fact that they don't like the cold.  They don't like cold.  They have weak ankles and high butts.  And the reason we didn't play is because, first of all, your dad had to get up at 5 in the morning. 
[00:26:00]  And that's if your dad was around.  And I'm not even trying to be funny.  Your dad was going to...  True, yeah, yeah.  No black dad is getting up at 5 in the morning to go rent a hockey rink.  It's a big father-son thing.  It's a very expensive sport.  It's an expensive sport to play.  And it is a father-son thing.  Like, it's usually the father hooking the kid up with all the gear and everything.  We had just a bunch of guys together, and we'd go to the rink at, like, 3 in the morning.  That's when you could play hockey.  I mean, like, as a kid, when you want to start out, if you're going to be a pro, something like that.  Because I think that's what we're talking about.  I don't think it was a father-son sport. 
[00:26:30]  No way, man.  It was in Canada with all the frozen lakes, and you just did what you did with your buddies.  You got a bunch of your buddies together, and you found a piece of ice and said, well, let's screw off for a while.  I understand, like, how that would be, but here in America, in order to – I think if you asked a majority of the professional American hockey players,  it started out – I don't think there were a lot of single moms raising them.  I think it started out with a father that would go to the rink early with his son because you need a rink, build one in his backyard.  I know I've heard a few people have done that in the northern states, something like that. 
[00:27:00]  And I think you brought up a good point there.  Well, that's why the NASCAR question, I just – it's like, thinking about it, you go, where could most – you got to have a car.  Yeah.  And second of all, you got to be – the black guys that do do it, I guess, it might be one.  I think it's one or two, man.  Yeah, there have been a couple of –  And you have to deal with rednecks.  Man, you got to fucking – to this day, probably got to fight, like, some civil rights shit to get a nigga to drive and, you know, 
[00:27:30]  and the motherfuckers trying to drive him and kill him against the wall or whatever.  It's an expensive thing, but that's why we play – we're good at baseball, good at basketball, and good at –  Because it's cheap sports.  It's cheap sports.  Let's go to Chad in Virginia Beach.  Chad.  One, two, man.  Chad, go.  Hey, the reason there's no black guys in NASCAR is you can't put 26-inch spinners on them.  Fucking dick.  You don't even need to finish that asshole.  26-inch spinners.  You have to put spinners on your NASCAR.  You don't want to have rims on your NASCAR.  Oh, fuck off. 
[00:28:00]  Fucking asshole.  Every lap, they get pulled over and harassed by the police.  That's only – the only one we're going to have is license.  Sorry, sir.  It's like, what the fuck can I do now?  His insurance car at the pit stop.  Yes, yes, this is about it.  Sir, you want to step out of the vehicle, please?  I'm strapped in here.  Got a five-point harness.  All right, Leroy, are you ready?  Hey, oh, man, I got to put my hand on the hot hood. 
[00:28:30]  Okay, back away from the vehicle.  Just back away with your hands on your head, please.  Is there a passenger?  No, there's no passenger.  I'm racing here.  It's nothing but a cage.  Then all the white boys are rubber-necking.  Oh, man.  Yeah, oh, look at that.  He must have done something wrong.  The Daytona 500 is over.  The announcer has to announce that the black guy finally completed one lap.  The police pulling them over.  I think I'm – 
[00:29:00]  Look, I'm in the lead.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Pull him over to the side.  Pull him over to the side.  Is there a problem?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're doing 182.  Yeah, but that white boy was just doing 215.  Yeah, but I pulled you over.  There's some racial profiling on it.  No, no.  You were speeding.  Although, Jeff Gordon's like,  I think Leroy got weed in his car.  What?  Sir, I'm smelling marijuana in your vehicle. 
[00:29:30]  Could you step out?  Do you mind if I search the vehicle for drugs?  This is some bullshit.  All right, sir, put your face on the top of the car, please.  What the fuck?  Fucking cars are going around.  You guys being tased on –  Oh, shit.  Oh, see, what the fuck?  Oh, shit.  Niggas in a NASCAR adjusting his rear view mirror. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, what?  Is that me?  Is there a problem, officer?  Damn, I thought I was safe out here.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Let's say hi to Chris in Canada.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  You guys are fucked.  What's up?  Well, see, they can't get the Afro underneath the helmet,  so, you know, it's pretty shitty.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Chris.  But we did make fun of Canada, so I guess, you know,  we got to give it to all.  Go ahead, Joe. 
[00:30:30]  Joe Gibbs has got this thing going on,  Drive for Diversity.  They got at least four African-American drivers,  and they put them in pet crews and everything else.  They're coming into the sport big.  They're paying their way, and it should be a good thing.  They got commercials on NASCAR.com and on NASCAR 166  for who the young black kids' heroes are in NASCAR.  All right.  There you go.  Cool.  So there's only two black racers in history? 
[00:31:00]  McFly, the trucker.  No, there's more than two,  but the two that are the most prevalent were Wendell Scott back in the 1950s  who were admired by a lot of those rednecks that Patrice is talking about.  Richard Pryor.  There's a Richard Pryor movie, right?  Right, exactly.  And also there's Bill Rester in the Craftsman Truck Series.  There was a guy in the 80s.  There was a guy in the 80s that used to race, too.  I think it was NASCAR.  Might have been Indy, though.  It probably was Indy, but that doesn't ring a bell to me.  But anyway, punch it out. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you, buddy.  And NASCAR don't like the Indy guys.  It's a big rivalry there.  See, that's interesting, man.  Like the exposed wheels are bad, and the fenders are good if you're a redneck.  Are you serious?  Yeah, like the NASCAR guys look at Indy race and like,  God damn, where are you going, Billy Bob tonight?  You going to Indy race?  It's like a big joke.  Yeah, fraggot.  They don't like that.  How?  This is a question I have to take back to the black community.  Okay.  We like to know.  All right.  How is one motherfucker better than another at pushing a pedal? 
[00:32:00]  How do you become the best car driver?  Now we're going to have to talk about it for about a half hour to 45 minutes.  I don't, how do you become, how's Jeff Gordon a name when I can push a fucking pedal as good  as Jeff Gordon can?  Do you think you can push a pedal and keep it on the track and pass other motherfuckers  pushing pedals like that?  I do in New York every day, nigga.  Big deal, NASCAR.  You got to know when to hit the pits.  You got to know when to pass. 
[00:32:30]  You got to know all that shit.  Big team effort.  Yep.  You got to know when to draft.  When to, yeah, when to go around him.  It's better to be in second.  But that's technique.  Yeah.  We're talking about how do you get it?  Isn't everything technique and finesse and stuff?  A lot of these guys are also.  Get a good pit crew that know how to make the car run, you know, at high performance.  Yeah.  A lot of the successful guys, too, now are, you know, born into it.  These are guys that are born into, their fathers did it.  You know, their fathers are on the cruise or on, they were drivers themselves, and they 
[00:33:00]  get into it that way.  I think it's pretty hard for just some muck to come up and go.  There's a lot of fucking cheating in NASCAR.  Big time cheating.  Yeah, they banging people a little bit.  A lot of cheating.  A lot of bullshit they ain't supposed to be doing, and they do.  Shut up.  Call foul?  It's like any other sport.  He fouled them.  Everyone's cheating.  Everybody cheats.  Not Barry Bonds.  Look at baseball.  Barry Bonds didn't cheat.  Oh.  Don't even get that started.  Barry Bonds.  Shit.  Barry does not taste it.  Your boy was jealous of Mark McGuire.  Yep.  That's what's coming out now in another book.  That's what they're saying. 
[00:33:30]  Written by who?  Mark McGuire and who else?  Nah, some other guy.  Who wrote that book, by the way?  That nigga was jealous of me.  Written by Mark McGuire.  Here's the story.  Epilogue.  Babe Ruth's son.  Jimmy Roof.  Here's the Barry Bonds story.  The hits just keep on coming from Barry Bonds.  A new book documents the baseball sluggers' alleged steroid use dating back to 1998.  Two San Francisco Chronicle reporters wrote a book called Game of Shadows.  They say their two-year investigation includes court papers, grand jury testimony, and documents 
[00:34:00]  written by federal agents.  Bonds, of course, is one of the baseball's all-time leading home run hitters.  Could become number one this season, and he denies knowingly using steroids.  He refuses to read the book.  The authors, though, stand by their work.  We have very good sources and very good people we've talked to, both providing us information  about Bonds as well as, again, documents from the Balco case.  And we'd like to think it is a definitive accounting of not only what he used, but why he used it 
[00:34:30]  and to the extent that he used it.  And again, Bonds says he won't read the book, saying simply, there's no need to.  There you go.  Yeah, no need to.  He was using steroids.  I lived it.  Why the hell do I have to read it?  He was using steroids just like all the rest of them.  You've got to think most of these freaking guys were using steroids when they were able  to get rid of it.  I actually believe 100% that Barry Bonds is using steroids.  Dude, look how big his head is.  Your head doesn't get that big.  He was a skinny motherfucker.  There's something going on there.  But look at Mark McGuire when he came into the league, that motherfucker. 
[00:35:00]  But why isn't he?  No one is fucking with Mark McGuire about the steroids.  No.  He's not.  No one's on Mark McGuire about that shit.  No one's trying to taint his record.  No one's trying.  He was a big pimply, broided up dude, man.  Of course he was.  And his record has been beat.  So it's not as important.  Yeah, it's not as big a deal.  Wait, who's the Puerto Rican that's getting a fucking...  They're giving him a fistful and he's not even...  Sosa?  Nah, Sosa just retired.  Yeah.  The other dude that they hated. 
[00:35:30]  The dude from Baltimore.  Oh, come on, man.  Oh, shit.  Paul Merrill.  Paul Merrill.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Why was he...  Like, why were they on him hard?  They're not even on Barry as hard.  Barry could break Babe Ruth's record and they're not on Barry as hard as they could be.  They're not...  I don't get who they decide is the fucked up steroid guy and who's not.  You know what I mean?  It's like Mark McGuire, they should be questioning that 70.  Question it. 
[00:36:00]  They should be questioning Sosa 66.  They should really be questioning the fucking thing.  You know what I mean?  Absolutely.  Well, what are you going to do?  What are you going to...  Whoa, what was that?  Greg on Long Island.  Yeah, hi.  Did you step on your cat?  They can't have the blacks in the pits because they take the tires off and they wouldn't put  them back on.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  You know what's fucking hilarious?  God bless these motherfuckers out there.  It's never been a chance.  Nah.  That was not a today joke.  That was a fucking 10 years ago. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  It is like, I get to say this?  I get that.  I'm going to use the joke?  That joke is in our DNA.  That joke is just born.  That joke is the TV on the shoulders running down the street joke.  He gave birth to that joke.  That joke...  Bush!  Oh!  That joke started when we started rolling rocks.  When we realized you could roll a rock because that joke was invented.  Holy shit.  It's like you can fit... 
[00:37:00]  They roll off so wonderfully.  It's like he's been practicing it.  They take the wheels off and won't give them back, baby.  Blah!  All right.  All right.  We're going to break.  We got lots to do.  There's a new video game that they're up in arms over.  Yeah.  And does it have a lot of violence in it?  Well...  No.  Well, just wait till you hear about that.  We got Britney Spears pregnant again, it looks like.  We got a fellow radio personality in a little bit of trouble. 
[00:37:30]  Well, she got fired.  Got fired?  She used to work here in New York City, too.  Darian O'Toole.  Darian got fired?  Dude, we got an audio...  I just was on the fucking show!  No way.  I like that lady!  She's very cool.  She keeps in touch with us and stuff.  She fucking likes you guys.  They fucking get rid of everybody.  And she has cancer, man.  Darian has cancer.  Well, let me tell you.  We got audio of her very drunk on the air.  Very drunk.  And ten minutes after her show, they said goodbye. 
[00:38:00]  Bye-bye, fighter.  So, I don't even think the industry knows about this story yet.  We got a little inside thing on this one.  All right.  So, this is going to pop, I think.  No, Opie was looking for a sound effect.  Not a dumb button.  Patrice, don't worry about it.  Oh, no.  I didn't have the right template.  Oh, I thought he was still going to dump it out because I said some fucking information.  No, no, no.  We've dumped once just because it was personal information.  Somebody said a name.  That was the only time we've dumped so far is Bill.  Bill accused one of his professors of drug abuse or something. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  Some kid touching.  It was some allegation that, like, Fred Jackson.  Yeah, and he uses his name, the school he was at.  It was, like, this big thing, and that was the only time we had a dump.  And I don't even know if the dump worked.  Bill's coming in to tell us what it was.  We don't want to know what it was.  Get out of here.  Bill, without using his name, what was it?  No, don't even say it.  I swear to God, don't even say it.  Just...  No!  Will you get him the fuck out of here? 
[00:39:00]  Pull him out of here.  Pull him out of here.  Bill, do you like working here?  Because if that goes on the air, not only are we fired, this place becomes a fucking  Home Depot.  Don't take some time.  Poe bodily removed him.  Bill doesn't understand.  Wow.  Bill doesn't understand.  Bill doesn't understand.  The allegation he had was so ridiculous that we'd all be fired, and they would pretty  much make this into, like, a Target or a Home Depot.  You ever read the Stephen King book, The Stand? 
[00:39:30]  I hate Stephen King shit.  Yeah?  You ever read it?  Well, no, I just did.  I watched it on...  I watched...  You watched the lousy movies they make of it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bill is like Trash Can Man, who, like...  He's so crazy that even the devil himself knows he needs him, but even he is a little  frightened of him and a little off and a little like, I need this guy, but he is fucking  out there.  And that's what Bill is.  He's like Trash Can Man. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus, man.  All right.  It is frightening.  He is a frightening entity to have around.  I can't believe she fucking got fired, man.  Yeah, well, we'll get into the audio.  I like that lady.  We'll try to do the audio next.  We also got to talk about American Idol because some interesting observations there.  Oh, well, the guys were up last night.  The guy's a lot more entertaining this year than the girls.  Yep.  And again, another stellar night.  That ball-headed rocker, man.  Yeah, he's really good.  Had a bit of an off night last night, but still kicked everybody's ass.  And I'm getting so tired of fucking Simon's...  His honesty is dishonest. 
[00:40:30]  Do you think?  Oh, my God.  We got to...  I think he's the only one that's being honest.  We got to argue this point.  Did you watch the show?  He's a dishonest, honest guy.  He's a fucking disingenuine...  Hold on.  Do you watch the show every night?  I watch it every other night.  I miss it sometimes.  This is the first...  We've said this a few times.  This is the first year I'm into American Idol, and I'll go all the way to the end.  I usually watch a couple weeks here and there.  I was into it last year.  Okay.  I always bought the hype that he was just a complete ass for no real reason.  For the sake of being the ass guy.  Right.  But the more and more I watch, I'm like, he's the only honest guy there. 
[00:41:00]  The other ones are too scared to say what they're really thinking.  Paul Abdul has said maybe two negative things in a month.  Yeah, everyone's great.  You know what?  That does not...  And Ryan Seacrest, his whole job is to challenge Simon, and that is what's real phony.  But that...  But you can tell that that is completely the producers saying, give it to Simon.  Yeah, look.  That seems to be working.  But...  Simon hasn't been wrong yet.  He had...  See, here's the thing.  This motherfucker does not...  This is the problem I have with him. 
[00:41:30]  He's not cultivating talent.  He's cultivating who is going...  This whole American thing.  The other two cultivate talent.  Oh, my God.  Listen, last night, man, that kid, the bald-headed rocker kid, was excellent.  He was all right.  I was even...  He was excellent.  He has it.  He has a real...  Some of them you go, he can sing, but when are we going to watch this motherfucker?  No star quality.  This guy, you can see him on stage performing.  Yep.  Okay? 
[00:42:00]  Simon, instead of...  He could go, hey, man, you know what?  This motherfucker's good.  You are good.  But...  I find it kind of boy.  It wasn't his best performance.  Patrice.  I think so, too, and I think he was being honest there.  Simon gives props to maybe two a night.  That's it.  Maybe three.  Yeah.  But he can give props to the ones that he should give props to.  I'll tell you why.  No.  Because all those people, Paula, Randy, and Simon, they already know that it's going  to be down to the four guys.  They know who it's going to be already.  And the rest of these guys would just fill her. 
[00:42:30]  Yep.  The little country bitch with the Jesus drives.  The what?  The Jesus take the wheel.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Carrie Underwood.  Carrie Underwood.  She stinks.  So she did a special appearance, right?  Yeah.  And it's like, he'll go, watch her.  She's a girl.  She's the idol.  Now she's good.  If she...  Her performance was as bad or as good as these bitches that's on now.  Dude.  But she's better.  She fucking sucks.  Dude, she was singing her hit.  Jesus take the wheel. 
[00:43:00]  That's the number one country song.  Remember when we fucked around with her?  That don't count.  And it's been the number one country song for like 10 weeks.  That's like being the fucking number one orchestra hit.  No one gives a shit.  She's awful.  And any country music fan who's a real country music fan will never say she's good.  The people who bought her thing are fly-by-night motherfuckers.  Real country people will never enjoy Jesus Take the Wheel by that American Idol phony.  And now she's a great performer? 
[00:43:30]  But dude, the reason it's number one...  He doesn't say she needs...  Hold on.  The reason it's number one in the country is because people are buying it, that shit.  You know what?  They're buying that...  That doesn't count all the time.  I understand.  But it's the number one song as far as country music goes.  Yeah, someone's buying it.  That's where your argument is done.  I don't personally get it.  I think the song stinks.  And you think they're going to bash her?  You know what our contract is?  Probably so much money goes to American Idol's producers.  Yeah, they all...  And then the money that the judges are paid with comes out of the production money. 
[00:44:00]  So it would be like money out of their pocket if they bash her.  That's their cash cow right up there.  They were looking at money.  I think less the dog, homie, less that, Randy's the best judge on there.  I don't know.  I think he's too...  Lest the fucking the dog go home to...  Yeah, but he's too nice.  He's too nice.  Because even when he knows that there was a really bad performance in front of him, he's  always like...  You know...  He does that a lot. 
[00:44:30]  He does say, you suck, and you suck.  A lot of times, he barely can say it.  He's like, I just wasn't feeling that.  But, you know...  You know...  You were a little pitchy in the middle.  Which is his version of saying, you were horrendous.  You were patrocious.  You were terrible.  That's his way of saying it.  A lot of times, they're on the same wavelength there, but they just have a different way of  saying it.  Oh, my God.  Simon bugs me, and it's not real honesty.  By the way, Carrie Underwood, Tom from Buffalo has some info. 
[00:45:00]  Tom, go ahead.  Yeah.  Yesterday on the CBS Morning Show, they had the announcement for the Academy of Country  Music Awards.  Carrie Underwood is up for four of them.  So she can't suck all that bad.  She's like a superstar in the genre.  What an award.  Jesus.  Her peers are the ones who nominated her for it.  Really?  A little known fact, our big boss, Elo, is a huge country fan.  Elo.  Patrice.  I love you, but you're dead wrong.  So you're a super country fan, so she's legitimately good. 
[00:45:30]  She's from Oklahoma.  She's legitimately good.  She's the real deal.  Elo.  I'm telling you.  Big country fan.  Country music fan.  I mean, I'm saying, all right, Elo, you like that song?  I do like this song, actually.  Jesus Take the Wheel?  I do like this song.  Jesus Take the Wheel!  Hey, Elo, how about Jesus Take the Scissors?  Dude, look, that's all I wanted.  I'm not a real country music fan.  I was making a throwing it out there statement that real country music fans. 
[00:46:00]  Elo, first of all, you run a big corporation.  Fuck, you're not a country music fan.  I want some dirty motherfucker from Schittsville to tell me that Carrie Underwood is good.  Hold on a second.  I'll call my father, okay?  He was one of the biggest country programmers in America before.  Who, Elo?  Yeah, before you...  So she's just legit.  All right, well, fair enough.  Fair enough, man.  Fair enough.  Actually...  For five years, I was on the board of directors for the CMA. 
[00:46:30]  Actually, really?  Look, look, okay...  Jesus, this guy is a...  He's an expert.  I thought the achy...  Now, was the achy-braky-heart guy good?  Billy Ray Cycris?  It's Cyrus, but he's horrible.  No, he's terrible.  That was a one-day wonder.  To me...  That was just a bad line dance.  I got a record on it.  So she is far beyond him.  Elo?  All right, fair enough.  And again, we don't want to turn this into Casey Kasem, but...  Elo, why don't you tell everyone who your friend in country music is? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, well, let's see.  Actually, one of my closest friends is Keith Urban.  Keith Urban.  Yep.  One of the biggest stars out there.  Isn't that weird, a country star with the last name Urban?  Keith Urban.  That's odd.  Huh?  He was dropped by his little band called The Ranch, and I actually played it and made  it a hit in Seattle, got him in and really got the president to extend his record deal,  and now he has a solo career.  He owes you, man.  Well, he was really funny.  I see him all the time.  He calls just out of the blue, and we talked last time about three months ago for about an  hour.  One last question for me about this. 
[00:47:30]  I'm going to take this.  He named all his credits and his legitimacy.  That is legit.  In my ears, in my humble Negro ears, I thought she was horse shit.  So I'm wrong.  Now, just Cowboy Troy, is this some legitimate shit going on?  I can't tell you that Cowboy Troy is legitimate, but he's certainly fun to watch.  All right.  Who the hell is Cowboy Troy?  That means he's leaving it open just to see it.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  I mean, Cowboy Troy, any time that your song is called I Play Chicken with a Truck Truck, 
[00:48:00]  which is his song, it's a little bit of a thing.  It sounds a little gimmicky.  But Elo's not going to be until Troy's career is officially over, then he's like, ah, he's  stunk.  And then I want to say he got ran over by the same truck truck.  He might be scheduled to come in and perform live at the XM facility.  So I re-sit, I re-nig all my fucking thing with her.  No, you don't need to re-nig all my fucking thing with her.  Fair enough.  I hate her song.  I just thought, I just seemed like she was just some canned shit.  There's a lot of people who don't like her, but I just wanted to tell you that she, in  the eyes of many country fans, she actually is legit. 
[00:48:30]  And Elo, you'd bang her, right?  Well, I mean, she's certainly attractive.  Ah, yes.  I don't know if bang would be the word.  She's a little thing.  She was right outside the studios.  There you go.  Got a little thing, a little teeny thing.  And I'm very sad about Darian O'Toole, by the way.  Yeah, we got great audio of her today, though.  You know Darian?  You know what?  We had mutual friends when I was in San Francisco, because she left San Francisco to go to New  York.  Right.  Well, wait till you hear what we have.  Oh, I can't wait.  All right, Elo.  All right, Hillbillies rule. 
[00:49:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Hillbillies rule.  That's Elo.  Elo's a redneck.  I didn't realize that.  No, he loves the country music.  I would imagine he was born inside of the Empire State Building.  That is really funny.  Corporate motherfucker.  Oh, sweet 22A.  All right.  I was born up there, I remember.  My mother didn't utter a word or a scream or anything.  I just came out in complete silence.  Came, popped right out on the desk.  Right out.  He was born in a corporate pod. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  On a desk blotter.  Right.  That's amazing.  Elo's a fucking goddamn redneck.  We might have to look at the top country songs in America today, like we did that one  time.  Oh, yeah.  There's songs like Living in Fast Forward, Your Man, What Hurts the Most, Tonight I Want  to Cry.  All right.  And I Get Where I'm Going.  Tell what that's about.  She Don't Tell Me To.  Jesus, Take the Wheel.  Bon Jovi Duet with Jennifer Nettles.  Nice little crossover there. 
[00:50:00]  Who Says You Can't Go Home, Nobody But Me, and Get Drunk and Be Somebody.  There you go.  We're going to have to try to figure out what some of those songs are today.  Get drunk and be somebody.  So here's Ryan Seacrest.  A honky tonk, but donk it donk.  Is that still on there or did that get kicked off the list?  It's off the top ten.  Oh, god damn.  What happened to a honky tonk, but a honky donk, donk, donk, donk, donk, donk? 
[00:50:30]  Awfulness.  So Ryan Seacrest and good old Simon Cowell.  Yeah.  Because like I think Patrice or someone said, Ryan Seacrest, the producers have basically  said, you know, challenge Simon.  Challenge him.  You two go at it.  The people seem to enjoy it.  It's so fucking fake.  It's not even funny.  But here's what happened last night.  I think you've got the granny vote again tonight with that song.  What?  The granny vote?  I do?  I'll take the granny vote.  No, no, no.  I think they'll love you for that.  Take any vote I can get.  I'm granny.  You know, but it was very juvenile. 
[00:51:00]  How old are you?  How old are you, Kevin?  I'm 16 years old.  He's 16 years old.  No, no, no.  But two of these girls are 16, 17.  That was more like 11.  No.  Oh, whatever.  I'm not being rude.  Not at all.  Don't worry about it.  I love how he finishes things like that with, I'm not being rude.  No, it's all good with me.  Joe, I had a dream about you last night.  I don't want to know.  That doesn't surprise me.  I don't. 
[00:51:30]  I had a dream that you gave constructive criticism.  Could you attempt just a little bit for Kev?  Because I think he wants to be in that top 12.  I haven't had that dream yet.  Look, Ryan.  You've had more of a nightmare.  I don't want to discuss whatever fantasy dreams you have about me on this show.  I mean, that's like off camera.  See, like Ryan's trying to be the tough guy and stick up for the kids.  But why is Simon not as fucking phony as him? 
[00:52:00]  I just don't see it that way.  Fair enough, man.  That motherfucker.  And as far as constructive criticism, Ryan Seacrest coming up with that dumb line, these  kids are singing in front of 30 million people.  Yeah, you're past the point.  You're past the point of constructive criticism.  But he has the power.  People is.  Wait a minute.  The people are so fucking dumb, right?  He gets people thrown off who he wants thrown off.  That's what his job is.  Because he is manipulating the fucking TV audience. 
[00:52:30]  He goes, you know, little guy with the diabetes.  I think tonight, America, you are gone.  Get rid of him, America.  Fair enough.  He's steering people.  I say get rid of him.  Of course.  But so far, every person that I thought should be voted off has been voted off.  You know, I can't lie that fucking the bitch that's saying.  So far, it's gone perfectly.  Donna Summon.  Yeah, Donna Summon.  The last dance girl.  Yeah.  Should have gone.  But I don't think the little half Malaysian, half Fiji Island motherfucker should have left. 
[00:53:00]  Sway?  He shouldn't have left.  I didn't like him at all.  The little no-shoulders guy, he stinks.  Oh, the little Peter Brady?  Yeah, the little bug kid.  Peter Brady's got to go this week.  I say he's gone.  They're like, oh, yes, I like you.  You know, there's something about you.  I like you so much.  Sway should have lasted another week.  You're probably right on that.  Sway should have lasted, man.  But he wasn't going to win the whole thing anyway, so it doesn't matter.  He wanted him gone.  So, constructive criticism, he's talking about Kevin, the little chicken little kid. 
[00:53:30]  The little chicken little with the lisp.  You give constructive criticism to this performance.  Ready for this?  This was beyond horrendous.  This kid is so gone.  This is the little no-shoulders.  The little, he has the tiniest little, like, chicken little.  Just a little sickly kid.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  He's from Levittown on Long Island, but the kid's done.  He's so gone.  Remember the kid, the little chicken that used to be dropped off for Foghorn and Leghorn to take care of?  Hey, bar.  Hey, bar, we're going to teach you how to play baseball.  Baseball, that is. 
[00:54:00]  And the kid would walk around with the glasses, and he wouldn't know how to do anything.  Didn't talk.  And, like, he'd come back.  Foghorn with Leghorn would come back.  I got the ball and the glove, son.  Where are you?  And he'd be building something.  Like, a big science project.  Boy's about as sharp as a sack of wet and mice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, here's his performance.  That's what he looks like.  Exactly.  Ryan Seacrest wants Simon Cowell to give this performance constructive criticism.  Here it is.  Starry, starry night 
[00:54:30]  Paint your palette blue and gray  Look out on a summer's day  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  Darkness in my soul  Now I think I know  Na, na, na, na, na  Na, na, na, na  What you tried to say to me 
[00:55:00]  Goodbye  How you suffered for your sanity  God  How you tried to set them free  They would not listen  They did not know how  Holy shit!  Perhaps they'll listen now  I gotta apologize for Simon too  Goodbye  I could not love you  Goodbye  But still your love was true  And when all hope was left inside 
[00:55:30]  On that starry, starry night  You took your life as lovers often do  But I could have told you  This shit  This world was never meant for  One as beautiful  As you  Like he's hitting the notes and all  Which he doesn't always do  Starry, starry night  But the lisp  The song itself  His presentation of it  Just stinks 
[00:56:00]  Where's the constructive criticism?  Why did Ryan have to say it after this kid?  This kid is so done  Someone has to tell the kid  He has a really bad lisp  And he shouldn't pick a song  That has a lot of S words in it  Starry, starry night  He picks the worst song  As far as his lisp goes  Eat your pallet  Blue and crack  It sounded like his chest cavity  Was giving out on a man  Baby talk, baby talk  It's a wonder you can walk  Buddy Hinton's making fun of me  Yeah, Vos should have sung that song 
[00:56:30]  Very good  That was  Dude, he picks a song  Atrocious  He picks a song that has a lot of  ST words in it  And that's his lisp problem  But what did  So, wait a minute  That audio that played before  Was his comment on this song  Yeah, I fucked it up  That wasn't even  As bad as it should have been  No  That's what I'm saying  Because that was kind of  A better performance  That he's done  He's been worse than that  But what has  What did Paul and what's called  Say to him?  Paul loves him  Yeah, Paul loves him  You're so adorable 
[00:57:00]  The people love you  You have such a  He won't go  Style  I don't think he's gonna go this week  Let's do some bang on this  I don't think he's gonna go this week  No, he was third last week  I don't think he'll go this week  He's so  How much money?  $20?  There's no one else  There's no one else  There's no one else  There's no one else  There's no one else  There's no one else  $20 and I'll tell you  Who they're voting off  Who?  They're voting off  Fucking Peter Brady's going  And country dude?  And uh  With the twin brother?  And no, he's gonna be in  Then did he run out of people?  No  Because it's between those three  There is one more guy  Wait a minute  Shit  Who?  That little kid ain't going, man 
[00:57:30]  I don't think he's going  Oh, he's so done  That kid is not going  $20 a man  $20, I'm in  I'll take your $20  And I'll take your $20  He is absolutely not going  Alright, he's not going  $20  Absolutely not going  Who's going?  I don't know, but it ain't him  Get the page up  I think we're gonna get an upset  Yeah, who's left?  Holy shit  I think we'll have an upset  Dude, I don't even want to  Take your money  This is too easy  He was in the Acquirer's week  With the story of how his girlfriend  Is a better singer than him  And he has diabetes  He's fucking not going  Dude, he is  Because this country  You gotta understand  Listen 
[00:58:00]  Oh  Uh  We'll find out tomorrow  What's his fucking name?  Simon Cow  Or Simon  Whatever  Simon Cow  He doesn't give a shit  About your talent  Neither does America  That's the whole setup  For this thing  It's not about  That's why no big fat black girls  Have won yet  Because they're the best singers  Other motherfuckers have won  I can relate to Simon a lot  Believe it or not  People are shocked by that  I'm sure  He's not  Simon didn't beat that kid up  Because he knew he was so gone  It was just like  I'll just let the guy 
[00:58:30]  Have his last moment on the stage  I'm telling you  Now if you're saying  He's so honest  Why wouldn't he say  Kid  You and your dumbness  Go back to Long Island  He didn't say he was good  He just  He trashed her  But he didn't  Go over the top  And kill him  And go look dude  You're so gone  He just knows  I'll leave it there  Overnight  Alright  This is the easiest  I should take more than 20  From you actually  No I'm going to take 20  From you  And I'm taking 20  From him  What is left  Let me say  And if I lose  I'll give you 20  And I'll give you 20  I'm telling you  America  And study in the list 
[00:59:00]  Alright  You get fat boy  Next to the sissy  Okay you see where  That arrow is there  Gideon can go  No  Gideon can go  Gideon can go  He's not going  Because they like Gideon  But the fat kid  Next to Gideon  What fat kid  The funny looking kid  Next to Gideon  That one there  Damn  That's Sway  He's gone already  There's another one  There's another  Dude I'm telling you  There's no  Will is gone  The Peter Brady  Looking kid  He's gone  And then  I think America  Will throw out 
[00:59:30]  Gideon before they  Throw out Kevin  Holy shit  And fake  America  No  He's a black  Gay guy  No  Who in America  Who votes on this  Fucking show  No  Gideon  Gideon has some  Crazy talent  He's very good  You know something  There was a black guy  Named  What was his name  George  A couple of seasons back  It was a black gay guy  Who was really good  And they threw his ass out  Before they threw out  Other people  They didn't vote for Clay  Because he was gay  And Clay's white  This is the easiest bet 
[01:00:00]  Dude this is the first time  You've watched it down to this level  I've seen the upsets  This is the easiest  This is the easiest bet  I've had in a long time  I think Gideon goes  This is just no one else left  Will and Gideon  And you guys got a lot of faith  In fucking  Core shit  Joe Cocker  I don't  The people adore him  I don't have faith  In Joe Cocker  The people love him  Wait Matt of Long Island  Doesn't either  Matt  Yeah you're wrong man  That Joe Cocker dickhead  Is out of here  Thank you dude  I have no faith 
[01:00:30]  In Joe Cocker  Do you see the ovation  He gets when he's done  He's horsey  Cause this country  I know  But that's who's voting  Don't we  That's who's voting  This is Anthony's sport  It's not you voting  You me  It's the American people  Are voting on this  It's not professional  It's not Simon  It's not  It's the fucking rubes  Let's play Taylor Hicks  Right now  And you can sit there  At home  Or in your car  And say that  This performance  Is worse than 
[01:01:00]  Starry  Can you do it  Starry starry night  This  Taylor Hicks  Make your palates  Blue and  Suffering  Succotash  Taylor Hicks  Doesn't even have  A  C  D  E  F  G  Dude  Taylor Hicks  Is not  H  I  J  K  Here it is  You don't know  Me  Little Michael  McDonald  See Patrice's  Hay Day  Because it's  White boy music  Relax Patrice  You don't like

[01:05:00]  No one's beating this guy  No one  Yeah but I said that  About Bo Bice  And look what happened  Yeah but they're ready  They're ready to  Vote in a rocker  America doesn't vote  By the way  He's seven weeks  From leaving that awful wife  And those kids  That ain't his  And that friggin job  At the auto parts store  Or wherever he works  She's in a gym  Every day  Right now  She's like  Fuck  She's chasing him  On a treadmill  And she wears a shirt  Called Groupies Suck 
[01:05:30]  She's doing sit ups  And crunches  She bought a Bowflex  Oh  She's got around  The clock trainers  She's not even  Sleeping anymore  It's over Johnny  Called the nip tuck guy  She knows  The kids haven't eaten  In two weeks  Cause he's too busy  Running around the neighborhood  That guy is so gone  Oh that fucking horse  She is out of here  She's gonna be touring  Get your shit together bitch  There's gonna be 20 chicks a night  It's not even his kid  So  No  It's not like he's got  Any real attachment  He has an easy  He has it  You watch him on stage 
[01:06:00]  It's like  He's like a professional  The rock star  A lot of these people  Can sing  But they're not  The only two professionals  There's three  There's  Man this is a professional  Yeah  But she's more like  A backup singer  She reminds me of  A really good  Aretha Franklin's  Backup singer  She had the best performance  Two nights ago though  But Paris  Paris is a professional  She's letting me down man  I thought Paris was gonna  Win the whole thing  She's starting to fall off  A little bit  It's all in the youth  That can't pull it together  Like you give her 
[01:06:30]  A couple more years  She's probably gonna be  Like a seasoned professional  At like 18  One song  A week  As we like to call her  Is blowing Paris  Out of the water  You can't sing  Like if I ask you  To sing one  One song  Fucking song  Two minutes  Next week  Hey Anthony  Sing the song next week  You can't give me  All you got  Everything  Once  Right  Dude they're picking  Their own songs though  That's the problem  That's why Kevin is out  If he didn't pick  Starry Starry Night  He might have  I don't know  He's got  He's playing to his demographic

Hey  Hey uh  I don't have XM in my new truck yet  So I've been forced to listen to  A man cow these last few months  I was listening before I called you  He's got a guy in the studio  That's gonna put his junk in a mousetrap  Oh wow  How about that?  I'm so glad we can help  All the radio shows across America  This guy is fucking ridiculous 
[01:14:00]  Like two days after you guys do something  He's on it  Absolutely  And then he'll go on TV  And on his own show  And trash us  But he's getting a lot of show prep  From our fine program  Glad we can help you out  Over there  I love these fucking guys  Cause there's another show  KOMP in Vegas  Guy's gonna be stung in the ball bags  For NASCAR tickets or something  Yeah  With bees  It's like why don't you at least wait  Six to eight months  So it's not so obvious  Let a little time go by  If I can order an attack  I would 
[01:14:30]  It's 8882-MANCOW  Boys  Dude  ManCow is just a desperate  Desperate radio guy  You know  Howard Stern quits regular radio  ManCow  Wasn't good enough for satellite radio  No one wanted him on satellite radio  So then he's like  Well at least I'll get Howard stations  When Howard goes to satellite  Eh  Sorry  And then he's bragging  He didn't get one  He didn't get one of Howard's markets  He was bragging about how he got good ratings  In I swear to you  I never heard of some town in Montana  That I never heard of in my life 
[01:15:00]  He's sending out his own press releases  Yeah his own press releases  Of how he's doing great  In these very very small little towns across America  Sendicated to a lot of markets around the country  And they're all these little one horse towns  The guy can't make it  He's made it in one big city  You know  He's a name  He's a name in a big city  And that's it  So Howard left  And there were all these great great stations  That needed an air personality  They didn't even look at ManCow  No  And here in New York  David Lee Roth  There's stories in the paper again today 
[01:15:30]  That he's just failing miserably  And getting into fights with management over there  And you know  The writing's on the wall over there  That's pretty obvious  And they're not going to be calling ManCow  When they get rid of David Lee Roth  Nope  Sorry  Huh?  You guys mind if I give that number out again to the pest?  Yeah go ahead  I would love to hear his excuse  Why he's doing the mousetrap bit  Right  I did that back in 1989  I was there  I did the mousetrap thing  Shut up you ass  Shut up 
[01:16:00]  You did not  It's 888-2-MANCOW  888-2-MANCOW  Fucking call this prick  I'm sure he's got screeners up the ass over there  They're just going to  Of course  Try to  Of course  Not confront the situation  Yeah just ask him where he got the idea from  I got it from my own brain  My own head  I'm a genius  I'd imagine  You know  If we're going to be fair here  There's probably someone that did mousetraps on the air  Before we did it recently  But that's the weird thing  It's such a recent thing that we did  And all of a sudden guys all over the country are doing it 
[01:16:30]  It's like  Why don't you wait a while?  I'd like to hear from a radio personality  That had done that before us  I really don't know  Who the fuck is going to have the balls  To go up and say  Hey boss  We want our listener to come in  And snap his nuts in a mousetrap  Right  And then the boss that's going to say yes  Aaron in Jersey  Hey guys  How you doing?  Hey  Hi  I just want to let you know  When David Lee was off the air for a little while  PSP in Pennsylvania  PSP? 
[01:17:00]  PSP I think it is  What were they?  PST?  Or YSP  Oh YSP  Oh YSP  W  David Lee was off  They had a temporary guy  Who's usually in the afternoons  And just from listening for about five minutes  I heard a bunch of things that were familiar  Like they had someone call in  And say the DJ's name  And hang up on him before he gets to respond  That old gag  Wait what's that gag? 
[01:17:30]  Like oh Opie  Yeah  Click  Click  Yes  That and everyone laughing  They did the fourth local bit  Where they have a little jingle about a fourth local bit  And then they talk about  You know this Google Expressway  I got a report last night  Off of MySpace  That I guess Kid Chris  Was getting a website together  Where he's asking for people  It's under a different name  Not a pest or something  But it's similar  And he's looking to recruit people 
[01:18:00]  To do like missions  And attack other shows  And stuff  With  Yeah  Anyway let's move on to another DJ  That we kind of like  She was in New York radio for a while  Patrice O'Neill likes her  Darian O'Toole  She was huge in San Francisco  And then she came to New York  And failed miserably  And then she went to a couple different places  And then went back to San Francisco  Right?  Yeah  And she was off to a great start there  And she got fired yesterday  Darian O'Toole fired 
[01:18:30]  Fire  She came in like a lion in January  And Darian O'Toole crept out like a lamb in March  K-I-F-R  That stands for  Free FM  Oh it does?  It's another Free FM station  Alright  The format that Infinity Radio launched  After losing Howard Stern  Hoping to take away the sting of losing  The self-proclaimed king of all media  Erased all references to O'Toole on its website  And program director Ken Cole  Came close to disavowing all knowledge 
[01:19:00]  Of anything and everything  That's how radio works people  Jesus Christ  You're on the air one day  You're a star  You're the guy  And then the next day  When you get fired  You never existed  It's like  The only surviving  Stalin philosophy  I was going to say  It's like Russian history  Is in radio  Where all records are to be wiped out  The alphabet doesn't  You guys  The new alphabet was  B-C-D-E  No  L-M-N-O  L-M-N-P 
[01:19:30]  You can't even do it  Without getting the O out  No O  No A  No O and A  Please  When writing memos  Into corporate memos  Do not use the letters O or A  Especially next to each other  There was talk  Of a disheveled show  Two Fridays ago  And then O'Toole  Was reportedly out sick  For a week  It's not good news  For the Canadian  Who claims San Francisco  As her home  She's been fired  From some big gigs  In New York and San Francisco  Before  But the station  Seemed a natural fit  It's hot talk 
[01:20:00]  With young hosts  And it should have worked for her  Although on  One of her midday shows  I heard probably  The worst hour of talk radio  This side of the  Sewage nation  When her bathroom habits  Were the sole topic  Of conversation  Free FM  Had hit a major bump  That day  Almost as Rocky  Is here in the morning  Doghouse on the same station  Claim that Clear Channel Radio  Made up the incident  That got them fired  A lot of local shit  That I don't know anything about  If you heard the show  Last Friday  That got her bumped  Or have insider news  Drop a comment  I'm only hearing  Ugly rumors so far  But we'll try to add more soon 
[01:20:30]  P.S.  Tori Ryder  Who worked at KPIXFM  And KFRC  Is filling in for now  And PPSS  If being fired is a curse  In radio  Just remember  Howard Stern  And Rush Limbaugh  Both of whom  Lost plenty of jobs  On the way to the top  And one more  Word is her last show  Is a classic  Does anyone have a tape  I requested it  From Ken Cole  Who claims the station  No longer keeps  Log tapes  Yeah right  If one of you has it  Please get it to me  And I can put part of it  Up here 
[01:21:00]  Well  Well Brad Cava  We have the tape  Well  Who has the tape  Of Darian O'Toole  Allegedly sloshed  This is her last show  On the air  When we have the tape  That they're looking for  Out there in San Francisco  I heard some of this  In the office this morning  Steve was playing it  We were getting a good  Little chuckle  And I don't know  Any of the circumstances  But she does indeed  Sound like people  I have heard 
[01:21:30]  That have been drunk  A lot of slurring  A lot of blank  Open spaces  A lot of being out  Of the conversation  Completely  Babble  Things like that  Right  That would lead me  To believe  Perhaps she was  Intoxicated  Alright really fast  We just gotta rewind  A second here  Cliff in Boston  Cliff  Good morning  B-b-b-b-boys  Hey Cliff  Make it fast  Because we're on a roll  Right now  Sure  I just got through  To Mankow  I talked to the screener  Yeah 
[01:22:00]  The screener's actually  Really cool  I told him  That the bit  Was originally  An ONA bit  And I asked him  Where they got the idea  He said that  Somebody suggested  They throw about  A thousand of them  On the floor  And have somebody  Walk around  Or crawl around  Uh huh  And I was like  You do realize  ONA did that  Like a month ago  Right  And he was like  Well  I asked if they were  Going to give credit  He goes yeah  I don't see Mankow  Doing that  He's like you guys  Have been calling  Like for the past  Ten minutes  But I don't think  He's gonna do it  Yeah  I don't either  Those guys  No one's listening 
[01:22:30]  To them anyway  On satellite radio  Everybody knows  They don't have  Any listeners  And I'm here  I have listeners  On a bad day  I have one million  Times the listeners  That they  Oh just that  Rambling radio  Voice delivery shit  Have fun over there  Have fun  So glad we could  Help out every  No one wants you  No one wants you  No one wants you  But we help out  A lot of radio shows  Yeah  We're show prep  Yeah we got show prep  They just go to our website  And they get all their ideas  There you go  They've been doing it for years  Happy to help 
[01:23:00]  Hoo hoo  Tell them Fred  But it's the truth  Uh what's Ben doing  Uh shaking  Ben  Um sweating  Funny looking at their uh  At their website  The station she was on  In San Francisco  It just says  Free FM programming now  At 10am  Like her picture's gone  And everything  Yeah that's what they do  They wipe you out  But why are they  This is what I don't get  About radio  They don't know how  To have fun anymore  If you got a jock  That is drunk on the air  I'm listening every day  Yeah  Every day 
[01:23:30]  You want to get ratings  You allow her to continue  To go on the air drunk  Let her drink  I don't care if she babbles  About grass growing  If she's drunk  If she's drunk  Me and Ben were joking  Like who can't drink  On the air  Jesus Christ  Who can't get drunk  On the air  And perform  And do a god damn show  Only amateurs  Amateurs can't do it  Me and Ben  Let me tell you  A little story  About WNEW days  We were hammered  By noon  And we didn't have  To be on till 3  Dude we should have 
[01:24:00]  An experiment man  I'm telling you  Yeah  Get some of the  Homeless guys  And just have them  Come in here  And just have  A ton of booze  All over the studio  And just keep the mics on  And don't even direct them  And see where it goes  And just listen in  It's an experiment  And just listen in  I like it  Who wouldn't check out  That show  Homeless drunk guys  With no direction  They would freak out  In DC like  Oh my god  There's no direction here  Who cares  I'd listen to that  Every day  Yeah  So here's Darren O'Toole  Her last show 
[01:24:30]  On the air  Before she got fired  Alright David Tell  Is coming up  In a few minutes  It's gonna be fun  Dave  Even I'm afraid of Dave  I'm not gonna lie  Dave is  Dave is hilarious  888-500-1069  Free FM  Alright  But now Tom Cruise  Come on  Tom Cruise  He does  He cares  Oh boy  Oh no

[01:25:30]  888-500-1069  If anyone was wondering  Why Katie Holmes  Would take a 14 hour  Plane trip to Australia  Last week  While seven and a half  Months pregnant  Just to attend  The funeral of a man  She never met  The answer would  Probably  Just  I'm just guessing  Because  My fiance is a psycho  I'm just saying 
[01:26:00]  I'm not judging  Just saying  888-500-1069  Her husband works in the fucking thing with her  Is her guy  Oh really  I know that it is part of  Her new religion  He says that  You can't have sex with your husband  You like you're  Until you're  You give birth  You are  You are  Untouchable  Star magazine 
[01:26:30]  Says that  Katie promised  Her parents  That she wouldn't  Attend the funeral  Of Carrie Parker  Oh my god  With fiance Tom  For the obvious  Health risk  Involved for the baby  So like  No pregnancy  I don't  I don't even know  Who  That guy is  Who is  Carrie Packer  Anybody know  Carrie Packer  You said 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  Carrie Packer  No  Idea  Hmm  I'll uh  I'll google him  Yeah we'll google him  And we'll figure this out  My guess is  Someone should date  But it's like  It's gotten weird  It's definitely gotten weird  It's really creepy  She's sleeping  Down the street  From him  Tom needs to have  A little more  Respect for his lady  And stop treating her  Like a walking uterus  To make obedient clones  For zenu  I'm just saying 
[01:27:30]  Jennifer Aniston  In love  Jennifer  Friends of Jennifer Aniston  Say that she and  Vince Vaughn  Met Valentine's Day  Together  And they thought  It would be the moment  When Vince  Proposed to her  Didn't happen  Didn't exactly happen  888-500-1069  Dustin you're on the air  With Darian on 1069  Free FM  Hello  Hi  Yeah hey  Um  I just want to say  Who cares about  Celebrities' lives  I don't understand  Why people spend

[01:30:30]  Support rape  Now don't drink it  If you don't want to  Motherfuckers  And they're going to  Sell anyway  No one  Why would they fire her  For what  Because of that guy  That called in  That won't go  Darian  Darian you're drunk  Off your ass  You drunk me  Bitch  If you go  I think I got problems  I had a couple  Before I came in  I didn't eat  It hit me harder  Than I thought  Look  On a daily  If she said  Something like  Every day  I come in here  And I drink  Just as much 
[01:31:00]  As I had today  But today  It just fucked me up  Man  These radio guys  I had one more shot  Than I usually do  These radio guys  Don't know how  To get ratings  They just don't know  How to  I would make promos  Out of this  Going she has lost  Her fucking mind  You better listen tomorrow  Because we honestly  Have no idea  What she's going to do  We don't know  What she's going to do  Yeah  We don't know  You want to see ratings  Go through the roof  Could be some of the  Horse tomorrow  And people still  Her phone's lit up  They probably  Dorian  You're drunk  I don't give a fuck  What happened  What you thinking about  Bitch  Here we go

I'm not sure  I only heard parts of this  I never heard it either  This is my first time  Hearing it  I guarantee  Does he call her out?  Let's take a guess  He's probably a little bit  I said no  More aware  Than the other guys  As time goes by now  And they're listening  I would assume  That people are going to  Start going  Wait a minute  She sounds a little fucked up  Dorian are you okay?  But I guarantee you  No one goes  Dorian are you  Because she has screeners too  So no one let anybody through 
[01:32:30]  No  No one calls her out  Because I bet your screen is  Because somebody  That bitch is drunk  Let me on the air with her  No  No no no  They're trying to keep  A formal show going on  So no one gets to call her out  I know this much  Someone finally calls her out  Alright  I don't know where  In the tape  But it could be this guy  Okay  Do you say yes or no?

[01:53:00]  You're experiencing technical difficulties  Please stand by  Do do do do do do do do  Hello. The Darien O'Toole Show is experiencing technical difficulties. Please stand by.  We'll be back with more of the Darien O'Toole Show in a moment.  We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please stand by.  We'll be back shortly with the Darien O'Toole Show. 
[01:53:30]  We're experiencing technical difficulties.  It's just because that's fine. Put me back in the fucking hand.  Why is it? I think I'm a shark. That's fine.  But it's like an elevator music or something.  Up and down, up and down.  Don't you hear when people push too many buttons on an elevator?  You've got to wait and wait and wait and wait.  The Darien O'Toole Show will no longer be heard in this time slot. 
[01:54:00]  Please stand by while we find another show.  Oh my God!  Darien O'Toole never existed.  We are wiping her from the sleigh.  I will never again say the name.  We hope you enjoyed the show. 
[01:54:30]  But it will not be heard again.  No reference will be made.  We are clearing the website of her images.  She never worked here.  Never existed.  You're a non-person.  Thank you.  But continue listening to Free FM.  You've got to go find someone else.  CBS is in hell in the radio world.  Oh my God.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got two more quick clips here of Darien O'Toole drunk on the air. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, what's going on with Darien?  She look wasted or what?  She just seems to be deep in thought.  I thought it was about the Olympics.  It's not.  She's got two Red Bulls in front of her.  Yeah, I know.  And whatever she's on, I wish you would share it because I could use a commie influence.  Are you on what?  Fisherman Friend?  Nothing.  What do you mean?  I know.  Nothing.  That's the sad thing.  Her man's going to...  Where is he going?  Tahoe.  He's going to Tahoe.  He's going to Tahoe this week.  Maybe I'm just going through loneliness.  She's already lonely and he has to laugh. 
[01:55:30]  Maybe you should feel sorry for me because I'm going to be lonely.  Well, listen, Miss Needy.  It's time for you to...  There's a lot of stuff you can do.  This is San Francisco.  This is true.  Can't you pick at something?  Oh, yeah.  Make someone else's life a little harder?  Oh, hell yeah.  There's homeless people to watch.  Let's go out tonight and scrub a few down.  What do you mean?  All right.  Woo!  All right.  Thank you.  I got to tell you, David Tell saved her ass.  Saved her ass.  I was going to say David.  Well, I guess not saved her ass because she got fired.  Bro.  Yeah, he tried his best. 
[01:56:00]  God bless it.  Nobody less than that could have dealt with that shit.  You know what I'm going to be like?  No, no.  I got to go.  Dave's like...  Because he did that show, though.  He was the perfect guy, I guess, to be honest.  Right.  Dealing with drunks all the time.  All the time.  He's just like hilarious.  He would have had even better audio if he wasn't there.  We have one more clip of Darian O'Toole.  Yeah.  We need to fix this.  It's ridiculous.  888-500-1069.  But come on. 
[01:56:30]  These lunatics are running wild.  It's an issue.  Let's take care of it.  We have lots more to make fun of.  Oh, my God.  We've got comedian David Tell coming up.  Fun.  What?  Substitute teacher.  He left as a man.  He came back as a woman.  All hell broke loose.  I don't think it's fair.  Gilbert Gottfried. 
[01:57:00]  We'll see you in the war.  A college student that loves to make porn on their own.  And an SF doctor working without a license.  Oh, yeah.  We've got some fun.  We've got some fun coming up here.  We've got some fun.  We've got some controversy.  We've got it all.  10 to 2.  Darian O'Toole Show.  106.9.  3FM.  And that was it.  Just a sample of her drunk on the air.  Wowie kazowie.  I got her fired. 
[01:57:30]  And they...  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  She never existed.  Bye-bye.  She never admitted she was drunk, though.  No, she didn't.  Maybe she has grounds to get her job back.  Maybe.  She had pills.  She's sick.  She's kind of sick.  Giving her some pills.  Reaction to the pills.  Yeah, that'll probably be the excuse that it was some medication.  She never said she was drunk.  Needed some medication.  Never.  And then...  It's all speculation.  If you're going to fire somebody for being drunk on the air, you should have a breathalyzer.  So when they leave, you got some numbers.  Got to get the numbers? 
[01:58:00]  Got to get the numbers.  That sounded like...  That sounded like she had quite a few in her, though.  You could have a nice buzz and kind of, you know...  It sounds like it's more than alcohol.  You think it's a little, uh...  Yeah.  She takes all kind of medicine and pills and stuff.  She probably takes pain medicine, maybe.  Yeah, it probably does.  You got to cut her some slack there.  Maybe she took a really good sleeping pill.  She's in pain.  But, like, in the middle of the night.  Yeah.  You know, you got to take that shit a lot earlier.  No, that sounded a little fresh.  She's kind of not, like...  It was a little fresh. 
[01:58:30]  She's not like a...  She's, like, all across the board.  Like, even if she was really healthy, you could see where...  Yeah.  Like, you know, she could be miserable a little bit.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you got to give her, you know, that.  I mean, you got cancer.  You don't want to be able to take some pain pills.  A couple of pain pills.  Maybe that was it.  Drank it probably with a little cup of vodka or something.  Ah, maybe, right?  I don't know.  A pint.  We'll get more.  Wash it down with a pint of vodka.  We'll get more from that story.  Let's see she get a job back.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Yeah, maybe she was just on Benadryl. 
[01:59:00]  Benadryl.  Benadryl away from Celebrity Fit Club.  All right.  We should take a break.  Twitchels is here with his fellow comedians.  They're doing the short bus tour.  Should we have them, like, try out their act?  Of course.  Absolutely.  All right.  Of course.  I think Ralphie Mae is stopping by.  He should be here, maybe.  Is he around yet?  Not yet.  All right.  Ralphie Mae's stopping by to say hi as well.  Oh, skinny ass Ralphie.  Is he getting skinny?  Yeah.  Skinnier?  I'm going to leave him alone, too.  Me and Ralphie always got some kind of...  Beef? 
[01:59:30]  You know, a lot of motherfuckers, I can fucking fuck around with this shit, you know.  Like, from Tough Crowd.  So many people hate me from Tough Crowd.  Don Marrera can't stand me.  Why?  He wants me dead.  Why?  Didn't people understand it was on TV?  It's a show?  Yeah, a lot of people just like, fuck, I ran into, what's the, Bobby Slayton?  Yeah.  Ran into him in an audition.  He's like, I refuse to do a show when you're on.  He seems like a prick.  He's not really a prick.  He's just, that's his thing.  Comes off like one.  A lot of guys, that's, but that's where I get along.  A tough guy.  A lot of guys, that's not, that's not really them. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  Like, Slayton is like crazy, but offstage, he's not, that's not him.  But then you would think he would be fine with who you are on Tough Crowd.  But it's the insecurity thing.  Like, I'm a loud fucking asshole.  I can't, that's not my act.  Him.  It's not, you know.  That's just you.  Watch out, baby.  I'm you and you and you.  I'm going to kill everybody.  And then you get offstage, it's like, hi, my name is Mr. Man.  Yeah, it's like, oh, come on, man.  Don't tell me you said you wasn't going to do it.  Because you know who's the real McCoy? 
[02:00:30]  Pat, Pat, uh, um.  Cooper?  Pat Cooper.  Yeah.  Is the real fucking McCoy.  Yeah, that guy's out of his mind.  Definitely.  You know, he's not that motherfucker, so.  He doesn't hold back.  Yeah, Pat Cooper was trashing us the other day, actually.  Yeah, he was doing.  He trashes everything.  He trashes everybody.  And it wasn't, I don't even think it was a legitimate trashing of us.  I have no idea what he was trying to say.  I would love to get him on the show to talk about this crap.  He was trashing us to trash Howard.  God, you're setting us up for a lot of bits.  We happen to have Pat Cooper audio on.  Are you joking me?  And he's trashing us. 
[02:01:00]  Please.  He's trashing us in order to trash Howard.  He was trashing Howard saying, why did you make these guys famous?  It's your fault that these guys are millionaires.  And it's because of you.  Because you, you know, brought them attention.  I bet you if you called Pat, he'd fucking talk to you.  Oh, he would in a second.  I know.  He's not a phony.  That old man is just a fucking, he is not fucking around.  Someone get the word out to Pat Cooper.  We'll have him in.  Didn't they like throw him out of the Friars Club or something? 
[02:01:30]  Oh my God.  He's so obnoxious.  He was talking about Rodney Dangerfield when he was dying.  It was so fucking brutal.  Who cares about Rodney Dangerfield?  He said, if I'm walking around with a coconut on my head, shoot me.  And then Rodney had like a tumor.  He said, if I'm walking around with a coconut growing on my head, just throw me out the window.  That's funny, man.  Pat Cooper is not a bullshit motherfucker, man.  Throw me out the window.  And Rodney Dangerfield would appreciate that joke.  Yeah.  Hey, is Ralphie May here?  No, I haven't seen him.  All right, we're waiting for Ralphie May.  Then we're going to get these comedians in for the short bus tour. 
[02:02:00]  Round Boy, who's a big fat guy.  Yeah, we'll let him do a little something.  And then we got a comic with cerebral palsy and a comic with spina bifida.  There you go.  Short bus.  Short bus tour.  And then we got Twitchell's doing his...  And Twitchell's with his Tourette's.  Tourette's.  So here we go.  Who's the leader?  We'll try to do this real fast before a break.  All right.  It's Pat Cooper trashing us in some bizarre way.  Let me tell you something.  Anybody can be tough when they got the microphone and I can't answer. 
[02:02:30]  Now I got the microphone and I'm going to tell Howard Stern he's full of shit.  Let's start with that.  He turns around and says, I can't handle fame.  I left the Howard Stern show because Howard Stern made an ass of himself when he started  fighting with Opie and Anthony.  What are you talking about?  And when he makes Opie and Anthony become big heads, beat his ass in, I said, it's time  for me to go away.  Because Opie and Anthony, he made the millionaires.  You know what Howard made me?  $35 a week.  That's the fucking difference.  People who help them, he don't help.  Is Pat Cooper... 
[02:03:00]  Is that a trashing?  Nah.  I see it as...  It's absolutely not a trashing.  What happened was when Pat Cooper found out that Howard Stern had a gag order on us,  he couldn't believe it.  And he's a stand-up guy.  He said, you know what?  I can't be part of your crap.  If you're putting gag orders on fellow radio guys...  Years ago, when Pat didn't do...  When he stopped doing Stern.  Yeah.  Years.  Some of the funniest Pat Cooper and some of the funniest moments on Stern's show was  when Pat Cooper was on.  Boom.  Maybe years ago.  Who told you that?  Who told you that? 
[02:03:30]  Who told you that?  Who told you that?  When he just kept yelling that over and over again.  Got funnier every time.  What does he mean by Howard made us famous?  I don't know.  He's saying that...  You hear at the end, he goes, what has he made me?  $35?  He's like, why would he give you guys...  The time of day.  The time of day.  Right.  So basically what he's saying is it's like you look up to somebody or you respect somebody.  It's just like if I look at you guys like, you know what?  Y'all some serious...  If I'm out there going, these two are some serious motherfuckers. 
[02:04:00]  And then Joe Blow, the new radio guy, comes around and he goes, you two bitch-ass niggas.  And y'all go, hey man, forget him.  That guy's an asshole.  I don't want to deal with him.  Pat's kind of like, what motherfucker?  And I can't make money?  He's not...  He's saying, why not him?  He shouldn't have given us the time of day.  Right.  It's like you represented...  Basically he's giving you a compliment because he's saying you're the guys. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  He's not...  He could have said anybody.  He's disappointed in Howard that Howard didn't try to fight back.  Instead, went behind the scenes with the gag or shit.  He couldn't believe that someone like Howard would do that.  He's saying...  Because that's not the Howard that he thought he knew.  Right.  He's saying, like, fucking...  He let you guys fuck.  And he's just a crotchety old fuck.  And he's a fucking...  Even if he is trashing you, he's Pat Cooper.  I take it as a compliment.  It's kind of fun.  He's a brutal animal.  More audio.  People will help if he don't help.  But he helps fucking Opie and Anthony.  But I don't understand. 
[02:05:00]  Gary, I never heard from you.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  Shut up, Robin.  Because he's telling everybody, I left because I can't handle fame.  That's bullshit.  No, that's not true.  That's not what he ever said.  No, no.  He never said that.  He said it a couple of weeks ago.  Don't tell me anything.  He said that that's one aspect of your personality is that you can't handle fame.  But that's not why you left the show.  Yeah, but I got to know, why did you leave the show?  Because I...  No, I left it because when I saw the energy that he made two assholes, big stars for no fucking reason at all.  But how did he do that?  I don't understand.  Holy shit. 
[02:05:30]  Two assholes, big stars for no fucking reason.  But what's the problem with that, you two assholes?  We are assholes.  I don't give a shit.  I'll give him that.  We are assholes.  But he makes you think that Howard made us famous.  I don't think that's what he's saying.  You got to work at this shit every day.  You can't just go on the radio and wait for someone to start talking about it.  And then you become famous.  You become big in this industry because you work your balls off and come up with some interesting radio.  I think he's saying, I think he knows innately that I don't think Howard made you. 
[02:06:00]  I think he's saying the energy that he put into you guys.  Yeah.  Not that he said, oh, I touched these guys and made them.  He's saying, motherfucker, put that energy into me.  Why are you putting energy into these two motherfuckers?  Right, right.  Don't even waste this time.  Because he did mention the money.  I made $35 from...  $35.  Let's go back to this.  That he made two assholes big stars for no fucking reason at all.  But how did he do that?  I don't know what you know.  Opie and Anthony, he said, don't you talk to me.  I won't talk to you.  You're taking my material.  I said, he's taking your material. 
[02:06:30]  Howard, how the fuck are you taking your material?  There's only one you, Howard.  Why do you make assholes get you angry?  You can't play in my yard.  You got the ball.  That's bullshit.  So you know what I said?  All his energy on two assholes.  Why not use the energy on people who do his show much more better than those two fucking assholes?  Why make them millionaires?  Why?  Because he made them side.  I don't think that that was his intention.  You have no idea why he took the attitude toward them that he did.  He said they were stealing my material.  But that's what he said. 
[02:07:00]  Does Howard Stern own the?  Does Howard Stern own the bout?  Does Howard Stern say, I owe I, I owe you?  Who the fuck does this man think?  He's not Jesus Christ.  And what should he have done for you?  What should he have done for you?  No, wait a minute.  Give me a fucking break.  This man don't walk on fucking water.  You're saying that energy was misdirected on those two guys that could have gone to people that he liked.  So what energy did you not get from him?  My argument is this.  Why waste your time that these two assholes become bigger when they shouldn't?  Because they're dickheads. 
[02:07:30]  These two fucking guys are dickheads.  You got great guests.  Not me.  I'll give them that.  Great guests.  Push them.  Help them.  Pick them up with a car once in a fucking while.  They got to take a fucking subway six in the fucking morning.  I blame that on Les Moonves.  Am I right?  Did you pick up anybody with a car?  Howard don't go for shit when it comes to picking up a fucking car for picking up a check.  Where is he?  If I work for Howard Stern, I tell him, Howard, you're full of shit when he is full of shit.  Pat, I genuinely don't see how he made the millionaires.  I don't see that correlation.  Because of the publicity. 
[02:08:00]  He made every paper in the country.  Hello?  For like a minute.  And then...  Oh, how about a week and a week and a half, two weeks?  Everybody said, Pat, what is this man?  I said, because Howard don't see the forest for the fucking trees.  He's just going to take his material.  He's got no fucking material.  He is what he is.  He's a genius of his fucking self.  I'm a genius of myself.  I'm A plus company.  You understand?  I do.  Wait a minute.  You throw your friend under the bus because you see him making a mistake?  No.  No. 
[02:08:30]  That's not a mistake.  That's not a mistake, honey.  That's not thinking.  He's a genius.  Goes to college and he says, let's get two dickheads and make the popular.  Fuck them.  They're two dickheads.  Oh, by the way.  You two fucking dickheads.  I was around before Howard Stern was picking ants with his fucking nose.  Right.  Let's start that.  But I don't understand what that means.  See, basically...  That is so funny.  You cannot be mad at Pat Cooper.  No.  He's just brutal.  No.  He's brutalizing the entire envelope.  He's just peeing on the world.  He is...  Fuck you. 
[02:09:00]  Fuck Stern.  He's a machine gunner spinning in circles.  He's not.  No bullshit motherfucker.  He's just wiping everybody out.  Fuck everybody.  He don't care.  He doesn't care.  He...  You could have been anybody...  Yeah.  ...motherfucking...  But you...  Didn't matter.  The compliment is that you were the dude...  You are specifically the dudes who he thinks have hit that mantle.  Right.  He didn't mention anybody else.  No.  So to him, it's like he made you guys, you know, you the guys. 
[02:09:30]  But it could have been anybody.  He's looking at you as the guys that ain't him.  You know what I'm saying?  I take it as I'm flattered to be shit on by Pat Cooper.  I think that's a fucking tremendous thing right there.  I'm flattered to be shit on by Pat Cooper.  Get Pat Cooper on the phone.  God bless Pat Cooper.  Get him on the phone.  Get him on the phone.  I love him.  I can't...  He's just an angry...  He was throwing punches everywhere.  Just an old angry...  He is legitimately a throwback to like...  Oh.  There's someone out there that knows Pat Cooper. 
[02:10:00]  Get him to call the show now.  But what was he on?  Was he on the show?  No.  It's the show after the show.  After the show.  Don't you know how that works over there, Patrice?  It's all about Howard.  So he does his show, and then after Howard's show, there's a show that they do about the  show you just heard.  I kid you not.  Was he on the show?  No.  Howard doesn't do that.  No.  He's not allowed...  Howard does his show.  He's not allowed on the show.  He's allowed on the after show.  No, no, no.  Pat Cooper wasn't on the show. 
[02:10:30]  That's right.  Right.  Oh, okay.  He was on the after the show?  Yeah.  And Howard doesn't do the after show.  See, Pat was on the after show.  Not good enough for the show show.  Right.  But then they do the after show, and then there's news about the show and the after show, and  then they replay the show.  It's kind of like the post-Super Bowl show, and you're a football player, and they just  let you kind of throw some passes.  This is from the guy that wouldn't sell t-shirts or coffee mugs with his image because he  was worried about overexposure.  There you go.  Let's get through the Pat Cooper audio. 
[02:11:00]  There's like a minute left here.  Get Pat Cooper on this damn radio program, please.  Dickheads and make them popular.  Fuck them.  They're two dickheads.  Oh, by the way, I was around before Howard Stern was picking ants with his fucking nose.  Right.  Let's start back.  But I don't deal with that.  Because, because, because, because he is not the only one to do what he has been doing.  That's been done for years.  He got in the door because he did it the right way.  But he's doing it the best now.  I didn't say no.  The man is a fucking genius.  As far as I'm concerned. 
[02:11:30]  A fucking genius.  Anybody that loves Stan Kinison, it can't be that fucking dumb.  Was that revisionist history, or am I missing something?  That's how I feel.  Because Robin and I were just saying, I remember he was mad about the Opie and Anthony thing,  but the thing that he was mad about was not that Howard made the millionaires.  His exact quote was, when he could be quoted this way,  was, who the fuck is Howard to tell anybody what to do?  Right.  That's what it was.  That's what the anger was.  Not about, he made these two idiots millionaires.  That's new.  Yeah, all of a sudden now, it's Howard wasn't good to his friends. 
[02:12:00]  Guys like that are so classic for, like, what they focus on.  Like, why is he so focused on Opie and Anthony?  Like, why is that an issue?  Yeah, why should he even care about him?  Yeah, like, Howard, his, Howard's opinion of them,  I'm like, what does that involve?  You know what?  If I could have thought of all the things that would have alienated us from Pat,  that would have been, like, 150th on my list.  Yeah, it's just weird that he's focusing on that.  It's hilarious.  No, it's a great point, you know?  It's a good point, because he said,  Howard, who's been the champion of free speech in a lot of people's eyes.  And taken on all the enemies and all that. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, things like that.  And taken on all other radio shows.  We're the first radio show he did not take on, by the way.  The first one.  Yeah, not on the radio behind the scenes.  And the only one, by the way.  Thank you very much.  But he knew he didn't have what it took to take us on, you know,  with his radio show.  So Pat got pissed about that,  and God bless Pat, was able to go right up to his face and say,  look, you told him to shut up.  You made them, you went to the boss and made them not talk about you anymore. 
[02:13:00]  And I got a problem with that.  Eh, good.  I just, I find it fun.  When he calls us dickheads and assholes, it's hysterical to me.  And he'll be on the phone.  I love it.  I guarantee you he'll call you dickheads on the phone.  Yeah.  You two dickheads.  He says nothing for me.  Let's get Pat Cooper on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know how we do that.  Book him.  I think he was trying to get on our show a while back.  Maybe we have a number for him.  Yeah, book him.  Let's go to Lou in New York.  Lou?  Hey, hi, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, I got a little information on Pat.  Matter of fact, I know you guys from the downtown.  I did your... 
[02:13:30]  Are you a friend of Pat Cooper's?  Yes, I am.  Then tell him to call the show right now.  Well, I don't have his number.  Put it this way.  I'm an acquaintance.  I used to work some shows with him.  Just to let you know that he is that way on and off stage.  The man is never off.  All right.  Well, we just want to get him on the show.  It's great you're a friend of his, but try to get a hold of him for us.  If I can, I certainly will try.  And you guys are great.  I'm probably one of your oldest listeners.  I'm at 60 years old, but you guys make me laugh every day.  All right, Lou.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Take care.  So, there you go. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, Pat.  That was good.  Ben, fans, Pat, and email.  You two dickheads.  We'll have him on tomorrow, I bet you.  Yeah, dickheads and assholes.  You dickheads.  Or later today.  You two dickheads.  Make them millionaires.  No, I mean, you still got to work at the job.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  You know, we knew when we came to New York that it would be a smart move to get under  Howard's skin.  We knew that.  Of course.  After we got an audience.  Yeah.  Of course we knew that.  But you also have to do compelling radio on a daily basis. 
[02:14:30]  When he left originally, it was because the gag order that he put on you.  Yeah, that pissed him off.  Yes, absolutely.  But why didn't he come?  I guess I asked the moment of the question.  Why didn't he come to you guys to say, you know, he just goes.  Because we're assholes and dickheads.  You're dickheads.  He's like, fuck you.  Why go on that show?  The gag order, by the way, that was well reported.  You could Google that and read about that.  That was a fun few months. 
[02:15:00]  Why don't we take a break?  Ralphie Mays here.  And then we got Twitchels and his comedy troupe.  Short bus tour.  Yeah, we'll talk about the short bus tour as well.  You're listening to Big Tracks, XM 49.  Actually, one of the songs they play on the new channel on XM.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:15:30]  What's wrong?  What happened?  He's giving Patrice the update on Club Soda Kenny.  It was in all the papers, you know.  Yeah, he's doing all right.  He's doing fine.  It'll work out, man.  Looks like it's going to work out for him just fine.  We don't have an update yet.  When we do, we'll tell everybody.  We also got to say hi to Ralphie Mays in studio.  Ralphie.  Hi, kids.  How are you?  What are you promoting, Ralphie?  Some stupid spot in Poughkeepsie tomorrow night.  Poughkeepsie, huh?  Poughkeepsie and then like Hasbro Heights on Saturday.  Bananas?  Yeah, bananas. 
[02:16:00]  There you go.  We know all the clubs.  Y'all do know all the clubs.  Got to.  We make them a lot of money here.  Y'all do.  We try.  Your fans come out and then they gripe at me.  Why don't you do the show more often?  I say because your brethren shitbags on me all over the message boards.  That's why I don't fucking do it more often.  What have you thought about?  There you go.  They're fucking brutal on their message boards.  See another one.  We know.  Exactly.  You got to watch the message boards.  You got to stop reading the message boards.  Leave them a little fucking awful message board. 
[02:16:30]  Just walk away.  I get sent excerpts in email.  Really?  And this is what they said about you.  Just in case you don't go to the message board.  Let me cut and paste this excerpt and you could read it and pity yourself.  That's how shitty you were.  Apparently somebody in Iowa thinks I'm making them fat over the radio.  Isn't that a bitch?  I'm getting blamed for other people's obesity.  Hey, you had the surgery?  Can we talk about the surgery?  Yeah, sure.  Because our own Big Kev had the same thing done.  Ralphie, you had your stomach stapled a while ago, right? 
[02:17:00]  I had a gastric bypass in November of 2003 and I've lost like 250 pounds since then.  Holy shit.  I did that show Celebrity Fit Club and I got hurt.  I got a huge hernia and I had to have that fixed.  And while I was in there, they said, you know, we can take all this whole bottom gut and all this extra skin.  I'm like, really?  Take it off, all right?  And the next day I was in surgery and they took 40 pounds of gut.  I got a lap now.  I never had a lap.  Holy shit. 
[02:17:30]  40 pounds.  40 pounds.  We're going to make an ottoman out of it.  Did you get to see it?  What?  No, no.  That would have been cool though, wouldn't it?  No.  What is that?  Just going to some biohazard waste fucking canister?  It's actually been donated.  Yeah, they make shampoo out of it.  No.  Stop it.  I'm telling you, they make shampoo out of it.  But they donated for someone's skin graft.  Make a guy like Scoliope.  Scoliope.  They'll just give him new eyebrows.  Half a Hulk face.  They'll just post someone's skin out there.  Sorry about the freckles if you're out there and you got my skin. 
[02:18:00]  Sorry about the freckles.  What about, did they have to rebuild your belly button or were they able to cut around it?  Yeah, they cut around it and put it back through.  Put it back where it belongs.  Yeah.  That is the oddest goddamn thing, man.  It is so weird.  Surgery is just the oddest fucking what they're doing these days.  They just keep asking me to do fucking Celebrity Fit Cup, man.  Yeah.  You should, dude.  I just can't.  Why?  I don't know.  My career is more important than my health.  Yeah.  You're already on VH1.  It's not like it's a step down. 
[02:18:30]  It's like, I just can't.  I just can't have somebody, you know, the white girl, you know, thinking that I've been  raped.  That's why I eat pasta.  Fucking the Lou Gossett character who's telling me to have a nice fucking day as I'm telling  him to suck my dick as I'm trying to fuck all the fat girls on here.  Trying to fuck Tempest and oh, it's all right, fat bitch.  Come on.  Yeah, they got to get rid of the psychologist.  Your goal, Patrice, is going to be eight pounds this week.  Thank you, Louis. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you.  I want your DOR.  I got no place else to go.  D-O-R, Patrice.  Find Patrice hung in the closet.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  I got nowhere else to go.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  I got them all.  You do.  You have them all.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go. 
[02:19:30]  I got nowhere else to go.  Larry.  I ain't got nothing else.  I got nothing else.  I ain't got nothing else.  And another big thing, Ant.  Is the guy.  Ant's the dude that doesn't have to be on it.  Oh, yeah.  Blech.  What is the story with Ant?  He has changed.  I don't know how much surgery he's had, but it's apparently a lot. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  What is he doing to himself?  I don't know.  He is.  You look at the first season to now.  Yeah.  Completely different guy.  I mean, like.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  Botox.  Oh.  I would say Botox.  Hair plugs.  Hair plugs.  Something's going on with the hair.  Lipo.  Wow.  There might be even more going on.  A little nip tuck.  That faggy little look he gives at the end of the show where it's kind of over his shoulder  before he walks away. 
[02:20:30]  Activate the scales.  And he purses his lips and turns around.  I want to be a fag basher at that point.  I want to be someone who just punches him in the face for being gay.  He makes a face.  It's just.  You guys.  Activate the scales.  You guys that do the show, you guys are wimps.  You never called him out on his crap.  Oh, are you kidding me?  I was up there all the time.  I go, hey, can you be a little less get Queenie?  Queenie.  Please stop.  Hey, Queenie.  I'm talking about Jesus.  You're Queenie.  Just a con and whatever.  Hey, say it a little more, Butch. 
[02:21:00]  Please stop.  I mean, he turns it up.  He becomes Paul Lynn for no reason.  Jesus.  Hey, it's like, what happened?  It's more, not even the gay thing.  It's more like, you know, he acts like his shit don't stink.  The guy's never done a push-up in his life.  He doesn't know how to exercise or eat right or in that crap.  He has that weird, big chest.  Chastising people.  You ought to be a rail.  His chest and his stomach are the same size.  Like, he's completely a barrel shape. 
[02:21:30]  He gets no ass in Santa Monica.  And the fucking four.  In the village.  He's a one in Santa Monica.  You ever see those Santa Monica fags?  They will kick your ass and fuck you.  They're extra fags.  They are fucking built like those old Greek statues with the fucking, with the leaf on  the dick.  Right.  Those are those fags in fucking Santa Monica.  And that awful ant.  And that's ant.  Oh, man. 
[02:22:00]  I almost got beat up by one of those fags in L.A.  I was, my trainer was like, I want you to walk on this treadmill for four miles.  And I fucking snapped.  I'm like, four miles?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Look at that.  That's like 16 miles of that little faggot over there.  And I said it way too loud.  And the little faggot came over and got kind of pissy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you don't want to be beat up by a gay guy.  How'd you get out of it?  I said, I'm sorry.  I was just, I wasn't talking about you. 
[02:22:30]  I was talking about that.  By the way, you look great.  That's faggot over there.  I was talking.  No, I said, by the way, you look great.  And keep up the good work.  I mean, that's dangerous, dude.  I mean, that's like going to Compton yelling, nigger, nigger.  Yeah, you're going to get fucked up.  Not in Santa Monica, dude.  Not in Santa Monica.  I don't know if you ever, you know, they got some good restaurants in Santa Monica.  Oh, is that why you were there?  Ah, come on.  What are you going to turn it into, I was hanging out?  No.  I wasn't until you fucking made an excuse as to why you were there. 
[02:23:00]  They got great restaurants there.  You fucking, just in case you're wondering.  I was leaving you alone.  You know, Sullivan, that's fucking very fair you called me out on that.  I did try to anti-fag myself.  You know, fags eat deliciously, and I like to eat deliciously, too.  I know.  I just say I'm gay because I want to have low carbs in my life, nigger.  In the middle of that, you were starting to see that we're like,  Oh, yeah, it's Patrice going to Santa Monica.  He's like, damn, I think they're wonder-wise in Santa Monica. 
[02:23:30]  Santa Monica.  I'll throw this little tip in into the conversation.  There's a fine line between whores and sissies in L.A.  You know, have you ever seen the textile production in Santa Monica?  I was doing some studying on opening a factory there,  and textiles are a great to export.  That's hilarious.  It's one of my hobbies, I thought you would use.  I really got called that.  You know, I deserved that, because I really was trying to anti-  Listen.  You're trying to turn around on me.  I eat beef.  See, a lot of times, motherfuckers. 
[02:24:00]  Listen, we've got to get Twitchels and the gang in here.  Oh, shit.  You want to watch some comedy, Ralphie?  Sure.  And comment?  Sure.  That's what we're going to do tonight.  Anyone else?  We've got to get a bunch of guys in here for this.  That's what these guys do.  Let's start with Twitchels.  Get Twitchels in here.  We've got Twitchels.  This is the short bus comedy tour.  We've got Twitchels over here.  He's got Tourette's, and he's a stand-up comic.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm actually pretty calm today.  Are you?  You didn't have as many Red Bulls or anything like that?  Well, you know, no.  They weren't shoved in my face this time, so I figured I didn't have to. 
[02:24:30]  And if you say jump or he sees jump, the word jump too many times, he has to jump.  That's part of my OCD.  Are you serious?  Yeah, because he's got OCD.  I have obsessive compulsive disorder.  I was diagnosed when I was seven with Tourette's, and I also have OCD, so whenever I hear that  word, it kind of triggers it.  And in order to feel better, he's got to jump.  It's like a thing.  Wow.  Yeah.  So really, if you say jump, he has to do, like, how high?  Yeah, he's jumping right now.  Jump, how high?  Then there's...  That's fabulous.  Jimmy Graham. 
[02:25:00]  Make him do it again, Anthony.  Sex is great.  Is that great?  Do it again.  Do it again.  Jump.  Jump.  See, I sent my ticter comp before I came in here.  That's fucking kick ass, man.  That's awesome.  Isn't that great, man?  Wait till we do it in front of about 1,000 people next Friday night.  Friday night, Friday, 11 a.m.  Friday afternoon.  Right.  11 to 2 we're broadcasting, right?  11 to 2, Hard Rock Cafe next Friday for St. Paddy's Day.  St. Paddy's Day.  Hey, St. Paddy's Day.  And Twitchels will be there jumping for everyone because that's all you're going to hear from 
[02:25:30]  the crowd is jump.  Yeah.  That's very good to know that that's important.  We wanted you to sing, like, a karaoke song with the word jump.  Hey, man, I'm out for it.  I'm out for it.  I'm out for it.  Jump.  Yeah.  Definitely.  What was that?  I love when we got Noobie in the studio.  Was that there at all too?  He just has to do that, Ralphie.  Oh, okay.  Sometimes you just have to release.  My bad.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes it's just like, what is it like?  Build up, right? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it's like an itch.  You can't itch.  And you try to control it.  But eventually you're like, oh, fuck it.  I'm going to let it loose.  In high school, I would always let it loose when I got home.  Do you yell, like, a cunt for no reason?  I used to yell a lot of vulgarity, but that's actually kind of decreased when I got older.  So now it's more like the facial tics, the grunting.  I have this one tic where I, you guys haven't seen much, but I do like the head tic sometimes.  That's like a whole upper body tic.  It's like the blowjob tic.  Oh, it's really, really bad. 
[02:26:30]  It really is.  Because that times my neck starts to hurt, then my doctor will give me muscle relaxers to try to calm it down and everything.  It's just, it's crazy to handle, but I'm not medicated for it.  You better not walk through Santa Monica with that tic.  Oh, wow.  And for the record, I'm not medicated for my Tourette.  I heard that.  Therese told me.  Delicious.  It's so awesome.  We do all sorts of bets with Twitchels, by the way.  Yeah, I'm psyched about the Short Plus Comedy Tour.  The guys are here to talk to you guys about and everything.  This is really going to be a fun tour.  We got Mike. 
[02:27:00]  He's got cerebral palsy.  Yeah, we have this really, we have a really good lineup of comedians.  This is for comedians.  It's myself, of course, who has Tourette's.  Then we got a comedian named Mike Cateo, who's really, really getting his name out there in New York.  He has cerebral palsy.  Cerebral or cerebral?  Cerebral, cerebral.  I don't know how to say it exactly.  I don't know that.  Cerebral palsy.  Then we have Timmy Grill.  Tim Grill, who has spina bifida.  Spina bifida.  Spina bifida.  I blame his parents giving him the name Timmy.  Timmy fucking Hacks.  Those are all characters from X-Men 3. 
[02:27:30]  Cerebral palsy man.  Spina bifida.  Spina bifida.  And then we...  Shoots growths out at you from his spine.  And then we have Jimmy Graham, who's our token fat guy.  He actually used to be my wrestling coach when I was a kid.  But he's not even that fat.  He's...  If you're going to have a friend.  Man, I feel disappointed.  Yeah, right?  He's one of the two fat men in the room right now.  No, but it's cool because he actually... 
[02:28:00]  Well, he actually teaches special ed, too, so he has a really good step back.  Oh, he does?  So he's kind of the driver of the short bus?  Absolutely.  Well, that's what I was talking about last week.  Everybody got the permission to sleep.  You put this together?  We're going on.  Yeah, I put it together.  I thought of it, and I approached the guys.  And where's it going to be at?  We're premiering at the Laugh Factory, April 13th, 9 o'clock at the end.  And it's Thursday, April 13th at the Laugh Factory, and that's when we're kicking it off.  In New York, right?  Say that again?  The one in New York?  Yep, right here in Times Square in New York City.  It's going to be April 13th.  We're really psyched about this.  All the info will be on my site, laughterbyloo.com. 
[02:28:30]  You really are calm today.  Some days are just like this, huh?  Some days, you know what?  Some days I have my close friend and family.  I mean, it's fine.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, I'm just saying.  He motherfuckers made him a celebrity.  Some days it's like that, and some days it's not.  I was in Philly, and I said, listen, because I'm looking at him like an open mic hack that he is.  And I go, I said, why don't you come by, you know, if you're in Philly?  He goes, I might, but I might have some things to do.  I'm like, hey.  No, no, no.  What the hell do you fucking have you?  No, no.  He asked me the day he was doing healing.  Now, wait a second. 
[02:29:00]  The day he was doing, you fucking Tourette Middle?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm like, no, no.  Don't even go there.  He told me.  He wanted me to give me a spot when he was doing healing, right?  I was doing that chiller theater.  I was doing the chiller theater of them already.  A fucking theater.  I was already booked.  I was like, what do you do, motherfucker?  Right back at you, bitch.  I mean, give me a bite.  I left this mother.  I was like, hey, come on through and people will love it.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Don't know, man.  I didn't say I don't know.  I said, yeah, man, I loved you.  Not one bit of Tourette's.  All right, we'll see what happens.  You're joking.  We'll see.  We'll see, Patrice.  Yeah, maybe I'll be there.  Yeah, maybe.  He lives five minutes away.  Dude, I am so sorry.  I'll get right over there, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm so psyched about the ringtones, because that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for  you, because I met the guy who killed the theater.  Oh, my fucking bitch.  He's going to make a bloody fortune with the ringtones.  Because he goes, brrring, sometimes.  Brrring.  I want that on my phone.  I'm going to play right now.  It's looking pretty cool.  Thank you, man.  I really appreciate that. 
[02:30:00]  I want that.  You got that recorded, too?  On here is a little ringtone.  You record that for me before you leave.  I'm throwing that on my phone.  Dude, you'll get hooked up.  It's really funny, because we're really excited about it, because it's coming out really soon,  and they wouldn't have it if it wasn't for you.  Nah, nah, nah.  Bleh.  Oh, look at it.  Robbie doesn't know what to say.  I love it.  I got to be honest with you.  Y'all are like the best pranksters in the business.  I don't know if he's faking.  I got to be honest with you.  We went through that period with him.  We're like, this has got to be a thing.  I get that all the time. 
[02:30:30]  But it's not.  There's too much energy being expelled by him to do this.  Trust me, there's time.  He's like in pain.  And when he's not in here and just sitting out there, we've had him out there for sometimes  two, three hours.  And you glance over, and he's just like in the chair all contorted and twitching.  Too much work.  Yeah, that would be too much.  You would really just tire yourself out trying to pull that off.  Craig in New York.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I wanted to know when we were going to do some twitchless betting again.  Me and my guys at work want to put some bets down.  Do you want to do one quick bet? 
[02:31:00]  Ralphie's never seen it.  Hello?  Tourette's phone.  Hello?  My Tourette's is ringing.  That would be when the phone rings.  And then you've got to get one for like a text message.  Yeah, there you go.  Text message is coming in.  And then you have a voicemail.  When you turn that down, put that shit on.  I'll cough break.  How do these guys get ringtones? 
[02:31:30]  You guys, the ringtones are coming out really soon.  They're just fixing out some technical stuff.  You can go to laughterbyloo.com to get the ringtones.  All right, good enough.  And it'll be available on a lot of other sites.  So, Craig, what do you want to bet on today?  Uh, are we going to do the times again or what?  Yeah, we can do a quick bet on the time thing.  All right, how long he can stand there without, like, an outburst.  And I can do facial tics, you guys said.  Yeah, you're allowed to do facial tics.  All right, got it.  Just any kind of vocal outburst. 
[02:32:00]  We go completely silent, Ralphie, and then we try to figure out how long he can stay silent  before he has to do his thing.  I've had a lot of practice.  I can do this.  I mean, I'm really mellow today.  All right, that'll help with the bedding.  That kind of changes it up.  And they love bedding in their cubicles.  They love this.  Hey, you know what?  I want to give a shout-out to my MySpace people.  They're awesome.  They love this stuff.  They love the bedding.  That's been a really favorite one.  I only got, like, four bucks.  I don't have a five or anything.  I got, like, $2.50.  I'll put an end up.  Damn. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, okay.  We're going to have to do cheap bets today.  This was an unexpected twitchel sighting.  I mean, I got some, uh, oh.  I got, like, a 10 and some 20s.  That's all I got.  What are we doing?  $5 a man?  Something like that.  I got it, huh?  $5.  $5.  There we go.  $5 a man.  $5 a man.  Anybody else want in?  We'll do one big bet.  Whoever wants in, just come in with your pot.  I got him in.  Patrice is throwing change in.  He's got change.  Patrice just threw that money like he was driving through a toll. 
[02:33:00]  I don't know what that was.  I got you, Patrice.  Anyone have change?  There's change in there now.  There's change in there now.  Take out $15 for your $20.  Yeah, take out $15.  Oh, all right, all right.  Here you go.  There it is.  All right.  Who's in?  Write down your, write down how long you think he could last before he has to scream and yell.  I need a pen.  All right.  And I'll take, uh, I'll take a little breath here.  I'm not going to take one of the pens out of there when Jimmy put up his ass. 
[02:33:30]  Jimmy was a little annoyed that people were chewing on the ends of the pen, so he took  one pen and stuck it up his asshole and put it in with all the pens, and that way you  never know if you're getting a pen that Jimmy had up his ass.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Isn't that wonderful?  All right, get your bets in in Radioland, because we're going to do this in the next couple  of minutes.  All right, let me think.  How long will he stay quiet before he starts?  I really want to nail this one.  With his Tourette's.  That's a new one, nigga.  That was...  That was all sold. 
[02:34:00]  If you got your bets, hand it in.  American werewolf.  Hand it in.  That's enough.  That's enough.  Stay on the road.  Stay off the moors.  Have you seen Thea Vidal on a wrestling?  What?  She plays one of the wrestler's mothers now.  What?  Who?  Thea.  Really?  Thea Vidal.  She plays...  What's the black...  What's his name?  Sean Benjamin.  She plays his mama. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, you know...  Yeah, I had lunch with Mark Henry two weeks ago, right before a Raw.  She said that.  All right, let's...  Names.  Yep.  How'd you have lunch with Mark...  Did he fucking...  Let's get all the bets in here.  It was one of those pre-promo things right before the match.  Oh, okay.  Sexual chocolate.  Then and I might have to split the pot.  Uh-oh.  It's only $32.  There we go.  It's only $32 because Patrice had two fitty.  There should only be $30.  It's actually $250 more than everybody.  All right, leave it in there.  One, two, three, four.  I only have five bets, though. 
[02:35:00]  Hold on.  I got to think here.  Anybody else?  Anybody else outside want to bet?  $5.  $5.  $5 a man.  Give it.  That's a pretty good one.  We're just waiting for Anthony's bet, and we'll do this fast.  And I'll give it to you, too, your mother.  Let's see.  What do you got there?  Holy crap.  Sorry.  What?  Nothing.  Ah!  Jesus.  I'm telling you, man.  Holy shit, that scared the crap out of me. 
[02:35:30]  I turned my volume way down, bro.  Wow.  It's awesome.  You got to back up a little when you know one of those is coming.  I know.  Pterodactyl.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  It's a baby pterodactyl.  Holy crap.  I don't even know when it's coming.  Anybody else?  All bets are in?  All right.  All right.  We got to get them on the clock.  We going to use the old stopwatch we got?  Stopwatch.  Who's not betting?  E-Rock?  I'm not.  All right.  You'll be the official timer.  You ready?  I'm ready, guys.  I'm all set.  As soon as we say go, he's just got to shut the hell up as long as he can. 
[02:36:00]  Here we go.  Bets are in in Radioland.  We're going to go in a couple seconds here.  Twitchels, go.  Coming up on the 30-second mark. 
[02:36:30]  Right there.  Fold it.  All right.  Oh, damn it.  47? 
[02:37:00]  What was it?  Official 48 seconds officially?  48.  Who had 48?  God damn, I had 57.  I was really hoping you were calm today.  72 seconds.  Well, you know, the silence, the staring at me, that adds to the pressure.  Patrice had 40, so I guess he wins if it's 48.  You missed by a second, Anthony.  How did I miss by a second?  48 would give you nine seconds.  It was a way.  You had 57.  48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 45, 56, 57.  Nine.  All right.  Maybe he tries to be split.  I had him in.  Damn it.  You lost by a second. 
[02:37:30]  Ralphie Mae had 72 seconds.  Motherfucker didn't even have enough money to put in.  I know.  I'm going to pay my man Ralphie back.  Let me get some change.  Pay my man.  You might.  Hey, Ralphie, I got change.  Not bad.  Ah, damn.  Not a bad day's work.  There you go.  Damn.  I am a mush when it comes to this guy.  He got a free sandwich out of there.  I think everyone's won at least one.  I have not won one bet on this guy.  They loved it on Pal Talk because the faces he was making to make sure he didn't do anything. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  Well, there you go.  A mess.  We usually do that all morning long and just waste time.  Let's say hi to Nathan in Arizona.  Nathan.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  As I called the Chief Ralphie, we talked about this stunt he pulled on the radio station here  in Arizona a couple weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  It was phenomenal.  One of the guys, they took this serosinquinous fluid that's being pumped out of me by the  wound vac and they dunked it on a tater tot and ate it.  I swear to God.  All right.  No.  It was the most gross thing I've ever seen in my life.  No way. 
[02:38:30]  Wait.  What's going on with you?  I got this pump, the wound vac, and there's this fluid.  It looks kind of like apple juice.  It's a blood product.  It's a serosinquinous fluid or something like that.  I can't pronounce it properly.  I apologize.  And that's pumping into your system to help out the wound?  No, it's being pumped out to keep the wound dry.  Isn't that...  Is that...  Exactly, brother.  That's how I'm feeling.  Exactly.  Is that the gunk produced by the lymphatic glands?  Why, I believe it is, sir.  Can we see what it looks like?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:39:00]  Do you have to carry this around?  Oh, God.  I cannot look.  No, it's not bad.  I just can't see everything.  You have to walk around?  It's in a little...  So it's like that juice.  It's a little purse.  Look, you can see it in the line.  Holy shit.  Mm-hmm.  How much have you collected today?  I just changed the thing, so not much.  Get the PalTalk camera over there a little bit.  How much...  Oh, my God.  Oh!  I know.  It's gross.  I'm sorry.  I have wound problems.  How much do you collect a day? 
[02:39:30]  It looks like maybe there's a couple shots worth in there right now.  Nah, not even one.  Not even one.  Okay, if you tilt it like that.  Yeah, not even one shot.  No.  It's not a lot of juice.  It's not...  The wound's not that big.  It was before.  It was like...  I was getting like 300 milliliters a day, which is a lot, dude.  That's a pain in the ass.  You gotta kill it.  Blah, blah, blah.  How long you gotta carry that thing around with a tube in ya?  Probably another three weeks.  And you're still doing comedy?  Do you place that on a stool next to yourself? 
[02:40:00]  No, no, no, no.  I mean...  Dress it up like a puppet and do a ventriloquist.  Right, right.  I mean...  I unplug it.  I unplug it.  Yeah.  I just...  That's what it sounds like when you unplug it.  Dude.  That is so scary, dude.  Like, nobody dunked a tater tot in that.  I swear to God, dude.  And they got pictures of it.  It's on KUPD's website.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And I heard you got a guy here who licked a booger from...  Voss's booger.  That's pretty gross.  That's Bill.  Voss pulled one out where it was hanging a good five inches from the tip of his finger. 
[02:40:30]  It was one of those bungee cord ones.  It was a bungee one.  Thick.  Whitish, greenish.  And very viscous and rubbery.  Oh, nicotined out?  Yeah.  That's what gave Dan and Reeve the cancer.  And Bill stuck his tongue out and touched it with his tongue, thinking it was just going  to touch and come off, and it stuck to his tongue.  Oh, wow.  So he kind of had to fight it a little to get it off, and it was horrific. 
[02:41:00]  It's like Wacky Wall Walker.  Yeah, yeah.  Wacky Wall Walker.  Definitely.  You throw it, and it goes ding, ding, ding down the wall.  He was playing tug of war with that thing.  Oh, it was horrendous.  All right.  So what do we want to do now?  We got the guys from the Short Bus Comedy Tour who are here.  All right.  Let's get some more of our guys in here if they want to check out some comedy.  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  That was a good jump.  Look at my sign.  Yeah.  You got a nice sign, Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  There you go.  All right.  Twitchell's on the PalTalk camera jumping up and down.  So why don't we get more people in to check out the comedy?  Where's Nathaniel?  Where's who else wants in here?  We need an audience.  These guys are great guys.  I mean, the whole point of this is we want to spread awareness.  But we're not taking ourselves too seriously.  Uh-oh.  I don't like spreading awareness, Benny.  Yeah, we just want to openly laugh at you.  Mommy will be there in a minute, baby.  Mommy.  He doesn't sound from every age. 
[02:42:00]  Two months to 20 years old.  Yo, Ese.  What up, yo?  What's up?  What's going on?  Who's that guy?  I don't know.  Just nod.  You're home.  Very bad.  Hey.  All right.  So we're going to use that mic.  Move the mic back a little bit.  Twitchell's, why don't you introduce these guys one by one, and they'll come in and try  to do a couple minutes of their act, okay?  Sure, sure.  Who are you going to start with?  We'll start off with a guy, a good friend of mine named Tim Grill, who has spina bifida. 
[02:42:30]  All right, and is he going to do the act first, and then we'll talk to him?  That's terrific.  So, like, bring him on stage.  It's totally up to him.  Yeah, do that.  Do it.  Like, bring him on stage.  Yeah, bring him on stage.  Bring him on stage.  Bring him on stage.  Yeah, leave again.  Leave.  Yeah, get out of the room.  Yeah, leave again, and we'll have him bring you on.  Yeah, turn down the lights a little bit so these guys feel a little bit comfortable.  Yeah, turn the lights down.  A little bit comfortable.  Just a little bit.  The humans will attack first.  All right, here we go.  We will lead it with spina bifida and juggernaut, cerebral, cerebral palsy, and spina bifida. 
[02:43:00]  Twitchels, I'm assuming you're going to be the emcee.  You're going to do some of your act, and then you're going to introduce the other guys,  right?  Yeah.  All right, so give him the big club out intro.  All right, we got Tim Grill coming in here.  He is the...  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  No, no.  Oh, he asked you to do it.  I'm introducing you.  Oh, okay.  So that you can...  Well, calm down, motherfucker.  Gentlemen, welcome to Caroline's on Broadway.  The most important fucking place on Earth. 
[02:43:30]  At the crossroads of the galaxy.  Yeah.  Hey, everybody, put your hands together.  Put your hands together.  Thanks for coming out this evening.  Thank you very much, friend.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for coming out this evening.  Listen, folks, turn your cell phones down and keep your table talk to a minimum.  There's a two-drink minimum.  Other than that, there's no rules.  So tonight, we're going to bring him on stage.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  You know him from making...  ONA!  ONA! 
[02:44:00]  ONA!  The big yellow one is the sun!  ONA rules!  ONA party rocks!  ONA does rule!  ONA does rule!  I hate Patrice!  Yes, a lot of people do.  Everyone...  Not gay.  Show us your web, George!  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  Patrice, the red light's on.  You're going to fucking go over on this, too?  Okay, okay.  Okay.  All right, thanks.  Come on, come on, come on!  Maybe later in the show. 
[02:44:30]  Later in the show.  Where's the glass dildos?  It's raining stuff!  Calm down.  It's raining things.  All right, guys.  Hey, it's cold out here!  Get it?  It's cold out here!  Go on Foundry.  Foundrymusic.com.  You can hear all that stuff.  And you may have known this next guy also from ONA.  ONA!  All right, everyone.  All right.  And, okay, settle down a little bit. 
[02:45:00]  Just keep your yelling down to a minimum.  So this next guy, you've heard him on the ONA show,  and you've also seen him doing funny things  that you don't know what the fuck it is,  and he makes people uncomfortable.  He's a really funny comic.  Please give it up for Twitchels, ladies and gentlemen.  Twitchels.  Yo, what's up, people?  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Welcome to the show here.  Thank you so much for that warm welcoming, Patrice.  I really appreciate it.  All right, we're going to bring up our first comedian. 
[02:45:30]  He is a really funny guy.  They call him the Barely Can...  Jump!  The Barely Can Stand-Up Comedian...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You didn't do a joke.  You should at least do a joke.  No, because every time I try to do a joke,  you guys just rev it apart.  It's so different than being a clown.  Do a joke.  Ah!  Ew!  Boo-boo.  Wow.  Didn't I get my Tourette's out?  It's like Quagmire.  Do one joke, get a laugh,  and then you move on to the next comedian.  But, all right, so I...  You know, everyone asks me,  what does it feel like to have Tourette's Syndrome?  And the other day, I was in the Kmart having Tourette's Syndrome. 
[02:46:00]  This is a true story, actually.  It just does happen.  And this lady walks up to me,  and she's heard me do my grunting tick.  This is the one where I'm like...  Where's Big A?  See, I told you!  Shut up.  Do your joke.  Oh, Joe!  So the lady comes up to me.  She says, I'm sorry, I heard you grunting.  If you need it, there's a water fountain.  This is the Kmart.  This really happened to me.  And I told her...  I said, no, no, it's fine.  I'm opening them up front with people.  I said, I have Tourette's Syndrome.  That's why I'm making those noises.  I swear to God, this lady did this to me.  She looked at me, puts her hand on her heart,  opens her eyes, and says,  Oh, my God!  It says it just like this. 
[02:46:30]  I'm so sorry!  I didn't know you had Tourette's.  I hope I didn't offend you.  I swear to God, this happened two weeks ago.  So I look at her and I say,  It's okay, but please don't talk to me.  Ramon!  Ramon!  Where's Big A?  O&A rule!  See, this is why it doesn't work.  Bringing out our first comedian, folks. 
[02:47:00]  It's called the Barely Can Stand-Up Comedian  because he has spina bifida.  The one and only Tim Grill.  Let's hear it, folks.  Bring him in.  Thank you, thank you.  How's everyone doing?  Great.  Good, man.  11 o'clock in the morning.  Bizarro comedy here.  It's the first time I've ever been introduced by a goat.  You know, right there?  Being with this guy is exhausting.  I swear to God, he's the only guy who gets road rage on a train.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  And that?  I am a disabled guy named Timmy.  I'm cursed with that name.  I know.  Being tiny and being named Tim and having a crutch when I was a kid  got me the lead in a school Christmas play every single year.  I can tell you that much.  You know, I was born with spina bifida.  A lot of people don't know what that is.  It's pronounced spina bifida.  The reason I say this is because I still have family members coming up to me all the time.  They're like, how's that spinal syphilis treating you?  And I got to tell them all the time, my syphilis ain't got nothing to do with the spina bifida. 
[02:48:00]  Thank you so much, really.  This is how they treat us.  Yeah, exactly.  You gotta love it.  I love it.  I think it's funny.  He's fucking genius.  All right, a little more.  A lot of times when a girl asks me what spina bifida is, I tell her, I'm honest,  I say spina bifida is a condition that gave me a giant penis, which is the reason I walk 
[02:48:30]  the way I do.  That's why I walk the way I fucking do.  I got spina bifida.  It gave me a fat cock, you whore.  Who said it was curable?  Didn't you say last week you thought it was curable?  I believed that, am I heckling right now?  I believe from the limited knowledge I have of spina bifida is that if a baby comes out  with spina bifida, they can correct it.  They're doing, do you mind, man? 
[02:49:00]  Listen to this.  This is all the way up on a train up here.  Two hours.  They're doing surgery in utero, so they are trying to fix it, but it's not curable.  No?  No.  What is, what after they?  1970 was definitely not curable.  Oh, well, I didn't think that.  Not in 1970.  Yeah.  There was still a lot.  The reason we're doing this to the short bus is, you know, I can speak for me.  I understand, but in 1970.  Black people always complain that they hit a ride on the back of the bus, but you know  what, at least you guys got the ride on a normal bus.  Oh, no.  Are we still having an entirely different bus this day, man?  The little short yellow bus. 
[02:49:30]  It's funny because it's true.  I want to shout.  I want to protest.  I want to shout.  Let my people go.  My problem is, as soon as you let my people go, most of us hit the pavement, you see,  so we can't do that.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Tim Grill.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Tim Grill.  I want to know a little bit more, though.  Yeah, now I got to know about you.  You said 1970.  1970.  You come out and you have what amounts to a big pomegranate on your back, I guess. 
[02:50:00]  Well, it's a hole in the spine.  It's a hole.  Yeah, it's a hole.  I had major spine surgery in 10 hours or whatever after I was born, and they close it up.  And I have a pretty mild case of it.  There's kids out there that have just really bad wheelchairs, bedridden, some of them.  So I actually got lucky, if you can believe that.  But now?  I mean, kids born now with it?  I don't know.  You know, I haven't followed up on what...  Geez.  Really nice throwing yourself into the problem.  Well, no, no, no. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, I haven't...  I've seen stories where they're doing surgery in utero, but I don't know how well it's going.  Where is that?  Near Denmark, I believe?  Is that the only place you can...  In utero?  Yeah.  I believe it's Czechoslovakia.  Awesome.  The windmills.  I've heard that.  Yeah, it's right there in the windmills.  It's wonderful.  Tulips.  Yeah.  But you...  Yeah, because you seem kind of...  You know, you got a little limp, but that's fine.  Any other problems that...  Besides the limp, that kind of hidden problems that you've got to deal with on a basic day?  Yeah, you know, I've had problems with my kidneys and stuff like that.  Really?  It'll do things like that? 
[02:51:00]  I don't know if that's the...  You know, if that's...  I mean, I suppose it is, but, you know, I've had 13 surgeries.  Just because there's a hole...  There was a hole...  Messes up everything else within...  In your back?  Does it go right through to, like, your back?  What, to my front?  No.  No, I mean, I...  Yeah, right through to your front.  I mean, it's...  Completely through me.  It's your back, and then your spine is involved?  Yes.  And he also...  What about your spinal cord?  If your spine is exposed, then...  You know, yeah.  What about your spinal cord, though?  Like, wouldn't that dry out if it's just kind of hanging out in the breeze like that? 
[02:51:30]  Well, I don't think they hang you at a window for any length of time.  They kind of, you know, seal it right up.  I think they kind of work on you right away.  There you go.  He also has mullet-osis.  Mullet-osis.  Mullet-osis.  The only one that can stop mullet-osis is Colossus.  Colossus.  We raised Cyrus-osis.  Use your bifida beam to kill the mutants.  Did you want me to bring the other guys in, too, now?  Yeah, yeah, man.  Let's move on to the next thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you very much. 
[02:52:00]  Very informative.  The next guy coming in is a very, very funny comedian in the New York scene, Mike Catello.  He has cerebral, cerebral, whatever, Palsy.  Whatever it's called.  Whatever it's called, Palsy.  Mike Catello, people.  There he is.  Hey.  How you doing, Mike?  All right.  So, you know, people always stare at me on the street like there's something wrong with  me.  Like, at any minute, they think I'm going to walk up to them and say something like, I  like milk thuds. 
[02:52:30]  They are delicious, though.  I dress myself.  I look pretty.  Where's my helmet?  But you guys, I don't wear a helmet.  Come on.  That's just retarded.  I did that joke for my mother once, and afterwards, she looked at me all sad and serious, and she  goes, oh, do you remember that?  Apparently, I had to wear a fucking helmet.  I thought I was a little joke. 
[02:53:00]  No, haha, joke's on me.  That's all right.  That's funny.  Those are bonus points.  That's very funny, man.  That's hilarious.  That's why we hired him.  Jump.  We're fucking with each other.  This is awesome.  Who's the headliner?  Oh, you should see what the tour looks like.  Oh, the headliner is round boy Jimmy Graham.  He's actually in the new movie coming out in September with Mark Wahlberg.  Oh, the guy outside is the headliner.  Yeah.  So this is the order of the show.  Yeah.  This is basically the order of the show.  I'm going to have to do it. 
[02:53:30]  I'd love to do another joke or two.  Then we'll get to a couple more.  Round boy.  Huh?  More jokes?  Yeah.  Whatever you got.  You're doing good, man.  You're killing.  In a room of five people.  Awesome.  Like last night.  Hey.  So, you know, I haven't really been on a date in a while because dating's hard for me.  I never know if they like me for me or they're just in it for the parking spaces.  Because they're good fucking spaces.  Come on.  You need to run an errand. 
[02:54:00]  I'm your man.  Thanks, Patrice.  I like it.  You know what's funny about him?  He is a tag.  He has tag like the, all right, folks, and nice talking to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice talking to you.  Take good spaces.  Come on, folks.  Come on, folks.  Take good spaces.  That's great.  I used to be a social worker.  That's what I did for like five years.  And it was a pretty cool job.  Every once in a while, I'd get to help a person get over their feelings of suicide.  And I felt really good about myself. 
[02:54:30]  Till like the fourth or fifth time it happened.  Then I was like, dude, just do it.  Really, it's not worth it.  You're stressing me out.  Come on, I can help.  We'll take you down to the subway.  Look at the way I walk.  I'll say I tripped.  No big deal.  Your mother said she'd help.  Come on, let's go.  This nigga's funny.  I'm telling you.  He doesn't deserve fucking whatever he has.  I don't.  You're right.  I'm cheating.  Tell the guy who deserves what he got. 
[02:55:00]  Come use your bifida bean to take other people's fucking afflictions.  Now, he has cerebral palsy.  Right.  Cerebral.  Cerebral.  Is that how you say it?  Cerebral?  Is it cerebral?  This guy doesn't deserve that.  Cerebrum.  He doesn't deserve that.  Cerebrum.  He just goes on the fuck's up.  There was a guy last night.  He needs something else because he's pretty good.  He's fucking funny, actually.  He got passed.  I've had cerebral palsy, and he was much more fucked up than this guy.  Yeah, but not as funny.  Yeah.  But not as funny.  Not as funny. 
[02:55:30]  Not as funny at all.  The helmet joke, dude.  Thank God.  I thought you were going to say he was much more funny than this guy.  No.  No.  No.  Well, that's Mike Catoia.  Mike Catoia.  It's funnymanmike.com.  And he looks like fucking a pin.  A young.  What's the pin that passed away?  Chris Penn.  Chris Penn.  Really?  Chris Penn.  Young something.  My dad told me Tom Cruise.  Dude, all white people look alike to you.  That guy looks nothing like Chris.  Who's he look like?  And somebody, it's somebody he looks like.  Look at him. 
[02:56:00]  He just said it.  Look at the left hand.  He just said it.  His father says what?  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise?  I've gotten that a lot.  Really?  Nigga, Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  In half of Vanilla Sky.  Should we bring out our next guy, the headliner?  No, man.  We want more.  Let's bring out our next comic. 
[02:56:30]  Do you want to talk to the comedian about the interview process now?  No.  No.  All right.  All right.  We'll move on to round four.  Headliner.  Now, this is a really funny guy.  He used to be my wrestling coach, and we didn't know it until we met about a year and a half  ago when I started doing comedy.  Is this guy a gym teacher?  Actually, he's a special ed teacher.  No, he's coached wrestling, and he also is a teacher in the school doing special ed.  Was he a gym teacher?  I don't know if he's ever a gym teacher.  He looks like a gym teacher.  Did he touch you in your uh-oh?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was the playback of the ring. 
[02:57:00]  Yes.  All right.  You'll see him in the new film, Invincible, starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear.  He co-stars in that.  Coming out in September by Disney is the round boy of comedy.  I'm in a wiser hanging with you guys.  Oh, give me a break.  Round boy Jimmy Graham.  Yeah.  Woo.  Round boy.  What's up, boys?  What's up, round boy?  What's up, man?  We got round boys in the house.  What's up, round boys? 
[02:57:30]  All right, yeah.  What's up, round boys?  Round boys rule, baby.  Round boys rule.  Once you go rounds, you never come down.  That's all there is still.  Oh.  That's right, man.  Got a little catchphrase.  Rousey, you had the stapling job, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah.  That's cool.  I couldn't afford that shit.  You're a quitter.  Don't be a quitter.  Come on, man.  No, really, I couldn't afford that shit.  So I got the second one.  That's where they stapled my hands to my thighs.  It was rough.  KFC was pissed.  They fired half the staff. 
[02:58:00]  It's all about how you feel about yourself, people.  Look around at my people surrounding me.  All right, there ain't enough of them to surround me.  But honestly, they're here.  You know, and it's, look, they get picked on all the time.  I got picked on as a kid, too.  It's about how you look.  You know, how about you feel.  It's not about how you look.  It's how you feel.  But there is some shit out there that's very strange.  Have you seen the new things with the young girls?  They're walking around with the shorts with the little shit right on their heinies.  I like that.  I did.  I saw this girl walking around.  She had it on the back of her ass that said, juicy.  Juicy ass.  You really want to deal with juicy ass? 
[02:58:30]  I thought at first it was a warning.  Like, stay back five feet, juicy ass.  Beep, beep.  No, man.  Juicy ass is what you get when you come home from Mexico.  You don't want to deal with that shit.  Honey, it's still a little moist.  Stick it out the window.  The cat just ran out the room, all right?  Yeah, baby.  I was shopping around Christmas time.  I was in the mall.  I'm walking around.  This chick's got a pair of sweatpants on.  On the back of it, it says, bitch.  I'm like, yo, bitch.  You got my wife's pants.  She's going to want them back, all right?  The best one was down the shore, man. 
[02:59:00]  I'm on the boardwalk, and I see a chick with a giant ass walking down.  But that's all right with the round boy.  But across the back of her shorts, she had written the word anal.  I know.  That's what I thought.  Like, anal.  Talk about advertising.  When I looked at it closer, she didn't even spell it right.  It was spelled A-N-E-L.  And that's when it hit me, people.  It didn't say anal.  It said angel.  Yeah.  Oh, the G.  Their ass.  There you go.  Well, you got to think about that.  That's a joke you got to think about. 
[02:59:30]  That's a thinking man's joke.  Tony, Tony.  The G was up her fucking ass, man.  Up her fucking ass.  You didn't get the fucking joke, you fucking idiot.  I didn't know.  The short-blast comedy tour, people.  There you go.  Short-blast comedy.  Got to hand it to all these guys.  It's a tough room, man.  To just walk in and try to do a couple jokes.  Now, how long does the show last?  Like, fucking 32, 33 seconds?  We're doing an hour and a half show, and it kicks off at 9 p.m. 
[03:00:00]  April 13th.  Hour and a half show.  It's going to feel like three hours.  That means 20 minutes of comedy, and the rest of the time is waiting for them to get on the stage.  The laugh factory now has a ramp installed.  And you're the host?  You're hosting it?  Yeah, I'm hosting it.  Now, that's going to be our official short-blast comedy show, but Jimmy and I and Tim, actually, all four of us, we'll be doing, I guess, just a run-through show.  We'll be doing two shows coming up, March 18th in Philadelphia at the Comedy Cabaret, then March 25th in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. 
[03:00:30]  Jesus Christ.  So, that's going to be, like, us getting the feel.  Yeah, I know.  He's amazing.  All right, let's get the plugs out for the websites.  Laughterbyloo.com.  You can get all the information on our schedule.  And the ringtones.  Ringtones are coming out.  Same thing.  Roundboy, you got a website?  Yeah, jimmygram.net.  Just like the cracker.  And then Mike has a website, funnymanmike.com.  And what about Tim?  Timgrill.com.  Timgrill.com.  Thank you so much for having us here. 
[03:01:00]  Thank you.  Thank you so much for having us.  Great rating room.  Thank you.  We will continue.  Congratulations.  You guys have been here.  In studio, Ralphie May today.  Hey, kids.  Playing Bananas this weekend.  Yes, sir.  Starting tonight?  No, Friday.  And Hasbrook Heights or?  Poughkeepsie on Friday and Hasbrook Heights on Saturday.  Got a phone number?  None.  Zero.  I stink.  And, of course, Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:01:30]  And there was some controversy going on during the commercial break, Anthony.  Well, Opie, during the break, the Pal Talk people are privy to our conversations in here.  We go to a break.  The show never ends.  The show never ends.  For the Pal Talkers.  The Pal Talkers can hear what we're talking about.  We can see them.  They can see us.  And they hear our discussions.  And sometimes we discuss perhaps what we will talk about during the next segment of the show.  That's how this show works.  So we started talking about the Pope, and the Pope has an iPod. 
[03:02:00]  And that's in the paper.  That made the news.  And then we're speculating as to if he really does, what's on it, things like that.  And then it turns out that the New York Post decided to do a funny, clever little thing.  What could be on the Pope's iPod?  And I'm sure it's hysterical, like every bit of comedy that the New York Post tries.  A lot of gangster rap.  Yeah, I'm sure.  A lot of gangster rap.  Well, during that little conversation we were having, somebody on Pal Talk just writes,  Pope equals boring. 
[03:02:30]  He is, as we're talking about doing the bit, we're not even sure we're going to do it.  We're not sure we're doing it.  We're not sure how it's going to go.  We weren't doing the bit.  We were discussing whether we should even, like, touch on it.  He decided it was boring.  And that we should maybe think about doing something else.  And that, oh boy.  His name, killed at birth.  Killed at birth.  And I already have him set up.  He's changing his name right now.  I have his name up there on the, you think it's the bounce list? 
[03:03:00]  No, my friend.  It is the ban list.  Jeez.  When you're bounced from the room, you can come back in 24 hours later.  This guy knew that he was in trouble and he got out of that room.  And he's now in another room.  And Anthony's just chasing him in cyberspace with a fucking gun.  And with a World War II rifle.  There we go.  Banned.  When you're bounced, you can get back in 24 hours later.  When you're banned, you must beg me to take you off the ban list. 
[03:03:30]  I've had people write it to my MySpace account and go,  Anthony, please, I bought PalTalk just for your show.  You banned me because I IM'd you.  I wasn't sure of the rules.  I'm not, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to IM you.  That's a big rule because, and here's why.  Sometimes girls are putting on shows on this thing.  Yeah.  And a girl is ready to stick a dildo up her ass.  And, bing, the picture's covered with, hi, what's up?  Ugh.  And, oh, instantly, instantly banned. 
[03:04:00]  So, people know not to IM me.  How do I get, how do you, because I got banned from a couple of spots already.  How do you get unbanned?  How do you go, please?  Wait, why didn't you get banned?  Because I know you're going to the real dirty sites, man.  What are you doing to get banned in big, fat, black bitch takes it up the ass?  Oh, come on, big, black bitch, let me in.  I told you that there was a skinny girl on, you know.  She was typing and wrote, you know, hey, why are you in the big black bitch's room, girl?  You're too skinny.  She goes, I like the music.  Oh, yeah, fat bitches do have great music. 
[03:04:30]  Bing!  God.  And how do I get in touch with the head of the fat black bitch room?  All of a sudden, you're just sitting there, and all your cameras freeze that you're watching.  You go, hey, what's the problem?  All my cameras are up there.  And then the little prompt, you have been bounced from the room.  Hey, hi, fat bitches.  There's, hello, there's only 21 people in your room.  Can I watch you fat hoes for a minute?  And they kicked you out.  You can either get it.  You can either, see, it's easy for us. 
[03:05:00]  They can just go to my MySpace or something like that and write, you know, hey, I fucked up.  Can I get back on?  How do you get back in?  You're the king of pal talk, nigga.  How do I find the fat bitch that got me out of there?  I don't know.  You either got to go under another name or account, get into that room, and then plead your case  to the head muckety muck of the room.  If I go back in there and there's another name, I'm going to go, it's me again, you fat bitch.  And I'll just keep coming back as another name.  Bing.  Goodbye.  Bing.  Good day, sir.  I said good day.  This Pope thing could be something because it's the Pope. 
[03:05:30]  No, it can't, Toby.  It's the New York Post trying to be funny, though, with their writing.  Uh-huh.  Pope grooves with new iPod.  Guess you could call him the iPope.  Ah, come on, see the iPope.  Because it's the I and then P-O.  And then the joke falls apart.  Pope Benedict has an iPod loaded with his favorite tunes.  No, he doesn't.  The pencil-thin, ultra-trendy iPod Nano in papal white instead of demonic black, the other 
[03:06:00]  color comes in.  Of course, was presented to His Holiness by Vatican Radio staffers.  This is a Vatican radio station?  Pumping out all the hits.  Don't bash them.  K-Tel Records and Tapes presents the best of the Pope.  Um, track one.  Boom, boom, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Traffic is really rough out there.  You remember such hits as...  The clouds farted down upon the traffic and it was divided. 
[03:06:30]  You remember such hits as pigeons flying.  Ooh, doves.  Bells ringing.  Enchanting.  With bonus track, Tuber LaBelle's from The Exorcist.  Well, you guys want to guess what's in the iPod because they loaded it up with some samples.  Sampling of the station's programming in English, Italian, and German.  Stairway to Heaven.  It also contains digital downloads of religious music and compositions by Beethoven, Mozart, 
[03:07:00]  Chopin.  Yeah, all the big Germans because he's a Nazi.  Yeah.  And Stravinsky.  He loves all the Nazis.  Where's his Wagner hits?  A few Hitler speeches on there.  Let me...  Big Heil!  What's this under this, uh, track, uh, 18?  First one, Christian, Jordan!  Probably the second one, Christian!  Uh, Pope, what?  You might want to delete that of your iTunes.  A picture.  A doctored picture of Jesse Owens losing in the 32 Olympics. 
[03:07:30]  Ha!  You want to hear how out of touch the Pope is?  And except in the two gigabyte gadget, the pontiff noted that computer technology is the future.  Oh, wow.  You're really...  Ooh, going out on a limb there.  That's a statement from 52.  With computer technology, as I show you the Univac computer, it takes up an entire room.  That should have been the end of War Games, at the end, the quote from the Pope. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, sure.  Shall we play a game?  Shall we play a song?  Computers are the future.  What an ass.  And he apparently wants to be part of that future.  Rather than stick the gift in a drawer, the Pope's been spotted around the Vatican wearing  Apple's trademark white earphones.  He's walking around with his iPod.  With his earbuds in.  Get the hell out of here.  No, he's not.  I cannot imagine it.  With an inside pimp cell phone pocket on his fucking robe. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, playing some 50 Cent when it rings.  He's got his ringtones.  Next, he's going to get pal-talked.  Tired out here for so.  Did you see the Pope on pal-talking?  I'm bouncing him for being dirty to the girls begging for tits.  He is very pleased with the iPod, said a Vatican spokesman, adding that he likes to unwind  listening to it.  How much does the Pope have to unwind?  He's unwound.  He's the Pope.  He's the Pope.  He's a sinner of tranquility.  It's not known what, if anything, he's personally uploaded to his playlist. 
[03:09:00]  His nano has a 500-song capacity, so there's plenty of room.  If he's interested, the Post has some contemporary suggestions.  All right, strap in.  Now, everyone, put on the laughing hat, because this is going to be hilarious.  Did you guys see this article?  No.  All right, why don't you try to guess one of the songs that will be in the Pope's icon.  That's it, Stairway to Heaven.  Stairway.  Stairway to Heaven.  Stairway to Heaven.  Stairway.  Oh, wouldn't be a morning show without a wacky bell. 
[03:09:30]  The Post has suggested that he upload, yes, Stairway to Heaven.  What else?  Oh, these are their suggestions.  Yeah.  Because they're so cute and funny.  Women eat my wings?  No.  No.  Yeah.  The boys are back in town?  No.  Radar love?  No.  No, nothing like that, huh?  Hmm.  Anyone?  Damn.  I think that guy was right.  Can't think?  All right, here we go.  This is the Post and their Contemporary Suggestions. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  The Monkees, I'm a Believer.  Oh, because he's a Pope and he believes in that.  When I saw her face, now I'm a believer.  It's Joe Cocker Guy from American Idol singing, I'm a Believer.  I'm a Believer.  He's going to sing them all.  Dionne Warwick, I Say a Little Prayer.  I say a little prayer for you. 
[03:10:30]  Zeppelin, Stairway to Heaven.  Coldplay, God, put a smile on your face.  George Harrison, my sweet Lord.  Jesus, take the wheel.  Queen.  Queen, the miracle.  I don't think he would have any queen.  I don't think any queen is going to be on that.  He doesn't want to acknowledge that queen.  Bob Marley and the Wailers, Redemption Song, Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary, Billie Holiday,  God Bless the Child, The Beatles, Lady Madonna, and the Doobie Bros, Jesus is just all right. 
[03:11:00]  And you just know they had 65 interns just research God and Jesus songs.  Not a laugh to be had in that list.  Oh, nothing.  Awful.  Maybe I should unban the fucking guy.  Let him back in.  He was right.  Let's go to Sean in Iowa.  Hey, figure they have George Michael.  Gotta have faith for him. 
[03:11:30]  Another?  Car crash?  Got it.  These guys want us to do the hacky radio bit that I bet every morning show in America is doing today.  Guess what songs are in the Pope's iPod ever about it?  Let's say hi to Jason in Arizona.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  By the way, I'm removing killed at birth span.  There we go.  There were a couple of laughs in there.  Yeah.  Jason.  Yeah.  Um, I wonder if he's got some Kanye West on their, uh, Jesus Walks. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  This shit is, it's just like.  Dude, this is, where's the bit, though, that every radio station will do?  Jesus Walks.  Every morning show in America is doing this bit today.  And I heard this bit on, uh, Goomba Johnny and the other guy.  Did you really?  Yeah, I did.  But they're taking it serious, right?  Right.  And then probably someone called and said, how about sympathy for the devil?  Ah, see, because it's a Pope. 
[03:12:30]  But he wasn't going to have that.  I just, I just, from yesterday's show with the boss.  Yeah.  I, I moved up boss to my number one.  I moved dad number three on my, my space.  Yeah.  Boss killed yesterday.  And he called everyone.  He called everyone to, to tell him too.  Yeah.  He let everyone know.  He told me over dinner.  He said I was, I was hilarious.  Oh, but when he said that, he, he fucking put, uh, he said move into the girl's uterus  because it's empty.  Oh, I know.  That was a great line.  That was great.  That's what he quoted to me.  Brutal.  Thank you.  Good night. 
[03:13:00]  That was his closer.  Oof.  Damn boss.  I hate when he kills on this show.  Bastard.  Let's see, uh, personal Jesus, Iron Man by Sabbath, long time by Boston, Jesus take  the wheel.  Oh, this is all, we're not doing this bit.  Jesus take the wheel.  Ew, Taylor.  Oh, he's out of here.  I want my $20 tomorrow, motherfucker.  Jesus Christ.  Superstar.  Yeah, we got a bet, my man. 
[03:13:30]  Remember that.  Of course.  On American Idol.  American Idol bet.  Oh, the little skinny dude is not going to go.  I don't think they're going to throw out the little fucking Tweety Bird looking guy.  I'm not going to do it.  It's still going to happen.  No, sir.  I'm collecting money.  The black guy with the teeth.  As soon as that Rage Against the Machine music starts tomorrow, I want you boys to  hand over your 20s.  All right.  Likewise, I'm sure.  What else are we talking about today?  Britney Spears supposedly is pregnant again.  Even more white trash.  She's white trash, man.  Than she could ever be.  She's out white trashing.  Where's her tube top?  Regular white trash. 
[03:14:00]  I find her to be fucking really sexy right now.  Of course you do.  I just.  She's got another bun in the oven.  Just a pig.  Look at that fat fucking ass and how.  Just what a ragged old soggy milky tits.  She was at like the hottest peak of her career as being hot and stuff.  And then she just fatted herself up with a baby.  How many kids with a guy that doesn't give a shit about her?  No.  It's amazing.  Isn't that awesome?  That's white trash, man.  That's beautiful.  All the way, right?  She rad. 
[03:14:30]  Awesome.  You see how guys.  You see how.  This is what I'm saying.  You see how men can influence a woman to do anything.  Bobby Brown cracked up.  One of the all time great singers of our age.  She was.  Did you see the latest video of Whitney Houston coming back from the Olympics?  I didn't hear that fucking thing.  I heard she was horrendous.  You see where a woman will follow a man to?  Hell.  Yeah.  Hell.  That's exactly where she went.  And you see when she's following this fucking gypsy.  She's fucking.  Britney Spears.  This guy's a gypsy.  And they don't fuck anybody.  He got a black girl pregnant. 
[03:15:00]  He's going to get a Puerto Rican girl pregnant.  Britney is now going to be in a trailer park.  Yep.  She's a fucking mess.  And she's in this.  She's from Louisiana.  I mean, it's not like she's like going a whole different route than what she was destined  to go to.  That's true.  She is sticking.  She's staying loyal to her upbringing.  She didn't change her.  Yeah.  She had a beat for a minute.  She was the little diva with.  What's the other one?  Aguilera.  Yeah.  Who is also on the road to destruction because she can't help it either.  Oh, her fucking boyfriend is just.  You can see.  I think she's married now, actually. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I think she got married.  Right, dude.  So she'll be pregnant now.  Oh, look at her.  Just.  And that gut.  And she puts a big belly button ring in there like people want to see it.  Look at those jeans.  Look at that fat ass.  Oh, you don't like.  Titties are sagging.  Oh, just.  Can you imagine just teabagging Britney right now?  Probably got a good chance of doing it.  Yes.  And I can imagine the $5 it'd take to do so.  Yeah.  And she's five bucks.  Five bucks teabag.  And she's so.  Oops, I did it again.  She got five billion in the bank and she'll put the five in there in her bank account. 
[03:16:00]  Now I got five billion and five.  Hey.  Hey, remember.  Tiffany was big at one point.  You know.  Remember Tiffany?  Tiffany.  Yeah.  And she.  That was a career.  She was.  She was big at one point.  And where'd she end up?  Naked and Playboy.  Passed when anyone wanted to see her naked.  Yep.  That's what Britney's going to do.  Snowboarding with the celebrities.  She'll be on that soon.  She could at least throw in us a bone and pose for Playboy before she went down the old 
[03:16:30]  motherhood route.  Oh, Britney.  Yeah.  She's just a hog and I love her.  She should.  Women should do that.  Get pictures.  And you notice these.  They do that sometimes.  They freeze their eggs.  So later on they could have kids when they're maybe older or something.  She's not committed.  She's not committed to show business.  Take nude pictures of yourself before the kids.  She's made all her money.  She's not committed.  Because a bitch like Angelina Jolie, she's pregnant.  But that bitch don't feed that baby.  That motherfucking baby is going to come out.  It's going to be one pound, one ounce.  Because she picked up smoking. 
[03:17:00]  Gwyneth Paltrow still has those pigeon arms.  All the Kate Holmes with the herpes.  She pigeon arms.  This bitch is a mama.  She's a childbearing body.  It's built for childbearing.  That's it.  There's going to be dirty diapers in her mansion.  Fuck it.  Angelina Jolie is going to see what's the least amount of time the baby has to spend in her  womb and live.  Like, Doc, is there a chance like three months you could take it out and the machines can do 
[03:17:30]  the rest because I really don't want much of a paunch here.  Mr. and Ms. Smith, too, coming up.  Like, yeah, I'm going to be busy.  She'll be at labor for four seconds.  That baby will pop out like a fucking balloon that they let the air out of.  That baby is going to come out the pussy like.  All right.  Catch it by the ass, please.  This fucking...  Angelina, don't give a shit about the pregnancy.  You can see Britney doesn't care about show business.  Show business is big.  To Angelina and Gwyneth, show business is big. 
[03:18:00]  Julia Roberts, you go, when was this bitch pregnant?  I don't know, but my girl got a baby.  She's still trying to get rid of the fucking lasagna that she got.  She's still 85 crunches an hour to give her the lasagna and it ain't going nowhere.  And these women, yeah.  These stars, they snap right back.  She's at home crunching away as you do the radio show, man.  You'll see a picture of a celebrity, like, yeah, Julia Roberts or something, a little pregnant. 
[03:18:30]  And then the next picture is her with washboard abs pushing a stroller.  Yeah, she's got like six kids all of a sudden.  Yeah, she's got a bunch of kids.  She's got washboard abs and...  Supposedly she's fine.  They induce at eight months because the last month is where they get the...  That's where the damage.  The lasagna is.  The damage and they gain a lot of weight.  And they induce at eight months.  You hear the rumor about Katie Holmes?  That's all over Hollywood.  Engaged to a gay guy, herpes, what?  No one's willing to...  Jesus, which one? 
[03:19:00]  I heard a bunch of them.  No one's willing to go with the story, but supposedly she's not pregnant at all and she's just wearing a thing.  Stop it.  And it's going to come out that, you know...  They're going to adopt something?  Or...  How long do you keep that a joke?  There's got to be an end plan.  Like a miscarriage or something stupid.  Or some kind of miscarriage is going to happen.  It's too late for a miscarriage.  It's too late.  I'm telling you, that is like a serious rumor that's going on around in Hollywood, but no one's willing to go with it.  They got to adopt it.  And supposedly there's a website...  Where's the rumor going around?  No, there's a website.  Maybe someone can help me in the office.  Then they have to go somewhere and adopt it. 
[03:19:30]  They got pictures of the apparatus.  No way.  Or what looks like it could be an apparatus under her clothes.  It might be one of those Scientology raps or something.  Who knows what the hell they put around these bitches.  Those people are nuts.  Constantly like letting L. Ron Hubbard recordings go into her room.  They're very suspicious about that.  Have you gotten big enough in Hollywood where you got approached?  Have you got approached by them people?  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  When I was out there, before Last Comic, I would dig acting classes over there because  they're good acting classes, but they're only like $6 and then they try to induct you. 
[03:20:00]  But since then, I've been approached several times.  How did they come up to you?  How did they do that?  They were like, one time I was in the green room at the Wayne Brady show and one of them,  I forget which one it was, it's one of the big ones, was doing Wayne Brady and he goes,  so how's your career going?  It's wonderful.  Really?  Do you go to church?  Are you religious?  I go, no, no, not really.  I remember the church was happening now.  I'm down for weed, food, I'm cool with all that shit. 
[03:20:30]  Well, have you ever thought about the church of Scientology?  Oops.  Oh, boy.  And it got real creepy real quick.  It was like the room went dark a little bit.  Little L. Ron Hubbard.  Did you hear Jamie Foxx's story with Tom Cruise?  No.  The one when they did...  Collateral?  Collateral.  And Tom Cruise is trying to get him to join and Jamie's trying to be hot, you know, like  get along.  You can't just go, get out of here with your goofy, crazy shit.  We don't play that shit up in the hood, motherfucker, because it is Tom Cruise, you know? 
[03:21:00]  Right.  So, but Tom Cruise, I heard, I guess I have to say all allegedly, he sent a check in Jamie  Foxx's name to the Church of Jesus Christ, the Scientology, yeah.  Wow.  And Jamie Foxx was like, dude, that was the falling out that they had, like, look, I don't  mind you doing what you're doing, but don't fucking...  Don't bring me into this.  It ain't like that.  Tom Cruise wants to bring them all in.  He does.  Cursed out Brooke Shields.  I mean, about the depression and medication. 
[03:21:30]  You know, he doesn't believe in psychology and things like that.  Yeah, it's all pseudoscience and all that shit.  So, yeah, so he's just, he is like so deep into it, and you can tell any word that comes  out of his mouth that isn't written on a script to a movie, he's crazy.  Yeah, he's nuts, man.  Yeah?  That guy is nuts.  And I'd follow it.  That's why he hasn't got an Oscar.  I would follow it if once they did something that was worth...  Everything they do stinks.  I read Dianetics back when they used to say L. Ron Hubbard.  L. Ron Hubbard. 
[03:22:00]  I didn't know it was a science, like a fucking religion.  Dianetics.  And Battlefield Earth.  It's kind of like a self-help book or something.  Did you see Battlefield Earth?  Oh.  The movie that was dedicated was the worst movie ever.  Dude, that's supposed to be what the religion's all about.  Yeah.  That's supposed to be what happened.  That's like a historical fuck.  Like, you watch something like Our Religion with, you know, the Ten Commandments, watching  fucking Hesitin.  I bring to thee these Ten Commandments.  That's their fucking Ten Commandments. 
[03:22:30]  Fucking spaceships and movies and aliens.  And gold.  Yeah.  And John Javals and giant boots.  That's their fucking shit.  Star Wars.  Is their religion.  They're nuts, dude.  They're nuts.  The movie was ridiculous.  I dated a girl before my wife.  A girl named, I'm not going to say her name, but she got into that stuff and she's just  gone.  Yeah.  She tried to, she was like, I was dated all above my level, like way, way above.  I don't know how I did it either.  And, um.  You didn't even let us say that line. 
[03:23:00]  Jesus.  I don't have to.  I'm saying this for you.  You know what it is, Phil?  What's their principles, though?  Their principle is that in every one of us, there are these bad things.  These, uh, uh, bad energy.  Well, there's like, they're like the little nanos or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bad energy that was left because, um, we were here, uh, many, many years ago and  an alien race came over here and, uh, uh, blew up the planet with atomic bombs and killed 
[03:23:30]  everybody.  But the, the particular matter is evilness and it's in all of us still.  And in order to cleanse the body, you have to go through these different phases of Scientology.  Yeah, and it's like, like, to get to these different levels, you have to, like, give  money.  Oh, it's huge amounts of money.  Yeah.  And then you hold on to these wacky contraptions, like tin cans and wires and blinking lights,  and that clears your, uh, your spirit of these, uh.  What's all the rumors about, uh, like, all the stuff for, like, uh, Travolta's and all 
[03:24:00]  this weird sex and he's got a retarded kid or something to keep it on a cage or something?  Yeah, that's all the rumors.  I didn't do that.  Like, like, they have these sex parties and they have, uh.  Wow.  Travolta, what they did, Ralphie's gonna be on a plane and Travolta's gonna go, this is  your captain speaking.  Hey.  What's up?  Yeah, this is Dr. Travolta.  Heard what you said about me on the Opie and Anthony show.  We have, uh, six parties with Double J in the back of the car on the Verrazano Bridge.  Now you're a cunt.  All right, we gotta get out of here.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Awesome.
