<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Mark Maron guest-hosting a "worst of" segment featuring listener-requested clips.  The majority of this segment focused on a rapper calling himself "Gangsta Fag," whose songs contained graphic depictions of violent and degrading homosexual sex acts, using homophobic and racial slurs. The hosts and Maron reacted with a mixture of shock, amusement, and analysis, discussing the rapper's motivations and the listener reactions, speculating on whether "Gangsta Fag" was a real person or a persona.  The segment also included listener calls expressing outrage and amusement.  Comparisons were drawn between "Gangsta Fag" and other rappers and celebrities, including a fictionalized, gay Andrew Dice Clay.

Next, the show featured a phone interview with Sylvester Stallone, discussing his career, including *Rocky Balboa*, *Rambo*, and *Cop Land*.  Stallone detailed studio opposition to *Rocky Balboa*, his physical preparation for *Rambo*, and the challenges of balancing artistic integrity with commercial success. This was interspersed with segments featuring a homeless guitarist, "Papa Rock" or "Homeless Guitar Dude," whose erratic behavior, equipment malfunctions, and use of racial slurs and misogynistic language provided comedic, albeit uncomfortable, moments.  The hosts attempted to help him, but his performance was repeatedly disrupted, leading to exasperation and amusement. The possibility of his inclusion in a "homeless shopping spree" was discussed.

The show continued with a segment featuring a man with a broken guitar.  Greg Hughes, who plays Opie on the show, was also present. The hosts engaged in a highly vulgar conversation with the man, making crude jokes about his guitar, homelessness, and masturbation habits.  Despite this, they gave him a new guitar, which he played terribly, leading to more vulgar jokes and banter. This was followed by an interview with Oderous Urungus of GWAR, focusing on Oderous's stage persona (including his prosthetic penis), graphic sexual discussions, and numerous offensive jokes. Studio interns were encouraged to interact physically with Oderous's prosthetic. The interview covered GWAR's history, Oderous's political views, and anecdotes from his time with the band.  

Later, the show included a phone call from Dave Brockie, GWAR's creator, discussing his career and negative experiences with record labels. This transitioned into more listener-requested bits. One featured a hypnotized Ron and Fez crew imitating the Opie and Anthony Show with crude language and sexual innuendo, including a guest called Dr. Z. Another involved a caller's account of a suspicious death on a cruise ship, leading to a discussion about finding bodies at sea and speculation about foul play. A final request played audio from a *Wizard of Oz* production by individuals with mental disabilities, sparking a discussion about the appropriateness of joking about people with disabilities.  The hosts acknowledged the controversial nature of several segments.

The show concluded with another segment featuring audio from a children's *Wizard of Oz* rehearsal, focusing on the comedically inept performances of child actors, particularly those with disabilities. Opie, Anthony, Bill Burr, and Nick Swartzen (in studio) reacted with irreverent and offensive commentary. The audio included the repeated flubbing of lines, the struggles of a wheelchair-bound Tin Man, and listener calls, including one whose girlfriend was upset by the show's depiction of children with disabilities.  The segment continued with more irreverent commentary and advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Um, normally, these two tools decide what you'll be hearing on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Sam.  And this is E-Rod.  Yeah.  Yeah, kids.  However, you've called, emailed, tweeted, said back, and screamed that you could do a much better job of selecting bits than they can.  So now, not so much as a thank you for years of faithful support, but more to stifle your bitching and complaining. 
[00:00:30]  We're giving you the opportunity to pick your favorite moments from the show.  I need to hear.  I gotta hear.  So if you guys could play that again, that would be great.  I love that damn thing.  That's what got me hooked on you guys.  Opie and Anthony presents the All Requests Worst Of Show.  Call 877-4-WORST-OF and tell us what you want to hear.  And remember, if it sucks, it's your own damn fault.  Hey, folks. 
[00:01:00]  It's Mark Maron, and I'm sort of hosting this listener request show for O&A.  Why?  I don't fucking know.  They're not paying me.  Oh, wait.  I know.  It's to plug my podcast.  It's WTF with Mark Maron.  It's available on iTunes and at WTFpod.com.  You can also get my stand-up dates there, so you can see if I'm in your neighborhood or your town or your state.  However far you want to drive, man.  It's up to you.  But I'm here because O&A liked me and wanted to include me somehow, and since I'm not on the virus, this is the only way we can do it because WTF is not on there yet, but it is available at iTunes and at WTFpod.com. 
[00:01:30]  Did I mention that?  Well, there.  I just did it again.  All right.  So what happens here is I don't have to do that much, which is great.  You're already calling 877-4-WORST-OV.  That's 877-496-7786 and requesting the Opie and Anthony material you want to hear.  Then the computer sorts it out and then plays it.  That being said, let's see how many requests we have today and get this shit started.  Today's listener request voicemail has seven new messages. 
[00:02:00]  First message.  Okay.  Talk to Matt.  The bit I want to request.  My favorite all-time Opie and Anthony bit ever.  Gangsta Fag with Patrice Von Neal.  Thank you.  Message deleted.  The full request for WTF show.  Kenny, Jersey.  Yo.  What's up, Kenny?  Gangsta Fag, yo.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Gangsta Fag.  All right, we got it.  The name of the band is Gangsta Fag, or the name of the rapper.  He's a black, hardcore rapper.  But he's gay.  Yeah, but he's gay and he's proud of it and he raps about it.  Shit.  You ever get him on the phone?  We're trying to find this guy, right?  Joe Rogan turned us on to this guy.  Joe Rogan gave us this CD at the poker thing in L.A.  When we were broadcasting from that last year.  And it's one of the favorite things we like doing on this show is playing some Gangsta Fag. 
[00:03:00]  Well, favorite?  I don't know.  It's up there.  It's disturbing.  It's very disturbing.  But people enjoy it out there.  Are you playing the one about the...  He wants it.  He wants it.  This is so bad.  It's so disgusting.  You want to set up the song for Patrice?  Well, it's Gangsta Fag.  Well, the song's story is there's this gangster and he's a fag.  Okay.  And he hooks up with this white... 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  He comes off like a businessman kind of guy.  Rich businessman.  He's married, has kids, but he's bi-curious, I guess, and checks it out.  And once he's had a taste of Gangsta Fag, he latches on to this guy and just wants him all the time.  The Gangsta Fag just, you know, used him as a lay.  And he intricately put this together.  Yeah.  In a rap song.  In a rap song.  And it's just disturbing.  Listen. 
[00:04:00]  That's it.  By the way, this will just outrage the middle of America.  The truckers will just...  They'll pull out shotguns.  That's fine.  See, I was getting high with my boys one day.  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by in his really funky bands.  I could tell right away this motherfucker had hands.  Was a white dude, about 30-something.  Kept staring at me, yelling like he wanted something.  He called me over and he asked for directions. 
[00:04:30]  I saw his dick when it's hard, so I peeped his car.  I said, you dying.  You know you ain't lost.  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off.  And he said, oh no, there must be a mistake.  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very strange.  So I said, take my number and my name.  You can quote me up when you're sick of playing games.  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants to.  So what the fuck you think?  He needs to.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants to.  Because if you see one bag, now you'll see them all. 
[00:05:00]  He wants to.  So what the fuck you mean?  He needs to.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants to.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall.  One week later, and he finally called.  He said his family's gone for a week or two.  And he was really bored and needed something to do.  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills.  A poor man's house worth a couple of meals.  He said he wasn't gay, he just wanted to chat.  And I had father later, he's massaging my back.  In his white room, he gave me some hair.  Went in the next room and fucked on his kids' bed.  Fuck that we fucked like bitches in heat. 
[00:05:30]  I came on his face and all over the sheets.  I knew that I was done when I started getting sore.  I grabbed the kid's toe and I wiped my dick off.  He's lying on the bed still trying to recover.  I'm dressed in my egg, my car, I heard he's robber.  He wants to.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants to.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  He wants to.  So what the fuck you think?  He wants to.  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants to.  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all. 
[00:06:00]  The thing was so good that he just couldn't pass up.  So all that week, yeah, I'm telling that answer.  Because he loves to ride him and he loves to suck him.  And after I was done, I let my homeboys fuck him.  Now his punk ass calls me every day.  I told him we were through, then he said he would pay.  So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tackle.  He laced me with the cash and the visa platinum.  One month later and the cat's out the bag.  Because this motherfucker started dressing in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  It was time to cut him off because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg.  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg. 
[00:06:30]  I scream and don't leave, please twist it, G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you mean?  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  So what the fuck you mean?  So what the fuck you think?  Because if you see one bag, then you'll see them all.  This is Tom's life.  Tom is not gay, okay?  I want you to stay away from Tom. 
[00:07:00]  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You can stay away from me, you son of a bitch.  No, no.  Don't put this in the storm.  I'm calling.  I miss you, you're twisted.  Twisted, please call me.  Please, I miss you.  I miss you, I miss you.  Fuck you, I miss you.  I miss you, I miss you.  I'm so fucking mad.  I love you, Twisted.  Please, fuck you, call me.  Don't be interested.  Please, please.  I'm going to fight you guys.  Please.  Come on.  I don't think that part was necessary 
[00:07:30]  Where the kid had to call up Gangsta Bag  And ask why his toys were sticky  Patrice is speechless, man  Isn't that awful?  It's just shocking, man  It is shocking  It's shocking on a lot of levels 
[00:08:00]  First of all, he got studio time  Somebody gave this motherfucker studio time  And the pride  He's doing it with the pride of a heterosexual  Yeah  That's exactly the same song  Yeah, I'm fucking this guy  So the niggas came  So the motherfucker came  With the attitude and the pride  That's how it really went down  At the thing  He walked up to the rich white guy's car  And goes, I see your dick is hard  What's up, nigga? 
[00:08:30]  You'll call me  That nigga called me  That motherfucker would have been screeching down the road  With 911 on his cell phone  I think I was being carjacked  Not fucking getting his phone number and shit  What's up, motherfucker?  Yo, what's up?  What's your name?  Anthony  What's up, nigga?

Fuck that  You can back this one up  The black community wouldn't accept this  I mean, I work with a lot of rap artists  And I know they wouldn't accept this  Especially Washington  Which is a heavy black area  They wouldn't accept this  I think it would be a little rough  If you're like  Touring around town  With your windows down  Cranking up  Gangsta fag  Exactly  Gangsta fag  Yo, fuck that  Niggas respect me and my pink rims  Yeah  Pink rims  Hey, Stuart from Alabama says  Nothing like having your stepdad walk in

[00:24:00]  They calling him a fag  And they kicking his face  I put my gat  And I'm letting it spit  And I don't really care  Give a fuck who I hit  They jumping the car  Now they run like bitches  The dead motherfuckers  Just dug the dishes  Run from the摒o  Run from the摒o  You know  It's the GCon  That brings the front  Run from the摒o  Run from the摒o  I guess  You picked the wrong  Fucking back  That fucked way  Run from the摒o  Run from the摒o  You got to admit, it's catchy. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You feeling that shit?  You feeling it?  I like that, run from the back.  Who's going to be humming that later today?  That was fucking my boo up, yo.  That was hitting my boo in his mouth.  And I had to come out and take care of that business.  This is real shit habit, too, yo.  I came out in my drawers, yo.  Look at this guy, Bill Kirkland from Ohio.  He can't take it.  But he's like, get that fag shit off my fucking XM radio.  This morning's show sucks.  He's one of these guys who's really uncomfortable with it. 
[00:25:00]  Word, word, word, Mr. Ohio.  First letters are O, you know what I'm saying?  Classhole, you know what I'm saying?  We up in there, we up in there.  We in Ohio, too.  Dude, you got to relax.  Don't worry so much.  Don't worry.  You listen to it.  It's not going to turn you into a fag.  Wait a minute.  You can't tell a motherfucker from Ohio not to.  He's scared of heterosexual black men.  So now there's some fag black dudes that are still the same black guys that he's scared of. 
[00:25:30]  These ain't sissies.  This nigga's like, what's up, white man?  Get against the tree.  That's what the weirdest part of this fucking national audience is.  The weirdest part of having a national audience.  How can you tell him not to be scared?  If I came in and said, yo, how you doing?  I don't suck dick.  He'd lose his mind.  He would get scared just to say, I don't suck dick.  I'm chilling.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo, is your daughter around?  Anything like that?  He'll be like, mother.  But if I come around and go, yo, is your son around?  If he's not around, you, nigga.  Now he's, yeah, freaking out.  I just want to say. 
[00:26:00]  You mean they can rob you and fuck you?  This is fear.  You know this is the last state that voted for Bush.  These motherfuckers put Bush in office.  You think, gangster fag, this nigga's not driving it.  He's stopped right now.  Somebody's picking it.  They can carjack me and fuck me up.  Yes.  That's a new fear.  You got a new fear.  Don't worry.  You have to decide what you're going to tell the cop.  You was robbed or fucked.  Both.  Shit, I lost my diamond watch, but I was raped.  Yeah, how do you explain your story to the cop? 
[00:26:30]  Hmm.  You see, there was this gangster.  Yeah.  He took my BMW and all my money.  You can't, you can't blame a guy in Ohio for, this is so.  I should give him a pass.  You should give him a pass.  All right.  Because this is so, only people in LA and New York could ever find this to be funny.  Because we understand this whole thug, this down low, gangster fag, this thug, what do 
[00:27:00]  they call it, homo thug shit.  That shit's inner cities.  That's poor motherfucker.  Bill Kirkland is sitting there.  I'm Bill Kirkland and I'm upset.  I don't need to hear this kind of stuff.  This morning's show sucks.  Right.  It's like.  He's all angry.  Because he has no point of view.  He's just, this is complete fear.  But he doesn't want to go, I'm so scared of this.  He's hearing it.  You guys stink.  He's picturing like.  I'm sure that's going to give him mama jokes and battle of the sexes.  He's picturing like that he's the guy in the car and the gangster fag came up and it's 
[00:27:30]  freaking him out.  It's scary.  It's the middle of the country, dude.  You travel around this goddamn country.  I got thrown out of Ohio.  I was in Cleveland.  They tossed me the fuck out of.  I started talking about the war.  The bitch goes, we can't have you here.  Yeah.  She paid me and got me the fuck out of her goddamn town.  And this guy, you can't blame him.  All right, Bill, you get a pass.  Let's get back to the faggots.  I'll hear the rest of our faggots. 
[00:28:00]  And when they turned around, we stuck the gas in their mouth.  Put them on their knees.  Now they're sucking our dicks.  We're not on our face. 
[00:28:30]  And we're watching it drip.  Now get the fuck up.  I'll give you three to run.  One, two.  The motherfuckers are done.  Run from the faggots.  Oh, they shot him, too?  They shot him.  Motherfuckers made him suck their dick.  This is scary.  What about that coming, man?  That's hardcore.  This is scary to a motherfucker in the Bronx.  You know, put the G-check on the faggots.  Run from the faggots.  Run from the faggots.  I guess you pick the motherfuckers like the fuck with.  Yo, you know what I'm saying?  What?  Yo, they was in time back in the days.  Motherfuckers used to run up on fags and figure, you know, 
[00:29:00]  you can do whatever the fuck you want to them.  You know what I'm saying?  But this is like a new time, a new motherfucking age.  So the next motherfucker you run up on trying to call,  call yourself what?  Game bashing, motherfucker?  You're going to end up being the motherfucking fagg yourself.  Believe that shit, yeah.  Now we're hunting for the heads to rolls.  Four down and four motherfuckers to go.  So we lay low and stay blazed on weed.  That's when we get the call and that's all we need.  We get the address of the place they rest.  Grab the artillery and bags are set.  Kick in the door and we see our victims.  Four rednecks and the girls are with them. 
[00:29:30]  Step in the room and you can smell the fear.  Don't nobody move because the fags are here.  Bought a party's only what you're making.  Make gold, the guys, strip and get fucked naked.  Put them on their knees, now we're fucking them all.  Let the shit on my top, now you're rubbing my balls.  The girls are in tears.  Can't you watch your suck?  Yeah, I guess you picked the wrong fucking fagg to fuck with.  All right, this is scary now.  All right, this is scary now.  I'll murder your ass.  And I'll murder your ass. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  And your girl's going to watch.  Check yourself, motherfuckers.  Next time you try to run up on a motherfucker.  Check yourself.  I have something for your ass.  Wow, that was scary.  He doesn't seem like he's walking down the street for anybody to know he's a fag.  Well, it all depends.  He could be all tough and shit and dress like the goddamn village people leather guy.  Then you'd know.  Well, and the tough thing, too, is that no matter how tough a gay guy is, he fucks you up. 
[00:30:30]  You still got to explain it.  So if I get my ass beat by a gangster fag, I still got to go.  Everybody's laughing at me and I still got to go.  He'll fuck you up, too.  He's a big guy, man.  Don't.  He'll whoop you up.  That motherfucker can fight.  Don't you think just because he's a fag that, you know.  That nigga got to kick your ass.  He got fists like a man.  And, you know, fags are sneaky.  You know, what he did.  Come on, man.  Let me tell you what he did.  That nigga, I got to picture that nigga, man. 
[00:31:00]  He on my space.  Look how big he is, man.  He knocked you out.  He knocked you out.  I bet he would.  The guy is frightening.  Let's go to Cindy in New Jersey.  Cindy.  Hi.  Hey.  Have you guys ever heard of the Stonewall in New York City?  No.  No.  All right.  Well, it's a big gay bar and they have Thug Night.  Good answer, Opie.  Thank you.  Huh?  And they have Thug Night there.  Thug Night.  And what's that about?  It's all gangster guys. 
[00:31:30]  Get out of here.  It's funny as hell.  Yeah.  I thought there was maybe one or two.  It's not a joke.  And see, white women think it's funny right now, this whole DL thing.  Yeah.  But you do not play around with the DL shit with black women.  They do not fuck around with this gay thing.  Yeah.  What happens?  It's just like you can't even play around.  You can't even play.  Like, we playing right now.  You can't play around in front of black women about this whole.  Because this guy wrote a book on the DL, I think. 
[00:32:00]  And black women are just deathly.  My mother, she hates that whole gay guys that fuck women and shit.  She does not play around with that shit.  Because they're gay, but they fuck women.  And on the down low, they go out and hook up.  Yep.  Emily.  Yep.  What's up, Emily?  Hey, nothing.  How are you guys?  We're having fun today.  How's your dad looking forward to the big move in January? 
[00:32:30]  And where?  Oh, I thought Emily.  Sorry.  I thought it was another Emily calling it.  No, this would be Emily from Ohio.  Oh, okay.  She feels safe now.  They're all gay, thank God.  I was worried about the ones that'll rape me.  I fucked her in her pussy and made a friend watch.  Oh, God.  There were four guys getting fucked in the ass as their girls watched after.  Oh, that guy's the fag is ruthless.  It's fucking ruthless. 
[00:33:00]  And then the other guys behind the bar, they suck their dick nuts all over their face.  And then tells them to run.  Like the degradation wouldn't be bad enough for the rest of their lives.  It would have eaten away.  They wouldn't have been able to look at each other.  And the guy wouldn't even heard run.  After he got raped and came in the face.  Yeah.  He would run, motherfucker.  He'd go like this for about five seconds.  And then he'd go, huh?  What?  What happened?  I just...  Oh, run, run.  You know they couldn't see their friends anymore.  They'd be fucked up for life.  But Gangsta Fag, no.  It's not good enough.  I'm just going to shoot them all anyway.  I think Gangsta Fag messed it up there. 
[00:33:30]  Gangsta Fag ruined a good opportunity.  He was fighting straight gangsta soul.  You got to go get your boys, right?  Yo.  Yo.  Nigga.  Yo, we got to go kill this motherfucker.  What happened?  You got to go kill this man.  Yeah.  Motherfucker rape me, yo.  Me and my three buddies are hanging out at the bar.  And we go out to the car like we're leaving.  We had a few.  And these three fucking fags... 
[00:34:00]  We was chilling, yo.  They fucking come up.  These Gangsta Fags.  Then you got to convince yourself that ain't gay.  That's not gay.  That's the new shit.  That's the new straight guy shit.  Yo, that's so ill.  It's a shooting nigga.  And they rape him, yo.  That's what we do now.  Dude.  We do that now.  They held guns to our heads and then we're sucking dick.  And after they come on our faces...  Now I'm pissed.  Now I'm pissed.  Now go get your guns.  Hold on, nigga.  What happened?  Wait, what happened? 
[00:34:30]  You allowed this to happen?  You left the bar with what?  How'd these fuckers know you?  And what did they do?  Why?  You not listening, yo.  I told you.  Listen, man.  I told you.  They walked up.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm going to tell you.  And they sucked your dick?  No, no.  We sucked their dick.  Get your shit, man.  Get your shit, yo. 
[00:35:00]  Yo, we got a ride, son.  We got a ride.  And he looks at his watch.  No, ooh, look at this.  I got shit to do around here, but I would love to help you out.  You should call the police.  Yeah.  Nigga, we cases.  We don't call the cops.  I don't, you know, we deal with drugs, murder.  Not, I don't know, not rape.  You can't.  I've never heard this before.  Sit down.  Yo, yo, yo, I got it, mom.  I'm all fucked up.  Yo, yo, yo, go with the OE.  No, we're going to have some tea over this.  This is tea.  This is homo boys. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, this is tea time.  That is rough.  That is rough.  This is green tea time.  Just sit down.  Let's explain.  A little chamomile.  Let's go to relax.  But Emily, I think, uh...  Emily, we'll try you again.  What's up?  Hey, nothing.  I was just calling to say, this is the funniest shit I've ever heard.  You like the gas effect?  Oh my God.  You've got to find this guy.  Yeah, we don't know where he is.  Someone's asking where can we buy this for Christmas.  Joe Rogan just handed this to us at a poker tournament in L.A. 
[00:36:00]  That's all we know.  This is Rogan.  Did you ever purchase that?  I know.  Did Joe Rogan purchase that?  I have no idea.  Maybe we could get him on the phone or...  I don't think Joe Rogan has anything to do with Gangsta Facts.  I would be very surprised.  You okay?  No, Rogan handed it to us and said, man, this is some of the funniest shit you'll ever get.  Oh, that's what it is.  No, man.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Like, even Marcellus Wallace wasn't fucking right after that shit.  Like, he took care of that fag.  And don't tell nobody about this shit. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, that's the first thing.  It was like...  First, no one needs to know what happened here tonight.  Yeah, I know.  I know, Marcellus.  Second, I'm going to call some hardcore pipe-hitting niggas.  Hard-hitting niggas.  Oh, they're going to work up Mr. Rapist here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  They made it edit it out.  His friend's coming after he's all right.  Oh, this is Marcellus. 
[00:37:00]  I just got my soul back, right?  Soon as I got my soul back, niggas rape me.  Now, get over here, hard-pipe-hitting niggas.  You can only imagine how he choreographed what happened to fucking Zed in that basement.  So slow.  Yo, this cop raped me.  Ah, Marcellus.  You know, Marcellus had to then kill everyone that killed that fucking Zed.  He couldn't leave him out there. 
[00:37:30]  He called Sam Jackson first.  You know, that show was going, I mean, the movie was all going in different ways.  Yeah, back and forth.  They cut out the part where he told Sam, come on down, we got to kill this nigga.  Sam, man, something bad happened.  Those motherfuckers were talking about Tony Rocky Harden being thrown out the window.  Like, they're not going to talk about Marcellus getting fucked in the ass.  They're talking about Rocky Harden being thrown out the window.  Marcellus threw him out.  I hear it was all about a fucking foot massage on his wife.  You what, nigga?  You what?  Vincent, shut the fuck up. 
[00:38:00]  What you say, Marcellus?  You got fucked in that.  You got raped?  Nigga, I'm having a corn muffin and I'm going to walk away from it.  I quit.  I quit.  I ain't killing nobody else.  You called a wolf to clean that shit up.  You better call him Harvey Kytel.  Nigga, call Harvey Kytel behind this shit.  They was fucking your ass.  That nigga was awesome.  Mushroom clown laying shit on your ass. 
[00:38:30]  God, you need the Bible, nigga.  Oh, crap.  That was it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, of course.  There you go.  When those little scamps get together, they're like a sewing circle.  They be giggling as he's trying to be tough and motherfuckers going.  You giggling?  No.  No.  Yo, man, you my nigga.  You want him to take that Band-Aid off your neck and put it on your ass? 
[00:39:00]  Boom.  Any other jokes?  Yeah, Marcellus.  I'd rather die than not joke about you getting fucked in your ass.  You are not the boss no more, nigga.  I'll take a pack of red assholes.  Red apple.  Shit.  I knew I'd say that in front of him.  Oh, my God.  Gangsta fag.  What a find.  Let's go to Devil Dan.  Devil Dan, what's up?  No, he lost Devil Dan.  He was wondering if that's a soundtrack to Oz.  Let's say hi to Rob in Montana. 
[00:39:30]  Rob.  Yeah, hi.  Even a redneck motherfucker like me thinks this is funny shit.  Oh, right on, man.  Because rednecks ain't scared.  This is that Ohio, guys.  Rednecks ain't giving a fuck about some guys.  Rednecks don't care.  They want a gangsta fag to come running around.  You know what I mean?  They go up to the northern states like that in the middle of the country.  Now they're starting to go like, hey, hey, hey, enough of this.  I've got to drive my car, and people are listening in the carpool.  This guy, he's going to play that against them when they practice them with their Jewish dummies. 
[00:40:00]  What are they called?  The militia.  The Jewish dummies down at the firing range.  The Jewish dummies.  And they release the dogs on the black dummies.  And they're not worried about it.  They're going to play gangsta fag just to keep it.  All right, fellas.  Our momentum has been a little down lately.  We haven't been doing what we're supposed to do.  So I'm going to motivate you by letting you know what's out there. 
[00:40:30]  Hit it.  I'm going to fuck you in the butt.  Oh, shit.  Lock and load, boys.  And we're going to play this music real loud.  Oh, yeah.  They just be unloading.  What the fuck?  I'm going to shoot the speakers.  Everyone's trying to get in right now.  Wheel in Denver.  Wheel, what's up?  Hey, what's up with these chicks calling in, talking about how funny this is?  This is the most frightening shit I've ever heard.  You know why it's fucking funny? 
[00:41:00]  Because it's you getting right now.  It's the pair of men.  It's like women are like, see how it feels?  And they're just like, yay.  When it's hoes and shit, that's fine.  We'll listen and laugh and shit.  But when it's like a guy, you're like, all of a sudden, hey, I've, you know, I've said  some bad things about gay people in a bar and I've left out the door with my friends  and all of a sudden, a gun is in my mouth and all of a sudden, we have become the hoes.  Gangster fag makes me suck his dick.  And then wait, you know how guys do and we want to relax ourselves with this type of shit. 
[00:41:30]  We go, all right, um, all right, would you rather get shot in the head or suck a dick?  Um, I don't know.  I say, oh, shoot me, motherfucker.  I know, I love this, the stories that come up.  It's like, dude, I would bite that motherfucker's cock off for the last fucking time he ever,  so you would have a cock in your mouth, faggot. 
[00:42:00]  Just saying, no, for survival.  Right.  If I'm in prison, you know, the first guy tries to rape me, getting his fucking dick  bit off and then they leave me alone.  Motherfucker.  He's so, I'll put on my Freddy Krueger gloves and trick him.  I'll make a ring.  I'll act like I'm hair jobbing him.  Slice his dick on.  I'll get a job in a fucking license plate factory and I'll make a metal ring with fucking  jagged edges.  I'll shove that up my ass 24-7. 
[00:42:30]  That fuck, first person tries to fuck me, they're pulling shredded meat out of the fuck.  That's what I do.  Yeah, sure.  That's what you do.  That's why he's going to jiggle around in there with the plunger handle first.  Make sure it's safe.  Gangsta fag has it all figured out.  Oh, yeah.  Imagine you pull the gun out.  You put your ass in the air.  Yeah.  And you're like, I'm going to get him.  I got something to shred.  If you got something to shred my dick in your ass, I'm going to shoot you in the back  of your motherfucking head.  God, motherfucker.  Motherfucker tried to put some shit up his ass. 
[00:43:00]  He tried to shred my dick, but I was very quick.  Let's go to Craig the truck here.  Hey, boy.  Next thing you know, I shanked a bitch.  I'm a shankin' fag.  I'm a shankin' fag out in the yard, looking at the boys, getting hard.  I'll stab you everywhere, except yo' dick.  Oh, shit. 
[00:43:30]  Craig the trucker.  What's up, Craig?  I'm amazed.  I have never in my life heard radio like this.  This is, dare I say, a shocking radio.  Well, of course, shock jocks.  Yeah, shock jocks.  Wow.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right, Craig.  Gangsta fag is just hilarious.  Gangsta fag.  Because you could, the fear.  This is scary.  Because if he was on there going, you know, I flew in my plane and I landed on his balls.  People would be like, this is my fuck.  But this dude's like, yo, I took this, I smashed his face up again. 
[00:44:00]  And then I, and then I mushed his head up in the toilet.  It's just like, this is fear.  This is prison coming out in the, this is it.  This is the, thank you, gangsta fag.  I'm bringing the yard to you.  I'm bringing the yard to you.  He's bringing the fucking, the, the little nook and cranny in the laundry room right  to your back door.  That's it.  This is visceral shit.  What happened?  I thought you had to be locked up for this shit. 
[00:44:30]  Not with gangsta fag.  Rick, the trucker.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I'll tell you what, I turned my XM on this morning.  I heard that shit.  I thought my damn fucking XM broke on me.  I'm fucking your ass.  I'm gangsta fag.  Make ass bleed.  I won't even use a bag.  Oh, he's not using a bag.  I can't wait if he makes them out raping rednecks.  I took him by his goatee and I fucking rode his booty. 
[00:45:00]  I fucked him in the back of his NASCAR car.  John in Jersey.  John.  Ah, John, go.  He had a good one, too.  Tissue time with gangsta fag.  That would have been a great line.  I snuck into his trailer.  In the trailer park.  Oh.  Well, we want to thank Joe Rogan for turning us on to gangsta fag.  Good God, mother of Jesus.  He gave that to us at the World Poker Tour. 
[00:45:30]  Only Rogan could find something like that.  Did he go, hey, Joe, what's up, man?  I know you host UFC.  There's a lot of karate going on up in this bitch.  How do you get that conversation?  But I was wondering, my name is Gangsta Faggot, right?  No offense, man.  I know you know your shit, your karate, your shit.  I mean, I got a gun in case you want to do that karate shit up in here.  I needed to make rednecks suck my dick.  I need the gun.  You know, I just was raping niggas and shit.  I wouldn't rape you, Joe, but I know you know niggas, right? 
[00:46:00]  You think this guy's for real or you think it's so real?  Some rapper that's just fucking around.  You know, his voice is hard.  It sounds a little bit like insane clown posse.  It sounds, usually you can't fake hard.  I don't think you could fake.  Like, you know, I'll try.  Yeah, I can fuck around, but I can't fake more than hard.  You can't fake hard.  He sounds like he...  I think this guy grew up, right?  Got his ass kicked a lot growing up. 
[00:46:30]  He can definitely fight.  But then, like, decided he reached a point where he's like, that's it.  I'm hitting the fucking gym.  Yeah.  He hit the fucking way.  He had those goddamn Tukey arms on him.  Those fucking Tukey Williams arms on him.  That's what I'm saying.  And now he's just choking shit out.  Choking.  I'm going to choke you to your almost unconscious.  Just...  Just...  You just have enough consciousness to know I'm fucking you.  Oh, my God! 
[00:47:00]  That's what it is.  He can fight.  It sounds...  You know, maybe the stories were a little bit exaggerated, but he sounds...  I don't think he fucked that white guy.  I don't think he wiped his cum on a kid's toys.  After all that shit, he's like, you know what?  I ain't buying that shit.  That's a little too far.  Nah, he didn't fuck that white guy.  Some DJ didn't think I was telling the truth.  I fucked his ass and cum on his tooth.  I think that motherfucker might be...  I don't know. 
[00:47:30]  You never know, man.  A lot of talk, but...  If he's got enough balls to try to be famous with this gig...  Yeah.  He's not a pussy, you know, I use the term...  Well, that's your bold statement there.  That's right.  He's a pussy.  Jim's got a comment.  Jim in New York.  Yeah, this is how Andrew Dice Gay would sound like.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Hey, huh?  So I'm hanging out with these figs.  Hickory dickory duck.  Hey, hey, write your own joke.  Oh! 
[00:48:00]  Dice was good!  There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.  I hate chicks.  So I found the guy to swallow my goo.  Oh!  There was an old man that lived in a boot.  I fucked him most...  I fucked him so hard.  He had to poot.  Oh!  Andrew Dice Gay.  I'm the Dice Man lover. 
[00:48:30]  Oh!  See my sparkled bedazzled jacket?  My leather?  Yeah, yeah.  Used to say dice.  Now look.  Faggot!  I just wrote in Rubies and Rhinestones.  Big faggot.  It's what I do now.  I'm over here now.  I used to be over there.  Now I'm over here by the man ass.  You ever just shove your nose in a man's asshole  and take a whiff? 
[00:49:00]  Isn't it beautiful?  It's beautiful.  And then he...  After he does it, he goes...  So this guy walks up to me and goes...  Dice, will you suck my cock?  I said, sure, I'm a faggot.  Oh!  You hear me?  I blow you.  You hear?  Oh, shit.  All day long.  Suck my cock, Dice. 
[00:49:30]  All right already.  Pull it out.  I don't want to sleep in the wet spot.  The whole bed's a wet spot.  I've been fucking you for hours.  Oh!  Andrew Dice game.  Instead of Dice, it's faggot.  Instead of Dice.  Jack and Jill went up the hill.  Jill came down.  I went up and blew Jack. 
[00:50:00]  It don't rhyme.  It just happened that way.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  The fear running around in Midwest right now.  It's just...  These truckers...  It's scary.  Yeah.  There's nothing gay about that.  They don't like it.  Just relaxing.  That's when this Brokeback Mountain shit is going to just...  That's my favorite movie.  Two cowboys.  They're in love.  And they can't even show and share their love with each other.  How sad. 
[00:50:30]  Isn't that sad?  How do I quit you?  How do I quit you?  Oh!  How do I quit you?  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  That ass.  I can't quit.  How do I...  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  I shoot a load of goo.  I used to joke about that.  Now it's a sweet, precious gift.  It's a sweet, precious gift between two men. 
[00:51:00]  I get...  Two faggots walk into a bar.  It's me and a friend.  It's not even a joke here.  Andrew Dice Gay.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I like that gangsta fag. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah?  Gangsta fag?  I fucked him.  Wow.  And imagine if gangsta fag look like Tukey.  Tukey.  Tukey William.  Oh, I know.  That's even more frightening.  They've shown pictures.  How old is Tukey now?  He's probably 50-something.  He's 50-something.  I've seen recent pictures of him,  but they don't like showing those recent ones on the news.  They showed shit from when he was first arrested. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And his arm looked just...  It triggered up my thighs, man.  It's fucking holiday hams.  He's got these huge...  I've really never seen arms like that.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, really.  Yeah.  The biggest arms I've ever seen, man.  So imagine if gangsta fag is like...  Went to prison and did some old crazy shit.  Not a chance.  And he's just a big motherfucker like that.  But he's probably a sweet man.  You know, deep down, all men just want to be loved and hugged. 
[00:52:30]  I didn't realize this.  When I was being angry towards women sexually,  I didn't realize it was because I was just a man  looking for the love of a man.  Little boy blue.  It was me.  Oh!  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Whip it out.  I'll suck that damn thing.  Oh! 
[00:53:00]  Look at Pepper Minaki.  He's got to go up.  Add instant feedback.  They're coming in like crazy now.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  Holy cow.  I haven't left this hard in a long time.  Oh, God, man.  So I'm online at the bank,  and I got my tongue up this guy's ass.  And he's like,  why do you got your tongue up my ass?  I said,  because I'm a faggot.  Oh! 
[00:53:30]  Goosh right in my face.  Goosh.  What can I say?  I love to come.  It's like,  to me,  it used to be nasty.  I would give it to broads and go,  take my nasty goo.  Ugh, goo.  Now it's like sweet strudel icing. 
[00:54:00]  Just drizzled on dice.  It's Andrew Dice gay.  The faggotito.  Eee!  Which way?  Which way?  Which way?  You bet.  Up the ass!  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Well, Gunny from PA wants to know, 
[00:54:30]  hey, Ed,  is Brokeback Mountain a documentary about you and Richard in California?  Yeah, that was it.  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  The listener request voicemail.  Next message.  Yeah, hi.  My name is Sean,  and the bit that I would love to hear again is,  Alpin' Anthony did,  a couple years back,  did an interview with Sylvester Stallone, 
[00:55:00]  where Sylvester Stallone reflected on his career,  his best and worst films,  and it was a good interview,  and I'd like to hear it again.  If it is still available, of course,  like I said,  I know it's a couple years old,  but like I said,  that would be awesome if I could hear that again.  Thanks again,  you guys rock.  Bye.  Message deleted.  Well, we're back live with The Opie and Anthony Show,  and on the phone,  we got Sylvester Stallone. 
[00:55:30]  Mr. Stallone.  Hi.  How are you, sir?  Very good, thanks.  I don't feel good calling you Sly or Sylvester.  Why not?  No, no.  Live on the edge.  I call him Double S.  Double S.  That's what I call him, baby.  Like Sharon Stone.  Hero to both blacks and whites.  One of the few.  Schwarzenegger.  One.  Sly.  The other.  And it might be one more.  Bruce Lee.  Hero to all.  Lock Up and Rocky III. 
[00:56:00]  My two favorite movies.  Thank you.  Hey, you calling from Los Angeles,  or you're in New York?  I just got to New York last night.  Okay, so at least you're not at 5 o'clock in the morning time.  No.  Yeah, you know what?  There is something to that.  You're right.  I'm actually looking at your bio,  and it's amazing to me that like 16 years after the last Rocky,  you did Rocky Balboa.  Was that your choice, or did the studio want you to do it?  Like why did you decide to redo it after such a long layoff?  Well, truthfully, the studio was completely opposed to it.  That's why it even took, I would have done it 10 years later. 
[00:56:30]  But, you know, times changed.  The paradigm changes.  The administration changes.  The whole outlook of the business changes,  and it became much more what we call a tentpole industry  where you'd make very, very large commercial films a la Spider-Man  and the smaller kind of films.  And Rocky was kind of like an independent film that caught on.  And the fact that I wanted to play it at my age  didn't exactly send off rockets in their heads.  You know what, though?  I didn't know if I was going to like it or not. 
[00:57:00]  And I watched it.  I thought you did a really great job with it.  I loved the direction it went into.  It was like a really, it was a believable storyline.  I mean, it wasn't a guy coming back  and just knocking out all these young contenders.  It was great.  Exactly.  I thought if you made it an exhibition fight,  it would be plausible.  But more importantly was,  can you hook on to his dilemma?  If you can, then you have a story.  What was his dilemma?  Well, you know, you've lost everything in your life,  things that really, really matter.  How do you go on to the second half of your life  knowing that you've lost the things  that have been most precious to your love, 
[00:57:30]  your wife, your child?  Can you find some kind of enthusiasm  that sparks an interest to keep moving forward?  Wow.  Now, 20 years later, you're releasing Rambo,  which is just called John Rambo, or is it just called?  Well, it was going to be called John Rambo.  And then we wanted to be clever and go like,  why not to hell and back or up Blood River?  And then it started sounding like a, you know, a serial film.  Then John Feldhummer runs Lion's Gate and says,  why don't we just do something? 
[00:58:00]  I just call it Rambo.  And even though we've had a movie called Rambo,  I think there's been enough time in between  that you can't mistake that.  Now, what's going on with the,  you remember the Andre the Giant stickers  they used to have around?  No.  Remember that those Andre the Giant faces?  It's just a drawn face of Andre the Giant.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got like this, that thing going on in the streets.  Oh, you got the Rambo.  It's just that drawn.  It's his face just stamped on everything.  Yeah, just kind of.  As Rambo.  What is that about?  You know, guys, that to me is, 
[00:58:30]  that came from Lion's Gate, a man named Tim Palin.  And I think it's actually genius.  I never would have expected it.  They'd taken a regular photo  and sort of reduced it to like street art.  And it's so, so, I don't know,  obvious from a long distance away.  And then I said,  you know what,  it's just catching on subconsciously.  You know, it looks like the Che Guevara.  Right, right, right, right.  And which is so burnt into people's brains.  Well, Andre the Giant stickers.  All right. 
[00:59:00]  I don't remember the Andre the Giant stickers.  It's just a round, you know what I mean?  All right, all right.  I'm waiting for Cliffhanger,  the 20th anniversary one.  Oh, man.  You're going to be waiting along.  This time he gets a job as a window washer.  That Cliffhanger was a great movie, man.  One of the best opening scenes ever shot  was you hanging off that rope,  holding her hand and looking down.  Wait a minute,  was he disgusted with Cliffhanger?  No.  No, it's just probably,  who wants to hang it?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, Sylvester Stallone, 
[00:59:30]  were you,  is that one of your favorites  or is that one of your least favorites?  It's one of my favorites.  I'm saying the idea of going through that,  those heights and the hardship.  I mean, I'm not a height person.  Right.  And after a while,  you just can't take it anymore.  You're going to work 12,000 feet in the air every day.  So you were doing like a lot of rock climbing  and stuff yourself, right?  Well, to a point, yeah,  because you have to,  you know,  but something happens  when you're doing films like that  and a lot of mountain climbers  said it to be true.  After about a month, 
[01:00:00]  you go up there,  you're terrified.  Then after about a month,  you find yourself  going closer and closer to the edge,  turning your back,  eating your lunch,  hanging over the side.  And it just pushes man's ego  to see how far you can go  before you fall to your death.  All right, sir.  Now, here it is now.  Don't take offense.  I just need to know.  All right.  What is the back story of Viagra Rambo?  What is that?  The old man Rambo, 
[01:00:30]  the 20-year-later Rambo.  Not you,  but the dude  who's like 20 years from the last dude  who fought the Russians.  Exactly.  Well, he goes back to Thailand.  He lives on the border of Burma.  And I've seen,  I perceive this guy  as kind of moving back  into the jungle,  almost becoming animalistic  because he doesn't communicate  with humanity anymore.  He's lost his faith in God.  He's lost his faith in humanity.  But he's very,  very strong,  very brutal,  very powerful. 
[01:01:00]  And he's a river man.  He's a boat man.  And these people  have to get into Burma,  these missionaries,  because they do this  truthfully every year.  And the only way  to get in there  is upriver  because all the mines,  all the trails  have been mined.  And that begins  the adventure  where Rambo now  starts to feel  a rekindled connection  with humanity.  But I think  I was in the best shape.  I've been in a long time  for that.  But I wanted to be  not a bodybuilder look,  but more of a  working class,  hard man, 
[01:01:30]  like a lumberjack.  You mean more like  the original Rocky  where you were big and strong  but not necessarily cut.  Exactly right.  Exactly right.  And we accomplished that.  So the audience would say,  oh, okay,  this is believable.  But it's not vain  and it's not self-conscious  of trying to look vascular  and all that sort of stuff.  And you're 60 years old, right?  61.  Wow.  61.  Amazing.  Holy moly.  Don't keep me out of that one.  Did you ever?  And that's why I call it  Viagra, Rambo.  I mean,  it's just like,  you know,  I'm not,  no,  jeez,  I'm just joking. 
[01:02:00]  It's amazing.  Now,  okay,  we were just talking about  like all this,  the stuff we were just talking about,  the racial stuff or whatever.  Now,  remember in Rocky,  in Rocky,  not in Rocky.  Rocky 5.  Not Rocky 5.  Rambo,  First Blood 2.  Or First Blood 2.  And that girl,  and that pretty girl  that was like,  Wambo,  Wambo.  And the,  ridiculous.  Are they going to be having  that kind of stuff now?  Are the people in the movie  like,  you know,  we got to,  we're Vietnamese  and we,  you know,  there's none of that,  Wambo.  We just had to be as truthful 
[01:02:30]  as we can.  Good.  So,  we actually hired,  because the worst situation  in the world right now,  the longest running civil war  and the bloodiest  is in Burma.  It's been going on  for 60 years.  So,  the hardest thing  was to get Burmese refugees  to play themselves,  because they're still terrified,  because the Burmese secret police  are always coming over the border  trying to pull them back.  So,  we didn't get into,  you know,  casting for just,  you know,  a shock effect.  We stayed pretty much  with the real people over there.  So,  it's mostly Burmese 
[01:03:00]  and myself  and this group  of Christian missionaries  from,  let's say,  Colorado.  One of,  I'm going to guess  one of your favorite things,  one of my favorite things  that you ever did,  and I think it took a lot  of people off guard  was when you did Copland.  The type of a role  you played there,  which was kind of like this,  the guy who doesn't  necessarily win.  Exactly.  Is that something  that you would do more of?  Because it was really great  to see people,  like,  you forget,  like,  oh yeah,  this guy's like,  not just doing action movies,  but he's,  you know,  he's a real actor 
[01:03:30]  and he's,  you know,  people kind of,  I think,  lose sight of that  sometimes with the action stuff.  Well,  you know,  that falls under the category  of Cabo to Wish,  where I love doing ensemble work.  There's nothing to me  that's more pleasurable.  So,  when I did that,  I thought it would open up  different avenues  and because everyone always says,  oh,  the most important thing  for an artist to do  is stretch.  So,  we stretched,  I stretched my waistline,  I stretched everything,  but actually,  it hurt me.  Did it really?  Yeah,  it did,  it really did.  And so,  people said,  oh,  he's not into action films anymore, 
[01:04:00]  he's doing character work,  but the audience  doesn't perceive him as that.  So,  all these mixed messages  were sent,  and truthfully,  guys,  that was the beginning  of the end  for about eight years.  That's too bad  because you were great  in that movie.  Yeah,  it's like,  I know,  it broke my heart too.  But your boy,  your boy,  that's what his M.O. was,  he was,  he was famous for that.  Al Pacino,  not Al Pacino,  Robert De Niro,  he got famous  for just losing weight  and getting fat  and his whole thing.  The difference,  guys,  is that if you're connected 
[01:04:30]  to a character,  especially first,  you know,  right out of the box  like Rocky,  so tightly connected to it  where Bobby never had that,  he was more,  more versatile,  and he would do  a variety of parts  but not be connected  to one.  That pretty much  follows you around  but when you're stuck  with that,  which is a blessing  in one way  and another,  you're not going  to get rid of it  even if,  to this day,  if you think James Bond,  you still think Sean Connery.  Right.  So you're thinking  like an example  with De Niro  is the amazing transition  from Raging Bull  and then the next film 
[01:05:00]  is the king of comedy.  Right.  Whereas you kind of  I couldn't pull that off.  But do you,  like as a performer  because you are Stallone,  I mean,  you pretty much,  obviously will turn down  scripts all day  until you find  something you like.  I mean,  no one is going  to tell you  what you have to do.  Do you kind of find  that like I want  to have the commercial  success more  or is something like  that you'd be satisfied  with like a cop land  more important to you?  Well,  therein lies a big dilemma.  You like to do  the artistic pieces  but then again,  you do want to also  reach as many,  I think,  of the public as possible. 
[01:05:30]  So I would opt more now  for doing populist films,  say like a Rambo,  things that will go out  and have the widest audience  because I've had  my opportunity  with cop land  and actually  the first Rocky  was not an action film  at all.  It was an ensemble piece.  So at this point,  I don't want to experiment  anymore  of something really  that touches,  like for example,  Edgar Allen Poe  is one I want to direct.  I can't be in it.  I'm too young  and I don't think  people hearing  Yo Poe  would work today. 
[01:06:00]  Sorry.  Was there ever a point  where you really tried  to go to some class  or something  to not be you?  Like,  was there ever  an attempt for you  to just try your best  and not be  you,  Yo Rocky?  Yeah,  you know,  in college,  you'd almost see  the Dias cast.  I would go off  like many other actors  but I was always  cast in a certain role.  There's a perception  of body type, 
[01:06:30]  the sound of your voice.  So I was always  the villain,  the mugger,  the fella  from the dark side,  the friend  that your parents  don't want you around  and that just  blossomed down  into when I came  to New York,  the first couple  of roles I ever got,  I was like,  let's go mug Woody Allen,  then you mug Jack Lemmon,  then you're the thug here.  With the Lord of Flatbush?  Lord of Flatbush.  So I thought,  why don't I write a part  about a guy  who's a thug  but underneath  the leather,  underneath the hat, 
[01:07:00]  there beats  a different kind of heart  and that's the beginning  of Rocky.  He wasn't that  in Tango and Cash,  though.  But you know what?  I played the wrong role.  Nah, man,  Tango and Cash,  that was it.  I should have played  the Kurt Russell role,  let him wear the glasses.  And I'm sorry,  I really enjoy  what people would call  your other movies.  Like, I mean,  like Rocky,  to me,  we argue all the time,  we argued before,  Rocky 3,  I'm a black dude,  by the way,  is my favorite Rocky.  And we argue that, 
[01:07:30]  but I think Rocky 1  is everybody's  mostly favorite,  but I love Lockup,  Tango and Cash,  Rocky 3,  I like the other one,  Nighthawks.  Nighthawks, sure.  But Rocky,  my favorite is one,  the last one in three.  Do you know what I love  about Rocky?  When you watch the original Rocky,  because obviously it was  a lower budget than the other ones,  when you pan into the audience  a little times,  you'll actually see at times  empty seats during the championship fight.  Just the nature of doing  like a film  before you're so known,  and then you see part two 
[01:08:00]  and you watch those scenes,  you know,  and there's not an empty seat  in the house.  I know,  it's so true.  We would have people brought in,  and we couldn't get any volunteers,  and they were going to people,  you know,  I guess homeless,  you would get local people  on the street,  any way you could get,  and they would only stay  as long as the free lunches  and the chicken boxes.  Once that ran out by noon,  they were playing  to a house full of crickets.  Yeah.  What's that?  I just wanted to know  if you still talk about  Carl Weathers and...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you still, 
[01:08:30]  I mean,  it's kind of a corny question,  but it's like we become  kind of invested  in these characters  after all these years,  and you associate  Rocky with Apollo Creed.  I mean,  I assume they hang out  every holiday,  you know.  No, not really.  Carl now and then,  and he's walking down the street  in Santa Monica,  hey, how you doing?  But it's strange.  A lot of actors  don't maintain  any kind of relationship.  We all sit there  and exchange phone numbers  and say,  you know what,  we're going to be buddies  wherever it's called  to have the kids  to grow up together,  and then by the time  you get home,  amnesia.  Yeah, I guess so.  You move on to the next project 
[01:09:00]  and they move on  to the next project.  And what is,  is there anything  you regret doing?  Like, I mean,  you've had a tremendous career.  Is there anything  that you look back  and you're like,  maybe I don't wish  I didn't do that,  but I kind of wish  I did that.  And a turn down role.  Ask about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Anything you turn down.  Sure.  I was going to do  Coming Home,  Witness,  Romancing the Stone.  I mean,  there's many of those  and I'd end up,  you know,  interestingly,  you sometimes  are very,  very open to suggestion  and I think people  have to listen  to their,  really, 
[01:09:30]  their inner instincts  and their heart.  Half the films  I've done today,  I would look at today,  today,  if they were presented  and say,  obviously,  this is a cruel joke.  I'm serious.  All right.  They're telling us  he's got to go.  He's got a very busy  schedule today.  Well, the movie  is obviously,  where's my stupid  one sheet?  Rambo.  Yeah, I hope you guys  enjoy it.  I think it's the best  action film I've ever done.  Will you be alive  by the end of the film?  Actually,  that's the next movie  is we try to bring  Rambo back from the dead. 
[01:10:00]  It was really a thrill  talking to you.  We're really happy  that you were able  to call in.  Appreciate it.  And continued success.  Good luck with the film.  Yeah, same to you.  Take care.  Thank you.  Same to us.  That's our film.  It was cool, though.  It's amazing.  It was great.  You expect a big star  like that to not be  conversational.  It's like, oh, yeah,  he's Stallone.  He's a couple.  Very cool.  He gets carpal tunnel syndrome  pulling back that arrow  in this one.  That was a good one.  Thank you, fan.  We just talked to Rocky.  That's pretty damn  impressive, man. 
[01:10:30]  The listener  requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hi, this is Matt  from Frederick, Maryland.  My favorite past bit  from Opie and Anthony  was when the homeless guy,  Papa Rock,  was in studio.  This day,  Papa Rock decided  to bring his  guitar in the studio.  My favorite past bit  from Opie and Anthony  was when the homeless guy,  Papa Rock,  was in studio.  After Opie,  this showed him  what he was doing wrong  and cut his string. 
[01:11:00]  Leaving Papa Rock  to play a song for the guys.  But Papa Rock  ends up leaving studio.  After Opie,  showed him  what he was doing wrong  and cut his strings,  leaving Papa Rock  crying with a broken guitar.  Message deleted.  The All Request  Horse Stuff Show.  Let's go to Ralph.  Ralph, what's up?  How did I get a bad review?  I don't know.  What's up, guys?  This guy,  this guy who lives  by the pizzeria  on 48th Street, 
[01:11:30]  nice to look over there.  And after he has a few beers,  he'll start just dropping  the embalm  right in front of Black Ice.  And a few times  I had to see him  from getting his ass kicked.  I think a couple guys  tried to choke him out  with his own bandana  one time.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  All right,  let's bring him in again.  He likes, uh...  Homeless guitar dude!  Let's get him all around us.  Keith found a winner, though,  for the homeless shopping spree.  This guy's gonna be a star.  He's pretty smart, too.  He'll fix my phone's computer  one day when you're sober.  Oh, really?  Why, does it need  to be urinated on?  Get away, man. 
[01:12:00]  My friend brings him home  sometimes and, like,  you know,  cleans him up a little bit.  Talks him up there.  Oh, what?  Cleans him up?  Yeah, yeah,  because we work security  across the street there.  And, uh...  He's a guy who brings him home  and, you know,  you know, whatever.  Let him hang out.  That's a nice guy.  And he actually  thinks about his computer.  He's...  He knew it took stocks,  so he's actually, you know...  He knows...  He knows about computers?  Yeah, he does.  But then when he gets drunk,  he'll just call a lady a cunt  as she's walking by.  That's great.  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  Belligerent.  Nice.  You gotta give him  my full...  Belligerent drunk.  Hey, uh...  Hi there, sir.  Oh, hitting the Guinness now.  Hey, Pop Rock.  That's good.  Hey, Pop Rock.  You, uh...  You know about computers?  Good rock.  Oh, boy.  You fix computers?  Wow.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah?  What do you know  about computers?  How to repair them?  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what would I hurt?  Any program problems  or anything like that?  You're able to like...  I got a two-year degree, yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  See, the guy... 
[01:13:00]  Missouri...  Missouri Institute of Technology.  MIT you went to?  No.  That's Massachusetts.  Well, same thing.  Starts with an M.  Just trying to help you out.  Make it sound like  you went to MIT.  I don't fake anything.  No, huh?  Oh, hey.  Okay.  All right.  Not myself, man.  Do you like the N-word?  No.  No?  Why?  Like Kramer used it to...  I've used it before,  but then, you know,  when I started thinking,  I said,  man, you don't do that. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Just say...  Boom, boom?  Say coon.  I like white trash.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because we heard...  You know, it's New York City.  A couple of people know you.  They see you hanging around  and they call up the show  and they say that occasionally  after a few wobbly pops  that you like to blurt out the N-word  as black guys are walking by.  And a couple of times,  a couple of them almost choked you out  with your own bandana. 
[01:14:00]  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah, that might happen.  What happened?  They're walking by?  What'd you say?  Did you just say,  hey, nigger?  Or what...  I can't say that.  You can.  We want to know what you had.  Let me put it this way.  I learned my lesson.  I learned my lesson.  What'd they do?  What'd they do?  They used to call me on it  and that's it.  Taught you a little lesson?  I used to call Mexicans wet back,  stuff like that.  Used to.  Did the black guys hit you?  No, used to.  Yeah, one did.  But the Puerto Ricans come to my aid. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  That's nice.  They're like the police.  They like me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The Puerto Ricans?  And then occasionally...  I'm okay when I'm sober, you know?  That's what we're hearing.  Because I also heard that  when women walk by sometimes,  if you'd been drinking,  you'll just yell out,  cunt.  No, I'll say,  you want to fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two of them walked by me one time.  Uh-oh.  And I said,  hey, you want to fuck?  And they kept walking.  Then they walked back. 
[01:15:00]  Ah.  And they said,  hey,  she wants to take you up on that.  Uh-huh.  I said,  I'm just kidding.  Get out of here.  Wow.  You know,  it's like any other comedian, man.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  Okay, I think...  Wow.  So, obviously,  your demeanor changes  when you've been drinking.  Personality.  Everything.  Everything.  So, what did you say  to the black guys?  You can tell us.  Yeah.  No, I don't like that. 
[01:15:30]  I don't like it.  All right, but what did you say?  You don't have to like it,  but what did you say?  It's not...  We can say it, you know,  with you saying,  you're just repeating what you said,  it's an awful thing,  and you don't do this anymore.  But just to, you know,  get a little basis in fact here,  what did you say back then?  We know it was wrong,  we know it was terrible,  but what was it?  All right.  There was a black dude laying there,  and I was, like, on vodka.  Ah.  And that's the destroyer. 
[01:16:00]  Mental note.  And I walked by,  and he was laying there,  you know, in...  Pack, bus, and bomb.  And I walked by,  and I said,  you know,  nigger laying there.  Ah.  And he pulls my strap and everything,  gets up.  I'm on my way over.  He pulls my strap and everything.  He bops you outside the head.  Hmm.  And the Puerto Rican messenger people, 
[01:16:30]  you know,  they come to my aid and everything,  you know.  But I'm shaming myself for doing that.  Ah.  That's no good, man.  I'm not a KKK or nothing like that,  you know.  Yeah,  that was a better apology than Kramer's.  Certainly was.  Letterman right there.  Yeah.  You know,  it comes straight from the heart,  baby,  you know.  Yeah.  Yeah,  so now you're down with the brothers  out there on the street?  I try to be.  Yeah.  In fact,  I got several people at Rockefeller,  you know.  We hang out and everything.  Boom, 
[01:17:00]  boom.  They help me out.  Isn't that ironic?  He lives in a place named after Rockefeller.  One of the richest people.  You know,  boom,  boom,  boom,  Now it's Tishman Spire.  Oh,  is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fine.  But I hang out right across the street  from Nintendo World and all,  you know.  Yeah.  And my Rockefeller people,  we got a lot of black people  and we all get along.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No,  I changed my attitude.  I changed my drinking habits  the whole bit.  I saw you went from Bud to Guinness. 
[01:17:30]  Don't even laugh.  Why are you laughing at that?  That's kind of funny.  Hey,  I like both Bud and Guinness.  All right,  well.  You do?  Make a black and tan.  I like Sanhides.  What?  8.2% alcohol.  Oof.  I like Sterno.  100%.  Well,  I like hairspray.  How do you like that?  Beat that.  Beat that.  You ever have to resort  to maybe drinking a little hairspray  or mouthwash?  No.  Stuff like that? 
[01:18:00]  No.  Leave that to the Mexicans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dirty wetbacks.  Yeah.  Go to Gallup.  I live in Arizona.  Boom, boom.  Oh,  them and the,  well,  you deal with the Mexicans  and the Indians,  right?  Don't even go there  when they're drunk.  Right.  And when are they not?  Am I right or wrong?  At least I woke up sober.  Yeah,  right?  They're drunk all the time.  Tell us a little about the Indians. 
[01:18:30]  I can't.  Sounds right.  Yeah?  They're all laying around.  They're all laying around.  That's it.  And you can call them bad things  and they're too lazy  to stand up and hit you.  They're too drunk.  Too drunk?  Yeah,  of course.  What do you think?  Is that your Indian impression?  What do you think I said?  You want a rock?  Get the skull fracture on it.  Oh.  And then what happened?  I don't know.  Do you want a beer? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah,  that was all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I put on.  Everything I do like that  is just a put on.  Oh,  of course.  We know.  It's a goof.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Jeff  and you're kidding around.  Jeff,  what's up?  Hey,  Opie,  I got a request for you.  Can you play some  Smashing Pumpkins?  Yeah,  that sounds good.  All right.  Thank you.  Josh or John  in Indiana.  Yeah,  John.  Anthony,  don't let Opie  have the guitar.  Yeah,  I'm starting to lean that way. 
[01:19:30]  All right,  what are we going to do  with Homeless Guitar Dude?  Hmm.  One more song  before you get out of here?  No,  you got to play.  Oh,  well,  you play first  and then I play.  I can't play  on this piece of garbage.  No,  I can play,  trust me.  I know that.  You don't like that?  You heard a little,  right?  I don't like that guitar.  I hate this.  Aw.  Well,  just play a little something  and then I'll play something.  That's fair.  Put down your Guinness  for two seconds.  Yeah,  you can't.  Yeah,  you can't. 
[01:20:00]  Just chug it.  There you go.  Fucking chug it.  Make it all go away.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  That's it.  Just the mother's milk.  There you go.  How am I?  Yeah.  How am I?  Feeling better,  right?  Whoa.  Yeah.  Nice.  I'll put Mick Man,  Milk Man to hell.  I'll put him to shame  and I like it.  All right.  That's not my game.  He's got to be on the  home shopping spree.  Yeah,  he will be. 
[01:20:30]  Back up over there  and play a little guitar  and then I'm going to play.  Go back to where you are.  Give him a little room.  Oh,  no.  Give him a little room.  Oh,  no.  What do you think?  You play,  I play.  That's how it works.  You play,  I play.  One last tune,  John.  All right.  One last tune,  Mr. Rock.  How about Lucille?  Yeah.  A rock classic.  Well,  I'm going to tell you  something,  baby doll.  Uh-oh.  Okay,  I want to tell you  something.  I don't know.  He's got a little gay  in him,  man.  We all.  We all.  I've been married 
[01:21:00]  three times.  Yeah?  Not to men.  Dude,  you're good,  man.  You got to get on a  stage and do some  of that comedy.  I don't need to do  that I need to play.  Sam,  move him over.  Bruce Stinkstein.  Yeah,  over there.  Here,  push him over there.  Yeah,  we're trying to get you  on the stage so that,  oh,  this camera doesn't work  though.  Oh,  that's.  Nah,  I know.  Oh,  I was trying to help  out the pal talkers.  All right.  Homeless guitar dude,  whenever you're ready. 
[01:21:30]  I was digging for a pick.  Oh,  you want the one  you gave me?  Nope.  Just pick that off  the back of your neck  and play with that.  I'm using two picks.  That's why they call it  a pick.  You want this one?  Nope.  You sure?  Yeah.  Which one is that?  The one you gave me.  I gave them to him.  No.  Dude,  you just touched  your tooth with that pick.  I gave you a crazy person.  I did.  I was picking my teeth.  I gave you a put in your mouth.  Just hold it in your mouth.  Give me ten bucks.  Why did you do that? 
[01:22:00]  Twenty.  Why did you do that?  Twenty.  Oh my God,  is that...  What are you doing,  homeless guitar dude?  We got a...  I know.  We got a radio show to do.  We got record people listening.  I'm molesting my equipment.  What happened?  Batteries?  No.  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable this time.  I never can get decent equipment.  Oh.  No.  Probably when it rains on us.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  That helps it.  You're on 40.  Okay.  Come on.  All right.  There you go.  Almost.  You almost had it right there.  Come on.  Wait for it.  There you go.  You're 54 years old, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're on 1952.  All right.  He's adjusting all his...  He's got all these, like,  electronic boxes all over his...  Belt.  All right.  What's that?  What are you doing, sir? 
[01:23:00]  He's just tuning his equipment.  Mm-hmm.  Why is it taking long?  He was just doing it before.  All right.  Because he's a bum.  Oh.  Shit.  I forgot for a second.  What's happening?  Oh, boy.  It's not looking like it's going to happen, huh?  Cable.  Yeah.  Cable.  It's a cable network.  Cable network.  Might need a new cable.  Would you mind doing me a favor?  What's that? 
[01:23:30]  Just talking to this.  Oh, you're talking to the box.  Mind working?  Oh, I see.  You were talking to your equipment.  I'm sure you heard that before.  Yeah.  See?  I'm beyond fascinated by this guy.  Beyond.  He needs a breathe right strip.  Yeah.  Give him one, Jim.  I know.  The Louisville Slugger written on it.  What is it?  Ooh.  You're going to make me mad now.  Yeah.  It's not working. 
[01:24:00]  Is it the...  It's the amp.  Is it the amp?  Yeah.  The box with your pedals on it.  No.  The...  It's this one.  The cord.  The little thing there.  The batteries.  The cable.  Or that guitar.  Where's the retard holding it?  Between both of them, it's all of them.  Yeah.  You need a new...  Jeez.  What? 
[01:24:30]  Jiggling the...  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Are we in Vietnam, an Agent Orange catcher?  Jesus.  Yes.  You're breathing like you just ran a marathon.  Because I want to play.  Oh.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Do you know a guy named Andrew?  No.  Out on the streets?  The...  Like an Indian guy? 
[01:25:00]  Hello.  How are you?  Goes to the church.  Should we be nice and plug him into the real amp?  What real amp?  We have one?  Yeah.  He sucks, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's checking everything.  It's horrible.  For the 10th time, he's checking the exact same thing.  Three things.  The guitar, the amp, and that box of pedals that seems to fuck everything up when he touches it.  I got to get another amp.  Bypass...  You know what?  Here's what you do, my friend. 
[01:25:30]  Take the cord out of the pedals.  I know how to work it.  And put it right into the amp.  And that way you'll see if it's the pedals that's the problem.  And that cord...  Not the pedal, I can tell you.  You know how to work it, right?  You know how to work it.  I know how to work it.  Just tell me to go fuck myself.  I know.  But the thing is...  The thing is...  I'm afraid of getting shot because of the...  You won't.  It's got a short in it and everything.  No, you won't get shocked.  How do you get shocked?  It's batteries.  You can get a little bit of voltage there, but you won't get enough amps to kill you.  Just enough to make us laugh. 
[01:26:00]  I think they'll kill you with that amp.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Plugged into...  An amp.  A real amplifier.  Jam out, sweetie.  Boy.  It's the cord, isn't it?  It's a stupid thing.  Is it the guitar?  I can't do a decent guitar.  No, huh?  There you go.  We're getting there.  Oh, boy.  That sounds...  I...  See? 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  You got a short where?  In the guitar?  Yeah.  Jiggle the cord.  Yeah.  It's not that.  It's this.  This pot.  Oh.  What happened?  It was working fine.  Yeah.  It was, but it gets boom, boom.  Opie, you know a little something about guitars, don't you?  No, not really.  I bet you could fix that.  I bet you could, too.  I bet you can make it.  I actually want you to fix it.  I bet Opie can make it so that that switch is no longer a problem at all. 
[01:27:00]  I bet he can make it so that switch is inconsequential.  I actually am rooting for you to fix it.  Yeah.  I can't believe I am, but I'd love you to fix it.  I really want you to fix that guitar.  I'd love you to give that guitar the fixing of its life.  Straighten it right out.  Yeah, this guy.  Bad switch, huh?  Bad cable.  Bad cable.  And guitar.  And the guitar.  When did you get that guitar, sir?  About a year and a half ago. 
[01:27:30]  About a year and a half ago?  Where'd you get it?  Dumpster.  Dumpster?  Sam Ash.  The dumpster at Sam Ash?  No.  Where'd you get it?  Sam Ash?  Same thing.  And how much was it?  75.  How'd you get 75 bucks?  The one I want is a B.C. Rich beast.  Oh, yeah.  B.C. Rich.  Know you with that.  Absolutely, man.  Guitar center.  From one guitar player to the other, man.  Guitar center.  There we go.  Here we go.  Rock and roll. 
[01:28:00]  Getting ready for Thanksgiving.  Let's go, homeless guitar dude.  Play us out of here.  Rock and roll.  Right with the pedals.  Jesus.  Enough with the fumbling with the pedals.  Fucking guys.  Oh, no.  You got to see me on top of it.  He bypassed your pedals and went direct.  Oh, no.  What'd you do?  You had it, you fucking...  He needs the pedals. 
[01:28:30]  He won't play without the pedals.  Sir, the pedals.  Oh, my God.  Would you forget the pedals for a minute?  Fuck the pedals.  You had it.  You must have hated those pedals.  Jesus Christ, with the pedals.  Enough about the pedals.  This one.  Yeah.  He was fumbling with everything incompetently.  Finally, he's ready to go.  He's just fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble.  Tell you one thing.  Stop fiddling with it.  He's perfect for this radio show to work behind the scenes.  It was perfect. 
[01:29:00]  Sir, it was fixed.  And you just kept fiddling with it.  It's fiddling.  It's not a fiddle.  I like this.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  Just play it.  Here we go.  Wait, the pedals are the pedals.  Oh, it cuts in and out because of the chords.  Tuning is optional.  There is a house in New Orleans.  Oh, you know that one?  There is a house and I don't live in one. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, he's atrocious.  You're a bad player, sir.  How about Paranoid, sir?  Can you play Paranoid?  From Sabbath?  Oh, my God.  Sarah, what's wrong with the pedals? 
[01:30:00]  The pedals aren't working, right?  This is so awful.  I don't have it plugged in.  Oh, yeah, good.  Well, why don't you play Paranoid?  Why don't you do something?  Please do something, sir.  Play a little, yeah, something pretty.  A lot of, like a, yeah, there you go.  Oh, yeah, I hear that.  I know what song that is.  That's, um... 
[01:30:30]  Stop fiddling with everything.  He keeps fiddling.  It is driving to me crazy.  Oh, he's in his left hand.  He's on the box.  He's just fiddling with it incessantly.  And the funniest part is the amp isn't even plugged in on his head.  No, it's plugged into the amp on the floor.  It's plugged into the amp on the floor, and he can't stop fiddling with it.  The battery is the cord.  I'm just fiddling.  Sir, how about some distortion?  Why don't you stop fiddling with the amp?  How about some distortion? 
[01:31:00]  It's not plugged into the little amp.  And he keeps fiddling.  Oh, just fumbling with it.  Fiddler with crabs.  It's not even plugged in, damn it.  We know that.  We know.  We've been telling you that.  I'm telling you that for four hours already.  There he goes.  Now he's got it.  He's got it unplugged.  There you go.  Now lean over there and fumble with it some more.  Oh.  This is horrible.  This is...  Could you tune the inside of your mouth with a shotgun?  This is one of the greatest days ever, man.  There you go.  This is so awful. 
[01:31:30]  It's just great radio.  I love it.  I can't even tell you.  Oh, this is horrible.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, a little STP.  Yeah, tune it.  Come on.  Yeah, tune it.  Keep playing it.  It keeps getting out of time.  Keep playing that song.  Somebody have another guitar.  All right, cool.  Come on, play that STP song.  Yeah, it's on Temple Pilots, man.  Yeah, right.  They're wonderful.  Beautiful people.  All right, will you...  Okay, maybe not, but...  Well, she... 
[01:32:00]  What a fine time.  What a fine time.  To fuck Lucille.  Fuck, fuck Lucille.  For horny bankers jacking off in a field.  Everybody.  I've had some good fucks, and I've had some bad fucks.  This time, your asshole won't heal.  You picked your fine time to fuck Lucille.  Thank you, Kenny Rogers. 
[01:32:30]  All right, go with...  Let's go with...  Oh, I just want to go home.  All right.  Hey, homeless guitar dude, give us a...  Just jam on the guitar now.  Just go for a jam.  Jimmy just said it all.  What did he say?  It fits.  I just want to go home.  I just want to go home.  Another one bites the dust.  Oh, that's funny.  All right, here we go.  No, that amp isn't plugged in, dude. 
[01:33:00]  Stop fumbling with it.  Darn his shit off.  No, come on.  What are you plugging it...  You're taking it out of the good one, and you're putting it back into the one that doesn't work.  Why don't you stop meddling with that one and put it in the good one?  That's what she said.  He's fucking fumbling with it.  Sir, it was working in this one.  Now it's...  Now you've just got to keep reaching down. 
[01:33:30]  The cable.  You've just got to get the cable with the fucking tuner.  He's just got to keep reaching down.  Work already.  Work already.  I'm used to my little baby.  We understand that, but it was working in that one.  Listen, orange juice.  Oh, will you stop?  It was working in that one.  Speaking of OJ.  Oh, my God almighty.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  It was working in that one, and he plugged it back into the one on his hip. 
[01:34:00]  Of course.  Will you stop picking at it and put it back in there?  We're running out of show.  So am I.  Please stop.  I don't like that.  Will you put it into the one that was working and stop trying to make it all better?  There you go.  Put it in there, and just stop incessantly fiddling with the things on your belt. 
[01:34:30]  Jimmy, you've got to stop.  You can't breathe.  Now you've got to put the other one in.  You can't breathe.  You killed it.  That's the cable.  It's non-stop already since Free FM.  You have been fucking fumbling incompetently with that equipment.  Oh, my God.  It's incompetent equipment.  I am fucking trying.  I'm going to tie straight into the end.  He's still reaching for the left one.  I'm going to break it.  Dude. 
[01:35:00]  My ribs are killing me.  I can't take it.  All right.  Sir, if you touch that pedal again, I'm going to throw something at it.  You're touching the pedal.  Just, you don't need the pedal, sir.  Please.  Yes, I do.  You don't.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Jimmy, let me breathe for 30 seconds.  Please.  I'm sitting next to him.  You don't want to.  I haven't left that hard.  It's on the floor.  I can't take it.  I don't know why this is so funny to me. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Can you just...  Oh, my God.  Now he's...  What are you doing with the one of the...  Now he's with the amp on the floor.  He's plugging it, unplugging it.  Sir, what are you doing?  Just play the fucking instrument.  Just play it.  Strum it.  I'm trying to.  Oh, you're not trying to.  You fucking...  Oh, my God.  You are...  Hey, listen.  Are you...  I need everything to work properly.  Sir, it's not going to work properly.  I'm going to go without...  Believe me. 
[01:36:00]  And now you're touching the amp that it's not plugged into.  This is mind-boggling to me.  That you don't understand how that amp is not working.  Stupid battery shit.  Yeah, we understand it's the battery.  But the one on the floor is plugged in.  And your guitar is plugged into that one.  So could you please play us a song?  Do you understand?  Two countries are hearing you fucking fiddle with that equipment.  And now he's unplugging the one on the floor.  And he's plugging it back into the one on his hip.  This can't be happening. 
[01:36:30]  All we want is a tune.  Okay.  You gotta stop.  But it's plugged back into the fucking hip one again.  You gotta stop, Jimmy.  Sir, I mean this with all due respect.  Will you just take that out of there and put it into the one on the floor, please?  So we can hear a song.  It is bugging him so bad.  Because it is an endless cycle of fiddling and nothing is getting accomplished.  Oh, it's just cable here.  I don't care what it is.  Plug it in.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, God.  There.  You sure you don't want to pull it out and plug it back into the hip one again?  Holy shit.  All right.  Are we ready for a song?  We don't care about that.  Just...  He's cleaning over it.  Will you stop touching it?  Just play. 
[01:37:30]  Strum.  Watch.  Let's see how long it takes for you to go for the one on the hip.  It's not even plugged into the hip.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  There we go.  All right.  Oh, you gotta get the better pick.  Of course.  Of course.  That was the problem.  He doesn't play.  No.  All you do...  There he goes.  He's reaching.  Stop reaching.  Stop.  Stop touching that fucking equipment.  Back off.  He plays and he stops and looks. 
[01:38:00]  He's fiddling with equipment that is not plugged in.  Oh, it's enraging.  Oh, that would sound great with some distortion.  This won't last long.  How can it?  He'll stop in a second.  And he'll fumble with the fucking pedal again.  Look.  He's gotta futz.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Of course.  I fell on the floor. 
[01:38:30]  I fell on the fucking floor.  I was laughing so hard.  Play some Stone Temple Pilots.  It doesn't sound right.  You need the distortion with the pedals.  Yeah, right.  See?  They use pedals.  You got pedals?  He doesn't have pedals.  It don't work.  It's a dirty box.  Listen, we gotta get out of here, homeless guitar dude.  Thank you.  It's a dirty box.  Give us one.  There we go, of course.  You just touch it. 
[01:39:00]  Of course.  I'm just touching.  There's all these little, just busy body, little touchy, ficking fumble.  Well, we got a new name, Bo Fidley.  That's kind of like your equipment up there, right?  Oh, yeah.  I could not fucking breathe.  She went flying down the mountain, doing my mighty mountain mountain.  We know the titties on the spokes.  We heard this one already.  They broke.  We understand what's going to happen here.  Stupidly heard this.  She went flying across the grass with a muffler up her. 
[01:39:30]  And her titties playing Dixie on the spokes.  Oh, nice.  He is so in on the homeless shopping spree.  He's got everything it takes.  He's homeless.  He's annoying.  Grand finale time.  Oh, look, look, look.  There you go.  You got that twist, turn, twist, turn, twist, turn.  Maybe this will make it all better.  Maybe this will bring her back.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  I'll wake up and the comfort will be there and I'll be home.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Fix it all. 
[01:40:00]  Make everything better.  Twist, turn, plug, unplug, unplug.  What's wrong?  We're all wrong.  Plug, unplug.  Twist, turn, twist, turn.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Put the square.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Make it all better.  Things didn't turn out this way.  Unplug.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Shake a little.  Unplug.  Unplug.  Twist.  All right.  The ambulance is on the way.  Drum, drum, drum.  Oh, tune, tune.  Break, tune.  Plug, unplug.  Who cut your hair?  Shut up.  Shut up.  You used that one already.  It'll make it all better.  It'll make it all better.  It's your time to play.  It certainly is.  I said what I want to happen. 
[01:40:30]  He did say that.  I want you to give us a really good jam.  I can't put a stupid thing, man.  It's a shred.  And then I shred.  Give me a shred.  I can't do this.  Yes, you can.  This equipment is messed up.  Do the best you can.  Just shred that guitar.  You already plugged into the big amp, buddy.  It's all you need.  Give me the big sound.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're paranoid.  Yeah, some Sabbath.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Play some Sabbath. 
[01:41:00]  Where's that?  There you go, Till.  Might as well.  I've told you.  It's a crappy guitar.  We understand that.  We understand.  Why you just won't stop touching everything.  You don't build a house with a rubber handle.  That's a good point.  You don't do that right.  Just stop touching everything.  There you go.  There you go.  But I just do two or three times.  That's good.  That's good.  You get a couple of strums out of them.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I've got to buy a new equipment.  Yes, you do. 
[01:41:30]  And you'll be saying that again in about 30 seconds.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Oh, no.  You never wrote a heart.  How many of us is done?  Yeah.  You're to the end of a Kiss concert, sir?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I can certainly do it.  The Who at Woodstock.  Strangling yourself.  You familiar with that?  We do.  All right.  I hate this stuff, man.  I hate it.  Yeah.  So do we.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't blame you.  This guitar is all you...  I'm out of my way.  I need room to perform. 
[01:42:00]  You need room to perform?  I'm dragging my cord.  Oh, there's my battery.  Oh, you found it.  Thank God.  Things are going to be all better now.  Put it back in the thing.  That's good.  Yeah, put it back in there.  What do you want to hear?  What do you want to hear?  I want to hear it crashed up against a wall.  Wow.  Really?  He's heard this show before.  You really don't know this guy very well.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  I can't look.  Here you go.  Now I want you to pick it up and fumble with it.  Fiddle.  Oh, no.  It might work better now.  Jesus Christ.  Now what am I going to do? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, no.  Did you hear that?  Now what am I going to do?  Now what am I going to do?  Body parts.  I was like, treat yourself.  That's better than Howard Stern.  Now what am I going to do?  Now what am I going to do?  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, boy.  We'll fix that.  Reality thing.  I don't have anything anymore.  Oh, fuck.  Shit. 
[01:43:30]  Get the hell off of me.  I don't like scarves.  They're for faggots.  He's looking at his guitar. 
[01:44:00]  I can't play it.  Maybe a little glue.  I don't want to play it.  You know all he does is play that guitar all day.  It's all he's got.  All the music.  All the music.  Is there a doctor in the house? 
[01:44:30]  You all right?  What about a spirit?  I don't wear it.  My baby.  My baby's dead.  It's like my last three wives.  Yeah, have a little beer. 
[01:45:00]  I'll straighten it out.  Damn, you can play good.  Thank you, sir.  He plays like Pete Townshend.  The who?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  No, I mean he fucks little boys.  What? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah, who didn't?  That just needs a little Elmer's glue.  I got some super glue.  Super glue, yeah.  Yeah.  And I bet the switch won't have to...  Imagine that fucking...  Hey, happy holidays.  Yeah.  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  Oh, God.  Can I throw up now or later?  Right now.  Actually...  Where's milk, man?  Like a gurgling sound if you can throw up. 
[01:46:00]  I can't believe that.  It's just laying there.  What are you...  A year and a half.  What are you going to do all day?  Yeah, what are you going to do all day?  I bet you play guitar all day, right?  I got some glue.  I can put it together.  I bet you play guitar all day long, right?  That's like all you got, right?  So what are you going to do until you get one?  How much money do you have?  You all right? 
[01:46:30]  You all right, sir?  Hi, baby.  I'll put it together.  You think you could get it back together?  Because I can't imagine what you would do all day.  That's all you got, sir.  It's the music.  Speaking of...  Body parts.  Where's Howard Stern when you need him?  Not here, sir.  Thank you.  He's...  He'll make a good one on body parts.  We can get you a serious...  Yeah.  You can live in it.  You could actually...  Get out of here.  Live in a serious satellite unit. 
[01:47:00]  It's him.  You could go over...  Well, we'll look...  She's just setting him up to be robbed.  In the spirit of the holiday.  Yeah.  You all right there, sir?  You all right?  You all right?  You seem a little worked up.  Thinking about the lonely days and nights.  What?  Just passing by now without having anything to play.  You know? 
[01:47:30]  Because that's what you do all day is play guitar, right?  And now what are you going to do?  Jack off.  Couldn't sound any worse.  At least he's got his priorities.  Guitar, jack off.  I hear you.  He probably can't come because he keeps fiddling with his balls and his testicles and the helmet.  Every time he's close to coming, he reaches down and toys or something.  Fiddle in your package.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Make it better.  Fiddle.  Fiddle.  What happened?  Fiddle, fiddle.  You all right? 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  I'll get in another one somehow.  Yeah, somehow.  I guess.  Yeah, he's picking up the pieces of the guitar.  Actually, use the big piece to bash a tourist over the head and rob him.  You can fix that.  I don't rob anybody.  Let me see.  He's trying to put it back together.  You're a man of peace, and so is your guitar.  Pieces?  Nothing?  Okay.  Big pieces.  My jewel says pieces of you.  Aw.  Hey, someone has a good idea. 
[01:48:30]  Get him some wow stickers to help put the thing up.  Oh, hey, that's a good idea.  What about the neck?  Where's the neck, sir?  It's dangling by his legs.  He's attempting to play the broken guitar.  Put it back together.  Are you going to try to play the broken guitar, sir?  I got my...  Huh?  Is that fixable?  Yeah, what's the diagnosis?  Is that fixable, you think?  It's just the body is split in half, and the neck is broken off. 
[01:49:00]  All the pickups and stuff have been ripped out, I guess.  But can you fix it?  You know, my dad's got an ultimate set of tools.  I can fix it.  What do you think?  I got an ultimate tool, but it won't fix it.  No, huh?  All right.  What are you going to do now, tonight?  Like, you usually hang out and play your guitar, right?  Yeah.  All day and all night.  It's all you do.  Yeah.  So what are you going to do with yourself now? 
[01:49:30]  Play.  I got my wow.  Oh, wow.  He's shaking up.  Yeah.  He's...  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  Yeah.  He's bothered.  Yeah, he's definitely...  Are you a little upset?  Trying to cover it up with humor.  Are you all right?  Are you all right?  You know there's no crying in guitar playing.  You know that, right?  You're a strong guy trying to cover up with humor that you're a little upset with what happened.  But we understand. 
[01:50:00]  It's okay.  We got some vodka and I'll let you know exactly what I know.  Uh-oh.  Have some vodka.  It's all over, right?  The day.  That's why I don't...  The fiddling.  I don't drink much of it anymore.  Died.  Sir, what are you going to do now that you have nothing to do with it?  I thought you could play guitar.  I played, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, you did a kick-butt job.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to hang out.  Me and you.  Homeless shopping spree.  What's that?  You'll know in a couple weeks. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  All right?  It's really good.  You'll enjoy it.  Oh, boy.  Should I?  Yeah, it's this...  He's all fucking...  Well, it's just because it's Thanksgiving.  He's really bad.  Oh, my God.  He's crying.  I'm a little...  He's crying.  Dude, he's fucking crying.  Are you crying?  No.  Oh, yes, he is.  Oh, boy.  Sir, that's all you had.  Yeah.  That's my baby.  Help the nigger out.  Come on.  Well, here's the deal, you know... 
[01:51:00]  Sir, what are you trying to plug that into?  I don't know.  There's nothing to play.  Stop fiddling.  Sir, you plug that into what?  It's all he does all day.  What do you do?  Don't you understand?  Now it's a force of habit.  What does he play?  So there's no playing...  He's turning volume knobs.  He's...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Is he going to try to play air guitar?  Yeah, but play air guitar.  Maybe that'll work.  There you go.  All right.  Now you're rocking.  All right.  Now fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, and then play some air guitar.  I've got to have my wow. 
[01:51:30]  I've got to have that.  Yeah.  Well, the wow's in half, too.  Yeah.  I was going to put it on my guitar.  Well...  Yeah.  That won't happen.  That won't happen.  Because that's in parts, too.  Sir, what are you going to do now?  Did you have another film?  All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  I am rock, you whore, roll.  I am you wish you're not.  I am I will prevail.  Biatch.  I am black ugly monster. 
[01:52:00]  Now air guitar.  There you go.  Tiddle, damn bitch.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's what I normally do.  It's a little known fact that right around Thanksgiving, I tend to break out of calories.  There's not going to be any turkeys this year.  Oh, for the holidays, you're coming out of Thanksgiving, Anthony.  All right.  Just for Thanksgiving.  It's a once, one time a year that I do the right thing. 
[01:52:30]  Please let the audience know who we're speaking with here.  What?  Let the audience know who's speaking.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  A little known fact that right around Thanksgiving every year, I break character to do the right  thing.  It only happens once a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  John.  You know, some of you might have laughed today when, oh, look, he's upset.  He's really upset.  He's crying.  Hey. 
[01:53:00]  We only break down the eighth wall the day before Thanksgiving.  It's very rare.  This only happens once a year.  Sir, look at what we got for you.  Enjoy your brand new guitar.  That's for you, my friend.  That's for you.  That's for you.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Now plug it in and play something for us.  And you rock, God damn it.  Play something for us.  Plug that in and fucking rock.  Play something for us.  Oh.  Brand new fucking guitar. 
[01:53:30]  Wow.  This is like shit.  This is like Tyra.  Oh.  A Schechter, my friend.  I just had an orgasm.  Oh.  I love it.  I am the rock.  Now play.  Now play your heart out.  I'm going to have to learn how to fiddle on that fucking thing.  Oh, look, he's fiddling.  Jesus Christ.  If you reach for that, I'm going to break it.  Give me an E, you.  Yeah, give him an E.  Give me an F.  E.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:54:00]  I'm never going to get the fuck out of here with him tuning this thing.  Listen, man.  Once a year.  Oh.  Only once a year.  That was like one of those end of an episode things where you sit there and go, hi.  You know, we may have all laughed today at a homeless man's expense.  There you go.  All is right with the world, sir.  He's fucking terrible.  Dude, you like the guitar?  It's fucking awful.  What a waste of a great guitar. 
[01:54:30]  He went right back to fiddling.  It sounds...  If he fucking fiddles with one more thing, I'm going to throw the fuck out of him.  It immediately turns into a shit guitar.  I love this.  You love it?  How can you suck this band if you do it all day?  All day.  How's the action for you?  Good?  You like it? 
[01:55:00]  I love it.  All right.  I take it away from him.  I love it.  You know, I play guitar, too.  Saul has to break the news to him.  All right.  Can you play us out of here?  We've got to go home for the holiday.  Yes.  Well, that's actually a pleasure.  We've got family to see, homes to be in.  Not only the guitar, but we've got a bar of soap for you, and you, and a bar of soap for you. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  He's fiddling.  What's he doing, and why?  What's he doing, and why?  What are you doing?  Why are you twisting that knob?  Can I ask?  As a novice, you're gone awful at this.  All that fiddling, and it sounds exactly as it did.  Stop fucking fiddling.  Jimmy hit the nail on the head, though, which is just trying to fix his life and through the symbolism of all that. 
[01:56:00]  This way, this way, I'll have a place to live.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Play us out.  That's all we want.  I know.  He's sitting on it.  Where's the...  Where's the my children's loaf knob?  You know, I need to turn that up.  Oh, boy, it's fiddling.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:56:30]  Shut up.  It just sounds like he's got his fingers stuck in the strings. 
[01:57:00]  Is it too late?  Oh, forget it.  Stinks.  Johnny Slobo.  What?  Give us some distortion on that sucker.  What distortion?  Nothing's going to help this.  Unless you want that guitar distorted like your last one.  Quit your pitching. 
[01:57:30]  He's the most guitarist.  He is the most guitarist.  He is the most guitarist.  The line of the day is sponsored by BoatDogFight.com.  I've got to watch American fighters battle for the rights and represent the U.S. in a battle against the Russians.  It's on BoatDogFight.com.  It's on BoatDogFight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament in Dr. Reality, unlike any seen before.  Smell it.  It stinks, and I don't like it. 
[01:58:00]  All right, turn down.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Hit it.  When the penguins were gay, when the handlers were throwing fish, both the penguins would  go yuck and run away from it.  Yes.  And finally, thanks to BoatDogFight.com, here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  God damn, that feedback is killing my ears. 
[01:58:30]  I can't even wear my headphones.  You are Eric Crapton.  You need a manager?  Master Cole, man, you can manage him.  You should manage him.  There you go, Anthony with the line of the day.  Eric Crapton.  I left Jimmy's laugh.  It made me happy.  Hey, do we have to?  We don't have to go to break, right?  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  The L.A. Times called his speech poignant. 
[01:59:00]  Are you shitting me?  No.  The stupid L.A. Times.  What happened?  They said that he had a poignant.  I knew that you could.  Oh, brother.  I knew that you could.  Called his speech poignant.  Yeah.  All right, have a great weekend.  That can also mean sucks.  Hey, after the break, you want him just in studio till noon?  Do you think I give a flying fuck?  I will be gone.  Just turn on his mic after the break and see what's going on, all right?  Sure.  We'll have him fiddle until Ron and Fez get here.  Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Fiddle, fiddle.  See you, um, uh, at the absolute holidays. 
[01:59:30]  Jimmy, one of the biggest laughs in a long time.  My fucking stomach hurts.  Just fiddling.  Knock it off.  Fiddle, fidddle, fidddle, fidddle, fidddle.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  How's it going, guys?  My name is Greg, and I want to request the bit where you guys interviewed voters from GWAR.  Thanks a lot.  Message deleted. 
[02:00:00]  People request host of show.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Of course.  You know that.  Yay.  They ran enough sweepers telling you that.  Yeah.  Walking down the hall is odorous.  Is he going to be a...  From GWAR.  I try to talk to him.  Oh, my God.  I try to talk to him as Dave, because we saw him without the costume on. 
[02:00:30]  There's a picture that we took.  Yeah.  And I go, hey, could you just talk to me as Dave for a second?  Because I've never met you.  He goes, yeah!  But then he never talked to me as Dave.  This is just silly.  Look, this is just silly.  Why is it silly?  It's silly.  He's like his big dick thing.  Odorous is walking down the hall from GWAR.  Look what's flopping, Anthony.  I see it.  His schwee.  Yes.  Wow, it takes him a long time to walk with that big schwee swinging from side to side. 
[02:01:00]  That's what it is.  The big area.  Here's Odorous making his appearance on the Opie and Anthony show for the first time.  Oh, Odorous.  Wow, holy shit.  This isn't Jeopardy.  I don't think I was going to be on Wheel of Fucking Fortune tonight.  No, no.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we go.  Wow.  You're taking a load off.  Wow.  You guys mind if I masturbate?  I don't want to blow up any equipment in here. 
[02:01:30]  You can do whatever you want.  Oh, actually, I was watching this.  Look at that little bitch.  Yes, there's a little midget on Maury.  That little fat, black bitch.  Look at her.  Go, go.  We were on that show.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Maury, yeah.  The Springer.  Jerry Springer.  Jerry Springer.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Odorous.  What took you guys so long to have me on the show?  I don't know.  We were stupid.  The time is right.  The time is right now.  Everything happens for a reason.  Yeah. 
[02:02:00]  And there's a reason why it took a while to get on this show.  We don't know what that reason is.  All we know is that I'm here now.  Undoubtedly, I am here now.  You cannot deny that.  No, you are here now.  I'm really digging the abs.  Yeah.  Six-pack abs.  I'm ripped.  I'm just fucking ripped.  You must go to the gym every day.  Oh, God.  I'm just like, you know, never, actually.  I don't work out.  That's bad for you.  No, no.  What is your schween made of?  My schween?  Oh, this is made out of...  It looks like a pig or something. 
[02:02:30]  It's the cuttlefish of Cthulhu.  The cuttlefish, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The cuttlefish of what?  Of Cthulhu.  Yeah.  See, in outer space, it's a little different.  Like, a lot of people are like, hey, Odorous, how come you walk around?  With your dick hanging out.  And I'm like, first of all, that is not a dick.  And second of all, it's Mr. Odorous to you, punk.  And third of all, in outer space, it is considered a crime to not walk around with your dick hanging out.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you have to have it hanging out.  Or you go to jail.  I often will put a shoe on the end of it and use it for a third leg. 
[02:03:00]  It's very big, yeah.  It is big.  This is kind of the smaller version of it.  It's not fully engorged.  Actually, I haven't had a hard-on in about 500,000 years.  Yeah, I'm still waking up.  I'm still kind of de-thought.  I'm starting to touch myself.  I see that.  It's starting to fucking feel pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like it.  Are we on the radio now?  Yeah, I believe we're not.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Well, it's great to be here.  Hey, all you Gorg fans out there.  Hey, you were on Red Eye, I believe, last night. 
[02:03:30]  Yes, I've been completely seduced by the Fox corporate entity.  I am their new interplanetary correspondent, if you will.  I saw that.  They actually put the graphic on the bottom.  Yeah, I saw that.  Actually, I was looking at the website and, you know, on the CompuWeb or the intro, whatever  the hell that thing is.  There was my face right next to Bill O'Reilly's, and I was pretty excited, and then after the  show, he visited me in my dressing room, and we had oral sex, and then I said, oh, I 
[02:04:00]  might have just lost my job on Fox.  Hey, Odorous.  Yeah, yeah.  Why are you drinking coffee out of a straw?  It takes away from your whole lot.  I mean, it just...  Mmm.  It takes away from the whole quark thing, don't you think?  That's what I'm all about, though.  Just disappointment.  I'm just...  Mmm.  Yes, kiddies.  Yes, Odorous is drinking coffee.  Hey, Odorous, we have a guy, E-Rock, who wants to be sprayed in the face by that piglet thing. 
[02:04:30]  I don't know.  It takes a little while for me to get the load going.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I mean, I could probably...  If we got an intern, maybe, who can start working it?  You want to...  Well...  We could maybe work in the gherkin and get a couple jerks in, or...  Would Evan do that for us?  Yeah.  Can we get Connie Chung in here to, like, maybe suck on it?  Connie Chung.  You're kind of putting me on the spot here, you know?  Yeah, really.  I don't know if I'm really...  I just blew a huge load downstairs.  Oh, God. 
[02:05:00]  Anyway.  He's jerking it off.  It's going to happen.  I love how he's got the paint on it.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, hey.  This is Evan.  He's got a Metallica t-shirt on.  Is that all right?  What?  Yeah, they want...  Would you suck me off?  I mean, I'll give a shot.  I'm going to jerk on it here for a sec.  All right.  Touch it.  Oh, I'll think about my mom.  All right.  Evan is now touching over his... 
[02:05:30]  That's just not working.  You're not doing...  Get out of here.  He's sick.  You didn't like that.  What is it?  He's not pleasuring me like he should, like Connie Chung would.  Well, how about E-Rock?  I'll let anyone get here and suck my dick.  E-Rock, this guy's a giant fan.  I'll get on.  This is Graham, our new intern, and he's stroking the piglet shween hanging from over us.  Alien dick.  It's not working.  We need more interns in here.  Come on, get over here.  Goddamn, get a fire hose on it and kind of try to cut off the... 
[02:06:00]  They're all working.  He's very allowing.  Tickle the balls.  Oh, he's grabbing...  He's grabbing the balls now.  Oh, I have shit myself.  That's where we got to go now.  Now, we're starting to get something happening.  Giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity.  Oh, just stop.  It's a failure.  It ain't happening.  What is going on?  I thought they left the velveteen touch of a dandy fog.  Hey, E-Rock, why don't you give it a try?  How many people can...  No, E-Rock will...  I'm not good at this.  Just maybe kick it. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, give it a kick.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Go ahead.  Oh, shit, E-Rock.  Jesus, E-Rock, you're a little angry, aren't you?  Guys, I mean, come on.  Can we talk about something else except my fucking cock?  Yeah, if it wasn't so, like, right out there...  Well, look, I'll tell...  All right, he's hiding his cock.  How long have you been with Gwar?  I am the original.  Yeah.  The prototypical.  The one who has been there.  I mean, we are actually been together as a rock group band for over 25 million years. 
[02:07:00]  But, you see, we only were dethawed recently.  I don't know if you're up with your Gwar lore, but we were trapped in Antarctica in the frozen  ice, so the story goes.  Sleazy P.  Martini, our manager, was on the run from the IRS.  He was shot down over Antarctica.  Wow.  He stumbled into our tomb at the precise moment that the ozone had burned a layer hole through  the ozone layer because all those poofy hairspray bands like Brittany Fox were using too much 
[02:07:30]  of that stuff on their big poofy rock and roll wigs.  And also, Bret Michaels is bald.  I was so glad when he got hit with that piece of scenery.  I thought that was fucking hilarious.  But anyway, what was I talking about?  Oh, yeah.  And then we woke up and Sleazy was like, what a great band.  What's the name of your band?  And I looked back at him and I said,  And he's like, that's not going to fit on a t-shirt.  I was like, can we go with Gwar?  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  And it's been 25 years of rock and roll.  I was trying to think of the right word for it that wouldn't be too self-insulting.  Devastation, mayhem, chaos, carnage.  These are all things that apply to Gwar.  I was just asking that because I was wondering if ever there was a time where you could actually  trace your abs when you did that.  No, absolutely not.  I'm completely out of shape.  It's against my religion to exercise.  What happened to Adam Carolla last night?  Well, I mean, I was just funnier than he was and I don't think he liked it. 
[02:08:30]  Was he being an asshole?  I mean, he came on the show.  The first thing he did to get me mad at him, not mad so much, because being an intergalactic  celebrity, I've seen all this stuff before.  I've partied with the Pope.  I've licked O.J.'s poop shoot.  I've done coke all over the place.  But Adam Carolla, I actually had a little bit of respect for him because of the man show.  I thought, you know, that was pretty good with the chicks with the tits jumping up and  down on the trampoline.  Sure.  So what does he do?  He comes in there.  The first thing he says is, I'm more of a Slipknot fan. 
[02:09:00]  It's like, dude, Slipknot, yeah, they got a great drummer.  They're an awesome band.  But it's just a bunch of dudes dressed up in monster costumes.  You know, like Lordy or, you know, whatever.  It's like, with Gwa, you're getting the real thing.  Right.  Something.  I don't know what it is, but it's real.  That pissed you off.  Well, it didn't really piss me off, but, you know, I was kind of, you know, I just said  something about, like, they were talking about the U.S. Open, and I decided to go for it.  I made a comment about, couldn't get past the fuzzy balls. 
[02:09:30]  And, you know, right then he's like, this dude is funnier than I am.  He accepted it.  And then he started talking about other stuff.  And, you know, they had him in Hollywood.  Like, at one point during the conversation, when I figured out the screen on the wall  was actually a screen on the wall, I actually thought he was in a little box for a while.  But then he was like, I was trying to, like, establish rapport with him, and he just did  this.  He was sitting in front of a picture of the Hollywood sign, and he just did this. 
[02:10:00]  Like, I'm from Hollywood or something.  Yeah, point like, hey, look where I am.  It's like, ooh, yeah, I'm from Antarctica, okay, Adam?  I don't know.  I don't know what's up with him.  But we didn't really, it's not like we, you know, got into it with switchblades in  the alley, but, uh.  No, Steve was always, yeah.  I was just, you know, I was just funnier than you, Adam.  I was funnier than you.  And when I made the comment about Blanche having a stroke, everybody lost it in there. 
[02:10:30]  Now, what's your political views?  Politicians crucified.  We will draw up the contracts of laws for the new world on their skinned butt flesh.  Yeah, the only reason we have politicians in outer space is so we can crucify them.  Oh, interesting concept.  Yeah, I mean, they're pretty useless, aren't they?  I mean, it's pretty funny, too.  You're a little more left or right leaning.  You know, a lot of people try to get me, like, Odorous, what's your political view?  Are you left wing?  Are you right wing? 
[02:11:00]  Do you even have a wing?  Is it a chicken wing?  You know, I would have to say, as much as I'm a liberal and a progressive and a creative  thinker, the right wing embraces concepts I'm more familiar with, like war and disease.  They didn't do anything for AIDS, really.  They started two wars that are just going nowhere.  I guess we're running out of Iraq right now.  We're trying to fight these guys in, I mean, have you seen, like, the way spiders look over  there?  They're huge.  Those things that live on the camel scrotums. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, how are we going to beat these people?  These things are, like, they live in the Taliban's genitals or something like that.  It's like, there's no way we're going to win.  But anyway, yeah, politicians, they suck.  I mean, just elect odorous.  Actually, my manager, Sleazy P. Martini, he is quite the international political figure.  He's kind of the man behind the scenes, pulling the strings and controlling the porno and the  crack industries, which is good for me, because I love porno and crack, and I love the hell  out of them, really.  What do you do when you're not performing? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, lay around in a drug-induced stupor, pretty much, yeah.  I drink a lot.  A lot.  You have to drink a lot to be in this band.  Yeah, apparently.  Well, I just mean, like, you know, when you're not in the band, you're just mellowing you  golf?  I golf, yeah.  You know, a lot of people are like, oh, it's golf, you know, but I do use Fuzzy Zeller's  decapitated head as a ball, so.  How did he manage to save his career, anyway, after he made that horrible remark about Tiger 
[02:12:30]  planning a buffet with chicken and watermelon and whatever else those people eat?  How come he got away with that?  But Jimmy the Greek got busted for saying, look at that monkey run.  I mean, come on!  There's a double standard here.  How come Michael Richards gets to come back and do the new Seinfeld when he said that stuff  about sticking a fork up that dude's butt?  I mean, what, you know?  Come on.  Yeah, but, you know, in the Seinfeld context, I guess it's fine. 
[02:13:00]  Well, I think it kind of adds more to Kramer's character to find out that he's a racist and  a homophobe.  You know, it's like, yeah, I'm kooky, I'm wacky, I hate gay people.  Oh, there is from Guar.  He's dripping coffee on his coddle fish.  I was freaking up at, like, five in the morning, still, like, babbling insanely after my triumphant  red-eye appearance, and, like, I've been going non-stop ever since.  Yeah, this coffee's pretty good.  Did you look in the mirror and just laugh your ass off when you first put that on? 
[02:13:30]  Well, you know, I look in the mirror, and I see perfection.  I see everything that I want to be, and then I paint my six-pack abs on.  Guarles have actually thought that was real before, so I tried to paint a bigger penis  on me, but no real need for that.  Well, that's good.  You never tripped over those balls, did you?  Oh, no, many times.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, these are the brain balls.  Yeah, there's a lot going on down there.  There's brains.  People have accused me of thinking with my penis. 
[02:14:00]  So you got the brains.  On occasion.  The balls.  Yeah, see, it's like, I had to have my brain removed from my skull because it was too obvious  a target, even though I had skull surgery to remove a tiny piece of brain that was still  stuck up there.  It's like, basically, I figure if they can't get at my brain, then they can't kill me.  Not that it's a really important organ anyway, but I decided I would get them closer to my  penis and just kind of keep the operation going a little bit better. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, in outer space, a lot of people actually have their faces right here so they can eat  their own shit.  I'm serious.  Let it be known.  He just points to it.  Taint is a face.  A face is a taint in outer space.  I do miss outer space.  Hey, what do you think of what's going on in music these days?  Well, it's crap, isn't it?  I mean, you know, I'm so sick of hearing these bands, especially in metal circles, that are  just rehashed, you know, Slayer riffs, basically.  I mean, I think when Dime, bless his heart, when that idiot in Columbus blew his head off, 
[02:15:00]  you know, that was a really sad day.  I think, right, that day I think I saw just how screwed up and fucked up the music industry  really is because the very next day, the House of, I mean, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  in Cleveland, Ohio, was having a big induction ceremony, you know, and if they had any respect  or they knew anything about modern music, they would have canceled the goddamn thing  and shown Dime the respect and love that he deserved.  He was one of the most influential, awesome guitar players since freaking Jimi Hendrix.  But when he died, it just really seemed to cause an incredible rash of uncreativity and 
[02:15:30]  just really shitty, bad, overly compressed.  I mean, bands like Nickelback, I mean, I know there's always been a lot of crap  music out there, but it's just, like, more so than ever.  But one thing I can say about all the shit music out there is that it certainly makes  us look better, that's for sure.  And one thing, another thing I can't stand are these self-appointed divas, these useless,  my dad works for the studio, you know, surgically augmented, fake-tittied, no-talent bitches 
[02:16:00]  who, like, put out one song with them catterwalling about how much their fucking pussy hurts, and  next thing you know, they've got this big, I'm a diva, I'm a diva, I'm a diva my ass.  I would like nothing better than to see a wild pig chowing down on Christine Aguilera's  disease twat.  That's what I think about music.  It sucks.  There are some good bands out there, and we will be going out with Lamb of God, Job for 
[02:16:30]  a Cowboy, and Red Court on a gigantic tour coming up this fall to pump our new album,  Lost in Space, which is undoubtedly the greatest choir album that we have made since the last  choir album that we did, I guess.  Right, of course.  Now, what happened to the rest of the guys in the band?  Well, like, why are you the last...  I get, I get, you know, basically, they kind of freeze up like a deer in the headlights  when they get on TV and stuff.  They're still a little bit enamored of show business, and I'm just, you might have not 
[02:17:00]  noticed, but I have this thing called diarrhea of the mouth, and actually, diarrhea will start  coming out of my mouth soon.  That's why I have toilet paper installed behind my teeth, so it's like, it's like kind of shitting  and wiping at the same time.  Hopefully that won't happen today.  But what happened to them?  What happened to the other guys, like the original members?  Oh!  They die!  They die!  Or, you know, they have drug overdoses, they're torn apart by dinosaurs, or even, like, in  the case of Joey Slutman, one of our original singers, they go insane and run off down the 
[02:17:30]  street, hurling pieces of armor over their shoulder, only to be run over by a bus.  You know, basically, now that we've solidified Odorous, Beefcake, Ball Shack, Flattus, and  Chismac, and of course, the slaves of GWAR, combining to make an entertainment juggernaut  of Goliath proportion.  And, you know, we're here to get rid of all the crap, play some fucking heavy metal, chop  off some world leaders' heads, core out Lindsay Lohan's diseased twat, and, you know, that's 
[02:18:00]  what we're all, that's how we roll.  That's what you do.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  That looks very inconvenient to be on stage with.  Oh, no, I mean, this is not a fashion statement.  This is, uh, this is protection.  You know, like, I do shows, and the next thing I know, uh, Sawborg Destructo is descended  from the heavens, flown in through the roof, and is trying to saw my scrotum off, you know? 
[02:18:30]  Right, yes.  Rod Stewart never had to deal with that kind of stuff.  No, no, no, he didn't.  Granted, he might have had to deal with having 12 gallons of semen pumped out of his stomach.  Yes, we did hear that.  You know, that might have been my semen, actually.  But, you know, he never had, like, Gorgor chewing on his head, you know?  That's the, a lot of people are like, oh, Gwar, it's just a big act.  All you do is play these, these stupid fucking songs and dress up like monsters from outer  space.  I'm like, yeah, and?  But I will put my band up against any of them.  I defy Harry King from Slayer to play a ripping solo while there is a dinosaur chewing on 
[02:19:00]  his penis.  Yes.  It's kind of, it would be kind of rough.  It is.  I mean, you know, so I dress like this to protect myself from my various enemies, but you will  notice, yes, my dick is hanging out.  It's against the law on my home world to ever cover my phallus.  Wow, why would you want to that?  I know, it's got to breathe.  I've got to, like, slough off the old skin.  It's kind of like a rattlesnake, you know?  Yeah, it's quite disgusting. 
[02:19:30]  What about, what about your audience over the years?  Any changes there?  Yeah, it's really, really interesting.  Gwar started pretty much, the first couple years of Gwar, we were still thawing out.  The music was fairly primitive.  So we got, kind of got our start in the punk rock scene.  Now, as we finally came to room temperature, we got a little more dexterous with our fingers  and we started playing more heavy metal.  We moved into the heavy metal kind of zone, but we took all our fans with us from the 
[02:20:00]  punk rock zone.  Well, now what you've got, after 25 years of this never-ending plateau, that is my career,  we have got whole generations of Gwar fans coming in.  And, like, for instance, last year, it was Gwar dude, his child, and his mother, all wearing  Gwar suits covered in blood, begging for me to blow a filthy disease load of odorous semen  right in their faces.  The old lady was loving it. 
[02:20:30]  So our demographic is slowly spreading, very, very slowly.  Like, most bands, they'll come out, they'll do okay, they'll put out a couple of hit records,  and they'll slowly decline until finally they're playing the state fair.  With Gwar, it's been like a never-ending, slightly inclined plateau.  Every year it gets a little bit bigger.  Now that I'm on your show, I can only think that, like, you know, it's right around the  corner, whatever that is, but for Gwar to finally bust out and do everything that we  know Gwar can do, I mean, it doesn't matter if we get fat or old. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  You know, I'll just paint another six-pack, or I might even have eight-pack abs.  You can paint as many abs as you want on that.  I can, yeah, and I really can't even paint.  So it's family entertainment now, is what you're saying.  Yes, yes, Gwar, it's 25 years of good family entertainment, as long as your family are a  bunch of pig-fucking-sodomites.  That has to get really hot.  No, no, no, no, I mean, when I was born, I was dipped into a pool of lava, so it's just 
[02:21:30]  like, yeah, it doesn't really bug me.  He's got an answer for everything.  And the shoulder, I'm trying to see what they are.  They're like skulls or something.  Oh, okay, cool.  I hear he's a big U2 fan.  Yeah, a lot of people are like, Odorous, why are you such a fag?  And I'm like, I don't know.  Actually, it's a funny story.  U2 actually invited me to a show one time.  They'd seen a copy of Phallus in Wonderland, a movie we actually got nominated for a Grammy. 
[02:22:00]  That was hilarious.  But we got nominated for this fucking Grammy, and U2 wanted to use one of the characters  from the show, from the movie, in their big zoo tour.  Right.  So we went up to D.C., we saw the show, and then they put me in this room to meet with  Bono.  And while I was in the room, all I did was rag on Bono and how fat he looked because he  was cramming his face with tartar sauce-filled donuts the whole show.  Then I looked up and saw the security camera and realized that probably Bono was in the room 
[02:22:30]  right next to me going, that fucking wanker, as he just crammed tartar sauce-filled donuts  into his big, fat, corpulent, child-molesting Irish fuck face.  Can you sing a U2 song for us?  Very angry.  Oh, yeah.  Give us a little song.  Give us some about U2.  In a little while, surely you'll be mine.  In a little while, you'll be there.  That's what he sang to Joey on his deathbed.  In a little while, if you hadn't snorted all that carbonus spot remover, maybe your brain 
[02:23:00]  would still be there.  I'm so fucking rich.  I get pretty annoyed at that band, actually.  Maybe I don't like him that much.  He does tend to do a lot of good for the world.  And I hate that.  For Africa and AIDS.  We don't want to stop AIDS.  There's too many people out there anyway.  I mean, I believe people are like, Odorous, where do you weigh in on health care? 
[02:23:30]  I'm like, let the sick die.  Call the herd.  Yeah, call the freaking herd here.  Come on.  Execution for parking tickets.  This is my idea.  Oh, that would be nice.  Yeah.  Are you an Obama fan?  I don't know.  I guess he's kind of funny.  One thing I have noticed about him is that he's black.  Wow.  That is a big change from the way things usually go.  And I tell you, it's funny.  Like, everyone in America is like, oh, whoa, we got a black president.  I'm like, you fucking dolts. 
[02:24:00]  The whole rest of the world has had black presidents, female presidents, Ecuadorian.  I believe the president of Ecuador is a black Ecuadorian woman or something like that.  It's like, it's not exactly a groundbreaking decision.  But, you know, I must say, everyone's starting to rag on Obama right now.  He's starting to look positively harried.  I just want everyone to remember Bill Clinton's first year when he was doing that whole gaze  in the military thing.  Yeah.  He's off to a shaky start.  But give him a break.  We absolutely, you know, it's just like so funny to me the way the conservatives are just 
[02:24:30]  piling on.  And they're like, as soon as he does anything, they're like, oh, he's fucking up.  Oh, everybody hates him.  Oh, it's a disaster.  Oh, no.  We need to get Rush Limbaugh in here immediately.  Rush, get your face out of that trail of Oxycontin.  We're talking to a monster.  We really are.  It's very frightening.  And it's a big fan of Obama.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He likes the Obama.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mind him.  I mean, I've never met him.  So, I don't know.  I don't think he wants to meet me. 
[02:25:00]  I love it because his hand is always in my fucking pocket.  Yeah.  Did you see him kill that fly?  Yeah.  That was pretty, I mean.  You liked that?  I liked that.  Yeah.  I'm not really interested in swatting flies, but I thought that was pretty cool.  I thought it was a good start.  Good start.  Now we need you to kill something else.  Barack.  Are those worms coming out of your face?  Yes, they're worms.  And I'll tell you one thing about my worms, they're high.  Yeah?  Yeah, they're high.  I'm really, like, I'm not on drugs, like, right now. 
[02:25:30]  But, yeah, from when I was before, they are.  And if I wanted to catch, if you wanted to catch a little buzz here, we could throw one in the bong.  Wow.  They would light up and kill a little bong.  Not really very well.  I was thinking it would be more like we could just drink the bong water.  That's kind of handy to have.  And you're very, like, masculine looking, aside from the fishnet stockings that you're wearing.  What is that?  That's just a peek into my artistic soul.  I mean, I'm not afraid to dress up like a woman.  Show your feminine side. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not afraid to tell people that I have a vagina instead of a butthole.  And I crap out of it.  Out of the back or you have a vagina?  I got a vagina butthole.  Yeah.  It kind of does double duty, if you will.  Double duty.  Yeah.  I heard a great joke the other day.  You might have heard this one.  Two guys are walking down the street, pinging shits on this dude.  He says to his friend, hey, give me a piece of toilet paper.  His friend says, why?  It's already a half a mile away. 
[02:26:30]  You're a monster, but he's telling jokes.  I'm a funny monster.  Man, they seem to like me over at Fox.  Everyone was coming in last night and sucking on my cock.  Oh, I just love you.  What were they talking about last night?  I couldn't really tell because my dick was so buried in their mouths.  But, no, Greg and I are great buddies.  Greg Gutfeld, the host of Red Eye.  He used to be a Maxim editor.  He used to do stuff.  He's got a really hot wife from Russia. 
[02:27:00]  And he's a huge Guar fan.  He's the guy that got Guar on Fox.  And I think it's really, really, really cool.  Yeah, I'm doing Red Eye tonight.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  They're great people over there.  They're a pisser, man.  They are a lot of fun.  They are a lot of fun.  It's funny because Guar is such a proven commodity.  We have so many fans.  We've always been the very cutting edge of the underground metal scene.  But we really have never gotten to that super big level that we deserve to be.  I mean, I want to see Guar movies.  I want to see Guar video games. 
[02:27:30]  I want to see Guar really get everything that we deserve, and for our fans especially.  And things like Red Eye really help.  And things like being on this show, of course, guys, is a big help for Guar.  And it's very awesome that we're here today.  Maybe Guar endorsing things like Campbell's Soup and stuff like that.  You could be on a soup commercial.  Actually, I've just signed a contract with the Defense Department,  and I am endorsing a new cluster bomb.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's a really good one.  It's designed to kill children.  Basically, what happens is, like, when you drop it, it scatters presents everywhere, and they explode. 
[02:28:00]  Hey, what do you think of Michael Jackson?  They're burying him today.  Oh, it's a tragedy.  It's a tragedy.  It's a tragedy, yeah.  But I can tell everyone, you know, it would be a tragedy if Michael Jackson was indeed dead.  But I have inside information that he staged his own death  and is at this moment in Antarctica with the rest of Guar getting ready to make a triumphant return to the stage this fall on the Guar tour. 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  So I would go to every Guar show then.  You bet.  We're going to be moonwalking, and we're going to be shooting drugs into our neck.  We're going to find out if that nose is real, and if there's a hole there, I'm going to stick my dick in it, or at least the very front part of it.  Yeah.  The cuttlefish.  The cuttlefish with my deadly slit slut.  I just came up with that slit slut.  Well, that thing shoot jizz today or what? 
[02:29:00]  No, it's not.  I'm sorry, guys.  He doesn't have any jizz.  I have to start masturbating at least a week in advance in order to get my nut.  I could run it downstairs and maybe have a bus run over it a few times.  There you go.  Don't you have any fat, ugly Korean women around here?  That might work.  With back pimples and knee hair.  You're going to scare that woman.  Yeah, women are afraid of me.  They can't handle my girth and my fake six-pack. 
[02:29:30]  She ran away.  My fake six-pack.  We love the fake six-pack.  Is there a woman in your life?  Well, Odorous is a confirmed bachelor.  But that doesn't mean there's not a woman in my life.  There are all kinds of women.  I like to think of it more like Odorous is more like in their lives.  Like my dick is in their butt, kind of.  I've got some girlfriends and this and that.  Actually, my current girlfriend is a dead dog. 
[02:30:00]  That's handy, actually.  Yeah, Pookie the Wonder Dog.  That's the first song.  We were hanging out with Phil from Pantera.  And someone asked him about Gward.  And he's like, man, Gward, man, they suck, man.  Man, they got a song called, I'm in love with a dead dog.  Man.  What's a great day for a song?  I don't get it.  A lot of jealousy out there.  Yeah, between Adam Carolla and Phil and who else? 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  That bitch who got her teeth knocked out and her fingertips chopped off.  You know?  The model?  Yeah.  She had a nice wreck.  I think they identified her by her implants.  They did.  By the serial number on her implant.  Yeah.  They identified her for real.  Are you shitting me?  Nope.  That came out yesterday.  Wow.  He is right.  She was kind of weird looking.  She had that kind of hot look, but kind of inbred at the same time. 
[02:31:00]  Not wrong with that, though.  No, no.  I'm supporting inbreeding, definitely.  I was looking at a picture of somebody who I guess says they're you.  Some guy named Dave.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's so annoying.  He really doesn't look like somebody that would...  He's an asshole.  He goes around everywhere telling people that he's me.  Yeah.  Yeah, and if I could ever get in the same room as that motherfucker, I'd choke the life out 
[02:31:30]  of him.  Brockie, you better watch out.  Odenus is after you.  See, that just looks like a normal dude.  It looks like a...  It looks like...  What a queer...  What is he?  Got a thing of baked beans with him?  Yeah.  Look at him.  He's on the computer with his laptop.  See, I'm looking at a guy.  It just looks like a normal dude you'd hang out with, have a few beers.  He looks gay to me.  He doesn't look normal at all.  But that's you.  No, it's not.  I don't believe you.  I don't believe you.  Hi, honey.  Hot chicks are here.  Oh, look.  They're walking right by not even really looking. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, they don't want to.  If they look, they'll be hooked.  One look, you're hooked.  My dick is up your butt.  So what?  I guess a lot of guys coming to the shows, mostly.  Yes, a lot of gay men love Guar because of my long-standing tradition of actually orally servicing my fans after the show.  That's nice.  A lot of bands won't give their fans suck jobs, but that's always been a thing that Guar did for people.  And I want everyone out there to know that if you want to come back after the show, stand out by the trash dumpster in a puddle of puke and get your dick sucked by odorous shirungus. 
[02:32:30]  I don't care if it's covered in scabs and herpes.  I don't even care if you come or not.  I just want your dick in my mouth.  That's a lot of cocks, too.  A lot.  Yeah.  The audience likes getting involved in the shows, too.  Oh, yeah.  This is a big thing for Guar.  Getting eaten by the monster is like fucking, you know.  Oh, yeah.  We're nothing without our fans.  There's just something about Guar that kind of makes everybody equal.  Like when you're spraying your pus and your phlegm and your guitar and your bile. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, and your blood.  Blood, yes.  Like after the first song, everybody is like bright red.  So it kind of like is a way of breaking down society's barriers.  That's the way I like to look at it.  You know something?  I never would have looked at that.  But it's true.  It really levels the playing field when everyone is covered with syphilitic semen.  Yeah, syphilitic.  It certainly does.  Are we hitting it off?  I think we're doing all right.  Awesome.  I think you're all right, man.  I understand you had my buddy Al Jugginson up here one time. 
[02:33:30]  That fucking guy can tell a story.  Oh, I got a good Al Jugginson story.  First time we met Al, he was working for us on Scum Dogs of the Universe.  And, you know, Guar was sitting there in the studio.  All of a sudden heard this motorcycle.  And all of a sudden the door to the control room smashed open.  Al drove his motorcycle into the control room, wrecked it into the wall, got off the fucking thing, went over to the console, laid out a mirror, spelt the word Fugazi in cocaine, and then snorted the entire thing. 
[02:34:00]  He didn't even leave me an eye.  Then he went on to work for three days straight mixing one song after which he passed out underneath the console.  Now that is a professional.  That's rock.  Didn't he fuck an ostrich?  That was the story he told on our show, right?  Something like fucking an ostrich, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they broke into the zoo in Amsterdam and one of his dudes fucked an ostrich.  Yeah, yeah.  Love that.  Love that.  But see, the thing is, what they didn't understand is that in Amsterdam there's no need to break into the zoo to fuck an ostrich. 
[02:34:30]  No, you could probably do it right there on the street.  Yeah, I mean, there's a whole street dedicated to it.  We got a lot of GWAR fans on the phones, and I don't know if we're going to be able to get headphones on that ridiculous head of yours.  Well, you could just, yeah, they blow up.  But we got Josh from Virginia.  He wants to know why you guys, GWAR, were banned in Richmond, Virginia.  Well, what happened was it was something to do with my dick hanging out.  And this is what happens over and over again. 
[02:35:00]  People don't buy, the police will not buy the defense that it's a fish.  That's what we stuck with for many.  My lawyer actually said to say it's a fish.  And that worked for a while.  I was arrested in North Carolina for the dissemination of obscenity back in the 90s.  And we actually had to go to trial for this thing.  And I shit you not, the judge's name, this has nothing to do with the question, but it's just funny.  The judge's name was Richard Boner.  Yeah, and on the, and I'm not kidding, on the docket behind me that day in court was a gang of criminal circus midgets. 
[02:35:30]  So my dick has brought me a lot of places.  We were not really banned in Richmond.  What happened was everyone was just terrified to do a show.  Because what typically happens is the ABC is always trying to shut down clubs for some ridiculous reason.  I mean, they're supposed to be the alcoholic beverage thing.  They're supposed to help people get drunk.  Right.  But anyway, so they basically used Guar as an excuse to shut down some clubs that they wanted to shut down. 
[02:36:00]  So for about three or four years we didn't get to play in Richmond, but it wasn't much of a ban.  We just started, after a while we were just like, you know, maybe we should just start playing and see what happens.  And, you know, nobody arrested us, so we're good again.  We got actually banned from Canada for like nine years.  And the way they did that is they just, they lied to us about where it was.  And we just couldn't find a fucking place.  And that's pretty bad.  I mean, Canada's pretty big.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Footer.  And Footer's on the phone.  He's a regular to the show. 
[02:36:30]  And, uh, Footer, you might be able to hear through the headphones over there.  What's up, boys?  What's up, Footer?  Real quick, yeah, I went to a Guar show.  It was a fucking while ago, probably like, uh, probably eight years ago.  And one of the chicks that you used to feed to your fucking monster, I ended up fucking banging her and her girlfriend for like the entire weekend afterwards.  So thanks to Guar and their disgusting show, bang, a threesome.  Nice.  Yeah, that's great.  We actually, we had a thing, uh, it's called the World Maggot.  This giant worm that lives under the drums. 
[02:37:00]  And, uh, we would sacrifice women to it.  And the sex-e-cutioner would, uh, would help them through there.  But, uh, it was really funny.  He would, like, he was such a pervert.  He would, like, get inside of it.  And as the girls were, like, being passed to the back of the stage, he would basically, like, molest them underneath the drum rocks.  We would see these chicks come staggering out, you know, comb-glazed and dizzy.  Uh, they'd have to crawl through this maggot.  Yeah, and there was, like, a dude, there was, like, a dude inside there waiting for him with his dick hanging out, saying, basically, you're never gonna get out of here unless you blow me. 
[02:37:30]  That's perfect.  Oh, yeah, we're pretty good.  Oh, fucking A.  We're pretty good.  That's just like going to a U, uh, a U2 show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking A, man.  That actually, I could actually hear him.  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Odorous.  What's your price of sight?  He's singing 80s music.  Odorous.  Anyway, just while everyone is laughing, I just want to take this opportunity to plug Gwar's new album, Lust in Space. 
[02:38:00]  We debuted on the top 100 for the first time, debuting at 96.  We won't stop until we get all the way to 94.  Hey, we can play a song off the new Gwar album.  What do you want to hear?  Let Us Slay?  Yeah.  We just did a video for this.  Yeah.  And I have no idea what it's gonna look like, but I'm pretty sure that I'm in it. 
[02:38:30]  I should hope so.  All right.  Should we say goodbye to Odorous?  Yeah, get rid of me.  I'm about done with this shit.  Well, we're gonna play the song now.  Oh, okay.  Fine.  What?  Hey, it's your guy's show.  I'll stay all day.  I think this was a perfect first appearance.  Yeah.  I want you to leave with them wanting more.  Do you think that maybe they can come back with me?  How long have you been trying to get on our show?  I know we've said no.  Probably a month. 
[02:39:00]  A month, a month, a year, maybe.  I don't know.  But all I can say is, you know, you guys let us on unlike some people named Howard Stern.  Well, he misses out there.  I know.  I mean, am I not erudite, sensual?  Yes.  My voice has almost a caramello quality.  Yes.  It's very, very good.  He sounds like Ozone from the old days, man.  He also sounds like Jesse Ventura.  Yeah.  I think I want the Jewish thing.  I can talk like an old dandified fop.  And I can also rock the New York shit. 
[02:39:30]  I'm basically completely schizophrenic.  I'll be whatever you want, except sober.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would try to stay drunk on my coffee, I say.  Yeah.  All right.  Let us slay.  It's the latest song from Gwar's new album.  What is it?  Lust in Space?  Lust in Space is out now on Metal Blade Records!  I want to thank Odorous for stopping by today.  Hey, it's been great.  I'm going to close to my next appearance.  Wow.  You don't know when an out is an out, huh? 
[02:40:00]  Jesus.  What were you going to say, Odorous?  I just, I don't know.  I just, I really appreciate you guys having us on the show.  You made a lot of Gwar fans very happy today.  And hopefully be seeing you guys in the future.  You keep saying thanks for having us, but you're the only one in the studio.  I know.  I'm a little confused by that.  Like, I'm completely multiple personality.  He's probably in contact with the rest of the guys.  Oh, yeah.  They're big fans.  They're very jealous they're not here right now.  But, yeah, I always speak in the collective.  The collective that is the mighty Gwar.  All right.  You want to set up this song?  Give it the big intro. 
[02:40:30]  The big over the top.  Let Us Slay is a song all about the human's desire to embrace war as a natural means of population control.  It addresses the basic hypocrisy of existence.  The Ten Commandments say thou shalt not kill, yet George Bush will fry 20 people this week,  even though he's not the president anymore.  Anyway, it's basically saying war is great.  Let Us Slay.  He didn't do that as president.  He killed all kinds of people, didn't he?  Oh, yeah.  Well, all right.  I was thinking the death penalty. 
[02:41:00]  You're right.  You're right.  If they're worried about the death penalty here, they should try Saudi Arabia.  They behead you and publicly crucify you.  Yeah.  But you have to be Nigerian.  Odorous, a pleasure, man.  Thank you, guys.  In the last segment, a caller actually requested this.  How's it going, guys?  My name is Greg, and I want to request the bit where you guys interviewed Odorous from GWAR.  Thanks a lot.  Continuing on with that bit, here's part two.  Instant feedback. 
[02:41:30]  They're all checking out your tweet.  Yes, I just tweeted.  Odorous has just left the studio from GWAR.  And I think he had a fine first appearance.  I liked it a lot.  Yes.  A very funny monster.  In stores now.  But he got up off the chair, and, well, his sweaty ass pretty much destroyed one of the  Opie and Anthony chairs in the studio.  We didn't notice that, because he was sitting down, in his fishnet stockings.  When he got up to leave and turned around, you just saw his ass.  His ass is bare.  It's just a bare ass. 
[02:42:00]  And it was sweating profusely, because that chair now has odorous, sweat-ass stains.  Ass sweat.  Ass sweat.  He doesn't look as manly when he's walking away from you.  No, no, no.  Not as frightening monster alike.  No, no, no, no.  We should have somebody sniff the sweaty chair.  Well, where's Iraq?  Where's Iraq?  Iraq hasn't done shit for us lately.  Oh, Iraq!  Ow!  Iraq!  Iraq!  Iraq, sniff odorous's chair. 
[02:42:30]  Tell us what the sweaty, odorous chair smells like.  Now, look at the imprint and see right where the bong would have been.  Yeah, pick a good spot on the chair, will you?  Right where his coolie hole would be.  Okay.  And give it a good sniff.  Just smells like damp.  Not bad.  Wow, how about that?  Odorous isn't very odorous.  No, not really.  It's like a potpourri to you, huh?  No, but it's all wet. 
[02:43:00]  I just put my hand here on the back.  It's all on the back of the chair.  The chair is soaked.  I was saying, like, wear that fucking costume, dude.  Come on.  Under the lights of a stage?  He must be sweating like a pig.  Yeah, I think so.  How does he not have abs?  You like the odorous interview there, Iraq?  Yeah.  Not really a GWAR fan, but he was very entertaining.  Yeah.  I know a few GWAR fans.  The GWAR fans are like, about time, fuckers.  All right.  All right.  Relax.  What do you want from us?  We didn't know he could do good radio.  Is this the guy that was just in the suit? 
[02:43:30]  Is that him?  Open the door.  Who's that?  Open the door.  I want to get him on the air.  This is definitely the guy, but he will not play it that way.  Get him in the studio.  Get him in the studio for a second.  Is that him?  Hey, who's this guy?  Hey, who are you, man?  What's up?  Guys, did you see that odorous dude in here?  Yeah.  That dude is fucked up.  I barely got out of here.  I barely managed to sneak in.  He's leaving now.  I think I'm safe.  Yeah.  I think you're okay. 
[02:44:00]  Wait.  So you're not the guy?  That's my story.  I'm sticking to it.  No, I'm just a regular old Dave Brockie.  I've been a Slave Pit artist.  Slave Pit is the production company that came up with Guar and has supported it and loved  it and nurtured it and cherished it for 25 years now.  And this is the 25th year our freaking business has been scratching an existence out of a hostile  world.  Well, you've been working with Guar for 25 years.  Yeah.  And odorous, right? 
[02:44:30]  As odorous, yes.  I would imagine at this point you know how to impersonate him.  Yeah, we were looking at your slitty stare.  That is really gross.  That got twittered, by the way.  And I just sit right back down.  Yeah, on red eye, apparently I left a really bad stain on the chair.  And then the guests behind me came on.  They're like, your thongs left this stain on there.  And this chick sat on it and just immediately ruined her dress or something.  Probably impregnated her, too.  We've always managed to get ourselves in a lot of trouble. 
[02:45:00]  I remember one of the first times I came up to New York.  Because we come from Richmond, Virginia.  It's a really small, kind of backwards little southern town.  Roadrunner Records flew me up here.  And we were going to go talk to Roadrunner about getting this thing.  So we decided we would wear our costumes to the meeting.  And it really impressed them.  So we put the costumes on.  We put blood all over us.  We came in through the lobby.  Everyone was like, oh, my God.  We walked upstairs to Roadrunner and then sat down on a brand new office suite of white leather couches. 
[02:45:30]  And destroyed them.  And the meeting was just over.  And we couldn't understand.  We're like, what?  What happened?  Just because you ruined their fucking couch?  Just because we ruined their couches, yeah.  Also, we wouldn't sign a seven-record deal.  I think that had something to do with it as well.  Where you get nothing until the eighth record.  We hung in there really well.  When we came out with GWAR, we didn't want to sign a big, long contract.  Because we just saw it happening over and over again.  Bands would sign five to seven record deals.  And after two records, the labels would give up on these bands. 
[02:46:00]  You're still under contract.  Yeah, they would shelve them.  And we're just like, we're not going to do that.  So the first two records we did were one-offs.  And we had a lot of really interesting experiences.  We went to this company called Master from England.  And they gave us a lot of money for one record.  And then all of a sudden, they just disappeared.  Like, their office was empty.  And they weren't picking up the phone.  We're like, what's going on?  Then all these distributors started calling us from all over the world.  Like, hey, where's that next GWAR album?  And basically what they've done is they've sold GWAR. 
[02:46:30]  They've licensed two records.  Got all the advances.  Gave us part of it.  Took the rest.  And buggered off to New Zealand.  Wow.  Wow.  Scumbags.  That learned us pretty quick.  But after the first...  Getting fucked in the music business, that's a surprise, right, Ant?  Yeah, that never happened.  That never happens to fans.  Yeah, luckily we've been on...  You know, Metal Blade is a lot like GWAR in that they're survivors.  You know, they've been around forever.  They've always put out good music.  Brian Slagle and Mike Faley and the whole crew over there.  You know, we actually...  We've been with Metal Blade for a long time. 
[02:47:00]  And for some stupid reason, we went with this other label for a little while.  Just because they, like, had some...  They were going to, like, actually, like...  The royalty rate was really good.  We're like, okay, it's not a huge advance, but we're, like, getting 40% royalty.  So let's do this thing.  First album, again, was great.  Then it was like, you're calling the thing up.  It was like, this number has been disconnected.  They had this huge office here in Manhattan that, like, within a couple months, it went  from, like, 12 employees to four employees to one employee doing it out of his apartment.  And so it's just like, yeah, it's just rife. 
[02:47:30]  It's completely rife with scumbags.  And it's overly difficult.  It really is.  The arts and music are so undersupported in this country.  It's kind of a good thing in a way, because the cream does rise to the top.  You have to be good.  You have to be dedicated if you want to get anywhere with it.  But it does put a stifle on a lot of creativity.  But then again, you don't want it to be like Europe, where everyone is getting money from  the government, and they've got this kind of, like, government-funded, pompous attitude. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, I hate the government.  You know?  It's just like, I hate America, and that's why I'm wearing Levi's and Nikes and watching  the Tarantino movie, you know?  God damn.  I talk just as much as Odorous does.  I don't know.  It's great to hear the whole business end of it, though.  It's a fascinating thing.  I've been doing it for so long now, and it's always been so real.  I know that sounds kind of weird, but the artists and the musicians that do GWAR really 
[02:48:30]  do it because they love it, and because we really feel like we're fulfilling a need that  society has to have, you know?  And I've been waiting for somebody to do a more outrageous show than us, but nobody has.  Yeah, no one's really come to the table with that one.  It's all about the comedy with GWAR, you know?  We're not trying, obviously, not taking ourselves too seriously.  And, you know, and people will make that mistake, you know, like, serious metalheads.  Oh, yeah, they're not really from outer space.  I've had people ask me, honestly, like, hey, Odorous, what's the scene like in Antarctica? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, why?  And I'll go, I'll be like, oh, it's pretty bleak, yeah, just some, like, Norwegian scientists  and some penguins, you know?  Pretty bleak.  How did you know you'd be able to breathe here?  All right, scurry off.  But we've been like, you know, GWAR has been, like I say, the never-ending plateau.  It's like we've always been at the cutting edge of performance rock or whatever you want 
[02:49:30]  to call what it is that we do.  In fact, you really can't label it.  It's just GWAR.  But I really do feel GWAR is a band that can last for hundreds of years.  I mean, we will breed replacements for ourselves, and we'll just keep, you know, GWAR has a lot  more to do with Beatlemania than they do with Black Sabbath.  We're a franchise.  We're an idea.  We're not a bunch of boring poser dudes who can't take off their rock and roll persona.  When I'm done with my character, I throw my bloody suit in a costume box, and, you know, 
[02:50:00]  and I'm Dave again.  Yeah.  And that has kept us very real and grounded and close to our fans.  Now, Dave, we talk about that all the time, franchising these bands.  Now, you get a little older, you find the next Odorous.  Pass on your cut.  That's what I'm saying.  You sit home and take a nice cut and let those guys do all the heavy lifting.  Oh, I look forward to that day.  Let me tell you, I do.  But there's bands out there doing pretty much, you know, just that.  They're running out of all their members, but the bang continues on.  Yeah.  You know, that happens all the freaking time. 
[02:50:30]  And with GWAR, we're particularly made to take advantage of that.  And I've always just thought GWAR would just be like a relentless assault.  It doesn't matter if you haven't done a GWAR movie or a GWAR video game or even gotten  to Japan yet.  You're going to one day because it's just...  Wait, you guys haven't played Japan?  No, we've never been to Japan.  We've actually had things...  You know, the biggest problem with getting to Japan is it's just really expensive.  We have to fill a shipping container full of, you know, a rubber dinosaur and all this  crap, you know? 
[02:51:00]  It's not like I can just go pick up an Odorous costume in downtown Tokyo.  You could probably get pretty close to it, but...  It's like a samurai thing with a...  Well, also, remember that I was telling you guys about the deal with the company that  sold fake rights?  Yeah, it turned out...  We got this letter from Jimco, which is a label in Japan.  They're like, we look forward to a new GWAR album and big sales.  We hope to bring them.  I always thought that had something to do with the reason we never got back to Japan.  Like, I'm sorry about that.  But it's like sooner or later, it's going to crack. 
[02:51:30]  You know, people are just going to freaking say, you know what?  GWAR is just not going to stop.  The guys that work for GWAR, the guys that I'm lucky enough to have hooked up with, you  know, they're just...  I mean, it's like...  We got to the point that we really couldn't do anything else.  This is what we do, you know?  And I think GWAR will go just as long as it's still funny.  It's like, Jesus Christ, they're not fucking going away.  They're not going to go away.  They're not going away.  You might as well let them in.  You know, give them a TV show. 
[02:52:00]  Give them a video game.  Send them to freaking Mongolia if they want.  Anyway, just get them out of America.  Even people who have never heard GWAR have heard of GWAR, which is pretty amazing, you  know?  And we were just talking about it.  The whole Beavis and Butthead thing was really funny, how they just love to get them.  GWAR!  GWAR!  GWAR!  That was great.  That was like one of the first kind of big things that happened to us.  I remember we were like, when we found out that my judge wanted to do that, we were  like, well, this is great.  We actually are going to get some money out of this somehow.  And Viacom was like, no, we don't really do that. 
[02:52:30]  We're like, oh, come on, come on, come on.  We've got to get some money.  They're like, well, come on up to New York and we'll talk about it.  So we came up to New York, went in there with our lawyer, and they're like, yeah, we're  going to give you some money.  We're going to give you 0.0006% after we sell 200,000 copies.  And here's also a free copy of the video game.  Oh, okay.  And we were just like, that was like music business 101 right there.  Unbelievable. 
[02:53:00]  I still have a shrink wrap copy of that game, though.  And that game was ridiculously difficult to play.  What it was is like Beavis the Butthead were going to see Guar and their dog had eaten their  tickets and then barfed little bits of the tickets all over town.  And you had to find the tickets.  And apparently, like, I've only talked to a few.  Actually, John from Adrenaline, I think, actually did finish that game.  That's just very cool.  I was just coming down here to take a piss.  I wasn't really trying to get back on the show, but that's cool.  We're in the middle of a commercial.  Yeah, we've got to get back to the commercial read.  But, David, thank you. 
[02:53:30]  Thank you very much for having me.  I had a blast.  Now that we've seen you out of the suit, though, I don't know if we could ever have you back.  We'll think about it.  No, you'll be back.  Hell yeah, yeah.  You had a great appearance.  Thank you, David.  Thank you, man.  Had a blast.  David, a.k.a.  Odorous from Guar.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hey, this is Will from Texas, and I'd like to request the bit about when Ron and Fezz are  hypnotized at the ONA game.  It's been funny shit.  Check it out.  Message deleted. 
[02:54:00]  The all-request.  Worst of, worst, worst, worst of show.  Ron and Fezz do a hypnotist show.  I'm trying to teach to these guys.  I just don't have time to teach anymore.  They do a hypnotist show, right, Jimmy?  It was brilliant.  Ronnie did an amazing job.  Of course he did.  As the leader of the band there.  And one of the segments that went about 15 minutes was everybody acting like they were  doing the opening Anthony show.  You want to play the first track?  How long is it, Butch?  Uh, much. 
[02:54:30]  All right, cool.  So Ron and Fezz did a hypnotist show.  Anthony, in general, doesn't like hypnotist shows, but I heard you call Ron and give a  him props on the show.  Give him props on that.  I had a goof on Dave a little bit because he was doing, uh, he was hypnotized as me,  apparently.  Right.  Uh, it was very funny.  I hear Dave was, um, a little, uh, Dave gets a little crazy and I, I think he was nervous  that I was upset with his impression of me.  Right.  And of course not.  He'd be, he's a silly, silly man, Dave.  But I, I heard he was, uh, upset that he thought I was upset with his, uh, little rendition 
[02:55:00]  of me.  No.  I thought it was great.  All right.  So, uh, Jimmy, you missed it too on Friday.  Uh, Ron and Fezz, uh, hypnotized a bunch of the guys.  Who, who do we got in here?  We got Eastside Dave playing you.  Yeah.  We got Fezzy playing me.  And who was playing Jimmy?  Oh my God.  Who was that?  We're going to have to listen.  I, that, I don't really know any other members of the, uh, Ron and Fezz show.  Any of the interns and stuff.  I don't know.  Oh, geez.  So, as, uh, the guys are hypnotized, here they go. 
[02:55:30]  Here's, uh, them doing the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's a, uh, Ron and Fezz show, but we are about to join the O.N.A. show already in progress.  One, two, and three.  Welcome back to the O.N.A. show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across the country.  Lingalanga.  Lingalanga.  In the house with O.N.A.  And today, little Jimmy Norton. 
[02:56:00]  Jimmy, where are you going to be appearing?  The, uh, punchline at the Gypsy.  At this dot com, it's at Jim Norton.  Make sure you check that out.  Coming into the studio.  I don't know.  She's a penthouse pet.  She is our resident sexpert, Dr. Z.  Dr. Z, welcome back.  It's a pleasure to be here.  All right.  Dr. Z, what's on your mind today?  I'm here to talk about my new book. 
[02:56:30]  I'm kidding.  Go ahead.  In my new book, I will tell you exactly how to get women who are as hot as I am and any  man.  I'm already there.  I don't need your book.  Well, I do hear good things about you.  Hickory dickory, doc.  This cod.  This guest sucks cock.  Oh.  What women are looking for is a penis.  We want a man with a penis. 
[02:57:00]  Please, I'm just trying to tell you.  Just sat out shopping.  Tell this bitch.  Okay, okay, okay.  Tell this hole to shut the fuck up.  All right.  Okay, okay, okay.  Dr. Z, she's going to be hanging out this weekend at M.H. Riley's in Huntington Village,  Long Island.  I'm Brokenjaw here.  Tell his guest to get the shit out of the studio.  She's a fucking hole.  All right.  It's mind-boggling why we wouldn't have this ready to go. 
[02:57:30]  Seriously, this is like.  That's hysterical.  I can't believe Eastside Dave picked up on the fact that Ant does all right.  But someone was commenting on the message board, a few people, that I don't do that much  anymore.  Not as much as you said.  That's old school Anthony.  I noticed that, too.  They were doing the Opie and Anthony show from maybe a year ago.  Yeah, like a year ago.  I think they've adjusted slightly in the last year, and they've picked up on a lot of this.  Yes, Jimmy.  First of all, I don't like the fact that whoever's doing me is fucking eight feet off Mike. 
[02:58:00]  I get it.  And I don't like the fact that he's only doing my catchphrases.  Like, that's all I do.  Well, that, too.  And Dave was only doing, like, bad impressions.  Ronnie later on said something like, hey, Anthony, how does it feel to listen to you if  you had absolutely no talent whatsoever or material?  And then they also picked up on the fact that all of our equipment's always busted.  Want to hear more of this?  Yeah, of course. 
[02:58:30]  It was entertaining.  I would love to.  The guys hypnotized, and Ronnie had them doing the Opie and Anthony show.  I got an idea.  We get Big A and Stalker Patty in here, and they just shit all over the floor.  And then we just have, you know, we have, like, naked girls coming in here to roll around  in it for cash.  We hide cash in the shit.  We hide cash in the shit.  I swear, if fucking Elo tells us we can't do this again, I swear, there's going to be 
[02:59:00]  hell to pay.  Oh, boy.  It's unsanitary.  There's going to be hell to pay if we can't do the O and A shit roll.  Someone tell Steve my computer's down.  I don't know how to do a show with a computer down.  I don't know how to fix anything.  Look at baby girls showing it off.  Fuck that stuff.  All right.  Those are quite lovely.  She was definitely blessed.  Are they real?  Do you know?  They are indeed, ma'am.  As my ex-wife's grandmother said, can I have some more boxed wine? 
[02:59:30]  Can I?  No, right, dance.  No, right, dance.  All right.  I'm thinking none of this is helping your question for a new vagina.  I just want to fight your face off.  Jimmy?  Jimmy, tell everyone where you're playing this weekend.  I'll be at Bananas and Poughkeepsie.  I'll be at Face Off.  I'll be at Jim Norton.  And that's where we can come see our comedy?  If you want to fall in a pool of AIDS.  Now, who are you putting your penis in currently? 
[03:00:00]  Oh, that bastard.  He got it.  Oh, is that funny?  It's a funnel, you dope.  Not pool.  I like Dave, too.  Someone tell Steve my computer's broken.  I don't know how to do a show without a computer.  The other thing he said Dave picked up on was me ranting and, like, if Elo says no  and you getting nervous, like, I'm fucking up our jobs.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Dave does a bang-up job of imitating me.  That's funny. 
[03:00:30]  Do we have more?  I think we have more if you want to hear it, Jimmy.  It's fucking fantastic.  Once again, you're listening to the gang from the Rana Fez show, hypnotized, doing the Opie  and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Dr. Z, you're the sexpert.  What wrestler do you think E-Rock would want to have sex with the most?  Hello, Ronald Reagan here.  I forgot how bad E-Rock sucks.  Well, to be honest, I'm not really that familiar with wrestling.  Nancy's head is like a Pez dispenser. 
[03:01:00]  They didn't have wrestling in the country that I was raised in.  E-Rock's the big fucking fat sumo wrestler who can't get through the door right now.  E-Rock's got a bit of a belly, all right?  Well, as long as he has a...  We made him do a chubby bunny.  If he has a less than average...  They should have called it a chubby faggot, all right?  Anthony, if he has a less than average or mid-range penis, he will get a woman.  I'm not too worried about him.  What's the best thing guys can do to get women?  Have a penis. 
[03:01:30]  Looks like your hole is pretty goddamn big, huh, Doc?  All right.  I'll have you know that I've had sex with over 100 people.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy, where was the car crash sound effect for that one, Jimmy?  I had to give myself a triple there, Jimmy.  Oh, what a motherfucker.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, it really is, man.  Those bastards nailed it. 
[03:02:00]  One more clip?  How many we got?  Oh, we got two more.  Once again, you're listening to the boys from Rana Fez,  hypnotized doing our show, the Opie and Anthony show.  Go ahead.  All right, what's your plug?  Hole illustrated.  Jimmy, why don't you plug her book?  Why don't you plug Dr. Z's book for it?  If you want to get a copy of Dr. Z's new book,  just go to eatabullet.com or myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  Raman!  You seem to have a lot of hostility towards women, Jimmy.  Where does this come from? 
[03:02:30]  Having your penis touched by your mother?  I sucked a dick under the porch once.  Tell us a little about that.  I play this game called Monster Rain,  and every time I say, Monster Rain, Monster Rain,  and we'd suck each other off.  You think that's what it is?  It could be.  About how old were you doing this?  Eleven.  Eleven.  So you were well into the prepubescent stages.  I loved dicks in my mouth back then.  On the instant message, Steve from Bay Show  is saying this should be Dr. Z, Z, Z, Z, Z. 
[03:03:00]  Those fucking assholes, they probably weren't even hypnotized.  They were probably just taking shots at us.  They were definitely fucking with us.  One of the Philly crew calls me like,  you listen to Ron and Fez, they're taking shots at you guys.  I'm like, no, man.  These guys are hypnotized.  I hope they're hypnotized. 
[03:03:30]  That's fantastic.  It's funny, man.  One more clip.  We've got to take another break.  Coming up, we will have Patrice O'Neal.  We will have Robert Kelly, Rich Voss stopping by.  All coming up.  My keyboard is still not working, Steve.  It works around here.  You know, I don't want to stop running with the new TV immediately.  Why would my keyboard work, Opie?  Why would my keyboard work, Opie?  And I don't even think I got blueberries. 
[03:04:00]  I think I got strawberries.  Where are those blueberries?  Blueberries.  Blueberries.  We'll be right back.  It's the ONA Show.  Fucking asshole.  They're right.  We stink.  They're great.  That's so goddamn funny.  Nothing but shit games and fucking bad chick fucking games.  All right.  All right.  The listener request voicemail. 
[03:04:30]  Next message.  It's Royce, John, Ryan, and Marie, and Dutch.  We want to request the Patrice O'Neal cruise ship bit with the rock coat.  Yeah, that was the one where he was saying that it was a lot easier to dump a body, a chick's body, when you dump it over a cruise ship.  I like that bit because we can relate to murdering people on a ship, and we don't own a lot of cruise ships.  Yes.  And you're like women anyway.  Message deleted. 
[03:05:00]  People request the worst of show.  Yeah.  I know what those sailors back in, you know, 01, you know, the Columbus, the Christopher Columbus motherfuckers killed themselves.  There's something calling you to jump in and kill yourself.  Especially back then when there was no, you know, tuxedo night at the dining room.  That's why they have that stuff to take your mind off of killing yourself.  Is that what, all the good stuff, the casino, the shows, the stop at the port so you could go to the beach and see some land. 
[03:05:30]  It's, they know that.  Because if they just leave you out there long enough without any distractions, everyone's jumping overboard.  Paranoia.  I know there's some maritime documents somewhere, yeah, from 1601.  Some oldie time written with a quill, like on brown curled up paper somewhere.  Like in the movie, The Thing, where they find the Russian ship that all the Russians fought the monster and there's the one last survivor who has a tape.  And he's like, listen, don't, ah, ah.  Well, and they have things like that from when people used to do all of them that there's something calling me into the water. 
[03:06:00]  Into the water.  And it's true, man.  I wanted to, it's the weirdest thing.  And that's where these missing people on the cruise ships are.  And we got to get the audio because I was just watching it.  They just showed a montage of guys that are missing.  A whole freaking montage, one after another.  Let's go to Jason in Maryland.  Jason, what's up?  Not too much.  What's up with you guys this morning?  We're all over the place.  We're hanging.  We got lots to do. 
[03:06:30]  Obviously.  The reason I was calling is you guys were talking about the missing guy on that cruise ship with the bloodstain and the Russian mafia and all that shit.  Uh-huh.  I was on that ship.  That guy didn't, he did not commit suicide.  That's for goddamn shit.  How do you know?  Were you hanging out with him at the buffet?  No, I wasn't hanging out with him at the buffet.  But I saw the blood.  And I'm telling you, from the height where that guy's room was to that bloodstain, there's no way just falling could create that amount of blood.  I was on the same ship before it went over to the Mediterranean.  Oh, yeah?  Where this guy was. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, they were.  And they were talking about how the ship was going from the Caribbean, where I was, and that it was going to be dry docked, refitted with some shit.  And then they were going to send it over to the Mediterranean.  And that's the cruise that the guy died on.  So, I know what it looks like off of those upper balconies.  And, yeah, there's no way to get to jump to the water from up there.  You're hitting that overhang that hangs over the lifeboat.  Exactly.  And that seems to be where that big blood smear came from.  Yeah.  He might have jumped, but I think there's too many things that are going on. 
[03:07:30]  Those Russian guys.  And they were everywhere.  That seems to be a little sketchy there.  Two Russian guys.  The woman.  The casino.  Kind of an argument.  They're not going to solve this one.  Yelling.  And then the shit in the room was yelling.  She goes to sleep.  He disappears.  I don't know.  You think he jumped, though, Patrice?  Nah.  This is some foul play.  Definitely some foul play. 
[03:08:00]  You ought to put something on those ships where you can detect when someone goes in the water.  What the fuck?  God.  Get some night vision in the water.  You're done if you fall in that ocean in the middle of that damn Atlantic or wherever you are.  It's just once you're in there.  Done.  It's been a pleasure.  There is such nothingness out there that I couldn't imagine.  If you don't die the second you hit that water, could you imagine bobbing up and down and watching that huge ship just pull away from you? 
[03:08:30]  And the darkness and the utter quiet.  Like you'd hear that ship go away.  And then.  And then you just.  And it is so completely dark.  And you don't hear.  You don't even hear that.  What's that?  Buoy bell.  No.  Ding, ding.  And then just.  No.  Take a couple of.  Seagull.  Nothing.  Because they have nowhere to land out there.  Even with the motor going. 
[03:09:00]  Do you cry?  Like.  Is your flow in there?  Do you just.  I think the fear just kills you.  Just to take a deep breath.  I don't know.  The fear just kills you.  It depends on if you could try to commit suicide or if you fell off.  You fell off.  You are so fucked now.  You're like.  Oh no.  And there's no help.  And that horse shit you see on Love Boat when somebody falls off and there's a.  Ah.  And there's a little.  There's a lifesaver flying.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Julie the cruise director throws your fucking life preserver.  Man overboard.  There's no fucking man. 
[03:09:30]  If I jumped over when I.  When I.  When the sirens were calling me on that ship.  Yeah.  It would have just been a.  A.  Plunk.  Yeah.  Nobody except for somebody that was thinking about killing himself too.  Yeah.  Saw me jump.  Look at that.  Oh shit.  Somebody.  I ain't doing this shit.  Yeah.  That's why I jumped off the pole.  If you.  If you meant to kill yourself.  You still got your crazy head on.  So you're probably gonna.  Just try to drown.  Whatever.  If you fell overboard. 
[03:10:00]  I think the first thing that goes through your head is.  What time is it.  Who knows.  Like in a split second.  What time is it.  Who knows I'm missing.  How long is it gonna take for people to think.  As that thing is just.  Going away.  You're probably thinking.  How long is it gonna be.  Before they realize I'm missing.  That cruise ship.  And turn this thing around.  And they're not gonna turn.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  For you.  No.  That is collateral damage.  They'll just call the coast guard.  Yeah.  Well our fuel supply just lets us get into a.  We got a tight schedule. 
[03:10:30]  Oh.  And you got to find them in the ocean.  Yeah.  Yeah right.  And you got to.  And you got to get coordinates of where you might be.  Done.  And then where you floated because all those.  They should hand out little GPS badges to everybody in that case.  Now that's an idea.  There's an idea.  Little GPS.  We got the audio of the story here.  You know once you board a cruise ship.  You really are in the hands of the cruise ship company.  Whoops.  But if.  Whoops.  If something goes wrong.  What happens?  Who's responsible?  Well that is the subject of that special hearing.  On Congress.  On Capitol Hill this afternoon.  I can't talk. 
[03:11:00]  And it comes just.  After another cruise ship.  The Canadian's jewel of the sea.  This passenger.  When it departed.  A Canadian.  59 year old Jill Begora.  Was last seen by her husband on Saturday morning.  As the ship approached the port of Nassau.  In the Bahamas.  A search by a U.S. Coast Guard ship.  And the Bahamian Navy.  Found no trace of her.  Bahamian Navy.  Her family.  Just wants to know.  What happened.  It's just.  Too much to comprehend. 
[03:11:30]  You know.  Um.  I hope everything's alright.  But.  You know.  Those things are sometimes.  You hope everything's alright.  Are you.  Insane.  You're hoping everything.  Like she's going to turn up.  Oh I was.  I was just taking a swim.  Yeah.  I like swimming.  Then you just ask a question.  Mike.  Um.  What's.  The percentage of when people are missing on these boats.  What's the percentage that you find them about?  That actually come back.  And.  0.0001. 
[03:12:00]  They might have found one.  Can you please find them.  The one guy who lives.  Some guy lost.  Lost in the place where they keep like the vegetables.  Yeah.  Way in the hold.  Somewhere in the bilge.  That's it.  It's Tom.  It's Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  I was looking for the.  Uh.  I was looking for the pool deck.  No.  Some ass.  And I ended up down here.  Where the fucking.  Some ass that forgot to take his medicine.  Ends up in a meat locker somewhere.  Somewhere locked in a meat locker.  They never find you.  That chick man.  That was probably a bad marriage. 
[03:12:30]  And the guy figured out a way to get out of it.  Oh you think.  Cause that's probably it.  Either you're killing yourself.  Or someone is killing you.  There's gotta be people that plan it out.  And go look.  We'll be on a cruise ship.  Yeah.  A little.  A slight push.  And I'm.  A little drink.  Maybe slip her a little Mickey.  And then.  Give her the heave ho.  They'll never find her.  To do toxicology.  What goes through your mind.  To give your loved one.  Cause there was a time.  You loved this person.  What goes through your head.  As you're giving her the heave ho. 
[03:13:00]  Not even the heave ho.  What goes through your mind.  When you're.  Cause you're already committed at the heave ho.  Right.  What goes through your mind.  When you're like.  Honey.  We're going on a cruise.  Like.  And you hold the tickets up.  Knowing.  I'm gonna kill this fucking bitch.  The ticket wave.  Yeah.  The ticket wave.  You got both of them in your hand.  You're waving them like a fan.  Baby.  We're going on a cruise.  And you know it's gonna end with a heave ho.  The heave ho.  Is somewhere in that.  The heave ho.  Itinerary.  Do you talk her into.  We got.  Nassau.  Right.  All right.  And then we're going to St. Martin. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  And then heave ho.  Right.  And.  Between Miami and.  Nassau.  I'm doing the heave ho.  Heave ho.  And do you make sure she wears a special outfit.  So you can hold on to the outfit better.  To get.  I think.  Give yourself some leverage.  I think nude.  I think you gotta plan where your room is.  You want your room at the back of the ship.  Right.  Buy the bitch a rock coat from Jamaica.  This is the new rock coat man.  It's made of stone. 
[03:14:00]  It's made of stone.  Zip the rock coat.  Throw her over.  He throw this rock coat on man.  You want to buy a beautiful rock coat.  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  It's a big stone man yo.  Get down.  Did you get her the stone flip flops too man.  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Here's the rock coat. 
[03:14:30]  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave hoeing.  All right.  People's dancing on the upper deck.  You bump the bitch on right in the conga line.  Come on everybody.  Come on one more time around the promenade.  Sink like a rock rock rock.  We're your rock rock coat.  Come on everybody. 
[03:15:00]  I'm going to try this.  This is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave ho.  Yeah.  Do you have a splash Anthony?  Oh my God.  You're getting ready for the heave ho and everyone's having a good time upstairs.  Hold on.  So then you do the heave ho.  First you got to get rid of her.  Knock her on the head.  All right. 
[03:15:30]  You knock her on the head.  She's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh that was the splash?  Yeah.  You got it.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what she hears.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  It's a fucking boat.  Oh I found a friend.  It goes through your mind.  Oh no. 
[03:16:00]  And then reality sinks in and it's over.  That's the boat.  Sailing.  The boat sailing away.  That's the last thing you hear from civilization is fucking feeling hot, hot, hot, hot.  Oh that whole ocean would be green from my yellow piss in that full water.  Done.  I just would die.  Done.  Here we go.  Here's more audio of passengers disappearing.  It is estimated that about a dozen people have disappeared on cruises in the last two years. 
[03:16:30]  A dozen?  Legally it is a murky area because the ships fly foreign flags.  And so this afternoon Congress will convene a special hearing into crimes and disappearances  aboard cruise ships.  The bottom line is we are suspicious candidly that there's some huge problems in the cruise  line industry and we think that people are not aware of some of the challenges and some  of the potential problems they may encounter. 
[03:17:00]  It's not a huge problem for the cruise industry.  There are people out there that have figured out how to off their loved one, a problem person.  Yeah, like I said, you got to be on the back of the boat, one of the lower balconies so that  way no one, you know, is going to see the body floating by once they're off the back of the boat.  Nobody's going to anywhere.  You said you've been on a cruise.  Oh yeah.  You've been on a cruise over here?  Oh yeah.  It's, there's nothing, there's no place anywhere in the boat that you can't die and somebody 
[03:17:30]  will see you.  You don't need a special plan for this.  You just toss them off anywhere by the boat, anywhere, falling, there's nobody to hear you.  It's a giant mall.  That's what the fuck, it's not even something you enjoy to see.  It's not even the ocean.  And you were doing late at night while everyone else is pretty much back in their rooms.  Snoozing, three in the morning, whereas when this guy disappeared, by the way.  Quick, easy murder of your wife on the boat, right?  This is so romantic.  Look at the stars. 
[03:18:00]  We don't get to see those kind of stars in New York, do we, sweetie?  Oh my God, all the building light.  Look at, wow, I think that one's Jupiter.  Come here, bitch.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter!  Yeah.  What's up, Peter?  So the real question I have is, if you're taking a cruise out to Nassau, do you throw her  off the boat before or after you get there?  Uh, yeah, I, I, hmm, well, if you want to enjoy the beach, I would say after, because 
[03:18:30]  it's hard to throw her off and look convincingly sad if you're then on the beach hanging with  some chicks and an umbrella drink.  Right.  I just lost my wife.  I can't find her, but I paid for the fucking cruise.  Right.  I might as well have a dirty banana and, uh, you know, I'm going to have a few rum drinks  and some pina coladas for everybody.  Get my hair braided.  I feel like a rum swizzle right after throwing the bitch overboard.  All right, I'm buying.  The fucking rock coat is killing me, Patrice. 
[03:19:00]  Get your rock coat.  Get your rock coat, man.  And these goofy motherfuckers are buying.  Oh, a rock coat.  Wow.  A rock coat is, uh, great.  You got a guy on the coast guard.  Made of rock, you know.  Bill, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  My, uh, my last duty station was in, uh, Sandy Hook, New Jersey.  Their area of responsibility was lower New York Harbor.  And we were out, uh, looking for a guy that fell off a Russian traitor.  Tell you, man, there's no fucking way you're going to find somebody out there if they don't  have a strobe light or anything with them. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Plus, we used to do, uh, live man overboard drills.  We used to actually jump off the boat at nighttime with our strobe blades.  Wow.  You want to talk about fucking scary?  And this is a training drill where they know you're jumping.  They're looking for you.  You have a strobe.  And they still can't find you because the waves are bobbing up and down.  Yeah.  All of a sudden that strobe disappears and then comes back because he's bobbing in the waves.  What's the official can't find him time?  Like, what's the official we did what we could, Tom?  Yeah.  You just fucking look for him. 
[03:20:00]  You just look for him until he tell you to stop.  Are you kidding me?  These Coast Guard guys, they just make one big circle and, like, look at their watches.  Nah, we know this guy's gone.  And what's your call?  Like, yo!  Yo!  All right.  Wrap it up.  Woo-hoo!  You there?  Hello?  I bet they're a little more tactful.  I bet it's like...  Bravo, we're running a little low on fuel.  We're going to be bringing it back. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  No, it's...  I don't know.  It's burning like crazy, the fuel.  I think we got a problem because the gauge says I have a tank, but I'm sure we have less.  We're going back.  This motherfucker is so drunk.  So drunk.  Oh, the mic is still keyed.  Sorry.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hi, my name's Ken, and I'd like to hear the, uh, they were talking about the retards doing the Wizard of Oz. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks.  Message deleted.  Let's say hi to Nick.  Nick Swartzen.  Nicholas.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, Nick, hang with us.  We'll get into some of the things you're doing, but we also have to play this yellow brick road.  Or people are going to kill us.  Before anything, though.  It's the new year.  I'm starting something new.  We're very charitable people here on this program.  We are?  Nice.  And, yeah. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  I, and I just want, I, I've been looking for a charity.  And, I'm serious, is there anybody in your family that has any mental disabilities that you would like money given to?  Um, any type of, uh.  My uncle's kind of retarded.  Really?  But, like, really, or?  No, seriously.  Like, he has, he has a mental problem.  My uncle's Steve.  You might want to come back another day, then.  Yeah.  It's, uh, the next hour.  Wait, we have a retarded Steve here, too.  Right.  See, what are you getting at, Anthony?  Well, that's the whole new angle this year. 
[03:22:00]  It's not making so many people uncomfortable.  Oh, I see.  Remember, who was in here that day, and we were going off, uh, and, and they didn't say  a word, and we were going off about some retarded show.  Oh, that was, uh, Vinny.  Right.  Vinny Brandt.  How uncomfortable is that?  I like now getting these things out in the clear, so I'm going to use my charity ruse.  But how did you know that?  Every time.  He had a.  I didn't.  He wasn't supposed to.  He was supposed to go, no, I don't give a shit about fucking retards.  And then we roll and all laugh about the yellow brick road.  But now there's going to be an uncomfortable retarded uncle. 
[03:22:30]  I didn't say that I was, I had a problem with it.  I mean, like.  Oh, you don't care?  No.  Oh, okay.  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  He tried to stab you Thanksgiving?  He tried to stab me at a Thanksgiving.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So fuck him.  I'm going down.  Going down.  Well, Anthony discovered this little thing.  Well, I saw it on Cinemax, I guess it was.  I'm not even sure.  One of those fucking things.  Maybe HBO Family.  And it was a bunch of retarded people and mentally challenged whether they had Down Syndrome 
[03:23:00]  or something else.  I don't know.  A bunch of different types of retarded conditions.  But they all were brought together, one group, to perform The Wizard of Oz in full costume  with a director and stage hands and music and everything.  And I could not take my eyes off.  Yeah.  Phil might be tapping out.  I tap out on retards.  Phil taps out on retards.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Remember?  I did a bit one time on stage and I made a woman cry. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  And that was it for you?  Yeah, I just think I got some bad calm.  I haven't tried to have kids yet.  And I'm tapping out.  See?  That would have caused me to write more retarded material.  That's the fucking greatest thing ever.  You know what's funny?  And his is probably the most innocent retarded joke ever.  Do you remember it?  I was making fun of that movie, I Am Sam.  I was talking about how Hollywood...  Of course we do all the time.  Yeah, how Hollywood depicts retarded people as if they somehow accidentally have these unbelievable  insights into life and accidentally throw out these metaphors. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah!  You know what I mean?  And I was like, I worked with retarded kids at no point did they ever accidentally say  anything.  Right.  And lighten you.  Yes.  Right.  And then you couldn't throw sticks on the ground.  They're like, hey, 62.  And then you go to Vegas.  And the punchline was, if retarded people really had these skills, we wouldn't put them in those  special schools.  We'd have them working in the Pentagon.  Hey, where's the Al-Qaeda going to attack next?  And you throw matches on the ground. 
[03:24:30]  Hey, I think they're going to attack Disney World.  It was in front of like 18 people.  That's funny.  Who cried over that joke?  Well, she started flipping out.  And then I said, I'm not making fun of retarded kids.  I'm talking about...  Right.  Hollywood.  Yeah.  About them.  No, I was an asshole.  I should have backed off.  And then she got up and walked out.  It was like in front of 18 people.  So she gets up, like, teared up and walked out.  And then it's just awkwardness.  And I'm just standing there like, yeah, okay.  And then all of a sudden her husband finally has the balls to get up.  And then he walks out.  And then like 30 seconds later, their friend finally gets up and goes, wow. 
[03:25:00]  That ain't right.  And then he fucking walks out.  No way.  Oh, it was awful.  It's like the whole crowd, like, one at a time with, like, 30 second breaks was just  getting up and walking out.  Everyone leave.  Worst DNA first, please.  The worst is when you get hung out to dry on something where you're pointing out some  kind of flaw in Hollywood.  Yeah.  And it's taken as you goofing on retarded people.  How do you handle it? 
[03:25:30]  Believe me.  This will be goofing on retarded people.  Not your fun, insightful little joke there.  Not your clever joke.  Right.  I was working Dangerfield.  There's no real handling it.  I mean, it's not like you're going to affect your career.  You weren't young.  Well, I was just saying, people.  18 people.  That wasn't easy.  Yeah, no.  Well, it's hard to do that and then segue into, so I got a computer.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Did the manager have to, like, give them three passes?  No, they don't care there at all.  No.  Speaking of slow, I still have dial-up. 
[03:26:00]  Speaking of things that parted people will never do, I got a computer.  Right.  That's the tone of segue.  Billy, can I have my retarded uncle grant you, like, a retarded pardon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  I don't know.  Now, if he's willing to hang out with the retarded uncle.  Should we do this or not?  Oh, my God.  He's got a retarded uncle.  Did I kill another?  Bill Burr wants to tap out.  No, bring it, dude.  Oh, you don't think the message boards would get that?  Did I kill another bit?  I mean, I already fucked over that.  Okay, no.  I did a 9-11 benefit at the Stress Factory, and, um... 
[03:26:30]  Hey, don't you fucking talk about that.  No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That, we won't fucking deal with.  I'm as red, white, and blue as they come.  No, I got a...  And I did a retarded joke, and it was up on these retarded message boards.  People who have retarded family.  If I find the thread, I'll bring it in.  We can print it.  But it was really...  Retarded message boards, and by that you mean whackbag.com?  No.  No?  Oh, okay.  I think he's not doing good on the show.  Hey, when he comes back to me, hey, you fucking cunts.  Um, not whackbag, the other one who's... 
[03:27:00]  I like ice cream.  No, this is about people of retarded kids.  They were really fucking upset, and one woman actually, who babies retarded kids,  I used to fool around with in my car, actually defended me.  You know what?  No!  Oh, Jesus Christ, you just crumbled up the bit.  What's wrong with everybody?  Well, we gotta do it.  Do it.  Look, I'm against it.  It's the Yellow Brick Road.  The retarded production of Wizard of Oz.  Anthony found this.  So, let's listen to a couple, see if it's even worthy of, not goofing on, but discussing. 
[03:27:30]  Because I'll be honest with you, I watched a show the other day, I mentioned it, called  I Have Tourette's, but Tourette's Doesn't Have Me.  It was a show about children, junior high school age, with Tourette's Syndrome.  And I'm there, sitting in, buckled in, all ready to lock.  Doing a radio show.  And it wasn't.  It was very touching, sensitive, done very well, nice.  And it wasn't, didn't have any comedy value.  Good cinematography.  It was not any comedy value.  There was nothing to bring here to the show to goof on or anything. 
[03:28:00]  Perhaps this is the same.  So what you're saying is we're going to have an informed discussion about the merits of  the mentally challenged doing old movie.  Old classics.  Classics.  Let's not jump.  Retarded classics.  Yeah.  Retarded classics.  Absolutely.  Let's start with the first track here.  Keep an open mind.  Let's be adults.  This is the Tin Man Singing.  This is a production of Gone With My Intelligence. 
[03:28:30]  Oof, as dumb as the wind.  All right.  The Tin Man Sings, everyone.  When a man's an empty kettle, he should be on his metal.  And yet I'm torn apart.  Just because I'm presuming that I could be kind of human if I only had a heart. 
[03:29:00]  I'd be gentle and awful sentimental regarding loving art.  I'd be friends with the sparrows and the boy who shoots the arrows if I only had a heart.  You know?  Yikes.  That was nice.  Bill, comment?  I'm just thinking like when you're in class, when like high school, and like if you laugh, 
[03:29:30]  you're going to get suspended.  This should be like the Olympics of it.  And they should just put kids there and like...  Yeah, because kids are just going to be brutal.  Yeah, who haven't done can hold out the fucking longest.  Yeah.  I just want to see all the parents in the audience proudly watching this.  That's my 30-year-old.  So, so far no one's laughing yet?  No, no.  No, no.  So far?  I think he did a fine job.  Let's see who's twisted.  Fine rendition. 
[03:30:00]  I think the scarecrow one's going to be the hardest.  Yeah, that could be rough.  He wants a brain, yeah.  You know what he wants.  And they all can relate.  All right, here's the teacher laying down the ground rules.  Uh-oh.  All right, everyone listen up, okay?  There's a lot of work to do.  So if every time I call somebody's name, we clap for five minutes, we're not going to  have any time...  Shh, shh, shh.  We're not going to have any time to get any work done.  That's the first thing.  The second thing is there's all different kinds of parts with all different amounts of lines. 
[03:30:30]  But everyone will be on stage.  Everyone will have either a speaking line or a musical number.  Do we all understand that?  Yeah.  Okay.  No.  You know what that was?  What?  Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.  Candy, candy, puppy, puppy, kitty.  Candy, candy, shit your pants, candy, candy, candy, puppy, candy. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, did you hear Bill?  Did you hear the sound he just made?  He went, he went, oh.  Oh, it's disgusted Bill Burr.  I will take it easy.  You're right, you're right.  Yeah.  Now that was, yeah.  That was, he's like, Darryl Gracie's.  Best is that they're going to clap for five minutes every time a name is called.  She said don't, she said don't do.  They're supportive.  They're supportive of each other.  What was in the background?  Did you hear like that?  And then they escorted him out, I think. 
[03:31:30]  Whatever it was, it wasn't the solution to a math problem.  But maybe it was and they didn't let him, you know.  He was actually yelling out something about pie and they're like, all right, shut up, stupid.  All right, here we go.  Mom, I got the witch.  Miss Gulch.  Yes, Miss Gulch.  I got it.  I done.  I got Miss Gulch. 
[03:32:00]  I got the witch.  Yes.  Mother retarded.  Somebody forgot that line.  Somebody.  Yeah.  Who's clapping in the background?  That's my happy.  I just, I'm.  Do you have asthma too?  I know.  I know you're happy.  It's a lot of work.  I was praying for the Miss Gulch.  So much. 
[03:32:30]  You know, I don't mind retards, but at least get the ones that can act.  This fucking retard has no motivation.  Wow.  That wasn't part of the show.  What was that?  It was the girl that got the part of the Wicked Witch calling her mother to tell her that she  had gotten the part she wanted.  Oh, all right.  So she was very emotional about the fact that she had gotten the part, and they, you know,  painted her up green.  What's my motivation to finally be included in a family photograph? 
[03:33:00]  Hey, Jim, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I was just wondering, can you play that version of Somewhere Over the Gene Pool?  Come on.  Sir, please.  It's mean-spirited.  I'm sorry.  All right.  This next clip, we meet the Wicked Witch.  I'm Elizabeth O'Brien, and I played the Wicked Witch of the West.  Who killed my sister? 
[03:33:30]  Who killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Was it you?  No, I didn't mean to kill anyone.  It was an accident.  Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too.  Oh, no.  Aren't you forgetting something?  It's a little bit of a question.  It's a good question.  That's no worse than yes, dear.  That's actually better written.  Well, there's the Wicked Witch.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Here's a very famous line.  Oh.  You're cursive, Fred.  What have you done?  Oh, God.  I'm melting.  I'm melting.  Melting.  Oh, what a world.  What a world.  What could a girl like you destroy my beautiful wickedness?  Oh, my gosh.  What do you think? 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You killed her.  That was the gold at the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That sounded like Corky.  That did sound like Corky.  A guest star, right?  A big cameo.  Yes.  That's hilarious.  Who is, like, repeating her line?  Because that's the witch is supposed to be saying that line.  That's the teacher, probably, reading her.  You think?  I think maybe it was Dorothy, like, not knowing she's not supposed to say that.  You ever see, like, kids in a movie sometimes or a TV show, they're actually mouthing the  words that the other person is speaking as they're doing them? 
[03:35:00]  I think that's what she was kind of doing.  You got to smack around a little.  Isn't that rehearsal, though?  Is this rehearsal still?  Yeah, this is rehearsal.  Oh, maybe.  All right.  They're rehearsing.  All right.  It'll get better.  We meet the line.  Than your show you're doing for HBO, right?  Honest to God, Louis C.K. does actually do the lines like that sometimes.  Does it?  In rehearsal.  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?  So it happens.  All right.  We meet the lion here.  My name is John Stare, and I'm playing the Cowardy Lion in this play. 
[03:35:30]  Ah!  Put him up.  Put him up.  That's not bad.  Which one of you first?  I'll fight you both together if you like.  I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back.  I'll fight you standing on one foot.  I'll fight you with my eyes closed.  Oh.  Pull an axe on me, eh?  That's him talking to intelligent thoughts.  Sneaking up on me, eh?  I didn't bite him.  It's my nose bleeding. 
[03:36:00]  You are relentless.  Of course not.  My goodness, he's nothing but a great, big coward.  You're right.  I am a coward.  I haven't gotten courage at all.  I even scared myself.  Well, I don't doubt that.  I'm really getting into the whole spirit of The Wizard of Oz, though.  They're doing a great job with the acting.  It isn't just, like, droning battle.  Yeah, it's not just really putting some emotion. 
[03:36:30]  All right, now we meet the mayor.  Bill Burr will be at Caroline's all weekend long.  He's always here for these shows.  When are you going to realize that you always have these shows?  Yeah, I know.  And you just don't notice until I come in.  Maybe you're right.  Here we go.  One time I hit the ball in the dog's face, and I didn't even know I did it that day.  It ate his prime rib.  It's a time here.  That's it.  Did you see that, Matt? 
[03:37:00]  No.  No?  It's a workout for me.  Ah, that's a little off time, I guess.  Yeah, of course.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I'm watching that show last night, and thanks to that show, my girlfriend thinks I'm the  most disgusting human being on the face of this planet.  Why?  What happened?  I laughed throughout the whole thing.  I was laughing so hard, I could hardly breathe, especially after the retard at the end was  saying, just don't call me late for dinner.  Yeah, that was his big joke at the end.  And then he stared off into space somewhere where he just was gone.  And they just fade to black and show the credits, and they just leave you hanging with 
[03:37:30]  that nice little cliffhanger of him staring off into blankness.  And the girl that played the Wicked Witch reminds me of Rosie O'Donnell in that movie  she did.  Yeah.  You remember the Rosie O'Donnell movie where she played the other part of a woman on the  bus?  Yeah.  Well, dude, it's not bad laughing through the whole thing.  Your girlfriend should have been happier that you weren't fucking her through the entire  production.  Then you're dating a psychopath.  As you're watching it.  You're banging her, and she's talking, like, shh, I want to hear this.  Yeah, well, the problem is my girlfriend used to work with autistic people, so I guess she 
[03:38:00]  was kind of sensitive about it.  Of course.  And she kind of played it off like, oh, I really want to see this.  This sounds real interesting.  And then throughout the whole thing, I'm just freaking laughing my fucking ass off.  All right.  There's just something, like, uncomfortable, but you've got to kind of chuckle at some  of the little awkward mistakes they make.  You've got to laugh a little bit.  I mean, you know.  I'm not running up.  No, that's why.  You think if I was there, I wouldn't be laughing my ass off?  Of course you would be.  That's the problem, is because you're not allowed to. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  If they would just let you, it wouldn't even be nearly as funny.  Right.  Maybe.  You didn't sound like that.  It didn't sound like that.  No, I agree with you.  I'm just saying, it's not like running up to people in wheelchairs on the street, pointing  and laughing in their face.  That would be fantastic.  After they were all by.  You're doing it very cowardly.  I am doing it very cowardly.  You're recording them.  Record, bring in, laugh, faceless microphone.  Right.  I'll agree with that.  I got no problem with it, either. 
[03:39:00]  Let's go to Brandon in New Jersey.  Brandon.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  You want a pistol license.  I'd probably get sung by the kids' moms if I only had a coat hanger.  Punch it out, buddy.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy shit.  If I only had an HMO.  Zagman from Whackbag.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I could drop this piece of jelly with a kick right through my belly. 
[03:39:30]  Zagman.  Yes, sir.  Hey.  I didn't realize that I was playing the Calvin Blue Bargain.  There you go.  Who?  Stern.  Cowardly Lion.  Oh, hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  All right, let's play the next clip here.  Mayor says his one line in the play.  We grilled him on his one line and how he would say it and, you know, what the rhythm of the line would be. 
[03:40:00]  And he was willing to do that, to repeat it again and again and again, to get it right, to get it how we wanted it to be.  As mayor of the Munston City in the country.  Sorry.  County.  County of the land of Oz, I welcome you most.  Weagally.  Weagally.  As mayor of Munston City in the county of the land of Oz, I welcome you to, I re-welcome you most eagerly. 
[03:40:30]  You know it's perfect.  I don't want you to know that before.  A plus.  A plus.  Perfect.  A plus.  Oh, my God.  All you got to do is not bite somebody's face.  Oh, look, a star on your tongue.  Good boy.  Well, as we move on to Tin Man and Scarecrow, Match Wits here.  Oh, Match.  Well, I just want to say that this is quite an honor. 
[03:41:00]  And, um, I'm, I'm going to have lots of fun.  Oh, you're going to have lots of fun?  Yeah.  What about...  Are you sure?  Yeah.  What about you, Dan?  What about me?  I'm, they just gave you the roll of a, of a scarecrow with a straw in me and I'm going to...  That's retarded.  What are you doing?  They're going to burn me on fire.  I'm going to be falling apart here and there. 
[03:41:30]  Falling apart.  You're falling apart even when you're not a scarecrow.  That's true.  You were falling apart in the summer and you're still falling apart.  Take the DNA and run.  Take the money and run.  I like it.  Everything you always wanted to know and couldn't.  Oh, fuck it.  Retards over Broadway.  Bill's in!  Bill's in!  What are you going to do?  Bill Burr, Caroline's always along. 
[03:42:00]  When in Rome.  Buckles under the peer pressure.  Downs and misdemeanors.  Let's go to Chris the Trucker.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering how'd they get the mayor of Boston there to play the mayor in that  show you guys were talking about.  It sounded like Menino, didn't it?  We like the monkey blue.  The monkey blue.  Tin man needs a wheelchair.  You've told us all about this part, Anthony.  Yeah, the tin man.  Some black guy in silver paint in a wheelchair being pushed by a tree. 
[03:42:30]  Someone dressed as a tree trying to cover up the fact that he's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, I had the same reaction.  See what I mean?  It's like a test.  It is.  To see if you can somehow hold your shit together.  Yeah, when I saw that, it was over.  Then David could give his line.  Where do we go now?  And the scarecrow can point back to the center of the cart.  Where do we go?  No, stand back.  Oh, boy.  He's getting a little unsteady. 
[03:43:00]  He's getting unsteady.  Let's get...  Unsteady.  We thought, wouldn't it be great if David could play the tin man with his crutches and  not be in the wheelchair?  And, you know, certainly he had that body form of the tin man, and he was stiff, and it  was rigid, and the movement would be difficult, and that would play nicely, but it just didn't  come to be.  That's not appropriate.  Because they wanted him on his crutches.  Yeah.  Like he had those braces crutches, and his legs are real stiff and stuff, and they wanted  him to walk around like that. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  She just blatantly exploited him.  Yeah.  Right?  He walks weird, and we thought we would play into that.  He could really make an authentic walking tin man.  Well, his deformity is not only mental, but physical, so we figured we'd play with that  and make it work.  We spray-painted him silver.  I mean, painted him silver.  All he got to do is leave that dope in a room with silver paint.  He'll put his face in it.  Get this gum at the bottom.  Go ahead.  Enjoy, stupid.  Stupid.  Dave, what's going on? 
[03:44:00]  Hey, it's good to hear Club Soda Candy getting some theater work.  Yeah.  And Frank.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, man.  Is Big A going theatrical on us, or what?  Yeah, Big A in the production?  Yeah, sounds like it.  We should do our own production with Big A, Club Soda Candy.  Oh, yeah.  With Carla Verne Shirley.  All right.  Why the director calls the slow kids, kids. 
[03:44:30]  I call these kids, kids.  And sometimes people that don't work with me or my personal friends say, you know, when  they come to the show, I thought these kids were seven years old.  The way that you speak about them, you call them kids.  They're not kids.  They're adults.  But I kind of feel like a mom to them.  And so I feel like they are my kids.  And I think that we have that.  Oh, beautiful.  That was too serious.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a little serious.  She sucks.  If you pump out that many in that mental condition, you should probably stop fucking at one point. 
[03:45:00]  It's not working out.  More from the witch.  She's getting close to the Emerald City.  Well, shoes or no shoes, I'm still counting her.  Wait a minute.  I'm still great enough.  I'm still great enough to counter her.  To conquer.  To conquer her.  Good.  And to Emerald City as fast as lightning. 
[03:45:30]  Their feet are too fat.  They have to give her a red ruby workbook.  Oh, my God.  Nick Swartzen in studio with us today.  Participating.  Participating.  Enjoying.  Yes.  I've got to get my uncle a head shot.  Yes.  Miss Gulch works her line.  All right. 
[03:46:00]  Mr. Gap.  Hi, my name is Gulch.  I want to see you about Dorothy.  I want to face the audience.  Oh.  Talk up a curtain.  I want to talk to you about Dorothy.  What, the light?  Mr. Gap.  Howdy, Miss Gulch. 
[03:46:30]  I want to see you about Dorothy.  What's she doing?  Well, have you seen a bite on my leg?  She bit you?  No, her dog.  Oh, she bit your dog.  No, her dog.  No, dogs are medicine.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and making sure he's destroyed.  Third base.  They took some liberties with it.  Yeah, I was thinking that.  Yeah, really.  They improvised.  That's fine.  Third base.  They bit your leg.  That didn't sound like that.  I was going to say that.  Were there munchkins? 
[03:47:00]  We don't see the munchkins in this.  Munchkins were all Down syndrome.  Like, they figured they would get all Down syndrome people to play the munchkins.  Now, that's offensive to midgets.  You're right.  They couldn't do that part of the show.  Yeah, why can't you get midgets that are retarded?  They were absolutely using various handicaps as they were exploiting them.  Like, the munchkins all kind of look the same.  And Down syndrome have certain features that are similar, let's say.  And the main one is kind of like Planet of the Apes. 
[03:47:30]  Right.  Where the gorillas were the aggressive ones.  Yes.  The orangutans were the smart ones and the chimpanzees.  It's the same thing.  Yes.  Wait, Nick has to leave?  The working class.  Why are you leaving?  What?  I don't know.  I'm getting a communique from Ben Sparks.  Nick has to leave.  He has another interview.  I want to hear the rest.  How many more tracks are there?  We'll go into 11 with this.  83 tracks.  11 p.m.  All right.  We'll say goodbye to Nick.  He doesn't want to leave, but he has to leave.  I'm sorry you have to go, Nick.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I hate to go.  And this isn't a they're telling us you have to go. 
[03:48:00]  No, not at all.  Absolutely not.  Because sometimes we have to pull out the they're telling us you got to go.  Oh, really?  You know, when things aren't quite going well.  And the guest is like, no, I don't.  Like when Ed Asner was here and it was in the fucking Ed Asner in L.A.  We were all starstruck.  And he says, Ben comes over and signals.  And Ed Asner goes, what was that?  And Ope goes, well, that's what Ben does when the guest is boring.  The fucking Ed Asner.  Ed Asner.  I've never hated the program more.  A classic.  Oh, my.  What did he do?  He was hurt.  Oh, he unloaded. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, he called what he basically called you a pariah.  He hated his guts.  He called me the destroyer.  The destroyer.  Yes.  The destroyer.  The destroyer.  No way.  So he was hip to it and he freaked out.  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't happy.  He kissed me on the cheek.  He kissed Voss on the cheek.  Yeah.  And he said that Ope was a fucking like a white wasp.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  It was great.  He looks really like a kind of guy who could just, you know, squeeze you to death.  He is ultra-legged.  It was one of the most uncomfortable moments.  He is severe, like liberal.  But he's such a sweet guy.  We don't have that clip anymore.  We don't need to hurt Lou Grant.  And Ope was coming off like a real douchebag to him. 
[03:49:00]  No.  No, hard to believe.  And he just, yeah, unloaded on him.  Well, he was boring.  I wasn't there.  I was playing poker at the time.  I'm sure I could have smoothed it all over.  Ope, the heartless point guard.  Let's say hi to him.  It was the good cop, bad cop when the good cop was away.  Yeah, it was basically Ed Asner and Justin Volpe.  All right, here we go.  Yellow Brick Road.  The retarded production of Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  More Tin Man.  I have the brain of a toad.  I have the brain of a toad. 
[03:49:30]  Here's a...  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  I should have been left on the sheet as a load.  Oh, my God.  I just remembered.  You have to leave, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of here.  They're telling us...  But you know what?  I did my laundry yesterday.  I didn't fold it.  You know, it's going to get all...  Yeah, it's going to wrinkle.  All right, here we go.  Since I've been born, my brain never growed.  I can talk...  Oh, my goodness.  I can talk again.  This feels wonderful. 
[03:50:00]  On my arm, please.  How about I've held that axe up for ages?  I've held that axe up for ages.  My goodness.  My goodness.  My goodness.  Do I stink?  You won't confuse me.  You've got a line.  That's why you confuse me.  My goodness.  My goodness.  Um, my goodness.  How'd you ever end up like that?  Good.  Well, about a year ago, I was chopping that tree. 
[03:50:30]  And suddenly, it began to rain.  Raining.  And right in the middle of a chop, I rested solid.  Go ahead.  Bang on it.  Go ahead.  Bang on it.  No heart.  All hollow.  That was his head.  Dong, dong, dong, dong.  Oh, they were doing good.  Yeah.  Rehearsal, you know.  It's a good while.  There's like excitement in their voices. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  They probably get to do something.  How did that happen?  CURSES!  She's getting away.  She's getting closer to Emerald City.  Well, shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to counter her.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  She starts melting because she's spitting on her.  To conquer her.  Say it.  I'm still great enough to conquer?  Conquer.  Conquer.  I'm still great enough to conquer. 
[03:51:30]  That's how they say hit her.  I'm still great enough to conquer her.  Conquer.  Conquer on my head.  I don't like that word.  All right.  Get that retard.  Conquer.  They're just...  She doesn't know what the word means.  No.  She's feeding her blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She don't know what it means.  God bless this woman with a patience.  How about tell her...  No kidding.  What about a little instruction there on conquer?  It means to, you know, overtake somebody, to beat them, to win. 
[03:52:00]  You know, give her a definition.  How about, think about what you've never done with a life problem.  Bill Burr.  More retard stick.  I'm trying to be helpful.  It's a rare fucking fool.  Oh, yes, he is.  Here's the mayor talking about his award.  As mayor of Munston City, in the land, in the county of the land of Oz, I welcome you most regally. 
[03:52:30]  It's real regal.  And that's my only line.  Am I good?  Way to break the fourth wall, stupid.  What did you win an award for?  Really worked in Chocolate Factory.  What does that say?  Best Supporting Actor?  Yeah.  In a comedic role.  Uh-huh.  Oof.  Played at Chocolate Bar.

[03:54:30]  Okay, good  Man, that woman is patient  Unbelievable  She's doing that with her life  Absolutely  You've got to give it up to her  Jim  Her codependency sickens me  And if she had any fucking real chops  She'd be teaching in a college  Wow  No one saw the handfuls of passels  She was taking out of Dorothy's basket  Nobody sees her fucking crying alone in the bathroom  There's no fucking stupid idea 
[03:55:00]  Her dreams were not what she's doing there  Her dreams to produce a show  For Broadway  For Broadway probably  Yeah  Was not that  Alright, if I'm going to be cynical  She wants to get on 60 Minutes  For them to do a whole expose  On how caring she is  Oh, is that it?  And this is going to be her big thing  You know what, Jim?  We ought to host the benefits sometimes  And I'll just say whatever the cause is  And talk about how great it is  And then you can just talk about  What's going on behind the curtain  Alright, I like that  I like that
