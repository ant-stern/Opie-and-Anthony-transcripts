<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment featuring comedian Bill Burr as a guest.  The focus was a scathing review of the Hallmark movie "Riding the Bus with My Sister," starring Rosie O'Donnell, with Burr and the hosts repeatedly using the word "retard" to describe O'Donnell's portrayal of a mentally handicapped woman.  They played clips from the movie and an interview with Tony Danza featuring O'Donnell, mocking her performance and questioning her acting ability.  They also discussed photos of O'Donnell with her girlfriend from her website. The conversation broadened to include other actors portraying disabled individuals, such as Tom Hanks in "Forrest Gump" and Corky, a performer with Down syndrome.  Numerous listener calls fueled the mocking tone.

Next, the show moved to a highly critical and offensive review of another movie starring Andie MacDowell, again employing derogatory terms like "retard" to describe a character. The movie, featuring a dysfunctional family including a "big retarded black guy" boyfriend, was dissected scene by scene, with crude jokes targeting weight, race, and sexually suggestive content.  The hosts imitated the main character's voice mockingly, and interjected segments mocking Hallmark commercials and reminiscing about after-school specials.

Tracy Morgan then joined the show in studio. The conversation immediately devolved into sexually explicit humor, focusing on Morgan's son's masturbation, his own sexual exploits, and graphic descriptions of body odor and sex. He promoted a celebrity golf tournament and shared anecdotes, including one about showing pornography to a starstruck SNL intern (the grandson of Howard Cosell, who later called in).  Morgan discussed his experiences at SNL, his views on the show's use of black talent, and other TV appearances.  He recounted a memorable SNL line about Brittany Murphy's "big fat ass," boasted about kissing her multiple times, and shared more sexually explicit jokes.  The conversation also touched upon Michael Jackson's trial, Star Wars, and a fictional rivalry between Papa Smurf and Smurfette.  Later, Dee Dee, a previous guest, joined, recounting a bizarre incident involving a drunken marriage in Las Vegas to a man with counterfeit money, and her subsequent recovery from substance abuse. The segment concluded with a "Hi, Mom" call-in bit and a musical parody about changing diapers and death.  A brief discussion about the contentious relationship between Patrice O'Neal and Vinny Brand, who were present earlier, followed.


A segment focusing on comedian Patrice O'Neal's upcoming performance at Vinny's Stress Factor club ensued.  The hosts, Vinny, and Jimmy Norton (via phone call) engaged in profane banter targeting race and other topics.  There was a running gag about Vinny's allegedly unsanitary fries, and Anthony recounted a painful dental procedure. The hosts expressed mixed feelings about Patrice, and there was a lengthy, vulgar attack on Voss and his girlfriend, Bonnie.  The segment unexpectedly included a surprise appearance by country singer Travis Tritt, who gave a lengthy interview discussing his career, challenges, and views on other artists.  He also discussed an incident where a quarter was thrown at him onstage.

Following Travis Trittâ€™s departure, a sexually aggressive and vulgar caller targeted the hosts and a female named Betsy with explicit comments and threats.  The show then attempted a confused and increasingly angry phone conversation with someone named Willie Fager, culminating in further threats and insults. The broadcast concluded with a promotional announcement.

[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you very much.  You're listening to the worst.  You're listening to the worst.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  It's the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  The worst of Opie and Anthony's.  It's absolutely awful.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Anthony and Jim Norton are on vacation.  If we were here today.  If we were here really, we would be doing the show.  That's right. 
[00:04:30]  That's right.  But in the meantime, we're going to give you a few bits.  But in the meantime, we're going to give you a few bits that we love, we like a lot.  This ought to hold the little fuckers for a while.  And Bill Burr is still here.  I don't even get why, but he's a friend and we like when he stops by.  Because it's Tuesday morning.  No, it's Monday.  No, it's Tuesday morning.  I'm going to blow the lid off this.  Yeah.  This scandal.  This ruse.  Yeah, Bill was on the show about a week ago, and here he is helping us out with this. 
[00:05:00]  Rosie the Retard, Anthony.  Yes.  Remember Rosie O'Donnell was in that Hallmark movie playing a woman with mental handicap?  Riding the bus or something like that?  Riding the bus with my sister.  Sponsored by Hallmark.  Ugh.  Yeah.  She talks about her role on the Danza show, and we get a little preview of her retarded character acting.  Wait, this is not, okay, this is not after the actual movie.  This is actually before.  This is before. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, this is going to be a part two to this bit.  This is when we were first on to it and going, ah, there's something here.  Did we poke fun at it?  I don't remember.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  I think we might have poked a bit of fun at it.  Good nature, though, I hope.  If you get a chuckle out of part one, stick around for part two, because it's very, very funny.  But first, Rosie the Retard, part one.  Pishoo, pishoo, pishoo.  Lasers, you know?  Nice, right?  Yeah.  That worked.  All right.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I know. 
[00:06:00]  Why don't we, ah, you want to do the Rosie O'Donnell clips?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  From Tony Danza yesterday?  Of course.  There's an ad right here with her picture riding the bus with my sister, and it's just,  it makes me angry how awful it is.  The ad itself is a Forrest Gump-looking rip-off thing.  They have her sitting on a park bench, a bus bench, whatever it is, with the, like, clouds  in the background, the same type of Forrest Gump look.  I guess she's going for her Emmy.  Is that what this is?  I was hoping for an Emmy.  Anybody that plays a retard on a TV movie is really gunning for that Emmy. 
[00:06:30]  Yep.  Had her on Tony Danza yesterday.  Somebody on one of the message boards popped up a website also.  She has a photo website.  You know how people have photo websites?  You can post your pictures of your vacations or family get-togethers or whatever it is.  She has one of those.  And I went to it, and it's just her, like, if one of her girlfriend there and her laying  in bed together, a picture of a girlfriend's face looking all like they just woke up in  the morning, picture Rosie's face on the pillow. 
[00:07:00]  Rosie's a big, fat mess, but she did well for herself.  Yeah, she didn't look that bad at all.  I mean, her chick.  I mean, if you're going to be a lesbian, I mean, she did all right, man.  She did all right.  And then she's got her pictures of her kids on vacation.  It's like, she's just got this need, I guess, to open her life up to the public like that.  Like, out of nowhere, all of a sudden, she came out of the closet.  Now, everything.  Look at these pictures.  They're just like anyone's pictures that would be online.  What kind of an idiot would put their pictures all over the...  And she writes all personal stuff in her blog. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, right.  Whoa, what kind of idiot would do that?  Yeah, man.  See, look at the picture.  There's the two of them in bed.  Where?  Where's the bed picture?  That was it.  That's the one?  Back up.  Back up, Eric.  Walk back.  Down.  Yeah, right there.  The two next to each other.  You see Rosie's on the pillow or something.  That's creepy, yeah.  She's kind of a porker.  Oh, yeah.  Her girlfriend's a porker.  Wasn't she...  No, that's not her...  That's her other friend.  That's not the one she's sleeping with. 
[00:08:00]  That's the chick...  I hate to admit this, but I...  Do you know who that is?  Yeah, she used to work on the Rosie O'Donnell show.  What, Faggot?  I know, I know.  I know.  That's really bad.  Which is the one that she's...  Which one is she...  That one right there.  Yeah.  The much thinner one.  Yeah, it says, Us in L.A.  That's her.  Us.  She's a hot little blonde.  If you keep going, I think there's better pictures of her.  Yeah.  But she was on Tony Danza yesterday, plugging her show, her movie, and I have been a fan 
[00:08:30]  over the years of made-for-TV retard movies.  I love them.  Can't get enough watching people try to act retarded.  And like Jimmy has said in the past, for some reason, that's totally acceptable.  It's fine.  People watch.  They do little goofy things.  There's always these comic moments where they're screwing something up in a retarded  way, and the audience laughs along, and that's fine.  Right.  But Jimmy gets on stage and does a retard joke, and you know, you're the Antichrist.  You suck.  You stink.  You should burn in hell.  Do a cute little reference about like, yeah, hey, there's a retarded person. 
[00:09:00]  Let's pick up a stick and molest it.  Molest it.  So what?  The lacrosse team wants to do a little, have a little fun with her.  Yeah.  So what?  They throw milk money on her chest when they're finished?  There's no skill in acting retarded, too.  None.  None whatsoever.  None.  We've all done it our whole, you know, our whole lives.  Why is it looked at like this big acting challenge that is so amazing when they do? 
[00:09:30]  It's the easiest thing to do.  They all put on the stupid retard voice and walk around stupid.  Tom Hanks and Forrest Gump, he did a good job.  Ben's been doing it for years.  You've got to give him credit.  But a lot of these other movies that come out, I'm just reminded of being in high school  with my friends, and we all did the retard voice and stuff.  Right.  I want to be like a normal person.  There.  Give me a fucking Emmy.  If Rosie wants to win an Emmy, she should act thin.  That would be impressive.  Act thin and act like you love dick. 
[00:10:00]  Who's the thin chick with the cock in her hand?  That's Rosie.  Give her an award.  It's amazing.  So she's got this movie.  It's coming out Sunday.  Do we have the Corky CD?  We've got to get the Corky CD.  Corky.  Oh, Corky.  Singing Poison Ivy.  Now that guy should win an award, because that's a real retard acting in a TV series.  How they got him to do anything is amazing. 
[00:10:30]  You see some of these guys, they're just banging their heads, going crazy.  And they actually, you know, he followed direction.  Well, I bet you, if you look behind the scenes, right off camera, there's the director and his  parents holding cow prods.  So, like, if he didn't say his lines right, he got a good shoulder and a fat thigh.  He gave him a teaching.  We've interviewed Corky over the years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You, um, I remember I was at the studio at BAB once, and it had a door with a little glass  window in it. 
[00:11:00]  A little glass window.  I'm so proud of you that you remember this one.  Oh, this one was a shining moment.  And, uh, this guy is peeking in the window.  He looks in the window, and obviously...  And he's just like, ah!  He has Down syndrome.  And, and Opie points at the window, he goes, hey, look, Corky's at the window.  Joking.  Because that's not laughing.  Yeah, because that's what, every time you see a retard, you go, hey, Corky.  It's Corky.  And, um, lo and behold, it was Corky.  He was there to do an interview. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't know it at the time, though.  I really didn't...  But what are you supposed to do?  So, we invited him in, and, uh, it was just awful radio for five or ten minutes.  He would have a similar look, you know.  Was he nice?  Actually, he was really cool.  I gotta, I gotta admit.  You didn't ask about the script or the, or the, or the plot lines.  Do you like cookies?  That was pretty much it.  Blow a pinwheel in front of his face for 15 minutes, and then send him on his way.  Ooh.  Ooh.  He was doing a children's CD at the time. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Remember the creepy guys that were, you know, his handlers or whatever you want to call  them?  Weren't they following him around?  A couple of musicians that, um, took him under, under their wing and, and had him singing  songs?  Oof.  That was another thing.  Two guys decided they were gonna hook up with Corky and, um, have him sing on their,  uh, on their CD.  It was just awful.  What were they doing?  Songs like Poison Ivy?  Yeah.  We used to have the CD, but it's like, Poison Ivy comes to creeping when you're, and you're 
[00:12:30]  bad that they pay.  If you just throw in this bad line every so often, ooh.  Then they took him to Romania and put a little hat on him and made him dance to make tourists  happy.  With a muzzle on so he doesn't bite anybody.  We're talking, ruin your day.  What?  What is he talking about?  What the hell is he talking about?  That's funny.  You're a great idiot.  All right, so we got some clips.  Tony Danza and Rosie O'Donnell talking here. 
[00:13:00]  A retard.  Yeah.  Here's like an intro clip.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister, and it's directed by one of our dear friends,  Angelica Houston, who we love.  Yeah.  And Andy McDowell's in the picture, and, uh, and, you know, uh, it's Rosie playing a, uh,  a special person.  Yeah.  Oh.  And.  Take that, a retard!  Playing a special person.  Ugh.  You know Tony Danza's like, hey, you're just playing a fucking retard, you know?  Yeah.  A special person.  I can't wait till she thanks him for being the inspiration in the film. 
[00:13:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, you're welcome, all right?  Uh, jackass.  Tony's hungry today.  People just sound stupid and uncomfortable when they're trying to be politically correct.  A special person.  He sounded completely uncomfortable.  Playing, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a special person.  Special person.  What does that mean?  Exactly.  It's not special!  I understand you want to say they're special.  If you're the parent of a, a mentally disabled child, I'm sure you want to say they're special. 
[00:14:00]  They're not special.  They, they got a problem.  They, something happened.  Why is it only in that case where something that's not good is special?  Right.  Special is always good.  Oh, look, my special girl.  Right.  Oh, look at that special, special, uh, gift I got.  Yeah.  It's very special.  Look at my special child.  Oh, the boy's an honor roll.  You're doing an HBO special.  That's right.  It's special. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, and there it kind of fits in.  Yeah, but when it's bad, you know, because, uh, your kid, your kid came out, uh, with a  couple of chromosomes.  A lot of people out there that would say that's not a bad thing, that they had a special kid.  Really?  Yes.  Ooh.  That it has enriched their lives.  Oh, I know what they got.  Whatever gets you through the day, I understand.  Whatever you got to pump through your mind to make it, so you don't jump out the window.  I understand.  I understand why you say special. 
[00:15:00]  We all like lemonade, don't we?  Mm-hmm.  Because if you don't say special, you'll lose your mind looking at the kid next door that  came out perfect and plays baseball.  Yeah.  And doesn't try to eat it.  I understand, believe me, but it's not special.  And hearing Tony Danza say special, you could just hear it in his voice.  It's uncomfortable and not natural.  And you don't have to say, hey, look, I hear you're playing a dummy.  But he could have said it like, uh, hey, Rosie's playing a retarded person. 
[00:15:30]  There's nothing degrading about saying retarded person.  Growth, your growth mentally has been retarded.  Retarded.  That's what it is.  Growth has been, like, well, in that case, it should be a stopped person.  Because retarded implies that there's still some growth there.  So you're reversed.  Yeah, but they don't like retarded because it implies that there's no room for growth there.  That they don't have the potential.  And, of course, they're special and do have the potential.  They're not retarded.  They are advancing on it. 
[00:16:00]  Retarded.  Say retarded.  Everybody knows.  All right, so getting back to the clip, Tony Vance is starting to talk about the movie with Rosie O'Donnell.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love.  Yeah.  And Andy McDowell is in the picture.  And, you know, it's Rosie playing a special person.  Yeah.  And here, I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is.  As.  Oh! 
[00:16:30]  All right, who heard that?  I heard it.  You guys heard it, right?  Okay.  Fat housewife.  Oh!  Oh!  Look how dear she looks.  Oh!  She's sitting there on a...  And she's wearing light blue shorts.  And one blue sneaker and one pink sneaker and socks.  She's our own girl.  She sure is.  Yeah.  She dresses herself.  And she has fat legs with no bend marks on them.  And it bothers me.  Old clay legs.  So that... 
[00:17:00]  They show the picture to the audience and you hear one lady.  We backed up, go...  Oh!  Oh!  Do you know what the reaction should have been from the crowd?  Ah!  Ick!  Ick!  Oof!  Or ha-ha-ha!  Yeah, hysterical laughter.  Ha-ha-ha!  And it just shows me there's a whole section of society I just don't get.  Oof!  I just don't get it.  Yeah.  If you're awing this picture, just shoot yourself, please.  Oh! 
[00:17:30]  And here I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is as Beth.  And I was knocked out, Rose.  I really...  I was...  You know, first of all, this is a risky job.  You take this job, you go...  This is either they're going to tell me what am I thinking...  Yeah.  ...or the other way.  I think you've done the other thing.  It's a...  It's an incredible...  It's an incredible love story about siblings, first of all, which I love.  And, um...  What?  Let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be...  This is a fucking dummy. 
[00:18:00]  It's an incredible love story between siblings, which I love.  I love to sibble.  I do that a lot.  I enjoy it.  The art of sibling.  What a retard.  He's a retard.  Ugh.  Trying to sell this like it's a big challenge, you know, taking a chance to...  No, it isn't.  What else is Rosie doing?  And her dopey audience will eat this up.  Just lap this crap up.  She's wearing a hat that she stole from the set of Blossom. 
[00:18:30]  Wearing like a My Little Pony t-shirt.  She's got Harpo Marks hair.  Yes.  What a wreck.  Stereotyping.  This is...  I swear to you, it is so stereotyping retards.  It is.  It's a stereotype of a retard.  The voice she does.  Her mannerisms.  It's not like she's a great actress and studied retards and, you know, got every detail down.  This is her, back in Comac in high school, goofing on a retard. 
[00:19:00]  It's pretty much what she's doing.  And they're filming it.  She probably had the same character during Powder Puff.  Yeah.  Did you guys have Powder Puff in your high school?  Where you do goofy skits for the rest of the school?  It was called the talent show.  For some reason, they called it Powder Puff.  At Harborfield?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Awful.  I know.  Powder Puff.  Powder Puff.  Why would they call it Powder Puff?  I have no idea, man. 
[00:19:30]  How gay is it?  Well, who put it on?  The skits were pretty gay.  Powder Puff.  It was pretty gay.  It was pretty awful.  It was pretty stupid.  There is not one drama department in one school anywhere in the world that is not run by gay people.  So, not that there's anything wrong with that.  That's right.  Yes.  Powder Puff.  Oof.  When I was a little boy, I was in the school play.  And I only had one, like a couple lines.  I don't remember them.  But it was about a boy who was dirty.  And I said, maybe we should have him dry cleaned. 
[00:20:00]  That was my acting line.  Did people laugh?  I don't remember.  I was so scared.  I stunk.  What play was it?  I don't know.  Did you have poopy in your pants?  I'm sure I did afterwards.  Little rusty drawers.  Flat and shite.  Flattened from nervous boys sitting in it.  Maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  Maybe you should be dry cleaned.  You stink.  I crap myself.  All right.  Back to the clip here, guys.  About siblings, first of all, which I love. 
[00:20:30]  And let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to it.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  No, not Britney.  No.  And you're a doctor.  I'm a retard.  I'm on the bus.  La, la, la, la.  I'm on the bus.  She's doing fucking Pee Wee Herman.  What is that?  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  What was that? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, God damn it.  And Tony Dance is giving her props.  Yeah.  This is amazing.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's hear a little more.  Let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to it.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  No, not Britney.  I'm Cole Best.  And you're a adulto and you're new. 
[00:21:30]  How do you know my name?  You're new.  Because I know everything.  Listen.  You have to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Don't listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg and she has to go to the doctorate at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolfo, and listen to me because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Breakfast. 
[00:22:00]  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the boy fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  God damn, was that funny?  That's the same clip.  Wait, I've got to compare the two.  You have to stop.  What a mess. 
[00:22:30]  It's the same.  She's doing pee-wee.  I would love to talk to the crew of this movie.  By the way, that scene was hysterical in the movie.  Wait.  We're doing the Mr. Cheese cereal.  I pity the boy.  Play that clip again and then we'll play the first part of the Rosie Club.  Morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  I pity the boy fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  What is this? 
[00:23:00]  Britney Spears?  No, not Britney.  I'm a bitch.  And you're an adult and you're new.  How do you know my name?  You're new.  Because I know everything.  Listen, I have to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolpho, and listen to me because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own. 
[00:23:30]  Morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the boy fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  Great.  Her great acting job as a retard is Pee Wee Herman.  She's ripping off Pee Wee.  Okay.  Where's the bus going to stop?  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:00]  Look who's on the bus.  Cowboy Curtis.  Hi, Cowboy Curtis.  Captain Carl.  Captain Carl.  Here comes Miss Yvonne, Captain Carl.  Unbelievable.  It's Pee Wee.  It's Pee Wee Herman.  I bet you, too.  I haven't seen the clip that she's not getting on a short bus.  No.  It's a regular bus, yeah.  It's a regular, like, city bus.  Oh, city bus.  Okay.  I wasn't sure if she was getting picked up for school or something.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  I do like the fact that the driver scolds her.  Yeah.  It's not a stop.  It's not a bus stop, you tard.  That would be worth it if everyone in the movie talked to her like that, no matter what she said.  No, it's not.  No, it's not, dummy.  Good try.  I'm sure you'd have that little chit-chat if that happened in New York City  with one of these New York City bus drivers.  I'm sure he would be just as polite.  You know what you'd hear?  Shut up.  Shut up and sit down. 
[00:25:00]  I'm awake.  We have to stop.  We have to stop.  And the other stop is...  No, we can shut up.  Shut up.  Sit in your seat or I'll throw your dumb ass off.  Right.  There's no chit-chat going on.  Sitting and chatting.  Shut up.  You and your fat stretch Armstrong legs.  No bend marks.  No bend marks at all.  Not even a dimple.  So what do you think is going to happen to Rosie in this movie?  We should take bets.  Oh, how does it go?  You know there's going to be that dramatic moment where maybe she gets lost or something  and now she's all confused looking at the big buildings. 
[00:25:30]  That's definitely going to be a scene where she gets lost.  She gets lost, starts looking at the big buildings, and eventually I bet you they find her at the end  and everything's going to be okay.  I think that's just a sub-thing.  I think the whole thing is going to be the fact that somebody will think that she's not capable of doing something.  Maybe even her sister will think that there's some kind of shortcomings because of her being a retard.  But then she will show everybody that she is indeed capable and inspire people. 
[00:26:00]  I think what's going to happen is that Rosie doesn't know how to express herself.  And they're going to wonder through the whole movie,  why does she buy tacos and then just rub her face in them and go...  It's going to be a story of inspiration.  Maybe the other sister, Annie McDowell, has some kind of illness.  Ah, maybe. 
[00:26:30]  They don't work.  No, you're on.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, I'm trying to use that phone.  That's when she's at a pay phone, I think.  Oh, these are more clips of Rosie.  Oh, okay.  These are more clips.  I thought we only had the one.  And then I guess she gets into an exchange about who the bus driver is,  and the bus driver doesn't know who she is.  I know you are, but what am I?  That didn't make sense.  I meant to do that.  Okay!  There you go.  Okay! 
[00:27:00]  And she has some fun in the movie, too.  Then she can't really hear the bus driver, I guess, at one point.  What?  What?  Yeah.  All right, now...  I cannot wait to see this movie, by the way.  Dude, I can't wait for this show.  For how I'm bashing this, cannot wait to see it.  I just want to know what the conflict's going to be.  There's going to be some stupid conflict.  Yeah.  Dumb conflict. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Can't just be her riding the bus the whole movie, can it?  No.  That'll be perfect.  I hope there's a little problem.  I hope there's something.  Does she do a crying scene, you think?  You think there's a retarded crying scene in it?  No, but I'm sure Bob Kelly will be crying when he watches the movie.  Him and his bum leg.  Jesus.  You know, it's so sweet.  The siblings, and I love that.  The blubbering gimp will be on the couch eating ho-hos, just going through tissues.  We're halfway through. 
[00:28:00]  Dennis Hopper's going to call.  There's a retard on the bus.  If you don't hand over the money, I'll have her talk until everybody kills himself.  Okay.  Did they chat a little after the clip?  Yeah, yeah.  We got that.  Here it is.  The fake laugh.  And then he laughs like a retard.  Yeah, this is where it picks up right after the clip plays, obviously.  They're going back to Tony live. 
[00:28:30]  Sweet.  Very sweet.  Good job, Ben.  Yeah.  I haven't been able to watch it.  You haven't watched it?  No.  I watched some of the early cuts when Angelica was putting it together, and honestly, all  credit of this movie belongs to her.  She's wonderful.  That woman is not only the best actor we have in America, but she's an amazing director.  And I had to cry a lot of this.  I was very scared of playing a role that's so challenging, and she made it easy.  Let me just give you a minute.  This is a kid who, her life becomes whole when she starts riding the bus. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  All the buses.  She has all the bus drivers, all the passengers.  She knows everybody and everything about them.  Right.  And that's sort of all she does.  She has a form of mental retardation.  She falls somewhere in the autism spectrum.  And she will only do the bus.  When the buses are off on Sunday, she just waits at home until the bus is, she's the first  one at the stop every time she tells people who's been on, who's been off, and she knows  everything there is to know about the buses.  Did you meet the real Beth? 
[00:29:30]  You know, I didn't.  Because she's a real person.  She sure is.  And her sister Rachel takes care of her, and Rachel sort of felt it would be very disruptive  for Beth to meet new people, and so I didn't meet her.  But I have a friend who has a sister named Cynthia who is very much like Beth, only instead  of the buses, she loves Broadway.  Oh, no kidding.  So she knows everything about Broadway, what show was on where and what theater on what  day, and so I went to see a few shows with Cynthia, and a lot of my character is based  on Cynthia, as well as a tape that I saw of Beth. 
[00:30:00]  But I never did get to meet her, although her whole dream of her life is to go to Disney  World.  So when the movie wrapped, I got her four tickets on the sleeper bus, the Greyhound bus  to go to Disney World.  Yeah, to meet new people.  Right, to meet new people on the bus is what I thought.  I hope it ends up on the side of a ditch on 95.  Hopefully she'll be well enough, you know, they have to wait until she's in a place where  she understands that she's going to go, and her therapist will go with her, but I hope  she gets to do that.  I wonder if they put her on the bus so the fucking dummy didn't charge the cockpit. 
[00:30:30]  Put her on the bus.  That's great.  That's great for the poor minimum wage Disney employees down there having to deal with that.  Yeah.  Oh.  Great.  Thank you, Rosie.  A sleeper bus.  You're just a wonderful American.  You always do the right thing, I gotta tell you.  Like it's not bad enough to be on a bus either, you know, to be on a bus, and this nut's got  to be on there.  Oh, little kid at Disney. 
[00:31:00]  Mommy, who's wearing the dumbbell costume?  Now, now.  Now, now.  Jesus.  Oh, that ain't good.  Oh, that bugged me.  What a method actress.  Yeah, I watched the tape.  Boy, way to throw yourself into the role, fatso.  Didn't even meet the girl.  I guess she would have been, like she said, to, which only goes to show you, she's probably  eight billion times more crazy in real life than Rosie's playing her up to be.  Rosie's going to play her up to be, you know, oh, look how sweet, and look how functional, 
[00:31:30]  and she should have got ready for the role by sniffing glue.  Before every take, put that bag up to your mouth, paint, glue, paint thinner.  Jesus, De Niro would have done it.  Hey, how did you prepare for the role?  Well, I crawled into my mother's womb, and I had her drink. 
[00:32:00]  Big bag of lead paint chips.  Just chowing down.  Seeing some stupid movie, making you believe it's popcorn.  Cutting her own oxygen off for way longer than she should.  And when I start to black out, take the bag off my head.  Hey, you know, De Niro would have done it that way.  Right. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone knows what he did to get ready for the Raging Bull.  That's a real actor.  That is a real actor.  That's this.  She watches a tape of a retard, and she's got it down.  Goes to a Broadway show with someone who just ruins the play for everyone.  Right.  Why is that person doing that?  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, just the shushes that must have been going on.  That's pretty.  The dress is up.  Shh.  Shut up.  Dolt. 
[00:33:00]  Imagine getting stuck behind that head.  Big, giant head.  Can't see the set.  I had to wait a year to get these tickets.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  This daytime hack just gets front row.  Steve C's there.  I just wanted to say, I thought you did a wonderful job.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Could you cut some liners for us?  Steve C's a big Broadway fan.  Oh, is he really?  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Goes to a lot of shows.  He doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Let's go to Zach.  Yo.  Come on, Zach.  Hey, I know the dramatic event in Rosie's movie.  Huh.  Bob Kelly's going to take her to the basement and hold a rock over her until she puts out.  Bunch it out, boys.  Have a good one.  You know.  What are you doing?  Ha ha.  I'm being gang banged.  Ha ha ha.  We haven't explored this emotional side of Bob Kelly.  We have to call him and see if this is the type of movie he would cry over. 
[00:34:00]  Hmm.  If he knows that we're all looking, he probably wouldn't.  Yeah.  Because he'd fight it, put a loan on his couch.  If he was home alone, he'd be blubbering.  With that dumb leg up, smoking a cigarette.  Dude, Bob will do this.  This is what Bob does.  He rehearses what he's going to say.  This is what a bore Bob is, and I hope you're listening, stupid.  You'll show up, and he'll just sit down, and he'll be like, you know, dude, and he'll  just start talking, and it's like, you rehearsing motherfucker.  Don't have these.  He rehearses, like, just conversation.  He, Bob wants to be smart, and he'll walk around the house, and he'll just go, you know,  dude, and he'll, like, pontificate and sound smart to him because he's an idiot, and then 
[00:34:30]  you sit down, and you're like, you are fucking, what is this droll nonsense you're firing at  me?  Dude, you know, the government, shut up.  Shut your mouth.  We've got to get Bob Kelly on today.  Ben's listening.  He'll try to get it.  I want to punch him right in his bad knee, right in that ripped tendon.  I want to just drill my fist.  You're calling him good.  Waylon from Georgia.  Yes, sir.  I have a little thing. 
[00:35:00]  I say we hang her, then we skew her, then we run her over.  I'm not even going to wait for him to finish.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was doing a lot.  All right.  Pat from Boston.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think on the bus, she's going to get her period, and her sister's going to show her how  to put on a pad, and then everything will be okay.  The pad.  She's fucking out.  Now, make sure you roll it up in tissue paper and put it in the nearest waste paper basket. 
[00:35:30]  And wave it in the bus driver's face.  Slap him in the face with it.  Blindside him.  While you're putting your fare in, just pull out your used pad and whack him in the face  with it.  And we'll see what kind of patience the bus driver really has.  Smack it over his mouth in a mock kidnapping.  Joe from Chicago.  What's cracking, boys?  What's up, Joe?  I've been listening to you guys for about two weeks now.  I am infected.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you, Joe.  Oh, is it me that those roads look like I have a retard already? 
[00:36:00]  Rosie?  She looks like she already has Down syndrome.  She kind of has that look, the big fat head.  They had to keep stopping her going, look, could you look a little smarter?  You know, this girl isn't really this stupid.  I think...  The only good ending for this movie would be if she gets hit by a bus.  That's the ironic ending.  Yeah, go for the ironic ending.  She actually gets hit by a bus.  The bus runs over her retard head and breaks its axle.  And she survives. 
[00:36:30]  I see that big thing pull away.  What happened?  What an annoyance.  You trying to go to work, read the Times?  And so-and-so, shut your face.  Ellis, some retard got on my bus today. 
[00:37:00]  Just yapping.  Yapping, yapping, yapping.  Big head takes up that whole mirror that they get to look in the backseat with.  To move that fat thing.  Do you bribe a dust?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  You're a retard.  Holy crap.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to drive some retards around. 
[00:37:30]  Stupid.  A mere bag of chromosomes?  Just wish I could do the voice.  I don't even have, I don't do the voice.  Gee, I never knew Davy Crockett was so dumb.  Harvey, Harvey, Harvey, I got a friend, Beth, smarter than you. 
[00:38:00]  One of these days, pal, right in the fat tongue.  Because you're a mongoloid.  A mongoloid. 
[00:38:30]  Mr. Fabasham, if you think I'm driving that retard around, it's out of the question, out of the question.  Beth, you've come back.  Oh, my head.  Yeah.  All right, let's move on here.  Let's go to Mandy. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, Mandy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Mandy?  Nothing.  I wanted to tell you that this is based on a true story.  Yes.  Yeah, Rosie was sort of saying that in that last clip, I guess.  Well, these are the true stories, so I know how it ends.  Oh.  So if you guys want to know.  Hell yeah, we want to know how it ends.  She gets a bum leg.  Well, Rosie, the retard.  She gets a bum leg and her sister has to come and it ruins her life.  And then the bus driver takes over and takes care of Rosie.  Oh! 
[00:39:30]  The bus driver takes care of her?  She's on the leg and she can't walk.  She has to be wheeled around.  And the bus driver comes to the rescue and takes care of her.  And she lives at his house.  Oh.  So it's not that great of an ending, but.  He lives at the bus driver's house.  Jeez, what's happening there?  Yeah, what is up with that?  A little diddle.  As long as she can take a little diddle.  All right, guys.  Pledge it out.  All right.  Bye-bye.  That's what he was saying to her.  Her little dumb face in the pillow. 
[00:40:00]  She's confused.  That's right.  Earn your keep.  Earn your keep.  What is Eric having?  I didn't know what the rest of this was.  Oh, I think I know what he's saying.  Oh, okay.  Eric from Staten Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a sneak peek of the movie.  The subplot is the bus gets a flat tire and Rosie with her retard strength picks up the bus because she didn't have a jack.  Watch it out.  With that retard strength. 
[00:40:30]  I got it.  This bit is picking up momentum, boys and girls.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  You're on the Opie and Anthony program.  How you guys doing?  We're having a good time today.  I hope someone's enjoying this crap.  Hey, I'll tell you what, man.  The retard stuff is not funny, but I was laughing my ass off.  That is some funny shit right there.  Oh, all right.  We turned you around a little bit.  Hey, get a load of retard over there. 
[00:41:00]  Mom.  Mom.  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday?  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes.  What about periods?  Do you have periods?  Yes.  All women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill? 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  I want to know if Susie has periods.  Susie?  Yes, Mom.  Jill wants to know something.  We want, Jill.  Susie, do you have periods?  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Ms. Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill, your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods. 
[00:42:00]  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  Well?  Well?  That's from the tradables audio, yes.  Good morning, Mr. Tampon!  You should see, did you get a chance to watch the clip of the period?  I still have not seen the video.  It's up on foundrymusic.com, right?  Who the little girl in this, the retarded little girl that they're teaching look like?  And then I realize, because I watch Close Encounters, like one of the aliens that come off of the ship, her face has that same look. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  And the older sister is telling her about periods, pulls down her pants, and shows this used pad.  This big old 50s pad.  You can get to the video clips by going to opianthony.com.  Yes.  I'm a little distracted because the listeners are taking over the bit slightly here.  Joe in Jersey.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  My favorite part of the movie is when Eric Logan takes her to his barber.  Punching out. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, God damn.  Oh, over the fence with that one.  The listeners are taking over, Anthony.  Let's go to Tom on Long Island.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jimmy, love you.  Thanks, bud.  Hey, I heard the sequel to this takes place in Israel, and Rosie's wearing a big, puffy coat on the bus.  Punching out, guys. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  Duke in Jersey.  What's up, Duke?  Duke?  Yes, I'm here.  What's up, Duke?  Oh, I was just going to say that Rosie has to go and rent out all of Giovanni Ribisi's movies to research a retard role.  Yes, Giovanni Ribisi.  Rosie.  Extraordinaire.  All right.  We have a third clip, Anthony, from the Tony Danza show from yesterday.  Is this another clip for the movie or the same clip? 
[00:44:00]  No, it's the same clip.  Oh, hold on, buddy.  It's the same clip, but without the Tony Danza stuff around it.  It's just the clip from the movie.  Oh, man.  We're going to have to wait until Monday.  I can't believe we have to wait.  Monday, we're going to have probably 20 clips.  Why couldn't we get a screen or copy of this?  They wouldn't send one over?  We should be able to see these in advance so we can comment.  We're probably going to give this show great ratings.  People are going to watch it just to see Rosie's standout performance as a retard.  You know, it's going to be hilarious, the confusion at the hallmark offices when they 
[00:44:30]  get the overnight ratings.  Why is this show number one, men, 18 and 34?  We made this movie for, you know, middle-aged housewives.  Housewives.  That's wonderful.  Let's listen to the clip one more time, then.  This is the only one we got.  I know.  I can't wait.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  Okay.  No, not Britney.  I'm Cole Best.  And you're a Redolfo, and you're new. 
[00:45:00]  How do you know my name?  You're new, because I know everything.  Well, listen.  You have to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg, and she has to go to the  doctor at 11, so stop on Carlton Street, Redolfo, and listen to me, because I only tell  you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay. 
[00:45:30]  I pity the poor fool.  Don't eat my cereal.  The pack has a swollen leg.  Aw.  See, they're making Beth look like she's the helpful one.  Right.  Like she knows everybody in the community.  How could she be retarded, yet she knows everything.  She could remember the names of the passengers and the bus drivers and the bus routes.  It's amazing.  It's special.  And the only thing she enjoys is riding the bus.  Riding the bus.  And that's the only thing she can't do anymore. 
[00:46:00]  There you go.  Because she has a bum leg.  She's got a bum leg.  So she can't ride the bus?  Yeah.  And that was her whole life.  It must be like, what?  What kind of bum leg?  A Mabel King bum leg?  Because that's a bum leg.  What kind of bum leg?  But she can't ride the bus, and the bus driver takes her in.  Oh.  You know there's something going on there.  Absolutely.  His poker buddies come over.  They'll jump on.  Hey.  Um.  George?  Hey, guys.  What's up, George?  Hey, the interview between Tony and Rosie. 
[00:46:30]  Which one was the idiot?  Or the retard?  Ah, fuck.  Punching out.  You sound.  You are.  You had a good one, too.  You stuttering prick, you?  Which one's the first?  Nervous.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  Nervous zilch.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum.  XM202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Nice tit.  Whose tit is that?  Eric.  Oh, I thought you were looking over there.  It's great.  Eric, during the entire show, we'll just go to Mr. Skin and pop up random celebrities that 
[00:47:00]  are topless and nude.  Oh, my God.  How many times have I been sitting here going, wow, look at that.  It completely takes me out of the game.  Who is that?  I'm not complaining, yeah, but it does take you out of the game.  That's some, who is that again?  Sophia Marceau.  Yeah.  And she was in?  A bunch of foreign films.  A bunch of foreign films.  A bunch of foreign films.  Her boob fell out at the Cannes Film Festival.  It's a European.  Get it.  The Cannes Film Festival.  Hey now.  Hey now.  Hey now.  All right.  We're not here.  We're going to be back tomorrow for another live O.P. and Anthony program.  But in the meantime, it's Rosie the Retard Part 2. 
[00:47:30]  This is where it gets really, really good.  Yeah.  That's all we need to say here.  Get it.  This is what we talked about.  Wait.  The Hallmark cards.  Shut up.  But I want to.  I had a perfect out there, dude.  Shush.  Shh.  All right.  Let's redo that.  No, we're not redoing it.  Just listening.  Redoing it.  It's your mistake.  You look like the idiot, and it stays.  I want to look professional.  Impossible.  Just listen to this.  All right.  Hear it.  You shut up.  I want to get the hell out of here. 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  Sorry.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Oh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  What do you want to do?  Riding on the bus?  Yeah.  Let's get into that a little bit.  I just think we should watch where the jokes go.  I think that.  Yeah.  Let's not target the mentally challenged.  I agree with you.  Yeah.  Take the high road.  Yeah.  Jack.  All right.  I like how, actually, even though it's radio, he puts the serious face on. 
[00:48:30]  You know, guys, there's not even a hint of a smile.  I'm a method actor.  I can't help it.  He really has to get into the character.  You know, all right, let me really think that I don't want to make jokes about this.  All right.  All right.  I'll wait.  Okay.  Here was Rosie Odom.  I got to admit, I took a peek after Family Guy.  It was not just an awful movie because of the content and Rosie O'Donnell being a horrible 
[00:49:00]  actress and just running through as a parody of a retarded person.  The movie itself, taken just as a movie, was so bad.  It was so disjointed and cliches left and right.  They kept throwing in these little things that lasted for a second that were supposed to make you think about something, I guess.  I don't know.  There was one part where they tried to get into this little story of this pervert that drives around and gives Rosie O'Donnell's retard character a stuffed animal in the car and goes, 
[00:49:30]  here you go, and he looks all ratty, and he pulls up slowly as she's walking on the sidewalk, and she grabs the stuffed animal and then walks a little like, oh, no, and puts it in the garbage and goes,  that guy always tries to give me things.  And then that was it.  Dude, it lasted for like five seconds.  Like, oh, the retards have to watch for the perverts.  Yes, okay.  I understand where they were going.  Because that's what's happening out there. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Is the pervert retarded, too?  When you looked at.  I think that you're missing the message, Anthony.  Yeah, what about that?  The message there, that's the message to the parents, where if you have one of these, this is what you should do with it.  Walk right outside, lift the lid.  Toss it in the garbage.  But they tried little things like that, like they were trying to make these points, but they were covered so quickly, like, okay, let's cover the pervert trying to pick her up.  All right, let's get the mean, intolerant people on the bus.  Like, she gets on the bus, and there's the bus drivers, which are all, every one of them, very tolerant, very nice to her, very understanding. 
[00:50:30]  And then a couple of passengers that, as viewers, you're supposed to hate.  Because they're like, what is she doing on this bus?  She doesn't have the proper past.  She's annoying.  And they're saying all this out loud, like no one would ever speak this shit.  You say it under your breath, and you kick them while they're not looking.  Things like, fun things like that.  Pinch their side fat.  Yeah.  Oh, get away from me. 
[00:51:00]  And then one of the most unrealistic parts of the movie, when somebody getting on the bus needed a nickel and didn't have a nickel, and a black gentleman actually gave a nickel.  Oh, that was, I saw that scene.  I'm like, stop it.  That was Rosie's sister there.  He looked like a thug.  He looked like a thug, but he's very charitable.  Well, then she tries to give him a dollar, and he's like, yo, lady, you can't buy anything for five cents nowadays.  Uh-huh.  Something like that.  And then there was one intolerant black woman.  Rosie gets on the bus, and she starts making retard faces at these two black children that are sitting there. 
[00:51:30]  And the black woman saw that the children were making faces back, and she kind of takes them by the hands and moved her seat.  She went to the back of the bus, which somebody on Whack Bag, right when it happened, wrote, well, I guess old habits die young.  Or something like that.  Old habits die hard.  Oh, I suck.  But apparently, what's your favorite song, Only the Good Die Hard? 
[00:52:00]  Only the Good Die Hard.  Oh, what a tool.  I stink.  Now we know what you meant.  Yeah.  So did I.  Fortunately, it came out of my mouth like diarrhea.  That's all right.  Jim in Philly thought the movie wasn't that bad.  Jim?  What?  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  All right.  I like you very much.  Yeah, I'm a faggot.  Hi, Jimmy.  I bought your new CD.  It's pretty good.  Thank you very much.  Why are you breathing like you just ate it? 
[00:52:30]  Because I'm a fat fuck.  That's honest.  Well, there goes that question.  You like the movie there, Jim?  Yes, I do.  I had a retarded sister, and it brought back a lot of things.  Did she ride the bus?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  No.  It brought back a lot of what?  Like a lot of memories?  A lot of bad.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of bad.  My brother and I were constantly in fights, you know, protecting her.  And, you know, because people would make fun of her and shit.  That seemed very unrealistic.  Yeah.  What would they say to your sister? 
[00:53:00]  What would they say to her?  A lot.  You know, hey, you fucking retards.  Okay.  Yeah.  But she didn't talk like fucking Pee Wee Herman.  No.  Nah.  Is she still around?  No, she died when she was 26.  hello yes what that that you guys can't that's that's not cool man what did she pass away from 
[00:53:30]  uh well they said natural causes but i suspect it was sleep apnea  why a lot of uh retarded people have the sleep apnea well she was heavy too and i have sleep  apnea because i'm a very heavy person i thought it might have been that big thick tongue getting  in the way while she was sleeping god i could have been she ain't heavy she's my retarded sister  that's true and i do drive a bus in philadelphia we do get a lot of retarded you do are you very 
[00:54:00]  are you the tolerant bus driver uh sometimes sometimes not yeah wow when they stand up at  the bus and they start fucking hollering and screaming you know you got time to put it  yeah that's great that's what you want to deal with he had a sister that was retarded he's not  tolerant you just want to get through your day driving a bus and you're you get this in the back  make somebody stop at that other bus stop but the one truth in the story was is a lot of them that get

[00:55:30]  what else were you gonna say about this movie uh a lot another thing that was going on during the  whole thing and i don't know if this was just part of rosie's contract or the character was supposed  to be like this she was eating in every scene eating in every single scene and uh she was unhealthy  she went to the doctor and the doctor told her she's overweight and stuff and somebody pointed out  uh on the message board that um this woman is this doctor is bashing rosie's character yet it's 
[00:56:00]  still rosie that she's telling is unhealthy the only difference is this uh uh retarded character  didn't wash her hair that was like the only difference between the retard and rosie so this  woman saying that how unhealthy and fat rosie is as the retard meanwhile she didn't have padding on  or anything she's just fat that's great so they're pounding her that's awesome yeah fat clay  legs with no ben march and you know i know it's very you know hack as a a comics to talk of the big

[00:57:00]  yeah i i got jfk yeah i got you didn't really go over well though all right you want to play some  clips and say die young well he did okay here's rosie's character on the phone i guess  i'm trying to use the phone no that's peewee yes daddy hi honey you okay yes i'm okay i'm okay 
[00:57:30]  because i'm the sheriff yeah you have to take me to super save tomorrow because i have a sale  okay i'm gonna pick you up at six yeah six thirty i love you i have to go i have to go catch a bus  i have to go catch a bus oh you are a bus you pig  okay why are you so tolerant of the retard i'm the sheriff no you're not stupid  i'm the sheriff somebody had the storyline all wrong also they told us that at the end she gets a bum leg 
[00:58:00]  yeah yeah and has to live with them and then i realized that was the storyline of bill  somebody was uh uh trying to fool us oh okay that was the storyline of uh old bill we don't have  our bill clips played a retard we have to get the bill clips it was i had a bad leg and i have to live  with barry and uh that's what happened he had a bum leg he would have had to go back to the home  oh okay he lived with someone got one past i know i didn't realize it until last night when i'm like 
[00:58:30]  hey wait it didn't end like that one of our favorite comedies of course it is how did it end  i didn't see it well it ended uh uh the sister well is that the father that she's talking to on the  phone he dies he winds up dying and uh now she he took care of rosie's character um for the most  part rosie lived alone but i guess he uh helped her out whatever so now the sister who is very  successful career woman has to now come and kind of take care of her a little bit and uh leave her job 
[00:59:00]  for a while and she winds up breaking up with her fiancee because uh uh of the problem with the  sister and yeah that would happen in real life yeah of course because damn it sorry and uh it's it's  now the the movie is pretty much the sister trying to get a better understanding of her retarded sister  because they haven't been together in years she's been busy career girl you know doesn't even  acknowledge she's got this retard uh for a sister what's there to understand nothing this movie was 
[00:59:30]  so shallow it had nothing to it they can't even watch the same tv programs so they drive on the  bus together and then rosie tries hooking her up with the bus drivers this is my sister and she's  broke up with a boyfriend and she reads books and she oh and it's and she just kind of smiles like  it's okay instead of slapping her on the face and telling her to shut up like any normal human  would do should have pinched the back of her arm and just said shut up yes shut up ow  here's the argument on the stairs anthony what was this about um i don't know i couldn't even 
[01:00:00]  understand the movie i was a retard watching it what do you think you are a hippopotamus the way  you clock down the steps every morning some people are still sleeping not you you're not sleeping  you're complaining that's what you're doing you're the hippopotamus yeah that was her walking  downstairs wow there's a lot of fat jokes in this movie huh well yeah well she's fat yeah big black

[01:02:00]  drivel just awfulness like the people in the bus the angry people you know why don't you get a job  instead of being on the government dole and you're supposed to look over and go yeah that person's mean  and awful oh and it's like every two seconds these little things were popping up the intolerant gang  of white guys that beat up the black uh that were trying to beat up the black her black boyfriend  of course and he knows taekwondo the boy yeah rosie's hearted black uh boyfriend so he got the 
[01:02:30]  retard strength too yeah yeah the retard strength and kicked ass gotta be kind of stupid to take on a  guy like that people started uh uh getting ready to attack him and rosie goes it's getting hot in here  it's getting hot in here and he ran over in his taekwondo duds they criticized her and he went you  motherfucker chris on long island chris what's up fellas hey don't think that uh that rosie sounds  like bonnie gumbel from the simpsons all right that's good sometimes it's peewee sometimes it's 
[01:03:00]  bonnie it's just minus the burp right that's good the worst part of it is i was only able to whack my  bag twice during that piece though very good guy had a really good call so wait not only was rosie  a retard but she was in oh oh oh oh a two-time disappointer of the family  oh my god oh sounds like it just couldn't get any worse daddy meet i stand corrected 
[01:03:30]  okay at ten that's nice and both races will be destroyed they'll create a mongrel race  jesus christ that's great andy mcdowell was the sister yes she was the sister and uh i guess the  beginning shot the opening shot of the movie was pretty good she's kind of laying back on the bed  and her nips were showing through the sweater so that that was like the best part of the movie 
[01:04:00]  i'm my savior i'm not your savior i'm just beth cool beth my girlfriend  oh that's boring clothes what am i scaring you what made it scare you  uh...  here are no mind  on the street  just don't make eye contact  i'm having you

[01:05:00]  I'm hearing you  when you're going to take me for a ride in your car  in a green car, my case worker  oh Olivia  yes Olivia  she's pretty and she's nice  oh that's a house where me and Eugene live  I think he's a jerk  you think he's a jerk Rick  I don't think he's a jerk  I think he's a little impatient  yeah well he put up that sign in the bathroom 
[01:05:30]  that says only employees can use it  that didn't stop you though did it  no because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom  if I use it I don't think I'm hurting anybody  yeah that's great  employees work all day  sometimes I go in there and I'm going out there  like all the bathrooms just to wash my hands and make them mad  just to wash my hands  how stupid can one person be  sometimes I just wash my hands 
[01:06:00]  you work hard and that dummy walks in and takes one of her retard dumps  there's gum and pennies in it  little shards of glass and fur  that was part of the movie was that she ate everything 
[01:06:30]  which is good for Rosie O'Donnell but as a kid they did a lot of flashbacks where they showed her as a little kid  which is great for the kid  for the kids image as an actress  you know you're a really good fat retard  here you go you're the fat retarded girl  and she was eating everything  she was outside eating dirt  they had her eating dirt  they had her eating paint  she was trying to do a little painting and she was eating the paint  and that's what Rosie grew into  somebody that just  oh my god 
[01:07:00]  the inside of the toilet looks like Dreyfus's living room in Close Encounters  this means something  I've got a big  there's a mountain in my toilet  I don't know  maybe if I put some lines in the side  it'll ring a bell  be realistic 
[01:07:30]  be realistic  open your eyeballs  and you can see that  he's a little bit of a jerk  oh Shanann  you're grabbing  yeah I'm big as a truck  sit here sit here  you want a few little kids  this is a pregnant woman  hold on  go ahead  put your hands on my tummy

[01:09:30]  what  what  ha ha  ha ha ha  peewee  uh  she's  yeah and um  sweet corn smile  from Syracuse  Rosie sounds like  the Saturday Night Live  skit Amy Poehler  does as a little girl  yeah  rack rack rack rack rack rack  rack rack rack rack  hey  over here  ha ha  oh she is awful  oh this is great  it is so bad  it's such a bad  you can't get over 
[01:10:00]  the put on retard  that she's doing  this over the top  bad  that's what I say  oh it's horrible  so far  Henry and those other  two guys  are my favorite  characters on television  Henry  that sounds like  the cookie monster  a little bit too  c is for chromosome  which I do not have  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  today's show is  sponsored by the letter  U 
[01:10:30]  ugh  ha ha ha  ha ha  alright I guess  this is where  the movie gets  very dramatic  Anthony  the father has  a heart attack  hangers are more  for just than  hanging your  clothes  ha ha ha  hangers are used  for things  other than  just hanging  In your clothes.  The father has a heart attack?  Yes, this is where the father dies. 
[01:11:00]  I guess they have to call up Rosie, and she runs to the hospital,  and it's trying to be a touching scene, and it was nothing but humor.  Just funny.  When was the last time she saw her father?  Talked to him all the time on the phone.  He was much too busy to visit her?  No, no, I guess he would visit her, too, and give her things.  So, you know, I guess they were close.  What?  I tried to meet you at home, but I missed you.  I've already left.  Yeah, well, I was here.  Would you like a cookie?  Chocolate flavor? 
[01:11:30]  Very nutritious.  Eating again.  No, thanks.  But, um, is there someplace we can go?  What for?  Bet your dad, uh, I'm afraid your father's had a heart attack.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, my dad's taking me to the super save.  I'm going to go get rich.  What?  Beth.  Ow.  Beth.  Um, slow down.  You've had, you've had surgery.  I think you might, you might just want to...  Beth.  Beth.  Beth.  No. 
[01:12:00]  Excuse me.  Sorry.  Excuse me.  I'm just going to...  The running retard scene.  The panicking retard.  Beth's dad is in the hospital.  Massive heart attack.  You okay, Beth?  Yeah, time to start the bus.  Let's go.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Ah, you've got slow, Rick.  I'm going to report to you.  Beth.  No.  No, Olivia.  Everybody has a schedule.  I've got a schedule.  I'm going to have you to me, boss, today.  That's why it is.  Beth, can I call someone for you?  Rick, you're cute, but your clothes are faded. 
[01:12:30]  They're not very nice.  But you look at my clothes.  They're very bright.  I give everybody lots of color.  Oh, where is it?  St. Matthew's.  Beth, listen to me.  No.  Your dad's in the hospital.  Yeah.  I have to go to the hospital.  I'll take you there.  It's not your route.  There's other people on the bus, by the way.  And he's just going to, you know, hey, we've got to go to the hospital.  That would happen in real life.  Excuse me.  That would happen.  Fired.  Where's your pass, fatso?  If I don't have it, then get off. 
[01:13:00]  You would be fired for that.  Of course.  You can't take the bus off the route.  All right.  Now she's visiting her father in the hospital.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no.  We're excited.  Where's my daddy?  Where's my daddy?  Oh!  He's in a coma.  He's unconscious.  He won't even know you're here.  Yes, he will, because he's knowing.  I think it's important for Beth to see her dad.  Oh!  I want to see you!  Oh!  The father's, like, finally in peace. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, daddy!  I didn't want you to see him this way.  He's just pretending he can't hear her.  What I said to you.  I didn't hurt you.  It's me, the sheriff.  Dad!  Can you hear me?  Oh, dad!  You are going to take me to the super safe today.  You have to wake up.  You have to wake up!  It's you, me!  Dad, we make a good team.  You're going to kill me!  You're not going to die! 
[01:14:00]  Is he okay?  Beth, please, not so loud.  But he's not going to die, right?  Maybe you'd like to come outside and sit down.  Baby, you should do something.  You just stand there.  You're doing nothing.  Beth, please, calm down.  It's time we let your dad rest.  No, it's not time!  I'm going to stay here!  It's not time!  You have to cooperate.  You are not my mother!  You're not!  That doesn't mind, darling!  I was.  I'd have thrown myself down the stairs. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was the heart-tugging scene.  That was the...  Rosie crying.  Now she's got to move on and get along without her dad to help her.  That's where her sister is.  I mean, there's a ton of clips still to go here.  Which ones do you want to go to?  I don't know.  Let me see.  They all stink.  Birthday party on the bus.  How about the ones where bees sting her fat legs while she rolls around confused in the yard? 
[01:15:00]  It was just such a horrible movie.  It's just her walking around pretty much doing what we've already heard.  This bad retard voice put in situations that garner her no sympathy whatsoever from the audience watching.  She's just an annoying...  Oh, well, there's the Hallmark retard commercial.  All right.  They were...  Now, during this whole movie, which was sponsored by Hallmark 29, sponsored by Hallmark, every commercial break, there were like two of these drama commercials. 
[01:15:30]  They went on and on forever.  And it was supposed to, you know, be feel good.  And one was how this little boy comes home from school and his teacher gave him a card because he was nice to another student who was, like, developmentally challenged, I believe.  And the mother's very proud of her son for helping.  And another one was this woman who was very successful comes back to visit a teacher that taught her.  This old man, I guess it looked like he was retiring, too, gives him a card and stuff. 
[01:16:00]  And he says, wow, you've done very well in life.  What are you, a stockbroker or a lawyer?  And she goes, no, I'm a teacher.  And then Bob Kelly bursts into tears.  What do the cards say?  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  Thanks for wrecking our family photographs.  You genetic disaster.  You.  And then there was this one. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Which was, I guess, this woman.  She's in her office.  She comes across as a very stuffy, all-business kind of woman.  She leaves the office and goes to, I guess it's her brother, her resorted brother's house.  Yes, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I'm just thinking of another card you give to the retard.  It's a picture of a dumpster in the back of a Planned Parenthood. 
[01:17:00]  And the card says, wish you were here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm crying.  Yeah, so she goes over to her brother's house, I guess it is. 
[01:17:30]  And he's got Down syndrome.  But he's very self-sufficient.  And she gives him the card.  It's her interacting with her retarded brother.  Hey, Dave.  Hi, Trish.  Come on in.  Can you show me around?  Sure.  This is my living room.  Great.  And this is my TV.  And down the hall. 
[01:18:00]  That's where I jerk off 23 hours a day.  This is my bedroom.  He talks like Doug out and Doug.  And this is my kitchen.  What are you cooking over there?  Oh, I'm making vegetable soup.  That looks good.  Hungry?  I'm always hungry.  Not for your vegetable soup.  Sticky, nasty fingers in there.  Look at that.  Vegetable soup.  It's a bowl with three of his friends.  I'm so proud of you. 
[01:18:30]  He's reading the card.  I'm so proud of you, too, Trish.  They had a close-up of his hands as he's opening the card.  Right.  And you would think that they would have told him, hey, clip your nails.  He had these Ricky the Intern nails. 
[01:19:00]  They're big and pointy.  And they were on the ends of fingers that looked like, you ever see a gecko?  The lizards?  Like they got those fat fingers on those little stubby.  What's that look like?  Like gecko hands.  His hands were all burnt because he wasn't heating up the soup.  He was heating up his own hand.  He was stirring it with his hand.  I called the carrots Bob.  Shut up.  Stupid Hallmark cards.  God, they got cards for everything.  Now they got cards for retards. 
[01:19:30]  You just learned to wipe your bottom.  Happy 35th birthday.  Bingo Pants from whackbag.com.  Bingo Pants.  How you doing, guys?  What's up?  I want to see if, since Hallmark produced this thing, do you think they're now going to have a section of cards for retards?  Like they can get their own parents and anniversary cards in.  Do you guys, thanks for not taking a hanger to me.  Yeah.  Back for now, guys. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  That'll be good.  Too late.  And I noticed a couple more clips here that we want to play.  All right.  Let her rip.  Well, Beth wants to have a baby.  Oh, right.  This might be worth playing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wanted to have a baby because she's in love with her boyfriend, Jesse, the black retarded guy.  And they are having sex.  But they had a flashback scene where apparently the sister there and the father were a little leery of this whole thing.  So they had her tubes tied. 
[01:20:30]  And she couldn't have a baby, and she was very disappointed with that.  Smart parents, though.  Smart father and sister.  They should have given her a hysterectomy.  But I stopped myself short because I didn't have anything else.  And I was actually hoping the clip would play.  And then you stopped it, and I'm like, ah.  Could have tagged it with a spade shovel.  There we go. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Sinead, your baby.  Can I hold her?  Oh, Beth, I don't know.  It's so tiny.  Of course you can hold her.  Are you sad?  Ten years since I can't have a baby.  That's what I'm thinking.  Are you sorry now that you can't have a baby?  I don't know.  I don't know the baby.  Leave that baby where it cry all the time.  But I would love it.  That's the most important thing. 
[01:21:30]  We thought we were doing the right thing.  Now look, Beth.  How much did you do with this, Jesse?  Okay, hold it.  Flashback.  Flashback.  This father asking, how much did you do with this, Jesse?  Like, they're trying to figure if she's sexually active.  And if she is, they've got to get her tubes tied.  And one of the highlights of the movies are, later on in this scene, I guess it's in the clip,  as they're wheeling her gurney through the hospital.  She has a few comments to make.  I also have to know, did the camera pan to her legs and the baby legs, and you couldn't tell which was which? 
[01:22:00]  Big, fat, dimpled knee.  The thing is, you could get pregnant if you're not careful.  And everyone knows you're not very careful.  I'm sure this Jesse guy is very nice, but do you really want to have a baby?  I must.  Babies are not dolls.  They're not puppies or kittens.  Babies get sick.  They need constant attention.  How would you manage that, Beth?  You can't even hook your own bra. 
[01:22:30]  Do you really want to take that chance?  Do you want to have a baby?  Hook my own bra.  They make them without hooks.  Can't hook her own bra because she's too fat.  Big pig.  Has nothing to do with being retarded.  Then they show her getting her tubes tied. 
[01:23:00]  Do we have that?  I don't know.  What track is that?  I don't think, I don't think.  You better have that gurney wheeling down that hallway.  I don't know if we do.  With her comments.  Let me try this.  There's a conversation about getting her tubes tied.  All right, let's hear that.  I don't know if this is, I don't know.  I'm good with kids.  That's why I say because it's true.  That's right, Beth.  And kids love you.  Yes.  I can't have any kids.  Beth.  That's true.  They have my tubes tied up. 
[01:23:30]  Tied up.  But that's okay, because then I don't have to worry when I'm with Jesse.  You know what I mean?  Do you like marshmallows?  I love marshmallows.  Me too.  We got something in common.  The kind with the sugar on the top?  I haven't had those.  I have them sometimes.  They're holidays.  They make them for holidays.  Hi there, Jesse.  Jesse!  Jesse!  That's a good man! 
[01:24:00]  That's my boyfriend, Jesse!  We know Beth, so shut up.  What did he say?  So shut up.  We know Beth, so shut up.  I don't know, Ann.  I think that's it.  Aw, they're wheeling her down the hospital hallway on the gurney, all ready to get her tubes tied.  And she starts moving around.  She goes, ah, I changed my mind!  I changed my mind!  And she's screaming, I changed my mind.  Hey, keep wheeling her right through.  It's ain't your decision to make, stupid.  That's right.  I don't care what the birth certificate says.  Mind of a six-year-old. 
[01:24:30]  And they clip her anyway.  All right, then it's Beth and Rachel say goodbye, and then Beth back to riding the bus.  Everything's all...  Oh, it ends happy?  All night.  Yeah, it ends the same way.  It ends, actually, with the clip that we played on Friday.  Oh, okay.  Ew!  We're done with this.  There was nothing to this.  This was a non-movie.  Aside from her walking around sounding like Pee-wee retarded.  But, oh, two just...  Imagine her and that black guy just going at it in bed. 
[01:25:00]  But, you know what?  You've got to think.  It's probably pretty cool for them.  It's just pure pleasure.  There's nothing rattling around in that head to distract you.  That genital mixture probably smells like a Reuben.  Oh, God!  Two unwashed fat dopes.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not.  You sightless taut.  Your dog's just shit on my rug.  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a skit?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:25:30]  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, Bill Burr sitting in, and Brother Joe.  Everyone is here just to say, hey, what's up?  I hope you're enjoying the worst of.  We'll be back tomorrow for another Opie and Anthony program.  But first, we're going to have a little thing here.  An old bit where we talked about after-school specials.  Everyone remembers these, right?  Come home from school and you turn on the after-school special.  It would teach you a little something.  Cookies and milk.  That would have been nice if your mic was on.  What?  I said cookies and milk after-school special. 
[01:26:00]  I already heard that.  You just said it.  I know.  It's never funny the second time.  Never.  Should have come with something else.  Scotch.  I know.  You should have said, like, a stepfather creeping in, giving a breast exam.  I love that guy.  After-school specials on the Opie and Anthony program.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo mÃ¡s mal de Opie and Anthony en XM2.  Cero dos. 
[01:26:30]  Tottle from New York.  Trying to be a comedian, but very funny here.  To after-school specials where the chick has the problem.  The sicker the problem, the more the bats.  Now, that's a fun new game.  To after-school special.  Starring Valerie Bertinelli.  Bertinelli.  Meredith Baxter Burnt.  Yes.  That's a lifetime favorite.  It's about latchkey kids that have to come home, and the single parent is at work.  So they have to heat up their own Campbell soup. 
[01:27:00]  I'm Sarah, and I cut.  I'm a cutter.  I'm a cutter.  Oh, you tell me.  I thought it was drugs and sex.  It turns out she's a cutter.  I didn't know about this.  And then the shrink has to tell the parents, this is a very popular and serious thing that happens these days.  A cutter.  A cutter.  A cutter.  Those were always the best.  The after-school specials. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, you take it.  I'm Beth, and I pull out my eyelashes.  Yes.  Because my mommy didn't love me.  Susan, portrait of a teenage slut.  You take my breath away.  I don't know what to say.  You take my breath away.  That was an after-school special song.  Of course it was.  I remember that.  What was that story about?  Take my breath away.  Remember the one, Eve Plum was in Jan Brady. 
[01:28:00]  It was Sarah, portrait of a teenage alcoholic or something.  Nice.  And, yeah.  That wasn't an after-school special, but it was one of those family movies that you watched with your parents.  And she was just a raging drunk in school with a little vodka bottle.  And it was like, it's Jan Brady.  I'm drinking with short glass.  It was great.  I used to love those after-school specials.  Yeah.  Tunnel makes a good point. 
[01:28:30]  The sicker they are.  Oh, yeah.  There was the one about the girl and, God, what was it?  Oh, the father was the kid toucher.  And her father was doing things to her.  And it was Ted Danson, I think.  Yeah, Ted Danson was the father, and he's touching the kid.  That one rocked.  And the kid was too scared to tell anyone?  Yeah.  Don't remember the name of that one, either.  But then, you know, justice always prevails.  And then there was the one with the, like I was saying, the guy that played the school admissions guy from Risky Business. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Mazer.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, and he was the kid toucher, and it was the little kid from one of the vacation movies.  It was the girl.  Was she regarded as a girl?  Yeah, and his name was Howard.  Yeah, I was.  Yeah.  You saw that one too, Rick.  And he was taking pictures of her on the rock in the park.  And just at first, he's just taking regular pictures. 
[01:29:30]  And he's like, okay, why don't you pull your shirt down a little bit?  And she's like, oh, Howie.  And he starts snapping the pictures.  He goes, it's okay, you're like a supermodel.  You're like Farrah Fawcett.  Just take your shirt down a little bit.  I felt disgusting watching this show.  Okay.  And then the mother bursts in his apartment, and there's like boys on the floor eating pizza.  And the mother starts beating the crap out of him.  It was great. 
[01:30:00]  Richard Mazur was his name.  We have a song to play, though.  And this is...  Oh.  This will bring back memories to the older listeners of our show.  After school special music.  Yeah.  Who did this?  Rex Smith.  Rex Smith.  Remember Rex Smith?  There he goes.  You, I don't know what to say.  You take my breath away.  You're every song I sing. 
[01:30:30]  Was this the after school special where Helen Hunt got PCP?  Remember that one?  Or is this the Scott Baio after school special, Stone?  You take my breath away.  Take your bomb and kick it off now.  You, you, you smile and it's okay.  Okay.  Take my breath away.  Oh, ah.  What a promised dream.  Anyway. 
[01:31:00]  On a sizzling summer day.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You take my breath away.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  For the magic of the sunrise.  What about our huge big hooters, huh?  I thought I told you to shut up.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  For you, you take my breath away. 
[01:31:30]  So bad.  And I don't know what to say.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Don't you fall around like a dog.  Sweet.  Merciful crap.  A poosah.  Hey, he keeps licking his finger.  Hit me.  What the hell were you thinking?  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  I smell ramen poontane. 
[01:32:00]  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  Ha, ha, ha.  You take my breath away.  The crap is my kid.  And I don't know what to say.  You're a kid toucher.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Cause you take my breath away.  You're a filthy whore.  Hey.  Take my breath away.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is horrible. 
[01:32:30]  Virgil.  Look what I did to you again.  Your days of finger banging old Mary Gay rutt rutt rutt through her pretty pig panties are over.  Nice head, dick.  Shut up, dummy.  How's that for a topper? 
[01:33:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Rex Smith.  I know.  I think what that after school special was about was the chick was in love with him, right?  Cause he was also in the after school special.  And the chick was like in love with this guy.  But I can't remember what happened.  Yeah, but wasn't it, uh, uh, uh, McNichols?  Christy McNichol?  Wasn't she in that one?  She might have been.  No, wait, wait.  Someone's got to get.  Maybe the show Family. 
[01:33:30]  Wasn't he in Family?  Someone's got to get us the synopsis of that after school special where Mick Smith sung that song.  So, I remember it was pretty, uh, pretty intense.  Pretty intense.  That was great.  Doug knows what the movie's about.  Let's see.  Doug.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  How's it going?  The, uh, the 13-year-old girl, uh, on the show was an actress who was also on that sitcom Fish.  Wow.  Fish?  Yeah, with Abe Vigoda.  Yes, the spinoff of Pony Mellon.  And she falls for Rex Smith.  He's like a 21, 22-year-old guitar player. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And she says she's like 17, and she even, uh, denies being Jewish.  Oh, there's the thought.  It's like she, she drives up to a Catholic school, puts on a Catholic uniform.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  I swear.  And that's when that, uh, that, uh, that song comes on.  So, the big deal was that she was only 13 and not, uh, 17, like she told Rex Smith's character?  Yeah, exactly.  And at the end, he, he, he, he, like, blows her off.  Because he knows he can get in trouble.  And at the end, he just goes for it anyway.  You see him making out as the credits are rolling. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was it called, was it called Fallen Angel?  No, Fallen Angel was the one with Richard Mazur.  Right.  And, uh, and Dana Hill was her name.  She was that, like, fidget kid with, uh, bad kidneys or something.  Yeah, it was a real sappy movie.  Very good.  Thank you, Doug.  All right, man.  All right.  And, of course, Richard Mazur in Fallen Angel was, like, the soccer coach guy.  It's always the soccer coach.  And they, they had won a game.  And he's like, I'll take you all out for pizza.  He was the definitive kid toucher back then when that movie came out. 
[01:35:00]  It was, it was so bad.  He hooks up with a kid porno ring.  And he's making movies.  I think it was 1979.  Sooner or later.  Here it is.  1979, right.  The video cover and everything.  Maury Amsterdam was in it.  Who was the chick?  Let's see.  Rick Smith.  Michael Skye was his name in that.  Michael Skye.  Michael Skye.  Members of the Skye Band.  A lot of, Dennis Miller was in that? 
[01:35:30]  Come on.  Dennis Miller.  Jesse Walters.  Hmm.  I don't know who the chick was.  Nice.  All right, Danielle's got a good one.  Danielle.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  You watch these after school specials?  Of course I do.  And you guys are forgetting the best one.  Go ahead.  The HBO movie, Calista Farkart, where she's a bulimic.  And then she vomits in jars.  And her mother, like, finds out her little secret when she's putting her clothes away one day. 
[01:36:00]  And opens the closet and she sees these jars of vomit.  And then the mother starts vomiting.  What?  She saved her vomit?  She saved her vomit in jars because her mother was like,  why are you spending so much time in the bathroom?  So she decided to take jars and vomit in her room.  That's a stretch.  Why doesn't she just vomit into the toilet?  I don't know.  Well, because her mother became suspicious when she was in the bathroom so much.  And saw the jars of vomit and started vomiting herself.  It's a popular theme, the bulimic. 
[01:36:30]  Whoa.  747 taking off.  I learned something today.  Bulimia is not cool if you do it into a jar.  No.  Then it's disgusting.  Then you've really got a problem.  That's a problem.  Anorexia or bulimia or drugs, cutting and sex.  There you go.  Always good themes.  You guys are great.  Thanks so much.  I like to cut.  Thanks, Danielle.  Bye-bye.  You ever see the homo one with the football player guy?  And he's in high school. 
[01:37:00]  And he's on the football team.  And he's gay.  He's gay.  And I think Scott Baio was his best friend.  And he finally comes out and tells Scott Baio, and the whole rest of the movie is how Scott Baio is going to deal with his best friend being gay.  And all the other people are like, hey, faggy, faggy.  And Scott Baio has to, like, deal with his friend being gay on the football team.  No, it wasn't a Charles in Charge.  It was a movie.  It was like an after-school thing.  It might have even just been called My Friend's Gay or something.  They really didn't come up with many creative titles. 
[01:37:30]  They had to grab you right in with those after-school specials.  But, you know, something like Susie Pukes.  Would be like, they really got to hit the point.  Bobby's a kid toucher.  I'm watching.  Was he a wide receiver on the football team?  I think he was.  Whack, whack.  Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony!  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Quick one before I tell my confession.  Yeah.  Remember the HBO one with Ben Affleck playing the steroid guy?  Steroid guy. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think I remember that one, too.  The best part of those shows is at the end.  Hi, I'm Ronnie, whatever.  I'm the real guy.  Yeah, yeah.  They would do that.  This almost killed me.  He had to skull it by that time because all his hair fell out.  A skullet would be the mullet that a bald guy wears.  Yeah, the superstar Billy Graham 70s, dude.  All right, quick confession.  Yeah, I got it.  Drove all the way from Brooklyn to, like, exit 63 on the LIE in Long Island.  You know, that's a hike, bro.  That's way out there.  Just for a Hummer. 
[01:38:30]  Just for a Hummer.  Nice.  And it wasn't that good, though.  That's still good.  Well, the chick, she used her teeth, bro.  Well, how'd you meet this girl?  Um, it was a friend of a friend.  The rape.  Ah, screw it.  It was my ex-girlfriend's mother.  Oh.  All right, Tony.  Later, fellas.  Bye.  Here it is.  The truth about Alex was the one about the gay guy.  It was Alex.  I don't believe people actually come up with the names of these things.  The best little girl in the world with Jennifer Jason Leigh is the best anorexia teen film. 
[01:39:00]  You're going to have to rent that one.  The best little girl in the world.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, is she naked in this movie, too?  I'm sure.  I don't think the girl's made a movie where she doesn't show her saggies.  She's got the worst, too.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Did you guys ever see the one Welcome Home Jelly Bean?  I remember the title.  A little retarded girl.  I remember the title.  Welcome Home Jelly Bean.  And the little girl was like, Welcome Home Jelly Bean!  Yeah, we forgot the retard theme, too. 
[01:39:30]  That's always a good after-school special theme.  Like Normal People was the Sean Cassidy one.  Where he's, Raja, Raja, we're in love.  Thank you, my man.  I figured I had to get a kick out of that one.  Cool, Keith.  Thank you.  You remember that one?  You don't remember this one, do you?  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You ever see the after-school special? 
[01:40:00]  It's about this drunk Boston mother.  It's called Three Rights, Make a Left.  It was pretty good.  Wasn't that also titled, I Want to Go Home?  In the parentheses?  Exactly, exactly.  Three Rights, Make a Left.  I Want to Go Home.  Something about boxed wine or something, too, was in that one.  Yes, a simple box of wine.  You're good, Mike.  Take care, guys.  All right.  I also had to, you know something? 
[01:40:30]  Why does he have to do that?  I just remembered being up in Boston for Christmas.  I used to have to go up.  And for some reason, I was always in charge of taking the goddamn lights off the tree.  I'd have to take the lights off the tree and wind them up.  And the way she had them, one year, she tied them in knots around the branches.  And I don't want to, I don't even want to be in there.  And she's like, could you take the lights off the tree?  Hey, first, get me a wine.  Here we go.  Here we go.  And then take the lights off the tree and wind them up nice. 
[01:41:00]  And then, could you please put the storm windows in the screen doors?  It's December already.  Right.  And she couldn't find anyone else to do this until I came up from my vacation.  Go downstairs beside the furnace are the storm windows and put them in.  I'm like, what could this take?  The whole frame had to come out.  Like, I'm using my Makita.  I'm using tools that were in my truck that I needed for construction.  But I'm on vacation. 
[01:41:30]  Could you just put the storm windows in?  And, you know, it's awful cold downstairs in the TV room.  I could use another piece of ductwork to take some heat.  I'm on vacation, lady.  Maybe if you didn't booze it up, you wouldn't be cold.  Try some blood.  The alcohol stream.  Wow.  And I swear, dude, I'm on a ladder on my Christmas vacation installing ductwork in our basement.  What's wrong with that, Anthony? 
[01:42:00]  Well, when you're done, put in the garage door opener.  First drive to see us because if we drive, it's going to take forever.  Because three rides make a left.  I want to go home.  Could you please?  In a touching story of a drunken mother-in-law and a son-in-law in hell, it's three rides make a left.  I want to go home on HBO. 
[01:42:30]  Hi.  What you watched was a dramatization of my life.  I'm the real Judy.  I want to go home.  You know, today I shared a lot about boxed wine and putting my son-in-law through hell.  And you take my breath away.  But this is also educational.  So for all you abused son-in-laws out there, run for your goddamn life. 
[01:43:00]  Whatever it costs.  I want to go home.  Did I ever tell you about the time I pulled up to my apartment?  I was hammered.  And you know the stairs that go up to my apartment on the right side of the building?  I accidentally took the stairs on the left side of the building.  There was a big party going on for the teenage girl that lived next door.  So there's all teens partying and having a kegger.  I walked up the stairs and passed out on the couch. 
[01:43:30]  Much to the dismay of the teens that were partying in this apartment.  She had to call her father and say, who's the drunk brat on the couch?  You've got to be lying.  Swear to God.  I passed out on the neighbor's couch.  Imagine you're partying with your friends.  And this old woman comes up, hammered, and falls asleep on the couch.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  You've watched the dramatization called Three Rides, Make a Left, I Want to Go Home.  Hi, I'm the real Judy.  Stay tuned for next week's After School Special, the longest divorce ever.  Hi, I'm the real Anthony.  I was the son-in-law. 
[01:44:30]  Anthony, could you just build a car house?  Because I want you to.  And there'll be a week of annoying silence if you don't.  It's January 1st, and I want to go to Faneuil Hall.  Yeah, I know the wind whips through it like the Arctic.  But I want to go.  And then when we get there, after a few grommeliers, I'm going to say, I want to go home. 
[01:45:00]  And you know what?  You'll pack me up and take me home.  And else your wife will yell at you.  I want to go home.  And you're off the school special.  On ABC.  Oh, I'm home?  Part two of I'm Home, I Want to Go Out.  Let's go to Tony on the phone. 
[01:45:30]  Tony.  Hey, do you remember that After School Special where the guy always peed his bed and the mom  left the sheets out?  Oh, that was the Michael Landon story.  Very good.  The Michael Landon story.  He was a track star and he peed himself.  That's a true story.  That's what happened to Michael Landon when he was growing up.  He was a track star.  He peed his bed and his mom used to hang the urine stained sheets out the window for the  whole neighborhood to see.  Bedwetter.  Bedwetter.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Dave. 
[01:46:00]  I guess we got to take a little breaks.  Breaks?  Yeah.  A breaks.  I put on the breaks.  A break snowboard.  A break.  Hey, what's up, America?  This is Tracy Morgan and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Don't get it twisted.  Well, I got something to play for you.  All right.  Because you guys do have this obsession with Mike Brady.  Oh, it's an obsession.  I'm pretty obsessed with him, maybe. 
[01:46:30]  Sure.  Here's him describing the first time he ever kissed a girl.  Really?  To one of the kids.  Yeah.  On the Brady Munch.  Hi, sweetheart.  You like my dress?  Mom, can I talk to Dad for a minute?  It's kind of a father something.  Oh.  Well, since I don't really know where to start.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Long pause.  Well, uh...  For Christ's sake, say something.  You hate me, Bobby.  Bobby?  It's a father something, Dad.  Stop.  Come on, Bobby.  Come up to the bathtub with me.  Let me smell your breath.  Long pause.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age? 
[01:47:30]  Ah!  Yeah, I kind of remember that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I throw up.  Her father walked into the room.  I found him much more attractive.  So he's stuck in my keister, and look at me now.  I'm losing weight rapidly.  It's the story of a man named Brady, 
[01:48:00]  and he's wearing pants that get looser by the day...  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Yeah, I kind of remember that I did.  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  I mean, how'd you feel?  Like, did you see skyrockets or something? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, skyrockets came later.  Right up my ass.  Well, not skyrockets exactly.  A few little firecrackers, maybe.  Well, if you did see skyrockets, would that mean you're in love?  I mean, that depends.  I suppose it could.  People who are in love get engaged, right?  It will.  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case...  In some states.  It will. 
[01:49:00]  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case I'd recommend a long engagement.  How long?  About ten years.  Some love and marriage and engagements, it's a wonderful business, but you want to make  very sure about those skyrockets.  Make sure, huh?  Thanks, Dan.  I'll keep in touch.  And by the way...  You do that.  Those weren't firecrackers.  They were T-cells exploding.  A little something for you guys and your obsession with Mike Brady. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Because of the Mike Brady thing.  We can't stop talking about him.  This is hilarious.  Oh.  With his little robe and slippers.  Last days, walking around the hospital.  65 pounds.  Why couldn't I have liked girls?  Hi, this is Dominic Kenese.  You're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton, on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:50:00]  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Opie.  Jimmy is sleeping on the couch.  The lesbian couch, getting ready for another fine Opie and Anthony program.  But why is he sleeping on the couch if we're not even here today?  Stayed.  You stayed all weekend?  Yeah.  All right.  How are you feeling?  I'm very tired, but while you guys are gallivanting, I'm kind of looking after the forge.  We're getting ready for another fine Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  We've got to intro a few bits here, and then we're going to get some more bits on the air  that we have to intro because we're not here today.  Right.  I'm in Florida celebrating my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  I noticed a date on the paper here.  It's my birthday.  How about that?  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Angel.  Thank you, Anthony.  Remember when Tracy Morgan was in studio?  Of course.  He gave us some hilarious radio.  Hilarious.  And that's all I have to say about this.  I don't remember anything else about it.  So why don't we just play Tracy Morgan in studio? 
[01:51:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're doing a baseball game.  Tracy.  What's up, Tracy?  Tracy Morgan in studio.  His first visit on the brand new show.  He's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday.  212-757-4100 for ticket information.  But, I mean, you've blown up so big.  We don't even have to sell these shows, right?  When?  Wow.  You've blown up, bro.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know, I'm still out there getting them pregnant and stuff. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah?  Yes.  You don't wear bags?  Nah.  Never.  Hey, where's Kim?  Let me, let me, can I smell Kim?  Thank you.  Sniffing Jimmy's fingers?  Yes.  That's great.  I think she said her name was Kim.  She had a wig and a Colby jersey.  I hope it was a she.  It's good to be back here with you guys, man.  I miss you.  Been a while.  Word up.  Definitely.  Last time we saw each other, we went through, what, 30 cases at the baseball game? 
[01:52:00]  I was pitching.  Yeah, we first met Tracy.  Jim Brewer introduced us to Tracy.  Brewer was talking about Tracy Morgan for years, and we finally got to meet Tracy at our celebrity  softball game.  And Brewer just brought him along.  He wasn't really doing our show at that point or anything.  And Tracy just freaking stole the show.  I had a great time, man.  At one point, I was in, like, the pool naked with, like, two chicks, man.  You got to understand, we do these celebrity softball games from time to time, and there  were 6,000 people at the last one.  No exaggeration.  It was sold out at a minor league stadium. 
[01:52:30]  And Tracy decided he needed a pitch, so he walks out of the dugout in just his tighty-whities,  man, his underwear.  It was a jock, right?  With your pair of shoes.  It was a jock strap.  It was just a jock strap.  Yeah, that was all he was wearing.  Jock strap and cleats.  And cleats.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books now.  I mean, they open up the Opie Anthony show.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books.  You don't know Fugazi here.  Dude, those pictures have circulated around the internet for years.  Yeah.  For years.  They pop up every once in a while when I'm doing searches.  Yeah.  You pitching in a jock strap in front of 6,000 people.  With a gut. 
[01:53:00]  With a gut.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You're a lot thinner.  A speed bump.  You got that Hollywood thinness to you now.  What happened?  You trimmed down a whole lot.  I went out there and I got on some no-carb stuff.  You know, I'm a carnivore.  I'm a New York guy, man.  Yeah.  I love my carbs, man.  And, you know, it's just crazy out there, man.  But I'm having a good time.  I'm partying.  Yeah, you're on Hollywood slim now.  Nah, you know what I mean?  I still drink my beer and all that.  My brewage, yeah.  Got it.  I just got into a shoving match at the club the other night.  Get out.  With who?  Yeah, with my cousin. 
[01:53:30]  Really?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I don't drink Cristal.  No?  My brewage, yeah.  I drink brewage.  Why is my bill 1,600 bucks?  And why is it coming to me, dude?  So, two of my chains.  I had, like, two platinum chains and they got ripped off my neck.  And everything.  So, wait.  Your cousin is drinking the Cristal?  No.  He was drinking brew, too.  He just ordered it as a gag.  Are you kidding me?  He ordered it as a gag.  He said, you're rich. 
[01:54:00]  You got a TV show.  I said, no, the show got canceled, dude.  Can't order stuff like that now, man.  And they come up to you with a bill and you're getting a shoving match with your cousin.  Yeah, man.  Did you kick his ass?  Nah, no punches were thrown.  We just grabbed each other's shirts.  A few buttons popped off.  That was it.  I broke a nail, though.  I'm Hollywood now.  You got to watch out.  I don't eat carbs.  I'm Hollywood.  I'm La Brea.  You know, getting back to the celebrity softball game.  The best part of the celebrity softball game was afterwards. 
[01:54:30]  We were in the locker room.  That's where Michael Jackson touched me, but y'all didn't know that.  That's where Michael Jackson touched me.  And you were hammered, man.  And you had to have half a case of beer easily.  Oh, yeah.  For dolo.  And a little of this, you know.  Yeah, for dolo.  That's marijuana, not Coke.  Then you were trying to rally the troops to get a trip going to Harlem.  Yeah.  You wanted to, like, get all the white boys together.  And let's go up to Harlem.  Yeah, a little field trip to Harlem. 
[01:55:00]  I had a couple of strippers that I wanted to introduce you guys to.  That's right.  Yeah.  Young, fresh, and green.  I've never laughed harder in my life.  No exaggeration.  You are so on talking about how white we really were and that we needed a field trip to Harlem.  Little soul, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Get you guys some afros and stuff like that.  We would have been great.  You know, shake a few people down.  We would have been great.  Harlem ain't like the old days, though, now.  Good cop, bad cop.  You know what it is.  They're kind of, I don't know, they're reworking Harlem. 
[01:55:30]  They're fixing everything up.  Yeah, well, what happened was a Starbucks appeared.  Yeah.  That's what I knew was going down here.  That's the beginning, right?  Yeah, a Genovese and a Starbucks came to the ghetto.  Genovese and a Starbucks, that's when it's going commercial.  And then who bought the Apollo and fixed that all up?  Wasn't it, like, white people?  Mm-hmm.  Like, some white people bought.  Some white people bought the Apollo.  You know that.  We didn't have the money.  We didn't have the bread.  No.  I think this white dude bought one of Whitney Houston's Grammys.  I went to, I went next door. 
[01:56:00]  It was Whitney Houston's neighbor.  I went to his crib.  Really?  And I seen a Grammy sitting on the coffee table.  I said, sir, how did you get that?  He said, don't you worry about it.  And then I looked on the wall.  He had my prerogative platinum album on his wall.  I said, how'd you get that?  He said, don't worry about it.  Yeah, they knew that.  I said, there's a garage sale out over there.  You know Whitney Houston lost a tooth?  Yeah?  Really?  She lost a tooth, man.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  How do you think she lost a tooth?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:56:30]  I hope Bobby ain't smoking.  I don't know.  It's either Bobby knocked it out or she chipped it with a crack pipe.  I don't know.  Man, she just looks like a crackhead these days.  Yeah, you got to leave that Coke alone, man.  It's 99 and 0.  You can't win.  Nah.  Yeah, you can't win.  She sweats like a pig.  You see Bridget Nielsen?  Yeah.  Oh, she used to be a hot chick.  She used to be a hot chick.  Probably, man.  That just might be time, though.  I still get a pregnant, though.  I still beat that.  Nah.  I'll get a pregnant and a heartbeat. 
[01:57:00]  What?  That's Bridget Nielsen.  She dating Foofy Foofy.  That's over, though, because she ended up marrying the Italian dude.  She did.  Oh, yeah.  The Italian midget, they call him.  So, you don't wear bags at all.  I don't like wearing bags.  Do you like when they tell you that you don't have to pull out?  Like, I like that when they tell me that I don't have a pill and you don't have to pull out.  There's something really sexy about that.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Because we old school, man.  We are old school.  I can't take the time out to rip a package and all.  Come on, man. 
[01:57:30]  I'm 36 years old.  My concentration's got to be right there.  Yeah, but you don't want a bunch of...  It's like when you masturbate, everything's got to be quiet.  The pillows don't touch my arm.  I don't want the pillows touching my arm.  I get everything straight.  I've got to set everything up.  I've got to do, like, six push-ups.  You know what I'm saying?  Just get everything straight.  Fix the track, getting the contrast on the TV.  No music playing in the background.  No music.  Nothing.  Everything's got to be silent.  You ever notice when you masturbate, everything sound like a car door slamming?  What, outside distractions?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's awful.  I can't do with that. 
[01:58:00]  I can't do...  It's like when you have sex with your woman after you've been with her for, like, ten years.  You know, you've got to concentrate.  You've got to focus on that dead roach in the corner.  You've got to focus on that ball of dirty socks.  Oh, my God.  I've got to focus on that bad.  You know what the aroma is when grown people have sex?  When you ever walk by a room after, like, two grown people have sex, it smells like coffee.  It smells like potato chips and pretzels. 
[01:58:30]  It smells like butt, testicles, Bacardi and Coke, Marlboro Lights, and Doublemint.  That's the smell of love.  Dirty socks and tears.  But that's...  You ever...  Like, my son is 19, right?  Yeah.  And all he does is masturbate at this point.  You know, I've got to get him something because he's going to go pop.  He might kill me and his mother.  You know, and say that the devil made him do it or something.  I've got to get him laid.  I've got to get this dude laid. 
[01:59:00]  But you know what his room smells like, right?  Bust off in socks.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, he's 19.  I caught him.  He was humping my leg the other day, man.  Trying to beat him with a newspaper.  Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?  I don't know.  The dude is into his academics.  Really?  He's into academics.  That kind of gets in the way sometimes, you know?  Yeah, he's into academics.  I say, oh, man.  That gets in the way.  You don't know, brother.  Gotta get off that stuff.  When I was 19, by the time I was 19, I had an empire ready.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had several kids. 
[01:59:30]  Several kids.  Of which I've never claimed.  How many kids do you think you got?  I'm good between 12 and about 35.  I told you, I don't use bags, man.  Never.  We don't pull out.  I think that's a real woman when she say, no, you don't got to.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  Well, maybe she's just looking for the Tracy Morgan money.  Well, you know, whenever I need, you know, income taxes and stuff like that.  Oh, some deductions?  You know me, man.  I'm like Jim Brown, baby.  I'm in the Hall of Fame.  As a matter of fact, I'm doing a celebrity golf tournament while I'm in town, yes. 
[02:00:00]  It's a benefit for women with C-section scars, man.  I'm trying to raise some money for C-section scars and stretch marks.  That's my thing.  Are you a golfer, Tracy?  No, but we just put together.  And the key, one of the key notes will be Al Sharpton.  Benoit Benjamin will be speaking.  Sharpton is a golfer?  Benoit Benjamin.  Who's that?  Benoit Benjamin testified against Jason Williams for the Nets, right?  Benoit was sleeping on his couch and he testified. 
[02:00:30]  See, if I was Jason Williams, I would have said yes.  I would have just implicated the Harlem Globetrotters.  I would have kept putting the word cocaine and Globetrotters together.  Because they're beloved.  And I know a lot of people in that jury, in the jury box, love them.  So I would have just said yes.  Yes.  I admit.  I was doing cocaine with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Yes.  Yes, me and the G-Trotters was doing coke.  Yes.  I didn't mean to shoot nobody, but yes.  Metal lock, let me, bought four eight bars.  Yes. 
[02:01:00]  Yes, Curly McNeil.  Yes.  I was sniffing with Curly.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Do some tricks.  Yeah.  Distract the jury a little bit.  Sure.  There's someone on the phone that has a Tracy Morgan story.  Uh-oh.  Let's go here for a second.  Colin in Connecticut.  Colin.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Well, we have Tracy Morgan in studio.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend here in New York City.  Well, I was an intern at Saturday Night Live five years ago, and, Trey, I don't know  if you remember me.  My name's Colin Cosell.  Oh! 
[02:01:30]  What's up, Colin?  That's Howard Cosell's grandson.  I've actually met him, too, I think.  Yeah.  That's my dude.  That's my dude.  Wait.  Howard Cosell was your grandfather?  Yeah.  Jimmy and I did stand-up.  Stand-up in New York together.  Yeah.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  What's up, bro, bro?  How you been, man?  I cannot complain, my man, but I've got the best Tracy Morgan story ever.  Sure.  They brought in a new intern one day, and this kid was completely starstruck, and Trey's  just like, yo, Colin, go and grab this kid, bring him down the hall, and tell him Trey 
[02:02:00]  Morgan's got something to tell him.  And I was like, all right.  So I grabbed this kid, and I think his name was Winston.  I said, Winston, Tracy Morgan wants to see you.  He goes, really?  And his jaw drops, and his eyes are big, and he cannot wait.  And bring him into Tracy Morgan's dressing room, because Trey used to let me go and smoke  cigarettes in there.  Thank you very much, Trey.  Right on, baby.  And sits him down, and he's got a chair right there, and he pops in this orange videocassette.  Now, he's got an orange videocassette.  It's either a Disney film or a nasty-ass porn. 
[02:02:30]  And he pops it in, and lo and behold, there's this black dude with this 18-inch bone, and  this white girl dressed as a cheerleader blowing him.  And this kid's fucking eyes blew out of his head.  Blew out of his head.  That's right.  Remember that scene?  Oh, dude.  That was-  Just to loosen him up, right?  That'll loosen.  Real people do real things.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Go outside to smoke a blood, and people will ask for his phone number, and he'll say,  Colin, take this and walk the other way.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:03:00]  I gave the guy the tape, too.  Oh, man.  What a guy.  That kid was crazy, man.  We had a good time, though.  Yeah, we did.  But the fact that this is Howard Cosell's grandson.  I know.  I totally-  That was my dude, man.  Yo, we used to go to lunch together, man.  He used to tell me stories about his grandfather, you know?  Yeah.  How old were you when he passed away?  That was April 23rd, 95.  I was 15.  So 15.  So you had some time with him.  I mean, you remember him.  I had a lot of time with him.  No, he was around constantly.  Who has the toupee? 
[02:03:30]  I've heard rumors that someone has the toupee.  That's impossible.  I used to put the tape in for when my grandmother passed away.  I used to put the tape in that thing for him.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, we were very, very close.  Hey, did you ever meet Ali?  Oh, of course.  Oh, man.  You want to hear a great story?  I was six years old, and that was the first time I met Ali.  Six years old, and I wake up to this big black man shaking me and saying,  Come on, little man.  Your grandfather wants to come have lunch with us.  And I wake up.  There's this gigantic black man shaking me. 
[02:04:00]  And I'm like, What in the fuck is going on?  That's all you know at the time.  He walks me out, and I'm shaking.  I'm like, Hi, Papa.  Who's this?  You met Muhammad, I see.  I'm like, Yes, I did.  He said, Muhammad is a good friend of mine and the greatest of all time.  I was like, Okay.  This means nothing to me.  That is a great impression, dude.  Wow.  Well, I grew up with him, man.  I used to listen to him screaming at the television. 
[02:04:30]  We got him into hockey, and used to yell, John Van Beesbrook.  We taught him that his nickname was Beezer.  So we'd sit there going, Beezer.  Beezer.  I can't wait for halftime.  I need to take a tinny.  And they're like, What?  What the fuck?  Isn't that funny?  This guy's just like, That's his grandfather.  Everyone has their kooky grandfather stories, but this is how it goes south.  He has an impression and all.  Hey, dude, they should put you on Saturday Night Live, man.  I wish they would.  I'd use the work, goddammit. 
[02:05:00]  Right on.  Well, we've got to get you in here.  I would love to go in there, man.  All right.  Hell yeah.  Well, hold on the line.  We're going to get your contact info and have you in.  Oh, Jimmy's shaking his head no?  What?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't want you in here.  Jimmy's like, No, that's not him.  I actually liked him.  We met in New York.  He was a nice dude, man.  I liked him a lot.  And actually, my friends were so excited to meet Jimmy that Jimmy was just moving to  his new apartment, and I introduced my friends to him because they were big fans of Jimmy  Norton.  Who isn't?  I mean, how can you not be? 
[02:05:30]  He's gorgeous.  And they ended up having a conversation about how to hang a mirror on sheetrock.  That's right, Jimmy.  I really did.  I bought an apartment.  They should have just lined cocks up that I could lick on the way into my door.  I bought candles and little rocks and a mirror.  Bed, bath, and beyond, Jimmy.  Bed, bath, and beyond, right?  All right.  So off air, they're going to take your information and stuff.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, we'd love to have you in, Colin.  I would love to come in, guys.  I'd love to.  All right, cool.  There he goes, Colin from Connecticut. 
[02:06:00]  Colin, be good.  That's pretty cool.  Cedric from Tennessee wants in.  Cedric.  What's happening?  What's up?  Hey, man, I just want to know if Tracy got any steaks for sale, man.  I'm having a barbecue this weekend.  You're talking about the meat man character I'm playing.  Hell yeah, man.  You know me, man.  But I'll be at the barbecue, baby.  Yes, word, man.  Hey, I'm going to invite your little brother Spoonie Love in, too, man.  You got it, man.  Let me tell you something about Spoonie, man.  You know, Caligula invented the orgy, right? 
[02:06:30]  But Spoonie invented the pop-off.  You know, the jump-off.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes, sir.  How about your boy?  Have a good barbecue, man.  Hey, word.  All right.  You're speaking some kind of code language.  I understood that.  We don't quite understand.  White people, white people.  We just heard nothing, nothing, nothing.  Caligula.  Okay.  It's good black stuff.  Hey, how long have you been off SNL?  You've been there for a long time, man.  Yeah, I was there for seven years, but I've been off for about two now. 
[02:07:00]  Off for two?  Do you listen or do you want to go back now?  Nah, man.  I'm good.  I'm moving forward.  I'm out of daddy's home.  The last two or three years, you just blew up.  Like, for a while.  My show got canceled, man.  I went out to L.A.  No, but I mean the last couple years of Saturday Night Live, you just blew up.  Yeah, I mean.  I'm like, all that talent was just sitting there for all those years, and then finally they used you.  Yeah, it took them about four years.  It was unbelievable.  It was like steaming Willie Beamer for many given Sunday.  Where was Brian Kello?  Where was Brian Kello?  You had some unbelievable characters the last couple of years there. 
[02:07:30]  And I'm thinking at home, all this was in them, and they're not using them.  Yeah, they didn't use them for many years.  I don't think Lauren, and I'm sure you love Lauren, but I personally don't think he uses black talent very well, to be honest with you.  And I've heard that complaint from other performers, and he's like, I mean, Murphy blew up when, you know, I think Ebersole was there.  Yeah, Ebersole was there.  But, you know, I never looked at it like a color thing.  Excuse me.  I never looked at it like a color thing.  I just take time for people to know your voice and the writers to get to know your voice.  And I'm from a different world anyway, so, you know, I just leaned back for the first couple of years. 
[02:08:00]  I played my cards right, let them cast me and stuff, you know what I'm saying?  Let them put the lipstick on me and the dresses on me and all of that.  Cut my balls off, you know, and all of that stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  But then after a while, then all the heavy hitters started breaking out, so I just said, you know, I stepped up.  I stepped right in there.  Yeah.  And I'm glad it happened like that because, you know, then I got my own TV show, which got canceled after 22 episodes.  What happened?  You did 22, though. 
[02:08:30]  I don't know.  You would have to ask NBC.  I got 22, but, you know, when I went out to L.A., my vagina was nice and pretty.  Now I look like a orangutan back there.  You know, the big pig orangutan cootie cat?  I got the big baboon cootie cat now.  Red and sore.  I mean, you know, it was nice and pretty when I got out there, you know.  I saw you on Sharon Osbourne's show cooking, what were you cooking, like little beans and franks?  It was really funny, man.  Pork and beans and franks from Grape Kool-Aid.  It was really funny. 
[02:09:00]  That's a ghetto delicacy, man.  That's a ghetto delicacy.  Kool-Aid.  It's called Franks and Bean Casserole with Grape Kool-Aid.  Grape Kool-Aid, of course.  With a little slice of lemon in it.  And I got to cook a sweet potato pie because when you get these TV shows, you do a lot of press.  Yeah.  I mean, you amp up.  I mean, NBC pulled out all the stops.  You know, I was the next Cosby show and all of that stuff.  So I got to cook a sweet potato pie with Bo Jackson and everything.  Really?  You know I'm on the anti-doping committee for comedians. 
[02:09:30]  I didn't know that.  So if you're smoking marijuana before you set, I'm going to see you out there.  You're going to be tested in these clubs.  You know who's going to be the surprise witness in this Michael Jackson case, right?  It's going to be Bubbles.  I know.  They're very distracting, aren't they?  What are you guys doing?  The Chimp.  Just leave all that shit alone right now.  The Chimp going to pull the zipper down.  It's going to be Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  It's going to be Jim Brewer in the Chimp suit. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, he's a sucker.  You're going to see Michael Jackson.  They're going to bring, they're going, the bailiff is going to walk Bubbles down the aisle.  And Bubbles is going to glimpse that Mike.  Mike going to turn the defense table over and say, you banana-eating chimpanzee witness protection program.  You be eating bananas in Alaska.  I'm done with you.  What do you think, Mike?  And Bubbles is going to say, no, no.  I've seen it all, your honor.  I've seen it all.  Yes, he touched one of them boys over there by the teacups.  Did you, when you, when you show one of them little boys by the giraffe enclosement. 
[02:10:30]  You went for a year on the show.  Do you, did it, did it not, I actually didn't see it.  It's great.  Did they, did they write stuff that you didn't like?  Or were you happy with the final product and it just didn't get ratings?  I didn't see it.  Of course.  I was a black dude.  But what I'm going to say.  What, they wrote stuff that you thought was like this?  I'm quite sure the slaves didn't want to pick cotton either.  The slaves didn't make 30 grand a week.  I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you the slaves were smoking weed.  They used to stop in the middle of picking and go, you see all this cotton we got to pick? 
[02:11:00]  Get high, man.  You can't pick all this cotton sober.  It smells good.  You're liking that Egg McMuffin there, huh?  No, no, no, no.  A sausage?  So much for no carbs.  It smells really good though.  Want a bite?  No, thanks, man.  Wait, someone is saying that you had the funniest line ever on SNL.  What?  Scott in Chicago.  If it's about Brittany?  Hey.  Hey.  I think Tracy delivered the funniest line in the history of Saturday Night Live.  I love you.  God bless your soul.  When you did Astronaut Jones and she was the alien asking for help to save her planet. 
[02:11:30]  I said, why don't you turn around and show me that big fat ass?  Big fat ass.  Remember the whole sketch?  I was like, yeah, right.  I did not stop.  What was that like?  Was she pissed about that?  Who?  Nah, they loved it, baby.  They loved it.  Didn't you improv that?  That wasn't the original line.  You added to that line.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did a lot.  I used to do that all the time.  And Brittany didn't have a problem with that?  Nah, I tongue kissed Brittany about six, seven times.  Oh, wow.  That whole week.  Because I was doing, but that wasn't that.  When I used to do Woodrow, which was the guy that lived in the sewer, he got the girls, 
[02:12:00]  but I got to kiss him.  I kissed Lucy Liu.  And I would, like, try to put my tongue in they mouth.  Like, at the time she was dating Justin, he was standing right there, and I dared him  to say something.  You know the reason why Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston broke up, right?  Me.  Yep.  Stop calling the house, Brad.  Leave it alone, okay?  It's over.  Stop calling the house.  She's pregnant by me.  Leave it alone.  Just leave it alone.  Walk away, Brad. 
[02:12:30]  Would you smell her ass, Jennifer Aniston?  Come on, man.  Jennifer Aniston can fart in my mouth.  I'm a freak, baby.  I'm a freak.  He's old school filthy.  I love Tracy.  I'm a weedy, weedy, bing-bong freak.  Come over here, fart in my mouth.  That's great.  Get over here.  Hud J-Lo at the same time.  Poop right in my mouth.  I'm a weedy, bing-bong freak.  What do you think about Britney being pregnant there, Tracy?  That's my child.  Really?  That's my child's going to come out.  Everything's going to come out. 
[02:13:00]  All the facts are going to come out.  That's going to be a surprise.  That body's getting ruined, though.  Nah, that's the way I like it.  Yeah?  Stretch marks and all that.  It's the mark of womanhood.  I like cellulite.  Any woman that go against cellulite is going against womanhood.  That's all the part.  Hey, that got to be jelly, because jam don't shake like that.  You like a woman after she's had a kid or two?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't like nothing new.  No?  But my money.  I want a woman that bent through the fire.  Through the fire.  Really? 
[02:13:30]  Through the limit.  Yeah.  Through the love.  You don't like them all nice and tight?  Hey, listen.  I'm not a scorer.  I'm a rebounder.  You're coming out of bad relations.  Come see me.  I'm Matt Cavilions.  Come see me.  Hey, I take kids.  I accept kids.  All of that.  Force the kids.  Come see me.  If you're getting social security checks with them kids, give me half.  I'll take care of your life.  Wow.  You don't see many guys like that. 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  I'm a rebounder.  I'll dive over the scoring table for a rebound.  Happy lessons.  I'm with it.  We should play.  And it's a bonus if you got crust on the back of your feet.  Oh, God.  With that little black welfare toenail at the end.  That is really nasty, man.  See the women wearing the sandals or something in the store?  They're shuffling along, and there's just that big calloused, crusty thing on the back  of their heel.  You like that?  That's sexy.  It's like yellowish, white.  You know, you ain't made love until you had a woman that's in a vegetating state or 
[02:14:30]  something.  I don't like resistance, man.  I like to get straight to the point.  Like a Terry Schiavo kind of?  When you're fucking the alarm, you just flop over the side of the bed and double.  That's what I'm like to be dangling over your shoulders and stuff.  I had this one chick that, you know, one crippled chick.  That was my thing.  Really?  Hey, man.  It's a sexy thing when you sneak up into ICU.  Sneak up.  Yeah.  And have sex with a woman with IVs hanging out of her arms. 
[02:15:00]  That's sexy.  Yeah.  You know what they say?  Sometimes white guys like to drive around and find black prostitutes and break their arm.  Really?  Sadistic white dudes from the suburbs.  Break their arm?  Break their arm.  Why?  When they get having almost sex, they just break their arm.  Some guys, some white guys get off on that.  I never heard that.  I've never heard that in my life.  It's tragic.  You've never seen a prostitute with a cast on?  I've seen some prostitutes with their cast.  Yeah, John broke her arm.  That's because of white guys?  That's a John broke her arm.  I always assumed it was the pimp or something. 
[02:15:30]  No, the pimp don't care.  He sent her to the hospital to get their cast on.  Then all the other chicks on the strip sign her cast.  You ever seen a baby with a cast on?  That's dark, right?  I love dark music.  That's pretty sad.  Dark.  You're always assuming it was something bad.  I was the one that told Luke Skywalker, F. Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Really?  We're going to hang out with the Emperor and Darth Vader.  That's where the party's at.  We're going to the Death Star.  I booed Star Wars. 
[02:16:00]  Why?  Because of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Yeah?  Damn, man.  The Force be with you.  Come on, man.  Emperor, Darth Vader.  You seen that suit?  You seen Obi-Wan Kenobi's suit?  Did you see Darth Vader's suit?  Darth Vader got fashion sense.  Puppy redid that.  Sean John made that Darth Vader's suit.  You know Papa Smurf was a bad drinker?  Wow.  He has two domestic violence charges for putting his hands on Smurfette.  He drove a Cutler Sierra. 
[02:16:30]  You can change directions.  He's all over the road today.  He knocked down two or three mushrooms over in Smurfville trying to park that car one night.  Don't we got to play for Tracy?  Do you know Batman and Robin really didn't get along?  Um-be-know-ins.  Um-be-know-ins.  Because Robin smoked Marlboro lights and he burnt the hole in the bat seat in the passenger side.  And Batman begged him.  First of all, there was a lot of resentment there because Robin didn't ever have a belt.  No, he didn't have a utility belt. 
[02:17:00]  He hated Commissioner Gordon.  He thought Commissioner Gordon was a jerk.  This is what Robin, he said he's a jerk.  Yeah.  He keeps putting the bat signal in the air.  How do you think they're joking him?  No, we coming.  Why don't you just use the phone?  That's why Verizon installed him.  He had a big cock, by the way, Robin.  Yeah.  Legendarily big cock.  He had to wear two little things to keep it from bulging out.  Oh, really?  Come on.  It's like Janet Jackson.  You know, one titty popping out?  Come on.  That's comedy.  If both would have popped out, we would have been like, oh, that's sexy. 
[02:17:30]  But one is like, boom.  Oh, a blue titty popped out.  That was for me.  I mean, America went crazy.  But that was just like two black chicks having to fight.  You know, whoever titty popped out, that's the winner.  She went for her.  She went for her.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bobby, Hagi, Bobby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is fuck my shit,  because they ain't give me no money.  V.O.B. and Anthony, yo. 
[02:18:00]  XM Radio, Cash Up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  XM 202, The O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're going to squeeze in one more bit here, Anthony.  Dee Dee.  We love Dee Dee.  Dee Dee, who thought the first time we had Dee Dee on the show  that she was such a farrake?  Did you know?  Didn't she come across as a very wholesome, very withdrawn kind of girl?  She's very shy.  We were wrong.  She's got stories that rival sailors. 
[02:18:30]  She talks about this time she was so fucked up.  No, no, that's the beauty of what they wrote on this one, too.  Dee Dee, crazy stories.  The boys dig deeper with Dee Dee and find out that the used to be a big druggie  who once got so fucked she woke up in Vegas, married, and didn't even remember.  How do you get so fucked that you go that far west?  Was the guy just jamming at home, and they were moving across America like six inches  at a time to the point she got so fucked that she ended up in Vegas? 
[02:19:00]  He fucked her all the way to Vegas?  That's what I'm saying.  Is that what they're saying here?  Well, that's what it says.  The boys dig deeper with Dee Dee and find out, I'll fix the typo here, Anthony, find out  that she used to be a big druggie who once got so fucked she woke up in Vegas, married,  and didn't even remember.  That's fucked.  That means she was on her back all the way from Washington to Vegas.  To Vegas.  Six inches at a time.  She decided to stay with the guy anyway to see if it would work out.  Right.  Here it is on The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:19:30]  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  In studio, we have Dee Dee.  Hello.  Hey, Dee Dee.  Dee Dee's back.  Now, you were telling some kind of crazy story in the other room, and everyone's like,  you've got to hear the story.  Well, way back when, about 10, no, 11 and a half years ago or so, I was living in L.A.  at the time, and I used to go to Vegas a lot, so I took a trip to Vegas one weekend, woke  up one morning to find out that I was married to a British guy. 
[02:20:00]  It kind of came out of an alcoholic, drug state of mind.  Wow.  I look over, and he's like, so how does it feel to be married?  And I guess the day before, I was at the courthouse, ended up married, had no clue, and my  fucked up mind at the time thought, well, he's cute, he has an accent, he's from England,  this could work.  So we went back to L.A.  He had a lot of money on him, cash in the house, and he was leaving for a ski trip.  He told me to keep the money safe, so he left, and I didn't feel safe with it in the house,  so, you know, take it to the savings account, right? 
[02:20:30]  So I'm at the bank.  The bank teller's like, wait a minute.  Next thing I know, I'm dealing with the Secret Service.  So it was counterfeit money, and then, needless to say, he's back in England.  Wow.  But you know what?  I'm thankful, you know, I'm grateful to the Secret Service, because he's like, you've got  to get your shit together, or else you're going to end up dead.  So I haven't had a mind-altering substance for 11 years.  Oh, good.  Wow.  All right, wait a minute.  There's so much to this story.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm glad you laid it out there, but now we've got to dig in a little bit. 
[02:21:00]  Just a bit.  Just a bit.  But Vegas, all right, you're in Vegas for what?  You're just there?  Just there to hang out.  Now, you weren't with this guy?  No.  So you met the guy in Vegas?  I guess so.  You don't even remember meeting this guy?  Have you ever been in an alcoholic blackout?  Well, you don't recall anything.  It's like a part of your life that never comes to the end.  Steve, put your hand down.  Yeah.  Geez, Steve's all like, yeah, me, I have.  Ben's saying nobody's in one now. 
[02:21:30]  No, so I don't recall.  No, I don't even remember being at the courthouse.  Let me ask you something.  I'm not going to interrupt you, but you could have actually said something like, something,  something, party rocks, and you wouldn't even remember?  I could be having a conversation right now, and I would never remember.  Yeah.  So you were in Vegas.  You're getting a little drunk.  You went there just for the weekend to gamble and stuff?  Among other things.  What kind of drug was your drug of choice back then?  Coke, crystal meth, stuff like that.  Crystal meth?  Yeah.  You know, L.A., California. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Coke doesn't really get you where you don't know what you're doing.  Yeah, but crystal meth was cheaper then, so.  Crystal meth.  Even that, though, kind of gets you alert.  It doesn't, you must have been really drunk.  Yeah, but then like, I was, the alcohol.  What were you drinking?  When I used to drink gin and tonics.  Gin and tonics.  Wow.  Midori.  Would people consider you a lightweight or a heavy drinker?  See, I was a functioning alcoholic.  Yeah.  Where I could go through the week fine, but I black out when I drink, so I'm an alcoholic.  You don't have to explain it. 
[02:22:30]  We know.  So you didn't eat.  We know all about a functioning alcoholic.  So you completely black out where you're walking around, you're talking, you're doing  things.  I'm functioning.  But you have no clue what you're doing.  Exactly.  And you wake up the next day.  I get married and, you know.  So you were packed.  Did the English guy ever tell you how you met, or?  Yeah, at the roulette table at Circus Circus.  So you must have been drunk and playing roulette, and he walked over, and did he fill you in? 
[02:23:00]  It was sometime in the afternoon, like around, I don't know, maybe one, two in the afternoon.  In the afternoon, and you're smashed to the point of not remembering anything.  Right.  It was Las Vegas.  Wow.  Of course.  Dee Dee, party rock.  Party rock.  Wow, so apparently this guy comes over and starts talking to you, and wow, you sound  like in those states of mind, you may have been a bit promiscuous.  I guess so.  I guess so.  He was in my bed, so, and I was married to him. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, now, did you do anything before you got married?  Like, did you have sex with him, as far as you know, and then get married?  Or did you say, I'm not doing this unless I'm married?  I don't know.  I was, like, blacked out.  You're still, to this day, he never filled you in on a timeline?  Didn't you say, hey, hubby, could you tell me how this?  Well, he just said, you know, we met, and we had some fun, and I'm like, let's get married.  I'm like, okay. 
[02:24:00]  So, yeah, you met, had some fun.  Did you really get married, though?  Yes, I'll bring in the, I'll make a copy of the marriage system.  Obviously, it's been annulled, I mean.  Well, obviously, you can't if you did the deed, so no.  Wait, you can't annul it even if you did it in a passed out, drunken stupid?  Well, because in my fucked up mind, this was going to work.  He was my man.  Oh, so instead of getting it annulled, you figured, let's make this work.  Right, I was so fucked up on drugs.  Because it was based on something so pure and honest and loving.  Yeah, he's cute, he has an accent, he's from England, this could work. 
[02:24:30]  That's all you need, really.  Who did he look like, as far as maybe somebody that we know, celebrity-wise, anyone, even close?  Probably looked like Captain Morgan.  No.  Wearing a pirate suit.  I don't know.  God, you know, I'm trying to think, who did he match up with?  So you go back to L.A., how long did you live with him?  A few months.  A few months?  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Wow, she really tried to...  So you were banging this guy, huh?  When you got back to L.A.?  Hello, here's my husband, yeah.  Was he any good?  He's English.  Oh, here's my husband.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He was English, though.  Was he any good in this act?  Well, yeah.  See, I have a thing for accents.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Wow, how about that?  This chick is just amazing.  You're amazing.  You really are.  You're married, and he had a house in L.A.?  I had the place.  You had the place.  He was from England, so he had nothing. 
[02:25:30]  Wait, he had nothing?  He had counterfeit money.  He had counterfeit American test.  That I didn't know.  So you take him back to England.  You didn't ask him where he was staying when he was in the U.S.?  No.  How long was he in the U.S. before...  When you're on drugs, you don't care.  Wait, you don't even know how long your husband for a few months was in...  You never sat down with him and said, hey, how long have you been in America?  No, you don't understand.  I was really...  Where did you live before you married me?  I don't know.  I was so fucked up.  I didn't care at that time.  You don't understand.  That was a different time of my life.  I was really fucked up. 
[02:26:00]  Amazing.  I didn't care about a lot of shit.  I am amazed at this.  So he moves into your place.  She's going to give Jim Norton a run for his money.  I know.  The deeper we delve into this, Jim...  You are a freak.  So you go...  He moves into your house.  Yes.  Were you...  I know you were all fucked up, but were you troubled by anything?  The fact that maybe he didn't work or...  He had money.  He had money.  I didn't know it was counterfeit, but I guess he was involved with things I didn't know.  How much money did he have? 
[02:26:30]  It was a lot.  How much?  How much did you take to the bank with you?  Well, I took like 10 grand in cash.  Uh-huh.  And a savings account?  But he had a lot more than that?  But it would be safer there in the savings account.  That was my mentality back then because I was on drugs.  So all of a sudden he's like, I'm going...  He should have said, you know, I'm going on a ski trip.  Keep this money safe.  By the way, it's counterfeit.  He left that out.  So he went on a ski trip.  Yes.  All right.  And he had a bag of dough there.  Yeah.  Why didn't you go with him?  Because I was working.  Oh. 
[02:27:00]  What were you doing at the time?  I was working on a show called The Mo Show.  Mo Gaffney, she's a comedian actress.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And she had a talk show at the time.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So...  Wow.  So he goes on a ski trip and there's...  How much money was in the house, do you think?  Ten grand.  Oh, it was just ten grand.  Well, what I brought to the maker was about ten grand.  But how much was...  How much total counterfeit money did he have?  Oh, I don't know.  He had a lot.  Was it...  There was something going on.  Hundreds of thousands or a million or...  There was a lot.  How much?  Over a hundred thousand?  I don't know.  There was a lot, though.  He was living... 
[02:27:30]  It's a lot.  Comfortably.  Was he printing it in the States or...  I don't know.  Distributing or printing?  You didn't see anything about it?  The Secret Service never told you how far into it this guy was?  No, he...  The Secret Service dude was like, you know, obviously had no clue that it was counterfeit  because why would you bring it to the bank?  Yeah.  It was really cool.  Kind of a dopey move for somebody that knew it was counterfeit.  I'm going to get interest on this.  And he's like, well...  He knew I was fucked up.  Yeah.  He could see it.  Sure.  So he's like, you've got to get your shit together or else you're going to end up dead.  And then I got my shit together. 
[02:28:00]  Right after that?  And I'm not dead.  I'm here.  Right after that you got your shit together?  Well, it took about a month and then...  Yeah.  And then I was at home crying one night because I knew I had a problem and I called 411 and  got the number for a 12-step program.  You did?  Yeah.  And it all worked out for you?  And the female Stuart Smalley.  Yeah.  Wow.  So was this guy in jail overseas or anything?  He had to go back, so...  Deported.  Yeah.  But that's all that happens to you if your call was counterfeit money? 
[02:28:30]  Well, I'm sure other things...  He was in a little bit of trouble, but he just went back.  He couldn't come back here.  Oh, he probably jumped.  Do you miss him?  No.  They probably won't extradite you for something like that, will they, from England?  Like send you back to face trial here?  I don't know.  No, they didn't...  He...  I don't know who he knows, but he had just to go back.  Wow.  You were hanging with James Bond, I think.  James Bond.  Bond.  Yeah.  Yeah, so he was...  Yeah.  That's a great story.  My past.  This is the night.  That is your past, isn't it?  Wow.  Yeah.  And do you have pictures? 
[02:29:00]  A wedding picture and stuff?  I'll bring in a picture of him.  I got it.  Not a wedding picture, but of him.  A picture of him?  Yeah.  God, your story continues for the Opie and Anthony program.  Next time we run into you, we've got to see the wedding photos.  Got to see the picture.  All right.  Well, are you ready for the news?  Sure.  I don't have to do that.  People are asking,  did you ever tell these stories on XM Kids?  No.  When you were broadcasting.  Hey, kids.  No, because I was a good kid show host.  I was in a drunken stupor.  Let me tell you, pretty roulette wheel.  Let me tell you the time cricket muled heroin through Columbia. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, no.  I feel better about myself, because I really thought we were responsible for you losing  your XM Kids gig.  But now, I see that you have such a shady past that it was just a matter of time.  Just a matter of time before they caught on.  Right.  Helping John Malkovich stockpile cash so we can murder the president.  Yeah.  I thought she was sweet and innocent, and we brought her down this road.  She's been on this road for years.  And I'll tell you about my threesome with Pat O'Brien. 
[02:30:00]  That was great.  Her book is all, it's called Puppets Coke and British Cock.  British Cock.  And now we know where that came from, too.  What are you laughing at?  I'm not laughing.  Yeah, so.  What a story.  Yeah, my mom knows that I was married, so.  She knows the reasons why, because you're a drug use and stuff. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, she, yeah.  And then I went back home to the Joliet for help, so.  Yeah, and that's where you kind of dried out, went back home.  Dried out, yeah.  To dry out.  Wow.  And you haven't drank or anything?  For, celebrated, March 10th was my anniversary.  March 10th, 1994.  We've got to get her drunk one day.  No.  Do you ever have the urge?  No, in the first few years, yeah, but now, no.  First few years.  Wow.  Yeah.  There's got to be other things that have happened to you during these blackouts, 
[02:31:00]  where you woke up and went, oh, my God, what am I doing?  How about we save it for the next hour?  Oh, come on.  I got it.  The face she's making is like, uh-oh, there's a basketball team involved.  Did you ever come out of it naked and go, wait, you're not white?  Hey, neither are you.  All right, you want to hear another one?  I definitely want to hear a blackout story.  Yeah, give us one more blackout story.  I was working in Philly.  God, she goes right into it.  Oh, bam. 
[02:31:30]  Bam.  She's doing them alphabetically.  I was working at Philly one time, at Eagle 106 back in the day, and friends of mine were  working in New Orleans, and they're like, oh, it would be great to see you.  I'm like, yeah, you too.  And the next thing I know, I don't remember booking the flight, getting on the plane, but  I'm in New Orleans.  And the reason why I knew I was there is because all of a sudden, I hear a knock on  the door, and I'm like, where am I?  Obviously, I had to use the bathroom.  I'm in a gas station in New Orleans, and that's how I found out I was in New Orleans. 
[02:32:00]  I'm like, how long have I been here?  So you're just in a gas station, someone knocking on the door because they've got to  take a leave.  I guess I'm going to use the bathroom, yeah.  And that's when you came out of your blackout, and you looked around and went, where am  I?  Yeah.  And what, did you walk out and go, where am I?  Pretty much.  How did you find out you were actually in New Orleans?  He told me, the gas station attendant.  That is a good buzz.  And then I called my friend, and I'm like, I'm here, and she's like, yeah, I know, but  we lost you on Bourbon Street or whatever. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, wow.  So.  Holy Jesus.  She's just like quantum leaping all over the country.  All of a sudden, you just wake up.  That's got to be something.  I've never blacked out.  I've never.  You're not an alcoholic.  I've passed out, like I've been maybe feeling sick, and you go into the bathroom after a  night of all tequila or something like that, and then you wake up with a tile floor impression  on your face.  You're like, wow, I passed out here in the bathroom.  But you know that you were in the bathroom getting sick and everything like that.  But the thought of hours going by, plane trips, different cities, Bourbon Street, and 
[02:33:00]  then you just snap out of it in a bathroom in a gas station.  Wow.  Yeah.  You're getting your money's worth out of that booze.  I feel cheated.  It was a hurricane.  She's perfect.  Oh, a hurricane.  Those are great.  Those are strong, I guess.  She's perfect for this radio show.  We call it the Ben's hair.  The Ben's hair.  We found another misfit.  Yep.  Sorry.  No, don't be sorry.  Be proud.  It's the worst.  That won't be in Anthony.  Anthony, you just reminded me of something.  It's a quickie. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  A quick Hi, Mom.  Which one is that?  Hi, Mom.  I got fired from work for masturbating.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.

I started radio when I was 12.  Yeah, listen to that.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, we got your mom on the phone.  That was very hurtful, Jim. 
[02:34:00]  I just didn't sound like you.  I couldn't believe that was you.  You weren't sure, and you're pointing at me.  Is that your voice?  I'm like, yeah, it's my voice.  Hey, we're the only station that really rocks.  You're listening to Hobie and Anthony's show.  The Ethel Merman and Anthony show.  Things that swell.  We got your mom on the phone.  Well, I don't know.  I think when we used to record stuff back then, like, it recorded just slightly fast. 
[02:34:30]  Is that it?  Because there's a lot of old stuff that just sounds sped up a bit.  All high-voiced.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play hi, Mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really goable.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Hello?

[02:42:00]  I once saw bite a man's finger  because Vinny is a psychopath  you wouldn't know it  but he is  a psychopath  really?  loves confrontation  so this is like  trying to mix vinegar  and that other thing  whatever makes a douche  that's exactly what those two are  vinegar and a thing with a nozzle  that's what you have  with those two  another stupid saying  it's like  trying to mix vinegar  and oil  trying to mix oil  and water  I bet you it's never  going to mix  ugh  oil and water don't mix  less of course 
[02:42:30]  than a minivan  that's going backwards  into a lake  then oil and water  do mix  along with tears  and wispy blonde hairs  alright listen  we're going backward  hey  we're going backward  Patrice and Vinny go at it  on the worst of Opie and Anthony  say Jim  what's real?  the worst of Opie and Anthony  this is some sexual reference  I say don't you know  you say you're not alone  I say no  take me in  I say you're not alone  I mean you're a celebrity 
[02:43:00]  naughty  or whatever  Vinny over there  we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  in studio  Patrice O'Neal  good morning  a very very very funny guy  good morning  who's playing the stress factory  all this weekend  tonight tomorrow  732-545-HA-HA  H-A-H-A  and the owner of the club  is in studio  Vinny  yes  Vinny Brand  also a comic  and a good friend  very funny guy  in his own right  yes  and he was making fun  of Patrice O'Neal  basically saying 
[02:43:30]  Patrice say something  because you're not selling tickets  that's what you get  I can't figure out  how to be a celebrity  dude do you know  how awful I was  I went on sale  at the Bogota  do you understand  that like  an hour and a half later  there was still 40 tickets left  I'm like  what do I have to do  I'm like  you dick  it's a shame  I've been on  look if this was the 80's  somebody would know me  no one would know you  not even in the 80's  oh look at that awful haircut  Vinny had  oh please  they can't see that radio  yes they can  they can feel  my pain  watching that stupid bull cut 
[02:44:00]  with Frankenstein head  oh Vinny  that really is a prank  phone call  kind of head  oh it's price call  leave me alone  on the fucking phone call  without the phone call  your show sucks  that's the owner of the club  telling the headliner  he stinks  he stinks  wow way to sell the show  here's the part that bothers me  Patrice is definitely funny  nobody fucking cares or knows  whatever he's doing  it doesn't fucking help  I don't get it  I do not get it 
[02:44:30]  I'm trying to figure it out  tomorrow's sold out  we have a sweet 16 party  coming in  150 people  great  are you serious  they'll never come to the club again  so you can get sued  oh is that the wrong crowd for him  I'm only kidding  I wouldn't let him come in  I would not let him come in  there's young girls in that party  well there you go  Patrice is not a nice person  this is best of both worlds  Vinny's a comic and a club owner  this is beautiful  he has an inside track  on all the hackness  Patrice has been on  a self-destruction mode  lately with the clubs too  I love it  just chasing people out  two weeks ago  I love it  two weeks ago  at the comic strip  I'm on the showroom  I swear to god 
[02:45:00]  a girl left the fucking club  crying  not just crying  she was boo-hooing  she was running out  and her boyfriend  walking out with no balls  whatsoever  you walked how many people  that night  one  two  no  no  four  alright  there were six people  in the audience  going to comic mode  when we were at the comedy clubs  doing comedy  no comic counts that  just for that  I'm going to walk the 30 people  that's going to show up  this weekend  it's not a matter of  it's not a matter of  not being funny  it's just that 
[02:45:30]  they are offended  and upset  it's not that the jokes  aren't good  it's that he's just  a cocksucker  and nobody likes him  no  that's true  the people in the state  have a great time  I told you  I was in the hospital  there was a candlelight  visual for my death  they were praying  for my death  oh believe me  as soon as he woke up  people were like  fuck  fat motherfucker  prayer ain't shit  you know how many 
[02:46:00]  comedy sales comics  are going  come on  taking bets on my death  no not me  I'm just paying you  why do you and your friends  hate me so much  Vinny  I don't hate you  as much as you think  but I am paying you  with a check this weekend  in case you drop on Monday  you know what's making me mad  that cock  this mother  he  tried that out on me  really  you don't try material out on me  and then  you never said it  there's two fucking things I want  number one  if you drop on Monday  that wouldn't be terrible  and I'd like that little recorder 
[02:46:30]  that little fucking Sony recorder  I'd like that to be mine  and the funny thing is  I heard it last night  when I was there  he said it again  he certainly did  but I would need a baseball bat  to the back of your head  come prepared  oh  see that's a tough crowd reference  him  him and his smarmy friends  all used to say  I never was prepared  for a tough crowd  what is Anthony Clark doing  outside the studio  who is that guy  I don't know  it's a little scary  well Patrice was in the hospital  you're all good now  yeah I mean  taking care of yourself  yeah  alright  no you're not  you're not

[02:53:30]  yeah New Brunswick  known for not liking black people  they don't  New Brunswick  Newark  Camden  they all hate black people  they're known for black people being there  but not for liking them  well maybe those two things go hand in hand  oh my god  look at Vinny upset about the fries  Vinny  don't worry  not upset about the fries  he has delicious fries in the back  they are fucking good  Vinny's  I will say all kidding aside  Vinny's food is good 
[02:54:00]  and if you don't like it going down  believe me  three hours later  it's great coming up  how much of my food  has been shit under your chest  the funny part of that joke is he thinks I'm a rookie and I waste it on the chest  what am I an open microphone  his chest was two years ago  passe 
[02:54:30]  oh shit on the chest  it's so 98  oh god  shit on the chest  you should headline your own club this weekend  he does quite often  yes he does  maybe it'll snow tonight  because you'll get off  that is the worst though  when you headline  except for this last time I did okay in Baltimore  but every other time  I've had 30 people there on a Saturday  and you just look at the staff  what are you talking about?  like when you're in a club  if it's empty 
[02:55:00]  which the Baltimore improv for me has been brutal  a couple times  well are you on in Baltimore?  now we are  it's okay  yeah that's why they don't show up  no if you're not  if you're anywhere that they're not  don't listen to the rest  who knows you stupid  that's what I'm saying  you're about as unknown as me  if it wasn't for Opie and Anthony  that's not true  you jackass  he did Spider-Man  he was in the movie Spider-Man  I mean I couldn't be as unknown as you  he's six foot eight and invisible  no one knows me  how do I just happen? 
[02:55:30]  actually I think no one knows me  unless I did Opie and Anthony  I'm unknown  in the 80's I'd be somebody  it's amazing how  why do you keep saying  in the 80's?  because  what do you do in the 80's?  I'm saying  are you a hack?  the things  wait this is people in the business talking  I've done four movies  I've been on Conan O'Brien  about six times  you sound like a whiny bitch right now  you sound terrible  just start saying funny shit 
[02:56:00]  maybe people will come see you  I'm trying to sell tickets  to your stupid hat club Vinny  have you done six comics?  you sound like you're begging  who's booking that?  who's booking Conan?  that's the awful comedian  interruption  who's behind you?  damn it  I'm not whining  I'm just saying  now people know  you're selling tickets  I'm really busting your balls  it's going to be good  I know what your stupid hair do  just shut up  was that doctor  a bob or two  at the same time?  root canal  and trim  you jackass  there's nothing wrong  with Vinny's haircut  if you're on a stage 
[02:56:30]  singing  put it down the ribs  there's nothing wrong  you really do have a hat head  I can't believe  I'm watching a fucking  dying black man  give him dental advice  and you give me hair advice  what is upside down  about this fucking world?  you have no head  to speak of  god almighty  before you insult me  can you just pick up a receiver?  it makes no sense  it says unless you pretend you're a cop  hey  Norton  Leobald 
[02:57:00]  here's two free tickets  y'all ready to laugh?  732-545-4242  for tickets  thank you Jim  ha ha  that's a stress factor  it's going to be good  it's going to be very good  we have a very special  that's convincing Vinny  no let me tell you something  it's actually  it's a good show  but Big Jay is also  very fucking funny  yes Jay is he killed  last night  Jay Oakerson is a very funny dude  as much as I find him  annoying off stage  with his awful fat face 
[02:57:30]  and smoking habits  between Jay and Patrice  this is the fattest show  I've ever bought  this is a fucking really  I'm really scared  of the food bill this night  I can't eat food  that's a place in the morning  it's a wrap  you can  no  you even fry your lettuce  maybe a fried Greek  cheese  maybe a fried  a fried Caesar salad  Vinny Dipson Caesar salad  and flour  Aime Wright

[02:59:30]  to another human being  and they just  they're really running  I can't wait  till she dumps him  she's got to wait  for some more change  she's got to wait  for Voss to make her funny  he would be heartbroken  what I can't wait  is till they fire him  from the show  they have together  oh  and she'll have to go  look I love you  but I have to think  of myself too  it's for us  I'll do it for us  I tell you  I gave  I thought  it's lasted a long time  so far  I thought it'd be over  but you know  I'll be there to pick him up

[03:01:30]  but he was fucking  chaining Little Lisa  into the thing  and punching head  on the throat  did you hear what  he said to her  he handed her the box  and said  he turned around  and walked away  and said  you can say no  if you want to  how fucking sad  how fucking unbelievably sad  what a low self-esteem  you think he was  the same size  kneeling down  asking the marriage  as well  saying no  little fingers  putting the ring on  the awful hands  she probably jumped  twice before she said  alright I do 
[03:02:00]  just don't touch me  no more  alright alright  yes  he has awful  claymation hands  they don't bend  take doll fingers  just leave the ring  on the pillow  I can't wait  until Bonnie leaves them  I just can't wait  all curled up  in the shower  washing off  trying to hold  his face  with his little  Davy and Goliath fingers  back to the pipe  back to gambling  back to booze  I cannot wait  till boss is back  put him right over  the top  sell this house  for a 
[03:02:30]  sell this house  for a hit  sell that connected  to another house  mansion  hey Patrice  I think I found out  why people don't like you  you're not nice  you're not a fucking  nice guy  like you don't have  a nice thing going on  one of my favorite  tough crowd moments  was awful Patrice  Jeff Garland  was on the show  and Jeff said  some joke  that just bombed  and Patrice is like  you're on a fucking  improv show  and that's the funniest  thing you can say  and Jeff just  broke out  and he goes  what are you  going to fucking 
[03:03:00]  bust my balls  oh I hate that  Fred Flintstone head  he just really bugs me  every time I see  his smarmy giant head  makes me want  to try to get candy  out of it  that fat  hit it with a  broomstick  you're going to  curb your enthusiasm  really  that makes me laugh  about as much  as a lamp  I've never seen it  by mistake I think  nothing was working  except for HBO  is it overrated  whatever man  you know you can't  even talk about 
[03:03:30]  certain things  in your careers  where people  oh it's a curb  whatever  that moon head  I'd like to shove  his head right in the  toilet like Mickey  Rourke  did you get to the  I can't even say it  oh the trainable  no  trainable  well we can do that  we have to end the  week by getting rid  of this  the trainable audio  and don't play the  ones we've heard  it hurts  we got four that  we haven't played yet  but first I mean  Patrice O'Neill is  going to be playing  Vinny's Club  this weekend 
[03:04:00]  Stress Factor  what's the number  again there Jimmy  and I like the way  Vinny did this  because what happens  is you incorporate  part of the mood  into the phone number  which I thought  was just a super idea  it's 732-545  ha ha  that's like  that's like a hospital  going call us at  1-7-4-3  ow  ow  1-800  that's  1-800 
[03:04:30]  and leave off  the last tumor  for saving  545-4242  but that comes in  a ha ha  which that is  absolutely fantastic  what a coincidence  yeah  I paid extra for that  yeah and he fought  hard for that  we said we  well we got  giggle giggle  do you want that one  no  no  it's got to be  ha ha  you're fucking stupid

[03:05:30]  black and white  father's day in  black and white  yeah  like one black  guy one white  guy you know  both dads  probably different  points of view  and fucking  Keith's credits  because this  fucking  finished idiot  hammer it you  fucking moron  hammer it  next thursday  I've already sold  more seats than you  you cocksucker  it's a great  I have a fucking  150 on the book  for thursday  that's a great show  thank you  but Keith's credits  on that fucking wall  I wanted to throw  that paper into the urinal  he said he was on  star search a couple  of years ago  a couple of years ago  they didn't say a couple 
[03:06:00]  yes  like Keith is  this up and comer  Keith is 46 years old  it's the new one  on PAX  that's what he's talking about  we still have his head  shot that says  pudge him on it  fucking Keith's first sets  now are on the game  show network  he is fucking  an old finished man  he really is an old man  now  that credit list is awful  you look at all these  impressive credits  and then you realize  oh those are the people  he's open for  I told you  every time he's on stage  after he finishes a joke  he reintroduces himself 
[03:06:30]  he's a big emcee  you  that's brutal  that's brutal  Anthony are right over there  oh yeah  he's just wiggling his tongue  around him  it's like stroke face  and the worst part is  I know it's gonna wear off  and the pain will come back  how long did he say it would stay  at least until you get to the other place  yeah you go to the other dentist 
[03:07:00]  yeah but that wears off too  I gotta  yeah but when there's no nerve man  if they get the nerve out  you can't feel anything  it's not gonna exist  the pain's gonna be gone  I think the penicillin's gotta  penicillin  you get pain medication though  from the other place  they'll prescribe something  you'll be fine man  you'll be fine  tell him to take that nerve out  and if you get it out  and then you'll be like  out  let's go to Mark  Mark what's up buddy  not much  I'm wondering  if Jimmy Norton  when you call her a hoker  you got 1-800-HO-HO  I wouldn't have mind

[03:08:00]  when you think about it  oh my god  this next bit  Travis Tritt in studio  Washington loves  this interview  really  they love it so much  that I'm telling you  right now  I've heard this interview  5 or 6 times  5 or 6 times  why are we replaying  the Travis Tritt interview  we've never replayed it  Anthony  that's the answer  how did you hear it  other channels have  other channels have it  it's been all over  the XM platform  because they thought  our interviewing 
[03:08:30]  skills were just  just on  on  oh boy  fire  fire would be good  how about that  on point  on point would be good  on the money  no there's something else  I'm trying to come up with  our interviewing skills  were  impeccable  impeccable  flawless  flawless  a force to be reckoned with  a force to be reckoned with  unrecognizably good  sure that too  I didn't mean that  I meant to say  undeniably good  oh undeniably good  I said unrecognizably  we pulled this interview 
[03:09:00]  out of our back pocket  though man  I mean  who thought Travis Tritt  was going to be a good  guest on this show  I remember panicking  going Travis Tritt  we don't know much  about country  I've heard the name  and for some reason  we all just got along  and it was a lot of fun  I'm annoyed  I missed him too  he's a very famous guy  that would have been  a great photo op  oh of course  I was away  busy like  the worst  of opie and anthony  I like it anthony 
[03:09:30]  I like it a lot  Travis Tritt  outside the studio  making his way in  he's playing the  House of Blues  here in New York City  tonight  House of Blues  House of Blues  yes  there he comes 
[03:10:00]  popping on in  there he is  there he is  Travis Tritt  how you doing  good good  how you doing man  doing great man  yeah  got stuck in some  of the city traffic  yeah well you know  you're in New York  what can you expect  that's kind of the deal  it really does  it's really not much  different than Atlanta  though  I'm from Atlanta  oh boy  we got something  in common  you know  we almost took a radio  job down in Atlanta  and they were  trying to convince us  that Atlanta is just 
[03:10:30]  like New York City  it really is brother  in some respects  I mean  we didn't see it  I got it  they took us  to some redneck bars  Anthony and I  we've seen a lot  in our years  and we were  kind of scared  well I think  they call it  like the New York  of the South  and believe me  that's exactly  what they were telling us  believe me  you know years ago  when I first got  into the music industry  you know everybody  kept telling me  you know you need  to move to Nashville  which at that time  Nashville had no  sports teams  whatsoever  they had no good 
[03:11:00]  restaurants  they're still working  on that  you know  they're trying  to get that together  but it was just  I said what in the world  am I going to do  up here  you know  so I stayed at home  stayed in Atlanta  and at least had  decent sports  and decent restaurants  at least you had music  though in Nashville  you know  like if you're going  to Nashville  at least you got music  which you know  the surprising thing  Music City USA  and there's no places  to go  or at least  there weren't  at that time  to go hear live music  in Nashville  really anywhere  it was surprising 
[03:11:30]  really surprising  you would think  you know  the whole image  you have in Nashville  is every corner  you're just  Music City USA  yeah  it's on every sign  going into town  and  we got to tell you  Atlanta has so much  crazy stuff going on  too  oh yeah  it fascinates  Anthony and I  it really does  we were down there  interviewing  just really fast  maybe get your take  on this  this whole freak Nick  thing that happens  yeah  holy crap  oh yeah  that's all I have  to say is  holy crap  yeah  we were stuck  in traffic  because 
[03:12:00]  three cars  across the whole  highway we were on  were stopped  and people were  dancing on the cars  yes  and we're like  oh boy  I'm surprised  they were just  dancing on the cars  this is how  we saw some stuff  that might have  looked like dancing  yeah exactly  this is how  it was told to us  it's spring break  for black colleges  and they go to Atlanta  and they'll just  yeah you'll be  on a road  a highway  and they'll just  stop in the middle  because they are  feeling the music  and they jump up  on their cars  and they're dancing  and stuff  and some of the 
[03:12:30]  dancing  it looked like  guys were just  having sex  with girls  well that's basically  yeah  that's pretty much  this must be  this must be a few  years back though  because the fact is  they've turned it down  no they stopped it  wow did they  yeah absolutely  well and they  couldn't actually  come in and  you know just say  we're just going  to shut it down  but I think the  Georgia State Patrol  sitting on I-75  watching every single  car that came  into the state  from any  outside borders  you know automatically 
[03:13:00]  you know if it's  loaded up  they're going to  pull them over  and probably  somebody's going  to jail before  they ever even  get to Atlanta  so they sort of  put discouraged  people from  coming in and  doing that deal  you got a  tail light out  boy  one of those  good old boys  you in a heap  of trouble  boy  nothing better  than that  nightstick  coming out  and cracking  the tail light  yeah there's  a whole thing  going on  the shopkeepers 
[03:13:30]  were boarding  up their businesses  and they told us  they told us  flat out  get out  you got like  two days  everybody  I mean you  think about the  people that live  there  people coming  through town  and coming  through their  yards  at all hours  of the night  and using  their shrubbery  for restrooms  and waking up  in the morning  and there's  somebody having  sex on your  porch  just not fun  not fun  absolutely 
[03:14:00]  absolutely not  man  well it's great  to be here guys  thanks for having  me  thanks for coming  we really don't  get that many  big stars coming  through here  we had  Ozzy Osbourne  came through  which was cool  Ozzy's quite a  character  he is man  and we had  Sunset Thomas  today  Sunset Thomas  we had  porn star  Sunset Thomas  porn legend  man  Sunset Thomas  last time I saw her  now this is a weird  story  last time I saw her  I was in Las Vegas  about a year or so 
[03:14:30]  ago and Carrot Top  was doing a show  out there  of course he was  Carrot Top  was doing a show  so I've known him  for quite a few  years and call him  up and yeah  you've got to come  out to the show  tonight so we go  see the show  afterwards we go  back in the dressing  room and there's  this barrage of what  looked like the  circus had come to  town you know of  people coming down  the hallway  and I start  recognizing someone  it's like that  looks like although 
[03:15:00]  I wouldn't know  really what he looks  like but that  looks like that  might be that guy  Ron Jeremy right  there and then  you know the whole  group Sunset Thomas  the whole I mean  the whole bunch man  they were back there  Ron Jeremy we've  had him on the show  a lot he's a lot  of fun oh what a  trip must have been  the porn convention  I don't know what  was I think they  were just in town to  see Carrot Top  which really yeah  yeah I don't know  I don't think so  I don't know what  the association is there  I don't know what  that's all about  maybe they like  maybe they like  Carrot Top's buff  body  I've never seen a 
[03:15:30]  guy that spends  more time on his  body than Carrot Top  that shouldn't have  to  no doubt  like your god damn  Carrot Top  why do you have to  why do you have to  be the strongest man  in the world  how much arm strength  do you need to hold  up a toilet seat  and make a joke  about it  Jesus Christ  he was sick of  people making fun  of him  I guess so  you know  when you're Carrot Top  you gotta be able to  kick some ass  I guess  no doubt  that's great  I was looking through  your bio a little bit  and first of all  a couple of things  in common  that I have in common  the divorce thing 
[03:16:00]  yeah  I saw that  but I saw it twice  yeah  and anytime I see this  I gotta ask  how did you get  suckered into getting  married after one divorce  well you know  I got married  the first time  when I was just a kid  I was 18 years old  right out of high school  just  I got married  more than anything else  to get out of the house  you know  and also to prove  my father wrong  who said  this is gonna be  a mistake son  and it's like  well  you know  I'll prove you wrong 
[03:16:30]  guess who was right  yeah  he was  but I  I got out of that thing  about two years into it  and then  it was sort of a  you know  turnaround on the rebound  I had  I had just come out  of that divorce  and I  also had changed  the way I made a living  I was working for a  heating and air conditioning  company up until that point  that's the second thing  that we have in common  yeah  did you do that  duck work  no kidding  really  that's what I did  up until  94  I'll be darned 
[03:17:00]  addicts  200 degree addicts  yeah  oh god  pumping units up there  there you go  cutting your hands  on clinch collars  oh yeah  I still got scars  man  all over the place  yeah  everywhere  everywhere  you just come home  with your hands  like chopped meat  it is just  thankless work  and that's because  you chose not to suck cock  well that's what  Sunset Thomas  and now we gotta  explain to Travis  Sunset Thomas is in  and she said  at one point  she's eating ramen noodles  and living 
[03:17:30]  on a mattress  in some room somewhere  yes  and  she's at the crossroads  of her life  yeah crossroads  of her life  and that's when  she decided to go  into the porn industry  and Anthony before that  said well  I was doing the same thing  eating ramen noodles  and living in my car  but I didn't have  the option of  you know  sucking cock  thank you  so eloquently  you know  I had to go  and then decide  I was going to  have to work  for a living  and got into  sucking cock  and started  sounding like  a good idea  when you were  in something  Jesus Christ 
[03:18:00]  you know  when you  have your dreams  and stuff  because everybody  does  and I'm sure  you had your dream  to become a star  with music  I had mine too  I was in bands  through my whole life  and working your ass  off  humping tin  up in these attics  that's a fact  and you just have this  you know  that there's gotta be  something else  out there  that you look  at your co-workers  a lot of them  are cool guys  but you look and go  this guy is just  cut out for this job  absolutely  he will never go  any farther 
[03:18:30]  than this right here  this is his life  but  and I don't want  to sound like  I have this  overinflated  self image  but there was  always something  that said  I am not meant  to do this  until I get older  there's like a dream  and you want  to do something else  mine  I did always want  to do radio  or do something  in music  and you know  how did you get  the break  where you were able  to get out  of doing that  well you know  after that first  marriage ended  I decided  you know what  if I go out  and try this thing 
[03:19:00]  now  and if I fall  flat on my face  nobody is going  to suffer but me  you know  I'm the only one  so I figured  why not  you know  as they say  in Vegas  no balls  no blue chips  you know  so it's like  go for it  give it all you got  and I quit  my regular job  went and took  a gig  playing in a club  just doing  a solo acoustic  thing  and I think  the booking  was for like  a month  and after that  I didn't know  where the next  paycheck was going  to come from 
[03:19:30]  you know  but it's like  you've got to do that  you've got to go out  and give it a shot  and try  if all else fails  you're back in the attic  there you go  that's one thing  they always said  get yourself a trade  just in case  you know  I understand  my mother was always  saying that  I appreciate your dream  and what you want to do  but get yourself a trade  thanks for the vote  of confidence  thanks mom  something to fall back on  something to fall back on  yeah that's it  you ever heard that  you can do anything you want  don't sell your tools  you can do anything  yeah I still keep  WD-40 in my snips  but I went in 
[03:20:00]  and they used to have  Marlboro cigarettes  used to have a talent contest  years ago  where they would go around  from in all the major cities  where they had this big  concert tour  and they had all these  different people  in the country music world  I think at the time  they had like the Judds  and Randy Travis  and Ronnie Millsap  and different ones  that would headline  this concert  and they would do  a competition  a talent competition  in each city  and if you won  that talent competition  you got to open  for that band 
[03:20:30]  that concert  and you had to send  in a professional tape  I had no money  I had no connections  to anybody  with a professional  recording studio  but I did have a friend  of mine  who was an electrician  and he was wiring up  a studio  a home studio  for a guy  and he said  listen  he called me one day  and he said  I think I can probably  get you some free studio time  as a favor to me  you know  and it's something  how things work out  I go in  and I record this thing  I just did like three songs 
[03:21:00]  that I had written  and as it turned out  the guy  who was  having the studio done  at his house  was a vice president  for Warner Brothers Records  at the time  and he'd been  he'd been working  Madonna  and Prince Records  and Rod Stewart  and the Doobie Brothers  and ZZ Top  and you name it  and he's got all these  gold and platinum records  hanging on the wall  and I walked in  and he came in  about the second song in  as I was recording  and when I got done 
[03:21:30]  in the control room  I walked back  in the control room  and he said  where have you been  all my life  and you said  uh oh  yeah  one of those guys  he might be  in the porn industry  no it was one  of those situations  where you know  he said  you know  I really think  you could  maybe do something  and go somewhere  and we ended up  recording a little album  in that studio  over the course  of the next year  and he took it out  to LA 
[03:22:00]  and played it  for the executives  at Warner Brothers  and the rest  was sort of history  amazing how stuff  like that worked out  yeah man  it's just you know  one of those  it's truly a lucky break  right place  right time  right place  right time  did you take care  of that guy  uh yeah  yeah  he made a lot of money  I can imagine  he made a lot of money  who the electrician  uh no  the guy that hooked you up  the guy  the guy that hooked me up  yeah  I took care of him too  I had to take care of him  yeah  I took care of him too 
[03:22:30]  yeah  he's putting flex  on clinch collars  and some after  right  god damn  Travis Tritt  he's got my old job  he brought me  the stinking  ex-lax watch  he's supposed to  take care of me  here's your  come on the radio  son of a  god damn  that's something  we got a call earlier  from uh  somebody that said  you don't  you don't do the  quarters song live  oh yeah  no I do  you do  you know  I had  I had to threaten 
[03:23:00]  not to do it  um  and uh  we actually have  an announcement now  every night  before the show  actually Larry the cable guy  uh huh  recorded it for me  and uh  he came out on the road  and did several shows  with us uh  uh  a few years back  but uh  it's  it's one of those things  I was on stage  when I first started doing  here's a quarter  call someone who cares  somebody got the  the bright idea  that the  the thing to do  would be to pitch  quarters up on the stage  what is this  Rocky Horror  you freaks  it was the electrician 
[03:23:30]  yeah it was the electrician  trying to beam you  you know  the weird thing is  is that apparently  this is something  that's kind of  going on  I was talking to  some of the guys  from Leonard Skinner  you know  Gary Rosman  he's a good friend of mine  and he told me  that years ago  when Skinner had a song  called uh  Give Me Back My Bullets  which was basically  talking about  give me back my bullets  on the radio  you know  on the chart  you know  if you're moving up  the chart  that's number five  with a bullet  well that's what the song  was talking about  but they basically  they came in  and people thought  it was talking about 
[03:24:00]  live ammunition  which they brought  to concerts  and then threw  up onto the stage  it was madmen  can you believe that  and somewhere  that same mentality  transferred over  into this song  and when it first  started out  it was actually  kind of cool  because we were  playing little  small clubs  and stuff  you know  it wasn't  anything really  really huge  if you threw  from the back  of the room  that's probably  about 50 feet  so you know  it's not a big deal  right  but you know  you start playing  big arenas 
[03:24:30]  and stuff  you try to get  a quarter  from third row  balcony to the stage  you've got to  hurl that son of a gun  you know  so I was on stage  one night  in Bristol Tennessee  and playing  a big arena  up there  and somebody  threw one  I don't know  where it came  from  but I got hit  just above  the left eyebrow  and it  I thought  I'd been shot  I mean  it just literally  it was like  one of those  things  I could picture  my head  going back  it looked like  JFK 
[03:25:00]  in the Zapruder  film  you know  and I immediately  you know  I thought  what in the hell  was that  and I looked  down at the  front of my guitar  and there's just  blood  just you know  gushing down  the front of my guitar  and so I turn around  I ran back  to the drum riser  and I grabbed a towel  and I put it up  on my head  and I thought  well okay  I'm going to be alright  this is going to  stop any second  and I'm thinking  I'll walk back up there  and start singing  well you know 
[03:25:30]  you can't stop  the blood  and I walked back up  to the microphone  and now I'm starting  to get dizzy  it ended up  stopping the show  and for a while  I thought  how are we going  to deal with this  you know  this is one of the  biggest hits  of my career  at that point  and you know  at the very beginning  how am I going  out in a suit  of armor  playing this  a lot  wearing riot gear  Kevlar  put up the chicken wire  like in the  Blues Brothers movie  there you go  that's it  man  but we actually 
[03:26:00]  we started  my manager at the time  told me  he said you know  let's try making  an announcement  basically just letting  people know  that you know  that never works  because it's such  a huge song  it's not one of your  songs that you could  just ah we just  won't play it anymore  like a b-side  or something  exactly  it's one of those  that people are  going to want to hear  yeah so you know  we basically just  put the word out  that okay look  if that does  if that does  happen again  obviously it stops  the show  and you know  really you people  are the ones  screwing yourselves 
[03:26:30]  because you know  I've already gotten  paid so it doesn't  make any difference  you know  but it's  it actually did work  surprisingly  surprisingly enough  we do a lot of stuff  in front of our fans  yeah  and when we have to  make these silly  announcements  different fans  and the manager  of the club  or the place we're at  is always begging us  no you have to  tell them this  and as soon as we  tell them it just  gets worse  if we told our  audience  people please  keep breathing  they'd all hold  their breath  until they drop dead  that is the type  of audience we have 
[03:27:00]  that's the difference  in audiences  just dedicated  to the old  F you  you know  they don't care  I was surprised  actually that it  did work  but I was glad  that it did  because we've been  able to do the  song ever since  yeah  but country's  a way different  audience  it's people  from 8 years old  to 80 years old  that are in  these country shows  yeah but they  all have quarters  when's the last  time you saw  an 80 year old  woman heave a  quarter from  the third balcony  did you guys  collect a lot  of money  wrap it up  in our pen  that was the  cool thing 
[03:27:30]  yeah  you got the  beer money  right  the band  and the crew  would go out  you know  and take the  money  rake the money  up off the  stage every  night  and buy  either  you know  beer for the  bus  or they'd buy  like video  games for the  bus  or you know  whatever  you know  sunset  thomas  videos  you know  whatever  whatever  it may be  that kind  of thing  did you ever  go through a  point where  you were still  working for a  living but you  heard yourself  maybe on the  radio or  had you cut  you know  I had pretty much  I had pretty  much gotten  completely out  of it at that  point but it  was I still 
[03:28:00]  remember the  first time I  ever heard  myself on the  radio man it  was just and  to this day  it's it's still  something that  quite frankly I  can tell you  everywhere I was  exactly where I  was when I  heard any of my  singles on the  radio the first  time really  because there's  still something  new about that  you know it's  just it's just  the greatest  feeling in the  world to be  able to to  know that  that was  something I  mean when I  was a kid  growing up you  know listening to  the radio and  that's that's 
[03:28:30]  that was a  dream I'm  making it yeah  I never ever  thought I would  ever be amongst  those people you  know I never  thought I would  ever even get a  chance to meet  half of these  people and and  much less get  played on the  radio so for  me it's kind of  like I feel like  I won the lottery  every day you  know I'm a  lucky guy and  and it's it all  goes back to that  that first time man  I remember you  know the band  and I we were  going up to do  a showcase in  Nashville we'd  all packed into  this into like  two rental vans 
[03:29:00]  that we had  panel trucks that  we had rented  and we were  driving back from  Nashville and we  just about had  lost the the  radio station  there just about  completely faded  out but they  came on and  said coming up  next that new  single from new  country artist  Travis Tritt and  we pulled the  vans over on the  side of the road  on the side of the  interstate and sat  there and waited  for them to play  the song and it  was just like  this is this is as  good as it gets  you know you're on  the road you're  playing music it's  on the radio 
[03:29:30]  that's it  were you humping  your own gear at  the time oh yeah  man doing everything  you know it's funny  because when we hire  people now you know  and regardless of  whatever job it is in  my organization I  tell them I say you  know there's not a  single thing that you  guys and I'm gonna  hire you guys to do  expect you to do that  I haven't done  physically at some  point your own  lighting oh yeah  man run your own  soundboard rig your  own lighting uh  schlep your equipment  in and out of the  place you know  greater appreciation  for what the other  guys are doing  absolutely man  absolutely  like shit  that's a fact  so and it's got a  and it's got a 
[03:30:00]  similar story about  hearing himself on  the radio the first  time yeah because you  guys do have a lot in  common I'm not I  would do uh I would  I always loved radio  did a lot of song  parodies uh with my  band that I had uh  years ago and they'd be  played on the radio and  um I used to go on  Opie's show um he was  on BAB out on Long  Island and uh the  morning guy yeah we  started working  together but I couldn't  get him uh you know  aboard yet so he was  like so I was still up  in the attic doing the  attic and tin and  stuff right so uh for  some reason the morning 
[03:30:30]  show guy would take  Opie's show like funny  parts of Opie's show  and play him on his  show really like give  him some time you know  notorious radio guys  they're all a bunch of  pricks whatever they  whatever they could get  that'll burn another  five minutes and it  you know and he  would never say  where he never give  credit for it or  anything oh so this  was like one of my  song parodies and I  hear it kick up in the  morning I'm I'm under  something you know just  probably tarring of  this picture that's  going through a rooftop  you know and it's 
[03:31:00]  just I'm in I'm in  hell and I hear myself  on the radio and I'm  like this is pretty  cool no recognition no  name that it was me  nothing oh he just  comes on all right we'll  be back after this  commercial I'm sitting  there cut up covered  with tar just sitting  there with a tear in his  eye I'm like why isn't  this as cool as I  imagined it would have  been thank god things  from that point on got a  little better oh thank  goodness a little 
[03:31:30]  different than Travis's  story you get a kick in  the ass every so often I  think it just gives you a  better character well you  know I think that's that's  that's how we I think we  become better people better  better performers you  know people that are  handed the whole thing  yeah a silver platter or  they're just they're a  created personality yeah  uh they're they're bound  for failure it's going to  be very short-lived and  they're not going to be  able to handle it well  that's not going to work  with their people well you  can't be treating the  people like crap you can't  you know be a prima donna  all the time uh you know 
[03:32:00]  sometimes these sons of  bitches have to keep them  in line I found the  evidence you're carried  away like a mr humble  here but uh you know it  does it just makes it  better it makes it easier  to work with people yeah  I think you know there's  so many people in this in  this industry especially  there's so many people that  they only thing they know  is they want to go to  Nashville or wherever they  want to go to Los Angeles  they want to go to New  York and they want to be a 
[03:32:30]  star right and that's just  pretty much as far as the  dream goes and it's not  really well thought out and  it's not uh they don't  know anything beyond that and  I think that's where a  lot of people you know  you get especially in our  industry you get a lot of  people that come in and you  have people at record labels  or whatever in in all their  infinite wisdom that try to  basically say you know you  need to do this you need to  dress like this you need to  sing like this you only need  to do these type of songs  blah blah blah blah blah and  and so many of these people  sort of go along with that 
[03:33:00]  because they don't really know  any better well it also it  must be rough though early on  in your career when you  really are close to that  making a point and you're  like I might not want to  screw this up by telling this  guy no you know did you have  to deal with it I did I did  when I first started out I you  know I had the long hair you  know my hair was down I look  like Greg Allman you know it's  a long hair thing and and all  the rest of the guys I came out  in 1989 with Garth Brooks  Clint Black Alan Jackson Vince 
[03:33:30]  Gill you know all these guys  clean-cut guys wearing the  pressed jeans look like you  know come out of a you know  cowboy catalog you know and  me I look like you know  something out of a biker bar I  had long hair or black leather  completely different than any of  those guys and I had a lot of  grief from a lot of record  executives and stuff that said  you know we need to do this we  need to cut your hair we need to  blah blah blah blah blah and I  resisted it for a long time but 
[03:34:00]  at the same time you know you're  young you're new and you don't  want to rock the boat too much  you're kind of glad you finally  got an in right you don't want  to screw it up so I sort of went  along with it I went in and and  got the haircut did that whole  program think you're going to be  back in that attic going oh my god  man I did I do I was so ashamed of  myself because I compromised you  know at that point and after the  first album hit and we had you know 
[03:34:30]  we had success and and you know  we had like platinum albums  happening and that sort of thing  then you can come back in and say  okay now I'm going to start calling  some shots here here's the way it's  going to go you know and that's and  that's sort of been where I've come  from and I'd make him cut his head I  would have but he was bald did you if  you ever meet any of these legends  that were probably heroes of yours  that god man you know I've been so 
[03:35:00]  lucky I've had a chance not only to  meet him but I've had a chance to  work with well now you're like you're  one of their peers so and you  probably think you know these guys  are the legends but but now you're  looked at as one of these their peers  that must it's it's really you know I  pinch myself man because the fact is  is that you know growing up you know  guys like Johnny Cash Waylon Jennings  Willie Nelson Hank Williams Jr.  Merle Haggard George Jones Ray Charles  huge huge fans of all these guys and I've 
[03:35:30]  had a chance to work with meet record  with do movies with all of these guys yeah  and it was just you know it's like a  dream come true the last one was Ray  Charles I for years I wanted to work with  Ray because more than anybody else I  thought he really affected the way that I  sing what comes out of my mouth when I 
[03:36:00]  sing was more influenced by Ray Charles  than by anybody and I always wanted to  work with him and and came like this  close you know numerous times and for  whatever reason at the last second my  our schedules would screw things up and  it just never happened we finally about  almost three years ago now got an  opportunity to to work together to do a  special together for for country music  television and I went out to his studio 
[03:36:30]  in Los Angeles and the two of us just  really hit it off we came back in we did  this one-hour concert work together and  then the the really cool thing was after  it was all over with you know I was just  I was really happy that everything had  happened the way that did and I'm  getting ready to leave and his one of  his tour managers came up to me and said  listen Ray wants to see you back in the  dressing room and I go back in the in  the dressing room and he says listen he  said I'm gonna give you all my phone  numbers he said I want you to call me and 
[03:37:00]  I said well that's very nice I appreciate  and he said no no no you don't  understand he said I'm not the kind of  guy that says call me and then says you  know I hope he doesn't you know I want  you to really call me and so we did we  we became really good friends we stayed  in touch we call each other you know  and talk to each other at least a couple  times a month he would fly out to shows  from time to time see me play and you  know it's just a great thing I mean you  know I said I could die tomorrow a happy  guy you know yeah I got to work with 
[03:37:30]  everybody I ever wanted to what did you  think of the movie man I thought was  fabulous the first time I saw it as a  matter of fact we were doing a concert for  a foundation that Ray had started to to  raise money for Morehouse College down  in Atlanta and Bill Cosby hosted this  thing in LA and I got to be a part of  that and we were one of the first to see  the film and I said right off the bat I  said if Jamie Foxx doesn't win an Oscar  for this something's wrong and of course  he did I was really really thrilled he 
[03:38:00]  got the whole essence of Ray down  everything yeah it was perfect at the  expense of his sanity from acceptance  speeches I've seen him have a great job but  you're insane  talk to his grandmother I don't know the  half of it they yelled cut step out of  the carriage  the phones are jammed we should get a  few people on the line with Travis Tritt  here before we get out of here  Bubba make it fast you're on with Travis 
[03:38:30]  I just wanted to ask how it was playing  with B.B. King and all them and the  Blues Brothers keep out oh that was  really cool you know what I got to do  that thing we went up to Canada a few  years ago and and shot that film and  getting to be on stage with you know  people like Eric Clapton and and you  know just all the greats that were in  that film man it was it was like a who's  who of imagine playing with Eric Clapton  yeah you're sitting you're on stage 
[03:39:00]  going oh god don't look at me don't  look at me I was I was I was standing  over and you know in the guitar section  of this big band for the Blues Brothers  2000 movie and which I thought the best  part of that movie was the music you  know the script I think was a little  lacking the the guitar section I'm I'm  standing between Jimmy Vaughn and Eric  Clapton and you know I mean we've got  Billy Preston behind us playing keyboards  and BB Kings over here and Bo Diddley

[03:41:00]  might for the oops sorry good you might be  thinking about about the Billy Ray Cyrus  controversy that's what you're thinking  about that after Billy Ray Cyrus came out  with that big huge record which was you  know being played everywhere ad nauseum  achy breaky heart you know and I came  out and basically said at the time that I  didn't care for the song and boy you know  someone had to say it you know I was I was 
[03:41:30]  working in rock radio and they made us  play it really thinking that this was going  to be that yeah the crossover things it was  awful it was just one of those things  where it just it it it it struck me right  off the bat as being exactly what it was  kind of a novelty record and and you know  God forbid somebody come out and say that  at the time you know but I I did and I  said it unfortunately right at the time  when it was you know at its hottest point  so the press took that and ran with it
