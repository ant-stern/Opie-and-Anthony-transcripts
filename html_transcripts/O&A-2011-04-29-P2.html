<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the main show, featuring an interview with Kevin Pollak, which was later discussed in the "After ONA Live" segment.  This segment, hosted by Sam Roberts, initially saw Anthony hesitant to participate before eventually joining Opie and the discussion. The "After ONA Live" segment largely focused on a post-mortem of the Pollak interview, with Opie and Anthony concluding their own poor interviewing skills at WNEW were responsible for its perceived failure, citing Pollak's subsequent successful appearances elsewhere as evidence.  The Royal Wedding was a significant topic, with the hosts delivering unscripted commentary focusing on Prince William's appearance (specifically his hair, or lack thereof), his kiss, his wife's attractiveness, and the extravagant hats worn by the attendees.  Roland, the show's producer, voiced his frustrations regarding the difficulties of booking guests, mentioning the challenge of securing Opie's cooperation and mentioning a female cast member from *The Office* as a potential future guest.  A caller named Andrew from Brooklyn, who had a noticeable speech impediment, called in to share a fun fact about the Space Shuttle Endeavor's construction, resulting in a humorous exchange.  Ron Bennington was a guest during this segment.  Troy, a show associate, also participated, discussing his weekend DJ gigs in Redding, Pennsylvania, and his band "I Want to Kill You's" upcoming performance, which involves planned on-stage vomiting.

Notable moments throughout the broadcast included Opie's sudden and unexplained departure from the studio,  Opie wiping his ass with a microphone windscreen, and Anthony making a homophobic slur directed at Sam Roberts ("Sam Roberts is a fag").  The discussion around the Royal Wedding contained several humorous observations about the appearance and behavior of those in attendance.  Andrew's call was noteworthy due to his speech impediment.  Roland used colorful language, including the phrase "a dick in my ass," to describe his experiences booking guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Trick to Anthony, you're still in the studio.  You're still here. Come back to the mic.  He's not talking.  Opie?  Mars?  Master Paul is still here. No, that's rolling.  Ant was determined to get out of this studio.  But you're still in this studio. 
[00:00:30]  You have to talk when you're in here.  Look at the light. It says on air.  Come on.  Opie, will you talk?  Oh, yeah, I heard that voice.  All the mics are on. All of them.  Mumble something.  Say something. The people love to hear your voice.  It legitimizes this hour.  Me and Ant had a real moment after the show today.  What happened?  We realized that we really sucked at WNEW  when we were broadcasting our show.  All right, I'll talk. 
[00:01:00]  Yes!  I told you I'd get her done.  Sam Roberts is a fag.  Oh, man.  You want inside stuff?  That's what I love. You know that.  And I got to say this carefully because, wow, were we wrong.  Now, we weren't sure if we were going to have Kevin Pollack on the show today, right?  Yes.  And the only reason for this, by the way, is not because we don't think he's funny.  We think he's hilarious.  It's not because we think his impressions suck because they're the best in the business.  And acting, he's great.  And he certainly holds his own with acting.  For sure. 
[00:01:30]  But we remember when we were at WNEW and we had Kevin Pollack come in, and it was a dud  of an interview.  Yeah.  So that's what we remembered.  So we kind of...  So you were afraid that that would repeat?  No, we were kind of blowing it off.  Like, ah, Kevin, I think it didn't really work last time.  Unfortunately, some guys just don't work on the show, even though they're really talented  and have great careers.  And then we had an epiphany.  You did.  No, hold on.  But me and Ant were going back and forth.  We're like, I don't know.  And then I ran into Kevin on the way out yesterday, and then Kevin went down to our office to  say hi yesterday.  So I got a hold of Ant. 
[00:02:00]  I'm like, why don't we just fucking give it another shot?  And as you just heard on the show, he fucking killed.  He killed.  He's great.  He annihilated.  So right when the show was over and Kevin said his goodbyes and stuff, I look at Anthony,  I'm like, wow, maybe it's us.  Maybe we suck.  I was like, maybe we sucked back then.  It was just the fact that we sucked at doing interviews back then.  So you think the reason that this worked today is because of how far you two have come  as broadcasters.  How great we are now.  He's probably the same guy. 
[00:02:30]  He probably would have been great at NEW, and we blew it.  So that's why we sort of haven't really had Kevin on over the years, because we just  had that one bad appearance by him, but now we're thinking it was us that day.  We were probably pissed off at management or whatever.  Here's why this is a dangerous situation.  You two both admitting this on the air now gives cause to Roland to every time you guys  say, oh, we've had him on.  It didn't really work.  Roland's going to say, well, maybe it was just you.  You did that.  Maybe it was just a good way to tell him.  Are you trying to tell me he's on the phone with Balloon Guy right now?  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Maybe Balloon Guy was here.  And Dustin Diamond.  Screech from Say By The Bell.  Should we give those two guys another chance?  Give me a chance.  Because the fans will vote those two as the worst interviews ever.  Ever.  You could put a poll up today or tomorrow, a year from now.  No, Steve the Whistler was a great interviewer.  I know.  That was great.  It was just not great for him.  No, not for him.  For us.  Legend.  Legendary.  One of the great uncomfortable moments.  But how much did we blow that?  Kevin was great.  I know.  He really was.  He was fantastic today.  Fucking funny as shit.  And I loved hearing all those inside stories. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, inside stories of famous movies, great impressions.  The guy's fantastic.  You know what's great?  Now that he's back on our show, he's going to be the one to say, ah, fuck you guys.  I don't need you.  And the next time we try to book him.  Screw you.  But what was also amazing is he said he was a fan of this show, and then he actually cited  something.  I know.  They never cite anything.  They never cite anything.  He did.  That's just that entertainment bullshit.  Oh, I'm fans of you guys.  And then you call them out, and they're like, uh, I don't even know who's Opie and who's  A.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  They don't know shit.  And you didn't even have to ask him this time.  He goes, yeah, a few weeks ago you were talking about Independence Day, and you guys  were like, we were, goddammit.  We were talking about Independence Day a few weeks ago.  Kenny's waiting for me downstairs.  Let him wait.  In my car.  What's the M going on?  I'll listen to me if I make it down fast enough with the fucking delay.  I don't know if you'll make it down.  I'm happy I've infected two microphones now, so this is cool.  Oh, yeah.  I got tuberculosis on mine, and I got AIDS on this one.  Could you go over there for a second and just breathe into that one time?  Really?  No, because now Opie doesn't have to use it anymore. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, you have to.  Can I see that windscreen for a second?  I mean, I guess it's your studio.  Yeah, please.  All right.  Yeah.  These things are tight.  Oh, wow.  Let's just take the whole microphone off.  You don't really need it.  Yes, I do.  Wait a minute.  What are you doing with that?  Oh, you're coughing into it.  I didn't see that coming.  I'll throw it to him.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Opie's putting it down.  He's wiping his ass with his mic screen.  Oh, my God.  That thing is diseased now. 
[00:05:00]  Put it back on.  It's got ass cough.  Put it back on, Sam.  You know what you have to do if you want to still work here.  All right.  Be a good soldier.  Just do it.  Be a good soldier.  You know, I went running for you today.  I did exercise for this show.  What are you talking about?  You weigh three pounds.  Who cares?  We're actually disappointing you that you ran, because we were using that as filler.  You were coming back too fast.  Oh.  We should have sent to Iraq.  That's not right.  We'd still be on the air.  Iraq, I'm sorry about that.  Oh, Iraq.  Keep up the 552, because if I was you, I would do the same thing, if no one was paying attention. 
[00:05:30]  I'm getting out of here.  Have a good weekend.  You know, this is also Fez's windscreen.  Take it easy.  Where are you guys going?  That's it?  Bye.  That's it.  Now it's your turn to shine.  Well, I appreciate that sentiment.  And, Obi, you're leaving too?  You can stay.  What happened?  Hold on.  I've got to find out.  What happened?  Well, I want to know too.  Leave the door open.  What are you laughing at?  I've got to get out of here.  I'm so sick.  What's happening out there? 
[00:06:00]  I'm turning the...  I'm turning these all the way up.  What happened?  Um, the...  The guy that refuses to be on the air?  Gary?  Yeah, he's waiting outside the studio.  So now he's ready to talk.  Guess what?  I talk on my time.  Yes.  And that's when I'm on the air.  You know what this means?  What?  You're going to stay on the air longer so you don't have to go out in the hallway.  I have nothing else to say.  I had a very mediocre show today.  I disagree.  The show itself was great.  The Royal Wedding conversation. 
[00:06:30]  That was the best Royal Wedding coverage you'll get anywhere.  And everybody was covering that thing today.  And we were just winging it.  You guys were just...  You didn't have any of that scripted.  No, it was kind of fun.  You were just going for it.  Then...  I think Prince Williams...  I'm starting to wonder if he even likes girls.  Just because of the kiss?  Because his wife there is really hot.  The kiss was completely lame.  And he's like very bashful.  And he looks unsure of himself.  And when they replay the coverage and stuff, look at the wave. 
[00:07:00]  The wave's a little...  I think he's also very...  The wave's a little...  He's just very self-conscious because he's got the whole country looking at him as like a monarch.  If he was self-conscious, he would have done something with his hair then.  He doesn't have any.  His hair looks horrendous.  There's nothing to do with it.  Put a hat, put a wig on, borrow one of Elton John's wigs.  Elton John's wigs, yeah.  He could pull off what Elton John did.  Just have the horseshoe and then all of a sudden...  Ah, full head again.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:07:30]  Who was the bigger queen during the whole thing?  Well, I don't know if Prince William is actually a queen.  No, I was thinking Elton John or the actual queen.  Who's like the bigger queen there?  Who's England's greatest queen?  Yeah.  I mean, Elton John's had way more hits than Queen Elizabeth.  I think Elton John would do very well in the biggest queen of England, Pole.  I think so, too, because he's beloved and he had the Princess Diana song.  What I don't understand is I haven't had a comb in this hair in, fuck, two decades easily.  That's hard to believe.  Elton John has a wig and he can't have a wig that has normal combed hair? 
[00:08:00]  Listen, I saw Elton John in person when I one-questioned him.  No, you didn't.  I did.  One-on-one, face-to-face.  What was this?  Well, you played it on the air.  It was like last week.  It wasn't long ago.  It was a Tribeca.  It had to be last week.  It was on Thursday.  We played it on Friday.  One week ago today.  Oh, wow.  Seven days.  I wish you would have told me.  You played it.  You're the one who played it.  And it was memorable and funny.  What about him?  That wig looks way worse in person. 
[00:08:30]  Does it really?  Than it does on television, yes.  Well, we were talking about this.  I don't know if we made the air yet, that a lot of these TV people, when you see them  out walking the streets and stuff, they look complete.  Oh, no.  It was right after Bob Kelly, Bill Burr, and Joe DeRosa.  We were all hanging out downstairs after the show so Bob could feed his stupid nicotine  habit with Joe DeRosa.  So we were hanging around.  And Kenny was just standing there, not contributing anything.  It's his job.  And we were having a whole discussion.  When you see actors or local TV guys, what have you, on the streets, they look completely 
[00:09:00]  ridiculous.  Like they have jet black hair, even though they're in their 60s.  Or they have horrible facelifts and face work done in general.  And it's all made so they look kind of good on TV.  But when they're walking around their regular life, which they do way more than actually  being on TV, they look completely ridiculous and stupid.  Jess and me saw Debra Messing walking around one time from Will and Grace.  Oh, yeah.  And she had probably four inches of makeup on her face, just in case paparazzis were around.  But it doesn't look natural walking around day to day. 
[00:09:30]  Just, yeah, it was spackled on.  Yeah.  It looked like she was wearing like a mummy mask or something.  And what's up with these hats?  Well, I was actually in one of the clips that I gave you.  I didn't think we did when we were doing our coverage.  I don't think we did the hats justice.  These hats look ridiculous.  Matter of fact, we could play that clip now.  We still have the clips I gave you this morning.  You didn't turn them over, did you?  Yeah, the royal wedding clips.  I didn't even see them.  Listen to this.  You gave me clips I didn't play? 
[00:10:00]  Yes, I was watching the royal wedding coverage pre-show.  It's not a hat if it looks like at any moment it's going to fall off your head, right?  I mean, they have to be pinned on with some kind of major adhesive.  But then it's not a hat.  If you pin it on, it's not a hat?  No, we should come up with another name for it.  New bit.  If the thing looks like you have to tilt your head this way to keep it on your head,  look, I'm doing a visual joke for everyone, then it's not a hat.  If it doesn't fall off, it's not a hat. 
[00:10:30]  Right, there you go.  This is Ann Curry.  I understand a little bit of a tilt, but now they're wearing them where they're plastered  on the side of their head.  They're literally on the side.  Like someone had to mush the hat onto their head.  This is Ann Curry before the royal wedding at like 5 o'clock in the morning talking about  the Queen's hat.  Ann is at Westminster Abbey.  Ann must be very exciting there right now.  It really is.  It's such a privilege to stand here and watch all of this.  When the Queen arrived, the crowd shouted out, I think, the biggest cheer so far this morning. 
[00:11:00]  Another point, there were odds being taken.  People were betting on what color hat the Queen would wear.  And the odds were that she was going to wear a yellow hat.  And she's never actually seen in public without a hat.  I was supposed to share that clip with Opie, but he ran out of the studio.  Roland?  Yes.  Did you get a yes or a no?  I got a dick in my ass.  That's what I got.  A big cock right in my ass. 
[00:11:30]  I love guest pitching days.  And I know he wasn't in a good mood because Opie snuck out of here while that clip was  playing, the bastard that he is.  And I saw him.  He literally, he jumped out of the studio and made the quickest left turn I've ever seen  anyone make and ran past Gary to the elevator.  Gary was chasing him, trying to talk to him.  Yelling, um, I don't talk.  Show's over.  Is that what he said?  Yes.  What was he saying?  That's all he said.  And then he yelled.  So as he's running, he's yelling behind him, I don't talk.  Show's over.  He said that once and then he ran. 
[00:12:00]  Now, where does the Opie and Anthony show get the reputation that we're difficult to work with?  I don't know.  So you've got a big dick in the ass as far as guests go, huh?  Yes.  You do.  Your vibe is very much defeated right now.  It is.  You don't like this.  I don't.  You put a lot of time into guest booking.  You try to get them to see it your way.  You put in the extra hours.  You've been to Opie's house multiple times, just spending hours there trying to wean him 
[00:12:30]  down.  Yes, sir.  And the guests always end up being good.  I don't know.  There's a small show.  I don't know if the audience heard of it.  It's called The Office.  You're bitter.  Yes, I know.  I never heard of The Office before.  Who from The Office?  Can you say?  No.  If I hadn't said, can you say, you probably would have just said.  No, I wouldn't.  But it's somebody from The Office.  Yeah.  Male, female.  Female.  She has a big movie coming out.  But who cares?  Oh, I know who it is.  Okay.  It's a female from The Office with a big summer movie that's about to come out. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  Called Bridesmaids.  Yes, I love that movie.  It's awesome.  Well, then everybody can obviously...  We have to have her on.  I guess it's not up to me, is it, Roland?  Uh, even Jesus knows who she is.  But Jesus knows who everyone is.  That's a bad example.  I know.  Then why'd you use it?  I don't know.  Poor guy.  You've been through a lot.  You sit down and take a load off.  I know, but she's on...  She was on Kimmel.  Did she do a good...  Craig Ferguson. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, she's going to be on Fountain, but...  Did she do a good job on the late night shows?  Yes, she's really funny.  She's got a lot of good...  And she's done a lot of videos.  Her...  She did, like, in one interview, they can do, like, an awkward pause, and she killed.  She killed?  With her awkward pause?  No, she did that, and, like, she has funny stories.  So she pauses and does funny stories?  Well, no, they ask her, can you do the awkward pause, and then, like, how they do it, and  she did it, killed.  Good timing is what you're saying.  Perfect.  I don't know if the awkward pause would work as well on the radio, but...  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  I think she would.  Yeah.  I think she would.  Hopefully, Roland, but you didn't get a no, or you just got a dick in the ass?  I just got a dick in the ass, and then a slap in the cock across my face, because  I ran away, so I got nothing.  Well, Roland, um...  We have to, uh, play a little clip for everybody, because today's a...  Please do, there's tears in my eyes.  I know there is.  Today's a special day.  Really?  Uh, it's the last space shuttle flight of the space shuttle Endeavor.  Yeah, we passed on the astronauts. 
[00:14:30]  We did.  Oh, by the way, uh, Opie distracted me before, no offense to Opie, but, uh, you should all  tune in to Jim's show on the Boneyard tonight.  It's on at 10 p.m. Eastern, of course.  Tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern on the Boneyard, Jim Norton obsessed.  He's interviewing Jack Osborne.  Or, see the replay of The Office from last night.  It was really good.  No, listen to Jim Norton obsessed.  He's interviewing Jack Osborne.  As a matter of fact, he talked on this show right after he taped it.  He was riding high.  He was very excited. 
[00:15:00]  I'm going to be listening.  I hope you are, too.  That's tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern on the Boneyard.  Jim interviews Jack Osborne.  Now, as I was saying, the Space Shuttle Endeavor takes its last flight today.  The Space Shuttle Endeavor means a lot to this show, and that was because of a caller  that started calling in to the K-Rock show in 2007.  It was a very odd thing.  E-Rock, did we ever find out what this guy's name was that you remember?  Andrew from Brooklyn.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  He had a severe speech impediment that he was extremely unaware of. 
[00:15:30]  It ended in hilarity.  This is it.  Of course, everybody should remember, and if you don't, then enjoy with us, the Space Shuttle  Endeavor, right here on After O.P. Anthony Live.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  It's Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  The Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Um, you know, the Space Shuttle Endeavor, you know, the Pirate City, the Space Shuttle Endeavor 
[00:16:00]  was actually, was actually built.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The, the what?  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  The, uh.  The Space Shuttle Endeavor.  All right, wait, it's, uh, hold on, let's don't roll with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes.  All right, Andrew from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Okay, you're on the air.  What's up?  Um, Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Um, that space, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger and the... 
[00:16:30]  Something about the Challenger.  Uh.  Andy!  I can't hear him.  What, what?  You can't hear him either?  No.  What ship, uh, was built for, to replace it?  I said Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  What?  What Endeavor?  What?  Are we talking about, uh, what are we talking about?  No, it's, it's fun fact.  Oh, fun fact.  Okay, so what's your fun, what's your fun fact? 
[00:17:00]  It's what, Space Shuttle Endeavor was built to replace Challenger and the parts that was,  the parts that were used.  The, the what Endeavor?  I didn't hear that.  The Space Shuttle.  Yeah, uh, okay, but which one, bro?  You talking about...  Yeah, which one?  The first one, and then there's another one.  What, I keep, is my, my, my...  Hold on, I'm getting a thumbs up from Tim.  The, we, we, uh, tweaked it?  All right, we got, all right, the phones are working.  Go ahead.  All right, you're gonna have to start over, sorry.  Start over, sorry, Andrew. 
[00:17:30]  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the Space Shuttle Endeavor, the part, the shuttle that replaced Challenger Endeavor  was actually built with spare parts from the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis that were  left over when they were finished built.  From, from what?  And they finished building both.  The Atlantis?  No, I said Space Shuttle Endeavor.  It's spare parts.  Hey, the parts that were used to build it. 
[00:18:00]  Excuse me.  Yes.  The, um, the parts that they used to build the Space Shuttle Endeavor came from...  I said it again.  Yeah, it came from...  It came from Space Shuttle's Atlantis and Discovery.  Because they finished building...  They finished producing the Space Shuttle...  Excuse me.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm sorry, I have a bad phone.  No, continue.  No, your phone's fine, dude.  It's a good phone. 
[00:18:30]  That thing was messing up, though.  So, wait, wait, I don't understand, though.  You're saying the spare parts were used from Challenger?  No, excuse me.  I'm saying Space Shuttle Endeavor.  The material that was used to build Space Shuttle Endeavor...  What about the other space...  What's the Challenger?  Yeah.  So that was built to replace it.  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  And the spare parts...  I mean, all the parts that were used to make Endeavor came from Discovery Atlantis... 
[00:19:00]  Came from Discovery Atlantis because they were finished...  They already finished building them.  And they stopped producing Space Shuttles after Atlantis.  Right.  Atlantis was built in 1985.  So then...  All right.  So they took those spare parts and made what?  Yeah, sum it up.  So, uh, the what replaced the what with the what?  Endeavor replaced Challenger.  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Right. 
[00:19:30]  And...  The material that they used...  Yeah.  ...to build Space Shuttle Endeavor...  I can't get it now.  I can't get it now.  From Discovery and Atlantis...  Oh, God.  Wow.  So the Space Shuttle...  In...  What did he say?  Endeavor?  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  What is it?  Special Endeavor.  What is it again?  Say it. 
[00:20:00]  You've got to be clear, dude.  Say it loud.  Yeah.  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that, uh...  Well, it is fun fact Thursday.  You mush mouth.  We all, uh, we all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  Yeah.  Whoa!  It can't be.  It is.  Yes, it is.  It's the great Ron Bennington.  Oh, gosh.  You don't have to say that, but thank you.  Right here on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:20:30]  You know, there's only, uh, the only greatness right now is Pippa and the Young Prince.  Yes, that's the whole thing for me.  Have you been following?  Do you have Royal Wedding Fever?  No, as a matter of fact, they don't.  I'm just getting it now.  Good, good.  I'm getting caught up on it.  I'm trying to get a weird hat to wear.  We spent, uh, the first hour and a half of the show just watching Royal Wedding coverage.  Well, you know...  We got to be there live as it happened.  Oh, and I are Anglophiles, and they have been for quite a few years.  Uh-huh.  They love everything British.  Yeah.  Anything that's European. 
[00:21:00]  That's why...  White European.  That's why Ricky Gervais feels so safe here.  Yeah.  Because they are Anglophiles.  I felt like it was a little stereotypical when Ricky Gervais was here, because Roland, uh,  texts me, and he goes, hey, could you get Ricky Gervais some tea for when he comes out?  Right, sure.  I'm like, oh, come on.  He wants coffee.  He doesn't really want tea.  Well, you know, uh, another person who's an Anglophile is Jeremy Coleman.  He was born in England.  Yeah.  Raised here.  But he does end his emails with cheers.  I knew that.  I was just about to say he ends his emails with cheers. 
[00:21:30]  And I will tell you this.  At NEW, I talked him into it, uh, bringing in his childhood picture when he went to the  school with the little shorts and all that.  Oh, he had the uniform and everything?  Yeah.  That's great.  Basically looking like he was playing with ACDC.  You know how you're always telling, uh, guys like me to get out there and do something  with their lives?  Yeah, get out there and do it.  You know Troy from, first of all, do you know Troy from our show?  Of course I know Troy.  Okay.  You know he's actually doing something with his life?  What are you doing, Troy?  He's DJing.  Yeah, I'll be DJing this weekend. 
[00:22:00]  He's in the clubs.  Actually, tonight and tomorrow.  Making the girls go crazy.  But let's get across.  Are there discs?  Or if you just brought your laptop from home, what are you doing?  Well, the word DJ has sort of evolved over the years.  I mean, before, you know, it was two turntables.  Uh, but I actually use a program where I actually remix and mash up stuff on the fly.  Oh, like Shuffle on iTunes.  Do you even need to be there?  Why don't you just mix it at home, send it to the club?  Email it.  Because what you need to do is you need to feel the vibe of what's going on in the club at that time. 
[00:22:30]  So if they're feeling a hip-hop set, you aim more towards hip-hop.  If they want to dance, you have to bring in more dance.  And then you just, from there, you just kind of mix in other stuff and have fun with it.  Where are you doing this at?  It's actually at a new club in Redding, Pennsylvania, called Club Reverb.  All right, I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be in Redding.  You're going?  Yeah.  Well, I'm already supposed to be in Scranton.  What are you doing?  Tonight and tomorrow night.  All right, I'll be in Scranton.  I'm going to ride over.  I'm going to drive over from Redding.  Both nights?  Yeah, both nights.  Watching the great Ron Bennington.  Tomorrow's a better night because my metal band, I Want to Kill You, is getting back together and playing a show tomorrow night as well. 
[00:23:00]  Why be negative, though?  No, it's just the band name.  No, they're in your face.  Oh, I see.  They're in your face.  Yes.  I want to kill you.  Are you going to do that thing?  You told me something you thought about in rehearsal.  Are you going to do that thing?  We can't get one of the guys on board.  Can you say what it is?  We want to come all out on stage and we all want to vomit to make ourselves vomit at the  same time.  You want in your face.  I do.  That's just right.  That's in your face.  How about cock socks? 
[00:23:30]  You going to come out with the cock socks?  That was already done.  Okay.  All right.  Forget it.  All right.  Thanks.  Vomiting has never been done now?  You know, I can't think of a band who all came out on stage and vomited at the same  time.  How many guys are in the band?  Five.  Five.  I don't think four out of five guys puking would be fucking great.  No, because I'd be in the crowd looking at the one guy like, what's his fucking deal?  Yeah, like what a douchebag.  I bet once everyone starts puking, he'll jump in.  Yeah.  I've had that happen before in my family.  Oh.  Thanksgiving is a weird time, though.  It is.  All this stuff happens. 
[00:24:00]  Once somebody starts to go, the whole family does.  Yeah.  Well, Troy, I mean, if you're going to be there and the great Ron Bennington is going to  be there.  It's going to be a party.  It's going to be a party.  I would go, but I got special delivery I got to do.  Oh, please, keep me away from that guy.  Fucking Dave is out to kill me right now.  Because of the 15?  I own 15.  I own a 15.  And we're doubling down.  I'm trying to gamble my way out of it.  He's giving me a chance to double or nothing.  See if you can get a 30 out of it.  Yeah.  If it's 30, forget it.  I'm fucking leaving New York.  Yeah.  I'm not paying that kind of money.  I'd rather fucking seriously live on the road. 
[00:24:30]  Well, I mean, this is what you get for starting to become a bookie.  What can I do?  This is what you get.  I'm a bookie for one guy, though.  It's too much.  Well, we got to go so you can do your thing on your show.  Yeah.  We're drinking Hennessy today.  You are?  Yeah, we're drinking Hennessy.  Maybe me and Troy will hang out for a while.  All right.  Because we like to party down ourselves.  I didn't know that.  We'll all puke.  So, the vomiteers in Redding.  Yeah.  Redding, Pennsylvania, tonight and tomorrow night.  Reverbconcerts.com.  Check it out.  Okay.  Thank you very much, Troy.  Thank you.  The great Ron Bennington, as always.  We'll see you next week with more Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live.
