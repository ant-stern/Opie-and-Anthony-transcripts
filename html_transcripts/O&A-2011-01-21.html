<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their controversial past and on-air persona.  The hosts – Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton – immediately launched into their characteristically crude humor, starting with jokes about Geraldo Rivera and his Willowbrook exposé, which devolved into graphic descriptions of defecation, masturbation, and violence.  The conversation then shifted to the recent arrest of 127 mobsters, prompting humorous speculation about their activities and the invention of ludicrous mob nicknames like "Mush Russo" and "Greg Stinky Sweats Hughes" (referring to co-host Greg Hughes).  They discussed organized crime's history, its links to politics, and the perceived disparity in consequences for politicians versus mobsters.  Anthony Cumia then delivered a sarcastic Public Service Announcement about driving safely during an impending snowstorm, which quickly veered into more offensive jokes.  The hosts further digressed into the difficulties of obtaining driver’s licenses, advocating for absurdly rigorous testing procedures, punctuated by more offensive remarks.

The show continued with a quest for Entenmann's Crumb Cake, complicated by mislabeling and unwanted variations.  This led to a discussion of the hosts' personal food preferences and childhood memories centered around budget-friendly snacks like Ramen noodles and Hydrox cookies, interspersed with anecdotes about their upbringing. They also discussed the scarcity of Entenmann’s in Midtown Manhattan. This segment included reviews of three poorly-received New York Jets-themed songs submitted by various DJs, including Chunky from 92.3.  The hosts, after criticizing the submissions, created their own highly inappropriate Jets-themed songs.  John Montone was mentioned as a past guest from Pittsburgh, and Jim Kerr and David Hinckley were also referenced.  The segment concluded with their disappointment at receiving mini frosted donuts instead of the desired crumb cake.

The next segment was dominated by the creation of explicit parody songs about Rex Ryan, New York Jets coach, featuring graphic sexual content.  Listener calls contributed to the increasingly absurd lyrics.  This was interwoven with a disastrous "treat day" involving subpar Pop-Tarts and a missing coffee cake.  A recurring joke centered around an off-site person, possibly a retired police officer, responsible for the treats.  The poor quality of the donuts further fueled the comedic chaos. A caller recounted a frightening experience on a 1978 "Scared Straight" program, and the conversation briefly touched on a documentary about obsessive Tiffany fans and a viral video of a woman falling into a mall fountain.  The hosts also discussed upcoming guests, Tiffany and Debbie Gibson, and planned a "franchise" show concept, culminating in anticipation for a planned "gas off" bit.


The show then turned to discussions on Piers Morgan's declining ratings, Oprah's OWN network struggles, Ricky Gervais's career resurgence, and a listener's call about a Jay Thomas impersonation contest.  A significant portion involved an enthusiastic and detailed breakdown of the Angry Birds game.  The in-studio arrival of Debbie Gibson and Tiffany marked a major shift in the show.  The segment featured playful banter, reminiscing about their careers and Long Island.  The hosts expressed surprise at the success of the celebrity interviews, discussing upcoming projects with the singers, including a movie and a concert appearance. A Schecter guitar and amp giveaway was also mentioned.


Finally, the show concluded with a discussion focusing on the hosts’ imagined chances with Debbie Gibson and Tiffany. They speculated about a double date, using suggestive humor and hyperbole to imagine various romantic encounters.  This conversation was briefly interrupted by the singers' increasingly agitated publicist, and a commercial break for "I Hate Steven Singer" (gold-dipped roses) interrupted their fantasy.  Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous listener calls were incorporated, often resulting in further off-color exchanges.  The Gatoro Meister Music Tour contest giveaway was also mentioned.  The show ended with  speculation on the sexual preferences of Adolf Hitler and a discussion of which languages were best suited for oral sex.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m., an out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cring style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wow.  What an intro, man.  Every day now, I'm like, how do you live up to that?  How do you live up to that?  You just don't.  No.  Nah.  Got a great big intro. 
[00:01:30]  And it's really like the old school, the Al Capone's vault show.  Is it?  You know?  Remember that?  The big build up?  God, how old are you?  And then they opened the vault and what happened?  That was the first kind of reality show.  Wasn't there an old beer bottle or something?  An old whiskey bottle.  Was it a whiskey bottle?  It was an old whiskey bottle.  See, that's the difference between you and I.  I knew it was some kind of bottle, and you know the exact bottle.  An old whiskey bottle.  An old whiskey bottle.  And fucking dummy standing there going, well. 
[00:02:00]  It made his career.  Yeah.  For some reason, that made his career, even though it was a bust.  Or his comeback or something.  I don't know.  Talking about Geraldo Rivera.  Geraldo.  Also, the, well, he used to be a legitimate news guy with that Willowbrook expose.  Oh, yeah, he was.  I remember seeing that.  That was like the first kind of hidden camera news expose that they do all the time now.  And it was the retard place over there.  Where was that?  Staten Island?  Do they have that on Staten Island?  Holy shit, that place is insane. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Literally insane.  And they were showing like retards shitting themselves and jerking off and getting punched in the face.  And Geraldo went in there, exposed the whole thing, and they made his bones.  How great would that be as a life?  What, being able to jerk off and shit yourself?  Jerk off, shit yourself, and punch people in the face.  It is a dream come true.  With no repercussions.  That's all I have planned for this weekend.  It's going to be called.  I'm just going to jerk off, shit myself, and punch people in the face.  You're having a Willowbrook weekend?  Willowbrook weekend! 
[00:03:00]  It's a Willowbrook weekend on 99.9 FM, blah, blah, blah.  Willowbrook weekend.  Willowbrook weekend.  Yeah.  It's a snow weekend.  Yeah, snowy, cold.  I'm just going to stay home.  I do have another PSA.  You do?  Yeah.  You said you're going to stay home.  I just wanted to jump in really fast and say that now that I'm kind of part of the Academy,  I got all the latest releases, so I'll be catching up with the releases this weekend.  It is nice being part of the Academy.  No bootleg copies for me. 
[00:03:30]  You're just part of the Academy.  Part of the Academy.  Some of these screeners even have my name.  Welcome.  Welcome, Greg Hughes.  Welcome.  Great.  Enjoy True Grit and tell us what you think.  I feel the same way because mine all say, welcome, Greg Hughes, also.  Well, then, fuck it.  Don't fuck it.  That's so strange.  Mine says that, too.  I know.  I made it for you.  Don't fucking dump my coffee.  I don't need the FBI.  It's great.  Did they tell you the FBI is going to be knocking?  Knocking?  Or are they too busy with the mob?  You mean for the yesterday for the mob thing? 
[00:04:00]  You think they're coming to my house?  Fuck, man.  We lost a lot of friends yesterday.  That sucks.  What happened?  I'll tell you this much about the mob thing.  And I know we're going toward the PSA.  I didn't forget.  No, it's okay.  The mob thing, really quickly, I would rather see them arrest all the politicians.  Yes.  Same thing.  In my stupid life, the mob never did bad by me.  Mob never hurt me.  Mob doesn't go out just randomly fucking people over.  Nope.  What the mob does, it's illegal.  But what the politicians do, it's the same thing, mob tactics to get your money. 
[00:04:30]  And it's barely legal what they're doing.  You know, you've got politicians that can't figure out how to spend the money here in New  York State, New York City, Jersey, but they're arresting mob guys.  I say you don't arrest the mob guys.  You arrest the politicians and move the mob guys in.  Let them do it.  They know how to balance a budget.  Capone was running Chicago pretty well before, you know, things got a little hairy.  Hey, 127 mobsters, mobsters arrested here in the city and the Northeast. 
[00:05:00]  Why yesterday?  It's the culmination of a giant investigation.  So this has been going on for a while, and they finally decided that was the day to go  in and nab these guys.  From what I hear, there was a cumia involved.  Nice.  Congratulations.  I was like, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, but since my father and grandfather were only children, it would have to be real back. 
[00:05:30]  No, you're related to that guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, you just don't know how yet.  Really?  You think so?  Yeah, because cumia is such a...  It is, and I've never heard of another...  I've never seen another cumia.  When we were kids...  Never met one, never seen it in writing.  I know.  When we were kids, we used to look in the phone book whenever the new phone book would  come for cumia.  I'd see what other assholes had your last name.  I'd do that, too.  Yeah, and there was never any.  And then one day, we cracked open that phone book, and living somewhere in Queens was a 
[00:06:00]  Bertha cumia.  Oh, shit.  Bertha.  What was Bertha about?  I don't know.  Never called her.  Never gave a shit.  But it was like the first one...  That you saw.  ...that we saw.  And, yeah, that was...  So yesterday...  They arrested a cumia.  They arrested a cumia in there.  And, I don't know.  I don't know what he was doing.  I think a probably pretty low-level guy.  You know, it wasn't Don Cumia.  Not one of the big guys.  Probably just, you know, an earner. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Probably just out there earning.  Just an earner.  Just earning.  Can we get the FBI on the phone or somebody today?  I don't think they talk.  They talk.  They just changed their names.  I don't think they talk.  I want to know why they arrested all these guys yesterday.  I mean, one guy was in the mob for 60 years.  What the hell did he do wrong?  I guess he was doing...  He was successful.  Seems like he...  Doing well.  Seems like he was keeping his nose clean.  And out of nowhere, they arrest him after 60 years?  Yeah.  That's got to suck.  That's like fucking Pauly from Goodfellas.  It's like, I ain't going to fucking die in prison wither away like... 
[00:07:00]  And that's what happens.  You just end up rotting away in prison.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then they go to the court during the trials with the oxygen mask, looking all sickly.  What are you going to do?  Hey, have a good trip.  Good trip, guys.  That's all I want to say to the 127 from yesterday.  Good trip.  My theory is really simple on this one.  They just want to get the tax money. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  Yeah.  They clean up the mob thing.  Because you don't really hear about the mob anymore.  So they're doing their business.  Not really a big thing.  They're wheeling and dealing, but obviously not paying their taxes.  So you arrest all those guys, and then other legit people move into those areas, and then you get the tax dollars.  Yeah.  It's all about money.  Well, some of the safest areas used to be, like Gotti's neighborhood.  Oh, yeah.  John Gotti, boy, he'd put on the fireworks displays on the 4th of July, and there was no crime in Gotti's neighborhood. 
[00:08:00]  I would have lived in Gotti's neighborhood, no problem.  I bought a house there.  No problem.  Hey, Johnny.  Johnny.  Hey, Johnny.  No problem.  That would have been me.  I would have easily done that.  And I worked for a bunch of the mob guys at the golf course.  The country club.  Yeah, I was about to name the one.  At the country club.  That's all you got to say.  I think most of the guys are out of there now at this point, I think.  Out or, you know.  Huh?  Out of there, like what, prison or out of, like, the earth? 
[00:08:30]  It's been many years, but when I was a caddy, man, the mafia guys treated us the best.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  They treated us like human beings, and they gave us way more money than everyone else.  One thing you got to say about the mobsters, especially the old school guys, they sure knew how to tip.  Yes.  They sure knew how to tip.  Remember Jimmy in Goodfellas?  Come on.  Make him a drink.  He shoved his fucking money into everyone's pocket.  They had a pocket full of fucking dollars.  Shit.  Tens and hundreds.  Big bills.  Nice. 
[00:09:00]  The only time I had a problem with the mafia guys when I was caddying, not even a problem because I kept my mouth shut, was when I would get a foursome of mob guys.  Yeah.  Two definite mob guys because everyone just knew.  And the two guys they were going to kill after the game.  Well, you're onto something.  And then two guys that didn't speak English that they just picked up at the airport from Italy.  Oh.  There you go.  Why are they in town?  Well, it's the exchange program.  You take a couple of guys from Italy.  You send a couple of guys over to Italy. 
[00:09:30]  And it keeps things, you know, square.  They were so fucking scary.  Yeah.  It's like, why are they in town?  Big cigars and pinky rings.  Old school.  Old school.  Yeah.  Like the Sopranos.  And they couldn't even play golf.  So it's like, why are they even playing golf?  It was so shady.  It's the talk.  And they're playing golf.  They're standing there with the, like, the guy to have a golf ball in their hand.  Yeah.  And they kind of hold it up to their face.  Hey, you can do that thing.  Yeah, yeah.  You got, you can do that thing that I was talking about. 
[00:10:00]  You know.  There was a lot of Italian being talked.  Oh, yeah.  It was, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's.  That was the only time I was a little freaked out by the whole thing.  That was old school, though.  And then new school.  Now they were talking, like, the reason they got 127 of these guys and this whole investigation  and everything is, you know, there's no more code of omerta.  There's no more of that, you know, keep your mouth shut.  Everyone will rat pretty quick.  It's not really, it's not really pure Italian now, at least the lower end guys. 
[00:10:30]  The upper end guys are still your wops, your ginza loons.  But, you know, these guys will turn over pretty quick on each other.  But they're saying it's the biggest one in U.S. history.  Yeah, huge.  This article is saying one of, but I was reading earlier, it's the biggest.  Huge.  Why now, you know?  I guess they got a line on what was going on with these guys and.  You said there was an investigation going on for a while. 
[00:11:00]  Investigation has been going on for a while.  Yeah, it's obvious.  They don't get 127 guys in overnight investigation.  The FBI decided to go all in, though.  Yeah, this is like, let's take these guys in, break this thing up.  It was all, I think, they came from five crime families in the city.  127 guys from five crime families.  You go down the list to make sure a few of our guys are still safe.  Some guys, we maybe have heard their name over the years.  Maybe.  I love the middle names.  The middle names are my favoritest part ever. 
[00:11:30]  What, like the nose and.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, yeah.  Where is it?  Worcester to, is that Worcester?  Worcester.  Oh, I thought it was Worcester, New York.  Yeah, New York City.  They just busted them all up.  But yeah, I love the names.  Joey the Horse.  You know Joey goes, hey, hey, it's Nicky Velour.  Where are the real names?  And you know, one day he just walked in wearing a Velour shirt.  And I was like, hey, look at that Velour.  I mean, look at that Velour.  Yeah, do we have any of the real names? 
[00:12:00]  Open up the paper.  I want to hear some of the real names.  I'm sure we do.  That's fantastic.  Oh, a lot of Jets coverage in the paper today.  Oh, such names as, all right, Johnny Cash.  And, hey, no, they got Vinnie Carwash.  They did.  They fucking, you took that Vinnie Carwash.  You motherfucker.  The Daily News got the better names.  Ready?  All right.  You got Mush.  Mush.  They arrested Mush. 
[00:12:30]  But do you have, like, the first and last name?  Yeah, Andrew Mush Russo.  I love that.  That's what you got to hear.  No, you need the whole thing.  Andrew Mush.  Russo.  Russo got it.  Oh, Russo.  Hey, uh-oh, baby.  Oh, shit.  I can't believe they took him in.  They got the Mush.  Unbelievable.  They got the Mush.  You know, I'm going to have to give them the Jets game results this weekend.  I can't believe they got the Mush.  They got the Mush in the Mush mouth over here.  They got the Mush.  Who else did they get? 
[00:13:00]  Then you got Benjamin the Claw Castellazzo.  They got the Claw.  They got the Claw.  Son of a bitch.  They put the pinch on the Claw.  Get it?  Well, they got Jack the Whack, too, man.  Jack the Whack.  First name Jack, and then you go Jack the Whack.  Jack the Whack.  Son of a bitch.  And then his Italian name is way too much for me to even attempt to pronounce today.  Then you got Joseph Junior Lollipops. 
[00:13:30]  Karna.  Hey, Junior Lollipops.  How did he get that fucking name?  He would just be sucking on a lollipop as he's just hacksawing someone's arm off?  Hey.  Hey, what you doing over there?  Hey, lollipops.  I think we all love the mob.  I bet you even like the FBI guys are like, God, I can't believe I got to do this.  I love the mob.  Who doesn't love the names?  I love mob movies.  Come on.  Then you got Fat Larry.  Fuck, they got Fat Larry?  Fat Larry got pinched?  He got it.  Son of a bitch. 
[00:14:00]  You bastards.  Then they got Vito, Vito Love, Cartisiano.  Vito Love?  Cartisiano, yeah.  That's a pretty good name to get.  He must have been one of the ladies' men.  Also Johnny Pizza.  Johnny fucking pizza?  Johnny Pizza.  Son of a bitch.  Where are we going to meet?  I bet you he never ate a slice in his life.  That's why they called him that.  That's why it's tricky.  It's kind of a goof.  Yeah.  It's a goof.  Hey, hey, hey, you're Johnny Pizza.  But I never eat the pizza.  That's the way you bring the pizza.  That's why you're Johnny Pizza. 
[00:14:30]  Johnny Pizza.  They got Greg Stinky.  Was it Johnny Pizza Nagel, everyone's asking?  Yeah.  Which was leading to my bit.  Fuck.  Oh, shit.  Greg Stinky Sweats Hughes was pinched.  Greg Stinky Sweats.  No way.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  Let's see.  Who else we got?  Why am I Anthony Sweet 16 Kumiya?  Yeah, we need mob names.  We need mob names.  I know.  They got Jell-O, Ant.  Jell-O?  Fucking Jell-O. 
[00:15:00]  That must have been because of his belly.  Michael Jell-O Coutinho.  Something like that.  And, of course, you got a meatball.  Meatball?  Every mob bus, you got to get one meatball.  Put in your sausage, your meatballs, a little wine, some sugar.  Frank Meatball Bellantoni.  Ah.  Then you got Vinnie Car Wash.  You said that one.  Vinnie fucking Car Wash.  Where am I going to go now?  My Escalade's going to be filthy because they pinch Vinnie Car Wash.  Nighthawk.  Nighthawk?  Oh, boy.  Fuck, that's...

Let's say hi to Lou in New Jersey.  Lou.  Lou, hey, Mingy.  Talk to us, Lou.  Where are you?  Hey, Lou.  Yo.  What's up, Lou?  Lou.  You going to Jersey?  Yeah.  Well, you know, you guys bring up a little bit. 
[00:20:30]  You're supposed to say maybe?  About Gotti?  Yeah.  Yeah, huh?  You guys forgot about the interview you guys with Victoria Gotti, and you guys mentioned  when Gotti's kid was killed.  Oh, yeah.  They ran over his kid in the neighborhood.  Yeah, well, you just can't fuck with him in his neighborhood.  Yeah, if you're going to live in the Gotti neighborhood, you drive real slow and you  make sure you're looking around.  Exactly.  Yeah, but still, you call that a safe neighborhood?  Yeah, that's a really safe neighborhood.  As long as you don't fuck with him or run over any family members. 
[00:21:00]  Of course.  Mingy, Lou.  What are you doing?  They've missed him.  Missed him for David.  You're talking bad?  Hey, you're talking bad about the Gotti family, Lou?  I'm not talking bad about the Gotti family.  Why don't you stay with your fucking...  Why don't you stay with your Jersey people, Lou?  Huh?  Huh?  Don't bring me the gun.  See you, boys.  All right.  I mean, you've got to drive safe if you're in a Gotti neighborhood.  That's where you obey all speed laws.  Of course.  Stop signs.  Of course.  Oh, never speed through there. 
[00:21:30]  Drive around in a bubble wrap car.  Yes.  Yeah, ooh, did I hear you?  I'm sorry.  I have foam rubber and bubble wrap I'm driving around in.  No injuries, just a lot of pops.  So I don't just disappear.  Right.  All right, what's the PSA there, Ant?  I would assume it has something to do with another snowstorm that we're getting here in New York City today.  Yeah, we've got a little snowstorm.  Actually, it's a fast-moving storm.  You're dropping a lot of snow, but it's moving through the area fairly quickly.  And I'm glad you said it.  A little snowstorm.  Yeah.  You wouldn't know if you, you know, turned on the news this morning. 
[00:22:00]  No, no.  The thing is, it's during commuting hours.  The early morning commute is at its peak.  So it makes it a little rough for the drivers out there who should stay the fuck home.  But whatever.  Here's my PSA if you are going out on the road.  If you're a car and you do not have a four-wheel drive vehicle.  Now, look.  I'm not going to say, I'm not going to sit here on my high and mighty Escalade and say you shouldn't be driving on the roads.  I'm sure you've got to get to work.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  But physics are physics. 
[00:22:30]  Snow is snow.  Four-wheel drive is four-wheel drive.  Weight of vehicles are weight of vehicles.  It all comes into play.  If you're in a car right now, you're white-knuckling it, you're fucking, you're doing, you're doing your 20 miles an hour, whatever.  I understand.  I'm not even going to unload on you.  Nice.  But how about you get the fuck over to the right right now?  Get over the right.  And another thing.  A lot of people's windshield wipers, they ice a little bit and they streak your windshield a little. 
[00:23:00]  It's all right.  You can still drive through.  But you know what makes that just a little more difficult?  Hazard lights!  Look, you know something?  We know it's hazardous out there.  We don't need some dummy in a Corolla with his hazard lights on to inform, oh, I didn't know it was a hazard.  Safe to say everyone driving right now is in a hazardous situation.  So you don't have to make it obvious with your hazard lights. 
[00:23:30]  I saw three of them on the way in and wanted to fucking pit them.  I wanted to pit them right off the fucking road.  Get your hazards off!  What kind of people had their lights on?  Hispanics.  Hispanics?  In very small vehicles.  I would have never guessed Hispanics.  Yeah, that's what I saw.  I would have guessed Asian women.  No, no.  The ones I saw were Hispanics.  Because the soccer moms, they're just fucking animals in their minivans.  They were petrified.  They're not a hazard ever. 
[00:24:00]  Petrified and driving with hazard lights on.  Left lane.  Making a wall of cars that I was not able to go through.  I was doing 50 when there wasn't anyone in front of me.  Wasn't doing 80.  And you know me.  That number's good.  You'll do 80.  I love 80.  You'll do 80.  Love it.  But 50 is good.  Here's what you got to do.  You feather your gas up to 50.  You don't blast up to 50.  And you don't do 50 right behind people.  Because things can happen. 
[00:24:30]  Sure.  But if you have the road open.  And your lane is open.  And you're doing 50.  And you feather your gas.  You just back off a little.  And you tap your brakes a little.  If there's a curve coming up.  And then you feather your gas.  Back up again.  You're not going and spinning out.  And off the road you go.  There's a way to driving this shit.  And if you don't know how to do it.  Fine.  But get the fuck over to the right.  And let the people go. 
[00:25:00]  It took me so long to get into that shit.  You should teach a driving class.  I'm thinking.  The driver's test.  And this is part number two.  Right.  Should be so much harder.  And I've said this before.  It should include a fucking skid pad.  And it should include cones.  It shouldn't be like.  Oh could you parallel park?  Wow.  You're a champ.  Here's your license.  I love how they make you parallel park in some abandoned parking lot.  Without cars in front or behind you.  Yeah.  In a 50 foot spot.  Yeah.  Because that's what you do in real life.  Oh yeah. 
[00:25:30]  There's never a car in front or behind you.  There's never.  They don't have the pressure of a car like beeping as you're trying to parallel park.  It's just you in an empty parking lot practicing parallel parking in between two cones.  I'm not going to dwell on a gun issue here.  But we all know and I've said it before.  Guns are very hard to get.  Very hard to get licensed for.  Especially here in New York.  And they should be off the street.  We know your point.  Yeah.  Right.  No.  What?  They're just the licensing procedure.  Very, very, very hard.  Very hard.  But whatever.  Cars kill a lot more people every year than guns do. 
[00:26:00]  Yet the licensing process is a piece of fucking cake.  It's too easy.  You should have to drive in adverse conditions in order to get your driver's license.  If you can't, fucking welcome to public transportation, motherfuckers.  I don't care.  If you can't pass, go fuck your mother.  You're not fucking getting a license.  They should make it a lot more stringent.  Weather related, I want fucking, I want you driving through rain.  I want a course.  I want your county. 
[00:26:30]  Every county has to set up a course that has rain in it and some type of slippery condition.  What if your city's candid?  Do you have like a gunfire obstacle course?  Exactly.  That's the drive-by shooting course that you have to take.  It's just too easy to get a fucking license.  Yeah, I agree with you.  And people don't know, that absolutely don't know anything more than point your car in a direction and hit the gas pedal and step on the brake when something's in front of you. 
[00:27:00]  There's a lot more to driving.  There's a finesse to it.  And your car should be road ready.  Road ready.  Because all it takes where we live is one asshole to have a car break down and it ruins everyone's commute.  Road ready.  It should be road ready.  How do we do that?  I don't know because some people don't have the bucks for it.  So what are you going to do?  I understand that even.  No.  Well, a lot of times I've had a shitty car.  Have you had a car break down and fuck up everyone else's commute? 
[00:27:30]  Let me tell you this.  I've had a car break down, but you know what I do?  I get that fucker off the road really quickly.  I don't know how in moving traffic a car will stop and be just dead in the water in the middle lane of a three lane highway.  If you're moving and your car goes.  The first thing you should do is not try to restart it.  Look to your fucking right.  Check your mirrors and get the fuck coast off the road. 
[00:28:00]  Put it in neutral.  Whatever you got to do.  As best you can.  And coast off the road.  Don't sit there trying to restart it in the middle lane or step on the brake and stop.  And now assess your fuck problem.  You coast until you're off the road and clear of traffic.  But no.  You get these people.  And oh, I've seen them.  And they rarely look like you and I, Opie.  Rarely.  And they are stopped dead in the middle lane.  Now traffic is an issue.  I understand.  If you're stuck in traffic and your car stalls, you're stopped. 
[00:28:30]  That's a problem.  But you know what?  Get the fuck out.  Put it in neutral.  And start pushing, bitch.  Start pushing.  You could push most cars on a flat surface.  And if there's a traffic, if you're in traffic and a lot of people see you pushing your car,  they'll get out and help you push.  Yeah, because they want to get past you.  If you're just sitting there on your phone, bloody blah, I'm stuck in the middle.  Push.  I did it plenty of times when I was a kid. 
[00:29:00]  And my car stalled.  Get, fucking open that door.  Just start pushing.  The greatest idea ever was from Brian Regan.  And it's a joke.  But I really think they should do it.  Love Brian's.  He says they should get a big magnet.  A magnet.  And a helicopter.  Yes.  And man, you got a stalled car.  You just fucking pluck that magnet on the hood.  And get it the fuck out of there.  Like a wrecking yard.  Like, it's a great joke, but I'm thinking, it's 2011.  I think we could possibly do this now.  Yeah.  Helicopter, all the shit cars off the fucking road. 
[00:29:30]  It's one of those massive junkyard magnets.  Yeah.  The only time I think you should abso-fucking-lutely have a car that is in tip-top shape.  And if you don't, all right, we all, we've all had our moments.  But if you don't, you're not allowed to go into the tunnel.  I think if you stall in one of the tunnels in the city, you should be arrested.  It should be a crime.  It's a crime.  It should be a crime.  You entered the tunnel with a car that was not running properly. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Because the tunnel, Jim, oh, do you just want to fucking...  The fucking worst.  There's no easy way to get in the tunnel and get the car out.  They got to stop everybody and come in from the other direction.  They got to divert the cars behind the car.  It's just a fucking pain in the ass.  Yeah, but you know what?  Our ancestors sucked a dick.  Yeah.  Why didn't they make the tunnels wider?  So maybe there's some fucking room to push these cars to the side.  I think when fucking I Love Lucy cars were going through there, it was, you know, a little easier. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I guess.  Now, oh, and I take the tunnel every morning, and there are trucks that just will not fucking go to the right.  It says, trucks in right lane.  And it gives you the option when you go into the tunnel to go to the right or to the left.  And I have been behind trucks in the left lane of the tunnel just going, what happened?  Why are you doing this?  And you know why?  I know why.  Why?  You couldn't read the fucking sign.  Couldn't read that.  He doesn't know what that means.  It's not a fucking hieroglyphic like everything's got to be now because you don't fucking speak or read English. 
[00:31:00]  Everything's got to be in hieroglyphics.  I remember when the street signs, when the pedestrian signs actually said walk and then don't walk.  And then we had to make them different.  Is that why we changed that?  Yeah.  We had to have a little guy walk in and then the stop hand because people didn't understand English.  So we're catering to everybody else.  Yes.  We're catering to lazy.  Yes.  I remember ATM.  We didn't have to choose our language.  Ass to mouth?  Ass to mouth. 
[00:31:30]  You didn't have to choose your language.  You just got in there.  You got right in there.  You were speaking another language as you were doing it.  But imagine if you could speak Chinese, what you could get done with a pussy.  Oh, my God.  What do you have to do?  Holy shit.  Yeah, you're instantly speaking Greek when you do that.  Holy shit.  I might have to take up another language just so I could do that.  Imagine.  Your mouth moves in such a way when you speak Chinese, man.  That must feel good on a woman.  How come there's a stereotype that Asians aren't good lovers when they speak like that? 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  There's a lot going on.  There sure is.  What other language is good for eating pussy, you think?  I would think maybe one of those.  Italian is too smooth.  Yeah, but you do.  You have a lot of roll.  Like French.  French.  German's probably angry.  German's an angry fucking pussy eating.  You know what?  Some women like the angry pussy eating. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  So maybe they like a little German.  You're just yelling into her vagina.  Right.  Like it's one of Hitler's old microphones up at a podium.  Your fucking hair's in your face.  You're shaking your fist.  Look what we do.  We didn't even know we were doing this bit.  This is how great we are.  What language makes pussy eating better?  Who else is doing this type of radio for you?  Kevin from Connecticut.  Very geeky.  But he's saying Klingon.  Probably good.  Klingon?  Klingon.  There's Hitler.  Hitler must have been great with his little mustache, tickling the clit.  Yeah, he was made for eating pussy, if you think about it. 
[00:33:00]  If Hitler ate more pussy, chicks would have dug him more.  He got the mustache that he trimmed perfectly to fit around the clit.  Millions of lives might have been saved if Hitler just would have gone down on pussy  and had some chick really going crazy.  And you know there was some spit going on.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of spitting because he's just yelling.  And a lot of hard consonants.  Oh, my God.  A lot of hard German consonants.  And you know he just would fucking stick that angry hand right up her ass.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[00:33:30]  Wow.  This is just an amazing show.  And then when his hand started shaking, after a while he started getting that fucking Parkinson's.  Right.  He could just lay his hand on her clit.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Not even like work.  And preach on.  Speak nothing but the truth.  Thank you.  Yes.  As far as driving goes, you got to learn.  Wow.  Want to talk about parallel parking a semi.  Oh, wow.  See, that's got to do that.  A semi for the test.  You know what?  That's a good one.  That's what we all should have to do. 
[00:34:00]  Ooh.  If you could parallel park a semi, they give you your driver's license.  Attractor traffic.  Why not?  That's good.  Because backwards is forward, forwards is backwards with that steering wheel.  Because I remember when I took my driving test out there in the Huntington area, it was just a parking lot with a couple cones set up.  That's easy.  Nothing.  There should be a lot of pressure around you.  I drove around the neighborhood.  Like, I drove on very suburban streets.  It wasn't a parking lot.  It was actual streets, but never on to, like, Jericho Turnpike or a big road. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, no.  We did that, too.  But then the parallel parking, because they didn't want you bumping into real cars.  Right.  Because they didn't want to pay for that shit, so they set up a couple cones in a parking lot.  Yeah, that's what it was.  To end the fucking test.  They found, what they found with me was a street with no cars on it.  Okay.  And I was like, all right, just park, you know, park behind that hydrant.  And you're like, just as long as you don't hit the curb.  You know, we talk about it casually, but even though it was that easy, remember the panic?  The nerve.  It was nerve-wracking, because you wanted to pass so badly that you didn't want to fuck it up. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, I didn't want to be the asshole that I had to go back.  Because you told all your friends.  You were like, yeah, I'm going for my test today.  Right.  We'll have the car by Friday.  And then you've got to come back.  I failed.  I failed the written.  If you failed the written, just get the fuck out.  Fuck, I got my fucking, I got my license at 18.  I better not have failed.  It's a late bloomer with that shit, too.  Well, thanks, Andy.  He's a plow driver behind two cars going 15 miles an hour right now. 
[00:35:30]  Hit him!  Hit him!  But what about the plows going five miles an hour on the fucking turnpike?  I need to get around you!  Here's what I say about the plows.  Do they really have to go five miles an hour across the entire lane?  They're all lined up.  The conga line.  You need the conga line.  But five miles an hour, conga?  No, I've seen him go pretty fast.  Yeah, no.  Not today, though.  Today, here's what was happening also.  I was on the Grand Central Parkway.  And there was a plow.  And he's plowing.  He's doing his gig. 
[00:36:00]  And I had to sit behind cars that would not fucking pass the plow.  Would not go around him.  Go around him.  I'm not talking racing around him.  But just go a little faster.  Get around him.  And you're good.  But they won't fucking do it.  Get off the road.  I hate you.  What do you have to say to someone going slow right now in a Silverado?  You don't deserve the vehicle.  Get the fuck.  Take it back.  Get yourself a Prius.  And fucking only drive in the nice weather.  I saw a few four-wheel drive vehicles out there. 
[00:36:30]  And again, don't do 90.  Don't make any quick moves.  But when the road is open or you're the one blocking everything,  you could step it up.  Come on, motherfucker.  You got four-wheel drive.  It doesn't make you impervious.  In ice, it's very fucking dangerous.  But in this type of snow, move.  Let's go to the semi guy.  Another Anthony.  Jesus.  Anthony in New York.  Anthony on the radio.  A lot of Anthony's in jail today. 
[00:37:00]  Anthony semi.  Anthony's all over the place.  Anthony, what do you got?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  New York State requires that you have to parallel park a semi truck.  And it can't be more than 16 inches from the curb when you finish.  Or else you fail your test.  You can miss every gear on the road test.  But you have to parallel park a semi.  See, I think we all should have to do that.  Yeah.  That's a biggie.  Or at least a big vehicle. 
[00:37:30]  Something big.  Because you know what it is?  Parallel parking a semi fucks you up because you got to go backwards with the steering wheel.  Right, right.  Opposite direction, right?  You need like a school bus.  You should have to parallel park a fucking school bus.  How about you get to drive your car, but they hook up a boat.  A boat trailer?  A boat trailer.  And you got to back it down a slip.  No, that's too easy.  You now have to parallel park that mess.  Oh, parallel parking.  So you're in your car, which you're familiar with, but you got the fucking truck. 
[00:38:00]  That should be.  You should have to parallel park and then parallel park like that.  You're right.  You're right.  Yes.  Make it a little harder.  Thank you, Anthony.  Well, hey.  Oh, you got something else?  Go ahead, man.  Yeah.  Anthony was talking about the trucks in the left lane.  And the federal government's talking about electronically controlling our trucks no faster than 63 miles an hour.  So I just want you guys to think about the Long Island Expressway when you have nothing but a line of trucks in the right lane doing 63. 
[00:38:30]  And you guys can't get off your off ramp because we're not going to give you any space.  Yeah.  I fucking hate that idea.  That's a horrible fucking idea.  And if they are going to do that, why 63?  Why not pop it up to 70?  Because all these advocacy groups are saying that we're scary running the same speed as you guys.  It's not the tractor trailers.  It's the people that are incapable of driving near them, don't know about your guys' blind spots, have no idea how to pass a tractor trailer. 
[00:39:00]  I have sat behind cars in the rain, in the pouring rain, that have sat behind and next to a tractor trailer getting doused with rain.  Their visibility has to be zero.  Because they're afraid to pass the thing.  Meanwhile, they're in the most dangerous position ever.  And you're now stuck behind them in the second most dangerous position ever.  Pass the fucking thing and you won't have Niagara Falls on your windshield, you dumb fuck. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, and Anthony, about the speaking a language while you're eating pussy, I do speak German pretty well.  And I will have you know that I have a reproduction Waffen SS uniform that my old lady likes me to bag her while wearing.  Now, if you put that one on and start speaking German when you go down on her, that's probably a biggie.  That's a hell of a combination.  That's a biggie right there.  Yeah.  All right, my friend.  Have a good day, gentlemen, and a great show, both of you. 
[00:40:00]  Keep her between the ditches.  Thank you, Anthony.  Keep your shiny side up and your dirty side down, my friend.  Big 10 floor.  Bye.  Hey, do the Hebrews eat pussy?  No.  Because Al in New Jersey says Hebrew, good for eating pussy.  Yeah, man.  I've heard some Hebrew over the years.  Yeah.  Seems like if you speak Hebrew, you could get something done down there.  Yeah.  You got to slaughter the pussy the right way, though, or else you can't eat.  Isn't that how it's done?  Can you make it kosher?  Can you make the pussy kosher and then eat it? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  Well, it's got to be a Krause, a Krause pussy.  What about, no, a Hebrew national, Hebrew national pussy.  You're fucking with one of those hot dogs.  Let's head to the first break here.  Yes.  We got N word want to eat.  We got Debbie Gibson and Tiffany coming in today.  What fucking year is this?  Dude.  What year is this?  I know.  When I heard they were coming in. 
[00:41:00]  What year is this?  Really?  I need to know.  It is 2011.  Okay.  So this is 25 years too late.  Easily.  Well, if they were coming in to sing or to have like a battle of vocalists, which was  a big thing back when Debbie Gibson and Tiffany were out and about singing, it was one of  these big things like, oh, who's going to be the big one?  Yeah.  These two didn't get along, right?  No, it was, it was very competitive.  They were fighting for mall space.  Yeah.  Debbie Gibson was, uh, apparently they said Debbie was the better singer.  Tiffany was like the poppy kind of. 
[00:41:30]  No, Tiffany was the skank.  The skank.  It was kind of like when Britney Spears and, uh, and, uh, it was Britney and fucking, uh,  Christina Aguilera.  It was the same thing.  Although Christina Aguilera ended up having a much better voice than Britney Spears.  But she had a little skank too.  Same thing.  Tiffany had a little, a little of the skank and Debbie was wholesome.  Debbie was the wholesome one.  So you got to pick which one you really liked.  Right.  Depending on what you were into.  Exactly.  Uh, and if they were coming in for that, I'd be like, wow, what year is this?  But, uh, no, Opie, uh, when I saw what they were coming in for.  What are they coming in for? 
[00:42:00]  Well, it's something we've joked about so many times and Patrice actually had a hysterical  bit on it.  Um, they are doing a sci-fi original movie, a sci-fi original movie.  All right.  I like a little sci-fi.  Uh, yeah.  Well, their original movies, uh, you know, and Patrice brought up the point that it's like,  yeah, this guy, uh, walrus beaver, mega shark, like Patrice is like, whatever is going on 
[00:42:30]  in the movie, that's what they call it.  Uh, and that's what they're part of.  They're both, um, what's the name of the movie?  Uh, what is the name of the movie?  Do we have it here?  We're not prepared for the big, uh, the big, I had it on my, yeah, my email, my texty thing.  Uh, what is it?  They are promoting a fantastic film called Mega Python versus Gatoroid.  Mega Python versus Gatoroid. 
[00:43:00]  Gatoroid.  And here's, uh, what I get.  In the movie?  Yes.  Here's what I get from the plot.  One is an animal activist, the other, a park ranger.  And, uh, they're, they're at odds with each other.  And there is an obligatory, gratuitous chick fight between, uh, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany.  Man, our careers are really going downhill.  They are going downhill. 
[00:43:30]  I fucking can barely sit down.  I got a Gatoroid that is just pounding right now.  It's pounding.  I thought that was a drink.  Gatoroid.  Gatoroid's great.  It replaces your electrolytes.  Well, that's very exciting.  So that'll be a great interview.  Yes.  Hopefully they cancel.  Uh, the weather.  I was thinking, the first thing I thought when I woke up is, maybe they won't come in because  it's snowing.  Hopefully Debbie Gibson still lives on Long Island and she can't make it in.  Yeah.  Well, it's very snowy.  I can't do this. 
[00:44:00]  Gatoro.  Gatoro giveaway.  Yeah, we can do that, Danny.  All right.  I'll have a shot.  What?  Oh, oh, the giveaway.  The Gatoro giveaway is a little confusing.

Look, if you want to go to this thing and you know that the, the tour is coming close  to you, give us a call now and we'll figure it out.  Uh, we'll take a random caller for the, uh, the prize pack.  Okay?  All right.  The OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  On the ice roads of Alaska.  Oh, hey man, thank you so much for picking me up. 
[00:45:00]  If someone is playing a deadly game.  I gotta tell you, man, most people wouldn't have stopped for a stranger.  The good Lord puts different things in one's path every day.  What?  There's always things happening around me.  Ever since I was young.  Not good things, you know.  Oh, I'm scared.  Oh, I'm scared.  I'm scared of the dark, too.  But I go out there.  Prepare for the thrill ride of a lifetime.  We die!  40,000 Americans a year die on the highways of America. 
[00:45:30]  The trucker.  I'm the funniest guy I know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[00:46:00]  Well, the Jets songs are coming in.  Thank God, because I was saying, where are the Jets songs?  Because sports songs, probably my favorite thing on radio.  No, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  And we all know you can't win a Super Bowl without a song.  Without a team song, yeah.  So the Jets got some songs now.  We've got to pick one for the Jets, and then they can win the Super Bowl.  That's all we want. 
[00:46:30]  Basically, we've got to find the Super Bowl shuffle for the Jets.  Was that the biggest sports song ever, you think?  What do you think?  Let's Go Mets Go.  Oh, the biggest sports song.  Like sports song.  The biggest sports song ever.  How you doing?  Had to be Super Bowl shuffle.  A song that was actually made for a team has to be.  Gary Glitter, before they yanked that out of every stadium.  Well, yeah, but that was kind of generic.  Right.  That was a generic sports song.  And it wasn't even made for sports, but they adopted it, right? 
[00:47:00]  Are you talking about the Bears, the Super Bowl shuffle?  Yeah, that, oh my God.  Here's the real question.  No one would argue this is the greatest sports song ever for a team.  Made a video.  What was the second greatest?  Let's Go Mets Go?  I don't think we could come up with it as a majority.  Everyone knew this fucking song.  Everybody knew this one is right.  What was the second greatest?  And it was because also they had a video. 
[00:47:30]  And just seeing the fridge.  Sweetness.  Did you see Jimmy Fallon?  No.  He did a remake of this.  Really?  Yeah.  Based on, you know, all current players going to the Pro Bowl, I think.  Really funny.  Really good job.  I didn't see that one.  And it looks almost exactly like the original video.  Kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah, because wasn't it just in like a room or something?  Oh, yeah.  A white room.  Oh, yeah, with a dumb screen behind him.  Dancing around like idiots. 
[00:48:00]  All right, we don't need to hear the Super Bowl shuffle because we got brand new jet songs.  Got the big game against the Steelers.  It's going to be a tough game.  You know what I want?  A Pop-Tart.  Fuck yeah, get me one too, man.  How about Pop-Tarts for everyone?  The cinnamon ones?  Fuck yeah, that's what I want too.  Post it up.  Oh.  Or do you want to go Entenmann's Crump Cake today?  Oh, I'm into just fucking pigging today.  Can you get us a, you know what an original fucking crump cake is? 
[00:48:30]  Entenmann's?  Don't get fancy.  You don't like the apple crumb though?  No, they try to go fancy.  I understand.  I need basic Entenmann's fucking crump cake.  Look, I'm with you on this.  Not double crumb.  Right.  Not, didn't they fucking drizzle some chocolate over the top?  I don't need any of that.  Just a basic fucking original Entenmann's Crump Cake.  No.  Because it's a snow day today.  Do you like the little mini crumb cakes?  Those round ones that are in the-  Drake's?  Yeah, Drake's.  What's the matter, Iraq?  Iraq's fucking shitting his pants.  He is looking like, oh my God. 
[00:49:00]  You made a face like, oh, this is the best conversation I've ever heard.  It is, but I was stretching.  Iraq just came.  You're forgetting the Entenmann's Crump Cake Donuts that they make.  No.  See, they're fancy and all that shit up.  That's a little different.  It's great.  Believe me.  You just need to go original.  I'm telling you.  That shit's great.  That's all you need.  But I am so into that fucking crumb cake.  It's so good.  You're all right.  But the Entenmann's Crump Cake, regular.  Yeah, it's the best.  But also, apple crumb cake.  I'm not going to fucking diss that, yo.  I don't know if I had that. 
[00:49:30]  It's good shit.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's apple inside a crumb cake.  Fuck.  That's great.  Oh, shit.  Maybe we should try that.  It is good, but yeah, crumb cake.  I hate all of it.  It is really sweet.  I was going to say, let's ask Iraq, but he jumped in.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  You know what's good also?  I like a good apple turnover, as long as there's enough apple in there.  But sometimes you bite it, and it's like a cave in there.  Yeah.  It's like you're splunking.  Yeah.  There's a cave and no apple.  It tastes like layers of skin.  Yeah, it peels off. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know what layers of skin.  Like leprosy.  Look, folks, I'm trying.  I don't know what layers of skin taste like, but it's the consistency.  It all just falls apart in layers.  It kind of falls apart.  It's not a neat thing to eat, but they are.  They're delicious.  Are we working on our food porn bit?  You've got to throw Iraq in there, too.  Iraq and Roland will be the stars of our food porn bit.  Food porn.  Does he know how to get in a man's fucking cream cake original?  I'm going to go get him.  Oh, you're going to go?  Oh, shit.  I have confidence in Travis. 
[00:50:30]  I'm not going to do this shit, motherfucker.  Although you failed at the Whopper bar yesterday.  I didn't fail at the Whopper bar.  The Whopper bar failed me.  Whopper bar failed us.  Yeah, because they don't make the New York pizza burger anymore.  And they don't even make Whoppers until what time?  Not 1030.  Their grill wasn't.  If the name of your business is called Whopper bar, you should be making Whoppers at six  in the morning.  Exactly.  I was the only one in there.  There's no last call at the Whopper bar.  There was no one in there?  No one was there.  Another bad business idea by Times Square?  Yeah, because they're fucking all bedridden. 
[00:51:00]  They can't get out of bed.  They've got to tear down a wall to get into the place.  Get it there, fat.  Oh, I see.  Aw.  Yikes.  So we want Edelman's Crumb Cake?  Original.  Like the big one.  Just original.  Right.  Not double crumb, not with the drizzle on top.  Nah, nah.  What else are they doing with that shit?  Regular Crumb Cake.  Oh, here's what else.  Do you heat it up at all?  Wow, I've never...  No, I just eat it regular.  But I've heard, heat it up just a tad.  15 seconds in the microwave.  Not even nuked.  You need toaster oven heat.  I ain't fucking toaster oven. 
[00:51:30]  It's old school, my friend.  Just get us the...  Whoa.  No, see that?  No, we don't want it.  That's ultimate.  That's exactly what we...  I don't want a regular Crumb Cake.  They fucked it up.  All you need is a...  See that?  Crumb Coffee Cake.  Crumb Coffee Cake.  That's it.  Crumb Coffee Cake.  That's all you need.  You don't need the fucking ultimate.  That's a pound cake.  What?  What the fuck is that?  Oh, okay.  All right, all right.  But it says...  No, it's labeled pound cake, but that's the box.  Do you want the chocolate chip Crumb Cake?  Look, it says Crumb Cake.  No!  That's what we're trying to tell you.  For the love of God! 
[00:52:00]  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  They're fucking with something that's really good.  The original is all you need.  I'm telling you.  You don't need...  By breaking the balls, it doesn't matter what you're getting fucking fished.  You don't need ultimate.  You don't need the double.  You don't need the chocolate chip.  That's chocolate chip.  There you go.  There ends up being like coffee where you can't find the original anymore.  Find the one that just says like...  If you can't find the original, we're going Pop-Tarts.  Simple as that.  That's a completely different thing.  Entenmann's Crumb Cake.  That's it.  There it is.  It's right there.  Danny?  No, that's not the one.  No, it's labeled the ultimate.  It's not the one.  Go to the third one, and let me just look and see what that says on the bottom. 
[00:52:30]  It says Crumb Coffee Cake.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  It's labeled wrong.  It says...  Not the box, the picture, but the label for the picture.  Right.  Go back one.  Yeah, yeah.  It says pound cake.  That's bullshit.  I thought that there was a crumb cake that's not coffee.  No, no.  It's coffee cake.  It's actually crumb cake.  It's also called coffee cake.  It's not coffee tasting.  I'm confused.  It's basically...  They're basically saying, if you're having coffee, you better have this too.  It's a perfect compliment. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  Yeah, that's the one right there.  Entenmann's Crumb Coffee Cake.  Crumb Coffee Cake.  And it doesn't taste like coffee, so that's a little deceiving.  Crumb Coffee Cake.  It should just say Crumb Cake.  We want some Crumb Cake.  Crumb Cake.  Why do you need to be there, really?  I know.  Why do we have to fancy everything up?  C-R-U-M is crumb.  Crumb.  Crumb.  I don't need crumb.  Iraq would like to comment.  Another good suggestion?  Yes.  They make an excellent raspberry strudel.  Yeah, they do.  I'll give it to Eric.  They do make a good raspberry strudel. 
[00:53:30]  I thought when he said another good suggestion, he was going to say, I quit.  Wait, raspberry what?  Raspberry strudel.  No.  That's very sweet.  I bet it's good.  You can only eat a little bit of it because it's very rich, but it's delicious.  Put it this way.  I bet I could polish off that whole Crumb Cake.  Oh, yeah.  Like the sweetness wouldn't get to you.  It's not like a Cinnabon where it's like when you smell it and you're like, oh, and you  get it and then you take one bite and it's like, this is so good.  You take the second bite and you're ready to puke.  Do you eat it in rows? 
[00:54:00]  I'm a square.  I'm a square guy.  Oh, I go right for a row.  An entire row?  Slice right down.  Yes.  But a big square.  There it is right there.  I go for like a quarter of the cake.  Look how good that looks.  Crumb Coffee Cake.  Oh, and check the date because it's got to be spongy.  It's got to be soft.  Yeah, I get the best date possible.  Can't be sitting in a bodega for fucking three months.  I'm going to go down to Dwayne Reed.  Dwayne Reed has coffee cake?  Dwayne Reed has everything.  Dwayne Reed is like the grocery store for Dwayne Reed.  I know, I know, I know.  All right, so let's make a backup plan here.  If they don't have that, what kind of Pop-Tarts am I getting? 
[00:54:30]  No, we got them.  Oh, we have Pop-Tarts.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, yeah.  Got that.  All right, how long do you think this is going to take?  Because now I'm so into it.  JD is suggesting Entenmann's French Crumb Cake.  No!  God, gee!  Kevin from Connecticut is suggesting you don't nagle this up.  Wait, did you say?  What did you say?  I said a French...  Out of nowhere, a nagle appears. 
[00:55:00]  The show swerves to avoid it, but there's no hope.  A nagle is just too big and has made too many mistakes.  The hosts scramble to get a hold of the situation.  Ah, do we have a hold of it?  No French, no fucking chocolate drizzle.  No ultimate.  No fruit, no ultimate.  It's the same one that my parents brought to their friend's house when we used to go  to Flushing to visit back in 69.  Ah, crumb donuts.  I ate this shit when the Vietnam War was going, and I want the same cake now! 
[00:55:30]  Eric shakes his head, yeah.  Did you ever go to the Entenmann's factory when growing up on Long Island?  No.  Yes.  Did you go to the Entenmann's factory?  I lived near it in Brentwood.  Was that like fucking Disney for you?  You'd walk out your house on the weekends, and you could smell the bakery in a five-mile  radius.  It was awesome.  Wow.  I forgot all about this until right now.  We used to take a little field trip to the Entenmann's fucking factory.  Places.  Because men, I yell at the Voss, but my mom always was hunting for a bargain. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, really?  And you could get a bargain at the factory.  Yeah, we would drive an hour just to save 10 cents on a fucking loaf of bread.  Those are fucking so good.  Now, that's the eight Devil's Food Crumb Donuts.  That is the shit.  Now, in a donut form, I will accept variations of the cake of crumb, but in a crumb cake,  it's got to be a crumb cake, but Devil's Food Crumb Donuts are the shit.  They are definitely the shit.  We are talking like women on their period right now.  What's wrong with us?  Women on our periods! 
[00:56:30]  It's a snow day, you know.  It is a snow day, and I'm treating it as such by eating.  Oh, it goes right to my thighs.  I'm going to get a raspberry strudel from me and sex bag.  Are you going to get that?  What are you eating, though?  You think you're going to get a piece of that?  Watch a fucking, watch some footage of a lion and a hyena.  And that's exactly, like fighting over a fucking zebra carcass.  You're going to be the hyena.  You don't think Eric's going to share?  Just jumping in, and have to run back out because the lion goes to bite your head off.  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Entenmann's Chocolate Donuts.  Entenmann's is delicious.  Okay, the chocolate donut.  Oh, my God.  You can come back with those if you don't have the fucking...  Yeah, yeah, come back with those, too.  If you don't have the coffee cake, when they crack...  Oh, my God.  I just remembered how good those are.  When you hear the crack of the chocolate when you bite into that shit...  Oh, God damn it.  All right.  Write that down.  Get the donuts, too.  Or even the small ones, the big box of just the tiny chocolate donuts.  Mini bites.  The problems.  Yeah.  Is there a dessert you don't know about?  I'm an expert.  Yes, you are.  Jeez. 
[00:57:30]  We've got to put the chocolate ones in the fridge so that we can harden up the chocolate.  So they crack, yeah.  Except they're not melting.  We'll have those a little later.  Can I ask you, Rock, what is in your cupboards right now as far as, like, treats go?  My cupboards.  There is...  There are some Rice Krispie treats.  Now, are they store-bought or freshly made?  Store-bought.  Store-bought.  Yeah.  Individually wrapped?  That's an addiction right there.  Yeah.  Because they never taste as good as making them.  No, they don't.  Go ahead.  There's that.  There's the Orville Redenbacher Movie Theater Buttered Popcorn. 
[00:58:00]  It's got to be the buttered.  That's the thought you just have popcorn and, you know, maybe put a little salt on it.  Popcorn and salt, that's fine for me.  Cheese nips.  Cheese nips.  I love those.  Spread a little fucking cheese whiz on a girl's nipple.  No.  Cheese nips.  I hate those.  They're delicious.  What else?  Snyder's Sourdough Pretzels. 
[00:58:30]  Those are my favorite.  Really?  What do you put on them?  Yeah.  Nothing.  What do you dip them in?  No, you just eat them right out of the box.  Yeah.  He just eats the box.  Mmm.  It's biodegradable.  Any steak martinis?  Oh, he's like, oh, I wish.  Oh, I wish.  Fucking BAB.  I don't know.  I don't know what was going on there.  But they had Snyder's, Snyder's, Snyder's Pretzels.  Yes, Snyder's Pretzels.  In the basement.  Pallets and pallets full of boxes of, I don't know what I'm buying. 
[00:59:00]  Must have been a trade.  That's what I'm thinking.  Fucking some pretzelola.  To this day, I don't like them because of that.  I ate them every night.  That happened to me with wheat thins.  Really?  I had to live on wheat thins in my little fucking shit apartment.  It wasn't even an apartment.  I had a room for rent upstairs and a house right across from the Green Lawn train station.  Wait.  I want to go local.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  It was right on that street just to the, I think it was to the south of the train tracks.  Wow. 
[00:59:30]  The big parking lot and then a row of houses on that street.  I was upstairs there.  And I had a hot plate and then I had like a coffee pot with the little metal thing on  the bottom that would heat up.  You plugged in the coffee pot.  Never made coffee in it, but I would pour like water and ramen noodles in there.  Macaroni cheese too, right?  Yeah.  And then I would be too lazy to clean it.  So it would just crust up and I'd throw it away.  Start over.  And just hot plate it again.  And there was a point where I think for a month straight, all I ate was wheat thins and 
[01:00:00]  I'd break into the guy's room next to me because it was a two-bedroom thing upstairs.  I'd break in his room when I saw he was gone because his bicycle was in the hallway.  And when his bicycle was gone, he was gone.  And I'd break in and steal his fucking, his cookies.  How the fuck did we?  And he had Hydrox.  It wasn't even fucking Oreos.  Hydrox.  He had Hydrox cookies, not Oreos.  But I was starving.  And then I would, I would take like five of them and then I would spread each cookie  out a little bit.  So you can tell.  So it was still the same length of cookie, but there was a gap between each cookie. 
[01:00:30]  Hydrox was the poor man's Oreo.  Yes, they stunk.  Hydrox sucked.  They used to have Hydrox.  I came from a Hydrox powdered milk family.  You were a Hydrox family?  Ah, poor thing.  Powdered milk.  Dude, how the fuck did we do so well, man?  We were both fucking poor.  Fucking white trash.  Dirt fucking poor.  I never did the noodles though.  I got lucky.  Ramen noodles were king.  I loved ramen noodles.  I did.  I would still eat the shit out of ramen noodles.  I was the, I was the Chef Boyardee kid. 
[01:01:00]  Really?  I went Chef Boyardee.  Ah.  No, Chef Boyardee was a little too fucking new.  To this day, I'll eat that.  Really?  Every once in a while, I'll go old school and I'll go, you know what?  I want a, I want a kid of Chef Boyardee fucking raviolis.  Yes.  I like that broth in the fucking ramen noodles.  You sprinkle that beefy broth on there.  I don't think I ever ate that.  I was like, what do you eat?  It's like, I'm eating ramen noodles.  It's like, what are you eating?  I'm like, I eat ramen noodles.  And they're like, oh, he's still here.  Why is Travis still here? 
[01:01:30]  Travis!  Go!  I'll be back with treats.  God damn fucking lazy.  I love how Travis has to go get treats.  It would have been an intern, Travis.  Yeah, remember the old days?  Just so you guys know, if you're interested in ramen noodle facts like I am.  Ramen noodle fact.  In an average ramen noodle package, you have more than 170 feet of noodle.  170 feet you consume?  Yeah.  That is good.  Of ramen noodle.  And I was always like fucking impatient.  So I wouldn't cook it long enough and they'd be al dente. 
[01:02:00]  It'd be a little hard.  You'd get a crunchy noodle.  Oh, nothing worse.  Yeah, I hate that.  But I was hungry.  I was starving.  It's better than like forgetting them in the pot.  And then like you forget for 10 or 15 minutes.  Then you come back and there's no more water.  It's just these huge, thick ramen noodles.  Noodles and you just sprinkle the shit on it.  Dude.  Eating paste.  I've seen Ziggy.  I've never seen anyone do this before.  They wanted a snack.  He said he's going to have some ramen noodles.  And Ziggy opened up ramen noodles.  And then he opened up the flavoring packet and just started sprinkling the flavoring onto the ramen noodles.  Onto the brick.  And started eating it like a cracker. 
[01:02:30]  Does it taste good?  I don't know.  I didn't try that shit.  I think I might have to try that.  I don't want that at all.  That's fucked up.  No, I want them ramen noodles soupy.  I want soupy.  All right.  So it leads to the Jets songs.  Or the Jets songs.  Jets songs.  By the way, no one came up with the second greatest sports song for a team.  That's how great that Super Bowl shuffle was back in its time.  Huge.  No one ever came up with another song.  Think of the big teams.  They come up with something in the day for like San Francisco. 
[01:03:00]  I can't even name another.  Steelers.  Another sports song.  No.  Cowboys.  Cowboys ever have something?  Can't think, man.  I don't know.  There's got to be one that we're missing.  So you want to.  Hmm.  I got three songs that we got to listen to.  Three Jets songs.  Working our way.  Working ourselves up for this big Sunday.  Go.  Give me a number from one to three.  By the way, John Montone was in. 
[01:03:30]  You heard that?  Yeah.  I heard that too.  He was in Pittsburgh.  I'm here in Pittsburgh looking for Jets fans.  Why was he in Pittsburgh?  I'm here in Pittsburgh.  He should just have a Foley sound guy.  He doesn't have to be there.  A horse is running next to me.  We got to get him back on the show.  I love John Montone.  Let's talk to him on a walk.  I'm here.  All right.  Number two.  All right.  Number two.  Number two. 
[01:04:00]  Sam's got to be in here because one of the Jets songs is by one of his favorite fucking DJs.  Oh, Christ.  Number two you want, huh?  Yeah.  Is that a good one?  All right.  Or do we pick?  Oh, no.  These are Jets songs.  Did I just make an error?  There's a lot of people trying to make Jets songs.  Hi, Sam.  The three we got in front of us are songs that are getting a little publicity out there.  Sam's spoiled as far as cake goes.  Why is it?  Because I get homemade.  Because your mom. 
[01:04:30]  Your mom makes homemade shit.  Whoa.  Where's our fucking apple pie?  Exactly.  And our key lime pie.  She said she'd make it over the weekend.  I said that wasn't good enough.  Remember?  Right.  But then you also control her life.  I said blow off your lunch date.  Then you played the F&C sound clip for her, which she didn't appreciate.  Fucking cake it meant.  No.  Oh, I thought C was cake.  That was supposed to be a motivator, Sam.  No, that doesn't.  She hasn't responded well.  That was a motivator.  Negative reinforcement.  So when do we get it?  I'll see what I can do over the weekend. 
[01:05:00]  And is it going to be key lime and apple or just apple?  Well, I want apple.  I don't want to be fucking shut out of this thing.  Right.  The fact that it's been days now, you'd think there'd be two pies.  You would think.  So you're down on your mom, too.  Well, I mean.  That sounded disgusting.  Yeah.  That's.  If she doesn't make two pies, it's not cool.  Yeah.  Because it's been days.  All right.  Good.  It's like if it was.  If you wanted it the next day, I could see where she's like, well, I can only make one  pie.  But it's been like three days.  You've had her apple pie? 
[01:05:30]  No, I don't eat pie.  Jesus.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  He doesn't eat pie.  His mother bakes like a slave.  She's a great baker.  And you don't fucking.  The Hulkster.  I'm distracted.  He's so distracted right now.  The Hulk is on TV for some reason.  Why?  Hold on.  He's now taking those things from the wrestling ring to the football field.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Why?  I can tell you.  You know what I mean?  No.  It wasn't the fact that.  Mark Scott.  We played as a wrestler.  Hulk Hogan. 
[01:06:00]  What I took from him.  Hulk Hogan.  He was.  Yeah.  He got his kind of delivery from watching wrestling.  He's a big wrestling fan.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, okay.  Because everyone was talking about the rant he had after the Pats win.  Yeah.  Everybody called it a rant.  I called it a promo.  The win over Pats.  Rent a center, brother.  Yeah, he kind of promo.  Rent a center, brother.  That's a great follow.  Is he doing well?  Yeah.  Rent a center.  I hope my wife doesn't take this money, brother.  He did an A&E biography documentary type thing where he was talking about how he was swallowing 
[01:06:30]  a ton of pills and had a gun in his mouth right before he came back.  How do you do both of those?  Well, first he swallowed the pills.  Why not just put the pill in the barrel and shoot it down your throat?  Yeah, why do you make delivery?  Why go pills if you got gun?  Hitler did that.  He went pills?  Bit the cyanide and fucking shot himself in the head.  But he was just taking volumes and stuff.  Just being efficient.  Just being efficient.  I feel bad for Hulk.  Why?  He's a Hulkster.  I mean, he's still back on top of things in TNA.  Rent a center commercials.  He's got to be raking in fucking in the fucking tens of thousands. 
[01:07:00]  I feel bad.  He can rent all the furniture he wants.  Yeah.  That's a hookup.  And then if his wife takes it, she's got to pay the rent on it.  That was rented.  All right, Jets songs.  We got three that are getting attention out there.  A lot of people trying to come up with a big song that everyone plays on the radio.  What you going to do when you can't pay for your rented table?  Ah, Linda, that table was rented and you took it.  Linda and her 19-year-old boyfriend. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, poor her.  Getting the shit fucked out of her by a 19-year-old instead of Hulk's fucking tits on top of her.  Oh, my God.  Those are pectoral muscles.  Yeah, they used to be.  They're fucking full-fledged tits now.  What about his 24-inch python?  Whatever.  Python's my ass.  His pecs are now two handbags.  Oh.  Poor Hulk.  Feel free.  Poor Hulk.  Here's the first Jet song.  Will this be the big song? 
[01:08:00]  I don't know.  Was that not Jet football or was that not Jet football?  Woo-hoo!  Hut, hut, hike, hike!  Jet up!  Here we go, baby.  No question about it.  Jet up!  This is for the night of the night.  Stay on gang green.  And there was many.  Like a wreck's machine.  That's being a jackass.  Jet up!  Can we not run the ball?  Jet up!  Down their throats every snap.  Defense they mean.  Get on up!  Like a wreck's machine.  Can we not throw it any time we want to throw it?  Jet up!  You can be a world champion.  Pittsburgh's the scene.  Get on up!  Like a wreck's machine. 
[01:08:30]  When are we going to put it together?  Wait a minute!  Can't wait!  Bart Scott!  Anybody watching me, Pete!  Spend your arm!  Feel great.  Poetic justice.  Jet up!  We're a good football team.  Jet up!  They can't stop a nose leak.  Jet up!  Let's make sure we play like the New York Jets.  Fellas, I think it's time to go to Pittsburgh and eat a snack.  Should we go eat a snack?  Yeah!  I said, should we go eat a snack?  Yeah!  Break it down!  Let's go to eat a goddamn snack.  Um...  I'm going to refer to the paper. 
[01:09:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Jim Kerr, morning show on Q104 yesterday, broke out Like a Rex Machine, which is indeed  based on the famous James Brown song.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And samples, press conference quotes from Jets coach Rex Ryan.  Wait, wait.  Are you reading from a newspaper?  Yeah.  The newspaper thought, that song was so goddamn good, we got to write about it.  There's barely even any writing.  There's no lyrics.  And I think Jim Kerr is the guy that gives, uh, definitely me and maybe everyone else 
[01:09:30]  really dirty looks when he walks by every day.  He's another one of those guys.  I don't even know what we've ever done to the fucking guy.  Existed.  We existed.  I think old school radio guys just fucking hate us for some reason.  We don't play the hits.  But why are they talking about this?  Yeah, we don't play the hits.  In all fairness, now he has a reason to hate us.  This song is horrible.  And why is the paper writing about it?  Why are you shitting on his parade?  He made it so you got some press today.  Good for him. 
[01:10:00]  I'm sure he works hard, but, you know, enough with the dirty looks.  I don't even know what I did to you.  All right.  Well, there's the first one, Ant.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that was, uh...  How many stars did you give that?  I'm going to have to base it on, um, the other songs, but...  See, this is something I never understood about the Gong Show, either, if I could bring  this up, because we're going to rate these songs.  Uh, you remember the first act that would come out and someone would give them a score  of 10?  Yeah, then it fucks up. 
[01:10:30]  You never give the first guy out a 10, even if they're the most amazing thing you ever  saw.  It fucks it up for everybody else.  You give them, like, an 8.  But judges know that, and then they lowball the first guy always to give room to get higher  scores, so that's fucked up, too.  But just like that, but that's what you're supposed to do.  Lowball the good guy.  What if the first guy is the best ever, but you're lowballing so you have room to work  with when the rest of the contestants come out?  Then you give everyone else a 7 or a 6.  You never give a 10 to the first guy. 
[01:11:00]  You can't get more 10-er.  Our scores go to 11.  11, 11, 11, across the board.  You never give the first guy a 10.  So I'm thinking of that, and how many stars system are we working here?  Let's go movies.  Movies?  Five star?  Four.  Four star?  Four star, right?  Four star?  Four star.  Okay.  If we're working on four stars, can we give half stars?  I'll give that.  Like the Ashton Kutcher movie's getting?  Like three and a half stars?  Yeah.  The Ashton Kutcher movie's getting a half a star.  Wow.  Not bad. 
[01:11:30]  Yes, it is.  Not bad, Ashton.  Okay.  If we could give half stars, I'm giving the Jim Kerr song one star.  One star.  Knowing I could go lower if you just put a big handful of dog shit.  If you took dog shit and took a handful of it, Obi, and threw it into the CD player and  then smooshed it shut and brown stinky dog shit just squeezed out of the side and you  hit play.  But the paper-  I'd give that more.  But the paper wrote about it. 
[01:12:00]  You'd give that more.  Yes.  Like a star and a half, maybe.  Star and a half.  Wow.  Oh, you thought I was going to go lower.  Yeah, I thought I'm not better.  The great David Hinckley talked about it in his column today.  Speaking of dog shit.  The great David Hinckley.  All right, we got two more left.  Uh-huh.  Right hand or left hand?  Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.  Catch a-  Oh.  Oh.  Stone.  Well, that's how I learned it.  I know, but it's not culturally.  All righty.  Uh, left. 
[01:12:30]  Sam's favorite DJ came up with a song.  Yes.  From E.C. Moe.  Remember Chunky?  Of course I do.  Motherfucking Chunky!  Chunky's-  Every night on 92.3 now.  Oh, shit!  Chunky.  Now, 92.3 was our old station and they got rid of us for the likes of Chunky and who  else?  I forgot the names right.  I'm whack-thony tonight.  Wow.  There's, of course, Tic Tac and the Freak Show.  Tic Tac and the Freak Show.  Where they get crazy.  That's right.  It's a freak show.  Lisa Page.  Lisa Page.  And, of course-  She's wild.  What do we do every morning?  We roll with Nick Cannon.  That's right.  Roll with Nick Cannon. 
[01:13:00]  Get the job done in the morning.  That's right, he is.  Catch a tiger by the toe.  What?  That's the-  Yeah, catch a tiger.  What is that?  That's what it is now.  No!  It always-  Yeah.  It's catching-  No, no, it's tiger.  I always remember, eenie-meenie, when we would pick, uh, you know, choose for sides  and things like that.  At least from, like, 86 on, it's been tiger, for sure.  Well, I never heard fight, fight, a tiger and a wife.  Well, I didn't-  It doesn't replace everything, but in this scenario, you guys.  Well, in my house, I like sticking and kicking it old school. 
[01:13:30]  You're a traditionalist.  I am very traditionalist.  You know what I hated about the fight, fight, a blank, and a wife there?  What?  You didn't get to sing the song often.  No.  No.  It was like, fight, fight, and it's over.  Well, but, I mean, you never had that combo, is what I'm saying.  Did you ever hear-  When you were privileged, like we were, and got to go to school in white schools.  Yeah.  You didn't get that so much.  Did you ever hear about fight, fight, slave, and a wife, and then it's, if the slave starts  to win, we all jump in?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, that's how we-  Yeah, yeah, that's how we know. 
[01:14:00]  I'm just changing it like the, uh, the books.  Right.  Like the, uh, Huck Finn.  PC.  PC.  PC.  I PC'd it up without having to use tiger.  We're going Huck Finn on the show.  Yeah.  Nice.  About the Huck.  It's about time.  Uh, Chunky, you're, you love the Chunk, huh?  I love Chunky.  I've met him in person.  Fight, fight, it's a hate crime.  Fight, fight, yeah, it's a hate crime.  That's funny.  That's good.  Uh, Chunky.  He's a great guy, but the only thing that makes him better than, he's a great guy, he's  an even better DJ.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Coming from you, that means nothing. 
[01:14:30]  Anthony, I go back to the paper.  Because I'm disingenuous.  I go back to the paper.  Yeah, disingenuous.  Back to, uh, David Hinckley's column.  David Hinckley's column.  Wow.  Two city radio stations have offered fight songs for the Jets in their AFC title game  against the Steelers.  Chunky, evening host on K-Rock.  Yeah.  Is it still K-Rock?  Is it still K-Rock?  No, it's 923 now.  Did he say K-Rock?  I did.  Oh, I thought he put it.  I know.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I did, because I can't let it go.  It's now. 
[01:15:00]  That's yesterday.  Evening host on K-Rock does a full-length rap called J-E-T-S.  He gives props to Wiz Khalifa.  Actual propeller.  Yeah, that's their guy who does the other sports songs, like the Yankees song and stuff  on 92.3 now.  Whose black and yellow is the musical template for this song.  So, this song, good enough to make the paper, according to David Hinckley.  Let's take a listen to Chunky's song.  And, by the way, where this beats Jim Kerr's song, this is Chunky actually on the track.  Oh, shit. 
[01:15:30]  He's rapping.  He does the song.  Chunky raps?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is.  J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S.  Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is.  J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S.  Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is.  What about us white fans?  I know, they're all rap songs.  What about us white fans?  Fuck.  Fight song.  How about something by REO Speedwagon?  Not now. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, like riding the storm out.  Jets are riding the storm.  Riding the storm out.  Ugh.  Riding the wrecks out.  Yeah.  You got to throw wrecks in there, though.  We need something more melodic that white people can appreciate.  This rap stuff, ooh, it makes me nervous, Sam.  I know, it's new.  Maybe we could go with some kind of Marshall Tucker track.  Marshall Tucker?  Yeah.  Can't you see? 
[01:16:30]  Gonna take a freight train all the way to Pittsburgh.  I don't care about them.  And then it could be a flute solo.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's got it.  He's got it.  That is actually the fucking flute solo.  He's got a flute solo.  You don't know your fucking rock. 
[01:17:00]  Gonna take a freight train down to the station load.  Don't care where it goes.  Hear that, David Hinckley?  That's Opie and Anthony's Super Bowl Jet song.  Yeah, David Hinckley.  How about some ink?  Yeah.  Yeah, can you throw a copy toward him?  I will.  We'll be in tomorrow's paper.  Oh, well.  Certainly, well.  We'll be saying J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S.  Rex Ryan guaranteed himself a ring.  Like J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S, J-E-T-S. 
[01:17:30]  White helmet, green paint.  I hear they scared of us, but the point's ain't.  Soon as we hit the field, look at the deep space.  I've got a blind man, yeah, they make the tour shade.  The crowd's inside, and the fans are warring to real need this.  You know what we pay for it, and we got the pedal pushed down.  Holy shit.  What is he saying?  He's talking mad shit.  Is he talking mad shit?  Yes.  I didn't know this was mad shit. 
[01:18:00]  Mad love.  Sanchez, who needs far?  Oh!  Oh, shit.  You heard what he said?  Far, who needs far?  I had no idea what he's fucking talking about.  You know what's great about Chunky, too?  If you remember, he is the DJ who is not from New York, who was trying to be local.  He's from Detroit.  Oh, so he likes the Lions.  He doesn't even like the fucking Jets.  Of course not.  Oh, that's awesome.  I forgot about that.  He's an import from Detroit.  I remember when we had, like, the Patriots. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, God.  So we shouldn't talk.  When he was first on, you heard shit like, yeah, so I went down to the village last night.  And, oh, there was a great club down there.  Then I went to New Jersey via the Lincoln Tunnel. 
[01:19:00]  See, Anthony's just being hurtful today because when we moved to Boston, we actually had a packet of info in front of us.  So we knew who the mayor was.  So we knew which roads people took in and out of fucking Boston.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Hey, how about that Route 9, Opie?  How about that Route 9?  1923 now, though, imported the entire station from Detroit.  That's crazy.  Like, they're all from Detroit.  Why?  It was a Detroit pop station that they just all moved to New York and pretended they were from New York, every one of them. 
[01:19:30]  That's wonderful.  So that's the second song that David Hinckley needed to talk about on the page.  Is the next one another rap song?  No.  You know, I don't want to sound like I'm out of touch or anything, but that rap music is just a little scary for me.  No, this one's as white as it can be, yes.  The final.  The final Jets song of the day.  Oh, boy.  What happened there? 
[01:20:00]  What?  No, that's Bart Scott, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Cutting his promo.  Yeah, this is what he did after the Pets game.  Yeah.  You got to do this, and then you get into the song.  Yeah.  So all the non-believers.  How did that?  So all the non-believers.  Especially you, Tom Jackson.  Way to have our back, Keyshawn.  Anybody can be beat.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  I got to cry now.  Uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[01:20:30]  Crying.  Cresting.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  They broke my nose.  Samples.  They can't stop a nosebleed.  Stop crying, Ben.  I got it from a Negro.  This is New York.  This is Sunday.  Six stars.  See you, Bisper.  Can't wait.  Knocked you out once.  Now we going two rounds.  But I think Big Ben needs to lose a few pounds.  Bart Scott coming.  Watch your chest.  Watch out.  Roth this burger.  Heard your German sausage.  Watch your chest.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  Did he get a ham sausage?  He got you so young.  I think he needs a babysitter.  Ben getting bigger.  He's off on his time and went to one-to-one-too-many dinners with his offensive lineman.  He can't be a pitch whale.  Shamu.  I'm holla, mama busy trying to peddle some shampoo.  Very fat.  Free safety looks like a singer.  And you ain't gonna get one for your index finger.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, there's a big slant going on.  Don't be damn scared.  The glory days are in the past.  It ain't a mystery.  Look at Mike Wallace. 
[01:21:30]  I think he thinks he's Mr. T.  Oh, Mr. T.  I don't care if you're a fighter.  Shit.  Oh.  Look at the Sennheins.  More to a retirement.  Sure.  Free taking naps in your hands.  Or do you leave too frustrated like you caught in the friend zone?  You read a record of the same and so, so recycled.  How could you control the offense?  Can't control a motorcycle.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I live in Pittsburgh, I might just cry.  I bleed green and white since I'm from NY. 
[01:22:00]  If I live in Pittsburgh, I might just cry.  I bleed green and white cause I'm from NY.  We got something to prove.  The streets raise me.  L.T.  Super Bowl time for the Jets.  I already booked my trip to Dallas.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  Wow.  That put me in a trance.  I'm sorry.  We should have stopped that an hour ago.  I phased out.  What happened?  I started off all like, like, what up?  And I was all into it.  And I was like, yeah, what up?  Where the fuck did my wallet go?  By the time I end.  Oh, shit.  It's the music.  Was it?  It's the music.  Yeah.  It makes your wallet disappear?  The music just automatically makes all of your valuables disappear. 
[01:23:00]  What is my wallet?  It's amazing.  I don't know if that's the case.  Anthony, you know what?  Yeah?  We need to get our asses back in the paper.  So I think we need a Jetsong.  We could do that, right?  We could talk shit, too.  I already got it.  We could whip one up.  I already got it.  I made it and everything.  You want to hear it?  What?  How'd you do that?  Wow.  What?  How'd you get that done so quick?  I'm that damn good.  You're professional.  That's good.  E-Rock, you got my Jetsong?  Oh, shit, yo.  Huh? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, this will show them.  Yeah.  Face right up in your grill, bitch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a remix.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  This is my shit.  We're talking Jets.  Yeah, we're talking Jets.  I like this.  Say Rex Ryan, too.  Yo, Rex Ryan.  Go be flying like a jet, yo.  Jet, jet, jet, yo. 
[01:24:00]  That's it.  That's my song.  I kind of like it.  That's my song.  It's called David Hinckley.  I got one.  It's worth some ink.  It's Paul McCartney's song.  I think it's worth some ink.  We were talking over it.  Oh, that's the remix.  Yeah, we did a little something.  Come on, fucking give us some credit here.  We said Rex Ryan, and we had a few uh, uh, uhs in there.  What the fuck I'm doing over here?  We're good.  His vocals were still there.  Booger Couch, Mark and Saw, Elton John's, Rexie and the Jets.  That's good.  That's good.  Can we record Rexie and the Jets after the show today? 
[01:24:30]  Rexie and the Jets.  God.  You know, that would be a huge hit because it's that fucking bad.  Rexie and the Jets.  We'll talk about that during our production meeting, right, guys?  Rexie, Rexie and the Jets.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  It's embarrassingly bad.  We should make it after the show.  That's what we do on Fridays.  Stay after and do production.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm in.  I heard you the first time.  On a snow day?  Yeah.  I'm not biting.  It'd be great.  I'm free all night.  You're here, right?  Late, like, five in the afternoon. 
[01:25:00]  Rush hour.  I want rush hour home on a Friday snow day.  That's when I want to leave.  All right.  We'll do some parodies then.  And then I won't even have to leave because it would take me just a few minutes.  Just as long as you get home as the weekend.  You know.  Fuck that noise.  I actually stayed up.  I stayed up and I made another Jets song.  Really?  I sure did.  You have been putting in some time on this Jets thing.  I know you bleed Jets green is why.  I sure do.  I sure do, Anthony.  We all try to do our share, our part, to let the Jets know that we're behind them. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  We want to see a Jets victory this Sunday.  Do you got the words I wrote out for you for this one?  Oh, shit.  No.  I'm just stalling until he queues up the fucking song.  You got my Jets song there?  Thumbs up?  All right.  This is for the big game Sunday.  Oh, shit.  Rex Ryan likes feet.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, this is what he likes. 
[01:26:00]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Rex Ryan, yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh, my wife's got a black guy's mouth on her feet.  Just take your shoes off  Yeah, yeah  Rex Ride likes defeat  Rex Ride likes defeat  He wants victory, but he likes defeat 
[01:26:30]  Get it?  Losing focus on the Steelers  What? Oh, oh shit  Turn this off, this is the part that makes it a Jetsong  And he wants his wife to let her foot loose  Let her foot loose  Her foot loose  Yeah, yeah  A black guy sucking on her toe  Doesn't fit, but I don't care  Well, he had to say feet and went  He's black  Yeah, foot loose, yeah 
[01:27:00]  Everybody loves her foot  Doesn't rhyme with loose  I don't care  There you go  Nothing's got a rhyme  Can you call David Hinkley?  We're good now  We got two now  I guess so, but that seemed more like a song about  Rex Ride's wife liking black guys  Yeah  Sucking her toes  Well, she does  Excuse me, asshole  But ever since that tape came out  The Jets won  Okay, okay  We started winning  You're right  It's been the motivation  So we talk about his wife and how she likes black feet  Wait, who likes the feet? 
[01:27:30]  Well, black guys like her feet  Oh, black guys like her pussy  And Rex Ryan likes  Yeah  He seems to enjoy watching  I'm sorry, Rex  I have no idea what you're doing when you're not coaching my team  But he seems to enjoy watching black guys sucking on his wife's feet  Yeah, which means it might be leading to something else  Oh, cuck  A little cuck action  A little cuck  A little cuckold  Well, what do you think really happens?  A black guy just holds her feet and sniffs them and then he goes home  Yeah  All right, take it easy, Rex  Thanks, man  I'm Addy 
[01:28:00]  Next time  Or is he filling her up with his manhood?  Oh, shit!  Yo, that's  That's cray-cray  Cray-cray  That's cray-cray  I mean, I got other fucking jet songs, but I think it's your turn, brother  You want to go  Someone's suggesting we rework Renegade by Styx  It doesn't get whiter than Styx  Styx is pretty fucking white  But I would want to do Mr. Roboto

[01:29:00]  What happened to the songs they sang before this?  It took so long, this intro  This is not  I am  It's not as hard-hitting as the other Jets songs  Secret, secrets, I've got a secret  This song sucks up ass  We're not going to go with this one  With one of these big long intros  Yeah, but this is where we have like, you know, fucking sound clips  Oh  Every sports song  I wish it was still the secret that my wife has his toes like my black eye

[02:14:30]  nah  I heard  about it  didn't see it  the creepiest  documentary  I've ever  seen  it's a bold  statement  I've seen  some creepy  ass  documentaries  one of them  is a tranny  the other one  swears he's  best friends  with tiffany  and she has  a restraining  order  maybe he is  maybe he is  somehow  he manages  to find her  at everything  she does  and convinces  all these people  that they're  really good  friends 
[02:15:00]  there's  two of the  saddest  creepiest  loneliest  individuals  you'll ever  see  and we got  the trailer  Tiffany and I  have known each  other most of  her life  and we are  in love with  each other  and she's a  great singer  the difference  between me  and a stalker  oh my god  look at this  guy  I know you're  cutting it  oh my god  I love  the individual  as a 16  year old  she was  forced to  get a  restraining  order  against  Jeff Dean  Turner 
[02:15:30]  they have  my whole  name in  there  I am  the  serial  I think  you might  need to  seek some  counseling  I might  ask for a  fingernail or  toenail lock  of hair  or a scab  or a skin  from a blister  or something  I could ask  for that  wow  he's crazy  he's got a  creepy room  with just  black and white  photos of  Tiffany  oh all over  the house  wow this is  creepy  Kent  is it a  good  documentary  it's really  good  it's not  Netflix  you can't 
[02:16:00]  look away  I mean yes  I go through  a monthly  period  and you know  PMS  and period  just like  everything  a large  school woman  does  including  Tiffany  a lot of  people think  Jeff Turner  is  a crazed  stalker  a madman  but I know  him very well  and there's a  different side  of this story  what people  don't know  about Tiffany  could fill  many documentaries  and many books  he is kind  hearted  he is  considerate  what's wrong  with Tiffany  that she draws  this fucking  kind of nut  I have no idea  I've been a lot 
[02:16:30]  not talking to you  just talking  I've never had  the same amount  of love  returned back  to me  which  I don't know  it would look like  if I was a tranny  it's easy to have  romance  it's just  the other  the young lady  or the lady  saying yes  that's it  that's a big  part of it  is the lady  saying yes  for almost  14 years  I'm not  kind of  slowed down  now 
[02:17:00]  oh my god  he's putting on  makeup  there they go  is he going  to the Tiffany  job  from the one  who was  and is born  to love you  he writes  on the back  Jeff says  that Tiffany  means  a lot  to him  too  but  well  mine is  I think  I've got  I think  I've got  him out  matched  easy  oh my god 
[02:17:30]  this is for  Tiffany  huh  this is  craziness  yeah  you gotta  see this  fucking  trailer  oh look  it puts  his eyebrows  on with a pencil  he takes it  and goes  this guy's  crying  he's a middle  aged man  and then this  guy has  tiny little  fucking  boobies  what the hell  is this  he's a tranny  and the two  stalkers are  meeting each  other  at some  kind  of  convention  why is  Tiffany 
[02:18:00]  draw these  kind of  why is she  allowing to be  filmed with  these creeps  they just  showed  Tiffany  hugging one  of the guys  maybe she  didn't know  this documentary  gets seen  blow the lid  off everything  oh boy  change everyone  for the better  blow the lid  off you  oh  wow  the movie's  on instant  watch  and it's  just  so creepy  and the tranny  I'm not sure  if it's  an operation  tranny  or some  weird  genetic  had both  operation  tranny  yeah  okay 
[02:18:30]  wow  the coffee  cake  awaits  enjoy it  the crumb  cake  good  not as  good as  I remember  it  you want  to go  double  crumb  no  it's  just  not as  good  as I  remember  it  when I  was a  kid  that's  really  sad  they  changed  it  somehow  but  that's  really  fucking  sad  I hope  it's  that  case  and I  hope  it's  not  the  fact  that  my  taste  buds  changed  or  something  no  hey  you see  that  lady  but she  is  I hate  that  fucking  word  she's  trying 
[02:19:00]  to  who's  she's  trying to  actually  find  someone  to sue  so  yeah  it was  a viral  video  last week  she's  on her  phone  texting  and she  falls  into the  fountain  at a  mall  and the  mall  guys  did  exactly  what  they  should  do  get  that  fucking  shit  online  immediately  hysterical  she's  fucking  texting  she's  fucking  texting  and she  walks  forward  right  into a  mall  fountain  right  and  it's  hysterical  everybody  was  laughing  and now  she's  trying  to find 
[02:19:30]  someone  to sue  even  though  they said  she's  gonna have  to take  care of  some of  her own  legal  problems  beforehand  she got  a few  shenanigans  in her  record  hired a  lawyer  and she  plans to  sue  the mall  she claimed  she could  have been  seriously  hurt  and that  the security  guard  should have  helped  instead of  left  Thursday  the security  guard  responsible  for leaking  the video  was fucking  fired  well maybe  you shouldn't  have  been texting  and not  looking where  you're  going  to sue  that  and you  want to  fucking  hit him  and what  do you  mean she  needed help  she needed 
[02:20:00]  help getting  out of a  foot of  water  she got  out fine  exactly  dunce  everyone's  quick to sue  we're very  litigious  our society  is very  litigious  I find it  fascinating  that they  got that  right  what did  they zoom  in on her  did the  camera like  were they  just like  this chick's  going right  into the  fucking  yeah they  got they  had one  they knew  they had  one  yeah  there's  probably  some great  footage out  there  I bet  that's  happened  before  and that's  why they  aim the  camera like  that  I'm sure  it is a  dumb place  for a 
[02:20:30]  fountain  I must  say  because if  you're just  walking and  not looking  you are  going in  let me see  that again  railing or  anything  yeah but you  don't need a  railing  you have to  protect people  from  you will now  yeah every  mall  they put a  railing around  there now  that's true  bunch of  fucking idiots  we're stalling  because of  course you  can't watch a  video without a  fucking 30  second spot  now  Berks  County  mall  it's gone  viral  we've shown  it here on  bid day  usually we  show these  viral videos  and then you  know we laugh  about it  and then we  move on  I guess it's 
[02:21:00]  a little  different when  a woman lives  in your  area  this woman  lives in  Redding  and now  apparently she  wants to  sue  her name is  Cassie  Cruz  Marrero  Marrero  is her last  name  she tumbled  into the  fountain  you see it  right there  we showed  it to you  she's talking  she's texting  on her cell phone  an attorney  to look into  this matter  so everyone  hey the mall  put the fountain  in my way  or is she upset  that we see it  because obviously  this is a mall  camera  is she upset  that we have  it  that we're all  watching it 
[02:21:30]  true  she need help  by the way  we talked  she got right  out of the  phone  Wilson about it  she did fall  down again  while  she got a  claim as  of yet  her attorney  said he's  doing an  investigation  yeah but  what's her  claim going  to be  her claim  may possibly  be that  the mall  didn't properly  secure  the fountain  area  or that  her privacy  has been  invaded  or slander  or something  like that  yeah she  couldn't get  into how  did this  video  get released  suing the  water  suing everything  very injured 
[02:22:00]  you know  that goes  hence the  name viral  but anyway  she's facing  by the way  unrelated  theft charges  and Wilson  says that  could make  it even more  difficult  for her  to pursue  a lawsuit  she's facing  theft charges  what did she  steal  calories  she's fat  text  and walking  just put the  phone away  until you  sit down  look at her  wet footprints  as she walks  away  go ahead  try to sue  good luck  to you  oh by the way 
[02:22:30]  that documentary  I think we're  alone  now  horrible  fucking  horrible  response from  the viewers  from the audience  but the critics  seem to like it  seem to like it  71% for the critics  and 25%  from the audience  that would be  7.1 out of  every 10 critics  how do you get  the .1 part  I don't know  we're going to  break and  do something  Debra Gibson  and Tiffany  in studio  in about a half hour  plugging Mega  Python versus

[02:39:30]  year  oh shit and what the american idol people  are trying to do and i like the guy  we've talked to him many times on the  show i would consider him sort of a  radio friend  but they're trying to shove steven  uh tyler down our throats they're  trying to make it like you got to  watch because steven tyler and his  one-liners he's crazy  he's not very good at one-liners  they're saying he is ryan seacrest  tweeted he's he's good at one-liners  and you better watch to and and and  and tweet me your favorite one-liner  from steven tyler  right oh yes i follow ryan seacrest do 
[02:40:00]  you ryan seacrest also says that he  knows what dick clark is saying  true so i wouldn't take but they're  banking on steven tyler as sort of  like the simon replacement not as the  mean guy but the main guy you know  what i mean star like randy's just  there yeah and uh j-lo's doing the  paul abdul thing and steven tyler's  supposed to be the big personality  star but not the mean personality but  the kind of a little mean little one  liner a little uh you know scat shit that  he does why did it is give me my two 
[02:40:30]  budget right right and i think he showed  his abs last night so that was terrific  because he's pushing 60 something now  so uh yeah they're down 13 percent uh why  did they just go with a replacement like  get another wacky fucking mean english  guy they're all over the place you know  that formula people are just mean the  formula seemed to work right yeah i don't  know gervais gervais is red hot right  now i know right fucking ricky gervais is  red hot remember when we used to have 
[02:41:00]  him on it was great so he was all when  he was overweight um he was in between  projects no uh facial hair no right and  uh he hung out for like the whole show  dare i say greasy hair greasy hair now  he's all fucking now he's trim and fit and  fucking uh hotter than uh ever he really  is hot i i mean physically and you know  professionally right and it turns out that  that piers morgan was the one that started  the rumor that people were mad at uh ricky  gervais and the golden globe yeah this 
[02:41:30]  piers morgan is really trying hard to get  his name out there but he's doing it by  lying like what's he fucking doing never  stopped us oh that's true he's uh i heard  he dropped though uh to third there in the in  the ratings oh yeah that show's doomed yeah  it really is doomed the slot would never  had fucking ratings even when larry king  had the fucking thing for years it was a  weird choice because i watch america's  got talent so i know a little bit about  piers morgan and he tells it like it is  but cnn came to him and said you can't 
[02:42:00]  tell it like it is or you're not going to  get all the guests that we need for this  show to be successful so he's in a weird  spot plus the fact that um it's not a  live interview show people like watching  live tv larry king was live yeah maybe  they're gonna eventually go live right if  they were pissed they'd get up and walk  off and he'd be like ah someone just left the  show by me piers uh pretty much did a  softball interview uh with howard yeah  uh i don't know what you ask him at  this point he's been asked everything  the oprah was kind of softball-ish yeah  and he's known he's known to tell like 
[02:42:30]  it is the uh oprah winfrey network also  oof doing bad oof yeah we're losing a  bunch of uh viewers yeah i think elo needs  to call us and uh give us a show and own  will we could do it we could do something  yeah because they're doing weird  rerunny shows and stuff and then they  give everyone that has ever known oprah a  show right like yeah hey elo you fuck  give us a show on that own i've checked  out the own and um i i like the behind 
[02:43:00]  the scenes reality show they're doing on  her final season reality and quotations  obviously reality um i kind of like that  yeah yeah does it tickle your vagina  tickles my vagina she has a lot of white  middle-aged women working for her and and  gay black guys oh is that her uh demo and  elo in his own category whatever the hell  he is drunk or used to be anyway i think  he leans middle-aged woman yeah i don't  know i don't even know what that means but 
[02:43:30]  owns not doing well no no i read that uh  their ratings were way down from when it  launched but that happens like with  everything someone wants to check out well  there's always a curiosity no matter what  and then yeah how it works is curiosity  they know that they're gonna do really  well then they know they're gonna have the  spike down and then they hope the build-up is  somewhere yeah in a respectable place  that's how that always works a consistent  kind of build after the initial spike and  then the drop-off right you get like a  slow little staircase build and and they're 
[02:44:00]  advertising the hell out of own it's on  the top of every cab in new york that  it's on other channels that have nothing  to do with all like the yeah they convinced  cbs to advertise her channel that's what  satellite radio did yeah i know they  advertise on regular radio but um i i heard  you got to pay for own eventually oh is  that what it's gonna be yeah why would you  pay for that i don't know do you pay for  any channels i don't know extra channels  you got your cable package i don't know  i get everything you yeah but you bought 
[02:44:30]  a package you know what i mean but then  past the package you buy shit like i'm a  big hockey guy i could buy the any the  nhl package see i don't get the nhl  packages i don't get any of that shit  right uh but everything else i do have  yeah yeah yeah all right uh oh is he is  he really let's go to matt in minnesota  matt hey uh i was listening to uh jay thomas  on wednesday and they're doing an ira  impersonation contest are they oh i should  go in there i like doing ira impressions 
[02:45:00]  jay thomas is a dick oh now take that  back to him you can't fucking share a  fucking guy fuck you guy like ira you  know right you must let us wet our beaks  right you hold your iras in your pocket  like so many nickels and dimes fucking jay  thomas we had him on once right i think  we did yeah we were probably nice to him  actually i think we were i didn't mind  him until he fucking started playing  that behind the scenes bullshit take our  ira away yeah we were doing good stuff 
[02:45:30]  with ira so you got the american idol not  doing well um sasha baron cohen's gonna  play saddam hussein in a new movie that's  weird what is he going serious now is it  a serious one or is it gonna be on us is  it gonna be wacky saddam i don't know i  don't know the details on that because i  had because i i wrote all over my  material today uh yeah you wrote with  racist terms things that rhyme with  racist words yeah a lot of words that  rhyme with um trigger i might even so  now i can't read my material today i 
[02:46:00]  might even listen to the replay today  yeah yeah i might actually get throw  myself a bone and listen to the replay  and listen to the fun and hijinks and  shenanigans i kind of like the jet song  break that was fun uh you got jesse james  uh he's getting married to that tattoo  bitch right kat von d kat von d we didn't  find attractive when we interviewed her  no nice liked her they gussy her up for  the tv show it's not the tattoos either by  the way no no just kind of funny looking  some shit happening with her kind of 
[02:46:30]  funny looking you think she's funny  looking yeah she got like this uh weird  look going on that um like in the tv in  tv on tv on her show when they they do  that quick camera pass by right and the  quick cuts right you're like for two  seconds you're like i can't assess if  she's like good looking yeah really  quickly but then if you see her for a  length of time you're like oh yeah she's  not but man she could do a good tattoo  holy shit it's amazing i've watched the  show a couple of times it's like a  photograph on on people ridiculous is 
[02:47:00]  that some people find that like it's  like not they don't look at it like a  tattoo it's like yeah yeah but it it's  like purists look at that shit and go oh  yeah it's a portrait it looks exactly  like a black and white photograph of  somebody and they're like that's not a  that's not good like they don't like  it why because they like the purist kind  of just colorful cartoony tattoos oh i  see i don't know they don't like  portraits no no some some of the purists  don't like that shit i don't have any so 
[02:47:30]  i can't say anything about it you're all  tatted up yeah he's got two fucking full  sleeves i sure do he's got an anchor on  his chest i got i mean my left arm is is  dedicated to all the people i've pissed  off in the radio business so shit so that  goes from my fucking left arm that goes  from my fingernails all the way up to my  shoulder blade so i did that for myself  they're all represented on everyone's  represented holy shit can't get a i can't  get a high in this place at this point  holy crap what the fuck did i do 
[02:48:00]  wow oh my turkey chili's here angry  birds ant yeah uh once again i curse  uh somebody out great shitter game they  either tweeted me or or or it was an  instant feedback and said i i didn't beat  angry birds because i didn't get three  stars on every board yes so now i'm  obsessively trying to get three stars on  every fucking board and i and i beat all  the every single board it's very difficult  it is right mm-hmm but angry birds is 
[02:48:30]  now being developed into a tv and web  show what that'll be a complete disaster  what are they gonna do unless it's like a  kid show they'll get cartoony voices and  uh i don't know i don't know how that  works hold on i could actually see it  being a kid show like the birds are  fucking fighting the pigs and right and  they you know but they're not gonna fight  the pigs it's pc shit they're gonna get  along oh they'll think it's like cops or  something yeah it'll be the subliminal  like yeah yeah all the big the black 
[02:49:00]  bird that hits the cops the pigs that's  got to be redone black bird rules and  angry birds not that one what's the big  fat fuck the red one the one that you  just slam into the side everything just  falls down yeah that's a good one you  get that one a little later on nothing  better when you get a board and it's  three big fat fuck red birds easier  thing i hate when you like it goes on  there's this big building you have one  red bird and one blue little thing i  hate the blue bird you don't like the  one that splits up no it is annoying 
[02:49:30]  though you got to time it right what  what what about when your finger gets  all fucked up and all of a sudden you're  shooting the bird left what the fuck's  that about how does that happen or you  go to pull back and then you're like oh  wait i didn't want to pull back that  far and you go forward a little bit and  then the thing just dribbles off the  front of it yeah like it like a slingshot  like you came too early yeah it's like  your third come of the day is a little  blerka blerka love that game do you like  the uh the yellow triangle guys that  saw through everything yeah that's  pretty cool and you tap too early and  all of a sudden it fucking flies off the 
[02:50:00]  screen yeah you got to get the hang of  those oh yeah love that stupid game i  think i like the big black uh bird with  the bomb thing though yeah the bomb thing  is good yeah um no my favorite is  exploding bird wait wait you drive him  into the side and then you hit the  button again and it explodes you kind of  get him inside the building and that's  the um that's a isn't that a white one  that's the uh oh that's the uh they  drop the eggs no not the one that drops  the eggs the one that just explodes it 
[02:50:30]  it goes in to the uh structure and then  if you leave it alone it'll explode or  you could tap the uh that's the black  bird yeah the black bird okay oh but it  doesn't drop it's not the one that  drops the eggs oh i know yeah what's  your uh least favorite bird in angry  birds least favorite is the dumb useless  red one just the original one you get  where you pull it back and it goes  and it hits something just goes pink and  bounces off i got a better one which  one boomerang bird is a nightmare you 
[02:51:00]  could do some damage boomerang bird  don't boomerang him just slam him into  shit i did learn that just don't fuck  boomerang the key is don't boomerang  sometimes you have to boomerang him  though if there's something way around  a corner right and then you got to  figure out the boomerang but you can  just slam the boomerang into stuff  and then sometimes he just boomerangs  and doesn't hit anything and flies over  your right over your slingshot i fucking  love that game love angry birds i don't  need a detailed game like fucking uh call 
[02:51:30]  of duty or anything like that not  anymore when i get the call of duty i  play angry birds yeah angry birds any  any of the truckers blaming you for  angry birds eddie the trucker what i  handle yeah what's going on guys hey  i want to choke anthony because he  said something about the angry birds  and i downloaded it and i've been  fucking hooked ever since yeah it'll  it'll get you it'll rope you in thumbs  up today yeah i'm sorry yesterday i was  listening to the replay and hope he said  something about the uh getting all three

[03:03:00]  we had to get the house with the gates  the house that pop music built  that was a big money pit  were you near billy joel's old house  we were  we'd pass it along the way  and he was my idol growing up  his used to be on the corner there  we all knew that  if you lived on long island  you knew where billy joel lived  yes  sorry tiffany  sorry california in the house  i have no clue  what part  uh well  chino hills actually  is where i was last living  chino hills  by the jail  by the prison  yeah thank you  very much  i'm in again  i'm at the club 
[03:03:30]  i lived in san juan capistrano  go ahead  i lived in the oc  i was in capistrano  dana point  laguna beach  well i lived in newport beach  newport coast for many years  yeah  and now i'm in nashville  oh see  you really went different  yeah  you could go east coast  west coast  west coast east coast  but you kind of stopped  and  i said i'm okay here  yeah  i have eight and a half anchors  and i'm good  oh that's amazing  that's the thing  that's what sucks about new york  and long island  and shit like that  you wind up  you look in the paper  what you spent on a house here 
[03:04:00]  and you look at like tennessee  and stuff  and you're like  oh great  i could have a castle  or i could  have a fixer  you really can  la is the same way  i moved to la  and the first place i went  was sunset plaza drive  which is so stupid  and again  it's if you get  you know  nothing for a ton of money  and then you go  what did i do that for  it's just your brainwashing  and thinking  right  but you're like  oh  sunset plaza drive  right  and then it's really overrated  in nashville  i wouldn't even get out of the car  because we pulled up  this huge long driveway  beautiful home 
[03:04:30]  tons of property  and i was like  no thank you  i'm not doing this  coming from california  i'm not doing the big overhead  i've learned my lesson  yada yada  and finally my husband was like  no come on  get out of the car  do it  and i'm like  i'm not doing this  i'm not  you know  this is the whole point of moving  i want to be here  i want to  you know  do an album  i've got all these other things  i'm going to spend money on  because we can totally do it  when i found out the price  it was disgusting  yeah  i wish i had moved there  and bought five homes 
[03:05:00]  for the price i paid  for one in california  we all  we all make our little mistakes  early on don't we  and then again  i'm a new yorker at heart  so i could see paying  like two million  two million dollars  for a box in new york again  just for the convenience  of being able to get  anything you wanted  i'm a retail queen  so i come in here  and i'm like  oh over stimulation  where do i go first  and over  it's overpriced  hey we have  we have to hit the coach store  because you know  what they're selling now  you know it's in  no python  shoes and bags  i think that'd be great  to wear the python  representing 
[03:05:30]  wear  wow  what a plug  you know how to plug  you know how to plug  she does  hey are you got  mega python  mega python  versus ganoid  god's so funny  you bring it up  i know  i'm actually shopping  for gatoroid shoes  we can help you with that  were you guys supposed  to hate each other  back in the day  i don't remember  we were supposed to  we were supposed to  and then how did you  become friends  we never were enemies  pythons and gators  have united us  pythons and gators  and bears  oh my  when you're running 
[03:06:00]  for your life  you become quick friends  exactly  it was like this  kind of made thing  between you two  years ago  made for the media  yeah yeah  it's like oh  well  who's gonna  who's gonna be gone  who's side are you on  there's  there's debbie gibson  the wholesome  little home girl  and then there's the  oh wild and  raucous tiffany  were you ever wild  and raucous really  yeah it was  no you're like  betty and veronica  kind of a thing  it was like an archie's 
[03:06:30]  thing  oh my god  yeah it was  what can i say  it was  okay with it  she was a good girl  and i loved that  actually because we  were so different  yeah  and how real was  your good girl persona  it was so real  can i tell you something  i did not order my  first glass of wine  or first glass of  anything till a year  ago  yeah  yeah  yeah  it's it's true  now it's total  debauchery  but back then  no  it really  it there was no  persona in fact much  to the dismay of  publicists they were 
[03:07:00]  like give us a little  scandal would you i  mean this is really  hard to work with  here  yeah there was  really nothing  nothing  did you see what  hat she wore today  yeah right she's at  the bowling alley  again  wow  she scored under  a 100  oh scandal for a  long island girl  that is a scandal  you were like you  were kind of like  the britney spears  you were the first  britney spears  there  except not i was  more like the  taylor swift  like she's i mean  i look at her and  i i i kind of see  me like she's like  i sit in my room  and i write songs  about boys 
[03:07:30]  i did too  okay  and who are you  i don't know  who would you  compare yourself to  a wacky horn it's  the law  oh who would i  compare i don't  know  not kesha right  let's keep  kesha  oh god that's  too much  yeah that's crazy  compare myself to  well i mean my  idols have always  been stevie nicks  but uh young  teenage idol i don't  know someone that's  kind of happening  now like that's a  tricky one  lady gaga  not lady gaga  i love her though  i mean um i don't 
[03:08:00]  know i've always  liked christina aguilera  i was about to say  what have you  crossed  that was kind of  if i could have  done fashion  at my time  because i mean  if i said that  earlier because  a black skirt  that was too high  everybody freaked  out but i would  have went there  and now don't  take because  people either  love this person  about to name  or or don't  and don't so  don't i'm saying  this in a good  way there's a  little like  miley cyrus to  me has a like  that big voice  that comes from  the bottom up  and she sings  live and that to  me is what  tiffany's always  had so i would  say christina 
[03:08:30]  aguilera and  miley were sisters  and they had  another sister  it'd be you  and she's got  a little scandal  behind her  but she's got  kind of a little  rebel earthiness  everybody keeps  asking about  do you think  she's growing up  too fast  and the video  is never  too sexy  and nowadays  that's just the  way that it is  yeah when we  were you know  younger and  clothes were  silly  well no  clothes were  clothes were  required  and you know  it was a career  breaker if you  stepped out too  far that was 
[03:09:00]  really not  acceptable  yeah back in  the 80s there  was no uh you  know out of the  limo shot up the  skirt thing  exactly  that would  be good  not to mention  we were actually  wearing panties  though we were  that's the thing  i mean  stupid  jeans and  vans and bad  hair  i didn't even  want to put heels  on like i remember  the male record  execs going you  know wear a  little black dress  and black pumps  and i was like  i kind of wanted  to hang on to  my youth as long  as you're 
[03:09:30]  possible my  electric youth  oh my god  you've got that  of course  we know  we know a  little bit  i know the  electric youth  a little bit  look at that  she's doing it  for us  look at that  fantastic  nice  i watch that  all the time  on the mtv  you guys  you guys made  shopping at malls  really fucking  difficult by the  way  really fucking  difficult  i blame you  right tiffany  i'm a shopaholic  because of it  well the malls are  crowded with all  your fans  something right  here today  who came up  a shopping  addiction  who came 
[03:10:00]  up with  the malls  celebrity rehab  they didn't know  what to do with me  actually the label  had signed me  and put me in clubs  i actually started  working clubs here  on the east coast  and people love the  music hated me  so that didn't work  well i was 15  and it wasn't  fancy like i ended  up doing the clubs  but i had the remixes  and my music was  very club oriented  so it worked  yeah but we were  like you know  to an audio  older audience  what 21 22  and here's this  15 year old  what it  where's the bond  you probably got  a select few 
[03:10:30]  that really liked  it i just basically  never told my age  they would have  came forward  um so they put  me in the malls  as a last ditch  effort to save  the project  which made  perfect sense to  me because that's  where i shopped  that's where i hung  out  it kind of did  start something  it did i mean  didn't like  justin bieber  play malls  i mean it kind  of really did  start something  it makes perfect  sense  yeah it did  and then you  should call  and thank you  the biebs  oh he's so cute  oh isn't he  just adorable  he is cute  and i i said 
[03:11:00]  this the other  day on a tv show  and of course  you know his fans  now hate me  but he's really  cute however  like what is he  doing vacationing  on a yacht  with his 18 year  old girlfriend  at 16  that's where the  trouble begins  to me that's  like that was  the first misstep  for him  it looks cool  yeah that ass  but no but really  at that age  at that age  that's a little  there's no  that's a little  bit much  but there's no  talking any sense  into anyone's  head at that  age that you  shouldn't be  doing that  it's like  are you crazy  no it's it's  it's you can't 
[03:11:30]  talk any sense  in anyone's  head with that  much money  who's calling  the shots  that's my  point  and but he's  still 16  like you have  your son is  how old  18  would you have  let him do  that at 16  um well he  has friends  that are older  and he's always  had friends  that are older  i mean i think  if if he's on  a yacht and  there's supervision  there it doesn't  matter how old  if they're going  to get into  trouble and do  things they're  going to get  into trouble  so to age  is really not  a big deal  so my thing  is if he's  16 and on 
[03:12:00]  a yacht there  should be some  kind of  supervision no  matter what  even if he's  with his guy  friends  right  well there's  at least a  paparazzi  he's gonna  cross that  point now  that that  you guys did  where you're  you're not  the the kid  anymore doing  it you're an  adult doing  this and and  i know debbie  you could you  kind of you  did broadway  yes and that  that kind of  put you over  as an adult  singer i think  it kind of and  i never thought i  never overthought it  and said this is  a transition  strategy so the  point of that is  i think that if 
[03:12:30]  you're um i  think if you  naturally are  allowed to  progress and  make a  transition  it then the  fans go with  you and you're  not selling out  if you're being  authentic if the  record company is  like how are we  going to help you  with this transition  now which also  happened through my  music it all gets  very convoluted and  people kind of  smell um that  it's trying it's  being orchestrated  yeah and that's  when it doesn't  really work it's  when you don't  notice that any  changes happen  one person that uh  and i'm not even a  fan or anything but 
[03:13:00]  uh leanne rhymes  pulled that off like  she was a little  kid  what do you mean  not of every  album  but uh she just  all she did it  right though yeah  hey wait a minute  she got older and  she still  somebody left her  alone to just  grow up naturally  yeah i think they  didn't make a big  deal out of it  that's my point  you know sell the  deal to you right  she just grew up  naturally and it  was and they let  her talent and  voice carry it  through yeah it's  when these little 
[03:13:30]  girls start  proclaiming i'm a  woman now if you  have to proclaim i'm  a woman now you're  not a woman that's  what happened i  think with britney  spears you saw  that with lindsey  lohan  okay i sang all  of britney's  albums that's easy  you heard it here  first and that's  easy to do right  you guys probably  get frustrated by  the the singers that  they just create in  the oh the auto  tune you must love  that oh i i mean  there are some  albums you literally  are like it should  say the artist's  name and auto  tune on the  really  yeah it's it's 
[03:14:00]  funny because  you cut a vocal  and an engineer is  automatically starting  auto tune and i'm  like whoa yeah  you're auto tuning  the soul out of  this so just lay  back i could  actually hit the  note thank you  very much or if  the notes a little  off but the  emotions there it's  a better thing i  think some producers  get carried away  though and i think  the artist doesn't  know maybe at that  time you know  you're so thrilled  that you've gotten  a record deal and  maybe you don't know  enough to say i  can really sing it  go ahead when the  artists don't they 
[03:14:30]  can't carry a tune  and then they get  auto tuned and they  they actually think  they sang it that  well right yeah  and then it's really  bad she's really  bad man she's honest  it's true i've  produced records for  people like that and  they come back they're  like i sound good  that sounds good  i'm like we've just  comped like syllables  together and auto  tuned it happens and  by the way we have  the uh fucking  part of your tape  which is isolated  and i'm going to be  putting it on the  web well that's 
[03:15:00]  that's scary now  yeah yeah you  guys still singing i  have no idea oh  yeah you guys still  like oh yeah i've  got a new album out  i brought you a  couple of tunes  all right do we  like it is it our  is it our uh demo  like we're middle  aged guys it's for  the movie it's  mega python  all right the  movie we haven't  even just  it's a great song  she sounds killer  i'm doing country  now i'm doing like  country blues project  a new album i'll  check it out next  month what's the  movie about  obviously it's  it's about me and  tiffany having a 
[03:15:30]  cat fight  i hear there's a  cat fight  gators in it  no yeah you  guys got big  parts i play um  oh we're  no no we're  extras  we're day players  i have three lines  she has five  i'm in the  background i play  this animal activist  who um  cares cares deeply  about um pythons  and i don't like  the idea that  they're being  kept as domestic  pets and  you're a ranger  but i could care  less about every  other animal in the 
[03:16:00]  everglades right  giant deadly  animals who gets  really irritated that  she releases these  pythons in the  everglades and is  completely destroying  the nature  the ecosystem  but i love that  because you do  that because that's  so symbolic of what  activists do they're  like they care they  care about their  cause but they don't  care that it's wreaking  havoc on everything  else and everyone  you know it's like say  the pythons kill  everything else i don't  care about other  animals yeah you know  the pythons will be  scooping up and how  big does this python  get well there are 
[03:16:30]  steroids involved and  uh oh and again you  know there's a dvd that  i start giving you know  the gator steroids which  the python somehow  mixed with that why  would you do that  that's still the line  or it's like you're  feeding dead chickens  on steroids to the  gators and all the  chickens killed my  fiance and so i so  you got you need a  little revenge so you  snap and again it's  all in the name of  saving the python so i  don't care now what  about gatoroid gatoroid  is the juice step  gator that becomes 
[03:17:00]  gatoroid hello it's  all absurd it's awesome  do you have to like  kind of make the fight  happen to get rid of  the python guy thing  no we just don't like  each other i crash her  party her big event  which mickey dolan's is  singing at mickey dolan's  mickey dolan's this is  great i am so i think you  just sold the song i am so  watching this yeah it's  gonna be on sci-fi january  29th it should have been  davy jones though girl look

[03:18:30]  it's great man it's fun it's  really fun and again why not  team up with the backdrop of  this of these absurdly yeah  giant critters and i love the  sci-fi channel movies are  always hysterical they're great  they are you know i didn't  realize how many like closeted  fans are in my family they're  like oh my god we always like  sit back with a tub of popcorn  on a saturday night watch the  original movie i'm like  really uncle carl i didn't  know that the movie is about a  giant spider they call it like  megalospider oh yeah the 
[03:19:00]  mega thing oh yeah the people  that title the movies i think  spideropolis are just a room  full of monkeys that just throw  things around and go okay we'll  call it mega spider well now i'm  addicted to saying mega before  everything i'm mega excited  everything's mega great i know  there's enough good morning yeah  it's it's i just put right at  the end of everything there's  enough there's enough heaviness  it's a harder thing to do that's  a big commitment right there i'm  gonna hold you to it anthony we  might have a connection to debbie  gibson what do you remember your 
[03:19:30]  dentist name on long island okay  ready i am gonna pull this out and  you're not gonna dr stanton is that  not who said he was my dentist how many  dentists that was in merrick do you  remember a dr nagel that sounds  vaguely familiar but he was on long  island no i don't think i went to  any other dentists on long island  eric is lying coming into the studio  swears you're a liar swears dr stanton  was on merrick avenue and operated 
[03:20:00]  out of a little like a little house you  know it was like that little very long  island little shingle outside where was  dr nagel located wrong name and wrong  doctor um where was that eye doctor  in merrick eye doctor i have 20 20  vision this was the it was a colorectal  doctor i know i kind of got nervous  what kind of doctor is he gonna flip  out no this was the uh first time that  i met debbie gibson i was like eight or  nine  okay first of all maybe you thought it was 
[03:20:30]  you glances son of a bitch it was the  eye doctor how'd you know it was no no  on a serious note what town it was in  merrick no in fact i think my mom  actually at some point worked for an eye  doctor yeah so yeah i don't i don't  think i went to him i hate to tell you  that my favorite is i get people that  are like oh my god my sister babysat you  growing up i said i never had a baby  all right defend yourself no that was  the first time that i got to my records  over here  no

[03:21:30]  there she was buying candy and that's  where we went and got the photo you  had a blockbuster well that i might have  done that's not that odd that's crazy  it's odder than me being at the eye  doctor let me confirm i still can see  really well maybe maybe you were the  after like you know before i was a blind  person you were there for an after  thing who's the doctor maybe maybe  she'll remember where's melissa tell her  to send over the picture what was the name  it wasn't nagel or whatever no no no  shy shy yeah i don't know you want to 
[03:22:00]  throw another name in the blockbuster  sounds plausible but that was the first  time that i met her it was like 87 hold on i got  a place out of nowhere a nagel appears the  show swerves to avoid it but there's no  the nagel is just too big and has made too  many mistakes the hosts scramble to get a  hold of the situation yeah you just want  to talk to debbie get up so you made up a  story you're a mega idiot no i've been
