 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York, Johnny Lang, his latest, lie to me.  Actually, it's not his latest anymore. He's got another album out.  This guy's just knocking these albums out like crazy these days, huh?  18 years old and he's on his second CD already?  What a guy.  Not too shabby. It's open, Anthony. Hello, hello, hello.  Hey, man. What's up?  Good afternoon.  Don't look at me.  Just wondering, curious.  Don't freaking look at me. 
[00:30]
 If you're ready, remember, if you still deserve to be Grand Pooh Bah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Well, did you get action last night?  Last night, no, but I was inducted into the club last week.  Okay.  One week ago, there's no ruling saying you have to do it every week.  Well, I'm part of the new club.  What is it?  I didn't get Jack Wednesday. 
[01:00]
 You're the Grand Pooh Bah.  What did I tell you yesterday?  I don't care what you told me yesterday. It's like Cy Sperling walking around with a bald head.  I told you yesterday that there was no way in the world I would be able to become a member last night because we were going out with the boss.  Doesn't matter. Excuses.  What, you wanted the boss to, you know?  No, what time did we get done?  We didn't get home until, I don't know, 11.30 or so.  So?  I had a half hour to pull it off.  Oh, not pulling it off. 
[01:30]
 He's supposed to get a Hummer.  It didn't happen.  All right, well, you're a two-week loser.  Everyone wants to know. No, it did not happen.  You invent the little club and what happens?  Well, I'll take the club away if you like.  It's not taking the club away at this point. It's got a life of its own.  Come on, I'm taking my club.  No way.  Well, just, I mean, it would be, I think, beneficial to you, with the grand poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, to maybe, oh, get a Hummer. Duh! 
[02:00]
 It's not working out, is it?  Not yet. There's always next week.  Oh, there's always next week.  Yes, there's always next week.  And you said if I don't get it next week, then I'm not a member?  Then we're going to start impeachment hearings, I said.  For not getting a Hummer.  For not getting a Hummer.  It is something a little different.  It's a whole thing around, yeah.  All right. Well, we've got to congratulate all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Very happy.  Unfortunately, I cannot join you in your celebration. 
[02:30]
 Ugh.  What a miserable life I have.  Great.  Okay.  We've got lots to do today.  Do we need to give out the numbers again or what?  I don't know. Why not?  All right. Facts line, 212957W80W.  The request line, we'll go to that next.  2127571027.  Remember late in the show yesterday, we were talking to Deanne? 
[03:00]
 Mm-hmm.  And we were talking her into giving her husband a little action last night?  Yes.  I think we've got to call her to see if the deed was completed last night.  Yeah, she sounded like she wasn't totally committed.  Yeah.  She got us off the phone by saying, yeah, okay.  But we've got to check back now, do a follow-up.  We'll do it before the hour's up, so stick around.  The Rock of New York, 1027W80W.  Aerosmith coming to town on December 27th, continental arena.  We've got tickets all this week to give away on our show.  I don't know how we're going to blow the tickets out today. 
[03:30]
 Do you, Anthony, have an idea on the tickets?  Anything that you want the listeners to do?  Nothing spur of the moment here.  No, I can't think of anything right away.  I'm sure we will.  If you've got a good idea, you know, we've got Rick working the phone  and we'll listen to your wacky, zany ideas.  212-757-1027.  You know the show by now, so come up with something that we'd be interested in.  Yeah.  And you could possibly score some tickets to Seattle Smith.  Excellent.  Excellent, all right.  Well, there it is on the front page of every paper today. 
[04:00]
 We all heard the audiotapes yesterday.  Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky.  Linda Tripp, she's just a pig.  Look at that.  Yeah, look at it.  Oh, look at that.  She's on the front page for all the world to see.  Do you think anyone calls Linda Tripp at home these days?  Do you think she gets any phone calls at home?  Probably not.  Can you imagine Linda Tripp?  Hey, so how's it going?  Like I'm going to tell you?  Hold on. 
[04:30]
 Hold on.  Let me play and record.  Yeah, let me start up my recording equipment.  Do you want that?  I've got to flip the tape.  I'll be right with you.  Oh, no.  Ew.  Oh, no.  Ew.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Ew, Linda Tripp looks like the sea hag.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Let me see your face.  You want to see your face?  Give me a little inspiration.  Oh, my gosh.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  The sea hag.  Ew. 
[05:00]
 I'd rather sleep with Brutusk.  Ew.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Ew.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Well, blow me down.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Shiver me member.  Yeah, there she is in all her glory.  Oh, my gosh.  What are we going to do about the sea hag?  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Look at that face.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  I like the double chin.  It's cute.  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  It's so funny.  I like to have a double chin.  Ew. 
[05:30]
 I like to have a double chin.  I like the double chin, it's cute.  Wonderful.  Oh me gosh, she looks like Wimpy.  Wait, let me turn her, oh wait, upside down she doesn't look too bad.  Oh like that thing you used to see when you were a kid?  Yeah.  That optical illusion, one way it would look like a hot looking chicken, you turn the page  upside down and it looks like Linda Tripp.  Yeah. 
[06:00]
 That's pretty close.  So there you go, everyone is talking about that.  I'm sure we passed that over enough yesterday, right?  And then you've got Dennis Rodman marrying Carmen Electra.  Two complete losers that deserve each other.  Dennis Rodman has one, maybe two good years left in the NBA and then he's going to be  just a mess.  And Carmen Electra, she's famous for being hot. 
[06:30]
 I always loved the celebrities that are famous for just being hot for the moment.  She was hot for a moment and now she's married to this guy.  You think that's like old lovey-dovey that marriage?  No, it's just a three ring circus.  You know what I heard this morning on Regis and Kathie Lee?  Kathie Lee bashing the marriage.  Well I don't think it'll last.  I'm thinking to myself, you know, what a bitch.  How could she even come off after everything she says about the tabloids and everything? 
[07:00]
 And then she admitted she doesn't know them.  She doesn't know them.  But she's making an assumption based on what she reads that their marriage isn't going  to last.  Well, how long have they been married?  Maybe they haven't been married that long, but I don't think he's screwed around on her  yet.  There's one point for them that you don't have.  She's a trip.  She was bashing them saying that it probably won't last.  I agree. 
[07:30]
 It probably won't last.  No, it's a charade.  It's stupid.  It's one of their little stunts.  It's pretty silly.  And his agent is all saying that he was drunk when they got married and it should be annulled.  I don't know.  No, but he's saying he's into it.  So we wish him luck.  Entertainment.  A happy little couple.  That deserves to be on the front page of the Post with everything going on in the world.  WNEW, the Rock of New York, the Dave Matthews Band, the latest from those guys that's crushed 
[08:00]
 YouTube before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, anything going on in the instant email today?  No, actually people saying thank you for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Does it look like we have a lot of brand new members?  Yes.  It does.  People are very happy with the situation there.  And a couple of people asking why the pictures of Phyllis were taken off the webpage.  We took a beating yesterday and we promised her that we would take the pictures off after  the show.  From time to time we're going to be popping shots from the studio onto the webpage and 
[08:30]
 you can go there and look at what we're doing as it happens.  And usually we'll keep the pictures up there for a few days in case you're riding home  when everything is going down and you want to check out the pictures when you get home.  But in Phyllis' case we promised we'd get rid of the pictures after the show.  I got the gallery girl from yesterday.  I got a few head shots of her.  Do you want to pop that up today?  I'll pop one or two of those on so people can see what she looked like yesterday.  Alright, go to the WNW website, click on our pictures after you get to the air staff section 
[09:00]
 of our website and then there will be a live studio cam link there or something like that.  Yes, something like that.  It will be pretty obvious.  Speaking of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, remember the couple we talked to real late  in the show yesterday?  Yes.  It was Ed and his wife Deanne.  We called Deanne at home and there was a crying baby and it just sounded not fun at all at  home.  It sounded like there was no sexuality going on in that house.  And Ed begged us to call his wife to help him out a little bit because he wanted to  become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[09:30]
 Right.  Well let's call them up and see what's going on and see if they actually became members  last night.  Hello, this is Ed.  Ed, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey guys.  What's going on?  Oh, just trying to work.  Well, we're all patiently waiting here.  We're wondering how you did last night.  Well, I thought you were going to ask my wife.  Well, we wanted to ask you first.  Oh, well she became a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Well, she became a member before I did.  Oh, there you go.  Now that's nice.  All right.  Did our little talking help you guys?  Yeah, but it cost me.  What do you mean it cost you? 
[10:00]
 Well, she got a little embarrassed and so now I got to buy her something from Victoria  Secret.  Oh no.  So we can assume that you are a member.  Oh yes.  All right.  There you go.  Congratulations.  There we go.  Bravo.  Thank you guys.  How did it all go down?  How did it all go down?  That's very funny.  Was it like an awkward situation when you came home or?  No, not at all.  I just got this nice smirk on her face and a little bit of redness in her cheeks and 
[10:30]
 once the kids were in bed and so on.  Things just progressed nice and slowly from there.  Yeah.  We just got to know.  Would this have happened, do you think, if it were not for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  on the Opie and Anthony show?  The way it happened last night, no.  There you go.  Deanne.  Yeah.  Hi.  We got Ed on the line with us here.  Okay.  So you guys became members last night.  Oh, you already filled you in, huh?  Yeah.  He filled us in. 
[11:00]
 We were wondering what happened with you.  Well, hey, I'm happy.  How cool.  Congratulations.  I think we both had a good night's sleep last night.  You did.  Yeah.  So that started a little romping, didn't it?  Well, let's say we started before midnight and finished after.  There you go.  What, 1159 and 1201?  Okay, 1202. 
[11:30]
 All right.  Well, I'm glad we could help you guys.  Well, hey, I have to say though, you know, you guys embarrassed me incredibly.  Oh, why?  Why?  I can't believe you're calling me to talk about this on the air.  Well, when it's all out in the open like this, isn't it a relief?  It's a freeing experience, isn't it?  That's what it's all about.  I don't know.  I'm thinking like you guys owe me.  Well, we owe you now too.  Like you owe me.  Well, we can figure something out.  I just think it's time to talk about sex openly again. 
[12:00]
 Sure.  We're all a little hung up.  There's a lot of couples out there.  They don't know how to go about asking for what they want.  So you're just helping them out, huh?  That's about it.  Well, you guys became members last night.  Yeah.  And I don't think you would have had a night of action if it wasn't for us pushing you  along a little bit.  Well, maybe, maybe not.  Now today you're humming a happy tune.  Well, after Ed vacuums and after he... 
[12:30]
 Oh, you better be humming a happier tune.  Oh.  I'm not going to let him get off though.  It always comes down to that.  It always comes down to that.  It was like one night of the old days and now it's right back to where you guys were.  Thanks, guys.  Well, congratulations, guys.  1027 WNDW, the Rock of New York.  Haven't heard that song in a while.  The Cult Firewoman.  Hendrix and the Wallflowers in there. 
[13:00]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  A little later on you got a chance to win tickets to see Aerosmith.  Also, don't forget on Monday we're going to be interviewing Kiss.  Yeah, that's cool.  We got the whole band coming in and we're very, very excited about this.  And of course, you know, we're always looking for your help with the radio show here.  So if you got a question you want us to ask Kiss for you, you can fax those questions in today as well.  A lot of audience participation goes on with our show.  Yeah.  It's just going to get more so, too. 
[13:30]
 212-957-WNDW is the fax line.  You know, we get some of our best stuff from you guys, so keep it coming.  All right?  Yes.  Want to take a call here?  They're ringing off the hook, sure.  212-757-1027 if you got something to add.  I.N.E.W.  You guys aware of who died last night?  Who?  James!  That's the role.  She died last night?  Yeah.  You're lying.  I swear.  It was on USA Today.  I was looking on the USA Today website.  Look under the life section.  Whoa, wait a minute.  Died on a Tuesday night. 
[14:00]
 Hold on.  Anthony's online right now.  Hold on a sec.  I can't believe we didn't see that.  Not Estoroll.  Don't say Estoroll.  Anthony saw Estorolls in the city about two months ago.  Estoroll died!  She really died?  Yeah.  Oh, we need a little tribute.  Yeah, a tribute is definitely in order.  All right.  Let's get a little tribute together.  Let me see.  I'm waiting for the page to come up.  It's very busy.  Probably a lot of Estoroll fans trying to download this. 
[14:30]
 That server is taking a lot of hits from the Estoroll fans.  Died overnight.  No cause of death was given.  Maybe that pack of hot dogs stapled to the back of her neck had something to do with it.  They exploded.  James!  Like a ballpark frank.  James, I'm dead, James!  All right, we're going to do the Estoroll tribute.  Great.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Good times!  Anytime you need it, baby.  Good times!  James! 
[15:00]
 I'm so free.  JJ's been arrested.  James!  Like it has a  Where's Thelma?  Turning tricks.  Head up a water  Woohoo!  Making a way  Wow, Estoroll's dead.  A temporary layoff  Good times!  He's a credit ripoff  Sing it, baby!  James!  I'm dead, James!  Good times!  Hangin' in a jar  Woo!  Good times!  All right!  Be free if you've got a 
[15:30]
 Aww.  Good times!  Woohoo!  No more good times for Estor.  Oh, yeah!  Estor's good times are behind her.  Well, she was a psychic just a little while ago.  You think she knew she was dying?  James, I see I'm going to die.  James!  That was, she was always into  black activism, you know,  promoting blacks in a good light.  That's why I guess she played a 
[16:00]
 maid on every show she was in.  What movie was she the maid in?  Driving Miss Daisy, right?  I think she was the maid in Driving Miss Daisy.  She was a maid in, let's say, Mod.  Right?  Yeah, she was made in Mod.  Spun off to good times.  And yeah, good times.  Good times!  That was, that had to be like one of the most racist shows  ever.  It was supposed to be a good thing for blacks,  that show, but it turned out like every episode 
[16:30]
 Junior, J.J. was bringing home his friend the Pimp  or something with the floppy hat.  Yo, J.J., I need a place to live.  Well, come over to my house.  And he'd come in and start ripping off the Evans family.  Junior, you get him out of the house, Junior.  James, be nice.  The boy just needs a home, James.  Shut your ass, Sparta.  With that pack of hot dogs, stay but at the back of your neck.  Big ass rolls of fat. 
[17:00]
 What was going on with Thelma, too?  It looked like she was turning tricks on the street.  Yeah, she was always out.  Never knew where she was going.  And then, uh...  And Michael?  Michael, I don't know what his whole thing was.  I know he was always preaching that Jesus was black on the show.  And, uh...  Hey, Earl, you think Jesus is black?  J.J. worked in a fried chicken place.  I mean, there were more black stereotypes on that show than anything.  Well, we got a black man in the studio. 
[17:30]
 Earl, James campaigned a ramp today.  James, how you going to feed my fat ass?  Was Good Times an accurate portrayal of the black community?  Hell no.  And sure, positive.  Well, if anyone thinks I'm fibbing here or anything,  let's take a look on the Good Times webpage  at some of the quotes from the show.  Okay.  This is from J.J.'s 18th birthday show.  Michael says,  Hey, J.J., what'd you wish for? 
[18:00]
 And he goes,  I wish I could be rich  that I could sit back in my Cadillac and have a big match.  That's some great dialogue  for advancing black society on TV.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's good.  And, oh, J.J. got arrested on his 18th birthday  on that whole show.  Florida, let's see, Michael shouts,  I bet you wouldn't be sticking it to him if he was white. 
[18:30]
 And Florida says,  Michael, that's enough out of you.  Let your father do the talking.  And of course, the father says the same thing.  J.J. fits the description,  a tall, skinny young black man,  and he says,  You just described most of Chicago.  Dynamite!  Oh, poor, uh, rest of all.  Very sad.  That's our little tribute.  Hey, can we play our tape  where we called Jimmy Walker's talk show?  Oh, yeah, where is that? 
[19:00]
 I got it somewhere.  I forgot about that.  J.J. had a radio show.  Where was it?  Iowa or something?  Nebraska.  He was in Nebraska doing a talk show.  In the middle of nowhere.  And we found out that he hates talking about good times  and dynamite and stuff.  Yeah, he was doing a political show or something  in the middle of Nebraska.  And he just despises people that talk about the show.  Yeah, so we called up  and we were baiting him with political questions.  All right, I got to find it.  I know I have it somewhere. 
[19:30]
 And then it always came back to good times  and he'd get pissed off at us.  And he kept hanging up on us.  It was very funny.  All right, on the way to the end,  we got Eve Six, Macy DC and the Stone Temple Privates 2.  What are you guys looking at over there?  Which one are you looking at?  Gallery.  I know.  How many issues do we got laying around the joint now?  Too many.  The girl next door thing that Gallery does,  we had one of the winners.  We have the winner in yesterday.  She was a ringer, by the way, 
[20:00]
 because she doesn't look like any of the others.  I'm looking at linebackers.  Well, Anne, I'm disappointing you  because you were the one who turned me on to Gallery.  You heard we were going to have the Gallery people in here  and you were all excited like,  Gallery, I love Gallery.  Maybe I was thinking back when I was 16.  Well, at lunch today,  you didn't love Gallery too much anymore, huh?  No, it's a whole issue dedicated to the girl next door.  And you just go through pages and pages of girls  that you just don't want to see with their clothes off.  Like their boyfriends take the picture 
[20:30]
 and send it into the magazine.  Oh, my God.  It's like hubba bubba.  Hubba bubba?  What do you mean hubba bubba?  When you chew a whole pack of hubba bubba.  And?  Pull it out of your mouth.  Oh, come on.  You don't have to bait me.  I honestly didn't know where you were going with that.  I was thinking aloud.  Hubba bubba.  Sorry.  All right.  Does the boss like the Gallery magazines?  Oh, yeah, I'm sure he does.  Not really.  No?  No. 
[21:00]
 After studying it, no.  One of them does look like I'm a stuff.  There it is, I am a stuff.  Shave down.  I'm a stuff in the morning.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with this one?  I've never seen so many stretch marks and so many C-section scars  and so many poorly groomed groin areas.  They're all from Portland.  Yeah.  Photographed by her friend David.  Yeah, Bigfoot.  Yeah, it looks like the Bigfoot footage. 
[21:30]
 All right.  We got to move on with some rock here.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Stone Temple Pilots  doing Dancing Days off in Comeum, a tribute to Led Zeppelin,  which is a pretty good city, a bunch of bands that did some of the Zeppelin songs.  And I'm looking at this and Hootie and the Blowfish doing Hey Hey, What Can I Do?  Yee.  That's sacrilege. 
[22:00]
 When it came out, I guess they had a career.  Way to wreck a CD.  You know when you get these compilation CDs and then there's that one track that just blows it.  You can't get to the stereo fast enough to get past it.  Yeah.  Like, oh, well, that's it.  That is it.  Well, we're kind of sad today.  Yes.  Suffering a loss in the entertainment community.  Our listeners had to tell us we weren't even prepared for this today.  Estorol, Florida, from Good Times.  Dead.  Dead. 
[22:30]
 She died overnight.  James!  So we're kind of reflecting on Good Times and Estorol.  And the trifecta is done.  Celebrities die in threes.  I believe that's it.  Red Holes Men.  Mm-hmm.  What's his name from the Chats?  Weebubank.  Thank you.  God, 91 years old.  That's a good contract.  Yeah, not bad.  And then Estorol.  James!  Dunskate.  But I found the Jimmy Walker tape, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  We called Jimmy Walker at his radio show.  This goes back a couple years ago because he's no longer doing talk radio. 
[23:00]
 It's obvious why.  He's not doing talk radio anymore.  He was in Nebraska or somewhere doing talk radio, trying desperately to get rid of the  JJ image, the dynamite thing.  He got rid of that wacky hat, shaved his head, and was starting to do talk radio.  And he wanted to address serious issues on this show.  If you ever want to just tick him off if you see him walking around the streets of New  York, just ask him to do dynamite. 
[23:30]
 He will punch you in the face.  Say, hey, JJ, dynamite!  He hates it.  He doesn't even want to acknowledge that he used to say that.  Exactly.  He doesn't even want to acknowledge good times.  So having that knowledge, Anthony and I decided to spend a whole afternoon calling his talk  show.  Yeah.  We were harassing him.  We were harassing him, and I got a couple of the calls where we act like we're serious,  you know, we act like we're serious, you know, callers to his little radio show, and then  the tides change at the end, and he's hanging up on us and stuff. 
[24:00]
 He was outrageous because he was like a right-wing radio host, a la Rush Limbaugh.  But he was a black guy.  Ooh, he was just outrageous.  Well, listen to this.  Check this out.  Jimmy JJ Walker on Husker Radio 1290K car.  Now, hear his brand of unconventional talk radio.  You can call Jimmy now at 342-1290, 1-800-577-1290, or pound 1290 on your Alliance cellular phone.  Now, Jimmy Walker. 
[24:30]
 I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  I like to move it, move it.  You like to move it, move it.  Jimmy JJ Walker and Omi Ha.  And Husker Radio 1290K car.  Talking about it all.  And we got people that want to talk to me and they want to talk to you.  They got the hour, they want the power.  You know why I give it to them.  You're on with Jimmy JJ Walker.  How you doing, Tony?  Jimmy.  How are you, sir? 
[25:00]
 Hey, it's great to hear the show finally a voice of reason that we could listen to on the radio.  Well, I think I'm reasonable.  That's all.  I just consider myself a logical right person.  Yeah, that's great because I want to talk about the political correctness going on in Washington.  That's what I think about all this gun control that's going on there.  They're going after the innocent people.  Well, the innocent people are the people that have applied for guns legally.  Absolutely.  It's not a whole deal.  Like I said earlier, the horse is out of the barn.  I'm of a belief that we should abolish that, Brady and all that other stuff, because those who have guns are going to have them in terms of the illegal people. 
[25:30]
 Those of us who apply normally, we don't want to commit crimes.  We want to follow the law, but it seems like they don't want us to do that.  That's exactly what I'm getting.  Do you ever see us to roll naked?  Thank you.  Hey, how's Rerun doing?  Good advice from JJ.  You hear him, though? 
[26:00]
 He's all like, I'm not JJ anymore.  I am James Walker.  James Walker.  And I'm doing a talk show.  And Rerun? What was that about?  It's not even the same show.  How's Rerun doing?  We did this all afternoon long.  K-Card, Jimmy Walker.  Show your first name.  Greg.  Where are you calling from, Greg?  Nebraska.  Omaha?  Yup.  Okay, how old are you, Greg?  I'm 48.  We're just doing some demographic research.  We'll get you as soon as we can, okay?

[27:00]
 Yeah, Jimmy JJ Walker, K-Card, man.  News Radio 1290 in Omaha.  Give me that hour, I will give you the power.  Talking about gangs and the eradication of them  and I don't know why we are so delicate  and gentle with these people, it's not necessary.  God, just like termites or roaches,  they should be eradicated.  And we seem to really be concerned  about rehabilitating roaches.  I mean, imagine that, you know,  getting roaches to be better roaches.  JJ, there's roaches in Thelma's room.  Wouldn't that be nice to have a good train 
[27:30]
 of roaches around the house?  You can choose one, man.  You're on with Jimmy JJ Walker.  How you doing?  Hi, hi.  JJ?  How you doing, buddy?  Hi, first time caller.  I love your show, though.  Go ahead.  I want to know, you're talking about gangs and all?  We got it right here.  Yeah, if JJ was in a gang,  you think it would be a blood or a crypt?  Oh, I don't think so.  None of those things.  No?  Come on, I don't want to ask a follow-up question. 
[28:00]
 They didn't let me ask my follow-up.  No.  Oh, so...  James!  He was so ticked off at us.  Jimmy Walker doing a right-wing political show in Nebraska.  And it was so easy to get through to his show as well.  Oh, yeah.  All right, on the way, we got the latest from Metallica.  Turn the page and keep the faxes coming.  212-957-WNEW.  I want to say hi to Dory and Teresa.  Got your fax here.  We're asking all the listeners to send in their Kiss questions  because we're interviewing the band Monday. 
[28:30]
 Will you guys ever release another set of solo albums?  What are our chances of getting backstage passes?  And why does Paul wear the star?  Do you know the answers to that?  No.  We'll have to ask him that question at least on Monday, all right?  If you got a question you want us to ask Kiss,  keep the faxes coming.  No Rock of New York.  1027-WNEW.  The latest from Metallica.  Turn the page.  Those guys are doing an in-store next Tuesday.  Very happy birthday going out to Kurt Hammett. 
[29:00]
 How old is Kurt today?  36.  Happy birthday.  Very good.  God, man.  Huh.  Wasn't it his birthday last year that we were at the concert?  Um...  Where they came out and like railed him with a silly string and pies.  Silly string and stuff.  Yeah, through caking his face and stuff.  A year ago already?  Yep.  Wow.  Pretty much.  Time flies, huh?  Not too much went on in the past year for us.  Yeah, nothing at all. 
[29:30]
 But the in-store is happening next Tuesday,  4 to 6 at Virgin Megastore, okay?  Cool.  All right.  We got a bunch of requests for the clean motors thing.  Clean motors?  I'm stalling because someone said,  could you please play it?  I want to get it on tape to play for all my friends.  Oh, so you're...  So look, we're catering to one person right now.  Yeah, so we're stopping our radio show so that guy could fumble with tapes right now.  Tell us when you're ready.  Great.  Tell us when you're ready.  That's okay.  No one's listening.  Really no one else listening. 
[30:00]
 Yeah, great.  All right, I'm getting the word that the guy's ready for this.  Well, I hope you spread the word to the show as well.  If you're spreading the bits around, that's cool,  but you know, tell people where they're coming from.  Because I still get emails and faxes from people saying that  Adam Sandler wrote the Hey Masturbator song.  Oh, stop.  No, he did not.  I hate that.  We'll have to get into that.  Maybe we'll get into that later on.  Yeah.  In the five o'clock hour because there's a song off our Demented World CD.  It's copywritten.  Anthony wrote it. 
[30:30]
 Anthony sung it.  It's on our CD.  And we have to face these emails all the time that say,  hey, check out this wacky, goofy new song that Adam Sandler did  called the Hey Masturbator, done to Hey Macarena.  Well, he needs the help right now.  His career is slumping.  He's not doing very well.  He's probably not making that much money.  Yeah, Waterboy's going to make $100 million in what, three weeks?  Sign of the pending apocalypse.  And our CD sells five units every week in New York City.  All right. 
[31:00]
 I got some for you guys for sticking through the commercials  because only the faithful listeners do that for us day in and day out.  Right, Anthony?  We got a pair of tickets to C.A.R.O. Smith.  When you hear the who, eminence front, be the tenth caller at 212-757-1027  and you'll score the tickets.  Not going to mention this again, so just pay attention for the who.  All right.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Live Rush, the spirit of radio.  It's Hope and Anthony.  Hey.  We got to say hi to all the brand new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[31:30]
 They're all checking in like crazy through the fax machine and the phones  and the instant feedback.  Yeah.  I think everyone has Hummer hangovers today.  Let me read because that's all they want to talk about.  Hey, guys, I'm really disappointed to find out that not only is our president of the Hummer Club  not a participating member, but also a wussy for not getting one last night.  Did we have to go little Betty by at 1130?  Very, very disappointed.  Jimmy in Brooklyn.  Opie, the grand poobah of the Hummer Club and he hasn't even gotten his Tuesday Hummer. 
[32:00]
 Anthony, who invented the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  Opie did.  You did.  So why is everyone disappointed in me?  I'm bringing happiness to everyone.  Doesn't matter.  You have to join the club.  You're a false god.  I would like to join the club.  You're put up there as this guy that starts this great organization  and it turns out you're a fraud.  Let's look back. 
[32:30]
 You know what happened 20 years ago today?  20 years ago?  I'm in the hot seat today.  The Jim Jones massacre in Guyana.  900 people died because of a cult started by this guy and he was a phony.  Now do you want this to happen?  No, not at all.  I don't know if I could make that tie in, but I think you're like Jim Jones.  You were trying.  You were trying there.  I didn't know what you were getting at, but you were trying.  Yeah, I was. 
[33:00]
 Know how many people emailed us and said that they joined the club on their way home from work last night?  In the car.  In the car.  A bunch of listeners called saying that they were seeing this stuff going on on the highways and byways.  You've got to watch that.  Because you know when you're in traffic like bumper to bumper traffic and stuff,  you see the same cars over and over again.  You see the people.  Well, this one guy was telling me he saw two people and then half a mile up he saw only one person. 
[33:30]
 That's what happened to me.  Really?  That's what happened to Reverend Al.  What's up, Reverend?  I was participating in the Tuesday evening Hummer Club.  Came around a corner.  Yeah.  Bam!  Smaggle!  Big Mac flew out my mouth.  Now you're in the hospital.  Yeah.  Well, you were.  You're obviously in the studio.  Hallelujah.  And you were in a little fender bender yesterday.  A little conclusion of the brain.  And that's the reason why you guys were in the fender bender, huh?  Yeah.  I was getting a Hummer in the car. 
[34:00]
 When it pad into another car.  Who was the lucky guy?  That ain't very funny.  But I am suing the airbag company.  Why?  For assaulting me.  It popped down and hit me because I am a black man.  You ever see those airbags?  Yeah.  Big white things.  Yes.  Come on, smack a black man in the face.  In the newspaper, I'm suing them too.  You're suing everyone, huh?  Said I'm suffering from a swollen leg.  How did they know? 
[34:30]
 That was no swollen leg.  That's the size of my leg.  Big fat leg.  And I want to thank Jerry Kerr for saving my life.  Yeah?  What did that?  My head slipped right off the windshield with my hair processing.  Hallelujah.  Praise God.  I think that big old medallion saved your life.  Yeah, the medallion.  Help me out.  See, that would have hurt hitting the dashboard.  But the medallion kind of broke the energy that my head would have absorbed on the dashboard. 
[35:00]
 I see.  And you're an official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, huh, Reverend Al?  I was trying.  Okay.  But thank God she lifted her head up before impact or Reverend Al would have lost his  little pal.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what you're saying.  Hallelujah.  Praise God.  I'm having a fundraiser for me.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm fine, but I want a fundraiser at the Apollo Theater. 
[35:30]
 And up there in Harlem.  Come down, help out Reverend Al.  Give me a dollar or you'll hear me holler.  Okay, Reverend Al, everyone, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  I have been vindicated.  Yes, yes.  I have a concussion, conclusion of the brain.  All right, he's leaving.  Hallelujah.  The good Reverend has left the studio.  So he's a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, even Reverend Al.  Now, once again, I've got to explain my case because people are getting on my case.  We were out with the boss last night.  Yeah.  And I wasn't going to ask the boss for a, you know, a humskey. 
[36:00]
 No.  Hi, N.A.W.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Nothing, I just talked to someone.  I explained to them, I kind of christened these guys, the grand poobas of the Hummer  Club last week.  Yeah, you did.  And I'm a lawyer in New Jersey.  And these guys are a big trouble.  I'm going to sue OP for misrepresentation, fraud and deceit until he becomes a member.  Yeah.  Well, give me a time period.  You're time, you should have been the first one to step up. 
[36:30]
 Step up.  It's true.  What happened to me?  What happened to Rick?  We, Rick got one.  I'm ashamed.  I went home.  Jennifer had a lovely dinner, candlelights, followed by a dessert of a hummer.  Great, keep it to yourself.  And OP comes in Wednesday.  He couldn't get one.  So we're like, all right, well, I'm going to sue him.  So we're like, all right, well, we'll give him next week, which was yesterday.  You got to.  OP, you don't understand what the rest of us had to do.  I had to promise to paint the damn living room. 
[37:00]
 Oh my God.  To become a member.  And even though, you don't even have the guts that the man wants to become the official  grand pooba.  See, that's the problem.  I don't think I'm ready to give in anything to get my hummer.  Oh, come on.  I didn't want it to happen.  Well, we're hearing from a lot of guys that they had to sacrifice a lot to get into the  club last night.  You're backpedaling.  Oh, yeah.  You're officially pooba elect until you do this.  You're not even pooba.  I am taking over.  It's a coup happening right now.  I am assuming control and command of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[37:30]
 Wait, wait, I'm taking my club and I'm going home.  Doesn't it?  You can't.  I have just assumed power.  I have the army of people that want hummers that have gotten hummers.  No way, pal.  Get away from me.  I'm the head of the Hummer Club.  I am.  Until you get a hummer, sit down.  Sit your non-hummer ass down.  There's a legal principle called dissociation, and you have been disassociated with this club.  Not yet.  Not without a deal.  You have been thrown out.  Not without a trial. 
[38:00]
 Until you get your hummer.  There's no trial.  This is a coup.  Innocent until proven guilty.  Coup d'etat.  Come on.  You're out.  Come on.  You've been ousted.  Somebody help me out out there.  I ain't going to help you out.  You're a hypocrite.  I'm not a hypocrite.  I created the club.  I need a little slack here.  Doesn't matter.  Come on.  Doesn't matter.  You're out.  I have assumed control.  My girlfriend's jaw is wired shut.  Give me another wig.  Come on.  Rick, you're the secretary of defense.  Hit Opie.  I will not stand for this, you ass.  You're out.  You're ousted. 
[38:30]
 As legal counsel of the Hummer Club, I only represent Anthony.  That's right.  He's my attorney.  Now I'm not even talking to you, Opie.  Talk to my attorney.  Take care, guys.  You guys are great.  Official attorney of the Hummer Club.  You're out.  Bye-bye.  We love you.  Bye.  Well, there you go.  You've taught me.  You've heard from my lawyer.  Someone help me out.  I invented this club.  You're out.  It doesn't matter.  I'm in hell.  Doesn't matter what you invented.  Yeah, it does.  Done.  You're out.  Ousted.  Hi, A.W. 
[39:00]
 I want to defend Opie and his little problem with the Hummer Club.  Turn your radio down first.  We're on like a 10-minute delay.  Turn your radio down.  10 minutes.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Go.  How could you defend Opie, who's allegedly supposed to be the secretary of defense?  I defend Opie, who's allegedly supposed to be the head of this club, and he hasn't even  gotten a Hummer.  I just wanted to tell him that he shouldn't feel bad because I've been begging for one  for the last two weeks, and I haven't gotten one either.  Well, then you're not in the club.  I'm sorry.  I wish you were.  I wish every guy was, but officially you're not in, right? 
[39:30]
 Right.  Well, Opie has in, so he's not in.  All right.  I understand I'm not an official member of the club I invented, but you can't take my  grand poobah status away.  You're gone as poobah.  Your poobahdom can be reinstated after you get your Hummer.  Look at the bylaws.  Let's look.  Paragraph 8, Section 325.  The poobah must indeed be a member of the Hummer Club. 
[40:00]
 Now, I am assuming all responsibilities as grand poobah.  Can we take up a collection for a hooker?  I don't care how you go about it, but as respect to all the other people that are members of  Opie, I cannot let somebody who is not a member be the head of this organization.  All right, N.E.W.  Hey, I want to talk to Albany Anthony.  Right here.  Turn down your radio.  All right.  Go.  All right.  I just want to let you know that my wife made a suggestion about, instead of the Tuesday 
[40:30]
 night, she said the Monday night Muff Divers Club wouldn't talk about it.  Well, we'll work on that one problem at a time.  I think we'll let that fly through.  Well, I'll tell you.  All right.  Well, you've been overthrown.  You're out until...  Fine, I'm taking my club and I'm going home.  You can't.  I'm taking all my Playboys that I hid under the shag carpet up in the tree for.  Yes, I'm taking it all home.  Have fun with your little club.  That's it.  You're out.  Bye-bye.  Well, I do have a song for everyone that's not an official member of the Tuesday night 
[41:00]
 Hummer Club, Anthony.  Club of the People, Opie.  Well, there's a lot of guys still out there not members.  And ladies, because the ladies become members as well.  That's Opie's song.  He's not a member.  Well, that's off our CD, Opie and Anthony's Dementia.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you. 
[41:30]
 Well, that's off our CD, Opie and Anthony's Dementia World.  For some reason, it's going around the Internet that Adam Sandler wrote that song and they  have all the lyrics and they send it all around to everyone's email.  But Adam Sandler really needs the help.  But that song is copyrighted and it's on our CD and no one cares and screw everyone.  Hey, why don't you just join the He-Man Women Haters Club?  Hey, Spain!  I'll get there.  So what's the official rule here?  The official rule is you cannot be the pooba of this organization until you indeed receive 
[42:00]
 your Tuesday Night Hummer.  Fine.  Am I allowed to mention the club?  Of course.  Am I allowed to help the other poor saps out there and call their wives still?  You would be a better man for it, Opie.  Yes, you can indeed do that, but you are not considered the grand pooba.  You're going to take this grand pooba hat off me?  I have to.  I have to.  I don't want to do this.  It's for the people, Opie. 
[42:30]
 Hello?  Hello?  Opie, Anthony.  Hey.  Listen, Opie, you've got to be impeached.  Sit on a plate.  Exactly.  You can't even be called grand pooba.  You haven't even gotten a hummer.  All right, did you get your lovely hummer?  I was the first one.  I'm the president.  Oh, Fred.  Yes.  Fred is the president.  Yes, I'm the president.  Hey, Fred, but don't you understand if it wasn't for me coming up with this stupid idea  in my stupid apartment...  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter. 
[43:00]
 No, I will.  I will uphold the office.  Okay.  Thank you.  You look completely ridiculous in that hat.  Next.  Next.  Look at...  Why is everyone in line kissing your ring now?  Because I am indeed the grand pooba of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  But...  People understand, respect my position, respect that I know what it's like to be in the trenches.  But the line goes all the way down the hall.  They want to see the grand pooba.  Come in next.  Oh, the official court papers are already in.  In my hand, faxed and signed.  I have lawyers on my side working for me.  The honorable Candy Apples residing on the bench will read the court papers next that 
[43:30]
 gives Anthony the grand pooba hat.  Power.  I love the feeling of power here.  Of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as people continue to come into the studio and kiss  the ring.  Thank you.  Anthony.  Thank you.  The Rock in New York, 1027WNEW.  Hello?  Hi, I'm looking for a Hummer.  Who?  I need a Hummer.  Hummer?  Yeah.  What's a Hummer? 
[44:00]
 You know...  No, I think you've got a wrong number.  How much for a Hummer?  What's a Hummer?  Hummer is, you know...  No, no, no.  I think you've got a wrong number.  Okay, bye bye.  This is going to be impossible.  I've got more numbers.  What do you mean numbers?  Well, for the Japanese massage parlors.  Oh, you do?  Thanks.  Well, I'm trying.  I'm trying anything to get my grand pooba hat back.  She didn't know what a Hummer was. 
[44:30]
 No.  She knew Yankee Cranky.  Oh, wow.  Well, the court papers are here, Anthony.  Congratulations.  You are the new grand pooba.  Of course I am.  Of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  The only way it should have happened.  We've got court papers from the Superior Court of New Jersey.  Docket number 69, civil action order.  Anthony, aka grand pooba, and all Hummer Club members are the plaintiffs versus Opie, aka  ex grand pooba, the defendant.  This order sets forth the decision of the court of November 17th, 1998, pursuant to 
[45:00]
 the notice of motion filed by Paul in New Jersey, attorney for plaintiffs.  The court by the honorable Candy Apples consider the motion with oral argument on November  17th, 1998.  The decision of the court is as follows.  It is on this 17th day of November, 1998 ordered defendant Opie is disassociated from the  Hummer Club until such a time as he reassumes his leadership role as a member.  Isn't it the 18th today?  Oh, a little glitch in the paperwork. 
[45:30]
 You can't capitalize on that.  We're going back to court.  And two, Anthony will be known as the only grand pooba of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  until such a time as Opie becomes a member and provides full details of the decision.  And finally, the Hummer hat will be sent to Hummer Club Legal Counsel for safekeeping until such a  time that Opie becomes a member, if ever.  I'm not buying that.  I wear the hat.  Honorable Candy Apples.  Throw it at me. 
[46:00]
 Jackass.  All right.  On the way, we got delays from Johnny Lang and some Van Halen too.  Oh, well, we don't have spots.  What line can I go to?  Two.  Two.  Great.  Hi, NW.  Is that Opie?  Yeah, what's up?  I got a solution for you.  What's the solution?  Anthony's mom is busy tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that girl you used to go out with? 
[46:30]
 Give that little line to her when you go over to her house for dinner or something.  I'm sure she'll just love that one.  All right, I take that back.  That's right.  The solution is, that girl you used to go out with that looked like George the Animal  The one with the hair down the back.  I hung up on him, Anthony.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Van Halen Jump.  Ladies from Johnny Lang before that, still raining.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And I'm just in a horrible mood now.  Well, you've lost your...  We have a whole new audience, so why don't you quickly explain what happened, Anthony? 
[47:00]
 Opie, the inventor of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, which has made a lot of guys happy over the past couple of weeks.  They're getting hummers from their girls on Tuesday nights.  I challenged him today on his grand pooba status because he is indeed not a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  And I don't see how a non-member can run the organization.  Me being a member, I felt I was more suited to be the head, the grand pooba, 
[47:30]
 wear the illustrious grand pooba hat.  That hat looks ridiculous on you.  At least it's legitimate.  It's justified being on my head.  It's ridiculous.  You've got the strap around your chin.  I'm wearing it proudly.  Four feet high.  It looked better on me.  I'm wearing it proudly.  It belonged on me.  You, I had to wrestle away the grand pooba from.  Because you're not a member.  And I don't think it's out of respect for other members. 
[48:00]
 You can't be the pooba.  And my statement to all our listeners, I hate you all.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  Well, because we left it up to the listeners in the end.  And I was looking really good there.  You had four to one.  And all I needed was one lousy vote and you came out of nowhere to take the crown.  Well, people with sense started calling.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  What's up?  Not much.  Who is this now?  Opie. 
[48:30]
 Hi.  I have a question.  Did I ask you already?  I asked somebody.  Am I still a member of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club if I did it with somebody else's boyfriend?  Of course you are.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do I get bonus points for that?  That's probably a lot of bonus points.  I don't know what you get.  But yeah, there's no rules who it has to be.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  That's fun.  Alright, congratulations.  Thank you.  Bye.  Now, Opie, there's only one person really responsible for keeping you from being pooba. 
[49:00]
 One person holding you back, let's say.  And that is your girlfriend.  Right, of course.  Sandy.  Yes.  And I know that we call people's girlfriends on Tuesday.  Explain to them what the Tuesday Night Hammer Club is about.  And it's usually successful.  So I'm thinking maybe the same will work for you.  Good luck.  Like I said earlier, if there's a shuttle mission happening soon, because that's what 
[49:30]
 my schedule is all about when it comes to hummers.  Well, Opie, as pooba, I want to help you out.  Okay.  I am the new pooba.  What are you laughing at?  I'm laughing?  What is her laughing at?  I'm not laughing at anything.  At least I get laid.  Like President Ford pardoned Nixon after he got in there, after Nixon got thrown out.  I am going to help you.  Alright, so what do you want me to do?  I want you to hit line three and talk to Sandy.  My girlfriend.  Great.  Sweetie.  Hi. 
[50:00]
 Did you hear what happened?  No, what?  I'm not the grand pooba of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club anymore.  Anthony overthrew me live on the air.  What are you talking about?  I overthrew his authority as grand pooba of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club and I took his  grand pooba hat away because...  You have a grand pooba hat?  Yeah.  Where'd you get that?  Because he is not a member and he will not regain his grand pooba status until he is a member.  And you are a member?  Yeah, I'm a member.  Oh, of course.  I don't know. 
[50:30]
 Hope is in a little bit of trouble here.  What does he need to be a grand pooba again?  Well, next Tuesday, you know...  Has to be Tuesday?  Yeah, that's why it's the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  Haven't you been paying attention?  No, I haven't.  Oh my God, your own girl.  Do you even listen to our radio show?  Who do you listen to, Rocky?  No, I listen to Z100.  Oh, what else we find?  I like the house music. 
[51:00]
 You ass.  Oh, that's brutal.  This is pathetic.  Not only am I not the grand pooba of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club, my girlfriend doesn't even  listen to our radio show.  Great, sweets.  Thanks.  What can I say?  They pinned me down and they took the hat off my head.  And Anthony is proudly wearing it over there because you didn't come to the plate.  Well, then next Tuesday, right?  Boy, can't wait. 
[51:30]
 I'll mark it on the calendar.  I'll try to be home.  Do you have another date?  How pathetic.  So is that a verbal agreement?  Yes.  Why do you have to think about it?  Because, you know, it's private stuff.  Oh, yeah, it's real private.  The whole freaking city knows I'm not getting homeless.  He was very disappointed at not being grand pooba anymore.  Well, next Tuesday, then he can have his title back.  All right, we're going to have to get your confirmation, though, that it happened. 
[52:00]
 I'm not going to take his word for it.  Oh, my God.  On the radio?  Yeah, on the radio.  I'm not going to take Opie's word for it.  He wants this hat back bad.  All right, you can count on it.  Well, all right.  Can't wait.  And maybe some snapshots.  I don't think so.  All right, sweets.  Yeah, let me write that down now.  Oh, that's romantic.  I don't have anything else going on Tuesday.  I'll pencil that in.  OK.  Speaking of pencil.  Yeah, I'll pencil it just in case something comes up and I'll have to change it. 
[52:30]
 Oh, no, this is great.  I love this.  This is a lot of fun.  Now you know why I invented the club.  All right, sweetie.  OK.  Can't wait to see you.  All right, I'll see you Tuesday.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  No, that was funny.  Thanks.  Well, I'm trying to help as Grand Poohva.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Wow, that's going to be real romantic. 
[53:00]
 Yeah, real romantic.  Shut up.  I'm pathetic.  Look at me.  I don't have my hat anymore.  She's not even listening to you.  She doesn't listen to my show.  All right, great.  I had something to say here, but...  You got nothing to say.  God damn.  Yeah, it looks grim now, Opie, but...  I want to start a new club.  What's your new club? 
[53:30]
 I didn't get Jack Wednesday.  Let's get this facts in.  Linda Tripp looks exactly like one of the Angry Beavers from the Nickelodeon cartoon.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Maria, very good.  I still think she looks like the sea hag.  Well, blow me down.  Here's Zeppelin on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the ladies from the Black Crows, 
[54:00]
 kicking my heart around from By Your Side, which will be out  second week in January.  It's Opie and Anthony just about out the door.  I've got to congratulate Anthony for overthrowing me today.  Yep.  To become the grand poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Got close in the voting.  The purple helmet grand poobah hat looks ridiculous on you.  And I will get it back.  I think I wear it well.  I think I'd make a better poobah. 
[54:30]
 But everyone knows that.  That's how the vote went.  But as long as I get my hummer next Tuesday, right?  I get grand poobah status back, right?  Yeah, but it sounds like I'll be wearing this hat for a while.  I'm putting a bounty out.  A bounty?  A bounty, yes.  To find ladies of the New York area.  A bounty?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You know how you put bounties out on criminals and stuff?  Yeah.  A bounty.  Hey Rick, what kind of tickets we got?  We got good tickets, right? 
[55:00]
 Aerosmith and stuff.  For what?  I've got to get my hat back.  Oh, Mikey, that's prostitution.  Screw everything.  I don't care.  You can't do that.  The bounty has been set.  For next Tuesday.  Another price on a head.  It's like the old bounty hunters used to do.  Well, that's how it used to be.  Hey, I've got to do what I've got to do to get my hat back.  That's all I know.  Whatever you've got to do.
