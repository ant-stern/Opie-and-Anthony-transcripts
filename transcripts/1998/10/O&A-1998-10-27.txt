 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Kiss.  Calling Dr. Love, you got to love that, huh?  And the latest from the boys, Psycho Circus, title track from their latest CD.  And there you go, they're coming to town for a bunch of dates.  Tickets are on sale right now through Ticketmaster.  So Peter Anthony, we talked to Paul Stanley last week and he was talking about the concert  and how cool it's going to be and how they're not going to have an opening band because  he thinks most opening bands are not that great and most people blow off the opening 
[00:30]
 act.  Well he says with the Kiss fans they came to see Kiss.  So for an opening act they're going to have some kind of freak show, some kind of circus  thing.  Freak circus show.  That'll be cool.  They've got to bring back a full freak show though.  Pickled punks, the whole deal.  Well whatever happened to the freak shows?  I don't know, we got too PC for it.  Yeah, I used to go to Ringland Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus when I was younger and  the best part was the freak shows.  Now in this politically correct world you can't show that stuff. 
[01:00]
 I want to see like two headed kids and stuff.  Yeah.  Put them in the circus.  You know they interviewed some of the freaks from the old days and they're really ticked  off at the PC world because they said that was the only way they could make money.  Yeah they're making a living because you have the lobster claws instead of hands or something  and then people tell you that you can't work because what you're doing is degrading to  yourself.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  These same people aren't going to send them money to pay their bills.  Oh no.  They just spread their morality around and then just walk away. 
[01:30]
 They interviewed on TV the half woman.  Oh I see.  Remember her?  Yeah.  She had nobody pretty much from her belly button down.  Yeah.  And she said, you know, what am I going to do?  I'm going to be a cashier at a grocery store?  No.  I would sit in this room, people would check me out and I'd make a bloody fortune and pay  my bills.  Yeah.  And they took my job away because they didn't think it was cool for me to do this.  read while the people parade in front of them.  Just hang out.  Just sit there.  Yeah. 
[02:00]
 And then before you know it, that all went to the wayside.  There you go.  People went broke.  We're the new freak show.  Well we're trying.  That's it.  So if you're a half woman and you want to show off your wares, please give us a call.  That'd be fun.  Right?  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  We got lots to do today.  There's so much good stuff in the paper today.  And we'll get into it next I guess.  All right?  Sure.  A little warm up here.  the phone line if you got something to add to this mess.  Facts is we love facts, especially if you're working.  212-957-WNEW. 
[02:30]
 And the instant feedback we found out wasn't really working yesterday, Anthony, or people  just weren't into it.  No, I think it went down for a slight time.  But it's back up, functioning, www.com.  And email us.  There you go.  1027-WNEW.  The Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with Lizzie, Jailbreak and the boys are back in  town.  The doors and the black crows on the way.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Greetings.  And we've got to congratulate Mike Piazza on the lovely contract he signed the other 
[03:00]
 day with the Mets.  I think he got rooked.  Yes.  Tell you the truth.  Seven years, $91 million.  Now, I understand.  Oh, oh.  What?  Oh.  See, I thought it was just $91.  Yeah.  Oh, well that's different.  The M means million.  Yeah.  Oh, then I guess he's doing quite well.  He is doing quite well.  And I understand that to compete in this world of baseball these days, you've got to pay  your players this type of money.  I have no problem with that.  That's what the game has evolved into.  All right.  But the Daily News, front page of the sports section, in big, huge letters it says, 
[03:30]
 Meant to be.  Piazza admits he just couldn't leave New York.  Who the hell is he kidding?  What a trooper.  What a trooper.  He took $91 million just because he wants to stay in New York.  I guarantee if you offered him $51 million for seven years, you would see how fast he  could call U-Haul.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, the statement was probably like, you know, I wanted to play in Wright City here. 
[04:00]
 Insert City here.  Yes, depending on how much money they were paying.  Because if the Mets didn't come to the table with this type of money, he would have went  to Florida to play for $91 million.  Don't kid yourself.  Sure.  Don't try to act like you really like New York that much because you would have left.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  For seven years, $100 million, this guy would probably play Girls' Badminton.  I would for that price.  Exactly.  Come on. 
[04:30]
 But to have it right on the front page of the sports section, Meant to be, Piazza admits  he just couldn't leave New York.  Is it a joke?  For $91 million.  He would have left.  Trust me on that.  Damn, that's a lot of money.  He's going to help the Mets.  We all know that.  So, Mets is going to have a good year next year.  As I cross my fingers.  Didn't he choke a couple of times?  Yeah, because he didn't get the big contract yet.  Was that it?  Maybe the $91 million contract was on his mind and that's why he couldn't close the 
[05:00]
 deal and keep the Mets in the playoffs?  Pretty much.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Man, how do you screw up like that and then sign a huge deal like that?  I don't know.  Because if we screw up, we'll be out of here.  Well, let's take our career, Opie.  We screwed up in Boston and we came here for like, I think minimum wage.  I think Opie went to our negotiation stating that we were indeed allergic to cash. 
[05:30]
 For some reason, we could be dreadfully injured if someone bestowed any money upon us.  I think that's what happened.  This guy, if I remember, yes, he did choke a couple of key plays.  He up at bats and he sure did.  I mean, you know, congratulations to Piazza.  That's what's going on in baseball today.  That's fine.  But act like you love New York that much.  Cut it out.  Stop.  Stop already.  It is a great city and all, but you would have went anywhere for that money.  There you go. 
[06:00]
 You watch and no one will prove that.  What?  Bernie Williams.  Oh my God.  You think he's staying in New York?  Because that's that just set the bar right there.  That's your free agent bar.  He's not staying in New York.  Bernie could say how much he loves, you know, New York and the Yankees as much as he wants.  But you watch when the numbers start, you know, being thrown at him.  Well, you're going to see the hundred million dollar contracts coming up.  You'll see it before the beginning of next season.  Yeah.  Piazza is the highest paid player in baseball right now.  But next month, someone's going to top that. 
[06:30]
 Obviously, that's where it starts at 91 million.  But there you go.  Speaking of our jobs, Anthony.  You're listening to the fan.  F-A-N.  Speaking of our jobs, I think we're going to start a new feature on our show today.  We just found out that there's a lot of people gunning for our jobs.  Yeah, the boss brought in a box of tapes to our office.  In this business, DJs are like vultures.  So they just hover around radio stations sending their tapes in, hoping that the boss will 
[07:00]
 say, oh, hey, this guy's good.  Yes.  I'll put them on the air.  Yes.  So people are now sending their tapes in to get our jobs.  And are they good?  No, actually, they're not.  No?  I feel pretty, you know, secure right now.  We're pretty confident with the first batch of tapes that came in.  Yes.  Matter of fact, before four o'clock, we will play part of a tape of a guy trying to get  our job.  What's his name?  Do we know him?  Stick something. 
[07:30]
 Sticks?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off. 
[08:00]
 I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.  They always want a better job, I guess.  Never happy where they are.  And they send out tapes of their show to other radio stations, no matter who's working there  at the time or not, hoping that the boss goes, wow, this is great.  I'm going to fire who I have on and throw this guy on.  So the boss has a box of tapes and we went through it.  These guys are all gunning for our job. 
[08:30]
 Yeah, so this is a little taste for those of you who haven't quite accepted the Opie  Show yet, of what might be on the air if we don't cut the mustard here at WNEW.  And in all honesty, the box is just filled with cassettes.  This was the first tape we pulled out.  So we didn't even have to search far for a wacky DJ.  So we're going to check out a guy named Sticks Franklin.  This is Sticks Franklin Opie. 
[09:00]
 He wants our job.  I guess he calls his show Absolute Chaos.  So it's got to be real edgy, wild stuff that he does.  I bet it's Zanerrific.  He's from Minnesota.  Oh.  And he also calls his show Osworld Radio.  Osworld or Oswald.  Oswald or Osworld Radio.  I don't know.  All right.  Okay.  Let's give him a listen.  So let's take a listen to Sticks Franklin.  This guy wants our jobs. 
[09:30]
 Absolute Chaos.  That's Moby with the James Bond theme.  I am Sticks Franklin and this is Absolute Chaos.  I am.  Okay.  We know already he's what they call a yuckster.  In the biz, right?  Yeah.  That's the guys that plug up their voices and talk like this.  Hey everybody.  Hey, it's Sticks Franklin with ya.  No, I am.  I am.  I am Sticks Franklin.  All right.  Let's continue with this lovely little tape.  Osworld Radio.  Time now for, hey, you're going the wrong way. 
[10:00]
 We're playing part of a song backwards.  You got to try and figure out what it is.  Listen carefully.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Whoa.  This is crazy.  All right.  What song was that going backwards?  If you think you know, give me a call.  1-800-552-2470.  Oh.  That's okay.  He knows how to do bits.  That's his little bit.  That's my shtick.  Hey, it's Sticks Franklin with ya.  We're going to play a song about you.  You're going to have to...  All right. 
[10:30]
 So I'm assuming he's going to get a winner here that knows the song, right?  Okay.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  Osworld Radio.  Absolute.  Okay.  Osworld Radio.  This is Sticks.  Who's this?  This is Kessa.  Hi.  I got the answer for, hey, you're going the wrong way.  Yeah.  Is it, uh, I've been at the show with Yves Saint-Germain?  That is right.  You win.  Where'd it go?  What city are you in?  New Brighton, Minnesota.  New Brighton.  Hi.  Yeah, that was Hanson. 
[11:00]
 A minute without you that we heard going backwards.  Do you have any pubes yet?  If you could pick any song that you want to hear, what would you like?  Uh, let's just hear a little Prince Abbey.  Oh, he's a kiddie jock.  Osworld Radio.  He's a kiddie jock.  He's a kiddie jock.  How's he going to relate to the NEW listeners?  Hey, we're going to be dressing up as Barney for Halloween.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, that's a good one.  He's a kiddie jock.  He's a kiddie jock.  How's he going to relate to the NEW listeners?  Hey, we're going to be dressing up as Barney for Halloween.  It's going to be fantastic.  I'm Sticks Franklin, absolute chaos, Osworld writer. 
[11:30]
 Let's take our next caller.  Sticks Franklin says you need a change-in.  How outrageous.  All right, you want to listen to more of Sticks Franklin?  Yeah, let's hear more of Sticks.  I love Sticks.  He's my favorite now.  Yeah, this guy wants our job.  I'm pulling for him.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Osworld Radio.  The Sticks.  Who's this?  Matthew.  Matthew, how you doing?  Good.  You sound like Becky. 
[12:00]
 You know, Matthew, you strike me as an intelligent young man.  Thanks.  Pretty bright guy.  And I'm wondering if you can help me out with a little question here.  Okay.  It's something I've been thinking about all day and I just can't figure out an answer  to.  Okay?  Now, if you're a young man, you're going to be a young man.  You're going to be a young man.  Okay.  Now, if a cow laughed really hard, would milk come out its nose?  No.  You don't think so?  No.  All right.  Thanks a lot for clearing that up for me, Matthew.  Thank you.  All right.  You got a song you want to hear?  Yeah.  Oh, we're in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  By Shampoo.  I'll put it right on. 
[12:30]
 Your music, Osworld Radio.  Osworld Radio.  He should call it Pedophile Radio.  I mean, hi, Sticks Franklin.  Anybody under the age of 10, please call up.  I did you.  Sticks Franklin with you.  All right.  One last.  Hey, Sticks.  Yeah?  Yeah?  The hip came off of my body.  What do I do?  Sticks Franklin, you're just popping back on.  All right.  One more taste of Sticks Franklin.  The guy wants our jobs.  The guy wants our jobs.  Still be there.  It's the Spice Girls on Osworld Radio.  I am Sticks Franklin. 
[13:00]
 This is Absolute Chaos and it's tea time now with Sticks here on Absolute Chaos.  Tea time?  This evening, enjoying a cup of Original Blend.  Of course, though, tea time, not just about having a cup of tea, it's about sharing with  you the words of wisdom, the quotes at the end of the tea bag string.  And this evening it says, only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.  And that is a quote from Robert F. Kennedy.  That's tea time with Sticks here on Osworld Radio.  Here's to the cheek, barely breathing. 
[13:30]
 What is that little thing he does?  What is that?  I have no idea.  He reads, wait a minute.  He reads quotes off of tea bags?  Off of tea bags, yes.  Ho ho!  Hey Sticks!  Is that it?  And he read a quote from Bobby Kennedy?  Yeah, that's what he says.  Ho ho!  The best part of this, though, when he comes out of it, listen to how he changes his DJ  style because he's going into a slow tempo record.  All right.  Take a listen. 
[14:00]
 He's not as wild from Sticks.  He's not as wild at the end of this.  Listen.  Hey!  Your other teammates.  Bye.  Tell us nicely how to have your chubby face in front of people. 
[14:30]
 Who?  The scared looks.  I bet he's got a bad attitude too because he's like, �Sticks Franklin.�  I'm Sticks Franklin, damn it!  You listen to me!  Get it and turn in here!  I'm Sticks Franklin!  This is Oswald Radia!  Go get me some coffee.  Get me some coffee!  Well, I guess our jobs are safe for now.  I don't know.  He was good.  I would listen to more of Sticks.  You would?  Yeah, Sticks rocks.  All right, in all fairness to Sticks Franklin, we should see how he would sound on any day. 
[15:00]
 He's obviously working for one of those bubblegum pop stations.  Yeah, that's true.  All right, so Sticks Franklin, whenever you're ready, why don't you intro the next twofer  here?  Hey, it's Sticks Franklin!  Absolute chaos, Oswald Radio!  Stick around for another one of my wacky bits.  We'll be reading the side warning labels on cigarettes while stroking ourselves.  It's Sticks Franklin!  Absolute chaos, Oswald Radio!  It's the doors! 
[15:30]
 It's Sticks Franklin with you!  Oswald Radio!  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Twofer Tuesday with Led Zeppelin from Presence, Hots On for  Nowhere and Rambalong Before That.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On the way, we've got a twofer from Guns N' Roses.  Guns?  Yeah, we'll do some guns next.  Wow!  I think they finally woke up down the hall.  Look at the music we're getting.  Andrea's giving the speaker the finger right now.  Wow! 
[16:00]
 I'm psyched for playing some guns.  Guns N' Roses on N-E-W.  Gotta love it.  Things are changing slowly but surely.  We like this.  So what's up, Anthony?  Well, I'm looking through the paper and, uh, ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Carson Daly.  Do you love Carson Daly from MTV?  Carson Daly's a... an idiot.  Why is he an idiot?  Because he's got your love?  Well, yes, he's going out with Jennifer Love here, who Opie of course knows is, uh, my  girlfriend.  She just has no clue of that yet and probably never will. 
[16:30]
 And uh, oh yeah, I'm married.  But it seems that on Sunday night, Carson went to Fred's at Amsterdam and 83rd, right?  It was an Upper West Side restaurant with a couple of girls and a couple of his friends  and they just got totally drunk.  says, they were completely belligerent, drunk and obnoxious, stumbling around, bumping into 
[17:00]
 waitresses and other customers, knocking over chairs.  They were dancing and spinning around, spinning each other around.  Carson was bouncing around like a pinball until he fell on the floor.  Eventually we had to cut them off and then they, uh, they threw him out.  Hmm.  We gotta get the bartender on the phone today.  I wanted to say like, hey, you're Carson Daly, not Tom Hanks.  He made such a complete fool of himself and treated everyone like a total idiot.  No, really, Anthony Carson Daly says, popular is Tom Cruise. 
[17:30]
 He's just as talented.  It's really tough to just sit there in front of a camera and read cue cards.  Well, the whole key to this story is the Jennifer Love Hewitt factor.  Opie, this guy's going out with Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Why is he out?  Because guys are, are pinks.  We're all just, we're losers.  We know it.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  He could hang out with.  Yes.  Perhaps, oh, have sex with.  Yes.  And he's out getting drunk with his pals and belligerent. 
[18:00]
 Because guys are never satisfied.  Look at Tommy Lee.  Look what Tommy Lee had and he blew it.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  What's the deal with that?  I don't get it.  So you're saying if you had Jennifer Love Hewitt, can I, can I, Jennifer Love Hewitt  or what love as I've seen from many talk shows.  She says her friends call her love.  Love.  Love.  Say Anthony here.  I would worship you if you would come over to me and dump that Carson guy. 
[18:30]
 I wouldn't be out drunk.  Yeah, but if you worshiped her then she'd want someone else.  I've convinced some girls out there like a bad boy.  So you think that's what he's doing maybe?  Maybe he's playing that role.  I wouldn't even have to learn a new name.  I wouldn't even screw the name up.  My wife's name is Jennifer.  So now I wouldn't inadvertently use the wrong name.  That's true.  You just, hey, hey, Jennifer.  You're really obsessed with her.  Yes, Opie. 
[19:00]
 Yes.  She's a bad girl and I'll teach her not to notice me.  She's a dirty girl too with those love pillows on her chest.  She's very dirty and I have to teach her the right ways.  Oh great.  Or she'll end up like the cat that died and I buried in the backyard.  Yeah, those are cats in the backyard.  It was a cat.  Yes, you are.  I called her a cat. 
[19:30]
 I don't get it.  Carson is an idiot.  That's what I'm saying.  Very good, Anthony.  I'd like to confront him, boy.  I'll smack him in the head.  No, he's too busy reading cue cards.  Welcome to the Jungle.  One of those songs that you can only hear at one level.  Nice and loud, right?  On eleven.  There are a bunch of songs.  When you hear them on the radio, they make you drive really fast.  I think it's an excuse you can use to the cops if they pull you over. 
[20:00]
 It doesn't work if you can use it.  Officer, I was going 110 on the LIE because Welcome to the Jungle was on the radio and  I didn't realize how fast I was going.  You're free to go.  You're free to go, exactly.  All right, so open, Anthony.  Today on the show, one of the things we're doing actually, a lot of good things.  If you want to add something, give us a call or you can fax us.  We went into the boss's box of tapes, box O tapes.  We've discovered that there are a lot of DJs from all over America gunning for our jobs, Anthony. 
[20:30]
 They want their shot in the Big Apple.  In the Big Apple.  They want to come to New York from their many stations.  I saw the tapes in there.  Minnesota, OP.  Yeah, we talked.  Iowa.  We already put Sticks Franklin's demo on the air.  Sticks Franklin from Minnesota.  I think our jobs are secure, but we're ready to move on with another tape here to see if  they got what it takes to get a job at any W.  Our next guy is Marty in the Morning. 
[21:00]
 Marty in the Morning, Anthony.  Marty in the Morning.  Every town has someone in the morning.  And their name usually starts with an M.  Isn't it Imus in the Morning?  Oh, that's an I.  Imus in the Morning.  66, FAM.  But there's someone in the morning in every city in America.  My face is melting off.  Imus in the Morning on FAM. 
[21:30]
 If we weren't so bad, I wouldn't be Imus.  Marty in the Morning.  Marty in the Morning is coming for our jobs.  He is what is known in the biz as a laugh smile jock.  Yes.  Or as opposed to the yuckster, a huckster.  A huckster.  Just laughs all the time.  Everything is extremely hilarious to this guy.  Picture the funniest thing ever, even if you have to delve back to high school where you 
[22:00]
 laughed so hard that tears were coming out, you almost wet yourself.  This guy is on that up one notch 24 hours a day during his whole show.  That's it.  Everything is extremely hilarious.  Even when he's reading tragic news stories, he's got to huck it up.  Huck it up.  Because everything is a laugh riot.  Let me tell you, three teens dead in a drunk driving accident. 
[22:30]
 Jack plays.  Jack plays.  It was Christmas Eve when he got shot in the head.  Yes, her and the baby were killed when the train hit the car.  Hilarious.  Everything is hilarious.  Yes.  You can just picture him laughing and smiling as he talks.  The smile jocks too. 
[23:00]
 You can hear the smile.  Like smile and then say something.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  All right.  So this morning, Marty in the morning is gunning for our jobs.  Let's take a little listen to his air check here that he sent to AEW.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's test your knowledge of the Wizard of Oz.  Linda.  Linda.  Linda.  Ellen DeGeneres.  It's called Marty.  Wait a minute.  What's funny about that? 
[23:30]
 Ellen DeGeneres.  She's a lesbo.  Outrageous Zane Taster.  Let's move on with Marty in the morning state here.  Wait, rewind that.  I got to hear the little promo thing.  Because even the promo laughs.  It goes Marty in the morning.  Marty in the morning.  Marty in the morning.  Marty in the morning.  But I'm not listening so soundly.  Yeah.  Go on.  I'm leading the promo Angular.  It's called Marty, good morning.  Good morning.  That's what my mistake. 
[24:00]
 Oh.  Gunning for our take.  I'm a jerk for a living.  Why?  What do you want to know?  People ask my kids, What did your daddy do?  He makes a fool of himself or adie.  And then he puts food on the table.  At least he knows his position.  Oh, ho, ho.  Daddy, what does your daddy do for a living? 
[24:30]
 And I say, he's an A-hole.  He kneels in front of the glory holes.  This is the Marty in the Morning Show.  Yes, we have no respect for anything, just in case you're wondering.  So we've given you some hints.  You're going from point A to point B and you're halfway there.  Trivia is key.  Oh, again, yeah.  Trivia is key if you're trying to make it in New York radio.  He's a huckster, John.  So let's listen to what type of trivia he's got.  And you're halfway there.  Where are you?  Jeopardy music in the background.  Let's go to the phone here and let's see. 
[25:00]
 Walter from Spring Valleys on WRKL.  Hi, Walter.  Hi.  How are you doing today?  Fine.  Got a guest for me?  I have a guest.  Okay, go ahead.  Midway.  Midway.  All right, Walter.  Got it.  You're the grand high poobah of Rockland County trivia, Walter.  Rockland County.  No, but isn't this like the greatest thing that's ever happened to you?  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. 
[25:30]

 Good morning.  Good morning.  You're throwing good today is or today would be Elvis's 63rd birthday.  Uh, warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Bad Elvis.  Coming at you.  Out of the way.  It's outrageous.  Out of the way.  Elvis bit coming through.  And of course we all know that yes, indeed Elvis is alive and well and making a comeback.  I'm going to come back. 
[26:30]
 That could be the most horrible parody I've ever heard.  No, really, I like it.  It's good stuff.  The king's wearing the pants.  He's crapping himself, kids. 
[27:00]
 Marty in the morning with you.  His blue suede shoes are turning brown.  Check, please.  Check, please.  I'm through here.  Vacuator.  So I guess I don't think Marty in the morning is going to get our job.  I don't know.  He's pretty good too.  Yeah, he's got some good chops.  I don't think he beats Sticks Franklin.  No.  He's a whole new genre.  A genre.  Yes, there you go.  An example of a laughing choc.  A laughing choc.  Got two from you too. 
[27:30]
 Next.  Stay there.  Marty in the morning with you.  He's still out of game.  Hey, it's you too.  These guys are hysterical.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with you too.  BB King helping out the boys when love comes to test.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  BB King helping out the boys when love comes to town.  Mysterious ways before that from a tongue baby.  Sophie and Anthony, don't forget tonight it's going to be very, very cool at 10 PM. 
[28:00]
 We've got the Rolling Stones live set happening right here at NEW.  No security.  So a lot of people have been calling wondering when that is going to take place.  And then before that we've got the listening party for the Bruce Springsteen stuff in the  Hard Rock Cafe.  I want to say congratulations to all the winners again.  They're going to have a lot of fun down there checking out the new boss stuff.  Here's some tracks.  What's going on here at NEW?  A little later this week you've got chances to win cheap trick tickets.  And then tomorrow night we're presenting the REM concert at midnight. 
[28:30]
 So keep it right here.  All right.  What do you got over there Anthony?  Well I heard on the news there's another Viagra danger hoping.  What's the danger now?  And I have a problem with the news too because they were teasing this whole thing because  any Viagra story they've got to tease it.  Save it for the end of the broadcast.  That way you'll stick through the broadcast.  They just said a certain occupation could be very dangerous if you're using Viagra.  Stay tuned.  I hate when they do that.  Now what if you're that occupation. 
[29:00]
 You just took Viagra but you've got to go to work.  Yeah.  And it's like hey wait a minute.  Should I call in sick?  I don't know what the occupation is.  Maybe it's me.  The news always does that.  Coming up we'll tell you what food to eat to prevent cancer.  But tell me now because I've got to leave.  I'll be around later.  Toys being recalled.  Quite a danger.  Three deaths already.  Tune in at 11.  And we'll tell you which toy.  And there's your kid in the next room playing with a hundred different toys.  You're probably going to save the life if you just mention it there. 
[29:30]
 Thanks a lot.  The news is so wacky.  But they said that Viagra is bad for airline pilots.  Airline pilots?  People flying.  What?  They have a problem when you take Viagra.  You almost go color blind.  I can't tell the difference between reds and blues.  So you have a problem with your vision if you take Viagra they're saying.  Yes.  Well the point I want to make is if you get to the point where you have to take Viagra  you don't want to see what you're getting. 
[30:00]
 Right?  You make a good point.  And why are the pilots taking Viagra before they fly?  I don't know.  That's scary.  That's very scary.  Where are they going?  I don't know.  That they need that.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Johnson from the flight deck.  Closing in at an altitude of 36,000 feet and my chween is blowing up like a blood sausage.  Right now if you look out to your left you'll see the Grand Canyon. 
[30:30]
 Beautiful sight.  Right now I can't distinguish colors in the cockpit but I can work all the buttons with  my love knob.  Which I'm doing right now.  I'm letting the flaps down and look mom, no hands.  Thank you.  Thank you for flying.  Gives a new meaning to the term cockpit.  Get that joke to Marty in the morning.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with the police. 
[31:00]
 We're going to send that one out to John Glenn.  Good luck Thursday Johnny.  A little dedication and isn't that a long distance dedication?  Isn't it Opie?  It sure is.  Godspeed Johnny.  Godspeed Johnny.  A true American hero.  Hero.  Scored back into space once again.  The oldest American in space.  36 years later.  Hopefully his droopy old sack won't smack him in the face.  Good luck.  Godspeed Johnny.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed. 
[31:30]
 Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  John Glenn.  Gravity here on earth tugging on a man's satchel all those years could you know make it a little  dangerous and the zero G's sort of ends up like a pair of those click clacks.  Remember that as a kid?  The click clacks and if you wave those around too much what happens?  Sure people were getting their eyes put out.  What if that happens to our shuttle pilot and he can't bring the bird back in because 
[32:00]
 John Glenn sack hopefully this won't happen so good luck and Godspeed Johnny.  Hey I guess what do you think they got ruled by the space shuttle for the little rascal  he's going to use his little rascal scooter and the payload section he's going to take  a little space walk on his little rascal scooter.  Too bad they weren't going to the moon because then John Glenn could be like the first guy 
[32:30]
 on the moon on a little rascal instead of one of those moon vehicles.  Tranquility base.  We are on the moon.  I'm a little rascal on my little rascal.  I can go out around the craters, come back to the lunar module.  I'm active again. 
[33:00]
 Thank you little rascal.  John Glenn from the moon.  From the moon yes.  We're getting influenced by all these DJs I think that we're listening to.  Yes we sure are.  I guess we've got to play another twofer and then we'll listen to the next tape.  We're reviewing tapes that the boss has been getting from radio shows and personalities  around the country that want to take our job when we finally get the boot from WNEW. 
[33:30]
 So we're sharing with you some DJs you might hear on the show after we get fired.  And the next one up I guess we'll play this after a couple of tunics.  Give them a little tease.  It'll be the Randy and Claire show.  The Randy and Claire show.  This is what you call your cute couple.  Morning show.  Where they act like they might be married.  Yeah you never know.  They might be married.  Maybe they're not.  They're more like radio's version of Regis and Kathie Lee. 
[34:00]
 Look at this.  Randy was born in 1949.  Claire was born in 1975.  Oh hey.  Hey ho ho ho.  Wow.  I wonder what's going on there.  Not too much sexual frustration.  A little.  He said she said radio.  Hey Claire why don't you bend over and get me that cart.  Hey Monico Leweski have a cigar.  You're going to go far.  Until Kenneth Starr. 
[34:30]
 1027WIW The Rock of New York 2 for Tuesday.  Pink Floyd.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Everyone is calling about this Rolling Stones thing.  So let's get that out of the way real fast.  Ten o'clock tonight we got the world premiere broadcast of the Rolling Stones No Security Live Set CD.  It's going to be very very cool.  So make sure you're listening tonight when Matt Devotee's on.  OK.  All right.  And what are we doing on the show today Anthony because we got a brand new audience right now.  Yeah that's why I love the idea that we come out of a song like that doing wacky DJ's. 
[35:00]
 This could be somebody's first time listening to us.  Yes.  And they hear us being wacky.  And they think we're doing it on purpose.  No it's called sarcasm everyone.  We've been reviewing tapes that have been sent to our boss from other DJ's around the country looking for our job.  Backstabbers.  Yeah backstabbers.  There's a whole box of people that have sent tapes and convinced they could do a better show than Opie and Anthony.  So we're reviewing them and playing them on the air.  And so far I think our jobs are in jeopardy. 
[35:30]
 You know something.  I'm not even going to be the judge of that.  OK.  The reason for this is to show the audience what will be in place of the Opie and Anthony show if something happens to us.  Right.  And we've had Sticks Franklin.  He was a classic.  He hit big with the 8 to 12 demo.  The kids 8 to 12.  For some reason every phone call Sticks got was from a child.  Then we had what do we have next the Huckster.  The guy that thought everything was funny.  Marty in the morning. 
[36:00]
 Marty in the morning.  Every city has a morning show that has in the morning in the title.  Like in this town it's Imus in the morning.  It's the Imus in the morning show.  Where's Don Cricky?  Is he even still with Imus?  No.  He was with Imus back in the NBC days I think.  Don Cricky is doing some kind of like infomercial or something.  He's miserable now.  He'll see what I know about Imus.  I haven't listened to him in years.  In a long time.  OK. 
[36:30]
 Go ahead.  So now we're working on.  I even got a little resume thing.  Opie.  Yeah.  It's the stylings of the Randy and Claire show.  Randy and Claire.  This is the cutesy couple show a la Regis and Kathy Lee.  Yes.  Every town has to have one.  You're convinced that the duo on the radio is actually married.  Yeah.  Everything's real cute.  And they have the cuddly and stuff.  Yeah.  Let's see.  What do they say?  Are we the best undiscovered morning show in America?  Please listen to the enclosed air check and give your opinion. 
[37:00]
 We are currently in market 200 and looking to make the biggest jump possible.  Yeah.  Market 200 to number one.  It happens.  All right.  There's a couple things you're going to hear on this tape.  We've got to go for the set up here, Anthony.  Woodsworth, Louisiana, by the way.  There are a lot of radio shows that the talent actually sucks.  So what they do is they dress up the show with a lot of real slick production elements.  Yeah.  There's got to be like the song, the songs and sweepers and everything's like, whew, 
[37:30]
 whew, whew, whew, whew.  So if you're listening, you're going, wow, this sounds really good.  They got some real good elements here.  But if you actually listen to the jocks, you don't even understand what they're saying.  Right.  OK.  And another thing this cute little couple likes to do is seg the song title into their  rap.  It's easy that way.  Yeah.  Gives you your basis for your conversation.  Like we did with Have a Cigar, sort of that out to Monica Lewicki, that wacky little humor.  Speaking of cigar, how about that Monica?  Exactly. 
[38:00]
 Yeah.  That's how it's done.  So without further ado, here's Randy and Claire.  They are gunning for our jobs.  Take a listen and tell us what you think.  What?  Are they speaking in tongues?  I have no idea what they said in that first break.  Is that a code?  I think so.  The bombs will drop.  What?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[38:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The bombs will drop.  What did that mean?  I don't know.  But they followed up with some slick production.  Watch.  You know what this station really is?  What is it?  It really is K-E-Z-P.  Bunky Pineville, Alexandria.  What?  Yeah, the only morning show that takes you to the limit for you.  Bunky, there it is.  Eagle's coming out of Take It To The Limit.  Oh, they take it to the limit for you.  I'm recording on that. 
[39:00]
 Oh, Randy and Claire Shaw.  Randy and Claire.  Randy Reynolds with you.  Every single day.  Every single day.  Randy and Claire, 622.  You heard about those monkeys that escaped in Covington, not the Tulane Research Center?  I sure did.  24 of them got away.  Now, they're not dangerous unless you corner them.  Right, or unless they get a taste of nightlife on Bourbon Street.  Be careful of the monkeys.  Stand by.  We've got more monkeys coming up.  We've even got monkey music for you.  Surrounded by humans, the poor things. 
[39:30]
 Well, in case they're listening, we've got monkey music coming on.  Do we really?  It's a special service to the people.  Oh, this is dedicated to the monkey I love.  Oh, hey!  Is he listening to me?  This is Wednesday morning.  Outdoor's been your friend.  Oldies 104, that's a good sponsor for us.  Oldies 104.  Since we're kind of unwired, too.  626, I promise monkey music.  Why don't you sing that little monkey song that you sing in the bathtub, Claire?  I can sing my monkey song.  I had a little monkey, his name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to teach him how to swim.  He drank up all the water.  He ate up all the soap.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  Oh, my God.  The monkey song.  Yeah, Randy Reynolds here.  You sing that monkey song, bitch.  Yeah! 
[40:00]
 Sing me that monkey song.  As I spank mine, okay.  Yeah, I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, that's a cute little show there.  Yeah, sing your monkey song, bitch.  Give me that resume.  Yeah, sing your little monkey song.  We've got to call Randy and Claire and tell them that we've got a job for them at N.E.W.  that me and Anthony don't want to do this anymore.  Oh, here's the monkey song.  Yeah, I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine. 
[40:30]
 I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  I'm going to spank mine.  We're offering them the job.  How do we compete?  How do you compete with the monkey song?  We've got to step aside for the love of radio.  For the love of radio, this is our last show. 
[41:00]
 Put our own needs aside and call up Randy and Claire.  All right, it's Ranch.  Hello?  Hi, is Randy here?  No, he's not.  Can I take a message for him?  Yes, this is W.A.W. at New York calling.  We received his demo tape.  We kind of enjoyed it.  We're looking for more material from him.  Okay, who does he need to speak to?  That would be Vinnie Cutie.  Vinnie?  Yes.  When will he call back? 
[41:30]
 I'm not real sure.  What time would be good for you?  Pretty much first thing tomorrow morning.  We're looking for a new morning show here.  Okay.  I think he might have something.  Okay.  Do you think he could talk with a New York accent?  It sounds a little southern for up here, but I think if he works on his New York accent,  people will get it.  I think it's endearing though, quite frankly.  I kind of like that southern thing.  Would you be willing to move to New York with Randy? 
[42:00]
 Yes.  There's a lot of shopping in Midtown.  And how is Claire?  That's me.  Oh, you're Claire?  Yes.  Oh, are you married?  No.  See, I had erroneous information.  Are you the Claire for the Randy and Claire show?  Yes.  Oh, well, there's a little problem.  Okay.  We kind of liked Randy's part of the take.  I didn't know I was actually going to talk to you. 
[42:30]
 I think Claire's endearing.  Are you going to make a coffee?  Yes.  Well, I think we can work something out then.  Okay.  Well, I'll have him call you then.  Okay.  It's very cutie.  W-A-W-W radio.  Thank you.  All right, Claire.  Hey, wait a minute, Claire.  Yes.  Could you sing the monkey song for us? 
[43:00]
 I just want to hear that monkey song.  I heard it on the tape and we love it.  I just don't know if I can sing that monkey song for you.  I'm begging you, please.  It could actually be the difference between a job in New York and no job in New York.  Could you please sing the monkey song?  I don't think so.  Come on, Claire.  Come on.  Come on.  You remember it.  This is market one.  Numero uno.  Not market 378.  Let's go, Claire. 
[43:30]
 Come on, Claire.  That's how New York is.  You've got to be on your feet.  On my feet.  Quick to the launching pad.  When someone says monkey song, you monkey song.  Let's hear the monkey song.  How did it start?  I had a little monkey.  Come on, Claire.  Oh, come on.  You sing it for me.  Come on, Claire.  I don't remember the rest.  Please, we're begging you.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  That's not the tune.  With the tune, Claire, go the full distance. 
[44:00]
 I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to teach him how to swim.  He drank up all the water.  He ate up all the soap.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  Whoa, hey.  She's quick on her feet.  That's what we're looking for in market numero uno.  I think you've got something, Claire.  Why don't you guys conference us in about a half hour?  We'll work out the numbers. 
[44:30]
 We'll crunch some numbers.  Bye, bye.  Bye, bye.  I made her sing that monkey dance, that monkey song.  You sing that monkey song.  So instead of listening to Opi and Anthony, you guys are going to be listening to Randy and Claire every watch.  Randy and Claire show. 
[45:00]
 Ladies from Let It Grab its next.
