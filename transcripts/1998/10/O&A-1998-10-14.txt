 One oh two seven W. N. E. W. The Rock of New York with In Excess. It's Opie, it's Anthony.  And I guess we've got to discuss the radio ratings, Anthony. They came out yesterday.  Yes, what they call the summer ratings period. Yes, let's see. Which contains July, August,  and September. All right. A bunch of listeners have been calling and saying that we have to go to  page 73 of the Daily News, because no one has really told us how we did in the summer ratings 
[00:30]
 book. Let's see here. Okay, now last book we were in 21st place, right, Ant? Yes. As a radio station.  Okay, got the overall ratings in front of me. Okay, we're on the top five. Okay, we've got to be  in the top 10. We're not in the top 10 going down here. Got to be in the top 20, right?  I would hope so. That leaves us tied for what we were last time. Okay, we're not in the top 20. 
[01:00]
 Oh my God. Got to be a tight ball. Wait a minute. Oh my Lord. I guess we didn't hit number one.  Oh my God. What happened? Well, look at that. Ladies and gentlemen, last place. We're in last  place. All right. We are in last place, everyone. All right. We are in last place. We went from 
[01:30]
 21st place to 24th place. Wow. There are stations on this list that are beating us that I've never  heard of. I was born and raised on Long Island, born in Queens actually. And there are radio  stations here that have never heard of. Like what's WCAA? Never heard of it. What is WADO? 
[02:00]
 Never heard of it. Huh. How about that? How about that OP? WAXQ. Never heard of them.  Let's see. We need to play Spanish music. And a bunch of these stations don't even speak English  and they beat us. Where's Joe Pesci's Spanish song? Maybe if we play that, we'll get some ratings  because Mega. That station, what is that? Mega? Yeah. They're number one. And they are 100% 
[02:30]
 Spanish language. Well, 80% Spanish. Oh, get out of here. 80% Spanish. When have you ever heard  English on that station? Never. What is the other 20% you're talking about when they go,  David, what are we doing about Madison Square Garden? Is that it? Pretty much. Come on, Gary.  We're celebrating. Hey, how you doing? Hey, Gary. That's ought to be easy to sell, huh? 
[03:00]
 Yeah, we got Gary Blumman. He's the sales guy. He has to sell these ratings. So how do you feel  today? So for the people listening, he'll probably be calling you directly. He could do that.  We're still going to waste it. All right. Gary, I guess doesn't know how to use a microphone,  but that's okay. Doesn't matter because no one's listening. Doesn't matter. You know,  I think we got to celebrate the fact that we came in last place today. Yeah. I think someone has to  send us a cake. We want a last place cake. We need a last place cake. We need strippers. Party 
[03:30]
 favors. We need to party today. I want a hat and one of those little horn things that you blow on  the paper goes, woo! Oh, you want it like a New Year's thing? Yeah, like a birthday thing. All  right. Rick, could you go out and get us some party favors? Yeah, we're going to have a we're  in last place party today. We're in last place party. We need strippers. We need a cake.  What else? What else can we have? Everything that you would have for a party we need. Okay.  We need some beers. We have officially become the underdogs of New York. That's it. We are truly 
[04:00]
 the underdogs. It doesn't get any worse than this today. We are in dead last place. Dead last place.  We're almost off the chart. The little radio that the limo guys use has more listeners than us.  Exactly. You know when they call up, just picked up on 57 going to the Madison Square Garden.  He had more listeners than we have. Yeah, I noticed a couple cabbies in here that made 
[04:30]
 the ratings actually. See, I thought those were radio stations. They're actually last names of  cabbies. So if you want to call us and congratulate us on finishing in last place, we would really like  to hear from you today. 212-757-1027. Also want to thank David Hinkley for pointing it out.  Thanks David. In the Daily News. You're a pal. Let's see. What is he right?  NW slipped a bit as did afternoon host Opie and Anthony. I slipped a bit, Opie. 
[05:00]
 This is great. I feel great today. This is fun. Last place is what it's all about. Last place,  baby. Well, we got to climb up. Yes. Now we have to climb up. But we will be throwing our last place  party today. That's it. We're having our last place party. So send a cake. We'll give your business 
[05:30]
 a plug. No one will hear the plug, but that's okay. We need noisemakers. Noisemakers, party hats.  Yes. Balloons. I don't know. Rick, take the cell phone. No. Take the cell phone and call us from  the streets. All right. You've got to get some noisemakers and stuff. And we'll go to the phones  next because look at all the people that want to congratulate us on our last place finish,  Anthony. Well, ten lines ringing. I would say that is every listener we have is calling in right now. 
[06:00]
 Hi, NW. How are you doing? Good. What's up? I don't know my turn to do your show every day.  I don't understand what the problem is. No problem. We're in last place. Yeah, I know. What's the  problem? I love being the underdog. This is great. Who are you kidding? Come on, man. I mean, you've  got to finish your show sometimes than Howard. Well, this is New York, man. People love underdogs.  So we're in a perfect position right now. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, Anthony, are you going to 
[06:30]
 start taking Spanish lessons? Yeah, really, really. That'll work. I hear you. All right, man.  I think what the problem is, maybe we are funny, but the people listening just don't understand  English. So we got to start telling our jokes in Spanish. No sense of humor. What can I say?  We don't have a marketing budget here, actually. Say it again? We don't have a marketing budget.  We're supposed to have our faces on the side of buses. I think we'll just settle for the guys in 
[07:00]
 Washington Heights putting soap on the back of their windows. Really? That's just too cool.  All right, man. You guys had it. I'll see you later. All right, brother. This is very cool.  Everyone calling in to congratulate us on our last place finish, Anthony. Yeah, I like that.  We're in 24th place down from 21st place. Last book. It's just the bottom of the barrel. That's  it. That's the last. If you look in the papers, it's the last spot that a station is at. 
[07:30]
 That's it. There's no more stations under us. So I think officially this is the bottom. Should  we knock on wood or something? I don't know. I don't know. They might have to come up with 26  if another station pops in. We'll get a ton of faxes too. I'm surprised you guys ranked that  high. Roland from NYC. Hey, thanks, man. Thanks, Roland. Thanks for the support. We appreciate it  this point. Hey, and where's our cake? We've got to celebrate the fact that we're in last place. 
[08:00]
 Yeah. I don't see a cake coming from the door. I think the problem is that all the bakeries  aren't listening to us. So Anthony, I think you should go to the window and scream for a cake.  We need one. We've got more listeners. Yeah, I do believe we would. Okay. We could do that.  Wait a minute. Because if we're going to celebrate the fact we're in last place,  we need a cake. We need dancing girls. We need noisemakers. Hey, we need a cake up here.  We're in last place. Are they looking at you funny yet? Yeah. Get us a cake. We're losers. 
[08:30]
 What are they to do? I don't know. I think those are the people that listen to mega. Oh, really?  Yeah. They didn't understand you either? Okay. No speaking. Well, the phones are continuing to  ring here. 212-757-1027 if you want to congratulate us this afternoon. We'd appreciate that. Also,  some great rock and roll on the way if you care. We've got the clash in R.E.M. next. 1027 WNDW, 
[09:00]
 the Rock of New York with the wall flowers. Heroes. It's Opie and Anthony, your last place  radio station. Yeah, if you're just tuning in, it's official. It made the daily news today.  WNDW is officially in last place as far as the stations they list in the paper.  Doesn't get any worse than this. Yanks going to the World Series and well, we're in the toilet. 
[09:30]
 Have your winners and then.  I'm a loser.  Yeah. I'm a loser.  So there's Anthony. That's it. Oh, we have rock bottomed out. So to all the people that we ticked  off in the last three months, well, we really didn't mean it. We were just kidding. Deeply  sorry. We didn't think it would go this far. We didn't think you'd come to a reality, your threats 
[10:00]
 that you would leave the station. Remember those calls? Opie. Remember this one? Yeah.  I want to talk to your program manager. Oh, screw him and screw you. We don't need you.  I've been listening for blah, blah, blah, blah. We don't need you. Bye. See you later. Bye.  Bye. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. You'll leave. Yeah. Remember her? Yeah. Well,  we're pleading to you. Please come back. Come back to us. How about this guy? Welcome home.  Hello? Yeah. Is this any W? Yeah, it is. Is this those two douchebags doing afternoons now? 
[10:30]
 Yeah, Opie and Anthony. Why don't you just get off the air? You suck.  You know? You guys are horrible. I laugh at you. We'll continue pissing you off and you'll continue  listening. Yeah. I don't think so, pal. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Yeah, whatever. Sure, you are.  Um, to that guy. Look, we're real sorry, man. Yeah, we really are. We just thought we'd  entertain some people after a hard day's work and, you know, works for so many other people, 
[11:00]
 you know, DJs and stuff. Yeah. Just figured we'd, you know, do the same thing. We thought we'd try.  It didn't work. So, yeah. So we'll go back to playing like Jeff Lortel and stuff and, yeah,  keep our mouths shut. I'm actually really good at music knowledge. Yeah, I am. I could do some of  that. And you could come back to us with your kids in the car, too. Yeah. Because we're not going  to be doing all that vulgarity. Yeah, we're going to stop cursing. Yeah. For now on. That didn't  seem to work. No, that didn't work. Matter of fact, none of the stuff we did worked. Should we do Rocktober? 
[11:30]
 Maybe me and you could start doing Rocktober. That's got to get us up a couple of tenths of a  point. Well, it's not too late, you know. It's half the month still to go. We could start that.  If we even have to go into Rockvember. Why not? Rockcember and Rockuary. We could do that. Yeah.  Yeah. Where's our cake, by the way? Yeah, where's our cake, damn it? We're in last place. We're  trying to celebrate the fact that we're in last place. Now, one person out there listening 
[12:00]
 can bring us a cake. We'll accept cupcakes at this point. Hopefully there is only one person out there  listening. Oh, man. I.N.E.W. Who's this? Opie, Anthony? Both of us. You guys are so awesome. I  can't believe you're in last place. Last place? Well, happy last place. Thank you. And I guess I  will have to say you guys suck in a pretty good way. All right. And I get so psyched to hear you  guys at the end of the day because I'm like, I spend all day in preschool happy land and when 
[12:30]
 I get out, I'm so psyched to hear you guys rank on everybody. You know, I hate to admit this at  this point, but I think we suck more than Monica Lewinsky. No, you can't suck that much. Thank you.  All right. Have a great day. You too.  I'm a loser.  1027 W.N.E.W. The Rock of New York. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Blue on Black. It's Opie and Anthony.  And the party has begun. We are celebrating the fact that we are in last place, Anthony. 
[13:00]
 Our noisemakers have arrived. Yeah. Give me a balloon. Our, uh, I need a balloon over here.  Our donuts are on the way. We asked for a celebratory cake, but we also got balloons  flying around the studio. I got the one that says sucking never paid so well. Oh yeah. Right.  I made more money as a caddy. Here we go. Oh, there we go. Oh, you popped one of the balloons. 
[13:30]
 Just like our ratings. Hey, can we get like a pinata you think in here? What do you say?  Okay. But yeah, mega, we have to get mega. They're probably hitting pinatas over there.  They're number one. Speaking of that, um, the listeners, they're trying to help us out because  we're in last place. Someone sent this over, uh, the learning company, actually a CD-ROM,  how to speak Spanish, Anthony. Oh, that would help. That could help our ratings considering  the number one station in New York, um, speak Spanish 80% of the time. Here's another balloon.  Uh, there could be only one last place. Thank you. Yeah. We're number one as far as last place 
[14:00]
 goes. That's right. What other, what other balloons we got here? Um, we don't suck. We blow.  Uh, this is not what we're used to. Ain't that the joke. I haven't felt this in about five years.  This sucks. Yeah. Well, I don't care if the boss is getting pissed because we say sucks today  because this sucks. Well, you know, we got to, uh, try to crawl out, Opie, right? Yeah. And that  how it goes. If we have enough time to make that happen, Opie and Anthony last isn't so bad. Last 
[14:30]
 is cool. Don't they give an award at West Point for the last place graduate every year? Your place,  uh, in the ratings can't get any worse. And that's okay too. Think of all the fun last things there  are the last supper, last call at a bar, New Year's Eve, the last day of the year. So hang in there,  Mary from Jersey. Great. Thank you very much. We're up. What do you mean we're up? We're having  a party. We are. It's a regular blast in here today. You know, we're so pathetic that, uh, 
[15:00]
 we went out to get noisemakers and we can't even do that job right. Listen to my noisemaker.  Doesn't even go.  We even get the last place, uh, noisemakers. Sounds like a respirator.  Yeah. You got to go on. Yeah. All right. So our, uh, our donuts are on the way. We asked for a 
[15:30]
 cake, but we're getting donuts, but that's okay. Uh, maybe we'll get some dancing girls. Yeah.  That we will even take the last place girls. Yeah. The girls that all the bars turned down  and Hooters turned down. Yeah. Hell, we'll take the homeless lady on 57th and seventh.  Hey, a couple bucks to come up here. I want to see her strip for our party.  Why not? I'm a jingled change in the company. Not even a high, how do you do? No. All right. 
[16:00]
 So the party continues. Give us a call. Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven. If you want  to celebrate with us on the way, we got a hole and some Peter Gabriel next. All right. The party  continues. Yeah. Where did everyone go? I think they went to, uh, intercept the donuts before they  get in here. Really? You need a good cake though with icing that says you guys suck.  That's what I was hoping for. You losers last place. Yeah. I was hoping for a real cool cake  like that. That's it. That's our, this is our party. This is how pathetic we are. 
[16:30]
 A minute ago we had like 10 people in here and now we got me and act.  You don't even have a horn that works. Oh my God. Sounds like a sucking chest wound.  There's my noise maker. The Rock of New York one oh two seven W N A W that's celebrity skin 
[17:00]
 from hole. It's open Anthony trying to punch up the, uh, Alanis Marsett picture on, on the MTV  website. Why? Cause I saw her video last night. Yeah. With the, um, she's supposed to be naked  in her latest video. Yeah. She's completely naked. They, they have her hair covering her boobs. Okay.  And then they have like a, uh, just a blurry area. Oh, they cubed her thing. Not quite cubed,  but blurred out like they do on the real world. When someone's wearing like a Coke shirt,  you want to blur it out. They do that. And then she's like on the bus and she's standing in the 
[17:30]
 street and she's just like walking. And I don't know. I think the illusion was a little better  when she had a clothes on. She doesn't have a nice body. Very wide hips. Really? Yeah. And it  just looks real sloppy. Huh? Like everything looks sloppy on it. Well, I gotta check out that video.  Yeah, you know, there's supposed to be a picture here, but I can't find it. You can't find it.  No, that stinks. Where's our cupcakes? Yeah. Our cake, we're supposed to have a loser cake 
[18:00]
 or something. Yeah. A last place in the ratings cake. Well, we suck cake. We put the word out to  the bakers out there. You know, we're celebrating the fact we're in last place. See for yourself in  the daily news page, uh, 73. We're in 24th place and they don't list any other stations after that.  So we're assuming that's, that's the bottom. That's it. After that is CB radio where we're beating  out breaker breaker 19. And I think we're tied with channel 18 on the CB. It's incredible. Uh, 
[18:30]
 being in last place is kind of fun because, um, we got a lot of celebrities on the phone lines here  and they, they want to check in and, uh, congratulate us. Anthony, should we go to a few of those?  Really? Of course. Okay. Hi, boy. It's Bob Grant. Oh, you, you buffoons, you're hooligans and  buffoons. You're horrible. No wonder you're in last place. That's him. You're a cavawn. 
[19:00]
 Do you have any advice for us, Mr. Grant? Get off the air, you jackasses, buffoons with your  vulgarity. You should be ashamed of yourself. All right. Well, thanks, Mr. Grant. Oh,  how about that? Bob Grant. That's pretty cool. Huh? Yeah. Want to take another one here? Sure.  All right. They're, they're calling like crazy today. Hey, um, is this Honey W?  Uh, hi, Mr. I'm a Don I'm a yes. I recognize the voice. Hey, uh, you guys suck. 
[19:30]
 Not great. You know, if you weren't so bad, you wouldn't be so good.  All right, Mr. I'm a, there you go. How about that? That's pretty cool. I guess. Don I'm a,  I think we have one more here. Really? Yeah.  Hi guys. Hey, Pee Wee. You're in last place. Yes, we are. That's funny, boy. The girl. 
[20:00]
 Hey, if you can't beat him, beat it. Get it? Beat it like I did.  Congratulations. Thanks, Pee Wee. Wow. I'm honored. I feel special. I don't  hear. Yeah, just a little bit. All right. Well, the celebration continues on the way. We got  Joe Walsh and the Rolling Stones. Stay there. One Oh two seven WNEW the rock of New York, 
[20:30]
 Blind Melon, no rain. It's Opie Anthony. I do believe we've got some breaking news, Anthony.  Breaking news on the phone. We got Tom Broken Jaw. Let's go to him now.  Tom Broken Jaw, NBC Nightly News. This breaking news story just in from New York City. The Opie  Anthony show in the last place in the ratings. Hey, Tom, what's wrong? You sound really drowsy. 
[21:00]
 So I was having lunch on the street today and carbon monoxide from the cab started by  breathing in a little. Hello? Top story today, Opie Anthony in the last place in the ratings.  Ratings, Tom. Ratings, a radio rating. Ratings, Tom. In dead last 25th place out of 25. 
[21:30]
 Read them in leaps, gentlemen. Tom Broken Jaw, NBC Nightly News. All right, Tom. Hello? Yeah.  Tom? Hello? Tom? Tom Broken Jaw, NBC Nightly News. Hang up the phone. Hang up the phone.  Hello? There he goes. Tom Broken Jaw to break the news to everyone because I know we have 
[22:00]
 a brand new audience here. Going home from work. Yes, it hit the news today in the daily news.  Page 73. Officially, me and Anthony are in last place. Last place. Last place. It doesn't get any  worse than this. So we are throwing ourselves a last place party. It's a completion of with  the boss was calling phase one. Phase one. You might remember we spoke of phase one. Yes. And  that is the purging of the former listeners that didn't have an open mind. Yes. Enough to listen to 
[22:30]
 our show and maybe a little change in the music. Yeah, we've purged those people from the system.  And unfortunately, phase one didn't include getting anybody else.  So, yeah, we chased them away. So now we're having a little last place party.  Yeah, the balloons are still around the studio. Give me a couple of these balloons. I want to 
[23:00]
 play with them. Hey, Barry in Long Island emailed us. Granted, you guys are last in the 12 plus  ratings. That's everybody 12 years and older. Right. By the way. But Hinkley didn't list the  demographic you guys rock in. What's that in? Chinese takeout shops in Manhattan. You're number  one. You're number one with the pork guy. Okay. That makes us feel better. Very happy about that.  Yes. And where is our damn donuts? We wanted a cake. Hey, losers. Oh, here it comes. Hey, 
[23:30]
 losers. I knew this was coming. How does it feel now? How do you feel, loser? Last place.  Yeah, we're in last place. How you doing, losers? Pretty good. Yeah, it feels good, doesn't it?  It looks like we can hang out with you now. Yeah, on top of the world, huh? You're scooching on me,  calling me a has-been and a hack. And now where are you? Let me look in the paper.  Here we go. Contrary to popular belief, the Dice Man can read. Hey! Let me look. N-E-W. 
[24:00]
 Number one? No, a long shot. You gotta be in the top ten, right? Because yours is so funny,  ain't you? Let me look. No, not in the top ten. Let's go down a little further. Where you was  last ratings book. What was that, huh? We were in twenty-first place. Twenty-first place. Oh,  you was kicking ass, huh? Let's look. Twenty-first. Oops! You're not there, neither.  Oh, here it is. W-N-E-W. Twenty-fourth place. Last place, loser. You got as many people here 
[24:30]
 listening to you as came to my last gig and left your balls off. I think there were three people  there. Hey, loser. Yeah, we got it. Feels good last place, huh? Well, now we can hang out with  you, you know. You? You're bigger losers than me. Oh, you jackass. Look at you, you two snapperheads.  In last place, trying to throw yourselves a party. You're blowing horns. Get on the street, 
[25:00]
 you blow something else. Hickory dickory dog. Opie and Anthony, you're in last place.  It don't rhyme, but it's true. No more chicks coming up going, oh, Opie, I wanna make love  to a number one radio star. Baay! Down the road to the Spanish station on me. Who's in first place, 
[25:30]
 Mega? Yeah, Spanish station here in New York. Spanish? Yep, yep. What's up with that, guys, huh?  Well, they- Once you start talking Spanish. I don't know any Spanish. Say Taco Bell or something.  Hey, hey, Vegeta. There, you're number 22 now. With a bully. You snapperheads, look at you.  All right. This is all beaten. I know the feeling, loser. Yeah, we're gonna hang out together,  all right? I could do your show now, huh? Yeah, you can. Loser, I won't even stand here with you 
[26:00]
 two. You wouldn't? Wait a minute. I'm leaving. Wait a minute. The Dice Man is leaving. Wait,  you won't even hang out with us Dice? You're losers. We're that pathetic? Losers. All right,  get out of here. Wow, we're so pathetic Dice won't even hang with us anymore. He took my mic again.  I know. I hate when he does that to you, because I need some help when he's in here.  I can't defend myself alone. Oh, gosh. Okay, great. So- 
[26:30]
 Yell that by Dice. The party continues. It's an exciting day here in New York. Everyone's  celebrating the fact that Yanks are going to the World Series. And, well, we're celebrating that  we're in Last Place. And we're so pathetic that I don't even think the donuts are going to arrive.  All we wanted was a nice cake that says, congratulations on Last Place. Last Place.  Something like that. But no. No. Okay. Thanks. Well, if you want to congratulate us,  212-757-1027. Keep the faxes coming there. They're a lot of fun to read today. A lot of 
[27:00]
 people saying, I told you so. The fax line is 212-957-WNEW. We have a lot of people on hold  that want to congratulate us and we'll get to the phones next with that, okay? Great. Talking Heads  and Eve Six next. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. Steve Miller Band. Talking Heads and Eve  Six in there inside out. It's Hope and Anthony in the middle of celebrating the fact that we came  in Last Place in the ratings. If you don't believe us, all you have to do is go to page 73 in the 
[27:30]
 Daily News and they list 24 radio stations. And WNEW is in 24th place. Down from 21st place.  And Anthony. All right. We're number last. Yeah. Our donuts have arrived. Yeah. What's up, man? 
[28:00]
 What's your name, man? Tony. Hey, Tony. Thanks for bringing the donuts. Where do you work again?  Krispy Kreme Donuts. Yeah, baby. Pretty good. He brought like, I think he brought enough donuts  for all our listeners, Anthony. I know. It's got to be what? Three, four dozen. Three or four dozen  donuts. And we got to thank the fine. More. There's 12 dozen. A box for each listener.  At this point, if you want free donuts, come down to the radio station. You listeners of ours. Yeah.  So thanks a lot, Tony, for coming by and helping us out with our celebration. Do you like how we 
[28:30]
 decorate the studio with the balloons and stuff? Isn't it great? And what station do you listen to?  Something tells me it ain't any W. He's looking for the call letters. Great.  Ah, the humanity. You could be out. Why? You listen to Mega, right? Yeah. Yeah. All right.  You do listen to Mega? Mega's got a 6.0. Okay. Why do you listen to Mega? Some cool songs. Some  cool songs? Yeah. Do the DJs have a cool Spanish rap? No. No? Because they speak Spanish 80% of the 
[29:00]
 time over there, right? Yeah. Isn't Paco on Mega? Paco. He used to be on KTU Disco 92. Yeah,  now he's over there. Until he got blown out for, well, blown out. Blown, right? Yeah, doing  whatever. All right. Yeah. Well, we can only dream of a 6.0. That's right. But thanks for the  donuts, bro. This is how a last place radio station works. So consider yourself special. 
[29:30]
 Doesn't get any worse than this, huh? You'll make it one of these days. Well, thank you.  I believe we have three. Finally, somebody believes. We have three months left, actually,  at this point. Anthony, you were coming up with a pretty good theory off mic here about the ratings.  Well, yes, L.P. If you look, we are 24th, last place. Yeah, I keep looking at it,  and it's still last place. I thought it was upside down in that we were actually in first place, 
[30:00]
 and that Howard was in last place. Oh, right. Yeah. I know, but I got to turn it over this way,  and there it is, reality hitting us in the face. Well, last place, but you got to think of it in  special Olympic terms, Opi. Oh, no. We're not in last place. No. No, no. We're just at the tail end  of all the winners. That's all. We're just at the end of the line of all the winners.  So, we're all just winners here, Anthony? We're all winners. There's no winners or losers in this game. 
[30:30]
 Opi? Yeah, tell the sales guys that. Yeah, try to sell it. Look, they're in last place, but  all right, they're in last place. How does the sales staff go about selling our show now? I don't  know. How do they do it? I have no idea. They go into a sponsor and say,  Hi, you want to be on the Opi and Anthony show? And they go, well, what's it all about? Well, 
[31:00]
 they're in last place. Really? That's probably an approach not to use. No. Well, they'll come up  with some creative way to sell our show, I'm sure. I mean, we're making donut guy laugh here. So,  how bad can we be? They're in the top 24. Maybe that'll work. Who knows? But there's a  bunch of people on hold, Anthony, that want to congratulate us on our last place finish. 
[31:30]
 We look good with your party hat on, by the way. Thank you. I appreciate it.  Tilting sideways. I know. Well, I'm trying to look ethnic.  So, let's go to the phones and have these people congratulate us. All right.  Oh,  24.  You about as popular as ranch and pork. 
[32:00]
 Maggots that crawled on chongfong pork. And then you. Very funny. Good for you.  You're not. You're stuck. You're stuck like chongfong pork.  Got to go to the river. All right, poor guy. Oh, great. That was fun. The poor guy getting  us back. Yeah. Everyone seems to be getting us back today. Oh, there's another one here.  Actually, this phone call is coming from down the hall. Could be the boss or it could be anyone 
[32:30]
 that works here. I told you. I told you, you.  Oh, it's Tom uni. Hi, Mr. Muni. You ruined the station. Yeah, that's what you've been saying  for four months. Because of you. You two. I knew it. I told you, you'd ruin the station.  And what did they do? They ruined the goddamn station. Those suckers. 
[33:00]
 Hey, Scott, this station is so pathetic. There are more people listening to your pacemaker  than to the station. Yeah, that's the kind of cutting edge comedy that's going to keep you in  last place. Why don't you just leave now while the station still has a chance? 
[33:30]
 You told us. Could you play me some Beatles? Yeah, right.  Actually, I could play some Beatles for you. Yeah, play my favorite song, Loser. I'm a loser.  I'm a loser. They're losers. They're all those losers. All right.  I'm a loser. Come on. I'm a loser. 
[34:00]
 The party continues.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. That's the latest from Lenny Kravitz. That's Fly Away.  It's Opie and Anthony, the official underdogs of New York radio. Dead Last. Dead Last in the  ratings. Twenty fourth place out of twenty four radio stations that they list in the daily news  today. So we're having our we're in last place party. Our pal David Hinckley even acknowledges 
[34:30]
 that any W slipped a bit, as did afternoon host Opie and Anthony. We slipped. We slipped. All right.  So.  I slipped. Is that right? I slipped. Yeah, I noticed that. So I guess phase two hasn't taken  effect yet, Anthony. Well, Opie, it's very complicated. Yeah, here are the workings,  the inner workings of WNEW. Phase one was we were to chase out listeners that weren't open 
[35:00]
 minded enough to hang in there, listen to the Opie and Anthony show, right? Except some newer  songs. You know, shed away from just entirely classic rock. Right. And what was phase two? Oh,  yeah. Getting new listeners. Yeah. And well, that was the responsibility of you guys out there.  Remember, we told you a month ago that if you like the show to tell others, 
[35:30]
 we really weren't kidding. We really weren't kidding. See for yourself in the daily news,  you guys got to drop the ball on us. See, we did a great job of chasing the people away.  Hello, any W. Yeah. What can I do for you? I was just listening to your afternoon show.  Yes. I've been a 30 year listener. I've always enjoyed any W's,  a jocks and the music they play. Yeah. But these two are just morons. Yeah. And you should get 
[36:00]
 rid of them immediately or you will lose me as a listener. Care. Excuse me? Care. We don't need you.  Bye. See you later. I'm offended and I'm leaving and never coming back. Oh, you're not going to  leave. You're just saying that. Well, remember her? Yeah. I'd like to right now say I'm very sorry  to that woman. Yeah. I all like her. That call that we just laid into. Honestly,  Ann, I think we didn't tell enough Clinton jokes. It's working for Leno. It's working for everyone 
[36:30]
 else. And maybe we just didn't tell enough Clinton jokes when that whole controversy hit. We dropped  the ball on that. Maybe we should have broadcasted from the world's largest pop tar. Maybe that was  a... God, we passed that up and that was our key. Maybe we were supposed to do that as well. Maybe  that would have attracted some new listeners. At this rate, I don't think we're going to make  it to phase three. God, we didn't even have a phase three. No, we were hoping phase two was 
[37:00]
 going to take care of everything actually. Phase three was the book and movie deal.  Right. Well, there's someone on the phone here. Hold on. Hello? Hello? Yeah? Yes, I'm going to be  suing you. Why are you going to sue us? I'm a big fan of your show and I'm suing. Why? Well,  I listen to you at work every day. Yeah? And my coworkers hate you. Uh-oh. And I was in my cubicle 
[37:30]
 listening and they came in, four of them, my coworkers, and started beating me with my own  mouth. They caved my skull in with my mouth. Just because you were listening to us? They hate you  and your last place show. I thought you was going to be first place and I was finally going to go  with a winner. Yeah. But I'm with a loser and I'm suing you for being a loser and for injuries I 
[38:00]
 sustained. Injuries? From the beating they gave me. Wait, you were only talking about one injury.  Oh no, then the rest of them came in and they put a letter opener in my ass. It hurt. Yes, Al.  It hurt me. That's too bad. Oh, I'm very injured and my skull was bashed apart on my keyboard. 
[38:30]
 I still have the letters L, M, and K in my skull. The doctors could not remove them.  All because you're a fan of our show. All because of your last place crappy show. It was supposed to  be number one and it's last place. Even I think you're a loser and I'm suing. All right, well,  well thanks. Very injured. All right, have a nice night. Talk to my lawyer. Thank you.  All right. Thank you. Okay. Another satisfied customer, obviously, Anthony. Yeah. Got a 
[39:00]
 fax here from Paul in New Jersey. Now we went from 21st place to 24th. Yeah, that's what's really  depressing about this. Dropped a few. Hey guys, take heart in the last place rating. It leaves  more room for improvement. Last time you could only improve 20 places. Now you can move up 23.  Yeah. A word of warning, however, the big thing on that station now is the evolution of WNEW.  If you guys aren't careful, it could be the demolition of WNEW. I'd hate to be in your 
[39:30]
 shoes and be responsible for making WNEW go the way of the dinosaur. Oh wow. Thanks for laying  that on us. P.S. I'm a lawyer who can't wait to represent you when you ultimately get sued by some  ugly bride for defamation. You guys definitely push the first amendment. Oh, thanks Tony.  Thanks Tony. What a Tony's right. Phase three is you getting fired.  Well, I think that's the obvious phase three, Tony. That's what we were talking about. 
[40:00]
 All right. He doesn't like us. That's all right. Well, there's a lot of people that don't like us,  obviously. CZ Top at John Mellencamp on the way. 1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York. The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW everclear. I will buy you a new life in  Zopi and Anthony celebrating our last place finish. The listeners are into it. I broke my 
[40:30]
 noisemaker a long time ago, Anthony. It didn't work very well. No, we can't even like find good  noisemakers. Vicki in Peekskill. She's writing an email. I have two questions. One, does your boss  know what advertised means? If that isn't the truth. Does anyone even know we're here? I don't  mind if we were in last place because we suck, but if we're in last place because nobody knows  we're even here, that's really bad. Well, that's why I made the suggestion about a month ago 
[41:00]
 to have the listeners start advertising for us and start doing wacky things. A couple people had  some ideas and they did it, but not enough people, obviously. Because we're not going to get any  marketing dollars from CBS radio until we show them something. We're at the bottom of the  scrotum pole. We're at the bottom, so there's no real reason to pump money into this disaster they  call the Opie and Anthony show. And our second question, how did they get these stupid ratings 
[41:30]
 anyway? How do they know how many people are listening? Maybe those lunatics who think the  government's watching them through their TVs and radios have a point. I've always wanted to know  how they figure this out. It's a horrible system. Oh, well, it's very complicated here. I don't want  to bore you with the process, but it's pretty primitive, actually. It's arcane. But that's not  our excuse. I mean, we'll take our beating. Trust me, we'll take our beating. It's the system that's  been implemented and you have to deal with it. That's right. And we are dealing with it to the 
[42:00]
 tune of 24th place. Last place. You know how pathetic this was in all honesty? Because David  Hinckley writes his little radio column and he has to list all the radio stations, right? Yeah.  He had to start mentioning radio stations that he would never mention just so he could put any  W on the chart because this is such legendary call letters here that you can't just list all  the ratings and leave any W out. He probably would have ended at 20th place if we were in the 
[42:30]
 top 20. But no, because any W's status over the years, he had to start listing these stations  I've never heard of so he could finally get to where any W was in the ratings. Isn't that  pathetic? I mean, ADO. Never heard of it. CAA. Never heard of it. QXR. Never heard  of it. Oh, wow. AXQ. Never heard of it. What other ones here? Well, there's a ton of them. 
[43:00]
 So you know what I was thinking we could do maybe for Friday? What? We could get all our listeners  together and we could throw ourselves a parade. It's a short parade. How about we have a short  parade around the block to celebrate the fact that we're in last place with every listener we  have? With every listener we have. Granted, it's not many but we need to show some support here.  Our last place parade. Yeah, why not? We'll all meet on the corner and we'll march around the 
[43:30]
 corner. All right. Around the block, I mean. I'm game for that. I mean, every nationality throws  a party. I mean, throws themselves, us throwing a parade. Throw ourselves. Big balloon floats  like Bullwinkle or something. Yeah, maybe we could get a Mayor Giuliani float. Any politicians  marching in our parade? Yeah. What's his name from the monsters? Oh, Grandpa Al. Grandpa Al's 
[44:00]
 been begging to be on our show. Maybe he could march in our little parade with us. He could be  the politician. He gets even worse. How pathetic are we? Oh my God. The more and more I discuss  this, I realize how horrible this really is. Oh well. No, this is really good. Some guy goes,  you got to use the thought of positive thinking. Right. No, this is really good. I like this. This 
[44:30]
 is fun. We're positively in last place. I enjoy this a lot, immensely. So I think we should throw  a parade. We could do that last place parade. I mean, how many listeners, you know, listen to  a station that's in last place? So it wouldn't cause a traffic jam or anything, would it?  Probably not. No, of course not. Definitely not. I think the Mayor would allow us to  throw a parade. We wouldn't even need permits, right? No, I don't think so. 
[45:00]
 Just like a little like a group walking down the street. Yeah.  Light wouldn't even change if we had to all cross the street. Like it won't even hit the rough  track. It just is walking. They all walk across. All right, we got everybody. Keep going. Continue.  You know, this is don't know what else to say. Really? 
[45:30]
 All right, we got the Google on the way. Some zeppelin. Maybe we'll take a few more calls  before we get out of here. One oh two seven W. N. E. W. The rock. What's up? What are you laughing  at? Myself? The Rock of New York. What happened to our dancing girls?  Hi guys. Hey, we're here. You're in last place. Yes, we are. That's funny, boys and girls. 
[46:00]
 Hey, if you can't beat them, beat it. Get it? Beat it like I did.  Congratulations.  Thanks, Peewee. We'll send this one out to the man. The Rock of New York. One oh two seven W. N.  E. W. One oh two seven W. N. E. W. The Rock of New York. Georgia satellites, keep your hands to 
[46:30]
 yourself. It's Opie and Anthony. Looks like the Yankees are going to be playing the Pontres in  the series. Oh, you see the game over there? Yeah. Seventh inning pods leaving the Braves five zip.  Wow. I love that. Looking good for the Padres. A couple of people emailing Opie today. We had a  lot of email today. Yes. Steve in New York City saying, hey guys, dump the AM stations and the  stations that play crap and you actually finished in 15th place. Keep up the good work. Trying to 
[47:00]
 get his own little spin. Well, that's what everyone around the building has been doing all day. With  our last place finish, they're all crunching the numbers and trying to put a positive spin on this.  Well, guys, if you take out all the other stations that start with W, you're number one.  And AJ, why don't you guys go on Letterman or even on Conan? Conan sometimes even has bigger  losers on than you. Really? You guys would be great and it would get the word out. Very good. 
[47:30]
 And I'm putting my own spin on it here. Hold on. I got to figure it out, but hold on. What do you got?  We're in 10th place. Now, how do you figure 10th place with all stations that  um, start with 100 on the dial? Oh, well, here you go. We're getting down there, 
[48:00]
 getting there. Is there anything else you could crunch from this list?  That's pathetic. Where the dial only goes up to 107. Oh, 107. And we're in 10th place with all the  stations above 100. Oh my God. This is cool. I like this a lot. We love being the underdogs. 
[48:30]
 Everyone loves an underdog, right, Anthony? Uh huh. Why? Talking about starting from the bottom.  Wow. Oh boy. This is fun. Okay. Neil Young on the way and I'm in the mood to play some tonic.  Tonic. So we'll play some tonic. Okay. Stay there. This is the band Tonic,  a song called If You Could Only See on the Rock of New York 1027 WNEW. 
[49:00]
 The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW. Neil Young and Tonic before that If You Could Only See.  It's open Anthony, just about out the door. Metavodi on your radio next. Yes. Um, well,  I got the facts of the day in front of me, I guess. What do you got? We've been celebrating  our last place finish all day long on the show today. I hope you enjoyed it. For the summer  ratings book. For the summer ratings book. If you want to keep track over time, those books come out  every three months. Yes. Yeah. To the people that support us, our faithful listeners, thank you very, 
[49:30]
 very much. And to the people that hate us, I hope you had a very good laugh today. Yes. That's all  I'm going to say about that. They tuned in to gloat today. Yes, they did. And that's okay.  Okay. Um, this fact says being in last place in the radio ratings ain't as bad as being last at a gangbang.  Well, that's another way to look at it. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for that. So I had fun today. 
[50:00]
 Did you, Ant? Yes. Now tomorrow, we start our long struggle. Yes. For another three months  to try to bring it up a little bit. That's what we said three months ago when we were in 21st place.  I wish we were in 21st place today. Is that three months ago? Yeah. Now we're in 24th.  Look at Matt laughing. I'm not laughing. Yeah, you are. Did you have one of our donuts? Yeah.  Thanks for the donuts. Okay. Those are great. You know, you need, you need James Carville to come in 
[50:30]
 and put the right spin on it. He's been doing that on the Sunday shows for every morning. Get that  vein popping out of his forehead. You boys are better radio ratings than you think. Yeah. 40  million dollars. But you're just him screaming every week. Hey, did you like how we decorated  the studio for our last place party? I like the balloons, man. Yeah. Read a few of them. We suck.  What do we got here? We don't suck. Sucking never paid so well. Yeah. There you go. Worst of all,  with this isn't what I, this isn't what I'm used to. Right. Exactly. I like that one. There it is. 
[51:00]
 Reese's throwing them around. Yeah. All the crepe paper. We know what to do with. Wait, actually,  this is, this is me right after I found out that me and Anthony were in last place. This is not  what I'm used to. This is different from what my normal daily experience is. Be like everything else  in my life. So thanks for listening. All 10. Yeah. Well, we start fresh tomorrow. Yes, we do. 
[51:30]
 What do we got? Willie tomorrow. We got, oh my God. We're starting fresh with Willie.  Look at Opie, his head's buried in his. We got Willie Nelson tomorrow, you know.  Oh, no, it's gonna be fun. Shut up. It's gonna come in and he's gonna rock. I want him to like 
[52:00]
 sing a song. Maybe we could write a, we're in last place song. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah.  That's a very good idea.
