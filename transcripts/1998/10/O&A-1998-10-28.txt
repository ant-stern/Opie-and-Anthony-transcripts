 John has mellowed out a bit. He's a captain on the force. He doesn't like taking those  wild chances that Ponch used to drag him into. Then Ponch comes back after 15 years and joins  the force again, Opie. Now John is his partner again and he's finding himself taking chances  again. High-speed chases, explosions. Now in the old days when it was Ponch and John,  that was fine, but not now. John has a family for God's sake. He has responsibilities. Ponch. 
[00:30]
 So there was a little altercation in the locker room. Nothing compared to the... Sorry, wait.  Just give me a second, please. Nothing compared to the touching moment spent in the garage  with Ponch and John when Ponch tells John about the death of his wife and introduces 
[01:00]
 him to little Frank Poncherello Jr. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Oh, it's so touching. I missed it all. Tears welling up. Yes. I grabbed my wife and held  her so tight, Opie. I can't go on. Could you just finish the break, please, Opie? No, did 
[01:30]
 you at least tape this so I can borrow it and check it out for myself? Yes. Okay. It's  on tape. You can see it too. Wow. Titanic, schmitanic, Opie. I was welled up. I was welled  up. Ponch and John together again. Very good. Well, thank you for filling me in, Anthony.  God, that would be the worst movie I ever saw in my life. I was too busy looking at  Tyra Banks' boobs during the VH1 Fashion Awards last night. Oh, good. You get to watch the 
[02:00]
 good stuff and I have to research the show. Right. Great. Thanks. I was researching. Did  you tape that? We'll trade tapes. Do we need to tape the VH1 Music Awards? They'll show  it 20 times in the next week. Like TNT won't show the Ponch and John Chips reunion? As  a matter of fact, as it ended and they're rolling the credits, they go to a split screen.  On the other half of the split screen is TNT going, coming up next, an encore performance  of Chips 98. I'm like, encore? I don't see the lighters and stomping feet for this encore. 
[02:30]
 I don't think this deserves an encore. It was so good they had to run it again. Back  to back, my friend. Very good. Well, we're ready to rock for this lovely Wednesday afternoon.  Factsline 212-957-WNEW. The phones were ringing like crazy, but Anthony was very emotional  there. We couldn't go to the phone, so if you were trying to get a hold of us, please  call back. 212-757-1027. On the way, the latest from Hole. We'll do some Aerosmith next. 
[03:00]
 I'm like, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
[03:30]
 Alright, now I gotta find out what track we're supposed to play.  I never know whose fault this is.  We gotta find some blame.  It wasn't our fault this time.  Wrong CD in the wrong CD case.  Cause we get blamed for a lot of things so I want to blame somebody for something.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. 
[04:00]
 Last night we world premiered the new Rolling Stones live CD and tonight at midnight, don't  forget we got REM in concert.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and it's Anthony.  And while the Stones song was playing I looked to my left, we had the TV on constantly so  we could be bombarded with the latest info.  Just like home.  You gotta have it on all the time.  And they just had the Lannis Morissette video on.  Someone has got to tell that woman to put her clothes back on. 
[04:30]
 What are they going for?  I don't get it.  I think it was some artsy thing they were going for.  Like here she is cast out nude upon the world, Opie.  And she's singing thank you and whatever, right?  Hey Lannis, thank you for making me pew.  I had an impression of her in a weird kind of way.  She had kind of this cute hippie chick thing going.  You know, sort of like a bohemian thing.  But then when the clothes came off it wrecked the whole image. 
[05:00]
 She's shaped like a pear.  Yeah, she's a little wider around the hips than I had thought.  And they had to use a lot of cubes to cube out the private area.  What the heck is going on down there?  Are you saying maybe she doesn't wax?  I don't know what's going on but...  No bikini wax?  No, it was just scary.  Hey Lannis, what's that down there?  Brrrr.  She got your bonk and a leg lock.  I just don't get it. 
[05:30]
 Maybe someone should explain that video to us today.  I don't need an explanation.  No, we really don't care actually.  Yeah, I wanted to see it when I first heard about it.  And then I did and I was kind of disappointed.  Yeah, that's it.  She should have just went the distance and had...  Her hair was covering most of her body.  I guess that is a good thing.  She looks like Cousin It but...  Ha ha ha.  Alright, good.  A lot of participation today on the show.  Yes.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York. 
[06:00]
 Opie and Anthony hanging with you.  And let's take a look at the front page of the Daily News.  Let's see what the city is talking about today, Anthony.  Let's see, Daily News.  A bang up year.  Cabs killed 28 and injured...  Whoa, 22,000 people in New York last year.  Alright.  Right on.  So wait, let's do the math real fast.  So, seven people a day about are injured by a calf here in New York.  And our stupid mayor is worried about effing Thanksgiving balloons. 
[06:30]
 Ha ha ha.  That's true.  The mayor is now all freaked out about the Thanksgiving parade balloons.  Yes.  So let's see.  How many people died last year from the Thanksgiving balloons?  None.  Well, it wasn't one?  She didn't die.  No, she was injured.  She was severely injured and she's learning how to talk again, Anthony.  Oh, sorry, Opie.  Well, one...  So start your equation over. 
[07:00]
 Injured from giant balloons?  One.  One last year.  Injured from cabs?  22,000.  22,000.  Ha ha ha.  What the hell is wrong with our mayor?  Ha ha ha.  He's going to take our balloons away from us.  He's going to make them smaller and safer.  I say we make the Thanksgiving day balloons twice as big and fill them with hydrogen.  Ha ha ha.  And let's shoot off fireworks around them.  And shoot off fireworks around them and let's thin the herd a little bit.  Now that'd be fun.  Of course.  My word. 
[07:30]
 That many people get injured?  21,617 people in New York last year were injured by cabs.  One person by a Thanksgiving day balloon.  Well, let's see.  Let's go to the breakdowns.  Okay.  352 just got abrasions, Opie.  Yeah.  None of which resulted in a death.  Then we have contusions, which is I think an abrasion.  Oh, cacoot.  Yeah, okay.  That's like a little deeper.  Yeah.  Fracture, dislocations, 204.  Mm-hmm. 
[08:00]
 Resulting in two deaths.  Yes.  Wow.  Coming in with 46, it's burns.  Ha ha ha.  Resulting in one death.  Severe bleeding.  Oof.  158.  Resulting in eight deaths.  Topping the charts with eight deaths.  It's severe bleeding.  Minor bleeding, 950.  Wait a minute.  Minor bleeding, 950 incidents.  But it resulted in one death.  One death.  Should not be bumped into the severe bleeding category 
[08:30]
 since they died from it.  It was severe to them.  Ha ha ha.  That's a little weird.  Internal injuries, 134.  Resulting in four deaths.  Mm-hmm.  Concussion, 169.  One death.  And oh, amputation.  Jesus.  Excuse me, miss.  You forgot these in my cab.  It's my leg.  29.  29, yes.  Wow.  You never think of that when you hop in those cabs.  It's pretty scary out there.  You always feel safer in the cab, though. 
[09:00]
 But the mayor's more concerned about our stupid Thanksgiving Day  balloons.  And he's taking away all the good ones.  There will be no cat in hat.  There's no bugs bunny suffering succotash.  And he can knock down a building to topple on top of people.  We can't have that.  This is a safe fun city.  I've instructed my police force to step in,  draw a trajectory on any errant balloons,  and open fire if they seem to be endangering the spectators. 
[09:30]
 Heavens, tumergetroid.  You know, the mayor should go the distance  just to have hand puppets this year.  We're going with hand puppets and hand held balloons.  That's fun.  My son Andrew loves them.  Look at the chubby little bastard.  He's smiling like an idiot with the balloons and hand puppets.  He's as big as the Thanksgiving Day balloons, actually.  So the balloons.  Watch out for the balloons.  Mayor's now after Thanksgiving parade balloons.  I'm glad he's got his priorities in order. 
[10:00]
 Very good, Mr. Mayor.  All right, on the way, we've got some very cool Anthony.  Yeah.  1027WNW, the Rock of New York.  That's the latest from the Black Crows.  They are rocking hard.  That's kicking my heart around off their CD.  By your side, I don't know the release date on the new Black Crows  CD, but I do believe we still have probably a month 
[10:30]
 before that's going to hit your record stores.  But for the first listen, I like that a lot.  And we're going to try to get those boys in the imaginary ballroom.  I think that'd be very, very cool.  Sounds good.  So I like it.  I got to thank Jason from Union, New Jersey.  He emailed me a website address.  It says, if you guys want to see some picks at the VH1 Fashion Awards,  go to, and he's got the website.  They have a picture of Tyra. 
[11:00]
 Tyra Banks?  Didn't I tell you that she looked so hot?  She was packing something.  And that fine piece of ass, Jennifer Love Hewitt,  is also on this page.  But screw that.  I know she's your love.  But go to Tyra Banks.  I am.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Is that a solid outfit she's got on?  What is that?  That's what I was watching on the VH1 Music Awards.  And her co-presenter last night couldn't keep his eyes off her chest. 
[11:30]
 Look at Earl.  Earl, is that hot or what?  Earl, see a hot black lady.  Oh my.  She'd be a hot, like, blue lady.  Get out of here.  Look at that.  If she was a triple, she would look hot.  Wow.  Those are merely huge.  And what, she got an ace bandage around that?  It's like she's wearing an ace bandage around her boobs.  Unbelievable, actually.  OK.  You could get there.  Let the listeners in on the little website. 
[12:00]
 Oh, big.  Yeah, because they've got to see what I saw last night.  All right.  It's www.scoopyscoopyscoopy.net.  And then slash daily slash HTM.  You get to it from the scoopy.net though, I'm sure.  Tell a coopy.  Tell us what you think of Tyra.  There's another picture of her too.  That's just bizarre.  This person got the picture off the video of her being interviewed by Entertainment Tonight. 
[12:30]
 Mm-hmm.  Oh, look at that.  How did this guy maintain eye contact with her?  There's just bulging out from that ace bandage she's wearing as a top.  And there's Tyra.  Excuse me, sir, you're staring at the wrong eyes.  Why?  You're staring at my other eye.  All right.  Hey, yeah, we got more chips audio.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  What was the intense blood scene all about from last night's episode? 
[13:00]
 Intense blood scene?  Nobody.  There's no blood in chips.  Do they have to like run some blood to the hospital or something?  There is an emergency.  Oh, you're right.  And was that a good scene?  Is it worth playing or no?  Oh, probably not.  I don't think anything's worth playing from chips.  Well, you said earlier that you really enjoyed the chips movie last night.  I was lying.  Oh.  Did you take sarcasm that I was getting all choked up at the reunion?  But I thought you really liked it. 
[13:30]
 It was had to be the worst movie ever.  OK.  I sat through it watching it like some people listen to our show,  where it's just like, I hate this.  It's horrible.  I can't believe I'm watching this, but I'll continue.  Yeah.  That's how people think of our show.  Well, let's take a listen to chips.  OK.  Action packed music.  I'm here for the type of R.H. negative planet.  Headed for UCLA. 
[14:00]
 I can't keep your blood just like that.  What kinds of paperwork do you have?  Paperwork?  There's no time for paperwork.  My friend's a cop who had an on duty accident.  He needs that blood now.  I could lose my job for this.  You're going to lose a lot more than your job.  You're going to give me a blood.  Oh.  Yeah.  Come on.  I'm doing all the paperwork on this thing.  Good.  I'll sign whatever it is you want.  Later.  Thanks.  Yeah.  That's right.  Hodge pulled over an ambulance.  And then he gets a helicopter to pull him out of the traffic jam in a harness. 
[14:30]
 That was some great acting.  Why didn't you like the show last night?  Hey.  You're going to be a great actor.  I'm going to be a great actor.  That was some great acting.  Why didn't you like the show last night?  Hey.  You give it to me or you're going to have a problem.  What?  You're going to bite me with those big, chiclet teeth you got?  Does his teeth look like those big white chiclets that you buy?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Sumo wrestle me if I don't give you the blood? 
[15:00]
 Draw out a ring and hit me with that gut.  All right.  Very good.  That was a touching, touching episode.  Obviously it.  And I was corrected.  It's Chips 99, not Chips 98.  Why?  I don't know.  Perhaps TNT is running it nonstop until 1999.  They're going to run it every day until 1999.  Oh, big people riding in on the instant feedback  with their favorite chips moments from last night's Chips 99.  One girl was writing in that she couldn't stop laughing at the scene 
[15:30]
 where Panch was hanging from the helicopter with a cooler full of blood  en route to the hospital.  A la Rambo?  Yeah.  He was actually in a harness that was connected to the helicopter just in midair.  And he's talking to the pilot.  Yeah.  Through his little headset.  All right.  Get me to the hospital.  He's swinging in the breeze over Los Angeles.  This is hysterical.  What a messed up show last night. 
[16:00]
 Blue on black, Kenny Wayne Shepard on the Rock of New York, 1027WNW.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Facts is rolling in here at 212-957-WNW.  This one reads, you two kill me.  I bet if it was the same chip show but starring Tyra Banks and Jennifer Love  Hewitt, you would have loved it.  Well, yeah, of course.  Don't be silly.  You're just jealous because though Eric and Larry might be older and fatter,  they're still better looking than both of you.  Oh, you got me. 
[16:30]
 Oh, you got us.  We're not jealous.  That was a mess last night.  It's funny because a few of the ladies are coming out of the woodwork saying it was  probably the worst show in TV history last night.  Could have been.  But there are a lot of ladies calling up and saying, come on, man.  That wasn't that bad.  One woman called John still looks good.  Looks like my grandfather, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They really didn't need to make that show last night. 
[17:00]
 Guys, did you notice that the helicopter scene from Chips 99 was remarkably similar to the  process in which you transport a beached whale?  Just an observation.  Are they trying to get ponds to a sea world?  Keep this blowhole wet.  Well, I think we have another touching moment from the Chips movie already set to go here.  Anthony, you want to set this one up for us?  Because I honestly did not see the movie.  I was too busy watching the VH1 Fashion Awards last night. 
[17:30]
 Yes, I'll be there.  It was, I would say, a 5CleanX movie.  I was choked up a little last night with the reunion between Ponch and John, the trials  and tribulations, and this scene, which was just devastating.  This was a hard scene to sit through.  Heart wrenching?  Yes, I'll be there.  Did I just play it, Anthony?  It's the scene where Ponch tells John about his wife. 
[18:00]
 Oh, okay.  You know how it is with wives.  I did.  I did?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I'm welling up.  Frankie was two years old when Carol died.  Oh! 
[18:30]
 Sorry.  It was rough.  I remember when you met her.  What a mess.  I don't remember the guffaws and laughter through that as I watched the last night opening.  I think that was actually audio of you watching the Chips movie last night, Anthony. 
[19:00]
 That's what that was all about.  What happened to the roller disco episode?  That's what I liked.  Honestly, if someone has that on tape, Anthony and I are looking for that.  Please send it in.  We'll give you an N.E.W. prize package because we saw this a couple years ago where I had  to call Anthony and get him on the phone so we could goof on this episode together.  This is a Chips episode to see.  It's Ponch and John chasing a roving gang of bank robbers on roller skates.  For some reason, remember back in the 70s, there was the big roller skating fad, you 
[19:30]
 know, with those big, not the roller blades, I'm talking the big bulky wheeled roller skates.  And the bank robbers had these skates in these big platform shoes and they would rob the  bank, push this button on the heel and the wheels would pop down and they'd skate away  for their escape.  Why not just use an escape car?  But then the boys for this week's episode had to chase them on roller skates as well.  They couldn't chase them on foot.  They had to chase them down on skates. 
[20:00]
 There was this whole roller skating episode thing because then toward the end of the episode,  they were trying to get all money together for this big benefit where they were going  to have a roller party, a celebrity one, star studded.  And it just so happened that every star that they got was a star that was on the same network  Chips was on that year.  So I was like, you know, hey, here's the MC at the disco party.  And now making his way onto the roller floor.  Let's give a big hand.  It is enough Dick Van Patten. 
[20:30]
 Dick Van Patten, everyone.  They show him like trying to skate.  He's got a horrible skater, a couple of girls trying to hold him up.  All right.  I know going on on his roller skates.  Oh, it's Grizzly Adams, Dan Haggerty.  Let's give a big hand to Dan Haggerty.  Camp from Battle of the Network stars.  Yeah, they just introduced them one by one.  Oh, it's Robert Conrad.  Happy Boying Camp.  It's awful. 
[21:00]
 I want to see that again desperately.  We need to find a copy of that.  There was that.  And then my other favorite was Ponch's singing debut.  Yes.  He sang Celebration.  We're going to have a good time tonight.  Let's celebrate.  It's all right.  And he had this big disco suit on and everything.  Oh, he looked like a pimp.  He did.  He looked like Huggy Bear.  Huggy Bear.  Yeah.  And coming out on.  I am here for what the rules did to Huggy Bear.  Antonio Fargas.  Is that his name? 
[21:30]
 Antonio Fargas.  Something like that.  All right.  There you go.  We know a little too much about chips, don't we?  Unfortunately, we do.  Welcome to the show.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from Kiss Psycho Circus.  It's Opie Anthony.  And we're getting a lot of people emailing and faxing.  They're convinced we are behind the human fly.  Oh, my goodness.  We couldn't possibly be behind something so illegal. 
[22:00]
 Something as illegal as illegal.  Well, no, why?  Because last week, we were giving R.A.M. tickets away.  And a guy said he would base jump off the George Washington Bridge for the R.A.M. tickets.  So a lot of people are making the connection that we might be behind this guy.  Whoever he is, I want to give him a big, huge thumbs up.  I don't know what's ballsier, first of all.  The jump that he did off of the Chrysler Building or climbing down a fire hose out the window to the eagle head. 
[22:30]
 Did you read what he had to do to get to the eagle head?  He took what, like a fire hose that he saw in the hallway and he scampered down four flights to the eagle's head.  That is scary.  Well, he had a parachute.  Yeah, but the problem is he ripped his hands and burned them really bad because he just started sliding really fast.  Yeah.  We've all done that before.  In gym class, yeah, they tell you not to slide down the road. 
[23:00]
 Don't slide hand over hand all the way down. Don't slide.  But an amazing jump and he got away again, which is very cool, I think.  That's something how he fits the whole parachute underneath his jacket or whatever it is so it doesn't look like he's wearing a parachute.  And you know how he got away?  Cab.  Jumped in a cab.  Which is statistically a lot more dangerous than jumping off the Chrysler Building.  Exactly.  Isn't that amazing?  He could have got injured being in the cab.  That would be something. He jumps off, successful jump, four stories out a window down a fire hose and jumps off the Chrysler Building, hops in a cab and gets killed. 
[23:30]
 Because the front page of the Daily News, they're saying that cabs killed 28 last year and injured 21,617 people.  That's something.  I wonder if he's done jumping, Anthony.  Hmm.  Do you think he has another jump in him?  I think so.  I have a feeling it's going to be a bridge next time.  You think?  Oh yeah.  What else could he jump off?  Well, he wants to do the World Trade Center. 
[24:00]
 Yeah, the World Trade Center, but the security is really tough over there.  Too tight.  They don't have a sense of humor over at the World Trade Center anymore.  Gee, I wonder why.  Yeah, exactly.  Hmm.  I say he goes for a bridge.  A bridge?  Yeah.  Which one?  If I was a betting man?  George Washington?  He likes to stay dry though. 
[24:30]
 True.  He wouldn't need a boat to help him get away.  Yeah, or something.  I think he can pull it off though.  GWB.  GWB is my guess.  What's yours?  Oh, I'll say the GWB also.  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  But we really don't know who the guy is.  No.  Not at all.  So, enough said.  Okay, on the way, some David Bowie.  You know, a lot of people are calling in for the, they call my name's Bill bit from last  week, where he was in the phone booth.  Who? 
[25:00]
 Where he was in the phone booth.  I was.  I couldn't find my wallet.  That's right.  And you were calling for some help.  I was.  And you had a tragic accident.  Yes, please.  We're probably going to play that call tomorrow because I think that's going to be the bit  of the week.  I'm okay now though.  Because we're going to do a bit of the week tomorrow because we got to start the evolution  of rock on Friday.  Who?  Forget it, Bill.  But I think we have another little prank for Bill.  We do.  Don't you need a hearing aid, Bill? 
[25:30]
 What?  Don't you need a hearing aid?  Fine, thank you.  All right.  We're going to call a hearing aid place for you.  Okay, Bill?  Yes, I'll take it on ride.  Forget it.  Anthony Minespring.  Anthony Minespring, we need to talk about that for a minute here real fast.  Reliable, fast internet service.  I know there's a lot of people always looking for a new provider and they should look at  Minespring.  It's 1-888-M-Spring.  Why should they look at Minespring, Anthony?  Well, you're ever on the net looking for your Jennifer Love Hewitt pictures or Tyra Banks 
[26:00]
 pictures and it downloads like a curtain pulling down real slow and you get the top of the  screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top  of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the  top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you  get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen,  you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the  screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top  of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the  top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you  get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen,  you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the  screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top  of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the  top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you  get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen,  you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the  screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top  of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the  top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you  get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen,  you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the  screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top of the screen, you get the top

[36:00]
 Yeah, oh my god, the Scott so Elton thing is classic  He did a lot of classic stuff and has drinking without yeah, he drank with everyone actually. Yeah, so  Well, I've just been informed that Bob Hope isn't ready to come on the air yet. No, he's not I  Guess he was supposed to be the oldest man in space not John Glenn who's taking off tomorrow  Yeah, so I do believe we'll have Bob Hope on the radio in a few minutes here  Okay, stand by for that, but I think we're gonna take a trip down memory lane 
[36:30]
 What do you we've had hundreds and hundreds of requests for this little phone call that came in?  I think the first week we were here. Oh, wow this one. Yeah the Carol Miller call  Yeah  When somebody was calling for Carol Miller and we kept transferring them to imaginary departments here at any w  Yes with the help of good friend Adam. Ferrara.

Yeah, the big story today was that he's going up with Metamucil. Yeah, how cute? 
[37:30]
 Well, that's the old codger that's gonna balance him out. That'll work. I think the liftoff alone will clean him out  That  Had worked for me. That's got to be the best laxative ever  Sit you on top of a few tons of fuel and light it. Yeah  done I  Can't wait to see Walter Cronkite. Yeah another old curmudgeon  Yeah getting into the scene, but now I was reading today that they wanted but Bob Hope in space 
[38:00]
 Is there any truth to this Anthony? No, not at all. I didn't read that. Oh  Yes, Opie. I saw the same story  I'm surprised I didn't hear it on anyone else's show  No, John Glenn will be the oldest man in space, but who knows maybe in a few months  They'll send Bob Hope up into space. Ah, I wonder what that would sound like. Hey, I gotta tell you  This is Bob where the hell's the grim reaper? Hope? It's great to be here on the space shuttle  Hey that payload section is big enough for Charo's ass, isn't it? 
[38:30]
 How about that Brooke Shields?  Hey, my eyes are bleeding  Hey, is that a sunset or blood on my corneas?  I can't tell but I gotta tell you hey, how about that zero gravity? Yeah. Hey my ball sacks bouncing around like a hippity hop  Like I got a pound of melted Turkish taffy in my underwear  Hey, John Glenn pass the Viagra. I gotta take a leak  Can't even leak without my anger 
[39:00]
 My prostate looks like the surface of the moon. Ouch. Hey, where's Susan Anton?  Hey me and being are making a new film on the road to the cemetery  Hey from the space shuttle live I want to say hi to my wife for 70 years Dolores  I don't want to say she's dry, but boy that'd be a tough reentry  She couldn't get wet in the rainforest  Hey John, is that a black hole? I haven't seen a black hole since I showered with Sammy Davis jr. Yeah 
[39:30]
 Hey my eyes look like two flaming meteors I don't want to say my eyes are shot  But now one time in Vegas, I went down on Sinatra's toupee. I thought it was Dolores my wife  Hey, what's this mission control? I'm still working on bowel control. Yeah, my roads are hanging like tapestry  Hey, I gotta go but you've been great on the space shuttle. Thank you 
[40:00]
 Yeah, that's not an umbilical cord I'm using on the spacewalk it's my ball  So that's what it would sound like with Bob Hope in space, huh? Why why I missed it I was out of the room  Yeah, where were you Anthony? Oh, I missed it. I had to use the lavatory. Okay on the way  We got some John Mellencamp 1027 WNEW the rock of New York Pearl Jam better man  The who John Mellencamp in there your life is now from his latest CD  It's open Anthony and I've heard just about coming down from the Bob Hope in space thing 
[40:30]
 Was a fascinating huh? It sure was Anthony. We have comedy from Bob  Got a love when Bob stops by the ship of course  Just gotta remind people really fast here that we got the REM concert tonight that the voeys on your radio at 7 and then at  Midnight, we got REM in concert. That's gonna be very very cool  Anything else to say here?  No, I'm working on the computer. Oh p.m.. So what happened? 
[41:00]
 I don't know the network screwed up on me for a while, but I'm back. Hmm  I'm back checking your instant feedback at WNEW.com. Yeah, cuz the phones went out too or no one's listening to us  Well, what we didn't figure that option in maybe no one's just writing or calling us you would think  Broadcasting from any w in the middle of the day that the phone would ring more than  Once in the last two hours, yeah, I'm getting a little nervous  Remember the first time we came here. Yeah 
[41:30]
 We sat in on Carol's show the first day right? Yeah phone rang once  Yeah, well where we were from originally the phones would ring like 12 lines for four straight hours  yeah, and we we came in here and  We think we go so where do the phones come in and they go all right here this box right here  They ring right there that whole top row. I'm like, oh so  Are the phones broken? 
[42:00]
 And everyone got insulted  So we don't want to go back to that no cuz we're making them a lot of calls yeah, we're making progress now they're ringing  There you go  Hi any w  Hello hello any w turn your radio down sir, we got you live on the air. What do you got?  Well, they said you nobody's calling in so I figured I'd call it. All right. This is good  This is good. At least we know the phones are working at this point in time. This was checking it out. Okay 
[42:30]
 How's the highway today? Um, I'm in Jersey looks pretty clear right now. Thanks  Your traffic station w-ne-w. Yes, if there's any delays, please give us a call and we'll let everyone else know  Your name sir  We had it we had it  That figure you plunk a live phone down and what happens see it's not easy to talk without cursing  You try to go on the radio and and not curse 
[43:00]
 You got to put yourself in that mindset that you're meeting your girlfriend's parents for the first time  Put all your s's and F's away. Mmm for the day if you're wondering what that guy said  He goes I'm talking hoping Anthony. Holy waaah. Thank you. Thanks for calling. Please drive through  So I guess check please  All right, save for this way on the way we got you too sweetest thing. It's a Marrow Smith neck 
[43:30]
 All right, Anthony. Do you want to try the phones again or oh or you think they they can't handle this?  Those live calls they they freak out sometimes when we just pop them right down without giving them any pre warning or anything  Well now they're not ringing great  1027 WNEW the Iraq of New York. That's you too sweetest thing off the best of  1980 to 1990 it's Opie and Anthony. Why are you shaking your head over there pal? Well, there's one  One listener that we haven't won over hasn't over time had us grow on him. Just one 
[44:00]
 Well one so far that's checked in again  The other ones would be the left or had us grow on them for some reason this guy  He still feels compelled to write has an excuse for listening though. I  Am a very long time any W listener and have made it a point not to listen during the evening drive time  I did tune in tonight by accident  My finger hit the wrong preset and I felt the need to tell you that you have no talent and don't belong in any W  I've never rooted for someone to fail before 
[44:30]
 But you two have no talent should go back to some little 5,000 watt radio station on wrong island  Go away and it's from our pal Opie. You might remember  Mike Mendick Mike Mendick member of mr. Mendick and we said we made fun of his name and that's why he hates us  I wasn't making fun of his name you you forgot. I was being sympathetic to the fact that he probably is  Harboring a lot of anger from his days at school with the name mendic 
[45:00]
 Think of a young boy  Maybe fifth sixth grade having to go through school  Every day sitting there during roll roll call the teacher yells that she wants Mendic  And you have to be the guy that stands up, yeah  Mendic I thought Opie was bad in school. That's got to be bad. What friends want to go, you know, hey, where you going?  Going to hang out with Mendic  No, no young boy wants to say that to his friends so we probably had no friends 
[45:30]
 So he's got some anger inside of his harboring anger. We accept you Mike Mendic  Come to the dark side  He'll get there  He by accident he hit the breeze that I also want to say hi to all the people that  That like us now. Yeah, I'm talking to the people that actually hated us at first  I've seen those names pop up to earth's land now. I like that 
[46:00]
 Somewhere along the way you guys have changed your opinion and I really really appreciate that for having the open mind to  To let us grow on you stick it out stick it out  And we're gonna acknowledge you guys today because we have been reading the email and the instant feedback and the faxes  it always starts with I hated you guys at first, but  You're growing on but you're growing on me and it usually is a bit  One of these wacky things that we throw at you finally wins you over  And we just want to acknowledge you guys today. Thank you for for having an open mind sticking it out for sticking it 
[46:30]
 I like it and Mike  Mike Mendic  We're still here. Yes, if you want us if you that you hit that preset by accident  Give it a try again. I something might tickle your fancy guarantee. He just heard this whole rap Anthony  Okay, some people love to hate us and love to listen to us even though they hate us if that makes sense  Okay. Hey, can I play one of my telemarketer calls?  Which one you were brutal what? 
[47:00]
 Most people when the telemarketer calls the house you hang up you just say no, thanks. Well, hang up  Hope he's taken to recording these things and abusing these people to no end. Well, let me explain though. I  Was polite at first mm-hmm, but they call it the wrong time when you're eating dinner or  Showering and you tell them you're busy and they keep calling you over and over and over again  They don't get the hit. Yeah, so it got to the point where I was losing my mind and the only way  You know, I can keep my sanity was to start taping them and having some fun with them 
[47:30]
 Mm-hmm, and they continue to call to this day. All right, Anthony. Yeah, the listeners finally liked one of my bits  It's about time  Starting to feel a little insecure there. I'm going up laughing at your bits and don't worry. I'll be they finally liked one of mine  That's great  Feel a little better about myself now. This is really good. Thanks  Thanks for showing your support. Oh  Like I got some comedic stylings as well. It's it'll be okay. Very funny. Thank you 
[48:00]
 Rush on the Rock of New York 1027 WNEW. We're doing something very cool with rush  It's the world premiere broadcast of rush different stages only on WNEW  This is really neat because it's rush recorded live over the last two tours. That's gonna happen a week from today, right Matt  Yes, because it's gonna be on your show a week from today at  10 p.m. Only on WNEW the Rock of New York and tonight Matt Devotee's got the REM concert at midnight 
[48:30]
 No, actually you're out of here by then. Yeah, at least we'll have it at midnight  So lots going on here at any W well, I'll be you struck a nerve  People emailing us they enjoyed your little telemarketer scam. They did really? Yes, they did indeed enjoy it  That's really nice you guys. Thanks a lot and a couple of them asking if we had any more  I got enjoyed your last telemarketer  Scam I have dozens of them actually  Yeah, he's got no life 
[49:00]
 Got plenty of time to sit at home and harass telemarketers. Well, do they harass us?  Nope, not me. They've never harassed you caller ID  so  What does that do? I got a block on my phone. Also, they can't get through to you  Yeah, it's real pain in the ass to call my house  Man, I should look into that. I like to sleep but then I can't have fun  The funny thing is you can hear my morning voice in these calls  Hello  I did like 20 bone hits last night and you're like the first phone call of the day. What do you want? 
[49:30]
 I used to hate that when we try to call in sick to work and you have the morning voice  My eyes wake up late all the time and I'd have to call my boss up and convince him that it was car trouble  Mm-hmm, but I'd have to get right on the phone because you wait any longer and it's even worse  So I'd call up as I hello. Yeah. Hello  Hello. Yeah, I'm having a lot of trouble. Um, I could be able to get in for a while car trouble been up for hours 
[50:00]
 Trying to fix it  I'm just morning boys. That's pretty good  That was hard go with the fake sick voice then no cuz I'd use that too many times  No, it's sad when you're really sick and you do have to call in  Yeah, you feel guilty like they're not gonna believe me. So you always overact your sick voice even if you are sick  Hello. Yeah, like you don't even have a sore throat, but you throw that in anyway, I stub my toe 
[50:30]
 Yeah, it's like a blood blister  Oh and emphysema. No, really. I really am sick. I swear  All right. Well, we could end the show with another telemarketer call. Okay, which one? Well, this one's a doozy
