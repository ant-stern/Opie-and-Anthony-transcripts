 Mike? I bet she has a sister named Anita. Anyway, we got lots to do today. Yeah, we  do. As a matter of fact, it was a very, very busy news day. We have to talk about Al Sharpton.  We got to talk about Mike Tyson. We got to talk about President Clinton and Mike Lewinsky,  obviously. Powerball. Powerball. Now, did anyone win Powerball? Yeah. So? Yeah. Yeah.  No one. Yeah. Some older person? No, no. It was 13 employees from a company in Indiana 
[00:30]
 that won. They chipped in and got a ticket. So, yeah. Wait, wait. I don't understand  when groups of workers chip in and buy a ticket. How much is a ticket? I know. Why bother?  It's like, all right, everyone ante up 8 cents so we can buy a Powerball ticket. Why not  buy your own? I'd like to check back with these guys in about five years. Yeah. See  what the money did to all of them. That'd be interesting. But all the people up here,  snarled traffic up to Connecticut, shut down business in Greenwich, people spending thousands 
[01:00]
 on their Powerball. Ha ha. You didn't win. You lost. Right. It's good to see that it  went to some hard workers, though. Yeah, that's a good thing. 13 guys that worked their butts  off for a living. Very cool. Yeah. I like that. It wasn't like some old person that  only has 10 years to live and wins the $250 million. I'm taking the lump sum. Yeah, you  better take the lump sum. I'm going to buy one of those souped up rascals scooters so  I could get around on it. One with a better horn. That is a pretty lame horn. All right. 
[01:30]
 We're ready to go. 212-757-1027. If you got something, phones are already ringing. We'll  go to them next. And the fax line is 212-957-WNEW. Coming back with the latest from 7 Mary 3  and John Mellencamp next. 1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, the latest from 7 Mary 3 off  their CD, Orange Avenue, that's over your shoulder. Good afternoon. It's Opie. It's  Anthony. What are you laughing at over there? I'm having some of the email again. A lot 
[02:00]
 of people abusing us today for some reason. Well, NEW.com, go there and you could drop  us an email. Mark from Annandale, New Jersey. Hey, Opie, do you still have that cowlick  for you with that hair? I personally wouldn't mind having hair, but I still like to get  a little dig in. Well, if you haven't been on the WNEW website yet, you know, there's  pictures of all the jocks here at NEW, but in place of me and Anthony, there's our baby  pictures. Yeah. And when we first got here, I thought it was a real cute, nice idea. But 
[02:30]
 can we take our pictures off the website and update them to maybe our fifth grade pictures?  We ought to do that. Like slowly just put in maybe third grade and then seventh grade.  Because you know what the Internet's all about. And I guarantee there's some wacky pedophile  out there, you know, whipping off batches to you and I's baby pictures. Now I feel violated  just by you saying that. Thank you. Well, I feel violated. My mom, you know, hands over  these nice cute baby pictures of me, and now they're on this website and you know there's 
[03:00]
 nasty things going on at night with our pictures. Oh, they probably take the heads off. Ah,  I'm serious. Gee, thanks. We have those removed immediately. We want them removed immediately.  I'll give my prom picture. Which one's that? With my three piece tux. Aren't prom pictures  the most embarrassing damn things? They're horrible. You're wearing that, who has the 
[03:30]
 picture with the big velvet suit and the big wide lapel? Boy, I can't think of anyone,  Anthony. No, and that big bow tie. Yeah, I can't think of anyone like that. I never went  to my prom. You didn't go to your prom? Didn't go. Why? I had no use for anything. Oh, I  know why you didn't go to your prom. Why, Opie, why? Go ahead. Because you weren't even  in school. I didn't have time for senior prom. That was probably the reason. I couldn't be  bothered with all that pomp and circumstance at school. Right. You had better things to 
[04:00]
 do, right? Prom. Get out of here. I'm not going to the prom. Well, you didn't. I don't  want you to dress up unless I could have worn my little army jacket with my private stripes  on the sleeve. I wasn't going. Oh, we had a guy that did that in our high school. That  was my attire. He had to be the radical one. I'm going to wear tux with my sneakers. I  was in the back hall. I was one of the back hall guys. You were one of the burnouts. Yeah.  You were one of the tech guys. I was trying to get off and smoke a doobie. I remember 
[04:30]
 I got caught though in the back of the school. In the school? Yeah. There were plenty of  places you could smoke cigarettes or pot or whatever the hell you wanted to smoke and  not get caught outside of school. I went to John Glenn and there was a whole woods, woods,  woods, woods all behind the school. Could have gone in there. No one's going to bug  it. I had to smoke right in the alcove to the gym doors. So at one point I'm standing  there taking the monster a hit and the gym teacher, Mr. Cirillo opens the door and pokes 
[05:00]
 me in the stomach. I go right into his face. I get to the office man. I wasn't smoking.  You wanted the contact buds obviously. Yeah, I know. Well, part of the thing was you wanted  other people to see you doing something wrong. Exactly. That's why you didn't go to the woods.  It was cool. You wanted to take that risk because you wanted your peers to see you doing  something stupid. You're really thinking back, look stupid. Of course. Of course. Alright. 
[05:30]
 212-957-WNEW. We get a ton of faxes. That's the fax line. Someone asked for that so we  figure we throw it on the radio for you. I hope you know the phone line by now. 212-757-1027.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. Latest from Pearl Jam off their yield CD. That's Wishlist.  Those guys coming to town for a few shows in September. Unfortunately all shows are  sold out. I think we have a few tickets later on the joint. We'll be giving away when we  get closer to those shows. Yes. Someone who's coming to town as well is the man, the myth, 
[06:00]
 the legend Elton John. He's going to be at the Garden October 13th and 14th. This is  very cool. Starting tomorrow at 1, win tickets before you can buy them. I think we're doing  that all weekend for you. Tickets go on sale by the way for the show Monday at 9 a.m. through  Ticketmaster. The lighters will come out during Norma Jean. I do hate the concert lighters.  I do hate the concert lighters. It's a clich√© already. Yeah, but we all did it. I know. 
[06:30]
 It's just silly now. You had to do it at Freebird. You had to do it once at every  concert. You had to do that at Freebird. Big flame up full. Your thumbnail is black.  You ever have one that just goes like, poing, and self-destructs, the flint and spring goes  flying, or it just blows up on you? It's like a rocket in your hand. The last show I did  that was the Kiss Show when they were doing Bath. Bath, the whole place was into it. Yeah, 
[07:00]
 you had to do it during Bath. What a rocket show that was. All right, on the way we got  Queen and Third Eye Blind Next. Stay there. 1027 WNEW where Rock Lib, good afternoon,  it's Opie and Anthony. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. You know, I've got to ask people out  there in Radio Land if anyone else saw the homeless guy drunk, passed out at Penn Station  and who peed his pants this afternoon. Which one? Which one? Is that what the problem is? 
[07:30]
 It's too many. Well, I got off a train and this guy was taking a nap, taking a nap at  noon. Why not? Good time to do that is with all us hardworking stiffs who are trying to  make a living. He is completely passed out and there's a huge puddle around the guy.  Obviously, he relieved himself right there at Penn Station. The amazing thing about it  is hundreds and hundreds of people walked by the guy and didn't even look. Didn't even  look. That's New York, man. But if that happened in any other city, what would happen? There 
[08:00]
 would be ambulances. Yeah. People trying to help. Oh my God. They'd invite them home  for a shower and dinner. Yeah. In New York, no big deal. What they should do is put the  homeless people on the side of the road because then maybe there wouldn't be as much rubbernecking  people. They don't look at the homeless people when they're passed out, but if they see a  fender bender on the side of the road, everyone looks. Everyone's got to stop. Everyone has  to stop. So I'm just wondering if anyone else saw that guy today and if he's okay because  I was a little concerned. I missed it. I didn't see it, but yeah, I'm sure he's okay. All 
[08:30]
 the rest are okay. He just maybe smells a little bit. All right. Did anyone else see  Mike Tyson yesterday? Oh my God. They're showing the footage everywhere. This guy goes before  these New Jersey boxing regulators, try to get his Jersey license because his Nevada  license was taken away when he bit Evander Holyfield's ear off in his last fight. Do  you think his handlers or whoever you call the people that hang out with Mike Tyson,  handlers, trainers, whatever, correct them on what to do in front of these guys? Well, 
[09:00]
 he's got his lawyer, Anthony Fusto, and he sat down in this meeting with Anthony Fusto  at a very official looking meeting, little table set up for him, little cups of water,  the whole deal, and they asked him questions, trying to gear, I guess, his demeanor, his  anger, see if he could handle his anger because the big thing Tyson said was he just gets  carried away in the ring, but it doesn't happen out of the ring. Meanwhile, he lost it in 
[09:30]
 this meeting. Yeah, then near the end he's cursing and he doesn't want to listen to anyone.  It was just amazing. He should have sat there, had his lawyer answer everything for him,  and his lawyer's trying damage control. At one point, Tyson starts cursing. I've seen  a video. The lawyer, Anthony Fusco, reaches over and tries to cover Tyson's mouth with  his hand until I guess he realized he might lose a finger or two. He might. And he pulled  his hand away. They should have had a muzzle on him. Bring him in like Silence of the Lambs. 
[10:00]
 That's what they should have done. They said, look, look at him. He's perfectly fine. You  know, his anger is under control. And they're talking to people in Jersey saying, we don't  want him here. People don't want him because he would have to move to Jersey. He got his  boxing license in Jersey. Keep him out of Nevada. If he gets hungry, he could get a  jackrabbit. Come on, the desert. That's brutal. Come on. You know, the Daily News did a very  interesting feature on a lot of the guys that have won the heavyweight belt in the last 
[10:30]
 10 to 12 years. And there's only one guy that's normal and has moved on with his life.  Of all people, Michael Spinks. Spinks. Spinks. Because his brother Leon is a complete mess  living in a homeless shelter somewhere in, I believe St. Louis they said. But Michael  Spinks, after he lost to Tyson in that fight that lasted what, 91 seconds, he took his  money and ran. And he set for life. He invested well. He has a nice house, nothing big. And 
[11:00]
 putting his kids through school and stuff and his life is good. But they listed all  the other guys that have won the title in the last 10 or 12 years. Train wreck, city  all over the place. You know what the problem is with boxers? They're so, usually so damn  stupid that they have all these leeches that just crowd around them and drain them. Take  their money, they go in, they take the punches and there's an entourage of 100 people that  are along for the ride. Yeah, when you're watching the fights at home you think it's 
[11:30]
 so cool. Wow, look at his entourage. He's got 150 people around him. The fighters paying  for all that. Yeah. No one else. Don King ain't got anything. Don King taking money,  that's another sleazebag. Ugh, sucks. Oh, what's this Anthony? I don't know. I think  it has something to do with Tyson. And now excerpts from Mike Tyson's testimony before  the New Jersey boxing regulators as read by Alistair Cook. I ain't saying nothing cause 
[12:00]
 I be angry. I be trippin'. You know what I'm saying? Why do I got to go through this fucking  shit all the time? Boxing is where I'm at. That's what I be about. Look, I don't need  nothing from none of y'all. Yo, fuck all y'all. I just stress in my hurt. I don't need nothing  I just want to box. I ain't feel I gots to be go through this bullshit. Yes, those are 
[12:30]
 the words of the man, Mike Tyson. Wow. Bravo. Bravo. Can you tell me what you think of  Opie and Anthony? It's stupid. 1027 WNEW where Ruck lives, it's Opie and Anthony. We got  some sad news. Is this really true? Yes, Opie it is. Say kids, what time is it? It's time  to die. That's right. Buffalo Bob Smith, the cowboy suited host of the Howdy Doody show 
[13:00]
 who delighted the baby boom generation in the early years of television died of cancer.  Cancer? Another 80 years old. Another kids show hero dying of cancer? Wait, wait. Ah,  that's a good one. Hey kids, what time is it? Time to get Buffalo Bob damn cigarette.  Why did I do that Marvel commercial band in the 50s? I smoked Howdy Doody's leg. I 
[13:30]
 was so hard up for a cigarette. Howdy Doody time. Howdy Doody time. Howdy Doody time.  Ah, that's not how you do it. How about a couple of drinks? Oh my goodness. I don't  want to laugh at that. It's my childhood. It should just show the kids, you know, the  smoking's bad and stuff. All these old 50s guys, you ever watch I Love Lucy? They're 
[14:00]
 all dead of cancer and every episode they were smoking. Well most people are dead of  cancer at this point.  That's true.  Everyone dies of cancer.  It should just teach you.  Matter of fact, in the paper, give me news day real fast.  An old baseball player died.  Who?  I know.  Tim Tuttle?  Was his name Tim Tuttle?  Bill Tuttle.  You were going to say Tim Tuffell.  No not Tim Tuffell.  Talking about cancer, listen to this.  Oh no. 
[14:30]
 Alright, yeah stall phone replace.  Oh great.  It's on eight ninety five.  It's on eight ninety nine.  Grab your thing, alright.  Okay, listen to this.  Former Major Leaguer Bill Tuttle who lost most, he lost much of his jaw and cheek to  cancer and became a leading spokesperson against chewing tobacco.  He died at age 69 on Monday.  How could he become a spokesman?  He lost whole much of his jaw and cheek to tobacco. 
[15:00]
 Unbelievable.  Who thought shoving tobacco into your mouth would rot it?  Well they say here several of his baseball cards show him with a wad of chaw bulging  from his cheek and he got the best of them.  He lost most of his jaw and cheek to cancer.  That wasn't tobacco, that was just a tumor.  That was a big tumor in my cheek.  Oh and all those baseball cards?  Yeah, I had already stopped but it was too late.  Oh my jaw just fell off.  I'm going to pick that up.  Jesus. 
[15:30]
 Yeah so.  Oh I can't believe.  I can't believe he's dead.  Oh Buffalo Bob.  Dead.  Howdy baby.  Alright, alright and we got to get back to the music.  You can do your music tribute later. 
[16:00]
 Do your music tribute later.  Alright.  1027 WNEW where Rockland.  Hey kids, what time is it?  I'm a guy.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Aerosmith.  I don't want to miss a thing off the Armageddon soundtrack.  They have rescheduled their dates.  October 13th and 15th they will be at Jones Beach and October 17th they will be at the  PNC Bank Art Center.  If you're holding tickets for the shows that got canceled you can use those tickets for 
[16:30]
 the new dates.  Alright, if you don't want to go or you can't go then you can just go back to where you  purchased your tickets to get your refund.  Oh man, it's Opie and Anthony.  Speaking of concerts before you get into that.  That's a funny line.  NW welcomes Elton John to Madison Square Garden October 13th and 14th and starting tomorrow  at 1 you can win tickets before you can buy them.  Tickets go on sale Monday at 9am through Ticketmaster but we'll have chances for you to win all  weekend long right here at NW.  I'm a little ticked off because of that guy we just had on the phone and he wouldn't go 
[17:00]
 on the air with us.  That happens.  If you have a problem with our show at least allow us to put you on the air so we can discuss  this.  He's mad at you because you were making fun of Buffalo Bob dying of cancer.  I wasn't making fun.  Say kids, what time is it?  It's time to die.  That's all I said and Buffalo Bob died of cancer and I think it's a message to not smoke.  Exactly.  This guy is very sensitive.  Although he did hit 80 for God's sake. 
[17:30]
 Maybe you should smoke.  He hit 80 years old?  Yeah, he was 80.  I guess smoking is okay then.  This guy thinks we shouldn't make fun of certain topics on the Opie and Anthony show.  The problem is what do we decide not to make fun of here on our show?  I think we have to make fun of everything.  Can we pick things we shouldn't make fun of?  I guarantee if we put a list together of things we shouldn't make fun of then other  people will go, why aren't you making fun of that stuff? 
[18:00]
 Comedy hurts.  There are a ton of people out there that will laugh over and over at some of the stuff we  do but then if something hits too close to home then they are all pissed off and think  we stink.  You were funny when you were goofing on everyone else but then you said something that affected  me.  It affected me personally so now I hate you guys.  You can't worry about that, right?  Exactly.  Plus the fact that Buffalo Bob, wasn't he the guy with the cigarette commercial in the  50s?  Didn't he put a cigarette in Howdy Doody's mouth and sell cigarettes? 
[18:30]
 Yes.  A Winston.  Now the guy died of cancer probably related to the years he smoked.  Maybe, who knows?  You never know.  But Howdy Doody is dead.  He's dead.  Well, Howdy Doody is never alive.  Howdy Doody is almost like we lost two people.  Oh God.  Horrible.  the air and we'll pound it out a little bit.  Try to understand each other a little bit better. 
[19:00]
 Right?  Yes, sure.  It's a losing battle.  What do you got on the Instant Feedback?  You can go to the WODW website.  All right.  I thought this was pretty funny.  From Derek in Red Bank, New Jersey.  He likes the show.  Oh, thanks.  There's one of you.  It says, when three o'clock comes on, I'm all ears.  Kind of like Opie's picture.  You know.  That picture's great, man.  You with your little polka dotted jumpsuit.  You still got that?  No, I still not wearing that.  I thought you were wearing that yesterday at the station.  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what I was doing.  I was wearing it. 
[19:30]
 I was trying to attract guys yesterday.  That was me, yeah.  I went down to the park and I was like, oh, I'm going to be a star.  I'm going to be a star.  I'm going to be a star.  I was wearing it.  I was trying to attract guys yesterday.  That was me, yeah.  I went down to the port authority with my little polka dotted outfit.  I went to the bathroom searching for the glory holes.  Yeah, that was me, and that's me.  Geez.  Idiot.  You've got a velour top on.  I know.  I got the John Gotti look.  Oh, you look real hip.  That was cool.  I was cool in kindergarten.  Yeah, you were real cool.  Not much cooler than what I had on.  I remember I got yelled at because I got Elmer's glue on the velour shirt. 
[20:00]
 Oh, no, Opi, no.  I guess you're right.  Yeah, I was down at the port authority.  Shut up.  Jackass.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York with Green Day and Time of Your Life.  It's Opi and Anthony.  Daily News hit it on the head today.  What do you got?  Remember yesterday we were talking about how hot the women are in New York City?  Yeah.

[24:00]
 up with them digits and even the corner hey sweetheart nice form well let me hit you to a  couple of things this woman says women should be able to wear whatever the hell they want without  some strange walking up to them and treating them like they're on stage at scores if it's 800 degrees  outside I'm not gonna forego my tank top or a sweater just because you can't just shut your  trap a public degradation and humiliation is not a woman's idea of a smooth way to make her 
[24:30]
 acquaintance face it what women wants to tell a big burly six-foot guy is you know to get lost  but he's so big she gets scared and she has to move on the travesty is that these guys are the  same fools who are surprised when women don't immediately fall to their knees thank the Lord  for sending such a fine gentleman their way and excitedly hand over their phone numbers well we're  not looking for relationships what is she it makes it sound like if you see her walking down  the street right and she's looking good and then a scantily clad because of the weather that we

 and a few of the ants started calling the house pissed off again well we were talking about  weddings yesterday and some of the things that happen at weddings and I might have brought up  a few ants and relatives and stuff but I never mentioned names so all of them start calling and  asking was that me but that made it now now we're here New York all my relatives are here and they're  asking if I was talking about that you know we got to get fired again because it was so much easier  to do radio when our families weren't listening you know now you get phone calls what did you mean 
[27:00]
 by that I have to hide I have to hide every time we go home I'm like oh please don't call me and  then on the phone it's like no it wasn't you you know who we're talking about it's the other one  and that one calls no is that one well you were in rare form yesterday we got to replay this rant  of yours I was just talking about weddings well what happened was we were coming out of a Bob Seeger  song you know time rock and roll time rock and roll no big deal and all sudden it just got ugly in  here I just wanted to give you a phone call of the pork I know you know most people have been getting 
[27:30]
 on your case and stuff so I think you guys are right hey thanks a lot I begged you to tell a  hundred people for us I need to get some more listeners I have been telling everybody because  I didn't listen to any W like for like 20 years and it was getting kind of tired you know and I  have to admit I wasn't really listening on the way home and then you know during drive time it's  like two weeks ago it was like really bad traffic they're trying to get home from work and the only  thing that kept me from doing like a Michael Douglas and falling down was when you were you 
[28:00]
 guys were talking about that that one lady were you playing a phone call about bouncing around  ten times yeah I was laughing so hard there were tears rolling down my eyes yeah and then doing  the Moses thing so like I really needed you know a half an hour ride took like two hours to get home  well the Charlton Heston traffic will be tomorrow on the show yeah we'll do another one that was  excellent me and Anthony's goal is simple we're not here to be mediocre we're here to give people  a show to listen to on their way home where they're gonna forget about the traffic everyone has that 
[28:30]
 one show they listen to in the morning but on the way home they're all over the radio dial and we  just want to make this a place where you could come and laugh and forget about the traffic and  your nasty day at work I think it's definitely a good change and you know I've been telling me  the bits have been really good thanks a lot of fun cool I appreciate it just spread the word for  us because we're really gonna need the help welcome back and listen you know easy on the  chicken yeah you got it that was classic yesterday cool man take it easy alright brother later bye 
[29:00]
 right on I like it's about time cool thanks a lot for that okay there's one good one yeah eight  billion bad one we're not even gonna chance it and pluck down another light at this point look at  this little story and Landers it's about those lawsuits don't people get money for that a pretty  stupid frivolous how frivolous lawsuit lawsuits yeah all right 27 year old Michigan man complained 
[29:30]
 that a rear-end auto collision turned him into a homosexual and he was awarded two hundred thousand  dollars by a jury they actually gave him money 200 grand he claimed he became gay after a rear-end  accident claimed the accident four years ago left him unable to carry on normal sexual relationship  with his wife although he his only physical injury was to his back said the accident also had a jarring  effect on his personality and altered his sexuality told the attorney and the jury that he moved in 
[30:00]
 with his parents and started hanging around gay bars and reading homosexual literature and they  gave him money gave him 200,000 the wife got 25,000 now Anthony I don't know about you but it's gonna  take more than one rear-ending to make me okay okay I'm serious it's gonna take a hell a lot more than that  maybe it hit him right in the tailpipe wow that's pretty wild that's awful very good hey we're also  getting a request for the Mike Tyson stuff from earlier everyone saw the the news where Mike Tyson 
[30:30]
 losing it at that hearing he's trying to get his boxing license back in New Jersey and things were  going quite well you know he had a nice little lawyer there and everything was fine and then he  just he snaps and loses it starts cursing and then the lawyers trying to calm him down and he will  calm down he's ranting and raving the lawyer you know put his hand up to Tyson's mouth and then  thought twice and moved the hand away because he didn't want to bid off keep your hands and feet  away from the hopper at all times exactly so I don't think it's looking good for mr. Tyson now no 
[31:00]
 they were they were asking him questions about his anger and you know about the Evander Holyfield  ear thing regular questions that they should ask you know and they asked him too many times I guess  and he got riled up and started yelling anyone else knows how punch-drunk he is too that's kind  of tragic to not the Mike Tyson at all days where you could almost understand what he was saying now  he's like what well we got some transcripts from his speech at the hearing ah really would you like

[39:00]
 something first of all Bobby and Howard Beach thanks for the email get this which crime do  you think Clinton will be charged with very topical perjury obstruction of justice or  bestiality that's a toughie that's good right I gotta say I saw a Geraldo on Regis and Kathy  Lee this morning I saw that this morning what happened to check from the White House what 
[39:30]
 I don't know he doesn't seem very open-minded anymore he's defending the president yeah to  the end to the hilt I mean this is a guy who was supposed to look at everything evidence evidence  he's not looking at evidence he's looking at somebody else who tripped over his schween on  the way to success like he did yeah Kathy Lee's another one first of all she was sitting there  defending the president she had because yeah well she tripped our hubby tripped over his  schween he's another one gif yeah well same thing so Kathy Lee is defending him and Geraldo is 
[40:00]
 defending him her all dildo Rivera on the air just making up things that we used to be Clinton  supporters were saying he didn't have sex with him didn't do it he said he didn't do it he didn't  do it now they come out and start saying well what does that matter if he did it doesn't matter  and now they're even going so far I heard some people say that if he lied about it it still isn't  perjury how did that happen under oath hey you know something in my opinion well cuz it's the 
[40:30]
 definition of sex they're gonna go for oh please please if he perjured throw him out that's what I  say ain't gonna happen you don't think so no economy's too good and they're gonna drag this  on until he gets out of office he only has a little over a year left right I think they should  you know how these things go it's ridiculous we're already six and a half months into this  thing and nothing has been proven that's a lion's sack we all know that 20 indictments though yeah 
[41:00]
 yeah and half the people have left the country half the people die like the earth not the country  and now how about this also this is interesting now Monica Lewinsky is testifying now they're  gonna badmouth her and try to discredit her this was the same girl that when she was supposed to  keep her mouth shut Vernon Jordan Clinton's buddy is telling Revlon what a great girl she is and  how they should hire her for 90 grand oh yeah and a White House intern for nothing into a 
[41:30]
 ninety thousand dollar job at Revlon because Vernon Jordan's out there going she's the best  this girl's a saint she's wonderful take her take her she's she is perfect and now she opens  her mouth starts talking this whore this slut stalking whore whoev yeah whoev so who do you believe I tend to believe somebody who at least  sticks to a story Nunzio yeah believe Nunzio the new White House chauffeur is gonna come well now they got good for you guys now they got 
[42:00]
 Monica's dress too yep Monica's dress is now with the FBI doesn't even need it yeah it doesn't even  need a hanger to stand straight up so you know what I don't understand you know what I don't understand my god well use whisk protein gets out protein it wasn't the next day that she went public it was a long time what'd she do just hang up the dress yeah just leave it well yeah you know it's like Jurassic Park a drop of resin hit it we can clone the president in later years 
[42:30]
 we've turned this mosquito into a pterodactyl we can do the same to the president no obviously they have something because well they got messages from the president on her answer machine gifts the gifts that the president gave Monica he went could you give those back hey come on what is that all about hello happy groundhog day here's a Mercedes yeah 37 times that she visited the White House were on occasions that Hillary wasn't there she was out of town 
[43:00]
 well what a coincidence how about that and maybe Kathy Lee was there I wouldn't be surprised if it wouldn't surprise me at least if Kathy Lee didn't get a taste of that when she was at the White House I'll say it wouldn't surprise me are you saying on this here very radio show that Kathy Lee got some action from the president
