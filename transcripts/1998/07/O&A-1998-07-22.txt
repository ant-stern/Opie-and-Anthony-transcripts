[02:00]
 There we have I like Chuck and Sue a lot because they have a report  I love WCBS because they have the virtual reality set. That's very interesting  What I like most though is chopper 7th  Because there are two of them  You need two choppers to tell you that there's traffic on the white stone  That's right. You know why they have two choppers line so they could take a picture of the chopper taking the picture of the 
[02:30]
 Here's chopper 7 on the scene. Yeah taking a picture of chopper 7 to  Like Vietnam over anything that happens now people that's electronic journalism right there. I'm Ryan sound very bitter  You used to be a straight newsman, right? You know, I was a producer over at CBS News  What is he a gay newsman? I'm to be a great newsman. I'm just  working only on the gay stories  And I was legitimate is what you're saying. Yeah, so I just a illegitimate to journalist 
[03:00]
 What turned you though something had a turned you?  You know, I don't know toward the end of I worked on eye to eye with Connie Chung and there were some great people over  There but I was with the last story I worked on you may have heard something about OJ  Not a football player killed his wife  Something and they shipped me out to Los Angeles to do some hard-hitting investigative work  And after I was on my knees picking through Kato Kailin's garbage  No, you're bringing home the story and  I actually went out to interview Terry Mullis who was the big DNA 
[03:30]
 He invented like PCR testing sure and he I went out to his house and after we took a few tabs of LSD  We sat he's very active into psychedelics. He showed me some documents. He should not have shown me  I got a subpoena from Johnny Cochran and into a fight with a crew from like the BBC and current affair out in his front yard  Everybody came to fisticuffs and fists are flying and cameras are going and I said, you know, this is why I went to college 
[04:00]
 His journalism at work, that's right. I'm serving the public here. Yeah, I think that was the last thing I did  For them Wow, and now you're at Comedy Central you want to hang with us for a little while or what?  I'd love to okay. It's Opie. It's Anthony. It's Brian Unger and we're coming back with Dire Straits and the Jim Blossoms next  Dopey it's Anthony and we figured we needed some comedy on the show today  So we invited Brian Unger in from Comedy Central Daily Show. You're in big trouble from the Daily Show. Yeah, what a comedy 
[04:30]
 I watched the Daily Show to get my news  That's the best news. We are the most important show on television ever ever  I agree Americans get their news from the Daily Show then from any other source  Hey guess whose birthday it is today  A little special lady down in Washington Monica Lewinsky. Happy birthday Monica 25 years old today 
[05:00]
 25 25 years old Wow, she's too old for the Oval Office, I guess isn't she? Yes. Yes darn it  Yeah, very exciting times down there  I wish it would just all come to an end because it's all such a tragedy  But we have come up with a theory of course at the Daily Show about what's happening  Whitney Brown and I worked this up. Tell me what you think. I'm gonna run it by you  Kenneth star is gay  I  Think Kenneth star has had a thing for President Clinton for some time now. He's in love with the president 
[05:30]
 Okay, you can imagine he is pain  Knowing that he'll never be the first lady  This could only be a gay vendetta, I mean a guy who's been gunning for the president for this  Long  I've never thought of it. No, I think you're on to something  I live and he's tortured every day by it and the sight of Hillary Rodham Clinton just drives him 
[06:00]
 Very nice just a little theory we're working on. Okay. Yeah, I hear instead of 25 candles on her cake  Yeah, she's gonna have one eight inch crooked one  I heard this. Okay in the paper today and it goes to the left  Those files are sealed I'm not sure which way it really leaves now Brian closer to home  We got you need your take your your news guy about the Times Square incident the construction accident very tragic 
[06:30]
 Everyone's talking about it here in the city. Yeah, I think it gets all New Yorkers  starting to think about their fate here in this city because you really do go in the most  Bizarre ways here when your numbers up it's up in such a huge way  For instance, I know of a guy who was hit on the head by an air conditioner that fell out of a window and then split  His skull open he's now dead  I think that's a tragedy when a cab jumps a curb. It doesn't just bump into you it mows over eight people 
[07:00]
 And the baby, you know in the carriage and the au pair and everything it's very ugly only in New York imagine this woman  Meticulous apartments watching Sally enjoying her day  Thanking God she's alive. It's a beautiful morning little hot, but she's grateful because she has air conditioning  And she hears a creaking sound thinking it might be the wind or perhaps there's someone down the hallway or someone coming to knock  On her door. No, it's a giant  crane 
[07:30]
 Through the ceiling that lands on her for television and smashes her or makes her want  That's a bummer again tragedy in New York strikes in such of a way it's like a cartoon  That lady it really is. It's the far side  You have the picture of the window and the crane falling out right?  The whole angle of hearing the sound down the hall. Maybe she thought it was her grandson coming to visit 
[08:00]
 All them to be quiet so many times  And  No, it's a huge steel crane coming through the ceiling  You know sometimes things drop from from the ceilings here in New York like roach larvae  Or or this or a light fixture or something. No a giant  Is coming through the ceiling only the heaviest thing that could have possibly fallen on. Oh, it's just a giant crane  There's that giant crane again  Gosh, I hate we're a city on the brink 
[08:30]
 Mayor Giuliani would like to do something about the quality of life. Why can't he do something about those?  There's a start very nice  I heard on the news today, too  There they'll be shoring it up with cables and a big mesh netting so nothing falls on more people next week story  Cable and mesh netting fall on 30 feet right right right exactly  I don't know you want to stick around for more  Comedy here on the opening and listen to you guys you know I I think you I dig you guys you guys are great 
[09:00]
 Oh, you're the guy. I heard you man. So in Boston you did once in Boston very good you guys are great  Yeah, yeah, we were let's relive old times. Yeah, sure why not?  Sunday morning CBS  Before we leave you the sound of crane 
[09:30]

Remember put your feet on ice. It works in the wintertime  You know what I mean it keeps you when you have no let me when you have your feet when they're cold 
[11:00]
 You can't stay warm right it so in the summer if you put your feet on ice, you'll stay cool  I've been checking the elderly. I just cuz they tell me to on the news  Have you been going door to door at the elderly? You gotta tell me elderly. You are so kind  It's easy to check at the Woodstock Hotel. You just look through that big hole in the roof  Yeah, she had her feet on ice too  Now her body's on ice  That's horrible. Yes, very tragic  But we're discussing news with Brian Unger because he does some news for the Daily Show. Yes Carnival Cruise. What's your take on it? 
[11:30]
 Oh, I really you know  Don't go on cruises  Do not go I mean I know that it's hard to stay away because of the buffets right, you know  They say the food is so good. Yes, my mother went on a cruise. All right  She tells me that all they did was eat they're like cattle you get on the thing you eat like a pig all day long  There are there's buffets in every room in the gym. There's a buffet 
[12:00]
 All day long all you can eat but you know you get to an age in your life that that's the only thing you got in common  With your parents eating eating  Let's go eat in a sorry situation. Yeah, let's go to the MCL cafeteria  Well, you don't go over to just hang out you go over to eat of course  Yeah, what were you saying about the Carnival Cruise they did a piece on 2020 or something  Yeah, none of the none of the people that work on them can speak English, right? 
[12:30]
 So people were saying my cabin is full of smoke  You want to smoke you want cigarette what not my cabin full of smoke, where's the life preservers?  Hmm. I love the people who are already angling for the lawsuits  Yes, I did yeah I saw them and they're the news is only half so happy to get these people on TV  All right, you know and you already have the very sympathetic looking couple. They did not say anything to us about a fire  We were in our room. We were smelling smoke. We were eating at the buffet. We had no idea that was a fire 
[13:00]
 We're suing for 60 million at least  You know, I mean like they're damaged  And then the folks who had the home video camera who are while you're in the hallways, right, you know collecting evidence  Already, you know, no everybody is ready for a lawsuit at any time  That's what this country's all about now find someone you can do soke Carnival Cruise line. Yeah  Yeah, exactly. I love that stuff man, and they give you a free cruise out of it is what they do  Yeah, well those people are not gonna take the free cruise. I don't think so. I think they're gonna opt for I'm gonna 
[13:30]
 pass on the cruise and go for the 60 million  My polyester is ruined  Now I heard you were up for the magic show Brian why wouldn't you want to work with magic Johnson, you know  I passed up the honor  They're doing the work. They're doing there is so good  Just didn't think of myself as worthy  Magic is funny 
[14:00]
 He's clever he is the grim that stole late night and what's even funnier is his band  They're terrific and I'm so moved and swayed by the only  born-again Christian musician in late night  She's something. Yeah, they're doing quite a program over there  So I decided to stay in my basic cable universe and ignore the big money  I just could I mean magic literally he put his hand out and said grab a hold 
[14:30]
 I want to take you for a ride Ryan  And I said, I just can't fly with you today  I've got a little show to do over here  I was up for the gig and in the 11th hour. Thank God. We said no  No, thank you. All right, you're like the guy that got bumped off the flight that went down  I  Like to think that I would have quit a week before the show  Yeah, like I've got the sense to quit. Yeah see what's happening 
[15:00]
 But you are working on something called when animals go on TV is this gonna be on Comedy Central?  Yeah, that's coming, you know, we're promoting stuff a little early  But this is kind of September and it is a parody obviously of the Fox genre  All right when animals attack, I love that but I've investigated some very compelling relationships between people and their pets  You know and they it's really about anthropomorphism the sort of humanizing of animals and it's about people and their unhealthy  Relationships with their squirrels their mules their dogs and their cats. Can you give us an example that you have come across? 
[15:30]
 Well one story that moved me  Because it was so provocative and really just kind of a it  Symbolized our relation a nation real a national relationship with animals was a woman in Ohio  Who befriended a little squirrel and she brought it in and she knitted clothes for it and she made it a  symbol for Romanian orphans  and  Then the Ohio Department of Wildlife came to her house like a Waco raid to get the squirrel out because she was breaking the law 
[16:00]
 And she would not go over her dead body. They're gonna get this damn squirrel  So I just paid a visit to her and we talked to the little squirrel we watched to flop around and it's little  Outfits that she'd knitted for it and she she talked about how they're gonna have to kill her to get the squirrel  But the best part was in her making the sound that a squirrel makes when it wants to go to sleep when it wants to  Eat have you ever seen a squirrel in your kitchen run up to a bowl like a cat bowl? 
[16:30]
 I'm not of course. Yes, this is what's happening. Yes. I said, where is the squirrel?  Shouldn't be hibernating right now and she's eating the linen closet  Disturb it  The thing is a stinky oily little rodent. Right pigeon with a tail  The rat right and she's got this thing crawling all over her naked body  in her mouth and  Disgusting stuff. So yeah, that's gonna be on the show cool. No, it's hard to it in two or three 
[17:00]
 I  Was coming up next Christmas exactly how some animals made it so many thousands of years through evolution without human help  It just amazes me when you hear stories like that  Yeah, you know how the squirrels not freeze before they had women to knit them nice little  And if you see a squirrel in the street go up and pet it  Finger out and let it just chill on your finger and wait till its teeth touch. That's when I really bonded 
[17:30]
 Brian Unger from Comedy Central we got a song about hooch next there. Here's a brand new band on the music scene  They call themselves everything and they're singing about hooch  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York off yield Pearl Jam wish list coming to town in September  I believe we'll have some tickets to give away here at any W  It's Opie and Anthony and our pal Brian Unger hanging for a little longer here from Comedy Central the Daily Show the Daily Show 
[18:00]
 So I got my news. That's I I like the news on the Daily Show because it's not like the news on the networks  Right. I don't like the news on the networks. You see the tie-in things. They're doing now with the like the tsunami  Okay, tsunami a huge story huge tidal wave hits pop one New Guinea, right wipes out thousands of people  They surprise there wiped out all the villages there  Not a good place to go right now  Some tickets to Papa New Guinea. I was just gonna take a Carnival Cruise there. Yeah, I went to definitely 
[18:30]
 You know what local news is also very similar in every town you go  Yeah, no matter what town you're in. I think they're doing the same show every night  Because there is always in a whether it's Pensacola or Clovis, New Mexico. There's always a dog that called 911  I  Bet saved a lot of life right well the story just a moment  This little handsome critter called 911. You'll have the story right after this 
[19:00]
 Wow, never heard that one before  Angeles is all news all the time about pets. They're so obsessed. You know, I mean, it's all about cats calling on one one gerbils hamsters  I don't know. He's all the also in the New York Times yesterday  There's an ad for Bill Curtis's new program in its investigative report  I love that we love Bill Curtis's voice. Bill Curtis has such a great voice. Yes, he does says something like  When the truth is too much to handle  Bill Curtis brings it home 
[19:30]
 And in the story right underneath it says animal ER  With dogs with broken limbs hamsters who need dental work  You know cats in need of psychotherapy  You know investigative reports brings it home to you and that's exactly what it said. I'm not making this  Oh, I was finally got sick to my stomach watching TV the other night. It was Bill Curtis  He did a whole show on autopsies in LA showing the bodies and everything. Did anyone else see that? No, I've seen other shows 
[20:00]
 No, I'm doing nothing. I really saw dead bodies on TV. Just like that casually  They're taking homeless people out of the dumpsters and they're finding out how they died and stuff and coroners  Coroners are becoming media figures. Yeah, dangerous and very dangerous  You know what I'm saying? They're becoming celebrities like that. Dr. Michael  Bodden the guy on the OJ trial. He has HVL specials. Yeah, he's doing stand-up now 
[20:30]
 Every time I see a turn on HVO, he's there talking about some inviscerated corpse  Yeah, you know who to blame that on. Yeah, that's a Jack Clubman, you know, yeah Quincy  Quincy  Started the whole thing that whole romance with the coroner in all seriousness seriousness about TV  I don't understand why they're they're allowed to show all these dead bodies and stuff  But we're still not allowed to show, you know women, you know topless, you know, that is so offensive  But showing a homeless person in a dumpster dead is just okay for us to view at night 
[21:00]
 Yeah, it isn't right by the way  Newspapers often awarded as he's an award-winning journalist  To show a dead body any time give that person an Emmy  In the papers it's directly proportional to how far away the dead body is how much of it they could show  Papa New Guinea the tsunami they show the complete dead body and they could show it  Those were awful pictures to coming back one  And I like how they're now using that story to spin off sort of home care products and things like that on the line 
[21:30]
 You know  Her products for tsunami  Have you tried them you'll have a full investigative report coming up tonight  Einstein Phillips tonight on Dateline  How to dispose of bloated corpses  Is it happening to you? I mean really there's a there's that that cookie angle that they take a story and then they bring it home  They do that well they bring it home bring it home local in New York with the tsunami thing tsunami 
[22:00]
 Could it happen here in New York and they get the scientist that explains the fissure in the Atlantic Ocean and for ten minutes  He's explaining this and then he goes um no right now won't have possibly happen. You try to scare you though  Yeah, they tease you and then they say absolutely not absolutely not coming up at 11  Yeah, find out if a tsunami is gonna hit man. They have to make it sound so often  Do you think in Papua New Guinea said there's a news guy going?  Giant crane accident could happen here 
[22:30]
 All right, we got to get you out of here I guess Brian, okay, hey we're  Can I do this now should I say you want to do the plug the plug?  Here's the piece of business people  Brian's gonna be having a show tonight a little TV show on cable  It's not on Sunday  Actually, it's tonight on Wednesday night and this program is our second anniversary 
[23:00]
 Daily show special we'll take a look back at some of the stories that touched us that made us laugh made us cry  It's the daily show  Second anniversary special celebrating two years of a reference and kookyness  from the folks at Comedy Central  Very nice  We haven't hit the phones yet today if you got something give us a call  It's over. It's Anthony and it's Led Zeppelin on one of two seven WNEW aware rock lift 
[23:30]
 Apollo 14 was that was like 1961 was it no  Look at you. Go back to school college boy. What year was that? Well, let me look  Oh, it's a computer in front of you. I don't have the computer in front of me for this  I'd know he was Apollo 14  But it was and that must have taken some nads  All right  That was right after Apollo 13 which didn't make it right to the moon  Did Alan Shepard do some other stuff before I actually went to the moon though? 
[24:00]
 He was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts which started nearly 60. Yes, that's what I was getting at  Yes, I didn't want to sound too stupid on that  He was he was really the the rabble rouser of them all, you know, right?  That's why he took a golf club and a golf ball up on the moon with him and well  He wanted to be you know the first to do something on the moon  Yeah, that started getting ridiculous, you know  The first guy to step on the moon the first guy to hit a golf ball on the moon  You know the first one to play basketball on the moon 
[24:30]
 And I imagine what that must have been like them going to the moon  I mean looking down on earth big blue thing just hanging there  And you would think being an astronaut, right? It's a pretty noble job, right?  Yes, you think it was any different for an astronaut  Than it is for a guy that works at a deli counter or at a trash truck as far as his wife is concerned  Doesn't matter what you do now there's gonna be problems you think like after being chosen to go to the moon 
[25:00]
 You'd go home and go honey. Yeah, guess what? Yeah, I'm going to the moon. I got picked for the moon  Yeah, I'm going sure for mankind, you know one of the guys going to the moon  This is my dream come true as an astronaut. I've always wanted to go to the moon  I'm going to the moon you would think the wife would understand, right?  Hmm. Oh, no fine  When will you be going  Honey, it's the moon.

[27:30]
 It says heatwave health advisory for Long Island athletes to be issued  Sure, it'd be a heat  Health advisory for all athletes today. Why is Long Island athletes? I don't know  I think the guys playing softball in Jersey need this heat advisory as well. Maybe for the Goodwill games  Well, they're saying that but they're also saying for all the kids playing little league and stuff  Do we really need these advisories and stuff? Can we take care of ourselves?  I think you know when it's a little hot you shouldn't be exerting yourself. Yeah. Yeah coming in today on the LIE 
[28:00]
 Ozone alert now. What is an ozone alert? I thought that that's not running out of yeah, that sounds scary  No, and you get this much heat it  reacts with the  Smog and stuff. Okay discharge of cars and everything makes ozone gas. So is that deadly?  Did you get a bad sunburn? Don't worry. What do you do? It's a respiratory thing  You could you have asthma attacks or okay kill over and die. All right, check your elderly 
[28:30]
 I know check your elderly news  Channel two four seven all you guys  The elderly they've been living a long long time  I think they know what to do in the heat more than you and I yeah  They can get through the heat check the elderly don't leave your dog your pets outside without water  Well, so they say wear like clothes. We know to wear like clothing, you know today  I thought I was gonna put on the Johnny Cash  Outfit and walk around Manhattan, right?  Of course that we know to wear like clothes when it's uh, just hot out 
[29:00]
 I like it when it's this hot when it gets this hot up in the upper 90s  It's still not hot enough for the weatherman  Yeah, they have to get on and give you something called the heat index to make it seem even hotter. Yeah  It's like well, you know the heat combined with the humidity. Oh, it feels like 115 degrees  Our heat humidity index we also have our other index, you know with this heat at 97 degrees if someone threw  Hydrochloric acid in your face. It could feel like 850 degrees 
[29:30]
 And do you know what the heat at 97 degrees if we suddenly broke loose of our rotation around the Sun and hurled towards the Sun  It could get into the tens of thousands of degrees. So please wear that like clothing exactly  They think I'm gonna make it sound worse. They state the obvious they get so excited when it gets this hot  Nothing else to report on the weather in the summertime unless it gets this hot weather guys love it  Yeah, but drink plenty of fluids. Oh, really? I wouldn't know that one  Just wondering why I was lying on the sidewalk with my tongue hanging out 
[30:00]
 Fluid. Yeah  And I'm sure we'll have the report tonight and one of the news stations will do it  They'll do a piece near a fire hydrant that is loose. Ah, yes  You know with the kids playing in the background in the fire hydrant  Please don't blame one of these if there's a fire we won't have pressure  Right and then they'll they'll interview the reporters someone on I don't know the FDR or something in traffic  Is it hot enough for you?

[31:00]
 Are they gonna get anything new from little Johnny that this year that they don't have on file from 1955?  Wave, you know same stuff every year every year.

[39:00]
 We all know about the Seattle thing Long Island had their scene for a little while  Yeah, when's that coming back around any coming back around for a while no offense to the musicians on the island  But I think our time has passed out there  Yeah, yeah, you think they'd have to move somewhere else where they're the scene well  Yeah, and LA I think has a perpetual scene going on as does New York City  You know there's always good bands coming out of but a hot spot right now. It's the Florida area really yes

We had Brian Unger in from Comedy Central  He's on the Daily Show. He's a good pal of ours. We really like him a lot and 
[41:30]
 One of the things he did for us while the music was playing was his Charles Carolle  Impression I never knew anybody who did a Charles Carolle depression  And you know when you're watching Sunday morning at the end of the show they think give you the sounds of like nature or the  Sound it up, and yeah, yeah the sounds of some wild duck from Vermont  And you just sit there and you listen to birds and stuff  It's the most bogus piece boring as hell boring as hell anyway  Brian Unger came up with this little diddy at Charles Carolle moments something we might want to hear yes check this out as we leave 
[42:00]
 You on this Sunday morning  Here's me taking a big poop  Sometimes a poop is a good thing on a Sunday morning something you'd like to share with your neighbors your friends  Oh, here's me and the sounds of dumping  Oftentimes we don't have time to show you the poop 
[42:30]
