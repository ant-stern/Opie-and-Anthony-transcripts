 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Kenny Wayne Shepard off his Trouble Is CD.  That's somehow, somewhere, someway, Soul Asylum in there, and Semisonic doing Closing Time.  And we're setting up the Imaginary Ballroom.  And in about an hour, hour and a half, we'll have Semisonic in the Imaginary Ballroom performing  Closing Time Live, I'm sure, and some other songs.  Little band from Minnesota.  We'll get to hang with them a little bit today.  The land of musicians and murderers, it seems, lately, huh? 
[00:30]
 Murderers?  Yeah.  Bunch of murderers coming out of there.  Which ones?  Serial killers.  Serial killers?  Yeah.  Who was from Minnesota?  I was watching, like, A&E.  Oh.  And then there was a bunch of them out of...  With Bill Curtis?  Bill Curtis.  I love those shows, but then it's hard to sleep after that.  You have nightmares.  It's all real life.  It's too real.  I sleep like a baby after I do something like that.  Sure.  Yeah.  How are you?  I guess today's the day, Monica Lewinsky.  Yeah? 
[01:00]
 Giving her a little testimony.  You know Kenneth Starr is going to leak the info to the press immediately.  Someone will.  So we're going to find out some juicy stuff later on this afternoon, I'm sure.  Everything about the Stane and what happened during her visits to the White House.  Well, Bill's taking it pretty casually.  Well, I got an observation, though.  What?  You know, the heat has turned on on Bill Clinton again.  Yeah.  And guess what is happening in the Middle East?  Oh, yeah.  Saddam Hussein is popping up again.  We got some problems with those guys once again.  It always seems to coincide with the problems Bill has back home here. 
[01:30]
 What a coincidence, yeah.  I am going to go on record and say that Bill Clinton and Saddam Hussein are drinking buddies.  You think they're in cahoots?  They're in cahoots, without a doubt.  I'm having a little trouble over here again.  Things are getting a little hot.  There's Saddam could look like we'll say you did this.  I promise I won't bomb you and just get no start making some noise.  Yeah.  Anti-American rhetoric, please. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, he's helping them out.  I'm hurting here.  That stain is mine.  Right.  You know, he'll send them over some Baywatch tapes and Saddam Hussein will help them out of another jam.  So yeah, I'm convinced though, because it always pops up at the same time, directly,  directly proportional to the president's problems.  True.  Truth is what is going on in the Middle East.  I don't think he'll skirt this one though.  We'll see what happens.  Monica's talking right now.  Skirt the issue.  She's talking right now.  So we'll see what happens. 
[02:30]
 All right.  We're ready to rock here.  2127571027.  Whoa, phone lines are ringing like crazy already.  Cool.  If you're at work, you want to fax us, 212957WNEW.  And if you want to send feedback to the WNEW studios,  it must be really important though.  Please click on our pictures on the WNEW website and you could, you know,  whip off an email right to the studio.  Okay.  Yeah.  Coming back with some Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin.  Next, 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Aerosmith, the latest from them from the Armageddon soundtrack. 
[03:00]
 What kind of love are you on?  There's a little blurb in the paper about Steven Tyler and Perry and the gang.  They were swimming with sharks in an aquarium.  Yeah, I heard about that.  They put on some scuba gear and went into the shark tank.  Now looking like Steven Tyler, isn't that dangerous?  The sharks could like, you know, mistake him for like large mouth bass or something.  Why would you want to swim with sharks in an aquarium tank?  Pretty crazy.  That's right.  What are the shark going to do, bite them?  I guess. 
[03:30]
 Go on like an acid trip that a fish has never had before.  What did I eat, man?  Whoa, I'm tripping.  It's pretty bizarre.  Yeah.  I guess when you're a big rock star, you can do whatever you want.  I want to swim with the sharks.  Then you get to do that.  We'll set that right up for you.  Let's see if we can swim with some fish at the aquarium.  Swim with any sharks?  No.  Abby here.  What do I want to do that for?  Speaking of bizarre, story of the day.  You hear about this guy in Scotland?  What?  This is going to gross you out.  I know it.  John Kamikaze, Scotland's self-styled Prince of Pain. 
[04:00]
 This was in all the papers today.  He set a stomach-churning world record when he spent 15 minutes suspended in midair by  meat hooks embedded in his back.  A smiling Kamikaze with eight meat hooks stuck in his back and one in each leg said  pain was all in the mind.  And then he lacks a mind, so I guess he didn't feel pain.  It didn't hurt a bit.  It's just a case of mind over matter, said Kamikaze, and perfectly happy.  The only thing that hurts is a blister on my foot from walking about too much yesterday. 
[04:30]
 Oh, yeah.  And then the next story ends.  Not surprisingly, the stunt has never before been attempted.  Remember, itty bitty, the guy who was in the water?  Remember idiots like that in school?  They used to just do things just so they could, like they'd be out in the middle of the winter  without their coat on.  I'm not cold.  Yeah.  And you knew they were cold.  Like, yeah, I'll do that.  I can wrap myself over the head with a hammer.  It doesn't hurt.  You're an idiot.  Yeah.  Trying to prove something. 
[05:00]
 So, lovely.  Thank you.  I think it hurt him.  Of course it did.  He's lying.  Meat hooks in your back?  My God.  All right.  We're getting a ton of requests for the Big Willie Pop commercial.  Monica Lewinsky currently testifying, I believe, as we speak here.  We're going to try to get some audio of Monica Lewinsky testifying.  Yeah.  I think we could dig that up.  We do have some connections, and we're going to try to get some of that audio on the air  for you in a little bit.  But here's the Big Willie Pop commercial.  So, 27WNEW, where Rock lives with Eddie Money. 
[05:30]
 You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  And at Shea, the Mets have just tied up the Giants in the bottom of the ninth.  It's 8-8, no outs, two men on, looking good for the Mets at Shea.  On this beautiful day for baseball.  A high fly ball deep to center field.  Actually, we got the sound down because, honestly, the baseball announcers are useless.  Completely useless.  Yeah, they seem to not pay much attention to the game, quite frankly, 
[06:00]
 when they're yapping to each other.  They could just be talking, and it's just a consequential thing that they might throw in a play.  Actually, the game is getting in the way of their conversation, is what it is.  Yeah, but they can do two things at one time, which is pretty cool.  They tell the stories and call the game at the same time.  Oh, yes, I was out with the wife last night.  You know, we went to this lovely restaurant down there on the west side, the pitch wide, for ball three. 
[06:30]
 Great thing, big plate of pasta.  It was fantastic, had a great time.  You know what I saw down there? That one high and wide for ball three.  He said ball three already.  Oh, sorry. He walks him.  There you go.  He doesn't even pay attention to the game.  I know, he didn't pay attention to the game.  He called the wrong play there.  That one going deep?  Yep.  So what'd you do last night? And picked off to end the inning.  All right, well now the bases are loaded, no outs. 
[07:00]
 I think it's a gimme, it's a win at this point.  All right.  You know what I'm looking at here on the paper?  Mark McGuire, if he breaks Roger Maris' record, he will not buy the ball.  Well, first of all, with this home run record thing, everyone is talking about Mark McGuire, Mark McGuire, Mark McGuire.  Sammy Sosa, Sammy Sosa, Sammy Sosa.  Right, I know, but you know, McGuire's ahead.  Barely though, it's getting a lot tighter and closer.  And I still think Ken Griffey Jr. actually is going to set the record. 
[07:30]
 Well, they asked McGuire if he would buy the ball.  He says, no, I don't care. What do I want it for? I'm not going to buy it. I'm not going to spend a dime for it.  Why does he have to buy the ball that he, you know, set the record with?  Shouldn't they just give it to him? He set the record. Here you go, pal. Congratulations.  Baseball memorabilia these days is worth a fortune.  And that ball, experts are saying, when the record is broken, it is going to be worth, get this, in excess of a million dollars. 
[08:00]
 No.  Someone's going to get killed trying to get that ball when they take that out.  Exactly. Exactly. Let's go back to when Hank Aaron set the record.  Remember all the people in the stands with the big fishnets and stuff?  The pool, like the skimmer you use for a pool.  Yeah.  That's what people were using.  But it's going to be worth in excess of a million dollars thrown out into a probably drunk crowd.  I mean, think about it. Think of a poor seven-year-old kid catches that ball.  Yeah.  Or it kind of hits and starts rolling under the seats. 
[08:30]
 There's a million dollars, there's a lottery ticket rolling down under the seat.  I was going to say, you think Powerball was a problem in Connecticut?  Yeah.  This is a major problem.  There's no saying when it's going to happen, where it's going to happen, where in the stands it's going to go, so they can't have police everywhere.  I bet you someone gets hurt real bad.  No, that wouldn't be cool.  I got the hand of the seven-year-old boy and the ball. Amazing. I hacked it off with a machete. 
[09:00]
 And some fat drunken slob. He will run over the seven-year-old to get that ball.  I like the morons that don't even know anything and they're all drunk.  There might be this record-breaking ball that goes in the stands and they throw it back.  They scare you. You just threw away about ten grand, you idiot.  You think Al Sharpton will be in the stands trying to catch that ball?  I got to pay off the Tijuana Brawler Trial. Come on! 
[09:30]
 The big catch is mid-on. Come on, baby! Poppa needs a new pair of shoes.  Bring it on!  Instead of a catch, he could use that medallion to try to catch the ball.  Mark McGuire, come light my fire! Bring it on!  Very nice. Alright. The Imaginary Ballroom is being set up for Semisonic.  They should be here sometime in the four o'clock hour. They'll be doing closing time live.  They're playing tonight with Soul Asylum and Matchbox 20. 
[10:00]
 We'll get to talk to them and hang with them a little bit.  On the way, we got the Rolling Stones, 7 Mary 3 next.  And if you got something for the show, just give us a call.  212-757-1027. It's over. That's one.  5 of the 9th with Lou Rowley.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York. Here's 7 Mary 3.  Over your shoulder.  1027-WNEW, where a rock lives to who? From Who's Next, it's Ophi and Anthony.  The Imaginary Ballroom is set and ready to go. We just need a band. 
[10:30]
 They're coming in and just a bit here. They're playing with Soul Asylum and Matchbox 20 tonight at the PNC Bank Arts Center.  Jones Beach tomorrow night, of course.  And hopefully they'll be here soon.  Dow is up 30 points at the close today.  So we're making a slight comeback, right?  We're coming back.  Slowly but surely. We came back 59 points yesterday, another 32 today.  Our stocks, Ophi, went up today, too. We're up 716s.  Oh! 
[11:00]
 Yeah, so that's some.  Let me do the math, 766.  Split it up and...  Oh!  It's $2.28 each.  Yeah, each.  Alright!  Get that computer.  I'm going to invest in a company that makes those big wraparound old people's glasses.  Those big... because every old person I see out there, when it's sunny out,  they've got the big Terminator glasses on, with the vents in the side.  I just don't think it would be a good stock, because then when the sun goes away,  you can't really depend on those glasses.  Well, then I'll go with the company, because there's a lot more people living a lot longer these days. 
[11:30]
 So you've got to start investing in things that old people use.  So I'm going to get the polyester pants that go up to the men's nipples,  and the little thin belts that hold them there.  That's what I want, the shorts and the long pants.  Do you think a store actually sells those pants?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah. They've got to pull them up, because I guess when you get old...  Getting old sucks. God!  I guess when you get old, your hips disappear or something.  So you've got to pull your pants up above now your belly. 
[12:00]
 Is that what it is?  And then just wrench that belt down.  So you can see the white socks and the patent leather shoes with the fringe on top.  What is that look?  That's their golf shoes.  Yeah, they're wearing the golf shoes walking through the streets of Manhattan.  The golf shirt.  By the way, it's a spray paint hair alert today.  Yes, it is above 80 degrees, so it is a spray paint hair alert.  Yes, so you might not want to put the spray paint hair on today. 
[12:30]
 If you're doing the comb over and then you're using that spray paint,  that Ronco spray head stuff, it will melt at temperatures above 80 degrees or so.  And it will drip into your eyes.  So, yeah, just wind up looking like the guy from the crow, the movie The Crow.  Black running down your face.  That's very good.  Watch it.  What do you got?  Hi, what's up?  Hi, is this OP and Anthony?  Yes.  I think you guys are great.  Hey, thank you. 
[13:00]
 Fantastic.  Anyway, new listener to the show.  I think you're great.  Hey, thanks.  Terrific.  Did I win anything?  Oh, you buttered us up because you thought we'd give you something.  Oh, wow.  We thought you actually liked our show.  Oh, that's terrible.  I cannot believe I got through.  My husband is going to be so excited.  Oh, here we thought we finally made a friend.  You did.  I feel just like that episode of the Brady Bunch where Greg thought the girl liked him,  but it was only because he was the judge in the cheerleading contest. 
[13:30]
 Damn.  No, no, your bits are great.  It's nice, it's new, it's refreshing.  All right.  And it's funny.  Well, I'm like 7-up.  But I don't have any Elton John tickets.  You don't have any Elton John tickets?  No.  You don't?  No, no, of course I don't.  That's what we should do, is get a pile of Elton John tickets.  We can win over this audience.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Butter us up and tell us how much you like us and we'll give you Elton John tickets.  Well, I love Elton John.  You think we raid around here or you think Opie and Anthony actually have the Elton John tickets? 
[14:00]
 Please.  Scott Muni is sitting on the whole pile right now in his office.  Sure he is.  We don't have tickets to the guy that plays the saxophone in the subway.  All right.  Have a good afternoon.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Bye.  And now your New York Knicks.  That's like the sports song, you know?  It sure is.  1027 WNEW where a rock lives, yellow, fire on high and the Bodine's closer to free from  Party of Five.  So, uh...  Oh.  Party of Five, man. 
[14:30]
 Well, that's why I paused because I knew you'd lose it.  Just to mention a Party of Five and Anthony loses it.  Let me just get the picture of Jennifer Love, you hit my head.  Okay, you got it.  All right.  Ah, damn, Carson keeps getting stuck in my head now.  She's going out with him.  Yes, yes.  Whoa, I hear open up the door.  What do we got?  Sound check on it?  Yeah, Semisonic is sound checking in the imaginary ballroom.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks.  Now it's just ended.  All right, close the door.  All right. 
[15:00]
 I like drum checks.  All right, give it a kick.  Boy, that's entertaining.  All right, give it a snap.  Boom.  Go around the kid.  Cymbal.  Oh, shut up, right?  That's when you know you're in the club too early.  Yeah.  They're doing that.  Maybe I should have stayed home for another couple hours.  All right, all right, I got to get the bass.  I like the guy that just says mic check over and over again.  In the back.  Mic check.  Two, check.  One, check.  Check.  Check.  More.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check. 
[15:30]
 Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  Check.  More.  Monitor.  Check.  Check.  In the back.  Check.  Check.  Give me another beer.  You guys are great.  Yeah.  Whoo!  Through the check song again.  All right, we're going to have Semisonic in here in a little bit when they get their  sound check over with.  Giants Tackle the Bangle, Saturday at 7 o' 5.  The Giants rock right here on 1027W&EW all season long. 
[16:00]
 And we got a pretty cool fax here.  Opie and Anthony.  I work in New Jersey but I live in New York.  I hate these New Jersey giant fans.  When I think of the giants I picture LT smoking crack in the locker room, Fat Bill Parcells  running off the field in the 80s and some punk pelting one of the coaches with a snowball.  At least us jet fans are known for more tangible offenses such as fires in the stands and beer  bans because of rowdiness.  Come to think of it, I'm moving to Dallas.  Signed Joe Nader. 
[16:30]
 Joe Nader.  Alright.  Alright man.  Alright next time we talk we'll have Semisonic in the studio so stick around for that.  Also on the way we'll do some Days of the New and U2 next by request.  1027 WNEW The Rock of New York with U2.  It's Opie and Anthony and they're finally here.  We got Jake, John and Dan at Semisonic.  Hey.  Hello guys.  Can we talk yet?  Yeah you can talk.  Everything okay now?  Everything's okay.  I need to check those bongos a little further.  We'll talk to you later on. 
[17:00]
 We can have a little more time to do that.  So what's up guys?  How long have you been in New York?  This morning.  This morning?  Have you seen anything really cool out there on the streets?  A lot of tall buildings out there.  Yeah boy oh boy you got some tall buildings.  We're from Minneapolis you know.  My neck is just like craning.  Grooved up.  Are you like all the other tourists and you're constantly staring up?  Craning.  That's how we know you guys are from out of town.  I hope that guy gives me back the 20 bucks I loaned him.  You know you can tell we're visitors because we keep telling everyone that this place is  so beautiful. 
[17:30]
 When you say that to someone who lives here they give you kind of a sour grunt.  Beautiful?  Whatever.  The visitors are all saying I think it's a wonderful mosaic of people and cultures.  Mosaic alright.  Every day there's something different on the streets out there.  Different bodily fluid.  There's actually one that seems to be the main one.  What were you saying?  The bodily fluid that I always recognize on the street.  Oh the smell.  The smells in New York are pretty special too.  You really need to drive pretty far out of town in Minneapolis to smell that particular 
[18:00]
 smell.  Really got to get into the farmland.  Well it's still winter up there.  When does it snow?  Hey wait a minute.  That's not fair.  We're here in front of you.  It's the first week of August.  Which is summertime.  The first week of August is the official start of the summer.  Why are we here then Jake?  Why aren't we lounging on our barco loungers?  You guys get to play golf a week a year up there. 
[18:30]
 What is it?  Labor Day is coming up in like three days for us?  Is that the deal?  Memorial Day was last weekend and Labor Day is tomorrow.  Minnesota.  What did you guys do up there before you started playing music?  Oh we were going stir crazy.  I mean what's there to do in Minneapolis?  That's a good question.  I think the reason there are so many bands there is because really there's nothing.  You've got to just get your guitar and go down into the basement and survive on rations.  People go out and rock in the most unlikely conditions. 
[19:00]
 You'll see people standing in snowmobile suits in parking lots clapping their hands together  preparing to rock.  Although when you have those gloves on the goat horns of rock approval don't look as  cool because you can't see the fingers.  You can't see it with the mittens.  The people stand there with their mittens held up but you don't know if they're giving  you the horns of coolness or not.  The stage guys, the stage hands in Minneapolis all have snow shovels in case of any problems  on stage during the show.  They can dig out your amp and get to it. 
[19:30]
 We've got to start selling our town a little more positively.  Minneapolis rocks.  Well a lot of music coming out of Minneapolis these days.  We talked to Johnny Lang last week.  He was really cool.  We found out he's a Prince fan and you guys are into Prince a little bit too.  Have you guys hung out with Prince?  Have you seen him around town?  For us there's not been a lot of hanging out with Prince.  We've been passing him in hallways and then sort of a muted, hey what's up, you know,  kind of a situation.  Is he as bizarre as they say?  I couldn't imagine just hanging with him anyway.  Well Prince?  How would you? 
[20:00]
 Everyone from Minneapolis is like Prince so we don't know if, you know, maybe from the  outside perspective he would seem kind of strange but you know.  I just couldn't picture him going, yeah come on in we'll watch the three stooges.  Yeah right.  I've got this video I've been wanting to see.  I see in New York having a symbol for your name is considered strange.  But in Minneapolis we're a little more open minded.  The guy is like, he's our godhead.  He's like the, you know, he's the best thing that came through town for years and years  and he makes amazing albums and we're, you know, kind of starstruck by him. 
[20:30]
 Yeah he can't grow up there without being influenced by him.  We do a couple songs of his actually.  Yeah that's what I heard.  I don't know if he would like our version of Erotic City or not but we think it rocks.  Maybe that's all you know.  All right.  Good deal.  So why are you guys called Semisonic?  I mean is there more to the band?  That's the name of the group.  Oh, how do we come up with it?  Yeah.  I mean why aren't you guys sonic?  Or fully sonic or somewhat sonic?  Yeah you're just semisonic. 
[21:00]
 I just thought it was, I don't know, I thought it was a really cool sounding name and then  a long sales pitch to John and Jake they falsely concluded it was a cool sounding name too and  that was the name of the band.  All right I gotta ask you something.  All right so there were other names that you were thinking of for the band, right?  What was there?  There was like World Destruction 2000.  Yeah Rocksplosion.  Rocksplosion.  97.  But then we figured we'd have to be changing our name all the time.  Every year.  Like Match Game.  The old game.  Match Game.  72. 
[21:30]
 76.  Yeah so we, so Semisonic was the best name.  It was the simplest of a lot of really complicated you know.  I know when you're younger band names you pick them, you pick the name that could look  the coolest when your girlfriend draws it on the notebook.  You feel pointy metallic letters.  We actually sent ours out to a hundred teenage girls and had them draw it on the notebook.  Once it came back we knew it was a great name.  There's two I's for you to put little balloons over.  Our hearts or whatever.  Whatever you feel is appropriate.  Bubbly, puffy.  Yeah.  Teddy bears go cool over the I's too. 
[22:00]
 Yeah.  So what's the inspiration for closing time?  You guys hang out in bars a lot obviously.  Yeah.  We've spent a lot of time being gently convinced by the last employee that it's time to go.  You know guys we really love having you around and we like your music but the lights are  out and there's no one but me and the janitor.  You've got to go.  The inspiration for the song really was that John and I said to Dan, Dan we're going out  for a party.  Why don't you come up with a good song.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[22:30]
 Stay home, try to have some fun on your long term.  We'll be thinking about you.  Alright you guys want to head into the imaginary ballroom and play some?  Yeah sure.  Is that what that place is?  What are all those imaginary people doing in there?  Exactly.  Alright we're going to play some, pay some bills.  Sorry we'll be back with Semisonic from the imaginary ballroom next.  Stay there.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  That's Truly Truly from Grantley Buffalo.  Another artist that played in the imaginary ballroom a while back and we just had Semisonic 
[23:00]
 doing Closing Time in the imaginary ballroom.  Got to thank those guys for stopping on by.  They sounded great.  They sounded really really good.  If you missed their live performance of Closing Time we'll be playing that from time to time  here at NEW.  And they're playing tomorrow night at the PNC Banks Art Center with Matchbox 20 and Soul  Asylum tickets still available.  If you can't go tomorrow night they're playing Saturday.  Wow it's Thursday already?  This week flew by.  They're playing Saturday at Jones Beach. 
[23:30]
 Alright.  Soapy and Anthony.  Anthony how long have we been here at NEW?  I know it's like our 30th show.  31st show whatever.  Somewhere around there.  Alright we've been here about two months, two and a half months okay.  Sale staff at NEW they work about 20 minutes a day as we all know by now.  Yeah so the odds of them actually hitting and getting a sale for our show is pretty slim.  Well Anthony, big day on the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  We have our first brand new advertiser to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[24:00]
 Wow.  Yes and if you want to be a future advertiser on the Opie and Anthony show give the sales  staff a call.  They work about 15 to 20 minutes a day starting at 9 in the morning.  Let me guess, let me guess.  Okay alright.  Budweiser.  No.  Coca Cola.  No.  Let me think. 
[24:30]
 Gotta lower your standards just a little bit.  Just a little.  RC Cola.  No.  Okay I'm thinking, I'm thinking.  Like Goodyear tires.  No car dealership.  Car?  Oh let's see.  GMC.  No.  It's a little small car dealership.  Alright.  Called Clean Motors.  Gotta welcome them to the Opie and Anthony family, our latest sponsor on the show and  here's their commercial.  Alright. 
[25:00]
 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, a band from Florida.  That's Creed and My Own Prison.  Those guys have played live for us in the past.  Maybe we could get them in the imaginary ballroom of the future.  You never know.  Actually we got Harvey Danger scheduled for next Tuesday I believe.  Like Pulsida.  So maybe we should get them.  Like Pulsida.  So make sure you check that out.  Too bad if you're just tuning in you missed Semisonic doing closing time for the imaginary  ballroom.  Sounded great and we'll be playing that live version from time to time here on NEW. 
[25:30]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey what's up?  Thanks for checking us out once again today.  We appreciate it.  As we always do.  Yes.  We need the listeners.  It looks like Reverend Al is saying that Pagonis is not for real he says.  What?  Well Stephen Pagonis of course won a little settlement against Sharpton Mason & Maddox  for the Tawana Brawley debacle.  Yeah they gotta pay him some like $300,000.  Yeah $345,000, $65,000 of which should come from Al Sharpton. 
[26:00]
 Yes.  So Stephen Pagonis just said hey I want to start some healing here and maybe me and Al  Sharpton should get together in the name of you know peace and understanding.  Yeah maybe in a cage match.  Yeah.  Well Al Sharpton replies he knows those comments would get him in the media.  He's just looking for media coverage.  If he was sincere I would have no problem meeting with him.  Remember I met the man who stabbed me.  Remember when Al got stabbed?  Yes I do.  So he's saying. 
[26:30]
 Is he going to appeal this decision then?  That's what it says right here.  He'll be appealing the jury decision for the money and he said his phone has been ringing  off the hook with offers to pay his debt.  Can you believe that?  Come on ring it off the hook.  Wait a minute.  Uh oh.  Why?  Here he comes Darryl.  I told you I've been vindicated.  Al Sharpton.  I told you.  What the hell is going on?  I've been vindicated.  So Al your phone's ringing off the hook.  People want to pay your fine for you?  Ringing off the hook I set up my Al Sharpton pay my fine hotline. 
[27:00]
 My motto got a dollar give me a holler.  The charges stuck send Al a buck.  What the heck send your government checks.  Come on Al.  I need the cash so call to pay my fine hotline at 1-999-KISS-MY-ASS.  Alright.  And leave the last S off that's the S for send me more money. 
[27:30]
 I'm too fast to go to jail.  Hey your hair's looking awfully nice today.  I can't afford hair care products.  It's the humidity.  It's making me look like Link from the Mouth Squad.  I gotta press this sucker down.  Alright get out of the studio.  Bye Al.  Get out of here.  I've been vindicated.  Yeah yeah yeah.  1027WIDW where Rock lives Dave Edmonds.  I hear you knocking.  Good cruising song huh?  Yeah.  It's opiate Anthony. 
[28:00]
 Oh by the way to the person that was flying a kite on the Grand Central Parkway two days ago I got your kite.  We haven't even talked about it on the air yet.  It's by the Van Wyk.  The Van Wyk.  LIE.  Right okay we're driving home and also this kite is just flying over traffic.  Yeah for some reason people fly kites right near the landing pattern for JFK.  Yeah that makes me feel safe next time I'm flying into town.  So it's where it was down the expressway which is rare in itself and a kite comes flying across the road. 
[28:30]
 And I missed it but the string got twisted on my antenna.  And I was flying a kite at about 80 miles an hour.  So now you're flying a kite off your antenna.  And then traffic was delayed because then the kite is bouncing all over the road.  Everyone had to slow down.  That's where people fly their kites.  So people were late because someone was flying a kite.  People still do that.  Yeah I guess so.  Hey what do you got on the instant feedback?  Well Jay from Jersey has an interesting observation. 
[29:00]
 Alright.  These makeshift roadside memorials says I see it all over the place.  I can't drive two miles without passing a wooden cross draped in flowers on the side of the road.  Crosses everywhere.  It is tragic that so many people died on the road but it amazes me that so many others feel the need to go home to their workshops and make crosses to mark the spot of the accident.  My question is this.  Why are Jews better drivers than Christians?  I just drove 20 miles and I don't recall seeing one star of David adorning the highway median. 
[29:30]
 I saw three crosses though.  Either Jews are better drivers or they just aren't as good at woodworking.  Oh man.  Jay from Jersey.  That's a pretty good observation actually.  When I pass those it just gives me the creeps.  Yeah why would anyone do that?  I mean I understand the feeling of loss and everything.  But why mark the spot?  Why would you want to be reminded where it all happened?  Eggs marks the spot.  It's like the big tree with a big chunk of bark taken out of it. 
[30:00]
 It's even worse when you pass by and you see like little stuffed animals.  I know.  Oh that hurt.  It's just not good whatsoever.  Wear your damn seat belt.  Alright why is everyone coming in and out of the studio?  We're broadcasting here.  Okay thank you.  No one notices that we're trying to do a radio show.  Alright that's cool.  Jimmy Hendrix on the way and the wall flowers.  1027 WNEW where?  Rock lives it's Zopie and Anthony. 
[30:30]
 We've got to congratulate the NEW softball team.  They got their first win of the season yesterday.  Wow.  Earl is that true?  You guys actually won a game yesterday?  Yes we did.  Now you guys were playing the clowns right?  Yes we were.  They were playing.  So you made them play with their stilts on.  Is that the only way we got a win out of this?  No there was only one clown.  One clown.  The shortstop was on a unicycle.  Did they take the field?  Did they come out in a little car and all pile out and you were amazed how many clowns fit in the car?  No stop. 
[31:00]
 Woo we're going to play the NEW softball team.  Take the field boys.  Don't you know.  Did you make them juggle balls and play softball at the same time?  I'm going to pitch one of these 12 balls I'm juggling.  Don't you know.  How can I run to first with these big goofy shoes on?  Don't you know.  We're getting beaten by the NEW softball team.  We are clowns. 
[31:30]
 Alright so you beat some clowns yesterday.  Who are you guys playing next week?  The Girl Scout troop or that game didn't come in for you?  Actually we're playing Boar's Head next week.  Boar's Head.  Boar's Head.  Okay very good.  Well congratulations.  What are you guys 1 in 15?  1 in 5.  Alright very good.  Wow regular Yankees.  1027 WNEW where rock lives. 
[32:00]
 Kansas Squeezing Air and the new band Everything with Hooch.  When I hear that song when I'm cruising around you've got to just turn it up and get your seat back and you just kind of go with the tune.  You groove.  You do groove at that.  I kind of like the same feeling you get when Low Rider comes on the radio.  You just kind of mellow out for a little bit.  Sure.  Alright so Pete Anthony how are you bro?  Very good.  I was looking through the paper.  Do you realize there's a booby bar right near where we live? 
[32:30]
 Yeah.  In Huntington.  You want to go there tonight?  I didn't mean that I just didn't know if you knew.  I know you want to go tonight.  Let's check it out.  I can't go.  Dude I don't know what happened.  Wait a minute.  What do you mean you can't go?  I don't know I think I got plans.  Alright this is what you do.  I'm going to drop you off a little bit.  Get in a fight.  Works every time though.  Get in a fight and then we can go to the booby bar.  I'd say we'd go this weekend but I don't know either. 
[33:00]
 Might have planned.  Something happened.  Let me get this straight.  I don't know if it's just me.  When guys get married all of a sudden your weekends.  You have plans every weekend.  Your weekends disappear basically.  I don't know what happened and it never comes up.  I go let's go out this weekend.  Oh you can't go out?  We have plans.  When did we make these plans? 
[33:30]
 Maybe I was sitting watching the Yankee game and some tentative plans were whispered in my ear.  Sunday rolls around.  Alright you're scheduled to have your penis removed.  We talked about it Wednesday.  You signed the papers.  I did?  I signed papers and my penis removed?  You signed it.  Look right here.  I told you you'd never listen to me.  See?  But now I can't even say alright maybe this weekend we'll go to the booby bar.  You got plans?  I probably have plans. 
[34:00]
 I'm booked until 2003.  Every weekend.  I'm glad.  You spend most of your 20s going to weddings.  I'm just about out of wedding hell finally.  With your buddies.  In your 20s you have two lives.  Your work life and your wedding life.  Every weekend you have to travel somewhere for someone's wedding.  That's true.  I had like eight weddings in a row one summer.  Weekend after weekend after weekend.  Must have cost you what?  Like 30, 40 bucks.  You know it's funny when you get married in your early 20s. 
[34:30]
 When one of your friends get married in their early 20s and they invite your friends.  They don't make out like you do if you wait until they actually get jobs.  Yeah I'm 21 I'm getting married.  Billy is my best friend since I was two years older.  Open up the envelope.  There's a note.  Dude I'm a little strapped.  I'm a little stressed.  I'm a little stressed.  There's a note.  Dude I'm a little strapped.  You know I love you.  I hope you and the wife do fine. 
[35:00]
 And the second I get back on my feet we're going out for a boo.  What happened to the $500 kick?  My friends are bummed.  That ain't happening.  Why I waited.  Yeah exactly.  All right we're not going to go to the booby bar tonight?  I don't know.  Like I said if I don't have plans we will go.  I probably have plans.  Should we call Jen and see if you're allowed to go to the booby bar?  Oh no.  Why?  No we don't want to call Jen.  Why?  I don't know. 
[35:30]
 I think when I left the house she was a little miffed at me or something.  Why would she be miffed at you?  I don't know.  There's something going on.  I'll get into it at a later date.  Actually when I pulled up today and I came into your house to pick you up today.  Yeah.  I felt a little tension in that house.  Was there?  I was going to discuss that with you.  Yeah it's something about Thanksgiving plans.  I don't know.  Now that I live down here and Jen's mom lived up there and now you know how the holiday  thing goes when you're married?  You have to commute every other holiday. 
[36:00]
 It's like odd even holidays.  Okay so Thanksgiving you go up there this year and then next year you're down here in  New York and then Christmas Eve is here and then you go up to Massachusetts.  All right now we're spending New Year's in Guam and then we're going to Tokyo.  I don't know where I'm going but I'm dealing with issues Opie.  You are.  Okay.  You are.  So if we have plans Saturday I won't see you. 
[36:30]
 I could be like your marriage counselor.  You want to get Jen on the line?  Oh that's good.  Your girlfriend's dating in Massachusetts and you're going to be my marriage counselor.  Opie's girlfriend is 200 miles away in Massachusetts dating and he's going to counsel me.  We'll both be dating I think.  I have to jump on a plane tomorrow just to make sure my girlfriend isn't screwing anyone.  I'm not going up there to see her.  Wow.  I just got to make sure that no one else gets to her.  You got to check your sheets. 
[37:00]
 Not your sheets because those can be washed.  Take the sheets off and check the mattress.  The mattress?  Feel around.  If you're feeling it's like all right let me.  Oh honey what have you been up to?  This isn't a hairball from the cat.  Right on.  1027 WNEW where Rock lives Dire Straits Lady Rider.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Got to say hi to everyone on their way to the Buffett show tonight or if you're in the 
[37:30]
 parking lot already partying and cranking out any W.  Hey what's up?  How are you?  All right.  What's going on?  So we're not allowed to go to the booby bar tonight Anthony?  I don't I think I have might have plans.  I don't have a clue.  And you think you have plans all this weekend so me and you can't hang out this weekend.  When you're in a relationship when you're married for some reason a guy's free time  gets dwindled down.  Okay.  And you have things called plans that are made with little or no knowledge to yourself. 
[38:00]
 Oh great.  All right.  Sorry.  Well the listeners want to know what the real problem is.  You were touching on something last break and nothing gets over the listener's heads.  They're like make Anthony explain what the problem is with this Thanksgiving thing.  All right.  Okay.  Oh boy.  Well we had a little tension in the relationship this morning.  I noticed that when I picked you up for work.  All right.  A little tension.  Yeah.  It seems that for Thanksgiving this year I have to drive up to Massachusetts for Thanksgiving 
[38:30]
 with Jen's mom because it's her year.  We alternate years with holidays.  My married people know what they're all talking about.  Okay.  And then I get back in the truck and me and Jen and Jen's mom and Jen's mom's aunt drive  down to New York to go see the Radio City Christmas show.  Okay.  That sounds like a lovely thing to do.  It's going to cost me a fortune.  Oh you got to pay for this whole thing. 
[39:00]
 Well yeah.  What do you got to pay for?  Like everything.  The tickets.  Yeah.  And then it's like.  Hotels.  I mean I love them and all but you know Amy Marge is a little old.  I'm not going to be getting from you know street to street very quickly.  Let's just say.  Oh no.  Why?  So and you just don't want to hang out with them for four days is that it?  You don't want to hang out with family members Anthony for four days? 
[39:30]
 Can I plead the fifth?  I would like to play the fifth on this issue.  I did not say that.  So you can't afford this lovely Thanksgiving thing that your wife has planned right?  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying Anthony?  What do you think?  Well they're not worth it or they hired us for millions of dollars here at NEW?  Please.  All right so you're on a budget?  Yeah.  All right.  Uh oh.  Watch.  Rick is giving me the sign that your wife said like four. 
[40:00]
 Oh come on.  Hi honey.  Hi.  Hey what's up?  Nothing what's up?  How you doing?  Fine how are you?  How was your day?  My day was lovely.  Did you get a job?  Not yet.  Are you still looking?  Yes.  I'm not even going to talk.  Opie detected some tension.  Some tension when he came in.  He was in the house for all of thirty seconds.  It didn't take long.  That's all it took.  Oh no come on we weren't fighting.  No.  I told you I wasn't going to have a conversation with you.  I didn't want to fight. 
[40:30]
 You stop giggling back there.  At least I'm not dating.  At least she's not dating.  Could you explain the situation?  Um sure.  Stop laughing.  It's not funny.  We're going up to Massachusetts for Thanksgiving.  Okay.  And then we're going to drive back down on Friday.  All right.  And my mom and my aunt are going to come back down with us. 
[41:00]
 Okay.  And spend the weekend with us down here.  And on Sunday we're going to go to Radio City Musical.  To see the Christmas show.  And it all sounds like a lovely time.  Isn't that nice?  Oh, be shut up.  Ask Anthony if he wigged out or not when I told him.  I didn't wig out at the plans.  Do you know what four people to the Radio City Christmas show cost?  It's like eight billion dollars.  Eight billion dollars?  To see a guy in a Santa suit and some crapping goats and llamas. 
[41:30]
 And the kickline girls that, oh, they look good from 20 rows back.  Because they're all about 60 years old now.  Well, that's good because we're like 25 rows back.  Oh, we have to because Auntie Mark is blind.  Well, now stop that.  We could just put a video of the thing and sit her in front of a big screen TV.  No, that's not fair.  It would be a little cheaper.  I love Auntie Mark.  We went over to the house one night with a bottle of Dom Perignon before we left.  It might as well have been Kool-Aid.  She didn't even know it was Dom. 
[42:00]
 I thought I was doing this real cool thing.  I guess Dom doesn't have the same effect after eight scotches.  Oh, no.  Now stop that.  You be nice.  And second of all, she didn't ask what we were supposed to do.  We did it in front of her face and go, oh, look, I brought a bottle of Dom over.  No, I guess it tasted like Boone's Farm apple wine.  Oh, you're very upset.  So now they're coming down Friday.  Where are they staying until Sunday?  I don't know yet. 
[42:30]
 I haven't spoken to Mom yet.  Maybe we'll just put them up at the Ritz in New York.  Sure.  Might as well just jack the whole fee up to a couple of grand.  Might as well.  Sounds like a great plan, honey.  Can we stay there too?  We could just buy a couple of beds and keep them in the house for cheaper.  No, we've got the cats.  Who's allergic to cats?  Annie Mark.  She made it 90 years allergic to cats?  Yes.  How old is Annie Mark?  She's 78, I think. 
[43:00]
 78.  I'm spending my Thanksgiving weekend in New York City with a 78-year-old woman.  Party time.  You are so lucky she can't hear you.  If she was here, she couldn't hear me.  Stop that.  What, Opie?  You're going to spend the weekend walking around the block with her?  Doing what?  Going to take the weekend just to walk around the block with her, Opie.  You people are very cruel.  That's very nice. 
[43:30]
 Cruel?  Yeah.  $2,000 worth of cruel.  Who said anything about $2,000 worth of cruel?  What do you think this weekend is going to cost me?  Well, you've got plenty of time to save up for it.  That's what you're working for now.  I know.  That's what I'm going to get a job for.  So I can save up so my mother and my aunt can have a nice little weekend in the city.  What, a year 2000?  Where are you going to work, flash dancing?  Jesus.  Anyway, I was calling to tell you we have no plans this evening.  We have none all weekend. 
[44:00]
 You can get a job.  I don't care.  I really can't.  You're screwed after that.  Wait, we'll all go.  I'll buy you a lap dance, hon.  We'll be home by 8.  See you later.  Bye.  It's all out in the open.  Cool.  That's great.  The Brian Sensor Orchestra Jump Jiving Well recorded live in the Imaginary Ballroom right 
[44:30]
 here on N.E.W.  Earlier today we had Semisonic in the Imaginary Ballroom.  They definitely rocked.  And well, they didn't really rock because they were acoustic.  They rocked.  You could rock.  You could rock.  You could rock.  Sure.  All right.  I wasn't sure.  Okay.  But the version they play in the Imaginary Ballroom will be playing from time to time  on N.E.W.  And I got to say hi to the crew that set up Semisonic today. 
[45:00]
 I felt so bad for those guys.  Two hours to set up.  At least two hours to set up.  Band comes in, does a quick sound check, plays some music.  And then leaves.  And then the crew had a breakdown for two and a half hours.  Time to close.  They set up a total of four and a half hours and the band played for four and a half minutes.  That's how it goes.  All right.  Topsy-turvy world of rock and roll.  Wow.  A lot of guys emailing about my wife calling it.  Yeah.  It says John from Jersey City says, Anthony, don't complain.  Your wife sounds much nicer than my ex.  During an argument about where to go to the bathroom, I was like, I'm going to go to the  bathroom.  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  And I was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I ended up banned from Thanksgiving that year, which actually turned out to be great. 
[45:30]
 I stayed home, ate what I wanted and got to watch the football games uninterrupted for  once in my life.  What's his name?  John from Jersey City. 
[46:00]
 John, you know, my new hero.  Yeah, without a doubt.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  It's getting late.  Matt Devote on your radio next.  What do you got tonight, Matt?  Oh, yeah.  Fastball will be at the Bowery Ballroom tomorrow.  And you got tickets?  No, Muni took them like you're Elton John.  I got Zam Fear at the Bowery Garage.  They take all the good tickets.  Yeah, we'll have a fastball a little bit later on.  Oh, very cool.  And tomorrow, are we doing Charlton Heston traffic one last time?  Yeah, if Chuck wants to bring his horses in.  All right.  We'll do that and we'll have more stupidity tomorrow. 
[46:30]
 Thanks for checking us out.
