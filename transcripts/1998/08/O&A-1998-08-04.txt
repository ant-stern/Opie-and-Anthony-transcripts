 And WNEW where Rock lives. Two for Tuesday, two from David Bowie. Moon Age Daydream from  Ziggy Stardust. Space Oddity before that. And we heard a couple from Eric Clapton, Mainline  Florida and Bad Love from Journeyman. Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hello. I got to start the show by saying how long  does it take to repair a pothole in this city of ours?  I don't even want to hear it. I was there. You were talking about the pothole on the  LIE. Yeah, well, the Grand Central. Well, I was listening to Wines just before 
[00:30]
 we started the show today to get some traffic and last minute news.  And they're still working on the pothole. Now, when I tuned in at 11 o'clock this  morning, they started working on the pothole. How long does it take?  I don't know. I was driving in and in the middle lane of the LIE, there is a hole  that's about three feet wide, a couple of feet deep. But it's a hole. They got the  traffic trucks out there, four guys, a traffic jam backed up miles. And one guy 
[01:00]
 is slowly shoveling tar into this. And this I heard on the news is two hours into them  starting. So two hours later, they have a hole half full of tar, traffic just backed  up for miles. And three other guys were standing there. Are they at least taking  turns with the shovel? I only saw the one guy, one guy. I mean, this is something  filling the hole. It's a hole. You learn this in elementary school in the playground. 
[01:30]
 Yes. How to fill a hole. It's not a technical thing. You take the material you're going  to fill the hole with. Stick with me here. This is where it gets complicated. You grab  a shovel, you take a few shovelfuls and throw it in the hole. Pat it down. Repeat. Until  the material is higher than was the hole. Is that too much? Three, four hours later, 
[02:00]
 traffic is still backed up. So how much longer did it take you to get in today? I don't  know. Quite a while. Another hour, maybe? Yeah, probably a tag on another hour. How  much wasted money is that? How much wasted work time? Wasted gas. You know what I think?  I don't care what you say because if you're a road worker, Department of Public Works,  whatever, and you're doing your job, then this goes right by you. I'm not even talking  about you. You are a stellar citizen in our society. You're working hard. But if you're 
[02:30]
 taking four hours to fill a hole, here's my idea. Every motorist has a four-foot long  cattle pride. When the traffic jam slowly goes by the cause, you have the right to  just zap the crap out of whoever is standing by that hole to wake them up. So they'll work  faster. They'll want the traffic going by a little quicker. If you're jolting them with  a cattle pride, that's my idea. I don't know if you agree. Now, I don't want to hear you. 
[03:00]
 I don't want to hear it because I'm not talking about the people doing their job.  Anthony, bitching again. I like this. This is how we start the show every day.  It's just one long bitch session, isn't it? I think a lot of people could relate to you today.  It's life. I was sitting there. I saw the looks on other people's faces as they passed by.  They weren't smiling, throwing flowers at the guy with the shovel. And when you're in a traffic jam  that bad, you know, that that that one is backed up that far. When you get to the site, you're  praying for carnage. Yeah, praying. You know what? I've been in this traffic jam for an hour and a 
[03:30]
 half. There better be blood and guts right on the highway. Someone better be dead. Someone better  be dead. But when you get there and you find it's a pothole that they're filling in, you get really  pothole fed. Four hours. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Two hours. Two hours to fill a pothole.  Give them time. Maybe they had a mix up. I don't know. Maybe they it took an hour just to figure  out which end of the shovel you use. I don't care. I'm giving them two hours, two hours,  but four hours. Maybe we should call the mayor. I think we had enough trouble with the mayor. 
[04:00]
 Well, it would be a good idea, though. He's much too busy getting fireworks off the street. Right.  The roads are secondary. Of course. Yeah. All right. Well, what do you want to do today? Give  us a call. 212-957-WNAW. That's the fax line actually in the phone line. 212-757-1027.  Coming back with some two first from Queen and Pearl Jam. Next. Stay there.  1027-WNAW, the Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday. Common and denominator there. Eddie Vetter, 
[04:30]
 Temple of the Dog, Hunger Strike and Pearl Jam alive. It's open. Anthony, you start them up today.  Phones are going crazy about that pothole on the Long Island Expressway. You were stuck in traffic  for an extra hour today because they had to fill in that pothole. Happens all the time, man. You  trying to get in wherever you're going and road work is happening. In this case, it was a pothole  like three feet wide, a few inches deep, and it took them four hours to fill this thing. I just 
[05:00]
 think that's ridiculous. There's no excuse for four hours. Well, it's the city workers, right?  They were on the job, obviously. Yeah, and I'm sure there's some good ones and whatever good city  workers are out there that can fix the roads. This isn't directed towards you. It's directed  to people that take four hours to fill a pothole. Well, we got a private contractor on the line.  What do you got, Mark? I'm in the Pave's Union, private. All right. It's 1018. It's New York City.  And it's separate from the city. Okay. Those guys are a nightmare. 
[05:30]
 You mean you agree, right? I got to agree because if you drive on a Cross Island Parkway at all,  they had paved that about two years ago. Yeah, it used to be a mess. Oh, it still is. Wait,  before you move on, how drunk were the workers when they repaved that road? It's a bunch of bumps.  It was at night. They must have been drunk. Yeah, when you're driving in that left lane,  all you're doing is hitting catch bases on the side. They made it worse. Those will throw you  right into the garden. But if we did that as private workers for the contract with the city, 
[06:00]
 we would never get paid for that job. Right. But the city has no inspectors on the job. Who  are they inspecting themselves? So how long do you think a pothole should take to fill?  That little pothole that they did, if they were out there more than 15 minutes, they were doing  nothing. 15 minutes! It took them four hours! A three by three pothole, six inches deep. Come  on, give me a break. They were doing nothing. I'm home now. I'm just pulling in my driveway, 
[06:30]
 so I just want to get that off my chest. Hey, have a good night. Take care. There he goes.  He says 15 minutes it should take. It tied up a major artery for four hours. That is my point.  I love this city.  1027W, N.E.W. Where Rock Lives on Two for Tuesday. Queen, Another One Bites the Dust and Fat Bottom  Girls. Good afternoon. It's Opie and Anthony. Thanks for checking us out once again today. 
[07:00]
 Yeah. It was quite a freak show on the way in today. What do you mean? That's why I love to  walk to N.E.W. because you never know what you're going to see on the streets of New York.  Out on the streets? What did you say? Well, on 65th, I saw this lady completely  passed out in front of someone's stoop with her shoes off. Oh, relaxing. Relaxing. I wish  I could nap in the middle of the day like that, openly on the streets. Some people can.  And then, oh, and then Central Park. Yeah. Right outside Central Park, there's a homeless guy in 
[07:30]
 his underwear. In his underwear? Not lying. Taking a bath in the drinking fountain.  He's just in his underwear, just splashing water all over his body and cleaning himself up.  A drinking fountain or a fountain like that? No, just a big, no, a drinking fountain.  A little drinking fountain. That fountain that thousands of people drink water out of today.  Yes. And probably after the guy was done. Yes. But at least the tour buses are getting smart.  They're starting to stop in front of all this. That's what people want to see. There was a tour 
[08:00]
 bus, you know, just completely stopped and all the tourists were with their cameras taking pictures  of this guy taking a bath in the drinking fountain. I'm like, great, they're getting wise,  finally, in this city. Who wants to see this stupid diner from Seinfeld? Let's move on to  the real stuff that's going on in this city. The back roads. Right. And then I'm at lunch with  Joe from Commie Central and we're hanging out. We got a window seat. There was a nurse  wheeling this old lady past a window. She had to be 97 years old. I guess, you know, 
[08:30]
 she was taking her for her, you know, lovely afternoon stroll. Sure, get a little sun.  It was all it was a head on a pair of legs. That's it. Now that's impossible. I swear to you,  she is so old that she's probably about three foot five now. Wow. Completely crunched down,  has no business living. I think she's a life hog. I think her time is done years ago. It's like when  you leave an apple out in August in August for like two weeks and it's all shriveled. That's what 
[09:00]
 she was like. It's like, what could she possibly be doing to help out society in 1998? Well,  Oh, but you have to have some compassion. The older people have lived their life. Yes.  Their best years are gone, but you know, we're a compassionate society where we have to take them  in and take care of them until the day comes. No, no, no. You consider them life hogs. There's  life hogs out there. People that have no business living anymore. Time to move on. Just breathing 
[09:30]
 air out with the old in with the new move on. Yes. They're taking up space, taking up air. Of  course. Wow. What a cruel man you are. You ever try to find an apartment in New York? Yeah, very  hard. Exactly. People have to die. Exactly. Get rid of a few of them. And then some of us will be  living in some sweet, sweet penthouse sweets. My goodness. Come on. She must've been something in,  you know, 1910. A flapper. A flapper. Yeah, exactly. That's sad when you look at some really, 
[10:00]
 really old people and just go, wow, you know, they were living it. Of course. Back then in the 20s  and 30s. And we're all going to get there if we're lucky, but I'm going to check out way before 97.  There's no reason to have some nurse, you know, strolling you around on eighth Avenue. It was.  If I'm walking around with those polyester pants pulled up to my nipples and the belt  and just put a slug behind the ear because I don't want to be like that, man. And you'll 
[10:30]
 have the wraparound sunglasses. Yeah. Those big dark wraparound sunglasses, the Terminator  sunglasses. Or if I'm scooting around on a little rascal. Here I am driving down the road on my  little rascal. Hello. Could you get out of my way, please? I'm trying to cross the street.  Excuse me. I'm a little rascal on my little rascal. And your pants are pulled up to your nipples. 
[11:00]
 Who needs that? Are you starting using that cane with the training cane on it? What's a cane isn't  enough. Now you need the four prongs on the end of it for a little stability or the Walker with  the wheels. The wheels, right. Defeats the purpose of a Walker. Of course. So sad. It is sad. They're  life hogs. All right. That's our opinion. Of course. I mean, you want it's your opinion.  I'll be I was just commenting on things I've seen. I'm not saying that old people should die. 
[11:30]
 They just happen to I'm not saying old people, but people that are very, very, very old. What's  what's the point? There are plenty of old people living very productive lives into their eighties  and nineties. I have no problem with those people. And there are other people that look like a head  with legs. Exactly. Exactly.  One oh two seven W. N. E. W. Where rock lives on two for Tuesday. Rush closer to the heart and the  spirit of radio. The who from quadrophenia bellboy and bargain from who's next. It's opiate Anthony 
[12:00]
 in a great mood. The show is flying and people are into it for now. What happened? There's a  woman on the phone, man. You kicked her off. What did I do? You can't get on the radio and say,  old people are life hogs. You can't say that an old woman that you saw in a wheelchair looked like  a head with legs without thinking somebody's going to call and be angry with you. I saw a lady and  all she had was a head and legs left. She was about 98 years old. They're a very productive 
[12:30]
 elderly people out there. Don't back battle now. And then there are others that, you know,  their better days are way behind them. Why are they living still life hogs? Maybe she misunderstood  you then. But she's she's angry and she's online for well, she want to talk to you.  I guess the management won't make believe you're the management.  Any W. Can we have you? I just have a comment to say I've been a loyalist in many years. 
[13:00]
 And I just wanted to speak my mind at that comment that that DJ said on the old people was really  disgusting. Excuse me. Which which comment was that? I was talking about the old people have  walking down the street. She has no body, just a head and legs and going on and on and on.  What did he mean by that? I don't understand. He was really insulting the elderly people  calling them life hogs. Life hogs. Right. Our DJs on the air actually said that an old person is  a life hog. Right. In a wheelchair has no business living and said that an old person looked like a 
[13:30]
 head with legs. Right. As he was eating at a restaurant. What do you what do you think  he meant by that? I don't know. I don't even get that. I don't. He was insulting elderly people  like they shouldn't be a part of society. Right. Could you hold on a minute? Sure.  I'm going to go and check this out. Hold on. I got a nice one. I said I was really  insulted. I really am. That makes me sick. It makes me want to cry. Like to hear people say  that you think people have a choice to be in a wheelchair. They don't have a choice. And what 
[14:00]
 do you think? Every person that 90 years old and older has been a wheelchair suicide. Hello,  miss. Yes. Yes. I've transferred you into the on air studio and I want to confront our DJs with  this because I didn't hear this. Okay. Opie? Yeah. What did he say, miss? He was referring to an  elderly people as life hogs in wheelchairs. Life hogs, Opie? I never said that. No. No one said that?  Miss, he's saying that he didn't say that. Well, someone said. No, I would never say something 
[14:30]
 like that. Well, someone said it. Did you say this, Opie? No, no. I said that there should be a new  sport where you use old people in wheelchairs at bowling alleys. No, that's not true. That's not true.  Someone was saying how they were sitting down at a restaurant at a window seat looking out the window  saying how you saw an old person who didn't even see the body, just a head and legs and they're  life hogs. Why should they eat them? Yeah, no, I don't even eat at restaurants so that could have  been made. That's unacceptable. I have elderly grandparents, Opie, and if you think this is the 
[15:00]
 way you're going to run your little radio show, you have another thing coming. We don't need our  listeners being subject to trash talk like that. Right. Am I right, miss? Yes, you are. This is  horrendous. We get this Opie and Anthony show in here like it's supposed to get ratings and all  they do is get on the air and talk about old people like that. I think it's horrible. That's  preposterous, miss. Okay. I agree with you wholeheartedly and we're getting to the bottom  of this and if we have to fire these two charlatans, we will. An apology would be appropriate. 
[15:30]
 I have a better idea. Yes. Would you like to come in and personally spank these two?  That wouldn't be necessary. Just wrap their butts red. That wouldn't be necessary. I'm not that angry.  I just wanted to speak my mind. With maybe a horse crop or something. No, that's okay. Or maybe a  Hot Wheels track. Those things hurt. You could do that if you want. That's okay. Although these  sick two would probably enjoy it. Maybe by someone else. Well, thank you for your complaint. We will 
[16:00]
 get to the bottom of this, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a satisfied customer.  Oh man, the phones are going crazy. We'll go to them next. 1027WNAW, the rock of New York.  It's two for Tuesday. Wallflowers, we'll get a go in here with heroes.  1027WNAW, the rock of New York. Two for Tuesday with the wallflowers. Sixth Avenue, Heartache and 
[16:30]
 heroes. Soapy and Anthony. Hey. Well, it's only fair now there's somebody on the line that's mad  at you. What did I do? Well, because you were bitching about how the city workers take so long  to fill in potholes. It took me an hour longer to get in here today because on the LIE there was a  three foot wide pothole in the middle of the LIE and it took them four hours to fill this thing.  All I'm saying is it shouldn't take four hours to fill a pothole. Oh, this guy on the phone says it 
[17:00]
 should take four hours. Get out of here. John, what's your problem? Let me explain something  to you there. I've been filling potholes with the city for the past 35 years and in that time I must  have filled a good five or six potholes. I got to tell you here it's not just dumping stuff in the  hole. Oh no, there's a whole science to this here. You got to stand there. You got to study that hole.  You have to romance that hole. You got to look into that hole and tell yourself what kind of hole 
[17:30]
 is this? I guess that's what takes so long. Let me explain something to you still there. Sometimes  it's a square pothole. Then you got your pear-shaped potholes. Then you got a marquee pothole,  a round pothole. There are a whole bunch of different kinds of potholes. I tell you there's  a category one pothole. That's where some bum c**k in it. You don't want to go and just fill up  over that stuff. They get to the water table at the mess. There's also the category two pothole.  That's when some bum crapped in the pothole. You don't want to go filling up over that stuff. 
[18:00]
 That's a real problem. That could cause trouble down the road if you know what I mean.  Did I straighten you guys out on this pothole business or what?  Completely straightened out. Thanks. Those are the words of a professional.  Okay. Very good then, boys. Carry on the good work.  And it looks like you just made $75 to talk to us today.  That's right. I'm working on a pothole right now. I'm figuring to finish up about 4 a.m. 
[18:30]
 We're still in the looking at it stage. All right. Get out of here.  Suicide Blonde and Need You Tonight 2 from InXS on 2 for Tuesday 1027 WNEW  where rock lives. Opie and Anthony, we got someone on the line that actually wants to defend us.  What's this us stuff, white man?  Oh, well, there are people out there that hate you for the pothole comment and there are people  out there that hate me about my life hog comment. I just think some people, you know, stay on the 
[19:00]
 earth way too long. Yeah. Living life and they're not productive. They've outlived their  grandchildren at this point. Yes. Thank you. I'm an elderly gentleman, please.  Excuse me. I have to get my little rascal three wheel scooter through here.  Excuse me, please. Could you help me? My battery's running out and I can't get up the ramp at the  corner of the roadway. I need a jump, please. And the sun is in my eyes and I don't have my big wide 
[19:30]
 sunglasses like the terminated war. Well, what's your name, sir?  They call my name Bill. They call my name's Bill.  Yes, please. Thank you. Hi, Bill. I have to get back to the home.  Bill, this is Manhattan. No one's going to help you if you're stuck on the on the side of the street.  Maybe a cab could push me. Would that work, please? Excuse me. Get out of my way, please.  I have to get to my active lifestyle that I have now with my little rascal. 
[20:00]
 Are you taking Viagra? They call my name's Bill. Yes. Yes. I take Viagra every day.  All right. Is it helping you out? No, my prostate's the size of a pineapple.  Not working too well for me. No. The wife loves it though. Why?  She's taking it. Why? I don't know. She just loves it. She likes the taste. It's like chewables.  Like chewables. Very good. Thank you, please. Out of my way.  Bye-bye. Thank you, please. There he goes. They call my name's Bill. I guess his name is or 
[20:30]
 something like that. But yeah, someone wants to defend us on the life hot comment.  How are you guys doing? Good. Lots of love being on the new show.  Hey, thanks, man. I've been listening to the station since  the start about 67. I think I was. Really? 46. I'm living in Staten Island. I'm on vacation.  I happen to be in the backyard with my son. I'm listening to your comments about the old people.  My comment is I work for the government. I'll leave it just like that in Brooklyn.  I want a person that's 84 years old that a few years ago they were doing what they call a reduction 
[21:00]
 of force, which means that government unfortunately gets rid of some people.  Right. And because of this, no age limit,  I won't point an 84-year-old woman that don't do jack, almost took mine and a few other young  people's job. So when you say they're life hogs, in some cases they are. And in some cases,  they're not productive. They should stay home and enjoy what life the good Lord gives them.  Instead of sucking the life out of us young people that still got to support our families.  There you go. See, we were having fun with this issue and you actually came up with a good point. 
[21:30]
 No, no, it's a fact. Believe me, I'm not putting anybody down. There's some people  that are in their 70s, 80s, God bless them, are very productive. But the people that just go to  work that are productive because they're allowed to go to work and take away jobs from younger  people that got to support families, they are what they call life sucking hogs, as you were saying,  around the way. There you go, man. See, nothing else to say. Thank you. Thank you. It's cool.  Talk to you. All right. Bye bye. 
[22:00]

[22:30]
 I'm going to sit in line and I'm going to pay the toll man.  Can't be that much longer.  Yeah.  Right.  In the easy pass?  Well, they're forcing everyone to get the easy pass because how many toll boots are available for,  you know, cash only right now? 
[23:00]
 One or two.  One or two. And how many lanes for easy pass?  All the rest.  Yeah, exactly.  Doesn't matter where you are. And I like how they change where the cash lanes are every few weeks.  Yeah.  Like all of a sudden, I'm coming over the throbs neck bridge. All right. I know that the cash lanes  are all to the right. So you squeeze all the way to the right and you're like, oh my God,  it's easy path. I got to get to the left. Oh, now I'm the idiot that's trying to cut in from  the easy pass lane. The guy you want to kill.  What about the dork that, you know, assumes that the easy pass lane is just another lane 
[23:30]
 that's going faster?  Yeah, this one's fast.  This is a real fast lane. I'll just go in here and pay the toll real fast.  Then they realize and try to cut in.  Yeah.  It gets like the road warrior at that point. You just want to start shooting at people.  Talk about a road raid. You cannot get closer to the guy's bumper in front of you.  They try to tell the guy that's cutting in that you're not getting in here.  There's a science to that too. Oh, I'm not letting this guy in. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  They pull a little forward in front of you. How far are you away from them as they're pulling away? 
[24:00]
 Like a half an inch.  Half an inch.  No, no, no, no, no. When a foot would do. You know, there's no way they're going to squeeze  in either way.  But then when you're the other guy that's trying to get in and you know you made a legitimate  mistake and you just need someone to help you out.  You turn and you go, look at me. Look at me.  The guy's like looking straight ahead. I'm not looking at you. I'm not looking at you.  I am two inches from the bumper in front of me and I'm not even going to glance at you  because if I make eye contact, I'm going to have to let you in.  So I'm not looking at you.  And you're trying to get in. You're peeping the horn. You're having your  girlfriend show her boobs or something. Anything to make him notice you. So you get in there. 
[24:30]
 I'm the guy that's constantly talking to the people in other cars.  And look at this guy. Would you look at this guy? He thinks he's going to get you're not getting in.  You're not getting in. Don't let him in.  Why are you letting him in?  Would you look at this idiot? Letting him in.  He cuts in front of everybody. We wait online. This jerk lets him in. 
[25:00]
 You want to kill the guy that let him in.  So true. So true. I learned something about easy pass today, too.  What?  Did you know that they can handle fourteen hundred cars in an hour?  The easy pass lanes.  Right.  And the man made tollboots can handle three hundred cars an hour.  Hmm.  Wow.  Trying to get one of those passes.  I think it's time.  One oh two seven W.A.W. where rock lives.  Brian Setzer with his old band the Stray Cats and Built For Speed and the new one from the  Brian Setzer Orchestra Jump Jive and well tickets still available for the July 16th show. 
[25:30]
 Go get him.  Hammerstein ballroom.  Going to be good.  That's right. Hammerstein.  Hammerstein.  Hammerstein.  Hammerstein ballroom.  Man, you hit a nerve with the easy pass.  You think? Oh, by the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're having a good day today. A lot of people are starting to react to the show.  That's what we're trying to build here slowly but surely.  Damn. When we're talking about something, feel free.  If it hits a nerve, you call in or throw us an email or a fax and we'll get to you. 
[26:00]
 Definitely. What did that guy say that was on the phone?  Yeah, it was just on the phone, man. Joe from Jersey called up and said he agrees 100 percent  about a pain in the butt it is when you're going through easy pass and somebody doesn't have easy  pass. It stops the whole lane up. Of course. People are flying through this thing pretty good.  You get on a line up your little aisle there. You get behind somebody and the gate doesn't open.  And he says you should just they should have a crew that just comes out and clubs the guy. 
[26:30]
 The door out of the guy and confiscates his vehicle for the state for just the one lousy  mistake of getting in the easy pass lane when it shouldn't have been.  Beat him. Beat him. Maybe Giuliani could work on that.  You get some of those construction workers from last week. I'm sure they're up for the job, right?  I'm sure. Why not? Oh, I got to bring up something with you.  Your favorite comedian of all time was on Letterman last night.  I know Adam Ferrara is my favorite comedian. He was not on Letterman. 
[27:00]
 Who are you talking about? Oh, Louis Anderson. I thought you  like Louis Anderson. Shut up.  What? No one likes Louis Anderson. I thought you were a fan of Louis Anderson.  I am a big fan. Louis Anderson. He was on Letterman?  Yeah. He's got to be the most unfunny guy in the world.  Let me tell you something. I don't know how he got to be  under the label comedian. Well, let me tell you something.  I was watching. It was painful. The audience wasn't laughing. 
[27:30]
 I like to torture myself, so I sat through it even though it sucked.  It's horrible. All he talks about is how he used to be abused.  My father. Yeah, let me tell you, growing up, my father was an alcoholic.  He used to beat me all the time. Oh, Louis, stop. You're killing me.  Louis, that's hysterical. Back in the schoolyard, I was fat,  and now he's getting beat up by the other kids. 
[28:00]
 Louis, stop. I'm cramping up over here. You're just hysterical. Talk more.  Did any of your family die? That would be a great bit.  I can't believe it. I sweat all the time.  Do some more self-deprecating fat humor. If I didn't sweat, I'd explode.  Don't forget about his alcoholic father.  It's always, you know, my father was drunk all the time and used to beat me and my 
[28:30]
 brothers and sisters. I couldn't run because I was so fat.  Is that comedy? The guy is constantly talking about how he was abused.  I'm sorry to hear about it, but where's the jokes?  How did he get a cartoon? How did Louis Anderson get a cartoon?  A Saturday morning cartoon, Life with Louis.  So now he could teach all the kids those life lessons. 
[29:00]
 If you've watched the cartoon, I've had to watch it because I had to see what was going on here.  His father is in the cartoon. The one that used to beat him?  My drunk and alcoholic abusive father who used to beat me about the head.  He's in it as this big, overbearing general character.  So he couldn't even fake it for a cartoon. It's a kid's cartoon, Louis.  You don't have to put your real-life horrors into a kiddie cartoon. 
[29:30]
 My cartoon father beats me. My cartoon friends beat me up in the schoolyard.  I saw in the store, Life with Louis, Louis Anderson SpaghettiOs.  Louis Anderson SpaghettiOs?  I swear to God, SpaghettiOs with a picture of Louis on it.  Is anyone going to eat that?  It's Fun Shape like a fat kid getting whacked over the head by his drunken dad. 
[30:00]
 Fun Shape. I'm not eating anything that comes out of Louis' can.  I'm still going.  Rock and roll fantasy before that. It's Opie and Anthony.  What are you laughing at over there?  I'm laughing at some of the email.  Yeah, we set up this thing through the WNEW website where you could jot a message to us 
[30:30]
 right here in the studio.  We get it instantaneously.  Yeah, you don't have to wait for us to get off the air and then punch up our email and read all  the hate mail that way. You could actually send your hate mail direct to us.  We can read it directly.  We can read it seconds after you hit send.  WNEW.com. You click on our pictures.  The pictures is what they're talking about here in this one.  Howie, Jason and Amy. Dad and the kids. Love the show. 
[31:00]
 Well, thank you. But wonder why Opie is wearing an apron in his baby picture.  I got to straighten this out. Anthony.  Yeah, Anthony doesn't like Tony.  I never liked Tony.  I don't like Opie, but I'm stuck with it.  It's not a goofy radio name like everyone thinks. I got the name when I was 12.  And that baby picture, first of all, I was four years old. My mom was still dressing me.  I had nothing to do with putting my own clothes on yet. 
[31:30]
 It's a great look, man. You got this polka dotted suspender apron thing going.  Hey, Mr. Velour, man.  I know. It says Tony, is that a WNEW Velour rock shirt?  I don't know why, but I'm dressed like something from Rigel 7 on Star Trek.  You look like a Star Trek kid.  I know. My mother put me in this blue Velour shirt.  Look like a monster or something. John Gotti wear.  This guy shouldn't talk because we all have those pictures.  We're very embarrassed of. 
[32:00]
 Of course. Class pictures are the worst too.  As you went through school and your parents line them up in the collage that goes in the hallway.  Like you in second grade, third grade, fourth grade with the,  oh, this is my bad hair year.  Oh, this one. Yeah. Oh, acne. Yeah.  Oh, this is good. Yeah. This is the one where I was wearing beads.  Yeah. Yeah.  Decided beads was a good thing.  Oh, great. Here's my prom picture, the three-piece suit with the bell bottoms. 
[32:30]
 Great. Yeah.  Remember everyone got a comb on picture day.  I'm trying to tell you something.  So the worst is though, when they use your high school picture.  Yeah. When you get arrested or something.  That's why I never had mine taken in high school.  I ran anytime the photographer came in high school because I knew that's the picture they're going to  use when you get in a fiery crash or you get arrested or when you say the mayor's dead.  Yeah. Yeah. That one too.  I don't want that.  No, I don't want that. 
[33:00]
 It's like tilted head smiling picture.  You want a picture of you swilling a beer or something and going down in a blaze of glory.  It's like, how did the news stations get, get my high school picture and why is it on the screen?  I must've done it was just an April fool's joke.  Horrible little inside humor for y'all brother.  Hey, there's a lady on the line. We could either talk to her now.  Yeah. You want to talk to her now?  What does she want?  Supposedly she's got some claim number for a prize. 
[33:30]
 She thinks we're not giving anything away.  I know, but I guess she's calling one of those prize patrol places and with her claim number,  she's claiming she won a pretty hefty prize.  Want to mess with him?  Eddie W.  A question about Eddie Van Halen.  Yeah.  If you guys can answer it. Was he the first guy to use two hands up the neck of the guitar?  No, definitely not.  No, definitely not. Nikki Pickup. Come on.  We got a bump going on in my office. Who was the first guy to do that? 
[34:00]
 Actually, Jimi Hendrix did.  Do we have both of you on the line?  Pick it up. Pick it up.  All right. Hey, go ahead. He's on the line now.  All right. Now what do you say, bud?  The sliding up and down the neck of the guitar with the two hands going back and forth up and  down the neck of the guitar.  Eddie Van Halen was the first guy. Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Why? You just dropped me. I got him.  No, no. It was Jimi Hendrix, man.  Oh, wait, wait. I got the other guy. I said Jimi Hendrix.  I thought Jimi Hendrix did that in 1968. 
[34:30]
 He did. Everyone knows that.  Get that other clown.  Hey, pick it up. Pick it up.  Hi.  Hello?  Hello.  Yeah. Everyone knows Eddie Van Halen in that play.  Thank you. Everybody knew that Eddie Van Halen was the first one to do that.  Dude, what is that guy?  It's all right.  Obviously, it's Hendrix.  It's got to be Hendrix.  It's Hendrix again.  Tell the guy it's Hendrix. Put him on the phone, that jerk.  Get him on the phone. Is the other guy on the line?  Wait a second.  Check it out. Check it out, man. 
[35:00]
 All right. Hold on. Here it comes.  All right.  We got like 10 guys listening to this.  Are you on the line?  Yeah.  All right. Let's set everyone straight. It was obviously Eddie Van Halen.  So why do you keep doing that?  Because you see it in a deck.  It was Hendrix.  All right.  Lots of requests coming in for Dave Matthews today.  Let's do it, twofer.  Crash into me.  1027WNEW, the rock of New York.  It almost happened. 
[35:30]
 The rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  Two for Tuesday, Dave Matthews band.  Stay and crash into me.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  Your brother's on the phone.  Yeah. My brother Joe. What does he want?  Tell him I'm broke.  Well, we got in that discussion.  Who was the first guitarist to use two hands up and down the neck?  Right. Like Eddie Van Halen does.  Right.  And I thought Jimi Hendrix did it.  Right.  And there was an argument on the phone.  We had a couple of guys who were betting each other. 
[36:00]
 One said Jimi Hendrix did it.  One said Van Halen did it.  My brother pretty much knows everything about guitar players.  So he might be able to clear this up.  Joe!  Who was the first one to use double hand taps?  Joe.  Listen to me. Now, listen to me. Listen carefully.  This is how it went. Jimi Hendrix never did that.  Never.  Not once. Never did it.  Eddie Van Halen was the first one to bring it out front, make it obvious what he was doing.  But the first guy was one of Eddie Van Halen's very, very early influences, 
[36:30]
 a jazz guitar player by the name of Django Reinhardt.  Oh my.  Django Reinhardt.  Django Reinhardt from the 20s. He was popular back in the 20s.  And he was a gypsy from, where the hell was he from?  From like Yugoslavia or something.  And he was a guitar player and he had three fingers on his left hand.  I f*** you not, man. This is all for real.  And he is listed as like one of Eddie Van Halen's biggest influences, Django Reinhardt. 
[37:00]
 If anyone ever asks again, we'll have to remember Django Reinhardt.  That's the guy.  Django Reinhardt.  Yep.  Thanks.  Well, Joe cleared that up. Thanks.  So you can learn something on the Opie and Anthony show every afternoon from three to seven.  Yeah. Real resume stuff or information there.  You want to learn about squids?  Squids. I'm very fascinated about this.  I was at Comedy Central today, hanging with my bud Joe,  and he has this article up on his bulletin board from the USA Today. 
[37:30]
 This is serious scientific stuff.  Not the Globe or the choir?  None. None of the trash magazines. It was in USA Today.  And I'm reading this thing and I'm like fascinated.  So I decided to bring it in and share it with our fine listeners.  Little marine biology lesson.  Yes. For squids, mating is a shot in the dark.  Listen to this.  Scientists report that they have solved one of the mysteries of the deep sea,  how the giant male squid mates with the female.  Oh, thank God. My tax dollars are going to that. Thanks God.  I know. You think you got a bad look at this. 
[38:00]
 This is a tale that proves fact is stranger than fiction.  The giant male squid measures 45 feet long and would make calamari rings bigger than a tractor tire.  Males and females live in a dark and solitary environment  up to 3000 feet below the ocean surface.  Scientists believe that encounters between these creatures,  whether male or female, are chance and very, very infrequent. 
[38:30]
 But it seems that giant squid deal with the solitary lives by making the most of rare  encounters with the opposite sex. They don't see them often, so they got to take advantage of the situation.  Sounds like my life back in the dating days.  Yeah, exactly.  Take what I can get.  What the male squid does to get its, you know, juice into the female.  Right.  The male uses an extremely muscular penis that is three feet long and functions like a rivet or nail gun.  Really?  Yeah.  This was in USA Today.  Yes. Nature had this design in mind for a purpose because, you know, 
[39:00]
 it doesn't see the females that often, so it uses like a rivet or a nail gun.  Okay.  All right.  That means the male, when passing a female like two ships in the night,  quickly maneuvers to hammer its penis into the female's arms and injects its seed under hydraulic pressure.  Come on.  I swear to you.  The female then stores the sperm in her skin until she spawns once and dies.  It sounds so romantic.  There's the cool part, though. Now, sometimes accidents occur in dark depths.  Males have been found with similar, you know, seed in them 
[39:30]
 by a co-suitor with poor aim.  That's horrible.  And one male was found who may have literally shot himself in the foot.  So there you go.  That could happen sometimes if you're walking down Christopher Street.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with Foreigner.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Matt Devote in the corner. 
[40:00]
 Happy anniversary, bud.  Thank you.  You don't look happy about it.  I'm very happy.  I just went through the horror of trying to find the right card, though.  My wife Laura, my lovely Laura, and honey, if you listen, shut the radio off.  Because I don't want you to hear this.  You know what she's going to do now?  She's going to turn it up.  I wait until like today to go find a card.  And you know, any guy can relate to this.  She going to find this wall of cards and it breaks down to like three basic categories.  Honey, I'm an absolute loser, idiot, pilot junk. 
[40:30]
 I was a drooling moron until I met you when you made something out of me.  Now, I don't know who would buy that, but you know, they must buy them  because they keep printing them.  Sure.  It's the guilt card.  Right.  Then you got the then you got the hunt, you know, I'm the macho guy, you know,  you know, dear sweetheart of all the women I've had sex with, you're one of the best.  I was like, yeah, it's really impressive to your wife.  Then I fell into the third category, the one with the poem that's so long and like, 
[41:00]
 you don't know what it means by the time you're done.  It's so confusing and in depth and nobody wants to admit that they don't get it.  Right.  Oh, that's nice.  I'd really appropriate, you know, but that's a trap though.  Because two years ago, there's a guy repo in my car.  I'm going with the, he goes, look, you signed it, man.  It's right on there.  My card.  You know, you got to read the fun.  You know, the heaven's part, you know, the angel smear cherubs all over the Baltic stage. 
[41:30]
 You're like, what is it?  So I bought one of those out, you know, you sign it and I hope she's listening, you know.  Yeah.  I'll see you later.  I get an envelope first and then just find a card that fits it.  That's, that's how I pick cards.  The worst thing, you ever have to pick out a card for your wife to get for someone else?  And while you're there, could you get a card for my father for his birthday?  Wait a minute.  Now I got a sister and dear daddy, I love you so much. 
[42:00]
 Oh no, I got to bring this up to the counter.  And whatever it is, it's the wrong sentiment when you're done.  You take it home.  This is wrong.  It's all plagiarism.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Sure.  Oh, this is so sweet.  Yeah.  I wrote it myself.  Oh, well.  Well, you're up next or?  Yeah.  You?  Yes, I am.  We never know who's following us these days.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  The DJ wheel.  All right.  In the wheel.  Hey, Matt's up.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We'll be on the radio again tomorrow at three o'clock. 
[42:30]
 Matt Devote on the radio next to continue two for Tuesday.  We got two here from the talking heads.  We'll send this one out to Florida.  One oh two seven WNW, the rock of New York.
