 I want to know how much heroin Jimmy was doing.  You know that song is very cool. 
[00:30]
 The first four and a half minutes and then it sounds like a train wreck at the end, doesn't it?  Oh, oh, oh.  1027WIW where rock lives, two from Jimi Hendrix.  That was Jimmy's thing.  That was Jimmy playing and then he was trying to shake the needle out of his arm with the guitar.  It was just like, whoa, Jimmy. 
[01:00]
 Six was nine and purple haze, it's Opie and Anthony.  Are we going to put Steve Mason on the radio to support the President of the United States of America?  Yeah, what's your official stand on this? Are you a libertarian?  Well, first of all, who are you?  Yeah, wait a minute.  All I am is WNAW listener.  Oh, okay. That's it.  All right.  You're just a listener.  Wanted in off the streets.  All right.  Because I was pissed off.  All right.  Because you guys are such prudes about this thing. 
[01:30]
 Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Prudes?  Yeah, you're prudes.  You're like young guys.  You're supposed to be...  All right, wait, let me make this statement, okay?  My rock stars, you know, my favorite rock stars, I want to see them banging broads backstage and interns and stuff,  but I don't want to know that the President of the United States is eating pie in the Oval Office.  He comes from a long line of presidents who have had extramarital affairs, right?  Who the hell cares? Why is this the guy that we're going to make an example of? 
[02:00]
 I'll tell you why, because he's picking the wrong women.  They're all...  You know, if you want to sleep with Linda Tripp, I would have said impeach him.  Impeach the guy if he sleeps with Linda Tripp.  I mean Kennedy at least had the respect to do starlets in Hollywood broads. This guy is doing it with pangs.  That's why I don't respect him. I think we should impeach him on that point alone.  But you don't really think we should impeach him.  Yeah.  You really think we should impeach him?  He's a lame duck president now.  Every president after six years is a lame duck president.  This is a little different. When she says Steve, I think he's... 
[02:30]
 No, Reagan after six years was stuck in the Iran-Contra controversy. This guy's stuck in...  I never said, wait a minute...  So to speak.  I never remembered anything about Iran-Contra.  But I do know that when I slept with broads, it was always with mommy's approval.  I think it looks bad in the eyes of the rest of the world.  It does look bad in the eyes of the rest of the world.  This guy can't control his libido.  Clinton doesn't look bad in the eyes of the rest of the world. 
[03:00]
 We look bad with the way we're reacting.  Oh, come on.  So you're saying, then bring on the trapeze in the Oval Office.  No, seriously.  Bring out the gimp.  Where's the presidential leather mask with the rubber ball in the mouth?  François Mitterrand, when he died, the Prime Minister of France, when he died,  at the front row of the funeral, front row seats at the funeral, wife, mistress, daughter, together.  But did he go on TV and lie about it when he was confronted with the issue?  Did George Bush lie about it when he said, read my lips, no new taxes?  Of course he did.  Well, all these politicians lie. 
[03:30]
 We should throw them all out.  We should throw them all out.  We should throw them all out.  We should throw them all out.  Not except the fact that politicians lie about it.  Get used to it.  No, I'm not going to get used to that.  Say what I have to do to get elected.  But I want to go back to the France thing.  Yeah.  You're using France as an example.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the president can screw around and look at how it happens.  Nazis come in without a fight.  They take over the whole damn country.  Yeah.  See?  You don't want that.  Oh, there's a real strong image.  Wait a minute.  This thing about compromising national security.  Absolutely.  By getting a hummer from Monica, are you out of your mind? 
[04:00]
 He shows his weakness to the world.  It's the thin spot of the hole.  Wait, it's the thin spot on every guy's hole.  Wait, wait, we don't know for sure if there was a Scud missile up Monica's, you know what,  that big focus of hers.  We don't know for sure if she was smuggling something in there.  Monica was not a spy.  He didn't compromise national security by...  Well, now he is, though.  She could have been trying to gather up DNA so they could clone the president, 
[04:30]
 brainwash him and switch him with the one we have now.  Yeah, and on top of everything else.  Then there'll be trouble.  I mean, if you get a dirty dress, seriously, if you got a dirty dress, why the hell don't  you take that thing into the dry cleaners?  What the hell is she doing with that thing?  Pressing it like a prom corsage in a book.  She's just, she's running around looking for married men to sleep with.  Well, the dress is the whole reason that the president had to finally confess.  He was going to deny, deny, deny, but someone obviously got to him and said, oh, right.  But yeah, the polls got to him and said, none of us really care.  His poll was getting everybody else.  And I love how everyone comes out. 
[05:00]
 Look at you now.  I see you knocking Monica a little bit.  No, no, no, not knocking Monica.  Oh, yeah, sure.  I see a lot of these guys.  Who can say the adults should get her in the right light?  I kind of like her.  Yeah, doesn't she have kind of a look?  No, not enough.  I like the shot where she has her bedroom eyes open.  No, I would absolutely put her on my staff.  There you go.  I say not enough beer in the bar.  It was last call in the Oval Office.  Yeah, I was looking around.  Who could I ask? 
[05:30]
 Well, you're the only one around.  He's left.  Yes.  So are you guys going to get off your prude attitude?  Prude?  Is that even the issue?  I certainly don't care.  Hillary Clinton wrote his speech last night?  Wow.  Where did you find that out?  New York Times.  Where?  New York Times on this show?  New York Times, right here.  New York Times, A-15, today.  I must have missed this as I was picking up the inquiry.  Hillary Clinton wrote his speech for him.  Really?  That's a marriage of convenience.  Of course.  We all know that.  That's obvious.  That's been obvious for many years.  They made a deal a long time ago. 
[06:00]
 She knows he's screwing around.  I don't know.  She doesn't care.  And I don't have a problem with that.  I have a problem with him lying to the American people.  What's the difference between that and read my lips, no new taxes?  It's just, let's see, what is the difference?  And then he raises taxes.  That was Bush.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What do you think that's different than being able to control your swine?  You know?  I think that is different.  Right.  And what's the difference between, it didn't cost me any money, Bush raised taxes, that  cost me money.  Circumstances dictated, a raise in taxes. 
[06:30]
 What can you say?  How can circumstances dictate that he's got to dictate?  It's a little different, I think.  Politicians lie, guys.  Get used to it.  All right, so let's just keep going and, you know, maybe a few more presidents down the  line will have the trapeze of sex in the Oval Office.  I think we will.  And it will be perfectly fine.  I think we will.  All right.  Unless we elect a new president, we'll have to have a new president.  We'll have to have a new president.  We'll have to have a new president.  We'll have to have a new president.  We'll have to have a new president.  I think we will.  All right.  Unless we elect Gore, because I don't think he says sex in the news.  That's a different kind of stiff in the Oval Office.  There you go.  All right, Seymour, thanks for coming up off the streets, I guess.  Yeah, thanks.  Security.  Security.  Anthony's Clinton song on the way because we wasted too much time here, so we'll do  that next time we talk.  Stay there.  Wow, we are making people think today.  You know what the whole thing is? 
[07:00]
 We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[07:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[08:00]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[08:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She goes, ìHmm, on the public airwaves you could use terms like ìeating bad pieî in  the Oval Office.î Now I didnít say that Liz, that was open.  Thanks Anthony.  Yet you condemn a public official for what heís doing in his private life.  Wait a minute, are you trying to compare what we do here, our little goofy show on N.E.W. 
[09:00]
 to what the President of the United States does here?  Liz, thatís silly.  The problem is the President is acting like a goofy DJ.  Heís doing broads and smoking pot and not hanging with his wife.  Thatís what radio guys do.  Compare our jobs to the Presidentís.  Oh, what do you got there?  Whatís that button?  I got lots of buttons over here.  Does that play Johnny Lang or does it launch a cruise missile?  I think it plays Johnny Lang.  I bet.  What does that one do? 
[09:30]
 Does that bring up the ìOh my God, donít hit it!  Iím sure something will blow up!î I donít think itís all that serious what we do here.  I.A.W.  I am tired of people insinuating that I am ignorant for caring that our President has  no integrity.  Thatís how everybody seems to be reacting.  Isnít that silly?  Itís ridiculous.  I mean you have to look up to the President of the United States and he has to have certain  qualities which are outstanding.  Heís got to be respected as a leader. 
[10:00]
 I cannot believe how many people donít see that.  It doesnít matter how this got out, why it got out or even the lying, whatever.  He comes across now as not looking like a leader that can lead the most powerful nation  on the globe.  Well, letís face it.  I mean he lied about smoking marijuana too.  Heís been lying since he started running for Governor of Arkansas.  Exactly.  Itís very, very embarrassing.  He lost his credibility a long time ago but I think this is the final straw right here. 
[10:30]
 Yeah, I hope so anyway.  Heís got no scruples.  Yes, and I think people should care about that and I think thatís the point.  I think itís like everything is reversed from the olden days where people used to care  about stuff like that.  Now itís like out of vogue to care about morals and integrity.  Yeah.  And thatís a sad state of affairs.  What are we teaching our children?  He wants to put V-chips.  Remember Bill Clinton wanted to put the V-chip in our TV and theyíve been putting it in 
[11:00]
 so that the children can watch a sexually oriented TV show.  Exactly.  Heís got to have a V-chip on his fly.  Yeah, exactly.  Now thereís an article in the paper, ìHow to tell your kids about what happened with  Bill and Monica.î Great.  Oh, is there really?  Yeah.  Thatís funny.  Oh, thatís funny.  Youíre telling your kids what little dolls Bill did and he touched her where her bathing  suit covers. 
[11:30]
 They had a little secret.  Oh my God, that is so funny.  You see, he was trying to find the little canoe driver.  Okay guys, well thanks for listening.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Hey, we only have 20 minutes before we got to give the other side of this whole thing.  Well look at this, Andrew from Manhattan, when did you guys turn into such prudes?  Alright, well at 5 oíclock weíre going to completely change our take on this.  Yeah, of course we are. 
[12:00]
 At least the people are getting it.  We played the other angle on purpose here.  So we got 20 more minutes and then we totally change our take on the story, donít worry.  Yeah, so stick around for that.  And if it fits too.  Thatís okay.  Hereís a song that Anthony and his brother Joe did over the weekend.  I think this is why Clinton confessed.  There you go.  Weíre 15 minutes away before we have to change our opinion on the Bill and Monica thing.  So if youíre against Clinton, you have 15 minutes to call us and have us agree with you. 
[12:30]
 And then weíre going the other route.  Right, then at 5 oíclock whoever tunes us in for the first time is in for a big surprise.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Itís Two for Tuesday with REM.  My pants go down when they go up again, except when Hillaryís around.  My pants go down when they go up again, except when Hillaryís around.  She runs this town.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday. 
[13:00]
 I like that one.  Iíve got to thank the gang from Capitol Steps for sending us a copy of their ìUnzipping My Dudaí.î  Theyíre playing a couple tracks off that today on the program.  Instant email, Z-Man from Queens.  I donít think he likes us.  Well, most people donít.  He says weíre hypocrites.  You know what?  You never cheated on your wife?  I know.  In the four years Iíve known Anthony, he hasnít cheated on his wife.  Lord knows Iíve tried to get him on the women, but he has always said no. 
[13:30]
 Thatís like Z-Man trying to justify his probably cheating all the time.  What, you never did?  Everyone does, right?  No, Anthony doesnít.  No, I havenít yet.  Iím still looking.  All right.  Well, weíve got to change our opinion in four minutes anyway.  So Z-Man, youíre going to like the second half of the show today.  Yeah.  Because we know people only check our program out for 15 or 20 minutes at a time.  So the next time we talk, weíre going to be pro-Clinton.  Yeah, because weíve been bashing Clinton for two hours. 
[14:00]
 So now weíre going to be on his side for the next two hours.  So weíve taken some heat from the people that support Clinton.  So now weíll just change.  We donít care.  Yeah, we donít care.  Youíve got no agenda.  You think we care?  No.  We donít have any scruples.  No.  Just like the President of the United States.  He has no scruples and we donít have any scruples.  Hey, you canít badmouth him.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, you got four minutes left.  Weíre going to still badmouth him for a couple more minutes and then weíve got to change  our opinion here.  So I say impeach him and throw him out of office.  Yeah, that pervert.  Thatís right.  All right.  Heís lost his credibility. 
[14:30]
 Yep.  Heís hurting the country is what it is.  Yes, thatís right.  What about the children?  Yeah.  What about the children?  Yeah, children.  How can he set an example for children in this country?  Theyíre going to grow up and be perverts just like him.  Yeah, family values.  Yeah.  I say family values all the way.  Yeah.  V-chips for everyone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thatís it.  All right.  Next time we talk, weíll be on his side.  Okay.  On the way, weíll goóoh, some zeppelin?  Cool.  Weíll do that by request and rush next. 
[15:00]
 Stay there.  1027W on EW where Rock lives, 2 for Tuesday with Led Zeppelin down by the seaside, heartbreaker,  live and love and made before that.  Itís Opie and Anthony.  Iím looking at the CNN webpage and I see that the President and Hillary have boarded  the helicopter thatís going to take them out of Washington and take them on vacation  to Marthaís Vineyard for the next two weeks.  Our friend Footís got a good little fact here. 
[15:30]
 Mr. President, you just admitted in front of the whole country that youíre an adulter  and a liar.  Now what?  Iím going to Disney World.  People have been calling and faxing and emailing and they want to know our opinion on the whole  thing.  Our stance on this whole thing.  So I guess we should pipe in with our views, right?  Yeah, quite frankly, I think he came clean, admitted this in front of the people which  took a lot of courage.  Yes, I agree. 
[16:00]
 And it is a privacy issue.  Yeah, definitely.  Thatís how it should be dealt with.  I donít think this is an issue that the American people should be involved in.  And heís a good President.  We should leave it at that and Ken Starr should back off.  Of course, heís a great President.  What happened?  I just lost my thought.  Sorry, this is a serious issue.  Just speak from the heart.  Obviously the truth will come out.  Yeah, and who cares if he lied about it?  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President. 
[16:30]
 He didnít lie either.  Thatís not lying.  He just kept certain details from people.  But thatís not lying.  Yeah, thatís true.  I hate hearing when the Republicans come out and say that.  That heís lying.  But besides, all politicians lie.  Thatís true too.  And letís face the fact.  The country runs itself.  Do we really have to worry about that?  Yeah, and that thatís an issue.  Heís a strong enough leader that if something comes up, he can handle it.  Right.  I donít think heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Heís a good President.  Right.  You know, I donít think we should get back to the business of running this country and 
[17:00]
 not spending our tax dollars on a witch hunt.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  We could have solved the homeless problem in New York with the money they spent on this  investigation.  Yeah.  And besides, everyone cheats.  Right.  Everyone in America cheats.  Yeah, if you cheat and youíre approached, youíre going to say yes?  Yeah, exactly.  No, heís a human being.  Right.  Heís a human being and he has his flaws but it doesnít keep him from doing his job. 
[17:30]
 Yeah.  Running this country.  And the PresidentÖ  And heís done a damn good job.  You know, he is the President of the United States but heís got a personal life.  Letís justÖ  Leave him alone.  And what about Chelsea?  Poor Chelsea.  She has suffered enough.  Could everyone just leave this issue alone?  And Chelsea go back to school andÖ  Can I make a plea to the media?  Yeah.  Please leave the Clintons alone in Marthaís Vineyard on vacation.  They have a lot of healing to do.  Yes.  Iím sure theyíll be going to church with Jesse Jackson again.  Yes.  And just trying to get the family back together. 
[18:00]
 Right.  And leave the poor guy alone.  I think heís been through enough.  There you go.  Monica Lewinsky I think is the cause of this whole thing.  Yeah, sheís no innocent broad.  You know, you have a guy in the White House trying to run the free world and sometimes  it gets rough and he gets a young girl coming in there and coming on to him.  Weíre all weak sometimes.  Heís just a man.  There you go.  Leave the guy alone.  Okay, very good.  If youíve got a comment on what we have to say, weíre finally piping in on the issue. 
[18:30]
 212-757-1027.  Letís take a couple calls here, all right?  Hi, Andy W.  Hey, Opie.  Anthony.  How are you doing, guys?  Whatís up, man?  I have to say, I got a comment on Flick Willie.  All right.  You guys are so right because as an ex-serviceman of a foreign war, the Gulf War, and a current  city police officer, I got to say one thing.  What?  Itís not just that he nailed this chick in the office, but itís his whole track record.  The guy is a draft, Dodger.  Oh, come on, man.  Dude, listen, give the guy a break already. 
[19:00]
 Kenneth Starr has been spending how much?  Hold a second.  Youíre doing 180 on me.  What do you guys think?  40 million dollars on this investigation.  Itís time to get it over with and get back to the business of running the country.  The guy is doing a great job.  Draft, Dodger.  I donít see why heís hung out the drive like a right-wing conspiracy that everyone  sees it.  Leave the guy alone.  Itís his personal life, for Godís sake.  Organizing wars on farm soil, blowing dooms, banging broads, and heís a tax chief with  white water.  I say we have him.  Come on.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah, but we need to understand.  Heís a good president. 
[19:30]
 Heís a good president.  We pay for the tolls or something.  We write them.  I say we make sure he has broads all the time so he can lead the country.  He obviously needs these broads to lead the country.  Thereís a reason why, sir.  It's an expolitium.  Sir, there is a reason why.  So letís all have a good night out.  Thank you, Kenneth.  Broad is for Clinton.  Oh, God.  Thatís all he says.  There you go.  Let me tell you, I was speaking on a whole platoon to Clinton.  All right, later.  Let me get rid of that guy.  He obviously doesnít agree with our point of view.  Damn.  Hi, N.E.W.  Well, listen, howís Clinton doing?  Are you still busting his balls or are you a gold pro now?  Oh, I donít understand what youíre talking about. 
[20:00]
 We have been behind the president as I think everybody should be in his time of need.  Oh, you guys are so fair.  Heís been doing a fantastic job and Iím sick of everyone bashing him.  He came clean.  Itís a personal issue between him and his wife.  And I think this investigation has gone on too long and cost too much money.  The damn right-wing conspiracy is what it is.  Heís been the president during the most prosperous time in this country.  You ought to have some respect.  We got to go now. 
[20:30]
 All right.  Take care.  Wow, itís amazing how many people have different opinions than what we just said on the radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Itís kind of shocking actually.  1027 W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, Aerosmith song for the president.  I'm wacky.  I just dedicated that to the president.  Thatís insane, Opie.  Iím a brilliant radio DJ.  Youíre like one of those wack zingerific DJs. 
[21:00]
 Dedicated big tenage to the president.  Ho, ho.  And then Iím going to follow it up with Fat Bottom Girls for Monica.  I'm so good.  Ho, ho.  I'm so good at this.  Oh, sorry.  Itís Opie and Anthony.  Hey, you got a chance to win tickets tomorrow morning with Dave Herman to the taping of  the VH1 storytellers featuring Sheryl Crowe.  Weíre doing that off and on for you.  Thatís happening Thursday night only on the Rock of New York, W.N.E.W.  And I mention that because weíre going to have the New York City premiere of Sheryl  Croweís latest song, Before the Hour is Up.  So keep listening, okay?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Itís Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy. 
[21:30]
 Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  Bill Clancy.  So keep listening, okay?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Is Bill Clinton going to do a storytellers?  Ho ho.  See that?  Ho ho.  That's a little segue joke about the President.  All right.  Weíre taking a lot of heat for supporting the President this afternoon.  I figured someone out here in the media had to support the President.  Not many people are doing it really.  Commander in Chief, we have to stick behind?  Yeah. 
[22:00]
 Of course.  Letís go to the phones here.  Hi, N.E.W.  You know, the President did lie to the American public.  What's a little lie between friends?  He didn't lie.  Between friends, he has a duty to be truthful and to set an example for the children of  this nation.  He was thinking of his family.  Wouldn't you think of your family in that circumstance?  I would think of the family.  Just because he's the President doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings about his family.  He was obviously protecting his family.  That's all that was about.  Come on.  We can see through this.  Come on. 
[22:30]
 And he didn't lie.  He didn't lie.  He was keeping a few details from people.  He said, ìI want you to listen to me.  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.î  Yeah, but what does sexual relations mean?  Thereís different meanings.  You notice he didn't use sexual relations in his comments last night.  Thereís different meanings to that.  He didn't feel that he was having a relationship with her.  And don't you know in Arkansas, ìEaten, ate, cheated.î  ìEaten, ate, cheated.î  So to him, you know, he never had sexual relations with her. 
[23:00]
 Why don't you just lighten up on the guy, the poor guy.  No, no, no.  Because I agree with the whole 40 million dollars has gone way too far.  But this out honestlyÖ  It has.  It has.  We could have solved that.  And if Penn Star would back off and leave the poor guy alone, we could spend the tax  money maybe on the homeless or building rehab centers for drug addicts.  That's exactly right.  But too, the situation has come about.  Or crack babies.  The situation has come about.  And he did make comments to the United States saying that he did not have sexual relations. 
[23:30]
 It took a lot of courage for him to get on TV last night and come clean like that.  And I think that shows that he is a noble, truthful and respectable man.  Thank you.  Thanks for your comments.  Man, unbelievable how people all see our point, you know.  A woman can't stand behind Bill Clinton like that.  Yeah, I mean the country runs itself.  So who cares if the President is getting a little action in the Oval Office.  What else does he have to do in there lately, right? 
[24:00]
 Exactly.  Two for Tuesday.  We got two from Pearl Jam next.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Pearl Jam.  Those guys coming to town in September for a few sold out shows.  Are we going to have tickets for Pearl Jam, boss?  We are?  Nice.  All right, cool.  Certainly.  So you got to keep listening to A&W for that.  And right around the corner we got the New York City premiere of the new Sheryl Crow  song.  All right.  Okay.  Well, I guess we got to go back to the phones because a lot of people are disagreeing with 
[24:30]
 the Bill and Monica thing.  Well, I have a few people on the Instant Feedback that actually agree with us.  Oh, nice.  That Clinton has come forward, told the truth, and that we should get on with the business  of running this country and not spend any more tax dollars and time on what amounts  to a witch hunt.  Of course it's a witch hunt.  This was invented by the Republicans, this whole mess.  Right from the start.  Right from the start.  Bill Clinton now has a big problem of dealing with personal issues, which should have remained 
[25:00]
 personal, yes.  And he's going to take some time vacationing with his wife and family and get things back  together.  And is he going to come back with a clear head?  Well, yeah, so to speak.  I didn't say nothing.  Why is everyone laughing?  So to speak.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, here for Tuesday with you two, a couple from Rattle  and Hum.

Has this ever, because I'm curious, because it happens to my wife Jennifer too,  Has this ever, because I'm curious, because it happens to my wife Jennifer too,  that when you start drying off, you know, you go to dry the undercarriage, let's say,  that when you start drying off, you know, you go to dry the undercarriage, let's say,  and it's like, woo, woo, what is that? 
[28:30]
 and it's like, woo, woo, what is that?  And what is it?  Well, we call it a wild hair in your ass.  Come on.  Come on.  Now, we can't be the only two people on the face of the earth that this happened to.  And like, as you're drying, you know, you kind of like pull the hair that was in your head  and is now like, you know, I guess in your crack.  Maybe your hair isn't long enough.  What happened to our radio show? 
[29:00]
 Opie, it's just something that happens, and I was wondering if it just happened to anybody else.  No, it hasn't, Si.  Or you.  No, because you shed.  Maybe your hair just isn't long enough.  What the hell is going on with you and your wife and hair falling out in your place?  Nothing.  As you wash your hair, you haven't like cleaned the drain out and there's some hair in there?  Of course, yeah.  I will, I'm just saying.  Sometimes it might not make it to the drain.  And it makes it to you, eh?  It just kind of, you know, wherever.  You got a hairy, eh? 
[29:30]
 No, not...  You got a very good brother-in-law, but you.  But you're the only one.  There's a bat cave, doesn't it, back there?  No!  You know how the Batmobile had to go through the bodies and stuff?  Is that what you're talking about?  I'm not talking about the hair on...  I knew it was a lost cause.  I try to get to the bottom of something.  You got to the bottom of it, alright.  And see if anybody else has experienced the wild hair.  It's, eh, looks like the bat cave. 
[30:00]
 I'm talking about...  You don't know what the entrance is.  Which is a good thing, actually.  Yeah, keep it camouflaged.  Alright, maybe I'm a nut.  What do I know?  Maybe someone has something on the phone to help us out.  Sorry.  Hi, N.E.W.  Okay, I'll be honest with you guys.  At first, I thought you guys sucked.  But then, when I heard that librarian goof, you know, with Anita Buschlicker, the road  rage, and especially, I like the Darth Volger, I'm starting to get turned on to you guys. 
[30:30]
 You're very Stern-esque, so to speak.  Well, I think anybody doing anything on the radio instead of just singing songs is obviously  going to get the comparison.  Well, I'm an original Die Hard fan, like I say, and at first I didn't care for you guys,  but then, like I say, you started to grow on me a bit more.  Would you like to hear Darth Volger today?  Yeah, that would be a solid.  Alright, man.  I'm a Star Wars fan.  Where are you calling from?  Babylon.  Right on, bro.  Thank you.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday. 
[31:00]
 Peter Gabriel, I have the touch from the Phenomenon CD.  What, the soundtrack?  I wish people could see that.  Well, what do I do?  I didn't do nothing wrong.  When you go to the mic and go 107, and it's not on, and you go, oh, hit the button, then  you go 107, 107.  What is Anthony saying?  He's announcing wrong stations and saying wrong things.  I don't know.  What I'm saying is that you didn't have your mic on.  How does...  Don't get on me.  Oh my God.  Mr. Jackass.  Alright, to the listeners out there, did I have my microphone on? 
[31:30]
 Did I come in right at the end of that song?  Did I say the correct call letters are the right radio station that I'm working at?  Alright, fine.  Unlike other people who just announced another station that I think is a country station  somewhere in Connecticut.  I didn't say anything.  Alright.  Alright, enough.  What did we learn today?  We learned absolutely nothing.  We did?  Yeah.  Well, we had our little opinion on the Clinton thing.  Yes.  And thanks for the support.  Yes.  And tomorrow is Clinton Free Wednesday? 
[32:00]
 Yes, let's do that.  Let's do a Clinton Free Wednesday tomorrow.  I think we can handle that.  We won't talk about Bill Clinton unless he does something tonight.  Yeah.  Maybe Hillary will kill him and we'll have to talk about him tonight.  Bring back Ronald Reagan.  We need another depression.  Who wrote that?  Earl?  Oh, Earl.  Come here.  Oh, here he is.  Mr. Liberal.  Earl.  What was wrong with Ronald Reagan?  He's a black guy.  The guy did a great job.  Ronald Reagan is not a black guy.  Oh, Earl is black and most black guys don't like Clinton, right? 
[32:30]
 No, they like Clinton.  Oh, they like him.  Okay.  Now, what's the problem with Reagan?  He's stupider than Dirk, you know.  What was wrong with Reagan?  Reagan was a power.  He kicked ass and nobody messed with him.  That's right.  That's right.  He was using some of that good Pentagon hardware our tax dollars paid for to bomb people.  Not take testimony of his swing.  At a remote location.  Reagan wouldn't have been found in the Oval Office with his pants down. 
[33:00]
 Reagan can't find his pants right now.  I did all my screwing back in the Hollywood days when I was in the movies.  I beat it down with bombs, though, once.  Well, that was the best time I ever had.  Reagan was a great president.  He was a great president.  What a great leader that guy was.  Oh, another depression.  What, Reagan gets a bad rap for the economy that happened after he got out of office? 
[33:30]
 With the Democratic Congress.  With the Democratic Congress?  That's right.  Oh, why do you think the economy is great now?  Bill Clinton and his magic wand behind his zipper?  I don't think so.  It's the Republican Congress.  Oh, and it's just the way the economy runs in waves.  Runs in waves.  Good, bad, doesn't matter who's in office.  I apologize.  What puppets in the White House that four-year block of time that the economy's doing good or bad?  Earl, don't apologize.  Challenge us.  Ronald Reagan brought back some respect to a country that had another hillbilly, Jimmy Carter, 
[34:00]
 who, remember, he got in trouble for having lust in his heart.  Remember that?  The Playboy interview?  Oh, my God.  I have had lust in my heart, duh.  The problem was no one wanted to do Carter or he would have been the same.  Yeah, he'd have been the same, but...  Like Clinton is.  I just couldn't find no one to sleep with me.  But him, that whole debacle with Iran and Reagan gets in, busts some butt, 
[34:30]
 makes some appropriate cuts where they belonged, and brought the country back.  There you go.  And you never heard about his ween.  That's right.  His ween wasn't brought up in eight years that he was in office,  either figuratively speaking or...  Our literal challenger.  What do you got to say about that, Earl?  I got my presidents mixed up.  I meant George Bush.  Now, George Bush was another great leader.  Come on.  What a great...  He got knocked by the Democrats so bad. 
[35:00]
 How the hell did he ever lose that election anyway?  See how the polls turned?  You know why?  Because he said, read my lips, no taxes.  See, he lied to the American people and they threw him out.  They didn't reelect him.  Bill Clinton, he got into office on a lie, twice.  All right, Earl, great.  Good work, Earl.  Good reading, Earl.  Thank you.  You helped out our show today.  Thank you.  Bring back Ronald Reagan.  This was our...  We know the depression.  This was our best break of the day. 
[35:30]
 Thank you.  I'm serious.  Whenever you want to...  Whenever you want to...  Whenever you want to report...  Whenever you want to participate in the Opie and Anthony show,  just feel free to come on in and bust in and jump on mics.  When did we turn into the Larry King show in here?  Right.  Crossfire.  Opie and Anthony in the crossfire.  And Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  All right.  James Carvel.  All right, we got to get out of here.  All right, man, we're done.  Yeah, Matt DeMote is on your radio next.  Thanks for checking us out.  Two for Tuesday continues.  What's your first two for, Matt?
