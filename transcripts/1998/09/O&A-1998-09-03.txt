 Soapy, it's Anthony.  Hey, where's your headphones?  We're ready to broadcast here.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  This is professional radio, the number one market in the entire world and you don't even  have headphones.  I just took off the computer.  We were in a meeting until 3.05.  Yeah, we've got to get out of those meetings a lot earlier.  I know.  We've got to entertain people.  We don't have time.  Or at least try to entertain people.  Take a whack at it.  Take a whack at it, yes.  Overnight ratings for the Opie and Anthony show, we gained 75 listeners yesterday.  How many did we kick off? 
[00:30]
 We lost 52, but we're on the positive side for the first time in a long, long time.  I'm feeling good.  Feeling good.  Thursday.  All right.  Okay.  Could someone get him headphones?  What's the matter?  I don't know.  Do I sound weird?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Shut up.  Yes, I can hear you.  All right.  No, don't show him those pictures.  Look at these old Opie pictures.  Look at you.  You look like a little kid.  I was a little kid.  That's 10 years ago when I was working in Buffalo.  Little ski bunnies.  Nice. 
[01:00]
 Let me see those pictures.  I haven't seen them in a while.  Pictures on the radio.  Yeah, this is great radio.  Yeah, there's me.  Yeah, spend your time looking at your pictures.  That's great.  This is when I used to get laid.  Did you bag any of those chicks?  Actually, yeah.  This one, all three of these.  All three of them?  Come on.  Opie was a real Casanova back in the old days.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you. 
[01:30]
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you. 
[02:00]
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a picture of you.  Unusual job.  Well, there's this one guy, his job, he makes music for porno movies.  That's easy.  That's very easy.  Just kind of lay down that jazzy guitar sound.  Maybe a sax in the background.  It's so cool because what he and his buddy do, they put porn magazines all over their apartment. 
[02:30]
 It inspires them.  And it inspires them and then they just jam and they come up with some cool music for pornos.  That's a good job.  Can you imagine having that job? That would be great.  That's a good one.  Also in Time Out magazine, there's a guy, his whole job is to hang out in luxury hotels and critique them.  That's a good job too.  He goes incognito and he checks out hotels and decides what they need to do to improve their service.  Another guy, all day long, he's a model spotter. 
[03:00]
 What the hell is that?  He looks at 500 different people a day, goes to like 10 night clubs a night just to find that next hot face.  All right.  That's his job.  That's a cool job to hang out in bars and look at hot women and stuff.  Sure.  Take their picture.  And then there's the punter for the Jets.  That's an unusual job.  If you ever thought about what a punter actually does, according to this article, he needs to know four plays. 
[03:30]
 The rest of the team has to memorize like 60 plays for the season.  The punter has four plays.  So while everyone else is practicing and stuff, the guy just kicks the ball all day long.  That's his job.  And if you think about it, it's got to get boring after a while.  It's almost like he's not even playing football.  No.  Like he's thrown in there like the halftime attraction.  Pretty much.  And then it goes on.  There's jobs that you don't want.  Like there's a guy who's an understudy for the musical Cats, but he never really gets to go on stage. 
[04:00]
 He gets to go on stage maybe once a week.  Sometimes he gets sick.  But then there's this guy, look at this, his job, he's a body waxer.  He takes hair.  He removes hair from like guys and stuff.  And he talks about how he takes hair out from their scrotum and stuff.  But that's what he does for a living.  Can you imagine?  You got to remove hair from guys.  That's your job.  And then it goes on.  There's another one.  Crime scene photographer. 
[04:30]
 That sounds pretty cool.  It is pretty cool.  But this guy says why it's not cool.  And I don't want to get into it because it involves kids.  But his job is to take pictures of crime scenes, which is an unusual job.  Now I mention all these because I'm thinking, Time Out magazine did a great job on that article and stuff.  But I think we could find more unusual jobs out there.  Unusual.  Yes.  All right.  And maybe we could give Pearl Jam tickets away to this. 
[05:00]
 We once again will be the sole judges as to who has the most unusual job.  And you've got to prove it too.  Because you can make up something, but somehow you're going to have to prove it to win the Pearl Jam tickets.  I think there should be two categories today.  Worst job, the worst job in the New York area, and we'll crown a champion, and the most unusual job in the New York area.  Okay.  All right.  So if you think you're worthy enough to get in on that contest, give us a call.  212-757-1027. 
[05:30]
 I know the phones are going to ring like crazy, so if you have a hard time getting through, please just keep trying.  Or maybe you could fax us the info and we'll call you back.  212-957-WNEW.  Or maybe you could even use the Instant Feedback if you're hooked up online right now.  Mew.com.  Just click on our picture.  Yeah.  It's self-explanatory, right?  Yeah, you get there.  All right, cool.  On the way, a song we haven't played in a while, Golden Earring and Harvey Danger, by request.  Next.  Dave Matthews Band, what would you say on the Rock of New York?  1027-WNEW. 
[06:00]
 You're hanging with OP and Anthony.  We got more tickets to see Pearl Jam today.  We've been doing it all week long.  And today we're looking for two categories.  We're looking for the most unusual job in the New York area, and we're looking for the worst job in the New York area.  And the winner of both categories will win a pair of tickets to see Pearl Jam.  And it's going to get really hard to get a hold of us because the phones are going crazy because everyone thinks their job is the worst.  So I would suggest you just keep calling until you get through to us, 212-757-1027. 
[06:30]
 Or easier ways you can fax us with the info and we'll call you back, 212-957-WNEW.  Or you can do the instant feedback by clicking on our pictures through the WNEW website.  Yes.  And we'll get that instantly.  So let's go to the phones and see what we can get here.  Hi, NEW.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  What's your job?  We set headstones in cemeteries and we open mausoleum-put bodies in.  Pretty cool, man.  You put the bodies in the mausoleums.  There you go.  Do you smoke a lot of dope before you do that? 
[07:00]
 I don't know, man. Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  So what's the strangest thing you've seen at your line of work?  Well, we were in a mausoleum once and the body came falling out.  A body fell out?  Yeah, because there ain't caskets, but the box opened and it came right out.  It was pretty nasty.  So what'd you do?  Ran.  It stinks, man.  Yeah, really?  That'll freak you out.  It stinks.  All right, I guess we've got to start somewhere, Rob and Pat.  Yeah, what'd you say?  You guys are in the running.  All right, cool, B. 
[07:30]
 All right, man.  Thanks.  I do believe we could beat that.  Yeah.  We've got a guy here, Mike B., on the Instant Feedback.  My stinking job is to impregnate cows.  This involves sticking my arm up to my shoulder, you know where,  and inserting the bull sperm.  Come on.  And call them Mike Stinky Fist B.  Do we have his phone number?  Yeah.  All right, we've got to talk to Mike B.  That's going to be a tough job to beat if that's actually true.  And Chad from Jersey.  Yeah?  I've heard of this job before.  The worst job I had was cleaning out the private booths at the Peep Show 
[08:00]
 in Times Square by the splooge mob guy.  Chad.  Is that an actual job or is that just a...  I think that's a rumor job.  Like an urban legend job?  Yeah, I don't think anybody really had that job.  All right, if you do have an unusual job and you win the Pearl Jam tickets,  you've got to prove that you actually do this job.  You can't try to pull a fast one on us, all right?  But we've got to try to get ahold of Mike, the cow guy.  He sticks his arm up there. 
[08:30]
 All right, and we've also got to talk about the serial killer in a little while.  Oh yeah, that's a nice guy.  I broke out my serial killer song too for today.  I like it.  It's a special occasion.  As a matter of fact, we'll play that next time we're hanging, right?  Kind of a country twang to it, huh?  Yeah, I like it though.  It's kind of cool.  On the way also, we've got the latest from Sheryl Crow and David Bowie.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York with the latest from Sheryl Crow.  That's my favorite mistake off her CD, The Globe Sessions.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we're trying to give away tickets to see the sold-out Pearl Jam show. 
[09:00]
 And we're looking for the worst job in the New York area or the most unusual job.  Right, and both winners of those categories will win tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Let's go to the phones.  Jennifer, what's your job?  I work for a mortician as a beautician and a manicurist.  A mortician beautician.  Yeah.  So you make them look pretty for the funeral?  Well, I make their fingernails look pretty.  Oh, nice and shade of blue?  Yes.  You've got to hold a dead person's hand and paint their fingernails. 
[09:30]
 Yes, but you know, I didn't get any key points.  What is...  But I didn't get any repeat customers either.  That old gag.  That old gag.  What did it feel like?  It was kind of weird.  It felt like a rubber hand, like a cold rubber hand.  Ah, come on.  And you do this on a regular basis?  I used to, yeah.  Currently I'm working for an accountant.  Oh, that's more exciting.  Yes, it's real.  Barely.  Yeah.  To step down, though, in personality. 
[10:00]
 Uh-oh.  Did you have to do their hair?  Yes, and when I first went, my mom would poke them in the face and say,  Look, look, they won't hurt you.  Touch them.  Oh, my God.  Are they naked when you do it?  No, they're all dressed, and then they're in their little casket with their pink chiffon on  and, you know, satin blanket on them and all that.  Have you guys ever taken a peek?  No, but you know, I was tempted to jump in an empty casket and take a picture  and send it to a person as a joke, but I didn't.  You are dark, man. 
[10:30]
 Wow.  All right, Jennifer, hold on the line.  I do believe you're in the lead.  Really?  Yes, hold on.  All right.  If you think you could beat Jennifer with an unusual job or the worst job in the New  York area, give us a call and we'll get to you next, okay?  He's a heebie-jeebie.  Without a doubt.  Reminds me of a serial killer guy.  I was reading about the serial killer in the papers today, and for the first time in a  very long time, I started dry heaving up there in Poughkeepsie.  Yes.  They found a load of bodies buried in this guy's yard and house and the basement. 
[11:00]
 Well, the sickest part of the story, there was just an unbelievable odor coming from  this house and he was living with his parents and his younger sister and no one questioned  the smell coming from the walls of this house.  Can you imagine?  Could you imagine?  It's only a few bodies.  I'm asking if it stinks.  At one time in all of our lives, we've had that pig sty that kind of smelled a little  bit, but can you imagine the smell that came out of this house?  Like dead animal.  That's what it smells like.  You ever have that? 
[11:30]
 I'm getting the energy.  Raccoon or something die in the chimney?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or that mouse that died in the wall?  Yeah.  That's like a mouse.  Picture a few people.  They don't even know how many they're going to pull out of this house.  They're up to eight, right?  Yeah.  Great.  Only in New York.  Home of the serial killers.  What is this?  Doria Four now?  We've got some good serial killers in New York.  You ought to be proud.  Well, I brought in the serial killer song today.  We only play it on special occasions.  We don't do it on any special occasions.  We just play it.  We're not doing it on any special occasions.  We just play it on special occasions.  We're not doing it on any special occasions. 
[12:00]
 I guess today would be a great day to play the serial killer song, huh?  And I got to say, it's nice to see somebody in the African American community getting  involved in serial killing.  I've often said that it's usually the white guys that are the kooks that go around killing  these prostitutes and serial killers.  It's kind of...  The black guys, usually the gang bangers.  Yeah.  They have a reason, maybe.  Yeah.  Whatever it is, pop a cap in your ass or whatever.  Yeah, you're stereotyping, but that's okay. 
[12:30]
 Well, yeah, of course I am because it's the white guys that are the nuts sitting home.  Mother, mother, she's a dirty whore.  I have to kill her.  She's dirty.  But it's, you know, usually you don't see the black guys serial killing.  No, not at all.  So it's good.  It gives me a feeling maybe we're finally getting unified here as people.  We're crossing boundaries, Opie.  Very nice.  Are you ready for the serial killer song?  I think it's going to be a good one.  I think it's going to be a good one.  I think it's going to be a good one.  I think it's going to be a good one.  I think it's going to be a good one.  Let's hear it.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. 
[13:00]
 You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  And once again today we got tickets to see the Sold Out Pearl Jam show.  Came up with an interesting little biddy today to win the tickets.  We're looking for two categories.  We're looking for the worst job in New York and we're looking for the most unusual job  in New York.  What was your worst?  My worst?  I was a dishwasher.  That was it, huh?  Well, that's it.  I was a dishwasher at...  Is this in between caddying when you were...  Yeah, I had some hard working caddying.  I had some unusual jobs but my worst job was at... 
[13:30]
 Everyone washed dishes at the Wall-Wippen Mall in Huntington at the A&S.  I washed dishes in the restaurant.  All right.  You think that's that?  What did you do?  I was working for Apollo Air Conditioning.  They sent me on a job at a sewage treatment plant.  I had to hang over a vat of excrement to hang a hood for a ventilation duct.  Oh my God.  I am not kidding.  It was the most disgusting thing I ever had to do. 
[14:00]
 I stunk like that for a week straight.  Lovely.  That was the worst job.  Very good.  Better than your dish washing.  What's the matter?  Dish pan hands?  No, I could get into it but it's going to take 20 minutes.  We've got like 10 people with unusual jobs on the phone lines.  I'll talk about it in a little while though.  There's a good story involved.  I guess the person that's in the lead is the mortician beautician.  Yes.  The girl that polishes the fingernails of bodies.  Puts nail polish on the dead bodies.  Does it matter when you're going to be putting the ground that your nails look nice? 
[14:30]
 She does their hair with her mom.  If you think you could beat that job, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Hi, what's up?  What's your job?  I own a grooming and waxing service for strippers.  What do you mean for strippers?  Well, actually I'd service anyone but strippers are the majority of my clientele.  And you wax them?  You give them those bikini waxers?  It started as a joke.  I was at a strip bar with my friends one night and we were talking about it.  I was like, I should come up with this for a business and I ran up by a couple of strippers 
[15:00]
 and they said it was a great idea.  He makes up a job so he can see some of my Hitler mustaches.  But the thing is, it took off.  I got all these people calling me.  I had to come up with a business card and stuff.  What does your business card say?  It says, Bill's grooming and waxing service and my slogan is no muff too tough.  And it says for an appointment call me and I got my number and I passed them out at strip bars.  How are the girls wearing it these days? 
[15:30]
 I don't like the landing strip.  I don't like that look.  I like to touch it up with a nice triangle.  Nice, trim little triangle.  The natural look but kept in control.  Don't let Anthony fool you.  I like the 70's earth mama muck.  Who are you kidding?  I prefer the natural shape so it's not like the Hitler mustache or the landing strip but kept in control.  Not like an overgrown yard. 
[16:00]
 Don't listen to that crap.  Anthony likes his ladies to look like they're making Jiffy Pop popcorn in their panties.  Come on.  You were the one that dated the Wookie.  Alright, I don't want to get into that today.  Hope he likes girls that look like they have Don King's head in the leg lock.  73rd mama muck for Anthony.  Listen, I think you're in the running for the Pearl Jam tickets.  Hold on the line.  This is getting interesting now.  We've got a guy that grooms strippers down below and we have the mortician beautician. 
[16:30]
 I think we've got to get the listeners voting too.  But don't use the phone lines because people are trying to get through with their unusual jobs.  But if you want to fax us a vote who you think has the most unusual job, that's cool.  212-957-WNEW or you can do the instant feedback on the internet.  WNEW.com  Alright, talking heads, Pearl Jam, Goo Goo Dolls, all on the way if you stay where you are.  Instant feedback coming in from Steve on the west side.  Hope he says, let me get this straight.  Mr. No Muff Too Tough has his head in a stripper's lap all day and his job sucks? 
[17:00]
 No, no, it's two categories we're working on here.  The worst job and the most unusual job.  And I guess that would qualify as most unusual.  Yeah, so I think in the lead for most unusual job is the stripper trimmer.  And for the worst job I would have to go with mortician beautician.  If you could be either one of those, give us a call.  212-757-1027  Pretty much the most requested song on the radio these days.  Here's the Goo Goo Dolls on the Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW. 
[17:30]
 Can't wait to hear that song next week when Pearl Jam comes to town.  Live, it's Hopey, it's Anthony.  And we've got tickets to see Pearl Jam once again today.  We've been giving away all week long trying to have some fun with the ticket giveaways.  And today we've come up with a little interesting little contest.  We're looking for the most unusual job in the New York area and the worst job in the New York area.  It's looking pretty good for the mortician beautician because from the instant feedbacks I'm getting. 
[18:00]
 Dana in New York says I vote for the mortician beautician.  What a job. I can't imagine having to beautify dead bodies every day.  How depressing.  Yes, I got a fact here from Peaches. I vote for the sick girl who polishes dead people's fingernails.  And Larry in Woodbridge.  I say let the mortician...  It's not a nice word to call her.  She's a bitch.  I say let the mortician have the tickets.  There's no way she never took a peek at a stiff, stiff one. 
[18:30]
 Probably had a quick feel too.  Larry, you're sick, man.  I love it, actually.  So the mortician beautician is leading in the worst job in the New York area.  And the most unusual job is the guy that trims strippers' private areas.  So if you could beat either one of those categories for the Pearl Jam tickets, we need for you to get a hold of us.  212-757-1027.  N.E.W., what's your job? 
[19:00]
 I work in a booth down in Boardwalk.  What do you do?  And they shoot me with paintball.  That's a horrible job.  Why, what's wrong with that?  It pays my bills, don't it?  And what's the name of the job?  It's called Shoot Ed.  Shoot Ed?  My name is Ed.  I figured that out.  You haven't taken too many headshots, have you?  Nah, man. I wear a shield over my face.  Yeah, they hurt. 
[19:30]
 Well, I get like a percentage of the take.  Well, just shoot me.  Yeah, they get a prize, you know, a puppy dog or something.  Well, I wear a cup.  Mostly the most vulnerable places like my home.  Just like Monica. 
[20:00]
 Alright, man. Shoot Ed.  You are definitely a contention.  Definitely. That's a weird job.  Alright, shoot Ed.  Now, is that the worst job in the New York area or the most unusual job in the New York area?  I'd say unusual. You could think of worse.  Go with unusual?  Yeah, I'd put him in the unusual category.  You think he's leading that category? Is that job more unusual than the stripper trimmer?  Yeah. 
[20:30]
 There are beauty shop people that wax girls.  I don't know many people that are shoot Ed.  Obviously, if you're listening to the show and you've got an opinion on any of this, you can fax us with your votes or give us a little instant feedback.  Alright, we'll put shoot Ed in the lead for most unusual job in the New York area.  And worst job in the New York area still goes to the beautician.  I've got a plain old bit here.  I'll flat out say it's an old bit.  We've got to set the record straight. 
[21:00]
 For the last couple of weeks, you guys email us all the time and you're starting to contribute to the show and stuff.  We really appreciate that. It's helping us out.  But a bunch of people have faxed us the words to a song called Hey Masturbator.  Oh, right.  I know if you're at work and you collect email and stuff and you pass around your office or those wacky faxes that come in,  you've probably seen a song that's the words to Hey Masturbator.  And a lot of people have given credit to the song to Adam Sandler.  I don't know where that began, but it's not true. 
[21:30]
 And this bit was played literally all over the country.  Matter of fact, a bunch of radio stations right here in New York before me and Anthony came to town were playing this song and making believe they came up with it.  I still have the original transcript in my bag.  We can prove it.  The song is off our CD, Opie and Anthony's Demanded World.  And I just want to set the record straight.  I know we're all sick of the Macarena tune and stuff,  but it's really driving me nuts that people continue to send us this email and the faxes and claiming that Adam Sandler did it or another radio station did it. 
[22:00]
 No, it's copyrighted. It's on our CD.  And I just want to play it here.  All right.  Fun little ditty. Make up your own dance to it, Opie.  I have a dance that I usually do to this one.  Yeah?  I don't think I want to see that.  I like the Macarena, but only different.  But here it is off our CD that you can't buy in New York because our record company sucks.  Maybe you can call a friend in another state to pick up the CD for you because it's selling everywhere else but New York.  Here's Hey, Masturbator on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[22:30]
 Anyone else hear the stones in that song?  Just a little bit.  Little bit. Like mid-80s feel.  Kind of, huh?  Tragically hip and poets on the rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony still looking for the worst and most unusual thing in the world.  And most unusual job in the New York area.  Whoever wins each category will win a pair of tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Not bad.  Got a fax here from Brian. It reads,  This may not sound like the worst job, but believe me, it sucks.  I was the ball pit lifeguard for a cheap Discovery Zone ripoff called Whirly Gigs. 
[23:00]
 The ball pit.  You know when the kids go in there and it's just a ton of balls and they drool and whiz and crap all over those little balls and you send your kids in there.  Yeah, and this guy had to be the lifeguard in the middle of that thing.  He goes,  I'd be stuck in the ball pit with little kids coming up to me and hitting me in the face with plastic fluorescent colored balls and jumping and hitting me for hours at a time.  Man, it sucks.  The worst part is,  Hasidic Jewish families used to come in all the time and all they would speak is Hebrew, so I couldn't even understand what the hell they were saying.  They would just say,  Oh, I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing. 
[23:30]
 I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing. 
[24:00]
 I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to do the same thing.  Yeah, North Dean Street. 
[24:30]
 I was there and tried to trade that guy down two flights of stairs.  Damn, they broke my back on that one.  Did you get together for company picnics and stuff?  Yeah, me and my boys, we all hang together.  What is it like when you barbecue ribs?  Yeah, that's, you know...  Hey, doesn't this look like Charlie?  Yeah, yeah, right? Yeah, I hear you.  Oh my God.  Yeah, you know, we're out trolling for 180-pound bodies in the Hudson River with NYPD and stuff.  It's kind of cool.  It's an adventure.  It's an adventure.  Plus, you know, the paper goes up. 
[25:00]
 We never know what you're going to get.  It could be an OD in Rutherford.  It could be a car crash on 9W.  You never know until you get there.  You can take home your own Halloween ornaments.  Luicide, you name it, I get it.  Me and my boys, yeah.  Pick up a body and leave them in your yard for Halloween.  Yeah, me and my boys Sally, Billy Waxman, and Drew.  Yeah, we're out there.  All right, hold on the line. I do believe you're in the running.  All right, Jeff.  You know, we need to take a vote here.  I think the listeners need to help us out too. 
[25:30]
 You could send in your votes.  I knew the worst job would entail dead people.  Now, is that the worst job or the most unusual?  That's got to be the worst job, right?  But he enjoys it so much.  I know, that's what is tricking us a little bit here.  Then it's got to be the unusual category.  The worst job's got to be a guy that's just like,  No, no, no, no, no.  You know, I hate my job.  You got to sit around as a group of people and think.  That's like the worst job.  All right, is it the worst job to the person that's doing it  or the worst job to everybody looking at the job?  Just pretty much everyone looking in. 
[26:00]
 That's got to be the worst job.  Because I was under the impression the worst job  would be a guy that goes to work every day  and it's like, Oh man, I got to shovel, you know, horse manure or something.  Yeah, well, but we all need our jobs.  I don't.  No, I don't either.  I worked for a living.  This doesn't work.  I worked for a living at some point, Opie.  I love my job.  I count my blessings.  So what category should we put this guy in?  It's got to be unusual, I would think.  Unusual? 
[26:30]
 You're saying worse?  All right, so in the worst job category,  it's still the mortician beautician.  You got to beat that.  A lady who paints dead people's fingernails  and stuff before the funerals and does their hair.  She didn't seem to mind that either.  That's what I'm saying.  She loved that job when we talked to her.  This is very difficult.  Now you're seeing my point here.  Okay.  So it's a group of us  looking in.  We feel that's a bad job. 
[27:00]
 Yes, of course.  Because the mortician beautician, she was laughing and  thinks it was funny that her and her mom  poked the dead people and say, Look, they won't hurt you.  They enjoy that job.  So now we've got to vote.  For the worst job, we've got mortician beautician  or the guy who picks up dead bodies  all over the New York area.  That's a very close race happening there.  And then most unusual job in the lead  is shoot Ed.  A guy named Ed who hangs out on the boardwalk  and you shoot paintballs at him and try to win  fuzzy, cute little animals. 
[27:30]
 Shoot Ed! Shoot Ed! I'm Ed!  He beat out the stripper tremor so far.  The guy who grooms strippers.  So if you think you have  a job that will top either one of those,  you've got to give us a call.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Phones are ringing like crazy.  I think it's going to get even more unusual  as the afternoon gets us going here.  Plus a ton of people are asking for  the serial killer song again.  We will definitely play that in the 5 o'clock hour  because a lot of people are getting in their cars  for the long ride home. So we'll do that. 
[28:00]
 Also on the way, oh man, look at all this great stuff.  Petty, STP,  and Days of the Noon X.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York  with Tom Petty, it's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, the voting heating up here  with the people emailing us in  some of their opinions.  Bag'em and tag'em guy.  Hey, I changed my vote.  He definitely effing wins.  Got to be the sickest job.  Lisa also says the worst job.  Definitely the dude who picks up the dead bodies.  Not only does he pick up the dead bodies, 
[28:30]
 he picks them up from all different situations.  Like an old person dying in their house.  No, he goes to murder scenes.  He has to find the drowning victim.  What a job.  What a job.  Well, the voting getting furious.  Definitely the guy that picks up  the stiffs.  Wow, the voting changed.  I guess he's in the lead now over the  mortician beautician for worst job  in the New York area for the Pearl Jam tickets.  That lady's still my vote.  Where she actually has to paint the fingernails 
[29:00]
 of the dead people and do their hair and stuff  before the funerals.  It's very morbid, but she laughs through the whole thing  and thinks it's a cool job.  And then in the most unusual category,  it's still shoot Ed.  Shoot Ed. I'm pulling for shoot Ed.  I'm pulling for shoot Ed.  So is the crown.  They love him.  I vote for shoot Ed.  Give it to shoot Ed.  He hangs out on a boardwalk and  he sits there and people shoot him with  paintballs to win those fuzzy 
[29:30]
 little stupid animals from  those animals are a waste of time.  And I love it. It's like they have the big  animals hanging there.  All I got to do is throw the ball and knock down  all three milk bottles.  Yeah. All right.  I got it. Hey, why are you giving me that little  one inch tall little dragon?  What about the big one? Oh, no,  you got to do that 60 times and then  you could trade 60 of those little  keychain size one for the big one  or for the medium one. Yeah. Yeah. What a rip.  Don't buy the myth though. 
[30:00]
 What I mean by that, you know, when you  do win the huge orange giraffe  for your girlfriend is like, you look cool  at the carnival because everyone sees the big  large giraffes, you know, and everyone's trying  to win them. Yeah. But then when the carnival's over  and you go home, you're like, what the hell  am I going to do with a big huge orange  giraffe? It's not cool anymore.  Are you going to the Greenlawn  Fireman's Fair tonight?  Are we going to go there? Oh, well, come  on. It is the premiere event of Greenlawn.  You should know you went to Harbour Field.  I haven't been to the Fireman's 
[30:30]
 Fair. You got to get your beer mug. That's every  glass I own in my house is from the  Fireman's Fair. Is it really? You got to go.  Well, I got the jet glasses too from the gas  station. You could win me something.  Is this our first live appearance  at the Greenlawn  Fireman's Fair? It's getting  bad, isn't it? It sure is.  All right. So Shoot Ed is in the lead for the most  unusual job. I like the guy though. He goes,  my job is Shoot Ed.  Shoot Ed. Amen.  Really? Really? Thank you, dude. 
[31:00]
 Let's go to the phones. What's your job?  I'm a U.S. Customs Inspector.  What's so bad about that?  Sometimes when we get the people off the planes,  we got to take them to the hospital and go  through, once we see they have drugs in their stomach,  we got to go through after they  poop in the old pot,  we got to go through it to make sure it's all out, all the drugs  are out. You have to go through  people's poop to make sure they didn't smuggle  drugs into the country? Once we know it's  there, we got to go through it to make sure we got it all.  We got to watch them go so they don't flush you down the toilet.  Oh my God. 
[31:30]
 So you got to  go through their poop?  Yeah, I guess you call it a sh** job sometimes.  I would say that.  You couldn't find  thick enough gloves for me to use.  I would definitely say you're in  contention.  All right. Hold on the line.  Wow, now we got to add that to the voting.  Guy who goes through people's poop for drugs.  Do we have time for one more real faster?  I mean, our phones are just lit.  Hey Rich.  Yeah, how are you doing? 
[32:00]
 Pretty good. What's your job?  I'm a nurse practitioner for a plastic surgeon in Great Neck.  And I'm responsible  when they do the liposuction  on the patients to weigh  the lipids and lusids after they remove it.  So after they suck out  the fat, I have to put it out on the counter.  And the milky yellow, which is  the lipid fat, I have to weigh that.  And then I have to weigh the  much darker yellow, so the lucid fat.  I just got the heebie-jeebie.  Well, not only does it disgust and touch it,  but the odor is 
[32:30]
 beyond belief.  And here's the real problem.  I don't know how to say it. If you get a real fat woman,  you have so much fat,  it's got to be weighed on a separate scale.  The record we had was  14 pounds of lipids and  7 pounds of lusids.  And it was so much, I had to stand on a  regular scale, weigh myself,  and take this blob up,  and the odor is ridiculous.  That's only half of it.  Then when they come back like 6 weeks later, 
[33:00]
 I'm in charge of massaging the area  in which the fat has been  taken out of.  Now I want to make a claim. I've listened to all the other people,  I think I could take the title in both categories.  I think you can, actually.  Alright, so your job is  you measure the fat  after people get the fat sucked out of them.  I have to separate the fat.  Separate it, measure it, weigh it.  I don't have to smell it, but unfortunately I do.  And then you've got to massage the area  when these people come back into the doctor's office.  Well, 6 weeks later they'll come back, 
[33:30]
 and I have to massage it to flatten out the area  because, not to get too gross,  but when you take a heavy concentration of fat,  it leaves like a hole.  Would you loofer my stretch marks?  Exactly.  You are definitely in the running.  Hold on the line.  Okay, thanks.  We definitely need the listeners to help us out  because these jobs are getting really out there.  I'm feeling a bit queasy.  If you want to vote on any of these jobs  to help us out with the voting, please do it.  Through the instant feedback would be the best way, 
[34:00]
 or you can fax us at 212-957-WNEW.  Coming back with Eve 6 and Queen next.  Foot checking in, he says  worst job, hands down,  dead body guy.  Really? A lot of people changing their votes  for the fat suck guy.  We're getting a ton of votes in the last minute here  if you're just tuning in a guy who weighs,  separates, and smells fat after  liposuction.  The lipo guy story made me heave.  Yeah, it was pretty gross.  I don't think we're done yet though.  I think there's a few more aces in the hole. 
[34:30]
 Phone lines 212-757-1027  if you got the worst job in the New York area  or the most unusual job  in the New York area.  Both winners will win a pair of tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Here's Queen on the Rock of New York  1027-WNEW  1027-WNEW  The Rock of New York with the wallflowers  heroes. It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, we haven't done a traffic  report in a month or so.  Anthony, traffic report for today.  If you're heading outbound  on all the 
[35:00]
 outbound crossings,  you're probably in traffic right now.  Thank you. Traffic sponsored by  nobody. We still don't have a sponsor for our  traffic. No. I don't understand it because I  think our traffic is more accurate than anyone  else's. Oh, and this just in too. If you're headed  eastbound on the LIE  the US Open.  It's probably not going very fast right now.  That's a good guess.  Well, the US Open is screwing everyone up. When is  that over? I don't know. I don't know about  anyone else, but it's put another 30 minutes onto  my commute home. And the GWB. 
[35:30]
 Yeah. That's a safe bet for me to just  say it's probably not moving  well right now. I don't have any  information in front of me. No TV.  No papers. No  I fact that  No helicopters in the sky. No, but I could  I could pretty much say if you're on the  GWB right now, you're  probably not going very fast.  Thank you. We should do traffic  where we throw darts at a dartboard.  And I guarantee we'll be just as accurate  as everyone else. I don't doubt that.  Alright, but there you go. The traffic. 
[36:00]
 Well, people  voting OP. Voting like crazy.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we got some Pearl Jam tickets  today. We're looking for the worst job in the New York  area and the most unusual job  in the New York area. Now, let  me help you out here. Okay, most unusual  job so far goes to shoot Ed.  Shoot Ed. A guy that gets shot by  paintballs all day long for stupid  fuzzy little prizes if you hit him enough  times. He's like the dopey favorite  with our voters here. Yeah,  they like him. But worst job,  I guess the mortician beautician has 
[36:30]
 been knocked out of the top spot, huh?  It looks it. Pushed down to third, I think.  Third. Under the guy that collects  the dead bodies.  He's getting a lot of votes. You're telling  me he's now in second place? Well,  I gotta tell you, a lot of people  now, Lipoman. Yeah.  The guy that has to  separate and weigh liposuction  fat and then  massage the legs or arms  or wherever they suck the fat out of  these people. Larry  in Woodbridge. I have to 
[37:00]
 change my vote. Okay. See, just when you think  you know who has the worst job,  we put another person on the phone and it  gets even worse. I think the guy  that deals with the fat ladies  disposed of body juices  absolutely has the worst job. And he brings  up a good point. Even he sounded  disgusted by it. When he was describing  his job. Yes. Absolutely. He has to  smell the fat too, which is like a little  perk. You know how we all have perks in our  jobs? His perk is he gets to smell  the fat too. Yeah. That's like a freebie.  And what about the drug 
[37:30]
 smuggling poop guy? He has to go through the  drug smuggler's poop to make sure they got all the drugs  that they've been smuggling into the country.  Well, Jeff from Jersey brought up a good  point. When I said I couldn't  they don't have gloves  thick enough for me to go through  human X. People who poop for drugs. Yeah.  He says, I wonder if the  custom agent said, hey gloves,  what a great idea.  Very nice. Anything else on the  instant feedback? Yeah, actually  we got a letter from the  district attorney's office. 
[38:00]
 Those guys hate us.  The DA's office. Yeah.  I won't use his name. I'll be nice  because maybe he's not supposed to be typing  on company time. Okay.  But, Opien Anthony, I finally figured it out.  Listening to your show is like when people  pass a bad car accident. You don't want to look  but you always end up looking anyway. Isn't that the truth?  Thank you. You didn't want to look at that  dead dog on the way to work. No, that  really bummed me out. And I was  glad that I didn't even know it was a dead dog  because I didn't look. That was really sad  actually. But go ahead. With you guys, 
[38:30]
 you know you really don't want to listen but you do  anyway. By the way, how many people have commented  that Opie looks like Gary Sandi from the old  WKRP and Cincinnati show?  I do not.  I don't think so. You look like Venus.  Oh yeah, I look like Venus.  Yeah. What did they call him?  He was like the Venus flytrap?  Flytrap, yeah. You look like Venus  flytrap. Our pictures were in the daily news yesterday  and I guess I don't look like him.  Are you going to help me out on this one or no?  He also writes, I don't hate you  anymore, just strongly dislike you. 
[39:00]
 That's okay. That's as regards.  This is just coming in from Jumbo. I used to work  in a private doctor's office uptown  cleaning up after the doctor had given  patients enemas.  There's a cozy job.  Dear Opie and Anthony, I love your show.  I am the publisher of  Big Butt Magazine  and also their top model.  Yes, I pose nude and lude.  Love Mindy.  Rick, get Mindy in the  studio tomorrow. I want to check out her big  old butt. 
[39:30]
 I've seen that magazine, Big Butt Magazine.  Really? It's disgusting.  But if she wants to come down and pose, we can  do something with that I guess.  So whatever you're into. Some people are into  that. Also, the boss  just came down the hall with some more tickets to the Sea Pearl Jam  because he likes the audience  participation today. So many people are  chiming in with their votes and helping us out  with the show today.  We're going to give a couple pairs away just through the phone lines  as well.  Because I know there's a lot of people out there that don't have  an unusual job or 
[40:00]
 the worst job.  We'll do that in a little while so keep  listening to the show.  But right now, really fast, we've got to play the serial killer  song. A lot of people are requesting it.  They found another serial killer up there in  Poughkeepsie.  Anthony made a really good point earlier in the show.  I would like you to reiterate that point, Anthony.  Well, Opi, you don't usually  see black serial killers.  It's the truth.  It just is. Usually serial killers  are crazy white guys.  Because, you know, 
[40:30]
 most black guys do the cool  crimes, you know?  Well, you know,  the crimes that might have some  sort of reason to them.  I don't know. In a demanded way, yeah.  I'm not saying it's right. I'm just saying  there's some kind of reason to it.  Maybe. And the white guys are always  the serial killers. The white guys, oh, we got  Joel Rifkin. We had him.  But now, you know,  it gives me hope  for our civilization  that maybe we are getting a little 
[41:00]
 more like each other  and together to see a black serial killer.  Jesus. All right.  Well, they did have the guy down there in Atlanta.  But he claims that  he wasn't the guy. That's right.  You never know.  This guy, I mean, had the bodies right in his house.  But I had to go through the O.P. and Anthony  archives and think in-house.  We only break out the serial killer  song if we, you know,  there's a new one that was caught.  And this song is about  the most famous one, obviously, Jeffrey Dahmer. 
[41:30]
 But I think  it can relate to this situation.  Put on your boots and hat and line dance to this one.  Yeah, it has a little country feel to it.  Check it out on the O.P. and Anthony show.  The serial killer song.  Right on, man.  1027WNEW,  the rock of New York, our buddy Johnny Lang.  His latest, Still Raining.  That is cool. Yeah.  I like that song a lot. We got to get Johnny Lang back  into the studio. He played in the imaginary  ballroom and he was absolutely  great. He did some really good radio for us, too. 
[42:00]
 Yeah, he's a fun guy. We just were  hanging like old pals in here.  So, Johnny Lang, Still Raining.  Bravo. It's O.P. It's Anthony.  Still looking for the worst job  and the most unusual job.  It's getting very interesting here. We got the Pearl Jam  tickets up for grabs. Most unusual  job, and  you got to get your job in  the next 15 or 20 minutes because we got to stop  and pick some winners. But  in the lead for most unusual job still  is Shoot Ed. Shoot Ed!  Guy named Ed who likes to get, well, 
[42:30]
 he gets shot by paintballs.  Works on the boardwalk. I guess you pay and  you shoot him with paintballs and  you win a prize. Yeah, if you hit him enough times.  And then there's a tie at this  moment in time for worst job.  Yeah, this is going to be a tough one.  The tie is between the guy who  picks up dead bodies all over  Bergen County and  the guy who weighs, separates,  and smells fat after  liposuction. And then the people come  back into the doctor's office and he has to massage  the area because I guess when you take out the fat 
[43:00]
 there's a hole there and you got to like kind of  move everything around and get it back  in a place. Like a big tube of toothpaste  that has a dent in it. Yeah, and it, ah!  Ah, just a thought. And he says  the smell is just horrible. And the guy  was so depressed on the  phony, he even knows he has a horrible  job. Yeah, he didn't like it. So those  guys are in the running for the other pair of tickets to see  Pearl Jam. Ah,  oh wow, there's another one on the line here.  Jesse, what's your job? Ah, I got  to get horses excited to  be on the lead. Ah! 
[43:30]
 Oh! And he has a real  problem. If you get, I don't know how to say it, if you get a real  fat woman, you have so much  fat, it's got to be weighed on a separate  scale. The record we had  was 14 pounds of lipids and  7 pounds of lucids. And  it was so much I had to stand on a  regular scale, weigh myself,  then pick this blob up  and  the odor is ridiculous.  Wait, that's only half of it.  Then when they come back like 6 weeks later,  I'm in charge of massaging the area 
[44:00]
 in which the fat has been taken out of.  Now I want to make a claim,  I've listened to all the other people,  I think I could take the title in both categories.  I think you can actually.  Ah, alright, so your job is  you measure the fat  after people get the fat sucked out  of them. I have to  separate the fat. Separate it,  measure it, weigh it. I don't have  to smell it, but unfortunately I do.  And then you've got to massage the area when these people  come back into the doctor's office. Well, 6  weeks later they'll come back and 
[44:30]
 I have to massage it to flatten out the area  because, not to get too gross, but when  you take a heavy concentration of fat,  it leaves like a hole.  Would you loo for my stretch marks?  Exactly.  And there you have it, Rich,  who has won the competition for  the worst, sorry, worst job in the New York  area. Mr. Fat  Sucked Fat Weigher. Yeah, maybe we could  bring him down to Giant Stadium too when we broadcast  live. He could bring some of that fat and  throw that on the grill when we're tailgating.  With shoot Ed, 
[45:00]
 throw it at Ed. That would be a great  party. You've got shoot Ed and a guy  cooking up some fat on the barbecue  before the Giants game. Lovely.  Alright, we're not done yet.  We have one more pair of tickets to  Sea Pearl Jam. We'll blow them out on the phones  before 7 o'clock, so stay right there.  1027 WNEW  The Rock of New York with Ever Clear.  I will buy you a new life. It's Opie  and Anthony Funk. Finishing up  another program here, I guess. They go so fast  today. We had a lot  of fun today. Oh, there go the phones. These guys 
[45:30]
 are smart. They know. Alright, we'll give  away one more pair of tickets to Sea Pearl Jam,  the sold out show. We'll  take, let's take  the 7th caller at  212-757-1027,  okay? You're going to win Sandy  a big furry stuffed animal tonight?  Are you really going to the Fireman's Fair?  Yeah. That's like our youth.  I know. A lot of people don't think we're  like from here, which makes us laugh.  No, out on the island, we used to  go to this like every year. Green Lawn's 
[46:00]
 Fireman's Fair.  Yeah, you people, Opie from  Green Lawn, Harborfield. That's right.  We used to kick your ass. And I was from  John Glenn. We hated John Glenn. So we used  to go over to the Green Lawn Fireman's Fair and start  trouble with you guys. See, now we can  all get along. It's almost like  Khalid Muhammad's  March. Oh yeah, just like that. Yeah,  can't we all just get along? Look, now we're on the air  together. Partners. Yeah, they don't know  what goes on off here. Opie  and Anthony  live together 
[46:30]
 imperfect.  Matter of... I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  Gross. Sit your crack ass  down. What the hell was that?  What the hell was that? It shows  that Harborfield and  John Glenn could get along.  You have a crush on me or something? Oh yeah,  that's it. What the hell are you singing to me for?  I'm a married man. Keep your  fantasies to yourself. Oh,  that's your excuse.  Just because you're married doesn't, you know,  mean you're straight. Yeah, Jen's a beard. 
[47:00]
 She's been a beard for  eight, nine years, sure.  And I'm not married. I'm flaming.  All right, speaking of  flaming, I don't know. Can we play it again?  Oh, Jesus.  After  Danny from Soho  called and got all upset  with your language earlier. You're going to  play this for Gay Square  Dancing Month. Didn't we get a lot of requests  for this? Yes, we did.  All right, well, September is International Gay 
[47:30]
 Square Dancing Month. And we  still haven't called the founder of this. Maybe  we could call him tomorrow. Oh, there's plenty of days left  in the month. By the way, tomorrow on the show we will have more  Pearl Jam tickets as well. All right.  But do we have time to quickly play this?  Okay, yeehaw. Put your hat on.  All right, what was the setup again, Anthony?  It's Gay Square Dancing Month. And  I guess they'd have to do a few different  calls. Okay. 
[48:00]
 Yee-haw!  Now your partner's pretty big.  Drilling like an oil rig.  Promenade and grab a beer.  Open it in your partner's rear.  Yee-haw!  Woo-hoo!  Great, Ant. Thank you. 
[48:30]
 What?  I wasn't even paying attention. What happened?  What did I do? Oh, nothing. Another train wreck.
