 Skidmarks, he was on our show last week.  Yes.  He called in with a little song, he's 12 years old.  He called in with a Bill and Monica song.  Well now he sent his little tape.  He does song parodies, he's 11 years old.  He put us to shame.  He has more creativity than you and I put together, I do believe.  It doesn't take much.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm quite honest.  But he FedExed the package and he's got three songs for us to play today.  He's got a Titanic one.  Yup.  He's got a Charles Grodin one. 
[00:30]
 Yeah, Charles Grodin, toupee song from Skidmarks and a song he likes to call, I like to fart.  Alright.  It will be nice to hear our 11 year old doing fart humor instead of us.  And he's coming on the show?  Is this what I hear?  Yeah, I think he's going to stop by tomorrow.  I feel special.  I feel like a celebrity is going to be on our show for once.  We'll have him in the imaginary ballroom.  Yeah, Skidmark jamming tomorrow on the Open Anthony show.  If you're a faithful listener of the program, you know who he is.  Also, I'm very excited to bring back Road Rage today. 
[01:00]
 Yes, it's one of our most popular bits with the faithful listeners.  We haven't done one in about a month and a half.  We have the tape going for the lovely commute in today and we're going to get that on later.  Yeah, actually I'm going to try to get it on before the end of the hour.  Are you?  Yeah.  Good.  Because there were some classics today.  The guy delivering the pork is priceless.  My favorite was the guy illegally parked in the limo.  Yeah.  We might have to set that up because I don't know if we got the audio. 
[01:30]
 I think we might have.  All right.  We'll see.  On the way, we got the Road Rage bit.  If you've got something for the show, you know the deals.  The People's Radio Show, we encourage you guys to participate in our lovely program.  There are many ways you can do it.  The first way is through the instant feedback.  WNEW.com.

[02:00]
 Throw it into the studio.  Anthony reads most of them on the air, actually.  It's a way to get in.  It's the back door.  Yeah, the back door to the show.  Fax line 212-957-WNEW.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  Two for Tuesday with the Goo Goo Dolls.  That's name and slide before that off their latest CD, Dizzy Up the Girl.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  The faxes are spilling in like crazy.  This one says, I'm going to be a good friend of yours.  I'm going to be a good friend of yours.  I'm going to be a good friend of yours.  I'm going to be a good friend of yours.  I have never heard them on WNEW. 
[02:30]
 We play Alice in Chains.  Not enough.  If you ask me, I love Alice in Chains.  This person says, if you do, you will jump from preset number five to preset number one  on my car radio.  We got to play it then today.  Well, there are way one, two, three, four.  No, that's okay.  Take five is acceptable to us because that's the first set of presets.  We'll take five.  We just don't want to be preset eight.  I've been reading a lot of email from people.  We're moving all over the presets.  Are we? 
[03:00]
 But a lot of them, yeah, we're falling into the between three and five.  Just that whole area, three, four, five.  We just want to be one of the first six.  It takes something really big to boost you to that first spot.  That's your favorite stage.  That's the one you don't even have to take your eyes off the road when you hit that button.  There's my station.  There you go.  And we want to be that.  And Bonnie writes, Hi, open it.  My friend Sandy is going out to Montauk right now to go fishing for the day.  And guess what she has?  She has a big banner with open Anthony, a logo, and it says you got to listen or you 
[03:30]
 don't know what you're missing.  102.7.  Any W say hello to her from her friend, Bonnie.  See?  Well, that's good, but she's part of phase two, though.  But out of Montauk.  Yeah, but I'm sure she's driving from the city to Montauk.  She'll advertise the show all through the LIE.  I thought she just had the banner out of Montauk.  Yeah, that wouldn't be a good thing.  But we are looking for people to promote our show for us. 
[04:00]
 Phase two, yes.  Phase two is telling others about open Anthony.  So we appreciate that Bonnie and friend.  And then this guy writes, it's from Tom.  He's offered me a free weekend of fishing so I don't have to go to any more Apple festivals  and pumpkin picking and stuff.  Tom, you rule.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  Oh, we had to go pumpkin picking this weekend.  I think everyone knows I had to go pumpkin picking because the email went nuts.  That's right, because I'm sure, I am sure, as God is my witness, next weekend, me and 
[04:30]
 Oprah are going to go out and we're going to the clubs or something.  We're going to go watch some football at the bar or something, right?  Real manly weekend next weekend, right?  So anyway, on the way, we got some Tom Petty.  You mean you can't hang out?  Gee, I wonder what you're doing.  Tell everybody what you're doing next weekend after this weekend of pumpkin picking.  I'm going north.  Yeah, you're going up north.  Yeah.  Must be something really cool to do. 
[05:00]
 Yes.  Where are you going?  Our old stomping ground up there in Massachusetts.  I'm going to check out the leaves.  What?  I'm going to check out the leaves.  Check out what?  Leaves.  What?  Leaves?  Yeah.  Well, Opie now goes from pumpkin picking out on Long Island to this weekend, he's going  to go up north to watch the leaves change.  I'll give you a hint, though.  Well, it's prime.  It's prime up there.  Is it the prime peak color?  Peak color is happening. 
[05:30]
 So you're going to drive a couple of hundred miles to go see the leaves.  Yep.  You want a little hint?  You want a little clue?  Let me clue you in on something.  If you wait a couple of weeks, it looks the same here.  See, it's a little south of where you're going to be going.  So down here, they turn a couple of weeks later.  So you mean if I wait a couple more weeks, I can just look out my window?  You look at leaves.  You have to drive around and look at leaves.  That's just something you do when you're on your way somewhere cool during the fall. 
[06:00]
 And you're like, hey, look at the leaves.  That's kind of cool.  Park the car.  Let's go ahead and catch the game.  Yeah, I'm going out of my way to see leaves.  Yes, that's going to be great.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Where's my bullwhip?  Where's my bullwhip?  I got to do it again.  Come on.  All right, here's Opie.  I got my bullwhip that I got yesterday.  I could crack this pretty good.  I'm like Indiana Jones.  Here's Opie.  Figure it out.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  You get it? 
[06:30]
 Yeah, I think everyone got it.  I think so.  Anthony.  What?  You're no different.  What are you doing this weekend?  I'm different.  You got cornered in bed this morning.  Yeah, Jen heard the show yesterday talking about how guys and girls plan things differently.  Guys don't really plan things.  Well, that guy late in the show yesterday made a great point.  He said that guys don't start thinking about the weekend until Thursday, Thursday afternoon.  Most women start thinking about weekend plans on Monday. 
[07:00]
 That's the problem that guys are facing.  We got to get more organized and start thinking about our weekend on Monday.  Then we'll have a say in what is going to happen every weekend instead of just being  led into something.  Right.  So what did your wife say the second I woke up?  Because she heard the show yesterday.  Yeah.  She goes, got any plans for this weekend?  And then I'm trying to think, God, I got to have some kind of plan.  You know, she's got a plan.  She's got plans.  So if I don't have plans, all of a sudden I have plans. 
[07:30]
 They're not my plans, but they're plans.  So obviously you didn't have any plans on the weekend.  So what are you doing this coming weekend?  All friends are coming down from Massachusetts.  And?  We're going to hang out with them.  And?  And what?  I know it's something stupid.  And?  I think we're going to check out some of those wineries out here.  Shut up.  Give me the whip.  Give me the whip.  Oh, come on.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, 2 for 2, 6.  With Tom Petty listening to our heart and freefalling. 
[08:00]
 Freefalling was the song you had to be listening for this hour to win the Kenny Wayne Shepard  tickets and Joe Carrington of Chester, New York, he was paying attention.  And now he's got a pair of tickets to see the taping of the VH1 Hard Rock Live presented  by American Express and the Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  Tom and Westfield. 
[08:30]
 Yeah.  He doesn't like freefalling.  But Tom Petty, for that reason, he just moved us to preset seven.  Ah!  We lost.  We lost ground.  Man, we walk such a fine line, don't we?  We can't win.  Come on, Tom.  Give us a break.  Come on, man.  Give us number six.  So we're not on the preset B's.  Yeah.  We're not on his second set of presets that you don't even know how to get to.  For one lousy song?  Come on, Tom.  Bump us back up to at least six. 
[09:00]
 Yeah, maybe someone out there really likes freefalling and they'll bump us from preset  eight to preset five.  I don't know how to deal with this.  We've got to make up the losses here.  We can't lose any more listeners.  We really need to start gaining listeners at this point.  Oh, well.  Doesn't anyone understand that?  All right.  Later on, I think we're going to be talking with Reverend Al Sharpton.  Yeah, what is he up to?  He's going to Haiti.  Why is he going to Haiti?  Check out the damage done by Hurricane George. 
[09:30]
 Oh, this just in.  Hurricane George has been downgraded to a fall breeze.  A stiff breeze.  Stiff breeze, so some leaves might fall off your trees in front of your house.  Reverend Al's pissed off from what I hear.  He's blaming the hurricane on the white man.  And we're going to be talking to him a little later.  I can't wait to hear that.  I can't either.  I'm sure it'll all make sense coming from Reverend Al.  Also the staff of the Opie and Anthony Show, hard at work editing our Road Rage tape. 
[10:00]
 The staff.  That's me and you.  I hope he's doing it while the songs are on.  I'm doing it while the songs are on.  So as soon as we get that edited, we'll put it on the air.  People enjoy when we have Road Rage on the way into work.  We had a couple of good stupid MFs on the road today.  The best was the pork guys.  We saw a few of them on our way in today.  Riding a bicycle.  Riding the bicycle.  I ride my swing bicycle to deliver Mung Chang pork.  1027 WNEW, The Ride to New York, two for Tuesday with Bruce Springsteen, Candy's Room and Pink 
[10:30]
 Cadillac.  The box set I do believe is coming out November 17th if I'm not mistaken.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A little later this hour you've got to be listening for Foxy Lady from Jimi Hendrix.  If you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you've got a pair of tickets to see Kenny  Wayne Shepard.  Opie, we are not alone in our suffering at times when we have to do these things on the  weekends with the girlfriend, wife. 
[11:00]
 You know how guys are.  We never make plans so we're always included in the woman's plans.  Brandon, out on Long Island.  Hey guys, there's a good chance I'll run into either one of you two this weekend.  My wife is undecided about which ride is shorter.  Either out to Long Island to the winery or up north so Opie can watch the leaves change.  Is he going to watch the leaves change this weekend?  He doesn't know.  At this point his wife is undecided. 
[11:30]
 She hasn't decided yet.  Yeah, of course.  She's got to decide.  Okay.  We've got another fax here.  I guess Paul, I heard your show, topic about plans.  I've been married seven years and it just doesn't matter what day I submit my plans  for approval, they are vetoed.  Tell Anthony that the winery tour is among the worst of the weekend.  I had to endure five hours with her parents sipping wine.  Just shoot me next time and spare me the agony.  Tell him just to start convulsing after the second glass and maybe he can spend the day 
[12:00]
 in the emergency room.  It has to be more enjoyable.  I love the sarcasm.  Oh my God, really?  Jeff writes in an email, okay, I have you guys on preset one, but if I hear another  Goo Goo Doll song, you go on to preset eight.  They're holding us hostage.  They are holding us hostage.  We got one girl who's going to make us preset one if we play Owls and Chains.  The other guy's going to take us off his presets altogether if we play Free Falling again.  Here's a guy who's going to take us off if we play the Goo Goo Dolls again. 
[12:30]
 There's another guy that says F the guy that doesn't like petty.  Don't stop playing petty on that idiot's request.  I suffered through the hooch.  He doesn't like that song.  I'll be back on Friday to send a big F you to the guy that said not to play petty.  This is great.  Right on.  All right, the facts live.  You want in on the conversation today.  212-957-WNEW.  Still got to get to the Yankees and all sorts of other things happening around town. 
[13:00]
 Give us a call or give us an instant feedback there.  Go to the WNEW website and click on our pictures and that instant feedback will go right to  us here in the studio.  The Rock in New York 1027-WNEW.  Two for Tuesday with Harold Smith.  Train kept a roll in all night long and crazy from the Get a Grip CD.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good news, Anthony.  What?  Our Road Rage is just about edited and ready for airplay.  We're going to do that in the five o'clock hour and say it's a bit that a lot of the  faithful listeners really, really enjoy. 
[13:30]
 Well, it's because they can relate to it.  Yeah, they can relate to that.  Driving in.  And the best part about it is the comments we make in between cursing out drivers.  We talk about all the people we see on the sidewalks.  It's brutal, actually.  I usually don't remember it.  I black out when I drive in.  Yeah, I just can't take the pressure.  It's a taste of reality, though.  Also on the way, we got Al Sharpton making a visit today.  Yeah, he's going to Haiti.  OK.  See how much damage was done by the hurricane.  Now, when is Al supposed to make his appearance? 
[14:00]
 Like they haven't had this huge thing that's full of wind hit them already.  Reverend Al's going to visit, too.  I don't know.  I think as soon as...  Soon as you write it?  As soon as I write it.  Reverend Al will be on.  I have a time schedule.  It takes a lot of thinking of things that rhyme with cash.  Yeah, if anyone can help us out, we need to rhyme for cash at this point.  This is how we do our show.  I don't think we're polished enough to have it figured out before we come on the air. 
[14:30]
 No.  If you've got to rhyme for cash, yeah, fax it in.  That's the one, two, nine, five, seven, W, N, E, W.  Got to get the listeners at all.  Great.  Now you're going to get 6,000 faxes.  Lash, ash, mash.  All right.  Thank you.  Any type of rhyme with money usually helps out the bit.  Also, I've got the Skidmark songs.  You want to hear a little ditty real fast here?  Our little pal Skidmark.  We kind of like this guy because he's immature like us.  We're in our 30s though and he's 11. 
[15:00]
 I think he's 12.  Isn't he?  He's 12.  Oh, okay.  He's moving up there.  But when you're that age, it's a big difference.  It's not like, I'm 34 or 35.  Yeah, 11 and 12.  A boy is like, big deal.  Well, 12 and 13 is the big difference though.  That's true.  I just mean one year makes a lot to a kid.  Well, he called us Friday with this great song about Bill and Monica.  We laughed pretty hard and then he FedEx'd us.  He's pretty sharp.  With other song parodies he did.  I could just see his mom playing the piano at home while little 12-year-old Skidmark 
[15:30]
 sings a ditty.  Skidmark.  Would you like to hear a song?  I like to fart or the Charles Grodin toupee song?  I want to hear the Charles Grodin toupee song.  All right.  We can play that.  This is our new pal Skidmark or Skidmarks.  Skidmarks.  Skidmarks.  He's coming in tomorrow actually to perform live.  In the imaginary ballroom.  On our show.  He's going to jam.  Well, we're just like Rosie O'Donnell having kids on the show.  Well, it helps her ratings. 
[16:00]
 Only it's a little bit more twisted.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right.  So this is 12-year-old Skidmarks and his lovely little tune about Charles Grodin's hair piece.  Charles Grodin wears a funny little ratsy ass toupee on his bald head.  And I can't determine if the damn thing is either living or dead.  Maybe he should take it for a check up at the local SPCA. 
[16:30]
 For I think that little Wiglet needs assistance in the worst way.  Come on.  He's 12 and he's making up songs about Charles Grodin's toupee.  That's good.  He's got a career.  What were you doing at 12?  Nothing.  Exactly.  Nothing.  I was delivering penny savers on Long Island at 12.  You at least were motivated.  I was doing nothing.  Oh, did daddy just give you an allowance? 
[17:00]
 No, sorry.  Daddy left when I was 11 I think.  So no, daddy wasn't around Opie.  So how did you get your money for your baseball cards?  I don't know.  I think I stole it.  I don't even know.  I blocked all that out of my head.  The scary part is if I pressured you I think you probably did steal it.  Yeah, I probably did.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Alright.  Would you like to hear his other song real fast?  Which one is this?  The I like to fart song.  All 12 year old kids like to fart. 
[17:30]
 That's probably what I was doing when I was 12.  Yeah, that's it.  I was farting all the time.  Alright.  Let's do this.  Do we have the intro on here too?  The little skid marks intro?  Alright, check this out.  I got a song for you.  Anyone out there want to pull my finger?  I like to fart.  I'm a master of this art.  I pass a lot of air through my derriere. 
[18:00]
 No one can surpass  my skill of passing gas.  My technique of ripping farts is highly state of art.  How old are we? 
[18:30]
 Well, he's 12 so I guess we're on the same level.  Oh man.  1027WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Jimi Hendrix, Hey Joe and Foxy Lady.  Foxy Lady was the song you had to be listening for this hour to score the tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard and John Boda of Staten Island was paying attention and he's got a pair of tickets to the taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live presented by American Express and The Rock of New York.  1027WNEW.  The next song you got to be listening for is Brass in Pocket by The Pretenders. 
[19:00]
 Sometime in the five o'clock hour we'll do that and all you have to do is be the tenth caller to score the Kenny Wayne Shepard tickets.  Doing this all day long for you by the way.  Very busy day.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A lot of people liked Skidmark's songs that we just played a little while ago.  Very cute.  A talented little kid, right?  Isn't he?  Yes.  On the way we got Al Sharpton making a visit.  1027WNEW.  The Rock of New York, Two Per Tuesday by David Bowie.  The man who sold the world. 
[19:30]
 Someone called up and said, I thought Nirvana did that song.  No, it's David Bowie's song.  Nirvana did a little cover of that.  Also Golden Years before that.  Opie and Anthony, Two Per Tuesday.  Al Sharpton will be calling in in about a half hour.  He's going to Haiti.  Going to Haiti and he's going to discuss his little trip with us today.  Like they haven't had enough big wind down there.  Now they've got to deal with Al.  Reverend Al is going to go down.  Right on.  He's on a fact-finding mission.  Really?  That's what the paper says. 
[20:00]
 What's he going to find out?  That a lot of people died, I guess.  Which is obviously very tragic.  Yeah, but I don't know what he's going down there for.  You sure he's not going down there for his own purposes?  Not Reverend Al.  He wouldn't go down there to try to raise money for his own causes, would he?  Opie, now stop it.  Personally, I don't know how Reverend Al gets his money for those nice suits that he wears these days.  And the big medallions and stuff.  And airfare to go to Haiti.  And the hair products.  The hair products alone have to amount to thousands of dollars a month. 
[20:30]
 Does anyone know what Al does for a living when he's not marching?  He's always marching or flying off now to Haiti.  No, I'm serious. I'm curious. Does anyone really know what he does?  He must have a job when he's not doing that no justice, no peace thing.  That's his job. I don't know. He's going down with other members of the clergy.  Okay. All right, we'll get in Al's head in a little bit.  We've got that Reverend thing.  Yeah.  Matchbook cover.  Well, they finally handed over the road rage bit.  All right.  So we finally had to get all the curses out of it and make it radio friendly. 
[21:00]
 I wish they would get into like, maybe at the turn of the century we'll be able to curse on the air.  That's kind of stupid that we can't.  Everyone knows. Okay, watch. Here's a little test.  Yeah.  The F word.  Okay.  Go ahead. Say it in your head. Ready? Go.  All right.  Very good.  Everyone knows what I meant.  And everyone heard that word at least once today.  Yeah.  So, can't say it though.  What if like I say the first part and you say the second part?  Oh, I don't know.  Are we breaking rules? 
[21:30]
 I don't know. Maybe there's a gap that's got to go in the middle.  Like if I say, I don't know. Can we get?  Can we get?  It.  Oh, there you go. I don't know.  I don't even know what the ruling is on that.  As long as there's a gap. I mean, I don't know.  I just said the F.  And you said the C.  Is that way around the rule? I don't know.  Who knows? I don't even know what the rules are.  Are we going to be fine for even experimenting with that? Who knows? 
[22:00]
 Probably.  All right. So from time to time, we like to tape ourselves on the way into the city.  And if you've never heard this before, what you're going to hear, you got to like set the scene.  Yes.  It's me and Anthony having lots of road rage, mostly Anthony, because he drove today.  I drive. It's like a scene out of The Road Warrior when I'm driving.  Yeah.  I have a mission. I have to get from point A to point B.  There are people in my way and I'm taking it personally.  There you go.  And in between cursing out other drivers, we make fun of every single person we see on the sidewalk.  You got to comment. 
[22:30]
 And we don't do these bits often because it's kind of scary to roll down your window and start screaming at complete strangers in the middle of Manhattan.  We do it when we don't have tape rolling.  It's true. But all right. Well, here's our ride in today. Check it out.  What is she smiling about? Get out of the lane. Now she's on the brakes. God damn it.  How's the right?  Good.  Look at this idiot.  He's got a left turn on the left turn on a bridge, you asshole. 
[23:00]
 There he is.  I got my bicycle. I don't get that one.  God damn it.  That's funny.  Look at this guy.  Look at the size of this.  Oh my God.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  No, really. The big orange afro is making a comeback.  Look at that.  Exact shade of Ronald McDonald.  Don't walk me. Don't walk. 
[23:30]
 That's a felon.  Fucking assholes.  Move.  What do you think they hide under those turbines?  Seriously.  Oh, look at this old lady.  Ain't gravity a bitch?  Holy shit.  Why is she liping? Tough night.  Look at all the dirty little girls going into Victoria's Secret.  You're a filthy girl, aren't you?  You buy daddy a teddy.  Don't let him in. Don't let him in. 
[24:00]
 He ain't getting anywhere.  Denied.  Get out of here.  Come on.  There's another one.  Hey, pork.  Where you deliver our pork?  Is that Wing Chang's or Tau Fong's pork?  With all these skewers, it started to look like downtown Hanoi.  Look at the size of this guy's bike chain.  It's as big as the Titanic anchor.  Why even bother at that point?  Because if he lose bike, he can't deliver pork.  Yeah, but the chain costs more than the bike at this point. 
[24:30]
 That van hates you.  Fuck him.  Uh-uh. Uh-uh.  Oh, come on with these fucking people.  Yeah, just stop right there.  Look at this guy.  Fuck you.  Oh, he trying to make you your bitch.  Fuck him.  That brownie lady knocking on the guy's hood,  trying to get him to move his car.  I bet you she's going to get the ticket.  She's knocking on his hood.  He's not happy.  She made you her bitch.  It's the only time I'll listen to a black person.  Are you kidding? 
[25:00]
 It's the only time you'll listen to a black person.  Holy shit.  Can you feel the love?  Man, that's harsh.  Move, fucking cabbie.  Move.  Where you going?  Where the fuck are you going?  Oh, that's a killer move.  He don't like girls.  He's got a World War II Nazi helmet on.  I see that.  He's got a Nazi helmet on.  Jesus.  Oh, good.  And we made it. 
[25:30]
 What's he eating?  O.B. and Anthony, 1027.  Oh, Reverend Al is on hold.  We'll talk to Mr. Sharpton next.  At least it sounds like Mr. Sharpton.  1027WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Nirvana.  That song is about a girl from the Unplugged CD.  And come as you are, of course, before that, a couple from the Unplugged CD.  Sophie and Anthony, got to say hi to everyone on their way to the stadium for the big game tonight. 
[26:00]
 Yeah, Yankees.  It's going to be a horrible ride to the stadium, though.  Yeah.  Raw shower, you've got to put on a long wait.  But we'll try to keep you entertained.  Yes.  Keep it on NEW.  And if you like what you hear today, make us one of your presets.  That's what we're going for, right?  Yes, we are going for that.  Top preset.  Yes.  Well, O.B., as we said before, Reverend Al is heading to Haiti.  He's part of a contingent of clergy that's going down there.  And he's on some kind of fact-finding mission. 
[26:30]
 I don't know what he's looking for, what kind of facts.  Well, he's going to see how much damage there was and see what he can do to help out the poor people down there.  Well, I think, wow, I'm seeing a lot of money in the paper.  You know, United States is shipping like a half a million dollars worth of supplies to the Dominican Republic.  Puerto Rico alone damage is expected to top two billion dollars.  Wait a minute.  Two billion dollars in Puerto Rico?  Doesn't something have to be worth a certain amount before it can be damaged that much? 
[27:00]
 Well, anytime I see it, how much is a tin shack cost?  I saw the news footage.  All the like big buildings and stuff on the beachfront, that was fine.  Nothing happened to those.  No, the big expensive hotels are just fine.  Yeah, it seemed to be like the shantytowns that blew down.  Yes.  They don't take the words of the Three Little Pigs book.  Straw blew away when the big bad wolf did it.  Yeah.  Hay, same thing.  Bricks stands up to the wind. 
[27:30]
 Okay.  Reverend Al going to Haiti.  Yeah, I guess he's, I don't know.  Yeah, what's he looking for?  What's he doing down there?  He just wants to lend his support, obviously.  Well, let's talk.  Maybe he's going to get a hammer and start rebuilding the shantytowns.  I don't think so.  Take that big ass medallion of his and hammer some nails in.  Use it like a hammer.  Yeah, clang, clang, clang.  All right, Al's on the phone.  Let's get to him here.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace. 
[28:00]
 All right, Al, calm down.  Open the gate, I'm coming to Haiti.  I am on a fact-finding mission.  I believe the white man has a weather machine and is using it against people of color.  Come on, you're out of your mind.  Haven't you seen Simon Ball Sinister on the underdog cartoon?  Yes.  He had a weather machine and he is a white man.  Why do you think they call that country Haiti?  I don't know, Al, why? 
[28:30]
 Because whitey Hakeys the black man.  Have you ever seen a hurricane from a satellite photo?  Yeah, I have.  Now what color is it?  It's usually white.  It is white.  Why aren't there no black hurricanes?  Because they are products of the white man.  Wait a minute, Reverend Al, most hurricanes originate in Africa.  Well, yes, and they are brought here from Africa against their will to do the white man's dirty work. 
[29:00]
 Now that sounds familiar, doesn't it?  Now I need donations for the devastation.  People are suffering.  Send your cash to Reverend Al.  My wallet will be engorged with your cash for the victims of George.  My hair can withstand hurricane-force winds, but these houses in Haiti could not.  The roof caved in, so let the cash flow begin.  Send your checks to Reverend Al at the Apollo Theater and make them out to my organization, Care About Suffering Haitians. 
[29:30]
 Now for short, you could just put C-A-S-H.  Now I can't be lazy, I gots to go to Haiti.  The director of New Jersey was paying attention and he's got a pair of tickets to see Kenny Wayne in the taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live presented by American Express and the Rock of New York, 1027WNEW. 
[30:00]
 There you go.  People like the Al Sharpton thing.  Thank you.  That was a lot of fun.  Wow, someone's saying we're a racist, Opie.  We're racist?  Yeah.  Why are we racist?  Because hey, you're too racist.  That drunken woman's going to beat her kids all over again.  Wait a minute.  Oh, what the hell?  Remember her?  Yeah, I saw her. 
[30:30]
 I cannot believe you.  You definitely ain't trying to make friends and get listeners in the black community.  Huh.  I'll get the drunk lady.  Hold on.  I screwed up.  Yeah, well, this lady, she was calling us a racist last week.  Because we were talking about Sammy Sosa and how everyone in Washington Heights was soaping up their window with Sosa 66.  So this lady thought we were racist.  Check this out.  Hi, NEW.  Yeah, now racism is something that you put on the air too. 
[31:00]
 Is there no stopping you guys?  Is there no damn stopping you guys?  You're still conscious?  This friggin'  I thought you'd be passed out by now.  This friggin' guy falls up to speak guy and you're making fun of him?  He can write whatever the hell he wants on his car with his soap, okay?  He can write down that 1027 bad station if he wants to.  Hello?  You're a rip, lady.  Hello?  Thank you. 
[31:30]
 Hello?  Yeah, what?  Listen, I don't want any more racism.  I already beeped my husband and he's going to call you guys, he said.  And he's really mad, okay?  All right.  And me listening to you is going to make his dinner cold.  And he comes home with a dinner call.  I don't know what's going to happen.  It's going to be on your head, you racist.  You racist.  Say you're a racist, accept it. 
[32:00]
 Say you're a drunk, accept it.  No, I don't want.  Who's your husband, Jack Daniels?  Listen, I like gin, okay?  Bombay sapphire gin.  All right, we gotta go, we gotta go.  1027 WNOW, The Rock of New York with the cars on Two for Tuesday.  Later this hour, you gotta be listening for Selling the Drama from Live to pick up those tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard.  10th caller will get them when you hear that song.  The phone number here is 212-757-1027. 
[32:30]
 You're hanging with Oprah and Anthony.  Hello.  How are you?  Yeah, good.  You catching any new TV shows?  I caught ER last week.  Did you?  Yeah.  Was it good?  It was kind of disappointing.  Really?  Yeah.  See, the new season's coming out and I haven't watched one new show.  Well, I don't watch sitcoms anymore.  No.  Except for, well, I do watch Frasier.  Frasier's good.  It's funny.  Although, I didn't like the premiere episode.  No.  I don't know.  I think they're all losing it.  As I look through the paper, I see the desperate UPN network who actually had the Dice Man at one point lost that catch. 
[33:00]
 You know whose birthday it is today?  Oh.  The Dice Man.  Well, maybe we could get him in a little bit.  Well, he is sitting out there in the, wait.  Yeah, he's out there.  I think he's just kind of waiting around hoping someone's going to give him a birthday present today.  How old is he?  They say he's 40.  He can't be.  He's much older than 40.  He was 40 about five years ago.  Maybe Dice, yeah, we'll get Dice in a little while. 
[33:30]
 Yeah.  Oh, now he's looking at us.  No, Dice.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sit down.  Sit down.  We'll call for you.  Come on, let me in, guys.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's my birthday.  You're not going to let me in.  Hold the door.  Hold the door.  Don't let him in.  God, man.  Man, he's desperate for air time.  Always.  And he's always just hanging out in the NEW hallways.  We'll get him in later.  Happy birthday.  Anyway, UPN, new show, yes.  UPN going with, I think, shock value.  The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. 
[34:00]
 A lot of flack happening about this show.  UPN desperately seeking viewers is trying a mix of The Civil War and Benson.  Horrible concept and no better series.  This guy, Desmond Pfeiffer, is the butler for Abe Lincoln.  And he's a black guy.  And they have a whole series that revolves around this.  It's a wacky comedy about slavery and the Civil War.  That's zenerific.  Outrageous.  Not the worst show in TV history, though. 
[34:30]
 For being un-PC.  Yeah.  Hogan's Heroes, without a doubt.  Ah, you got a point.  Wins that hands down.  Yeah, those fun-loving wacky Nazis.  Wasn't that great?  As a kid, I'd watch Hogan's Heroes.  It's a comedy with swastikas in it.  Like they all had the armbands and everything.  Hogan!  A comedy that revolves around a concentration camp.  I love that show.  But we didn't know any better back then.  No.  Mad About You, debuting tonight.  That is the funniest show ever. 
[35:00]
 I can't stop laughing at Mad About You.  It is so funny.  You know what?  Let me see what's happening tonight on the premiere day  debut episode of Mad About You.  Because I'm sure the concept alone has got to crack me up.  Let's see.  Paul Reiser.  Oh, he's got a life-threatening problem and he's in the hospital.  And Helen Hunt is there weeping over his body as they wheel him into surgery.  Have you seen?  God, that show is hysterical. 
[35:30]
 Yeah, there's nothing better than terminal illness.  Is it a very special episode of Mad About You?  Every episode is a very special episode.  They had dramatic music in the beginning, slow motion footage where it's a very special episode of Mad About You.  It's a laugh riot!  You should have seen the commercial for it.  They say Helen Hunt in a dramatic, because she won the Academy Award.  So now she's no longer funny, I guess.  She can't be funny.  So now they've got some kind of problem where Paul Reiser is going to drop dead. 
[36:00]
 I am proud to say that I have never ever sat through an entire episode of Mad About You.  Thank you.  It's supposed to be funny.  And I'm sure on this show, he'll be ready to die and she's crying.  He's going, I love you, honey.  I love you.  And then he'll do something.  I hope I get a good doctor.  You know, like that nervous laughter in the middle of something that isn't funny.  And then by next week, they'll make believe that never happened.  It never happened. 
[36:30]
 I hate when they do that.  Everything's fine now, honey.  Everything's fine.  Oh, yeah.  I had a life-threatening illness last week, but now we're going to have some more wacky baby fun.  Last week, I remember they took my liver out.  Now I'm fine.  Now we could be funny again.  And you know you're getting older.  Well, we're only six short years away from actually being able to have a legal threesome with the Olsen twins.  Think about it. Isn't that frightening?  Six short years away from legally being able to bed the Olsen twins. 
[37:00]
 So how old are they?  And they were infants when that show was on.  What are they, like 10, 11 now already?  12 years old.  12 years old.  Okay.  The cute little Olsen twins have a new show on Friday.  It takes two, is it? Or the two of us?  It's always some two thing.  Are they still cute? I mean, what kind of topics are they going to tackle?  One of them is getting cuter than the other one, I've noticed.  Okay.  And you can tell one's going to be okay, and the other one might go down the hee-roo-road. 
[37:30]
 But one of them's looking okay.  I think in the premiere episode, they each get their period at the same time.  It's going to be cute.  One of them likes pads and one likes tampons, so it's going to be a wacky, goofy show.  Best show on TV, period.  TGIF.  There you go.  TGIF.  Cute little show.  That's wonderful.  I can't wait to go home and watch a little TV tonight.  Yeah, that's great.  My advice?  Watch the Yankees.  Get that Blockbuster account going. 
[38:00]
 Get your Blockbuster video card.  Rent them.  Yeah, watch the Yankees.  Oh, and a real world.  Just tonight.  I'm kind of losing interest.  You're losing interest in real world TV?  Real world started off real good.  Yeah.  But now it's kind of, I don't know.  Irene slapped, no, Stephen slapped Irene last week.  I slapped Irene last week.  That was pretty cool.  That was pretty intense.  You know what though?  I can't get over the good one, the one with punk.  Yeah, that was by far the best one.  There was nothing better than, punk, punk, I saw you. 
[38:30]
 You pick your scarce and then you put your finger in the peanut butter.  I saw.  I have a boyfriend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you move on.  Pedro had worse problems than worried about a dirty finger in peanut butter.  Yeah, Pedro had AIDS.  He had full blown AIDS and he's worried about a guy sticking his dirty fingers in peanut butter.  I mean, come on.  I think he should have worried more about something else being stuck somewhere else than fingers in peanut butter, Pedro.  Maybe they would have scared it a problem. 
[39:00]
 Yeah.  Then he got into a relationship.  I'm in a relationship right now.  You know, he's cute.  We're in love.  We're going to be married.  I cannot live in this environment.  This is not the healthy environment.  I'm going to have to lease the house.  It's either I go or fuck goes.  That was my favorite real world.  That was the best by far.  But this one isn't bad.  Seattle's pretty cool.  Yeah, I'm kind of losing interest though.  Irene called Steven out and said that he's gay and then Steven got really pissed and smacked her heart in the face. 
[39:30]
 The girl calls him gay and he slaps her.  I'll slap you.  Call me gay.  All right.  So it's going to be some implications.  You might have to leave the show for hitting a girl.  What do you think is going to happen with that one, Anthony?  I just hope on one real world, maybe in years to come, there's no one left.  They all get thrown out and they just tape an empty house for months.  Actually, I wish they would do the real real world and, you know, tape a bunch of guys living in their parents' house in the basement, you know, a bunch of guys that work at a deli. 
[40:00]
 Or paying rent.  Or paying rent.  Yeah, there's something.  That's actually real.  So all right.  There you go.  I don't even know where we're going now.  I think we have to play music here.  Oh, that's probably a good idea.  Oh, yeah, we do that on this show.  One oh two seven W.N.A.W.  The Rock of New York with live on two for Tuesday all over you and selling the drama.  Selling the drama was the song you had to be listening for to score the tickets to see Kenny Wayne Shepard and Dave Mason of Valley Stream, New York on the island was listening and paying attention. 
[40:30]
 And he's got a pair of tickets to see Kenny Wayne at a taping of VH1's Hard Rock Live presented by American Express and your friends at the Rock of New York one oh two seven W.N.A.W.  Very good.  Hey, you know, speaking of tickets.  Yeah.  I just noticed that we're giving away Aerosmith tickets beginning Friday at noon and we're going to do that all weekend long.  Wow.  That's good deal.  That is huge for Tuesday, October 13th at Jones Beach.  What?  I just remember last time we gave away Aerosmith tickets at the station we were at before we got fired. 
[41:00]
 Oh, yeah.  You know, because usually you give away tickets and people are very happy.  But you know where it is.  Tell the people.  People are very happy.  Like I would be pleased to win Aerosmith tickets from a radio station.  Secondary is where the seats are.  You know, just the fact that you're going is pretty cool.  Yeah.  We gave away Aerosmith tickets.  I guess.  What was that?  A couple of years ago, a couple of years back.  And this woman calls up and we thought she was going to thank us for him and just starts ragging us because the seats weren't good enough for her. 
[41:30]
 They were what were called lawn seats on the venue.  Yeah.  Which, you know, you got a bunch of rows of seats and then there's a grass area where you can put out a blanket and grab, you know, a bottle, whatever, party with your friends.  It's pretty cool.  As a matter of fact, she didn't like them.  No, not at all.  Bring your binoculars.  It's going to be a good show.  I'll wave to you from the front row.  So there you have it. 
[42:00]
 Wow.  But we are giving away Aerosmith tickets this Friday at noon and we'll do that all weekend long for you.  Sure.  I'm sure.  Appreciate it, wasn't she?  Now that we work at this fine radio station, we will have very good seats for the show.  Why didn't you let me say happy birthday?  I thought you were not saying happy birthday to me.  What the hell?  Rick, you were supposed to lock the door.  You weren't supposed to be like this today.  It's my birthday.  You're not going to say happy birthday to me.  Happy Birthday.  I thought you were with my pals.  Hi.  Happy Birthday.  You're not just going to sing me a song.  No, I'm not going to sing you a song.  You've been waiting out there for four hours just to come in, to have us wish you a happy 
[42:30]
 birthday.  I thought you would have a cake for me because you're my pals.  I thought you would have a birthday cake for me or something.  Uh, no, I'm sorry.  We don't dice so…  What are you going to do for your birthday?  I don't think you have many friends.  I got plenty of friends.  I used to be your birthday friend.  And I used to be your birthday friend.  And so I'm going to be your birthday friend.  You are going to be my birthday friend.  Now, think about it.  What are you going to do for your birthday?  I don't think you have many friends.  I mean, where are you going to go?  I've got plenty of friends.  I used to be somebody back in the 80s.  I packed out Madison Square Garden.  The key word?  You don't remember that?  The key word?  Used to.  I'm still playing. 
[43:00]
 I'm still packing clubs out.  Can I plug?  Yeah, all right.  Get a quick plug in for your birthday.  All right.  I'm going to be at Jimmy's Comedy Toilet in Jersey and I'm going to be at Laugh So Hard  I Popped a Nut in Poughkeepsie sometime next week.  I still got to verify.  All right.  But I'm still funny.  I'm still relevant.  I'm talking about all the big issues.  Oh, Pete.  Yeah, do you have a joke about any of the big issues, Dice?  Well, how about we got Bill and Monica in the Oval Office?  Oh, yeah, this is good stuff.  Well, how about Bill Clinton sitting in the Oval Office and Monica comes in and he's, 
[43:30]
 hey Monica, how about you give me a Lewinsky?  And she goes, oh, but you're the president.  And Bill goes, get over here and sing a song.  Oh, see, I still set him on fire laughing.  Dice, the problem is no one really wants to hear about the president.  It's been rehashed.  He goes to the bathroom.  He's in the bathroom next to the Oval Office with some chick and this chick looks up and  goes, oh, Mr. President, why do you still stay with Hillary? 
[44:00]
 He goes, because I could get a slut like you and a gibby.  Fun is to see you laughing your balls off.  That's how they're going to be at the comedy banana out of Trenton.  Is they going to laugh your balls off?  Dice, we're laughing at you, not with you.  Yeah, yeah, they keep saying that as long as you're laughing.  So Bill Clinton, he's on Air Force One, right?  And the stewardess comes by, oh, Mr. President, would you like a drink?  Yeah, and wouldn't you like one? 
[44:30]
 I'd buy a gaggy.  See, you're laughing your balls off of me on my birthday.  And by the way, they made a mistake.  Guys, just take them.  Just take them.  I want to say they made a mistake.  Take them away from the microphone.  They made a mistake on my birthday.  Take them away from the microphone.  I'm not 40.  I'm not 40.  Yeah, all right, get out of here.  I'm 35.  Yeah, get out of here.  So rude.  He takes my mic and I can't even talk.  Who let him in today?  We said we wouldn't have him in this week.  I don't know.  All right, Matt.  Disinfect this thing, please.  Matt, the vote is up next.  Matt, you giving away tickets?  Your mic's not on.  Just scream. 
[45:00]
 I don't know.  All right, Matt, we'll figure it out.  Matt, you're going to have to get the mic.
