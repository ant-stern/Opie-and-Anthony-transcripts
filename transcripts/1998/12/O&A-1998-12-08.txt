[03:30]
 and said this is the pool by you want people someone who would say three months  every three months you re-opt why i would say every week  right in the guys all rally behind the all be a long live opiates pullback  anthony out right which  after you received your humble last week  made me uh... the grandpa by the end of our dollars the role you made that you  would be the bob pooh by until i became a night club and i finally became a member  last tuesday and you throw me out  for a couple weeks and suspended for two weeks yeah yes 
[04:00]
 well all p  i seem to have found the tape  from  last week  two weeks ago on the last week whatever whatever what tape you got  a tape that proves that you know  initiated  the three month membership well i don't see this so-called tape in front of me  at the end i got it  you're right  good luck you'll hear it good luck playing on the air running people  because you will see what kind of a phony good luck who by is good luck i 
[04:30]
 have no idea what you're talking about well i do and i have it i listened on  the way and said  all these the one that came up with the three-month period  and he was the totally against me  and i admit i was wrong for then legislating it  but you know what i came up with the idea well you'll have to play a little  tape later i got right i will i will see what happens is ok fax line two one two  nine five seven w any w phones are going not to share one has a comment about our 
[05:00]
 jim morrison john lennon comments so will go to those next  i a m w  so you guys are all about what  today i think that's a lot of people  while i was driving one home from school  and uh... we've been seeing each other for a couple months now and  we would go to the at the end i got it initiated that day and then i that night  i went out somebody else and it was about six thirty and i told her about  it so i got another one  had to put to our is i got about three weeks there well they are 
[05:30]
 that means you got a lot of forever now  that's right there was a little bit of a  are going to break we appreciate that thank you very much congratulations back  alright by right  that's interesting cuz we are  we only started here in mid june yeah  uh...  and there was no doubt we've been here six months ready that's incredible  another happy customer for the two-day night armor club yeah  can someone explain the the  teach me hearings 
[06:00]
 doesn't mean anything to us  are they going to teach the president of the night  he was he was absolutely wrong and what he did  but for some reason he won't get impeached  now you know it's gonna happen  there's a lame duck congress  taking care of this business right now  and we're going to page to president map map map  now the new congress steps in after uh...  next year  started next year  and they have to start all over again are you serious and and all this to have 
[06:30]
 all this crap over again so why are they even bothering now  because their duty  he's not going to get impeached his lawyers  where where how far into this already  uh... it's been about almost almost a year once  and let's say the people that want him impeached uh... basically the republicans  are saying that he purged himself under oath  in the civil case  the polio 
[07:00]
 his attorneys  are saying  it wasn't perjury  yes he did mislead some people  and what he did was not right but it wasn't perjury and not an impeachable  offense  so that was when it first started  where are we now  savings have played in place  uh... nothing  is getting done in the country in the car it doesn't matter  just a key to going and going  and it's crap i believe  yes he should be impeached what he did was wrong 
[07:30]
 he's not fulfilling  his oath of office  to tell the truth  part of his own you know especially with people serving time in prison for exactly  what  he has done to me all of that he took when he gave his testimony  tell the truth the whole truth in nothing but to the truth everyone has seen it on  tv map million times  well they did he tell the truth  the whole truth and nothing but the truth  i know it's not  so it doesn't matter what the polls say  doesn't matter anything well didn't bring up that point 
[08:00]
 yeah but the people are sick of this and we should just move on that's what his  lawyers say  the people have spoken their tired of this and think it should all be just  thrown away  well the truth the matter is that the constitution is in a popularity poll  it's not uh... run by the polls  it's a written law  and if he did something  that uh... he should get impeached for  he should get impeached regardless of what the polls say  but his lawyers are wrangling in 
[08:30]
 and uh... the other people on the other side are  ten stars people  trying to get into it's a mess  it's a never-ending mess  that won't be settled  this he'll just  fill out the rest of the term  do you think will prosecute him after he leaves office though  wasted time it's just a huge waste of time i would like to money resources i  like to know what i would like to know what is not getting done in this country  because it's better all this time on this 
[09:00]
 this nonsense a lot of things that but then to clinton in a clever rules  trying to make it look like he's doing things you see him out every day  and he's done talking about social security today  but i think you're not doing anything is not doing anything that's ever going to  get through congress or anything is pretty much a lame duck president at  this point exactly he's walking around miserable than ever because he can't  get rid of hillary for a second these days to go get some trim who maybe  named 
[09:30]
 uh... man of the year man of the year well i think it has a man of the year  it may  but it may be hillary clinton she can be named man of the year  people are  how do you think a look at early of course you know  uh...  that's easy joke sorry  yes so it's just a never ending  that is just costing millions and millions of dollars and time and and  uh... work  hours  but uh... nothing 
[10:00]
 there's going to mount to  nothing yes  the right in new york one of these seven w any w two for tuesday david bowie  fashion from scary monsters one of those songs when i hear it brings me uh...  right back to being a kid watching mtv when it first hit the tube yeah because  i was one of the first videos fashion and uh...  i am a dj i am one of the  three washed out looking video and they've come a long way with the videos  but uh... every time i hear that or uh... you know uh... love is a 
[10:30]
 battlefield by pat bent or  that bent are hate the song but it brings me right back you know  boyster cold burning for you know  and i was standing on the cars around five here and and jay guile centerfold  yeah these are all the early videos look duties going to hit the snare drum and  like white paint gonna come out  to the lack  over to add on gun guns being done so far so that i got so long 
[11:00]
 that i would  awful but we have a lot of the videos  yeah i don't know about you but uh... we would sit around and watch the whole  rotation of of the videos all five yet and and what do they really have maybe a  i don't know two dozen yeah and it would take maybe two or three hours to play  through all of them and we would sit there and wait for burning for you to  come on again realize okay we've seen all the videos time go outside and play  and you have to sit through uh... 
[11:30]
 well they rewind the video i guess  and  uh... there's a shot of the astronaut on the moon and uh... alivia polar on  container  the  but  uh... the grand and i would pop on uh... burning for you again yeah  back to the beginning that was pretty much at the really have any videos now  they don't either  and now they just as they cannot i just don't play videos on mtv state they 
[12:00]
 truly need to get another channel is obvious they're so into the real world  the novels and it's it's not this week of the making of road rules real world  reunion  uh... contest behind the scenes camera people  made  technician  reunion special behind the scenes what  there does bill and they're just building ridiculous spin-offs from their  jobs 
[12:30]
 ridiculous this week we're gonna have the cast of the real world actually watch an  episode and comment while it's playing here at home can like you know type in  what you're seeing on the screen will put those comments up on the screen  and they will throw in some role role characters that you have spin that way  this will be really great people will love this and then i also in the the  real world will be no bump into a uh... fanatic  who's on their way to see uh... mariah carrie 
[13:00]
 uh...  yet road rules from the winnebago's point of view  who we haven't seen that yet  the bed and of that they just show the episodes over and over and over again  but now they got these new cool angles on the show show some videos yeah even  the videos that they think no one wants to say  because you know that musicians that were making videos that were on mtv years  ago  they still making videos  you know they get money from somewhere but you just never see him anymore now 
[13:30]
 when you love to see what kip wingers up to right now uh... would that be a  black just to sit there and watch a kid playing a new video i guess for a goof i  watch that  but but  the cat and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  well they got the canadian music channel that's uh... start a pop-up on all the  cable systems now really was a cold and uh... music or music or somebody i don't  get that you know get that now they show all the videos though  i don't get that nothing but videos you know you don't have to see you know sit 
[14:00]
 through stupid uh... you know tv shows and now i get the only other video  channel i get is uh... bt  oh yeah  black entertainment television i don't think you're allowed to watch the e t and  now  i'd shut the blinds and i i watch  on the floor  making sure that uh... black people watch me watching it's like all this is what  black people are up to it  people have to be in take near i don't know that is so slanted to the black  race is amazing 
[14:30]
 absolutely amazing i guess i guess uh...  yeah well that's how they feel when uh... they're watching town broke up i guess  i just don't get the uh... i don't get the new rap music all things i don't get  it  i don't want to be all that music with like dj jazzy jiff in the fresh prince  in  they wrapped to the music  now i want to admit this  the few the beats don't want to get their off there  doing something out of their body mccall and i got that but it's it's it's all  just this stream of consciousness in 
[15:00]
 paying no attention to the music anymore correct  i just like when like a puff daddy uh... is that uh... an award show  and then he uh... he talks about you know his inspiration for writing a song  and stuff like  you haven't written one song in your whole damn career you have sampled every  song you've you put out there  so don't get out there start talking about the you know your your writing  inspiration for for this song  with that song  you know and i was even a ripoff next 
[15:30]
 that's a good man  scrap some towns  you know you grab some old  town and and  dedicated to biggie and it makes uh... a crap load of money  i guess  uh... well as everyone knows by now it's uh... to for tuesday and it's also  uh... the tuesday night hammer club yes  and we are uh...  initiating new members as we speak i'm looking at the clock yes it's after  three o'clock that's when the initiation begins  so there are people out there right now getting initiated as we speak anthony 
[16:00]
 wonderful world which is a scary thought but there's a guy i think his name is  ray or something like that on the line who needs help  told good we're good at this time you know getting a homer tonight because he  wants to become a member of the club  we usually call up wives and girlfriends on tuesday for a couple of lucky guys  and we usually talk the girls into initiating them into the tuesday night  hammer club well we failed for the first time last week  she was brutal that lady we talked to last week was the reason why we came up  with the tuesday night hammer club yeah 
[16:30]
 she had the kids in the background she works two jobs  uh... and it's obvious that couple just doesn't have sex life anymore  no and that's why we started this club to maybe uh... initiate some uh... sparks  in some people's relationships bring it back before it gets to that point we  tried everything and she was as cold as they come and it is obvious that sex is  not a word in their dictionary and i felt bad for the guy so i'll end up  cheating soon  well let's see what this guy's all about  there and i hear you need help becoming a member of the tuesday night hammer club  yeah my wife's a little gunshot you know i've been asking her for a couple weeks 
[17:00]
 i think maybe a little push will help me out  and when was the last time you got a lovely homer from your wife  all saturday  saturday so what's the problem she just doesn't want to do it on a tuesday  we can't look up on tuesday she knows it's a radio thing you know this guy  greedy you are a little greedy  there are guys out there that haven't had a homer in years  well shame on it, yeah like opi  no that's not true  this guy just got one saturday 
[17:30]
 you got one like what three days ago  we can't use our powers of hummers  to get your wife to do this if you just got one saturday what about the poor guy  wait a minute there's some guy out there driving down the road that hasn't had a  homer in years going  why are they calling this guy  well it could be worse it could be me  we need a charity case you're not a charity case  what kind of club is it? I mean the more members the better  we gotta be million strong here  it seems to me like you could probably swing it yourself if you got one saturday 
[18:00]
 yeah well i don't know i keep trying on tuesdays and then she listens to you guys at home  so she knows about it  and that doesn't seem to work on tuesday  you know ray as the grand pool by the club i think i'm going to have to pass on your charity case  no way  hell yeah  there are other guys more deserving out there  you'll be doing a grave disservice to those people that really need hummers  no i've been faithful  that's terrible  our success rate is over ninety percent 
[18:30]
 i know why do you think i'm calling  that's why we gotta save for that special person that really needs the help  that's terrible  alright  you know the make a wish foundation doesn't send kids with a cold to disney  okay  you get what we mean  alright you guys are brutal  alright ray  alright guys thanks anyway  alright  see ya  one oh two seven w n e w the rock of new york two for tuesday with nirvana  about a girl from the unplugged cd  come as you are from nevermind before that it's opie and anthony 
[19:00]
 two for tuesday  there's a guy on the line that got his hummer  out of country  wow we gotta see what country he got his little hummer  hi any w  any w  here looking for opi and anthony you are live on the air what's up  boy i got some exciting news to share alright  uh... in the home with the way about a week ago  we get up in the morning  i get up to take a shower  i get out of the shower and uh... she's in the mood 
[19:30]
 uh... already clean  i'm already dried off  i'm already deodorant it up and be careful how you uh...  like uh... people into any activity or anything  all really  like all the honey  i'll be more than happy to take care of business  but uh...  i'd like a homer  it  no problem i don't  and i come in next tuesday  because i am very embarrassed to say but i would not at that point a member of  the two-day night on the corner right so you are going to save your homer to 
[20:00]
 become a member absolutely  as guys as one of us out there we realize they don't come often and we got  a kind of spread them out  you've got to make them uh...  worthwhile but now i wanted to put a my name in stone so to speak  and i know you guys are probably going to be working on the bylaws of the club  since it's growing at such a rapid rate and i wanted to be a little special in  the process  so i knew i was going to be going on vacation  so that tuesday i was going to be out of this country in a ruba 
[20:30]
 so i was hoping  that i'm the first reported inductee  into the two-day night on the club  outside the country of the u.s.a. i would have to give you that honor thank you  very much as called us on that  but you don't have a couple of people who are there something uh... now we're  very  very cheap around here  for cheap radio show  and i would expect it  that's cool  before the care that will will find out if anyone uh... can beat that right  but you became a member of the two-day night on the club in a ruba  absolutely i think someone out there might be able to be too but will will 
[21:00]
 will find out about the first reported one yes the first reported  thank you very good congratulations thank god i met with her by  it makes people so happy  you can just feel it out there you know  i don't think it's christmas coming around or anything that's missing joyous  and i think people in the hammer club  is making them happy and joyful i would have to agree with that and finish a  little we got our affiliate from san francisco on the line here anthony  on a Friday and his unit here there was a huge power failure 
[21:30]
 out in san francisco  everything went out not just every not just a couple neighborhoods the whole  city went out  they're finally restoring uh... power  but it's taken some time they get the airport up and running again  uh... but traffic lights were out uh... entire neighborhoods that transit system  every everything it was a complete mess  and we figure this is just such a huge story that we would get uh... one of our  filly it's online  and discuss uh... the mood of the city of san francisco well i i think so 
[22:00]
 because on the way and i was listening to ten ten wins and they had somebody  from san francisco that used to work at wins and uh... now they work for an  affiliate out there so i guess this is  somebody from our uh... sister station uh... san francisco yes i believe that's  what this is a right  okay i think his name is philip or something like that i have a light  it's not even copy and i think that the bank and franisco wait a minute your  name is philip eating cox that that's not what i had to do okay i mean it 
[22:30]
 anybody  confirmed that kept  spent  yet  at a packet  and make a claim  diames landing at the wheels  uh... 
[23:00]
 to Captain Dirk Studley. He says, due to the power outage, many elevators are stuck  between floors with the doors open. Very dangerous. So here everybody has been warned to stay  away from the shafts. Please stay away from the shafts. It is a sad day in San Francisco.  This is the elevator shaft. I must say it was very frightening when the lights went 
[23:30]
 out. I was deep inside Bart. What? You were deep inside Bart? You can't say that. Bart,  the Bay Area Rapid Transit. It's the subway, silly. And it's called Bart? Yes. Oh, you  don't know that? No, I didn't know that. I don't know anyone knew that. I was deep in  Bart when the lights went out. But during this difficult time, everyone here is standing  very closely behind each other. Oh, well boys, before it gets dark, I've got to find some 
[24:00]
 D-sized batteries. Where can I find those big D-sized batteries for the flashlight?  I have no idea. Oh well, Philip Eden Cox with a hyphen, live from the bay by the bay.  Bye, bye. Bye, Philip. Well, there you go, our affiliate in San Francisco. Even though 
[24:30]
 we had one. No, I did not know that. 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday with  Leonard Skinner. It's Opie and Anthony. And it is the Tuesday Night Hummer Club that is  happening right now. This was in the wrong CD case, Rick. Oops. I'm livid. Somebody is  just not with the program around here. You know, I'm freaking pissed off. I want to break 
[25:00]
 something. They keep putting the wrong CDs in the CD cases around here. That should be  the easiest thing to do, right? You look at the CD, you see the name on it. This is Margaret  Numero Uno. Numero Uno, Claire. It should be easy to put the CD in the right case. But  no, we got burned twice last week and we just got burned now. At least this time it was  a good Leonard Skinner song. Last week we were supposed to play a Bad Company song or 
[25:30]
 no, a Kenny Wayne Shepard song. We ended up playing a Disco Queen song for two seconds.  We have enough forces that are, you know, fighting against us without our own people  not concentrating and putting the CDs back in the right CD cases. I wonder how that happens.  Is it on purpose? Do you think it's a sabotage? I have some theories, Anthony, but maybe I  should just shut my mouth this time around. I was going to try to just move on with the 
[26:00]
 program but then you just get so pissed off. We have enough problems trying to rebuild  this radio station. We don't need people making dumb mistakes. There you go. Anyway,  where are we? We're all back in order now. Yes, well people are becoming members of the  Tuesday Night Hummer Club as we speak and from time to time, actually we do it every  week, we get some couples that need a little help to get their hummers going. Yeah, this 
[26:30]
 is kind of good too because I think even at this point, Opie and I put our differences  aside as far as the Hummer Club goes and we try to help out. Me, right now, on a voluntary  basis because I am under suspension. Yes. I think Opie has found it in his heart to  put me under house arrest. Yes. So I can still help out. Yeah, we'll see how well you do  the next couple weeks. But if we're going to reinstate you or not. I think I still want  to bring up the tape, Opie. Now, I think I have a right. We just might not have time 
[27:00]
 for the tape today is the problem though, Anthony. I don't think so. If you got this  tape, you'll have your day in court and you'll be able to air it on the air. But I think  there's too much going on our show today to get to your little issue. But like I said,  we will put our differences aside for right now and help people who really need the help.  I mean, my God, we've got to play the gerbil song today, Anthony. I hear the pork guy is  coming in to sing a Christmas song. I think that's the stuff people want to hear today, 
[27:30]
 your little issue with who is the grand poob of the Tuesday night Hummer Club. All right.  Anyway, we got someone standing by here that wants to become a member of the Tuesday night  Hummer Club. Let's go. It's a girl. What? It's Kira. Kira. All right. Well, let's talk  to her because remember the ladies become members of the club as well. It's not just  a male club. You know, the guy getting Hummer and the girl, you know, given they're both 
[28:00]
 members of the club. And I guess she needs some help initiating her husband into the  club. Put her on. N.E.W., what's up? Hi. I like you to call my husband and try to get  him into the Tuesday night Hummer Club. But he leaves work at five. Oh, this is a little  change, huh? Yeah. Well, what is the problem? He doesn't like Hummers? No, he's just kind  of like sex drive a little bit lower than, you know, I'd like. So, trying to initiate 
[28:30]
 things. This is awesome. All right. No, we, we, it's our responsibility. The tides have  changed. What's your name? Kira. And what's his name? Chris. All right, Kira. Let's call  him right now. All right. You'll be able to listen in. So, here we go. Good afternoon.  We speak. Yes, it's Chris. Sure. Hold on a minute. Going well so far? This is Chris.  Hi Chris. This is Opie and Anthony from WNEW Radio. We got you live on the air. Uh oh.  Do you listen to our show? No. Ah. Well, we got a lovely surprise for you today. Okay. 
[29:00]
 We have started a new club on our radio show. Okay. Called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Okay. And that's where we encourage the guys to get Hummers from their wives or girlfriends.  These guys love a Hummer and we think it would make the world a better, happier, less violent  place if everybody was just smiling because they had received Hummers. Would you agree 
[29:30]
 with us? That I can't argue with. Yeah. Okay. Well, believe it or not, your wife told us  to call you because she wants you to become a member of this club tonight. Now, I think  I know what your answer is. That, that, yeah. But would you enjoy a Hummer tonight? Yes.  Yes, that would be a big ole yes. A big ole yes. Well, I think you've got something special  waiting for you when you come home tonight, Chris. From the sound of it, yeah. And I do 
[30:00]
 believe if you do get a Hummer tonight that you're going to have to start listening to  the Opie and Anthony show every day. Yep, yep. I would say so. Yeah, there's nobody  else. Fat Rocky isn't getting you Hummers. You know? Fat Rocky can't even find his  thing yet. What seems to be the problem? Is your sex drive dipping down a little bit?  Oh, well, hey, you know, that, let's just say the Tuesday thing definitely would bring  it back up again. Oh, all right, all right. That's good. See, we like catching these things  and nipping them in the bud because if too many years go by with the sex dropping off 
[30:30]
 in a relationship, sometimes you reach a point of no return. We've talked to some of these  people in relationships where it's just over and never happening again. Never can happen  again, yeah. How long have you been married? Two years. Two years. Well, you guys should  be going at it like rabbits. Yeah, why do you think your sex drive has dropped a bit?  Oh, well, I mean, God only knows. Just too busy with work and everything else? Yeah,  yeah, you know, the day-to-day nonsense. Yeah. All right. What would you like to talk to 
[31:00]
 your wife? I think I'll talk to her when I get home. Hey, Kira, Kira, Kira. Is she  on? Hold on one sec. You gotta at least say hi to her. Okay. Kira. Hello. Say hi to Chris.  Hi, honey. Hello. Hi. You know who you're on the radio with? Yes, I figured it out. 
[31:30]
 I thought I was being taken for a ride there for a minute. So what do you say? Well, that  would be a big old yes. Good. Very good. Does it take much convincing? No. Okay. All right,  well, I should listen to the radio and see what they say. Okay. I'll see you later. I  love you too. Right. Bye. Bye. Look at that. Another happy couple, huh? Have fun tomorrow, 
[32:00]
 Chris. Thank you much. All right. Yeah. And there he goes. See? He's gonna have some fun.  He sure is. Happy guy. The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. Super Tuesday with Neil Young.  This note's for you live and rocking in the free world. It's Opie and Anthony. Don't forget,

It's a concert recorded during  his October tour, which was very, very, very good. All right. We have another couple standing  by that needs help becoming members of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club. We'll get to them  in a little while. All right. Related little note, an email here from Ed in Jersey. Just  got home from work. Had to give you some feedback. I'd like to leave a big F-U to Ray. What a 
[33:00]
 weasel trying to use up your powers of persuasion. Yes, of course. And there are so many out  there in need. Keep up the mission of mercy. Good work. Here, Ray calls us up and says,  here, call my wife and try to get me inducted into the Tuesday Night Hammer Club. Like,  all right, we've done this before. Ask them when the last time he got a hammer was. What  does he say? Oh, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday. We're going to the phones. There are guys  that haven't had hummers in this decade. And Ray wants us to help him out. And he had a 
[33:30]
 hummer on Saturday. Call us for that. Greedy, greedy. That's got to be a serious charity  case. I think we got one standing by. So stick around for that. What else is the feedback  saying? Well, I got to say the number one request coming in over the instant feedback  is the gerbil song. Our new pal, Stephen Lynch from Friday. Yeah, Friday. He did a bunch  of songs for us. My favorite still is the Special Olympics song. But I think the gerbil 
[34:00]
 song comes a close second. Very twisted. Well, I'll be honest. No one told us that we can't  play this song. So I guess we keep playing until they tell us we can't play this one.  Roll tape, people. It'll probably happen right after we play it. Should we call Scott upstairs  and ask him if we could play this song or should we just play it again? Oh, you want  to call him? No. No? What if he says no? Then we look like. Yeah, just play it. Wow, the  phone's going nuts. Everyone's requesting more Stephen Lynch songs. We'll try to get 
[34:30]
 another one on before we get out of here at 7, all right? The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW,  Tom Petty into the great wide open and You're So Bad from Full Moon Fever. It's Opie and  Anthony. Thank you. And we have a very, very busy show happening. Yes, we do. As we speak.  A lot of listeners becoming members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club as we speak. And  we try to help out the people. Yes. That's our mission on Tuesdays. We had a couple on  the air about, what, 35 minutes ago. And we were successful. Yes, we were. Which is great. 
[35:00]
 We've only failed once in our attempt to get people hummers. Yeah. Boy, she was a wreck.  Last week? Yeah. We should replay that. It's terrible. She was so cold you could just feel  the ice in her veins. Yeah. Through the speakers. But we've had more success today. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, we got another case on the line here. All right. Let's see if we can help these  guys out. N.E.W. Yeah, how you doing? My name is Tony, the limo driver. I'm in desperate 
[35:30]
 need of help. I haven't gotten a hummer in about four to five months. Four to five months?  Yeah. What is the problem? My wife just doesn't like doing it. When we were dating she could  suck start a leaf blower. But now, you know. We've got to talk to the ladies today and  get in their heads why all of a sudden after they get married they're just not into it  anymore. Even sex. It's like I have to initiate everything. If it wasn't for me we wouldn't  have sex and she's pregnant. She's four months pregnant. I'm thinking how the hell did she 
[36:00]
 get pregnant? You know, was it a divine intervention? I don't know. But I don't ask this lady for  nothing. You know, I work 12 hours a day. I give her my whole paycheck. I don't ask  for nothing. My birthday is coming up. I said don't give me nothing. All I want is sex.  And you know, it's like I'm asking for a heart transplant. You know, that is the best Christmas  present a lady could give their man this season. That's right. Screw the ties and the stupid 
[36:30]
 things. I don't want anything guys. Guys, I'm easy. I like watching my football and  that's it. Don't bother me. Exactly. So before you got married were you guys just two animals  or? Yeah, she was hot. We used to do it in her house, in her mother's house when her  mother was home sleeping. We'd do it on top of a washing machine in the bathroom. How  long have they been married? I've been married only four years. Oh my God. Do you know what's  going to happen as every year goes by? Guys, I'm going to be 31 this Friday. Even if it 
[37:00]
 was this Tuesday tonight maybe she could do it for my birthday this Friday. This guy sounds  like a good case. Yeah, I mean it's tough. I get home, I leave my house 7.30 in the morning  and come home 9 o'clock at night. And all you want is a little oral satisfaction. That's  right. And you'll sleep better, you'll be happier. You'll even do some chores around  the house probably because it just doesn't matter after that. What's her name? Her name  is Alexandra. The work side of New Jersey. All right, hold on a minute. We're going to 
[37:30]
 give her a call right now. Thank you. We've got to take care of this. Yeah, this sounds  bad. Hello? Yes. Hi, this is Opie and Anthony from NW. Can I help you? Yes, we're calling  you. How are you? Fine. Have you heard about our Tuesday night Hummer Club? No. Well, Anthony,  why don't you explain it to her? Well, you've been married four years now to Anthony? Yes.  And over those four years maybe things, maybe they're a little different than they were 
[38:00]
 when you first got together. Yes. Well, that happens in every marriage. I know. I've been  married for a while now. And there's a certain thing that guys really enjoy that would really  make them happy. And that's why we started this Tuesday night Hummer Club. Geez, I don't  know how to put this. Well, Anthony is wondering if you would give him a Hummer tonight. Hello? 
[38:30]
 Hello? Alex? Hello? Dude, she hung up, man. Oh, man. She hung up. She hung up. Oh, man.  Oh, my God. This is a lot more serious than we first thought. Here's to we have a problem.  Wow. We might have made it even worse for you. My wife laughs, so she has a bit of 
[39:00]
 a temper. You know what the funny thing is, guys? I took her out of the ghetto and this  is what I get. Oh, man. A new house, a new car, a beautiful daughter. Wait a minute.  Should we call her back? Maybe she misunderstood. Maybe if I just tell her to listen to you  guys, maybe she doesn't know I'm there too. All right. All right. Well, dude, we're going  to have to let you fly on this one. Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Let us know what  happens. I'll give you guys a call. All right, man. Bye. There is no way we're calling that 
[39:30]
 lady back. No, no, no. There is no love connection there tonight. She just hung up on us. She  didn't want to acknowledge us. Poor guy. Sometimes we do. It's like a gamble. You take a gamble.  You might get the hummer or you might just make it ten times worse. Yeah, we make it  worse for some couples and we could make dreams happen as well. All right, Anthony. We've  got to talk about take pause real fast here. Uh-oh, Christmas coming up. What do you do, 
[40:00]
 Albie? Well, you look for something different and special. And I think take pause might  be your ticket if you've got someone special in your life. I think you're right. There's  a bunch of cute jungle animals. That's what they are. We've seen them. They look great.  They're well made. And I think anybody would love getting one of these. You feel loved.  Yes. Well, they're tigers. They've got the white Bengal tiger. They've got the leopard. 
[40:30]
 They've got the panther, lion or Siberian tiger. And they're collectibles just like  the beanie babies and hummels and stuff like that. Other family members will follow once  this first generation is retired. So they're going to retire it, which will make it more  valuable for you. And they're very cool. Anthony brought one home to his wife, Jennifer, and  she absolutely loved it. Oh, she does? You figured she would probably throw it in the  corner with the rest of her stuffed animals, maybe appreciate it for a couple hours and  then just kind of throw it aside, right? Yeah. But this one, it's really lifelike. 
[41:00]
 It looks at you. Its eyes kind of follow you around. It's got real life eyes. It scares  the hell out of our cats. Really? Yeah. One of our cats walks up to it and like taps it  on the nose. Like, it runs away. That's pretty cool. And you don't have to take our word  for it. If you're on line right now, you can go to their website and check out some pictures  of the Take Paws pets. Their website is www.takepawswithaz.com. 1027W on EW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday 
[41:30]
 with Live. That's pain lies on the riverside from mental jewelry and lightning crashes  before that. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey, on the way we're going to be doing another episode,  I guess, of the Furby Police, Anthony. Furby Police. We have a lot of people selling Furbies,  those cuddly little pieces of crap that people are paying upwards of three, five hundred  bucks a clip for, for a kid's toy that costs $29.95. Yeah, so people are selling these 
[42:00]
 in the newspaper. And we give them hell. We call up their number and give them the hell  that they so rightly deserve. Yes, and Dan sent an email. It says, call these dickheads  and give them some ass. And it's an ad for Furbies. Furbies, only a few left, unopened  in box, three to five hundred dollars each called Blah, Blah, Blah in Jersey. Huh. All  right. We'll do that one next. All right. And we're going to play another song from 
[42:30]
 Stephen Lynch in a little while. Good. Which one? The little, the lullaby that he's sung  to his little daughter after his wife left him. Oh, very touching song. Very touching  song. That's a great song to crank out tonight. Huh? Yeah. As we get new members to the Tuesday  Night Hammer Club. It's stupid Tuesday with Van Halen, Ice Cream Man and Where Have All  the Good Times Gone. Both songs are very appropriate for a lot of couples out there. Thus, the 
[43:00]
 Tuesday Night Hammer Club. Anthony? Yes. How many new members you think we're initiating  as we do our program today? You know, I can't even imagine. I don't know. It's got to be  thousands. You think we're going to get thousands of new members this week? I think so. Very  cool. Very cool. I like hearing from you guys as you're getting on the highway on the way  home. Thanks for that. We appreciate it. What is up with that? I don't know. Dangerous. I  mean, we're happy for you, but I just don't want to hear the guys. Well, yeah, you can 
[43:30]
 figure it out. Yeah. I'd rather hear the girl. But okay. All right. Anyway, on the way we  get the Furby police. We've been calling this guy, but so far we're getting a machine.  That's why we'll keep trying, obviously. Yeah. We've got to get these people. Yeah, because  this guy is just selling Furbys like they're going out of style. Got an ad here from someone  that Dan sent it in to us. They're just selling them for between $300 and $500 each for a 
[44:00]
 Come on. They only have a few left. They're in unopened boxes. Call now. Some guy in Jersey.  So we'll do that in a little bit. Okay. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Two for Tuesday  with Pearl Jam Immortality from Vitalogy, an elderly woman behind the counter in a small  town. My personal favorite. Anthony. Yeah, I know that. I say it every time we play it.  All right. There's a bunch of people on hold that are becoming members of the club as we 
[44:30]
 speak. It's great. We know it. It's just the way it is. People love it. They love the Tuesday  Night Hummer Club. Let's talk to one of these guys. IAW. Hey, I joined the club. Congratulations.  Hey, you know, last couple weeks ago, there was only a partial member tonight. Full-bore  and you know what I mean. When did it go down? So it's about an hour ago. Right on. You guys 
[45:00]
 are dynamite. Love listening to you. You were listening to our show when it was going down?  Yeah, sure was. God, what were we talking about? Or what song were we playing? I don't remember  now. I was busy concentrating on other things. Good boy. Good boy. Thanks a lot. Take it  easy. Congratulations. Thanks. Bye. Look how happy that guy is. I know. Amazing. It's  only Tuesday. It's only Tuesday and now he's got the rest of the week to look forward to.  He's very happy and content. He had a Friday attitude right there. Yeah. You know? Yeah. 
[45:30]
 Believable. And there's about ten others on hold just waiting to talk to us, to bow to  us. Because I'm assuming if we get you guys hummers that you've got to become faithful  listeners of our show after that. We need a little payback here. I mean, that's why  we're trying this stuff, you know? You're not getting fat rocky. You won't get hummers  over there. No, you won't. It ain't happening. No. Homo Urban Station that just changed over?  Yeah. That ain't going to get you hummers. No. Mike and the Mad Dog, they're too busy 
[46:00]
 talking about the NBA strike. They're not going to get you hummers. They're still taking  calls over there on the fan. We took it at Jets touchdown. Oh, Mike, I don't think that  was a touchdown. Yeah, you're right. I think he was short of that and the replay showed  that. Yeah, thanks, man. Hanger on the air. Hey, is this Mike and the Mad Dog? Mike and  the Mad Dog? Yeah, what can I do for you? Boy, I want to get off the subject a little 
[46:30]
 bit. Talk about something completely different. Okay. Man, I don't think that was a touchdown  at Jets game, huh? Well, I think they need to bring the replay back, huh? Yeah, I think  maybe they've got to bring that replay back. You know, you get that over there. Yeah. And  here we're getting you hummers. We're getting you hummers, for God's sake. That's pretty  amazing if you think about it. What else do we have to do? Right. That is pretty amazing. 
[47:00]
 Yeah, well, just trying to make you happy. If you look at your options on the dial, I  think this is the place to be on Tuesdays at least. Yeah. We better come up with a theme  every day of the week and we'll be all set, I think. All right, do we have time to try  this guy selling the Furbies again? Yeah, this guy just deserves some pounding. Yes,  I want to thank Dan. I shouldn't give his last name. Of Park Ridge, New Jersey, he found  an ad and this reads here, call these dickheads and give them some ass. Furbies for sale, 
[47:30]
 only a few left, unopened, in a box, three to five hundred dollars each. Come on. Call  blah blah at blah blah. It gives the name of the guy, his first and last name and everything.  We obviously got to mess with this guy a bit here. Of course. What angle do you want to  take? Will Opie, I might be representing the toy company. Really? Yes. Who are you? I'm  an attorney. Let's just leave it at that. You're an attorney? Yes. All right, let's 
[48:00]
 give this guy a call and mess with him a little bit. It's the Furby police, everyone.  Hello, is this the ****ville residence? Yes, it is. You have an ad in the newspaper. Right.  My name is Barry Levin. I'm an attorney for Hasbro Toys. Right. What are you selling these  for? How much, sir? At this point, we haven't made a price yet. Well, we've done a few preliminary  calls and you are charging an exorbitant amount of money for these toys. Do you know this 
[48:30]
 is illegal, sir? I thought as of last year, it wasn't illegal. Well, it is very illegal.  Now, how much have you made selling these, sir? As of right now, nothing. That is not  the information I have. I have that, Mr. ****ville, I have that you have made quite a few dollars  off of these toys. Well, I don't know where you got that information from. Believe me,  this is a serious matter. I wouldn't start laughing. I'm not laughing, sir. You're a  394 **** Avenue? Yes. Okay, how do you feel we should resolve this, sir? You tell me. 
[49:00]
 You're an attorney. I'm trying to... Listen to me. I am listening. Buddy, I'm trying to  make it easy for you, sir. Okay. I'm trying to make it easy for you. You be honest with  me. You know, as of last year, the law says you could spend up to 15 years in prison for  this, sir. No, I didn't. Do you know that, sir? I just told you that as of last year,  from what I heard, that it wasn't illegal. Now, you tell me how much you've made from  these. I told you, as of right now, nothing. You're lying. Now, why would I lie to you,  sir? To stay out of trouble, probably. No, if I'm trying to stay out of trouble, I'm 
[49:30]
 telling you what I know. I told you I haven't sold any as of yet. Mr. **** Bill, how many  do you have in your possession right now? Ten. Ten? Well, actually, less than ten. Well,  what is it? Ten, five? You know, anything more than ten, you could get 30 years in prison.  And people in prison don't take too kindly to people selling children's toys for large  amounts of money, sir. Now, how many do you have? I'm trying to get two more, and I have  one, two, three. Like five. And I'm trying to buy five. I was going to buy five for someone 
[50:00]
 else. Where did you get these, sir? At a toy store. At a toy store. Yes. Is there a park  nearby your house, sir? A park? A park that maybe we can meet at and settle this like  gentlemen? How would that be? You say you have ten of these left? No, I have five. I'm  trying to buy five. You have five left. Five for 75 each or for someone else. 75 each.  So you're going to be selling them for a lot more than that, I take it. No, I told you,  if I was going to sell them, I would try and get like 125. 125. Yes. All right, I'll tell 
[50:30]
 you what. What's the name of the park near your house? Um, **** Park. All right, here's  the deal. Meet me at **** Park in two hours. Bring the five remaining Furby dolls, give  them to me, end a **** job, and I'll let you go. You keep dreaming. I'm serious, Mr. ****  Bill. I'm serious with you too, sir. You know, this is a crime. Five years in prison or ****  me. Do you know that I have you on tape, sir? Five years in prison or **** me. I have you  on tape, sir. Wow. He was stuttering there for a little while. I like the choice of music 
[51:00]
 for the Furby police. How did Charlie's Angels get on it? I don't know, but. I'm thinking  of Joe's Angels. There are Furby's. Yeah, I'm thinking of big cans. I have to share  a land, the underwater scene. Oh, nice pair of Furby's started out with SWAT, went into 
[51:30]
 the rookies and ended with Charlie's Angels. There you have it. The Furby police and the  Hopi and Anthony show Anthony cigars around the world.

He was  the winner of the Joe Perry Private Guitar Lesson and the Gibson guitar during the Aerosmith 
[54:00]
 Tic-A-Blitz weekend we did this past weekend. And this coming weekend we got Family Four  Packs to see Roger Daltrey in a Christmas Carol at the theater at Madison Square Garden.  That's going to be cool. Roger D. Did you see that last year at the Christmas Carol?  No. No, you saw, oh never mind, you saw Tommy. Yeah, that was, was that last year? Yeah.  No, no, Tommy was a few years ago. I saw that. And then Quadrophenia. No, well, wait. I went  around and did. Which one was with Billy Idol, Tommy? Quadrophenia. Quadrophenia? Yeah. 
[54:30]
 Okay. And what did Billy Idol play in that? Oh, you know, he was the punky guy. Yeah,  okay. And who else was in it? That, that, who's the guy? Hey, Gary Glitter. Gary Glitter.  Yeah. Right before he got arrested for Kitty Point. Yeah, lovely. Oh, the Bell Boy. Yeah,  that was it. Thanks, Carol. Appreciate it. Billy Idol. Bell Boy. Yeah. Jesus. Right 
[55:00]
 in the mouth. I think that was so important for our show. Thanks, Carol. Couldn't do it  without you. She's just trying to help open. I understand that. We love Carol now. Right,  Carol? Okay, great. All right, where were we? Oh, now I'm supposed to find out where  we were. I know that the phone lines are very busy. See, now she has to come in. I'll tell  you how much I love you. I'm not even putting a mic on for you, so you better shout. Don't 
[55:30]
 put a mic on. I love you guys. I said we love you now. I'm cool. Okay. Aren't you happy  I didn't resign? Oh, no comment. I said I like you, but I'm not going there. No, no,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You do sound great on the air, Carol. Okay, bye-bye. All  right. At least you don't play solitaire during your show like other jocks around here. I'm  waiting to say that for two hours because someone screwed up our music earlier. You 
[56:00]
 might have been listening. Okay, great. That was way too inside for the listeners. All  right. Oh, we got this lady standing by. She's got a solution for the ladies out there that  may be too busy to give their man a hummer. All right. She's got some kind of wacky scheme.  Okay, let's listen. Let's take a listen. Hi, Andy W. Hi. Hi. I have a solution for that 
[56:30]
 evil woman you spoke to last week. Okay. I did this two years ago with my boyfriend.  It's a schedule of Hummer Points. For all the help he gives me around the house, he  earns Hummer Points. Twenty Hummer Points were he can transfer in for a Hummer. Wow,  that is cool. Let's see. What is the point system? Give us some examples. Washington  dishes was one Hummer Point per item washed. Vacuuming was five points. Dinner meal preparation 
[57:00]
 was for a full dinner was fifteen points. Burgers was eight points. If he called for  delivery he got one point. If he paid for it he got five. Points must be earned and  presented prior to receiving any portion of a Hummer. No credit will be given under any  circumstances. Hummer Points may be redeemed Monday through Friday, 9 to 11. Saturday,  Sunday and holiday hours will be determined on a per day basis in conjunction with planned  activities and the whereabouts of the Hum givers children. Hummer Points are not transferrable 
[57:30]
 except to my close friends and can be redeemed only by an experienced Hum giver. Do not try  and redeem these points with an amateur no matter how tempting it may seem. Fraudulent  redemption may result in extreme damage to the Hummy's personal property. Now I did this  two years ago. It worked great. He worked his butt off. He was a happy man. The girl  who had too much to do, and that's what she had two jobs. She had kids. She was helping  with the homework last week. Just what it worked. Of course it would have. And then 
[58:00]
 you have little tickets that have one Hummer Point per and five Hummer Points and you hand  them to him when he does his stuff. When he collects his twenty he turns them in. Now  how many Hummers was he getting a month? My house was so clean. You have no clue. And  his pipes were very clean. It was a wonderful thing. It really was. This is bribery. I'm  not going to lie. I like it a lot. Oh my God. The grand poohva likes this. I would settle  for this in a second. You're being manipulated by this. No way. I'm on your side this time. 
[58:30]
 You better explain it to the people. I work full time. The spirit of the Tuesday night  Hummer Club has nothing to do with working for it. I bet you if we took a poll right  now. Wait, wait, wait. I bet you if we took a poll right now there are guys that would  go for this idea in a second. All they had to do was vacuum four times a week. Oh my  God. Vacuum four times a week. Wait, wait, wait. There's your poohva selling you down  the road. Wait a minute. The poohva is selling you out guys. If I was guaranteed to get a 
[59:00]
 Hummer every time I collected twenty points just doing stupid chores around the house  I would easily go for that. Not the spirit of the Hummer Club which is just to please  get a Hummer. Now we're into housework and chores. No, no, no. We're into a solution.  Point systems. This is exactly how things stop happening in a relationship. We've got  to start somewhere though. Because all the guys who are calling are saying the wives  work. They've got this. They're too tired. They're too this. Hey, keep them from getting  tired. The man helps out. Oh, he loves it. Great. There's your poohva. Now go put on 
[59:30]
 your apron guys and vacuum and do the dishes to earn your Hummer. Amen. That's great. I  think you're onto something. If you were going to get a woman to follow you around  on her knees while you're doing this you wouldn't be doing it. Great. There you go. Well thank  you. Take a survey. All right. Okay. Bye guys. Wonderful. Great, great. Good. So you know  what happens after time? The guy doesn't do the work and the girl doesn't give the Hummers.  And what do you have? Marriage. We have the exact problem. We're trying a remedy with 
[60:00]
 that. Oh, you're a poohva people. I just agreed with and thought it was a great idea. What  other great ideas do you have up your sleeve? Poova. Well, I am the acting grand poohva  because I finally became a member last week Anthony. Man, screwing it up pretty quick.  I'll be honest. It's not fun being the grand poohva of this club. There's too much pressure.  But when you come up with dopey ideas like that and I have a tape that proves that it 
[60:30]
 was opi's idea for the three month limit on the Hummer club on the three month membership  expiration. Meaning you only had to get a Hummer every three months? That wasn't the  essence of it. But you turned around and said that that's what I said. Meanwhile, I have  a tape in my possession that has opi saying that there should be a three month limit.  It was opi's idea. And now he puts this girl on the air that's talking about point systems 
[61:00]
 and work. Yeah guys, great. What is he? A guy's got to be like Paul Ingalls out in the  field or turning butter before he can get a Hummer now? Now Anthony, where is this so-called  tape? I have it. Where? Right in my bag. And I've made other copies. I put one in my safety  deposit box that if anything should happen to me, it's to be played. And this will show  that I am guilty of suggesting that memberships run out if you don't get a Hummer every three 
[61:30]
 months. Yes. There's your pooh bah. This tape right here? Yes it is. What I need you guys  to do is explain to my husband on the air that he doesn't have to bring in his membership  every week. Well, the rule states that once you're in, you're in. But honestly, I think  there should be an expiration date on... Oh no, no, no, no, no. Here you go. Let the tape  come out. No, where'd you get that tape? Truth, let the truth come out. No, no, no, no. Look 
[62:00]
 at you. I don't know what you're talking about. There's your pooh bah people. He doesn't even  want the truth to come out. You were the one who suggested the three month rule. Nope. Meaning  guys only get it once every three months. I have the tape. If you let the tape play,  you will see that you suggested it. Look at the time. We've got to go. We've got to go.  Fine. I think enough information has gone out that the people can make up their own  minds and realize that their pooh bah, opi, Mr. One Week, I Got a Hummer, whatever. One 
[62:30]
 week I got a hummer, whatever. What the hell am I saying? Listen, man, Rick destroyed this  tape. I don't care. I have more. I have plenty. I'm not falling for that one again where Rick  smashes it. Your puppet over there. A puppet for the corporation. Well, we obviously don't  have time to play this tape, so I guess we'll have to play it on a future Opi and Anthony  show. I'm in no rush. The truth will come out. They've heard enough already, Mr. Do  Your Chores for a Hummer. Come on, guys. Earn those points. Was that ever what it was about? 
[63:00]
 Can I end the show as the grand pooh bah by congratulating all the new members of the  Tuesday Night Hummer Club? You make me sick. We'll congratulate the people that will become  members later on tonight as well. Okay. All right. This so-called tape, I guess we could  let it ride on a future episode of the Opi and Anthony show. Right here in my bag. All  right. We'll see you tomorrow at 3. Is it true that the pork man is coming in tomorrow  to sing Christmas songs? Yeah, that's what I hear. Pork delivery guy. The guy that throws 
[63:30]
 the menus under your door and drives the bicycle.
