 Wow, you're angry.  Let's rock and roll and get it out in the open.  F Christmas shopping.  It sucks.  It does.  F driving around Manhattan.  Yeah.  Ugh.  People shopping, walking in the middle.  People are darting out in front of cars.  Because everyone has lost their mind, Anthony.  Everyone has lost their mind in this stupid holiday season.  You know what it comes down to?  It comes down to people coming into Manhattan.  I think a lot of people working in the city, you know, people work here and they're here 
[00:30]
 to shop and they step out from behind trucks and buses from in front of them and go right  into traffic.  And you've got to jam on the brakes and then they put that look on their face.  Oh no, oh no.  I almost hit them.  And they don't even look at what.  It's indecent roads, people.  Because they're zombies.  Most people are zombies this time of year.  They're just going from store to store.  What am I going to get grandma this year?  Grandma.  Get out of the road. 
[01:00]
 What am I going to get my wife this year?  Then traffic.  Sometimes you become the, now I got a cross in front of you guy because you're in the  crosswalk.  Well, Giuliani's got everyone so scared that if you do end up in the intersection and a  little space opens up in front of you, you've got to take it.  Even if you're right in the middle of the crosswalk.  Right.  And then people walk by.  Why, you mother.  Because you're the guy in the crosswalk.  I'm the guy in the guy in the crosswalk. 
[01:30]
 I'm the a-hole.  Thank you.  Bang on my hood on the hood of my car.  Yes, I deserve it.  That's me.  Oh, I see they're going behind me.  Oh, that's oh no, no, that key will work great on my trunk.  Go ahead.  Just key it.  No, I didn't need that rear wiper.  That's OK.  Thank you.  I didn't need my side view.  I have your mirror.  Which I actually lost in traffic.  What a month ago that happened.  Yeah.  Someone punched Opie's side view mirror.  Why didn't we ever talk about that on the air?  It happened a month ago.  I don't know. 
[02:00]
 You were being a little aggressive one night.  And I still haven't fixed the damn thing.  Some guy was in the crosswalk when the light turned green.  And he's just taking his sweet ass time.  So Opie gives a little boom on the gas pedal.  I start inching up.  I want to go.  You bumped his hip with your bumper.  That's what you say.  I know you did.  He went like, hey.  And then he wham, he punched the side view mirror.  He just took it out.  He didn't just punch it.  He took it out.  I thought he shattered the whole side window.  Now he just bashed your mirror. 
[02:30]
 So then you're sitting there like, all right.  Do you just count your losses and move on?  Or do you get out of your car, make a scene, hope he doesn't have a gun?  The light was green.  You had to go.  Yeah, I had to go.  So I'm the guy, if you want to know what I drive, I'm the guy driving around with my  side view mirror just hanging, flopping over the side view mirror.  Flopping, banging into my car because I haven't fixed it in a month.  F him too.  F the world.  F the world.  Had it.  All right.  Facts line, get your FUs in.  212-957-WNW.  You know, we're gaining new listeners on a weekly basis. 
[03:00]
 So Anthony, why don't you quickly explain what FU Friday is all about really fast?  Because maybe people just don't get it.  Right.  It's your opportunity out there to vent your anger.  It's Friday.  A lot of anger being piled up in you from this Christmas shopping, work, whatever.  You're pissed off at your boss.  You're a person you're in a relationship with.  This is your forum.  You usually don't have any place to vent your beef.  Yes.  Call us up, fax us, email us, instant feedback, email us, and we will get your complaints 
[03:30]
 on the air.  All right.  A really big FU to you guys in NW for never playing Allison Chains.  I listen every day at different times and I've never heard one song.  Why is that?  They are a great band.  Was that written by me?  I know.  They're our favorite band.  We played Allison Chains in the past.  Let me tell you.  And we better start playing a little more because I think the band fits here at NW.  It's my favorite band, Allison Chains.  And this guy writes, last time I faxed about this, Anthony Wine, we play Allison Chains. 
[04:00]
 When did I say that?  I don't know.  This guy has been faxing a lot about that and you supposedly told him, we do play Allison  Chains.  We do.  Just not a lot.  So, all right.  I love that band.  I know.  It's obvious.  Okay.  We're ready to rock.  Yeah.  You know, when someone has a legitimate bitch about us, whatever.  Fine.  We read it.  Whatever.  Listen to this guy. 
[04:30]
 Dopey and Anthony.  You got us.  We've never been called that one before.  Maybe you should wake up and realize you're in New York City.  The traffic and people have been acting the same for the last hundred years here.  I guess it just takes retards longer to get the idea.  Frank.  Frank.  We're from New York.  I think we know how New York works.  You mean to say that the holiday traffic and people is exactly the same as any other time 
[05:00]
 of the year?  You jerk off?  What are you?  You're the retard.  The idiot.  Go out there today.  Go out there this weekend.  Go to Rockefeller Center.  You tell me it's exactly like it is every other day of the year.  You asshole.  Frank.  Here's a guy bitching and he's talking out his ass.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  Frank, you moron.  Go to Rockefeller Center right now. 
[05:30]
 Go by the Christmas tree.  Tell me driving there is just like it is during any other time of the year.  What a dopey asshole.  There.  I got to fuck my peace.  That pissed me off that fact.  I think Anthony's going to lose his ass today.  I like that.  Well when people have legitimate complaints it's like, oh jeez we screwed up there, okay.  You got to take it.  And we'll take it.  Yeah.  The other day I said Eli Wallach was dead and I caught hell because it was E.G. Marshall. 
[06:00]
 All right, I agree.  I screwed up.  But that one, Frank?  Frank, you're an idiot.  1027W, N.A.W.  The Rock of New York, AC, D.C.  It's a long way to the top.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Music is sounding good.  Everyone is psyched.  The end of the week is upon us.  And we got some high energy going here for you.  So keep the facts coming in for FU Friday.  212-957W, N.A.W.  Getting a bunch of sports FUs coming in. 
[06:30]
 This one's from Chris.  I want to send a huge FU out to the Miami Dolphins and all their fans.  Let's go Jets.  Huge game this weekend for the Jets.  They can get a division title.  Yeah.  They beat the Dolphins.  They're looking very, very good.  Giants playing the Broncos.  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  Do you think the Giants are going to be the team to knock off the Broncos?  Yeah, yeah.  It's definitely going to be the Giants.  You never know.  It's a goof factor though.  Yeah, but it would take a big goof factor.  If I was a betting man, I would bet that the Giants will definitely cover the spread this 
[07:00]
 weekend.  I think it's going to be a very good game.  I'm totally serious.  I know it sounds crazy.  I'll take the bet.  How much do you want to bet?  I don't know.  What's the line on the Giants game?  Anyone have it?  How much do you want to bet?  I'll bet you right now.  I will find it.  Ben's looking it up.  I'll bet you a hundred.  A hundred?  A hundred.  All right.  I'll go for the hundred.  A hundred that the Giants cover the spread.  Yeah. 
[07:30]
 I want to be real ballsy and say that they're going to beat them.  Stop.  You're just talking like a crazy man.  Twelve and a half.  Twelve and a half.  Twelve and a half.  You know something?  I'll take it.  Yeah.  Okay.  A hundred dollars.  You're going to lose.  A hundred dollars.  The Giants will cover the spread.  I've got to make up for my Zoom.com stock I bought.  You're so stupid.  Every other internet stock goes through the roof.  I buy Zoom.com.  It's like in the toilet.  I know it is. 
[08:00]
 What the hell is going on?  You got it at what?  Thirty-eight?  I'm like the guy that got in on the pyramid scam when it broke up.  Everybody else is like,  I just made like twenty grand on the pyramid thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to meet at this meeting place and we'll get you a thousand dollars.  All right.  This sounds great.  I'm going to make twenty grand.  I'm going to write me a check real quick.  Like a week later.  What did you hear, man?  Yeah.  The pyramid collapsed.  It did?  All right. 
[08:30]
 Where's my money?  Oh, no.  You don't get your money.  Oh, no.  Vinny's got your money.  Okay.  This is good.  It's all over.  Internet stock.  This is going to go up to 150, 200 a share, I bet you.  Like Amazon.com and every other A-hole.com.  Anthony, you haven't answered my question though.  You bought it at 38, right?  Yeah.  Two days ago?  Yeah.  All right.  What is it down to today?  Twenty-four.  Twenty-four, OP.  Way to go.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  I'm looking at a tax write-off, I think. 
[09:00]
 I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank. 
[09:30]
 I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.

I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  I'm going to go to the bank.  He's sick.  He's better.  He's sick again.  He's better.  He's in a coma.  He's not in a coma.  He's sitting up.  He's hitting baseballs.  He's back in a coma.  You know what?  You know what?  I feel bad for Joe.  Why doesn't the old bastard die already? 
[10:00]
 He's a MetFan.  It's like everybody else.  I feel pretty bad for Joe, but think of it this way.  Get him off the damn respirator.  He's probably hovering in that death, life phase where one minute he's the old guy  wheezing.  He can't breathe.  He's ready to die.  The next minute he's looking at the light and there's Marilyn with a skirt blowing  up going, Joe, come here, Joe.  He's like, what did I pull the plug already? 
[10:30]
 For God's sake, pull the plug.  Joe, hurry.  Jack's coming.  Yeah, and then he's kept alive and he looks at himself.  He looks like the Crip Keeper.  Yeah, then he's the old guy again.  Oh, I'm back.  Oh, no.  Come on, Eddie.  Just pull the plug.  Marilyn's waiting.  It's not like all of a sudden it's going to be, oh, he's better.  Well, look, the Yankees just signed him again.  Let the guy go with some dignity.  Of course.  It's tragic.  Every news organization has a play-by-play that, oh, the Clipper's thrown another curve 
[11:00]
 in the hospital.  That's what the Post said today.  Yeah, they got it.  Joe DiMaggio threw a curveball last night.  It's like a rallying in the late innings.  Yeah, all the doctors have their rally caps on.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  Come on, Jolton Joe.  Let Jolton Joe go, for God's sake.  He's got Marilyn waiting for him.  Yeah, Marilyn's not going to wait for her too long.  She's got a couple of Kennedys to hang with. 
[11:30]
 Yeah, but Joe's not coming.  All right, on the way.  That's horrible.  Oh, my God.  I thought I was just hacking into him.  I don't know what to do.  Huh?  Anthony, Cigar's Around the World.  What?  Huh?  What?  When did you get into broadcasting?  What?  Mics on, talking over commercials.  Excuse me, you're the button guy.  All right.  You turn it off when I'm talking.  You turn it.  See? 
[12:00]
 You're a jackass.  All right, Cigar's Around the World, Anthony, the original Cigar of the Month Club.  What are you going to do, go out in the malls shopping?  Hmm?  You can do this right from your house.  You've got a cigar aficionado in your life.  Give them a subscription to Cigar's Around the World.  Yeah, you can totally take care of them, man.  It's really easy.  For only $24.95 per month plus shipping, Cigar's Around the World sends five fresh hand-rolled  cigars, a smokey newsletter, free cigar cutter, gift card, and more.  And they've got all sorts of plans, too.  You can get a two to 12-month membership.  You can do this by calling 1-800-Fresh-66. 
[12:30]
 1-800-Fresh-66.  They also have a website.  That's www.Cigar'sAroundTheWorld.com.  Got it?  Got it.  1027W, honey, W, the ride of New York Van, hailing little guitars.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  She's all worried that I lost all my money on Zoom.com.  No.  I was only using risk capital, which to me amounts to about $10.38.  Yeah, everyone is coming down and panicking and hoping you're going to be okay, Anthony. 
[13:00]
 That's all right.  I'm riding it out.  I'm into Zoom for the long-term, Opie.  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah, I'm going to come back.  I saw you in the office panicking, trying to figure out how to get out of this one alive.  If you weren't listening a little while ago, Anthony got in on an IPO.  No, no, I got in after the IPO.  After the IPO.  Yeah.  That was the problem, right?  Well, this, the internet stocks are great.  I mean, they're shooting up over $100.  Except Zoom.com. 
[13:30]
 So Anthony gets in two days ago at $38 and it's now $28 two days later.  No, no, no, no.  Let's check the latest thing.  All right, I think the market is closing.  Let's see how much you lost today.  All right, we're at $26.25.  All right.  You lost 12 points in two days.  Wow.  Yeah, that stock is zooming okay, Anthony.  Oh, well, that's okay.  Whole life savings, but that's okay.  Come back. 
[14:00]
 All right.  The facts is coming in like crazy.  Two one two nine five seven W.  N. E. W.  It is F. U.  Friday.  Oh, beat Anthony.  I want to say F.U.  To all the Philadelphia Flyers and their stupid fans.  Devils with an awesome comeback last night in their rake.  F.U.  Lindros.  That's from Jersey Girl.  This one's pretty funny.  F.U.  To my wife for not taking a hint.  I wanted to surprise her for Christmas by getting her remote starter for her Maxam.  Maximum, which I pay for. 
[14:30]
 So I took the car to work to drop off for the installation.  She's been calling all F&A asking when her car will be home and why did I take it?  Oh, by the way, I left my 1996 Explorer at home for her to use.  I'm pissed off.  That's from Steve.  Wow.  And then we got a I don't even know how we even talk about the other facts we got.  Oh, you got it?  I don't know what to do with this.  I don't know whether we should sit on this or we might have to sit on it for a few minutes. 
[15:00]
 Check with a couple of people.  That's not our style.  I don't think we're going to check with anyone.  We just want to tease it.  We got a F.U. from a ex-employee's wife.  Look at Roger.  No, he's shaking his head.  No.  He's walking out of the studio.  He doesn't want to be a part of it.  Hey, we had nothing to do with it.  Yeah. 
[15:30]
 Now we better read it before they tell us we can't read it.  This is just, it's everybody's forum here.  We open the airwaves to anybody who has a bitch about anything.  Yes.  Okay.  And this girl obviously has a few issues that she wants to sort out.  And why shouldn't we open up the airwaves to her?  Yeah.  I think it would be a bias on our part if we didn't get everybody's little crank out  there.  Well, we sure can't pick and choose at this point. 
[16:00]
 No.  All right.  Dear Opry and Anthony, I have a big F.U. shout out for WNEW alumni Dave Herman.  Uh-oh.  I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but we're in the process of getting a divorce.  He was one, he has one place to restrain order on me because he thought I would spousely  abuse him.  Now these are all Libby's allegations.  Yes.  Two, underhandedly took custody of my two children.  I got them back.  And three, he is not paying child support. 
[16:30]
 Now these are Libby's allegations.  We are just reading them verbatim from her facts.  I understand if you have reservations about shouting out this particular F.U., not very  PC perhaps, maybe as a public service you can give my garage sale a plug, see a task,  whatever.  Good morning to you guys.  Good luck there.  Libby, Libby Herman.  See a task.  Oh no.  It's another fact that says Dave Herman sellout sale. 
[17:00]
 Holy cow.  He's selling his stuff.  Rock and roll radio fans may have heard that radio legend Dave Herman was recently fired  from his job as morning man at N.E.W.  Let his loss be your gain.  Oh no.  This is awful.  In order to make ends meet, I will be having a giant blowout garage sale.  Some items include rock and roll memorabilia, signed items from some of your favorite classic  artists, even some of Dave's clothes, including his trademark hats. 
[17:30]
 This is just ruthless.  Yes, you can own a piece of rock and roll history and then it just lists all the items  and furniture and all sorts of stuff.  And there's a phone number here.  You got Libby on the line?  Oh man.  Libby.  Hey.  What's going on?  How you doing?  You really want to know?  Yeah.  We got your facts.  Hello?  Yeah.  Well, that's what's going on.  Not a happy place over here lately.  What happened?  God, I don't even know where to start.  So what happened? 
[18:00]
 Well, should I really get into it?  Yeah, go for it.  It started about three years ago.  No.  This is a very good question.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, people grow apart and they're having differences.  Sammy is standing right here, so this is going to be hard to talk to you.  But anyway, we were having some differences that, you know, I didn't think we could stick.  And I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[18:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[19:00]
 It's 13 years.  You know, I know that's my wife.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't read.  Maybe 40 years ago, 
[19:30]
 Not that I was going to abuse him or something.  I was going to attack him.  I don't know.  I swear to God it blew me away.  Did you ever beat him up?  I don't know.  I'm going to take the fifth on that.  Did I ever beat him up?  Who's married?  I forget who's married.  Anthony's married.  Has your wife ever gotten so PO'd at you that she karate chopped you or something?  Please say yes.  No, no, we're not a hitting couple. 
[20:00]
 No, no.  When he had argumented me to my face and I kind of went back, I did like a, you know,  one of those.  Well, you could break his hip and do that.  You hit him too hard.  I don't know my own strength.  You'll have to hit his life-call pendant.  I have been power-walking and working out.  I don't know.  So he's got the restraining order against you.  He did.  And what else is he doing here?  Well, I guess in all fairness, I should tell you what I did too.  Okay. 
[20:30]
 I locked him out of the house.  So maybe he had reasons to think I was a little over the top.  If you tell me you're dating Scott Muni, I'm going to kill myself.  So now he's not paying the child support, huh?  Well, when he feels like it.  When he feels like it.  I'm a lawyer thing, I guess.  You know, my lawyer calls his lawyer and then his lawyer doesn't answer the phone.  Wow. 
[21:00]
 And you know, what's up?  So how was sex with Dave?  I don't know.  I'm going to play it the fifth time.  Uh-oh.  Did he need the Viagra or was he okay?  What?  What?  I'm just asking.  He had some motion in that ocean still.  Yeah, he wasn't all bad.  Wasn't all good.  It was just kind of there?  Yeah.  We were together for 15 years.  The best period of my life. 
[21:30]
 So Libby, are you getting any action now?  You know, I'm too involved with garage sales and stuff.  Yeah, is it true you're selling half his stuff?  Well, yeah.  Why not?  Well, he did approve a lot of it.  How long has he been in the business?  Like 30 years?  Something like that.  So we have unbelievable, you know, like tchotchkes.  Oh no.  We have your tchotchkes.  He's selling Dave's stuff.  We've got Bruce's juice, you know, cartons. 
[22:00]
 We've got, what don't we have?  We have Devo hats.  We have...  It's like the Hunger-thon, only Libby's getting the cash.  Yeah, you know, going through this closet going, holy moly, you know?  Oh man.  It's been sitting in this closet and so I think it's time.  We always thought it would be valuable someday.  Oh, this is brutal.  We have a Smurf collection that you wouldn't believe.  I'm hesitating whether I want to hold on to it or not. 
[22:30]
 You know, Smurfs will come back someday.  Don't you think?  Oh yeah, of course they will.  Just like his radio career.  He's selling his clothes?  I didn't say that.  You're selling some of his clothes?  Yeah, you know, some clothes, some t-shirts, a nice dinner jacket.  Oh, this is ugly.  How about those hats?  I have his number one legend hat.  I have a sweaty N.E.W. hat.  I have a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame hat. 
[23:00]
 He is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  So this is valuable stuff.  This is a real public service here.  I'm not kidding, I'm really doing this.  All right, so if there's some Dave Herman fans out there and they want to own a piece  of Dave, what should they do?  They should call this number.  All right.  Do I really want to give this out?  Yeah.  Okay, it's 568-201-568-7493. 
[23:30]
 7493.  Yeah, and give me a day because I will put together some facts, directions, and if there  is anything that can come out.  It's on the 19th of December.  It's a Saturday.  Okay.  From 10 to 4.  All right.  And Sunday from 10 to 2.  And Dave might make an appearance on that.  So.  You two are going to box?  I'm talking to you on the air. 
[24:00]
 You two are going to have a fist fight?  Maybe, you know.  It could be interesting.  No.  All right.  Wow.  I always thought it was true love between you two.  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's a thin wavy line between father and daughter.  I never thought it was the older guy after the attractive young chick.  No one did.  But, wow.  So, you're looking forward to dating again?  You know, I'm a little rusty.  I really am.  But, actually, I do have a date Saturday night.  I'm proud to say.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[24:30]
 I was going to set you up with one of our listeners.  Yeah.  Oh, well, maybe.  You want to do that?  I'm afraid.  That's been very, for 13 years.  It is a little Howard Sternish, but I mean, how can we pass this up?  You want to come in and we'll get you a date?  Let me do a test run here Saturday night to see if I can remember how to do it.  I'll admit this is a blatant Stern riff-off, but it's too good.  This is too good.  All right, Libby.  Well, please keep in touch and let us know what's going on. 
[25:00]
 All right.  Okay.  There she is.  Libby Herman.  What are you using your maiden name again?  I'm debating.  These are the things that are hanging me up.  Is it going to be Libby Herman?  Is it Libby Park?  I don't know.  We'll call you Libby Park.  Okay, good.  All right, Libby.  All right.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Bye.  Wow.  Hello.  Well, there's a heavy little scene.  My goodness.  Do we got the number if someone wants to own a piece of Dave Herman? 
[25:30]
 We got it, right?  How could you be party to that?  What?  She's trying to raise some money, maybe to raise her kids.  I understand, but we don't have both sides of the story, Opie.  That's true.  I think that Libby's still listening.  Maybe we could auction some of the stuff off on our show.  That'd be huge.  We'd raise a ton of money.  Screw our feels for meals.  Well, now we better do feels for meals.  All right.  I wonder if Libby...  All right, Anthony.  We need to take a moment here and talk about Take Pause. 
[26:00]
 We've been talking about this all week.  It's a great gift to give to someone this holiday season.  Yes, it is.  They're cute little animals.  Lions, tigers, leopards.  Boy, girls love these things, man.  You give them to your sweetie, you'll look like the sensitive guy.  What are you going to get her?  A blender?  Are you going to get her a toaster oven?  Who gives their wife a blender for Christmas?  Some guys do.  They don't know.  They don't know that it makes you look like a jerk.  All right.  Well, these first Take Pause pets are limited, numbered, and not available in stores. 
[26:30]
 And just like Beanie Babies and Hummels and other collectibles, the first generation is  usually the most valuable.  They're very lifelike.  The eyes are very cool on these things.  If you want, you can enter to win a free Take Pause leopard, tiger, or lion.  All you have to do is go to the WWW website, WWW.com, and enter to win.  Also, from that point, you could go to the Take Pause website to check out what they're  all about.  All right.  Look them over.  So if you're online right now, enter to win the lion, the tiger, or the leopard. 
[27:00]
 Okay?  www.WW.com.  Or you could give Take Pause a call.  That number is toll free, 1-800-682-2266.  That number once again, 1-800-682-2266.  The Rock of New York, 1027-W-I-E-W.  It's Opie and Anthony, Leonard Skinner, Johnny Lang before that.  And still raining.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday, that is.  And lots and lots is going on. 
[27:30]
 FU Friday got a little real today, I do believe.  Yeah.  Lawyers are calling.  We've got copies of our show now.  It's just a mess.  Just a mess.  Why did she have to fax us?  No.  We had nothing to do with that.  I liked hearing from her.  I did.  I don't know what's going on.  Dave Herman's ex-wife, is it official?  I think they're in the middle of it.  They're in the middle of a divorce.  She called up.  And she faxed in a FU about Dave Herman. 
[28:00]
 Yeah.  And then we got her on the phone and we found out that it's a little ugly.  Yeah.  Between the two of them.  And she's going to sell all this stuff.  She's having a yard sale.  A yard sale.  Memorabilia.  Dave Herman's memorabilia.  Yeah.  Libby's going out in the yard with his stuff.  Crazy Libby!  Everything must go!  Hats, boots, pants, awards, gold records! 
[28:30]
 Wow.  Yeah.  Well divorce is never pretty.  No.  But I don't feel like testifying.  No.  That's what happens.  Can we just give them the tape and let them fight it out?  Yeah.  Man, I can't believe how real that was though.  That's how it is.  She had a lot of gripes.  She's saying that he's not paying child support or pays when he feels like it.  Those are her allegations, Opie.  We haven't heard from Dave so we don't know his side of this whole thing. 
[29:00]
 I don't know if we will but we open up the airwaves to him too.  Yes.  If he wants to respond to what she has said.  And Libby's thinking of getting a few of Dave's items together and we're going to auction  them off on our show.  That's what she said.  Yeah.  So we'll have to wait and see on that.  Well someone else in a messy little case today, Opie.  Bill Clinton is profoundly sorry.  He appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House to say he is profoundly sorry for all 
[29:30]
 I've done wrong.  In words and deeds, I have sinned against ye.  The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to recommend that he be impeached  for committing perjury before a grand jury.  Wow.  So now where do we go from here?  Well that's not really a surprise.  Everybody figured that would happen.  Now, I'm not sure what happens.  Well now they're on TV debating it.  Yeah.  And when did John Goodman get involved with the proceedings?  Who is that guy?  I didn't know he was a Congressman. 
[30:00]
 John Goodman.  I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit and all of a sudden I was like,  what's John Goodman doing there?  This guy looks just like him.  He does.  He's got a big fat head.  So now they're debating the issue?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They voted.  I don't know what they're debating.  Well they're in the middle of a debate because Barney Frank was on the tube.  Barney Frank, hi.  I don't think Bill Clinton did anything wrong.  Oh dear.  Oh my.  All right. 
[30:30]
 Where's my gerbil?  Scary.  All right.  Another FU coming in here, Anthony.  Gentlemen, would you kindly send out a spirited FU to my soon to be ex-wife of 17 years, to  her mother and most of all to her low life attorney.  They should all choke to death under the Christmas tree while opening presents.  Happy Holidays, Richie from Staten Island.  Oh, I thought it was Dave Herman.  No, no, no. 
[31:00]
 So keep your FUs coming in.  212-957-WNEW.  Yay!  1027-WNEW, the riot in New York with the cult love removal machine.  It's Opie and Anthony for FU Friday.  What's up, man?  And look who's in the studio.  It's Gary Hewitt.  As Roger, our promotions guy, pronounces it.  Where is Roger?  Because Roger is supposed to intro Gary Hoey today.  To give my name the official sound, Gary Hoey? 
[31:30]
 Howie, he goes.  He just has a really strange accent.  Have you listened to Howie?  That's what he says.  He's from, where is he from?  He's from Jersey, but he moved down south and got this accent that nobody should have.  No one should have this.  Is he coming in?  Is he here?  Roger?  You've got to go find Roger because Roger has an intro, Gary Hoey.  Gary, we've got to be honest.  We didn't know who you are when we first heard you were coming on our show.  That's okay, man. 
[32:00]
 Our promotions guy said, we have Gary Hoey coming on your show.  Right.  And you're like, Gary Whoey?  Whoey?  Yeah.  Well, I remember Hocus Pocus and stuff.  Sure.  Yeah, but we did a remake of that.  But, honestly, Anthony and I sat there and said, what the hell are we going to do with  Gary Hoey?  Do with Gary Hoey.  And we were pissed.  We were ticked off.  We were frustrated.  We had a copy of your CD.  And tragically, something happened to it and we weren't even able to listen to it.  Well, I brought my guitar.  So I got that in hand. 
[32:30]
 All right.  So we'll have some live heavy.  And I'm glad that you gave us more copies of your Christmas CDs because we did lose  the ones they sent.  Well, I brought those for you guys.  And I really want to say it's an honor to be on this station with you guys.  I really mean that.  I really mean that.  It's an honor.  I'm a huge fan.  I'm a huge fan of the Redcoats.  And I was watching the Legends thing on VH1 with Springsteen last night in the hotel.  And they kept showing interviews with him and it was from WDW.  Was that cool?  So I was really psyched. 
[33:00]
 Very cool.  So thanks for having me.  All right.  We can't really trash anymore then.  I do dig you guys.  I'll be honest though.  We did smash your CD.  We were so pissed.  We were just having a bad day.  Who is this?  What the hell are they throwing on me now?  We don't know if it's going to be some guy like Slim Whitman coming in and yodeling for us.  I understand.  Or this guy, Dogs. 
[33:30]
 This guy sent us Santa's in Jamaica.  And it's just...  That's what happens again to another one of his CDs.  That's the fifth CD of Dogs that we've smashed.  Did mine break that easy?  I want to send you guys stuff in metal now.  Just steal so you'll just smash it and smash.  Gary, we've smashed your CD just like that.  That's all right.  We've got to tell it like it is.  You guys are real, man.  I trashed hotel rooms.  I've done it. 
[34:00]
 But now I heard you're warming up and it sounds like you truly do rock.  Thanks, man.  I love to rock.  I've been playing guitar for 23 years.  I'm an instrumental guitar player.  It's like a salmon swimming upstream.  It's always a battle.  You've got a song.  You're going to do a Christmas song.  I put out a CD called Ho Ho Hoey.  It's just rock versions of all the Christmas classics.  I did it for a laugh in my basement.  My mom said you should make a nice Christmas record.  It was just a goof.  Let's check out Gary Hoey. 
[34:30]
 Here we go.  Ready?  Wow!  Thanks, man.  Who is this guitar guy?  Gary Hoey.  The guitar guy, Gary Hoey.  He has truly been sent to us from the heavens.  I feel like I'm in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  Wow!  Oh my God.  We'll give it to you, man.  That's sick.  That kicked ass, I would say. 
[35:00]
 It's not your grandfather's Christmas song.  Not for the Bing fans, man.  No.  Who did he do his little duet with?  Who knows?  Who did he do his Christmas one?  David Bowie.  Maybe you could play with some old fart.  It'd be cool.  I did a gig once when Mel Torme was on the gig.  Did you?  And Bob Hope, man.  Bob Hope.  Hey, that was great. 
[35:30]
 I had some guitar playing.  Too bad I couldn't see you.  My eyes are bleeding.  That was it.  You were there, man.  Do you want to do another one?  I would love to, man.  Okay, we're hanging with Gary Hoey.  His CDs are called Ho Ho Hoey One.  Ho Ho Hoey One.  And Ho Ho Hoey Two.  In stores now and he's got a website.  Everyone has a website these days.  You got to, man.  What song are you going to do next, Gary? 
[36:00]
 I was thinking of doing your mean one, Mr. Grinch.  I'd like to hear that.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  It's Hope and Anthony on FU Friday.  Uriah Heap, Easy Living.  I want to roll up a doobie.  You're digging that song, Gary?  I was digging it, bro.  Big time.  We're hanging with Gary Hoey.  If you're just tuning in, we made peace with Mr. Hoey.  After you smashed my CDs.  We did smash your CDs last week.  I brought you new ones.  I know. 
[36:30]
 Honestly, I'm going to bring these home and I'm going to play them.  Thanks, brother.  I'm sick of my Bing Crosby Christmas album.  Those are made of airplane metal, man.  You can't break those?  I can't.  Whoa, he's ready to rock again.  Can you do the Bill and Ted thing?  I don't know what that would be.  Let's try it.  Yeah.  That's what it sounded like when he was playing before.  Well, you've got a couple CDs out, Ho Ho Hoey 1 and Ho Ho Hoey 2. 
[37:00]
 Where's Roger?  He's supposed to be saying this.  They're in stores now and you've got a website, www.hoeyhoey.net.  But we're ready to hear another Christmas song.  Wait, here's Roger.  Roger's got an intro on because he's got the wacky accent.  Let's do it, man.  Roger's walking right behind you.  Look at this guy.  First of all, you've got to explain.  You're from Jersey?  You're originally from Jersey?  Correct. 
[37:30]
 And then you moved to?  Atlanta.  So anybody raising children in Jersey, never move down south or your kid will sound like this.  Yeah, from Georgia.  We need a little warm up.  Say the Goo Goo Dolls.  The Goo Goo Dolls?  See what I put up?  I come to a station and the abuse I take is incredible.  Repeat after me.  I'm getting you guys a limo.  This is how he talks.  We're not making him talk this way. 
[38:00]
 Without further ado, why don't you intro Gary Hoey.  He's going to do another Christmas song for us.  And on WNEW, we'd like to welcome Gary Hoey.  All right.  Yeah.  Thanks, Roger.  You're welcome, man.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Thanks, man.  It's like Christmas with Satan.  Yeah. 
[38:30]
 Rock.  Waking up the way he does.  Let's go smoke some dough.  What else do you say?  That's great.  That is really good, Gary.  Gary Hoey in the studio doing something a little different today.  The Grinch song.  That was on last night.  Did you watch it?  Yeah, it was good.  I've seen it 30 times now.  For some reason, they don't hold up with age, those things.  When you're a kid, you look forward to seeing them and you watch them now. 
[39:00]
 Well, they're too short.  I know if you buy the video without the commercials, it's like 12 minutes.  Yeah.  Like Frosty the Snowman and stuff?  Yeah.  Those are like seven minutes long.  I remember watching Rudolph as a kid and it seemed like a long, scary thing.  They're very scary.  I want to be a dentist.  Yeah, but that's because it came on at 630 and bedtime was 7.  It seemed like a long period of time.  Wow, I'm exhausted. 
[39:30]
 It's like a quarter to 7.  Betty Bye.  Getting late.  I'm going to go to bed.  You got one more in you, you think?  Yeah, man.  Hi, everybody.  This is Soupy Sale, wishing all you wonderful WNEW FM listeners a very Merry Christmas and  a great Happy New Year.  I found a bunch of these Christmas things here from one of the Station 8 moose.  Soupy Sale, Soupy Sale. 
[40:00]
 Hi, this is Soupy Sale.  I'm a dick.  I'm going to give you the honor of smashing the Soupy Sale's Christmas ID.  Considering we smashed your CD last week.  Go ahead, just wail it anywhere.  That was the last time you'll hear it.  Wow, there you go.  Oh, gotta throw it against the wall.  There it is.  Thank you.  There you go.  Wow, Rick, I'll give you the raise.  Take it easy, brother. 
[40:30]
 A little aggression there.  My road manager is going nuts on you here.  All right, we got another Christmas song from Gary Hoey on the way.  This is Dire Straits on the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Opi and Anthony and our new pal, Gary Hoey.  Believe it or not, we now like the man an awful lot.  After trashing him relentlessly last week when we heard he was going to be on the show,  I have to admit, we were wrong, Gary. 
[41:00]
 You know what?  Any exposure is good exposure, man.  It's trash.  It went as far as Anthony and I asking to have today off.  So we didn't have to deal with you.  Well, I'm glad it wasn't that difficult for you.  Well, I'm just trying to, now that we know each other a little better,  I'm just letting you know what happened last week.  It was a learning experience.  We smacked each other, we yelled at the boss, told him we weren't coming in today.  Hey, you know, I've had things where people have called me up and said,  dude, you gotta go do...  All right, there we go. 
[41:30]
 We just dumped out of it.  It's okay.  It's all right.  That's how it is in here.  We're loose, man.  You feel like you're just talking and you throw the S word around.  Well, I'm sorry.  You let me break things so I could start swearing and smoking pot.  Smoking pot.  Hey, can we get a DiMaggio update here?  Yes.  What is the DiMaggio update?  Well, last we heard, when last we left Joe, he was near death's door.  Yes.  It was pretty much it.  Joe DiMaggio has awakened from his coma. 
[42:00]
 The doctors are saying, you won't believe it, but he's awake, moving his head and grabbing my hand.  It's completely unexpected.  The coma that was present deeply this morning is just not there now.  Jolton Joe is just... he's in a rundown.  Yeah, with life and death.  Life and death.  Where is he going?  It's like a plot for a wacky sitcom or something.  So now he's doing okay.  It changes by the hour with Jolton Joe. 
[42:30]
 Portrait of a desperate bulter.  Yeah.  Well, we wish him the best.  I don't know.  They're putting odds on him now.  It still doesn't look good.  On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best outlook, Barron said,  This is the doctor, DiMaggio was a 0.5 early this morning and had improved to a 1 by this afternoon.  It's still a very dire situation.  The whole thing could change in 15 minutes.  Unbelievable. 
[43:00]
 All right.  Oh, poor Joe.  Instead of winds doing traffic on the 10s, we could do the Joe DiMaggio updates.  Joe DiMaggio and weather on the 1s.  Also, there's a bunch of people calling and faxing an email asking us if that whole Dave Herman's ex-wife thing was for real.  Yeah, it's real.  We don't do fake things on this show.  They can't believe we actually talked to Dave Herman's ex-wife because I guess they're getting divorced.  Yeah.  And we were reading our FUs. 
[43:30]
 They pile up because it is FU.  And we were reading our FUs.  And we were reading our FUs.  And we were reading our FUs.  And we were reading our FUs.  And we were reading our FUs.  They pile up because it is FU Friday.  We're going through the faxes and we're reading them.  And all of a sudden there's one from Libby Herman.  And we had gotten faxes from Libby before.  Nothing indicating that there was a problem in hers and Dave's marriage.  She's been a huge fan of our show since day one, by the way.  Yeah.  And then today we get this. 
[44:00]
 Where is that fax?  Because she has a lot of complaints on there.  Oh, the lawyers took it?  Oh my God.  And then they took a bunch of his stuff.  Memorabilia.  Well, supposedly Libby, this is like a soap opera.  There goes the hotline.  Uh-oh.  I wonder who that could be.  Hey, Rick, check the hotline.  Yeah, check that hotline.  That might be some...  We might get a rebuttal.  We might have to talk to. 
[44:30]
 I guess Libby locked Dave out of the house.  Dave only pays child support when he feels like this is all Libby's doing.  According to Libby.  And Dave wanted Libby institutionalized at one point.  I mean, he took the kids away, but now she's got them back.  Yeah, there's the complaints right there.  Um, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  And then she goes on to say, uh, maybe as a public service, you could give my garage sale a plug.  And it says, see attached.  And it's a list of all the stuff that she's selling of Dave Herman's.  So everyone's been calling saying, is this true?  Because I really want a piece of Dave. 
[45:00]
 Yeah.  It's true, people.  Dave's a celebrity.  Yeah.  And, and, and people want some of this memorabilia, I guess.  And at this point, I guess Libby needs money to raise her kids.  Right.  So now Rick is telling me that she has changed her answer machine and now she's giving out, uh, directions to her garage sale.  So we're dialing up the number.  Let's see what that's all about.  Can we give out the number for the garage sale again?  She should do okay.  What number is it? 
[45:30]
 Is it the same number that I'm calling?  Yeah.  Okay.  201-568-7493 if you want, uh, some items from Libby Herman's garage sale.  I wonder if, uh, she's selling that, that big long leather coat and hat he wore in the,  any W commercials back in the eighties where he looked like Indiana Jones.  That would be worth something.  Wow.  I'd, I'd, I'd buy that.  I might put a bid in for that.  Hello?  Libby? 
[46:00]
 Yeah.  You didn't get in trouble, did you?  No, I, I, I, I'll be.  Yeah.  I don't care.  You know, in fact, I was thinking I'm going through some boxes downstairs.  This really should be, uh, an auction some of this stuff.  Maybe I should come up and you can do some digital pictures or something.  Put them on the website.  That's a good idea.  We're thinking of maybe having you come up with a box of this stuff and we'll, uh, we'll auction it off on the air and give you all the money for your children.  You know, Libby's kids.  Why not? 
[46:30]
 Libby's kids.  What do we got?  They're a little retarded too, I must say.  You know?  What kind of stuff you got that you want to auction off?  You know what?  Let me go downstairs.  I have, I have Stone Pony t-shirts.  I have Bruce Springsteen t-shirts.  I have, uh, something a listener made me, a Born in the USA crochet, you know, Bippy top.  I have, uh, you know, Billy Joel t-shirts.  I have all the old N.E.W. baseball t-shirts.  You know, the jerseys. 
[47:00]
 I have a listener, uh, you know, members only jackets.  Members only jackets.  And you're willing to sell all this stuff?  I, I, I'm willing to part with it.  We're practically giving it away!  It's crazy Libby!  I am.  I really am.  It's insane what we have down there.  Wow, you've had it, huh?  I have had it.  You can say that, yeah.  I have, listen, you know.  Baby needs a new pair of shoes. 
[47:30]
 What's your day like on Saturday, by the way?  I've been going out with a very sane guy.  Yeah.  Which is very unlike me.  Uh, you know, he called twice.  The first time he called, I was comatose, sleeping drool coming out of my mouth.  You know, and then he had the nerve to call back again and I was asleep.  And so he called back again, you know, perseverance.  And, uh, he's just very sweet.  He's a friend of mine's cousin.  All right.  Long Island. 
[48:00]
 He's got a very steady date.  Now, what are the chances you might give him some this weekend?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, he has a situation where he has children, he's going through a divorce, he  is very brave to, you know, go out with me.  So we just decided that we are calling you today.  It is an official date.  Right on.  You should do it on a Tuesday so you can become a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yeah, I love that.  That's a good teaser. 
[48:30]
 You know, putting people together in the world.  I love that.  All right, Libby.  Well, go downstairs and get some of this stuff and we'll talk about some of this stuff up  for auction.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Libby.  Bye.  Join us next time for The Hermans.  It's like a soap.  There you have it.  In case you thought we were making the whole thing up.  You're in shock like everyone else right now.  Pretty much, man. 
[49:00]
 Okay.  All right, so you got the two CDs out, Ho Ho Hoey 1 and Ho Ho Hoey 2 in stores now.  You got the website, www.hoey.net and you're going to do another one for us.  Absolutely.  What are you going to do?  I thought we'd do a little version of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.  It's a nice, tender Christmas ballad that's been known to raise the dead.  All right, cool.  Should we do it?  Here we go.  Smash it, smash it, smash the guitar. 
[49:30]
 Smash it.  Yeah.  Right on, Gary.  Damn, you rock.  You do rock.  Gary Hoey, everyone.  I feel like a buffoon for ragging him last week.  You feel like complete a-holes, Gary.  I thought he was going to come in.  I thought, you know, all right, Gary Hoey, he does Christmas songs on guitar.  I picked you some Kumbaya jack off coming in here.  Okay, we're going to play some Christmas songs. 
[50:00]
 And then you come in here and play the devil's rock version of Christmas.  I love it.  It's hardcore Christmas.  Hardcore Christmas.  Well, thanks for having me, guys.  This has been so much fun, man.  Cool.  Well, you've got a couple CDs out, Ho Ho Hoey 1 and Ho Ho Hoey 2 in stores now.  Absolutely.  I just want to wish everybody in New York a safe, happy holiday.  And just say I was really psyched to come in and see you guys today.  I mean that. 
[50:30]
 And I don't even care that you trashed me for a few days.  I understand, man.  You guys, you're doing your job.  At least we're open-minded to have you come in and go through the process  and see what happens.  I have no hard feelings, brother.  And look how you've redeemed yourself like that.  Well, you know, like I said, I'm like a salmon swimming upstream, man.  This isn't the first time I've been, you know,  and I'm like, I'm going to do what I do.  You know, you just got to do what you do, man.  You know, and just hopefully people will dig in.  If they don't, you just keep doing it.  Well, we can relate to that because that's exactly what happens with me 
[51:00]
 and Anthony on a daily basis trying to do this radio show.  So yeah, what are we doing being so prejudiced?  Yeah.  We hope people like what we do.  Well, I like what you guys do.  All right, Gary.  Thanks a lot for stopping by.  My pleasure.  Happy holidays, man.  Right on.  I hope you're enjoying it.  This is the first time we've been in the cemented world.  Oh, just available in every record store across the country.  Yeah, it's on dickhead records and tapes.  Our record company. 
[51:30]
 Well, be nice.  Our record company called us today, Anthony.  Yeah, and he had some good news for us.  Yeah, great.  We shipped 80 units this week.  That's what he said.  So that ought to just saturate the New York market there, boy, let me tell you.  80 units?  Woo!  back alley alone. 80 units. It shouldn't be a few zeros behind that. 80? What 80 large  you talking about? No, 80. 
[52:00]
 It should be we just shipped 80,000.  Oh wait a minute. Oh that was just some mustard. I meant 8. As I look here at the sheet. That's  not 80.  So good luck while you're shopping this weekend.  Makes a great Christmas gift.  Yeah, trying to find our Opium Anthony Dementor World CD. Good luck. They shipped 80 this  week. So the odds are greatly increased that you can find one. Jesus, son of God.  I bet that nearly doubles the amount that's in New York now.  What the hell happened to us? We used to be somebody.  You sound like Dice now. 
[52:30]
 I know. We're heading that way fast.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Stone Temple Pilots and Creep ZZ Top. Before that it's  Opium Anthony. Another Wacky Friday Show in progress. Still have a lot to get to before  we get out of here.  It's getting a little weird.  Yes, a little surreal. Anthony, I think it's time for the hourly smash of Santa's in Jamaica. 
[53:00]
 You want to explain what this is all about?  Well, Dukes, as they call them, sent us Santa's in Jamaica.  The Duke-ster.  We've got a million copies of it. We've been smashing them hourly. We tried playing it,  but found its entertainment value to rank somewhere around Joe DiMaggio's longevity  from today on. We're smashing them every hour. 
[53:30]
 This thing is not much better than a Kajik Gugu record.  Let's put our safety goggles on.  Do I get to break this one?  Yes, you can break that one.  Be careful.  By the way, this is the sixth copy of Santa's in Jamaica CD that we're breaking. The guy  called us up. I guess he plays shortstop for the NAW softball team. Not no mo. He said  that this is the hottest Christmas song in Jamaica.  In Jamaica, really?  Yes, well, it's not doing much in the States. 
[54:00]
 Here we go. Here's Santa's in Jamaica. Let's play through this one.  Let's track through it.  Wait a minute.  What happened? It got away from you?  Yeah, that was a big four, man.  No, give it another one.  I will. Hold on.  It's coming apart.  Oh, wow. Boy, that blew it up real good.  Okay, keep sending those CDs in, please. We need more CDs to smash.  Track through that.  Anthony, as I get the pieces of CD out of my eye, explain the Libby Herman thing real 
[54:30]
 fast because we've got five guys on hold that want to date Dave Herman's wife.  Well, this has just taken on a life of its own. Libby Herman, Dave's wife, you might  remember Dave Herman was the morning guy here for many years at NAW Radio. It's FU  Friday today and she faxed in an FU to date. I don't think anyone really knew this, but  they were having a lot of problems, I guess, in their marriage and they're getting a divorce. 
[55:00]
 Yeah.  So she faxed in a big FU. You want to read a couple of things off of the FU?  Yeah, the lawyers gave the facts back, so I guess we can read it again.  All right.  Dear Opian Anthony, I have a big FU shout out for NAW alumni Dave Herman. I don't know  if you're aware of it or not, but we're in the process of getting a divorce. He has placed  a restraining order on me because he thought I would spousally abuse him. He underhandedly  took custody of my two children. I got them back. He is not paying child support. I understand 
[55:30]
 if you have reservations about shouting out this particular FU, not very PC perhaps, maybe  as a public service you can give my garage sale a plug. See you attached.  Now we've got to say that these are all Libby's allegations.  Yeah.  That we haven't heard from Dave or his side of it, but this is what Libby's saying and  we open up the airwaves to Dave if he wants to respond.  Correct. And Libby wants us to give out her number for the garage sale. She's actually 
[56:00]
 taking his stuff because I guess she locked him out of the house for a while.  Yeah, she's got a bunch of memorabilia from NAW, Rock and Roll, Dave Herman, The Morning  Show, and she's selling it.  You could own a piece of Dave Herman is what this comes down to. So the number is 201-568-7493.  She's serious. I guess she needs the money to raise her kids at this point.  Right.  And we're trying to give you a piece of Dave Herman by giving away his wife.  Now, you know, I'll be the first one to say, growing up in New York and being a huge Howard 
[56:30]
 Stern fan, this is blatant Howard Stern.  Yeah, we'll admit it.  I'll be the first to admit it. This has shades of DiBella written all over it. But it's just  too good to pass up.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  For God's sake.  You want to talk to one of these guys?  Yeah.  Hey buddy.  Yes.  I hear you want to go out with Libby Herman.  I think that she sounds like a pretty together lady.  All right. What could you offer her?  I could offer her, oh Lord, a good cup of coffee, a lot of conversation. 
[57:00]
 Wait a minute. What do you do for a living?  I'm retired.  You're retired?  I'm a retired college professor.  How old are you?  I'm 62.  No, no, that's how old Dave Herman was. I think she wants some young supple meat at this point.  She's a young girl.  Well, my friends say I look like 48. Let her make her of her own mind.  How old is she? She's like a young girl.  She's 23 years younger than Dave.  Now you're talking. Now I'm interested.  Yeah, but she wants somebody that doesn't need Viagra. 
[57:30]
 Oh God.  All right. Hold on the line. We'll talk to her. Hold on.  Well, thank you.  Hello?  Libby?  Yeah?  Libby, my name is Richard.  Wait, Richard, I'll introduce you.  Richard, hold on.  God damn.  What?  Libby, how are you? It's Hope and Anthony again.  Hold on. I'm listening to you in the background. I got blaring out of my speakers. Hold on a second.  All right.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  I don't know whether they're going to interrupt us again.  Wait a minute. Hold on, guy. Just wait for the formal introduction. 
[58:00]
 You're a horned dog.  Please. Okay. I'm ready.  This gentleman called up. What's your name, sir?  Richard.  Richard called up because he's interested in dating you.  We're getting these guys calling up now that want to date you.  Oh, wow.  You sound like a really cool chick.  Those are not my words.  But there's a problem.  What?  How old are you, Rich?  I just turned 62.  No way, man. I've been there, done that. Sorry.  She wants a young guy. 
[58:30]
 Hey, listen, I wish you the best no matter what.  No, I hate to make a rash decision like that, but I don't know.  What, you want a boy toy?  Yeah.  You want like an 18-year-old guy?  Yeah.  Hey, listen, I have my son call.  Yeah. You can make us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or something.  Oh, God.  Libby, we could get you a young stud if you want.  Stud muffin?  Yeah.  I'm serious. Yeah.  Oh, that'd be great. You're really, you know, this is very, this sounds like fun. 
[59:00]
 Hey, did Dave like our show, by the way?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  He did before I called.  I think before I called he really liked it.  Yeah, I don't think he'll be liking it that much now.  No, I don't, you know, I don't know. We don't speak, so.  Yeah.  Yeah. I call him and he hangs up on me. That's our repertoire.  Well, we'll admit this is very Howard Sternish, but if you want, if you come in here, we will find you a young stud to go out with.  Yeah?  Yeah, we'll set you up. We'll put you on the date. We'll chaperone it so you don't get an axe murderer. 
[59:30]
 That'd be great. I would do that, sure.  While you're up here, we could also auction off some of Dave's stuff.  Listen, can I chaperone that date?  Oh, hey, shut up, guy.  Chaperone that date?  Oh, Rich, she already blew you off, Rich.  You're done, man.  Well, it was a good try anyway.  All right, Rich.  You guys are great.  Thanks, buddy.  I'm getting so much promotion from you guys.  Good luck, dear lady.  You know what? My boss is here. I better behave myself. I'm real estate.  Well, did you get some of the stuff that you want to auction off? 
[60:00]
 I did. It's upstairs. You're until seven, right?  Yeah.  Can I call you back in like 15 minutes?  Yeah, you got it.  Okay.  All right, bye.  All right, there she goes once again, Libby.  All right.  So call back in a few minutes with the items that she wants to sell of Dave's.  The items up for bid.  Yes.  Crazy Libby.  Crazy Libby. She's practically giving it all away.  Oh, my God. Divorce is brutal, isn't it?  Isn't it? It's just so damn ugly.  Yes, it is.  On the way, everyone is requesting Steve Lynch songs. 
[60:30]
 You know, our pal from last Friday.  Yes.  We will end the show today with Lullaby.  All right, coming up, we'll talk to Libby again to see what items are up for bid.  All right.  All right.  This is sick.  Why are people yelling and screaming? Did you hear that?  There's a party going on.  Where's that party going on?  Everybody's ready to go to the party.  Yeah, we got the company Christmas party tonight.  Is it just any W or is it CBS or is it WINS?  I think it's just us. I think it's just any W, maybe WINS as well. 
[61:00]
 We're going to have a lot of fun tonight.  WINS.  Yeah.  We'll sit down and hear the news from people.  So what's new? Did you hear today at the impeachment hearings?  Drink, please. Have a drink over here.  What time is it? Oh, it's 9.01. Time for traffic.  Traffic and weather together.  Together on the ones.  Dude, lighten up.  Hey guys, I'm going home in the next 10 minutes. What do you think of the traffic?  That's good. Hey, and now with sports, it's Jim. 
[61:30]
 The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW Creed.  What's this life for from their debut CD, My Own Prison?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  We're waiting for Libby Herman to call back with the items up for bid.  Libby, if you're listening, because she listens to our show, call us right now.  We'll put you on the air, please.  Okay.  In the meantime, it is FU Friday.  We forgot to talk about the lady that's suing Starbuck.  Ah, FU to her.  I hate those people.  More burned coffee people suing. 
[62:00]
 This woman had coffee spilled on her ankle.  Well, what happened was she got a cup of coffee from Starbucks.  And she was getting the cream and the milk together.  And she says like a couple drops hit her wrist.  Oh, yeah.  Which freaked her out because it burned her a little bit.  So then she spills the whole damn thing on her ankle.  It burns her ankle.  Right.  And it was a pretty nasty burn.  If that's how she got it.  And now she's suing Starbucks for a million dollars.  Now, who would she sue if she was home making coffee and dropped it on her foot? 
[62:30]
 Knowing that coffee is hot.  Right.  What's the difference?  Right.  I don't understand how these are actual lawsuits and that people get the million dollars.  Remember the lady with the hot coffee that burned her groin?  Yeah.  The McDonald's coffee.  And they ended up giving her a couple million dollars.  Her crotch was worth two million.  Yeah.  Well, whatever it was.  And this girl's ankle, for some reason, is worth a million bucks.  Are we going to have to start putting warnings on the side of coffee cups? 
[63:00]
 Yes.  Yes, Opie.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous, though.  Thanks.  Wow.  You're making a stand.  Wow.  I like that.  I'm just wasting time.  I'm hoping Libby would call back.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't notice.  I know.  Oh, well.  I guess she's not going to call us.  Uh-oh.  News just in.  What is that that you got in your hand?  Is that about Joe?  No, I'm looking at it.  Jolton Joe?  How's Jolton Joe doing?  Is he dead yet, or is he in the starting lineup for next season?  He's still in the rundown between life and death.
