 You little freak.  I find you who post it.  I'll be an Anthony.  It's like it's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're gonna have to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  We refuse to be responsible.  We refuse to be responsible. 
[00:30]
 One, two, seven.  It is Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  We don't have a boss right now.  What do we officially?  I don't know.  You know, all I can say is within the last, we've been here what, a year and a half?  Yeah.  And I officially have seniority over everyone in this place.  Hey, that's right. Look at that.  Oh, no, which means we're the next to go. 
[01:00]
 Wow, we have seniority? That was quick.  We've been here longer than every single person now.  Oh my God. It's like the frigging Gambino family in this place.  I swear to God.  I mean, any W was the station where guys like die.  You know, they stay here until they die.  Till they drop.  Their careers were what, like 40 years long?  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your services are no longer needed here. 
[01:30]
 Take the cannolis. Leave the gun.  Paulie, you won't be seeing him no more.  Well, well, well, well.  Yeah, this was the place where people died.  And within a year and a half, we are now top dogs.  We've been here longer than anyone else.  How about that? How'd that happen?  So are they speculating anywhere? 
[02:00]
 What do you mean? The media? Anything?  Can we talk about this? Are we allowed?  I don't know what we can talk about anymore.  Call upstairs. Let's ask her whole box.  Get them on the phone.  Get them on the phone, for God's sake.  We're actually really sad today because the guy who brought us to New York,  a guy, believe it or not, we got along with tragically died in a car accident.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, that old guy.  He's doing all right.  But he will no longer be our boss. 
[02:30]
 Yeah.  So we're kind of sad today, to be honest with you. I do feel kind of bad.  All kidding aside, because he was the guy who hired us.  Boy, all the authority figures just dropping like flies around here.  What happened to Roger?  I don't know.  It's pretty pathetic.  People used to come here and like their careers would end when they would die, basically. 
[03:00]
 Yeah.  They want to leave this place until they drop dead like a time capsule.  30, 40 year careers at this place.  After a year and a half, just to show you the turmoil we've been through,  we've been here longer than just about everyone now.  Opie, Anthony, you two are the survivors.  Oh, man. Wait a minute. We can do a whole play of this.  Hold on, man. We got to do this right.  Where is my music?  Hold on, it's late.  Oh, wait. I think my CD is stuck in my big camel toe. 
[03:30]
 Hold on, it's late.  Spaz Johnson almost runs over.  Almost runs him over. Look at this.  Where is my flute?  Spaz's brain was not one of these survivors.  Freaking idiot. 
[04:00]
 Like, he panics. He's got to find the Titanic CD, right?  And there's that whole shopping cart filled with all our bits and CDs.  Look how messy it is.  So he pulls the two CDs off the top so he can start shuffling through to look for them.  There it is. It was the one he threw to the side.  Spaz's brain was damaged more than the mighty Titanic on her maiden voyage.  It is as if a giant iceberg struck his head and dented his brain. 
[04:30]
 Is this it?  Well, I thought we'd do a different version, though.  Oh, no. You got to have the real Celine song when everyone knows.  All right, Celine, you're going to dedicate this to Opie and Anthony for outlasting everyone around here?  This song goes out to those that sailed on that ship, that plague-ridden ship that was WNEW.  You all know the people that did not make it.  The Pat St. John's, the Scottsos, and the Carol Millers. 
[05:00]
 All of them that perished in the wreck that was WNEW.  Many have passed through her, but there have not been many that still remain.  Except for two. Two that cling on like cockroaches.  They cannot be killed by ordinary means.  They outlasted people that we thought would be there forever. 
[05:30]
 The ill-fated station that was WNEW and those that live on within her walls.  Opie and Anthony. The only two survivors.  This goes out to you two, brave or stupid individuals, that remain at your mics, at your posts, broadcasting to those who want to listen. 
[06:00]
 Those that used to be here, the Dave Hermans, they are gone.  Remember the Gary Walls.  Wasn't he at the helm when the ship struck the iceberg?  I believe he was.  And now, the latest victim, Scott Herman.  The lovable curmudgeon.  Can he be considered a curmudgeon? 
[06:30]
 We will miss him, but we must go on.  Remember Roger, the promotion guy?  Remember his promotion ship hit a giant pop-cart and sank on his first day at sea, here at WNEW.  He is gone.  Steven Sewell are gone.  Oh wait, no, not yet.  You cannot consider them survivors.  They've gone under and we no longer see bubbles coming up. 
[07:00]
 Celine, that's a common attraction.  But two brave souls move on, clinging to the wreckage.  Opie and Anthony are truly survivors.  Life! 
[07:30]
 Steven Sewell have been under the murky waters of the North Atlantic for months now.  They're turning blue.  Remember Marty, Dennis Elsens and Pete Fornatelle?  And look, look at the lunatic who's locked himself into the engine room.  Vince Skelton.  We'll get him too. 
[08:00]
 Jim Moynihan.  Those that have perished. Richard Neer.  Remember?  All of them gone.  Dano. Remember Dano?  Gone.  But two, two live on in the tattered hulk of a station that was NWN and is now FM Talk at 1027. 
[08:30]
 It chugs on.  They keep their heads above waters to remain survivors.  Remember Ken Dashow and Ralph Tatora?  Oh my God, were there a thousand people on this ship, though?  These are all guys that were here while we were here.  There weren't enough lifeboats to sustain life.  Let's not forget all the records.  The largest rock and roll library. 
[09:00]
 Remember Lisa Garvey?  Oh my God.  Gone.  Don't forget Joe Taggart.  Joe Taggart.  We can keep going.  For one week, he was on the decks of this mighty ship.  Boy, that was one of Gary Wall.  I think Gary Wall threw him overboard.  And then he was at the helm.  Remember Gary at the helm?  Oh my God.  The mighty ship hit many icebergs. 
[09:30]
 And these two ass wipes remain on her decks.  Bye bye Scott Herman.  We will miss you.  Opie and Anthony, the two survivors.  I can't even believe these were on.  Opie, he's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony.  What a douchebag.  Train wreck radio.  Stand over. 
[10:00]
 This is sicker than faces of death.  1827, WNEW.  You didn't really think we got fired today, did you?  Come on.  Did you?  Of course not.  They know which side of the bread their butters buttered on.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We are here.  We are live.  It's Thursday, January 13, 2000. 
[10:30]
 Hey.  A lot of people thought we got fired and that's why it took so long to get on the radio today, Anthony.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  A little very important things we were up to.  I was watching Hillary, the videotape of Hillary on Letterman, that non-event.  Yeah.  And then, how to play some Half Life.  About it, right?  I think that's it.  Very important.  We're taking our time getting in the studio today and also in the phone rings at my desk. 
[11:00]
 Yeah.  And I pick it up and the guy goes, hey, where's Opie and Anthony today?  I'm like, well, we're right here.  I'm talking to you and Ant's playing Half Life.  Aren't you guys supposed to be on the air right now?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  And right after I stopped talking to you, I'm going to walk down the hall and we'll start our show.  Oh, all right, man.  I thought you got fired after yesterday's show.  That was just...  You know that was the best show you guys have ever done, don't you?  Yeah, they like that one, huh?  And so far, everyone's keeping quiet about the little CBS thing, Anthony. 
[11:30]
 Yeah, so far.  I check my messages on my cell phone, God, about five times this morning.  I was totally expecting you to be going, Anthony, got to come in early.  We got a meeting.  No, I stayed away from phones since yesterday's show.  I didn't want to get that call.  Yeah.  You know, the call.  The call.  We've had the call in the past.  And to everyone listening from the New York Radio Message Board, go F yourselves. 
[12:00]
 Oh, again.  They're trying to tell us how to do our show.  Won't they ever learn?  Yeah, I know.  It's just a matter of time before they get fired, just like they did in Boston.  You can't screw with your own company.  We didn't go out of our way to screw with our own company yesterday.  It just happened to be the only TV station that we could mess with.  Doing some fun radio.  Down at the Letterman's studio.  That's it.  They don't get it.  They'd rather, you know, what are we supposed to do?  Get on and pull a Penn Darvish for five hours?  Do some rock blacks?  Talk about some giveaways. 
[12:30]
 You know, I mean, Jesus Christ.  We have to shake it up a little bit.  And then whenever we do, they get on and go, see, they're out of control.  Well, yeah, we're out of control.  We want to be out of control.  They're like, they just want us to calm down.  Yeah.  No one's going to listen to us if we calm down.  No.  Personal message to Alan Sniffin who runs the New York Radio Message Board.  Type this, Opie and Anthony don't give a F.  Right. 
[13:00]
 And it's the internet where you can type in all the letters to the F.  Right.  That sums up our radio show.  Figure it out.  We don't care.  Yeah, we just made a verbal posting.  We were on top of the world in Boston when we got fired.  We don't care.  We know what we're doing.  We're taking chances.  We're mixing things up.  We're getting people to talk about this radio show.  And what happens happens.  If we get fired again, oh well.  Oh well.  Off to another metropolitan area.  But trust me, we're not that stupid.  We know what we're doing.  This is how we do radio.  We take it to the limit.  Have a little fun. 
[13:30]
 My God.  No one else in this town is brave enough to take it to the limit.  So we're going to do it.  And if it means getting fired again, oh well, Alan.  Go drill some teeth.  Go drill some teeth is right.  Now they're all writing.  I mean, they should change the New York Radio Message Board to the Opie and Anthony Board.  I wonder if he's ever come upon a situation where like there was a maybe he should have  done a root canal, but he figured he's going to just go crazy and fill the tooth instead  of having a root canal done.  Just I'll fill it and I'll see what happens because I'm a mad man. 
[14:00]
 Right.  I wonder if people criticize him.  Dude, you're out of control.  You're going to you're like a crazy person with that filling.  You're like a crazy person with that filling.  You're going to you're like a crazy person with that filling.  Yeah.  You know, you should have done a root canal.  Mr. Denton, you made a big statement today.  Opie and Anthony will get fired from New York just like they did in Boston.  Will these two ever learn?  If you if we get fired.  Oh, well, I'm going to go to dental school so I could run a radio message and still be 
[14:30]
 in the business.  Oh, God.  Well, the phones are going nuts, obviously.  Yeah.  I saw CBS television exec in the W.A.W. building.  Oh, everyone talking about yesterday's little thing.  We got we got a great little promo about yesterday's show that Jimmy from the production  department and Psycho Mark actually helped out.  Yes. 
[15:00]
 They put that together.  So I guess we got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Quickly before we go to break.  You ever you ever drive your piece of crap car and maybe it breaks down and someone lends  you a really good car and you drive it around and you never want to go back to your piece  of crap again?  What do you get that?  I left my laptop at home.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Scott Colombo just hooked me up with this one.  This is the dream come true.  Look at this.  Look at this thing. 
[15:30]
 Adele.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of it.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, look at you styling today, Anthony.  That's not now.  I got to go back to my piece of crap tomorrow.  I might have to make off with this thing.  All right.  So we have lots to do.  Let's take a quick break.  Well, we're going to play the Psycho Mark CBS montage thing we put together and we're  going to go to the phones next.  Everyone on hold. 
[16:00]
 Stay right where you are.  And if you want to give us a call to one to seven five seven one oh two seven.  Oh, be an Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone?  Somebody's uterus.  More stupidity on the way.  One oh two seven.  W.N.E.W.  And if you got something for the show to one to seven five seven one oh two seven, it's  the opening.  Anthony show.  Hey, a lot of people patiently waiting on hold to talk to us.  And yes, look at that.  Let's start with Mike.  Mike, what's going on, man?  Hey, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  All right.  You guys had me sweating when I heard that Celine Dion survivor thing played again. 
[16:30]
 I thought you guys didn't survive.  Yesterday was some of the best radio I ever heard.  Survivor.  Survivor.  We are truly still survivors.  So far, we're survivors.  I almost pissed my pants for a half an hour yesterday.  We appreciate it.  That's all anyone's talking about around here today.  I want to know what you guys are going to do today to top it though.  See, that's the problem with the opening, Anthony show.  Now we'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one. 
[17:00]
 We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  We'll go to the next one.  I don't think you guys will suck.  You guys are going to rock on, man.  Alright, bro.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Is that a train?  Yeah, there you go.  No, you're doing alright.  I have a good one.  Alright, Mike.  Hey, Nick, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Alright.  I like your show.  Hey, thank you.  Listen, you guys need a theme song for your show.  Oh, yeah?  I just bought you a show and I have the perfect one.  What is it?  It's a Rolling Stones, the name of the song is Out of Control.  Out of Control? 
[17:30]
 If you listen to the lyrics, it has reference to the homeless, homeless people who are in  the show.  Alright.  We know the song.  Thank you, bro.  Okay.  Alright, man.  Bye.  You were treading on dangerous ground there.  I saw you reaching for the button, Anthony.  Yes.  Miles, you're next on the Opion A show.  I'm going to be the one to get you.

I'm going to be the one to get you.  I'm going to be the one to get you.  show is that it's so damn unpredictable.  You never know what you're going to hear from day to day.  I got to admit the Delta Airlines commercial you guys do was very funny and the nigga trolley 
[21:00]
 spoof you guys did earlier in the week was hilarious.  That wasn't even a spoof.  That was a real deal.  Any chance of getting the Delta Airlines commercial on today?  We'll do it sometime this hour.  I just got to find it or I would do it right now.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I hope you guys live long and prosper.  Thank you, Jack.  All right.  Bye.  Let's find the Delta Homi commercial.  Ben knows where it is, Ben.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[21:30]
 All right.  Listen, the biggest problem with what you guys did yesterday is how do you top that,  which is what the other caller said earlier.  Yeah.  But you got to keep crossing the line just like Anthony did with that bid on his mom which  got him in trouble with his dad's style.  I didn't think you guys were going to be able to cross the line after that one.  You keep finding new ways.  Well, I think Mark's going to attack the NBA, the NBC Today Show next.  Hey.  We've been trying to do something with the Today Show for over a year and a half and 
[22:00]
 I think we finally got our secret weapon in place and ready to go on that one.  Like you guys said, don't worry about your bosses.  Worry about us.  Keep going, guys.  Do a good job.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Bye.  Matt, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  The TV show was awesome, man.  But let me ask you guys a question.  When I watched the replay at 10 o'clock last night on Channel 2, they didn't show it, right?  Of course they're not going to show that.  Why not?  Because what it was was a live stand-up shot for the 5 o'clock news. 
[22:30]
 Oh, so when they showed the replay, they must have edited it out then.  Of course.  Oh, OK.  That was an embarrassment for the TV station.  They're not going to replay that replay.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Peter, you're next.  What's going on?  Peter?  Yeah, hey.  What's up, guys?  All right.  I was watching Channel 4 last night.  It was like the 11 o'clock thing.  And they're just showing a short clip of Hillary getting out of the car. 
[23:00]
 Yeah.  And you can hear Psycho Mark in the background on the bullhorn.  You couldn't have exactly...  Oh, look at you, Kirsten.  You heard Psycho Mark at NBC and it was effing funny.  OK.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You guys rule.  Actually, because I guess Psycho Mark was closer to Hillary than we all realized.  And when she got out of the limo for the Letterman show last night, Mark with the bullhorn yells,  Hillary, show us your fun bags.  Show us your fun bags.  So that sound bite was on every freaking station that was covering the Hillary arrival to Letterman 
[23:30]
 studio yesterday.  Yeah.  So last night when we were watching it again on the news inside, they always have a voice  over over her walking in.  They didn't show the actual sound.  They didn't play the actual sound of her walking into the studio.  Psycho Mark in the studio.  What's up, bro?  I didn't even use the bullhorn for that one.  It was just me standing across the street shrieking my lungs out.  You've got on every TV station with that sound clip.  So that's what I intended to do.  Very good.  Low on A for everybody.  Today's show, Max, bro.  Today's show. 
[24:00]
 Oh, without a dime.  Yeah.  We can't tell them when we're going to hit, but we're going to hit soon, right?  I'm going to bring some sushi.  All right, cool.  Sushi for Al Roker.  That's like such an obscure reference.  No one even got it, man.  That's right.  Dime hard, man.  All right.  Psycho Mark.  He's walking around today like he's a hero, though.  He is.  He's smiling.  He's all happy with himself.  He is a hero.  All right.  We found the Delta homie commercial that that other caller was talking about.  Yeah.  We'll play real fast and we'll go right back to the phone, so stay there. 
[24:30]
 Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you're about to be up off this bitch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something.  You finned to raise up and get your travel on?  From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these  big ass planes.  Shit dog.  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack  on while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch. 
[25:00]
 East coast, west coast, it don't matter.  Nia will get you to your hoe and back lickety splits.  No shit.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff thinking we were some crazy  ass angel.  Hell, these fat round thick ass vessels run up in the sky so deep it beat crying.  Yeah, you thought it was rain.  So bring a towel because if Delta gets laid out like that, call one of these fly ass Delta  coochies and they call them punk ass coworkers of yours. 
[25:30]
 Catch the vapors as you be off and up out.  You go, we fly you there.  You bid, we done all.  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a Jimmy hat.  And Delta, we loves us some flying and it be shown like a mother fucker.  We haven't played that in a while.  Very good.  Let's go back to the phones.  Pete, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey fellas, how you guys doing?  Good.  What's up, man?  First off, I was in the crowd yesterday when your boy Mark had that sign up, man.  I was rolling.  Oh, cool.  I was about 15 feet away from the guy.  I couldn't keep myself.  You know, I couldn't keep myself in the crowd.  I was like, I'm going to go to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  Yeah.  Second off, you guys are talking about that video about the guy in the bleachers. 
[26:00]
 Yeah, that's been around a while.  It's a total scam.  I don't think so.  The guy waves like a fraternity skid.  He waves to the camera at the end of it.  Well, that's fine.  Why?  It's still.  It wasn't like he was busted.  He did it on purpose.  It was a total.  Pete, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Pete, it doesn't matter.  It's cool.  There's a girl getting pounded at a baseball game. 
[26:30]
 It's cool as hell.  I just wanted to go on record and make it to the.  Maybe the girl had no clue.  We knew the whole time.  It doesn't matter.  It's still.  She had no clue.  It's pretty cool to see a couple having sex at a baseball game.  She better believe it.  I don't think it was during the game.  I think it was totally at night and there was like a bunch of frat boys just taking care  of business.  I don't know.  It's a nice clip.  All right.  Listen, you guys are all right.  All right.  Thank you.  Later. 
[27:00]
 Listen, Bobby.  Hey, how are you doing?  Good.  How are you?  Yeah.  I was in the crowd too yesterday and I was laughing my ass off.  That was the funniest bit.  Oh, cool.  I was hoping to see you when I got home, but I didn't.  A friend of mine told me about me.  He saw me in the crowd.  Oh, really?  And I kind of snuck around when Kramer talked to Mark.  Yeah.  You could have fried eggs off the top of her head.  She was so pissed.  We have a little clip of her getting pissed off.  Oh, and she went around to her crew and I kind of inched around and tried to listen.  I couldn't, but she was mad.  She was telling me if they come back, get the cops.  She was mad. 
[27:30]
 The cops wouldn't be able to do anything?  Yeah, I understand, but she was so mad at him.  She said, give me a clear area.  I don't want to be near those guys.  Right.  I got to do this again, but you guys rock.  It was the best scene I've seen in a long time.  I'm doing my newscast.  It was funny.  Believe me.  We were there.  It was funny.  Thank you, Bobby.  Take care, guys.  All right.  We're going to talk about a couple of things today.  Of course.  Lots of new things to talk about today, but this is what's on everyone's mind right now.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on, Opie and Anthony?  All right. 
[28:00]
 I am a new listener now.  That was the funniest damn thing I've ever heard in my freaking life.  I liked it.  All right?  And that convinced you to start listening to the studio show?  Oh, why?  Why?  You guys are the best.  The best at Howard is crap.  You are in Howard is crap.  No, no, no, no.  What, man?  We're trying to get a truce going with Howard right now.  All right, all right, man.  Well, let me just tell you.  They sat me down and talked to me about that today.  You are the best damn thing in the world, all right?  I gotta go, all right?  Thank you. 
[28:30]
 Eddie!  Yeah?  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Yo, I started listening to your show like a week ago.  Yeah.  I just wanted to say yesterday was the most hilarious thing I ever heard.  Thanks.  Anybody?  We had a show before us a week ago.  Huh?  What were you listening to?  Before you started listening to us a week ago?  It was like Hot 97 and all of that garbage.  I used to listen to Howard like a couple of times, but he's like garbage compared to you  too.  You guys kick ass, dude.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you. 
[29:00]
 All right.  Yo, how do I get on that website?  Foundrymusic.com.  That's with the guy in the Sex and the Ballpark?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a bunch of good stuff on there.  Foundrymusic.com?  Yep.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Which is going to reach a million hits sometime tomorrow, Anthony.  A million hits.  A million hits for an underground website for the radio show in less than seven months.  That's pretty amazing.  Jamie!  Yo, congratulations on that million hits, man.  Yeah. 
[29:30]
 Yo, guys, man, last night I'm driving, right?  I'm on the bus.  Oh my God.  These people thought I was mental.  I'm telling you, I got the earplug in my ear and I'm laughing my ass off.  People's eyes are wide open.  What the hell is he going to do?  What is this guy laughing at?  They're saying, oh my God, and today I had a couple of cops on the bus.  Uh-huh.  We started talking.  Yeah.  They said, oh my God, we were rolling.  Oh, cool.  We were listening to that.  So, oh, guys, great job.  Any chance of posting that on the unofficial site?  We're going to try.  We're going to see if we can get away with it.  Clearance, yeah. 
[30:00]
 Oh, guys, you guys are great.  Thank you, Jamie.  All right, man, kick ass.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Do do do do do.  Cliff?  Yo.  You got some info on the baseball clip?  Yeah, if you watch the end of it, the guy hands her some money or he hands her something.  No, it's her panties.  Her panties that were on the floor next to him.  I thought that was the money.  We thought she was the ho or something.  No, it's black panties.  You can tell.  All right.  All right.  Yo, what's the last thing I saw in here is before he closed the can on him.  What?  You fell for it. 
[30:30]
 That was stupid.  I know.  That was really bad.  That was pretty lame.  John, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Gentlemen, how are you doing?  Real good.  Happy New Year to you.  God, I leave town for a couple of weeks and what happens?  A lot of stuff.  Holy crap.  We've been on fire lately.  I know.  Real quick, any repercussions from the big boys?  Did you have to have that meeting this morning?  Honestly, they've been very quiet.  Still in shock.  Yeah, probably.  Sometimes when they're very quiet, it's not a good thing. 
[31:00]
 I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Listen, I meant to propose this toast when I saw you guys at Hooters and let me do that  now.  All right.  A toast.  A toast.  Okay.  Here's to folks like us.  Damn few left.  Is that it?  Well, yeah, sorry.  All right.  I'm sorry about that.  And Anthony, I know I've been bugging you about that picture that we took together.  Right. 
[31:30]
 If you could possibly give that to me, I'd sure appreciate it.  All right, man.  All right, John.  Is that a train?  No.  Joey.  Yes, sir.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Good.  Listen, I saw a tape about a year ago, firemen in New York City.  You know, they always seem to have these great tapes, porno flicks, you know?  There was a whole entire tape that was done supposedly by the cameramen that worked for  each individual team in every city in the country.  And these tapes, this one particular tape had all these scenes where there was sex going 
[32:00]
 on throughout the ballpark all over the country.  And there's a whole tape of that stuff?  Oh, absolutely.  I would love to do that.  Check that out.  So, I got a call from a guy in the city fire department and they were passing it around.  He said that, you know, supposedly the cameramen that worked for the teams knew about this  and there was something where they would zone in on each section on every particular game  and they would find this stuff out.  Of course, because those cameras are so freaking powerful.  And you go to like the top of the bleachers in Shea and you're assuming no one could really  see what you're doing up there, but those cameras could zoom right the F in.  Hell yeah.  And they were picking everything up. 
[32:30]
 And the funny thing was that they would show you that they were actually at the game while  it was going on.  They'd have like a guy pitching the ball to the batter.  That's cool.  To prove that it was an actual game.  So, the guy that called early said it was just a setup.  Now you could actually see it wasn't.  It was an actual game going on while the time this was all happening.  Yeah, I would like to check out the rest of the tape.  That's pretty cool.  If I get a copy of it, a friend of mine had about a year ago.  Right.  I'd be more than happy to send it to you guys.  All right, Joe.  But for all you listeners can see the whole thing.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  All right, guys. 
[33:00]
 Take care.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Hey, Mary, you're next on W-A-D-W.  I was down in DC for New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  And it was kind of cold out.  Towards the end of the show they showed this Spielberg film which kind of brought the crowd  down because there was no music or whatever.  And this guy took off all his clothes and he jumped into the reflecting pond.  And to Amica had the reflecting pond and everybody was cheering and screaming and everybody up  closer thought we were cheering and screaming for the Spielberg film.  And the guy got to the end and then he jumped back in and everybody was high-fiving over 
[33:30]
 him.  And he was running around naked.  And the next morning we were watching on the Discovery Channel or whatever.  I think it was some Discovery or A&E.  I don't know.  But they were showing it.  But it's on film because we were looking at the camera angles and we're like somebody  has a copy of this guy swimming across the reflective film, the reflective pool just  before midnight.  Naked as a jaybird.  And we decided that they probably would.  That must have been cold.  What?  That must have been cold.  Oh, we were cracking up.  The guy was insane. 
[34:00]
 And then we were like, oh, you know, they'll never release this clip because I mean it's  supposed to be really tight security and he never got arrested.  That'll be on the Internet pronto.  Yeah.  I mean, it's out there because we were looking at the camera angles and the way they were  showing the Spielberg film and there was definitely and a camera in that area.  And most cameras work by working nonstop.  Right.  So somebody's got that out there and it is absolutely hysterical.  I mean, the crowd went crazy.  There were no police.  And this is supposed to be like super tight security of this guy is just running around 
[34:30]
 butt naked.  It's just a matter of time before we all get to see that.  Yeah, you got to try to get it.  That it's absolutely hilarious because they'll never release it because it'll reveal too much  that they really lacked of security.  All right, Mary, thank you.  Cool.  I understood this.  I understood the first four times you said that she hypnotized me.  Sean, Sean, you're a new listener, too?  Yeah, I'm a new listener, man.  I just got turned on to you guys about three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago?  That's it, man.  Where were you?  Do you know what you have missed?  I'm telling you, you guys make me piss my pants out. 
[35:00]
 Sorry for saying that, though.  What were you listening to before us?  Nothing.  You just throwing a few CDs on the way home, you know, or whatever.  But I mean, the voices, the mic and the mad dog are hilarious.  Cool.  Cool.  You guys are really cool, though.  We appreciate it.  Enjoy the show.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  All right, let's try to move on to other things, OK?  Of course.  We can start with the Hillary interview on the letter, man.  What did you think, everyone?  What did you think?  What did you think of it?  That snooze fest.  We'll get into that next, OK? 
[35:30]
 All right.  But as we go to commercials, got to thank Jimmy from the production department for putting  together a little montage about yesterday's festivities with Psycho Mark, all right?  All right.  Check this out.  We got channel 2 news on.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  The hugest wow psych.  This is like an act.  Hey, hey, it's a huge toss up.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over. 
[36:00]
 Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  You look like a soccer-raving lunatic.  You can't be doing that.  What the hell, you boys?  You're interrupting our own news broadcast, for God's sake. 
[36:30]
 You know we're going to get in trouble by the company.  Yeah, I know.  out.  I'm very mad at you tell her go to  are you going to be allowed to do your job? I should be allowed to do mine. 
[37:00]
 I almost pissed in my pants. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very very long time.  Mark, I got one question for you. How do you walk around with that set you guys?  I just want to know guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you gotta listen every day. This could be it right here today.  You never know. 
[37:30]
 1027 WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony Shoop. If you have something, 212-757-1027.  We'd like your participation on this radio show.  Yeah. The fax line, 212-957-9639.  As we try to move on with the show, I guess everyone talking about Hillary on Letterman last night. 
[38:00]
 Boring! Dave's a load. Boring!  Just gotta say Dave is a load.  Everyone else in the media kissing Hillary's ass, kissing David Letterman's ass. Boring, contrived.  I don't think Hillary had one word that came out of her mouth that wasn't written for her.  Yeah.  David just like, oh God, he had her right there. David, you had Hillary right there. 
[38:30]
 Ask about her husband. Ask about Monica. Do something. I don't care what you promised them before the interview. Do something.  All he did was kiss her ass, say that she would make a fine senator, as would Rudy.  Boy, if that isn't riding the fence. You can't say both of them would make a good senator.  Right. He said, what did he say? He said that they're both great candidates for the senator.  They're both running and the problem is we're going to lose one good senator out of this. 
[39:00]
 Just lapping her buttocks. Just kissing up.  I mean everybody saw it last night and I was just like, I was expecting so much more from David Letterman. Come on, David.  The truth of the matter is Dave's getting a little old. And it's showing. It really is.  That whole thing he was doing, you know, the government control the weather.  That whole bit that he does and makes the funny faces don't work anymore. That whole act doesn't quite wash anymore. 
[39:30]
 And do you honestly think that test about New York wasn't set up where they gave Hillary all the answers?  I mean obviously a bunch of easy questions but Hillary would have never taken the chance live on the show to answer questions about New York.  No. The whole damn thing was contrived.  Fake, phony, boring. 
[40:00]
 Walter Cronkite.  Dave, don't be a jackass. Let Hillary come on here and interview her and kiss her big fat white ass.  Her butt crack looks like the trenches I was in reporting from the Tech Offensive in Vietnam.  Back in 1968 when the Tech Offensive, when I was in a foxhole that looked just like her big fat ass crack. 
[40:30]
 Just laughing.  If they had any balls at that show, they would have had Rudy Giuliani come out at the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Oh, so they're going to get mad at you that you didn't care?  Bend her over the chair. Start plowing.  Imagine that one.  Dave and Rudy put Hillary on the rotisserie and played cards on her back. Now that's a show.  You know, and I think it's very obvious to everyone that David Letterman really likes Rudy Giuliani. 
[41:00]
 He's been on the show for many, many times in the past.  Yeah.  Very disappointing.  He had to get her on and then he just sucked up to her. That was it. That was the entire friggin' show.  Blue, blue, blue, blue.  All right. Let's see what everyone else is saying about it.  Ah, Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  That interview was lame.  It was completely not her lame.  It was disappointing and then giving her a tractor at the end.  And then she's reading her own top ten list that was obviously written for her. It was just, God, I was so disappointed. 
[41:30]
 It really was.  Ranked up there with like Joan London and Michael Jackson.  Yeah, pretty much. I forgot about that one, sure.  That's an old reference.  All right, Rich.  All right, guys. Take care.  Thank you.  Jason.  Yes, sir.  What's up?  How you doing?  Good.  Man, let me tell you something. They should have had Rudy on the show with her.  Of course.  That would have made it a whole lot better.  I'm sure there were promises made like, look, you know, when Hillary comes on, we don't want you talking about Monica or Bill's infidelity. 
[42:00]
 Exactly.  We don't want any mentions of Rudy, really.  We certainly don't want him to show up on the show.  I'm sure there are all sorts of stipulations.  Yeah.  God, David, if you had balls, you'd just say yes, yes, yes, okay, we won't do any of that. And then you do all of it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You got it.  That's what they were doing. Man, but let me tell you, Letterman, he should have had her right there. 
[42:30]
 He had his whole opportunity to say whatever he wanted to.  Yeah, he blew it.  He blew it, definitely.  I think so.  I think Letterman needs to get out.  You just have to go for it at that point.  Maybe it's a little shaky in there, though. You know, maybe it's a little scary with Secret Service all around.  Yeah.  She's there.  What are they going to do, shoot you for asking a stupid question?  I think it'd be funny to have her walk off your show because she's pissed. That'd make more news.  And the news crews are all outside the studio. Here's Hillary. She's doing a talk show. Oh, boy, who cares? 
[43:00]
 I watched a bunch of editorials this morning back in the office. All the media was kissing her ass.  Oh, we thought she looked terrific. She was so funny and funny. That's another thing. She's saying stuff.  But if you had her in front of you, you wouldn't kiss her ass?  No.  No?  No.  Oh, come on.  In like casual conversations, some of the stuff she was saying might be funny, you know?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden Dave is just cracking up like it is the funniest damn thing ever. 
[43:30]
 And does Paul Schaefer go back to the mothership at night?  Does he go back and just like cruise off to whatever galaxy he's from through the black hole and then come back every day?  Does he commute from his planet or does he live here? Holy mother of pearl, does he look like an alien now?  He should have left the wraparound horseshoe hair that he had for years, which wasn't all that bad.  He lost his hair four years ago. Everyone's known Paul Schaefer as being the bald guy. 
[44:00]
 And he doesn't even speak English anymore.  I don't know what it is.  David asked some stuff. And yeah, just like that.  That's his native language from the planet of Baltar or something.  Mike thought Hillary came off pretty good. Mike?  Really?  Hey, Owen, what's up?  What's up?  What's going on, man?  You liked her on Letterman last night, huh?  I have to say that I actually did. I mean, it was kind of gay. I mean, I admit Letterman was kind of punked out. 
[44:30]
 But I will say this, she came off pretty good. I mean, maybe it was scripted.  Because yeah, that's how it was written for her to come off pretty good.  Pretty much.  She wouldn't have done it unless she came off looking good.  Pretty much every line she said was written for her. And she didn't even rehearse her lines. That part was very obvious.  Come on this show and then see how you come off looking good.  She was a little nervous, you could tell. But I will say this, I mean, wouldn't you rather see her in it than Giuliani? I mean, come on.  Nah, Rudy's pretty funny on this show.  Rudy is funny on there. 
[45:00]
 You see him dressed like a bitch on Saturday Night Live? God damn it's funny.  Yeah, the guy knows how to have fun.  The best thing Giuliani's done for the city is, I think, clean up the subway and clean up the village.  But other than that, I mean, he hates New York nightlife, he hates clubs.  If there's anything that really has anything to do with fun, I notice. He's always raiding nightclubs.  I'm not having any fun. Why should anyone else?  But I don't know, I think it would be kind of interesting to see her in there. I mean, she doesn't seem as phony as I might have thought she did. 
[45:30]
 She's in a different light.  That's her act, is to look not phony. The phoniness of looking not phony.  Yeah, I mean...  I can't stand her. Of course she's a phony. She's living with her husband who she can't friggin' stand. They can't stand each other.  To her, he's just a banging Arkansas slob. You just can't keep it in his pants.  And to him, she's just a power-hungry dyke who's trying to ride his coattails into political office. 
[46:00]
 There you go. There's the relationship in a nutshell. Thank you.  The minute the presidency is over, she's definitely dumping them. I'll say that.  Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Mike, thank you.  Thank you, man. Bye.  I was sitting there watching last night the way I'm going.  You know, if Hillary makes a legit Senate run and she has to reach the young voters...  We would definitely be in the running.  What, to get her on the show?  Yeah. We reach a lot of the young voters.  That's going to happen. Yeah. 
[46:30]
 It's a possibility.  Oh, yeah.  It's a possibility.  Like Clinton playing the sax on MTV and stuff to try to get the young voters.  And I believe Clinton was on I Miss His Show a while ago, like eight years ago when he was first running.  So you think we'd have a shot?  We would have a huge segment of the young voters.  She's got to go on some radio shows.  I'm telling you.  Lesbian couch for Hillary?  Would we do that?  She'd probably jump right on it. 
[47:00]
 Jump right on it.  Give me your face.  I'm on it.  We would have to support her, I believe, if she did a round on the lesbian couch.  Oh, Hillary, look at her.  Screw her. Look at her today. It's Jay Moore.  That's going to try to get your clothes off.  Well, let's get a female point of view on last night.  Marybeth, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  All right.  Listen, I think you guys should interview Hillary Clinton.  You do a lot better job.  Well, that's what we're saying.  We would welcome the opportunity. 
[47:30]
 No, I would tell you what we would do, OK?  What?  They would sit us down, all her people, and say, look, you know, we're going to give you an opportunity of a lifetime.  You get to interview the First Lady about her Senate run.  But you can't mention Monica.  Oh, no.  Can't talk about Bill and his infidelity.  No, no, no.  Can't have Rudy as a surprise guest.  Got to keep the lesbians out of the studio that day.  And you do it all.  Make sure the egg shooter is nowhere near the building.  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  How about old dirty?  You think he'd be allowed in?  Old dirty? 
[48:00]
 Hillary, that's my word.  You got a big butt.  That's a good old man.  Look at that ass.  Come on, kid.  We're going to say Jay Moore has to be in LA.  They'll give us this whole list of things.  And Aunt Nia, like good little boys, like we do, very well off the air, we'll go, yes, sir, yes, sir.  No, no, we wouldn't do that.  No, no, no, no.  No, we won't do that.  OK.  She would come in and we would do it all.  She'd sit down and all of a sudden, hey, hey, whore.  How you doing, you whore?  Where's your husband? 
[48:30]
 Where's his penis?  You ain't seen that in quite a while, have you?  You whore.  That'll be fun.  Some dice to the interview.  All right, Mary Beth.  Hey, guys.  I love you.  You have saved me so many times from road rage.  I deliver pizzas during the day and during the afternoon, and I want to run people over numerous times sometimes.  You deliver pizzas?  Yeah.  Do you deliver to the bad neighborhoods?  No, they won't let me.  Yeah, see?  I saw a TV show on this.  Oh, a lot of the pizza places are getting in trouble now and getting sued. 
[49:00]
 Getting sued for millions of dollars.  I saw that on Dateline.  Yeah.  Really?  Because they're not sending the delivery people to bad neighborhoods.  When you get a phone call from a bad neighborhood, it's like, no, we don't deliver.  Yeah.  And people are suing.  What kind of girl are you?  Describe yourself quickly.  Five-three, brown hair, brown eyes.  How much do you weigh?  Like 120.  Yeah, you're a little girl.  And she's going to go deliver pizza in the hood? 
[49:30]
 You never know what will happen to you.  There's a reason why they started this because a lot of their drivers were being held up  and robbed.  So I think it was in Washington and St. Louis, if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah.  So these pizza chains finally said, look, we are not delivering to these neighborhoods  anymore.  It's not worth it.  Our drivers, their lives are in risk.  Certainly there's a chance of getting robbed and their money stolen.  It's not worth the chance.  Mary Beth would be the only pizza delivery person that leaves with extra sausage. 
[50:00]
 You go to that neighborhood, you never know.  Ready for this one, though, Ann?  So then another pizza company decided, OK, we'll continue delivering in the bad neighborhoods,  even though we've had some serious trouble.  But we're going to make the people meet us outside to make the exchange.  That company is now getting sued for trying to do the right thing as well.  Yeah, like they had to walk up to the car.  Like a drug deal.  Like when you see cops and they're selling crack, like they go into the neighborhood 
[50:30]
 and the guy comes up with the crack and they sell it through the car window.  That's exactly what the pizza deal looked like.  You know what you need.  I got it.  What you need.  A little anchovy.  And I'd like to say, go UConn, all right?  All right.  I go there and I'm deprived of you guys in the wintertime.  I hate it.  UConn has a just sick team once again this year.  Yeah, well, we're number five now.  Well, you guys are going to be right there at the end again.  You think?  Well, St. John's. 
[51:00]
 Come on, baby.  St. John's.  Yeah, this is 16th.  Come on.  Who are you cheering for?  St. John's.  What?  I'm in New York or not?  I'm not from Connecticut.  Well, I'm not either.  But, you know, I got to cheer for my school.  I went to the St. John's, yeah, St. John's UConn game last year at the Garden.  And I was really pissed off because there were more Connecticut fans there than New York  fans.  Oh, yeah.  We support our team.  Our home court.  And all I heard was Connecticut cheering like a mother.  Oh, we are loud.  Yeah, I don't know much about any basketball, especially college. 
[51:30]
 But one thing I do know, the UConn fans are crazy.  We are crazy.  All right, Mary Beth.  Let me tell you.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  As crazy as you can get in Connecticut.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, let's be real here.  All right.  We'll take a few more calls on the Hilary Letterman thing, and we'll move on to other things.  So stay right there.  You guys can come play.  Piss me off, OK?  One, oh, two, seven, WNEW. 
[52:00]
 How annoying that must be for our listeners.  Prodigy.  Come in and we're just like yelling at the music.  One, oh, two, seven, WNEW.  The O.P. and Anthony Shue.  Yes.  Having a lot of fun taking your phone calls.  Yeah.  Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven. 
[52:30]
 Talking about Hilary and David Letterman.  Yes.  Seems like everyone stayed up to watch that last night.  Oh, brother.  Great.  I'm surprised to see Walter Cronkite still alive.  Walter Cronkite.  My mere first lady, Hilary Clinton.  I remember when I was with Eleanor Roosevelt.  Bent the row of the couch in the Lincoln bedroom.  Dave, remember?  What, did he have a big old hearing aid in his head?  Had a huge hearing aid.  Like, does he need a big huge one? 
[53:00]
 He's Walter Cronkite.  Can't you get one of those little ones that go in the ear?  But look like I have a satellite receiver in my head.  And then Dave's going, wow, didn't Walter Cronkite look great?  What?  What, Dave?  What, who are you, Jay Leno?  I can't hear you.  Don't say anything stupid.  He called him a jackass.  Dave, you're a jackass.  Joey!  Walter Cronkite.  What's up?  What's up, O&A?  Talking to you.  Hey, man.  Thinking, thinking, Hilary's real hot, bro. 
[53:30]
 What?  Got a thing for her.  Wow, you're effed up.  Yeah, you got to get some of that laser surgery on your eyes, man.  Come on, man.  You're wrong.  A little secret thing with Hilary?  That's wrong.  Most powerful woman in the world?  Dude, she's a weeble.  Anyone else notice that?  She's not the most powerful woman in the world.  Oh, my God.  She wields nothing.  She wishes she had a schlong and she doesn't.  Come on, tell the truth.  You won't want to see a buck naked. 
[54:00]
 Ugh.  As part of a cottage cheese ass.  Let me answer him, Joey.  Joey, as part of a freak show, sure, I would love to see her naked.  Those big, tree trunk legs of hers.  Like in Celebrity Skin magazine or something.  All of a sudden you see her.  That's what I'm talking about.  She is a weeble.  Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down.  I mean, her body's like this, right here, and then it goes, whoa.  She's got a big old way.  I'm thinking she's hot.  I'm thinking she's wild.  I'm thinking you're stoned. 
[54:30]
 Jesus, man, what are you, insane?  Of all the chicks you could say are hot that have been on TV.  My wife thinks I'm sick, dude.  You are.  I believe you are, too.  All right, Joey, get out of here.  This is your guy's rule, man.  All right, go do another bong hit.  Later.  Obviously, he's got something in his eyes.  Ralph.  He thinks that big fat cottage cheese ass.  Hey, Ralph, you still there?  I'm absolutely here.  Sorry to make you wait a while.  What's up?  That's no problem. 
[55:00]
 It just proves to me how stupid the voters in New York are.  Hillary comes on TV and everyone's into her.  And now the polls go up.  Right.  Why do the polls go up?  Just because she does a TV show.  Yeah, who changes their mind?  Haven't you made your opinion by now?  She's on TV.  I like her now.  Right.  She did Dave.  And then Rudy will be on maybe in another month or so.  And then his ratings will go up and hers will drop.  That's what it is, ratings.  It's popularity.  Listen to your listeners today.  They're saying how great she was and they like her.  It was fake.  They can't see it.  And now all of a sudden, Rudy's a bad guy. 
[55:30]
 The sad part is it's working for her.  You know, as voters, we are so fickle.  I mean, the average person doesn't know anything about the issues.  And we're just like, oh, wow, she did great on Letterman last night.  I'm going to vote for her now.  Well, that's her husband won.  He played the sax.  Hey, man, that guy must be great.  I'll tell you something.  You know what the problem was with Adolf Hitler?  No TV talk shows.  The guy probably would have had like fans.  He probably would have, you know, could be Hitler doing Dave. 
[56:00]
 There'd be calls the next day.  Hey, you seem like a really fun guy.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  It's just getting your face on TV.  That's it.  You would have some stupid human tricks.  Oh, God, Ralph.  I want to have my guest Adolf Hitler.  You know, he comes goose stepping out on today's couch.  All I know about Adolf Hitler and we've said in the past, yeah, he's wrecked that mustache look for everyone.  The little mustache will never come back. 
[56:30]
 You cannot wear that look.  Oh, you occasionally see the Van Dyke, don't you?  You see the goatee?  Sure.  You see the handlebar mustache with the guy that waxes the ends?  Oh, yeah.  Looks real stupid, but you still see it.  You even see some people walking around with the mutton chops.  The big mutton chop sideburns and stuff.  There's every style of hair on people's face you could dream of except one, the little Hitler mustache.  For one man to ruin an entire little look like that, that's something. 
[57:00]
 That's saying something.  Because before Hitler, I mean, a bunch of people wore the mustache.  Charlie Chaplin.  Charlie Chaplin comes to mind, sure, and many others.  But since then, what if you just know you look better that way?  What if you want it to look?  You cannot walk down the streets of New York with that look.  Could you see just walking into the office, how you doing, Bob?  Right.  Hey, Tom, how you been?  And you have like the Hitler mustache.  I'm going for a new look here today.  You're automatically labeled an anti-Semite.  Yeah, you would be like Hitler.  But what if you just wanted to wear the mustache because you look good? 
[57:30]
 You just want to bring that look back.  That's directed for everyone.  Maybe we ought to try to bring that back.  Oh, yeah.  Are you willing to grow the Hitler mustache?  No, no, no.  With me?  No, see.  I'll do it?  No.  Walk around with the Hitler.  You'd get looks instantly.  You wouldn't get just looks.  You would get just beat up.  Like if it wasn't for Hitler, you'd be walking down the street and maybe pass dozens of people in a day with the Hitler mustache look.  Just like when the Derby hat was hot. 
[58:00]
 Right.  Everyone you passed had the Derby hat on.  A little Derby hat.  And who knows, that might come back someday.  There hasn't been anything really that has crushed that look.  But the Hitler mustache, ooh, you know, years later.  We should have Psycho Mark put the mustache on and walk around like times.  Psycho Mark, grow the Hitler mustache.  Can he grow a mustache?  I haven't looked at his potential for facial hair.  I don't know.  All right, he can grow the Hitler mustache and then walk around the city and we can see the reactions that people get. 
[58:30]
 Our phones crashed out again, Spaz?  God damn, I would love that.  I would love to see that.  I think we have to update our phone system.  We're starting to get so many calls, we're blowing out the system every day.  Again?  Yeah.  I mean, you could still call the show, but our communications between us and Spaz has broken down once again, Andrew.  Jesus H. Christ.  Oh, we can't type in the...  No, it's okay.  Pamela, you're next.  Hi, how are you doing?  Good.  Hey, I remember a few months back when you invited Hillary to your show. 
[59:00]
 And if you keep on talking about her like that, calling her a wee-bolt, she's not going to come.  Well, we don't really care either way.  You don't care if she comes to the show?  No.  No, we don't care.  I mean...  Like she would even do this show.  Yeah, the odds are small.  Jesus.  I'm hoping to get Rudy on.  That would be great.  We'd have Rudy on tomorrow.  Okay, call Rudy.  See if he'll come.  We had Mayor Kach on when we first got here.  He wasn't very thrilled with us.  I think you two are not real broadcasters.  Shut up, you fossil.  We had to cut the interview short.  He wasn't into us at all.  He was cool with us. 
[59:30]
 He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us. 
[60:00]
 He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us. 
[60:30]
 He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  He was cool with us.  I was everywhere but New York.  Oh, you should have been here.  I'd take the best years to be in Western New York working on my radio career.  No, man.  You should have been here during the Dinkins years.  I was paying attention.  I was glad.  That was some of the funny...  It was like a bizarro world.  You know when everything's in reverse? 
[61:00]
 Sure.  That's how it was.  It was insane.  And then every day I'd be in my truck working and click on WLIB, the black station, when  Dinkins was in on...  They're having like Mardi Gras parties in that station every day that Dinkins is in.  A drug dealer shoots a cop.  Dinkins goes to the drug dealer's hospital bed.  Jesus, it was bizarro world.  You're right.  It was bizarro world.  It was bizarro world.  Holy mother of pearl. 
[61:30]
 And then when he lost the election to Giuliani, I turned on WLIB and there I'm in mourning.  It's over, my brothers and sisters.  Our reign is over.  It was good while it lasted.  Yeah.  I want a recamp.  They were freaking out, but the Dinkins years, oh my God.  That's very funny.  Bob Grant on the radio always banging heads with them.  Dinkins.  Dinkins is a washroom attendant.  He called them a washroom attendant.  And when they were rioting with the Jews, a bunch of savages. 
[62:00]
 God, what a fun time.  Bob Grant.  Jonathan, you're next on WNEW.  Hey guys, how are you?  Listen, we don't want her on our show.  Wait, I like how you just said that.  I like how you just said, we don't want her on our show.  You guys are like the 11th man. 
[62:30]
 You know how they do that at football stadiums?  It's your show too.  It's your show too.  You're the 11th man.  And her issue with the homeless.  Listen, I live in Jersey.  When I worked in New York, high school in New York, everywhere I went there was a bomb.  You go into an ATM machine, the homeless doors open you and then they got their hands out  waiting for you.  I know, how stupid are they?  I don't want to see it.  I don't want to see it.  And I don't want to smell it.  They don't know what they're talking about.  Yeah, I mean Rudy's done a great job with that. 
[63:00]
 As far as I'm concerned Rudy is a hero.  A couple of years ago he went against some Democrat.  Actually he was for a Democrat and I thought he was a hero for that.  He went against his own party for that.  And I got a lot of respect for the guy.  Right.  I think he's done a real good job for the city.  And I'm not a New Yorker but I really respect the guy and I like what he's done.  We want Rudy on this show.  We want Rudy.  We want Rudy on my show.  Alright.  On my show.  Thank you John. 
[63:30]
 My pleasure.  Take care.  Bye.  You can't do something for the good of your city if you're the mayor like that.  Like he is.  And make everyone happy.  You're going to piss off a lot of people.  Me personally I think he ought to throw the cops some cash.  Of course.  The guy's been holding out on the cops.  You know the crime's down and everything like that.  What is it?  Rudy out on the streets?  I'm patrolling with my comb over.  It's not him.  The cops are out there.  With his Simon Bar Sinister hat.  Simon Bar Sinister. 
[64:00]
 I'll rule the city.  Make crime drop and close the booby bars.  Where's the Rudy rap?  We've got to play the Rudy rap.  Ask Baz.  He'll find it.  But you're going to piss off a lot of people.  He pissed me off with the closing up the booby bars and everything and the peep shows.  Well that person earlier made a good point.  He's not for nightlife basically.  Yeah.  He's not about fun.  He's not about fun.  He's not in it.  He's into bringing revenue into the city.  And boy he's done that.  Right. 
[64:30]
 And you could walk down the streets.  You don't see as much crap as you used to.  And you know something?  Quite frankly I don't care where it went.  A lot of people are like, well where did they go?  Where did the homeless go?  I don't know.  Well there's a point you've got to bring up too though.  What?  The economy.  Yeah.  When the economy's good your city's in pretty good shape.  Right.  Because there's money to pump in.  There's more jobs.  So everyone moves up the ladder a notch.  Because everyone is bowing to Clinton's presidency.  The fact is the economy's been absolutely on a roll since he's been in office. 
[65:00]
 And that helps your stature.  Yes it does.  And does he have anything to do with the economy?  No.  Alan Greenspan does.  Isn't he going to talk Monday or something?  There goes the stock market.  I don't know.  Some about interest rates.  Might raise them.  That'd blow.  John?  Yeah, hey old B Anthony.  What's up?  How are you?  Alright.  Alright I had two things I wanted to point out. 
[65:30]
 First of all, Ludderman is horrible now.  He totally sucks.  Well we were disappointed in his performance last night.  I hope he's not in his office today patting himself on the back.  Because he looked like a puss.  He has his wig on you think or not?  He's got to reinvent himself I think.  What about that hair?  The hair?  He lost it.  He's losing it.  I know.  It happens to guys every day.  It's so bad now it looks like a rug is on his head all the time.  Well they showed when Pataki was on.  Only a couple of years ago.  Not that long ago.  Yeah it was a few years ago. 
[66:00]
 Like four years ago?  Yeah about that.  And he looked so much younger.  I mean that was a rough four years for Dave.  Well he's got to grow his hair out a little bit.  If you grow your hair out it kind of you know,  it comes up some of that space that's on your forehead.  It's too like cut close.  He just went for the mighty fine there.  Exactly.  And another thing I wanted to touch on,  that girl that was talking about the...  The girl who was the pizza delivery girl.  I have a funny story too about how people sue restaurants. 
[66:30]
 My cousin lives down in Florida and he worked at one of the little Caesar type places down there.  And what happened was a couple of yams came in and started harassing all the workers.  Oh my God.  So they all went in the back and they pissed in the pizza sauce.  And what they did was the company ended up getting sued.  Because somehow they ended up seeing these kids in the back pissing in the sauce.  Well you can't do that.  Well they went and harassed all the workers and they ended up peeing in their pizza. 
[67:00]
 Right.  Alright man.  And the company got sued.  There you go.  Thank you John.  No problem.  Have a great day guys.  Alright.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to reboot the phones, get them working right.  Alright.  As we go to break, it's the Rudy rap.  We haven't played this in a while.  No.  Check it out.  Let me taste it.  Yeah you taste that bitch.  Let me taste it.  I'm a bad mother f***er.  Lord Como.  Let me taste it.  Mm hmm.  The spicy cheese.  That's right.  I'm Rudy G. I'm here to say.

[69:00]
 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sam's on the phone here.  Sam, what's up?  Sam, I'm sorry.  Ah, well, he has Sam down, sorry.  Ah, well, it's bad.  It's bad.  Anthony, I'm only 21, but you got me nostalgic talking about the Dinkins, Iron Man.  Yeah.  How crazy it was in New York back then.  It was insane.  Things were so much more interesting.  It was so much fun to pick up the daily news in the Post on a daily basis.  Do you remember how the cops used to have those demonstrations against Dinkins and Giuliani 
[69:30]
 would be there with them?  Yeah.  Bunch of drunk cops living there.  So it's like...  They leave our cops alone.  It was so much fun back then.  Times Square was so much more sleazier back then.  You had the dirty old men on the corner and no more peep shows.  Things weren't interesting anymore.  But when you used to drive in with your parents and stuff, your parents would be all embarrassed  because you'd just be passing big movie theater marquees saying,  Suck Sluts and come in for Dancing Girls. 
[70:00]
 We'll do this.  And it's all just spelt out on the screen.  You had the pimps on the sidewalks.  Yeah, the random acts of violence every day.  Gunshots, crack dealers.  Yeah.  You drive by the Javits Center.  It was just whores, whores, whores.  Everywhere.  You don't have those open air drug markets anymore, man.  It's so much harder to get a piece of crack rock these days.  Yeah.  It's like a different city.  It was so much fun.  It was very entertaining back then.  I'll tell you that much.  It was an adventure coming into Manhattan.  They didn't know if you were leaving. 
[70:30]
 The only thing that Giuliani and Dinkins have in common is that cops hate both of them.  He used to bash Dinkins.  Now he bashes Giuliani.  I hate all of them.  Oops, my ticker's going again.  How am I doing?  All right, guys.  All right, Sam.  Yeah, those were some fun times, the Dinkins years.  Sam remembers.  It was nice to check that out from afar, Ed.  Yeah.  I was missing an action those years. 
[71:00]
 Just what an embarrassment, I think.  The first black mayor of New York City.  An achievement for blacks.  I mean, an achievement.  It's the biggest city in the world, the pinnacle of the free world.  I mean, we're right here, New York City, black mayor, and he completely dropped the ball.  I mean, completely dropped the ball.  If he had Clintonitis, if the polls weren't up, he was pissed and trying to figure out a way to change him around.  Rudy doesn't care. 
[71:30]
 He'll have an idea.  No matter how twisted or ass-backwards it is, he has it, he's committed to it, and he'll do it.  He follows it through.  Regardless of who calls him an ass for doing it, who hates him for doing it, doesn't matter.  I'm following through.  Close shot of a movie bike.  Yeah.  You know, he pisses people off, but he does it.  Dinkins, like, uh-oh, now what?  Oh, oh, no, the polls are down.  What do I do?  Oh, I'll go to the drug dealer's bed.  Oh, my community's all pissed at me because a cop shot a drug dealer, and the cop is dead.  The drug dealer's still alive. 
[72:00]
 Oh, I better go to the drug dealer's bedside, Reverend Al, and meet with his family.  It was like a wacky sitcom.  It was.  It was bizarro world where everything was backwards.  Remember that, Superman?  It's good times with Dinkins.  It was crazy, but damn interesting.  The whole Tawana-Brawley thing was going on, wasn't it, during the Dinkins years, too?  You just see Reverend Al every Tuesday, Tawana-Brawley.  Wipe and you fall.  Tawana-Brawley. 
[72:30]
 She went, find me an X-Gammon on her.  And raise your lamp of hoots.  Written all over about it.  David Dinkins, I want an investigation about Tawana-Brawley.  Steven Begonis and a bunch of police officers gang-banged Tawana-Brawley.  And wrote the word nigger on her.  And spread X-Gammon on her and threw her in a plastic garbage bag.  And he didn't check out the stories from the neighbor who saw Tawana crawling into a garbage bag herself. 
[73:00]
 I don't hear that.  Dinkins is in the background, nodding his head.  Yeah, yeah, we're looking into it. If the polls say I should look into it, I'll look into it.  What a cluster F that was.  C. Vernon Mason, Alton Maddox, and Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Larry, Moe, and Curly of the black community.  Those are some fun times, man.  Hallelujah. 
[73:30]
 Good times.  I am Al Brees.  Tawana.  And remember the news clip of Tawana-Brawley?  Reverend Al figures it's good to get loose.  Tawana was being quiet the whole time.  Figures they're finally going to let Tawana make a statement.  Because Reverend Al, Maddox, and Mason are catching so much heat that Tawana will make a statement.  Her statement? No one manipulates me or my family.  That's right. 
[74:00]
 You know how it came out?  No one nipsnaps me or my family.  I swear to Christ, it came out, no one nipsnaps me or my family.  Get the tape.  I was on the floor wetting myself.  I swear to God, I wet myself.  I was laughing so hard.  You were sucking on your thumb, you were laughing so hard.  They finally let her make a statement. Nipsnaps.  Nipsnaps.  God damn, bring me back. That was fun.  Kids, don't forget, later on, what did we learn on the show today?  We learned how to say nipsnates. 
[74:30]
 But man, those were the days.  Wow, very good.  Let's go to Dan real fast. Dan, you're on WNEW.  He was.  Dan waited all that time, hangs up on the air.  Okay, Brian, what's up?  Hey, hello, how are you?  What's up?  Yeah, I was in detention yesterday.  Yeah.  And I was listening to you guys, like, under my foot.  So were we, after the show.  We were in detention.  Yeah, I know. 
[75:00]
 Yeah, and I was in there listening to my radio,  without the teacher looking at me with my hood on,  and I started dying.  I was kicking the table. I was dying listening to the show.  When the guy was out there screaming around,  show us your fun bags.  Psycho Mark, show us your fun bags.  We created a star yesterday, Psycho Mark.  Yeah, now I have two weeks more detention because I was fucking.  Oh well, it was worth it, right?  Yeah, hell yeah. You guys are awesome.  All right, thank you. Bye.  Kim says her parents say Nip Snakes all the time. 
[75:30]
 Kim?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, man?  I was going to school at the New Pulse when that whole thing happened.  Yeah.  And it was just outrageous.  You know, there was just Rachel fights and everything.  And the first time she ever made that statement, we laughed so hard.  It could be the funniest thing I've ever heard on the news.  No one Nip Naked me or my family.  My mother, my sister, and I still say that 10 years ago.  Really?  It is just, I will never forget it.  Anytime I hear the word manipulates, I always think Nip Snakes. 
[76:00]
 No one Nip Snakes me or my family.  No, one night my sister and I were out at a bar and some guy was giving me a hard time.  Yeah.  She got in his face and she's about five foot, about a hundred pounds.  She got in his face and said, no one Nip Naked me or my family.  It's too much. I can't believe you guys remembered that. You guys rock.  No, it's better than I because I don't remember that.  That was a highlight of the Tawana Brawley incident.  I need to find the footage of that. 
[76:30]
 The Wapidon Falls Teen Tawana Brawley.  I'm telling you. And then like, you know, when they had the guy, Pagonis, just up on, you know, out just before and they had Tawana out,  soon as I saw her, that's the first thing I thought of.  I'm so glad somebody else remembers that.  I'm sure a lot of New Yorkers remember that one, man. That was too damn funny.  You guys suck. Take care.  All right. Thank you, Kim.  Bye, guys. Bye.  David, you're next on the program. What's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, listen, you know, the Tawana thing, I came to remember Bill Cotty being involved in this whole thing, too. 
[77:00]
 Didn't he donate a lot of money to handle her legal charges and stuff?  Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of blacks came to the table for her until they realized, oh, my God, this is a sham.  And it's being handled by just three cooks.  Alton Mason and Mason and Maddox and that friggin' Al Sharpton.  Absolutely.  And that was the good old days of Al Sharpton when he used to wear the sweats and the big Volkswagen hubcap medallion around his chest. 
[77:30]
 Well, he had to be in there with the people, you understand.  I'm with my peeps.  It was the Mod Squad.  The Mod Squad. Look at me.  I put Dapper in my sweatpants and my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion.  Thank God I was wearing it when that racist went to stab me that day.  Remember that? And Reverend Howell got stabbed? Those were some great times.  Yeah, but then they went to the bedside of the guy who stabbed him, I think, didn't they?  Yeah.  I'll go to your bedside.  And listen, you guys have got to time some of this stuff. You're going to pull it on television. 
[78:00]
 What's almost our fucking traffic jam.  We don't know when the hell that stuff happens, man.  The next one for Psycho Mark, we've got a couple things in the works, one we can't even mention.  Well, let's see what happens when the eyes open.  It may happen next week and then hopefully the Today Show in the near future.  I'm going to have to start leaving work earlier, I guess.  All right, David.  Take it easy, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  And after that rap, now we've got to play the Reverend Howell song.  Ah, yes. And we'll be back. 
[78:30]
 Reverend Howell, well, he's having off his people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his head's full of grease. 
[79:00]
 You hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with the actions like a boss.  He's Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  He's your pal, Reverend Howell.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me? 
[79:30]
 Then the Bernie gets in the brawly case.  Turn on the TV, you would always see his face.  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network do with the family by his side.  Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  He's your pal, Reverend Howell.  All the never-ending talks for something of this to be.  Why is the white man always picking on me? 
[80:00]
 Reverend Howell.  I'm Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  I'm Reverend Howell.  He's on his ground.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Not as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Howell.  I'm Reverend Howell.  He's Reverend Howell.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Howell.  He's Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  He's the race-based white, ain't a bag of bologna.  Now why is the white man always picking on me? 
[80:30]
 Reverend Howell.  Yeah, I'm Reverend Howell.  He's Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Howell.  Reverend Howell.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Doody Doody.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  OK, yeah, that's the way.  107-WNEW.  He can't seem to stay out of the ring.  We got challenges in his mind.  Got a megaphone and something to sing.  There's more, there's more.  Causing trouble on CBS 2.  With the hugest wows like Munchy Kramer is a tight-ass shrew.  This is like an archipelago mom.  He's a freak.  There he is!  It's time for you to draw a sign.  Move over, move over!  I'm going to get you. 
[81:00]
 I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  Move over, move over!  Yeah!  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS writers got the party.  You look like a stock-raising lunatic.  Classic!  Mark can't be doing that!  What the hell are you doing?  Did you just say something?  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you. 
[81:30]
 I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  I'm going to get you.  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company.  Yeah, I know.  Take them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Watch your face.  She's very mad at me.  You tell her go to our boss.  No, are you doing your job?  More or not.  I'm hanging out.  If you could be allowed to do your job, I could be allowed to do mine.  I almost can't. 
[82:00]
 I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office.  I'm going to go to the office. 
[82:30]
 I want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you got to listen every day.  This could be it right here today.  You never know.  Opie.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of putz.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  We're back on the Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Our listeners are on to us, Anthony. 
[83:00]
 What?  Greg on the Instant Feedback from Jersey.  We just took a musical break, what, about 10 minutes ago?  Yeah.  A musical break to regroup?  Who are you guys kidding?  The market's closed and you want to check your stock.  Ah.  And who were we on the phone with during the break?  Who called up?  Our old buddy, Stock Broker Dave.  Stock Broker Dave finally checking in.  We've got to have him in here again.  He's done a lot for the show, a good friend of the show.  He should call back so we can talk about stocks because he told us some stuff off, you know, 
[83:30]
 I don't know how much of it we can repeat.  It doesn't matter if he says it, you know, he's just on the, I don't know.  Well, that's why I don't want to say anything.  I mean, not like he's doing anything illegal, but no.  There's all sorts of rules between the stock market and broadcasting and all that crap, so we don't...  Yeah.  You can't go on the air, I'm sure, and puff up a stock you're holding, you know?  People are getting in trouble with websites.  Like, there's message boards and all kinds of bulletin boards for every stock out there. 
[84:00]
 You go onto, like, the CNBC site and you could get a message board for any company.  There are people that just buy a crap load of these $5 stocks, just load up on them,  then go on the message boards and put a link there to a page that looks like a legitimate brokerage  firm page, and then they trash the stock, just trash it, and people sell it. 
[84:30]
 They sell off.  It's a sell-off.  Well, they talk it up and they buy the crap out of it, and then the people that own it,  that own the site, sell it at a profit.  That's brilliant.  And they're getting in, like, huge trouble.  You can't do that.  That's brilliant, Doug.  You get screwed for that.  Now, the phones are busted again.  Again?  Why does it happen?  Why does it happen?  They work fine during the songs and spots.  I think it's good news, though, for the show.  It just means the show's growing and we're blowing out the phones now.  It's Y2K, Opie. 
[85:00]
 Yeah, sure.  You see me with my computer in the back office now?  I see that.  I ran to a CompUSA.  What did Aunt get?  Video card and some memory.  I'm playing Half-Life on a 12-inch monitor.  Jesus Christ.  Opie's checking mail on, like, a 19-inch beautiful monitor.  My system that I use is a monster.  Yeah.  And all I'm doing is checking message boards and answering all our listeners back.  I got my chitty-chitty bang-bang computer over there. 
[85:30]
 Like, smoke is coming out of it.  I'm kicking it to get the CD-ROM door to open up.  There's smoke, I swear, coming out of it.  It's making noises.  You got to climb to the top of this building and crank it up a little bit  so you can get another 10 minutes of Half-Life.  I do.  I got to put green in it because the squirrel that's running in the cage  has to run faster inside the computer.  It's an old Packard Bell piece of crap.  Before I learned Dell, it's the way to go.  But yeah, I put a video card in and some memory. 
[86:00]
 Oh, and it looks great on the postage stamp monitor.  So I know what's going to happen next.  I need a monitor.  Time for Aunt to get another monitor, for God's sake.  How much money have you spent on computer equipment in the last year?  In the last year.  Whew.  A few grand there.  Easily, right?  It's going to be, yeah, like what, four maybe?  Probably four.  I love technology.  I love computers.  I got to have everything.  That's it.  Tony, you're a cop.  I was working on the show.  I got the side of my computer open. 
[86:30]
 I'm pulling boards out.  It's like, what the hell are you doing?  I got to put this in now.  I don't give a crap as long as you're funny between two and seven.  Who cares what you do, man?  Pull out all the boards you want.  Tony, you're next on the radio show.  What do you have?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Well, yeah, you know, I heard you guys talking about, you know, knocking Hillary.  Like, I'm not going to vote for her.  You know, she's not my cup of tea or anything like that.  But you got to knock Giuliani, too.  You know, I mean, you guys said it.  I mean, it doesn't pay the cops enough money.  I'm a Port Authority cop. 
[87:00]
 Well, all you guys are going to vote for Giuliani just to get him out of the city out here?  Yeah, well, we just wanted to get out, period.  You got your Port Authority?  Are you even under Giuliani?  No, no, no.  We work, our boss is the governor.  Yeah, you guys are different.  Yeah, we were governed actually by Pataki and Whitman.  Yeah.  He's our boss, you know.  We don't work for Giuliani, but he hates us.  He hates anything having to do with Port Authority. 
[87:30]
 What's that?  He hates anything having to do with Port Authority, Giuliani.  Big time.  I want control of the airports.  He's like, you know what he does?  He wants the airports and it's all Port Authority.  No, you know what he's like to me?  He reminds me like, you know, when you watch pro wrestling, he's like that wrestler was a good guy, then he turned to be a bad guy.  You don't see that chair coming behind your back, you know, and he's like a blind sidekick.  That's how he is.  I mean, during the Dinkins era, he was out there protesting with the cops and this and that, and then he came there. 
[88:00]
 He like totally turned his back on everybody.  Yeah, he should take better care of the cops.  That's obvious.  I mean, for what they've done for the city, he's taken a hell of a lot of credit for it.  I mean, he can't do a speech about the job he's done without bringing up how much crime has dropped and how safe are the streets are.  Well, who's doing that, Rudy?  Toss him a dime or two, you know?  I mean, I'm telling you, if you had him up there, if you got him on your show and you asked him, you'd say, well, you know, what do you think of these Port Authority cops? 
[88:30]
 He'll start backtracking like you wouldn't believe.  I'm pretty sure of it.  Well, but I think it's time to have the mayor on our show.  I'm sure it is.  Well, he does broadcast on CBS.  I mean, I would love it if you guys had him on.  Ask the mayor. Ask the mayor.  Goddamn, that show is great.  We'll do ask the mayor on our show.  Ask the mayor.  I mean, really, I would love to have him on.  Like, if you guys had him on, I would love to be on the phone talking to him.  Hey, man, what do you think?  Well, you guys would ask most of the questions.  What the hell?  I would get like kinnison on him, you know? 
[89:00]
 I would be like, say it.  What do you think of the Port Authority?  He's made no bones about it.  He can't stand the Port Authority cops.  You know?  I mean, we can't stand him.  All right, Tony.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  All right.  Phones are busted, so now we just got to randomly go to them.  This is good.  Uh-oh.  Who's this?  It's Steve.  How are you?  Hi, Steve.  What do you have?  You know, you guys were talking about computer monitors.  I had a monitor that was like since 1990, and that sucker was trying hard to stay alive, 
[89:30]
 and then it just burst into sparks.  Monochrome.  Nothing better than that.  It blinked out on me, and I had to go back and rush like crazy, keep myself calm, and  unplug everything so I wouldn't like spark at myself.  The thing was smoldering as I took it outside.  That's great.  There's nothing better than something bursting into flames in your house.  It makes you happy.  Yeah.  Now you've got to get a new one.  I already got a new one.  I already bought it the same day, but I went to a place where the guy barely spoke English  and tried to sell me like a $225 monitor for like, you know, it was insane. 
[90:00]
 So I just went all around the place.  I got a really good 17-inch monitor.  Very good.  So I'll check it out.  I'll download all the stuff and go to the site.  Where did you try to get the monitor?  On like Broadway?  No, actually, the Monochrome.  Where they sell all that crap, you know, 10,000 times the actual worth?  Binoculars, my friend.  Binoculars.  These are $100 binoculars, and they're like the little things you get out of the gumball  machine.  $100 coated lenses.  Coated with what?  Get out of here.  The prices, they just...  Yeah.  They just rake you over the coals.  Walkman, it's like, wait a minute.  What happened to the price from the time I looked at it in the window in front of the 
[90:30]
 place and I walked in to buy it?  Yeah.  Walkman, $5.  Walk in, $500.  $500.  You did not see a decimal.  You can barter with those guys pretty good.  And you're still going away getting ripped off.  You're going to get ripped off.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Because you bought those binoculars when you first moved back to New York because we had  to check out all the chicks across the way from our hotel.  Yeah, they put us up in a hotel.  It was right across from an apartment.  It was a hotel.  It was a hotel.  It was a hotel.  It was a hotel.  It was a hotel.  Yeah, they put us up in a hotel.  It was right across from an apartment building.  We needed binoculars.  We're in New York.  Broadway is the only place where we could get binoculars. 
[91:00]
 So we're walking around.  I walk in.  You get these little phantom binoculars, little ones.  The guy wanted $90 for them.  $90 for binoculars.  You get it.  Gotta go to Moons.  You get it.  It's like $5.  Cheaper binoculars.  I'm like, get out of here.  I go to walk out.  My friend, my friend.  All of a sudden I'm a friend.  My friend, my friend.  We can work it out.  My friend, how much you want to pay?  You want to pay like $10, I'll give you.  $20.  Now I'm thinking, all right, he went from $90 to $20.  This is crap.  He's still making a profit.  He's not going to go, okay, I'm going to give him at a price where I'm going to lose $50. 
[91:30]
 No, he's still making a profit.  And you ended up buying him for like $20.  And he was pissed off that he was giving it to you at that price.  He was pissed.  So I said $10, and then he said $20.  I said $15.  He said $18.  And then he said $20.  And then he said $20.  And then he said $20.  And then he said $20.  I said $15.  $18.  $15.  $17.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.  $18.

 No.  Being here looking at a video of C म avoided games training for most kind of  youth that was easier to run off the hook.  The right hand you my, this isn't another game you're run off of anyway.  It's another祖-the-  You want it?  Because we're not saying like, uh-huh, yeah.  We're doing something else. 
[98:00]
 We're not listening.  Of course.  And then we've quickly gone, no, we're listening to your story.  Little insight on the show.  Wow, those guys are good listeners.  Yeah.  No, we're not.  They really pay attention.  Oh my God, 63 and three-quarters sell.  That's funny.  Well, and it's coming down, Puff Daddy has been indicted on weapons charges. 
[98:30]
 Oh no, say it's not so.  Weapons charges?  Now he's got Johnny Cochran.  Yeah.  His own dream team.  They always talk about the dream team.  It's only Cochran.  And then this other guy, Benjamin Brafman.  Yeah.  He's got, because they've got to have the white guy.  Any black guy that gets in trouble, they get Johnny Cochran, but then you need the obligatory  white guy.  Usually it's that little wormy DNA guy.  Dershowitz?  No, not Dershowitz.  Barry Sheck. 
[99:00]
 Barry Sheck.  Barry Sheck.  Barry Sheck.  Boy, his hair don't look too greasy.  It looks like he's got DNA in his hair.  Did that guy shower once during the OJ trial?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but he's got the Oreo team, the black and white, and Johnny Cochran right there.  That's got to cost a buck.  He's got the money though.  Not for long though.  He's heading down the MC Hammer road.  Quickly. 
[99:30]
 You think so?  Quickly.  Yeah, that's true.  He better watch that E, True Hollywood Story on MC Hammer.  He should get a copy of that.  And watch it every day.  Every day.  Because he's heading that way.  I mean, his latest album isn't doing as well as they thought.  Can't touch this.  Now he's in trouble.  He's going to have to pay a fortune to Johnny Cochran and his rhyming.  He bought a $10 million house.  And then he had his posse just drain him like so many leeches. 
[100:00]
 MC Hammer.  MC Hammer.  And now Puffy, you're right, he's running down the same road.  The last album he put out didn't sell as good, did it?  He's got to look out.  He should be watching his cash.  It's out now.  Alright, so we're looking forward to the Johnny Cochran rhymes.  Although I didn't say that, Opie did, Puffy.  He's been known to break into places and just have people beat the crap out of people that  bad mouth them.  Alright, we've got to play a little ditty from Airsick Productions. 
[100:30]
 Airsick.net if you want to check out any of their stuff.  They've got a little Puffy and Jennifer song here on the Opie and Anthony Show, WAW.  I'm the movie queen in the hip hop scene.  Me and Puffy together. 
[101:00]
 Didn't think you were dumb till you had a gun.  They threw both of us in the slammer.  And now I hear that you're dissing me.  A pistol, I'm pissed off.  What is my defense?  You think I'd turn on you?  Cut myself a deal.  And turn states ever dead.  Busted for that night.  Oh.  When even though I was in harm. 
[101:30]
 Busted for that night.  Oh.  Now Puffy thinks I'll do him harm.  Busted for that night.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No anal is okay.  Train wreck radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[102:00]
 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York.  That's what we used to say right there.  Oh yeah.  I'll be honest that was a slip.  The Rock of New York.  This place has been so many things I'm surprised we don't slip more often.  Love songs.  Nothing but love songs.  Classic rock with classic jocks. 
[102:30]
 Okay.  Oh Zootomia.  What do we know?  We got it.  We got to do our monthly tribute to Scott.  Oh Zootomia.  Okay.  Oh shoot.  You talked over the best part. 
[103:00]
 I'm going to have to play it again.  Oh yeah.  Oh Zootomia.  Oh.  I love that guy.  Nothing funnier than an old man just like.  All right. 
[103:30]
 Scott.  Make no mistake about it.  We love that guy.  Cool to us.  And Scott so proved himself to be a survival survivor.  He's still on the airwaves in New York.  God you guys think we're lazy on our radio show.  I would like to have his gig.  Wow.  He does one hour.  One hour a day.  Tune into the Scott so show tomorrow for our Beatles block and some ELO. 
[104:00]
 That's all we got time for.  And then Friday for British biscuits.  And oops that's all we got time for.  Not even a big biscuit a little one.  I mean we're supposed to do five hours.  We usually do what?  Four hours and twenty minutes.  So that's not too bad.  He does an hour.  And it's pre-recorded.  Oh well. 
[104:30]
 You know you see a war happening.  All of a sudden one launched against our country New York in flames.  You'd hear Scott say.  And now it's some Fleetwood man.  Because it was recorded.  You wouldn't know.  The next day it would be like holy Jiminy Cricket.  Nuclear weapon.  I want that gig.  You think we'll ever last long enough to have the one hour gig.  Hell no.  You got to work what like 50 years to get the one hour gig. 
[105:00]
 He is at least still on New York radio.  We will probably be relegated to a CB Channel 4.  I think.  I don't care.  Just be booted out of everything.  Breaker breaker it's the ONA show.  We're bitter and miserable and hate each other.  We have alienated half the business so far.  50% of the stations out there will not hire us.  I know isn't that.  And God forbid we get fired from here.  Then it's pretty much down to maybe like 5% of the business will still hire us. 
[105:30]
 We'll be doing farm reports in Nebraska.  That's how consolidated this business is getting though.  In the old days you get fired.  You piss off one station, one company.  Nowadays you get fired you piss off half the business.  And it was like it was strange because in the old days if you got fired.  It wasn't out of the ordinary to bring a lawsuit against your old company.  It's like silly to do that now.  Oh my God.  Especially since you know it's like mega corp. 
[106:00]
 We own everything.  It's like where are you going to go?  CB Channel 14.  Or internet radio.  The Radio Shack.  Radio Shack.  I'm in Radio Shack.  Work down at the store.  Peter.  I don't know how Puff Daddy got caught with that gun.  Huh?  I don't know how he got caught with that gun.  Why didn't he just shove it up Jennifer Lopez's butt?  They never would have found it.  Really right? 
[106:30]
 Well that's why more people didn't get hurt at the club though.  They all hid behind that big ass.  Where'd everybody go?  I was trying to shoot someone.  Come on Jennifer's ass.  Thank you.  God damn.  Hey John what's up?  Hey how you doing O&A?  What's up guys?  Well first of all how come you guys don't support corrections that often?  I always hear you talking about cops.  I'll tell you what.  We don't know much about you guys. 
[107:00]
 If I could field this one I will take this.  You know why we don't support you?  Why?  We get so many calls from the prisoners.  And from the sound of the background it doesn't sound like you guys are doing squat.  These guys are calling us up.  They're all yelling.  Kill O&A.  Kill O&A.  In a prison let's get this straight.  The city covers jails.  The state covers prisons.  I'm a state CO. 
[107:30]
 I'm in a prison.  How can you say you get calls from prisoners?  That's impossible.  In a state prison the only way you can get calls from a prisoner is if you're on their calling list.  What do you guys on prison is calling list?  Yes. We must be.  No you can't be. It's got to be approved.  We've gotten some calls from state prisons.  Not state prisons. No way.  What is Rikers?  Rikers is a city jail. 
[108:00]
 What's that other one we get calls from?  I don't know.  I forgot. Essex something.  Oh that's in Jersey?  I don't know about Jersey but anyway.  Well that's good enough for us.  They scare the Jesus out of us.  We like you guys.  Oh yeah okay. Now you say that now because I'm on the phone.  I might be in the joint.  Hey baby where's Gova?  If there was nobody to keep them in there what would you do?  You know what I mean?  Figure it out.  Opie and Anthony love everyone. 
[108:30]
 It's the only way we're going to become number one.  We love everyone.  But listen. Rudy's got to get in man.  Because if he doesn't get in and runs for governor.  See how he's shifting the cops?  He's going to shift us even more.  Alright.  Everyone's out for themselves.  What?  Everyone's out for themselves in this election.  Not everyone.  Not everyone but it would be better if he went to be a senator.  Because if he becomes governor forget about him. 
[109:00]
 He won't be governor.  He'll be senator and I think he'll be a good senator.  You just got to hope that the mayor that gets in or anybody involved with the city.  Has to hope that the next mayor that gets in here is a good one.  Well not for nothing Ant.  You could run against Hillary and get elected.  Alright John we got someone on line 11 that has a problem with you.  Who is that?  Chris.  Chris.  Hey you're on with John. What's up?  Listen do me a favor. 
[109:30]
 Give this guy the train wreck because he's terrible.  Correction officers are nothing but perps with guns.  Who are you?  I'm a cop.  Where are you a cop?  I'm a cop in the city.  Alright and what's the problem?  I'm driving around right now working while you're probably sitting down eating a pizza or something doing absolutely nothing.  Hey not for nothing. Do you even know any state CO's?  Sure.  You don't? Where do they work?  The ones we lock up.  Where do they work?  State one. Out in the island. 
[110:00]
 Out in the island? That's not a state CO.  There is no state prison in Long Island.  Oh whatever.  Come on if you're going to debate something, know what you're talking about.  You guys are security guards that's all you are.  Security guards? Okay.  Alright Chris thank you.  I don't think Chris is for real there John.  Hold on a second.  I don't know I think he is.  Well I got a better one on line three. John you still there?  Yeah I'm still here.  Alright we got a guy in jail that wants to talk to you.  A guy in jail? 
[110:30]
 These are always the best. Vinny!  Hey! You're in jail?  What are you in jail for?  Arson.  What are you a fire bug?  Or are you going for insurance money?  Where are you in jail?  Monmouth County.  Monmouth County?  Monmouth County?  Where the hell is that?  Monmouth County.  Where are you still at?  What prison are you in?  I'm in Monmouth County getting ready to get your transfer down to... 
[111:00]
 You're in Jersey?  They got pay phones in county jails.  Yeah.  That's because a county jail is either  a holding facility, it's not  he's not sentenced.  You want to sit?  So what are you awaiting transfer?  Okay see?  Where are you?  I'm a CO in New York State.  Where you?  CO in New York State.  That's right.  Vinny! 
[111:30]
 What?  A liquor store.  I don't know.  Shut your mouth!  They wouldn't sell you liquor?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, man!  What happened?  I don't know.  I got a good deal.  I got a four flat, a $500,000 fine.  Look at this.  $500,000 fine and you burnt the place down?  What did you do?  Just throw a bottle of gas in there? 
[112:00]
 And the two other people who did it with me  turned to evidence and razzed me out.  That's the stuff, right?  Shut up!  The COs here are garbage, man.  They're with the rest of them all over, man.  They're fairies, man!  They're not only taking sexual favors.  So you're saying they take sexual favors  from the inmates?  They're punks, just like some of the fairies, man.  Wow.  You guys are awesome.  Alright, Vinnie, thank you.  And look who you're talking to. 
[112:30]
 Look who you're talking to.  A convicted felon.  The guy's a monk!  Well, this guy, Jeff, is a former convict.  Jeff?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  You got words for John on the line?  Oh, yeah.  He's a security guy with a cardigan.  He belongs in London, being one of those cops.  I've been down before for like 12 months.  And they do the crossword puzzles.  Where were you with Con?  Warton's track down in Camden.  One of the worst stuff. 
[113:00]
 Everything's in New Jersey.  Hey, O&A, don't you have any...  O&A, why are you just putting him back in the bubble?  He's a bubble man.  He needs some oxygen in those bubbles.  What is it?  It's better now.  Why don't you bring up the food?  Bring up the food.  See? No New York State person is, right?  I'm trying, John.  I got arrested one weekend and I got brought to the tombs.  Talk about...  New York correction officers are about the same as, I can't say it, but... 
[113:30]
 a turd.  They do nothing.  I'll go before you give me the train wreck.  Look at that, and you're a criminal.  I made a mistake.  I made a mistake when I was 18.  And then the corrections finally get me when I'm 23.  How many prides you got?  One.  That was the first time I was in trouble.  I played AAA for the Mets.  One time I did something wrong.  You get one chance. 
[114:00]
 No, I don't.  I got arrested and put in jail.  I don't get a chance.  What did you do?  I did a little stuff on the side.  I sold a little stuff.  What did you do?  What did you get convicted of?  Cocaine.  I should have been put in a drug program and that's that.  I didn't get that.  I couldn't even get PTI.  The judge, matter of fact, was my father's priest.  It probably wasn't your first offense. 
[114:30]
 I swear to God, it was.  I was.  Let me go before you give me the train wreck.  What did you have, like 20 kilos or something?  I had an ounce.  An ounce of what?  For my personal use, I wasn't going to sell it.  I was going to sell it.  I had $2,000.  You had a bad lawyer.  No, really.  You should have gotten off on that one.  I had the senator give me a letter of recommendation.  I found it for PTA, my dad's a fireman or cop.  How many years do you get? 
[115:00]
 I got a three flat and I got a hit while I was inside because, like I said, a cracker decided to be a man and tried to confront me and I had to knock him down.  So they gave me a hit.  This is a pretty high standing citizen.  Look at that.  Well, first of all, the guard was a gay.  First of all, he's gay.  I'm taking a shot.  He looked at my penis.  Now he's against homosexuals.  Oh, yeah. 
[115:30]
 I hate fags.  He's being honest.  I'm not prejudiced.  I just hate everybody.  Thank you, John Rocker.  John, hold on a sec.  Everyone wants to talk to John.  John, I'm going to put you on one more guy here, alright?  Who's this?  A guy named Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, John.  You guys are a bunch of Barney Fipes with a single bullet.  And who are you?  You don't need to know who I am. 
[116:00]
 Nobody wants to identify themselves.  Well, wouldn't you fail a post office test?  Identify yourself.  Where do you pick up your block of cheese?  Who are you?  You don't need to know who I am.  Why not?  Why, you want to write me a love letter, you fag?  You don't want to identify yourself.  You know, back yourself up, man.  Oh, back myself up into what?  Into you?  See, you're probably just another mope.  Yeah, a mope. 
[116:30]
 Spell it.  You don't know how?  Oh, I stumped you, huh?  What, do you hang out with old Dirty?  Yeah, no, that is a real mope.  Okay.  Hey, don't you be dissing our pals.  Well, I like old Dirty.  Not for not knowing, eh?  He's the best skill we know.  He's the best skill you know.  Hey, speaking of old Dirty, he's on the warm line.  Joe, I'm going to let you go, right?  Right, man.  He's on the wire? 
[117:00]
 Hold on a sec.  Joe, if you're still listening, great freaking job.  John.  Old Dirty.  What the heck is a mope?  Mope these nuts, you punk-ass.  You get $3 an hour.  Pussy.  You're a pussy, shut up.  You're a pussy.  You're a pussy.  You couldn't get a new job,  and now you make $3 an hour.  You think you're something? You ain't nothing.  You're a pussy. 
[117:30]
 Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up, Joe Cop.  Shut up.  I'm talking.  Shut up.  Oh, my man.  I ain't going to jail because I ain't no...  I don't blame myself to be a great star.  I am not a criminal.  You are, on the other hand.  It's my education.  The best thing to do was get a job as a CEO.  Big deal, bro. 
[118:00]
 You're a pussy.  You're a pussy, bro.  I'm a monkey, that's right.  So what?  I'm a mope, so what?  Shut up.  Shut up.  I ain't never going to Attica.  I'm not going to Attica.  You're locked up every day.  That's why you got the attitude you got.  You are locked up every day.  You're a pussy, man.  Daddy's talking.  Daddy's talking. 
[118:30]
 You're a mope.  You don't even know me.  I don't need to know you.  I saw you on the radio, man.  You don't even know me, man.  All I got to see is your attitude on the radio.  What do you think you are?  Because you are CEO.  What are you, a gunner?  You need to step with that, punk.  You need to step.  That's my word.  Look at this guy, man.  Yo, yo, yo, all day, man, pardon me, man. 
[119:00]
 I'm not even going to get to this guy's level, man.  I'm not even going to get to this guy's level.  I'm not going to go there.  I'm not going to go there.  All right, old dirty.  Hey, old dirty.  If you put that kind of energy into getting a job,  you'd be the president of the IBM.  There you go, man.  All right, man.  Old dirty wants to be a gangster.  What happened?  Old dirty wants to be a gangster.  I ain't no gangster.  I don't walk in as a gangster. 
[119:30]
 I don't blame myself as a gangster.  I never led that life, my man.  I never led that life, my man.  You're talking to an intelligent fraud, man, CEO.  All right.  You keep talking.  Shut up.  All right, man.  Old dirty, I got to move on.  There's a bunch of other guys who want a piece of job.  Maybe you should get a job, man.  I got a life.  I got a life, CEO.  All right, go be unlocked tomorrow, pussy.  Oh, young up. 
[120:00]
 Wow.  Old dirty, where does that come from?  He never gets that piss off.  Hold on, let's put you on with a couple more here.  I want a piece of you.  Do I get paid for this or what?  Hell no.  Like we said, you guys do the show for us.  We sit back and get all the credit.  There you go. You're on E-Trade.  Who's the other guy?  After I was actually...  Deli, you're a former convict.  No doubt.  Keep this. 
[120:30]
 Everybody who's talking about New York City jails,  they all are frontin'.  Old dirty and everybody else is frontin' because  let me tell you, up in the island, I know mad COs.  I was locked up.  And they be putting it on people who get out of line.  Where were you locked up?  I was on the island.  I was at C-74 and I was in HVM.  You were a state prisoner?  Oh yes, I did time in Southampton State Penitentiary.  Where the hell is that?  Southampton, North Carolina.  I thought they had a prison out in the Hamptons  in Long Island. 
[121:00]
 My word, I'm not getting my candy on.  Before lockdown,  what is this?  Where's my Domber in Yule?  In the State Penitentiary, people have it good.  You get locked up and you go into the State Penitentiary  and they look at you  and you on that Rarot stuff and they go,  you must be from like a diamond.  And they just put it on you.  They don't go for that stuff.  People are just selling down during their time.  But all that crap people talking, you get locked up.  You get locked up in New York City 
[121:30]
 and you come out your mouth, even the littlest bit  that you think you're hard or killer,  and those COs will put you in a cell  and put it on you.  They will whip your ass like they would do tomorrow.  Hey, don't give sent up to Clinton.  I'm telling you right now.  I'm saying it's sad for real.  Do you have a congressman on the phone?  No, no, no.  I'm from Chatham or New York.  What's his name?  John, John, I hear you talking.  Everybody else is selling dreams on the radio.  You get off the island and see what happens. 
[122:00]
 I got to cut you off because we got  Congressman Ackerman on the line.  Let's add a little respectability.  I want to talk to him.  Hold on a sec. Let's add some respectability to this show.  Let me...  Congressman Ackerman.  Listen, I was listening to your  congressional oratory. Is that what the COs are all about?  First of all, I want to thank you...  It sounded like a congressional debate to me.  I figured I had to get into this.  I want to thank you for the Christmas card, sir.  Oh, hey, you're quite welcome.  He signed it himself and everything. 
[122:30]
 In person, in person.  I was amazed.  I was trying to get to Hooters, you know.  Except one of those COs stopped me.  He ran a light.  He dragged my ass down and he said,  how'd you like to go to Clinton?  I'm supporting him.  Not only is he a congressman, he's a comedian on the side, Anthony.  I see that.  We're going to put you on with John the State Cop, right?  Put me on with John.  Alright, John?  You're on with Congressman Ackerman. 
[123:00]
 Is this really Congressman Ackerman?  Hey, John, really, Congressman Ackerman.  Would you rather stop me saying I was doing 68 in the 65 zone?  No.  You guys do a great job, by the way.  I just want to tell you that.  There's a lot of stuff we need, man.  I know you need, but you know what they say, John?  What do they say?  You suck.  This really isn't him.  It really is.  He calls our show all the time.  The only thing you can help us with though is federal legislation.  That really isn't going to do much for the state prisons. 
[123:30]
 No.  One of the things we do is we try to set the pay grade right for the federal prisons.  That's not going to help us in the state.  Well, no, it raises the bar.  We need either a state senator or an assemblyman.  You got one in every state?  I used to be a state senator.  Where's your friend?  This is a first.  Training a congressman.  Who's that? 
[124:00]
 Senator Nazzolio.  Oh, yeah.  I can quickly tell.  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, God, that had to hurt.  You can't train a congressman?  I call him as I see him.  Oh, my God.  The only politician that likes our show, you idiot. 
[124:30]
 He'll understand.  All of a sudden we were on Meet the Friggin' Press.  Jesus Christ.  A double training, that was.  That was classic.  Right at the end, the guy caught on.  He's like, oh, no.  Not enough time to get off the track.  Like when Wile E. Coyote just pulled the shades down in the dynamite shack.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right. 
[125:00]
 Let's take a break.  All right.  We'll be back.  Kids with kids.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  We're out of control.  We're so lucky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  God, I just figured it out, Anthony.  I swear to God, I thought I was going crazy.  I went to the show yesterday.  I'm on the subway.  And I'm singing, only the beginning. 
[125:30]
 And I'm thinking to myself, why is this stupid song stuck in my head?  I don't like Chicago.  Maybe you're listening to Classic Q.  And then on the way into work on the subway again, it popped in.  Only the beginning.  And I'm just plumbing it to myself, like, why am I such a fag?  It's that damn commercial.  We don't even listen to the commercials on the show because we're too busy doing stuff.  I guess subliminally, they're popping into our eardrum.  Could someone mark where Obe just yelled that?  Why am I such a fag? 
[126:00]
 On the dad and we could just put that in something.  Why am I such a fag?  I'm sitting there, I'm reading about Puffy and John Rocker this morning.  And I'm just going, why am I freaking home on this damn thing?  Nissan, bravo, good job.  Hey, look at that, you even knew the company.  You remember the product even, so I guess they're doing something right.  Thanks, John.  Hey, congratulations to the Simpsons.  Ten years in running.  Ten years.  Absolutely amazing on that.  Started out on that lousy Tracy Ullman show. 
[126:30]
 Yep, with the bad drawings and stuff.  Yeah, you see the way they looked originally?  Don't look like that anymore.  We're in the middle of a commercial break here.  Oh, we are.  I thought that was a short break.  Stacker 2.  Yes.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Anthony, what can you tell us about Stacker 2?  Well, if you pack the pounds on for the holidays, it's winter, you're wearing heavier clothes and stuff.  You tend to add a few pounds to your frame.  Well, what happens when the warm weather starts?  You've got to take that off.  You'll be fat, unattractive in our looks-oriented society. 
[127:00]
 John's calling back.  He just got trained.  Hold on a second.  John.  What?  What did you say when you realized the train was just about to smash you?  I'm in my car going home.  Yeah.  I'm in a lot of traffic.  I didn't even realize it was a train.  I heard all the horns that caught us had gone.  And I'm right next to the railroad too on Sunrise Highway.  So.  I think he thought he was going to get stuck by a crossing because he was like, oh no.  Yeah, you said, oh no or something.  Was that really Gary Ackerman?  Yes.  Yeah.  He calls us all the time.  He loves the show.  He sends us notes from time to time.  He'll understand why we trained.  I hope so.  He likes the show. 
[127:30]
 We love Tiger Smith Ackerman.  He sent us a Christmas card.  Oh, he's a good guy.  Yeah.  No doubt.  All right, John, we're going to let you go.  All right, man.  We'll see you in a minute.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  In the middle of our stacker two.  Yeah.  Well, I'm ready here Anthony.  You packed on some pounds.  When you start taking those clothes off, you're going to be fat. 
[128:00]
 Start now.  Stacker two.  Yeah.  If you want to get ready for spring, you don't wait until March or April.  You do it now.  It's too late.  Do it now.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late. 
[128:30]
 It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  One 0 2 7 WNAW!  It's Obe and Anthony.  Hey man.  Old Dirty's pissed off, he wants to talk off air, but  We don't do anything off the air.  No.  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty, man. 
[129:00]
 Oh my...  Yeah, I gotta apologize to the people that listened to this show.  I am sorry, I mean, let me tell you something.  You know.  Wow, you are pissed.  No, I'm here, man.  Let me tell you something.  Corrections officers who carry that type of attitude should be ashamed of themselves because  people who commit crimes and enter into the penal system, into the corrections system,  and go to jail, in prison, whatever, you know, whatever differences exist, it's still the 
[129:30]
 same thing, you're locked up.  They go into being rehabilitated, okay?  Now, if there's people that get out of line, well, they're supposed to use force to keep  them in line.  You know what I'm saying?  But he got this tin badge, he got this attitude, like, you know, it's a whole big fraternity,  it's a big gang, you know?  Come on, man.  It's not all about that.  And that's what gives people the wrong impression, all right, about civil service in uniform,  you know, speaking about the police and then the CEOs. 
[130:00]
 He should be ashamed of himself.  He should be a place to be rehabilitated.  For those who need to be rehabilitated, then you can be.  But not y'all.  We're going to whack this guy, we're going to hit.  He should be ashamed of himself, that punk.  Hey, Wells had done 65 in after-hours training.  I saw that.  Oh, man, you got to play P-Cop, bro.  You mother...  Hey, there's a chick that hates you.  This is always funny.  I don't care. 
[130:30]
 Hold on.  You're on a roll today.  I'm on a freaking roll.  I'm not saying we get more email about Old Dirty than any other one of our characters  for the show.  What, is it hate mail?  No, people either hate you or love you.  That's what I love about you, man.  You just get people bent, either way.  You know?  Dee?  Yes?  You hate Old Dirty?  Old Dirty?  I've been trying to get through to talk to you for a while because I don't understand  something.  All you do is put down people.  I'm not putting anybody down.  Let me speak.  I'll give you a chance to speak. 
[131:00]
 You give me a chance to speak.  All you do is put down this person.  You do this for a living.  You make three dollars.  You do this for a living.  You only make this much.  From what I can tell you...  Why do you think I've ever said anything like that?  You have no time.  What are you talking about?  Do you listen to the show, madam?  I listen to the show, sir.  Okay, madam.  The other day you said, I am such an intelligent man.  Meanwhile, then the next thing you said, you said, you're not.  These are my men.  These are my men.  Honey, honey, it's called jumping in and out of character.  You know what I'm saying? 
[131:30]
 Character?  You are.  You are a character.  I think that was a compliment, sweetie.  I think that was a compliment.  See, old Dirty uses characters.  Like Mr. Ameth.  All right, D.  Okay, thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Hi.  Old Dirty, you want to go round two or what?  It's waiting for you.  I'm under one whippa doppin' right now, man.  Round two with John?  What do you say?  John, John, he's back on the phone?  Yeah.  Oh, no, he's an upstanding citizen.  Oh, he's an upstanding citizen.  Listen, listen.  What do you say? 
[132:00]
 John, John, he's back on the phone?  Yeah.  Let's roll the tape, babe.  I never said this one gets whacked and that one gets whacked.  I wasn't talking about if you go up to Clinton that the COs are going to beat you.  You said that to the guys.  And the prisoners are going to beat your ass.  Yeah, all right.  That's right.  All right.  That's right.  I'm not a criminal.  I'm not.  Yeah, all right, whatever.  I'm not even going to get to your level, bro.  I go out there and I do my job.  I'm not even going to get to your level, kid.  Yeah, okay.  Whatever you want to say.  Yeah, but don't let the old age say that you're a good person.  I'm not saying anything to you.  I'm not saying anything to you. 
[132:30]
 I'm not saying anything.  I'm not putting words in your mouth.  I didn't say anything that you didn't say or lead on to saying.  All right?  You did.  No, I didn't.  You heard it.  No, I didn't.  You said, oh, we're going to whack this one and whack that one.  That's not what this job is all about.  Well, then explain yourself.  All right?  You didn't come off sounding like any different than what you were making yourself out to be.  Hey, no, it ain't.  Roll the tape, man.  Roll the tape.  I never said that.  I never said we were prisoners.  Come on, man.  It's no attitude, bro.  It's no attitude.  I never said that.  I never said that.  I never said that.  Yeah, all right.  You got to have an attitude.  Listen, you think you're so bad.  No, I don't think I'm anything.  I don't think, yo, my man, I don't think I'm nothing. 
[133:00]
 I don't think I'm going to be a father.  God, I love calling in an airstrike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  I love calling in a strike.  God, I love calling in an airstrike.  Oh, yeah. 
[133:30]
 Look at him burn.  Come on.  Oh, dirty.  You'll understand.  What happened?  I love that one.  That's a great one.  All in the airstrike.  Oh, too funny.  Hey, we got to play that Psycho Mark thing again, the montage.  Oh, right. 
[134:00]
 I'm going to laugh my ass off over here.  I think we've had enough with the COs, the COPs, the ODs, the Congressman, the OBGYNs.  We want to get back to gas.  Oh, boy.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  We're running late.  We're going there?  All right.  The Psycho Mark song, Anthony.  Or montage, I should say, from yesterday. 
[134:30]
 We got channel two news on.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  The hugest wousa.  This is like interactive TV.  Hey, guys, it's the huge wousa.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  What happened? 
[135:00]
 What happened.  What did you expect?  You looks like a soccer liksom.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  You look like a stock-raising lunatic.  You can't be doing this.  What the hell you boys did?  You're interrupting our own news broadcast.  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know. 
[135:30]
 Take on my heart.  Chance, whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Marsha Claire, she's very mad at me.  You tell her go to a hard box.  No, I'm not. I'm just hanging out.  If you should be in line for your job, I should be in line for yours.  I almost pissed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very, very long time. 
[136:00]
 Mark, I got one question for you.  How do you walk around with that set, you guys?  What do you like, walk around like John Wayne, Sway and Mike?  Yeah, I just want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you got to listen every day.  This could be it right here today.  You never know.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[136:30]
 212-757-1027.  Take a couple calls here real fast.  John, what's up?  Hey, John.  Hello.  What's up? You're on the air, man.  Yo, I just want to tell you guys that that napalm bit was beautiful, yo.  I never heard you guys do that one before.  The air strike is...  Oh, the air strike. Oh, I love the air strike.  A lot of people getting used to the train, so we figure we're going to have to come up with a few more things that will cut the conversation a little short.  Oh, it was great. 
[137:00]
 The next one we got to get at is a crane falling.  Crane falling on someone's head.  That could be funny with the squeaking metal and stuff.  Alright, John.  Alright, thanks.  Oh, and I want to tell that pig, that pig John, to get a real job, that pussy.  Alright, thank you.  Alright, bye.  Stalker Patty on the line, Anthony.  Hello, Patty.  Hi, how are you guys?  Very good. How are you today?  I'm fine, how are you?  Very well. What are you doing here, Patty? 
[137:30]
 Well, I'm at home sitting. I just wanted to call in and congratulate Psycho Mark. He really outdid himself yesterday.  Oh, another love interest, Patty?  No.  I thought maybe you went into Psycho Mark now.  I know you were going to keep on me.  You have something in common. The psycho thing.  I'm not psycho. I wouldn't have the nerve to do what he did, but that was funny.  I was on the bus going home and I was laughing and people were looking at me, but I couldn't help it. 
[138:00]
 I just burst out laughing.  I bet they see that a lot.  Oh, no, they don't.  Hey, Patty?  Yes.  When was the last time you pleasured yourself?  You're real funny, Opie. You're such comedians.  Really funny.  So, when was it?  Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me. 
[138:30]
 Anyway, I like the newest effect with the air strike.  It's better than the train.  Don't worry. You'll never get that, Patty.  I hope not.  You can stay on as long as you like.  Okay.  Anyway, that's all I called to say. You should get an award or something for that brilliant performance. He was terrific.  All right, stalker Patty.  Okay.  You're going to hang up in a good mood, right?  Yeah, I'm always in a good mood.  Okay, that's good.  We like keeping you happy. 
[139:00]
 That's what I am happy about.  I just want to keep you as happy as possible until all the home security equipment is in place.  Excuse me?  Oh, nothing.  You guys are funny.  The Sloman Shield protecting against Patty.  That's Patty.  All right, very funny, Anthony. You're a comedian.  Was I funny too, Patty?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, Patty. 
[139:30]
 All right, bye.  Bye, bye.  Bye.  Have a good day. Bye-bye.  You too. Bye-bye.  All right.  There she goes, Patty.  Brian!  What's up, man?  What's up?  I got a good new sound effect for you.  Okay.  Stampede.  That might be good, like starting off in the distance.  Big stampede.  Write that one down, Ben. That could be good.  It just kind of runs over whoever is in the way.  That's very good.  All right, Brian.  All right, later.  Thank you.  And who left the cows out of the pan? 
[140:00]
 Nigga Charlie.  Have we played that yet today?  I don't know my computer.  That's right.  Well, Ben Stein got robbed.  What?  Game show host Ben Stein was held up recently in front of his Beverly Hills home, Anthony.  Oh.  Two men approached him outside his home.  One was carrying a gun.  They demanded money and jewelry.  Steal Ben Stein's money.  If you could guess what's in my pants, that's right, a big load of crap. 
[140:30]
 I'm scared.  And Ben Stein gladly gave the robbers the money, Anthony.  Here you go.  Scurry away now.  Wow.  Robbed.  Yeah.  Did they catch the guys?  Nope.  In Beverly Hills?  Beverly Hills, yes.  Wow, they're robbing people in front of their houses in Beverly Hills.  That's scary.  Wow.  Stein even offered his vehicle.  What is he, a dope?  Take my car. 
[141:00]
 I don't need it.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Fueller?  Fueller?  Anyone?  Anyone?  They stuck this type of weapon in my ribs.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  A gun in my ribs and asked for my, my, anyone, anyone, money, money and jewelry, yes.  I offered them this thing.  Anyone? 
[141:30]
 Form of transportation.  Anyone?  My car.  They declined to take it and escaped on.  Anyone?  How did they escape?  Anyone?  Fueller?  Fueller?  Anyone?  On foot?  Escaped on foot.  There you have it.  It was great in that movie.  Steal Ben Stein's money.  I think we've done enough show today.  Let's get out of here.  Why?  Why not?  I do have to get out of here promptly at the end of the show. 
[142:00]
 Yeah, you have to go see Adam Farrar tonight.  Adam Farrar tonight and Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Governor's in Leather Town.  I'm going tonight to see my pal.  Hallelujah.  We've got to play the other rock song.  Yeah, we've got a few from Airsick Productions.  These guys, Billy and Paul, they can pump them out, can't they?  Yeah, they pump out songs about some of the things we do on the show on a weekly basis.  And if you want to check out any of their stuff, it's airsick.net, Anthony.  And they've got a song on here called The Hypocrite Rock. 
[142:30]
 The Hypocrite Rock.  Right.  I like the one we played earlier.  Yeah, that's a pretty good one.  The Rock's a Pussy.  That was pretty fun.  I haven't heard this one yet, so let's check it out together, okay?  All right.  It's the gang from Airsick Productions.  Everyone was talking about The Rock leaving our show last week.  The Rock says.  And they wrote a little ditty about him.  Here it is.  In the beginning, the rock was fun.  But before the show was done, Sick Boy had changed the rock's tone.  And he really pissed off this half-breasted moan.  And when he left was a real big shot.  With tears running down the face of his face, he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot. 
[143:00]
 And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  Sick Boy had changed the rock's tone.  And he really pissed off this half-breasted moan.  And when he left was a real big shot.  With tears running down the face of the rock.  Everybody thinks this whole thing's a crock.  But you must remember he's dumber than mankind's stock.  Well, the rockman we've been cause of a dresslin' and something got the rock peep.  Someone had to tell him about it cause I doubt the rock can read.  Oh, he thought the rock was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot. 
[143:30]
 And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot. 
[144:00]
 And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  And he was a real big shot.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  Quick musical break.  Some days we play more music than others, right, Anthony?  Yeah, we've been having a lot of fun today.  I think so, too.  Yeah.  Toadies, Possum Kingdom, from the Rubberneck CD.  Nine Inch Nails before that.  Head like a hole.  Um, oh, hold on. 
[144:30]
 Mikey?  Hey, guys.  Hey, hey.  This is Mike from Woodhaven.  How are you?  You're a little pissed off at Andrew the Angry.  I had a pretty smart ass comment from a losing team, but we'll give them this.  The same guy that's probably cleaning those pissing sheets is picking up the drool from  Ralph Klein's lip.  They got guys in there that have to wear bibs when they work around them.  Oh, wow.  Got him.  How you boys doing, all right?  Yeah, we're hanging out.  You want to go over this tonight?  Uh, it's going to be there. 
[145:00]
 Yeah, I'm going to go.  Hey, I went to Billy Dean's recently.  The place is sick.  Billy Dean's?  Yeah, didn't that used to be a male dance, make a dance club?  No, no.  Billy Dean's.  That's what's there on Monday nights.  Why?  What is it on Monday?  I don't know.  On the weekends, it's shaving cream wrestling.  It's sick.  Six foot women with shaving cream.  Oh, yeah.  All right, rock.  That never gets old, huh, Mike?  No.  What's the year you go?  You know, you throw your money in and you go home poor.  Yeah.  All right.  Good smile. 
[145:30]
 Cool.  Be cool, guys.  Thank you.  Trying to cover all bases today, Ant.  Yeah.  We've done a pretty good job.  John Rocker all over the news.  Yeah.  Now he's apologizing.  Yadda doodle.  They cleaned him up.  I like this boy.  He says something stupid and apologizes like the Grease Man joke.  Remember the Grease Man when I said they ought to drag him behind trucks?  No wonder they drag him behind...  What the hell did the Grease Man say?  I don't know.  No wonder they dragged him behind trucks.  I don't even want to repeat what he said.  Slick and lead, yadda doodle, bone dry, bone dry, yeah. 
[146:00]
 Well, he's on his apology tour now.  They cleaned him up.  They parted his hair.  That's what the Grease Man did.  He went up to the apology tour.  I went to all the black people and said, I'm sorry.  The Grease Man's very sorry, yeah.  Wadda doodle offered him a bone dry martini, snarling, yeah.  Wadda doodle.  I hear the Mets added a diesel battery day for this upcoming season.  Oh, yeah.  You think when this guy's ever going to be able to...  And not even New York.  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's going to be a good thing.  I think it's going to be a good thing.  I think it's going to be a good thing.  I think it's going to be a good thing.  I hear the Mets added a diesel battery day for this upcoming season.  Oh, yeah.  You think when this guy's ever going to be able to... 
[146:30]
 And not even New York.  Just like any stadium, step in there without getting razed.  He's going to have a nightmare year.  Yeah.  It'll be fun to watch.  It will be fun.  A diesel battery day.  I think it's going to be 12-volt interstate car battery day.  I just see big 12-volt truck batteries flying out.  Get that blue launcher that you see at Jones Beach.  The...  Frank.  Yo.  What's up?  Listen, dude.  I was listening to some of the radio stations this morning, and Shane McMahon was on. 
[147:00]
 He was?  Yeah.  They had him on for a little bit.  What station had Shane on?  You can't curse.  Huh?  You can't curse.  Don't say the S word.  I'm sorry, dude.  What station had Shane on?  Get to you.  Oh.  Get to you.  I don't know.  The guy in the truck listened to it.  I don't listen to it.  But I heard him on, so I wanted to call and ask him what happened with the rock the other  day with you guys.  Yeah.  And they dumped right out of it.  They didn't want to talk about it.  What? 
[147:30]
 You were on the air?  Yeah, man.  They dumped...  I was on for a few minutes, and then they dumped right out of it, and they said they  lost me.  No, it's weird.  I'm going to lose you guys, because I'm on the calling cards.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  You know what's weird?  WWF hasn't even called us.  Yeah.  Hasn't even given us the courtesy of a phone call to discuss what happened last week.  I'm feeling a bit jilted by them, Hopey.  I mean, they're obviously pissed, and they have every right to be.  I'm not going to lie, but we're also pissed.  Why? 
[148:00]
 Huh?  Why?  Because they feel like, you know, that...  I don't know why to be honest.  They have no right to be pissed at us.  But they are pissed.  They're pissed.  We're pissed.  We could call up and talk about it, like human beings, like civil humans.  We could talk with them.  We had a good relationship with them.  I don't think one little episode with the Rock is going to ruin our relationship with  them.  I don't know.  They... you know, Rick, before he went on vacation, he put at least four calls into  the head office. 
[148:30]
 No one will call us back.  Oh, after they wrote about us in their little magazine and everything.  At least we got our article out of the way.  Yeah.  We got it up before things came out.  We wreck it, like our CD and stuff.  Like everything.  Like everything.  The January issue of Raw Magazine, we're in it.  But...  If you care.  I want everybody that goes to the Royal Rumble, which is at the Garden, live, pay-per-view,  it's going to be televised live, to bring Opie and Anthony rock signs. 
[149:00]
 Use your own imagination.  But they should just tear the rock a new a-hole.  How are you...  Hey, hey, suck any more fat out of your baloney boobs, Rock.  Things like that.  He had liposuction, you know.  He had man breasts.  Yeah.  But...  That's because he's Samoan, Opie.  You know how all Samoans have those big man breasts.  Why?  Why?  I thought Shane would, like, you know, be cool enough to at least call us.  I don't know.  Obviously there's a problem if Shane's going on, like, KTU and he's blowing us off in the 
[149:30]
 afternoon.  Maybe we're on the outs.  We're obviously on the outs.  Obviously.  Give us the courtesy of a call.  Is it like wrestling, though?  That we're on the outs or is it real life?  I think it's real life.  Oh.  I was hoping it was just like wrestling.  You think this is like a four-month bit?  Yeah, we're enemies now.  We're enemies and then all of a sudden they're going to call and go, oh, it's all right,  man.  We'll help you out.  We'll team up with Triple H.  I have Opie and Anthony.  You know.  You know, I haven't watched wrestling since that.  Really?  Yeah, just like...  I find it hard to watch the Royal Rumble.  I mean, I've watched it a couple of times.  I've watched it a couple of times. 
[150:00]
 I must say though.  He's such a douche, man.  He wrecked it.  He wrecked it, yeah.  And now he's...  We saw Superman without his cape and it wasn't fun.  Yeah.  We saw the man behind the curtain.  And it was just...  So now it's like whatever he says, like, oh, whatever.  And he's such a huge storyline now.  Like right after he did that, he became like the storyline.  He's the head of...  Like all the wrestlers got together against Triple H.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[150:30]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[151:00]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[151:30]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[152:00]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[152:30]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[153:00]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[153:30]
 And he's like, oh, I'm going to be the head of the team. 
[154:00]
 You're right. We hate you now. And hang up. That's it. And then at least we know. 
[154:30]

[155:00]
