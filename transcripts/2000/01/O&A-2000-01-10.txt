 I can't even believe these ones.  He's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony, on a douchebag.  Train wreck radio.  Bang-over!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  This is sicker than faces of death.  One-O-Two-Seven, W.N.E.W.  Opie and Anthony afternoon.  Mason and Kuliski morning.  The radio check midday.  On One-O-Two-Seven, W.N.E.W.  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that could choose stuff from a private area. 
[00:30]
 Hi, this is Louis Black from The Daily Show.  And you're listening to two of the most psychotic human beings I've ever met.  My pals, Opie and Anthony.  On One-O-Two-Point-Seven, W.N.E.W.  Alright, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're off to a flying start today.  If you want something, give us a call.  Two-One-Two-Seven-Five-Seven, One-O-Two-Seven.  Our fax line is working if you're working yourself today on this miserable Monday afternoon.  Fax line Two-One-Two-Nine-Five-Seven, Nine-Six-Three-Nine.  Want to get everyone in a good mood, a rockin' mood.  So we're going to take a quick musical break. 
[01:00]
 And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In the meantime, it's Metallica.  Old school.  Master of puppets.  Crank it up. It's One-O-Two-Seven-W.N.E.W.  One-O-Two-Seven-W.N.E.W.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Quick music break there.  Creed, my old president, Metallica, before that Master of Puppets.  Bunch of people bitching and complaining.  They don't like, uh... 
[01:30]
 We can't win with Metallica. They don't like the old Metallica.  They want the new Metallica.  You play the new Metallica, they want the old Metallica.  You can't win.  Can't win.  I guess eventually we're just going to have to stop playing music altogether.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Steve Seeff on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  He just checked in through the instant feedback.  A couple of very interesting things happening with the unofficial website.  First of all, the damn thing is going to reach a million hits this week. 
[02:00]
 Oh, we have to have a party.  We should have a party, is right.  Yeah.  A million hits on an unofficial website.  It was a little dream of Ant and I, you know, just to have a fansite that would just take off and...  A little outlet for some of the stuff we do here.  Get some pictures up so it's not just you listening to us with, uh, you know, nudies in here.  We get to see what they look like.  We like sharing with our audience.  Of course.  And it was open to everyone.  And Steve See came through and his site by far is the best one we've seen thus far without a doubt. 
[02:30]
 Yeah.  And at this point, Steve's being really cool because a lot of other listeners are starting ONA fansites  and Steve's linking it to the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  So that's pretty cool.  But it's going to reach a million hits this week, which is unbelievable because it only started in June.  Yeah.  Like what?  A little over seven months, million hits, not too shabby.  Considering we really haven't been able to give it out over the air.  It's truly on the line.  Because most of the time we're not allowed to say foundrymusic.com, Anthony.  So that's happening. 
[03:00]
 Also, um, he's going to be brave enough to put the rock confrontation on the Underground website.  Yeah, video, not just audio.  Video because Steve was in the studio the day we had the big confrontation with The Croc.  He videotaped the whole thing.  It is really awkward.  Once again, putting us putting us out there for all you to say.  That's right.  We definitely don't look good in that video.  And then he started a new segment on the unofficial website called The Girls of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:30]
 Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I guess girls email in their pictures.  Right.  To Steve.  Correct.  And he posts them.  Right.  It can't just be like if you're some guy and you've been cruising the websites and you find naked girls, you can't send it in and say, Hi, my name is, you know, Sue.  And this is me because they have to have some kind of ONA reference to it or, you know, there's got to be some kind of proof that it's you. 
[04:00]
 And what do we got here now?  We got Tammy, Tammy and Maya from Massachusetts.  We got Tammy.  Tammy's got a pretty hot bond on her.  Now, you know, I'm going to have to be honest, though, what Steve is looking for are true listeners of the Opie and Anthony Show.  So when the women do send the, you know, the shots of themselves into Steve's unofficial website, they got to prove they're a listener of the show by either holding up a WNEW or something that says Opie and Anthony.  So we can prove that you guys then just surf the Internet like you just said, and send in a really hot girl. 
[04:30]
 Maya obviously isn't a fan of our show, but I guess he's got to get this going somehow.  Yeah, because she's from Los Angeles and we're not syndicated to L.A. yet.  Yeah.  But Tammy, she's 20 years old from Massachusetts.  You know, we still have a ton of faithful listeners in the Boston area.  Matter of fact, WBCN up there started to play our bits, which is kind of nice.  And Tammy has sent in pictures of herself in lingerie from the unofficial website for the girls of the ONA show. 
[05:00]
 Rock.  Very, very cool section of the unofficial website.  Looking forward to seeing other women sending in their pictures to Steve's unofficial website.  And I think when Rick gets back from vacation, because Rick is heading off to London, I believe, today or tomorrow, what's Rick doing in London?  Ah, he's going on vacationing.  He's going with his wife and stuff.  Yeah, cute little, let's go overseas for four or five days. 
[05:30]
 And they just take a honeymoon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get them and get it all in now.  There you go.  We're going to bring back the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, bring that feature back.  But there you go.  So if you do check out the unofficial website anytime this week, definitely congratulate Steve on reaching a million hits.  We never thought it was possible.  Yeah.  And the damn guy, he's put in many, many, many, many hours on this website.  And we're pretty proud to say that it's pretty cool. 
[06:00]
 Hell yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  The phone's going nuts, Anthony.  We haven't gone to the phones in, wow, about an hour already.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll go right to the phones if you have something for the show.  Lots to get to today still.  Our phone number is 212-757-1027.  The fax line, 212-957-9639. 
[06:30]
 Hey, it's the O.P. and Anthony show on this dreary Monday afternoon.  Yeah, kind of miserable out.  Oh, nah.  It's all right, though.  Rainy.  I mean, Mondays suck in general.  Yeah.  And then to have this rain like this. 
[07:00]
 I guess it could be worse.  It could be snow.  I don't know.  I'm kind of wanting a little bit of snow.  You want some snow?  Well, you want a little bit, don't you?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't.  No?  That's a sign of age.  The older you get, you just don't want to deal with the snow.  Remember when you were young?  Yeah.  You wish you would snow like four or five feet at a time.  I don't care, though.  I want a little bit of snow this year.  Just something so I could drop my truck in it.  So you could feel good that global warming isn't taking over? 
[07:30]
 No, I don't care about that.  Just come on.  Get an SUV.  You want to kick the four-wheel drive in.  How funny is that?  When you had your other car?  Oh, my God, I had a cougar?  Yeah.  Oh, the thing would slip and slide if the temperature was like 35 degrees.  It didn't even have to be frozen out.  When we moved to Massachusetts to do radio for a few years,  and we're not from Boston, we're from here,  I don't know how many times we have to say,  but we're up there for three years, yeah, and had the cougar.  Yeah.  And it snowed like a mother up there. 
[08:00]
 Yeah, crazy.  And I had the SUV just tolling around and it's like,  oh, I can barely get out of parking spot.  I used to have to pull into parking spaces that weren't slightly dipped  toward the back because I would never get out.  I swear the slightest little incline, the wheels would just be spinning.  Oh, here's me by the house.  I can't get out.  How many times did you call me to try to get to work?  I know.  We had the worst winters up there. 
[08:30]
 And then spring hit and then you got me  because then you're tooling down the highway like going 100 in that damn car.  It's great.  It's like, oh, yeah, we're going up to New Hampshire or something.  I'll be up there in 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And I'll see you in two hours.  So now you trade that in, you get the SUV finally,  and you're not even going to be able to play around in the snow.  I know.  I was pissed with the cougar.  The speedometer went up to 140.  But there's some kind of governor that kicks in at 120 and shuts it.  I swear to God.  You couldn't go any faster.  I was like, oh, I was pissed.  I want to get up to 140 just to see what it feels like. 
[09:00]
 Yeah.  Why not?  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  Dave, what's going on?  All right.  Dave?  Sorry, guys.  I didn't even know it was on.  Yeah, let's go.  I was just saying the same thing Anthony said.  I was so pissed.  After that blizzard we had, I went and bought a four-wheel drive SUV.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to kick ass through the snow this year.  Two years it hasn't snowed.  What the hell happened?  Nothing.  What happened? 
[09:30]
 I don't know.  And there's no snow in the near future either.  No snow.  And I'm looking for it all the time just to kick in that four-wheel drive once.  Yeah.  I'm sure we'll get a little bit.  We always get jacked somewhere.  Maybe April.  You get those April blizzards.  That's what happens.  Then by April you don't want it to snow.  Now you just want spring to hit and all of a sudden you get like 18 inches of snow.  Gee, thanks.  Exactly.  We want the nice weather to come so we got the Whippamow Wednesday coming back. 
[10:00]
 Let me tell you something.  What are we up to, January 10th?  February.  God, we are less than three months away before we pop Whippamow Wednesday again.  Yeah.  Another thing, I got the sign of my SUV.  You know, the same thing.  Right.  There's nothing happening there, boy.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  All right, bye.  Take it easy, man.  Joseph, you're next.  What's going on?  I got a bone to pick with you.  Why?  Hope.  Why?  You're responsible for the outbreak.  The flu outbreak?  Oh, my God. 
[10:30]
 Why am I responsible?  Because you know what?  You're the first one that was talking about being sick.  Now, the entire world has it.  You know, I am so paranoid about this too because, I mean, you know...  You did it.  You breathe on my back and I get sick.  I know you.  I'm the worst.  I mean, I swear I got a routine.  I'm like the bubble boy at home.  You know, I refuse to go out.  I take the train and as soon as I come in, I scrub down with all these antibacterial soaps  and stuff. 
[11:00]
 I just don't want to get sick.  Dude, I got to tell you, I'm sitting here.  I'm on the computer in the porn sites.  Just nobody's home.  It's terrible.  I'm typing with one hand.  Why aren't you working today?  You're sick.  Oh, I'm so sick.  You wouldn't believe.  It's lying and it's your fault.  But you have time to, you know, surf for some porn.  Well, it's the only time my wife's not hoping.  You've got to keep yourself entertained.  You know, the day's longer.  You don't do it.  No, I...  You know, for the first time, I've been on the phone with my wife.  I've been on the phone with my wife.  I've been on the phone with my wife.  I've been on the phone with my wife.  I think I was the first person in New York to get this stupid flu, though. 
[11:30]
 It's a monster of a flu, too.  I got a note here.  Yeah?  I was sitting here at my...  Where I sat in the studio.  Anthony, Mason is sick again.  So I had to spray the mic.  You'll know immediately it isn't perfume. 
[12:00]
 Sorry, chick.  I don't...  Mason's sick again.  I don't understand why you don't get sick, Ann.  Well, I'll knock wood before I say anything.  When was the last time you were sick?  Do you even remember?  It was on the air.  Remember?  I took a day off and I think it was...  Had to be over a year ago.  Oh, yeah, definitely over a year ago.  It was when we first started here.  Right.  And you're sharing the mic with the morning guy.  I think I was constantly sick and has a snot and blood tissues all over your area, and  you're not getting sick.  Maybe it's... 
[12:30]
 I've built up like a superimmune system because of that.  You know, the stuff's right in my face all the time.  And I scrub down with the bacterial soap.  I don't touch anyone.  See?  And I get sick.  You're not allowing your body to build up the immunities.  That's what it is.  I eat well.  I don't eat junk.  I eat well, you know, and then I drink a few beers.  You got to do that, oh.  I've been drinking lately.  Oh, good.  I'm glad to hear it.  Better do a booze and up some tequila shots up in Boston this weekend. 
[13:00]
 What are you, crazy?  Well, as you know by now, Ann, I'm wheeling and dealing for the show.  Thank God.  I got, you know, important meetings in Boston.  Thank God someone is.  They're playing our bits now in Boston.  I'm making sure everything's OK.  So I'm running up there.  I guess the second.  The bosses up there.  We have another set of bosses we have to deal with now.  Well, see, I don't quite see it that way.  Because they're not paying us.  Yeah, I'll get involved when some money starts floating this way. 
[13:30]
 See, what you got to do is take a road trip to Boston because know what's happening?  Yeah.  I am reaping all the benefits and you're not because I go up there and I'm wheeling and dealing.  I'm like, hey, I'm going to send more of our bits so you guys can play it on the air and stuff.  We're like an artist up there.  We're like a we're like a band because what they're doing is they're like playing like the OJ 911 phone call, let's say.  OK, wow.  And they're playing it like it's a song.  So we're like an artist.  We're getting spins on WBCN in Boston. 
[14:00]
 They just play us throughout the whole day.  We are like an artist.  We're getting screwed.  We're not seeing any money for our labors.  So what I want to tell you, though, if we are truly like an artist, you definitely got to take a road trip up there because I'm reaping the benefits because I wheel and deal.  I give them the new bits and stuff and and I find out what's going on with our bits and how they're being perceived up there.  And what do you get out of it?  I then I go out to the you know, for a nice dinner.  Oh, see, you're really something out of it.  I don't have to pay for anything.  Wow.  Damn you.  Slamming down the tequila and.  Yeah, what's up with that? 
[14:30]
 I can never, ever get you to do shots ever.  It's the new new millennium, the new new millennium, the new hopes are drunk.  That's right.  I'm putting the heroin aside.  I'm going back to booze tequila though.  That stuff will kick your ass, man.  You know what?  The problem is with tequila.  I don't you know, we're picking out a tequila this weekend, right?  Yeah, it's like, you know, the Quaribos like the basic cheap stuff and one of the bosses like, no, no, we want your we want your best tequila. 
[15:00]
 Right.  Yeah. And I just hate tequila in general.  And it still tastes like crap.  Really?  Yeah.  See, because the Sammy Hagar tequila is good.  That wasn't bad.  I got it.  I like that stuff.  What the hell was it called again?  The Cabo Abo tequila?  Yeah, something like that.  That wasn't bad.  But the stuff I had, I mean, it was real expensive stuff.  And I was still like, this is just as bad as Quaribos.  The salt and the lemon and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How many would you say you just.  Honestly, just a couple. 
[15:30]
 Couple.  Yeah.  And just then a few margaritas.  I mean, I was not was lit.  Tequila night.  I was lit.  Plans for us in Boston.  Do they?  You don't want to bore our New York audience, but it's kind of exciting for our New York  audience too, because a lot of you guys are part of the bids we've sent up there.  So now, a couple of you guys have been heard in Boston as well.  So you're part of our little syndication game we're playing here.  I'm sure they'll all want cash for it too.  Yeah, I guess the next time I go up there, I got to start talking money.  I just feel bad.  I'm the stupidest man on the face of the earth.  Remember me?  I called for that landscaping job.  Well, I'm not that stupid.  I'm a little desperate.  Right?  I do be a little desperate for money.  Well, yes.  Yeah, I don't know. I guess the next time I go up there I gotta start talking money.  I just feel bad.  Hi, I'm the stupidest man on the face of the earth. Remember me? I called for that landscaping 
[16:00]
 job. Well, I'm not that stupid. I really want some cash.  Oh, we haven't played that bit in a while.  No, we had a dreads night.  All we should do is call Boston maybe sometime this week to see how our bits are doing. We'll  call the radio station that is playing our stuff to see how we're received.  See how we're received.  All right.  Why not?  I'm into doing that.  Yeah, phones are nuts and, ah, shoot. We'll take one more call before we take another  break. Tommy, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys? How you doing?  All right. 
[16:30]
 Yeah, check it out, man. I went out. I took the frozen bill of roar, right?  Yeah.  In North Star Engine, okay? The magazine that I read, you know, I read all the reviews, said  the car would do 154 miles an hour. Compared it to the Caddies, the whole bit. I'm headed  down to Lake City one night, it's late. I got a call with a people. I'm flying down,  So I'm like, I'm going to open this bad boy up, hit 100, nice, nice and smooth. No problem.  Yeah.  Hit 110, no problem. Going great. We'll laugh and have a good time. Got the radio up. I  hit 112, I thought I hit a brick wall, man. That frigging thing died on me. 
[17:00]
 Yeah, the engine just goes boom.  It goes boom. Like, what the hell?  Like, what the hell, man?  I was pissed.  I was pissed.  I know exactly how you feel. It's like riding all smooth. You know you could go another  20 miles an hour faster without the thing rattling apart or anything.  Oh, really, man?  Yeah.  The governor just kicks in and the engine goes boom.  It's dead, man.  It shuts down.  I'm not confused with that. I'm looking for the governor.  Yeah, there's got to be something on it.  I cannot find it. Anyway, guys, love this show. I got to run. I'm working.  All right, guys.  Here you go.  All right, guys.
