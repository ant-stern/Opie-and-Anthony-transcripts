 Reporters are doing live shots  All the reporters are down at that Seton Hall fire today  Yeah, try I mean it's tragic, but there's a great opportunity there. Oh my god. What?  capitalizing on that  Well, I'm just saying you know you see the TV crews in your in your neighborhood  Yeah, I hear you get on TV with the wow sign jump up and down like a little tick like psychomarck  We're hoping to spawn more psychomarcks, and then we'll get the footage on the unofficial website  We'll have a nice section on the unofficial website people getting on TV with wow signs 
[00:30]
 So far so far. We've been on MTV Anthony and CBS  We want to be on every single station before every one of them before spring damn it  And we want to be on all these stations many many times  We'll even have a contest and stuff  We'll get enough of these and then we'll have like the listeners vote for the the craziest guy  Yeah, making a fool of himself. You know behind the reporter  Oh, that was it turn transient to comedy over there seat, huh John. What's up? 
[01:00]
 All right, I got a question you guys watching American music watch the other night  I watched it for exactly 30 seconds, and that was when Britney Spears was on  Thank you guys  She's too young to wear that she's no she's not too young at all  She's a  I'm sorry. I missed the show yesterday. I heard about the MTV thing  I wish I'd seen psycho mark doing it, but I was in my bedroom still recovering from Britney Spears 
[01:30]
 If you know what I mean that outfit last night was unbelievable. Oh god. I was like  My room is still sticky  Once I was going to put these  Comes on  Let me tell you something I'm not into Aguilera I'm not into Jennifer Thompson is the new one  I'm into Britney Spears and it's so funny because she sings all these cute little songs about having high school crushes 
[02:00]
 And the reality is there's guys in their mid-30s just whack it into the video  Fun bags like sag just a little too much. No, they're perfect  Please like you would complain  Look at the front bags check about six inches lower. That's a different thing altogether. Yeah, I will go in the house  All right, John. Jesus. Thank you 
[02:30]
 But you know that's the truth, you know  She has all these like cute little high school gas videos and songs  Uh-huh, and the fact is there ain't a guy looking at her  Doesn't matter what the age is that wouldn't want to pounce on her right and that's all any any guys thinking when they watch those videos  She's there with her cute little hat on and and you know blah blah blah  You want to see her rip open that shirt she had on hell yeah little pop she was wearing just a matter of time  We just got to pray her career goes bad in two years and she'll be in playboy  Yeah, that's all you got to do is wait for them to become has-beens 
[03:00]
 And then all of a sudden the playboy offers a mill or something opposed and there you go. You got your naked pics  You got a hope you know to become has-beens before they get too old though, like maybe Anna Koronikova. Ha when she  Gives up tennis we could only wish naked I  Think Britney Spears doesn't for me more than Anna Koronikova now really yeah. Oh, yeah, I think they're different  There's a big difference between the two. I don't know. I'm still waiting for the the little Olsen twins stand up and playboy 
[03:30]
 Well, we're getting there that'll happen. What's the countdown down?  It's gotta be what we have a countdown going in and I started this like what like five years ago  Yeah, yeah, five years ago. We did the  The when can we have a legal threesome with the Olsen twins?  And I believe they were  13 at the time  No, I think they were younger at the time. I think they're 13 now. No, no, they're up there  I think they're close like 15 at this point really well if anyone has that info 
[04:00]
 Yeah, we do we need that today need to check it off on our charge a Pete. You're next on WNEW. What's up?  Alright, I just want to know if you know but the Rock is hosting on MTV today total request live  Yeah, we do know that that's why we had the sneak attack yesterday with Psycho Mark because we were thinking maybe people would be on  Tests today.

Yeah to be in the studio tomorrow for the rock interview  They will be call us pussies if you like  But one's gonna stand directly behind Anthony and one directly behind my back our bodyguards  I'm gonna have two bodyguards tomorrow for the interview with the rock. I think we need them  Well, cuz we don't know what the hell's gonna happen tomorrow 
[05:30]
 Yeah, all we know is the rock is gonna be on our show tomorrow sometime after five o'clock. That's all we know  I guess he has a couple other things he's got to do  So that's why they can't nail down an exact time. So, you know, I'd like to protect me might sound a little weird  Cardinal O'Connor I could hide behind that huge head that he has now  Come on. No, come on. No you come on open up open up the post to page four. What is that?  It's a huge melon what happened 
[06:00]
 That's a to Cardinal O'Connor. That's life right there in oh my god  He looks like uncle Fester in a Cardinal outfit  He dedicated his life to the Catholic faith and this is how he gets to go out  He turns brain tumors and a huge head turns 80 on Saturday. Maybe you ought to lock himself out on a roof  Freeze to death  but yeah, you dedicate your life to a god and  And and look what how he pays you back 
[06:30]
 You're 80 and he gives you a brain tumor and and makes it look like someone shoved an air pump in your ear  All right, oh wow, look at that 62 pounds per square inch a little over pressure  Come on, Cardinal's heads ready to pop the cardinal. Why is it like that?  Is that the the chemotherapy or something? There's a water on the brain  I don't remember his head being that big a year ago. No, even when he had hair on it 
[07:00]
 mmm, I mean, I think they had to let out his uh  That yarmulke a skull cat thingy wears know what what he looks like  The the mutant creature from South Park with the big head from one of the first episodes  What the hell is the name of that like the evil?  Was it Stan or Kyle  Remember that  The name of the head with the big head that the the scientists there on the top of the hill made they cloned him  Yeah, and his head was you know extra big 
[07:30]
 It's terrible, but you know god the guy dedicated his life to the the Lord and look at where he ends up life isn't fair  Anthony's falling down when he's given his little services and stuff. Remember when we played what did we learn on the show today?  Life is not fair Wayne. What's up?  Real good  Why what happened? I can't do anything between two and seven.

 Hey, Anthony, Priceline.com. 
[12:30]
 Yes, we've saved plenty of money on our hotels and airfare.  Now groceries, Opie.  You can buy groceries through Priceline.  You go to the website, Priceline.com, and you shop for things.  You shop for every day, you know, beef, chicken, soda, cereal, coffee, even diapers for the  little wee ones.  And you name your own price for those things.  And then you print out these prepaid coupons that you name your own price for.  You take it to A&P, ShopRite, Wallbounds, King Collin, Gristides, Dagestinos, Food Emporium,  hundreds of stores everywhere you shop. 
[13:00]
 And you pay your own price for those groceries.  Yeah, that's the huge thing, to do it with groceries.  Got to say though, Ant, saved 50 bucks myself today.  We're doing the WWF premiere tonight, right?  Yeah.  We're going to the restaurant, big party.  And I figured I should stay in town tonight.  Popped on to Priceline.com, saved 50 bucks on a hotel room tonight.  Easy as that.  Without even trying.  It was a piece of cake.  You just see what the normal price is, and then you knock like, I hope, did 50 bucks off? 
[13:30]
 Yeah, I didn't even, honestly, I didn't even try.  You probably could have knocked 100 bucks off.  Probably, I didn't even really try.  I was in a hurry, and I just quickly did it, and it took no time at all.  So it's airline tickets, hotel rooms, now groceries, and up to half off.  Just log on to Priceline before you go to the store.  Priceline for groceries, it's bigger than big.  www.priceline.com.  1027WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today. 
[14:00]
 Our fax line, 212-957-9639, if you're working and you want to send something into the program today.  It is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah, a little cold.  A little cold?  We say like once a week, you know, just to acknowledge that it still happens.  Don't want to spend too much time on Whip-Em-Out Wednesday until the spring hits.  But it is a all-around, an all-year thing there.  Yeah.  We don't take off in the winter, okay?  No, but once spring hits, everybody is all euphoric with spring, and the boobs just come 
[14:30]
 blooming out like the flowers.  Correct, Anthony.  And it's very easy.  You put a wow on your car and a lot of the faithful ladies of this radio show will flash  you if they see the wow signs on your car.  Yeah.  The one thing I do want to mention about Whip-Em-Out Wednesday before we move on with the show,  a lot of people asking for the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday window stickers, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We don't have many of those left.  We're going to get a whole brand new design for this coming, you know, spring.  Why you didn't like my old design? 
[15:00]
 The last sticker blew.  Really did.  And it was part of the old regime.  God.  We wanted like a, you know, a blood red, you know, logo on a yellow background.  It comes back like orange.  Orange.  And we're like, look, this is not what we wanted.  Well, it's too late.  We have 60,000 like this.  60,000 window clings.  It's like, well, how many stickers did you order?  Just regular stickers.  Oh, no stickers.  Just window clings.  It's like, well, what about like trucks and stuff that don't have back windows? 
[15:30]
 What about tinted windows that you can't see?  Like I have a wow sticker in my back window.  Can't see it.  My back window is so tinted, you cannot even see the wow.  What are you wearing?  What are you driving Puffy's truck?  I'm driving Puffy's truck and I know where my little trap is.  Trap, trap.  Did you read that in the paper?  Yeah, all the gangsters have traps in their cars.  The trap, man.  It was like such a sophisticated vehicle.  They got all the sports utility vehicles.  And Puffy and Jennifer Lopez and his driver driving away from this place where the shooting was. 
[16:00]
 And they're trying to find the trap, which is the place you drop your gun and then shut the trap door and no one finds the gun.  It's a hidden secret James Bond like compartment.  No one knew where the trap was in this vehicle.  So they're all yelling, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap.  Where the trap?  Let me just stick it in Jennifer's ass.  That's a big ass trap you got there, Jennifer Lopez.  Oh brother. 
[16:30]
 So they couldn't find the trap.  That's funny.  So I mean we're going to get the wow stickers.  We're going to do them right this season.  But if you want one of the old ones, a lot of people email us about that.  You can send a self-addressed envelope and the gang will send one out to you, okay?  Yeah.  That's WIDW, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York.  I don't know what the zip is.  10106.  Was that it?  Yeah, 10th floor by the way is well on there, okay?  We'll remember that.  Let's go back to the phones and see what's going on here. 
[17:00]
 Mike, you're next on the radio show. What's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  All right.  I just got to ask you, this whole rock situation now.  Yeah.  Is this all some cheap cross promotion with some WWF show that's going to be on the station on Saturday nights?  Well, that's what David Hinckley likes to think.  I guess he wrote about it again today in the Daily News.  I'm not kidding.  We had no idea that we were carrying the WWF show this Saturday night from what, 8 to 10 or something like that?  We are.  Something like that.  I swear. I had to read about it in the paper today.  I swear a lot of people are thinking that this is some huge cross promotion. 
[17:30]
 It is not.  And if it becomes a huge plug tomorrow, we will kick them out of the studio.  You know?  Can I make one more request for tomorrow?  Yeah.  Can you keep on playing that half-breed don't like it song every 15 minutes?  Yeah. Actually a new one came in today.  Oh, a new rock song.  Yeah, it's called Rock is a Homo. We don't even know who sent it in.  No, we don't know who that is.  Some guy, I forgot his name.  Thank you for helping, man. 
[18:00]
 That means we don't know who it is.  Alright, man. The Rock is coming in tomorrow sometime after 5.  Alright.  Alright, bro.  Thanks a lot.  You want to hear this song? You haven't heard it yet.  No.  It's a quickie. It's like 40 seconds long. It's called Rock is a Homo song.  Rock. 
[18:30]
 Do you smell what the rock breed is cooking?  Jesus, man.  Not a bad effort. Very good. Whoever sent that.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Alright. I just read that now. 
[19:00]
 What of Hinckley?  In the Daily News about us?  God, you know what the thing is? You could think that it was all like a big publicity stunt.  But I swear to you, I mean, come on. We're not BSO over here.  We've never done a big publicity stunt on purpose.  No, we don't like doing things like that.  Half the crap we do end up becoming big publicity stunts, but we didn't try to make it happen that way.  We had a meeting, what, yesterday about how do we handle, part of the meeting was how are we going to handle this when the rock comes in? What are we going to do? 
[19:30]
 And some of the suggestions that were coming in from other people at work here, I said, no, it sounds too much like it's a put on.  Like we're trying to make this a, like we planned it or something.  I'm going to call him a crybaby. I'm going to tell him that, you know.  You better watch what you say now because the listeners will call you on it, man.  I don't care. I'm going to though. I have to.  Call him a crybaby?  I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't say that after the last time. We punked out last time, man. We punked out last time. 
[20:00]
 That's the rock.  Yeah, that's the rock.  Little crybaby.  Oh man.  And we're going to have two huge cops behind us. The cops have our backs.  All right.  I got one for you and one for me.  That's good.  So we'll be able to pretty much say whatever we want.  I'm a little frightened though still.  When you see these cops, Ed, you're not going to be frightened at all.  And if you want to call us pussies for getting two huge humongous cops to get our backs, then you can call us a puss. 
[20:30]
 We're not stupid.  We're not stupid.  This is kind of cool. So we can like say anything to them, I guess.  That's what I'm thinking.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you doing?  Good.  You guys killed me yesterday. I'm driving home cracking up.  And then I remembered. I got this little TV, about a five-incher, that also plugs into the lighter thing in the car.  Oh yeah?  I'm like, oh. So here I come to work this morning. I'm walking down the hall in the office. I got it under my arm. 
[21:00]
 I go to my desk, plug it in. Here comes my boss.  What's that for?  What do you mean, what's this for?  I got to watch every goddamn newscaster there is now.  People are bringing TVs to work to listen to our show.  So you guys got me in a little trouble there.  That's funny.  I also want to suggest that people start hitting the 11 o'clock newscasts for those of us who aren't home at 5 o'clock.  Not a bad idea.  Well, I mean, Mark did MTV yesterday and they re-ran that last night. 
[21:30]
 I didn't catch that. I didn't know they were re-running it.  If you got a computer, man, there's a whole montage of Mark on MTV in the background with the wow sign on the unofficial opening.  Okay, I didn't check that out yet today. I got to check that out.  It's very funny. Don't have anything in your mouth. You'll spit it out.  You guys have any rumble tickets left?  You got me in trouble a little?  I don't even know if we're giving out rumble tickets.  I'll check with Rick when we go into commercial, right?  Can I hang?  No, call back.  All right. 
[22:00]
 Because we'll give them away later if we have them.  All right. Good luck tomorrow.  All right, man. Thanks.  Bye-bye.  So I guess The Rock has started his little TRL appearance on MTV, Anthony.  Yes.  Evan, what's going on?  What's going on, pal?  All right.  Listen, I'm watching this half-read right now of The Rock on TV and I'm sick of him. I hate him.  You guys, listen, you need to send Psycho Mark down there. You have to. You have to today. The Rock. Oh my God.  Well, he might be there already. You never know. Never know.  I'm watching. I need to see him. And tomorrow, listen, these cops, they're going to have guns. 
[22:30]
 We'll see. We'll see what they bring with them. All right?  Yeah, all right, buddy.  All right, Evan. Thank you.  We made the Yahoo Magazine again.  Okay.  The actual magazine. They print the results of their adasia.com ratings.  The most talked about stuff. We came in sixth.  Sixth?  Yeah.  What beat us out?  Right under the Linux operating system. 
[23:00]
 And George W. Bush.  The Amiga operating system. That's great.  Boy, but we beat out John McCain, presidential candidate. We beat out Microsoft Windows 98.  Very good.  And wait, we also beat out the Linux operating system. But number five was the Linux operating system network version. 
[23:30]
 See, we didn't beat that out.  So we're the six most talked about thing on dasia.com.  On dasia.com. Isn't that hysterical?  That's pretty sad.  That is real sad. All right. Very good. Keep talking about us. We don't care.  Let's go to Paul. Paul, what's going on today?  Hey, Owen, hey.  You guys are awesome.  Hey, thank you.  I've been trying to get through to you forever.  Cool.  I'm always on hold. I want to tell you, me and my buddy Jay just got wowed on this concert highway in Long Island. 
[24:00]
 Oh, awesome. Route 347?  Yeah, Long Island.  Yeah, we know where that is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Cool.  Well, congratulations.  Thanks. First time I got wowed.  Well, I knew it was still happening, even though it's not that warm out.  A little chilly to be popping your nips out.  Thank you, Paul.  They're still popping them out in there, hard as ever.  All right, man.  All right.  It's happening as we speak.  Louis, you're next on WNEW. What's up?  Louis!  Hello?  Turn down your radio. You're on the radio. What's up?  What's up? 
[24:30]
 Listen, I got a call before and say you got the CD?  Yeah.  I saw it in Coconut, a union in New Jersey.  New Jersey?  Yeah.  There's only three copies left. I mean, now there's just two left.  They never had more than three copies to begin with. Every store I've seen it in, it's like two copies.  They have you next to the Christian music and adult contemporary.  Oh, okay.  So I don't know what's up with that.  That's the other thing, because I find out record stores that do carry the MetaWorld CD,  which is all that. We don't want to trick anyone. It's two years old, but we're still proud of it.  But it's really hard to find in the record stores. 
[25:00]
 People still ask for it.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Thank you, man.  You guys are cool.  All right, man.  Oh, B, we actually got an age on the Olsen twins. I know. I saw that.  13?  I didn't want to bring it up.  No, well, we're obviously not saying we're jumping on the Olsen twins,  but we have a countdown to when you could have a legal threesome with the Olsen twins.  You think we'll still be at NAW when they turn 18?  Oh, this place is known for keeping jocks for years and years.  Yeah, I would guess we might still be here. But what do we got, five years? 
[25:30]
 Five years to go.  Five years and counting.  All right.  A couple more people on and tell where our CD is. JP, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Yo, Empire Records on Stewart Avenue by Roosevelt Field.  How many copies?  They got like five copies.  Oh, all right.  All right, JP, thank you.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Later.  I guess it's out there a little bit, huh?  Yeah.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, O.A., how you doing?  Great.  I found your copy of your CD at Smokin' Sounds in Stanford, Connecticut. 
[26:00]
 Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a small store.  That's pretty.  It's not a big store, but they had it.  Little mom and pop store.  Well, I'm not a mom and pop, but yeah, something like that.  All right, well, thank you.  Hey, take it easy.  All right, Dave.  Is that a train?  No, you better not.  If we continue taking calls from people telling us, you know, where they found our CD, it  could be a huge train wreck show, so yeah.  Let's take a break.  Anthony will regroup and we'll be back. 
[26:30]
