 Unfortunately, subroutines tunnel isàyo bichu开iliwエy  T졏 T油 le Hold your letter dot com Okay, go ahead.  Yo-go, already baseball time except you're money hot.  What are you having fun with?  Gobbledag or whatever?  Phenomenal budget pho.  If you could bleep it, gobbledag by gold if you could bleep it.  The bbq is local bone but the raises are leafé.  Please know that as you go work in Salisbury or mikä vest shtaw, you got to put them in  their shoes without dialing 911.  OK?  I want it all.  No, no, no, don't think that.  No, no, no. 
[04:30]
 Is there anyone hurt?  Need rescue?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  I love, don't make me get in a Bronco.  Now, what does he do?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh no, 911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something, and then 911 usually calls back.  Okay, so here's the second...  Hello, OJ House?  Oh, police.  Hang out.  I want you to call the police.  Hello? 
[05:00]
 This is the deuce.  Now what happened?  I don't know.  You hear OJ going, I want you to call the police.  I had a hitter over the head with the phone receiver and we were disconnected.  I like him!  Hello?  This is the police department.  Oh, Steve, I don't know what to do about it.  Man, it's quite frustrating.  This guy, Faisal Guerrero, got loathed by a guy, arrested by having 15 keys and cocaine.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him.  Me and her friend just came over and said, you're going into a rehab. 
[05:30]
 She got mad, she just got her car, she drives a Mercedes, she listens to car scenes.  Now she is loaded out of her mind in her Mustang driving around town.  What other car is that?  It's a driver's license number, but you need to be stopped.  What color is the Mustang?  It's white.  Like a Bronco.  Is he black or white?  He's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go into your bike and find her.  That's all I did, a white girl. 
[06:00]
 This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's diving.  OJ calls 911.  Is OJ putting out a prank call tag?  Is that what's going on here?  The best OJ.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  OJ calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running now?  Yes it is. 
[06:30]
 Well you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes we do.  Well you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  All of yours now. 
[07:00]
 Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10 pound balls?  Yes we do.  How do you walk?  You'll skip a bit, the OJ Simpson.  You'll skip a bit, the OJ Simpson.  I gotta go now, I gotta find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh? 
[07:30]
 I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug prank call.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  He's not alone with your favorite murderer, OJ.  Number one?  Yes?  Butt plug.  Bug box? 
[08:00]
 Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plugs, butt plugs.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does OJ do any character voices on his prank call tape?  Kind of like the Jerky Boys?  I come down there with my tube box.  I bash your head in with a ratchet or a knife. 
[08:30]
 I'm OJ.  Oops, I just put myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  I better fly to Chicago.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  All of yours now.  Freaking OJ, man.  He's back, I love him.

[12:30]
 And it's FU Friday, hello, hello, hello  Hey man  What's going on Anthony?  What are you hacking in?  Not much, not much at all  I only had about a hundred messages on my machine when I got home last night  My brother, it was hilarious, Brett was, he felt so bad for us  Because if anyone's like a fan of your show  Our show obviously  They would know how much  Before yesterday we looked up to The Rock 
[13:00]
 Kind of liked The Rock  Even though we're in our 30s he's like a superhero in our eyes  We really really enjoyed  Very entertaining to watch  What he did for the WWF  And we admired the guy and all that  And then just to have what happened yesterday, Toast  That's what my brother felt worse about than anything that actually went on on the show  Oh yeah, that was a little rough yesterday 
[13:30]
 It was kind of like seeing Superman without his cape and no one wants to see that ever  I don't know, I have to mull it over for a night  Thinking about it  It kind of pisses me off a little bit  I've lost all respect for The Rock  And I can care less what he does in the WWF from this moment on  Yeah, it's like  I don't know, I don't think that was necessary  I think he could have gotten more of his facts straight  I think he made up his mind and walked without really knowing what the real deal was 
[14:00]
 You know?  Well I guess we're going to play the uncomfortable  Oh are we?  The uncomfortable part of the interview  Oh no  Just because the response on it is just unbelievable  We're going to do it a little later though because Lewis Black is coming in here at 3.30  Later on in the show we'll definitely rehash the whole thing  But you know what?  I mean my blood today is absolutely boiling  It really is because we were blindsided 
[14:30]
 I swear to you and I said it right to his face man to man  I had no freaking idea what he was saying  And that is the God's honest truth  He was expecting us to just trash Sickboy in front of his face  We didn't have any of the facts at the time or anything  Let me tell you something about my side of this whole thing  I visit Sickboy's site a lot  The X Wrestling 
[15:00]
 And I've seen what's on the site  You know what it is?  It's satire, it's comedic writing, it's funny  And it is really politically incorrect  To talk about goofing on everybody  I mean everything  You could go there and see the writers on that site  Goofing on gays, Jews, blacks, everybody, Italians  Doesn't matter  That's what that site is about 
[15:30]
 Now on the other hand like he said or asked  No we don't have anything to do with the site  I enjoy going there like I enjoy going to thousands of websites  I don't think he understands that that's what that site is about  And we didn't have anything to do with it  But that doesn't even matter at this point  Sickboy is a guest on our show as was The Rock  As was Jeffrey Ross that day  You know we don't screen our guests 
[16:00]
 To see who they're either affiliated with  Or what businesses they own or anything  They come on our show  If they do good radio, if we like them  They will return, that's it  I did some research on Jeffrey Ross  I didn't know he was a kid toucher  Oh my God  If I knew he was a kid toucher  We wouldn't have him in yesterday  That is absolutely false  I don't even know what you're talking about  Jeffrey I'm just kidding  Just kidding Mr. Ross  Sickboy guest on our show 
[16:30]
 Like a bunch of other guests that we've had in the past  That's all  No biggie Rock  He didn't have to freak out like that  He had a biggie issue with him  I don't care how blown up he is  And how big he is  Not today because he's not here  No but he truly in my eyes  He's not even a man  And I'll tell you why  Because after the segment was over  And we went into commercials  And I told them what I knew about the situation 
[17:00]
 And explained his point of view  Any other man would at least stick around  And maybe discuss it for five minutes  Maybe  But what did this big huge mother do  He just turns around and walks right out  Without even giving us a chance to discuss this further  I'm not going to lay into him  I don't give a crap  I'm so freaking pissed today  Let me tell you why  Because it seems like you're being a pussy 
[17:30]
 If you talk like that when he's not sitting here  So I'm not going to do that  I'll give him the forum to come back today  He's in the area  I'm not a pussy  If the rock wants to come in today  And we'll discuss this further  That proves I'm not a pussy  I know he's still in town  He's doing another book signing tomorrow  Or today, I don't know  So if he wants to call in that's great too  But he's not even a man in my eyes  Because he wouldn't discuss it further after  We left the radio show 
[18:00]
 After the commercials  They all just ran out of here  That is what I am pissed off about  And if he really wants to get on this racism soapbox of his  Why doesn't he look within the company he works for  And by saying that  I am totally for what the WWF does  But if he really is that concerned  He makes a pretty good living  From a company that exploits stereotypes  Let's face it 
[18:30]
 And I have no problem with that  No problem  It's entertaining  We exploit stereotypes on this radio show  It's funny  It is funny  Like it's funny when you watch it on WWF  And you see the Godfather come out  And he's dressed like a pimp  And he's pimping hoes  And smoking weed  You know, I mean, come on  That's not a stereotype  I hear on the Rock's website  He has a whole section on trail apart trash 
[19:00]
 Some people would find that very offensive, Rock  Right  I don't know  But I swear to God  I am so freaking pissed today  And right after the show  One of the representatives from the WWF  Left me a voicemail  And I called her right back  Because I was still like  What the hell, I'll discuss this  But I don't even want to discuss it anymore  But I got her on the phone  And she goes  We heard the rest of the show after we left 
[19:30]
 And we're not pleased whatsoever  And she was convinced  That we controlled the phone calls  And just made  So the people that were on  Would agree with what we were saying  That's not what we did whatsoever  There were plenty of calls of people  That say we acted wrong  Or we looked stupid  Or we were the a-holes  We put those through too  What do you think?  We censor the calls?  No 
[20:00]
 And it's too bad  But what about the rock now?  Yeah  Hmm  What about?  Steve from the unofficial website  Who was in the studio yesterday  Steve, what's going on?  What's up fellas?  I liked your posting on the unofficial website today  About this whole thing  Yeah, you know, I got home last night  Talked to Sick for a couple minutes  And needless to say he was a little shocked  You know, still about the whole thing 
[20:30]
 I know he hung with you guys for a while  I went home and went right for the wine  Big bottle of red  Yeah, that was a little stressful  To be perfectly honest  But you know something in retrospect  That guy, had he known about it  Which it certainly sounds like he did  He should have said something  He should have said something to you guys about it  And he didn't handle himself very well  And any amount of apologizing  Wasn't going to change his mind  And that's what sucked about it  Well that's fine 
[21:00]
 But I mean, why don't you be a man  And call us today  Yeah, exactly  Because I told him the truth  I had no freaking idea about this  I mean he lumbered out of there  Like a 280 pound crybaby  For lack of a better analogy  Exactly  And how many racial stereotypes  Does this guy use in his wrestling matches  Personally I don't know  I mean, I could give you all sorts of info on that  But it's whatever  I mean, if he really wants to get 
[21:30]
 Into this issue  He should look right where he's working  Yeah, exactly  You know why he never will though  Because he makes way too much money  Oh exactly  And it's political to a very large extent  And then he can look like he cares  About those issues by bashing  Some guy's website or a radio show  Of course  And you know, the fact that he made  Some blind assessment about the whole situation  Hadn't seen the post himself  You know, he was going by what people told him 
[22:00]
 You know, and I'm sure  I'm sure there were racially insensitive things  That were said on it  You know, because that's what  Sick said after looking at it  But he erased it immediately  The fact that he persisted  In having a temper tantrum about it  After he was apologized to  You know what  Sick Boy shouldn't even have to erase it  What happened to freedom of speech in this country  Yeah, slowly diminishing  Especially on the internet  You may not like what you read 
[22:30]
 You know  I always thought the internet might  You know, earlier in the early days of the internet  Back in the early to mid 90s  You know  I thought that would end up being like  The last bastion of free speech  You know what I mean  Like, because you'd go on there  And just, man, it didn't matter  Sometimes you'd punch up something  Read it and just be offended yourself  But just the fact that it was there  I mean, it's an open forum  It shouldn't be controlled 
[23:00]
 You know, you're not making money  Suing somebody  Complaining about it  And making a couple thousand lawyers rich  And you do anything successful on the internet  And you're going to get fleeced  It's ridiculous  And the fact that he even had to  I mean, removing stuff from websites  Because some people find it offensive  I mean, what's next?  For Christ's sake  And then like, guilty by  I hate this guilty by association  So now, okay, obviously you have a problem 
[23:30]
 And you're like, what does Sickboy did?  So now you instantly hate us because he's in the studio?  Wait, not Sickboy  No, a writer on his site  It wasn't even Sickboy who posted that  All right, so it's a writer on Sickboy's site  So then immediately  Somehow he should hate us as well  Right  Exactly, well, whatever  That makes a lot of sense  Why don't you start doing some background checks  On all the people that are around you, Rock  You might be very surprised  Well, you know, again  I mean, I didn't do any research on this 
[24:00]
 And didn't do any more research  Other than whatever information they gave him  You know, and then just walked in here  And didn't mention it beforehand  Until he was introduced to Sick, you know  Right  And that wasn't cool  Right  That wasn't cool  And he didn't handle himself very well  Poor form on his part  Well, you know, if you didn't want to get into it on the air  Well, you know, we did go right to commercials  Yeah  And he was like, I don't know  I don't know if he was going to shake my hand or something 
[24:30]
 But he just turned around and walked out  And gave me that look  And turned around and walked out  It's like, man, you know  And that kind of pisses me off  You know what, you're looking at me  Sorry, I cursed  Looking at me like I'm Mr. F and KKK or something  Yeah, I know  You know, that pisses me off  It was a temper tantrum  It was a temper tantrum  You know, however you want to look at it  I don't want to play with you anymore  You know, and that's childish 
[25:00]
 That's childish  And it's a shame it had to happen live  And that the guy couldn't handle himself a little bit better  Well, I don't mind that it happened live  It was interesting radio to say the least  I mean, no one turned off the radio yesterday  I'm quite sure that's the case  I don't enjoy being in those situations  But it makes for a good listen when you're in your car  No, that was definitely the most awkward silence I have ever been a part of  And then you're trying to think as quick as possible 
[25:30]
 To come up with something  Yeah, exactly  But I was just so shocked because this came out of left field  I mean, my famous line  What happened? I thought we all just having fun here  Exactly  And then poof  You're total deer in the headlights  Oh my God, I just got hit  And I had nothing to do with it  You were on the Opie and Anthony show  You weren't on the Sick Boy show  You weren't on a wrestling site show  You know what I mean?  You were on our show 
[26:00]
 And God damn it, we had nothing to do with it  And that's what sucks about the whole situation  Is that the guy didn't want to listen  The guy didn't want to be apologized to  He wanted to have his temper tantrum  I looked at him right in the eye  I said, dude, I had no freaking idea  No idea  Didn't seem that there was much getting through to this guy  But a good posting on your own official website about it  Very good, Steve  The truth of the matter is  Even if we did have an idea of what was on that site 
[26:30]
 It still doesn't matter  It still doesn't matter  Because you read something offensive on a website  Then you're responsible for it  Or you should have to be held accountable for it  Please  There is some degree of responsibility one must take  When you go into this thing  Understandably, Sick didn't write it  But it's like if one of the writers on the unofficial site  And they're all great guys  Frank, Joe, Josh 
[27:00]
 If one of them all of a sudden  Spewing forth racially incentive remarks  People are going to start looking at me  And asking me why the F are you letting this guy write for this site  And then he wanted us to pretty much sell Sickboy down the river  We're not going to do that  We're not going to do that to anyone that helps out our radio show  Especially before we get all the facts and look into it  If you've been to the site  It is satire  It is politically incorrect satire and commentary 
[27:30]
 On wrestling and other stuff that goes on in the world  And on the top of that very post  The guy even wrote  The author even wrote  This is a mock, this is not real  This is not to be taken seriously by  Whoever's reading it  Was it distasteful?  Sure  You know something?  So what?  It was a little comedic thing that he threw together  And why can't you put racial stereotypes in comedy 
[28:00]
 And not be lambasted for it  If The Rock doesn't agree with it  Fine, he doesn't have to read it  But then what's he going to just disassociate himself  With anyone who's even read the site  Well  I didn't even read the site  That's what blows me away  He's attacking the wrong people  First of all  He walked off our show  It's interesting when you look at racial stereotypes  And some comics do get away with it  Some comics don't 
[28:30]
 The ones that do  That Apollo theater show  Let's make it clear  We stereotype on the show  Oh hell yeah  That's a part of comedy  It has been for many many years  So wasn't The Rock part of the nation of domination  Remember that?  I remember that  And the guy that is the godfather now was in there  And D-Lo  It was like a white hating black supremacist group 
[29:00]
 Why is it okay in that regard?  Yeah  I mean Rock was part of that  He got into a battle with DX  And they all got in blackface  Went into the ring  And started imitating the nation of domination  In blackface  And they were doing stereotypical black lingo  And walking and talking  The Rock was drawing a paycheck on that  So I guess that didn't upset him that much  The more I think about it  The more hypocritical this guy seems  Yeah with like 24 hours or so to mull this over 
[29:30]
 It's like you're a black man  It's leaving a bad taste in my mouth  Exactly  At the time you're stunned  You feel like you just got hit upside the head with a baseball bat  It's hard to think of all this stuff  And you know what  We don't want to sound like pussies today  I'm going to say it again  If the Rock wants to discuss this further we're here  I'll do it face to face  I don't care  It's a very smart thing to say  No it's the truth though  And he's still in the area 
[30:00]
 It's not like he had to fly anywhere else  He's doing another book signing somewhere today  I know where but I'm not going to give him any more publicity  Screw him  He's not a man  He didn't want to discuss this off mic  He's not going to go  Well look if you want the full story  Check out the little snippet I wrote on the foundermusic.com site  If we have time we're definitely going to replay the uncomfortable moment  If you do I'll call sick and try to make sure he's not listening 
[30:30]
 Honestly Rick was listening to it in the office  I couldn't even listen  He kind of made us look stupid  It's just uncomfortable  It's awkward silence  It's a lot of people going  Yeah well you're trying to get your thoughts together as the mics are on  And then you're blindsided like that  And then you quickly realize you can't say anything  This guy's not going to listen to anything  Right exactly 
[31:00]
 What were you going to do about it?  Nothing  Not a problem  Talk to you soon  Now pompous  How pompous too  Why don't we walk in here  He thinks people want to hear Dwayne Johnson  They want to hear The Rock  Dave  What's up Bowen A  I think I came to the conclusion why The Rock kind of flipped out on you guys  Well because I taped it for my friend 
[31:30]
 And I kind of went back to it and I listened to it  And you know when Sickboy asked that question  And The Rock said before I answered that  I got some questions about your website  And all you guys were like  Oh no kind of like saying like  Oh no he's in trouble now kind of thing  Well just because we  But we had no idea he was bringing up that  You know what because if I was The Rock I'd probably think to myself  Oh they'd probably know what's on the site because they're saying that  And he's probably thinking oh yeah these guys are in it too 
[32:00]
 It was more that we know Sickboy has an edge to him  That's all I was thinking when we had that reaction  Why I still think it's kind of dick on The Rock's side  Yeah  He's a hypocrite  Alright man  Ok man  You guys are great  Alright  Later  James what's going on  Hey open air  Jamie the bus driver  Listen man  I was dying to get in last night to call it was too late  And this has been on my mind just as it's been on yours 
[32:30]
 And I'm not even part of the show  First of all I want to say I'm not a racist  I have kids  But The Rock was way off number one  I mean he said no way of laying it into you guys  By any way shape or form is number one  Number two  This is not a political forum show  You know what I'm saying  It's a comedy show  And whatever stuff that's written on that page  Like you said he kind of stole my thunder about the satire  It's satire it's all as a joke  And it pissed me off to listen to him get all twisted 
[33:00]
 I bet you he laughed his ass off while Chris Rock was calling the Backstreet Boys crackers with attitude  Right  You know what I'm saying  Whenever he listened to Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy joke about Asian people  Or watching the Godfather do one of his skits  Yeah there you go  Come on let's face it  There's no way  He could have took that stance  He had other issues that dude  And by him taking it out on you guys  Was wrong  I got a little bone to pick though 
[33:30]
 It seemed like you guys did a little bit of backpedaling  You know I mean you should have stood  I thought maybe you should have stood a little bit more  You know dude we didn't read the site  We didn't know where we were on it  But it's a joke  I didn't  When you hear the tape again maybe later on if you have time  Is that we were just in complete shock  It was an ambush no doubt  It was definitely an ambush  Because we were really having a good time with it 
[34:00]
 Yeah I know I was enjoying it  I was on the road enjoying it  We were hoping he was going to be more of the Rock  Because honestly he has nothing to say as Dwayne Johnson  Yeah I agree  What the hell is he going to say as Dwayne Johnson  I agree  Guys I'm in defense of you all the way  You've got a great show, it's a funny show  And people listening from WWF  If you're listening in  It's a comedy show people, wake up  Thank you James  Hey guys how are you doing  Listen I've been listening to you guys since August of 1998 
[34:30]
 I love you  You're my favorite  But I also love The Rock  And yesterday really sucked  Smackdown by the way last night was excellent  The Rock I think that was the Rock's best performance ever  But you know what you guys rule over him  Didn't even watch last night  I had to I just had to see how it was  But I love you guys  Screw him, you don't need him  You guys rule 
[35:00]
 Thank you  We've got to take a quick break  One of the writers from XWrestling.com is on the line  Oh yeah I've seen this guys  All the writers are checking in  They're really pissed too  Alright stay there  Sometimes you feel like a nut  Sometimes you don't  You guys are going to burn in hell  OBS  WNEW  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  1027 WNEW  It's FU Friday 
[35:30]
 We do have lots of things to get to today so  Don't fret  Yes indeed  Starting with Lewis Black coming in around 4 o'clock Anthony  Very funny guy  Good friend of the show  He loves satire  He understands it  He's a cook  He's getting naked for Lewis Black and us  Yeah where does she come from?  I forgot  We'll get into it though  The same website I think Lou Besson or something like that 
[36:00]
 We'll get the plugs when they all get their asses in the studio  Let's go right back to the phones  If you have anything for the show  Jim you're next what's up?  Hey what's up guys  You know you got sold up the river this morning  On another morning show  What do you mean?  The Rock did an interview on T-Mension station  Yeah I don't care  On T-L-J  And they were asking him about what gets to him  Like what annoys him about people in society and his role and everything 
[36:30]
 And he pretty much had racial issues  And then had a big 5 minute dissertation on how yesterday he was forced to walk out of an interview  Before he did something he would have regretted  Ah he would have regretted  Yeah  Wow he was like ready to throw some punches  That's the way he made it sound  Ah great  We were sitting here at work and laughing at it because we knew what happened yesterday with you guys  And then hearing him this morning it's like  Talk about two face 
[37:00]
 Did Scott and Todd have the balls to mention our names because they do listen to us every day  Not at all  They didn't say anything but you could tell they knew who they were  Of course they knew  Everyone was listening to it yesterday  Bunch of pussies  He had to walk out  Yup before he did something he regretted  That's good  Now I can see where the rage problem is  Yeah really  They say he has a rage problem  Well that's obvious  It must be a treat 
[37:30]
 Thanks guys you're the best  Thanks Jim  Who's this  This is Rev Toby I'm a writer for X Wrestling.com  What's this I've seen some of your posts  First I want to thank you guys for supporting the site  And supporting Sickboy because I'm sure this has gotten you a lot of bad PR  That's okay we're used to that  And I mean it's just it's ridiculous  I think I read somewhere that this is in the first chapter of his book  He mentioned that he's all against racism and everything like that 
[38:00]
 I think this is kind of like a PR move  Oh you think  Well I mean it's like if he knew about this  He should have mentioned it before he came in the studio  Or when he was working it out to come in  Well if he would have looked at the post that he said he did look at  And he would have saw like it was a mock interview with Opie and Anthony  He could have yes asked us about it beforehand  Right I mean it's just that  I think he needed to get his little 50 minute plug in first 
[38:30]
 Exactly yeah and I mean like this gives him great PR for his book  Which by the way the critics hate  Because it wasn't written by him it was written by a ghostwriter  But that's another story  Yeah I mean  The Rock doesn't have time to write  Yeah I mean  I'm too busy freeing the world from racism  Also I mean you know like Sickboy gives us free  You know free enterprise to write  You know what we want  Well it's the internet  It's not regulated like that 
[39:00]
 You guys should have free enterprise  You know I may not agree with everything I read on the internet  But you guys should have the right to write whatever the hell you want  Write what you want man  Before they regulate that crap too  And you know something the Rock has a right to read it  Be offended and not want to speak to Sickboy  That's fine too  And we have the right to post whatever we want as well  This is written by a guy in California  Who I've never met  Who Sickboy's never met  And you know  The really strange thing was 
[39:30]
 A well while this whole thing was happening  He's like how's the interview going  And I'm like well  It just took a turn  And then he's like what happened  And I'm like well you know  The Rock got all pissed off  And he's like why  I'm like well  Because of your article dude  And Sickboy came back and he was actually contemplating closing the site  In fact this is still you know under debate  Right  Now that would be silly  Yeah I know I'm trying to 
[40:00]
 Consider that  And we've gotten tons of support email  Cool  It's all flowing in  So hopefully everything will be okay  And hey we got more hits yesterday than we ever got  I bet  No good publicity  Well thank you  Sure no problem  Dave what's going on  Hey Dave  Yeah what's up  Pretty good man  This is like the biggest story on the internet right now 
[40:30]
 That it's part of an angle that you guys took place in  So that's ridiculous man  Oh my god  That everyone should be skeptical that you guys are  That the WWF is trying to play off the John Rocker comments  And have the Rock do something like that  Well I  You know what  I have to say this  We had no idea this was going to happen  And you can believe that or not  But we had no clue  No freaking clue  And you mentioned John Rocker  Let me tell you something about John Rocker 
[41:00]
 I was kind of offended by everything he said  Okay  Or most of the stuff that he said  And it makes me want to take a D cell to his head next time he's at Che without a doubt  But you know what  He has the right to say those things  Yeah  People are so willing to give up their rights to free speech in this country  It amazes me  They go oh he should be fired  He has to go to a psychiatrist  Good  That guy's a nut  What's he saying 
[41:30]
 He's saying that some day some of them might not like what you're saying  They should go to a shrink  And you know I hate John Rocker  Hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him  But if I was him I would say I ain't  I'm not going to get that psychotic shrink  No I'm not going to a shrink  You don't want me pitching your leg  Oh well but I'm not going to a shrink  And John Rocker is actually an employee of Turner which owns WCW  So you know they're racist too so there you go  But just like  It comes to everyone's a bunch of hypocrites 
[42:00]
 Everybody  Hypocrisy all over this damn country of ours  I like everything being available to adults in this country  That's it  I'm saying like everything  It should be on the internet  The internet should not be regulated whatsoever  Anything should be able to be printed out  When they say oh you shouldn't have racial comments  This website's got to be shut down because it's against this group or that one  They shouldn't have plans for friggin' nuclear weapons 
[42:30]
 I don't care  Everything  If it's out there it should be available to everybody  Yeah that's why I even told Dickie shouldn't shut down the site  I told him we can't even get a slogan out of it  By saying X-Ras is willing to cite the Rocker Reads  You know just like maybe stick it to them  You guys should even put the posting back up  I swear to God just put it back up  Yeah exactly  Alright thanks a lot guys  I've seen funnier stuff from that site  It was kind of stupid 
[43:00]
 But you guys have the right to type that  I got to tell you  That McBeth man he's one funny son of a bitch  Yeah that guy who wrote the post  I was talking to him as well when it was going down  He didn't even care that he was getting in trouble  He was just making sure that you guys were alright  He didn't want anything bad to happen to you guys  This is on the trouble meter for the Opie and Anthony show  This doesn't even raise the yellow light yet  Nothing  Believe me we've been in much bigger trouble than this  Alright Dave 
[43:30]
 Thanks a lot guys  Dennis you're next what's going on  Hey guys I think you guys were being totally duped by the Rock  I think what he did was he knew his time was almost up for the interview  What better way to get him  To get people to still talk about him after he's gone  Create some controversy  And this is what he talked about with his publicist for two hours the night before  And that's why he dropped the bomb on you guys  Near the end of the interview  It was 8 minutes to 6 when he did it  Because I looked at the clock  Because I think the world stopped at that time once he blew that up 
[44:00]
 And I was thinking  You know what his publicist is really shrew because it's the perfect time to do it  Well you know if that's what they planned it worked  Brilliant, congratulations  Great job at our expense  Great job  Well you know what the good thing is  I think most of us listeners are more educated than the Rock himself  So we know better  Alright guys you guys are great keep it up  Alright  Not a man 
[44:30]
 Any man would have discussed it further after we went off the air  Rob what's up  I just got to say above all else  You know what the Rock did is just bad for business  I mean if there's anyone out there giving plunks to the WWF  And making them look good  You know you guys have the audience  You have the audience at the palm of your hand every day  We have given the biggest support in the New York market  I mean half the jocks on the radio have no clue about the WWF  I know and it's like  Now he goes and whatever it occurred 
[45:00]
 What are you going to say  You haven't just given people a chance to talk about it  You give the WWF segments on your show  You know  After today you watch out how many times we mention the WWF in the future  I know and what are those comments going to be  I mean you had nothing to praise in the beginning and now it's just  Nah there's plenty of other things to talk about  I mean if you're going to be a smart businessman  Above all else you got to  You know you got to look to the people that help you out  And that was his biggest mistake above all else  Was to make himself look bad in your eyes 
[45:30]
 That's all I got to say  Take care  Tom what's going on  Hey we're going to see the Rock right now at a book signing  Yeah  Yeah we're going to give him a little piece of our mind  You better watch out  You better watch out he has a rage problem  Yeah I don't know  I think I might have to give him the rock bottom myself  And he's in my home town  I was going to say is that  Is that that book still right by your house 
[46:00]
 Yeah the one by the Woodman Mall  No it's at the tower at the wall  Oh okay I thought it was like that little one  Right in the village there  Thanks now everyone knows exactly where I live  No one knows exactly where you live  They know you live in the Huntington Village area  We're alumni of Harborfields ourselves here  Alright alright  You Greaser Bastards  Call Rock a puss for us will ya  Yeah I think we're going to try to get a couple supporters to come with us  Bring some signs  Thank you Tom 
[46:30]
 Alright guys no problem  What an insult he's in our town today  Oh the Rock taking over your town there Opie  Hey Rock if you don't like Opie and Anthony  Well the whole town feels the same  So why don't you cancel your book signing  He doesn't have the balls to  Yeah I don't know we're going to see if he pulls up with an entourage or something  I'll probably go down there  You guys just show up down there we'll be there  We're hours away from there  Oh that's right 
[47:00]
 You know what we're all guilty of too  Me, you and Sickboy  We're all guilty of this  Getting so friggin shaken up  And trying to count every word that comes out of your mouth  When you're constructed  Confronted with a black guy  And us as white guys  When you're confronted by a black guy  Calling you  Or at least implying that you may have some relationship  With something that is racist  And we're all guilty of it  You see what we did 
[47:30]
 You try to make excuses  You know something  Never again  Whatever's on my mind I swear to Christ  It's going to come right out of my friggin mouth  I gotta say it again though  I was just in such shock  I was just in shock  I'm not going to lie to you guys  But I was just in shock  Where the hell is this coming from  Why does it involve me  I'll be honest with you  If it was an Irish guy sitting there  And he starts talking about some comments 
[48:00]
 That were on a website about drinking or something  Guaranteed one of us would have went  I'll have a beer and calm down  Ha ha ha  Big joke  But when a black guy confronts white guys  About racism  Like that  And everything's okay  You know something  I've had it  I'm speaking my mind  Thank you Welpy  Well you have one supporter in  Thank you 
[48:30]
 Thank you  I'm just bowing here  Let's take a Rick Scott sound  I mean I was the only one so far  That has listened to the tape again  And when you guys play it later  You're going to see  You didn't stammer as badly as you think  And there was still kind of a lighthearted thing going on  Lighthearted  Yeah believe it or not  You listen back to it  I was kind of surprised  I was like huh  When it happened it felt like it was going on 
[49:00]
 A whole lot worse than it actually did  So I think you guys really came out  I think you came out looking pretty good  It was intense  When I go home and I get that many people calling my house  No one calls my house  My own family doesn't even call me anymore  That's when I know it was a big deal  You know what though  I would love to see signs at the next televised event at the Garden man  God damn I would love to see that  Royal Rumbles at the Garden  They're playing the Continental Arena soon  I'd bring signs right to Rock's face today 
[49:30]
 When he's doing his big signing  I would just love to see some signs out there  Be creative  We got to take a break  We got to move on because this is going to get really old real fast  I mean we'll touch on it later with the tape and stuff  But we got to get Lewis Black in here  He's not here yet but he should be here any moment  Alright  Alright  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway  You're going to have to tune us in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next  We refuse to be responsible  We refuse to be responsible 
[50:00]
 We refuse to be responsible  1-0-2-7  W-N-E-W  Hey Anthony Stacker 2 the world's strongest fat bird  Yes our good friends at Stacker 2  Let's welcome them back to the Open Anthony show Anthony  For the new millennium  For the new millennium is right  Stacker 2 has been here since the beginning on the Open Anthony show  We appreciate that  Lots of our listeners have lost a lot of weight with Stacker 2  Stacker 2 the world's strongest fat burner  It burns the fat 
[50:30]
 It crushes the cravings in between meals  One more  And it gives you the boost of energy  That you need when you're lacking late in the day  Like we are  If you want to check it out for yourself  It's Stacker 2 the world's strongest fat burner  They have a website  Everyone has a website these days  www.stacker2.com  What do you think is on the Stacker 2 website?  Chicks  There are chicks on the site  I went there  Girls that have lost weight using Stacker 
[51:00]
 Alright Stacker 2 the world's strongest fat burner  Give them a call  1-800-LIGHTLINE  Stacker 2 the world's strongest fat burner  1-027-WNNW  It's the Open Anthony show  Hey man  And it's FU Friday  If you want to curse someone out today  The best way is through the fax line  212-957-9639  Right Anthony?  Absolutely  Still waiting for Lewis Black to make his entrance into the studio 
[51:30]
 Maybe after the last hour of radio he's staying away  I don't think he should  He better not  There's a check out there  What's the chick all about?  I thought Rick was in the studio  There he is  She's from Rouse.com  The site that has Luba's naked pics  They wanted to do us a solid  Because Luba wouldn't get naked in the studio  And send one girl down that wood  Alright  She's going to get naked for Lewis  Very good 
[52:00]
 Cool so we'll have to wait for Lewis to get here to do that right?  Alright  Rosie Perez involved in one of those meaningless arrests  I love when these celebrities get arrested  For their causes  In the past  Who else has been arrested in this town  I know Reverend Al every other week is getting arrested somewhere  But it's not a real arrest  Susan Sarandon  Is really into that  Bill Cosby  Likes doing that 
[52:30]
 Now Rosie  What was it for?  What was it for?  To stop nuclear testing in Puerto Rico?  Well honestly it's a big issue though  Is it?  Yeah the people of Puerto Rico are really pissed off  There's a small island off the coast or something  They're blowing up bombs  And we're doing nuclear testing  How do you feel about that Rick  Being a Puerto Rican gentleman  I don't really care  I could give a crap  It's a small island they've been doing it for years 
[53:00]
 We basically own them anyway right?  Well that's what they say  What are we blowing up?  Well we can't blow up bombs  I guess we're just testing some kind of nuclear stuff  Yeah  It's a pretty huge issue to the Puerto Rican community  Funny it's like a real small island  It's like okay no no it's on this side so it's okay  You know damn well it's probably affecting them  It's nice to see Rosie Perez actually can get arrested  In this town 
[53:30]
 More publicity than she's had in the last what?  I know  Seven years  She wasn't hanging with Puffy either  Alright listen I gotta cut you guys off because Joe Lyons just arrived with Lewis Black  Oh Lewis  He's a very busy and popular man  Oh he's not here yet  Was that just Joe?  Just Joe  What is Joe going to answer our show from Comedy Central  I don't know did he hear the Rock show  Like everyone else  Like everyone else  Alright what we have to do anyway is take another break because we spent so much time on the Rock 
[54:00]
 Wow we just took one  I know we're running late so what we'll do is we'll do the F lesson  Okay  Very popular bit on Friday and then we'll be back hopefully with Lewis Black  Stay there  Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word  F***  Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F 
[54:30]
 F*** is the only word that is referred to as the F word  It's the one magical word  Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love  F*** as most words in the English language is derived from German  The word flichen which means to strike  In English F*** falls into many grammatical categories  As a transitive verb for instance  John F*** Shirley  As an intransitive verb, Shirley F***s 
[55:00]
 Its meaning is not always sexual  It can be used as an adjective such as  John's doing all the F***ing work  As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too F***ing much  As an adverb enhancing an adjective  Shirley is F***ing beautiful  As a noun, I don't give a F***  As part of a word, abso-f***ing-lutely or in-f***ing-credible  And as almost every word in a sentence 
[55:30]
 F*** the F***ing F***ers  As you must realize there aren't too many words with a versatility of F***  As in these examples describing situations such as fraud  I got F***ed at the used car lot  Dismay, oh F*** it  Trouble, I guess I'm really F***ed now  Aggression, don't F*** with me buddy  Difficulty, I don't understand this F***ing question 
[56:00]
 Inquiry, who the F*** was that  Dissatisfaction, I don't like what the F*** is going on here  Incompetence, he's a F*** off  Dismissal, why don't you go outside and play hide and go F*** yourself  I'm sure you can think of many more examples  With all of these multi-purpose applications  How can anyone be offended when you use the word  We say, use this unique flexible word more often than your daily speech 
[56:30]
 It will identify the quality of your character immediately  Say it loudly and proudly  F*** you  Alright, it's Opie and Anthony, before we take a break  There's a great instant feedback coming up  Coming to our attention here  From AJ from Brooklyn  I gotta read this one  This is all such BS, I'm black and what happened yesterday  I've got no words  You're right Anthony, speak your freaking mind  This society is so F***ed up and sensitive it makes me sick 
[57:00]
 Blacks can talk about white folks but you guys can't joke back  I like the Rock, used to anyway  But if he's such a sensitive pussy, F*** the Rock  You guys rule  In blazing saddles, there were more n***er and engine jokes than anything  What did people take offense with  When Mongo dropped a horse with one punch  This society is F***ed up  Later you guys keep doing what you're doing  Yeah  Very good AJ  Opie, Anthony 
[57:30]
 You guys can conflict, piss me off, okay  1027 WNEW  1027 WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony  And look who's in the studio, Anthony  Ah, Lewis  Lewis Black from Comedy Central everyone  He's back  He remembers us  I remember you, I'll never forget you  You know, we played an old tape of you this week  I heard that 
[58:00]
 Because we don't really feel like working right at 2 o'clock  So we play some Bones  And we're like, yeah, Lewis is good for another spin  And it was all current stuff so I guess we don't even have to do this today  This is great  That's perfect  Where you been, what you been up to?  I've been trying to find a vein that works  You know, it's so difficult  After you eat these needles for so long  Who knew you were on the smack  It takes weeks  Have you used the ones in your penis yet?  Oh no  Then I guess you don't really have a problem 
[58:30]
 Hear those junkie stories  Where they have to start using those veins  Right, that's when you know you have the real problem  Well I was in, well first I was going to come by Christmas  But you guys took the week off  What sissy  Aw, come on now  That's so bogus  We're going to stop for a while  And spend some time  I didn't even do that  I got away so I didn't have to spend time with the family  Where'd you go?  I went skiing  I blew off the family this year 
[59:00]
 I did the family thing  Well you must have some family  You go back for the holidays  I'm Jewish so it's totally who cares  I'm going to go back for Christmas and look at a naked living room  Not a tree in sight  You didn't have that Hanukkah bush crap  Like Hanukkah which is just a chumpster time of year boy  And then they'll start calling it  No it's not, it's a wonderful holiday  This is very special for our children  They like getting socks three days in a row  It's a miserable holiday  So I don't really care 
[59:30]
 So I worked actually at Caroline's that week  Oh you did  Well apparently they think I can draw against the baby Jesus  You know  That's a tough gig  They're going to either kind of celebrate the birth of the son of God  Or go down and see that psychotic Jew boy  What are we going to do?  Well they didn't show up I'll tell you that  You might need a better agent  Come on  Actually it was a great audience  Because you get 70 or 80 people  And it's Christmas Eve 
[60:00]
 That's a bitter crowd  They're not a happy group of people  True  And New Year's Eve  Big millennium  I've got some thoughts on the millennium  The rage is not subsided  What they did  With Y2K?  With Eiffel Gips  I wanted to play the part of this guy  I think we should just pick a date as a nation  And have some fun  Just screw things up or something  No just get together as a group 
[60:30]
 What do they do?  They basically, don't go out  Don't move  All women who are going to give birth on that night  We're going to sew you up  It's been the same for years  We don't know what to do  It was incredible  Don't move  Giant ticks could invade at any second  What a bunch of crap  So the entire country stays home  To watch other people celebrate around the world  So I'm sitting here at 9 in the morning 
[61:00]
 Going, you know it's Afghanistan  And nothing has happened  And I'm going, they're partying  And Chicago's like  We're going to have some  Of the fun for us at home  But in Afghanistan  They can even rub two sticks together  They were having more fun than us  And there's no problems in Afghanistan  I guess we would have been okay  Nobody came out  We're the ones who can screw up  Seven year olds left alone in a closet  Do not have the paranoid vision  That we came up with 
[61:30]
 For New Year's Eve  We all had this apocalyptic vision  Planes out of the sky  Buildings blowing up  And I did this thing  It turned out to be true  I did this thing on the  When we had our Millennium special  On the Daily Show  One of the few things  That I really was pleased with  They did a thing about the fact  That it already occurred  What were they talking about  This is it 
[62:00]
 Hello  It occurred about three and a half years ago  You know  What's the big change going to be  The attention deficit disorder  Has attention deficit disorder  We were just so screwed up  We didn't even notice  We were embracing  It's going to be a wonderful day  I might like the Raw Sewage Channel  There would probably be a night  Where I would sit there  And go look at the way it flows  It's beautiful 
[62:30]
 I would watch the Raw Sewage Channel  Too funny  The whole concept of  Terrorists terrorizing  I remember that movie Chud  They thought Chud was going to invade Times Square  Carnivorous humanoid underground dwellers  That's very good  That's frightening that you remember that  Yes it is  I can't remember what happened Thursday  Well he hasn't used all his veins yet 
[63:00]
 That's why  I'm ejecting directly into the retina  They welded the manhole cover shut  And then you know what's really frightening  I mean hundreds  Of surveillance cameras in Times Square  For the millennium to thwart the terrorists  That were going to strike  They're not taking them down  They are not removing these things  This is new cameras  This camera is everywhere  You ever notice you can't be on the streets  Without being on some camera 
[63:30]
 Cameras in the stores  Cameras on the streets  By the lights  They ain't taking them down  Ant was the only New Yorker in Times Square  For the big celebration  I wasn't in Times Square  I was high above Times Square  I was in this building on the 35th floor  What a view  He crashed the party  I'm walking around  I went upstairs  There's a sign that says Party 2000  That's for me  I walked in 
[64:00]
 I was like hey how you doing  It was amazing  The best was your past though  I got to walk in the hall passes  Yeah because the security in Manhattan  The security was amazing  If you were in New York City  You could not walk block to block  Without a hall pass like in school  I got what the Parker Meridian  Had to hand me a pass  That I had to give to police officers  At roadblocks  Saying I just got to pee  I'll be right back 
[64:30]
 Let me raise my hand  That's unbelievable  I just don't understand why terrorists  Are terrorizing us  Our mayor terrorizes us  Why don't you need somebody to come in  You're going to be a terrorist  Terrorize a place where they're going to notice  If they blow a couple of buildings  It's a view  I wonder what they're going to build next  The buildings fall down on their own  A bunch of freaking  Whatever the hell that was  The guys that try to blow up the World Trade Center 
[65:00]
 A truckload of explosives in the basement  Boom  The thing shakes  If your windows break some smoke  It doesn't fall down  They move a crane wrong in Times Square  Chunks of building are taking out the elderly  You're right  Why bother with the terrorism  It just happens on its own around here  This is when I knew I truly made the transition  You know that thing about  You walk by the homeless 
[65:30]
 You don't see them  I was in a subway about 7 years ago  Going downtown from a club uptown  We stop at 14th Street and they announce  The doors open and go  Ladies and gentlemen, it's 14th Street  There's apparently a bomb on board this time  Could you please exit immediately  And nobody moved  Nobody moved  I didn't even get up  I just sat there and went, well yeah right 
[66:00]
 We've heard it before  If you're in New York you've heard it all  Show us  I'm not giving up my seat  I don't see it  It's not in my car  I've only got two stops to go  Let's give it a run  I'm moving to take a chance  Very good  It was so brutal that whole experience  I was a kid 
[66:30]
 I'm old enough so I looked  I'm going to be a born and raised  I'm going to have a lifetime  And they're constantly telling me  You're going to live to be in the year 2000  In 2000 when the movie came out  I didn't have enough drugs then  I think part of my brain is still left there  With him and the pod  But you kind of anticipate this  I just felt like  Once again I'm a sucker  I bought it and then they crushed me  I performed that night 
[67:00]
 28 people in Chicago showed up  28  That's a room of fun people  And they're thinking  God I think I made a terrible mistake  I said it would have been more fun  Running around the room  Lifting them in their wake  Which was the second show right?  It was the second show  It was extraordinary  I just couldn't  But here's Christmas Eve  About 8, 7, 6 years ago 
[67:30]
 I was in playing performing Get Again  Because it was when I was really up again  I thought OK sure I'll take on the baby Jesus  It was 3 people in the audience  Oh my God  And the guy made us perform  He was playing and he said  You're going to perform  Couldn't you just take him for a ride in your car  Exactly  Put him in the back seat  Exactly  It's exactly it  The first two comics went up and performed 
[68:00]
 I go up  I'm 8 minutes into the act  And one of the guys leaves the room  He walks  33%  I turn to the audience and I said  Aren't you glad that prick is gone  The audience, the couple  I said isn't this great  It's just us now  Thank God  He was bringing this room so down  That's awful  I sat at the table  I did table comedy 
[68:30]
 You might as well at that point  Why be on the stage  Why are you any better than them  And then I thought it was depressing for me  If you were a comic this club was heaven  It ran in Washington for a while  Downstairs was a strip club  Next floor with great food  They'd serve you the food  You'd get up for dinner  There's a little leery of the strip club  It's free so you go  The second floor was the sports bar  And then the comedians  I said if you had a bed here I'd never leave 
[69:00]
 Sure why not  I went downstairs  I had two for my show  Then I go downstairs  They had one person  It's Christmas Eve  There's decorations  Who goes to the strip joint on Christmas Eve  I thought there'd be some nice Jewish girls  Monica thing  I forgot about that  Now Sheila and the buff will light the candles  We feel like we were robbed for the millennium 
[69:30]
 As a kid I don't know one person that didn't sit there  And do the math and figure out how old you were going to be  The movies they showed you  2001 to space  They got a year to build that big wheel  And send a ship to Jupiter  One year  Where are our flying kids  2001  Where are our flying cars  Where are the jet packs we saw at the World's Fair  The robots for our houses  We're still driving internal combustion automobiles 
[70:00]
 Oh sure they look a little flimsy  And where do we get cell phones  We get the total detritus  So people can't drive the internal combustion cars  Because they're frigging on the cell phones  And they can't get enough information out of their cell phones  Look at those things  What?  And a TV, there's one with a TV  It's like Spock's tricorder now  For God's sake  You can see where the little beast is behind the rock 
[70:30]
 Exactly, on your cell phone  Unbelievable  But everywhere else we got rooked  I thought we'd be flying around in those Jetsons cars by now  Nothing, we got crap  And then they take away the fun  They take away the fun  Did you see that?  There was no drinking in Times Square  They were just mounted to cages  They caged them in between the blocks  Where they couldn't move for 9 or 10 hours  I don't, what, how much brain power do you have to be standing 
[71:00]
 Unlike one of those cross streets  You're packed in where you're not even seeing  You can't even see what's going on  You can't even see, at least to me  If you're New Orleans and you've got a drink in your hand  Sure  And people were packed in there at 7  What did they do from 7 to 12  If I went through my life  I would have to go through my life a billion times  I would have to make stuff up  I'd have to pretend things  And now you're talking to people 
[71:30]
 And you're not sitting down  It's freezing  No booze  And you know how interesting people are when you're not drunk  When you're not drunk for 5 straight hours  For 5 hours, someone you don't know  Well, we're convinced Katie got her booze though  Katie Couric looked a little, the news  The news just went crazy  See, I missed it  All the coverage was astounding  Tom Brokaw, I miss me a million years  Just seeing him try to say the word millennium  Had me dying  And Katie Couric 
[72:00]
 I don't know if she's a lady that likes to drink  In my professional drinking opinion  The woman was smashed  She's on Times Square  She's on Times Square  Literally on Times Square, laying down  I mean, at one point she looked, that's not it  And she was so depressed that nothing was going on  With the Y2K  Yeah, all the news people freaked out  Nothing happened  Nothing happened  The pigs  In 1201 people are huddled around their dishwashers  Weeping with joy 
[72:30]
 Look, it started again  It's going to work  It's going to work  And then you get these  I don't even know what I was going to say  I haven't thought  I thought I'd get back one thought with another  I thought, my God  It was a good thought  I think we need to take a break  Are you performing?  I know you're performing here  But someone's on the line  Where's Lewis Black performing next?  At the Gotham Comedy Club tonight at 8.30 and 11 
[73:00]
 And then the next  Tomorrow night at 8.30 and 11  Yeah, there's a 22nd between 5th and 6th  Cool  Lewis loves talking about current events  If you've got something, give us a call  1027571027  Opie, Opie, Opie, Anthony  1027WNEW 
[73:30]
 1027WNEW  It's Opie and Anthony  And Lewis Black from Comedy Central  In the studio from The Daily Show  I tell him to hold that thought  Because we were having a little conversation  During the commercials  I had five others  And you never know  Who's going to check in on the radio show, Anthony  Our buddy, our pal  Not that Lewis isn't our pal, Anthony  Of course he is as well  Jay Moore live from Hollywood  Checking in today  Jay, Jay 
[74:00]
 I want to talk to the half-breed  Oh my God  Who are you talking about?  The half-breed  I don't want half-breed  I'm talking to Mr. Mowen Face  I had a little tension there  How the hell did you find out  Out there in Hollywood?  You guys are blowing up  You guys have no idea  How big you guys are blowing up  I get status reports  From my little moles  I got planted throughout the city 
[74:30]
 I told Mike DeNicola  I told him about the gay phone sex with Marco  He didn't believe me  He started listening when you guys replayed it  On the worst of  And now he's listening every day  Now he's listening to it all  Now Boston has heard that  Really?  Yeah, they're starting to play our bits up in Boston  We sent that one off  They loved it  I'm telling you, you guys are blowing up  You're a phenomenon  We almost blew up yesterday 
[75:00]
 The Rock versus Sickboy is not exactly a fair fight  Me and Rick, that could last about a minute  We were hoping to have your wrestling skills  In the studio yesterday  We needed something  I don't think the Rock is going to like you, Jay  I can't really think of anything funny  Because I'm unemployed  My wife and I slept until 12.30  She goes, what's wrong with us?  I go, we're unemployed  That's exactly what you're supposed to be doing  Anything in the works there, Jack?  Yeah, a lot of things in the works 
[75:30]
 That's the problem with Hollywood  You've got 17 things in the works  About a month goes by and you realize  One of them came to freaking tuition  I thought I was right on the cusp of 17 projects  Turns out I'm a dick  I'm going to give that part to the lead singer of Sugar Ray  Yeah, he's got acting chops  I understand that  God damn  Charlie's Angel  I went in for Charlie's Angels  I'm taking a piss after the audition  I just went in and met them 
[76:00]
 The guy goes, let's play Lucy Lou's boyfriend  And the director in the room  In front of everybody is like, oh, it's going to be great  What do you think, Lucy Lou, huh?  I go, yeah, whatever  I just want to be in the movie  I go to the bathroom  It was a funny script  It was like James Bond  It was really crazy  Anyway, I'm in the bathroom taking a leak  And the guy comes in right behind me  And he's like, so what do we got to do to make this happen?  I'm taking a leak 
[76:30]
 I'm like, what do you mean?  And so we're just standing there peeing  And I'm like, no, hey man  I just want to be in the film  I think it's really funny  And he's like, we've got to make it happen  This is great  And then he leaves  I didn't hear anything  They gave it to Sugar Ray  What happened to peeing side by side?  Touching elbows  Sugar Ray  At least he didn't give it to a half breed 
[77:00]
 It's John Rocker when you need him  Yeah, if we had John Rocker in here  John Rocker would have fought him  John Rocker would have fought him  All of a sudden a professional wrestler is becoming very political  You know what we could have done?  We could have gone, we, like I'm sitting right next to you guys  That's the love of the O.B. and Anthony  That's the love of the show  I'm 3000 miles away and I just said, we  See, exactly  We got so many emails that said  Jay should have been there to smooth things over 
[77:30]
 I would have punched him right in the half breed  You think I'm going to lose a fight to a half breed?  I've got a half breed  They're not smart  They lack the necessary intelligent tools  That's why they're not in the front office  You're going to be on Extra tonight, man  I'm going to be on Nightline  Jay Moore's racist remarks about The Rock  Hey, we should have picked him up with Jasmine St. Clair  That twat  God damn  Oh man, what a great couple they could be  The Rock and the Whore 
[78:00]
 The Rock and the Whore  She pissed me off that day  She pissed me off and I'm like  More into porno than all your comp-  Well, not Anthony  Anthony watches so much porno  He watched, he rented one and didn't rewind it all the way  And when he hit play he recognized the guy by his balls  That's when you know you watch too much porno  He's Louis Black in there  I love Louis Black  Well, let's not get that  I can't believe he's screaming like this 
[78:30]
 I'm going to walk out of the studio  And I'm the one who's going to get shot  We're the only ones that chain it all  Louis Black, crowy black hair, glasses, color in a nice suit  You can catch him right at the Brooklyn Diner  Get him  Louis, I got a lot of weight in the tri-state area, my friend  Oh yeah  Where are you at? Are you in town?  Yeah, I'm at Gotham tonight  Oh, New York, O.C. Louis Black  One of Jay Moore's favorite comics  I just spoke up about myself in the third person  Just like The Rock 
[79:00]
 Yeah, that's what time in LA does to you  He's not that intelligent because he's a ham-breed  Why did he pick a name like The Rock?  It's easy to remember  Don't ask me, The Rock, Louis, you know that girl that did the 300 guy gangbang?  Yeah  And she was so mean  She's a miserable bitch  What's up next for you? Why do you care?  I mean, there's a worse for her  It's the shittiest bitch 
[79:30]
 I think the game would have to be a C  Or K if you do it, it's the comedy K-word  Yeah, if you're The Rock you're turning into a K  You're a ham-breed  Hey Jay, when are you coming back to New York?  Everywhere, I'm doing Rascals and Caroline  I want to take attention away from the fact that  Louis Black, one of my favorite comics, is at Gotham tonight  Hey, fly us out so we can do a live Opie and Anthony show from your crib  I'll fly you guys out 
[80:00]
 He's unemployed, man, come on  I'm doing a gig down here, I've got a tour deal down here  Jay, the show was good  Thanks, pal  Yeah, I think everyone liked it  You know when they dropped the ball in Times Square for the Millennium?  Yeah  If the show was still on the air, Fox would have put it on opposite that  I love Louis Black, big Louis Black fan  Hey, before we let you go, what's your opinion on the whole Bill Parcell thing, man?  Everyone talking about the jet situation 
[80:30]
 Well, I think Belichick's kind of a fag  He's not a very good head coach anyway  He's a great defensive mind  He's gone, man  But he's never been a great defensive player  He's always been a great defensive player  Well, he's gone, man  But he's never been a great head coach  No  And the excuses he used were so pathetic  The fact that he compared the Browns moving in the dead of night to Baltimore 
[81:00]
 And changing coaches and stadiums  Comparing Matt to Wayne on head dying  Comparing the two situations as the craziness when owners die or move  It's just so ludicrous  And the fact that he accepted a two-year extension on his contract  So no other team could talk to him  If he goes to the Patriots, they'll be in litigation for a very long time  I think we should get Ditka  You think? Ditka?  No, I was getting scared there for a second 
[81:30]
 You know what I'm hoping is that Parcells is up in the front office  And they do like a coach hunt  And nothing's really working out  And then Parcells just goes, you know what?  Give me the reins  I'm going  You want the reins? I'm sick of it  Give me the reins, Norton, I'm going in  I'm saving the team  Norton, Vinnie Black  Norton, my friend, I'm coaching the Jets  Louis Black, is that cop from Norton?  We gotta go  Don't be too sure, Ralph, I ain't got no hairpin 
[82:00]
 I got a kern  A kern  Look at yourself  Alright, J  I'll fly you out code  You might have to sit in the same seat  Louis Black, one of the best comics going  You better get your ass in the studio  You better get in here  Sit in the hall and watch them half-breed  Jetson St. Clair and the Rock  Did you take this half-breed to be sloppy 370 seconds 
[82:30]
 See you later, guys, I love you  John Rocker, everyone  John Rocker  There he goes  That was funny  The guy's out of his mind  What a life he's living  Jesus Christ  That's a good script, Charlie's Angels  That's when you know they've lost their minds  It's kind of a combination of Austin Powers and Tweety Pies  Screwed the cap  Okay, great 
[83:00]
 I got you out there and you're going  Okay, what do we got, anything?  Wait a sec  So you want me to host a Tupperware party?  What's the price? $200,000? Fine  Be me, it'll be, yeah, and then what's your name?  Florence Henderson  An hour special  Couple of Christmas songs, then we do the Tupperware  They're coming in colors  I said that place when he started to talk  The thing about going in there  You have 17 projects 
[83:30]
 It's literally fake meetings, fake lunches  Fake projects  The only thing that's real is  You start to doubt it, it's the food  You're like, oh, we're going to be talking  I went to three meetings out there  They were completely clinically insane  And you kind of sit there  And you've got to keep your mouth shut  And literally part of the reason my career  Kind of has taken forever to even move an inch  Is that I go to these things initially  You know, about 15 years ago  And I'm going, are you insane?  You can't say that 
[84:00]
 They take it personally  And then they go  I was sitting with somebody  I mean, I must have been 35 at this point  But I'm sitting with a person  And the person was talking about something  I look at him, how old are you?  It's just when I'm 23  I said, well, why am I listening to you?  I said, I'm leaving  I'm leaving  We know that  Like you've been in those meetings where  You sit down, the first minute  You realize, oh my God, this is a complete waste of time 
[84:30]
 And now you've just got to sit and phase out  And hours go by  And they're just feeding you lines of crap  Yeah, you know  But in our case, we believed them  And that's why we're here  What the hell were we thinking that day?  And then before you know it  You're doing afternoon drive at any W  Jesus Christ, what happened?  And they're going, would you like more tea?  That's the high point of the meeting 
[85:00]
 We're going to have dessert  You're thinking dessert  The lunch was really good  That they gave us that  That was it  But out there, they come up, you ask for a tea  And then they bring you something that tastes like peach  And that's bull  I asked for tea, but it's our peach infusion  You know, stop it already  You guys have way too much time on your hands out here  That's California  What a slime bucket hole  It just gets worse and worse  I stayed at a hotel out there 
[85:30]
 And it was so hip  I was like, I'm going to get a headache the moment you walk in  You know, there's some of those  There's a Mondrian  I didn't stay there, but have you ever been in that one?  I stayed there actually  It looks like the  Sunset Boulevard  They dress them up like they're communist Chinese  The revolution is over, jackass  Mao is dead  Put on some clothes  They put Opie over there  And they put me at the high end across the street  Like, great, he stays at this opera crockery 
[86:00]
 I like my hotel better  The Hyatt is a great place  There's a poster  In hotels  The Hyatt is so bad  The light is so psychotic  And everything is so  That's good, an orange pillar in the middle of the room for no apparent reason  They're making a statement  If you're going with a girl, you'll find something to do with that orange pillar  Lewis, speaking of the Hyatt  Do you know the story of the comedian that jumped from the roof?  No  How does that story go? 
[86:30]
 How does the guy that was at the comedy store  Over there  Bombed  And then went to the top of the Hyatt  On Sunset  And jumped off  And hit the driveway that goes up between the comedy store and the Hyatt  He was trying to land in front of the comedy store  He wanted to really make it  You never heard that story?  He bombed and jumped off the roof  A comedian after a set  And now supposedly he's haunting the comedy store also  Like everyone else  Plenty of ghosts in the comedy store 
[87:00]
 Man, what an idea  There's somebody  That's perfect  But for the grace of God  Are we allowed to bring a naked woman in here for you today?  Sure, why not  We've got to get one  But what happened?  There's no lesbian thing, right?  My friends are going to be really disappointed  I know  We didn't have another girl  This girl is supposedly really cool  Does she need music to get naked or anything?  No 
[87:30]
 You know, what is the concept?  What is the deal behind this?  I mean, I know I hear these things go on here every time  Usually it's the day after I come on  You came in Friday  But on Monday, Pepe La Conca was here  You know, the conga player  And we had three goats  And then two women came in  And did some stuff that was absolutely spectacular  You have missed it all  How do you get them?  You mean they're just kind of flying  You're like, no, let's go uptown  Yeah, we just show up 
[88:00]
 In this case we plugged some website  We didn't even know we were plugging it  And all of a sudden the guy wants to give us a little thank you  A little how you doing  Another gift from the World Wide Web  So you perform in front of three people on Christmas Eve  And we're looking at gifts  That is unbelievable  If you want to talk to Louis  A bunch of people want to talk to you as well  212-757-1027  I can't even believe these ones  He's a disgusting little man  What a bitch  Train wreck radio 
[88:30]
 Bang over  This is sicker than faces of death  127-WNEW  All right, Anthony Paizano of Mulberry Street  Yes, you said you were going there the other day, did you?  I was going to go yesterday after the rock thing  And Joey was here  He brought a bunch of food for the rock and his people and stuff  And after that whole mess yesterday  I had no desire to go down there  And Joey didn't even want me to go down there  We all just went home depressed

 I'm kidding, of course, my God  You sure?  No  But who cares how he got the old world recipes  They're really good  Was I the only one hoping that Joey was going to pull out his piece yesterday when the rock was acting up?  Oh my God, did you see the news now?  Joey Paizano shoots the rock of the WWF  No  Can we just do a spot for Joey here?  He's a good friend of the show  We love Paizano, we're down there all the time  At least I am  And I know Rick is 
[90:00]
 Opie can't be bothered  That is not true  I patched it up for Joey  Going south of Times Square is a little rough for Opie  For some reason  Are you afraid to go near the village and think someone's going to recognize you?  What a cheap shot  Okay  You want to get into some stuff?  No  Oh, good, this is great  And Lewis came in and witnessed the breakdown  You were going to have a stripper on  But instead you decided to have a nervous meltdown breakdown

[92:30]
 Good  Listen, I want to know one thing  First of all, I think you're great, Lewis  Thank you  But what do you think about that picture from the Braves?  It's a jackass to the 50th power  Unbelievable, right?  No, it's perfect, it's just perfect  And I had to watch the Mets play Atlanta in Atlanta  And I said, you know, I said the guy  First off, when you bear a child that looks like Scooby Doo  You know there's going to be a problem  That guy's a mutt  It's unbelievable 
[93:00]
 But also listen, I want to know if I can send out an FU  And it's someone that you personally know will be, I'm sure  Your little Jesus freak from Huntington  With that eight foot cross on the back of the truck  What is up with that?  I've yelled at that guy a bunch of times  I'm hanging out with a cigarette at the cigar shop  This guy has like, Jesus saved  You've got to see the display this guy has  In Huntington, I mean he has totally made the commitment to Christ  What is his story? 
[93:30]
 I don't know, I want to get him on the show or something  Let me tell you something  He takes up all the great parking spaces on Main Street in Huntington  With a big truck  It's a truck, it has a trailer, it has like an eight foot cross  Big cross  And we've got to find out that the Holocaust is coming  The Holocaust is coming  It's because of the Clintons  But unbelievable  Actually it's the Holocaust is coming  It's a TV series  It's a continuous, that's what he's advertising  With Charlie's Angels 
[94:00]
 It's brilliant marketing by the WB actually  You're not a freak  You know what I've realized?  The more into being a Jesus freak you are  It only means the more of a sexual alcoholic deviant you were a few years before  The more you are into it  And preaching and putting crosses on your car  This guy must have been screwing girls at the elementary school  While down in Jack Daniels  Like 24 hours a day  You've got to get to the point where you've got to feel  You've got to drive around with a crucifix 
[94:30]
 An eight foot crucifix  Are you actually standing?  Yes  No, it's standing  When you get to that point, man, you're trying to make reparations  That's a great point because there's a new women's group out there  It's Born Again Virgins  How bad were those women that they have for  Slept bags  There's a new group called Born Again Virgins  And it's a women's group  No girl with ordinary sexual activity feels  I better become a virgin 
[95:00]
 When you've had more in and outs than the Lincoln Tunnel  Then you start thinking maybe I can join a group where it will grow back  You know who brings you your new hymen?  The Easter Bunny  Yeah, because it's true  It can happen  You could be a virgin again  Get out of here  There's no chance  It doesn't happen twice  You lost it once  Anthony, what's up? 
[95:30]
 What's up guys? How are you doing?  We have Lewis Black in the studio today  Lewis Black, you're incredible  I watch your daily show as much as I can  Thank you  I know that they're sending back  How do you feel about that?  I think we should get something for him  At least a box of cigars  A couple of pictures  I was going to say a couple of draft pictures  The Mets could use a couple of left-handers  Exactly  You don't give them up for nothing  We call them Raph Boy 
[96:00]
 And this poor sap, is he going to grow up to be a bitter man this kid  After seeing America and all the Christmas gifts from all over the country that he was in?  He was in America  A sympathetic little kid that got a lot of sympathy there during Christmas  Toys  Now he's going to come back to Cuba and live the rest of his life  Wait, what happened?  Wait, last year I remember around this time I got a hell of a lot of cool stuff  That's when you go into  That's when you start reading about  You pick up a paper 11 years from now  And you read about a transvestite hooker  And you're well 
[96:30]
 Formerly Raph Boy  Now Raph Chick  Yeah  Wow  Do you have any thoughts on that hijacking?  The puke plane as we like to call it  Oh man  That'd be rough  I'm really glad that the other countries, India has like  India they hijack a plane about every 8 minutes apparently  It's like how come this is the first one we heard of  Oh boy this happens all the time, all the time, all the time  We don't worry, we don't worry 
[97:00]
 And no one really cared  Nobody cared at all  I mean, whenever there's a hijacking  I usually can turn on CNN  And you'll see footage from the tarmac  You'll see the real telephoto view of the whole thing  Nothing  We barely got an artist rendering in the paper  The Indians don't negotiate  So there's nothing to talk about  You know what I mean?  It's not like we're asking for this and we're going to do that  There was no other side  You know, it's kind of, okay bye  And they said bye to the hijackers  Didn't they get away? 
[97:30]
 Yeah  They got some stuff  They walked off the plane, they killed a guy  They killed one of the passengers  Greg, you're next  Hey, how's it going, guys  Lewis, what is on the back of your mind about this 54 year old woman having trouble with  Yeah, that hit the paper today  I missed that  There's a lady wearing Connecticut, right?  Yeah, I think it's somewhere around here  That is impossible  That's got to be some sort of a circus hat thing 
[98:00]
 She's 36 in makeup  You can't be 64  54 having triplets  54, that's insane  Poor kid  Coming out must have been like going down one of those slip and slides without the water on  Come on  Oh my goodness  Man  I'm coughing up the lung  Wow  That's good  I mean you give them those fertility pills so that doesn't really happen 
[98:30]
 Those kids are all going to be waddy headed cephalic  They're going to have to be propped up somehow  Because you can't, if you had one of them you'd be lucky if the kid could walk  What are these three going to be?  Well let's see, let's divide the IQ into thirds  We got a 19 IQ so we got a 6, a 6 and a 7  You know, God in heaven, why are people faking?  Why are people faking?  I'm not too comfortable when mom has to go to the parent teacher conference and she's 102 
[99:00]
 You know?  Jesus man  Have some sympathy for the kid  That's like Tony Randall  Mr. Father of the Year, he's like almost 80 years old and he's having another infant  Geez man  Did she have other kids?  I don't know, I just saw the headline, I'm like I'm not going to bother with this one  I bet I would have to dance  You know, to probe a little deeper into the story  She probably has like a 35 year old kid  Yeah really 
[99:30]
 Take care of your brother  If David's brother needs a change in...  Geez man  Where did that take place, in the south?  Connecticut  Well you've ever been in the woods in Connecticut?  It's just, it is, it's a little scarier  It's a little scarier  Her biological sundial running out  What else is in the news?  The Clinton's did a one-nighter I guess 
[100:00]
 Yeah like he's going to spend two nights in a row in Westchester  That must have been a nice little evening  Because it was him, Hillary and his mother-in-law  You know that must be comfortable when he bumps into her in the robe, you know?  Oh yeah, it's the guy that got his swanky wax  We saw things that we haven't seen in 18 years  Yeah like there's probably a schmunster  You know he was locked in there, there wasn't a lot, you know how many rooms he's stuck 
[100:30]
 You know and she comes, you know this has got to stop, somebody has got to pull her aside  Did you watch, have you watched her, or maybe I'm just losing my grip  But I was watching her yesterday in that interview and she's talking, she's standing, she is completely detached  It's like somebody is funneling a voice through her at this point  She has absolutely no, there's no, there's no meshing of her emotion and who she is, there's nothing  It's ridiculous  She is, isn't it? It's like a Stepford wife  I would be a good senator, I would be good for all of us 
[101:00]
 And then she kind of does that creepy smile  And she's got nothing to back it up  Like anything, she doesn't have really any plan or anything  She just says, you know, vote me in, be good  That's it, but those guys have heard of her  And then they're going to give him 10 million bucks  Did you read that one? Yeah, a job on Wall Street, right?  A job on Wall Street, because you know he's so smart  He's so damn smart  Out of that, he's you know, he parlayed that into a 10 million dollar, it is not right 
[101:30]
 Oh you know, that's just safe, you look at, the man did that well in office, guess what?  He's an idiot, okay?  Okay, you know, let him near money, let him wave at people, let him touch behind  A job on Wall Street? Yeah, oh yeah  So how do you think he'll get into work?  The subway? Oh yeah, the subway, they'll chop her in  Yeah, I'm sure  What did you think of Donald Trump running to be the...  Oh, what a joke, I can't believe they're reporting this as a real story 
[102:00]
 Are there no adults left in the room? Right  Isn't there somebody, you know, like in the late 70s, a little class, a little Whit, a little Lewis  Take him into a small room, Donald, come here, guess what?  No, no, no talk, no talk, no  Hey, that's it, no  He's got all his yes men, I would love to see him get in just so you could hear the press go up  And here's Donald Trump taking his wife to the seventh grade 
[102:30]
 First first lady ever that's still in junior high  You see his little chippy? Yeah  Looks like one of his daughter's model friends  Yeah, it's amazing  And then when I actually heard he was running, my teeth tried to reach around to eat my brain  That was my first reaction  What a... guy thinks he's a self-made man, what a horse  His father's like one of the richest men ever, built all of these buildings in New York  Donald Trump's father could have chosen not to have children and had a chimp that just crapped its cage for 40 years 
[103:00]
 And that chimp would be worth as much as Donald is today, okay?  I'd turn the vote for the chimp  Are you kidding me? I want a chimp as president  I want Scooter and I think he'd be great and then you'd actually and then you go you turn on and we'd have like in the White House  You just turn it on and he'd be running around  That's the hysterical monkey chimp  That's an out of control chimp running around the Oval Office  Really? With a couple of trainers who chase him  And then you'd be like in the Union of Dresden just crapping and spanking one out on the desk 
[103:30]
 It'd be perfect  I thought we were talking about the monkey  Mark, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to ask Lewis, well first of all I wanted to say Lewis, I think you're great at Comedy Central  Yes, thanks  I wonder what your opinion was of NASA's repeated success with surveying Mars  I love it, it's my favorite stuff  I love it, it's my favorite stuff  Because eventually we're going to find out where it went and that'll be like, well I won't but you know our children's children 
[104:00]
 Will discover where it is  It'll just be a huge pile of crap on Mars  I want them to keep shooting stuff up there, you know, because eventually we're going to find, I like the idea of space travel  I was born and raised in the suburbs, what does that prepare you for? Space travel  Okay, after you live there, after you live in a place that has no real place, it's not a place, the suburbs  The only place is Mars  Or any other place, any other kind of a lonely planet, but I'm looking forward to it 
[104:30]
 I can't believe they can't get another, you know, remember how excited we all were with that first little Tonka toy thing  Driving around on Mars, you know, they can't do it again  That just shows you what a fluke that first one was  If it was real at all  Also, yeah, the idea like that they're going to, you know, when they were saying they're going to send somebody up in a certain amount of time  It's really bad, can you imagine?  They can't get a piece of hardware up there  You know, they're going to send a guy, you know, where are you? Venus, you idiot  I've always loved NASA though, I always loved that crap 
[105:00]
 Because at least it's kind of directed towards something other than, you know, hurting us  And let me say peace and love to you all  I have lost my mind  I can't believe I just said that  That's worse than swearing  We're trying to get the naked girl in, but we're having too much fun here  David, real fast, what do you have for Lewis Black?  Well, from what I hear, some of the Jenny Craig franchisees want to boycott the Lewinsky ads 
[105:30]
 Well, they should  Well, they absolutely should  Well, the way I see it, she's a fat chick, she's losing weight, it works  Well, we haven't seen her ass yet, I'm pissed  She was on Larry King for all that time the other night, you didn't stand up to let us check out that ass  That's true, I think they're paying her to lose weight  A million bucks  No, no, no, 10,000 a pound  10,000 a pound?  I won't eat any of that, you'll pay me 10,000 a pound, I won't eat  Yeah, exactly, 10,000 a pound, you'll pay me that and I'll learn how to blow myself 
[106:00]
 Good dad, good dad  Alright guys, love the show  Alright, bye  She should have that shake in the morning, shake in the afternoon and eat an unsensible president for dinner  That would be her little slug line  Alright, oh man  I think Lewis performed enough for us today, now we can give him his reward  Yes, a little payback  Alright, this girl's from Rooz.com, Rick  You don't sound like one of those strip club DJs 
[106:30]
 Now making a way to the Open Athlety Show live from Miami, Florida  You might recognize her as one of the Miami Dolphin cheerleaders  Wow, yeah, very nice  It's Rouse.com, R-O-U-Z-E.com  And Christie's in the studio  Hey, who's the dude?  Who is the dude? Are you the guy that runs the site?  I'm an editor at the site  Ah, well you always get a little nervous when a guy walks in 
[107:00]
 You don't have any racist comments on your website, do you?  About the Rock?  I don't say anything bad about the Rock  Because if you have racist comments on your website, we're going to have to tell you to go home  Or you might piss off Lewis  Lewis is going to leave  Oh wait a minute, your website, I've seen it there and you have nothing written about Lewis Black, I'm leaving  I'm going to start crying  So without boring the audience, what's Rouse.com all about?  Basically the first online destination site for men  Which basically we're kind of like Maxim in our content 
[107:30]
 But we have free email, we have stock quotes, we have Naked Girls  We have one each week, which is our strongest selling point  And we can't believe Luba did not take it off for you guys  Yeah, Luba was on this show, this girl, she was all sweet and innocent right off the boat from Russia, right Lewis?  We didn't even get a nip at her, right?  No  What's the problem, she came in a very shy day and all that, real shy? 
[108:00]
 A bunch of our listeners email us  Dude, you've got to check out the naked pictures of Luba  This website had just tons of pictures  So she didn't want to get naked for us, but she's naked for the whole world out there on the internet  And what is it, Rouse?  Rouse  R-O-R-O-U-Z-E.COM  Well Christy, want to get naked for Lewis Black?  Sure, why not 
[108:30]
 Alright  This is right now  She actually said  This is psychotic  We'll tape it and put it on the unofficial website  That would be good, my mother would be thrilled  All of a sudden my mother would go on the web for the first time ever  Alright, make sure Lewis isn't in the shot  Yeah, my mother finally got like web TV for Christmas  I'll never turn up into anything, this is it, this is where the court case comes  Oh yeah, Lewis' career was doing really well, he was on the OPA show, and the next thing you know he's playing Bayonne 
[109:00]
 And he's going to be, he's majoring in paisanos  He's going to be playing Paisanos  My brother thought it was sensible to get my mom web TV for Christmas  So she could enter the wonderful world of the internet  You know what the hell, the problem is there  She's going to be punching this show's website up, the unofficial one  And seeing what really goes on in here  I know, you're a trouble  She thinks I'm like Edward R. Murrow or something, you know  She thinks I'm a responsible journalist 
[109:30]
 Yeah, because before the internet we could tell our girls and our parents and stuff that  Oh, that was all fake on the internet  Oh, here's this picture of us  What's that on your face?  Oh, it looks like a woman, but it's a new type of hat  A nose warmer  Alright, Chrissy, a nose warmer, there you go  Do I get music?  You did want music?  Sure  Oh, we need the kaboom box  Yeah, we'll take a quick, can you stay for a couple more minutes? 
[110:00]
 Are you like, I got a life?  You're not leaving?  We could tease this for two hours and you would stay  It'd be fine  Louis is missing his gig tonight at Gotham  He's playing  Louis is still anticipating  Gotham tonight at 8 o'clock  Where's that located again?  It's 22nd between 5th and 6th  Louis Black in the studio, we'll be right back  O.B. and Anthony  This is debauchery mania  Prostate exams for everyone 
[110:30]
 1027 WNEW  1027 WNEW  It's O.B. and Anthony  I guess we gotta say goodbye to Louis Black so Chrissy could get naked for us  Oh, poor guy, come on  I thought we were moving on with a new segment here, no?  He ain't leaving  Alright Louis, see you later, thanks  It's been terrific  Bye everybody  Usually he can't wait to get out of here  He's looking at the clock the whole time he's on with us usually  I never look at the clock  I usually have a cup of that coffee and I think here we go for another 6 hours 
[111:00]
 Alright, we got Chrissy from Rouse.com in the studio  And she has been kind enough to do a little dance for us, Anthony  Yes, especially for Louis Black  Dance this spring I call it  Dance this spring  And I guess she wants to dance to Welcome to the Jungle  That's right  Alright, that works  Alright, let's get right into it then  What do you want me?  On Louis' lap  I would find it extremely difficult for me, notice me  Actually anywhere in there if you feel 
[111:30]
 She can do her thing  Wherever you need me  Should we bring a nice comfy chair in for Louis?  A lounge chair  You know this is psychotic  This is radio  This is music  This is music  This is music  This is music  What are you people listening to?  Now we're going to play something while Louis 
[112:00]
 A comic you've never seen  Sees a woman get naked  That's unbelievable  What has happened to this media?  Isn't it ridiculous?  It's insane  And people are driving along, oh good  And do you know something?  There are channels upon channel on your TV  If you get satellite TV  That only play music on your TV  And we're doing a live nude girl show here on radio  See how twisted we've become in the 21st century?  And after that we're going to do a Gilligan's Island rerun 
[112:30]
 Alright Louis has got a nice little chair  They must really like you because they didn't give you the lesbian chair  The lesbian couch you're left with DNA samples on your own pants  Believe me  You would have a kid in your pants  Alright so Christy from Rouse.com  Something I do normally  Okay  Because the dollar thing freaks me out  Alright here we go let's crank it up  We're cranking up the music in studio 
[113:00]
 Welcome to the jungle  For Christy  And here she goes Anthony  Okay she's taking off her little top thing  She's got a little sleeveless white number on it  Over  She's dancing  Pants are getting unbuckled  Oh yeah okay  Wow

[115:30]
 Louis is getting that strip club nod in  That strip club nod like yeah alright  That's the way to do it  That strip club nod like yeah alright  What'd he say?  That's a long record  I believe he's a little embarrassed Anthony  Really?  A little bit  There shouldn't be any reason for that  It's just a naked girl that looks 14 in front of him 
[116:00]
 And Rick of course taking some digital pictures for the underground website as always  We know this is radio and it doesn't really make sense when you hear it in your car  But then you go home and you check out the unofficial website and you get to see what we were talking about  Oh yeah absolutely  Foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  We give our listeners the visual medium  Yes  Alright what do you think Louis? Having fun?  Yeah see he's nodding  He's speechless

 The guy that has an opinion on everything  He's finally speechless  He's finally speechless  She's like singing to him and stuff  Totally naked  She don't have a stitch of clothes on though  I see that  I can't get past the fact that she looks 14  Alright  Yeah  Okay 
[117:00]
 Alright  Very nice  Also a lot of people checking in  Because they want to hear the replay of the uncomfortableness that was the rock interview yesterday  We're not going to bore you with the whole hour interview  But we are going to replay the part where it got very very uncomfortable  After our next commercial break  Right after commercial break  Alright  Well right now let's hear it for Christy from Rouse.com  Bravo  Louis?  I don't know 
[117:30]
 Any thoughts? Anything to say?  This is a special moment for all of us I think  Yes  I mean really this 519 this never happens at 519  No  You were given that strip club nod  What do you do with your smile?  You stick your tongue out? What do you do?  It's always so uncomfortable when the girl dances like that for you  You're like yeah yeah  That's boobs yep  But then other things that passes and other things rush through you  They're wrong 
[118:00]
 They're wrong  Very good  But she was good  No kidding that was unbelievable  Rouse.com  Well Louis  You can hang  I will after that I got to  It's up to you but we got to replay that rock thing yesterday  But you could give your thoughts if you like  It's only like a 5 minute segment  Look at Louis he's so easy to convince  Like 5 minutes it would be a tape on can we get another dance? 
[118:30]
 We could probably do that  There was another girl upstairs that wanted to be a lesbian  Did she run away?  A lesbian?  Are you willing to kiss another girl?  No  Wow very very set against that  I like men I was thinking men  Alright I was hoping for a love connection that's okay  But she was like a guy  Do you have a strap on laying around maybe?  Christy very nice body by the way  Thank you  Bravo  Alright more to come I guess we have a lesbian

[123:30]
 The DJ thing  We've been to some things where we had to broadcast with about 30 other radio stations  Like in LA and all that stuff  What do they call that thing  One interview after another  It's like hey Mitch Gumpstein how you doing  You can turn the voice off now  You know we're not on the air  How you doing  You're from that station  And then they go through all the alphabet superstations they were at  How's WGBZ WGBZ WGBZ AKLLD  Who cares

[125:00]
 Are you the guy  That I used to work for them  I'll tell you right now I challenge any of them  They set you guys up so bad  I see it just about as you could tell by the way he was talking to you guys  They're going to set you up because he wasn't even himself  This guy called up a couple of months ago  He said he was sexually abused or assaulted  I was sexually harassed  And when I was a kid I was abused by a ring announcer from the WWF  I used to  Wow thank you for those damage  Let me tell you something 
[125:30]
 You guys go whatever  But they use you like a pole  He knew he was going to do that  He was on the view yesterday  The morning talking about the racial angle  This is a total thing man  Where they knew all along they were going to come out  And they got all the publicity out of this  That they wanted from the New York City area  They just use you guys  I hope that you guys learn your lesson  I don't support them no more  Let me see if Shane McMahon or Vince McMahon  Gives you guys a call ball and tries to smooth things over  They blew you guys up man 
[126:00]
 Alright Tom thank you  Alright  I'm just rolling out of the station  Alright  Alright well everyone is talking about our interview with The Rock yesterday  Anthony it's big news today  We gave our views earlier so we don't want to rehash that part of it  But we want to play for all our faithful listeners  The very uncomfortable moment  I haven't heard this yet  So I guess what we are going to do is start the tapia where we are still having fun with The Rock  Yeah 
[126:30]
 Just joking around and all of a sudden we are blindsided  Absolutely blindsided  And all of a sudden making racial accusations and getting all pissed off  Alright so let's go to the tape room yesterday  Well that's the funny thing is you didn't even try to be a good guy  I mean it just happened  Like he would go out there and say he was the people's champ  And the people were like no you are not  You are just being pompous and saying I'm the people's champ  And then after a while it just caught on  You brainwashed everybody  You hypnotized them or something 
[127:00]
 So yeah he is the people's champ  Hey Chris what do you have for The Rock  I know you are one of the millions of fans  I was calling to find out what kind of injuries you have sustained in the ring  In the ring other than a couple of knee injuries  I had a couple of surgeries already  That done shoulder injuries all the time  Pretty much your typical bumps and bruises  Yeah you can see time and time again  You see like black and blue marks on some of the wrestlers  From going off the ring and everything  What about when you flip over the top?  What does that do to you? 
[127:30]
 Well you won't see too much flipping over the top from The Rock  Not like the Hardy Boys or anything like that  They get into it  That ladder match is still one of the most amazing things I have ever seen  We have Sickboy in the studio  He is like a wrestling expert  You have a quick question for The Rock there Sickboy  He has been chomping at the bit all afternoon  I was actually kind of curious about  Remember the MTV special over the summer  They had the feature on Tony Atlas  Who was your dad's tag team partner  I was kind of wondering if you saw that  And what you thought about  They kind of highlighted some of the hard times 
[128:00]
 That Tony has gone through over the years  And the fact that he was a wrestling expert  That he wanted to kill himself and all that  And just what your thought on it was  With your dad being his partner  Well before The Rock actually answers  I just had a curiosity  The Rock has heard of your name  The Rock has a question for you regarding your website  Oh no  Actually I had no idea it was you  Who goes by the name of Sickboy  But it was bought to my attention last night from the office  That your website carries a lot of racist comments  And I just want to hear about that 
[128:30]
 And for the most part I just want to know  It sounds like all you guys are friends  And if you guys have known that this is a guy  Who has racist comments on his website  And if in fact you guys are behind that  Oh I've seen his website a few times  He's got a bunch of writers on there  And I think they just open it up to everything  Yeah I don't think there's anything ever been racist  No more than any of the humor that goes on in this show  Wait now don't blame our show  I was just going to say that  I don't think there's anything ever been racist  No more than any of the humor that goes on in this show  Wait now don't blame our show 
[129:00]
 Wait now don't blame our show  Don't want to push it for that  Well I'll tell you what  After it was read a couple of lines were read yesterday  They also called me read a couple of lines for me  It said something like  The rock being half black, half Samoan  Doesn't know whether he should go rob houses  Or eat food or whatever it is  And send Jacklins from the jungle  And Mark Henry something about  Him being a gorilla or a monkey or something like that  Elaborate on that  If that's the case if you guys are behind this guy  Then really I really don't even want to be here 
[129:30]
 I really don't want to talk to you  I mean this is nothing that's been written by me  I've got a staff of 15 writers that are on the site  And the site is done as an entertainment site  You know adding humor and just commentary  On what goes on in wrestling  I haven't seen anything that was racist on the site  If there was anything that I ever saw as being too extreme  It would be gone in a heartbeat  You know there's been plenty of stuff that gets to be  Well being saying that Jacklin is from the jungle  And Mark Henry is a monkey  And whether or not the rock wants to go rob houses  Or whatever it is  I don't know what to say 
[130:00]
 I mean I don't think he wants to rob houses  Because he's half black or he wants to eat  Because he's half Samoan  Quite frankly I find that offensive  Well I haven't seen that  I mean I haven't seen those posts at all  I don't know if anybody else has  I'll be honest I've never read any of that  I mean I've never seen one thing up on my site  That would ever be racist  Because that's not you know  That's not how I was raised  And that's not how I would run a website  While it's on there  Well I haven't seen it on there 
[130:30]
 I mean I absolutely be removed  But you know I absolutely do not condone  Nor do I you know support  Any of the statements made  And if you know somebody on there has made racist comments  Like that they're absolutely going to be fired  Can I have an excuse?  Really?  Wow  Alright  Well for the most part it's one of those things where  Again I was contacted I was made aware of it  And the office was made aware of it  And quite frankly I don't want to have anything to do with you 
[131:00]
 I don't want to answer your questions  And if you guys have anything to do with this guy  Quite frankly I don't want to have anything to do with you  Honestly I've never read any of that stuff on the site  And that's the most honest truth  No we have we have a mom whenever we have wrestlers on  He's an expert  Knows a lot about it we have that on  I don't know anything about any racist postings  Like I said we don't condone that either  Well I was bumped by a tension last night  And I read to me over the phone in detail  When you have an open forum especially on the internet 
[131:30]
 There's not really much you can do about that  Well apparently it was from the writers who you must employ  Well they're not paid writers at all  They're hired based on their writing skills  But if I had known somebody was posting that  Well I apologize for anything that you may have taken offense to  I absolutely do not condone that type of writing  Especially on my website  It's something that I put a lot of hard work into  And it's been up for two years now  And we've put a lot of energy and a lot of money into it 
[132:00]
 To make it something to be proud of  And for something like that to be on  It's a black eye to the site and it's a black eye to me  And I apologize to you and Jacqueline and anybody else from the WWF  If somebody had made a comment like that to them  Then they will absolutely be gone  You mean African American site?  Alright, enough with that  Wow, boy that turned around quick  Look at that 
[132:30]
 What the hell are you doing?  So what else guys? Let's wrap this up  Yeah, no problem  God damn  You ruined our interview with The Rock  What happened? We were all having fun  Alright  Well, what happened?  Alright  Well, we still want to thank you for coming by  I appreciate it  Yeah, alright  Absolutely  I hope you don't hit us  Well, no, I mean if you know this 
[133:00]
 And tell them the truth  I'm giving you my word  You don't know much about me  But I honestly have never read anything like that on his website  And that is my word  I'm not backing down or anything  I've never read anything like that  And that's the God's honest truth  I believe it's there  I was pretty much there  For the most part  Again, I was bought to my attention last night  Sent on phone for a good couple of hours  And made the publicist aware  And I had no idea it was them  But I appreciate you guys having me on 
[133:30]
 Thank you  Okay  Book signing starting at  And there it was from yesterday  Oh, that's weird  Isn't that weird?  What a difference a day makes  Thank God Lewis came here to give us some humor  If we had a naked girl yesterday  Everything would have been fine  And the Rock's a little angry with the racists  Oh Christ, look, boobies  And everything's cool  The Rock apologizes for calling you a racist 
[134:00]
 Bring on the gash  We talked about it the first hour of the show today  But basically what pisses me off  And we did say right from the start of today's show  If he wants to come back on our show today  By phone or live, I don't care  I'll say this to his face as well  But I think you got  Come now  Statue of limitations  I said it earlier  I think the guy's a pussy  Because oh my God  No, no, no, he's a stockade  And I would say it to his face 
[134:30]
 And we did say he could come back  And I'll tell you why  Because after that whole segment was done  And we went to commercials  Any man would have stayed behind  And maybe talked for a few more minutes  That guy turned his head and out the door  I'm sorry to say from listening to that  We said that earlier too  We were blindsided  I didn't know where that was coming from  It's yours  My favorite is you go  You know the least we'd say is  Glad you came in and then you go 
[135:00]
 Yeah, yeah, we are  Really glad  Please don't beat us up you huge man  I mean you got a professional wrestler  The guy's giant  Sitting there seeing my every week on TV  Like three times a week  And you know you blindside to like that  And you come back with something  And we're guilty by association  I never even saw what he was talking about  That's what pisses me off  That's the weirdest thing  That he saw it and nobody else  Well I thought a lot about it last night 
[135:30]
 While watching some Amos and Andy reruns  It was  One  Check please  Bellboy  This bag is full  He wants to talk about stereotyping  And stuff like that  I mean we have no problem  With what the WWF does  But why don't you start with your job  Yeah they got a guy called the Godfather  That comes out and says  The black guy  Pimpin' ain't easy he's a pimp 
[136:00]
 He comes out with four hoes  These strippers that come out with them  Anybody want a piece of my fine hoes  Pimpin' ain't easy  I'll be pimpin' 24 7  Like these total black stereotypes  But that's okay  That's right and the Rocks check  They exploit stereotypes  I have no problem with that  Exactly they cut to check  So he's not going to say anything in house there  Isn't it a little weird how he didn't even break character  Because he wasn't in character the whole time 
[136:30]
 But that whole thing how he talks about himself in third person  Didn't stop  Like usually somebody would say  Hey I'm not going to answer your question  Because the things you put on your website pissed me off  He's like  Well the Rock isn't going to answer your questions  He's like I've been informed about this  And the Rock is a little  He's like well who are you talking about  Bring the Rock in and we'll talk about it with him  He still talks about himself in third person  It's a little weird isn't it  He does that all the time 
[137:00]
 He does that in bed with his wife  The Rocks slamming you right now  The Rocks giving you a good one isn't he  Take your head down from between your legs  Because you guys are by the biggest marks in the business  Biggest marks  What do you mean biggest marks  You guys are the biggest fans  The Rocks are climbing up there  We explained it all earlier  We were in complete shock  What was going on  And we gave him the form again today  Because now we're a little more prepared  About what he wanted to bring up 
[137:30]
 And we're ready to go  Ready to go  We did say that  He could come right in here right now  Now that we have 15 guys with us  I know yesterday it sounded like you guys were  Ready to get on that motorcycle together  Right hop on the jet ski  I'm pissed off at myself  I'm totally freaking pissed off at myself  Oh  Totally  We completely came off  Like we backed down  And just gave in 
[138:00]
 We came off trying to sound like  We were trying to explain ourselves  And we're stuttering muttering  You're stuttering muttering  I'll get you again  Five long members in a Smackdown hotel  We were just in shock  I just couldn't believe what was going on  Alright  Alright bye  What do you got Mark  What about yesterday as he's plowing through the millions and millions of fans out here  Mark steps up to him and goes  Hey would you like to cut an ID for the Open Amity show 
[138:30]
 Jesus Christ  You got some set of balls Mark  He's going to go punch me  He could have  They say he has an age problem  Hey I just wanted to say  There was really nothing wrong with anything you said  You know there was a lot of confidence and everything  It was just hard to hear because you could hear a sound of knees knocking in the background  Oh I'm not going to lie  I was like because you know  I mean I did some research on the guy  The guy has an age problem 
[139:00]
 No it sounded like it was set up  It sounded like it was set up  I had to use some baby powder from the rash I got from wetting myself  To tell you the truth when I got home  Take care guys  Alright man  I mean you got a room with a professional wrestler  I mean the concept is a little odd  Just ask Richard Belser  Just ask Richard Belser  That's on Hulk Hogan like he chokes them out  Yeah no they're not  I mean it's a completely psychotic  Now they have a 
[139:30]
 Now I'm mad again  They've got a restaurant in my corner  Oh yeah  Because you know what when I think World Wrestling Federation and this thing  I think is food  You know  We're cordially invited  Sweat and grunt and make noise  I think God you know what I need chicken wings  God in heaven  They yelled about Disney coming in  What about them how nuts is that  Two blocks from my home  If I'd known that when I was a kid  That this is what I was going to end up at 
[140:00]
 I'd have killed myself  Paul from well from right around the corner  You guys sounded so guilty  And like such pussies  Like little school kids being scolded by the teacher  See that's how I feel that at least I came off  I'm not I'm not very happy with the way  We handled that yesterday  Well maybe you could spend some time in church over the weekend  I think I will  I'll light a candle for myself  I think I'm going to  Hey Joe what's up  I have a confession to make  I had to speak in this is the best in my wrestling 
[140:30]
 What's up  Hey you are a genius man  Thank you thank you  I read this guy's posts  Really?  We have a public service announcement from The Rock  I just like to take this opportunity to thank The Rock  Because yesterday we were at 5,000 hits  Now we are at 20,000 hits  20,000 hits  You guys are a bunch of pussies if you don't put the posting up  Oh please once you realize it you're not going to get sued  Everything will be back up  Our big gimmick will be making fun of The Rock from now on 
[141:00]
 Cool  I have something else to say  These are the rules  Thank you Joe  The Rock is cooking  What a fricking moron  He is the biggest hypocrite on the face of the earth  I think yeah I agree with you  I don't blame you guys  You are in a bad position  I wouldn't  I'm sorry I'm just locked up and trying to get in all day  I didn't really care about that  I was in shock  The guy works for the raciest company on the face of the earth 
[141:30]
 He makes his money off doing those things  He's a big hit  He's a big hit  He makes his money off doing those kinds of things  What's he going to say about a website that is basically praising him  Making a few jokes  This is a bunch of crap  Thank you Joe  Matt  I'm sorry Matt  New rule  That's McBeth  You've got to read some of his posts  They are hysterically funny 
[142:00]
 He's got this whole thing now on here I guess  A public service announcement from The Rock  He wrote it and puts these pictures  I guess of The Rock's action figure  And he talks like he's The Rock and stuff  Like this guy's got a set of balls  He don't care  It's pretty funny  Pete what's up  Hey Pete  Did we lose Pete  Hey Pete what do you got  It's Tom by the way  Oh Tom it's just Pete on the screen sorry  Dude I'm about to go work the book signing  You guys want me to do something like ex-wrestling all over or something 
[142:30]
 Just whisper in his ear  Opie and Anthony say hi  Maybe apologize to him  No I ain't about apologizing to him at all  I apologized yesterday and that's all he's getting out of me  I didn't even really apologize  I was trying to tell him what I knew which was nothing  It doesn't matter  This book sucks man  It's terrible  There's a lot of pictures in it  Yeah 5BSNWWF has got no story  He made it big from the start  He's going to end big  Alright Pete 
[143:00]
 What story do you tell  What is the story  I wrestled somebody we set it up  I'm going to win he's going to lose  What's the story  I exercised for a while  I ate a lot of that bionic crap  I got bloated muscles  Then I was up against the tick  And we had to sign a contract  And then I want  What is the story  It's about 8 pages  That's a big cartoon Anthony  Hell yeah 
[143:30]
 That was the you know what  I like that cartoon  Oh sorry what's going on  My man I heard yesterday  I was kind of  Come on man  Why were you apologizing to him bro  You should have thrown him out of the studio man  You should have thrown him out  You should have said you know what  We have nothing to do with the website  The man you want to speak to is right in front of you  And he's my friend  Off mic  You know what I'm saying 
[144:00]
 You went around and turned it into one of those fake  You know what I'm saying  How soon before the WWF goes bankrupt  That's why I think he's a pussy  For not even discussing it after the fact  When we're in commercials  He should have said you know what  He's about to cry like a little baby  Little bitch  Come on man  And that was going to happen  You guys have been getting good press in the magazines  And everything that was going to happen with that  I'm not talking about the incident today on your show  Who said that

 A bunch of people around here  No man  What do you mean come on  It's too real it happened to us  We got to like discuss it you know  Alright old dirty  Anything else about it  Nah man I mean I was surprised  I thought it was like a setup or something  Like a joke  I thought it was a bit man  I said oh why she's going to take  That's why we started laughing  When he first said I got a problem with your website  I thought something funny was going to come out of his mouth

[153:00]
 He's always a pisser  He's out of friggin' control  Great friend of the show too  Earlier he was just doing some top shelf stuff Anthony  Alright, that's a friggin' sick boy  He's just got this whole posting that he put up on his site  And he titles it, Is That a Train?  And it's about the whole thing  His whole view is on Dwayne Johnson 
[153:30]
 I guess he would not refer to him as The Rock anymore  Us and how we and him handle the situation  Other websites that have bashed him  Us  Getting their facts wrong  Pretty cool post  I'm wondering, he says he wants to personally thank us for not dumping the blame on him  Because they could have easily done it to cover their acid  As a friend of the show and a guest of the show  I have an unlimited amount of respect for those guys  Good, thank you  Will this BS affect my relationship with the show? 
[154:00]
 It doesn't matter one damn bit  Are you doing a rock thing there sick boy?  Will it affect the show?  It doesn't matter  No, he says it doesn't matter a bit  What about our relationship?  Your relationship with the show?  No, definitely not  Chuck, are you there?  What's up Chuck?  How are you guys doing?  I was hoping you guys would put Lewis in a coma  Maybe I could have got him spotted at the Gotham Club  Not Chuck  You know Lewis is very intense 
[154:30]
 If you ever see him on stage  His veins are popping and his glasses fogging up  You guys drained all his energy  What kind of show are they going to get?  He gives it all every time  You should see the veins popping and his eyes popping out from two feet away  It's frightening  You know what?  You guys should have got The Rock to cut the ID  That would have been cool  This is The Rock whenever I'm driving away from a robbery  In my stolen car and eating fried chicken  I like to listen to opening hands  Oh my God 
[155:00]
 Chuck, please  Can it be said that you are a black man?  Put these racist comments  If it will help our cause, Chuck is a black guy  Yeah, I'm an octoroon  I'm not a half-breed though  Alright, after today we're not going to be talking much about The Rock at all  Hey, Ope, I've got to give it to you  You've got some balls overnight  You're calling The Rock a pussy and everything  Yeah, let's him walk through the door  Yeah, but I preface it by saying 
[155:30]
 Look, I would say this to him  And he's more than welcome to come in and we'll confront him again  You know what?  Screw The Rock, man  You know what I'm saying?  I can say that because I'm miles away  So you know what?  If you've got any problems with The Rock  You know who the hell is The Rock  Alright, it was just ugly yesterday  Nah, you guys did the right thing  Truthfully, after listening to it again  You really didn't pussy out 
[156:00]
 Because he was a guest on the show  In your house  And you guys were treating him that way  You were treating him like you were trying to be polite  You were trying to...
