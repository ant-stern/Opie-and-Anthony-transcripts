 It is Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us.  Do you know what's going on with the New Hampshire Farmers?  What?  Do we care?  What?  Don't like politics?  Yeah.  I think George W. Bush is going to be the next president of each United States. That's about it.  John McCain! John McCain!  Oh.  They're all a bunch of goofballs. I hate them all. 
[00:30]
 Yeah.  I mean, freaking Al Gore, they're trying to make him look human. And the fact is he looks like he's a robot.  He looks like Frankenstein when he walks. They have him shaking hands there in New Hampshire and he's just like...  That ain't going to work.  No.  But George W. Bush will be the next president of these United States.  And I love Bill Bradley, but I mean, I got to say it because this is what happens. He just looks like a slob.  It's like Bill. Like, press your suits. Do something. Come here.  He won't be elected if he looks like a slob. 
[01:00]
 No, I mean, they say the only reason Clinton was elected was because he looked so good on TV and the women went crazy for him.  Yeah.  What the hell happens?  What lady is going to vote for Bill Bradley? They're all going to go for Bush.  Yeah.  No, but they will. Like, he's got everything going for him. He's got the father that was the president.  He's got vote loads of cash behind his campaign. He's got the backing of the Republican Party.  And the Democratic Party is a bunch of goofballs.  And he looks good on a snowmobile. 
[01:30]
 Oh, yeah, yeah. You see the snowmobile?  At least he can pull it off. Remember the Michael Dukakis fiasco when they were like, hey, you know, he'll look cool in a tank with his big tank helmet on.  Oh, you look like one of those Mets things in the back window of the car.  That big head bobbing around?  That was it. His big head sticking out of the tank. That lost him the election right there.  You've got to think when that footage happened too that they filmed it ahead of time and his people had to look at it and go, yeah, we'll use this.  What are you, stupid? Look like a retard. Like you should be on a short bus. 
[02:00]
 But George W. is doing all the right things, you know, not talking about the cocaine issue.  Everybody bringing that up at the beginning when he first started saying that he was running.  Apparently, there are reports that he was into coke back when he was young.  Who would think, you know, your son John in the 80s doing coke?  Wow. I think he was the only one. He was the only one and I believe it's dead now.  Dead now. 
[02:30]
 Vinny, that's pregnant today's argument. This is Vinny here. Vinny!  Yeah.  What's up?  I have a question for you.  What's up?  I have a question for you.  What's up?  I have a question for you.

It's not a question of saying when one people's better than the other. 
[07:00]
 Right.  Everybody does wrong things.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye, let's go to Greg.  Greg, you're next on NAW.  What's up?  I'm meeting for president.  Come on.  He's the man.  He should be the next man in charge.  He's speaking the truth.  Is he lying?  Oh my God.  Look at the statistics.  Yeah.  He was perfectly honest.  When it comes down to it, he's a man.  He knows what he's talking about.  That's all I got, fellas.  Take care.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  I'm a third generation American. 
[07:30]
 My parents, my mother and father were born here.  Their parents were born here.  My great-great grandparents were born here.  When they came to this country, they came to this country with nothing in their pockets,  and all they asked for was a job to work for pennies a day to perpetuate their own family 
[08:00]
 and their own race.  Now these people fought over on inner tubes.  You hear this song about Cubans drowning.  For God's sake, guys, you know, something you don't understand what I'm saying.  And now they fought over to the country on inner tubes, dead bodies, whatever.  They can get to here and they put their hands out and say, what about me?  What about me?  I agree.  There are wars around this freaking country.  It's a fight.  No vacancy.  Put the no vacancy sign up.  All right, Pete, thank you.  That's it.  Well, I agree with the immigration thing.  Yeah, I got you there.  People completely outraged now, Anthony.  Enough.  Vinnie hit a nerve with everybody, it seems like. 
[08:30]
 I wonder why.  What he was saying wasn't too controversial.  Vinnie's back on the air here.  Vinnie, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  I thought you were finished.  No, my phone went out on me.  But one guy was wanting to know what I was.  I'm Italian and, you know, enough for nothing.  And Anthony could back me up on this.  Oh, yeah, and blunt me in.  Okay.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

[11:00]
 I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, 
[11:30]
 I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean 
[12:00]
 .  So just just a minor technicality. 
[12:30]
 Well, let me tell you something about history.  Back then, it was like the beginning of a monopoly or something.  You know,  you just kind of bump into a country and you claim it and you kill everyone and then you you own it.  That's how it had to be done back then.  You conquered places that was the way of the world.  I do gotta say thank you to the Spock people for lending the money for the boats.  That was pretty cool.  Our contribution in history.  Queen Isabella.  Okay, both.  Thank you. 
[13:00]
 Thank you, Frank.  That's all she wanted was some of Columbus' Italian sausage.  Queen Isabella.  I think he had a nailer for those three both.  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  I can't even believe these ones.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a bitch that.  Dream wreck radio.  I'm going for it.  This is sicker than faces of death.  Hello Mark.  Are you ready to play Hi Mom I'm in Jail?  Sure.  Alright, now what are you going to tell your mom, mom?  I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her 
[13:30]
 I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her  I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her  I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her  I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her I'm going to tell her  I'm in jail.  I'm in jail.  This is sicker than faces of death.  Hello Mark.  No, are you ready to play Hi Mom I'm in Jail?  Sure.  Alright, now what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I don't know, I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  You're going to tell her that you were with a couple of prostitutes?  Yeah.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  Yeah, I haven't been to jail in like about 8 years, so. 
[14:00]
 So, she thinks you've cleaned up your act huh?  Yeah, I don't have any malle, you know, they've got a shoot out of the hospital.  You look like an old man.  I'm probably married, you know?  Oh, and you're married and you got called the prostitute?  Yeah.  Maybe you can tell her something like you can't tell your wife, obviously, so you had  to call her.  Yeah, I had to call a couple of them.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good.  Here we go.  All right.  She'll be ringing.  You're going to have to speak up real loud because the phones really suck.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ma!  What?  Listen, it's Ma!  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail!  What? 
[14:30]
 Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got a call with a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark!  It's your son, Mark!  Where are you?  I'm in jail!  Where?  In Lowell, right here.  Downtown.  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You!  With what?  Oh, get away from her.  I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call my house.  Oh, this call is being monitored, ma'am.  Okay.  I didn't know she was joking with me.  Is she serious or what?  Mom, serious.  I'm serious.  I'm serious. 
[15:00]
 We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That would be cash.  Five thousand?  Yes.  What did he do?  It was found with a couple of prostitutes in the Lowell area, one of which was a transvestite.  And it's a serious charge, ma'am.  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma!  He's in Lowell?  Ma!  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell.  What?  He's in Lowell. 
[15:30]
 Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Yeah, because now the newspapers print all the Johns that were caught with prostitutes.  So his name will be emblazoned for all to see in the Boston Herald tomorrow.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins?  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has a tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem  he's going to have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am? 
[16:00]
 Yes, I'm here.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am.  What?  I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I take him out with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah. 
[16:30]
 Oh my God, I can't do this anymore.  Ma!  I can't do this.  Ma!  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am.  Yeah?  Happy Mother's Day, ma!  Joke.  This is the worst.  It's all a joke.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, man.  Ma!  She's all right.  He's fine.  He's not in jail.  Why?  Your wife wants a radio.  You could smack him in the head.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's fine. 
[17:00]
 Ma, you still there?  Yeah.  Talk to us, ma.  Look how upset.  Oh my God.  I gotta make a phone call.  Call us back.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Usually I can joke, but I'm always joking with her.  Oh, no.  I'm the one who's joking with her.  We feel horrible now.  You gotta smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye. 
[17:30]
 Oh, my God.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys want to take to.  What level?  Me?  Stop.  107WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you in love with each other?  Yes, we're home moms.  Love gay people.  Love gay people.  Yes, we're home moms.  It's so easy to get guys naked.  Yes, we too have a lot of pent-up sexual frustration.  Yes, we're coming out.  We're gay. 
[18:00]
 Hey, is this the whole point of an interview show?  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Two guys who are not afraid to love each other.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to it.  1027WNEW.  Hey, Anne, your mom did say I was hot.  Aw, come on, mom.  Don't bang on people.  You f*** my mom.  I'm f***ing yours.  Oh, disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  What the hell is wrong with you? 
[18:30]
 I'm f***ing you.  I'm f***ing you.  A couple of real motherf***ers.  That sounds good.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey, man.  My buddy, my pal.  What's up, Dan?  My partner in crime.  Hey, Anne.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show,  the most talked about radio show in the entire country at this point.  Wow.  Let's not kid ourselves.  Everyone loves to hate the Opie and Anthony show.  Isn't that funny?  And we laugh at all of you. 
[19:00]
 I'm hiccuping.  I've laughed so hard.  We laugh at all of you.  Yeah.  I love how people love to spell out our impending demise.  Remember like the first three months we were here?  It was going to be over.  We were out of here after three months.  Yeah.  It wouldn't last.  Then it was six months.  They'll never make the new year.  Oh, yeah.  Then they'll never make a year. 
[19:30]
 Okay.  And then they'll never make the...  It just keeps going and going until, you know, two years later.  What?  We're past a year and a half to this point.  Yeah.  I don't worry about it.  It doesn't look like we're going anywhere anytime soon, people.  Any of our detractors that like to say, well, I guess that's it.  You know, they took a little hit in some of the ratings and that must be it.  Oops, sorry.  Why are the bosses around here patting us on the back and congratulating us and trying to get us hookers and stuff? 
[20:00]
 At this station, it doesn't seem to matter.  It'll take quite a while for us to get down to a .5.  Or a .8.  So we still have plenty of time while we really screw up.  I gotta say, I gotta say, because I know he's listening because he's such a loser.  Tell me, Tom, you took our bait and you're such a loser.  We laugh at you today.  Do you think you're ever going to get to us?  You loser. 
[20:30]
 He's attempting to trash the only, the only show on N.E.W. that's making money for this company.  What are you talking about?  You got a Brian on the car phone.  Brian, how are you?  Jam-like.  Eddie, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just wanting to talk about like if.  As soon as he got on, he was like, you know, how could you, who could help?  They went from 14 to 7.  How could they talk, you know? 
[21:00]
 Hey, Eddie, we got under his skin so bad he had to spend another hour on his syndicated radio show that supposedly is all over the country.  The country doesn't know who Opie and Anthony is, but he's helping us out on that front.  Now people all over the country know who Opie and Anthony is.  He also brought up money later on, but a couple hours into the show he started talking about Anthony.  He said that Anthony is probably going to lose the CD radio and the divorce.  You know, and then I called up and I said that's not true. 
[21:30]
 And he hit me in the head with a u-lock and then he was talking about, you know, Anthony's mom, then Anthony's smoking again.  I don't know where this guy's going.  Anthony's smoking again.  He's lost in space, Opie.  I know, that's why I just hung up on him.  Let's go to Ed next.  Ed, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Guys, Pubby Tom.  Yeah.  Come on.  All right, I got a few points to make.  One is that he was making a big freaking deal about how Z197.1 beat you guys. 
[22:00]
 Meanwhile, it is a known fact that music stations get ten times more listeners than any talk station.  You know, we don't need anyone defending us today.  We said it yesterday, too, that we took a hit in the ratings.  Yeah, you guys did say that.  But the fact is, and this is a major fact, which he even slipped and said during his little rant last night,  that what matters the most when you do a talk show, and I are now in the talk show genre,  is to do very well 25 to 44 with men, okay? 
[22:30]
 Anthony, what are our ratings for men 25 to 44 this past book?  Number one, Opie.  Thank you, Anthony.  That's right.  That's all that matters.  That's all that matters.  The 12-plus number is a bragging right.  We would like to be higher.  But the truth of the matter is we're not pulling in 12-year-olds, 13-year-old, and 14-year-old boys or girls. 
[23:00]
 And we're not getting the upper end of the spectrum, the 60-year-old men or women either.  We have a very loyal following.  We're making an S-load of money for the company.  They are very happy with us.  And that's the truth.  What's pathetic is Tom Likus, we set the table for him.  When we get off the air at 7 o'clock, we have a huge, huge audience.  Yeah, that's another thing I was going to say.  He would have no one if it wasn't for you guys.  He doesn't have anyone.  Hold on! 
[23:30]
 The .8, those listeners come from you guys.  Ed, a .8, you might as well have no one listening.  The fact is that there's a religious programming station out of Jersey that beats Tom Likus at night.  And contrary to what Tubby Tom says, our show today is not going to be a three-hour infomercial for the Tom Likus show.  No, it's a quick thrashing and then we move on.  And then that's it.  And the fact is every time we do talk about him, his numbers don't go up because we just tell everyone to stop listening to you, Tom. 
[24:00]
 We hated you from the beginning.  We still hate you.  I guarantee you this, Tom.  Tom!  I know we get under his skin and that makes my day, trust me.  Jam!  I will guarantee you this one, Mr. Likus, okay?  Aunt and I will last in New York radio much longer than you will.  That is a fact.  Aunt and I are up to 19 months, you're up to three months. 
[24:30]
 You want to wager to see who lasts longer, pal?  I would like to say it wouldn't even last a year, but they'll probably give you a year just to be nice about it.  Come on!  Because we have bigger problems with this radio station than getting rid of the Point Eight Night Show.  You know what blows?  What blows around here?  The guy is in the crapper, takes a big tank again, per usual, and we get lumped in with it. 
[25:00]
 We're doing very well, thank you very much.  Then you've got to open up the post and read how no one's listening?  Not to this show.  We have people listening.  We have a huge audience.  All you have to do is go to the Super Bowl party to figure that out.  The post, they see NEW has a 1.2.  I don't even know what the station is at right now.  It's a 1.2, Anthony. 
[25:30]
 The average is 1.2.  Let's just put this in perspective so people can understand this.  The station is at a 1.2 overall.  Our morning show is a 0.5.  Prepare to Howard's 9.0, just to put it in perspective.  Then Mid-Days is a 1.1, I believe.  You and I shoot up to a 2.9.  2.9, and we hand that whole audience over to Tom. 
[26:00]
 Who in return hangs onto how much of that audience?  Point, point, point, eight.  People punching out like mad.  There's a station, all they do is religious broadcasting out of Jersey that beats him at night.  Wow, better than Jay or on a car phone.  And he was talking about honesty on his radio.  If you want to be honest, what does he talk about where he got his Flip Him Out Friday idea from? 
[26:30]
 Flip Him Out Friday, okay.  Or whatever he calls him, Flash Him Friday.  I honestly don't know.  The fact is, and this is the reason why we hate him and we'll never support him,  we know for a fact that he stole that idea from us.  It's a rip-off of our Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We said it the first day he was on the air that we won't acknowledge him and help him out until he admits  that he stole the greatest radio promotion of all time.  Thank you.  Just in case you're wondering why we hate him so much. 
[27:00]
 He talks about being honest.  Come on, Tom.  Tell him.  Tell him about how you were down in Turks and Caicos.  Broadcasting live the same week Aunt and I were.  With Sam Adams.  And how Aunt and I were doing Whip Him Out Wednesday down there.  And the whole island was loving it.  Thought it was unbelievable.  And you even admitted on the show that  But I call it Flash Friday.  That you started the promotion about a month after you got back from Turks and Caicos. 
[27:30]
 Totally different.  I got it on tape.  You said it.  A month after you got back from Turks and Caicos when you were broadcasting live at the same promotion we were for a week straight.  You start this great promotion of yours.  Come on.  That's why we hate you and we'll never support you and can't wait for you to be gone.  Point eight.  That's an embarrassment.  We hand you an audience you can't even keep it.  Well, who the hell wants to talk about him anymore?  Load.  That load.  Crap. 
[28:00]
 John, what's going on?  John!  John, what's up?  John, what's going on?  John, what's going on?  John, what's going on?  John, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey John.  Hey, my name is Joe.  How you doing John?  Hey, we're going to take you out like a style.  This clown spent the whole, his first 15 minutes of his show defending how come his ratings suck. 
[28:30]
 Well, there was a subway series that was building and a whole station revamped.  So he spent the first 15 minutes defending about how his show sucks.  And then after he finished getting himself on some sort of solid ground, he decided to take pot shots at you guys.  That's fine.  I'm not going to mention him by name.  I don't care if they mention me by name.  It gives me ratings.  The only reason why I listen to the SOB is because he happens to fall on the radio after you if I'm doing my driving late at night.  John, that's fine. 
[29:00]
 You don't have to defend us because you know what?  We were in our office laughing at the top of our lungs going we got him again.  We got under his skin.  That's a syndicated show that's syndicated all over the country talking about Oprah and Anthony.  Who wins?  Who wins, Tom?  You loser.  The guy only talks about things that he thinks he has a strong standing on.  He picks on women and how his whole philosophy of men.  The guy's a freaking joke, number one.  Number two, if he's had any sense, he'd understand the philosophy of radio, the way you guys evolved, the way you guys paid your dues where you needed to and kicked ass where you needed to. 
[29:30]
 And hopefully grow.  This guy's going nowhere fast.  John, our ratings are fine.  With everything that went on in the last three months, we're very happy with what we got yesterday.  And we're still number one with the demo that matters the most.  Men, 25 to 44.  And with everything else, fine.  They go up and down.  Who cares?  But it's nice that they do go up as opposed to certain other shows. 
[30:00]
 The biggest embarrassment of this radio station is the Tubby Tom Show, by the way.  We know our morning show sucks and all, .5, whatever.  But they don't have a lead in the morning show at all.  They have to start from zero.  And they don't do much better from zero, obviously, zero to .5.  But to hand somebody the huge audience that we get in the afternoons and then turn that around and get a .8, that's an embarrassment. 
[30:30]
 That's an embarrassment.  Come on.  .8.  A .8!  Unbelievable.  Makes me want to pull out of Yulah.  Danny, what's going on?  Yo, what's up fellas?  I tried to get through to his show.  Danny from New York, how you doing?  You're on the John Likus Show.  Hello, Taff. 
[31:00]
 I tried to get through to his radio program and his gay lover slash phone screener, Mike Douchebag.  He got all the information.  I hit him with everything, the listener parties, how he stole your promotion and stuff like that.  He kept me on hold for 15 minutes and cut me off.  Of course.  You know why?  Because he's so calculated.  The one thing about our radio show, we'll just go to the phones, you want to trash us?  Fine, do it.  We don't care.  He was so calculated, the point he wanted to make, he made sure the calls followed suit. 
[31:30]
 Yeah, of course.  That's sad.  He had the corneas, you know, to take some abuse from your fans.  He doesn't have the balls.  He doesn't have the balls.  I confronted him when he was live in New York for a week.  We went right into his studio.  He couldn't take it anymore.  He turned off our microphones.  He got so freaked out.  You were making fun of my voice, my radio voice.  We have a copy of that, we have to play that on our show. 
[32:00]
 It is so freaking funny.  I started mocking his voice and he's like,  Yeah, you got to play that, man.  I wanted to rip him a new one for you guys.  Keep up the good work.  Bye, man.  Bye.  We're just about done with this and then we'll start our real show.  Who's this?  Raul?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  That guy is so horrible, man.  He's trying to abuse you guys.  He's scared to say your names. 
[32:30]
 I love when DJs do that to Aunt Nye.  Everyone knows who they're talking about.  They're too scared to even say our names.  That guy is horrible.  That's some brave radio.  You guys can do me a favor.  Can you put on the Mike Tyson video again?  Come on, man.  We're trying to record this.  If we have a slow part of the show today, we'll do that.  Can I say hi to my sister and my brother?  You just did.  Is Chris the Wreak coming?  No, you're alright.  Jeff is going to try to explain what Tubby Tom was saying last night. 
[33:00]
 Jeff, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  I got through to him.  I called him up and I was like, I just want to tell you how much better you are than ONA.  They let me right through.  When I got on, I just wanted to discuss how your ratings dropped.  So the first thing I had in my mouth was,  nobody wants yours to drop because you don't have any to drop.  They won't let me through if I say,  I like ONA and I want to rip on you. 
[33:30]
 I want to rip on him right away.  He takes this whole thing a little more seriously than we do.  We openly laughed at the speaker last night when he was talking to the whole country about OP and Anthony.  What a loser.  The only reason I was talking about you guys was because you don't want to lose your listeners.  He knows we're going to listen so we can try to rip on him.  We talked about him in the beginning when he first came to New York.  A lot of people checked him out because we started talking about him.  It didn't help in the ratings. 
[34:00]
 It's going to happen again.  We'll fade away and stop talking about him again.  His ratings will continue to be sucky.  I told him, I said, know who you're better than?  He goes, who?  I said, the morning show.  He goes, oh thanks.  I said, well, you know.  He started up in the morning.  As soon as he came on, he said, I'm going to read off all the names that are ahead of me.  He read off the Spanish station.  I told him, you're right below the Spanish people. 
[34:30]
 There's only 1% of them around here.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  There you go.  There's our cute little response, Tom.  It's not going to be a three hour infomercial.  Still number one men, 25 to 44.  I know how important that is.  Don't you, Tom?  You know how important that is, right?  You would wish for that, wouldn't you?  You're never going to get it.  Ever, ever, ever.  Come on!  And I'll say it again. 
[35:00]
 Aunt and I will outlast you in New York.  We're up to 17 months.  You've got three under your belt.  Let's see how this one plays out, Anthony.  Yeah.  You laugh at you.  All right, let's start our real show now.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Ace all those tubby Tom calls.  We're not spending any more time talking about them.  That's it.  We've got a good show today.  We've got Gary Conrad coming in, the hypnotist. 
[35:30]
 Are you going to try to be hypnotized today, Aunt?  I'll sit down and see if he can do it.  Why not?  Who else is going to get hypnotized?  We've got to get Spaz again because he was priceless last time.  Oh yeah, priceless.  That was great.  Well, we've got to start by you.  What are you going for this time, an Emmy?  Come on!  We've got to start with you confronting Gary Conrad.  You don't believe in this.  Sorry.  And you will attempt to get hypnotized today.  I'll take a stab at it. 
[36:00]
 We've got to get Psycho Mark to get hypnotized as well.  Psycho Mark has basically said he'll do it.  All right, cool.  We've got a couple of listeners down and I think we're going to have a good show, guys.  Good stuff.  I'm encouraged by that.  Rick says we're going to have a good show, Anthony.  Thank Christ.  Jesus.  Thanks, Gelman.  Oh, dude.  Gelman!  Rick's like Gelman, just trying to get mic time. 
[36:30]
 You're like Gelman.  I am not.  Where are the hawks?  Or all of a sudden Gelman has to say something,  because he's trying to get like freaking camera time.  Okay, you got me.  Gelman, time for our Millennium 2000 trivia contest.  Who wants to be a cocot?  All right.  Our facts line, 2129579.  Kathy Lee, your knobs.  They're hanging like cow orders. 
[37:00]
 Wear a bra for God's sake.  Gelman, get her a bra.  All right, and our facts line, 2129579639.  Phone line, 2127571027.  And it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for listening to the number one show with Ben, 25 to 44, Anthony.  That's right, Opie.  Let's not forget that fact.  It's an important fact, okay?  They forget about it when they write in the paper. 
[37:30]
 What did you learn on the show?  I learned how to function like an idiot without a high school diploma and a job in a radio.  Opie and Anthony.  The fear of the mindless.  1027WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for tuning us in.  We appreciate it.  It's 1027WNEW. 
[38:00]
 We're patiently waiting for Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, to make his way through the studio door, Anthony.  He's got his work cut out for him today, because...  Sure does.  Anthony has become a skeptic.  Yeah, just doesn't believe in it.  I'm amazed by that because I know that Rick or Spazz would have told us by now if they were faking it, if they were acting, if they were going along with the hypnotist.  And to this day, they swear that they're not going to be able to do it.  They swear they have no idea what was going on. 
[38:30]
 I still don't buy it.  Even Rick said he was looking at the tape when he was under hypnosis and he couldn't believe the stuff he was doing.  Don't buy it.  What's in it for those guys?  I just don't believe it. I don't know what's in it for them.  I think maybe they wanted to believe that they were hypnotized.  Maybe they were just acting for the show.  I don't know. It went too far for him to say now that he was goofing. 
[39:00]
 Talk to Rick Gellman.  Shut your ass.  Rick Gellman.  Yes, Anthony and Opi Lee.  You were indeed hypnotized, you say?  Yeah.  So when you were acting like a child in the corner, you had no control over your body.  You were completely out of control.  If there was a fire in the building, you would have cowered in the corner like a child and died because you could not snap out of it and be an adult that you are. 
[39:30]
 I have no idea.  You can't say because the situation didn't happen so you don't know how your body is going to react.  You couldn't at any point sit in that corner, nothing in your body.  You couldn't.  You couldn't.  That would be a great test though.  Hypnotize someone to be a child and then all of a sudden you tell them there is a fire and they have to get out and see how they act.  I am buying it.  Are you filming our show, Steve?  I am not buying it because Rick also had that look on his face.  It's that I am BSing look when he is trying to be serious.  No, it's not. 
[40:00]
 His mouth does something very distinct when he is lying.  I can tell when he is BSing.  I can tell when he is lying.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  About that whole thing I am not sure.  All I can tell you though is that I remember the part where I couldn't curse and I had to do some Chinese crap.  I remember it a couple days later when we were talking about it.  How frustrating it felt when I recalled that because it wouldn't come out of my mouth no matter what I said.  I remember that. 
[40:30]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that. 
[41:00]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that. 
[41:30]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that. 
[42:00]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that. 
[42:30]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that. 
[43:00]
 I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I remember that.  I have nothing to gain.  It's supposed to be hypnosis.  It's for the show.  It's whatever it is. 
[43:30]
 I don't like you guys that much.  I still don't know what your intentions were during this whole thing.  What your whole thing, motivation was for doing that.  If you remember, I wasn't even going to do it.  Opie kind of pushed it on me because we were lacking a few people.  A few people backed out.  So I was kind of a last minute, alright, I'll do it.  What the hell?  Well, alright.  I find it.  We've set the table here.  We'll see what Gary Conrad has to say.  Bill, what's going on?  Bill!  Hey, what's going on, man? 
[44:00]
 How are you guys doing today?  Good, you're live on the radio.  What's up?  Cool, man.  Listen, I almost asleep at the wheel here.  I know you guys heard about the rating yesterday, but I'm wondering if you might be able to hypnotize that man sitting in colostomy and having some personality or something.  Oh my God, I tried them guys this morning.  They're horrible.  So maybe the hypnotist could help us get some ratings.  Well, that's what I'm thinking, man.  I don't know.  Take the two or three of their fans and hypnotize them guys or something.  That's something to ask them, Bill.  Thank you.  Good luck, guys. Take care. 
[44:30]
 Kevin believes.  Kevin, you're next on NEW. What's up?  Hey guys, I've been hypnotized and I've witnessed others be hypnotized.  I'm pretty sure it's the real McCoy, man.  Is there some kind of cult thing, Ant, that these people are coming out of the woodwork to defend the hypnotist?  I don't know what it is.  Well, I'll tell you guys, I saw a guy hypnotize about 12 people when I was in high school.  And they were doing some pretty outlandish stuff, flipping like he said that these guys were looking up at an airplane in the sky and everybody was waving to him, flipping him to bird.  This one guy got up and mooned them all.  It's the real thing, man. I'm telling you.  All right. Thank you, Kevin.  All right. Have a good one.  All right.  I'm going to go ahead and turn this off.  I'm going to turn this off. 
[45:00]
 I'm going to turn this off.  I'm going to turn this off.  I'm going to turn this off.  I'm going to turn this off.  All right. Thank you, Kevin.  All right. Have a good one.  Bob from Freeport on the Instant Feedback.  Have them...  What word can we use? We can't use the P word.  Have them urinate themselves. That should prove it once and for all.  Because who would do that? 
[45:30]
 We might have to challenge Gary Conrad to make these guys do some just incredibly outrageous, ridiculous things.  I don't know.  I'll agree to whatever he says.  I'll go through the whole process there.  We'll see what happens.  But I'm very skeptical.  Keith, what's going on?  It's not Keith. It's Pete.  Listen, here's the situation.  This is why Anthony can't be hypnotized.  This is why Spaz is so easily hypnotized.  Spaz has no will. 
[46:00]
 If you have self-control  and you have your own spade and wand,  you know it's in your head, your thoughts, your control.  Anthony has that kind of personality.  You can see when they talked about...  Remember when his buddy came over, I can't think of the comedian from the Olive Garden.  And they had to make the...  It was the...  They had the little spy cam coming down to the airship.  He's so technical and he's so  persistent that his body won't be hypnotized.  His mind won't be hypnotized.  That's his problem.  However, Spaz will do anything, anywhere.  For example, liquor stains feet in front of other people. 
[46:30]
 And then have Anthony admit in front of everybody that it wasn't him.  And by the way, ask Spaz...  Ask Spaz...  Dude, put down the pipe. Slow down.  I'm sorry, man. I get excited when I talk to you guys in the phone.  I love your show. You guys are great.  I think you touched on ten different things in 30 seconds.  We lost you.  Am I trying to throw it at you?  I'm still here.  The point I was trying to make was that  Anthony's not going to be hypnotized  because he has a strong will.  That's the problem.  It's all conscious mind. 
[47:00]
 We got a lot of questions to ask Gary Conrad.  And one more thing.  Just ask Spaz,  what does Anthony taste like?  Very good.  I got a lot of e-mail before the show  and they said that they can't really hear  what Anthony was confessing  at the Super Bowl party.  Oh, really?  I'm just going to tell people  that Anthony in front of  over a thousand people said  I F'd on the couch.  Thank you. 
[47:30]
 Don, what's going on?  I've seen the hypnotize  be done.  I don't believe it works.  It's just like they're all acting.  You know why I don't think it works too?  Because it's bad acting.  The normal one-of-the-mill person  that you take off the street  isn't a very good actor.  And they don't do very well  under hypnosis either.  Obviously there's limits.  If you're a brain surgeon  or a good actor, 
[48:00]
 I think it has to be within their abilities  normally.  It's like Spaz,  you're a hooker trying to get money out of Anthony.  And he's like,  hey baby, it's just like bad acting.  Why would he do that though?  For the show.  And not fess up to it at this point?  Why would he do that?  So you're saying because he sounded like Spaz  it wasn't believable?  No, because it was just bad acting.  Not because he sounded like Spaz.  Who else is he going to sound like? 
[48:30]
 Are you thinking in cartoon terms  of Bugs Bunny, Hypnotize,  where it's so over the top?  Me? You guys are thinking  that the lightning bolt is coming out of the eyes  into the head and all of a sudden he has no control.  He's in the corner like an infant.  I saw Rick acting badly  as an infant in the corner.  Think of it as breaking down  the walls of self-consciousness.  You're not opposed to doing any of this stuff.  Sure, you can act like a baby.  I don't know. 
[49:00]
 You could try to smooth it over  with as much psychobabble as possible.  I ain't buying it.  The thing that they did was so outlandish  that they might not  be able to do that on their own.  I think Gary made it a lot easier  for them to do that by making them meet.  He sat there for 40 minutes  and calmed them all down.  What if someone is hypnotized?  I walk up to him like Rick is in the corner,  an infant, and I go, Rick,  what are you, a jerk-off? Look at you.  You look like an ass or try to make him laugh. 
[49:30]
 I wish I would have done that  because I think I could have totally  made him laugh and broken him down.  Then maybe you shouldn't be hypnotized today  and you should try to mess with the people  that are hypnotized.  Chris, what's going on?  When I was in high school,  we had a guy named Amazing Neil on our senior trip.  We had about 400 people in the senior class.  He said, anybody who wants to try it, get up.  Probably about 30 people got up.  I was one of them. I was a little bit of a skeptic.  He said, if it doesn't work after the first five minutes,  you know it's not working. 
[50:00]
 At about 30 people, about 10 people sat down.  He had the shyest kid in our senior class  making out with a microphone stand.  Some people worked, but I went up there  a little skeptic. He had people  dirty dancing, guys and girls  laying on each other that wouldn't have touched each other  sober.  Yeah, I've seen all that before.  I truly believe this stuff.  Thank you, Chris.  Joe Soprano checking in from the Bronx.  I would like to see Gary hypnotize one of the guys,  namely Psycho Mark, to pick a booger and eat it. 
[50:30]
 That's lovely.  I hope this backfires on your ass, Ant.  I hope you go under like that.  He's not.  If I do,  he's dancing a jig or something.  Thank you, God bless him. He's an amazing man.  Let me go on record.  Let me go on record.  I believe in this hypnosis thing.  Yeah.  There's no way Ant's going under.  We'll see. We will see what happens.  I don't want to look foolish later. 
[51:00]
 There's no way he's going to go under.  See what happens, man. You never know.  You're going to be able to let go and trust him  and just go with it and see what happens.  I promise you, I will do everything he says.  I will relax, I will close my eyes,  I will take a deep breath, whatever the hell he wants me to do,  I will do.  I will clear my mind,  I won't sit there making jokes and goofing.  I will go through everything the way he wants me to go through it.  Okay, very good.  And we'll see what happens. That's all I'm saying.  We got to take a break, Anthony?  You're listening to the number one show with men, 25 to 44. 
[51:30]
 No one else wants to talk about that,  so we better toot our own horns.  Everyone else wants to make us look like losers in the paper and on the internet today.  So we'll say it.  We'll say it.  Oh, listen to the lineup promo. Who's missing?  OPM Anthony afternoon. Mason and Kulinski more now.  The Radio Kick midday on 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's OPM Anthony. 
[52:00]
 Hey, what's your stuff? I ought to say hi today, Anthony.  Abil.  Cowbell B.  Abil.  Hasn't been on the show in a while?  Yeah.  Hey, Bill, you haven't seen your buddy Anthony in a while?  Or are you digging his new clothes?  Ooh, look at that.  There must be somebody new in your life.  Bill, at least there's new clothes.  Because I can't get my old one. 
[52:30]
 You know, she took everything, man.  The clothes are gone.  I took one little batch of clothing.  That was it? Your computer and ran?  Yeah, like my computer and a few clothes and stuff.  I thought I'd be able to go back and get the rest of my clothing.  No.  Well, the phone rang today in the office.  Rick picks it up.  Do I ever pick up my effing telephone in the office?  Ever, ever, ever.  Never, ever, ever. 
[53:00]
 I mean, we're in meetings. The phone's ringing.  I'm like, I don't care. I'm not picking up the phone. I don't pick it up.  Why did I pick up the phone?  Because you thought it was the Hard Rock calling back to bring us lunch or something.  But why would they have my phone number?  Because I gave them an extension.  Why did you give them my extension knowing I would never answer the phone?  Because you were on Opie's extension doing an interview.  I explained this to you.  Regardless of how it happened, I never answered the phone.  Rick answered the phone and goes, oops, I guess I shouldn't answer that. 
[53:30]
 I guess I shouldn't answer that.  So now I pick the phone up.  It's the Future X.  Oops.  You know, talking about a couple of finances and things like that, you know?  Some issues, sure. 
[54:00]
 I bring up the point that I'd like to come by maybe and get the rest of my clothes at some point.  Seems that, um, seems they somehow made their way into goodwill.  Our own Ziggy that we had on this show is probably wearing some of my shirts.  I can get some clothes.  Yeah.  Seems my clothes are bagged up and shipped out. 
[54:30]
 Great.  To goodwill.  We could at least auction them off on the show.  Yeah.  You can believe it's like, oh yeah, come by and get some of my clothes.  Oh, clothes?  Like how many men we have.  Pants underwear, $4.95.  Yeah.  Seems, uh, seems the clothing is not an issue anymore. 
[55:00]
 Don't feel bad.  And I had a friend of mine show up at a club one night wearing his work boots covered with tar, dress slacks, and the vest for the dress slacks.  No shirt.  I look at them.  I look at them.  I go, Chip, what happened?  Yo Billy man, she took everything.  Just the vest.  Just pants and crotch. 
[55:30]
 Crotch and boots.  She took everything.  Big ass hairy chest.  With just the vest on.  Hang out.  And he had to go down to the bar.  He had nowhere else to go.  He had nowhere else to go.  With the vest on again.  Yeah, this work man.  Yo Billy man, how'd I look?  Biggin' Chip man.  Chip, Chip, yo Billy man, yo Billy man.  The best part of this story, Ann went back to his place. 
[56:00]
 We've talked about it in the air so I guess we can bring it up again.  Yeah, I had to get my computer equipment.  But see, at that point you had a chance to get your clothes.  It just shows you how much you really like your computer.  Well, I only had a limited time.  A limited window of opportunity.  Because I gotta say something, at that point you didn't start shopping for new clothes.  I mean, your jeans were starting to smell.  Of course it smelled.  Now first of all, you know, screw you. 
[56:30]
 First of all, it isn't like that.  I have clean clothes and I shower.  Ass.  I was just messing with you.  Holy smock.  No, I took all the clothing that I needed.  But there were just other things that you have in your closet that you don't wear that often.  Ta-da.  Speaking of that window of opportunity, how did you get in there? 
[57:00]
 Through the window of opportunity.  Well, yeah.  I was thinking in my head, based on previous things that had happened, you know, I won't go into any details.  I was under the assumption that if I went and knocked on the door and she was home,  that I wouldn't have been able to get in to get my computer equipment.  So I opted to take the other chance, which is to just let myself in, let's say, 
[57:30]
 to the house that I was paying rent on anyway.  Can you picture that?  That was me.  Isn't that that famous radio guy's butt hanging out in the middle?  I was hanging down from cables through the roof, trying not to set off the floor alarm.  I was hovering over it and a little bead of sweat fell off my forehead.  It almost hit the floor, but it landed on my arm, I think. 
[58:00]
 Here's their computer equipment. Let me just pop the disc out.  Oh, I've got to get my porn. God knows what kind of trouble that could make for me in a court of law.  Yeah, I wasn't concerned more with my computer equipment than what was on that hard drive.  Why can't I reformat this thing?  Sink me for sure. Yes, must reformat hard drive.  So I reclaimed my computer equipment, and now all that was over there that I figured I would go by at some point and pick up was my clothes, which, good will. 
[58:30]
 I still don't know the fate of my radio-controlled helicopter.  Something tells me, same fate as the old NBC traffic chopper.  Same fare just as well as Stevie Ray's chopper, I do believe. 
[59:00]
 What about that great mountain bike we got?  No, I got that. You got that?  I got that when I went to get my computer. I strapped that to the roof.  That's how I made my getaway on the mountain bike. I asked Rick to borrow his mountain biking pants, and I strapped everything to my back.  Well, look at the bright side. There's some poor, unfortunate kid with a brand new helicopter flying around with an FN Talk at 1027 t-shirt. 
[59:30]
 Jesus Christ, we should have a new contest. Spot Anthony's clothes on the street.  If you find any of my clothing, let me know. It would be some WAAF Boston shirts that might turn up.  Some LEW stuff. Some beer and liquor t-shirts. Plenty of Budweiser clothing.  I got my golf clubs too there, Bill. We could still play some golf. I love your priorities. It's great. 
[60:00]
 Computer, mountain bike.  Toys.  The clothing was like an afterthought of what I threw on top of the golf clubs.  PJ, what's going on? PJ? Do we lose PJ? PJ? No? PJ? Okay. PJ? No. He had a good one too. 
[60:30]
 There's nothing else there. Okay. That's very funny, Anthony.  Well, you know, it's life, Obeid. You're left with more than I did.  Corky Anthony. What were you saying, Bill? Yeah, Bill. You're left with more than I did.  Yeah, Bill kind of went through a situation. It happened to be summer. All I had was shorts and a t-shirt. 
[61:00]
 And you got, Bill, what? Wiped out. Everything wiped out.  Can you retell the story? That's one of the funniest stories ever. Cute little story.  You know, I had a story about how a couple of weeks ago my love life hit rock bottom.  A couple of weeks ago? You want me to tell this story on top of that story?  A couple of weeks ago something happened? Yeah. 
[61:30]
 Your love life hit rock bottom? Look, he's all... Look at his face.  It's embarrassing. I didn't hear about this one. It's pretty embarrassing.  What happened? It's... Well, there's two stories in one, actually.  I'm at the local watering hole, Pepper's. Sure. And Friday afternoon, half the hour, I usually hang for a couple hours and I go home.  That was the deal. I was ready to go home. In walks the nerdiest looking guy you've ever seen in your life.  I'm talking crew cut, coke, bottle glasses, you know, the pencils in his top pocket, sits down, orders eight shots. 
[62:00]
 I'm like, this guy isn't with anybody. Right? Bangs. All eight shots. Tequila, I think.  So I said, you know, I gotta hang out and watch this. You wanted to go home, but...  You know, I mean, talk about out of his element. You picture the front row at a Rolling Stones concert.  1969. The camera's panning across the front row. Bikers, hippies, and all of a sudden there's Pee-Wee Herman.  That's where this guy... So he looks at me and goes, hey, you want to do with Dr. Pepper? 
[62:30]
 I'm like, the hell is that? You drop a shot in a Guinness or whatever? That's a Huntington drink all the way.  You know, I did one. I'm like, you know, that's not bad. He's buying them.  So I'm like, okay. And I'm banging them. I'm like, this is pretty good.  The last thing I remember was saying, I don't think I should drive home.  Right? That was the last thing I remember. I woke up Saturday morning.  Now, you know how water beds work? Yeah. You know, water displacement, buoyancy? Sure. 
[63:00]
 Normally my alarm clock is right at eye level. Right? I wake up, I'm like, oh no.  Why am I looking down at my alarm clock? Uh-oh. Yeah.  That meant somebody was on the other side pushing down on that bed, thus lifting you up a little more than you're used to.  270 pounds worth. Oh my God. Where did you find... I'm like, what the hell?  You don't even remember? No. No. The last thing I remember was saying, I think I should get a ride home. 
[63:30]
 And you ended up with a chick that was 270 pounds? At least. Were you hypnotized? At least. I was hypnotized.  Oh my God. Now, I got up and I said, you gotta go. You have to get out before any of my pals come over here.  I never let it down. Oh, it's too late now. I went back to the bar the next day to get my car.  The whole place was looking at me like, are you nuts? 
[64:00]
 But yeah, Phil's nailed some pretty quality tail in his day, too. You know? Like, it's his reputation.  He walks out with a hammer and he's like, whoa, he's slumming tonight.  I think that hammer carried me out. Put me in her back pocket and took me home.  Oh man. So anyway, they said, you know the guy that was buying you those Dr. Peppers? I said, yeah.  They said the paramedics had him show up, hook him out on his stretcher. 
[64:30]
 That's a good night. You were the lucky one, I guess, huh? Yeah, all time low. All time low.  That's a good story, too. I know. I would have been. Too funny.  All right, we gotta take a quick break here.  Waiting for Gary Conrad to show up to hit the test. A lot of good phone calls on hold. You guys stay there. We'll go to you next.  One oh two seven WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony show. Sitting in today, Cowbell Bill. 
[65:00]
 We love Cowbell Bill's stories. He hasn't been here in a while.  Hi, Bill. Steve from the unofficial website hanging out. Bill from the old neighborhood.  I haven't been out there in a while. How was it out on the island? I know. I like being out there.  I've been out there quite some time there, Bill. Give Bill some headphones, please.  Let's go to the phones here, Anthony. Tom, you're next on N.E.W. What's up? 
[65:30]
 Hey, O.N.E. How you guys doing? Hey, we're doing all right.  I just jumped in. I hear Anthony telling that story about going home and getting his computer out.  It reminded me a month ago. My wife, I would have trouble and she got me a restraining order.  I can't go in the house. So I'm walking out. I've got no clothes. I've got nothing to do.  I'm walking around the block. I'm waiting for her to leave the house.  I break into the house. I feel like such a criminal going into the house.  I'm creeping around making sure nobody's watching me. I get my clothes. I get home.  She cut all the buttons and all the pockets out of all my clothes. 
[66:00]
 I got home. I put my pants on. I stick my hands in my pockets. There's no pockets in my pants.  Nothing at all. I don't know if that happened to you, but jeez.  Cut the buttons and the pockets out.  Cut the buttons off my shirts. All my good shirts. No buttons.  I put my pants in my pants pockets.  She must have known I was coming by.  Alright, Tom. Thank you.  Before you leave, this show couldn't beat that Saturday morning health show you guys got.  Tom Lykous. I don't know who he is, but thank you. Thanks for the call. 
[66:30]
 Mariah, what's going on?  This is Sophie Anthony.  Hi, guys. I just wanted to tell Anthony I could definitely relate to that.  Because when my marriage broke up, I got the three guys in a truck to move me, and I had to wait until my husband left.  I had to help them move because we had to move that fast.  Here's the three guys and me moving the furniture out. They had a two-hour window.  I could definitely relate to having to be out in a hurry. 
[67:00]
 Did the three guys have anything to do with your marriage?  No, it had nothing to do with it. Actually, Anthony, I had a husband that didn't want to work,  and I was working free jobs while he was banging somebody in the house. That's why I left.  Hey, I can relate to that.  Thank you, Mariah.  You're welcome.  Bill, you're going to tell the other story. You've told it before, but it's a killer.  Bill Heddaic.  Just like that girl said, I'm working my butt off. I'm sending my wife to school to become an RN, paying for the house. 
[67:30]
 She finally gets a job as an RN.  I can't look.  And starts banging the doctor.  Oh, man.  Turns out to be my best friend's second cousin.  So I said to him, I'm like, hey, what's the deal with this guy? He's like, oh, he bangs all the nurses.  Just to give it up.  Great. So I basically got booted out of the house, took everything, left me with nothing. 
[68:00]
 And my mother's saying, well, don't worry, honey. What goes around comes around.  I'm like, yeah, my rice.  There's no way this is ever going to even out.  A couple of years later, I hear from my best friend that the guy gets in an accident with his Jaguar, bites off his tongue. 
[68:30]
 And they can't find it.  I figured I'd give him a jingle.  You called him up?  I called him up. Remember me?  Cat got your tongue?  Dick.  Wow.  I asked my wife, how's that feel?  He's giving you little stuff. 
[69:00]
 I love that story.  True story.  Sue, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi. How are you doing?  Great.  I just have a drinking story for you guys.  Drinking story?  Yeah.  How did we get there?  Well, you were talking about...  From Phil's other story.  I was talking about drinking. I just figured you want to hear a drinking story about my husband and I.  Sure. Why not?  We were out partying with a bunch of friends. Went to their house.  We were skinny dipping.  We were getting totally ossified. 
[69:30]
 We happened to be up the street.  Drove home.  Throw up in the driveway, my husband and I.  He could only drag me into the garage.  And we wound up sleeping naked on the garage floor.  And my children had to cover us up.  16 years old and 13 years old were taking care of mom and dad, drunk and sleeping on the garage floor.  That's a sight they'll never ever forget.  You know what? I hope that they kind of got something out of it.  Of course, we didn't get much out of it. 
[70:00]
 That'll screw you up for life.  It was hysterical.  Your parents drunk and naked in the garage.  You taste like antifreeze.  It's totally embarrassing to have your kids taking care of you when you're ossified and naked.  Yeah.  You screwed them up. That's it.  They kind of rigged us for a while over it.  I catch one of those inadvertent down the shirt looks at your mom or something. 
[70:30]
 She goes to bend over or something. You just turn and look.  You're like, oh, God, I just saw my mom's boobs.  You're like, oh, son of a bitch.  12 years old, cut shock, that exact thing.  I think that was how it happened.  It happened. You're like, oh, God.  They're like, F'ed you up for a while.  You don't want to think about that.  You don't want to think that your mom's fat.  Yeah, it's bursting in your head.  Swing and boob. 
[71:00]
 You're like, oh, God, come on.  Come on, mom.  Mike.  Yo, what's up, ONA?  I got a story for Bill there.  You want to talk about fat broads in the bed.  One time.  Not really, but go ahead.  Listen, I'm in the ball one day.  I'm 6'4", like 325, right?  I'm hanging out.  I wake up the next morning.  I look over.  There's this cow that's the size of a friggin' couch with legs.  Sitting there, she's about 4'11", 250 pounds.  And just a big swab.  I'm looking at her like, holy Christ, what the hell did I do? 
[71:30]
 I got a girlfriend at home that looks way better than this.  I'm like, oh, Jesus, what am I going to do?  So I look over.  I look again.  I scroll.  Let me pull another one in.  So I'm over there.  Whoa.  I push the legs up.  It's like you ever pull on a branch on a tree and it snaps back?  Nort has these legs, like big rubber cow legs.  I'm banging this thing.  Her stomach is flowing like two water beds.  I'm like, oh, my God, what's going on?  I get up.  I finish my thing.  I said, hey, see you later.  She had a $40 cab ride.  I said, yeah, good luck.  I'll catch you later. 
[72:00]
 Good luck.  Well, I have to say, I had my jeans and sneakers on.  You know what?  Oh, you did?  That's the first I looked at my sneakers.  I was like, whew.  Not for nothing, fap rod is not a key to happiness, though.  Four in the morning, you're sitting there drinking all night.  There's going to be one flop sitting on the bar.  Oh, man, Mike.  You're like, hey, you know what?  You either go home with me or you're going to go home and pick crumbs out of the couch  again, fat dog.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you've all been there, so don't deny it. 
[72:30]
 Wow.  Don't deny it.  Because they'll do things nobody else will do.  Like, do you mind if I put this there?  Really?  Can my friend put that there, too?  All right.  Can I put this remote in there?  Oh, excellent.  Did you ever see one trying to get out of a water bed?  Say that again, Bill.  Did you ever see one trying to get out of a water bed?  No, no, that's a frightening fact.  It takes like 15, 20 minutes.  There's stuff rolling all over the place.  You jump on one side, Bill, and the fat boy just rolls out the other side. 
[73:00]
 That's how you wake her up.  You wake her up.  You wake her up.  Go to Mike and go underneath there.  Make me something, because I know you know how to cook, you fat flop.  It sounds like you have a lot of experience with this, Mike.  Oh, well, yeah, I like to go hogging now and then.  All right.  Good luck, fellas.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks in a while.  You got to roll a fat one.  With that, let's play a couple tunes.  We'll be back.  Maybe Gary Conrad got scared.  Maybe, because you want to confront him today. 
[73:30]
 He hasn't shown up yet.  Poof Fighters.  Everlong.  David Grohl arrested for driving drunk on a moped.  On a moped.  Way to go, Dave.  It's 1027WAW.  Opie, you scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonic little bastard?  107WAW. 
[74:00]
 Caitlin.  Hi.  How are you?  Caitlin.  How old are you, Caitlin?  I'm 28 now.  Man, you're a little old to have the name Caitlin.  I thought that was one of the most popular names that only hit like in 1990.  Well, I'm sorry.  Caitlin is like the Gertrude of the roaring 20s.  Gertie.  Gertie, you know?  Hey, Gertie.  Back in the roaring 20s, I bet Gertrude was a great name for women and little girls, but  Mildred.  But you just don't see that name anymore. 
[74:30]
 Caitlin is the same thing.  Eventually it's going to run its course, I think.  Ethel.  Men find Caitlin very cute.  Well, yeah, but there was a time Ethel was a great name.  Ethel is a hot number, Rick.  I gave her quite a banging last night.  And Bertha.  Those names all were cute in their day, too.  Those were all hot.  Back in the day, it was like, hey, man, you see Bertha?  Yeah, I'd like a bang Bertha.  Oh, yeah, look at Gertrude. 
[75:00]
 What are some of those other names from the past?  From the roaring 20s?  There was Gertrude, there was Bertha.  Abigail.  Mildred.  Abigail is a good one.  There was Hortense.  What?  Hortense.  There was Judy.  Hortense.  Maybe in your neighborhood.  Hortense.  That wasn't it.  That wasn't it.  Hortense.  I don't remember any Hortense.  Harriet.  Harriet and the Harriots used to be hot.  Harriet.  Can you imagine a hot broad today walking around the streets of Manhattan and her name is Harriet? 
[75:30]
 Imagine banging an Agnes.  Banging an Agnes.  So like, I got Penelope doggy style.  Let's see, like, Caitlin works.  You know, you're sitting there like, yeah, yeah, Caitlin, right?  There were probably some jocks in the 20s, like, you know, talking dirty to a Gertrude.  That's cool.  Not like a Thelma or an Eleanor.  Eleanor, there's an Eleanor.  Oh, man.  Who would ever name their kid Eleanor after...  There's Eleanor.  Eleanor Roosevelt. 
[76:00]
 Yeah, after seeing that mug.  You know.  Eleanor is now like a lesbian name, I believe.  You ain't had it till Winifred to hand down your pants.  They'd call her Freddie for sure.  Hey, Freddie.  Freddie.  Hey, Barney.  What about Hillary?  Hillary used to be out there.  Yeah, that's an old name.  Not as old as like a Bertha or a Bertrude or...  An Abigail.  A Harriet.  Harriet.  Oh, man.  When I got Harriet, yeah, had a bun of hair going, yeah, Harriet, you do it.  A Eunice.  Eunice.  Eunice was another one.  I'm going to take you like Hitler took Poland. 
[76:30]
 Out of fight.  23 seconds.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69, Hildegard.  Come here.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of punks.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Then I'll leave a bruise.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm going to show you the roaring 69.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of punks. 
[77:00]
 God, I want to punch you in the face.  Then I'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 if you want in on the show today.  Cowbell Bill hanging out telling some of his stories today.  We always like it when Bill stops by.  Bill, good friend at the shop.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  And if you want to send hate email, you're allowed to do that as well.  Because it gets filtered to us and then we read them and then we get to laugh real hard. 
[77:30]
 Yeah, we don't care.  Let her rip.  Dear WNEW, I've been an N.E.W. listener since 1968.  Wait, wait, wait.  When did this come in?  This sounds like one of those, the beginning of one of those we used to get when we first  got here.  Oh, I know.  No, this is, no, it came in today.  Huh.  All right.  I got it back through yesterday's show so they couldn't wait to get this in the boss's  hand.  Oh, okay.  Dear WNEW, I've been an N.E.W. listener since 1968. 
[78:00]
 Groovy.  And I was never as appalled by anyone in radio as I was by the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  We like that.  Never as appalled.  When they were playing recordings of Kirk Douglas' voice and ridiculing him.  Were we ridiculing him or just pointing out how bad life is?  How tragic.  Tragic.  All of a sudden this guy was a strong guy, actor, ladies man, Hollywood.  You see Spartacus, you know. 
[78:30]
 Spartacus.  Look at you, Spartacus.  You're freaking beautiful.  And then you tack on a few years and you get the guy he is now, you know.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Well, he was talking the other day about his son having another kid.  His 57-year-old son having another kid.  Yeah, that's not too selfish.  With Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Would you like to hear the clip again, Ann, before we move on with our hate mail? 
[79:00]
 All right.  Catherine, okay.  I'm very happy for both of you because I want more grandchildren.  I only have three grandkids.  Oh, poor guy.  They call me, my name is Kurt.  It's really sad.  It is sad?  But what was this guy's problem?  That we played it?  I got to interrupt our hate mail.  Another radio station talking about us. 
[79:30]
 Everyone likes talking about the opiate, Anthony.  Yes.  Darren, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Opiant?  How are you guys doing?  We're doing all right.  All right.  I'm a long time listener.  About a year now, you guys kick ass.  Thank you.  Anthony, when you did that Tyson thing the other day, I literally pulled over and cried.  Yes, I try to make people weep.  Could be the best thing Anthony has ever done.  Wow.  I think it was, Ann.  I absolutely think it was.  Listen, so when you guys...  I got to be honest.  When you guys go to commercials, once in a while I'll turn on K-Rod or, I'm sorry, that 
[80:00]
 other radio station.  No, you can say it.  I don't care.  There's nowhere else to really go for music.  We understand.  I find it funny that people make believe they don't turn away when the commercials come on.  That's what you do when you're listening to radio.  You listen to some commercials and then you see what else is out there.  What the hell do you think we do when we drive home?  Listen to Tubby Tom?  I say listen to...  Hey, Maggie.  I'm Cain, I guess.  Listen to some music on K-Rod.  The only good thing about you guys other than Howard is at least your commercials are a 
[80:30]
 minute long, not 30 minutes long.  Anyway, so I turned on the other station and Pandavis says, he says, John Rocker is to  baseball as those two other guys, those two other DJs are to radio.  Two other DJs?  Those two other DJs.  Then he said it like three times in a row.  Wow.  Then before he plays a song he goes, well, I think you guys know who I'm talking about.  Yeah.  And if you don't know who I'm talking about maybe you can give me a call and I'll explain  this a little. 
[81:00]
 So I should call them.  If you guys have three white let me call him on the online.  Darren, don't even bother.  Yeah, he doesn't even want to.  Let's mess with him, bro.  Don't even bother.  He's doing that because he is just trying to get us to talk about him.  That's all.  I'm surprised he had time to say anything in between those 92 minute...  Rock blacks.  You know, they don't let him talk about it.  That's got to make you feel so good as a jock knowing that you got hired and your PD just  tells you, look, play a lot of music and don't talk a lot. 
[81:30]
 But I want to showcase my talent here.  I'm K-Rod.  Can I have to...  No, no, no.  Look, look, look.  You can play the rock songs.  You can intro like another 92 minute rock block that's coming up.  But please don't talk much.  I like for the first couple of months not talk too much.  I can do that.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, well, ever.  Ever.  Like, Obi and Anthony, they're allowed, you know, pretty much speak their mind.  Whatever they want to talk about, they can talk about.  If, you know, you want to deem that being the John Rockers, well, whatever. 
[82:00]
 You know, we're just talking.  We let people get on the phones, talk about what they want to talk about.  That's how this show works.  But for you, I just want to, you know, maybe in between the rock block, maybe talk about...  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  You are an air, no personality.  That's it.  Just, just seg the songs.  All right, but what if I...  No, seg the songs.  Yeah, but in between, there's going to...  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[82:30]
 No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  You're not understanding me.  We hired you.  We really feel that you are a talent.  Can I interject here?  Yeah.  Did Steve Kingston have like cotton in his ears that day when he was listening to that  audition tape?  We just love the way you said 92.  You know, and fitting it into the rock block thing is just brilliant.  And we really love how you say the word rock.  Rock, rock.  It's never been said that way in New York before.  I could go with that for a while, but maybe I could... 
[83:00]
 Easy, easy.  Don't get excited.  Calm yourself.  That's got to suck.  You get a job and you're just singing too.  If you're a DJ and you get a job where your main thing is 92 minute rock blocks, that's  pretty sad.  Coming up by an hour and a half, got some rage against the machine.  That's just got to be great. 
[83:30]
 Make no mistake.  If you get into radio, you want to be able to talk, to express yourself, to have a show  based on your ideas and the ideas of your callers, have something interesting going  on on a daily basis.  That is the dream of anybody on the radio.  If they're telling the weather, if they're doing traffic, if they're saying 92 minute 
[84:00]
 rock blocks, the ultimate goal is to talk.  Bob, it ain't happening over there.  Shut her down.  I can see Kingston saying that to Will.  Your talent, it shines through the music.  When a 92 minute rock block is playing, people know that behind that music you're sitting 
[84:30]
 pushing those buttons, starting the CDs, stopping them, playing the commercials, putting the  CDs away.  They know that's you, that's your talent.  Bob, what's going on?  Hey Bob, you're on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Listen, I just want to say one thing.  By giving this nut juggler time on your show, all you're going to do is help him out. 
[85:00]
 Because the more you talk about him, the more you're going to help him.  The only time mentioning somebody's name helps them out is if they're any good.  Yeah, if they can back it up with talent.  Because then a lot of our listeners will go over there and then they'll hear this rock  block name.  And then they come right back to us.  It's temporary ratings to him.  It's when people don't mention the names that they're a little afraid that they might  send people over there and then they'll listen and say, hey, wow, that's pretty fun or interesting  or whatever.  Good.  Well, I just want to say one quick thing. 
[85:30]
 I just started listening to you guys about three, four weeks ago.  And I think the thing that separates you guys from everybody else is when callers call up,  you treat them like the good people.  Listen, I come to get on the way.  I use the F word, I want to apologize.  We had to talk about that.  Sometimes we do things just for our own entertainment.  Bobby Diamond, baby!  All right, take it easy, man.  Thank you, Bob.  I got a little rambunctious.  I said, S-U to the guy. 
[86:00]
 I think you feel threatened by Will and you just lose him.  Maybe that's it.  I want to play a rackblast.  You know, we could be one better than him and do a 93 minute rock.  It's one more bet.  Do you think when the ratings come out and that day part goes up that he really thinks it's because of him?  Yeah, that's the funny thing too.  He's like calling the PD and stuff and going, hey, how was my rating?  Let me pop through the numbers here.  Let me crunch some numbers. 
[86:30]
 Hey, look at that.  I went up like a fraction.  But hey, I went up.  That's because of the way I say rackblast.  In reality, he went down.  Yeah, he did.  So not terrible.  It's the music.  But then if it goes down, he could say, well, it's the music.  It's the music.  Hey, boss, you're giving me music.  I can't play a rackblast with this music.  My rating is going down.  Keith, you're next on the radio show.  Hey, Opie Namby.  Earlier you were saying how old? 
[87:00]
 Wait, how old are you, Keith?  12.  Oh, OK.  It's so funny when you read up on there that he had a story about when he was 12.  Oh, yeah.  And then it like just happened.  He is 12.  He is 12.  I thought it was a 30-year-old guy that was going to tell us a story when he was 12.  But it's actually a 12-year-old talking about Keith when he was 12.  Yeah?  You realize kids your age over in Taiwan are smoking bots and firing machine guns and taking  over countries and stuff? 
[87:30]
 Oh, yeah.  You see that in the news?  They're chain-smoking.  What are those two kids' names?  They're like twins?  Wang and Wang.  Wang and Wang.  Wang and Wang.  They're 12-year-olds.  They puff bots and like shoot up stuff.  How sad is your country that you can't like, you know...  Because you can't crush a rebellion of 12-year-olds.  Right.  That's hysterical.  Throw some porn at them.  They'll stop instantly.  How sad is that?  Dad, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you're saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs. 
[88:00]
 What?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando?  Commando!  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God.  I try to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on them?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened...  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was Mom taking it from behind or what?  Oh, my God!  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over their shoulders. 
[88:30]
 Wow!  That's the high how you're doing.  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh!  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Then what happened when they saw you?  Their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out. 
[89:00]
 Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh, God!  Oh, man, who are you, Rick today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning.  Terrible.  I think I'm spaz.  Hey, this kid's quick.  Even 12-year-olds think I'm spaz.  Sorry, man.  So did you enjoy it?  I mean, was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Oh, yeah, I guess.  That sounds awful. 
[89:30]
 You'll remember that for the rest of your life.  Yeah, has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question, what hole does it go into?  I bet you know.  My father said, whatever one's open.  Oh, my God! 
[90:00]
 Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one.  Oh, my God!  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I guess you'll do okay.  Anything else?  I'd rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right, so does your mom, Keith. 
[90:30]
 Call back anytime, all right?  All right, there he goes, Keith, everyone.  He's very funny.  He's very funny.  Funny little lad.  Chris, you're next on the radio show.  Come on, Opie, that was a really bad man.  Isn't that?  That is so wrong, man.  It was wrong on many levels.  I apologize.  I got hit on the head really bad today.  Yeah, you did.  My noggin is all messed up.  I think he got a conclusion at the brain.  Oh, man.  You're killing me here, bro. 
[91:00]
 All right, Chris.  Thank you, Chris.  I agree with you.  That was totally out of friggin' place there, Opie.  I know, I know.  I'm not thinking right today at all.  Vinny.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Vinny?  Hey, this is racist Vinny.  I don't want to be known as Vinny the Racist, but...  Oops, too late.  Jesus Christ.  You know, this guy, this Wilpent Argus, whatever his name is, I never heard of him before.  Go check him out.  I encourage all our listeners to go over there.  Yeah, why don't we...  Check out the comedic stylings of Wilpent Argus. 
[91:30]
 I don't care...  That's how scared we are.  We'll even give him a commercial.  Go, go, go right now.  Check him out.  Yeah, I want him.  I don't care how he compared you guys to John Rocker.  What does that mean?  Because you guys aren't afraid to open your mouth?  Is this guy against the First Amendment?  Because you guys aren't afraid to say, nigger?  You have to say the N-word?  What does this couple want us to...  Well, we are, Vinny.  Say the N-word.  What's happening with this country?  Oh my God. 
[92:00]
 We just try to speak our mind.  Well, here's another one.  You watch the news and you hear these people are so afraid to say the wrong thing.  They have to say, African-American.  Vinny is an angry man.  When they talk about white people, we're just white.  I mean, start calling me an Italian-American.  Let's put that in front of everybody.  No, could we not do that, Vinny, please?  For the sake of all the Italians out there.  Come on, Anthony, stop.  Come on, you know what I'm saying is the truth.  I just want to ask you guys.  I just want to ask you guys if it's possible if I could go head to head with O.D. on... 
[92:30]
 I mean, face to face, maybe on your show with a little...  I don't know, just talking about the things that are going on in this country.  Because obviously he sees things from a weird point of view.  I mean, this guy thinks O.J. was innocent.  I mean, I don't know what's wrong with this guy.  Yeah, well, you guys will go at it again.  You think it's ever possible we could meet face to face?  Yeah, what the hell?  Seriously?  There's a guy that wants to rip you today.  Oh, come on.  I think we did this yesterday, but we'll give Chris a shot.  Chris, what's going on? 
[93:00]
 What's going on?  I just called two seconds ago.  I'm back on because that little punk ass bitch, little racist Vinny, I'll rip you a new one.  Hey, Sag, I weigh 240 pounds.  I'll bust your head open.  I'm not 260, bitch.  Yeah, you're probably fat.  I will whoop your ass.  I will whoop your ass.  How dare you talk about Puerto Ricans, baby?  Me and Rip will come back with a freaking kick your ass.  You've got nothing against Rick.  He works.  You probably don't, you bum.  You probably drive around with your little Puerto Rican flag hanging off your mirror. 
[93:30]
 I don't have a Puerto Rican flag.  You don't have a car.  You probably have a bicycle.  Why do you put an American flag in your car?  You freaking little bitch.  You freaking greaseball.  You freaking Italian greaseball bastard.  You're a little greaseball.  You're a greaseball.  All right, here's the real racist.  Go and have some macaroni, all right?  Go and cook yourself some macaroni.  Go and have some macaroni.  You got to have that one.  Yeah.  You're the real racist, kid.  You got to start calling me greaseball.  Why? 
[94:00]
 Am I calling you names?  I'm just saying how greaseballs are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yesterday.  Yesterday.  You said it yesterday, you freaking greaseball.  You freaking Goomba.  I said your people go up the cliff.  Goomba.  I'm not saying any lies.  Damn Goomba bastard.  What are you talking about?  We are so doomed as a society because we'll never get along.  It'll never be like Vulcan, where everyone is just logical and gets along.  There will be hatred on this planet forever until we just blow ourselves up or a meteor  hits or we spin into the sun. 
[94:30]
 There will always be hatred on this planet.  That's what amazes me when they get these groups together that try to wipe out the hate,  stop the, silence the violence.  It ain't going to work.  We're animals.  Gary Conrad is the little grease little dagos.  We're animals.  That's all it is.  That's all it boils down to.  Sure, we know how to pull things out of the ground and make buildings out of them and  planes and cars, but the bottom line, we're still animals.  We look at something and hate it and we want to kill it.  Hey, Benny, that's just the way we are. 
[95:00]
 Gary Conrad, the hypnotist is here.  Could you come in so we could hypnotize you to love black people?  I don't think that would ever happen.  You would never love black people because he's a little racist goomba guinea fricking  egg plant parmesan eating Jesus Christ.  I got nothing against black people.  I said that.  I don't hate black people.  I think there's great black people.  I'll tell you what, I wish that guy J.C. Watts would win the presidency or that Alan Keyes.  They'd be two great presidents.  They're called black.  I don't hate black people.  I'm just saying there's something wrong with these people where I don't know if it's a 
[95:30]
 family breakdown where they're filling up the prisons, they're committing a ton of crime  and nobody's talking about it.  Who are the Italians, bro?  Who are the Italians?  What are we talking?  Look at freaking Gotti.  Look at Gotti.  Everyone always points back to Gotti, don't they?  Leave Gotti alone.  Well, I think that guy's a pretty cool guy.  You better say that.  He might be tapping your phone right now.  Be careful.  You better say that.  All right, listen, you guys, we got to fly. 
[96:00]
 All right, man.  Benny, it's always a pleasure.  Okay, so.  Benny's going to be our new morning man, hopefully soon.  I would listen to this every single day of my life.  Benny in the morning.  I'm going to head over to Hedwig OG.  All right, Benny.  Hold on, Rick wants to talk to you.  All right.  Hold on, you call back anytime.  Thanks, fellas.  He gets the phones going, Anthony.  Benny in the morning.  Well, we pretty much did that bit yesterday.  Yeah.  You want our new lineup?  I'll promo, Anthony.  Yeah, let's hear it.  No, it's funny. 
[96:30]
 Why?  We told everyone that we have a new morning show and it's going to be Anal Radio all morning  long.  Yeah.  A bunch of people on the email before the show today.  Hey, man, I was excited to tune in the brand new morning show and check out Anal Radio  and instead I hear two schmucks this morning.  Oh, come on.  All right, we'll be back.  Gary Conrad's here, so we're going to get some people hypnotized.  A couple of people on the line here that want to talk about seeing their parents have sex.  You guys stay right there, Mike and Chuck.  I don't know if anyone will be kids. 
[97:00]
 That was pretty funny.  We got to replay that.  Hey, funny kid.  We got to get that right back on the air.  That was very funny.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  All the emails in the afternoon.  Anal Radio Morning.  On 1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker II, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, yeah.  You packed on some pounds for the holidays, didn't you?  Everybody, that winter weather, I'll say you can bundle up.  You're not as conscious about your gut.  This winter sucks.  Yeah.  It got cold all of a sudden, and now it won't go away. 
[97:30]
 This is like the first winter in what, three years?  It's close.  Very cold January, and now it's still cold.  But you're bundled up.  You're not noticing that you're packed on a few pounds.  Hey, the Groundhog saw a shadow today.  Did it?  It saw a shadow.  It did?  Six more weeks of winter, Anthony.  I didn't even know it was Groundhog Day, although I watched Groundhog Day on the TV, because  they play that 24 hours a day.  Because they play that 24 hours a day every day on TVS for some reason.  I love that movie. 
[98:00]
 Yeah, very much.  Why don't we have Spaz in a Groundhog outfit popping out of a pothole?  I'm sure there was one station in this town that did that stupid bit.  The Groundhog?  We're going to have one of our own staff dressed as a Groundhog popping out of a pothole.  I'm sure someone did something on that today.  Well, we're going to have a cab driver come out of a manhole cover, see if he sees a shadow. 
[98:30]
 That's how we decide if there's going to be a longer winter.  Because we're wacky.  That's funny.  All right, and stack it to the World's Fastest.  A lot of people also gain weight from the Super Bowl, you know?  Yeah.  You're picking out like crazy.  Big heroes and stuff.  You've got to burn the weight off.  What are you going to do?  I ask you.  You're going to pop some Stacker II.  Stacker II, World's Strongest Fat Burner, burns the fat.  Also, what else does it do?  It gives you a boost to energy if you're feeling sluggish during the day. 
[99:00]
 And then it cuts the cravings to a snack.  Boy, I almost forgot that.  Very good.  Yeah.  Well, you don't need to know this stuff.  You're a slim guy.  Yes.  You're trying to help out our fat friends out there.  I can't afford to get fat either, Opie.  Why?  Because I don't have many clothes.  I'd have to go out and buy new clothes.  I can't do.  Okay.  Stacker II, World's Strongest Fat Burner.  They have a website, www.stacker2.com.  Stacker2.com.  Or give them a call, 1-800-LIGHTLINE. 
[99:30]
 That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker II, World's Strongest Fat Burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  1-027-WNEW, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Gary Conrad waiting to come on in.  We got Kalbel Bill in the studio helping us out,  giving us a lot of energy today.  We appreciate that, Bill.  Ant and I are sick of looking at each other.  Thank you for breaking it up. 
[100:00]
 Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  There's a bunch of people on the line, Anthony,  that caught their parents having sex.  Yeah, kind of disgusting.  We can kind of go with this for a little while  and see what happens.  Melissa, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  Well, I have a really, really terrible story to tell you.  What happened was I was in a car accident.  It was like around 2 in the morning.  You know, I went to the E.R., got stitches on my forehead,  and so on. 
[100:30]
 So I'm getting home, and I'm really scared,  so I want to talk to my parents.  So I go up, you know, up the stairs to their bedroom,  and I walked in on them, and my mom was giving my dad a hug.  And when she saw the stitches and the blood,  she just stopped and said, oh my God, what happened to my dad?  You know, it's like they acted like I didn't walk in  and didn't see anything.  So it was kind of embarrassing.  I don't know if it was more shocking because of my accident  or because I actually saw them, you know,  doing what they were doing.  So your dad was just kind of hanging there.  Yeah, your dad's junk was right there for you to see 
[101:00]
 and everything.  Well, not really, but you know, I mean, she had it in her mouth.  Oh!  And then she just stopped and said, oh my God,  what happened if you were trying to, you know, caress my face?  And I was like, oh, Mom, please.  Yeah.  Oh, touching your face, and God only knows what her hands are on.  Yeah, she didn't try to...  Well, I know what they were on.  I saw it.  She didn't try to kiss you, did she?  She didn't try to kiss you to make your boo-boo better, did she?  Well, she just, you know, she just grabbed my face 
[101:30]
 and was trying to look at my forehead and the cut,  and she just kind of hugged me.  Wow, she was...  My dad just turned around,  and I guess he put it away or whatever.  I don't know, it was really embarrassing.  Melissa, your mom went from one head to another.  Yeah, I guess you could say that.  All right, timing's everything.  That would have worked much better.  Ten seconds to go.  Thank you.  Well, that's a good story, Melissa.  All righty.  Are you embarrassed?  You guys talk.  Hey, are you embarrassed for your father?  Excuse me?  Are you embarrassed for your father, if you know what I mean? 
[102:00]
 No.  Like, you know, was it like anything you have ever seen in your day?  Well, I didn't want to look too much.  I was just, you know, shocked that my mom was coming at me  because nothing happened.  Come on.  You looked.  Your dad wasn't coming at you.  You looked.  How did your dad, you know, measure up?  Oh, God, that's my dad.  I know, but you definitely looked.  You looked, now you know.  Yeah.  All right, and, you know, what was the first look?  I guess I could say my mom's a lucky woman.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[102:30]
 Okay, this is just wrong.  Yeah, you wanted daddies, didn't you?  No.  You're a filthy whore, Melissa.  I like that.  All right, Melissa.  All right.  Nice talking to you guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks for sharing today.  Where the hell is this show going today?  David, you're next on any W.  Mom, Tom Likers here.  What?  Tom Likers here.  All right, Tom.  I'm just kidding.  I had, it wasn't that embarrassing, but when you invite a friend over for WrestleMania, 
[103:00]
 can I say that on the radio?  Yeah, sure.  Watching WrestleMania, and sure enough, I swore upstair to ask my mom and dad a question,  and I walk in and my dad's got, you know, my mom like all the way.  Can you say the poop shoot?  Easy on that.  Yeah.  Look, so you walked in.  He was violating your mom.  And he was, yeah, he was exploring the balloon knot.  Oh, that's right.  I thought it was something about balloon knot. 
[103:30]
 Yes.  Okay.  Oh my God.  And you walked in on that?  Yeah.  They came out like 20 minutes later, they're like, son, let's have a talk.  I'm like, let's not have a talk.  Have a talk.  Dad, go wash off your area first, man.  You know?  But it was good for dad.  It's good.  It's really good to explore, you know?  You're pretty psyched your dad's getting...  Come on.  All right.  Balloon knot city, baby.  Here's what it sounds like now when your mom farts.  Oh, thanks, boo.  Thanks, David.  All right.  Bye.  So juvenile, Opie.  Chuck.  How are you?  How's it going, eh?

Cowboy.  Sort of not embarrassing for me.  When I was younger, say like 11, 12 years old, we were me and two of my buddies, like  the three amigos in the neighborhood or whatever.  So what we used to do was...  We would bust my own buddies.  We would...  Check there.  I'm just laughing any time anyone calls him Cowboy Bill because he's a drummer and his  cowbell bill.  And Mike, whenever anyone says Cowboy Bill, it's like, hey, man, you're a cowboy.

[108:30]
 Keith's mom is on the line?  Oh no, come on.  No way.  Uh oh.  Keith's mom.  Hey, yes, I'm Keith's mom.  Alright, now Keith was...  You sound a lot like Keith.  Keith was on the air about 15 minutes ago.  He caught you and daddy having sex. 
[109:00]
 Well, the thing is, I mean I was unaware of that, but it reminded me of all... first  of all, they deserve whatever they get because they never leave us alone.  And we try to barricade our room and if that doesn't work, they hear the bed squeak and  they pick a broom handle and bang on the living room ceiling.  It's a cool thing, yes.  And what I wanted to say was it reminded me when I heard him on the radio...  Your voice sounds a little hoarse. 
[109:30]
 Yeah.  I sound hoarse?  I can moan.  Go like this.  I'm nervous.  That's okay.  Anyway, my nephew one time...  The white owl.  The white owl.  No, I don't smoke cigars.  Oh, yeah, sure.  The brand is called Keith's Dad.  What?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Keith's mom.  Anyway, one time my nephew was...  We had a company and my husband wanted to have a matinee.  What we do is we shut the bedroom door and then we open the closet door so it goes against 
[110:00]
 the bedroom door.  Barricade it in a little bit.  Double door.  And then like a final time up there and all of a sudden the kids, I didn't know it, they  were playing hard and seek.  So was your husband.  By the salami.  No, we were...  Yeah, it was not that way.  Seat to me.  Oh my God, listen to that voice.  We're both pretty big people, you know. 
[110:30]
 Oh my God.  Poor Keith saw two fat people having sex.  You know, like is it in?  Listen to her.  Now we know where your son gets his chops from.  I know.  There's one good thing he took care of.  It's a comedic family here.  Okay, go ahead.  So we're up there and all of a sudden the door, my nephew hit the bedroom door so hard 
[111:00]
 that the closet door swung shut, the bedroom door opened and there he was.  Well, my husband, I never saw my husband jump off.  He did like a pirouette in the sky and landed on the floor.  So my nephew, he just went like, sorry.  It's going to make you puke.  No, no.  So he runs out of the room.  So now my husband wants to like spot him.  I was like, no, Dad, I can't.  I can't now.  You know, I forget it.  Wait till later. 
[111:30]
 Oh man, you left him hanging?  Yes.  What a messed up family.  You're having sex.  Your kids get to watch you.  Nephews, nieces.  Whoever the hell wants to open the door.  Hide and seek going on.  You've got company downstairs.  You need to screw upstairs.  It was the worst position ever.  You could have spiked someone.  Uh-oh, what were you doing?  Oh my God.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  If that didn't make it on the air, let's just say, you could say numbers.  69.  Pull the cheese. 
[112:00]
 So I felt like I had to say something to my nephew.  All of a sudden the kid had a hankering for some Arby's roast beef sandwich.  I don't know.  I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.  I just sit downstairs and I point my finger in his face and I just say, I hope you have  nightmares for the rest of your life.  I will from coming off of that finger.  How much does Mom and Dad weigh? 
[112:30]
 I just need to really picture this.  Well, we're very tall.  How much do you weigh?  Well, I'm about two.  All right.  Two bills, huh?  He's about 260.  And you guys are in the 69 position.  Your kids, check that out.  No, I'm my nephew.  Wow.  At least I was facing the other way.  Oh, so the kid got the Bob shot?  No.  No.  You're traumatizing children. 
[113:00]
 It's like a hot air balloon shot.  Hey, was this a nephew?  This is a few years ago.  Was this a nephew?  He just got caught by his girlfriend's father.  The upside down hot air balloon shot.  Oh, my son's yelling at me now.  Anyway, I really like you so, old man.  Yeah, everyone likes yours.  My new best friend who listens every afternoon.  That is so funny.  Is your son there with you right now?  No, he's just in the other room because he's by the radio.  I'm in the den. 
[113:30]
 Oh, yeah.  My husband's sleeping on the couch.  All right, we've got to talk to Keith again.  Get him on the phone.  Okay, hang on.  Oh, my God.  Social services, please get over there and take those children.  We've got to keep going on for two more minutes.  We'll have the address.  Hey, what's up?  Keith, did you hear what she was saying on the radio?  Yeah.  That's pretty embarrassing, huh?  Yeah, I guess so.  So your mom's like a big gal?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  And your dad's pretty nice.  Yeah.  So you're not going to be able to get your kids to the radio?  No, I'm not going to be able to get them to the radio.  I'm going to be able to get them to the radio.  I'm going to be able to get them to the radio.  I'm going to be able to get them to the radio.  I'm going to be able to get them to the radio.  I'm going to be able to get them to the radio.

We're going to need updates, Keith.  All right.  They aren't smoking that wacky tobacco, are they?  I have no idea. 
[116:00]
 Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah?  Do you have pubes yet?  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  You always got to go there, man.  It's the bang on the head this morning.  I'm not thinking right.  Oh, dear.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling back.  We're having your mom call us, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  The Keith family.  The Keith family.  All right.  Stuff going on over there.  Wow. 
[116:30]
 All right.  We've got to move on.  Gary Conrad, the hypnotist is here.  Uh-huh.  Well, we'll get into it next.  If you weren't listening earlier, there's lots to discuss with that.  Okay?  Yeah.  Stay there.  A radio chick special announcement, Anthony.  What?  That's what that promo just said.  I heard she was thinking about wowing us once again today.  Really?  She's all talk.  We love her and all, but she's all talk.  Yeah, I don't think she's going to be wowing anybody. 
[117:00]
 Don't tease us.  Come in and just do it.  Yeah.  It is Whip-a-Mount Wednesday, by the way.  Yes, it is.  Something we'll be bringing back in the spring.  It'll be bigger than ever this year, believe me.  But it's still happening if you want to put wow in your car  and have the girls flash on the way home.  Yeah.  Okay?  Well, you know, if the nice weather's around, you've got your wow on,  and you get wowed.  There you go.  You got any instant feedback there, or anything?  Yeah, I'm looking for it, Opie.  All right.  You know how it is in this computer age. 
[117:30]
 That's okay.  Let me go to Mark first, then.  Mark, what's going on?  Mark?  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're on the air, bro.  What's up?  What's up?  Dude, you should make that kid the new morning show.  Keith should be our new morning show?  Yeah.  I think the whole Keith family.  Yeah.  You've got to get the dad story.  He was sleeping on the couch.  Maybe we should wake him up.  Yeah.  By the way, Keith's got a call back.  We want to get his phone number so we can get updates from him.  All right.  Definitely, dude.  Thank you, Mark. 
[118:00]
 All right.  You've got to talk later.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, Tommy in Jersey.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  I'm going to get you a new phone number.  What are you doing on my granddadda?  Oh, that would scare the crap out of me.  Grey hair flying all over the place. 
[118:30]
 All right, let's get Gary Conrad in here finally.  All right.  Anthony has become a skeptic.  He doesn't believe in hypnosis.  Yes, I am a true skeptic.  Gary was in here a couple months ago and he blew everyone away.  There he is.  Mr. Conrad, back in the studio.  Hello, sir.  Yes, I know you've been listening and hearing what's going on. 
[119:00]
 I am truly a skeptic, complete skeptic.  Mr. Conrad, I want to go on record and say I truly believe in the hypnosis.  I've got to say also I don't know what their motives would be.  I can't give you any explanation as to why I'm so skeptical.  I don't know what their motivation is to do what he did last time, Rick and Spaz, when they were under hypnosis.  But I just cannot believe that you are so powerful that you can get a human being, Rick, to act like an infant in the corner. 
[119:30]
 Yeah, well, you know, in 1491 I thought the world was flat too.  Alright, I'm thinking archaically fine.  We're putting a challenge out to you today.  Oh, really?  I've got a challenge.  I've got to try to make Anthony believe.  I completely believe, Steve completely believes.  You've got to let me plug my show first.  I'm going to be at Rascals Comedy Club West Orange, New Jersey all week. 
[120:00]
 And tomorrow night, and the second show Friday night, we're going to do an erotic show.  Under hypnosis.  And tonight, you're going to be on a worldwide web.  Rascals is starting this thing up.  My wife's in Australia.  She'll be watching it tonight.  They've got to hit like www.com or something like that.  You're not a web boy.  You can tell her.  You don't want people just going to www.  What is www.com?  www.com. 
[120:30]
 Let me see real quick.  See what comes up.  All right.  But you're there all week starting today?  Yeah, they're all week.  And tonight, they're going to have it on a worldwide web.  OK.  So www.com.  Rascals Comedy Club, something like that.  Oh, it does say on air.  Bingo.  Hey, look at that.  Now that.  See, Rick doubted that.  Anthony doubted that, too.  Wait a minute.  I don't know what this is.  We don't know what this is.  Some kind of Millennium Bash website thing, it looks like. 
[121:00]
 It's amazing.  You don't know the real website there, guy?  No, I don't know that.  Maybe rascals.com.  Yeah, I don't know it.  All right.  973736.  Rascals.com.  Rascals.com.  Sorry about that, guys.  That's OK.  Also in the studio today, cowbell Bill, Gary.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're back.  Hello.  How are you?  Good.  Now, so I guess, yeah, and ask him some questions.  Yeah.  When I left here last time, you were such a believer, and you admitted you had an epiphany. 
[121:30]
 Right.  And you did it right on the air.  OK.  And ultimately, I go, I told you.  OK.  I told you.  And you're reading a lot of Humble Crow.  Uh-huh.  I agree.  Without a doubt, because I was listening to it on the way out of here, without a doubt,  this truly happened.  Rick would not be in the corner sitting on the ground looking at a quarter, a shiny quarter  like that for 20 minutes.  And then he-  I agree with you.  I did say that.  But now you're-  But in thinking-  Yeah.  Then you started thinking about it.  When I really started mulling it over, and I was looking at the videotape and kind of 
[122:00]
 a Rick and spaz about it.  And I got to say, they didn't say anything that would lead anyone to believe that they  weren't, in fact, hypnotized.  But I- I don't know.  What about the verbiage that your program director utilized on air, which you're not  supposed to say even at your show?  He was saying like-  He knows we have a half hour of dump time stored up, and any curse words would be thrown  out. 
[122:30]
 I need to do the-  Watch.  See, there we go.  I know he hits the button and it goes away.  Hi, Mom.  Hi, Dad.  I know you're listening.  I hit the heights.  Well, I had asked some of the questions you were talking about before, like robbing banks.  Right.  Now, if you could get people to act like an infant in the corner, couldn't you indeed  hypnotize a bank teller?  Afghanistan, banana stand.  Open up the bank vault or something. 
[123:00]
 Well, maybe.  If they robbed the bank before, you probably could get them to do it again.  All right.  And, I mean, wouldn't there be other ways you could use this talent to-  Sure.  To, I don't know, get yourself rich or- but you're probably doing that by entertaining.  I understand.  The man asks the question, then he answers his own question.  But I mean, other things maybe.  Why don't they hypnotize a- you know, you'll hypnotize a world leader.  All of a sudden we have world peace.  Well, maybe they have. 
[123:30]
 I never went the other way though.  Maybe it wasn't a good hypnotism.  I don't know.  See, I'm just very skeptical.  That's all.  And I want to know, is there- like everyone's saying it would be impossible now because  I'm so skeptical to hypnotize me.  Well, if you followed the directions, you would definitely be hypnotized.  I would definitely be hypnotized.  You would definitely be hypnotized big time because in the back of your mind you can't  get past the fact that Rick was on the ground looking at that corner.  Lurking in the back of your mind is that image. 
[124:00]
 And if you follow them instructions, you're going to go big time.  Now if you halt in the middle of this thing, you know, to take measurements- well, am I  hypnotizing?  Am I not hypnotizing?  Am I more relaxed more now than I was 10 minutes ago?  Will I be more relaxed 10 minutes from now?  Then it's not going to work because we're pulling out.  We're moving already fast and you're just like, wait, wait, wait, we're going to stop  everybody to take these measurements.  We're going pal.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  Do you have a Levoris today?  What do you think? 
[124:30]
 Like what do you think?  I think anybody can be hypnotized.  It's like anybody can bake a cake.  I don't want to.  You keep it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, guess what?  You got a cake going there pal.  Right.  You open that door every five minutes.  Is that yeast rising?  Is that thing going up there?  No, it's going to fall flat.  Not going to work.  You can't be assessing it as you go along.  You just have to let it go.  You're tuition dollars at work.  So what are we going to do here? 
[125:00]
 We got a few people.  We got a few people who want to be hypnotized.  I mean, I'd definitely be willing to go in and really give it a shot.  I mean, if it happens.  I'm glad you say try, but yeah.  We'll work with you, yeah.  Okay.  If it happens, it happens.  If it doesn't, it doesn't.  If you don't follow instructions, we got to help you.  Are you going to throw you out quick?  Are you going to try to get hypnotized?  No, I'm not going to try.  Just go with it.  Here it comes.  I'll be hypnotized.  No, I will follow the instructions.  My prediction is he'll pop out. 
[125:30]
 When he feels it coming on, he's going to slam on a brake.  And I want out.  I'm not ready to have an orgasm.  I said on the radio earlier, I don't think he's going to go under.  I'm just myself a skeptic.  What am I supposed to do?  There are plenty of people.  We got emails up the yimmy.  Phone calls saying, hey, I've seen it.  Totally believe it.  The people that have been hypnotized by you and a lot of your appearances say it is absolutely 
[126:00]
 a fact.  I have nothing to back up my skepticism on, but I am indeed skeptical.  That's all I can say.  All right, so what are we going to do here?  We've got the gauntlet.  Here we go.  We've got Spaz again.  Whoa.  You've got that all-time great dad.  He's our favorite.  I really like him.  We've got a couple of guys out.  Who else we got, Rick?  We've got a few guys that you invited yesterday to come down.  Camera guy wants to do it.  Unofficial Steve might give it a try. 
[126:30]
 I might try.  Don't say tried.  All right.  No, you just got to go with it.  Okay.  All right.  Fine.  You're going to have a lot of people in today, Gary.  You've got Anthony's going to try it, Spaz.  Nobody tries.  We give it a shot.  We give it a shot.  Psycho Mark is giving me a problem.  Psycho Mark can't do it.  I'm too busy with work.  He's scared because he knows he'll do some crazy things on a hypnosis.  He's got to go to work for you.  Because he never does.  He can't answer any questions.  He's afraid he might act like a normal human being on a hypnosis. 
[127:00]
 All right.  How many of those guys out there?  We've got three extra guys out there.  Three extra guys?  We'll just take the best ones.  Yeah, well, that's what happened last time.  All right.  How much time are you going to need, Gary?  I don't know.  It depends on how intelligent they are.  It's going to take a while.  The smarter ones go under quicker.  The sharper ones are more creative and go under quicker.  That's just the way it is.  Oh, look at that.  See that?  Look at that.  We're going to have some trouble here on my life.  I like this challenge.  That's almost a disclaimer. 
[127:30]
 What?  It's almost like a knock to me.  If I don't go under, then I'm not intelligent or sharp.  Well, he's feeling the challenge.  I understand.  He's very protective of his talent.  I have a question for you.  Once you're under, can you snap out of here?  Yes, he can pop out any time.  Sure.  OK.  We had this question earlier.  When Rick was playing with that quarter as a five-year-old in the corner, if also I said,  Rick, fire in the building. 
[128:00]
 We've got to get out of here, would he snap out?  No, you were Uncle Opie at the time.  I know.  Uncle Opie, please get me out of the building.  I'm not even saying like there's a fire.  What if there was a fire in the building and all of a sudden he's left alone as an infant  in the corner?  Would he crawl under a cabinet and dive smoke inhalation like an infant would?  No, I think his survival mechanism would kick in and that happens at any age.  He'd just pow.  All right.  Survival is his number one instinct.  OK.  He'd probably get you out of here.  Probably would.  All right.  Well, let's get... 
[128:30]
 He'd be crawling over every once in a while.  All right.  And I'd have my quarter.  Women and children with the quarter.  Well, let's get this rolling then.  OK.  All right.  We've got Gary Conrad, the hypnotist in the studio.  He was great last time.  He's going to be at Rascals for the rest of the week.  He's going to be at Rascals for show info.  OK?  I'm ready.  All right, Ant, go for it.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  See you later.  We'll take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  All right.  It's the Opium Cowbell Bills show, everyone.  Ant.  Anthony's in the other room with Gary Conrad, the hypnotist.  He's going to get put under, hopefully. 
[129:00]
 And we'll see if Anthony is still a skeptic after the session.  I just don't think he's going to go under, man.  No way.  I don't know.  You know, I don't know how powerful this stuff is, but one thing I can tell you is  I'll know.  OK.  All right.  Yeah, you've known Anthony all your life, Bill?  Yeah.  OK.  I'll be able to tell.  Very good.  Gary Conrad, he'll be appearing at Rascals all this weekend.  We got the real website.  What was it?  www....  Com.  No, it's not.  Rascalscomedy.com, I believe.  All right. 
[129:30]
 There it is.  Rascalscomedyclub.com.  But Gary Conrad, they're all weekend long.  A couple erotic shows thrown in there if you want to call Rascals for all the info.  OK?  We're going to play a couple tunes and see if we can get a little bit of a break.  OK?  All right.  We got Anthony.  There's no way Ant's going under.  And we got Steve from the unofficial website and a couple of our listeners stopped by as  well.  What, Rick?  I don't know.  I think Anthony might actually end up going under.  This would...  Because he said guys who are sharp and creative...  Right.  ...tend to get under pretty quick.  If Ant goes under, it could be some great radio.  Yeah.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio. 
[130:00]
 OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio.  OK.  So, we're going to play a couple of tunes and see if we can get the guys back in the  studio. 
[130:30]
 And our buddy Anthony is in the other studio.  He's hopefully getting hypnotized by Gary Conrad, the hypnotist, that does a great job 
[131:00]
 for our radio show.  I completely believe in this hypnosis.  Anthony, a big time skeptic, he's in there with Spaz and Steve from the Unofficial website  and like three or four of our listeners and we should have him in the studio in 10 or  15 minutes.  What do you guys think?  You think he's going under?  Bill?  I don't know.  I'm looking at the back of his head right now.  I'm trying to like pick up on some signs that it might be working.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to see from here.  Because he's in the middle of hypnotizing these guys as we speak. 
[131:30]
 He looks like a little kid looking at the school tees.  He does, right?  So, hopefully...  I'm keeping my fingers crossed here.  I don't know.  Yeah, we got to try and come up with something that we know he would never do.  Well, I think the listeners know Anthony pretty well at this point.  We need suggestions for Anthony.  If he does come in here, hypnotize, things that Anthony can do.  Stupid things, obviously.  Things he would never do if he wasn't under hypnosis. 
[132:00]
 Right, like I see here, you know, have him act like Spaz and have Spaz act like him.  Well, he does that all the time.  2127571027.  We got a surprise for Spaz though today.  And where's the doll?  Don't pull it out because Spaz might be able to see it from the other end.  Yeah.  Well, Spaz, he's great at this.  Gary Conrad loves Spaz under hypnosis.  He's going to have Spaz have sex with a blow-off doll.  What?  He said fall in love with.  Oh, fall in love with? 
[132:30]
 I don't know if we want to see him have sex with a doll.  That would be pretty funny.  Why not?  I got the video camera ready.  Steve gave it to me.  Okay.  Vin, you're next on the radio show.  What's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, O?  All right.  Oh, it's usually...  How you doing, O and A?  I know, that's why I said O.  That's cool.  Anyway, I predicted Anthony's way too afraid to give anybody control of himself to be hypnotized.  There's no way he's coming back.  I think you just hit it on the head.  I've known him for five and a half years. 
[133:00]
 Bill has known him a lot longer than that.  I just don't think he's going to go with it.  It's a control thing.  He doesn't want to give his mind.  He's got to let himself completely over to the hypnosis.  Right.  And that ain't going to happen.  Anyway, that's my prediction.  All right.  Thank you, Vin.  All right.  Talk to you later, O.  Hey, Rick, run out of the studio.  Gary popped out of the studio.  See how much time he needs.  Make Anthony call.  This is funny.  This could be real funny.  Mark, what's going on? 
[133:30]
 How you doing?  Good.  Make Anthony call his wife back.  Someone wants to get back together with him.  What do you think?  Do you think he's going to do it?  Well, that would prove his...  That would definitely prove it.  You going to give it a try?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think I would lose a radio pal, to be honest with you.  I hear you.  I hear you.  No problem.  Take it easy.  There would be two radio shows in the New York market, the Opie Show and the Anthony  Show.  Right.  And we'd be going at each other's throats.  All right.  Keep the phone calls coming for suggestions of what Gary could get Anthony to do here. 
[134:00]
 212-757-1027.  Gary Conrad performing at Rascals Comedy Club all weekend long, starting tonight.  You can call Rascals for ticket info, okay?  And as we go to break here, a lot of people are requesting the 12-year-old talking about  seeing his parents have sex.  We've got to play this one more time.  And we'll be back.  How many more minutes we need, Rick?  What did he say?  About 10 or 15 minutes.  He just got to know...  He just did the Got to Know You session.  Okay.  He just needed to use the bathroom.  That's what he was going to do.  Oh, really?  But yeah, he's going to start to relax some necks, so probably another 10 or 15 minutes. 
[134:30]
 All right.  Did he tell you anything about Anthony?  No.  He didn't say anything about anybody.  All right.  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  He seems constantly...  Stop jinxing it, Ope.  Ope's dying here.  I'm dying.  I'm not jinxing it.  They can't hear us in there.  You never know.  Somebody might open the door and he'll hear your voice saying, oh, you know, we got to...  Right.  It's like, oh.  This will be amazing radio if he goes on there.  Unbelievable.  You know what we need, though?  Anthony has done a lot of stuff on the air, said a lot of things that he would never, 
[135:00]
 ever do.  If anybody remembers stuff in particular that we could have him do, that would be awesome.  That's a great idea.  We need your help today, guys.  2127571027, we go to break.  Listening to Keith talk about his parents having sex from a little while ago.  It's worth a replay.  Check it out.  Dad, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you were saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs, what?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando?  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God. 
[135:30]
 I try to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on him?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning, he was in the bathroom.  He was in the bathroom.  He was in the bathroom.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened, you just swung the door open?  Opened it.  Was mom taking it from behind?  Oh, my God.  What was happening?  What position were they in, Keith?  Feet over the shoulders.  Wow.  That's the hi-how-you-doing.  Is your dad hung?  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But were they making noise or anything?  No, no.  No?  No. 
[136:00]
 No?  No?  No?  No?  No?  No?  No?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh, God.  Oh, be man, get up. 
[136:30]
 Who are you, Rick today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning.  I'm terrible.  And some glad to see you found Spazz?  The kids quit.  Very good.  Even 12-year-olds can come to Spazz.  Did you enjoy it?  I mean, was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Oh.  Yeah, I guess.  You'll remember that for the rest of your life.  How's your dad tell you about the birds and the bees, yet?  Actually my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question, what hole does it go into? 
[137:00]
 My father said, whatever one's open.  Oh my God!  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one. 
[137:30]
 Oh my God! That's funny.  Keith, you're alright, man. I guess you'll do okay.  Anything else?  I'd rather not say.  You guys suck.  So does your mom, Keith.  Call back anytime, alright?  Alright, there he goes, Keith, everyone.  He's very funny.  Funny little lad. 
[138:00]
 Yes.  Usually I say, hey, hey.  Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff, Bill.  Yes.  Do you notice something? You haven't been here in a while?  Do I notice something? No.  Something different on the Opster?  No.  No glasses?  Oh yes.  I wanted to talk to you about that.  Thank God you don't look at me that closely. 
[138:30]
 You just passed the test.  I had the laser vision correction thing two and a half weeks ago, Bill.  Came into the show and I broke my glasses live in the air.  Don't need them anymore. I got 2015 vision.  I would love to do that.  You got glasses on you.  I would love to do that.  I could drive at night. Everything is crystal clear. It's unbelievable.  Okay.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Philotoff.  He's performed over a thousand of these procedures.  He's been doing it for a very long time. 
[139:00]
 He takes his time. He makes you feel good.  Because I was a nervous wreck to tell you the truth.  He calmed me down and the procedure was like a piece of cake.  Now I got great vision.  Knowing you, I know that you probably did a lot of research on this  and came up with the best guy.  Very good.  Bravo, Bill.  Actually, I researched it for about ten months because I was that freaked about it.  Some of the things they do, it could be scary.  But then you have someone like Dr. Philotoff talk you through it.  And then you're like, oh, that's no big deal at all.  And now I got the great vision. 
[139:30]
 And I want to share it with our listeners.  So check this out.  For Valentine's Day, in honor of Valentine's Day, Diamond Vision would like to give the gift of sight.  That's right, the gift of sight.  Contact Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  He's going to put you in the running for a complimentary vision correction and a free exam.  Not everyone can afford this procedure.  So this is the doctor's way of saying thank you to the Opie and Anthony Show and their fans.  He sounds like the man.  He's a very good guy, very down to earth.  So if you want to be in the running for a free correction, you got to give Diamond Vision a call right now. 
[140:00]
 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  That number, once again, 1-800-984-2020.  And if you need that number, just email me and I'd be happy to give it to you.  OK?  All right.  1-027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're getting very excited.  Looks like Gary Conrad is getting close.  I have no clue if Anthony is getting hypnotized, but it's looking pretty good in there, I got to say.  What do you think, Rick? 
[140:30]
 OK.  From what I've seen, I remember him doing this last time.  It's after he's had us start breathing a certain way and relaxing.  And right now, he's just putting in regular suggestions to get us used to doing stuff.  All right.  Well, how much longer do you think?  Probably another five or ten minute stops.  OK.  Very good.  Anthony, of course, the skeptic.  Gary Conrad is going to attempt to prove him wrong.  I went on record earlier in the show and said, there's no way Anthony is going to go under.  No way.  Because he's not that trusting. 
[141:00]
 I know.  You know, you really got to trust the person that is putting you under.  Did you see that?  He just pulled one guy and pulled him down.  What does that mean?  It's weird.  It could be about five minutes now.  Oh, really?  From what I'm seeing.  All right.  This guy's in there drumming on their knees.  All right.  He's getting close to Ant.  All right.  He's like he's like talking to the guy right next to Ant.  OK.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  He's in front of Anthony.  He's in front of Anthony. 
[141:30]
 We'll be able to tell if maybe he can get the odds are good here.  You know, I remember to right now he's probably here.  He goes, Oh, boy.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  Come on.  He fought it.  Oh, boy. 
[142:00]
 It's a son of a bitch fought it.  Dammit.  Dammit.  Jesus.  And like he went for the move.  He went for the move.  And usually, as you saw with the other guys, oh, man.  Oh, man.  As you saw with the other guys, their necks were like and heads were totally loose and  they were like wobbling, almost like a little guy in the back of the car.  All right.  do that to Aunt and Aunt was like a freaking robot.  We were hoping. He went for the move because he holds you and then he pulls you down and  if you're under hypnosis you go for it. He did that move to you and we're like here it  comes, here it comes, here it comes. All of a sudden we see your head just go, nope and  you just shook it back and forth. I honestly gave it a try the whole thing. I wasn't thinking 
[142:30]
 anything else. I was really trying. I was relaxed. I did everything he said.  Wow, we were so hopeful. It just wasn't working. I mean the other guys  seemed to be under. I don't know, whatever. Did you feel anything in there at all? I mean,  you know. I started thinking of some sex and started  going. That's the problem. You've got to get your  boner. You've got to stop thinking about sex for five 
[143:00]
 minutes and then maybe you would be able to go under here.  I mean what was going on in there? You know, just relaxing everybody, getting  everyone in tune I guess with him and his voice. I don't know what the whole mumbo jumbo  is behind it but he was doing it and you know people are responding. So I don't know.  I wasn't. Were you looking around the room going?  No, I wasn't looking. My eyes were shut. I was completely hoping something would happen 
[143:30]
 when I would just go, oh my God, look I'm hypnotized.  Did you at any point say to yourself what is all this mumbo jumbo?  Yes, I use the word mumbo jumbo as a matter of fact. We had people calling up with some  great suggestions for you. Oh really?  For things you would do under hypnosis. Really?  Have Anthony lick the spaz couch, have Anthony on the Lesbo couch, have Anthony caress a  Ricky Martin picture, have Anthony ask out Psycho Patty, have Anthony lick the spaz couch, 
[144:00]
 have Anthony ride the jet ski.  Even if it does work, it's hypnotism not a gun to my head.  Have Anthony cry over his wife.  Have Anthony tell everyone that he really thinks W. Tom Show is really good.  Well, I do.  Are you sure you're not under hypnosis right now?  No. Oh well. Call the ex and ask her to get back together. 
[144:30]
 Whoa. Jesus Christ.  And we would have known you were hypnotized.  Bill, I was bummed. I was enjoying the opium cowbell Bill show.  Yeah, you got that fun.  I think it's Bill the good guy.  I was on the phone for a few seconds.  Oh yeah? Cool.  He didn't help me out with my live read though.  What did you have to do?  Hey Anthony, diamond vision.  Yeah.  Oh, opium diamond vision. Opium had it done. What did Bill do?  Bill was like,  Yeah, so what? 
[145:00]
 I go,  Diamond vision, I had that the other night at the bar. It looked like I was looking through a kaleidoscope.  I set him up. I go, Bill, you notice anything different about me?  He's like staring for like two minutes. I'm like, help me out here pal.  He goes, no.  That's your cue to say, wow, you're not wearing glasses.  Totally, totally didn't get that.  Dude, I'm just messing with you man.  So are they close enough?  I did fine after that. 
[145:30]
 Yeah, you did very well.  It's nothing in your resume Bill.  He actually played a long ass of that.  Anthony, I think we need to take a quick break because I believe he's about ready to march these people into the studio.  Alright.  We're still going to have fun with Gary Conrad even though Anthony did not go under.  Yeah, sorry.  Like I said, I really tried. They were going to make you kiss Spaz.  No.  Somebody said on the instant feedback.  They're just suggesting things, Ann.  Alright.  Yeah, we're going to have you try the chicken dance.  Which I don't do at weddings or anything else. 
[146:00]
 Alright, let's take a break. Spaz is in there. He's hypnotized again. He's always a lot of fun when he's under hypnosis.  We got Steve from the Unofficial website and I believe, what, how many listeners are in there, Ann?  Three or four I think.  So it'll still be a lot of fun. So stay right there. We'll be back hopefully with Gary Conrad live in the studio with his subjects.  Hey, Anthony. 
[146:30]
 Yes.  There's my pal.  Oh, come on.  Look at Bill getting the heat over here.  But we've been doing it for five and a half years.  And something that, I mean, the Diamond Vision thing is great. Oh, he loves it, took care of his eyes and everything.  Bill hasn't had it so he doesn't know he can't relate to that. I think this though.  You can relate to?  Oh my God, PlayboyStore.com.  Now you're talking.  Now you're talking something Bill can relate to.  There you go.  Valentine's Day. You know that big pig of a woman you took to bed last week?

[149:00]
 We're waiting for Mr. Conrad. Looks like he's just about ready, Anthony.  And with the rest of his subjects?  Yes, he's playing Rascals Comedy Club all weekend long starting tonight.  Call up Rascals for the ticket info. A couple erotic shows in there as well.  Oh. What does he make them do?  I don't know.  The erotic shows.  You can only imagine that.  All right, bend over the chair. Please draw it down.  I wish we had a number for Rascals so you guys could call up for the ticket info. 
[149:30]
 I know they're listening so send it on the Instagram feed back.  He has the number, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, once he gets in there.  He'll plug it.  All right, his subjects have stood up, Anthony.  All right.  Oh my God, look at Spaz. Spaz just fell down. He just walked into the wall, I swear to God.  Spaz is a mess. Jesus Christ.  All right, entering the studio, Gary Conrad, everyone.  All right, he's lining up his subjects, Anthony. 
[150:00]
 Oh my God, look at Spaz. Okay, look at Spaz. All right.  He's got three subjects. Spaz is completely out of it.  Like a zombie. He's like a zombie.  All right, he's putting on the finishing touches of the hypnosis.  Just like slamming up Spaz's face. 
[150:30]
 Get the hell out of here. Come on.  I still don't buy it. No, I don't buy it. No way.  I know.  He's prepping them, I guess.  Spaz's face is hysterical. I got to give him that.  He's a mess. Look at him. 
[151:00]
 That was easy.  It's easier because he's asleep five hours a day during the show.  Feeling good in every way.  I'm a little louder. I'm a little louder.  Hi guys. Mr. Conrad, Gary Conrad in the studio.  Anthony. I apologize. I was really giving it a try.  I said I got a bag with a million dollars cash in it with your name on it, my hotel room. 
[151:30]
 Think of how we would reply if you were to say, oh, I'll try to be there.  I still believe you, Gary.  Rick, you want some of this stuff?  No, I'll give it up for a win.  All right, so we've got three subjects today.  You know the phone number of rascals because a bunch of people have been calling them for that.  973 is the area code. 736-2726. 
[152:00]
 Okay, good. And you're there all weekend starting tonight?  736-2726. We're in West Orange up until Saturday, then Ocean, New Jersey down to show up one show Sunday.  All right. You've got to save Spaz for last, Gary.  I think I'm going to take Spaz on the road with me. I think you're all going to lose him.  I don't know if Rick gave you the note, but February is Black History Month.  We want Spaz to act black.  You want Spaz to be a black man?  Yeah.  All right. Let's keep that in mind.  Okay, well, we'll do that real quick. 
[152:30]
 Can I get some...  I'll go out there and get my black bag that was in there.  Keep it going. Keep it going.  All right, we're going to do something. I want to do something with Spaz.  He's a black guy. He's going to be a teacher.  Steve, move that mic around so we get him on mic.  All right, here we go.  All right, he's got a suitcase.  It's a TV screen.  Filled with stuff, Anthony.  Yeah.  Spaz, on three, your eyes are open. 
[153:00]
 It's February. It's Black History Month.  I'm just putting a little Black History hat on, Anthony.  On three, your eyes are open.  You're giving lessons to everybody on the air about Black History Month.  Only Spaz's eyes open. Everybody else keep humming in internalized.  Spaz, only eyes open on three.  Time for your speech, Dr. Spaz.  Eyes open, people. It's Dr. Spaz.  Yeah, Dr. Spaz.  I'm here today to educate you students on Black History Month. 
[153:30]
 Now, a lot of you have been learning the word bigger all throughout your life.  Now, to me, I'm a well-educated black man, that's why I'm here today,  teaching you about Black History Month.  There is no such word as the word nigger.  Their nigger has been presented by the white folk here in America.  Can we have the good doctor put him away for a minute?  What I'm going to tell you is to educate the deal with these ignorant white folk 
[154:00]
 that use the word nigger.  When they choose the word, use the word nigger.  Now, I know a lot of you out there have been involved in many fights  because of your 200 years of aggression.  The white folk don't want to hear that line anymore.  That line will just get you into trouble.  Now, I'm here to save you from many fights in the future.  Susan Anthony has a question, sir. Susan Anthony.  You have a question, son? 
[154:30]
 Yeah, because you're not going to throw up the air, please.  It's not a question as that.  I'm here to present you with information to save you from trouble, son.  Where'd you get the hat?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, man.  Oh, jeez.  We're still on or?  Yeah, we're still on.  Barry Conrad.  Oh, my God.  Listen up. On three, Pedro. On three, your eyes, Rob.  You're going to come over here. 
[155:00]
 In honor of your lovely noticing, you're going to be James Brown.  You're going to be singing for us, dancing and talking for us.  On three, Pedro James Brown.  On three, Pedro James Brown.  I feel good.  All right, all right.  You're not too bad.  Like Eddie Murphy said, James Brown.  Yeah, I feel good.  I knew that I would.  Yeah, all right, all right.  Come on, baby.  I'm the man.  You thought James Brown was dead? 
[155:30]
 No, no more.  Now you're up.  On three, Pedro, your eyes are much more flamboyant.  All right, open this time.  Hello, everybody.  This is Tom Likus.  And I've been hitting the top with OB-DOP.  Not to suck.  Hello, hello, America.  What about the women, Tom?  Let me tell you something.  This is Likus 101.  They are my friends.  I like them all.  I like them all. 
[156:00]
 I can feel my hips.  I can feel everything in me.  That's Pedro.  John Rocker you're talking about.  When I start snapping, you turn into a Japanese kamikaze pilot.  John Rocker.  One, two, three. Eyes open. John Rocker.  Let me tell you something, everybody.  This is not the regular Rocker you're used to.  I ride the subway and I see these Italians.  What is going on with that race?  Bittoria everywhere.  Everywhere in New York. 
[156:30]
 I live in New Jersey and I sometimes just...  I just back up.  I just back up.  Wow.  I was going home.  I can't wait for him to get back to Spaz.  A little more Spaz, Gary.  A little more Spaz.  Listen, Spaz, your eyes are open.  You're going to feel good. You talked to Ophi and Anthony.  But every time I snap my fingers, you're going to realize you lost another hand at strip poker.  You're just going to remove an item. 
[157:00]
 I snap my fingers twice. Spaz, you do it just like it's nothing.  Everybody else keep your eyes closed.  One, two, three. Eyes open. Spaz.  Now, you were just talking to Anthony over here about the month of February.  Hang on.  Damn.  He's taking his shirt off.  February. He says it's cold or something.  Well, you got a problem with the cold?  Well, yeah, it's pretty cold out if you go outside.  He's taking off his shoes now.  Steve's getting this for the unofficial Ophi and Anthony website. 
[157:30]
 I think he's losing in strip poker, Anthony.  A room full of guys. This is great.  What's wrong with February again?  Well, I just hope it ends real quick.  He's taking his jeans off.  Gary, you've got to go the distance.  I didn't think you were a chicken, Spaz.  You're a chicken. 
[158:00]
 Get over there.  I just said, box his shorts.  I'm like a chicken.  What a frigging tool.  Give us a big crow.  I'm like a wolf. 
[158:30]
 He says box his shorts in the corner.  I hope he's got some chicken feet.  Gary, I'm the one that believes this crap.  Don't make him do this.  That's not the pecker.  He's pecking at him.  Get your pecker away from me. 
[159:00]
 Now Anthony's got some corn.  He's got the prime corn.  Go get the skeptics.  This is in his box, he's running around like a chicken trying to find Anthony.  It's safe to come back.  I have to go.  Where is he? 
[159:30]
 He's in the bell.  Do we have that thing here?  Spaz, you're going to realize you were just a star in a basketball game.  Everybody got changed, but you were a little slower.  I was like, eyes open.  I scored the winning shot.  It's close on.  I told you before the game that we beat there. 
[160:00]
 Listen, on three, Joe, you're Eddie Murphy.  One, two, three.  I love an Eddie.  I love an Eddie Murphy.  Throw down some money.  Bring back my change.  You run down the block as fast as you can. 
[160:30]
 You know he sees you coming because he goes top speed.  In a cone.  Thank you.  Take it away.  I have some ice cream.  You have some ice cream.  Do it in Chinese.  That's the English. 
[161:00]
 You want some ice cream.  Very good. Joe, one of our listeners.  I'm filming all this for the official Opium Anthony website.  Listen, on three, Joe, eyes open. Cowboys got...  He's wearing ladies underwear.  What the heck is with that guy?  What do you call that thing over there? 
[161:30]
 Anthony's got a shorter version on.  How about it?  He's calling the guys fat.  You like him, don't you?  I like it, it's comfy.  He's got a hanging one off his shoulders.  Oh, it feels good.  Look at what you got on. 
[162:00]
 What the hell are you?  He's got a subtle look on his face.  Spaz is like practicing jump shots in the corner.  This is going to be good.  We've got the blow off towel in the studio.  On three, your eyes are open.  Hold that right there for me. 
[162:30]
 On three, your eyes are open.  I'll take a drink.  She can only drink a little.  She's got the hots for you.  You're going to be as calm and suave and debonair as you possibly can be.  Every time I snap my fingers like this, she grabs you some place.  Every time I snap my fingers like that, she grabs you somewhere.  I'll take a little blow off, Tom. 
[163:00]
 She can only hear you when you're talking to her.  She's got a hearing problem.  Can I get you a drink?  We don't know each other that well.  She's coming over, just wanted to get to know you for who you are.  Oh, honey, not the baggage.  You can't get the jewels yet. 
[163:30]
 Just tell me a little bit about yourself.  Where are you from?  Whoa, whoa.  We've got to do the chit chat thing first.  Boy, isn't he smooth.  I hope that 12 year old is listening.  I don't move along like that.  So what's your name? 
[164:00]
 On the count of three, your eyes are open.  You're going to realize you're... Whoa, don't put your head through the window.  On three, your eyes are open. You're going to realize you're Anthony.  That chick is Anthony's girlfriend and you're picking her up.  One, two, three. Eyes open. It's Anthony's chick you got there.  Is Anthony around?  My wife? 
[164:30]
 Anthony's got the little radio showing.  I know you may think I'm just a phone screener now.  I have my points on that show.  I'm sure you've probably heard of me. You know that guy Spadger on the radio?  I'm him.  I don't know.  The show can't keep rolling.  Anthony's got the voices in there. 
[165:00]
 He's a little bit older. He's got some excess baggage.  Excess baggage is between my legs.  You like it this best.  Come on, you don't really want him now, do you?  The ponytail thing is out of hand.  I'm leaving.  Every time I snap my fingers, 
[165:30]
 cowboys had a gas attack.  Eyes open.  Eyes open.  What the heck?  Sorry, guys.  I love Spad.  Jesus Christ, man.  He has a ventilation in this place. 
[166:00]
 I'm a direct viewer.  Did you take my incident?  I thought that was bad, man.  White castling?  I think I'm going to snap my fingers.  Eyes open.  What's going on, Ezra? 
[166:30]
 It's chili's.  What's up with that?  What are you talking about?  I'm just going to snap my fingers.  I'm sure you have.  Let's sit up.  Spad, I'm through your eyes are open.  Every time Opie says 102.7, 
[167:00]
 Spad, you realize you become another month pregnant.  Every time Opie says the term 102.7,  you're going to feel a little kick-ins further up.  By the ninth time he says 102.7,  you're going to lay on the ground and have the baby right here.  Everything else is going to be normal for you.  I'm going to do the eyes open feeling. 
[167:30]
 I didn't know what radio station I was on.  We're 102.7 there, Gary.  Spad, what's the problem?  I think it may be something I ate.  We're trying to do a radio show here.  You're distracting me.  Spad, what's wrong?  Something's kicking in my stomach. 
[168:00]
 We're trying to do a radio show.  102.7, WNEW, it's the Opie and Ezra.  Spad, you're really distracting me.  102.7, 102.7.  He's on the floor.  102.7, 102.7.  You're a doctor. 
[168:30]
 Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Spad just gave birth and now he's making a breastfeed the baby.  It's a rubber chicken.  Rock the baby.  He's got to be the biggest idiot on the face of the Earth.  He's starving. 
[169:00]
 Where's my husband?  Look at that little nipple there.  He's got a great old thing, develops teeth and he bites you there.  Spad's 123.  You're going to get arrested.  He's breastfeeding the chicken.  Rock the baby. 
[169:30]
 Stand up.  Stand up.  Is this your first?  Who does the baby resemble more, you or the other parent?  More like the other parent.  He's not having another one.  What are you going to name it? Junior.  Congratulations Doc. 
[170:00]
 Good job. Stand up.  He's caressing a rubber chicken.  Burp the baby.  More rubber chicken.  Little lullaby to the baby.  Baby does mess all over you Spad.  Baby does mess all over you. 
[170:30]
 I'll take care of it.  No problem.  He's changing a diaper on a rubber chicken.  Mommy wipes himself first.  He's wiping the diarrhea off his chest.  Burp.  Spad's going to be a good parent.  Diaper on it. 
[171:00]
 Good job.  Is he so precious?  Yeah, precious.  Spad's all over us.  Listen, after everybody's eyes open  and you just saw your parents do something that you never thought you would ever see  your parents do it and you want to report it first. 
[171:30]
 We're going to start with Joe. Joe, your parents did something you never thought the idiots would see them do and you're going to tell us about it.  When did they? Eyes open Joe. Now come over here. You were saying about your parents?  I came up from school and I caught them. Wasn't good.  What were they doing? Mom was bent over.  They were having sex. Mom was taken from behind. I never seen that.  It's disgusting. I don't want to talk about it. It's disgusting.  It was gross.  It'll last forever. Did they know you were there? 
[172:00]
 I can't believe I've seen this. Did they see you there? No, I just walked in and caught them in the bathroom.  Pedro, after your eyes were open, one of their eyes opened.  Now what were you saying Pedro about your parents were doing something you thought they would do?  My father's dressed up in a pink bunny suit. My mother feed him carrots.  I'm so fed up with that dude. Wack man. I've never seen anything like that before. It was a Christmas story nightmare.  I'm telling you. Nightmare.  You want to just take your eyes back and stand up. 
[172:30]
 Here comes Spaz again. Do Spaz ever have parents?  Yeah, he's got parents.  Spaz, after your eyes are open, tell us what you saw your parents doing.  You never thought you would see them doing what they wanted to do. I don't know, Spaz.  You were talking about your parents? Oh yeah. This is kind of embarrassing dude.  My parents, I come home one day back when I was going to school in elementary school.  I come home and I see them playing with little dolls.  They're playing with dolls. But the freaky part is 
[173:00]
 that whatever they make the dolls do, they do it themselves.  Really? Yeah. Let's say they make the dolls do some crazy sexual position.  Something crazy gets in their heads.  Or they happen to have Barbie walk over to a bed post and screw a bed post.  Then, I see, I overhear this and see this by the way.  This father tells mom, he said, okay well Barbie screws a bed post.  I got an idea, honey. Go screw the bed post. 
[173:30]
 What my mom do right in front of me, screw the bed post.  Oh my God. Yeah, but freaks me out is that they see me out of the corner of the eye  and continue to do it without telling me to leave. Really?  Stand up, stand up.  Put you back in your toy box.  That's pretty wild. Listen guys on 3 Eyes, you'll be talking to Hope and Anthony  every time I snap my fingers, one of your body parts gets either larger or smaller.  On 3 Eyes, you'll be talking to Hope and Anthony. 
[174:00]
 You'll be talking to them. You'll be talking to them.  You'll be talking to them. You'll be talking to them.  On 3 Eyes, open gang, 1, 2, 3. Eyes open feeling good.  Alright, it's WNAW, it's the Hope and Anthony show.  We got the guys in the studio here. You guys having a good time today?  Wow, what's the problem?  You got a giant foot, man. Check this out. 
[174:30]
 You got a giant foot? Hey, let's see the giant foot, man.  I could kick some serious soccer balls with this thing.  It's huge, man. It's huge.  It's kind of embarrassing.  Well, I wouldn't want this giant foot to hit me in my small...  You got a small penis?  Why are you turning your back?  No reason. No reason. 
[175:00]
 What's wrong with your belly button, Joe?  It's smaller. It's gone.  Joe, on 3, you realize Rick stole your belly button.  One of these days, Rick's got your belly button right now.  Dude, what are you doing? I need that.  I got my belly button, man.  Rick got your belly button. 
[175:30]
 He's right.  Stand asleep, Joe. Stand asleep.  I'm through your eyes, Rope. You realize that Anthony stole your social organ.  One, two, three.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's okay. I'll leave it in your mailbox. You can pick it up later.  All right. Well, now you're a chicken again. Give a new meeting to that term.  One, two, three. You're a chicken again, Joe. 
[176:00]
 Anthony got corn for you. Anthony got that sweet corn for you.  Spaz is running after Anthony. He caught him.  He's stuck back there now.  Okay. They're behind the equipment and Anthony has escaped.  Spaz is like, you're a duck, Spaz.  One, two, three. You're a duck, Spaz.  Spaz is making his way from the... 
[176:30]
 Now you realize you're a disco duck. Stand up and dance.  You're a disco duck. Stand up and dance.  He's doing a disco dance.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  Stand up and take your legs apart.  Very nice.  Spaz is out cold again. 
[177:00]
 Very funny, Gary. Very funny.  Spaz, don't throw your eyes open. You think you had a little accident there and you should have had your diapers on.  You're 99 years old, Spaz.  That prostate just doesn't do it like it used to.  So I threw your eyes open, Spaz. You're 90 years old and you realize you had a little accident.  One, two, three. Hey guys, old man Spaz here. Hey, Spaz.  I think I have to go to the bathroom. 
[177:30]
 I had an accident.  Excuse me, fellas.  Let me ask you one thing, Spaz. Now that you're in your 90s, if you had to do it all over again, what would you have done different?  Probably not be such a prick in my young life.  I'm not a prick in my young life.  Probably not be such a prick in my young life.  What did you do so bad?  Now you know that dry. 
[178:00]
 What about the days on the Opie Anthony show?  How were they? In retrospect? Fine memories.  Were they fulfilling?  Learning experience. Very much learning experience.  What do you think about Anthony?  He's long gone now so you can say that.  Quiet type. He never really said much. 
[178:30]
 Many McDonald's runs. That's what I remember. McDonald's. Going to McDonald's a lot.  What was Opie like in those days?  He gave me a lot of good advice on radio.  What about Rick the producer? He was one of my favorites.  I consider him a bad guy.  He was tough love.  He said Rick gave him a lot of ass.  You're dry now and you can stand and sleep with your legs firm beneath you. 
[179:00]
 Your legs firm beneath you.  Spaz on three, your eyes open. You think you're the Easter Bunny.  You hop around a room one, two, three, eyes open. Spaz, you're the Easter Bunny.  He's got a unique guy.  He's a loaded tank.  Now you realize you're a kangaroo in your shadow box.  You're a kangaroo in your shadow box. 
[179:30]
 He's like the Wicked Kangaroo.  That's some root.  You realize you're Crocodile Hunter from Australia.  Come over here Croc Hunter.  Ain't she a beaut?  There's his vehicle right mate.  Why are we hunting?  A crocodile. 
[180:00]
 You've got to sneak up on a real quiet light.  She's eyeballed you.  You sneak up on her.  You sneak up on her little bugger.  Then you get right through her.  Right through the brain.  I'll be quiet. 
[180:30]
 Freeze Spaz.  I don't want him near me.  Spaz on three your eyes are open.  You think that the top of your foot is a cigarette lighter.  I don't. Take a look.  What's wrong Spaz?  What's going on buddy?  Stand up. 
[181:00]
 Listen up guys. On three your eyes are open.  Your shoes are saying insulting things to you.  Acusatory things to you.  Spazman your eyes are open.  Your shoes say 1-900 things to you.  Eyes open.  Joe come over here. 
[181:30]
 A crazy man over there.  I wish I could do that to you.  Joe where were your shoes?  Paraphrase some of the things in  speakable language.  Call me an anvil.  Who's calling you that?  Shoes. What's the problem? 
[182:00]
 You're nasty man.  Spaz look at your shoes.  Come over here.  Yeah it's hard.  You're going to take it off.  Leave the stockings on.  Leave the stockings on. 
[182:30]
 It appears you're coming off.  I got the oils. Spaz on the count of three whatever your shoes are saying  you're now feeling it.  Whoa.  Feels good.  Come on man.  I didn't need to hear that.  You got the push button I hope. 
[183:00]
 We're dumping out no problem.  You got any callers want them to do anything?  Yeah we do actually.  They wanted Spaz to kiss the doll.  Nah.  Spaz on three your eyes are open.  You've ever come across in your life tell us about it. 
[183:30]
 Eyes open go in there Spaz.  That doll brings back memories.  Put your arm around her.  How do you know that doll?  I got in early.  Sawed it in the corner of the office.  I stuck my tongue in the doll's mouth.  Really? 
[184:00]
 How was she?  The best kisser of any girlfriend I've ever had.  You better not let that get out with some of your dates.  I am dating one person.  Even hypnotized you know.  You better say that.  I feel embarrassed saying that I kissed a blow up doll when my girlfriend would be listening. 
[184:30]
 Will you recommend other people try that?  Anybody in the office.  Best kiss you're ever going to get.  Beats out any human.  It will make your day man.  What do you got to say?  Nothing beats a piece of plastic.  I cleaned it. 
[185:00]
 That's okay.  Want to try later?  That's great.  Keep him away.  Keep him away.  He falls down all over the place.  What are we going to do with Spass? 
[185:30]
 He's done one more for Spass.  Hey Anthony hold this buddy.  Listen up guys.  Every time Anthony tickles that Elmo doll both of you realize that you turn it to tickle me Elmo dolls.  He'll hold that doll with his right hand.  But the minute he puts his left hand on that doll both of you will feel it exactly where it is being.  One two three eyes open gang feeling good.  That's it. 
[186:00]
 It's like a tickle me Elmo right?  Look at that.  That's the size of the head.  That's got to leave a mark when you flick the nose really hard like this.  How about when you punch it in the face like that.  You just like nail it in the face.  Right in the stomach. 
[186:30]
 That had to hurt.  Why don't we ram this thing where the sun doesn't shine.  I can't even describe what's going on.  Steve is getting great video of this.  It's just got to hurt the back of your head.  They are completely on the floor.  Oops.  That's going to hurt. 
[187:00]
 That's going to hurt.  Whatever happens to the guys.  Try to make them stand up.  Wack them across the forehead.  Sleep sleep sleep.  Very good.  What's going on? 
[187:30]
 Three your eyes are open.  Who's the guy you had on?  The one guy is the racist guy and the other guy is the anti-racist.  What did you have on?  Vinny the racist.  Was there another guy coming in that wanted to kick his butt or didn't like him?  Listen up.  Your eyes are open. 
[188:00]
 You are going to interlock your arms.  You are all Siamese twins.  Vinny the racist.  You will be Vinny the racist.  You will be Joe the unracist.  One two three.  Your name is Vinny. 
[188:30]
 What is your moniker?  What do they call you?  We need to articulate.  What's going on?  You are talking to a mic.  They are fighting.  Nice visiting.  Wow. 
[189:00]
 Siamese twins.  Spaz was a racist and the other guy was a black guy.  Oh my God.  I'm going to be at Rascals all weekend long.  Tonight?  Yes.  That phone number for ticket info. 
[189:30]
 973-736-2726.  We will be on the world wide web.  We will be on the world wide web.  We will give the website address after the commercials.  Gary Conrad.  It's always a pleasure.  He is going to be doing a couple erotic shows this weekend.  Call Rascals for ticket info. 
[190:00]
 There he goes.  1027WNEW  Ethiopia Anthony Show.  Gary Conrad for stopping by once again today.  A lot of fun to check out.  He gets that spaz moving doesn't he?  He runs around like a lunatic. 
[190:30]
 He loves the spaz.  He's got some good footage for the unofficial  Opi and Anthony website.  They're filling the gaps.  www.foundrymusic.com  It will take a day or two to get up there but it will be there.  I'll probably make the clips tomorrow and put them up tomorrow all night because during the day it's hard because the site gets pounded so much.  You guys are pounding the unofficial website like crazy. 
[191:00]
 Right after the show people want to see the site they come pounding and pounding.  And the Super Bowl clips are up.  People are enjoying those from the Super Bowl party.  Wow what a day.  Spaz is horrible, high pitched, screaming and hollering.  Like a doll's eyes.  A lot of fun. 
[191:30]
 When he came out of it he was like what is that doll doing here?  Why is my shirt off?  What's the doll doing here?  What did Anthony do?  How do you know? You're not hypnotized.  Oh really? What happened?  What do we learn on the show today?  We have a few calls up there don't we? 
[192:00]
 Yes we do.  And you can quickly do it on the Insta Feedback. We'll try to read as many as possible here.  Alright?  There you go.  Let's get this going.  Hey Peter what's going on?  Today I learned that I am now an uncle. 
[192:30]
 I learned that my brother is a chicken. And that I must hide my rubber doll next time you have to visit.  Thank you Peter.  You sound too smart to be Spaz's brother.  Jimmy what's going on?  I can honestly say you are the best team on NW's team.  You are the only team.  I don't know what to do.  I can't drive them while I keep crashing. 
[193:00]
 What did we learn?  I learned that you guys are the best.  Alright thanks Jimmy.  What's going on?  I've actually learned two things.  The first thing I learned is that if I ever have a kid named Keith I'm getting a deadbolt from my bedroom.  That kid was hilarious today. 
[193:30]
 He's out of his mind.  The second thing I learned is that you guys are talking about driving through Harlem and running lights.  I was down in Orlando this past weekend on business.  And maybe there's a travel tip for everyone else out there.  If you ever see yourself on a street called MLK Boulevard in a strange city,  drive faster.  They don't put Martin Luther King Boulevard in nice neighborhoods.  I pulled up and I stopped at the first light of canton. 
[194:00]
 These guys swarmed out of my car like a bunch of flying monkeys.  Come on dude.  It was better when Chris Rock was doing the bit.  Maggie you're next on the radio show. What did you learn today?  I learned today that if I ever work for you, I am never going to have sex on any of your furniture.  You guys are merciless.  You punished this boy to the point of damage. 
[194:30]
 He's only going to be able to get that chick from this point on.  He's damaged.  Is this a whole parent story?  I wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole.  I know. I'm sitting there going two days. Oh my god.  No one will be up starting tomorrow sometime.  Thank you Maggie. 
[195:00]
 Let's move on to Kooz.  Kooz, you call us all the time now. I recognize the name. What's going on?  I learned on the show to trust Anthony Moore.  It was funny but I don't buy it.  I won't say that it isn't entertaining as all hell.  If you go to a club and he gets a bunch of people up there  and they're doing things like Spazza is doing today, you'd be roaring.  You'll go to Rastle and see the guy you left your ass off. 
[195:30]
 As far as them being under some kind of trance under hypnotism, I'm sorry.  I'm buying it.  I don't know.  I'm buying that something was going on there.  Josh from Manhattan on the News and Feedback.  Today I learned that a 12 year old boy can be more entertaining than any Double D's morning show.  Keith doing mornings. 
[196:00]
 Keith and his family and Vinny the racist,  Would you listen to a show where it's just a 12 year old kid bringing his friends in  and they just talk about 12 year old kid stuff?  I tune in every day. That would be the funniest damn show.  Talking about who's like, oh no, that guy's a dick.  Talking about girls and stuff and how school sucks.  You'd laugh your ass off. Wait, that's our show.  I smell my finger. 
[196:30]
 I'm growing when we hit 15.  You're right, it is this show.  Dave, what's up?  I had an appointment to quit smoking through hypnotism this week.  I don't know what that guy is going to make me dance like a little freak.  I'm not going.  I've got to go find another way. 
[197:00]
 Thank you.  I learned that I would never want to be that rubber chicken.  You guys did the spaz.  I was dying. I almost ran off the road with the jump shot  and the diaper and everything.  I think we got a brand new spaz scream that we have to isolate.  You guys get better and better every single day. I've been listening to you for like 3 months now and it's just awesome.  Keep it up. 
[197:30]
 Syndication now!  Vito!  I'm Joe Soprano's brother.  What I learned today was never to listen to your show  while walking on ice with headphones on. I slipped and busted my ass  when I heard spaz hit the floor doing the pregnancy stuff.  I almost stopped traffic. 
[198:00]
 It would have been worth the trip to the hospital because that stuff was hysterical.  I've been listening to you guys for the last couple of weeks now.  I heard you guys but I can't really listen.  I had the thing that you guys almost got me fired.  I had it kind of low.  What the hell is going on with that word today on this show?  We apologize to our African brothers.  You guys rock, bro. 
[198:30]
 I was talking about the word was.  John from Peekskill, I learned that spaz will make a great mom when he grows up.  We encourage you guys to check out the video at www.foundrymusic.com.  It will be up hopefully within the next 24 hours.  Where are we going? Jim?  What did you learn today?  I learned something. Spaz's secret identity is to have sex on, in and around and with. 
[199:00]
 Turn it off.  Sorry, Jim.  Something about having sex with an inanimate object.  Russ, you're next on the radio show. What did you learn today?  I learned in celebration of Groundhog's Day,  because there's not a day in the week that that brother doesn't see his shadow.  Get off the spaz stuff. Get on Groundhog.  I can stand next to him and not get a tan. 
[199:30]
 Very good.  Let's go to Tony. Tony, what did you learn on the show today?  Did that hit the tip? What is his name? Paul McKenna?  No.  Congratulations on a 2.9, guys.  Thank you, Tony.  2.9. 
[200:00]
 Tony, you're listening.  2.9.  See, we could have dumped out of that.  2.9.  He's listening, though, right?  Hey, Jack, you're next on the radio show. What's up?  Yeah, how you doing? I learned one of the reasons Anthony got new clothes is because his old pants were stinking up the joints.  Wow. No, it got mad at me. I was joking about that. 
[200:30]
 Yeah, and is spaz available for children's parties?  They probably would make a lot of money doing that.  Running around, shucking cheese.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Faster gets us every day. I love that guy.  And I'm trying to listen for his voice now so he can't do it anymore.  It's funny because he didn't use Wrangler today. 
[201:00]
 All these old CV handlers.  One of them was 12.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  How are you?  Pretty good. I learned that Anthony is good at scaling houses and breaking into windows.  I also learned that Keith's mom and dad should put a deadbolt on their door.  That's the biggest lesson of the day.  That kid breaks into the house a little too much. 
[201:30]
 On that note, Joey from Jersey, I learned if I go to the Goodwill in Long Island, I can dress like a DJ.  Absolutely.  Look out for my clothes. I wonder what my fur coat is.  Brian E. from Manhattan. I learned that you can change a diaper on a rubber chicken.  One last one and we'll get out of here.  John, I think you're about it for today. What's up?  What I learned is do any hole that's open. 
[202:00]
 That was the line of the day.  With that, I guess we've got to wrap it up.  Wow.  Well, Cowboy Bill, thanks for stopping by.  Cowboy Bill.  Do people not hear Cow-bell?  Cow-bell Bill.  That's like the Open E and Andy show. 
[202:30]
 I want to talk about the Open E and Andy.  Cowboy Bill Boy.  Always a pleasure when you stop in, Bill.  I guess it's time to power down. This ends the broadcast day here at WETW.  That's right. Saving a little energy, we've got to power down.  Shut that switch.  Pull the lever. 
[203:00]
 Shutting her down.  No reason to keep the station transmitter working after we leave the airways.  That's for sure.  Up next, Kane.  The only problem is you've got to turn your dial though.  Don't even know the guy, but we're going to start promoting him.  You're a great rock and roll.  Some great rock from 92.3K Rock on the way with Kane. 
[203:30]
 It's our show, but you just got to change the station.  It's what we listen to on the way home, you might as well too.  Trust me, nothing to see here.  Move along, people.  Please turn the dial to 92.3 on your FM dial.  Completely serious.  We gave the guy a chance, and he sucks. 
[204:00]
 He can't keep our audience, so we might as well give our audience to someone else and see what they can do with it.  We learned today, Jim from Huntington, that Anthony runs behind the equipment way too much.  I've been a lot lately.  I found a nice niche back there to get away from people.  Stay tuned for Kane. 92.3K Rock, tell him we said hi.  We're giving him our whole audience from now on.  Until something better comes along at 7 o'clock here on... 
[204:30]
 Until we get something we could promote.  That's what we're doing from now on.  We need a lineup promo.  We need that lineup promo.  Notice who's missing. Notice who's not on our website anymore.  Kane next, 92.3K Rock.
