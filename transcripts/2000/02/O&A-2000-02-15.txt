 A gigantic boombox is coming down the street. Hand me the RPG-7.  Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  It is Opie and Anthony. Hello, how are you guys? Thanks for joining us.  All the Mary and Rhoda thing is on tonight, Anthony. Are you going to be watching?  Yes, I'll be in front of my television to watch the Mary Tyler Moore reunion show with Rhoda. 
[00:30]
 They haven't acted together in 23 years.  There are so many unanswered questions from when I watched the last episode of Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda.  Is anyone caring about this? Who's going to go out of their way to watch this?  No one in the country is going to be copyrighted. Is this the song? Are they going to change the words?  This is the old one. They updated it for tonight with Joe Jack.  Mary's daughter's on a boat. She's hobbling knob across New York. 
[01:00]
 Girl, it's time you were all alone. But it's time you started living.  It's time you let someone else do the things.  Bring it on home. 
[01:30]
 It's interesting about this reunion show though. They do it to all our sitcoms that we grew up watching.  Mary Tyler Moore show, that was a sitcom, that was a comedy, right Anthony?  Yes. They bring back the reunion show and they always turn these damn things into dramas.  With the Mary and Rhoda thing, Mary's getting over the death of her congressman husband Anthony.  And Rhoda's getting a divorce from her husband. 
[02:00]
 That sounds like a scream. It's hysterical.  But they do it with all the sitcoms. Remember the Brady Bunch reunion?  The Brady Bunch, very light comedy when we were growing up and stuff. Never got too serious.  The most serious thing, I think Cindy got the sniffles.  And Jan rode her bike without her glasses and crashed into something in the garage.  Don't forget about the smoking episode with Greg.  That was pretty serious, tackling the huge drug issue.  Greg's smoking cigarettes. They're not mine. 
[02:30]
 And then they did the reunion show and what happens? It turns into a drama.  Poor Bobby is now a race car driver and paralyzed from the race car.  That's a joke. Why can't they just stick to the comedy?  Because they have to, you know what it is, they did the been there done that thing.  They're like, oh it was a comedy but we could take these characters that the country has just embraced and tackle the serious issues facing today's youth. 
[03:00]
 Mary's got a daughter in this? Is she a coke whore? That would be a good one.  In a very special Mary. Mary's daughter is a coke whore.  She's hobbing knob in the bathroom at the tunnel to get money for her next jumbo.  Yeah, I bet you Ted Knight's thanking God that he's dead and doesn't have to be in the middle.  God, thank you I'm dead. Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.  Who is alive? Let's see. Mary's still alive. Captain Stooping is still alive. 
[03:30]
 Who's Captain Stooping now? What about Lou? Lou is still alive. I saw him recently. He's so old he doesn't even look like Lou anymore.  Lou, you don't look like yourself. What happened Lou? Ted Baxter with the news. Lou's a big bloated mess.  Lou, Lou, Lou, Mary, Mary, Mary. Well what happened Mary? Mary.  Look at Lou's hairy. Lou, this just in. Ted Baxter with the news. Lou's hairy. 
[04:00]
 Lou, big hairy ass. Lou, Lou, Mary, Mary.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man that's worthwhile is the man that can smile when his shorts are too tight in his seat.  Okay, pookie, Chris in the boat. Lou, Lou, how about a fresca? 
[04:30]
 You'll get nothing in life if you're spalding.  Hey Mr. Knight, what do you think of Mary? She's looking pretty hot these days.  Hot? What size are those boobs? 48 longs? Mary, Mary, how would you like to mow my lawn?  Does weed wacker boobs? I'm your pal. I'm your pal Mary.  Mary News is fine but winning the caddy tournament is what really matters. 
[05:00]
 Lou, Mary, Mary, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou.  Ted Baxter with the news. This question I pose to the audience.  What does Mary Tyler Moore have between her boobs that a young woman doesn't?  What Mr. Knight? A belly button. Mary, Mary, join Dr. Beeper and I.  He's club champion and I'm no slouch myself. 
[05:30]
 Oh my God, very funny.  Oh my God, very funny. Lacey? This is the first time he did his Ted Knight on the show.  Lacey! Lacey Underhalls? She was so hot, wasn't she?  Who's banging Lacey?  I would like to lose for my scratch mark. I love that movie.  I want these shoes cleaned and bumped with a fine chamois. Now get to it, chop chop. 
[06:00]
 Yes sir, yes sir. Why you son of a bitch?  You hear the one about the colored boy, the Jew.  Colored boy? Why you son of a bitch?  I got her in Caddyshack again now.  And he just started talking about that.  I got it from a Negro.  I see one more golfer on the golf course. I'm going to get a new greenskeeper. Is that clear? 
[06:30]
 Mary?  Look at your boobs Mary, what happened?  I'm glad I'm dead. You'll get nothing and like it.  Faulty!  You're no gentleman. Hey, I'm no doorknob either, alright?  You're something, huh honey? You must have been something before electricity. 
[07:00]
 Last time I saw a face like that it had a hook in it.  Oh, I should have said two.  And I never slice.  Faulty and Anthony.  There's no level too low that you guys won't stick to. 
[07:30]
 I have a scanner, I've had one for years.  And yeah, you can pick up cell phones and cordless phones.  And the conversations I've heard over the years, hysterical.  I heard, I was out in the Hamptons once, listening to phone calls.  And a couple of, you know, a gay guy talking on the phone, you know, as they were. 
[08:00]
 Gay guy.  Now they were talking about fisting.  Really? Yeah.  It was hysterical. Sitting there like, listen to this guy, going, you know, I'll bury it up to the elbow.  Whoa! Whoa! Wow!  I heard break-ups, drug deals, affairs.  It was great entertainment. You'd have to sift through all the crap, you know.  I'll be home in an hour, honey.  Oh, great. Good call.  Tell them about the call. We heard that one night. 
[08:30]
 Oh, what up? In the apartment?  Yeah. We're all hanging out drinking at Anthony's place, checking out the scanner.  Yeah. Checking out the scanner, you know, and got a nice strong signal.  Heard some girl talking on the phone.  And she's talking to some guy about how her boyfriend sucks and how she kind of wants to get together with this guy and blah, blah, blah.  So at one point, we're listening to the scanner, but we're also joking around, laughing.  And at one point, I guess we were laughing and I slammed the floor with my foot. 
[09:00]
 Opie stomped on the floor. You know how you do that?  I was laughing so hard, right?  A real knee-slapper type thing.  So all of a sudden, the girl on the phone that we're listening to on the scanner goes,  Oh, people upstairs again banging.  Like, holy jeez, it's that person downstairs.  And then she starts going, oh, it's not the first time they walk around up there like elephants. 
[09:30]
 I think they must weigh 500 pounds.  And then she starts saying, this is me, Jen, Opie, and his girlfriend Sandy sitting there.  I think there was another couple there too, making it more embarrassing.  And we hadn't been on the air long together, so it's not like we had a friendship, really a good friendship.  You're still getting to know each other.  Yeah, still getting to know each other. This goes way back. Go ahead.  So then she's like, and their bedroom is right over mine.  So all I'm hearing at night is, ah, ah, ah, ah, boom, boom, boom, the bed. Ah, ah, ah. 
[10:00]
 I just heard Beat Rad. I'm looking, Opie's laughing his ass off.  All night long. Ah, ah, ah, ah.  It's disgusting.  Right. Oh, well, maybe it's not downstairs.  But it was downstairs. 
[10:30]
 It was, because then we started effing with her.  Because then we decided to play interactive phone call.  Phone call.  I believe it was Halloween night.  So she was kind of scared to be alone. She was talking to the sky.  Well, and I mean, your apartment complex, pretty much everyone was scared to be alone on Halloween night.  Oh my God. But when you look outside and you see somebody just bagged a zebra and dragging it back into their lean tube, I was in a bad neighborhood, man.  When it would rain, I swear to you. 
[11:00]
 When it rained?  It was the highlight of the day for the six billion little children that lived there because they could play in the pothole puddles.  It was like a little pool for them.  I was just waiting for one of them to go to the shores of one of the puddles and have a croc come and grab them.  Drag them in. I swear to this neighborhood.  There was, there were people, it was an apartment building.  Right. 
[11:30]
 Outside of the little porch of your apartment, someone had fenced off a whole area, planted grass, and was raising chickens.  I swear to you.  It was the community property.  Yeah, it was, like you took up three people's backyards because no one had a yard.  You had a cement patio with a wrought iron fence around it.  That's your yard.  This guy decides, you know, I'm going to make a fence.  I'm going to make a fence and raise a chicken just like I did back in Puerto Rico. 
[12:00]
 And they would fence off the area. Beautiful lawn.  I mean, he had it well kept.  Raising chickens.  So freaking funny.  A frightening neighborhood.  The second I moved in, like what floor do you want to stay? What's the top one?  I want the high ground. Love the high ground.  Every night the police were there.  There was something going on. Some domestic dispute going on. Someone's head was going through a wall.  It was wonderful.  So we listened to the lady downstairs on the scanner. 
[12:30]
 So she's kind of scared and she's talking to this guy.  So we decide to go out onto the porch, which is right above her porch, three high, and throw things at her sliding glass door from our porch.  So we take a little piece of candy and stuff and lean it over, winging it.  So we hear it hit the door and hear her go, my God, what was that?  It was just so much fun because we're listening to the conversation and controlling what she's saying.  Then we decide we were going to ring her buzzer and run. 
[13:00]
 So it was down on the first floor. I'm on the third floor.  So Opie goes downstairs to the buzzer.  And after coaxing him for a half hour, come on, you got to do it, you got to do it, buzzes it.  I hear him start running up the stairs. You can hear it on the phone. On the phone.  And then I just hear this horrible, he tripped going up the stairs.  Some getaway.  Because she was on the second floor, so we had to run past her floor to get back upstairs before she opened the door.  Because we were paranoid, convinced that if she opened up her door and I'm just casually walking like I'm there visiting you, that she was going to bust us. 
[13:30]
 And it turns out, the whole end to this whole thing is we got the guy late.  Because she got so scared at what was going on, she said, you better come over here.  He's like, oh really? She's like, yeah, I'm very scared.  Well, it's important to the story. The guy talking to this lady was trying to pick her up the whole time.  And she's like, no, no, kind of give him the brush off.  My boyfriend's driving by.  We got her so freaked out by the end of the conversation. Yeah, she invited him over for the night. 
[14:00]
 Scanners are fun though, man. They just have a blast with those things.  That's a great story.  We forgot all about that.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Kevlar kind of day. 1027 WNEW.  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here. 
[14:30]
 That has no place on this show.  Opie and Anthony. More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, I almost didn't make it in.  What do you mean you didn't almost make it in?  Very close. Well, I was on my way in.  Again? Again? I know. I'm like Rodney King these days.  Jesus, you're way in the lead. We used to have a competition to see who could get pulled over the most.  Yeah, but as far as getting tickets, you're still in the lead.  I talked my way out of it.  I just don't drive anymore, so I'm saving myself a lot of money. 
[15:00]
 I'm driving down Broadway in a black car. The light in the windshield pulls me over.  Pull the truck over. Pull the truck over.  How close to work were you?  Very close.  Like a block or two?  Why do we always get pulled over right around our neighborhood?  I was going to stop at the bank real quick and do some banking.  I wasn't even going to double park.  I was waiting for one of the cars to leave so I wouldn't have to double park while I went into the bank. 
[15:30]
 I was sitting there.  That bone sucker! That sucker!  I'm like, what did I do?  He says you've got to brake light out.  I guess I did. I didn't know.  I'm very grateful if an officer points that out to me.  What a kiss ass.  Shut up. I could have been in jail. Shut up.  I could have used the day off.  We have a new policy. One of us is sick or in jail. The other guy doesn't have to work. 
[16:00]
 Do you know what the hell would happen if I was in jail?  And the listeners find out the barrage of abuse I get?  Forget about it, man.  Bubba would love you in jail, too.  I don't think I'd be going to that jail. I don't think they send you to that jail.  Don't worry. I'll mix up, you're saying.  Before you know it, I'm the queen of the weight room prom.  I get pulled over.  Brake lights out. Sure. 
[16:30]
 Give them my license, which is still a mass license.  Jesus Christ, I've got to get this straightened out.  With mass plates, too, right? Yeah.  He says that's another reason they pull people over.  You get an out-of-state plate here in the city.  You figure you're out of state to get new plates because you've got a problem here in New York.  So they run my license. He comes back.  You've got a suspended license.  Like what? I pay my tickets.  I know you hear that all the time, but I paid my tickets. 
[17:00]
 It's not December, you've got a ticket and a suspended license.  Okay, very funny, Opie.  So, you guys are really funny.  So I said I paid it because, no, I didn't pay it.  You're going to have to come with us down to the precinct.  I'm like, oh no, I'm going to jail.  Oh no, this isn't happening. 
[17:30]
 Wait a minute, I almost got away from those chicks when they tried to handcuff us here in the studio.  Maybe I could get away from these two big guys.  And I'm looking at two uniformed guys on the sidewalk.  I'm like, if I make a run for it, I could probably disappear into Times Square.  They'd never find me.  I'd be face first before I even passed my wheel well.  I'd be like, in the pavement.  Why are you wearing a white beater T-shirt today in the studio?  I didn't do nothing.  You didn't see any kiddie pulls on the streets of Manhattan to hide under? 
[18:00]
 F you!  Should I hit? I should have ran.  I'd be in the police car, the backseat handcuff banging my head against the window trying to get out.  Yeah, you effing cops, man!  I've got to go to work.  I've got to go to work.  But then I have to play the card.  At that point, it's like it's not just getting out of ticket.  I'm going to jail.  So I go, I can't go to jails now. 
[18:30]
 I'm on the air in a half hour.  I'm on the air on the Oprah and Anthony show on the air radio, N.E.W.  Thank God one of the guys knew who I was.  Yeah, yeah.  I know those guys.  Yeah, well.  So they say, well, I got to get, they quizzed me a little bit about my license, date of birth, where I went.  I guess they were from the island because they were quizzing me about Huntington, what school I went to, what year, blah, blah, blah, everything, the whole thing. 
[19:00]
 He goes, all right, well, you better get this taken care of.  You know, some guy might pull you over and really arrest you.  He's like, oh, thank you. Thank you.  But he goes, you better mention this on the air at two o'clock because if you, if this isn't you, because they didn't know.  He goes, how could he prove that it's you?  You know, what am I supposed to do? Go break into my Dyson presence?  Hey officer, huh?  You should have done some of your voice. 
[19:30]
 All right, you pulled me over, huh?  What's the matter, slow day?  Where's the crack heads? All right.  Yeah, I didn't want to get into that.  But, uh, oh, mucho apreciado, officer.  And then I find out because I come to the station and I try to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.  Smart guy.  I call up motor vehicle, they punch up the ticket.  You actually got through?  Yeah, I know.  That's a miracle in itself. 
[20:00]
 They punch up the ticket.  It was that seatbelt ticket I got in December, remember?  That we talked about. Sure.  I paid the $45 that it said to pay.  $55.  For 10 bucks, I'm ready to get hauled in.  So now I got to go to motor vehicle and pay the $10 that are left.  But probably now it's $110 because I didn't pay it.  But, uh, and now I can't drive.  I can't drive until I get this taken care of. 
[20:30]
 Oh, yeah.  If I get pulled over, I'm screwed and I got a brake line out.  I might as well just down a 50 jack on my way home, too.  You're like, you're not driving home to Brooklyn tonight. Who are you kidding?  Dude, thank God they didn't see the kilo of coke in the back.  Shut up.  Oh, my God. It was like right underneath the carpet in the back.  Kilo of blow.  And the dead hooker beneath the back seat.  Well, the shovel should have gave us gave that away.  I was kicking it away with my foot. You could smell dead hooker on the whole vehicle. 
[21:00]
 I was amazed.  You got to get the secret compartments like the rap guys.  I need the trap. The trap.  The trap like Puffy. It needs a trap.  And you know me, you know, the way I look and stuff.  I'm reaching for my glove compartment to get the Reggie and I got like both hands up.  Hello. Not going for a weapon.  Don't worry. Watch. I could take my wallet out without my hands.  So we got to thank New York's finest.  Yeah, thanks guys. That was pretty cool. You know, they could have brought me in and stuff. 
[21:30]
 Because if it wasn't for them, we would not have a radio show today. That's the truth.  No. Yeah.  God, I would have laughed my balls off if at 2 20 when we had to go on the air.  I'd call up.  You'd call up from like to join your one phone call.  I know. Wouldn't that be great?  Um, Alpie? Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. What's up?  Not much. Um, you want me to check your stocks for you?  No, no. Um, you usually call this time to check your stocks.  Oh, I'm in jail. I got locked up. 
[22:00]
 But, uh, woof. All right. I dodged the bullet.  Must have felt like old dirty.  This is, this is debauchery mania.  Prostate exam for everyone.  One one one one two seven WNEW.  Alpie and Anthony, in my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  What the hell is that? 
[22:30]
 That's the dude from the Simpson.  How cool is that?  Gotta thank, uh, gotta thank Psycho Mark and Jimmy.  Uh, that's Paul, right?  Cast-uh, I wanna say Castellano.  No, Dan, Dan Castellano.  I'm thinking like, like cartoons and, and mob figures.  Yeah. Well, you know the deal.  The guy that has like half the voices on the Simpsons was in here today.  Psycho Mark and Jimmy, uh,  totally taking care of the radio show for once.  Nice. 
[23:00]
 Got him to cut some, uh, some nice liners for our radio show.  What other ones we got?  Oh, you wanna hear all of them?  I haven't heard them yet.  Alright. I wanna hear them.  Let me get in here.  What's this music in the background?  Yeah.  It's a little weird.  This is a little too disco-y for me.  Yeah.  Sounds like we ought to be a carer.  Alright, hold on. Let me get rid of this stupid music bed.  Thank you. 
[23:30]
 I don't know if I like that one.  Alright, here's our Simpsons, Simpsons liners.  Hey kids.  It's your old pal Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy,  I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show.  Syndication now.  Wait, he'll say anything, huh?  Who cares, man? It's great.  Alright, we got that one.  We got this one.  Mayor Quimby.  Good day, New York.  I, Mayor Quimby, would like to be your senator. 
[24:00]
 If elected, I would use your tax dollars to put Opie and Anthony on radio stations across this great land.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  That's great.  What else we got here?  We got Homer.  Whiff him up, Wednesday. Woohoo!  That's you.  Homer.  We have another Homer. 
[24:30]
 That Tuesday, Hummer Club, I'll be sure to bring my kazoo.  Bring it, Homer. That's great.  Oh, man.  This just made my day.  One more here.  Opie and Anthony, those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  That's pretty cool.  Got to thank Psycho Mark, man. Good job.  Thank you, Mark.  And Jimmy. I said Jimmy, too. 
[25:00]
 Awesome.  So, what's up, Anthony?  Oh, man. How was your little weekend?  We weren't here yesterday, were we?  No, we were not. We finally took a day.  Yeah.  Very relaxing day.  Very nice. I stayed in the city.  Did you?  Yeah. I've been here since Sunday afternoon.  Wow. It's been a freaking fortune, man.  Yeah, it's not cheap staying in New York, man.  That's what you got to do after you check out strippers all night long 
[25:30]
 and you want to make good with your woman.  I wasn't going to touch on that subject.  Well, everyone else is touching on it on the email and the instant feedback.  Call me a pussy. That's what I had to do.  I guess a lot of people are curious as to what happened Valentine's Day.  It seems there was a little rift in the Opie-Sandy relationship  when we last checked in with you guys.  Last week, you had gone to the booby bar.  Privilege, right? 
[26:00]
 And I don't know, the way you were talking about it, you got a little upset.  It was a hangup on the phone and that's the last I heard.  So, you had a good Valentine's Day?  I had, to be totally honest with you, the best Valentine's Day.  Really? Yeah, I'm not going to lie.  I can't really make a radio bit here. I just had a really good time.  Oh, cool. It cost me a fortune, like I said.  But I figured I had to step up.  Step up.  Once again, avoiding the whole engagement ring thing.  Very good. What did you do this year? 
[26:30]
 Well, you block the thoughts out of the head when you start throwing nice hotel rooms at them.  Right.  All day massage, you know.  Oh, really?  All these things you can do to get out of that.  Did she go to the spa?  Well, she will now. I got the certificate, like I said I was doing, for Maximus.  Maximus Day Spa. Where? Westbury, right?  Karl Place. Karl Place?  Nice. So, I got that, the hotel rooms.  She surprised me, though. 
[27:00]
 What? It takes a lot to surprise me, especially in a relationship.  Yeah.  I'm usually happy, but it's nice to get a surprise.  And she had a little envelope. I opened it up.  Tickets to see Beck last night.  Hey, look at that.  I don't know if many people know about my music taste, but Beck is one of my favorites.  Yeah, by far. New albums, great. Otelay, in my opinion, the best album to come out in the 90s.  So where was he?  Radio City Music Hall. 
[27:30]
 Bunch of freaks, though, man.  I'm starting to get out of touch, I think.  Because we consider ourselves hip, right?  No. We don't have it going on.  I wouldn't sit there and call me and say I'm Mr. Hipness.  Well, we try. We try, you know, to stay on that level.  Try to at least stay in touch with what's going on.  Oh, man. I went to the Beck show last night at Radio City Music Hall.  Yeah.  A freak show. We are on freak shows.  The styles. Styles I would never be caught wearing, even on Halloween. 
[28:00]
 Oh, yeah, I don't know.  That's the younger generation, I'll think.  Well, that's what I'm starting to realize.  We're losing touch in our 30s.  There's like a generation gap happening there.  Sure.  You know?  That's her head.  But no, Beck was unbelievable last night.  Awesome. I saw Sean Lennon there.  Oh, yeah?  Five feet away from the guy.  Looks exactly like John with Asian features. 
[28:30]
 With the Yoko thing thrown in there.  Yeah. It was cool seeing him.  Should have asked how Yoko was.  Yeah.  They get along really, really well these days, don't they?  I was going to yell duck.  God damn it.  That's awful.  Oh, Jesus Christ. What the hell is that?  So how was your weekend, Anthony?  Great. Yeah?  I had a great weekend. A lot of fun.  So that's Anthony's life. Fun. 
[29:00]
 Fun, fun, fun.  What did you do for Valentine's Day?  Check this out, ladies and gentlemen.  Well, first, of course, Sunday night, I had a pisser at the J. Moore Show.  That rascal.  Yeah, we got to talk about that today as well.  I think J. Moore is coming in today.  Really?  Yeah, because he wants to recap the whole weekend.  That's cool.  And we got Buddy Hackett's number.  Yeah.  All right. Well, you want to talk about the J. Moore Show as well here?  Well, little bell, just talk about what I did. 
[29:30]
 Okay, good.  So, the J. Moore Show, we had a couple of rascals.  Man, did they hook us up.  Huh. Huh.  You're a pisser, man.  The limo's out back, parked out back.  We go to walk out and stuff.  Me and Opi, they gave us two limos.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Because it's like, I am so not used to that kind of treatment.  And we usually go together.  We're like John and Paul now from The Beatles.  We're getting our central limos and stuff.  Get away from me, Paul.  Yeah, so we don't get limos often. 
[30:00]
 That's the truth.  No, it was cool.  And it was kind of a truck, kind of a long trip.  So it was nice to have the limo in the back and stuff.  And leaving the club after a great time.  Did you have the listeners waiting outside in the rain for you too?  Yeah, it was kind of cool.  Signed a few things, a couple of pictures, you know.  And then I'm like, look guys, you can only sign a few here.  I've got to go.  Rushed off into the limo.  And then I'm like, I'm a couple. 
[30:30]
 That's it.  I'm only good for a couple tonight.  No, the only reason I said that is because there were two people out there.  I had some of that good limo sex.  Did you really?  Oh, partition went right up.  That's dangerous, man.  No, it's fun.  Windows all steamed up.  You know what that does to the limo?  It got to the house.  The limo driver has to like crack the door a little at the back because he's not sure what's going on back there.  Because he knows what's going on there.  Oh, they could feel every pounding in the front seat. 
[31:00]
 That was good.  Had a good Valentine's Day, went shopping.  That was Valentine's Day.  Got a foosball table.  Not kidding.  My buddy Anthony is turning into Kevin Spacey in American Beauty.  What?  You've traded in the old model for a new model.  Oh my God.  You traded in the knickknacks for foosball tables and large screen TVs.  You've got the biggest bed known to man now, ever. 
[31:30]
 We've got to call the Guinness Book of World Records because I'm convinced you have the biggest bed in the entire world.  And it's not only big, it's very thick.  The thing is like 15 inches thick.  It's a sick mattress.  And that's just the mattress.  You're just like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty.  I need like a step stool to get up in the bed.  You've got a foosball table for Valentine's Day.  Foosball table.  Dude, great.  That's hilarious. 
[32:00]
 Placing foosball.  Why not?  Yeah.  And I can't wait for you to throw your first like little party over there.  Toys.  That's the key.  Toys.  All right, Kevin Spacey.  You can trade in your radio job to work like the drive-thru.  Don't be silly.  I want a foosball table.  Please.  I love foosball.  I used to play all the time down there.  It was a people's pub down there in East Northport. 
[32:30]
 I played all the time.  And I always said, you know, I would love, dream would be to have a foosball table.  Why didn't you get one the last 10 years?  Well, I'll be a foosball table that doesn't quite go with the motif.  The rest of the house, I wouldn't think.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  You're digressing.  Is that it?  Well, from what I am accustomed of seeing you, the environment I'm accustomed to seeing you in.  Oh, yeah, you're digressing. 
[33:00]
 Yeah, it's fun.  Your old house had nothing that was related to you in it.  The computer.  There was a computer, but everything else was knickknacks and...  Right, pottery and knickknacks and little things to make the place look knickknacky.  Right.  Nice.  And now your new place, you've got pretty much a...  Toys.  A sex bed, a large screen TV and a foosball table.  Computer room. 
[33:30]
 And a computer room.  And let's see, big TV.  Oh, PlayStation games strewn about the place.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, videos, computer games.  And yes, when it gets delivered, because I don't have it yet, but two weeks.  Get delivered.  And then when it gets delivered, the foosball table is going where normally there would be a dining room table.  But since there's no eating like in the traditional sense, you need the foosball table. 
[34:00]
 So basically you've got like the Joey and Chandler pad.  Yeah.  From friends.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  The Joey and Chandler pad.  You have the big recliner too?  Yeah, a little sectional couch with two recliners.  And a thing that folds out so you can put your drinks on?  No, I don't have that.  Got some kind of wacky table though for the sectional couch.  It's shaped like a pie wedge so it fits in the sectional thing.  And the whole top of the table comes up and towards the couch if you're eating off of it. 
[34:30]
 Since you can't even eat in the dining room because there's a foosball table there.  That's great.  It's kick ass.  That rocks.  It would be the pride of any 15 year old.  I swear to God.  Where's the pinball machine?  Hey Lou, what's going on?  How are you Lou?  Anthony had a little fun at a limo, huh?  Yeah, he had a share with everyone that he had limo sex on the way home from Nebraska.  You said you put the partition up. 
[35:00]
 One thing you might not know, I drive for a living.  There's also an intercom.  Oh yeah.  You know about that?  Yeah, I don't care.  You want to listen?  I don't care.  I don't care if he's holding a straight line.  I don't care what he does.  Alright, I'll let you in on that.  Not too many people know about that.  They put the partition up, they start going at it, you feel it up front, the intercom goes on, you hear everything.  Wow.  Just fill you in on that. 
[35:30]
 I didn't know you knew.  Thank you Lou.  Alright, take care guys.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, you're next on WNEW.  Hey guys, how are you doing?  I'm doing great.  You know, it's been a long time since college.  Sometimes you go into the house, they let you spin.  There's no spinning.  There's no spinning.  There's no spinning in foosball.  Hold on.  Cute chicks can spin.  Okay.  See, I'll tell you. 
[36:00]
 You're face to face with a guy at the foosball table, he spins it, you call him a pussy and grab your beer and walk away.  There's no spinning.  Especially if he's winning at the time.  There's no spinning.  Isn't that great?  You're playing foosball, you calculate, you know all your cool moves and everything, and the guy at the other side is just spinning and he's knocking him in left and right.  Look, I'm beating you.  Yeah, I'll be beating you.  Shut up, you're not playing right.  Oh, I love the bank shot from the rear.  Wham! 
[36:30]
 We had a similar Valentine's Day, Anthony.  I spent my day with my wife, I mean my TV.  That's what Valentine's Day is for.  Alright, Eric.  Thanks a lot guys, J. Moore rules.  He's coming in again today.  That's the best thing I heard all day.  I heard it, Rand told my partners, the best thing.  I don't know when, I think sometime in the four o'clock hour.  Excellent.  Thank you, Eric.  Thanks guys.  Bye.  Let's go to...  I wasn't with the TV, I was with the check.  I think they can figure that out at this point. 
[37:00]
 I don't know, he seems to think I was sitting in front of the television.  No, you were playing like solo foosball.  Dan, what's up?  Hey guys, I applaud you, Anthony.  I've got a similar setup to my pad.  Oh yeah.  I have a buddy of mine, pool table and a dining room.  60 inch TV, DVD, VCR, a computer game room where my buddy and I are playing Team Fortress online together.  Oh, rock!  You know something?  You know how close I was to buying an air hockey game?  I swear to God, but you know why I didn't?  There's only one reason I didn't buy the air hockey game.  No room. 
[37:30]
 No, no, there's room in the dining room for foosball and air hockey.  We have a little Italian landlord living downstairs, he'd freak out.  What's going on?  Because the foosball doesn't make as much noise as like air hockey, wham wham.  It makes a lot of noise.  Just turning it on.  Just the noise factor was the only reason.  Or I would have also had an air hockey game.  You are Kevin Spacey.  Why?  I'm convinced, American beauty.  You're losing your money.  I'm convinced.  I'm convinced.  I'm convinced. 
[38:00]
 Games, fun, toys.  Come on.  That's what it's about.  Thank you, Dan.  Thanks, guys.  We've got to take a break.  We're just getting warmed up, obviously.  A lot of good phone calls on hold.  Please stay there if you want in on the conversation.  212-757-1027.  You can call us, call us.  You treat them like good people.  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, f*** you.  Jesus Christ, shut up. 
[38:30]
 Why?  Hey, f*** you.  I really like the production Jimmy's doing for our show lately.  Very good.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Fax line is 212-957-9639.  Just getting back into the radio show after taking a long weekend.  A lot of partying was going on over the weekend.  Had a lot of fun with Jay Moore at Rascals down there in Oceanside. 
[39:00]
 What a pisser, man.  Awesome.  We kind of wrecked the show though.  The second show Sunday night, it turned into like Opie and Anthony debauchery.  It was the Opie and Anthony Jay show.  We ended up on stage with Jay for like 15 minutes trying to convince a girl to show her boobs to the whole crowd.  She did.  I look to my right, there were a bunch of girls that were there with dates and stuff.  It was their little Valentine's Day celebration.  It was pretty obvious to me.  They were horrified and pissed off.  They were just pissed. 
[39:30]
 They were like, no, we came here to see some good, solid comedy, which Jay did.  He delivered big time.  But in the middle of the show, all of a sudden it's you and I up there drunk with our Budweiser trying to get a girl to flash the crowd.  I'll tell you though, I had to prove that I could work the pimp hand and get that girl to take her shirt off.  You did a fine job, Anthony.  It took some coaxing, some talking, but she did.  Finally showed the crowd.  And they dug it.  Yes, they did.  And then Jay got right back into his show. 
[40:00]
 You want to talk to the girl that flashed the crowd?  Oh yeah.  Kristen, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  What's going on?  Not much.  You were the girl that flashed everyone on Sunday?  Yeah.  My aunt was very horrified.  Oh yeah, your aunt was there and stuff?  Yes.  They came upstairs, like the backstage area after the show.  Yeah.  That was fun.  Did you have a good time?  Yeah, whatever.  I'm good like that. 
[40:30]
 What's the matter?  You pissed off at something?  Yeah, what's the problem now?  No, I was just running in the house because I'm on my cell phone.  Oh, I see.  She sounds a little aggravated.  Yeah, you called our show.  What do you got?  What do I got?  I was just calling to say hi.  You enjoyed the show.  I'm going to go talk about it off the air, I guess.  All right, Kristen.  All right.  We've got to get back to our radio show. 
[41:00]
 No problem.  Well, thank you.  No problem.  Talk to you soon.  All right, bye.  Goddamn.  Porn teeth.  Hey, Ralph, you're next on Andy W. What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I saw Louis Black this weekend at Bananas and Hesbrick Heights.  He was like, you know, he's in our pants.  There were like six of us.  Yeah.  A bunch of people took a girl on a date. 
[41:30]
 Great date.  It's like he's having a stroke up on stage any given second.  I hear it's like he's having an epileptic seizure on stage.  He's just freaking out.  He does this thing with his fingers.  My friend Jenny wanted to give him finger puppets and make them fight.  Yeah, we've seen it here.  When he goes off on a tear and he's feeling like passionate about a subject,  his fingers start twitching all over the place.  He's convulsing.  He was unbelievable.  I mean, he's funny on the show and he's funny on the Daily Show. 
[42:00]
 I hear his stand-up is just...  But live, he was outrageous.  Yeah, really smart guy, too.  It wasn't like, you know, bursh.  You just said the S-word.  My bad.  That's all right, Ralph.  It sure beats seeing female comedians.  Yeah.  Jerry Lewis?  Well, we admitted that on the show for different reasons.  I hate female comics.  We have a female comic that just comes out when she comes on the air or on TV, sitting there watching. 
[42:30]
 Have to tune away instantly.  See, I was reading that thing in the paper today.  I'm like, well, what's the big deal?  Until I realized that he took it a little further and said he can't get past the fact that they're just baby-making machines or something like that.  That's what he said, right?  Yeah. Jerry Lewis, totally bashing female comics.  I was applauding him at first.  I'm like, yeah, I agree.  You know, female comedians just blow.  I mean, they all do the exact same act. 
[43:00]
 Yeah.  And don't tell me Margaret Cho or any of those are good.  Jeanine Garofalo.  Jeanine Garofalo.  They all suck.  The only one that's kind of amusing is the deaf one.  Oh.  She is so bad.  But because she's deaf.  I go out all day.  I go to don't tell them I'm deaf.  I think they can figure it out when you go, hello.  We interviewed her in LA a few years back and I purposely made sure like I was turning my head away when I was asking her questions just to hear her say what. 
[43:30]
 I was practicing my ventriloquism.  Because she reads lips, you know.  Yeah. So watch, watch.  This is really good visual for radio, but watch out.  Here's me.  Here's me that.  So what's it like to understand a comic?  You're not moving your lips.  Nothing. Yeah.  And I'm making the puppet voice.  I can't understand you.  You have to move your lips.  Hey, how you doing? 
[44:00]
 Nice can.  Look at you, you deaf bitch.  Yeah, get out of here.  No, I'm talking to you.  I'm just smiling at her.  Wow, you did that pretty well.  Yeah, I've been practicing.  I'm going to get a dummy to play foosball with.  And then she just stares at you like a deer looking at headlights.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out what you're saying.  I can't understand what you're talking about.  Hey, you're deaf, huh?  So she's kind of amusing just because, you know, she's a freak. 
[44:30]
 Yeah.  I don't know though.  They come on the screen, I have to tune away.  And it's such a buzz kill when you're watching those cool comedy shows and like they have five comics and they're coming out and the guys are killing, you know.  And then there's like, and let's bring out our very special young lady from, oh no, not this.  Here comes the act.  She's going to talk about her mother, her stupid little car, dating.  Dating's a big thing.  She's gaining a little weight.  Right, water retention.  That's hysterical. 
[45:00]
 Oh, that's so funny.  They all do the same exact act.  Yeah, close.  Talk about their last date.  Talk about their, their overbearing mother.  Talk about how they have a crappy car.  Talking about their PMS.  What else? That's about it, right?  Talking about, you know, having sex with a guy.  Yeah.  Now it's been a while since they have.  Ah, last guy I was with.  You just all shut up.  Shut up. 
[45:30]
 So I was kind of agreeing with Jerry Lewis until.  I'll agree with him.  Until he had to like take it a little farther and say that all he sees is like baby making machines.  Well, he's an old Hollywood guy now.  And you ever notice the old Hollywood guys just get free reign to say whatever the F they want after a while.  It's that's it.  Like Jerry Lewis lost his mind.  So now he could say whatever he wants.  Yeah.  And he's still, oh, it's Jerry Lewis. You know, he must have been joking.  Until he drops dead.  Joe, Joe Soprano checking in from the Bronx.  Are you guys forgetting Kathy Griffin? 
[46:00]
 She is one hot mama.  Don't like her. Don't think she's funny.  What about that fat chink chow?  Margaret Chow.  Socks.  Rob from Jersey.  Socks.  Yeah.  And I love, love, love comedy.  I could go see comedy five days a week, but as soon as the female gets up there.  Ruins it.  Can't handle it.  Can't deal.  All right. Who's Amy from the Stock Exchange?  Amy. 
[46:30]
 Hello.  Who are you?  I work with Dave with Dave.  We love Dave.  We thought you were coming down today.  I didn't bring my suit.  My suit's at Goodwill.  Come on. Are you going to come to that?  I got wrapped up in taking a Goodwill. I got to buy a suit.  The only reason I didn't go down the floor today is I forgot my suit and they don't let you do that.  I could have a jacket and tie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, I would have went then.  Oh, we could do it that way. 
[47:00]
 Well, we'll be down there soon.  Why don't you come this week?  I'm not in the city.  We do, but we commute.  Is this on the air?  Yeah, it's on the air. Amy?  What are you doing, Amy?  I'm a stockbroker.  So why aren't you working?  I am. I just took a break.  He said they didn't come.  How does a stockbroker take a break with a half hour left before closing?  None of the actions happen around now.  It's kind of quiet today.  The last hour is where all the action takes place. 
[47:30]
 You don't see stockbroker Dave on the phone with us at 3.35.  Sorry, Dave. He's going to dial you.  Oh, Amy.  He's right here. I'll call him right now.  Amy, give me your whole take on E-Trade on the stock.  As far as the stock E-Trade?  What's the problem with it?  I don't follow those kinds of stocks.  What do you do?  You know what? I just got an order. Hang on one sec.  Oh, see? She's bugging out.  Who's this?  This is Timmy. 
[48:00]
 Timmy, I'm on the radio.  Are you a stockbroker on the floor as well?  I met you guys. I told you about the world hidden old joke.  I remember that.  So what's hot today down there on the floor?  I've been busy, man. I've been busy with all the crap.  Really?  No one wants to give any info down there.  Hello?  I think he hung up on us. I'm not sure though.  What did he say? He goes, yeah, they did hang up on us. 
[48:30]
 All right, we got to move on. That's fine.  Jesus.  Let's go to Jamie. Jamie, you're next on WNEW. What's up?  Jamie!  Hello?  Jamie!  Stop listening to your radio.  Jamie!  We were off one day and everyone forgets the rules, Opie.  They're listening to us. What is your name? You! What is your name? Hello?  What a loser!  You've got to wait for the delay to catch up to the radio so they know that we're talking to them. 
[49:00]
 Hello?  Listen. Listen to the radio. Listen.  Hey, douchebag!  Oh, hello?  Douchebag! The guy who wants to talk about female comedians.  Oh my God. Why would you just call the show and sit there?  Goodbye. Good day, sir.  Charlie from Jersey. Gilda Radner. The funniest woman ever on TV. 
[49:30]
 She was funny on SNL. Never saw her stand-up though. I'm talking about stand-up comedians.  Yes, that's not like a stand-up thing. That's sketch comedy and stuff and that's fine.  But stand-up comics, you go to the club. James, what's going on?  How are you doing?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yeah, we're just listening to the E-Trade thing. Let me ask a question.  How many people do you know that any day traders that have passed the Series 7?  Huh? 
[50:00]
 Did you ever hear of the Series 7 for stockbrokers? Probably the third toughest test in the nation.  That's how stockbrokers become stockbrokers. No day trader is really knowledgeable on that.  I mean, it's got to be ridiculous to see an E-Trader or look at the Atlanta thing.  But James, he's talking about E-Trade as a stock.  I'm talking about the stock behind the company.  Right. I want to know why it's been pegged down to 20 for a good month.  You can pick up shares of E-Trade. That's what we're talking about. Why is it so low right now? 
[50:30]
 I thought I couldn't help you on that. I'm just not an analyst.  Alright, man. Alright, thanks. Thank you for your call, though. Boy, that helped.  Patrick, you're next on any W.  Could someone put a crowbar over my head today?  I want to go home and play foosball.  I think everyone took off yesterday. We took off. Our listeners took off.  Patrick!  Yes, how are you?  I was watching Comedy Central at Paula Poundstone, Jack.  She's a female comedian. She's not that bad. 
[51:00]
 Oh, and thank God she's so attractive.  Well, that's another story.  My comedians don't have to be attractive. I just have to be funny.  It's actually distracting if a girl comic is attractive.  You don't listen to the jokes.  I don't find Paula Poundstone funny at all.  I can't think of one female comedian that I saw on stage that I thought was funny.  I can't think of one.  It's hard.  Elaine Boozler, a little bit.  A little bit. Alright, that's all I got.  Alright, man. Thank you. 
[51:30]
 Now people are going to argue their favorite female comedians.  Martin, what's up?  What's up, man?  You're like Margaret Chow.  Sorry, sorry.  Oh, you're cursing her.  She's got good ass, you should say.  Alright, she's got some good ass.  The bit about the drug dealer, have you ever heard that?  No, I'm sure you'll translate it just fine.  Mine will suck, but she talks about how you have to make fake conversations when you're trying to buy drugs.  Something we can all relate to. 
[52:00]
 Yeah, a long time listener, man.  I remember when you had like semi-sonic in the imaginary ballroom.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Alright, Martin. Thank you.  Alright, bye.  He redeemed himself there.  Brett Butler's good. Good comics are dykes.  We don't want to talk about female comics.  We just kind of agreed with Jerry Lewis, except for the line about being, you know, baby-making machines.  Baby-making machines.  Monkey from wherever.  The only funny female comics are the dead ones. 
[52:30]
 What does that mean?  Alright, we better take a break and regroup here.  My God, man.  Hey, Carol. Carol.  Yeah.  We're going to come to you right after break, alright?  Stay right there.  Carol went to a strip club for Valentine's Day. We'll get into her story next.  Shoot.  You dumb.  Your new name is Dick.  Oh, boy.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  107. 
[53:00]
 Suck out.  Yes, we are here.  Oh yeah, we are here.  Yes.  Getting back into the swing of things.  It's weird when you take one lousy day off, man.  I know.  2127571027 is our phone number.  Lots to do today.  Lots and lots of stuff.  J. Moore's stopping by.  He's going to be leaving us soon and then we won't see him for another, what, four or five months.  Yeah.  It'll be sad. We should throw him like a going away party or something. 
[53:30]
 Because he's just a huge friend of the show.  Back out to Hollywood.  Back out to Hollywood.  In Vegas. He's doing a new movie and stuff.  He's filming a movie with Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and the little kid from Sixth Sense.  Yeah.  Sixth Sense was nominated Best Picture this morning, by the way.  Oh yeah?  Does everybody by now know the ending?  Sixth Sense, I hope so.  Bruce Willis did through the whole thing.  Best Picture nominations, okay?  You asked. I'm sure someone will go, 
[54:00]
 Dude, I was waiting for a video.  The nominations, American Beauty.  Yeah.  Which I absolutely love that damn movie.  The Cider House Rules.  Chick Flick, right?  Kind of, I don't know.  The Green Mile, which was pretty good.  I didn't see that one either.  Don't worry, people. I know the ending.  The Insider, pretty good.  What? Did I say something?  Yeah.  And then the Sixth Sense.  Yeah, that was good. 
[54:30]
 I think they're going to give it to American Beauty, the Sixth Sense.  Yeah?  I think so.  I didn't see American Beauty, so I don't know.  I think Kevin Spacey is going to win Best Actor.  I think Annette Bening is going to win Best Actress.  And that's it. There you go.  There's our conversation on the nominations.  On the nominations.  Now, there is one other thing we should talk about real fast.  Tell Carol to hold on.  We're going to get to our strip club story in a second here.  The Oscars nominated.  Original song, Anthony? 
[55:00]
 Yeah.  They got a song from Music of the Heart.  They got a song from Magnolia.  They got a song from Toy Story 2.  Randy Newman. Oh, please.  And a song from Tarzan.  Phil Collins, okay?  Also, nominated in the Original Song category  for the Oscars coming up in March.  Trey Parker.  Really?  For Blame Canada from the South Park movie. 
[55:30]
 That was nominated?  Yep.  And just in case you forgot what that song is all about,  let's play it real fast here, okay?  Nominated for an Oscar, this little thing from South Park.  Check it out.  Uh-oh. There it is.  Wow. Academy Award nominated.  Okay.  All right, so they're not going to win, obviously,  but it's kind of cool that they're nominated.  It's funny that they probably have to play a little piece of it, right?  They're going to give it to Phil Collins 
[56:00]
 for that stupid song from Tarzan.  Guaranteed.  God, my wife Phil Collins used to be relevant.  I used to like Genesis growing up, too.  Now it's like it's an embarrassment to even admit that.  Tarzan soundtrack.  Let's go to Carol, Anthony, get the show going here.  Carol, you're next on any W. What's up?  You were talking before about Valentine's Day?  Yes.  So my husband took me out for Valentine's Day,  and then I took him out for Valentine's Day afterwards.  We did it on Saturday.  And I took him to a strip club. 
[56:30]
 Oh, yeah?  Which strip club you go to?  There's one that didn't open up that long ago near Kennedy Airport.  Okay.  Do you know it?  Is it one of those sleazy places?  No, it's actually really nice.  It's called the Airstrip.  Oh, we've got a couple of the girls call us for the Airstrip.  See, it's near the airport, and the girls strip,  and the planes land on an Airstrip.  It's a very clever name, Airstrip.  And all the girls have landing strips in their pants. 
[57:00]
 Yeah, landing on the grass runway.  And I'm sure my husband is probably listening right now,  and he's probably freaking that I'm calling you.  That's kind of cool.  That was your present to him, huh?  And then I got a lap dance for him.  And did you guys obviously went together?  Did the girl lap dance for both of you?  No, she lap danced for me.  For you?  For me.  And then he checked it out?  Yes.  Did you enjoy the lap dance? 
[57:30]
 Yes.  You're like just a few months away from a little threesome action.  It was a gift for him.  A romantic gift.  That's pretty good.  Well, congratulations.  There she goes, Carol.  Down at the Airstrip.  She had a little different Valentine's Day celebration.  Lisa, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  My question is this.  Who do you think they're going to get to sing this song? 
[58:00]
 Every song that's nominated is sung on the award show.  Oh, yeah?  And how are they going to do it?  That's a good question.  There's a curse word in there, too.  Because they have a performance of every nominated song.  Well, there's also another problem because the lady that sung the song, isn't she dead?  She's dead.  She's the dead one, right?  A lot of times, they'll get somebody to perform it that didn't necessarily perform the original movie.  Do like the bad version of it. 
[58:30]
 Remember what happened to Phil Collins because he wasn't popular enough and he was nominated for one of these songs and they got someone else to sing his nominated song because they only want people on there that the audience really, really knows.  Right, right.  I could see them getting a group because it's kind of a group song.  But I heard the bleep and all of a sudden I'm like, how are they going to do that?  I'm amazed that it got nominated.  We'll have to wait and see what they do.  It should be interesting. 
[59:00]
 Thanks, guys.  See you later.  Let's go to Jake.  Jake, what's going on?  Hey.  Just figured I'd share what I got my girlfriend there for Valentine's Day.  The clap?  No.  I got her a pair of boxers for the sleep and some shirts and the wackiest of things but apparently she liked it.  A bowling ball.  You got your lady a bowling ball for Valentine's Day.  A bowling ball. 
[59:30]
 Hey, what are you going to say?  Write that.  What trail apart do you live in?  Come on.  A matching bag?  No, she has a bag.  It's a history place.  Is it a pink bowling ball?  Actually it was only a glow in the dark thing.  Are you guys in leagues and stuff together?  No.  Is she in a little league?  No, not at all.  It's something we do occasionally.  It's not that bad.  You go out, have a couple beers. 
[60:00]
 You're not an occasional bowler if you have your own ball.  You got your own ball.  You're bowling.  When I go to the bowling alley, which is rare, first of all I drink more beers than balls I throw.  Right?  Yeah.  What do you say?  I used to be on a bowling league with the place I worked.  God damn, long time ago.  Navtech Industries.  I was on their bowling team.  You were on their bowling team? 
[60:30]
 Right up until the day I got fired.  I had to leave that job because they were coming to repo my car.  Remember that story?  Yeah.  That was the job you had when you were sleeping in your car and you weren't making your car payments?  I was all bummed, not because I lost the job, but because I was doing so well in the bowling league and the standings.  It was going to affect your average.  Yeah, it definitely brought my average down when I had to quit because repo man was going to take my car the next day.  That's funny.  I knew where I worked.  All right, Jake.  That's a good Valentine's Day gift.  I was at Millionaire Sunday night where the guy called Rosie. 
[61:00]
 Oh yeah.  I see he's calling Rosie, that fat pig.  Who's that?  Your category, eating.  The question is about food.  Call that fat slob Rosie.  All right, later man.  All right, bro.  Got a fax here.  If you want to send a fax, 212-957-9639-0 and A. Thank you.  Because of you guys, I ordered a Vermont Teddy Bear on Sunday for my girlfriend.  Well, it came yesterday and you know what I got? 
[61:30]
 A big, long Hummer.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Syndication out.  We told you guys if you got the Vermont Teddy Bear for Valentine's Day you would get a Hummer.  Yeah.  There you go.  A happy customer.  Did you hear about that whole thing with Millionaire?  There's a problem now that the insurance company that pays off the Millionaires.  That doesn't just come from the show.  When they have to pay somebody, I think it's between the half million and a million dollars when they get up into that.  The show doesn't have to pay. 
[62:00]
 There's an insurance company.  The show pays premiums to the insurance company.  And if on the off chance someone gets over a half a million bucks, the insurance company has to pay out.  They're all pissed because the English version of the show has never had a Millionaire.  Because it's a lot harder, the questions and all that.  So in the US I think they've had two so far.  Plus there's just a bunch of limey trunk bastards over there.  They're retarded. I've been there.  But Regis is bitching that I'm not changing the show.  They want less intelligent players and harder questions. 
[62:30]
 That's what they said that the contestants are too intelligent.  The insurance company said that.  I need retards.  Right, they can just have the short bus drive up.  Drive up? I want someone in a hot seat with a hockey helmet.  Get me Mongoloids, Gilman.  I want to be looking at a line of down syndrome haircuts.  When they spit that answer out, I want to get hit with drool. 
[63:00]
 Come on.  I need targs.  Get me Corky.  Well that's Celebrity Millionaire. I want Corky.  Get me pinheads.  Pinheads anything.  Delidermide babies.  I need retards. Brain damage.  Get me that chick that got the nail gun put through her head at the mall. 
[63:30]
 That's pretty retarded.  Yes, and bring them here.  Retards. Get me that spaz kid from the Opie and Anthony show.  Now that's pushing it.  Very good.  Alright, we got to take a break here, Ant.  Oh yeah?  Steven Lynch made a paper on Sunday like we told you guys.  Yeah, you see that.  An article in the Post. Lame story.  Julia Zabow, whatever her name is, she should be ashamed.  That's one of the worst articles I've ever read in my life. 
[64:00]
 Zabow.  Stupid, doesn't go anywhere.  And we'll read it next to just show how bad of a writer she is.  In my opinion, Julia, you're a sucky ass journalist.  That's horrible.  You should go to like the Globe or the Inquirer.  I'm glad we blew you off ten times.  Write about Batboy. Batboy scene.  It's all about that killer kitten song. We'll get into that controversy next.  Real fast as we take a break here, Ant.  Very cool. There was Opie and Anthony signs all over the ball field yesterday. 
[64:30]
 Last night at the WCW at NASA Coliseum, Spaz was there with a huge ONA WOW banner.  Cole, also last night there was an ONA banner.  Well, actually a bunch of them at the Continental Arena for the Seton Hall-UConn game, which was a huge game last night.  And all flags are courtesy of apolloflags.com or give them a call.  973-256-8362.  Opie and Anthony. Opie and Anthony. 
[65:00]
 1027-WNEW.  Opie and Anthony. Those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  I love our new IDs. 1027-WNEW. It's the ONA show.  J. Moore, a little later this hour, stopping in.  He's going to be leaving us soon.  For a while. He's got to go back and make a movie.  Go back to being a Hollywood star. 
[65:30]
 Yeah, he'll be back in the future, I'm sure.  Also a little later on, we've got to talk about Stephen Lynch.  The article made the post over the weekend.  Pretty much a non-article.  It's an embarrassment to this writer, Julia Szabo.  I'm so glad I didn't talk to her.  She called our office about ten times and we blew her off.  Thank God. I really don't want to be a part of this stupid little article she has.  But real fast, Anthony, on the instant feedback, John from Karl Place. 
[66:00]
 Anthony, please talk about The Sims.  This game kicks ass.  It's the weekend and I can't help tormenting these little creations of mine.  Best game since Kingpin.  Yeah, it's... we've been having fun with it in the office and then at home.  Well, let's talk to Bill real fast too. Bill, what's up?  Yeah, I'm going to fail this semester because of you, Anthony.  I can't stop playing it. I've got two lesbians right now at home making out.  You know, one goes to work, the other bitch works out. 
[66:30]
 You've got them to make out?  Yeah.  Oh, one of them just works out as the other one goes off to work?  Yep.  Hey, Bill, I got to tell you because after Anthony talked about The Sims on Friday,  one of my brother's friends ran out and got the game.  I spent ten hours with a lesbian couple trying to get them to make out over the weekend  and I didn't accomplish the game.  You've got to start slow.  Well, I did start slow.  A little talking first, maybe a little back rub, telling a few jokes,  maybe complimenting the other one, and then slowly go to hugging 
[67:00]
 and then before you know it, they're sharing a bed.  Are they sharing a bed, Bill?  Yeah, they share the same bed.  Oh, that rocks.  The first day, you get them, all their power levels are all up.  All you do is you spend all the time just on social, nothing else.  They fall in love with them like ten seconds.  I've got to remember that.  A couple of lesbos. That's great.  Because my chicks, they got all depressed and stuff.  The room wasn't right. The plants were dying. 
[67:30]
 You've got to water those plants. You've got to keep them happy.  The food had flies around them.  Yeah, they're not cleaning up that good.  The plumbing sucked.  Well, thank you, Bill.  No problem. Thanks a lot.  Well, and you've got to explain Sims again because honestly, God,  this is like crack, this game.  Yeah.  Well, this is more addicting than Half-Life, even though Half-Life  is a shoot-em-up type of game, this thing is just mental.  I've got to explain.  I've heard from a lot of people going,  Oh, dude, what are you talking about? That doesn't even compare to Half-Life. 
[68:00]
 They're not meant to compare.  They're two completely different types of games.  Completely.  It's like the difference between an off-road vehicle and a roadster, you know?  They're made for different things.  I love Half-Life.  I still play it all the time. I love to shoot them up first-person action.  This, it's not an action game.  You're not sitting there staring at the screen,  sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen.  But like Opie said, it is crack.  It is frigging crack.  Sitting there, so far I've concocted a couple, made everything from scratch. 
[68:30]
 You could make everything from scratch, like Ann said.  Or you could kick them out.  You could give them different personalities.  You could make the house and set it up any way you want.  Yes, that's what I did.  You could even pick their jobs.  Yeah, they look for a job in the paper.  You pick it or you don't pick it, you know?  They're either nice people or not nice.  They're neat or not nice.  There's all the personality traits.  You can put in these little people that walk around in this little house. 
[69:00]
 You buy them stuff, make their lives a little easier.  You upgrade their stoves and refrigerators.  Maybe blow a wall out of their house and make the living room bigger  so you can fit an electric train set in, keep them happy.  Pinball machines.  All kinds of fun stuff.  That's my app.  So what I've been working on is just a couple.  Just a man and a woman in a house.  Got them to fall in love. 
[69:30]
 Now they're sleeping in the same bed.  I'm getting all kinds of cool stuff in the house.  Burglar breaks in, steals the computer and the stove.  So I had to get a burglar alarm.  You live and learn.  So then one day it's like, oh, the stork is coming.  Going to bring a little bundle of joy for my little couple.  I'm feeling great.  I'm like, I'm working this game.  It's coming out perfect.  This is how this is about procreation.  So a little bassinet. 
[70:00]
 I'm moving into the bedroom.  So they're close to the little kid.  Kid starts crying.  I send the mother over.  There's a couple options.  You can either feed it, play with it, sing to it.  So I'm feeding and singing to it and stuff.  Eh, beep beep.  The car horn out front blows.  You know what that means?  Time for work.  So I send them both off to work.  It's a little bit difficult.  You got to explain too that you send them to work and every time they come home from work, it adds money to your bank account. 
[70:30]
 They make their money.  And that's how you could expand your house and stuff.  And buy cool stuff.  And move forward with the game.  Well, I got to tell you something.  This was awful.  I totally didn't.  I got so used to them just going to work that I didn't stop her from going to work.  So the kids in the house all alone for eight hours screaming.  A newborn.  You know what a little prompt comes on the screen?  Yeah. 
[71:00]
 SimCity's social services is taking the child away.  And this big fat black lady walks in the house, grabs the kid, and walks out the door while they're at work.  And then the husband and wife come home.  The man and woman are not married yet.  And then the woman gets all depressed because now the kid's gone.  Of course. And that affects the game too.  Because you've got to keep these Sims people very happy.  You've got to keep them fed.  You've got to keep their hygiene up.  If their bladder's full, you've got to make sure they go to the bathroom. 
[71:30]
 You've got to pay your bills.  Oh, I was playing a game this weekend, right, Ant?  Yeah.  There was two things I didn't do.  One was I didn't check the mailbox.  You've got to check the mailbox every three days for bills.  And you've got to pay the bills.  And if you don't pay the bills while the couple is sleeping at night, there's this big black guy.  Why is it a black guy?  I swear to God, it's a black guy in the Sims game.  That comes to your house, not breaks.  That comes to your house and they repossess your stuff because you didn't pay the bills.  So he repossesses the stove in my game, but they have to eat. 
[72:00]
 So the lady is freaking out and every six hours she's calling the pizza dude.  Yeah, they go to the phone and order pizza.  And it takes like 40 bucks out of their money.  And then the pizza dude comes up and there's a prompt that says,  Oh, it only took me an hour to get here, dude.  Are you sure that was a repo guy or was it just the rock coming in to rob the place?  And the other thing that I did during my Sims game over the weekend, 
[72:30]
 because I ended up getting a couple like you,  but I just took over one of the families they have,  which was a couple with this kid that was about 10, 11, 12 years old, that range.  And you've got to send them off to school every day.  Sure, the school bus pulls up. You've got to send them.  Well, the best part of this game is just creating havoc.  I mean, you could go and try to pay the bills and keep the house clean,  make sure the fed and happy and, and, you know, kept comfortable,  you know, putting them to bed when they're tired and stuff.  But the best part of the game is just creating some type of havoc and seeing how it plays out. 
[73:00]
 So I decide, you know what? The kid doesn't need to go to school anymore.  So day after day, the school bus is pulling up in front of the house, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And it'll only wait what 20 minutes or so.  And then the school bus takes off three days in a row.  All of a sudden there's a prompt on the screen.  Jimmy's missing a lot of school.  And the other day there's going to be a problem.  So I'm like, oh, cool.  You've got to hold him back.  So the bus goes and Jimmy doesn't get on the bus.  So it turns out that they're going to send him to military school to teach him some discipline. 
[73:30]
 So all of a sudden he's in a military outfit.  And the mom and dad are like saying goodbye and crying and stuff.  And next thing you know, he's out of the house for good. Gone.  He's at military school.  You just lost your kid to military school.  I wonder if he comes back later on.  And then you've got to keep up their skills.  Yeah, their skill level.  They've got to read and sit down and read books on things to get their skill levels up  and their social skills and build relationships with the neighbors. 
[74:00]
 All of a sudden they're working around the house.  You're pointing and clicking, making sure they're keeping the house clean,  keeping their hygiene good, making sure they take a leak and stuff.  And what happens? The neighbors come to the door.  They want to visit.  So now you've got to entertain the neighbors.  Because if you just send them away, they get pissed and your social standing in the neighborhood goes down.  You run around like a chicken without a head, pointing and clicking,  realizing this is what amounts to a digital ant farm.  It's pretty much what you're doing.  It's ridiculous. 
[74:30]
 But it's like, oh be said, it's like crack.  It's so addicting. We were playing for two hours before the show today.  And we just started this family and we're going to see how far we can take it.  Because eventually I guess you build a huge mansion.  You have other people living with you.  And then when it goes up, unbelievable.  I was playing over the weekend, right?  And I'm sitting there and the girlfriend goes out, you know, comes back.  I'm still playing. 
[75:00]
 I go, oh that was quick.  She goes, I've been gone for two and a half hours.  I swear to God I thought it was ten minutes. Ten minutes.  Like I've been gone for two and a half hours.  Oh, two and a half hours.  Gee, I've been on there that long?  You want to see your little people freak out, start a fire in the house.  Oh that's hysterical.  Well that's something else too.  You've got to read the books to get the cooking skills up.  Because if the guy tries to cook without cooking skills, like one out of every four times he cooks he's going to start a fire. 
[75:30]
 So you've got to get his cooking skill level up.  And it's the funniest thing when that stove burns in a flame and they start,  wah, wah, they run around the house with this little like a thought bubble over their head with flames in it.  And they go, ah, ah.  And you've got to run to the phone and call the fire department.  Or you do what I do and you just take your time going to the phone.  Until the fire is so out of hand that one of them is going to lose their life.  Yeah, it spreads to like all the other appliances and the walls.  So the wife lost it, she's dead and now there's an urn in the middle.  Oh yeah.  But then when they die you really feel really bad because you really start getting attached to these little creatures, you know. 
[76:00]
 I know when they die you move the urn outside and it becomes a tombstone.  Yeah.  And they'll send them out there to mourn.  Yeah and they'll sit next to the tombstone and just kind of mourn and cry and stuff.  Let's go to the phones.  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, you guys are not kidding, man.  What, Sims?  I played that game.  And by the way, this is not even an advertisement.  Nah, they don't advertise on this show. 
[76:30]
 This is just another one of those games that I came across and thought was great.  Yeah, and got me hooked on this damn thing.  I got that game.  I was waiting for something to come on TV.  And I was like, I can't even know it was ending.  So I'm like, alright, I'll keep playing.  It was four hours later and I was like, ah, this game's boring.  I'm not going to play no more.  And it was like four hours, man.  You guys know how to get a ghost?  No, you can get ghosts?  If you got someone dies, right?  You bring the urn outside before anyone can mourn.  And a ghost will come around the house and scare the hell out of them. 
[77:00]
 Oh, rawr!  Are you serious?  That is awesome.  One of my guys fell in love with the other dude's wife.  So he kept slapping the dude every time he kissed her.  So I let him burn.  And the guy burned and died and I put his urn outside and he had a ghost come around.  Wow, that's awesome.  You go on the website and they'll tell you all kinds of things.  You guys know how to get money?  We just know the job so far.  Oh, if you hit control, shift and C. 
[77:30]
 Oh, cheat codes.  No, we don't want cheat codes in this game.  You can build unlimited cash.  I know, you can build this huge sprawling mansion.  Yeah, I couldn't build a decent house so I had to cheat because I wanted to get some good stuff.  I've been building it slowly.  I couldn't afford a hot tub.  All of a sudden I'm looking around the house like it's mine.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to in time blow that wall out so I can fit a hot tub in the bathroom.  It's going to be a little while.  I can't afford it right now.  I was telling someone there's not enough hours in the day.  They're like, yeah, isn't it true? 
[78:00]
 And I was like, holy crap, man.  It's like real life.  We love the game, man.  It's crack.  All right, man.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's take a couple more of these calls.  You feel like an idiot.  That many hours in front of this frigging screen.  Hey, Jay, what's up?  ONA.  You know, I just got the crack pipe out of my mouth.  I just decided I'll give you a ring.  I've been having fun torturing them as of late.  You know how you can download extra houses off the website?  Oh, yeah, you can go to the website, I think. 
[78:30]
 You can download houses and other models and a lot of the...  I get this big crime boss and his like little frizzy bitch wife.  I put them up in a house and she sets the house on fire.  So I let him die.  I take her and I decide, let's torture her.  I stick her in a four, like four by four room.  No place she can walk.  I put a refrigerator in there, let her eat.  She starts pissing all over herself.  Then there's garbage piling up.  I don't let her sleep. 
[79:00]
 This is going on about 15 days for her.  Eventually she just peels over and dies.  Then I bulldoze the house and have somebody else move in.  It's just great to cause the havoc.  It's so addicting.  I just got in and I've been playing it for like three hours.  I didn't even realize it.  Right on, man. Well, thank you.  Hail Satan.  Dean, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  You guys got me hooked on Half Life. 
[79:30]
 Then I heard you guys talking about The Sims.  I looked all over and couldn't find it.  I finally found it in a place by my house.  This game is unbelievable.  I can actually manage my own neighbor the way I want it.  Do you make them all Hispanic?  Oh, yeah. I do everything.  Legal prostitution and everything.  Anything your heart can desire, I can do it.  Literally.  I don't need no jewelry.  I run this one.  I hope they put this online now.  Play this online. That would be cool.  I think there is an online option. 
[80:00]
 Yeah.  You can interact with other neighborhoods from people that made their own.  Yeah.  The Sims, they have it for online.  The book that comes with it, it doesn't mention anything about that, though.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, do a search. We're just getting into it ourselves.  Aunt just discovered this the other day.  Yeah, we'll pass it on, buddy.  Thank you, David. Cool.  Hey, I'm Jeff Jackson on N.E.W. What's up?  Hey, guys. I think I've lost my husband to this game.  To Sims? 
[80:30]
 Yeah.  He plays until I'm leaving in the morning. He stays up all night and plays it.  It sucks.  That's the mark of a good video game if you give up sleep to play it.  It's a good game.  Exactly.  All right. Well, thank you, Shannon.  Thanks. Bye.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun, man.  Yeah, people are hooked on this.  I mean, what have you guys done?  Great.  You got to throw like 10 people in one house.  I got like a bunch of frat brothers, right? 
[81:00]
 I got like eight people in one house.  You just let it run.  Now they're starting to fight.  They already kicked two people out of the house.  They're killing each other.  Like every time I turn, I go up to the guy, slap him in the face.  And he says, yeah, you compliment him.  And then you slap him in the face.  And then next thing you know, they're rumbling.  You got this big cloud of smoke.  They're all flying all over the place.  Nobody wants to go get the paper because they're too depressed.  Yeah.  Once you get them depressed, it sucks. 
[81:30]
 They don't do nothing.  I know. That's a good part of the game.  I got the chick kept getting depressed.  I had to buy her a stupid dollhouse that she sits in front of and plays with.  Oh, wee, go, go.  It's like laughing and stuff.  I had a husband and wife.  They both had jobs.  The guy lost his job.  And then she's sitting there and she's the breadwinner now.  Really?  He's all depressed.  He doesn't want to go get another job.  And now she dies because she's earning all the money.  And he's so depressed he doesn't want to get another job.  So he's sitting there in the living room. 
[82:00]
 He just stares at the air and he's crying all day.  He doesn't do anything.  This game is messed up.  Thanks, Chris.  All right, man.  Bye.  Dave from Jersey on the Instant Feedback Ant.  Go into build mode and remove all the doors and windows and watch what happens.  Also, crank call the police over and over for no reason.  I guess something happens after you do that a few times.  I started a fire just before.  I ran to the phone to call the fire department.  And I couldn't because I forgot I had installed a smoke detector.  And it does it automatically.  So I figured I'd better call the cops.  I called the cops and the fire department showed up. 
[82:30]
 Put the fire out and then the cops come and yell at you for calling in a fake alarm on the cops.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, man. What's up?  I don't know if you guys found us out yet.  But you take the family that you started with.  There's like three people in the family.  And they're like, hey, what's up?  And they're like, hey, what's up?  And they're like, hey, what's up?  And you have three Chinese people, a family, Mortimer and Bella and all of them.  And you're taking the two girls.  You invite them in.  And I broke up that Chinese family and I got some lesbian action going on there. 
[83:00]
 You guys try that out yet?  No.  Yeah, a couple of guys have been calling up saying they put the two girls in the house and then just let them go at it.  That's awesome.  You broke up their family, got some lesbian stuff going on.  I had the traditional family over the weekend.  The mother and the father and the kid.  And the father was going off to work.  And then all these other guys were coming to the house.  And I was trying to turn the wife into a horny housewife, giving back rubs and stuff.  But none of the guys were going for it.  Horny housewives.  Thank you, Ryan.  Bye.  Hey, Brad, what's up? 
[83:30]
 Brad?  Yeah, man, I hate that game.  You know why?  Because my girlfriend's on it 24-7.  Like crack.  Honey, come to bed.  No, I'm playing The Sims.  Honey, how about a Hummer?  I'm not done with this.  We'll talk about it again because it's going to be something we're going to watch for the next few months.  In the office, we set up a man and a woman so far in the house.  Built the house up, made the kitchen bigger, put in some better appliances for them. 
[84:00]
 And we'll see.  We'll keep you updated on how they do with all of us effing with them.  Well, that's not a bad idea.  Right now, just like you said, they're not even a married couple.  No, they're two separate beds.  Two separate beds, kind of like the I Love Lucy beds happening.  Yes.  They're a pretty small house.  Pretty small.  Starting to expand it a little bit, but they're both working.  And Ant's trying to get them to eff.  Yeah, I got to get them to socialize a little more.  You got to get them to eff before we go on the air tomorrow.  It'll be a running little soap opera with our Sims family. 
[84:30]
 They'll jump into bed.  I'll try to get that out.  But right now, they're just sharing a house with no kids and no relationship going on yet.  No.  All right, and we'll update you tomorrow.  Couple fires, Anthony said, because the guy didn't know how to cook.  But I've been working on that.  Sending them off to read the books on it.  Hey, yo guys, you guys suck.  Thank you, Rob.  I'm sorry, but listen to this beautiful description.  I'm on my way to the crack dealer.  You're going to go buy it?  Isn't that terrible? 
[85:00]
 I am on my way.  They're not even advertising on this damn show, but it's that good, you know?  We can't wait for an advertiser.  If we like something, we got to talk about it.  Thank you, Rob.  I can't wait to hook up some lesbians.  Well, let us know what you think, all right?  Yeah, we'll do.  This is so damn fascinating, this damn game.  I can't wait.  I name the families fun, too, you know?  You make your own families from scratch.  So I'm making the guy, and it's like, pick a last name.  Oh, this is the Asswipe family.  The Asswipe.

Hey, Anne, your mom did say I was hot. 
[89:00]
 Oh, come on, mom. Don't bang old people.  You f**k my mom, I'll f**k yours.  Oh, disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a hell of a toboggan ride.  Oh, the catastrophe. A couple of real motherf**kers.  Whoa, whoa.  Yes. Let's go right to Mike on the phone. Mike, what's going on today?  Hi. Hey, Mike. 
[89:30]
 I saw a J-Morp Friday Night at Rascals.  I was at the late show.  Let me tell you, the whole place was filled with O&A fans.  Everybody had signs, O&A.  People were like, I drew it on paper for Marco.  Yeah, we went to the Sunday night show and it was insane.  We stayed for both shows.  You were at the show with the black chicks up front with the wow signs, right?  There were black girls up front with wow signs?  Yeah. Mike?  We lose Mike? Yeah, we lost Mike. 
[90:00]
 Mike, wait, he went back.  Mike, one more time. Mike?  No, I hear you.  All right, go ahead.  There were people with bulls-eye signs from Marco's ass.  Yeah.  Mike, hold on.  Mike, this is Jay talking to you.  Oh, cool.  You're talking about West Orange, right?  Yeah, the Friday night show, the late one.  Yeah, there was those four sisters sitting in the front row to my right. Remember?  Yeah. And I told her I had jungle fever.  I said I liked the big black sister ass.  Yeah, Jay was trying his best to get her to whip him out, but she wouldn't go for it. 
[90:30]
 Yeah, I did.  But you missed it down the shore on Sunday night.  Sunday, we had it working.  Sunday, Rascals Ocean Township.  Kristen came up on stage and whipped him out.  I got news for you. They were lovely.  Jay, I was working the pin pan Sunday night.  Hey, my man.  Your pin pan was strong.  Thank you. Thank you, my brother. Yes.  What's with the holly holly shoes?  I can't get on the stage of any comedy club without a little dice coming out. 
[91:00]
 Here's what happened for the listeners that weren't there.  People over there, it was a very special night for them because they got to see LNA in person.  Hey, we're looking for a quarter of the door, Jay.  I think you did a quarter of your show on Sunday.  What do you think I made for that weekend? I didn't make anything.  What do you think a guy like me makes for a weekend?  I don't know. Just to get your name out there, right?  Yeah.  To kind of practice up, keep your chops.  Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, what would you say?  I don't even know. I had some figures.  I don't even know what they would give you. 
[91:30]
 I was driving home and thinking, I wonder what these guys did.  How many people were there? Like 300?  250. 250 a night, 10 shows.  But I don't get 100%. You think I...  Oh, you didn't get 100% of that door?  Only on Monday.  So 2500 people saw you for 10 shows.  I'm thinking you made, honestly, like 25 grand.  33.  I'm so honest, man.  In West Orange, it was two nights, I made 22.  Wow, get out.  If you made 33 and Aunt and I did about 15 minutes of your act Sunday, 
[92:00]
 someone's got to do the math for us.  We did 15 minutes.  I'm going to give you $100 each and we don't talk about it.  Okay.  That's for you right there.  No, you just buy...  What a jackass.  No, just buy the beer tomorrow at the Knick Game, all right?  You got it.  Okay, that's fair.  So, the night ONA were there, this girl Kristen was like,  I'm never going to get on the show. Remember me?  You know me. You know me. I'm like, how do I know you?  She goes, I'm Kristen, the girl that... 
[92:30]
 Her name is Kristen, right?  Yeah, we talked to her on Friday.  She goes, they thought I remembered, and they hung up on me, blah, blah, blah.  I'll do anything to get on the show.  And I'm like, really?  And then all of a sudden from the corner of the room, I hear,  AJ, what does she look like?  And 250 heads turn and see the gorilla sitting to my left right here.  They see Anthony and they go,  how do you get recognized from the radio?  It's the voice.  He's like, AJ, what do you look like?  And they're just like, it's got to be him.  Enough with the drama. 
[93:00]
 And then they go, hey, it's Anthony, everybody.  And the place goes bananas.  Then Opie comes up, the place goes bananas.  Krabette's there, the place goes bananas.  So they're going absolutely bananas.  The girl comes up on stage, whips out her jugs for like 50...  I mean, she took them...  I said, hey, don't do that like flip-flop baloney like...  Roll those babies out.  Let them air them out.  Let them air them out.  There's a sweat under there.  Get the sweat dry.  I like, keep them out there for a while.  She goes, all right, as long as they get on the show. 
[93:30]
 And she's like, they're not going to let me on the show.  I go, look, I know these guys, they're my boys.  If they say you're going on the show, you're going on the show.  She took them out, those things, I mean, they were out for a long time.  And then you guys go off stage.  And I look at my watch and I realize I have 45 minutes left to do.  And you've just showed live...  I just showed live nude women.  You're going to beat that.  I go, Opie and Anthony, Wanker Bat, Kristen's Breast.  I have 45 minutes.  I'm going to die. 
[94:00]
 They're going to kill me.  Did you notice the looks to your right when we were doing that whole breast thing for like five or ten minutes?  There were a few couples that were just pissed.  They're like, we came here to see good solid comedy.  And there's Opie and Anthony trying to get this girl to flash.  Solid comedy, too.  It's something for everybody on a J.M. Moore show.  The funniest was that mine and Anthony's left.  The whole side of the room was like, get out of the way!  Lock down Norton and walk in that hole!  We were in the way. 
[94:30]
 She's taking him out, Norton, down in front!  They wanted to see.  It was like a table of 50 people.  It was all one party.  We thought they were cheering, so I look over to give them the thumbs up.  And they're like, move on!  Get out of the way!  Yeah, we're like the coolest guys in the world that we're going to get a girl naked for them to see.  And they're really enjoying it.  They're like, this is great! These guys were...  And we turn in a split second to the two biggest A-holes.  Hey, these guys were...  Get out of the way! 
[95:00]
 These guys lost their minds.  Kristen's on the line. Kristen!  Listen, I'm back.  Hey! Hi, Jay!  Is this the Kristen?  I can warn you, she's a boar on the radio.  Oh, please, listen, can I actually tell you what happened?  Spaz puts me on hold, says he's going to get Rick.  Next thing I know, I'm on the air.  I had no idea that I was going on the air.  How about that? How come Spaz put a little sad face next to you?  Yeah, and it says, Jay is making this up. What's that about?  Oh, please, like I came...  First of all, I said you knew me and that was it. 
[95:30]
 You said, let's see what she looks like, because you said I was good looking and they had been calling me a pig.  What, Spaz says that I'm making this up?  No, Kristen doesn't like your interpretation of the story, of the events that unfolded that Sunday night.  Your breasts did not see daylight that evening?  Did I? I didn't say that was the lie. I said I wasn't saying I'd do anything to get on the show.  Well, you came on stage and showed your breasts.  Yeah.  Because I'm a fun-loving girl.  Because that was what you were going to do to get on the show?  Hell, for Opie. For Jay. 
[96:00]
 Oh, I see. We'll have to discuss that off the air.  For Jay.  You're right, she is dull.  Yeah, but Kristen, we've got to let you go.  Oh, God, you guys have to.  You're on your cans. I'm sorry.  We all have one special talent talking to one of them for you.  Yeah.  Alright, bye-bye.  Such a diss. Good-bye.  We all went down. She goes, oh, that's not the way it happened. She did say I could do anything.  Yeah.  A crowd full of people saw that. 
[96:30]
 Because I remember my joke was, anything, really? No, I can't do anything. I'm married.  And then I looked at her and went, no, but I'll fool around.  I'll fool around, no.  I kept doing it. I did it like ten times. I can't. No, for real.  Meet me at the show.  I'm joking. No, for real.  I did it like ten times because she said I'll do anything.  Roger, what's going on?  Hey, guys. Hey.  I was at the show Sunday night. Jay, you were friggin' awesome.  Alright, man. Thanks a lot.  It was terrific. I had the best time.  The funny thing is, I took my girlfriend there and we were one of the people to the right. 
[97:00]
 Yeah, because I saw some of those women to Jay's right when we were doing the boob thing were not happy.  Well, the funny thing is, first of all, I didn't think that girl was anything special.  I mean, it was funny and all, but I was looking at her like two deflated sweat socks on stage.  No, no.  I didn't like them too much. Okay, to each his own.  Well, you know what? She was bragging a lot. I thought she was going to be...  To each his own. Those were natural and I really thought they were really fantastic.  I'll tell you this though. The thing is exactly what Opie said that she was bragging a lot during the week prior to that. 
[97:30]
 And all of a sudden she's there and I was like, uh.  But the funny thing is that I was watching the show and I was laughing.  I turned to my left and my girlfriend is there and she's got this face and I'm like, oh boy.  Let me turn back and watch the show.  So you had to make it pretend you weren't enjoying watching the show.  You're like, this is repulsive.  You had your hand over your eyes and peeking through the middle.  Alright, Roger.  Alright, thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for the compliment, man. I appreciate it.  I gotta say, I was laughing my ass off. 
[98:00]
 And two shows. You know something also. You did two shows that night.  That were completely different.  Yeah, different.  Except for the bisexual tunnel story but that was worth hearing a second time.  And walking I had to do because they chant.  I like how you opened that.  Well, I had to do it because the second time I lose my voice so I had to do it first otherwise there's no impression.  I was like, it's funny, it's not your dog.  I thought I did so. I was like, walking.  It's not your dog's tail.  It sucks. 
[98:30]
 Next time you come to town I'm going to suggest everyone just stays for the two shows.  Just make a big huge party out of it.  Go to the bar and then get the second show.  $50 a ticket.  Next time give me $50.  Well, it's two shows.  100% goes for day one.  You know what happened to the show?  The show you guys were at, my Aunt Sally was at.  And my Aunt Sally is a special ed teacher.  She's a real nervous Nellie.  And not a fan of the Opie and Anthony show we found out.  No, it's not.  Wait, I got to say real fast.  It's not that you think you're funny. 
[99:00]
 No, that's okay.  I got to tell people, Jay was really cool to us before the show.  He was introducing us as members of his family and all that.  And we met Jay's Aunt and Jay goes, this is Opie and Anthony.  She goes, hi.  I don't listen to you guys.  She made it clear though.  She's on the show.  I appreciate that.  She doesn't shine.  But that's not her style.  She wasn't saying I think you guys are bad.  Trust me, we've heard a lot of wars. 
[99:30]
 It's fine.  I just thought it was funny that she had to go out of her way.  She knows because my Uncle Donnie listens to you guys religiously.  He was really cool.  He had to turn it off when I was whipping Marco.  He said he was working on a roof for construction.  He said it was so gay that seven construction workers on a roof at once looked at each other and went,  you know what, turn this off.  I'm going to jump off the roof.  But when my Aunt was at the show, I told you she's like real prim proper and she's the best.  But then I thought you guys would come to the second show. 
[100:00]
 So I go, you know what, I'm going to go straight clean total like the litter box, the kitty, the dog, all that stuff up front.  And then second show, I'm going to be, you know, it's all going to be about rims and being careful.  Fur hoops.  Fur hoops and whale eyes and that's Hawaii, you know.  But you guys all showed up at the same show.  So I go up on stage and I'm like trying to keep it clean for my aunt.  And then I saw you guys in the corner.  I said, you know what, my aunt's going to have to suck it up.  I'm going to be an Anthony a lot more than I get impressed. 
[100:30]
 My aunt will always be my aunt, but I like this open door policy.  I was like one, two, seven.  So then I just started going, how many guys here like to eat blank?  I remember my wife put her finger in my blank when she was blanking me.  Did you see the look here?  Did you see the look your aunt was giving you?  I didn't know what she was saying, but then afterwards she goes, that was the best.  Oh, cool. She loved it.  Well, if I knew you didn't care, I wouldn't have just let it all hang out.  You know what was great?  Actually looking at Wayne Krabett's face when you use Wayne in your act. 
[101:00]
 I was dying.  Because I did it once at another club that wouldn't give me a Dory deal here in town.  And, and, and.  Catwalk.  Catwalk.  And I did that joke.  I do a joke about my wife.  How do I say this?  Putting her finger.  Well, I think people can figure it out.  Someplace while she's performing all the sex on me.  And that's when I knew I wanted to marry her.  And I go, you can't break up with a woman that does that, that puts her finger there. 
[101:30]
 Because she'll tell all her friends and she won't say it was one finger.  She'll say it was both hands and she's clapping.  And you were bending over and you were enjoying it.  You were going, and I just usually just pick a name like, oh, Lionel, Lionel.  And so Wayne was there and so I go, Wayne, oh Wayne.  You just got to see him shake his head and look.  And like a week later I'm talking to him on the phone and he goes, dude, why did he use my name in the joke?  So then when I knew he was there I bent down and I was like, oh Wayne.  And Wayne's just disgusted.  What did he do? 
[102:00]
 He was shaking his head.  Completely defeated.  Completely defeated.  Looking at you like you ass.  How hot is Amy? Oh God.  She's very hot.  Glenn Foley was there last night, Phil Jetz and his wife.  Oh God, she's beautiful too.  Well, let's take a break here.  All the Jetz have hot wives.  You should see Vinnie Testaverde's wife, Mitzi.  Hot Jubelord.  You believe that Henry? A Jubelord in this day and age.  A Jubelord in this day and age. 
[102:30]
 I'm playing a tennis ball, Henry.  You want to help me out?  That was from the in-laws.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  A ton of people want to talk to you about your shows down there.  We should call Hackett.  We've got to tell the Bunny Hackett story next.  Good stuff.  Can I just say for once, real fast before we break, it's so good to see you guys again.  We saw you two days ago.  I know, I love you guys.  We were doing worse stuff yesterday and you heard Toretto's Warhouse? 
[103:00]
 I was on the toilet in my hotel room and it actually made, it helped me.  I was laughing so hard and I could not believe, let's just listen to it.  I was listening and he laughed and talking about it.  I was explaining it to Barry, the Brooklyn Diner.  Is this the first time you heard it?  Yesterday?  Yesterday and Barry, my manager, he never heard it before and I told him,  you don't understand how funny these guys are.  You have no idea because they work. 
[103:30]
 He hates everything.  And our agent sucks so we should talk after the show.  Yeah, really.  I'm a comedy seller.  This is 80, half a day.  Chuckle Hut in Peoria, Illinois.  Bless your bulge up with baguette seat.  Alright, let's play the Toretto Warhouse and we'll be back with Jay Moore.  Good afternoon.  Hi, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  I got your pleasure menu. 
[104:00]
 Could you hold on a minute?  I'm sorry, I have Tourette's Syndrome which makes it hard to communicate.  Oh, no problem.  Do you need prices then?  Yes.  Okay, well, house minimum starts at $100 and that's for a basic one activity party.  $100?  Well, that's pretty cheap.  That's $100.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start and then from there the sky's the limit because all the ladies are independent contractors. 
[104:30]
 You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hun, handicap's no problem.  Oh, good, good.  So I could come down and get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  So for $100, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that? 
[105:00]
 Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I can get a little bit of a headache.  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hun.  Do you take the fees?  The fees?  The fees?  A mess card?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle?  Don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't be. 
[105:30]
 That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  What?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me.  You have to come in and discuss it with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any... 
[106:00]
 Girls that aren't that attractive?  All of our ladies are very nice.  High up...  Jungle fever?  Do you have any black girls?  We have black ladies, we have Asian ladies, we have Oriental ladies.  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy.  Do you have a dwarf?  No, we don't. Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Whoop-fah!  Whoop-fah! 
[106:30]
 Whoop-fah!  Whoop-fah!  Whoop-fah!  Goodbye, okay?  But wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of fools.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Fidelity Diamond!  Yes, the engagement ring specialist.  Yeah, guys, did you miss the deadline for getting engaged on Valentine's Day? 
[107:00]
 Uh-oh. Congratulations.  They're talking to people that are truly in love here.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, if you really want to shock her, give her the ring this week.  Oh.  You want more action and you want hummers?  Go to Fidelity Diamond and get the ring.  What?  Supposedly, because last time we said, you know, guys, if you get the engagement ring, you're going to get a hummer?  Yeah.  10 guys called Fidelity Diamond to get their rings.  Diamond does equal hummer.  I would think so.  You know, get the ring, get engaged, that's cool, and go to Fidelity Diamond because they're not going to rip you off. 
[107:30]
 You know, they explain the whole process.  They explain why a diamond is good and all that.  You can pick out the diamond, you know, and they'll take care of everything right in front of your eyes.  It's not set so you can see the underside of the diamond.  They teach you about it.  They educate you.  There's no trickery at Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist.  Jay Moore is doing like three stooges at Prashen's in the hallway.  He's distracting me.  Jay, though, you get the engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond, but make sure your engagement lasts a really long time because the hummers definitely dry up after you get married, I believe. 
[108:00]
 That's what all my married friends have told me over the years.  Okay, here's the deal, too, Anthony.  Buy your diamond engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond and get a platinum engagement ring setting for free.  That's a $500 value.  Jay, does the hummers dry up after you get married?  No, my wife is, you know, Chris Frogs, there's three kinds of women.  There's one woman that don't do it.  She's the kind that do it just enough to shut you up.  And the third kind of woman is the best. 
[108:30]
 The woman who's never happier, you know, when she's got that in her mouth.  Yeah, how to get married one.  So which one is your wife?  My wife loves to do it.  Very good.  She enjoys doing it.  With you or?  Who cares?  All right, call Tom Colosino, the president of Fidelity Diamond.  We're recovering from the Tom KKKKKKKKK.  For confidential appointment for Fidelity Diamond 201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555 for Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. 
[109:00]
 Oh, for you, Anthony.  Yeah, can we get these illiterates off the airplane?  Please, suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027-WNEW.  WNEW.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay Moore in the studio.  Hey, Jay, when are you going home, by the way?  I'll be in LA, like the 25th of the month of February, Black History Month, I like to call it.  Yes, my African brother. 
[109:30]
 When do you leave for good, though, as far as New York?  The 25th.  Oh, you're going to be in town until the 25th?  I'm going to Boston, up at Faneuil Hall at the Comedy Connection.  Ah, Comedy Connection, yes.  I might be in Boston this weekend.  You should pop in.  I might be like a deadhead, just follow Jay around for a while.  I'll be at the...  Are you really...  Sell spaghetti out in the park and last for a month so you can go to the next town.  I'll be at the Boston.  I'll be at the Boston either.  I'd sell him to Stutter.  I'll be at the... 
[110:00]
 That's so freaking ridiculous.  Define every law of comedy.  When you broke into the Three Stooges and she didn't hang up on you, like, you're going...  Like, the back of your going...  I think you're like, you said, clang, clang, clang.  And the back of your head that you didn't hang up, just to fight every law.  That's why I got to break into her early that I had a problem.  You have a bye-bye, the hacker. 
[110:30]
 You have a muscle.  I hate to clamp down on one of the girls.  I'll be at the Boston audience.  If you come up, give me a...  We got to get Bruins tickets or Celtics tickets.  Anyone have connections in Boston?  Really?  We don't want to be in the nosebleeds, though.  What kind of tickets?  Anthony the limo driver.  What kind of tickets can you get us?  I'll try my best.  Not the upper deck like the Mets, I promise.  This guy, this guy, he's giving me tickets for a Met game? 
[111:00]
 I don't think anyone has ever sat that high at J-Stadium.  He was with the lights.  Pretty much.  Give the buck to Mario.  The sniper was right above him.  The sniper was below him.  There's some hairs on a 727 from Opi's head.  I was going to say that we were so high up that when the planes flew over, I was ducking because I thought I was going to get hit.  Thanks for the fix, Anthony.  I was at the garden once and I was so high I was actually looking down at the scoreboard. 
[111:30]
 At a basketball game.  That's pretty bad.  Back in the 90s, the Knicks Bulls, the classic showdowns, everybody would go, Scalp!  I had to go and I scalped them, it was like 200 bucks each.  And I go in and the guy goes, these are counterfeit next?  I was like, I'm going to bury him.  He just looked at it for like one second.  That happened to me too.  And he just whipped them up and I was like, what if they weren't counterfeit?  What if the guy made a mistake and just destroys them?  He goes, counterfeit next? 
[112:00]
 And I'm just standing there and there's a sea of humanity.  And you're nobody.  Playoff fever behind me, I'm getting steamroll.  I'm like, I'm going to go back in the street and scalp them again.  But the Jersey guy, the first thing I'm doing is trying to find the original guy to beat the Snot.  Yeah, he's still hanging out.  He's at showroads in a buddy booth.  Making the Aleutian Islands on the floor.  You guys, think you're on my trail in Aleutia.  You think you're right there. 
[112:30]
 I think you got me and I slip away.  Patty, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Hi, I just wanted to know.  Let me explain it to Jay more, okay?  Jay, this is Patty the stalker.  Not a real stalker.  She's a very handsome man, Patty.  She loves oping.  I love everybody.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think that's what they said on Bill.  I know that, you know, Buddy Hackett said that line in the Abbott and Costello story. 
[113:00]
 He said, I love you, Lou.  He goes, I love you too.  I love everybody.  I heard it yesterday.  People can't laugh when you're breathing in.  When we call Buddy Hackett in a little while, could you talk to him as Buddy Hackett?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, explain to Jay more, Patty, how she just happens to be always around.  She's hysterical.  She loves Opie, sends him cards for every occasion, writes little notes of congratulations when the ratings are good and everything. 
[113:30]
 All of a sudden, she sounds like a pretty good fan.  It's so bad, all of a sudden, it's like a whore with a fizz.  That's a joke.  Oh, is it?  I just hit the end button.  You're playing with Anthony's little machine over here.  Excuse me, are you trying to talk to me?  Patty kind of forgets that it's like...  Patty, shut up.  I get congratulatory like...  No, she's totally stalking Opie.  So then, she just happens to always be within a block of this building. 
[114:00]
 Doesn't matter.  Where are you right now?  I just visited Ronald.  She's upstairs.  Then that's her other excuse.  She visits one of the guys who does the news at 1010 and wins.  So now, she's upstairs.  Excuse me.  Hold on, same thing.  Have you ever seen her?  Yeah, they bring her in just to make me really uncomfortable.  Excuse me?  Patty supposedly has a friend upstairs that works for wins. 
[114:30]
 That's her excuse for getting in the building.  I go up to see Ronald, Opie.  It's Patty.  I want to come down and meet Jay Moore.  I was getting a haircut in Soho.  On my way back, I realized I was only 14 blocks from the sea train.  Which gets off at Penn Station, which is only a 17 block.  We can sing together or we can't talk together.  And Reynolds is right next to me, by the way. 
[115:00]
 He just came in.  He's here.  Who?  I'll sleep with him.  Put him on.  Reynolds can't understand why she won't leave him alone.  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you doing?  So, if Patty came up to see you...  Yes.  Enough's enough.  How many times has she seen you in the last week?  Well, I've been real busy.  So, what's the day, Tuesday?  So, only yesterday. 
[115:30]
 So, I constantly hear Reynolds' name on 1010 wins, by the way.  I think that's why she's stalking you.  I think so.  Because you have name recognition.  What's your last name, Reynolds?  Joseph.  They say it on wins all the time.  Leave the last name out for saving.  It's just Reynolds.  So, you love when Patty comes and visits you, right?  Yeah, it's a diversion.  It's a kicky diversion.  Now, Jay doesn't know what Patty is like or looks like.  So, I guess we're going to send her down. 
[116:00]
 Put it this way, Jay.  She would win a Joey Ramon lookalike.  Swear to God.  Swear to God.  Baby Joe's cat.  She's a good one.  Listen, we're not getting into that today.  But why not, Diamond Duster?  Shut up.  Give me my money for appearing on your stage.  No, when you turn it down.  Okay, I'm going to send it down.  All right, hold on. 
[116:30]
 So, what's the deal with Patty Reynolds?  Now that she's awake.  Wait, now she's awake.  This is the best when Reynolds could talk when she leaves.  Now, Reynolds, tell us the truth about Patty.  Is she stalking you?  No, unfortunately.  We went to high school together.  You end up a news guy, 10-10 wins.  And she ends up a french fry girl at McDonald's.  Is she an info?  No.  She's not even like a good stalker. 
[117:00]
 No, that's probably...  No, this is the kind of stalker that, like, if you say the wrong thing, she'll probably be there with a high-powered rifle to take out when you leave the building.  She reads books in our courtyard outside the building.  When I arrive to work, I'm like, oh my God, how are you?  Oh, hi, Patty, how are you?  Yeah, you walk into the door, but you're sitting there.  Oh, it's a witchy singer.  All right, well, she's right outside the studio, Reynolds.  All right, Reynolds, go write some news.  I will.  All right, thank you, Reynolds.  Good luck to you guys.  Reynolds, you're so... 
[117:30]
 10-10 wins.  I love when people add an S to a name for no reason, like...  Reynolds.  I'm trying to be like, did you see...  Did you see Spike Owens last night?  James versus stalker.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Up to the microphone.  It's Mark David...  Hello, Patty.  It's Mary David Chapman.  I'm not a stalker.  Why is she holding Catcher in the Rye?  The favorite book of all stalkers.  Since high school...  I've read that book since I shot John Lennon. 
[118:00]
 I don't have to read it.  I read it 500 times.  I know it by heart.  You got balls.  You got balls making fun of her in person.  Oh, he's trembling.  Look at his hand.  He's actually shaking.  Yeah.  Patty, I think Opie needs a hug.  No, no, no.  We're not doing the hug.  I think Opie needs a hug.  Why not?  You let Marco kiss you.  He just decided we're not doing the hug.  We're not doing the hug thing today.  I took more fag stuff over the weekend.  Listen, dude, what was his name?  At my live shows, we were going, fag, Marco. 
[118:30]
 And then one of my friends, Billy Mac, the cop, he downloads all the pictures from the unofficial website.  And the picture of Marco kissing you!  Yeah.  And everyone's going, you're a fag, you whip a gay guy.  Marco nailed him, man.  Right when the flash went off, he leaned over and kissed Opie on the cheek.  And Marco's face is blacked out because you don't want to be recognized.  Yeah, but my face is blacked out.  Thank you.  Can they black out my face?  I don't want to be recognized.  You can black out your fence, too.  Fence, Sarge.  All right, you know what?  Black out the fence.  Black out the fence.  Chalk up the fence.  Chalk it up, Norton. 
[119:00]
 Hey, Patty.  Patty, have you ever met a Hollywood star before?  No.  Oh, I believe you need to give Jay a little hug.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Take her headphones off.  Patty, what movies have you seen that Jay's been in?  It came out like a year ago or something.  Which one, Go?  I don't remember the name, but I mean, I've seen him in a couple things.  He gets little bit parts and stuff.  Don't get excited.  Oh, my God.  But I can't remember.  It isn't something about a fairy.  It's something else. 
[119:30]
 Where he kisses the sky wolf?  When he kisses the guy?  Yeah.  The yellow miata?  Yeah.  The yellow miata?  Go.  Yeah?  All right, you want to give Jay a hug?  When's the next time you're going to get to hug a Hollywood star?  Go ahead.  Take your headphones off.  Let's go.  Oh, no.  Rick, take your headphones off.  You know what?  I'll do it just for the website.  Okay.  All right, Patty the stalker.  I'm the team player I am.  I'll do it just for the website.  Grab her ass.  All right, Patty.  Oh, my God.  Okay, Patty is getting to meet Jay. 
[120:00]
 I'm getting to meet him.  I'm getting to meet him.  I'm getting to meet him.  I'm getting to meet him.  I'm getting to meet him.  I'm getting to meet him.  Hey, Jay.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, exciting and new.  How did that feel, Patty?  Your hair smells delicious.  Oh, thank you.  I just washed it.  That's good.  Gee, your hair smells terrific.  You just washed it?  Yeah.  It's not Wednesday.  That's good.  I'm all wet.  Hey, Patty.  Thank you, Jay.  I'm all wet now.  I'm leaving a trail like a slug.  Hey, Patty, Mohawk or Triangle?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[120:30]
 Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, funny.  Looks like Don King's head in a leg lock.  He's funny.  He's funny, right?  Good.  When you have to give Shawn Lennon his glasses back?  What?  When you have to give Shawn Lennon his glasses back?  Excuse me?  I don't know.  By the way, who won the eye procedure, because I didn't answer the contest.  Oh, no, huh?  You didn't win some other guy. 
[121:00]
 I placed.  They gave you the sweater.  Patty, what does it look like?  They're a surplus of chess king.  What does it look like when you poke your drawers down?  Is it Fidel Castro eating a London broil?  It's a black cat with a throat slit.  Nothing good has happened to you since that first game before.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  She had a patch of gray. 
[121:30]
 Is that it?  Is it gray?  Maybe it looks like Phil Donahue's head in a leg lock.  I saw Marlo Thomas today.  Did you?  Where?  I met Martin Bregman, the producer of every Al Pacino movie ever.  Yeah?  At a general meeting.  And I'm walking out, and she's sitting on the couch.  I was like, man, what am I meeting this people for?  I should just get the part.  And then I'm like, Marlo Thomas is sitting there.  Wow.  Is she auditioning for something?  I guess.  Are you going to give us some part, Jay?  Yeah, right.  We want you guys to play wacky DJs.  Yeah, we'll just be in the background. 
[122:00]
 Just be ourselves.  Better yet, even just, it'll be like out of a car radio.  Yeah.  You'll be driving somewhere.  Do you like the Mad Dog and Bad Lieutenant?  Yeah.  They lose four games in about seven games.  They go back to the finals.  They have a boost on base, they have a boost on him.  Pretty good, Mad Dog.  I have the approval right?  Let's take a break.  Those guys have a commercial, every commercial.  We'll be back on the fan, Mike and the Mad Dog.  We'll be back after this.  Long time listener, first time caller.  Isn't everybody? 
[122:30]
 Oh my God.  Every game that the Reds win, the Mets, we'll get tight.  We'll be back after this.  Rawbelly will break out.  Guerrero is going to break out.  Remember when the Dodgers had all those guys who couldn't pronounce?  Rawbelly will break out.  Guerrero will break out.  Jay's got that lisp.  You're on radio with a speech impediment.  That's great.  That is why it's from Tar-Roder.  Don't forget after us, stay tuned for Nick's update with Droopy Dog. 
[123:00]
 You know what?  Patrick Ewing sucks.  He looks like Dionne Warwick.  She shouldn't have done that.  Patricia Ewing.  I like that Patrick thumbs his wife for a Nick City dancer.  There's a guy.  There's a choice.  This is the woman that knew me when I was illiterate in high school.  This is the woman that knew me when I was selling fruit in Cambridge. 
[123:30]
 The woman that taught me what speed stick is, that you don't actually eat it.  I thought it was like a push-up from the good humor.  As my children, I make $18 million a year.  Let me stick it to a four-foot ugly girl up close.  I don't know if you see those dancers, they're really hot from far away.  I go to the Lager games and I'm in the tunnel and I see them walking by. 
[124:00]
 I'm like, woof.  What happened?  They're just little chains smoking freckly four-foot midgets.  Well, Patty, are we done with Patty?  Patty, what is your goal as far as the whole OP obsession?  I'm not obsessed.  I love this song.  No.  I'm not obsessed.  He turned it off on me.  I didn't turn it off.  Every time I reach for it, OP turns it off.  Very shagadelic.  Look at her glasses, Vic.  Very shagadelic. 
[124:30]
 Commenting on Patty's glasses, very good.  Shall we shag now or shall we shag later?  Yeah, baby.  Hey, Patty, would you like Jay to put a bullseye on your ass?  Oh, man.  I only do that to men.  Well, Patty, good segment.  Thanks for coming by.  Yes.  How is Reynolds?  Reynolds, fine.  Fine. 
[125:00]
 Oh, my God.  Could we like, you know?  Yes.  Come on, Patty.  Let's go.  Chop, chop.  Anthony's going to throw it up.  Have a good day, Patty.  Bye, Patty.  Where are you going?  You're going bowling.  You're going bowling.  I'm on a league.  You're on a league?  What, are you a pin?  Hey, Patty, what are you looking at?  Your crotch, O.P.  No, she looks right through you.  Yeah.  What are you looking at?  She's an hourglass figure, but there's only 20 seconds left. 
[125:30]
 Patty, even you have to dial.  That's a good line, right?  I came over and hugged you.  I like you, Patty.  These guys, they think you're a mess.  I think they'd rather have that crazy opera guy in here than an opera man.  We're trying to get him on the show.  It's either Jay Moore or the opera guy.  Bye, Patty.  Bye, Patty.  So long, Patty.  Say hi to the camera.  You're a nice little figure.  You like a dumper?  You were looking at a dumper? 
[126:00]
 I had to say something positive about how she left so she wouldn't stab me.  Help the Skelter.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Help the Skelter.  There's someone that went to your show that's a little pissed off.  Dana?  Yeah?  What's wrong?  Hi, guys.  You went to the Jay Moore show on Thursday?  Yes, I did.  What's the problem?  Well, first of all, I think he's awesome.  I left my five-month-old with a 103 fever to go see him.  You know you say, negligent parenting?  Yes, I was.  Social services took your kid and then what?  Exactly. 
[126:30]
 It's the Sims.  I was controlling your life the other night.  Jay, you are awesome.  Except up until the point where you got to the mermaid and the algebra joke and you picked on Whippany.  What?  No, first of all, that wasn't my joke.  Well, but you picked on Whippany.  What?  I might have mentioned Whippany.  I don't know Whippany from Adam to actually stand there and make fun of you.  Are you from Whippany?  Yes, I am.  What did I say specifically?  Well, you were talking about the algebra and then you were, God, now I can't remember. 
[127:00]
 I can't remember.  You were just making fun of us.  No, that's false.  I don't make fun of people.  I told you in my act.  I don't do that.  I hate when comics make fun of the audience.  I hate when you're in the front row.  I was in the audience that wasn't talking back to you.  Sorry, she used to answer your questions.  So what was the problem there?  Oh, no, don't count me out.  What?  All right, Jay, you're awesome.  You're going to hang up before they get me out.  What?  Dana?  Ah, she went.  We'll be back with more of the 72nd Annual Oscar Award. 
[127:30]
 She was onto it though.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  There was an algebra.  The algebra joke is hilarious.  I was doing that joke and I go, you know who needs algebra?  Algebra teachers.  And some lady screamed and I looked down and she was an algebra teacher.  And she goes, you know what algebra is?  It's what a mermaid wears.  And the place just...  Algebra.  Okay.  And I said, I didn't get it.  Yeah, I didn't either.  I'm in like crazy comic mode. 
[128:00]
 I'm like, what?  She goes, algae?  Bro?  And I go, comedy's not easy, is it, lady?  You know?  You tell that to the kids, huh?  What are you teaching algebra in second grade?  And then, so that's what she's talking about, the mermaid.  She goes, then you did your mermaid bit.  Yeah.  The school teacher did it.  All right.  People get so freaking confused.  Is this the famous Ingrid?  Yeah.  All right, hold on, Ingrid.  Hold on.  Ingrid, you were so popular.  Every show I did, someone would go, Ingrid. 
[128:30]
 Guys, take it out, wax it up.  Yeah, we've got to take a quick break.  Get Mr. Grugg sex wax and start chalking up your board.  Chalk your board up.  Chalk it up!  Chalk it up!  All right, Ingrid.  Yeah.  Hold on, okay?  All right.  We're going to talk to Ingrid next.  She's the 19-year-old bisexual...  We've got to call Hackett.  And we've got to call Buddy Hackett.  Yeah.  Lots to do on the show today.  J. Moore in the studio.  In the house.  Yeah, when is he going to go home?  Oh, man.  Don't get in my head.  I'll be embarrassed now.  I don't want him to come back.  No, no, no. 
[129:00]
 See?  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Oh, P and N today.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualified myself because I got them both.  Who's the dad, weirdo?  1027 WNEW.  Okay.  You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  Okay.  You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  Okay.  You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  Okay.  You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  Okay.  All right, we're back.  Jay Moore in the studio again today.  Keep wheeling and dealing while we're trying to pay some bills there, Anthony.  That's all right.  It's pretty funny.  Letting us in.  No, I'm not saying anything.  I'm not going to say anything. 
[129:30]
 You little assholes.  The private world of Jay Moore.  Kind of fun.  Nothing for bet-esque now.  All right.  You want to talk to Ingrid?  You guys got Courtney?  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  I met Courtney.  You want to say hi to Courtney?  You gave her tickets last week on our show.  That's the girl that you guys thought was a hog.  She had no real relationship.  Hey, come on.  What? 
[130:00]
 What happened?  Hey, Courtney.  Hey, what's up?  Is this Courtney that I met?  Yeah, this is her.  You guys dumped her last week when I called you guys and she was on the phone because  you thought she was lying about her rights.  Oh yeah, that's right.  Because what?  Because you tell her, Courtney.  Yeah, you tell her.  What, last week?  They dumped you because they thought what?  No, they never dumped me.  Well, you were on the air with us and then Jay called.  We blew you off so we could get an update from Jay or something.  Oh yeah, no, it was you had me moaning for him and then he was getting off the phone. 
[130:30]
 Yeah.  And I got the tickets and then you just put me on hold so I could talk to someone.  So I didn't really talk to you guys for a while.  You told me when you came backstage that they dumped you because they thought you were lying  about your looks.  What?  No, no, I didn't.  Look, I don't drink.  I don't do drugs.  All I do is I tell jokes.  I'm not high.  I remember what you told me.  Right.  I know I didn't do a mermaid joke.  Yes, they didn't.  Anyway, Courtney's pretty hot and she's got a very, you know how they call Barclay the  round mound of rebounds?  She's got very round mounds and I would like to rebound.  Nice Jay.  Those things are gigantic.  How do you harness those things? 
[131:00]
 Yeah, what size are you, Courtney?  She's a double D.  Yeah?  No, 36C, like a full C.  A full C.  You were resting your chin on them.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  I'm a double D.  You were pushing them up.  The miracle bra is for A cups, honey.  Know what we should play today?  Bra bingo.  Oh, what's bra bingo?  We make these little bingo cards with bra sizes and we play a game of bra bingo.  We have the girls calling with the bra sizes.  It's a good little game, Jay.  Only we're playing for money.  Yeah, we can play for money.  Yeah, that's what we've got to do.  All right, Courtney.  All right.  Did you enjoy your show, Courtney?  Yeah, it was great.  It was actually the second time I saw him. 
[131:30]
 I saw him at Florida State.  I saw him at the first time.  I saw him at the first time.  I saw him at the first time.  I saw him at the first time.  I don't know if this...  Oh, if the black audiences stand right up.  Yeah, they stand right up.  It's unbelievable.  This is Barry Katz.  My manager has been fired by some of the biggest names.  Really?  Yeah, you know...
