 Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  OP and Anthony, more stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  It is OP and Anthony.  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  Alright, let's go to the phones and talk to a few people here.  Emily!  Good afternoon.  Hi, Emily.  How are you?  Emily.  Oh, holly. 
[00:30]
 What's going on?  Well, I heard your bit last night about Star Jones and the Fat Lady during the halftime  show.  And when you talk about black people, when you talk about gay people, I never get the  sense that you dislike them.  I know you guys are not a radio show, but when you talk about fat people, whoa.  I mean, I heard the discussion, Anthony's voice, and I'm a big person, hopefully not  for long.  Well, how fat of a broad are you?  Okay, I am 5'3", two bills. 
[01:00]
 Two bills.  Two bills, no doubt.  Alright, let me explain the fat thing.  Explain it to me.  Let me, there's a reason why they're saying that.  There's two types of fat people, okay?  There are fat people that really, really truly can't help it.  Yes, that's true.  It's in their genetics.  It's hereditary.  It's all that.  I truly believe that, okay?  Yeah.  And then there are fat people that are just slobs and don't want to take care of themselves  and eat themselves into oblivion and gain an S-load of weight. 
[01:30]
 Which one are you?  Well, maybe they can't help themselves either.  Well, you know what was funny?  I saw last night on the news, speaking about the radiation thing up there at the nuclear  power plant, they went into a bar.  There's a guy that must own this bar, swear to God, had to be 400 pounds.  He's talking about, you know, an earlier warning would have been nice about this nuclear steam 
[02:00]
 being released.  I didn't know until hours later this could be a health concern.  Health concern?  I'm like, dude, I'm looking at the screen going, dude, never mind the radiation, how  about your cholesterol?  Right, put down the hamburger and the fries.  That's a health concern at this moment in your life.  That's true.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  That's why I'm losing weight, but hey, there's got to be a reason why they say the bigger  the cushion, the better the pusher.  Well, that's, the big people say that.  No, actually a skinny person told me that.  Chubby chaser, chubby chaser. 
[02:30]
 That's a fetish, like being dumped on.  I don't mind fat ladies because they give the best hummers because they have to try harder.  Why are you losing weight?  I've got to ask you something.  Why are you losing weight?  Why am I losing weight?  For my health, because I want to be around for my kids, kids, and I want to grow old  with my husband.  Not to look better?  That's, you know what, I just put it out of side effects.  Alright, side effects.  When you lose weight and people start coming up to you and go, wow, you look great, you're  not going to feel good about that?  Yeah, I do. 
[03:00]
 I do.  I was much bigger, much, much bigger.  Oh my God, really?  Yeah.  Now, is it in your family?  Yeah, well darn near.  Is it in your family or you just can't put down the 20s?  To tell you the truth, I don't know about my genetics because I'm adopted.  I have no idea whether it's a genetic thing.  I saw a lot of anger, along with a lot of pepperoni pizzas.  It was, yeah, it was some over eating and mostly not exercising.  Really?  Eating and no exercising?  Exactly.  You got fat, go figure that one out. 
[03:30]
 Yeah, well.  And have you always been a little chubbette?  When you were a kid, growing up?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah?  I saw my daughter laughing in the background, I'm going to kill her.  Now, what's the problem with us?  Is your daughter a little pudgy?  Excuse me?  Is your daughter a little pudgy?  I don't want to bring her into that.  Well, you bet, well let me tell you, whether you do or not, you better just.  She's listening right now.  Get her on the right path.  Get her on a diet.  Believe me, believe me, we are.  You know something, because there's nothing worse than seeing a couple of fat parents  with fat kids because you know something? 
[04:00]
 But you know what, it's not so long.  Well, let me tell you, you've got to get your kids on the right path because it's pathetic.  All of a sudden there's a fat kid and then the parent teacher conference and everyone's  like, look at the fat parents, the fat kids, a big family of weebles walking into the school  and it's embarrassing for the kid.  Okay, but let me ask you a question.  Why, you know, I don't get that angry tone in your voice when you're talking about it.  Well, because black people can beat us up, we can run away from fat people.  That's pretty much it. 
[04:30]
 That is the prime reason.  We know we're pretty safe.  We're frightened of the blacks.  Not all the time, but you know what?  We know we're safe when we're talking about the blind or fat people because they can't catch us.  Oh, okay, that's your reason.  It's cool with the blind people.  You just be quiet and watch them walk around.  We sad people listen to you guys.  We want to know that we're loved too.  Of course, you're just sitting there all day.  Emily, I believe it's in your head. 
[05:00]
 It's your insecurities because Aunt Nye, we really try to make fun of everything.  Whether you think it's right or wrong, that's what we like to do on this show.  Yeah, I know.  My daughter and I were laughing our asses off too when you were talking about Star Jones.  Yeah, let me tell you about Star Jones and the reason that I sound disgusted and I'm pissed off at her.  Is it just because she's overweight because she's fatty?  No, she tries to come off like a diva.  She's calling herself a friggin' diva.  Why is that such a bad thing? 
[05:30]
 Because she's not.  Let's call a spade a spade.  Let's call a spade a spade.  And that's not a racist comment.  Literally.  Not a racial reference?  No.  She is big.  She is fat.  But she's secure about herself.  But you know something?  But don't try to pass it down our throats.  She's a diva.  That's everybody kissing her big fat black ass saying she's a diva.  And then what?  When they turn around?  You think when she's not in the room they're all like, isn't Star beautiful?  No, they're talking about what a big fatso she is. 
[06:00]
 And how she can't get away from the buffet table.  But she loves herself.  I mean how many skinny girls are in L.C.A.  How do you know she loves herself?  And they're beautiful.  She could be putting on a front and then at home she could be crying over her yodels.  That could be true.  She could be putting on a brave front.  But how many beautiful, wonderful skinny girls that come into your studio and wow you go  home and cry themselves to sleep because they think they're ugly.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[06:30]
 I don't know.  You make a great point there.  All I'm saying is people are full of crap when they turn around and people like Star  Jones, self-proclaimed diva, when anybody who looks at her just goes, they don't go,  oh my God, on the outside.  And I'm just saying this is purely on the outside thing.  I'm not talking about a personality.  I'm not talking about anything.  I'm just talking about when you look at somebody right on the outside when you see them the  first time, they're not going, what a beautiful diva.  They're going, holy crap, look at that ass like a truck. 
[07:00]
 But not everybody.  Maybe that's your opinion, but I'm sure it's not everybody.  I don't know, man.  That's a lot of women.  Yeah, I know.  That's just a lot of women, but.  When was the last time she saw her patch?  And all fat people are so funny.  They're all, not all okay, then people call and say you said all.  A lot of overweight people are always saying, oh, accept us the way we are.  We're great inside.  This is how we are. 
[07:30]
 But what are they all trying to do?  Lose the weight.  None.  And if one out of a million.  Is Ms. R. Jones trying to lose weight?  Definitely not.  Yes, she's always talking about losing weight.  She never does.  But I mean, if they finally do lose weight, then they go on the, get on their high horse  and start talking about how all fat people got to lose weight.  They're like recovered alcoholics or smokers.  You can't shut them up.  You know, we could ask the question today to our listeners.  What's the first thing they think?  What? 
[08:00]
 Shaved or booby-booby?  What's the first thing they think?  I wish I'd have gotten in on that contest, but I don't think my kids would have approved.  No, they have to answer the phone too, honey.  Let's ask this question to the listeners today.  What's the first thing they think of when they see a fat person?  Knowing the listeners, I know what their first response is going to be.  What'll it be?  It's going to be, look what a fat ass she's got.  I know it.  I get that response too.  On line eight, Mike has a little compassion.  Let's get him on the conversation.  Mike.  How you doing? 
[08:30]
 Hello, Mike.  Listen, you fat slop.  Men hate fat women.  The sweat in between the rolls, the more pushing, better cushion.  It's like a wet and wild ride.  You get on top, you don't know where you're going to end up.  You need a little flower to find a hole.  I mean, what's going on over here with you?  Wow, I thought that was going to be a compassionate call.  Compassionate?  Are you kidding me?  I see her in the Toyota.  She's almost on two wheels.  No, that's not me.  I mean, this is why we're slipping and sliding in the snow, because she's sliding all around, 
[09:00]
 because she's so fat.  Oh, my God.  She sounds like a nice person.  Emily, I apologize.  It says on the screen, Mike loves fat bitches.  Yeah, I love them so much.  They should be eliminated.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him.  I'm sure you can't pinch an inch off of him.  Yeah, who's he?  Oh, what's that?  Yes. 
[09:30]
 As we descend through the depths, we see the blue whale.  Emily, what are they saying?  I'm getting the abuse here.  What are they saying, Emily?  Hello?  What is that?  Uh-oh, my daughter's getting very mad with you guys.  Why?  Why?  She's listening.  She's listening on the other end.  How old is your daughter?  She's 17.  And how much does she weigh?  Tell you the truth, I don't know.  She's not skinny.  We're not built that way. 
[10:00]
 She's not skinny.  You know something?  You can be.  We're not built that way.  I swear to God.  You can be.  Emily.  Please, please, please.  I do not do rich as feminine.  God, I hate it.  Emily, Emily, you can lose the weight.  Emily, Emily, listen to this flaming fang.  Emily, feel him, feel.  Try my spray.  I love it.  It comes in a pump dispenser, my spray, for all the men out there.  You spray it on your salad, and then I toss it.  Okay.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies.  It's sweating to the oldies. 
[10:30]
 Emily, you can lose the weight.  You spray it on your salad, and then I toss it.  Okay.  It's sweating to the oldies.  Emily, lose the weight.  All right, line three swears he loves fat chicks.  Mike.  Yeah, what's up, Bowen?  Hey, another Mike.  Mike, you're on with Emily.  What's up?  I love fat chicks.  All right.  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, let me let butt out butt.  No, no butt.  He likes the butts, the bellies, everything.  That's what he means, no butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  No butt.  That's what he means, no butt. 
[11:00]
 No butt.  No butt.  No, the tits, the butt, I love it all.  I love it all.  Oh my God.  Wait.  Oh, what's going on?  Joy Brown, speaking of fat people, has this guy that has to be 800 pounds on a couch in  her studio right now.  Dude, is that a guy or a chick with a beard?  I'm serious.  800 pounds.  See for yourself, Joy Brown.  That's what we don't like, Emily.  It gets to that point.  But that's not all of us.  Are you going to lay in bed and eat until they got to pull you out with something they 
[11:30]
 load small mammals with?  No.  Large mammals?  No.  Oh, look at the audience clapping.  He's an inspiration to us all.  It's okay.  He's losing the weight.  Oh my God.  Oh, look, there's a big fat kid.  Fat kid on Joy Brown up next.  Fat kid to be mocked.  You know what happens to fat kids in the playground?  They get beat up.  Nobody plays with them.  Hello.  Hello.  Emily, you know what's going to happen?  Your daughter's 17. 
[12:00]
 You know how many good years she's got left?  She's only got a few good years left as far as young high school banging goes.  She's not going to get...  She's going to be going to the prom, right?  Emily?  Let's hope so.  Okay.  Do you want her to go into a prom dress all fat with the tops of her feet looking like  she's baking bread?  Excuse me.  I didn't say she was fat.  Excuse me.  Hello.  I didn't say she was fat. 
[12:30]
 That's your assumption.  No, she's obviously overweight, Emily.  Obviously.  Well, yeah, you're talking about it.  You said it.  You said, we're not skinny people.  No, no, no.  I said we're not built that way.  We're not tall, thin, leggy.  We're short.  You're built like a pear or a weevil.  No.  Emily, have you taught your daughter about bulimia?  Excuse me?  That might work.  Chris has some advice for you on line 9. 
[13:00]
 Chris?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  You got some advice for Emily?  Wait, she's short?  Let me guess, she's five foot all around?  I just want to come up to some of those people I see on the street and just slap to the doughnut  out of them.  Well, that's not nice, Emily.  You're a nice guy, too.  That's not nice.  I don't care.  I just cannot stand fat people going around and taking up all the space on the bus.  Yeah, that's a big issue.  That and the train, too.  I go up at school.  I try to go into the buffet line to get something to eat, and they're just sitting there and  they're just sitting there and they're just sitting there and they're just sitting there  with no food.  That's some real encouragement. 
[13:30]
 That's really encouraging.  It should encourage people to maybe lose a little weight.  That's all.  That's all, Emily.  We got rid of him.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny married a fat pig.  Oh yeah.  You married a fat pig?  I mean, yeah, she was, but she, you know, you kind of get used to it after a while.  She's kind of soft and everything like that.  You like move into it like a big pillow.  You ever yearn for the skinny ass, Danny? 
[14:00]
 Oh, absolutely.  You look at the chicks with the skinny little ass and you go like, God damn, what the hell?  I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a, I got  a, I got a hop in the sack with the, this thing is our ass looks like a big sack of  onions.  Hello, can I ask Danny a question?  Yeah, go ahead.  Danny, do you rag on your wife?  No, not at all.  I mean, she's great.  Not to a face.  Not to a face. 
[14:30]
 No, definitely not.  There you go.  Thank you.  No, I really don't.  I love it to death.  It doesn't matter to me.  It really don't.  But it's cool though.  We have a lot of fun.  Yeah, Danny, it doesn't matter to you, right?  Until you're out maybe at a strip club.  Until you're out at a strip club and you're looking at one of those asses, you know, the  way an ass is supposed to look.  I kind of hang with it.  It's all right.  All right, Danny.  All right, syndication now.  Thank you.  Danny, Danny's married to a fat chick and he doesn't mind.  I can't, hey Danny.  He's gone. 
[15:00]
 He hung up.  I wanted to know if he married her fat or if she got fat.  Didn't you ask that already?  Yeah, he said she was a little chunky.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, you're talking Emily.  Huh?  You're talking Emily.  Let's go.  Emily, what's up?  Hey, who's going to make the kids prom dress, Omar the pet maker or what?  Jesus Christ.  I won't even dignify that with a response.  Very good, Emily.  All right, no, I just busted shots.  No, hey, listen, listen.  I was about 128 pounds when I was going in to my prom night. 
[15:30]
 I was going to find out when I did it, but your phone sucks.  Oh my God.  Alright, Emily, I don't know what else to tell you.  Well, I hope our audience didn't insult you too much.  Like I said, that's what...  That's to be expected.  That's reality, though.  That's how people feel, though.  That's how a lot of people feel.  And I understand that.  I mean, there are people that enjoy larger women. 
[16:00]
 That's fine.  I personally don't like it.  It's like a freak show thing, though.  Oh, hold on.  See, now my daughter's all insulted over what they said about her prom dress, and it's not even like that.  Put that 17-year-old piece of ass on the phone.  Excuse me.  Go ahead. You do it.  Hold on a second.  Put her on the phone.  You want the phone?  Uh-huh.  I'll bang the fat right out of that ass.  Jack Hammer should be sweating.  He should be sweating like Tyson State. 
[16:30]
 Huh?  Are you going to be his?  Yeah.  I bet you are.  What's the lovely daughter's name?  Her name is Clara.  Clara.  Clara?  What are you?  What are you?  Abusive parents?  You even name them after cows?  Who the hell is...  Hey, wait.  Wait.  Hey, Emily.  What?  What family member was named Clara that you had to name your kid Clara?  My stepmother's sister.  I knew it had to be somebody.  What?  What? 
[17:00]
 You have pictures of you?  Why would you name a kid in this day and age Clara?  Well, hello, first of all, it wasn't my decision.  It was my husband's decision, and her name is Clara Jessica.  So everyone calls her Jess or Jessica?  Or CJ.  CJ.  CJ.  Why would you give someone a name where...  It's just like CJ from Baywatch, I'm sure.  Why would you give someone a name where they automatically have to come up with another  name so they don't have to use the real name?  Most people call her Clara.  Nobody's ever tried to call her that. 
[17:30]
 Clara.  That sounds like that Mayberry.  Isn't that the operator?  Clara, put me through to Barney.  Watch it, guys.  You're dating yourself.  Oh, please.  We've told everyone how old we are.  We're in our 30s.  Dating ourselves?  What, they don't show Andy Griffith on TV anymore?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Not that we want to.  No, you just stop at the Drake's commercials.  Are we done with Emily?  I want to talk to the daughter, man.  Your voice, Anthony, is like so disturbing.  What did we ever do to you?  This hate in your voice is like really disturbing. 
[18:00]
 What did some fat person ever do to you?  Did they kill your pet or something?  Let me think back.  You obstruct my view of the skinny chicks.  Put that daughter on the phone.  Hold on.  She needs a tongue lashing.  Let's play it, make Clara cry.  Hello?  Hey, Clara.  How you doing?  I'm fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you hot?  You mean am I hot? 
[18:30]
 You got a nice body.  You sound hot.  I got big boobs.  Well, I bet.  The problem is you got an ass to match, right?  How big are your boobs?  I don't know, Mom.  Can I say how big my boobs are?  Just got to ask a mom's permission.  Right out of permission.  This ain't a field trip, honey.  It's the 38C.  38C?  Baby's got a little belly.  Yeah, yeah, that's a little bit of a problem.  When you're 38, it should be a D cup.  Yeah.  That's okay, though.  You going to the prom?  Yeah, I think so.  You got a date?  Yeah, I do. 
[19:00]
 Oh, your dad's not busy that night?  Are you going to give him some action?  No.  You're not going to give him action?  Every guy wants action on their prom date.  I'm not like that.  I'm doing your prom, not my senior prom.  Are you going to drop some tonnage before the prom?  I've already lost some weight.  Why?  You have?  Yeah.  How much am I going to lose?  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.

I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I'm going to lose a ton.  I know, I've heard this show before.  No, I think you're pretty cool.  We're just messing with you.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Use a condom on your prom night there.  Did I put my mom on?  That lucky guy.  Yeah, I guess. 
[21:00]
 He's going to keep banging that big fat woman.  Alright.  Ed.  What?  You're so mean.  I'm fantasizing.  Alright.  Alright, bye.  Smack that ass.  Smack that ass.  Bye, Claire.  Big red handprint on a big white ass.  No, she's not white.  What?  She's not white.  She's black?  No.  What is she?  We're Hispanic.  Oh, nice.  You don't sound it.  Neither does Rick.  Huh?  Neither does Rick.  So you're a sorda-recon? 
[21:30]
 No, I am a new-year-recon.  Alright, well you guys sound pretty cool.  Yeah, well maybe.  Well now that she's got an excuse for the big ass.  Probably got a hundred pounds just in that ass alone.  What do you want us to do when we lose our way to go down in value or what?  Now that I made that father joke, it doesn't apply to the Hispanic family.  Do you have big boobs like your daughter?  Where do you think she got them?  About 80 times in the past half hour.  I'd check out your boobs. 
[22:00]
 Yeah.  Wow.  I like the big boobs.  I know you don't.  Are they all flat on top and stuff?  Well, no.  Unfortunately, gravity has taken a little.  What, what, what earths are your own?  That's a little gravity joke.  Come on.  Hey, you offered to pay for meds.  Come on.  Look, it shows I know about mass intensity.  Well, what's your size?  38 longs, 38 double D.  What do you get?  What are you sporting?  Sporting a 40D right now.  40D, huh? 
[22:30]
 Right now.  What does it change?  Well, I am, I told you I'm losing weight.  Don't lose them in those.  With a 44 double D.  That's cool.  That's cool.  When you get down to about 110 pounds, fly in here and see us.  A big gust and open up your bat wings.  You know what?  Hey, Emily.  If I'll ever get down to that weight, like I said, we're not built that way.  We're, you know, we're, I've always been a chubby little girl.  Hey, Emily.  What do you have between your breasts that your daughter doesn't?  It's not my navel.  It's not there. 
[23:00]
 I listen to you guys.  Maybe a little too closely.  I am a faithful listener.  All right.  We're going to go to the next question.  I am a faithful listener.  All right.  We don't want to piss off our faithful listeners.  But that isn't the answer.  Yeah.  That's why I'm wondering, why do you hate us fat people?  We love your show.  No, let's, honestly, we've got to move on.  Let's wrap it up by saying, honestly, we just make fun of everything.  I know.  Whether it's right or wrong, and we don't really care.  See, I hate putting a face to the fat because now I kind of like you.  Oh, thank you.  I like you too.  I was hoping not to.  Even though you feel bitter, but.  I like you.  Nah, we're fine.  I'm not bitter, you pig.  All right, Emily. 
[23:30]
 Hey, Anthony.  I'm teasing.  Come on.  Now that you're available, maybe you should try a chubby chick.  Yeah?  Yeah, maybe.  Like getting that ass.  Shoot a tray up in that piece.  They do try harder, eh?  You got a two by six that gets trapped in my ass?  Perhaps?  Honestly, you don't know what you're missing.  Really?  I've done a couple chubs.  You guys are fun.  Yeah.  You guys definitely try harder.  If you get a chubby chick, that's what you're missing.  Just got to make sure you have a blindfold on.  Oh, nice.  Oh.  You are just so nice.  I love you guys anyway. 
[24:00]
 All right.  So my daughter said thanks for talking to her.  She loves ONA.  You guys suck.  We like her.  You know, make sure she knows that.  She rules.  She was cool.  All right, Emily?  Don't I rule, too?  Yeah.  If you show your boobs, you will.  Excuse me?  Come by and show us your boobs.  We'll see.  All right, Emily.  You guys take care.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Emily.  Wow, look at that.  The chubby family.  Little chubby family right there.  The Chubsters.  Living in a chubby little house, in a chubby little bed, in a chubby little car. 
[24:30]
 It's the chubby family.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  More of your phone calls in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show for Tuesday.  February 29th.  Here's Dan Zing.  1027 WNEW.  Two songs, we'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2L that you guys won't stick to.  Dan Zing.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you. 
[25:00]
 We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.  It's the O&A show.  What's happening, man?  It's Tuesday.  How you doing?  I'm doing great, Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  Very good.  I'm hungry, though.  Yeah, I'm really hungry, too.  I think someone's got to get us lunch.  I didn't eat much. 
[25:30]
 I had like half a sandwich.  Place me and Opi went for lunch.  It was pretty good.  Had half a sandwich, though.  That was it.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  I'm going to go get some food.  Had half a sandwich, though.  That was it.  Anyway, on with the radio show.  Then we had a go.  What?  I'm talking about lunch.  I know you're talking about lunch.  I was...  I don't know. 
[26:00]
 Yeah.  What?  Oh, boy.  Why is everyone tuning in our show today?  I don't get it.  Hello?  Hello.  Why are you listening?  Nothing to see here.  Go away.  Move on.  Move on.  Shut up.  Why is everyone tuning in the radio show today?  It's kind of weird.  Phone line, 212-757-1027. 
[26:30]
 The fax line is 212-957-9639.  In all seriousness, someone's got to get Antonide lunch.  Our lunch plans got disrupted a little bit, and we're really hungry.  We could talk about the fact that we can't talk about the fact that we can't talk about the fact.  Yeah, we could definitely say that much.  That's twice removed.  We got to go inside jokes, please.  We got to move on with our radio show, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Moving right along.  It would be best to do that, right? 
[27:00]
 I think...  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Good afternoon, boys.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Good.  New York Radio Message Board.  Yeah, we talk about them all the time, yes.  Has you guys allegedly...  Allegedly...  Being thrown out of some press conference?  Oh, what happened to John?  What happened?  Why did they hang up on John?  I don't know. 
[27:30]
 Who was that?  Guys, chill out. You're going to get us screwed, man.  Yeah, please.  Oh, no John.  What happened? We were all having so much fun.  I'm really hungry, but Mellow Outguy, you're going to get us so screwed.  I'm starving.  Anyway, let's go to Brandon.  Oh, and hey!  Brandon, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  We're doing great.  How was RAW last night?  RAW was absolutely fantastic.  They rocked. 
[28:00]
 We were sitting ringside, like in the what?  Like the fourth row, Anthony?  Yeah.  We were sitting to the left of Jim Ross and the King.  Jim Ross!  And...  And...  I got to say hi to everyone we met.  Everyone was really, really cool to us.  We took a lot of pictures.  We shook a lot of hands.  Yes.  And we got to thank all the psychopaths for showing up at the garden last night.  It was just a ton of ONA-related signs.  I was looking for you.  Right before the Mick Foley tribute. 
[28:30]
 They looked on and we were guys looking for you, but we couldn't find you.  We couldn't see you.  Man, half the place knew where we were.  People were screaming from the other side of the garden.  Yeah, they showed one giant sign of 1027, Opie and Anthony.  One?  There was millions of them last night.  Well, there was one huge banner as they panned the crowd.  I particularly saw it.  Oh, know who that was?  That could have been Spazz.  That was Spazz.  He was getting on TV like crazy.  And also the guy on the runway, kind of, where all the wrestlers walk out.  We saw you, pal, and you should come on by the station. 
[29:00]
 We want to completely hook you up with a ton of stuff.  That guy was right on the ramp that the wrestlers walked down, and he had the biggest wow sign.  And he was shoving it right in the Rock's face when the Rock was walking up the ramp.  He was right on the ramp to the right when you're looking at the Jumbotron or whatever they call it there.  Can I ask two quick questions?  Yes.  Did you guys get to go backstage after all that stuff?  To tell you the truth, they invited us, but we didn't want to push our luck.  We had a ton of people from the WWF coming on over and saying hi to us and stuff. 
[29:30]
 We were quite flattered.  And we have an announcement on our show today.  The feud with the WWF is officially over.  Yes.  It's officially over.  They treated us really, really well and gave us a ton of tickets to give away to their upcoming events and stuff.  We made good with those guys.  You guys going to do any bits at WrestleMania for the show?  Well, they're flying us out to LA for WrestleMania, and yeah, we're going to come back with all sorts of stuff.  One last question. I'll let you guys go.  So what happened after they went off the air last night with The Rock? Did they just end or...? 
[30:00]
 No, The Rock kicked the crap out of Triple H.  Cool. Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Let's go to Mitch. Mitch, what's going on?  Yeah, Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  I met you guys today at the Howard Press Conference.  Oh, no. You guys are going to get a screw, man.  Oh, my God. Why?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Mitch, you're going to get us screwed.  Yeah. 
[30:30]
 Oh, man.  This is what I told a bunch of people around here. This is what was going to happen today.  I know. Anyway, phone calls.  Let's go on to Peter. Peter, what's going on? You're next on any W.  What's up, Peter?  Come on.  You.  He's listening to the radio or his name isn't Peter.  It's you, the one that's giggling.  No, it's Steve.  Steve? Well, we're talking to you, obviously. 
[31:00]
 I'm not going to correspond.  Well, it says Peter on the screen. What do you got?  Steve, yeah, guys. I saw you last night on Raw, about 1030.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there was right behind the booth a fourth row midsection.  Yes.  Yeah, there was a couple of big wow posters there.  Couple? I couldn't count all the wow signage that was at the Garden last night.  We've got to thank the psychopaths once again.  Yeah, they look kind of cool.  It was great. My favorite sign was, I love camel toe.  That was on TV a bunch of times. It was really, really funny. 
[31:30]
 Yeah, they were showing a lot of good spots over there with it.  Right.  Just throwing a prop for you guys. Good luck.  All right, Steve, thank you.  All right, take care.  It was a good Raw last night, too, huh?  Yeah, we had great seats, man. Got to thank WWF. They hooked us up.  Yes. Jeff from Rockville Center on the instant feedback, that giant 1027 sign, excuse me, held by spaz,  was given a full view right after they showed the McFauley match.  Yeah.  It was all over the place.  Great.  All right, and we got to regroup already.  How the hell did that happen? 
[32:00]
 We're going to have to get another phone screener because we like these jobs.  Whew. God damn.  Dude, chill. You're going to get us really screwed. That's all I can say right now.  Just chill the F.  Chill.  All right, we'll be back with more of your phone calls.  212-757-1027.  This is Opi and Anthony.  Jeff, can we get these illiterates off the airfield?  Please stop.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027-WNEW.  Opi. 
[32:30]
 Opi.  I have water retention.  Opi's on the rack.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Opi, you are such a woman.  Oh, come on.  Opi, we're calling any you wear.  Call me a fag, whatever.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man. Opi, you are such a woman.  Why am I such a fag? Why am I such a fag?  Usually I have to go to Christopher Street to see that.  I feel so sexy.  I'm a wimp. I'm a fag.  I like my vagina.  Opi, you are such a woman.  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today. 
[33:00]
 I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah. That's pretty gay, man.  I want to give Al Walker the rusty tuba.  Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky promo.  You got me.  Let's get working on a new CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  See what Fred Durst comes up with next.  Also one of my favorite bands heading into the studio.  New album out later on this year for Tool.  That enigma of a band. 
[33:30]
 Don't know much about Tool, but goddamn do they rock.  Cool.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world. 
[34:00]
 It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  It's the ONA show, 212757.  One of the best shows in the world.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, cool.  So he walks in with Ivory.  D-Lo and Ivory sitting at a table next to us.  D-Lo's woman, ugliest piece of ass you've ever seen in your life.  Ivory?  No, D-Lo's woman.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She had three chins, a big ass, and he was with two other blonde hair chicks.  Very nice.  How hot is Ivory in person? 
[34:30]
 Very.  Man, unbelievable, right?  I was sitting with a girl, with a girl with me, and we're watching, and I says,  Look at Ivory.  She's like, yeah, she's pretty hot.  Yeah.  I was like, come on, I'll drop the line.  We'll go over and talk to them.  Talk to them.  They were very cool.  Very cool.  Nice.  Then ten minutes later, here comes Rakesh and Too Cool and Dirt by Christopher.  Oh yeah?  They were over there, man.  It was a big party.  I felt like king of the world.  Was this after Raw or?  No, actually, D-Lo and Ivory, they stayed during the whole Raw.  Yeah. 
[35:00]
 And then Rakesh and the boys came in after.  Nice.  It was real cool.  Oh, well, very cool.  I'm glad you had a good time.  Yeah, she said, you guys, big ups to you guys, she said.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Ivory yesterday.  Oh, she enjoyed coming down.  We'll have to have her on again.  She was a lot of fun.  All right.  Peace out, guys.  Thank you, Tommy.  All right, bye.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, you're next on NAW.  What's going on, Paul?  Hey, you know.  Hey.  It's Fez.  It's Fez.  What is up with that show?  What, Ron and Fez?  Yeah, Ron and Fez. 
[35:30]
 One of our new shows started last night, Anthony.  Yes.  They were talking about how they know Opie.  He gave them a good greeting.  Well, I was a little hammered after Raw.  I came by the station, and I wished them good luck, sure.  Oh, they're terrible.  I was listening to my love line.  They're like, Adam Crowell will be right back.  And then Ron and Fez comes on.  Paul, Paul, you got to give people a chance.  You got to give people a chance.  The first, OK, the first day I heard you and that, right?  Yeah, you were talking about Patrick Ewing and his big nose, and he's a monkey. 
[36:00]
 It was great.  I'm not going to take that.  Yeah, really.  The first time I heard Tom, I'm like, OK, Tubby Tom sucks, but at least he's interesting.  Yeah.  These guys are horrible.  No, listen, man, you can't crucify him yet.  People crucified Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Well, they continue to crucify us, but no, in all fairness, you got to give all the new shows  at least a minimum of three months before they make your decision.  Believe me, if any of the shows blow, you'll hear it from us first.  Don't worry about it.  Listen, .2 slash suburban trash. 
[36:30]
 Come on, give them a chance, man.  I was listening on the way home last night, and for their first night, I thought they did a great,  great job.  And that's my God's honest opinion.  Oh, you were hammered.  Well, yeah, but no, man.  I'm sure anything sounds good on your hands.  No, you got to give them a chance.  No one gave Anthony a chance at first, so we're not going to be the ones that, like, you know,  trash them after their first day.  Yeah.  All right, well, just listen to suburban trash.  Three months into it, then maybe we'll start trashing, but come on, give them plugging suburban trash. 
[37:00]
 We don't hear you.  We don't hear you.  Oh, we got you.  Thank you.  Jesus.  We hope all our faithful listeners give all the brand new shows a chance.  Yes.  You know, we're completely into the Radio Chicks show.  Uh-huh.  We got a brand new show starting at 7 tonight.  Don and Mike, starting at 7 o'clock tonight.  Yes.  A much, much, much, much better show than Tom Likus.  It has to be said.  Come on.  A much, much better show. 
[37:30]
 What?  Compliments our show much, much better, and we are going to support them and give them  a chance to succeed here at any W, without a doubt.  Trying to build the station up.  We're going to support Ron and Fez.  We're going to support Don and Mike, and we're going to support the Radio Chick.  I didn't come in last night to say hi to Don and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  That's Mike.  Ron and Fez.  I don't know.  I can't even get the name straight yet.  Yeah.  You know what it's like for me, though?  Like, I was in the back, and, I don't know, it's sort of, this place has been like the  NOM or something. 
[38:00]
 You see people come in, you don't want to make friends with them.  You turn around, you just see the back of their skull blow out, and they're gone.  Yeah, you don't know.  I'm waiting.  I got to give it a little time.  Well, that's how it is with the salespeople upstairs.  Yeah.  I don't even bother to get to know the new salespeople.  No.  Because the odds are 70% of them are gone.  Yeah.  But Ron and Fez, I was listening, and I kind of wanted a computer in front of me.  Yeah.  You know, they start talking about a lot of online stuff.  I love going online.  They've got a good concept. 
[38:30]
 I guess their official time is going to be 11 to, I think, 3, is what I'm hearing.  And they've got a good concept.  You know, you hang out with your computer and you web surf with the guys.  You turn each other on to websites, and it was interesting for the first night.  It was something definitely different.  Yeah.  You know?  Definitely.  I kind of dug it.  I wished, like I said, I had a computer, because they were talking about that Voyadorm  thing.  I want to check that out.  I mean, anything's better than five hours of Love Lines. 
[39:00]
 Yeah.  Love Lines is fun to listen to for like 15, 20 minutes, but five hours?  Oh, my God.  How much can you talk about crabs?  Right.  You know, what's dripping out of places.  And a very sad day, Tom Lykus, officially not part of our radio station anymore.  Very, very sad day for us here at NW, if so.  Actually, maybe, I don't know, maybe we could take Tom out to Columbine style.  Okay?  In honor of Tom Lykus?  Yeah.  Come on! 
[39:30]
 See ya!  Bye-bye.  All he had to do was give us some respect, some recognition.  Show a little respect for the guys that have been through hell at this station.  Hell and back.  Amen.  But he chose not to, so.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Tommy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Jimmy!  Jimmy.  Ella?  You're up, dude.  Oh, what's up?  It's Jerry.  Jerry.  Wait, hold on. 
[40:00]
 Get Spaz in here.  Jesus.  He's got to start getting this straight because he's out of his effing mind.  Spaz, get these names right.  I'm trying.  I don't have heard Jerry.  I'm trying.  I didn't hear what you said.  It's Jerry, not Jimmy.  I thought I heard...  I thought I heard...  I tried to hear you.  Because these guys will not answer us unless we, like, got their name right.  But you got to figure this is Spaz.  Oh, that's better.  Spaz.  One more person gets the name effed up.  Another shot of toilet bowl water. 
[40:30]
 It seems to be the only thing that really works.  No, let's pick something different.  You really want me to pick something different?  Because I will.  You really want me to pick something different?  Because I will.  It might not be as tasty as toilet water, believe me.  It might entail something out on the street.  I don't want to drink anything or eat anything.  Well, then don't screw the names up.  Just get the names right.  Get the names right.  Because we look like idiots sitting here going,  Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, my name's Ron. 
[41:00]
 You're like, what?  So what's your name, man?  It's Jerry.  I listened around in bed last night, a little bit.  I thought it was pretty good.  I didn't listen that long.  I listened for about 20 minutes.  But I think you did a pretty decent job.  Yeah.  We'd really appreciate it if you guys gave all the new shows a chance.  Give them all a chance.  Like we said, if they blow, we'll have fun ripping into them until we boot their ass.  Exactly.  And believe it or not, I don't think Steve and Sue think this is the truth.  But we did give them a very fair chance. 
[41:30]
 Yeah?  We waited a really long time before we made our opinion on that.  And we're going to do the same with all the new shows that come in.  All right?  So be good.  Please be good.  Because we really want to stay here.  And if we don't get some shows that you guys really like, we're all screwed.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Take it easy.  All right.  Jerry, Jerry.  See, it says, sorry.  Bye, Jerry.  Bye.  Sorry about that.  All right, let's go to John.  John, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on today? 
[42:00]
 What's up, O.N.A.?  How you guys doing?  Real good.  Good.  You see page eight of the Daily News today?  Yeah.  We're going to have a match for two athletes, a tennis and a hockey star.  Oh, yeah.  Who'd it be?  Anna Kornikova is going to be fouled.  I'm not yuri.  She already is fouled.  She's a hockey twat.  What is with her?  Did you guys see what the restaurant owner said?  What?  They're going to have beautiful babies, beautiful, strong, fast, and perfect.  Good Arian.  You know, she was going out with that Sergey.  Federal?  Yeah. 
[42:30]
 That was only a little while ago.  Dumped him for another hockey player.  Imagine that out on the ice.  Yeah.  Her box has seen more action than these guys have seen on the ice.  That's another meaning into the crease.  You know, they're on the same team?  Yeah.  On the Panthers.  Oh, my God.  That's just got to be a little much.  They live in the same building in Miami Beach.  Yeah.  Yuri and Kornikova.  That's cool.  That's awesome.  Imagine having that as a neighbor?  Well, it's a very, very sad day for mankind in general. 
[43:00]
 You know?  It's almost as sad as the day we all found out that Pamela Anderson got pregnant.  Like we all had a shot.  Well, it's nice to dream, though, Anthony.  You never know, you know?  You like to think you might have a shot, a slight shot, but...  A shot at Anna.  Yeah, we saw that on the paper today, John.  All right, guys.  See you later.  Sell-outs.  That does.  Yeah, that does.  All right.  The sell-outs.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on any W.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you? 
[43:30]
 I've been listening to you guys for about two years now since I was in high school  and I'm moving to Georgia.  Me and my buddy were both moving down to Georgia.  And we want to say thank you for all the years of listening.  So we got a nice little Psycho Army plan.  Oh, what are you going to do down there?  Well, we're going to do it up here.  I've already gotten on TV with WOW before, but that was in another country.  Yeah.  So, can I say it on the air?  Yeah, hit it.  We're going to walk up and down the streets of New York with a gigantic WOW banner.  Oh, when are you going to do that?  Either this Wednesday or next Wednesday.  Do it this Wednesday.  Do it tomorrow.  Do it tomorrow?  Yeah, you can start the station.  Psycho Mark will go with you.  Okay. 
[44:00]
 We'll have like a little WOW parade.  We'll get others to do it.  All right.  All right.  What time should we be there?  Just show up around, I don't know, 2.30 tomorrow.  2.30 tomorrow at the station?  Yeah, we'll remember you.  Okay, my friend wants to say hi to you.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Thanks for all the listening.  I don't even know what to say now.  All right, well, have fun in Georgia, all right?  Yeah, you guys going to get syndicated for us?  We're trying.  Trying?  How about getting us going away on it?  No, I don't think that's possible.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  See you tomorrow.  All right, bro. 
[44:30]
 Can we get the radio chick in here?  We got to get the radio chick and Butchi in here, because I think she's responsible for  Kathie Lee Gifford saying she's quitting in July.  I was jumping up and down this morning.  I watched the Regis and Kathie Lee show every day, hoping she's going to announce she's  leaving that show.  And you can just tell by looking at Regis that it was the happiest day of his life this  morning.  He doesn't need her anymore.  He's got the ABC show. 
[45:00]
 There's rumors he's going to make some $20 million.  $20 million?  I don't need the whore.  And he was acting like he was really going to miss her.  No way.  They're going to get some young hot thing in there that's going to kiss Regis' ass.  You know what?  That doesn't tell all the stupid stories and all that crap.  Bye bye, Kathie Lee.  What is she going to do?  That's it.  She's going to fade into obscurity.  She's going to be some little answer on the You Don't Know Jack computer game. 
[45:30]
 She's convinced that she's going to be a Broadway star now, Anthony.  She had a little taste of Broadway and she really thinks that she's going to have to  be a star on Broadway.  I think she's going to whore her kids out to the porno industry.  That would be something.  What's up, Ben?  See you in Coyote and Casagy.  Yeah.  Getting banged.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on, man?  Scott?  Hello?  What's up?  You're on the radio.  This is Steve.  Jesus Christ.  All right, man.  Okay. 
[46:00]
 All right.  How do we know you didn't just say Steve?  Huh?  Spaz.  Well, what do you got for the show, dude?  We're not going to play this stupid game with Spaz today.  I wanted to talk about Kathie Lee.  All right, go ahead.  Well, did you hear her today on the phone?  She was quitting.  On the phone, on the...  I mean, on the show.  She said she was done in July.  Yeah, we did hear that.  I think that if you're going to have the parade tomorrow...  Yeah.  I want to join the parade and have a banner with wow  and having a... supporting her quitting.  All right, thanks, man. 
[46:30]
 That obviously was somebody who was just trying to get Spaz in trouble.  Well, we got to welcome the radio chick and Butchy on to our radio show today.  Look at this.  We're still bowing to them, Anthony.  This is like when the Jetsons were on the Flintstones.  It's kind of cool.  Isn't it?  I love it.  It's pretty funny, man.  Sort of weird.  Well, we're kind of cool.  Obviously, Butchy did the fine...  Well, you want to tell a story?  Because I'm here and we're getting all the details wrong.  The famous letterman started. 
[47:00]
 Yeah, she screamed at me after I was on with the guys Friday  because I told her too fast or I didn't tell it right.  Yeah, who had the gun?  Someone had the gun and then the hand grenades.  It was kind of assault with a deadly bra, more or less.  But, well, you heard the details the other day.  We actually were talking about Kathie Lee the day before on our show  and a listener called in and said we could have her tickets  if we would do something meaningful with them.  So we went and we got in line  and we tried to get a whole bunch of people online to help us.  Maybe we could recruit some help getting people to chant, 
[47:30]
 Cody, Cody, or put on a bra or something.  But you know what's in the audience for Letterman with Kathie Lee hosts?  Big fat ass pop-western women, midwestern housewives.  And the other people were a bunch of gay guys there to see Linda Etter.  So anyone we tried to recruit they were like, screw you.  We're really here to see her.  So then we became terrorists.  We're on our own.  And Butch had been fortified with what, Butch?  A couple beers and some Jose Cuervo.  That'll do it. 
[48:00]
 Yeah, I knew I needed a bottle.  Could you get them juiced up at a bar nearby?  Right next door.  Really?  Yeah.  That's really smart.  I've seen Butch under the influence.  He's a lot different.  A lot different.  That's right.  Well, there's a lot more courage when you have liquid knocks.  We all know that.  We all know that.  And so they have tight security there.  I mean, they know exactly who you are, what ticket number you have, what seat you're in.  They know every single person in that studio audience every night.  And it's like getting marched into a concentration camp when you get it. 
[48:30]
 There's so much supervision there.  So the Letterman show is like a concentration camp.  Like Auschwitz.  I've been there a few times.  She's 100% right.  You can't move.  You've got to stay single file.  And they watch everyone sit and it's a pain in the neck.  So we got seated in the middle of the aisle.  Then Butch said to me, we got to do the bra thing.  Well, somebody called earlier during the show and said, you ought to throw a bra at her  because everybody says she's not wearing one anymore.  She's trying to get attention.  So one of the listeners called during the day when we were talking about this,  before we even knew we had the tickets, and said, you ought to throw a bra at her. 
[49:00]
 So then when the booze kicked in and we're sitting in the theater, I said, yeah, you got to have,  there's nothing else we can do.  I'm going to have to throw a bra at her.  So give me a bra.  I checked my notes to make sure it was one I wanted to show.  I thought it was one of your old bras or something.  One of those creepy, you know, bad bras.  One you just wear around the house.  Right, one from like 1980.  So it was an okay bra.  And I had to take it off flash dance style.  And some old guy from Wisconsin was sitting right next to me wondering what I was doing. 
[49:30]
 So then I'm braless and Butchie has my warm bra in his hand.  But we were in the middle of the aisle.  That's rough.  So we had to keep trading with people two by two to move over.  And people were wondering why we wanted to sit on the end.  So the first, well, all of a sudden we're friendly New Yorkers.  We're like, hey, would you like a better view?  Come on here to the center.  Sure.  The next one, the next one pair of people, I said, you know, I always like to view things from the right. 
[50:00]
 Do you mind if we switch?  And they're buying it.  I mean, I never thought you'd get buying it.  Oh, yeah, I understand.  View from the right, sure.  And then the last one Butch turned to women and said, my wife is sick.  We might have to leave in a hurry.  Could we have the aisle seat?  Perfect.  Except she didn't sit in the aisle seat.  I did.  I'm not the one who's sick.  So then now I'm three rows from the stage.  Three rows from the stage on what?  Near the door?  The left side.  Yeah, right where the band is.  Gotcha.  And there's security lined up all on the edge and all along the front of the stage. 
[50:30]
 And I was a security on the edges, those pages, those college kids in sweaters.  What are they going to do?  Right.  And one of them was a girl.  And I looked at them and I said, I'll blow right by that.  You could take the girl out.  Yeah.  I just hit her with an elbow.  Not right punch.  Yeah.  Go right down.  So I knew they'd be no problem.  But the security guard, there were two and one was a big black guy, you know, standing  right at the edge of the stage, right next to the camera.  And I knew if I was going to get up there, I'd have to get around him. 
[51:00]
 Somehow I managed to do that.  Yeah.  And I was scared not only because I was scared for him, but I was cold and my nipples were  lazy.  You know, they keep that theater cold.  Yeah.  It's a problem.  How much you want to bet Anthony's going to have another dirty dream if I let him?  Oh, no.  Come on.  I'm looking at him looking at you.  Rick, turn down the heat.  Yeah, look at Rick's hypothermostatic.  Rick's turned down the heat.  We'll stall, Rick.  We'll get another 10 minutes of him.  Lock the door?  Yeah, lock the door.  So Butch rushed the stage through the bra, yelled, put on a bra, radio chick rules. 
[51:30]
 And it was like the raid on Aunt Tevi.  Oh, no.  And he was Hinckley and she was Reagan.  And the Secret Service were taking him down.  What was going on in your mind at that point?  I was really thinking, oh my God.  Holy cow.  You did it.  Yeah.  What did I get this boy into?  They're going to kill him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they took him and they, he makes light of this, but it looked nasty from my perspective.  They grabbed him.  A couple of burly guys grabbed him, pushed his face up against the wall. 
[52:00]
 Nice.  That's funny to the whole audience?  Yeah.  They grabbed me and pulled me back.  And those doors are right there.  You know, up you can go.  I know where the doors are.  And they go right out to the street.  The door letterman always goes out on the side there.  Exactly.  When he goes out to do those man on the street stuff.  And when they pulled me back, my face was to the crowd and everybody was looking at me.  And I told you this on Friday, they were horrified.  Like, what did he do?  What did he do?  Oh my God.  And then on Friday, there was something, I yelled Radio Chick Rules.  And then they pulled me out the door and shoved me right against the wall outside. 
[52:30]
 Not in the theater, but out in the street.  Yeah.  Where they could work you over without an auditor.  They really didn't though, because I didn't resist.  At this point, the hard part was over.  And I'd been in trouble enough times to know, don't fight back now.  What are you going to do?  So I just, I put my arms down by my sides.  Yes sir, no sir.  That kind of thing.  And eventually they realized I wasn't going to cause them trouble.  They just let you walk?  Well, no, they bawled me out for a while.  Well, they called the cops.  Yeah, they called the cops.  Yeah, New York City's finest had to come down, which really made me feel bad,  because I don't like to piss the cops off. 
[53:00]
 Sure.  Especially in this city, you know.  Yeah.  They'll shoot you.  But he disappeared for a while.  The security sat next to me and I had to hide my recorder and my nipples.  And what are you just like, did they ask you?  Did you know who that was?  About two more bars into her song.  She had then paused and picked up my bra and put it on.  And she didn't fill it out.  No, I noticed that.  And then I'm thinking, wow, what did I do to him?  And he needs bail money.  I got to get out of here and help him.  But I was trapped in by security.  So I tapped the security guy on the shoulder and I said, you know that guy, 
[53:30]
 that bald guy you just took out of here?  He's my companion.  Companion, that's good.  Not too much commitment there if they want to drag you in.  It could be anything.  Did you know he was going to do this?  How did you get in here?  Where did you get the tickets?  You know, look, I got to leave, I said.  They wouldn't let me leave.  But finally I prevailed.  And then I started running the streets looking for him.  And it's hard to run when you don't have a bra.  And I couldn't find him.  That's why you got black eyes. 
[54:00]
 I couldn't find him because they had taken him away.  And I didn't know whether to go to Midtown South or way out on the corner.  They just took me to the lobby, though.  They took me from outside.  They didn't want to make a scene outside on the street.  So they dragged me in the lobby and started lecturing me, you know,  what do you think you're doing?  There was kids in the audience.  It was a bra.  I think I've seen a bra before.  They told me it was trespassing, it was an automatic fine.  How is that trespassing?  I guess if you go on the stage, it's considered private property or something. 
[54:30]
 You weren't even on the stage, though, right?  Yeah, I was on the stage.  I got as far as there's a partition that surrounds the band.  So I got up on the stage.  Oh my God!  Yeah, and I got like this right in front of the partition.  I couldn't go any further.  So I just threw the bra.  It actually worked out well because if you've seen the video, it drops right at me.  It was perfect.  Well, after our road show, we were watching Kathie Lee with half an eye with the sound down  and also like, wow, someone threw a bra on stage.  Because we didn't hear you that day.  I had no clue you guys were doing it.  Right.  I thought it was hilarious. 
[55:00]
 And I thought it was...  We got lucky.  And just like everyone that probably called the show,  everyone thought it was a setup like the Letterman people set this little bit up.  Yeah.  But here's the kicker to the whole thing.  Here's the best part.  Before we go on the air this morning, Kathie Lee makes her announcement  that she's not going to continue with Regis and Kathie Lee.  Wait a minute.  I still get all choked up.  Okay.  And we get a call from someone we know works inside that show who said,  I don't want you to get too full of yourself, but the bra was a factor. 
[55:30]
 Oh, that bra.  You're my best friend now.  Apparently she's afraid for her safety, you know, so nuts like I can get at her, you know,  and for her kids, which she, you know, she should be more afraid of what she does  to the kids than somebody like me.  She saw Butch coming at her and freaked, and then afterwards thought,  why am I on the show where I talk about my personal life  and I owe myself up to be humiliated by mental cases like Butch?  And she was teetering anyway, but I swear to God, I'm told that the bra was a factor. 
[56:00]
 That's like slaying a dragon or something, you know.  You did it.  You're everyone's hero.  Yeah.  In this entire town.  How great is that?  I feel like we performed a public service.  Definitely.  Putting an end to like cancer.  You know, you guys are like Jonas Sahl with polio.  Jesus.  We got a call yesterday for someone that said the picture is in Time magazine.  Yeah, the bra.  Yeah, but there's no mention of us. 
[56:30]
 Well, that's still cool.  Oh, no, it's great.  The picture is everywhere, man.  Go figure.  They don't give credit to radio people for a gag or something.  Yeah.  We had a hard time.  I think maybe we'll get something out of it.  Now, actually, it's a good thing that she quit today.  The timing couldn't have been better.  It gives us, as you know, more mileage out of the story.  Yeah.  It lets us tell more people about it.  Especially now that we're credited.  It's about time.  I feel proud.  Yeah.  It sucks when you pull off something like that and don't get credited.  God.  It just pisses us off all the time.  Yeah.  Remember that when we shot the president? 
[57:00]
 He's some other guy.  But we can't thank you guys enough for helping us out, putting it on the website and talking  about it.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great story.  Radio Chick listeners.  You know what I'm going to do for you guys, too?  Hold on.  Because these guys hate this sweeper.  Oh, yeah.  Let me play it one last time.  We were playing this for a while.  Static.  Both B and N, B to the 7.  Then more static.  Oh, that's brilliant. 
[57:30]
 Look at you, O and A.  See, we were just meant to, you know, the morning being.  Radio Chick, I'm going to hand this sweeper to you.  Hand it over the cart?  Hand it over the cart?  That's it.  Now you can smash it.  We're all a team.  Smash it.  You can smash it in front of me.  Give me a piece of my own medicine.  I can't do it.  Well, those carts are pretty heavy, dirty.  Stomp on it.  Come on.  You're like a snuff film.  They could even be your ex or something, man.  Break it.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you.  Wow, that's just, uh.  We're officially at the clean table now. 
[58:00]
 I don't want to hurt anybody.  Here, let me, I'll show you what.  Here, give me that thing.  It's amazing.  You can bang those carts, stomp on them, and nothing happens.  But you can't do it.  I can't do it.  But you can bang those carts, stomp on them, and nothing happens.  But if the heads aren't clean, birds are going to go.  There it is.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  This thing will not break.  Get a hammer.  I don't want a hammer.  Oh, here, you guys.  Here, here.  You're asking Psycho Mark to get a hammer.  That's not a good idea.  My God, what is he having?  Protect your eyes.  This thing will not break. 
[58:30]
 That's amazing.  Thank you.  This thing will not break.  That's amazing.  Bionic cart.  Go ahead.  The thing will not break.  Oh, finally.  There we go.  Wow.  Who has a headache now?  Yeah, I know.  That's what I needed.  Well, guys, thank you so much, man.  Thank you.  Oh, no, thank you.  Bravo.  Just following your lead.  We bowed you.  I can't believe you killed Kathy Lee.  Hey, you know what?  That's great.  We're just the grasshopper.  You are the grasshopper.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We learned from you. 
[59:00]
 No, it sucks.  You're going to make us try to do something to top that now.  Please do, because I think I'm unofficially retired.  No, man.  You got a taste of it.  Now you've got to keep going.  I know.  It's a little like a drug.  You're going to have to...  Especially now that people are getting...  There's someone on the line that has tickets for Regis on Friday.  For the Millionaire Show?  You're going to have to go incognito, though.  You're going to have to grow hair.  You know we can't do anything like that.  Yeah, we're really not allowed to do anything like that.  We're not allowed to do anything like that.  We're not allowed to do anything like that.  We're not allowed to do anything like that.  We get thrown out.  All right, guys.  All right, thanks, guys.  The radio chick on before us, check out her show.  She's very, very good.  Thanks, guys. 
[59:30]

Paul from Rockland on the Instant Feedback. 
[61:00]
 Actually, it's Sky from Brooklyn. Sorry.  Sky from Brooklyn writes, if you want to outdo the radio chick,  you're going to have to have Rosie have sex with a guy.  Oh, yeah. That'll happen.  Not.  Let's go back to the phones if you got something.  212-757-1027.  Let's say hi to Max.  Max, you're next on the radio show. What's going on, man?  Hey, O&A, you guys suck today, really.  Thanks. 
[61:30]
 Hey, I got a couple of good news for you. A couple of things.  Number one, Kathie Lee. She has nothing to worry about. You know why?  Why?  She has that sweatshop business to fall back on.  Okay.  She has no problem at all. Come time when she leaves that show,  she'll fall back on that sweatshop business.  All that cheap labor, no problem. She'll be making millions.  Mmm.  And the other thing is, I mean, Kathie Lee was on Big Hell last night.  You get that?  Ah! 
[62:00]
 Was he trying to do like a monologue or something?  I think he was.  It seemed like he had jokes written out.  Don't you hate when Christopher Reeve falls on you?  You don't want Christopher Reeve falling on you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Ha, ha, ha.  God.  Oh.  You hear his delivery? He was reading jokes in.  I gotta tell you, how about that family?  I hear Pamela Lee and Tommy Lee are breaking up again.  Really?  Yeah, the latest National Enquirer has them separated again. 
[62:30]
 Really?  Yeah.  Has he been pounding on her or something?  Oh, they got a picture of Tommy Lee in Australia.  On a cell phone, supposedly talking to Pamela back in the States.  And there's like this girl next to him completely complimented.  And it looks like a recent picture.  Rock.  He can't drink or party in the States, so he's going elsewhere.  Yeah, he goes other places or else he gets arrested, right?  Yeah, and then they had Pamela having a picnic with her two kids  with an unidentified guy on the list.  I think it was the Enquirer. 
[63:00]
 The rag magazines are the best.  They get the story right before anyone else.  Yeah, no matter what they say, people get all pissed off at the Enquirer and stuff.  I don't know. That stuff comes true.  Yeah.  Let's go to TJ. TJ, what's going on today?  Hey, guys, I happened to check out Alan Smith's show on the internet  from the New York Radio Message Boy last night.  Yeah, I guess now he has a little radio show where he discusses radio.  Yeah, it's got to be the worst thing I've ever heard.  I actually made two out of the four pranks that were made last night.  Oh, people were pranking him? 
[63:30]
 Actually, there weren't that many.  There was maybe four.  I was listening from about 8.30 to about 10.  And there weren't a lot.  I got two on, though, and one was a fake name and one was my real name.  And I have audio if you guys want to hear him. I don't know.  Yeah, let's check it out.  Well, if you want me to stop at any point, just let me know, all right?  Well, I mean, do you got it cued up to the prank part?  Yeah, one bit's 42 seconds, the other one's like a minute and 30 seconds.  Look at this. I got a 42-second radio.  I have it on the computer, so.  Okay, let's hear it, TJ. 
[64:00]
 Here we go. This is the first one.  We have a loser on the line. Do we have TJ on the line? Good evening.  Hey, Alan.  Hello, TJ.  How are you doing?  I'm okay. How are you?  Pretty good. How do you feel now that you've been had by O.K. Anthony?  Oh, I thought so, too. I don't mind being had.  I don't mind being had. I've been had by a lot more than O.K. and Anthony, believe me.  But until O.K. or Anthony call me, I don't really think I've been had by them.  No.  Is there any truth to that fact?  Oh, come on, come on, TJ. You can come up with something quick here now.  Come on, TJ.  The pressure's on. You've got to try and take something from the real world. 
[64:30]
 I've been had by O.K. and Anthony.  You've been practicing this all afternoon, so here's your chance to try and get Alan to listen.  So let's go. Do this for one-liner. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.  Come on, TJ. Come on. Come on. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it.  What was that, TJ?  Oh.  That's the end of the conversation.  Come on!  The V.P. Tuesday Night What?  Hummer Club.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  That means Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.  Very long.  The problem, TJ, is it's a very large group.  It's a very large group.  And so to be a member of the Hummer Club that involves me involves women who have to really, really vocalize very clearly 
[65:00]
 because you need that kind of surface area.  You following me, TJ?  You with me on this, TJ?  Okay, TJ, you've been practicing all afternoon. I know you really wanted to get at me here.  So you've got to make a prediction now.  If we had a drum roll sound effect, I'd like to hear it now, please.  Alan, Alan, Alan, stick to Rue Canal's pile.  We'll be an Anthony fan for some of my favorite people to talk to. So that would be great.  Where you going? 
[65:30]
 Hi, TJ.  Guys, was that Tom Likens or what?  Wow, he's really taking that Tom Likens persona.  Yeah, I heard you say something about the dentist. That was my second thing.  I called back on John from Manhattan or something.  Yeah.  And I have that one if you want to hear.  No, we've heard enough.  Okay.  And Alan, trust me, we will not be calling your cute little radio show that 10 people listen to.  Yeah.  Ever, ever, ever, you will not hear us on your little radio show.  And guys, about half the teachers I had in my high school listened to you guys like religiously.  Okay. 
[66:00]
 And my math teacher came up to me and he told me that he heard me on the show a few times.  So in effort to help my low grade, I just want to say hello to Mr. Lynch.  Very good.  Talk to you guys later. You guys rock.  All right, a smart guy there.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right, bye. Let's go to Pete. Pete, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on?  Oh, I'm messing sick after what I just heard.  Why?  Oh, that whole thing with the Alan thing. Oh.  Anyway, payment time, I'm going to go to the office.  Okay.  The Alan thing, oh.  Yeah.  Anyway, Pam and Tommy, they're in the paper tape. 
[66:30]
 They're being sued by the ex-Masoos.  I read that too. The dog bit the Masoos on the ass or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, real quick. How gay was that thing at the wrestling?  With them dancing in the ring?  Well, with Rakeishi.  China and the Raheem.  Rakeishi and Y2J.  It was fun. I had a great time at Raw last night, I gotta say.  Yeah, real quick.  Come on.  Ah.  We're dying to know. 
[67:00]
 Pete, you suck. You're going to get a screw.  Come on. You guys got some clout. You think you can get down with trouble?  No, they're talking about it as we speak, so.  We have clout, but someone else has more clout than we do.  That's the problem.  We're going to screw the Jew.  No, that's the problem.  Take care, pal.  Some people can do it, but they can't take it. That's all I can say.  Don't worry about the Jew. He ain't nothing.  All right, Pete, thank you.  Take care.  All right.  Why does it always have to turn ethnic or racial?  My God.  We would talk about it if we truly believed that our jobs weren't in jeopardy. 
[67:30]
 Trust me.  Yeah, kind of want to stick this out a little longer, at least.  A little longer would be nice.  Oh, boy.  Well, look at that. We got to take another break now and get another phone screener.  We've been through two today already.  My God.  We gave the bosses our word that we wouldn't be talking about what happened today.  Yeah.  All right, we'll be back. Stay there.  O.B. and Anthony.  This is debauchery mania. 
[68:00]
 Frosted exams for everyone.  One one one oh two seven WNEW.  O.B. and Anthony.  Those guys are fast.  One oh two seven WNEW.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven.  What's that?  What's that?  Back line two one two nine five seven nine six three nine.  Let's see if the new screener is going to do a good job here.  Anthony, what's going on on the phone line there? 
[68:30]
 Anthony, what's up?  Yeah, that guy Alan Siffey is still saying these guys are going to morning.  And we're going to morning?  Yeah.  We're not going to morning.  Sorry.  Yeah, and I've got something for you.  What?  Anthony, what the hell is wrong with you?  What?  Are you fucking insane?  We're here to watch your mouth. What are you talking about?  A hundred grand?  What do you mean what am I talking about?  Yeah, we are testing new owners, man.  We are testing new owners.  Oh, there's an old bit.  There's a voice that doesn't want to hear.  Well, where did you get that from? 
[69:00]
 That was from Boston.  Yeah, when we gave away the hundred grand and then.  Somebody called old Matt at me for going along with the bit that you came up with.  Because they didn't want you to get fired.  Yeah.  Okay, that's good.  That's good.  All right, let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys.  This show is a mess today.  What's up, Tom?  It really is.  You guys got to talk about what it is that you can't talk about.  Freaking people.  I told the bosses this would happen to them. 
[69:30]
 Yeah.  I hope they understand that we're just trying to do our radio show.  Yeah.  Go to Chunk.  Chunk.  Yo, ONA, my two new favorite whores.  What's up, man?  What's going on?  It's not freaking America where you guys can't talk about this.  Yeah, but within America, there are things such as, I don't know, institutions or corporations  that you are in that are not a democracy.  Yeah, I understand that.  But it's better to hear it from the horse's mouth than to read some fabricated story. 
[70:00]
 From the horse's mouth?  The horse.  It's really no big deal, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  The bosses.  I don't think it would seem out to be this big deal.  Rick, go ask Jeremy, our new boss, if it's okay to talk.  Will do.  Hey, real quick.  I appear every weekend at exit 17 on the Turnpike every Saturday and Sunday.  And this Friday, I'll be with the Dice Man at Chavity Hall and Bayonne and the Knights of Columbus.  Thank you, Chunk.  Peace.  Peace.  All right, Anthony, Celine Dion's suing the National Enquirer. 
[70:30]
 For what?  Remember, we reported, I don't know, it had to be about a month and a half ago that Celine Dion was pregnant with twins, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, she's suing the National Enquirer for $20 million, alleging it said she was pregnant with twins.  She was pregnant with twins while knowing the story was false.  Really?  Yes.  Pregnant with twins?  And she's, oh, she's not.  She's not pregnant.  The National Enquirer said she was pregnant with twins.  The story was false.  Celine feels like, well, you know what? 
[71:00]
 I deserve $20 million for that.  Oh, man.  Like she needs it.  $20 million.  Well, they've been having a problem, her and her husband.  What's that husband's name?  Renee.  Renee.  Renee.  I've been having trouble getting me pregnant.  Well, we could play it from the ONA archives.  Yeah.  Remember that one.  When we announced that Celine was pregnant with twins.  Uh-oh, I hope we don't get sued. 
[71:30]
 Well, we were just reading about what we read in the paper.  Yeah.  So I think we're safe.  I hope so.  But I guess this story is now false.  Celine Dion suing the National Enquirer for $20 million.  And that is a no from our new boss.  OK.  We got to regroup.  What, Rick?  Exact words.  Stay the course.  OK, we're trying.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Let me pray.  All right.  From the ONA archives. 
[72:00]
 Yeah.  When we found out that Celine was pregnant with twins, even though it's not true as we're finding out today.  Anthony, did you read about Celine Dion in the paper today?  Yeah.  Everyone waiting for our comments on Celine Dion.  It's being reported in the papers today that she is pregnant with twins, Anthony.  Woo!  Now, one paper is saying that she's pregnant with twins.  The other is saying it's false.  It's not true.  I would like to think that it is true and that Celine Dion is pregnant with twins.  Twins. 
[72:30]
 Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, did they freeze her husband's sperm or something?  Did you see that?  He has cancer, so they froze his sperm, and she was impregnated with her husband's frozen sperm.  Yeah.  I guess because what kind of cancer does he have that he can't just give her the high, hard one and do it that way?  Well, they wanted to, you know, make sure they were going to have kids.  Right, with no good.  Wow, that's something. 
[73:00]
 His sperm live on.  I am pregnant.  Finally.  We have been trying for so long to get pregnant, and finally my husband's sperm slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty Titanic slammed that iceberg, splitting it open and fertilizing an egg to make another Celine, hopefully.  Hopefully my legacy will live on, as will my camel doll. 
[73:30]
 What?  It is such a happy moment for my 58-year-old husband, René, when he found out I was pregnant with twins.  Do you know twin hippos could fit side by side in my camel doll?  But these are just twin babies.  All of the sperm that was swimming around in the icy waters of my uterus. 
[74:00]
 You know, most of them die.  Yeah.  Most of the sperm never make it.  They die there in the icy waters of my uterus.  But two, two sperms lived on, swam, swimming, using all of their might to find the egg, the egg to cling to.  These sperms are the ones that fertilize the eggs.  While the others died, these sperms were true survivors. 
[74:30]
 You know, my twin children can grow to adulthood and still fit out of my camel doll.  That huge crevasse between my legs.  You should sing. 
[75:00]
 Do you know the reason it had to be artificial insemination?  No, why?  They say because René has cancer, and they froze his sperm and put it in.  But the truth of the matter is, he could not even feel the sides of my mighty camel doll.  I am so huge.  He kind of slammed it against the side a couple of times, but it did not work.  So they made a sperm popsicle.  Now this frozen sperm, was it as blue as... 
[75:30]
 As blue as the Caprio at the end of Titanic?  Yes, that's what they looked like, this sperm frozen like Leo at the end of Titanic.  My sperm will go on. 
[76:00]
 It was like having an ice pop in there, the frozen sperm of my husband René.  But I can have twins now.  And I will dress them in little jumpsuits to show off their tiny little camel toes.  Just like mommy.  My camel toe will live on.  My camel toe will go on. 
[76:30]
 Alright, it's a happy day for Celine and René.  Yes, congratulations Celine.  Pregnant with twins.  Boy, that's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out.  Alright, Celine hop up on the table.  Alright, why don't we take a look of...  Oh my...  Look at the size of that. 
[77:00]
 Let's just...  Oh, hello.  Echo.  Celine, wow, you got a lot of room in here.  Yeah, let me...  You know, I don't even need instruments.  I'm just going to crawl right in and take a look around first hand.  We don't need a sonogram or anything.  Wow, here deep inside Celine's womb.  Look at the size of this place.  Is anyone in here?  In here, in here, in here.  Manoquillo. 
[77:30]
 Manoquillo.  Birds freezing in here.  It's like a Venus fly snatch.  You got to watch out.  Scoop me right up.  Where the hell's the light switch in here?  It's pitch black.  Oh my God. 
[78:00]
 Goddamn.  What's that, trout?  I'm going to climb way up here.  Yeah, I could open up a water park in here.  People could just slide right back down.  Wherever you are.  I'm playing the snatch flute. 
[78:30]
 Wow.  Oh my God.  What is that?  Oh my God, it's a T-Rex.  What the hell's that doing in here?  Let me just walk over here.  Oh my God, this is disgusting.  Who the hell's that sitting there?  Buddy Edson, what are you doing in Celine's womb? 
[79:00]
 Oh my God, look, it's that little Kitner boy from John.  He wasn't a shark after all.  You're swimming, you got sucked up by Celine's huge cage.  Another walk over here.  You can see what's in here.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, hey, how you doing?  All right, we're just going to go for a little pap smear here.  It might feel a little pressure.  There we go.  I've got to get enough of that. 
[79:30]
 Wherever you are, I believe.  All right, I've got to get out of here.  Oh my God.  This place is huge.  Oh my God, I'm so excited.  Oh my God, it's coming right for us. 
[80:00]
 I don't even know what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Oh, very good.  I've got to do a little bombing.  I see a light.  Oh my God, it's a tractor trailer in Celine's womb.  Oh, there it is.  There's the little baby.  Look at the camel toe. 
[80:30]
 Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please?  I'm going to get out of here.  I'm just coming out to the exit here.  What's that like around the corner?  Oh, it's a lisp.  I feel much better.  Hey, it's coming after me. 
[81:00]
 Is that an Apache attack helicopter?  All right, well, there you have it.  Celine having the twins.  Congratulations to Celine and her husband there.  Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcast from, Celine's womb.  Elizabeth.  Yeah, why don't you guys diss someone who deserves to be dissed? 
[81:30]
 What is your problem, man?  How old are you, Elizabeth?  That's irrelevant.  We're in the middle of a commercial break.  What's your problem?  I think why don't you guys make fun of someone who deserves to make fun of?  Like Backstreet Boys?  Elizabeth, how old are you?  No, why don't you make fun of...  Are you pissed off because you just made fun of Celine Dion?  Yes, I am.  I am a huge fan of your show.  I've been listening for a long time.  Blah, blah, blah. Why are you defending Celine Dion?  No, no, no. You guys are so cruel. 
[82:00]
 And why don't you guys pick on someone?  Do you know anything about her?  She at least has been honest about who she is and where she comes from.  Not like other people.  Honest?  Yeah.  That husband of hers had an eye on her when she was like 13.  Right.  Don't you find that disgusting?  Yes, I do.  But the record executives made them be quiet about it.  And I do think it's disgusting.  What?  I don't think he was diddling her when she was 13. 
[82:30]
 How do you know?  I don't know.  I think that whole story is disgusting.  Relationship is a little questionable.  Yeah, he was in his mid-30s.  She was like 13 when he first met.  And like everyone has been having a hard time with relationships,  come on, guys.  Why do you make fun of someone who is weak?  Elizabeth, shut up.  We're in no mood to listen to you today.  No.  We're in no mood.  You're obviously not a fan of our show.  I'm a huge fan of your show, but you guys really... 
[83:00]
 We crossed the line by making fun of Celine Dion?  Yeah. No, you just...  You know what?  The whole WWF thing that you guys pussy out and gave in  and went through the show pissed me off.  I've got to ask you how old you are.  Come on, tell us.  Why? Why do you care?  Because I'd like to know if you're a very stupid adult  or a very intelligent kid.  Why am I stupid?  Tell me why I'm stupid.  Because I don't understand why you're sticking up for Celine Dion  of all people.  I'm sticking up for people.  You know who I really want you guys to make fun of? 
[83:30]
 Linda.  Yes.  Talk to Elizabeth.  Just shut up.  It's a radio show.  Get a grip.  I am so cool and chill.  That's not the point.  These guys just...  I don't know.  Today they just pissed me off.  It's a show.  You're like 13, right?  No, I'm 9 1 2 actually.  Why do you let the children on the show?  She's about 19.  Really?  Yeah.  Elizabeth, how old are you?  19, right?  You can just keep guessing. 
[84:00]
 Linda, what do you have for Elizabeth?  She's got to get a grip.  She's a public figure.  If you guys want to make fun of her, Celine can deal.  Yeah, please.  I'm sorry.  She annoys the hell out of me too.  I'm not saying she annoys me.  It doesn't annoy me.  I'm saying that these guys...  Boy, Celine, can you punch your chest one more time for me?  Just go off on...  Why don't you go uncover Rosie's past and just stop on Rosie?  Thank you, Elizabeth.  We've messed with Rosie.  We've messed with everybody.  I know.  Okay, you know who you should mess with?  Mariah Carey.  Mess with Mariah Carey.  Stop it.  We've messed with her.  We've messed with her.  We've messed with her.  We've messed with her.  She's a sloppy trash. 
[84:30]
 She's a sloppy trash girl.  We've talked about it.  Sure.  She's from my high school and we've talked about it.  What else?  I want you to do a whole bit on her then.  If you're going to get...  Give fair play to people that...  Why the obsession with Celine Dion?  Do you want to munch her pots or something?  I am not obsessed with her at all.  I don't even...  You want to bump donuts with her?  What's the deal?  I don't even want to...  You want to bump donuts with her?  What's the deal?  I don't even want to...  You want to bump donuts with her?  I don't even want to...  You want to bump donuts with her?  I don't even want to...  You want to bump donuts with her?  I am not obsessed with her at all.  I don't even want to...  You want to bump donuts with her?  What's the deal?  Yeah, that's it.  You figured me out. 
[85:00]
 You want to bump donuts with that skinny bitch?  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  With that camel toe?  You're right.  You like the camel toe.  What is your problem?  I need to know what your problem is today.  You guys just piss me off today.  You want my camel toe, don't you, Elizabeth?  Elizabeth, we're in a bad mood to begin with today.  We don't need your crap.  Come on, guys.  I listen to you.  Put on a strap-on and slam into me like the mighty Titanic slammed into the mighty dark.  You know, you would...  Elizabeth, there's too many people too many times. 
[85:30]
 Elizabeth, are you on the rag today?  Yeah, that's what it is.  They got a heavy flow today?  Yeah, that's what it is.  You're flowing like the water was flowing into the watertight compartments of the mighty  ship.  I shouldn't like you guys to be silked.  That really is what it is.  What type of tampons do you use?  No, because people listen to you.  You use the big pads, OB, designed by women gynecologists, no applicator.  You use your finger.  What kind are you using today?  Elizabeth, do you have seagulls following you today?  Are you flying on the wings of a maxi?  I don't even...  I don't understand why you're so angry over stupid Celine Dion dead. 
[86:00]
 It's not just Celine Dion, guys.  I'm trying to make a point to you that it's just...  You're nodding your head.  Why don't you talk about something of substance and then go off about it?  We talked about the whole Diallo case.  What kind of news is it that Celine Dion...  We talked about addiction yesterday with Daryl Strawberry.  Talk about Diallo.  Go off on...  Talk about...  You don't even know what's going on in small burbs about Diallo.  There is a wake.  There is an aftermath coming to this.  White kids, white middle-class kids are picking it up.  I'm going to take the train.  You guys pick me up tonight. 
[86:30]
 You go for listener.  I'm going to try and I'm going to go again.  That's it.  Elizabeth?  Yes.  Go to hell.  Thanks, Alphys.  There she goes.  She's all upset.  Hang up.  Bye-bye, Elizabeth.  You're awesome.  Hang up.  Bye-bye, Elizabeth.  You're on the rag today.  It'll pass, okay?  Yeah.  You'll call and apologize.  No, I won't.  Yes, you will.  Elizabeth, I've got to hang up.  Tom Green's on the line.  Much more important person than you, you bitch.  Tom Green!  Hello? 
[87:00]
 Tom?  Tom, is it you?  Yeah, how you doing?  Is it you, Tom?  What's happening?  Are we on the radio right now?  Yeah.  We're on the radio, Tom.  We're actually on the air.  Hey, I almost got your voice down.  What's up, bro?  We're big fans.  Oh, wow.  Thanks.  That's exciting.  You know, I'm excited today.  Do I sound excited?  Yeah, you do.  You sound very excited, yes?  I'm excited because we have this big special on our show tonight.  Yeah, I know.  You've got Monica Lewinsky, I hear.  Yeah, it's, you know, yeah.  Did you get a Hummer offer?  What's that?  Did you get a Hummer?  Did I get a Hummer? 
[87:30]
 Yeah, you know, a Hummer?  No, we didn't get a Hummer for this one.  If you're that close to Monica, you should get, you know, whip it out.  See if she'll hobbit.  Did she get my Hummers or what?  No, she didn't get a Hummer.  She got a Hummer.  She loves it.  I didn't even know she liked Hummers.  See, I screwed everything up.  I didn't even know that.  Not the vehicle, Tom.  We don't have like a lot of sort of, we don't have a budget for like researchers.  We didn't even know she liked Hummers.  And I'm still diminished.  It looks like you don't have a budget for much on that show, but we love it, man.  We're just going to, you know, make it up as we go along.  What's the term they use in Canada for a BJ?  See, in America, we like using Hummer.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  I've never even heard that term before.  What?  What?

 What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK, out of the way.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  OK, you got it right.  OK, you got it right.  No, I don't.  I'm trying.  Say it again.  No, I'm trying.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK, OK.  OK, OK.  OK.  OK. 
[102:00]
 OK, OK.  OK, OK, OK.  OK, OK.  OK, OK.  OK, OK.  OK, OK.  OK.  Tick, tick.  Tick.  The sickest Tom Green episode when he was sucking on the cow udder.  And it looked like a guy's thing, man.  Yeah, it looked like he was doing the deed.  I'm very surprised MTV allowed us to talk to Tom Green with all the abuse we sent their way.  Maybe they forgot. We better remind them.  Maybe they know who reaches the 18 to 49 male demo. 
[102:30]
 Explain it to them.  Alright, let's go to Karen. Karen, you're on NAW. What's up?  What's up, Opie and Anthony?  Hello.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Um, Opie, I saw you on the wedding on Friday and I was going to ask you, I kind of chickened out because Sandy was standing right there.  Uh-oh.  But I wanted to ask you about lesbian for a day.  You want to be lesbian for a day?  Yeah.  This girl is hot, Anthony. I was at this wedding on Friday, my cousin's wedding.  Mm-hmm.  Really? I didn't know you went there.  She related.  Opie was kind of a wall-stock flower a little bit. He didn't really dance that much, but he was kind of crass because of the road show, I guess. 
[103:00]
 I was exhausted at that wedding Friday.  I was surprised I was still on my feet. I danced one dance.  You had like 30 seconds.  Well, I didn't even talk about the wedding, Anthony.  Yeah.  My cousin Jimmy's wedding on Friday. It was a great time there in Smithtown. I was really, really tired.  Mm-hmm.  But it's really, there's a couple things I want to mention. First of all, to my relatives.  Yeah.  You've known me my whole life. You don't have to sneak pictures of me to bring back to like your coworkers. 
[103:30]
 Just ask me and I'll take a picture with you.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Do you have that happening at like distant relatives and stuff?  No, most of my relatives will just drag me over.  My cousins and stuff will put me in my place anytime, and my uncles. But it's like the distant relatives that I see maybe, I don't know, every five years.  Snapping pictures.  I'm eating some of the wedding cake and stuff and all of a sudden I see a flash.  My brother goes, you see that? Uncle Wunt-Wunt is like sneaking pictures of you. I'm like, why is he sneaking pictures of me? Just ask. I'll take a picture with the guy. 
[104:00]
 Yeah.  So that was going on. And then I got talked into going on the dance floor to do one dance with my 90 year old grandma.  Oh no.  We had the cute grandma dance where she was dancing on the dance floor, Anthony.  And then all the...  And then...  I have to speak in obvious defense. He did not do the electric slide or anything like that. So I'm just sticking...  Karen, did I do any of that?  No, he did really seriously only dance like 30 seconds to a minute. 
[104:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah, and that was just for my grandma. She's gonna be 90 in like two months. So they thought it'd be cute to get all the grandkids dancing around grandma.  Ah, there you go.  So I did that for a little while, but they started the conga line.  Yeah.  And a bunch of people were laughing at me because they all know how I feel about that stupid dance.  Yes, the conga line.  And they had to take it out of the reception hall, the hallways and stuff.  The conga line's wacky. It's going out into the hallway. Look, oh no, it's in the kitchen. 
[105:00]
 You have to admit that DJ was pretty good.  Yeah, he was cool.  He was alright.  He was alright.  Did the DJ come and talk to you?  No, no, no.  That was pretty good. He was really, really loud though.  Yeah, he was.  He needed to turn down his microphone just a little bit. We could hear you quite nicely there.  Yeah.  When I was the best man at Joe Curry's wedding, the DJ comes over and he gives me the mic for the speech and goes,  Here you go. Try to hold it a little bit away from your mouth and tip it down a little. 
[105:30]
 I'm looking like, dude, I think I know how to use a microphone.  It's like, thank you, Skippy. That's like my job. I don't tell you how to put the damn fry-olator basket back in the oil.  So Karen, you want to be a lesbian for a day, huh?  Sure, why not?  You want to come down here so Ann can get a look at you?  Now.  Why, you're close?  No, I just had some work to do but I can put it off.  So you're not a relative, is you?  No, I'm his cousin's best friend. 
[106:00]
 Oh, I thought you were doing my cousin.  No, no, no. Actually, I'm doing his other friend.  Oh, wait a minute. You're doing Ope's cousin's friend?  Okay, so no, there's a long story.  But you go to the wedding with the cousin?  Anthony, there's a long story there. I actually met Ope's cousin on the internet of all places.  Who, Michael?  Yeah, Michael.  What, is he a serial killer, Ope?  Well, he is.  He's been in here?  He's been really into that. He has like five screen names and stuff and he goes and tries to pick up chicks.  Oh my God, the internet. 
[106:30]
 He's definitely related to it.  He gave it up. He gave it up when he went to the Navy. He can't do that anymore.  He's stationed in Chicago now, Anthony.  Ah, he's in the Navy.  So he picked you up on the internet?  Yeah, he picked me up on the internet, right?  And then like I meet his best friend like a month later and I start going out with him.  Actually, I broke up with Michael to go out with his good friend.  They're not friends anymore because of me, but whatever.  Did you hob my cousin's knob?  Yeah, actually I did.  Oh, wow. 
[107:00]
 He's probably going to like listen to this. I don't want to be like...  I'm making tapes to send to...  Oh, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are.  If he misses the show, I'm going to send a few tapes to Chicago.  Okay.  You really hobbed his knob?  Well, I was dating him for like a month before I met Matt, his other friend.  And then what happened with this Matt guy all of a sudden?  I'm actually still with Matt and it's going to be I think a year and three quarters.  No, but I mean like all of a sudden you met Matt and then what made you stab Opie's cousin in the back and go off with Matt? 
[107:30]
 No, actually the relationship wasn't really going anywhere.  We just kind of like... we liked each other, but there wasn't anything happening.  Does my cousin have the family blessing?  Ah, I don't know. I haven't tasted any other family members, so I really wouldn't know.  No, I mean like the family blessing. How big is he?  Oh, he's... I don't know. In my experience, average.  There you go.  I'm not an expert. I feel like more than average. 
[108:00]
 And now with the new guy, have you given up the balloon knot for him?  Actually, yeah.  Alright.  I'm making a tape right now to send to him. He lives in Long Island and I live in the city.  So we all get to see each other. So in honor of the Tuesday night hummer, which he never did, I figured I'd be lesbian for a day.  Very nice.  Give up the balloon knot. This girl's giving up the balloon knot, man.  She's a whore.  And she's hobbied my cousin's knot.  Not all the time. Maybe like once or twice. 
[108:30]
 Special occasions kind of.  Yeah, that's a special occasion.  Special occasions like Christmas and leap year, which is today, so get your ass down here.  Yeah, it's kind of like turn around, honey. Hey, why not?  Groundhog's Day, you see if it pops out, have a shadow or something.  Well, very nice. Yeah, you can come on down.  Alright, cool.  Be a lesbian for a day.  Okay, awesome. I'm going to need your actions, though.  Your actions? Why?  Yeah, I'm going to need your actions in the studio.  You'll have enough erections. 
[109:00]
 You know what? I mean, this show is going nowhere fast today. If you want to get down here today, we'll set up lesbian for a day tonight.  No problem.  Alright, if there's any girls out there, I did see this girl Karen at a wedding last Friday. She's definitely cute.  She's got some big fun bags.  Oh, thanks, Opie.  Yeah. What size?  It depends because I go in and out, but I'm like 36 feet to 38 feet.  Alright. How tall?  Five-nine.  Karen, I've got to be honest. Someone smelled really bad at the wedding. 
[109:30]
 You're not implying, are you?  I don't know. Did you have a little odor going on?  Actually, I don't have a sense of smell.  What?  I wasn't born with one.  You weren't born with a sense of smell?  I wasn't born with a sense of smell. I died. Defective olfactory. Whatever. He explained it to me a long time ago.  Okay, that was not great. You wouldn't even have to shower.  If it was me, I'd apologize, Opie. I'm sorry.  That would make sense.  I don't think it was me. I showered and I deodorized.  You could just blast farts in front of her and she wouldn't know. 
[110:00]
 You can't smell anything?  I can't smell anything, dude.  So...  There's only one thing I can smell. I can smell a room filled to capacity of smoke.  And then if a house is burning down, I'll know it.  But I'm hopeful that it's not because I've never kicked in before.  Hey, screw the lesbian for a day. Someone go out and get some White Castle, man. This is more fun than doing lesbian.  So, like, when you cut one, you know, when you blast...  I don't want to cut one. I have no idea. 
[110:30]
 No, but if you do, you don't even know what it smells like when people are going, oh, that's terrible.  You've never smelled anything in your life?  Never smelled anything in my life.  So you don't even know what it is to smell?  Nope.  Do you taste stuff?  Yeah, see how it works is, like, the part of my nose that would work when I smell is defective.  So, like, everything else works as if I have smell, but when it's... I'm supposed to smell, it doesn't work.  I wonder if she gives up the balloon knot. That area is nothing for her.  Well, guy, girl, it doesn't matter. It's all the same to her. 
[111:00]
 You obviously would have no problems giving hummers then.  Rusty trombones. Rusty trombones you could pretty much go for.  I've actually never done that, but...  Oh, wow. You're holding out.  I'm holding out.  Well, all right, let's try to set you up. Any girls out there want to go out with Karen today on the lesbian couch?  How old are you? You're like 20?  20.  20. I was going to say 21, 22, yeah.  Yeah, I couldn't go on the road trip. I wanted to come out, but you don't do anything cool for us. 
[111:30]
 20 years old with no sense of smell. That's great.  Well, so far we have no takers, Karen. I can't understand that.  Aw, man.  She's definitely cute. She can't smell.  Do you get, like, handicap plates for that or something? That seems like something that's kind of a handicap.  Yeah, we should have her smell stuff that we would never smell.  Yeah. All right, well, I'm someone who just blasts one right in their face. Rick will do it.  All right, Karen, hold on the line.  Okay.  All right, we're trying to get lesbian for a day happening today. The lesbian couch hasn't had a workout in a while. 
[112:00]
 I bet Stinky wasn't here.  Karen is definitely a good candidate.  She could rub his armpit in her face.  She sounds like she'd be a lot of fun. Any ladies in the area that want to come on down, we want to try to make this happen today.  All right. Rock. I can't read that, Rick.  You can read that.  Let me see your writing.  Just over the top. Chris from Jersey on the instant feedback.  Oh, Rick.  I believe what Rick is trying to say is that with Karen having no sense of smell, hygiene isn't much of an issue with the girl if she wants to come down here. 
[112:30]
 Oh. Well, she came over with a bunch of friends to meet me at the wedding.  Yeah.  And someone in that group really smelled.  Like what, B.O.?  So I couldn't get past the smell to, you know, check her out until later on.  Upper body smell or lower body smell?  It definitely smelled like underarms.  Upper body.  Upper body.  So we got instant feedback here from Chris from Jersey. All psychopaths. 
[113:00]
 All psychomarch psychopaths.  Yes.  Attention. Channel 2 and Channel 4 are going to be on campus of Mount Clare State University.  There is a fire in one of the dorms and the students are complaining about unsafe living conditions.  Channel 2 and 4 will be at the campus of Montclair State University, probably starting at 5.  Yeah.  You know what to do. You know what to do.  Rock.  The psychopaths were out in force last night at Raw's War at the Garden. I want to thank all you guys for helping our cause, okay? 
[113:30]
 Sure thing.  Yeah, we need our first live wow on TV. We got to bring this to the next level.  Females.  I want some females to do some wowing when you see the live shots going on. Live wow.  Yes.  All right?  I got to go back to Karen. No takers yet.  Oh.  Karen, it's not looking good.  Oh, no.  Maybe I made you sound too like... 
[114:00]
 Too sweet or something?  Not too sweet. No, I think the whole body odor thing might be turning off some ladies. But I can't say for sure it was you.  Okay.  So I'm going to go with that then.  Have you ever kissed a girl?  Oh, absolutely.  You have?  Actually, my first experience, I was 16 and I was actually dating, quote unquote, whatever you can call it in high school. This is a 19-year-old.  And she, you know, it was the whole like she taught me everything I know, showed me the ropes kind of thing. And then when she was bored with me, she just, you know, didn't call or nothing. 
[114:30]
 Oh, really?  Yeah. So I was kind of scorned. So I didn't go that route for a while. But it's definitely been a while.  Would you get real wild today?  Yeah, sure. Why not?  All right. Bring in the lesbian couch, boys. Well, Karen, get your ass over here. We'll try to figure something out.  All right.  All right.  All right. No problem.  Hold on. Rick's going to talk to you.  Okay.  We're going to do something. 
[115:00]
 Sounds like she's willing to have some fun, Anthony.  Yes.  Can't we?  Yes, we can.  Relax, Psycho Mark, you ass.  It's all wound up.  All right. We got to take a quick break. We'll be back. Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail? I disqualified myself because I got them both.  I'm the best, Mero.  1027-WNEW. 
[115:30]
 Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. I'm percolating a little bit, Anthony.  We have Karen coming down. She wants to be lesbian for a day.  And she has no sense of smell. We want to test out her smelling abilities, Anthony.  A lot of guys donating their services.  One guy on the instant feedback. Where is it?  Dan from Staten Island. Hey, guys, I've been wearing sweatpants all day and my... 
[116:00]
 Has a strong vinegar odor.  Aw, man.  Ask Karen if she thinks the stench would re-ignite her sense of smell.  That's friggin' disgusting.  But very, very funny.  She could date Ziggy.  I'm Ziggy.  That's what we should get. That's perfect.  Get Ziggy down here.  If we could get Ziggy down. When is she coming? By 6 o'clock, let's say?  She's going to be here in a half hour.  Where's the Zigster?  Rick, go out on the streets of New York and find a smelly bum. I'm serious. 
[116:30]
 Yes, find the smelliest one you can.  Is the upper man out there today?  No, he left already.  He left today?  Smellier than him.  We need someone that's really, really smelly.  Ziggy.  I know. Ziggy would be perfect, but I don't know if we could get him in time.  I'll call.  Call up Keith the Cop.  Put the bat signal out for Ziggy. It's a big light, like trash can.  I think.  That's an amazing thing, being born without the ability to smell. 
[117:00]
 That sense of smell is kind of important.  I would have had a lot more fun in college if I had that ability, not the smell.  With that one girl where you had to drive with your hand out the window the whole way home.  All right, let's say.  That's a horrific story.  You'd miss a lot, though. The smell is kind of important.  I don't know. Think about it.  What?  That could be a cool thing.  No, sometimes the sense of smell gives you a memory of something. 
[117:30]
 Sure.  It smells like a school cafeteria, lunch box, and it brings you right back, you know?  Stuff like that. Grandma's cooking sauce in the kitchen.  I like walking around the streets of Manhattan and you pass by a girl that's wearing a perfume that some old broad used to go out with.  Used to wear?  Yeah.  That used to give you like...  The best sex of your life.  Yeah, and all of a sudden you're like...  You're just brought right back to that time. You're like, oh.  Yeah, it smells a weird thing because it could... 
[118:00]
 I think that's the only thing that can be exactly the same as it was in the past.  Like sight isn't because time has passed by and touch, I don't know.  It's kind of different because time has passed.  Well, we have no takers for carrot.  Lisa!  Yes?  You want to be a lesbian?  You wouldn't know if you had dog crap on your shoe.  Just keep walking around.  Hold on, Lisa. Your phone blows.  Put up, let's try this again.  Oh. 
[118:30]
 Lisa!  Yes?  All right, you want to be lesbian for a day?  Why not?  Today?  I can't get there today. I'm on Long Island.  I tried to get there today.  I need the guy that answered the phone.  We need to make it happen today.  Can't we make it happen tomorrow?  No, because I think we've got enough ladies that are listening to the show that want to be little radio stars.  We've got the lesbian couch.  I'm not going to be a radio star. I'm looking at Karen.  Well, what we'll have to do is hook you up with someone else in the future.  Okay, dude.  All right, because Karen is definitely cute. 
[119:00]
 She's coming down and we're going to find a lady to be a lesbian for a day with her today.  All right?  What number?  10.  Oh my God.  Oh my God, what is with her?  Is that a payphone?  I want to be a lesbian for a day.  I want to pay for one.  Let me put another in.  Jesus.  Hey, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  You're on the air.  Yeah, it's Bobby from Sign Out.  How are you guys?  Hey, thanks, Bobby.  I had a little solution, but you guys are going on it. 
[119:30]
 Maybe for a lesbian for a day, you can find a girl that's good looking but doesn't have, let's say, better roses down there and see if she would be able to smell that because that's sometimes pretty nasty.  Well, that's kind of what we were thinking a little earlier, you know.  Well, we'll have to see what she's all about when she gets down here.  I appreciate it.  You guys will.  Thank you.  Well, we definitely need to get a lady down here to the studio immediately to hook up with Karen. 
[120:00]
 I saw her at the wedding this past Friday.  She's not bad.  What's with that on my side?  She's all right.  Oh, I thought maybe she was coming down.  Debbie?  Yeah?  Do you have no sense of smell either?  No, I never had one.  I couldn't tell you what anything smelled like.  So you have no clue what smell is then?  Nope.  I couldn't tell you what perfume, flowers, food, anything.  And you never had it, so you're not missing anything?  Nope.  Not that I, well, I can drive through parts of Staten Island without being sick, but other than that. 
[120:30]
 What do you think smell is?  What do I think it is?  Yeah, if you've never had it before.  I don't know.  I always wonder because people smell, like they say, oh, I smell bacon, I smell this.  I can't smell anything.  And my sense of taste is off, too.  Really?  You must be a cheap date because if you can't smell, you really can't taste, so we could just put any type of food in front of you.  Have the chunk of soy on the steak.  Well, I'm not blind.  No, but it's the most unusual thing, but I'm not really missing out on too much that I'm aware of.  You can't smell cologne. 
[121:00]
 Huh?  You could be blind, Jesus.  Well.  Having a sense of smell is a pretty cool thing.  Well, I wouldn't have anything to compare it to.  Makes changing my son's diaper all that much easier, though.  I can imagine.  No, you couldn't.  And you were born without what?  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  How are you born without this?  It's neurological.  Actually, my dentist was amazed by it, and he said, you can't even get it checked out because it's neurological.  It's not like you have deviated septum or anything.  It's in your brain. 
[121:30]
 Is it your brain, your olfactory?  I believe so.  I guess mine are not functioning.  Someone got a clocker in the head.  Oh, it's been done.  You know, that brings back amnesia or something.  Are you volunteering?  Yeah, we'll crack it with a 2x4.  We'll see if you get your smell back.  Iron Mike will be cracking me?  Yeah.  Whoa, that's something, though.  Hey, do you ever take like a big nasty dump in the bathroom and then somebody passes by and goes, whoo, not me?  I'll take the fifth on that.  Then you wouldn't have a clue. 
[122:00]
 No, I wouldn't, but I'll take the fifth.  How do you know if you stink?  I don't.  That's why I don't wear perfume.  How do you know?  How do you know if your most intimate of area smells?  I get feedback.  You get feedback, huh?  Uh-huh.  And what do they say?  Haven't had any complaints so far.  You know, cleanliness being next to godliness and all.  Yeah, you better keep scrubbed up.  All right, hold on.  I certainly do.  Hold on, Karen's calling back here.  Stop.  Karen.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys I was listening to the show and I was getting ready to come over. 
[122:30]
 Yeah.  There's no way I'm telling you I'm dating Ziggy.  What, are you crazy?  Well, you can't smell him.  You're not going to date him.  We just want you to smell him.  Oh, okay.  Because let me tell you something.  When we had Ziggy come in for the homeless shopping spree, it was the worst smell Aunt  and I have ever smelled in our lives.  It was beyond belief.  Like, we couldn't even be in the same room with him.  No way.  So we're trying to get him down here to test out your lack of smelling.  But even without a sense of smell, you can still taste if something smells bad. 
[123:00]
 Oh, is this my perspective?  Say what?  Is this my perspective, girl?  Oh, no.  I'm on the Nile one.  Sorry.  It's another girl that can't smell.  She sounds cute.  Too bad.  Well, Karen, when are you going to get down here?  I'm getting on the NR as we speak.  Okay.  So I'll be down in like 15 minutes, 20 minutes.  All right, cool.  We've got a bunch of girls starting to check in now.  Oh, yeah.  We're hoping a few show up so you can have your choice, okay?  All right, cool. 
[123:30]
 All right, Karen, we'll see you in a little bit.  Debbie, we've got to let you go too, all right?  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, there you go.  Bye, see you guys later.  Karen, who's cute, coming down to be lesbian for a day and another girl that can't smell.  Let's go to Irene.  Irene, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  All right, I'm going to actually blow off my class at Montclair State.  I was going to go there and flash the cameras, but I'll come down and be lesbian for the day.  All right, hold on.  We need all our soldiers all over the place.  We'll get another lesbian for a day today.  We need you to flash some live TV cameras.  No, I want to come make out with some girls.  Well, if you... 
[124:00]
 I don't want to get arrested, man.  You're allowed to walk around topless in New York State.  Just flash the camera.  Just flash the camera and run.  And then we'll have you on the show and we'll let you have your pick of lesbians.  All right.  Because someone's going to beat you to it, because we need a lady to come down here within the next half hour.  Okay, it'll take me about an hour.  All right.  Can we count on you as far as trying to get on TV today?  I'll try.  Camera's going live at Montclair State in a little while.  That's me.  I'm like a minute away, so I'll be there.  All right. 
[124:30]
 Be incognito.  Five o'clock news coming up.  Don't forget to subscribe to our channel.  Five o'clock news coming up.  Don't be obvious, because they're looking for all you psychopaths at this time.  Yeah, I know.  No, I'll be casual.  Wear something convenient.  And I was walking through Times Square last night on the way to Raw.  And there was a couple news crews, and I noticed a lot of the news crews now have like armed guards around them.  Armed guards.  I swear to you.  I don't want to be taken out by some armed guards.  So just be incognito.  Yeah, I can play off.  All right, you guys.  All right, we'll be watching the TV to see if you pull it off today. 
[125:00]
 All right, have fun with lesbians.  Thank you, Irene.  Bye.  Bye.  Huh?  What's that?  What?  I don't know.  You girls come down here.  Eve, what's up?  Hi there.  Hi.  So yeah, I saw you at the corner because I had no sense of taste or smell.  No, huh?  And I lost in a car accident, so I had it.  In a car accident?  Yeah.  Wow.  What, did you bang your head and that was it, huh?  Well, my head hit a stop sign.  How'd your head hit a stop sign? 
[125:30]
 I mean, I don't mean to laugh, but...  No, believe me, they called the big one in my family.  I got thrown out of a car.  No seatbelt?  No, it was in 89.  Really?  So they had seatbelts in 89?  It wasn't the law.  Oh, seatbelt.  You know, I am the biggest seatbelt advocate.  Let me give you the other side of that, Anne.  I went to college with two girls.  They would be dead if they were wearing their seatbelts.  They would love those stories.  They would have been, though.  Great.  They were thrown from the vehicle. 
[126:00]
 They were thrown from the vehicle.  Their car was completely destroyed.  The cops even said if you had your seatbelts on,  you girls would be dead.  I'm sure the odds are in your favor if you're wearing a seatbelt.  Of course, but...  I mean, I'd rather...  Take the chance with the seatbelt.  Yes, with the seatbelt, because most people just fly  through the windshield out of the car and they're dead.  And hit stop signs.  What part of the body hit the stop sign?  My head.  Your head?  The back of my head.  Flat?  That's what I call it today, because it's worse when you  smell and then you lose it. 
[126:30]
 Yeah.  Because there's so many things that you miss.  You don't smell anything?  No.  Nothing?  And I can't taste anything.  Oh, wow.  What do you miss the most?  What smell do you miss the most?  Oh, the ocean.  The smell of the ocean.  Low tide?  Huh.  Something we all take for granted, I guess, when we smell the ocean.  There's a lot of things that you think about that you just never would even think about.  You know, fresh-cut grass in the spring.  You know, fire when it's in a fireplace and stuff.  All those kind of things you don't even think about. 
[127:00]
 Can't you kind of imagine it, though?  Like, I'm not smelling like fresh-cut...  You know what it is?  It's been like 10 years.  Like, I can imagine what fresh-cut grass smells like right now.  Yeah, but you smelled it, what, like a year ago?  Or whatever.  10 years, 12 years, it's going on, you know?  It's just, you lose it.  Wow.  That's it.  That blows.  No, don't you feel so sorry for me?  No, I mean, you're alive, you know?  No, I mean, it's not like Christopher Reeve is crying for you, you know what I mean? 
[127:30]
 No, I'm...  If you've got to lose something in an accident, the sense of smell is like, ah, okay, I have to deal with it.  No, but there's a bad side, too.  I moved into an apartment a month ago and had a gas leak and I didn't know.  Wow!  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's pretty wild.  Yeah, you know, it took a friend of mine coming over and being like, oh my God, get out of here.  Really?  You know, I'm gonna let it match.  All right, Eve.  Well, thanks for sharing your little story today.  Yeah, I just want you to hear it.  Yeah.  Did anything else happen to you in the accident?  That was it, huh?  Uh, yeah.  What did you hit?  A stop sign.  No, I mean, what, did you fly through the... hit another car? 
[128:00]
 He hit me and the car spun around.  Oh, you weren't... wait a minute.  You weren't in the car?  I was in the car.  That's what... they thought I was a pedestrian, but my car... I was driving the car and the guy hit my car.  Car spun around and when it spun around, I flew out.  Out the window?  Out the open door.  The door opened up.  The door opened and you flew out the door and hit the stop sign.  Oh, man.  Wow.  So everybody wear their seatbelts.  Okay.  That's our lesson today.  Thank you, Eve. 
[128:30]
 Bye.  Bye.  Wear your seatbelt.  You don't know what smells you'll be missing.  Sue, what's going on?  You're next on WNEW.  Hi, Opie.  How are you?  Good.  What is it?  Antchop liver?  Yeah, thanks, Sue.  Hi, Ann.  I'm sorry.  I just want to tell you guys, first of all, I think you're great.  And if you can't get somebody in today to actually do a live performance, I have a story that maybe you'd be interested in.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[129:00]
 Let me just change my template and go ahead.  This is a little different than the fresh cut grass.  Loose lesbo?  I was away recently and I had my first experience with a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And?  You can continue, Sue.  Yeah.  Continue.  Well, I was away with my husband.  We went away.  And we were laying by the pool and he was reading some magazine, some local magazine that was advertising for some sort of club they had, scrub club or something. 
[129:30]
 Oh, my God.  Listen to how this is.  And he was telling me that, you know, it had always been his fantasy to see me with another girl.  Okay.  Well, he's an original thinker.  So, in case you think you're all the same.  Go ahead.  So, anyway, we went to this club and I really was very nervous about this and I don't know, the whole scene was sort of...  I've got to help you along because it sounds like there might be a payoff here. 
[130:00]
 You're on vacation.  Your husband always wanted to see you with another girl.  You're away from home.  No one's going to know who you are.  You're now in a club.  What happens?  Well, we left.  We went back to the hotel and he was so disappointed.  So, he called.  He called this place and asked them if they'd send a girl over.  What place did he call?  This club.  Lesbians Are Us?  This club.  It was this club.  Was it a strip club?  No.  What kind of club?  It was like a massage club or something.  This is what they sort of called themselves as. 
[130:30]
 And they said you could call up and we'll send chicks over?  Well, they didn't say that, but he called and determined as he was and they agreed to do it.  So, I had agreed...  How much?  How much was it?  Yeah.  200 and then you had a tip.  All right.  So, they sent over a girl.  So, he said, I agreed that the only thing that I'd be willing to do, they advertise the sort of like hot lotion massage with light touching.  Light touch. 
[131:00]
 Yeah.  I said, okay.  That's about as far as I'm willing to go.  Anyway, he called.  He said, don't send anybody over here who isn't pretty because we'll send her home.  And anyway, she came and she was very pretty.  All right.  She came to your hotel.  Yeah.  Right.  And well, it went further than the hot lotion massage.  And further than light touching?  Yes.  Did your husband bang her?  No.  No?  No. 
[131:30]
 He just watched?  Well, first he watched.  First he watched.  Were you both on the bed?  Yes.  She started massaging you with the hot oil and the light touching.  Yes.  And then what?  She carefully touched your balloon knot or what?  No.  Your rail's eye?  Were you on your back?  Were you on your belly?  I was on my...  First she told me to...  Ass up in the air?  What?  Just to make sure that we weren't cops that I had to undress.  Okay.  Yeah.  So I took off my dress and I left on just my panties and my underwear. 
[132:00]
 And then I got on the bed.  I was on my back and I sort of bent over and put my dress on the floor.  And as I was doing that she unhooked my bra.  Big boobs?  Me, I'm 34C.  Okay.  All righty.  Nice little size there.  Sure.  And so then she was just kind of rubbing my back and she was saying how pretty I was and  she was really happy to come because she was...  I guess they don't always get people that they're into.  Right. 
[132:30]
 And while your husband's tugging the taffy in the corner.  No.  He was still dressed.  And you were pretty much naked at this point?  I had just panties on.  Okay.  Was she hot?  With the girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She actually really was.  Big boobs?  Yeah.  I'd say she was about the same size as I was.  Mohawk, triangle?  Triangle.  Triangle.  Nice.  Nice.  Okay.  And you?  Mohawk, triangle?  Triangle.  Triangle.  Okay. 
[133:00]
 Good.  Yeah.  But very groomed.  And then she said to my husband, you know, you look pretty warm over there.  So it took him all of five seconds to get his clothes off.  And the two of us were on the bed and I was very, very nervous.  And then...  Oh, she's got to move along.  Yeah, you got to move along.  You had her moving.  We're trying to hang with you, man.  Okay. 
[133:30]
 That train is coming.  I'm going to leave in that station.  The 506 is coming, babe.  Okay.  Let's go.  Well, she went south and I have to say, I really didn't think I would ever like that.  Right.  Well, doesn't your man go south?  Yeah.  Okay.  But this is, you know, not a man.  Yeah, but the girl, I'm assuming, knows, you know, exactly what to do.  I'll have to agree with you on that one.  Okay.  I never kind of believed that.  All right.  Yeah.  She was probably a little softer, a little lighter, right?  Yes, very much so.  She wasn't like painting a fence, right? 
[134:00]
 No.  Is she okay?  No.  So she was doing that.  Thank you, Sam Kinison.  I was giving my husband a hummer.  You've got to write the alphabet.  Thank you, Sam Kinison.  All right, go ahead.  So she was doing her thing.  I was giving my husband a hummer.  Yeah.  And then we sort of just slipped over and I was, you know, doggie style.  She was underneath.  He was from behind.  Wow.  It was pretty wild.  You didn't slip one to her by accident?  Who am I?  Sorry.  Look.  Look where I ended up. 
[134:30]
 No.  Maybe next time.  Yeah, a lot of the listeners are complaining.  This is the first lesbian story that the listeners actually are complaining about.  Yeah.  Why?  Because you took a little too long, I think.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And then she took off for a glow.  Is that a typical male you're painting too long?  Well, Joe says Sue is boring.  Another Joe.  Sue was too slow.  Oh.  Scott, get Sue off the air.  Were you bumping donuts with this girl?  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[135:00]
 How did that feel?  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  All right, so.  Well, thank you for sharing.  I enjoyed the story.  All right.  Take care, guys.  There she goes.  Sue is gone.  And there she goes.  She saved her.  Anthony Cowbell Bill checking in from Daytona.  Jabil.  Hey, what do you say, boys?  We're slapping him.  We're shaking.  Are you hammered down there in Florida?

[137:30]
 very lovely.  We met her at a wedding this Friday.  We're bringing the lesbian couch into the studio.  If you're in the area, we need you to show up immediately.  We need a girl.  All right, let's take a quick break and we'll be back.  Stay there.  We're going to pull the soul up.  We treat them like good people.  You don't talk to Amsterdam.  Hey, f*** you.  Jesus Christ.  Shut up.  You idiot.  You're a s***.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, f*** you.  What a w***.  Are you high? 
[138:00]
 Are you stupid?  Hey, f*** you.  The OP and Ansity Show.  1027 WNEW.  OP and Ansity.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualified myself because I got them both.  Look at that weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  All right, Anthony, what else is going on in the world around us today?  We discussed the downsides of the world around us.  We discussed the Donald Strawberry thing.  Yeah, boss praised for straw.  Did Steinbrenner find Jesus or something? 
[138:30]
 Is that what it was?  Now that he's older, he's an emotional guy, Anthony.  I mean, did he really get into it or something?  You know?  Because that's not the George of old.  He's got a lot of World Series ranks now.  You've got to pray for straw.  Man.  Hey.  Poor guy.  We'll give him another chance.  I'm always into giving people more chances. 
[139:00]
 In the old days.  So we discussed that.  Yeah.  We discussed Kathy Lay quitting Regis and Kathy Lay, plainly.  A lot of rumors that the Brian incident from Letterman had something to do with her quitting  the show, Anthony.  Put her over the top.  So we've got to thank the Radio Chicken Butchy for pulling that off last week.  Eventually everyone will know it was the Radio Chicken Butchy that threw that bra on the  Letterman stage.  Yeah. 
[139:30]
 A lot of people talking about it, but no one knows the details.  I think the newspapers were talking to the Radio Chicken Butchy today, so maybe they'll  finally get some ink on that.  We discussed Anna Kornikova marrying.  That kills us all today.  And we discussed all the...  She's a little bitch rag.  Anna Kornikova?  Yeah.  She knows she's hot.  Yeah.  You ladies that are hot, that's the biggest drag, knowing you're hot. 
[140:00]
 I think she did...  I don't know, though.  And that whole... where is she from?  Russia?  Yeah.  The Russian thing.  Yeah.  You know, good-looking Russian.  I don't know.  She seems like she'd be a real... a real handful.  On a godspeed.  Have fun.  Have fun, Pavel.  Have fun deflowering our princess.  Shot scored!  We can put a light up on her belly.  Eeeeee!  And he nails it. 
[140:30]
 Unassisted goal.  Let's go back to the phones, Anthony.  Joe, you're next on WNEW.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, what's up?  What's up, Dreamweaver?  Yo, listen.  Man, you better not be going to mornings.  I look like a big dick telling everybody that you guys are going to mornings.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  You're one of them guys that can't talk without cursing.  It looks like you have ten effing heads.  Okay, yeah. 
[141:00]
 And you know, we're not going to mornings.  No, we're not going to mornings.  We just felt like messing with the stupid press that think they know everything.  It's not even a consideration.  I was ready to come in.  No, we got a bunch of new radio shows starting, and we hope you guys give the new shows a  chance to develop here at WNEW.  I want to stop listening to Howard all together, listening to you guys.  No, we love Howard.  Oh yeah.  We absolutely love Howard.  A little bit unfunny.  Tune in in the mornings to Howard on K-Rock TV. 
[141:30]
 We love Howard.  Yo, I'm telling you, we were off last night.  We wanted to see what his new TV show is all about.  We're very curious to see if that's going to be a good show.  It doesn't matter if we don't get that sex on here.  Yo, Raw last night?  I told your cable company.  Who watched some Raw last night?  Everyone should watch Son of a Beach.  Son of a Beach?  Son of a Beach, right?  Son of a Beach?  Oh, this guy doesn't shut up.  I'm sorry, my bad.  So you were at Raw last night? 
[142:00]

That's totally not true. It's it's the listeners that are making up all that crap  Oh, it is it we don't like no one anything  Do you know brand new for me? We we we support the stern and his endeavors. We're trying to support it

I have a big dilemma  I don't know whether or not I give my boyfriend a hummer the right way  The right way I mean I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything right and when I ask him he says I'm doing everything right, but  How do you spell X? 
[191:00]
 No no no when you when you question somebody  Yes  Oh  So now you don't know if you're giving hummers properly  I mean, I know I'm doing it right okay, and I very  Doing it and doing it and doing it well doing it and doing it  And but the thing is I don't get like a big reaction out of him only once have I gotten this oh 
[191:30]
 Kind of reaction from him. I gotta play porn star  Yeah, you gotta give the look up. What are you doing? Just kind of I I plus the hair you do  I look up. I make sure he's seeing me doing it. Yeah, you got yeah, that's that's very key  You got it. You got to get that eye contact  Oh, I do and then you know if I'm doing it from the side and he's looking down  I'm making I make sure I put my hair the other way so you can see the 
[192:00]
 You're not using teeth are you no no way in the Charles Bronson face, right?  No  The older audience are you doing wait wait wait why aren't you making the Charles Bronson face?  What's the Charles Bronson face where you put your lips and over your cheek? Oh?  Okay, so I'm so like Charles Bronson. I must dig dig a tunnel  Well, I make sure I I use all motion lotion 
[192:30]
 Everything yeah, and only once have I gotten this all kind of reaction from him. Do you do you complete?  Hold on she completes talking about anything yeah, well her lunch  Do you do you know okay? She completes everything everything and that?  Wow, and and there's no huge reaction, huh?  No, and it's very disappointing to me because he said he enjoys it a lot. He always loves to get one  Are you working it all over the whole thing everything? You know yeah, yeah top the bottom 
[193:00]
 Everything everything varying speeds  Licking everything so I even had a twig and pierce twig and berries  Everything and you have a and you have a tongue piercing yeah, and he's not into this  Yeah, that might be he said he loves it and he every time we see each other  He's like oh, you know whatever you know to do it, and I do it  And I was there any guy reaction from him is there any guy that like is into the tongue piercing for oral? 
[193:30]
 You want a metal thing slapping around on it? No, could you or all tongue underneath?  It's very useful when you use it underneath. I take it out sometimes, but what's good with the metal ball or something the way?  It's like you know under the  Okay, we can figure it out  Now they're just be all beef well tongue  Maybe he's just not into the hummers, but he acts for it every single time 
[194:00]
 Hmm I just want to know I don't know it sounds like you're you're giving him a perfect Hummer  Maybe he's just enjoying himself. He's laying back  Maybe he's too shy to express himself  Maybe he's gay  Maybe he's doing your sister. No. He's not okay. How long you have you been with him?
