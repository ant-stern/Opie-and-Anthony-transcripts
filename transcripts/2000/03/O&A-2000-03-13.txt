 Both Anthony and Rick Staggs.  The Four Morons of the Apocalypse.  107 WNEW.  Ah, yes! The weekend is over!  Hey!  Monday, March 13th, 2000.  The O&A show.  What's up, man? Think I'm still drunk.  Phone line 212-757-1027, with the intermittent arrow. 
[00:30]
 Our fax line 212-957-9639.  Trade, trade, trade.  Gotta get this order in on.  Trade, trade, trade.  Mark has taken a beating today. I didn't even want to look at him, man.  Who? Who what? What?  Today is the day to rejoice, Alfie.  I know you...  If you're a player.  I know you figured out how to make money on today's march.  You long-termers might have been a little hurt today, looking at your...  Looking at your nice blue chips taking a crap. 
[01:00]
 And looking at your tech stocks taking a dump this morning.  You know what I saw when I booted up the computer  and saw that the Nasdaq, within the first, like, hour of trading, was down 200 points?  Oh my God, I went into a buying frenzy.  Buying frenzy.  One stock was down... You know one stock was down 12 points, and it was doing great last week?  I mean, it was down big. Really big.  That's what I call a buying opportunity. 
[01:30]
 And you know, where's it going?  Where the hell's it going? It's the same company it was Friday.  Everyone freaked out, sold like maniacs.  Thank you. I'll buy your shares here. Thank you.  Thank you.  The thing kicked up plus five.  Up five points on the day after being down 12.  Look at you bragging.  You know what you call that?  Look at you bragging.  Not bragging, I'm just saying.  It's not always a bad thing when the Dow and the Nasdaq take a crap. 
[02:00]
 You're a braggart.  I am not.  You're bragging.  I'm telling you how it's done.  Let me just...  I'm giving you some advice.  Let me just ask you one thing, Anthony.  Okay.  That day when you take a dump...  Yeah?  In the market...  Okay.  Are you going to be as open and honest on the air?  Are you going to share that bad news with everybody?  You want me to explain what happens when I did take a dump?  And I do take a dump?  Yeah.  I'll tell you because it happened.  Okay.  It happened.  I had bought something called option contracts open which cost a lot of money. 
[02:30]
 Cost a lot of money.  This is the guy when I first met him.  He had no clue what a dollar was, man.  A lot of money, right?  You had no idea.  Go ahead.  The stock went down.  My options, they expire in time.  Yeah.  And they're ready to expire.  So you know what you do?  You sell it at the loss, okay?  But then you take the money that's left over because you don't wait until you lose it all. 
[03:00]
 Mm-hmm.  And you buy more options for the next month.  And it went back up.  And I did fine.  After I take a dump, I hit the bottle.  That's the truth of the matter.  No.  I'm just saying that it's...  And I don't know you anymore.  It's not always a bad thing when the market takes a crap.  This isn't the same guy that I met like six years ago.  I have no idea who you are anymore.  You've got to be quick on the draw in the morning. 
[03:30]
 I was there hitting that goddamn enter button at 9.32 this morning.  Bye!  Bye Mortimer, bye!  We finally found something to make Anthony wake up before noon.  Oh, I am up.  I am up every day.  When I saw that the futures were down 30 points before the market opened,  I'm dancing around the house.  Dancing!  Come on, open up, market!  This guy, I used to call him on like a Wednesday morning at like 11.30,  and he was still sleeping.  Not anymore.  Not the new Anthony. 
[04:00]
 Oh, no.  If the company wants us to do mornings for them,  what they have to do is get in bed with the Dow Jones  and get them to open up the stock market at 5.30,  and we'll be able to get Anthony in here for a morning show.  That's the only way.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  All right.  It was never able to get up like 8.30 to maybe, you know,  work on the radio show, but 8.30 to make money in the stock market?  No problem.  Let me tell you, you got to be up early. 
[04:30]
 You need, you need Squawk Box on your TV.  You need the computer booted up to E-Trade.  Let me tell you.  And you got to be quick on the drawing.  You got to have balls of steel.  Mark obviously doesn't have any money in the market.  Squawk Box rocks.  Squawk Box, that is better than the Playboy channel  if you're into the market.  It sounds like the Playboy.  No.  Squawk Box.  Yeah, I had this chick, she had a bag of Squawk Box.  Squawk Box rocks in the morning. 
[05:00]
 Oh, Squawk Box.  The only thing they're missing is like a girl and like a thong.  Maria Bartiromo there on the floor of the market.  Oh, she's talking.  She's all sexy and stuff talking about how you're going to lose all your money.  Squawk Box is really good.  Come on.  They just need bikini clad babes and you'd be all set in the morning.  I'm serious.  They joke around.  It's fun.  It's a fun little show.  Yeah.  And then you find out that, you know, they actually just wanting to know.  We're canceling an interview with the CEO of some company 
[05:30]
 because we're expecting a very rocky open to the market today.  The thing dumped.  And you know what?  When you got companies that have been doing very good for a while,  and Friday they were up also.  And for the last two weeks, they've been doing very well.  What has changed over the weekend?  Except the Japs economy took a dump and everybody did a knee-jerk reaction to it.  When you see a stock like that down 12 points, what do you think? 
[06:00]
 It ain't coming back.  What are you silly?  Buy.  Buy, Opie, buy.  So for a Monday Anthony in a very good mood.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm drinking coffee.  You guys when you tune in around, you know, quarter to three and Anthony's not saying much and yeah,  and he sounds a little depressed.  That's because he took a dump in the market and he's not going to tell you about it.  That's all right.  Look, I'm in.  Okay.  I'm not saying what but I'm back in. 
[06:30]
 Got to say it again.  You and I are hilarious because you're short term.  I'm long term.  Yeah, I'm slow and steady.  You are slow and steady.  I'm building slow and steady.  And let me tell you something.  I'm the tortoise.  Let me tell you.  Yeah, Opie is definitely the tortoise.  Let me tell you something.  Opie is doing very well with his stock.  Slow and steady.  I knew all my stocks were going to take a dump today, but I just couldn't sell.  I got to tell you, they're going to go right back up tomorrow Wednesday.  Can I ask you something?  You've been in the market as long as I have.  Yes.  How many stocks have you sold? 
[07:00]
 None.  None.  Opie has never ever sold a stock.  I officially have not sold a stock.  No, no.  And I am way up.  I know you're doing very well.  I need a profit take very soon.  I'm getting a little nervous.  A little nervous, Antoine.  Well, not today.  Like biotech.  You know, I'm a little nervous here.  Yeah, yeah.  Opie owns some stuff in the biotech industries, which is pretty funny.  Opie's funding cures for diseases.  That's right.  Meanwhile, I'm buying into companies. 
[07:30]
 I don't even know what they do.  Oh, trust me.  There's a couple I'm in.  I have no clue what they do.  No clue.  No idea.  I'm just praying it goes up.  Got a couple hunches in there, you know?  Very funny.  I never thought I'd see the day that I jump on the Long Island Railroad with a Wall Street  Journal in my hand.  Yeah?  Well, you got to keep tabs on what's going on.  What the hell happened to us?  I don't know.  You're right.  What the hell did happen to us?  When I met Antoine, I was on smack.  He was a drug. 
[08:00]
 I was always in the crack pipe.  We still don't have money, but we're learning how to invest.  So after we get fired again, we'll have some money.  I like the idea of having a little bit of money and the risk that it might all be gone  tomorrow.  That gets my adrenaline pumping.  That's fun too, right?  Man.  Yeah, you got to love the market.  It's the funniest damn thing out there.  And it's just within the past few years that it's been open to the regular guy.  Because for years, it was like in trading places. 
[08:30]
 Mortimer.  Mortimer.  Sell Mortimer, sell.  You know, that's what it was like.  You know, now that I'm in the market, that movie is so much funnier.  Yeah, I know.  Trading places is so much funnier.  Because I didn't understand any of that crap when I was just a teenager watching the movie  for the first time.  But you get the hang of it.  You see the ups and downs.  You take a few really bad hits when you first start doing it.  And then after a while, you catch on.  You take some hits.  You make some gains.  And you hope the gains outweigh the hits. 
[09:00]
 And that's about it.  It's pretty funny.  So obviously, Anthony made a S-load today.  It was a very good day.  And we still all had to pay for our own coffee today.  You cheap son of a bitch.  Hey, I bought the coffee today, paly.  I put money in for the coffee.  And when does Opie ever put money in for the goddamn coffee, Ben?  Ben, don't you dare.  It is me, Ben, even stinky.  You son of a bitch.  I think even stinky foot the bill once or twice.  I put money in for the coffee Friday.  And I just gave him four bucks today for one cup of coffee. 
[09:30]
 It was the Dukes.  It was the Dukes.  I got to rent that movie.  Hallelujah.  Yeah, I don't think Opie has bought the coffee once.  This medium coffee today cost me four bucks.  So come on, Ben.  Thank you.  Let's deal in reality here.  Anthony did throw in $10, but stinky had already left.  He made, you know how much money he made today?  Do you know how much money he made today?  My life is changing. 
[10:00]
 Come on.  I'm starting to think that I need to do a little short-term trading.  Walking around the halls bragging.  I'm not bragging.  Did he brag at lunch?  Who?  Ant, when we were walking out the door.  No, I think they just heard me yelling from inside the office.  Come on, Tray, go through.  God damn it.  You're a lunatic, an absolute lunatic.  I'm yelling at the computer.  Actually put down the video games today  so I could play the best video game of all, Wall Street. 
[10:30]
 It's a fun game.  I'm impressed.  You only get one try at it.  No, I said we come in three or four hours before the show.  Our priorities are all f-ed up.  When do we start talking about the show, Anthony?  When did we get on?  We have a whole system of things we do,  and none of it involves trying to get ready for a radio show.  No, not at all.  Calling brokers, checking out stock quotes,  playing a little video game. 
[11:00]
 Well, I guess the old boss gave us one thing to do.  That was one good thing.  Yeah, the old boss taught us all about the stock market.  We'd go into meetings.  I guess someday we will thank him.  Meetings that were supposed to be about the show.  We were supposed to talk about the show,  and we'd sit there, and he'd have the stock ticker on, on the TV.  We're like, what's that?  What does that do?  Look at that.  Oh, wow.  I just bought some American Express, and I took it out of it.  Like, what?  What happened? 
[11:30]
 And he kind of explained it, you know?  He explained options.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Oh, no better feeling in your gut than when your options are ready to expire.  And you got any puts?  Huh?  No, you know something?  I don't bet against these stocks.  I wait until the real good ones take a dump, and then I buy calls.  That's it.  They're coming back.  I give them a month.  They come back.  Well, let's take a break.  Like a bad rash. 
[12:00]
 Let's take a break here.  Congratulations on your big win today in the stock market.  Thank you.  Thank you, Opie.  I'm feeling pretty good.  Feeling all good about yourself, right?  I'm feeling pretty good.  Well, I did dump $500 on my brakes for my truck and an oil change.  I don't have a car.  I'm so glad right now.  Say hi to Dean down there at the mobile station.  Dean?  He takes care of me, hooked me up.  I'm looking for a truck.  No one has them in stock, though, what I want.  What do you want?  Isuzu. 
[12:30]
 Thinking Grand Cherokee.  Oh, yeah?  Going for the Jeep.  Um, what about the Jeep?  My Grand Cherokee?  The, uh, the Jeep.  No, the, uh, help me out, Ben.  What are you writing notes up?  I had to drive the purple car.  I had to drive the purple car around yesterday.  Wait a minute, what?  The Cabrio?  Let's take a break.  With all the guys?  Yeah.  Oh, how much of a nagging did you do? 
[13:00]
 All right, let me take a break, and we'll  talk about the guys' weekend.  A couple of the guys came out to the island,  living it up in Huntington with me over the weekend.  We'll talk about that next, and whatever you guys want  to talk about.  212-757-1027.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF,  and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony, on 1027 WNEW.  You guys have deteriorated to the unbelief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[13:30]
 Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, we are here in a good mood.  It's Monday.  What's up?  How much?  Dave from Stanford, Connecticut, on the Instant Feedback.  Call me crazy, but taking market advice from ONA  is like taking child rearing advice from an abortion doctor.  That's right.  So don't listen.  Don't listen to anything Anthony has to say. 
[14:00]
 But I do believe he has figured out the market,  and he's not sharing with us.  Oh, he hints.  He hints and tells us a little bit about what he's doing.  But actually sharing and saying, Opie, give me like 10, 20 grand.  I'm going to make you an S-load.  Oh, no.  No, you know why, Opie?  I am playing the nothing to lose game.  If you know what I mean.  You take the money that you're not going to have anyway in a few months. 
[14:30]
 So you know you're losing this money.  Well, pretty much.  OK.  So worse than capital gains tax.  Worse than capital gains, yeah.  I understand taxes, people.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  But you know, you try to get as much as you can while you can.  And it's, let's just say, a very aggressive strategy.  I wouldn't do this with your retirement funds.  You know what I mean?  But you just go to town.  Go crazy.  So your strategy is knowing you're going to lose, well, it could be a lot of money. 
[15:00]
 Yeah.  OK.  You're going to lose some cash.  Let's put it this way.  You have a sum of money.  Right.  You know you're going to lose a lot of that sum of money.  Yes.  So what the hell?  Might as well gamble a lot of that money.  Take it away.  Yeah.  Let it ride.  Let it ride.  Let it ride.  Dumb legs in the fifth at Belmont.  It's almost as bad as just taking all this money that you know you're going to lose a lot of.  Yeah.  And putting it on black down there in Atlantic City.  If I was closer to AC, I'd do that. 
[15:30]
 But I'll tell you, we should do that.  Come on.  Let's do it.  Take everything just black.  Well, not even everything.  Just a good, nice chunk of money and see what happens.  Just black.  Like a 10, 15 grand.  We'll go down there.  Lop it down.  We'll broadcast live.  Black.  Black.  One bet.  One bet.  What do you think?  Mmm.  I like it.  You do?  Hell yeah.  I think we should.  Black.  We should. 
[16:00]
 One bet.  Why not?  Oh, that would rock.  Oh, that would be horrible.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Oh, I am looking for a Dodge Durango.  Jim, yes I am.  Oh, look at that.  Well, I can't drive this Cabrio anymore.  Yeah, now, you know, I have this great strategy.  You know, I'm like, ah, it's winter time.  You know, I'm commuting on the Long Island Railroad.  I'll buy the, I'll drive the car that I bought Sandy.  The Cabrio.  The Cabrio.  The chick car.  That's a Cabriga.  That's supposed to just go to the, you know, the beaches in my area. 
[16:30]
 Right.  And a little like, you know, errands around town.  Little car.  It's made for a chick.  So my lease was up.  So I'm like, ah, screw it.  I don't need the car during the week.  I think I can handle driving it, you know, maybe an hour on the weekend.  Right.  I do what I have to do.  Yeah.  I can't handle it anymore.  Well, you made the mistake because you invited out the guys.  Psycho Mark and Ben came out for the day.  And now you have to cart them around in the Cabrio.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I would have rented a car for the weekend just to keep the abuse factor down. 
[17:00]
 Not only that, our buddy Jay from Boston came down.  Yeah.  He's got the Grand Cherokee, another car I really like.  Our favorite drunk, Jay.  And he refused to drive the Grand Cherokee this weekend.  I'm like, come on, let me drive your car.  We're not going to drive all over creation in this stupid Cabrio.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a nice truck now.  So I had to drive the Cabrio down to Little Italy.  What?  Yeah.  Wait, can I turn my mics off? 
[17:30]
 What were you going to say?  Oh, all right.  I can get that.  I don't have any of my sounds yet.  But yeah, I had to drive the Cabrio to Pizano for a little Italian feast.  Yeah.  Oh, you went to Pizano's too.  I had a great time Saturday at Pizano.  I want to say hi to Pete and the gang.  And then we had to drive the Cabrio all the way down to New Brunswick.  Ha!  Cabrio.  Ha!  For Lewis Black.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you went to see Lewis.  Dude, I was driving all over.  Look at this fun-filled weekend with the guys and the Cabrio. 
[18:00]
 I was driving all over the place with this stupid Cabrio.  Was Fez with you?  Shut up!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Rude and rude.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Ha!  All right.  Is that the horn of the Cabrio?  Hey!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  What kind of host I am, though?  Ben and Psycho Mark, they come out to Huntington.  You know how rocking it is for St. Patty's Day, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Got to thank Pat and the gang at Mears for treating us all very nicely. 
[18:30]
 We're thanking a lot of people this month.  Hell yeah.  We had a lot of fun at Mears and Huntington.  And Ben and Psycho Mark, they take a train out to my town there.  And I refused to pick them up.  I made my brother pick them up first.  Why?  Because of the Cabrio?  Because of the Cabrio?  Ha!  I was too lazy.  I was on the couch watching the real world road rules challenge.  Off of the 18th time. 
[19:00]
 So Mark calls and says, we're at the train station.  I go, Mark, I'll be there in 20 minutes after my show is over.  F!  Really?  You're coming out?  You're a guest of OPI?  What a CSer, yeah.  Did you stay at the palatial OPI manor for any length of time?  Yeah, we got a summer.  Yeah.  The tree house.  The tree house.  And you guys thought we were making money.  See what I learned?  Tom!  This is better than this!  That's, you know something? 
[19:30]
 And it's funny because the first time I met OPI, and I started doing a show at night,  a couple of nights a week at most, there was a turning point.  OPI goes, hey, come over to my house.  You know, we'll talk about the show and some ideas and some options maybe that we can get  a show to maybe go to another city.  You know, just planning out the OPI and Anthony strategy.  So he invites me to the house in Northport.  I'm thinking, oh, Northport.  Right on the water.  I'm finally going to see it.  I bet it's just a view of the harbor and everything. 
[20:00]
 It's going to be beautiful, right?  I drive up to the biggest asshole house I've ever seen and it's OPI's house!  It totally, like, put things in perspective.  And then I thought, well, maybe this is just his summer place.  I swear, I thought it was like his summer house.  I figured everyone on the radio's got to make a lot of money.  It ain't the case.  No, not at all.  Or you wouldn't be playing the stock market like you did.  Tell me about it.  You wouldn't have time for that if you were making the real bucks. 
[20:30]
 Exactly.  But no, we had fun, right?  What did we do?  We drank all day.  Drank?  What, you forget or just pass out?  I don't remember.  Psycho Mark is a sick F. You know how he does that?  You have a 50-cal?  Right.  Throughout the whole bar, horrifying chicks.  That's what I do best.  Did Will make a visit out to Long Island?  Will didn't even come out!  Will wasn't there.  Will played the artist and didn't show up.  Every time Psycho Mark goes to a bar and puts a few on, he goes up to these really hot chicks 
[21:00]
 and goes, hey, I'm Will Pindarvis from K-Rock.  How you doing?  And the girls just look at him horrified.  Hey, give me your number, hot babe.  I'm Will.  It's the funniest thing you'll ever see.  Now, he was doing better stuff.  The place, you couldn't move yesterday.  St. Patrick's Day, Huntington.  It's a big deal.  Psycho Mark is giving the how much sign to chicks across the bar.  Oh my.  And then doing the BJ face.  You know all that.  That was his deal, though. 
[21:30]
 That was his deal yesterday as we're trying to hang out and party.  Wonderful.  How much?  It almost worked.  Let's go to Chris.  What a mess you guys are in.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, I want to talk about the Lewis Black Show Saturday.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  What show were you at?  I was at the 830 show.  Yeah, I went to the 11 o'clock show, man.  You were?  It was awesome.  I had a lot of fun.  I had a lot of fun.  I had a lot of fun.  I had a lot of fun.  You were?  It was awesome.  I had a great time. 
[22:00]
 Lewis was on, man.  It was just so cool.  I got to thank someone else, Vinny and the gang at the Stress Factory.  Definitely.  Vinny was great.  He did really well.  They run a great little establishment down there in New Brunswick.  It was a small place, but it was just awesome.  Small place, but they do it upright and you can tell the guy cares about his club, man.  Yeah, it was very good.  I'd love to see Jay Moore there.  That would be just awesome.  Not a bad idea.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Lewis Rock, definitely.  It was good.  That was the first time I saw him and I, wow, I highly recommend you go see him next time  he's in the area. 
[22:30]
 Definitely.  Syndication now, guys.  All right, Chris, thank you.  All right, see you later.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Another week of syndication now.  All right.  I think we're all getting up on that slowly but surely.  Karen, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Formerly Stinky Karen, what's up?  What's up?  Oh, hey, you even smell better over the phone.  Of course, Karen, the star of the Friday show, had a little bubble bath with two fine dancers 
[23:00]
 from Privilege.  Well, what happened?  What did he say?  You farted?  Yeah.  By that mic.  God damn.  Shirts up.  Dude, I saw what you ate after we drank.  Maybe we're talking to Karen.  We may as well just relive some of the memory.  An Irishman the day after St. Patty's.  I saw what he ate after we drank.  I'm not taking any chances.  I'm not waiting for it to waf over here.  Must have looked like a salad shooter in the bowl.  Dude, corned beef and cabbage.  Oh, no.  With a Greek salad. 
[23:30]
 I think he had baked clams on top of it.  I'm not taking any chances.  The Irish breakfast, the cheese, the bread, the cheese, the cheese.  I'm not taking any chances.  The Irish breakfast, the champions.  I just think the air current is in my favor today.  I don't smell anything coming over here.  I think we're safe.  So what's up, Karen?  I just got a little tidbit for you. 
[24:00]
 When I was going to the Met, to be in my art history class,  I was on time.  Let me explain really fast.  Karen did the bubble bath on Friday  with the dancers from Privilege.  Great footage, by the way, on foundrymusic.com.  They got a lot of clips up there.  A lot of people checked it out live Friday thanks to the Spaz camp.  And you stayed late.  You had to meet your art class at the Met.  That's how we left it.  You finally ran out with smelling like whore, basically, 
[24:30]
 between the bubble bath and the strippers.  Forget about it.  And you left and you met up with your art class.  What happened?  I just made it.  They were walking out and getting ready to go in.  And so I just made it.  And I went through that yada yada yada.  I get home, right?  I have the biggest lipstick stain on my chin.  On your chin? 
[25:00]
 On my chin, dude.  And I totally didn't even know until I got home,  but nobody said anything to me.  Wow.  Thank God you didn't take your clothes off to pose.  You would have saw a lot more.  A lot more lipstick stains all over your cans.  I was so embarrassed.  I was like, oh my God, when I got home, I was like, oh God.  Wow.  Did you shower today?  How are you doing?  Yes, I showered today.  You're using the soap and everything?  Yes.  Very good.  All right, Karen.  All right.  I decided to share that with you guys. 
[25:30]
 But thank you so much for Friday.  That was a lot of fun.  No, we have to thank you.  I still haven't gotten through all the email from Friday's show.  Unbelievable reaction.  You want to be artist formerly known as Stinky Karen.  That's right.  All right.  All right, great.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Karen.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  Bye.  I hope she doesn't give up any lucrative jobs like McDonald's for that art career  because I'll tell you, from that drawing she brought in here,  it looked like, I swear to God, the arm and leg proportions  were out of a thalidomide baby.  It was really bad. 
[26:00]
 I've got to be honest.  She was all proud.  She goes, look what I did in art class.  Like, huh, you find things like that hanging up on a fridge  from a kindergarten kid.  All right, well, we're just getting started here.  I was thinking that there was anything to mention about my weekend,  but it was, you know, I saw a movie.  It was just a good time.  I went to the movies.  Well, which one you say?  Mission to Mars.  Number one at the box office this weekend, Antoine's.  I guess a lot of other people were suckered in. 
[26:30]
 Oh, really?  Movie Blue.  You didn't like it?  No.  It was really bad.  I would do a little review on it if we got to go to a break or something.  I could tell you about that F'ing Ruski behind me with his cell phone.  All right, we could take a quick break and we'll do that.  And then, let's talk about Mission to Mars.  Yeah.  And let's also talk about the raising of the wooly mammoth crap  the Discovery Channel threw at us last night.  Ah.  I thought this thing was going to be something, but...  It was going to be a cool show.  They were going to pull a wooly mammoth out of the ice. 
[27:00]
 Yeah.  But it didn't happen.  I didn't see it.  I had a few problems with the show, Anthony.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  You guys can punch like you pissed me off, okay?  One, oh, two, seven, W-N-E-W.  Anthony!  Yes?  Got to welcome Dr. Philotoff and Diamond Vision back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  This guy is Opie's savior.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, Opie...  Now it's just commonplace. 
[27:30]
 I think about a month or so after you got the laser vision correction, the Diamond Vision procedure done,  you wouldn't shut up every two seconds.  Hey, I could read this.  Hey, my eyes are great.  Hey, I was on the train.  I looked out the window.  Oh, I could read something on the side of the oil tanks.  You know, and we're thinking big whoop.  But then you really think about it.  It's a miracle.  What the Lord did not give Opie, good vision, Dr. Philotoff was able to.  To this day, I leave the house every day looking for my glasses. 
[28:00]
 I'm like, oh, yeah, I don't need them anymore.  And my shoes.  Yeah, it still freaks me out.  You know how bad the rain was on Saturday?  I mean, horrendous downpour.  And we had to drive all the way to New Brunswick for the Lewis Black Show.  I would not...  I wouldn't even do that drive with my glasses.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm doing it without glasses because I got the new 2015 vision thanks to  Dr. Philotoff and Diamond Vision.  Turned you into a madman.  Look at you driving in the rain.  You animal.  You know that he's performed over a thousand procedures, Anthony? 
[28:30]
 Including LT.  Really?  He did Lawrence Taylor's eyes.  Was he missing the pipe with his mouth?  He's done Tiki Barber.  Yeah.  And Sue Wicks.  All right.  Dr. Philotoff is now...  Who did they play for?  Dr. Philotoff is now calling himself the Doctor of the Stars, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It's going to his head a little bit.  But it should go to his head because he's pretty much a god in everyone's eyes that 
[29:00]
 gets this procedure done.  Absolutely.  He's got three convenient offices in Manhattan, Westport and Greenwich.  And here's the big news, gang, all right?  Due to an enormous response for the Valentine's Day promotion that we did a little while ago,  Anthony?  Yes.  Diamond Vision would like to again give the gift of sight to one of our faithful listeners,  Anthony.  What you got to do is contact Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  He's going to put you in the running for a complimentary vision correction and a free  exam.  If you enter the last time we did this, you will automatically be entered in the contest, 
[29:30]
 all right?  Oh, my God.  Not everyone can afford this procedure, so this is the doctor's way of saying thank you  to the O.P. and Anthony fans.  You know who Dr. Philotoff is like?  Jesus Christ.  Remember Jesus would walk around and heal people, randomly heal people like that for  nothing.  Just go by blind person, boom, leper, boom.  Dr. Philotoff is just taking people and for free, if you win, if you win the contest,  yes, he will heal you like Jesus Christ.  For free, he will heal you like Jesus Christ. 
[30:00]
 Yes, Dr. Philotoff of Nazareth.  Dr. Philotoff of Diamond Vision, give them.  Oh, Diamond Vision.  What did you say?  I said of Nazareth.  Oh, my Jesus.  Give Diamond Vision a call.  It's 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  And if you need that number, just give us a call here and we'll give that to you, okay?  Dr. Philotoff and Diamond Vision.  Opie and Anthony.  What other radio show is going to give you like intelligent talk about stocks and girls  playing once in my pants? 
[30:30]
 Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  All right, and so you were saying.  Yes.  You went to see Mission to Mars over the weekend?  Yeah, it blew.  You know, the commercials look pretty cool.  Any kind of space movie, I'm into it.  You know, it looked like they really depicted Mars pretty good.  Nice.  So, I don't know.  I don't know what they did.  The story, it was slow. 
[31:00]
 It was silly.  And it wasn't, didn't hold my attention.  And for a space movie, it's got to be really bad because I just like those things.  Was it a long movie?  It seemed it.  Yeah.  Seemed pretty long.  Maybe the guy behind you was distracting you.  Maybe that was it.  You know something?  I swear they ought to, when they rip your ticket at the front, hand out guns to everybody.  And you're allowed, if you walk in, it means you have given up your right to live if you have a cell phone in there. 
[31:30]
 Or yapping kids.  Because there was a guy behind me, some Russian guy.  And I'm going to make a blanket statement right now.  All you Russians are inconsiderate bastards, okay?  Just because one guy pissed you off.  Blanket statement.  That's all.  And there was a Russian guy behind me with his kid.  Obviously his kid wanted to see the movie.  So we took the kid.  He didn't care about it.  Well, let me stop you there. 
[32:00]
 Is this a kid's movie?  Well, any space movie, you'll get more kids to.  But is it catered to adults?  No, I think what they were trying for was a 2001, a Space Odyssey thing.  And it just wasn't quite there.  So the guy behind me brings his kid, obviously it was just for the kid.  Because he spent the whole time with the...  Brrr, brrr, brrr.  Well, pretty much.  What the bangers were doing.  That's what I wish.  Not even a conversation I could listen to.  Maybe it was in English and it was interesting, more interesting than the movie. 
[32:30]
 I'd listen. What the hell?  That's what I wish.  That's what I wish.  That's what I wish.  I wish.  I wish.  Boris Batonov sitting behind me.  Great.  Talking to Natasha about the moose and squaddle.  I'm trying to watch the movie.  So at first I'm just like...  Brrr, brrr.  Oh, good. Who is it?  You know, I'm kind of being sarcastic and catching the attention of a few people.  How many times did it ring?  Three times during the movie.  So the first time I'm like, whatever, okay, maybe it's an urgent call from the Kremlin. 
[33:00]
 I don't know.  So I'll leave it alone.  The second time I said that whole thing, hello, yes, hello, who is it?  Being all sarcastic.  The third time it rings and he's talking.  I'm like, okay, I'll give him a couple of minutes.  Just because the movie sucked so bad.  If it was a good movie, first ring, goodbye.  But the movie sucked, okay, I can live with it.  This is going on ten minutes. Ten minutes.  He's right behind my head. 
[33:30]
 Because you know what he's doing?  The kid is leaning back in his seat watching the movie.  So as not to disturb the kid, he leans all the way forward to the back of my seat.  Now he's an inch from the back of my head.  He's right in your ear.  He's in my ear so he doesn't think I'm there.  So you had a Russian in your ear.  A Russian was in my ear.  In your ear.  In my rear?  I said in your ear.  In my rear.  No, the Russian was in my ear.  In your ear.  Yes. 
[34:00]
 Yeah.  What?  Yeah, he was right in my ear.  In your ear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was he doing, you know, in your ear?  Talking.  Whispering sweet nothings.  Alright.  Oh, come on.  He didn't touch your ear.  No.  Nope, no touching.  Okay.  Hey!  For some reason he wanted to talk right next to your ear.  Right next to my ear.  Right.  You're an asshole.  Well, it might be my Long Island accent or something. 
[34:30]
 Yeah.  Alright, go ahead.  My ear.  In your ear.  He wouldn't shut up.  Right.  He finally turned around and as he's talking, looked him square in the eyes and just stared  at him like I'm staring right at him a foot away.  Just staring at him.  And he's still, oh, he's staring right back at me.  Not stopping.  He wasn't stopping. 
[35:00]
 So I'm staring.  I go, you've got to, this loud in the movie theater.  You've got to be kidding me.  At which point he came out of his trance.  So wait, wait, wait.  So he was looking you in the eye when he was next to your ear.  Yeah, kind of hard to do, huh?  A little bit.  Alright, so how did that?  That old gag.  I know.  So how did it end?  He got up at that point and walked out of the theater.  Which I think made a few other people happy too. 
[35:30]
 Because you get to hear that little cheer like, hey.  It's like you kicked somebody out that was being a real a-hole.  But my God, the cell phones in the theaters, turn the goddamn thing off.  You went to a movie.  You're not alone in your living room.  Well, there's a lot of places where cell phones should be turned off.  Rude and rude.  The other one is the Long Island Railroad.  Or any railroad for that matter.  The Long Island Railroad, after a long day, this was on Friday, you get in one of those  cars where everyone is snoozing. 
[36:00]
 Everyone.  Right, right.  You don't have the bar car.  I mean, if you want to have fun, you go to the bar car.  You get a few wobbly pops before your wife that you hate picks you up at the train station.  They got strippers in there now too.  They should.  They might as well.  But there are some of those cars where everyone is asleep.  And that's how they're going to deal with their commute home.  They want to catch a couple of Z's, okay?  Yeah.  So I'm out cold.  My face is up against the window.  I'm drooling on myself.  And behind me, obviously this guy just got his cell phone turned off. 
[36:30]
 Ah, the person that has to call everyone for no reason.  Exactly, because he just got his cell phone.  Hey, I'm talking.  Guess where I am?  Right, right.  Guess where I'm calling you from?  No, it gets worse than that.  So I'm sitting there.  I am out cold.  I am snoring.  I'm drooling.  And also behind me, I hear, beep, beep, boop, beep, beep, beep.  He's dialing someone up.  It rings a couple of times.  And this is what all I get to hear is, what's up?  What's up?  As loud as can be.  As everyone in this car is trying to sleep. 
[37:00]
 Great.  He's got to let everybody in the car know that he's got a cell phone.  So I scream.  I don't even give it three times.  I go, you've got to be kidding me.  That seems to be the thing you say.  Right.  To the point where a few people started laughing right away.  So now we all go back to sleep.  Next thing you know, beep, boop, boop, beep, beep, beep.  What's up?  Oh my God.  Dude, it's a stupid commercial.  Okay, we've all done it.  But on a train while we're all trying to sleep?  Oh, public stonings. 
[37:30]
 If you're annoying enough people, stonings.  Bring him back.  Come on.  Was he doing this right in your ear?  That's where the phone's here.  Let's talk to Lou.  Lou, you're next on WNEW.  What's going on today, man?  I lived in Brooklyn my whole life, and we moved out because of the Russians.  And we're not talking Brian Beach.  Wait, wait.  Let me learn a little something here.  My buddy's now living in Brooklyn.  Anthony, there's a lot of Russians in Brooklyn?  Lots of Ruskies right off the boat.  I'm not talking second generation where you learned, you assimilated to society. 
[38:00]
 I'm talking the ones off the boat that have no concept of the American way of life.  They are the rudest bunch of sons of bitches you're ever going to see.  Ever.  I did not know that.  Blanket statement, the whole race yaddle-doodle.  I thought it was just Italians in Brooklyn.  No.  And the darkies.  Brooklyn, Brooklyn, very diverse depending on which section you go.  There's a lot of Italians.  Then there's Asian sections and a lot of Russians.  And Jews, a lot of Jews, acidic Jews. 
[38:30]
 I did not know that.  And you moved a little because of the Russians in Brooklyn.  It's a melting pot open.  We lived in a pretty much Italian neighborhood, and now it's Russian all over.  And the funny thing is our house used to, you know, we used to have our garbage cans next to each other,  and you could look in their recycling bin.  All alcoholics.  You know, the day before the recycling truck came, all alcohol, malt liquor, whiskey, anything, whatever you want to think of.  All drugs.  Yeah.  What was the final straw that said, you know what, I got to get the hell out of Brooklyn? 
[39:00]
 We just were getting tired of not knowing our neighbors.  And actually one I remember was a work night.  I had to get up really early in the morning, and it was the middle of the summer,  and they're in the backyard with like doing like a campfire thing with guitars, and they're singing.  Me and my wife just looked at each other and said, no, that's it.  We're out of here.  Old Russian songs they used to sing as they paraded the missiles through Red Square.  Nice.  All right, Lou, thank you.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  There goes Lou.  Whoa, let's go to Phil. 
[39:30]
 Phil, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Phil.  Yo, it's Bill. What's up, guys?  Hi, Bill.  Yo, I got two comments.  First, Mission to Mars.  I go with five guys and one girl.  Best thing, my friend Jay.  Sitting there, and you know how the black guys survive?  Yeah.  My friend Rob goes, why the hell does he get to live?  Of course, we're sitting by like five, six, ten, twenty.  The whole theater is full of them.  Oh my gosh, full of them.  Yes.  And my friend Jay, who is the nicest guy in the world, belts out because he's black. 
[40:00]
 I was like, oh man.  Wow.  And yeah.  The movie blew?  Yeah, it was terrible, man.  It was the biggest waste of $9.  I swear to God.  It was just a bad movie.  There was nothing.  It sucked.  The story sucked.  At least you didn't have a guy in your ear.  I know.  And wait, wait.  Talking about in the rear and cell phones.  No, I said in your ear.  Oh, in the ear.  I'm sorry.  That's what I've been saying.  Of course.  But cell phones.  Listen to this.  I'm on spring break. 
[40:30]
 I go to Stevens and Hoboken, right?  And I got a doctor's appointment today.  Of course, with my father, he takes off work, so we've got to go to the proctologist.  And this is no joke.  My dad's on the table.  I'm out in the waiting room.  The doctor's cell phone rings while my dad's being examined.  Okay, terrific.  I'm on a cell phone right now and I'm outside because my father hates these things.  And of course, the damn thing rings when he's on the table.  And you love that.  Love that feedback. 
[41:00]
 Unbelievable.  I'll break his microphone one of these days.  Slamming that thing.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  I'm going to go to the proctologist now.  Thank you.  Alright.  Bye-bye.  Live mission to Mars, father gets the pipe story.  Let's go to Natalie.  Hi, guys.  This is Natalia.  Hey.  Natalia.  I stormed into Mars this weekend and that's two and a half hours of my life that I'm never  getting back.  Yeah, see?  I'm really upset about that.  It was the number one movie in the country. 
[41:30]
 Watch the drop off next week.  That's like one of those movies where they show all the good parts in the preview and  the movie blows.  Yeah, like Gary Sinise's Cole and stuff.  It looked like there was going to be some good special effects.  I feel like I know Gary Sinise's face like the back of my hand.  I don't know how many more angles they could shoot Gary Sinise's face from.  One guy in Line 9 says, who was the guy with the eyeliner and then the Mars guy?  Gary Sinise.  That was Gary, right?  At one point he was wearing eyeliner, face makeup and what looked to be lip gloss, I  swear to God it looked like he was doing a drag scene and they just pulled the wig off. 
[42:00]
 It was awful.  He had that much makeup on his face.  They all had like lip gloss on the whole movie.  They did just come out of a cat stick commercial.  You know the makeup in today's movies have gotten really, really bad.  More than not you can see the makeup on these actors' faces and stuff.  Like the guys wearing the lipstick and stuff.  It's terrible.  Well I just wanted to say too that the other night I was at a dinner with my parents who  were suddenly my father's birthday and we're sitting there in this really fancy restaurant  eating dinner and I start going, Killa Kitten. 
[42:30]
 I start singing Killa Kitten then, like dinner with my parents.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, it was good.  My brother is singing Baby Rafer with his friends and freshman year.  It's great.  Cool, thanks.  You know what I had stuck in my head all weekend?  The most offensive song you'll ever hear.  I sing that one in the shower all the time.  All freaking weekend.  That's funny man.  You guys rock.  I wanted to kill myself.  In case of now.  The one I had stuck was Kill a Feet, it's done a footloose.  Yeah?  It doesn't get any better than that. 
[43:00]
 They just get stuck in your head man.  Catchy little ditties.  So when are the cool movies going to be in the theaters?  I walk by the movie theater every weekend and I'm like, I look up, see what I want to see.  I don't want to see any of this crap.  I'm going to go see American Beauty again.  Yeah, because it's back in the theaters.  I'd rather see that again than any of the movies that are out.  They re-release the ones that are Oscar nominees.  And then I guess right about now before the Oscars come out and they don't really release anything.  You have to wait until after. 
[43:30]
 You just saved me some serious cash.  I'm not going to go see Mission to Mars.  Yeah, it looked like from the commercials it looked like it was going to be good.  Blue.  Blue.  The preview looked great.  Yeah, seems cool.  All right.  Blue.  Let's go to Joe.  He hates Russians too, Anthony.  Here we go.  Joe, you're next.  What's up?  Joe!  You're on.  Don't listen to the radio.  Hello?  You're on the radio, loser.  Now let me tell you something, buddy.  I freaking hate Russians more than anybody on the planet.  Oh yeah?  We can't even go anywhere, these people. 
[44:00]
 They're all over the place.  And Brooklyn, forget about it.  Hey, Rich?  Have you ever been in Century 21?  No.  Sucks.  Just going anywhere?  No.  Thank you.  Why do you hate...  All right, goodbye.  Bye.  I waited 20 minutes to say nothing.  Larry, you're next on WNEW.  What's going on?  Hey, ONA, what's going on?  How are you?  It's Al.  Listen, didn't see Mission to Mars.  However, I did see that stupid mammoth thing.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it. 
[44:30]
 I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  The cool thing was those Indians, whatever the hell they are. 
[45:00]
 They're Eskimos.  I don't know.  They look like Eskimos.  I don't know if they were.  The only thing I could think of is where the hell did they get cigarettes and how did they  take a crap?  I mean, they live in a park.  These people, oh man, they live in the middle of just nowhere.  Really?  In these ice huts, they have their frozen fish on the roof of their ice huts.  Great.  Anyway, these Eskimo people or whatever they are, they found two huge woolly mammoth tusks, 
[45:30]
 Anthony.  Yeah.  Which I didn't know before last night.  It's pretty common to find remains of the woolly mammoth in that area.  I did not know that.  I thought it was pretty rare to find any piece of a woolly mammoth in this day and age.  Well, woolly mammoths aren't like dinosaurs, which are millions of years old.  They're only, what, like 20,000, 30,000 years old.  This thing was like 22,000 years old at some point.  They've been extinct for what, 10,000 to 12,000 years, they said last night, something like  that.  Does that make sense?  Yeah. 
[46:00]
 But I was surprised.  I thought it was a pretty rare thing to find any piece of a woolly mammoth.  Probably in one piece.  But these Eskimos or whatever, they find the bones all the time.  They're making weapons and stuff out of them like it's no big freaking deal.  So they find the two big, huge woolly mammoth tusks, Anthony.  So this scientific, the expedition finds the people and they go, all right, where did you  find the tusks?  So they go out in the middle of nowhere and they use some radar equipment and they realize  that there's a whole woolly mammoth under the ground.  Dude, bad though. 
[46:30]
 That thing was so bad it wasn't even funny.  Really?  Oh, it was, oh God.  So then, did you hear that thing, No Way to Land, that was on TBS or whatever?  Oh, what, that movie?  The airplane going through the, you know.  Didn't say it.  Got the poison gas.  He wants to go to another movie.  I know.  Are we talking about the woolly mammoth or?  Yeah, yeah.  You're last acid flashback.  Well, you know, he wants to talk about another movie.  All right, so we all thought that this helicopter was going to raise a complete woolly mammoth. 
[47:00]
 That was Ice Cube.  Yeah, it was a block, they raised a block of ice after two hours.  I thought I was going to see a woolly mammoth.  Why didn't they defrost it?  Because they don't want to defrost it because they want to try to clone this thing.  Well, can't they defrost it, see what it looks like and put it in a freezer or something?  No, what they're going to do is they're going to bring it into the ice caves or something  in the middle of Russia and then they're going to like start chipping away and then maybe  eventually we'll see what this thing looks like.  Well, maybe they should have made the documentary after they chipped it out of it. 
[47:30]
 Exactly.  Because the posters and everything made it look like they were going to raise this thing  up and you're going to be like, holy crap, that's a woolly freaking mammoth.  They take the tusk, right?  It turns out that the head of this creature is no longer around because that piece of  the animal was above the lake or the pond that it fell in and it rotted away.  The rest of it froze forever here.  So they take the tusk they found and they just stick it in the block of ice so when  they raise it up with this huge helicopter it looks like there might be a complete woolly 
[48:00]
 mammoth in there but it wasn't.  It was just a headless woolly mammoth with a stupid tusk sticking out of a block of ice.  You saw nothing.  It was a waste of time.  I missed the sopranos last night.  Yeah, it was bad.  I missed everything because it was a stupid mammoth.  Like you said, you saw the fur of the woolly mammoth and the guys taking a hairdryer and  blowing stuff and that was kind of cool because they estimated this woolly mammoth was like  20,000 years old and you could still see the fur of the thing.  The other guy was so excited because it smelled like dung and urine and that's kind of when 
[48:30]
 I was like, okay.  Okay, terrific.  But it was a complete waste of time.  Yeah, it was bad.  Alright guys, take it in the rear.  Bye.  Bye.  Alright man, we've got to take a break.  Alright.  We've got, actually this is, hold on, there it is, some feedback from Damon from Manhattan.  Huge wow and okay terrific signs on the Today Show this morning on NBC. 
[49:00]
 Oh yeah.  And I also saw We Deliver Kegers on NBC's Today Show this morning and a bunch of other  signs.  Cool.  Well the people that attacked the Today Show, some of those Psycho Mark psychopaths, they  are right outside the studio Anthony with all the signs they had on the Today Show this  morning.  We've got to talk to them.  And we'll do that next.  Stay there.  OP and Anthony.  Well you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be gone heroin. 
[49:30]
 OP and Anthony.  You know, I don't like them after I watch.  Be evil and love.  1027 WNEW.  I could be a first on our show.  Yeah.  I'm a sweeper Anthony.  Hey is this Limp Bizkit in?  I do believe it's trust by Limp Bizkit.  You know it's funny, speaking of Limp Bizkit, Friday night go over to pick up some food 
[50:00]
 over at the Hard Rock, bring it back to the station, hang out, eat.  I go over there, I'm waiting for the food.  There's a table full of girls like 14, 15 years old.  And George Michael's fate comes up on the screen and he's dancing.  You gotta have faith.  And they're saying, who's this fag ripping off Limp Bizkit?  I was dying.  And some guy that was with him said, no, no, Limp Bizkit did it second. 
[50:30]
 He was the first one that did it.  This is an old video.  Yeah, they cut it.  And they wouldn't believe it.  They're like, no way.  Who's this fag ripping off Limp Bizkit?  I of course felt like a great grandfather.  It makes you feel old when that happens.  Then I went over to the table and offered him a drink.  Limp Bizkit working on a new album, Anthony.  Yes.  It'll be out 4th of July, it looks like.  And they're going to have a track on the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack which comes out May  9th.  Another movie that is probably going to blow.  Definitely going to blow.  Dave, what's up? 
[51:00]
 How are you doing guys?  Good, what's up?  Good, nothing.  Listen, there are a couple of good movies that you guys are missing the boat on.  OK.  Ninth Gate came out on the weekend.  Let me tell you something.  The pedophile knows how to make a movie.  Roman Polanski.  Roman Polanski.  His wife is in it.  She is hot.  Maybe one of the best set of nipples I've ever seen in my life.  How old is she?  About 34 now maybe.  She was in Frantic.  I think he married her and then put her in that movie.  And I haven't seen her since.  But she is still a piece.  Roman's setting the sights a little higher than 14.  Yeah, for once. 
[51:30]
 Well, Nino from the Bronx on the Instant Feedback.  Bro, do not watch the Ninth Gate.  It blows so bad, man.  The best part is when she is screwing besides that it was such a piece of ass.  No, the thing keeps you riveted.  I mean it kind of sticks at the end a little bit.  You may not like the last one second of the movie.  But it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  The man knows how to make a thriller.  And aside from that, Anthony, if you like space movies, have you seen Pitch Black?  I did.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. 
[52:00]
 So that was a decent movie.  And how about The Boiler Room?  That I'm waiting.  That's the only one I've seen.  That's the only one I want to see is The Boiler Room.  You've got to see it quick.  It's not going to be out that much longer.  But for two guys that play the market, the movie is great and it's filmed locally.  Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, it's all familiar territory for all of us.  I've heard nothing but good things about The Boiler Room.  Unreal.  You've got to go see Vin Diesel.  The guy from Pitch Black is also in Boiler Room.  But I mean, am I going to go see The Whole Nine Yards or The Cider House Rules?  No.  No.  What gender are you?  My dog Skip.  I'm not seeing this crap. 
[52:30]
 Who needs that?  Now, the movies are up to like 10 bucks a pop.  I've got to pick my movies wisely.  You know what the problem was with the 2000s?  Some of these movies, I swear to God, you should be able to get your money back after spending 10 bucks on a ticket.  The bad thing about The Mission to Mars is they played the 2001 angle.  It's like a cheap workbook of 2001 but without the psychedelia.  Yeah, it was kind of lame.  I don't know what they were going for.  I don't know.  And the whole thing seemed really kind of silly and hokey.  Yeah, I know.  My girlfriend told me she almost committed suicide seeing that. 
[53:00]
 Anyway, boys, you're shripped.  All right, thanks, Dick.  Take care.  I just say thanks to all of it now.  I don't even know what it means.  Let's go to Robin.  Robin, you're next on WNEW.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good today.  Wow, that voice is shaking your head up.  Listen, you didn't really miss so much on the sopranos last night.  Well, I was too busy watching the raising of the woolly mammoth.  It turns out to be a block of ice.  How do I know there's a woolly mammoth inside?  Well, first of all, it's the Discovery Channel and it sucks.  What a waste of time. 
[53:30]
 I'm still pissed.  Then there's a commercial, then you're sucked into the raising of the  woolly mammoth.  They go to a commercial, so I quickly go to HBO to check out sopranos.  I'm like, damn, this is looking pretty good, but now I can't turn on the  sopranos halfway through.  What did you say?  Well, you know what?  I saw the last five minutes and I got everyone pissed off in my living room.  Well, put it this way.  They found the guy, they shot him.  I know.  That's the scene I saw.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie.  They shot him.  I know.  That's the scene I saw. 
[54:00]
 That's it.  And then Chris thought he went to hell, but he didn't go to hell.  Yeah.  It was boring.  You really didn't miss any.  Well, maybe it was probably better.  Obviously, it was better than the Discovery Channel, but still.  Well, the good news, though, I mean, they run the sopranos every  night of the week, so I'll catch you one day this week.  I know.  All right.  Don't worry.  Syndication now, guys.  Thank you, Robin.  I thought I was watching the raising of the woolly mammoth thing, but it  was just an old clip from the view of Star Jones walking in the snow.  I was watching for like a good 10 minutes before I realized it wasn't the 
[54:30]
 woolly mammoth.  This isn't the raising of the woolly mammoth.  Where are the tusks?  No tusks.  What a waste of time.  I'm pissed.  Yeah, sometimes you just waste a couple of hours and you're hoping the end  justifies it.  You're just assuming that it's going to get better, you know?  Yeah.  You know what was good?  I rented this.  The Boondock Saints with Willem Dafoe.  Couple of Irish guys in South Boston killing guys from the Russian mob.  That was a good rental. 
[55:00]
 I checked that one out.  Yeah, all that stuff.  Yeah, Southie and all that.  Southie.  Yeah, a couple of Irish guys.  And it's so funny.  I read it and it's like a couple of Irish guys from Southie fighting the  Russian mob moving into their neighborhood.  The first dude, before the end of the credits, and I swear this is true,  before the end of the credits, they were already fighting and drunk.  And the credits were still rolling.  It was the first two minutes of the movie.  They're drunk and fighting. 
[55:30]
 Psycho Mark was giving me all the Southie talk all weekend long.  Psycho Mark originally from Southie.  South Boston.  Which is a very, very Irish area.  Born on A Street, raised on B Street.  I'm from Southie.  We hate all you, you know what?  You can say it.  Very racist up there.  All the Russians, they suck.  Yeah, they don't only hate the Russians.  You can say it.  Southie is one of the most racist areas in the entire country.  Keep all your niggas in Rocksbury and Rochester. 
[56:00]
 All the gooks, though.  We hate them slant nights.  Any of you colored come to Southie.  You're going to get your eyes handed to you.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  We went to Southie on St. Patrick's Day a few years ago.  That was two years ago.  Oh, my God.  At the parade, they throw bottles at the gays.  Because the gays have to march.  Hey, you effing faggot.  Get out of that parade.  This is our neighborhood, our parade. 
[56:30]
 Get out, you faggot.  We'll kick you in the balls.  And then it's just great.  Walking home from the Southie St. Patrick's Day parade,  it's playing pew cop scotch.  It's just vomit in the streets.  One thing they didn't do in Southie is triple parking.  It's a great feature.  Triple parking.  That's nice.  This is all the stuff I had to hear this weekend with Psycho Mark.  They triple park to go into the bars, right?  They triple park.  If you're double parked, you're screwed. 
[57:00]
 They'll triple park you right in.  If you're parked next to the curb, forget about it.  You're done.  You better drive on the sidewalk.  The best is the 14-year-old mother's world.  The best is the 14-year-old mother's walking around with the babies  in the baby carriages and they all come up to each other.  Do you go to my fed Bobby's house?  I'm going to kick you in the can before.  I'm going to punch you in the teeth.  Meanwhile, they get their baby sitting right there  and they're slapping the piss out of each other.  And the babies are crying.  And they're like 14 with their sneakers on. 
[57:30]
 It's just like the Saturday Night Live bit, man.  You live that bit.  You have no idea.  I used to live next to this basketball court.  They'd be playing basketball until 3 in the morning.  Bobby, get your ass in the house, you stupid bastard.  I'll kick your ass, you stupid little faggot.  They'd be screaming and yelling.  Boston's hysterical like that.  They like to come across as Mayor Menino up there.  Boston is a very diverse city.  The guy talks like this.  His tongue is like a cow tongue. 
[58:00]
 You ever go to the store and see cow tongue sitting there?  Take cow tongue, shove it in big fat man's mouth.  There you have Menino.  Boston is very diverse.  It's a virtual melting pot.  Yeah, virtual melting pot, diverse.  And it's so segregated.  All that diversity is chain linked off to each other.  You go to Roxbury, you go to Dorchester, you got the blacks.  Saudi, you got the Irish.  North End, you got the Italian.  And don't cross lines, man.  They will kick your ass. 
[58:30]
 It's the most segregated city in the world.  It truly is.  In the country, I do believe.  It's amazing.  Saudi, we love Saudi.  We go there for the take back, believe.  I drink a lot.  It is one of the most racist cities you'll ever go to.  Mike, what's going on?  I went to undergrad up there.  You went to undergrad in Boston?  Yeah, I'm a black man too.  And I'm telling you, this week, you hibernate.  It's true, man.  You don't want to come out. 
[59:00]
 They say, why aren't you wearing something green?  We say, F the green.  Oh, that's a good thing.  That's the green.  All right.  I brought the Irish pile on the nigger.  Pile on the nigger.  We get our revenge because somebody always gets housed.  A carload of Irish kids always house one of our boys.  And what we would always do is go play ball in one of the white neighborhoods  and purposely start a fight after it.  Correct.  The second Mark was telling me this weekend that there was some kind of racial incident  where they used to throw bananas at the school buses. 
[59:30]
 Holy smoke.  In Saudi?  In Saudi?  Oh my God.  Let me give a community belt.  I was in undergrad during busting up there.  It was wild.  It's still wild.  You guys got that right.  Yeah, it's one of the most racist cities you'll ever go to.  They try and hide it.  They say now 51% of the voting population in Boston was born and raised outside of Massachusetts.  Yeah, but the verbal ones, the real vocal people, are still the locals. 
[60:00]
 And they're berserk.  They are berserk.  Saudi is a scary little area, man.  And we try to keep the colors out.  Yeah, but you know what?  There's no reason, there's still no reason to be black and in that neighborhood after 5 p.m.  I mean, a lot of people work there.  But there's nothing there.  I know.  I kind of say, like, look, leave them alone in their little community.  Yeah, well, and a lot of the white guys don't go to Roxbury or Dorchester.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  It's like so segregated. 
[60:30]
 Amazing.  Let's bring this up.  Hey, nothing, bud.  Yeah, kick us out because we said that you were dead and you weren't really, you stupid mayor.  But he's got a city running there like they might as well just set up barbed wire, some  concertina wire, and mounted 50 cows at the border every town.  Keep out, stay out, you niggas.  We'll shoot you.  Say how?  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What up?  Listen, I live in Brooklyn, right?  And we got a neighborhood in Brooklyn called Garrison Beach. 
[61:00]
 It's like the Brooklyn equivalent of Southie.  Lowlife Irish shanty living.  I hate them.  I hate them.  All right.  We have our own hatred right here in New York, too.  You know what?  The Russians, the Russians, they're like upper class people compared to the Irish that live  in Garrison Beach.  The inbred, they marry their cousins.  They all live on the same block.  Man, what part of Brooklyn you living now?  I ain't telling you. 
[61:30]
 Well, don't go to Garrison Beach or they'll see your dog can't edit.  Think you're Puerto Rican.  Yeah, that happens anyway.  Listen, listen.  Opie, I know you're Irish.  You know, no hard feelings.  I'm not Irish.  I look Irish.  Really?  Don't doubt it.  We can't say that.  I know the reason why Anthony doesn't know anything about basketball.  All right.  Because his mother never slept with a basketball player.  Very funny.  But you're right.  All right.  Take care, fellas.  Bye. 
[62:00]
 You know, those kids have been patiently waiting out there for like an hour.  We've got to get them in next.  They had all sorts of signs on the Today Show this morning, Anthony.  We'll get into that in just a few minutes, I promise.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony, in my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  Hey, Anthony Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA wants to send you to the  Final Four. 
[62:30]
 Yeah.  Finally, we got all the teams up on the WNAW website, right, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  This is a great, great thing.  We got all the teams up on www.wnaw.com.  You register.  You have to pick which four teams are going to the Final Four, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you have your Final Four picks?  I know 14th-seeded Iona.  You're going for Iona?  Yeah, that's right.  Iona?  Yeah, that's one of my picks.  And then I'll throw in a few more.  I'm going with the retard verdict. 
[63:00]
 What do you mean?  Well, Spazz is from Iona.  Where's my pick?  So I think they're just going to win as like a goof.  So I have them picked.  No offense to our Iona listeners.  They're not going to win anything.  No, huh?  St. John's, baby!  Oh, yeah?  St. John's!  Nothing's ever happened like that?  The Redmond!  Screw this Red Storm crack.  A 14th-seeded thing?  No, that's a number one.  That bad?  So many white people on the team?  What is it?  What's the problem?  Iona?  I think it's... 
[63:30]
 Spazz is tall.  There's something in the water, I think.  I don't know.  Iona's going nowhere.  My four picks, Anthony.  Ready?  Okay.  Here's Hope's picks.  Duke?  Yeah.  Looking real good over the weekend.  St. John's?  St. John's.  Got to go for St. John's.  No, I got my picks.  I'm also going with Connecticut.  UConn?  UConn.  And I think I have to go Syracuse this year.  All right.  Those are your picks.  Yes.  I'll have to pick the Reds. 
[64:00]
 Wait, you got a list of all of them there?  Yeah.  Let me take a look.  College basketball and Anthony.  This should be interesting.  Let me take a look.  I do have to point out, I'm not really going for many underdogs.  I mean, Duke's number one in their seed, UConn's fifth, Syracuse's fourth, and St. John's is  two.  I'm going for all favorites this year.  Okay.  Yeah, you're not really going out on a limb there.  No, I'm not going out on a limb, Anthony.  Okay.  So you're picking Iona, which is one of your picks.  Okay, three more. 
[64:30]
 Do you know what bracket Iona's in?  I'm looking.  I'm looking at that one.  Okay.  No.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  So you can't pick another team in that bracket.  I'm going with that one.  All right.  And then I'm thinking Cincinnati.  That's not a bad pick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cincinnati had a pretty good year.  Okay.  A very good year.  Who am I saying?  And then, how about Lamar?  Lamar?  Lamar? 
[65:00]
 15 and 15.  Come on, stop fooling around.  Okay.  By the way, stop fooling around.  Iona is a stupid pick.  Cincinnati's okay.  I can accept that.  Give me two more.  You can't pick Lamar.  Is Iona bad because the whole division they're in just blows monkey ass?  Because Iona's like 29 and 4.  Yeah.  So that sounds good on the outside.  If you're playing midgets.  Iona had a good year, but they don't really play any of the powerhouses, Anthony.  Oh, you watch.  I have faith.  Okay. 
[65:30]
 Their schedule's a little weaker than some of the others.  I'll say Cincinnati.  Cincinnati is a pretty good pick.  And then let me go with one of our hometown favorites, Hofstra.  Hofstra?  Wait, Mike on line 9 is saying my picks suck.  Mike, why do my picks suck?  You hear what Anthony's picking?  I know.  I didn't get to hear Anthony's picking.  Anthony's picking.  Wait, let me give you Anthony's picks.  He wants Iona.  He wants Lamar.  He wants Hofstra and he's going with Cincinnati.  No, no. 
[66:00]
 I took out Lamar for Hofstra.  Oh, okay.  That's better.  That's much better.  That's a good pick, Mike.  No, no, no.  They're just their best player.  Who is that?  He's just their best player.  I don't know.  I don't know anything about this.  This is all I'm saying.  Mike, what's the problem you have with my picks?  It's just that you seem to think that the Big East is going to go pretty much 3 out of 4 there.  Why not? 
[66:30]
 Why not?  It's happened before.  It's happened before, but not this time.  And Purdue, because I like the chicken.  You've got to throw St. John's in there because I've always supported St. John's.  They're peaking right at the right opportunity here at the right time.  They play down to their teams though.  They play up to their teams against the Duke game.  What's your four picks really fast?  I don't have the sheet in front of me right now, but I have Duke.  Well, Duke, see, I have Duke.  Yeah, I think Duke is going to win all the way this year. 
[67:00]
 UConn is my long shot.  UConn is my little light.  Yeah, that's a tough shot right there.  Yeah, I think so.  And St. John's, you know, come on.  Yeah, they're going to win this year.  He's had a good year too.  The Big East had a strong year.  They really don't have that strong of a team to go play all those games straight.  I'd have to get back to you on my picks.  I've got to check the other things.  Well, make sure you register for this contest.  I damn right I am.  All right, so do you have my picks? 
[67:30]
 Are they written down somewhere?  Write them down.  Here it is, Anthony's picks.  I'm going with Hofstra.  Okay.  Dude, I will give you a hundred bucks if one of your picks makes it to the final four.  If one of them makes it to the final four?  I will give you a hundred bucks per pick that makes it to the final four.  Would you give me a hundred bucks back?  No, you've got to give me odds if they're so stupid.  I'll give you 25 bucks.  A hundred bucks?  All right, you give me a hundred.  If none of the four make it in, I give you 25.  Four to one odds. 
[68:00]
 Both ways.  You're picking just like I am.  You've got to give me odds.  All right, then be confident and give me a hundred bucks per team that makes it into  the final four each way.  Four to one odds.  I give you 25.  Don't have much money you made today.  That's some language.  You can call me a cheap ass.  Wait a minute.  You're a cheap bastard.  Now let's do it.  A hundred dollars per team that makes it into the final four either way.  Wait, your team's a good team. 
[68:30]
 So pick better teams.  No, these are my team.  You're going to say that my teams are going to be the final four?  All right.  What's the deal?  I guess I'll pay off the winnings on that cruise ship money that you're supposed to  give me.  I've got to chip into that 600 today.  Come on, help me out here.  Okay, all right, here are my picks.  Here's Anthony's four picks for the final four. 
[69:00]
 All right, Hofstra.  Hofstra.  Cincinnati.  The people are laughing.  Wait, Aaron doesn't like your Cincinnati pick.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  What is Ann on Dope?  I know.  The best player, he's got eight.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  Don't worry, we're only going to do one break on the NCAA.  Oh, thanks.  You know what I'm going for here?  Cincinnati is kind of a bad pick, Ann. 
[69:30]
 Yeah, he's only got their best players.  They're the ones that know nothing about racing and they place a bet at the window.  What happens?  They lose.  The goddamn horse comes in, they pick a cute name or something, or they like the color  of the horse seat, and the damn thing wins.  I know nothing about college ball.  Ann's the cute girl at the track right now.  That's me.  I'm the hot babe at the track.  What a loser.  I'm not even going to explain myself. 
[70:00]
 All right, thank you.  All right, yeah, Cincinnati is a bad pick.  I don't care.  Hofstra, Cincinnati, and my favorite, I think going all the way, Iona.  And then last but not least, I'm picking Purdue because I just love the chicken.  Those oven stuffer roasters.  All right, Ann, this is what I'm going to do.  After hearing your picks, I will give you $200.  Whoa, two to one odds.  $200 per pick that makes it into the Final Four.  In turn, you will give me $100 per pick that makes it into the Final Four. 
[70:30]
 Agreed?  Agreed.  My picks once again, St. John's, Syracuse, Yukon, a lot of Big East in there, and Duke.  Okay.  All right, and yours, just for the record, one more time.  Hofstra, Cincinnati, Iona, and Purdue.  I'm rocking now.  I think the guys flipped the net.  James doesn't like either of our picks. 
[71:00]
 James?  Yeah?  Not at all.  All right, I got Stanford, I got Michigan State, going the whole way.  I was this close to taking Michigan State today.  Yeah, I got St. John's, though.  My dad went to St. John's and we're a big St. John's family, and that's definitely one we're taking.  And then on the other side, I got either Duke or Temple.  I'm pretty up in arms with that.  So if you take Duke, then you got two of my picks in the Final Four, so why are my picks bad? 
[71:30]
 I was really going after Anthony.  Oh, well, his are just ridiculous.  Iona, come on, Ann.  Come on.  Those are the teams that make it a couple rounds and you start getting all excited, and then they finally show what they're really made of, and they suck.  And Cincinnati, Ann, come on, don't you listen to sports center?  Not at all.  They never talk about that on Squawk Box on CMU2.  All right, well thank you, James. 
[72:00]
 Yeah, I was the guy who called on Friday about the wild sign and my friend getting in trouble.  All right, on.  It's in the case and out, guys.  All right, well you know the deal, though.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  We have all the 64 teams on the www.wniw.com website, okay?  You go there between now and Thursday at noon and you decide which four teams are going to make it into the Final Four, okay, Anthony?  Those people will be going to the Final Four live, courtesy of Opie and Anthony, and Mountain Dew. 
[72:30]
 Nice.  Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA.  So if you're not doing anything now, make sure you register by going to www.wniw.com, okay?  Right.  So do the Dew with Mountain Dew and listen to us to win a trip to the Final Four.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're talking college basketball a little bit there, Anthony.  Yes, we are.  A lot of people confused about your Final Four picks. 
[73:00]
 Let's go to Keith.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, Anthony, why don't you pick Wine Dance High School while you're at it also?  Wine Dance probably wouldn't do for too bad.  Hey, Wine Dance always had a good team.  We played those bastards in high school.  Now, Great Neck.  Wine Dance, no, I don't think so.  Great Neck probably doesn't have a good team.  Wine Dance probably doesn't.  They had armed guards that would, I'm not even kidding, bring us from the bus to our locker room.  They'd have armed guards in the locker room. 
[73:30]
 They had armed guards behind the bench when we played back in the 80s.  Sounds like a real good area.  And the town had a curfew.  They weren't allowed out after dark.  At the time, I'm not kidding.  So what do you got for your picks, Opie?  What?  What do you got for your picks?  We went through that already.  All right, I think Duke's going all the way.  And Syracuse.  I like Duke and St. John's.  I like LSU too, a little sleeper from St. John's bracket.  I also like Michigan State, but I couldn't fit them into my final four picks there. 
[74:00]
 Keith?  Well, so Kentucky, you guys get that stat every year.  Kentucky wins.  Yankees win the World Series in the same year.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so I got to roof it with Kentucky a little bit.  All right, guys.  Well, make sure you pick your final four at www.com because we are sending someone to the final four live.  All right, you guys suck.  All right, man.  Ant?  Yeah, we got a little studio over there.  And oh my God, through the middle of town.  What is that?  Straight path.  Straight path, right through the center of Winedan. 
[74:30]
 You just begged for three green lights in a row, man.  And no train.  The train is the worst.  You could go through the red lights and you get stuck in the train tracks.  Explain that.  Straight path is like the main street of Winedan.  It goes right through Winedan.  They have three or four lights, a couple blocks apart, okay?  And then a train station.  Yeah.  And then you got stopped at a red light while a train was coming.  Yeah.  You're screwed.  You lock your doors. 
[75:00]
 You're just frightful for your life.  And then I'm driving home.  All of a sudden I hear a couple of pops.  This huge crowd comes running across straight path.  I'm right in the middle of it and I'm hearing gunfire.  I read the paper the next day.  Someone got shot, killed.  And I was right there.  And meanwhile I'm in the company van that I'm not supposed to be driving.  Thank you.  Apollo Air Conditioning.  Hey, everyone does it.  If they tell you they don't, they're lying. 
[75:30]
 I'm kidding.  My pal's down there.  I was driving the Apollo van and I'm just going like,  how am I going to explain a bullet hole in the Apollo van?  And I searched the whole van over and thank God it didn't get hit.  But it was the last time I ever drove through one.  Yeah, that's a scary area.  Really scary area.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you, Brian?  Good. How are you guys doing? 
[76:00]
 I got two things.  First of all, Spad is a retard.  Please get somebody with more than a peanut for a brain to work the phones.  We all know that by now.  And you're second.  It took me forever to get through.  Okay, second of all, Anthony, grow some balls and become a man.  What's that?  None. I told you I have no basketball knowledge, but I don't think...  It's at least honest.  He hates basketball, doesn't want anything to do with it.  What are you doing in your spare time? Basket weave?  No, what is it? Basketball and nothing else?  What do you do? 
[76:30]
 Are you one of those one-dimensional people that only can talk basketball?  I hate that.  Hey, did you see that?  Boy, they're not interested in basketball.  I guess I have nothing else to talk about.  All right, guys.  This is one of the things that Ant finds interesting.  No, that's cool.  All right, guys. You guys are great.  Thank you.  It's basketball Brian, everybody.  Let's go to Sean. Sean, you're next on WNEW.  Anthony, you are a moron.  Really? 
[77:00]
 Iona opens up against Maryland Terrapins.  I'm not a moron. I'm ignorant.  ACC told me yesterday.  They just don't stand a chance in hell.  Go, Iona.  Maryland folded like a cheap tent yesterday, though, man.  You're going to owe Anthony $400.  Me?  I'm sorry. Anthony is going to go owe OP $400.  I think we have a pretty good bet.  For every team of mine that makes it to the final four,  Anthony is going to give me $100.  And for every team that Anthony gets into the final four, 
[77:30]
 I'm going to give him $200.  So if all your teams get in, you'll only owe me $200.  Well, that's okay. Better than $600.  Okay, you got some good choices.  All right, Sean. Thank you.  Yeah, but they're conservative choices.  I really wanted one of those, you know, the wild-car team,  but I just didn't see any there, really.  All right?  Thank you.  Let's go back to the wine dance area.  Mary has a good story.  Mary, what's up?  I travel this road home every freaking night. 
[78:00]
 Straight path right through wine dance.  Right through wine dance, right over the railroad tracks,  make a right over on Acorn Street,  and I got stuck.  Going to Long Island Avenue.  Yeah.  Let me interrupt you real fast, Mary.  I got stuck at the railroad tracks one night,  two in the morning, coming home from BAB  because that was the shortcut to BAB when I was working there.  Uh-huh.  Holy cow, I just jumped.  I swear to God, no jump.  Holy cow, that freaked me out, Ant.  Sorry, man. 
[78:30]
 Oh, my God, my heart stopped.  I'm like, we're on the 10th floor.  Where's the gunshots go from?  Oh, it really freaks me out.  Dude, you got me so bad.  Oh, cool.  I swear to you.  So I'm at that light, and it's raining like a mother.  You see me jump?  Oh, my God.  I wasn't expecting that.  That's crazy.  So I was at the train tracks.  The train thing comes down, it's a red light.  It's pouring like a mother. 
[79:00]
 And this poor, helpless woman comes knocking on my sidewalk  and I rolled down the window a couple inches.  I had a left rubber right into the side of the train.  Well, I was scared because there was nowhere you could go  if you know this area.  You can't turn around, you can't do anything.  You have to wait for that train to pass.  You don't get carjacked.  That's why you leave enough room for a U-turn  in front of you, in front of that gate.  I'm dashing the train.  So this lady comes to me and she goes,  my car broke down and I need a jump. 
[79:30]
 And she is as dark as night.  Oh, my God, what does that have to do with this story, Ophi?  Dark as night.  So I go, well, where's your car?  She goes, oh, it's over there.  She's pointing to this area that's just completely empty parking lot.  She goes, it's around the corner there.  Oh, yeah.  Does it look like I was born yesterday?  Yeah, you go over there.  So now I'm sitting there like, what the hell am I going to do?  I can't say no because I'm still stuck in the light.  I don't know, if they were planning something,  maybe they're going to try something right there.  So I'm like, OK, I'll be right over. 
[80:00]
 As soon as that freaking gate went up  and I was like, OK, I'm going to go on.  Yeah, you'd have pulled up there, gotten out of your car.  Hey, I got jumper cables.  Call me Fred is whatever.  But I'm like, this situation doesn't look good.  You have no idea that place has gotten so bad.  I got stopped at the train.  I'm sitting there.  It's when I owned like this little 1982 Nissan Polestar.  It was like the first car I ever bought for like a hundred bucks.  I'm sitting there, putting along, I get caught at the train. 
[80:30]
 I'm sitting there like, OK, all of a sudden this crack head,  crack head, opens my passenger door.  Opens your passenger door.  He kicks in and says, hey baby, what's up?  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Now I'm using all my heart to my growth.  I'm like, now I'm dead.  I'm dead.  Why are you going through that area with your doors unlocked?  Well, I had the locks and stuff locked me on the drives.  What do you want me to do?  I'll see what you should have done.  You know what I'm saying? 
[81:00]
 So I told him, I'm undercover cop, you all get out right now.  I have my button right here.  He's like, oh baby, it's closed, it's closed, chill, chill, chill.  I was like, what are you kidding me?  It's just like the worst area you can ever be in.  Nonetheless, I don't even take that area home too much at night anymore.  I come home like at 5 o'clock.  Probably the worst spot on Long Island.  It is.  I work with a guy that, like all black guys, right?  I told him on my drive, I'm like, listen, he wanted to pick up something from me. 
[81:30]
 I said, well, you know, you can come down, take the train station to Wyandam.  He goes, what are you kidding me?  He goes, I live in South Jamaica.  I ain't even going to Wyandam.  I'm like, what?  It's horrible.  Well, guys, over and out, diamond dust, that Dreamweaver.  We'll talk to you later.  Thank you, Mary.  Bye.  Really fast.  Your final four picks, Anthony.  Of course.  He's going to tell us why. 
[82:00]
 They're the best.  I'll tell you why.  Any Tom, Dick and Harry can go ahead and pick the number one team in each bracket.  I kind of admitted that though.  I'm going for a lot of favorites, sure.  But you know, you're pulling the Syracuses in there, and that's where I went to school, so I'm cool with that.  But if you don't pick a couple of long shots, then you're not going to win.  This is the first year I'm not really going.  I usually pick one of those long shots, but this year I just don't see it happening.  Now remember, two years ago, Iona only lost the Syracuse by one point in the first round.  I know, Spaz had to tell us that during commercial break.  He had to remind us of that one. 
[82:30]
 Now I can go shoot myself in the head for thinking like him, but I appreciate it.  So you like Anthony's picks.  He's got Hofstra, Iona.  I don't even know the other two ridiculous picks.  He may not win the big money, but it's a bet he picked.  There you go, thank you.  You can't eat gutsy.  Gutsy, just like I play the market, my friend.  Got to have some balls to you.  Thank you, Eric.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on WAW. What's up? 
[83:00]
 How are you doing?  I was in Winegash, and I was stopped at the railroad trestle.  Some guy jumped on top of my hood and started banging on the top of my hood.  This stuff happens all the time down there.  I'm sure he wasn't at that new Disney drive-thru.  I don't know, he had a needle in his arm and he was screaming.  I was driving, it was the middle of the night.  Wait, Joe, you're exaggerating.  I'm not.  I'm definitely exaggerating.  Did the black guy even jump on your car, Joe? 
[83:30]
 No, I swear to God, he jumped on the hood of my car.  They should have an L train there, man.  That is the worst theory.  There should be no reason you have to stop for a train in that area.  There should be no reason you have to stop for a train in that area.  There should be an underpass, an overpass, I don't care what you build,  but no one should be stopping for trains in that area.  It should just be a groove in the road.  It's like a tall wall that you drive through.  Like the little thing that Luke had to go into in the Death Star. 
[84:00]
 That should be the strip of road through one day.  So you can just zip right through.  Sure.  Yeah, alright, thanks guys.  Thank you, Joe.  Alright, a lot of people have some great stories,  but we've got to get these people in.  They've been waiting forever.  Eddie, what's up?  Yo guys, what's going on?  My buddy Mike was cruising through one night and he's like a real psycho Italian.  He's got his window open and he's blasting heavy metal stuck at the light  at like one in the morning. 
[84:30]
 That's dangerous.  So guess what happens?  They unload on his car, like nine shots into his car.  They're all sitting on the guardrail at the MLK Health Center, right on the corner.  Is that right next to Mama's Soul Kitchen?  No, actually it's McDonald's now.  Oh, is it?  I remember driving past and there's Mama's Soul Kitchen.  It was Church's.  Yeah, they used to have a Church's fried chicken there.  They even burnt down the KFC down there. 
[85:00]
 What stretch of road that's probably a half mile long  has three goddamn fried chicken places on it?  I mean, is that really a stereotype?  Yeah.  Come on.  All right, Eddie, thank you.  Bye.  Couple more of these.  Rob, what's up? You're next.  I live over West Babylon, about four or five blocks away from the bridge  that goes into Wine Dam.  I own a business over there 
[85:30]
 that works for me  and I'd have to drive them home to the boonies,  which is like, forget straight path by the train station.  This is like in the back deep side streets of Wine Dam  that I'm driving this guy home one night  and a freaking crack house gets raided  while I'm sitting in his driveway next door.  And it's insane, man.  I've had 40 bottles thrown at my car.  Tell me, you don't belong here.  Get out here, white boy.  And you know what they winded about it, man.  Other than that, the town is useless.  There should be a bomb dropped on it. 
[86:00]
 I think they dumped out.  You could get a BJ for two bucks in that area.  Basically, actually, you could probably talk it down,  to be honest.  Alright, Rob.  Let's go to another Rob.  Rob, you're next on WNAW.  Yeah, I own a landscaping company.  I drive through there all the time.  And it's just crazy.  Even down the side streets,  I do one house there on a Monday  and it's just crazy.  The kids in the streets are crazy.  I was driving through and the kid wouldn't move his bike 
[86:30]
 so I had to run over his front tire  to get away from him.  They were surrounding me and stuff.  It was crazy.  There are parts of 110 that's happening too.  Where people walk in the middle of the street  and they don't feel like getting out of the way.  What is that about?  That's a whole new thing that's going on.  I couldn't believe it.  It was crazy.  Just walk across a main road real slow  and then look at you when you look annoyed.  Look at you.  And then you have to stop your car. 
[87:00]
 Yeah.  I mean that's ridiculous.  And you wait.  Oh, and you'll wait.  Yeah, because you're scared assless at that point.  The pastel colored houses.  Thank you, Rob.  You're welcome.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian's next on WNAW.  Hi, Brian.  Hey, what's up?  I'm a volunteer fireman out in Suffolk County, right?  So one night we had the Suffolk Emerald Society  and we got there, you know, we're there drinking beers, 
[87:30]
 we eat, we had the meeting, we're leaving.  He's outside, he's holding us in,  he won't let us out, we're like, come on, we gotta get out of here.  He goes, if you guys leave, I'm gonna get my niggas.  And he starts screaming, where are my niggas at?  Where are my niggas at?  And we just pushed through the doors and ran into the chief's car.  We thought we were gonna get shot.  The guy's screaming at the top of his lungs.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Well, thank you, Brian.  All right.  Thank you.  We lose your mic, I think so.  How about Billy from airsick.net? 
[88:00]
 Billy?  Hey guys, what's happening?  Oh, I miss the good old wine dance.  Yeah, you used to drive through there too?  Oh yeah, remember the corner?  Which corner?  No, it was called the corner.  Oh yeah, where the stores were, they wound up getting all burnt down.  Yeah, well, they didn't burn them down, they demolished them.  Yeah, they took a bulldozer.  Dude, get this, and oh, this is the truth.  They had to destroy these stores  because so much drug dealing was going on behind the stores.  Like right in the parking lot.  So instead of like maybe taking care of the drug problem, 
[88:30]
 they destroyed the stores.  They bulldozed them down so there'd be no more place for them.  That's a lot or something.  Yeah, and that was totally renovated.  I think that's the MLK center now or something.  Yeah.  But I used to go back there.  I actually picked up a hooker back there once.  Oh yeah?  I swear to God.  That's great, must have been a real looker.  Oh, she was a real piece of ass.  I mean, who the hell cares?  How big was his penis?  Not bad. 
[89:00]
 Come on, you gotta know the rules.  The minute they get in the car, you gotta check the package.  Yeah, no, I don't know the rules.  I'm sorry.  You know the rules.  You don't even know those rules, man.  Yeah, you gotta check for the packages.  We don't need to know those rules.  We have a radio show.  Yeah, but the corner was the best, man.  You couldn't go anywhere near there.  There were shots there every night.  It was like a paradise for vices.  It's like watching a Vietnam movie. 
[89:30]
 Pretty close.  Yeah, you gotta worry about the gunfire and there's hookers and drugs.  Something for everybody.  It's like Disney.  Yeah.  Hey, Billy, your song's making a comeback in the Most Offensive Song contest.  Oh, thank God.  My peeps are coming back, huh?  It's between you guys' Killifetus and Fuel's Baby Raper.  I gotta admit though, we're still humming that stupid Barry Manilow thing in my ass. 
[90:00]
 Yeah, a catchy little ditty.  We're still looking for people to send in their entries for the Most Offensive Song contest  and then we're gonna have all the finalists perform their songs live at our next roadshow.  Sounds like fun, guys.  All right, Billy, we're gonna let you go.  You betcha. Have a good one. Peace!  There he goes, Billy from airsick.net.  Let's get these people in that were on the Today Show.  All right.  We got a ton of email about this.  Everyone knows Psycho Mark getting the wow sign on TV like crazy.  We encourage the Psycho Mark psychopaths to get their signs on live TV, right, Ed? 
[90:30]
 Yeah, absolutely.  And just when we thought the action was slowing down,  wow, there was some stuff going on on the Today Show this morning.  Yeah.  We gotta say hi to... there they all are.  Someone videotape it?  I'm gonna be able to check that out.  I might have, actually.  Well, let me introduce you guys.  We got four of Psycho Mark psychopaths in the studio.  We got Sean, Chris, Avey?  Avey.  And Shannon.  They're all from Yorktown and you guys got up real early this morning 
[91:00]
 to hang out outside the Today Show studio, right?  Yeah, we did.  Now, my girlfriend saw the We Deliver Keggers.  There it was.  That's the one she saw on the Today Show this morning.  We delivered kegs.  These guys went all out, Aunt.  What else did you guys have this morning?  We got five of both sides.  So they have like ten sayings from the radio show.  All right, let's start from my left.  We had Spaz come home.  What else do you have?  Turn it over.  And OK Terrific. 
[91:30]
 All these signs were on the Today Show this morning.  All right, let's go to the next guy.  He had Yoddle Doodle on his side.  Very good.  What's on the back?  And we delivered keggers.  Shannon, which ones did you have?  I got Show Me Put It.  The back of this one is just like the Ruse for Al Roker.  But we also got the Wow one.  Oh good, the Wow.  Very important to get the Wow on at least once.  And FBA. 
[92:00]
 FBA, come on.  Very good.  And what do you have over there?  We got the Got Sushi.  And Bumpin' Donuts.  We got a nice little drawing of two donuts bumping into each other.  That's crazy.  Everyone saw you.  You guys were all over the Today Show this morning.  That's cool.  Enemies of the show must be attacked by the psychopaths.  And just when we thought it was slowing down, these guys came to the table this morning.  So we completely appreciate it. 
[92:30]
 Are we going to hook them up with some goods?  Yeah, some stash.  If we have wrestling tickets, we'll definitely give them to you guys.  That would be awesome.  See, we give you treats.  Speaking of wrestling.  Ross is at the Metal Rance tonight, Anthony.  Spaz is going to be on hand.  And we're hoping all our listeners bring some fine signs down there.  If you guys need any signs, they have some.  We deliver peggers.  Very creative, these guys.  Cool.  The Yaddle Doodle. 
[93:00]
 None of you got caught in Al Roker's gravitational pull?  No.  Good.  That's a danger.  Now what happens?  Mike, no one heard what you just said.  We got yelled at by the NBC producers about the wow sign.  Get out of here.  I want to know if we're affiliated with a certain radio show.  What a bunch of jerk-offs.  We mostly want the wow sign on TV, but if you guys have the opportunity like you guys did this morning to be on a lot,  then definitely break out the other signs.  They were giving you crap though about that, huh? 
[93:30]
 Yeah.  That's all right, jackasses.  We haven't had anyone on the news lately.  When the reporter is doing that live shot and all of a sudden the sign goes in front of his face.  That's terribly wrong.  Those are my favorites.  Well, do you guys want to say hi to anyone or anything?  Yo, what's up Heroes Deli?  Heroes Deli, very good.  You guys all get one plug.  Who do you want to plug?  Yo, Moseman crew.  Yo, Flip Mode.  Flip Mode Squad. 
[94:00]
 You got a Flip Mode Squad?  Pick up some of my Flip Mode Squad.  We play baseball sometimes.  We have our own little team.  Last year our team was called Flip Mode.  Woo, big thing.  I don't know.  All right, and you?  Hey, can we give you some of our band's tapes?  Ah, that old bruise.  I remember that.  I'll put them in with the other ones.  Never mind. 
[94:30]
 We'll check them out.  What's the name?  Give me your tape, man.  Burn Bath.  Me and my brother used to do the same thing,  try to weasel our way in on radio shows to give them the tapes.  Yeah, you know how to give them the tapes.  I'm going to listen.  I'll listen in the truck.  And what's the name of the band?  Burn Bath.  We're playing this Saturday at Delhi College, too.  Delhi.  And what do you do for the band?  I'm a guitar player and he plays the bass.  And this guy drew the cover of the tape. 
[95:00]
 All right.  And Shannon, what are you?  Are you the sweet Connie of this band?  Oh my God.  A little obscure reference.  No, you're just friends with these guys and stuff and support them?  Yeah, I just get them for free and drink.  Jay Moore plays at the Delhi.  Favorite college of Jay Moore.  Well, we got to thank the crew from Yorktown, Anthony.  Very good.  Bravo getting the signs on live TV.  We love that. 
[95:30]
 We encourage that.  We're still waiting for a girl to flash on the Today Show.  We'll get a thousand bucks.  Yeah, actually, those guys said something about that when they were getting yelled at this morning.  Yeah, they say you guys pay money to have chicks flash on the show.  Yeah, like a hundred dollars or something.  No, no, no.  We have one contest going on.  First girl to show her naked breasts on the Today Show will win a thousand bucks.  One time, one time only.  First girl to do it, contest over.  It's got to be on camera.  And that's about it. 
[96:00]
 We've been trying to make that happen for over a year now.  It's got to be a real girl.  Real boobs.  And if you go down there and just show your cans and run away, that doesn't work.  It has to get on camera.  On TV.  Ben, you hooking them up with some stuff?  We got some wrestling tickets, hopefully?  Ah, play along.  You guys get the famous inappropriate bells.  We're not really giving them out that much.  Okay, terrific.  All right, well, we got to say thank you to you guys.  Yeah, thank you. 
[96:30]
 All right, Yorktown rocks, all right?  Cool.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll be back, more of your phone calls in just a bit.  212-757-1027.  This is the best radio you guys can come up with.  1027-WNEW.  And we're back.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  I guess we've got to acknowledge the ECW.  I guess there were a lot of wow signs on the pay-per-view last night.  George, what's going on?  Hey, Loppy and Anthony, what's up, buddy? 
[97:00]
 How are you?  We're on the ECW pay-per-view, Living Dangerously.  I saw your signs there, wow, and we deliver K-gives.  And I heard there was an okay, terrific sign there as well.  Joe from Leviton on the instant feedback saying that.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, yeah, man, you guys are awesome, Joe.  All right, man, thank you.  Take care, buddy, thanks a lot.  All right, bye.  A lot of people checking in saying there were wow signs at ECW.  Brian, you're next.  Hey, what's up? 
[97:30]
 Yeah, we're on your website, apparently.  Yeah, we got a terrific sign and the wow sign.  Yeah, what game was that at?  It was Saturday, Saturday morning.  And you're already on the unofficial website?  Yes, sir, check it out.  Nice, sir.  Well, I don't know, you had the Today Show people down on the air.  We wanted to come down and say hello.  You got some beer.  Well, we pretty much invite anyone that gets on live TV with a wow sign mostly or any other signs associated with the radio show.  And we hook you up with prizes.  Oh, man, we were on National Televised ESPN.  We got the tape to prove it, baby. 
[98:00]
 Why don't you bring the tape with you and you're more than welcome to come down.  Whenever you want.  All right, sounds good.  As long as you bring the tape so we know it's you and we'll hook you up with some prizes.  Way to God, you guys are great.  Hey, thank you.  See you soon.  Thanks for spreading the word of wow on live TV.  You know it, you guys rule.  All right, cool, bye.  Also, today, Anthony, we got to give Dan Marino a lot of credit.  Why do we got to give him a lot of credit?  Let me tell you why.  Dan Marino, if you've been living under a rock, has retired from the Miami Dolphins today. 
[98:30]
 Dan Marino?  He's retired from the Miami Dolphins today.  And he's working on TV.  Thank God.  Thank God, because there is nothing worse.  He stepped down with a little pride today, Anthony.  He didn't have to cry and lose it like that horse tooth John Elway.  Oh, Elway, actually, we have a quick sound.  This is Elway snorting when he retired.  Do we really have it?  Yeah.  No joke, right?  This is no joke. 
[99:00]
 This is really a sound he made as he was crying.  It's his snorting.  And it sounds like a horse.  Well, that was because it was in between tears.  Yeah, he's like, and, you know, being with Denver, great team for so many years,  and winning the championship,  it's just the biggest dream come true ever.  So, Marino retires today and he didn't cry.  Yeah. 
[99:30]
 He retires today, and he retires without a Super Bowl ring.  He could buy one.  He could buy one, though.  Got enough cash for that.  All those endorsements he's done over the years.  They were trying to make him look good on ESPN.  I was watching the retirement speech.  They were showing all the records he owns.  He's arguably one of the best quarterbacks ever in the NFL.  Oops, how about a championship ring?  But they're saying, you know, they're showing all the records he set in the NFL and stuff.  Yeah.  Because they were just trying to make it look good, 
[100:00]
 because the fact is he never won a Super Bowl.  But he is in ESPANTURA.  Remember that?  Remember that when they stole the Miami Dolphin Dolphin?  Yeah.  So he's got that going for him, which is nice.  Which is nice.  Para?  Yes.  Is that really your name, Para?  Yeah.  Okay, what's going on?  Actresses want to be known that way.  As what? 
[100:30]
 Actresses want to be known that way.  You're an actress?  Yes.  What have you done?  Suck Slots from Hell?  I saw that one.  No, really good stuff.  I worked in the West Village, the Theater of the Ridiculous, a gay theater.  Theater of the Ridiculous?  Come on, we're going to do a play.  Gay theater, cool.  Kind of that way, yeah.  Did you wisp as one of your co-stars?  I heard that.  It made me a little worried. 
[101:00]
 Gay theater, are you a fag hag?  No, no, no.  Actually, my boyfriend will marry me if I have a desire for lesbian for a day.  You want to be lesbian for a day?  Yeah, but see, I just don't get it.  I have a little desire to do it and I'm interested, but I don't get what turns guys on about this.  I can't explain it to myself.  It's just awesome.  Well, you need to give me a few words.  I don't know. 
[101:30]
 What, as far as girls going at it?  Yeah, what?  It is the number one fantasy for guys.  Why though?  He's willing to marry me.  Wait, Anne's got an answer.  I got a simple reason.  Why?  Because it's two girls.  We love girls.  And you see, one, it's really hot, two is twice as hot.  Two is one better than one.  I said it's a guy going in all the right places, but he said, well, I really don't know. 
[102:00]
 Do you realize how many people were listening to our show Friday when we had the lesbian bath going on outside the studio?  Do you have any idea?  Yeah.  We usually get like, I don't know, a hundred emails per show and that was three girls, which is two better.  I've already gone through a couple thousand emails from Friday's show and I'm only about halfway done.  What do they say?  It's just a huge turn on.  We had Smelly Karen, she's now known as Karen because she had her bubble bath with the two lesbians. 
[102:30]
 There were three in this kiddie pool filled to the top, tons of bubbles, soaping each other, making out, a huge lesbian scene going on.  We had it on the webcam and people just lost it.  Absolutely lost it.  Could it be as simple as that?  Just two guys seeing two girls?  I don't get it.  Yeah, because it doesn't work the other way around.  Exactly.  I don't know many girls that are into checking out two guys.  You want to know something? 
[103:00]
 I had worked at that theater and I had said, let me just see what this is.  It was the most boring thing I've ever seen in my life.  It's exactly right.  Hold on, Chuck has something to add to this lesbian thing.  Chuck?  What's up?  Well anyway, Anthony, you're serious about 100% correct now.  100% correct now.  You figure two girls and a girl, two girls is unbelievable.  If you had ten, it would be ten times better.  It never ends. 
[103:30]
 What better for a guy to walk in than a whole mob of girls going at it together and you could be the one guy.  It's a simple formula.  The more women, the better.  Exactly.  Very simple.  What beats two women?  Three women.  On forever.  It's an infinity equation.  This keeps going.  One better, one better, one better.  So, Par, you want to be a lesbian for a day?  I do.  We're definitely taking the lesbian for a day to the next level. 
[104:00]
 We started last Friday, we're starting to look for lesbian fantasies now.  The lesbian couch is still here, we'll use it, but we want to get a little more interesting, a little different.  We've already broadcasted first lesbian experiences, I don't know, at least ten to twelve of them now.  Now we want some good fantasies going on.  The bubble bath was great.  Don't you want my particulars?  No, we want to know what you want.  We're like Mr. Rourke from Fantasy Island.  I want someone to be aggressive.  Gashes everyone, gashes. 
[104:30]
 Okay, terrific.  Alright Chuck, we're going to let you go.  Alright, there he goes.  So, if you want to be a lesbian for a day, you have to...  I need an aggressor, I'm not the aggressor.  Would you agree to a strap-on tool?  In what way?  At this point we don't need girls coming down here and being shy.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, to work out, you know, kissing on the couch.  That was all cool and stuff, but just like marijuana was a stepping stone, I need some H. 
[105:00]
 It was just the beginning.  Now we need, you know, the girls to do something.  Okay.  So, like the bath was a good thing.  And now we're looking for a...  What about oil?  Oil is good.  As long as it lubricates.  Well, what if you're wearing the strap-on?  Me? No, no, no.  Alright, what if you're taking the strap-on?  Well, Rose has a question for Para.  Rose, you're up. Turn down your radio.  Hey, what's up? 
[105:30]
 First, I'd like to say that Rose is my theatrical name.  And secondly, that has to be the stupidest question in the whole world.  If she's that least fit sexual or essential person, how could you ask such a stupid question to women as beautiful?  Yeah, it is just absolutely beautiful.  I agree.  So she missed what I had said.  My fiancé would marry me.  He just wants me to do that one time.  And I'm just wondering what the curiosity is. 
[106:00]
 I understand it is beautiful.  Oh, if you're going to do it, don't do it for that reason.  You might do it and want to believe in them.  There you go.  We don't have time pussyfooting around here.  We have enough women that have fantasies that want to happen live on our show.  Wherever the foot wants to go, I really don't care.  That could be a nice lesbian fantasy.  I'm interested in oils and things like that.  Oils?  We're going to have to get a little more interesting than that.  3-in-1, WD-40. 
[106:30]
 Alright, Rose, thank you.  Take it easy.  Rose is a little rough.  We need something interesting.  I think I'm going to let you go.  You've got to come up with a specific lesbian fantasy.  And if it sounds like some we can pull off, we will have you on the show.  She said she's an actress.  Would you do a part in a movie if it was you with a strap on?  Alright, we'll do a little movie down here.  Alright, so you direct it. 
[107:00]
 I don't want to have to direct myself.  Would you do a strap on scene?  If you direct it, yes.  Okay, we'll look for a girl.  Alright, hold on the line.  I'm going to let Power go.  Let's go to Diana.  She sounds like she'll be a pain in the ass when she gets down here.  We need the ladies that are like...  Karen was a perfect lesbian candidate.  I didn't agree to this strap on.  No, I didn't.  If you listened to the call, I never said no, no, it wasn't.  We need some gamers here. 
[107:30]
 Diana, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  The reason that you guys got so many emails from the other day is because it was the hottest  thing that we actually got to watch, we weren't just hearing it.  I know.  It was incredible.  We shut down two websites Friday.  I can't believe that N.A.W. let you post all that too on their site.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  We don't have a spaz cam.  No clue what you're talking about. 
[108:00]
 What the hell does that mean?  All I can say is the webcam was supposed to...  Renew every 10 seconds, Anthony?  Yeah.  It got to the point where it was almost up to renewing every two minutes.  That's how much traffic we had Friday.  I must have had a good connection then, guys.  You had a great time watching that whole thing Friday, huh?  It was definitely hot.  Yeah, and a lot of people were pissed because they couldn't get through and stuff.  Well, there's a ton of material from Friday's show on www.foundrymusic.com, the unofficial  Opiate Anthony website. 
[108:30]
 I guess I didn't catch everything.  I guess Patrick Parr doesn't understand what's so hot about two women.  All you had to do was check out what we were doing Friday and you would understand.  The soaping of the boobs was my favorite.  And I was reminded of that because we watched a Kentucky Fried movie last night, Ant.  Oh, you were?  I thought that movie was funny.  Oh, yeah?  It's not as funny anymore.  I had Ben and Psycho Mark over and I was showing them before we went drinking in Huntington 
[109:00]
 yesterday.  They didn't laugh once.  Even Catholic high school girls in trouble.  They didn't find the humor in it.  Sometimes it's just funnier to say the stuff.  With the bumping of the boobs up against the shower door.  Sometimes it is.  It's funnier just remembering that it was funny.  Diane, I'm going to let you go, okay?  Can I just add one more thing?  One thing, I'm absolutely addicted to Sims and two, you guys have got to get syndicated.  I travel out to California once a month and I'm dying without you. 
[109:30]
 We're getting there.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Because of the effort of you guys, we're getting there.  It's just a matter of time now.  Psycho Mark, you were at my house watching a Kentucky Fried movie?  It was boring, huh?  There's only one good scene in the whole movie.  He liked the daredevil scene, Ant.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  That has got to be one of the most classic.  Thrill seekers.  Thrill seekers, right.  Do you want to explain the rest, Anthony? 
[110:00]
 He goes into a train track or something, next to some train tracks, and he goes to a bunch  of black guys that are hanging out, like black thugs and stuff.  They're all playing craps.  Yeah, they're all playing craps, shooting craps against the wall, pretty bad neighborhood.  He's a little white guy, but he's wearing a helmet and a cape and stuff, like a superhero.  He just yells, niggers, and runs away.  Runs away and they chase him.  That's his daredevil play.  That's better than jumping the fountain at Caesar's. 
[110:30]
 That's how he is a daredevil.  He should have marked you that.  Oh, yeah.  Somehow in the movie, it is a little funny because of the irony.  But I was excited to pick up the Kentucky Fried movie.  It's kind of hard to get.  I'm like, man, this just didn't hold up to the test of time.  The Catholic schoolgirls in trouble is funny, but the rest of it just blows.  What about Big Jim Slade?  That's funny.  The guy's trying to get away with his girlfriend. 
[111:00]
 A little Kung Fu movie thing going on through the whole thing.  That's really funny.  That's a really good parody of all the Kung Fu movies.  All right.  Pick a better movie, dude.  It's been a while, too.  You remember it when you were probably 18 watching it stoned off your gourd, too.  Were you stoned?  I was fried out of my head.  It wasn't even funny when I watched it when it came out years ago.  I sat there and was like, when we were in high school, that was like a cult film. 
[111:30]
 Everyone loved that one.  Maybe you just need stronger drugs.  No, I was sitting there going directly into the retina.  I was sitting there going, wow, this movie just blows now.  Wow, look at that.  There's a couple chuckles.  Let's go to Priscilla.  Priscilla, sorry.  Goddamn, what's wrong with my mouth?  Yo, Priscilla.  Priscilla, how are you?  Fine, how are you?  Good. 
[112:00]
 I heard you're having a lesbian fantasy.  Yes.  What's your lesbian fantasy?  Can we make it come true for you?  I would like to bang a girl.  Like a strap on?  You would like to bang a girl?  Yes.  Now that's what we're looking for, right, Anthony?  Of course.  All right, so now we just need a girl that needs a banging?  Yes.  How old would you be, Priscilla?  I'm a small chest but a big ass.  Small chest, big ass, and you're 95 pounds and you got a big ass? 
[112:30]
 I got nasty visual.  You're 5 foot tall, 95 pounds with a big ass, no boobs.  Something tells me with the strap on she'd look like a candy apple.  Laughter  Hmm, wow, that could be quite a scene.  So if there's any broads out there that are willing to get banged by a 5 foot 95 pound  lady with a big butt and no breasts, give us a call.  Oh my God. 
[113:00]
 I don't know if we're going to get any takers on this.  Dude, come on, that would be pretty interesting.  It would be hilarious.  Let's get your info.  Have you ever banged a girl before?  No.  Do you have those type of tools at home?  No, I would have to purchase them.  I think we could sponsor it through one of our Smut connections.  Yeah, we could find the tools, no problem.  We just need to find the girl.  Can I take the tools home?  Sure you can.  What are we going to do with them after you use them? 
[113:30]
 Priscilla Race?  Hello?  What's your race, your ethnic background?  American.  Okay, what does that mean?  If I tell you what I am, no one really knows.  What are you?  Maltese.  What the hell is that?  See?  You know the Maltese Falcon.  And a Maltese dog.  What is that?  It's a small island in between Sicily and Africa.  Are you a black girl? 
[114:00]
 No, I'm not.  I have white skin.  That's like no man's land.  You're either eating Sicilian pizza or grubs.  No, Sicilian pizza.  We're more Italian than black.  There's no black people in my country.  Alright, well that adds to this.  So if any ladies out there want to be banged by a five foot girl, 95 pounds, no boobs, big butt, that's Maltese.  Give us a call.  I can't understand why no other ladies are calling up right now.  Where are the takers?  Priscilla? 
[114:30]
 I'm willing to get banged.  I think I was correct with the first pronunciation of you now, Priscilla.  She's willing to get banged, she said.  Oh, so you would get banged as well.  Yeah, you know.  Alright, okay.  Let's hold on the line and we'll see if there's any takers.  Alright.  Okay, terrific.  If any other ladies have a lesbian fantasy, you gotta get in contact with the radio show, okay?  Alright.  One more call, we gotta take a break here.  Melanie, what's up?  Hey, what's up? 
[115:00]
 How are you?  Good, how are you guys doing?  Great.  Yeah, I have a story to tell you about a bachelorette party where I tried, my girlfriends and I tried to get the two guys to do a little show for us.  Oh, that doesn't work.  And what?  Well, the one guy was definitely into it.  Most of these strippers are getting into it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, time out.  You're having a bachelorette party and two guys show up to give you some fun, right?  Yeah, one was real hot, the other one wasn't too hot. 
[115:30]
 And then you're trying to talk the guys into doing each other?  Well, the one guy looked like he kind of opened the door.  He bent the other guy over like he was picking something.  Oh, god.  And we were of course very excited.  Okay, terrific.  We thought it would be hysterical, you know.  The other guy wasn't really into it.  That's just hilarious.  So we got into this whole conversation with the one who wasn't into it and we said, you know, why not?  We were yelling at him.  We were pretty loaded, there was like 20 girls there.  And it got to the point where we were yelling at him because he started getting dressed and he was trying to leave. 
[116:00]
 So we started yelling at him to take his clothes back off and he wound up flipping out the back door without his pants.  But you know, we got into this conversation.  He wanted, and I'm telling you, there's girls out there that would love to see it just for a laugh.  I can't imagine there's a lot of girls out there that want to see two guys going at it.  Yeah, well why not? 
[116:30]
 And there's not many guys out there that wouldn't check out two girls going at it.  Yeah, no, I know, but don't you think there should be a supply if there's a little bit of a demand?  I don't think there's a demand for that.  You know, call me crazy, but we could poll the women here and I don't think they're going to admit that they want to see that.  Well, that's the key word, admit. Nobody wants to admit it.  You really want to see two guys going at it?  I'm curious. I'm curious. I'd love to see what it's like. 
[117:00]
 I think chicks would, dude. I think like, girl, yeah, like obviously no guy is going to want to see that.  But I think girls, like as far as maybe a porno goes or something.  You think secretly there's girls out there that really want to see two guys going at it like we want to see two women going at it?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  Probably not as many as the guys wanting to see the girls, but I'm sure there are.  All right, we'll see if any ladies are willing to admit that, Anthony.  All right, Melanie, thank you.  You're welcome. Bye-bye. 
[117:30]
 Do we have to?  That's disgusting.  Couple ladies calling in. Let's take a break and we'll talk to them next, okay?  Right.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths we'll piss someone off.  We're out of control. We're so lucky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer and I've been up since like, well, I don't know, yesterday. 
[118:00]
 And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is O.B. and Anthony.  I'm talking 1027 WNEW.  Hammer, I'm going to pee.  We got to get Jim Brewer back in here, man.  That boy tracks me up every time.  All right, it's the 08 show. Yeah, you got that right.  2127571027 is our phone line.  Kind of just screwing off today. It's a Monday.  Having some fun, though. 
[118:30]
 Definitely having a good time.  Where do we go? Where do we go?  We have to talk about two guys going at it.  Oh, well, let's go to Sandra.  Sandra, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Okay, how are you guys doing?  I'm sorry.  Matt, what the hell was Ellie talking about?  I'm sorry. Women name it not the fact that they masturbate.  They do not deny the fact.  All right, Sandra, let's slow it down. 
[119:00]
 She won't stop talking, O.B.  Let's take a step backwards.  It's a conversation.  We got on the discussion where the number one fantasy of guys is seeing two girls go at it.  And then, I don't know, we got on the subject of two guys going at it  because a girl called up about a bachelorette party  and they were trying to get the two guys to go at it.  And I call me crazy, but I said that I don't think there's many ladies out there  that find that something they would want to check out.  Your thoughts, Sandra? 
[119:30]
 I definitely think that Melanie must have been wasting her mind  because there's no way that two guys going at it is something to fantasize about.  Sorry.  And I was saying that two girls obviously is much more attractive  than two guys going at it.  And women may deny the fact that they masturbate,  but they're not going to deny the fact that they want to see two men going at it.  Well, thank you, Sandra. 
[120:00]
 That was good.  Thanks, guys.  There's a couple of girls that are really into this.  We'll talk to them and then we definitely have to move on.  We'll humor you girls for just a couple minutes here.  Donna?  I disagree with that girl  because I think the fantasy that men have about two women  is nobody knows how to please a woman more than another woman.  And I think the same holds true for a man.  A man knows how to satisfy another man. 
[120:30]
 So, Donna, you're saying I watched two men have sex and you enjoyed watching?  Correct.  What was so great about it?  Well, like you said, another guy who knows what feels good on a guy,  without the benefit of a penis,  we have to take the guy's word on what actually feels good.  But another guy knows what feels good.  Well, how did you get into the situation  that you were checking out two guys going at it?  It started off me having sex with one guy. 
[121:00]
 Oh, God!  And then the three of us together.  And then I wanted to watch the two of them together.  And they said, sure, no problem?  A guy knows what a guy wants.  Pressure, moisture, movement, repeat.  So what kind of sex were the two guys having in front of you?  Oral sex.  Oh.  Yeah?  How did this happen?  We were just talking about it.  We were talking about lesbianism and we're going here? 
[121:30]
 Took it off of ten thousand.  All right, Donna.  Thank you.  We've got to take one more.  Karen, awesome to see two guys go at it?  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, guys have a fantasy about seeing two women,  so why shouldn't women have a fantasy about seeing two guys?  It doesn't seem to be a popular fantasy for you guys.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, it is for me.  Why would you want to check that out?  Why not?  I want to see another guy, please, another guy. 
[122:00]
 Orly...  Anyway.  And that would be a huge turn on to you?  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  All right, Mike from Union Beach.  Look, you guys are doing gay radio again, without Jay Moore even.  Michelle, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I'm pretty good.  You know, now that I'm thinking about it, Donna kind of grossed me out.  But all I'm saying is that we want to watch women all the time.  Why not? 
[122:30]
 If you're loaded, I'm out.  Why not put you guys up on the stage?  You also want to see two guys go at it?  Well, I mean, if I was loaded, like right now I'm pretty loaded.  I'm on spring break and kind of wasted right now.  I wouldn't mind seeing two guys kind of like screw around a little bit.  What happened to going like south for spring break?  Where are you for spring break?  Well, right now I'm in Nutley, New Jersey.  Woohoo!  Rock!  We're really tired.  Nut, Nutley.  So what do you do on spring break in Nutley, New Jersey?  I drink. 
[123:00]
 That's about it, huh?  Lots of drinking.  Sex?  A little smoking, a lot of sex.  Yeah, these girls are like out of mind.  I call you last week.  I just, I wanted to call you a couple weeks ago and tell you that I was pretty sick listening  to all these girls shave their whatever.  Yeah.  You know, you were like rubbing across and trying to listen to anything.  Oh, you mean, uh, what's in my pants?  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, what's in my pants?  You guys are really freaking sick, you know that, but.  Yeah, we like being sick. 
[123:30]
 I took a long way.  Okay, terrific.  A little too much beer.  What Michelle wanted to say is she took our advice, she shaved down to a wood floor and  it's uh, it's terrific.  I think terrific.  I recommend it highly.  Okay.  For all those girls out there.  Thank you, Michelle.  Oh, and one more thing.  Watching two guys go at it is a lot better than watching some five foot Maltese whatever.  That sounds a little sick.  Yeah, let's get back to Priscilla.  She's still on the line. 
[124:00]
 Get back to Priscilla.  She's a little lonely over there.  Alright, cool.  Later.  I'm going to get this dumb bitch off the radio before I kill myself.  Alright, let's see if there's any takers for Priscilla.  Priscilla wants to bang abroad or get banged.  Priscilla is five foot tall, 95 pounds, no boobs, big ass and she's Maltese.  Alright.  Right, Priscilla?  Hello? 
[124:30]
 That's correct, right?  Yeah, that's right.  I don't look as bad as you're making me sound.  No, no, we're making it sound bad?  We're making it sound bad.  No, it just doesn't sound good.  I just described you, five foot, 95 pounds, big butt, no boobs, Maltese.  Are all those facts true?  Yeah.  Okay, that's alright.  Let's put you on with Sarah.  Sarah?  Yes?  Priscilla is looking for someone to bang her.  That's her lesbian fantasy. 
[125:00]
 I'm piping in from the same alley.  I mean, everybody that's calling in is either drunk, AKC registered pedigree.  I don't know.  I'm not interested at all in the men, watching the men do whatever they have to do.  I'm only looking for beautiful, tall women, no fatties, no butch, no shrimp, or people  that come from representing the lollipop land or whatever.  What are you?  Sorry. 
[125:30]
 Oh, off the table.  Well, thank you, Sarah.  So I guess we don't have a love connection.  You're not into Priscilla, right?  No.  Sorry, Priscilla.  Hold on, Priscilla.  There's someone on the other line that might be interested in you.  Let's go to Liz.  Liz, you're on with Priscilla who wants to be banged.  Hi, Priscilla.  How are you doing?  Fine.  How are you, Liz?  Good. 
[126:00]
 Just a little bit more description.  What color hair do you have?  I have short dark brown hair.  Short dark brown hair?  Yeah, and brown eyes.  Brown eyes.  I wear glasses.  You wear glasses.  Have you ever been with a woman before?  Yeah, but I only kiss the girl.  You only kiss the girl, so that's not really being with a woman.  I don't think she's been with a man either.  Hey, Liz, have you?  Have I?  Liz sounds like she's experienced, like she's like... 
[126:30]
 You sound like pro-dyke.  No, no, no, I'm not a dyke, I'm bi.  Yeah, strapped it on and gone to town, have you?  No, never strapped it on.  When I'm with a woman, I like being with a woman.  Wow, I got you.  When I'm with a man, I'm with a man.  Yeah, but if Priscilla wanted to have a strap on...  I'm not really into that.  What if you put the strap on?  Myself?  Yeah.  And then you'd like to have fun with Priscilla?  No, I like being with a woman to be feminine. 
[127:00]
 I'm not...  If you had a couple of gay guys, and you were like, okay, how about you put a zucchini on your ass and then do a headstand and Bob will do a flip and land on top, they'd be like, okay, I'm bi, that's awesome, wonderful.  That's a total turnoff.  All right, well, Liz, the problem is we're trying to find someone that's going to bang Priscilla.  Yeah, no, no, I'm not into that. 
[127:30]
 She's looking for the banging.  I want to bang, but I will get banged if it's necessary.  All right.  Well, good luck, Priscilla.  Would you agree to a sheep, Priscilla?  No, I wouldn't.  Okay.  Thank you, Liz.  All right, there goes Liz.  Hold on, Priscilla.  Michelle from 10 minutes ago is very, very pissed off at us.  Michelle, what's going on?  What is up?  What's the problem?  We're calling in and calling me a dumb whatever.  Okay, I can be a little calm down now. 
[128:00]
 Okay.  Where is he?  You got it.  We're in Belville now.  Where are you?  We're in Belville now.  You're driving?  I'm not.  All right.  Geez over here.  What is going on?  I don't know.  I guess you kind of sound a little stupid and the listeners called you a dumb bitch.  What can I tell you?  Only because I'm forced to because I'm driving around with another guy who's probably on 
[128:30]
 the same level of that kid calling in.  That's because you're a dumb bitch.  I'm a dumb bitch.  Yeah, right.  Have you hobbed that guy's knob yet?  No, not quite.  Get to it.  Talking with that mouth is just a waste of time.  Okay.  I think you listen to our show a lot.  Why would you call it?  Okay, maybe it's a closet listener thing going on.  I'm totally not into you guys, but whenever I'm in the car with my buddy Mike over here  and he has you guys on. 
[129:00]
 Well, don't make fun of our listeners, okay?  Yeah, my buddy.  How's that Cabrio?  Oh, you're going to get to me with that?  I know it's a fag car.  I'm going to get a Durango or a Grand Cherokee very soon.  Then I'll look hip again.  I ain't buying no diamond rings.  See, she listens all the time.  You listen to everything we say.  No, he fills me in.  I'm too busy going to school.  You're but.  I'm too busy studying, man.  That shows. 
[129:30]
 Get in here, cause when we get in these search engines, how can people'ticed?  I like that.  Alright, Michelle, go take another bonThose checks are ahen, we've got  Alright, we got to move on with our show.  What do we a anyways, hold on, Jennifer agrees with you?  Yeah.  You're on with Michelle, the dumb bitch.  Oh hi.  What the hell is our problem?  First off, Belleville is like the biggest faggots in the world.  I'm not from Belleville, but it's all right.  You're at Nutley or whatever.  Okay, first off, you have no clue what your Hadley dollars in.  talking about so I suggest you shut up. If you're listening to them, obviously you like them too. 
[130:00]
 Are you from Bloomfield? No, I'm not.  What are you telling me? I'm a dumb bitch here driving through Belleville?  You are a dumb bitch. What are you looking at?  I'm not home actually, but I mean, listen here, you're just a stupid bitch.  Are you working now? Me? Yeah.  Why is that in your business what I'm doing? Why are you bothering me?  Who the hell are you? Who the hell am I? 
[130:30]
 Who are you? Are you anything? No.  Am I anything? I'm something and it's called a dumb bitch.  I'm a dumb bitch. I'm a dumb bitch.  Anyway, you can get off the phone now, thanks.  Dork waiting. Yeah, okay.  Alright, Jennifer, thank you. Thanks, Jeff.  Alright, hold on, there's another girl that wants to talk to you.  I want to test some more. Alright.  Another girl is coming to see us.  We're making friends, Michelle. Debbie?  Michelle!  It's 5.25 and you're drunk and you sound like an idiot. 
[131:00]
 Dad, spring break, get a life, okay? I could do whatever I want.  What are you, that you're calling into this radio station and you're talking such crap?  You've been listening all afternoon, huh?  I've been listening since I got into the car home from work. It's called work.  Oh yeah, I'm on vacation. Let's get another one.  I'm on vacation driving around Jersey drinking with my friends,  Drunken Friday, Michelle. I'm so mature.  You're a closet drinker.  I'm a closet drinker. 
[131:30]
 Alright, Michelle, alright, Michelle, go drive around with your buddy.  Go drive around with your buddy, Michelle.  You're so cool.  Oh, I'm hick now. I'm even more clever.  You're so clever, Michelle. Pass the doobie, buddy.  Give me another beer back here. I hate Opie the Anthony.  But I'm going to keep calling.  Hey, wow, let me flash him. Hold on.  Wait. 
[132:00]
 These girls are all frustrated or something. Calling in and everything.  You know?  I like that.  Opie the Anthony, I just want to tell you, the girl who's hanging on who wants to have the lesbian affair,  she should stop wasting her time and go into a reek on her and be really mean to her.  This is for Michelle. I hope she gets it for her.  Alright, thank you, Debbie.  Bye. See you later, Deb. Is she going to go for the Maltese?  Wow, there's a lot of people that just love you, Michelle. 
[132:30]
 I'm glad we made those phones light up for you.  No, it's funny. Debbie has your voice down.  Really?  Yeah, she does.  That's great.  Sounds like the pubs are more fun. I'm going to head over there.  Alright, you dumb bitch.  Alright, see you later, asshole.  Alright, bye.  There goes Michelle.  Alright, we'll dub her. Michelle, our favorite hosebag.  Priscilla, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Alright, I think we found a girl that might want to bang you.  Sabrina?  Hello?  Hi, what's up, Sabrina? 
[133:00]
 Hi.  You're on the line with Priscilla.  Hi, Priscilla.  I'm 5'7", I'm 115, and I think I'm pretty hot and I would love to bang you.  5'7", how much?  5'7", and I weigh 115.  Whoa. And what kind of body do you have with that?  Boobs, okay, natural, yes.  Brunette.  Brunette, sure.  But only one condition. My fiance has to watch.  We hate when you guys bring the dudes. It just wrecks it. 
[133:30]
 Can we videotape it and then I can have it so he can watch?  So, Sabrina, are you going to use the tool?  Oh, definitely.  Psycho Mark wants to know what size boobs you have.  It's 36C.  36C, and you're willing to give Priscilla the bang?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I mean...  So, we can... Sabrina, where are you from? 
[134:00]
 I'm from Brooklyn, New York.  Brooklyn, in the house.  Well, we'll have you girls down if you guys are really gay.  Oh, definitely.  All right, Priscilla's size doesn't bother you? 5'95"?  Nope, not at all.  Sabrina, how old are you?  27.  27. And should we allow her to bring her guy down?  Look at everyone going, no!  No.  Yeah, no, no.  What if we videotape it for you? 
[134:30]
 We could videotape it.  And we'll give you the tape as you leave?  Sure.  Okay, yeah, because it interferes with the show.  Like, if your boyfriend's in here watching, we feel silly about commenting on what you two are doing.  Yeah.  And it kind of distracts us from really letting the listeners in on what's going on.  Yeah, we have to do our jobs.  Nothing personal.  I'm sure he'll be listening anyway. He's probably listening right now.  All right. Well, if you girls are definitely into this, we'll do it ASAP.  Okay.  So we're going to put Priscilla on hold, and we're going to put Sabrina on hold, and we'll see if they're not full of ass. 
[135:00]
 Okay.  All right?  Okay.  Here they go.  Sabrina and Priscilla.  Yeah.  Priscilla wants to be banged. Sabrina is willing to bang Priscilla.  Cool.  And Priscilla just hung up.  That dumb bitch.  You sure you didn't hang up on her?  I swear to God, I did not hang up on her.  Priscilla, call back.  Yeah.  She hung up, but Sabrina's still on hold.  So get Sabrina's info.  Maybe it scared her, Anthony.  I don't know. She seemed into it, and she held on for quite a while. 
[135:30]
 All right. We're taking the I want to be a lesbian thing to the next stage.  We are looking for the lesbian fantasies now.  We got bored with the lesbian couch.  After that bubble bath thing on Friday, we got to bring this to the next level.  Oh, yeah.  All right. We got to take a break, Ant.  Okay.  And we'll be back. Stay.  Hold on. I don't want to play that.  Stay there.  Train Crackle Reef.  Yeah.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  It's got a water bottle. 
[136:00]
 Colby and Anthony, 1027 on WNEW.  Ah, the unmistakable sound of corn.  Yeah.  Wee, wee.  Corn coming to town April 1st, Continental Arena.  April 8th, Nassau Coliseum.  I hope we have some tickets to give away to those shows.  Corn, one of the best live acts out there right now, man.  Remember when they used to play like small little shows for the last station we...  Yeah. 
[136:30]
 Anthony and now they're like the biggest rock band in America as you speak.  We don't like these listener parties and stuff with a couple of thousand people at most.  And there's Corn playing.  We hung out with all those guys a lot.  Yeah.  Now they're huge rock stars.  Yes, they are.  And you can't get your hands on them.  You can't get them to show up here, that's for sure.  We must have interviewed them three or four times.  The odds of us getting them in the studio now, slim to none.  Yeah. 
[137:00]
 But we still like the guys.  I don't understand why that happens with these bands though.  Ah, they get people and then they start telling them what to do like Godsmack, you know, Sully.  Sully, good friend of... not just like professionally,  personally, good friend of ours when we were up in Massachusetts.  And when we first moved back home to New York, he was calling the show a lot, but now...  Then all of a sudden K-Rock says, hey, go over there and talk to them and...  We're not going to play a record, we're going to make your life a living hell.  And next thing you know, our pal doesn't know us anymore. 
[137:30]
 Yeah, great, thanks.  Thank you.  I haven't seen a lot of these bands.  No band that is still cool to us no matter how big they get, Green Day.  Yeah.  They're rock stars.  Rock stars.  Rock stars.

Which one do you want to be?  They finally get to meet.  Woohoo! 
[147:00]
 Dressed in his John Travolta suit, I hear after that they headed off to the Verrazano  Bridge where they danced and one of his friends fell off to his death.  That's amazing.  Then they banged some fat bitch in the back seat of the car.  Then beat up some Puerto Ricans.  It was a real fun night for the mayor.  John, what's going on?  What's up?  Did you guys see that clip on the news?  Singing a lot.  It was the funniest goddamn thing.  Oh my God.  It was Giuliani in drag and Donald Trump jumping on top of him.  Who the hell is running your city?  Why is Giuliani constantly dressing in drag? 
[147:30]
 He likes it.  Because it obviously has a fag sperm or something.  Look at this fat, clear son.  I want somebody to put on a strap on and do me.  Do me.  Hillary, get on the strap on.  Yeah, she could do that.  She probably got the package herself.  Alright everybody, let's have anal.  Yeah.  I didn't get to see the footage.  Anthony says it's hilarious.  It is so funny.  He's just up on stage doing the dance.  Doesn't he feel like a buffoon? 
[148:00]
 Doing that?  I mean, my God.  He's running New York City.  And he's doing the Saturday Night Fever dance.  And going for a Senate run and dressing up in drag.  You know what he should have done?  Walked up to Hillary and just squeezed her fun bags right for the cameras.  Imagine that shot.  Imagine that photo op.  Who would you vote for?  If you see Giuliani squeezing like her cans.  I would have to vote for Rudy, sure.  Vote for Rudy.  Oh yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Can't wait for that race to heat up, man.  Yeah, they won't be shaking each other's hands after the mud starts slinging. 
[148:30]
 Mud, it's going to be crap.  Hey look, I'm tuning in Tokyo.  Hey Hillary, nice fun bag.  Okay John, thank you.  Alright guys, thank you a lot.  Pull out his Schwantz.  When was the last time you saw one of these, you geek?  She could do the same, though.  Let's go to Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi Jennifer.  Hi guys, I love your show.  We just moved from California and our friends told us to listen to it in Long Beach.  California.  Hey, what part?  Long Beach.  Long Beach.  The home of the Queen Mary.  Yes, that's where I live. 
[149:00]
 Of course.  And the Spruce Goose.  Yes, huh, yes.  Oh, I know everything.  I went to school out there for a while.  That's where I met Dreamweaver.  No, Dana Hills High School.  Oh wow.  Yeah, and Dana Point, you know where that is?  Yes, I do.  And look, go to Beach.  Oh, that's beautiful.  Yes.  Are you a hot California babe?  I don't have blonde hair.  With the blonde hair?  No, I don't have blonde hair.  Blue eyes?  No?  I don't have blue eyes. 
[149:30]
 You got the silicone boobs?  No, I don't think they're real though.  You got tan and everything?  Tan, yep.  Yeah, you got a nice bod?  I think so.  Why did you move to New York?  Because I wanted to.  I got sent to California.  California.  Yeah.  How long have you been in New York?  Four months.  Have you been robbed yet?  What?  Three, four.  How old are you?  Twenty-three.  And you just decided to move by yourself or are you with anybody?  No, me and my roommate.  We wanted to come on your show.  Roommate?  Okay, describe your roommate.  Roommate, roommate.  Come on.  She's cute, she's cute.  All right.  New York City. 
[150:00]
 Yeah.  And what would you and your lovely roommate like to do on our show?  Anything you want.  Are you two like lover roommates?  Yeah.  And what would you and your lovely roommate like to do on our show?  Anything you want.  Are you two like lover roommates?  Not yet, but we want to do that for you on your show.  Oh.  We want to do a lesbian for the day.  Is she also from Cali and everything?  Yes, we both are.  She's blonde hair?  Yes.  Blue eyes?  Yes.  Now what kind of lesbian for a day fantasy would you like to do?  I'll tell you my fantasy.  We'll do three's company.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  Only not the homo version.  What did you say, Jennifer?  What?  What would you like to do?  Something with whipped cream. 
[150:30]
 Come and do my fantasy.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  I'll be Jack Tripper.  What would you like to do?  Something with whipped cream.  Come and do my back door.  We'll be waiting for you.  You could be the warm up act before persiligets are banging on Wednesday.  Okay.  Would you like to come in with your roommate with a bunch of whipped cream and stuff?  Sure.  Other food products possibly?  I don't know.  Nothing to an FC.  Would you like to be part of the blue tarp cabaret?  What's that?  Oh, something we haven't broke out here in New York yet, but you could be the first. 
[151:00]
 Okay.  Do you want to explain the blue tarp cabaret to the fine ladies?  Oh, it's a very simple concept.  We spread out a big blue tarp and then we, around the edges of the blue tarp, we put  various food products and you girls get in the middle and decide which food products  you want to squeeze all over each other and then you just kind of roll around it and make  a big mess.  Okay.  No meat or fish though.  Then we watch you shower.  What did you say?  Nothing like meat or fish. 
[151:30]
 No meat or fish.  No, it's like fun stuff like chocolate syrup.  Chocolate syrup and whipped cream and cherries.  Cherries.  You could even pick out the food products you'd like.  Okay, that's fair.  What would you like?  The whipped cream.  Whipped cream and cherries.  We love chocolate.  Cherries.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  What else?  California.  How about a banana?  I don't talk that bad.  How about a banana?  Bananas?  Sure, why not?  I don't want one in there.  Very nice.  Like a lesbian sundae. 
[152:00]
 Sure.  All right.  Maybe a little ice cream?  Okay.  Ice cream.  That's going to melt.  Have you had pizza here in New York?  No, we haven't had pizza yet.  Let me tell you something.  California pizza blows monkey ass.  You've got to have New York pizza.  It's the best.  Whenever you're from New York and you go to California and you get pizza, it's such a  mistake.  This stuff is horrendous.  It's a sponge with sauce on it.  Really?  Yeah.  Now get some New York pizza.  You'll like that.  Okay.  You guys know you're famous in California too?  Why?  Why?  Because you're famous in California.  Why?  Because you're famous in California.  Why?  Because you're famous in California.  Why? 
[152:30]
 Because you're famous in California.  I don't know.  I heard all about this wow stuff so I had to come here and listen to it.  Wow is huge.  Wow is very popular.  It's all over the country now.  It is, huh?  All right, Jennifer, we're going to make a human sundae with you, with your hot roommate.  Okay.  Describe yourselves.  Me?  Yeah.  Okay, I'm 5'4".  I have long brown hair, blue eyes.  I have big boobs and a big butt.  Not too big.  How big?  How much do you weigh, Jennifer?  130.  I don't have cellulite or anything. 
[153:00]
 All right.  You're a little solid.  That's okay.  How big are your boobs?  30'60".  All right, that's not bad.  That kind of compensates.  That's all right.  Now describe your roommate.  Okay, she's bigger than me.  She's like, let's see, about 2'0".  No, 12'.  She's like 5'6".  Okay.  Maybe she has like short blond hair, big blue eyes.  She has really big boobs.  All right, and what about?  I think hers are thick.  I never really asked her that.  What about the caboose?  Oh, it's fine.  It's cute.  All right, and you're both willing to roll around kind of naked in the blue tarp with 
[153:30]
 some food products?  Yes, we are.  Uh-huh.  All right, and can you come in Wednesday?  Wednesday?  Sure.  Wednesday, all right.  Very nice.  Yeah?  You'll be the warm-up act before Priscilla gets her banging.  From the great state of California.  Okay, can we watch that?  Huh?  Can we watch?  Of course.  As long as you guys put on a good show, yes.  If you put on a crappy show, we kick you out the door before the banging.  No, we'll be doing anything else you have to tell us.  All right, now I'm sure you girls will do just fine.  We'll put you in your guidance.  Okay, we're done in Monica.  All right, hold on.  Rick's going to set you up for Wednesday.  Okay. 
[154:00]
 We'll pencil you in.  We'd like a doctor's office.  We'll pencil you in for 3.30 Wednesday.  We'll make an appointment.  All right, hold on, Jennifer.  Okay.  That's cute.  A couple of young girls from California, brand new here in New York.  How long do they find their hacked up bodies in a 55 gallon drum?  Oh, come on, man.  Down in Jersey, in the swamps.  Yeah, that's cute.  For our last week before vacation, we got to, you know, Erica's Most Wanted, we need  your help to find these two girls. 
[154:30]
 We have to have a nice lesbian fantasy before we go away for a week.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Pete real fast.  Pete, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  Yo, what's up, man?  Yo, listen, I saw Tom Brokenshaw on Rosie today.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, jeez.  I've been watching the whole thing.  All I could hear is, uh, this is Tom Brokenshaw.  Tom Brokenshaw, I'm just going to add that he was here with Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, he was so pathetic.  Rosie O'Donnell, the star of the Getting the Mammoth Out of the Ice show on the Discovery 
[155:00]
 Channel.  She's huge.  Tom Brokenshaw, NBC Nightly News, sitting next to big fat Rosie O'Donnell.  It could be bigger than the Apelio Loro.  She certainly displaces more water.  Wonderful.  She was playing the part of the Wooly Mammoth on the Discovery Channel as they dug her out  of the ice and put a blow dryer on her fur.  Amazing.  Rosie O'Donnell, star of the Wooly Mammoth show on the Discovery Channel. 
[155:30]
 Tom, you sound very drowsy today.  A little.  Long weekend, a little tired today on this Monday?  Yes, I was hanging out with Opie and his friends in Huntington drinking at meetings.  I got quite the bag on as we jumped in his gay cabriolet and started whisking through  Huntington drinking and driving.  It was wonderful.  I'm a little needed. 
[156:00]
 A little tired today.  Just a little.  I love that psycho mind.  Why doesn't he hold up a sign behind me, Tom Brokenshaw?  I'm just behind.  All right, Tom, it sounds like you had fun at Rosie's this morning.  Tom?  Tom?  Tom?  Mommy, I don't want to go to school today.  Hello?  Tom Brokenshaw, NBC Nightly News.  Tom?  Yes?  Maybe if I start his music he'll wake up.  Okay, perfect.  Wonderful.  I was sitting next to Rosie O'Donnell and got caught in her gravitational wave.  I was sitting next to Rosie O'Donnell and got caught in her gravitational wave. 
[156:30]
 I was sitting next to Rosie O'Donnell and got caught in her gravitational pull.  It was amazing.  She has so much math.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I saw Tom Brokenshaw when he was coming out of the Rosie taping or whatever.  Yeah.  And I was like, yo, yo, what do you think of Opie and Anthony?  First he didn't even look at me or anything. 
[157:00]
 And then I was just like, yeah, Opie and Anthony, ONA, ONA.  And he was just like, uh, I don't know.  I haven't heard of them.  Yeah, good.  Right.  It was just he was so obviously full of it, you know?  Good.  I hope he doesn't hear about us.  Yeah, we don't want him hearing about us.  I know, not bad.  Why not, man?  A special expose on Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you should put him in a Bukaki film.  All right, Jack.  Later.  Thank you.  It's Jack Mihoff on the phone.  Let's go to Lewis. 
[157:30]
 Lewis!  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  How are you, Lewis?  Good.  I need your help, boys.  What's the matter?  My wife's sort of made an appointment for me to get a vasectomy, and I've got to get out of it.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you serious?  Yep.  You know you have that deep manly voice, right?  This is what you're going to sound like after the operation.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah. 
[158:00]
 So why does she want you to get the vasectomy?  Well, we have a two-year-old right now.  Yeah.  He was born with a little bit of a problem, like a genetic problem, nothing like something  internal with his intestines.  And they're saying if we have other kids, it could possibly happen, right?  Yeah.  So what kind of like, if you had a bad pregnancy and all that whole junk, so we really, you  know, I don't want to have her go through that pain again, you know what I'm saying?  What's wrong with the pill?  She can't take the pill, man.  Oh, yeah.  We call the chemicals there, you know what I'm saying?  Chemicals. 
[158:30]
 Chemicals.  So you're willing to get the tubes?  Oh, I'm not willing.  I'm not willing at all.  So why don't you just tell her I'm a little, you know, unsure about this?  Because then it will cease and desist, you know what I'm saying?  Excuse me, Lewis.  If I may offer a suggestion, Mike Tyson here, Dr. Tyson, I practice OBGYN.  What's that spell?  OBGYN. 
[159:00]
 I think that's spells.  I don't know what it spells, but Lewis, I got an answer for you.  You don't want the vasectomy, but your wife don't want no more children?  Yes, Mike.  Okay, here's what you do.  Call Dr. Mike.  I'll come over to the house, we'll make an appointment, and I will slam her so hard in  her uterus, the kid you have now will feel it.  Okay?  Okay?  Or you could try slam your girl in the uterus home kick that we're putting out now. 
[159:30]
 It's a Mike Tyson instructional thing on how to punch your girl in the uterus.  That's real funny, you sick bastard.  Hey!  Hey!  So what are you trying to do, man?  You're trying to make an appointment Saturday and you go to this guy on Saturday to go sit  and have a confirmation with him?  All right, Lewis, this is what we're going to do for you.  The guys are calling like crazy and they want to give you advice.  No, I'm serious.  So if you could hold on, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to get the guys 
[160:00]
 giving you advice next, okay?  All right, hold on.  All right, are you on a car phone?  That's what I'm talking about.  It's going to be like a four-minute break and then we're going to get some good advice for you.  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm serious.  A bunch of guys saying do it, don't do it, you know.  They've been married for 29 years, you know.  All right, let me take a quick break and we'll get to the bottom of this next, all right?  All right, I'll hold.  If you have advice for Lewis, we'll take that next.  Stay there.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway. 
[160:30]
 You're going to have to tune yourself in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Anthony, we have Lewis on the line.  Yeah.  Lewis, you're there, right?  Yeah, I'm here.  Okay, we're going to get some advice for you.  Lewis's wife wants him to get a vasectomy, Anthony.  Wow.  So let's get some advice.  Oh, the pain, the pain of a door. 
[161:00]
 Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  No one's touching my testicles.  I need the viridium.  John, you got some advice for Lewis?  Yeah.  Hey, ass.  Why don't you wear a condom?  Oh, dear.  John, how old are you?  I am, yeah, but...  John, dear boy, how old are you?  Fifteen, and I got...  Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!  Would you like to bunk with Dr. Zachary Smith?  You've heard of lost in space. 
[161:30]
 How about lost in anus?  That's great.  So, John, you're fifteen, and you suggest that Lewis wears a condom.  Yeah, what an idiot.  John, wait till you get a little older.  Dear boy, yes, what an idiot.  Things get a little different when you get older, John.  Condom, and he doesn't even have to worry about the hair getting rolled up in his...  He's only worried about his hands right now.  Wait till he gets another couple years old.  He'll be all right.  Yeah, I need a little bit more of my hand there, buddy.  Wow, fifteen-year-old John trying to create barbs with his legs. 
[162:00]
 He's a spunky one, isn't he?  Just like dear William.  Hey, John, Lewis is going to get his nuts clipped there.  Have fun.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  No, that doesn't work there with the VX.  Okay.  Yeah, thanks, old.  Hold on, let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're on with Lewis.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Go ahead and do it.  It's no problem.  It's no big deal.  Oh, yeah?  I had it done like five years ago.  You're wearing a laser now, right?  Sex is still great. 
[162:30]
 No problem whatsoever.  Wait, Lewis, what's the question you have for Jim?  No, I was told that it's done with a laser, that they put like a little pin-size hole in  and it's an out-pain operation.  Yeah, it's done in the...  Basically, most of the guys who are any good at it can do it right in their office,  local anesthetics, and it's done.  Oh.  Yeah, great.  All right.  They can chop them off in their office, too.  What does that mean?  You know?  Let's go to Mike, get more advice here. 
[163:00]
 Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got two things for this guy.  A, either she gets her tubes tied or B, this is the way I do things.  This is the way you got to do.  Just agree with her, right?  Make her think that you don't want to do anything else more than this vasectomy.  Make the phone call.  I'm very excited.  The minute she feels like you're really down with it and you want to do it,  she'll forget about it because once there's not an argument,  women don't really give a... You know what I'm saying?  Oh, no.  So just agree with her. 
[163:30]
 Be like, yeah, I can't wait.  I'm really excited.  Then once you go and do it, she'll be like, oh, you know, we don't have to do this  because when it's not an argument, they don't really care.  Yeah, but guys, she's going to be there, going to me to consultations.  She's going to be going with me when I'm going to the surgery.  I'm on vacation in three weeks, man.  She has it all planned out already.  I'm going to be getting it done when I'm on vacation.  Louis, she's symbolically castrating you, dude.  Yeah, Louis, you might as well give her all the junk so she can keep it in her purse  and give it back to you when she wants to use it. 
[164:00]
 Just put a snap on the back or velcro.  They won't tie up tubes, man.  She's too young because they definitely won't do that, you know?  They're really, for some reason, ethical about doing it to women,  but could give a crap less about us.  Yeah, but are you sure it's you and not her?  Maybe she's the one with the gimmick problem, you know?  How old is she?  She's 25.  25?  That's not old enough for tubes tied.  That's not too old for tubes tied.  Nah, they won't do it, man.  Of course they will, especially if you have a kid already.  And how old are you, Louis?  I'm 29.  29. 
[164:30]
 All right.  I'm going, a doctor or a priest?  Let me try to get some...  Actually, act like that priest, man.  He's a doctor, a neurologist.  All right, let's go to Fred.  Fred, what do you have for Louis who's thinking of getting a vasectomy?  Louis, you.  Yo, Louis.  Yeah?  Don't do it.  I had one done about, what's this, about four years ago.  I'm telling you something, dude, that's like a major invasion of the most private area you could ever imagine.  I'm telling you, it's not pleasant. 
[165:00]
 Probably the hardest part of the whole thing was, first of all, having these gorgeous nurses look over the doctor's shoulder while you're there, totally exposed, shaved.  And just, I mean, it's like the most humiliating thing.  But then the doctor starts jamming needles right in the old sack of...  Oh my God.  Come on.  I'm telling you, I had six needles in the old sack.  And about half through, I started feeling something.  The doctor goes, oh, oh, what? 
[165:30]
 You're not supposed to be feeling anything.  I'm like, well, tell my nuts that.  It was not pleasant.  And then, of course, you're completely inoperable for several weeks afterwards.  And I would tell you that, you know, ultimately, you definitely lose something in the sensation.  It's just that sex is not the same as it was before.  I don't care.  Anybody wants to tell you, the doctor was there telling me, oh, yeah, yeah, I did my own in my own office. 
[166:00]
 He did his own.  I swear to God, that's what the guy told me.  He did his own vasectomy.  That's great.  He goes, I don't know any urologist who haven't done their own.  Meanwhile, he's trying to sell me on the $600 operation.  Dude, it's not like you're working on your Buick.  Jesus Christ, the guy's doing his own vasectomy?  I swear to God.  I would love to see a video of that, man.  Oh, okay.  I zip a hair up in the zipper and I'm screaming.  Never mind taking a scalpel to the side of my sack. 
[166:30]
 They told me that I'm going to be in there five minutes and I'll be right back to work.  I can actually have it done in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon if I really wanted to.  Oh, great.  Yeah, and I don't think O.J. was at the scene for more than five minutes either.  Look at the mess he made.  I don't think five minutes really matters much.  You've got to be some kind of masochist to think you're going to be that.  She's symbolically castrating you.  She is taking it as far as it is legally possible to castrate you. 
[167:00]
 Anthony, you're right.  You're right. You're absolutely right.  And I tell you that my sex life is about down to next to zero now.  Oddly enough, a couple of years later, it's like, you know, I'm telling you, dude,  don't do it.  All right, Fred. Thank you.  All right.  More advice for Lewis here.  Hold on.  Lewis, hold on one second, okay?  Yeah, I got it.  I say he tells her...  All right. Sorry. 
[167:30]
 Oh, you heard that?  Yeah, you can't say it out of me there.  I'm sorry.  Adam from Glen Cove on the Instant Feedback.  Advice for Lewis.  Advice for Lewis.  Instead of a condom or a vasectomy, a nice herpes canker makes a good sex preventative.  Happy virus hunting.  Nice.  And this just in.  Yeah.  This just in to the O&A studio.  Yeah.  Chuck from the Bronx.  Gorilla with wow sign on Channel 2. 
[168:00]
 No way!  No way!  Someone taking the wow experience to the next level.  And then Devin from Patterson confirming it on the Instant Feedback.  Damn you, Adam!  Someone dressed as a gorilla with a wow sign jumping around like a monkey,  screaming, okay, terrific on Channel 2 live shot.  That's why I was laughing during the vasectomy discussion, because Ben handed this to me. 
[168:30]
 Okay, terrific.  The gorilla has a wow sign.  He's jumping around like a monkey, screaming, okay, terrific on Channel 2 live.  We went to Channel 2, and I guess it happened a few minutes ago,  because nothing's going on there now.  We want that guy here in the studio.  That guy should come to the studio now.  Chris from Jersey, turn on Channel 2 for monkey with a wow sign.  Gorilla on Channel 2 with a wow sign.  Oh my God!  That's killer, man. 
[169:00]
 Instant Feedback exploding.  Monkey on Channel 2 with wow screaming, okay, terrific.  That could be the best one yet.  I've got to see this.  God damn, someone better tape that.  I've got to see that.  Everyone's flipping to Channel 2.  I think it's over.  I think it happened about five or ten minutes ago.  I don't think you get a second chance at that one.  No.  People getting creative with the wow now, Anthony.  I'm going to jump around saying okay, terrific. 
[169:30]
 Oh, man.  Let's go back to Lewis.  Damn dirty end.  Ruined my live shot.  Damn you.  Let's get some more advice for Lewis.  I had to break in with that little bit of news.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Listen, I have four kids.  My wife wanted me to go do it.  Next door neighbor had it done.  He couldn't walk for three days.  Couldn't walk.  That's great.  Lewis. 
[170:00]
 Yeah.  You play baseball?  I actually do, yeah.  All right.  You ever get grazed?  Just grazed in the nuts?  Just grazed.  Now I hear great.  Now, can you imagine them doing that to you?  No.  You send your wife in.  You send your wife in.  You get the oil lube job.  They dock.  Do the oil lube job on the wife and that's it.  No way.  No way.  No way.  Nobody touches the scrotum area, boys.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  You guys.  What, Dan?  Dan?  All right.  We lost him. 
[170:30]
 You know what happened over the weekend?  Me and the girlfriend are playing like Nerf football in one of the drug stores near the  house, just kind of screwing around in a little toy section.  The thing took a bad hop, hit me in the right nut.  That's the worst.  Direct impact.  And like, you know how the pain doesn't set right in?  No.  It's a deep hit.  I don't even know where that pain comes from.  You know it's coming.  You're just waiting for it.  After you get hit in the nut, it's like you're just waiting for the pain. 
[171:00]
 You know it's coming.  So it's like, okay, it's not here yet.  So I get in position.  I'm down, like on my knees, hunched over, waiting.  All of a sudden, that nauseating lower abdominal dull pain kicks in.  It comes from deep within.  It hurts so bad.  And that's just a Nerf football hitting you in the sack.  Yeah, now let's break out the frigging cutlery.  That is that, though.  And this just in.  I swear, Brian, you're a sick F. 
[171:30]
 Brian from Hackensack on the instant feedback.  Hey, guys, I just saw Patrick Ewing with a wow sign on Channel 2.  I did not write that.  Look, I'll even crumple up the paper.  It was printed up.  All right, let's go to Jimmy, who's a surgeon.  Jimmy.  Yeah, hi, guys.  How are you?  Good, thanks.  Listen, I want to tell this guy that he's crazy.  Not only is he so young not to do this,  but the surgery has a million side effects, including infection.  But forget about that.  A lot of people lose their sensation when they have this done. 
[172:00]
 So sex will never be the same after he does this.  And he's way too young.  What if he dumps this woman and wants to get married and have kids with another lady?  Yeah, we already discussed that.  And the reason being, some guy that we know, he had a reverse surgery,  a reverse mastectomy, and his wife is having a baby like any day or something.  But he was in more pain getting the guy named Reverse  than I could even imagine ever wanting to be in with this.  Let me tell you, the Reverse 30% of the time does not work. 
[172:30]
 So, I mean, this is a permanent procedure as far as you're concerned.  You're crazy for wanting to do this.  All right, and Jimmy, you're a surgeon?  Yeah, I'm a surgeon than a man.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  More emails coming in.  Joe from New York.  OJ with a wow sign on Channel 2.  Was that a monkey? Okay, terrific.  Bob from Hempstead.  Funniest thing I've ever seen on Channel 2,  a gorilla jumping around screaming,  okay, terrific, with a huge wow sign.  Harry Ape on Channel 2. 
[173:00]
 Who is that guy?  Get down to the studio before 7.  We want to talk to you, man.  I got to see this guy in complete gorilla regalia.  Yeah, you got to show up with the gorilla outfit on.  Holy smoke.  All right, well, Louis, I don't know what to tell you.  A few people are saying no big deal, have it done,  not as bad as everyone's saying.  Well, let us know if you go through with it, okay?  Yeah, well, I have to go Saturday for a consultation.  All right. 
[173:30]
 And then it's going to get done in two weeks, so.  All right, good luck to you, man.  All right, guys.  Definitely call back.  We want to know how it plays out.  All right, no problem.  All right, there goes Louis.  Getting a vasectomy very, very soon, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mary.  Mary, what's going on?  You're next on WNAW.  Hey, I want to sing my offensive song.  You want to sing your offensive song?  You want to be in the most offensive song contest?  Hey, what's the prize, anyway?  We don't really know yet.  We'll come up with something pretty cool though.  We really don't know.  We're trying to come up with something, yeah,  like Anja said, something cool.  Okay, cool.  It's like a grab bag prize. 
[174:00]
 If you win, you can grab my bag.  All right, let's go to the next question.  All right, let's hear your most offensive song.  Okay, it's called Eat My Period.  Wait, all right, all right, hold on.  I don't even know if you can say that on the air.  All it means, Opie, is she writes a sentence on a piece of paper, right?  Yeah.  And then at the end of a sentence, everybody that's been to school  knows that you draw a period, right?  Yeah.  Well, you tear that period off of the paper at the end of the sentence,  and you eat it.  Okay. 
[174:30]
 It's eating her period.  Okay.  That's all there is to it.  That's the name of your song.  Mm-hmm.  You've got to record it and get it in here.  It's about grammar.  Well, let's, you want to...  I don't have a band or anything, you know?  You want to sing it right now for us?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Acapella.  Okay.  All right.  Ready?  Someone count how many times we are dumped out here.  Okay.  But it's a grammar thing.  Sure.  I think it's bad, so...  Punctuation.  All right, well, let's hear your song, Eat My Period.  Okay.  Okay.  Great.  Big problem.  I think John, the dumb guy, is hemorrhaging as we speak. 
[175:00]
 Yeah.  His head just exploded.  I heard his head explode.  All right.  We dumped out a few times.  Yeah.  I heard his head explode from here.  Four times.  Four times.  And it's still going.  Yeah.  Well, Mary, we liked the song.  You might have to get it on tape and send it in so we can bleep it out so we can get  it on the radio.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  It might be a hit, though.  Eat My Period.  Okay.  Thank you, Mary.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[175:30]
 Okay.  John's dumb finger is bleeding right now.  Now let's explain the rules of the most offensive song contest.  Yes.  It's got to be very offensive, but it's got to be able to be played on the radio.  Yeah.  That's the key here, gang.  Like, you can't just have the F song or the C song.  You've got to get creative enough where it's something we can play on the radio.  Right.  We went through some entries today.  Nothing worth playing on the radio today, by the way.  Encouraging.  Yeah.  I am just laughing my ass off, man. 
[176:00]
 Is that true?  Someone just said on NBC, someone was holding a big wow sign and running behind the camera  screaming syndication now.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, my God.  Holy S.  Iron Mike on the news holding a wow sign yelling, okay, terrific. 
[176:30]
 He's climbing the side of the building in New York.  Oh, very good.  Skate Monkey from the Bronx Zoo on Channel 2.  You guys are out of your minds.  See if the monkey can hang a picture.  Maybe it could take Black Girl's job.  Oh, wow.  I think Channel 2 is desperate for ratings.  They just put LT with a wow sign.  Come on, people.  Ted from Whitestone.  Ha ha, big hairy gorilla. 
[177:00]
 Or was it really Warner Wolf?  Okay, terrific.  That Al Sharpton will do anything for friends.  Come on, man.  You guys are out of your mind, man.  Oh, I guess no one heard the song, Anthony.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's happening?  Not one word made it over, dude.  Not one.  They're like, okay, go ahead, sing.  Nothing.  Did the title of the song make it on the radio?  Yeah, that made it on the radio, but then you were like, all right, go ahead, let's 
[177:30]
 hear it.  And then I hear Anthony talking about the dumb guy's head just exploded.  That was it.  There was nothing.  Well, you know, we love hating John, but I think in this case he did the right thing.  It was that bad, huh?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, her song was Eat My Period.  Look at John also saying, I didn't hear anything.  The entire song was nothing.  Yeah, everyone is saying that.  I didn't hear one word, nothing, Zippo.  Well, if she sends it in, then we could kind of clean it up, meaning put some beeps in  there.  Absolutely, got to hear it.  Where you hear the beeps and you know exactly what word is being, you know, beeped out,  then you guys could share in the fun like, hey.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, we got to take a break here.  Another channel for confirmation.  Yeah, we got to take a break here.  We got to take a break here.  We got to take a break here.  We got to take a break here.

I haven't seen the tape. 
[179:00]
 We need a tape of the guy dressed as a gorilla jumping up and down live on Channel 2 with  a wow sign saying, OK, terrific.  We need a tape of the guy dressed as a gorilla jumping up and down live on Channel 2 with  a wow sign saying, OK, terrific.  I tell you something.  I tell you something.  OK, terrific.  I tell you something.  If we get that tape, we're going to need resuscitation equipment in the studio.  A gorilla yelling, OK, terrific.  Feedback just exploded.  People are like, they can't breathe.  They're laughing so freaking hard.  They're saying it's the funniest thing they've ever seen.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, and Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.

You're going to see the bunt, the awning over the intimate area.  You got to burn that off with Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  You know, over 40 million Americans are too big, Opie.  You know, they're big fat people.  Where do you read that?  40 million.  How the hell did you know that?  I keep these stats in my head with the voices that tell me to.  You can't back people up in the head with space.  You can't figure out who to pick for the final four, but you know that stat? 
[180:00]
 40 million.  40 million.  Not 40 million people.  OK.  Stacker 2.  Yeah, so you got to burn off the weight.  Stacker 2 does that, world's strongest fat burner.

 My pals, Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  Ah yes, Louis.  Thank you, Louis.  Louis did a great job down there at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey over  the weekend.  Had a lot of fun.  Want to thank Vinnie and the gang for treating us all nice down there.  Funny man.  Louis cracked them up big time.  Cold chamber.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[181:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they're playing tomorrow night, right?  Cold chamber playing Roseland tomorrow night with typo?  Typo negative?  I don't know.  I'm just waiting for no doubt.  I see that.  I see that.  Ben had to come in here and tell you that he's still working on your tickets for no  doubt, Anthony.  Yeah, in front of everybody.  He always does it in front of everybody.  And he also very loudly, hey Anthony, I'm still working on your no doubt tickets. 
[182:00]
 And then he goes, and oh, I'm trying to get those corn tickets for you.  I'm like, thank you very much, Ben.  You can say that loud any time you like.  Anthony, no doubt, OP, corn.  You've seen corn though, they do rock.  Hell yeah.  All right.  A lot of people calling in early about what did we learn.  But first let's go down to the metal lands.  The metal lands.  And talk to Chris.  Ross Warriors down at the metal lands tonight, right?  Hey, what's up, Chris?  How are you? 
[182:30]
 How are you?  Yo, there's so many FBA baby raper signs here.  It's beautiful.  Baby rapers?  The baby rapers signs?  The baby rapers sign that is, we deliver kegs, it's beautiful already.  If there's a baby raper sign on Ross War tonight, I'm going to pee myself.  I'm sitting by the ramp.  I got my baby raper sign ready to go.  Baby rapers.  Now what you guys got to do, you got to do the famous Monday Night Football stunt.  You know, Monday Night Football, this goes back to when Howard Cassell was huge.  Howard Cassell.  And they go on the stands and they show a sign, I forgot exactly. 
[183:00]
 Look at that monkey run.  Remember that one?  Yeah, they had a sign that said ABC is number one or something like that.  Monday Night Football is number one.  And the camera guy focuses right in on the sign.  As soon as they knew they were on TV, they flipped the sign really fast and it said something  like Howard Cassell sucks or something like that.  That's what you got to do with those signs because there's no way they're going to put  them on TV.  No.  Oh, we're getting on TV, ONA. 
[183:30]
 Don't you worry about it.  Nice.  I'll be watching at home.  All right.  Hey, I'm coming down on Wednesday.  Can I come see you guys?  We're going to the city on Wednesday.  Ah, on the air officially we've got to say no because it's getting a little crazy around  here.  It's getting insane.  Every day there's visitors.  And we can't let everyone in every day because then you guys go away pissed off and stuff.  All right.  So if we get in, you guys...  He is calling for an appointment though unlike a lot of people that just drop in.  All right. 
[184:00]
 We'll pencil you in Wednesday.  Wednesday.  All right.  All right, ONA.  In case you're now.  Have fun down there, okay?  All right.  See you.  Look for Spaz and Psycho Mark and a couple of the other guys from the show.  They'll be down there too, party.  Where are they going to be?  Where are they going to be?  They don't mind you guys running into them.  Do you know where they're going to be, Ben?  Oh, they're going to be way up top.  Spaz is down on the floor with the guys.  He's down on the floor with a huge banner.  Be sure to say hi.  He usually has this big flag that says wow.  I love it.  All right. 
[184:30]
 All right.  See you later, ONA.  All right, man.  Opie, unconfirmed reports that New York won.  The channel was just hit by a psychopath.  We're having a good day.  It started at the Today Show this morning.  Okay, terrific.  A gorilla jumping up and down on channel two about a half hour ago.  A gorilla.  With a wow sign, yelling, okay, terrific.  Unconfirmed reports NBC was hit and now New York won it.  We've had multiple reports of NBC.  So that's just about a confirmation.  Okay.  But yeah, New York won now. 
[185:00]
 We're getting reports in that they have been hit by psychomarch psychopaths.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Well, a lot of people jumping in early about what did we learn.  So I guess we could start that and see where we end up here.  I think it's been a very educational show.  I don't know what the hell we did today.  I had fun.  Tom, what's up?  Yo.  How are you?  Everybody here.  What's up?  All right, man.  That guy Lewis, he should get the vasectomy.  Lewis should get the vasectomy, the guy they called 20 minutes ago. 
[185:30]
 Yeah.  Okay.  We've got enough retarded kids running around.  His one is plenty.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  All right, thank you.  Peace.  Bye.  Our buddy Joe Ciprano checking in with what he learned on instant feedback.  What did I learn today?  Screw the Sims.  The hot video game of the moment is Wall Street.  Syndication eventually.  That's pretty good.  Ira from Washington Heights.  I learned today never to eat dinner during the six o'clock news because when some nut  in a gorilla suit with a wow sign shows up, I'm going to be laughing so hard I'm going  to blow chunks.  Okay. 
[186:00]
 Terrific.  Matt from Orange County, New York.  What I learned today, hearing you guys talk about fags shivers me member.  All right.  There was just a goofy looking.  Yeah.  Oh, look at this.  Since it was a goofy looking guy on Fox holding up a sign saying quit picking on me, I'm getting  a Dodge Durango in a week.  I don't think that happened.  I'm going to try to get something.  Something to let's go to Ed.  Ed, what's going on? 
[186:30]
 What's up?  How are you?  I'm at the 95.  I'm telling them out there they suck on an A.  Where are you?  Sky and Twitter, but your fag is throwing A. I'm at the 95 right now.  I'm taking in the balloon.  I'm taking in the balloon.  Sky and Tyler are on A.  Oh, they're harassing the PLJ van.  All right.  At the MED.  That's always welcome.  We like that.  We like battles.  Enemies of the station.  Enemies of the show.  You guys are the best.  We like that.  We like that.  We'd have a van.  We'd have a van. 
[187:00]
 We'd have a van down there, but I don't think it would make it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm looking at the very nuts.  It says Sky and Tyler are gay in the morning.  Sky and Tyler are taking in the balloon now in the morning.  You're harassing their van driver?  Yeah, I'm harassing the hell out of them, man.  Poor guy makes four bucks an hour.  He's probably listening to us in the van.  O and A.  All right.  O and A, you guys are the best.  Hey, thanks.  Have fun down there.  All right, masturbation now.  All right.  Bye.  There goes that.  Masturbation now.  I was going to go tonight too, man.  I should have went.  Sounds like it's going to be a party tonight.  I'm going to go tonight.  I'm going to go tonight.  I'm going to go tonight. 
[187:30]
 I'm going to go tonight.  I'm going to go tonight.  I'm going to go tonight.  Bye.  There goes that.  Masturbation now.  I was going to go tonight too, man.  I should have went.  Sounds like it's going to be a party.  You going to Psycho Mark?  Oh, yeah.  I'm totally going.  Everyone wants to know where you're going to be.  They want to run into you.  We're going to take down the N.E.W. van there.  Oh, we are going to bring that piece of crap.  We're going to crash it right into the BLP.  We have the worst radio van.  The worst.  It's not that bad.  It does donuts.  It's horrible.  All right, so you're going to show up at the van?  You guys got to leave, man. 
[188:00]
 People are already there.  It's all right.  We'll be there in a minute.  All right.  Is this true?  Oh, because I don't know much about basketball, especially college ball, so I don't even know  what the schedule is.  Is it possible that Hofstra already lost their first round game?  No.  Okay.  Tournament starts Thursday at noon.  Good, because some guy is driving me here.  Thursday at noon.  Colin, you are an idiot.  Let's make sure everyone registers for the Final Four tournament.  If you're a big college basketball fan, or if you're not, and you just want to try to 
[188:30]
 for the Final Four, that's pretty freaking cool.  You just go to www.com and register who you think is going to be in the Final Four, and  then we're going to pick a winner for the trip.  Very simple, easy contest.  Just go to www.com for all the info and how to register.  Okay?  That guy just jinxed it.  Now I'm going to win.  Win it all.  We got to thank Mountain Dew for giving us this trip to give away.  Very, very cool of those guys.  The official soft drink of the NCAA.  Right.  Sick bastard, Mark.  Well, let's go to the phones and play What Do We Learn. 
[189:00]
 Yo, Andrea.  If these phones don't get f'ing fixed, if I have to hear that inane tapping one more  day.  For the faithful listeners, every time you hear this, it's because the phones are crapping  out and no one is getting the hint.  No one can figure out what is wrong with the phones.  Day after day, we're hitting these mics.  You know what it's turning into?  I swear to you, and this is the God's Honest Truth with me, it's turning into a Chinese  water torture.  Like we go to the phones and I'm just waiting for it. 
[189:30]
 You know what it is?  That's how the torture works.  Like the drips of water hit your forehead and they just sit there going, oh, look around  there, look, he going crazy.  Chinese water torture.  And the water would drip, whip, whip, whip on your head.  And the thing that drives you crazy is the anticipation of the next drop hitting your  head.  And I swear, the anticipation of the next tap is freaking me out.  And we figured out this is the only way to get rid of it because what you're hearing  what we're hearing in our heads.  Chinese water torture.  Look around, I go crazy.  You sign, say you imperialistic pig, criminal of China. 
[190:00]
 It's the only way we can fix the phones though.  I know.  And the noise we're hearing in the headphones, we have to do it really quick because it's  really, really annoying.  You think the tapping is annoying on your speaker in the car.  It's worse in our ears.  Who's on the line?  Andre?  What's up, Andre?  Not much, what's going on?  I guess we're playing a quick round of what do we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  You know what's funny?  Last time I called up I said that I learned that line three sucks. 
[190:30]
 I guess it's still...  Well this is line 11 so now the problem is spreading out all over the place.  Great.  Yeah, I learned that Opie gets real, real jittery when you guys are talking about wine  dance.  Yeah, because every night, I mean that was the shortcut home from BAB and I did straight  path and it was scary, man.  Oh, you jumped when Anthony hit the gunshot.  Yeah.  I heard you jumped.  Yeah, that came out of nowhere.  What the hell was that?  That was great.  All right, cool.  In the case you know, guys.  Thank you.  Here's an obscure what I learned today from George in Jersey. 
[191:00]
 I learned that Jay Moore is now doing bachelor parties.  That's good, I like that one.  Rod, what's up?  We do love when you guys get obscure with these.  Rod, keeps it interesting.  Hey, dude, how are you doing?  Good.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that first of all the best way to listen to ONA is on hold.  Secondly...  Oh, you heard that?  I heard that, dude.  It was great.  What did you hear?  I heard eat my period in its entirety.  No one else did.  The second thing I learned is that I'll never watch a two-hour TLC special. 
[191:30]
 And the third thing I learned is I hope they can clone the mammoth only for one...  That was the Discovery Channel.  I'm sorry, Discovery, so that the mammoth will not only trample but gore the guy, that  frog with his tusks.  The French guy, yeah.  You watched that piece of crap last night, too.  I got to tell you, I stayed for the whole two hours.  Because you were convinced it was going to get better, right?  I was so disappointed.  By the end they get this monster helicopter to come in and lift a block of ice out of 
[192:00]
 the tundra there or whatever.  The only thing that would have made the show is if the helicopter shuttered and crashed.  That's what I was hoping for.  I got to tell you...  You see the blades on that thing?  The motors were bending a little bit.  I don't ever want to watch a guy blow dry mammoth tubes again.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  That was a little lame.  You know something, does this planet really need a mammoth now if they want to clone it  and get it back?  Is there a reason they were extinct?  Maybe there's not enough room anymore for the wooly mammoth.  Oh, I also learned one more thing.  Ants just a girl. 
[192:30]
 That could be pretty wild that they could bring back some of these extinct species.  That's what we need.  Huge frigate.  We can't keep the animals that we have on this planet already from extinction.  some that have already been extinct through natural causes.  The mammoth just...it's time on this planet ran out and there was a reason for it.  I don't think we should bring it back.  You know, what are they going to do?  Put them in some zoos?  They can't have it roaming the earth like it used to. 
[193:00]
 Please, what's next?  The brontosaurus.  Yeah, we need brontosaurus.  Just because I did crap on my car from crows are bad enough.  I'm going to go out and all the bronco just crapped on my car.  Where's my snow shovel?  Hey, Frank.  Hey, guys. How you doing?  Good. What did you learn on the show today?  Well, I learned that on the weekend, Anthony likes to go to the movies and then he takes  it in the rear from strange Russian men.  Well, no, the Russian man was close to his rear.  No, my ear.  I said close to your ear. 
[193:30]
 My ear.  That's what I said.  Ear.  He was talking on his cell phone.  Close to my ear.  Close to your ear.  I think you're on all fours in the balcony, Ian.  All right.  Oh, you got me.  Bye, guys.  We haven't said that in a while.  E.J. Jiga from Westchester.  Oh, and I learned that who needs Cancun when you could go to Nutley, New Jersey for spring  break?  Steve from Union, New Jersey.  I learned to always leave enough room to make a U-turn when stopped at a train crossing 
[194:00]
 that happens to be in a dark neighborhood.  Oh, my goodness.  Ed from Jersey.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Can't censor our show, can we?  I learned that Nigger Charlie is still alive and he's on the news with the wow sign.  Oh, come on.  I still need the frame for my poster, the legend of Nigger Charlie.  Let's go to Anthony.  See?  Anthony, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I learned today that there's a place called Maltese in this world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was going to do the Nutley thing, but that guy got me already with that one. 
[194:30]
 Now, Maltese is an island between Italy and Africa.  I think it's Malta.  Right, right.  Maltese, right.  It is Malta, right?  The island is Malta and the people are Maltese.  Oh, OK, beautiful.  But we asked her where Maltese was from and she said it was an island between.  That's what the Puerto Ricans drink, the Goya drink, Maltese.  Maltagoya.  Syndication out, 10-4, regular Diamond Dust.  All right, fine.  10-4 to you.  Can't leave our show without hearing that just once.  Scott, you're next on WNAW.  Hey, guys. 
[195:00]
 Hey.  Yeah, I learned that if the word vasectomene comes out of my wife's mouth, I should punch  her in the uterus.  How old are you, Scott?  Eleven.  You don't remember?  I was just called about the sex ed question.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We asked you to ask your sex ed teacher if the vagina has teeth, which made it with a  real big hit in health class.  And then everyone had to send the JPEG of the vagina with the false teeth.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  I got that picture 100 times.  Thank you.  OK.  Thank you, Scott.  See you guys.  All right, Jason from Bloomfield.  I learned that we should forget syndication now and start fix the phones now. 
[195:30]
 Yeah, let's start with fixing the phones before we try to syndicate this mess of a radio show  somewhere else, right?  I learned that when you don't have the money to pay Anthony, make a bet with him over something  he knows nothing about.  Who said that?  That's Charlie from Jersey.  Give him credit.  Good job.  I'm thinking if I get all four of my teams in the final four, $100 per team that gets  into the final four, you have to pay me, then I'll only owe you 200 bucks. 
[196:00]
 200 for the cruise.  I'm not like you where I'm day trading making all this cash.  Oh yeah, you're the slow and steady guy.  Slow and steady.  You've made a hell of a lot of money even though you haven't sold one stock since you've gotten  into the market two years ago.  When it comes to paying my friends back, I'm slow and steady.  Slow and steady.  I'm still waiting, maybe when he sells.  I'm running out of excuses too, man.  I've tried everything, but I'm going to have to.  Obie's got stock in the first telephone company ever made. 
[196:30]
 Shut up.  It's not that bad.  I only started investing like a year ago.  You should have sold that god damn biotech stock you have.  I know.  When it went up to 24, it was up there, now it's down a few.  You know what it is?  You were a big, all hot shot with your broker.  He called up and said, Obie, I recommend you sell this.  Obie said no.  The next day it went up like five points and the broker calls Obie back and goes, good  call. 
[197:00]
 Good thing you didn't sell it.  Right.  You should have said, okay, well, sell it now.  Yeah, because now the broker's right.  Ten points down from its high.  And now it's lower than the point where the broker said to sell it.  Right.  Got greedy, Ant.  You did.  Can't get greedy.  Can't get greedy.  Playing the market.  You're never going to buy on the absolute low and sell on the absolute high.  All right.  Well, we've got to get out of here.  Got to micro next.  We had fun today.  I don't know if we really did anything.  It seems to me people learned a lot, so we've done our part. 
[197:30]
 All right.  In a more educated New York.  And if the gorilla is listening.  We need that gorilla.  If the guy that was in the gorilla outfit with the wow sign, jumping up and down.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Saying, okay, terrific.  Live on channel two.  We want you on the show tomorrow.  And someone's got to send us a tape immediately.  We got to see it for ourselves.  Yeah, I got to see that.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow too.  Thank you very much for listening to the Obie and Anthony show.  All right.  Bye.  Obie. 
[198:00]
 Keep your hands away from your pants.  Ah, too late.  And Anthony.  Anthony.  I'm just a plain fat.  More stupidity on the way.  One of two seventy.  W-A-W.
