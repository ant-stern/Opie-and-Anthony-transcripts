 OP and Anthony.  Well you guys are fucking stupid. You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  OP and Anthony.  You know, I just like wanna throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNAW.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ugh!  Fuck!  Is this the OP and Anthony show?  On this fine, fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday? 
[00:30]
 Well, I tried to nice out.  Kinda gray. Kinda spring-like though.  Well, it was kinda nice out when I, uh,  I got a...  Mother has changed, I guess, a bit.  Uh, did a little music break there. Smashing pumpkins.  A track off their latest CD, Machina, The Machines of God.  That's the everlasting gaze.  Foo Fighters, before that, Everlong.  Is he still got the, uh, is he still sporting the Uncle Fester look?  Uh, yes he is. Billy Corrigan, sure.  The CD rocks, Anthony. 
[01:00]
 Yeah.  I jam it on, uh, the Long Island Railroad  so I don't have to listen to all the, uh, Housewives.  Yapping and talking about, uh, what Broadway show  they're coming into the city to sing.  Oh.  Oh.  Best present I got, uh, present I got this Christmas was a CD Walkman.  Yeah.  I could tune everyone out. I could tune Cell Phone Guy out.  I could tune these, uh, these old Housewives that come in for the Broadway shows.  Yes, I'm seeing Jacqueline Hyde. 
[01:30]
 Right.  I'm gonna stop at the Hard Rocker.  Look at Elvis' clothes.  No, it's usually like the Carnegie Deli or, you know.  Yeah.  They got it all figured out.  Lunch and a Broadway show.  Great.  Keep it to yourself.  I'm going to work.  Wonderful. It was fabulous.  Singing was fabulous.  I don't know what's in the water on, on Long Island, but man,  there is no hope for us.  Have you seen the show? It's wonderful. 
[02:00]
 Did you hear? Katz is closing.  You know, I never respected the show, but since it's closing, I'm gonna have to catch it.  Ha ha ha ha.  Just for the fact that it's been there so long.  I mean...  And I do, do so enjoy Broadway, the theater,  that I have to...  Get me another pommel salad, please.  Anthony, are you officially gay if your, like, wife of 30 years starts sounding like that? 
[02:30]
 I mean, these women on the tram, like, there's nothing feminine about them anymore.  They turn into men.  Are you officially gay if your wife turns into one of those?  I think it's all the sumps out on Long Island.  God damn, what's in the water?  The sump.  The hell's in the water?  Hello.  Right. That's exactly how they started this morning.  Where do you want to eat lunch?  Do you have a light, darling?  Ha ha ha ha.  Only got the fake hair that's been sprayed and all the lacquered, friggin' Ronald McDonald orange hair. 
[03:00]
 Who asks for that color?  Ronald McDonald orange, please. Just the way I get it every week, darling.  I'm going to the parlor this month.  The parlor?  The parlor. I'm going to the parlor.  They got that friggin' football helmet hairdo.  Man, it's like an Orange Julius color.  They say it all the time, but time is just a bitch.  I'm sure they were hot Bettys in the day.  Oh my God. 
[03:30]
 And now they're just like, they look like Ronald McDonald, they talk like men.  They got chin hair now.  The picture of running out of class during school to maybe meet up with her boyfriend.  They're a little hobbing of the nothing.  No, but you know, just hooking up.  Sure.  You know, you're on a little dangerous, cute and stuff.  And then just add a little time.  Why were you late from work today? 
[04:00]
 You know, you know it's garbage day and now you have to get back out and take the garbage out.  It's like, what happened? What happened?  You know, I don't think my wife's been born yet.  Is that how you're headed?  Oh yeah, that's how I'm going to solve this problem.  She's not born yet.  My wife's not born yet.  Oh, crap.  That's pretty good.  Because the more and more I listen to these Long Island Bettys on the train, I'm like, oh my God. 
[04:30]
 At least like I'll be 80 by the time they hit that stage and it won't matter anymore.  You come home to that.  No, you know, we're still happy.  It's wonderful.  You know, it's 30 years of marriage and could you shoot me?  Yes, sorry.  There was four of them in front of me this morning and I'm jamming the Smashing Pumpkins in my... 
[05:00]
 This is what's so freaking funny about the Long Island Railroad because I don't care anymore.  We will never be apart.  Right, right. So I'm cranking out the new Smashing Pumpkins.  I got the CD. I've had it for about a week, right?  Yeah.  I am just checking out the latest issue of Penthouse. I don't even care anymore.  I used to hide it. I used to have a Sports Illustrated on top and have the Sports Illustrated cover up and Gash on the inside.  I used to look like that centerfold, darling.  I don't even care. So I'm bopping my head. I got the Penthouse up high and they're in front of me. 
[05:30]
 I could care less what they're thinking because I can't hear them anyway because I was cranking up the tunes.  You know, where you open up to one of the photo shoots where the girls are whizzing on each other.  That would be a good one.  What is... Oh my God.  Oh my God, the Ronald McDonald art.  That's classic.  And it is. I remember my grandmother, God rest her soul, she would go to the parlor. 
[06:00]
 Every... I mean it would only be once a month.  And you know she ain't washing her hair because it has to...  It was like the big ass head creatures on Star Trek.  Remember the first one, the menagerie, the pilot, the Captain Christopher Pike?  She had the big ass head made of just this white hair.  And she'd spray it. She'd use just wonderful hairspray.  Those big cans. 
[06:30]
 Like God forbid she went to turn the light on and it arced or something, the walls would blow out.  It would just... because of huge fire.  But she's there, you're...  I gotta just spray until I get to the parlor.  Come give your nana a kiss.  Nana, I need a gas mask to get over there.  There's some hydrofluorocarbons all in the room.  Oh, well... 
[07:00]
 And we used to, as kids, we would touch our hair.  We'd be like, hey, can I touch your hair?  She'd be like, sure, touch my hair.  And you'd touch it and you'd be amazed because it wasn't hair.  It was not hair. It was a space age polymer.  It was like hard cotton candy.  Yeah, exactly.  Like cotton candy or like fiberglass.  You know, it's all lacquered over. 
[07:30]
 Dan from Long Island on the InstaFeedback.  Hey, Howard Stern Imitators, who shall remain nameless?  Why won't Hollywood Howie mention you guys?  Obviously, he doesn't want to.  Some apparent reason.  He could mention everybody else's name when he has a problem with them.  I've heard him back down from mentioning Imus or DiBella or Man Cow  or any one of the other numbers of radio personalities that are on the air  that he said sucked and have no talent and everything else.  But he mentions them for some weird reason. 
[08:00]
 Our names are not mentioned.  Everyone knows who the hell he's talking about.  We're flattered.  That means we're not in the same category as the true imitators of your show.  No, I guess he mentioned the other people's names  because he figured people would tune over, listen and go, oh, he's right.  They do suck and then come back to him.  But for some reason, he won't mention our names.  Interesting.  Who?  Give me a sea breeze, Rob.  KJ from Queens.  He was blatantly dissing you guys today and didn't even have the balls to mention your names. 
[08:30]
 That's good.  Well, thank you, Mr. Imus. We appreciate that.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's it.  How you doing?  It's 2.53 on The Fan.  This is Howard Stern.  Looking a little familiar, isn't it?  Watch your own movie, man. 
[09:00]
 Get out of here. I don't care.  Let's go to the phone.  F you.  See what people are saying today.  2127571027. Jeff, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on today?  Yo, man, I heard, oh, Howard this morning was dissing you.  Yeah. And we were told...  He wasn't saying your name or nothing. He was just saying the two boys.  And we were told we're not allowed to talk about him, you know, throwing a tantrum and crying like a little baby.  No, because we all got to be team players.  And kicking us out of his little press conference.  There you go.  We delayed his press conference 20 to 30 minutes because he had to get us out of the room. 
[09:30]
 Yeah.  We got another thing for you.  What were you afraid of, Howard? We were just sitting there to check it out.  The company told us to be team players, so we went down to check it out. That's it.  He thought we had this big, huge plan that we were going to, like, try to disrupt his press conference.  No, that...  He went over you guys quick.  It's been done.  Well, that's fine. You know, I don't know what he was scared about. I don't know why he had to cry like a baby to our boss.  We weren't going to do anything.  I think you boys are getting set up and going for going to California, though. 
[10:00]
 Well, whatever.  Thank you, Jeff.  You're glad.  And then in the paper he takes a jab at any W, you know, calling us all imitators of his show.  Yeah.  He's the biggest ripoff artist there is, his brand new Son of the Beach TV show.  I think I've seen that done a couple times, Howie.  Police squad.  Police squad, airplane movies.  Are you going to acknowledge that?  I'm ripping them off.  He doesn't say he's ripping off the Zucker brothers and Abrams from the airplane movies and police squad. 
[10:30]
 That show is an embarrassment, too. Don't even listen to what you read. That thing will never make it.  FX should be ashamed they picked it up. Every other station, every other TV company in America said no to that thing, including our own company, CBS.  And we're supposed to be team players, not talk about it or anything.  But we weren't. We didn't yesterday. We weren't going to today.  But if he gets on the air and starts talking, I don't want to hear no names are mentioned because, God damn it, you know who the hell he's talking about. 
[11:00]
 So what are we supposed to sit here like a couple of pussies? You know, I'm tired of it.  The funny thing is the company thinks we're not team players.  I invented television.  So we figured, what the hell, let's break the ice. We'll go to his press conference. We were invited as a radio station.  Yeah, we have the proper credentials and everything. We went down there.  We're like, OK, the company doesn't think we're team players. Howard's doing a press conference. I want to check it out. 
[11:30]
 So we sat in the back row. We didn't even make a scene.  No, we weren't going to sit up front and try to make a big scene. We were in back. Like where you're at a camera range or anything.  If you want to start a scene, don't you think we'd sit up front where the cameras were or something?  No, we just wanted to sit there. You know, excuse me, Howard is a celebrity, you know, in New York City and the country.  He's a celebrity. It's newsworthy. We're down there checking it out. Not for long. 
[12:00]
 No.  Wasn't long before Mr. Security, man.  Escort us out.  Made us look like two complete idiots.  I invented the press conference, Rod.  You guys should have saw the looks we got when we were getting escorted out.  That was just scum.  Like we were the scourge of society and we weren't even going to do anything. We just want to show our support.  And the guy that made a career out of sending people to press conferences, laughing his ass off as Stuttering John goes into press conferences and just disrupts the whole thing. 
[12:30]
 And he would just laugh. And if anybody else threw Stuttering John out, how would it say?  Oh, those pussies can't take it. Don't want to face me? Don't want to face John? Don't want to face...  Oh, you'd throw him out. Yeah, what's the matter? You can't take it, you pussy?  We were just sitting there to watch. He got right on the phone and had us thrown out. Thrown out.  I invented a pussy, Rod. 
[13:00]
 The lunch sucked anyway.  Half a dry roast beef sandwich. Jesus Christ.  Thrown out like the trash that we are.  Made us feel good. As we attempted to be team players yesterday.  Didn't work. Little support.  You know, sitting down there, we were talking to the girl from Fox News.  You know, looking at Penny Cron's face fall.  You know, we were just having a little fun. 
[13:30]
 That's all. Wanted to just hang out.  You know what the funniest part of the whole thing is?  They escort Opi and I out of the building. Out of the Plaza Hotel.  They wouldn't even allow us to leave on our own. They had to make sure we were going to be out.  And inside, unbeknownst to them, seated is Psycho Mark, who didn't get thrown out because they didn't know who he was.  But the most dangerous man in media history, Psycho Mark, was sitting there the entire press conference. 
[14:00]
 With RPD right over his shoulder, making sure he didn't say anything.  That's the funny part about that whole thing. Because they were probably all relieved.  Like, oh, thank God. Thank God those guys are out of here.  They were going to cause a scene.  Everyone can calm down now. The trouble is gone.  There it is. Psycho Mark in the middle of the pack of reporters.  I think at one point though, Psycho Mark did stand up and go, Hey, Imus. Hey, Imus.  That was after we were thrown out. 
[14:30]
 We just wanted to hang. Team players. Little support for Howie and his little TV show and everything.  Because he's going to need all the support he could get for that piece of crap.  And what kind of thanks do we get? What kind of thanks?  What audience would he think would watch a show like that?  Maybe basically men. Men 18 to 49.  18 to 49? Who's the number one show on afternoon drive for men? 18 to 49.  That would be Mike and the Mad Dog. 
[15:00]
 Absolutely. Mike and the Mad Dog.  No, we're beating that.  I don't want that out there.  I think if everybody wasn't so goddamn paranoid, that sure, we might even watch it, talk about it.  And maybe bring some more people to his little TV show.  But, F it.  He didn't want us there.  We couldn't sit there. We couldn't even sit to watch the trailer. They threw us out before. They even rolled the trailer. 
[15:30]
 Didn't want us there. He was paranoid we were in the audience.  I'm quite flattered by that.  I'm sure if Scott and Todd were there, he wouldn't have made a huge mistake.  Throwing them out.  Of course not.  Anyone else? Imus.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  Gotta thank you Howard for letting me stay. I saw you throw out Hope and Anthony, those two lowlives.  I like the show. Nothing better than watching a little tight gash in a bikini. 
[16:00]
 So that's what happened yesterday. That's it. You're right.  We weren't going to say anything, but I mean we can't sit back like idiots while one side gets to lambast us.  It's just the way it is.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Alright, I was talking about the Smashing Pumpkin CD. Can we give away a few of these?  Because we definitely got to move on here.  LNA talking out their ass. No we're not.  Alright. 
[16:30]
 We just talk the truth.  Talking out our ass. Isn't that funny? You just say what happens, yet we're talking out our ass.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Alright.  I called you guys before. You guys love my voice.  Yeah, of course.  I know. You trust us all the time.  Without just being an idiot puppet, explain your point.  Alright, here's my point. Please, I won't curse, so don't. I've called you guys in the past. You know that.  Yes.  I listen to you a lot. I work and I listen to you guys all day.  Okay.  I listen to Howard my whole life.  Yes.  You guys 100% steal bits. I'm not talking about borrow bits. I'm talking about you taking exact incidents that he has done, bits he's done. 
[17:00]
 Like?  I can name a million of them. Do you want a couple?  Give us a couple of examples of how we've done exactly what Howard has done.  Okay. You guys had a guy in there one time and you had another guy eat a Twinkie out of his ass, I'll say if that's allowed, like the jackie eating the marshmallows out of another guy's ass.  That never happened.  No, I'm telling you, I heard it on your show. 
[17:30]
 Who ate a Twinkie out of his ass?  You guys had two freaks come in and the one guy had to eat marshmallows out of the Twinkie.  That's not true.  It is true. I heard it.  I'll tell you what happened. We had a big fat girl come in and sit on a cake and a guy had to eat cake off her ass for tickets. Now if you want to in some convoluted way try to make it like that's exactly what Howard did, then Howard invented breathing and walking too?  No, that's... 
[18:00]
 You guys...  You're being a little vague.  I'm not being vague. You guys are telling me that you don't see any resemblance to your show to his show.  A resemblance? Sure.  How about like an identical twin resembles his brother?  Hey Bob, I could bring up stuff that he flat out took from us.  Name one.  Alright.  That's not true.  Remember the time Howard and the crew were wearing the pens until someone leaked?  Yeah.  Aunt and I did that bit in Boston three days before he did and we had all our listeners pound his fax machine yelling and screaming. 
[18:30]
 I know. You guys listen to him probably as much as I do.  I'm just saying it works both ways.  True.  You probably did.  But no, Anthony, I still hear you mention every show he does every day.  Now...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Bob, please now listen to me for a second.  I will listen to you.  If you want to say that, I am not up until he's off the air.  I get up probably 9.30, I go right to the computer and start trading stocks. 
[19:00]
 Anthony, yesterday you mentioned stuff he said on his show.  Like what?  And I know you said it again today with the sea breeze.  Yesterday you mentioned him talking about California.  Now you're not hearing the show if somebody's giving you a transcript of the show?  No, I'm hearing from other people around the station that go,  what a fag, he's drinking sea breezes.  Sure.  I hear that, but no, I don't...  Bob, trust me when I tell you, I've known Anthony for a long time. 
[19:30]
 It's not possible for Anthony to get up there.  I'm not up. I'm not up to listen.  Please understand. It's not that you're not going to convince me.  Do people feed us a line or two around here that they might have heard him say?  Sure, of course. I'm not going to lie.  But I haven't listened to his show in a very long time.  I checked him out right after he announced the whole separation thing.  And I went on the air and said it was some of the best radio he's done since like...  And I remember you saying that. 
[20:00]
 Since like 88.  But I remember you saying that and saying that he needed higher ratings.  I remember you saying that.  Needed higher ratings?  No, you said it like this guy needs anything else to talk about.  He had such high ratings now his ratings are even higher.  You're complimenting him.  I've complimented Howard enough and we're sick and tired of hearing Howard cry about us.  No one else can do radio in New York except Howard.  That's not true. But I'm saying it's like singing, I want to hold your hand and say you wrote it. 
[20:30]
 You guys do exactly what he does.  It's not a fact.  I listen to you. I listen to you all the time.  Bob, you're delusional.  I'm not delusional. I've listened to him my whole life.  Exactly. And that's why you think like that.  Listen, I thought you were getting divorced because you got divorced.  Yeah, that's what it is.  I needed.  I'm really taking it a little far.  To tell you the truth, when he announced that he was being separated and no one knew before that,  I'm like, Jesus Christ, at that point I'd been out of my house for about two months.  So you were copying you? 
[21:00]
 Yeah, right. No, the fact of the matter is I didn't say anything and when he announced it I'm like, great.  Now if I do announce it, people are going to say, oh yeah.  I invented the voice, Robin.  Do you remember you got on and you were saying how Man Cow is stealing your stuff?  That's what Howard always said.  But Man Cow did. He stole Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  So what, just because something really happens we can't talk about it?  It killed the...  It defended me exactly the way he said it.  Bob, I'm going to hang up on you if you don't allow me to have a conversation with you. 
[21:30]
 I'm listening to you.  First of all, you're delusional if you think Howard was the first to do this type of radio.  He has all you guys brainwashed thinking that he invented all this stuff.  This crap has been going on a lot longer than Howard.  I used to drive in 83, 84 when he first came around.  I listened to radio morning, noon and night, and I drove for 10 hours a day.  There were guys doing lesbian stuff before Howard.  I promised you I was a fan of the radio. That's why I listen to you guys. 
[22:00]
 There were guys doing lesbian radio before Howard.  I know that's hard for you to swallow, but it's true.  If you want to do some research, look up Steve Cullen.  It's not that important to me.  It's just that it's very evident that you guys are doing exactly what he does.  You should have all the facts though.  You guys used to make fun of him with the lesbians, and now you have lesbians in there every day.  I never made fun of that.  You definitely didn't. I heard it with my own ears. I'm not hearing it second hand.  With this guy's logic though, it's like saying,  Oh my God, look, one baseball player is ripping off another one because he goes out there and hits home runs. 
[22:30]
 But what I'm saying is one baseball player is copying another player's style when he crunches down like Joe Morgan.  That's what I'm saying. You're taking an exact style. Exact. No difference.  That's not true. That's your opinion, huh?  You're going to tell me that...  You know, Bob, I don't even have to defend our show.  All I know is there's enough people out there that listen to us and know what the deal is,  that we do come up with a ton of original stuff. End of conversation.  I don't hear it. I don't hear it.  I don't hear it because you're one of the Howard guys and that's fine. 
[23:00]
 That's not true. I laugh a lot at things.  I hope our listeners defend us as much as you defend Howard.  I appreciate that, but it's not true. It's not true.  They cite stuff. I've been hearing Howard do it. They cite stuff and I say, Howard did this.  Howard's made a career, years and years, of getting people to believe everything he says.  And when he says that people are ripping him off and he invented this and blah, blah, blah,  people are going to buy it and you're one of those types of people that just step fast to believe it. 
[23:30]
 These guys hold up the signs and the deal and the fight is going on.  That's all Futter and John.  Dude, how about Butt Bongo Fiesta?  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Remember Butt Bongo?  I remember it well.  Call Howard and ask him where he got the idea from.  Where he got the idea from?  Not us. No, not us.  No, but see if he'll be honest with you.  I haven't got time to call him.  Ask him. Ask him.  Dude, ask him if he used to get tapes from Chicago and get copies of Steve Dahl's radio show. 
[24:00]
 Just ask him.  You had mentioned Steve before.  We're honest on this radio show. Ask him those two questions. See if you get a real answer. You won't.  I couldn't be too much with the guys.  You won't.  Listen, I don't believe you.  Hey Bill, what's up?  I was listening to Stern the day that he heard about Butt Bongo Fiesta and said he wanted to do it on the air.  Yeah, it was two DJs up in Maine.  Yeah, I heard it. The day he did that.  I remember that one because I was listening too.  You're saying he acknowledged it.  And then he took it as his own and... 
[24:30]
 This guy just said he acknowledged it and said, I want to do that.  Yeah, and he ripped it off.  And then after that he made it his own. That was it.  And now if anybody else does Butt Bongo Fiesta, they're going to say, oh, I invented that, Robin.  Right.  There's one of your guys.  This guy hasn't been original since Kinnison's mom.  You guys finally had balls enough to actually put me through, I'll give you that.  You always hang up and say, oh, you can't curse and I've never cursed.  No, because you come on and then you tell... I know who you are.  You tell a story and then you jump in with a baba buoy and start rolling. 
[25:00]
 I've never been a baba buoy in my life.  And after a while it gets stupid and boring, man.  But you point it off and say, you hung up because I cursed because you wanted to look like you're honest.  And I've never cursed. And you always say, oh, you can't curse, man.  Right or wrong?  Well, we let you throw to disgusting because you don't want to talk.  But right or wrong?  Now you're discussing.  Right or wrong is that what you're...  I would have to hear a tape. I don't know.  Come on, man. You know you're not doing it by...  I'm being honest. We hang up on plenty of people and think out of their curses on a daily basis.  I wouldn't call it a curse so I wouldn't get on a radio. I call it for the goof factor. 
[25:30]
 You know what? You guys go ahead. Keep copying. I'll keep listening.  There's nothing else on the radio.  Well, thank you, Bob. At least we got you every day.  That's true.  Okay. Every day.  Hey, Bill.  I'm with the train.  Bill, thank you.  No problem.  All right, man.  Bye.  There you go.  I'm going to go ahead and say that for as long as we did.  Whatever.  I know the faithful listeners know that we do enough original stuff on the show.  That's all that matters. I don't care. 
[26:00]
 We worked too hard to be labeled that.  And Howard gets to say that in the paper today and we're told we can't say a word about it.  So unless you're on the air just segging tunes or doing news or...  I don't know. I guess that's it.  If you're on the air just segging tunes or just a news broadcaster, you're ripping off Howard, right?  But the fact is we were thrown out of his press conference when we were trying to be team players  because the company told us to be team players.  So we figured we'd make the first move. 
[26:30]
 I even tried to get into his birthday party. I thought it would be cool just to hang.  I wasn't going to disrupt it. We weren't allowed to do that either.  No.  So...  Keeping us at distance.  We definitely try to be team players. We do work for the same company.  Yeah.  But it was a big deal that we were at his press conference yesterday. Such a big deal.  What is he scared of?  I don't know. We're not even in the same day part.  All right. Back to the smashing pumpkin CD.  Oh, yeah. 
[27:00]
 Then I'm jamming on the way to work.  We got a... How many do you want to give away? Like three?  All right. We'll give the new smashing pumpkin CD, the machine of God, to the 10th, 11th, and 12th callers right now.  212-757-1027. We're going to regroup and we'll be back. Stay there.  Holy and Anthony.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  Whippin' out Wednesday. Woohoo! 
[27:30]
 There it goes. This guy's very good over there.  He's there for me. The Hopi Show.  I like Anthony. Did you like Anthony?  We're going to Kinnison and we're finally asking Jackie to do Vegas and Jackie turning him down because there's not enough money.  I love Anthony.  You know, I forgot all about that. Anthony tapped into something. You remember that?  Didn't Kinnison once ask you to play with him and you turned him down?  I like Anthony too.  Thank you, Hopi.  Here's the Hopi and Anthony Show, our phone line 212-757-1027.  What's the fax line? 
[28:00]
 They've got this big NAW banner behind you because I guess Extra was supposed to be here today.  Interview the radio chick about the bra incident on Letterman with Kathie Lee Gifford.  And then Show, huh?  Fax line 212-957-WNEW.  This is Reveille, right?  Alright, let's go to Jim. Jim, you're next on NEW. What's going on, Jim? 
[28:30]
 Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You told us to listen to that guy last night.  Which one? Which show?  The one right after you.  Don and Mike?  Yeah.  And?  Not bad. It's like a dysfunctional family.  Well, they just started. You've got to give them time.  Not tonight, actually. Hey, I listened to them over Likus.  Unlike other high-profile jocks in this city, we're going to try to support the people we work with.  I tried to call in last night before and say what I learned.  And I was going to tell you guys that I was, for the first time in a month and a half, not going to listen to K-Rock at 7 o'clock. 
[29:00]
 Yeah, we don't want you listening to them anymore because we finally found a show that might work.  Yeah, exactly.  So we threw them a bone for a while when Likus was still here, but Likus is gone.  We have Don and Mike from Washington. They follow us now.  And I think you guys really should give them a chance before you trash them.  Not bad. Hey, real quick.  Give them at least three or four months. Have you checked out Ron and Fez after Don and Mike?  No, I'm up before 4 a.m. every morning.  Well, did you check them out, Ron and Fez? 
[29:30]
 No, because they go off to foreign. Some other stupid thing comes up.  Hey, real quick. Yesterday, talking to that chick with the Hummer thing, I found out the problem.  He's paying for them.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Yeah, I lost you, man.  I'm paying her to give them. Everyone went right over your head.  Yeah. All right, man. We have short-term memory problems.  Heavily medicated.  The one with the ball in her mouth that was giving him rung, he wasn't enjoying them. 
[30:00]
 Oh, the ball? Yeah, okay.  That's why he's not enjoying them anymore. You have to pay for them.  All right, I got you. Thank you, man.  We're moving on to new things today.  Please.  New things.  We can't keep track of what's going on here today. We can't rehash stuff from yesterday.  Except for the fact that we did have a great lesbian for a day at the end of the show.  Right at the end of the show. Fantastic.  We had the crappiest pictures. Whoever was taking the pictures should be fired.  Really bad?  Horrible. I had something going for the... what was her name? Karen with the big, huge young breasts? 
[30:30]
 They were nice and firm and stuff.  Yeah.  So I quickly went online this morning to check out the pictures on the unofficial website.  We got crappy pictures up there from last night's festivities.  What's wrong with them? Why are they crappy? Crappy quality or crappy poses?  I think we got pictures of their elbows.  Oh, really?  I'm serious. There's one good shot, but you don't know what they look like.  You can't really appreciate the big, huge hooters. Mark's got the video. 
[31:00]
 Yeah, I got the video.  Are you going to send the video to Steve?  Yeah, as soon as I can get it out to Steve. That was great yesterday.  Yeah, because there's some great clips there. We didn't think the girls were going to go at it.  We had the lesbian couch in here. There was no love connection.  The other girl, Galaxia, was all bummed out that Karen didn't really... she really wasn't into her.  And then out of nowhere, Karen just takes her top down.  She's got the huge hooters, and she goes, look, I'll let her do whatever she wants to me.  That was unbelievable.  Yeah, out of nowhere, I thought that nothing was going to be happening. 
[31:30]
 Score!  Yeah, it was a score. And then Karen just laid on her back and allowed Galaxia to go to...  Ha ha!  Galaxia, what kind of name is that? Right? It's Galaxia?  It's like that game you play in the arcade.  Yeah, isn't that a game? Galaxia?  Yeah, that is actually.  All right. We got some guys outside that want to do something crazy for the show.  This one guy's got the most incredible hat I've ever seen in an entire world.  Are you going to be able to leave work today, Mark? This is your day. Whip him out Wednesday.  Yeah, I can get fired today. 
[32:00]
 Huh?  Send him to TRL.  You want to go to TRL? Oh, Madonna's on TRL today.  TRL? Oh, that whore.  We should get some wow...  These guys have the best sign. That's the best wow I've ever seen.  All right, let's bring him in.  What, he's got a hat or something you're saying?  So his hat lights up like...  Get out of here.  Like Nagasaki.  Yeah, these guys, I guess, they're leaving or something and they want to walk down...  Paul, you can't...  Oh, now you're talking.  Put that hat on.  Look at this thing. This thing is out right. 
[32:30]
 He's got a construction hat with the famous Open Anthony Wow sticker.  And then on top of it, he has to have like a three-foot sign that lights up.  That is the goddamn funniest thing.  Dude, you're going to walk down the street with that?  Sure.  One of your bulbs are out.  That's a grounding problem.  You want to have like a...  All right, so what are you, electrician or tin knocker?  Oh, I need a...  Oh, what are you doing?  Exterminator.  How is that lighting up?  Exterminator.  I have too much time.  How is that lighting up, first of all? 
[33:00]
 Got a little motorcycle battery there?  Motorcycle battery?  Yeah.  He's got it on the side of his body there. All right.  God damn, if you get on a live shot with that thing, you'll be the king.  Why don't you guys like walk down Broadway toward TRL?  We'll have to...  You got a cell phone, right?  Give us a call and see how far he makes it because everyone's got to check out this sign.  It's hilarious.  This sign has to be on TV.  Are the other guys with you or they...  No, no, those guys, they just saw up here when I came in.  Oh, all right. And what's your name, man?  Larry.  Larry. And why do you want to do this, Larry? 
[33:30]
 Just for the hell of it?  Yeah, just for the hell of it.  And we'll throw you some prizes and stuff.  Oh, well, completely take care of you.  I mean, Jesus Christ, if that gets on TV, I will laugh my ass off.  It's a construction hat with the wow sticker and then just a huge, what, about three foot wow sign?  Yes.  That lights up.  Three foot by one foot.  And like the pole's about, I don't know, eight to 10 inches.  Yeah.  And the letters are well over a foot high.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Here, turn that on so we can get a picture for the underground website.  Look at that thing. 
[34:00]
 Put it on your head too. That'll make a good picture.  Awesome. Mark, can you kill a little time and go down there with him or what?  Big lit up wow.  Do you want to see if more people want to show up this afternoon?  We can have like a posse?  Big wow-age.  We'll wait a few minutes.  Yeah, you want to start it.  How about we just get people in the area?  We start at four o'clock.  Yep.  Four o'clock, where are you going to be?  Right downstairs in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  At 57th and 7th?  Yep.  In front of the Brooklyn Diner.  We'll just go for a little walk.  And then we'll just take a look at the food.  Yeah.  And then we'll just go to the food.  Yep. 
[34:30]
 In front of the Brooklyn Diner.  We'll just go for a little walk.  And then we'll just take a little, we'll make a little wow parade down at TRL today.  That's a great wow show.  That's hilarious.  It is so funny how it lights up.  All right, so at four o'clock in front of the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th,  if you want to join Psycho Mark and this crazy mofo.  Who are the other guys out there?  Some other guys came down.  You talked to them yesterday and said they want to come down  and go down and hang out with Mark today at TRL.  So they're here as well.  Yeah, bring them in.  Were they the ones that wowed on TV last night? 
[35:00]
 Dudes, what's up?  Were you the one on TV last night?  No.  Oh, because that sign looks familiar.  Wow.  What's your name, man?  I'm Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Lad.  Lad?  And who's the other dude?  Hey, Kerry, what's up?  Do you guys want to go down to TRL with that huge wow sign?  Yeah.  We're going to do like a little wow parade.  Yeah.  We're going to start it at four o'clock outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  We should see if we get some girls too, you know?  Yeah, we need a couple girls to show up.  Some authentic wowing going on.  I know this is last minute, but we can pull this off. 
[35:30]
 Four o'clock we'll be outside.  Oh, I invented wow.  That rocks.  I invented parades.  All right.  And then after you guys do this and go down to MTV and have some fun, come back to the  station, we'll hook you guys up with some good stuff, all right?  Thanks.  All right, man.  Where are you guys from, by the way?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Cool.  We like Jersey.  Long Island.  Long Island, yeah.  You guys live in the Port Jeff area?  Sure.  Sure.  I've hung out in Port Jeff a ton in the summertime. 
[36:00]
 Actually, I do work for, I think you guys show up at the Greenland Fire Department fair  sometimes?  Oh, yes.  The Greenland Fire Department's fair.  You do that every year?  Yep, I do work for them.  Oh, good deal.  All right, we'll see you guys outside at four o'clock.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thanks, dude.  Goddamn, is that funny.  It's really funny.  It's the best wow sign I've ever seen.  I can't wait to see that on TV.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  How are you, man?  How are you?  All right, man.  Good.  Listen, I wanted to talk to you about Don and Mike. 
[36:30]
 I used to listen to those guys down in Washington.  I used to drive down there.  Those guys are pretty good, man.  I mean, you know, for seven o'clock run, you know?  Yeah, they're on after us here in New York, and yeah, we're going to give them a chance,  you know?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, man.  They're definitely worth listening to, you know?  I mean, that's like the best radio that they have down there in Washington and Virginia,  man.  I mean, the only thing they got is how it in the morning, and you got to wait until seven  o'clock at night.  Actually, they're on at two o'clock down there. 
[37:00]
 Yeah.  You got to get them at two o'clock.  Well, that's the only thing that goes on.  I like them a lot better than Lycus, so.  Yeah, Lycus really sucked, man.  And we really got to start supporting some more shows around here, or we're going to  be screwed.  Listen, let me ask you a question, man.  Don't come to you off.  I just want to ask you seriously.  Look.  Yeah.  I'm not going to curse or nothing, but.  You guys are going to get us in so much trouble.  No, no, no.  We're really going to move on.  Go.  Look, I'm not going to say nothing.  Go.  All I'm saying is that you guys say, I mean, you guys are good.  I'm a good fan, and you know, I look at you guys all the time.  You're not going down in the mornings, but if you did, I know you guys are team players, 
[37:30]
 you know, you're on the same cup being everything, but if you guys went in the mornings, you  actually think that you would, you know, beat Howard.  I'm not going to go in the mornings.  Well.  I know you're not going in the mornings, but I'm saying, if you guys did go to the mornings,  you actually think that you would, you know, match up against Howard's Raiders.  Mike, let me tell you the guy's honest truth and soapy speaking, okay?  I would love to go to mornings and see what we could do.  I mean, you guys are good, man.  I'm not saying I'm a competitive person, and I would love to see, you know, what we could 
[38:00]
 do against them, sure.  That's my God's honest answer.  Will it happen?  I don't think so.  I like you guys, man.  I think you guys are good.  I mean, I'm not putting you guys down at all.  You know, don't get me wrong.  I'm not afraid to go up against them.  I want to see, you know, how good we are.  You know, might as well go up against the best in New York.  Well, that's true.  But it's not going to happen.  I know that.  You guys get good ratings in the afternoons.  You think you'd get them in the morning.  That's all I'm saying.  I mean, isn't that where the most radio is in the morning?  Mike, it would be a bear. 
[38:30]
 It would take a long time.  Especially working for the same company.  Right.  I know.  Then we wouldn't be able to compete the way we would want to.  I would love to give it a shot.  Could we win?  Of course.  I think we could win, sure.  Why don't you guys move to K-Rock?  Then you guys will have a real radio station.  They had dumped us.  You guys weren't on K-Rock.  That's just another story for another day.  K-Rock could have had us, and then they didn't want us.  That would be better than, what's his name, a tool clock, that's for sure. 
[39:00]
 I don't even know who's on it against us anymore.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  You guys, you've got to move on from this.  We're done with that.  We do all live phones.  You're just going to get us screwed.  So please move on.  I think we've spent enough time on it.  Adam, what's going on?  O&A.  How's it going?  Good.  Radio chick O&A in Don and Mike.  That's some quality radio there, guys. 
[39:30]
 Remember them last night?  They were great.  They were hysterical.  They had me rolling.  Well, that's what we want.  You know?  Yeah, that's good stuff.  Well, cool.  I'm glad you like it so far.  And I think if they keep the line up exactly how it is, radio chick, and then you guys,  and then Don and Mike, that's just ratings galore right there.  Well, we believe so.  We will see.  We definitely believe so.  Okay, you guys suck.  All right. 
[40:00]
 Thanks, Adam.  All right.  Bye.  I mean, the deal is, Ant and I are nearing two years in New York.  Yep.  Let me just get this out of the way, okay?  We really need to start supporting the other shows here at NAW.  Or at least giving them a chance.  There hasn't been anything worth supporting for a while.  No, for the last two years, Ant and I have worked for a station that is still in last  place.  Dead last.  Dead freaking last.  We're doing well, thank you.  Ant and I consistently do three times the ratings of any other show on this station. 
[40:30]
 That's a fact.  That's a fact.  We are number one in all the key demos in afternoon drive.  That's a fact.  Yes.  Okay?  The problem is, that's not good enough to keep a station going.  No.  If this station continues to be in last place, there's going to be a major problem.  Yeah, they'll do something.  Something drastic that won't include Ant and I.  So we have to support the new shows and give them a chance, okay?  Ant and I only have a little over a year left in our contract. 
[41:00]
 Yeah.  Let me say it right now.  A year from now, if this station is in last, I have no desire to re-up.  No.  No desire whatsoever.  Do we want to stay in New York?  Do we want to stay at NAW?  Yes.  But oh my God, could you imagine having to sign on to the station in last place again?  Oh, when we got here, all the stories we heard of how great it was going to be in a matter  of months.  Right.  And to be honest with you, a year from now, if the station is still in last, I don't think 
[41:30]
 the company is going to put up with it.  Right.  So it's kind of like we're up to do or die.  I mean, a year goes by like that.  So we are going to support all the new shows.  We really like the radio chick now.  She has proven herself.  And we're going to give the other shows a chance and then we'll see what happens.  Yeah, we're not going to write off the bat trash anyone.  We'll give them a chance.  If they suck, you'll know it.  We'll know it. 
[42:00]
 Yeah, we're not going to make believe.  We don't fake it.  We're not going to make believe it's a great show.  Come on.  Why couldn't you do that for me?  When it's obviously a bad show.  I'm gone.  But we're going to give them a solid three or four months before we make any opinions.  That's a definite.  Yeah.  You know?  All right, let's move on.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, you're next on N.E.W. What's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Tom Green last night.  And the Lewinsky thing?  It was so good.  You liked it, huh?  It was... 
[42:30]
 I thought they...  I don't know.  There were a lot of funny things going on.  I want to thank Tom Green for calling our show yesterday.  That was pretty cool.  I just liked the way...  I mean, it was a little different obviously than the rest of his shows.  Right.  But they built it up.  They took an entire town.  They played with them for an entire week.  And the big announcement was handbags.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They went to...  If you didn't watch last night, I'm sure no one MTV, they'll run it another 10 times  in the next month.  Tom Green took Lewinsky back to his hometown in Vancouver. 
[43:00]
 And then they created a media frenzy saying they had a huge announcement.  And the announcement was something really, really stupid about what?  Vancouver being the fabric capital of the universe or something?  Yeah, Ottawa, something like that.  And then they showed a couple of handbags they made out of Tom Green's parents' bedspread.  You just got lucky the way that they had the media following them around for a week.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  For three days.  All right, well, three days.  The best part of the show was when Tom Green, he does a lot. 
[43:30]
 He goes and wakes up his parents at four in the morning.  Yeah.  And his father wakes up and goes, oh, Monica, hi.  Just completely like surprises him with Monica Lewinsky in the middle of the night.  It was pretty funny.  She had her hobbist knob.  That's what we said to Tom yesterday.  He didn't look bad.  Really?  How's she looking?  I didn't see it.  Neck down.  Neck down.  Neck down?  No, I think her face is not bad.  Is she still plump?  Yeah, she's still a little chubby.  She depends on what angle you're looking at her. 
[44:00]
 She seems to have a really nice personality, though.  She was very bubbly.  Yeah.  I think if Tom Green could get her on his show, then we could get Monica on our show.  I think if we played our cards right, I think she would come on this show.  Let's try to get that together.  You mean get her on the couch?  Get her on the couch.  Monica.  At least we should talk to her on the phone or something.  Yeah.  She had a really cool personality.  We'll look at her.  I think we will.  MTV will be running it again. 
[44:30]
 It definitely was a pretty good Tom Green show last night.  Hey, one other question for you guys.  Have you ever seen a show on the Food Network called The Iron Chef?  No.  I want to talk about it.  It's Friday night's most intense show on TV.  It's a Japanese overdub show in English that treats cooking like a sport.  Cool.  Really?  Yes.  I can't deal with the Food Network.  No, this isn't Food Network.  It could be on ESPN.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, I'll look for it.  All right. 
[45:00]
 Thanks a lot, guys.  See you next time.  Thank you, Andy.  All right.  All right, man.  We've got to take a break.  Anthony, we'll be back with more of your phone calls in just a bit.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Thank you, Vince.  Where's Vince, man?  CBS is trying to, what, get SmackDown on CBS.  Oh, yeah?  Comes in the business section of the paper today, right? 
[45:30]
 Yeah.  You know, Linda McMahon, Vince's wife, is the one that's in charge of the whole frigging  shebang.  She is truly the CEO of the company and she's really the one that deals with the stockholders  and everything.  Isn't that something?  And what does Vince do then?  He's like a figurehead.  He's a PR guy, you know?  Yeah.  He goes out and shakes the hands of a cheese-like fish.  Like the brains.  That's about that.  So what's the deal?  I mean, CBS just wants to get SmackDown on Channel 2 or whatever or?  Yeah.  SmackDown's on what?  Channel 9 now?  Yeah. 
[46:00]
 Yeah, they want to get it on CBS.  That would be huge for the WWF.  Yeah.  Huge.  Yes.  And they reported earnings, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[46:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How are you?  Hi, my goodness.  How are you?  I didn't know I was on.  You startled me with the ringing of the phone when I picked you up.  Yeah, I was dialing on my other phone to make a phone call.  Oh, it's Opie and Anthony and you're live on our show.  Okay.  I'm just calling in to ring in to my boyfriend Rich who was initiated into the Hummer Tuesday 
[47:00]
 Club yesterday.  Or Tuesday Hummer Club.  Either way.  Hummer Club.  All right.  And he wanted me to do this for him.  To what?  To hob his knob or to call the radio show?  and let you guys know that he was initiated.  Oh, right on.  What's his name?  Rich.  And where does he work?  He works for KeyStand Energy.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  So now everyone there knows he got a hummer last night from you.  Yes, they do.  Well, thank you for supporting the radio show and hobbing his knob. 
[47:30]
 Anytime.  How was it?  Was it all right?  Well, I didn't get a that a girl.  Oh, really?  Well, because it went a little too far into excitement  got turned into something else.  Oh, I got some sex.  Yeah, some all out.  Yeah, sweaty sex.  Yeah.  That's what those hummers usually end up.  Yeah.  Oh, nothing wrong with that.  Nothing at all.  All right.  Well, thanks for sharing today.  No problem. 
[48:00]
 All right.  Bye.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  Let's go to Sue.  Sue has a problem with something associated with our radio show.  Sue, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I'm waiting forever.  OK, listen.  You guys have the official or unofficial girl?  The Opiant 3 girl?  The unofficial website is doing the girls of ONA.  Yeah, there's a section on the website.  I know.  I saw it.  Do you know that one of them is a prostitute?  All right.  An extra added treat. 
[48:30]
 That would figure.  No, I'm dead serious.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let's take this a little slow.  OK, go ahead.  I want to get everyone up to speed.  The unofficial Opiant 3 website, www.foundrymusic.com,  has the girls of ONA section, where we encourage the ladies  of our show to send in some launching pictures of themselves.  And then the listeners vote on who the hottest girl is,  and then they win stuff, I guess.  Not really associated with our show officially, but that's why  it's unofficial.  Yeah, but Steve's doing it, and he's 
[49:00]
 doing a great job with that.  Now, you're saying that one of the girls up there now  is a prostitute.  Yeah.  How do you know that?  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  No, not allegedly.  No, this is for sure, and I can back up what I say.  Well, how do you know?  I know this girl.  They're triple nipple, OK?  All right, but don't say her name now.  No, I'm not going to say her name.  OK, how do you know?  Well, how do you first define prostitute?  OK, well, getting paid for sex.  Yeah, like for real sex? 
[49:30]
 Yes, constantly, every day.  This girl is rich from the sex.  I'm serious.  Oh, yeah?  I'm dead serious.  How do you know, though?  Because I was actually friends with her.  Yeah.  And she introduced me to the lady she worked for.  OK.  And the lady had offered me, and I said no.  And she actually asked me to drive her somewhere,  which I did. 
[50:00]
 And one of the guys just happened to be  I swear to God, I know half the guy.  These guys are like bad.  I mean, you guys would know who I'm talking about.  I just think that.  So you have a problem with that.  Why?  I have a problem because if she's  going to represent you guys on the unofficial site, it's wrong.  All right.  For somebody to represent you like that.  First of all, until we hear from her,  I'm not believing what you say. 
[50:30]
 I don't know who you are or what agenda you might have.  I can completely back up everything I said.  Hold on, Steve.  For the unofficial website is on the line.  He wants to comment about your charges.  Let's go to our buddy Steve.  Steve?  I thought we were having fun.  What's up, Steve?  What happened?  What happened?  Uh-oh.  You're on the line with Sue.  Sue?  Hi.  Have you got evidence to substantiate your claim here? 
[51:00]
 Yes, I do.  How can you back this up?  We need concrete proof.  I can give you concrete evidence.  How?  What kind of evidence?  I can't say it on the air, but I can get it for you.  Pictures?  What?  Pictures, people.  Well, see.  You know, I know the service that she works for.  She's on.  OK, she actually.  Don't give too much info away, please, Sue. 
[51:30]
 And who cares?  Well, yeah.  You guys don't care?  We don't care about if there's a prostitute up there.  Ultimately, we'd kind of discourage that kind of behavior.  Well, come on, guys.  You guys are better than that.  No.  Ultimately, it's not the hookers of Opie and Anthony,  but, you know, well, you can always change the title.  I mean, she's going to represent your site.  Would she have the knob of one of our listeners, you think?  Anytime.  For a price.  I can sign anywhere, any day.  Yeah, maybe you could spin this into something. 
[52:00]
 No, no.  Yeah, we can.  She was on K-Lock also, and the totally bastard, too.  She gets on every radio station that she can.  Information that only you guys would know  if I wasn't on the air.  And Sue, why are you associating with Horace, then?  I'm not associating with her anymore.  You drove her to some appointments.  I went with her.  Look at you.  No, no, no.  I didn't do anything.  I said no.  Yeah, Sue.  I am not.  I am not.  You met her boss.  What?  You met her boss.  Yeah, I met her boss. 
[52:30]
 So why would you agree to meet with, let's just call her a madam?  Why would you agree to meet with a madam?  OK.  If you knew she was a madam.  Wait.  First of all, no, no.  First of all, I didn't agree to meet with her.  We went over to this lady's house, OK?  And she introduced me and then started talking about it.  I actually didn't know ahead of time until we got there.  Oh.  How much did she offer you?  What was it? 
[53:00]
 She takes 50 and the girls take 150.  For what?  For coming out on calls.  How much time do you get for that?  What do you have to do?  An hour.  An hour?  Is it an hour of anything?  Anything.  Like I could suggest a but?  Anything.  You name it, you got it.  She does all.  And you didn't go for it?  They have a website.  Seems like you can make a lot of money, Sue.  Well, she's the one who's making the money.  Not me, because I choose not to do it. 
[53:30]
 Because I do have some respect for myself.  Did you think about doing it?  Absolutely not.  No, huh?  No, absolutely not.  All right.  How much would it take?  On nothing.  I wouldn't take it.  I wouldn't do it.  Nothing, maybe?  No, no, no.  I'd take that back.  I wouldn't do it.  It wouldn't be that good.  Hold on.  Becky wants to verify Sue's story.  Let's bring Becky.  It's like a party line.  Yeah.  Becky.  Becky.  Ba-ba-booey.  Well.  Wrong one. 
[54:00]
 OK.  Hold on.  I got to do this.  Do, do, do, do.  You made us screw the phones up.  All right.  Steve, so what are you thinking?  I think you know something.  How does this chick, what reason does she have for calling you  guys up and saying stuff like this?  Yeah, why are you mad at this girl, Sue?  That you would call her out like this?  I'm not mad at the girl.  I'm kind of upset with you guys because you're letting somebody. 
[54:30]
 We can't have background checks on everyone that is associated  with the show.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm letting you in on it.  I know you want me to.  And our listeners all want to know how they could hire this  girl for an hour.  I swear to God.  You want the website?  No, we don't want the website.  Well, I'm just telling you guys are too good for that.  At least I think that.  Is there a picture on the website  of being like a prostitute?  Actually, OK. 
[55:00]
 There's prostitute websites now?  No, it's a stripper site.  That's the cover-up.  Well, wait a minute.  You just called her a prostitute five minutes ago.  Well, it's a stripper site, but that's the cover-up.  All right.  I have to use a cover-up.  They're in the yellow pages.  All right.  Well, Sue, thanks for bringing this to our attention.  One of the girls associated with the girls of O&A is a  prostitute.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  I've never heard of them on the site.  So, OK.  OK.  Just wanted to let you guys know. 
[55:30]
 All right.  Well, we appreciate the information, Sue.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Kiss now.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  So, Steve, how are you today?  Uh, it was great.  Yeah?  No, you know something?  I, you know, I'm generally a pretty cynical guy.  So until I see a whole pile of proof, I'm really inclined not  to believe Sue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, who knows?  Maybe she's friends with one of the other chicks who's, you  know, who's...  We're just not getting a lot of girls emailing their pictures 
[56:00]
 for that section.  No.  No.  You know something?  There's actually a whole bunch, a whole bunch waiting in  the wings.  I had to verify with Anthony that he wanted to pay for  another vacation.  I guess this week, this month, we're giving one away to  Las Vegas and...  Lemo Anthony, hope you're not mad.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Not you.  I pay for enough vacations.  Now they, I just want to make sure with him he was going to  do it.  So the next vacation that Anthony from Top Notch, Lemo pays 
[56:30]
 for is going to go to Florida, I think.  Oh, really?  And you have a girl standing by and you can put their pictures  up soon?  Yeah.  There's going to be three more.  But what happened was like the voting was all messed up.  I had this poll set up, but I guess people were going back and  voting like 150 times.  Oh, yeah.  So if you added up all the votes, you would add up to like  40,000.  So I had to reset it this morning.  OK.  But now, you know something?  Until I see a whole pile of proof, I really am inclined not  to believe Sue.  Sorry.  Well, thank you, Steve.  You're doing a fine job with that website. 
[57:00]
 Yes.  I was thinking about coming in tomorrow to pick up all the  tapes and to give Mark back his existing ones.  Yeah, because you got some horrible shots of the Lesbian  for a Day from yesterday.  I'm sorry.  I miss that when it goes on.  I know you didn't take those pictures.  You worked with what you were given.  But Mark's got some great video from yesterday's  festivities, and we want to share with everybody.  Oh, I'm sure you do.  So come on by for that tomorrow.  OK.  All right, there's Steve from the unofficial  Opium Anthony website.  www.foundrymusic.com. 
[57:30]
 All right, Steve?  See you guys soon.  All right, cool.  Later.  Before we take a break, we've got to go to Camille.  Camille is outside TRL wowing.  Camille, what's going on?  Me and my friend came down from upstate.  We're wowing TRL.  Have you made it on TV yet?  The TV's shot at us a few times.  I think we have.  Your actual naked boobies.  Hello?  Excuse me.  Yeah, Camille.  Oh.  Hello.  I'm sorry.  I'm on a pay phone.  All right, throw it.  We'd like to come down to the station today.  Thank you for using my name.  Well, throw a quarter in, man. 
[58:00]
 That I can do.  That I can do.  Maybe they should wait for Psycho Mark and the Psycho  Facts.  That's what I'm going to tell them.  We'll see you guys later on.  Wait.  Camille, we've got a bunch of people from the station coming  down with huge wow signs.  You'll know who they are.  Find them, OK?  And they'll bring you back to the station after you wow.  No doubt.  All right, bye.  Take it easy, guys.  You guys suck.  All right, bye, Camille.  All right, Anthony.  The wow parade is about ready to leave the station.  Yes.  We have Psycho Mark.  A bunch of psychopaths have shown up. 
[58:30]
 One guy has this huge wow sign that lights up on his head.  Yeah, it's got like a helmet and a big metal wow with lights  in it and everything.  It lights up wow.  You ready to leave, Psycho Mark?  Yeah, did that girl just say she's wowing down at the TRL?  Yeah, I told her to look for you.  You're going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  Like right now, you're leaving, right?  Oh, right down stairs.  And then you guys are going to march before TRL is over.  Call us when you hit the street, Mark.  All right.  We'll check in with Psycho Mark next.  Stay there.  Opie.  Keep your hands away from your pants. 
[59:00]
 Ah, too late.  And Anthony.  Ah, this appointment's bad.  It's more stupid to be on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Opie, how about today?  Just the best way you guys can come up with.  1027 WNEW.  Lots going on on the show today.  Psycho Mark has left the building with some psychopaths.  They're going to cause trouble somewhere on live TV, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We're hoping Psycho Mark checks in in a little bit here. 
[59:30]
 They're going to be heading down to the MTV studios.  There's a bunch of people down there.  Yeah, they should be outside on 57th and 7th right now,  right outside the Brooklyn Diner.  The one guy has a huge wow sign attached to a construction hat.  Yeah, like a hard hat.  A hard hat, excuse me.  Big sheet metal wow with lights in it.  Looks pretty cool.  Really lights up right. 
[60:00]
 This could be him, but Spaz, you got to...  God damn it.  It could be Psycho Mark on the line.  Spaz decided to let the retard answer the phones for him.  I guess not.  Who is it?  Once in a while?  Oh, really?  Why are they calling on the special line?  We have a bunch of retards that still work here. 
[60:30]
 I know.  I don't think we can understand.  We have people that all you have to do, I'm telling you,  is just show up to the show, say, hey, I'm here to see  Opie and Anthony.  You could be a psychopath.  It doesn't matter.  And they allow you to come right down to the station,  to the studio.  And they're giving away the hotline that's really important  to our radio show.  It's just people that want to call in with stupid crap.  Here, do you want to get a hold of them?  Call this number. 
[61:00]
 Why are they doing that?  Because they're stupid and they're retarded.  Why would you give out the special phone numbers  for a radio show?  Those are the numbers like Jay Moore uses in celebrities  and stuff, you know?  Psycho Mark.  What's up, guys?  Where are you?  The crowd is growing.  We're walking down Broadway right now.  We're at Broadway in 56.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We've got a bunch of people walking around. 
[61:30]
 It's very crazy.  Looks like they're protesting for something.  People don't even know what we're doing.  They're all looking at us.  Is that one guy wearing his big shoes?  Yeah, he's just a hot guy.  Hold on.  I'm going to take a quick look.  Oh, they're all there.  Oh, my God.  They're walking down.  We saw them for a second out the window.  How many people are with you, Mark?  Right now, we've got about 15 guys with us.  OK.  And actually, it's growing.  We're walking down the street. 
[62:00]
 People are joining us.  I'm kind of like the Five Viper here.  Oh, very nice.  Now, where are you right now?  Right now, we're in 55th and Broadway.  OK.  We're almost by the Letterman Theater.  All right.  And we'll be moving our way right down to TRL.  And we're going to aggravate the piss out of MTV again.  All right, hold on one sec.  Why is that line still?  Why is he still talking to that perth?  Thank you.  Oh.  See, now, you know, I swear to God,  I just want to walk and go home today. 
[62:30]
 No one cares around here.  They've given out our special phone number to anyone.  It just keeps ringing because some retard upstairs  is giving everyone the number.  Who gave them the number?  Hey, Mark, sorry.  Who's giving out the number?  The retard upstairs.  You're kidding me.  Oh!  People are vaping on the street.  This is great.  How many more people have joined you, man?  Well, right now, it's about, I'd say, almost 20 people  right now.  All right.  And you're on Broadway. 
[63:00]
 And what side streets there?  Now we're down to 54th, 54th and Broadway.  Hold on, Spaz got an explanation for me.  Hold on.  Yes, Spaz?  Virginia, the receptionist upstairs  is pissed that you're calling her a retard  and she wants to talk to you.  The exception is I've saved your butt a lot of times.  How long?  Because you bring a lot of whack.  We officially call you a retard because you just  gave out the phone number to everyone.  You're live on the show, you idiot.  I didn't give it out to anyone.  You just said the number.  We had to dump out. 
[63:30]
 Who did I give it to?  That's a definition of a retard.  First of all, I didn't give it to anybody.  No, this posted out in the lobby.  All right, well, take it down.  Why should I?  I didn't put it there.  Because someone votes upstairs and take it.  My job is to sit here at the front desk.  Right.  And I try to make it as nice and smooth for people  to come downstairs.  If you guys don't come up and take  care of the people that are up in the lobby,  you're going to have problems.  And if the phone is listed outside,  you're going to have the whole world calling. 
[64:00]
 Well, who?  I'm not a retard.  And I don't like anyone calling me a retard.  First of all, I happen to be a very good receptionist.  And I've been here a lot longer than you guys have.  So I don't ever do that before.  Thank you.  Bye.  Hey, how did a computer get stolen from a hello?  Ah, she hung up.  Retard.  Did somebody let somebody in the building  and they actually stole a computer right out of the house?  First of all, I didn't call her a retard by name. 
[64:30]
 I was assuming that it was someone else taking her place.  But she does let a lot of stupid people down to this floor.  Oh, this is what we have to deal with.  Oh, boy.  Mark.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  We just lost her.  There's Earl.  Where is he going?  He's recording.  Everyone is.  Oh, I had fun.  There are people joining us.  And we've got people driving by. 
[65:00]
 This is Clay.  We've got people joining us at the entry stage.  We've got to lay out and keep the trouble.  We're waiting to see you guys show up on the TV screen.  We're down by 52nd right now in Broadway.  So if you care to join us.  You can't miss us.  We've got about 12 huge signs.  We're walking around like, is this Diallo just got shot again?  Oh, my god.  You're doing your own little protest, right?  What's that?  You're doing your own little protest. 
[65:30]
 Yeah, right.  All right.  How many blocks away are you?  You've got to be close to this point.  We're real close.  We're a four-block right now.  All right.  Why is everyone screaming?  I think it's just like a party atmosphere, OP.  You can tell.  They're freaking out.  It's locked by the gate.  All right, Mark.  I think we're losing your signal.  It's a massive after.  All right.  So we suggest people meet you down there at TRL, huh?  I'll check back in as soon as we're outside. 
[66:00]
 OK.  See you later.  Thank you.  So now we've got people mad at us upstairs, it seems like, OP.  Well, I will be talking to someone about it  in a professional manner.  There are a lot of people that get through our tight security,  Anthony.  Well, the security is obviously a joke,  and that is based on past experience.  Security at this place blows. 
[66:30]
 We had lawyers trying to serve us papers,  and we told everyone, don't let anyone in.  And sure enough, we walked outside to get coffee,  and we're being served with papers.  They can't even do that right.  And there are people, and I didn't point anyone out  Virginia, that allow people to come down here, that give out  our special phone numbers.  We have two or three special phone numbers 
[67:00]
 for very important people of the radio show.  If Jay Moore wants to call in, he could call this number,  and it's guaranteed it's going to be free.  Right.  But there are people up there, and I didn't name them by name,  that give out all these numbers.  And there are people that do work the front desk  that just allow anyone downstairs.  Remember the wallet that got stolen out of here?  And then you know what they do?  Then they make our life a living hell, a pain in the ass.  Like what happened? 
[67:30]
 Somebody walked in, just walked in one of the doors,  and stole someone's wallet or something, or pocketbook,  and just walked right out.  Walked in, walked out.  What did they do?  They battened down the hatches and wouldn't give us  the codes to the doors.  So don't let Opie and Anthony in.  But anybody else, any kook that wants to just  wimose down the stairs, feel free.  Oh my god.  What a mess. 
[68:00]
 And why is any of our phone numbers posted outside  the door of the station up there?  It should just be the request line, that's all.  No, it's our special line.  So now we've got to get all new special lines.  Hello, brother.  I got a receptionist yelling at me.  Hey, she's been here longer than us.  That's what it takes.  Remember when we used to hear that?  Yeah.  From everybody? 
[68:30]
 All the old timers try to pull that on us all the time.  Been here longer.  That's the prerequisite.  Receptionist for what, 20, 30 years?  Good.  Got some serious career goals there.  Nice.  Good to say.  Oh boy.  Much best.  People want to apply for the receptionist job.  Oh yeah?  Yeah. 
[69:00]
 I'm going to look into that, maybe.  A receptionist yelling at us.  That's good.  I love this company.  All right.  Mike, you're next.  What's going on, man?  I just listened to TRL, and they said  that they're going to let a fan from outside interview Madonna.  Oh really?  Yeah, so if one of the wow posse get on.  Yeah, I don't see that happening. 
[69:30]
 All right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  I think they're going to be very, very aware of the wow  people when they show up.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I'm in an Astro van.  I'm walking right next to the guys that are getting ready  to wow TRL.  And my van's totally open.  And if they get into trouble, they can bail out.  Oh really?  Oh yeah, waiting for them.  Following them right now.  You're not making dough about just hanging out.  You're right behind them?  I'm right with them, walking right next to them.  How many people?  I'll have them scream for you.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I got them on the line.  Scream. 
[70:00]
 All right.  Wow, the little parade is growing.  Did you get that?  It's about 15, 20 guys out there right now.  How close are they, Tony?  We're right here at the.  Yeah, because they just went live.  They're live right now.  Yeah, we're 46th and Broadway.  You're just about there.  All right.  Tell Mark to call me back, OK?  All right, no problem.  All right, thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, you're next on any W.  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Just watching a little TRL here. 
[70:30]
 Still haven't seen any boobage.  Right.  We're waiting to see Psycho Mark.  He's just about there.  He should be calling in any second.  All right, cool.  And hey, just think, at least the receptionist  isn't letting Patty downstairs anymore.  Sorry I had to bring that up.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  I want to see the big lit up wow sign on the guy's head on TV.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Oh, we're at 46th and Broadway, and the window is in sight.  Yes. 
[71:00]
 Yeah, we're coming right down the street,  and we're going to do our best to allow that nasty man  to come out.  OK.  So we're making our way right now in the middle of the street.  I'm trying to get hit by a bus.  Yeah, don't get hit.  So we're going to try and set ourselves  up in the middle of the street.  But there's tons of people down here.  It's crazy.  Yeah, they're live right now.  I noticed that.  This is KCM. 
[71:30]
 We're calling you now.  All right, all right.  Help!  Help!  All right, we're on.  I don't see you guys yet.  You're right there, right, Mark?  Yeah, I'm right outside.  Oh, I see you.  It was a quick shot of you.  I saw the big sign.  There it is, right there.  All right.  Right there, the whole wow parade's  right in the middle of Carson Valley and Madonna.  Wow, there's the big dude's side. 
[72:00]
 OK, very good.  Oh, there's a hook over here.  It's a big wow sign.  They were right behind Madonna's butt.  Big wow sign.  Hey, Mark, how many signs are out there, man?  How many signs are out there?  We got a bunch of signs, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.  We got a bunch of crazy signs.  All right.  He's not standing out here.  He's not standing right here. 
[72:30]
 Stand back here.  Just stand in the middle.  I'm just going to go across the street.  That's all.  What's the problem?  The cops are out here.  How do you know they're not?  That's what I'm saying.  Uh-oh.  They're getting a little awkward.  Oh, boy.  They're getting hassled.  Come on.  I'm trying to move us around.  It's kind of funny.  Come on, officers.  Hey, Mark, what's happening?  Well, anyway, there's got to be at least 3,000 or 4,000 people  outside of MTV Studios.  It's a complete zoo.  Yeah. 
[73:00]
 We've got a bunch of other radio stations  we're trying to drive to and by, but not  doing a very good job of it.  Yeah.  And there's actually a bunch of people  out here with wild signs.  There was a couple trips across the state.  We actually were really scared.  She's going to be wild-eyed.  And hopefully, maybe we can see some chance on TRL Live.  All right.  First thing, she's about to go back up live.  And here we go.  We're going to move.  The cops are making us move.  All right.  You're live.  You're live.  All right.  Oh, there you are.  I see the wow.  Yeah.  The wow right behind Madonna there. 
[73:30]
 Uh-oh.  They're hiding from our crowd.  We aren't surrounded by cops.  They're making us get off the street.  Oh, brother.  Oh, that sucks.  They're calling everybody to cordon off over here.  It's pretty wild.  Where's the girl with the wild sign?  What's her name?  Camille.  Camille?  Where you from?  Upstate New York.  She's from Upstate New York.  And you came all the way down here with a wild sign?  Yup.  I'm from Florida.  She called me over.  She's all the way from Upstate.  She's got a big orange wild sign.  And the-  Yeah, I saw that one.  Yeah.  It's right up below the window there.  But we're going to try and cross the street  and get some more time shot over there. 
[74:00]
 Right that way.  Hi.  One side or the other?  One side.  We're going to go to the other side of the street.  Oh, boy.  All right.  It's a hassle, but we're just going to just keep  moving our way around here.  Hi, man.  In front of all of your teeny boppers here.  Madonna's still attracting teeny boppers.  Hey, we might be on right now.  We got- here we go.  Woo!  He's got a little interior!  Yeah, they're-  He's got a little interior!  They're trying to keep the wow sign off, dude.  They're making- they're doing tight shots.  I see one of you guys raising your arms. 
[74:30]
 That was pretty good.  Yeah, and an apple tag in a punch.  Yeah, you guys are like on the very corner of the screen,  Mark.  Yeah, very tight security there for the Madonna appearance.  All right, I'm out of here.  I'm going to go stand on the sidewalks.  I'm getting really nasty works from the cops.  They're about to punch my teeth out.  Ah.  I'm going to get tuned up in about two seconds.  Tuned up.  Yeah, what's up?  I'm Detective Tamiko.  You're annoying my captain.  All right, don't stop. 
[75:00]
 You're going to lose the flag and you're going to get locked up.  All right, use your head and be smart.  All sides enjoy yourself.  All right.  Stop walking around in the intersection with an asshole like yourself.  Okay.  What's the search on your side, Detective Tamiko?  A midtown shop.  Very good.  Turn him on.  Okay.  Uh, they want the tune up.  They're going to get tuned up.  Oh, good.  He was all business, though.  It was- he's wearing a suit.  He hasn't even worn a uniform.  Hey.  He was not happy.  Yeah, he didn't sound it.  We'll have to stand here with the rest of the, uh, the words. 
[75:30]
 All right, Mark.  Hang on.  We'll check back in and, uh, we'll see what we can do.  All right, very good.  Psycho Mark, uh, reporting live from outside the MTV studios.  It's a- it's a mob scene down there for- for Madonna.  Thank you, Psycho Mark.  Cops hassling him and everything.  Damn.  They're very serious about, uh, keeping traffic clear, I guess, or something.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Not too bad.  Good.  These guys are great, man.  I've seen that guy with the hat. 
[76:00]
 Oh, you saw the hat guy on- on MTV?  Yeah, he's right out of the corner right there.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great, man.  All right, cool.  Now, listen, syndication now.  You guys suck.  All right, thank you, Jim.  Bye.  Let's go to Ron.  Ron, you're next on N-E-W.  Hey, Rowan, hey.  How you doing, guys?  All right, what's up?  Hey, great.  I'm glad to see you guys again.  I saw it just 10 seconds on the lower right-hand corner, right behind, but that was behind,  and they saw a little bit of a wild sign out there.  Yeah, they're having a tough time today because it's a mob scene.  They ought to go somewhere else where they get their real-life shots and stuff.  Maybe if we get lucky, maybe by 2 news, who knows what's going to happen next? 
[76:30]
 I mean, that live- that, uh, wow, the lit-up wow hat?  Yeah.  Got to get that on TV.  That's going to be a- that's going to be a classic right there.  Yeah, we got to find out where all the TV crews are sitting up today.  If anyone knows, let us know, okay?  I sure- by the way, I got the picture back from you guys.  The picture I took from you last time was possible.  If you come down one of these days and sign those pictures?  Yeah, one of these days, no problem.  You got it.  We're just in kind of a bad mood today though.  Don't worry, just keep a straight face, all right?  All right, thank you.  All right, bye.  Yeah, we're all moody.  We have receptionists, uh, yelling at us. 
[77:00]
 Giving out the phone number.  All right, let's, uh, take a break, Anthony.  All right.  And we'll be back.  See you then.  Hey kids!  It's your old pal Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy,  I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show.  Syndication now!  Hey, I'm John Stewart and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027WAW.  These guys have problems, but you know that. 
[77:30]
 Yes, we do, John.  Yes, we do, John.  All right, I think we need to regroup, Anthony.  We got to clear the phone lines.  My God.  I think we're going to play a couple songs and we'll be back.  Um...  To clear the lines, let's give out some wrestling tickets, okay?  All right.  Winner receives a pair of tickets to the WWF.  Saturday, April 15th at the Garden.  Before you can buy them.  Plus a WWF t-shirt.  Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10AM through Ticketmaster.  The 10th caller gets the ticks. 
[78:00]
 212-757-1027.  This is NAW.  We'll be back in two.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mint?  No!  It's Orshul!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting pissed!  You sound like a stock-raising mad person.  No!  You're spitting hits!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No! 
[78:30]
 I'm Opie and Anthony.  Look at yourself.  Who's sane and who's insane?  1027-WNEW.  Ah, yes.  Another fine program in progress today.  Yes.  Anthony's falling apart on me.  Ah.  I feel like crap, huh, Ann?  Well, Opie, you know, I don't normally get sick.  That's why it's very strange you never get sick.  Oh, I get this hack.  This hacking cough thing is killing my chest. 
[79:00]
 Uh...  I just want to...  Juke.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up?  How are you?  Hey.  You guys are great. I listen to you guys every day.  Well, we're trying. Thank you, Chris.  Yeah.  I was watching, uh, I told Chris a lot.  I raced right home from work, listened to you guys on the way home.  I was watching right in the left-hand corner.  I could see a big white painting star on, like, a sheet.  Yeah, I know.  Psycho Mark and the Psycho Pass out in full force down there at TRL today.  Oh, so, and then all of a sudden you see the sheet go away,  they pan the camera to the right, and there's two cops standing there. 
[79:30]
 Ha ha ha.  I was like, oh, no way.  Yeah, they kind of got in trouble.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, I figured as much.  Cops told, move along.  Well, thank you, Chris. I'm glad you saw that today.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Dedication now.  All right, bro.  Let's go to James.  James, you're next on NAW.  What's going on?  Yeah, congratulations, gentlemen.  Those guys did a great job.  The other side, on the right side where Madonna was standing, was totally empty.  And then on the left side is a bunch of lunatics jumping around with a big white sign.  Yeah, there had to be, what, about 20 of them or so, huh? 
[80:00]
 It was a nice group.  The whole, the opposite side of the camera angle was totally blank.  There was no one there on that corner, but the other corner is just a bunch of lunatics.  And then empty right here.  They started doing real tight shots to keep them out of the frame.  Yeah, yeah, I noticed that.  The second you saw like a big white and red wow sign go up, that was it.  They just kept them closed.  Cool, James.  Nice job.  I'm glad you saw that.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark.  He's on the warm line that the receptionist feels like giving everyone today. 
[80:30]
 So, Mark, we got a live show!  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Psycho Mark?  Oh, hey, Anthony.  What do you sound, a little sick?  Sounds like full blown AIDS.  Jesus.  Take it easy, man.  Oh my God.  I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.  So what's going on out there?  We've got about 20 guys out here.  And there's a live shot, I guess, across the street here.  They're trying to get in.  Oh, really?  We've got like 20, 25 lunatics just absolutely out of their mind.  Running around here with big wow signs.  And it's just nuts.  As a matter of fact, they stopped TRL. 
[81:00]
 So it's like we're sort of standing around looking for something to do.  Yeah, I know.  You guys got to find some trouble.  Yeah, well, they're looking for a live shot.  But there's nothing going on down here.  But you should have seen all the gasp out here from Madonna.  It was unbelievable.  Well, they had a great crowd out there today.  Yeah, no, it worked out well.  I guess the cops shut us down pretty quick.  Yeah.  You know how they are.  But they're doing their job.  Those guys are good guys.  What's the age bracket of the typical Madonna fan these days?  Like 12.  Really? 
[81:30]
 Well, I'm sure a little bit.  That's a little weird.  It's mostly teeny boppers.  A lot of gay guys?  I didn't see any gay guys.  No?  But there's tons of chicks.  It was unbelievable.  We horrified so many people because these guys are just chanting, you know,  show us your blue nut, you know, and whip them out and scream and all kinds of stuff.  There's a family right in front of us.  They grabbed all their kids and just walked away.  Absolutely horrifying.  They're like, oh wow, look at MTV.  How nice.  And then these guys all started screaming and yelling and they just grabbed their kids 
[82:00]
 and went as fast as they could away from us, you know.  He's not in the house!  It was nuts.  Well, you guys got to continue the...  We're going to get on TV, guys!  We're all going to get arrested.  Well, Mark, the psychopaths are growing as we speak, huh?  It is pretty wild.  It's a lot.  It's breaking down!  Alright.  Oh my God.  Alright, guys.  We'll check back in later.  Alright, Mark.  We'll bring a couple of these lunatics back to the stage.  Thank you.  Want me to give them out the VIP number?  Ah, no.  I think people have it already. 
[82:30]
 Oh, God.  Alright, Mark.  We got to go.  Peace.  Oh, what a lunatics.  You sure you want them back here?  That would give me a headache, Anthony.  I know.  I already have one.  Yes.  Syndication now.  That's a joke.  Every other show that started this week on N.E.W. was already syndicated.  Yeah, I know.  Not us.  No way.  No, that's not too frustrating for your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Well, there's a reason. 
[83:00]
 We're loose cannons, Opie.  Not team players.  Well, we were trying to be team players yesterday and they don't know what to do with us.  But, uh...  Yeah.  But we weren't wanted.  But we did try.  Let's go to Douglas.  Douglas, what's going on, man?  What's up, Opie?  How are you?  Alright.  Check it out.  Go to CBS Studios outside.  There's nobody around to show live shots.  Oh, dude.  That's our company.  So?  We're in enough trouble. 
[83:30]
 Believe me.  Like, we need that.  Green Day's coming around?  When are we getting them in here?  Uh, yeah, we should get Green Day in.  They're good friends.  They had a blast last time we hooked up with them.  We ruined our studio, but...  A lot of fun.  You remember that?  Yeah.  We had Green Day.  Last time we talked to Green Day,  they got...  They were just drinking beers and smoking dope.  And we allowed them to just start breaking CDs.  Yeah.  And they broke our huge clock in the studio. 
[84:00]
 They threw a CD right through the clock face.  Yeah, they like their pot.  That's for sure.  They're gonna be on the Warped Tour this summer, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  We'll hook up with them.  All right.  Uh, enough with the wow on TRL.  I think we covered that.  Yeah.  We appreciate that you guys checked it out.  Moving to California.  How can we lose listeners?  Hate that.  Hey, Jill.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hi, I was just wondering,  how come a guy like Tom Lycus can be syndicated, but you guys can't? 
[84:30]
 I...  I don't know.  That blows my mind.  I don't know.  Listen, what about women with like, um,  you know, you have like, Hummer Tuesday and all that?  Yeah, we're trying to find something for you ladies.  I know what you're gonna say.  We just haven't found anything that, uh, that's catching on yet.  How about like, um,  Finger Friendly Friday?  Finger Friendly?  That sounds pretty good.  How about Finger Paint Friday?  Sure.  All right, we'll figure something out for you ladies eventually.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Jill.  Thanks.  All right. 
[85:00]
 Bye-bye.  We gotta say goodbye to Judy.  She's moving to California.  Judy?  Yes?  Where are you going?  Oh my God.  I didn't think my phone call warranted being put on the air, but...  No, we don't like when people leave, so we gotta figure out why you're going.  I'm going because I've  been living in New York all my life and 27 and I gotta get out.  No, my brother and sister live in LA, so I'm gonna move out there and...  LA, you're gonna become a porn star?  Ah, I don't think so.  What are your dreams when you go out to LA?  What are you gonna do?  I...  Because every girl...  I'm gonna talk to you right, actually. 
[85:30]
 You wanna write?  Yeah.  Like porno movies?  I'm just saying, any...  I could.  Any girl that goes out to LA...  I guess I could.  ...for any career in the arts...  Uh-huh.  ...always ends up somehow in pornography.  I guess I could.  I don't know if I'm that expert, though.  You just need a new start out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I wouldn't move out there unless they were out there, so...  You're not a co-core or anything?  No, no, no, no.  I've never done that.  Uh-uh.  No, but I just love you guys.  I've been listening to you since day one and I'd like to get a t-shirt and just 
[86:00]
 advertise for the show and...  When are you going?  Uh, next month.  Well, come on by and get your t-shirt.  Well, I'm kind of up in the suburbs.  Are you?  It's kind of hard, yeah.  All right, hold on.  Let me see if Ben could send you a shirt off.  Thank you very much.  And good luck in California.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  You have any plans, Opie, for when we go to California on the first?  We're going out there for WrestleMania.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta go to the Comedy Store.  Check out the...  Uh-huh.  Check out the acts.  Yeah.  I'm hoping to see Dice there again. 
[86:30]
 Uh-huh.  Bomb.  And, uh, well, I got a couple of plans.  You do?  I'm gonna rent a car, go down to my old stomping ground of San Juan Capistrano,  right there where the Swallows come back every year.  And I'm, uh, I think I'm gonna make a serious effort to look for Dreamweaver  and see if we can't get her on the air.  Are you serious?  Why not?  Do you know who she is?  Uh, yeah, I think so.  I think I got a couple of people that I might be able to contact that could get me in touch  with the actual Dreamweaver. 
[87:00]
 And you think she's still living in the area?  Uh, I don't know.  I want you to get a...  It's a mystery.  I want you to get a hold of, uh...  Buzz?  Oh, Buzz?  Right?  Girl, that's...  That took your virginity away from you?  Yeah, yeah.  When I was like, uh, 13 or 15 or something.  The girl that your dad set you up with?  Yeah, yeah, Buzz.  I don't know.  She was, uh, like, 22 at the time or something.  Well, that's a while ago now.  So she'll be, uh, yeah.  But she's got to be in the area. 
[87:30]
 I would love to talk to the...  to the girl that, uh, took your virginity.  I'll see if I...  I'm gonna definitely try to get in touch with some of these people, get some numbers at least,  so, uh, we can talk to them.  Right.  You know, dredge up a little of my sordid past.  Because the Buzz story is classic.  You were, what, 13?  13 years old.  Uh, 13th birthday, as a matter of fact.  My father thought, uh,  you know, he's from the mindset that, uh, 13 years old, you gotta get your son laid, you know?  So he leaves.  Leaves the house. 
[88:00]
 And, uh, sends Buzz over.  Did he pay her?  No, Buzz's been a friend of the family's and stuff, you know?  Like, uh, you know, she'd bang anyone.  So, uh,  she's there hanging out.  You know, I've been riding all day, a little dirty.  She goes, oh, why don't you go up to take a shower?  I'm like, oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I'll shower then.  Not thinking anything.  I just run upstairs,  hop in the shower.  I get out of the shower.  Got my little shorts on.  I'm only, you know, 13 years old, Opie. 
[88:30]
 Ready to walk back down the stairs, watch some TV with Buzz.  And I hear from the bedroom,  are you coming in?  Like, hmm, that's weird.  That sounds like Buzz from the bedroom.  I wonder what Buzz is doing in the bedroom.  I just got out of the shower.  I was going to go downstairs, watch some TV.  Buzz, oh, oh, no.  Oh my God.  This is it.  Finally clicked in my head.  This is it.  Walked in.  Just remember seeing Buzz.  She had huge hands. 
[89:00]
 Huge.  She was sitting,  like sitting up in the bed,  propped up by some pillows.  And the sheet was right at her hips.  And her huge boobs were just hanging out in the open.  It's the most remarkable thing I'd seen in my life at that point.  They're just there going, take me, Anthony, take me.  Everything else I had seen up to that point has been in magazine or some cheesy film.  This was like live boobage.  I was just like, oh, oh my goodness.  Oh, here, here we go. 
[89:30]
 This is going to be it.  And yeah, you never forget the first time you see live boobs.  Hopped into bed.  She's like, you know, she starts moving her hands kind of over me and stuff.  Like, oh, okay, that's good.  She moves down further, further.  And then she goes for the grab and she has to go,  uh, why don't you take those shorts off?  Dude, I got into bed and still with the shorts on.  What a tool.  What do you remember for that first experience? 
[90:00]
 I mean, how long did the last?  Just the best thing ever, ever, ever, ever.  It wasn't a two second thing because I think I think I was spanking it in the shower.  I'm not knowing that anything's going to happen.  Yeah, I don't remember really any details.  I mean, it was cool and all, you know, and then I went off to school the next day.  What'd you do right after?  Right after?  Yeah, did she like leave or something?  I smoked a cigarette. 
[90:30]
 Yeah, yeah.  You said you go back to playing with your Hot Wheels or something.  You know what I mean?  Hot Wheels? I wasn't playing with a Hot Wheel.  You know what I'm saying though. At 13, you're still like, well, I think I just went.  I'm heading toward being an adult kind of, but I'm also still a kid.  It must have been a little weird.  I think I went back downstairs and watched some TV.  Yeah.  You know, I think I watched.  Did she quickly leave or was it just that awkward?  No, you know, she kind of hung out on the couch, watched a little TV.  Yeah.  I was like, okay, hey, look at that.  This is great. 
[91:00]
 Watch Bob Bob Black Sheep.  My fingers smell funny.  How'd it go there?  Why? They did.  Marissa, come on, the first time, you're just like a dog at that point.  Come on, smell my finger.  That continued for a while too, like about a year.  Marissa, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  That's a sick little story of just a nothing really.  Oh, it's not even a story. 
[91:30]
 It's just, I don't know.  You guys are just so visual.  I don't know.  Look at that.  Where are you right now?  In my car.  Really?  Yeah.  It sounds like a prank.  What?  Kind of sounds like a prank.  Trust me.  We've heard enough Baba boos today.  No, you want to know something?  Tell it, F. Mackey.  I listened to them in the morning, but that's just, it's getting lame, getting old. 
[92:00]
 I don't know.  There's just something about you guys.  I just, whenever I hear your voices, I just want to touch myself.  All right.  That's pretty good.  We like that.  Wow.  Wow.  What are you wearing now?  Well, I have thigh high stockings on.  I'm wearing a song.  I've got my suit on for work.  Are you a hooker?  No.  I'm closing my eyes so I don't have to look at Anthony while you describe yourself.  All right, go ahead.  I'm far from a hooker. 
[92:30]
 I actually...  I was getting really distracted.  I'm like, I have to close my eyes.  Okay.  What kind of body do you have?  I'm about 5'5".  Yeah.  115.  Oh, yeah.  I'm very athletic.  I run very limber.  I'm a little muscular, but I'm very small-framed.  And you're all turned on as you're in your car on the way home?  I'm sitting here on the highway with one hand between my legs and the other hand holding the phone. 
[93:00]
 Wow.  You must be driving real slow.  Actually, no.  I'm stepping really hard on the accelerator.  Yeah.  Oh.  Now, what part of the Tri-State area are you in?  New Jersey.  Jersey?  Mm-hmm.  I would love to get out of your car so everyone could check you out.  Why?  Are you like...  What are you doing besides that?  You're like...  Well, I'm actually driving home from work.  And you're petting the poodle? 
[93:30]
 I don't have much of a poodle to pet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's pretty close-cropped.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  See, I'm an accountant and I wear very, very sexy underwear.  Under very, very conservative suits.  All right, listen.  Kind of like a little secret I have.  You're killing me.  Not as much as you kill me.  Well, tell me more.  Mm-hmm. 
[94:00]
 All right.  Well, what's she gonna do?  I'll...  She gonna do it right there in the car?  I'm going through my handbook right now, seeing what we can get away with.  Don't crash.  Well, what would you like me to do?  Well, could you give us like a fake orgasm?  Sure.  Of course, it would be fake, I think.  Uh-huh.  Oh... 
[94:30]
 Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  Marissa?  You suck.  I knew she was gonna do that.  What'd she do?  Hung up?  She hung up.  She crashed. 
[95:00]
 Marissa?  You're a C.T.  I hate you.  Ah.  She got us good, man.  She hung up.  These guys want to kill her.  Ah.  Bob, what's going on?  Ah, that chick, man.  You know, I wanted to find, I wanted to play What's in My Pants with this broad on the phone.  Yeah, I was gonna ask her that next, but she hung up.  Oh, my God.  Hey, boy.  She got us good right there, man.  I can't believe it.  Let's review the list of people that have said, I've been here longer than you. 
[95:30]
 Yeah.  Everyone has said that to Ann and I, one time or another.  Let's see, there's Scott Munny, Dave Herman, um, retard receptionist.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, Carol Miller.  Well, yeah, Carol Miller.  Uh, you know, let's see, where are all they?  Well, we were supposed to be fired four months into this job, and miraculously, we're up to a year and nine months today.  A year and nine months today?  Yeah.  My goodness, it's been that long. 
[96:00]
 It just seems like yesterday that you two came on and started terrorizing the city, is it where?  Yeah, well, we're trying.  All right, guys, syndication yesterday, and, uh, I hope to see you, uh, on TV sometime.  All right, Bob, thank you.  Bye.  We gotta get to some of these guys that are really pissed off.  Larry, what's up?  What a biatch.  Oh, man, she set us up bad.  Oh, man, she got you guys good, but you fell into it, you know?  Well, I had a feeling something was going on there.  Couldn't you tell she wasn't on her cell phone? 
[96:30]
 Uh, no.  No?  It was clear as day.  It sounded like her cell phone a little bit.  What was that?  Kind of sounded like her cell phone.  No, come on, she was pulling your third leg.  You know, Larry, it still sounded pretty cool.  I don't care.  Oh, listen, I enjoyed it.  She had a good little, uh, visual mind going there.  Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.  All right.  You knew when she was getting descriptive like that?  Yeah.  You knew it was a hoax.  That's all right.  At that point, you had to jump boat.  All right, Larry, thank you.  Let's go to Jim. 
[97:00]
 Jim, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Good, excellent, man.  Yeah, I got a chubby.  Where'd she go?  She hung up on me.  Come on.  She got me a mid-stroke.  I had a feeling she was up to something,  but it was still pretty cool.  Yeah, these new radio guys I listened to in the morning,  I was listening to a Lycus on the way to work,  and I changed that over.  I heard these guys this morning, the Love Lines?  Uh, Love Lines?  They were pretty funny.  We've had Love Lines on for a while.  Yeah, they had a good one.  Uh, douche bag?  Douche, douche nozzle? 
[97:30]
 Oh.  Huh.  Are you trying to prank us, Jim?  No, not at all.  Come on, guys, I'm a long-time listener.  What's a douche nozzle?  Yeah, I don't care what you're getting at.  Well, that's what they were saying last night.  You know, everybody says douche bag, douche bag.  What about douche nozzle?  Eh, I guess you had to be there.  All right, guys, peace out, syndication yesterday.  All right, Jim, let's go to Rain.  Oh my god.  Rain, what's going on?  Is it me?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Is the medication making my mind work a little weird?  I'm hearing different things that are actually  happening on today's show, Opie. 
[98:00]
 I think you're a step slow.  We're both a step slow today.  I'm not sure.  Is it the callers or is it me?  I don't know.  Rain, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right, man.  Hey, man, you guys are killing me out here with this girl  moaning and groaning, man.  Yeah, Tyler, damn, they almost ran my truck off the road.  Well, let's try to get her back on the line to finish  what she started, all right?  Oh, definitely.  But you know, I'm out here trying to make deliveries.  You know, I'm trying to deliver keggers.  Right.  He delivers keggers.  Yeah, I got that. 
[98:30]
 I'll be delivering keggers signed right here  on my front windshield.  But it's been a long time.  My listener has been going back to hell  for your very first show there.  All right.  Anthony was describing the radio.  So the radio between his, uh, nope.  What?  All right, Rain, Rain, I'm going to cut you off, OK?  Yeah, yeah, I lost it here.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  I think the medication is really affecting me.  Every caller sounds completely frigging retarded.  Amos.  Yeah.  How's Andy?  Huh?  What's up, Amos? 
[99:00]
 Nothing much.  All right.  I would see you guys all the time coming home from work.  Yeah, we appreciate that.  I try to get to that, uh.  We get that by now.  I don't think we need to bring that up with every call.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So what's up, Amos?  Nothing much.  I tried to get to that show you guys had last week.  Yeah.  It was a good.  Too many people were there.  I know.  We apologize.  We're going to get a bigger venue for the next one.  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  What do you have for today?  Um, just wanted to say what's up.  Oh, my god.  All right, Amos. 
[99:30]
 Thank you.  Oh, no.  I don't know if you guys are aware of this,  but we're trying to do a radio show here.  Just want to say what's up.  Hey, what's up?  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  How are you?  I'm good.  I wanted to thank you guys.  Uh, last night, I earned my Red Wings because of you guys.  Oh, how did that happen?  Why, because of us?  Well, the girl that I was with, and she's a big fan of yours.  But, you know, it didn't matter what, you know,  at last night, I'm hanging out or whatever, getting busy,  doing what I got to do.  And I wanted to go, you know, take care of business down there. 
[100:00]
 She didn't want it.  She wasn't having it, so I convinced her that you guys were into it.  You thought it was cool.  It was nice, whatever.  And lo and behold, I earned my Red Wings.  So I just wanted to thank you guys.  Why would you want to do that?  Well, it's a weird, tradish kind of thing.  A lot of guys are into it.  That is, so there's not a lot of guys into that one.  Oh, yeah?  There's a big, big secret society out there.  It's a very secret society. 
[100:30]
 Oh, very secret society.  Looks like you just drank grape juice.  Grape juice? What are you dating?  I like grape juice.  So I just wanted to thank you guys.  All right. Thank you.  Can I get a shirt for that?  No, Joe.  Come on, man.  We don't have any other shirts to give away right now.  Go to eBay and get a Re-Deliver Kegger shirt for 40 bucks just selling on eBay.  Oh, jeez.  Thank you, Joe.  Guys in general are not into the whole Red Wings thing. 
[101:00]
 Getting your Red Wings.  I don't know. Under what circumstance?  All right. Elisa wants to moan for us.  Elisa!  Yes?  That girl kept everyone hanging.  I know.  How are you?  Where are you calling from?  From Jersey.  Yeah? Are you hot?  Yeah.  Real hot?  Very.  Yeah?  Yeah. Are you?  Uh, no. 
[101:30]
 I got the worst haircut.  You can lie in them.  No. So give us a moan.  Give me a moan.  Yeah. Continue where she left off.  Okay.  All right.  How's that? 
[102:00]
 Why are you laughing?  Because I'm high.  You're high?  Ah, now it's making sense.  I think everyone smoked dope today before the show.  Smoke a little.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Can I hear one of you guys, though?  No. It's disgusting. You don't hear guys moan.  Yeah, I do.  I'm gonna moan in pain. 
[102:30]
 All right, guys.  Hello.  I love Scott.  You're so high.  All right.  Okay.  Bye. 
[103:00]
 You guys should smoke weed on the show.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a great radio show.  Stay there.  Or stupidity on the way. 
[103:30]
 957-9639.  And forget about the instant feedback for now.  Oh, no.  Is it working?  Not really. 
[104:00]
 I can't get anything online now.  This pisses me off.  We need to be connected with our listeners.  Well, from time to time, we get folks in the instant feedback.  Thank God it didn't happen before 4.  Oh, wait.  When I'm busy trading at OP.  It's working again.  Mike from down the street.  Chill out, guys, with the chicks.  My goddamn boss just walked by, and I got in trouble because of the freaking moaning.  I'm gonna get written up for listening to a pleasant radio show. 
[104:30]
 Oh, man.  I had to hit the coffee up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're all just like pounding the coffee now.  I was...  Between the cold medication and the callers lulling me to sleep today.  Oh, yeah.  This is just crack in a cup right now.  I'm ready to go.  Well, you don't drink coffee, so when you do, it just puts you over the top.  This is great. 
[105:00]
 Well, Ant, look at our choices of stories on the phone lines.  Oh, my God.  They're all the same.  They're all about Red Wing.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  All right.  I got a pretty horrible one.  I was kind of a...  Not tricked, but I dated this girl like a month ago, and my buddy and I took these two girls  out to teachers at a high school and chaperoned a dance floor and we came back.  I ended up sleeping with one girl. 
[105:30]
 My buddy talked to me about it, and he's like, yeah, man.  He's like, there was a tampon in the bathroom.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, it was horrible.  And I thought about it.  I was like, well, you know, I didn't...  Because you would think you would know, you know?  You would think.  Well, why wouldn't the ladies tell us?  Well, yeah, that's the thing.  She got up and went to the bathroom and came back.  When she came back, she came back with a condom.  So I thought, you know, that's all I thought she went for.  Well, maybe it's a light day or something, you know?  And if you're just going for sex... 
[106:00]
 Even, well, even still, if it was the last day, that's fine, but that's just rude.  Tell a guy, you know?  Just say, hey, listen, don't do that, you know?  Yeah, ladies, help us out, man. Help us out.  It was ridiculous.  Get your head going there, and it's like, am I supposed to tap you on the shoulder?  Oh, I haven't spoken to her since.  Please hold.  I haven't spoken to her.  I'm not that pissed off about it, but it's just one of those things where like, it's a standoff thing.  She wants to call me she can, but that pissed me off to the extent.  Wow, you really got pissed at that, huh?  Oh, it's ridiculous. I mean, that's, I'm sorry, that's rude, because, I don't know. 
[106:30]
 All right, but that's rude.  Well, thank you.  All right, guys, you guys are great.  Well, I know the days.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I got a pretty brutal Red Wing story myself.  Yeah?  About a year or two back, my buddy and I were at a local bar, and we were just getting absolutely smashed off of tequila shots.  And we met up with a couple of these girls, and one thing led to another.  We all ended up splitting up, and I ended up going home with this one chick. 
[107:00]
 And we stopped off on the road on the way home, and we just started going to town.  And we ended up doing a little bit of, I don't know, muff diving.  Yep, yep, yep.  And next thing I know, she just drops me off at my house.  I can't remember anything.  And I wake up the next morning, and I'm looking at my hands.  All right, all right, all right, I know what you're going to say.  Looks like you've been staining the deck outside, right?  Oh, yes.  I'm a little hungover. 
[107:30]
 I've got to go to the bathroom.  I just get done draining the vein.  I've got to wash my hands off, and I look up, and I just go to brush my teeth.  Okay, all right, I think we can figure it out.  That was it.  But here's the kicker.  Yes, dude.  A couple months later, I was dating a new girl.  We're in the same bar.  This chick walks in again, and she comes up to me like, hey, how are you doing?  Now, I just totally pretended like I didn't know who the hell she was.  The girl that I was with at the time turned around and looked at me, and she goes, do you know her? 
[108:00]
 I said, no, not at all.  But if that girlfriend wasn't with me, I think I would have hauled off and knocked her head off right there.  It's just not, I don't understand how these guys can have a secret society.  Yeah, there's a bunch of guys checking in saying, yeah, they're into that.  Yeah, yeah, we believe you.  No way, man.  All right, thank you, Steve.  Take care, guys.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Joe.  Enough with the Red Wing story.  Joe, what's going on?  Thank you.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, a cop is following me now.  What are you following?  I'm following a Channel 2 news van. 
[108:30]
 You're following a news van?  Why?  Yeah, Channel 2, because I'm going to get on live at 6 o'clock at the power plant.  Leave Channel 2 alone.  No, two vans.  I'm getting them.  I got four guys meeting me here in a few minutes.  You got the wow signs?  Yep, I got two wow signs.  All right, Joe, thank you.  All right, and listen, by the way.  If it's a big story, I'm sure, you know, there'll be other news crews out there, Anthony.  Yes, true.  You know, I just don't want to talk about anything in the news today.  There's nothing going on in the news. 
[109:00]
 I mean, the whole strawberry thing is huge.  We've discussed that.  Done.  Know what my latest stance on the whole strawberry thing is, Ant?  What?  I don't think they should have suspended him from baseball.  No.  No, I think as long as he performs on the field, it doesn't really matter what he does  in his private life.  What do you do in your private life?  Yeah, because think about it.  There's some kind of morals clause, I think.  They've got to do something.  Yeah, but I mean, there's a million people out there that do drugs in their job, and no  one has any clue that they're doing it. 
[109:30]
 Yeah, but if they have a clause.  And they're continuing to perform.  If he sucks on the field, then you get rid of him.  Then if he's doing well, they might say, well, it's drug induced.  Well, as long as it's not like the steroids and stuff that enhance your ability to perform  on the field.  I don't know.  He's got some problems.  I think his career is over.  That's it.  He's got problems, but there's a lot of people that are listening to us right now that have  problems, and they still have their jobs, and no one has a clue that they're doing drugs. 
[110:00]
 Who's second, Mark?  What?  Yeah, we saw that.  At the strawberry things played out, we discussed the Diallo thing.  A bunch of cops thanking us for our stance.  Well, I think it's a no brainer.  It's kind of the obvious.  I don't know, man.  The media is killing the cops.  People are still demonstrating.  I don't understand why.  You know?  It's over.  In the words of everybody who is sympathetic to O.J. Simpson, hey, you got to accept the verdict. 
[110:30]
 I just...  That's how it goes down.  You know how I feel about that, Anthony?  Yeah.  I think the cops that were involved.  Yeah.  Should quit.  Why?  Because, man, there's a lot of...  All the other cops are getting crap at this point.  They shouldn't quit?  Why should they have to quit?  They should.  Just go back on the job.  They need a job.  They'll never be able to go back on the job.  I would recognize one of them if I saw him on the street.  They will be harassed so much. 
[111:00]
 It's not going to do anyone any good if they continue doing, you know, street crime especially.  So what are they supposed to do, take an early retirement and...  They should do that?  They should do that?  Open up a restaurant in Florida or something?  They should do that before they get, you know, fired.  There's no way they're going to stay in the force.  All these high profile cases, they end up getting rid of the guys.  I don't know.  For the best interest of the police force.  I think they just ought to stick it out.  What if they just enjoy being cops, you know? 
[111:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know how they would enjoy being cops now.  I would love to talk to a couple of cops about it.  I don't know.  It just sucks that all the other cops are getting, you know, crapped on.  Maybe that's why that one was so nasty to Psycho Mark down by TRL.  Why?  Maybe he's just feeling the pressure.  He's doing his job.  We understand that.  That was pretty funny.  I'm looking at all the other headlines.  He's jumping around here like an a-hole. 
[112:00]
 He calls Mark an a-hole.  Battle of the boy bands.  Who cares?  Six-year-old shoots another six-year-old.  Very sad story.  That's great.  Jesus Christ.  Hunt for the new Kathie Lee.  Who cares?  What?  Oh, Hunt.  Okay.  Sorry.  I get confused.  My ears are clogging up from the cold.  I thought you said something else that wouldn't have made it on the air. 
[112:30]
 Hunt.  Okay.  Another guy shoots up a McDonald's.  I know.  We saw that story too.  That happened today.  I don't go to McDonald's for that reason.  You might get shot up.  I'm sure they'll list all the past shootings in the paper tomorrow.  That's always good.  You need the checklist of all the other shootings when there's a shooting.  Here's the top ten worst shootings in American history.  And they list them down. 
[113:00]
 McDonald's, yeah, that place has had a couple of shootings, hasn't it?  Casey, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  Are you seriously saying that his performance would not change?  What do you mean?  On cocaine?  No, I don't know.  I think there's a lot of people out there that are doing coke and doing their jobs well.  Yeah, but in sports, doesn't that not count?  Doesn't that not count?  What are you trying to say, Casey?  Is it not fair?  I mean, if he was doing steroids or something, he'd be in trouble, right? 
[113:30]
 Yeah.  So same thing.  I could play for the Yankees on cocaine.  All right, sign you up.  Come on, everyone's on coke.  We need a DH.  It's been ten years.  It's been ten years.  We need a DH this year, so give it a try.  It would make a difference, believe me.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  We got a cop on the line.  The strawberry thing, who cares?  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  Yeah.  These guys might get psyched off the job because they're like all stressed out now, so they 
[114:00]
 might give them a disability pension.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because that's what I got, not from psych, from a knee injury.  And I'm just hanging out now going to school.  I'm just trying to get into your heads today there, Danny.  I mean, obviously most of you guys supported the cops through the trial and stuff, and  now a lot of you guys are getting a lot of crap from the protesters and stuff.  I mean, how do you really feel at this point?  Listen, my phone's crapping out.  Can I call you back?  Why, are you a little scared to talk about it? 
[114:30]
 No, I'm not.  My phone's crapping out.  I'll talk about it.  All right, call back.  All right.  We got a couple other people checking in.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Real good.  Listen, those guys shouldn't quit.  They should just stay on, and that's it.  There's no way.  Why should they quit?  Well, honestly, I'm just bringing up something.  I'm trying to get into your heads today to see what you guys are thinking.  That's all.  Well, we supported them all the way, and that's it.  And they shouldn't quit.  They got to support their own families.  What are you going to do?  Start a new career at this point?  I don't know. 
[115:00]
 I don't think so.  Do you think they're going to let them go, though, the NYPD?  I hope not.  I'm hoping not.  On what grounds?  Stapher said that he agreed with the verdict, so maybe he's supporting them, too.  They can't get fired for this on what grounds?  There's no...  I was reading a bunch of articles in the past week.  It happens all the time with these high-profile cases.  They let them go.  Can't fire them?  That's true.  Or they reassign them, or they...  You heard even Stapher...  They move them around.  They pretty much get them off the job, technically. 
[115:30]
 Yeah, Stapher turned around and said right away,  he agreed with the verdict and how it went down.  Right away.  The same day he said it, and that was it.  And I think maybe that's a sign that he's supporting them.  All right.  I'm hoping not.  All right.  I'm just trying to get into your heads,  trying to see what you guys are thinking today.  Take care.  All right, bro.  Let's go to John.  John!  Hey, John, you're next.  What's going on?  What's up, buddy?  This is Sean, not John.  Oh, sorry, Sean.  Yeah, I'm on the job, too.  They're going to fire these guys anyway. 
[116:00]
 They are?  That's what the job does.  Yeah, that's what the job does these days.  Anytime you bring negative light into the department, they fire.  They got squeaky guy.  Not what he did was right, but he got off.  They fired him like three days ago.  That's right.  So these guys are going to...  Yeah, that's the story.  I was trying to remember the detail.  Well, what did they fire him for?  To bring negative light upon the department.  What they did was they said they didn't use their guns,  deadly physical force in an authorized kind of way.  So what is it?  It's like a catch-all.  It's like anything else.  Anytime they want to get rid of you, they can find a reason to get rid of you. 
[116:30]
 And as far as these guys haven't quit before, then, I don't know if I agree with that because,  you know, you deal with all this nonsense every day.  There's nothing you can do about it.  If Anthony says something stupid on the radio tomorrow and it brings heat down on you and  Anthony, what, are you going to quit, Opie?  Right.  No, I'm...  You can quit, you know?  No, John, that happens on a daily basis, and I hope he's still here.  John!  Anthony, you know what this is?  What?  Anthony, you know what Red Devil's, brother?  Oh, my God, Sean, yeah.  What's going on, kid?  This guy used to play paintball with.  Yeah, how long are you on the job now?  Almost 10 years.  Good.  Wow.  Boy, that went fast.  Time flies, right?  I haven't seen you since almost since Nashville.  That was a trip and a half. 
[117:00]
 Yeah, we went to the air gun games, like paintball games, down in Nashville.  We were the proud team representing New York.  What happened, Sean?  We got our asses handed to us.  Oh, my God, we almost got locked up a couple times.  We went out, and we were all drunk until like 4 in the morning.  We go back to the hotel room, and then they wake us up at 6 to play paintball against this team from Tennessee.  Yee-haw!  We walked out there.  They handed us our asses. 
[117:30]
 Go back home, Yankee!  Yee-hoo!  I remember being behind a rock, and they're closing in on us.  There's no way we're going to get out of this.  So I go, I'm going to just stand up and run.  I figure I'll be able to maybe evade some of the shots.  The second I peeked up from behind the rock, I just got pummeled.  Done.  Like, okay, I'm done.  We got to have a reunion game one of these days.  We'll take the Red Devil down.  Opie will get his own team, and we'll take him to school. 
[118:00]
 Cool, man.  Not a bad idea for the spring.  Thank you, John.  Say hi to Jim, Sean.  Yeah, you got to let him.  All right, man.  You have the name wrong, it's John.  Suzanne.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, Suzanne.  I know you guys complain all the time that you don't have enough female chorus, but here's  one, and I'm a cop.  Are you sure you're a female?  I swear to God, I know I get that all the time.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  Okay.  I'm calling out the Dior thing.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Those four guys, they've got families, they've got kids. 
[118:30]
 It's a shame that people think that what they did is smoking.  That's right, Tommy.  That's absolutely right.  What happened to that voice of yours?  Nothing, smoking.  Smoking.  Smoking.  How much do you smoke?  What do you smoke?  Lincoln Logs.  No, not Lincoln Logs.  Are you still smoking?  Yeah, I am.  Did you ever sound like a chick?  Yes, I do.  My husband thinks I do.  Thank you.  Repeat after me.  Yes.  Come here, big boy.  No.  Just say it. 
[119:00]
 No, I just wanted to call you guys.  Come on.  I want to hear what it sounds like.  No.  I just wanted to say hello, and thank you guys for supporting us.  We need as much as we can get.  We're trying.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  See you.  See you.  Bye-bye.  Sexy, raspy voice.  Just like Demi Moore.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Not for nothing, that Sean guy felt like a moron.  Doesn't know what he's talking about.  John, actually.  Yeah, well, negative life in the police department.  Guys were in a shootout.  They're scared for their lives.  They shot somebody.  It was an accident.  Unfortunately, they shot a lot, but it was an accident.  That had nothing to do with the squeegee, you know?  Well, you cursed.  Half of that didn't make sense.  I didn't curse. 
[119:30]
 Wacko.  I said F-ing.  F-ing.  Oh, did I?  Wacko.  Wacko.  Wacko.  I said F-ing.  F-ing.  Oh, did I?  We heard you.  Oh, I did.  Sorry.  But these guys, they should keep their job.  Unfortunately, they're going to be under a lot of pressure.  Maybe they'll get an inside job where the police department will give them a favor and  give them psych them out with three quarters and retire them early.  Okay.  God damn.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Later.  All right. 
[120:00]
 We'll take one more and then we got to take a break.  Joe.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Good.  You're the last one on this subject.  What's up?  I'm going to talk to the Suffolk cops.  Don't have him go away.  No, I live out here in Suffolk, but I'm a New York City cop.  All right.  These guys are not facing any departmental charges.  There will be a firearms review board, however.  Oh, yeah?  I believe they'll pass that firearms review board.  Yeah.  They definitely should keep their jobs if they want to.  I'm not sure they're going to be able to because in the end, when it was over, the guy, in 
[120:30]
 fact, did not have a gun on him.  There's been many confrontations I've been in where I damn near cap people.  And as it turned out, they were imitation fake guns or things that I thought were guns  were about to shoot somebody.  And, you know, after I thought it over, I was like, Jesus, what I would have felt like  afterwards would have been a good shooting like this was, but, you know, what it just  would have put me to go.  Yeah.  You know, and these guys, they may not want to do the job, but I think they should keep  the job if they want to.  Okay, Joe.  Thank you.  You're welcome. 
[121:00]
 I was wrong.  I think the cops would think they should go away just to relieve the pressure.  No, that's why I wanted to talk to some of the cops.  Johnny, you're a Suffolk cop.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  All right, Suffolk.  I think these guys are cops.  Really?  Yeah.  They're not going to be able to do their job.  Oh, yeah?  How can they do their job anymore?  What precinct you're at?  The third precinct.  The third?  Yeah.  Was that like Bayshore?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys are a blast.  Well, yeah.  I love Suffolk cops.  Why is that?  Do they make the most money? 
[121:30]
 Yeah, you make the most money.  I mean, my whole adolescence was spent with one of your cars behind my car.  Every time I went out, I was getting, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right.  You guys come out of nowhere in Suffolk, just pulled over.  Guys used to rouse us all the time, man.  You can't just drive around in Suffolk County.  Like New York, New York City, you're walking down the street, you're driving.  They don't give you a second look.  Suffolk County, if you are on the road after like midnight, they will look at your car, 
[122:00]
 look into your car, give you a look as you pass them by, and goddamn, I don't know what kind of night vision goggles you're looking at for that expiration date on the inspections thing.  But at night, on a dark road, you could spot that stuff.  And you guys make us so paranoid.  You get behind us and we're like, oh, and you're just trying to keep the car straight.  You're probably not even buzzed.  Yeah.  But sure enough, you're so freaked out.  I'm weaving because I'm spending half of the time. 
[122:30]
 I should be looking at the road, looking at the rear view.  Yeah.  Do you notice we all have those glasses on too?  Yeah, the glasses, you come out of the car.  Oh, you guys are a little, you guys are a little, I don't know.  No, no, the New York City cops, they're a little more careful than you guys when they come up to the car.  Oh, they got me.  Well, they should be.  Like they never walk right up to the door that's usually behind you.  Well, that's it.  You notice when you when they walk up, you'll see they have their hand right on their belt. 
[123:00]
 Yeah.  You guys, it's like, hey, how you doing?  But anyway, these guys, they got, you know.  Barney Fife, Jesus.  And it's brave to talk about you guys now because he doesn't drive in Suffolk County anymore.  I haven't been in Suffolk County in a while.  I need to bring that point up on the radio shows and talking about you guys.  I still drive all over Suffolk.  You're Suffolk cops.  And I enjoy Suffolk County and I support the Suffolk County cops.  You're Suffolk cops.  Suffolk cops.  What do they got you driving in these days?  Caddy Seville's?  What are you driving there?  The luxury cars. 
[123:30]
 What do they got?  Lexus is now on the floor.  You guys are making my money hand over fist.  The Suffolk cops.  Poor city cops are trying to scrape a shoe horn into Giuliani's pocket to get some change out of it.  And meanwhile, like, you know, the Suffolk cops are going on caviar runs.  All right.  I'll let you guys run.  Duncan Donnett's a serving caviar.  Johnny, Johnny, remember this was all Anthony.  You guys got it right.  And he still drives an SUV.  Come on.  I'm kidding, man.  Who's driving the yellow car? 
[124:00]
 That's right.  To be honest, Rick, go get him.  I'll keep my eyes out for that.  He's probably got a transvestite in the passenger seat.  I'll look at the slip and slide for that.  I think there's only one that drives in Suffolk County and it's Rick.  He's in the exit 52 parking ride.  Exit 52 slip and slide.  The slip and slide.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you, Johnny.  They used to suck because I would have to go to the exit 52 parking ride with my toolbox and stuff to meet the guy that I was going to be doing the job with that day, you know, when I was a helper doing tin knocking. 
[124:30]
 So I go there, park the car, you wait for the truck and then you get out and you try to make a point of letting everyone there know that you're there to work.  Like I make sure my toolbox is out.  I'm pretty much I'm holding a hammer and a drill in my hand.  And for them, it's like sexual device anyway.  Hey, I can use that.  Makeda goes on in that parking right.  I never knew so many people were going to work at two in the morning when you're. 
[125:00]
 Rick's checking it.  Oh, Jesus.  Rick's on jury duty this week.  Hey, Rick.  Yo, where are you?  I'm at exit 52 at the parking right.  At the parking right.  Dick.  In your miata.  How was jury duty today?  Ah, I can't really talk about the case, guys.  Oh, look at you.  Shut up.  Tell us what happened.  Let's see.  Got there at nine o'clock.  Took about three naps, read two newspapers, took one huge dump. 
[125:30]
 And then finally got carted off to another building.  And ever since then, we sat and they've been like going through.  It's called the Wadi here.  What is that?  The Wadi here.  Yeah.  Where they start screening out who they want on the jury.  Oh, yeah.  You know, picking people, finding out if they got problems with it or seeing who's been arrested or.  So did you play your Latin baseball song for them?  Not yet. I haven't been called up into the jury box yet. 
[126:00]
 So how are you going to get out of jury duty?  I don't know.  Maybe be yourself.  Believe me.  Huh?  Just be yourself.  Be yourself.  They'll throw you right out.  Yeah, I figured that.  I'm just playing the baseball song.  Yeah. So what?  You got to go back tomorrow?  I got to go back tomorrow.  Oh, man.  Sucks.  So you just wasted a whole day doing absolutely nothing.  Oh, yeah.  They pretty much kept us there.  Gave us two hours for lunch.  Who the hell needs two hours for lunch?  And then we sat around while they questioned everybody. 
[126:30]
 Can you just say, you know, I'm the producer of a really lame radio show and I have to be there every day?  They haven't gotten to me yet.  That's the problem.  So you just go there and sit?  I just go there and sit and watch everybody else try and get out of it.  That would drive me nuts.  Actually, it's kind of funny because I got a couple of good ideas for people who want to get out of jury duty.  If you're Asian, just pretend you don't speak English.  Uh-huh. Oh, is that what's going on?  One lady, she's like, all the broken English.  It's like, okay, you're dismissed.  Rick, grow like a Clark Gable mustache and they'll let you off too. 
[127:00]
 Yeah, wear like a bandana on your head.  You think if I come in wearing colors?  Yeah, they'll let you go.  All right, cool.  You don't know what case it's for or anything?  Yeah, it's like a burglary, robbery, armed.  Well, that could be kind of fun.  Yeah, it's kind of cool actually.  Find out the color of the person and then get him or her guilty.  I already know.  No, I'm kidding.  I think we all know.  Oh my God.  That's just wrong.  Oh my goodness.  What? I didn't say what color ass is. 
[127:30]
 Neither did I.  Why are you saying it's so wrong?  Because no matter what color it is, you shouldn't judge based on somebody's color, whether they're guilty or not.  What is it? Breaking and entering?  Let's see, robbery, burglary, armed.  Robbery is confronting somebody.  Yeah, the whole thing.  All right, everyone in their car right now, what color you think?  All right.  What is this, from Manhattan?  No, it's on Long Island.  What town was it in? 
[128:00]
 I don't know if I can say.  It's a city.  It's in Nassau County.  I don't know where the whole thing took place, but I know it's like Nassau.  All right, I've changed my opinion now.  Yeah?  Yeah. Oh yeah.  Okay. Rick, it's one of your kind.  Oh my God.  Look at that.  They might just throw you right out based on that.  Wow.  Am I right or wrong?  No, you're wrong.  Damn.  Oh, you know what the defendant, who it is? 
[128:30]
 Oh yeah.  And what the race is?  We get to sit there and look at him and everything.  Oh, you do?  God damn, that's pretty funny.  You get to look at him.  Hey, I might be judging you.  What's up, dude?  All right, Rick.  I just want to make sure he doesn't get a book.  Now, without giving out his race or anything, I'll just have to ask a couple of simple questions.  Asians don't break an entry. 
[129:00]
 That's not breaking an entry.  A BNA can't be an Asian guy.  When was the last time you read a story about an Asian guy breaking an entry?  It's up and coming.  Ching Wu was arrested, blinking and entering.  Blinking?  Okay.  All right, what questions can we ask him so that it really isn't answering,  but we kind of know the race of the defendant?  Let's see.  Okay, would the defendant be more comfortable driving a 72 Caddy or an SUV? 
[129:30]
 Both.  Wait a minute.  Both or both?  Both.  Both.  All right.  Okay.  Would the defendant be more apt to be online at a Broadway show or the unemployment office? 
[130:00]
 Good question.  I'd have to go unemployment.  Okay.  That's a white guy.  It's a white guy.  Yeah.  Because it's either a white guy or a Hispanic.  Not a Hispanic guy.  You're already wrong on that.  Well, I know, so it's got to be a white guy.  When he robbed the people, would he ask them for their money or ask them for their money? 
[130:30]
 You actually sound like one of the jurors today.  One of the guys who was being asked questions if you should be on the jury or not.  Well?  Let's see.  That's a pretty simple question there, right?  Yeah, it is.  All right.  He would ask them.  Okay.  I think we have an answer.  All right.  That's it.  End of questioning.  You may step down.  Okay, Rick. 
[131:00]
 Yeah, basically what Psycho Mark just said.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, Rick, have fun tomorrow at jury duty.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be a blast.  Have fun being actually thrown into jail for some type of contempt for even talking to  you.  You asked.  No.  Yeah.  You gave away a little too much info there, pal.  No, I didn't.  Sure you didn't.  I didn't tell you anything.  What did they tell you when you left?  Not to discuss the case with anyone. 
[131:30]
 Especially two million people.  All right, Rick.  We got to let you go.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Be soon to be incarcerated, Rick.  OP and Anthony, those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer, and I've been up since like, oh, I don't know, yesterday. 
[132:00]
 And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is OP and Anthony.  I'm talking in 1027, and EW.  Hammer, I'm going to pee.  Goddamn Brewer, man.  I miss Brewer.  He's a rip.  That voice cracks me up every time.  Remember yesterday we had a kid that needed some questions to ask his sex ed teacher? 
[132:30]
 Yes.  I was checking in to let us know how cool his class was today.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Okay, you're never going to believe what happened.  I'll just get right into the story.  She's about to write something on the board, and before she turns around to start writing,  she says, okay, I'll take some questions.  I raise my hand, and she goes, Scott, turns around, starts writing.  I take a second to ask the question, then I finally go, yeah, does a vagina have teeth?  She stops right in the middle of a word, turns around, and looks at me like I have a dildo 
[133:00]
 going out of the side of my head.  It was so funny.  Did the class laugh at you?  Well, all the girls in my class started laughing.  They were giggling, but my friend that listens to you, he was laughing like crazy.  He listened to you guys, and he heard me on the radio the other day.  See, this has been a dream of mine.  We can still affect school classes years after being in school, Opie.  We can still disrupt the classroom.  Now, did the teacher answer your question, Scott?  No, my English teacher was in the room, and she was talking to me.  She said, hey, I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school. 
[133:30]
 I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school. 
[134:00]
 I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  I'm going to go to school.  And I was hoping you'd mention it on there, but I didn't hear it.  I'll try to send it to you tomorrow.  I still have it.  Alright, Scott, thank you.  Right.  There you go, Scott.  Junior high school kid sending us porn.  That's great.  Al, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Figured I'd weigh in real quick with the D'Alla thing.  And Al, it's pretty funny you just played the Jim Brewer bit.  Unless I'm misinformed, I think Jim's brother is a cop, and I work with him at my precinct.  Okay. 
[134:30]
 Small world.  Yeah, the whole public perception and the way they treat us, it probably led to the  most unprofessional moment of my career yesterday.  Walking to footposts, you know, to minding my own business.  Some guy is totally parked somewhere that is completely f'ing up traffic beyond all  capacity.  I bang the guy's helmet, and a guy's walking by.  It's not even his car.  And he goes, well, I bet you don't write summons in your own name, but I guess this is a big  game to you.  I'm like, well, guy, I'm just doing my job.  This guy's in a bad spot.  He gets BS, blah, blah, blah.  You're all a bunch of a-holes.  I'm thinking, I got to take this. 
[135:00]
 I have to watch the news and the protesters screaming in the cop's face.  I go, all right, listen.  I go, you know, I'm just doing my job, man.  Don't get on my case like that.  He goes, F you.  F you.  I'm in uniform.  I'm just on a street corner.  He goes, F you.  I go, F you.  Give it right back to him.  Now, the little voice in the back is like, dude, calm down.  Dude, calm down.  Calm down.  Guy goes, you know what?  I'm going to kick your ass.  He says that to you?  He says that to me.  Did you tune him up?  Well, here it is.  I'm like a group of like 50 people gathering around me. 
[135:30]
 I take my hat off.  I mean, literally, I wasn't even thinking clearly.  I get mad just telling the story.  Dude, I was pissed for like three hours yesterday after this.  I take my hat off.  I take my shades off.  I sit on a paper.  I'm like, here's your chance, guy.  Here's your chance to make a statement.  I go, and I start yelling.  I'm like, you just started to kick my ass in front of 50 people.  Now, come on.  He goes, you still got a gun, don't you?  I slide the magazine out of my gun.  It's sticking out of my pocket.  Turn my radio off.  I go, there you go.  I ain't calling for help.  I ain't going to shoot you.  Here's your big chance, man.  You talk the talk, now walk the walk. 
[136:00]
 Now the guy standing there dumbfounded because he basically, I think he expected me to turn  around and walk away.  He stands there for like 15, 20 seconds.  I think if you guys remember what my appearance was from the end of the Hooties drink fest,  I was that big guy with the shaved head that hung out with you guys.  Yeah.  Who's going to mess with you?  Well, this guy, he looked mid-40s, and I guess he was trying to make his big social  statement or something.  But he stands there not saying anything.  I go, that's what I thought, you effing coward.  I mean totally not professional.  Yeah, that's kind of against the policy, I think. 
[136:30]
 I'm glad you stood your ground, man.  Yeah, well he goes, well, I'll see you next time.  I go, you come see me when you grow some hair on your genitalia.  The whole crowd starts going, oh, jeez, man.  I'll slap it in like thighs and stuff.  I just walked off and the guy was yelling, man.  But I was like, growing up, I'd be definitely afraid to say anything like that to a cop.  Yeah.  This guy just jumped right on my case, man.  Big F you.  I'll kick your ass right in my face.  All right, Al.  Guys, have a great day.  You too. 
[137:00]
 See you.  Good story.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on NAW.  Hey, what's up, Al?  What's up, Anthony?  Hey, I got a question for Opie.  I mean, you guys are really great support.  You know, it's cops, great job.  But when Opie said that, the four cops should quit.  Well, I was just trying to start a conversation because I really wanted to know what you guys  were thinking.  I guess I didn't really explain it the right way.  It seems to me that logically, it seems that that might be best for you guys. 
[137:30]
 And that's why I suggested it, that's all.  No, you know, everyone's got their opinions.  I mean, you got yours.  And I'll be the first to admit that I'm wrong because all the cops that we talked to, not  one of them said that they should step down.  So I was definitely wrong.  But I was just trying to start a conversation about it.  I agree, man.  It's like the guy was saying before, like with the grease man, like he says stupid, you  know, crap all the time.  Why don't I do that?  You know, you don't take that to heart yourself.  You know, you just go on. 
[138:00]
 Also, I got another question a couple of days ago.  You guys talk about the Flyers and the Islander game and no support or whatever.  Yeah, it pisses me off.  We were at that game.  We owned about 20 cops.  We went to that game.  It was great, man.  There was a whole bunch of Philly cops behind us.  There was a whole lot of chances of not guilty were going on at the game.  Wow.  Pretty good.  Cool, Joe.  There was an eight year old kid too.  Had a nice good wow sign going over there.  Yeah, I hear there's a lot of wow signs at the Islander games.  Yeah, the wow. 
[138:30]
 Well, thank you, Joe.  All right, take care guys.  All right, peace.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, you're next on NDW.  Hey, how you doing guys?  Good.  Thanks for supporting us.  But however, you know how you look at it.  Are you guys working today?  Listen, what happened was a real tragedy.  Those poor guys with the guy to go through, their lives are never going to be the same  again.  I mean, it's a sick thing.  You got to figure having a family and then just, you know, going through all that and  putting your family through that.  And of course, the news is going to see if I was one of the cops and he's going into 
[139:00]
 his house and he's got his daughter right next to him.  They take a picture.  Yeah, they got, you know, that's wrong.  You know, the papers are not right.  Hate us.  And it's just terrible.  You know, you got guys going out there cleaning up societies, pills and here these guys, you  know, we're looking for a guy who had a rape pattern of rapes.  And not only that, he killed a couple of people and there's this guy who looked like him.  They're just going to question him.  Yeah, we know the story.  What happened?  What happened?  But it's just terrible. 
[139:30]
 You know, you want us to go out there, do a job, you know, unfortunately there are going  to be casualties sometimes.  You know, what happened?  It's just real terrible.  But the bottom line is, you want the cops out there doing their job.  I would love to see the outrage the next time God forbid, you know, the police are going  I would love to see the outrage the next time God forbid, one of you guys goes down.  You don't see the same outrage.  It drives me nuts.  What happened two weeks ago in Crown Heights, a 7-1 precinct, a lady was getting robbed  at gunpoint in a hallway of a home and she was fighting off the attacker and it spilled 
[140:00]
 out into the street.  He took off with her handbag.  He had a 9-millimeter handgun.  He ran down two blocks.  She ran after the guy.  What happened was that the officers had an arrest in the car.  They were coming from wherever the arrest was.  They were going to the station house to process the arrest.  What happened was that the lady spotted the van and she was pointing to the officers and  she told them what happened.  They gave chase.  They pulled up in a van behind the perpetrator.  The perpetrator spun around with a 9-millimeter to fire at them but the gun locked up. 
[140:30]
 What happened was the guy dropped the gun and he ran and they caught up to him.  They didn't know the gun was going to lock up.  They knocked the car and that had happened.  The van was in the chamber and it locked up.  You don't hear that.  That's not front page news.  That got like page six of the news.  These guys showed a lot of restraint.  The officers who actually did that, the officers in the back of their mind.  They said, we were thinking about that and we were just glad. 
[141:00]
 The people were just screaming in the street, the lady who was robbed, don't shoot, don't  shoot, man, what are you throwing?  It's going to get somebody hurt.  It's going to get somebody killed.  You don't get to see any marches and protests about them.  How very jealous.  They're also sick and drunk.  Right.  There you go, Frank.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  What happened?  I was playing a little ping pong.  It must be the cold medicine.  It's crazy, man.  All right, we got to get the other side on the air. 
[141:30]
 We don't have to but...  Vanjie!  Yes, how you doing, guys?  All right, Vanjie, what's up?  Listen, like you guys, well, maybe this is not your thing.  It's just everything.  You know, they're not talking about the case that's in Burrow Park because those four officers  were also acquitted.  But nobody's even talking about that.  You know, with that guy with the wielding the hammer that got shot.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah.  And he was...they were all acquitted.  Uh-huh.  So why don't you talk about that?  Well, I didn't even realize they got acquitted and how long ago was that now? 
[142:00]
 It was just last summer, you know, just like the other last year.  Right.  Well, I think the cops in that shooting should have been acquitted as well.  Uh-huh.  A lunatic with a hammer, you don't know what the hell he's going to do.  That's true, that's true.  I mean, you don't see that?  I don't see what?  You know, as far as like what...  What, Vanjie, what did you think should happen to the cops in that case?  Maybe reckless engagement like...  No way, man!  You got a lunatic with a hammer. 
[142:30]
 You don't know what the guy's going to do, okay?  What if he started crushing the skull of a baby right there?  Uh-huh.  There was a bunch of people around.  Yeah.  The cops have to make a decision at that point.  Oh, but...  He had a weapon and it was obvious he was going to use it.  So nobody could have jumped him from behind, huh?  That's not the way they do it.  Oh, I see, okay.  I'm sure that, you know, they try sometimes, but you know, they have to make judgment calls.  Oh.  You got a guy running around with a hammer, threatening to, you know, use it. 
[143:00]
 What are you going to do?  Yeah.  What if it was your kid there and all of a sudden the guy starts...  I don't have kids.  Well, I'm just saying.  Let's think about it.  It's someone you know and this guy's attacking someone you love with the hammer.  Well, I just feel bad anybody, whatever happens, has to be shot and killed like that.  Well, it's always a...  Maybe wounded.  It's always a tragedy, but in that case, I honestly think the officers should have been acquitted.  Oh, okay.  That's my god's honest opinion. 
[143:30]
 I don't know what to tell you.  Okay, but to change the subject, when are you guys going to come to Harlem and do a broadcast?  Well, we got to like calm everyone down before we can try to...  Oh, yeah.  Before we try to do that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm just having a tough time getting to the subway these days.  And it's only a couple blocks.  You know, nothing happened up here.  Some old animal novel called me last week and said, oh, I'm trying to get uptown and  they got cops all over it. 
[144:00]
 It's terrible.  You know, I went outside and it was just business as usual.  White folk walking around, black folks walking around, everybody going about their business.  Has everyone sat up there still?  Is there like a sense of outrage?  Not tonight.  Well, see, that happened in the Bronx.  Yeah, I know that.  The problem's a whole different animal, but...  But see, nothing, you know, I mean, I live right here in the heart of everything and  nothing's happening.  Right.  So I just want to know when you guys...  Angie, do you like the cops?  Yeah, they're okay. 
[144:30]
 They never did anything to me.  Well, yeah, I like them.  Yeah.  They've been helpful.  All right.  I mean, just because I'm black, I wouldn't like them.  No, I'm just asking because you're in Harlem and, you know, no, it's not a black, white  thing.  Oh, no, let me know.  Okay, there's people just like I am.  You know, a lot of people ask why do you guys support the cops so much?  Let me tell you why.  Like, Aunt and I were born and raised, you know, in the Tri-State area.  I went away for a while to do radio. 
[145:00]
 Went away?  Oh, I thought you meant the big town.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  And before I left, I mean, I swear to you, it was...  The city was a real dangerous place.  Oh.  And when I came back, it was a completely different city.  Mm-hmm.  Completely different.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  And it's not just the mayor.  You know, the cops are out there.  The cops are out there, don't they?  The cops are out there, and I just feel so much safer walking around.  Safer from who?  I mean, like, who's going to buy...  Oh, my God, being one of the bad guys.  Being a white kid from Long Island, when we used to take our trips to the city, this was 
[145:30]
 a dangerous place.  I swear to you.  You didn't want to end up in the bad part of town, and the bad part of town wasn't,  you know, a place where nice people were walking around.  You knew where the bad parts of town were.  Oh.  There was a lot of bad parts of town.  There were a lot more of them.  But see, listen, I've walked in white neighborhoods, and I've never felt threatened.  Mm.  It's different.  You know?  I mean, see, the thing is that if you walk around...  See, it's different.  There's no...  If you walk around...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[146:00]
 Vengeance is...  That's a silly analogy.  Do you honestly think black people feel threatened in general in white neighborhoods?  But see, the thing is...  I'm just asking because I have no clue.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's the occasional racially motivated crime against black people that are in the  white neighborhoods.  We've heard them before on the news.  Yeah.  It's happened.  But I don't know.  Let's say, take a black person and let him walk around maybe, I don't know, a great neck.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  So I would put a great neck and walk around. 
[146:30]
 Right.  But then take a white guy and let's put, I don't know, a bedside...  A red hook.  That's pretty rough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's good.  I would even walk around red hooks.  Now, it's two in the morning, maybe three in the morning.  You're walking around.  Who is in more danger?  Well, I think, well, walking around two in the morning by yourself, you know, anybody  could be in danger.  Right.  Who would be in more danger?  I don't know.  I'd have to go with the white person. 
[147:00]
 Well, I think, you know what?  I would say a female would be in more danger, whether she was black or white.  I wouldn't even say a man, you know?  Right.  I'm just saying some areas are a little more dangerous than others.  That's known.  That's true.  There's more crime in certain areas than other areas.  That's what happens.  Vanjie, a cop wants to talk to you.  Okay.  Hey, Joe?  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Wait, wait, wait, Joe.  Before you start, believe it or not, Vanjie's kind of a friend of the show, so try to keep  it on the up and up. 
[147:30]
 I know you want to like strangle her, but Joe, go ahead.  Talk to Vanjie.  Yeah, but how do you explain that a hammer is in the weapon?  If a guy's...  I didn't say a hammer was in the weapon.  No, no, no, Joe.  I said...  If a guy has a weapon up in the air, he's going to hit somebody with it.  You expect a cop to jump 10 feet and then tackle him?  Well, that's just some religion, Joe.  Or just point the gun at him and shoot him?  I mean, what's going to save the person's life?  Trying to...  Oh, well, you know, I couldn't jump 10 feet and I'm sorry, well, now you're dead, but  if I would have shot you, I know I would have stopped you from killing somebody. 
[148:00]
 I mean...  I wouldn't have shot him in the knee or something.  They don't train us to do that.  You are supposed to shoot to kill.  That's it.  If you're going to shoot to stop somebody from taking someone's life or the life of  another, you know, they're trained to shoot to kill.  That's what we're trained for.  The big target.  Oh, I just thought that...  Center of mass, and that's it.  Someone could have circled behind him and tackled him or something.  It's not a movie.  You know, they don't circle behind... 
[148:30]
 Yeah, you flank, do a flanking maneuver.  No, you put your gun out, you shoot him.  It takes a lot for a cop to pull out a gun, first of all.  No, I know.  That's when you kill somebody, so it's traumatic.  If they're going to pull out the gun, they can't fool around.  I know.  They have made a serious decision.  That's probably going to affect them for the rest of their lives as well.  Absolutely.  Okay, Joe, I don't have a problem with you.  I just was very offended that you thought that we could have done something else.  Please, Joe, don't be offended.  I wasn't even there, you know, and I'm just going by what, you know, everyone else heard 
[149:00]
 in the public of what happened in the thing.  The guy had his arm up in the air with the hammer and he was about to strike somebody.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, and from that scenario, I would have shot the guy.  Okay, Joe, where are you a cop?  In New Jersey.  Where?  In New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Yeah.  Okay, well, you weren't there either, were you?  No, I just said that.  We're all going on what we know from reading about it, Vangie.  Oh.  Just like you.  You weren't there either, right?  No.  You made your decision on what you read and so am I, and so is Joe, obviously. 
[149:30]
 Well, I mean, you know.  The guy was a raging lunatic, you know, when that all went down.  Yeah.  God knows what he was going to do with the hammer.  Oh.  And I'm sure the cops said a few times, you know, put the damn hammer down.  Yeah, they did say that.  But what do you think he's going to do, sell it like soar or something?  I don't know.  I just thought you should rethink things before you say something like that.  Vangie, in all honesty, I think you could kill a person with a hammer pretty easily.  I'm sure you could.  Yeah.  You know? 
[150:00]
 But I mean, you can kill a person with a gun faster.  Yeah, but it's not about that.  You know, let the guy loose, you know, he's a stark, raving lunatic, loose on the streets with a hammer.  Someone's going to get hurt.  That's true.  The whole thing, that's the only thing.  And it doesn't take, you know, much to kill somebody.  One strike could pretty much do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you hit him in the right place.  If you hit him right in the top of the head or anywhere in the head, you're going to kill him.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Well, I'm sorry if I offended you, okay?  All right, Joe. 
[150:30]
 Very disgusting.  That's all right, Vanjie, you offend someone.  I mean, you know, that's what you believe and that's fine.  That's why we're trying to discuss this.  No, I mean, I'm just saying that it's unfortunate that, I don't know, these kind of crazy things happen.  And I think that some people sort of overreact a little bit.  Well, you know, there's fear, there's a little panic, you know.  There's tragedies that take place, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, anyway, like I said, wait until the trouble dies down and come and do a broadcast here at Harlem. 
[151:00]
 We're still into doing a broadcast in Harlem.  Oh, great.  All right.  We did promise to do one first, though, on Venus.  We have to do that first.  Oh, okay.  But right after the Venus broadcast, we're coming on.  And then Mars?  And then Mars and then us.  Oh, yeah, Mars too, yeah.  I think we're about 20 years away from, you know, being able to get to Venus.  Yes.  Well, how about just someplace in Manhattan?  Somewhere in the year 2021.  Yeah, we'll be in Harlem.  Right after the temperature in hell reaches 32 degrees. 
[151:30]
 Right.  Please, what's just someplace in Manhattan that I can get to?  They don't have to take their long island railroads and stuff.  Just anyplace down the village or something.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Vanjie.  Okay, you guys take care.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Okay, we got to take a break.  Anthony?  All righty.  Want to thank Vanjie for checking in?  Yes, it's always good to get all sides of a story.  You guys have deteriorated to beyond belief right now.  The Opium Anthony Show. 
[152:00]
 Thank you.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, it's Joe Piscopo on 1027.  As the chairman of the board might say, Opium Anthony, you are two groovy cats.  I love you, baby.  You knocked me out.  Wonderful.  Marvelous.  Beautiful.  Cuckoo.  Wonderful.  He wouldn't say that because he's dead.  Frank Sinatra is dead.  1027 WNEW, it's the old A show.  Let's go to Tracy.  Tracy, you're next on NEW. 
[152:30]
 Hey, over there.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  Let me tell you.  As much as I love you guys, you discriminate against the sexes.  How?  In what way?  A couple of days ago, I don't remember what day, but a girl, 16, called about a lesbian  thing.  Yeah.  You talk to all the 12-year-old boys in the world.  You guys talk to too many little boys.  Let's see.  Why?  Which is a fag you think you are.  No, I can actually explain that.  Okay.  Because as a guy, when we were growing up and we were that age, we were going through the 
[153:00]
 same stuff, so you could almost relate more.  You can talk.  You know what's appropriate because you know what's on their minds.  It's because you were going through the same thing.  Now, a girl, it's kind of like where the older brothers type of thing.  You know what I mean?  That's what it is.  But if we talk to a girl like that, it's going to be like, oh my God, you're a freaking  pervert.  Right.  You talk to a kid like that, it's like, yeah, like Ope said, like an older brother.  Tracy, you're right.  It's a fine line.  I mean, we could get in a lot of trouble talking about sex with underage people in general. 
[153:30]
 Oh, you should see the trouble you get in for having sex with the underage.  Never mind talking.  Yeah, I know.  17 will get to 20.  I know.  Ta-da.  We're just trying to do the best we can here.  Okay.  I still love you guys.  Well, thank you, Tracy.  All right.  Hi, Cesar and Raul.  See you guys later.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike.  Cesar and Raul.  Raul.  Mike, what's up?  Yo, Y1A.  Hey.  Another cop checking in.  That's it, bro. 
[154:00]
 A cop show today.  I know.  You guys are making the show way too serious today.  No, no.  I just want to pass along some information.  Yeah.  Vange was on the phone talking about couldn't you sneak around the guy, couldn't you jump  on him.  It's proven statistically that a guy with a knife 10 feet away from you, which is not  a very big distance, he comes after you with a knife.  You're a dead man, even if you have a gun on your side, because you don't have the chance  to react that fast.  I would like these people to walk a mile in our shoes for once, you know? 
[154:30]
 And see, like you said, cops don't just pull their guns out arbitrarily.  It's an amazing decision, but it's something that's going to change everybody's life when  it happens.  And they think we're just like whooping at our guns, and it's like the OK Corral every  time we come up against somebody, you know?  Yeah.  I'd like to hear a little more gunfire in the city, to tell you the truth.  Well, I'm a cop in Jersey, so I'm not in New York all the time.  But when I come in, you're damn right I got a gun on my hip. 
[155:00]
 All right.  But anyway, long time listener.  Love you guys.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, can we get the psychopaths in here, Mark?  Why are you filming me, man?  I know, I look like crap.  Whatever, I look like a fag.  I don't care.  How would you know what a fag looks like, Mark?  I love him more.  Hey, we got two guys, two more psychopaths in the studio.  Brought some, what's in that brown paper bag?  A present. 
[155:30]
 Could I unveil the present?  Yeah, you can unveil the present.  Sure.  He tells me it's shaped like beer.  Anthony, you can't have this today because you're sick.  What is that?  Oh, some candy.  Look at you.  We only get this for you guys.  Very nice.  Thank you.  We were told we were going to get hooked up with prizes and we didn't want to bring anything.  That'll be kind of cool though for my cough, I think, right?  Yes.  That'll soothe it.  Very good, thank you.  Well, we award the psychopaths.  These are the guys that were on Channel 7 last night.  We brought a sign with us.  Let me see the sign. 
[156:00]
 I want to make sure it was you guys.  Definitely.  That was the sign we saw on TV.  Oh, yeah.  You guys, you've got to get smaller signs though.  Only like the W and half the O was on TV.  This thing's like 20 feet long inside.  We're back with primary colors.  We couldn't sell it on eBay so we made a sign out of it.  You guys were little TV stars last night.  Yeah, we were great.  They're old.  We definitely appreciate it.  If you guys get on TV with the wow sign, we invite you down here and we give you a ton 
[156:30]
 of stuff for doing it.  A little tour of the studio and a couple of valuable prizes.  We were hanging out with Span.  We have a lot more respect for him now.  Oh, really?  Well, that goes away.  It's amazing.  He works hard.  People don't think so, but he does.  What's your name?  What's who you want to talk about?  Okay, please hold.  My name is Span.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.  No, F-O- get a pen.  What's the matter with you?  It's stinky, my new employee. 
[157:00]
 Go to Associating.  Good afternoon, Hammett Swisher.  I'm here.  I'm delegating responsibility.  I don't even know what that means.  What's your names?  We should get your names on the radio.  My name is Kevin.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up?  I'm Glenn.  Hey, Glenn.  Thanks for helping out the show.  We appreciate it.  We blew off all our jobs to come in.  Oh, really?  Cool.  We say them and stuff.  Yeah, go ahead.  Say whatever you want.  I work at a local paper called the Montclarion in Montclair.  That's how I happen to be.  The Montclarion?  Yeah. 
[157:30]
 What do you do there?  I'm the advertising director.  Cub reporter?  No.  I'm the major metropolitan newspaper.  He's got a little pad pencil that walks around all day.  Like Jimmy Olsen.  I also work at Time Warp Comics in Cedar Grove.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, nice.  Like a comic book store?  Yeah, great comic book store.  All right, I got a problem.  I just got a problem.  Any guy that works in a comic book store always looks like a kid toucher.  I work there one day a week just to get my head books. 
[158:00]
 I got Pokemon, honey.  You get over here.  Yeah.  That's in the back room.  Yeah, oh, there's a special section in the back.  I'm a waiter at Benegans in Parsippany and a student at actually the school that we're  on TV at, Montclair.  Benegans.  Yeah.  You have plenty of flair on your uniform.  Yeah, exactly.  No, we're not like Fridays and all, all over the place.  Yeah, you don't want your buttons and stuff.  And stuff, no.  I don't like that.  Thanks for having us.  You should just have a button that says like, twat on there, you know, and just come out 
[158:30]
 like mixed in with all the cute little buttons that people wear when they're working.  I give you 35.  Like Fridays, just a big one that says twat.  Yeah, try that.  I wear the one name tag, it says just my name on it, but everything else is just whatever.  We're also directors in Durang One Eye Festival downtown in April.  It's at the New York Comedy Club first and second weeks in April.  Cool, man.  Yeah, One Eye. 
[159:00]
 Cool?  Yeah.  Well, we want to thank you guys for coming by.  We appreciate it.  You've got to follow this guy.  He's going to like completely hook you up with stuff.  You can hang for the rest of the show, all right?  Great.  Thanks so much for having us in.  All right, man.  We appreciate it.  Enjoy the beer.  Thank you.  We will.  We always do.  Remember Make Bridget Cry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bridget is here?  Yeah.  Bring her in, man.  Where's Bridget?  Here, give her that mic over there.  Wow, Bridget.  Hey, Bridget.  Are you weepy today?  I was. 
[159:30]
 Why are you?  Well, let's get everyone up to speed.  Bridget called the show, what, three, four months ago now?  Not that long.  Was it that long ago?  Like three months ago?  Yeah, about three months ago.  All right, and you want to tell the story again?  No.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Is that a problem?  No.  See, she's ready to cry.  You're an emotional girl.  Just tell the story again.  It'll sound better coming from you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  See, we didn't think you were for real.  Now that I see you in our studio, you're definitely for real. 
[160:00]
 All right.  Oh my God, feel that for.  I was going out with a guy for about a year.  Before you start?  Yeah.  Could someone get me the megaphone?  Okay, go ahead.  Guys, get the megaphone!  Spaz, get the megaphone!  What, Spaz?  I thought Tyson was sick today.  This is too good.  Okay.  No, I'll be nice.  Go ahead.  How did that story go? 
[160:30]
 Going out with a guy for a year.  How old are you, Bridget?  I'm 20 today.  20 today?  It's her birthday.  It's my birthday, that's why I came here.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  No, no, no.  I continue your story.  What happened?  I'm usually not into redheads, but you're definitely cute.  I'm into redheads.  You're a redhead.  I know, that's why I'm not into them.  I count them in so hard, that they sleep.  But go ahead.  Okay, Bridget, your story.  Bridget, D, Y.  20 years old today. 
[161:00]
 All right.  Right.  And I hadn't done anything really with him.  This was a guy you really, really liked, right?  Yeah.  Like you still like him now?  No.  Oh, no, you sure?  I'm sure.  Okay.  There's a bunch of guys that want to play Make Bridget Cry on the line already.  What happened, Bridget?  Okay, so you were really into this guy at the time.  I called here because I wanted to do something nice for him for his birthday.  And Anthony was kind enough to give me some instructions.  Well, he kind of suggested that your hob is not. 
[161:30]
 Anthony's a freaking pervert.  All right.  And so I did.  And the instructions were very good.  Yeah, we even gave you step by step how to go about it, right?  Which was very useful.  Okay.  And I got to the end and he freaked out.  All right, but this was the first time you ever gave a homer, right?  Right.  Okay.  And he freaked out when you were done?  He freaked out.  Uh-huh.  And he called me a whore. 
[162:00]
 He called you a whore?  And then what did he do?  And then very much in Iron Mike style, he threw me backwards.  Walked out?  And that was it?  Threw you backwards and called you a whore?  Well, that's despicable.  I can't believe this guy.  What a...  I would like to punch him.  He called you a whore and pushed you and didn't even punch you. 
[162:30]
 What kind of man is that?  Shut up!  So then you calmed up, Opie and Anthony and started...  My boyfriend called me a whore and pushed me down.  But you know something?  You're a whore!  What are you doing?  Putting that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been.  Shut up!  So you like doing that kind of thing?  Why don't you come over to Iron Mike, pull down the fly, 
[163:00]
 and unleash ten inches of Louisiana black snake?  It's got a mind of its own.  It'll call you a whore and push you.  Or by itself.  It's easier to do this when she's on the phone.  She really looks like she's ready to cry.  I'm working on it.  Wait, there's part two to this story now, Anthony and Mike.  Baby, baby, stick your head in gravy, wash it off with bubble gum 
[163:30]
 and punch you in the uterus.  She was supposed to be here at 4.30.  So Bridget, what happened?  I missed my exit for the tunnel and I took the George Washington instead,  which I thought would be fine, even though I'd seen New York pass a while before that.  And so I figured once I took the George Washington, I could just hop on a road and drive here.  Put down that mic a little closer, make her believe it's your boyfriend.  No, I mean, you can't really hear.  You just missed a great part of the story. 
[164:00]
 A lot of people are going, oh my God, she was on the George Washington  and figured I'll just turn off anywhere and find my way to the station.  Exactly.  So I realized it was kind of a bad neighborhood.  The default road anywhere leads you to the bad neighborhood.  When you get lost in New York, you will always end up in a bad neighborhood.  Right, which I thought was fine, but it just kept getting a little worse.  Yeah. 
[164:30]
 And then I stopped seeing street signs because they were all torn down.  Translation.  Dr. Walker.  At which point I called you guys for help.  And was it Kevin?  Spazzy.  Spazzy.  I'll talk in.  It's good I'll talk in.  And?  Drive until you don't see anymore black people.  That's my help.  Were you really scared?  I was pretty scared.  Yeah, people kept walking up to the car every time I stopped at a red light.  Yeah.  Wow, what did they want? 
[165:00]
 I don't know.  I ran a couple red lights.  I got really scared.  You ran red lights.  That's good.  Very good.  You learned very quick.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  Wow.  But then I got here.  It was okay.  Yeah.  You're okay now?  I'm okay now.  You have a boyfriend now or anything?  No.  You want to be my girlfriend?  Sure.  Yeah.  Just one try and see what your mindset is here.  Would you like to play a quick round of Make Bridget Cry?  I mean they're all waiting.  Sure.  Are you serious?  Sure.  I don't think I'll cry. 
[165:30]
 All right.  Let's take a quick break.  And we're going to play another round of Make Bridget Cry.  They're all waiting.  We'll be back in a couple minutes.  Stay there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

 No, I really like you guys for me to be doing this.  Oh, okay, that's obvious.  Okay, ready?  Yes, we're ready.  Is that good enough?  Hmm.  Um, it was kinda hard to hear.  Are you using the right part of the phone?  Yeah, it's like.  The mouthpiece, yes.  The mouthpiece, yes.  Rub a little harder.  Uh-huh.  A little faster.  Yeah.  And a little longer.  Side by side, you gotta work it on all angles. 
[171:00]
 Yeah.  Okay, all right.  Is that good enough?  All right, all right, I'm getting an indication.  We're getting there.  You gotta pull your little panties out?  Yes, of course.  Don't want daddy to catch you.  Can I come back in now?  Um, yeah, okay.  Okay.  All right, I think we got a pretty good indication. 
[171:30]
 Yeah, it's very brillo-patti, but short, cropped.  I'm gonna go with.  I'm gonna go, go ahead, yeah.  I'm gonna go with triangle, but trimmed.  Wow, you're getting notes from the wow guys  from last night, from Channel 7.  Yeah, get them in here, let me see what they're thinking.  So you say what it?  Now don't say what it is until we ask you.  All right, I'm going with just a groomed, 
[172:00]
 very well trimmed, but still in a triangular shape, okay?  Guys?  I'm gonna say a very closely shaved Hitler mustache.  Okay.  I'm thinking completely shaved.  Wow, he's going completely shaved, Opie?  I don't know, she's too,  wasn't much there in the sound there.  She's innocent looking though, Opie.  Hey, man.  I'm gonna go, I think I gotta agree with that.  Really?  I'd like to try to come up with a different one,  but it seems like a well-groomed triangle.  All right, are we ready? 
[172:30]
 Yes, we are.  If you would please.  Fridja, what's in your pants?  You guys are right.  Yes, yes.  See, and I'll tell you why I said that.  I'll even give you my reasoning.  It seemed like.  It's trimmed.  Yeah, it seemed like there was a lot more area  than just a mohawk.  Like she was moving the phone and you were hearing  whew, whew, whew, whew.  Mohawk side to side, just whew, whew, whew, whew.  Very short trip.  You see what I mean?  And then well-groomed because we weren't getting  that real thick thatch, 
[173:00]
 like the machete through the jungle kind of sound.  So I opted for the well-groomed triangle.  Wow, all right.  All right, come on, let's say it.  Ah, come on, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Can we see your panties?  Did you see?  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  No.  She don't like showing.  Oh, really?  I don't know, I'm just saying that.  It's obvious.  All right, well these guys wanna talk to Bridget.  I think they wanna try to make you cry.  Do we have like a prize for someone  that makes her cry today? 
[173:30]
 Maybe a gift certificate to Paisano?  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on WNEW, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, hope you're here today.  How are you?  All right, how are you, you little dirty horse?  Oh, my God.  You didn't get this chick to do anything, huh?  That's a fine introduction.  Yeah.  Were you conceived in a petri dish?  Wow.  Does she know what a petri dish is? 
[174:00]
 I know very well what a petri dish is.  Were you conceived there?  Were you conceived?  No, I wasn't.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Steve, very good job.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got one more in you?  Yes, I do.  All right, this is gonna be your final statement.  Okay, does she know what she has in common with a condom?  What?  When you're done, you just pull it off  and throw it on the floor.  Steve, very good.  She's actually laughing now. 
[174:30]
 Come on, cry.  Cry, bitch.  There goes Steve.  We're playing make Bridget cry.  The guy with the wow sign, that light sign,  is in the other studio.  Dave, you're next.  Looks like the big light's behind Kiss.  Yeah.  That's us.  Hey, O&A.  How are you, Dave?  What's up?  Hey, Bridget, you dirty little whore.  I got something for you.  Hey, Bridget, maybe you, it's not what you did,  but how you were doing it.  You don't sound like the sharpest tool in the shed, 
[175:00]
 you know?  You'd jump in your eyes when you were doing it or what?  You sure you weren't where you were?  Sure you weren't sucking on this toe?  You dumb whore.  You wanted to run with your underwear around, huh?  You're 20 years old, you look like a whore too.  You dirty pig.  Come down there and smack you with my unit.  It's so much easier to do this when she's on the phone.  Oh, it's great, O&B.  She's way too innocent for this, man.  Hey, Bridget, you got anything to say or is your mouth full? 
[175:30]
 Yeah, I'm sure you're laughing.  You wouldn't be laughing.  You'd be going, oh, oh, oh.  You dirty pig.  All right, Dave, thank you.  Thank you, guys, you're the best.  Very good, Mark.  No, no, she's not crying.  Psycho Mark, check her eyes.  No. Nothing yet, okay?  No, she's not crying.  All right, she's holding tough here.  Rob, you're next.  Yeah, I don't wanna make Bridget cry,  I wanna make her happy.  Okay.  I wanna take Bridget out and teach her  how bad a Bridget.  She seems a little disgusted. 
[176:00]
 No, I'm not disgusted.  Bridget, has anyone gone south on you yet?  No.  No, wait, wait.  You'll cry from ecstasy.  All right, wait a minute.  Hold the phone.  This is a revelation.  No one's ever done that to you.  That's where we get in the old day.  Would you like someone to do that?  Eventually.  Don't you? Eventually.  Like by seven o'clock?  Eventually?  What are we looking at here as a timeframe?  I believe we have a few takers. 
[176:30]
 Are you still a virgin, Bridget?  Oh, okay.  Now that explains a little better.  Also, you'll give your boyfriend a little gift of a hummer,  little virgin girl,  and he dissed you like that.  Yep.  Oh, that's pretty bad.  That's pretty bad.  Are you interested in Rob's offer, Bridget?  Thank you, Rob.  I can't.  She can't, okay.  She's like one of those fresh clams 
[177:00]
 in the barbecue, in the ice.  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, you're next.  Hello?  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I want to take her out too, man.  I live in Jersey.  I know she lives in Jersey.  Yeah, everyone wants to take her out.  I'm 21 years old.  I work, you know, come on.  Come on, come on, come on, give it up.  It's like, come on, throw me a bone.  I'm working right now, guys.  I don't think she's looking for a date at this moment.  Come on, I'm gonna take her out, show her a good time,  you know, show her a good time.  I'm gonna go to Richie.  Richie, you're next on Eddie W. 
[177:30]
 What's up?  You low self-esteem cheese crotch bitch.  You are such a disgusting pig.  You know that?  You're a 20-year-old lowlife with no self-esteem.  What's the matter, you have no parents?  Piggy and pig-lit?  Is that your parents?  Is that your little bitch?  Huh?  I can't hear you.  You're tongue-tied  or you got your freaking crotch in your mouth.  What's going on?  This is brutal.  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.  Mark?  I'm crying, I'm crying.  Richie, you're not listening.  Richie, turn around.  I was listening. 
[178:00]
 I got it, go ahead, go ahead.  I'm sorry about that.  All right.  So what's going on there, little girl?  You have nothing better to do?  What's the matter, she can't talk?  Is she that stupid or are you a mute?  What's the matter with her?  I don't really know what the question is.  What do you mean you don't know what the question is?  You're a bitch.  That's a statement, not a question.  Where the hell did you go to school?  You stupid bitch, I can't even believe you.  You're such a smelly bitch.  Oh, this is awful.  Unbelievable.  This is just awful.  All in that, you guys rule later.  All right, Richie, good job. 
[178:30]
 Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  Mark, what's going on?  Oh, hell, we're playing the game.  Might as well give the guy credit.  But what's up, Mark?  What's up?  Hey.  Listen, before I start, I just want to ask Anthony,  I got a couple extra tickets to Riverdance  if he wants to come.  Oh, bro.  Thank you.  Where's little red riding whore?  I'm right here.  I don't want to take you out.  You know why your boyfriend smacked you in the head?  Because you probably smell.  You're a little whore of tea. 
[179:00]
 I knew you weren't that sort.  Ronald McDonald had a whore.  You pig.  There's some angry people out there.  Jesus.  I'm frightened.  What do you think her boyfriend smacked her in the head for?  Because he didn't give her any.  Hummers.  Who wants hummers all the time?  Hummers.  All right.  I thought he smacked you.  All right, Mark.  Thanks, guys.  We're only going to give three more guys a chance,  and then we're going to wrap up the game.  Mike?  Danny, what's up?  Make Bridget cry.  I don't want to make Bridget cry.  I want to make her happy.  Okay. 
[179:30]
 She's gorgeous.  Okay, good.  Now?  Yeah.  Come on, I can do it.  All right.  That's not going to work.  That's very bad.  Two to go, Bridget.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, I wanted to ask Bridget out, too.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Do you want to go out?  I live in Jersey.  This game is changing drastically.  Hey, you know, hey.  That's bordering on a dial-a-date.  Ooh.  Ripping me off.  You invented that.  That's right.  All right, thank you, Mark.  All right.  All right, I guess we have one more contestant. 
[180:00]
 Let's go to Scott.  Hey, O-R-A.  What's up, buddy?  I think they're going about it the wrong way.  Bridget, you're 20 years old today, right?  Yes.  So you were with this guy last year, huh?  Mm-hmm.  That must be kind of tough in your birthday  and like when you're alone late at night.  What goes through your head?  I mean, don't you miss a guy?  I know you say you don't,  but there's got to be times where it's tough,  especially on days like today.  I miss him.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You might just be kidding yourself. 
[180:30]
 Have you seen the guy around at all  or are you trying to like, you know,  stay out of his neighborhood?  I've stayed away from him.  Oh, man.  It's got to be tough, though.  So he was around last birthday, huh?  Yeah.  Where'd he get you?  Was it something nice  or was it just some really crappy thing?  Bike pedals.  What?  Bike pedals.  What?  Give her a hug.  He got me bike pedals.  All right, bye, Lord.  All right, guys, you guys rule.  Why did he get your bike pedals? 
[181:00]
 Because that's what I wanted.  Like just pedals for your bike?  So that you can clip on with your shoes  on your mountain bike.  Woo, yeah, you did lose a catch.  Jeez, let me tell you.  Hey, Ron, what's up?  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Jeez, if you were together this year,  maybe he would have gotten you the hand grips  with the little screamers flying off in the ends.  Hey, Billy, what's up?  Fair to dream.  Hey, listen, Bridget.  Okay, listen. What would grandma think?  You know, dead grandma? 
[181:30]
 With you with a mouth, old grandma?  Baked a cake for you and everything?  And now you're with a mouth full of that?  Horrible.  What about your mother?  Your poor mother, she used to carry you around  in the baby carriage and you had a mouth full  of his goo in your mouth.  Oh my God.  It's horrible.  Don't you think about your family members  when you're doing that?  Oh, Bridget, remember grandma used to bake the cakes? 
[182:00]
 Whoa, she's got a tear in her eye.  I got her, oh, and I...  I just want to stop.  Come on.  Oh no.  Wait a minute.  We have a winner.  Here you go, Ron.  Billy, you're a winner.  Wow, Billy taking the tact of the family members.  Wait, Bridget, go under the light.  I swear to God, go under the light.  Just move your whole body under the light.  Clear your hair away a little bit, yeah.  You got it.  You got it. 
[182:30]
 Oh my God.  What are you doing?  Wow, Billy, very strategic move Billy made.  There you go.  Going away from the degrading her  to the family sensitivity angle, very smart man.  Beautiful, right, O.A.?  And he pulls out a victory.  Look, he's all proud.  Now what do you want, Billy?  What do you got for me, man?  You could get a gift certificate to Paesano,  the official restaurant of the O&A show pretty much.  We got some CDs we could throw together for you.  How about any wrestling?  My kid brother loves that crap. 
[183:00]
 Do we have wrestling?  All right, we have wrestling tickets.  Excellent.  Thanks, dude.  Hold on the line, it's for the WWF event,  I believe April 15th at the Garden.  I'll play you a good one.  And tickets go on sale Sunday at Ticketmaster.  All right.  And we'll throw in a T-shirt, all right?  Excellent, thanks dude.  Congratulations, you heartless scumbag.  Bye, Billy.  Bye bye.  All right.  Billy's on line 10, he wins the prizes.  I saw the tear.  Oh wow.  That was mean.  That was not good. 
[183:30]
 You wanted to play, Bridget.  I know, I'm fine.  What got you?  That was just gross.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not really, you don't wanna think of your grandmother.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't wanna think of your grandma.  I understand.  That old, dried uterus.  Silly shit, silly shit.  Oh, we're going template. 
[184:00]
 Goddamn template.  Hey, who's this?  Yo, yo, yo, who's this?  Yeah, this is the last, only black guy  that listens to this show.  Ah.  We're the only three guys.  Now we have a bunch of black guys listening to this show.  Yeah, one of the only three of us  that went to the Super Bowl party  was the only three guys there.  What is that?  Exactly.  No one of those people bring that snatch phone  to the next road show.  What's up?  What's up?  Gotta bring the snatch phone to the next road show.  Snatch phone on tour.  Definitely.  Who's gonna use that phone?  She rubbed the snatch all over it.  Yeah, she's a virgin,  and she pulled down her tiny little panties, 
[184:30]
 and that was pretty nice.  All the guys trying to make her cry about giving her hummers,  man, my girl listens to this stage.  You trying to kill me?  What's going on?  Yeah, right?  For real, what are you talking bad about?  You're making her think about her grandmother.  What's going on?  Hey, I gotta ask you,  what does the black community think  of all the white guys that are all imitating the,  what's up?  We're not laughing with you, we're laughing at you.  I know you guys are.  We're laughing at you, that's right, I'm way too loud.  You guys come up with the greatest phrases,  and then Whitey wrecks them. 
[185:00]
 Destroys them.  You guys, you guys,  you guys got like everyone on Wall Street walking around  going, what's up?  All right, you guys rule.  All right, man, peace.  Opie, are you saying there's no black people on Wall Street?  Well, yeah, there's a few.  I had to think that.  Trying to think of what you were saying.  Well, there's a lot of white guys on Wall Street.  You know what I'm saying.  No.  Oh, shut up.  Please explain yourself.  No, thank you.  All right, can we play a quick round of- 
[185:30]
 Racial profiling going on here  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, big surprise.  Did you check the calendar?  It was my turn today, I asked you.  Yes.  All right, you wanna play a quick round  of what do we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Wow, look at the time.  212-757-1027.  Wanna thank the guys that were on TV yesterday  with the wow signs on channel seven.  Great job, guys.  Did Ben hook you guys up with some stuff or what?  Yeah, he definitely hooked us up.  Really?  You get your banner on TV, you come down,  little tour of the studio and some prizes. 
[186:00]
 He sat on the lesbian couch for an hour.  Ah, there you go.  He got to sit on the lesbian couch.  And we didn't even know until an hour later, but-  Something will be growing on your pants on the way home.  Believe me, it's like a culture.  Yogurt cultures.  That's scary.  And of course we gotta thank Bridget for stopping by.  The famous Bridget for Make Bridget Cry.  We gotta get you at one of our road shows.  You have to be 21?  We could probably-  We'll get you in as a stage prop or something.  Yeah.  You know, put you in a packing case. 
[186:30]
 Or we'll just tour you around with the phone.  People can laugh, forget it.  Look at me.  Dollar sniff.  Oh, come on.  Rick's not here.  Opie's gotta take the over the line role today.  I feel left out, guys.  All right, let's go to Ed.  Hey guys, how you doing?  What's up?  Hey, you know what I learned today?  I learned that maybe you should smell the phone.  Maybe that's why nobody-  Mark, go take a, no, spaz. 
[187:00]
 Where's spaz?  Anthony.  Yeah?  Get the phone in here.  Like, uh-oh.  Are you gonna eat your fat?  What?  Are you gonna eat your fat?  Oh, you're right, right, from Caddyshark.  God damn.  You're gonna eat your fat?  What comes next, man?  I'm thinking.  Oh, I'm sick, man.  I can't think today.  I'm heavily medicated.  Sorry, man.  What is it?  Spalding.  Oh, I was gonna say that too.  Spalding. 
[187:30]
 Spalding.  All right.  I'm clean.  Thank you, Ed.  We got the phone in the studio.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Was this the phone, Bridget?  Oh.  Is that the phone?  No, I wanna leave.  Is it?  What?  Yeah.  Why do you wanna leave?  What?  Oh my God, you're embarrassing her.  Why?  Go ahead, give it one.  Oh.  Any hairs? 
[188:00]
 No hairs?  No.  Smells pretty good.  Because this is like Psycho Mark's phone.  With the hot breath he has,  this thing usually smells pretty bad.  There you go.  Ah, you're flowery.  Very nice.  No.  There's like a flowery smell to it.  Sure.  Guys, would you like a sniff?  I don't have a sense of smell, but these two can.  No, that's a-  What's with the people with no sense of smell  popping up every so often?  Psycho Mark? 
[188:30]
 Smell the phone.  All right, pass it along.  I'll model that scent.  Oh my God.  Give it to the guy with the big, huge light up wow sign.  There you go.  Don't foul it with your hands.  Ooh, thumbs up.  People passing it around like a fine wine.  Yes, delicate bouquet.  Nice legs, yes.  He's taking a big whiff over there, man.  All right, give Spaz. 
[189:00]
 It's like passing around like a pot pipe.  Spaz?  That's about past that.  Wait, wait, Spaz, what do you think?  Well, say it in the mic.  Say it in the mic.  Smells fresh.  Fresh as a daisy.  Virg, it's very embarrassed right now.  All right, there you go.  Here, Stank, put the phone back.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  All right, go on.  All right, so I had to dump out.  Oh my God. 
[189:30]
 Go on, I had to bust up the tension in here.  You can't say that.  I know, you can't.  Your Alana's mom's going crazy.  Sorry.  Unbelievable.  All right, Lisa, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that next time I call Opie and Anthony  and start moaning and groaning and announcing I'm high,  make sure my mom doesn't come home from work.  She was listening?  Yeah, and I went to get a drink of water  and she was right there.  So I'm like in my room and I'm not moving from here 
[190:00]
 for like, for a while now.  Are you still real high?  Oh yeah, definitely.  All right, you sound like you're crashing  a little bit at this point.  Listen guys, can I come up to your show one day?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they let anyone in, you might as well.  Yeah, all you gotta do is show up.  We'll send you right down.  Look at these clowns, they got us.  All right, all right, Lisa.  Okay, see you soon.  I learned Bridget is a virgin and she uses 
[190:30]
 nice perfumes on her.  Oh, man.  So you just soap and water, basically?  Basically, yeah.  Did it take your perfume in and just do a quick like?  No.  No, huh?  Okay.  We'll take one more call,  we gotta step aside for Donna Mike.  Tom, you're next on Eddie W, the last call of the day.  How you doing all night?  Good.  I learned that redheaded virgins smell flowery.  You guys rule, Genesco grads rule. 
[191:00]
 Oh, cool, thanks, Tom.  And there we go, another radio show behind us, Anton.  Whoa, yeah, look at that.  Gotta thank Bridget, let's hear it for Bridget  for being a good sport today.  Thanks, Tom.  Let's make Bridget cry.  We came on strong in the end,  I think the coffee helped us out.  Yeah, it definitely helped us out.  Right about five o'clock or so, we dosed up.  Had some cup of crack.  Yeah, and then Psycho Mark brought in like an eight ball.  We all just snorted as much cocaine as we could  before our hearts exploded. 
[191:30]
 And it really picked the show up, I think.  It really helped us out today, I gotta say, sure.  And then thank you, the guys that came down  with the last ones and the crystal meth, that was great.  Yeah, now I just gotta get this ecstasy out of my system.  I'm gonna do a lude and maybe just speed ball  directly into the retina and I'll be fine.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow too, all right?  Stay tuned for Donna Mike.  Opie.  Boring.  Amphibious.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spat.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[192:00]
 1027 WNEW.
