 ...Opie and Anthony.  Oh, stupid.  We had guys lifting stuff with their units.  Drones!  Yes.  Excuse me, taking a big, bold, faceless...  Scotty, you've got to get our...  ...rejective membrane vaginal seal back up!  ...panties.  I thought I had no panties on!  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  Hey!  That is the rest of the couple.  Insane.  We had guys come in that enjoy getting kicked in the nats.  Big parent!  You really don't know where the uh, fan-times are, right? 
[00:30]
 Just, ah...  Ivory has reloaded!  Oh, that one!  Yeah, that one just over 8 feet OB and Anthony.  Dopey ass show.  This is WNEW.  Hello Anthony!  Hey, hey!  It's FU Friday.  We made it to the end of another week of broadcasting, Anthony.  Where's our goddamn coffee?  Yeah, what happened to our coffee? We need coffee!  We did a coffee thing now before the show. 
[01:00]
 It needs coffee!  It needs coffee!  Where's the coffee?  Please?  Thank you, please.  Yeah.  Are we sending Stinky to get coffee or what?  Oh, go ahead, Stinky.  We gotta put Stinky on the spaz cam today.  Why?  Because he's goofy.  Because he's goofy.  What then?  You might as well say it on the air. What? 
[01:30]
 Spacebar.  His spacebar?  Alright.  Yeah, it's FU Friday, Anthony.  Yeah, of course, if something pissed you off this week,  and you want to tell a couple million people,  you give us a call.  212-757-1027, right?  Feel free.  Or you can send a fax.  If you're gonna send a fax, make it short and to the point,  because we get probably like a thousand faxes by the end of the show.  We're not gonna read the long drawn out ones, alright?  I make it short and quick, and we'll try to read that on the air as well. 
[02:00]
 212-957-9639 is the fax line.  Right.  Also, a lot of controversy over the most offensive song contest.  Oh, Jesus. Unbelievable.  People just going crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, people angered by this contest.  And it is the most offensive song ever written contest.  So, of course, people are gonna call in and email,  because it's offensive. 
[02:30]
 The most offensive.  And yesterday, I think when we played the song that is in the lead right now,  which is Baby Raper.  Baby Raper.  You know, go figure.  Someone would get all pissed off at a song with the title Baby Raper.  Well, you know, this is the People's Radio Show.  We did ask you guys if we should go forward with this contest,  and you guys said you have to go forward with this contest.  Did you at some point start humming that last night?  In the middle of the night.  In the middle of the night, I had to take a leak. 
[03:00]
 Yeah.  So, the outrage is incredible.  The boss was on the phone half the morning, he said.  Yeah.  Very angry.  We tried to explain that this contest would get really ugly.  It's only gonna get uglier, by the way.  Yeah.  I mean, the songs are starting to pour in now.  That just set the bar at where you have to be.  And I must say, we had what, Rick, about 10 entries today? 
[03:30]
 About 10 entries today?  None of them will be played on our radio show today.  Why is that?  Because they don't come close to Baby Raper.  Aha.  We would disappoint you guys if we played the entry that came in today.  They don't come close.  And a lot of people voting for the fetus song, too.  Kill a fetus.  Coming back strong.  After people had a data to mull it over.  Coming back strong in the email, Anthony.  People thinking it over.  We've decided that we're gonna have a road show, 
[04:00]
 and we're gonna get the top four or five most offensive songs  and have those people play them live in front of 1,500 of our listeners.  They'd love that.  And then we'll have the listeners decide who wrote the most offensive song.  So as we speak, we're trying to get a road show together for early April.  A couple weeks into April, maybe mid-April.  Sure.  So you still have time to get your song in for the contest. 
[04:30]
 Right.  Well, the phones are just going BS right now,  so let's take a quick break, Anthony.  All right.  And we'll be back.  We'll go to the phones next and see what you guys are talking about today, okay?  Cool.  212-757-1027.  Lots to do today, by the way.  We're gonna play all the offensive songs that we've gotten so far.  We got Smelly Karen coming in for her sponge bath.  Yeah.  It's FU Friday.  And of course, whatever you guys want to add as well.  All right?  212-757-1027. 
[05:00]
 Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are fags!  1027-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Mountain Dew!  Yeah, we got something going on with Mountain Dew, don't we?  Yes, we do.  Mountain Dew, the official soft drink of the NCAA, wants to send you to the Final Four.  On Monday, March 13th, this coming Monday,  the 64 teams goes up on the WNEW website, all right, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  Looking for you college basketball fans to go to www.wnew.com 
[05:30]

And we'll keep everyone up to date on what's happening in the tournament  and how many people we're down to, stuff like that, okay?  Right.  Once the Final Four teams are announced, we're going to announce the winner,  and that person is going to fly to see the Final Four live and in person, Anthony.  Great. This is a great trip.  So keep the weekend of April 1st open.  So do the Dew of Mountain Dew and listen to us to win a trip to the Final Four.  You get to start registering on Monday. 
[06:00]
 Go to www.wnew.com.  WNEW New York. Infinity Broadcasting.  Opie and Anthony.  You get to listen to somebody's cell phones or somebody's uterus.  More stupidities on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  One of the many things we're doing on the show today is featuring all the offensive songs  that we have received, of course, Stephen Lynch.  Yes. 
[06:30]
 I don't know, I think we have about five or six from him alone, Anthony.  Very offensive, but if we're going to be playing offensive songs today that we have received,  we've got to play Stephen Lynch's pre-song.  That one's very offensive.  And of course, we've got to play the one that started it all in a little while,  the FBA, Full Blown AIDS.  Full Blown AIDS, that was the inspiration for our contest,  most offensive song ever written.  Yeah.  So as the show goes on, we'll play all of them.  Sure. 
[07:00]
 Okay. Maybe even one more play of the Barry Manilow most offensive song.  That one's good just for the fact that the guy can't sing.  Yeah.  His voice is offensive.  And we'll play that one next, as a matter of fact.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and see what everyone is talking about.  We'll go to Antonio.  Antonio!  Anthony!  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  Anthony.  Oh.  Hello.  Every day it's something different with the phones. 
[07:30]
 Are you there, Anthony?  Okay.  Now I can't hang up.  Uh-oh.  It'll be one of those days, isn't it?  Kevin!  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Kevin?  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  Good.  That last song was great.  The Kitten Song?  Yeah.  That's the first time you heard that?  Yes, I did.  Let me tell you something about the Kitten Song from Stephen Lynch.  You know that we get more complaints after we play Kill a Kitten  than we did after we played Kill a Fetus? 
[08:00]
 Oh, yeah?  I swear to you, we played Kill a Fetus yesterday by Billy and Paul from Airsick.net.  Yeah, I heard that.  We didn't get that many complaint calls today, but when we played that Kill a Kitten song,  oh my God, the animal rights activist out of the woodwork.  Yeah, I don't know.  I feel there's no use for cats on this earth.  Oh, jeez.  I just hate cats.  All right.  Well, thank you, Kevin.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Take care.  Let's go to Maria.  Maria, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you today? 
[08:30]
 Doing good, doing good.  I really love that song, but I must say that the abortion song kind of beat this one.  Well, yeah, we know that.  It's between, at this point, the Kill a Fetus song and Baby Rapist.  And Baby Rapist is the most offensive song.  Yeah.  But we're just going to feature all the offensive songs today on the show.  Yeah, can I give an F-U to my brother Orrin in the Bronx?  It's his birthday today, and he just took the day off.  All right.  Well, you just did.  Oh, great.  Cool.  All right.  You guys are the best, man. 
[09:00]
 I'm listening to Howard Stern completely.  I mean, I'm listening to you guys every single day.  You could listen to him in the morning.  Yeah, we're not really listening to him.  And listen to us in the afternoon.  No, no.  I mean, he's like...  We're not competing with him.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that you guys are.  I mean, he's like old news, and you guys are definitely the new news.  Ah.  And you guys should definitely... you guys should definitely overrule Howard Stern no  matter what, because you guys are the best.  All right, Maria.  Thank you very much.  Take care.  All right.  All right.  All right.

[18:30]
 All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Stinky, load up the fridge, chop chop, chop chop.  I want them cleaned and bumped with a fine shimmy.  Yeah.  I got in early today.  I'm like, man, there was a party going on here after I left.  Well, Psycho Mark drinking and telling his stories about his life and his childhood and  growing up in Boston. 
[19:00]
 I was rolling, just laughing my ass off.  And then he's like, I got to get out of here.  Ah, one more.  One more.  I got to get cocked before I leave.  And we were just pounding him last night.  Every two seconds, that fridge was opening and closing.  He should just put a revolving door on that frigging refrigerator.  I left just when it was getting interesting.  And man, I was convinced old Dirty was going to punch you in the face, Psycho Mark.  Old Dirty getting angry.  I tell you, the language that flies when there's a few beers back there in that office and 
[19:30]
 we're all sitting around joking.  No one's safe.  Unbelievable.  The racist rhetoric you hear coming out of everyone's mouth.  And it does white, black.  It doesn't matter who's saying it.  I was going to say, it doesn't matter what color you are.  I mean, everyone got it.  So unbelievable.  All I heard, I don't know who said it, but what was it?  Just shut up and get me another beer, you big lipped bastard.  That's all I heard.  I'm like, oh my god. 
[20:00]
 What, you're nuts?  Well, then you shut your ass, you cracker.  Oh, yeah.  Kick your white ass.  There's a race riot going on back there.  Yeah.  Well, it looked like you guys had a good time.  Grab, bring the pool in here real fast before they put the water in it.  Let's see this thing.  We have Smelly Karen coming down at around 430 today.  Smelly Karen.  And she's going to get sponged down by some really, really hot girls.  We're going to show her how it's done to keep clean.  And look at this pool, Anthony. 
[20:30]
 Yeah, that's a good pool.  That's a nice size kiddie pool.  Nice.  That's got to be about a foot and a half deep, I guess.  A foot and a half deep, and that's at least six to seven feet across, I would just say.  Two feet deep, six or seven feet across.  Yeah, that's a big one.  Because we're going to have at least four or five girls in there.  How are we filling this up?  Yeah, how are we filling this up?  Going to take a leak in it.  I just blew it.  Someone else has to worry about the water.  Did we get a tarp?  Do we have any type of hose that could look up to a sink that people fill their water beds with or something? 
[21:00]
 Do we have a bucket?  Are we doing the bucket route?  Did anyone think of this?  If we're doing the bucket route, you guys better get to it.  You better start now because we only have an hour before everyone arrives.  Make it warm and stuff.  Make it warm and really soapy.  On the hot side of warm.  Make it very hot because by the time 430 hits, it'll cool off.  Exactly.  All right.  Wow.  Lots of stuff today, Anthony.  Let's play another one of the offensive songs, okay? 
[21:30]
 Mm-hmm.  This was the first entry that we played on the air.  And it's a loser at this point.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I think his name was Anthony.  He even called and said, look, it's over.  I know it.  He conceded defeat.  He conceded defeat to Killifetus.  But it's pretty bad.  Yeah.  The singing is really great.  The middle of the song, applause break.  It's like Barry Manilow used to have.  All right.  One more time before we bury this one. 
[22:00]
 It's called the most offensive song on WNEW.  You kids should give it a try. 
[22:30]
 I brought from Korean store clerks,  active churches, turned down playgrounds, and hospitals.  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  The gumball arts don't understand the words.  KKK friends, but mention niggers to hear. 
[23:00]
 The most offensive song this year.  Rocker was right when he said things that we think but don't say.  I put it on him, he wants some human things. 
[23:30]
 He can deny it and say that this is.  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  A boy defeated since, but still maxed his head.  The last time that the brownie humans were here.  The most offensive song this year. 
[24:00]
 The Italian mafia, giant stadium, lines hop up.  Barefoot and pregnant, it's all women are good for.  Statue of Liberty should be art with an O Z.  Shoot the stick, shoot the miss, shoot the gas, shoot the rocks.  Come a green pod, go home.  The most offensive song you've ever heard. 
[24:30]
 The fast-spitting Irish people are slow.  The teens do not see them, they change with the world.  The most offensive song this year.  The most offensive song you've ever heard. 
[25:00]
 The fast-spitting Irish people are slow.  The fast-spitting Irish people are slow.  This is the last time you will hear.  The most offensive song this year. 
[25:30]
 The most offensive song this year. 
[26:00]
 The most offensive song this year. 
[26:30]
 The most offensive song this year.  The most offensive song this year.  The most offensive song this year. 
[27:00]
 The most offensive song this year.  Smelly Karen coming in at 4.30 for her sponge bath.  My God, man.  Hot, beautiful girls, naked, giving her a sponge bath.  A nice soapy sponge bath, Anthony.  We gotta call her Smelly Karen.  She's gonna get very upset.  Maybe not show up, wait till she gets here.  Well, everyone has a name on this show, you know?  You can't just say Karen.  Yeah, but what does that mean?  Smelly Karen, our listeners know what Smelly Karen is. 
[27:30]
 Smelly Karen.  I did tell her if she was nice and clean after the sponge bath  that we would drop the Smelly from her name.  That's only fair, right?  Yeah.  So they're filling up the pool outside,  but knowing our little radio staff,  I'm sure something's gonna go drastically wrong.  It's gonna explode.  Ben, like, gallons of water all over the...  Ben's looking out the studio door.  What's going on so far, Ben?  I see, like, Spaz and Stinky.  So you guys don't really know Stinky that well yet,  but Stinky is the clone of Spaz. 
[28:00]
 Right.  We truly believe that at this point.  He runs around like a lunatic just like his boss Spaz.  Yeah.  And all I see through the studio door  is them just frantically running around the place out there.  Are they getting anything done, Ben?  We've got the pool is ready to go.  We now get the tarp under it.  Now we're just gonna fill it.  Now, did no one figure out how we're gonna fill this pool?  No.  I guess we're just gonna take the bucket  and just fill it up from the chain more sweet.  I'll bring mouthfuls of water over and just spit it out.  No, what's going on, Anthony?  It's pretty funny. 
[28:30]
 It's pretty funny.  Like, Spaz and Stinky, they're just kind of walking by  the kiddie pool trying to figure it out.  They're like, OK, pool, water.  How do we do that?  How do we get the water now in the pool?  And they're walking by like they're real busy  and they know exactly what's going on,  but you can just tell that there's like  just nothing happening in their brains  as they try to figure this out.  There's nothing funny than Spaz trying to get Stinky direction  so he's like, OK, you gotta do this.  You gotta do what I tell you.  Here, get Spaz and Stinky in here real fast.  Stinky. 
[29:00]
 Spaz.  Oh, God.  They look like twins.  I swear. Look at them.  They look like brothers.  They even have the same goofy smile.  All right.  Guys, have you figured out how to fill up the kiddie pool?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  And water started going all over the bathroom.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  We have a hose that goes from the faucet to the bucket.  Yeah.  We turned the water on and it was going through the hose,  but a lot of it was coming out of some pipe underneath the sink. 
[29:30]
 Some pipe.  Some pipe underneath the sink.  So that's where we stand right now.  We can't figure out how to get the water into the bucket.  And then we're going to take the bucket and put the water into the kiddie pool, right?  Right, Spaz?  I'm thinking just go from the faucet,  straight from the faucet to the bucket, and then carry the bucket over to the pool.  Ooh, that's...  Wow, look at that.  That's not a bad idea.  A command decision being made.  Are you making an executive decision on this, Spaz?  Yes, but the only problem...  You have decided that we should just take the pail and fill it up directly from the faucet, right? 
[30:00]
 Yes, but there's one problem.  When you fill up the bucket totally and you try to get it from underneath the faucet again...  You dump half the water out.  Yes.  So to save time, just fill the bucket up halfway.  Yes.  Because then the time saved filling up the other half,  just have it dumped down the drain, will be saved.  Stinky, do you have any thoughts on this to make it go any slower?  Any ideas, maybe?  Maybe you could help out?  Maybe you could upstage your boss, Spaz, here. 
[30:30]
 I don't know, I think Spaz actually had a pretty good idea.  Yeah?  Look at him kissing the boss's ass.  Oh, the boss.  Give me a break.  All right, so when do you think that the filling of the pool will commence?  We're thinking soon.  Soon.  We're thinking soon.  So your schedule says soon.  Soon.  Within a half an hour, I'm thinking.  Do you realize this girl will be here and the pool has to be filled with warm water, hot water?  Yes. 
[31:00]
 How long do you think it's going to take once you start filling it?  I'd say maybe about 20 minutes, but the water will cool down by the time she gets here,  so we'll have to probably refill more hot water.  Physics with Spaz.  Evaporation is a cooling process in which...  And we gotta tell our faithful listeners there's going to come a time when Aunt and I have to step aside  and allow the youngsters of radio to take over, and here they are, Spaz and Stinky. 
[31:30]
 That's the only reason they work for our radio show.  It's a joke!  They are hoping someday, Anthony, to follow in our footsteps.  Okay, terrific.  All right, great.  All right, well, this is...  Wow, this is quite a job for you, too.  There's no hose or anything that can just be taken from the... 
[32:00]
 That's what we just tried.  This is a radio station.  They don't have hoses.  Oh my God.  All right, well, why don't you guys go figure it out?  There are one, two, three, four, five guys trying to figure out how to get the water into a kiddie pole.  The bathroom is maybe 10 feet away.  They have to move water 10 feet.  Have you ever seen the Great Pyramids over in Egypt?  Of course.  Do you know that they pulled stones from God knows where and built pyramids without any technology whatsoever? 
[32:30]
 Put a little perspective on things.  Well, they didn't have retards built in them thousands of years ago.  Now we're having a dilemma moving water 10 feet into a kiddie pole.  It's a serious dilemma.  They're all running around trying to figure it out.  They're serious.  They're really having a problem figuring out how to fill a frigging kiddie pole up.  Get Steve in here from the unofficial website.  Steve, what the hell is going on out there? 
[33:00]
 You have more of a brain than both those guys combined.  It's like a meeting at the Corps of Engineers.  Yeah, yeah, the Army Corps of Engineers trying to figure out how to build a bridge.  They've got buckets.  They've got waste baskets.  They've got little pieces of plastic latex tubing that you use to hold a lot of electrical cords together.  And there's water everywhere.  It's great.  The place is going to be soaked.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  We just want to get the water in the thing.  How are you going to get it out?  That's another thing. 
[33:30]
 And we don't have a low area for a siphon.  You're going to have a couple hundred gallons of water in this thing.  They're going to have to bucket it back into the bathroom.  That's right.  If Stinky gets a little on him, that won't hurt either.  Too funny.  Just a simple little thing we wanted to do for the show.  And I don't know if it's going to happen.  All right, Tony, you're next on WNAW.  Tony?  Yeah, how you guys doing, ONA?  Good.  What's up?  I've got a big FU for spasms and stinking because if I don't get to hear this today, I'm going to be really pissed off. 
[34:00]
 No, we'll pull it out of our butt somehow.  It's not looking good right now, but Rick feels confident.  I hope so.  I really got to hear her.  I want to come down and watch her.  Well, no, we're going to get some video on the unofficial site.  There you go.  All right.  Indication now.  Thank you, Tony.  Rick, everything under control out there?  Under control.  Holy smoke.  I've taken the two retards. 
[34:30]
 Retards.  Retards.  For lack of a better term, it's special ed class out there today.  Amazing.  I've taken them upstairs.  I showed them a big dump sink that they can use that has hot water.  Wait, upstairs?  Upstairs.  Holding.  Now they're going to have to bring water from upstairs down the stairs.  That's why we have Steve here with video.  Into the pool.  Through a couple locked doors.  Yeah.  Instead of transferring the 10 feet from the bathroom we have right next to the kiddie pool.  Oh, boy.  I just see disaster. 
[35:00]
 I see someone just falling down the stairs and water going everywhere.  I just saw them.  They're carrying big buckets of water in there.  This is how they used to put fires out in the 1800s.  Yeah.  It is.  They have like a bucket chain.  One guy is upstairs and they're just passing the buckets down.  It's down the hallway.  If this building ever goes up in flames.  What?  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on WIOW.  Tony, what's going on?  How are you, Mike?  Good.  This can't be real. 
[35:30]
 Put one of those idiots on the phone.  Seriously.  This is really pissing me off.  It's real.  They can't figure it out.  Now they're getting water from upstairs and bringing it downstairs to fill up the pool.  Can they hear me?  I mean, they're in the room.  Can they hear me?  No.  This is ridiculous.  You need to freaking hire me to talk to these morons.  Get them on the phone.  I want to talk to them.  If you call back after break, we'll get them in the studio for you, Mike.  All right.  I'll call you back.  All right.  Call.  Thank you.  Good night.  Everyone's very pissed off.  Well, they're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming. 
[36:00]
 They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming.  I'm trying to fill up the Kiddie Pool.  I can't.  I'm trying to fill up the Kiddie Pool.  I got a great idea.  There are people out there that would kill for Spaz and Stinky's job. 
[36:30]
 Yeah.  I would.  All right.  I'm listening.  I wonder if you guys can do me a favor.  Sure.  I haven't heard the Four Blown Aids song yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The song that started the Most Defensive Song Contest.  Right.  Because, I mean, like, I don't know.  I listen to the show two to seven every day, but I just miss that.  All right.  Let's play that for you.  All right.  I'm listening to the show.  I'm listening to the show.  I'm listening to the show.  I'm listening to the show two to seven every day, but I just miss that.  All right.  Let's play that for you.  All right.  All right.  Can you leave me on hold for it?  Because I'm not in the car right now.  Yeah. 
[37:00]
 Hold on.  All right.  Great.  I think we can do that, right, Ed?  Sure.  You want to explain the Four Blown Aids song, just in case people weren't listening when  all that went down?  Well, we had Stephen Lynch in and Jay Moore and Mike DeNicola.  DeNicola was a good guy.  And I don't know how it started.  Mike and Jay Moore started penning a tune called Full Blown Aids.  I think they were pissed off that Stephen didn't have any new songs.  And he goes, well, I'm writing them.  And Jay Moore was like, well, how hard could it be?  I'll write one, Full Blown Aids. 
[37:30]
 So him and Mike wrote Full Blown Aids.  And Stephen, after a little bit of prodding, like a half hour of saying, sing the God damn  song, performed it.  So we have a version of Stephen doing the composition by Mike and Jay Moore.  Full Blown Aids.  And Stephen Lynch did not write this.  He's very paranoid about that.  Make no mistake.  This is the only version out there.  There is no other version coming along.  Oh, no.  There might be a bootleg somewhere.  Yeah.  So.  This is it. 
[38:00]
 And this is the song that started it all, as far as the most offensive song contest,  all right?  All right.  So let's play it now, Anthony.  Yes.  We like to refer to it as FBA.  Yeah.  All right.  This is called, what is this called again?  Authors of the song.  Jay.  Jay, what's this called?  It's called Full Blown Aids.  Down to my target weight.  A coma has popped out all over my face.  I lost three teeth and all my friends.  Looks like I'm nearing the end. 
[38:30]
 I used to tell a lie or even fib when you're lying in bed counting all your ribs.  I tried to give blood, you showed me the door.  I went to stand up and I fell on the floor.  It's full blown.  Damn that whore. 
[39:00]
 Damn that whore.  I said damn that whore.  Damn that whore.  All right.  That was a shame to be ashamed of yourself.  Jay and Mike.  I can't believe you would play a song like that.  That's probably the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life.  Jay and Mike just reading what they wrote in front of me.  Yeah, and everybody knows who wrote Living La Vida Loca.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer and I've been up since like a lot of them. 
[39:30]
 Oh, I don't know yesterday.  The only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is don't be an Anthony.  I'm talking in 1027 and EW.  Hammer, I'm going to pee.  I can't even believe these were on.  He's a disgusting little man.  I'm going to be brought a douchebag.  Train wreck radio.  Stand over. 
[40:00]
 This is sicker than Faces of Death.  All right, it's FU Friday.  2127571027.  I'm so excited that we get it here.  Yeah.  Anthony's back in the studio.  He had to go check out the filling of the kiddie pool.  Dude, I'm roaring out there.  If there's anything you could add.  Of course, real fast, we've got Smelly Karen coming down for a sponge bath, a soapy sponge bath.  We're going to show her how to clean herself with some hot babes that want to sponge her down. 
[40:30]
 And there may be some lesbian for a date stuff happening today.  And we need this kiddie pool filled up.  And we have spaz and Stinky.  And they're just walking around clueless.  All I could say is it looked like, remember maybe the last season of Little House on the Prairie  when the blind school burnt down and the blind kids were trying to throw the buckets of water on the school?  Oh my God.  I swear to God. 
[41:00]
 That's what it looks like.  What a reference.  Spaz and Stinky trying to fill up this.  So wrong.  They're tripping over this.  Two of the most gangliest guys I've ever seen.  Big, tall, with the clumsy.  It's amazing.  I'm amazed at anyone who's getting in the pool.  Yeah, instead of the blind school, it's more like the retard school is burning down.  And they're trying to put it out.  Oh, hey, Stinky. 
[41:30]
 I got this one.  Oh, it's all over you.  I hit you with the water.  Oh, no.  We could do an hour of radio on this.  I'm telling you.  Stinky and spaz filling a kiddie pool.  You getting footage of that, Steve?  Because it's just, it's pathetic.  Well, because they're using a dump sink on the ninth floor, I guess.  Yeah.  And I taped the journey from the sink all the way down.  The kiddie pool journey.  There are like four doors, I think, can't see what the spaz and the kiddie pool go through. 
[42:00]
 Do we have any bubble bath or anything, Rick, that we could add to the pool yet?  Yeah, actually, we got a whole box of stuff yesterday from Nancy and Lee, who work for the company that makes Lever 2000.  They sent us underarm deodorant, baby bath, toothbrushes.  Didn't she say she used Lever?  Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  Lever, all right.  Well, maybe she doesn't use it well enough.  They sent us tons of stuff to make sure this girl does not stink when she leaves.  Look it up.  Now they're, look at spaz struggling with that bucket. 
[42:30]
 It's just getting kind of heavy.  Well, the bucket's huge.  That's a lot of water.  Here, Steve, go get spaz real fast before he runs up to get another bucket of water.  You know what I found?  The bucket's a lot heavier.  Bring it down and it is off.  Spaz, you're sweating like a pig.  How you doing, man?  You all right?  Still having a quarter full yet.  Hey, how about a microphone?  You have a microphone.  You did a little college radio in your day.  Yes.  A little bit.  Go ahead.  For years.  Doesn't sound like it.  It's not even a quarter full yet. 
[43:00]
 At the soon to be NCAA champs, Iona College.  That's my prediction.  You guys are on drugs.  So spaz, how many more trips do you think?  Many, many more.  It's not even a quarter full and I've made at least six to eight trips.  Both me and Stinky together, so that's about 16 trips in a quarter full.  16 trips?  How many gallons do you think that holds, the bucket?  Stinky.  Is that a two gallon bucket?  Stinky, get on my show.  How you doing, Stinky? 
[43:30]
 It's a little rough with the garbage can.  Spaz has got a handle and everything.  I got a...  Well, Spaz is the boss.  He gets the nice bucket with the handle.  And he has to use the waste paper basket.  He's got to hug it like a baby as he's bringing it down the stairs and sloshing all over the place.  That's great.  And it's nice and warm.  It's almost hot.  Yes, it's very hot.  For the girl, good, because we don't want her getting too cold.  But the water is going to be cold by the time we're done.  Well, that's okay. 
[44:00]
 We understand that.  Just make sure...  And what's the scientific principle behind that, Spaz?  It's because warm water cools faster than cool water.  Right?  You see, Tennessee.  Warm water cools faster than cold water.  It does.  And whoopee!  Okay, terrific.  See, what I'm saying basically is like 80 degree water is going to cool faster than 50 degree water.  But what if 50 is...  Fast? 
[44:30]
 No, no, no.  Doesn't it depend on ambient temperature?  And isn't 50 degree water already cool?  Yeah, but what I'm saying is...  Relative to room temperature.  Unless we want the two waters to reach 32 degrees, right?  Celsius.  Then if one starts at 80, the other one starts at 50, the 80 is going to reach 32 before the 50.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Where did you learn that?  I learned that in science class.  You did?  So...  And what is that?  Some kind of temperature, momentum that builds up?  But Spaz...  Laws of physics. 
[45:00]
 But Spaz...  Laws of physics.  Don't break them.  Aren't the odds good though if the water in the kiddie pool is 90 degrees, that by the  time smell of Karen shows up that you can almost guarantee that it's going to be over  50 degrees still?  Yeah, give or take a few.  All right.  So why would you fill up the kiddie pool with 50 degree water knowing that it cools slower  at that temperature?  Well, it's going to probably only go down probably a few degrees by the time Karen's  done with her bath.  If you put in 50, but if you put in 80, it's going to do a rapid cool down while she's 
[45:30]
 in there.  Rapid cool down due to my calculations.  Which couldn't close the cold.  See, the electrons around the hydrogen molecule in the water...  Oh my lord.  That is amazing.  All right, and have any of the girls arrive that are going to sponge down Karen?  They're on their way.  They're on their way, okay.  Hydrogen with an atomic number of one...  Hold on to your...  Is the first in the periodic table of elements.  If you take the hydrogen molecule with the oxygen, it makes water. 
[46:00]
 As we like to call it, H2O.  H2O.  It's water, boy.  Gungan in.  Good boy.  By the way, Spazz was in charge of getting the girls for today's festivities.  This is just going to be a mess.  They're on their way.  They're on their way.  They're very, very hot.  They're very hot.  Yes.  And they're willing to sponge down to smell the girl, right?  As hot as the water.  They're hot, and they tend to cool down in room temperature.  All right. 
[46:30]
 Do you guys know how to put bubble bath in the water?  Yes, just read the directions.  I feel like we need to be careful.  More than a capful.  More than a capful.  And then you've got to slosh it around, but not until...  Why don't we have Spazz read the directions on the bubble bath?  Yeah, get the bubble bath.  Get the bubble bath.  This is great.  You know, I went to this school, Fifth Avenue Elementary School in Northport,  and for some reason they had the retarded kids in with us.  You know, it was sort of a...  So you know that feeling.  Yeah, one of the programs where they call it mainstreaming, I think. 
[47:00]
 And I'm reliving it right now.  There was a big kid with water on the brain,  and his head was twice as big as anyone else's,  and it used to almost fall, like he'd try to hold it up in a...  It would swish around.  I'm getting that same feeling.  Like we're in special class with the retarded children.  What temperature water?  Read.  Spazz, read the directions on the back of the bubble bath.  It says pour it into running water to create a rich, luxurious,  foaming cream bath for adult use only. 
[47:30]
 So we should run down the stairs with the water?  So that's running water.  My thinking is that while I pour the water,  Stink, you'll just pour a couple of keffles in it.  Oh, teamwork.  Look at that, working together.  Wow, this is amazing.  Boss and student.  The master and his student.  I am the master. You are the student.  They are sharing a brain.  And it still doesn't make one.  Appreciate that.  All right, well, good luck, Spazz.  Surprised about connecting at the head. 
[48:00]
 Oh, we ought to do that, conjoined spazzes.  One day just duct tape them together, make them work.  Conjoined spazzes.  Let's do conjoined spazzes.  Come on, it's fun.  We'll duct tape them together for a whole day.  Conjoined spazzes.  We just need a big shirt and we're there.  That'll be hilarious.  They'll have to like...  And then you tape their inner legs together.  Yeah, they've got to work as one. 
[48:30]
 So the one guy has to use the right leg,  the other guy has to use the left leg.  We're conjoined spazzes.  I want to pursue a career as a country singer.  And he wants to be an architect.  Mark it on your calendars.  Monday show, conjoined spazzes.  A science teacher wants to tell everyone that Spazz  doesn't know what he's talking about.  What's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Is Spazz a graduate of high school?  We believe so, yes.  You're going to call him on that temperature  with the freezing, right? 
[49:00]
 That is absolutely wrong.  I know it is.  We know it's wrong, too.  He's a moron.  That's some kind of rumored science urban legend  that people say warm water freezes before cooler water does.  If you put in 80 degree water and 40 degree water  in the freezer, the 80 degree water freezes first.  It doesn't happen like that.  Right.  It all cools down at the same degree.  I know.  He thinks some kind of a temperature momentum builds up  as it goes.  It's going to pass it.  He's just retarded.  Here comes 80.  Pass it. 
[49:30]
 Whoa, look at that.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Brian.  Love your show.  Thank you.  He doesn't understand things about constants in the universe.  There are certain things that are constant.  Like the speed of light is a constant.  And Spazz being a complete frigging idiot is a constant.  Listen, a lot of people call it up just to call Spazz a moron.  We already know that, so please hang up so we can get on to other things.  Massimo.  Did he put 50 degree water in here, he said?  Yeah.  He said it would cool?  Yeah.  So it wouldn't cool.  It's always got to go to room temperature no matter what temperature. 
[50:00]
 I know.  We all know.  You'll see the 50 won't cool as fast as 80.  It'll still be cool, you hear?  By the end of the day, it's all going to be 70 degrees.  I know.  In my world, it gets warmer.  All the people call him to say Spazz is a retard or a moron  or that you're embarrassed because you're an Iona grad too.  Please hang up.  We're going to get on to other things here.  All right?  We've got to take a break.  For the whole show, we're featuring all the most offensive songs  that we have received. 
[50:30]
 Contest, really heating up now, the most offensive song ever written contest.  Yesterday, I mean, my God, the Baby Raper song just ran away with it.  I didn't think it was going to take the lead over Killifetus.  I think because it's catchier.  It's a catchy tune that you find yourself humming.  Humming.  Yeah.  Well, humming at the playgrounds.  Well, I mean, we're going to do the contest for another couple of weeks,  and then we're going to get the best entries, and we're going to do a road show,  and you guys are going to get to perform them live in front of our sick listeners, 
[51:00]
 and then the listeners are going to finally decide which was the most offensive song.  It's going to look like Showtime at the Apollo.  A couple of people get up there and really hate it and pull them off of the hook.  Yeah, well, that'll be all right.  This was the second song sent in by the Baby Raper guy, Jeff, I believe, AKA Fuel, right?  Right.  This was his first entry that wasn't as good, obviously, as Baby Raper.  But I got to tell you, this one is very offensive, and it grows on you after a while. 
[51:30]
 This is called How Much Is That Darkie in the Window?  1, 2, 3, 4. 
[52:00]
 I'm going to California, and I need someone to home alone.  If I dive that darkie on a long chain, he can get the job done while I'm gone.  How much is that darkie in the window? 
[52:30]
 The one with the long dangly arms.  How much is that darkie in the window?  I've got things need pickin' on my arm.  I have a wife, what needs a beatin'?  But I can't afford to go to jail. 
[53:00]
 If I make my darkie do it for me, I can't give what's comin' that well.  How much is that darkie in the window?  My team could use a new H. 
[53:30]
 They say that darkie don't get cocaine.  I can't afford to rehab his whole race.  How much is that darkie in the window?  They say that darkie is for sale.  How much is that darkie in the window? 
[54:00]
 Don't make me pay extra, cause he's male.  The OP and Anthony show.  Okay, terrific.  OP and Anthony, who would you rather nail?  I disqualified myself cause I got them both.  1027 WNEW. 
[54:30]
 It's FU Friday with O&A.  Finishing the week of radio off in style, Anthony, huh?  It's FU Friday and we're not getting many good FUs.  If someone did you wrong this week, we could tell two million people for ya.  All you have to do is fax the info at 212-957-9639.  That's the best way to do it, right, Ant? 
[55:00]
 Yeah.  We're taking your votes for a bit of the week.  Lots and lots of things to choose from this week, that's for sure.  Oh yeah.  The dice getting a lot of votes.  Oh yeah, yeah, I did have the dice on, didn't I?  The ass exam by Ed Wynn is getting a lot of votes.  Charlton Heston getting a lot of votes.  Yeah.  The Jamaican diarrhea bit getting lots of votes this week.  And of course the most offensive songs that came in. 
[55:30]
 They were wonderful.  But that's a given.  We're going to play both Killifetus and Baby Raper later on today on the show.  And I guess Smelly Karen has a ride for her sponge bath.  All right.  How does she smell?  Yeah, we told her not to shower.  I don't want to smell her, man.  Jim, what's going on?  What's up, man?  That darky song, man, is putting me to sleep.  Yeah, you didn't like that one?  No, no, I think the kitten is more offensive, but...  Yeah, well, that one's not in the running anymore.  I mean, even Jeff, the guy who wrote it, said, yeah, I know. 
[56:00]
 That one wasn't as good as the other one he came up with.  Yeah, that's cool, man.  Not every song the Stones writes is a huge hit.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, exactly, man.  You got to hear the other...  You guys are great, man.  You got to hear the other song the guy came up with that you haven't heard it yet.  I missed it yesterday.  I was going nuts trying to hear it.  I missed it yesterday.  You want to hear something very, very offensive.  You keep listening to this radio show today.  I will, as I do every single day.  All right, Jim, thank you.  All right, guys.  All right, guys.  All right, let's go to James.  James, you're next on N.E.W. 
[56:30]
 What's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, a couple of things.  I wanted to say Baby Rape was definitely the most offensive song.  That thing was...  Oh, my God, my friend, he told me about the Kill a Feeder song.  And he called me up and he's like, I missed it at first, so I taped it.  Then I go back and Baby Rape comes on.  He missed that.  I played it after him today.  He started crying, guys.  That was hilarious.  Well, we've decided that we're going to get all the finalists, and they're going to perform  their songs live at the next road show.  Yeah, you guys should do a poll on the unofficial website to see who wins. 
[57:00]
 Well, no, I think we want to do it in front of everybody, you know, at a road show.  It would be cool to see these guys perform live and stuff, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  One other thing, though.  My friend, right, he has a wow sign in school, a load of us do.  He just got called down to Dean yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he got in a load of trouble.  They didn't even know what it meant.  One teacher found out what it meant, told the dean, and he gets in a load of trouble  for it.  And in a few weeks, everyone's going to know what wow is again.  So all right, James, thank you. 
[57:30]
 Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Everyone's pissed off on the instant feedback that the spaz cam is upside down.  Is it really?  Yeah.  It's broadcasting upside down.  We were trying to get a shot of the pool outside the studio door, but the cord on the spaz  cam isn't long enough, I don't think.  How are we going to get out there?  How much more room I got on this?  Not much, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know, we're just trying to...the listeners want to see what the pool looks like  and stuff.  What we're going to have to do is move the...maybe move the computer. 
[58:00]
 And it might give us a few more feet?  Over there, and then we could put the camera outside.  You want to ask spaz and stinky?  Oh, yeah.  Tell them we have a dilemma in the studio.  I mean, we should...definitely.  We're going to move it a little bit?  This is something that should be available for people to see.  You got to see the kiddie pool.  Paul, what's going on?  It's FU Friday, man.  Hey, what's going on?  It's a big FU to myself.  Why to yourself?  Well, I promised I would never do this, but my ex-wife...I see her once a week to see 
[58:30]
 the kids, and we got a little romantic, and I wound up banging her.  Jesus Christ.  You banged your ex-wife?  Yeah, and here's the deal.  About eight months...I'll make it succinct.  About eight months ago, she leaves me because I'm not making enough money anymore because  I left Wall Street, right?  Yeah.  With my big, hairy next-door neighbor.  So when things didn't work out with those two, right, I, you know, still see my kids 
[59:00]
 on the weekends.  And yesterday was weird.  She goes, I broke up with this guy, blah, blah, blah, and she did what she always does.  She...what all women do.  She came on to me, and one thing led to another.  A big boner came out, and...sorry.  I had banged her, and I felt disgusted.  I mean, I felt relieved, but I actually gave her money, so she's a prostitute, and I guess  I'm an imp.  You're a John.  You're a John, yeah.  Yeah, I'm a John.  But anyway, F you to myself, you guys rule the friggin' world. 
[59:30]
 So, is she calling you today?  Well, I have to actually go see her again, but I brought my brother with me, like, protection.  Give me away from her.  And how much child support are you paying her?  I don't know.  Is this a question you need to know for, for the kids?  Is this a question you need to know for, for like part of your...well, I don't want to  get advanced in this.  It's like 400, and then 400 for the kids.  It's not that much.  I can afford it, but she left me because I was a high-priced Wall Street broker, but  when I said after 11 years I'm burnt out, 40 pounds overweight, and going to AA meetings... 
[60:00]
 You gotta love Wall Street.  I said, let me take a job for 45 grand and see if my nice, sweet wife will agree to it  all.  Yeah.  And then we went on for eight months, and then when we downsized and no more actor,  no more explorer, we got to try an 86-gill.  And she banged the next door neighbor.  A big hairy guy.  You know he was hung, too.  So I felt ridiculous.  How much, dude, how much were you making before you downsized yourself? 
[60:30]
 I would say I was close...more than the president.  That's what I was likely to say.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  But I'm very happy now.  I hang out with my brother.  The two of us are decadent alcoholic gamblers.  When the weekend comes, we're very, very good to the kids.  We don't drink around them.  And we take them ice skating, and we go to the planetarium.  I'm a good dad.  So yesterday I broke down and the guy drooled.  No, that's all right. 
[61:00]
 You're cursed there.  That's all right.  But you feel crappy today because you did your ex-wife.  Yeah.  Was the sex good last night?  I was finished in about three seconds.  I made her...I hope I can say this.  I'll be polite.  I made her do like a...  In her bathroom?  You got one of those red lights.  So it was like...  You know?  It was like a little porno action.  And I couldn't have been in there for more than three seconds.  I said, come on, come on. 
[61:30]
 Red...  All right, all right, all right.  Move your cheeks around.  Tickle them.  And that was all I needed.  But hey, after eight months, it worked for me.  So you haven't been sleeping with any other girl since you broke up with your wife, I'm assuming, huh?  I guess.  Now, you're not going to believe this, but it's absolutely true.  The second week after she...  The second week after she...  Turn down your radio, Dave.  You're getting distracted.  Go ahead.  Continue your story. 
[62:00]
 The second week after...  This is ridiculous.  The second week after I found out that she was growing the next door neighbor, I sought out his wife and met her.  Fine date.  Yeah.  The most horrible, ugliest pig.  But I did it anyway.  Because I got revenge, man.  Wow.  It was disgusting.  What a mess.  You know what?  But I'm happy now.  You know why?  Because I got you guys to at least get me through the day.  There you go.  As long as you have us.  Well, Paul has a big F-U to himself for banging his ex-wife. 
[62:30]
 Right.  Love to my brother Johnny Balkans out there.  Thanks, guys.  You rule the world.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Love you.  There he goes.  See you, pal.  Bye.  Burnt out Wall Street guy.  Speaking of Wall Street, how did we do today, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  You know something?  We must be having a busy show.  You haven't checked the wards.  Yeah, really.  No, I dumped out of a couple of things today, Opie.  Yeah.  That's why I haven't really been...  I haven't had to pay attention to the constant ups and downs of some of these stocks. 
[63:00]
 Let's see.  Oh, Dow is down to 81, just about 82.  And the NASDAQ, pretty much unchanged.  What?  Up 2?  Yeah.  All right.  NASDAQ had a pretty good week, huh?  Yeah.  Record territory, as they say.  All right.  Well, we should get an update, see what's going on out there.  Rick!  What?  We need an update.  What's going on out there with the kiddie pull?  We're about two buckets away. 
[63:30]
 There goes the fast cam.  Oh, wow.  Fast cam.  Fast cam just fell off the ceiling.  Holy cow.  Did it break?  No, it's cool.  I'm going to look and see what shot came out of that one.  But we're about two buckets away.  The retards are bringing out the last two buckets.  Karen loves the pull.  Yeah, you like it?  Here comes Smelly Karen.  But she's not as rank as I think we wanted her to be,  so I'm thinking of sending her out for a couple laps around the block.  Wait, take your microphone.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[64:00]
 Yeah, she's got to get sweaty.  You're not stinky or nothing?  So people could appreciate the stench.  No, she has no sense of smell.  She has no sense of smell.  Who's going to get stinky in here?  He knows stink.  He does?  Well, actually, he doesn't know stink.  Get spaz in here.  They're both upstairs.  They're both upstairs?  When the next bucket comes down, he's spaz in here.  Stinky.  Direct underarm pit whiff.  Get stinky in here.  Stink.  Karen, lift up your arm.  Stink. 
[64:30]
 This is some of the stuff you have to do for the show.  Now, smell her underarm.  Get closer.  It's not really that bad.  It's not bad, huh?  It's not bad.  It's the last option to scare her.  Say thank you.  Grab the mic.  Because I got a lot of crap because I was the only one that spoke up because she smelled  so bad.  How bad did she smell last time she was here, Stinky?  You were here.  All right.  I don't want to offend you or anything.  No, go ahead.  It's a little bit too late for that.  You sat on my lap with your arm around my shoulder, and I went home, and I smelled my 
[65:00]
 shoulder, and it smelled really bad.  And I thought it was me, so I checked the other shoulder and didn't smell at all.  So.  So you're saying her stench was on your clothes.  Yeah.  You were humming last time you came in here.  Karen, let me tell you something.  This is coming from Stinky.  There's only one reason why we call him Stinky.  The first time he came to this damn station, he reeked. 
[65:30]
 Oh, God.  Yeah.  Don't feel bad.  All right.  See, that's why we have you in here today, to get scrubbed down.  You're going to say something to me.  Seems that, well, Opie finally dead.  Opie finally offended.  Everyone was smelling you, and I was the only one that spoke up.  Everyone knew.  Behind your back while you were naked and stuff, they're like, oh, my God.  Is Spaz out there?  Spaz, come here. 
[66:00]
 Are we going to get confirmation now?  Spaz, you've got to smell Karen's left arm.  Stinky, no, the other arm.  Check that.  Yeah.  Come here.  Spaz is sweating.  He's been working really hard today.  All right, Spaz.  Are you serious?  All right, get on, Mike.  Oh, God, I'm getting that feeling again.  What's the matter, Spaz?  Stinky said she wasn't that bad.  Well, he's thinking he didn't smell that armpit.  All right.  Wow, maybe it's just a one-arm pit, Joe.  What?  Go ahead, Stinky, smell that armpit.  Smell that armpit.  Yeah, it's a little more raw than the last one.  A little more raw.  That's totally ridiculous.  Can we have her run up and down the stairs?  Her mentality is totally screwed up.  Yeah, we should send her on a flight.  Yeah, we should send her on a flight.  Yeah, we should send her on a flight. 
[66:30]
 Yeah, we should send her on a flight.  Yeah, we should send her on a flight.  I'm going to carry some bottles of water.  Can someone get a cell phone and have Karen walk around the block a couple times?  We'll check in with you guys.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hi, dude, I walk from Penn Station to the door.  We need you to smell a little worse than you are now.  Maybe she doesn't have to walk or anything. 
[67:00]
 Maybe we can have her exercise in here or something.  It would be funny if she just walks around the block a few times.  What do you think?  We should do it.  All right, and go out with the cell phone.  And then they can stop at certain points and take a whiff.  Do we have any sweatshirts we can have her put on to really generate some heat?  I have vinyl.  You have vinyl?  Oh, flannel.  Oh, flannel.  Yeah, wrap her up in Saran wrap.  That would reek.  Who's going to hit the street with her, Psycho Mark or Rick? 
[67:30]
 I'm busy.  Rick?  I'm busy.  All right.  All right, we'll check in with Rick and Smelly Karen as they do a couple laps around the  block before her sponge bath, Anthony, okay?  What's up, Psycho Mark?  We've got a lot of water out there.  If that...  Shhh.  Yeah, we want to talk about what will happen if anything happens.  We know.  The building is going to get pissed at us again.  I suppose they made a little accident and spilled some already on the floor.  Kind of a little out of the bucket.  All right, Rick, get outside.  Right after commercials, we're going to check in with you, okay? 
[68:00]
 And then we're going to get her in the kiddie pool in like 20 minutes.  Did the ladies arrive?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Oh, good.  They're on their way.  All right.  Ant, we got to take a break.  All right.  You guys could vote for a bit of the week still.  Also, featuring all the offensive songs that we have for the Opie and Anthony show.  All day long today, we're doing that, right Ant?  Yeah.  Still to come, Killifetus and the Baby Raper song that everyone's talking about today. 
[68:30]
 People liking Smelly Karen.  Yo guys, Smelly Karen is cute.  She seems to be nicely put together.  From Steven Stanton Island.  Yeah, we just think she'd be hotter if she didn't smell.  That's all.  That's why the sponge bath today.  Yeah.  We're trying to do a service here.  She's kind of cute.  Is she single?  It's an Opie and Anthony charity show today.  They're liking her though?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, so on the way, Killifetus and the Baby Raper song.  But another offensive song from Steven Lynch, Anthony. 
[69:00]
 Yes.  As we feature all the offensive songs on the show today.  Opie.  Opie.  I have water retention.  Opie's on the rack.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Oh, come on.  Opie, what color panties are you wearing?  Only a fag, whatever.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah, that's pretty gay, man.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Why am I such a fad?  Why am I such a fad?  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah, that's pretty gay, man.  Yeah, I want to give Al Roker the rusty tuba.  Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky bra.  Got me.  And it's FU Friday. 
[69:30]
 Still taking your votes for a bit of the week.  The dice bid is in the lead slightly as we speak.  Make sure you get your vote in before we play that.  We'll probably do that after Smelly Karen gets her sponge back.  I'm going to go ahead and get the  I'm going to go ahead and get the  I'm going to go ahead and get the  I'm going to go ahead and get the  I'm going to go ahead and get the

Ah, there we go. 
[74:00]
 Okay.  Very good.  Yeah, go ahead.  To the management over here.  Why?  Why?  They're good.  They have goddamn weeks to fix  your goddamn speaker over there.  What speaker?  You remember that thing, yes.  Microphone.  Oh, he's talking about the telephones.  Three and a half weeks.  Oh, I know.  They've got a bang on it.  Boom, boom, boom.  I know.  They'll figure out the phones eventually.  Yeah.  Ben, any of the girls show up yet?  Nobody here yet.  Spazma's in charge of getting the girl.  Oh, boy.  Spazma's in charge of getting the girls today.  Come on.  I swear to you.  Come on. 
[74:30]
 If this doesn't happen today, there's going to be hell to pay with Spaz.  Hell to pay.  You know, he's taking a pretty big chance taking that responsibility.  I had a few years in the F.E.W.  He took it all the way down.  All right, call a privilege.  We need some girls.  I just said.  What?  I just said, call Laszlo.  Really?  Call Mike for misbehavior and see if he's got anything.  Should we send out the back signal to the privilege, Anthony?  Ben, go find out what's going on.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

[75:30]
 Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Some of the girls have rad health problems.  I'm glad we received this.  He's got 23 pregnant women.  Oh, my God.  We're lucky that we're getting their forecasting from our field like who knows.  We're lucky enough that we have Having having what women have.  I'm our Evan.  Don't just point.  Yep.  This is a different girl.  Spaz.  Me?  Yes.  How old are you?  I'm not going to tell.  It's my岩 pats.  You suck.  This whole thing was a rage.  We had two girls set up as a last night. 
[76:00]
 One girl got sick and because one girl got sick the other one says, well I'm not coming  along so now we're scrambling for backups.  Scrambling for backups.  Oh my God.  Come on, the one that Rick set up isn't here either.  Anthony, what can you do for us?  I'll get on the phone.  I'll be back in ten minutes.  Come on, if they get sick it's not my fault.  Welcome to the world of producing a radio show.  What happens all the time, people back up.  We'll make this happen.  Damn, what's going on?  I was just, I worked at the morning building next door and looking downstairs he's kicking 
[76:30]
 it in the butt and making it run back and forth.  You've got to get a heavier coat on.  Oh really?  You could see Rick working Karen?  Oh definitely.  He's touching the 888 sign.  Fire spas syndication now.  Alright, thank you.  Alright, bye.  Alright, this is good.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's up?  Jeff, what's up?  Jeff, what's up?  Jeff, what's up?  Jeff, what's up?  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, do you remember a bit long, long time ago about that damn boy George song?  Yeah, Karma Chameleon.  Well, I still got that freaking thing stuck in my head. 
[77:00]
 I just want to send an F.U. out to you for that.  Oh well, a lot of people humming Baby Raper today.  The same way a lot of people were humming the Karma Chameleon.  Yeah, I can't get it out of my head.  Alright, well have a good weekend Jamie.  Peace out Dreamweaver.  Peace out Dreamweaver.  Alright.  Rick, Spaz has wrecked a bit.  Yeah, I know.  Rick, back in the studio with Smelly Karen Anthony.  Hey.  Ben.  You know what's funny about this?  Remember how excited he got in the meeting? 
[77:30]
 Like that he was like going to set something up.  Spaz thought he was ready to deliver.  Spaz thought he was ready to step up.  What happened?  Well, we're having a problem getting girls once again.  I can't understand why.  Oh my God.  So we need ladies to show up immediately.  It just never fails.  To our radio station.  It just never fails.  We'll pull this out of our butt once again. 
[78:00]
 Spaz is down the hall freaking out.  I just want to know why Spaz was left in charge.  Well, we kind of threw him a bone.  Yeah, we were hoping.  A bone.  Two girls like on Tuesday or whatever it was.  We were hoping that he was ready for this but obviously he's not ready yet.  He blew it.  This could mean a lot.  He blew it.  No, no, no.  You've got to keep that on.  She's got to shed.  She's sweating like a pig.  Exactly.  Let her shed and then let that stinky smell to see where we stand with her. 
[78:30]
 Now everyone's scrambling trying to figure out what to do now.  Well, I'm going to go make a phone call.  I'll be back.  All right.  Leave it to Spaz.  That's great.  That's good.  Wonderful.  Hey John, you're next on NAW.  Hey, how are you doing guys?  Real good.  What's up?  Listen, I just want to thank you.  You got me laid the other night.  How did we do that?  Well, I was at one of these boring corporate functions that they have, you know, like one  of these RYROD sessions. 
[79:00]
 Yeah.  More importantly, afterwards with the cocktail party and dinner.  So we're all sitting around the table drinking, having a good time, laughing and the topic  of music came up.  I turn around and say, I listened to you guys in the afternoon.  This chick of course for me, who's a fan of yours said, yeah, I listened to him too.  Everything else was laughing, having a good time.  A few minutes later, we're having dinner.  I look her straight in the eye and I say, Mohawk?  Her eyes just bugged out.  The food came flying out of her mouth. 
[79:30]
 Mohawk or triangle?  Yeah.  So she wouldn't answer me.  Nobody at the table knew what was going on.  She caught a composure.  She didn't answer me.  So I asked her again, Mohawk?  She said, no.  I said, triangle?  She said, no.  I look at her and I go, barefoot?  And the table just didn't know what we were talking about except for me and her.  Yeah.  One thing led to another.  We go back to her place and we took care of business.  Ah, very nice.  I just wanted to call you guys up and thank you for the nice keywords there.  How about that.  Hey John, what station gets you laid?  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.

I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  I'm a fan of yours.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, I got an idea to try to save your show.  Yes.  I think you've got to get in the tub there and our spaz has to wash him down. 
[81:00]
 You know what?  Get spaz and stinky in here.  I'm telling you right now, we're going to put a time limit.  Oh my God, no.  We're putting a time limit.  Look at stinky panicking.  You're going in that freaking kiddie pool with spaz and someone's going to be sponging  someone.  If you...we don't get girls down here.  To sponge off Karen, I swear to God, you and spaz, stinky and spaz will end up in that  kiddie pool, scrubbing each other in the gayest scene ever to take place. 
[81:30]
 Just like the scene in...oh God, help me out here.  Tony Curtis, Spartacus.  Thank you, Steve.  Hey, Spartacus.  Sponge me off.  And if they don't do it, they're fired.  Fired.  Sponge me down, don't you know.  Hey, spaz.  Wash my crotch.  Look at Rick.  It took Rick two minutes.  Maybe Rick could spaz on stinky down the list. 
[82:00]
 Look at stinky's heart stop because he really was scared that, you know, it still might happen.  They're stinky.  There ain't no girls down here yet.  Hey, Robert, thanks for that, all right?  All right.  Why would I miss?  What are you going to do?  This is the deal.  If the girls don't come down here to sponge down smelly Karen, stinky and spaz are going  in that kiddie pool and sponging each other down.  Without a doubt.  I'm going to get canceled by the girls right now.  And I'm telling you right now, if they don't do it, they're done.  Done.  Done from this show.  Done. 
[82:30]
 But it looks like we might have some girls coming down.  Yep.  Rick?  Yep.  How many?  Where are they coming from?  Laszlo, Overprivilege.  Oh, they're coming from Privilege?  Yeah.  All right.  He said they should be there within the next 10 or 15 minutes.  I'll throw them in the cabin, send them right over.  All right.  Very good.  We'll save this.  Why is the camera there in front of stinky's face now?  I don't know.  We should have a good camera shot of the pool.  All right.  Well, get stinky back in here because smelly Karen is done working out. 
[83:00]
 We got to see what she smells like now.  Yeah.  Stinky, did you work up a sweat, Karen?  At all?  Yeah?  Karen, talk into the mic.  Yes.  I'm very tired.  What do you want from me?  Wow, she's cranky too.  Stinky and cranky.  All right.  Lift that arm.  Get the nose right.  No, no, no.  Go for the good pit, the left one.  Yeah, we know the left one was right in there.  Closer.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Oh my God.  Where's Spaz?  Make Spaz smell.  He might be down for the count.  You don't know where Spaz is?  Spaz is all depressed.  I just searched the whole station for Spaz.  Oh my God. 
[83:30]
 Did he jump finally?  Did he go to the roof and jump?  Oh, no.  Spaz, did he walk in?  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  He walked in.  Did he walk out?  Yeah, Spaz is all depressed because his segment went horribly wrong today.  His segment.  He was trying to produce a segment.  He produced a segment that went wrong and now he's like he can't be found.  Did he ever go to produce another segment?  I think he finally snapped on us, Anthony.  I'm never going to be able to produce. 
[84:00]
 Does anyone know where I could get a high-powered rifle?  I'm climbing to the roof.  Yeah, we see Spaz fall from the window in front of the window.  All right, well, the kiddie pool is ready, Anthony.  Yeah.  The bubble bath is in there.  Karen reeks and we got girls on the way.  Check, check, check.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  How are you?  All right, I want to give an F to whoever started saying, okay, terrific.  Why?  Because I said it in economics class today to my teacher and he almost tore me a new  ass. 
[84:30]
 Okay, terrific.  You got to say it like that too.  Oh, I did.  Okay, terrific.  This guy yells at everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, it's awesome.  All right, Matt, thank you.  All right, thank you.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Cool.  Yes.  All right, bye.  Bye.  All right, Anthony, we're going to take a break.  We're going to try to find Spaz to see if he's killed himself.  I think he did.  He's gone.  I'm telling you.  He's gone.  I think he can't find him.  He's gone.  Stinky, where's your boss?  I have no idea.  I looked all over the office, looked in the bathroom.  If he doesn't come back, guess what? 
[85:00]
 You might be getting a promotion already.  All right, well, listen now, we'll try to find him, Anthony.  This is amazing.  Spaz has disappeared.  Yeah.  I was producing his segment.  You know, in all fairness, the guy was really excited about his little segment today.  We were backing off and letting Spaz make the phone calls.  He was reporting back to us and eating some stuff.  You know what this is like? 
[85:30]
 Remember when Mr. Brady gave Greg Brady the plans?  And he was supposed to bring them.  Remember?  He threw up the plans and Greg was supposed to take them to wherever the hell Mr. Brady  worked and he lost them.  And what was in the canister instead?  No, that was the other time at the amusement park.  Oh, with the plans.  Yeah, that was the other time.  Oh, I know.  Greg got a job with Mike Brady and he was like a delivery guy and he lost the plans. 
[86:00]
 That's right.  So then to make it up to him and get his confidence back up, Mike had to go crawling to his boss  and say, look, please give the kid another chance.  He's going to be f'ed up for life.  So they give him another chance and what does Greg do?  Loses it again.  He f'ed up again, but then just by luck he kind of got at him.  That's the Spaz situation.  All right.  He was so excited about his little plan, his little segment.  I don't think we should give him a second chance.  He had notes and everything.  He kept checking with them. 
[86:30]
 What, Ben?  He raised his hand in the meeting room.  He said, you could count on me.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that in the meeting with Jeremy.  Our boss is sitting there and Spaz is in there and he's like, I'd like to suggest something.  I can get the girls to Spongedown Karen.  This could be, I am in charge.  I can do this.  Jim on line nine wants Spaz to sniff Karen for cranky ass.  Karen, have you ever gotten cranky ass? 
[87:00]
 You know what that is?  I think I do.  I don't even want to know.  As far as Bill Brady says, Cal Bell Bill, our pal, cranky ass is like if you pop a nugget,  like a milk dud, and then walk about a half mile.  Then all of a sudden, you got cranky ass.  You know, you pop a nugget and don't clean up too well back there.  You got to walk about a mile.  I wouldn't know.  Why?  Because I wouldn't smell it.  She has no idea.  She doesn't know.  Smelly Karen cannot smell.  If and when Spaz comes back here, he's got to check her for cranky ass. 
[87:30]
 No one's ever notified me of having it.  So you know what?  And you're wearing like overalls.  So it's easy.  He could just pull the back out and give a good whiff to see if she's got cranky ass.  That's his punishment.  Then we'll forgive him.  Forgive him?  Well, we have to forgive him.  This is the funniest thing ever.  That Spaz is so upset.  He was so excited about this.  This is better than if it went perfectly by plan there, you know?  It's like telling an eight-year-old that the Disney trip is off.  Like that's how upset Spaz is right now. 
[88:00]
 He's like sulking somewhere.  I don't know where he went.  Weeping somewhere?  Psycho Mark, can you find him?  I don't know, but he's really upset, dude.  We know he's upset.  Rick was riding him pretty hard.  No, is he really upset?  He was steaming, dude.  I thought he was going to rip Rick's throat out.  So where is he now?  I don't know.  Take your phone and try to find him.  He's on the street.  He's probably in...  He's around here somewhere.  No, go find him with the cell phone. 
[88:30]
 I'm serious.  And then call the show.  It's special class.  I swear to God.  Oh, man.  You've got to calm him down.  All right, Anthony, we're going to retire.  We've got to take a break.  We'll try to find Spaz.  The girls are on the way.  The backup plan is happening as we speak.  And Smelly Karen will get her a little sponge bath and maybe some lesbianism today, once again today.  Any girls want to come down?  If you want to come down, she is very good looking.  She just has an odor problem that we're going to take care of. 
[89:00]
 We're taking care of that.  All right, Anthony, also on the show today, we're playing all the offensive songs.  Yes.  We are doing the most offensive song contest.  You still have time to get your song in.  All the finalists will be at our next road show, it's looking like, around, I don't know, mid-April.  And you'll be able to perform your most offensive song in front of everybody.  Thousands of people will be watching you do your song.  All right.  We're trying to play the one everyone is talking about, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's time. 
[89:30]
 We've got a couple more we're going to play today, but what?  Well, we might be looking for a replacement for Spaz.  What's the problem?  His jacket and his bag are gone.  Did you, what did you do?  I heard you were yelling and screaming at him.  Well, he's, I said, Spaz, I thought you had this taken care of.  And the girl started, she got sick and her friend didn't want to come down.  I go, but you've got to make sure this is taken care of and you've got to have a backup.  And then he snapped at me. 
[90:00]
 Oh, he did?  They started yelling at me.  I'm like, dude, don't f'ing snap at me.  I go, this is your problem.  Now I've got to fix it.  Oh, my God.  He just, he flipped.  Spaz's, you know, credit, sometimes things like this do happen.  I mean, you know, you can't totally razz the guy, but.  Well, no, that's why I mentioned to him.  I said, make sure this is all set.  If you need a couple others, make sure you let me know.  We'll have backup.  I got it.  And he said, no, these are good.  These are good.  Oh, my God.  So he walked? 
[90:30]
 He walked.  He walked.  He left.  We've got to get his side of the story.  I don't think he jumped on a train.  He's somewhere around here.  We've got to find him.  He took his bag and his jacket there, guys.  That's great.  Page him or something.  Cork, he's out there alone in New York City.  Jesus.  What a mess.  This show, I swear to God, it's like some kind of goddamn drug rehab place.  It's out.  It is.  He's our own little strawberry. 
[91:00]
 You know, I got to say it.  I got to stick up for Spaz.  I feel really bad for him because the guy is trying to make it.  He's, you know, it was his little statement that it feels so bad.  He was so proud of himself and he, well, it was his first real responsibility for the show.  You know what I mean?  Like he does things and stuff, but this was his first real responsibility that only he  was in control of and it flopped.  You know, he finally mastered the picking up of lunch and we figured he was ready for 
[91:30]
 the next step.  He was delegating responsibility to other people to pick up lunch and answer the phones.  And he finally figured he'd use up a notch where now he can help contribute to the show.  He didn't have to get the coffee anymore, you know.  He graduated to getting the smoothies and what have you.  And what happened?  It all came crashing down in one horrible afternoon.  All right.  Well, if Spaz is listening, he's got to call the show.  We want his side of the story.  Yeah, call up. 
[92:00]
 All right, Anthony, with that, we do have to take a break, but before we do so, yeah, this  is the one everyone's talking about as we do our most offensive sowing contest, okay?  All right.  It's Jeff, AKA Fuel.  Wow.  You'll know the title of the song in a minute here, okay?  All right.  Here it is, everybody humming this today all over the Tri-State area. 
[92:30]

[93:00]
 I'm just an average ordinary man.  Somehow they just can't seem to get.  While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet. 
[93:30]
 Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver.  But sweet and young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver. 
[94:00]
 The youngest cherries always taste so sweet.  I pick my dates up at the Disney store.  When mommy turns away, I go for more.  Sing them songs and tell them that they're sweet. 
[94:30]
 As I slip the little booties off their feet.  Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver.  But sweet and young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver. 
[95:00]
 The youngest cherries always taste so sweet.  Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver.  But sweet and young, they're good enough to eat.  Baby Raver.  I'm a baby raver. 
[95:30]
 Opie and Anthony, those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  1027WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of a commercial break here, but we need the help of our listeners, I believe, Anthony.  We'll put out an all points bulletin.  Yeah, we want you guys to look for Spaz.  Calling all cars, calling all cars, be on the lookout for a tall redheaded retard. 
[96:00]
 Last seen in the area of 57th and 7th.  He is unarmed but completely dangerous.  Yeah, well, Spaz left the show. He's really, really upset.  And we need to talk to him today. We can't get a hold of him.  If you guys see him on the train, what train does he take home?  The Metro North, right?  Yeah, Metro North.  Metro North, he might be near Grand Central Station right about now.  Spaz, Spaz, you have so much to live for. Don't do this.  Spaz, this is Anthony speaking. 
[96:30]
 Please, if you're listening, if you can hear my voice, please call in.  We're worried sick about you.  Spaz, everybody loves you, Spaz.  It's okay. It's okay to make a mistake.  It doesn't mean it all has to end like this.  Please, Spaz, please, please come back.  We really want to... 
[97:00]
 Or we'll punch you in the universe.  We really want to talk to Spaz.  So if anyone sees him out there, please tell them to call the show.  If his girlfriend is listening, please page Spaz and tell him to call the radio show.  We want to see what his mood is, Anthony, right?  Yeah.  We really need to hear his side of the story.  There's rumors that Rick might have berated him in front of 30 people.  Uh-oh, is that true too?  A lot of people nodding their heads going, yes, on that one, Anthony. 
[97:30]
 Who's the... I'd say Opie's the biggest Spaz supporter on the show.  I like the kid, you know. He does a lot for the radio show.  Right. I rarely ever give Spaz any props or anything.  And I've got to say, Rick might have gone over the line on this one.  I don't think so, man.  You can't berate people in front of... you can't berate him in front of people.  Hold on, hold on. The guy that...  Why is he nodding their heads saying you berated him in front of a lot of people?  Because he started to berate me. 
[98:00]
 Right.  Well, the kid's a pervert.  And it's just like, I understand that.  But he's got to deal with the professional real world, which means, you know,  running away, crying, if something doesn't work.  That is totally true.  Spaz, please come back, Spaz.  Everyone misses you.  I mean, Lord knows, you know, there's been bunches of times where I've been totally stressed out.  And I just walk to the other room, cool off, and come back in and get back to work. 
[98:30]
 We're talking about Spaz.  You have to deal with him with kid gloves sometimes.  The kid was so excited about his little segment today.  He ran up and down the stairs like 20 times with buckets of water to fill up a kiddie pool.  He figured out what temperature he needed the pool at.  He figured out how to get the soap suds in there.  He was all excited. He was running around like a little kid, waiting for Santa Claus to show up,  looking at the door, just waiting for the girls to show.  And then he got the bad news that the girls weren't showing.  It practically killed him. Anthony, use the bullhorn again, please. 
[99:00]
 If Spaz's girlfriend is listening, please tell Spaz to call the show.  Spaz, this is Father O'Flanagan. Please, you've got to come back.  Bloody B, the people love you.  This isn't the way you should go out.  Your life is so much meaning.  What are you doing, lad? Give me another beer.  Spaz, if you're in the sound of our voice, if you can hear us, we're begging you, 
[99:30]
 please don't let it end like this.  Spaz, Spaz, Spaz, it's your mom. Please, don't hurt yourself.  I know you're a little angry right now. You're feeling a little rejected.  You're feeling like maybe, maybe you failed. You didn't come through for the show.  Well, those feelings are absolutely true. And right, you did. You effed up.  Oh, wait a minute. No, no, it happens. It happens to everybody, Spaz. 
[100:00]
 Spaz, look, the police aren't here to hurt you. Get off the ledge and crawl back in the window, Spaz.  Come back. Somebody out there cares about you.  Please find Spaz for us and tell him to call the show.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  Friggin' old yeller.  We're in the middle of a commercial break. We'll be back in a few minutes. Stay there. 
[100:30]
 Oh, for your namesake. Can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  These suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  It's FU Friday with O&A.  Hello.  Never a dull moment on this damn radio show.  No.  Spaz is missing. Spaz is missing.  And this is no...  No... S. Spaz is AWOL. Keith the cop's on the line. Let's see if Keith can help us. 
[101:00]
 We're looking for our faithful listeners to find Spaz somewhere out there on the streets of New York  and tell him to call the radio show. He left here very, very upset.  We're concerned for his safety, Anthony, at this point.  Yes.  And we want to make sure he's going to be okay, okay?  And on the phone, Keith the cop. Before I talk to Keith, Spaz may be around the area of Grand Central Station,  getting on Metro North, okay?  Wow.  I'm thinking he actually went home.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He left.  But he's so despondent.  And he does have a pager on him. If anyone knows Spaz's pager number, could you beep him and tell him to call the radio show? 
[101:30]
 All right. Keith the cop on the line. What's up?  You know, under normal circumstances, an adult, we don't classify him as missing.  But being that he does have diminished mental capabilities,  we will make a special exception and categorize him as a special missing.  We're going to get a photo in every car and we're going to have him out there looking for Spaz.  I believe they've dispatched the airbag to the studio. 
[102:00]
 Yeah, blow up the airbag around the building in case he went to the roof.  In case he goes to the roof. All the transit facilities have been notified. They have a picture. We're going to fax it to him.  Any time, he will be returned to the studio.  All right. Thank you, Keith the cop, for your help. Thank you.  All right. There he goes. Keith the cop, friend of the show, Anthony.  We interrupt the opening show of this special news bulletin. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[102:30]
 On this afternoon, we hope and pray for the safety of Spaz, who has been missing now for more than 15 minutes,  somewhere in Manhattan. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We've dispatched the reporters and camera crew to the Spaz compound, where they are holding a vigil for Spaz.  And of course, the Navy ship Grasse has been dispatched to look for Spaz. 
[103:00]
 To the East River.  To the East River to try to look for Spaz. We're all hoping and praying.  Of course, Spaz didn't file a flight plan when he left the building. So we don't know exactly where he has been.  It has been a warm and hazy day. The haze in his head may contribute to him missing now.  Brokaw.  Yes, Opie. Yes. 
[103:30]
 You sound a little woozy today.  I am indeed a little groggy, a little woozy.  Yeah, what's the problem?  You know, I believe that some of these soap products in the pool that Spaz is filling up seem to have gone to my head. I'm a little light-headed.  You're a little light-headed?  Yes.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  The search for Spaz.  As we continue looking for Spaz, 
[104:00]
 a nation is just praying, hoping that they will find him. You know, any condition.  But hoping and praying that they do find him. We are now up to about 16 minutes with no word from Spaz.  You want to go on location? I believe there's a few people with megaphones outside the building.  Yes.  Yelling and screaming. Let's go outside now and see how the search is going. 
[104:30]
 Spaz, this is your third grade English teacher. Remember the time you took that test and got a zero?  And like chewed through your own tongue, you were so upset and ran away. Remember how you felt?  I'm sure you feel just like that now. Please come back, Spaz. We all miss you.  We are concerned with your safety. 
[105:00]
 Hello, Spaz. It is Celine Dion. Spaz, you mustn't ever give up hope.  You must be like the brave rose who clung onto that piece of wood in the cold waters of the North Atlantic  when the mighty ship Titanic sank below the depths of the waves after striking that iceberg. 
[105:30]
 Just think, think of those strippers that were supposed to show up for the show today and not showing up.  Think of them as the iceberg. And the ship, the mighty ship that was your career on the Open Land initial  struck that iceberg and tore open your hull, flooding all of your water-trade compartments.  But Spaz, like Rose and so many others that clung to wood and lifeboats, you must not give up. 
[106:00]
 Spaz, you must come back to the people that love you as Rose did.  Spaz, do you think you are a failure? Do you think you have let the boys down?  You must be a survivor.  Please come back, Spaz. Search out the studio as my husband, Rene Sperm, tries to search out my egg. 
[106:30]
 You must come back. Come back, Spaz.  And now a song for Spaz.  The candlelight visual that is being held now, thousands of candles being lofted in the air,  to the sounds of Celine Dion as we hope and pray for the safe return of our beloved red-headed reed spaz. 
[107:00]
 Not a dry eye in the house as people weeping openly, waiting for some kind of news of JFK, of Spaz, sorry.  Yes, Spaz. We all remember Spaz.  Let's think back, so the sounds of Spaz.  Come on! Come on! Come on! 
[107:30]
 Come on!  Okay, terrific.  I'm getting a little choked up here, Ophelia.  This moment is very touching. I believe, I believe just as people have been asked throughout the years,  what were you doing when Kennedy was assassinated? Do you remember where you were?  I was in the basement of the house.  I was in the basement of the house. 
[108:00]
 Just as people have been asked throughout the years, what were you doing when Kennedy was assassinated?  Do you remember where you were when the man landed on the moon?  You will remember this day in the future, where were you when Spaz disappeared? 
[108:30]
 Spaz! More! More! More! Spaz! Spaz! More!  Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!  Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! More!  Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! 
[109:00]
 Well, the scene here, the scene here, concern, hope, people praying.  Okay, terrific.  Another Spaz sound bite. 
[109:30]
 Spaz, you must be a survivor.  Okay, Anthony, now entering the 20th minute where no word from Spaz, who you may recall walked off the Open Anthony show on the streets of Manhattan and disappeared because of Rick's ranching in front of 30 some odd people in the studio. 
[110:00]
 I believe Spaz felt degraded. That was his last, the report of his last emotional state was being very degraded.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up? I have a special report. We're turning this into a, no longer a search and rescue, but a recovery mission. 
[110:30]
 Is that correct?  Thank you, Dave. I don't know, I'm going to go to line five. Hold on a minute, alright?  There are unconfirmed reports coming in that Spaz has taken a hostage. I don't know if that's true.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  This is Rob from EMS. Check this out, your show is spazzing people out. This guy up in uptown Manhattan, the 30 precinct 155 would say, Nick, he jumps out of the window second floor, people are like amazed, and he starts ranting and raving. 
[111:00]
 He runs back into the building, he limped in. They got ESU and EMS on standby. They're doing a floor to floor search, of course, starting with the roof. Maybe they got to realize what floor he was on.  But that's how your show is taking off, man.  Alright. Well, thank you.  Alright, I'll catch up to you guys soon.  So glad we, I'm so glad we cut off the Celine Dion bit for that.  Okay, terrific.  Alright, Anthony, wow.  Other people saying maybe spaz was abducted by the giant mosquito. 
[111:30]
 The weather is turning a bit warmer.  Let's see. Let's go to Paul. Paul, you're next on any W.  Hey guys, what's going on? I just saw spaz's face on the back of a milk carton.  Already?  Yeah, it says, have you seen me lately? In the last 20 minutes.  Oh, man.  Things are getting bad.  Alright, Paul, thank you.  Later, guys.  Alright, well, hopefully spaz will call the radio show and all seriousness.  We want to make sure he's okay, alright? 
[112:00]
 He had a tough little afternoon today.  Our buddy, our pal, our inspiration, spaz.  Yes.  Where do we stand with the girls and the sponging and stuff?  Chuck's in the pool.  Chuck's in the pool.  What?  Ladies on the way, right?  Ladies are on the way.  Hey, one of the girls who want to be a lesbian for a day too, Tanya, she called in. I guess she was...  No, no, no, she was one of the backups.  Is she coming in?  No, she got into a car accident.  Oh, so she's not showing it. I hope it had nothing to do with spaz. 
[112:30]
 She hates that.  Alright.  But we'll definitely make this work, Anthony, okay?  Okay.  Also, voting for Bit of the Week, almost done. Get your votes in for that.  And Anthony?  Yeah.  Featuring all the offensive songs on the ONA show.  Oh, yeah.  This one is from Billy and Paul from airsick.net.  As we encourage other people to send in their most offensive songs for the most offensive song contest, okay?  Yeah.  What are you laughing at?  Just all the feedbacks and the fuck up.  Saw spaz in a bar with Mike Adams. 
[113:00]
 Jesus, man.  That's pretty funny.  Alright, this one outraged a lot of people yesterday.  Let's play it again and we'll be back. 
[113:30]
 What a killer.  I need us, I just want, can't get out of their cunts.  Please, DNC, suck out little toes and knees.  Back, back, gang, can't hear the little bones crack. 
[114:00]
 Lose, can't juice, gonna pull it till it comes loose.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No anal is okay.  Brainwreck Radio.  The OVN Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[114:30]
 What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day.  Never a dull moment on this damn radio show.  Hell no.  Come on, Spaz, give us a call.  I can't believe he hasn't called.  Even if he wants to just yell at us.  We'll accept that today.  Just today.  But call the radio show.  Well, Smelly Karen's gonna leave soon.  Karen, are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  I can eat where it fits.  No way. 
[115:00]
 I have to meet my art class at the Metropolitan Museum tonight.  What time does that start?  It starts at 6.  I was supposed to be there at 6.  I'm gonna be a little bit late because they're gonna be, give me, 10 minute me-wave out.  We still have some of your artwork.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, this is art history.  This isn't drawing.  I'm not in.  I'm not a finalist.  In your world, art should be history.  I'm sorry.  It's cool.  I'm learning, dude.  Karen, you know what you gotta do?  You gotta do some kind of Giuliani art thing and you'll be... 
[115:30]
 Yeah, like that guy, new artist.  New artist, he did this Hitler thing or Giuliani with some Nazis.  That's what we should do.  What?  Let's just do some over the top Giuliani, Nazi artwork or something.  And then we'll get some press.  Yeah, everybody will be talking about it.  Or press whores.  Yeah, let's...  All right, well, why don't we get her in the kiddie pool?  All right, let's do that.  We got a couple girls who are in a cab as we speak in probably just a few blocks away. 
[116:00]
 A few blocks away.  From Privilege, Stella and Nikita.  Are you gonna yell at them when they get here, Rick?  Yes, Anthony, that's what I do.  You know, it's at the end of the day when everything goes wrong, you guys will yell at me.  Come on.  Give me a break.  Come on.  Can we get her out there?  Let's go.  Let's get something going here.  Get those goddamn clothes off and get in the water. 
[116:30]
 And hopefully, you know, the girls will show up and they'll...  What did you just say?  Thanks, Anthony, I appreciate it.  You lose the clothes, honey.  Okay.  Hey, tell Rick to get us a microphone so we can go out there and check out the festivities.  Is this on the webcam, too?  Yes.  Yeah, I'm looking at the webcam right now.  Now, first thing, get goddamn stinky and whoever the hell else is in the webcam camera line of sight out of there.  Here, Ben, get us a long microphone cord or something.  Tell us, Psycho Mark, to help us out, all right? 
[117:00]
 Get out of the way.  Yeah, because we've got to go out there.  Yeah, let's go to Ron real fast as they set this up.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good today.  I just heard a report.  They didn't locate Spaz, but they were able to find his black box.  Very nice.  That's a good one.  Thank you, Ron.  Have a good weekend, guys.  You, too.  Another train wreck of a radio show, huh?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people are concerned about Spaz, Anthony.  I see that. 
[117:30]
 Steve, what's up?  Hey, guys, I'm really concerned.  This guy, I'm in Jersey.  I'm looking for him.  I haven't found him yet.  But you've got to look at the good thing.  I was able to get through.  He didn't hang up on me.  He usually does.  I've got to ask just one question.  Sure, go ahead.  Can I have his job?  Yeah, everyone already applying for his job.  We want Spaz back.  Guys, I work for less money.  No, we want Spaz back.  No money?  He brings...  I'm adding you?  He brings too much good radio to our show. 
[118:00]
 Where's our Spaz?  Where's our Spaz?  I can do that.  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz, come home.  Spaz.  Okay, guys, one last thing.  An F-U to Spaz.  He's really messing up.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Come on, Spaz.  Call the radio show.  Call the radio show.  Ben, what's going on out there?  Is she getting naked, finally?  Smelly Karen about to get sponged down?  No, she's in the J-More suite.  She's in the what?  She's in the J-More suite.  Oh, she's in the J-More suite, getting ready.  Okay?  Jay Moore would be proud today. 
[118:30]
 Oh boy.  All right.  People, some of the instant feedbacks I'm reading, people just running the gamut of  emotions over the spaz tributo.  Really?  Yeah.  What are they saying?  One guy pulling out of Burger King almost crashed.  I guess the sorrow just got to him.  He says he was laughing real hard, but you know how that nervous laughter gets you in  a time of tragedy?  I'm sure that's all it was.  He's laughing so hard he almost crashed.  Coming out of Burger King. 
[119:00]
 She's in the pool?  Oh, let me see the...  Wait, I don't think...  Say that again, Mark.  She's in the pool.  Oh, very nice.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  There she is.  Is she topless?  What's she wearing?  Hello.  Oh, there's Karen.  How are you, Karen?  I'm wet.  I don't want to touch the mic.  Is she naked?  That would be bad.  That would be good radio, but that would be bad.  All right.  So are you sitting down in the pool, Karen?  I'm lying down in the pool, Opie.  All right.  Are you spinning around so you can face the camera?  No.  Why? 
[119:30]
 Because...  No one could...  I'll face the goddamn camera.  All right.  Here's part two of the saga.  Yeah.  Spaz had arranged it with Smelly Karen that the Spaz cam would not be used, but he never  told any of us this.  What?  Karen, just wet your hair.  No one will know it's you.  Yeah, right.  Just be a trooper.  No one on the website wants to check out...  No one will know it's me.  Oh my God.  I know she's got big, huge baboos there. 
[120:00]
 Come on, you were showing those things on the camera.  What's she wearing?  Melons.  She's got a white...  She's got a white one piece.  Oh, yeah?  Fine.  Fine.  Only for an hour and a half.  All right.  You can hear the water.  Right here.  Oh, boy.  All right.  I'll get the mic outside.  Is this mic on?  Yes.  We're on the radio?  Yes.  All right.  Yeah, we got this microphone.  We are next to the kiddie pool with Smelly Karen.  She's dressed in like a one piece white bathing suit right now, Anthony. 
[120:30]
 Yes.  I see.  You can almost see through it as it gets wet up top.  But what are you doing in the pool with the bathing suit on?  Because I'm not wearing a bathing suit.  Because I'm not wearing a bathing suit.  I'm waiting for the girls.  Oh, she's waiting for the girls.  Yeah, slowly I'm bailing out.  Oh, is that it?  So the second the girls get here, then things might happen. 
[121:00]
 We'll see.  Jesus Christ.  We're standing around.  I don't know.  Standing around.  It's like a muck.  It's like a muck pulling out his junk.  Here, splash the water so we get that on the radio.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Should I dunk?  Yeah, go ahead.  Dunk under.  Jesus.  Yeah, there we go.  Was that a fart or was that the pool?  Did anyone else hear that croak?  Did you fart or was that the pool? 
[121:30]
 Oh, all right.  Well, someone, drop the soap in there.  Here, there's the soap.  All right, wash yourself up.  Start washing yourself up because the lesbians are on the way.  They want a nice smelly, a fresh smelling carrot, right, Anthony?  Yeah, yeah, because she's got to get that under on.  Get the pits really well.  Go ahead, wash up.  I'm afraid of the mic.  There we go.  Oh, don't worry.  I don't want to lecture you.  Just show us your washing technique and we'll comment if you're doing it right or wrong.  Well, I usually soap on my hands. 
[122:00]
 Soap on your hands and then do that.  Do we have any kind of wash cloths?  No, we don't.  I don't think you're doing it right.  I'm just going to put my hands in there.  Soap on your hands and then do that.  Do we have any kind of wash cloths or something?  Is there something here?  Throw Spaz's t-shirt in there.  That's a towel so she could like dry herself off.  That's a snot rag and she can't use that.  All right, she's taking care of her underarms right now, Anthony.  Yeah, I see.  And she should have some kind of a loofah thing. 
[122:30]
 Maybe some kind of exfoliating thing.  I don't know.  I don't think you're washing good enough.  I think that's your problem.  I don't see you really lathered up.  I see a difference between a shower and a bath.  I don't see you really lathered up.  Where's the soap?  She lost the soap already.  Right there.  There it is.  It's right here.  Yeah.  I don't know how you could get all the vital areas that have to be washed wearing a bathing  suit for Christ's sake.  What about the...  Yeah, this isn't porno.  What about the thatch?  That's why. 
[123:00]
 What about the thatch?  We don't know.  Well, why do you guys play house in my house?  If there's any fragrance coming out of that.  I just didn't want to play.  Play what's in your pants right now.  Use the mic.  Use this toaster.  Just pull the top down because you've got to get the smell from underneath the breasts  and stuff.  There we go.  Yeah, you've got big boobs.  So under the boobs almost acts like an extra two armpits.  You've got to hoist those things aloft.  There we go.  Yeah. 
[123:30]
 All right.  Yeah.  See?  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Now this is getting a little better, Anthony.  Don't be bashful.  Soap them up.  No, soap them up.  Soap them up.  I smell like a zoo animal.  Don't I see it.  She's taking a bath in front of what?  Like 15 guys.  This is pretty sick.  All right.  Now where are the other chicks?  They're coming.  They're coming.  I hope.  Now soap up underneath the boobs.  Soap them up.  Soap them up.  Soap them up.  Soap them up. 
[124:00]
 Soap them up.  Like lift them up.  I want to see if there's any like sweat cheese under there or anything.  Okay.  God damn.  That's disgusting.  They were nice and clean.  I got to give her a hug.  There you go.  Just dropping up.  There you go, Mikey.  This is the way to get meetings.  Take your clothes off and take a bath, Mikey.  All right.  She's going under again.  Oh, look how buoyant her boobs are.  That was very nice.  Wait.  Do that again.  Come on.  Don't get all shocked.  All right.  It's like floatation devices.  Come on.  All the way on your back again. 
[124:30]
 Let's go.  Look at Pete.  Move your arms.  Move your legs.  Wow.  Look at that.  Wow.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  They come right to the surface, man.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  They just bob around like a buoy.  All right, and so far, she has cleaned her underarms.  She's cleaned the cheese from underneath the boobs.  She's done that.  Here, they are.  Look at that.  All right.  These are pretty cool.  You see they come out of the butthole and they come out in the butthole.  Shelf great.  Shelf great.  Shelf great.  The pool is making noises when she moves. 
[125:00]
 It's going pfft pfft pfft.  Do you clean between the breasts at all?  Yeah, I guess I just do it.  Alright, time for cleansing of the ass crack.  Stand up and do the ass crack.  Stand up and do the ass crack.  You might have cranky ass, you know?  You don't want cranky ass.  You went through all the trouble of getting in the pool.  You can't have cranky ass.  I don't have cranky ass.  This is a radio first.  This is a radio first.  A girl taking a bath, a bubble bath, in the middle of the bath.  Why? 
[125:30]
 Oh, Steve is trying to get an underwater shot.  Steve is trying to get an underwater shot, Anthony.  She's the most exposed shy person I've ever seen.  What's she doing?  She's soaping up the hand.  And now she's slipping a hand in a crack and washing.  And she's washing her...  Her pfft.  Yeah, now get down the front of that thing.  Here she goes, Anthony.  Soaping up the hands.  There she goes.  She's playing What's in My Pants, but instead of using her phone, she's using the soap. 
[126:00]
 Yeah.  Very good.  Scrub that thing good.  No, no, you need to scrub.  Oh my God.  Is that all you washed that thing?  We might have found the problem area.  A red flag has just gone up.  We might have found the problem area.  A red flag.  You've got to spend more than five seconds.  A little more time down there.  Four to five seconds on that area.  That's what they call an action area.  You've got to work a little extra.  There you go.  Put the whole bar of soap down there.  Keep it down there so you have a bulge in your pants. 
[126:30]
 Yeah.  I think she just found my high school class ring.  She's got...  When she leaves the bar of soap down there, it looks like Celine Dion.  All right, she spent about 30 seconds down there.  Where are the girls?  I don't know.  What do you think?  We've got to wait for the other girls before she gets out.  Any comments from the peanut gallery?  Any comments?  Everyone liking it.  Everyone liking the technique of Karen's bubble bath.  She's done the underarms, Ann.  She's done the... 
[127:00]
 She's under the boob.  She's done the crotch.  All right, now she's working her feet.  There's a film on the water.  A film on the water.  It looks like an oil slick.  It looks like where the Exxon Valdez is.  It looks like the oil slick.  The Exxon...  It looks like where the Exxon Valdez went down.  We finally got the inappropriate bell in.  We got the bell out here.  All right.  Okay, drink it.  All right. 
[127:30]
 What do you got there, Rick?  Some kind of shampoo?  This is a body wash.  Body wash.  Body wash.  Hey, there you go.  Some suave body wash.  Wait, yeah.  Oh, he's dripping it on her real slow.  Oh, yeah, drip it all over, man.  Get her...  Here, lean over.  Lean over.  Rick, you're so inappropriate, man.  Rick just put it down by his crotch and squeezed it,  and it just came flying out at her.  I hit her in the face.  All right, Rick, come on.  Rick, you're just wrong, man.  All right, she's using the body wash, Ant, now. 
[128:00]
 Now she's...  She needs a chick to wash her back.  She needs someone to wash her back.  Oh, Anthony, the limo guy.  Very nice, Anthony.  Very nice.  Maybe that could be the problem.  She can't reach those hard-to-reach areas, Ant.  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out why she smells so bad when she's...  She's soaping up her legs now.  I see you shaved.  That's very nice.  Shaved what?  Oh, your legs.  Okay.  Any hair care products?  Hair care products? 
[128:30]
 Yeah, maybe it could help.  No, I shaved, razor, and soap.  You want to wax yourself or something?  What else does she need to wash, guys?  We did all the areas, the areas it looks like.  Did she do the cranky ass?  We didn't see.  She wouldn't do anything.  Yeah.  I say she gets on her stomach and goes the bar of soap on her ass.  We got to make sure.  How can we judge if you're completely clean?  All right, she's turning over, Anthony.  There we go.  Hey, that's a nice little ass there.  There you go.  Okay. 
[129:00]
 I'm doing this.  There you go.  Just get the soap.  Don't worry about it.  Get the soap.  Oh, okay.  Give yourself a wedgie.  We have another bar of soap.  That's all right.  It's all right.  We have a couple thousand bars.  All right.  She's cleaning her...  Right.  ...bottom of it.  She's getting the whole area.  Yeah.  All right.  See that?  No, that's what you need.  This is...  No, you're not...  You're almost there.  That's another action area.  You're not spending enough time.  No.  Did you wash the taint?  Yes.  In between?  Okay, good. 
[129:30]
 You did.  You got that whole undercarriage.  Yeah, I had a little bar of soap down there.  You know what?  It's like...  You ever look at a car or a truck?  What's the dirtiest area?  The undercarriage.  You got to clean it.  I feel like we're at a public pool, at the kiddie pool, washing one kid's leg.  I don't know what you do on the weekends there, right?  What other cleaning products do we have in the box?  Kid Toucher.  Maybe it's her hair that smells so bad.  No, no.  Hey, maybe it is. 
[130:00]
 I use Suave Strawberry.  Little shampoo?  Yeah, get her to...  Yeah.  ...wet her up her head.  Get her going.  All right.  Because it depends.  If she's using the shampoo, she's got to keep her eyes closed and we could all cop feels.  She won't know who it is.  Yeah, okay.  All right, she's picking out her shampoo of choice.  Her favorite hair care product, perhaps.  The best part is the boobs that float on the top of the water.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  They do.  All right.  Suddenly no one cares that Spaz is missing. 
[130:30]
 Spaz who?  All right, I guess she's picking out a shampoo.  A shampoo.  At this point, Anthony.  Rick, let her apply her own shampoo.  Don't thrust it into her face.  If you're tuning in, we're watching your girl bathe.  Oh, she does that.  She's using a lot of shampoo.  A lot of people freaking out on the internet because we do have the webcam.  Yeah.  Checking out this whole mess.  There she goes.  She's lathering up her head, Anthony.  Getting a nice head of suds there. 
[131:00]
 Look at that.  You got to use the scalp, man.  Yes, you got to rub the scalp.  Of course.  Very good.  That's nice.  I think she's getting clean, Opie.  Yeah.  If you stink after this, it's a lost cause.  A lost cause.  She's pretty much cleaned everything.  She's going to now rinse her head in the soapy water.  Rinsing her head.  She's going down.  There she goes.  Oh, nice.  She's not, but she's not.  There we go.  Now she's getting her hands into it. 
[131:30]
 What a life.  Yeah, Psycho Mark is precariously dangling the mic of inches above the water.  We have like a boom mic set up.  Oops.  A boob mic.  Look, there it is, the shot that we like.  She's laying on her back and her boobs are kind of floating in the water.  Floating above water.  The nipples are above water.  This was no boating accident.  Well, I don't know what else to do.  I think she's cleaned herself.  A conditioner.  A conditioner. 
[132:00]
 She has the conditioner open.  I'm going to milk this.  This is a radio first.  So the other girls come here.  A girl taking a bubble bath.  Taking a bath.  She's completely bathing.  In the kiddie pool.  There she goes.  A little conditioning.  You don't condition the thatch?  I may have a comb.  Hey, do you condition the thatch?  Do I condition it?  No.  Down below?  Really?  You don't do that?  She has a wood floor, Anthony.  She needs polish.  You do?  You have wood floor?  I was going to play What's in My Pants, but you guys didn't want it. 
[132:30]
 Hey, we don't believe you.  Oh, oh.  Prove it.  Yeah, give us a side shot.  A side shot?  Come on.  A side shot of the wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Does anybody have a comb?  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Okay, sit alright.  She needs a comb.  She needs a comb.  Who has a comb?  Still to come on the radio show, by the way.  Bit of the week, Anthony.  After this mess.  This could be it. 
[133:00]
 The haunting tribute to Spass.  Alright, here we go, Anthony.  Alright.  Wood floor.  Wood floor.  Wait, I can't see.  Pull it aside more.  I didn't see anything.  I saw like the upper thigh.  I saw, it looked like a hatchet wound.  No.  Whoa, two more.  The girls from Privilege came around.  Just in time.  Just in time.  Wow.  Hi, nice to meet you.  She couldn't wash her back.  She couldn't wash her back because she didn't have any help.  Let her get in real fast before you leave. 
[133:30]
 Yeah, and then she could help you wash your back.  Alright, get the body wash or something.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Alright, get the body wash or something.  We got two.  And I'll tell you something, no goddamn bathing suit or bottoms or anything.  There's got to be full nudity in this pool for Christ's sake.  Alright, the girls are getting undressed for Privilege, Anthony. 
[134:00]
 Look at, look here.  You guys are so, so smoky, man.  Alright.  I'm going to do this.  I'm the one chicken that doesn't speak English.  Hopefully you don't ruin it yet.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about the class.  I'm talking about my significant other.  I'm talking about my significant other.  I'm talking about my significant other.  I'm talking about my significant other.  I'm talking about my significant other.  I'm talking about my significant other.  Horst.  He doesn't know that I'm doing it now.  Alright, the girls are just about ready to join Smelly Karen who's not that smelly anymore.  Now she's soapy Karen.  Soapy Karen. 
[134:30]
 Psycho Mark, adding that she's almost...  Whoa!  That she's almost bangable and she just splashed Psycho Mark.  Alright, be careful.  Who is the guy holding the mic over the pool?  Yeah, you're crazy.  You will get electrocuted.  Alright, the girls...  They're ready.  Let's jump in there.  The bathroom should be right up.  In the bathroom?  We're live on the radio.  Tell her to just pee in the pool.  All of us did.  Don't be shy.  Come on. 
[135:00]
 Alright, here come the girls.  Wow, they are smoking.  Make sure you get that on the webcam, man.  We have any tunes or anything?  Where's the boombox?  That's alright.  The girls...  Oh my God.  Hello.  We got to thank Lazlo from Privilege for helping us in a bind, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Alright.  Is the water warm?  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright. 
[135:30]
 Alright.  Alright.  Huh?  No, because she's been washed?  The stripper from Privilege.  She's soaping up Karen really nice right now.  The other girl has entered the kiddie pool with the body wash.  They're both topless.  They are applying the soap in a very unusual way.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, look.  Now Karen getting involved.  They're using their boobs to spread out the soap and stuff.  Yeah.  Who do we have?  Introduce each other. 
[136:00]
 That's Karen.  That's Stella.  Stella.  And Nikita.  Nikita, yeah.  Nikita, our favorite.  She's always here.  Nikita brought her own flotation device.  Just in case, you know, the water gets too deep.  Alright.  They're all soapy.  What are we, Swimmies?  Hey, who's got the digital camera?  Alright.  Rick's taking some pictures.  Wow.  Look at that.  We'll show you guys later on.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now there's some washing going on.  Okay. 
[136:30]
 Terrific.  Wow.  They are making sure all the areas we discussed earlier are definitely clean.  Ladies, maybe you want to get the underside of her boobs.  Stand up.  Yeah, maybe stand up.  There you go.  Alright.  And now washing her legs.  Wow, look at that.  Oh, she's using not only her hands, but the cleavage makes a great little wash cloth.  Who knew?  Oh, you got my eye. 
[137:00]
 Oh, watch it.  Oops.  Sorry about that.  That was...  I got my eye.  That was Psycho Mark and that wasn't cream rinse.  Mark's playing pool boy right now with the towel.  Oh, well.  Very slippery, isn't it, ladies?  All three girls getting very friendly with each other at this point, Anthony.  Yeah, make sure you wash her cranky ass.  She might have cranky ass. 
[137:30]
 Oh, they're washing her cranky ass.  Get in there.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, giggling going on in the pool.  You know, I forgot to take a bath today, Karen.  Oh, you did?  It's alright.  Well, look, now you're getting all cleaned up.  Wash her up.  Come on, we'll wash each other up.  People, yeah.  Anthony, the listener's just going nuts.  The webcam is on.  Yes, in full force.  Providing some great pictures right now.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Karen, what do you think about touching other girls' soapy bodies? 
[138:00]
 Whoa.  You like it?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, she's digging it.  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time.  Very long time.  That's something.  Look at that.  That whole thing of body wash, almost gone at this point.  They're just going all over.  I got more.  Hey, Stella, you haven't been washed yet?  No, I haven't.  Go wash her up, man.  There they are, the girls.  Get her all over.  There you go. 
[138:30]
 Here, you can waste that bottle of body cleaner.  Just get it all over the place.  Wash all around her.  There we go.  Wash all around the G-strings because they shove those dollars in there  and you don't know where the hell those things have been.  So you want to clean that whole area.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, you don't want anything getting infected, a paper cut.  Cut, cut.  Okay.  Wow, these girls are getting all soapy.  Oh, look at this move.  She takes the body wash and just gets it all over her boobage. 
[139:00]
 Very nice.  Applying everything at this point.  You know what we ought to do?  We ought to bottle up this water and sell it on eBay.  What, are we stupid?  Let's do that.  Let's do it.  We'll bring it to our next room show.  We'll give out water from the bath.  Yeah, we'll have like 10 bottles of water from the lesbian bath.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Very warm in the air.  You guys want a champagne? 
[139:30]
 Oh, that'll offer a Jesus Christ.  Look at that.  I love it.  Yeah, well, that'll end up in a court case.  If we're still on the air, the answer would have to be no, of course.  Wow.  Yeah, the one girl's really getting into it.  You're getting all washed up.  She's got the two girls working her and soaping her up and cleaning her.  Okay, all of a sudden there's kissing going on.  Yeah, there's like all kinds of kissing.  There's like all kinds.  Karen is like, Karen is really getting turned on by this. 
[140:00]
 Uh-oh.  What is she doing?  I don't know, going down.  It looks like she was bobbing for apples.  Yeah, what are you bobbing for?  There's too much soap.  There's too much soap?  Okay.  Hey, Karen, I don't think, have they seen your wood floor?  No, I haven't seen my wood floor yet.  Hey, she's got wood floor.  You know what that is?  You don't know what floor?  She's got the, she's shaped down completely.  And she doesn't even know English. 
[140:30]
 Yeah, I know.  What am I talking through, Jesus?  She's running through the house.  She knows lap dance.  Oh, look at this.  There you go.  Wow, now we're getting into some serious grand finale action here.  They're both sitting facing each other, legs interlocked.  Oh, okay.  Now Karen is, there's just a massive lesbian team going on right now.  We're going to send this into HBO for the next version of If These Walls Could Talk. 
[141:00]
 There we go.  Wow, yeah.  That's nice.  Screw that Ellen DeGeneres Sharon Stone crap, man.  We got the real stuff right here.  Whoa!  Man, okay.  She is going to town.  Of course, we're taking plenty of video and pictures.  Tastes a little soapy?  Rinse them off before you put them in your mouth.  What are you doing?  There you go.  You got a little bit of water. 
[141:30]
 You got to see this scene, man.  A huge kiddie pool.  Hey, can one of you girls stick your nose in her armpits to make sure she's clean, for God's sake?  Yeah, they're pretty clean by now.  Give it a spell.  Oh yeah, she's clean.  She's clean, huh?  Okay.  Yeah, good.  These armpits are clean.  They're now like, yeah.  A lot of rubbing, a lot of scrubbing.  A lot of touching.  Now they're really getting, I think they know each other a little better now.  Karen is really into this, man. 
[142:00]
 See, she forgot all about art class.  Yeah, exactly.  I got an art exhibit in my pants.  Yeah, man, today's shocking.  Oh, wow.  They are amazing.  Wow, look at this.  A little kissage going on.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  There you go.  A little scrubbing.  Okay, terrific.  The hands and mouths coming into play. 
[142:30]
 Yeah, watch you don't lean on the back of that too hard.  This pool is about to be a mess.  One of the girls leaned on the side of the pool and the water almost came out.  Very close that time.  Oh my God.  Taking on water.  You must be a survivor.  The most flooded all the watertight compartments.  I'll tell you what, I don't think Karen's got a watertight compartment right now.  Hell no.  Yeah, just watch that.  I don't even know what else to say.  This is just one of the best lesbian scenes I've ever seen in my life. 
[143:00]
 Yeah, you just don't want it to stop, you know?  There's a lot more rub.  There's a lot more rubb- you know what it is, as it goes on they're getting more and  more intimate with each other.  We have brought lesbian for a day to the next level, I do believe that. 
[143:30]
 Oh Karen, Karen is like totally into chicks, look at that.  Karen who's your best pal at this point?  Come on!  Don't be an Anthony.  Yeah, see?  We ragged you a little bit, but look, we cleaned you up and we got you two chicks!  Another lesbian fantasy coming true, Anthony.  Wonderful.  Alright ladies, that was fantastic.  We gotta thank Smelly Karen, Stella and Nikita, right?  Nikita from Privilege, two really smoking babes, go see them at Privilege downtown, 
[144:00]
 right Ant?  Yeah, good job.  Alright ladies, very careful coming out of the pool.  There's no lifeguard on duty, they all have boners.  Next!  Yeah, we'll do a bit of the week next, stay there.  Hello?  Hello?  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  Haha, I know that.  OPM Anthony. 
[144:30]
 Hello?  On the way, 1027 WNEW.  And I thought we were all just having fun.  Is someone archiving those pictures off of the webcam so we can maybe put them on the  unofficial site?  You can download, like, yeah, you ever see that?  You can download an entire half hour or hour at a time of all the pictures so people that  weren't able to see it.  That would be nice.  Well, just when you thought you've lost faith in your buddies OPM Anthony, we pulled another 
[145:00]
 one out of our pots today.  Even without spaz.  We gotta thank the fine ladies from Privilege for stopping by and saving our bit today.  Jumping into the little kiddie pool with smelly Karen, scrubbing her down.  Wow, ladies, wonderful.  Yeah, we gotta thank the ladies before they leave.  Stella and Nikita from Privilege.  How do you feel?  Did you guys have fun?  Did you all nice and clean now?  Yeah, we had.  Squeaky clean.  Squeaky clean? 
[145:30]
 Stella's the coach at the moment.  Stella's the coach?  Oh, hi, that's, okay, because we were down there.  I was trying to remember if I saw you naked or not before.  Wow.  I have a present for you guys.  I have nothing to do with them now since they're all wet.  All right, your wet panties.  We'll save those too.  We'll save those.  We'll throw them out to the crowd during the next road show, Anthony.  Well, maybe we'll give them to Rosie O'Donnell and she could auction them off for charity.  On eBay.  Yeah.  We should start our own O&A eBay.  O&A eBay charity.  Just all the disgusting debaucherous crap we have on this show. 
[146:00]
 We're bottling the water, Anthony.  Yeah, we're gonna save some of the pool water for the next appearance and we're gonna give  that away, autographed bottles of the pool water.  Of the lesbian bath.  Well, Karen, how are you feeling now?  Come on, Karen, you gotta like us now even though we said you were stinky, right?  I feel pretty good.  Let me tell you something.  She's sitting right here, like a couple of feet away from me.  I am smelling soap and clean shampoo and conditioning. 
[146:30]
 You smell very good.  And can't take your word for it.  Where's Stinky?  Stinky, get in here.  Stinky was the one who smelled Karen's armpits.  Let's see if they're clean now.  Stinky?  Yep, you have to smell her armpits now to see where we stand.  Let me get it.  Yeah, lift that up.  There you go.  Okay, it was the left arm that was the problem area.  It's very flowery fresh.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  It is now clean Karen. 
[147:00]
 Not smelly Karen.  Clean Karen.  All right.  The artist formerly known as Stinky Karen.  Lesbian Karen.  Yeah, she'd be lesbian Karen.  Jesus Christ, you were going to town in there.  She had two handfuls of mouthfuls and she's going to town.  Well, it's definitely a new meaning to wash your mouth out with soap.  Yeah, see?  You're dirty.  She's got a soapy mouth.  Even though you just came out of the bath, you are a dirty girl.  Yes, you are.  I think she was brushing her teeth with part of Nikita. 
[147:30]
 Yeah, I know.  I know.  I got to check out.  All right, well, let's hear it for smelly Karen.  Normally smelly Karen.  Normally smelly Karen.  Clean as a whistle Karen.  Very good.  And you really enjoy the whole girl thing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I see.  All right, ladies out there, if there's a lesbian fantasy we can make come true for you,  just get a hold of the radio show, okay?  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, that's right. 
[148:00]
 All right, Karen.  All right, well, thanks guys.  Thanks.  There goes Karen.  Karen.  She'll be at our class in about 10 minutes.  She'll go to our class and all of the students will go, you smell so good.  See?  And I guess we got to thank the ladies from Privilege.  But your clothes still stink.  I'm kidding, Karen.  I'm kidding.  And let's hear it for Stella.  Yes.  And Nikita from Privilege.  West 23rd Street on the corner of 11th Avenue.  Great little place down there. 
[148:30]
 Yes, check it out.  Say hi to Laszlo for us and the girls, Stella and Nikita.  All right?  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you for helping us out today.  Beautiful.  We appreciate it.  Between five and eight, free admission and buffet.  They want us to mention, Anthony.  Buffet.  Proper attire.  It's a gentleman's club.  Yes.  All right?  Proper attire.  You can't go there with your schlong hanging out.  I don't like this man.  Oh, man.  Yeah, tell them who you are or they'll throw you out.  Let's get dressed like that.  You're slob.  And the phone's just going nuts here. 
[149:00]
 What radio show shares with their listeners?  Well, that's just it.  I'm reading the instant feedback, which is coming in at a rate I haven't seen in quite  some time.  And people are saying this is the best thing.  I mean, we are giving people...  Somebody said the best radio they've ever seen.  Seen?  Now, what is that?  Well, we try to share with you guys.  So they punched up the cam and saw three girls naked in a kiddie pool, washing each other  and then caressing.  The best bubble bath I've ever seen in my life. 
[149:30]
 That was pretty good.  You know what's funny?  Me and Hope, we're standing outside.  We're trying to give a play-by-play.  Thank God we have the webcam so people can check it out.  But after a while, you realize when something has run its course, we didn't want to stop.  It was like, okay, as far as the radio show goes, we did it.  It was good.  It was a rousing success.  Sure.  But let's keep going for 10 more minutes.  Yeah, because I really don't want to stop.  Because the secret of radio, when you're in one of these things where you have lesbians 
[150:00]
 going at it in a kiddie pool and it's a sudsy and soapy and stuff, the girls will continue  until you turn the mics off.  Yeah.  As soon as the mics go off, they are done.  Yeah.  So...  Don't kid yourself.  They're not here trying to turn us on.  They're here for the exposure and the fame of the whole thing.  So you probably heard a few with, okay, they're scrubbing.  Right.  Yes.  So we're delaying, knowing as soon as we turned off the mics, they were done.  But a good thing we did delay because toward the end, they really started getting more 
[150:30]
 friendly.  Oh my God.  It was a little weird when they first got in the pool, the two girls, with Karen.  They had to loosen up a little bit.  Yeah, and then once they loosened up, Karen loosened right up, didn't she?  Oh my God.  Steve, what's going on?  How did that leave her 2000 face?  Your timing, terrible.  I got screwed.  I got screwed, Steve.  You ain't kidding.  You ain't kidding.  I swear to God, one day I will pay this man back.  We just crashed the NAW website, by the way.  You're kidding.  Yeah, it's back and running now, but it just was getting pounded by our listeners.  It took a lot of hits.  It took a lot of hits.  That's okay, because there will be video and stuff on the unofficial website.  Yeah, but the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera,  the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera,

 Wow, almost done Anthony.  I'm going to go see Lewis Black this weekend by the way.  Oh yeah!  Lewis was in yesterday with the Comedy Central's Daily Show back in Black he's playing the  Stress Factory in East Brunswick, New Jersey right?  Yes.  I highly recommend you go see him, he's got two shows tonight, 8.30 and 11.  And tomorrow night same thing, 8.30 and 11.  I'm going to get my ass out and finally see him this weekend.  Got to.  Cool life.  Because I hear nothing but great things about his standup act and he's a friend of the show. 
[157:00]
 So by the way, Louis, if you're listening, hold four.  I need four.  I might even make a trip down to Paisano this weekend to find him.  Whoa, look at you making the rounds.  Good will, ambassador.  Trying, it's about time.  Feeling good about the radio show, got to go out and celebrate a little bit.  Okay, terrific.  All right, this is what we got left, Ant.  We got to do bit of the week here.  Yes.  And right after bit of the week, we're going to play What Did We Learn on the Ophi and 
[157:30]
 Anthony Show today.  That could be a good round today.  I think people learned a lot today.  Yeah, I do believe so.  So let's do it, Ant.  It was a runaway victory here for bit of the week.  Dice finally making it back into the studio this week.  Yeah, Dice taking a little vacay from the show for a while since he was in here live,  I think.  Yeah.  And oh, geez, he just happened to turn up and he came back strong this week.  Here it is, bit of the week on the Ophi and Anthony Show. 
[158:00]
 Ophi and Anthony.  There's no level two over you guys want to take to.  Being Anthony there in my day, radio was boring all the time and we like it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  Oh, we had a bath.  We had a bath today, right, Anthony?  Yes. 
[158:30]
 1027 WNEW, the O&A show.  We're back live.  Ah, there it is.  Dice bit of the week on this fine Friday.  March 10, 2000.  We have bottled up some of the water from the lesbian bath.  How does it smell?  Good?  Yeah, all soapy, nice.  Smells like clean lesbian.  Yes.  Beautiful.  And we're going to hand those bottles of water out at our next road show.  You know what we got to do?  We got to get like nice jars so we can fill up a bunch of jars with that water. 
[159:00]
 Looks all nice, all sealed.  Have the lesbians maybe even sign it and then give it out.  What a prize that would be.  Imagine that up on your mantelpiece at home.  We should do that.  We'll work on that next week.  Right next to the picture of Grandma.  Yeah.  All right, it's time to play What Did We Learn on the O&A show today?  I think it was an educational show.  Well, we have so many people checking in from the instant feedback.  Let me read a few of these really fast. 
[159:30]
 Smart guy from the island.  Today I learned three sets of boobs and a kiddie pool is better than one.  Rich from Mount Kisco.  What I learned today is that you will drive home from work really, really fast when you  know naked women in a pool are on the spaz cam on your computer at home.  Today I learned that this is smart guy from the island.  Today I learned that any W needs a new server, more bandwidth, and a 30 FPS high resolution  webcam.  F you, F me, F us all because God damn we're a bunch of lucky son of bitches. 
[160:00]
 Let me tell you, we are definitely at the infancy stage of the webcam.  Don't worry about it.  We're checking it out.  I think it's a rousing success.  Yes, it was huge.  But we could use a better camera.  I have a truth.  Ben from Garfield.  I've learned that three girls in a pool make for a Woody in your pants the size of the  Washington Monument.  Pasha from Brooklyn.  What I learned on the O&A show today.  The key for hot lesbo action as prepared by Julia Childs equals one smelly big boob woman 
[160:30]
 with no sense of smell plus two strippers who can't speak English plus a kiddie pool  all mixed in with some marinara.  Also there's nothing more addictive than a catchy tune about raping children.  Jesus.  The soul of nigga Charlie.  No the soul of nigga Joe checking in from the projects.  I learned that Anthony's better than Dyches.  Dan from Jersey.  I learned that Spaz is ready to go postal.  Yeah, hopefully he'll check in on Monday to see what the hell's going on. 
[161:00]
 He hasn't even called.  I hope he doesn't.  Wow.  That's something.  I thought he would have called.  You know.  We'll get to the bottom of it on Monday.  I guess so.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Let's start with Billy from airsick.net.  Billy!  Oh, there he is.  Great radio, dude.  Hey, what's up, Billy?  Hey, look.  I got a name for the bottle of lesbian water.  Trey Gash.  Trey Gash. 
[161:30]
 That's very nice.  A bottle of Trey Gash.  We're going to get fancy labels and stuff, Billy.  Oh, that's real purdy.  You like the genie bottles?  Yeah, we got nice bottles.  Maybe even a little spray top so you could put a little Trey Gash with you at all times.  And walk into it, you know?  A little spray in your crotch before you go to that important meeting.  We're taking this serious.  We're going to bottle the water all nice and we're going to give them away.  By the way, accept no imitations by imposters selling other bottled water on eBay. 
[162:00]
 Yeah, we got the original here in the studio.  Have a great weekend, guys.  All right, Billy.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's see.  The phones are not.  There we go.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  I'm on?  Yeah, what's up?  I learned that you guys rule the airwaves of the whole world, little one New York.  Oh, look at that.  And I got to F you guys because today at school I was humming Baby Raper and almost got it 
[162:30]
 friggin suspended.  Yeah, that song is going to be hummed by a lot of people this weekend.  Humming is one thing when you're singing the words in the supermarket.  If you're there in produce wheeling your little car and you're like, Baby Raper, I'm a baby  raper.  And then I get to the line, the sweetest cherries at the Disney store.  All right, man.  Hey, guys, can you play it one more time?  It's going to be the weekend now.  Oh, no, I think we're...  Please.  No.  We have a tendency of playing our bits to death.  You can put them on the website.  Yeah, yeah, they should be up, right, Steve?  Steve from the unofficial OP Anthony website here in the studio today documenting the lesbian 
[163:00]
 bath, Ryan from Westchester.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  And the Wrangler.  Thank you.  Ryan from Westchester.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  God spaz is like God.  And the Wrangler.  And the Wrangler.  Thank you.  Ryan from Westchester.  God spaz is like Gilligan.  He screws up big time, runs away and has all the castaways looking for him all over the  island.  Spaz, spaz, little buddy.  There it is, like a Gilligan. 
[163:30]
 All right.  Let's get to...  Kevin, Kevin, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned today that I got to kill my wife and our divorce, she took the computer and  I missed the whole episode today.  You weren't one of the lucky ones that was able to get into the webcam.  No, actually I was driving around doing estimates all day for my landscape company and I'm listening  to you guys all day peeing in my pants, man.  It was hilarious.  You didn't learn something from an earlier Opien Anthony show.  Yes, I did.  I actually called up and said, F you to her on the air.
