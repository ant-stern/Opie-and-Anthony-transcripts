 We are off to a flying start here on the Opi and Kool and Inhuman show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, man.  It's the Opi and Anthony show.  Yes.  The Dopey duo.  That's right.  Riding into town again.  for another fine day of radio programming Anthony. 
[00:30]
 Absolutely. You know what? I'm going to say right now, let's get some coffee.  You need coffee again?  Yeah, I've had this goddamn cough and stuff, you know?  Yeah, and I'm sick.  And it's been having a really rough week, but I don't take off from work because this isn't work.  Like I used to take off for the drop of a hat when I was knocking tin for a living.  Yeah, when you have a real job and you're feeling a little sick out your throat or something, you're like,  I get to call in sick. 
[01:00]
 But now it's like, what am I going to do? Sit home and pretty much do what I do here.  Yeah, hang out and goof on stuff.  But you really have to be sick to call in sick for this radio job.  Which I had to do in November, unfortunately.  Like the only way I would call in sick and the only way I did call in sick,  which is going back to when we first started here, is when you can't get up.  You really cannot. You've been so sick where you stand up and you get that fuzzy feeling and you're all woozy.  And you feel like you're just going to topple over. 
[01:30]
 Yeah, that's when you have to say.  That's when, you know, I'm not in because I can't get in.  If I could get in and just plop in the chair, that's fine too.  I'll broadcast with 102 fever. What the hell?  Well, my problem, last time I had to call in sick, I just didn't have a voice.  You kind of need a voice to do a radio show.  That's true. I started losing that.  At any given moment, I could just go into this mode.  I was like, hey, how you...  Packing fleck-um-um.  Fleck-um-um. 
[02:00]
 Well, I hope Mr. Cosby isn't sick today.  Because I think we're going to need Mr. Cosby later on on the show today.  Cos, what's up with the Cos?  We're just having a little fun with the girl.  We'll get into that a little later.  Want to say hi to everyone that had a swim to work today?  Oh, yeah.  Union Square, just an absolute mess.  It's so funny, man.  There are just so many pipes just waiting to explode in the city of ours. 
[02:30]
 Ancient pipes.  They say these pipes are like well over 100, 150 years old.  Yeah.  What lasts that long?  Nothing.  My favorite water main break is when it happens and it swallows cars out of nowhere.  Yeah, big hole in the road.  Cars gone.  I like when it's those goddamn livery cab drivers.  Maybe with their water main break in Union Square, they cleaned up some of those bums. 
[03:00]
 They've got their first bath in 10 years.  Oh, brother.  Well, we haven't said hi to anyone yet.  No.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on today, man?  Thanks.  Hey, Ty.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  You're on the radio.  Hey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Doing well.  What is the deal with Don and Mike?  The show that comes on after that?  What?  I'm telling you.  I'd rather take Tom Lycus for him any day. 
[03:30]
 Why?  No way.  They're horrible.  Dude, what are you kidding?  Tom Lycus?  All right, Tom Lycus sucks, but these guys, beyond.  I lasted about five minutes.  See, that's just it.  You've got to give these shows a little time.  Because you're kind of used to hearing what Aunt and I sound like.  I mean, every show has a different feel to them.  You can't just punch into something.  Because like you just punch into this show, it's just a couple of idiots talking.  But after you get to know us a little while, you hate us even more. 
[04:00]
 Wait a minute, that doesn't work.  Yeah, but where are they coming out of?  They're coming out of D.C.?  Yes.  They blatantly were ripping New York.  They don't like New York at all.  I wasn't getting that impression.  I listened last night.  I was finally able to drive home and listen to a show on the radio.  I was online last night and I was checking them out.  And then I checked out the first part of Ron and Fezza's show.  And I'm like, wow, this is the first time after Aunt and I get off the air that I'm tuning in any W to see what's going on.  Something to check out.  I checked out Lycus the first few weeks he was on.  And it was painfully obvious that I couldn't get into that show. 
[04:30]
 But come on.  But I spent a good hour, hour and a half with Donna Mike and then another hour with Ron and Fezza late last night.  It seems like they've got that typical radio voice.  You know, the one that Anthony always makes fun of, the typical CBS.  CBS.  I'd rather listen to Mad Dog.  Well, you want the goofy, wacky voices.  If you want the goofy, wacky voices, then check out Fezza.  That's a wacky voice.  There's no DJ voice there. 
[05:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you, Tom.  I so far am digging the two new shows.  And I'm not just saying that.  Well, anything's better than Lycus, I guess.  Yeah.  And the radio chick's doing a fine job.  For the first time in a while, we're very excited about working here at any W.  There's things going on.  Yeah.  We feel like there's at least, you know, there's a plan.  There's shows that want to win.  And they sound all right.  I know you guys are going to get syndicated. 
[05:30]
 I know you guys talk about a lot, like, every day.  But come on.  Let's do it.  That's funny, right?  Let's do it.  If we could keep our names out of the paper, I think it'll happen.  Yeah, it might happen.  Unbelievable.  I don't know.  I don't know what the company has in store for us.  We would love to be syndicated.  Be nice.  Be good.  Seems like everyone else is allowed to, but we're not.  But I guess that's fair.  So we'll just patiently wait.  Hey, what's the WWF stock out today?  I got bored.  I'm taking a loss.  Yeah, it took a little dip.  What was it, down an eighth today or something like that? 
[06:00]
 Oh, no.  It went up yesterday.  Your old pal aunt dumped out.  I dumped out.  What, you got scared on that one?  Yeah, you know, if it doesn't move, at least a couple of points in one sitting, I got to get out.  I don't sit on something very long.  I just bought in on a few things when the NASDAQ took a dip today at about one o'clock or so.  Bought in some stuff.  Now I'm waiting to toss it. 
[06:30]
 Well, I had CVS and I got rid of CVS for that crummy WWF stock and I took a loss big time.  Who's your financial advisor?  CVS for WWF?  Horrible.  Bad mistake.  We've got to get stock broker Dave to talk stocks again.  Did you see what this POM did today?  POM and IPO came out today, those little friggin' POM pilot things that everyone's talking about.  Oh, I heard about that.  Spinoff of 3Com.  Oh my God, 38 bucks, the IPO. 
[07:00]
 The thing went up to like the 160s.  That settled down to, last I checked it was at 106 or something like that.  But yeah, people were buying in.  I was reading the message board.  People buying in at like 145 bucks and they're getting told they sell it at 119 and they're crying.  Crying.  Yeah, IPOs aren't a guarantee.  You've got to be insane to buy into an IPO when the market opens that day.  You're insane.  Because it's going to be run up so high that by the time you get in, it's got nowhere to go but down. 
[07:30]
 Remember Zoom?  Oh, remember my experience with the IPO?  Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  Zoom.com, yes I do.  Oh, I got zoomed up the yim yam on that one.  Maybe the WWF will go up once they get Stephanie McMahon off the air.  There you go, really.  I've had it with her.  It's going to happen soon.  You know, Shane McMahon has come back and it's just a matter of time before Vince pops his head back into the action.  Exactly, it'll go up.  Well, Tom, thank you for coming on tonight.  All right, man. 
[08:00]
 Let's go to John.  John, you're next on WWF.  What's up?  Yo, O&N, what's up?  How are you?  Good, how you guys doing?  Great.  All right.  That guy's crazy.  Don and Micah are pretty good.  Yeah, so far so good, right?  I found myself laughing.  Yeah, they're all making me laugh.  The intro is a little long.  Yeah, I think Aunt and I need some slick Hollywood radio show open.  They're a little more polished than we are, that's for sure.  Don and Micah are like, Opie and Anthony, Ed, 10, 15 years. 
[08:30]
 Yeah, you know?  That might be it.  We like this edgy, rough feel to our radio show.  You ever watch the Archies and then the Little Archies cartoon?  They're like the Little Archies.  They're like the Little Archies.  Or the Flintstones and they had the baby Flintstones.  That's us.  Baby Flintstones.  We don't need a show opener or nothing.  We just kind of like, you know, just a couple of tunes to open it up.  We just get into it.  We don't have a schedule of things we're going to talk about. 
[09:00]
 No.  That would help at times.  It really would, but we don't.  I feel like I'm back in school.  I know.  When you got nothing to do on the show, you just go to us because we have nothing to say either.  Yeah, and we can rag you, John.  Well, that's the dangerous, those are the dangerous things.  Those are the dangerous shows when Aunt and I don't have anything to say and then we're like,  all right, let's rely on our listeners and we go to the phones and you guys are sucking too?  Oh, no.  I mean, you guys are.  They're happy.  Don't be they have nothing to say.  And then we're like, okay, let's go through our O&A archives and try to play some old bits and get us through this mess. 
[09:30]
 I hate to talk about equipment here in the studio, but I can't deal with this.  Look at your monitor for the phone calls.  Yeah.  Is it doing something to your eyes?  No.  It looks the same as it always did?  Oh, yeah.  Colombo did something to my monitor.  He probably cleaned it off.  No.  Yeah, right.  There might have been some splooge on there or something.  There's probably like a dust film on it that kind of toned down all those bright colors you're looking at.  I'll tell you what it is.  The frequency to the monitor is not synchronized with the frequency of the computer. 
[10:00]
 Oh, so it's like going, yeah.  So I'm getting this wacky thing happening.  I think it's your virus setting in, Ann.  It's driving my eyes crazy.  I can't look at it.  All right, John.  All right.  Yo, Opi.  Yeah.  Woo hoo hoo!  Now, here's a blast from the past.  Later, guys.  Okay.  Hey, Opi, is it time for the all-request and dedication hour?  Okay. 
[10:30]
 Hey, who's on Homegrown tonight?  Which band is going to be featured on Homegrown?  Yeah, don't you have an air conditioner button?  Shut up.  Ass.  I wanted to do a construction down the hall.  I wanted to get in there, maybe hang a couple of pieces of duckler for old time.  I took you out of hell, and this is how you pay me back.  Oh, come on.  Okay.  It's the all-request and dedication hour.  Shut up.  Breaker one-niner.  That was Ant's radio show. 
[11:00]
 I was on Motorola.  16 to bass, 16 to bass.  That was my radio show.  Oh, boy.  All right, let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on, man?  Opi!  What's going on, Anthony?  Hey.  What are you guys up to?  Talking to you, man.  Hey, I was thinking about this whole Donna Mike thing.  Yeah.  I used to live down in D.C.  I used to listen to them.  They are actually very, very good.  Yeah. 
[11:30]
 But the thing is, we're so used to just like his sucking that we have this trigger reaction  to turn the radio off after you guys shut him.  Yeah.  So a lot of people, I think that everyone in New York, I mean like New York's a tough  market to hit.  And like I think that we all just need to like give him a chance.  You know something?  This guy is completely right because I was driving, I drove out of the garage and it  took to the West Side Highway to go, oh my God, wait a minute, there's something to listen  to on N.E.W. 
[12:00]
 There's a new show.  I was listening to K-Rock.  Exactly.  And then I punched over and then back to N.E.W.  You're just used to turning off.  I mean you literally had, when like his father's show, I don't know if you guys fully realized  the capacity of this, you really had all of the LNA listeners literally change the station.  Yeah, I know.  I showed up in the numbers.  I mean it was like sort of like a second nature after some point.  So like we just have to give Donald Mike a chance.  I used to listen to him down in D.C.  They're pretty funny.  They do these like crazy Vegas style shows.  It's a cheap thrill. 
[12:30]
 They're a good show.  All we ask is you guys give him a chance.  Definitely.  I mean I don't think you like him, but at least give them a chance.  And a couple of days isn't going to do it.  You've got to listen.  You've got to kind of get to know the characters and who's who.  You can't just decide after five minutes.  Who the retard on the show is.  Who's the intelligent one?  Who does the voices?  It's definitely, definitely a good show.  You guys, we should give it a try.  Who's the raving lunatic?  You know what I found really funny yesterday?  We went back to the office after the show and they started ripping our bosses, who were 
[13:00]
 their bosses too, down in D.C.  Just started ripping our bosses a new A-hole.  I heard that.  And there's still new bosses to us.  So you don't lay right into them.  You know it's a new boss.  You get a relationship.  You know you can't really call somebody an A-hole until they're a good friend of yours.  You know what I mean?  So we're not even at that point yet.  And to listen to them just tearing Jeremy apart.  We were crying in the office.  It was hysterical.  That was great.  I guess they know each other very well. 
[13:30]
 We're going to give a few more days, maybe another week, and then we're going to maybe  simulcast and get all four of us on the air at the same time.  That would be cool actually.  I think that could be fun.  That could be really fun.  All right Pete.  I'd like to really quickly though before I go, all the listeners give them a chance.  Thanks guys.  You know because you would listen to them in Washington.  Yeah they're good.  They're good.  Just give them a chance.  If you don't like them in a month or so, then so be it.  At least you could say you gave it a chance.  Exactly.  All right man.  All right fellas.  Thank you.  All right.  We have a new detective on the line. 
[14:00]
 Chris, you're next on NAW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up guys?  How are you?  All right.  Listen man, I've got water main break.  Yeah.  You guys can hear.  Yeah.  I have a situation down there.  A situation.  I've been watching New York 1.  It's a mess.  Well you mentioned how old the water mains are.  Yeah.  Some of the pipes they're digging up there carved out of wooden logs.  Oh my God.  That's how old it is man.  That's great.  That's amazing.  New York City.  There's wooden logs carrying the water. 
[14:30]
 Hey, could you guys do us a favor and get some of those bumps to take a bath in that  water main break down there?  Oh yeah.  They all come down with buckets you know.  They start filling up when they see the water main breaks.  They put them in their homes and they're done.  Listen man, hey could I put out a few to my brother man?  Yeah.  What's his name?  My brother Rick man.  All right.  I want to put out a few to him for bushing up the family.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you bro.  You guys suck.  And Jackie too man. 
[15:00]
 All right bro.  See you later.  There goes Chris the detective.  Nice.  Some of those pipes carved out of wood.  They're finding out.  Carved out of logs.  Like the Indians that we hear before they sold Manhattan made those log pipes that are  under the ground.  You think that's true?  Come on.  I wouldn't doubt it man.  You know, this city is old.  Water mains come out of logs.  There is some crap under these streets.  You have no clue what's going on down there.  There is a whole other world going on under this city.  I would like to take a tour of some of the stuff that's going on in this city. 
[15:30]
 Oh yeah?  Yeah, I saw on one of those stations where they take you on a tour of all the old subway  stations that are officially closed down to the public.  You can't even go down into the subway station.  Yeah.  And they open up manhole covers and stuff and they bring you down.  And it's still like a subway stop with a ticket booth and everything from the past.  You can check it out.  Ancient history.  Oh, that would be nice though.  Oh, look at that.  Look, it's a dog.  Oh, look.  Oh wait, that's a rat.  The New York City sewer rat. 
[16:00]
 Stay away.  They got some big ones down there.  You don't want to F with them.  I saw a guy, homeless guy, over on Broadway right around 72nd pushing a shopping cart  with clothes in it, homeless guy, and a huge live rat on top of a pile of clothing in his  shopping cart.  I was like, oh my gosh.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  on top of the pile of clothing in his shopping cart.  And he stopped and scratched the little rat under the chin and then got back behind a  shopping cart and started pushing it again. 
[16:30]
 There was this little pet, huh?  I had a sm- There were just these moments that happened in New York because most of  the time you're just walking down the street and you don't notice anything.  You go to the store, you go to work, whatever you're doing.  But then there are those moments when something happens and you notice something.  That I noticed.  You noticed that one.  The other day also, a moment I noticed, I'm driving to work.  I see this woman, white woman, 500 pounds, had to be 500 pounds on the median with a 
[17:00]
 walkman on dancing.  Dancing.  Like shaking hard.  Crap.  That's what makes New York special though.  It was the drive that I usually I'm just, okay, another red light, another cab, another  I'm trying to get to the parking lot.  It took me like, oh my God, what is that?  It snaps you out of that whole lull that you're in, that whole hypnotic state that you go  through when you're in New York when you see something like that.  That's the stuff that makes the city go round and round.  Remember you just brought up something that reminded me of something. 
[17:30]
 Remember when we were working in Boston and the huge lady that fell through the sidewalk?  God damn, that was funny.  She was about 350, 350, 400.  About 350, 350, 400 maybe.  And the sidewalk gave way and swallowed her.  Yeah, she just fell into like a sinkhole, fell into the sidewalk and couldn't get out.  And the front page of the Boston Herald, I believe it was, it was just this huge, huge 
[18:00]
 lady stuck in the middle of the sidewalk.  She fell through.  And the fire department's trying to pull her out with some, the jaws of life or something.  They had one fire guy in the hole with her trying to pull her up as well.  We made a huge poster of this front page headline.  Yeah, it was like six foot by three foot.  And we had it in our office for years.  It made us laugh every freaking day, every day.  Some things happen like that.  They're just moments that get your attention. 
[18:30]
 Right.  Dan from Valley College, New York, Valley Cottage, New York.  What do you think of the Bill Cosby episode?  What was he looking for?  Jell-O?  Well, we'll be talking to the Cos, hopefully a little later today.  Yeah, I think the Cos might need some coffee to compensate for the medication.  You think?  All right, we'll get you some coffee.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We're going to regroup, move on to other topics here.  So give us a call, 212-757-1027. 
[19:00]
 Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  How many times do we have to tell you?  You're a little chubby.  You're packed on the pounds for winter.  You got to get rid of it now.  Stacker two.  Or you're going to be in our ugly ass competition the next time we do a road show.  Do you want to be part of the ugly ass competition or the hot bikini contest competition? 
[19:30]
 Your choice.  You can go either way.  If you want to...  Either way though, we could use you.  Yeah.  for ugly ass, do not listen to this spot.  It is not for you.  Stacker two would not be for you if you want to win the ugly ass contest.  That's right.  But if you want to lose the pounds, then get that nice slender ass.  Stacker two.  It does three things, Anthony.  It burns the fat.  It also builds muscle.  That's the other thing it does.  It crushes the cravings to snack in between meals and it gives you a boost of energy. 
[20:00]
 Wait, wait.  That's four.  That's four now.  I know.  Oh my God.  But it does build muscle as well.  Okay.  At Stacker Two, the world's strongest fat burner, they have a website, stackertwo.com  or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker Two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands, thousands have proven it works.  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  And our phone number, 212-757-1027. 
[20:30]
 The fax line, 212-957-9639.  I'm kind of bummed.  We were supposed to talk over a little Tool at, Anthony.  Oh, didn't start playing?  No, we love Tool.  A misfire.  A misfire of a car.  Because then I was going to seg into the fact that Tool is heading into the studio and they're  going to have a new album out later this year.  Ah, so that would have worked out perfectly.  You see how radio works?  See, we would have came out.  Here's to Tool, right?  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027. 
[21:00]
 Hey, Anthony, this is Tool.  Man.  You love Tool, right?  Oh, yeah, rock.  Let's crawl away.  Hey, Anthony, you know Tool is heading into the studio and there's going to be a new album  out later this year?  Thank you for that bit of spontaneous information, Opie.  I really appreciate it.  While we're talking about bands, hey, Fatboy Slim, live mix CD coming out March 28th, Anthony.  Yeah.  Pearl Jam, new album coming out later this year.  Uh-oh.  A European tour begins in May. 
[21:30]
 You have a problem with a new Pearl Jam CD, Anthony?  I don't know.  You know something?  Every time the new CD comes out from Pearl Jam, I just get a little scared because the  first song they release off it usually blows monkey ass.  It's a marketing strategy.  I guess so.  I'll tell you what it is.  When a band gets really, really popular, they could hand in anything to radio stations  and they're going to play it.  Does that mean the stations are going to start bringing up the Pearl Jam from the catalog,  start playing some of the older stuff before the new thing's out and we could start hearing 
[22:00]
 ...  But if I ever hear that one again, I'll just drive into an embankment.  I've got to admit, I've given up on Pearl Jam.  I used to really, really like them a lot, but I could care less.  He let her shoot himself, become legendary.  Like Kurt.  Bye-bye.  All right, I could turn you on to something today. 
[22:30]
 A lot of great phone calls.  If you're on hold, hold on a second, all right?  What?  The new Black Crowes Jimmy Page song, man.  What?  What?  Oh, you're not a Black Crowes fan.  I'm not a big Black Crowes fan.  I'm a huge Black Crowes fan.  Seeing them all smoking weed, saying, hey, why don't we get Jimmy Page? 
[23:00]
 And my disband this morning was Southern Harmony, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was tracking through some new ... No Doubt.  Hey, people, that's a callback from yesterday's show.  That's right.  Anyway, this song has been available only on the Internet.  You can download it as an MP3.  Is it going to be in store soon, Ben?  Do you know?  You have to purchase it through the Internet.  Yeah, but we've got a copy.  And you want to check it out, Ann, or what? 
[23:30]
 Yeah, what the hell?  It's the Black Crowes and Jimmy Page.  This thing rocks.  All right, I'm listening.  A lot of Black Crowes and Zeppelin fans very excited about this damn thing.  It's called What Is and What Should Never Be.  You know, the old Zeppelin tune.  Reworked with Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes, live from L.A., recorded last year.  The track can be downloaded at WindowsMedia.com, but we have it for you here today.  I'm looking forward to it.  Let me hear it.  You're such a liar.  Let me enjoy this, okay? 
[24:00]
 Okay, no, I'm really looking forward to it.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible.  You better screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, three.  WNW.  Well, we got the Cos in the studio.  The Cos.  And also live from L.A., it's Jay Moore.  Jay.  Hi, guys.  For his weekly visit.  What's up, Jay?  I don't know how Cos could be in the studio when he's here at my house.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Put him on the phone. 
[24:30]
 Well, he's in the other room.  Cos.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Put him on the phone.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Pick up the other one.  Now, I would like to talk to you about my penis.  Now, you take your hand and you place it below my butt.  And you begin to stick it forward.  And it feels good.  And it's great to get in prison for it. 
[25:00]
 In prison for it.  In prison for it.  Before you know it, it flies in shit shot.  Filth of tharn.  Filth of tharn.  Far and flizom.  Oh, flizom.  It seems to Cos in a little bit of trouble there.  Oh, what's up, man? 
[25:30]
 LaShelle Covington, 20.  That's been a rumor about Cos for a long time.  What, that he likes grabbing girls' hands and shoving them  down his pants?  Yeah.  That's great.  Did you read the story in LA, Jay?  No.  I'm still in comic time.  I've been sleeping for once.  Oh, this is a great story.  LaShelle Covington, she's been on the Cosby show a few times.  LaShelle.  LaShelle.  LaShelle.  I don't know how to pronounce these names.  LaShelle.  Ricky Lake with that name.  LaShelle.  LaShelle.  Ricky Lake name.  LaShelle, when did you and Rat Tattooing know Latrine was the Breeze baby? 
[26:00]
 Well, when I talked to Listerine.  Hold on, Kaluwa.  It's Portia's turn.  LaMondula.  LaMondula.  Amphorine, please.  Amphorine.  Amphorine.  What was the thing?  Well, she's an actress.  She's been on the Cosby show, but she hasn't had speaking parts on the Cosby show.  I wonder why.  Well, she went to Cos' little house there.  His little posthouse.  To his townhouse to get some food.  To his townhouse to get some acting advice. 
[26:30]
 Acting advice on the Cos.  That seems a little strange right there.  That's the best.  She goes to his house for a little acting advice.  She's a whoa.  A whoa.  Well, she filed a police report saying the beloved comedian put her hand under his t-shirt  and guided it south toward his sweatpants.  That's a crime?  Well, it's a crime.  What law did he break?  You see, the penis is below the nose.  It's below the belt line, so I wanted her to touch the penis. 
[27:00]
 I put your hand on my belly, but I was hoping it would not stay where I put it.  What was he doing?  I was guiding her hand toward what I like to call Fat Albert.  Well, sometimes when I drink too much, it's dumb dumb.  Fat Albert and then the Cosby kids hanging right below him.  I like to call my left nut Rudy and my right nut Bill. 
[27:30]
 Rudy hangs a little lower because he's the head of a thing below Fat Albert.  If you stroke Rudy just right, the next thing you know,  Fat Albert starts tripping and drizzling all over the little issues.  So am I.  I'm flexible.  Hey, Jay, I think Cosby wanted to play What's in My Pants, huh?  I say Paul Rack was an afro, 
[28:00]
 proudly shaved and she dates a fireman because it has a brass knob.  What law did he break?  Well, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office,  they decide no crime had been committed.  She pulled her hand away, and at that point,  it was a consensual little circumstance.  So the cops never questioned Cosby.  However, the story gets better there, Jay Moore.  Well, now she's going to sue him.  In the upcoming issue of the National Enquirer, 
[28:30]
 Covington's relatives are quoted saying Cosby went further  grabbing her breasts, trying to put his hand down her pants  and exposing himself to the young actor.  If that's the case, there's crimes going on on a daily basis  right here in this studio.  I was just going to say that to better take.  It's alarming.  Anthony and I think of the same show like a 60% clip.  And it's like 50-50 who gets it out first.  It's alarming.  You want to hear more of the police report?  Cos it is pretty funny. 
[29:00]
 But I don't understand.  Putting a woman's hand on your belly.  Putting a woman's hand down your pants.  You know how many times, you know my trick was  when you didn't think you were getting anywhere?  Yeah.  This works, guys.  Any guy listening, this is a great one.  There we go.  More advice.  Batten down the hatches.  More advice.  MOHR advice.  Okay.  Hey, come on, it's the guy that came up with the,  I made two cousins kiss, don't forget.  Absolutely.  We'll never forget it.  All right, when you're in the car making out  and you're like touching breasts and you're not sure  what's going to happen and you just, you know, 
[29:30]
 you could sit there till five in the morning making out.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Yeah.  I mean, time, expedition is the key.  You want to be expeditious in the process of getting laid.  Right.  Because you're making out and when you feel,  don't just do it like right off the bat.  You got to get it like hot and heavy.  You touch the breast, weaken the nipples a little.  Then you take out, it's got to be erect, gentlemen.  Don't take out the acorn.  Take out the rod.  Yeah.  And you just let them see it.  You say, what are we going to do about this?  When they see it, sometimes when they see it, 
[30:00]
 it's like, ah, they can't help it.  Yeah.  They're at least going to touch it out of curiosity  because they can't believe you.  The worst thing that's going to happen is they're going to kick you out of the car.  What are we going to do about this?  It's a problem, though.  What are we going to do about this?  You know what that's how you do it.  You're like, oh my god, look how excited you get me.  You show them.  It's like it's a compliment.  That's a brave move, Jake.  That is a bold move, man.  I'm telling you it works because when they see it, 
[30:30]
 well, not Rick because he's an egg roll,  but when they see most nice, handsome, circumcised penises,  they like penises.  But if Rick takes out an egg roll, they're going to be like,  I don't know about that one there.  Why don't you peel it yourself and get back to me?  I love the girls in the car.  You're making out with them and stuff and you want to go for a patch  and they have all those karate moves preventing you from getting down there.  Yeah.  I didn't realize their arms could move like that.  Yeah, they do this special.  I've been on the road. 
[31:00]
 What are we going to do about this?  Any question I like to pose at about 1.15 a.m.?  What are we going to do about my ractitis?  It looks like a jello putting pop on it.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, she treated like what?  Phil Farn and Phil.  You're not funny.  Rudy never minding putting her hand down in Macaza's pants during the car. 
[31:30]
 Little Rudy.  What a great story in the paper.  Why did a 60-year-old girl have a mustache?  Did Rudy have a little dirty Sanchez going?  I can't believe a 65-year-old man trying to get pussy is news.  It's a 20-year-old chick and he's like putting his hand down.  What else can you do when you're worth a billion dollars and you're 65 years old?  You think you could be a little smoother than that though. 
[32:00]
 He's in his swank townhouse in his big, stinky Cosby sweatpants.  Repeat that.  With his big belly.  Repeat the first part of your sentence.  He's in his posh townhouse.  Yeah, she came to him.  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean you could...  We're backing advice.  You know what though?  If he probably would have had just a tad more class, it would have worked.  Like a kisser on the mouth?  I don't know.  I don't know what the movie is but I don't think it's grab her hand and put it in your 
[32:30]
 pants.  Yeah, Jay, what's the move?  I told you it's a make-out but it's fully erect.  Take it out.  What are you going to do about it?  Stroke it at yourself and say, look how excited you make me.  What are we going to do about it?  Crazy.  Look at this.  Oh my God, I'm in pain.  I'm in pain.  What are we going to do about this?  It just sounds like a problem.  It's so funny.  What are we going to...  Oh, look at this.  Geez, I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  It's so funny.  What are we going to...  Oh, look at this.  Geez, I've got to take this back to the shop.  What are we going to do about this?  No, then you start doing it yourself and they're like, then they feel stupid that they're just 
[33:00]
 sitting there watching you masturbate.  And you know it's powerful hockey.  Take it from the man.  Brilliant.  Brilliant move.  I'm telling you, somebody's got to try that move.  Bravo.  It's funny, Opie's going to try it on his girlfriend where he doesn't even have to try  it.  What are we going to do about it?  Opie will be like, make it out tonight and just take it out and be like, oh, what are  we going to do about this?  Put that away.  Put it in me.  What are you talking about?  I'm going to try the what are we going to do about this line.  I encourage all our listeners to try the what are we going to do about this line. 
[33:30]
 Let us know how it works.  It's got to be like, oh my God, you're in so much pain because it's all out of your  pants.  Hold on.  This girl Kelly says this trick works.  I'm going to put you on Kelly, J.  Kelly.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Lovely.  Great.  It does work.  Really?  Because when you see a good looking penis, you want to take care of it.  It is so true and I can tell you from experience, it's very true.  It has happened many a times.  From the way you're talking, it sounds like you're doing one right now. 
[34:00]
 No, actually right now I'm on my way to work.  I'm like deep **** with my voice.  Watch that curse word.  Sorry, but I'm really...  No cursing.  You can't curse.  Kelly, Kelly, what are we going to do about this?  I don't know.  I have to come visit.  I guess she has to be in the same room, right, J?  It works better when you're there with the person.  Yeah.  Why does it work?  Because you see it and you're already excited and there's the sight of it.  Make sure you do something about it.  If you're making out for like five hours and you haven't done that yet, you're in serious 
[34:30]
 problems, okay?  But I'm thinking after an hour of making out, you should be doing it by then, okay?  Or less than an hour.  When you see it fully erect, you almost feel guilty for the guy.  If the guy starts stroking it himself, you're going to be like, all right, get out of the  way, let me do it.  You don't stop right away.  I've got norton torques in me for a little while.  Joke it up!  I'm going in!  It works though.  All right, Kelly, thank you.  You're welcome. 
[35:00]
 Well, look at that.  How drunk was that girl?  This girl Joanne says that your trick works.  One more lady that says the J-more trick works.  You guys didn't believe me when I unveiled the trick.  No, I didn't.  That's a ballsy move.  Joanne!  Hello!  Hi.  All right, J, that trick has worked so many times on me it's not even funny.  Wow.  Tell everybody.  So many times.  Your uncles are going to start pulling it out.  So, what, you're making out with a guy, you're getting hot and heavy, he pulls out his junk  and says, what are we going to do about it?  And it works for you, huh?  And let me tell you, it's like, okay, I'll be a good girl tomorrow. 
[35:30]
 Wow.  You know, you go along, you're going to say, you're saying I'm going to behave myself.  No, this is not going any further.  Yeah.  I'm going to remain calm.  We're just going to end the night nicely tonight.  I'm going to be a...  He takes it out and the next thing you know, it's just irresistible.  That's right.  It's a beautiful sight.  It truly is.  Some filth and flarn.  I told you when they see it, you guys don't realize that it's actually an attractive  thing to women. 
[36:00]
 It is a weapon.  Yeah.  Well, that was a storyline episode 54 when I taught Theo that trick.  He went out and pulled out his stuff.  Filth and flarn.  Put your hand down for the big sweaty sweat bands of the cause Filth and Flarn.  I applaud the cause.  I think if you're a billionaire and you worked as hard as he has, as long as he has, and  a girl comes to your house and you put her hand on your belly, your big old belly. 
[36:30]
 Oh my God.  And you're doing a big, charismatic business, I think he's done nothing wrong and I think  this country's gone bananas.  Where do you draw the line between sexual harassment and trying to get laid?  Yeah, but you know something?  She came over to your house.  She went for acting advice.  She honestly knew what the deal was.  I'm just saying a little more cooth.  Maybe she didn't right away want to plunge down at his 60 year old.  Cooth?  Don't need cooth.  Poor guys need cooth.  Melted Turkish Caffeine Nuts.  If you're a decent looking guy that has a billion dollars, you don't need cooth. 
[37:00]
 You pull down your pants and go, hey, play with this.  I'm worth a billion.  I own the little rascals.  I own the little rascals.  I want you to grab my buckwheat.  You need to grab it.  Look, my little stymies right here.  You're it.
