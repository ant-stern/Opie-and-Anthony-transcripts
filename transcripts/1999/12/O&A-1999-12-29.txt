 Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 1-0-2-7.  And you're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  I don't know. I don't know.  I think I distorted last night.  What do you mean?  Oh, well, I'm leaving the city and I'm driving.  And the roads are kind of wet, you know.  Except it was raining, Opie, it was raining.  Well, that happens from time to time, sure.  Yeah.  You know how slippery it can get with the paint on the street, you know, 
[00:30]
 like crosswalks and like the lines where you're supposed to stop and stuff.  All right, all right. Let me stop you.  What did you do?  Well, it wasn't hard or anything.  Did someone beat up your car like they did in the end?  No, no, no.  At that time?  Just I need to paint one cab on my door.  I need to like a fighter pilot. I got one.  You took out a cab?  I got one.  Right on. 
[01:00]
 I didn't take him out. I just busted his tail light.  So what did he do?  I stepped on the brake. The thing kind of went...  You know, my anti-lock brakes and stuff.  But I slept. I'm supposed to have anti-lock brakes.  And just tapped him. Like no damage or anything to it,  especially to my vehicle, the cow catcher on the front.  Didn't even scratch the rubber.  But his tail light, you know, brakes.  He gets out, my cab, this is a 1998.  Do you know what the tail light go for? 
[01:30]
 I'm like, no, I guess you're going to tell me, right?  It's $500.  $500.  $500.  Come on.  Over a tail light. Get out of here, Habib.  What are you talking about?  $500.  And he's talking like that's it. I go, it's a lens on the front of that.  No, not lens. He opens his trunk up.  Whole unit must be replaced.  And I swear it wasn't even the entire lens.  It was like the lower part of it. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, like the orange part.  Yeah, regardless, even if he had to replace the entire lens.  $500 for this lens.  The whole thing, trunk and back seat must be replaced.  You make me lose fair.  $500 you pig.  So he's just ragging and stuff.  I'm like, well, you know something, then? Call the cop.  Call the cop.  Oh, I will call the cop.  Look, come with me to Auto Parts store. 
[02:30]
 We'll show you that.  Now he wants me to follow him to the Auto Parts store.  Oh, yeah, that's good.  I go, all right, look, I rear-ended the guy.  He's making a big to-do about it.  I said, okay, pal, look, there's a cash machine right there.  I'll take $100 out.  $100.  Thank you for your F and 10.  It wasn't 98. It was a brand new.  $100.  Brand new.  I screwed up, man. I slid into him.  What am I going to do?  He accepted $100?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:00]
 Now he's just going to go to the hardware store, get the red tape, and he's going to be safe.  Of course he is.  I just gave a guy $100 for nothing.  I could have done that, or I could have waited for a cop report, go through insurance.  It'll end up being more than $100 in the long run when the insurance company gets a hold of you.  You know what I mean?  $100?  I know. I didn't feel good about it myself.  And then he's yelling, like before I even made him that offer, that $500, $500. 
[03:30]
 And he goes, I will talk to another cabbie. He will tell you.  Of course he will.  So you know what happens? He screwed him.  Another cab pulls over.  The guy gets out. He goes, how much you owe me for this taillight?  And the guy in the other cab is like, oh, that happened to me the other day.  It's like $90 or something like that.  But you have a $90, $70, and $90, $90, and $90.  He's screaming.  $100.  I was just like, ah, god.  This should be able to punch him in the face for $100.  I felt a little extorted. I felt like I was taken advantage of, like I screwed up because I actually paid him. 
[04:00]
 But it's like, what are you going to do? Stand there and wait?  I had to make a decision. I didn't want to let it go through the insurance company.  So I told him $100.  I'm surprised you were polite enough to stop.  Usually you just keep going, Anthony.  There was really no good place to go.  Oh, I had him in God. What are you kidding? You're the hit and run guy.  I never hit and run. I never hit. 
[04:30]
 I don't hit people.  That was the first even encounter in New York City since we've been here.  And you see the way I drive.  Well, we had another one when I was driving.  That was you.  The famous guy knocking out my side view.  That cost me $250 for a side view mirror.  Well, at least when I tap people, it's their car, Opie, not them in the crosswalk.  Well, the light was green. I wanted to go.  It wasn't like I dassed it. I just kind of in-stopped, hit the guy, hit him in the hip.  Figured he would move out of the way and we'd be set. We'd be through the light. 
[05:00]
 He moved out of the way, all right? Moved over to your side view mirror and punched it off your car.  One of the most amazing punches I've ever seen.  How much did that cost you to get it fixed?  I told you, $250.  See, that cost you $250.  Well, because you got the automatic mirrors and all that crap.  I got it all cheap, $100.  $100 for a taillight.  We've got to keep it tall. That's $350 we've got to shell out because of our driving habits.  It could have been a lot worse, the stuff we've pulled in the past year and a half.  Julio? 
[05:30]
 What happened, dude?  I'll tell you why you wanted the $500 for that taillight.  That's the cost and it's deductible.  Oh, yeah. Well, that makes sense.  I'll tell you one thing. So many people are just so pissed at insurance companies,  you don't want to go through them.  They're the ones that are getting money out of everybody and you don't even want to go through them  because you're paying enough for your premiums already.  If even you have a little fender bender, your premiums go up.  It's worth it just to pay the people off.  Absolutely. 
[06:00]
 $500 for a taillight.  Stacy, what's going on?  First of all, I'm not going to poke fun at you guys,  but Habib is an Arabic name and you're doing an Indian accent.  Do you think we know? Do you think we care?  We've got a Chinese guy named Yoshi.  It's not called the Opie, Anthony and Stacy show, so we'll do whatever the hell we want.  Stacy, what nationality are you?  I'm a Jew.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No surprise, the Jew's nitpicking.  Listen, we've got to do something. 
[06:30]
 We're going to have to spin the ethnic wheel today.  I'm feeling in that mood today.  So am I.  You know what? My husband is Arabic, so if you've got something to say,  we've got to do it right now.  Habib? Habib married a Jew?  He's not Habib. Yeah, Jew and an Arab are married.  That's pretty interesting.  How do you know that Kaby was an Indian?  Your particular Kaby?  Yeah. How do you know I wasn't just doing an Indian guy?  Hello, give me $500.  You are, but you said Habib.  Yeah, and what's Habib?  Habib is an Arabic.  Maybe he was an Arab guy born in India, you bitch.  Oh my God.  And not every person named Habib is an Arabic. 
[07:00]
 And every Jew is a Jew.  If you just call me a bitch, I'm going to call my lawyer.  Really?  I like when people fight back.  Good job, Stacy.  Stacy, don't sue me.  I'll give you $100.  That's how much the camp drive is trying to sort from my husband and I.  We were called out one day and a camp driveer actually was going to help us.  And the cab driver tried to jump start our Jeep. 
[07:30]
 It was a success.  However, try to blame this jump start on the fact that their portable CD player stopped working.  As a result of the jump start they tried to get us.  So she said, give us $100.  And so we called it a kiss-off.  You know what?  You're a Jew ass.  Exactly.  You got it.  Yeah, something about the Kabbys.  I don't see them as being the most ethical people when it comes to if you get into a little fender-bender,  them not trying to get the better of the deal.  You know what I mean?  I think they're very ethical. 
[08:00]
 When you tell them where to go, they take the direct route, right, Anthony?  Of course.  You want to go to the village?  They know exactly how to go, the shortest distance between two points, right?  Well, when you're hopping, it's the...  They're not zig-zagging all across town, are they?  I know when someone's coming from LaGuardia or something.  You're brand new, I just come to America.  Want to take me to a park in Meridia?  Oh, okay.  That we have to go through Jersey. 
[08:30]
 Wherever you have to go.  How much money is this?  Oh, that's the lowest denomination, the one with the grant on it.  Too funny.  All right, we're just getting started.  I'm seriously thinking about spinning the ethnic wheel today.  Ethnic wheel?  It's kind of a brand new feature on the ONA show.  Basically, we got a bunch of ethnic groups on this wheel,  kind of like the Wheel of Fortune wheel.  We spin it, and whatever ethnic group it stops on, 
[09:00]
 we spend an hour telling jokes about that ethnic group.  What do you do?  One of my favorite bits from the Greaseman show.  What do you think?  I like it.  You like it?  Boy, I hope it lands on the black, sir.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  We're going to have to clean this in to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible. 
[09:30]
 You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  And we got to welcome Rick, our producer, back to the show.  He's back.  Rick, now a married man.  Yep.  Hold it up high.  Let me just say.  Oh, hold it up.  There it is.  Wow.  Boy, that is a prominent drink, isn't it?  Jesus, there ain't no mistake in that. 
[10:00]
 I've been tagged on a return to the wild.  She knows exactly what I'm saying.  That looks like a tagging.  This one's been tagged.  Look at him.  I saw that guy this weekend.  Did you have the crocodile hunt there?  God damn, this thing makes me laugh.  Isn't he funny?  He's really funny.  He like doesn't care what the hell he's doing.  I've seen him stick his head in a cave where there were snakes.  And the snake started biting his face.  And he's just like, look at these gorgeous creatures.  They're gorgeous.  They're biting my face.  This is gorgeous. 
[10:30]
 And he's got his wife with him.  She's some American broad.  And they're in the middle of a river.  There's crocodiles in there.  And you see one go by, a big one.  He's like, watch the boat, honey.  And he jumps in.  And he starts grabbing the mouth.  And he's talking as he's doing it.  I'm going to try to roll him over before he goes into a death roll.  Death roll?  Because they did like a rock will grab onto us something. 
[11:00]
 And then roll.  It'll just spin.  So whatever up its tail and everything is, it can't get frayed.  And also whatever it's grabbed onto, it's ripping a chunk out of it as the croc spins.  Sure.  You know, usually it's some poor, dopey wildebeest that went into the river.  Not this dopey Australian guy who's trying to wrestle it on his home turf.  He's got to alligator his home turf.  I've got him now.  Honey, OK, honey, now jump in.  And he gets his wife in there to sit on the croc's head.  Sit on his head, honey. 
[11:30]
 I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum.  I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum and see if he's male or female.  Well, this weekend he was chasing crocodiles.  He was chasing them?  Yeah, there was some form of crocodile.  They moved pretty damn fast and stuff.  And he was chasing them.  They were about three, four feet long.  They run like a mother.  And he's running all over the places, tackling these things.  He doesn't care.  No.  I've seen him with all kinds of animals.  And he gets bitten.  He had a kangaroo once.  And he was trying to wrestle that thing down. 
[12:00]
 And the thing's just kicking the crap out of him.  He's gorgeous.  Look at the color on this.  It's just bleeding and everything.  Yeah.  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, you ever notice that he's always wearing those same khaki shorts and T-shirt?  That's all he owns.  That's that Australian outback kind of wear he's wearing.  Right, right.  The guy jumps in the ocean, right?  He's going to rescue a shark from a net.  He's wearing his same khaki shorts and T-shirt.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't change.  No, he doesn't change.  His wife throws in the scuba tank with him. 
[12:30]
 And he's still wearing this.  You see him scuba diving underwater in the shirt.  In his crocodile Dundee outfit.  Right, right.  He's got the boots on over his flipper.  He's some kind of superhero, I think.  I don't know what the hell he is.  And then he's diving with those sharks.  And he sticks his hand in the hole in the coral and pulls it out.  And it's like totally bloody.  You see him on the boat.  Look, he got my hand.  They seem to have bitten me.  Yeah, no crap.  Look at what you're doing.  You're taunting them.  The guy has no fear.  What's going on?  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a 
[13:00]
 He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  He's got a little bit of a  Oh, no, don't do this at home.  Yeah, sure.  I was really just thinking of  going out and doing that at home.  Trying to find a snake.  Thank you, Bob.  He was chasing some kind of 
[13:30]
 animals with a land rover,  and he's on the bumper trying to  rope it, and he missed,  so he just tells his wife to  pull up next to it and jumped  off the rover onto this thing's  head.  It looked like he was being  trampled, because he was.  God got him, honey!  I've got him!  Like hoof marks in his face.  Look, it's God!  You think he throws his wife  around like that in the bed  all of a sudden?  Look, I'm going to roll her!  She's going into a death row!  Now I'll stick my thumb up her  bum!  I'm going to give her what we 
[14:00]
 call the lichess!  Take a u-log over her head!  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  I saw him making excuses,  and I thought,  I'm going to give him a  little bit of a  little bit of a  little bit of a  little bit of a  little bit of a  little bit of a  little bit of a little bit of a  little bit of a little bit of a  little bit of a little bit of a  doe,  I saw him making excuses for a  poisonous snake once for trying  to bite him!  I'd be right angry  too,ep If I,  was in your  and, if your  in my house  trying to get my babies.  And it's like coming like  TwoInches from me atures in front of me, 
[14:30]
 snapping away at him  with his wife  for trying to catch these  poisonous snakes  and, like, stop America,  and he's making excuses for  them for  trying to bite him.  That guys' such a  tool he you got to watch!  I was laughing so hard.  Aha!  between that ...  In that one- seuatoind this weekend.  It's Beyond, Moronic.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  It's sup, Moronic.  Okay.  1027.  Yeah, a lot of people want to know if Corky Steinbrenner will be making a appearance today 
[15:00]
 to congratulate Kony on his perfect game, huh?  Oh, there you are.  What's up?  It's Corky Steinbrenner, everyone.  Not the strong boss from the 1970s.  All of a sudden I'm a little wrinkled old man that's so sensitive I cry every two seconds.  Oh, Corky Steinbrenner. 
[15:30]
 Yes.  I see you have your crazy Eddie outfit on.  Same outfit you've been wearing since 1977.  That's how I dress.  I wear my turtleneck.  My little sports jacket.  You were wearing that same outfit yesterday, even though it was 100 degrees.  You must have been sweating your ballies off.  I was wearing this with my fire billy munch.  Billy, where are you?  Billy, I miss you Billy so much. 
[16:00]
 Thurman.  Thurman!  JFK Jr.  The only new ye.  Well, was it nice to have Yogi Bird?  Yogi, Yogi.  Yogi Dareday.  Who could ask for more from a day of baseball? 
[16:30]
 You never thought you'd see the day there, Yogi?  Get into the pocket, get into the...  Wait, what was that?  Yogi in the pocket again.  Oh, it was so good.  He looks like Yoda though.  Yoda, Yogi, what's the difference?  So you must be proud of Conan.  Conan!  Pitching the perfect game yesterday.  Perfect game!  He's the best pitcher in baseball. 
[17:00]
 He sure is.  And you had Don Larson there.  Oh, shit, what a man.  Let's not forget his perfect game from 1956.  1956!  Did you see the picture of me in the paper with...  Daryl!  He's the best crackhead in baseball. 
[17:30]
 We're going to give him another crackhead.  Yeah, in August, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  If we could keep him away from the horse.  He loves those horses.  One crack or another, he's trying to get his nose in it.  Let's not forget about Mattingly.  Mattingly!  Back in the stadium yesterday. 
[18:00]
 Mattingly!  He's such a good player.  Brian Yankees, what the fuck?  He's like, what is that matterless stadium?  I used to be so strong in the 70s.  I never shed a tear.  Remember me yelling at Reggie all the time?  Reggie, Reggie, Reggie, I missed you so. 
[18:30]
 Look at me now, I'm a bumbling fool.  I used to be able to fire people up, didn't I?  I didn't care, I didn't care.  Do you remember what you said in the locker room after you guys won the World Series last year?  I don't know, I was crying.  I said, the Yankees are the best team in baseball.  Where's Dave Linfield?  I love him. 
[19:00]
 Sure you do.  Alright, Corky.  The Bronx Bombers are the best team in the pitch.  I'm the boss, I can't believe how lucky I am.  Do you have any thoughts on a huge Yankee fan that passed this weekend, JFK Jr.?  JFK Jr.?  Why did he have to fly? 
[19:30]
 He worked just like Thurman, didn't he?  And Randy Rhodes.  He ran my favorite guitar plays.  Why?  Leave the fly into professionals.  You don't see me flying, do you?  Stupid for God's sake, he ran me in the helicopter.  Jim Crow Jr. 
[20:00]
 Let's get that.  Don't forget Buddy Holly.  Buddy Holly!  Hey, Julianny, I need a new stadium, please.  Can I have a new stadium, please, man?  I need a Kleenex.  Alright, Corky.  Well, Corky, thanks for stopping by the show.  I used to be so strong that I looked like a woman.  Thanks for letting me on your show, guys. 
[20:30]
 You are my father's pooping assholes in radio.  Corky Steinbrenner, everyone.  Yes.  This is the Boxer-y Mania.  I'll do this one for all the animal lovers since they like gerbils so much. 
[21:00]
 It's a sing-a-long, too, so everybody feel free to join in.  I'm gonna bounce some balls.  Look at those balls. 
[21:30]
 Everybody! 
[22:00]

[24:30]
 Steven Leinstein, everyone.  Opie & Anthony, Opie & Anthony, 1027  Now, more of the worst of Opie & Anthony on SM Talk at 1027.  Oh, yeah. Alright, I'm upstairs now with the King.  Alright, with the King? Yep.  Alright, he's in our lobby. We're gonna try to figure out if he's worthy enough to come down and hang with us today. 
[25:00]
 Alright. Alright.  Here he is. Hello?  Hey, King. Hello.  Hello there. Hello.  How's it going? King? King? Yeah?  Is this the King? Yeah.  Okay. You sound like the King.  I hear that voice. Now we got your CD Gravelands.  Do you like it?  Yeah, it's great. It's quite different. I guess the concept is you're the King singing other people's songs that are dead. 
[25:30]
 Yeah.  And we played Come As You Are in Sweet Home Alabama on our show.  Thank you.  Getting ready for the fire listeners.  They like it, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, it's great.  So why are you here?  So why imitate the King?  Well, he's someone I have loved and admired since I was seven years old.  Do you know why we have you on the phone?  No, why?  We're trying to decide if you're worthy or not to come down here and hang with us. 
[26:00]
 And so far you're not winning the battle.  Alright.  Serious. So what else did you give us?  We're doing several acoustic songs.  Yeah?  So you're going to answer any questions that you have answered?  Well, there's not many questions we want to ask.  Yeah, the Elvis impersonator. Are you an Elvis impersonator? Do you dress up like Elvis and stuff?  Well, I wear a black leather costume similar to the one Elvis wore in the 60s TV special. 
[26:30]
 You sound very excited.  Well, I've been up from 4.30 this morning. I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  We had so many plans delayed on us in Chicago.  And it's been a real long day.  We're setting up a special studio for you, King.  Right. So I'm worthy then.  Well, I don't know if you're worthy yet. I think you need some stacker too.  Well, here's our plan. 
[27:00]
 Here's our plan.  We want you to do a cover of the album.  Here's our plan.  We want you to do at least one song from your Graveland CD.  But we want you to perform it in the bathroom here at N.E.W.  Can you do that?  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom, on the potty.  We're setting up a microphone and everything.  Yeah, we'll have a mic in there for you.  On the potty?  No.  Headphones and stuff.  Well, you don't have to take your pants down or anything. You just got to sit on the toilet. 
[27:30]
 No.  And play your song.  No, I don't want to do that.  Why not?  Because I think it's sick.  Why is that sick?  Because...  I heard there's good acoustics in the bathroom.  Because Elvis Presley died in the bathroom.  Well, yeah, that's the reason we want to do it.  Yeah, that'll give it more of a...  The ultimate tribute to the King himself.  What do you say?  We'll negotiate this point. We'll...  They want me to sing from the bathroom.  We'll plug your CD. We'll allow you to play a couple songs. 
[28:00]
 Elvis died in the bathroom.  It's like the King on his throne.  And just then, they wanted to talk to me on the phone first to see  whether I was maybe worthy enough to sign into the studio.  Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think?  I'm worthy enough to go to the studio, no problem, but I don't want to sing from the bathroom.  Why not? That'll be neat.  We have a mic in there and everything.  I'm not going to sit on the toilet and sing.  On the toilet and sing?  No. 
[28:30]
 See, now, it doesn't sound like you have much of a sense of humor about you.  Are you a funny guy, a fun guy?  Or are you very serious?  Uh...  You're pretty serious, dude.  I would say, yeah. Yeah, I mean, having five children...  Dude, it's a...  And the mortgage is pretty serious.  It's a goof CD, so we're going to goof around with you. What can I tell you?  It's a goof CD?  A goof? Goof? Not good. It's kind of goofy.  Goofy?  What do you think? 
[29:00]
 Like, it's kind of... Don't you think it's a little weird?  Like, I would think you would have this tremendous sense of humor.  It's a fun, warm-hearted CD.  It was okay. I mean, I thought the music was good.  I thought the impersonation needed a little work, but...  Well, that's your opinion. Your intent is good.  So what do you say, King?  We got the studio set up?  No.  It's a great room acoustically?  No. I don't want to sing from the bathroom. 
[29:30]
 Sitting on a toilet.  Is that just because you would never sing from a bathroom?  It's out of respect for Elvis Presley.  Out of respect for Elvis? I think Elvis would be into something like this.  No.  Come on, we wanted you to, you know, be naked in there.  We'll take that away, so you just have to sit on the toilet.  No. I don't want to sit on the toilet.  Why not?  I just explained why.  What if the lid was down?  Yeah, the lid will be down.  I don't care if the lid is down or up.  You don't have to, like...  The cubicle doors open or close. 
[30:00]
 You don't have to take a dump when you hit the high notes or something, you know?  We're just looking for you to sit on the ball.  We'll have a mic in there, headphones.  So that's how Elvis Presley died, is it?  I guess. That's what they say. That's what they say.  But I don't think it was during his performance of a song.  Come on, you're an Elvis impersonator.  You do other people's dead songs.  So you should have a sense of humor and do this.  And then we'll plug the CD and everything.  Yeah, but it's not the...  ...the derogatory humor. It's a... 
[30:30]
 Hey, King, you're making money off other dead artists' work.  Right.  I'm making money. I have a million money.  You know, you sing...  I have a million money. How do you know what money I have made?  You sing a Nirvana song, a Leonard Skinner song, an ACU song...  Jimmy Hendrix...  Excuse me, you are making money off other dead people's work by playing the records on the radio station.  Yeah, and we'll spin records from the bathroom.  Yeah.  James Cameron made the film Titanic.  So you want to start accusing him of making money off people dead. 
[31:00]
 Oh, we hit a soft spot, I believe.  We're not accusing you of anything. All we're saying is...  We're just saying if you're going to sing other people's songs that are dead...  ...that you should have a sense of humor to perform them on the toilet.  As Elvis.  No.  As Elvis. Elvis died on the toilet. Get it?  No.  Are you like in love with Elvis?  I've explained that I don't want to...  No, are you like...  ...sing out of respect for the memory of Elvis.  Are you in love with Elvis? Is that it? Like you have this love for him?  Yeah, fraternal love. Anything wrong with that? 
[31:30]
 A fraternal love?  Anything wrong with the fraternal love?  Or have you found a way to make money off his name?  What?  Just to ask you. Elvis seemed to have had a sense of humor.  Yeah, he had a wonderful sense of humor. We had a sense of humor.  Yeah, and that's kind of a weird sense of humor thing to perform one of the songs sitting on the toilet.  No.  No? So what do you say, King?  I've already told you about it 20 times.  I thought we could talk you into it.  What?  I thought we could talk you into it.  No. 
[32:00]
 See, I guess you didn't really know much about our show then, huh?  No.  We have every artist that ever comes into Opie and Anthony's studio...  ...performs from the bathroom.  That's right.  No.  It's just a coincidence that Elvis died on the toilet. We didn't even take that into consideration, but...  No.  ...it is kind of the way it's set up.  Well, all right, so your final answer is no?  Mm-hmm.  Okay. I guess we could play your CD from here then.  Well, it's up to you. 
[32:30]
 All right, would you like to hear me play?  I would like to go into the studio where you are and perform the songs.  Oh, no, no, the deal is...  We can't do that.  You want me to perform from the bathroom or that's it?  No.  All right, well then I'll play your CD here in the studio.  Why can't you let me go into the studio and perform the songs, man?  Because it's much more fun if you do it in the bathroom, yeah.  No.  No? You sound intense, man.  What?  You sound like you're going to cry or something. You all right? 
[33:00]
 Yeah, I'm all right.  You sound intense. All right, do you ever lighten up or loosen up or laugh or something?  Sometimes.  Yeah, not now. Don't have a sense of humor, huh?  It doesn't sound like...  All right, well, would you like to listen as I play your CD here in the studio?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, here we go. 
[33:30]
 Did you hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, King.  There's pieces of CD all over the studio.  Well, do you think you're the one that has to clean it up?  Yeah, that's all right, though. It was worth it. 
[34:00]
 All right, man, have a great weekend.  I will.  All right.  Oh, my God. I don't think that step was necessary, Opie.  What?  I understand he wasn't going to sing from the bathroom, but...  Now Rick's got to go deal with this. 
[34:30]
 Why is everyone leaving me?  I don't know. I think you were a little harsh.  No, he was being rude to us, too, man.  All right, we got to take a break.  I thought he was going to sing from the bathroom.  I swear to God, I thought we were going to get him to sing from the bathroom.  Well, that would have been fun, right?  Yeah.  What was the big deal?  He seemed to not want to undo it because of Elvis. Elvis died on the toilet.  All right.  So out of his love for Elvis.  What happened? I thought we were just having fun. 
[35:00]
 Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we'll piss someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  We're out of control. We're so ugly.  All right, knock it off.  1027.  Now, more of the worst.  Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.  Good afternoon, library. 
[35:30]
 Hi, I was wondering if you could help me.  I will try.  Okay, my son came home with a list of books that he needs to read for his fourth grade class.  Okay. Why don't I switch you to the children's and she can see if she can help you with one you might need.  Thanks a lot.  Sure, hold on, please.  Children's Department, Karen speaking.  Hi, Karen. I need to come into the library and pick up a few books for my son.  Okay.  He came home with a reading list from his fourth grade class. 
[36:00]
 Do you have Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach?  Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach. Doesn't sound familiar. Doesn't mean we don't have it.  Is there any way you can look that up?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you have others that you're looking for?  Yeah, I guess there's a whole Harry Beaver collection.  Okay, now he doesn't sound familiar, but that's not 100% certain.  I guess he's a new author out of Seattle.  Okay.  He writes children's books.  Okay.  It's Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach, Harry Beaver on the Dyke. 
[36:30]
 The Dyke, okay.  Harry Beaver Gets Wood.  Gets Wood.  And finally, Harry Beaver and the One-Eyed Wonderworm.  Okay. Why don't you hold on just a second and I'll check the computer to see if we've got any of these, okay?  Alright, thanks a lot.  Sure.  Harry Beaver collection.  Let me come back.  Thank you for waiting. I checked our computer here and we don't own any of them. 
[37:00]
 I also wanted to see if anybody in the region has any of them.  Nobody's coming up with any of the Harry Beaver books.  And I also looked in our children's books in print for 1997 and I didn't come up with any Harry Beaver in there either.  That's awfully strange.  If it's really new, it may just be that nobody has it yet.  So no one has Harry Beaver yet? 
[37:30]
 No. It doesn't look that way.  Harry Beaver doesn't come up on the computer.  No.  Alright, do you have any of the Bobby series?  Bobby. Now, I'm not familiar with Bobby either.  Oh, there's one book on this list. It's Bobby Goes Muff Diving.  Do you have an author for these at all?  An author? Yeah, let me see here.  Oh, Anita Buschlicker. 
[38:00]
 Alright, here's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. What's happening, man?  This is Rick, the producer of the show. I'm sitting in for the guys.  They'll be back on Monday. In the meantime, it's the worst of for today.  Quick couple tunes. We'll do a bit in between both these songs and be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  FM Talk 1027WNEW. Allison Cheney. 
[38:30]
 Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Hi, boys and girls, and welcome to another edition of Stoner Spelling Bee.  Today's contestant is Ol' Dirty. Ol' Dirty, your word is inebriated.  Enebriated. Yeah, let's hear this one.  E-N-U-B-R-I-T-E-T. Am I good?  Enebriated.  Enebriated. R-A-T-E-D, yeah. 
[39:00]
 Enebriated.  Enebriated.  Yeah.  E-N-B-R-E-A-T-E-T.  Yes, that was right, yeah.  Okay, Ol' Dirty, since you're from the hood, use inebriated in a sentence and then try and spell it.  All right, use inebriated in a sentence.  Every time I go to the studio, I get inebriated.  Okay, now spell.  E-N-U-E-N-U-B-R-E-A-T-E-T-E-T. Yeah, man. 
[39:30]
 Enebriated.  Enebriated.  E-N-U-E-B-R-E-A-T-E-T. That's it, man. I don't know it, man.  Anyway, I know what it feels like. I know what it's going to be like. I know how to spell it.  And that's my word.  Enebriated.  E-N-U-E-B-R-I-A-T-E-T.  That doesn't sound like inebriated when you spell it.  See you next time and thanks for playing.  Opie and Anthony at 1027. 
[40:00]
 You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Anthony, the host has a great story on your favorite TV host.  Who would that be?  Star Jones from The View.  Ah, yes. I love Star. She's a diva, you know, Opie.  Whether you think she is or not, she says it.  So I guess it's true.  Diva. 
[40:30]
 Anyway, the headline reads,  Frankie View of Star Jones bash.  This is unbelievable.  Star Jones was nice enough to invite 60 friends to a barbecue at her summer place in the Hamptons,  but not all her guests were so nice.  One in-grade called up MSNBC to claim that guests weren't allowed in the house to use the bathroom, Anthony.  Instead, they were relegated to rented portable toilets on the lawn.  She wouldn't let the guests in her house to use the toilet? 
[41:00]
 No, she didn't want guests using her bathroom.  Well, I got a reason for that, honey.  See, my ass is so big, I got a custom-built toilet bowl.  It's as big as a jacuzzi.  And I was fearful they would fall in with their skinny, narrow asses.  I'm a diva.  Oh, you're a diva, all right.  Also, there were complaints from people that were at this party about the menu that Star Jones selected. 
[41:30]
 The menu? What could be wrong with the menu?  Well, Star Jones provided hamburgers and hot dogs for a guest.  Very nice for a barbecue, right?  Uh-huh.  But she reserved the lobster for herself, prepared by her personal chef,  which she washed down with some champagne.  She was washed down.  You can just picture her eating the shell and everything.  Someone goes for the lobster. 
[42:00]
 What a witch!  Oh, it gets better.  So she sits there, she sits there eating lobster and champagne.  Right, and she's giving her guests...  Everybody else has weenies.  Hamburgers and hot dogs.  Burgers and weenies.  Yeah.  And she gets the champagne.  I don't think she had champagne for everyone, Anthony.  No, probably haven't.  Just mix up some Kool-Aid for them ingrates.  Get the great Kool-Aid. 
[42:30]
 And then at one point, she told the chef to make sure that no one else got her lobster.  Ugh.  That that was for her and not the guests at a spy.  That's for me, diva.  It's star-stock.  Star-stock.  Star-stock.  You're in the portable toilet.  You mud people.  I'm a diva.  I use the bathroom in the house.  Uh, star-stock?  Yeah.  Star-stock.  Star-stock.  I don't know no Limp Bizkit, but I got buttered biscuits in there. 
[43:00]
 Oh, man.  Keep your hands off them.  I'm hungry.  Why do I sound like River now?  I love the red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Not the band.  I'm just eating red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Star-stock.  Mmm.  Tastic on.  Take a hand off if it even got close to her lobster and champagne. 
[43:30]
 I'm a diva.  And who would want to use that toilet?  Imagine going into Star's bathroom because you know the first image you would get is of her on that bowl.  With her big old ass.  Big ass.  It's hard for me to line up.  It's like AIM.  I got to use one of them, uh, one of those Norton bomb sites like they use on the bomber planes. 
[44:00]
 Just to line up so I don't hit the seat.  There's a lot of ass over here.  I'm a lawyer.  Here we go.  Let me line up.  Here we go.  Stay out the bathroom.  Star, I have to use the bathroom.  Use the tree out back. 
[44:30]
 This is Star's bathroom.  I'm a diva.  There's another one.  That was a whole claw from my lobster.  That hurt coming out.  That's lobster tail.  Look, it's hanging out.  Look, I look like a lobster.  Look at that. 
[45:00]
 Star, I really need the bathroom.  Use the pool.  Woo!  Damn, that's a tasty crustacean.  Uh oh.  Uh oh, this one's working out pretty good.  Hello, penis. 
[45:30]
 Stay out the bathroom.  I'm in here.  I'm a diva.  Fart equals funny, kids.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva. 
[46:00]
 I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva. 
[46:30]
 I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  So I found some mud by the portageons.  It was feces.  I was covered in feces.  Didn't you know when you were spreading the stuff all over your body? 
[47:00]
 Well, I thought it smelled, but I figured it was that hippie chick next to me.  But it was crap.  Oh.  And then I felt like I would be free and naked.  So I took my pants off and the girls laughed at me.  I went to the body painting and I had my penis painted.  But they thought it was a big joke.  They painted a shrimp on it.  So I had to walk around Woodstock with a shrimp dangling from me and everyone laughed at me 
[47:30]
 and beat me mercilessly.  And you had feces all over your body as well.  I'll forget that.  Yeah, okay.  So I was very injured.  Would Joe see the little fidget from Kid Rock?  Yeah, the little fidget from Kid Rock.  What about him?  He headbutted me in my sack bag.  And I got a rupture.  So I'm suing that whole band.  You're suing Kid Rock.  Well, they got a lot of money.  Oh.  And then I was in the portable toilet doing business and some roping group of hooligans 
[48:00]
 tipped it over on me on the door.  And I couldn't get out.  I was trapped for 12 hours.  I had to breathe through a toilet paper tube.  Well, they were trying to snorkel in a pool of urine and feces.  Well, they were trying to make more mud.  What can I tell you?  That wasn't on my brochure.  I got with my picket that I'd be with urine and feces for 12 hours.  Oh, and then I finally get out and I went to see Metallica. 
[48:30]
 Yeah.  And I put a nude girl up on my shoulders.  And I got cramps on the back of my neck.  Oh, and then I tried to get her up, but she was stuck there.  So I have a big hickey now on the back of my neck.  Are the crabs biting you as we speak?  Oh, I itch.  I have to shave my head, and now they've migrated south.  So I have full-fledged crabs. 
[49:00]
 So you got a peated penis.  Oh, like a shrimp.  Like a shrimp.  You got feces all over your body, and you got crabs that you had to remove most of your  hair at that point.  Crabs.  Right.  Okay.  I got my neck like a sucker fish.  You ever see those?  Yes, I have.  In your aquarium?  Yes, I have.  Oh, try removing that.  Hey, did you get hit by any of the tampons that were flying during the Red Hot Chili  Pepper set?  Oh, Anthony Kedis, still yelp to the women.  Yeah.  If you're on your period, throw your tampons on stage. 
[49:30]
 Yes.  Oh, I picked the wrong time to turn around and yawn.  Because I was turning toward the crowd to yawn.  Because you were tired.  Oh, and I think it was Fat Dottie that threw it.  Then someone set me on fire.  They set you on fire?  Yes.  More roving bands of hooligans with their candles.  And my glasses were on fire and my shoes.  Well, the candles were for a good thing. 
[50:00]
 What the hell were they for?  Burning place down.  It's what they were for.  Yeah, pretty much.  So now I'm burnt, covered in feces with the crabs.  And I got tampon in my mouth.  The taste that even Listerine doesn't make.  I hope they didn't dump out of that.  Who knows?  You never know when they're dumping out of our show these days.  That old gag.  That old gag, right.  Okay then.  Well, it sounds like you had a successful Woodstock experience. 
[50:30]
 I'll remember it forever.  All right, very good.  Well, thank you, sir, for calling us.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  This is one of the many people that got injured at Woodstock.  You guys can conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  All right.  Spaz trying to defend his manhood once again today after receiving a picture of Spaz in a bra. 
[51:00]
 Spaz having a real tough time explaining this one with all the evidence that has accumulated  over the months that you have been here at N.E.W. on the Opie and Anthony show.  What evidence?  We've run for a million times.  Two girls in the closet didn't complete on either one.  That dirty dance you do.  The girls that don't call you back.  Your lack of knowledge of women's anatomy.  I can't even go on.  And that's right off the top of my head.  And now a picture of you in a bra.  Now, yeah, a picture of you in a bra turns up where you're not fighting. 
[51:30]
 Your arms are up in the air.  You look like you're like, I'm free and gay.  I got my bra on.  I am not gay and I plan to prove that.  It looks like you're trying to raise the roof to a Ricky Martin song while you have a bra on.  Come on.  Yeah, look.  I mean.  Remember that was forced into that situation.  I did not do that.  Oh, come on.  Alcohol in my system, they forced it on me.  I love it. 
[52:00]
 Why are you taking his shirt off?  Look, Spaz is wearing a bra.  Why do we have a picture of you wearing a bra?  I can explain this.  I can explain this.  This is the same guy that found it fun to see me squirm.  Yeah.  Now, this wasn't months ago or weeks ago.  This was last night.  Remember that was forced into that situation.  I did not do that.  Oh, come on.  Alcohol in my system, they forced it on me.  I love it.  I am not gay and I plan to prove that. 
[52:30]
 I don't understand why I don't get chicks.  Come on.  I don't wear bras.  Just putting all the evidence together.  That's all.  Just another piece of the puzzle.  We have evidence.  We have evidence now of you wearing bras.  Just another piece of the puzzle.  Girls can't get Spaz off in the closet.  Now, we got pictures of him wearing bras.  You figure it out.  I won a bra last night and they forced it on me.  Come on.  I was struggling. 
[53:00]
 All of a sudden, I won a raffle.  I am on my knees and this guy and his stuff.  But I am not gay.  I couldn't fight him off.  I couldn't fight him off.  He is big and strong.  I would have fought any person trying to do that to me.  I am in front of the glory hall.  Right.  Right.  It was my turn because I won the chance to be there.  I couldn't leave because a bunch of guys were holding the door shut.  Excuse me, but I don't want to toot my own horn. 
[53:30]
 You know he is an actor, right?  He does these theater things.  So often he comes in and tells us he is going to be early for rehearsal.  What the next place Spaz is in is unique.  What does this play?  I don't know the name of this, but he plays a gay guy.  Wait a minute.  Spaz?  Yes.  You are playing a gay guy in the play you are in? 
[54:00]
 I am not sure if I am gay or hetero in the play.  This guy comes on to me and says he is going to do a taste for it.  Taste for it?  You are going to taste something else?  You are going to taste ass.  That is real life.  This is not a play.  It is an act, but there is no theater, no theater group, no actors.  Look at the evidence piling up against Spaz.  Now you are kissing men. 
[54:30]
 I am not going to kiss you.  Where is the line drawn?  I am not going to kiss you.  OJ looks innocent right now.  I know, right?  I am innocent, I tell you.  Come on.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.  I am innocent.

 Thirty-two pounds per square.  Thirty-two pounds per square.  Wow.  That's pretty funny.  That's something that should be left to other people.  Yeah, we should leave 70-year-old grandma.  I think we should leave on that.  A nice up note.  Oh, yeah.  Nice little laugh there.  All right.  This is going to go downhill from there.  Too late.  Phenomenon and

[61:00]
 We're like, oh, we take Monday and Tuesday off  Everyone's going to forget about us  Yeah, but we get a phone call  Guys  Look, it's going really well without you  Why don't you just take some more time off  That's good  We got the Slappy and Lappy show replacing you  Yeah, that's true  What else are we going to do?  We like just coming in here anyway  Well, the fact is our lives aren't that interesting when we're not here  This is our lives  What are we going to do?  Go to the Hammerstein and check out Fatboy Slim 
[61:30]
 With young 20-year-old chicks  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo  Look what I'm banging, Robin  This is fantastic  What a great story in the paper  Yeah, that is a killer, killer story  Are we allowed to talk about Howard or is the company going to get pissed at us  And say we're not team players  The company will get pissed at us and say we're not team players  But it's a news story, man  And god damn, it's a good news story  The man's in the news  Look at you, honey  Let me see those cans 
[62:00]
 This is hilarious  Suddenly single Howard Stern seems to be jumping back in the saddle with both cheeks  That's right, Robin  Stern, who was legally separated from wife Allison last month, showed up at the Hammerstein Ballroom Friday with his eldest daughters  To check out the DJ stylings of Fatboy Slim  The shock jock was just sort of moving to the music  In a private balcony box while his kids  Look at me boogie, Robin  While his kids raid full on  But after about an hour, Stern but his girls in a cabin  Return to party in earnest  Get home, I got a bang 
[62:30]
 The king of all media  Quickly called two women on his cell phone  Had their names added  Had their names added to a guest list  And danced with both at the same time  Stern soon focuses full attention on one of the lucky ladies  A 20-something  Yeah, Howard  I'm finally respecting the guy  God damn, a 20-something  With shoulder-length brown hair and a booming body  While the other girl mingled with the VIP crowd  Our spy, excuse me, says Stern was bumping and grinding with the mystery cutie  Until her friend resurfaced at about 12.30 a.m.  The three then left together 
[63:00]
 That's right, Robin  Not long after that, two other revelers had to be tossed from the private box  For engaging in a sex act  I took two chicks home with me  Baba and Buri  I'm so happy  I'm so happy  I'm so happy  I'm so happy  Giggle  Look at him  Now he's out  Wasn't that something he always just said he never did?  Like went out? 
[63:30]
 Now what did he do?  He took these two chicks to his  We don't know the place  Swank apartment?  We have no idea  We can just assume  Or imagine  The funny thing is  building is Regis. Yeah, some luxury high rise there. 
[64:00]
 I can't believe he's back in so long.  Howard, where'd you find these horses? They're all nighters.  Howard, I got to sleep. I got to put up with Cathy Lee and you're banging. 
[64:30]
 Shut up over there.  Two broads. Two broads, yes.  Is that Cathy Lee in there?  Howard, who are you banging?  My God.  That's something. He's getting something. God bless him.  Where's Joy? I hope Joy didn't go next door.  To borrow a cup of sugar. 
[65:00]
 Howard, you're not banging my wife Joy.  What's going on in there? Tell me, they're banging.  Tell me, what are you doing here?  You fag.  Hey, Scott, what's going on?  What's up, gentlemen?  I was there. I saw him for a few, but in the beginning he looked a little like a prey to everybody.  Yeah? Oh, yeah.  I think he must think he's something bigger than he is in his head or something.  I don't like going out in public, Robin. You know how that is. 
[65:30]
 I saw a couple girls. Every girl was talking to him.  Anyone could have wrote like a million checks for a dance.  Well, of course, every girl wants to be the first broad to bang Howard since the separation.  The funny part is when guys are there with their girlfriends and they find an excuse to slip away to go talk to Howard,  it's like nine guys alone, you know, hanging out with their girlfriends.  I invented dancing, you know.  I started moving my feet. All of a sudden everyone started moving and calling it dancing, Robin.  Can you believe it? Ripping me off.  Well, Howard, what do people do before dancing, though?  I just stood there. 
[66:00]
 Just stood there?  Yeah, music played and they just stood there. I invented dancing. Shut up, Jackie.  Well, what can I dance with you, too?  Hey, Sal, what's up?  I was at that Fatboy Slim concert.  Yeah, how was Fatboy Slim, first of all, because I missed the show.  He was great, man. He was fantastic.  He ripped me off, you know, that guy.  Fatboy Slim ripped you off, Howard?  That's right. I used to, I was doing the DJ thing.  Yeah.  And he ripped me off.  He ripped you off.  Absolutely. I invented Fatboy.  It is true.  I got a Fatboy in my pants, right, Robin? 
[66:30]
 Robin, woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  The talk you can't ignore.  Bob Seeger.  Good song, but it brings back some nightmares from past weddings.  When that one comes on at a wedding?  Yeah.  You can't even get up to go to the bathroom. 
[67:00]
 No, because if you walk near the dance floor, the drunken ant grab you.  Come on!  Still like that old-time rockin' dance with you.  You look like a jerk in the video.  And it's always the older ant that still thinks she's really hip and cool.  She wants to show everyone that she's hip and cool, so she dances to Bob Seeger  because she thinks that's, you know, today's music.  I like the new music.  Right. How about this one?  Oh my God, all the guys are shaking hands!  I am going to strap myself to the seat at every wedding I go to  because no matter what, I've got to sit there and beg. 
[67:30]
 While my arm is getting pulled up, dance.  I'm not dancing.  My chair is getting dragged.  They don't understand.  I don't dance.  I wind up cursing at relatives.  Get away from me.  I'm not going to dance.  It makes your ants go crazy, though.  You could be at the table, you know, and you're like,  I'm not going to dance.  It makes your ants go crazy, though.  You could be at the table with your friends and stuff talking about,  you know, what is going on with your life.  Yeah, man, I guess it's a really cool job at Andy W. now and stuff.  Yeah, it's working out really cool.  You know, most of the listeners hate us, but, you know, 
[68:00]
 every day we're getting some new listeners, you know,  and I think we could make it go at it all the time in the background.  Oh my God, Anthony, come on!  This is my very first dance!  I see you know your normal conversation is wrecked.  You're dancing or you don't even want to dance.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I want to do the kick line to New York, New York,  with a bunch of my drunken friends again.  Can't I just rent the video from 10 weddings ago and play it back? 
[68:30]
 Can you just dub that part in from whatever's wedding?  Come on, Anthony, why aren't you doing the conga line?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, let's all do the conga line.  Oh, let's walk around the tables and pick a get away from me.  Let's get really wacky and walk the conga line into the kitchen.  Oh, that's zany.  Wow.  Oh, look at Grandma.  She's 104 and she's on the conga line.  Look how cute.  Doesn't she look beautiful? 
[69:00]
 Look, you look beautiful.  No, you know what she looks?  She looks old.  It looks like an old lady in a prom dress.  The only place you see that is at a wedding.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.  Grandma doesn't look beautiful in the dress.  She looks old in the dress.  Back in the kitchen, back in the house coat, where we know how Grandma's supposed to look.  Oh, that was... 
[69:30]
 I'm not doing the chicken dance.  I'm not doing the conga line.  I'm not doing New York, New York.  I'm sitting here, get me another Bacardi and coat, and leave me alone.  Okay?  Thank you.  Know what I get at every wedding for my relatives?  Hey, Hope, you're a DJ.  Why don't you get up there and show them how it's done?  Oh, that's funny.  Hey, coincidentally enough, why don't you get in the back and flip some burgers?  Why do you think I haven't called you in five years? 
[70:00]
 Because you're an a-hole.  You still are.  No one noticed you went to the bathroom 20 times and you must have eaten a powdered doughnut.  There can't possibly be cocaine around your nose.  Yeah, it's 1998.  You're still asking me if I want to do a toot.  Get away from me.  Want to do a toot?  What are you?  What are you, 15?  Get out of here.  You realize that stuff will kill you?  What a dope.  Most weddings, I'd look around the room and I'd go, 
[70:30]
 You know, if I wasn't related to these people, I don't think I'd ever hang out with them.  Oh, the ants, they're fighting over who gets the centerpiece.  Oh yeah, that's a great addition to any house.  That's what I need.  Flowers in a gaudy pot with candy in it.  Oh, I need that.  Oh, you got to go get into the shop.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  1027. 
[71:00]
 Everything Robin says.  And you know, I got to admit, back when he first came out, what was it?  Late 70s?  Mid-late 70s?  Morgan Mendes.  He was on Happy Days and he fought Fonzie.  Oh boy, what an episode that was.  That was great.  Where Fonzie couldn't move because Mork froze him or something.  But Fonzie's powers came back.  Ridiculous.  Then his pinkies started moving.  At first, when they were in the middle of the fight, he froze them.  But then his pinkies started moving again. 
[71:30]
 But the power of A came back to life.  His thumb came up.  His A thumb.  What an A hole.  God, I can't watch.  But maybe the first season of Happy Days, when it wasn't filmed in front of an audience,  so you didn't have the, whoo!  When everybody walked in.  When there was Chuck?  Yeah.  Chuck was still there.  When he just disappeared and no one asked any questions.  There was no Chachis, no this one. 
[72:00]
 It was just stick to the guys and they would do things that was 50s oriented.  After a while, it was Leather Tuscadero and the Swades dancing.  What is that?  They all had the dry look from Gillette.  The 70s dos.  And then it's the 50s.  And then all of a sudden you get to see Jenny Piccolo and you realize that she's a pig.  All those years I was dreaming thinking Jenny Piccolo is Joanie's really hot lesbian friend.  And then she finally shows up and is like, ridiculous. 
[72:30]
 Fonzie with his thumb.  But we were talking about Robin Williams.  Oh yeah.  So that's when Robin Williams was funny.  That's when I got roped in too.  You'd see him do a stand up act maybe or see him on talk shows and he's going off on every little prop.  He picks something up.  Hey look, it's your doorknob.  And you turn it into an R.  And everyone's like, ah, Robin, did you see what the doorknob did?  And I'm laughing and then finally. 
[73:00]
 How am I laughing?  He's not saying anything.  Yeah, next time you see Robin Williams on a talk show, really take a close listen to hear what he's saying.  Oh, it's nothing.  He picks up a coffee cup.  Well, thank you.  I'll drink this.  I'm drinking coffee.  And my son, he drinks too.  He comes up to me and says, daddy, I got the coffee.  Oh, and it's so funny.  And the audience is rolling laughing.  I want to smack him.  He's not saying anything. 
[73:30]
 He's not saying anything funny.  Manhattan, the other day in New York, crossing the street.  I want to go see that man.  All right.  You cross the street.  Big sign, sign of road.  Walk.  Don't walk.  What do I do?  I don't know.  Should I walk?  Yeah.  Why?  What do you say?  What are you trying to say?  I'm a father now.  My young son comes up to me and says, dad.  Dad. 
[74:00]
 Hey, my kid does that too.  That ain't funny, right?  Robin's improvising again.  He's brilliant.  Oh, he's improvising.  There he goes.  He's off stream of consciousness.  Oh, look at me.  Look.  Look, I'm standing.  Now I'm sitting.  I'm standing again.  But he has to run all over the stage.  Let me run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to go up to the back.  Hey, hey, look, Davon.  I'm up here.  I'm up here now.  This is hysterical.  Funny stuff.  Well, what are you doing?  And he says, I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  Well, what are you doing? 
[74:30]
 And I got roped in years ago.  I would sit there in a room full of people laughing, going, oh, this guy is great.  He's not saying anything.  Richard Pryor, you get the MRFers and stuff, and it was funny.  Eddie Murphy, hysterical.  Right.  And then Robin.  Oh, look.  You ever see a dirty window?  You spray Windex and wipe it.  It's clean again.  Yeah, that's Washington.  And everyone's laughing about washing windows. 
[75:00]
 And he still does the same thing.  And people are in the audience.  All they're they're laughing their asses off.  Right.  At Robin.  The other thing about Robin Williams doesn't he do like the beard when he's doing the serious  roles?  Yes, you will notice Robin Williams in the serious role will always have a beard and  the comedy roles he shaves.  So I do.  So I have to work.  I shave and I'm funny.  Look at me. 
[75:30]
 Look, I'm shaving.  Look, I shave.  Now I have a beard.  I'm a serious actor.  Look at how I'm shaving.  So funny.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  I know.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  I know.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  I know.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  I know.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  You're making fun of it.  It's pretty.  Not funny.  All right.  Where are we?  Where are we in this mess of a radio show? 
[76:00]
 I don't know.  All right.  Can you tell we're excited to be back from our long vacation?  We're on vacation.  But then we came back.  We're away.  Nowhere to hear again.  Damn that Robin Williams.  Killing me.  What is it going to take?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change  the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony. 
[76:30]
 Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We've just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1027.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea.  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd give anything to eat me.  He sounds a lot like your father.  Your mother, Hillary, is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom?  Compassion? 
[77:00]
 No, a fat white ass.  Oh, well.  Your African name, Chelsea, is very important.  You're not going to be able to get away with that.  You're going to be a fag.  You're going to be a fag.

I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African Beaver.  Opie and Anthony, one, two, seven.  All righty.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of requests for that.  Hillary and Chelsea on Safari.  Got a whole lot of bits.  They keep coming in and they keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back.  They keep coming back. 
[80:00]
 We keep taking your requests.  If you've got any good ideas, stuff that we haven't played yet, because we're trying to  squeeze in as many different things as possible.  212-757-1027.  Also getting some great ideas off the instant feedback.  So keep those coming.  In the meantime, we'll take a quick music break.  All right?  And remember, in between each and every tune, we will be doing Worst of Bits.  Simple as that.  Let's keep it going now.  Worst of Obey and Anthony with Judas Priest. 
[80:30]
 FM Talk 1027, N.E.W.  The Obey and Anthony Show.  Oh, Obey, wow!  Boo, boo, boo!  More stupidity on the way!  1027.  I am Darth Malga.  Defy me and get a boot up your ass.  I am Princess Leia. 
[81:00]
 Get my helmet.  Martin D2.  Shut up, you little grunt, my friend.  I am Darth Malga.  Luke, I am your father.  Your mother was the worst **** they ever had.  If she did good ****, you wouldn't even be here.  When she dropped her pants, it looked like she had a weapon.  When she dropped her pants, it looked like she had a wookie and a leg lock.  Landon Foresy.  We meet again.  You'll be sitting in the back of the ship, you ****. 
[81:30]
 And you, drop it the heart, you fat bastard.  You can't even see the duck anymore, can you?  I am Darth Malga.  Yoda, make like a gerbil and crawl upon Solo's ass.  You look like a skeleton with ears.  My balls are as big as the death stone.  What do you want, you lint-blown ****?  You can't even get it up anymore.  Ha! I am Darth Malga, mother******* of the universe. 
[82:00]
 It's beyond moronic.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.  It's sub-moronic.  OPF 1027.  We deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of OP and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  OP and Anthony.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Kick it! 
[82:30]
 That's Cole Chamber, by the way.  Yeah.  Very cool band.  Rocks.  That rock.  You know, I wanted to take a musical break here.  Yeah.  Just not diggin' the music we have picked out today.  Grab something else.  We just did a really bad job picking out the music today.  Grab something else then.  I thought some of this stuff would be cool today.  It's just, eh.  Play something off the new Barry Williams CD. 
[83:00]
 What is that?  Have you heard any of that?  No.  It's frightening.  Barry Williams, the return of Johnny Bravo Anthony.  Imagine what a bitch it is being this guy, Barry Williams.  You're Greg Brady, and that's all you will ever be known as.  No matter what you try to do.  Like, he tried to get a singing career off the ground.  And that petered out.  And now he's trying again?  Johnny's back.  Johnny, the return of Johnny Bravo. 
[83:30]
 So now he's even milking a character he played as Greg Brady.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Remember that episode?  Yes.  He left the family.  Yeah.  They just wanted to sign Johnny Bravo.  Well, because the suit fit.  Right.  And he said, sorry, he's got to go solo.  But then it ended.  They were all cool and got the band back together, I'll be.  And sang, it's a sunshine day.  You know, we turned down Barry Williams for our radio show.  Maybe we should have him on so we could play the Joe Pesci game. 
[84:00]
 Or replay tracks from the new CD and then ask him if he expects to sell any of these things.  It's still one of my favorite things we've done.  Johnny's back.  You want to hear some Barry Williams, Greg Brady, as Johnny Bravo Anthony?  Is that what you're saying?  Hold on to your hat.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Groovy.  Johnny's back. 
[84:30]
 Johnny's back.  Ready to ride your town tonight.  Johnny's back.  Ready to dance till the morning light.  Join John with a great move.  Johnny's to the ship for the moon.  Charlie and Harry, nice dance.  Johnny's getting ready to dance. 
[85:00]
 Johnny's back.  Ready to dance in a waffle bean.  Johnny's back.  Get ready to dance with me.  And when he is gone, he's a long haul.  This is a goof, right?  I think he's serious.  Johnny's back.  Ready to ride his town tonight. 
[85:30]
 Johnny's back.  Here, Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  Here, Johnny's back.  Here we go, Johnny.  All right, listen, I can't hear anything.  Is there any other tracks on there worth trying out?  Happy Together.  Oh my God.  Happy Together?  Hey, Greg, it's 1999, almost 2000.  He's on the cover of the CD wearing his Johnny Bravo vest. 
[86:00]
 With his triple chin.  It's just kind of like fade into the real world.  Barry.  I can see clearly now the rain is gone.  I can see all obstacles in my way.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Are you trying to kill me?  Come on.  I'm dying here.  It's Johnny Bravo. 
[86:30]
 Let's go.  Come on, man.  I'm dying here.  I'm dying here.  It's Johnny Bravo.  Let's go.  Come on, man.  Oh my God.  I'm crying over here.  Please stop it.  End of magic.  This rules.  I think this is going to be album of the year.  Tell you the truth.  All right, have a good day, Onyx.  All right, man.  Hey, our listeners loving this.  Bill, what's going on?  Oh my God, turn this off or I'll slit my wrist.  Come on.  I can hear this one smash, man. 
[87:00]
 Come on, rip it out and smash it.  It's going to make you puke.  Oh, God.  All right, Bill.  Please stop.  They're loving it, Anthony.  It's very obvious here.  He covers a Huey Lewis song.  What track is that?  Let's see.  Hey, Luke, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is unbelievable, man.  I'm loving this thing.  You guys get so much props for playing this song.  It's hysterical.  Don't you love it?  Great radio.  I want this album.  I want this album.  The return of Johnny Bravo. 
[87:30]
 Does the record company really truly believe that they're going to sell copies of this  thing?  Man, I have a compilation that's called The World's Worst Records.  I picked it up just as a goof.  I want to re-release my own version, man.  This one's going to be the first song on it.  Well, Johnny is back.  And let it roll.  Here's the Huey Lewis remake by Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo.  Off his latest CD, everybody. 
[88:00]
 Talk it up.  Crank it up.  This is going to be a hit.  Used to be a relegate.  A relegate.  Used to fool around.  Yeah, with Alice.  I couldn't take the punishment.  I had to settle down.  Now I play in a speed train.  Yes, I cut my hair.  It fell out.  Crazy.  I don't even care.  But I can tell what's going on. 
[88:30]
 It's hip to be square.  Yeah.  Hip to be square.  Mike, what's going on?  I almost fell off the damn road, man.  Why?  I've got to stop this.  This is top shelf stuff, man.  Where can I get it?  You obviously don't know music like Anthony and I.  I apparently don't.  Well, I'm pegging this as album of the year.  Without a doubt.  Absolutely.  Hey, I'll send you the copy for Christmas.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  It's hip to be a renegade.  Yeah, that must have been the episode where it was caught smoking.  Johnny's back. 
[89:00]
 And what is wrong?  It's hip to be square.  There he is.  I would rather hear Corky say.  You got any other tracks off of that, man?  What is this one again?  I wasn't listening.  We are the champions.  We are the champions.  Ah, cool.  This has got to be good.  A little tribute to Freddie Mercury.  Rich, real fast.  What's going on?  Guys, I will do anything you need.  Please don't play another song.  Come on.  Come on. 
[89:30]
 I just watched some guy in a car slit his girlfriend's throat  and wrote, no more Johnny Bravo with her blood on the passenger side window.  That was Greg Brady.  Come on.  We're tracking through the new Johnny Bravo CD.  I think it's very important for Anthony and I to be up on our music.  So yeah.  You spin another tune, you'll be able to listen to me drive my car into this bridge.  Oh, really?  Let's try that.  All right.  I'm not kidding.  Ah, here it comes, Rich.  That guy is funny.  Vocal silent.  I've made my dues time after time.  Yes.  I've done my sentence but committed no crime.  And bad mistake.  There he goes. 
[90:00]
 I've made a few.  Making Freddie Mercury proud.  I've had my share of failings.  There he goes.  I've made a few.  done my sentence but committed no crime and bad mistakes I've made a few. 
[90:30]
 we are the champions no time for losers cause we are the champions of the world 
[91:00]
 Johnny Bravo let's go Johnny's back thank you it's a sunshine day everybody 
[91:30]
 smiling. should we try the sunshine medley before we move on here? I think we played one of the  songs we got to get to this sunshine day. oh it's Johnny Bravo doing a Beatles song 
[92:00]
 is this Johnny Bravo? yeah I think so. that's not him though. period. 
[92:30]
 alright so that's Johnny Bravo doing a Beatles song. he sounds a lot like Corky. no no no this is  Johnny Bravo. oh okay I was getting a little confused. Barry Williams yes. here's Johnny  Bravo doing poison ivy Anthony. oh he did that too? yeah he did. alright let me hear that. alright  from the new Johnny Bravo CD. yeah Johnny's back it almost sounds like that. and I'm ready to rock. 
[93:00]
 Johnny Bravo everyone. 
[93:30]
 it comes creepy, wow. She's pretty hesitating. Look at her, she's crazy. She's crazy. Do  you really do you mean? Let me get under your skin. Oh, it sounds like quirky man.  It's Johnny Bravo, Anthony. What's it like when it comes creepy, Joe? Wow. Look at that 
[94:00]
 guy. I can never get enough of that. I have to listen to Johnny Bravo do Poison Ivy.  I think it was a crack pipe they found in Greg's jacket. Greg, have you been smoking  crack? Mother, now you're concerned. Let me find another track from the Johnny Bravo CD,  Anthony. Wow, he does Mr. Tambourine Man too. Really? You didn't see that on the Johnny 
[94:30]
 Bravo CD when you were looking at it, Anthony? I just skimmed over it, I guess. Okay, another  one from the Johnny Bravo CD. Little different musical stylings here. Oh, it's showing his  range. Yeah. Musical intro. Sure. It'll kick in. Builds the drama. Oh yeah. Johnny Bravo.  Oh yeah. A little groovy tambourine. It's gone up a little slow. Give him that 70s feel. 
[95:00]
 Oh. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Man. I guess he didn't feel  like singing this one, Anthony. Yeah, really? What's up with that? Doesn't he do... Oh, 
[95:30]
 he's not sleeping. And there is no place I'm going to. I'm going to. In the jingle jangle  morning, I'll come following you. Because you're in a pool. What the hell is that? On  your magic swirling ship. My senses have been stripped. My senses have been stripped. What 
[96:00]
 was that? A little skip in the Johnny Bravo CD. I don't think it's the Johnny Bravo either.  Two nubs a step. Wait only for my foosies to be wandering. Wandering. Yes. Be my boy.  Oh my God. I'm ready to go anywhere except that pool. I bet my hair could let fall off. 
[96:30]
 I promised to go under it. Oh, I see. That wasn't Johnny Bravo. I think that's a good  one. Our own James T. Tiberius Kirk. That's right. Little Shatner doing, Mr. Tambourine  Man. I'm not sleeping in the place I'm going to. My booty has to be wandering. And one  last one from Johnny Bravo. Oh no. Hey, he's doing Bobby's part. I'm going to the same 
[97:00]
 place. Can't you hear me calling your name? It's the sunshine day. Everybody's smiling.  The sunshine day. Who the hell is ever going to buy this damn freaking CD, man? Wacky DJs. 
[97:30]
 We didn't buy it if it sent to us. I know. Gino, you're next on FM Talk. What's going  on? You guys are killing me, man. It's like kryptonite. I don't even have the strength  to go to the radio and shut it off. Listen, I got to hear Joe Pesci on the phone because  I missed it. I need Joe Pesci if it is. At the time Joe Pesci called to promote his CD  that was out last year. Yeah. He was putting out a CD of Italian songs and stuff. There 
[98:00]
 was a My Cousin Vinny rap or something. Yeah. We had him on the phone. A lot of people thought  it was Anthony doing Pesci, but I swear to God it was actually Pesci. Why not Joe Pesci  from Monterey Avenue? We made fun of him. Once you file away the Johnny Bravo, because  I'm sure there's hours of listening pleasure there. Give it to me over here. Johnny Bravo.  Yeah, this is a good one. I think we could do at least two or three more hours of radio 
[98:30]
 on Johnny Bravo. I want to keep this because I think after playing it just once like that,  the requests are just going to come flying in for us. Sure. I'll put it somewhere safe.  Put it right next to the Steve Lynch CD. You know. Oh, look. You ever see a Johnny  Bravo CD come apart like that? A little platoon reference. I see that. Yeah, this is Joe Pesci  from a year ago calling our show to promote his CD. Check it out. Is this Joe? Yes, this 
[99:00]
 is Joe. Joe. Who am I talking to? Hope or Anthony? Both of us. What are you guys talking  about from the same neck? Pretty much there. Connected like Siamese twins. So Mr. Pesci,  I got your CD in front of me. How do you like it? It looks great anyway. It looks good.  I saw the commercials for it this morning. I'm laying in bed. I see commercials for this  thing. I'm like, what the hell is this? What is Joe Pesci doing? What is this all about?  Well, I just, you know, Tommy Mottola and I from Sony decided, we talked a long time 
[99:30]
 ago about doing this. We thought it might be fun to hear a guy from the neighborhood  sing all different types of songs, you know. So I did it as Cousin Vinny and did it with  a Brooklyn accent so we could have some fun with it. And we did a little parody on some  songs that people know, you know. Would you guys shake down some drug dealers for this  cast and put this together? Oh my God, I don't know. Doing Mottola? I don't know what to  think of this, to be honest with you. Why do you have to play and listen to it? What  do you mean you don't know? All right, all right, we could do that. What song do you  suggest we play? Why, I think your Cousin Vinny would be good. Excuse Opie, Joey. He's 
[100:00]
 not a, you know, a Paisan. No, he might not understand. You'd be shoving me in the back  of a car, I think. Well, you can play Wise Guy, too, the rap thing, if you like it. And  we'd like to... Are you Joe Pesci rapping? That's it. I wrote a thing called Wise Guy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone? No, I could. You don't know how hard that  is. Those guys are really good. I didn't know how hard that was. Yeah, a little white Italian  guy can't rap like a black guy. No, I did it as a white guy. All right, wait, I'm going 
[100:30]
 to have to hear Joe Pesci rapping. This is Wise Guy off Joe Pesci's new CD. Check it 
[101:00]

[101:30]

[102:00]
 out. I hit it. I hit it in time. I hope so. Come on, challenge me. No, that's it. Come  on, I'll give you another plug for the CD. No, that's it. You play it. That'll be enough  of a plug. Hey, thanks. I appreciate it, guys. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. Take it easy, Joe.  Bye. Bye. Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot. Oh, come on, mom. Don't bang Opie. You 
[102:30]
 my mom. I'm yours. I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a hell of a jibonging ride. Opie and  Anthony. A couple of evil bothers. One Opie seven. Opie, you're a sick ass man. Anthony,  you're not a jackass. You're obviously a style. The Opie and Anthony show. It makes me sick.  One Opie seven. All right. Quick programming note. I forgot to mention a whole lot earlier. 
[103:00]
 Yesterday, I mentioned that we'd be doing one. I entered. I play within studio coming up  in the five o'clock hour. OK, that's your that's your warning. So if you want to make  sure you check it out, if you caught me part of it, heard about it, but never heard it  or anything, if you just want to check it out once again, because it's so freaking hilarious.  And I'm adding a section to it. I found another section from Dice versus Dice. So when the  real Dice man confronts Anthony coming up in the five o'clock hour, in the meantime,  we've got some other great stuff. It's the worst of the open Anthony show. Now more of 
[103:30]
 the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at one oh two seven. The talk you can't ignore.  It's written from the perspective of a priest that I knew many years ago when I was going  through some trouble times. I went to him for some advice and love advice and sure he  helped me out a great deal. No person. Great.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear. I kneel upon the floor. Temptations of a Catholic 
[104:00]
 priest. Easy to ignore. But I cannot control myself. It rips my soul apart. For one small  sheep among my flock has stolen the shepherd's heart. Alter boy, alter boy, confess your 
[104:30]
 sins to me. You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. And someday my survival  will be so class. I catch him in my view. So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread 
[105:00]
 eagle on the pew. And when I see him in that rock, my conscience goes awry. I'll give him  some communion wine. That's spiked with Spanish fly. Alter boy, alter boy, is it gonna be  heaven or hell? You can play my organ all night long if you promise never to tell. Oh, 
[105:30]
 mother, what mother? How will it be thy name? I could dress him up like the Pope and then  I'd, oh dear God, the shame. No, no, lead us not into temptation. Deliver us from sin. 
[106:00]
 We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ and I was Mary Magdalene. Alter boy, alter  boy, confess your sins to me. You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. Oh, alter  boy, alter boy, confess your sins to me. You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[106:30]
 The 
[107:00]
 Pope and Anthony show have been removed from the airwaves. Oh, that was it. I shouldn't  have offended too many people, right? I didn't swear. Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 1027. 
[107:30]
 My girlfriend, Nora. Yes. Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hi. You're on the air there. Are you gonna hang me out  to dry? No, but please, come on. What? You agree with Anthony? Yeah. Let's just, you know, fix 
[108:00]
 this. Yeah. Yeah, all right. Well, first. You're Italian at home. What are you talking about?  Thank you. Am I a minute man, Sandy? No. I think you're practicing that tantric thing.  Practices. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. I'm not Italian. Really? Yeah. What's  his name? Oh, wow. Sandy, you remember when we first started having sex, though, right? 
[108:30]
 Yeah. After our first date. Yeah. No. Why is your brother ready to punch me? Because.  Remember, though, it was like it was a lot quicker. Yeah, but that was. Well, that's  the point I'm trying to make today. When you first start going out with someone new that,  you know, it's hypersensitive and, you know, you don't last as long. Yeah, you got a point  there. I don't know what Anne was getting at all today. I was getting at giving Chris  Haller some advice that you learned during the years. You know, it was two different 
[109:00]
 pieces of advice given by Opie and I. And all of a sudden it turned into this whole  thing. I don't know. Since the minute woman. I am not. Tell Rick to close his ears because  I am not. Well, what's wrong with being a minute woman if you were? Because I'm not.  I mean, that means you can't, you know, you can't hold out. You can't hold out. You're 
[109:30]
 really good. Shut up. Why? Because I know he's listening on top of everyone else who  listens to your show. What, your brother Rick, who's sending a foot from me? Yeah, look,  he's got his sleeves rolled up. With a big arm. Yeah, Rick, steroid boy, get over there,  man. He's like standing over me, making sure I don't say anything bad to you. All I was  saying with the whole finishing up quickly so you could recover for the next time and  then proving yourself thing is it takes the oral factor out of the mix right after that. 
[110:00]
 And that kind of, yeah, because what guy is going to want to submerge if that's the case.  So you got to work around that. Yeah. I apologize. I haven't done that lately. I cannot believe  you. I apologize. Well, Rick is right there. You don't enjoy that? Oh, no, I do. I don't  know what I just haven't lately. I just got this. What's wrong? You don't need to discuss 
[110:30]
 it. What's the matter, Alpie? What? No, there's nothing wrong with that. I just, you know,  I just, I don't know. Why aren't you doing that? I just haven't. What's the matter? She  gave me a home last Friday though. Oh, no. Oh, no. Emergency. Oh, no. Get out of the  way. Are you crazy? That's okay. Probably only lasted a minute for Alpza. We can't discuss 
[111:00]
 this. Wait, well, you better discuss what he just said because it was, say it. It was  like two minutes. No. I'm not going to say what I want to say. Say it. What do you want  to say? It's going to take me out to dry. Did I last a minute? No, you lived longer.  A little longer? Yeah, but I was almost getting like lockjaw. Why did you almost get lockjaw?  What's the problem, man? Nothing. Too big? No. Like no? She says no real quick. I'm going 
[111:30]
 to get locked up. Why did you almost get lockjaw? I'm just kidding. Oh, all right. It's just  a joke. She was flossing her teeth. Lockjaw. Sweets, I promise I'll, you know. All right.  We don't need to discuss that. Well, I know you like it and stuff, so. How did Alp? What?  He's not getting that, man. He's turning red. Well, I mean, I don't want him to get a visual.  Oh, you got to do that. What are you doing? I have, right, Sam? Sam? Not lately, I know. 
[112:00]
 You're telling the listeners that Tuesday Night Hummer Club guys were asking you to reciprocate,  and then what? You're not going below the covers there? How long, sweet smug? A while. Oh, B?  Come on, man. What? That's fair, because I don't always do that either. Right. So it  works out. Sam, how's my technique, though? Which technique are we talking about? My earl 
[112:30]
 technique. Why do you have to get back on that? Because I'm really curious. No, it's wonderful.  Oh, it is good? Yeah. It's not like I'm like, you know. Not that convincing. Like Sam Kinnison  said, it's not like I'm just painting a fence. No, you're not painting a fence. Sam, thanks  for cleaning it up. I'm not a minute man. No, you're a stallion. I'm a stallion. My  earl technique is pretty good. Yes. Oh, he's earl-taking. You know what I mean? He's a pretty good  just ask any guy. It seemed like you finally are starting to enjoy the doggy a little bit. 
[113:00]
 Oh, man. Look, Rick's right here. Well, just see. What? Oh, Rick. Because when he said  that, instantly everyone gets a visual, including Rick. You don't need that. See, now that's  going too far. What? The reach around was a hit. I hate. We have a problem. I'm dogging  your sister. Get over it. Oh, God damn. What's the problem? That is not right. That is just 
[113:30]
 not right. How could that possibly be a problem? You can't put it like that, man. You can't  do that. It's intact. You've been doing it for six years. It's about time you found out  that I'm doing her. I don't think I need to hear about the certain positions that you're  into. You got any videos now? Shut up, Chuck. Chuck is making it into the studio. Hi, Chuck. 
[114:00]
 Hey, man. I just came back from beer. All right. I'll let you off the hook. There's  a lot more I want to say. I think I've said enough. I don't know if you're letting me  off the hook. Like what? Well, doggy. Even he's doing it that way. You should lose it.  Thank you, buddy. All right, Greg. What's up? Yeah. Yeah. Do me a favor, Anthony. From one 
[114:30]
 Guinea to another, take over the show. Rick, take this boy backstage. Smack him. How dare  you? What? Smack the blonde out of this boy's head. Talk about this man's sister like that  on the radio. Wait a minute. You're not even married? Rick, as one man to another from  the gym, please, smack the dyad out of his head. That's pretty bad, huh? I'm seething.  Anthony, from one Guinea to another, how dare you let this man talk like that about this 
[115:00]
 man's sister? What? Well, you know something? It's none of my business. Get your hand on  that button ready. I've been going out with her for six and a half years. I don't give  a god. Excuse me. I think at this point, Rick can handle the fact that I'm dogging a sister.  My brother-in-law has been married 10 years to my sister. He talks like that. He ain't  going home with feet. I mean, that's not the... Smack him. Spaz was supposed to punch me yesterday.  Now you want Rick to punch me? What? Punch you? My friend, you're talking about this man's 
[115:30]
 sister like she's some kind of pig. And Sandy, you're listening. Shame on you for calling.  Shame on you. Sandy knows that. Anthony, you're Italian. You understand? Yeah, I had a stand-up  comic, Dog and My Sister. All right. Please, Rick, smack him. Go Yankees. You guys are the  best and you're sucking, but Rick, you swallow if you don't hit him. I can't let that be.  No. Well, he's going to get... He said, here we go. He said I swallow if I don't hit him. 
[116:00]
 I got to hit him. You got to hit him? I got to hit him. Wait, if he said jump off the  Brooklyn Bridge, would you? No, because that's stupid. Rick, you really do have reason to  hit him. You should hit him. No, he doesn't. You should hit him. Hit him. I have every  good reason. Hit him, man. No, Spaz had every reason to hit me yesterday. Rick, hit him.  You have no reason. Dude, I've got a great reason. You know how I treat you. No. You  know how close they are as a family and stuff? They're very protective of each other and you  say you're dogging her, doggy style. Shut up, Rick. I mean, shut up. Shut up? You know, 
[116:30]
 the truth is though, Rick, if he wasn't married to me, it would be one thing. Shut up. Shut  up. You see how big the dogs are? Shut up. Dude, you don't lift weights. Shut up. Shut  up. It's true. Yeah. Shut up. Test run those arm muscles, man. He's a steroid boy. Shut  up. God bless you, steroid boy. I'm telling you. I am not a steroid boy, for Christ's  sake. The steroids mess with the brain. You're going to have man boobs. You've got man breasts.  Sorry I don't spend eight hours a day at the gym. Go get yourself a bro. A man's ear. What? 
[117:00]
 A bra? It's a bro. It's a Seinfeld reference, right? Right. Seinfeld reference. It's the  bro. It's the bro, Jerry. Now you've gone too far, man. You've gone too far. A bro?  Get away from me. Sit down. I said every right yesterday. You're right. I think I want to 
[117:30]
 punch him. Hit him. Where would you hit him, Rick? Joey, shut up. I don't know if I can  hit him in the man boobs because my hand might get swallowed up. Wait a minute. Joey, just  remember who does your live reads. You think Ann can remember all that info? Ann, we just  remember Ann. I know everything about Pizano. Excuse you, jackass. I know everything about  Pizano. Why are you hanging me out to dry? Look how big he is, man. I'm not that great.  I know everything about Pizano, Joey. Who's down there more, me or Opie? I've got to say 
[118:00]
 Anthony's in there. That's right. Come on. I know who you like better. That's all right,  Joey. He's taking me to the game tonight. Yeah. We've got to stick together. Go with  the Polish guy. Someone get Rick out of the way. I feel like I've got to hit him. Rick  looks like a cage tiger right now, man. He's stalking you, man. You know what it is? He's  in conflict right now in his head. He knows he should get up and show me what he's saying.  Shut up, man! But there's some kind of conflict because he does genuinely like Opie and doesn't  want to hurt him, but there is quite the reason to hate him. What if he looks like he could 
[118:30]
 snap you like a twig? What if you say something bad to my sister? I'm not going to say about  your sister. I'm not banging her. I'll call her up. I can take care of her. Can I bang  your sister? Let him bang your sister. She's six months pregnant. If that gets you off  you, you sick ass, then go for it. Yeah, he's the sick ass. Wait, I thought you liked that.  Yeah, you're the one that likes that crap. I thought you were the preggers, man. Wait,  Rick, let me ask you though. Chuck. No, I just don't know. Like Spaz, if you were to 
[119:00]
 hit Opie, would he have the power to fire you? Because like him telling Spaz to hit me was  like, my wife going, I know you cheated on me. Just tell me. It'll be okay. Technically,  I have the power of veto on anything else besides and vice versa. Listen, I don't want  it to come down to a firing thing. That's just beyond... Then let him fire you one.  No. Let him just tag you. Rick, sit down! Jesus! Sit down! Let him just tag you one, man. That'll  be kind of cool. That's one shot. You guys will still be friends. You feel like brothers 
[119:30]
 now. Yeah, yeah. One shot. Look how big his freaking arms are. You know, brothers used  to wrestle around. Maybe I can give you a wedgie. How does that sound? How about I give you  a wedgie? That's a little homo, man. That's a homo thing. That's kind of a homo doggy  style, dude. Ant, shut up! He said he did your sister doggy style. Oh, man. That's just  a... Rick, sit down! Ant, shut up! I got to say, hey Rick... The locked jaw statement.  Hey Rick, my son... The reach around. Shut up! The reach around. I forgot about that 
[120:00]
 one. The reach around. Wow, what a guy giving her the reach around. The reach around was  working, if I recall correctly. The reach around was working pretty good. Banging her.  If you're going to... Using the word banging. Hold on. Wait! Not making her... Oh my God.  Oh, Rick. Oh, Rick just threw the chair. Oh, Rick's sister's getting mad. I'm in the corner.  Spaz, hold on a second. Hold on. I do have one thing to say. Doggy style. Hold on a second. 
[120:30]
 I got something to say. Just remember. Put the bottle down. Dude, you freaking hung me  out to dry. What did I do? I'm just repeating what you said to the man. Rick's about to  break that bottle. It's going to look like a black exploitation film in here in a minute.  What did I say? You forgot to remind him that Sandy did say that. I was good at oral. Oh,  Rick's got him down. There is no contest here. There's no contest. Rick's got him totally. 
[121:00]
 Oh, Rick's trying to get away. There's no way Opie can get away. No way. You got him  around the neck. Opie's trying to get Rick's arm from around his neck, but it is not working.  Rick is totally dominating this brawl on the floor. Opie cannot get away. He's got one  hand. He's trying to hit Rick on the back of the head. Opie just punched Rick in the  side of the face. Rick is spanking his crotch in Opie's face. He's got a great grab on 
[121:30]
 the back of the head and he's flipping him over. Opie having a hard time recovering from  Rick because Rick is on top the whole time. Oh my God. Wait, Rick's pulling Opie's pants  off. Opie now getting really pissed. He's totally ready. He's got Rick in a headlock.  He's pissed. Two points for the reverse. Two points for the reverse. Opie can't seem to  get Rick down though. Rick like a bulldog. It's very hard to get Rick down. Opie working, 
[122:00]
 but I think he's tiring at this point. Rick's endurance is going to start taking over now.  Rick obviously dominating this brawl. Opie getting a couple of good shots in, but Rick's  sticking his crotch in Opie's face. I think the most degrading thing I've ever seen. He  looks like Opie's head was a marshmallow for a second. Rick is up. Opie's still down. Hey,  Rick. Hey, how you feel? Somebody call a medic. Somebody call a medic. Opie almost 
[122:30]
 gave me a rusty trombone. How you doing, Opie? How you doing? How you doing? Opie's pulling  his balls. Opie putting up a valiant effort, but Rick, he's hard to take down. He's like  a little fire hydrant. A bulldog. Dude, watch that. One song comes to mind. Come on, come 
[123:00]
 on, come on. Yeah, that's an appropriate song. You should have been playing it while you two  were on the floor. Opie, what did you think when Rick put his crotch right over your face?  I was just thinking that... Gee, his ass smells terrific. Wait, what was the question again?  What were you thinking when Rick stuck his crotch right in your face? I was about to 
[123:30]
 say, oh, no. No, don't say it. I know what you're going to say. I know what you're going  to say too. How much you like your sister. Sorry, I had to do it, man. I had to do it.  Oh, Rick's coming over. I'm going to kick your ass now. Going for the black guy. You  know, his arms are big, but I've never been on the white guy, and he's fine. Oh, what 
[124:00]
 a joke. Holy cow. He's pretty rough, huh? About the first time I had so... No, I would  say it. Because I need to say his last name for the joke. Yeah. Oh my God. I didn't do  too bad. Look, your headphones are broken. I got them. Your headphones are totally broken.  Your glasses are on the floor. It's like you're just a mess. You know what? Opie's pretty  good. He can hold his own, man. I got to give it to him because Rick's a big guy. At one  point, I did see Opie reached around and punched Rick in the side of the head. I think he 
[124:30]
 was trying to get his arm around the back. He punched you in the side of the head, and  then Rick just lost it. You were like a rag doll at that point. Rick's got some power  to him there. That mega mix. Look at his arms, man. I knew I had testosterone powder. I knew  there was going to be a problem there. It looked like a prison cell workout. Opie was  queen of the weight room ball. You go to sleep when I tell you to go to sleep. But 
[125:00]
 not after you toss myself. Wow. I've never seen a bra like that in this studio. I wish  I had gas. Oh, man. If you were to squeak one out, if you could have, you would have.  Oh, yeah. Using the animalistic sitting on the opponent to try to... What the hell was  that about? That's what monkeys do. I was hoping to squeak one out. Those swollen ass  monkeys do that to dominate. I do want to stay for the record. He was trying to give 
[125:30]
 me a wedgie. Dr. Zayas did that to me. Zayas from the Zier and Cornelius made me look like  a monkey. Red monkey ass all over my face. Damn him to hell. That's a long time coming.  Yeah. A little tension there, huh? It's a hell of a lot less tension here now, though.  I'm breathing a sigh of relief. I'll get some tension out tonight. He doesn't quit. I didn't 
[126:00]
 quit. What? That doesn't mean anything. What, you're going to roll around with another man?  Come on. It's a joke, isn't it? I'm all for violence sometimes. Hey, you guys are a bunch  of hoes. God, I want to punch you in the face. You better leave a bruise. Why not? 
[126:30]
 You guys are going to burn in hell.  All righty. It is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. We're going to play a couple  of quick tunes. Why drag it out? Dice is up next. When Andrew Dice Clay visited the studio  last summer, confronted Anthony about his impression. Some classic radio. So make sure  you're listening. Coming up after these two tunes. Crank it up nice and loud. Here's 
[127:00]
 Allison Chains. The worst of Opie and Anthony FM Talk 1027 and EW. Now, more of the worst  of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Yo, babe. How you doing? It's Baber is live from hell, everyone. How you doing? You got  any hoes there for me? You all right, babe? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
[127:30]
 I'm in hell. How all right could I be? They got me coaching a little league team down  here. You're coaching little league in hell? Little f**kers can't even play or drink. They're  not even interested in hoes like I was. By the time I was six, I was not going to have  got left and right. A bottle of booze in one hand, this shit hurts the dreaded other. 
[128:00]
 You know, they invented the voice box just for me. Yes, I know that. The electric voice  box. It was actually an accident. What do you mean? Well, some chick I was with was  using a dildo and I accidentally went down on her and realized I could talk. Come on,  you little f**k. Hit the ball. Jesus Christ. Hey, badda, hey, badda, hey, badda, f**k 
[128:30]
 you. Hey, babe, have you seen your pal Lou Garret down there in hell? No, that pussy  was a good guy. He went up to heaven. He did, huh? Yeah. He died of that Lou Garret disease,  you know. Yeah. He's one of the odds of that. And I take a little prick. Hey, we're going 
[129:00]
 to get together with Billy Martin and Michael Kennedy tonight for happy hour. Oh, really?  Billy's driving. Billy's driving. You can see Michael's face. It looks like my legs.  Jesus. Yeah, it's a little gross. Whoa, whoa, what's wrong, babe? Babe. I got spilled a beer  in my voice box. My wife's going to kill me. Wait, babe, you're married? I did say I was 
[129:30]
 in hell, you know. Babe, babe, babe, babe. Oh, there he goes. Babe roots, everyone. Opie  and Anthony, 1027. Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony. On FM Talk  at 1027. Andrew Dice Clay entering the studio, Anthony. Where is he? Whoa, there he is. He 
[130:00]
 looks like he's... Hey, Dice. What was that? Get the snowball. What did that mean, Mike?  You're doing this. No, no, no, we'll explain. See, he's a bastard. I'm not a bastard. He's  an obnoxious bastard. Okay, so who's the guy that does me? Anthony. Do you? I don't think  I'm going to do you. All right? You know, that's not bad. That's what you said last  time I did you. That's what I said last time. That's almost better than me. The only difference 
[130:30]
 between you and me is about 35 million. I hope you still got some of that. Yeah, I got  plenty of it. Yeah? That's why I could afford not to wear sleeves. What's the matter? Why  are you tongue-tied? I thought we were getting along. No, we are getting along, but we got 
[131:00]
 to have fun for the people in their cars going home that have been at work all day dealing  with the Chinaman boss to listen to something. Well, okay. I got some clips of Anthony doing  you. Yeah, let's hear some. You want to hear one? When a bad mouth shows. What? He's very  sensitive. I don't bad mouth. It's an homage. I think that homage, what does that word mean,  Kenny? It means that he bad mouth shows. Yeah, when he says you're playing chuckles for 15 
[131:30]
 people. Oh, wait, that was my choice. And it wasn't chuckles. It was Lanthiaballs off  in Poughkeepsie. No, I, chuckles. I did two albums in front of 15 people. Yeah, yeah.  See? In the fields. But you know how many people bought those albums? How many? Take  a guess, Jericho. A million. Take a guess. So you addressed me in the proper fashion.  I'm not going to talk. All right? Well, I didn't mean anything by Jericho face. What 
[132:00]
 did you mean? That's like a compliment. That's when you become friends. All right, asswipe.  I could roll with that. See, that doesn't hurt me. No, I know. That's like a nice thing  for you to say. You can wallow, wallow in your millions and you don't feel bad. Because  like that to each other, you see? I don't call the farmer, you know, J-O face. He hasn't 
[132:30]
 earned that from me yet. Maybe we relate right away. Maybe me and you could do a show like  doing my twin or something. Or he's not as handsome. He could be the evil dice. He's  got the goatee ready. Yeah, you know what I mean? We could do like a sitcom on some network  that might have me. The handsome dice and the retarded dice. I guess you'll be playing  the retarded dice there, Kenny. Look at this guy. What is with the hurt feelings all of 
[133:00]
 a sudden? Come on. Hey, Kenny, I found the clip you were talking about. Why? Let's see  it. I'm going to be laughing to your crap your pants coincidentally enough in Allentown,  Pennsylvania. Where did that come from? No, what I like is coincidentally enough. Because  that's another word I don't understand. Never said. That was never said, huh? No. So where  are you performing this weekend? In the bathroom alone. Where are you performing? I perform  here all week. Do you do stand up comedy? No. Why would I want to travel the country? 
[133:30]
 I call you jerk-off face. Staying in lousy hotels. Well, I say in the best hotels. When  you're dying. Maybe back in 88. What now? Holiday in? Best Western? Little bit. Little  bit now. What's the matter? Now it starts coming your way and the dice man gets a little  pistol. No, wait a minute. Maybe if you find your own personality you can make a living 
[134:00]
 doing stand up comedy. Personality? Let me hear you say that one. Say it. I don't know  what you're saying. You say to me you got a good personality. Say that. Just say that.  You got a good personality. Now until you learn that you really don't have the impression  down. So I'll try it. I don't think people are going to pay me here. That's not what  I said. I said personality. Now I ask you, you got a good personality. That's not what 
[134:30]
 I said. Where's this personality? Personality means you got a good personality. Nice, you're  making no sense. I'm hearing babble. What you're saying makes no sense. What I'm saying  is a statement. Why is there dead air on the air? Why are you talking now? Talk to me when 
[135:00]
 I talk to you. I don't understand the word you're saying. Personality means you got a  good personality. Now everybody driving in that car is explaining. I understand. How  come Jerkoface don't understand? Again with the Jerkoface. I'll be on radio stations all  over the country. I'll promote you. Anthony Jerkoface. I can't even do an impression of  you because I haven't heard you yet. I heard Opie. How do you not kill your parents? How 
[135:30]
 are you doing? This is Andrew Dice Clay. I got a lot of personality. Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma. 
[136:00]
 What? What? It's not making fun. It's talking. It's a parody and I'm going to let it go.  What did I do? What did you say I should get mad at? I don't get mad. Wait a minute. I  don't get mad. So tell me. We got some... It's usually, hey I sold out Madison Square  Garden. They haven't called since but I sold it out in record time. Stuff like that. Nothing 
[136:30]
 personal Dice. You're a character. You're a character. It's like I'm a walking cartoon.  That's what I'm saying. It's like I'm not even human. I'm a cartoon to you. I'm a few  laughs for you. I'm not around and you can just say whatever you want. That's what this  guy's saying. Now I'm glad to hear you say it. Who is he to call up and look to start 
[137:00]
 a problem? Get up between me and you. Yeah, you Jacob. I don't understand this guy. What's  wrong with these people? Everybody's looking for a beaten. I got more examples of Anthony.  Let me hear some. Oh Christ. Come on. Jack be nimble. Jack be quick. I ain't been funny  since 86. Now that isn't even true. Now that isn't true. Now wait a minute. No, no, no,  no, no, no. See that was done with computer generation. Look at me. If we went to court 
[137:30]
 of law, what was your answer just now? That's not true. That was computer generated. Now  what do you feel about me? As you Anthony Dice. This person, first of all, that's a  little, I don't think you did the Rodney thing until maybe 87. So it's not even like logistically  correct. It's 88. 88. Right. See? That's right. And you were hysterical. Mr. Clay, I got another  example for you. Okay. Hey, this is Dice man. I used to be somebody. Now I can't even sell 
[138:00]
 out a closet. Hey, now wait a minute. Now when was that? That was before I went to governors  and saw a packed club of raving fans. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Before you say I  got forgiven because of what he just said. What? What he said? Well, you had disappeared  for a while. Okay. You had to yell. You know something? I was a big fan. Shut your mouth.  Kenny, when was the last special? HBO special. Assume the position. When did it air? Three 
[138:30]
 years ago. Okay. What year was that? 96. Okay. You said 86. You said 86. Kenny, how many  homes tuned in in 1996? 95%. Okay. Who's tuning in for you if you go on TV, Anthony? Dice,  your parents? See, it wasn't Andrew Dice. It was the Dice character. You're a character 
[139:00]
 I'm mocking. Oh, I get it. It's a cartoon. The cartoon guy. It's like Fred Flintstone.  You don't have another example, do you? Oh, sure. All right. Andrew Dice Clay, I'm available  for weddings, bar mitzvahs and sweet 16s. How did you know I was doing those? I'm not  even bang the boards. Now come on. How did you know I was doing those? I'll try a nice  one. That must be a treat, huh? Hey, read the Torah. See, he's an instigator. I didn't  say nothing, Mr. Clay. You know what the funny thing is about this whole little thing 
[139:30]
 with him? That he's calling himself Andrew Dice Clay. And the other funny thing is I'm  going to sue you. No, this is what I'm leading up to. Don't get the punch line away. When  you use somebody's name, number one, that's called like, what is that word? Infringement.  That's one. Defamation of character. That's two. So here comes another 35 million from 
[140:00]
 the station that hired you. Now, we'll probably have to settle. You'll probably lose your  job and be with the hot dog stand downstairs. But I'm still going to love you because I  know it's a goal. Would you like another example? You got one? Contrary to popular belief, the  Dice man can read. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute now. Here. I'm going to read out  this educational magazine I'm looking at with a chick and a bikini called Stuff. And just 
[140:30]
 the fact that even though it's big ladies, I was able to read that. Anthony, we are in  Dice's Court of Law. Did I not read that word correctly? Yes, you did, Dice. And I  you in fact, the person that said that on that recording he just played. Yes or no,  Anthony? It was taken out of context. Yes or no, Anthony? Did you say those words? Yes 
[141:00]
 or no. Answer the question. Yes, out of context. Okay. You know what? Since it's out of context,  why don't you play us a little more? I sold down Madison Square Garden. Hey, we got the  Olive Garden checking in. I think they got a spot for you. Is this the Olive Garden?  Yeah, this is the Olive Garden. How you guys doing over there? All right. Do you want to  talk to Dice? Yeah, I'd like to speak to the Dice man. Hey, Olive Garden, what's your problem?  Yeah, we want to know if you could sell out a table of four. Table of four? Are you insulting 
[141:30]
 me? Are you insulting me? You don't think I could sell out a table of four? Let me tell  you something. Last week I was at Burger King, 15 p.m. All right? So don't tell me about  a table of four. What time? All right, Olive Garden. All right, peace. Bye. Hey, call me.  He took the call. Look, he's calling himself Dice again. Kenny, that's another 35. I'm  keeping track. Now, wait a minute. This is all done in a spirit of fun and laughter. 
[142:00]
 Okay. And I'm going to laugh when I see what the hot dogs stand. I'm going to come up and  I'm going to go, Anthony, look at you now. Yeah, sauerkraut on that bun, all right?  And then I'm going to go, Anthony, do me a little. Do me a little. Say you're me again.  That's what I'm going to say to you. And then your wife's going to leave with me in a nice,  big stretch limo with the jacuzzi in it, champagne in the back. We put on one of my house tapes. 
[142:30]
 We get all licked up and crazy. And she'll be throwing my hot dog out the window. Look  at this, Anthony. He does have the apple and it does look like a zebra. Hey, my Merry Christmas,  New York. You're listening to Andrew Dice Clay, not, you know, the wannabe. Anthony.  Toby and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay and. All right, we want to take another call? Yeah, 
[143:00]
 we can do that. Maybe you'd like to speak for me. Since you're so used to it. All right.  Mike, what's up? Anthony, when are you going to play at my grandma's house? All right,  that might have been a club that came up in conversation. We got a nice thing here by  my grandma's house. Well, we got a few more. Oh, come on. I thought we were through this.  I'm going to take your asses off up in Poughkeepsie. How many people? And ha ha, I just left in  my sack, taking. You're all alone now, Anthony. You're a makeup comedy club. That is a field. 
[143:30]
 Look, he would make a comic book that you would be appearing in. Is that what it is?  Now, look. The cartoon is going to play anywhere. We sit now. Let me be straight. We see the  Dice Man 1988 bust. Open the scene. Rodney Dangerfield special. Like you break. You have  to become the biggest comic ever in history. That's what you're saying. Right. So how do  you keep that level? You can't. I rest my case. I know. I converted from the jury. But 
[144:00]
 then what? No, I'm done. I'm done with the case. Well, we could take the next call now.  But then what? I didn't do enough for you. No, I just think you've been coming up with  plenty of material because of you. Exactly. See, you you you reach a huge place. But don't  you make a performance to try other things in a career? Of course. I mean, I did about  900 arenas. How many did I do to make you happy? The bit is your attitude is still like, 
[144:30]
 I'm good medicine square garden. I'm the biggest selling comedian of all time. But that's the  bit. Is that the bit? Yeah. Oh, okay. Hey, Rana. Well, Mr. Clay. Mr. Clay, I got an example  of Anthony trying to come up with new material for your career. Oh, okay. I got to say this.  Do you have any new material before you leave Dice? All new stuff. I do new rhymes. Oh,  let's hear one of your new rhymes. You're Bill Clinton and Monica. It's funny stuff. 
[145:00]
 Yeah. Number one. Top shelf stuff. You're wetting your pants over there. Oh, I'm wetting  my pants. All right. Number one. It's a Linda Tripp poem. All right. So now you'll be smirching  my material. Be smirching. Tripp poem. I don't know what that one means. Be smirching. You  understand when I do the Linda Tripp poem, they'll be calling you and going, why did  you not do the Linda Tripp poem? You were just making something up. Weren't you? Perhaps 
[145:30]
 that that will happen. Yeah. That's the way it's going to come down. Yeah. See, I didn't  want to get into this. Oh, he's all because of him and Rick. I don't know how much you  dumped it, but get into it. It's your life. Dice, the people get a big... I don't know  how much this woman lives with you. People get a big kick out of it. You walk around  the house and go, honey, cook me some eggie. You know, now it's time to go to the... You 
[146:00]
 know, I'm going to take the dog out for a good boy. That's exactly in my head. I'm going  to be impersonal. He means you're cooking the geese and got personal. I don't know  even know exactly because that takes true talent to figure that out. Say it. I can't.  I can't. I don't even know what you said. Then you will be asked that in the court of  law. The court of law. So personality, because still you could do that. This lawsuit will 
[146:30]
 be pending. Dice, remember I was the one who helped you out. Now remember... Now wait a  minute. You're in it too. I'm going to get you out of this little, you know, 10 by 10  minute lawsuit. You'll be traveling around with me, club soda, Murray, happy face, a  couple laughs. I said Murray. Bring the broads and bite the dozen. You're going to have to  unload this chick. I'm sorry. I mean nice girl and everything, but they're all over  the place. I don't know why you had to start all this, man. I have a little bit of fun. 
[147:00]
 See, but the only thing is that in his favor is that he does a good impression. He does  many others by the way. Who else you do? I can't remember now. Charlton Heston. Charlton  Heston? That's more of a goof on Charlton Heston than really Chuck Heston. Wait, what  are you saying is what you're doing is not a goof? I try to think of that as a more accurate 
[147:30]
 interpretation of your voice. I think he does good up in Charlton. Well, those are all like  parodies. He does like Charles Caroll really good. What are you doing with parodies? What  was he doing on me? Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan he does real well. But Ronald Reagan  won't even know it anymore. Yeah, that's true. That's why it's fun. I don't know. People  that pop by just wait until they pop by. Nobody cares. It's a cartoon, but then again, like  he has said on the radio, I am a cartoon. I'm not a human being. I'm a cartoon. How 
[148:00]
 you doing? This is Andrew Dice Clay. And you're listening to, no, not Anthony Dice Clay. Andrew  Dice. And you're listening to Hopi and the Guy Who Wants to Be Me Show on WNEW 102.7.  Hi, N.E.W. Yeah, hi. I'd like to speak to Popeye Dice Clay. I'm a cartoon. I'm a cartoon.  Popeye Dice Clay? Yeah. Hey, olives. How's your busky? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Huh? 
[148:30]
 Hey, Pluto, you bloated piece of crap. Huh? Look at you, you fat bastard. Oh, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey. So the sea head comes up to me and she goes, hey, Popeye Dice Clay, I  want some of your cocks. Oh, and gah, gah, gah. So I give it to her. Hey, gah, gah, gah,  gah. There you go. Now let's hear it the other way. Just finish, man. Oh, ah, gah, gah, gah, 
[149:00]
 gah. So this chick comes up to me at the bank. Oh, and I put my tongue in her ass. Ah, gah,  gah, gah, gah, gah. Oh. We went to fight. You were rooted. Oh, kicked his ass. Oh, man.  All right, man. All right, dude. See you later. All righty, what's happening, man? Hopefully  you guys are enjoying the stuff when Dice was in studio. Now usually that's about it. 
[149:30]
 But I was digging through some more tapes and found when Dice called back, he left the  studio, said goodbye to the guys, blah, blah, blah, the whole boring thing. And he was down  in the street and somebody pulled up in a car. I guess they knew he was coming out of  the building. They wanted to meet him. They had the show on in the car and Anthony starts 
[150:00]
 doing some more dice after Dice had left the studio. So this is like, this is like a whole  soap opera. So Dice gets on his phone and calls back into the studio right in the middle  of a spot break. So this is where this phone call comes from. It's like 10 minutes after  the last of when Dice left the studio the day. All right. So here's something you've  never heard before. So I've only heard once if you even heard the original interview.  All righty. It's when Dice called back during the spot break to confront Anthony about doing 
[150:30]
 more impressions. Now more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on SM Talk at 1027. What's  the matter? I'm walking in the street. People pulled up. It's still on in the car. And Anthony  don't know what to stop. I think I had a problem with me. You should have said it right there  and then I gave him the opportunity. The fans called in. They said, if you got a problem 
[151:00]
 and I took it, all right, the guy's cool for the last. And now you open your mouth again.  I didn't say nothing. You said plenty. Hey, listen, Jericho. You come back here. Well,  I'm the Jericho. Maybe you're the Jericho. OK? You don't want to do this. I tried to  come on the first. See, I'm never the one to pull the first punch. That's not me. Like  even like all the Jericho's that called in, all the tough guys that are in their apartment 
[151:30]
 stone going, my life means nothing. So let me insult somebody else. Is that what I'm going  to start? Is that what I got to start thinking about you? Or do I think I had a guy that  does a bit of pressure. If he could get a few laughs off of it, let him get a few laughs.  You tell me what you want me to think. It could go two ways. Where friends feel it as  a problem. And if I got a problem, you really got a problem. Hey, I hear you. You don't  want to die. We left everything with nice. Good for everybody. I saw your wife downstairs. 
[152:00]
 I gave a quick squeeze and a kiss. You know what I mean? I called the town. I thought  it did a good impression. And now I'm walking down the street. God knows what I'm going  to do. You got to hear this guy. You got to hear this guy. I was listening in the freaking  car over here. I got to go. I got to whip the streets with this nonsense now. Everybody's  coming out. Go with it. If you have a problem, let them say it. Dice, it's Opie. I'll confess 
[152:30]
 that. We got to make up. Here's a hot chick walking by me now. Honey, want to be on the  radio? I'm sorry. Thank you. You're too good for everybody. I'm your man on the street  now. Honey, can I clear the air? I'm sorry. I'm over here now. Thank you. You know what  I mean? I've left everybody on the street. I've put all kinds of people out. Hey pal,  what's going on? Did you hear that guy? I'll go over to another guy that's actually very  mad at you for what you did. What's your name? His name's Cliff. Hold on. Who do you think 
[153:00]
 you are? Who do you think you are trying to overpay? You're a issue to him. You're a issue  to him. All right, Cliff, fine. You don't have to deal with this. Can you get this guy  out of here? Hey Dice, can you talk to these people in the middle of the street for us?  This is the middle of the street. I don't even know where we are, but we've got some  high looking numbers walking on. No, Dice, I'll go on record and say I consider you a 
[153:30]
 pal now. All right, so we are friends and when I come back to town, I'm coming back  in there and I want to hear more of these clips. Unless Howard makes up with you. What's  that? Unless Howard makes up with you and then you'll be on Howard's show. No, no, he's  got to be a man and apologize. I said that to the guy calling in. I don't owe him no  apology. You know what? You guys are fun. Well, a lot of people thought that we should have  beat you up or something. I don't get that. But you were going to come in here and beat  me up. Isn't that funny how everybody's brave when they're on the phone or when they're 
[154:00]
 on TV but the minute they fake you, all of a sudden they clear him up. You know, we had  you in the studio and I'm like, hey man, I like this guy and he's making people laugh  and we had some fun. That's all I care about. Who's this now? I'll beat you. Yeah, Anthony.  You're the even-tempered one. Well, Anthony, I've got no use for you. I like people with  emotion. All right, Anthony, let him have it. Anthony's got a lot of emotion in him.  He's got a lot of problems, a lot of pent-up anger. I don't like the farmer. Hey, Dice, 
[154:30]
 because of you, Anthony, that changes shirt. You're meant to count. The only thing I've  got to milk is between my ears. You know what I'm saying? The bus driver's just looking  at me. He's looking for a beat now. I just passed the high-looking redhead and you know  what they do for me. What? Oh, me and Jack are going to keep the guy for a puzzle hour.  All right, guys, I'm going to let you go. All right, please don't make me quit back. 
[155:00]
 All right, Dice, come see us again, all right? That's right. I'll be looking for you. All  right. Don't worry, I know just where to find you. All right. All right, goodbye. Take  it easy. How you doing? This is Andrew Dice Clay. And you're, no, not Anthony Dice Clay,  Andrew Dice. And you're listening to Hopi and the Guy Who Wants to Be Me Show on WNEW  102.7. 
[155:30]
 Here's the worst of Hopi and Anthony on FM Talk at 102.7.  Jerry. Yeah. Hey. Can we get the rusty trombone? There's all kinds of names for things. What,  Jerry? Okay, I'll be ready. Be very careful. It's the rusty trombone. It's, you're getting  your salad tossed and the girl reaches around and starts playing the trombone. 
[156:00]
 That is the rusty trombone.  I thought I heard it all.  The rusty trombone. That's the rusty trombone. All right. 
[156:30]
 A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore. She'll beat you around and get you off with  her hand. All the while she'll lick your spot by your tiny balloon nut. Hope you didn't  eat too much bran. A rusty trombone may not be moral. While I think this sounds kind of 
[157:00]
 gay, I'd rather get some oral with the finger up my butt. But that's me. What the hell?  I'm not. Come on, honey. Stop the music. Yeah. You play that well.  Opie and Anthony. Cunnilingus and psychiatry brought us to this. On FM Talk at 102.7. The  talk you can't ignore. What's going on with Kathy Lee Gifford? I read a disturbing little 
[157:30]
 article in the Post today. Yeah, I was looking at that too. It seems like her viewers are  very, very pissed off at her because she's been going topless on the show. Or braless?  Braless, I mean. Yeah, she's wearing these little dress numbers and letting her boobs  swing. And yeah, gravity is taking its toll on Kathy Lee. Are they hanging below the coffee  table they have set out? Not yet. Kathy Lee, put your bra on. Don't let look at these. 
[158:00]
 They're hanging like sweat socks full of sand. You think the nipples point down on those  babies or what? I really can't tell. You know? They just look like they're getting elongated  is what it is. They look kind of long. I don't know. I think she's trying to get attention  because now Regis has this new TV show, I Want to Be a Millionaire. And for some reason,  I guess the rubes in the Midwest are all tuning into this thing and it's taken off. All the 
[158:30]
 rubes that call them up on this stupid show in the morning. We have the question, Gellman.  What's the question for God's sake? Yesterday, Tom Selleck was on. What commercial did he  first star in? Regis and Kathy Lee, this here ass, I'm teared up and I live in Wyoming and  I listen to you. I watched you some other day on channel 4. Well get to the answer, you  slutbag! Kathy Lee, look at her pants! They're on the coffee table. The same rubes. And they're 
[159:00]
 watching that new show and now it's a huge hit. So Regis has a hit on his hands. So maybe  Kathy Lee is getting jealous and trying to flash some skin. Well, maybe people pay attention  to her. Maybe she should turn around and show everyone her balloon knot. That's a ratings  grabber, I'm telling you. Kathy Lee, show your balloon knot! Gellman, look at her balloon 
[159:30]
 knot! And then Kathy Lee can turn around and give Regis the rusty trombone line on the  show. Gellman, I'm getting the rusty trombone! And then Regis can turn around and give Kathy  Lee the dirty Sanchez. Let me reach around and get some on my finger! Gellman, look,  she's got a mustache! That's the dirty Sanchez. The dirty Sanchez! And then Gellman, because  he's such a tool, can get like the Cleveland Steamer. A Cleveland Steamer, Gellman! Tony 
[160:00]
 Pinstripp and Gellman are Cleveland Steamer! Could happen, right? No, that's not the same  thing. I might tune in to see all those hijinks. Let's rehash real fast. The post saying that  Kathy Lee is now going braless. Tell me you wouldn't tune in every morning if you knew  that between now and the Millennium... Tug it, you bitch! Tug it! I love it! Just hear 
[160:30]
 me out though. Between now and the Millennium, this is their new promotion for their show.  You're almost hitting prostate! Gellman! Oh my God! You've gone too far. I love it.  So the big promotion is now between the Millennium, Kathy Lee will perform live on the show, the  rusty trombone to Regis. Tell me you're not watching every day waiting for that to happen. 
[161:00]
 Where's the reach around, Gellman? Kathy Lee's giving me what? The rusty trombone!  Dig deep, you bitch! And then the grand finale, Gellman gets the Cleveland Steamer. You're  watching every day! Art Moore's giving him a Cleveland Steamer! And who gets the dirty  Sanchez then? Kathy Lee! My Roy's are acting up, Gellman! She's giving me the rusty tuba! 
[161:30]
 Sometimes Joy Fielden gives it to me! You watch though, right? Right? Like tomorrow  on Regis and Kathy Lee, Kathy Lee's going to show everyone her blow-knots. You're watching,  right? Oh, I'm there! You're there, of course! I can't believe it, Gellman! I'm getting 
[162:00]
 a rusty trombone! If they could see me now with the rusty trombone, sing it, Kathy Lee!  She's playing it! I can't believe it, Gellman! And look at you with your Cleveland Steamer!  And Kathy Lee with a dirty Sanchez! 
[162:30]
 Art Moore has pruned! He's giving the Cleveland Steamer! I love the rusty trombone!  Well, we crack ourselves up. That's what's wrong.  Eddie, what's up? 
[163:00]
 First of all, her boobs aren't sagging. These damn things started, I'd say, almost down  to her belly button. Have you ever looked at her and saw her boobs are in the middle  of her body?  That's a freak show!  There you go!  I can't believe it! I've never seen cans like this! But not the broad rubs on her thigh!  Wow!  What's Mr. Container doing here? 
[163:30]
 Don't even try to figure it out. Just go along with it.  What happened?  All righty, what's happening, man? This is Rick, producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sitting in for the guys. We are doing the worst of all week in the midst of some awesome  stuff that we just dug up. Lots of requests for Dice. Take care of all of it when Dice  is in the studio. If you missed it, too bad! We're moving on. We've got more stuff coming 
[164:00]
 up. If you've got any requests for the worst of show, 2127571027, Spaz is the man on the  phones. He's telling me that we're getting a lot of requests from Mad Dog, from a particular  group of people who, I guess coincidentally enough, work with Mad Dog.  Wow, what a coincidence! I guess they don't get enough of them if they are in the studio.  They've got to hear our version of them as well. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but 
[164:30]
 I think that's really freaking funny. So to appease our fellow brethren and I guess company  coworkers in Queens, here you go by request.  It's FM Talk 1027, Talk You Can't Ignore. Our phone number is 2127571027. We have another 
[165:00]
 exciting show planned for you guys today. Mike and the Mad Dog talking about David Cohn  signing a one-year deal for the next four hours.  We're going to be talking about that for an entire Mad Dog show. What do you think  he's going to take? What do you think he's going to go with the big bills every week  for the Bay? What do you think, hundreds and fifties? Or do you think a lot for the tens 
[165:30]
 and twenties? How is this man getting paid? And what's he spending his money on?  So Bill will talk about that until you're sick of it.  I think he's signing a contract with a big ballpoint. We'll take your calls on that.  You think you should use a fly pen of a big ballpoint, Mike?  Hey Mad Dog, how are you going to compete with Opie and Ethel? They're going to have  a girl give birth on their show today.  Jesus. How am I supposed to do this? Get shot, giant shot, neck shot. How am I supposed 
[166:00]
 to do this? Mike, you fat bastard, you pregnant? You've got to be. Mike, I'm going to stick  an oven stuff a roaster when the sun don't shine. Deliver it like a kid. It's the only  way we can compete. Get me out of here. My ratings are slipping.  And then on Gay Rock they've got 92 minute rock blocks all afternoon and here we're going  to try to have a girl give birth. We can't promise it's going to happen but we're definitely  going to try.  I'm going to try to start doing imitations. Hey, it's time broken, John. 
[166:30]
 Alright, Mad Dog, let's hear your time broken, John.  Alright, hold on, I'll get your music.  I want music!  Hold on! You're really getting uptight, man.  Well, you know, when you do sports talk radio it's a little rough when your teams are stuck  to ass. I always smoked out a news app when we had the Yankees and everybody turned it  in. Everybody loved the Yankees. Not even the Yankees. We can't even talk about the  No baseball for the month. The teams stink. I've got to compete. I've got to win. 
[167:00]
 Alright, so you want to do voices now on your show.  I'm going to give it a whirl.  Alright, you want to do it?  I'm going to do it.  Alright, Mad Dog, you want to start with your broken jaw?  I'm going to do what they call a little riffing.  Alright, let's start.  I'm going to do a little time broken, a little news break.  How you doing, time broken, John? Everything nightly news?  Why can't I say a kill me Volvo? Wait, I can't even say a kill me Volvo. 
[167:30]
 Jesus Christ, this is hard. I'm going to have Mikey Dice Clay.  Alright, let's hear some clay.  Hey, E.G. So I'm out here with this chick and she's got her tongue going.  Well, I can't even say that.  Oh!  Hey, that works. I can do Popeye.  Let's hear your Popeye.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Hey, that's not bad.  I don't do that bad.  Alright.  Well, blow me down.  Let's hear a little more.  Blow me down, Mikey! 
[168:00]
 Let's hear some more broken jaw.  Everything nightly news, time broken jaw.  Time slumming.  Hey, let me look at the paper. I'm trying to lip. Lip.  Turn over the paper. You're not used to seeing the front page.  Oh, look at that.  You go right to the sports page.  Everyone's happy. Coney's back in Pinstripe for one more year.  Right. Then on the other side of the paper.  Hey, what's this?  Wow, this is serious news.  I ain't never seen nothing like this before.  What the hell? 
[168:30]
 People are dying.  What are you talking about?  And a poor kid hit by a bus.  Right.  Oh my God, a banker.  Right.  Set on fire.  Right.  Oh my God, Joey Adams is dead.  This is awful, Mikey.  What about the Cuban?  Wait a minute, I have no impression of Corky Mad Dog.  What about the Cuban kid?  I think he's on a sign.  Really?  He probably a baby, a damn good left hander. 
[169:00]
 All right, thank you.  Reverend Allen has been arrested.  I am outraged.  I am outraged.  You want to try Reverend Allen, Prussian?  Yes.  I am outraged.  I am outraged.  Why is the white man always picking on me, Mikey?  Damn you, damn you out of hell.  Look, I'm doing Heston.  Oh, you want to do Heston?  Mikey, give me monkey ass.  I want red medical monkey ass. 
[169:30]
 Is this working?  Check the ratings.  Hopefully we're winning.  I think I got a niche for this voice thing, Mikey.  You're not bad.  A little more on Heston.  Damn you out of hell.  Take your dick and fart out of me, you damn dirty ape, and you're too, Mikey.  Damn you, damn you.  I remember when I was on the planet of the Apes.  I had shit for the monkey.  Check the ratings.  How are they?  They've got to be coming up.  This is brand new to me. 
[170:00]
 All right, I got one last impression for you.  All right.  Ah, look at my camel toe.  Look at my camel toe, Mikey.  Check this out.  Look at the yanking dung out.  Look at the size of this thing.  Look at the clem out.  You got to imitate Celine Dion.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I sent this song out to those who lived during the tragedy of the times. 
[170:30]
 A special song goes out to Das Have I Got It.  Das Have I Got It.  Slumped in by Carroder.  Would you like to do the dirty voice for everyone too?  Yeah, yeah, you got a bitch on the phone?  I call the bitches to get the rakes.  I say bitch, you know scumbag, bastard. 
[171:00]
 I gotta start using that blue language.  We gotta get in trouble, Mikey.  Yeah, I'll be an Anthony, always in it.  Always bad.  Always getting in the world of crap.  Until we get some kind of complaint, we almost get fired.  We can't even compete.  Get abroad on the phone.  Alright, let's talk to Tina.  Hey Tina, get out of my mug and my dog.  I'm gonna use my dirty girl voice on you.  Hey, you're my dirty girl. 
[171:30]
 You're a filthy bitch.  You're getting off, aren't you?  You're my dirty girl.  You like it, don't you?  You gotta slow it down a little, bad dog.  Hey, it's Hummer Tuesday.  Why don't you come over here and get Mikey a Hummer?  You can use it. You look a little backed up.  Fuck, see? I'm getting blue.  Hey Tina, you give your boyfriend a Hummer?  My husband?  Your husband? Your whore?  You're my fucking whore! 
[172:00]
 Look at me. You like it?  I don't know if the dirty girl voice is working.  You like me, Tina, don't you?  Sure.  You're my fucking whore!  And I'm like the nice man.  Hey Mikey, you wanna see my junk?  Mikey, give me a Hummer!  Alright.  Well, I think you're almost there with your impressions, man.  Don't let me compete! 
[172:30]
 Alright, let's take a quick break.  We'll regroup and we'll be back.  Me, Opie and Anthony show.  Throw men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  That's you from Mike and the Mad Dog.  Who you guys beat. I'm glad you did.  I guess we beat them in the ratings.  Yeah, you beat them in the ratings.  Opie and Anthony are out of credit.  They came out pretty strong in the late part of the year.  And they're kicking ass.  I mean, what does? 
[173:00]
 We're looking like little bitches.  What do you think about that, Mike?  I'm feeling like a little smack bitch.  How long are we supposed to sit here?  Why do they get naked midgets in the ass?  How are we competing against that?  Unless you get something like the Knicks playing at the playoffs.  Hopefully we'll get a subway series.  And that'll compensate for girls shooting stuff out of who knows where.  Hey, we can compete against that!  It's terrible, isn't it? 
[173:30]
 We have to talk about Coney Pitchin'.  Hey, you got smack Pitchin'.  Hey, Mikey.  Why don't you give me a rusty drum bound?  No, that's okay.  Now give me a dirty stanchard.  So I can feel the ratings going up already.  Give me a rusty drum bound!  I remember the time I was in the back of a Tarot-er.  And got a Cleveland Steamer.  Oh, really?  What was his name? 
[174:00]
 Mikey!  We gotta give him a lot of credit.  After a lot of hot dogs at Yankee Stadium.  Sometimes I can still smell it.  I'm still laughing at that last line.  So yeah, that was for Mike and the crew at the other station.  Did I say Mike?  No, I'm just kidding. 
[174:30]
 Not really.  More of the worst stuff on the way.  Including some broken jaw.  In the meantime, here's a quick little music break.  Worst of all, be it Anthony, FM Talk, 1027.  I'm still laughing at that last line.  So yeah, that was for Mike and the crew at the other station.  Did I say Mike?  No, I'm just kidding.  Not really.  127.  So be it, Anthony.  127.  Mr. Sullivan.  Yes, is this the two idiots? 
[175:00]
 Yeah, you want to sue us?  Yes, I would just like to inform both of you gentlemen that there will be a lawyer talking to your management team.  Because I have been not only embarrassed, but harassed.  Really?  Do you understand this?  And don't even go close by saying thank you to the Short Hill Malls.  Because let me tell you something.  This has been a disgrace.  You have your malls over there in the city.  Don't you have ghetto malls over here in Newark?  Don't be coming through our malls and doing something like that. 
[175:30]
 You hear me?  Yeah, what else?  What else?  Yeah.  Okay, I mean, what?  Isn't that a shame?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Hello, sir.  Sir? 
[176:00]
 Mr. Sullivan?  The sorriest thing is, right before he hit him, he goes, what's that, a train?  Sir?  Did you hear that, Shelley?  I heard it.  He goes, what's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Damn, that's funny. 
[176:30]
 I'm being kind.  I think there were a couple hundred last year.  Yeah.  So when does it start?  11 o'clock Saturday morning on Malcolm X Boulevard.  I've been Harlem if you feel so inclined to show up. 
[177:00]
 Malcolm X Boulevard.  Stay away, Whitey.  Stay away, Whitey.  Crapper alert.  Crapper alert.  No crapper zone.  It is a crapper free afternoon on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem this Saturday.  When was the last time you were up there?  Who, you kidding?  Who, me?  It's been a crapper free zone for many years.  I was just up there, let's see, when was I up in Harlem?  Yeah, Rick makes a good one.  Friday, Friday, on my way up to Massachusetts.  Because I had a cut through Harlem. 
[177:30]
 How many red lights did you go through?  I don't pay attention to traffic signals up there.  I don't pay attention to roads.  I will drive on the sidewalk.  I mean, I'm going up on the sidewalk at one point.  There's someone who's like,  Whoa, my baby, look out for my stroller.  Crazy ass, hog ass pecker.  Look out.  You can't even tell where the roads are.  Oh my God, I had like,  the whole front of my grill was  Colt 45 labels from when I was just going through  garbage pails and stuff.  Why? 
[178:00]
 Why? Rick makes a good point about the Million Youth March.  It's going to start at 11 a.m.  and it's going to be done at 11 a.m.  Wow.  So, Khalid Muhammad opens his damn mouth.  And we must kill the lot.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right, everybody, disperse.  What did he say last year?  He said, grab the cop's guns  and use them against the...  How is this guy getting another permit?  Right.  If somebody can say that  and then you wonder why cops shoot, 
[178:30]
 this guy was telling people  if the cops come in to break up the  controlled riot against the police,  they're going to be like,  Controlled riot against...  I don't know what that is.  To grab their guns  and use them against the cops.  What the...  How do you say that and then the next year  you're granted another permit?  Freedom of speech, Anthony.  Unbelievable. Hallelujah.  Freedom of speech. And Khalid's like,  My brothers, yeah, rise up, 
[179:00]
 rise up, grab the gun.  Ooh, the cops are here, let me run out the back  where I won't be seen for months.  The guy disappeared.  Reverend Alstain away too?  Yeah.  He makes all the black leaders of the 60s and 70s  really proud.  Oh my God. Khalid Mohammed?  Khalid Mohammed.  I don't know, he won't...  Guess where I won't be Saturday?  Come on.  Malcolm X Boulevard? 
[179:30]
 Yes, Malcolm X Boulevard.  Alright, Vanjie,  we love Vanjie. Oh wait, I didn't go to Vanjie, hold on.  Vanjie, who lives in Harlem.  On the line. Vanjie, what's up?  Hi, how are you doing?  We haven't talked to each other in a long time.  You sound upset, Vanjie.  No, like, first of all,  why are you talking about like we got  country roads up here?  Where did you go through?  It's not country roads, I think you missed the point.  Wait, wait, no,  I'll be completely honest with you. 
[180:00]
 When  I'm a white person like myself,  I'll speak for myself.  When I'm driving through Harlem,  I am scared  S-less. So what I do,  and Anthony does it too,  we drive through red lights and get the  hell out. Cause I don't understand it.  You know what,  there's part of the, let me fill you  in. There's part of the, you know  that white conspiracy?  What white conspiracy? Well, there's a white  conspiracy against black people, 
[180:30]
 remember? Oh, yeah. Part of it is  we can run through red lights in black  neighborhoods and we just wink at the cops  and they let us off the hook.  I'm sorry I had to fill you in on that one.  But that's part of the white conspiracy.  Oh.  What street are you going through that you're so  terrified?  When I'm going like, you know,  back up to Boston to visit and stuff, I just  can never find that damn FDR, man.  All of a sudden,  I'm like on first ab  or something, I'm like, oh, there's gotta 
[181:00]
 be an exit for the FDR around here  somewhere. Oh, no,  I'm in the hundreds. Oh, no.  Oh, my  God, that's 138th Street.  How'd I get up here?  Hey, this don't look like Midtown anymore.  Where are the people in the business suits?  But listen,  the straight  Oh, the paranoia that  goes through your head. I'm just being honest with you,  Angie. I really don't know why  because you could go from east to west  on one hundred and twenty fifth street. It's all 
[181:30]
 stores. You got Starbucks,  Pathmark and all that stuff.  And it's nice. So I don't know why you should  be terrified. I don't see the stores  because the hour I drive past  that all those big grates are down in  front of the windows and  stuff, you know, because they pull down the big locked  grates. Yeah. So I don't know.  I swear I was driving through that Friday.  It looked like a scene out of my video  game Kingpin that I was playing.  Like it just looked frightening.  You guys exaggerate.  Angie, but we're just being honest. I swear that there's not 
[182:00]
 much. There's not much of a bit here.  This is what we do.  The funniest line is Anthony going, Oh my  that's a hundred and twenty  Oh, now I'm up in the hundreds.  What happened?  Where's the bridge for God's sake?  I got across the bridge to  safety. Well, I need  safety. Next time if you  come up here, I'll escort you through  and walk through and nobody will bother you.  I would like to try that. But I  I'm telling you, I'm paranoid. I mean  there's white people that live up here. 
[182:30]
 What's that? There's white people that live up here.  Oh, no, there's not. Yes, there is.  You stop spreading that word.  Oh, come on. For real. You know that.  Yeah, they're called pimps.  Wow.  Wow. You're crossing  the line. Isn't that terrible?  That was just a joke.  You know something? I don't  know much about Harlem because anytime I've been up there,  it's been at night when I'm  driving to get to a  bridge and I don't  really stop and look around. 
[183:00]
 Believe me, and I don't make any eye contact.  And I leave about  five car lengths in front of me  just in case I got to make one of them quick getaways.  Just in case someone,  you know, get out the core.  You know?  Get out the core!  Well, there's a difference though because  I don't know. It's bad.  My mind is bad.  And I still got my stupid mask plates on.  So it's just like, oh, brother, here it is.  Hey, I'm a mark. Hi.  Hi, brother. 
[183:30]
 Yeah, no, I'm just down from Worcester,  Massachusetts. I need directions to the  what's that?  Is that a firearm?  Listen, we're so uncivilized.  Hey, look, I'm raising the roof. I'm like you,  homie.  Can't we all just get a little, put the knife away.  Could you put, please put them away.  Oh, man.  It's all stereotype.  I know, like yesterday,  it was the Polish people today.  It's equal opportunity.  Well, let's look. We did 
[184:00]
 rag the Mexicans earlier in the hour.  Oh, that's right, with the peppers and the mayonnaise.  And the Hasidic Jews. There were a couple of jokes that came in  for those folks today.  Okay.  Okay, because I was wondering when we were going to get our chat.  Take us up to Harlem one day and give us the tour.  I want to see the Apollo Theater.  I want to see,  did I say the Apollo Theater?  What else is up there?  If you can take us for like a drive in your  neighborhood, would you mind if we did it in an  armored tank?  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now on 
[184:30]
 Malcolm X Bullhorn. If you look to the right,  you'll see, oh,  look at that.  Gentlemen, if you reach out your seat to find  your kevlar, put on  your vest and your helmet  to assist your safety.  As we drive down Malcolm X Boulevard,  you may hear a whizzing next to your  ears, which you might think is a mosquito  or a fly. These are actually small  arms fire that are going right  past your head.  Do the tour buses  really go up there? No, yes, they really 
[185:00]
 do, every day. Okay.  And of course, we'll be  disembarking from the bus to  go on the attraction ride here  at the roller coaster we call Crack Hall  and we'll be leaving the bus  and going into an authentic  70s style  pimp mobile.  Pink Cadillac, you'll all get a  complimentary hat with a big  rooster feather on it.  Thank you for taking  the Harland tour lines,  where our motto is, 
[185:30]
 it's Ike.  You know what I'm saying?  Mike, what's  going on?  How you doing? All right.  I just wanted to tell you guys, like, I'm a cop  and I go home at night at midnight  and I'm scared. I got a gun on me. I blow  the lights too. He has a gun  and he blows the red lights. You blow all the lights? Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cops  gotta be pretty cool with that. Like if you see  some guy blowing lights  in a bad neighborhood and you pull him over  or something, it's gotta be like, hey, you know, officer 
[186:00]
 come on, look around. Yeah.  Yeah, help me out a little. He's a guy with a flak.  You know where he's coming from. Come on. All right, Mike.  Thank you. Well, it's, you know,  it is a small percentage  of people, but I think  the image that some of these  towns have. Yeah. Well,  scary. Let's hear from Starks.  Starks. Yo, what's up? You're from Harland?  No doubt. Yeah.  Listen, y'all telling me over here, man.  I understand. What's the matter, Starks? We're just being  honest, though. We get a little  nervous when we drive through Harland. What do you want 
[186:30]
 from us? Yo, I work in the  projects, man. Nothing but  nice people in Harland. Yeah.  Nothing but nice people, man. Well,  help us out. We'll listen to your  side of it. Has it changed?  I don't know. I just, I just.  You gotta try to drive through Harland, all right?  It's like a different scene  now. It's not like back in the day you hear stories.  Yeah. Maybe that was true.  I don't know, but right now. Maybe it's changed like  Times Square's changed, you know. There's no more  spotting. Everything is like Disney. Maybe Harland's like  Disney. Do you have a Disney store in the middle of 
[187:00]
 Harland? Disney. Not really.  We got Magic Johnson open of everything over there.  Magic Johnson with his movie theaters, right?  Yeah. Off Marker.  I hear they have bulletproof screens  at the movie theaters.  Yeah, you killin' me. Plus a few cats  into the movie. Hey, Starks,  how far you have to go to  get to a Popeye's Fried Chicken?  There's one up there somewhere. Yeah, there is.  Yeah. Well, what? Popeye's  Kentucky, because you want. Well, Starks, what can you tell  Whitey about Harland? That we don't  know. That we don't know. Listen, y'all got more 
[187:30]
 respect than a regular brother up there.  Yeah. Trust me, they ain't trying to make the neighborhood  a, gotta get a bad,  a bad rap,  you know? Yeah.  Check it out. I work with white boys all the  time in Harland. They cool. They great.  So we should just come up, visit and stuff?  Why not? Check it out. Bring plenty of cash.  You think we could do a live broadcast from the middle  of Harland? Yeah, that would be fun.  Starbucks. Starks, Starks,  you guys will walk by laughing at us.  Look at the white boys in Starbucks. Yeah, right.  White boys, well, 
[188:00]
 I don't know why they put a Starbucks in Harland.  Well, we have to be  educated, you know? We're  ignorant. We are ignorant. We gotta get up  there and then take a look around, because I'm just  going off of what I heard and what I see when  I'm driving through very late at night. It's very scary.  Right. Yeah, what's the deal with that cop talking about  he's scared? Yes. He can't get the hell out of  Harland then. He says he's scared when he drives  home. He has a gun. He goes for the red lights  too. Yeah, he's full of s***.  It's only  going 150 if it gets him head. 
[188:30]
 Starks, you got some chops to you, man.  We want to hang with you. You call  back anytime. No problem, dude.  You're funny though, man.  You guys suck.  Thanks, Starks. Bye.  Starks trying to give us the other side  of the day. We obviously, Opie,  we don't know anything about Harland.  We don't spend time up there. How can we  make any kind of a set? That's what we're pretty much  proven here. Rosa, very pissed off at us.  Rosa.  Yo. Hey, what's up? 
[189:00]
 I mean, I'm black. I'm from Harland. What's the deal?  And you're listening to our show?  Yeah. Man, I think that's awesome.  Somebody got to listen to it.  So help us out. We don't understand Harland is  what we're pretty much saying here today.  Why is it that you don't understand Harland? The people up there  just say, get us out.  We're naive white boys. We don't know  about up there.  Why is it that you don't know? What are you wondering?  I don't know. We get the image like a lot of people have  that it's very scary and if you go up there  something bad will happen to you. 
[189:30]
 Well, I was born and raised up there and there's nothing  going on up there. People are trying to survive.  What do you think?  You're black.  And you're white. And your point?  So if we go up there, it's like are we going to be looked at  as victims?  How about if I look at you like a victim?  Are you walking up there with guns and stuff?  No, I don't know. If I'm walking around  I'm going to find the FDR. That's all.  You don't know where the FDR is?  No, honestly, I'm in the hundreds and I'm getting really scared  and I don't see a big  sign for the FDR. 
[190:00]
 I can't see why you all have a problem.  I know people who are white and live in Harland.  Well, you're shining some light on the situation today.  We've got to go up there.  You've just got to be open minded and stop  listening to the same old crap all the time.  Alright, guys. Y'all be cool.  We're going to try to understand it. That's all. That's why we brought it up on the show today.  We've got to get up there, man.  We're going to do a broadcast from up there.  We'll do that.  Alright, Rosa. Bye.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, man. What's happening?  I can tell you guys, I've been up here 14 years. 
[190:30]
 They love the white boys.  The girls down there,  they know one thing, benefits.  They love you  for that. And the brothers down there,  they stay clear. They don't know if you're 5-0 or not.  You can walk the streets, bro.  In and out of the buildings.  They don't do a thing to you.  You don't know. In stocks, man, stocks,  you're cool, bro, but you're lying.  Ain't nobody working in the projects.  Alright?  They use the same garbage in the back of the truck  and ride around and around and around. 
[191:00]
 Oh, man.  See, this is the kind of  stuff we hear.  So we don't know what the real deal is.  I have no problem  going up there. I'll go up there.  We'll work something out.  We're going to bring a DAT recorder  and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  That's it, man.  If you like the Blair Witch Project,  you'll find the tape years later.  Nobody's going to catch me.  What was that?  Oh, my God. 
[191:30]
 Oh, my God.  Alright, man.  Josh!  Josh!  Oh, my God.  Wow, that's funny, man.  It's a pile of crackpipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  What's that sound? 
[192:00]
 Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Josh!  Oh, man.  What a mess. 
[192:30]
 I like that. 
[193:00]
 You don't want me anymore.  You're fat and ugly and stuff like that.  But radio was really good because nobody could see me.  You tell dirty jokes?  Well, they're off color.  I don't like to tell them.  But I have multiple choices of what you want me to do.  Listen, you live 84 years.  And you collect a lot of crap.  You probably heard it too. 
[193:30]
 And you have nowhere to talk about it.  And I'm very thankful  that you guys called me and are giving me a chance to talk.  You're a 23 skidoo.  This is kind of like an audition for the Opium Anthony show.  So I think we need some of your best material.  So I would go right for the penis jokes.  Well, does your penis burn when you urinate?  In the morning, some guy asked his friend.  And his friend said, I don't know.  I never tried to light it.  Wow.  See, you know, I'm writing a dictionary.  And I'm interested in definitions.  Do you know what the definition of colitis is? 
[194:00]
 Colitis?  No, no idea.  Colitis is when a guy walks  and his balls collide.  You like that?  Yeah.  I don't know if the censors want me to continue.  I wanted to ask you,  how do you make a fruit cordial?  How do you make a fruit cordial?  Be nice to him.  That's one of those gay jokes.  Yeah, how do you like this song?  Tarara boom dee ay.  Did you get yours today? 
[194:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  Did you get yours today?  I got mine yesterday.  That's why I walk this way.  Boy, you must have really been a goer in your day, huh?  I would like to know if anybody would like to join my intercourse club.  No initiation, no fees, no dues.  Just come.  Obvious.  Did you hear the one about the Russian lady who gave birth to a wooden baby? 
[195:00]
 No.  She married a pole.  Alright, Fran, listen.  She's pretty funny, man.  You're killing them out there.  You know what?  In the morning, what you may think is love is really a full bladder.  Do you have any other dirty jokes?  Well, not all dirty.  I want to tell you about Clem and Mildred sitting on a porch in the Midwest. 
[195:30]
 And Mildred says, Clem, ain't the moon pretty tonight?  And he says, yup.  She says, Clem, do you love me?  And he says, yup.  And she says, Clem, say something soft and mushy, Clem.  He says, bullsh**.  Hold on, Fran!  You can't use the S word.  You can't use the BS word.  No, no.  I'm telling you, I've known an 84-year-old lady that she can't say the BS word on herself. 
[196:00]
 Now, Fran, when was the last time you had sex?  I haven't had it for 25 years and I'm very happy and healthy.  And I want to talk about that.  Would you like one?  Love is a long and slender thing.  Love is a long and slender thing.  You made me love you.  You woke me up to do it.  Alright, Fran, 84-year-old lady telling dirty jokes.  You want to play your little piano for a minute there?  Yeah. 
[196:30]
 Alright.  Any words?  You sure this isn't a tape from 1920?  Yeah.  So like, hey, Spank, let's go to the fishing home.  Okay, Alpha.  She's playing the piano.  This is radio.  She's just playing the piano.  She's just playing the piano.  She's just playing the piano.  She's just playing the piano.  Okay.  My dog sure like them Keen Puffs.  Okay. 
[197:00]
 Wow, look at that, Fran.  I play by ear.  I play a thousand songs and sing them.  You sure can tickle the old ivories, as they say.  Hey, can you shoot eggs out of your private area?  Oh my God, I hope he stops it.  What?  What happened?  You know, I thought you were clean, pure, nice boys.  Yeah, we are.  You know, I thought you were clean, pure, nice boys.  Yeah, we are.  Have you ever seen that trick, though?  No, I never saw the egg trick.  We're going to have to invite you down. 
[197:30]
 Hold on, someone wants to talk to you here.  Oh, good.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, man, this lady's a riot, man.  You've got a lover, huh?  Playing the goddamn piano.  All right, well, you want to say hi to Fran, Scott?  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  Oh, we've got a love connection.  Hey, Fran, you think we could set you up with a banging?  Oh, fuck you.  You're ruthless, man.  Listen, if they like me, tell me what time you want me to be on  for about five minutes. 
[198:00]
 If anybody wants me, I'd be very happy to continue this.  And I can read some books and read poetry.  And, you know, if you want poetry or whatever.  I'm very happy to be on WNW.  Make a set up for me in the studio.  Scott, hang up, all right?  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Oh, I love everybody.  Thank you for the jackhammer.  Why?  Hey, Fran, have you ever had the jackhammer?  No.  No.  I'm sorry. 
[198:30]
 Where do you boys come from?  The sewer.  Hey, does he have another dirty joke in you?  I love commercials.  Dive in your pleasure, dive in your fun.  Sleep with two women instead of just one.  Still wonder where her fellow went  when she tells him she is pregnant.  I don't know how much more dirty you want it,  but I can't.  All right, hold on. There's a guy that wants to go out with you.  Bob, you have something to say to Fran?  You don't bang the old coops for the trip to Hawaii. 
[199:00]
 Oh, my God.  Hello.  Fran, what do you say?  I don't want the trip to Hawaii.  I was already there and it's very dull.  You let me bang you and I'll win the trips to Hawaii.  No, I don't really need that.  Come on, I'm 30 years old. You might like it.  I have mental stimulation  and I have a boyfriend that's 13 years younger than I.  You've got to pry one.  What?  You've got to pry one.  I don't need... Listen, I know...  You haven't had it in 25 years, Fran. 
[199:30]
 You've probably been a little back down.  I know you weren't made with a finger.  I've got a few fingers for you.  No, I would...  Bob, you're disgusting, man.  Come on, Fran, a little bit of you and me?  You mean people...  Your audience are so young that they still want to know  all about sex and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  I can't get wisdom from an old lady like me  that you're sure to be ashamed of yourself.  Hey, Fran, I don't want the wisdom.  I just want the booty so I can get the trip.  What are you going to do? 
[200:00]
 I would win the trip if Bob banged  an 84-year-old friend.  I don't think anyone would beat Bob.  Come on, Fran, you'll be doing me a favor.  I've never been to Hawaii.  She's so broad, couldn't get wet in the rainforest, okay?  What you going to do, Bob?  She's got a bitch.  You're going to have to dip her in Saudi Arabia  to get her looped up enough.  Oh, Fran's singing again.  Bob, what a mess this is.  Hey, Fran, how many people are on this wire?  All right.  Wire? 
[200:30]
 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  All right, Fran, you're still on the line with Bob  who wants to bang you.  Come on, Fran, let's do it.  All right, let's go.  Seriously, let's do it.  I'll get the trip, you get banged, everyone's happy.  I weigh 225 pounds.  I weigh 210, so I'm on top.  Oh, wow.  What do you look like?  I look a little bit like the guy in the middle.  I look a little bit like the guy in the middle.  I look a little bit like the guy in the middle.  I look a little bit like the guy in the middle. 
[201:00]
 I got a shower after this show today, man.  I got a shower after this show today, man.  Hey, you want to leave us with one last dirty joke?  How you make Manischewitz wine.  Yeah, how do you make that?  You kick him in the balls.  How bad...  That's so wrong, man.  How bad...  That's so wrong, man.  You got one more on there.  How about the guy...  Do you know about the guy...  Do you know about the guy...  Do you know about the guy... 
[201:30]
 Hello?  Do you know about the guy who married a shoplifter?  No.  He liked to watch us snatch.  Oh my lord.  Oh, Bill, what's going on?  You know, what kind of man? A modeling?  You got to go jacky now.  What? You want another one? 
[202:00]
 Sure.  The guy says, is that Dick Brown?  No, he was out in the sun too long.  She's out of control, man.  You got to have her in.  You got to give her a little corner in the back of the studio.  Bill, thank you.  Bye-bye.  What's the verdict?  We love you.  We absolutely love you.  We're going to get a limo for you to bring you down to the show in the very near future.  Rick, what's going on? 
[202:30]
 Hey, yo, what's up?  I'll f*** the old lady for the trip.  Right in the studio.  No joke.  Alright, listen, they're dumping out of our show like crazy.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  That's what I'm saying.  You're getting a fucking joke.  You're getting a rim shot.  Get a rim shot, will you?  Oh my God. 
[203:00]
 Oh my God.  What the hell?  We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.  I'm Tom Brokaw in the City Nightly News.  We continue coverage now of the search for Bernie Getz Squirrel. 
[203:30]
 Obviously a very distraught Bernie Getz Squirrel has been missing since early Friday morning.  The search continuing as the Navy Ship the Graph looks at the waters for Bernie Squirrel.  We're not sure if this was a flying squirrel, but they are looking for wreckage.  We'll speak later with a very distraught Bullwinkle who will give some insight on the life and times of Bernie Getz Squirrel. 
[204:00]
 Of course, a squirrel coming from a family plagued by tragedy over the years.  You may remember this squirrel's father shot in the head in the park by a little kid with a BB gun.  That horrible, horrible episode caught on videotape where you see his head go back into the left.  And the mommy squirrel covered with brains bravely goes on. 
[204:30]
 Here you're seeing footage now of Bernie Squirrel very young saluting that older squirrel.  The search now continuing.  Our helicopter is circling about looking for Bernie Squirrel.  The family of course consoling themselves that the squirrel compound, we cannot find the squirrel.  And boy, the teeth look a lot like the Kennedy family.  They don't have those big, big chompers they have. 
[205:00]
 Of course, Bill Clinton saying they're giving all resources to find the squirrel a treasure to bring out.  Tom, you sound a little woozy once again.  I was out looking for the squirrel myself and another squirrel was in a tree and threw a big, big nut down on my head.  It hit just right on my temple.  Tom Broga, I'm going to see that later. 
[205:30]
 Of course, tragic loss.  Everybody leaving flowers and nuts at the Geths house as a tribute.  As time runs out, I have the Coast Guard on the phone and they are saying this is now a search for victims and no longer a rescue.  I just want to let you know that the search costing millions of dollars now, the squirrel did not file a height plan. 
[206:00]
 We have talked with other squirrels and so they would not have even climbed a tree in the haze of Friday morning.  Very difficult.  Bernie Squirrel missing now for quite a few days as hope runs out at the squirrel compound.  You see the patriarch of the squirrel family, that big fat one.  I remember he made the news years back as he came crawling out of a river after a female squirrel that was accompanying him drowned under mysterious hookah hat hats. 
[206:30]
 But the search continuing, we will keep breaking into your programming, the search for a Bernie guest's squirrel.  Merle Jr. on this NBC Nightly News.  Still broadcasting from Yellowstone National Park, of course.  Looking for the picnic basket scandal that has plagued Yogi Bear as Ranger Smith is always trying to turn him around for a picnic. 
[207:00]
 Tom Broga, NBC Nightly News.  Scooby Doo McGilligurray and Ricochet Rabbit have gathered together and holding a candlelight vigil.  We will keep you updated on events looking for Bernie guest's squirrel. 
[207:30]
 Like I said, the Coast Guard is searching for victims now, no longer a rescue.  And we will cover the funeral of Bernie guest's squirrel who will be buried at sea after being cremated.  This just in, Tom Broga, NBC Nightly News.  The body of Bernie guest's squirrel has been found.  Tragic day.  We'll be going to the squirrel compound getting a reaction from the squirrel family. 
[208:00]
 The program, NBC Nightly News, will be tying up traffic and interrupting your favorite programs to bring you continuous coverage of a lost and now dead rodent.  You deserve the best, but that would be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  We're talking about steel reserve high-gravity lager. 
[208:30]
 Well, there's a problem in the community, as Reverend Al so eloquently puts it, that this steel reserve high-gravity lager, the ads are racist.  They show two tortoise having sex.  And that's racist.  And it says research shows sex sells.  Well, I guess it's racist putting such distasteful ads in only certain neighborhoods because they were saying you don't see these ads on Park Avenue. 
[209:00]
 It's all about supply and demand.  Yeah.  And I guess there's a demand for this stuff in the community.  All right. So this is the beer everyone's talking about, the high-gravity steel reserve.  Can I have one of those?  You know what's funny? Remember when I said earlier in the show?  I said, is Budweiser available in some of the communities that only handle steel reserve like Harlem?  And somebody said, yeah, but it's an import.  So available is an import.  All right. Here we go. Let me crack open. Wait. 
[209:30]
 Oh, with a fine twist off top.  8.1 proof. Whoa.  No, it's got 8.1% alcohol.  OK.  Wow. 12 ounces. Nice and cold.  Wait a minute. First of all, this color is a little off.  Doesn't it look like urine specimen?  Oh, wait a minute. I seem to have given you the wrong job.  I've been watching some In Living Color.  All right. High-gravity steel reserve. 
[210:00]
 Let's take a swig.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  Whoa!  Goddamn!  Where Goddamn?  Now that's good stuff.  All of a sudden you start talking black when you drink this.  No, wait a minute.  Hey, this stuff is potent.  Holy smoke!  What the?  It's strong. This is strong.  Yeah, it's strong.  It's stronger when it's warm.  Oh, I bet. 
[210:30]
 I don't like it.  Damn. Do you like it?  It's not awful bad like Meisterbrow or something.  This is like the other side of the spectrum.  I don't know.  I drink this in the cold on a street corner or something.  Maybe that's why it's got more alcohol in it.  No, I'm serious.  Maybe after you've already had sex with her.  If I was at home and I was enjoying an after-dinner brew,  this wouldn't be the one I'd go for.  I am outraged!  Oh, no. 
[211:00]
 I am outraged!  Reverend Allen.  I am outraged!  What the hell are you doing in the studio?  I see you drinking the steel reserve high-gravity lock.  Well, we want to try it.  There's a lot of controversy about this stuff.  This is a plot, a conspiracy by the white man.  Why is that?  8.1% alcohol.  Well, obviously, they want the homeless to drink this.  So when they die on the streets, they're already in bombs. 
[211:30]
 You got an extra bottle.  Hey, this stuff's pretty good.  You can have mine.  All right.  Wow, steel reserve.  That's just not happening for me at all.  Hey, leave the music on.  It's kind of a soundtrack.  I like it.  All right, but Doug has brought us something else here, too, to try out.  Oh, yeah.  Steel reserve.  Boy, I drank two sips and I'm tanked.  It went right to my head, but...  All right, what else did you bring?  He brought a blackened hand beer called Howling Monkey. 
[212:00]
 Oh, come on, look at the label.  Where's my...  Where?  All right, here's my Howling Monkey.  Dude, look at the label.  Let me see the label.  It's a monkey in a suit.  It is.  It's planted in the gate.  My God.  The label is adorned with the image of Dr. Zayas.  Damn you.  Damn.  Let me partake in some of this Howling Monkey.  Damn, it's not bad. 
[212:30]
 My God, the image of Dr. Zayas staring back at me.  Damn you all to hell.  I can't be drinking Howling Monkey, but I'm strangely drawn to it.  Drawn to the Howling Monkey as I was drawn to Zeri, lovely Zera.  Cornelius never knows.  He will never know what happened between me and Zera. 
[213:00]
 We drank a case of Howling Monkey and then I turned her into a Howling Monkey.  Yes, I dropped my loincloth.  She saw the man with no hair on his body.  I gave her some of Charten's meat.  I partook in monkey meat while drinking Howling Monkey.  Damn me to hell.  I like the Howling Monkey. 
[213:30]
 Well, is it better than the Steel Reserve?  What's the alcohol content on me?  Shut this music, give me Reverend Al's and I'll go back to the Steel Reserve.  Alright.  I feel a little more Steel Reserve.  Wait a minute.  Give that to me.  Alright.  Alright, here's Steel Reserve.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Steel Reserve definitely stronger.  Got a stronger taste to it. 
[214:00]
 Wow, that's gross.  That's a Howling Monkey you don't like it?  No, that's a better one.  Now, is this sold in the black community still?  Is this in the community?  This was around here.  We could get this around here.  Oh, it is?  Damn.  I don't know.  Well, the Steel Reserve will get you snotted.  I'll give you that.
