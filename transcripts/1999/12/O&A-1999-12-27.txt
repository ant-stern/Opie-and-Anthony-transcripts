 I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh, don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No! It's our show!  I'm a mad man!  I'm getting pissed!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person.  No! I'm getting pissed!  No! No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  Oh, B and Anthony.  How can you tell who's insane and who's insane?  Oh, you, Ramparty. 
[00:30]
 You guys sometimes like piss me off, okay?  Wuddaloo, wuddaloo, wuddaloo!  1027.  Oh, there are rumors running rampant about Ronald Reagan's health.  Yeah, I saw that in the paper today.  They're saying some rumors have him on a 36-hour death watch.  Oof, like he's going to drop any second now, and the family's like,  Hey, shut up!  Well, his son is really pissed. Michael. Michael Reagan.  He's quoted in the paper today.  I just saw him the other day, and he's fine. 
[01:00]
 Quit scaring the family. My kids have to deal with it.  People come up to them, and they ask me if something's wrong with Grandpa.  There's a lot wrong with Grandpa at this point.  Yeah, man.  So, Reagan's doing okay, and tonight, I believe, our buddy Tom Brokaw  will be talking to Nancy Reagan.  Oh, really?  About the ex-president's health and Alzheimer's  and dispelling all the rumors that have been flying lately.  Tom Brokaw, I'm going to say nightly news. 
[01:30]
 Opie and Anthony, thank you for giving me this opportunity  to plug my injury with Nancy Reagan at the end.  Tom?  Yeah?  You sound extra woozy today.  Oof.  You sound really odd.  A little groggy today.  Yeah.  I was working on my car, you see, in the garage.  Yeah.  The door was shut, and the exhaust fumes was overcome by carbon monoxide. 
[02:00]
 So, a little groggy.  Thank God, Mrs. Brokaw holds me out of the garage just in the nick of time.  But I wouldn't have been able to perform an interview with Nancy Reagan.  Remember Nancy Reagan, first lady, her motto on drugs, just saying, oh.  What? What was that?  She said, just say no.  Oh, just say no, right.  Yeah. 
[02:30]
 Which is probably what Ronald Reagan is saying when she wants to off him up some of that  gas.  I'll have to remember to ask her that on tonight's Every Nightly News interview with,  who?  Nancy Reagan.  Tom Brokaw, Every Nightly News interview with Nancy Reagan.  Every Nightly News.  Very good.  Tom.  Tom Brokaw.  Let me see.  Achille Laurel.  Why are you pulling a clip?  Achille Laurel. 
[03:00]
 I must learn how to say Achille Laurel.  Achille Laurel.  All right, Tom, thank you.  Don't you have to go and work on the piece for tonight?  Yes, I have to work on the piece.  All right, Tom Brokaw, everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tom Brokaw, everyone.  There he goes.  Hey, Anthony, look at our luck.  Rick is informing me that the ex-president of the United States of America is on the hotline, 
[03:30]
 Anthony.  Really?  The same line that old dirty uses to call our show.  Isn't that a disgrace?  The ex-president is on the line, and he wants to dispel all these rumors about his health.  Oh, good.  So let's go to the phone right now and...  Aunt.  What?  Where are you going?  I'll be right back.  You talk to the president a while.  I'll be right back.  Wait, this is...  You start it. 
[04:00]
 I'll finish.  I got to take a leak.  Aunt, this doesn't happen every day.  You don't get the chance to talk to an ex-president.  Just start.  Just hold him on the line until I get back.  Ugh.  He just doesn't get it.  An ex-president on the line.  Hello?  Hello, O.P.O.  Oh, I mean, hello?  Yes.  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  Well, I wanted...  I wanted to dispel the rumors. 
[04:30]
 All right.  Do we have the president, the ex-president on the line now?  No.  Yes, I had to take the phone from, I believe that was Sam Donaldson.  Not sure.  Well, I just wanted to dispel those rumors about my health.  Yeah, they're saying that there's a 36-hour death watch.  On who?  On you, Mr. Reagan.  Is Mr. Reagan there? 
[05:00]
 No, no, you're Mr. Reagan?  I am.  Yeah, you're the ex-president of the United States of America.  Yes, and I want to say, I'm as spry as JFK Jr.  I wanted to dispel any...  Well, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.  No, no, no.  Hello?  No, you left the presidency a real long time ago, Mr. Reagan.  Where did I leave it?  I'm always forgetting things. 
[05:30]
 The bombing starts in five minutes.  No, no, no, no.  Hello?  We want to just discuss the fact that you're still alive and well.  God bless Pakistan.  Well, I'm fine.  I still take a dump every morning like clockwork at 6 a.m.  Well, I don't get up till 7.  That old guy.  That old guy.  You were spotted on the streets of California in Brentwood eating ice cream. 
[06:00]
 I was?  Yes.  Yes, I love ice cream now.  It's much the same as running the free world, eating ice cream.  Eating ice cream.  One minute you have your hand on the button and it could destroy all mankind.  The next you're eating Fudgy the Whale.  Can someone shoot me?  Hello?  Well, they already shot at you.  We shouldn't be making jokes about that.  They did when?  Way back in what, 80? 
[06:30]
 81?  Did I make it?  Yes, you did.  You made it through.  Fine.  Thank God for that.  Look, I'm a cat now.  Meow.  Meow.  Well, now every morning I wake up and thank God I'm able to stare at Nancy's giant head.  She's like a Bergen Pez dispenser.  It's like looking at a Mardi Gras float for God's sake.  Hello?  Hello?  Is that why you are? 
[07:00]
 Why are you counting?  I'm counting my liver spots.  Four or five more and I'm a black man.  Looking forward to that.  Look, I can see through walls and I'm a pirate.  A best matey.  You know what the good thing about Alzheimer's is?  I'm with a new chick every day. 
[07:30]
 Why is it always a skinny pig with a huge head?  Oh, that's so wrong.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that curtain rod.  I was leader of the free world now I don't even know when I take a dump.  Oh, wait, I think I just did.  Right on your mind.  It's off to Carvel for another Fudgy the Whale. 
[08:00]
 Well, obviously you're alive and well, Mr. Reagan.  God bless Iraq.  Hello?  Hello?  Okay, thank you.  There he goes.  The ex-president of the United States of America.  Or someone that sounds a lot like him.  Now, what the hell did Anthony...  Anthony?  What the hell happened?  Hey, put him on.  Hey.  Mr. President, it's an honor to speak with you.  I was always a big... 
[08:30]
 He hung up.  I told you to hold him on the line until I got here.  I was trying, as Alzheimer's, you know.  You always hang up before I get back.  It's like right before I get back.  He can't remember things.  I told him to hang in there.  You wanted to talk to him and, you know, I couldn't keep him on the line.  Damn it.  He missed a golden opportunity.  So many questions I wanted to ask.  Did he sound okay?  Oof.  Really?  Well, maybe next time.  I think Mr. Reagan had too many beers last night.  He was a little confused what voice he was doing today. 
[09:00]
 Really?  I'm going to have to hear that on a tape or something.  You might have to.  He thought he was still doing the Tom Brokaw.  He did?  Really?  Yes.  What an ass.  Maybe Mr. Reagan should get to bed before four in the morning.  Hey.  I wasn't in bed early.  No, I'm not talking about you.  Oh, okay.  I'm talking about the president.  The O.B. and Anthony show.  I have no clue what anybody is saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  1027.  O.B. and Anthony. 
[09:30]
 We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  All right, it's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the show.  Hey, it is Monday, a couple days after the big Christmas day. 
[10:00]
 Hopefully everybody did well, got some good gifts.  Remember, the guy's going to be off until next Monday, so we are doing the worst of all  this week, which is kind of cool.  We're going to dip back, grab some real old bits, grab some more recent stuff, stuff off  world CD, stuff that would have been on their new CD, but it's not coming out just yet.  So we are in the process of doing that.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony all this week.  Any suggestions for the show?  212-757-1027.  Spaz is working the phones. 
[10:30]
 You can fax them to us at 212-957-WNEW or just hope that you hear what you want to hear.  Got a lot of great suggestions from last week.  We'll try and get them on sometime today or maybe tomorrow.  Why don't we get right back to it, shall we?  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Here's some Stephen Lynch by requests. 
[11:00]
 When I was a boy of ten I had a very best friend. 
[11:30]
 It was kind with good intent but just a little different, all special and mama dropped him  on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special, just a little bit special. 
[12:00]
 We'd play tag and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I like math and spelling bee and liked talking to a trio special and mama dropped him on 
[12:30]
 his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed cause he's a little bit special.  A little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran head first into walls. 
[13:00]
 I had girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  He's so special and mama dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  He's a little bit special, just a little bit special. 
[13:30]
 One day talking to special Ed, he grabbed a brick and he swung it in my head.  As he laughed at me that's when I knew special Ed just made me special too.  Now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[14:00]
 I give strangers great big hugs next to me.  Ed is fine, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head you see.  Now we're not so right instead.  We're a little bit special, just a little bit special. 
[14:30]
 That bastard Ed made me special.  Just a little bit special.  Alright, there's the Stephen Lassie no in love.  There's some redemption.  Please forgive me.  Now more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. 
[15:00]
 And it's Opie and Anthony, phone number 212-757-1027.  Also receiving a lot of great faxes today, fax line 212-957-9639.  Of course a very disturbing clip on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Alright, let's get back to Rick's bachelor party.  We pretty much discussed the ride over there and we discussed how when I pulled out my  wad of money the girls attacked me like they were seagulls at the beach going for a crust 
[15:30]
 of bread.  That is the way to describe it man.  I pulled that out and Rick was late so Earl got all the lap dances.  Well Earl's the one I think, you seem to be the most uptight about the whole thing Earl.  No I wasn't.  Well let me be honest, you were.  When that one first girl wanted to take you to the VIP lounge in the back you resisted 
[16:00]
 at first.  You were sitting in the chair going, no, no, no, no, don't want to lap dance.  You silly rabbit.  I just thought that honor should have went to Rick.  Well he wasn't there.  It wasn't there.  It would have but he was not there and he wasn't showing up for another hour and a half  at that point so it was just like hey, give it to Earl.  I just thought it was funny, I was like okay who's going to be the first guy and everyone  just turned around and pointed their fingers straight at me.  Oh yeah.  Well you are the virgin. 
[16:30]
 Oh stop it.  You got it, you got to give it to Earl.  There's no bell being rung there.  Ring the bell.  That's not the reality.  I'm just in a dry spell that's all.  29 years.  You got tumbleweeds rolling around in your carotid.  Dry spell.  Well yeah Earl got I think a lap dance every three minutes for the whole evening. 
[17:00]
 Everybody was just, yeah because you're talking and stuff.  Sometimes a lap dance gets in the way.  I'd rather watch someone else get in the lap dance.  Put it this way, Nunzio completely hooked us up with funny money and stuff and that  was supposed to be for Rick but because Rick was late we used it on Earl.  By the time Rick the bachelor showed up we were running out of funds quickly.  The lap dance is just an odd thing.  There's no touching so you just kind of sit in the chair with your arms on the armrest 
[17:30]
 as this chick is going around you and gyrating in front of you and looking at you like you  should be pounding her.  But it's like I will just stay completely still in this chair as you circle me.  It's like when you used to play a stupid game with your siblings.  I'm not touching you.  Look I'm not touching you.  I'm not touching you.  I'm like you're right next to the person.  You put your hand right next to that face. 
[18:00]
 Why?  Why are you mad?  I'm not even touching you.  I'm not touching you.  That's how it is.  They get right next to you.  It's the adult version of that game.  My ass is not touching you.  My ass is not touching your nose.  Alright.  So then I guess.  The VIP room was great.  Yeah the VIP.  You don't talk about the VIP room.  Ixnay on the VIP room.  Just say it was great.  Sit down Danny.  How about a lap dance? 
[18:30]
 So we were treated like kings of gold fingers and then finally the night came to an end  for most of us.  Yeah I guess pretty much everyone left after a while.  I decided that there was no way in hell I could go home Anthony.  With the smells and the things that were hanging off my clothes it would be safe to stay away 
[19:00]
 from home.  You just end up smelling like dancer.  Like I said earlier there were substances on my body that I could not recognize and  I felt it was safe to stay away from the homestead because I wasn't functioning right where I  could explain some of this stuff.  So I decided to crash at Ben's place and my clothes by the way have officially been burned. 
[19:30]
 Oh really?  Yes.  Did your pants look like, well, did it look like you dropped some sour cream on there?  Not that bad.  Out of the fajita?  No not that bad.  But first of all I guess Mark, Psycho Mark who is in the studio, he is starting to get  really pissed at everyone.  No no no no no no no.  Don't go there.  Don't go there?  You are freaking loony with those dances man. 
[20:00]
 That was part of the best part of the show.  You know what guys can relate to this.  There is always one guy in the crew that is convinced that the girl actually likes him  and he will be going home to bang the dancer.  That person in our gang is?  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Hello.  But at one point I think had too many dollars in both hands. 
[20:30]
 Did I see a shoe off with more dollars between your toes?  You were shaking money around like Trump sitting front row.  You were like right there next to the stage and the girl would come over and give him  a lap dance and he is getting into, like his arms are going and he is almost dancing with  the girl.  Correct.  I was having a good time.  Well sure.  Isn't that right?  Is it true you were thinking you had a shot at that girl?  No of course not. 
[21:00]
 Now he says it.  What time did you get home?  Oh at 3.30.  Let me stress, let me make it perfectly clear.  We started the festivities around 8.15.  It wasn't like we went out at 11 because most guys are like what's the big deal?  Four hours in a club?  No big deal.  No we are talking eight hours in the club per month.  That's a hard day's work.  To the point where you are punching your pal Ben over there.  Ben deserved the punch but we will get to that in a little bit.  We can get to it now because it all relates.  Now Ben has an apartment in the village. 
[21:30]
 Right?  Low-reside.  Big.  Near NYU and all that.  And Ben has a really small place.  Correct, Mark?  You stayed there?  Yes I have.  When you first moved to the city.  Now I asked Ben if I could crash on his couch because there is no way, like I said earlier,  there is no way I could go home.  Right.  There was a slight problem with that.  Ben told me yeah no problem.  And that's the truth.  I thought everything was cool.  I found out when I arrived at Ben's place that there was already another guy staying  there, another one of his friends that is moving to New York City. 
[22:00]
 See, Ben has all his friends in and they all move to New York City but they start their  journey in New York by staying with Ben for a month.  Right?  Is that true?  Totally right.  Who is this guy?  It's Ed.  Drunk Ed.  Drunk German Ed.  With a bullet hole in his head.  Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  I guess this would be a great time to introduce Drunk German Ed to the show.  Who wants to tell the story of why he has a bullet mark in his head? 
[22:30]
 He was in the German army and I think they were doing exercises with the Russians and  he stuck his head up from behind a berm and got whacked with a 7.62 round in his head.  And the rumor is he was drunk when he was on duty and he went, what's on the other side?  He got shot with live ammo in the head during training.  Exercise.  It's a true story.  He's got a dent in his head.  That's why they call him Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head. 
[23:00]
 Pretty much wraps it up right there.  There you go.  True story.  So I go to Ben's assuming it's going to be no problem.  We'll get him to crash.  I got the couch.  Ben's got his bed.  Tiny little apartment.  No bigger than this studio we're in right now.  But there's Drunk Ed on Ben's couch.  With a 40.  With a 40 of Becks.  So Ben, what did you say to Ed?  I told him to go stay at Mark's. 
[23:30]
 And like a quarter to one he tells his guest, Ed, that he has got to leave his apartment  because I'm crashing there.  Now I'm feeling uncomfortable.  I'm like, Ben, didn't you work this out before you told me I could stay?  Hmm, guess not.  So Ed, all drunk and belligerent.  Gets up and goes to Mark's.  Yeah, but you missed the whole point.  Now there's a bunch of points here, Mark. 
[24:00]
 Now Mark didn't want Drunk Ed at his place because he was convinced that he was taking  one of the strippers from Goldfinger's house.  That is the truth.  No, it's not.  You're absolutely wrong.  That's not the reason why I wanted you.  You know your little honey's listening, but that is the truth.  I thought you were getting lucky.  Maybe I did.  You guys don't even know about it.  All right, so now Ben just flat out kicks his friend out on the street at 1230 at night 
[24:30]
 and all I remember is Drunk Ed going, you don't keep a black man out on the street at  1230 at night?  You've got to mention his head is also black.  A black German.  He's a black German with a bullet hole in his head.  So now where does the story go?  He went to Mark's building.  Oh, wait a minute.  Before he even gets to the building, you were at the club, right?  You're like, oh, oh, he's going to stay with me.  He's going to stay over at the place tonight. 
[25:00]
 So Ed's going to stay with you.  And I'm like, Ed is not staying at my apartment.  There is no way that Ed is staying with you.  I already told you that Ed cannot stay at my apartment.  Now logically it would have been like, logically it would have been okay if I would have just  like stayed at your place.  But you live with a gay guy.  I had a problem with that.  So I said, I'll go stay with Ben.  I guess.  And the gay roommate doesn't want drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head staying 
[25:30]
 at your house either.  Last time Ed came over, he almost broke all the furniture and he insulted my roommate.  What did he say?  He said something to the fact that I hate the Jews and my roommate is Jewish.  Isn't that amazing?  Even black Germans hate the Jews.  You think they would understand oppression and stuff.  But my poor roommate, being Jewish, got very offended.  And he was very upset.  And then Ed receives to blow a nasty, stinky beer party. 
[26:00]
 And you know how those gay guys eat their ramen so nice and neat and stuff and smell  good.  So needless to say, my roommate's mouth so Ed is no longer proud of my first thing.  So drunk Ed goes to Mars.  Problem is Mars is not home because let's go back to the story.  So try to pick up the script.  I was hanging out with Nonsiall. 
[26:30]
 Nonsiall is very cool.  So, so drunk Ed stayed in your lobby for how long?  Not kidding.  Three hours in the lobby of your building.  And he's waiting for Mark to get home.  Right.  So he can stay with her.  He can sleep.  Right.  So meanwhile he's sitting in the lobby of my building, bothering me before dormant.  Just like making erratic conversation with the poor guy.  And trying to explain his plight as a black German stuck out in the city.  With the bullet holes. 
[27:00]
 Right.  So I walk in.  This was like 3.30.  And all of a sudden I'm tired.  I'm ready to go to bed.  I look.  Hey Mark, it's Ed.  I'm like what the hell are you doing here?  Hey, hope he stays home with his bedside.  He didn't move me out to the street.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  He did roam out in the street.  Oh man.  Ben, flat out Ben.  Ben flat out said, you have to leave. 
[27:30]
 So Ed comes over to my place and says, I don't have a place.  I told Ed, you can't stay here.  You cannot stay here.  So I ended up loaning him like another $200.  Did he get a hotel room?  At 3 o'clock in the morning.  3.30.  If my roommate woke up and saw a black guy sleeping on the couch, would it be a place with a bullet hole in the back?  It would not be pretty tough. 
[28:00]
 The gay guy doesn't like the black German guy with the bullet hole in the back.  Likewise, the black German guy doesn't like the Jews, which the gay guy takes offense to.  Is he Jewish?  Yes.  Oh, OK.  Well, that one makes perfect sense.  Very Jewish.  And Ed's claiming that when Ben kicked him out of the apartment that we were mocking him and laughing at him.  Yeah.  Well, he told me he was.  Ben was laughing at you.  You threw me out of the apartment. 
[28:30]
 You parted the day.  So please, just go.  Oh, you threw me out of the street.  Mark, you could have helped me.  I'm scared to play.  He's still drunk out of his mouth, slurring his words.  So anyhow, I get him to leave.  And the doorman is like, who the hell is that guy?  He spent the last three hours trying to come up and converse with me about this bullet hole in his head and people throwing him out of the street.  But Ben, that was probably the coldest thing I've ever heard in a long time. 
[29:00]
 That was pretty cold to put your own friend out in the street.  I mean, you could have let him stay, you know, in a corner for Christ's sake.  You're right.  Now looking back on it, you're right.  Oh, now?  OK.  Oh, so funny.  I'm standing here.  I'm standing here.  That's how it went down.  Not nice.  And you're laughing too, Ope.  Yeah, Ope.  I think Ope's part of the problem too.  Like, you didn't say anything like, did you say anything to Ben like, oh, Ben, you can't do that, man. 
[29:30]
 Look, I'll make other arrangements.  Hey, look, Ben, I was tired.  Screwed the guy with the bullet hole in his head.  I'm tired.  I was tired.  One must know evil before he can condemn his gun.  Ope.  One must have seen evil before he can denounce it.  Anthony.  This is disgusting.  That's very, very cold.  No!  F.M. Hott.  Ope and Anthony.  Crap.  What?  Crap.  We can't put that on the air. 
[30:00]
 F.M. Hott at 1027.  All right, you know, the worst of Ope and Anthony, what is happening?  It's Rick, the producer of the show.  We've been all this week doing the worst of, so if you've got any suggestions whatsoever, stuff maybe from the first week that you remember, if you've been with the show that long, or from last week,  because we had a couple of good bits from last week as well, and anything in between during the entire tenure, the guys stand here, the WNEW, we are doing it. 
[30:30]
 It's the worst of Ope and Anthony.  Dial it up, 212-757-1027.  See what we can get on for you.  A request for OJ911, Jeter and Piazza with Mad Dog, Dreamweaver, a big request for Dreamweaver and some wherever now.  All that stuff is on the way, so make sure you listen.  Also some Louis Anderson next hour.  But let's get back to it, shall we, with the worst of Ope and Anthony.  Again, any suggestions?  212-757-1027. 
[31:00]
 Today, you're stuck with the worst of Ope and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  Hey, man.  It's O&A. What up, man?  Don Imus here, I just want to... I got a problem with that videotape.  You saw the video, Mr. Imus?  No, that was me in the video.  I had secrets out, I'm really an old broad. 
[31:30]
 Yeah, of course, we're talking about the video of the lady having sex.  She just had to be 100 years old, Imus.  See, without my big fag cowboy hat on, you can't tell I'm actually a woman.  Shut up, Bernard.  Did look like Imus, didn't it?  Imus with the wig, sure. I could see that, Anthony, a little bit.  Not even with a wig. See her? She didn't have much hair.  Anywhere.  I'm upset.  Everyone is just disturbed, we're trying to move on here. 
[32:00]
 Louis, what's up, man?  Yeah, I'm in Newark airport, man. Just passed a group of old people.  Just made me shiver just walking by them.  The old guy almost needed a walker just to get out.  Time blows.  I'm telling you...  I swear to God, man.  You had to see these old people, man. I'm like going, oh my God.  Just imagining one of them, not even just the group.  Making an orgy out of it? 
[32:30]
 Know what the funny thing is about this? There's an article in the paper about Hugh Hefner.  And there's a lot of people outraged because Hugh Hefner, at the age of 70, 71,  is taking Viagra and banging four broads that are in their early 20s.  Yeah, he says that just because he's gotten older, his taste in women hasn't gotten older.  He's still attracted to girls that are in their 20s.  And he's banging a girl that... he's banging twins that are 21 years old.  21 years old.  And he's got two more that he's doing.  Right.  And it's all because of Viagra and he loves it. 
[33:00]
 And most people will read about Hugh Hefner in the paper today and say he's a sick bastard.  Let me tell you what's sick. Sick is what we just saw in the other studio.  Yeah, because I got to tell you, I don't think there's probably much difference.  I'm not saying every 71, 75-year-old woman looks like the 100-year-old one in there,  but a majority of them do.  So what does Hugh have to have sex with a woman that looks like ET?  To be morally right in your eyes? What, are you kidding me? He's a single man. 
[33:30]
 God bless this guy.  God bless him, he's right.  Unbelievable. And he says it's all because of Viagra.  And he says he pops this stuff like it's M&M's pretty much.  He's probably got a big bowl of it in his hand.  He's like, hey, I'm just popping it in his mouth.  Like you would eat peanuts or something.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, oh no.  Like throwing them up in the air and catching them.  Jiggling around in his hand like you do with peanuts. 
[34:00]
 Tic tacs, yeah.  Look at my bathrobe.  Oh man.  Don, what's up?  Hey guys, how you doing?  All right.  Just want to tell you, nobody would touch you happy with a ten foot bowl if it wasn't for his millions of dollars.  You're right, good point.  I mean, give me a break. Viagra, no Viagra, I don't care.  That's my goal, to get very rich in the next 40 years.  That's it, then you can afford the girls, you go for the guns though.  Yeah, if I had the choice, I'm going to celebrate my 75th anniversary with my loved one. 
[34:30]
 Yeah.  Boy, you're kidding.  There's going to have to be an arrangement at that age.  Hope he's going to have a vending machine with Viagra and a just drop it in a gumball machine.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, they must love that at the retirement home.  So, you know, the Viagra thing, before Viagra, what did they have to worry about?  Changing diapers, the guy's drooling, hey, hey, over in the corner, the old lady occasionally dying, they wheel around and stuff.  But I mean, now Viagra, you've got these horny old guys rolling around the halls. 
[35:00]
 Well, think about it, I don't think they allow it, right?  Because it's got to be by prescription.  They probably got to smuggle it in.  They're smuggling it in.  They got to smuggle it in, it's like the joint.  Hey, you got any? I'm hurting real bad. I need some. I ain't had wood in a week.  Screw the wood, he hasn't leaked in a week, he needs just the leaps.  But then they're not looking, you know, they're like half. They're looking for the younger broads.  And what are they going to look for in the retirement home? 
[35:30]
 Unison 2B needs a bandana.  Hey, sweetie, Dustin.  Yeah.  What's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to find out if this old lady ever appeared on Willard Scott's 100 Years Smucker Jar.  The Smucker Jar?  Yeah.  That wasn't the Smucker Jar.  Yeah.  So, you know, by the day, so.  She was too very happy birthday to Loretta.  100 years young, whoa, look at her go. 
[36:00]
 Loretta's hobbies include hobbing, the knobbing,  now the sounds of brittle bones breaking under the weight of doggy style.  There are just some things older people probably shouldn't do.  I don't know. Loretta still gets up every day to do some gardening and the horizontal bar.  She likes knitting, cooking for her family and all. 
[36:30]
 And gumming her neighbor.  Time is a bitch though, man.  I remember working in a retirement home one day.  We were doing a job in there.  There was some old guy in a wheelchair just yelling.  He's sitting there and he's just, hey, hey, hey, yelling.  And like I'm horrified and no one's doing anything for the poor guy.  And I said to the woman at the counter, I go, this guy's yelling back there. 
[37:00]
 He's just, hey.  And she goes, oh no, that's Mr. Johnson.  He does that all the time. He does that all day long.  He used to be a gym teacher.  I go, that explains it. I don't know who he put our gym teacher through.  But then I'm just thinking, picture the guy, you know, probably gym teacher,  got to be in some kind of shape.  He's got his little whistling stuff.  Years ago.  All right guys, come on, back on the track, another lap. 
[37:30]
 All right, we're going to climb her up today.  Football practice, yeah, yeah, come on. Hit it, hit it, go, go, go.  And then you just add a little time. Add a little time. What do you got?  Hey, hey, hey.  It just gives you a little perspective on things, you know.  Go for the gusto.  Live your life for God's sake.  Because someday you'll be there, hey.  Or like Loretta, with people looking at you horrified at your time ravaged body. 
[38:00]
 It looked like every organ she had settled on top of her pelvis.  Like she, it looks like, all I could say is, take Kate Moss, have her swallow a hippity hop.  And then leave her in a steam room for three years.  So the skin just kind of, I cannot explain this enough.  But it puts a little perspective on things.  I guess you just got to go for the gusto.  While you're young, like you Hefner.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[38:30]
 Sometimes you feel like a mess.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony, 1027.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We'll get back to more bits and stuff in just a little bit.  In the meantime, a quick music break with some James Addiction.  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[39:00]
 On FM Talk at 1027.  Come on.  Swing your partner, start to dance.  Grab him and pull down his pants.  Do-si-do-not quarter turn.  Tuck his one-eyed wonderworm.  Hop and stop across the floor.  Show him what you've got in store.  Grab those ankles, what a sight. 
[39:30]
 Drive it home with all your might.  Now your partner's pretty big.  Drill him like an oil rig.  Promenade and grab a beer.  Open it in your partner's rear. 
[40:00]
 Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.  We're talking about Louis Anderson.  We've stated in the past that I don't get it.  He's not funny.  Don't you have to be funny to have him labeled a comedian?  Yeah, I guess so.  But I don't know, I guess his stuff is so tragic that it becomes funny or something. 
[40:30]
 People laugh a lot of times because they're uncomfortable.  Sometimes comics get on stage and they either have an affliction or something.  Remember the deaf comedian girl?  And people are laughing but you can't understand a word she's saying,  but everyone's laughing because you're nervous and it's like,  you better laugh.  My arm went up on my ear though, I come up and no one's watching.  What did she say? I don't know, just laugh.  Smile, clap and laugh.  We interviewed her in LA a few years back. 
[41:00]
 Remember that?  I'm waving lips.  A publicist comes up to us and she goes,  you want to talk to, I forgot her name, the deaf comedian?  And we're like, this is radio.  She reads lips real well.  So as a gag, because we're just complete a-holes,  I start asking questions with my head turned.  And I'm a pretty good Van Trilla Quest watch, so I wasn't even doing it.  I was like, so how are you doing?  Anthony wouldn't move his lips and I heard my head.  So what's it like to be an astounder comic? 
[41:30]
 When you go out and make weapons?  That was pretty heinous.  Yeah, we understand.  That was the second silliest moment that we had in the past.  Remember we had to talk to, who's the guy with peanut, the damn puppet?  What's the name of that guy?  God, I can't remember his name.  The comedian with the puppet.  Jeff Dunham, I think.  Oh yeah, Jeff Dunham.  He does TV commercials now and stuff. 
[42:00]
 Now his whole act is peanut, the puppet.  What, he's an old guy or something?  Right.  Okay.  So we were doing interviews from the Montreal Comedy Festival  through an ISDN line.  So we weren't there.  No, we weren't there.  So Jeff Dunham was in Montreal with his puppet, Peanut.  And so we're like, okay, everyone, we got Jeff Dunham on the line  and he's talking to us and then he goes, hey, you want to say hi to Peanut?  And we're like, yeah, okay.  And Peanut starts talking.  And then Anthony and I realized how completely stupid this is. 
[42:30]
 And we go, Jeff, are you sitting there with the puppet in your hand right now?  He's like, yeah, well, I am.  And we just started laughing at him and then he just had to go away.  What do you need the puppet for?  It's a phone interview over the radio.  Yeah, but he was still doing the act even though it wasn't TV  where he had the actual puppet talking.  He needed the puppet.  It's like the movie Magic.  Magic with Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite movies. 
[43:00]
 All right.  Anyway, yeah.  So you laugh.  People laugh just because they're nervous.  Yeah.  You know?  He just talks about how fat he is and how tragic it is.  So people just start laughing.  All right.  So let's count all the fat jokes here.  You got your bell for the fat joke?  This is Louis Anderson and Rosie O'Donnell this morning.  This is just the comedic geniuses at work here.  Well, hi, Louis.  Hi, Rosie.  How are you?  I'm great.  So how's everything going?  Good.  Good.  I just got back from a trip around the world.  No kidding?  Yeah. 
[43:30]
 Not the world, no.  No.  Good.  Yeah.  What was that about?  The guy with the balloon.  You know why you don't fly a balloon?  One carry-on.  True.  Did you see him flying on a balloon?  That big, that big flying no grill on the ground.  If you did have a great hair, you'd be flying Burger King.  Have you ever been on a balloon?  No.  I was in one once.  Really?  It's scary.  Yeah, in Colorado.  Who weaves the basket out of there?  I had to be able to get reinforced.  You know, it's a lot of stress.  I had just a real crazy person so it's tight.  Right.  Where did you go?  You went just all over? 
[44:00]
 I was in Australia for a beautiful place.  Working or just living?  Just living.  Really?  They had the, what is that, the Formula One?  Do you know what that is?  The race car?  The race car, the little ones.  Every time I got in a cab, they said, hey, you're here for the race car?  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not. 
[44:30]
 I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  I said, no, I'm not.  That would be my thought too.  Do you have a favorite Tom Canona play?  I like those cream thingies.  That's the vanilla cream thing?  Oh honey, those are good.  Did you ever go in and they got just the one left?  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of, cream is good.  Somebody's pressed it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I always get it anyway.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, of course.  The last one, you know.  Right.  Now you've lost a lot of weight recently, haven't you?  Yeah, I've lost about 70 pounds.  Good for you, Willie.  Yeah, clap for that guy.  Clap for Fat Movers. 
[45:00]
 Just like me, it's a life thing.  It's a horrible thing.  What happens is about six o'clock at night, they lock me in a cage.  Because, you know, I just quit eating at night.  That was a big thing for me.  That was a thing.  Because we work at night.  Sure.  You work at night, you're doing stand-up, then you go and you're going to have your  meal.  Right.  It's 2 a.m., your stomach's full, you go to sleep.  Yeah, that's not good.  So what's your cutoff is now?  6 p.m.?  Yeah, about, yeah.  How do you do when you're working, like in Atlantic City this weekend?  You know, I just eat the fruit and stuff then.  I'm like, I'm going to go to sleep.  What's his name?  He's like, you get a drug, money, a doughnut.  I take the doughnut every time.  Same with me.  Yeah, it is true.  And you try to eat healthy.  I have that grilled chicken sandwich there with the fake grill marks.  Right?  Yeah.  I'm like, I'm going to go to sleep.  I'm like, I'm going to go to sleep.

 Weeping landscape, we leave you with the sounds of the Martian winds.  We don't normally leave you with the sounds of Mars, but since the lander's there, we have the microphones and the equipment, the sounds of the Martian winds. 
[186:00]
 Technology is a frightening, often fascinating thing when from millions of miles away you can actually hear the sounds of Mars.  So we leave you with the sounds of Mars. 
[186:30]
 That confirms it. I never want to grow up.  It's beyond moronic.  It's sub moronic.  OV and Anthony, 1027. Now, more of the worst of OV and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. The talk you can't ignore. 
[187:00]
 Dave writes, for your information, about two hours ago, Tom Brokaw was seen scuba diving in the ocean doing a live broadcast to see if JFK Jr. was faking his death.  He is hoping he will reappear from the water and catch him in the act.  Come on.  Well, you know, I don't think Tom Brokaw is in the water.  I believe finally the story is dead and they've run out of angles, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of the networks did get some scuba divers down there to see if something is going on. 
[187:30]
 But actually scuba diving?  Hmm?  Actually on the beach with scuba gear?  With scuba gear.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  You know, it's strange. I sound better with the regulator in my mouth than I do just trying to speak normally.  Normally.  Normally.  Hey, I'm Tom?  Yes, Tom Brokaw. 
[188:00]
 You sound a little out of it today.  Well, I...  You sound a little lightheaded or something.  I was deep diving looking for JFK Jr.  I don't believe he's dead.  I think it's a big conspiracy.  And I ran out of oxygen 200 feet below the surface and had to ascend so rapidly that Tom Brokaw, me, Tom Brokaw got the bends, nitrogen bubbles in my bloodstream.  So I'm a bit woozy. 
[188:30]
 But I do believe I did see JFK Jr.  Yeah.  When I was... just before I passed out, I also saw Ricochet Rabbit and the Care Bears.  They were all doing a dance.  And then someone pulled me out of the drink.  Yeah, Tom?  I believe it was a Navy vessel of grass still on site picking up any lost screw that came from JFK's plane at the cost of millions and millions of dollars.  I was... I was awed by Ariel, the Little Mermaid. 
[189:00]
 It was nice, you know.  She's got nice cans for a Clark's Moon mermaid little redhead chick.  You know, those mermaids, very deceiving.  Great cans, you could, you know, feel.  But if you try to go south, it gets a little fishy.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[189:30]
 I couldn't tell where the skin ended and the scales started as I tried making love to a mermaid.  On my next report, Tom Brokaw makes love to a mermaid, flipping up scales to find the elusive mermaid gash.  You know what the odd thing is?  It smells like human.  Yeah. 
[190:00]
 Tom, while we have you in the studio.  Yes, hopefully and happily.  What was the toughest thing you've ever had to say on the news?  I believe it was back in the 80s.  It had to be the day that...  The day Leon Klinghoffer was thrown off of the cruise ship Achillelaro. 
[190:30]
 The Achillelaro where a wheelchair bound Leon Klinghoffer was thrown overboard by terrorists  who took over the cruise ship Achillelaro.  Why do you always make Tom Brokaw say that?  Say what?  Achillelaro. 
[191:00]
 Oh, look at the time, they've refilled my oxygen tanks.  I am still searching for evidence of the death of JFK...  Well, good luck in the search, Mr. Brokaw.  Thank you, Opry and Anthony, as I now descend back into the depths.  Look out, people.  There he goes, Tom Brokaw.  Swimming away.  Tom Brokaw.  He's having sex with a mermaid. 
[191:30]
 I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  Identity.  What a bitch.  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  It's not on the CD because it's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks.  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  If you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced. 
[192:00]
 You're twelve.  I know.  Short marriage.  Okay.  How old are you?  I'm twenty-seven.  Twenty-seven?  Yeah.  And my wife was sixteen years, Erin, when I divorced recently.  And we have a little six-year-old girl.  She doesn't really understand why mommy isn't living with us anymore.  I did my best to write this little lullaby, perhaps explain it to her.  I'd like to set up this.  Great. Thanks. 
[192:30]
 I'll bring it down a little bit here. 
[193:00]
 Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Daddy likes porno and ten dollar horse.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores. 
[193:30]
 Daddy likes robbing the games little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Pretty.  On?  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke. 
[194:00]
 Daddy just wants to forget.  Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer. 
[194:30]
 Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his genitals oozing with pus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side. 
[195:00]
 Right after daddy gets home from the barn.  Visits his bookie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if daddy plays his cards right.  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears. 
[195:30]
 Even Dice is tearing up over there.  You got me.  You got my sensitive side.  Daddy loves you.  You're my daddy.  I'm your daddy.  I'm your daddy.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Even Dice is tearing up over there.  You got me.  You got my sensitive side.  Game.  Check case. 
[196:00]
 Who cares we can't play chocolate salty balls anymore.  We got some new songs.  That's Stephen Lynch.  His CD is called Half a Man.  You can order it by emailing him at pusshead.aol.com.  That marketing is really taking off.  That's not my forte.  And it's pusshead P-U-S not pusshead.  Which is P-U-S-S obviously.  What would everybody do before the internet?  Send me a postcard or something.  P-O-B-G. 
[196:30]
 Is that what you did?  I don't know.  Now more of the worst of Obie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  I must admit I ate monkey meat.  It was me.  Damn meat ahead.  Mr. Hassen was here.  I went into the zoo and had sex with Yoshi the Chimpanzee.  Damn meat ahead. 
[197:00]
 I couldn't help it.  After spending time on the Planet of the Apes.  I grew accustomed to that red chimpanzee ass.  Have you ever made love to a chimpanzee?  No I can't say I have.  Nothing like it.  You're a chimp you never go back.  That supple red ass.  Yearning.  I went to the zoo.  Yoshi spun around and faced that red ass at me. 
[197:30]
 It was yearning.  Calling me.  As was the burning bush when I played Moses.  Saying take this.  Thine red ass upon thee.  Make love to my red chimpanzee ass.  I must admit I ate monkey meat.  Damn meat ahead.  I ate monkey meat at the zoo. 
[198:00]
 Now Mr. Hassen.  Yes.  Why would you be attracted to a chimpanzee when you had Nova?  Nova.  Yes she was quite a babe in her loin cloth.  But she just didn't have enough bodily hair.  When Zira seduced me in that little cave thing they lived in.  And I did have a threesome with Zira and Cornelius.  I admit it. 
[198:30]
 I ate monkey meat.  I tasted the forbidden fruit of the monkey's red ass.  I couldn't resist.  I visited the zoo and saw Yoshi.  Little Yoshi.  And that red ass.  My God forgive me.  Lord God please forgive me.  For my taking of the forbidden meat of monkey.  Damn meat ahead.  Now Mr. Hassen there's a lovely picture of your girlfriend in Newsday.  Look at the cans on Yoshi.  My God.  I'm going to be a monkey. 
[199:00]
 I'm going to be a monkey.  I'm going to be a monkey.  I'm going to be a monkey.  My God.  That's the luckiest baby chimp I've ever seen.  Getting just snuggled against the bosom of that hairy ape.  Damn.  I love that monkey.  Alright.  I'll be making more visits to more zoos.  There might be a population explosion of Chartan chimps. 
[199:30]
 A new breed.  Chartan chimps.  Where's the toupee and that red ass.  Is it true also that you were Caesar's father?  Damn.  Damn you found me out.  My sex points were zero.  Yeah.  It was me.  Well we got the explanation to the chimp getting pregnant at the LA Zoo.  Well thank you Mr. Hassen. It's great.  I'm so embarrassed. 
[200:00]
 Can you take your little cherry and get out of the studio?  Where's my music?  Yah!  Off horse!  Yah!  Play my music damn you!  Alright I'll play your music.  Damn you!  Now get the hell out of here.  When are you putting those pictures up on the website?  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!  There he goes everyone.  Chompy Hassen.  Wow. 
[200:30]
 Chompy and Anthony.  Cuddlingus and psychiatry.  On FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.
