 The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW Meat Loaf from Bad Out of Hell. Kenny Wayne Shepard before that with Everything Is Broken.  That's a Bob Dylan song, of course. I think you know that by now. And Samaril Smith to get the program going here.  Meat Loaf behind the music.  Didn't he die in his behind the music too?  No, I think he's the only one so far.  No, he, like, they all have this near-death thing that happens home and I was clinically dead laying on the, in the dressing room floor.  Like, that's the big thing now for the behind the music and what are the other ones? 
[00:30]
 Behind the celebrity profile.  This one, who screwed up? Who lost the money? They're all laying there at one point.  And I had the needle in my arm and I was dead.  That was the Motley Crue one.  Oh, I saw that one just the other day.  That's probably the best one they've done thus far.  Boy, they sure were enjoying themselves, those boys.  They sure were.  Wow.  Did you hit, well, you saw it the other day.  Yeah.  Because we were talking about that on the way in a couple weeks ago.  Did you hear how they were so hooked on drugs and they had no drugs around that they started shooting themselves up with Jack Daniels? 
[01:00]
 Yeah, they'd take their needles that they usually shoot heroin with, put Jack Daniels and vodka in there and shoot that into their veins.  Mainline it.  Yeah.  Whatever it takes.  And did you hear about Ozzy?  Yeah.  Ozzy, they were touring with Ozzy and Ozzy at one point looks down and there's an ice cream stick  Yeah.  a line of ants going onto the ice cream stick.  Yeah.  You've seen it in your backyard or house somewhere. 
[01:30]
 Of course.  He goes down and snorts the line of ants like it was coke or something.  They're all in a line.  He's, hey, what is this over here?  Let me just go.  Just snorted ants.  The Motley Crue goes, that is one effed up mother.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Having fun.  So there you have it.  What's happening, brother?  How you doing?  We've been in a two hour meeting, so.  Yeah.  Now we got to focus on our little radio show here.  I like those meetings though. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, they're exciting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a lot out of them.  It's great.  It's really good.  So you got some aspirin?  The head's pounding.  Was anything accomplished in this meeting?  Yeah.  I think we focused.  We've refocused.  Did you take notes for us?  Oh, yeah.  Where's my notebook?  We're supposed to take turns.  Yeah.  And I didn't take notes this time.  I took notes as good as I ever did in high school.  Oh, we're in trouble.  We're in trouble.  I hope there's not a pop quiz later on today on what we learned at our meeting. 
[02:30]
 Right.  All of a sudden the boss comes running in with dittos.  Dittos.  OK.  We're going to have a quiz on your meeting.  It's going to count for half your grade.  Yeah.  You have to go into meetings when you're in radio and talk about how the show is going.  How's it feeling?  And the direction of things like the station.  Yeah.  We've got a new morning show coming on soon.  Right.  We have everyone in place now. 
[03:00]
 We're ready to rock.  Now we're finally ready to move forward.  We're moving.  Now we have no excuses.  None.  None whatsoever.  People in their cars going,  You should be best at the bit.  Give us some ratings.  The countdown has begun.  That's it.  They have turned the hourglass over.  Yeah, everything's in place.  No excuses left.  That's it.  You can't blame it on Muni.  We've got the big, huge hourglass from the Wizard of Oz in the corner now. 
[03:30]
 Here you go, my priggies.  You've got this much time to turn it around.  Whatever.  All right.  So let's get going here.  Yeah.  We have lots to talk about.  Our little Opie and Anthony prep sheet is filled with things to discuss today.  When I got a cover on the New York Post like this, who needs a prep sheet?  I mean emblazoned upon the cover of the New York Post in all its glory,  Corky Steinbrenner and Yogi Berra. 
[04:00]
 Yogi Berra.  We'll talk about them, I guess.  All right.  Yeah, I think before the show's over, you'll hear a little Corky.  All right.  Save it for later.  I'm not my best friend.  Fax line is 212-957-WAW.  Please send a nice fax.  Oh boy.  Instant feedback is set all...  Yogi Berra.  ...is set and ready for you.  Just go to WNEW website.  Piggie in the basket.  Yogi Berra, my best friend.  Piggie in the basket.  If you are going to use the instant feedback... 
[04:30]
 There's a kundog in there.  ...don't use it to say we suck or we rock.  You know, give us something we could use for the radio show, okay?  That's that.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Pink Floyd.  Eve Six before that inside out.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  And boy, oh boy, oh boy, am I excited.  It looks like I'm going to get to watch basketball this season after all.  You're going to watch? 
[05:00]
 I am going to go watch the NBA.  I can't wait.  They have settled the strike.  You're part of the problem then.  Well, I don't know.  I would boycott it.  I wouldn't even watch it on TV.  Well, they were talking to a lot of people in the streets today,  and a lot of people are going to boycott the season,  even though they're going to play a 50-game season starting, what, February 1st?  They're saying the place will be packed.  It doesn't matter.  All the places will be packed.  Without a doubt.  It'll take a few weeks, and then you'll have sellout crowds,  and then later on in the season, all of a sudden you're going to be reading your local paper going, 
[05:30]
 what?  They raised ticket prices again?  Ticket prices?  Why?  I wonder why.  Why this time?  And we'll all just accept it and go on.  Go ahead, Opie.  You watch.  Go ahead, watch.  Well, I don't know how I feel about this.  I really don't.  I know I'm not going to watch in the beginning.  I'm sure I'll get sucked in around the playoffs.  I did say if they cancel the season that I would never be a fan ever again.  But what do you do when they only cancel like half the season?  You know? 
[06:00]
 So have they totally decided when they're starting?  I think February 1st is what I'm hearing, and they're going to do what, 48 to 50 games,  and then regular playoffs.  I don't know.  We were listening to wins on the way in, and they were talking to someone on the street,  and he summed it up perfectly.  He says, screw the NBA.  I now watch college instead of the pros.  And he goes, because the college players play for the name on the front of their jerseys.  And the pros play for the name on the back of their jerseys.  I thought that summed it up perfectly. 
[06:30]
 Yeah.  Perfectly.  Making money hand over fist, those guys.  So they've settled the strike, and it just seems in general most people are like,  yeah, whatever.  Who cares?  We got the Jets to worry about anyway.  Yeah, exactly.  But then after that, then the Super Bowl is over, and then it's like we're in the dead  of winter, and baseball's a couple months away.  We're going to get rooked in.  It's a huge sports town here.  We're going to get rooked in.  Not me.  I'm not watching.  Because you hate basketball to be in with. 
[07:00]
 Well, yeah, but I won't watch.  Just on principle now.  Not even because I don't like it.  But on principle.  On principle?  Yes, I have my scruples open.  So I won't be able to come over your house?  No.  Take over the TV like I usually do?  Oh, thank God.  No basketball in my house.  Okay.  Thank God.  He comes over, grabs a remote, switches around like crazy, game to game.  Yeah, because there's like three games on at any given time.  I'll watch one thing at a time.  You can't even do that when it's not basketball. 
[07:30]
 That's just the way Opie watches TV.  Well, in general though, there's not much on TV these days where you can sit through the whole thing.  What was the last show you sat through?  There's a couple of shows I watched that I don't mind watching.  Everyone Loves Raymond.  That's funny.  The new show King of Queens.  That one's pretty good.  I like Just Shoot Me.  I could sit through that a little bit.  Sure.  I sit through ER without changing.  ER, NYPD Blue.  I sit through that.  Like that.  Now that Bobby Simone's dead, I have finally started watching again. 
[08:00]
 I have finally tuned in.  I wasn't going to sit and watch that soap opera Bobby Simone Dying.  Did you like Ricky Schroeder's ass?  Yeah.  Yeah, like second episode in, they have to have Rick Schroeder's ass.  This is to Harry ass.  Oh, that's right.  He's now Rick Schroeder.  Hey, it's Rick Schroeder.  Right.  Rick Schroeder.  Yeah, that's a good show.  Xena.  You know, I watch Xena.  The lesbian chick show.  Woo! 
[08:30]
 I like Xena's little chick friend there.  I haven't watched Xena in a while.  There's a whole dominant submissive lesbian relationship going on in Xena.  Really?  Yeah, she's got a little blonde crony girl and she totally looks up to Xena.  Xena's like, you know, they're in front of each other and Xena's just kicking guys'  asses.  Do they show any nip?  It's hard to see through, like, leather, chain mail.  But, you know, yeah, you see. 
[09:00]
 You know, Xena's pretty hot for a big Amazon dyke.  You know?  If you're into that, I mean, but her little blonde haired pal, that chick, she's kind  of cute.  I'll have to tune it in again.  I never found Xena hot.  There's something going on there between the two girls.  Alone, no.  Alone, Xena's like, there's that whole relationship between them that's really kind of hot.  When they're swinging swords and kicking ass.  It's great.  Cool.  What about when they took a bath together?  Oh yeah, they took a bath together. 
[09:30]
 What?  Yeah, they've been playing up this whole lesbian thing, man.  Yeah.  Well, Xena in real life is a lesbian.  How do you know?  She's married.  She's married.  Got a kid?  What's her name?  What's her husband's name?  I heard she was a lesbian in real life.  Yeah?  Don't call me that.  There were rumors.  There were rumors.  There were rumors, but she's married?  Yeah.  Yeah, but that could be a beard or something.  Maybe.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Who cares?  The show's kind of hot when they're taking baths together. 
[10:00]
 What we were talking about was the NBA strike.  It settled.  How'd that get there?  Well, that's what our show does.  It's all over the damn road.  Why don't these papers stay up here?  Okay.  You're a mess, man.  Why am I a mess?  I don't know.  Your papers are falling on the board.  You can't push the buttons.  Just the cluster.  Well, at least I got my headphones finally fixed.  I don't look like a Mickey Mouse anymore.  Yeah.  Bravo to engineering.  Opie submitted his headphones yesterday at, I believe, 3.05. 
[10:30]
 And at 3.41, he got them back.  3.41 today.  Would you have to solder?  Yeah, today.  Today.  It took 24 hours to fix a pair of headphones and then there's a solder wire.  It takes time for the soldering iron to heat up.  Now maybe they can fix our phone.  If you didn't punch it yesterday.  It's ridiculous when you try to dial out on this phone because you could key in the phone  buttons and like five to eight seconds after you push the button, it tones.  So it's like you push the button and then sometimes they go, 
[11:00]
 God damn, it was the last number.  And you guys start over.  So Opie just beat the crap out of the phone yesterday.  I did.  I figured if we beat it up enough and break it, they'll fix it.  Buttons popped off.  Have you seen a phone like this?  When was the last time they used a phone like this?  1930?  That's the one step up from having the wires that you have to move around, plug in.  Yeah, please hold.  One ringy dingy.  That phone system is, look at it. 
[11:30]
 It's a mess.  It's got wood in it.  Look it's wood.  There's wood.  Watch, watch this too.  Okay.  Count how many of these knobs I can make fall off with one punch.  Okay, go ahead.  Don't do that.  We need that phone.  It's like five to eight seconds.  Don't do that.  We need that phone.  It's like five knobs getting fallen off.  No one's calling today.  Stop.  We need the phone.  All right, give us a call.  I want to make sure the phone's still working.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York.  That's the band Train and Free.  Anyone else hear a little Marshall Tucker in there?  Yeah, a little bit.  Just a little bit. 
[12:00]
 Yeah.  A little Southern Rock feel there for you.  Soapy and Anthony, thanks for checking us out once again today.  Hey, Opie, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Thanks for having me today.  Hey, Ope, the phone's working again?  Yeah, why wouldn't they be working, Anthony?  Well, since they didn't work for a good half hour after you pummeled the phone.  Why are you getting me in trouble?  Well, maybe it will teach you. 
[12:30]
 You shouldn't do stuff like that.  Well, we have a crappy phone system and I just punched it a couple times.  Made it even crappier.  It didn't work at all.  Good work.  Maybe people are just not calling.  No, I see it blinking now.  Oh, all right.  What's your problem?  Hello?  See, it works.  Okay.  It works.  You ass.  That's what we usually get when we go to the phones.  Yeah.  Sorry.  All right.  Someone was talking about Xena and the instant feedback. 
[13:00]
 Yeah, it seems that they're, let's see, Ro from New York emailed us.  Xena and her sidekick have also kissed on the mouth, mouth to mouth on the show, and  profess their love for one another.  Come on.  Yeah, the two cast members have been asked about the characters' relationship and they  say the chemistry is being shown on purpose between them and that they'll be exploring  their relationship further. 
[13:30]
 And then she goes on to say, I've read and been told by more than one person that the  duo is quite a hit at Meow Mix, a lesbian bar on Houston Street.  They watch on Saturday night at the bar and have Xena dress up nights.  You should send someone down to report for you.  There's a lesbian bar called Meow Mix.  Meow Mix.  I got to hand it to the gay community.  They sure can come up with some catchy names for their bars.  Like the guys' gay bars.  What was the old one in New York?  The Mind Shaft.  The Mind Shaft.  I'm going to go down to the Mind Shaft. 
[14:00]
 Or Piledriver.  I'm going to go to Fisties tonight.  Meow Mix is a lesbian bar on Houston.  That's a cute little name for a bar.  Gee, I wonder what that means.  No clope.  Meow.  Let's see.  Cat.  A feline.  A pussy.  A kitten.  A cat.  No, I don't see any tie-in whatsoever.  I'm going down to the Bearded Clam tonight. 
[14:30]
 See ya.  Meet me down at Stink Fish.  I'll be there tonight at Xena night.  You had to go one too far.  Why?  Why?  We were all having fun.  Stink Fist?  I didn't say that.  All the others were cute little lesbian bar names and you had to go over the edge once  again.  I said Stink Fish.  Oh.  Oh, I said Stink Fist.  Say you're the...  Oh, please.  I swear to God I thought you said Stink Fist.  What a mess.  Let's just shut up. 
[15:00]

If we're not allowed, it's too late now.  Yeah, next Monday at 2, the Black Crows will be in the studio.  Okay. 
[15:30]
 But they are definitely on tonight at 10.  10 o'clock tonight?  Yeah, they're going to play a new album and they're going to play a couple of ditties  for us.  Nice.  All right.

I don't think you'd be hooking up with her again  It's the only way we'd so jealous Ben, please just get over it  Obviously it's because we aren't out in the New York clubs banging things 
[30:30]
 frauds every night girls guys, whatever  The Rock of New York 1027 w-new Dave Matthews bandstays, hope you Anthony, you know, we just had a discussion about Princess Leia  Yeah, what?  Production director Jimmy thinks that Princess Leia was hot well for the time he was saying, you know back then especially when you were a kid  When you first saw that weren't you a kid? I was a kid  Yeah, there's a kid you walk in Princess Leia's kind of you know, she was kind of cute for the whole thing 
[31:00]
 Was a space thing. No, no, no, no, no, Bo Derek hot Princess Leia not hot  See, I didn't find my Derek hot back then because I was a kid and that was a grown woman and she was a little  Intimidating Princess Leia was more a girl. I couldn't get past the mr. Sophie softy  Hairstyle isn't mr. Softy. It was like all twisty. It's like a day. Yeah  He had some some poppin fresh cinnamon rolls on the side of it. I couldn't get past that look 
[31:30]
 Well, that was the space look open you don't understand the future  That's how well all the girls will have their hairstyle. You really thought she was hot not hot  It was it was for the time being a kid. She was she was more  Relatable than a Bo Derek Bo Derek was like someone's mom hot  She was hot  Jeannie hot see I didn't Princess Leia. No, no back then  I didn't find stuff like that hot to me like a Valerie Bertinelli was hot because she was cute 
[32:00]
 It was it was more relatable to my age  I wasn't gonna look at a grown woman and think she's hot when I was a kid  Why caused it was intimidating was like someone's mom. Let's look at my teachers and think they were hot  So you have some kind of issue? You definitely have an issue man  You never found women hot Marsha Brady that type of thing hot. She's too young for me  No, it was the same age still now Carol Brady hot. Oh god. Come on 
[32:30]
 Mr. Brady  No, I just don't find I didn't find  Women that age like Bo Derek hot didn't have fantasies about older women when you were like 12 13  No, it was so I'm really only one it was just not relatable  I couldn't couldn't get a grasp on it Suzanne Somers. No, I didn't work for me back then  How old were you when three companies? I don't know 
[33:00]
 Like what 12 yeah doesn't work hot. No, I was I was this is Roper. I would look at  That muumuu wow  And she wanted some all the time, but mr. Roper always denied her  the mighty Roper Schwann  Now I couldn't I needed girls like more my age 
[33:30]
 That I would watch movies or TV shows and you know  Let me get into that whole thing now everyone's calling see what they want Rick because no one knows how to do the phones  Right yet. We try to put you guys on the air, but they curse and we got a radio still on in their house  Hi any W. Yeah, what's going on? Hey? I think the word Anthony's looking for regarding Princess Leia is Fox  Really wasn't really hot, but she was cute. I agree with them  Oh that brings up now that you mention that word Fox though that does bring up another girl that I used to love 
[34:00]
 Was who's the one that married McEnroe? Oh  yeah  O'neill Tatum. Yeah Tatum O'neill that was more my speed and the Bad News Bears  She looked like a guy no not the Bad News Bears in that camp movie  Was that one never found her? Huh? No?  You're looking at someone's mom. What are you doing?  To me like a Bo Derek was an old woman. Oh Bo Derek naked you're 12 or 13th. You're denying I 
[34:30]
 Like Tatum O'neill better  I  Probably like Kristy McNichols. I saw Dyke a mile away even at that age  He loved family  Admitting he like Kristy McNichols  My god, it's like a boxing with a retard  Oh 
[35:00]
 What's up, you never had a crush on like that girl or cat when you were growing up at woman  I know I was like thank you how old five or six, but I was dying for  Nostalgic definitely which one though only do we knew more not not earthy kid  Kid I should give you some  Jaw  None of them things up  Just thinking about that so you could relate to what I'm saying where you're younger, but you're having fantasies about older women 
[35:30]
 It's like the girl in the Avengers. Oh  Yeah, yeah, Diana rigged in a rig right. I kind of like they're in a tight suit, but not know  She was older than you. I don't know. It was more it was more of an interesting thing to look at no  Yeah, okay that that looks nice, but it was no there were no fantasies because how am I gonna?  I can't make that relatable to me. They had a fantasy about Tatum O'neill  What's that?  When I was her age back someone like in a tight leather outfit, but it's more enticing now of course 
[36:00]
 But I'm talking about when I was that age and did you have a fantasy of play like air hockey with data?  Yeah, I wanted to play air hockey with that  What I've been waiting all afternoon for Corky. I will get the Corky in a little bit  Yeah  Rider home on my little motorcycle 
[36:30]
 And from the price is right honest that was a woman  I'm with you. You know I'm with you  I think she's still hot is she the only one remaining  One one still remaining  Watch it because the work all right man, but she's cool. I like Laurie Partridge. She was older than me 
[37:00]
 All right, not really throw that in I like the mom  What I like the Gloria Hickey  Like the Princess Leia you guys are looking at the wrong movie you got to check out return of the Jedi when she's in the slave  Gear bound the chain. Oh, yeah, we're job of the hut like trying to get him get himself some that's it  Yeah, yeah, she was kind of hot in that I can accept that a lot better than the buns on the side of that 
[37:30]
 Yeah, the Danish look before that happening before the dope took its toll on her  again all bloated  Waste on the only job  Thanks  Enough calls for now. Yeah, take a little break here. Look how different we are. Oh, but you say  Some kind of mother fixation and I was completely normal. That's nice. Okay a minute  Well, I'm a 13 year old kid 12 13 looking at 12 and 13 year old girls as attractive and wanting to have like a little girlfriend 
[38:00]
 Oh, and I'm working and you're looking at women old enough to be your mom  Oh, and I'm outrageous cuz at 12 or 13, I like Bo Derek Suzanne Somers Jeannie and Mrs. Roper  The Rock of New York 1027 W any w Lenny Kravitz fly away  It's open Anthony and we're getting into an interesting discussion here  The phones are lighting up like crazy another one of the stupid open Anthony discussions that mean absolutely nothing 
[38:30]
 And I absolutely the fan is discussing the NBA  Settlement and we're talking about who we thought was hot when we were 12 years old  Well, I don't get movies well, I'm gonna defend myself on this one  Cuz cuz I get the bad rep for being the psycho on the show now I OP when I was 12 or 13  fantasized about  Farrah Fawcett  Mm-hmm  Bo Derek 
[39:00]
 Jeannie  Suzanne Somers  All older women, right? Okay. They were too too old for me at that age. I didn't like that  It was like my mom's friends or something. So Anthony had fantasies about  Tim O'Neill Tatum O'Neill was more my age the little girl Valerie Barton family  The little red partridge no the little one  Danny 
[39:30]
 Girl Gloria Hickey and Jodie Foster that she was a little too young  And  Christy McNichols, I didn't like Christy McNichol. I thought that came up. No the whole cast of that  Little camp movie that Tatum O'Neill made  They were all hot, but you just entire cast you didn't fantasize about  Suzanne Somers, I didn't like Jeannie and Bo Derek didn't like them  It was too old for me at that age as I grew older obviously. Yes, they're very very attractive 
[40:00]
 Hi, any W. Hey guys, how you doing? Good listen  Farrah Fawcett nobody's mentioned. This is the only hot angel, you know, the other two were like moms back in the 70s  No, man, Cheryl lad when she was doing a little snorkeling thing underwater  Remember that Cheryl lad was hot because she was perking kind of cute looking  You remember Farrah before the angels in my movie Logan's run, of course  No, and she was I mean I was in seven. Well, I asked Anthony Anthony you were 12 13 years old was Farrah Fawcett hot 
[40:30]
 No better the original angels come on it's too, uh, no to do out of your room for me  She just seemed like an older woman  I didn't really like so you would have a fantasy about Tatum O'Neill before you'd have one about Farrah Fawcett back then  Yeah, you're screwed  My age  Was it gonna hang that poster up a heart with the friggin pencil erases  I don't remember any Tatum O'Neill not only did I hang up the poster. I got the matching garbage can 
[41:00]
 I  Did  You have the matching garbage can yeah the garbage fell lunchbox and thermos or anything now we were too poor for that  Oh, we took our lunch shot to school in a big huge wall-bound paper bag  That a cool song or what?  The rock in New York one or two seven w-new  That come out of that song with a little bit of a mellow attitude the FM jock attitude 
[41:30]
 Yeah, that's ever last. What is what it's like from Whitey Ford sings the blues. It's opiate Anthony  Thanks for checking us out today. We really appreciate that. Thank you  What a little can of worms we opened up here. Yeah, and people won't drop this subject  We want to move on to other things, but I don't know how it started at this point  But Anthony didn't fantasize about  Bo Derek and Suzanne Somers and fire floss and when he was 12 or 13  He had he had more or less fantasies or was into girls like Tatum  O'Neill girls my own age at the time who else though Tatum O'Neill anyone anyone down the cast of the movie little darlings little darlings 
[42:00]
 Okay  Also when I was younger the the girl from Nanny and the professor the blonde haired  Come on she was cute is this a bit for the radio you didn't have fantasies about like Cheryl T  Well Cheryl tees was kind of hot  But no, it was just something that was unattainable and and very out of wasn't my age  When I'm 12, I was looking at girls that were 12. You're into Marsha Brady 
[42:30]
 Yeah, I found nothing hot about her when I was 12 or 13  You watch the Hawaiian episode  You get nothing out of watching her at the hula class the Hawaiian episode with the little grass skirt  On the top you want to play that even Jan looked good in that for some some bizarre reason, you know  That'll be a good way to end this discussion  Well, we're the Marsha Brady song because Anthony was so into Marsha Brady. He wrote a little song about her 
[43:00]
 I wrote a little ode to her. Yeah, it's true. All right. So basically let me set this up here  I was into Bo Derek Suzanne Somers Farrah Fawcett when I'm odd Esther roll when I was 12 or 13  Anthony was into girls more his age and that's bizarre. You call that bizarre. You're 12  You're looking at what women when I looked at women like  Like that that of that age. I thought of my mom's friends. Jeannie like they well I  Understood they were hot. I didn't look and go. Ew. I looked and went. Oh, that's a pretty lady 
[43:30]
 You know, it's it's a it's a woman. That's like my mom's friend. I didn't use pretty or lady in my fantasy  I don't know what you're thinking at 12 years old. I'll be first of all, what do you got bro?  When I was 12 years old I had a class full of 12 year olds to look at  Instead TV was for fantasizing and exploring stuff man Wonder Woman  Dude, Wonder Woman Wonder Woman Wonder Woman was the epitome of the woman that was like my mom's friend 
[44:00]
 Me anytime  I can go look at man  We gained a mega listener  No, I just didn't see that as something that I would be interested in sexually and that's what separates you from us 
[44:30]
 Right all be who you into well this guy hit on the head with the facts. How about Jimmy's sister on good times Thelma?  Yeah, but she was like 17. So that was kind of she was kind of hot kind of I  Stole that playboy because she was so hot still a little frightening for me because you know, that was the crossover  little jungle fever  12 or 13 Oh be a little taboo there. I don't know. That's what made the fantasy even cooler and hotter. I 
[45:00]
 Don't know. Yeah, let me play a little music for you. Maybe this will get you hot  Or I feel like that mod  Betty white  God I love that Betty white  Still getting now she's the hot one out of all of them 
[45:30]
 She's short you can rest a beer on her head  That's the fantasies I had yeah, it's sick. Oh, yeah, you are sick. You're into these old women  Yeah, our processes and services all yeah, I just love me when you're 12  They were and I looked at them as women. All right, so the older women fine. I got a song for you 
[46:00]
 You know, this is not what I meant  I  Put on my romper stompers and go to town  Okay, good. Well, we wasted too much time here very cute. We do have Anthony's Marsha Brady song 
[46:30]
 1027 W any W the Rock of New York David Bowie Jean Genie Sophie and Anthony  Hey, I started my words today. No one I haven't noticed why you're drinking.

Yeah  Come on  Goddamn, I hate this  What it would cause that this time this well I get them from stress and and the Sun I was down in Florida 
[47:00]
 So this is all right the Sun. Yeah, so I'm hoping this is a Sun one. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's it's not too embarrassing  And you're walking around the halls and everyone just cares at it. Yeah. Yeah, I look like a dork  I got a big  Dora my lip  Like like they're so tight  All right, I figured I'd just bring it out in the open because you 
[47:30]
 Wasn't gonna say anything. Well, what do you think you obviously see it? I don't throw rocks man  Okay, not when I come in sometime with a huge friggin poon on the side of my head  Big or one of those Dudley do right zits on my chin. Yeah, that's great  Oh look, I look like Dudley do right a big Cyrano de Bergerac one on my nose or something  I'm not saying a word about your lip. Your lip looks just fine. Cool. Cool. I appreciate that 
[48:00]
 My nose I went staring I figured I'd get it out the old deal with the lip balm  I'm with the stridex we both shut up. Everything's fine  All right. Hey your brother's checking in Anthony. What does Joe want? Well Joe  He's gonna  Analyze you he thinks he knows why you're into older women  Not into older women not into older women when you were younger when I was younger  I wasn't into the older women that were on TV. I was into the girls that were my age 
[48:30]
 Yeah, and he's figured it out. Yeah  I can explain Anthony's aversion to older women. I think I'm not positive  But I think I can  Yeah  Anyway Buzz was Buzz was older 
[49:00]
 she was much older than Anthony and she you know, she was a friend of my dad's and and his wife and  Well, there were a lot of there were a lot of those girls out there  They were older and they had the morals of like the crack house, but they um, just one particular girl buzz  Was the first one to let's say let Anthony know the pleasures of manhood  And  If my memory serves me correctly and correct me if I'm wrong because I don't want to lie 
[49:30]
 Buzz had a pretty nice bod. She had major dairy. She was pretty good. Yeah, but she had like that connecting eyebrow thing  Like foliage above her eyes  She had like a distended forehead  And  An undercut jaw like a neanderthal  More like a chrome anion. Yes. Yeah, I think she was what 20 she was 20 at 21 so much that Anthony was about 13 
[50:00]
 Wait, how did this come about? The old man hooked it up? Yeah on my 13th birthday  He left her there to babysit  Yeah, and then him and his wife went out and I thought we were just gonna sit and watch TV  And this girl buzz goes why don't you go up and take a shower? I'm like, okay  It's still not figuring it out. I get out of the shower and I go to walk downstairs and from my father's room  I hear aren't you coming in?  Still I'm like, oh what you doing in here?  What I turn and look in the bedroom all sudden she's sitting there and the sheet is up to her belly with the huge 
[50:30]
 And then I just like oh my god here it is  Yeah, I crawled in there and I didn't I didn't take my underwear off  So like she's running her hand down my side and she goes she gets the under is like gonna take these off 
[51:00]
 That's pretty much that's what I figured Anthony's a version to older women  That's a wow you psychoanalyze me yeah, so you ought to be a shrink when you're not a you know making duct work  Brushfire in here the abuse starts on one guy. It's like do that. I'm fighting for dear life. Yeah fighting back 
[51:30]
 First of all at the same time in California, yeah, Joe was what a year and a half older than me  So what were you 14? Yeah, yeah, he's banging some 35  Yeah, and I swear to God she had hips on her like she could have birthed a baby  I 
[52:00]

It's kind of like the the pyramid does you know scheme 
[53:00]
 You got a lot you got to be careful with these things  They could all crumble at any given moment, but use them to make money on right now right now  Anthony's starting to do a little day trading with the internet stocks. I'm proud of  I was screwing around a little Amazon today. They split three ways the other day  So the shares were affordable again mm-hmm picked it up at  125 a share upi now.

[55:00]
 You know I am barely off the plane. I am in the parking lot at McGonagall  And I turn on the radio I can still hear a little bit of the boys and I got a tune into that  Anthony we shared a bedroom at one point if I remember correctly  That's why buzz was babysitting she wasn't babysitting for me. She was babysitting for you  You were asleep and the one thing I remember  Remember you was ugly 
[55:30]
 You have a beautiful wife you've had some pretty girlfriends and stuff, but she was ugly  Now I know why Anthony abused me so bad about how I lost my virginity you want this to come out  I  Am not nice and I'll be um I'm not the only one getting abused today 
[56:00]
 What do you actually you're not really getting abused this way people being very sympathetic about what do you other people can relate to your story?  About having to bring your lunch to school when you're a kid in that big shopping bag  All the big oh we talked about that earlier. Yeah  I'm not kidding gang. This is so sad man  What's those say I was one of seven?  Didn't have a lot of money to go out and get the little cute brown lunch bag. How much were little lunch bags? 
[56:30]
 I understand where to call it much money, but  Poor people tend to live in classes  Oh  So we may do it's what we had around the house and my life  Hell or bag was the big huge brown wall-bound shopping bag and he had to fold it up and bring it home when you were  Done with it  Like it recycled so so that one. It's not even nicely creased. I just crumbled up 
[57:00]
 With no real distinction out just looks like a big gunny sack  Yeah  That's how I brought my lunch to school  That's sad. I am a W a Opie. I don't good  It's the truck driver that was going to home last month remember? Yeah, what's up?  You know, I'm listening you guys you guys are tremendous  But I'm listening you talk about your childhood and you know when you talk about the paper bags

 I'm surprised you're not a recovering alcoholic  I went through some of the same stuff. I'm in recovery now, you know  Some of the feelings you're kicking up, you know, I need to remember, you know  Well, you're at the bus stop and all your friends have the Star Wars lunch  Lunch box  And and Brady Bonds and you're sitting there with a big huge brown wall

 I know we got one haircut a year that that was a good one  What was that delicacy you used to eat  I  Talked us into believing that bread and sugar sandwiches were not only healthy for you 
[59:30]
 But they tasted good that way you couldn't tell you were eating sand in your sandwich  You  Know how everyone had the the ice pops right? Yeah, you used to put them in the freezer and freeze them  Well when I went to my grandma's house, I'm one of like 30  Grandchildren not only would she cut those in half  She'd refill them with orange juice and put it back in the freezer with watered down 
[60:00]
 So I got some problems  I  Am the normal one you should talk to my brothers. Oh, yeah. Oh man, my brothers will make you cry laughing  Now the thing with the sandwiches and the real fast  Yeah, it wasn't just bread and sugar sandwiches. The sugar would obviously fall out  Oh, there's got a method to this. Well, it was margarine

[63:30]
 He was corky from life goes on looks just like him he still got the crazy Eddie outfit on  Crazy Georgie  Well people want to hear that Marsha Brady song we can leave with that today good after the theme of part of today's show anyway  Yeah, if you weren't listening throughout the whole show 
[64:00]
 You missed a lot today. Yeah, you really did. We finally had a good show hit on a lot  Sometimes it happened like lotto  You got to be in it to win it sometimes I listen it's a good one. Sometimes all is babbling actually makes sense  but uh  Tomorrow will return you to your regular me scheduled program  All right, well we got on the discussion I said when I was 12 or 13 out is fantasizing about  women like Bo Derek and genius Suzanne Somers and Cheryl tees and 
[64:30]
 Anthony said they were too old for him at 12 or 13 and he had more the fantasies  with women Tatum O'Neill or ladies like Tatum O'Neill and it was a good one and  Christie McNichols well not Christie McNichols so much. I didn't like I liked the chick from different strokes  Oh, yeah, the sister and that Dana Plato. She turned into a real good crack  Oh, didn't you could tell her in early age? She was just gonna be a slut bag  She had a great ass on her. Yeah 
[65:00]
 Yeah, so and you had a crush on Marsha Brady when you were 12 or 13 would it?  Well, no not that old I was I was like nine I think nine okay, I'd never found her that hot  No, no, cuz I was into like I said, Jeannie and then the rest of them like Marsha  Jamie Somers  Huh?  What what what the Bionic woman Bionic woman? Oh god, I was like every teacher I had I was in those  Unsexual thing ever I was into Jamie Somers. Oh 
[65:30]
 Oh  Fantasize about her big time. Oh  One thing that annoyed me about that show  You know how she had the bionic powers and stuff and she could lift the cars and stuff. Yeah  What you've heard this one? No, no, I'm just wondering  Cuz I had a problem with a few things like that too. All right. Well, she's lifting the car, right?  Yeah, and she's so powerful and stuff, right? Did she have bionic high heels on to  Heels never broke they never broke I never 
[66:00]
 Understand that but I never understood what Steve Austin had the bionic arm.
