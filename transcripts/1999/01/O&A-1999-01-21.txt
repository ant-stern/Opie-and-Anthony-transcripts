 The Rock of New York 1027W-NEW.  You two playing with Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson.  April 6th, Hammerstein Ballroom.  Ticket info to come right here at NEW.  That's the tribute to Johnny Cash that they are putting together.  Good afternoon, it's Opie Flying Solo, my buddy, my pal, who sits across from me is home.  Very, very sick.  If you're a faithful listener to the show, you probably heard it in his voice yesterday.  Funniest man alive, had to take a day off on me.  And a lot of people are faxing in Anthony because I know Anthony's listening. 
[00:30]
 We're going to call him once an hour to see how he's doing.  But Hoover writes, tell Anthony to have some tronia.  It'll straighten him right up.  And this one's really good from Johnny.  You know, it's never safe around the opening of the show, even when we're down and out and sick.  You guys will still abuse us.  That's what we like about you guys, because I'm suffering from a fever myself here.  But Johnny writes, hey, tell Ak to take off his skirt and get back to work. 
[01:00]
 Ask him if he's wearing feety pajamas.  Ask him, did Snooki, aka the wife rub Vicks on his chest and pillow?  I hated when my mom did this.  Did Ak take his temperature rectally?  And by the way, play the 100 grand call.  We are going to play the your favorite opening Anthony bits today, by the way, if you want to give us a call.  Rick's working the phones to one, two, seven, five, seven, one, two, seven.  But I'll put this aside and we'll ask Anthony all these fine questions, Johnny.  So thanks for checking in.  Well, if you were listening yesterday, we had our our buddy, our pal Steven Lynch. 
[01:30]
 He's going to be huge.  I'm telling you right now, he's going to be just incredibly big.  And he came in to do some songs.  And I think I can play this one.  One, two, seven, W, A, W, the rock of New York, Metallica from garage.  They turn the page.  It's all be playing solo today.  I'm very, very sick man.  We're going to be checking in with him in a little bit.  We'll bust his balls.  We're going to call him every hour today, even though he's trying to get some rest. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, that's it.  And in the studio helping me out today, because I'm just not used to doing a radio show by myself.  It's been many, many years.  And it's kind of strange being in Ralph.  I don't know how you do it.  Well, yourself, you're out here by himself.  And he just stares at a blank wall and acts like he's talking to you guys, the listeners.  I get the privilege of at least talking to Anthony.  You know what I mean?  It's the old theater of the mind.  I get to use it all the time.  Yeah.  But you know, if you're at home right now, try to talk to yourself and make believe you're  having a conversation with someone.  It's not easy to do. 
[02:30]
 I got the phone calls.  All people, lots of nice people on the phones.  You're happy that helps.  All right.  What do you got on Metallica?  Because you're the music man.  Ralph knows everything.  I listen to your show and I get scared.  What do you know about all these bands?  What do you got on Metallica?  Give me anything.  They're playing in San Francisco with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.  Yeah.  In middle of April, something like that.  They're going to record it.  If it comes out good, they're going to put it out.  If it doesn't, foot legs for everyone.  Think there's going to be a mosh pit there. 
[03:00]
 Can you imagine they were talking about they'll come out in black tie and make the orchestra  wear black leather.  Yeah, that means at least Michael Kamen should come out in black leather.  He's going to be conducting very good.  Yeah.  All right.  Also today on the show, you could request your favorite opiate Anthony bits.  We'd like to do this from time to time is a perfect day considering half the team is  on here.  Do you got a favorite opiate anything by Yoshi?  You want to hear some Yoshi?  The guys on the phone.  Hey, I'll hear anything by that band.  Yeah, anything by Yoshi.  Anything by Yoshi.  OK, Rick, what are they requesting so far? 
[03:30]
 All right.  So far, let's see three requests for the 100 grand.  We've got a few requests for the Tourette's Warehouse Call off the Demented World.  OK, Lullaby, Stephen Lynch.  Yes.  Very good.  Old Bill, old Bill crossing the street, crossing the street.  OK, a request for that.  All right.  The Duck Job, Donald Duck, the Gerbil song, the Stephen Lynch favorite.  OK, and a new one to the list.  What?  I expect the area to run down here any moment.  The pre-song. 
[04:00]
 Didn't they erase that?  Isn't that like out of the studio altogether?  Yeah, we don't have a copy that anymore.  There are things we do on our show that we will only do once.  So it's good to tape the show from time to time.  You got a copy of the pre-song.  You got a very special moment from the Open Empathy Show.  Make your own bootleg.  Yes, you can make your own bootleg and pass around on the Internet or whatever.  Well, we can play the 100 grand call real fast.  We get so many calls for this damn thing to track off our Demented World CD.  You ever hear this, Ralph?  I'm not sure. 
[04:30]
 Is this when you call somebody and tell them they won 100 grand?  Well, no, we went on the radio and just said that we were going to give away 100 grand.  Never said money.  Just said 100 grand.  Giving away 100 grand.  Coming up next hour.  100 grand.  You gave away.  No.  I'm a rock in New York, one of these seven W and W guns and roses Paradise City and  Matchbox 20 before that with long day.  It's Opie and and and and Anthony.  There he is.  Hi.  And Ralph the Taurus sitting in trying to help me out a little bit. 
[05:00]
 I want you.  Thanks, Ralph.  No problem.  And I'm waiting.  Why do you?  I can't sit in your chair, though.  I'm the next one over.  I wouldn't use that mic anyway.  That's one of the reasons.  Oblubonic plague.  Yeah, it's kind of strange.  It's like no one is sitting in your seat.  Your microphone is just kind of hanging there.  Infected.  Did you ever see the Leonard Skinner tribute band?  That's what it's like.  They play free bird just put the mic with them.  There's a spotlight on your microphone.  There's just a spotlight on your on your microphone and your Sam Adams has just kind 
[05:30]
 of hanging from the microphone.  We got a laptop set up, too.  We got just.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a fake laptop.  But in memorial, it's almost like you're there.  It's kind of strange.  There's your little bell.  Great.  So how you feeling?  That's all good.  Rocky Balboa just beat the crap out of Clubber Lang.  Yeah, OK.  I could buy 25 baby babies that are sure to go up in value.  And Judge Judy is really good. 
[06:00]
 So my day is just great.  And there's no Brady Bunch reruns on.  No.  What's on Nickelodeon?  The audience has a stupid card like Doug on or something.  Yeah, I like Doug.  It's a fake.  Yeah, Doug said I was it.  You got Warner Brothers cartoons, but they hit each other with sledgehammers.  Of course.  How you hold it up there?  Hold down the fort.  Barely.  I'm just not used to doing a radio show by myself. 
[06:30]
 Yeah, it's kind of strange.  Oh, Johnny sent the facts.  I got to ask you a couple of questions.  All right.  Hey, take off your skirt and get back to work.  Ask him if he's wearing feety pajamas.  No, actually, I'm in the sweats.  OK.  Did Snooki, aka the wife, rub Vicks on your chest and pillow?  No, Vicks.  I hate that stuff.  All right.  He said he hated when his mom did that to him.  And everyone wants to know if you took your temperature rectally. 
[07:00]
 Yeah, you're a dirty boy.  I'm a dirty boy.  I can't even do any voices.  It's blowing, man.  It's just blowing.  Well, that's why we're having the listeners call up with their favorite  opiate Anthony Betts and we're going to play some of them today.  So.  All right.  The serofluor is like heroin.  Is it really?  Oh, my God.  They should just give you works with it. 
[07:30]
 Like tie off, boot up.  Just mainline the stuff.  Oh, I'm a mess.  All right.  Well, can you stick around for the Priceline read it?  I would have it any other way.  You're going to try to get the letter.  Oh, I didn't do that.  All the all the characters called in sick today.  It's just strange when that happens.  It's like, OK, well, Anthony's sick, but at least, you know, Yoshi's not sick.  And dice won't be sick.  And William Shatner and everyone called in sick.  It's kind of strange. 
[08:00]
 I don't get terrible.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  All right.  Well, stick around and do the Priceline read with me.  OK.  And everyone is requesting the the Popeye bit.  We're going to play one of them today.  Oh, I get to hear what I used to sound like.  Yeah.  I think we'll play the one from Tuesday late in the show.  All right, Anthony, still there?  Anthony.  What?  Anthony, turn on your radio.  We're in delay.  Hello, Anthony.  Oh, oh, thank you. 
[08:30]
 What?  Anthony.  Oh, what do I?  Oh, oh, the delay delay.  Oh, sorry.  Hi.  Long time listener.  First time caller.  It must be the Nyquil.  Turn down your radio.  You asked me that old that old gag, that old ploy, that old ruse.  All right.  It's Priceline.com, Anthony.  I wish Priceline had like voice boxes.  I could name my own price for a new voice box.  That would be nice. 
[09:00]
 Well, you can name your own price for a hotel room.  But you're not going to be going away in the near future, are you, Anthony?  No, I have my own little hotel room set up here.  Yes.  Okay.  Well, if you're going away in the near future, you need a hotel room, you need a  flight, give Priceline.com a call, 1-800-Priceline, and they will match your price.  You call them, you tell them, I want to pay this much for a damn hotel room, and  they get back to you and they take care of you.  Why wouldn't you take advantage of this?  And if you use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night, Anthony. 
[09:30]
 Oh, great.  So I'll use it tonight.  So if you're on the internet, give Priceline.com a try, www.Priceline.com, or  you could give them a call, 1-800-Priceline.  All right.  Anything else to say about Priceline, Anthony?  No, not right now.  I have to medicate.  All right.  I need more dope.  What's the next medication you're going to put into your system?  What time is it?  Let's say 425.  Um, I think I have to take some more Robitussin. 
[10:00]
 Oh, that should be fun.  And then, yeah, I'm coming up on having to take some more Theraflue.  Are you mixing your cold medicine?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I am mixing, matching.  I'm having some kind of reaction where I'm growing fins, I think.  Are you making your own version of Long Island Ice Tea?  Yeah, with some over-the-counter drugs.  Yeah, I'm right on.  All right, we're going to check in with you at 515.  I'll be listening.  Because everyone really cares about you.  I bet. 
[10:30]
 I've heard the facts that you've been reading.  They just want to abuse you so bad.  I know.  All right, man.  Give me a break.  Hang in there, right?  Yeah.  All right, exactly.  I'll be right back.  Buddy's Man Alive, sit home.  Home sick, I should say.  1027-W-N-E-W, the rock of New York, Bad Company with Bad Company.  Off the CD, Bad Company.  Very nice, very original.  It's Opie and Ralph DeTour hanging with me for a little while.  Hello there.  I think he's going to be bailing out.  I see you got your train schedule in front of you.  Yeah, I took the train schedule out. 
[11:00]
 You know, honey, I won't be on the 404.  OK.  I don't know.  I'm looking at where I'm going to go now.  I'll figure it out later.  You should do the whole show with me today.  I'm shorthanded.  Yeah.  I'll call Mrs. T, see if she's got any plans for me today.  OK.  And if I don't have to be anywhere at any specific time.  Now the Super Bowl winning starts tomorrow, huh?  I'm very excited about that.  Now, I don't pay attention in the meetings around here.  So what's going on with that?  They tell people to call.  Yeah, they call.  OK.  They win a Web TV.  OK.  From Sony. 
[11:30]
 All right.  All right.  And then I'll be with guys and then they'll be in the drawing for the Miami.  Right.  Wow.  A Web TV to start, which is great.  OK.  And then to get the grand prize.  Oh, you're in Miami.  And we're doing this all weekend long.  Starting tomorrow with Steve Mason.  Absolutely.  At nine a.m., I would assume somewhere around there.  It's a good ballpark.  Actually gets off the air at nine.  So.  What he does.  Hummer Queen.  OK.  So keep listening for details.  Is she on Priceline now? 
[12:00]
 Hummer Queen.  Yeah.  No.  OK.  Make your own price for a Hummer.  That's what I want to see.  Priceline.com get into.  Well, they do the flights.  Right.  They do the hotel room.  They're doing mortgages.  They're doing mortgages now.  What do you all kinds of stuff?  Name your own price for a Hummer.  Now, that's that's a commercial.  We could really support.  We don't want the people from Priceline.com.  Medit.  We know we're just we love those guys.  All right. 
[12:30]
 Anthony Homesick.  We're going to be talking to him again.  But we are playing your favorite opening Anthony Bits today.  If you got one, give us a call.  Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven or you can fax us to one two nine  five seven W.  A.W.  We're going to play another song from Steven Lynch.  He was in yesterday with a whole batch of brand new songs.  One of them got us a lot of trouble.  If you got the pre song, you got gold in your hand because you'll never hear that  again.  Every once in a while, you'll tune in our show and you'll hear something once. 
[13:00]
 That's one of those that you'll never hear again.  So you got a bootleg.  You got something special in your hands.  OK, one oh two seven W.  A.W.  The Wreck of New York, the latest from Collective Soul off their CD dosage.  That is a run.  You could also find that off the varsity blues soundtrack.  Those guys sounded great on Ralph Dottori show the other day.  I think they're coming to town soon.  We'll have some dates for you if you've never seen Collective Soul in concert.  Check him out.  They're very, very good.  It's hope be flying solo today.  Very strange.  I'm sitting here in the studio by myself. 
[13:30]
 Ralph Dottori was helping me out for a little while, but he went upstairs to take a  crunch.  Is he coming back?  We'll find out how his crunch was.  Come on, Ralph.  Come on, Ralph.  It doesn't even know we're talking about his crunch.  How was it?  Your crunch.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I got to tell you a story.  I got, you know, last night I was my my sister-in-law's birthday and she took us 
[14:00]
 all out for Mexican food for her birthday.  Happy belated birthday, Auntie.  And now I'm not a big fan of Mexican food for obvious reasons.  Yeah, you heard of a two flusher, right?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  No, go down the first time.  This was a three flusher.  You had the green apple splatters.  I figured out the funny part is we have the coed bathroom here on this level.  I went upstairs.  Well, you're relatively new to any W.  You know what that bathroom is all about right there, right?  The coed bathroom.  Yeah, no, I don't.  What?  You're not allowed to crunch in that bathroom. 
[14:30]
 Well, I never have.  OK, all right.  So my conscience is clear.  All right.  Because when Anthony and I had Willie Nelson in the imaginary ballroom, one of  like the tech guys, he crunched in that bathroom and the smell was brutal.  That's not fair.  So that that room is just for just kind of taking a quick leave.  But thinking up upstairs is OK.  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah, because that's a sales area.  Who cares about them?  Who else goes up in that in there?  Everybody wins.  Every day, everybody crunches upstairs.  You're not allowed to crunch in that bathroom. 
[15:00]
 I feel sorry for this tile falling off the wall.  I feel sorry for whoever goes in there next.  Really?  Right on, man.  All right, we're hanging.  We're doing like the best of both the Anthony today because Anthony's homesick.  We're going to get him on the phone a little bit.  It can be incoherent.  It's fun, though.  Mainline and night quilt.  Yeah, because every time we call him, he just gets more and more out of it.  It's kind of fun to just listen to him.  So on the way, we're going to play the Popeye bit talking about Pusky.  And I think I'm going to break one out from the archives.  Because the Super Bowl is around the corner. 
[15:30]
 We did a couple of Super Bowl pranks that are really funny.  That no one has ever heard.  We've got to give the people some new material.  Cool.  So we called a funeral parlor and said that someone in our family died and it was  their dream to watch the Super Bowl.  And, you know, we needed him to come over and prop the body up so you can watch the  game.  You've got to stick around and hear this.  I'll break one out of the archives that you're not going to believe.  All right.  But right now we're getting a lot of requests for our old bits and a bunch of calls for  the Mike Brady bit. 
[16:00]
 Did you hear the Mike Brady bit?  Refresh my memory.  OK. Anthony was convinced that Mike Brady spent a lot of his time under the stairs at  the Brady Bunch house because you can see right through the stairs.  No, I missed this.  So Anthony was convinced that Mike Brady was a dirty boy.  He's a dirty boy.  Just sounds like it.  So he thought, you know, he spent the time just looking at the girls go up and down  the stairs.  The Rock of New York, one of two seven W.  A. W.  Thin Lizzie jailbreak and the latest from Everlast before that.  What it's like from the city. 
[16:30]
 Whitey Ford sings the blues.  Ralph, have you heard the rest of that album yet?  Bits and pieces.  Yeah.  Is it as good as that song or it's a little more uptempo?  Is it?  Well, isn't he the lead singer of one of those?  Who is he the lead singer of?  Maybe one of our listeners can help us out like a hardcore metal band.  A thrash band.  Well, it's a flying solo.  My my buddy, my pal, my partner in crime is on the phone.  Anthony second home. 
[17:00]
 It's just wait a minute.  I got to take my little medicine.  You know, wait a minute.  House of Pain.  Oh, that's right.  That stuff is horrible.  What are you taking this hour?  More Robitussin.  Oh, yeah.  What?  The quills not working for you?  I can't take the quill till later.  Why?  I pass out.  Yeah, but the listeners want you to do the quill and then try and talk and then try to  do the show with me.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Maybe I'll do that for the next break. 
[17:30]
 Yeah.  I'll take some quill.  All right.  What's on TV?  Anything good?  Well, I was just watching CBS news.  They had a great call on tape of some cops beat the crap out of some guy.  That's always fun.  Yeah.  Other than that, boy, there is nothing on television.  This just sucks.  I got to get back in there.  Well, don't you have the cartoon network?  They play crap.  What do you mean?  Good cartoons.  Well, what cartoon they playing?  I don't know.  Some of that new stuff where like the whole body is stiff and just the mouth moves. 
[18:00]
 Oh, yeah.  That's lousy animation.  Not the best animation in the world.  Oh, it's terrible.  Well, Anthony, I got the Popeye bid all cute up here.  Oh, this is what started you down to the road to sickness.  I believe you think this is what ruined my throat.  Yeah.  Cause you hint to that in the middle of this Popeye thing.  I was feeling a little scratchy that day.  Yes.  Well, it all started when I asked Popeye if he was a member of the Tuesday, Tuesday  night Hummer club.  Right.  And Popeye went off. 
[18:30]
 I guess pretty good.  I mean,  and blue dough isn't in it.  You know, it's got married.  Now, blue doesn't get any.  Yes.  She was the only whoring town.  What does olive and a submarine have in common?  What Popeye?  They're both full of semen.  A troliversity, it connected. 
[19:00]
 I tell people.  We're done.  They're both.  Then did the.  Totally not.  Being able to be there.  Oh,  no,  be.  Oh me gosh. 
[19:30]
 You ain't never seen a Pusky like the one on Olypsk.  I told you many times you can't say Pusky on the radio.  I'll say Pusky whenever I want to say Pusky.  Pusky.  It looks like the sea hag.  Oh, Olypsk, Olypsk, eat a burger for Christ's sake. 
[20:00]
 Use a bag's of bones.  Oh, Olypsk, I can't even grab your ass.  Oh, you ain't gots a mask.  Oh, Olypsk, how about a little hygiene?  Oh, I'm a sailor man.  I know what low tide smells like.  Something ends donating from the Pusky.  Where's Wimpy? 
[20:30]
 Oh yeah, you think Wimpy's a homo, right?  Wimpy the Flameskin home go sexual.  Always looking for free meat.  That's right. 
[21:00]
 Well, I guess Popeye is a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[21:30]
 Of course.  That's something everyone wanted to know today.  But I have to reciprocate.  Sometimes I burn Olypsk Pusky with my pipe.  Because I never taste it out of me mouth.  Why do you think that one eye pops out?  It's the fumes. 
[22:00]
 Olypsk does a great trick with our Pusky.  Yeah, what is that?  Watch, watch, come here, Olypsk.  Let me take me pipes out of me mouth.  Put it here, down by the Pusky.  Okay, go, Olypsk.  Look, she blows the pipe.  It's a magical Pusky.  I can't see that word on the radio, man.  Pusky, Pusky, Pusky.  Come on, get, get, get, get. 
[22:30]
 I never hate a rule against the word Pusky.  Wow, all right.  All right.  Well, I guess we got the answer to our question. 
[23:00]
 Oh, yeah.  I'm a Chatska member.  There you have it from Tuesday night, man.  Anthony, you still there?  Oh, Anthony.  Anthony, you still there?  Yeah.  There's a piece of you in your better days, man.  All right.  We'll check in with you at 6, right?  You do that.  A little after 6?  All right, man.  All right, I hope you feel better. 
[23:30]
 So do I.  Okay.  All right.  Later, bro.  Later.  On the way, we got James Addiction, The Who, the new band Indigenous, and we got the answer  to our question.  The lead singer of Everlast was from House of Pain.  That's right.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.E.W. with The Who and the band Indigenous before that,  Now That You're Gone.  It's Opie flying solo today.  Not feeling that great myself, but I'm feeling much better than Anthony.  If you've been listening to the radio, he's very sick at home.  I think you started this sickness, Ralph. 
[24:00]
 Ralph, the tour is sitting here today helping us out.  That was somewhere in the middle.  I still got it, actually.  Well, someone started the sickness around here.  You're blaming Carol?  Well, Carol's been out for three or four days now.  Matt Devotee's been sick.  You had it for a while.  Anthony's got it.  Roger in Marketing's got it.  We're running around disinfecting the studio all the time.  Well, look what I brought in here.  I got Lysol.  I feel like Howard Hughes, man.  I got my hand soap.  The antibacterial stuff that just kind of disappears.  Yep.  And I got the heavy-duty Lysol.  Put it in the mic. 
[24:30]
 No, put it in the mic.  Let him spray it.  Don't spray me.  I'm spraying it at you, man.  What?  It's nasty.  Yeah, but it's going to keep us healthy, hopefully.  It's going to keep the germs out of here.  It's spray so much I can taste it.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's funny.  Anthony usually sits over there.  And we said this earlier.  We got his whole microphone set up.  And if you ever saw the Leonard Skinner tribute show, everyone saw that, right?  We're just in the spotlight.  Yeah.  Now, what was the brother?  What was his name again?  Not the one that died, the one that took over for Johnny Van Zandt. 
[25:00]
 Johnny Van Zandt took over.  For Ronnie Van Zandt.  For Ronnie, right.  Well, Johnny sings all the Leonard Skinner songs, every single one of them, except one.  And then at the end of the show, they say there's only one guy that can sing this next  song, and he's no longer with us.  They do Free Bird.  And they do Free Bird instrumentally.  And they have a spotlight on the mic stand, and they just do an instrumental version of  the song.  You get goosebumps.  First time I saw that, it freaked me out.  Anyway, with that said, that's what we got happening over here with Anthony's microphone. 
[25:30]
 We got a cheap laptop set up because Anthony brought his home.  We got his microphone with a Sam Adams hat just kind of draped over the microphone and  a spotlight just waiting for his return, which might be tomorrow.  He's just sick.  He's not gone.  No, he's not gone.  Come on.  No, but you know.  Set up that image.  No, no, he's not gone.  I just hope I'm in here tomorrow with him.  That'll be funny.  I'll be sick tomorrow and he'll be here.  So, I think.  The lunch was in yesterday once again.  And if you got a copy of the pre-song, consider yourself lucky because we can't play that 
[26:00]
 ever, ever, ever again.  There's about 10 bits we've done here in New York that we can never, ever, ever play again.  And that's one of them.  So if you got a copy, you know, consider yourself special.  But I think we're allowed to play this one again.  The Kitten Song.  Which one is it?  He sang a song about kittens?  Yeah, cute little ditty about kittens.  Is it anti-cats?  Oh, I don't think so.  Because I'm not a big fan.  No, I self.  I personally, I think Stephen Lynch loves cats.  Ralph. 
[26:30]
 Okay.  You can tell by this song.  Oh, it's here.  All right.  Also on the way, we're going to break out a bit from the archives that you've never,  ever heard.  All right.  It's a Super Bowl prank we did because we're giving away that trip to the Super Bowl.  Mm-hmm.  Starting tomorrow.  It's unbelievable.  1027WNW, the Rock of New York, Billy Idol, White Wedding.  And the wedding singer making Billy Idol pretty huge these days.  Had that fine cameo on the airplane with Adam Sandler.  So be it.  He helped him.  Who?  Quadraphenia. 
[27:00]
 Quadraphenia, that's right.  What is he doing with Quadraphenia?  He was the bellboy.  The bellboy, that's right.  Bellboy.  Yeah, Ralph Dutour in the studio helping me out.  Anthony, I'm having a fun time.  Homesick.  It's cool.  I feel like it's Bring Your Kid to Work Day and I'm the kid.  You're supervising me.  You're making sure I don't cross the line today.  No, I think you're taking care of that yourself.  We're doing okay.  I think the yesterday.  Yeah, yesterday.  Yikes.  I think that's why he's pretending he's sick.  Anthony? 
[27:30]
 Yeah, he's scared to come in.  Well, I told Anthony earlier when I talked to him at 320 that he picked a perfect day  not to come in today because the boss, Gary, had a stack of messages from people that were  complaining about yesterday's show.  So I had to take the heat by myself today.  It wasn't fun.  I feel sorry for you.  Well, the boss had to spend two, two and a half hours just calling back all these people  that complained about our show yesterday.  You didn't know.  Well, Stephen Lynch was in and he he'd sung a song about a priest. 
[28:00]
 A nasty song.  That is going to get a lot of people in a lot of trouble.  Yikes.  I think we survived this one.  All right.  Well, we got the Super Bowl trip.  We're going to start doing that tomorrow, Ralph.  Absolutely.  We don't know exactly when when the winning starts.  It's not on my little sheet here, but all weekend long.  You got that chance to win the trip to go to Miami for the Super Bowl and you qualify  by winning a Sony Web TV courtesy of the Bud Bowl.  Yeah, that's pretty neat.  And then you got your chance to go to the game.  What was Anthony talking about yesterday with this whole modem thing? 
[28:30]
 He's got the cable modem.  The cable modem.  Yeah, that's not for Web TV.  That's for an actual just regular computer, right?  I get it.  Be faster.  I believe you thought you could use the cable modem for both your TV and the Web TV and  the computer.  I got to admit, I don't know what it's all about.  So you don't know what a cable modem is all about.  No, I don't.  Seriously?  No, seriously.  Well, do you have the Internet at home?  You don't have a computer at home Ralph.  It's 1999.  You know what the deal is?  I had I have one of the original. 
[29:00]
 I have a 386 which is a doorstop.  No, you know, I bought a computer whatever 10 years ago.  Yeah, and never updated.  You got to get into the 90s.  Yeah.  No, it's a joke.  It is a cable modem.  I mean you use the computers around here and you want to go.  I mean, I'm computer savvy.  All right.  So when I here's the deal when you go to a website, all right with the student, you know,  the station computers it takes for a while for your page to load, right?  Especially Pedro out of here.  This one is exactly.  So you go to the W&W website and you have to wait for the home page to pop up with a 
[29:30]
 cable cable modem.  It's instant.  I like that you want to you know, gratification.  Yeah, you type in an address and poof it's there.  It is so fast.  It's a beautiful thing.  We're going to get them here.  Well, we available you have to wait.  What's the deal?  The funny thing is we got the t1 lines here and the t1 lines are really really fast, but  the cable modem makes the t1 lines look silly and that's just the you know, the way of the  future right there.  I'll just get it all at once.  You should.  Yeah, they'll come with over drive a big truck to the house and just and set yourself up. 
[30:00]
 Be ready and then you'll never see me again.  All right.  So we got the trip for the Super Bowl all weekend long.  You get a chance to qualify by winning the Sony Web TV courtesy of the Bud Bowl and then  I believe if it works like other things we've done around here.  Steve Mason on Monday will take all the weekend winners and pick a grand prize winner.  The winner in the Bud Bowl this year.  Who cares?  Who cares?  That is so good.  The give us a little bit.  He's the guy who cares.  I have a light but Anthony loves Bud.  I love Bud.  I like Bud drive.  They don't make it. 
[30:30]
 I didn't even know they were doing the Bud Bowl this year.  They are.  They always do.  You know, they're doing a seven hour pregame for the Super Bowl this year.  Why I don't know last year was two hours and 40 minutes this year.  It's seven hours long.  Who does it?  They are Clinton.  Exactly.  How does this be?  Just don't even get me started with that.  Okay.  But speaking of the Super Bowl, I broke out a bit from the opium Anthony archives.  What oh two seven W any W the Rock of New York with train.  That's a song called free.  It's Opie hang with Ralph the tour today.  Anthony taking a sick day.  I know he'll hopefully be back with the Mwah tomorrow for FU Friday. 
[31:00]
 Yeah, it has like a southern feel to it.  Right?  Absolutely.  Sounds like Marshall Tucker a little bit.  Yeah, just a tiny bit.  Same thing the first time I heard it, but they're from Frisco.  They're from Frisco.  Yeah, from Frisco.  They sound like they should be from down South.  Well, there's a system Southern Fried Rock vocalist is yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  We got to find out more.  We'll get him here.  But bring the town you you had collective soul this week.  That was fun.  Those guys are really really very shy.  Yeah, I warned you.  Did I shine and I warned you like so Ed blah blah blah blah blah blah. 
[31:30]
 Yeah, the lead singer doesn't like to really toss.  That's true.  He doesn't have an attitude though.  He's just he just is really shy.  That's the an interview is nightmare.  I guess it no answers.  That's why not come on dog.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you sit there and you have a question.  Yeah, and you do your research and you ask that some nice questions and you get yeah,  I guess I just look good.  Yeah.  Okay, what's their touring plans collective soul because I really like those guys a lot more.  I think March.  He said March 6.  They're playing somewhere in either Canada or New England. 
[32:00]
 But when are they going to be down in New York?  They don't know.  This is sometime before the end of the year.  I'll be playing New York.  All right.  So that's pretty big space.  Cool.  Well, I want to thank Ralph for hanging with me today.  It's my pleasure because I used to do radio by myself and it kind of got a long time ago.  That was a long time ago.  I haven't done solo radio in four years and now I don't know how people do it.  I don't know how Ralph you sit here.  You're on from 12 to 3.  Yeah, you sit here.  You stare at that wall and you act like hardly stare at the wall. 
[32:30]
 You know what I mean?  You're looking around and you're getting your show together.  But you're feeding the fantasy that everybody thinks a DJ just sits around and plays me.  Now Ralph works with music.  You know, yeah, I'll sit around, you know, read the paper.  But what I'm trying to explain to the walls to the people listening right now,  it's not easy just to be in a room by yourself with a microphone on and talk to imaginary people.  See when Anthony and I do the show we could interact with each other.  Yeah, but when you're a jock by yourself in a room, it's kind of strange.  You don't know who you're really talking to.  Absolutely. 
[33:00]
 You don't have that feedback and you can't play off anybody is nobody to play off of and that's why I begged you to stay with me today.  Because I just can't imagine doing it.  It has been too long.  Yeah, you know, this is fun for me too.  Cool.  And you're helping me out with my music knowledge, which is pretty good, which I need help on.  Especially these these bands like tree.  But we've been asking everyone to call in with their favorite opiate Anthony bits taking a trip down memory lane today.  And we had a bunch of calls for some of the telemarketer calls.  We've done in the past. 
[33:30]
 What are these?  Did you listen to our show Ralph occasionally?  I feel like we shouldn't even be playing these bits because we played them so much.  But now that I've missed quite a few, I'm sure obviously well at home.  I'm very bored before the show and the telemarketers.  We all hate telemarketers, right?  They call it the wrong time.  You're trying to usually during dinner usually during dinner or whatever just at the worst time you can't get them off the phone and you beg to beg to get off their list and they keep, you know, harassing you.  So I turn the tide and I mess with them now and I record them at home. 
[34:00]
 Yeah, yeah, the Rock of New York 1027 W.  N.E.W.  Allman Brothers Statesboro Blues and N.E.W.  proudly presents the Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon March 4th.  Yeah, and 11th in addition, N.E.W.  presents Johnny Lang at the Hammerstein Ballroom March 10th.  We got to get him into the imaginary ballroom once again.  You know, it's a good thing you didn't become a musician.  What?  By the way, Anthony makes fun of that all the time.  I know drumming.  What was that?  I used to be a drummer.  Corky on drums, man.  I was drumming along pretty well.  You should hear me sing. 
[34:30]
 Oh God, no.  Anthony's trying to record me singing because when the songs are playing,  I just start screaming and singing along thinking I sound good.  You should see everyone's faces in here.  I can imagine.  It's like when you blow the dog whistle and the dog's head kind of turned sideways  and stuff.  That's the face Anthony makes as I'm singing.  I'm like, what?  I'm just singing along.  I'm having fun here.  Oh, we got Anthony on the line.  He's on the line.  Is he totally nonsensical here?  Anthony.  Hey.  What's up?  Uh, 
[35:00]
 kicking in, huh?  Is it kicking in?  It's like,  yeah, it's like,  he's there.  We think the quill.  I'm very fuzzy.  Oh, you took the quill right about now.  It's like the night.  Well, okay.  Have you eaten anything today other than liquid medicine?  No, that's it.  Just drugs.  Over-the-counter drugs, man.  You combine these things, right?  You don't need crack.  It's great.  You just got to get the right form.  The formula.  Now, what is the right formula? 
[35:30]
 You need a couple of Theraflu tablets.  Okay.  And then you need some Robitussin.  Two jiggers of Robitussin.  Two shots.  Yeah, two shots.  Shot of quill.  Okay.  And some Eccedra.  And then put a little Jack in it and you're set.  Oh, yeah.  So what have you been doing?  I'm watching a lot of television.  And there's nothing on, right?  Yeah, I got to say the Nintendo Battle Tanks commercial with these 
[36:00]
 goof on the snuggles the bear thing.  Yeah, it's hysterical.  Did you happen to catch that?  You probably find everything hysterical at this point.  Yeah, everything is kind of funny.  Yeah.  How many times have you seen that commercial?  I'm not my father's daughter.  That movie Elizabeth or whatever.  I'm sick of that commercial.  Speaking of movie, too.  There's a movie coming out.  I just saw the ad for it today.  Yeah.  With Juliet Lewis.  Yeah.  Called the other sister.  She's a retard. 
[36:30]
 Marrying a guy retard.  And it's the whole thing with the parents wondering if they should  get married.  And there's like retard sex.  It looks like a scurrying.  I was roaring just at the at the after-time report.  Oh, that's classy.  And then the boy, they're doing this typical voice.  Have I got bad bad bad.  I was dying.  They totally were doing that.  Wait till you see this commercial.  You'll die laughing.  I haven't seen the commercial yet.  It's great.  It must be really fun funny under the influence of Quill to everything. 
[37:00]
 And I was watching some kind of wonderful that movie with Jennifer  Connelly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's a dirty girl.  I was gonna say you'd be the dirty boy.  And yeah, that's about it.  Other than that, I'm sitting here fever.  You get fever sack.  You know, fever sack.  Fever sack.  Fever sack.  Yeah, like like your whole body's hot.  So it does everything it can to cool down. 
[37:30]
 Yeah, like you stack you like Turkish taffy.  You got no drive, right?  No, I'm done.  You're done skiing.  I'm done.  It looks like I'm going solo tomorrow as well.  I'll say come on be a trooper.  Come on.  Yeah, you should see what the listeners are writing about you.  Sorry.  Are they cruel?  Yeah, they're real cruel.  Bastard.  That's that's okay.  I'll get them all back.  That's right.  So that's okay.  We're fair game just like everything else.  That's how it works. 
[38:00]
 How's the controversy with the song?  On the pre-song snicker in the background.  Why you laughing?  Dude, it's not looking good for the boys.  No laughing.  What's the deal?  I think the Cardinals involved the Cardinals.  Yeah, the baseball team the football team.  The Cardinals.  What?  Leave it there.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, we got to thank Stephen Lynch for getting us in trouble.  Feel like we weren't doing a good enough job by ourselves.  I know.  We need Stephen Lynch to help us.  Yeah, he had to push us. 
[38:30]
 He had to push us right over the edge, man.  He is the anti-Christ.  Yes.  We had nothing to do with that song yesterday.  Oh, of course not.  We just came before him and broadcasted to a million people.  The best line yesterday, Anthony, after he did the pre-song and it was obvious that we were going to hell.  Yeah.  You go in the air.  You come on the air and go,  The O.P. and Anthony show has been removed from the airwaves.  It could be a prophecy.  Yeah, it couldn't be the first time, right, bro?  All right, well, get better. 
[39:00]
 I wasn't even going to call you this hour.  I figured we'd let you slide, but...  Well, I was getting a little pumped.  I'm listening.  I'm getting it out.  Oh, yeah, like we're just rocking without you.  I'm still there.  It's just a different show without you, man.  And I switched back because I was listening to Rocky Allen.  One of his last shows.  Is he doing knuckleheads in the news today, Anthony?  I wasn't listening to that.  I'm really kidding.  All right, man.  All righty.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Hasta mañana. 
[39:30]
 For as you Friday.  Thanks for hanging around.  My pleasure.  Feel better, man.  Is he the man or what, bro?  What?  He's the man, right?  He is.  All right, cool.  Kick that.  All right, I'll talk to you.  There's our pal, Anthony.  He just sounds like crap.  Yeah, if he got a fever, stay home.  Yeah, so just reinfect everybody.  We'll go around the cycle again.  Well, Gary got mad at me because I said, I come in, I go, Anthony is just...  He's not happening.  This is the first time Anthony's been sick in four and a half years of us working together.  And I said, and I don't feel good either.  I got a fever. 
[40:00]
 My eyeballs feel like they're going to pop out.  You know that when you get the eyeballs burning and stuff, and he goes, Dean, what are you doing here?  We would have been Tony Pig on the air.  Right.  I don't know why they want to come in.  Yeah, I said, I'd want to come in, man.  We're troopers.  We don't have a life when we're not on the radio.  So this is much better than staying home sick.
