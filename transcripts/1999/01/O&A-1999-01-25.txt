 I'm so high.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Pink Floyd.  Days anew before that, Touch, Appeal and Stan and ACDC2.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  How you doing?  Well, I've got to ask one question right off the bat.  Did we bomb anyone?  Did anything important happen this weekend?  I don't think so.  No, not really.  Why?  Anyone famous?  TV or anything?  Anyone famous die?  We didn't nuke anyone?  Nothing, right? 
[00:30]
 False alarm on Joe DiMaggio.  Which we'll get into later.  No.  Okay.  I didn't watch TV at all this weekend.  And I felt very strange coming into NEW today, not being informed with what's going on around  me.  Well, then I guess you were doing something very important that you don't know what happened  over the weekend.  I was playing PlayStation.  I'm addicted.  Tomb Raider 3, right?  Tomb Raider 3 is what's getting me these days.  All right.  But you know, I woke up yesterday.  You're a rip, man.  Well, I woke up yesterday and it looked like seven outside. 
[01:00]
 We discussed it on Friday.  It was one of those seven weekends, just dreary and rainy.  It was a perfect day to just stay on the couch for eight straight hours and play Tomb Raider  3.  Eight hours.  Eight hours.  Oh, I'm proud.  Look at that.  I played a total of 14 hours this weekend.  Tomb Raider 3.  You finally found a game that you can stay on there for hours with.  Yeah, but the problem is, the problem is I need to rent a 12 year old kid to come out  and come over.  Michael Jackson. 
[01:30]
 No, I need to rent a 12 year old kid to come over and do the maneuvers for me on the waterfall  ice cliffs, waterfall cliffs.  What's the matter, Grandpa?  You can't swing the move?  I understand what I have to do.  And I tried to do it for four straight hours.  Four straight hours.  Saturday night.  To do, wait, to just do one little thing?  Yeah.  Oh my gosh.  And I know exactly what I have to do.  I need some 12 year old kid out there to come to my house after the show. 
[02:00]
 This is how desperate I am.  I'll go pick you up.  I'll bring you home.  You get me through that section so I can move on with the game.  It's pathetic.  You are pathetic.  Well, the part I'm stuck at, you climb up the cliff.  You have to do a double back flip onto another cliff.  Then you have to jump completely across the cavern to a ledge.  You got to hit the jump perfectly.  What is it with Lara that she has to do back flips to jump? 
[02:30]
 She looks cool doing it.  But I mean, why not just jump?  Well, no, because you're facing backwards.  You can't turn around when you're on a ladder, dude.  I'm almost positive you can't, anyway.  So then you make that jump.  Then you climb.  You have to make another jump where you have to turn in midair to the left and land on  like a dime.  Then the final jump is across the cavern again where a cobra snake is waiting for you.  So I finally make it up there. 
[03:00]
 I'm like, cool.  I take out my guns to kill the cobra.  Damn thing bites me once and kicks me down to the bottom of the cavern.  Got to start all over.  So that's where you spent four straight hours.  Hi, NAW.  Hi, guys.  The reason why he can't do it is because he's too busy checking out the chick's butt.  That's a hot little video game.  It really is.  She is smoking.  That's why you're not making the moves, man.  Take your eye off the body for a few minutes.  You'll figure it out.  Well, every once in a while, they'll show you a shot of Lara Croft's just breasts. 
[03:30]
 Like your whole TV is her animated breasts.  I'm like, wait a minute.  That's great.  I'll turn on the Playboy channel if I want to see that.  I'm trying to play a game here.  I know, man.  You just get totally into it.  Next thing you know, it's like, oh, freak, I'm dead.  So we start again.  I'm like, what?  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.

Well, we'll talk to them next. 
[06:30]
 All right.  Make a way, right?  All right.  Rick is screening the calls right now.  212-757-1027.  Remember that number because later this hour when you hear Stone Free by Hendrix, be the  tenth caller.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York, Metallica.  Turn the page.  And Hendrix before that, that's the song you had to be listening for to qualify for that  Super Bowl party in your house.  And John Lemezuz.  Wow.  Wow.  He is Polish. 
[07:00]
 You're right.  John Lemezuzki of Whitestone, New York.  Congratulations, John.  You're our latest qualifier.  That is quite an honor.  Congratulations.  All right.  Next hour.  Next hour, I think to qualify someone, we're going to play Godfather Trivia.  All right.  We could do it a little different than everyone else's, right?  Is there any set rules that we have to make the listeners, uh, feel comfortable?  No.  I think we should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  We should do it.  All right.  So we'll let the listeners, uh, wait for a song.  That's our show, right?  I think we should do Godfather Trivia because Anthony claims to, to know that the one and 
[07:30]
 two Godfather one and two.  You don't get me into three.  I want to get started.  Damn cult bull should have left it alone for God's sake.  You think you'll do well with Trivia from one and two?  Yeah, from one and two.  I mean, they begin to two.  It's left off very nicely.  Michael sitting on the bench realizing, you know, he did everything for the family and  in turn there wasn't much family left. You know and he's just reflecting. Leave it like 
[08:00]
 that. Get into the whole thing later on with the three with his diabetes or whatever and  this and that. Killing the Pope. I don't want to hear it.  You think you'll do well with the tribute from one and two. First person that stumps  Anthony will qualify.  Yeah I think so.  And will qualify for what you ask?  Well you'll win the fifty dollar multi-sport passport to Chelsea Pierce and qualify to  have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house. Okay?  Alright.  We'll do that next hour so get your godfather trivia together. Now Anthony I saw the blockbuster 
[08:30]
 videos in your car. You rented Lethal Weapon 4?  It was mindless Sunday video day.  How bad was it because I never saw it.  Yeah that franchise has been done for a couple of episodes already.  Was Chris Rock funny at least?  I don't know. I've seen Chris Rock very funny.  Yeah.  And this wasn't the funny Chris Rock. No.  How bad was it?  Very formulaic. Very stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah. The chinks were the bad guys in this one.  Oh. Something a little different. 
[09:00]
 Something a little different. At one point though they're arresting some guy that ran  out of a restaurant and they think he's a bad guy and he turns out to be a cook and  they ask him to prove it and he goes well what's the special today? And the guy goes  well I'm fine Paul.  I started laughing.  Hey wait a minute look at that. Hey it's Yochi everyone.  Yochi's in the movie.  Okay.  And then you had what else was in the car?  Oh Mafia.  Mafia.  Abrams movie about the. 
[09:30]
 Who was that Lloyd Bridges?  Yeah his last movie. Boy I'm sure he was happy about that.  To leave us with that mess?  Yeah you know mindless silly. It was funny when it was airplane and police squad but  you know that whole thing is done too.  They didn't pull it off.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sometimes you got to rent the bad movies. At least I rented them. I didn't go out to  see them. What movie did OPC this weekend?  Well where'd you go? Come on.  Alright listen though after playing Tomb Raiders 3 for 14 hours this weekend. 
[10:00]
 14 hours.  I had to give a little back.  Right because the girls get a little angry when you spend so much time.  I had to give a little back and it wasn't like we were going to go see some cool war  movie.  Alright you aren't going to see Thin Rent and Thin Red Line or anything.  You've got mail.  What what excuse me?  You've got mail.  You've got mail. Is that what you said?  Yeah.  You went and saw You've Got Mail. I paid to see You've Got Mail.  You're a pussy man. 
[10:30]
 Oh you really had to pay back for a plane.  This movie.  Yeah this movie I mean it's been said many times but it's just the cheap version of Sleepless  in Seattle as we all know.  How many guys are in there with you?  None.  None? You were like the only guy.  Yeah Sandy, my sister, my cousin Michelle.  It's the same audience.  Oh you mean in the whole theater?  Yeah.  There was a couple of other saps. 
[11:00]
 Poor saps.  Yeah but there's a few interesting things about You've Got Mail.  First being it's a huge commercial for AOL.  Right.  It's huge.  AOL is all over this movie and Meg Ryan is signing on to her account on AOL.  Right.  Guess how long it takes in the movie?  How long?  Five seconds.  Ah come on.  So she signs on and it goes You've Got Mail.  The whole place starts laughing.  It wasn't supposed to be a joke there but everyone's laughing because it's like yeah right it  does take me five seconds to sign on to AOL. 
[11:30]
 Of course not.  Everyone knows the drill.  I'm sorry all circuits are busy.  Please try again.  Yeah right after work she's signing on to get her mail.  Yeah that's not a busy time at all.  No.  You don't get a busy signal whatsoever when you sign on at that point.  All circuits are busy.  Please try again.  Yeah and then at one point in the movie she signs on and it doesn't say You've Got Mail  it says No Mail.  And then everyone starts laughing again because when was the last time you saw that? 
[12:00]
 You had No Mail on AOL?  Right.  With all the spams and the mail for the smut sites and stuff you get mail every day now.  Yeah everyone wants me to invest in the market and I love smut.  My email on my AOL account that's all it is.  Hot horse at your beck and call.  Wow invest in Amazon.com.  Wow look at that right next to each other.  Well the thing I hate now you bring up all your mail they trick you into opening up the 
[12:30]
 mail.  What's that about?  Oh you don't fall for that.  I fall every once in a while.  It says hey I'm writing you back man.  Yeah yeah yeah I'm writing you back and you're like writing me back.  What is this?  Teen sluts with Bob Ross.  Ah they got you.  They got me alright.  I don't fall for that.  And the other thing real fast about You've Got Mail they conveniently made New York look  like a place that had no foreigners.  Just a nice clean very white city. 
[13:00]
 Really?  You've Got Mail.  And there supposedly takes place on the west side in the 70s.  Oh there's really not much traffic up there is there Anthony?  I don't know.  Yeah they're walking around the streets and you see just a couple cars going by.  And no foreigners whatsoever just all white people.  So it's the movies.  Well obviously.  I mean this is a great place to live and work but come on.  So they made it look a little different in the movie theater.  So what pussy movie do you like best?  This one or Bridges of Madison County or Fried Green Tomatoes. 
[13:30]
 Which one that you got?  Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.  You want to get into this.  The Bridges of Madison County.  I never went to see Fried Green Tomatoes in the theater.  Oh wow.  And I never saw it at home.  Maybe like five minutes at a time.  Steel Magnolias.  Oh my god you saw Bridges of Madison County.  Yeah I did.  In the movies.  Shut up man.  I sat there and was pissed off like every other guy in the theater. 
[14:00]
 Oh and Clint takes his shirt off.  That was my favorite part Anthony.  You ass.  What an ass.  It was early on in my relationship.  You have to do things like that to get a little of the.  Meryl Streep's looking out the window at Clint Eastwood who looks like he's eight billion  years old with his shirt off.  His skin is hanging like doilies.  And there she is looking out the window.  It's starting to caress her bloated body. 
[14:30]
 My god.  Maybe 20 years ago kids.  What are you doing here?  You're so right.  You are so right.  Hi NDAW.  Boys on the side.  NDAW shut up.  Hey guys how are you doing?  Hey man what's up?  First of all Anthony welcome back from your sickness.  Thank you.  I'm feeling much better.  Great.  Second of all how could you not think that Legal Weapon 4 was a good movie? 
[15:00]
 It was just done already.  The nitricine?  The nitricine made the movie.  That stuff is so contrived too when they do it.  I don't know.  It's a whole palsy walsy thing.  They are in the dentist office and they are all breathing nitricine and they are laughing  and making jokes.  It wasn't that good.  It wasn't that good.  The sensational explosions.  They are not that sensational anymore.  We've all seen them.  Right.  Second of all I can kind of feel what Opus is doing. 
[15:30]
 A couple of years ago when that Greg Kinnear movie came out with Warren Harley I was dragged  to the movies.  The last couple of movies that we saw before that was I Know What You Did Last Summer and  I did drag it to that one.  She was like, well I saw your movie and now you've got to come see me.  Who is that?  Jackie Martling you know?  Oh, hey. 
[16:00]
 I had to go to the movies.  Thank you.  I can't talk about sucking.  You've got to word it right.  You've got to code it right.  We get the point.  Every guy has had their girl drag him to a movie because they turn around and say, hey,  I saw your movie.  Well my movies are more entertaining.  They've got a little bit of everything.  There are just not a lot of movies that are made for both sexes.  The Horse Whisperer. 
[16:30]
 Oh my God if I was ever going to get dragged to that piece of trash.  Alright, more to come.  Give us a call or send us a fax.  212-957-WNEW.  And our instant feedback has been moved I believe if you're trying to find that today  Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  You just click on our pictures and scroll down the page.  And you'll be able to find it from there?  Yeah, you'll find it.  Okay.  The Rock of New York 1027-WNEW Celebrity Skin from Hole. 
[17:00]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  As we head into the second hour of the program today, we're setting up here for Godfather  Trivia.  Anthony is the master of film and TV trivia.  I don't think I'm the master Opie.  I just think I watch a lot of television, seen a lot of movies.  Godfather is one of my favorites.  Let's just see what happens.  I'm not making any promises.  You might get burned the first question.  Yeah.  It's a chance you're going to take.  It's a chance I'll take.  I'm not saying I'm an expert. 
[17:30]
 I'm just taking a little test here.  So you'll accept questions from Godfather One and Two?  Yes.  No.  Three out of it.  I'm just not a fan of Godfather Three.  Wow, Francis Ford Coppola.  Take your money and leave with One and Two.  The biggest joke of that movie was his daughter being in it.  What a joke.  Worst actor in the history of Hollywood.  What a joke.  And the likes of a trilogy of a story with such great characters and actors and actresses  and he puts that hat in because it's his daughter? 
[18:00]
 Yeah.  Alright, well here's the deal.  first person that stumps Anthony with Godfather Trivia will win a $50 multi-sport passport  to Chelsea Piers and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house this coming  Sunday.  And you heard about this, right?  Yeah.  You and I are going to be watching the Super Bowl with somebody.  It better be Cole.  And we're bringing a Sony 53-inch big screen projection television.  Hell, wow.  If we've got to break your house up because you're an a-hole, we're going to be pissed. 
[18:30]
 They've got a two-tuner picture in picture.  That's a great feature.  Wow, was that?  A two-tuner picture in picture.  That's TV.  Oh, so you don't need a separate VCR or something when you're hooking it up?  I got tricked into that.  Oh, wow.  Picture in picture.  Then you're like, wait a minute.  I need two VCRs to work.  I need two tuners.  What a pain in the ass.  The Rock of New York, 1027W&W, The Rolling Stones.  Good afternoon, it's Ophi and Anthony.  Hello.  Very, very busy day.  Talking about a lot of different things today on the show.  Yeah.  A bunch of people calling in with their comments about you've got man. 
[19:00]
 We'll get that on the radio in a little while.  Also, a lot of people.  Right, green tomatoes.  Yeah, a lot of people calling in and talking about the movies they've been dragged to in  the past.  Just to get some.  Terms of Endearment.  The Horse Whisperer.  The Horse Whisperer.  Oh, my God.  I got dragged to The Electric Horseman back in the late 70s, I guess, 79, whenever that  came out by a girl.  Now, was that the worst movie you were dragged to, you think?  No, no, there have been some bad ones. 
[19:30]
 But I got dragged to that one because I think it was out at the same time as The Wrath of  Khan came out.  And I took her to see The Wrath of Khan, so she was like, now you have to go see one of  my movies.  Like, oh, how could this compete?  Khan and Kirk, they're shooting phases at each other.  And oh, Ryle, Love Story.  That's awesome.  Did he get some at least for taking her?  Well, yeah.  It was the same girl that was hounding me because I was laughing at the TV movie Bill. 
[20:00]
 Oh, really?  Same one, huh?  Yeah, Lisa.  Part of your past.  Well, the worst movie for me, I was trying to think if there was anything worse than  Bridges of Madison County.  And you know, I just can't think of one.  No, huh?  That's got to be the worst one.  That was the worst movie I've been dragged to.  God, that was awful.  There wasn't one minute of action in that whole movie.  You know, if you're a guy and you're in that theater and you're looking at that screen  and you're enjoying yourself, I'd better not say anything. 
[20:30]
 Don't say you'd have to be a homo.  That would be inappropriate.  I mean, come on.  Call me close-minded, but I have to be.  I don't know any guy that enjoyed that.  You have to buy the stick, I think.  Because I just don't understand.  Right.  Especially like you were saying earlier with the Clint Eastwood naked and Meryl Streep  staring out the window, getting all horned up.  Who wants to see that?  Yeah, yeah.  Clint's pumping the water with his shirt off and she's up at the window like, just rubbing 
[21:00]
 her big body.  You're a dirty boy.  Yeah, look at him pumping this water.  Yeah, I'll be pumping something else, Meryl.  You're filthy, dirty looking out that window.  Clint Eastwood's got baloney tits.  I was in the theater and I had my arms folded and I turned to my right and there was another  poor sap with his arms folded going, oh, you got dragged to this mess too, huh?  What's the mess?  The same guy that was in the Outlaw Josie Wales, one of the best Westerns ever made. 
[21:30]
 And there he is, Bridges of Madison County, getting emasculated, getting a little water.  I've got to take more pictures of some bridges.  Whoa, the action doesn't stop here, does it?  Wow.  You know, I would love to hear from the ladies today.  Yeah, we should turn the coin on this one.  Ladies, what movie were you dragged to that you hated?  Oh, that the guys that made the girls go through.  I would love to hear what the ladies say to that one. 
[22:00]
 I don't know.  All right.  Because I could go to Titanic.  I saw that.  The girls loved Titanic because of the story in Leonardo Bummel.  But it was cool.  I mean, the effects were great.  It was interesting to watch.  Yeah, I honestly did not mind the Titanic.  It got a little sappy at the end.  But then when you get like Bridges of Madison County,  Steel Magnolias.  Now one guy takes it to the head with a yeah.  Boys on the side.  I'm going to see boys on the side. 
[22:30]
 Ah.  All right.  I think we're set for Godfather trivia, Anthony.  All right.  Let's see how this works.  Wasted a little time there, but that's okay.  Give us a call right now.  212-757-1027.  We are trying to stump Anthony this afternoon.  Yeah.  The king of trivia.  We are looking for your Godfather one and Godfather two trivia questions.  I'll slip in no three.  Anthony doesn't want anything to do with Godfather three.  I'm disassociating myself with Godfather three.  Okay.  Now here's the deal. 
[23:00]
 First person to stump Anthony will win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and qualify  to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house with that Sony 53 inch TV.  Big screen projection television.  That's huge.  Nice.  And we're going to do that Sunday.  All right.  Are you ready to go, Anthony?  Ready.  All right.  Hi, Andy W.  Hello?  Hi.  You got a question for Anthony?  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'd like to know who's the character you play, the young Bruno.  Are you?  Clemenza.  Oh, Clemenza.  Oh, you almost blew it.  Bruno Kirby. 
[23:30]
 Oh, man.  I got it.  Also the limo driver in Spinal Tap.  There you go.  I'm sitting here waiting on the line.  I'm like, oh, man.  Am I going to get through?  Am I going to get through?  What's your name, buddy?  My name is Jude Wilson.  And where are you calling from?  Jersey City, New Jersey.  All right.  Thanks.  Later, man.  Hi, Andy W.  Hello?  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, Dennis.  All right, Dennis.  What do you got?  What was the Undertaker's name in the first movie?  Ah, Buenos Aires.  Oh.  Look how they massacred my boy. 
[24:00]
 Not bad.  All right, man.  Are you ready to do this service for your Don?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Thanks, man.  No problem.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Hi.  All right.  Okay.  For Godfather 1, this may be easy, may be hard.  I don't know.  For the Godfather 1, who played the baby in the baptism scene?  It's a name you'll know.  Isn't that that annoying Sofia Coppola?  Oh, it sure is.  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  She gets her mug in the first one.  Yeah.  And she decides she's got a star in the third one. 
[24:30]
 And wreck it.  And wreck it.  Mm-hmm.  Well, thanks for playing.  Okay.  Hi, Andy W.  Hi.  Hi.  What was Vito Coyoni's real-ass name in Godfather 2?  Andolini.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Hi, Andy W.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Rich.  All right.  Rich, you got a question for Anthony.  Sure.  All right.  What was the sport that Hyman Roth was watching on TV when Michael Clonione came to talk to  him in Miami?  Oh, and they had to keep turning it up so his wife wouldn't hear. 
[25:00]
 That's right.  Football.  That's right.  Oh.  Thanks for playing, all right?  Okay.  What's the story behind it?  What's the story behind it?  What's the story behind it?  What's the story behind it?  It's a story about a man who's got a house in Miami, and he's going to the house of Don  Chichol.  Right.  And he kills them.  They're leaving.  Him and his friends are leaving.  Who gets injured?  Him and his friends are leaving.  Who gets injured?  Yeah.  Hold on. 
[25:30]
 After he killed him.  Yep.  Is it Tessio?  Nope.  Who?  Don Tomasino.  Oh.  Okay.  Don Tomasino.  That's why he's in the wheelchair.  Wow.  Very good, man.  Yeah?  What's your name?  Tony.  Tony, guess what?  What?  You're dumped to Anthony, which means you got a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers.  Cool.  And you have qualified to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house with that 53-inch  Sony TV.  Yeah.  Cool.  Hold on the line.  We're going to get more info from you. 
[26:00]
 Sure.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  You're on such a roll there, too, Ann.  He got me with that one.  But yeah, that makes sense.  I couldn't remember his name.  Damn.  That was a good run.  I think he got about eight.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.E.W.  Kenny Wayne Shepard, blue on black, sugar raised ladies before that every morning from  there, CD 1459, it's Opie and Anthony having a lot of fun for a Monday.  I got to quickly say, has anyone else seen the latest issue of details with Elizabeth  Hurley on the cover?  Yeah, baby. 
[26:30]
 I never thought she was hot, but now I am convinced of it.  She's got a good look there on that cover.  Look how they airbrushed the nips out now.  They're barely in there.  You're showing me from a distance, so I kind of see them.  But yeah, that's the maximum allowable nip for a displayable magazine.  They definitely airbrushed it out.  Rick's saying there's a dirty girl picture in there.  Oh, why didn't you show me that, Rick?  Yeah.  In the meantime, Al from Fairlawn, New Jersey, we were talking about chick flicks that we've 
[27:00]
 been dragged to.  Yes.  The worst movie that a guy could be dragged to was How to Make an American Quilt.  It was two and a half hours of pure pain.  Do you remember the ads for that one?  It looked like just a bunch of old women knitting a quilt and what, Winona Ryder was in it?  And they're talking to her about the quilt.  Oh my God!  Could you imagine being a guy?  I'm going to sit through that? 
[27:30]
 Quilting!  Us guys will do that early on in a relationship.  We will go to these stupid movies.  But think about it, ladies.  You've been with the same guy for a long time now.  When was the last time you dragged him to something like that and he went with it and  he didn't have an excuse?  Jesus.  How to Make an American Quilt.  Jen goes to the movies herself now and she wants to see those.  She gets pissed at me.  She's like, yeah, well, I guess that's one I'll be going by myself to say.  Like which one?  Yeah. 
[28:00]
 Which one?  What's it like today?  Like the one you saw over the weekend?  You've got mail.  She's probably going to go to the movie theater today.  Yeah, you've got mail.  That's real smart.  Let's encourage everyone to find their long lost love on the Internet.  Their soulmates.  Oh, well that's where you find your best people.  On the Internet.  Your best perverts.  And then at the end of the movie, Meg Ryan is going to just finally meet this guy, which  obviously is Tom Hanks, in a park in New York.  Like she's going to walk to this park by herself.  Yeah, that's real safe.  And I'll hack her to pieces. 
[28:30]
 Monster dad on the cover of the post.  I think he was looking for a date.  That's a horrible story.  Wow, that is a dirty picture.  Let me see.  And details of it.  Oh, look at this.  Well, she's standing in front of a washing machine.  It's a black and white picture.  She almost looks like Courtney Love there.  Oh, yeah.  She's got the hurling sheik working.  Yeah, and she's she's grabbing herself.  Looks like she's scratching an itch.  Little itch ski.  And on the instant feedback, yeah, because we're trying to turn the tide here and talk 
[29:00]
 to the ladies a little bit because, you know, all us guys have been dragged to some horrible  movies in our time.  And I'm I'm interested to find out what movies the ladies have been dragged to in their time.  And I think this is Janice.  Janice writes, the worst movie I had to sit through was Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, my God, that movie was great.  It's one of the best movies ever.  Oh, I tell. 
[29:30]
 Yeah.  And Quentin Tarantino directed, obviously.  Come on.  That was good.  But that's what the ladies are thinking.  Maybe maybe like they're sitting there while we're watching Reservoir Dogs, like like we're  sitting there watching How Stella Got a Groove.  How Stella Got a Groove.  What was the other one?  The other one with the black chicks.  Oh, they're all.  It just looked like they were constantly drinking wine and dancing and talking about how men  saw.  That's on HBO all the time. 
[30:00]
 Oh, line one we need.  OK, let me go over here.  Oh, it's horrible.  Multimedia, Opie and Anthony Studio.  I can't even sit through the commercials for those kind of movies.  Hi, N.A.W.  Hi there.  Hi.  OK, you guys want a bad one?  Yeah.  When I was in college, I was dating this guy.  I set him up with a computer deck.  Yeah.  Somebody dared me.  So we went to go see Iron Eagle with Lou Gossett.  It like totally sucked.  Oh, I feel for you.  Climb high, climb high and play the tape. 
[30:30]
 OK, I got one more though.  OK.  When my husband and I were dating before we were actually engaged, I took him to Turns  of Endearment.  He laughed.  He walked out and dragged me to a hotel.  Not only did he not have to see the movie, but he still got some.  Wow, you're right.  I think it was 10 years ago.  Just standing online for a ticket to that entitles him to any orifice he wishes.  Believe me.  I love your show.  Thank you. 
[31:00]
 Nothing beats those women with one dying movies like the frigging Stepmother.  That's the latest one.  What guy's been dragged to that atrocity?  I'm not going to see Stepmother.  That's one that I think our chicks went to see that together.  I think Jen and Sandy went to see that.  Well, they were smart enough not to ask because they own that one.  Exactly.  They realized there's no way in hell.  And I got rooked into You've Got Mail just because I played my PlayStation for 16 hours.  Yeah. 
[31:30]
 Barbara Hershey.  Beaches.  Hi, NAW.  Hi.  Hi.  My husband made me watch Scarface.  It was awful.  Come on.  That's great.  Why did you say Scarface?  Oh my God.  I love Pachino, but I hated Scarface.  I hated it.  That's great.  It's too violent.  See, it just shows that men and women...  I love The Godfather.  I love The Godfather.  We have the epic and we watch it all the time.  Say hi to my little friend. 
[32:00]
 I mean, those lines that are the best.  Gold pelican.  Yeah.  Guys and women, we just think completely different.  Your womb is salt polluted.  That's great.  You compare that.  Like you hated seeing that as much as a guy would hate seeing beaches.  I don't get it.  No, I don't either.  You're still there?  No, we hung up on her by accident.  All right. 
[32:30]
 That's kind of weird.  Yeah.  There are ladies sitting there going that they hated Scarface and there's guys out there  saying, well, I hated the horse whisperer.  The horse whisperer.  Now playing.  All right.  Trying to get through some more of this instant feedback.  There's a ton of it today.  There's a guy that needs your, oh my God, I got dragged to beloved.  I like the movies that that movie trailer announcement guy can announce good.  Those are the ones I'll see.  International terrorists have taken over and there's only one man that can stop it. 
[33:00]
 Like that whole thing.  Sure.  You never hear him like fried green tomatoes.  Action.  Epic adventure of women sitting, eating fried green tomatoes.  It happened in a small town.  It happened in a small town.  An explosive depot.  Beloved.  This guy's right.  This guy's writing about beloved. 
[33:30]
 He lost three hours of his life.  That'll never get back.  That's funny.  That's great.  That's funny.  And Anthony, really fast before we take a quick break here.  Help Anthony.  It's all your fault.  I started playing that stupid game Half Life and my wife's threatening to leave me.  So the least you could do is help me get out of this section.  I've been stuck in for two days.  All right.  All right.  Help this guy out.  It says, how do you jump to the FN fire escape from the electrical cabinet in the surface tension level? 
[34:00]
 Oh my God.  God.  You got to hit the crouch button as you jump.  You could jump higher that way.  All right.  Is that real early in the game?  Yeah.  He's kind of early in the game there.  Okay.  You might have just saved the marriage with that little tip.  No, I probably ruined it because once you get Half Life and you're a guy and you're married,  your marriage is ruined anyway.  It doesn't matter.  I don't know who invented that game.  All right.  We got more to come.  One of the things we're doing today on the show is discussing movies you've been dragged to. 
[34:30]
 And someone just faxed this over Anthony.  W N A W just says two words.  Steel Magnolias.  No name, no explanation.  Just a big letters.  Doesn't need it.  One of two seven W N A W the rock in New York losing my religion.  It's opiate Anthony and the phones are just lit with people discussing what movie they've been dragged to in the past.  Man, there is a big difference between men and women when it comes to this one kids. 
[35:00]
 Wow.  I any W work moving my husband ever dragged me to Dennis Rodman and John Claude Van Damme.  I think it's double team.  All right.  We'll give you that one.  Okay.  I think the worst thing I ever got him to go to though was the sequel to eat.  It's a sequel to Terms of Endearment.  It was called Evening Star.  Oh, it was horrible.  You guys just love torturing each other.  Oh, yeah.  It's like a game.  It's ongoing.  All right.  Well, you guys know you guys are the best.  Hey, thank you.  Have a good night. 
[35:30]
 Hi, any W.  Yeah, I was calling about the chick movie thing.  Yeah, what do you got?  I had to not only go see Emma and Sense and Sensibility, but had to read Sense and Sensibility.  Why?  Well, it was where I was engaged to my fiance and she wanted to read the real.  We should read the same book.  Sorry, I'll give it a try.  I'll give it a try.  Dude, that's trouble right there.  You just run away.  It's like took 10 years off my life.  I couldn't get through it.  I was like a hundred pages into it and I just had to give up. 
[36:00]
 I love those chicks.  I want to make it.  They're going to better you.  They want to make you read their books and if that's happening before you marry, you  know what happens after you marry?  Yeah, your testicles get removed.  I know I got cable.  I got like the Jane Austen channel.  It's like Emma all the time.  All the time.  No, it's called Lifetime.  Ever been anything on Lifetime that guys are into?  Oh, no, nothing.  Let's see Lifetime movie.  The girl she's going out with the guy. 
[36:30]
 Oh, it's going great.  Oh, he's a scumbag.  Look at that.  What a surprise.  Story, Christy McNichols.  Starring Valerie Bertinelli on Lifetime.  Linda Carter.  For her with the context first in between there.  Hi, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Great job.  Bye bye.  Thanks.  That's suck when you walk in the living room.

Well, let's not forget about waiting to exhale. 
[38:00]
 Waiting to exhale.  Yeah, but now I mean, it wasn't even in English.  I mean, she just quieted the whole movie.  It was terrible.  Oh gosh, you have to sit through that.  I don't know.  The piano was worse than that movie.  The first wives club was worse than that movie.  Here we go.  I got one for you.  Yeah.  What's that?  Oh, the time of my life.  Oh, God.  I did suck.  I know what you have to sit through now.  Now.  It's terrible.  All right.

That's run off their CD dosage.  You could also find that on the varsity blue soundtrack.  Got some instant feedback from some people and they said that that movie wasn't as as  good as the previews.  Really looks like a good one to check out.  I haven't seen it yet. 
[39:30]
 I was too busy seeing you've got mail last night.  So you've got mail.  What a waste.  All right.  Anyway, we got to give away the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and qualify another  person to a Super Bowl party thrown in your house.  The deal is Steve Mason and the morning show.

[40:00]
 winners and we're just going to come over with the party.  Yeah, so be ready.  All right, bring your friends and this hour we're doing Godfather trivia once again.  I did pretty good last round.  I was very proud and got to like eight questions and then I got hoodwinked.  You got stumped on the knife.  Yeah, you never know the first guy here could stump you.  I know I'm not saying I'm a genius or a pro at this.  I just watch a lot of television and that's all.  All right.  Want to go the phone to give it a try. 
[40:30]

He said he never met Johnny Ola before when they introduced him and then he started talking  about how him and Johnny used to take him to the spa.  All right, you got it.  I thought you got us.  Thanks.  Go.  Hi, any W.  Hello, any W.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, I think I have a Godfather's number. 
[41:30]
 Okay.  I just hang on and wait.  No, we're right here live in the air.  Go.  All righty.  Before Tom Hagen, who is Vito Corleone's consigliere?  Consigliere.  Yep.  Well, let's say, hmm, that's um, that's interesting.  Uh-oh.  I'm thinking.  Okay.  It has to be.  I wouldn't think either.  Hmm.  I gotta go with Sally. 
[42:00]
 Tessio?  Nope.  It's the same person I used when I screwed up last time.  Who?  Okay.  It was Janko from Janko Olive Oil Company.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Positive?  Yeah.

[42:30]
 All right.  Oh, she got me.  That was a quick round.  I don't remember that.  Hi, any W.  Any W.  How you doing?  Hi.  I got one for you.  Well, we qualified the person, but we still want to hear your question.  Okay, the name of the olive oil company, Janko.  How do you spell that?  G-E-N-C-O.  That's my last name and nobody can spell it.  It's really J-A-N-C-O and everything.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  Priceline.com was just thrown in front of my face here. 
[43:00]
 We love Priceline.com.  I personally love them.  Why do you keep calling me Anthony?  Oh, sorry.  William Shatner.  Priceline.  I don't like Priceline.  What do you mean you don't like Priceline?  It never has helped me.  Priceline's never helped me.  Why hasn't it ever helped you?  You're the spokesperson for Priceline.com.  I can...  Sorry, that was the evil Kirk.  He transported in the evil Kirk.  Because only the evil Kirk would not like Priceline. 
[43:30]
 I love Priceline.  Yes.  Saved me many quap loops on Rigel 7.  Now did you get a bargain on the hotel rooms when you were traveling?  Of course.  When I traveled the universe, I'd pick up many green women and need a quick place to crash.  I call a Priceline.  And now they've given me a free room.  Well, if you use their service, yes, they will give you a free hotel night if you go on the internet. 
[44:00]
 So when I shack up with that big-breasted slave woman from Triskelion, I can stay an extra night.  That's right.  Only with Priceline.  I can't keep a straight face.  All right, so you go on the internet, you name your own price for a hotel room if you're traveling in the near future, and Priceline.com will beat it.  No, they won't.  They won't beat it?  No. 
[44:30]
 Once again, the evil Kirk has gotten, of course they will.  They'll beat the price.  That's what you would normally pay.  Simple as this.  If you're traveling soon, you need a flight, you need some hotel rooms, give Priceline.com a try on the internet or give them a call.  1-800-Priceline.  Are you done now, Mr.  Shatner?  Yes, get us out of here.  You want to intro the song, Shatner?  I love this one.  I sing it.  I had a dream.  People want you.  That's a crazy dream. 
[45:00]
 The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Johnny Lang, still raining.  Is it still snowing?  Is it?  I figured I'd do a little DJ segue there, but I can't see out the window.  I don't know.  It might be snowing or raining where you're at.  Who cares?  I just want to see the sun one more time before I die.  When was the last time we saw the sun?  I don't know.  It's depressing, isn't it?  Thank God I got Play Stations.  It really makes the winter's fly by. 
[45:30]
 When you're stuck in the middle of one of those games.  At least you have, yeah.  Kind of an option.  I'm in the middle of Tomb Raider III Hell.  I'm Half-Life.  But you're not in Half-Life Hell because you finally finished the game, right?  I finished the single-player game, but now I'm on multiplayer, which I just love.  Well, that's more just shoot them up and let's have some fun.  Oh, just simplify it, Opie.  Simplify it.  Yeah, shoot them up. 
[46:00]
 Just because you're walking by and a bag on the ground blows you in half.  You don't have to worry about that, now do you?  Not really.  Hey, man, I'm still trying to figure out how to get past the Cobra on the waterfall cliffs of Tomb Raider III.  Well, how about killing it?  Well, that's what someone suggested.  As I'm jumping to that ledge, it has to be a perfect jump after making four perfect jumps before that.  To get the opportunity to kill the Cobra, someone suggested I start shooting as I'm in the air jumping. 
[46:30]
 Because as soon as I get on the ledge, the Cobra bites me and knocks me all the way down into the cavern.  I got to start all over, climb up and make three precision jumps that are almost impossible to make.  I know what I have to do, but I need a 12-year-old kid to come over my house to make the maneuver for me.  You're the only one capable of doing it, yeah.  Because I know exactly what to do.  I know I have to jump and as I'm in the air, I have to jump to the left and land on a dime.  I just can't do it.  I got PlayStation thumbs, they're numb. 
[47:00]
 Can't feel them.  Your thumbs went numb.  I spent four hours on this section.  Four hours trying to get past the Cobra.  I understand.  How's Sandy handling it?  Good.  She's like my co-pilot.  She's into it right now.  Let's wait a few weeks and see though.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Because Jen just...  I mean I spent hours upon hours on end on this thing and she just gets pissed. 
[47:30]
 Like when I sit and watch some TV with her, she's like,  Oh, well, I guess I have an hour with you.  But honey, the guys, like a kid used to go, the guys are waiting for me at the field.  Yeah.  They're outside.  I'm looking at the computer.  The guys are right there waiting for me.  Honey, I'm Fragmaster.  And now that I have to get in the room.  And now that I got the cable modem.  Yeah.  Something new to check out.  I got to hook up.  I'm the pro with the crossbow. 
[48:00]
 God, you let me ever do nothing.  So how is the cable modem?  Is it...  Oh, this thing kicks ass.  Does it just bring the games to a new level?  I don't know what I was playing before.  It was great, but nothing compared to this.  I mean I log on my connections so fast.  And you could tell that the little jittery people,  like you see them walking through and they're kind of spazzing.  And you know, they have lousy connections.  Go right up behind and put the shotgun to the back of the head.  Boom! 
[48:30]
 I just...  He's all over the wall.  You laugh.  You mark them.  You could actually mark your territory with these spray paint thing.  You just go...  And it marks on the wall, whatever you want.  I put my picture in there.  I spray it with me flipping the bird.  F you!  And this is...  You put it right on the dead body.  Right over the body.  When people come by they're like,  Ooh, who did that?  You know who did it?  I did it!  Fragmaster!  No, honey, I'll be right there! 
[49:00]
 Poopsie!  Alright, sweetheart, I'm coming for the death.  I FRAG-GIRL!  We all have to live in our own little reality.  Yeah.  Or lack thereof.  And you have to take out the garbage in between games.  Yeah.  I'm typing in.  Now you know the power of Fragmaster!  I have slaughtered you!  Your brains are on the garbage!  Yeah, honey, I got it!  I got it!  You will not ever beat Fragma- 
[49:30]
 Alright, honey!  Five more minutes!  I'm a mess.  We're grown men.  We play video games.  Mess.  What do we have to look forward to?  Like the kids that are, what, 12, 15, 16?  I know all ages are playing these games, but, you know, the kids today, they don't know how well they have it.  What did we have?  What was the big video game, Anthony, when you and I were 15 or 16? 
[50:00]
 Pong!  Damn pong!  Pong.  Boy, let's make the paddle bigger and play tennis.  Alright, well, let's cut the field in half.  Now we're playing handball.  Boy, this is, this is great.  I remember watching Wonderama and Bob McAllister used to give it away if you won like the Snake Canyon game.  I'd be like, I can only get pong! 
[50:30]
 This is like the greatest thing ever!  You play it on your TV!  I remember going to the bowling alley in Huntington, which is now a supermarket.  Yeah.  And they had a video game.  All it was, if someone remembers the name of this game, I would love to know.  Well, it's actually Circolis.  It was two gunslingers.  Okay.  Right.  And there was a tree in the middle.  Yeah.  And that was it.  That's it.  And you try to kill the other guy.  By what?  Like sneaking out from behind the chair?  Yeah, you got to kind of, you know, it's kind of like, you know, thumb wrestling. 
[51:00]
 You got to tease him a little.  Hope he goes for the tease and you shoot.  That was the damn game.  You won't be needing the graphics accelerator on that one.  No, you wouldn't.  That was the game, though.  And what about when we were on the school bus?  Um, God, what was the name of it?  We were talking about it in the back office.  Oh, the Coleco.  The Coleco.  The handheld games.  Yes.  Where you play football and all it was is a red LED light.  And it would go like beep, beep, beep up the field.  And there's like two blockers. 
[51:30]
 That all they do is split and you kind of, you hit the arrow key.  Come on, come on, touchdown.  Yeah.  This is great.  You'd play for hours on the school bus.  Oh, yeah.  Thought it was the best thing.  Now you need like thousands of dollars worth of equipment to play.  I like games.  Oh, I love it.  Well, we're going to talk.  Dict it.  We're going to talk more about the the movies you've been dragged to.  We'll do that next.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW. 
[52:00]
 Deep Purple Space Trucking from Machine Head.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The name of that video game was Outlaw.  Oh, the lousy video game you used to play.  What?  But it was happening.  If it was in the arcades in the bowling alley, it was one of the hottest games.  What year was this?  70s, I guess.  70s?  Yeah.  Mid to late 70s.  Yeah.  They didn't really have a lot of video games in the mid to late 70s.  No, no.  So at the end of the 70s, you got into your asteroids, space invaders. 
[52:30]
 And they started getting into, I remember Jouse.  Jouse was cool.  Where you used to ride the giant chicken.  And Defender was great.  They used to love Defender.  Which one was Defender again?  Where you were flying like it was a side shot of your little ship and you're flying.  You had up and down and fire control and things would come at you.  I remember Defender.  Defender rocked.  And then of course we moved into Donkey Kong and Pac-Man.  Pac-Man was earlier.  Yeah.  And Pac-Man was around the same time as Jouse and Defender. 
[53:00]
 Yeah.  Centipede.  Centipede rocked.  Yeah.  Like Centipede.  But those games are pretty ridiculous compared to what's going on today.  Now it's just, you really date yourself when you start saying, yeah, I was into Centipede.  Yeah.  Asteroids.  Oh boy, look.  I just blew it up into a bunch of little pieces.  Oh, look, it hit me. 
[53:30]
 But what graphics?  Yeah.  I need my Voodoo 2 chip for this and my graphics accelerator.  Sure you do.  I get lots of email today and faxes and phone calls.  You guys are on fire today.  Usually on Mondays everyone takes a little break from our show.  Yeah.  You guys don't feel like participating on Mondays usually.  Or maybe we just suck on Mondays.  I think that's probably the case.  Faxline 212-957-WNEW.  Hey guys, did you see in the movie, You've Got Mail, Anthony didn't see it.  I saw it this weekend.  I had to after playing the Tomb Raider 3 for 16 hours. 
[54:00]
 I had to give a little back Anthony.  Just a little.  Anyway, and You've Got Mail.  How they tried to make the guys who were dragged to see it like it a little more by adding some Godfather scenes or dialogues.  That was the issue.  Oh really?  Tom Hanks was reciting Godfather lines for the whole damn thing.  Talking about you got to go to the mattresses and...  Oh, that'll do it.  Yeah.  You know, that'll definitely get you.  Nothing personal.  It's just business and he's just reciting lines.  Is that really? 
[54:30]
 They tried like pulling that little loose?  Yeah, so the guys who were sitting there, you know, hating it.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Enjoyed a little better.  But you know, you know, the movie started of the movie in the paper said, you know, 915.  Guess what time we got to the theater?  What?  930.  Did we miss the beginning of the movie?  Hell, no, you know, I'll cut some previews.  We still had another 10 minutes of previews.  I think the movie started like 940.  Yeah, they're showing entirely too many previews in the movie theater now.  Seriously, just go to the theater late.  You're not going to miss it because you see the time. 
[55:00]
 Oh my God movie starts 915.  No, no, that's when the previews start.  You still got another 10 to 15 minutes.  The lights got like, all right, cool.  Yeah, yeah, and I'm just sick of that guy's voice.  International terrorists have taken over the city, but he makes every movie sound cool.  And only one man can solve the problem.  Right.  Oh my God, and then the goofy music stars and inspector gadget.  Inspector gadget.  Then it ended in and then ended in. 
[55:30]
 But terrible.  The best part of you got mail.  It's a whole commercial for AOL.  And we said this earlier, Meg Ryan's, you know, signing on and it takes her to sign on to AOL five seconds in the movie.  Oh, yeah, where they show the phone dialing and the connection.  The whole theater starts laughing like, yeah, right, five seconds going online after work.  It's good.  It's good.  It takes her five seconds to get on online.  And then all seconds are busy. 
[56:00]
 Please tie again.  Yeah.  Well, because of you've got mail, we got in the discussion.  What stupid movie have you been dragged to?  Yeah.  And, you know, over the years.  Oh, we've gotten some winners.  Beaches, Steel Magnolias, Bridges of Madison County, Fried Green Tomatoes, Horse Whisperer, The Horse Whisperer, Horse Whisperer, Action Pack.  It's The Horse Whisperer.  No, don't think so.  No.  Emma.  Emma. 
[56:30]
 Coming to a theater near you.  It's Emma.  Kicking ass and taking names.  And then we got into the subject of the Lifetime Channel, Anthony.  Valerie Bertinelli.  In a lifetime special presentation.  I can't stand that bastard.  Yeah, look at this guy, Lloyd.  Lloyd Cohn.  He has it right.  He put he goes, I put lifetime on parental control and did not give my  girlfriend the unlock code.  That's all the lifetime problem. 
[57:00]
 He's locking his girlfriend out from lifetime.  That's funny.  All right.  We're also asking the ladies what movie have you been dragged to that you just absolutely hated?  Let's go the phones here.  Hi, Andy W.  Is this Opie or Anthony?  Both of us.  Okay.  Hi.  Hi.  I was just listening to you guys whining about being dragged to Chick Flex.  Yes.  And I was dragged to Ford Fairlane by my boyfriend.  Who is now at the time at the time he was my boyfriend.  Now he's my husband. 
[57:30]
 You didn't like Ford Fairlane?  No, you did.  No, it was pretty bad.  Yeah, it was really bad.  It was torture.  This bitch don't know nothing.  Ah, you know something, you're probably a whore.  That's why you didn't like it.  That was Oscar material.  That movie should have won an Oscar.  But whores like you, they don't like that.  What didn't you like about Ford Fairlane?  Well, first of all, it put me to sleep in the movie theater.  Put you to sleep?  You probably were all tired from not sleeping the night before when you was out whoring. 
[58:00]
 My friend and I, my husband, we both got...  That poor bastard.  That poor bastard, that's your husband.  He is now.  I feel sorry for the poor bastard.  We got woken up by the usheret tapping us on the shoulder with a little flashlight  and the whole movie theater was all bright and everyone was looking at us laughing.  They wasn't laughing at you.  They was laughing at Ford Fairlane.  It was a brilliant motion picture. 
[58:30]
 You're just too stupid to know.  Dice, if you were so good, why don't you have a movie career?  I got plenty of movies coming out.  Oh, yeah?  Plenty of movies.  I can't talk about them now because they're in the original kind of phase here.  I see.  Yeah, sure.  Straight to video?  It's not bad.  I don't see no film companies approaching you.  You can't even cut it on the radio.  But we're not trying to be in films.  We're not even trying to be in films. 
[59:00]
 Look at this giggling whore.  Keep giggling.  Ford Fairlane was a great movie.  It goes down with the great movies.  It wasn't that great.  It couldn't even keep me awake.  I'll keep you awake, honey.  I'll work you like a puppet.  I'll work you with two bricks and something.  Get it off of here.  I don't need this crap from a whore.  Dice is pissed.  Yeah, and I see he lost his cold too. 
[59:30]
 Yeah, how about that?  That's pretty weird.  It's nice to hear Dice feeling a little better.  And William Shatner felt a lot better today earlier.  Yeah.  Still a little bit of a cough occasionally, but kind of strange how Anthony was sick last week  and he seemed to give a sickness to everyone.  Well, Yoshi and happens and William Shatner and the Dice man.  They all got sick too.  I don't know how that happened.  Popeye got sick last week.  He said it's very contagious.  One to two seven WNAW. 
[60:00]
 The Rock of New York Matchbox 20.  Long day.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Want to say hi to all the cops listening to us today.  Hey, they're out there supporting us, protecting us.  Mm-hmm.  You won't hear any rage against machine here.  Yeah, we don't we don't back concerts for cop killers.  Call us crazy.  You know, that's pretty pathetic.  Man, that's scary. 
[60:30]
 You know anything about that case?  Yes, I do.  It's like so blatantly guilty.  Just guilty guilty.  Yeah, but we've we've passed it over for the last few weeks, but we want to say hi to all the cops  because we're noticing a lot of them are checking in today.  And also want to say hi to the Rocky Allen audience.  Hey, how you doing there?  People.  Hi, I know this is a little different than Rocky show.  You'll get used to it.  Just ask the rest of our listeners.  They hated us at first. 
[61:00]
 Yeah, but we grow on you.  Yeah, we grow on you unlike Rocky who just grows on himself and keeps growing.  Job of the Rocky.  Give it time.  Give it time.  You'll acquire a taste for the show.  It's a lot of fun when you get it.  And I guess Rocky's doing okay, I guess now.  Oh, he decided to try his hand at mornings.  That's that's a brilliant career move.  I think that's not too tough in New York.  Yeah, no, really.  I can't really think of anybody who completely has the market tied up in mornings in New York. 
[61:30]
 No, I think he has a pretty good shot at it.  Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, he'll be the biggest thing in morning radio.  We already is.  Unless he eats Howard.  Which isn't out of the realm of possibility.  A lot of people have asked us why Robin.  Hey Robin, there's a big fat guy trying to eat me.  Throw Jackie at him.  A lot of people have asked us why aren't you guys doing more ace? 
[62:00]
 We're not stupid.  Not on your life.  Who would it's so hard to come into New York and go right to mornings.  I mean Bill and anybody knows you have to do your little military buildup before you take on an enemy,  especially someone who's been so entrenched in his battlefield for so long.  Even if we thought we were great at what we do,  it would take years before anyone would know that we were even here.  Exactly.  It's very difficult to do. 
[62:30]
 So and I said, well, we'll be just a bunch of pussies.  Because there's no competition.  We'll be honest.  There you go.  We get the question all the time.  There's your answer.  I love that.  Hey guys, why don't you go to mornings?  How it'll kick your ass.  Well, yeah, right now, please.  We're not stupid.  One thing we're not.  We're not stupid.  Man, it'll beat up and everything.  It gets laid back build up some some troops got to build up our little faithful audience. 
[63:00]
 Build up the troops.  Put away the little pieces of stale bread to nibble on during the lean years.  You know, we just have to hunker down.  So we want to say hi to Rocky's old audience.  Give it time.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  You know, Paul, our lawyer friend from Jersey.  Yeah.  Paul listens to our show way too closely.  What does he got?  He's the guy that always comes up with the list of stuff that he knows about you and I.  Yeah.  Last time he had a doozy of a list about you that made you sound like a poofa. 
[63:30]
 Well, he's got some stuff about me today.  He's just making some notes about what I've said lately.  One opi paid to go to a series of chick movies such as you've got mail in bridges of Madison County.  Sorry, you got the truth.  Number two opi try to get a personal glimpse of male genitalia when a transvestite visit a studio last week.  Plus, well, that's true. 
[64:00]
 All right.  But come on out of curiosity.  I want to see the man.  The hardware when you were saying that I must admit I was a little taken aback.  Why else in the studio?  Why?  Because you're asking a guy albeit a guy with a wig and a dress on but a guy to show his as you so eloquently put it stuff.  Well, your stuff.  It's like, hey, man, let me see your stuff.  Yeah, it's like a freak show though.  I missed the freak shows at the circus.  Is that it?  Well, 
[64:30]
 and number three opi called Mrs.  Roper his fantasy girl and admitted to fantasizing about her as an adolescent.  Well, I like the moomoo dresses.  What?  Nothing about it.  Inviting a 12 year old over your house to help you with the tomb Raiders.  Oration.  Yeah, tomb Raiders 3.  That is a very innocent request.  Okay.  I explained it earlier.  Right.  I know it to a kids are a lot better with making those moves on the.  I was in the middle to Raiders 3. 
[65:00]
 I'm in a section.  I fully understand what I need to do to complete the the spot.  I meant the thumbs just won't do it.  They are no I can't.  I'm not kidding.  I can't feel my PlayStation thumbs.  All right.  I'm in the waterfall cliff section of two Raiders 3 if you want to follow along at home and after making the fourth precision jump.  Okay, there's a Cobra there and I got to kill the Cobra to move on.  The problem is I finally make the fourth jump, which is a pain in the ass because I usually fall making the first or the second jump. 
[65:30]
 I finally make the fourth jump on this clip with a damn Cobra is it bites me and knocks me all the way down into the cabin again.  I can't get past that section.  So save it right before the jump.  I have done that and it still took me hours to try to kill the Cobra.  And I fully understand what I have to do.  I have to jump and get to the back wall.  Get my guns out and kill the thing.  I understand that but I can't make the move.  So that's where the comment about getting a 12 year old kid to come to my house to get me past that section so I can move on with the game.  It sounds logical. 
[66:00]
 Sure it does.  Okay.  I'm like a Michael Jackson or anything.  I need a small child to come over my house and help me with PlayStation completely naked.  All right.  Don't sound logical.  Can you help me with his dumb?  Shut up. 
[66:30]
 All right.  Are we done here?  Oh sure.  Okay.  Oh here's the deal.  You got one last chance here later this hour when you hear New Year's Day by you to be the 10th caller at 212-757-1027 and you're going to win a $50 multi sport passport to Chelsea peers.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York you to New Year's Day.  Listen to Opie singing during that song.  I don't know what you talked about man.  You don't know what I'm talking about.  You singing. 
[67:00]
 This is what I have to listen to when there's a song on.  Opie puts his headphones on.  Prove it.  11.  Prove it.  See more headphones go up to 11 where it's one louder.  They're blasting so he sings real loud.  Nothing wrong.  Change.  Oh God.  Do you have a tape of this Anthony?  I don't know what you're talking.  I will. 
[67:30]
 Okay.  I will get one.  I don't think I'm one of the one of these days.  I'm going to hit record.  You're off on these little tears.  Well, I guess we could go to line to them.  It's a free for all in here.  Why?  Well some guy he I don't know.  He saw your girlfriend on TV this weekend.  Hi any W.  Yeah.  All right.  Yesterday I was doing the you know,  the guy thing exercise my right to have a penis.  Start from with control and I passed by this movie and I'm 
[68:00]
 looking at this movie and I see this little girl.  She's throwing a baseball.  It was Anthony's childhood girlfriend.  Tatum O'Neill.  I had to watch the bad news.  Bad just just out of compulsion to see what the hell Anthony  saw in Tatum O'Neill.  I'm thinking in my head.  What would it be like to see Anthony as a little child with  that she a pet on his head?  Riding bikes with Tatum O'Neill.  Oh Tatum let's go to the swings. 
[68:30]
 Okay, Anthony.  You're so funny.  I couldn't get this thought out of my head.  A little kid with a she a pet on his head swinging Tatum O'Neill  on the swings.  Just imagine Anthony taking her on a little date to play some  air hockey.  Hey, let's go play some air hockey.  Hey, hey, did you still look at the way she held the beer  bottle and get all excited at the end of the movie?  But she was holding that.  Silly bastard man.  Yeah, that's why you got me for a list.  Spraying that beer bottle all over everybody. 
[69:00]
 Yeah, she was a dirty girl.  He was a dirty girl.  Anthony, if Anthony saw that today he'd be going  memories may be beautiful at first.  Alright, you're a sick bastard.  Yeah, I'd love to see you soon guys.  Good job.  Good job man.  Alright man.  Bye bye.  Little lippies.  Come on.  What's he talking about?  You admitted on a past show that you had a crush on Tatum  O'Neill growing up.  We all know that now. 
[69:30]
 Who didn't?  We were all that age.  So when you saw it was like I was a kid.  Yeah, if you had a crush on Tatum O'Neill you might as well  have had a crush on Christy McNichols too.  No, Christy McNichols is a dyke.  Well Tatum looked kind of dyke-y in that movie.  No, I think she was a kid.  I mean I was a kid.  That's what I looked like.  No, I didn't like Christy.  Do you like every girl that was your age in school?  This is like one of those kind of little, you know,  crush things, you know, that you had when you were a kid. 
[70:00]
 Just look and go, oh yeah, well she's cute.  Look cute kid.  Alright, I'll admit it.  No, I can't admit that.  Ho, ho.  Tell me, I won't tell anybody.  No, Nadia Comanej.  What?  What? I didn't say nothing.  Nadia Comanej?  She's a man.  She's a man, baby. 
[70:30]
 Well, yeah, Nadia.  Yeah, Nadia.  Give me a break.  She's a little older than me.  It was the first wet dream I had.  It's Nadia Comanej.  Oh my God, too much information.  Really?  Yeah.  What did you?  Watch her on the balance beam.  You're a dirty little gymnast, aren't you?  Yeah, you rousing up those hands.  Yeah. 
[71:00]
 Nadia.  Yeah, what the?  You're laughing at me for Tatum O'Neil,  which was totally like normal when I was that age.  Tatum and Nadia.  Come on.  What?  Alright, lots of babes right there.  Come on, go up a couple of movies.  For Tatum.  Okay.  She got a little older, pretty hot.  And a couple of years,  Nadia Comanej got uglier.  Great.  Tatum got boobs and 
[71:30]
 Nadia got a mustache.  I was young.  All right.  Hey Rick.  Talking around the little foxes phase.  That was pretty hot, right?  Foxes?  What was that called?  I don't remember that movie.  Yeah, the little the one where she had to lose her virginity.  McCamp movie.  A little bit of a darling.  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  Who is our latest winner for this chance to have open  ankle to your house?  This Super Bowl.  You want you to get a lot of the children. 
[72:00]
 There are a lot of places.  I pray that we don't have to go to.  Oh my God.  Here's your imagination.  But what a crazy idea.  This is Sue to me of St.  James is the last winner.  All right.  Well, I like St.  James.  I can handle that's good.  I can handle St.  James.  I like St.  James.  There's a lot of towns I can't handle.  Obviously management around here loves us.  Yeah, let's take open Anthony who pretty much have been on  the radio seven months and most people hate can't stand it.  I love the chance to beat the ass out of them. 
[72:30]
 Yeah, get them with their drunk friends and lock them in  a house.  Oh, that's good idea.  Great idea.  Ouch.  We're scared just walking into this building and now you now  we are going to someone's house for the Super Bowl personal  visits.  Can we screen the people make sure they're not serial killers  and out of our hands now we're going to set.  It's a bad idea.  It's great idea.  Well, that's right.  We're supposed to support things nowadays. 
[73:00]
 Yeah, you're not scared.  S-list will be all right.  I know there'll be fun people.  All right.  I just hope it's someone like we met at the at the the the  Bronco.  Yeah, I think I'd go to any one of those people's houses.  Oh, that's probably what it's going to be like.  Oh, thank you.  That's cross-section of our listeners and pick one and  pray.  We're playing the lotto. 
[73:30]
 Yeah, pretty much playing the lottery.  You never know.  We're playing Russian roulette.  Yeah, we can either get someone really cool or we can get  someone that really hates us.  Yes, and they were locked in their house for seven hours  and I put the big huge 53 inch big screen Sony projection TV.  Well, that's good.  Well, that's very cool.  I mean the idea sounds great on the surface, but it's just a  little scary.  I'm a people person.  I'm going to have fun people person going to sit there and  have fun.  What was the last time you left your house?  I leave my house a lot. 
[74:00]
 Not since Half-Life.  I used to leave my house.  Yeah, can we bring over our video game?  Wouldn't that be good on the 53 and Sony big screen projection  TV?  I'll play Tomb Raider 3.  I'm bringing my PlayStation and everyone will have to watch  me at halftime.  Honey, we want to watch the game that Opie is on the  PlayStation.  Rock of New York 1027 WMW.  What it's like ever last from Whitey Fort Sings the Blues. 
[74:30]
 Soapy and Anthony.  Heading out the door.  We have a lot of fun today for a Monday show.  Flew by.  Thanks for the participation.  We appreciate it.  Did I think we hit a nerve?  We realized guys and girls.  Once again on this show, we realized guys and girls are a  lot different than each other.  Oh, just a little young just a tad.  Somebody emailed and said that book men are from Mars women  are from Venus was wrong because he picked two planets that  are two still too close together.  It should be the men are from Mercury women are from Pluto. 
[75:00]
 Pluto not a planet anymore.  Oh stop.  Been trying to kick that poor planet out or add another one  behind it.  The solar system has nine planets.  That's it.  That's it.  Stop.  That's right.  Try to modify that.  I learned it in school.  We have the thing hanging up on the ceiling with the big  grapefruit sun and the planets spinning around and the world  is flat.  Yes, the world is flat.  You'll fall off the edge if you try.  That's right.  And then the sun revolves around.  Now we wait wait. 
[75:30]
 I would say the earth is resting on the top of the  tortoises back.  We are the center of the universe.  Everything revolves around us.  All right.  Well,  there you go.  We got to just about everything.  Joe DiMaggio still alive.  Contrary to NBC.  Boy did they pull over what they call a boner on that one.  Didn't they?  Well, the funny thing about that whole thing TV is so  competitive that every single other station had to make sure  they put the NBC logo on their screen and talked about how 
[76:00]
 horrible it is what the NBC did to Joe DiMaggio.  The peacocks screwed up the screw the pooch this time.  Yeah.  Yeah, they like doing that every TV station screws up as soon  as they screw up the eligible jump on it like a bunch of  packed wild dogs on a gazelle.  Now what they do exactly they ran a crawl like the little  words that you basically put the weather bulletin at the  bottom of the screen.  Yeah, I guess.  And it said Joe DiMaggio was dead. 
[76:30]
 I like the idea that they just have those waiting.  Yeah.  Oh, it's ready to go.  They're just waiting.  I think at the whole you know, the whole 10 minute piece ready  to go.  So they said I'm edited and ready to go an engineer or something  like hit it by accident.  And it started going because it was programmed and in there  and waiting to go.  Yeah.  So well, they're going to have their little vignette on  jolted Joe says he drops.  It's all done.  It's it's done and waiting. 
[77:00]
 They have the old bit.  They have the picture of jolted Joe with the date he was born  and right died.  Here's a little footage of him in Maryland.  Everything's waiting.  Here's the 56 game hitting streak, you know, here's recent  footage of him walking out on on the diamond at the stadium.  Yeah, all done and ready to go.  Sure.  Got the voiceover and everything.  They're just waiting for him to drop.  Jolted Joe DiMaggio.  Yes.  And then the other thing real fast that we couldn't get to  today. 
[77:30]
 Did you know that one of the village people is homeless?  No, Victor Willis, the cop.  He's homeless and squatting in Frisco.  Take your own joke, but I bet the police department was so  happy when that whole thing came out.  You have to be a cop.  Oh, look, he's a cop.  He's a gay cop.  Great.  Yeah.  No, really.  Thanks for taking care of us.  Am I great?  All right.  So he's homeless.  Yeah, that's what they say today. 
[78:00]
 Go to the YMCA like he's been pitching for years.  Young man.  Yeah.  All right.  And finally, I can't find anyone else that agrees with me  that not a common each was hot when we were growing up.  That's that's a little weird.  We talked about some bizarre stuff on this show.  All right, man.  All right.  That's it.  We'll see you for  summer Tuesday tomorrow.  Yes.  And also two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday tomorrow.  But yes, you want to promo that.
