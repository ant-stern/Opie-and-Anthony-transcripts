 After yesterday's show we figured that would be a perfect song to start today's show.  Good slang, old bike.  It's Hope and Anthony.  Want to say hi to everyone that joined the Tuesday Night Hummer Club last night.  Congratulations.  Congrats, you're in.  Now we have hundreds and hundreds of members.  Yes we do.  Man, what a day yesterday, huh?  Yeah, thanks for all the feedback and email and phone calls and faxes.  It looks like everyone enjoyed yesterday's show.  Laura was a big hit.  She enlightened the people with her sexploits and had that couple on the air that finished 
[00:30]
 one of her little techniques and then came back on the air with us and the guy was just  flabbergasted.  He was blown away.  Literally.  It's a technique.  Yeah, literally.  It's a technique from her new book, 52 Invitations to Great Sex and she left with a couple of  loose ends because she wants obviously people to buy her book.  So she doesn't tell us what some of these things are.  You know, like what the couple did yesterday that made the guy like totally have this remarkable 
[01:00]
 orgasm.  Right.  Well, Anthony, we're going to tell you.  Yeah, in my head, Anthony, I got the page.  All right.  This is what the couple did yesterday.  Okay.  How are you going to be able to read this, Opie?  What do you mean?  Get finesse around some of these words.  Yeah, we will.  All right.  We're going to do it later on in the show.  We got all.  We too got to tease it a little bit.  I mean, we're willing to give out the secret, but we need you guys to listen a little bit  today.  Yeah. 
[01:30]
 So we will give away the secret of what the couple was doing that had the guy just freaking  out.  And we also, I think, can find the whole thing about the blue balloon from yesterday's show.  Yeah, I don't know what that's about.  We still got to find it, but I think we I think we know where it is.  Some reason it is.  Oh, there it is.  The blue balloon number 41 in the book.  We'll give away this to today.  So we got to get back to our faithful listeners that of course stand by us day in and day  out. 
[02:00]
 So that's one thing to look forward to on the show today.  But then have to wonder what happened.  Right.  Can't have that.  No, no.  They waited 24 hours.  Now they need the answer.  Right.  And we will do that.  And I guess we're ready to rock and roll.  Yes, we are.  Are you and Carol all, you know, fine now, Anthony?  God, I wish the mics were up yesterday after we got off.  What do we get off the air about what?  Seven twenty five, seven thirty yesterday.  Uh, yeah, something like that.  So Carol's on after us.  Yeah. 
[02:30]
 And she's waiting outside because she's not really allowed in here when we're in here.  No, on the air, because she was told to wait till we leave the studio and I was allowed  to come in.  There's a little friction between Opie and Carol usually.  Yeah.  And and a general underlying friction between the show as a whole being Opie and Anthony  and Carol.  She just doesn't get our show at this point.  She really has a problem with Opie.  Yeah.  She called me a meathead, I guess.  Yeah.  That everyone see she she can't help herself.  She runs around and talks about me.  Yeah. 
[03:00]
 She runs into everyone's office and the latest is I'm a meathead.  Yeah.  So now yesterday, and she also thinks we're klepto.  So, you know, Sunday when we throw the Super Bowl party at one of our listeners house,  she's telling everyone, you know, you better not win because Opie and Anthony will steal  stuff from your play.  I might steal something from the house.  So I guess she's trying to have some fun with us.  So we'll have fun with her back.  Yeah, it's all about fun.  So then yesterday she comes in here and she unloads on me.  And I know she hates Opie. 
[03:30]
 She lets you have it.  But then she let me have it.  See, we have a lot of newspapers around the studio.  They're spread out all over the console here.  I bring in my four newspapers.  I have my little area right here, little things that I clean up when I'm done with.  Mm hmm. And I was just getting up.  Laura Korn was leaving the studio and the cow just unloaded  clean up this mess.  I deserve a little more respect than this. 
[04:00]
 This is a mess in here.  Thank you, Carol.  We're just walking out.  I mean, we're just finishing up every time I come in here.  It's a mess every time I come in here.  How am I supposed to see?  How am I supposed to see any drunk point at me and tell me when I'm supposed to talk  newspapers all over the place?  How am I supposed to intro the next Led Zeppelin song and say W.  Do we need to do with all these newspapers?  Mike, oh, my God, she's ragging me. 
[04:30]
 She just lost it on you.  She got all pissed and she's now she's given Laura Korn crap.  Yeah, our guest, our special guest, our favorite guest.  And we were still in the process of leaving like Rick hadn't even come in to clean  everything up yet or anything.  You know, we were just getting everything out of the way from running late.  And she unloaded. I don't have to walk into this.  So she she just gave us hell.  Gave you hell because he doesn't acknowledge me anymore. 
[05:00]
 No, no. So, um, she's all mad at me now, too.  But she needs a lot of area for her show prep.  What is her show prep?  IQs. What is her show prep?  Really? But Eddie has to point at me and I have to go into the diva.  That's what she does, gang. We're just telling it like we see it.  She has someone run the whole damn board, play the music and everything.  And this poor sat Eddie, who's but who's known in the in this city 
[05:30]
 for being a rock and roll DJ, has to point to her to tell her when to talk.  I mean, you know, if that's what you do, I'm fine.  But she just gives us hell.  Like, do you need a clean area to do that?  And she acts like she needs all this counter space to prepare her breaks or something.  I can't see when you do things.  Piled up. You people are in here annoying me. 
[06:00]
 I can't get the lid out.  And then she's all pissed because Laura Korn was using her mic.  She was, yeah, is this girl all naked using my mic?  Naked. Listen to our show.  It had nothing about some slut hanging out with Opi and Anthony.  We learned a lot about sex yesterday.  It was months ago.  That was a month ago. I was sitting on your chair.  So there you go.  Yeah, she was a little annoyed yesterday.  I knew for once.  I don't know. I thought she liked me.  Hated you. But I guess now she tells everyone that she really, you know, 
[06:30]
 she doesn't mind you that I'm the problem.  Yeah. So you're the Antichrist.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.  OK, well, I guess we'll be back after this.  And what it is, have a W.  Did it.  All right. We're a rock facts like two, one, two, nine, five, seven W.  Any W.  Request line two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, two, seven.  The Rock of New York, one of two, seven W.  Any W. Collective soul from dosage that heavy. 
[07:00]
 It's opiate, Anthony. Hey.  And we're getting so busy already.  I forgot to tell you what song to listen for this hour.  Later this hour, when you hear all along the watchtower by Hendrix,  be the tenth caller to win a fifty dollar multi sport passport to Chelsea Piers.  And you'll qualify to have a Super Bowl party at your house.  We're doing that Sunday.  God help us. We're a little scared about this concept.  They came up with down the hall, but we're going with it.  We're just hoping we we get to go to a cool listeners house. 
[07:30]
 I mean, sitting there watching the game, all of a sudden, the cops bust in  because I'm sitting on two kilos of coke.  Oh, we didn't tell you.  Yeah. Opiate, Anthony brought it, man. Yeah. Yeah.  Some husband comes over  because we're at his girl's house.  These are the guys.  Oh, plenty of nightmares can happen.  Well, we can't back out now.  This Sunday, we will be at one of our listeners houses with a fifty three inch 
[08:00]
 Sony projection screen TV watching the big game.  The Super Bowl, the big game.  Did I say the big game?  The Super Bowl missing for like a week.  Stuck in the basement of some house,  chained up while some guy goes, bring out the game.  Oh, I'll be this is a great idea.  Why? I know you can't talk up.  You got the rubber red ball in your mouth. 
[08:30]
 This could be the wackiest thing we've ever done.  In our radio careers.  I hope we're hope we're OK.  I think we'll do just fine. Yeah.  We got a lady on the line here.  She got really hot and worked up over our show last night, Anthony.  Oh, we had Laura Cornyn, our favorite sex expert.  And I don't think many people turned off the radio yesterday.  Very hard to turn off.  That's the impression we're getting through the instant feedback,  your email and the faxes and the phone calls.  But this girl was so worked up, she ran to Bars and Noble to get the book. 
[09:00]
 So let's talk to her, see what she's all about.  Hi, who's this? It's Carrie.  Carrie, I heard you got really worked up listening to us last night.  Oh, yeah. Car ride home.  There we go.  And then I get home, have the guy turning on, listen to it.  We hopped in the car, went to Barnes and Noble and bought the book.  Get out of here. No joke.  Did you try any of the techniques in the book?  Oh, yeah, we tried the velvet tongue, whichever one.  I think that was it. Number five.  That's one of our famous ones, the velvet tongue, the honey and herbal tea.  So you guys are driving to the bookstore, you're all worked up and everything. 
[09:30]
 Of course. All tingly.  Of course. Not only checking out Laura Korn's book,  but all the other ones that were there, too. Very cool.  Now, so did you guys get off last night? Of course.  Well, he got off more than I did. Was he really into it?  Yeah, more than usual. Definitely.  Now explain the velvet tongue, because this is one of her better techniques.  OK, you got to get herbal tea, honey and naked man.  That's how she describes it in the book.  All right. Now be careful. I explain it. 
[10:00]
 OK, and then you have to heat up the tea, whatnot, put the honey in the tea  and then just start from the top on a man's face and work his way right down  and start doing the hummer thing.  Right. You have to keep drinking the tea throughout the whole thing  to make sure your mouth hot.  Oh, and then if you want, add a little honey to his part of the part.  However you want to word it.  Hot and smooth. Exactly.  And he just went stimulating, he says. 
[10:30]
 He went nuts. He went absolutely nuts.  No, it also works out here.  I hear because I know Anthony's ready to pop in here.  You alternate between the warm tea and like a cold liquid.  Hey, I'll try that next time. All right.  All right. But it worked for you.  It did. Awesome.  Thank you very much, guys.  All right. I'm glad we can help.  Yeah. Now you guys are officially members of the Tuesday Night  Hummer Club, too, I guess.  Was that the first time for that?  It was the first time I've ever been listening to you guys.  I was like, oh, I just got introduced to you guys 
[11:00]
 because I moved into a new office and the guy I'm rooming with  listens to you guys constantly.  Oh, we're doing this type of stuff every day.  Pass the word for us.  Now we're always listening.  All right. Thank you.  Thanks a lot. You guys.  All right. Bye.  Yeah, we're going to get the word out on this damn radio show.  First time she listened.  That pains me.  I know. God, you'd hope people have been listening for a while.  You'll get that big reaction.  Mm hmm.  Oh, well, that's OK. 
[11:30]
 They're coming aboard.  I'll be slowly but surely. Yes.  We're building our little army. Yes.  All right.  We're getting lots of requests for Stephen Lynch songs today.  Oh, wow. Look at this. It's Opie.  It's Anthony and it's Carol Miller in the studio with us. Wow.  Hi, Carol. How are you?  Want to intro the next record for us?  Make nice with us.  Are you going to let her into the next record?  Yeah. Give her that mic over there.  OK. All right, Carol, whenever you're ready.  Then the problem,  the problem, the problem, the problem, the problem, the problem, the problem. 
[12:00]
 A little bit of a bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little, a little bit of a bit, a little bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a, a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit  of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit, a little bit of a little bit of a introduction to the video.  to the dumpling but forget it.  We'll do it ourselves.  What do you seven W like you do?  all along the watchtower at Soapy and Anthony. That was the song you had to be  listening for this hour. To qualify to have a Super Bowl party at your house  where we bring the 53-inch Sony projection screen TV and I think we have  the winner on the line here. Hi, N.A.W. 
[12:30]
 Yeah, this is John from Queens.  Hey, John, what's going on?  You know, man, you guys have respect.  Hey, thanks. You're our latest qualifier.  Oh, great, man. Every time I go to my second job,  my first job's NIPB. I don't make enough money over there, so I got to run two jobs,  confident as a man. Now, this is you guys all the time, man. You guys are the best.  Hey, thank you very much. We'll just spread the word, you know?  Excellent, no problem.  And make sure all your pals realize that we don't support cop killers here at N.A.W.  Excellent. You guys are the best, so I'll keep it up.  All right, hold on the line. You have won the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea 
[13:00]
 Piers and now you're qualified to have a Super Bowl party at your house. That  means Anthony and I would come over your house with this 53-inch screen TV from Sony  and we would just have a blast. So good luck on that, okay?  Excellent. Thanks, guys.  All right, man. Cool. Nice guy.  Man.  All right. Good deal. I got Stephen Lynch all queued up and ready to go here. People  can't get enough of our pal, Stephen Lynch, another fine guest on our radio show.  Jen doesn't like this song. 
[13:30]
 Jen doesn't like... Why?  Well, she's, you know, likes cats.  Well, I got cats.  Kittens and everything.  I got cats. You got cats.  There's still some humor in this, I believe.  It's that simple.  Just log on to www.com.  And cute little spot you did there.  Why?  Come on, let me hear it one time live, please.  $5,000.  I'm a hack.  How many takes did you have to do?  Come on, that was one. 
[14:00]
 One take. One take, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  That's cute.  Look at that spot.  Oh, no.  Ah, we're having fun today.  The Rock of New York, 1027, W-A-D-W.  Checking out another track from Up. That's R.E.M. and Lotus.  It's Opie. It's Anthony.  Hey.  And for this break, we brought in Mark from production because he's brought up some interesting...  Hi there.  ...points about video games.  I must start, though, by saying thank you to Rob David from Morganville, New Jersey. 
[14:30]
 I got into NW today, Anthony, and I opened my mail.  Yeah, I see.  And he sent me the Tomb Raider III Adventures of Lara Croft, All Secrets Exposed.  There's some pictures of Lara in there.  Look how hot she looks.  There's one like she's naked. She's squatting on a chair or something.  Well, that one's pretty good right there.  What a digital wreck.  That's something.  She's the hottest animated creature since Jessica Rabbit. 
[15:00]
 It beats Ms. Pac-Man.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, look, look.  It's all shaded so you can't really see her vitals, but she's looking hot after a hard day of combat.  Yeah, if you're faithful to the show, Anthony and I are pretty much hooked on games.  I got the PlayStation. I'm doing Tomb Raider III.  And Anthony, of course, is the Half-Life master at this point.  Half-Life is my life.  He's a multiplayer online motherhucker. 
[15:30]
 They call it Half-Life, but it should be Full-Life or No-Life.  You spend all your life playing it once you get it.  Well, this is where Mark comes into the discussion from production.  Mark came in and you're losing it. You're addicted or something.  I got this as a Christmas gift.  Now, I've never been a game player.  I've always been into photo design and web page and that sort of thing.  Get the game, play it for a couple hours the first week,  try to get the hang of the keys, the buttons, the moves.  It's four or five hours the second week.  Suddenly I finish the first level, kill off all the aliens, 
[16:00]
 and this is cool.  Suddenly it's gone from a game now to an obsession.  I warned you.  I get home late, I talk to my wife for a couple of seconds,  the computer boots up,  play it until I go to sleep, wake up in the morning,  because I've thought about it now for six hours and sleeping,  play it for that half hour, I can catch another train. 
[16:30]
 I don't have to be to work on time.  You read that crossover point.  But you're still getting sleep, right?  Very little bit.  Well, at least you're still sleeping.  It's in 3D now.  And while you're away from the game, all you're thinking about is the game.  How to make that move.  How can I do this? I've got to get up the ladder and onto the elevator.  Every half page website, every cheat sheet, don't want to do that.  Cheat? 
[17:00]
 Well, I've got the cheat manual.  I might have to take a peek.  All day long, I'm like, if I jump from the ledge to the other ledge with the cobra,  if I grasp onto the end of the ledge and then shimmy over,  then I might have a shot at killing the cobra  before he knocks me back down into the waterfall area.  That's all I think about.  You were talking about this around Christmas time.  How can somebody be so obsessed?  Oh, don't even, don't even.  Suddenly something snaps in the back of your brain.  It does.  What do you think about? 
[17:30]
 You're fully immersed into this simulation.  It's crazy.  You've gotten past some of the aliens.  Have you gotten to some of the grunts?  No, not yet.  The armed grunts?  No.  I just realized that I am nowhere in the game level.  It's all real cute.  You're in Black Mesa Research Facility.  And some experiment goes awry,  and these aliens transport over into your dimension.  And you're killing these aliens  and you've got to help these scientists  and there's some security people that help you.  It's all very fine and well. 
[18:00]
 And then the army arrives,  and to my dismay, I think they're going to help me  kill some of the aliens.  It's like, the scientist is like,  oh, the military has arrived, you know,  as I laid a crowbar over his head.  And then I see the army.  It's like, oh good, hey guys, hey.  There, there, wait till you see them.  They're there to make sure no one leaves the place.  It's a very well designed game.  Oh my God, it's amazing.  It's funny, you said it all though.  It starts out as a game,  and it turns into an obsession where you're like,  you know, I think I can survive on two hours sleep. 
[18:30]
 You know, I don't need to eat breakfast this morning  or brush my teeth.  Constant battle.  I think I could take the 840 train  and be just maybe 20 minutes late for work.  Yeah.  It's a rip.  Well, God bless you.  I hope you make it through.  Did you get the cobra yet?  No, I had to do this to myself.  I haven't played the game in three days  because I was really obsessed.  My mind was racing at night.  I'm walking down my hallway going,  wow, check this out, man, 3D. 
[19:00]
 My visual senses are so sharp right now.  I was like, check out the table, man, it's in 3D.  Look how easy I could turn my head  and look into the bathroom.  You see me down the hallway.  Yeah.  My wife is thanking Bill Gates from Microsoft.  I'm a big fan of Bill Gates.  I'm a big fan of Bill Gates.  I haven't been able to play my Half-Life game  since I tried to boot up Windows 98  on my desktop at home.  It went into the laptop here.  I put it at home.  I got no sound. 
[19:30]
 There's no conflicts of resources.  There's no problem with the drivers.  For some reason, no sound.  I don't get a speaker icon in the corner.  That's it.  So now I've got that problem  before I can get back to killing.  I will guarantee everyone  that I will get a new computer by  January 27th.  You're not making it to Valentine's Day  with your current computer.  No way in the world.  I don't know how you're going to talk Jennifer into it 
[20:00]
 but I think a new computer  is going to be arriving at Anthony's house very soon.  350 mic.  That's what she wants for Valentine's Day.  I know what Jen wants.  Sure.  We both want a hard drive.  Yeah.  Dirty girl.  Well, good luck to you.  Your marriage is really going to get strained.  I see that already.  It's a great observation.  I came in here Monday.  I had no idea what happened in the world. 
[20:30]
 I did not turn on the TV for news or anything.  A little hint for you.  When you get to the tentacle pit, crawl.  He can't hear you if you crawl.  Do I keep the TV on?  Yeah.  And the radio.  I've got the game, I've got the TV.  I get all my info on my news.  See, that's the problem with PlayStation.  I have to get up the TV to play my game.  Didn't it kind of creep you out?  Didn't it creep you out?  Like the first couple of nights you played going to bed  you felt like, I don't know, 
[21:00]
 I felt all creeped out at the game.  It gives you this whole atmosphere  that you almost feel bad.  It's just too real.  It really is bad, yeah.  What happened to the cute Mario Brothers game?  I thought it was going to be fun to shoot one of the scientists.  So I clip him in the leg.  And he runs away all scared.  He's like, oh my me!  And he's running off and I felt like, hey wait, I'm sorry.  It really felt bad.  Hey, what do you got man?  On your, uh, 
[21:30]
 Anthony to go to his control panel and systems.  He can remove his present sound card configuration.  We run the auto setup  and it will reconfigure it.  Really? Yeah.  He tried it.  Did you really? Yeah.  I got one of these damn packard bells  with the wind modems with the sound card on the modem card.  Oh, it sucks.  It's an old model.  I'm going to gut it with a spade shovel.  I'm going to replace all the cards with a sledgehammer.  And it will tell you it's no conflict.  Meanwhile, you're damn well sitting there 
[22:00]
 knowing there's a conflict.  There's a game I can't play.  I'm in conflict.  You can try by looking for a new modem.  Select a generic modem and try to reselect the sound card.  Thank you Mr. Wizard.  Good luck.  One more real fast.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  I was listening about the sound card.  I had the same problem when I went from  Windows 3.1 to Win 95 lost my sound.  It turned out that I needed a new sound card  because it didn't recognize the sound driver. 
[22:30]
 Yeah, that figures.  So I had to get a brand new one loaded up  and I had to go to the sound driver.  I had to get a brand new one loaded up.  I took out the old one and put the new one in.  Two seconds later,  I got the sound speaker on the bottom  and no problem after that.  I don't know if you need a new sound card  because it's not recognizing.  Maybe that's it.  Oh well, thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you for participating.  We're taking all the calls here on Computer Show 
[23:00]
 with Opie and Anthony.  Hi, my name is Dennis from Coca-Cola  driving the big rig. Your wife says hi.  She also says you'll be a member of the  Tuesday Night Hummer Club in the very near future.  Oh yeah.  We're giving personal messages.  1027WNW, the Rock of New York.  The latest from the Goo Goo Dolls.  Off Dizzy Up the Girl, that slide.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, once again,  welcome all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[23:30]
 Yeah.  They like to check in on Wednesdays and brag.  I think Wednesdays are a better day than Tuesday  because a lot of people  join the club on Tuesday, but then  on Wednesday they need to brag.  Well, that's how guys are, of course.  Well, I got a  fax from a lady that wants to brag.  She does? Yes.  I like that.  Says, Dear Opie and Anthony, Hummer Club member announcement.  First, I just want to let you know that I think it's a shame  that the men out there are not being  orally gratified more often. 
[24:00]
 Well, we'll agree.  I think that's the only reason I need to  want to savor my boyfriend, Dave.  It was admittedly amusing, however,  as I was strategically  positioning myself over him last night  to suddenly be able to say,  honey, welcome to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Oh, man.  I was hooched enough,  as it was,  by making sure he was being  in front of a mirror.  But to also be a member of  a, wait, 
[24:30]
 but to also be a Hummer Club member maker  was a bonus. I always look forward  to hearing the personal recap your listeners  provide on the Wednesday drive home. Hint,  we're usually listening from 4.30 to  5. Kudos to both of you.  Love your show. Keep it up. Some  pun intended. Sincerely, T.  The mirror thing's  cool if you don't have to look at your  face, you know?  Like, occasionally you look over  and get a different perspective on things,  but if you don't want to see your face going  bad, 
[25:00]
 making all those dopey faces,  yeah, you got to see yourself  making the orgasm faces,  making the faces of love.  You ever just look at  your wife or girlfriend  and just start laughing?  No, that is not the right thing to do.  Well, the faces we make  in the moment,  it's just damn funny  if you  if you take a step back and just look at the face  that is being made, it's pretty damn funny sometimes.  The whole 
[25:30]
 package looks pretty silly  when you really get down to it.  But yeah, the faces  are not ones you want other people  really seeing and remembering.  No, of course not.  Well, yesterday,  everyone was talking about Laura Korn  and her lovely advice that she gave  everyone. And  we're going to give away one of her secrets today  because you guys are begging for it.  If you were listening yesterday, we had a couple  that Laura Korn talked to  off the air. 
[26:00]
 Laura gave this couple  one of her techniques from her new book.  The couple tried it out.  And what happened Anthony?  When we talked to them after they did it,  the guy was completely exhausted  and just  in that whole  post-orgasmic haze,  he wasn't even coherent.  And the girl  was just a giggling happy gal  that she made her man feel so good.  It was great.  It was very great. And then we asked the guy 
[26:30]
 if it was the best one he ever had.  And he said, without a doubt,  it was. It's called  Stand Back. I don't know how  big this damn thing is going to get.  Now, I don't even know what this is.  I don't even know what this is yet.  Anthony, I haven't even opened it yet.  I know. I haven't read it. I don't know.  She wouldn't tell us.  We're going to give away the secret, but we need you guys to listen a little longer. That's all.  That's all we ask from our little radio show.  And you might have a friend that was listening yesterday  and you guys have discussed, 
[27:00]
 man, what did that girl do to the guy?  At this moment in time, it would be cool  to call that friend  and tell him to listen to the radio because we're giving away the secret  in the five o'clock hour.  Okay? All right.  I think that's cool. And we're still trying to find out what the whole  blue balloon thing was all about.  We're going to try to find that as well  and give you that one.  I don't think I got that one, Opie.  Well, she kind of explained it, but not really, right?  Yeah, and it's  kind of ridiculous.  Right. I think. 
[27:30]
 All right. Well, we'll get to that in a little while.  Later this hour, when you hear  Aerosmith, Big Ten Inch, Be the Tenth Caller  at 212-757-1027  and you'll be our latest qualifier  to win a Super Bowl  party at your house. That's where  Anthony and I go with a  53-inch Sony TV to your house.  We show up with the beer and the soda  and the food and we watch the game  together. Yeah, we hang out at your house.  Great freeloaders.  Well, we're bringing cool TV  and... Oh, it's going to be great. 
[28:00]
 All we ask though is if you're like a serial killer  or something, please don't participate  in this particular, you know, contest.  There's other  contests out there that you could participate in.  But this one we'd like you to stay away from.  All of a sudden we walk in and it's like  What's the smell in this house?  It smells like dead animal.  Let me show you my  basement. You could help  me dig our next hole.  Yes. We don't want that.  If you deal coke for a living.  Yeah, and you're going to be stashing your kilos 
[28:30]
 under the couch we'll be sitting on  when the cops bust in. Yeah, this is not a contest  for you. Please don't participate.  If you have a hidden room in your  house with that, the mask with the  zipper over the mouth and the red ball  that goes in your mouth and you like  using terms like time to bring out the  game.  Don't invite us over. No, don't  participate in the contest.  NAW radio DJs, Opie and Anthony  disappear after going to a Super Bowl  party. Meanwhile we're in the basement.  BAM! 
[29:00]
 All right.  Yeah.  All right. So stick around, listen  for Aerosmith. And if you got something for the  show, you know what to do. Give us a call.  We're at Aerosmith.access.212957  WNAW.  And we are having a little problem with our  instant feedback on the web.  That is up and running now. Yes.  This is a great feature for you guys.  We got to explain this again because we are getting new listeners every day.  If you're online, you go to the WNAW  website and click on  Opie and Anthony, our pictures. 
[29:30]
 And there's a section there where you could just  knock off an email right to the studio  and we're reading them as we're on the air.  That's a great way to contribute.  That just rocks.  Isn't that great?  Who hooked us up with that website?  BAM!  It's  naked Lara Croft  from Tomb Raider 3.  We found the website.  I can't play the game the same now.  Naked computerized  girl. 
[30:00]
 Digital chick. There's nothing better.  1027 WNAW  The Rock of New York. Everlast.  That's what I always like.  And Aerosmith before that big 10 inch, that was the song  you had to be listening for to qualify for the  Super Bowl party at your house.  And Rick, who's this hour's winner?  This hour, Chris  Brazite from Babylon.  Congratulations Chris. You're in the running now  for the party at your house.  Anthony and I possibly going to your  house with a truck full of beer and soda.  We're going to bring the 53 inch 
[30:30]
 Sony big screen projection TV and we're going to have a  blast.  We're going to see the Super Bowl.  Correct. And I think we're going to draw the winner on Friday.  I would assume? Yes.  Okay, very good. On the way  we are going to give away the technique from yesterday's show.  We are reading up on it now.  Making sure that  we read this right.  Because there's a lot of tricky language involved  with this technique.  It was a technique that the  couple did on the show. 
[31:00]
 When Lara Corne was visiting us  yesterday, the guy got back on the phone  and said, not only was it the best  one he ever had, it was  absolutely incredible.  And his memory got really, really  huge.  So we're going over that next.  And next time we talk we'll  give that away.  We might have a celebrity  do it. Maybe we'll invite  William Shatner. 
[31:30]
 Or the Dice Man.  Someone's got to read it for us.  And speaking of the  Super Bowl, Anthony, I dug up  a little ditty from the Opium Anthony  archives.  What do you got?  I got one of our Super Bowl pranks.  These were  brutal. Green Bay.  When the Packers were  in the Super Bowl, we called up  Green Bay. Green Bay.  We made believe we were a TV station.  We got a schmuck on the phone 
[32:00]
 and made him do some silly things  thinking that he was going to win  Super Bowl tickets if he did all this stuff  for us. I didn't know they had this ridiculous  accent. Yeah, they got the Fargo  accent. Yeah, it's like Fargo, eh?  Margie. Margie.  1027WNEW  The Rock of New  York. Pink Floyd on the turning away.  Days in the New Before That,  the downtown. It's  Opium Anthony for your ride home. Hey,  thanks for checking us out again. We definitely, definitely,  definitely appreciate it. 
[32:30]
 Thanks for all the feedback.  You guys are great.  Seems like  the tides are changing a little bit, Anthony.  Yes. We're starting to feel a little love with  our radio show. Well, don't get carried away.  I said a little.  The first seven months there was a lot of  hate in the air, but  seems like there's a bunch of people that are  starting to dig the show a little bit and  we just want to acknowledge you.  Alright. Well, yeah, it's just a  it just takes a little time to  get used to it. It's an acquired taste. 
[33:00]
 We'll be the first to admit that.  Alright.  Where do we begin, Anthony?  Oh my goodness. Yesterday we  had Laura Korn in the studio.  She's our favorite guest of all time. We've  been doing radio together,  you and I, for five years. We've had Laura Korn  on, I don't know, five or six times. She's a  sexpert. Sexpert, we like to call her.  Yeah, she comes up with these new, innovative  ways of having sex with your  favorite partner.  Usually it's something a little out  of the ordinary, maybe. 
[33:30]
 A trick that's interesting.  Something that feels real good.  Spontaneity, things like that.  She's great at spicing up relationships.  Instead of the same old thing over and over again,  she comes up with new and inventive  ways to do the nasty,  basically. Her latest book is  52 Invitations to Great Sex.  She just was  absolutely wild yesterday.  I told her book, by the way, a lot of people  standing by for the number, it's  1-800-547-B-O-N-K.  1-800-547-BONK. 
[34:00]
 Now, if you were  listening yesterday on the show,  she took a couple  aside off the radio  and described one of  the techniques that you can find in her latest  book to this couple.  Then we checked in with the couple a half hour later.  The guy could barely speak.  The girl was happy, the guy was happy.  He said it was the best orgasm he's ever had.  The best hummer he's ever had.  Not amazing.  Just happened to be on Tuesday night.  They became members of the Tuesday night Hummer Club. 
[34:30]
 Everyone after  the couple left the show  were freaking out, wondering  what this girl did to this guy  to get this  type of reaction.  Now, Laura, I understand,  she needed to sell some books, so she  didn't want to give the  trick away.  She leaves in a mystery.  We have a feeling that we probably sold Laura  about 10,000 books yesterday.  Our listeners are important to us, so we're going to tell.  We need to give a little back to our listeners 
[35:00]
 for sticking by us.  I've got the technique in my hand here, Anthony.  We're going to read it.  To the ladies.  Now, there's a lot of language in this  that could get us thrown off the radio.  Remember that old game  Adlib?  Was it Adlib? Madlib.  Madlibs.  We need to come up with another name for penis.  Alright.  I could come up with one, I guess.  Alright, what do you got?  I'll just read. 
[35:30]
 You'll come up with it?  Alright, here's the technique from yesterday's show.  Your invitation, ladies, is quite  mysterious this week.  You're asking your lover to bring a tie and a tray to the bedroom.  Alright.  Set them aside at first. You won't need them for the long kisses  and mutual striptease that begin your evening.  Ha ha ha ha.  Just kidding.  Well, once you've both warmed up,  ask him to turn around while you  blindfold him with the necktie.  Sure, men are visual creatures. 
[36:00]
 They like to see you having sex.  But this time, you don't want anything to distract  from the rather intense physical sensations  you have in store.  And you don't want him to know when they're coming.  Uh oh.  Have him lay on his back and place the tray in the bed next to him.  Go to the kitchen for your secret ingredients,  hot and cold.  Aha.  That is a mug of tea or some other hot liquid  and ice cubes swimming in a glass of water.  Put them on the tray.  Now, play with his  snuffle-luffagus 
[36:30]
 and his mind.  That's the word you came up with?  Well, yeah.  That's cute.  Squeeze his  snuffle-luffagus.  Draw his  snuffle-luffagus into your mouth.  Tease it the way you might on any other night.  Then invoke the magic of the velvet tongue.  Take a sip of hot tea  and let the warmth flood your mouth.  Don't swallow it at all.  Try to hold a bit of steamy liquid as you plunge your lips past the  snuffle-luffagus 
[37:00]
 of his trembling  erection.  Oh, a scythe escapes from your lover  as the unexpected warmth envelops his most tender part,  his  snuffle-luffagus.  Like a flame under a kettle, the few minutes of added heat  brings him to a simmer.  But before he can boil over,  pop a half-melted ice cube in your mouth  and dive back down the length of his  snuffle-luffagus.  His entire body will twitch with the shock.  He'll gasp at his  as his want-want rise off the bed. 
[37:30]
 Let his buttocks  rise off the bed.  Just a few seconds is all you need,  and probably all he can take before you switch back to your  overheated mouth.  This battle can go on for quite a long while.  The warmth draws blood to the surface.  Swelling has already engorged  the snuffle-luffagus that shall keep him from coming  to your aid  and helping you with  making more tea.  Exactly, that's what I meant to say. 
[38:00]
 The control,  all this to say, is all yours.  The pressure will build through several cycles  of this exquisite torture until he's ready to  want-want, and want-want.  This, of course, is the exact opposite  of the condition for which those boys needed a cold shower.  They used to call it blue balls.  Remember? Well, I have a name for this kind of  explosive superorgasm, snowballs.  Ho-ho-ho.  Frosty had them too, which just explains why  he was such a jolly, happy soul.  So there you go. There's the technique.  It's a hummer 
[38:30]
 where the girl uses hot tea or something  and alternates with cold ice,  like ice cubes in water.  And you're blindfolded.  That adds to the sensation.  The tie.  Blindfolded part.  Alright, there you go.  Give that one a try.  That was what all the hype was about yesterday.  I wonder how many people are racing home right now to try that.  Try that out.  If you try it before seven, please give us a call.  The Rock of New York, Metallica. 
[39:00]
 Turn the page from Garage Inc.  and Van Halen 2. It's Hope and Anthony.  Hey! And look who has entered  the studio here.  Ben the Fag. Ben the Fag has made it  back into the studio.  What's up, Ben?  Nothing.  We were looking for you.  Now listen.  Before your boss Roger gets mad,  we forced you into the studio.  I'm hearing rumors you're not allowed on our show anymore.  I told Rick to ask permission.  You have to ask permission to come into the studio? 
[39:30]
 Well, I don't need to.  The people we like to have in here  aren't allowed in here.  And then other people  that come in here and annoy us  just walk in.  Don't take that personally.  But we have fun with Ben the Fag.  Because he just puts his foot in his mouth all the time.  You might remember Ben was in here  about a month and a half ago  just relating a cute little story  how he was hanging out with 
[40:00]
 guys that he thought were girls.  They were transvestites.  Transsexuals.  How do you know?  How do you know they were transvestites or transsexuals  if you said you didn't get their pants off?  They had boots.  You ever seen the chicks with...  You're a mess, man.  So he says that every guy  was looking at him as he was leaving this bar  with these three girls  saying, wow, look at that guy leaving with the three hot chicks.  Meanwhile, we all know they're looking going 
[40:30]
 look at the guy leaving with three guys.  Just like a girl.  And this was after our Christmas party  and Ben was very liquored up.  Very horned up.  And you finally figured out they were guys  when the guy was stroking your leg.  About an hour into that.  That was when we went to the second bar.  And then you guys were making out or something.  Raise your stumble.  Come on, man.  Well, now I get emails from fans  that have heard me on the show.  They're emailing me here. 
[41:00]
 Well, Ben the Fag, supposedly is actually not gay.  It's a horrible nickname you have.  He's got the whole  thing floating around him.  He insists he's not gay.  His lifestyle that he tells us about  isn't a gay lifestyle.  He's out with girls all the time.  He brags about all the girls he's bagging.  We haven't seen any.  He says he does.  So we just call him Ben the Fag.  He does live in the village.  But you have to say what that means.  There's a lot of straight people that live in the village. 
[41:30]
 Of course.  And he goes to questionable bars.  Which brings us to what he said the other day in the office.  He's talking about a bar.  Do you remember the name of the bar?  The tunnel, I believe.  We were talking about the tunnel again because a kid had died there.  We were bringing that up.  I said Ben, is that a gay bar?  And Ben goes,  no, it's only about half gay.  Now,  I don't know, check me here.  But if half the crowd is gay to me,  that's a gay bar. 
[42:00]
 Like the bars I go to,  I wouldn't say maybe  99.9%  is straight, but it's pretty close.  You know?  Let's bring the percentages down too.  If 10% of the people  in a bar are gay, I would call that a gay bar.  Yeah.  And they say 10% of the population  is gay. Sure.  Alright, so 11% then. 11% gay bar.  Right?  Because now you're over the standard for humanity.  So Ben goes, no, it's not a gay bar 
[42:30]
 because only 50% of the people in it  are gay.  50%!  And that isn't a gay bar?  Once again, Ben the fag  His foot is not.  But I guess his foot is better than other things that could be there.  Exactly.  It's like I said, I got all these things  going against me. I live downtown.  I used to work on another  different radio station.  Yeah, he worked with a jock  that is known to be 
[43:00]
 Rome the gay.  No, he worked with a guy that  is gay.  He's on New York's radio  and he pretends to be  straight.  I hate people who do that, but whatever.  That'll get you thinking, won't it?  Another phony on the radio.  Pretend we like girls. And you worked for this guy?  Yes, I did.  Did he used to like, you know,  Oh, you're Ben.  Oh, look, I dropped a card.  Again, could you bend over and pick that up? 
[43:30]
 My friends forget about it  but he never hit on you.  Never hit on you.  Maybe he just likes straight guys.  So listen,  you're in this bar,  it's 50% gay, but to you  it's a straight club.  And then he tries to  abuse Anthony and I by saying  what?  I don't remember what I said. I called you guys old farts.  Old farts because we're not going  to a place that's 50% gay. 
[44:00]
 Yeah, because he's clubbing. He knows the scene.  He's trying to tell us, that's the scene.  50% gay, I guess, is the scene.  And he's like, what do you old farts know?  Yeah, that's it.  Because we're old, you darn kids.  Well, if that's what it takes, I'll just  stick to sucking on some  Puski. Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you, Popeye.  That's what it means to be old, you know?  Boy, I'm old. I just don't know  about kids these days, you know?  I guess you all like, you know, 
[44:30]
 one in the keister.  I don't know. I guess I'm old.  I don't know what's happening with young guys  like you, Ben, in your early 20s.  And then Ben has to say that  the gay clubs are the  places that have the best music.  What?  You've never heard that before when you bring a group of girls  to a... Here it is.  I just repeat that all night long. 
[45:00]
 And you have the mating call  of the home-all.  That's the music?  Yeah, that's it.  Are you one of those guys that comes up with excuses?  You're in this so-called straight club where half the  place is gay, and then next thing you know you're on  the dance floor dancing with guys and you don't know how that  happened? I don't know. I was just  into it and dancing. I was just  sitting there, you know, minding my own business,  you know, drinking my screwdriver. 
[45:30]
 Next thing I know I'm on the dance floor  with a gay guy dancing.  All of a sudden I'm drinking my Cosmopolitan.  And then I'm  dancing with a guy, but it's okay because I'm not gay.  But I'm dancing with him and we're  dancing. So on the ride back to his  place, I'm just saying I'm not gay.  You know? So we're laying in  bed and I'm smoking a butt,  but I'm not gay, and it's his butt.  Well, you know, I will  remind you of the fact that way back when 
[46:00]
 with the transsexuals...  I don't dance,  but my friend that was with me was like getting  down with the transsexuals.  He was getting down like, you know,  getting down with them. I was sitting  there. You had your hand  on his leg. I know. They had their hand  on my leg. And you didn't do anything?  I swear. And you  thought it was a girl? I did.  You mean to tell me if a girl is at a bar  with you rubbing your leg for 40 minutes,  you won't make a move, but you're this guy who's  always getting laid? It doesn't 
[46:30]
 make sense. You obviously did something  with this thing. I did not.  You rubbed the leg. You didn't feel the calluses on  the hand? I have a witness  that's been proven. A big Vienna  sausage fingers you couldn't tell?  Writing down his number on the back of a Teamsters  card didn't tip you off  maybe?  We just find  this shocking, man. Shocking?  Yes. Oh, the phones.  Here we go. Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, Ben. 
[47:00]
 Dang it.  Ben, we're not saying that we will look at you  any different. I don't care.  We don't care that you're gay.  If you need to confess,  just confess it on our show.  But this whole thing how he's always going out with 
[47:30]
 chicks and stuff. I am.  We don't see it. Hey, dude, you still there?  I'm still here.  I just need to ask you something.  You're in a club or a bar  and 50% of the...  I work in the club, as a matter of fact.  50% of the people in the club  are gay. Do you call that a straight club or a gay club?  I call me getting the hell out of there.  That's a gay bar.  When you went there, did you go in through the back door? 
[48:00]
 The one at the  Basia Bronco promotion  when you guys introduced me at the very end.  That one guy that wanted to kick my ass  because he was like,  hey, it's Ben the fag.  There are people who  aren't very open-minded.  I'm like you guys.  It's just a tragic nickname. I thought Opie was a stupid nickname  but having Ben the fag I think is worse.  Especially if indeed you are a  straight guy. Having the nickname 
[48:30]
 Ben the fag is kind of tragic.  Hey, what do you got, man?  Is this the baloney bandit Rump Ranger hotline?  What do you got for Ben?  I was just curious. Did he wear his belt  real tight and was there somebody in the bathroom  to help him wash up afterwards?  Were there four guys sitting on a bar stool?  Yeah, that's how Ben knew  he was in the gay bar when he walked  up to the bar and a guy asked if he could push in his 
[49:00]
 stool for him.  Alright, Ben.  Everybody wants  to talk to you but we've got to take a break.  I'll probably get more emails.  Can you stick around for more abuse, Ben?  Or do you have to go somewhere?  I'm busy preparing these Super Bowl parties for you guys  I'm busy preparing these gay bars.  50% gay.  Jukebox is all Judy Garland and Bette Midler.  It's not a gay bar.  Sure. Even Black Girl is shaking his head at you. 
[49:30]
 So we left that place and went to the mine shaft.  I can prove the fact that I am straight.  I'll figure that out.  When we were having sex the other night.  He didn't seem interested.  Now, Black Girl.  How can you prove that Ben the Fag  is actually straight?  I've actually seen him with women.  These are not these women that he thinks are women.  I've seen him in action.  Really? 
[50:00]
 Making the moves.  That could just be a beard.  He's trying to come across like he's straight.  Look at me, I'm with a girl.  We're still taking your word for it.  You keep coming up with these wacky things like this.  We're just going to tie any double-w.  Hey Ben.  If you were gay, would you be on the receiving end?  I've been down at the tunnel, man.  It's crazy.  You've been to the tunnel. 
[50:30]
 It's half gay.  Is it a gay bar or a straight club?  It's 50-50.  It's a gay bar.  It's a gay bar.  It's a gay bar.  Some of the women are hot down there.  You've got to be careful.  Watch that Adam's apple moving up and down.  Hi.  It's good.  You have a good time.  You've got to watch yourself down there.  And the girls with the names that could easily have been changed  from the guy names? 
[51:00]
 I'm Jackie.  Pauline is my name.  Pauline.  Anyway, guys, keep rocking.  Alright, thanks.  Bye.  Thanks for my abuse.  A cute little story.  We're going to play the  Hemaphrodite song for Ben, but we're running really late.  We'll play it.  We'll play it in a little while.  One of Stephen Lynch's songs that I think is Ben's theme song.  Point.  One, two, seven, double-w, n-e-w 
[51:30]
 with the Rock of New York Black Crows  from By Your Side.  Only a fool.  We'll play Black Crows at the Beacon on the 25th of February  and the 27th of February.  Those shows are sold out.  We will have some tickets in the coming weeks.  And I believe there are tickets still available  for the show on the 28th  at the Beacon Theater.  Only a fool.  We just had Ben the Fag in the studio.  And we wanted to play  the Stephen Lynch song, Hemaphrodite,  for Ben. 
[52:00]
 Because he gets confused when he sees girls  and boys.  Sometimes he thinks he's with a girl  and actually he's with a man.  He says he's completely 100% straight.  He says he goes out with women.  And that's it.  Never gay.  But I don't know.  Everything he says is contrary.  Yes.  And he's always putting his foot in his mouth.  Correct.  And Stephen Lynch wrote a little ditty here.  And we're getting a lot of people 
[52:30]
 emailing us and faxing us asking  for Stephen Lynch's website.  It's not a website that we've been giving out.  Because we give out his email address  and people are like,  I tried that website you gave me  for Stephen Lynch and it doesn't work.  It's not a website.  It's his email address.  And it's simple. It's pushead.aol.com.  P-U-S-H-E-D-A-O-L-D-O-C-O-P.  You get the newbies  that put that in their browser.  Alright.  www.pushead.aol.com. 
[53:00]
 www.pushead.aol.com.  It's not coming up.  Oh man, we're having so much fun this hour  that, or the five o'clock hour I should say,  that we didn't qualify a person for the  Super Bowl party at your house.  Oh, sorry about that.  And I know a lot of the faithful listeners  are listening right now.  They didn't flip to another stupid station because they heard a commercial.  So let's take care of you right now, man.  Tenth caller  at 212-757-1027  wins a $50 multi-sport passport  to Chelsea Piers, 
[53:30]
 and you'll qualify to have a Super Bowl party  at your house.  We'll draw that winner on Friday afternoon  where Anthony and I show up at your house  with a 53-inch Sony  projection screen TV.  Cool.  1027-W-N-E-W  the Rock of New York Collective Soul.  Let's run off the dosage CD.  It's Opie and Anthony and Rick in the studio.  Now, Rick, who's our latest winner for the  Super Bowl party at their house?  Super Bowl party?  I know. 
[54:00]
 Thinking about Ben?  I was thinking about Ben.  He's going to a Super Bowl party.  All right, Gerald Headland of New York, New York  is the latest winner.  What does he get?  He gets the $50 multi-sport passport  for Chelsea Piers,  which is cool.  And then he's in the running for the Super Bowl.  His name is Headland.  That old gag.  Say hi to Steve and the boys down at the 70th precinct. 
[54:30]
 Yes.  We do not support cop killers here.  No.  We've rehashed that enough, though.  It's just so...  ridiculous.  All right.  Got to get instant feedback here  from Scott from Lynnbrook, Long Island.  Opie and Anthony, my six-year-old  heard your Popeye Pusky routine  last week  and wants to know why Popeye  keeps saying Pusky.  Pup's guy likes Pusky. 
[55:00]
 What's the matter?  Well,  he wants to know  any suggestions as to what to tell him  about his hero.  How old is the Litzko lad?  Six years old.  It's like I told my  Litzko nephews.  When you're close-cut,  you're going to love the Pusky.  Oh,  strong sailor men  love Pusky.  Pusky, Pusky, Pusky. 
[55:30]
 Popeye, we've been over  this a million times.  We've had meetings. You cannot say  Pusky on the radio.  I say Pusky  when I want to say Pusky  because I'm Popeye the Pusky man.  What's the matter?  Are you like Wimpsky?  A Flameskin Homeskoskskowol?  Yeah, you think Whippy is a flaming homosexual.  Of course.  I don't get that one. 
[56:00]
 He's always trolling for free meat.  I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a Briggska today.  That's some kind of lying Yuzkiz.  Yes, yes.  That tries to get meat.  Like Ben the Fag.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ben the Fag doesn't like Pusky.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  That's a massacre, Ben.  I took Skum out of my boat the other day.  All he could talk about was blowfish. 
[56:30]
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Blowfish, blowfish.  Fish was the guy driving the boat.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Well, blow me down.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You're so lense to like Pusky, Ben.  The joys of Pusky.  Ben is speechless, Popeye.  He doesn't know what to say.  What's the matter, Ben?  Never tried the Pusky? 
[57:00]
 It's better than spinach.  Well, any advice for this six-year-old Popeye?  Just sits him down and tells him when he gets colder,  he'll know what Pusky is.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I'm Popeye the Pusky man.  Oh, oh.  Where's me pipe?  There it is. 
[57:30]
 All right.  I'm off to get Olive.  Yeah.  Got a hot date with Olive tonight?  We're married now.  Yeah.  But I still can't leave her alone with that bloot-sco.  What do you mean?  Blooto might come over and try to get a piece of Pusky. 
[58:00]
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  They've been fighting for years over that skinny bitch.  You watch the early cartoons, the late ones, it's always the same.  The whore's always out with Blooto.  I don't understand what you see in Olive Oil myself.  Well, you never seen Skur without her clothes gone.  Thank God.  She's got quite the Pusky.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Now what does her private area look like again?  The sea hag.  Oh. 
[58:30]
 Yeah.  But it works like a sea urchin.  Yeah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Do you ever see a sea urchin when it sticks your finger in it?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh.  That's what the Pusky's like.  Oh.  Very nice.  I always think of things in nautical terms. 
[59:00]
 Did you take care of that odor problem that Olive Oil was in?  Ah, low tide, yeah.  Oh.  She needed some Monskastat 7.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Here, clean it right up.  Smell this freshest sweet pea.  No more probs, Glemsk, with the Pusky.  Okay.  All right.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Are you guys members of the Tuesday Night Live?  Yes. 
[59:30]
 We were Chotska members again last night.  Yeah?  How did it go?  She gave me a hummer.  She did.  But I inadvertently ate some spinach right beforehand.  Shutter right through the hole.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  Oh, that's a good tomsk.  I'm Popeye the Busky Man.  Thank you.

You want to continue with the show today, or you want to just leave at seven? 
[69:30]
 Well, I should have wanted to ruffle any feathers around here.  God forbid.  God forbid we do that.  Everyone patiently waiting for the living legend to come on next.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can't.  Maybe we better step aside.  Taking up time in that show, you know.  Yeah.  Don't do that.  Someone has something on line three here.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, Opi and Anthony.  This is Cheryl.  Hi, Cheryl.  Hi.  I'm calling regarding your show yesterday when you had Laura Korn on.  Wow. 
[70:00]
 I was dying to know what that tip was when that couple was, she was giving her husband  a hummer.  Right.  And what that move was.  You know, stand back.  I don't know how big it's going to get.  What was the move?  What was the move?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This was supposed to be a technique that made the guy bigger than usual and his orgasm was  tremendous.  Exactly.  Remember he had no energy left?  Yeah.  She shoved an air hose in his ass and pumped him up to 68 pounds per square inch.  No, no, really. 
[70:30]
 See, I have a date coming up.  You sound like you're thinking about giving him a hummer and I wanted to use this technique.  Wait, a date?  Well, yeah, for the weekend.  How many dates have you been on with this man?  About eight.  Oh, it's time for the hummer.  She eats at eight.  So I wanted to make it really excellent.  She eats at eight.  She eats at eight.  Wow, okay.  Are you like hot and stuff?  Yes, definitely.  Are you hot and good looking, slim?  How far have you gone with this guy in eight dates?  Right.  How far have you gone?  Oh, how far?  Yeah.  You know, second base was a little grinding.  What second base again? 
[71:00]
 I forget.  Second base is like touching down the...you've been on the hummer for a while.  Yeah.  Not yet.  Has he touched your patch?  No.  What?  Oh, he's gone up your shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, that's second base.  Okay.  Yeah.  You got ample dairy, as they say?  Excuse me?  Ample dairy.  You've got a good size.  You're sporting.  It's seven o'clock.  It's time to get rude here.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I'm not going to be rude.  I'm just going to make the best of the best.  Okay.  You're going to make the best of the best.  That's the way to do it.  Yeah.  That's the way to do it. 
[71:30]
 It's time to get rude here.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  No, I'm just curious to see how far girls go.  I've been married for a few years, so I'm not sure what the dating scene is like.  Right.  Well, I'm fairly conservative, but you know, when I'm ready, I'd like to give it my all.  Fairly conservative.  Eight dates?  Eight dates.  Over how long of a time period?  About five weeks.  Five weeks.  Five weeks.  The only guy you've been seeing in these five weeks?  What?  Is this the only guy you've been seeing in five weeks?  Yes.  Oh, she's ready to go.  Yeah, okay.  She's ready.  This lucky bastard, does he have any clue that this might be coming tonight? 
[72:00]
 I don't think he has any idea.  Is it going to happen tonight or?  No, Friday.  Oh, Friday.  And now, will you make the move on him or will you wait to see if he tries to make a  move on you?  No, I'm going to make the move.  Oh, this guy is the luckiest man alive.  So, he'll just be sitting there thinking it's going to be another nice date where he might  get to cop a feel.  Exactly.  And all of a sudden, like, what do you do?  Do you reach over and put your hand there?  Yeah, what's the move? 
[72:30]
 Yeah, you know, I threw out the kissing and then I reached down and then I'll just start  undoing his pants and...  Oh, no!  Danger!  Wow, I just got like that tingle in my stomach when she's saying that.  Like you can imagine, you're just sitting there, I'm making out, you've done this before,  hand of shit feeling all worked up and all of a sudden it's like, hey, wait, her hand,  hey, she didn't do this before.  And then the guy's probably thinking he's just maybe getting a little manual manipulation.  Exactly.  And then you start out that way and then what? 
[73:00]
 You're just like looking in the eye, smiling and go south?  Yeah, go south, you know, work my way down slowly, a little tongue action by the belly  and work my way down.  This is the luckiest man on the face of the earth.  She's done this before.  Yeah.  You're a cheery.  So, I wanted to make it extra special and I wanted to know the technique.  Well, we gave away the technique in the private class.  Extra special!  It's like, how do you make that better?  I don't care what Laura Corn says, a bad one's a good one.  Yeah.  You know? 
[73:30]
 Well, we'll let you in on the secret.  Maybe you could use this down the road.  I don't think it's good for a first one because it's a little involved.  You've got to be boiling water and stuff.  You make some tea or a hot beverage and you have a cold beverage next to that, like a glass  of ice water.  Don't forget about the tie, Anthony.  You use a tie to blindfold the guy so he's naked in a chair blindfolded so he doesn't  know what's coming.  And then you drink the hot liquid and you uh, oh, oh, oh.  And then right when he's going crazy, you take a mouthful of the cold liquid and then 
[74:00]
 you uh, oh, oh, oh.  And the temperature change like drives him crazy.  And then you go on and off like that until uh, Eureka!  She's a gusher!  That's the technique.  That's it.  She's speechless.  Actually, I'm on my cell phone.  I think you guys are breaking up a little.  Oh my God!  We just gave away the secret.  What did you hear?  I heard the hot and cold.  Yeah, you go back and forth like that with a guy blindfolded so he doesn't know what's 
[74:30]
 coming.  That's excellent.  All right.  But believe me.  I don't know if I'll do the blindfold right away because I think I'll, you know, it'll  be a little overwhelming at first, but I'll try the hot and cold definitely.  No, he won't want to be blindfolded.  Not the first time.  You want to see that.  You want to look down and go, I can't believe this is happening.  Excellent.  I just want you guys to know that you guys are incredible and I listen to you every day  in my drive home.  Oh, thank you.  You're incredible.  Oh, thanks.  But see, we've got to get off the radio now because the living legend is next. 
[75:00]
 Yeah.  Well, I'm glad that you have this spot now that you're getting off the air.  All right.  Well, we'll try that and please call us back and let us know.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll call you next week.  You know how it went.  Hey, great.  Hey, Hall's worked pretty good too.  Yeah, I heard that and also Altoids.  All the Altoids work?  Yeah, they're all working.  Isn't that what Monica Lewinsky did?  Yeah, that's right.  She did do that.  We could talk to you for hours.  Yeah, I could.  This is just great.  Will he be a part of the Hummer Club even if it's not on a Tuesday?  He is part of the luckiest man on the face of the earth club.  He doesn't even know that whole thing.  Excellent.  I have no clue what's coming at me. 
[75:30]
 Yeah, no, honestly, it has to happen on a Tuesday for him to join the club.  All right.  But I don't think he'll be disappointed if he's not a part of the Hummer Club.  I don't think he'll be disappointed if he's not a part of the Hummer Club.  I don't think he'll be disappointed if he's not a part of the Hummer Club.  One more question.  I'll have to let you know what happened.  One more question, please.  Yeah.  Do you complete the act, let's say?  Definitely.  That's the best part, is the end.  All right.  All right.  I'm done.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Take it easy.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done. 
[76:00]
 I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you.  That's great.  She's out of there.  She is great.  All right, Ann.  Yeah.  Time to move aside, Opie.  You sure?  Yeah.  Wait.  Let me get my vacuum out.  Dust rags.  I got to clean up.  Yeah.  Annty, why don't you take some time to clean up the Living Legend's area so she's got a  nice work area.  Just vacuuming, making sure everything is just so.  If you weren't listening earlier in the show, the Living Legend yelled at Anthony because 
[76:30]
 he left a mess and she said she couldn't work in the atmosphere with everything thrown around  the studio.  Anthony.  Yeah, that's cleaning up real nice. 
[77:00]
 Everything will be fine in no time.  Don't worry.  It will be clean in here.  You need to vacuum a little more right over there.  Oh, yeah.  I missed this.  Oh, my God.  That's where she puts her pile of prep stuff.  That looks better.  I think it's clean enough for Carol to do her show.  Yeah, the Living Legend.  Up next.  I think she's practicing in the other studio.  Would you like to hear?  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, you got that?  You can pull that up? 
[77:30]
 I think so.  Yeah.  Okay, let's hear.  Let's see.  All right, she's getting ready.
