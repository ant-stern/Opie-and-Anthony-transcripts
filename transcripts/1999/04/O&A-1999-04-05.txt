 The Rock of New York 1027 W-A-D-W, The Rolling Stones, Sympathy for the Devil, Kenny Wayne  Shepard before that and Blue on Black and Jane's Addiction with a song I just love hearing  on the radio.  Ben Kotstieler.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  Hey there.  Have a good little weekend?  A very mellow weekend.  Little Easter thing.  Our family doesn't really do the Easter thing.  Oh really?  Well, I don't know.  Well kind of religious but we just kind of blow that holiday off which is kind of strange. 
[00:30]
 Interesting.  Took the folks out to eat.  Yeah.  What else could you do with folks, you know?  Eat.  Eat.  That's what your relationship boils down to after a while.  After a while it's eating.  You have one thing in common, eating.  Eating, yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of sad.  Nah, you know, it's fun to see them.  What do you do, anything?  Well you know, Italian, huh?  And Easter, forget about it. 
[01:00]
 The whole family had a great little Easter get together over at the parents' house there.  Grandma over and everything.  At the complex?  At the compound.  At the compound I mean.  Yeah.  All the relatives, you know, come over and we had Easter dinner and then watched this  final episode of The Sopranos.  Boy, when you're watching it with your family like that.  It can relate, huh? 
[01:30]
 Yeah, just something about that show.  Yeah.  Alright, did you break out the mattresses and stuff?  Yeah, we went to the mattresses.  Went to the mattresses.  Alright, good little weekend.  Very good.  Took a little of Rick's inspiration for a Yoshi song.  Me and Joe got together and threw that one down.  The Yoshi song is going to be debuted in less than an hour here.  Also I brought in some stuff today.  What do you got?  I brought in the tape we were listening to on the way in. 
[02:00]
 Oh yeah, I got to hear this again.  Now the story goes, I got to find it so we can't play it here but this will be a little  tease.  You know Moe on The Simpsons where he gets the prank calls from Bart?  I guess there was a tape that was floating around that was based on the inspiration for  that and I found the tape in my archives.  It's pretty funny.  It's a real old sounding alcoholic guy that is the bartender at this bar and they're just  pranking him with the goofy names a la The Simpsons. 
[02:30]
 Yeah, they give him the names and he yells them out.  Like Anthony said, that's where the inspiration came.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, really funny.  So we'll get that on the radio in a little while.  So as I was digging through our archives I found that Mary Poppins song.  Oh really?  I remember that one.  See we missed a boat on something.  Remember they were talking about pot and legalizing it for some people that just need it to make  the pain go away?  Yeah, the pain of chemo or glaucoma they say.  So yeah, using pot for medical reasons. 
[03:00]
 It was all over the media what, two weeks ago or so?  We have a great song about that that we totally forgot about.  The Mary Poppins song.  So I'm going to get that ready and we'll play something really cool next.  Alright, so we got the Yoshi, we got the prank call thing, we got the Mary Poppins.  Your phone calls?  Your phone calls, your faxes, 212-957-WNEW and lots of stupid.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW Creed from the debut CD My Own Prison, that's one. 
[03:30]
 And a lot of a-holes checking in today.  What do you got?  A lot of people in bad moods.  Jim from Jersey, would you please stop playing this stupid Creed song every damn day?  Monday people getting off on the wrong foot here.  You think?  Well then we got Emily from New York City, she loves the pictures of Suzanne and Tara.  Those two battling it out this coming Friday for the hottest girl to pose naked on the  Open Anthony show and she said she'd do either one of them. 
[04:00]
 That's kind of nice Emily, thank you for that.  That's what Randy in Jersey.  And then we got Randy from Jersey.  Hey, did you guys know you're very butt ugly?  Randy, why are you noticing if we're hot or not?  Would you even write to a guy to tell him if he's attractive or not?  What?  How?  I find that a little weird.  I've never in my life said a guy was hot.  Randy, I find you very attractive. 
[04:30]
 Sorry you feel that way.  I thought maybe we'd date.  What's out there Randy?  It's a little weird.  You're taking too close of a look.  Whatever.  Everyone looks a little more attractive through the glory hole.  Remember that.  Oh brother, let's see what the people have today.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi guys.  I was called to tell you that last week I was in Hollywood and I was having lunch at  this restaurant and Andrew Dice Clay came in through the back door and sat next to me 
[05:00]
 He's in his gold gym sweatshirt and sweatpants and he starts smoking a cigarette and everything  and it's like a real elegant restaurant.  Everyone is dressed up.  And he was dressed like a slob?  Yeah he looked f***ing cool.  Is Dice in here?  We got a man maybe.  Uh, Rick, open the door.  Dice just happens to be hanging out on the couch.  He wants a mic time.  What is this, a jackass huh?  Hey Dice, you were in LA?  Hey asshole!  Hey asshole!  Yes?  What did you say?  You saw me?  I saw you. 
[05:30]
 In California huh?  I saw you and your wife and your kid.  Yeah well I wasn't even in California.  Jerk off.  You're a jerk off.  You think I go into nice restaurants dressed like a slob like you?  You jerk off.  Huh?  What's the matter?  You can't talk?  I saw you dude.  You asshole huh?  I saw you there.  You're an ass.  What, what did he order?  Yeah what did the Dice have?  I didn't want to bother him.  I really, we had to leave before he got his food and everything.  I just saw him eating the bread.  Hey look you don't have better things than that.  I just saw him eating the bread.  Hey look you don't have better things than that.  I just saw him eating the bread. 
[06:00]
 I just saw him eating the bread.  You don't have better things to do than look and see what the Dice is doing huh?  Did you buy my new album?  Hell no.  Yeah he's an asshole.  I could tell this guy's a jerk off.  He's looking at me.  Yeah what did you want my toob steak?  He wanted to steal my toob steak while we're having dinner.  I saw you.  You're a jerk off.  I was also.  A snap ahead.  You know who else came in?  Oh.  Sandra Bernhard.  Ugh.  Her and her Lesbo lover and their kid.  She's a dyke.  Yeah. 
[06:30]
 Oh that's right she's got a kid now.  That's cute.  Yeah look mister I'm in Hollywood looking at the stars.  Looking at what the stars eat.  What you get yourself a broad huh?  What are you a fag or something?  You gotta look at what the Dice man's doing.  Envy the Dice man that I could wear crappy clothes in a nice place huh?  What were you in a smuxedo?  Jerk off.  Hang up on this asshole.  I don't need this crap from these people.  They watch me like a hawk. 
[07:00]
 They gotta watch me.  Your album's doing great in New York.  My album's kicking ass.  Yeah I see that.  Filt.  Dice.  Filt.  It's back to being the old Dice.  Not the sweet cuddly coochie coo postman Dice.  Now I curse.  I use the C word.  I use snap ahead.  I use the good begin.  Well Dice Anthony saw you a couple weeks ago.  Yeah huh?  What'd you think?  Well he said.  I actually it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Aw Anthony. 
[07:30]
 Not as bad.  Look see.  Not as bad as he thought it was going to be.  Well he didn't say that it's great Dice.  Actually uh, it sucked.  What do you mean sucked?  I got your money asshole.  I got your money.  Well Dice I think he said that everyone was laughing at you not with you.  How could he tell?  Huh?  He was in the front row.  They can't tell if they're laughing.  They were laughing at the Dice man's jokes.  Damn funny.  It's back to the Dice of the 80s.  Remember the Dice man. 
[08:00]
 1985.  Hickory Dickory Doug.  This chick was hecky.  Yeah great stuff.  Don't you have any updated poems?  Well you want new poems?  Yeah give us a new one.  Something new.  Something topical.  Alright.  Your old mother Hubbard lived in a cupboard.  But it's better than Kosovo.  Hicky!  Yeah that's great stuff.  Better than your crap.  I listened to your show.  It sucks alright. 
[08:30]
 Alright Dice could you leave?  Yeah I'll be happy to get out of here.  Alright later Dice.  Yeah that's it.  There he goes the Dice man.  What a thrill having him on.  Hey is it true Larry Flint's calling us today?  Is that what I'm hearing?  The Larry Flint?  The Larry Flint.  From Hustler magazine?  Yeah.  He's got like a hero.  Yeah he's a god.  Do I have to be one of the senators?  I like vaginas and boobies. 
[09:00]
 That's right.  Mr. Flint.  Hello.  Hey there he is.  That's Larry Flint.  How are you?  Fine how are you doing?  Good. 
[09:30]
 It's Ophi and Anthony.  Thanks for checking in today.  Glad to be with you.  Alright now you got the Flint report coming out tomorrow.  Yellow.  Yeah.  You got the Flint report coming out tomorrow Larry right?  That's right.  Okay.  We just got our copies minutes ago.  Didn't have time to browse through it unfortunately.  So what can you tell us about this?  Well it's a historical document.  No one has published anything like it for that period of time. 
[10:00]
 We wanted the American people to be able to see a cross section of their legislative  law for how they really are and emphasize that they're not to put them on a pedestal  or idolize them because they suffer from the same weakness, disaffirmative that we all  do.  Now why are you focusing only on the Republicans?  You know I've been asked that question numerous times and I swear to you that everything that 
[10:30]
 came in was unrepublished.  You know there's a bit of wisdom in Washington D.C. when it comes to scandal.  That the Democrats and Republicans have money but in actuality it's a complete opposite.  Interesting.  Now I think that's because the right wing Republicans are more repressed. 
[11:00]
 You know they're not in the liberal mode.  So they have to go behind closed doors and get a hand job from hookers and stuff.  They're always in the closet and they always get caught.  Now can you give us a little bit of what's going to be in this tomorrow?  Well we've got the complete report on of course Livingston and Barr and we've got Kenwood. 
[11:30]
 Now what kind of dirt do you have on Mary Bono?  Well it's obvious that Mary was having an affair while Sonny was in Congress.  And I just thought the way she took a holier than now position with the impeachment committee  and voted for impeaching the president that really spacked the park in a big way. 
[12:00]
 Any chance of getting her naked in a future Hustler magazine?  No I doubt that.  You know she didn't deny the affair but we've got three different sources on that.  Look at the Larry's turned into man. 
[12:30]
 I like the Larry Flint that just put the naked chicks in the magazine.  I mean now you're like this investigative reporter.  Well it's still my vocation but power can't get my heart.  I remember being a kid it was just you know if you got a Playboy or a Penthouse that was one thing.  But if you could score a hustler that was like goal.  That was like doing smack.  I loved it. 
[13:00]
 Yeah it's rewarding now when people come out to me on the street.  I just want to shake your hand and thank you for helping me make it through puberty.  Suddenly I realized we've been around for 25 years so we probably helped a lot of young boys.  Hey Larry don't you think it's ironic though that you pump out a hustler magazine but you can't even spank one out yourself?  That's got to be terrible man. 
[13:30]
 You know?  I mean you get to look at all these hotties and you know.  How does someone like Larry Flint get off?  No you know I'm not just as action-packed as I ever was.  Really? Can you sport wood or do you need one of the pumps or something?  No my entry was not to my spinal cord.  It was to the funnel on the nerve at the base of my spinal cord. 
[14:00]
 Oh so you still get action?  Yeah.  Oh cool.  Well that's good.  My possessions are limited.  They never caught who shot you?  Yeah he's on death row for some more unrelated shooting.  You're sure it's him?  Yeah I'm probably sure. 
[14:30]
 Alright now with this Flint report coming out tomorrow you also have something on Governor Bush.  A lot of people thinking he's going to be the next candidate for president.  Can you tell us anything about that?  Well you know I have no doubt about it you know.  He's a pretty wild guy and he's underage but I don't think that should disqualify him for running for president. 
[15:00]
 I don't think anyone said so as to the president to disqualify him.  I still think that in the year 2000 there's still going to be a question that's going to be asked about all the candidates.  Of course.  Hey what does Larry Flint run? That would be something.  Then at least if there's some gas in the Oval Office everyone will understand why. It's Larry Flint. 
[15:30]
 Hey you think Monica's hot or you think she's a pig? Like when you put her in your magazine naked?  I hurt Linda Tripp for my best excuses for not watching television.  I think a hustler spread Linda Tripp and Monica and their fists. You know what I mean?  Now that would sell some copies.  Working each other like hand puppets right Larry?  Yeah. 
[16:00]
 Alright well the Flint Report comes out tomorrow. It's going to be all over the news obviously.  And people can pick this up on the newsstands as well?  Yeah.  Okay. And we'll find out more about Newt Gingrich and Governor Bush and Mary Bono's in there.  I wanted to see a scratch and sniff centerfold though in this but I open it up and see Newt Gingrich.  Why didn't you put any nude chicks in this?  Well we wanted to make sure that we got the widest distribution possible. 
[16:30]
 Oh I see. I do see some nip.  Page 17 you did sneak some boobage in though. I like that.  Let me see.  Oh yeah there you go. Okay.  Alright Larry well thanks for spending a few minutes with us today.  Okay guys.  Hey did you ever see Courtney Love naked when you guys were filming that movie?  Oh.  Is that a yes?  Yeah I've seen Courtney push a couple times.  Yeah. Love that. What would you rate it on a scale of one to ten? 
[17:00]
 Well Courtney had a wild look on her face.  Yeah wild.  I bet she showed you some stuff.  She had nice cans in that movie too.  Did she show you her balloon knot?  Balloon knot? That's one of the great things about Hustler. You see balloon knots in Hustler. 
[17:30]
 They're bent over everything.  Alright Larry doesn't want to play.  Alright Larry.  Well Mr. Flint thanks for checking in today.  Okay guys.  We'll all go out and get the Flint Report tomorrow okay?  Alright.  Alright it's Larry Flint everyone.  Wow.  Wow.  You know he kind of... what do they do when they're interviewing him on TV where he's talking and stuff?  What is that an animatronic Larry that they got on TV?  I thought he was in... I thought he was in Kosovo with the delay. 
[18:00]
 Larry how's the bombing there?  Ah it's very good.  Look at me talking. If I took a bullet I'd be dead.  Yeah without a doubt.  Alright well I don't know what we learned there but...  No we learned that he saw Courtney Love naked and she's got a nice bush.  And she's wild.  That's worth the price of admission right there.  Now he's sorting through any political bull crap.  Alright.  Larry Flint.  I guess that's another Opien Anthony exclusive. 
[18:30]
 Of course. That'll be on USA Today. I'm sure there's some quotes from that interview.  Anthony we're starting to get a lot of sponsors on our radio show.  Yes.  I especially like the sponsors that are trying to save our listeners money.  And have free services to do so.  Without a doubt and Autofinance of America is another one of these services trying to save you some money.  How much are you paying on your car payment every month?  Two, three, four hundred a month.  I pay too much.  Yeah a lot of people are.  And did you realize that you could refinance your car payment? 
[19:00]
 Interest rates are lower now. So if you refinance your car loan your monthly payments will be less.  They're talking they could save you possibly thirty, forty, maybe even fifty dollars every single month.  And over the term of a loan that could add up to like a thousand saves.  Think of how many of Larry Flint's hustler magazines you could buy with the savings.  My God.  Incredible amount.  All it takes is a phone call to see what they could do for you. It's free. Free number. Call 1-800-993-1000. 
[19:30]
 Anthony before we go back into the music, Larry Flint called back and he wants to say a few more words here.  Mr. Flint.  Yeah.  I almost forgot.  You almost forgot what Mr. Flint?  My people also buy my hustler magazines.  Okay.  They're features of girls.  Girls look like they've got Fidel Castro eating a London broil in their lap. 
[20:00]
 That's what hustlers are all about.  Yeah, a little less classy than Playboy and Penthouse.  We just go right for the meat and potatoes.  Hey Mr. Flint. Hello?  Oh, you're still there? Okay.  I was napping.  Now I've got to ask you something. You're probably a billionaire, right?  Huh? Yeah, I'm a billionaire. 
[20:30]
 So why didn't you use some of that money to get some acting lessons before you filmed that movie?  You know, you were the judge in that movie?  I thought I did quite well for a smut peddler.  Playing the judge.  It's hard to talk. I've got a vagina over my head.  Yeah, to be honest with you, it took us right out of the movie when you came on the screen.  Your acting was...  Sorry, it's muffled. There's three naked girls sitting on my head. 
[21:00]
 It's hard for me to talk.  Alright, Mr. Flint. Well, thanks for calling back, okay?  Huh?  Is it time for your nap?  Huh? What?  Are you going to go to Happy Hour with Stephen Hawkins?  Yeah, I'm going to have wheelchair races.  Okay. Alright, well, we'll talk to you soon. 
[21:30]
 Okay.  Alright. Where did Anthony go? Larry Flint calls back in and Anthony is nowhere to be seen.  Ant? Ant?  Ant? You just missed Larry Flint.  We've talked to him already.  He called back in. He just wanted to add some stuff to the conversation.  I had so many unanswered questions.  Okay. 
[22:00]
 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York with Everlast, What It's Like.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony?  Hey, man.  What's up, buddy?  Whoa! What the heck?  Yo-Yoshi?  Error! Error!  What the hell?  He just pedaled from Yoshi's and Keaton.  I have an order.  Wait, wait, wait.  You ordered food. You ordered everything.  Well, we did order. 
[22:30]
 You ordered tongue, tongue, tongue, pork.  Yeah, that's mine.  Anthony, you have the tongue, tongue, tongue, pork.  Rick, you have a tongue, tongue, tongue, pork with a brown sauce.  And then I went wha?  Who got the one, two, three, tongue, wha?  That would be Mark.  Mark, you got the tongue, tongue, tongue, wha?  And the tongue, wha?  Pork! 
[23:00]
 Right here.  Yoshi, I bring everything.  Risk life and limb.  Pedder down street.  Almost get hit by a taxi cab.  Yo-Yoshi, many times.  You sound like one of those model airplanes when you talk.  What do you mean?  Don't understand.  Something missing from bag.  Can't find shitaki mushrooms.  What?  Cannot find shitaki mushrooms.  Oh, you scared me. 
[23:30]
 Oh, here they are.  That's for the boss.  I just say shitaki mushrooms.  Okay, all right.  Don't understand why you get so upset when I go, hey, shitaki mushrooms.  Hey!  Now, Yoshi, we order food from your restaurant, what, twice a week?  Yes, very good.  Twice a week.  Twice a week.  Usually.  I leave a menu for you.  Yeah, I know, under everyone's doors.  Yes.  We all have 100 menus.  We don't need any more menus from Yoshi's restaurant.  Never know.  You might need more.  I don't think so.  Now, listen.  And I change menu.  You did? 
[24:00]
 Yes, that's why I leave new one.  Oh.  If you notice, the restaurant, see it says, chung-fung-fung, pock, here, had to change  to fun-kung-fung-fung-pock.  That's totally different.  What's the difference?  A very different flavor.  Oh, okay.  You had chung-fung-fung-pock made with chung-fung-fung, pock, pock, chung-fung-fung-pock made with  chung-fung-fung, chung-fung-pock made with chung-fung-fung, pock, chung-fung-fung-pock.  You sound like you're stupid.  You don't know.  You're sounding like that model airplane again.  I didn't know what to talk about. 
[24:30]
 Now listen.  Hey!  We order from you twice a week.  Usually you just leave it in the lobby and Rick gets it and he passes it out to the whole  staff.  Why did you insist on coming onto our show and jumping in here?  Well, I know this radio station.  Right.  Radio station.  Correct.  Maybe you help Yoshi get out of our kitchen.  What do you mean?  Into a rock and roll scene.  How are we going to do that?  Yoshi have a song.  Yoshi?  Yoshi has a song. 
[25:00]
 Yoshi has a song.  I have a small part in this song.  Okay.  But it's about me.  There's a song about you now, Yoshi.  About me and my bicycle.  Do you see me on the street every day?  Ride my bike, big chain.  Hey!  We feel honored.  We're going to debut it here on our show?  Debut here.  Okay.  Hey!  This is it right here?  Yes.  About me and my old bicycle.  What's the name of this thing?  I don't know.  You don't know?  It's a...  It's a...

[27:30]
 I see that.  Yes.  It was recorded out on street that fast.  Very big pile up on 57th street.  I smell an MTV video with that.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Oh the dream I have of being on MTV.  Yes.  Get away from my wok.  Your what?  My wok.  Oh your wok.  That's what I cook in.  Yeah I see.  What's the matter with you?  Thank you for debuting on my song.  I think we're going to be playing that a lot here. 
[28:00]
 Now I have to go to Z100.  And prod my song.  And then K-Lock.  Alright Yoshi.  Maybe I could be next to Jesse on MTV.  Oh jeez.  Jesse-san.  Let me try.  Okay.  Er, rough this band man.  Very cool.  I sound stupid enough.  Yeah you do.  Yeah.  Hey.  Alright.  Well I guess you've got to leave.  You have other stations to go to to pass out your song. 
[28:30]
 Thank you very much for having Yoshi.  Yoshi.  Hey.  Becoming famous before our eyes everyone.  Boy that was good huh?  That was great.  Look at him running down the hall.  There he goes.  With his Pete Rose haircut.  Well that's the only one he ever had.  I know.  His whole family has it.  Only so many styles you can choose from.  Well got to thank Anthony's brother Joe for helping out here.  And Yoshi there.  Yoshi said he didn't know how to play the instrument.  He backed them up yeah. 
[29:00]
 Very good.  Alright.  More stupidity on the way.  Oh we're going to be playing that Buck Cherry song.  I like it.  Cool.  The cocaine song.  Cool.  But you wouldn't know that if you listen to MTV because they bleep out cocaine.  Yeah the biggest part of the song.  The biggest part of the song.  Yeah the chorus.  They bleep it out.  What?  That has to go on the air.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW the Scorpions and the new band before that Buck Cherry with 
[29:30]
 Lit Up.  I love that freaking song.  Especially the unedited version.  You see the video on MTV and they're doing something weird with the word cocaine which  is the whole hook of the song.  I guess MTV is too good to have cocaine on their airwaves or something.  I don't know.  I don't care.  Holier than now.  But screw all that.  It's Opiate Anthony and Rick who produces the show.  And just before this we went on mic.  Anthony was explaining now what Rick called you at home over the weekend.  Rick called.  Yeah called the house. 
[30:00]
 Jennifer answered the phone.  Right.  And Rick get a mic.  I was just getting up to get in the shower.  So I have nothing on.  I'm walking into the bathroom and Jen goes Rick's on the phone.  I go okay I come back in but now I got to find my sweats and put them on.  Jen's laughing at me going what are you doing?  You're getting in the shower.  I go no I got to put pants on before I talk to Rick because I don't want to be a phone  home all.  Come on.  That's almost like having gay sex. 
[30:30]
 You can't talk to your pal while you're naked.  That's bizarre but there are just.  Bizarre why?  If I call you there are sometimes where you're naked.  Jesus don't even tell me.  Wait wait wait wait.  Honestly I can't remember a time because it's not that big of a deal but there are  times like you're coming out of the shower or whatever and you put on a towel before  you talk to me on the phone.  You have to be naked and you have to answer the phone.  Phone homo.  That's weird. 
[31:00]
 Phone homo.  You don't talk to guys naked.  What's the difference between talking to them naked on the phone and being in front of them.  We don't have the Jetsons video phone yet.  You're sitting there talking on the phone and you look down and there's your Schween  and your friend's voice is going in your ear.  It's just too phone homo.  I don't know man.  I don't think that hard on that one.  You should.  You better.  You better start pal.  See the thing is I use the phone a lot when I'm on the can. 
[31:30]
 So what does that do to me?  Ah that's just disgusting.  That's like a phone Cleveland steamer.  I had to be listening to a Friday show to get the reference.  No you can't.  You can't talk to people on the phone.  I've been in a situation with Rick where he calls me and I'm like what are you doing?  You can just tell he's taking a dump.  Now that's different because you can tell.  But if you're naked and I don't know.  Ah.  Wait and you're not leading on to that then who cares.  I don't know.  Because.  But in Rick's case when he's taking a dump and you just know he's taking a dump then 
[32:00]
 you get the visual and then you're really grossed out.  You want to stand there naked talking to your friend.  I don't want to.  With your pals voice going in your ear.  I make sure I don't look down or anything.  Why bother with that?  Put some pants on.  Come to the phone.  Because it's too much of a hassle.  Yeah that's too much of a problem.  I think the problem is standing there with your things waving in the breeze. 
[32:30]
 Yeah what's up man?  I don't know you talk about my foibles.  I'm not talking about your foibles and I don't want them swinging in the breeze while you're  talking to me on the phone.  Foibles quarks whatever.  You talk about my quarks.  That's a weird quark.  Phone homo.  That's weird.  For guys on the phone.  Now if it's a hot girl I'll be on the phone naked.  I don't know.  Would you stand there naked talking to your mom on the phone.  I did that this weekend.  Jesus you are a sick man.  You're a sick man.  She called for Easter and I was naked. 
[33:00]
 Ah God your mother.  Well what am I going to do.  You put pants on.  You don't talk to your mother on the phone naked.  Jiminy Cricket is that disgusting.  She's also interrupted sex.  No.  At that point you're naked.  Yeah but you can cover yourself with a sheet.  Ah come on.  Boy I almost cursed.  Sometimes I forget we're on the radio.  I almost said you're f'ed up.  It's different because you're not looking.  You're not vulnerable standing out there naked. 
[33:30]
 You're covered.  But then you've got some.  You're pitching a tent on the bed.  Can you talk to your mom with a rod.  Come on.  Ah God is that bad.  Evidently that's not a problem for you.  As long as you're covered you can be you know having a circus going on underneath the sheet.  You can't be in states of excitement either.  Of course not.  You're standing there naked with your mom on the phone.  Yeah because then honestly at that point I thought to myself that it was a little weird. 
[34:00]
 You're right.  You know what it is.  I'm not retarded.  I understand that they can't see you and there's no real physical contact.  It's the whole idea of the audio and visual thing of it.  You are seeing yourself naked and you are hearing the voice of your mom in your head.  Do you need that?  What if you're looking out a window?  If you're looking out a window what the hell does that have to do with anything? 
[34:30]
 No honestly I felt a little weird because I was naked.  But I also knew that it was too much of a hassle to run upstairs and get pants and all that crap.  You're looking down at your stuff and your mom is talking to you about Easter.  You're looking at your own eggs.  That's disgusting.  You've got to throw some pants on when you talk to mom on the phone.  Mom look what the Easter bunny sent you.  Mom I got your present here.  I'm going to bring a special Easter basket for you that I have to hold in my lap when you open it. 
[35:00]
 It's moving.  Look it's a peep.  I don't know man.  Speaking of peeps, did you OD on peeps?  Oh man I had a sugar rush.  You OD on those.  I had the worst headache yesterday because I just really don't eat a lot of sugar or try not to.  Sandy made me a little basket with those stupid pink peeps.  Remember I said I like pink and you said you like the yellow.  I like the yellow, the standard peach. 
[35:30]
 She left me like three of those little boxes that have six each.  They're all stuck together.  You've got to kind of pull them apart.  No eight each.  I had 24 of them.  Man that is like sugar rush.  Three hours later I had the worst headache imaginable.  My God your pancreas goes into overdrive.  You can't eat that many peeps.  Hi NAW.  Yeah I want a clarification.  Yeah.  Alright you get in service and your buddy calls.  What are you?  You still don't know or you're a mailman?  Well that happened. 
[36:00]
 No actually Anthony heard my voice on his answering machine while he was dogging his wife one  after another.  I would like the term maybe making love, having sex.  He was bumping uglies.  Dogging my wife.  I don't think I dog my wife.  I don't know what you do with your girlfriend but the thing I do with my wife I don't call  dogging.  Come on there are times you admitted you've had retarded sex.  What's the difference?  Dogging, retarded sex?  Retarded sex is different than dogging.  Well sometimes you dog a whore you pick up. 
[36:30]
 Well sometimes.  You don't dog your wife.  Sometimes you want a little role playing in your relationship.  You're a dirty girl.  I'm going to dog you.  Dog you.  I was having sex with my wife and Opie leaves a message on the machine.  It's great.  It's like oh yeah honey, oh yeah you're getting into it.  Wait wait wait wait.  I was thinking today for the show maybe as a story on the post. 
[37:00]
 I'm just like oh this is great Opie is on the phone.  It's like gone, gone.  Well turn down your answering machine.  What about if you kick him back and you know you're relaxing and your girlfriend is giving  you a hummer and you know your phone rings and you just take out the phone.  Well if you're willing to bring your friend in on a little phone threesome like that it's  your business.  Wait you don't have to tell them.  It's your business.  You get off on that.  No.  Oh okay. 
[37:30]
 I like when my mom is on the phone and I'm dogging my wife as Opie said.  Alright man we've got to fly.  Alright thanks a lot.  Bye.  If you care it's definitely you should be clothed talking to certain people on the phone  for your own sanity Opie.  Hey what's your deal man?  Well I heard that you love talking to naked men or talking to people all naked so I'm  naked so you can talk to them.  Come on out with it.  No I don't care.  Go ahead chat it up Opie.  I don't know the guy is stalk naked. 
[38:00]
 You have a field day.  Are you sporting wood now Opie?  I'm kidding it's Paul.  Very good well add that to the list of quirks for Anthony alright.  Hey for Opie not Anthony.  It's an Opie quirk.  Yeah look at Opie's thinking add that to Anthony's quirk list.  He agrees with me Opie.  I think if we took a poll more people would say that it's really no big deal.  Yeah your poll is the problem.  It shouldn't be exposed while you're on the phone.  This is just another call for help Opie. 
[38:30]
 Is it?  Thank you Paul.  I see this.  Paul you've never just talked to someone real fast while being naked?  No you know I actually did get caught on the phone one time.  I'm stepping on the shower the phone rings I pick it up and I actually had to set the  phone down to put a robot.  There you go.  So it didn't feel comfortable.  You're a gentleman.  What if there's no clothes around?  What are you a can of cave?  Kill a mammoth and wrap the fur around you.  There's a phone there's clothing.  And that was just a friend.  If that was my mother I would have said automatically I would have hung up I've got to call you 
[39:00]
 back.  Right exactly.  You're not going to stand what you scratching your ass and picking and what are you doing  while you're on the phone naked with your mom.  I admitted it was a little bizarre but I just went through.  Wait a minute you got some kind of perverted pleasure from this is that what I'm hearing?  No no no.  You're an ass.  We all heard it Opie.  I think it was an addiction.  You were spanking it while you were on the phone with your mom.  Don't pull an Opie on an Opie come on.  That's my deal.  Come on. 
[39:30]
 So you've got Anthony in a closet having sex with a priest.  Yeah exactly.  Anthony's got you swanking it while talking to your mom.  No that wasn't a closet with the priest it was a phone booth.  I was on the phone with my mom.  Jesus.  You're sick.  You're sick.  Thank you Paul.  Bye.  See I think the majority of the people agree that you should put clothing on while speaking  if you're a guy while talking to your friends, male friends.  Girls, I don't care.  I'll be on the phone naked.  Or your mom.  I'll admit it's a little bizarre but if the other person doesn't know who cares. 
[40:00]
 Because you're like I said it's an audio visual experience.  It's an audio visual experience.  You're hearing your friend, a guy, the guy you've known in your ear and you're looking  around and looking down and you're naked.  I didn't say I'd be looking down.  You're looking around.  You're just naked.  You know you're naked.  And your friend's voice in your ear.  Well you know something else is in your ear. 
[40:30]
 Phone homo.  So we have to do 20 minutes on this?  Phone homo.  Eddie W.  Hey Opie.  Yeah.  Listen I don't think it's a big deal if you're naked on the phone.  That's what I said.  Why don't you come over my house.  I think it's cool.  Like if you're talking to your wife's friend or something, another chick.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  That's very cool.  Yeah.  I mean if you don't deal with it, you don't bother with it.  If you're talking to your buddy, you know he calls you and you're getting in the shower.  So you would talk to your guy friend, start naked?  Yeah. 
[41:00]
 You know if you have to, you have to.  There you go.  What if you don't know he's naked too?  Then you're having gay love right there.  If I know he's naked it might be a problem.  If someone admits they're naked, then that's a whole different topic.  Before you know it you're having phone sex and you've got to go to the hospital to get  the receiver removed.  I don't think that's going to happen.  Well thank you.  Alright fellas, bye.  Later.  Alright, I think we've spent enough time on naked phone conversations.  Very probing in depth. 
[41:30]
 I think you're a phone homo.  This is not even me.  It was between you and Rick.  How did I get in this?  I just thought it was weird.  Because you say that you don't care.  And you're a phone pervert because you're on the phone with your mom naked.  Well that just happens.  That's bizarre.  It doesn't just happen.  You find out it's your mom and you're like, oh, wait.  Get some clothes on.  Okay.  You don't answer the phone naked.  You never know who it is.  You're a priest soliciting money.  You're naked.  Mmm, priest.  Alright, we've got to take a break here. 
[42:00]
 We've got so much stuff to do today.  We really do.  We've barely started.  Alright, so before we get back to the music, hey what do you got?  Hey, Open Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey guys, I want to know if it's, the same rule applies if I listen to your show naked,  which is what I always do.  Oh, geez.  What are we doing?  Do you really listen to our show naked?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, you know, I mean, you know, I'm in the house, you know, and doing some cleaning. 
[42:30]
 And, you know, spring is coming up and I'm naked and you're not listening to your show  naked.  I can understand when the ladies are in here, but spring cleaning.  Ugh.  Leaving trails of hair, curly hairs.  Jesus.  I can only imagine what people are doing while they listen to our show.  I wonder how many people like have sex during our show or...  Ugh.  Yeah, that's a thought.  Well, that wouldn't be bad.  I don't know.  When you're on this end of the microphone, it's kind of strange to think what people  are doing while they listen to us. 
[43:00]
 Put pants on, okay?  Put pants on?  Yeah.  We don't want you listening naked.  Okay.  Alright, man.  Take care.  The Rock of New York, 1027W&W. Johnny Lang, still raining.  So, good, Anthony.  We had to cut in here because we were wondering what people did while they listened to our  radio show.  And we got a doctor on the line.  Hm.  Hi, NAW.  What's going on, man?  Hey, who's this?  How are you?  My name's Rob.  Hey, Rob. 
[43:30]
 How you doing?  I don't know many doctors that say, hey, what's going on, man.  You don't?  No, not really.  Well, that's what happens when you're a second year resident.  Oh, okay.  So, what's the deal?  You guys listen to us in the operating room?  Well, I'm one of the residents that they give us, they teach us circumcisions.  I watch ER.  I know what a resident is.  I wish it was that easy, just looking cool.  That would not be so bad.  You're like that hot chick from Life Goes On on ER.  Nah, not really, dude. 
[44:00]
 Well, she's a resident.  Well, yeah, but we actually work.  Or are you more like Noah Wiley?  We actually work.  No, what it is is we actually work.  Yeah, like 18 hours.  So, ER is really not that believable to you guys?  Some of it's kind of believable.  I guess it's kind of cool from a TV aspect, but it's not that easy.  Okay.  Man, you do circumcisions?  That was one of the first things I actually had to do.  Let me tell you a little story. 
[44:30]
 I was working at St. John's Hospital out in Suffolk County doing cheap metal work.  Cheap metal work.  No, doctor, don't get disillusioned like I actually did something.  Bigger than a pair of tin snips.  Yeah, tin snips.  No, I was working next to the nursery.  And through this window, I saw this kid getting a circumcision.  And the poor little thing is in this little plastic tray.  Yeah, we strap him down.  They strap him down.  He's strapped down.  And then they put this little apparatus on his schween. 
[45:00]
 And it's like stretched.  Being from a lovely Jewish heritage that I am from, they call it a Zemo.  The thing is they just dip you in wine first.  Oh, really?  Everybody eats while it's going on.  They snap you.  Boom, you're done.  All I know is I saw this kid strapped down to this little plastic thing that looked like  a slide, like one of those little plastic slides that you take down.  Yeah, it's like got the little kid's body shape in it.  Yeah, they do it from the child flying around. 
[45:30]
 He can't hurt himself.  Yeah.  So he's strapped down.  And then they put this apparatus over his schween and pull his schween through it.  So now it's like all stretched out and the kid's just like freaking out.  Let me tell you something that's even worse.  When you're standing right there, you have to hear him screaming.  You have to be pretty precise at this point in time.  Yeah.  That is horrible.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah, you know, I think maybe it should wait until the kid gets a little older and let 
[46:00]
 him make his own decision at that point.  What the fuck is this laying there?  They don't know what's going on.  The worst part is they don't give him even a topical nothing.  Just snip away.  Oh, man.  All right, so.  And I want to know what the hell is with you talking to your mother naked on the phone.  Yeah, I'll be your sick bastard.  I think that's an issue maybe that you might want to resolve on some sort of counseling.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'll be calling you a sick bastard.  Listen, I wasn't waiting around in my living room, you know, naked, knowing my mom was 
[46:30]
 going to call on Easter Sunday.  The time you're calling, Mom, she should be calling any minute now.  Dude, I don't care.  Your mother calls.  Put on some clothes for Christ's sake.  Exactly.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm ready for it.  That's an issue you might want to work out.  My two eggs and my peep are ready.  She usually calls about now.  They've got it all set up in a little Easter basket.  A little green grass around it.  I cut the bottom of the basket out.  Put little bunny ears on it. 
[47:00]
 You know, if I would have thought about that, I actually would have pulled that off of my girlfriend.  That's a good idea.  That's not bad.  All right, why is the chocolate bunny twitching?  Why is the little bunny drooling?  Come on now.  All right, so listen.  We always got to go too far.  All right, listen.  So in the operating room, you have our show cranked.  Sometimes your show is cranked.  Let's see.  One of the doctors the other day was actually listening to Ride the Lightning. 
[47:30]
 Oh wow.  Which is, I think they were doing a splenectomy.  And he was listening to Ride the Lightning.  Wow.  Whatever relaxes them.  Yeah, that's it.  I don't know if I want them operating on me listening to Ride the Lightning.  I know what it does to me.  Yeah, it gets a two-two stop, right?  Definitely, man.  All right, man.  Well, thanks for checking in.  Definitely, bro.  It was good talking to you.  All right, buddy.  Bye-bye.  Later, man.  Just got a fax here.  We're asking, you know, wondering about what people do when they listen to our show. 
[48:00]
 This just came in from Monique.  Me and my boss Sam were getting off while Earl was being disciplined by Spike.  Wow.  They were doing it.  They were doing it when they were listening to Earl get spanked.  How about that?  Her and her boss?  This is getting a little bizarre.  That's kind of cool, though.  Another one came in.  I get wet listening to your show.  Oh, great. 
[48:30]
 Gotta love that.  More babble.  Psycho-babble?  Yeah.  Got a puzzled look on your face.  Well, because then it was psycho-babble.  But she gets wet.  Sign me.  That's good.  All right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, find that on the tab.  If you're just tuning in, we interviewed Larry Flint earlier.  And he was really Larry Flint the first time.  Yeah, the first time.  Then Anthony got on the phone and did Larry Flint the second time. 
[49:00]
 We have to explain some of this stuff because people get really confused.  But the interview was going okay, but then we asked him if he ever saw Courtney Love Naked.  And his reaction is classic.  He just starts laughing.  All right.  Well, something to look forward to if you're just tuning in to the show.  But who do we have on the line?  Me.  Who's me?  The first and probably only female who listens to your show anymore.  Oh, come on.  We get a lot of girls that listen. 
[49:30]
 Who aren't hopeless dancers.  No, we all listen to you.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, the first time I listened to you, I wanted to leave New York.  There was nothing to listen to on the radio.  That didn't offend me.  But now you like us or no?  You're funny.  Okay, let's listen to her.  What can I do?  Let me explain some because you bring up a good point.  Okay.  We do hear from the ladies all the time that we get preoccupied with the sex stuff.  Okay?  If you notice, we do try to space it out.  I mean, Lord knows if it was up to Anton and I, we'd have sex every day on our radio show. 
[50:00]
 Yes.  But we know there's more to do and more things to answer.  Now, wait a minute.  Anthony doesn't even like to talk to his friends when he's on the phone naked.  So why would he have sex with you in the radio station every day?  Sex with you?  No, not that.  I know what you meant.  Oh my God.  I'm pulling your chain.  Yes, you pull that chain.  Make the water come out.  Anyway, you don't have a computer at home, do you, Mike?  What are you kidding?  I've got the total hookup setup. 
[50:30]
 Oh, really?  Oh, of course.  I'm the gaming maven.  And you're not used to sitting there at the computer, using the phone line.  You're not used to sitting and chatting online.  Wait, wait.  Like naked?  I'm not naked on the computer.  Let me explain something to Anthony.  Anthony got over that whole computer sex thing very early.  He barely uses it for porno anymore.  He's into online gaming.  All right, no, everyone.  Wait, wait.  Anthony has such a system at home that he's actually helping the NATO effort in Kosovo. 
[51:00]
 Yes, I am.  That's how sick Anthony's setup is.  I called in an airstrike the other day from my computer.  It's fun.  Yes.  You can't be bothered with the porno chicks.  Porno.  He's watching stuff.  I'm not naked.  I'm in a parka on my computer, just in case somebody else is naked.  I'm not talking about bothering anybody or porno.  I'm talking about just being used to walking around naked.  He hasn't lived in Manhattan long enough.  But let me tell you something about Anthony.  When he first got into the whole internet thing, he had a sneeze going on his computer. 
[51:30]
 It looked like a salad bar.  I had to hook it up over the keyboard.  Would that keep the sneezes from coming out to you?  Not out of my nose either.  Believe me, everybody when they first get a computer, it's always porn, porn, porn.  I don't care who you are.  If the guy is downstairs and the wife's up in bed and he says, honey, I'm down here doing  the bills, honey, boy, this computer's great.  I'm really doing the bills.  Online banking.  Online banking's a breeze, honey.  I'll be up in 10 minutes. 
[52:00]
 Where is that?  Teenass.com.  You know?  Of course.  You just do that when you first get it.  But after a while, I've had a computer since my Commodore 64.  Back in the early 80s, I got away from, well, I still look at a lot of smut.  But I do other things too.  Well, they can break your IP address or whatever it is.  And then they send you a lot of crap.  And you want that.  No, I'm just talking about walking around naked.  My entire block does it.  Nobody puts their shades up. 
[52:30]
 Not really, yes.  But I wanted to get some diet aids for one of the women who had an apartment across  the street.  They weighed like 400 pounds and she had this melon colored, yes, like orange bikini  underwear.  And that was not nice.  Tell me more.  Yes, yes.  Get me high.  Let's have four recesses.  Sometimes it's better, like the transvestite, but he moved out.  He moved out.  My friend got upset when she saw him dressing up, being dressed by his friend. 
[53:00]
 So where was all this when Aunt Naya and I were put up in the city for a month and a half?  You weren't in the city then?  Yes, we were.  No, no, no, this goes back months.  No, I'm just saying in general, like we...  Oh, where is it going on?  You have to live in one of the crummy little walk-ups.  All right, yes, because I guess in Manhattan, I don't know, we were facing this whole apartment  complex and we didn't see nothing.  We had hundreds of windows to choose from.  We were less than what, 200 feet away? 
[53:30]
 We didn't see anything.  We saw one old lady in a one-piece bathing suit stirring her sauce every night.  She'd be in her kitchen in a one-piece, one of those old lady flowered type of one-pieces.  And her strap would always fall off her shoulder as she stirred that sauce.  Wait, wait, yeah, you stirred that sauce.  I've got to tell you something, and this will be an open-air thing, trivia question down the road.  I think that's the first time I ever heard Anthony use the dirty girl voice.  That's true because I was watching her just go, wait, wait, wait, let me still see. 
[54:00]
 Like, I was watching, I don't know, Sports Center or whatever, just something boring on TV  and it's at the window with the binoculars.  All of a sudden I just hear, you stirred that sauce.  You got that spoon, you grabbed that spoon and stirred that sauce.  I'm like, what the hell are you doing?  It gives me a look and it's this old lady in a one-piece bathing suit just stirring sauce.  You're teasing me with that strap off the shoulder now.  I see it.  Well, I don't know.  I think everybody found out who was moving within seeing range. 
[54:30]
 And they just decided, I'm not going to go near my windows anymore until those Anthony and O.B. Creeks are out.  That must have been it.  I've got a telescope and I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I need someone to come and wash my underwear so that I don't have to walk around half-naked when I'm on the phone or at the computer.  That's great.  All right.  Hello?  Hi.  Okay.  All righty. 
[55:00]
 Okay, well, it's an entertaining show.  I like it.  And you know what?  I guess they're putting the screws to you to get nicer.  To get nicer?  You're not.  All right, watch this.  Screw you, bitch.  There we go.  How about that?  How's that for nice?  But it's... 
[55:30]
 The Ride of New York, 1027W&W.  That's the band, Indigenous.  And now that you're gone, it's Opie and Anthony for the Ride Home.  Hey, hey, hey.  So weird to look over my shoulder, look out the window here.  Daylight savings, Opie.  Nice and bright out.  That's a beautiful thing, isn't it?  I'm a little upset, though, looking at the forecast.  I see USA Today, New York.  Today, blue sky, crisp and cool.  Tuesday, more sun, a delightful day, 65. 
[56:00]
 Wednesday, late showers, 69 degrees.  There's supposed to be showers in the morning and then sunny in the afternoon.  I'll have to pop on CNN and see what the current forecast is.  But we hope for nice days on Wednesday.  Correct.  And for a high boob index.  Yeah, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah, here it is, Chris from Jersey Dudes.  Got to ask, are there any rules for wow regarding temperature to declared an official Whip-Em-Out Wednesday day? 
[56:30]
 Well, Chris, no, but there is a boob sighting index.  The higher the index, the more sightings there will be on any given day.  Correct.  The index is a complex formula we won't go into here related to weather conditions.  It's more complicated than the Doppler 2000.  Oh, yes, yes.  You know the scale they use to measure tornadoes and earthquakes and stuff like that?  This one just is by far much more complicated.  Can't even get into it here, the theory of it.  So, no, every Wednesday until they tell us to stop, which will happen, I'm sure. 
[57:00]
 Oh, mark our words, yes.  That's always the case.  We'll be Whip-Em-Out Wednesday where the ladies are encouraged to flash their fellow commuters.  On the ride home.  All the guys need to do is put a wow in or on their vehicle.  That makes your chances greater.  I saw a lot of trucks out there this weekend driving around with the W-O-W on the back of the truck in the dirt.  The truckers got it easy because all they got to do is rub it into the back of the truck. 
[57:30]
 It's amazing because we put the word out last week.  We begged the truckers to get on the CBs and get their rigs all set for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  And it looks like they heard us, Anthony.  Yes, so this Wednesday we will continue.  And this has just begun.  We only did it one week thus far.  This thing is going to grow out of control.  Oh, yes.  So jump on the bandwagon early here.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, I got the phone calls finally.  We were supposed to play this like two hours ago.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  Ant and I were, how did we come across this tape again? 
[58:00]
 I haven't heard this in years.  I just had some stuff in the car we were going over.  Yeah.  And I found the tape of 2 Bar.  Yeah, with Red the Bartender.  Red the Bartender.  And if you know anything about this tape, it was the inspiration for the whole gag they do on the Simpsons with Mo and Bart.  Yeah.  Calling up the bar and asking for fake names and stuff.  Yeah, the weird names.  Just fill my crack in there.  Yeah, exactly.  Fill my crack in.  So the tape, I don't know, this is an OK copy. 
[58:30]
 This was one of those tapes that in the early 80s where everyone was just dubbing and overdubbing and overdubbing.  And I got like a hundredth generation here.  But I think it's clear enough where you can understand what's going on.  All right.  So you hear Red, the old grumpy Bartender.  His voice is classic.  It sounds like he just married it.  Yeah, he sure did.  Get out of my way.  So take a listen now.  Hello.  Hello.  This is Al.  Al Winger.  No.  Koholik. 
[59:00]
 Al who?  Koholik.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  You won't know nobody by that name.  All right.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes.  This is Tuba?  Yeah.  Yeah, I want to check how they are.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I want to check how they are.  I'm looking for Phil Myers.  M-I-Z-8.  Myers?  Phil Myers.  Myers, yeah. 
[59:30]
 Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  Nobody by that name.  You're not there?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello.  Yeah, I'd like to know if you can tell me if there's an Al Kill U there.  Who?  Al Kill U.  Al Kill U?  Yeah.  Yeah, kill you.  What's his name?  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you. 
[60:00]
 I'll kill you.  No, nobody but Anthony.  Oh, you see, I was supposed to meet a few guys, yeah, you know.  Uh, could you call, uh, how about Stanley Payne?  Is Stanley Payne there, you know?  Stanley Schreiber?  Is that you?  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now?  No.  What's the matter with you? 
[60:30]
 You want to hit a kid in the ear on him?  What?  I see your f***ing bum.  You want to hit me in the butt of a f***ing c***?  I'll come down and kick your f***ing mouth open.  Listen, why should I go out the f***ing mouth?  I'll f*** your mother, you stupid son of a bitch.  Why don't you come down here and have a little knock?  You come down and tell me that face to face.  I'll come down and tell you that face to face.  I'll break your f***ing head off.  I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars? You haven't even gotten a hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you f***ing mother f***er up.  Come over here. 
[61:00]
 Come over here. I'll show you my age, what I'm doing to you.  I'll cut your f***ing balls out.  You mother f***er, you rascal.  You scumbag.  Hello?  I'll speak with Joe, please.  Joe?  Joe, Joe.  Joe, Joe, Joe.  Joe, Joe, Joe.  Not here.  You sure?  Positive. 
[61:30]
 Okay, thanks.  I haven't heard that tape in years.  That's great stuff, man.  God, is that funny.  I'll get your head in.  I'll go high.  I'll kill you.  Joe Dillon.  The guy can't stop laughing.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York.  Days the New, Touch, Peel and Stand, and David Bowie, too.  You're hanging with Hopi and Anthony.  Hello. 
[62:00]
 We got the audio from earlier.  We have a whole new audience listening.  We had Larry Flint on the phone earlier.  The Larry Flint from Hustler Magazine.  Yeah.  And the guy now that has the Flint Report, which is where he's on,  just unmasking the hypocrites, he says.  And he's only focusing on the Republicans.  He's got dirt on a bunch of Republicans, so he says.  Well, it's coming out tomorrow.  It's going to be all over the damn place.  And he's claiming that Mary Bono had an affair while married to Sonny. 
[62:30]
 And then we really couldn't understand anything else he really said.  I remember Larry with Hustler Magazine when I was a kid.  I went over to my friend Roy's house.  He had an issue with Hustler that was it had a scratch and sniff centerfold.  I swear to God.  This is the genius that is Larry Flint who is coming up with new and innovative things.  And I remember I guess I was probably 10 or 11.  And I wouldn't scratch and sniff. 
[63:00]
 And I bet your friend did.  Yeah, he's just like, come on, man.  And he's like the thing was almost scratched through to nothing.  Like there was a hole in it.  He's like, come on, check it out.  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, and he wasn't scratching it.  Check it out.  Check it out.  I'm like, no.  Why would I want to check that out?  All right, so he scratched and sniffed it.  Yeah.  I have to ask, what does it smell like?  I didn't do it.  I didn't scratch it.  Well, did he explain it to you?  Well, you're 11, though.  What is he going to say? 
[63:30]
 Yeah, I know.  So he doesn't have anything to base it on.  There's no way it actually smells like pram.  He just said, ew, it stinks.  I should all have learned that lesson earlier.  Sorry, I had to go there.  Sorry.  Wow.  Thanks for the setup, man.  It's about time you gave me a setup.  Slow pitch softball.  That's awful.  Rick, grab the phones because now I think there's a bunch of people that have tried the scratching 
[64:00]
 sniff because the phones just weren't really interesting.  All right, so Larry Flint was on earlier.  And, well, I don't know.  We asked him about Courtney Love.  Yeah, because she was in the movie, The United States versus Larry Flint.  Correct.  And you asked him a question.  I love that movie, by the way.  Hey, did you ever see Courtney Love naked when you guys were filming that movie?  Yeah, I've seen Courtney's voice a couple times. 
[64:30]
 Yeah.  Love that.  What would you rate it on a scale of one to ten?  I'd rate it for Courtney at wild.  Yeah, wild.  I bet you she showed you some stuff.  She had nice cans in that movie, too.  Did she show you her balloon knot?  Balloon knot.  That's one of the great things about Hustler. 
[65:00]
 You see balloon knots in Hustler.  They're bent over everything.  Well, all right, Larry does want to play.  All right, Larry.  Well, Mr. Flint, thanks for checking in today.  Okay, guys.  I've seen her bust a couple of times.  Well, here's a couple of guys that tried the scratching sniff.  Oh, interesting.  Here we go.  All right, Phil.  Phil.  Hey, Phil.  Oh, wait, wait.  Here we go.  Okay. 
[65:30]
 Hey, Phil.  Yeah, how are you?  All right.  So you tried the scratching sniff?  I remember it well.  All right, be careful now.  What did it smell like?  It didn't smell like the real thing, I'll tell you that.  Well, what did it smell like?  It was, it was smell like perfume, really.  Perfume?  Yeah.  Oh, then it sure didn't.  Like one of those scents and pieces of candy.  It didn't smell like the real thing, so it was kind of disappointing.  Yeah.  All right.  How about that?  I didn't miss anything.  Yeah, not at all.  It was a big disappointment, to tell you the truth.  All right.  And like you said earlier, it was a big disappointment.  Yeah.  It was a big disappointment.  Yeah.  It was a big disappointment.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[66:00]
 Not at all.  Not at all.  It was a big disappointment, to tell you the truth.  All right.  And like you said earlier, it was practically still off at all the people.  Yeah, scratching it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think you wouldn't want to get in the full gist of it unless you bought the magazine.  You were the first one.  Correct, yeah.  The scratching sniffs don't work that good after scratching.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  It was boring, really.  All right, Phil.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks.  But after all these years, I feel good.  I didn't miss much.  No.  JP.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  I'm fine.  I remember in my youth as well, it was smelling like a scratch and sniff hustler. 
[66:30]
 And I expected it to smell like a can of bumblebee, but in reality, it smelled like perfume like  the other guy said.  Yeah, how about that?  And God knows that is not what it smells like.  Well, we don't know who you're dating.  All right.  You bought something that smelled like perfume.  You sent it to me.  All right, JP.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  God, you've got to be kidding me.  Because we always end up here, don't we?  Hey, Debbie, no matter how we try to turn off of this road, we always get detoured right  back.  I know.  The cones are always set up, though.  Hey, Debbie, what do you got?  Hi.  I just wanted to tell you.  Saturday afternoon, I had the TV on while I was cooking. 
[67:00]
 I was watching an old, this old house.  I believe it was old anyway.  And the mayor of Boston appeared.  Don't know.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

Bear with Norm MacDonald's delivery here because he's a little slow.  That's Norm's delivery.  Right.  It takes him a while to get to the punch line, but trust me, there's a payoff here, okay?  All right.  All right.  Take a listen to this from I guess this weekend's Dennis Miller show.  That's great.  I love that.  And then Dennis Miller's got to come out and say, you know, the maturation of your, the 
[70:00]
 maturation.  You know, that's like when the Philistines, you know.  You're like, what is Dennis even talking about?  He has to up a one, you know?  It's like, it's like, it's like let Norm have the laugh.  He had the big laugh there, but you have to outdo him now.  You know, the Zinglifidylidites once said, Phyrinathlone and stockinamaphonger.  And you know, that's just funny.  It's like Dennis, man. 
[70:30]
 What happened to just talking?  The guy must eat dictionaries and thesauruses.  That's the funniest thing I ever heard since the Draklo-mopholes said to Draklo-flockloles  flung the hoof of the loft.  Yeah, what?  What did Dennis say?  And you're in the audience like, ha ha, yeah, ha.  I'm not stupid.  What does he mean?  I can't not laugh or I'll look stupid.  Like I don't know what Flocklo-fleece means, Dennis. 
[71:00]
 What happened to the guy that did the news on SNL?  Oh man, that's good.  Babe.  All right.  Hey, we have an action packed show today.  Making up for Friday's debacle, I guess.  Hey, we had fun Friday.  Yeah, we did have fun.  If you didn't hear it from earlier, we're going to replay the Yoshi song.  Hi.  The Yoshi song.  Yes, there's a Yoshi song now.  And he delivered it personally before.  I don't know if we could get him back in here.  Maybe he's in the area. 
[71:30]
 We'll see.  So he delivers it.  Yeah.  That's the only way to get it.  He doesn't leave his restaurant unless he's delivering food.  So call up with some Ching Flock and Wang Cha and Fah Chang Pak.  All right, so we're going to try to get Yoshi back in here.  I was trying to do the imitation.  I can't do it.  It was close though.  I'm trying.  You're really good at imitations.  I think if you spend a couple of weeks on that you can really get it down.  I can't get the tone that he gets.  Right.  Just think of model airplane. 
[72:00]
 Wang Cha.  See I can't.  I don't know.  All right, we're back on the radio and I don't know what I'm supposed to play here.  What are you doing?  Look, the boss is watching you.  The boss is here.  He distracts us.  And now look, he wanted to chat.  I'm going to have to blame it on the boss.  Oh, this is in your arm already.  Look.  All right, now I've got to wait five seconds for the CD to cue up.  Well, you could talk about it.  What is it?  Bad company.  I don't really want to talk about the song.  Trust me.  Good song.  The Yoshi song on the way. 
[72:30]
 The Rock of New York, 1027W and the latest for the Black Crows, Only a Fool.  The Crows wrapping up their solo tour and then they're going to do a tour with Lenny  Kravitz and Everlast.  That's going to be a cold bill.  May 29th at Jones Beach and May 30th at the PNC Arts Center.  No on sale ticket info yet.  I think they're doing a bunch of dates and then it's going to be Lenny Kravitz and Black  Crows all summer long.

 Music knowledge on our show.  That would be cool to see at the beach.  I can't wait to go to Jones Beach.  I haven't been there in three years.  I was there for the last Aerosmith show that they postponed so it was a little nippy.  Was that like October?  Yeah, I remember they had to postpone it until the weather got cold.  It was still cold but I want to go to the beach for a summer show.  Yes.  I can't wait.  Mmm hmm.  Alrighty.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?

She looked like she wanted to wig out.  And I was trying to explain to her about the Chinese Viagra and the Pong.  I wanted to turn it off but then I said, I want to leave it on.  And went through all the... but you could see that she was getting really insulted.  You know what?  She was nice looking though. 
[74:00]
 Yeah.  I want to know, do they have Chinese Viagra?  Yeah.  Really?  That whole bit we did with Yoshi was based on reality, sort of.  Natural herbs.  A natural herb.  Well, I've got to go back to work tomorrow to finish off the job.  So I want to see what I can do here and see if I can get some of that stuff.  So she's real hot, huh?  Oh yeah, she was nice.
